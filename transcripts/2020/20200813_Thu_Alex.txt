[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.151]  What do the globalists always say?
[00:00:01.191 --> 00:00:02.493]  What do liberals say?
[00:00:02.693 --> 00:00:04.616]  They say all politics is local.
[00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.560]  Think globally.
[00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:08.022]  Act locally.
[00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:38.046]  They run all the cities, they run the schools, they run your children, they run the drug companies, they run the media, and now they're mopping up everything and taking all the resources and all the freedom away, and they've got all the useful idiot followers loving the end of their freedom because they believe they're part of some great thing for the environment when the globalist endgame is not just to overwrite humans but all carbon-based life forms and build a new planet of new life where they will be gods.
[00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:45.249]  Their plan is to kill every whale, every monkey, every bird, every bacteria, and be omnipresent God.
[00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.771]  Their plan is total alien extermination of all life on Earth.
[00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.692]  Their leader is known as Satan.
[00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:57.114]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:00.656 --> 00:01:05.178]  So Alex Jones has been number one on Twitter for most of the day.
[00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:24.554]  And what they do is they take a one-minute clip out of a five-minute video we're about to show you, and they edit it down to a minute so it doesn't make sense, and they say Jones just randomly showed up at a park entrance and started yelling at teenagers who had done nothing wrong.
[00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:26.316]  No.
[00:01:27.728 --> 00:01:42.090]  Just like Governor Newsom shut down all the major beaches of California for six months, and people got angry, and cities got angry, because the healthiest place to be is out in the sun, my wife came in Sunday morning hiking with a friend and said,
[00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:55.879]  These teenagers yelled at us and cussed at us and said, you don't have a reservation, get off this park when it's a 98,000 plus acre park as big as a national park.
[00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:05.122]  Austin has the biggest city parks ever because they had a thing called SOS back in 92 to spend hundreds of millions to forcibly make ranches and farms sell their property.
[00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:10.985]  So a third of Austin towards the west is green because the environmentalists said, we're taking it.
[00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:12.966]  It'll always be a free park for the public.
[00:02:14.806 --> 00:02:16.186]  And so I go, really?
[00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.107]  I mean, I know they've closed all the golf courses that are public.
[00:02:19.127 --> 00:02:20.387]  I know they've closed all the pools.
[00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:25.169]  I know they've closed parks that have like, you know, gym equipment and stuff for kids.
[00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:26.949]  But I meant the green belt?
[00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:28.089]  She goes, yeah, go down there.
[00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.490]  So I called a camera guy, called a security guy.
[00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.370]  In an hour, we met down there.
[00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.351]  And I walk up and I walk through, you're about to see the video.
[00:02:36.164 --> 00:02:38.186]  You have a pass.
[00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:40.868]  I've been coming here since I was in high school and college.
[00:02:41.188 --> 00:02:44.211]  The park is 98,000 plus acres.
[00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:45.272]  Just one piece of it.
[00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:48.515]  And I went, I've been coming here since high school and college.
[00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:56.642]  Now that's the top of Twitter, edited down, so it looks like I'm just yelling at innocent people on phones.
[00:02:56.702 --> 00:02:56.922]  No.
[00:02:57.502 --> 00:02:59.224]  They told me, hey, what are you doing?
[00:02:59.264 --> 00:02:59.844]  Get out of here.
[00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:02.407]  They yelled at my wife hours before.
[00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:06.509]  So again, that's the deception of mainstream media.
[00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.450]  The police go, yeah, there's no law.
[00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.711]  This is because there's no law.
[00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:20.837]  They just said send lifeguards and bureaucrats and trash collectors to go to dozens of entrances and say no one is allowed to go on these giant green belts.
[00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.744]  These people are preying on you.
[00:03:24.044 --> 00:03:25.105]  They're lying to you.
[00:03:25.345 --> 00:03:26.105]  They hope you're stupid.
[00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:28.326]  And, of course, they won't let my response trend.
[00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:29.446]  They'll probably block it.
[00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:30.626]  That's what criminals do.
[00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:34.787]  But it lives at band.video and then fullwords.com and newswords.com.
[00:03:35.287 --> 00:03:37.048]  Here is what they claimed happened.
[00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:39.749]  Then you'll see the full video of what actually happened.
[00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:44.050]  Please realize the globalists count on you not sharing this via your email.
[00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.231]  Via your text message.
[00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:48.311]  Can't do it really on Twitter or Facebook.
[00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:49.071]  You know what happens there.
[00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:51.312]  But the enemy counts on ignorance.
[00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:52.373]  Don't let them win.
[00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.313]  Share this video.
[00:03:56.874 --> 00:04:00.015]  In the past, I've been coming here since I was in high school and college.
[00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:04.937]  And now you guys use your COVID hoax to like set a checkpoint up so you can take over the parks and start charging.
[00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:06.718]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:04:06.998 --> 00:04:08.198]  This is not even a city ordinance.
[00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:11.959]  This is a illegal power grab of the people's green belt.
[00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.320]  And it's time to free Austin.
[00:04:14.298 --> 00:04:15.919]  So are you guys volunteers in the city of Austin?
[00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.100]  Who are you, masked man?
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.762]  I'm a lifeguard for Barton Springs.
[00:04:18.782 --> 00:04:22.184]  You're a lifeguard for Barton Springs, now part of the criminal power grab.
[00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:24.886]  This is outrageous criminal activity.
[00:04:25.587 --> 00:04:27.929]  This is the seizure of the infrastructure of Austin.
[00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.491]  It is all color of law garbage.
[00:04:32.132 --> 00:04:39.498]  My wife came here this morning when you cult member kooks showed up here and you asked her, where's her reservation?
[00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:43.656]  Her reservation is that we live in a free country.
[00:04:44.297 --> 00:04:45.517]  We live in America.
[00:04:45.978 --> 00:04:47.699]  I call for everybody out there watching.
[00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:50.780]  The time for civil disobedience is here.
[00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:53.242]  I want this removed tonight!
[00:04:53.542 --> 00:04:57.324]  COVID-19 is a power grab hoax.
[00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.905]  COVID-19 is a scam.
[00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:01.106]  Is that your IQ?
[00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:02.247]  One finger?
[00:05:03.627 --> 00:05:06.989]  APD just did its job when a man came up and said, can I go in here?
[00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.631]  And the APD told him, no, it's not enforceable.
[00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:14.156]  You can go on in.
[00:05:14.176 --> 00:05:20.979]  With over 100,000 acres, the parks in Austin, Texas are known as some of the most beautiful and widespread in the country.
[00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:30.142]  And in 1992, the Save Our Springs Ordinance was adopted as law, which opened up these beautiful lands to the public.
[00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:34.103]  Austinites practically live in a national park.
[00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:36.105]  Taxpayers paid for it.
[00:05:36.525 --> 00:05:37.927]  It is ours to enjoy.
[00:05:37.947 --> 00:05:39.468]  It is the law.
[00:05:40.248 --> 00:05:45.212]  But now, Austin City Mayor Steven Adler is attempting to seize control.
[00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:56.742]  The year was 1996, and I was producing my first documentary film because it was in the UN Biological Diversity Treaty.
[00:05:58.553 --> 00:06:25.554]  And George Herbert Walker Bush had a few years before signed us on to Agenda 21 and a UNESCO treaty, though never ratified by Congress, that said by the year 2020 they would lock up most of the public lands and that the general public would not be allowed to go on national and state parks without reservations and that it would be about 1% of the numbers previously allowed.
[00:06:28.356 --> 00:06:43.324]  And then we discover under COVID-19 it is the United Nations creating the six-foot social distancing fraud, the massive death toll prediction frauds, the fraud of saying no one has to die to call it a pandemic.
[00:06:45.765 --> 00:06:50.627]  And now they've closed the beaches in California and New Jersey and New York for six months.
[00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:53.429]  They're still trying to close them in California.
[00:06:55.026 --> 00:07:11.603]  All under UN directives and if doctors and scientists come out, if doctors and scientists come out and point out that it's all a fraud, they get banned off of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it.
[00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:16.323]  And they're told the United Nations is in charge.
[00:07:17.023 --> 00:07:18.464]  You disagree with the WHO.
[00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:19.185]  That's not allowed.
[00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:31.072]  If you guys put the map back on screen for TV viewers, that is a map from 1996 put out by Dr. Michael Kaufman, an environmental engineer and expert.
[00:07:34.508 --> 00:07:36.789]  And that map, according to UN Maps, blow it up.
[00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:47.753]  If you see Austin, Texas, exactly where we are, exactly where the red is of the Austin Greenbelt, is where they are now shutting it to the public.
[00:07:49.314 --> 00:07:51.074]  That is the Barton Creek Greenbelt.
[00:07:51.094 --> 00:07:55.456]  If you scroll up, Texas is right there on the bottom.
[00:07:56.716 --> 00:08:00.398]  And you zoom right in where Austin is, you can see
[00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:04.567]  Where they're shutting the whole thing down.
[00:08:04.607 --> 00:08:08.069]  And those are the corridors where no one will be allowed to go.
[00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.590]  Absolute seizure of total control.
[00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.052]  And they're already shutting down state and national park areas.
[00:08:16.072 --> 00:08:17.252]  They're already destroying roads.
[00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:19.693]  They're already trying to keep the public out for many years.
[00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:22.454]  We're upwards of 80% of the land's federal out west.
[00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:26.396]  This is their operation.
[00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.197]  So I put a film out in 1997 called America
[00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:34.145]  Destroyed by design.
[00:08:36.327 --> 00:08:50.380]  And boy are we not seeing that plan to de-industrialize and shut us down and make us a service economy and then declare the service economy obsolete.
[00:08:51.897 --> 00:09:04.827]  It's Agenda 21, signed on at the Rio de Janeiro Conference, right before he left office in 1992, Mr. New World Order, George Herbert Walker Skull and Bones Bush.
[00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:08.130]  Best friends with the Clintons to this day.
[00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:09.491]  Till he died.
[00:09:10.772 --> 00:09:12.814]  And now the Global Clinton Initiative has Bush Jr.
[00:09:12.854 --> 00:09:17.598]  involved in it, and they've graduated from President up to World Government Board level.
[00:09:18.729 --> 00:09:22.752]  And this is directly from the Rockefeller Foundation Lockstep 2010.
[00:09:23.672 --> 00:09:31.457]  Quote, under the guise of a pandemic, we will create a prison state on a planetary scale.
[00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:35.800]  People ask, how did I know all this?
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:41.343]  Well, we have the website that just kind of redirects to InfoWars, but PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:42.404]  I plan a revamp of it.
[00:09:43.339 --> 00:09:43.859]  Very soon.
[00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:47.200]  Prisonplanet.com.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.121]  But you might want to go to the Operation Lockstep document itself.
[00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:52.362]  Let's go there for TV viewers.
[00:09:52.742 --> 00:09:55.343]  Radio listeners, just type in Operation Lockstep, Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:09:55.683 --> 00:09:57.403]  You'll be on the Rockefeller Foundation website.
[00:09:58.704 --> 00:10:08.647]  And they say we'll bring in a planetary prison state, which is a prison planet, under the guise of a pandemic.
[00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:09.727]  Under the guise.
[00:10:10.307 --> 00:10:13.088]  And in my film, Endgame.
[00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:16.222]  E-N-D-G-A-M-E.
[00:10:16.663 --> 00:10:21.466]  End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:10:22.307 --> 00:10:28.792]  We tell you that because before they had the Rockefeller Foundation say that, they had the Club of Rome and the U.N.
[00:10:28.892 --> 00:10:29.252]  say it.
[00:10:29.732 --> 00:10:41.301]  And in leaked North American Union minutes from George Herbert Walker Bush and then later Obama at the secret confabs, they discuss planetary rule.
[00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:49.513]  And they say, we will have tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership.
[00:10:49.993 --> 00:10:50.814]  These are their words.
[00:10:51.174 --> 00:10:59.456]  And they also describe re-education centers you will be sent to, especially if you're white males.
[00:11:01.317 --> 00:11:03.178]  And now, folks working on U.S.
[00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:12.301]  nuclear weapons, federal government's premier nuclear research lab hosted a three-day re-education camp, that's their words, for white males with the goal of exposing
[00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:14.914]  They're whiteness and how that's bad.
[00:11:16.674 --> 00:11:19.435]  So, this is a Hitlerian race-based model.
[00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:43.023]  Where you take the minority of the minority, whites of the minority, about 8% worldwide, so half of those male, 4%, and you teach they're bad, and corporate trillionaire, they control trillion, white men, direct the operation and train the brown people to be racist, and then organize the whole planet around that, destroying what middle class is left on the planet.
[00:11:45.742 --> 00:11:49.505]  Full report from InformationLiberation.com is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:50.026 --> 00:11:50.206]  U.S.
[00:11:50.226 --> 00:11:52.488]  Nuclear Research Lab hosts a re-education camp for white males.
[00:11:52.728 --> 00:11:58.974]  Go read it for yourself, where they have to declare themselves bad and evil and the things that are not good.
[00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.436]  President Trump being white.
[00:12:02.317 --> 00:12:07.421]  You have to associate yourself with the KKK and mass killings and agree that you are a bad person.
[00:12:08.222 --> 00:12:12.746]  Mom, golf, baseball, apple pie are all bad as well.
[00:12:13.797 --> 00:12:14.957]  Now, I'm not joking.
[00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:15.797]  This is not a joke.
[00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:22.179]  Just like the official City of Austin budget says proposal, blow up the police station.
[00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:27.680]  This is a communist takeover with billionaires running the whole thing.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.021]  And because there's nothing we won't put up with, there's no limit to what they'll do.
[00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:39.483]  Remember, Hillary said we need re-education camps for men and for adults.
[00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:41.490]  People said, what does that mean?
[00:12:42.231 --> 00:12:44.093]  Obama, it came out in 2010.
[00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:46.676]  The document was from then, but it came out a few years later.
[00:12:46.716 --> 00:12:47.117]  We got it.
[00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:47.858]  People didn't believe it.
[00:12:48.118 --> 00:12:48.518]  It was real.
[00:12:48.538 --> 00:12:49.780]  The Army said, no, that's a real document.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.161]  They leaked it to us, by the way.
[00:12:53.704 --> 00:12:54.285]  They didn't like it.
[00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:59.300]  It said, we're going to have re-education camps in America.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.940]  They were hiring re-education camp specialists for during a civil war.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.221]  They described processing Americans in with their social security numbers.
[00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:15.123]  Let's type in, Obama DOD document describes re-education camps for right-wingers.
[00:13:16.983 --> 00:13:18.423]  You can read the document, it's public.
[00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:22.024]  About a year after we broke it, the Army itself put it on its website.
[00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:26.272]  So it's not the Army's even our enemy.
[00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:31.976]  The globalists want control of the military and the police to then make them carry out the pure evil.
[00:13:32.116 --> 00:13:43.744]  And that's what putting in the district attorneys and the county attorneys and the state attorney generals and stacking the FBI with their people is about, is living in a real police state.
[00:13:46.085 --> 00:13:47.606]  Now we have a bunch of big guests today.
[00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:51.429]  Jay Dyer is going to be interviewing very well-known
[00:13:53.206 --> 00:14:10.323]  Top of the food chain comedian Sam Hyde, Ali Alexander, journalist and analysis expert will be joining us to talk about Kamala Harris and just how evil she is and what's up with her and so much more today.
[00:14:12.239 --> 00:14:21.484]  But you have to understand, we have fought, thanks to your support, to just stay in position to be on radio and TV stations, to have InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and to have BandOnVideo.
[00:14:22.045 --> 00:14:24.026]  And yeah, we have a lot of videos that get over a million views.
[00:14:24.086 --> 00:14:25.987]  Our top video has about four and a half million views.
[00:14:26.567 --> 00:14:28.028]  We really need videos with 10 million views.
[00:14:28.248 --> 00:14:30.150]  And I don't make money off the advertising that's on them.
[00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.672]  We take the money we make from the radio show and people buying the products.
[00:14:33.732 --> 00:14:37.314]  We put it back into the bandwidth and the infrastructure that's millions of dollars a quarter.
[00:14:38.775 --> 00:14:46.541]  So it takes a lot of money to do this, and we appreciate you, but we want to pay a lot of money for Bandwidth because we want to reach people.
[00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:50.224]  So go to Band.Video, click the left-hand link.
[00:14:50.705 --> 00:14:55.429]  It'll pull down a menu of all the different channels, and there's the band videos of Band.Video.
[00:14:55.709 --> 00:14:57.731]  That's all the medical doctors, scientists, and nurses.
[00:14:58.993 --> 00:15:03.797]  Those are the most viral videos that have been banned off Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and they are so pissed those even exist.
[00:15:03.817 --> 00:15:08.301]  They are fighting around the clock to bring down that banned section.
[00:15:08.321 --> 00:15:12.424]  In fact, I want that banned section on the left-hand side of banned video put to the top.
[00:15:12.784 --> 00:15:18.569]  I don't want Alex Jones to be at the top, or Owen Schroeder, or David Nye, or Paul Watson, or John Bowne, or even David Icke.
[00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:24.354]  I want those banned doctors and whistleblowers at the top of the navigation bar.
[00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:25.334]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:25.354 --> 00:15:25.815]  Stay with us.
[00:15:27.105 --> 00:15:29.687]  So here's the Rockefeller Foundation 2010.
[00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:33.930]  Under the guise of a pandemic, we will create a prison state.
[00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.210]  Close quote.
[00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:36.932]  Here's another quote.
[00:15:37.012 --> 00:15:44.537]  A world of tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback.
[00:15:46.918 --> 00:15:50.761]  You know, just the main synopsis document is five pages long.
[00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:56.940]  But it's linked to several hundred pages that I read more than a decade ago.
[00:15:57.521 --> 00:16:05.144]  This got picked up and put into reports with the headline, flash mobs and brain chips, a grim vision of the future of the London Guardian.
[00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:08.506]  And the British Ministry of Defence put out a similar report.
[00:16:09.346 --> 00:16:13.368]  This is the plan.
[00:16:15.129 --> 00:16:17.150]  And so people ask, hey, what's it like?
[00:16:18.671 --> 00:16:20.592]  What's it like to
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.461]  Be made fun of by all the major nighttime comic shows.
[00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:30.302]  What's it like to have them edit videos of you and make it the number one thing on Twitter?
[00:16:30.742 --> 00:16:35.004]  And the number one thing on Twitter yesterday was, Alex Jones is a child molester.
[00:16:37.064 --> 00:16:40.225]  Alex Jones sent child porn to Sandy Hook families.
[00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:41.686]  That's totally not true.
[00:16:43.686 --> 00:16:46.767]  But that's my punishment for exposing these people.
[00:16:46.787 --> 00:16:47.567]  But that's okay.
[00:16:48.028 --> 00:16:48.828]  Because did you hear?
[00:16:49.963 --> 00:17:14.836]  They predict you're going to end up waking up finally, but they're going to have combat robots, and you're not going to have any jobs or any land to farm on, so you won't know how to take care of yourself, and they're going to make you acquiesce to sterilization, to even be able to get your food credit card, and you're going to end up taking plantable chips, and then finally, they'll say, hey, if you want to live like a king for a year and travel the world,
[00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:19.911]  Sign on to this agreement that you're going to euthanize yourself in one year.
[00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:22.172]  That's the official plan!
[00:17:24.772 --> 00:17:33.615]  And I sit here watching our free, rich society destroyed, and people think, hey, what's it like to be number one on Reddit and them lying about you and making fun of you?
[00:17:33.675 --> 00:17:37.916]  What's it like to be number one on Twitter with them lying about you and saying you're a child molester?
[00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:39.996]  Well, I'm exposing child molesters.
[00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:41.577]  What do you think they're going to do?
[00:17:44.053 --> 00:17:47.397]  It's like in the movies when they catch the bad guy finally and he goes, no, it's him!
[00:17:47.417 --> 00:17:49.459]  To whoever's busting him.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:56.166]  I have integrity and I am proud to be number one on Twitter them saying I'm a child molester.
[00:17:56.566 --> 00:18:01.051]  I am proud for them to say I'm a joke and a liar and Walter Sobchak.
[00:18:01.452 --> 00:18:02.353]  I like Walter Sobchak.
[00:18:03.114 --> 00:18:04.334]  At least he stands there for what he believes in.
[00:18:05.175 --> 00:18:21.560]  And, so, you're all gonna see, you're all gonna get cancer, your kids are all gonna be mentally retarded, it's gonna get so hellish that you'll finally won't be able to deny it, and by then, you're gonna be spiritually, culturally tied up in the back of the truck going to the dungeon.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.222]  And I'm not talking to our general audience, I'm talking to everybody that thinks all of this is so incredibly funny.
[00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:45.535]  So, I can sit here and read to you the Bill and Melinda Gates lockstep document or show you two days of the public war game they did with all the top globalists admitting the takeover and the social distancing and the lockdown.
[00:18:45.755 --> 00:18:47.055]  This is in October and November.
[00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:51.516]  Two months, but they televised two days of it.
[00:18:51.576 --> 00:18:54.057]  I mean, I've sat there and watched most of the two days.
[00:18:54.517 --> 00:18:55.398]  You know what else I watched?
[00:18:55.758 --> 00:19:00.519]  Two days of the December 2nd, December 3rd UN meeting in Switzerland.
[00:19:04.653 --> 00:19:06.774]  Where they admitted the vaccines don't work.
[00:19:07.055 --> 00:19:08.575]  We're giving them by Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:19:08.896 --> 00:19:10.497]  The doctors believe they're hurting people.
[00:19:10.677 --> 00:19:11.898]  The front line is wobbly.
[00:19:12.178 --> 00:19:13.519]  We can't cover this up anymore.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.021]  The truth is, it's all right there.
[00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:25.946]  And the truth is, the Arnold Schwarzeneggers and people of the world, the governors, the minions, they know all this is real.
[00:19:26.006 --> 00:19:26.927]  They know what's happening.
[00:19:28.439 --> 00:19:31.881]  So they're out telling you, good job, you are not out on the street.
[00:19:32.321 --> 00:19:34.482]  I am allowed to be out, you are not allowed to be.
[00:19:34.743 --> 00:19:35.743]  I live in a big mansion.
[00:19:36.063 --> 00:19:37.965]  Stay in your house, do as you are told.
[00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:44.228]  Because he was trained by Kurt Voltheim, the head of the United Nations, who was an SS officer.
[00:19:44.828 --> 00:19:45.529]  So was his father.
[00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:49.991]  And it's not that Nazis run the New World Order.
[00:19:52.073 --> 00:19:55.995]  It's that they are a good component of it.
[00:19:57.503 --> 00:19:58.423]  And a spinoff of it.
[00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:07.828]  And so, if you won't stand up for yourself, wolves are gonna come in and take everything you've got, ever had, or ever will have.
[00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.031]  And so, I know I'm right.
[00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:13.411]  I know what's coming next.
[00:20:14.192 --> 00:20:17.634]  I tell you what's coming next because it's all right here.
[00:20:19.194 --> 00:20:25.738]  And whether you're in Thailand, or whether you're in Germany, or whether you're in Canada, or whether you're in the United States, or Australia, or New Zealand,
[00:20:27.093 --> 00:20:34.698]  The exact same systems are rolling out, but in New Zealand, in Australia, and in Spain, they're a little ahead of us in New Zealand.
[00:20:35.098 --> 00:20:42.662]  Kids being taught they can never touch anyone again, being locked in plastic bubbles, directly out of Alfred Kinsey and Skinner and the rest of it.
[00:20:44.183 --> 00:20:46.004]  Restaurants doing it now, officially.
[00:20:46.084 --> 00:20:47.305]  It was a joke a few months ago.
[00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:47.846]  No, it wasn't.
[00:20:48.226 --> 00:20:51.628]  Now, rock concerts, music concerts, where you're in cages.
[00:20:54.363 --> 00:20:55.485]  Nothing to do with viruses.
[00:20:55.525 --> 00:20:57.988]  It's about trained to be led into cages.
[00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.113]  This isn't some little side thing.
[00:21:02.214 --> 00:21:03.655]  This is the carbon tax.
[00:21:03.956 --> 00:21:05.298]  This is the world government.
[00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:11.766]  This is teaching you that you can't ever use the National Park or State Park again.
[00:21:13.109 --> 00:21:17.732]  Except by reservation, because the globalists don't want you doing it.
[00:21:18.012 --> 00:21:20.753]  They're gonna get rid of the international air travel, like it was.
[00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:23.015]  They're gonna get rid of the cruise ships.
[00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:25.816]  They're getting rid of all of it!
[00:21:27.837 --> 00:21:37.103]  This was just the process of getting you dumbed down and decadent, and distracted, making it all a big wonderland, all a big party, just like the Allegory of Pinocchio.
[00:21:38.114 --> 00:21:51.663]  Where they need Pinocchio to become corrupt first, so they liquor him up, they have him rob, break some things, be a hooligan, and that turns them into a jackass so they can be loaded on a slave ship and taken to a mine on an island to be prisoners.
[00:21:54.224 --> 00:22:05.852]  And now, we're turning into the jackass, y'know, y'know, led by jackasses, and we're being taken to that prison island right now.
[00:22:08.479 --> 00:22:16.716]  So I hope everyone enjoys it because they need you to metaphysically comply.
[00:22:17.137 --> 00:22:18.419]  And so it goes like this.
[00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:24.048]  Only a 15-day lockdown to keep the hospitals clear.
[00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:25.209]  That was a lie.
[00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.792]  Only a month long of masks.
[00:22:28.832 --> 00:22:30.314]  Only a six-month, only a two-year.
[00:22:30.674 --> 00:22:33.837]  Oh, sorry, you gotta wear them forever, Fauci in the UN says.
[00:22:34.497 --> 00:22:36.739]  Oh, you gotta have contact tracers at your house to come visit you.
[00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:38.320]  And yeah, we gotta break families up.
[00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:43.665]  Already being bed-attested in Spain, and in Australia, and in England, and in New Zealand.
[00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:45.184]  Total lockdowns.
[00:22:45.284 --> 00:22:45.645]  Oh, sorry.
[00:22:45.665 --> 00:22:47.026]  You haven't stayed in your house for months.
[00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:47.947]  We'll bring you food.
[00:22:48.648 --> 00:22:51.011]  You're being taught how obsolete you are.
[00:22:51.391 --> 00:22:53.053]  How non-essential.
[00:22:53.313 --> 00:22:55.095]  Non-essential means obsolete.
[00:22:56.177 --> 00:22:57.078]  You are obsolete!
[00:23:04.042 --> 00:23:12.912]  You've positioned yourself with no bargaining chips, and then the inoculations, which they say aren't forced, but if you want a job, or to fly on a plane, or get on a bus, you gotta have it.
[00:23:13.133 --> 00:23:20.882]  So, so, so, so, next before that is the bracelets, and the tracking apps, and, oh, getting your temperature checked, oh, you've got a bracelet, you've been tested for COVID.
[00:23:21.322 --> 00:23:23.344]  Oh, you've had your temperature checked, you're all suspect.
[00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:32.488]  And it sets up these internal checkpoints while the borders stay wide open and we're taught that white people are the devil and they've got to be sent to, quote, re-education camps.
[00:23:32.728 --> 00:23:37.690]  They call it that name when it's a three-day brainwashing, getting you ready for the real re-education camps.
[00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.370]  It's like they talk about overthrowing Trump with the military.
[00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.371]  They're very serious.
[00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:45.472]  They just say it and say it to condition you because you'll put up with anything.
[00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:50.214]  From Operation Lockstep, Rockefeller Foundation, 2010.
[00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:56.906]  Quote, under the guise of a pandemic, we will create a prison state.
[00:23:58.567 --> 00:24:06.014]  A world of tighter, top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback.
[00:24:09.476 --> 00:24:11.078]  It's only a five-page synopsis.
[00:24:11.098 --> 00:24:11.918]  You might want to go read it.
[00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:13.260]  Just type in Operation Lockstep.
[00:24:14.167 --> 00:24:22.653]  And Operation Lockstep is the directive for the Rockefeller-Ford-Carnegie endowments that Bill and Melinda Gates takes directives from.
[00:24:22.713 --> 00:24:23.633]  By the way, that's on record.
[00:24:23.673 --> 00:24:28.136]  I can play you the galas where they have the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation events.
[00:24:29.217 --> 00:24:35.261]  And they thank Bill and Melinda Gates, and they say, thank you for your World Depopulation Fund, and they all clap.
[00:24:35.461 --> 00:24:40.204]  Because their fund's actually technically named World Population Control Fund.
[00:24:43.487 --> 00:24:50.211]  And again, I can play you all these movies and TV shows, fiction, non-fiction, how humans are bad, let's get rid of everybody.
[00:24:51.071 --> 00:24:56.694]  But as soon as you talk to a Bill Maher who says he wants to get rid of the population, more death, more suicide, get the highway moving.
[00:24:58.075 --> 00:24:59.015]  Well, do you want to die?
[00:24:59.035 --> 00:25:01.156]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:25:01.196 --> 00:25:02.317]  He means you need to die.
[00:25:04.998 --> 00:25:09.381]  There's a popular comedian I sent, Daria, a clip of this few days and we never played it.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.943]  He was on Joe Rogan's show, but he was on, talking about depopulation.
[00:25:13.963 --> 00:25:20.288]  I want to find that, maybe play that next segment, because it's all so cute, it's all so funny, until it's you.
[00:25:20.528 --> 00:25:22.270]  Let me explain something about population.
[00:25:24.431 --> 00:25:35.741]  And Prager University does great analysis of this, it's 100% accurate, but if you're in the ocean, you could swim, or with a submarine,
[00:25:40.347 --> 00:25:49.589]  And you could go sometimes a hundred miles along a coastline before you run into some coral reef or a wrecked ship or something.
[00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:57.471]  And as soon as you come up that wrecked ship, you will see thousands of fish everywhere and stingrays and sharks.
[00:26:01.932 --> 00:26:07.433]  I've got a little lake house and the neighbor goes and he just doesn't put Christmas trees in the water.
[00:26:07.693 --> 00:26:09.854]  He just goes and puts post in the water.
[00:26:10.933 --> 00:26:17.056]  And then we cast out to those posts 20 yards out and catch bass because the bass just like to be around a post.
[00:26:18.657 --> 00:26:19.998]  And see, that's the thing about population.
[00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:28.643]  You can get in your car and you can drive in parts of America for five hours and not see another person when you take a side road.
[00:26:29.483 --> 00:26:34.526]  You take the main road, yeah, you'll see cars here and there, but as far as I can see, you won't see a house maybe for an hour.
[00:26:36.738 --> 00:26:38.580]  Now, is India overpopulated?
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.141]  Are areas of Africa overpopulated?
[00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:41.942]  Are areas of Latin America overpopulated?
[00:26:42.022 --> 00:26:45.625]  Is there an issue of people having 10 kids and then not having jobs in the future?
[00:26:46.066 --> 00:26:47.827]  Absolutely!
[00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.453]  But if you industrialize, people have less than two children on average.
[00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:56.571]  I don't know.
[00:27:13.123 --> 00:27:20.509]  And I've read their writings and to them it's an excuse for power and control over life and death.
[00:27:20.589 --> 00:27:26.534]  It's not about building people up and empowering them and giving them money and convincing them not to have more than two kids.
[00:27:27.034 --> 00:27:29.136]  It's about dumbing people down.
[00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:33.700]  The fluoride in the water, the GMOs, the vaccines that are designed to lower IQ.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.124]  And then I can show you where they admit Bertrand Russell and others saying
[00:27:38.404 --> 00:27:42.747]  We're going to put fluoride in the water, and we're going to put chemicals in vaccines to lower IQ.
[00:27:43.208 --> 00:27:44.369]  He said this in the 40s.
[00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:50.353]  He won international prizes for it, including Nobel, if memory serves.
[00:27:51.374 --> 00:28:03.944]  He proposed setting up a world government and nuking cities to depopulate, and then to never have war after the world government carries out a nuking process to get rid of 90% of the population.
[00:28:04.324 --> 00:28:04.885]  And the left
[00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:12.332]  One time, Rick Linklater was at my office, and he's a nice guy, an intellectual liberal, you know, at a certain level.
[00:28:13.032 --> 00:28:17.173]  And Rick's defended me when I've been attacked by everybody else, I don't know, but he goes, you read Bertrand Russell?
[00:28:17.473 --> 00:28:20.414]  And he got the book, he's like, oh, he's the greatest liberal ever.
[00:28:20.434 --> 00:28:26.576]  I'm like, did you read where he said, set up world government and kill almost everybody to end war?
[00:28:26.596 --> 00:28:30.717]  And he goes, Rick's like, well, I have seen some of those writings, very interesting.
[00:28:31.177 --> 00:28:32.758]  You know, I've got to get going.
[00:28:38.697 --> 00:28:39.879]  Is it my office or his office?
[00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:40.881]  I don't know, I just remember that.
[00:28:41.923 --> 00:28:43.225]  Maybe I pulled it off his shelf.
[00:28:43.766 --> 00:28:49.777]  The point is, is that this is so mainstream, folks, and you just don't read it!
[00:28:51.533 --> 00:28:54.515]  But Jay Dyer's coming up in the fourth hour.
[00:28:54.575 --> 00:28:55.375]  He's a smart guy.
[00:28:55.435 --> 00:28:56.596]  He goes and reads this stuff.
[00:28:56.956 --> 00:28:59.238]  I've gotten where I can't even read it anymore, the new stuff.
[00:28:59.538 --> 00:28:59.998]  I should be.
[00:29:00.379 --> 00:29:04.461]  He was reading the head of the Davos Group, a book from two years ago, admitting all of this even worse.
[00:29:05.182 --> 00:29:09.765]  How humans will be obsolete, how the robots are going to take over, how they're doing it on purpose.
[00:29:12.466 --> 00:29:16.449]  And I'm sitting here asking everyone, do you really want to go through this?
[00:29:19.209 --> 00:29:23.690]  And then I watched them take state and federal parks and they're doing it all over Europe.
[00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:30.211]  And then Paul Watson wrote an article about how they're really shutting down freedom and how they're shutting down parks around the world now.
[00:29:30.231 --> 00:29:31.031]  It's very, very serious.
[00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:33.752]  And the commenters are all like, yeah, I'm in Spain.
[00:29:33.792 --> 00:29:34.752]  Yeah, I'm in Japan.
[00:29:34.992 --> 00:29:35.832]  Yeah, I'm in Canada.
[00:29:35.852 --> 00:29:36.893]  Hey, I'm out in Colorado.
[00:29:37.193 --> 00:29:41.754]  Yeah, they just shut down the whole national park here and said, you can't come in or you got to get a reservation.
[00:29:41.974 --> 00:29:43.894]  And then they're turning back 90% of people.
[00:29:46.054 --> 00:29:48.795]  I mean, they're having open world government summits.
[00:29:51.877 --> 00:29:57.240]  And saying COVID-19 is the way for world government, it's being openly announced.
[00:29:59.061 --> 00:30:07.387]  And so, I show up at the park, huge park, Greenbelt, hundreds of square miles, where my wife was told she had to be out, couldn't come in there.
[00:30:07.867 --> 00:30:14.071]  And I'm watching them turn away families that didn't, weren't told it was closed, with little snot-nosed teenagers going, yeah, yeah, it's closed.
[00:30:14.091 --> 00:30:15.632]  You have to get a reservation and it's full.
[00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:18.442]  I go there, get in their face, explain it.
[00:30:18.602 --> 00:30:20.803]  The police go, he's right, you can't stop people.
[00:30:21.003 --> 00:30:23.305]  There's actually not a law, because somebody pointed out it was color law.
[00:30:23.525 --> 00:30:24.425]  That's a huge victory.
[00:30:24.685 --> 00:30:28.968]  Twitter adds it down to one minute and says I just came and screamed at innocent people.
[00:30:29.508 --> 00:30:31.469]  No, they went and hid after they yelled at me.
[00:30:31.589 --> 00:30:32.670]  I walked through, they yell at me.
[00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.011]  They say you're not allowed to, no, the park's full.
[00:30:36.832 --> 00:30:38.933]  And then I went and showed families being turned away by them.
[00:30:39.353 --> 00:30:40.634]  Seven cop cars show up.
[00:30:41.014 --> 00:30:42.155]  They go, Alex is right.
[00:30:43.035 --> 00:30:43.915]  This is unenforceable.
[00:30:44.456 --> 00:30:45.636]  You guys can't be doing this.
[00:30:45.716 --> 00:30:48.578]  And the police on video order them out.
[00:30:49.798 --> 00:30:50.999]  And that's in my full report.
[00:30:51.319 --> 00:30:52.760]  They say, hey, you guys out of here.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.941]  But what do you do when you're Austin American Statesman?
[00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:56.962]  You murder truth.
[00:30:58.142 --> 00:31:02.024]  So they put out the lie yesterday morning with the edited video promoted.
[00:31:02.824 --> 00:31:03.465]  It was pushed.
[00:31:03.545 --> 00:31:04.905]  It's on national TV as well.
[00:31:05.306 --> 00:31:06.826]  Eight plus million views on Twitter.
[00:31:07.166 --> 00:31:08.027]  Number one on Twitter.
[00:31:09.588 --> 00:31:11.789]  Jones is Walter's show pick.
[00:31:12.608 --> 00:31:22.994]  From the Big Lebowski, he just randomly shows up, for no reason, and yells at people who flip him off.
[00:31:23.694 --> 00:31:29.898]  No, when you hear on the audio, I walk by, I was going to ignore him, but I do this, and they go, hey, what are you doing?
[00:31:30.958 --> 00:31:31.859]  You got a pass?
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.282]  And the city's proposed charging for the Greenbelt.
[00:31:37.542 --> 00:31:39.703]  That's what this is, all the beginning of them taking control.
[00:31:43.226 --> 00:31:48.488]  And they put snot-nosed teenagers who were laughing at me, and I'd hear them go, F you.
[00:31:48.828 --> 00:31:50.309]  Then I'd walk over and say, you got a problem?
[00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:51.029]  Uh, nothing.
[00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:51.890]  Leave me alone.
[00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.331]  And I'm like, oh, it's so pathetic.
[00:31:55.371 --> 00:32:03.374]  But that's the United Nations telling me, you can't have a medical doctor on your show saying hydroxychloroquine treated a thousand patients perfectly.
[00:32:03.835 --> 00:32:04.275]  You're banned.
[00:32:04.935 --> 00:32:06.516]  Doctors can't speak, UN says.
[00:32:06.897 --> 00:32:08.318]  UN says we're taking over this land.
[00:32:08.918 --> 00:32:11.461]  UN says we're in control of your medical system.
[00:32:11.821 --> 00:32:13.302]  UN says we're in control of your carbon.
[00:32:13.662 --> 00:32:17.025]  UN says, UN says, UN says, UN says, UN says.
[00:32:17.325 --> 00:32:17.586]  See?
[00:32:17.766 --> 00:32:19.007]  The UN takeover's here.
[00:32:19.467 --> 00:32:20.928]  And it was never going to be blue helmets.
[00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:24.071]  It's bureaucracy.
[00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:28.034]  They take control of your police and your government with the Strong Cities Initiative.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:34.644]  And they render your federal government obsolete because the states and counties and cities are under their control.
[00:32:34.704 --> 00:32:35.825]  What do the globalists always say?
[00:32:35.865 --> 00:32:37.186]  What do liberals say?
[00:32:37.366 --> 00:32:39.307]  They say all politics is local.
[00:32:40.228 --> 00:32:41.249]  Seek globally.
[00:32:41.929 --> 00:32:42.710]  Act locally.
[00:32:43.621 --> 00:33:12.742]  They run all the cities, they run the schools, they run your children, they run the drug companies, they run the media, and now they're mopping up everything, and taking all the resources and all the freedom away, and they got all the useful idiot followers loving the end of their freedom because they believe they're part of some great thing for the environment, when the globalist endgame is not just to overwrite humans, but all carbon-based life forms, and build a new planet of new life, where they will be gods.
[00:33:13.362 --> 00:33:19.946]  Their plan is to kill every whale, every monkey, every bird, every bacteria, and be omnipresent God.
[00:33:20.307 --> 00:33:24.449]  Their plan is total alien extermination of all life on Earth.
[00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:26.351]  Their leader is known as Satan.
[00:33:26.951 --> 00:33:30.854]  We are on the march, but the globalists are counter-striking right now.
[00:33:31.734 --> 00:33:33.175]  The empire has struck back.
[00:33:33.716 --> 00:33:34.716]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:35.917 --> 00:33:40.240]  Alright, and I didn't quite explain what I was getting into last segment, so somebody might not have got it.
[00:33:41.903 --> 00:33:43.864]  Cities are like coral reefs in the ocean.
[00:33:44.704 --> 00:33:51.848]  The humans are there, you go there because there's the business, there's the jobs, there's the concentration of people, so there's more opportunity on average.
[00:33:52.789 --> 00:34:01.873]  But then you always have parasites that move in, corrupt governments that move in, start taxing the wealth and then drive people out of the city and it falls apart.
[00:34:02.353 --> 00:34:04.514]  Same thing happens to nations or cultures or systems.
[00:34:06.055 --> 00:34:11.298]  Many times civilizations didn't fall because of environmental issues, they fell because of the ruling establishment
[00:34:12.773 --> 00:34:14.775]  was so decadent, so inbred, and so insane.
[00:34:15.856 --> 00:34:17.658]  And so it's just like coral reefs in the ocean.
[00:34:17.698 --> 00:34:24.424]  You can go hundreds of miles and not see a coral reef, and not see hardly any fish, but suddenly you get near a coral reef, it's got fish everywhere.
[00:34:25.625 --> 00:34:26.926]  That's how population works.
[00:34:28.307 --> 00:34:35.874]  Now, it's true that modern civilization is like humans going to Mars in a year-long mission.
[00:34:36.895 --> 00:34:39.298]  And when you get there, even somebody that can run marathons
[00:34:40.825 --> 00:34:45.727]  Is going to have trouble walking, and is going to have serious trouble breathing, even in the reduced gravity of Mars.
[00:34:47.888 --> 00:34:50.049]  Well, that's what modern civilization's like.
[00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:59.953]  Yeah, we got antibiotics to stop a lot of bugs, but we're really weak now, and it kills our normal flora, and so we get cancer more often, and now the antibiotics aren't working.
[00:35:01.394 --> 00:35:06.356]  But that was all the parallel of regular science, hit or miss, a pro-human future being built.
[00:35:07.947 --> 00:35:34.528]  But the robber barons, going back about 150 years ago, openly began to research the science of population control, and so they've had the parallel of that building next to us, and now with computers they're able, in automation, to supplant humans and really control us and track us, and so now the old track of the Renaissance, the pro-human future, is being degraded and shut down, and we're being forced over onto the new track.
[00:35:35.319 --> 00:35:55.765]  Now it's true, the renaissance that's set up by incredibly altruistic, hardcore, God-fearing visionaries, like our forefathers, and other visionaries that didn't believe in the same God, but were visionaries, they can speak, you know, five, six, seven languages, they believed in human empowerment.
[00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:06.439]  But they knew that it would create a largess, it would create a lot of money and a lot of diversions and a lot of corrupt culture and that we would go into a decadent cycle and corruption would set back in.
[00:36:06.499 --> 00:36:12.885]  So they created separation of powers to try to stop dictatorship and or mob rule.
[00:36:13.245 --> 00:36:14.706]  We're also a republic, stop that.
[00:36:15.787 --> 00:36:18.790]  But the nation's almost 250 years old.
[00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:22.814]  We're facing the same disease as every other successful wealthy nation.
[00:36:24.116 --> 00:36:35.987]  And the so-called guardians of humanity, the guardians of the galaxy, are transhumanists that believe they're fallen, we're fallen, we're broken, they hate themselves, they hate us even more, and they're projecting their hate onto us.
[00:36:36.307 --> 00:36:41.732]  And so they want to overwrite the whole planet in a mad dash of wanting godhood and life extension.
[00:36:42.793 --> 00:36:50.160]  And by not caring and hating the earth and hating themselves and believing they're going to only become powerful by giving up their humanity, they have no guilt.
[00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:55.361]  And no care about what happens to others, because it's survival of the fittest.
[00:36:55.941 --> 00:37:00.484]  You deserve what's happening to you, because you bought into their lie.
[00:37:01.225 --> 00:37:05.907]  But that's why they've always got to tell you they're lying to you, and they've got to trick you into giving up your free will.
[00:37:06.188 --> 00:37:16.594]  Because metaphysically, there is a law of the universe that if someone doesn't do something of their free will, even if you trick them, then you karmically, or we put you so, it comes back on you.
[00:37:18.254 --> 00:37:21.136]  But if you can trick someone, they believe it doesn't.
[00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:22.097]  And of course it really does.
[00:37:22.697 --> 00:37:23.678]  Just not as immediate.
[00:37:24.058 --> 00:37:27.760]  So they understand the laws of the universe, but only so far.
[00:37:32.123 --> 00:37:35.445]  So the mainline religion is now a post-humanist exterminism.
[00:37:35.946 --> 00:37:37.207]  And it's all the headlines everywhere.
[00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:38.871]  And that's the big issue.
[00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:40.992]  Looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:37:41.012 --> 00:37:41.672]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:37:41.872 --> 00:37:42.853]  The World Without Humans.
[00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:43.393]  New York Times.
[00:37:43.613 --> 00:37:44.454]  How beautiful it will be.
[00:37:44.654 --> 00:37:45.274]  How great it will be.
[00:37:45.434 --> 00:37:50.397]  But really it's a bunch of evil people wanting to control the destiny of humanity so they control our trajectory.
[00:37:51.478 --> 00:37:54.460]  The other side of the trajectory is nowhere.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.521]  The most selfish, demonic thing you could ever imagine.
[00:37:57.541 --> 00:38:05.306]  But we, in the decadent cycle, they're making their move, are mesmerized and not aware of our potential and think there's either no hope or we don't care.
[00:38:07.657 --> 00:38:16.432]  Now here's a little short report on Operation Lockstep and the United Nations Rockefeller operation being captained by Bill Gates.
[00:38:16.472 --> 00:38:16.752]  Here it is.
[00:38:18.351 --> 00:38:27.078]  In 2010, they had the Rockefeller Foundation script a plan to introduce martial law and a permanent method for total control of the citizenry.
[00:38:27.318 --> 00:38:39.208]  In this plan that they disguised as an academic scenario, as they called it, the method they would use to gain complete prison-like control of the entire population was to infect them.
[00:38:39.828 --> 00:38:51.755]  With a devastating biological pandemic, and then, under the guise of protecting us from this threat, they would be free to implement their final solution, a prison state.
[00:38:52.015 --> 00:39:01.440]  It's called Lockstep, a world of tighter, top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership, with limited innovation.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.221]  I think?
[00:39:19.622 --> 00:39:30.873]  Prepared nations were quickly overwhelmed when the virus streaked around the world infecting nearly 20% of the global population and killing 8 million in just 7 months.
[00:39:31.333 --> 00:39:33.355]  The majority of them healthy young adults.
[00:39:33.976 --> 00:39:37.259]  The pandemic also had a deadly effect on economies.
[00:39:37.499 --> 00:39:38.520]  You can see the agenda.
[00:39:40.962 --> 00:39:50.507]  Just naked law, naked control agenda written down and it's anybody's guess how this becomes effectuated in real life.
[00:39:50.647 --> 00:40:02.613]  So whether this is written specifically as marching orders or whether people take it upon themselves in the intelligence networks to say okay well this has been produced so this is the plan here but these
[00:40:02.773 --> 00:40:04.695]  Narratives have to be written in advance.
[00:40:05.196 --> 00:40:07.698]  The pandemic also had a deadly effect on economics.
[00:40:07.878 --> 00:40:12.063]  International mobility of both people and goods screeched to a halt.
[00:40:12.804 --> 00:40:13.745]  Which is what they want.
[00:40:14.085 --> 00:40:16.408]  They want a completely isolated world.
[00:40:16.548 --> 00:40:21.713]  Debilitating industries like tourism and breaking global supply chains.
[00:40:21.894 --> 00:40:24.797]  And they want you at home, in your house, in front of the TV.
[00:40:25.197 --> 00:40:28.838]  Then they gotcha, because once you watch the TV, they own your soul.
[00:40:29.138 --> 00:40:33.799]  Even locally, normally bustling shops and offices sat empty for months, okay?
[00:40:33.859 --> 00:40:36.100]  So I love how they talk about it in the past tense, in 2010.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:41.462]  That originally aired from the New Manhattan Project in 2014.
[00:40:43.362 --> 00:40:49.144]  They set up globalism to globally enslave us and kill the real international globalism that existed.
[00:40:49.906 --> 00:40:52.247]  Remember, they run the environmental movement to destroy the earth.
[00:40:53.008 --> 00:40:55.630]  They run globalism to destroy real internationalism.
[00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:57.231]  Understand?
[00:40:59.412 --> 00:41:00.793]  It's a big plan and we ain't in it.
[00:41:01.213 --> 00:41:06.656]  Here's a few minutes, though, of Bill Burr, the comedian, up there saying, let's depopulate people on his Netflix special.
[00:41:06.836 --> 00:41:07.297]  Here it is.
[00:41:07.317 --> 00:41:10.219]  What the hell have I been doing with my life?
[00:41:10.279 --> 00:41:11.279]  Trying to get in shape, man.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.222]  I hate going to the gym, so I decided I'd go veggie twice a week.
[00:41:15.782 --> 00:41:16.302]  It's brutal.
[00:41:16.883 --> 00:41:18.724]  I can only make it till about 5 o'clock.
[00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.272]  Five o'clock, that's what I realized about myself.
[00:41:22.652 --> 00:41:23.032]  You know that?
[00:41:23.693 --> 00:41:28.797]  Something has to die every day in order for me to live.
[00:41:30.658 --> 00:41:39.465]  Something's got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive.
[00:41:39.486 --> 00:41:39.986]  I'm trying!
[00:41:41.207 --> 00:41:42.608]  Coos coos and all that sh**.
[00:41:48.753 --> 00:41:49.374]  It's awful.
[00:41:50.515 --> 00:41:53.317]  I saw this thing though, they said if everybody went vegan.
[00:41:54.017 --> 00:41:58.140]  If everybody went vegan though, it would be a vegetarian, whatever the hell they said, one of those V1s, right?
[00:41:59.281 --> 00:42:01.622]  And they said it would be great for the environment.
[00:42:02.363 --> 00:42:08.687]  You know, because I guess there's all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something.
[00:42:08.707 --> 00:42:10.228]  Right?
[00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:13.230]  They're always doing that sh**.
[00:42:14.445 --> 00:42:24.571]  You know, if everybody went vegan, the air would be... If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on... Right?
[00:42:24.851 --> 00:42:26.412]  They just won't come out and say it.
[00:42:27.373 --> 00:42:32.496]  Nobody has the balls to come out and say it and just say, look, 85% of you have to go.
[00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.557]  That's it.
[00:42:36.138 --> 00:42:37.879]  That is it.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:43.403]  I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:45.820]  Alright, we're going to take a break.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.342]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to play more of this.
[00:42:48.382 --> 00:42:52.924]  Then I'm going to get into the latest on the COVID hoax takeover and exactly where it's leading and what they're going to do to you and your family.
[00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:56.966]  And they're coming, they're going to shoot you up, and you're never going to have kids again, and you're going to get cancer and die.
[00:42:57.586 --> 00:43:00.008]  And they're going to have liability protection, and Bill Gates is going to laugh about it.
[00:43:00.448 --> 00:43:01.889]  And by the way, Bill Gates is all over the news.
[00:43:01.929 --> 00:43:07.351]  He's come back out of hiding like a moray eel, saying he's not involved with the vaccines.
[00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:09.172]  He's not involved with implantable chips.
[00:43:09.793 --> 00:43:11.974]  He's not involved, of course, but then he's rolling it all out.
[00:43:13.074 --> 00:43:14.155]  And he's funding the implantable
[00:43:15.083 --> 00:43:15.403]  Tips.
[00:43:16.963 --> 00:43:18.904]  So it's more of the gas lighting they engage in.
[00:43:20.084 --> 00:43:35.007]  Please don't forget that the big special Back to Work, Back to School, Reopen America special, double Patriot points and 50 to 60% off all the high quality supplements and the Alexa Pure Breeze 4-stage ion filter at cost at $137.
[00:43:35.728 --> 00:43:37.308]  That's all going to end this Sunday.
[00:43:38.542 --> 00:43:40.284]  All going to end this Sunday.
[00:43:40.404 --> 00:43:51.753]  Also, the pocket pockets we've sold out, the little privacy pockets we've sold out of all the black ones, and it's back order, but we've got them in other three colors so you can protect your phone and not be tracked by the Globalist.
[00:43:51.933 --> 00:43:55.537]  Those are available at InfoWareStore.com as well, but they're selling out quick.
[00:43:56.718 --> 00:44:01.462]  We're now into hour number two on this live Thursday transmission.
[00:44:02.577 --> 00:44:13.907]  I was spending a lot of time on Event 201 in Lockstep, where the Rockefeller Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, admit they're bringing in world government, authoritarianism, the end of an open, free society.
[00:44:14.388 --> 00:44:15.949]  Now, I think Bill Burr is a good comedian.
[00:44:16.009 --> 00:44:21.334]  He's against cancel culture, and he's got courage to come out and criticize it in this landscape of cowards.
[00:44:21.374 --> 00:44:25.078]  I mean, in a world of cowards, a person with any courage is a hero.
[00:44:26.383 --> 00:44:27.203]  That's a scary thing.
[00:44:27.984 --> 00:44:29.765]  And when the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:44:30.305 --> 00:44:33.347]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:44:33.947 --> 00:44:40.150]  But he did this whole special on Netflix, and he got into depopulation, and he said, let's just say what we want.
[00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.191]  We need to depopulate the Earth.
[00:44:43.632 --> 00:44:49.775]  Some areas are overpopulated, some places have taken up the resources, but most areas are not, and you could sustain this population.
[00:44:50.135 --> 00:44:50.896]  If you remove
[00:44:51.863 --> 00:45:00.030]  Having 2.1% replacement rate for every two adults, 2.1 kids on average, society collapses unless you get rid of a human future.
[00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:11.879]  And that's what's happening right now is a globalist reclamation project to sabotage civilization and destroy the real carrying capacity of the Earth, have those that implement the crisis ride in as the planetary rulers and the saviors.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.281]  Here's what the comedian had to say.
[00:45:13.301 --> 00:45:16.323]  Come out and say it and just say, look, 85% of you have to go.
[00:45:16.363 --> 00:45:16.643]  That's it!
[00:45:21.411 --> 00:45:22.152]  That's a U.N.
[00:45:22.192 --> 00:45:23.172]  number, by the way.
[00:45:23.512 --> 00:45:37.562]  I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row, waiting for some politician to stab the balls to bring it up, but they won't do it.
[00:45:38.022 --> 00:45:38.663]  They won't do it.
[00:45:38.683 --> 00:45:39.523]  We live in a democracy.
[00:45:39.543 --> 00:45:41.725]  So they see themselves as the elites.
[00:45:41.745 --> 00:45:41.845]  Right?
[00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:43.666]  You can't be honest with democracy.
[00:45:43.686 --> 00:45:44.367]  You need the votes.
[00:45:45.587 --> 00:45:47.589]  You can't run with that as your platform.
[00:45:48.567 --> 00:45:50.288]  Oh, but let's take vaccines to save people.
[00:45:50.308 --> 00:45:57.654]  If elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you.
[00:45:57.954 --> 00:45:58.754]  That's COVID-19.
[00:46:00.135 --> 00:46:03.257]  This planet cannot sustain the shared numbers.
[00:46:03.298 --> 00:46:04.038]  Let me finish!
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.462]  This will not be arbitrary.
[00:46:10.202 --> 00:46:13.245]  Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire.
[00:46:13.265 --> 00:46:16.527]  If you did not bring a pencil, you're already out!
[00:46:18.164 --> 00:46:18.985]  Oh, but Bill isn't.
[00:46:19.825 --> 00:46:20.546]  Can't do that.
[00:46:20.966 --> 00:46:23.448]  You gotta be nice.
[00:46:24.129 --> 00:46:25.009]  You gotta be f***ing nice.
[00:46:25.029 --> 00:46:26.090]  Especially this day and age, man.
[00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:27.351]  Everybody getting in trouble.
[00:46:28.052 --> 00:46:29.573]  All these f***ing groups out there.
[00:46:30.073 --> 00:46:32.815]  Bitch-moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything.
[00:46:32.855 --> 00:46:33.296]  You gotta apologize.
[00:46:37.193 --> 00:46:40.316]  I'm sorry to people who own Sharpies.
[00:46:41.277 --> 00:46:44.380]  I didn't mean to say that it's an ugly-ass dog.
[00:46:45.321 --> 00:46:48.784]  I notice they're all willing to kill everybody, but not themselves.
[00:46:49.044 --> 00:46:52.468]  But they're mad about what you say.
[00:46:52.908 --> 00:46:56.571]  They want to silence you so you can be taken out.
[00:46:57.192 --> 00:47:00.235]  And the very people that want to force-inoculate you are the ones that want to kill you.
[00:47:03.103 --> 00:47:04.104]  I'm gonna join a group.
[00:47:04.124 --> 00:47:05.284]  That's what I'm gonna do today.
[00:47:05.985 --> 00:47:06.725]  Go to meetings.
[00:47:06.745 --> 00:47:08.687]  I'm kind of a f***ing loser.
[00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:21.475]  That's the same way I look at people laugh who got, uh, got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player, kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted.
[00:47:21.936 --> 00:47:23.737]  Everybody bitch-moaning.
[00:47:23.757 --> 00:47:24.257]  You know what?
[00:47:24.297 --> 00:47:25.878]  That's what you get for watching the draft.
[00:47:26.539 --> 00:47:28.660]  Once again, what kind of a f***ing loser
[00:47:42.343 --> 00:47:49.667]  So they're all sitting there, you know, that was just out six months ago, and now they're not allowed to go to hear another human talk because the clampdown's here.
[00:47:50.007 --> 00:47:51.648]  Oh, you're like, yay, kill everybody.
[00:47:51.748 --> 00:47:52.788]  Oh, well, we're starting it.
[00:47:53.629 --> 00:47:56.190]  We're making you obsolete right now, getting rid of the infrastructure for you.
[00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.591]  Worldwide depression, hundreds of millions are going to starve to death.
[00:47:59.051 --> 00:47:59.131]  Woo!
[00:48:01.519 --> 00:48:04.904]  But don't worry, you're getting free checks that first six months, that first year.
[00:48:05.765 --> 00:48:06.385]  Some of you are.
[00:48:07.106 --> 00:48:08.729]  The middle class is, not the poor people.
[00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:13.975]  Oh no, they're all having to move in with mama, but mama don't have money no more.
[00:48:14.015 --> 00:48:16.238]  So, oh, there's going to be more homeless.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.622]  Oh, the collapse is here.
[00:48:19.813 --> 00:48:31.767]  And so a sick part of me is all these 60-something millions of babies we've killed, nobody came to their help, so all these yuppies and trendies want to live in a dystopic new world order and get exterminated?
[00:48:32.148 --> 00:48:33.309]  Well, line on up!
[00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.291]  But you know, the leftists are in on it.
[00:48:35.311 --> 00:48:36.633]  They're not going to take the inoculations.
[00:48:36.653 --> 00:48:37.594]  They want us to.
[00:48:38.575 --> 00:48:39.597]  Oh, yes, they do.
[00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:46.402]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[00:48:47.183 --> 00:48:48.564]  Because it leads to the future.
[00:48:49.344 --> 00:48:51.646]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[00:48:52.786 --> 00:48:53.887]  This is not a new world.
[00:48:55.048 --> 00:48:58.330]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:06.895]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[00:49:07.867 --> 00:49:14.791]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:20.554]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[00:49:21.654 --> 00:49:23.936]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:49:29.238 --> 00:49:31.079]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:32.980]  In his last 48 hours on Earth,
[00:49:34.656 --> 00:49:37.617]  He's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[00:49:38.617 --> 00:49:40.197]  Because he is built out of flesh.
[00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:42.218]  And because he has a mind.
[00:49:43.398 --> 00:49:56.101]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[00:49:57.302 --> 00:49:59.582]  You are non-essential!
[00:50:00.822 --> 00:50:02.863]  You are obsolete!
[00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.192]  Yes, you're in a world that didn't need to be, but is.
[00:50:08.992 --> 00:50:13.114]  A planetary world government run by the corporate fascist U.N.
[00:50:14.055 --> 00:50:19.418]  with its big train satanic guerrilla China making its move against humanity.
[00:50:20.438 --> 00:50:26.722]  And the average Westerner is drunk on the fumes of liberty and wealth left in the gas tank.
[00:50:29.083 --> 00:50:31.664]  But soon the engine will stall.
[00:50:33.005 --> 00:50:34.566]  Soon the cities will burn.
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.902]  Soon the prosperity will be gone.
[00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:45.669]  And the rise of the robots will be here.
[00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.353]  And the end of the age of man will dawn.
[00:50:54.797 --> 00:51:00.103]  And because you will not fight, you will die!
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.961]  At all the big sporting events, they have the robots dancing.
[00:51:08.921 --> 00:51:09.741]  No humans!
[00:51:09.961 --> 00:51:11.101]  But we are here!
[00:51:12.322 --> 00:51:13.482]  We will control them.
[00:51:13.562 --> 00:51:14.462]  We will boss them.
[00:51:14.782 --> 00:51:19.283]  We will corral them into the dustbin of history!
[00:51:20.443 --> 00:51:24.244]  It wasn't tanks and foreign armies that could conquer humans.
[00:51:25.444 --> 00:51:26.685]  Not the frontal assault.
[00:51:28.105 --> 00:51:32.626]  It was the opiates of entertainment and decadence.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:44.867]  They couldn't defeat men, so by their dark alchemy, they turned us into narcissistic, sociopathic, arrogant, selfish animals.
[00:51:46.148 --> 00:51:49.010]  Too arrogant to even save ourselves.
[00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:53.713]  Too selfish to even admit the peril that we were all under.
[00:51:55.294 --> 00:52:04.020]  Too committed to the church of Satan to stand up and take God's hand and be lifted into the stars.
[00:52:07.162 --> 00:52:08.623]  Because you didn't want to be angels.
[00:52:10.204 --> 00:52:11.045]  You wanted to fall.
[00:52:13.306 --> 00:52:15.327]  And fall you have, and fall I have.
[00:52:15.427 --> 00:52:27.115]  But out of this nightmare, it will become so painful and all the convenience will be gone, that you will later beg on your knees to God that you'd have done something when you could.
[00:52:28.956 --> 00:52:34.200]  I don't raise this because it was the top story on Twitter and still in the top ten trends this morning when I checked it.
[00:52:35.649 --> 00:52:41.091]  I cover it because it's an illustration of incredible deception and a great teaching tool for myself and others.
[00:52:43.371 --> 00:53:00.597]  From Australia to Germany, from Mexico to the United States, from South Africa to Japan, from the United Kingdom to Libya.
[00:53:03.675 --> 00:53:05.376]  Six foot is being enforced.
[00:53:05.436 --> 00:53:06.417]  Masks are being enforced.
[00:53:06.957 --> 00:53:08.738]  And now we're told children must live in bubbles.
[00:53:10.099 --> 00:53:10.940]  And you must be tracked.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.700]  You must be traced.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.921]  You must take inoculations.
[00:53:14.642 --> 00:53:16.503]  The United Nations is the only boss.
[00:53:16.543 --> 00:53:17.544]  They tell us what we can do.
[00:53:18.944 --> 00:53:25.689]  And Bill Gates admits COVID-19 is a giant Event 201 drill for a real bioweapon that will be released soon.
[00:53:26.989 --> 00:53:28.150]  We've behaved so well.
[00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:29.051]  We've done what we're told.
[00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:30.872]  We've proven we'll submit.
[00:53:32.637 --> 00:53:56.632]  And now the medical system has put fraudulent numbers of millions that died of other things in the COVID column, and we've followed orders to kill old people in the nursing homes, and the censorship's worked so well to shut down now thousands of doctors and scientists and medical workers that try to speak out, that now they're going to totally destroy the economy, and they're going to release bioweapons that are really deadly, and they're going to kill you.
[00:53:56.653 --> 00:54:00.655]  Because Bill Gates said there's too many of you, and the U.N.
[00:54:00.675 --> 00:54:01.576]  said there's too many of you.
[00:54:02.423 --> 00:54:05.124]  And Bill Burr went at his specials and said we need to kill 85%!
[00:54:05.765 --> 00:54:07.085]  And the big audience goes, kill us!
[00:54:07.725 --> 00:54:13.388]  Just like at TED Talk, Bill Gates said eight, nine years ago, he said we're going to reduce world population by 80%.
[00:54:13.988 --> 00:54:17.150]  We're going to lower the number of humans that we're having to zero.
[00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:19.771]  And everybody, standing ovation!
[00:54:23.684 --> 00:54:27.913]  Oh, but he doesn't want you to die, so he's got a vaccine for you.
[00:54:27.933 --> 00:54:34.346]  And he's spending billions to do it of tax-free money he's given by the Ford, Carnegie, and Rockefeller foundations.
[00:54:39.838 --> 00:54:41.059]  That's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:54:41.659 --> 00:54:43.039]  He wants to depopulate you.
[00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.540]  His father ran Planned Parenthood.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.481]  He's on record saying he wants to depopulate Africa.
[00:54:48.082 --> 00:54:51.363]  But he wants you to have a shot so you don't get sick.
[00:54:52.023 --> 00:54:53.464]  But he admits it doesn't really help you.
[00:54:53.504 --> 00:54:54.484]  It's going to hurt a lot of people.
[00:54:54.804 --> 00:55:05.269]  And it does tend to reduce fertility, but... And the average black person, white person, you name it, that thinks they're middle class will say, well, there are too many people.
[00:55:06.664 --> 00:55:10.085]  Well, then blow your head off, slit your wrist, jump off a cliff.
[00:55:10.485 --> 00:55:12.325]  Just don't take anybody with you when you do it.
[00:55:13.226 --> 00:55:17.307]  Seriously, if you want to kill everybody else, be a good teacher.
[00:55:18.567 --> 00:55:20.868]  And you know the best way to teach people is by example.
[00:55:22.868 --> 00:55:24.048]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:55:24.408 --> 00:55:30.590]  Bill Gates is far too precious to ever harm a little hair on his chinny-chin-chin.
[00:55:32.451 --> 00:55:33.831]  He wants you to die.
[00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:43.358]  Well he wants to do it where you die in five or six or ten years with the little goodies he's got in four of the vaccines he's funding that aren't even vaccines.
[00:55:43.698 --> 00:55:55.048]  I mean if I had a 357 Magnum and I put the shells in it and I put it to your head and I said it's a vaccine and I pull the trigger and blew your head off, well it'd be okay because it's a vaccine.
[00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.591]  You know, if I took a hatchet and put it in your face,
[00:55:59.565 --> 00:56:00.485]  Just a random person.
[00:56:00.725 --> 00:56:01.446]  I said, it's a vaccine.
[00:56:01.706 --> 00:56:13.770]  You know, a vaccine, learned immunity goes back, you know, thousands of years, where people figured out you could take the pus from a cow that had a different disease, like smallpox, and you could jam it in somebody's arm and give it to them.
[00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:15.791]  And once they'd had it, they wouldn't get it again.
[00:56:16.551 --> 00:56:18.292]  But sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.
[00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:21.700]  But the thought was if you give it to somebody when they're not run down.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.542]  Somebody used to die in the winter from smallpox because they weren't getting vitamin D3 from the sun.
[00:56:25.862 --> 00:56:26.602]  They didn't know why.
[00:56:26.642 --> 00:56:31.724]  They just knew they had thought vapors were in the cold and that's why they said, you know, wear lots of clothing because the cold gives it to you.
[00:56:31.764 --> 00:56:32.725]  No, it's the lack of sunlight.
[00:56:34.385 --> 00:56:36.106]  But they knew cold and damp gave it to you.
[00:56:37.547 --> 00:56:39.327]  And so they take a little toothpick.
[00:56:40.368 --> 00:56:44.930]  First examples of this are about 500 years ago, got written down 500 years ago because they didn't have printing presses until then.
[00:56:46.394 --> 00:56:48.295]  And they just stick it in your arm and you get a little scar.
[00:56:48.356 --> 00:56:49.837]  And if you do it in the summer, they just knew.
[00:56:49.877 --> 00:56:55.161]  The doctors were like, the apothecaries, the witch doctors, the local surgeons, the barbers.
[00:56:55.221 --> 00:56:55.861]  Barbers would do it.
[00:56:56.242 --> 00:57:00.024]  That's why the barber pull is the blue, the white, the red.
[00:57:00.044 --> 00:57:01.606]  Usually they're just red and white.
[00:57:01.986 --> 00:57:03.427]  Red's the blood, white's the bandages.
[00:57:03.807 --> 00:57:04.728]  Barbers pulled teeth.
[00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:06.149]  Barbers did inoculations.
[00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:08.050]  Barbers did surgeries.
[00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:12.134]  Depending on how good a barber you were, they were usually close to a drugstore called an apothecary.
[00:57:12.918 --> 00:57:16.859]  You'd go there and that's what that symbol of a drugstore is a grinder, a bowl and a grinder.
[00:57:18.059 --> 00:57:21.080]  And they have, you know, vitamins and minerals and things in there that really worked.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.841]  Big pharma just came in and took all that over and then, you know, now it says get rid of the old thing.
[00:57:25.861 --> 00:57:27.881]  But some was good in the old, some was bad.
[00:57:28.462 --> 00:57:32.222]  It's like Chinese medicine is very, ancient Chinese medicine is very similar to ancient Western medicine.
[00:57:32.242 --> 00:57:37.104]  But the old days, the Catholic Church would burn you at the stake if you were gathering herbs and things.
[00:57:37.124 --> 00:57:38.444]  That was seen as witchcraft.
[00:57:39.534 --> 00:57:40.595]  Because knowledge is evil, right?
[00:57:40.835 --> 00:57:42.356]  We see today, knowledge is witchcraft.
[00:57:42.416 --> 00:57:46.538]  I mean, they say we tell people vitamin D3 is essential not to get COVID-19, they'll arrest you.
[00:57:47.479 --> 00:57:49.520]  If medical doctors prescribe it, they'll send a SWAT team.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.422]  Medical doctors give you vitamin C in Michigan, they SWAT team you.
[00:57:53.122 --> 00:57:55.223]  Because the UN says none of that helps.
[00:57:55.644 --> 00:57:57.525]  Doesn't matter, the NIH website says it does.
[00:57:57.725 --> 00:57:58.865]  The UN is boss.
[00:57:59.646 --> 00:58:00.546]  But I digress.
[00:58:03.588 --> 00:58:06.370]  We're now under the United Nations control.
[00:58:08.476 --> 00:58:14.481]  And complying with all this is only going to intensify how bad the civilization gets.
[00:58:16.002 --> 00:58:26.610]  So when I come back, I'm going to run through this exercise they engaged in to take what I did and totally twist it and make it the number one thing on the internet.
[00:58:30.093 --> 00:58:31.594]  And so understanding this, you'll understand it all.
[00:58:31.614 --> 00:58:33.615]  Look at the latest COVID takeover.
[00:58:33.835 --> 00:58:35.917]  It's a permanent post-human takeover.
[00:58:35.937 --> 00:58:36.998]  When they're done, you'll all be dead.
[00:58:38.524 --> 00:58:40.265]  You're not supposed to be hearing this broadcast.
[00:58:40.285 --> 00:58:41.386]  It's supposed to be off the air.
[00:58:42.507 --> 00:58:45.649]  But thanks to you spreading the word, it's more important than it's ever been.
[00:58:45.669 --> 00:58:56.338]  I'm going to cover the waterfront on news next segment, all the big campaign news, economy news, plans to try to have Democrat states secede and challenge the election.
[00:58:56.418 --> 00:58:59.300]  I mean, that's the waters we're in with 81 Days Out.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:00.501]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:01.081 --> 00:59:03.583]  But first, let's just get into the anatomy of a hoax.
[00:59:05.324 --> 00:59:07.126]  Middle of the show, the boom operator,
[00:59:08.413 --> 00:59:15.039]  John, over there, says, hey, you're number one on Twitter.
[00:59:17.942 --> 00:59:25.610]  And during the break, I go look at it, and it's a one-minute clip, edited out of context, and they say, look, he's randomly just screaming at teenagers for no reason.
[00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:26.250]  He's insane.
[00:59:28.152 --> 00:59:29.113]  And it gave no context.
[00:59:29.213 --> 00:59:32.496]  Not, oh, there's these giant city parks.
[00:59:33.527 --> 00:59:35.588]  Where you don't even see anyone because they're so huge.
[00:59:35.989 --> 00:59:36.769]  Called Greenbelts.
[00:59:36.809 --> 00:59:37.850]  They're as big as state parks.
[00:59:38.531 --> 00:59:44.175]  And there's just entrances in the woods off of neighborhoods where people have been going, where I've been going since high school.
[00:59:45.616 --> 00:59:46.636]  And they're there blocking it.
[00:59:46.696 --> 00:59:49.638]  So the one my wife goes to, the one I go to, she went with a friend.
[00:59:49.678 --> 00:59:50.239]  She comes in.
[00:59:51.079 --> 00:59:52.160]  I've already cooked breakfast for the kids.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.942]  I'm sitting there and she's like, man, they like saw me and said, get out of here.
[00:59:54.962 --> 00:59:55.703]  And were really rude.
[00:59:57.124 --> 00:59:58.225]  And said, you got to register.
[00:59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.526]  And they've got like a stupid plastic front up there.
[01:00:00.586 --> 01:00:02.768]  And it's just ridiculous in the woods.
[01:00:04.653 --> 01:00:07.916]  So I go over there, and they say, hey, you can't go in there.
[01:00:07.956 --> 01:00:08.776]  You've got to be registered.
[01:00:08.957 --> 01:00:11.839]  And I already saw them turning people away, saying it was full, total lie.
[01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:15.222]  Wouldn't even let them, quote, register with the COVID tracing.
[01:00:18.084 --> 01:00:20.506]  So they edit that down.
[01:00:20.586 --> 01:00:21.967]  The station puts out a fake article.
[01:00:21.987 --> 01:00:25.110]  A couple of people came to my table at a restaurant and said, we're going to kill you.
[01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:26.831]  We're going to get you.
[01:00:27.372 --> 01:00:28.513]  They're waiting for me outside.
[01:00:28.633 --> 01:00:29.474]  I yell back at them.
[01:00:29.674 --> 01:00:33.117]  They shoot video of it, put it on Reddit, and say, Jones just attacked us for no reason.
[01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:35.620]  I said they came to my table, threatened me.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.180]  I called the manager multiple times.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:37.900]  They did it three times.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:43.922]  Statesman, to their credit, Jonathan Cholub, I've never seen mainstream media tell the truth ever in like five years.
[01:00:43.962 --> 01:00:44.302]  He did it.
[01:00:44.702 --> 01:00:47.263]  He hates me, but he said, no, I went to the restaurant.
[01:00:47.303 --> 01:00:49.504]  They said that he complained they were coming to his table, threatening him.
[01:00:50.124 --> 01:00:50.864]  So that's what they do.
[01:00:50.924 --> 01:00:51.685]  F you and your family.
[01:00:51.705 --> 01:00:52.645]  You're going to effing die.
[01:00:52.665 --> 01:00:53.425]  I hope you die.
[01:00:53.545 --> 01:00:54.085]  Hope you eat.
[01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:54.666]  You know what?
[01:00:56.946 --> 01:00:57.406]  I'm leaving.
[01:00:57.426 --> 01:00:58.327]  They're waiting for me.
[01:00:58.467 --> 01:00:59.027]  Okay.
[01:00:59.427 --> 01:01:00.527]  I don't, yeah, I yell at them.
[01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:02.148]  That turns into,
[01:01:05.874 --> 01:01:06.675]  Alex Jones is bad.
[01:01:08.096 --> 01:01:10.698]  So that's how these Decepticons operate.
[01:01:11.819 --> 01:01:20.988]  And so they trended, number one on Twitter, that I just yelled at random people.
[01:01:21.048 --> 01:01:22.209]  No, you hear them on the tape.
[01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:25.632]  So they knew when they edited this, they go, hey, you don't have a pass, you can't be in here.
[01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:28.891]  And they just cut to me like five minutes later, yelling at him.
[01:01:29.111 --> 01:01:29.991]  I was there for an hour.
[01:01:30.331 --> 01:01:31.791]  The police came and said, he's right.
[01:01:32.512 --> 01:01:38.693]  They ordered the lifeguards to stop blocking the entrance and they said, there is no law, we've checked, you can't do it.
[01:01:38.874 --> 01:01:39.574]  That's huge!
[01:01:40.814 --> 01:01:41.934]  Nowhere is that there.
[01:01:42.194 --> 01:01:44.175]  That the families, they could go in.
[01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:47.936]  Where they've been coming for decades.
[01:01:48.316 --> 01:01:49.557]  So that's the level.
[01:01:49.577 --> 01:01:53.198]  Now there I am, high-fiving the family after the police say, now you can go in.
[01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:54.358]  And look, the police have,
[01:01:55.694 --> 01:02:00.117]  The teenagers across the street where they ordered him, they said, get out of there, stop doing it.
[01:02:00.538 --> 01:02:03.039]  Then more lifeguards showed up and the police said, stop doing it.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:04.620]  You can't do it.
[01:02:04.641 --> 01:02:05.381]  There's no ordinance.
[01:02:05.641 --> 01:02:06.562]  No law's been passed.
[01:02:06.882 --> 01:02:07.603]  This is wrong.
[01:02:09.724 --> 01:02:19.351]  It turns into Jones is a bully bullying college students who are flipping us off.
[01:02:20.452 --> 01:02:22.694]  But that's how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:23.732 --> 01:02:26.874]  They laughed at me, they told me F off when I'd been there a few minutes.
[01:02:26.975 --> 01:02:28.095]  That's when I started yelling at them.
[01:02:29.837 --> 01:02:31.578]  But the left are deceivers.
[01:02:32.118 --> 01:02:34.040]  And as a group, they deceive.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.741]  It's who they are.
[01:02:36.522 --> 01:02:37.723]  Fraud is their M.O.
[01:02:38.744 --> 01:02:39.464]  But it got worse.
[01:02:40.265 --> 01:02:42.647]  By afternoon, I guess they decided, well this isn't good.
[01:02:43.067 --> 01:02:44.968]  Just one version of the video has 8 million views.
[01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:46.730]  It's like 15 million views right now.
[01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:48.611]  People found the real version.
[01:02:50.132 --> 01:02:50.513]  And so...
[01:02:52.779 --> 01:02:53.319]  What did they do?
[01:02:53.339 --> 01:02:54.580]  Look at these headlines.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:06.023]  When hashtag Alex Jones does a stick at the local park, and it trends more than hashtag Biden-Harris 2020 landslide.
[01:03:08.724 --> 01:03:09.564]  So how did they respond?
[01:03:09.664 --> 01:03:10.004]  Boom!
[01:03:10.084 --> 01:03:14.845]  Child porn found on documents Alex Jones sent to lawyers of Senate Families Court filing sets.
[01:03:16.046 --> 01:03:20.647]  They boosted this to the top of Twitter, above the video, so we get hundreds of thousands of views.
[01:03:22.912 --> 01:03:35.709]  But people began to actually read the article where the FBI said it was unopened emails we've been sent years ago that they requested in a deposition in Discovery and that we were the victim.
[01:03:35.869 --> 01:03:38.933]  But the headline still makes me look bad, but in the article it admits we were the victims.
[01:03:39.233 --> 01:03:40.215]  So that's the left again.
[01:03:42.059 --> 01:03:50.762]  Covering up real pedophilia, sexualization of children, drag queen pervert story time, but Alex Jones that leads a crusade against it, he is a child porn person.
[01:03:51.382 --> 01:03:54.403]  Who would send it to the families of the Sandy Hook people.
[01:03:54.823 --> 01:03:55.303]  All lies.
[01:03:58.144 --> 01:03:59.064]  So, look.
[01:04:01.965 --> 01:04:05.306]  Here it is, headline, Jones just being mean to random women.
[01:04:08.086 --> 01:04:10.687]  No, she was laughing at me saying, you're a joke, you can't come in.
[01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:13.548]  She got there after the other lifeguards were thrown out by the police!
[01:04:17.229 --> 01:04:26.813]  It's just the Barton Springs is a small creek that's spring-fed up by the main creek that's been there forever and that they charge you a couple dollars to go into.
[01:04:27.393 --> 01:04:29.134]  Now that's basically closed to the public.
[01:04:29.454 --> 01:04:37.257]  So what they do is they just seize the entire Barton Creek and the huge greenbelt saying it's theirs.
[01:04:40.472 --> 01:04:45.394]  And instead of thousands going down there, that's hundreds of square miles, no one can.
[01:04:46.374 --> 01:04:48.915]  And so Alex Jones going to stand up for families' rights.
[01:04:49.495 --> 01:04:51.096]  So I sat there and watched families walk up.
[01:04:51.516 --> 01:04:52.456]  Hey, I've always come here.
[01:04:52.516 --> 01:04:54.077]  Well, sorry, registration.
[01:04:54.137 --> 01:04:54.937]  Okay, can I register?
[01:04:55.217 --> 01:04:56.358]  No, sorry, it's full.
[01:04:57.858 --> 01:05:01.059]  Little smart-ass, snot-nosed, scummy.
[01:05:01.079 --> 01:05:05.541]  I mean, I sat there for 30 minutes in my truck watching them.
[01:05:06.425 --> 01:05:21.029]  Because you can't normally park right up at it, but there was nobody being let in, so I could pull right up, and I'm sitting there, 20 yards away, window down on my truck, watching them stand behind the green makeshift counter they put up with plexiglass, going, stay back, COVID!
[01:05:21.089 --> 01:05:22.470]  They even told me, stay back, COVID!
[01:05:24.485 --> 01:05:33.974]  And I watched the families and so I got out by like the 10th family I saw turned back and I said, uh, sir, there's no ordinance I've checked and I'm about to go up here and confront him.
[01:05:34.394 --> 01:05:35.255]  I said, watch what happens.
[01:05:35.415 --> 01:05:36.676]  So the guy sat there and watched me.
[01:05:36.716 --> 01:05:37.157]  He waited.
[01:05:37.417 --> 01:05:38.598]  Cops came an hour later.
[01:05:38.618 --> 01:05:39.799]  They said, yes, sir, you can go in.
[01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:40.580]  There's no law.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.321]  It's unenforceable.
[01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:42.622]  And he high-fived me and went in.
[01:05:42.922 --> 01:05:48.187]  But see, how do you take something like that, that if everybody started doing it, we would be out of this problem overnight?
[01:05:48.767 --> 01:05:50.209]  Civil disobedience, nonviolent.
[01:05:52.304 --> 01:05:55.527]  I could have been nicer, but they were flipping me off and smart mouths.
[01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:57.969]  And man, I'm tired of this, man.
[01:05:58.689 --> 01:06:02.432]  I have been taking girls down to that green belt since I was seven.
[01:06:02.852 --> 01:06:03.753]  That very entrance.
[01:06:04.674 --> 01:06:06.936]  I've been going to the green belt since I was two years old.
[01:06:06.976 --> 01:06:08.097]  We visited grandma down here.
[01:06:08.277 --> 01:06:10.238]  I'm from Dallas, but I've been here since high school.
[01:06:10.539 --> 01:06:12.180]  I've been going to that green belt since high school.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.963]  I've been going in that entrance since college.
[01:06:17.967 --> 01:06:20.328]  I've probably taken 20 dates down there.
[01:06:20.508 --> 01:06:23.189]  I've had great picnics, great fishing, great hiking.
[01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:26.250]  Most days I go down there, no one's even there.
[01:06:26.511 --> 01:06:32.993]  And now, permanently, are snot-nosed scum waiting at the entrance for COVID tracing!
[01:06:34.974 --> 01:06:37.715]  And the governor gave hundreds of millions to Google to run it.
[01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:41.457]  And then the evil Twitter takes that.
[01:06:42.662 --> 01:06:45.283]  And lies about me and then says I'm sending people child porn.
[01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:53.426]  That's the scum and the filth of the technocracy and the type of abuse they'll carry out in their corporate evil while they support China with giant death camps.
[01:06:54.566 --> 01:06:55.507]  So that's who we're up against.
[01:06:55.547 --> 01:06:58.648]  These aren't liberal trendies that run Twitter, Facebook and Google.
[01:06:58.668 --> 01:07:10.172]  These are monstrous, hardened war criminals engaged in the takedown of the West and coming with forced inoculations for you and your family and banning doctors from their own free speech in America.
[01:07:11.618 --> 01:07:12.939]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:12.959 --> 01:07:15.301]  I'm going to shift gears into other news here in a moment.
[01:07:16.922 --> 01:07:20.045]  But first off, let me announce some activism we're going to be engaged in.
[01:07:21.206 --> 01:07:26.811]  I told a listener yesterday that I'm going to go out tomorrow from 6 to 8.
[01:07:27.391 --> 01:07:28.772]  We haven't picked a location yet.
[01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:30.534]  I'm thinking it'll be the Capitol.
[01:07:31.895 --> 01:07:32.535]  We'll just pick that.
[01:07:32.555 --> 01:07:37.339]  6 to 8, Friday, at the Capitol, downtown.
[01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:44.965]  Calling it American Flag Drop, where we go out, we support President Trump, we support reopening the country and the nation.
[01:07:44.985 --> 01:07:46.067]  So please come out to that.
[01:07:47.526 --> 01:07:49.327]  That is downtown Austin.
[01:07:49.908 --> 01:07:52.709]  That's Congress and 11th Street.
[01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:59.994]  They've got the Capitol closed because of the COVID hoax, but right in front of it, there's a big steps to the beginning of the Capitol grounds.
[01:08:00.014 --> 01:08:03.876]  And that's a perfect place to have that flag drop that I think should become a nationwide event.
[01:08:04.197 --> 01:08:07.158]  You heard the caller from Chicago talk about how successful it is.
[01:08:07.178 --> 01:08:10.881]  We're gonna be out there with our American flags, Old Glory, Texas flag, you name it.
[01:08:11.241 --> 01:08:12.422]  And that will be tomorrow.
[01:08:13.262 --> 01:08:15.484]  We need to really take action against this.
[01:08:16.946 --> 01:08:25.651]  We need to be able to exercise our will because we're being locked up like prisoners in our houses with an AI grid that's going to control us.
[01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:30.394]  We're being taught we're too toxic to be out in the public, and that we're evil carbon-based life forms.
[01:08:30.434 --> 01:08:37.858]  I've always told you the plan is we're dirty, we're bad, we're evil, we have to be gotten rid of, we're bad for the earth, we're bad for other humans, and that's all this is.
[01:08:37.878 --> 01:08:43.762]  And this is admitted in Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, and it's a dystopia because good people will put up with it.
[01:08:44.841 --> 01:08:51.187]  And because you're not dystopic yourself, so you keep projecting onto it that it's not bad.
[01:08:51.307 --> 01:08:51.968]  It is bad.
[01:08:52.208 --> 01:08:57.373]  And I know the audience gets that, but I'm not saying all this to try to make it sound scarier than it is.
[01:08:57.793 --> 01:09:01.437]  There's not words to describe how diabolical and organized it is.
[01:09:01.897 --> 01:09:05.741]  Anything and everything the globalists promote must be rejected out of hand.
[01:09:07.841 --> 01:09:09.002]  Let's go to this special report.
[01:09:09.502 --> 01:09:12.405]  CNN says Joe Biden to step down for Kamala Harris.
[01:09:12.545 --> 01:09:13.065]  Clip nine.
[01:09:13.526 --> 01:09:17.329]  CNN says Joe Biden to step down for Kamala Harris after election.
[01:09:17.469 --> 01:09:18.430]  It's on Band on video.
[01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:20.431]  Here it is.
[01:09:20.471 --> 01:09:22.313]  This is yet again, dead on.
[01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:32.921]  Over a year ago, we predicted that Joe Biden would simply be a placeholder for whoever he chose as his VP running mate, and that he would then step aside.
[01:09:33.862 --> 01:09:35.944]  CNN is now reporting officially
[01:09:36.284 --> 01:09:44.350]  That that is the plan with Kamala Harris and that he plans to step aside as soon as he gets into office.
[01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:47.112]  She's bought and paid for by big tech.
[01:09:47.592 --> 01:09:52.175]  She's completely empty like Joe Biden and will follow the globalist orders.
[01:09:52.916 --> 01:10:02.743]  It's Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on record that have openly said we should take orders from China and the communist China should dictate every facet of our lives.
[01:10:03.403 --> 01:10:08.291]  America was only a few months away from being completely economically defeated.
[01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:10.073]  Communist China owned our debt.
[01:10:10.414 --> 01:10:15.862]  Hollywood produced almost all of our prescription drugs, manufacturing, and rare earth minerals.
[01:10:16.523 --> 01:10:18.205]  But President Trump got in office.
[01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:27.071]  And now for the last three and a half years, the Deep State, allied with Communist China, has been battling as hard as they can to shut down the U.S.
[01:10:27.111 --> 01:10:30.233]  economy and ensure that we lose the trade war with China.
[01:10:30.614 --> 01:10:36.457]  Months ago, and then again weeks ago, InfoWars was on record predicting Kamala Harris and not Susan Rice.
[01:10:36.938 --> 01:10:38.179]  Susan Rice is a globalist.
[01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:44.403]  Susan Rice hates America, but she's intelligent and she tends to sometimes act on her own.
[01:10:45.123 --> 01:10:47.244]  Establishment does not want that.
[01:10:47.684 --> 01:10:55.185]  They want someone totally bought and paid for, completely fake, totally sociopathic like Kamala Harris, and now they found their woman.
[01:10:55.765 --> 01:11:06.848]  It doesn't matter if she supported Joe Biden when she was in the California government by throwing the book at black Americans and giving them three times the prison sentences of white people with minimum sentencing.
[01:11:07.188 --> 01:11:15.258]  It doesn't matter if she then flip-flopped and called Joe Biden a racist for his busing practices and also for his prison practices.
[01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:21.745]  It doesn't matter that she came out and said, I believe the women that say he assaulted them and they should be heard.
[01:11:22.606 --> 01:11:34.729]  She's totally flip-flopping on all of that now, but that's okay because she's a woman and because she has a little bit of African blood in her, even though her family was one of the biggest plantation owners and slave owners in Jamaica.
[01:11:35.169 --> 01:11:37.069]  You just can't make this up.
[01:11:37.529 --> 01:11:45.911]  So, Trump's here trying to empower the country, trying to turn our industry back on, trying to make fair trade deals, trying to rebuild our military, trying to secure our borders.
[01:11:46.977 --> 01:11:58.905]  And here comes the slave master minion, Kamala Harris, to use the color of her skin as a pretext to further destabilize this country and try to silence any criticism of her and the globalist agenda.
[01:11:59.145 --> 01:12:01.907]  The New World Order control freaks don't just like Kamala Harris.
[01:12:02.087 --> 01:12:04.869]  They love her because she's a rubber stamp for their agenda.
[01:12:05.309 --> 01:12:08.171]  She wants the entire Green Deal that would shut down our economy.
[01:12:08.351 --> 01:12:10.912]  She wants to restrict red meat and ban plastic straws.
[01:12:11.153 --> 01:12:12.533]  She wants to get rid of our oil industry.
[01:12:12.974 --> 01:12:15.856]  This woman is a globalist weapons system.
[01:12:16.616 --> 01:12:27.505]  But most importantly, in the final equation, remember that she's been very honest about her views on the Second Amendment and wants all semi-autos banned and would sign an executive order and have them confiscated.
[01:12:28.025 --> 01:12:35.812]  She believes, as Beto O'Rourke does, that it's time to take all Americans semi-automatic firearms, completing our journey into total slavery.
[01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:50.321]  Well, at the same time, she wants to defund the police and let criminals run wild, but again, tell us we don't have a right to protect ourselves while she is a senator with armed bodyguards and will now have Secret Service protection as the VP pick of Joe Biden.
[01:12:50.641 --> 01:12:51.541]  Hypocrisy.
[01:12:52.002 --> 01:12:52.502]  Fraud.
[01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:53.422]  Deceit.
[01:12:53.823 --> 01:12:54.403]  Corruption.
[01:12:54.743 --> 01:12:55.604]  Two-facedness.
[01:12:56.344 --> 01:12:57.205]  Hatred of America.
[01:12:58.348 --> 01:13:04.031]  Attacks on the family, attacks on males, attacks on everything that makes our country strong.
[01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:10.513]  Kamala Harris was rejected and was only polling at 1% during the Democrat primaries.
[01:13:10.934 --> 01:13:14.775]  Particularly amongst black Americans, they saw the fake fraud she was.
[01:13:15.376 --> 01:13:16.796]  Willie Brown dated her for years.
[01:13:17.156 --> 01:13:20.018]  The mayor of San Francisco says, she's bad news.
[01:13:20.758 --> 01:13:23.559]  He begged Biden, if you're going to pick a black woman, pick a real black woman.
[01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:24.760]  This lady is not trustworthy.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.281]  Her own boyfriend is warning the world.
[01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:41.883]  But again, the establishment believes they can override the people's will, the Democratic Party's will, the populace will, and force these two minions into the White House so the globalists can complete our journey into total collapse.
[01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:46.385]  They are openly saying they're going to challenge the election when Trump wins.
[01:13:46.906 --> 01:13:51.568]  If he challenges their challenge, they're saying he's a dictator and have called the military to overthrow him.
[01:13:52.108 --> 01:13:55.111]  This is all being announced as the official plan.
[01:13:55.692 --> 01:13:58.935]  In the next 80 days, America is fighting for its life.
[01:13:59.555 --> 01:14:11.747]  That's why you, out there watching, need to raise the alarm as the modern Paul Reveres, and by word of mouth, share this report and other reports from Van.Video and fullwords.com forward slash show to override the AI censors.
[01:14:12.128 --> 01:14:15.731]  You've been doing it, and that's why Trump's winning and why a landslide is coming.
[01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:16.412]  But,
[01:14:16.932 --> 01:14:22.936]  Just because a huge red wave is coming in, they're building a huge seawall of election fraud, race war and tearing.
[01:14:23.456 --> 01:14:28.279]  So even though a landslide's coming, their fraud may be able to block it and there's going to be a huge confrontation.
[01:14:28.299 --> 01:14:30.241]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:31.181]  I know you are.
[01:14:32.002 --> 01:14:37.005]  We are living to see America fight for its life and win if we all take action.
[01:14:37.325 --> 01:14:38.526]  God bless and good luck.
[01:14:46.745 --> 01:14:47.946]  And by the way, I'll announce when we come back.
[01:14:48.046 --> 01:14:52.710]  I'm going down there Saturday with American flags, and I'm marching to that green belt.
[01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:53.811]  Nothing's gonna stop me.
[01:14:55.072 --> 01:15:02.018]  All over the world, the United Nations-directed lockdown is going into stage four.
[01:15:02.358 --> 01:15:12.626]  In places like Melbourne, Australia, they are completely locking down entire cities, entire tower blocks for weeks and weeks and months.
[01:15:13.087 --> 01:15:15.689]  And you can't even leave your house, even with a mask on.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:17.620]  And now the U.N.
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:21.721]  says they want to come into your house and take your children.
[01:15:22.681 --> 01:15:24.321]  Now New Zealand is announcing this.
[01:15:24.641 --> 01:15:27.402]  This is all a United Nations power grab.
[01:15:29.222 --> 01:15:39.384]  And so, this Saturday at high noon, I'm going to one of the main Greenbelt Park entrances in Austin, Texas.
[01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:43.545]  If you're coming in from outside town, all you do is put in the Hill of Life.
[01:15:46.637 --> 01:15:50.578]  1710 Camp Kraft Road, Austin, Texas 78746.
[01:15:53.699 --> 01:15:54.439]  Open now!
[01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:57.379]  5 a.m.
[01:15:57.399 --> 01:15:58.139]  to 10 p.m.
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:10.342]  But when you get there, they now have contact tracers there wanting your driver's license, your name, your number for contact tracing, and they're only letting in people
[01:16:11.647 --> 01:16:14.189]  When they first set up their checkpoint.
[01:16:14.289 --> 01:16:16.150]  After that, everyone else is turned back.
[01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:19.052]  I went past the checkpoint, went down, checked it.
[01:16:19.652 --> 01:16:20.573]  No one was there.
[01:16:21.273 --> 01:16:29.338]  Normally at this one entrance, parking on the local streets, you'll have by noon on a Saturday when there's lots of rain and the creek's full, a hundred, two hundred vehicles.
[01:16:29.858 --> 01:16:32.680]  There were six or seven vehicles when I got there.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:38.063]  Most of those were quote, park police, which didn't exist until recently.
[01:16:38.564 --> 01:16:40.345]  They are SJWs.
[01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:43.751]  We've got footage of the old park entrance.
[01:16:44.111 --> 01:16:55.897]  Now they've got a green divider set up with plexiglass for the Kabuki theater that you stand behind when they refuse to let you in to this particular entrance.
[01:16:55.997 --> 01:17:00.279]  It is a quarter of a mile steep grade down and back up.
[01:17:00.999 --> 01:17:03.940]  People like Lance Armstrong, who lives nearby, are routinely on it.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.082]  I've seen him there probably 20 times running up and down in the morning.
[01:17:07.847 --> 01:17:09.528]  That's the type of stuff that's going on there.
[01:17:09.608 --> 01:17:24.976]  At the bottom, you come to Barton Creek, and this footage looks like it was shot a few years ago, because now it's even up higher, and I recognize that area and know the lay of the land and the brush.
[01:17:26.017 --> 01:17:30.119]  So it's very, very pretty, but you can see in this footage that the woman goes down there with her dog.
[01:17:30.359 --> 01:17:31.340]  There's no one there!
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.101]  Because...
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:36.520]  It's several hundred square miles.
[01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:40.021]  And all it is is entrances by people's houses down to it.
[01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:45.442]  Because it's a canyon and they can't build on it, so the city bought it.
[01:17:46.882 --> 01:17:53.243]  Now, Lake Austin, which is just a damn Colorado, dumps into it.
[01:17:54.563 --> 01:17:55.624]  And it dumps into it.
[01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:59.864]  And on the side where people own houses, there's boating and swimming.
[01:18:00.405 --> 01:18:02.485]  But on the side that hits downtown,
[01:18:03.715 --> 01:18:12.803]  They tell you no swimming allowed just in the last decade because they don't want the common slave being able to swim in that beautiful body of water.
[01:18:13.583 --> 01:18:19.949]  Imagine being able to park your car in some areas, walk down a hundred yards and you're on water like that.
[01:18:20.289 --> 01:18:21.270]  Radio listeners are missing it.
[01:18:22.891 --> 01:18:30.318]  And because the city bought for hundreds of millions of dollars, over 20 miles of it,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.665]  In some cases, going out over 1,000 acres on each side, it's incredible.
[01:18:37.785 --> 01:18:38.726]  You can get lost out there.
[01:18:40.687 --> 01:18:41.568]  They don't want you on it.
[01:18:41.588 --> 01:18:47.653]  And again, Paul Watson wrote about this for Summit.News, and on his Twitter article, his Twitter link, people are like, yeah, I'm in Spain.
[01:18:48.033 --> 01:18:48.914]  Yeah, I'm in Australia.
[01:18:48.934 --> 01:18:49.795]  Yeah, I'm in the U.S.
[01:18:50.415 --> 01:18:51.576]  The state parks closed.
[01:18:51.596 --> 01:18:52.697]  The national parks closed.
[01:18:52.877 --> 01:18:56.661]  I mean, they say, oh, it's open, but they're not giving anyone reservations.
[01:18:56.961 --> 01:18:57.922]  They're empty.
[01:19:00.387 --> 01:19:02.868]  Because it's Agenda 21, they don't want anyone there.
[01:19:02.948 --> 01:19:06.209]  So God gave us this planet and gave us this dominion.
[01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:11.291]  And I used to read to people, I was in 21, I was in 2030.
[01:19:11.871 --> 01:19:13.732]  I made a film about it called America's Robot Design in 1997.
[01:19:14.632 --> 01:19:24.276]  And people said, okay, there's UN signs, the regulations and the treaties say the UN run it, but they'll never make you come by reservation and not let people in.
[01:19:26.837 --> 01:19:27.397]  Guess what?
[01:19:28.278 --> 01:19:28.838]  They do now.
[01:19:30.994 --> 01:19:31.834]  And that's
[01:19:50.697 --> 01:19:52.998]  And again, they're both nice numbers, you know what I mean?
[01:19:53.018 --> 01:20:01.882]  Imagine, good-looking professional women can't even go down to the creek on public property without snot-nosed girls.
[01:20:02.102 --> 01:20:03.002]  What are you doing here?
[01:20:03.202 --> 01:20:04.243]  You don't have a reservation!
[01:20:04.683 --> 01:20:06.184]  I said to my wife, did you get in their face?
[01:20:06.264 --> 01:20:08.105]  No, no, the country's just gone.
[01:20:08.185 --> 01:20:09.185]  We just got to move out of here.
[01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:10.326]  I'm like, move out?
[01:20:10.366 --> 01:20:11.346]  They'll get us the next place.
[01:20:11.466 --> 01:20:12.266]  I'm going down there!
[01:20:13.727 --> 01:20:15.548]  And again, this is a microcosm of everything.
[01:20:16.008 --> 01:20:20.030]  When are we going to start pushing back?
[01:20:22.455 --> 01:20:27.219]  Because of COVID-19, the biggest city park in the country?
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.501]  Pull up a satellite shot of Austin.
[01:20:30.181 --> 01:20:31.983]  The entire central
[01:20:33.843 --> 01:20:41.669]  And western area, you'll notice there's a green sliver, like a triangle, that starts downtown and goes all the way out into the hill country.
[01:20:42.190 --> 01:20:44.551]  And they bought even more land out in the hill country!
[01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:55.140]  300,000 plus acres in the hill country, owned by Austin and Kirk Watson, who became a state senator and set up a bank that administers all the land.
[01:20:56.461 --> 01:20:56.921]  Oh my God.
[01:20:57.942 --> 01:20:59.023]  Zoom in on Austin and show people.
[01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:00.124]  See where it's all green out there?
[01:21:00.144 --> 01:21:00.464]  Zoom in.
[01:21:01.485 --> 01:21:02.345]  No houses on that.
[01:21:02.405 --> 01:21:02.726]  Zoom in.
[01:21:04.195 --> 01:21:05.135]  See the Hill of Life right there?
[01:21:05.335 --> 01:21:08.216]  And then all the way out west, they have seized all of it.
[01:21:08.416 --> 01:21:11.297]  And I warned people at the time, I said, listen, the Greenbelt's already there!
[01:21:12.777 --> 01:21:13.977]  You can already go down on that!
[01:21:14.297 --> 01:21:16.658]  You don't need to buy all the land around it, they're gonna steal it!
[01:21:17.658 --> 01:21:19.098]  They're gonna turn around and develop it.
[01:21:19.298 --> 01:21:22.599]  And guess what they've done, out west of town, in the 300,000 acres they got?
[01:21:22.959 --> 01:21:25.800]  They built ranchettes on it, and they all became fabulously rich.
[01:21:26.983 --> 01:21:30.606]  And now they're seizing control, and it's the same in every country, every area.
[01:21:30.866 --> 01:21:36.590]  In the 80s and 90s, they grabbed the green belts, and now, worldwide, they're selling them off.
[01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:42.835]  But before they can do that, they gotta minimize it, they gotta cut it back, and they gotta teach you not to use it.
[01:21:44.436 --> 01:21:48.659]  And there's nothing a dirty liberal likes more than being abused by liberals above them.
[01:21:50.325 --> 01:21:52.207]  And so I'm down there going, we paid for this.
[01:21:52.467 --> 01:21:53.167]  It's in the law.
[01:21:53.227 --> 01:21:53.728]  It's ours.
[01:21:53.988 --> 01:21:55.629]  The police say it's not enforceable.
[01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:57.371]  There's not even a law to keep me off this.
[01:21:57.611 --> 01:21:58.852]  The police are, he's right.
[01:21:59.232 --> 01:22:00.513]  You kids get off this.
[01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:01.674]  You can't do this.
[01:22:01.895 --> 01:22:03.856]  The cops put their jobs on the line.
[01:22:04.076 --> 01:22:06.098]  They were all saluting me when I left.
[01:22:06.799 --> 01:22:07.879]  Because they know the law.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:09.821]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:22:10.882 --> 01:22:18.008]  The alchemy of the Austin American Statesman says I just screamed at innocent people guarding a swimming pool.
[01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:20.366]  Look at this crazy guy.
[01:22:20.687 --> 01:22:22.527]  He just screamed at lifeguards for no reason.
[01:22:22.847 --> 01:22:23.448]  I show up.
[01:22:25.768 --> 01:22:27.089]  They say, hey, you got a reservation?
[01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:27.729]  You got a pass?
[01:22:27.789 --> 01:22:28.289]  No, I don't.
[01:22:28.389 --> 01:22:29.790]  And all of a sudden, I hear, like, you're a jerk.
[01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:30.250]  I hate you.
[01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.570]  F you.
[01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:31.050]  I turn around.
[01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:32.211]  Girl's, like, flipping me off.
[01:22:34.192 --> 01:22:35.712]  These are hateful nobodies.
[01:22:36.272 --> 01:22:41.594]  But that's how tyranny works in Nazi Germany, the Hitler Youth, or in Malice Youth Brigades.
[01:22:41.814 --> 01:22:43.255]  Who do you think Antifa is?
[01:22:44.997 --> 01:22:50.003]  So again, this is a microcosm of everything on this planet right now.
[01:22:50.103 --> 01:22:51.125]  You're being herded.
[01:22:52.266 --> 01:22:53.708]  You're being taught to submit.
[01:22:56.294 --> 01:22:58.696]  And the footage people shot of the Greenbelt is just atrocious.
[01:22:58.917 --> 01:23:00.358]  We ought to go down there and shoot some B-roll for it.
[01:23:00.678 --> 01:23:01.299]  Totally mad.
[01:23:01.659 --> 01:23:04.022]  Hell, they'll just say it doesn't exist next.
[01:23:04.362 --> 01:23:05.723]  It'll be a conspiracy theory.
[01:23:06.304 --> 01:23:11.749]  If you say it exists, then they'll just bulldoze it all, put more golf courses on it, and say it never existed.
[01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:12.650]  I'm telling you.
[01:23:12.951 --> 01:23:16.895]  They're now saying that they might outlaw vaginal birth.
[01:23:18.211 --> 01:23:24.095]  I told you 20 years ago they'll someday say vaginal birth doesn't exist and that breastfeeding doesn't exist.
[01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:34.341]  And they already try to keep the baby away the first day so the mother's milk doesn't come in so they can put them on the formula and the brain is 20% smaller on average with a massive IQ reduction.
[01:23:34.662 --> 01:23:39.605]  This is all scientific turning us into these mindless jellyfish.
[01:23:40.643 --> 01:23:43.444]  But I'm going down there this Saturday noon.
[01:23:44.324 --> 01:23:45.825]  We're going to have our American flags.
[01:23:46.625 --> 01:23:49.066]  And we're going to march right past the contact tracers.
[01:23:49.426 --> 01:23:51.526]  And we're going to go down to that water and we're going to swim.
[01:23:51.566 --> 01:23:57.488]  So go swimming with Alex Jones in Barton Creek this Saturday high noon.
[01:23:58.609 --> 01:24:01.790]  And they'll probably stand down because that's what they do.
[01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:04.531]  They don't want to show us like Rosa Parks sitting at the front of the bus.
[01:24:05.031 --> 01:24:06.111]  I predict they stand down.
[01:24:06.151 --> 01:24:07.712]  But if they don't, even better.
[01:24:08.172 --> 01:24:08.492]  And then
[01:24:09.472 --> 01:24:10.992]  Next week, we're going to go somewhere else.
[01:24:11.012 --> 01:24:14.893]  We're going to go to Barton Springs itself.
[01:24:15.393 --> 01:24:17.574]  1710 Camp Craft Road, Austin, Texas.
[01:24:18.514 --> 01:24:17.574]  78746.
[01:24:18.874 --> 01:24:20.515]  The Hill of Life.
[01:24:22.055 --> 01:24:23.235]  And Owen loves to demonstrate.
[01:24:23.455 --> 01:24:26.296]  Owen will go out to the first Austin Friday Flag Drop.
[01:24:27.236 --> 01:24:27.516]  6 p.m.
[01:24:27.556 --> 01:24:29.577]  after a show downtown in front of the Capitol.
[01:24:29.817 --> 01:24:30.417]  He'll do that.
[01:24:30.497 --> 01:24:31.017]  I'll do this.
[01:24:31.417 --> 01:24:31.997]  Owen's invited.
[01:24:32.017 --> 01:24:32.878]  I know the crew wants to go.
[01:24:32.938 --> 01:24:33.598]  Bring your dogs.
[01:24:33.638 --> 01:24:34.198]  Bring everything.
[01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:40.417]  We're gonna go down there, we're gonna enjoy the land that Austin's citizens paid for that has been stolen.
[01:24:40.637 --> 01:24:43.440]  And wherever you are in the country, organize your own and do it.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:46.163]  Like the Chicago guy with the flag drop that's spreading everywhere.
[01:24:46.203 --> 01:24:47.624]  Great idea, let's adopt it.
[01:24:47.904 --> 01:24:53.290]  This idea, take back our parks, take back our beaches, take back our land, just like they've done in California.
[01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:54.271]  This is the same thing!
[01:24:54.491 --> 01:24:57.515]  And the police are saying, yeah, there's not even an ordinance, they can't stop you!
[01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:00.969]  But that turns into Jones bullies women, yeah.
[01:25:01.609 --> 01:25:03.290]  Oh, like Jeffrey Epstein tortures kids?
[01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:06.691]  You mean like that, you child-molesting devil-worshippers?
[01:25:06.891 --> 01:25:07.651]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:11.033]  I didn't even get to any of the news.
[01:25:11.293 --> 01:25:20.176]  I went off on a jag about the UN and world government must be a number one on Twitter and the deception around it and them putting up the fake story that I sent child porn to the Sandy Hook families.
[01:25:20.277 --> 01:25:22.137]  I mean, these people are the scum of the earth.
[01:25:23.098 --> 01:25:24.698]  The absolute scum of the earth.
[01:25:24.798 --> 01:25:26.099]  And no one buys their BS.
[01:25:28.635 --> 01:25:36.917]  So they're just going to lock everything down and try to get the cops, who they also want to abolish once they've done their bidding, to enforce a bunch of crap on you and your family.
[01:25:38.898 --> 01:25:40.338]  Now we've got some big guests coming up today.
[01:25:42.298 --> 01:25:46.559]  Sam Hyde is a big and funny comedian who's going to be co-hosting with Jay Dyer.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:52.861]  Ali Alexander, who writes for a lot of big publications like Culture.com, and I know Human Events is back.
[01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:53.701]  He's doing work over there.
[01:25:54.061 --> 01:25:54.901]  He's coming up with us.
[01:25:56.402 --> 01:25:56.982]  Next segment,
[01:25:59.079 --> 01:26:00.280]  And I've also got to go over this.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.101]  I mean, they're telling you don't have sex without wearing a mask.
[01:26:03.481 --> 01:26:08.443]  And now Democratic Party is ordering people in their Zoom meetings to wear masks by themselves.
[01:26:08.543 --> 01:26:10.624]  I mean, and you're like, well, that's ridiculous.
[01:26:10.704 --> 01:26:12.145]  It's all ridiculous.
[01:26:12.705 --> 01:26:13.906]  That's the point of a cult.
[01:26:14.646 --> 01:26:20.609]  Imagine if I said, well, if you're our listeners, send in videos of you standing on your head with your thumb up your ass.
[01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:22.510]  Oh, it's a family show.
[01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.810]  Sorry.
[01:26:27.664 --> 01:26:29.866]  Or, you know, join the Japanese Mafia.
[01:26:29.926 --> 01:26:32.507]  Cut off the first digit of your pinky finger.
[01:26:33.848 --> 01:26:36.190]  At least you get benefits, I guess, in the Japanese Mafia.
[01:26:36.210 --> 01:26:40.993]  You know what it's part of and I guess you gotta be tough or whatever to have you join them.
[01:26:41.773 --> 01:26:43.975]  This is a cult where you just are an idiot.
[01:26:46.036 --> 01:26:54.321]  And the globalists have all their white papers and their documents and their admissions that I went over in the first hour and I just sit here going, do people like to be dumbasses?
[01:26:54.341 --> 01:26:54.862]  But yeah, they do.
[01:26:56.021 --> 01:26:56.621]  Here's how it works.
[01:26:57.021 --> 01:26:58.202]  We'll go to a break and come back with our guest.
[01:26:58.222 --> 01:27:11.366]  I don't know what the term is, and I always overuse the analogy of the Hollywood casino, or you could use the analogy of the Nigerian email, but everybody, everybody knows why it's been scammed.
[01:27:12.807 --> 01:27:19.529]  And once you get scammed once, a lot of these scams go, Oh, actually give us more money and you'll make out good.
[01:27:19.769 --> 01:27:25.531]  And the people will never admit they've been conned and they keep giving more money to the scammer.
[01:27:28.024 --> 01:27:29.105]  And that's how this works.
[01:27:29.165 --> 01:27:33.470]  More liberty, more freedom, more... Because they don't want to admit they've been lied to.
[01:27:33.570 --> 01:27:36.694]  I mean, when I get scammed or screwed over, I want to admit to it.
[01:27:36.734 --> 01:27:37.815]  I want to see how it happened.
[01:27:37.895 --> 01:27:38.696]  I don't want to do it again.
[01:27:40.238 --> 01:27:42.400]  And I thought people were like me, but a lot of folks...
[01:27:43.601 --> 01:27:46.665]  Are not like yours truly or Ali Alexander coming up.
[01:27:46.945 --> 01:27:47.806]  They want to be scammed.
[01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:52.031]  So with 81 days out from the election, we're going to look at the election with Ali Alexander.
[01:27:52.051 --> 01:27:54.614]  He's a smart cookie, works for the Republican Party as a strategist.
[01:27:55.215 --> 01:27:59.099]  We'll talk about all the things that are unfolding and so much more straight ahead.
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:27:59.580]  And then.
[01:28:00.879 --> 01:28:04.320]  Got those big guests coming up in the fourth hour, and after that, War Room.
[01:28:05.081 --> 01:28:06.681]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:11.623]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, here in defiance of the globalist tyranny.
[01:28:12.163 --> 01:28:16.085]  Here at your deference, I'm very honored that you put us in attack formation.
[01:28:16.905 --> 01:28:18.786]  I'm very glad you've kept me at the front of the fight.
[01:28:19.486 --> 01:28:24.388]  All I wish is for you to keep me in this position because we have been having big success together.
[01:28:25.288 --> 01:28:28.471]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:28:28.511 --> 01:28:32.835]  Well, Ali Alexander's written for some of the biggest pro-human publications out there.
[01:28:33.116 --> 01:28:34.937]  He's a political consultant, philosopher, and activist.
[01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:43.806]  He's been consulting for Republican campaigns and conservative issues for over the last 12 years now on the national level, but now he's much more interested in philosophy and building a better society.
[01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:44.727]  AliAlexander.org.
[01:28:45.347 --> 01:28:45.967]  Hey, it's been a while.
[01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.128]  Thanks for having me back, Alex.
[01:28:47.148 --> 01:28:47.588]  Let's get into it.
[01:28:47.608 --> 01:28:50.770]  I mean, you got a lot of inside baseball with your connections in D.C.
[01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:53.111]  What's the scoop people aren't aware of yet?
[01:29:13.217 --> 01:29:20.141]  Well, I think what they're not aware of is that Joe Biden didn't actually want Kamala Harris, as Joe Biden pronounced it.
[01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:26.965]  It was actually Obama and some big donors like Soros who wanted to put Kamala on the ticket.
[01:29:27.325 --> 01:29:29.567]  And so, you know, he had to delay his decision.
[01:29:30.167 --> 01:29:33.389]  And and now she's on the ticket as president and waiting.
[01:29:33.989 --> 01:29:41.736]  And I think that she's going to do a lot of the bidding of kind of the global elite, the corporatist wing of the Democrat Party.
[01:29:42.036 --> 01:29:58.150]  But I think that this presents the Trump team with a unique opportunity to actually address the progressive concerns and some of the concerns of Occupy, you know, people that we don't traditionally agree with, but have some honest concerns about centralized power that, hey, this ticket isn't here to represent you.
[01:29:58.210 --> 01:29:59.211]  It's here to enslave you.
[01:30:00.538 --> 01:30:06.242]  Well that was one of my points I scribbled down last night when you agreed to come on the show is Tim Pool really liked him.
[01:30:06.422 --> 01:30:07.403]  Super entertaining.
[01:30:07.463 --> 01:30:08.083]  Super smart.
[01:30:08.423 --> 01:30:10.905]  A progressive I actually respect who has integrity.
[01:30:11.165 --> 01:30:14.167]  He attacks me and says I'm a wild man but he supports my free speech.
[01:30:14.427 --> 01:30:16.569]  He kind of focuses in on what they pick out of context.
[01:30:16.589 --> 01:30:16.929]  That's fine.
[01:30:16.989 --> 01:30:17.730]  I want him to come on.
[01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:18.570]  I want to go on his show.
[01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:19.791]  He's super successful.
[01:30:20.111 --> 01:30:20.852]  I tuned in the other night.
[01:30:21.212 --> 01:30:21.652]  He's a fraud.
[01:30:42.558 --> 01:30:48.668]  And his co-host was in ecstasy, and they basically put on red MAGA hats instead of the little customary black beanies.
[01:30:48.708 --> 01:30:57.021]  And so, there's a real populist liberal movement that at some point has got to wake up out of their trance that the left are Chai Kam loving fascists from hell.
[01:30:58.503 --> 01:31:00.525]  I think that that's exactly what's going to happen.
[01:31:00.825 --> 01:31:03.327]  Kamala's a cop, and she's a dirty cop.
[01:31:03.647 --> 01:31:04.628]  She's a bad cop.
[01:31:04.968 --> 01:31:08.691]  She kept black men in prison longer than their sentences.
[01:31:08.991 --> 01:31:14.135]  She threatened to jail black moms for having truant students.
[01:31:14.835 --> 01:31:19.779]  She came down on the side of the banks during the last financial crisis.
[01:31:20.159 --> 01:31:23.622]  This is a woman who is literally controlled by the global elite.
[01:31:24.142 --> 01:31:26.444]  And Joe Biden is there to provide her cover.
[01:31:26.704 --> 01:31:30.487]  But what a terrific opportunity to actually go into the black community.
[01:31:30.728 --> 01:31:34.171]  This is the community that abandoned her during the Democrat primary.
[01:31:34.191 --> 01:31:45.320]  Remember, she had to get out prior to Iowa because Andrew Yang, some random Asian dude in California, was polling higher than her in a state where she's a statewide elected official.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.200]  You know, federally.
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:51.902]  And so I think this is a terrific opportunity to say, hey, Wall Street doesn't have your back.
[01:31:52.182 --> 01:31:53.962]  Hollywood doesn't have your back.
[01:31:54.282 --> 01:31:58.103]  She's best friends with Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN.
[01:31:58.403 --> 01:32:09.786]  So this is a woman who is literally controlled by the global elite, the people who do not want borders, the people who want to vaccinate everyone, the people who don't believe that African-Americans, descendants of slavery,
[01:32:10.266 --> 01:32:18.091]  Under Jim Crow are unique people that all black people are the same, all Hispanics are the same, and they just want to control everybody.
[01:32:18.131 --> 01:32:21.052]  And so I think that this is, I'm glad that he put her on the ticket.
[01:32:21.112 --> 01:32:23.614]  What a weak pick from slow Joe.
[01:32:24.654 --> 01:32:29.357]  Well, I agree with you that she's the most establishment, soulless candidate we've probably ever seen.
[01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:31.078]  I mean, Joe's probably number two.
[01:32:31.098 --> 01:32:34.860]  So why does Soros and Jeff Bezos and others want her?
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.101]  Because she'll do whatever they say.
[01:32:37.586 --> 01:32:38.446]  Exactly right.
[01:32:38.466 --> 01:32:42.407]  You know, you and I are both religious people, spiritual people.
[01:32:42.427 --> 01:32:43.347]  We believe in Jesus.
[01:32:43.647 --> 01:32:55.850]  When I read the Bible and I read about these mysteries, one thing that I observe is there seem to be anchored points in time in which God has chosen to reveal some great secret, right?
[01:32:56.350 --> 01:33:05.333]  And I always say that, hey, when you're ahead of the curve, like you and I are, you can look at a mystery and your eyes are kind of averted from it.
[01:33:05.533 --> 01:33:06.733]  And when you look at Kamala,
[01:33:07.313 --> 01:33:11.995]  Your instincts are to try to reconcile it in kind of a Hegelian sense.
[01:33:12.035 --> 01:33:14.956]  You want to say, well, the left hates her and the right hates her.
[01:33:15.276 --> 01:33:16.417]  What am I wrong about?
[01:33:16.477 --> 01:33:20.038]  But the truth is, the left hates her and the right hates her.
[01:33:20.338 --> 01:33:21.819]  She is an authoritarian.
[01:33:22.159 --> 01:33:23.480]  She is a sellout.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:29.423]  I think that Team Trump is making a tremendous mistake as painting her as radical left.
[01:33:29.783 --> 01:33:31.244]  She is soulless.
[01:33:31.684 --> 01:33:35.467]  She will do whatever the DNC donors want.
[01:33:35.707 --> 01:33:37.888]  Whatever Wall Street wants.
[01:33:38.088 --> 01:33:40.730]  Whatever Hollywood executives want.
[01:33:40.770 --> 01:33:42.471]  Whatever the EU wants.
[01:33:42.811 --> 01:33:44.452]  She is a soulless candidate.
[01:33:44.672 --> 01:33:46.613]  She is an anti-black candidate.
[01:33:46.853 --> 01:33:48.394]  And she's ridiculously fake!
[01:33:48.434 --> 01:33:54.759]  I mean, she was polling, what, during most of the primaries at 1%, but the system wanted her, and now they're going to try to force feed her.
[01:33:54.779 --> 01:33:58.742]  So you're saying this could be like the Bible says, God turns the elites over to delusion?
[01:33:59.022 --> 01:34:00.323]  Are you saying this is their delusion?
[01:34:01.444 --> 01:34:02.184]  Absolutely.
[01:34:02.284 --> 01:34:12.732]  This is going to be fantastic because the media has already painted, you know, Politico, New York Times, even the Wall Street Journal has said, hey, progressives are excited about Kamala Harris.
[01:34:13.317 --> 01:34:16.440]  You go on YouTube, you go on Instagram, you go on TikTok.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:19.182]  That is not the story of progressives.
[01:34:19.222 --> 01:34:24.006]  Look, if it made Tim Pool put on a Trump hat, I mean, that's a canary in the coal mine.
[01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:30.837]  It really is, and there's these other people, you know, Jimmy Dore or whatever, I don't watch him.
[01:34:30.877 --> 01:34:31.858]  There's Tim Black.
[01:34:32.398 --> 01:34:33.639]  There's all these TikTokers.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.641]  There's a black Instagram community.
[01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:41.266]  You go to the original sources, the primary sources, and this is a ticket that might actually collapse.
[01:34:41.546 --> 01:34:46.991]  You might actually see Donald Trump capable of getting 370 electoral votes or 400 electoral votes.
[01:34:48.932 --> 01:34:58.615]  If he runs right, if he leans into America first, if he talks about de-platforming, if he comes into the black community and says, let's start negotiating with your community and what do you guys need?
[01:34:58.975 --> 01:35:00.855]  Then I think that the Biden administration- Well, that's right.
[01:35:00.875 --> 01:35:05.617]  If Trump cuts out all the leftist managers of the blacks, because everybody's managed by the local capos.
[01:35:06.257 --> 01:35:07.637]  The Democratic Party runs Austin.
[01:35:07.677 --> 01:35:09.338]  I live under their crap, even though I hate their guts.
[01:35:09.678 --> 01:35:14.919]  But if Trump opens a negotiation directly up with the inner city and poor people, period, they want that.
[01:35:15.359 --> 01:35:17.820]  It would absolutely cut out the poverty pimp middlemen.
[01:35:19.179 --> 01:35:20.640]  Absolutely.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.621]  And here's another little antidote that we all need to watch.
[01:35:23.961 --> 01:35:25.622]  You have Kanye West running.
[01:35:26.142 --> 01:35:29.503]  You have Ice Cube saying that he doesn't want to vote for the Democrats.
[01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:33.825]  You have P. Diddy saying that he doesn't want to vote unless he can negotiate something for the black community.
[01:35:34.205 --> 01:35:37.466]  The black community is begging to be independent for the first time.
[01:35:37.526 --> 01:35:40.427]  And I get that Republicans and conservatives are skeptical.
[01:35:40.648 --> 01:35:43.949]  They think, oh, we can't do any outreach with the black community.
[01:35:44.689 --> 01:35:49.050]  Never before has anyone done any honest, honest and earnest outreach.
[01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:50.850]  So forget outreach, let's talk about inclusion.
[01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:53.931]  I found with my show, black folks love me without me ever even courting them.
[01:35:53.951 --> 01:35:54.831]  They just love the show.
[01:35:55.271 --> 01:36:00.512]  They love you because, Alex, you're authentic and that's all they want to know is that you're not hiding anything from them.
[01:36:00.712 --> 01:36:09.714]  So let's forget BLM and let's talk about, instead of Black Lives Matter, which isn't about lives at all, let's talk about black equity, black assets, black land.
[01:36:09.894 --> 01:36:11.494]  Let's talk about black participation.
[01:36:11.514 --> 01:36:11.855]  Exactly.
[01:36:11.875 --> 01:36:13.375]  You don't want a one-time paycheck.
[01:36:13.415 --> 01:36:14.015]  You want equity.
[01:36:14.966 --> 01:36:15.687]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:15.707 --> 01:36:16.147]  That's what I want.
[01:36:16.928 --> 01:36:18.710]  And that binds us all together, right?
[01:36:18.851 --> 01:36:24.718]  You know, we're not worshipping the free market, but we're all engaged in the marketplace of ideas and the marketplace of commerce.
[01:36:24.998 --> 01:36:26.540]  And that's what the Democrats don't want.
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:29.043]  Everybody needs chips in the game.
[01:36:29.063 --> 01:36:30.504]  Everybody needs chips to play.
[01:36:30.544 --> 01:36:31.546]  And as you point out,
[01:36:32.046 --> 01:36:35.227]  You know, the black community is so used to, okay, there's all this funding, where is it going?
[01:36:35.267 --> 01:36:43.369]  And you point out, it's the middle managers, it's the aldermen, it's the NAACP, it's the black preacher who doesn't even, you know, may not believe in Christ.
[01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:46.290]  And all of these grifters are just grifting.
[01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:49.131]  The black community is like, is there any party that will take us seriously?
[01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:52.972]  And so I think that the team Trump needs to be aggressively talking.
[01:36:52.992 --> 01:36:56.373]  What did it do in the black community when Trump basically doubled funding the black colleges?
[01:36:56.393 --> 01:36:57.493]  Did that even faze anybody?
[01:36:58.903 --> 01:37:01.565]  I think that it created less opposition.
[01:37:01.605 --> 01:37:05.187]  So it may not have created more voters, but it created less opposition.
[01:37:05.467 --> 01:37:09.250]  And the way that I look at elections, don't look at it as a minus one and a plus one.
[01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:10.750]  There's a zero in between.
[01:37:11.111 --> 01:37:17.955]  So black voters that decide to vote for Kanye or black voters that say, hey, I don't like Trump and I don't like Biden.
[01:37:18.015 --> 01:37:19.916]  I'm going to choose not to vote in that election.
[01:37:19.956 --> 01:37:20.917]  I'll vote down ballot.
[01:37:21.157 --> 01:37:22.017]  That's the win as well.
[01:37:22.037 --> 01:37:22.518]  Stay there.
[01:37:22.578 --> 01:37:24.279]  Ali Alexander, political analyst, stay with us.
[01:37:26.966 --> 01:37:29.148]  So, globalism's been in trouble for a long time.
[01:37:29.168 --> 01:37:33.571]  It's an authoritarian, corporate, fascist model working with communists and others around the planet.
[01:37:34.611 --> 01:37:39.255]  Doesn't like nation-states, doesn't like independent cultures, wants homogenized, corporate-controlled systems.
[01:37:40.195 --> 01:37:48.761]  And they said in the Rockefeller Foundation event 201, lockstep, you name it, that they would use the panic over a virus to bring in authoritarian control.
[01:37:48.781 --> 01:37:49.802]  We covered that in the first hour.
[01:37:51.027 --> 01:37:58.515]  So Ali Alexander is a very smart political analyst, and he does a great job working with the White House and other people, and I agree with him on the surface.
[01:37:59.616 --> 01:38:06.543]  Kamala Harris looks absolutely terrible, and she's hated by the left, but she's loved by the establishment, because they want a yes person in there.
[01:38:07.023 --> 01:38:09.986]  And CNN's already reported that Biden's the placeholder for her.
[01:38:10.947 --> 01:38:13.810]  So it is President Kamala Harris.
[01:38:16.635 --> 01:38:19.256]  And we'll go over some of the terrible background with her.
[01:38:19.316 --> 01:38:22.118]  But what about the issue of Pelosi and all of them wargaming?
[01:38:22.858 --> 01:38:24.959]  We're going to have blue states secede.
[01:38:24.999 --> 01:38:26.359]  We're going to say popular vote.
[01:38:27.039 --> 01:38:29.400]  We're going to have our own inauguration.
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:32.081]  They've said all this, and John Podesta's had wargames.
[01:38:32.121 --> 01:38:35.643]  They're really pushing this as the talking point of their next hoax.
[01:38:36.383 --> 01:38:41.565]  Probably a long shot, should fail, but this one is such a bigger crisis, it'll hurt the economy.
[01:38:42.525 --> 01:38:44.746]  They'll try to activate their fake race riots.
[01:38:45.227 --> 01:38:49.408]  From you talking to your DC Connections and your own research, what do you think of that move?
[01:38:49.668 --> 01:38:55.731]  And they picked her because she's a little bit African, and so she can play into the whole race narrative.
[01:38:56.011 --> 01:39:01.233]  The Democrats want to smokescreen their attempt at overthrow of the election and Trump as a race riot.
[01:39:02.403 --> 01:39:05.686]  Yeah, they need this to be close enough to cheat.
[01:39:06.327 --> 01:39:14.434]  And I've described this as truly, truly an event that you couldn't you couldn't picture it really before this year.
[01:39:14.454 --> 01:39:19.239]  You know, we all watched in 2000 with Bush v. Gore.
[01:39:19.579 --> 01:39:25.385]  But imagine, if you will, 10 states having their own Bush v. Gore crisis.
[01:39:26.105 --> 01:39:37.651]  In different federal courts around the country and the Supreme Court can't take it all up and consolidate the cases because each state has its own election laws.
[01:39:38.051 --> 01:39:49.957]  So this is an event that if one side doesn't win by a lot, you're not looking at electors who are able to cast votes in December when they are constitutionally obligated to.
[01:39:50.237 --> 01:39:54.979]  We could be looking at a, I hate to say this Alex, but we could be looking at a temporary
[01:39:55.842 --> 01:40:00.106]  President Pelosi in January because we won't have a president.
[01:40:00.626 --> 01:40:16.301]  And so if we go through the Podesta war game, which is to find two or three states of the 10 that are being contested in which the governors can disrupt the electoral process and not send electors or send unfaithful electors,
[01:40:16.861 --> 01:40:17.082]  I think?
[01:40:28.982 --> 01:40:36.490]  Has not been predicted or forecasted until John Podesta and his scheming ways thought of it.
[01:40:36.551 --> 01:40:44.840]  So we ought to be really nervous and that's why I'm so passionate that Team Trump needs to collapse the ticket on the other side.
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:50.206]  Tell the progressives and tell the left the truth about these authoritarian
[01:40:50.606 --> 01:40:53.550]  Mass incarceration, war on drug, bigots.
[01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:55.512]  These corporatists on the left.
[01:40:55.893 --> 01:41:02.681]  And we need the right and the left to come together behind either a President Kanye West or a President Donald Trump.
[01:41:06.386 --> 01:41:08.667]  Infinity, trillion infinity, I agree with you.
[01:41:09.888 --> 01:41:14.570]  That's the answer, because Trump can't be confident and go, oh, Kamala's hated, they're a joke, I'm gonna win.
[01:41:14.650 --> 01:41:21.693]  No, they admit their strategy is contesting it, tying up the states, and then having the military decide what to do, which is a criminal act.
[01:41:21.713 --> 01:41:29.177]  I think you should head-on expose that, and head-on destroy Kamala, and destroy Biden, and just annihilate them.
[01:41:29.257 --> 01:41:33.579]  Don't take it as they're weak candidates, that's the sucker punch, you're absolutely right.
[01:41:34.471 --> 01:41:36.031]  So, this is what I think about.
[01:41:36.192 --> 01:41:45.614]  I think about, um, and then, you know, maybe it even needs to be an InfoWars special where we war game freedom, but think about what that would present.
[01:41:45.754 --> 01:41:46.955]  The dollar would crash.
[01:41:47.355 --> 01:41:48.455]  The dollar would crash.
[01:41:48.875 --> 01:41:50.756]  China is ready for the dollar to crash.
[01:41:50.776 --> 01:41:56.438]  They've already been buying, for the past year and a half, oil in their native currency, and they're willing to buy it above the average.
[01:41:56.458 --> 01:41:57.678]  Let me just stop you because you're on fire.
[01:41:58.098 --> 01:42:00.380]  Soros is betting against the dollar, against the market.
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:01.940]  We're in a bubble war.
[01:42:01.981 --> 01:42:03.882]  China has a much bigger bubble, so does the EU.
[01:42:04.282 --> 01:42:06.303]  But all our media is saying America's done.
[01:42:07.124 --> 01:42:15.429]  When Americans see mainline MSNBC, CNBC, New York Times saying America's done, they're trying to destroy your 401Ks.
[01:42:15.809 --> 01:42:16.670]  Trump's winning.
[01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:18.351]  Come in, support Trump.
[01:42:18.591 --> 01:42:19.972]  The Republic will survive.
[01:42:20.192 --> 01:42:21.673]  We'll stabilize the global currency.
[01:42:21.833 --> 01:42:24.675]  But if we fail, it's total war in the streets.
[01:42:24.735 --> 01:42:25.255]  Collapse!
[01:42:25.275 --> 01:42:26.016]  This is insane!
[01:42:26.676 --> 01:42:27.497]  Total collapse.
[01:42:28.037 --> 01:42:32.460]  Ask yourself, why did China move to a digital currency during the panic?
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:36.143]  Why is China brokering its own deal with Venezuela?
[01:42:36.563 --> 01:42:40.306]  Why is China buying Middle East oil in its native currency?
[01:42:40.606 --> 01:42:42.547]  We are already at war with China.
[01:42:42.867 --> 01:42:45.189]  China wants the collapse of the United States.
[01:42:45.509 --> 01:42:47.991]  And people are going to think, oh, I'm on Robinhood.
[01:42:48.291 --> 01:42:49.632]  Oh, I'm buying cheap shares.
[01:42:49.912 --> 01:42:51.153]  Oh, my God, stocks go up.
[01:42:51.173 --> 01:42:51.834]  Stocks go up.
[01:42:52.094 --> 01:42:53.255]  When you wake up one day,
[01:42:53.995 --> 01:42:55.716]  And the dollar is devalued by 75%.
[01:42:57.536 --> 01:42:58.997]  You're going to go into a panic.
[01:42:59.297 --> 01:43:06.180]  And so I tell people, like, you really don't know how bad this is about to be if Soros and Podesta get their way.
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:10.341]  They just need the election to be close enough to create chaos.
[01:43:10.381 --> 01:43:12.222]  They don't even have to win, Alex.
[01:43:13.965 --> 01:43:16.009]  Ali, what you're saying is not your opinion.
[01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:17.010]  It's what's happening.
[01:43:17.351 --> 01:43:18.433]  It's the real battle space.
[01:43:18.834 --> 01:43:25.686]  And then I look at Antifa and leftists and they're praising the fall of the country and they don't get if that happens their lives are over as they know it.
[01:43:25.906 --> 01:43:26.687]  These are idiots!
[01:43:27.997 --> 01:43:29.118]  These are complete idiots.
[01:43:29.378 --> 01:43:42.487]  They need to understand this, and I don't want to dive too deep because people's heads will explode, but what people need to understand about the French Revolution is that Karl Marx then went to France and studied in the Paris Commune.
[01:43:42.807 --> 01:43:52.774]  So when we were looking at Chaz and Chop in Seattle, I predicted everything that was going to happen weeks ahead of time because I had studied what was called the Paris Commune.
[01:43:53.014 --> 01:43:55.076]  And when you understand that they moved gold
[01:43:56.081 --> 01:43:59.604]  Before they start these little socialist Marxist experiment.
[01:43:59.624 --> 01:44:09.093]  And when you understand that Karl Marx was in France beta testing what needed to happen in Russia, you will understand that this is a cyclical problem that we have.
[01:44:09.353 --> 01:44:11.896]  And it's as spiritual as it is political.
[01:44:12.517 --> 01:44:23.132]  And when you understand that the Marxist, you have to read Marx to understand, look, it's a Republican conservative talking point that socialism leads to communism, but you need to read Marx.
[01:44:23.473 --> 01:44:28.000]  Marx promises that communism can lead to a more perfect socialism.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.622]  And so you have to understand, Marxism is inherently a lie to everyone.
[01:44:31.902 --> 01:44:43.710]  It says, no God, we can be better socialists, no individual, and what they're doing is they're suckering everybody into a permanent method of chaos, destruction, hell, violence.
[01:44:43.770 --> 01:44:50.615]  A giant black hole to consolidate power, and they always build a Napoleonic or Hitlerian tyranny on top of the collapse.
[01:44:51.535 --> 01:44:53.896]  Always, always, always.
[01:44:54.176 --> 01:45:01.537]  So, our fight in November is literally to stave off the collapse of the United States, and that's not a conspiracy.
[01:45:01.737 --> 01:45:02.938]  That is what is happening.
[01:45:03.158 --> 01:45:08.659]  Oh, they admit that's the game plan, and I just, I understand Trump doesn't want to look authoritarian.
[01:45:08.679 --> 01:45:16.381]  I mean, they're acting like if he sends anybody to protect federal courthouses, he's bad, but at a certain point, he can't stand down if they try this during the general election.
[01:45:17.592 --> 01:45:19.734]  Yeah, Law and Order tweets don't work.
[01:45:20.054 --> 01:45:25.919]  What work is putting down the riots that are attracting other violent opportunists to them.
[01:45:25.939 --> 01:45:27.301]  And that's what I told the White House.
[01:45:27.581 --> 01:45:29.462]  I said, look, normally I'm all for optics.
[01:45:29.502 --> 01:45:31.404]  And Alex, you know that about me.
[01:45:31.484 --> 01:45:33.766]  It's like, even appearing with you, I may get canceled.
[01:45:33.806 --> 01:45:34.787]  I'm the last guy... No, you're right.
[01:45:34.807 --> 01:45:35.307]  Alex, stay there.
[01:45:35.347 --> 01:45:36.048]  You've got a lot of courage.
[01:45:36.108 --> 01:45:38.890]  Ali Alexander's Twitter at A-L-I.
[01:45:38.911 --> 01:45:39.531]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:39.551 --> 01:45:41.253]  He's going to lay out the big stuff right now.
[01:45:41.533 --> 01:45:44.555]  But America's facing its greatest threat since its inception.
[01:45:44.575 --> 01:45:45.036]  Stay with us.
[01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:49.572]  The police are a reflection of us.
[01:45:50.533 --> 01:45:53.595]  They're under state law, under municipal law.
[01:45:55.477 --> 01:46:00.001]  Most are good, some are bad, and we hold their feet for the fire.
[01:46:04.325 --> 01:46:13.653]  But in the official City of Austin budget, they call for demolishing the police department and breaking it up under other departments of the city and making other departments the police.
[01:46:15.717 --> 01:46:22.621]  And you have George Soros getting the new county attorney elected, city attorney, who says he wants to abolish the police.
[01:46:22.641 --> 01:46:23.341]  Well, here's the Hill.
[01:46:25.462 --> 01:46:30.765]  Reporting right now, 150 million, Austin City Council approves cuts to police department.
[01:46:31.365 --> 01:46:31.786]  And guess what?
[01:46:31.806 --> 01:46:36.468]  It's going to go to their code enforcement and their SJWs to make sure you're locked in your houses.
[01:46:36.828 --> 01:46:44.953]  They're creating a large new bureaucratic force that will call the police, but on you for political actions, not for muggings or killings.
[01:46:46.738 --> 01:46:49.439]  The answer to this is what's on Infowars.com.
[01:46:49.499 --> 01:46:53.000]  Atlanta DA who charged a cop with murder loses re-election.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:55.861]  Hey, I think the cop shouldn't have done what he did.
[01:46:56.462 --> 01:46:57.382]  He was getting beat up.
[01:46:57.982 --> 01:46:59.823]  The guy was shooting his own taser at him.
[01:47:00.743 --> 01:47:02.264]  The cop got scared and shot the guy.
[01:47:02.384 --> 01:47:04.284]  But maybe he loses his job.
[01:47:04.545 --> 01:47:06.585]  The point is he didn't want to go kill the guy that night.
[01:47:08.306 --> 01:47:10.587]  And look, when a cop kills somebody, it's the biggest thing in the world.
[01:47:11.445 --> 01:47:13.747]  But when citizens kill each other, it's not even an issue.
[01:47:14.507 --> 01:47:16.048]  Very, very serious situation.
[01:47:16.108 --> 01:47:23.954]  This is the system coming in, not to abolish the police, but to cut their funding to make them politically come under globalist control.
[01:47:24.615 --> 01:47:30.018]  And so they couldn't have the Justice Department get control of police under Obama and under the Clintons.
[01:47:30.539 --> 01:47:34.822]  So now they're just having the UN and the bureaucracies do it through the city councils.
[01:47:34.882 --> 01:47:36.183]  It's called munialization.
[01:47:37.504 --> 01:47:40.246]  And if I know about munialization and the Strong Cities Initiative,
[01:47:41.823 --> 01:47:43.847]  Then Trump and the Justice Department should.
[01:47:44.921 --> 01:47:45.962]  Or are they amateurs?
[01:47:46.062 --> 01:47:47.802]  Ali Alexander talks to the White House all the time.
[01:47:47.842 --> 01:47:50.144]  He's a high-level political analyst, really smart guy.
[01:47:50.164 --> 01:47:53.845]  He's on Twitter, at A-L-I, at Ali.
[01:47:54.346 --> 01:47:57.467]  Ali, we were getting into their plan to scuttle the election.
[01:47:57.507 --> 01:47:58.387]  They know they're losing.
[01:47:58.688 --> 01:47:59.948]  There's not a giant landslide.
[01:47:59.968 --> 01:48:00.869]  They're going to try it.
[01:48:01.309 --> 01:48:02.790]  They're going to say if they have the popular vote.
[01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:04.270]  They've already said they're going to break away.
[01:48:04.831 --> 01:48:10.573]  Once we saw Podesta admit that in the New York Times, we understood why they were saying Trump's going to try to stay.
[01:48:10.973 --> 01:48:12.434]  If he contested, he's a dictator.
[01:48:12.654 --> 01:48:13.655]  They're going to contest.
[01:48:14.275 --> 01:48:18.057]  I think that we have to have a physical presence out there.
[01:48:18.077 --> 01:48:22.860]  I think that men should be in eight-hour shifts outside of their churches.
[01:48:43.379 --> 01:48:49.133]  You know, in three rotations, I think that our physical, peaceful presence.
[01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:57.270]  is chilling enough to the central planners that they will delay their plans by 50 or 100 years.
[01:48:57.510 --> 01:49:03.072]  You know, the Bible writes that we will lose many battles and that God wins in the end.
[01:49:03.572 --> 01:49:06.332]  And so I think that we can ask for God's intercession.
[01:49:06.852 --> 01:49:15.974]  I think that if we faithfully show up and show that physical presence that we are the actual majority of peaceful people, Democrats and Republicans, mind you,
[01:49:16.354 --> 01:49:23.911]  That don't want a bigger government that don't want to quote defund the police only to create five new
[01:49:24.798 --> 01:49:29.139]  Police, five new badges and five new people who can detain you.
[01:49:29.199 --> 01:49:31.660]  You know, that's that's their secret plan, as you point out.
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:36.001]  And we've watched this again and again in other countries, again and again over centuries.
[01:49:36.361 --> 01:49:43.603]  So what we need to do is I think that we need to have a physical presence in the physical space and stop making this digital.
[01:49:43.923 --> 01:49:45.923]  We all need to show up at our churches.
[01:49:45.963 --> 01:49:47.243]  We need to defend our homes.
[01:49:47.483 --> 01:49:52.745]  And we need to demand that Republican governors stop governing by executive fiat without the state.
[01:49:53.005 --> 01:49:53.565]  You just said it.
[01:49:54.085 --> 01:50:02.054]  When 25 to 40,000 people showed up in Virginia, peacefully, black, white, Hispanic, old, young, no accidents, no arrests, it scared them.
[01:50:02.435 --> 01:50:05.778]  They launched this whole thing then, and that's what scares them so much.
[01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:11.765]  And as you said, under 7277 and other memorandums, the left has wanted the State Department
[01:50:12.546 --> 01:50:17.794]  We get disarmed, but then the new peacekeeper force, that's just a paramilitary, comes in.
[01:50:17.874 --> 01:50:22.180]  So as you said, Austin, you nailed it, is creating five new.
[01:50:22.341 --> 01:50:23.442]  Albuquerque, four new.
[01:50:23.943 --> 01:50:24.824]  LA, four new.
[01:50:25.145 --> 01:50:26.467]  San Francisco, four new.
[01:50:26.547 --> 01:50:27.488]  New York, three new.
[01:50:28.109 --> 01:50:33.412]  Paramilitary, quasi-armed, some are armed, bureaucratic forces they call social workers.
[01:50:33.772 --> 01:50:37.454]  No, they're SJWs with guns that have the police as back.
[01:50:37.474 --> 01:50:46.119]  So they're taking the police money with at least some history of America, Bill of Rights, due process, and transferring it to basically Antifa.
[01:50:46.359 --> 01:50:47.620]  Talk about a nightmare scenario.
[01:50:48.789 --> 01:50:49.930]  Nightmare scenario.
[01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:52.832]  And we need to somehow communicate this.
[01:50:52.852 --> 01:50:54.092]  The Republican Party can't.
[01:50:54.513 --> 01:50:55.973]  The conservative movement can't.
[01:50:56.474 --> 01:51:01.897]  But patriots and well-read thinkers can explain this to people.
[01:51:02.137 --> 01:51:18.247]  Look, let's say that your police department, like Broward County, $1 billion, if they defund that and turn that into a $500 million institution, what will happen is, yeah, they'll create three or four or five more departments.
[01:51:18.727 --> 01:51:20.288]  They'll all get fancy badges.
[01:51:20.548 --> 01:51:27.172]  They'll all have the ability to do extrajudicial actions against you where they temporarily suspend your rights, right?
[01:51:27.192 --> 01:51:28.732]  This is how we got the FISA court.
[01:51:28.752 --> 01:51:29.773]  Turn your power off.
[01:51:29.813 --> 01:51:31.254]  Turn your water off.
[01:51:31.814 --> 01:51:32.654]  Contact tracers.
[01:51:32.674 --> 01:51:33.355]  Take your kids.
[01:51:34.135 --> 01:51:36.997]  LA and Albuquerque already set it up!
[01:51:38.017 --> 01:51:38.978]  All without warrants.
[01:51:39.738 --> 01:51:41.099]  All without due process.
[01:51:41.399 --> 01:51:43.501]  And these people will be given a physical badge.
[01:51:43.741 --> 01:51:46.483]  And they may not be given a gun, but they're given something worse.
[01:51:46.883 --> 01:51:53.327]  They're given authoritarian control over your ability to engage in commerce, your ability to live, your ability to raise your child.
[01:51:53.547 --> 01:51:58.891]  And what will happen is, then you'll look at the total budget, Alex, and it'll be $3 billion between all these institutions.
[01:51:59.191 --> 01:52:00.092]  So what did they do?
[01:52:00.412 --> 01:52:01.933]  They actually funded
[01:52:02.393 --> 01:52:03.174]  The police!
[01:52:03.755 --> 01:52:09.780]  And so we need to explain this to those leftists, these feral people, because they're being controlled by central planners.
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:12.223]  And that's why when we show up peacefully...
[01:52:13.123 --> 01:52:14.343]  The funding stops.
[01:52:14.643 --> 01:52:15.404]  No, I agree.
[01:52:15.424 --> 01:52:17.784]  So everybody, don't listen to what we're saying.
[01:52:18.184 --> 01:52:18.865]  Make a sign.
[01:52:18.945 --> 01:52:19.745]  Randomly go out.
[01:52:19.805 --> 01:52:27.727]  Just see citizens everywhere, not listening to the COVID lockdown, because they tell nationalists, patriots, Christians, conservatives, you don't go out.
[01:52:28.187 --> 01:52:29.007]  Leftists, you go out.
[01:52:29.067 --> 01:52:30.127]  No, we all go out.
[01:52:30.508 --> 01:52:32.068]  We all have our own independent message.
[01:52:32.348 --> 01:52:35.809]  That will scare the living hell out of the left, just seeing citizens on the streets.
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:44.145]  Yeah, because the camera, the camera is a propaganda tool and it's a medium that they know lends itself to automatic belief.
[01:52:44.465 --> 01:52:50.168]  And so when you see citizens engaging with other citizens, they know, well, it's time for this to stop.
[01:52:50.769 --> 01:52:52.490]  And, you know, we saw that with Parkland.
[01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:59.334]  We've seen that with the BLM riots back in... That's right, we bring the cameras, they stop their propaganda.
[01:52:59.714 --> 01:53:03.417]  We just have to hit the streets and it'll go away like sunlight disinfects.
[01:53:04.332 --> 01:53:05.792]  Right, and we've seen that in St.
[01:53:05.812 --> 01:53:06.092]  Louis.
[01:53:06.132 --> 01:53:09.853]  What happens when Catholics pray in front of the statue of St.
[01:53:09.874 --> 01:53:10.154]  Louis?
[01:53:10.574 --> 01:53:12.034]  It's like, people stop.
[01:53:12.394 --> 01:53:15.815]  And so, there is, you know, our fight really is against principalities.
[01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:17.436]  It really is against principalities.
[01:53:17.456 --> 01:53:17.736]  You're right.
[01:53:17.776 --> 01:53:22.417]  We're not, because God's there, but we have to take the field, then God gives us the power.
[01:53:22.617 --> 01:53:23.977]  But we have to make a step.
[01:53:24.697 --> 01:53:25.718]  It's an act of faith.
[01:53:25.798 --> 01:53:29.959]  It's an act to say, they're violent and I will walk out there with the message of peace.
[01:53:30.991 --> 01:53:32.632]  And I will, I will leave it to God.
[01:53:32.652 --> 01:53:39.958]  It's like using the Star Wars cheesy analogy, Obi-Wan Kenobi tells Luke Skywalker when he first picks up a lightsaber, you've taken your first step into a bigger world.
[01:53:40.618 --> 01:53:42.880]  And that's what people need to take that first step.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:44.701]  The first step is the biggest step.
[01:53:45.942 --> 01:53:46.122]  Right.
[01:53:46.582 --> 01:53:48.264]  And that's why they closed our churches, Alex.
[01:53:48.704 --> 01:53:58.891]  And that's why even Republican governors, I mean, I mean, I, you know, I don't want to shit on too much, pardon my French, but, but like Governor Abbott has gone from one of the most conservative governors in the country to
[01:54:00.623 --> 01:54:01.504]  A complete failure.
[01:54:01.664 --> 01:54:03.425]  I mean just a complete failure.
[01:54:03.465 --> 01:54:08.989]  Do you have any insight into why he totally rolled over and became Gavin Newsom's boy?
[01:54:10.230 --> 01:54:27.882]  What I'll say is I put some tweets out there and I'm really close with, he's actually a former, I'm a former vendor of his when he was the Attorney General and I love him and he follows me on Twitter and he runs his own Twitter account and I'm friends with some of his consultants and I expressed my dismay and they were like, well read the executive order, read the executive order.
[01:54:29.156 --> 01:54:38.420]  If a church voluntarily shuts down because it can't cooperate with regulations, that's just as bad as you shutting it down, or Newsom shutting it down, or Cuomo shutting it down.
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:44.642]  So, we have a fundamental disagreement, but yeah, it's almost like something in Greg's personality changed.
[01:54:44.762 --> 01:54:52.805]  It's very bizarre, it's very concerning, and I don't think... Well, I mean, I know people inside there, and they say he locks himself in a room now and will talk to no one for a month, two months.
[01:54:54.366 --> 01:54:55.886]  Nothing would surprise me at this point.
[01:54:55.926 --> 01:54:56.847]  I think that we've seen...
[01:54:59.159 --> 01:55:00.460]  It's just shocking to me.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.580]  I've seen, I've very rarely ever seen anything like this.
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.321]  Well they say when the chips are down, you found out who's who.
[01:55:05.701 --> 01:55:09.903]  Ali Alexander, we know he's a great guy, not a coward, a smart cookie, he's our guest.
[01:55:10.383 --> 01:55:19.106]  One more segment with him, and then Jay Dreyer has Sam Hyde, the big, famous, well-spoken, and informative, and funny comedian coming on.
[01:55:19.546 --> 01:55:23.508]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, at Ali on Twitter.
[01:55:29.642 --> 01:55:36.369]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:55:36.469 --> 01:55:38.752]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:55:40.894 --> 01:55:45.960]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:55:49.491 --> 01:55:52.794]  I've been thinking about this for four or five days since we decided to do it.
[01:55:52.814 --> 01:56:04.744]  I don't know what to call tonight's broadcast, but I know that we're going to start doing a couple nights a week, special commercial-free broadcasts that are on the radio and TV satellites for stations that want them, and at Band.Video and Infowars.com.
[01:56:04.764 --> 01:56:05.985]  We usually get a couple hundred thousand.
[01:56:07.128 --> 01:56:13.271]  People that tune into these, sometimes we've had up to three million that end up clicking these, especially, that was back during the last election.
[01:56:13.991 --> 01:56:18.834]  We had some of these that had three million, special broadcast, three million IP addresses hitting us.
[01:56:19.874 --> 01:56:22.416]  So that's when you get excited and you spread the word and you do it.
[01:56:22.636 --> 01:56:25.777]  That's outside of YouTube, outside of Facebook, that's Band.Video.
[01:56:25.797 --> 01:56:34.922]  So tonight, I was sitting back thinking about my next question to Ali Alexander, and I hadn't really plugged except yesterday that we're gonna go live tonight, commercial free,
[01:56:37.414 --> 01:56:38.155]  7 to 10 p.m.
[01:56:38.175 --> 01:56:39.955]  We're going to have Roger Stone.
[01:56:40.856 --> 01:56:43.397]  We're going to have Laura Loomer, who's set to win her primary in Florida.
[01:56:43.417 --> 01:56:47.039]  We're going to have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes and others tonight, and your calls.
[01:56:47.559 --> 01:56:48.720]  I said, what do we call this?
[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:50.361]  I was thinking of that like an hour ago.
[01:56:50.421 --> 01:56:52.882]  Then I was thinking, what's my next question for Allie Alexander?
[01:56:53.803 --> 01:56:55.584]  And I said, well, how do we stop Civil War II?
[01:56:55.644 --> 01:56:59.385]  Because that's what the deep state, chi-coms, globalists, they don't care that Democrats lose.
[01:56:59.705 --> 01:57:01.686]  They just want to scuttle the economy, kill the dollar.
[01:57:02.666 --> 01:57:04.287]  That's why they're going with this play.
[01:57:04.687 --> 01:57:07.328]  It's because you look at Kamala Harris or Biden, you think, that's the general.
[01:57:07.388 --> 01:57:08.449]  No, that's not even the captain.
[01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:15.631]  That's more like a ringwraith, a zombie, a robot, an automaton that's following orders.
[01:57:16.752 --> 01:57:21.994]  And so tonight we're going to call it Stop Civil War II.
[01:57:24.218 --> 01:57:30.322]  Emergency broadcast or, you know, stop secession Civil War II because it's official.
[01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:32.684]  We saw every major Democrat on TV.
[01:57:32.724 --> 01:57:35.766]  We saw all their surrogates saying Trump's gonna steal it.
[01:57:35.786 --> 01:57:36.767]  We're gonna secede.
[01:57:36.967 --> 01:57:38.688]  We'll have our own inauguration somewhere else.
[01:57:38.728 --> 01:57:39.929]  The military will decide.
[01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:41.870]  You're like, well, that's crazy.
[01:57:41.991 --> 01:57:43.011]  You have a normalcy bias.
[01:57:43.031 --> 01:57:43.632]  They're not gonna do that.
[01:57:44.572 --> 01:57:46.594]  All they do is violate the normalcy bias.
[01:57:48.258 --> 01:57:53.147]  And so I've got a lot of questions in the last 10 minutes with Ali Alexander, great political analyst, smart guy.
[01:57:53.808 --> 01:57:55.531]  He talks to the White House a lot, a lot of other people.
[01:57:56.052 --> 01:57:56.894]  He has his ear to the ground.
[01:57:57.555 --> 01:57:58.917]  But to me, that's number one.
[01:57:59.058 --> 01:58:00.600]  I agree Kamala Harris, terrible pick.
[01:58:01.653 --> 01:58:03.474]  Rejected by progressives, the liberals.
[01:58:03.894 --> 01:58:06.156]  It'll add to Trump's column massively.
[01:58:06.536 --> 01:58:07.537]  But they're not stupid.
[01:58:07.557 --> 01:58:08.917]  The ones behind it aren't stupid.
[01:58:08.937 --> 01:58:11.719]  And they legitimately don't like Trump, want to get rid of him.
[01:58:12.019 --> 01:58:13.340]  Mail-in ballots, all of it.
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:20.064]  So she's the perfect person to cover their attempt to overthrow the election and secession and civil war.
[01:58:20.584 --> 01:58:23.846]  Again, making it about black and white, but this time a total shill.
[01:58:24.207 --> 01:58:25.147]  She's part African.
[01:58:25.207 --> 01:58:25.868]  That's their cover.
[01:58:26.128 --> 01:58:27.148]  That's why they chose her.
[01:58:27.168 --> 01:58:28.169]  She's bought and paid for.
[01:58:28.429 --> 01:58:29.290]  She'll do what she says.
[01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:31.771]  And that tells me they're going to make this move.
[01:58:32.331 --> 01:58:33.051]  What do we do?
[01:58:33.131 --> 01:58:33.931]  What does Trump do?
[01:58:33.991 --> 01:58:34.752]  What do you do?
[01:58:35.032 --> 01:58:35.992]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:58:36.012 --> 01:58:38.633]  Because to me, you're one of the few guys talking about this other than I am.
[01:58:39.173 --> 01:58:40.473]  And for me, this is front and center.
[01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:42.474]  This is their grand strategy right now.
[01:58:42.594 --> 01:58:43.414]  Or am I wrong?
[01:58:43.694 --> 01:58:44.815]  Is there some other strategy?
[01:58:46.035 --> 01:58:48.376]  Your whole life has been leading up to this moment.
[01:58:48.676 --> 01:58:54.418]  My career, which is definitely shorter than yours, has been leading up to this moment.
[01:58:54.478 --> 01:58:55.358]  I mean everything.
[01:58:56.005 --> 01:59:02.011]  Uh, from, from Bill Clinton trying to use Marxist language, you know, what is the definition?
[01:59:02.191 --> 01:59:04.093]  It depends on what is, is, you know?
[01:59:04.113 --> 01:59:06.214]  I think that that's when this nation failed.
[01:59:06.254 --> 01:59:09.517]  You know, a lot of people want to put the blame at, at Barack Obama.
[01:59:09.557 --> 01:59:10.839]  I think that was just gasoline.
[01:59:10.899 --> 01:59:12.740]  I, I've been thinking about this this past week.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.062]  When did America fall?
[01:59:14.882 --> 01:59:16.223]  And can we resurrect her?
[01:59:16.864 --> 01:59:21.768]  And I, I, I've come to the conclusion... I agree, it's the Clintons, it's the Clintons, flaunting lies in our face.
[01:59:22.691 --> 01:59:30.697]  It's the Clintons and this goes back to a lot of things that you've been, you know, Alex, I'm just going to say it, you know, because I, you know, I think people know it in my audience, but let me just say it.
[01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:35.560]  I, my, most of my career, I had been skeptical of things you had said.
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:37.862]  I was like, you're not allowed to go near that guy.
[01:59:37.902 --> 01:59:39.243]  You're not allowed to talk about that guy.
[01:59:39.263 --> 01:59:40.704]  You're not about to link that guy.
[01:59:41.124 --> 01:59:43.426]  And then I remember our mutual friend, Mike Cernovich,
[01:59:44.026 --> 01:59:47.190]  One day asked me in 2018, would you ever go on Alex's show?
[01:59:47.210 --> 01:59:49.853]  And I said, you know, for the first time in my career, I would say yes.
[01:59:49.873 --> 01:59:52.617]  And then I think you had me on in 2018 or 2019.
[01:59:53.298 --> 02:00:00.747]  And I got to tell you, you just can't help but reconcile political theory with the Bible and come to these conclusions that
[02:00:01.307 --> 02:00:04.209]  Oh my gosh, you know, there really is a deep state.
[02:00:04.349 --> 02:00:11.033]  Oh my gosh, the Clintons and the Bushes have a relationship that dates back to Arkansas.
[02:00:11.433 --> 02:00:14.895]  Oh my gosh, when this money goes missing, what is it funding?
[02:00:15.255 --> 02:00:22.299]  Oh my gosh, when Biden looked like he was going to pick Whitmer or Klobuchar, the BLM riots started.
[02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:25.681]  The Soros family boxed Biden into Kamala Harris.
[02:00:25.941 --> 02:00:30.044]  I gotta tell you, it's not lunacy to point out
[02:00:30.624 --> 02:00:38.727]  What looks inevitable unless we wake up the population and what I tell people now is do not be a reactionary.
[02:00:39.067 --> 02:00:41.728]  Do not just say the opposite of the left.
[02:00:41.949 --> 02:00:43.049]  Believe in something.
[02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:44.109]  Believe in order.
[02:00:44.209 --> 02:00:47.911]  Align yourself with God and then fight for that because
[02:00:48.471 --> 02:00:54.232]  What people need to understand, this is the most important thing I'll ever say, is that the Marxists aren't like the left.
[02:00:54.372 --> 02:00:55.852]  It's a spiritual thing for them.
[02:00:56.232 --> 02:00:58.333]  They need to incite division.
[02:00:58.573 --> 02:01:10.655]  There's not enough division on society versus BLM, but there will be enough when, oh, this person dies, this kid dies, this grandma dies, and then we're all pulled into what you call a black hole.
[02:01:10.695 --> 02:01:13.956]  Well, what your viewers need to research is the event horizon.
[02:01:13.976 --> 02:01:14.096]  Yes.
[02:01:15.236 --> 02:01:22.261]  We are meters, mere meters away from an event horizon that will pull us all into a legitimate civil strife.
[02:01:22.521 --> 02:01:23.722]  Right now it's illegitimate.
[02:01:23.782 --> 02:01:26.103]  It's optics, it's- No, no, I agree.
[02:01:26.123 --> 02:01:28.225]  People on Twitter are like, Jones looks like crap.
[02:01:28.545 --> 02:01:29.546]  Yeah, I can't sleep.
[02:01:29.666 --> 02:01:30.346]  I'm stressed out.
[02:01:30.626 --> 02:01:31.527]  And they're all laughing.
[02:01:31.567 --> 02:01:32.307]  They think it's funny.
[02:01:32.448 --> 02:01:32.788]  I agree.
[02:01:33.328 --> 02:01:38.193]  My whole life's built towards this, yours... I'm just like, how do we stop this?
[02:01:38.473 --> 02:01:45.280]  We're watching everything like the Titanic going towards an iceberg and the people that are going to drown first are laughing about it.
[02:01:47.044 --> 02:01:49.345]  I got three hours of sleep last night.
[02:01:49.385 --> 02:01:51.946]  I didn't even shave this morning.
[02:01:52.486 --> 02:01:59.489]  I share your pain and what I want to tell people is, look, I've been a Southern Baptist Christian for 20 years.
[02:02:00.289 --> 02:02:04.891]  I'm probably going to become Catholic or Orthodox, but I will tell you, this is what I want to tell people.
[02:02:05.572 --> 02:02:07.274]  Study the color revolutions.
[02:02:07.834 --> 02:02:10.317]  Study the pre-Civil War of America.
[02:02:10.637 --> 02:02:13.279]  Catholics, study Our Lady of Fatima.
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:17.143]  And then evangelicals, study Revelation very closely.
[02:02:17.423 --> 02:02:21.507]  And what I say is this, when all these people... It all comes together the same message.
[02:02:21.547 --> 02:02:22.608]  It all comes together.
[02:02:22.908 --> 02:02:24.430]  And I gotta tell you,
[02:02:25.126 --> 02:02:28.729]  We must ask for God's intervention, and we must walk blindly in faith.
[02:02:28.930 --> 02:02:29.590]  Well, you said it.
[02:02:30.291 --> 02:02:31.692]  The globalists are Satanists.
[02:02:31.972 --> 02:02:32.693]  They're out in the open.
[02:02:32.713 --> 02:02:33.974]  They're calling on Satan.
[02:02:34.415 --> 02:02:36.376]  The one thing they don't want to do is to call on Christ.
[02:02:37.217 --> 02:02:37.658]  They are.
[02:02:37.858 --> 02:02:38.939]  Think about this, Alex.
[02:02:38.959 --> 02:02:40.500]  You've been in this for more than 25 years.
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:41.842]  I've been in this for 13 years.
[02:02:42.162 --> 02:02:47.947]  Have we ever seen this many witch covens pray and curse and hex together?
[02:02:47.967 --> 02:02:48.007]  No.
[02:02:49.202 --> 02:02:53.486]  Have we ever seen this many random blood sacrifices in forests?
[02:02:53.506 --> 02:02:58.371]  Well, General Flynn came out and said it is Satan manifesting through communists.
[02:02:58.631 --> 02:02:59.773]  We must call on Christ.
[02:03:00.253 --> 02:03:00.713]  It's there.
[02:03:01.664 --> 02:03:19.360]  It's there, and I have, the encouraging thing is this, I have hundreds of atheists, hundreds of atheists DMing me on Twitter and Instagram and my personal website, olliealexander.org, and they're like, I don't know that I believe in God, but what you're saying is lining up with reality.
[02:03:19.621 --> 02:03:20.622]  What do I need to read?
[02:03:20.702 --> 02:03:21.683]  What do I need to study?
[02:03:21.703 --> 02:03:24.705]  Yeah, world government forced chips to buy and sell.
[02:03:24.725 --> 02:03:26.067]  I mean, it's all happening.
[02:03:27.483 --> 02:03:35.210]  It's all happening, and all we gotta do is call out their clown world, and then the general public.
[02:03:35.530 --> 02:03:38.513]  They love to do these things in plain sight and secret.
[02:03:38.913 --> 02:03:48.121]  And when you make their plain sight secret, and when you make their secret out in the open, when you invert their inversion, then they go away for 50 years.
[02:03:48.161 --> 02:03:50.303]  No, I agree, because their inversion, you flip it, it's the truth.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:53.281]  Right, and Satan knows the truth.
[02:03:53.301 --> 02:03:54.101]  He's got a big secret.
[02:03:54.141 --> 02:03:55.062]  This is very esoteric.
[02:03:55.722 --> 02:03:58.223]  We aren't as ancient evil beings Satan is.
[02:03:58.243 --> 02:03:59.924]  We're a little bit younger and more powerful, but younger.
[02:04:00.664 --> 02:04:04.886]  Satan knows the truth, so he always flips it, because that has power of the truth.
[02:04:05.287 --> 02:04:07.207]  So we flip what they've done.
[02:04:07.268 --> 02:04:08.228]  It's the exact truth.
[02:04:08.488 --> 02:04:10.809]  There's power in just flipping what they've done.
[02:04:11.049 --> 02:04:12.570]  They have power in flipping what we've done.
[02:04:12.910 --> 02:04:16.432]  Our power is just flipping what they did, and that is what's going on.
[02:04:17.287 --> 02:04:19.609]  Right, and that's why God calls us to obedience.
[02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:33.760]  And look, you and I, we may engage in some sinning, and that's why you repent, and that's why you work to become more obedient, because all it does is it aligns your soul and your body with the Kingdom of Heaven.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.601]  And so that's what repentance is about.
[02:04:35.701 --> 02:04:39.124]  That's what obedience is about, is having that clarity where, oh my gosh!
[02:04:39.144 --> 02:04:41.266]  It's saying, I want to realign, I'm sorry for what I did.
[02:04:42.026 --> 02:04:44.329]  King David had his people killed to get their wives.
[02:04:44.589 --> 02:04:45.410]  He was sorry later.
[02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.910]  It was real.
[02:04:46.151 --> 02:04:47.472]  God knew that alignment was real.
[02:04:47.712 --> 02:04:49.074]  It wasn't some form of magic.
[02:04:49.374 --> 02:04:52.738]  It wasn't he was getting atonement or a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[02:04:52.778 --> 02:04:54.700]  He was really sad and God took him back.
[02:04:55.782 --> 02:05:04.491]  Yeah, it's wanting to see the vision of the future, and that's why we're able to predict some of these things, and we're able to say, hey, the timeline's moving this way, the timeline's moving this way.
[02:05:04.972 --> 02:05:15.263]  The thing that I'll end with is that, you know, go back to the Archbishop Viganò's letter to Donald Trump where he talks about the deep state and the deep church, and research Kamala Harris
[02:05:15.703 --> 02:05:19.847]  Who was shilling for what's called the Velvet Mafia in the Catholic Church.
[02:05:19.867 --> 02:05:26.654]  And what you need to understand is that the very end, the Latin phrase of Vigano's letter is what is absolutely happening.
[02:05:26.714 --> 02:05:28.275]  I don't speak Latin.
[02:05:28.355 --> 02:05:29.136]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:05:29.176 --> 02:05:31.078]  We've got our next guest host, Jay Dyer, coming up.
[02:05:31.118 --> 02:05:31.659]  Two minute break.
[02:05:31.999 --> 02:05:32.760]  Finish up on this.
[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:33.620]  This is really important.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:34.181]  Five more minutes.
[02:05:34.201 --> 02:05:35.102]  Raleigh Alexander.
[02:05:35.122 --> 02:05:35.903]  And I'll tell listeners this.
[02:05:36.755 --> 02:05:38.175]  Tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:05:38.195 --> 02:05:38.776]  Warriman's at 6.
[02:05:39.016 --> 02:05:39.836]  We have an hour to break.
[02:05:39.936 --> 02:05:43.437]  I'll be back with Roger Stone with huge breaking news at 7 p.m.
[02:05:43.457 --> 02:05:43.797]  Central.
[02:05:43.837 --> 02:05:47.098]  Share those live links from band.video, newswars.com.
[02:05:47.458 --> 02:05:49.979]  Only way they get out is you.
[02:05:50.399 --> 02:05:51.980]  Commercial-free tonight.
[02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:52.760]  Three hours.
[02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:53.680]  We'll be doing this more and more.
[02:05:53.961 --> 02:05:55.061]  Thanks for building InfoWars.
[02:05:55.301 --> 02:05:56.381]  We'll be back with hour number four.
[02:05:56.481 --> 02:05:57.802]  Five more minutes with Ali Alexander.
[02:05:59.502 --> 02:06:04.464]  All right, Ali Alexander just intrigued me because I remember when the big Archbishop came out and says the fight between good and evil.
[02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:07.781]  So what would people, you know,
[02:06:30.441 --> 02:06:31.082]  You know what?
[02:06:45.752 --> 02:06:55.377]  In 13 years of doing hundreds of panels and interviews, you introduced me the best when you're like, here's an insider who wants the outside, the barbarians, to know what's going on inside the castle.
[02:06:55.857 --> 02:07:00.480]  And what I'll say is I've been waiting for this moment, hoping it would never come.
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:06.623]  So there is urgency in the now and what people need to know, and I don't want to like explode brains too much, is
[02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:19.776]  Archbishop Viganò's letter to Donald Trump, which Donald Trump then retweeted out, needs to be read, understanding that there is a public meaning and a private secret.
[02:07:19.836 --> 02:07:26.999]  And at the very end of that letter, there is a Latin phrase, and I don't speak Latin, so I'm going to butcher it a little, but it's Solve et Coagula.
[02:07:27.699 --> 02:07:31.141]  And what it means is to dissolve and recongeal.
[02:07:31.601 --> 02:07:35.363]  And what you need to understand is that the sum of Alex's work,
[02:07:37.063 --> 02:07:44.447]  In studying, you know, this secret society or this Marxist group or that group or that group is to this end.
[02:07:44.827 --> 02:07:46.648]  It is in service of Satan.
[02:07:46.928 --> 02:07:48.749]  And as you pointed out, Satan is older than us.
[02:07:49.029 --> 02:07:53.731]  He has always sought to have humanly servants that will
[02:07:54.628 --> 02:08:03.936]  Dissolve things, invert things, change meanings of words, that's why they must change words first, and then reform it and put it back together.
[02:08:04.176 --> 02:08:09.180]  That's why you never see the leftists completely abolish anything that they say.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:11.702]  They never abolish inequality.
[02:08:11.902 --> 02:08:13.424]  They never abolish money.
[02:08:13.664 --> 02:08:15.245]  They never abolish class.
[02:08:15.445 --> 02:08:17.447]  They never abolish the military.
[02:08:17.767 --> 02:08:18.928]  They recongeal it.
[02:08:19.229 --> 02:08:20.690]  And what Vigano is pointing out,
[02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:25.852]  Is that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, remember Joe Biden professes to be a Catholic.
[02:08:26.392 --> 02:08:34.034]  Kamala Harris gave Catholic priests who were fondling children a pass while she was Attorney General.
[02:08:34.334 --> 02:08:43.577]  It's the Velvet Mafia and what people need to understand is that our institutions, the American government and the Catholic Church are being infiltrated and that's why people need to
[02:08:44.488 --> 02:08:50.611]  You know, research Dr. Taylor Marshall on YouTube, he's done an extensive video on this infiltration of the Catholic Church.
[02:08:50.651 --> 02:08:55.413]  But Vigano says, no, there is a deep church and a deep state and they work together.
[02:08:55.653 --> 02:08:58.695]  And it's all coming to the precipice in November.
[02:09:00.455 --> 02:09:06.818]  We are at that moment where I'd gladly lose my Twitter account right now to tell people, wake up.
[02:09:07.278 --> 02:09:10.420]  We're at a top three moment in human history.
[02:09:12.267 --> 02:09:15.893]  And there have been times they've taken your Twitter account down and they're doing it to so many other people right now.
[02:09:16.843 --> 02:09:21.545]  Yeah, yeah, I've been permanently suspended before, and you know, I've used my relationships to get it back.
[02:09:22.205 --> 02:09:29.647]  But, you know, I know the time is coming where, you know, I will join you and Gavin and Laura and Roger in the dark alleys.
[02:09:29.707 --> 02:09:37.590]  But I think the time is also coming where these centralized platforms, they either win and we lose, or we win and we decentralize the internet.
[02:09:37.610 --> 02:09:37.830]  No, I agree.
[02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:40.651]  We're coming down to the battle of the gods right now, the good or the wrong.
[02:09:40.711 --> 02:09:44.512]  I mean, this is one of those times that happens every few hundred years, every thousand years.
[02:09:44.892 --> 02:09:46.213]  This is the super event.
[02:09:46.673 --> 02:09:51.198]  And then this election just leads to the cascade, because even if Trump wins, they're going to go crazy.
[02:09:51.238 --> 02:09:52.900]  I mean, the battle just begun.
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:58.687]  It's like when Roger was so happy on election night four years ago, and I said, Roger, the war just begun.
[02:09:58.847 --> 02:09:59.488]  He knows now.
[02:09:59.548 --> 02:10:02.331]  I said, Matt, are you ready to put you in prison?
[02:10:02.351 --> 02:10:03.573]  He goes, oh, we got the president.
[02:10:03.613 --> 02:10:04.254]  I said, get ready.
[02:10:05.384 --> 02:10:05.824]  Get ready.
[02:10:06.244 --> 02:10:09.025]  I mean, they've infiltrated even the good.
[02:10:09.486 --> 02:10:11.887]  Remember, they can't create a contrast with us.
[02:10:11.907 --> 02:10:15.768]  They must infiltrate us in order to deceive our believers.
[02:10:15.808 --> 02:10:16.228]  That's right.
[02:10:16.428 --> 02:10:17.129]  Come back soon.
[02:10:17.169 --> 02:10:17.809]  Don't wait a year.
[02:10:17.849 --> 02:10:22.011]  Come back and get into the election and all the stuff coming out and more on Kamala Harris.
[02:10:22.031 --> 02:10:23.271]  I know you're ready to expose her.
[02:10:23.291 --> 02:10:23.911]  We didn't get that today.
[02:10:24.191 --> 02:10:24.952]  Come back next week.
[02:10:25.232 --> 02:10:26.452]  Ali Alexander, thank you so much.
[02:10:26.512 --> 02:10:27.133]  Very impressed.
[02:10:27.613 --> 02:10:29.314]  At ALI on Twitter.
[02:10:29.654 --> 02:10:32.695]  We'll be back with Jay Dyer and Sam Hyde, the comedian.
[02:10:33.075 --> 02:10:35.797]  They take over in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:10:37.337 --> 02:10:39.679]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:39.699 --> 02:10:41.960]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:49.384]  You know, I was on here a couple months ago for the first time and I said some strange, enigmatic, mysterious phrases.
[02:10:50.345 --> 02:10:59.533]  I prophesized, I said test tube, gub gub, snail man, micromachines, and some people were mystified by this, but I was predicting the future.
[02:10:59.553 --> 02:11:06.939]  I was predicting the one, the only, the legend of trolling, Mr. Samuel Hyde, is joining us today.
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:15.066]  And before I mention that, before I get into that, I wanted to say that, you know, I thought that I was a legend of trolling at one time.
[02:11:15.247 --> 02:11:17.649]  When I was in high school, we actually arranged a kind of a,
[02:11:18.810 --> 02:11:29.957]  A black operation, you could say, in high school, high school black ops, where we wanted to upseat the existing order by electing a beautiful slow boy to class president.
[02:11:30.357 --> 02:11:31.258]  And that's a true story.
[02:11:31.298 --> 02:11:34.640]  The cheerleaders, Mean Girls Brigade, were furious.
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:41.324]  And I thought that I had mastered something of trolling, but I realized that in the big leagues, I was nothing.
[02:11:41.644 --> 02:11:47.268]  I was, I was, I myself was a test tube, gub, gub, snail man, micromachine of trolling.
[02:11:47.868 --> 02:11:59.054]  And today I have the master, the, probably the, as Alex said, top of the totem pole of comedy for everyone, perhaps 40 and under, Mr. Sam High.
[02:11:59.094 --> 02:11:59.674]  Sam, are you there?
[02:12:00.895 --> 02:12:01.415]  Can you see me?
[02:12:03.276 --> 02:12:03.596]  Hey!
[02:12:04.097 --> 02:12:05.958]  Can you hear me?
[02:12:06.938 --> 02:12:07.859]  I can hear you, yes.
[02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:10.320]  That beautiful, smoky voice is coming through.
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:11.680]  I gotta finish reading.
[02:12:11.841 --> 02:12:14.342]  I'm on the last page of my favorite book right now.
[02:12:15.578 --> 02:12:16.138]  Hold on, is it?
[02:12:16.278 --> 02:12:17.038]  God damn, man.
[02:12:17.158 --> 02:12:17.519]  One second.
[02:12:17.559 --> 02:12:20.760]  Let me just change the background.
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:22.060]  Choose background effect.
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:23.940]  There we go.
[02:12:24.081 --> 02:12:24.361]  Okay.
[02:12:25.081 --> 02:12:28.162]  I just had to, I gotta finish reading the last page of my favorite book.
[02:12:28.822 --> 02:12:29.522]  Just kidding.
[02:12:33.083 --> 02:12:34.183]  Oh, just kidding.
[02:12:34.844 --> 02:12:35.284]  Oh my God.
[02:12:37.841 --> 02:12:39.222]  Thank you for saying these, by the way.
[02:12:39.282 --> 02:12:40.422]  They're very entertaining.
[02:12:40.442 --> 02:12:42.864]  The master troll trolled me on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:42.904 --> 02:12:43.965]  This is epic.
[02:12:44.045 --> 02:12:50.508]  Well, they'd be more entertaining if they weren't so packed with disturbing realities.
[02:12:51.909 --> 02:12:56.332]  One second, let me just get back in Elon Musk's private AI chamber.
[02:12:56.412 --> 02:12:57.252]  Okay, hey, I'm back.
[02:12:58.033 --> 02:12:59.214]  We're using teleportation now.
[02:12:59.234 --> 02:13:02.996]  I don't know if you know that's real, but teleportation's... Are you back in the AI chamber there with the Kumbots?
[02:13:03.016 --> 02:13:03.176]  Yeah.
[02:13:04.147 --> 02:13:14.552]  Yes, we're researching new ways to coomb, new unnatural, freakish ways to genetically modify your testicles to make your orgasm ten times more powerful.
[02:13:15.432 --> 02:13:16.273]  Alright, Sam.
[02:13:17.413 --> 02:13:17.733]  Sorry.
[02:13:18.494 --> 02:13:20.515]  Sam, slow down, slow down.
[02:13:20.535 --> 02:13:21.355]  You're going to blow our minds.
[02:13:22.016 --> 02:13:24.077]  Tell us, let's get back to the origins.
[02:13:24.237 --> 02:13:29.779]  What are the origins of Sam Hyde, his influences, his comedic prowess?
[02:13:29.879 --> 02:13:31.040]  Where do you come from?
[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:32.961]  Who inspired you?
[02:13:35.413 --> 02:13:40.975]  Um, this is not a joke, I seriously just swallowed this wrong.
[02:13:42.156 --> 02:13:42.636]  One second.
[02:13:45.037 --> 02:13:45.817]  Give me like one second.
[02:13:51.859 --> 02:13:52.660]  Okay, all better.
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:55.260]  So I'm really sorry about that, it's unprofessional.
[02:13:56.781 --> 02:14:04.484]  Well let me ask you something, because I need to know, before we do battle and debate, because I'm an atheist technological
[02:14:05.154 --> 02:14:06.214]  No, I'm just kidding.
[02:14:06.234 --> 02:14:11.277]  But I want to size you up and know... God!
[02:14:11.477 --> 02:14:12.597]  I seriously took that in the lungs.
[02:14:13.418 --> 02:14:14.438]  What kind of man you are?
[02:14:14.478 --> 02:14:18.240]  So I want to know, are you a Burt's Bees strawberry man?
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:20.781]  Or are you a vanilla bean man?
[02:14:21.781 --> 02:14:22.962]  Are you more of a classic man?
[02:14:22.982 --> 02:14:23.902]  This is important, by the way.
[02:14:24.782 --> 02:14:25.843]  Or are you a honey man?
[02:14:26.923 --> 02:14:28.344]  Or wait, are you a peppermint man?
[02:14:30.024 --> 02:14:31.085]  Are you a strawberry man?
[02:14:31.265 --> 02:14:31.745]  That's a dupe.
[02:14:32.405 --> 02:14:33.346]  Are you pumpkin spice?
[02:14:34.482 --> 02:14:38.365]  Are you more of a cucumber mint style or would you call yourself wild cherry?
[02:14:38.405 --> 02:14:41.928]  Now, the thing people don't know about wild cherry, it stains your lips red.
[02:14:42.549 --> 02:14:47.273]  That's a price you might have to be willing to pay because it is technically the best flavor.
[02:14:47.313 --> 02:14:48.634]  Now, I'll tell you my answer.
[02:14:48.654 --> 02:14:49.194]  What's your answer?
[02:14:50.075 --> 02:14:50.515]  Go with your gut.
[02:14:51.837 --> 02:14:53.438]  My immediate reaction is that
[02:14:54.861 --> 02:15:00.483]  That soy mean face, but probably my fiancée does lip gloss.
[02:15:00.603 --> 02:15:03.104]  So I just use whatever lip gloss she's got laying around.
[02:15:03.164 --> 02:15:04.364]  So no Burt's Bees for me.
[02:15:05.184 --> 02:15:06.385]  Solid answer, solid answer.
[02:15:06.425 --> 02:15:08.565]  Lip gloss, sometimes superior case.
[02:15:08.625 --> 02:15:09.766]  I'm cucumber mint myself.
[02:15:09.806 --> 02:15:10.386]  Hold on a second.
[02:15:11.046 --> 02:15:11.426]  I knew it.
[02:15:11.866 --> 02:15:12.046]  Yeah.
[02:15:12.206 --> 02:15:12.646]  Cucumbers.
[02:15:12.666 --> 02:15:12.947]  I'm sorry.
[02:15:12.987 --> 02:15:13.327]  I'm not.
[02:15:14.607 --> 02:15:14.847]  I'm not.
[02:15:15.367 --> 02:15:16.027]  I shouldn't.
[02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:17.728]  I'm a little nervous right now.
[02:15:18.728 --> 02:15:20.889]  I've never been in front of this many eyeballs.
[02:15:23.431 --> 02:15:25.493]  Sam, tell us your origins and your influence.
[02:15:25.733 --> 02:15:26.494]  Where do you come from?
[02:15:28.095 --> 02:15:28.656]  I don't know, man.
[02:15:28.696 --> 02:15:32.959]  I've been, I guess for influences, you know the show Wonder Chosen?
[02:15:34.701 --> 02:15:35.602]  You ever hear of Wonder Chosen?
[02:15:36.783 --> 02:15:40.626]  I think if there was one comedic influence that did the most for me, it would be Wonder Chosen.
[02:15:42.187 --> 02:15:46.671]  And there was also a collection of cartoons back in the day called Liquid Television.
[02:15:47.171 --> 02:15:48.533]  And both of those, I think those are important.
[02:15:50.089 --> 02:15:58.234]  I think those are important because the aesthetics, to me, has always been more interesting than the content, which is weird to say.
[02:15:59.095 --> 02:16:11.923]  But the kind of vaporwave stuff you do, I think the dressing, the stylization of things, there's an importance there.
[02:16:12.143 --> 02:16:13.984]  And it's easy to get wrapped up in
[02:16:15.663 --> 02:16:21.828]  In going with aesthetics in a way that's like vain or doesn't have substance behind it.
[02:16:22.269 --> 02:16:29.455]  I think combining substance with finely honed aesthetics has been what's always kind of interested me.
[02:16:29.495 --> 02:16:31.617]  So most of my influences are aesthetic influences.
[02:16:31.637 --> 02:16:35.260]  80s anime, 90s anime, that kind of stuff.
[02:16:36.041 --> 02:16:42.186]  Yeah, I remember you used to watch Liquid Television and I was always entranced by Aeon Flux and she was always like,
[02:16:43.573 --> 02:16:44.754]  You know, doing things with nipples.
[02:16:44.794 --> 02:16:46.556]  It was an obsession with nipples in that show.
[02:16:46.596 --> 02:16:48.478]  And it always weirded me out, even though I love the art.
[02:16:48.579 --> 02:16:54.385]  But what was great about liquid television was that it was like a variety show and they would they would offer
[02:16:55.237 --> 02:17:00.380]  Actually creative, you know, stuff going on in alternative art at the time.
[02:17:01.841 --> 02:17:02.681]  There's nothing like that.
[02:17:02.721 --> 02:17:04.462]  Like it was there for a while, it went away.
[02:17:05.282 --> 02:17:08.684]  And I see you, yes, as definitely a successor to that.
[02:17:10.585 --> 02:17:12.726]  You went to art school, you know, you did this kind of stuff.
[02:17:12.746 --> 02:17:14.847]  You had to deal with the art hoes at art school.
[02:17:15.048 --> 02:17:16.929]  You did some great comedy about them art hoes.
[02:17:17.709 --> 02:17:19.710]  How did you get through art school without going crazy?
[02:17:21.405 --> 02:17:43.279]  I think that's when I started to think seriously about the distribution of resources and about the sort of the puerile notion that most people have when they're like 12 years old, when they start to think about government and how things should be distributed and seeing the inefficiency and the
[02:17:44.737 --> 02:17:46.918]  Yeah, I had a similar experience.
[02:17:47.038 --> 02:17:47.678]  I didn't blow that much.
[02:18:07.350 --> 02:18:07.670]  Wow.
[02:18:08.511 --> 02:18:26.246]  I did blow quite a bit though on grad school and in the middle of grad school I realized that I'm paying this D-bag liberal guy to tell me that I can get a piece of paper and that he who hates me will allow me to go and talk about the things that I actually knew better than that guy.
[02:18:26.407 --> 02:18:26.847]  You know what I mean?
[02:18:26.907 --> 02:18:30.230]  It's like this is totally a scam and brainwashing by the way.
[02:18:31.224 --> 02:18:43.651]  It's such an insane waste of money, because that amount of money, you know, you can use that to start not just one business, I mean, it depends on what kind of business you're trying to start, but that's like, that's startup capital for fucking, oh, sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:18:44.252 --> 02:18:47.053]  That's startup capital for effing 10 businesses, you know?
[02:18:47.394 --> 02:18:58.000]  And that's across the entire country, all those people, I mean, if you want to help, if you're one of these people that wants to, if you want to do good, if you want to be charitable,
[02:18:59.053 --> 02:19:06.057]  Look at the waste of money that's happening in colleges and think about what that money could do.
[02:19:06.157 --> 02:19:14.602]  Dwight Eisenhower has his quote about... Man, I'm too scatterbrained for this podcasting stuff.
[02:19:14.622 --> 02:19:15.703]  This is one reason why I don't do it.
[02:19:16.023 --> 02:19:24.448]  When he was railing against the military-industrial complex and talking about how one B-52 bomber is like the cost of a hospital, that kind of thing.
[02:19:26.809 --> 02:19:38.420]  There's so many people who are concerned with helping society, but they're unwilling to look for inefficiency in these hallowed institutions.
[02:19:40.504 --> 02:19:55.951]  Before we get to Paradigm Shift, which was kind of an epic troll, I want to take us out to the break and mention that if you want to follow Sam's work, you can go to mde.tv to get access to his content.
[02:19:56.091 --> 02:19:58.372]  My work is at jaysanalysis.com.
[02:19:58.892 --> 02:20:02.294]  You can find my books, my subscription, and all that there.
[02:20:02.314 --> 02:20:06.656]  And when we come back, we're going to get into some of the most epic trolling probably ever.
[02:20:07.177 --> 02:20:11.239]  If you've seen the Yes Men, you can think about those kinds of trolling events.
[02:20:11.299 --> 02:20:15.962]  But I think this one even topped that one by making fun of the whole TED Talk phenomena.
[02:20:16.022 --> 02:20:18.523]  So when we come back, we'll get into that with Sam Hyde.
[02:20:18.923 --> 02:20:20.604]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.684 --> 02:20:26.707]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, with our good friend Sam Hyde.
[02:20:28.049 --> 02:20:35.037]  Yeah, when I first saw TED Talks, you know, back in the early 2000s, I remember seeing the first one actually was not bad.
[02:20:35.077 --> 02:20:38.761]  It was something about, like, symbols and geometry and nature.
[02:20:38.781 --> 02:20:39.962]  And I was like, oh, this is pretty cool.
[02:20:40.002 --> 02:20:43.225]  And then I click on the next TED Talk, and it's like some
[02:20:44.958 --> 02:20:50.182]  Witchy woman saying, uh, we have more, uh, more men.
[02:20:50.202 --> 02:20:54.025]  Uh, we have more women graduating from college than men now.
[02:20:54.145 --> 02:20:55.946]  And women are more men than man.
[02:20:55.966 --> 02:20:58.728]  And, and, and then on to click on the next one, it's Bill Gates.
[02:20:58.788 --> 02:21:00.709]  And he's talking about, we got to get the numbers down.
[02:21:00.729 --> 02:21:03.211]  We got to get the numbers down.
[02:21:03.271 --> 02:21:04.592]  Eat your own doodoo.
[02:21:05.113 --> 02:21:05.833]  Drink the poo water.
[02:21:05.853 --> 02:21:10.436]  How did you start with this epic troll of Paradigm Shift where you trolled Ted Talk?
[02:21:10.476 --> 02:21:11.217]  Can you tell us about that?
[02:21:12.236 --> 02:21:21.622]  I'm sure you've talked about this before, Bill Gates' fixation on getting people to drink pee and drink their doo-doo water.
[02:21:22.002 --> 02:21:23.523]  That's so insane.
[02:21:24.284 --> 02:21:25.945]  I'll get to your question in a second.
[02:21:25.965 --> 02:21:29.187]  Oh yeah, like how we're going to make feces into meat, this kind of stuff.
[02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:31.288]  Dude, this is the thing.
[02:21:31.308 --> 02:21:32.409]  I'm not actually
[02:21:37.836 --> 02:21:38.677]  All that racist.
[02:21:38.757 --> 02:21:41.039]  I'm probably as racist as most people are.
[02:21:41.059 --> 02:21:43.161]  I'm probably as racist as most black people are.
[02:21:43.782 --> 02:21:48.946]  And there are things that happen to black people that are, like, mind-blowing.
[02:21:49.667 --> 02:21:54.832]  Like, the human guinea pig stuff in Africa is so insane.
[02:21:56.193 --> 02:22:00.417]  And to Bill Gates, like, test it, it's almost like, um...
[02:22:01.452 --> 02:22:03.153]  The stuff they're doing is so evil.
[02:22:03.213 --> 02:22:10.755]  It's almost like if you had a video game and the point of the video game was to be as evil as possible to as many black people in Africa as possible.
[02:22:12.436 --> 02:22:18.938]  And then making it so that they're trying to get it so they're drinking urine and feces.
[02:22:20.459 --> 02:22:24.680]  That's the most insane, evil thing, man.
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:25.720]  Never mind the
[02:22:28.101 --> 02:22:32.863]  10-fold increase in population from human aid, etc.
[02:22:33.263 --> 02:22:37.665]  Never mind the vaccination experiments and the AIDS and all this other stuff.
[02:22:37.706 --> 02:22:40.907]  The icing on the cake, that's how you know someone's really evil.
[02:22:41.147 --> 02:22:42.468]  It's not just a pragmatic thing.
[02:22:42.508 --> 02:22:47.330]  It's not just trying to bring about some future world scenario.
[02:22:47.370 --> 02:22:49.371]  It's not like, oh, we need to do this to get to the...
[02:22:49.693 --> 02:22:51.374]  The means justify the end.
[02:22:51.394 --> 02:22:52.234]  We have to get here.
[02:22:52.274 --> 02:22:53.354]  We have to get to the future.
[02:22:53.714 --> 02:22:56.135]  And injecting these blacks is very important to do.
[02:22:56.535 --> 02:23:02.677]  Like, you know it's absolutely evil when he's like, OK, now we're going to make poo-poo cakes.
[02:23:04.637 --> 02:23:08.919]  It's intentionally puerile.
[02:23:08.979 --> 02:23:10.879]  It's an intentional, like the dog.
[02:23:10.919 --> 02:23:12.119]  Rub the dog in the face.
[02:23:12.220 --> 02:23:14.120]  You know, his face in the mess.
[02:23:18.206 --> 02:23:22.350]  I don't mean to appear callous, like laughing so much, it's just that it's so insane and twisted.
[02:23:22.430 --> 02:23:24.732]  It doesn't sound real.
[02:23:24.792 --> 02:23:26.194]  It's not even out of science fiction.
[02:23:26.254 --> 02:23:27.255]  It's beyond that.
[02:23:28.176 --> 02:23:32.239]  If a science fiction writer wrote something like that, you'd be like, oh, this is disturbing.
[02:23:32.380 --> 02:23:33.421]  I don't want to read this anymore.
[02:23:33.861 --> 02:23:38.966]  There's not that many ideas like this in great science fiction.
[02:23:39.046 --> 02:23:40.307]  It's just so insane.
[02:23:43.945 --> 02:23:49.810]  Gil Bates had already done his TED Talks, and then you did your troll of the TED Talk.
[02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:51.110]  Can you tell us how that came about?
[02:23:52.572 --> 02:23:55.254]  It's just like, you know, watching TED Talks, because there's some good TED Talks.
[02:23:55.334 --> 02:24:01.198]  It's like there's usually something interesting you can glean from most of them.
[02:24:01.338 --> 02:24:02.019]  There's always something.
[02:24:02.139 --> 02:24:07.303]  Someone will say something that's interesting, and it'll be worth skimming through for 20 minutes on double speed or whatever.
[02:24:08.063 --> 02:24:09.625]  But just the...
[02:24:11.027 --> 02:24:28.836]  It's the sort of Reddit atheist science-scientism, like, taking all of human knowledge and all of the scientific method, balling it up into this, like, cool little robot guy and says, for science!
[02:24:29.176 --> 02:24:30.857]  For Eureka!
[02:24:31.158 --> 02:24:36.820]  And, like, fetishizing and, like, people who don't have
[02:24:39.008 --> 02:24:56.234]  The ability to go through a scientific paper, not saying I have that ability either, but people who just have no understanding and they look at these like gleaming, the promise of gleaming rockets and the promise of tasty vaccines and thinking that like,
[02:24:56.963 --> 02:24:59.445]  This is the new God, or something like that.
[02:24:59.765 --> 02:25:03.328]  And that's sort of the vibe that I got from TED Talks.
[02:25:03.348 --> 02:25:10.454]  The guy that organizes TED Talks, I forget what his name is, it's some slightly fruity-sounding name, Christophorus, something like that.
[02:25:10.814 --> 02:25:12.775]  But he comes on stage with like an Asian-style
[02:25:14.145 --> 02:25:15.926]  No, no collar shirt.
[02:25:16.447 --> 02:25:38.543]  And whenever he does make an appearance on stage, when the Ted Talk is interesting enough and important enough and high level enough for him to come on stage and like thank the person, he's always like very, he's got this like weird kind of air of humility, like he's talking to the Pope or something, like he'll come up and like, shake the hand like it's a precious
[02:25:39.427 --> 02:25:41.249]  This is the most precious handshake.
[02:25:41.589 --> 02:25:42.410]  You are a prophet.
[02:25:42.450 --> 02:25:45.193]  You are leading us in the new way.
[02:25:45.253 --> 02:25:45.813]  That kind of thing.
[02:25:46.054 --> 02:25:52.540]  So I just thought it was a sphere that was ripe for some kind of prank like that.
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:54.962]  To be fair, what I did was a TEDx talk.
[02:25:55.002 --> 02:25:59.026]  It wasn't a TED talk, so it was less thoroughly vetted, but I think I got the point across.
[02:26:00.362 --> 02:26:01.263]  It still worked, yeah.
[02:26:01.383 --> 02:26:05.208]  I mean, and this was not that long ago.
[02:26:05.929 --> 02:26:10.675]  You're the sort of the beefy, somebody said you look like a built Leon Trotsky.
[02:26:11.176 --> 02:26:15.261]  So you were already the buff Leon Trotsky Sam Hyde there at that point.
[02:26:16.118 --> 02:26:17.139]  Thank you.
[02:26:18.099 --> 02:26:19.179]  You have Million Dollar Extreme.
[02:26:19.199 --> 02:26:22.101]  Do you want to get into the drama of the cancellation?
[02:26:22.141 --> 02:26:27.283]  Because you were like the pioneer of the deplatforming cancel culture stuff for comedy.
[02:26:27.303 --> 02:26:30.885]  You were before the media stuff, the alt media and all that.
[02:26:31.545 --> 02:26:32.386]  They went for comedy.
[02:26:32.406 --> 02:26:32.926]  They went for you.
[02:26:34.051 --> 02:26:53.238]  Yeah, well, I think the key thing that sort of set us up for targeting is we were kind of like the last remaining, not like white power, but like white group of white guys not acting like fruity little apologizing
[02:26:55.415 --> 02:26:55.795]  Yeah.
[02:26:55.875 --> 02:27:00.576]  The way that other white guys in entertainment sort of have to act, you know what I mean?
[02:27:01.136 --> 02:27:11.998]  And it was just very strong and unapologetic and high octane and I think it was, I understand why it was threatening, especially with the Jews rock sketch.
[02:27:13.078 --> 02:27:15.399]  I can see why they took issue with that.
[02:27:17.799 --> 02:27:20.960]  Yeah, and you guys had
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:24.423]  High ratings, I think you had what, a million or two?
[02:27:25.624 --> 02:27:29.908]  Yeah, we broke a million views on I think the first and last episodes.
[02:27:29.948 --> 02:27:36.975]  We were number two for not just Adult Swim, which wouldn't be that impressive, but for Late Night Cable.
[02:27:36.995 --> 02:27:40.539]  I forget what the rankings were, but we killed it.
[02:27:42.681 --> 02:27:47.764]  Creative head of the network, Mike Lazo, he said, he said, we're gonna shoot a hundred more episodes.
[02:27:48.185 --> 02:27:49.486]  You guys are the next Tim and Eric.
[02:27:49.506 --> 02:27:51.047]  We're gonna do a hundred more episodes.
[02:27:51.567 --> 02:27:52.928]  He was, everyone was stoked on it.
[02:27:54.549 --> 02:28:05.716]  And you had basically just a couple blue check marks with, what, five, ten followers and retweets, simply send out a few emails and everyone just collapsed and capitulated.
[02:28:06.597 --> 02:28:09.719]  Yeah, it was, it was, I think probably what did it was
[02:28:11.207 --> 02:28:15.848]  Uh, Bernstein directly getting in contact with, uh, what's the guy, Jeff Zucker?
[02:28:15.888 --> 02:28:18.249]  The guy that runs, uh, whatever.
[02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.969]  What's Turner?
[02:28:20.409 --> 02:28:21.629]  What's above Turner?
[02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:24.170]  Yeah, I don't care about the BuzzFeed dude.
[02:28:25.210 --> 02:28:31.112]  Yeah, it was the BuzzFeed dude directly emailing the top, uh, Yamaka at the, uh, network.
[02:28:32.152 --> 02:28:34.212]  Getting us yanked.
[02:28:34.252 --> 02:28:34.812]  No offense.
[02:28:36.313 --> 02:28:36.653]  Did you...
[02:28:38.767 --> 02:28:42.828]  There was a phone call where you had a conversation with that guy.
[02:28:42.848 --> 02:28:44.409]  That was pretty funny.
[02:28:45.029 --> 02:28:47.630]  And you never did characterize yourself as alright.
[02:28:47.650 --> 02:28:51.111]  It was just sort of this label that then they paste on whoever they want.
[02:28:51.271 --> 02:28:52.711]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:52.811 --> 02:28:55.612]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com.
[02:28:55.652 --> 02:29:02.414]  I have this beautiful fashion bag that I often shop with and wear as I walk across campuses.
[02:29:03.192 --> 02:29:05.314]  And it's this beautiful face.
[02:29:05.414 --> 02:29:07.877]  I believe, is this Mrs. Mama Hyde?
[02:29:07.997 --> 02:29:08.718]  Is that Mama Hyde?
[02:29:08.738 --> 02:29:09.438]  Or who is that?
[02:29:09.458 --> 02:29:10.139]  Is that you?
[02:29:10.579 --> 02:29:17.226]  Well, that's me at a moment of high bloat and probably high estrogen as well.
[02:29:17.266 --> 02:29:19.548]  So if you want to call that Mama Hyde, you're welcome to.
[02:29:19.928 --> 02:29:22.551]  And I do resemble my mom in that.
[02:29:22.591 --> 02:29:23.192]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:29:24.413 --> 02:29:25.834]  You were asking about the alt-right thing.
[02:29:27.327 --> 02:29:31.671]  Alt-right is one of these terms that's so, it's such a linguistic weapon.
[02:29:31.711 --> 02:29:38.396]  It's like the word Nazi, where it kind of takes on the meaning of whatever the person throwing it out means.
[02:29:38.776 --> 02:29:41.979]  I don't think it's unfair to say that I'm alt-right.
[02:29:42.479 --> 02:29:53.288]  I definitely think that white people should have some sense of identity and should stop being such pussies and that we should stop pretending like race isn't real.
[02:29:53.568 --> 02:29:54.769]  I don't have any sort of hatred.
[02:29:58.459 --> 02:30:05.166]  So I think the one thing that was, the place they took it with was they said, that picture is crazy.
[02:30:05.767 --> 02:30:11.793]  The place they went with it was they said that we had swastikas in the graphics for the show.
[02:30:12.294 --> 02:30:15.157]  The graphics for the show, I worked on those.
[02:30:15.257 --> 02:30:18.681]  I put blood, sweat, and tears into those graphics.
[02:30:18.721 --> 02:30:20.563]  They were some of the best work
[02:30:21.024 --> 02:30:21.644]  I've ever done.
[02:30:22.605 --> 02:30:28.788]  And we were forced to censor them completely, including the logo for the show.
[02:30:29.849 --> 02:30:34.491]  So you can only really see the final versions by looking at my upload of them on YouTube.
[02:30:34.891 --> 02:30:39.213]  And there are no swastikas in any of the graphics for the show.
[02:30:40.894 --> 02:30:42.035]  So that's the one kind of funny
[02:30:42.901 --> 02:30:44.402]  Funny claim they made.
[02:30:44.422 --> 02:30:45.762]  It's bizarre.
[02:30:46.142 --> 02:30:56.327]  I deconstruct films and symbolism and I will point out, you know, squares and compasses and, you know, kind of esoteric masonic symbols in film and then these people will say, you're crazy, you're a lunatic, it doesn't exist.
[02:30:56.367 --> 02:30:59.328]  However, for you, oh, yeah.
[02:30:59.909 --> 02:31:01.449]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:31:02.070 --> 02:31:07.292]  Like symbolism suddenly becomes very real when it's directed at them.
[02:31:08.257 --> 02:31:15.084]  But the one thing we did was we used the James Holmes shooter logo in the main World Peace logo.
[02:31:15.104 --> 02:31:15.684]  That is true.
[02:31:16.365 --> 02:31:18.227]  As you can see, what is the meaning of life?
[02:31:18.327 --> 02:31:19.408]  What is the meaning of death?
[02:31:20.552 --> 02:31:25.116]  And the reason for that is, uh, this is like high level, serious satire.
[02:31:25.196 --> 02:31:27.638]  And of course, you know, Sarah Silverman, she can get away with it.
[02:31:27.678 --> 02:31:32.542]  She can make jokes about whatever she wants to, but you know, just subtle things, right?
[02:31:32.622 --> 02:31:42.130]  I mean, you have undergone a very bizarre situation where a meme of you, and I think you were probably like the first comedian to really become a meme.
[02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:44.212]  And then the meme takes on a life of its own.
[02:31:45.133 --> 02:31:46.334]  What was that experience like?
[02:31:47.719 --> 02:31:51.543]  It's not as shocking as people think.
[02:31:51.603 --> 02:31:55.206]  It really doesn't affect my life all that much, these shooter memes.
[02:31:55.246 --> 02:32:06.476]  I have gotten a few visits from the FBI, but there have always been... I explain to them how computers work, and I explain to them that it's possible to make a Facebook account with someone else's name.
[02:32:06.912 --> 02:32:13.677]  And then they usually stand down, not to mention the fact that I tower over them and physically dominate them and intimidate them in our interactions.
[02:32:14.177 --> 02:32:15.958]  We got this buff guy here, looks like Leon Trotsky.
[02:32:16.099 --> 02:32:21.963]  The first time they sent this guy that looked like Columbo, he actually struck me as a sharp guy, but he was a little guy.
[02:32:32.879 --> 02:32:41.186]  The second time they sent two big dudes that I was still bigger than, and I still was standing there flexing as I answered their questions.
[02:32:42.968 --> 02:32:45.070]  Can I give some shoutouts, Jay, before I forget here?
[02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:47.411]  Yeah.
[02:32:47.691 --> 02:32:49.293]  Shout out to Frank Hassel.
[02:32:49.333 --> 02:32:50.233]  Check him out on YouTube.
[02:32:50.273 --> 02:32:57.279]  Shout out to Big Flame, Joey, Instagram, JXXYY, JetNeptune, Concept Graphics.
[02:32:57.399 --> 02:32:57.839]  Killing it.
[02:32:57.999 --> 02:32:59.180]  ReignsFX.
[02:32:59.220 --> 02:32:59.801]  It's a short list.
[02:32:59.841 --> 02:33:00.421]  I'm almost through it.
[02:33:01.322 --> 02:33:08.447]  W Girardi on Instagram, Derek Maves, B9 Tumor, Jesse Yellen, Joe Rogan, and CantBot and Wecking Ball.
[02:33:08.747 --> 02:33:09.628]  CantBot and Wecking Ball.
[02:33:09.648 --> 02:33:10.008]  Check them out.
[02:33:10.149 --> 02:33:10.849]  Let's keep going here.
[02:33:10.869 --> 02:33:11.109]  What else?
[02:33:11.129 --> 02:33:11.970]  What else we got to talk about?
[02:33:13.123 --> 02:33:17.584]  Let's talk about the Great Reset because this whole, this idea of, have you heard of this hapitalism thing?
[02:33:17.644 --> 02:33:28.186]  This, this like gay version of capitalism, even more gayer, where it's like, now we're going to focus on an economics of making people happy.
[02:33:28.246 --> 02:33:34.107]  The UN is going to replace individual entrepreneurs and you're going to be- That sounds awesome.
[02:33:34.167 --> 02:33:36.088]  Yeah, doesn't that sound good?
[02:33:36.208 --> 02:33:42.189]  And this fits into this Great Reset where they're going to replace like owning stuff with
[02:33:43.092 --> 02:33:45.492]  With a circular sharing economy.
[02:33:45.533 --> 02:33:47.053]  That's what they want to bring.
[02:33:47.113 --> 02:33:50.874]  Has anyone, Jay, has anyone coined the term circle jerk economy yet?
[02:33:52.134 --> 02:33:52.974]  Can we start using that?
[02:33:53.074 --> 02:33:54.954]  That's where it goes apparently.
[02:33:55.314 --> 02:33:55.594]  Okay.
[02:33:56.735 --> 02:33:58.595]  No, I, that sounds, uh, that sounds fun.
[02:33:58.615 --> 02:34:02.956]  So you rent your stuff and you kind of like share the land and stuff like that's how it works.
[02:34:03.596 --> 02:34:03.856]  Okay.
[02:34:04.056 --> 02:34:04.196]  Yeah.
[02:34:04.216 --> 02:34:05.136]  You want to have a car?
[02:34:05.156 --> 02:34:06.077]  I didn't mean it anyway.
[02:34:06.097 --> 02:34:06.897]  I didn't want it anyway.
[02:34:06.997 --> 02:34:08.057]  I want, I want to, um,
[02:34:08.792 --> 02:34:21.488]  As long as the car that I'm renting can somehow benefit the impoverished people that throw glass outside my building and make it so that I have to get new tires and new windows every couple of months, as long as it can benefit them somehow, I'm happy for that.
[02:34:21.528 --> 02:34:21.868]  I love it.
[02:34:21.888 --> 02:34:24.211]  What else do you got?
[02:34:24.251 --> 02:34:24.732]  Great reset.
[02:34:25.899 --> 02:34:30.063]  Yeah, I bring this up because we know you're a fan of Stefan.
[02:34:30.083 --> 02:34:31.904]  Of course, Stefan just got de-platformed.
[02:34:32.645 --> 02:34:41.152]  And one thing that you talk about in some of your videos that's actually pretty practical I wanted to get to because you do have some good videos that are advice to young guys.
[02:34:41.793 --> 02:34:44.435]  And if you want to mention some of that because those are pretty popular as well.
[02:34:45.456 --> 02:34:47.118]  What's advice you give to young dudes?
[02:34:48.319 --> 02:34:51.762]  Well, step one is get you some of these.
[02:34:52.941 --> 02:34:55.022]  Some of these right here, estrogen blockers.
[02:34:55.362 --> 02:34:56.723]  Okay, you might need some of those.
[02:34:57.103 --> 02:35:10.369]  Dude, I was so, I was so lost because I had a, uh, my father wasn't like negligent or anything, but he just wasn't like, he wasn't a man in the sense of like, um, of, you know, the sense that we would, we would use it.
[02:35:10.429 --> 02:35:15.972]  And there's such a, there's such a lack of masculinity nowadays and an absence of male role models.
[02:35:16.192 --> 02:35:18.773]  And, um, it's, uh, it's,
[02:35:19.415 --> 02:35:21.396]  A crazy, crazy looking landscape.
[02:35:21.457 --> 02:35:31.263]  And that's why I think people like Stefan, Stefan gets a lot of people beefing with him for being culty and dogmatic and whatnot.
[02:35:31.383 --> 02:35:39.389]  And there's people that want to pick bones with Jordan Peterson over being kind of basic, can I say the B word, basic bitch?
[02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:40.810]  Is that allowed?
[02:35:41.479 --> 02:35:50.071]  People think, you know, Jordan Peterson's kind of a basic bitch guy and he's also, you know, whatever weakness with the painkillers and whatnot, but I think it's so important for
[02:35:51.226 --> 02:36:01.070]  To find male role models and try to emulate them or figure out, you know, get the old wisdom, the wisdom of old, and bring that into your own life.
[02:36:01.090 --> 02:36:02.731]  Because it still applies.
[02:36:03.291 --> 02:36:04.472]  We're still in a battle.
[02:36:04.692 --> 02:36:05.852]  It's an info war.
[02:36:05.892 --> 02:36:07.153]  It's a battle for the mind.
[02:36:07.233 --> 02:36:10.514]  It's not a bloody trench warfare battle.
[02:36:10.554 --> 02:36:14.376]  But we're in a battle for the soul of humanity right now.
[02:36:14.416 --> 02:36:18.457]  So you better start acting like it and get some of that old Sun Tzu wisdom.
[02:36:20.936 --> 02:36:31.021]  Yeah, I remember when I was mired in student debt back in my 20s and I was listening to Alex, I listened to Stefan at the time, and they were always talking about being an entrepreneur.
[02:36:31.041 --> 02:36:34.322]  And I kind of had in my mind that you can't start your own business.
[02:36:34.342 --> 02:36:37.784]  That's for some other weird CEO dude in Silicon Valley or something.
[02:36:37.824 --> 02:36:41.005]  And then finally, I just sort of broke and was like, I'm just going to try it.
[02:36:41.045 --> 02:36:41.526]  I might as well.
[02:36:42.899 --> 02:36:52.792]  Try that then be a wage slave and I ended up having some success and so I think there's a lot of wisdom in trying to get young guys to think about being an entrepreneur and you promote that a lot.
[02:36:52.812 --> 02:36:55.255]  I really appreciate that about what you talk about.
[02:36:56.537 --> 02:37:00.022]  It's getting harder with the tech stuff but you've been successful still.
[02:37:00.894 --> 02:37:02.915]  I got something important here, Jay.
[02:37:03.495 --> 02:37:07.738]  The only real resource... Young men nowadays are so destroyed.
[02:37:08.478 --> 02:37:09.939]  Their hormones are effed up.
[02:37:10.019 --> 02:37:12.320]  They have no money.
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:17.823]  Anybody I talk to that hits me up on Instagram or whatever, I'm like, first thing I ask is, how much money do you have saved up?
[02:37:18.603 --> 02:37:20.204]  They have $200.
[02:37:20.724 --> 02:37:21.425]  Nobody has nothing.
[02:37:21.465 --> 02:37:22.865]  Nobody has any skills, etc.
[02:37:23.186 --> 02:37:25.487]  The only thing young people have now is time.
[02:37:26.047 --> 02:37:26.647]  Time is this...
[02:37:29.653 --> 02:37:37.643]  It's cliche to say what a golden, important, vital resource, precious resource it is, but it's also true.
[02:37:37.703 --> 02:37:39.546]  You can't overstate the importance of time.
[02:37:42.335 --> 02:38:03.065]  Going into business, being an entrepreneur or whatever, getting some sort of skill, taking your time and trading it to somebody else for a barely over minimum wage, and if it's not getting you skills, if it's not advancing what you want to do for yourself and the world, it's such a colossal waste.
[02:38:03.245 --> 02:38:07.307]  When you think about that, if you're working at Target, if you work at Petco, if you work
[02:38:08.227 --> 02:38:08.727]  Thank you.
[02:38:27.927 --> 02:38:34.869]  I hear that beautiful piano music and I feel like I'm Matthew McConaughey flying my Lincoln up into space, because I think that's that.
[02:38:35.329 --> 02:38:36.029]  I think that's that.
[02:38:36.369 --> 02:38:40.491]  I think that's that beautiful music from that weird, creepy movie Interstellar that's off.
[02:38:40.511 --> 02:38:42.571]  So she's a bunch of it's a bunch of mess.
[02:38:42.631 --> 02:38:43.211]  Excuse me.
[02:38:43.892 --> 02:38:44.152]  I'm sorry.
[02:38:44.172 --> 02:38:47.072]  I went into I went into Matthew mode and I messed up there.
[02:38:47.192 --> 02:38:47.673]  Sam Hyde.
[02:38:47.953 --> 02:38:50.253]  He's with me here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:50.313 --> 02:38:51.714]  Welcome back, Sam.
[02:38:51.934 --> 02:38:55.735]  We were talking about men, what it is to be a man.
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:38:58.541]  You say things like, simple stuff.
[02:38:59.121 --> 02:38:59.721]  Lift weights.
[02:39:00.101 --> 02:39:00.782]  Get a skill.
[02:39:00.842 --> 02:39:01.542]  Get a trade.
[02:39:02.742 --> 02:39:03.422]  Get a gun.
[02:39:03.703 --> 02:39:04.483]  Go crazy.
[02:39:04.643 --> 02:39:05.523]  Become insane.
[02:39:05.703 --> 02:39:06.564]  Become desperate.
[02:39:06.824 --> 02:39:07.744]  Go out in the streets.
[02:39:08.384 --> 02:39:08.924]  I can't say that.
[02:39:08.964 --> 02:39:10.585]  Don't live in front of people, Jay.
[02:39:10.705 --> 02:39:10.965]  Right?
[02:39:11.345 --> 02:39:12.105]  Are you crazy?
[02:39:12.165 --> 02:39:13.066]  I can't say that.
[02:39:13.086 --> 02:39:24.630]  No, I think when you first start getting woke, when you first start learning that the world is this sick hall of mirrors, it's tempting to get
[02:39:26.788 --> 02:39:41.520]  Feverishly caught up in the various little plots and schemes and attempts to unravel them, which is important work, but I think a lot of people get overwhelmed by that and they get sort of fatalistic and blackpilled, as they say.
[02:39:42.401 --> 02:39:49.327]  And I think for anyone who ever gets blackpilled or overwhelmed or whatever, yeah, Pepe Silva, right?
[02:39:49.387 --> 02:39:51.028]  Sylvia right there.
[02:39:51.408 --> 02:39:55.852]  I think it's one of the most radical things you can do is take ownership over your own
[02:39:56.989 --> 02:40:06.596]  Little circle, your own, you know, yourself, your family, your friends, becoming, treating that like it's this world problem that you want to solve.
[02:40:07.196 --> 02:40:24.728]  And step one to that is learning about masculinity and getting, that's why people like Stefan Molyneux and Jordan Peterson are so attacked, even though none of what they say is really, you know, insane or racist or what have you.
[02:40:24.808 --> 02:40:25.149]  It's just,
[02:40:26.355 --> 02:40:32.842]  What they're saying is radical because it's effective, potentially, in fixing the world.
[02:40:32.882 --> 02:40:37.706]  I think people need to just get that masculinity, homie.
[02:40:40.028 --> 02:40:43.151]  Do you feel like comedy is dead now?
[02:40:45.593 --> 02:40:51.837]  I remember 10 years ago, I would watch Mitch Hedberg and comedians.
[02:40:51.857 --> 02:40:53.998]  I thought, oh yeah, stand-up, it's kind of funny.
[02:40:54.038 --> 02:41:00.723]  And then it's like, in the last 10 years, stand-up is almost itself another vehicle for social justice.
[02:41:00.763 --> 02:41:10.609]  And you got these, Hannah, what's her name, trans comedian, and she's just propped up because of like some weird, you know, fixation that she has.
[02:41:14.617 --> 02:41:16.558]  Even big ones, even great ones.
[02:41:17.118 --> 02:41:18.759]  Is that a man right there that we're looking at?
[02:41:19.519 --> 02:41:20.720]  I thought that was a lesbian.
[02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:25.682]  Well, if you became Samantha Hyde, then you would probably be welcomed back, right?
[02:41:25.742 --> 02:41:28.804]  Dude, that person is so disturbing to look at.
[02:41:28.844 --> 02:41:29.444]  I probably would.
[02:41:29.804 --> 02:41:31.025]  That's a good tactic right there.
[02:41:31.085 --> 02:41:39.109]  I tried being whack, but I didn't take enough melatonin or melatonin to convince people.
[02:41:40.216 --> 02:41:41.177]  Comedy's dead.
[02:41:41.377 --> 02:41:48.043]  For comedy to be an art form that's worthwhile, it has to be subversive.
[02:41:48.063 --> 02:41:49.864]  It has to be the underdog.
[02:41:49.904 --> 02:41:54.108]  It has to be the voice of truth.
[02:41:55.129 --> 02:41:57.731]  Of truth that's uncomfortable to speak.
[02:41:57.871 --> 02:42:03.876]  And now the version of truth that's uncomfortable to speak is F. Trump.
[02:42:04.687 --> 02:42:05.187]  You know what I mean?
[02:42:05.767 --> 02:42:06.728]  In one way or another.
[02:42:06.828 --> 02:42:12.870]  It's whether it's availed in a sophisticated way or whether it's just straight up, uh, look at Donald Trump.
[02:42:12.910 --> 02:42:13.550]  He's so fat.
[02:42:13.610 --> 02:42:15.211]  He's got no penis.
[02:42:15.691 --> 02:42:16.871]  He must have a short penis.
[02:42:17.291 --> 02:42:23.914]  Or whether it's something more sophisticated like, like, uh, some of the stuff that Dave Chappelle has done recently.
[02:42:24.194 --> 02:42:27.335]  Uh, it's, it's all F Trump in some way or another.
[02:42:28.015 --> 02:42:30.096]  So no, it's, it's, it's a wasteland.
[02:42:31.161 --> 02:42:34.545]  Yeah, and there's a similar parallel in journalism.
[02:42:34.585 --> 02:42:42.934]  Journalism used to be supposedly this thing that was there to keep eyes on the establishment and to critique and chase after stories.
[02:42:43.134 --> 02:42:52.764]  Supposedly, we have this idea of journalists going after mobsters back in the 50s, and they would pursue the truth to their own altruistic ends, wherever they went.
[02:42:53.484 --> 02:42:55.986]  Yeah, and now it is the establishment.
[02:42:56.046 --> 02:43:02.372]  Now journalism, now the political establishment bends the knee to the media a lot of the time.
[02:43:02.432 --> 02:43:03.973]  And now it's just a hand-in-hand.
[02:43:04.334 --> 02:43:10.459]  It's part of the same coctopus, same octopus right there, you know?
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:14.362]  Do you think there's stages of the cucking of comedy?
[02:43:14.402 --> 02:43:19.847]  Like, does a big comedian kind of get to a certain point and then he's maybe expected to do this, this, this?
[02:43:21.121 --> 02:43:23.803]  To go to the next level or to keep getting the work?
[02:43:24.603 --> 02:43:25.484]  Is that where it's at?
[02:43:25.504 --> 02:43:29.146]  Where they're all basically expected to do this?
[02:43:29.246 --> 02:43:43.355]  They made it pretty clear to me that we would have... One reason why our group kind of fractured afterwards was they made it clear to me that we would have been able to keep the show if I issued a public apology and took our subreddit down.
[02:43:44.816 --> 02:43:46.678]  There's definitely... Yeah, of course.
[02:43:46.738 --> 02:43:47.338]  Anytime you get
[02:43:48.050 --> 02:43:51.152]  I'm sure it's the same in any field, any industry.
[02:43:51.212 --> 02:43:57.835]  As you get bigger, a shadowy figure comes out of the woodwork and tells you, hey, you have to say this.
[02:43:58.515 --> 02:44:00.096]  Just alter your message slightly.
[02:44:01.736 --> 02:44:10.621]  If your podcast gets bought by some company that has a lot of Chinese money, there's probably a topic that you're going to start avoiding because of it.
[02:44:12.181 --> 02:44:13.862]  What's your favorite MDE sketch?
[02:44:13.882 --> 02:44:15.483]  Joe Rogan.
[02:44:15.843 --> 02:44:16.924]  Sorry, I'm just kidding.
[02:44:18.732 --> 02:44:20.994]  We'll get to your challenge here in a minute.
[02:44:21.594 --> 02:44:23.155]  Joe, I want him.
[02:44:23.416 --> 02:44:24.156]  I can taste blood.
[02:44:25.958 --> 02:44:34.904]  Probably my favorite stuff is the stuff I did on my cell phone in my mom's apartment way back in the day, because that was the most insane.
[02:44:34.944 --> 02:44:37.026]  You tormenting your mom is just golden.
[02:44:38.027 --> 02:44:38.287]  Yeah.
[02:44:38.307 --> 02:44:39.048]  It's awesome.
[02:44:39.248 --> 02:44:42.710]  It was the most insane and desperate, desperate time of my life.
[02:44:43.011 --> 02:44:45.893]  And those videos, it was like the one
[02:44:48.121 --> 02:44:57.070]  Not Ray of Hope, but it was like the one, the most joyous moments were in front of that mirror, just saying the most cracked, cracked out stuff that I could come up with.
[02:44:57.090 --> 02:45:01.233]  All of your moms, your moms echoing constantly.
[02:45:01.514 --> 02:45:02.094]  Sam!
[02:45:02.134 --> 02:45:02.234]  Sam!
[02:45:02.274 --> 02:45:02.375]  Sam!
[02:45:02.755 --> 02:45:03.736]  Oh my goodness.
[02:45:03.796 --> 02:45:08.120]  You just keep pushing it, pushing it, pushing it.
[02:45:08.715 --> 02:45:09.035]  I know.
[02:45:10.137 --> 02:45:13.440]  Part of her, it's not so much that I want to abuse my mom or anything.
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:14.661]  I love my mom so much.
[02:45:14.721 --> 02:45:15.862]  I talk to her often.
[02:45:16.283 --> 02:45:20.207]  But her style of parenting was just such a
[02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:46.902]  Constant like brow beating and um nannying and like telling telling me that my teeth were gonna fall out if I uh you know used them to like unscrew a bottle cap or something or that I was gonna burn the roof of my mouth like hypochondriac hypochondriac stuff like to an extreme like constant warnings you're gonna you're never gonna you're gonna lose your fingertips if you touch the the that thing you're gonna get electrocuted if you go down your stairs
[02:45:47.282 --> 02:45:49.104]  You have to watch out on the streets.
[02:45:49.564 --> 02:45:58.512]  So the kind of like light abuse that I gave her in those videos, trust me, is fully warranted.
[02:45:58.532 --> 02:46:02.115]  You and your mom, I'm guessing, she's Boomer, right?
[02:46:02.155 --> 02:46:04.857]  There's something about the Boomer era where they're afraid of everything.
[02:46:05.057 --> 02:46:07.179]  You know, like they're really afraid of everything.
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:08.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:09.161]  Big time.
[02:46:09.901 --> 02:46:10.842]  She's def Boomer.
[02:46:10.902 --> 02:46:11.823]  Boomer to the core.
[02:46:11.923 --> 02:46:12.664]  Boomer to the core.
[02:46:14.537 --> 02:46:17.480]  Now, you have a campaign going.
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:18.401]  Let's talk about that.
[02:46:18.521 --> 02:46:22.486]  You have issued, you want to get Rogan into the octagon.
[02:46:23.487 --> 02:46:24.808]  I've issued several threats.
[02:46:25.129 --> 02:46:31.396]  I've had some of my friends from the martial arts world, Chuck Norris, Nick Diaz, Lennox Lewis,
[02:46:32.219 --> 02:46:32.439]  I don't
[02:46:47.932 --> 02:46:48.072]  Let's
[02:47:06.523 --> 02:47:07.383]  Then Joe Rogan.
[02:47:07.403 --> 02:47:09.884]  Do you think Lennox Lewis would make a video for Joe Rogan?
[02:47:09.924 --> 02:47:10.725]  I don't think so, okay?
[02:47:10.905 --> 02:47:14.126]  The guy's a multi-multi-millionaire, best legendary heavyweight.
[02:47:14.146 --> 02:47:15.547]  I don't think he's making a video for Joe Rogan.
[02:47:15.567 --> 02:47:17.348]  He made one for me because I'm in the game.
[02:47:17.368 --> 02:47:17.948]  I'm in the game.
[02:47:19.468 --> 02:47:20.049]  Joe, come on.
[02:47:20.089 --> 02:47:22.189]  And you're ready to step into that octagon.
[02:47:23.170 --> 02:47:25.111]  I'll step into the octagon with Joe.
[02:47:25.511 --> 02:47:25.971]  I don't care.
[02:47:27.071 --> 02:47:31.633]  I'll let him put his pajamas on and try to cuddle me and roll around.
[02:47:31.833 --> 02:47:33.014]  I'll punch him dead in his face.
[02:47:33.649 --> 02:47:34.129]  I don't care.
[02:47:34.149 --> 02:47:41.936]  I know what his strategy would be to hug me and try to cuddle with me in pajamas for 10 minutes.
[02:47:41.956 --> 02:47:42.917]  Try to wear me out like that?
[02:47:42.937 --> 02:47:44.778]  No, you're getting punched dead in the face, Joe.
[02:47:45.019 --> 02:47:46.500]  I don't care if you've got a turning sidekick.
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:47.781]  I've got a flipping sidekick.
[02:47:47.801 --> 02:47:50.303]  I've got a backwards around town sidekick.
[02:47:50.323 --> 02:47:51.624]  You haven't even seen my sidekick.
[02:47:52.905 --> 02:47:54.707]  He'll come in with a team of lawyers.
[02:47:55.768 --> 02:47:56.808]  Probably, yeah.
[02:47:56.828 --> 02:47:57.929]  11 lawyers in the octagon.
[02:47:58.950 --> 02:48:00.952]  I'll come in with a team of Hispanic gangbangers.
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:02.480]  How about that, Joe?
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:04.000]  Oh, some Cholos!
[02:48:04.641 --> 02:48:05.421]  I got Cholos.
[02:48:06.041 --> 02:48:13.163]  My MS-13 homies, Cezan, Chino, Compache, Chico, Chachi, Cheech, they'll all be there.
[02:48:14.403 --> 02:48:23.005]  And by the way, I issued a challenge to you, which you ignored, which was that after that, I will step into the octagon with you, and you can bring Butterbean or any of the washed-up UFC people.
[02:48:29.452 --> 02:48:31.013]  You're a man of God.
[02:48:31.073 --> 02:48:37.315]  I don't want to test my standing with the big man upstairs by taking on one of his great champions.
[02:48:37.515 --> 02:48:38.755]  I'll pass on that one, alright?
[02:48:39.675 --> 02:48:41.636]  Alright, well thank you Sam for joining me.
[02:48:42.436 --> 02:48:43.037]  It was great.
[02:48:43.317 --> 02:48:45.137]  Hey Jay, thanks a lot man for having me on.
[02:48:45.758 --> 02:48:47.918]  Absolutely.
[02:48:47.938 --> 02:48:51.740]  Esoteric Hollywood, thank you for sending that out as well, my man.
[02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:53.080]  Yes, hope you enjoy it.
[02:49:04.002 --> 02:49:07.785]  Just a few months ago, almost every storable food manufacturer was sold out.
[02:49:08.325 --> 02:49:11.667]  They were still taking people's orders, and many of the companies have still not fulfilled them.
[02:49:12.108 --> 02:49:13.849]  All the orders we got in have been fulfilled.
[02:49:14.189 --> 02:49:20.374]  Our supplier is the best, the highest quality, the best containers to transport it as well, and they've got the food with four factories in stock.
[02:49:20.394 --> 02:49:22.956]  It takes them two to four weeks to get it shipped out to you.
[02:49:23.356 --> 02:49:25.097]  You need to order your storable food now.
[02:49:25.437 --> 02:49:26.878]  The world is much more dire.
[02:49:27.058 --> 02:49:28.800]  The economic system is collapsing.
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:30.301]  The third world's already starving to death.
[02:49:30.581 --> 02:49:31.882]  Food prices are exploding here.
[02:49:32.723 --> 02:49:36.545]  The farms and the production plants are shutting down because of the COVID hoax.
[02:49:36.865 --> 02:49:40.207]  You need to get your storable food while you still can at MFORSTORE.COM.
[02:49:40.227 --> 02:49:40.988]  It's a 360 win.
[02:49:41.248 --> 02:49:42.508]  It also funds our operation.
[02:49:42.789 --> 02:49:45.150]  But you need to get it, whether it's three months, six months, a year.
[02:49:45.450 --> 02:49:49.932]  You need to get that now and have that checkbox off of being prepared and being self-sufficient.
[02:49:49.952 --> 02:49:53.674]  We also have high-quality water filtration and air filtration at MFORSTORE.COM.
[02:49:53.695 --> 02:49:54.515]  They're an absolute must.
[02:49:54.535 --> 02:49:58.497]  But whatever you do, ladies and gentlemen, don't wait until a bigger crisis comes.
[02:49:58.917 --> 02:50:00.578]  Don't wait until everybody panics.
[02:50:00.818 --> 02:50:01.239]  Take action.
[02:50:01.259 --> 02:50:01.739]  Get ready now.
[02:50:03.737 --> 02:50:14.381]  Owen Schroyer here, host of the InfoWars War Room, every day from 3 to 6 p.m., and that means I have to follow up after the big man, and that is not an easy task.
[02:50:14.482 --> 02:50:19.604]  So I need to be as focused and energized as possible every day at 3 o'clock.
[02:50:19.744 --> 02:50:20.164]  So yes,
[02:50:20.464 --> 02:50:23.125]  I am on performance-enhancing drugs.
[02:50:23.605 --> 02:50:46.111]  It's the combination of the energy of the turbo force, the focus of the brain force, and then the VasoBeat Complete, which is a beet supplement, which act as a vasodilator, which makes sure that the nutrients and supplements that you're intaking are getting all throughout the body so that I can maintain proper focus and energy for three hours and beyond.
[02:50:46.311 --> 02:50:47.592]  It's almost three o'clock.
[02:50:47.792 --> 02:50:54.258]  That means it's time to take my performance enhancers that I have conveniently stashed right here at my desk.
[02:50:54.378 --> 02:50:58.201]  I literally will never host a war room without them.
[02:50:58.381 --> 02:51:01.944]  It starts with the Turbo Force right here.
[02:51:02.144 --> 02:51:05.527]  Just get your cup of water, pour in the Turbo Force.
[02:51:05.747 --> 02:51:08.370]  I then take my Vezo Beat Complete right here.
[02:51:09.210 --> 02:51:09.831]  One dropper.
[02:51:10.792 --> 02:51:11.452]  Two droppers.
[02:51:12.173 --> 02:51:14.275]  Stir it up just a little bit for good measure.
[02:51:15.908 --> 02:51:33.807]  And then, with the energy from the TurboForce and the nitrates in the VesoBeat Complete, with the Focus from BrainForce, with the Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and all the other supplements that are inside of that, those are the supplements I take.
[02:51:34.853 --> 02:51:41.295]  Every day, right before I go on air, for maximum performance, maximum focus, maximum energy.
[02:51:41.735 --> 02:51:54.559]  And the good news is, once I finish drinking this Turbo Force, I've got energy for about 10 hours, so I can continue working, pass the show, work on other things, go and lift weights, run, whatever I need or want to do.
[02:51:54.759 --> 02:52:03.122]  It's all with the Turbo Force, the Brain Force, and the Vezo Beat Complete Trifecta, available only at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:52:03.933 --> 02:52:08.254]  I've talked to the EMS, I've talked to medical doctors, and what makes you nauseated is not just the smell of piss.
[02:52:08.274 --> 02:52:10.295]  What we call the smell of lung piss.
[02:52:10.315 --> 02:52:11.856]  It has this sweet, nauseating smell.
[02:52:11.896 --> 02:52:17.297]  It's a sweet stench that makes you want to throw up like rotten meat.
[02:52:17.377 --> 02:52:19.118]  It is the crap of dust mites.
[02:52:19.571 --> 02:52:23.713]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist-run neighborhoods?
[02:52:24.093 --> 02:52:30.617]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing, and InfoWars Store has the solution.
[02:52:30.837 --> 02:52:43.284]  InfoWars has created the most powerful herbal lung cleanse and respiratory support product on the market, with over a thousand types of mold and mildew, toxic chemicals, and yes, dust mites.
[02:52:43.724 --> 02:52:57.089]  Our Lung Cleanse Plus, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs, is just what you need to survive the unprecedented surge of bum piss and other toxic substances in liberal leftist cities everywhere.
[02:52:57.369 --> 02:53:03.131]  Order the InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse Plus supplement today at infowarstore.com.
[02:53:03.831 --> 02:53:08.353]  Four years ago, I added a member to the InfoWars Life team who has developed
[02:53:11.254 --> 02:53:11.614]  We're good to go.
[02:53:38.618 --> 02:53:40.220]  Now, folks absolutely love it.
[02:53:40.260 --> 02:53:42.021]  They love the results that they get from it.
[02:53:42.822 --> 02:53:45.385]  Now, this is apples and oranges because it complements bodies.
[02:53:45.925 --> 02:53:52.092]  But, going back over seven years ago, we had a major supplier of high-quality, organic turmeric that was liquid that you take under the tongue.
[02:53:52.512 --> 02:53:53.253]  And people loved it.
[02:53:53.573 --> 02:53:58.758]  Then we could no longer get any more because that company was so overloaded with orders from other people.
[02:53:58.878 --> 02:54:01.421]  Because getting high-quality turmeric is really a tough thing to do.
[02:54:01.841 --> 02:54:07.791]  We've now secured another company in the last year that has even higher quality turmeric concentrate.
[02:54:07.831 --> 02:54:11.296]  This is one ingredient, pure turmeric extract.
[02:54:11.537 --> 02:54:13.520]  It's the liquid type, taken under the tongue.
[02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:16.865]  If you love bodies, I think you're really going to love this product.
[02:54:17.225 --> 02:54:21.989]  Some people around the office that have tried it say it's better than bodies, some say it's not, some say it supercharges it.
[02:54:22.409 --> 02:54:31.937]  All I know is this is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, turmeric extracts under the tongue you can find out there and it's got a different delivery system.
[02:54:32.257 --> 02:54:37.281]  All I know is this is one of the strongest turmeric concentrates that's liquid that you take under the tongue
[02:54:37.541 --> 02:54:38.021]  We're good to go.
