[00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.050]  InfoWars.
[00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.031]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:23.132]  The year is 2020.
[00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:43.359]  Following several decades of systematically weakening the social, moral, and financial resilience of the American people, the global cabal has launched a series of unimaginable terrors that have rocked the foundation of Western civilization and has fractured the population of a once united country along increasingly irreconcilable lines.
[00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:54.530]  The nation finds herself on the precipice of all-out civil war, diving headlong towards economic ruin, and already suffocating under the dictatorship of biotechnocratic enslavement.
[00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:59.455]  The final takedown order has been issued, the direct attack has begun.
[00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.714]  America's greatest trial, and the battle for her survival, is underway.
[00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:10.981]  InfoWars Emergency Transmissions are now broadcasting live weeknights 7 to 9 p.m.
[00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:18.009]  Central Standard Time, Election Countdown, Taking America Back on Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.313]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.674]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Saturday afternoon transmission, August 29th.
[00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:55.155]  The year is 2020.
[00:01:55.296 --> 00:02:06.024]  And I come to you with really, really incredibly important, very, very serious news that is earth shaking.
[00:02:07.906 --> 00:02:08.026]  And
[00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:11.377]  The globalists knew that this moment was coming and they've been building towards this.
[00:02:11.418 --> 00:02:12.919]  That's why they're now censoring the president.
[00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.581]  They're censoring the American people.
[00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:30.735]  They are absolutely shutting down any form of real communication because they won't be able to get away with this criminal takeover if we have our speech and if we're aware of what's happening and if we oppose it.
[00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:31.936]  It's very elementary.
[00:02:31.976 --> 00:02:35.499]  It's very, very simple what they've been up to and what they've gone along with.
[00:02:37.383 --> 00:02:45.365]  This is an international criminal takeover of not just our country, but the world right now, and a scientific dictatorship that is being established.
[00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:46.245]  Okay.
[00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:55.367]  Yesterday afternoon, I get off air, I'm handling business around the office, doing research, and I see an Associated Press article.
[00:02:56.628 --> 00:03:01.709]  Top General says no role for military in presidential vote.
[00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.170]  And I read it and I was completely stunned.
[00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:12.453]  And then I went and read other statements and other comments.
[00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:20.617]  And it, of course, is the culmination of everything that we have been here talking about.
[00:03:24.258 --> 00:03:31.802]  If you're going to have a plot against the president and against the American people, there's going to come a point
[00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:35.445]  Where you can't have it in secret anymore.
[00:03:36.126 --> 00:03:48.874]  You've got to bring it out in the public and launch it and try to sell the public on the fact that it is legitimate and that it is needed and that it is good.
[00:03:50.695 --> 00:04:02.282]  And you look at all the preparations of the last year or so since they triggered this operation, you see it building to a head with all the top Democrats.
[00:04:03.322 --> 00:04:27.502]  Whether it's Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Obama, Pelosi, Hillary, all of them, the former Attorney General, Eric Holder, and every major newspaper that is national, every major cable network, every major pundit,
[00:04:29.295 --> 00:04:37.040]  Creating this false reality that Trump's gonna lose, and when he loses, if he can test the election, the military's gonna have to remove him.
[00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:56.412]  So, trial balloons, testing the waters, and then going mainstream with it the last two months, building through a crescendo with Hillary telling Politico last week, Joe Biden is not going to concede no matter what.
[00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:59.709]  We're going to drag this out.
[00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.732]  Now we know from over a month ago, the War Game Podesta meetings at the DNC at the highest levels.
[00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:11.975]  With Hillary involved, Michelle Obama, Barack, Biden's their puppet, Kamala Harris is their puppet.
[00:05:13.436 --> 00:05:19.138]  And they openly say, we're going to have the states secede that are blue.
[00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:24.721]  And we're going to say that Trump is illegitimate when he wins the electoral college.
[00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:27.482]  We're going to go with the popular vote if he loses that again.
[00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:41.042]  And we're going to basically stage riots nationwide and hold the dollar and the economy and the stock market hostage and see what the military is going to do, is the quote.
[00:05:43.303 --> 00:05:46.784]  And the New York Times reported on this like it was no big deal.
[00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:50.146]  And then Breitbart and others picked it up.
[00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:54.748]  Headline, Democrats war game, states seceding in contested election.
[00:05:54.948 --> 00:05:55.869]  That's called a civil war.
[00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:08.047]  And so we've seen the Council on Foreign Relations, we've seen the globalists, we've seen their mouthpieces at the governmental level canvassing the Pentagon 14 months ago.
[00:06:09.948 --> 00:06:11.409]  Will you be part of a coup?
[00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:12.670]  Will you go along with it?
[00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.432]  And then telling military brass, if you don't, we're going to put you in prison.
[00:06:17.694 --> 00:06:24.717]  And that's why they've put most of the people that helped Trump get elected in jail or tried to, including yours truly.
[00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:27.459]  Manafort, Roger Stone, the list goes on and on.
[00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:29.620]  That is a message to everybody.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.400]  We control the Justice Department.
[00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:32.901]  You better do what we say.
[00:06:34.462 --> 00:06:40.245]  But a lot of people have stood in the gap despite the intimidation of threats and you've supported the broadcast.
[00:06:40.285 --> 00:06:47.288]  So we're still here, but I want you to understand before I get into this, why this is such a huge story and how it is not the cherry on top.
[00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:58.391]  But really the beginning of the end of the deep state and the biggest news in Trump land I have ever reported.
[00:06:59.172 --> 00:07:01.253]  It's bigger than Trump coming down the golden escalator.
[00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:04.795]  It's bigger than Trump winning the election.
[00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:10.679]  Because that was just to get into semi power and have a battle with the swamp.
[00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:19.524]  If he wins this, then he can really go after the entrenched establishment that is absolutely out to get this country and doesn't believe the country should even exist.
[00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:31.726]  And they've done so many criminal things and are so sold out to the shy comms and others that if they don't regain power, they are absolutely done and devastated.
[00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:36.688]  And this is the entire world government new world order system.
[00:07:37.128 --> 00:07:49.913]  Now I can tell you, I've had just in the last 12 hours, since we started covering this had the highest level media in the country call the highest.
[00:07:50.939 --> 00:08:04.028]  The two biggest names in media, other than Alex Jones, I'm not into who's big, but as for as big as you can get, the two of the biggest, saying, man, this is the cherry on top, that you've been absolutely correct.
[00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:09.572]  People are asking why you were obsessed with the military coup, why you were saying they're trying to get the military to overthrow the president.
[00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:13.315]  Before it was ever even in the news, you're just totally right again.
[00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:18.041]  It's because I've studied the power structure.
[00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:31.110]  I don't study mainstream politics that's pablum, that's baby food for the public, that's rabbit trails and distractions and lost empty calories like cotton candy.
[00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.471]  I'm steak and potatoes.
[00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:36.194]  And I know how politics really works around the world.
[00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:37.815]  I know who the power players are.
[00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:43.900]  And I know for a fact they don't put out CFR reports about COG needs to be triggered
[00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:46.557]  To remove Trump using the military?
[00:08:46.577 --> 00:08:49.601]  Well, that's not how COG works.
[00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:50.362]  That's treason!
[00:08:50.442 --> 00:08:52.385]  That's a real hot coup!
[00:08:53.641 --> 00:09:06.704]  Not a warm coup, not a cold coup, not the stuff we've seen trying to get delegates not to seek the president four years ago, or spying on the president and putting out fake stories and having fake impeachments.
[00:09:07.164 --> 00:09:09.665]  That's all process coups, and they're bad enough.
[00:09:10.405 --> 00:09:20.207]  They're trying to organize a white-hot, flamethrower, explosive, kill Julius Caesar coup.
[00:09:23.826 --> 00:09:26.429]  And not even thinking about the consequences of that.
[00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.030]  Well, actually they are.
[00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.911]  That's why they have COVID.
[00:09:28.991 --> 00:09:35.298]  It's martial law cover, and they're actually ready to try to arrest thousands of patriot leaders and people they know aren't traitors.
[00:09:36.239 --> 00:09:42.785]  I mean, we're right up to the edge of just a giant bloodbath civil war, and it's going to be absolutely horrible.
[00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:44.187]  Millions of dead.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:10:01.594]  I mean, I cannot hype to you enough how horrible it will be if we go over the edge of this cliff and we're right on the cliff hanging out and we're being held on by justice and freedom and the truth by one of our belt buckles.
[00:10:01.654 --> 00:10:05.057]  But we're leaning out over the side of the cliff right now.
[00:10:06.318 --> 00:10:11.642]  So let me start over now that I've given you a basic boil down and just get to the meat and potatoes here for you.
[00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:13.724]  But I've never
[00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:23.689]  Covering Trump and what's happened covered something this big because you're like, yes, Alex, you've told us thousands of times, thousands of times.
[00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:40.343]  I mean, we're talking every segment, every hour about the criminal elements of the deep state that work with the shy comms, Hollywood, the EU, openly trying with big tech to legitimize the removal of Trump outside the 25th amendment and even outside
[00:10:41.897 --> 00:10:42.137]  I think?
[00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:15.703]  By John Podesta, who ran Hillary's campaign and is still in control.
[00:11:18.525 --> 00:11:23.568]  So it's one thing to have them wargaming it and pushing it in the news and trying to get the idea legitimized.
[00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:30.273]  But then it's another thing when, and I didn't even know this happened a couple weeks ago.
[00:11:30.353 --> 00:11:32.675]  I just learned about it when this came out in the Associated Press.
[00:11:33.495 --> 00:11:41.901]  They sent a letter on the House Armed Services Committee with a CIA operative they ran a few years ago and put on
[00:11:44.997 --> 00:11:52.841]  The Dias there, to Milley, saying, are you with us?
[00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:55.682]  The coup conspirators, are you going to be with Trump?
[00:11:56.062 --> 00:12:11.670]  And that's why the same day they had a, he got the letter, they had a Washington Post headline that if cabinet members, and he's the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he's in, you know, on the, by the cabinet, if they don't help us with the coup, they will be put in prison.
[00:12:12.435 --> 00:12:16.080]  So they tell Milley, you'll be put in prison if you don't go along with this.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.562]  I'll show you the Washington Post headline.
[00:12:18.664 --> 00:12:22.248]  And then Milley comes back and says, that is not the role of the military in the Constitution.
[00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:23.951]  There's three branches of government.
[00:12:24.031 --> 00:12:27.516]  We are assigned to the executive, but we're funded by Congress.
[00:12:28.257 --> 00:12:29.098]  That's treason.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.401]  So let me just spell this out very, very simply, very, very simply.
[00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:44.584]  So when you talk to your friends, your neighbors, your family, they can understand because I, you know, I got called by two of the top talk show hosts of the country.
[00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:47.285]  And they're like, what does this mean?
[00:12:47.345 --> 00:12:48.245]  You told us it was coming.
[00:12:48.285 --> 00:12:50.186]  It's exactly, you said, what does this mean?
[00:12:50.566 --> 00:12:52.027]  And I'm like, well, what do you mean?
[00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:52.827]  What does this mean?
[00:12:53.507 --> 00:12:55.288]  They shopped around a cube.
[00:12:56.288 --> 00:13:02.831]  They then publicly promoted it to make it look like they were powerful and to look like they were strong and to look like.
[00:13:03.962 --> 00:13:08.624]  They had the support because you've got to look like you're confident.
[00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:17.487]  And it takes a lot of confidence to, you know, be in the front page of the Washington Post saying, if you don't aid us, the military overthrow of the president and the voters will put you in prison.
[00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:21.168]  And so that's what this is.
[00:13:22.809 --> 00:13:25.010]  So let me boil it down for everybody one more time.
[00:13:28.231 --> 00:13:31.532]  The Democrats publicly promoted a coup against the president.
[00:13:32.802 --> 00:13:49.737]  In the confusion of the 80 million mail-in ballots and everything they've done to gum it up, they know they're gonna lose, Hillary now admits it's the campaign strategy to confuse the election and to drag it out, to hurt the economy and hold the nation hostage, and that they hope the military will remove Trump.
[00:13:50.437 --> 00:14:00.166]  Then they tell Milley and others, we will arrest you if you don't aid us when this happens, so a Soviet-style threat, and Milley sends a letter out
[00:14:01.693 --> 00:14:08.337]  Saying that it's not our role, this is illegal, and I can't believe you even asked us if we would aid you in doing this.
[00:14:08.397 --> 00:14:09.958]  So, the U.S.
[00:14:09.998 --> 00:14:20.223]  military did the right thing and said though publicly, we are not going to aid you in removing the president during an election.
[00:14:20.544 --> 00:14:22.185]  That's handled by the Supreme Court.
[00:14:22.665 --> 00:14:25.566]  That's handled by the process, not by the military.
[00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:26.347]  No kidding.
[00:14:27.349 --> 00:14:28.570]  We are not Venezuela.
[00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:29.831]  We are not North Korea.
[00:14:30.091 --> 00:14:31.172]  We are not Communist China.
[00:14:31.712 --> 00:14:56.270]  So the Democrats, out of options, knowing they're losing in all of this trouble, pulling their hair out, start going on national TV three months ago, it was in the CFR a year ago, and saying, we're going to remove the Trump campaign through COG,
[00:14:57.682 --> 00:15:04.148]  Remember Pelosi went on TV just about five weeks ago and said, Oh, I had a meeting with the COG, Continental Government.
[00:15:04.188 --> 00:15:06.690]  That's the Pentagon because we're hit by nuclear weapons or an asteroid.
[00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.692]  And we're going to remove him one way or another.
[00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:09.473]  He'll be fumigated.
[00:15:09.493 --> 00:15:10.133]  He's on his way out.
[00:15:11.434 --> 00:15:13.957]  And I'd seen that in CFR documents 14 months ago.
[00:15:17.461 --> 00:15:19.584]  So then I was like, okay, they're going ahead with the plan.
[00:15:19.624 --> 00:15:20.425]  They're now promoting it.
[00:15:21.165 --> 00:15:25.691]  And then it built to this crescendo 66 days out from the election yesterday.
[00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:26.872]  65 today.
[00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:27.753]  We're live on Saturday.
[00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:28.794]  Just tuned in.
[00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:37.305]  And the Pentagon said, we are not going to be part of this.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.621]  This is not our role.
[00:15:39.681 --> 00:15:40.461]  It's not our job.
[00:15:40.762 --> 00:15:41.522]  This is outrageous.
[00:15:41.542 --> 00:15:54.333]  So if you're tuned in right now, your patriotic duty, your own self-preservation duty, your own common sense duty is that you take the live link we just put on screen and I'll read it out for radio listeners and audio listeners.
[00:15:55.474 --> 00:15:56.575]  Breaking news alert!
[00:15:56.655 --> 00:15:59.697]  Pentagon exposes dim coup plot against Trump.
[00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:05.022]  Meanwhile, blue states announced COVID-19 checkpoints and forced testing
[00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.126]  Watch now and spread the live link.
[00:16:08.246 --> 00:16:10.007]  Go to newswars.com.
[00:16:10.388 --> 00:16:12.349]  Go to infowars.com.
[00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.651]  Get the links.
[00:16:17.392 --> 00:16:17.873]  Email them.
[00:16:18.113 --> 00:16:18.913]  Text message them.
[00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:19.714]  Call people.
[00:16:19.914 --> 00:16:20.554]  Send them there.
[00:16:20.955 --> 00:16:21.755]  Put it on Facebook.
[00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:22.476]  Put it on Twitter.
[00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:34.444]  This is everything we've said now being manifest in front of you at the highest levels and the Pentagon, after being threatened with being put in jail,
[00:16:36.044 --> 00:16:41.147]  If they don't aid the coup saying, no, this is illegal.
[00:16:42.728 --> 00:16:43.728]  And now it's in the news.
[00:16:44.849 --> 00:16:55.274]  Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs is being criticized because they're saying he's Trump's man.
[00:16:55.575 --> 00:16:58.916]  He won't remove Trump when that's not the military's job.
[00:16:59.257 --> 00:17:05.220]  Unless we are you two Brutus with the fall of the Roman Republic, when they start stabbing Julius Caesar.
[00:17:09.878 --> 00:17:16.660]  The military follows executive action from the president or from the governors in their locale.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.741]  And Congress, if they don't like it, has a check on it of the purse.
[00:17:23.222 --> 00:17:26.023]  And the president shouldn't be using the military in an election.
[00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:29.804]  That's the courts.
[00:17:31.204 --> 00:17:32.425]  The courts arbitrate.
[00:17:33.145 --> 00:17:34.485]  The executive arbitrates.
[00:17:35.146 --> 00:17:36.426]  The legislative arbitrates.
[00:17:36.486 --> 00:17:37.346]  That's the Constitution.
[00:17:37.366 --> 00:17:39.547]  I'm going to read you General Milley's letter here.
[00:17:42.537 --> 00:17:48.399]  But do you understand that last night I went home at like eight o'clock and I told my wife, do we have any champagne?
[00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:51.159]  And she said, no, we're not drinking.
[00:17:51.199 --> 00:17:51.479]  Remember?
[00:17:51.499 --> 00:17:52.260]  And I said, you're right.
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.301]  I said, let's go get in the hot tub and let's celebrate.
[00:17:57.381 --> 00:17:59.322]  She said, let me put our three-year-old daughter to bed.
[00:17:59.922 --> 00:18:01.142]  And I did celebrate last night.
[00:18:03.003 --> 00:18:11.085]  Because this is so big, ladies and gentlemen, it's everything we've warned of when it was at the embryonic CFR globulus level.
[00:18:13.345 --> 00:18:17.348]  Then they were dumb enough to still launch it even though we were there being criticized.
[00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:18.168]  What's this loon?
[00:18:18.448 --> 00:18:19.469]  Jones keeps warning.
[00:18:19.529 --> 00:18:20.570]  It's the same show every day.
[00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.991]  They're trying to get the military to overthrow Trump.
[00:18:23.732 --> 00:18:27.294]  Because I know from military sources, not just what the CFR is saying.
[00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:37.318]  And by the way, this has had the effect of taking the military, that's been apolitical in most cases, and really just trying to have a clear head, and absolutely radicalize them.
[00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:45.824]  I mean, here in the UN is going to run the police, the Democrats propose, here in the country shouldn't exist, and then having Democrats come in and give them briefings.
[00:18:46.704 --> 00:18:57.149]  And a lot of people they work with in intelligence agencies who are globalist, coming to them and canvassing them and going through, canvassing for those who don't know, is finding out who you're going to vote for.
[00:18:57.189 --> 00:18:57.989]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.611]  Finding out, hey, you know, we're going to overthrow Trump.
[00:19:01.931 --> 00:19:03.292]  Are you going to be part of that?
[00:19:04.752 --> 00:19:08.534]  So they can make a list of who's going to join them, but also who they got to go after.
[00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:11.976]  And I can tell you the military, 99% told them hell no.
[00:19:15.046 --> 00:19:30.937]  We got a few of the traitors though here who publicly, two colonels that are deep state Democrats who have been the main point people who we now know are running a secret department that Obama is still in control of and they still hail him as the president and are taking orders from him.
[00:19:31.377 --> 00:19:34.880]  Now I told you for a long time about these embedded groups, these stay behind networks.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.321]  I didn't just pull that out of my rear end.
[00:19:36.701 --> 00:19:42.345]  We actually know who's running the operations and I'm going to show you and these are junior people.
[00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:45.974]  They can't even get high-ups to be part of it.
[00:19:47.115 --> 00:19:58.661]  But the junior people have big tech, all the big legacy media, Hollywood, the blue cities and blue states, and the different terrorist mafias they control.
[00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:02.923]  Chi-Com, mafias, MS-13, the list goes on and on.
[00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.290]  So that's what's happening here.
[00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.031]  And America is surrounded by these wolves, surrounded by all these terrorists.
[00:20:11.091 --> 00:20:14.192]  And it's a very, very, very, very serious moment.
[00:20:14.232 --> 00:20:18.992]  So if you're tuning in saying, OK, this is very interesting, very informative, but what's the point?
[00:20:19.833 --> 00:20:26.114]  What's the point is that real knowledge about how the world works is complex and you need to know all of it.
[00:20:26.294 --> 00:20:27.154]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:20:28.234 --> 00:20:33.835]  The Democrats were planning a coup in secret against Trump where they just kill it.
[00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:36.410]  That just grab him and kill him.
[00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:41.392]  And they were trying to get military units that would actually be part of this.
[00:20:41.872 --> 00:20:55.157]  And I'm sitting there hearing about it for the military, then seeing the Democrats try it in white papers, and then externalizing it on the national news, absolutely knowing this is their big move, their big attack.
[00:20:55.877 --> 00:20:57.558]  They've got some other ones as well, I'll tell you about in a moment.
[00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:02.080]  Then I watch it go mainstream in the last month.
[00:21:03.243 --> 00:21:13.070]  The Democrats go mainstream and the New York Times had admit they're going to have states secede and that they're going to take Trump out and they're going to plunge the economy and hold it hostage till we do this.
[00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:18.293]  And I mean, this is like a bank robber with the gun to the head of the clerk saying, I'll blow our brains out if you don't open the safe.
[00:21:18.373 --> 00:21:20.354]  I mean, this is open and shut.
[00:21:20.475 --> 00:21:21.035]  They're done.
[00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:21.855]  They're treasonous.
[00:21:22.096 --> 00:21:22.816]  They're criminals.
[00:21:23.016 --> 00:21:24.097]  They're enemy combatants.
[00:21:24.217 --> 00:21:27.879]  I mean, they are absolutely publicly saying we're terrorists.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.543]  I mean, it's and they're doing it out in the open to try to get
[00:21:33.423 --> 00:21:38.666]  The country, who is now used to, if I'm in the blue, I wear a mask.
[00:21:38.966 --> 00:21:40.708]  I support the end of the economy.
[00:21:40.808 --> 00:21:41.748]  I support no borders.
[00:21:42.048 --> 00:21:43.149]  I support killing police.
[00:21:43.449 --> 00:21:44.890]  I support blowing up police stations.
[00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.352]  I support burning down people's houses.
[00:21:47.652 --> 00:21:50.594]  I support killing old people in COVID nursing centers.
[00:21:50.654 --> 00:21:56.697]  I mean, they've got their followers trained to do absolutely anything.
[00:21:57.197 --> 00:22:01.180]  When the establishment snaps their fingers and tells them how to jump, they do it.
[00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:14.151]  And so then, to have the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs come out in a public letter, send to the Associated Press, because that's the official mouthpiece of the U.S.
[00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:22.815]  government, and say, this is illegal, it's unlawful, we're not going to be part of it, is a total repudiation.
[00:22:23.015 --> 00:22:25.596]  Because they could have privately told these people we're not going to do it.
[00:22:25.997 --> 00:22:32.280]  But when, this is the key, folks, when the deep state threatened Milley with arrest,
[00:22:36.434 --> 00:22:41.257]  See, first they threatened him a month and a half ago and said, you shouldn't have gone to the church with Trump.
[00:22:41.597 --> 00:22:42.757]  The military shouldn't be involved.
[00:22:43.018 --> 00:22:44.158]  And he went, oh yeah, you're right.
[00:22:44.178 --> 00:22:45.199]  I don't want to be used politically.
[00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:47.200]  And I took that as weakness and so did they.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.821]  I said, okay, Milley's going sideways.
[00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:51.142]  And my sources in the Trump administration were like, oh.
[00:22:51.502 --> 00:22:55.484]  But then when they threatened Milley with arrests, I'm going to show you where they did.
[00:22:56.245 --> 00:22:58.406]  And the rest of the brass, they said, F you.
[00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:01.446]  Yeah, you finally found the balls!
[00:23:01.686 --> 00:23:03.708]  Or maybe you had them the whole time and were just playing it cool.
[00:23:04.028 --> 00:23:06.950]  But the point is, you didn't just tell them privately, no.
[00:23:08.491 --> 00:23:11.573]  You went public, and that's what you're supposed to do in the face of traitors.
[00:23:12.314 --> 00:23:13.314]  We're going to win this thing.
[00:23:13.694 --> 00:23:16.576]  And I'm going to tell you, we turned the corner yesterday with this letter.
[00:23:17.117 --> 00:23:20.919]  It's still going to be rough, and they've got some real tricks up their sleeves, I'll tell you about that.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.201]  But let me tell you something right now.
[00:23:24.235 --> 00:23:29.859]  If we hadn't been here, and that means if you hadn't been here, if you hadn't spread the word about Infowars, listen to me.
[00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:32.601]  This isn't about me telling you something to make you feel good.
[00:23:32.781 --> 00:23:34.282]  You need to know how important you are.
[00:23:34.582 --> 00:23:35.462]  Listen to me.
[00:23:36.803 --> 00:23:51.993]  If you hadn't been there, if you hadn't prayed for us, if you hadn't taken action, if you hadn't spread the word, if you hadn't financially supported this broadcast, and if the stations carrying us hadn't done it, we would have lost already.
[00:23:52.013 --> 00:23:52.874]  They already would have killed Trump.
[00:23:54.693 --> 00:23:55.734]  You did it, folks!
[00:23:56.014 --> 00:24:03.318]  You stood up, you took action, and the Pentagon did what they're supposed to do, but they didn't do it silently, which would have been enough.
[00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:06.179]  They did it publicly.
[00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:19.426]  And this is a major repudiation to the toothless, deep state that just has a bunch of talk and a bunch of...
[00:24:21.249 --> 00:24:24.631]  Sparkling glitter and garbage, but none of it is real.
[00:24:24.691 --> 00:24:25.712]  It's smoke and mirrors.
[00:24:26.513 --> 00:24:27.733]  It's a house of mirrors.
[00:24:28.534 --> 00:24:29.394]  It's a fraud.
[00:24:29.775 --> 00:24:31.536]  And the whole thing is coming down.
[00:24:31.916 --> 00:24:32.657]  Are we decadent?
[00:24:32.697 --> 00:24:33.277]  Are we corrupt?
[00:24:33.297 --> 00:24:34.198]  Do we have our own problems?
[00:24:34.238 --> 00:24:35.198]  Is America out of the woods?
[00:24:35.278 --> 00:24:35.478]  No.
[00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:44.524]  But this current nest of conspirators that were in bed with the Chi-Coms and sold us out on purpose and don't just not care about the country.
[00:24:44.544 --> 00:24:45.005]  They hate it.
[00:24:45.425 --> 00:24:49.908]  They are being removed like a face sucker and alien off our body.
[00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:57.966]  And they're kicking and they're screaming and they're pissing and they're shitting on themselves.
[00:24:59.107 --> 00:25:00.007]  And they're squealing.
[00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:05.252]  And it's going to be really bad as they flop around on their death throes politically.
[00:25:07.493 --> 00:25:09.215]  But they're getting their ass handed to them.
[00:25:10.596 --> 00:25:15.199]  Now I'm going to get into Millie's letter and all the rest of it and show you who the coup conspirators are.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.001]  And we have it all.
[00:25:18.502 --> 00:25:18.882]  We have it all.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.421]  And it just gets better as it comes to a head.
[00:25:22.441 --> 00:25:26.402]  But I want to tell you about some of the other stuff coming up in the next hour I'm going to cover.
[00:25:28.203 --> 00:25:35.045]  Rand Paul comes out and he says, I know the group that tried to kill me would have killed me.
[00:25:36.526 --> 00:25:38.427]  Remember, a shooter already tried to kill him once.
[00:25:38.487 --> 00:25:40.267]  He already broke his ribs and punctured his lung.
[00:25:40.307 --> 00:25:41.948]  I mean, he knows when people are trying to kill him.
[00:25:42.248 --> 00:25:42.968]  He doesn't exaggerate.
[00:25:43.168 --> 00:25:44.689]  They're saying, we're going to kill you and try to get at him.
[00:25:46.718 --> 00:25:48.859]  A hundred people around him, another thousand running towards him.
[00:25:48.899 --> 00:25:51.280]  Imagine seeing a thousand plus people running at you saying, we're going to kill you.
[00:25:52.261 --> 00:25:53.281]  You got like 10 cops with you.
[00:25:56.483 --> 00:25:58.364]  He said, we know they're being funded.
[00:25:58.484 --> 00:26:01.065]  All we need is somebody to arrest them and get their orders.
[00:26:01.746 --> 00:26:02.246]  Exactly.
[00:26:02.866 --> 00:26:04.647]  Well, we happen to have the orders to Antifa.
[00:26:05.888 --> 00:26:08.129]  I've been saying that for three years since they fell into our hands.
[00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.170]  Like Death Star plans.
[00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:15.813]  The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
[00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:17.610]  I have them.
[00:26:18.211 --> 00:26:30.778]  So I'm going to have Jamie White, who's posting articles right now, add this original article, when we get to it, to the live feed of the show today about the military refuses to carry out a coup against Trump and exposes it.
[00:26:31.558 --> 00:26:35.900]  I'm going to have this added to it so you can all email it to Senator Paul and maybe they'll pay attention now.
[00:26:36.001 --> 00:26:40.403]  Baltimore to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[00:26:42.104 --> 00:26:42.544]  January 10, 2018.
[00:26:49.983 --> 00:26:52.944]  And it details all the plans.
[00:26:52.984 --> 00:26:58.927]  These are confirmed by Alexander Soros to stage riots nationwide so Obama could stay in power.
[00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:02.889]  They didn't get away with this, but they tried to have blacks rise up and do all this.
[00:27:03.329 --> 00:27:04.329]  So we already have this.
[00:27:04.369 --> 00:27:05.350]  We already know who funds it.
[00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.410]  It's Alexander Soros.
[00:27:11.752 --> 00:27:13.053]  And we need to get this to Senator.
[00:27:14.831 --> 00:27:16.712]  I'm very excited to be here with you at this point.
[00:27:40.973 --> 00:27:41.614]  I'm going to do something.
[00:27:41.654 --> 00:27:46.398]  I'm going to air a special report that is really magnificent titled Crimes Against Humanity.
[00:27:46.438 --> 00:27:47.398]  I'm going to air that in just a moment.
[00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:52.303]  Then when I come back, I'm going to play Hillary saying we're going to contest the election no matter what.
[00:27:53.303 --> 00:27:54.324]  And I'm going to compose myself.
[00:27:54.364 --> 00:27:57.967]  I think we've done a pretty good job the last 25 minutes or so.
[00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.371]  Laying out how big this is.
[00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:06.074]  But I'm going to come back focused and just recap in 60 seconds.
[00:28:06.655 --> 00:28:08.957]  And then I'm going to read to you General Milley's letter.
[00:28:09.912 --> 00:28:12.114]  And then I'm going to show you the conspirators and who they are.
[00:28:15.256 --> 00:28:16.197]  And they're so easy to beat.
[00:28:17.658 --> 00:28:18.299]  Two colonels.
[00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:21.802]  A couple CIA operatives.
[00:28:24.605 --> 00:28:27.806]  And all that money in Hollywood following their orders.
[00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:32.347]  But it's a very small group of people that follow orders from Obama and Hillary.
[00:28:32.707 --> 00:28:40.229]  Obama and Hillary and the Podestas, they get in these roundtable meetings with the Clinton Foundation, and they decide in a vote what they're going to do.
[00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:43.470]  You could fit our enemies in a room.
[00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.831]  And yeah, they're getting money from robber barons and old bankers and the club, what's above them.
[00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:50.592]  But I mean, it's a very small group.
[00:28:51.917 --> 00:28:57.070]  Of people that literally want to keep masks on our faces, force immoculate us, and that's what's coming up next hour.
[00:28:57.611 --> 00:29:00.659]  They're now setting up checkpoints on the highways in blue sectors.
[00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.270]  Where they forcibly take DNA.
[00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:04.191]  Oh, and guess what?
[00:29:04.491 --> 00:29:06.711]  They're getting grants for robots that do it.
[00:29:07.371 --> 00:29:09.552]  So a robot shoves a swab up your nose.
[00:29:09.572 --> 00:29:12.493]  You can't make, it's announced starting tomorrow.
[00:29:13.353 --> 00:29:18.214]  We'll tell you what states are going to have highways shut down as if people are given notice.
[00:29:18.594 --> 00:29:23.695]  And it says, if you come down that highway, you will be directed into a tunnel and we'll have your DNA taken.
[00:29:28.677 --> 00:29:29.837]  So that's coming up.
[00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:38.282]  And we have a huge amount of COVID-19 overblown hoax news.
[00:29:39.463 --> 00:29:42.004]  So I'm going to air this unbelievably important report.
[00:29:42.044 --> 00:29:51.106]  You know, David Icke also at the end of the two hours gave a 16 minute speech in Trafalgar Square under Lord Nelson.
[00:29:53.227 --> 00:29:57.208]  Incredible square with it looked like 20, 30,000, maybe 40,000 people.
[00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:58.929]  Almost no news coverage today.
[00:29:59.329 --> 00:30:01.930]  This just happened like five hours ago, six hours ago.
[00:30:03.397 --> 00:30:13.279]  And he gave this incredible speech, it's posted on Infowars.com, to this cheering crowd of every race, color, and creed exposing the whole hoax.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.740]  That's all coming up as well here today.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.681]  So believe me, you're not going to want to miss this transmission.
[00:30:22.701 --> 00:30:27.102]  And I'm going to tell you again, we will defeat them.
[00:30:27.162 --> 00:30:28.462]  The public is ready to hear the truth.
[00:30:28.522 --> 00:30:29.262]  We're ready to win.
[00:30:29.762 --> 00:30:32.903]  People understand what's happening, but they need to know the next part of the globalist game plan.
[00:30:33.712 --> 00:30:34.633]  They're awake to the New World Order.
[00:30:34.653 --> 00:30:36.034]  They're awake to the forced inoculations.
[00:30:36.294 --> 00:30:37.615]  They're awake to the digital tattoos.
[00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:38.635]  They're awake to the Mark of the Beast.
[00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:42.378]  They're awake to a lot of it, but that took us years to get them to that point.
[00:30:42.898 --> 00:30:49.743]  Now they need to know the next attack and how to stop it very quickly, because you get all these years coming of age.
[00:30:54.775 --> 00:30:54.975]  I think so.
[00:31:19.465 --> 00:31:20.506]  They're ready, folks.
[00:31:21.066 --> 00:31:22.328]  The ground's fertile.
[00:31:22.648 --> 00:31:23.889]  The seeds are in the dirt.
[00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:25.370]  We got the rain.
[00:31:25.891 --> 00:31:26.911]  You see the sunshine.
[00:31:27.032 --> 00:31:28.072]  That's you putting light on it.
[00:31:28.933 --> 00:31:29.834]  How do you put light on it?
[00:31:30.715 --> 00:31:32.697]  You take this live feed and you share it.
[00:31:33.357 --> 00:31:35.279]  And you say, this is the forbidden information.
[00:31:35.619 --> 00:31:36.160]  The U.S.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.343]  military came out and exposed a Democrat coup plot, and so they will not take part of it.
[00:31:41.104 --> 00:31:42.385]  Do you understand how big that is?
[00:31:42.405 --> 00:31:44.547]  Do you understand how huge this is?
[00:31:49.997 --> 00:31:50.759]  The tide's turning.
[00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:53.484]  65 days out.
[00:31:54.566 --> 00:31:55.308]  Thank God.
[00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:57.733]  All the praise and glory goes to God.
[00:31:57.753 --> 00:31:59.717]  Everybody just keep praying and keep thanking God.
[00:32:00.158 --> 00:32:01.340]  Thank you God so much.
[00:32:03.362 --> 00:32:04.602]  Thank you, listeners, for your action.
[00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:05.282]  We're in this together.
[00:32:05.942 --> 00:32:08.763]  I keep saying that because you have to understand, we're not supposed to be on the air now.
[00:32:09.003 --> 00:32:10.003]  We've been under total attack.
[00:32:10.043 --> 00:32:19.825]  They've tried to indict me, 50-something lawsuits, but because of your prayers and your support and the incredible amounts of financial support you've given us, we barely held the enemy back.
[00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:21.165]  That's how it works.
[00:32:21.245 --> 00:32:24.646]  Every time, that's what God takes you right to the edge and gives you just what you need.
[00:32:25.566 --> 00:32:26.986]  Not what you want, what you need.
[00:32:28.226 --> 00:32:31.087]  Like the widow's night in the Bible where she gives the last little penny she has
[00:32:31.923 --> 00:32:32.483]  To the prophet.
[00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:38.645]  And then every day, that little bit of meal, a little bit of oil that her and her daughter would have when they starved to death, was just miraculously there.
[00:32:38.965 --> 00:32:41.806]  And that's an archetype of God gives you just what you need.
[00:32:43.987 --> 00:32:45.087]  Just what you need each time.
[00:32:46.928 --> 00:32:48.068]  Then Rolling Stones rips it off.
[00:32:48.908 --> 00:32:50.929]  You always don't get what you want, but you get what you need.
[00:32:52.009 --> 00:32:53.230]  And Bob Dylan said it right too.
[00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.430]  He said, you know, he served the God of this world for power.
[00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.451]  But now the crossroads, soul to soul.
[00:32:59.309 --> 00:33:00.430]  Well, I sold my soul to somebody else.
[00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.911]  It's not these dirty preachers and all these fake Christians.
[00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:04.031]  You know who God is.
[00:33:04.051 --> 00:33:09.754]  It's a God that gave you life and gave you enjoyment and gave you beauty and gave you all the good things in your children.
[00:33:10.274 --> 00:33:10.895]  That's the God.
[00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:11.575]  The God of life.
[00:33:11.695 --> 00:33:12.535]  I worship that God.
[00:33:13.476 --> 00:33:14.376]  Not the God of death.
[00:33:14.416 --> 00:33:15.797]  Not the God of John Podesta.
[00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.178]  Not the God of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:17.198 --> 00:33:18.478]  Not the God of Lord Rothschild.
[00:33:18.698 --> 00:33:19.959]  Not the God of David Rockefeller.
[00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:20.880]  But the real God.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.540]  The living God.
[00:33:27.298 --> 00:33:28.758]  Here's this incredibly powerful report.
[00:33:28.778 --> 00:33:29.659]  It's at Band.Video.
[00:33:29.699 --> 00:33:31.079]  You can't share Band.Video links.
[00:33:31.159 --> 00:33:31.859]  It's blocked on Twitter.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:38.422]  So you can send it out at censoredbyjack.com.
[00:33:38.442 --> 00:33:40.982]  I'll put that lower third up, censoredbyjack.com.
[00:33:44.023 --> 00:33:45.044]  We also have 2020electioncenter.com.
[00:33:49.741 --> 00:33:51.261]  Those URLs aren't censored for now.
[00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:54.662]  It's the whole catalog of Band Off video, just different URLs to share.
[00:33:55.122 --> 00:33:55.802]  Go get this report.
[00:33:55.822 --> 00:33:56.862]  It's in the Gregory section.
[00:33:56.902 --> 00:33:57.783]  Click the left-hand side.
[00:33:59.163 --> 00:34:00.463]  Crimes against humanity.
[00:34:00.483 --> 00:34:01.803]  This is all public mind control.
[00:34:02.044 --> 00:34:10.605]  And David Icke in his speech pointed out that one of the main British government psychological centers down the street from them in Trafalgar Square is helping run the COVID hoax, the COVID lie.
[00:34:10.985 --> 00:34:13.586]  Yale is doing it with Fauci, and they admit
[00:34:14.477 --> 00:34:27.688]  A huge program on how to brainwash the public and make them believe COVID is super deadly when it's not, and how to make you wear masks and submit ahead of submitting to tracking apps and forced inoculations, which are now being announced in Australia and in
[00:34:28.777 --> 00:34:31.539]  Spain, and which I told you would then come to the United States.
[00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:33.101]  We're first, Hawaii.
[00:34:33.601 --> 00:34:35.202]  Islands, easy to control.
[00:34:35.563 --> 00:34:51.916]  Starting tomorrow, it's on ABC News in Australia, and it's Australian Broadcasting Company, and it's on Your News Now, and on Time Warner in Hawaii, that checkpoints are being set up statewide to forcibly take
[00:34:54.099 --> 00:34:56.240]  A sample to falsely say you have it, of course.
[00:34:56.421 --> 00:34:58.362]  They admit almost all the tests are fake and that's coming out.
[00:34:58.742 --> 00:35:00.463]  So what is their response being exposed as fakes?
[00:35:00.503 --> 00:35:03.946]  To double down, double down with the crowd they've got under their control.
[00:35:04.266 --> 00:35:07.448]  That they can marshal and manipulate and brainwash.
[00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:14.513]  So.
[00:35:14.713 --> 00:35:15.914]  35 minutes into this transmission.
[00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:22.098]  Here is the report and I'm going to come back and recap and then get into it and I'm
[00:35:27.423 --> 00:35:28.564]  At a loss for words, folks.
[00:35:28.584 --> 00:35:36.248]  You have to understand, if we lose this fight, it's not just like we have some jerk government that raises taxes to make us poor, you know, some things suck.
[00:35:36.268 --> 00:35:37.849]  They're going to go for broke at every level.
[00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:40.651]  The lockdown's never going to stop.
[00:35:41.211 --> 00:35:42.812]  It's going to be absolutely nightmarish.
[00:35:42.972 --> 00:35:50.116]  And I mean, I'm not somebody that's a coward, but let me tell you, I mean, I'm fighting hard because I'm fighting for my life.
[00:35:50.556 --> 00:35:53.278]  And I'm particularly in the crosshairs because I knew this was coming.
[00:35:53.298 --> 00:35:53.918]  I stuck my neck out.
[00:35:53.938 --> 00:35:54.719]  I'm glad I did it.
[00:35:54.979 --> 00:35:56.420]  But my Lord, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:35:57.168 --> 00:35:59.109]  Whatever you gotta do to get up off the bench.
[00:35:59.149 --> 00:36:00.409]  And you're the folks tuning in to this show.
[00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:05.471]  Out of the 7.5 million people in the world, you're the few hundred thousand extra people.
[00:36:05.511 --> 00:36:06.691]  Millions tune in to the weekday show.
[00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:07.831]  They're habituated to it.
[00:36:07.871 --> 00:36:08.171]  It's great.
[00:36:09.112 --> 00:36:12.213]  But it's usually a couple hundred thousand tune in to these Saturday and special Sunday shows.
[00:36:12.473 --> 00:36:14.953]  And when you get excited about it and share the links, it could be millions.
[00:36:15.794 --> 00:36:17.434]  And that, it's the new minds we need.
[00:36:17.454 --> 00:36:18.334]  This is an info war.
[00:36:18.354 --> 00:36:19.275]  There's a war over the mind.
[00:36:19.515 --> 00:36:22.976]  We need to maximize and push because we're winning!
[00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:30.974]  But the enemy is going to throw up a bunch of other attacks, and that's an attack on the economy, and the dollar, which is now in full swing.
[00:36:32.535 --> 00:36:37.478]  So the crash is so bad, we're told that they will unleash the economy.
[00:36:38.559 --> 00:36:45.643]  As Big Mike said last week, she said, he said, it said, the thing said, oh, you think things are bad?
[00:36:45.683 --> 00:36:47.384]  You elect Trump again, it'll be a lot worse.
[00:36:47.424 --> 00:36:49.065]  And she's like, I'll break your legs next time.
[00:36:49.946 --> 00:36:51.247]  Well, I'll tell you what, Big Mike,
[00:36:53.097 --> 00:37:00.003]  You take you and your Chicago organizing boyfriend or girlfriend and burn in hell.
[00:37:00.464 --> 00:37:02.766]  Because we're never bowing down to you, you evil thug.
[00:37:03.767 --> 00:37:05.008]  You and your Islamist crap.
[00:37:05.408 --> 00:37:05.869]  You witch.
[00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.171]  You warlock.
[00:37:09.172 --> 00:37:11.614]  So, here's that report.
[00:37:12.695 --> 00:37:13.816]  I'm going to refocus and come back.
[00:37:13.836 --> 00:37:14.436]  This is key.
[00:37:14.476 --> 00:37:14.937]  Stay with us.
[00:37:18.064 --> 00:37:21.167]  Psychology is the scientific study of the mind.
[00:37:21.888 --> 00:37:25.912]  And in an enlightened society, it would be taught in elementary school.
[00:37:26.572 --> 00:37:28.915]  But we are not in an enlightened society.
[00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:36.294]  In simple terms, each human being is made up of three personas, body, mind, and spirit.
[00:37:37.315 --> 00:37:39.296]  Each one with its own desires.
[00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:45.742]  And the universal goal of individual self-mastery is to serve the desire of the spirit.
[00:37:46.702 --> 00:37:53.888]  This takes great discipline, because as we are about to discuss, our mind innately seeks to control us.
[00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.213]  There is psychology, and there is group psychology.
[00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:06.878]  In group psychology, an individual will suppress all desires that are deemed unacceptable by the group.
[00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:13.722]  These suppressed desires will invariably control a person without their knowing.
[00:38:15.143 --> 00:38:16.704]  This knowledge is nothing new.
[00:38:17.525 --> 00:38:24.609]  Machiavelli instructed leaders centuries ago to divide the people into groups in order to weaken and control them.
[00:38:25.854 --> 00:38:28.675]  Those in power have known this for millennia.
[00:38:29.335 --> 00:38:34.117]  The Yoga Sutras outlined a process of overcoming this thousands of years ago.
[00:38:34.737 --> 00:38:42.720]  It taught how a person could become enlightened to the true nature of the mind and liberate themself from unwanted influence.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:51.623]  The ancient writings of Samarra describe a ruling class which kept its power by keeping mankind spiritually repressed.
[00:38:53.461 --> 00:38:57.625]  100 years ago, Sigmund Freud introduced this knowledge to the modern world.
[00:38:58.206 --> 00:39:03.590]  He wrote that the biggest obstacle to liberating yourself from ego was group mind.
[00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:11.437]  Because in order for the individual to examine themselves completely, one must question everything, including the group.
[00:39:12.158 --> 00:39:15.560]  The ego mind has always been obsessed with group identity.
[00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:20.525]  And by nature, it seeks approval or control within the group.
[00:39:22.017 --> 00:39:27.078]  The key to manipulating the masses is to keep them ensnared in group mind.
[00:39:28.259 --> 00:39:38.862]  Freud's work held the key to individual enlightenment and was met with strong disinterest by the ruling class of Vienna who had no interest in the liberation of the individual mind.
[00:39:39.972 --> 00:39:46.777]  Edward Bernays, however, Freud's nephew and protege, found strong interest for his uncle's work in America.
[00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:49.599]  In the early 1900s, the U.S.
[00:39:49.639 --> 00:40:00.647]  government and corporate America employed Bernays not to liberate the individual from group mind, but to keep us enslaved in it and manipulate our thoughts and behavior.
[00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:11.359]  In 1927, Paul Mazur of Lehman Brothers infamously wrote that we must shift America from a needs to a desires culture.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.143]  Man's desires must overshadow his needs.
[00:40:16.044 --> 00:40:21.109]  The overall strategy was to divide the public and stimulate irrational desires.
[00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:24.953]  The only way of achieving this goal was by use of the media.
[00:40:25.573 --> 00:40:32.296]  A new reality was designed with a specific intention of making people more anxious, afraid, and aroused.
[00:40:32.736 --> 00:40:40.559]  Keeping us in an unending, irrational, fight-or-flight state of mind, where we only find solace in group mind conformity.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.461]  All of this has been done without our awareness.
[00:40:45.501 --> 00:40:50.984]  And by 1975, the CIA had infiltrated all areas of news media.
[00:40:51.758 --> 00:41:04.826]  Do you have any people being paid by the CIA who are contributing to a major circulation American journal?
[00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:09.969]  We do have people who submit pieces to American journals.
[00:41:10.129 --> 00:41:18.594]  Do you have any people paid by the CIA who are working for
[00:41:20.473 --> 00:41:21.974]  Television networks.
[00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:31.337]  This, I think, gets into the kind of, uh, getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I'd like to get into in an executive session.
[00:41:31.637 --> 00:41:44.022]  Do you have any people being paid by the CIA who are contributing to the
[00:41:45.283 --> 00:41:48.068]  National News Services.
[00:41:48.949 --> 00:41:50.592]  AP and UPI.
[00:41:52.315 --> 00:41:57.623]  Well, again, I think we're getting into the kind of detail, Mr. Chairman, that I'd prefer to handle in an executive session.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:09.704]  In Russia, Vladislav Surkov, who studied economics and theatre, was tasked with creating a world of fake news to keep the Russian people anxious and confused.
[00:42:10.124 --> 00:42:14.966]  Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theatre.
[00:42:16.206 --> 00:42:25.329]  He used Kremlin money to sponsor all kinds of groups, from mass anti-fascist youth organisations to the very opposite, neo-Nazi skinheads.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.941]  And liberal human rights groups, who then attacked the government.
[00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:37.202]  Surkov even backed whole political parties that were opposed to President Putin.
[00:42:39.322 --> 00:42:44.003]  But the key thing was that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing.
[00:42:45.143 --> 00:42:49.744]  Which meant that no one was sure what was real or what was fake in modern Russia.
[00:42:51.465 --> 00:42:57.926]  As one journalist put it, it's a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused.
[00:42:59.062 --> 00:43:03.703]  A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is indefinable.
[00:43:05.063 --> 00:43:09.104]  These crimes against humanity are more apparent now than ever.
[00:43:09.784 --> 00:43:16.826]  But there are still millions entrenched in group mind who religiously accept the mainstream media narrative to be truth.
[00:43:17.906 --> 00:43:20.287]  Our mind innately seeks to control us.
[00:43:20.947 --> 00:43:25.728]  And if we do not take control of our own mind, the media will control it for us.
[00:43:26.741 --> 00:43:30.843]  The only solution is rugged individualism and critical thinking.
[00:43:31.283 --> 00:43:33.885]  But this is a path that few choose to take.
[00:43:34.605 --> 00:43:39.387]  And so in the meantime, whoever controls the media, controls the herd.
[00:43:40.268 --> 00:43:43.049]  And nothing short of a miracle will ever change that.
[00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.631]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:43:51.308 --> 00:43:52.469]  The year is 2020.
[00:43:53.550 --> 00:44:12.783]  Following several decades of systematically weakening the social, moral, and financial resilience of the American people, the global cabal has launched a series of unimaginable terrorists that have rocked the foundation of Western civilization and has fractured the population of a once united country along increasingly irreconcilable lines.
[00:44:13.324 --> 00:44:19.408]  The nation finds herself on the precipice of all-out civil war, diving headlong towards economic ruin
[00:44:19.789 --> 00:44:23.879]  And already suffocating under the dictatorship of biotechnocratic enslavement.
[00:44:25.102 --> 00:44:27.227]  The final takedown order has been issued.
[00:44:27.548 --> 00:44:28.831]  The direct attack has begun.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.084]  America's greatest trial, and the battle for her survival, is underway.
[00:44:34.845 --> 00:44:40.351]  InfoWars Emergency Transmissions are now broadcasting live weeknights 7 to 9 p.m.
[00:44:40.431 --> 00:44:47.378]  Central Standard Time, Election Countdown, Taking America Back on Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:44:47.579 --> 00:44:50.682]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:44:56.143 --> 00:44:57.043]  It's August 29th.
[00:44:57.203 --> 00:45:00.584]  It's Saturday, 65 days out from the election.
[00:45:01.685 --> 00:45:04.625]  I'll be back tomorrow live again, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:45:05.926 --> 00:45:11.407]  And we're turning the heat up against the globalists and their censorship, their attempts to silence Americans and others.
[00:45:12.107 --> 00:45:17.509]  Owen Schroer's coming in for a new broadcast, Sundays, 6 to 8.
[00:45:18.889 --> 00:45:21.090]  It's called InfoWars Sunday Live.
[00:45:22.301 --> 00:45:34.270]  And as you notice, we've been airing promos so stations can have local break times, but we're not running ads here, ladies and gentlemen, because we are 65 days out and wild horses could not drag me away.
[00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:35.311]  Humanity's on the march.
[00:45:35.772 --> 00:45:37.033]  The globalist empire is on the run.
[00:45:37.053 --> 00:45:38.073]  They're trying to crack down on us.
[00:45:38.153 --> 00:45:38.454]  Okay.
[00:45:41.156 --> 00:45:42.417]  There's a lot of bad news out there.
[00:45:43.592 --> 00:45:54.460]  But the good news is the establishment's cracking down and trying to take over and trying to really use their dirtiest tricks of staged pandemics and lockdowns because they know they're in trouble.
[00:45:59.504 --> 00:46:10.192]  Breaking last night, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, sent a letter to Congress, which the Associated Press broke yesterday afternoon.
[00:46:11.894 --> 00:46:19.317]  Saying we have discovered that the Democrats are pushing a coup plot and we are not going to be part of it.
[00:46:19.337 --> 00:46:25.479]  The military will not be involved removing President Trump and or Joe Biden if he's elected.
[00:46:25.519 --> 00:46:26.399]  That's done to the courts.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.160]  Then he cites the Constitution.
[00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:31.261]  Now obviously the Democrats know that.
[00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:32.762]  We're not in Guatemala.
[00:46:33.592 --> 00:46:34.892]  We're not in North Korea.
[00:46:35.373 --> 00:46:36.673]  We're not in Communist China.
[00:46:36.733 --> 00:46:37.953]  We're not in Nazi Germany.
[00:46:38.474 --> 00:46:43.215]  Bill and Ted's excellent adventure didn't get in a phone booth and send them back to 1944 Nazi Germany.
[00:46:43.836 --> 00:46:47.217]  The military doesn't decide who the president is.
[00:46:47.397 --> 00:46:48.157]  We the people do.
[00:46:50.758 --> 00:46:54.259]  Now they've had a long-term under-the-table strategic operation.
[00:46:54.939 --> 00:46:56.460]  Hell, when Trump got elected,
[00:46:57.401 --> 00:47:02.624]  They sent a lady over from the State Department and she canvassed the Pentagon on overthrowing Trump.
[00:47:02.985 --> 00:47:04.606]  I remember covering that in 2017.
[00:47:06.807 --> 00:47:17.154]  And we also got documents from Sheriff Joe Arpaio from the DEA that they were spying on Trump Tower and on Trump throughout the campaign and on yours truly.
[00:47:17.914 --> 00:47:22.637]  And I knew it was real because it had phone numbers in there that nobody's got from me that I forgot I had.
[00:47:22.697 --> 00:47:23.898]  I forgot I had that office phone.
[00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:25.756]  Back there, I never used.
[00:47:25.836 --> 00:47:27.057]  Wow, why am I paying for that phone line?
[00:47:27.658 --> 00:47:28.499]  I mean, they had them all.
[00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:32.283]  And of course, I put that out in zero coverage.
[00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:35.326]  All you heard was, get Alex Jones off the air!
[00:47:36.207 --> 00:47:42.954]  Because they knew good feds were giving us stuff that we were willing to put out that can get you put out of the jail like Julian Assange.
[00:47:45.094 --> 00:47:48.397]  Well, I'm just doing what's right for freedom, and I'm loyal to the country.
[00:47:48.417 --> 00:47:49.938]  It's the best thing there is out there.
[00:47:49.978 --> 00:47:50.919]  My family's been loyal to it.
[00:47:51.019 --> 00:47:51.860]  I'm loyal to my family.
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:52.881]  So I'm loyal.
[00:47:53.481 --> 00:47:56.424]  Since the Revolutionary War and since the founding of Texas, I am an American.
[00:47:56.944 --> 00:47:57.765]  And I believe in America.
[00:47:57.845 --> 00:47:58.646]  I know you do as well.
[00:47:59.066 --> 00:48:00.587]  I also believe in freedom around this world.
[00:48:01.508 --> 00:48:02.629]  And America hasn't been perfect.
[00:48:02.649 --> 00:48:03.129]  Nobody is.
[00:48:03.149 --> 00:48:06.352]  But compared to the CHICOMS and the New World Order, we are the good guys.
[00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:06.993]  Period.
[00:48:08.474 --> 00:48:10.015]  And people don't like our due process.
[00:48:11.055 --> 00:48:14.276]  They don't like the fact that, you know, people want the freedom we promote.
[00:48:14.576 --> 00:48:15.396]  They can't compete with that.
[00:48:15.416 --> 00:48:16.177]  They want to shut it down.
[00:48:16.577 --> 00:48:19.998]  Well, if they want to shut it down, they're going to have to go through you.
[00:48:20.018 --> 00:48:22.438]  And they're going to have to go through me.
[00:48:24.759 --> 00:48:25.079]  All right.
[00:48:25.139 --> 00:48:26.300]  So let's get into it right now.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.921]  If you just tuned in, here is the earth shaking, massive news.
[00:48:30.961 --> 00:48:31.961]  Greg, bring that to my friend.
[00:48:32.221 --> 00:48:32.581]  Great job.
[00:48:33.242 --> 00:48:34.202]  Gregory, you're kicking ass.
[00:48:35.182 --> 00:48:40.684]  The earth shaking information that they came to the Pentagon.
[00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:45.872]  And they said, we're going to remove Trump when we contest the election.
[00:48:45.912 --> 00:48:47.333]  He's not allowed to counter contest.
[00:48:47.393 --> 00:48:47.974]  Think about that.
[00:48:49.395 --> 00:48:50.276]  Get the Hillary clip ready.
[00:48:51.577 --> 00:48:55.300]  And if you don't support us removing him, you will go to prison.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.482]  They said it on CNN, MSNBC.
[00:48:58.762 --> 00:49:00.103]  They said, we'll kill the president.
[00:49:01.484 --> 00:49:03.126]  Government's going to kill this guy, Phil Mudd.
[00:49:03.766 --> 00:49:05.568]  Used to run the CIA assassination squads.
[00:49:06.128 --> 00:49:06.869]  He didn't do the killing.
[00:49:06.909 --> 00:49:07.509]  He just ran them.
[00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:08.270]  Little coward.
[00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:17.793]  They had Washington Post headlines about how we're going to arrest the cabinet, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, if he doesn't go along with this.
[00:49:21.115 --> 00:49:25.197]  And when they were doing this a month ago, I said, Milley better come out against this or he's with them.
[00:49:26.457 --> 00:49:30.279]  There was already some questions from sources that I know are patriots.
[00:49:31.038 --> 00:49:37.205]  But Milley did the right thing and he issued this letter, which is the shot heard around the world saying it's illegal.
[00:49:37.285 --> 00:49:39.768]  Of course, we're not going to help you remove President Trump.
[00:49:40.469 --> 00:49:47.877]  That is bigger than video as can possibly imagine.
[00:49:48.678 --> 00:49:51.742]  Because if they were going to say no, they do it quietly.
[00:49:53.234 --> 00:49:57.955]  When they were threatening to arrest Millie, saying, when we take over, if you don't help us, we're going to put you in prison.
[00:49:57.975 --> 00:49:59.076]  We control the Justice Department.
[00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.376]  Or at least they think they will.
[00:50:00.676 --> 00:50:02.337]  They've seen all these Trump supporters go to prison.
[00:50:02.737 --> 00:50:06.478]  So when it came time, pucker factor, Millie didn't roll over.
[00:50:06.878 --> 00:50:10.359]  Millie, who's a Green Beret, highly decorated, holding on yards, said, go to hell.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.320]  That's a good thing, isn't it?
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.681]  And you're like, well, he better damn well do that.
[00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:17.441]  Okay, well, are you actually getting death-threatened?
[00:50:17.461 --> 00:50:18.701]  Are you actually getting threatened with prison?
[00:50:19.122 --> 00:50:19.662]  I have been.
[00:50:20.102 --> 00:50:20.502]  And, you know,
[00:50:23.162 --> 00:50:26.123]  The more you give the New World Order the middle finger, the easier it gets to do it.
[00:50:26.544 --> 00:50:32.226]  I'm just glad after decades of seeing nothing but people running for the grass, finally folks standing up.
[00:50:32.246 --> 00:50:34.387]  But that's how it happens, and it's infectious.
[00:50:34.847 --> 00:50:43.331]  And I always believed if I did it, and you did it, and we all just started doing it, that we'd turn the tide.
[00:50:44.672 --> 00:50:46.873]  And some of us might end up, you know, like folks at the Alamo.
[00:50:46.893 --> 00:50:47.533]  Well, that's okay.
[00:50:50.282 --> 00:50:59.850]  There's a patriot and a person that's courage only dies once, the coward dies a thousand times and we need to stop living on our knees and start living on our feet.
[00:51:01.932 --> 00:51:04.494]  You ask why these globals would try all this outlandish stuff?
[00:51:04.674 --> 00:51:05.996]  Because they never get in trouble for it.
[00:51:07.157 --> 00:51:11.941]  They never get in trouble for any of the crap they're pulling, any of the things they're doing.
[00:51:12.001 --> 00:51:16.024]  So, how do you run a coup?
[00:51:16.084 --> 00:51:17.966]  Well, you put it out in the open like it's legitimate.
[00:51:19.312 --> 00:51:25.876]  Like, hey, we're going to send convicted pedophiles over to have your kids bounce on their knee at the local library or public school in the elementary.
[00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:29.018]  If you don't do it, you're homophobic.
[00:51:29.078 --> 00:51:30.298]  It's drag queen story time.
[00:51:30.619 --> 00:51:32.340]  And nobody called them on it, so they did it.
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.921]  When folks started calling them on it, they shut it down.
[00:51:35.661 --> 00:51:41.005]  It's just sickos seeing how much they can piss on your back and tell you it's rain.
[00:51:41.785 --> 00:51:42.145]  That's all.
[00:51:45.307 --> 00:51:46.548]  So Dr. McCamp shot, please.
[00:51:46.568 --> 00:51:47.688]  Let me just show you these articles.
[00:51:47.768 --> 00:51:48.629]  I'm going to go through them for you.
[00:51:51.581 --> 00:51:54.542]  Top General says no role for military in presidential vote.
[00:51:55.103 --> 00:51:56.243]  Why would there be a role?
[00:51:57.164 --> 00:52:04.547]  That's AP spinning the headline, Top General exposes dim plot for coup against Trump.
[00:52:04.847 --> 00:52:05.647]  And I'll read it in a moment.
[00:52:07.488 --> 00:52:07.989]  Top U.S.
[00:52:08.029 --> 00:52:11.090]  General tells Congress the military won't play a role in the 2020 election.
[00:52:12.231 --> 00:52:12.711]  Why would they?
[00:52:13.905 --> 00:52:23.048]  And that's the Democrats telling you, the military's evil, they're backing Trump, oh, they had federal marshals guarding federal buildings, oh my God, this is martial law, it's police state.
[00:52:23.249 --> 00:52:26.890]  Uh, no, guarding a federal building, feds is their role, they better do it.
[00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:37.794]  And the federalist system, this is globalist, this is treason, this is danger, this is, this is police state asking the military to overthrow the president.
[00:52:38.474 --> 00:52:40.315]  It doesn't get more police state than that.
[00:52:40.335 --> 00:52:42.996]  That's what martial law is, is rule by military.
[00:52:44.209 --> 00:52:45.109]  So there's your headlines.
[00:52:45.149 --> 00:52:49.671]  The Democrats asked the Joint Chiefs for martial law to remove Trump and they said no.
[00:52:51.172 --> 00:53:05.497]  The fact that they had the chutzpah, the bravado, the hubris to actually sell this for months and then have it repudiated is just incredible.
[00:53:06.137 --> 00:53:09.879]  But again, after they threatened to arrest the cabinet, I'll show you that in a moment.
[00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:11.791]  I'm going to read you the letter.
[00:53:12.271 --> 00:53:12.632]  Breaking!
[00:53:12.672 --> 00:53:17.716]  Pentagon refuses to interfere in 2020 election after Biden suggests military may remove Trump.
[00:53:18.917 --> 00:53:20.439]  Big article at NationalFile.com.
[00:53:20.459 --> 00:53:21.660]  They have the most lengthy article.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.500]  It's an excellent article.
[00:53:23.281 --> 00:53:24.742]  General Mark Milley, U.S.
[00:53:25.723 --> 00:53:30.387]  military will have no role in resolving a disputed presidential election, Washington Times.
[00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:34.171]  Top general says no role for military in presidential vote.
[00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:40.931]  And here's the key, Hillary Clinton to Biden, don't concede if the election is close.
[00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.071]  She actually said just don't concede.
[00:53:42.091 --> 00:53:47.232]  Now here's what I mentioned to you all those times, look at this headline, Washington Post.
[00:53:52.753 --> 00:54:02.135]  Washington Post, a month ago, Trump could lose and not leave, but cabinet members who try to help face prison.
[00:54:03.447 --> 00:54:10.133]  So, they're saying, we're going to contest the election as Democrats, but if you contest, anyone that helps you contest will face prison.
[00:54:13.435 --> 00:54:19.340]  And Milley got the call, the Democrats sent him a letter, that's in his letter, saying, are you going to be part of this?
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.662]  Are you going to be with Trump if he contested?
[00:54:21.943 --> 00:54:24.865]  Because if you are, well, you saw the Washington Post piece.
[00:54:27.367 --> 00:54:28.108]  God Almighty.
[00:54:30.145 --> 00:54:32.626]  These thugs have never had anybody push back against them.
[00:54:32.966 --> 00:54:33.686]  These goons.
[00:54:35.486 --> 00:54:37.367]  And they've now gotten to this point.
[00:54:37.427 --> 00:54:42.888]  So, let's go ahead and read, even CNN hates this, having a report on this, from the letter.
[00:54:44.029 --> 00:54:44.469]  Top U.S.
[00:54:44.509 --> 00:54:47.070]  General tells Congress the military won't play a role in the 2020 election.
[00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:49.270]  This is from Milley's letter.
[00:54:50.571 --> 00:54:59.453]  America's most senior general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, told members of Congress that the military will not play a role in November's election and won't help settle any disputes
[00:55:00.871 --> 00:55:02.292]  The results have contested.
[00:55:03.692 --> 00:55:05.713]  Yeah, they're like Tiananmen Square, 1989.
[00:55:05.753 --> 00:55:08.374]  Let's roll some of that footage if you can find it.
[00:55:08.714 --> 00:55:13.516]  Like when the Communist Party called the military in on democracy demonstrators.
[00:55:13.556 --> 00:55:17.417]  I mean, that's what the Democrats want, is Tiananmen Square, but against the president.
[00:55:18.738 --> 00:55:19.918]  And you're like, this is insane.
[00:55:20.378 --> 00:55:21.899]  It's all insane, folks.
[00:55:22.139 --> 00:55:23.420]  Biden can't even talk.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.941]  The whole Russiagate, spying on the president, all this crap.
[00:55:28.353 --> 00:55:30.374]  They didn't just spy, they forged documents.
[00:55:30.595 --> 00:55:37.119]  They have House Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee, House Armed Services Committee saying, Obama officials, I'm a Russian.
[00:55:39.561 --> 00:55:47.346]  You know, there's probably not one out of 100,000 Americans out there that's got a family that actually fought Russians in the 70s and 80s.
[00:55:48.507 --> 00:55:49.147]  My family did.
[00:55:49.988 --> 00:55:56.693]  So that's another little sick joke from the establishment to say, my family was with the Russians.
[00:55:57.925 --> 00:56:00.027]  That's a sick little joke by them.
[00:56:00.067 --> 00:56:00.627]  You know that, right?
[00:56:00.947 --> 00:56:01.408]  They're the globalists.
[00:56:01.428 --> 00:56:02.508]  They hate the country even existing.
[00:56:02.528 --> 00:56:09.733]  I have family in Germany and family in Latin America fighting the Russians in the 1970s and 80s.
[00:56:10.254 --> 00:56:10.634]  On record.
[00:56:11.494 --> 00:56:14.076]  And these people sit there and say, I'm a Russian agent.
[00:56:14.356 --> 00:56:15.357]  No, they're the globalist agents.
[00:56:15.397 --> 00:56:15.817]  Let's continue.
[00:56:16.738 --> 00:56:18.879]  The Constitution and laws of the U.S.
[00:56:18.939 --> 00:56:22.282]  and states establish procedures, this is Milley, for carrying out elections.
[00:56:23.345 --> 00:56:25.346]  And for resolving disputes over the outcome of elections.
[00:56:25.607 --> 00:56:26.827]  I do not see the U.S.
[00:56:26.847 --> 00:56:28.449]  military as part of this process.
[00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:36.634]  The military said, really said in a letter released Friday, responding to questions from two members of the House Armed Services Committee, who we'll look at in a moment.
[00:56:37.595 --> 00:56:42.639]  In the event, he said, of a dispute over some aspect of the elections, by law, U.S.
[00:56:43.139 --> 00:56:44.200]  courts and the U.S.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.323]  Congress are required to resolve any disputes, not the U.S.
[00:56:48.343 --> 00:56:48.783]  military.
[00:56:48.823 --> 00:56:49.003]  Yeah.
[00:56:49.363 --> 00:56:50.164]  Power of impeachment.
[00:56:52.059 --> 00:56:53.240]  Power of the Supreme Court.
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:58.024]  Milley added, I believe deeply in the principle of an apolitical U.S.
[00:56:58.044 --> 00:56:58.864]  military, Milley wrote.
[00:57:00.706 --> 00:57:06.130]  Milley's answers came in response to questions from Democrat Representatives Alyssa Slotkin.
[00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:08.191]  We'll tell you about her in a moment.
[00:57:11.514 --> 00:57:17.258]  Of Michigan and Mickey Sherrill of New Jersey following a July hearing of the Armed Services Committee.
[00:57:18.559 --> 00:57:20.821]  The AP was first to report on Milley's letter.
[00:57:22.042 --> 00:57:47.228]  The idea of having the military get involved in the event of President Trump refusing to vacate the office of the president after losing the 2020 election was floated by Trump opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, during a June interview on The Daily Show when he was asked what would happen should Trump resist leaving office after an election defeat.
[00:57:48.476 --> 00:57:50.818]  Now this has already been the CFR, Foreign Affairs, this plan.
[00:57:50.858 --> 00:57:52.239]  He was just saying this because that's their plan.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.221]  He didn't just say this off the top of his head, he's a puppet.
[00:57:54.842 --> 00:58:03.789]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced, they will escort him from the White House, the Great Dispatch, Biden said, referring to the U.S.
[00:58:03.809 --> 00:58:09.214]  Military Joint Chiefs of Staff, Esper in a crisis management mode amongst turmoil of Trump's re-election campaign.
[00:58:09.594 --> 00:58:15.880]  Other high-profile Democrats, including the party's 2016 nominee, Hillary Clinton, have also speculated that Trump might
[00:58:16.909 --> 00:58:25.698]  Well, yeah, if there's a disputed election result, he's going to dispute it.
[00:58:26.038 --> 00:58:29.362]  So again, they're saying they're going to dispute no matter what, because they know they're going to lose.
[00:58:29.622 --> 00:58:31.945]  But if he disputes their dispute, military takes him out.
[00:58:38.376 --> 00:58:39.677]  Telling Fox News in July?
[00:58:39.837 --> 00:58:40.437]  I have to see.
[00:58:40.477 --> 00:58:40.977]  I have to look.
[00:58:41.397 --> 00:58:42.218]  I have to see.
[00:58:42.638 --> 00:58:43.959]  I'm not just going to say yes.
[00:58:43.999 --> 00:58:45.159]  I'm not just going to say no.
[00:58:45.699 --> 00:59:05.068]  And I didn't, last time either, concern that Trump may not vacate the presidency after losing the election, drove two well-known retired military officers, John Nagel and Paul Yemling, to pen an open letter to Milley calling on him to get involved in resolving contested aftermath.
[00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:06.889]  That's calling for a military coup, folks.
[00:59:07.569 --> 00:59:24.059]  If Donald Trump refuses to leave office at the expiration of his constitutional term, the United States military must remove him by force and you must give that order, the two retired lieutenant colonels said in their message to America's top military officer, which was published by Defense One.
[00:59:25.639 --> 00:59:27.841]  Now, again, let me explain the calculus here.
[00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:30.102]  I'm sure you're getting it, but this is, this is everything.
[00:59:30.302 --> 00:59:31.383]  This is their whole attack.
[00:59:31.723 --> 00:59:33.524]  It's what's going to happen in 65 days.
[00:59:33.604 --> 00:59:34.144]  It's everything.
[00:59:34.384 --> 00:59:35.025]  This is everything.
[00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:38.614]  I'll show you their side attacks in a moment, but this is the big one.
[00:59:39.615 --> 00:59:41.197]  They contest when they lose.
[00:59:41.918 --> 00:59:42.879]  Trump contests.
[00:59:43.619 --> 00:59:50.966]  Then they hold the economy hostage, burn down the cities, and say it's Trump's fault, and tell the military to remove him because they've already pre-programmed.
[00:59:51.427 --> 00:59:52.628]  Oh, he's going to contest.
[00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:54.670]  You're not allowed to contest.
[00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:55.551]  We've got to remove him.
[00:59:58.574 --> 00:59:59.575]  And they're still going to do this.
[01:00:03.646 --> 01:00:09.289]  And they sent out the 80 million ballots to gum everything up, knowing it's a total sabotage.
[01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:20.134]  Sabotage comes from taking your sandal and sticking it in the machine of your worker, and it messes up the gums of the work, so the factory breaks for a few days while they gotta fix it so you can, you know, go out as an anarchist and smoke cigarettes or whatever.
[01:00:20.854 --> 01:00:21.735]  Sabotage!
[01:00:21.815 --> 01:00:22.315]  Sabos!
[01:00:22.675 --> 01:00:23.356]  Sabotage!
[01:00:24.756 --> 01:00:25.977]  And so, that's all this is!
[01:00:32.363 --> 01:00:49.231]  While both Nagao and Yingling, well-known in military circles for their writings and scholarship on America's recent conflicts, their advocacy for having the armed forces get involved in settling a disputed election prompted backlash from both the Pentagon and other experts in the field of civilian-military relations.
[01:00:50.231 --> 01:00:53.953]  And it goes on to say, this is third world, this is dictatorship, this is illegal.
[01:00:54.473 --> 01:00:54.773]  Okay.
[01:00:56.434 --> 01:00:59.856]  Now I'll tell you about those two military officers here in a moment.
[01:01:00.933 --> 01:01:03.775]  And who they're involved with and who they work for, but you can probably get a good idea.
[01:01:05.136 --> 01:01:05.977]  They're not for America.
[01:01:06.017 --> 01:01:06.797]  That's very clear.
[01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:11.160]  But that's where we are on this Saturday afternoon.
[01:01:13.662 --> 01:01:16.684]  And then we'll re-air this as a loop until we're live again at 4 p.m.
[01:01:16.704 --> 01:01:17.024]  tomorrow.
[01:01:18.345 --> 01:01:25.190]  But your homework really is telling folks to tune in and to share this video once it's archived, once we're not live from Bandai Video.
[01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:26.811]  But again, that's not allowed to be shared from Twitter.
[01:01:26.831 --> 01:01:30.534]  So you need to share it from a few URLs we'll put on screen for you in a little while.
[01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:41.616]  They don't let you share that, so you need to share the URL from censoredbyjack.com and 2020electioncenter.com.
[01:01:43.757 --> 01:01:46.560]  Those are full scrapes of Van Dodd videos.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.282]  You can send them out by link, individual videos, and not be censored.
[01:01:49.883 --> 01:01:51.264]  Censoredbyjack.com.
[01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:53.956]  All right, let's continue here.
[01:01:54.036 --> 01:02:06.987]  So here we are with the huge seismic historical response to these members of Congress, who are special members put in by Obama as he was leaving, that we're not going to put up with this.
[01:02:07.468 --> 01:02:08.909]  Now let's look at who these individuals are.
[01:02:11.932 --> 01:02:17.817]  Alyssa Slotkin just got elected to Congress right after Obama left.
[01:02:19.741 --> 01:02:22.402]  January 20th, the day Trump's inaugurated.
[01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:24.243]  She is inaugurated.
[01:02:24.404 --> 01:02:27.945]  And look at that pile of vomit.
[01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:37.171]  Alyssa Blair Slotkin, born 1976, is a former CIA analyst.
[01:02:37.931 --> 01:02:41.033]  She's so fat she can't even wipe her ass, but she's an analyst.
[01:02:41.493 --> 01:02:42.673]  Serving as the U.S.
[01:02:42.714 --> 01:02:45.295]  Representative for Michigan's 8th Congressional District.
[01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:54.228]  She was Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs.
[01:02:54.268 --> 01:02:58.129]  That means selling America out till 2017 when Obama left.
[01:02:58.389 --> 01:02:59.469]  So she got pissed about that.
[01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:01.530]  Then she got into Congress in 2019.
[01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:02.770]  Let me correct that.
[01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:09.532]  So she works directly for Obama and Hillary, selling the country out and John Kerry.
[01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:17.894]  And she's the one sending out letters to the Pentagon
[01:03:20.501 --> 01:03:24.803]  Days after they threatened to arrest Milley if he doesn't aid in the coup.
[01:03:27.144 --> 01:03:28.505]  This is the sack of garbage.
[01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:29.785]  Let's look at her again.
[01:03:30.606 --> 01:03:31.606]  She's not going to do any fighting.
[01:03:31.626 --> 01:03:33.527]  She's just going to stir everything up and have us all kill each other.
[01:03:35.128 --> 01:03:36.488]  Then you've got this sack of garbage.
[01:03:38.229 --> 01:03:39.490]  Seven freshman Democrats.
[01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:42.351]  These allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect.
[01:03:42.391 --> 01:03:43.892]  They helped launch the impeachment.
[01:03:44.512 --> 01:03:49.174]  Alyssa Slotkin from Michigan and Abigail Spanberger.
[01:03:52.793 --> 01:04:05.636]  So again, it's the same individuals over and over again that are sending out Washington Post headlines that if the cabinet officials don't help remove Trump in a contested election, you will face prison.
[01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:16.858]  And I guess if you want to live on your knees to these, you know, fat women, I mean, nothing against them.
[01:04:17.038 --> 01:04:20.559]  There's just something about like a 400 pound woman just telling you, you got to bow to me.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.380]  So there you go.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.461]  Let's look at some of these other people.
[01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:31.484]  Let's look at these generals that are being threatened here by these colonels that are saying, we want the military to take Trump out.
[01:04:32.845 --> 01:04:38.868]  You know, if I was organizing a military to take out the president, I'd expect the FBI to be kicking my doors down.
[01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:39.368]  They should be.
[01:04:39.388 --> 01:04:41.089]  You know, battering rams, SWAT teams.
[01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:42.090]  But, oh, oh no!
[01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:43.351]  Oh, you work for Obama?
[01:04:43.611 --> 01:04:45.532]  Oh, you go ahead and organize a military coup.
[01:04:46.522 --> 01:04:51.384]  And threaten the front page of the Washington Post to have his cabinet and General Milley arrested if they don't bow to you.
[01:04:51.684 --> 01:04:53.985]  And let me tell you, they put a lot of folks in prison.
[01:04:54.825 --> 01:04:56.006]  They're carrying these threats out.
[01:04:56.586 --> 01:04:58.267]  You really are supposed to respond to that.
[01:05:00.108 --> 01:05:03.069]  But will the mouse make the lion of the U.S.
[01:05:03.089 --> 01:05:03.949]  military a coward?
[01:05:04.289 --> 01:05:04.629]  I don't know.
[01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:06.110]  They haven't made Trump a coward yet.
[01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:09.091]  It looks like Milley may actually have a couple eggs in his pants.
[01:05:10.692 --> 01:05:12.553]  Retired Army officers echo dim
[01:05:13.567 --> 01:05:13.867]  Coup.
[01:05:14.107 --> 01:05:17.028]  Military must forcibly remove Trump if he loses the election.
[01:05:18.849 --> 01:05:21.089]  That's us reporting on that back on August of this year.
[01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:30.452]  And it's the same people, the same members of Congress, one of them CIA, put in by Obama to do this.
[01:05:33.233 --> 01:05:34.393]  All enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:05:34.413 --> 01:05:39.655]  An open letter to General Milley where Trump's the domestic enemy and must be removed.
[01:05:42.409 --> 01:05:45.691]  So I've spent an hour here.
[01:05:46.332 --> 01:05:58.480]  We got about 55 minutes left covering this and you know, somebody can wreck your bicycle and it gets 20 million views.
[01:06:00.239 --> 01:06:03.340]  Or some Hollywood star can have their breasts pop out and it gets 100 million views.
[01:06:03.841 --> 01:06:23.329]  But the only way this gets out, the only way the information that there has been an attempted canvassing, a solicitation for a military illegal coup against the President, when the Democrats contest their loss, Trump challenges it, they're saying that's illegal, military must remove you, if they don't we're going to arrest the military.
[01:06:24.892 --> 01:06:30.253]  Well, when people criminally threaten you and are engaged in criminal activity, what do you do?
[01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:31.513]  I fight back.
[01:06:34.674 --> 01:06:38.295]  I fight back when the Democrats convene grand juries and they're trying to have me indicted.
[01:06:39.155 --> 01:06:41.295]  Not because I'm a tough guy, but because I'm not a slave.
[01:06:42.355 --> 01:06:44.016]  When I'm held underwater, I fight for my life.
[01:06:44.536 --> 01:06:44.836]  That's all.
[01:06:45.736 --> 01:06:51.117]  And if the general public will just get its instincts to stand up and be engaged and be involved, we'll win.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:07:06.384]  Now I have all this incredible, and when I say incredible, I mean absolutely incredible COVID-19 news that is just staggering beyond belief.
[01:07:06.404 --> 01:07:07.384]  But then I have the good news.
[01:07:07.804 --> 01:07:15.727]  In the last 16 minutes of the broadcast, David Icke today gave a powerful 16-minute speech in Trafalgar Square.
[01:07:22.389 --> 01:07:23.449]  And I'm just lucky to know him.
[01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:26.390]  I'm looking to know all you, and I'm lucky to be in this fight with you.
[01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:27.170]  And I love you so much.
[01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:28.671]  I love humanity.
[01:07:29.631 --> 01:07:31.911]  They teach us to hate each other, but they want to take it away from us, folks.
[01:07:33.472 --> 01:07:34.192]  You got to fight for it.
[01:07:34.752 --> 01:07:37.093]  Full videos at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:07:37.673 --> 01:07:40.534]  David Icke scorched his establishment during anti-lockdown rally in London.
[01:07:41.174 --> 01:07:42.634]  It's got to be 40,000 there, man.
[01:07:42.894 --> 01:07:43.514]  I've been in that square.
[01:07:43.534 --> 01:07:43.954]  It's huge.
[01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:47.015]  That's just from where this camera was.
[01:07:47.055 --> 01:07:48.035]  The square keeps going back.
[01:07:49.776 --> 01:07:49.976]  So
[01:07:52.674 --> 01:07:54.035]  Which is going to be in there with them.
[01:07:54.095 --> 01:07:54.755]  That's coming up.
[01:07:57.918 --> 01:07:59.279]  Let me put some bookends on this.
[01:07:59.499 --> 01:08:00.800]  I mean, do I need to show you the proof?
[01:08:03.922 --> 01:08:08.045]  Here's Hillary saying what I told you a year ago they were planning.
[01:08:08.865 --> 01:08:10.286]  And what was confirmed a few months ago.
[01:08:10.727 --> 01:08:12.068]  That they're going to have states to see.
[01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:15.110]  They're going to contest no matter what, because they know they're losing.
[01:08:16.485 --> 01:08:23.348]  And then again, when Trump contests the contention, legally and lawfully, they're saying it's illegal and military aren't going to stop him.
[01:08:23.388 --> 01:08:27.230]  Like, like, like they can just fool the military, like they fool the general public about this.
[01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:33.273]  I mean, COVID kills .0032 with fake numbers added.
[01:08:33.293 --> 01:08:40.597]  And I was sitting there talking to a family friend yesterday and he goes, well, I have a friend died of COVID.
[01:08:40.837 --> 01:08:41.477]  I go, how old is he?
[01:08:41.497 --> 01:08:41.477]  85?
[01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:41.737]  He goes, no, 87.
[01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:42.397]  And he had cancer.
[01:08:48.922 --> 01:08:51.404]  And I looked at the guy and I said, do you really buy all this?
[01:08:51.424 --> 01:08:52.706]  The guy's a professionally smart.
[01:08:53.526 --> 01:08:55.368]  He goes, Alex, I'm 65 years old.
[01:08:55.428 --> 01:08:56.289]  I'm setting my ways.
[01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:59.352]  This has been going on for 6,000 years.
[01:08:59.412 --> 01:08:59.912]  I can't stop.
[01:08:59.952 --> 01:09:01.594]  He goes, of course, I know it's all crap.
[01:09:05.397 --> 01:09:11.443]  But see, people like that who are nice folks, but still, they've been conforming their whole lives and getting ahead.
[01:09:13.038 --> 01:09:13.699]  And it's worked.
[01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:15.100]  That's all over now!
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:18.222]  Conform and get your ass dead like a person in the third world.
[01:09:18.782 --> 01:09:21.884]  Because in America, we demanded high standards.
[01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:23.225]  We demanded wealth.
[01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:24.326]  We demanded this.
[01:09:24.566 --> 01:09:25.767]  Most places don't do that!
[01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:40.718]  And so, when we act like chumps and weaklings and are docile and follow orders that are illegal, we are transformed from free men into slaves overnight.
[01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:45.261]  Slaves love their chains in China.
[01:09:46.722 --> 01:09:54.228]  The left loves defending China and their millions in death camps because they're weak people we put up with that we let bosses around.
[01:09:54.468 --> 01:09:59.192]  And so now they are pretending they're authoritarian chi-com potent-ites.
[01:10:01.133 --> 01:10:01.533]  Well, they're not.
[01:10:02.634 --> 01:10:10.621]  Well, I'm a red-blooded American, like those that came before me, and I refuse to bow to this because I am superior, not because I'm white,
[01:10:11.601 --> 01:10:19.307]  But because I come from a line of people that stood up and left tyranny and built something better that everyone wanted a piece of because they knew it was better.
[01:10:19.508 --> 01:10:21.189]  And America is superior!
[01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:23.491]  And our republic is amazing!
[01:10:24.031 --> 01:10:25.373]  And we are Excelsior!
[01:10:26.414 --> 01:10:35.058]  And we can be brown, we can be black, we can be white, but because we believe in rugged individualism and freedom, we are superior, because that builds superior people!
[01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:35.938]  Period!
[01:10:36.819 --> 01:10:38.920]  I am a human supremacist!
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.621]  I am an American supremacist!
[01:10:42.241 --> 01:10:50.425]  And I don't want to dominate you in my supremacy, I want to build everyone up, because as Kennedy said, a rising tide raises all ships!
[01:10:50.725 --> 01:10:51.906]  And that's what I stand for!
[01:10:52.566 --> 01:10:58.954]  And I say stop living on your knees, start living on your feet, and say FREEDOM!
[01:11:01.598 --> 01:11:02.459]  But here's Hillary Clinton.
[01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:07.266]  She's going to contest because she's part of the Biden council.
[01:11:07.286 --> 01:11:07.827]  It's a council.
[01:11:08.628 --> 01:11:10.089]  She's going to contest, but Trump can't.
[01:11:10.289 --> 01:11:10.630]  Here it is.
[01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:18.237]  Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out.
[01:11:18.857 --> 01:11:28.807]  And eventually, I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is.
[01:11:29.574 --> 01:11:33.817]  The fact is, whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving.
[01:11:34.597 --> 01:11:44.003]  Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected President of the United States.
[01:11:44.323 --> 01:11:45.544]  But there is a process.
[01:11:45.824 --> 01:11:54.209]  It has nothing to do with that the certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency
[01:11:54.807 --> 01:11:54.927]  Yes.
[01:12:15.382 --> 01:12:16.303]  His military?
[01:12:16.743 --> 01:12:18.124]  Is he going to engage us?
[01:12:18.384 --> 01:12:23.767]  He has already alluded to there may be a civil war if he's not re-elected.
[01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:24.988]  This is dangerous.
[01:12:25.448 --> 01:12:27.850]  We are trying to find out more about it.
[01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:37.716]  And sadly, the domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring our Constitution are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:12:37.956 --> 01:12:39.557]  It's really actually shameful.
[01:12:39.877 --> 01:12:41.258]  Enemies of the state.
[01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:43.248]  Alright, that's enough of this.
[01:12:43.268 --> 01:12:45.829]  I mean, you see and you get what they're doing again, right?
[01:12:46.109 --> 01:12:52.290]  They say have the military remove Trump, while at the same time saying Trump's got the military and he's going to use them on us.
[01:13:12.025 --> 01:13:18.108]  So they bully the military, you're bad, you're gonna go to prison, I'm gonna do what we say, we're already setting you up as a bad guy, hey, join us, it'll be okay.
[01:13:19.089 --> 01:13:23.331]  I mean, it's just low down, it's dirty, and it disrespects you like you're stupid.
[01:13:26.153 --> 01:13:30.155]  And they're still gonna try all this, but to have the military come out and tell them no is key.
[01:13:30.475 --> 01:13:34.278]  Now, Rand Paul came out, and he said something really, really important.
[01:13:34.858 --> 01:13:38.480]  He said, we know that these criminals, Antifa, are being funded to attack people.
[01:13:40.503 --> 01:13:43.224]  But we need to get the documents of how they're doing it and charge them with racketeering.
[01:13:43.505 --> 01:13:45.406]  Well, it turns out we have the documents.
[01:13:47.247 --> 01:13:49.428]  So I tell you, I was going to air the David Icke thing at the end.
[01:13:49.928 --> 01:13:50.628]  I think it's best.
[01:13:50.648 --> 01:13:52.389]  This is really powerful from Trafalgar Square.
[01:13:52.409 --> 01:13:54.250]  It's 16 minutes long to air it now.
[01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:58.433]  And when I come back, I'll hit the COVID-19 news that ties into the whole lockdown.
[01:13:58.473 --> 01:13:59.453]  It's all part of the same group.
[01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:01.895]  Same operation is to get you ready for martial law.
[01:14:03.015 --> 01:14:05.016]  It hurt the economy to blame Trump and nationalism.
[01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:06.037]  And then I'll hit the
[01:14:08.134 --> 01:14:12.339]  Proof that Rand Paul needs to get the Antifa leadership, Alexander Soros, arrested.
[01:14:17.724 --> 01:14:21.408]  So this is all coming up here today.
[01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:24.512]  And I cannot stress to you enough how
[01:14:25.922 --> 01:14:29.706]  You already know about this information, but your friends, your neighbors, your family don't.
[01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:30.927]  They're primed to hear the truth.
[01:14:31.248 --> 01:14:32.029]  They're awake now.
[01:14:32.049 --> 01:14:35.913]  No one's been more receptive to our information than it is now with the mass censorship, the control.
[01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:40.177]  You go out there, our positive mentions like 90% now used to be 50-50.
[01:14:40.498 --> 01:14:43.060]  People get now that, oh, this guy wasn't trying to scare me.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.542]  He was trying to warn me to mobilize me.
[01:14:44.802 --> 01:14:45.283]  Damn right!
[01:14:49.397 --> 01:14:54.260]  I mean, when I'm driving down the road, this happened like 10 years ago, we had really bad wildfires here in Austin or nine, eight, nine years ago.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.381]  And there was just fires all around you.
[01:14:56.782 --> 01:15:02.645]  And then one time I was driving and the fire department was closing the road and they said, Hey, you got to go around, use this road, you know, to get where you live.
[01:15:02.845 --> 01:15:05.787]  There's fire coming across the road.
[01:15:05.807 --> 01:15:09.669]  And I didn't say, how dare you try to scare me?
[01:15:09.729 --> 01:15:10.410]  I said, well, thank you.
[01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:18.435]  And I drove through there a couple of weeks later and they had just down the road and jumped the road and burned all these cars and houses down.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.861]  And they had helicopters dumping stuff on it, right?
[01:15:21.941 --> 01:15:24.302]  I couldn't see it over the hill, but literally, they were stopping me.
[01:15:24.342 --> 01:15:25.943]  I was about to drive into flames.
[01:15:26.663 --> 01:15:27.784]  That night, it burned down.
[01:15:28.084 --> 01:15:28.844]  It was happening then.
[01:15:31.065 --> 01:15:31.906]  They weren't fear-mongering.
[01:15:31.926 --> 01:15:33.347]  They were like, hey, uh, you need to go around.
[01:15:33.367 --> 01:15:35.848]  You can already see the smoke, ash, everything.
[01:15:35.868 --> 01:15:37.769]  They were like, oh, there's a fire down the road.
[01:15:37.789 --> 01:15:38.569]  You can't go this way.
[01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:40.990]  I didn't say, screw you, you're lying to me.
[01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:41.831]  I just, I believed them.
[01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.031]  I turned around and went around the other way.
[01:15:44.392 --> 01:15:46.133]  And I had ashes raining down at my house.
[01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:47.834]  Even then, from like a mile away, it was so bad.
[01:15:50.418 --> 01:15:53.779]  But that's what I'm saying is, believe people you talk to individually.
[01:15:53.819 --> 01:15:55.320]  Don't believe the mainstream media folks.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.261]  Because they will lie like the devil.
[01:16:00.983 --> 01:16:05.925]  Like I saw examples in the CNN said none of the men were armed that got shot by Rittenhouse.
[01:16:06.565 --> 01:16:08.706]  And it's on record at least one of them did have a gun aimed at him.
[01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:13.108]  I mean, if you read this, you've got to check into it's all I'm saying.
[01:16:13.528 --> 01:16:14.568]  And check into what we say.
[01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:17.910]  And you'll find out we're telling you the truth, except we make a mistake here and there.
[01:16:18.715 --> 01:16:19.936]  My God, all I've got is the truth.
[01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:23.459]  I love the truth so much, now I just worship it, quite frankly.
[01:16:23.479 --> 01:16:25.821]  I don't like God, but I'm really into the truth.
[01:16:27.153 --> 01:16:27.413]  Okay.
[01:16:27.693 --> 01:16:29.394]  Here's this report from Trafalgar Square.
[01:16:29.555 --> 01:16:30.275]  Very powerful.
[01:16:30.295 --> 01:16:31.656]  I love the folks that are introducing him.
[01:16:31.736 --> 01:16:32.757]  I love everything that's happening.
[01:16:33.237 --> 01:16:39.021]  If you're a radio listener, it looks like 40,000 people to me because I saw some photographs from back further.
[01:16:39.401 --> 01:16:41.963]  The camera person is about halfway into the crowd.
[01:16:42.043 --> 01:16:43.283]  So it goes way back.
[01:16:43.844 --> 01:16:45.145]  Looks like a rock concert.
[01:16:46.546 --> 01:16:50.528]  Probably as big a crowd as we had in Virginia, maybe bigger with the gun rally in January.
[01:16:50.808 --> 01:16:54.631]  They've had crowds of a million in Germany, half a million in Madrid.
[01:16:56.007 --> 01:16:57.327]  Half a million in other areas.
[01:16:57.347 --> 01:16:58.408]  What was the other place?
[01:16:58.428 --> 01:17:01.509]  It was in Italy, in Freidwich Town.
[01:17:01.949 --> 01:17:03.689]  So it's very, very exciting what's going on.
[01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:04.530]  We're going to air that.
[01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:06.110]  Everybody's hugging.
[01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:06.990]  Everybody's loving each other.
[01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:10.611]  And again, it's .0032, folks, in the U.S.
[01:17:12.992 --> 01:17:13.492]  It's made up.
[01:17:13.652 --> 01:17:15.153]  You'll be like, well, I know somebody died.
[01:17:15.193 --> 01:17:16.253]  Yeah, people die all the time, man.
[01:17:19.278 --> 01:17:22.640]  And Bill Gates has said, you put up with this, the next pandemic is going to be a lot worse.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:26.243]  This is a lockdown test of what you'll do during the big one they're going to launch.
[01:17:26.623 --> 01:17:27.483]  And everybody knows it.
[01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:28.584]  Everybody understands it.
[01:17:30.005 --> 01:17:36.709]  So I'm going to come back with the checkpoints starting tomorrow on major highways in blue states.
[01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:39.571]  Forcibly testing you.
[01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:40.772]  Mainstream news.
[01:17:41.072 --> 01:17:42.533]  Big article on Infowars.com.
[01:17:42.934 --> 01:17:44.995]  Jamie White's working around the clock here to get this out for you.
[01:17:45.015 --> 01:17:47.997]  By the way, I want to thank this crew and the great job they've done and just separately.
[01:17:49.497 --> 01:17:51.859]  I guess I should get my folder, my red folder that has plugs in it.
[01:17:52.619 --> 01:17:56.742]  I say commercial-free, we're not running commercials, but take these blocking pockets.
[01:17:56.762 --> 01:17:57.383]  We have them in blue.
[01:17:58.323 --> 01:17:59.064]  We have them in red.
[01:17:59.684 --> 01:18:00.445]  We have them in green.
[01:18:01.025 --> 01:18:01.706]  We have them in black.
[01:18:01.766 --> 01:18:02.546]  Black sold out.
[01:18:02.726 --> 01:18:07.309]  We sold as many black ones as we sold the other colors, which I get.
[01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:08.550]  It's not really standing out.
[01:18:08.971 --> 01:18:11.192]  It's low-key, but we got more black ones in.
[01:18:11.893 --> 01:18:17.617]  These are high-quality Faraday cages that block out the contact tracers, the globalists, hackers, controllers.
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:21.702]  They're $19.95, they cost us like $11 a piece.
[01:18:21.722 --> 01:18:24.503]  Other people sell similar units, the same units, for like $35.
[01:18:24.703 --> 01:18:26.404]  And I get it, they need a markup to operate.
[01:18:26.964 --> 01:18:27.905]  We don't do it that way.
[01:18:28.005 --> 01:18:29.746]  I'm making like $9 on these or less.
[01:18:30.066 --> 01:18:31.367]  We need the money to fund ourselves.
[01:18:32.779 --> 01:18:32.959]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:52.492 --> 01:18:54.533]  Backdooring it.
[01:18:54.834 --> 01:18:59.037]  People say they put these locket pockets on them, these privacy pockets, and that you sleep better.
[01:18:59.437 --> 01:19:02.079]  That's come out because they're always sending pings to it.
[01:19:02.339 --> 01:19:05.962]  It's not just making noises, but sending out radiation.
[01:19:06.202 --> 01:19:15.288]  So it's a good thing to imprison these guys right here inside of the container.
[01:19:15.909 --> 01:19:18.150]  And then that way, it just slips right in your pocket.
[01:19:18.631 --> 01:19:20.152]  Fits really, really easy, really, really well.
[01:19:21.311 --> 01:19:21.771]  And there it is.
[01:19:21.831 --> 01:19:22.151]  Voila!
[01:19:22.631 --> 01:19:25.252]  Goes in your back pocket, front pocket, goes in your purse, whatever.
[01:19:25.692 --> 01:19:28.032]  We've got four colors at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:19:28.092 --> 01:19:30.153]  And now you're in control, they're in control.
[01:19:30.173 --> 01:19:32.293]  A major step into a wider world.
[01:19:32.713 --> 01:19:43.396]  Separately, we've got it in the Essential Special on 8-pack Power Stack, X2, X3, and a bunch of other best-selling items like the Back in Stock,
[01:19:45.615 --> 01:19:46.315]  I'm going to reset, refocus.
[01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:15.500]  After the 16 minute video.
[01:20:17.201 --> 01:20:22.665]  And we're going to come back with the next phase of the martial law lockdown with the UN running the COVID system.
[01:20:23.206 --> 01:20:29.911]  And now bringing the levels of draconian control we've seen in Australia, and the EU home to America's shores.
[01:20:30.371 --> 01:20:31.492]  That's coming up on the other side.
[01:20:31.532 --> 01:20:32.813]  So now's the time to push back.
[01:20:33.133 --> 01:20:34.254]  Now's the time to say no.
[01:20:34.554 --> 01:20:36.616]  We salute our brethren in the United Kingdom.
[01:20:37.156 --> 01:20:37.936]  We're really proud of you.
[01:20:38.137 --> 01:20:38.497]  God bless.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:05.862]  There we go!
[01:21:05.902 --> 01:21:07.623]  Thank you.
[01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:08.404]  Thank you.
[01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:10.385]  What a joy it is
[01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:53.594]  We gather here today because a dangerous disease, a deadly disease is sweeping across this land and across this world.
[01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:56.715]  And it's not COVID-19, it is fascism!
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:12.282]  Fascism justified by the illusion pandemic of COVID-19.
[01:22:16.403 --> 01:22:27.525]  A virus, I must give it credit, is so well equipped for every eventuality.
[01:22:30.273 --> 01:22:37.114]  You must not go nearer that six feet to another person to protect you from the virus.
[01:22:39.235 --> 01:22:42.276]  So now it's got a bloody tape measure!
[01:22:48.757 --> 01:22:53.598]  You must not stay with anyone outside your bubble.
[01:22:55.282 --> 01:22:57.643]  For more than 15 minutes!
[01:22:58.143 --> 01:23:00.424]  Now it's got a bloody watch!
[01:23:06.847 --> 01:23:16.210]  And we are going to make masks mandatory, but not until the end of next week!
[01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:18.991]  Now it's got a bloody calendar!
[01:23:32.705 --> 01:23:35.647]  Why is it nonsense
[01:23:54.022 --> 01:24:02.264]  Why can anyone with half a brain cell on activity C or active duty C that it's a nonsense?
[01:24:02.664 --> 01:24:10.407]  Because they are making it up!
[01:24:11.487 --> 01:24:12.227]  So why?
[01:24:13.288 --> 01:24:14.688]  Why are they doing that?
[01:24:15.248 --> 01:24:21.510]  Well, I can answer that with another point, another question.
[01:24:22.623 --> 01:24:26.448]  How could I have predicted current events decades ago?
[01:24:26.888 --> 01:24:30.412]  How could Aldous Huxley have done it in the 1930s?
[01:24:30.713 --> 01:24:34.717]  How could George Orwell have done it in the 1940s?
[01:24:35.138 --> 01:24:35.779]  Simple.
[01:24:36.359 --> 01:24:39.803]  Current events are not random.
[01:24:40.124 --> 01:24:42.527]  They have not just happened.
[01:24:47.381 --> 01:25:11.919]  We are seeing a long, long planned agenda rolling out in a script and it is destined, if we do not stand up now, to end with the total global subjugation of the human race, not least technologically.
[01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:20.592]  We now are standing at an amazing point in history, where we are at a fork in the road.
[01:25:24.313 --> 01:25:32.996]  If we go on allowing the psychopaths to dictate our lives, this is not going to end well.
[01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:46.521]  But if we remember, remember where the power is, then this can end in a dramatically short time.
[01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:48.663]  The power is with us.
[01:25:57.511 --> 01:25:59.833]  Percy Shelley understood this.
[01:26:00.862 --> 01:26:10.908]  When he wrote 200 years ago his oh so appropriately named The Mask of Anarchy.
[01:26:12.829 --> 01:26:19.453]  Rise like lions after slumber in unvanquishable number.
[01:26:20.266 --> 01:26:23.328]  Shake your chains to earth like dew.
[01:26:23.828 --> 01:26:26.650]  Witches' sleep have fallen on you.
[01:26:27.150 --> 01:26:30.172]  Ye are many, they are few.
[01:26:40.449 --> 01:26:50.158]  And those words were written in 1819 and so much of humanity still has not learned the lesson.
[01:26:51.379 --> 01:26:54.182]  This, this whole
[01:26:56.005 --> 01:27:08.476]  Subjugation and imposition of fascism on the human race worldwide is being run not by health professionals even, but by psychologists.
[01:27:08.896 --> 01:27:23.969]  Just down the road there, yards from where we are, is the British government's cabinet office-owned private company called the Behavioural Insights Team.
[01:27:24.856 --> 01:27:36.226]  And it's job is simply to study human psychology and then to play out what it's learned to re-modify the behavior of the population.
[01:27:36.466 --> 01:27:38.047]  And by the way, that's all public.
[01:27:38.087 --> 01:27:40.649]  The NIH hired Yale to do a psychological deal.
[01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:42.050]  Stop that!
[01:27:42.451 --> 01:27:43.311]  Stop that!
[01:27:46.474 --> 01:27:53.420]  What they don't want us to know, the biggest mind trick they play on us, is this.
[01:27:55.416 --> 01:28:01.578]  They want us to believe that authority has power.
[01:28:02.699 --> 01:28:06.620]  Authority has no power.
[01:28:09.481 --> 01:28:22.666]  Authority's power the world over is only our power which we give to them.
[01:28:27.364 --> 01:28:35.888]  When thousands of people headed to the beaches a few weeks ago, there was no chance of unsocial distancing.
[01:28:36.768 --> 01:28:39.569]  So they were sitting together in their thousands.
[01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:43.991]  The local authority declared a major incident.
[01:28:45.172 --> 01:28:47.153]  Okay, declare it.
[01:28:47.933 --> 01:28:49.674]  But what are you going to do about it?
[01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:54.259]  Well, there's nothing we can do, is there?
[01:28:54.319 --> 01:28:56.505]  There's too many people that won't obey.
[01:28:56.886 --> 01:28:57.608]  Exactly!
[01:29:05.171 --> 01:29:17.002]  This world is controlled by a tiny few people because of a simple sequence of imposition and acquiescence.
[01:29:17.723 --> 01:29:22.427]  All the way down the pyramid, imposition, acquiescence.
[01:29:22.507 --> 01:29:29.574]  The next level acquiesces and imposes on the next level, and then it goes down to us, the people.
[01:29:30.394 --> 01:29:38.499]  And if we acquiesce to that level of the hierarchy that seeks to impose on us, i.e.
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:48.146]  government, police, then we complete a circuit between the tiny few in the shadows and the entire global population.
[01:29:48.946 --> 01:29:56.971]  And that circuit means that a tiny few impose their agenda on billions of people.
[01:29:59.774 --> 01:30:04.196]  How do we break that sequence?
[01:30:04.776 --> 01:30:07.157]  We stop acquiescing.
[01:30:11.598 --> 01:30:12.959]  Human rights!
[01:30:13.599 --> 01:30:15.620]  Get off your knees!
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.901]  The lion sees no more!
[01:30:27.995 --> 01:30:29.096]  Stay in your homes!
[01:30:29.616 --> 01:30:30.117]  No!
[01:30:32.158 --> 01:30:33.119]  Wear a mask!
[01:30:33.619 --> 01:30:34.980]  No!
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.523]  Let your kids be psychologically dismantled!
[01:30:38.843 --> 01:30:39.123]  No!
[01:30:41.585 --> 01:30:42.465]  It is time.
[01:30:43.046 --> 01:30:48.147]  It is well past the time where we learn the lessons of history.
[01:30:48.508 --> 01:30:57.611]  The entirety of human history is one of the few controlling the many, because the many acquiesce to the few.
[01:30:58.091 --> 01:30:58.571]  Enough!
[01:31:04.313 --> 01:31:05.874]  Freedom!
[01:31:15.049 --> 01:31:15.809]  And we, we accept nothing less.
[01:31:15.829 --> 01:31:17.550]  And I say to the police officers that our police are this.
[01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:18.090]  You have children.
[01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.531]  You have my children.
[01:31:47.119 --> 01:31:55.086]  And you are enforcing the fascism which your own children and grandchildren will have to live with.
[01:31:55.266 --> 01:32:00.630]  Join us, for goodness sake, and stop serving the psychopaths.
[01:32:08.156 --> 01:32:14.742]  There are billions of us at the core of the core of these
[01:32:15.706 --> 01:32:17.249]  Psychopathic web.
[01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:20.554]  You would get them in one room.
[01:32:20.954 --> 01:32:23.498]  I think I can see a way out of this.
[01:32:26.362 --> 01:32:28.225]  Come on people of the world.
[01:32:28.806 --> 01:32:29.086]  Let's go!
[01:33:05.077 --> 01:33:09.699]  It's the tyrannical government that will overthrow the people.
[01:33:10.279 --> 01:33:12.820]  It is the people allowing it.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.780]  Are we going to allow it?
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.101]  No!
[01:33:16.161 --> 01:33:17.641]  Are we going to allow it?
[01:33:17.761 --> 01:33:18.922]  No!
[01:33:19.002 --> 01:33:22.123]  Give the cops in the helicopter our ways!
[01:33:22.243 --> 01:33:24.024]  No!
[01:33:26.544 --> 01:33:33.147]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to now try and cut to the live feed Senator Scott Jensen.
[01:33:34.409 --> 01:33:35.313]  Y'all be ready!
[01:33:37.722 --> 01:33:38.643]  We're nearly ready.
[01:33:39.043 --> 01:33:42.124]  Let's just take a minute to remember Neil Ferguson.
[01:33:42.144 --> 01:33:43.185]  Who remembers him?
[01:33:45.326 --> 01:33:51.770]  He told us that we had to go on lockdown because of his phony computer system.
[01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:53.291]  And where was he?
[01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:58.734]  He was out playing hide and salami with his married girlfriend.
[01:33:58.794 --> 01:34:01.335]  What do we say about that?
[01:34:01.695 --> 01:34:02.976]  Dirty dog!
[01:34:03.536 --> 01:34:04.837]  Dirty dog!
[01:34:05.257 --> 01:34:06.458]  Dirty dog!
[01:34:06.958 --> 01:34:08.179]  Dirty dog!
[01:34:09.639 --> 01:34:17.723]  OK, we're going to cut now to Senator Scott Jensen.
[01:34:17.803 --> 01:34:21.105]  And ladies, in the front now, scrapping.
[01:34:21.605 --> 01:34:22.286]  Stop it.
[01:34:22.406 --> 01:34:23.826]  We're all in this together.
[01:34:24.287 --> 01:34:27.288]  Let's be mates and scrap with the government.
[01:34:35.152 --> 01:34:39.019]  Have we got Scott Jensen yet?
[01:34:40.487 --> 01:34:41.488]  We're just waiting.
[01:34:41.508 --> 01:34:42.869]  So let's just fill in here.
[01:34:42.889 --> 01:34:45.331]  Remember that new vaccine.
[01:34:45.771 --> 01:34:47.753]  It's an RNA vaccine.
[01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:50.395]  It's never been done before.
[01:34:50.455 --> 01:34:52.156]  No vaccine proven safe.
[01:34:52.696 --> 01:34:54.698]  No vaccine proven effective.
[01:34:55.138 --> 01:34:57.280]  It's going to go into your DNA.
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:59.522]  It's going to keep replicating.
[01:34:59.882 --> 01:35:03.445]  It's going to remove who you are as it goes down the line.
[01:35:03.745 --> 01:35:06.147]  That's after it's sterilised you.
[01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:10.910]  I don't know who that lady is, but I'll interview her.
[01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:13.151]  She knows what she's talking about.
[01:35:13.171 --> 01:35:16.213]  This is all spiritual law.
[01:35:36.271 --> 01:35:36.911]  No masks!
[01:35:36.951 --> 01:35:37.611]  Masks off!
[01:36:04.841 --> 01:36:05.941]  I said that to Islam, too.
[01:36:06.001 --> 01:36:06.741]  Take your mask off.
[01:36:12.403 --> 01:36:13.463]  There's more to the rally.
[01:36:13.503 --> 01:36:15.544]  It's posted at Infowars.com.
[01:36:15.724 --> 01:36:17.304]  Incredible job.
[01:36:18.364 --> 01:36:21.605]  And again, that's the first big one in London, probably 40, 50,000 people.
[01:36:22.065 --> 01:36:23.286]  The next one will probably be a million.
[01:36:23.306 --> 01:36:24.346]  Same thing happened in Germany.
[01:36:24.746 --> 01:36:26.506]  Starts 30, 40,000, then a million.
[01:36:27.867 --> 01:36:28.807]  Then the police try to ban it.
[01:36:28.827 --> 01:36:29.227]  It fails.
[01:36:30.487 --> 01:36:31.868]  And the police know it's all a fraud.
[01:36:31.888 --> 01:36:33.148]  They know it's a globalist takeover.
[01:36:35.805 --> 01:36:36.065]  Okay.
[01:36:39.568 --> 01:36:42.391]  You heard David Icke there, so let me just back him up and give you the big news.
[01:36:43.172 --> 01:36:45.654]  Talk about how psychological warfare groups are doing this.
[01:36:45.694 --> 01:36:50.638]  David's a great communicator, because he'll just tell you what's going on, even though he's got documentation.
[01:36:51.019 --> 01:36:52.460]  He usually won't give the documentation.
[01:36:54.081 --> 01:36:55.363]  He knows people will just go find it.
[01:36:56.564 --> 01:36:59.426]  He does these long PowerPoints where he does show each piece.
[01:37:00.387 --> 01:37:01.969]  But I'd like to show you.
[01:37:02.029 --> 01:37:02.149]  So
[01:37:03.686 --> 01:37:10.850]  Here's federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials on how best to persuade Americans to take COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:37:11.251 --> 01:37:14.032]  This is from Yale's own website, gatewaypundit.com reported on it.
[01:37:14.933 --> 01:37:16.714]  And it just admits the whole thing's a hoax.
[01:37:19.355 --> 01:37:21.257]  Now let's move on to the big enchilada.
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:31.803]  How many times have I told you that
[01:37:33.615 --> 01:37:36.897]  They are going to follow the United Nations directives.
[01:37:37.777 --> 01:37:38.078]  A lot.
[01:37:38.978 --> 01:37:49.704]  Because it's the big corporations, the big pharma, funds the UNWHO, and as the WHO meetings in December last year admitted, they don't test, they don't know, they're told by big pharma what to say and what to do.
[01:37:50.084 --> 01:37:59.990]  They said big pharma tells us it's tested, doesn't cause problems, but we looked, it's not tested, and the vaccines are killing people, and the doctors don't believe them anymore, and the public's revolting, we have a wobbly front line, what are we going to do?
[01:38:01.431 --> 01:38:04.372]  You won't launch Operation Event 201 lockstep.
[01:38:04.772 --> 01:38:06.593]  Rockefeller Foundation with Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:38:07.353 --> 01:38:12.115]  And they admit authoritarian world government takeover with a simulant virus or a real virus.
[01:38:12.755 --> 01:38:15.476]  But you want the simulant virus to still kill some old people.
[01:38:17.694 --> 01:38:21.935]  But you want it to be engineered so you own it, so you make all the money and control it.
[01:38:22.335 --> 01:38:30.637]  But you also want it to mimic a regular flu, or regular cold, or regular bacterial infection in the testing so everyone's guilty.
[01:38:31.237 --> 01:38:41.639]  So every person dying of a gunshot wound, a car wreck, cancer, they get tested and then you get the money.
[01:38:42.955 --> 01:38:45.016]  Lebowski, $52,000 plus.
[01:38:45.256 --> 01:38:48.158]  And again, I was talking to a family friend who's a professional yesterday.
[01:38:50.319 --> 01:38:51.640]  He's a lawyer, and I'm sitting there.
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:55.162]  He goes, well, I know an 87-year-old person.
[01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:56.983]  I know somebody that did die of COVID.
[01:38:57.443 --> 01:38:59.084]  I said, what are they, 85 with cancer?
[01:38:59.784 --> 01:39:00.885]  He goes, what, I already told you?
[01:39:01.445 --> 01:39:03.426]  Yeah, he's 87 with cancer.
[01:39:07.989 --> 01:39:08.869]  You know, not just 87.
[01:39:12.193 --> 01:39:19.177]  But the hospital gets money to put on the death certificate COVID.
[01:39:19.237 --> 01:39:20.417]  I mean, so they're going to do it.
[01:39:22.118 --> 01:39:26.341]  And I've got a stack of news, mainstream news admitting it this week.
[01:39:31.143 --> 01:39:34.045]  But it's the same story over and over again.
[01:39:34.085 --> 01:39:34.805]  So what are they doing?
[01:39:34.845 --> 01:39:41.409]  They are now ratcheting testing up because the public isn't scared now and knows it's an overblown hoax.
[01:39:43.646 --> 01:39:45.187]  They're not going into getting tested now.
[01:39:47.068 --> 01:39:53.993]  And so what are they doing in New Jersey, and New York, and Michigan, and California, and Hawaii?
[01:39:54.313 --> 01:39:58.216]  Well, exactly what was being done in Australia and Spain the last few months.
[01:39:59.437 --> 01:40:06.582]  They set up highway checkpoints, and when you drive into them, they say, hey, we'll let you go on.
[01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:09.795]  But we're going to turn you back if you don't take the test.
[01:40:10.316 --> 01:40:11.697]  I've even got the local newscast.
[01:40:11.917 --> 01:40:13.378]  My God.
[01:40:14.879 --> 01:40:15.600]  Is this not evil?
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.621]  This is out of Hawaii News Now.
[01:40:19.502 --> 01:40:27.468]  State to use entire H3 highway, this particular island, that's where most traffic is, to facilitate COVID-19 testing.
[01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:36.094]  It says traffic will all be stopped in the tunnels, so you can't escape or turn around, and that you, if you want to continue on, will give them a test.
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.341]  That's called medical martial law.
[01:40:41.883 --> 01:40:44.865]  Just like six weeks ago, eight weeks ago in Australia.
[01:40:45.065 --> 01:40:45.706]  Oh, in Melbourne.
[01:40:45.866 --> 01:40:49.909]  Oh, just don't leave, you know, your apartment building.
[01:40:50.389 --> 01:40:51.731]  Oh, without a mask.
[01:40:51.991 --> 01:40:53.352]  Oh, you can't leave with a mask.
[01:40:53.832 --> 01:40:57.815]  And then women are being tackled and arrested with masks on, leaving their houses.
[01:40:58.256 --> 01:40:59.357]  You're like, why are you doing that?
[01:40:59.717 --> 01:41:00.798]  It's about power.
[01:41:02.199 --> 01:41:08.024]  It's about the UN and the globalists and leftist cities seeing, well, they can get away with it.
[01:41:09.895 --> 01:41:11.095]  You've been given notice.
[01:41:11.115 --> 01:41:12.236]  They try to legalese that.
[01:41:12.396 --> 01:41:15.577]  Oh, you've been given notice, as if the average person is going to see this newscast.
[01:41:16.057 --> 01:41:29.782]  When you go down the main highway on one of the most populous islands in Hawaii, I will say this about folks in Hawaii, you will give the sample, it says, or you'll be turned around.
[01:41:32.884 --> 01:41:34.164]  But you can't turn around on the tunnel.
[01:41:37.034 --> 01:41:38.455]  So, that's what Highlandmen do.
[01:41:38.495 --> 01:41:41.236]  They block the road and they demand their toll.
[01:41:41.276 --> 01:41:43.697]  This toll is, we're going to shove something up your nose.
[01:41:43.717 --> 01:41:52.361]  But don't worry, they said they're going to have drones on site, robots watching people, and they've got robots on order next year that will conduct the tests in Hawaii.
[01:41:52.381 --> 01:41:54.982]  They're ordering robots that shove a swab up your nose.
[01:41:55.002 --> 01:42:01.145]  So now, not as a checkpoint, a robot rolls up, this is on the news, and shoves a deal into your head.
[01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:05.651]  Because they know the humans are going to stop saying they're going to go along with it.
[01:42:05.691 --> 01:42:06.091]  Don't worry.
[01:42:06.472 --> 01:42:07.872]  The robots will shut the road.
[01:42:08.433 --> 01:42:08.773]  Everything.
[01:42:10.354 --> 01:42:13.216]  Guys, type in robot does COVID testing.
[01:42:13.256 --> 01:42:13.876]  I'm not kidding.
[01:42:13.916 --> 01:42:14.797]  You can't make this up.
[01:42:14.877 --> 01:42:16.178]  Hawaii's involved in it.
[01:42:17.759 --> 01:42:18.499]  Oh, but don't worry.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.902]  State officials say the lockdown numbers of deaths are way down.
[01:42:23.722 --> 01:42:25.463]  They're lying about hospitals being full.
[01:42:25.483 --> 01:42:26.144]  That's been proven.
[01:42:26.704 --> 01:42:30.567]  So now they're using Hawaii as a microcosm for the rest of us to beta test.
[01:42:31.567 --> 01:42:32.548]  They say, don't worry.
[01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:39.052]  It's going to explode now that we're going to force you all to be tested because the tests are fake.
[01:42:40.773 --> 01:42:47.098]  If you've had the cold, if you've had the flu, if you've had an infection, this happens.
[01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:53.262]  Number of COVID-19 cases likely to spike after testing surge.
[01:42:53.882 --> 01:42:56.084]  Officials warn Hawaii News Now.
[01:42:57.185 --> 01:43:01.809]  So we don't wanna scare you, but it's not about who's dying now, it's about the infections.
[01:43:06.313 --> 01:43:10.817]  Yeah, no, that's the robot ordering you to wear your mask.
[01:43:10.877 --> 01:43:16.642]  There's videos, they have robots they're ordering that type in robots to administer COVID-19 tests.
[01:43:16.722 --> 01:43:17.903]  I'm not lying, you can't make this up.
[01:43:20.097 --> 01:43:27.899]  Here's a London Guardian article showing a tiny part of the crowd attacking him, coronavirus skeptics, conspiracy theorists, and anti-vaxxers protesting in London.
[01:43:28.219 --> 01:43:29.079]  How dare us?
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:33.401]  Even though all the studies... Hey, will you guys dig into Friday's stack or Thursday's stack?
[01:43:33.941 --> 01:43:34.921]  I forgot to cover that.
[01:43:34.961 --> 01:43:40.523]  In Thursday's stack is a huge stack of mainstream news articles about 5G causing cancer and studies.
[01:43:41.063 --> 01:43:49.065]  And the big tweet that was one of the top tweets on Twitter, had like 20,000 retweets, said it's not just Alex Jones saying all this.
[01:43:50.569 --> 01:43:54.390]  It's the actual mainline media and the studies.
[01:43:55.831 --> 01:43:56.531]  But let's continue.
[01:43:57.792 --> 01:43:59.032]  Here's a local paper in Austin.
[01:43:59.152 --> 01:44:05.214]  Are Austin officials playing questionable numbers games to keep cities shut down?
[01:44:05.294 --> 01:44:15.578]  It goes on to say that the state and the city admit most of the tests are false positive and that they've been lying to the public about it all, but they don't care.
[01:44:15.878 --> 01:44:17.539]  They're going to keep things shut down.
[01:44:20.947 --> 01:44:28.472]  Look at this article by Kit Daniels that links to the Dallas Morning News and links to the county up there that borders Dallas.
[01:44:30.533 --> 01:44:35.776]  Texas County drops from 4,600 active COVID cases to under 100 after audit.
[01:44:38.778 --> 01:44:47.624]  Down to the accuracy of the state of Texas COVID-19 numbers, Collin County, Texas, that's Plano, dropped its active case numbers from 4,600 to 100 overnight after an audit.
[01:44:51.638 --> 01:45:05.812]  Earlier this month, Collin County's COVID-19 dashboard claimed 4,600 active cases in the county based on data provided by Texas Department of State Health Services prompting county officials to question the accuracy of the data because presumably the county's hospitals weren't overloaded.
[01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:07.934]  Though the news said they were.
[01:45:07.954 --> 01:45:09.336]  Oh, how interesting.
[01:45:10.762 --> 01:45:15.843]  Collin County is providing COVID-19 numbers and data convenience to our residents.
[01:45:15.883 --> 01:45:22.264]  However, Department of State Health and Services officials have acknowledged that the active case count for Collin County is significantly overstated.
[01:45:22.724 --> 01:45:25.205]  Read the disclaimer on the county's website.
[01:45:25.785 --> 01:45:29.806]  We advise residents that Collin County lacks confidence in the data currently being provided to us.
[01:45:32.466 --> 01:45:34.046]  81 active cases is what they found.
[01:45:34.966 --> 01:45:35.867]  The computer says 4,600.
[01:45:40.512 --> 01:45:50.434]  And it's the same story, folks, where you've got in Florida, California, hundreds of labs say 100% positives on tests.
[01:45:53.375 --> 01:45:54.375]  And it turns out it's a fraud.
[01:45:58.756 --> 01:46:02.197]  Every stinking bit of it is a fraud.
[01:46:03.177 --> 01:46:05.278]  Every damn inch of it is a fraud.
[01:46:07.677 --> 01:46:09.178]  And President Trump's dealing with a hurricane.
[01:46:09.198 --> 01:46:10.259]  You know, hurricanes are terrible.
[01:46:10.299 --> 01:46:10.920]  They kill people.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.101]  They destroy houses.
[01:46:12.161 --> 01:46:20.229]  But this mask-wearing cult of all these people wanting to follow and go along with the social contract and that if they just
[01:46:21.710 --> 01:46:24.413]  Do that, they're heroes, like all the corporate billboards say.
[01:46:24.473 --> 01:46:31.820]  No, you're agreeing to the contact tracing from the Clintons and the UN and the forced inoculations and the tracker apps on all the phones.
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:41.990]  No, the mask is the symbol, not of Sharia law, but globalist law and a religious sacrament of the left that we must repudiate and say no to.
[01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:47.953]  TownHall.com's got a big, powerful article on this.
[01:46:48.093 --> 01:46:53.198]  Once again, Newsom, the American psycho of California, changes the rules for California reporting.
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:59.183]  They say it doesn't matter if there's any deaths, the state stays shut down.
[01:47:01.606 --> 01:47:08.793]  But in select areas that they control by computer, they stay open like his vineyards and his restaurants he owns with Nancy Pelosi.
[01:47:09.373 --> 01:47:10.014]  Over 50 of them.
[01:47:13.237 --> 01:47:17.580]  Just like the Mayor Lightfoot of Chicago said, I get a haircut, I'm important, you don't.
[01:47:18.301 --> 01:47:20.282]  I have security, you're not important, I am.
[01:47:20.522 --> 01:47:21.443]  She actually said that.
[01:47:21.483 --> 01:47:22.684]  I could play you the clips, you've seen them.
[01:47:23.264 --> 01:47:24.345]  You're like, well that's discrediting!
[01:47:24.685 --> 01:47:30.089]  When they break your back when a pimp... There was that show on HBO or whatever about pimps, I forget the name of the show, but...
[01:47:31.156 --> 01:47:32.798]  The woman's had cigarettes put out on her.
[01:47:32.818 --> 01:47:33.838]  She's been totally used.
[01:47:34.219 --> 01:47:35.099]  She's hit by a car.
[01:47:35.139 --> 01:47:35.940]  She's in the hospital.
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:38.482]  And she's telling my mama, get out of here, mama.
[01:47:38.522 --> 01:47:39.002]  Screw you.
[01:47:39.022 --> 01:47:39.723]  I don't love you.
[01:47:39.763 --> 01:47:40.904]  Don't try to get me out of this.
[01:47:41.004 --> 01:47:42.545]  I want my... And the pimp comes in.
[01:47:42.565 --> 01:47:44.747]  She goes, baby, I'm sorry.
[01:47:45.667 --> 01:47:46.208]  I'm sorry.
[01:47:46.228 --> 01:47:47.989]  I'll get back on the street for you, baby.
[01:47:48.730 --> 01:47:49.750]  He's like, yeah, bitch.
[01:47:50.231 --> 01:47:51.552]  You don't get back on the street for me.
[01:47:51.672 --> 01:47:52.312]  Get back to work.
[01:47:53.853 --> 01:47:54.614]  She's like, I don't care.
[01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:56.015]  You put cigarettes out on me.
[01:47:56.075 --> 01:47:56.515]  I don't care.
[01:47:56.535 --> 01:47:56.896]  You beat me.
[01:47:58.137 --> 01:47:59.498]  And so the producers ask him, they go,
[01:48:00.899 --> 01:48:02.882]  What do you... What do you pay her?
[01:48:03.042 --> 01:48:04.363]  I don't pay that bitch nothing!
[01:48:05.124 --> 01:48:08.449]  She's lucky if I give her, once a week, a bucket of chicken!
[01:48:11.232 --> 01:48:13.595]  That's exactly what all this is, man.
[01:48:13.896 --> 01:48:14.677]  Pimping us.
[01:48:18.098 --> 01:48:19.719]  I get a haircut, you don't.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:30.847]  Silicon Valley has huge parties in LA and San Francisco and Portland and Washington, but when some startup guys have it at their mansion, they get arrested and indicted on felonies.
[01:48:31.608 --> 01:48:33.289]  You don't have a party, we have a party.
[01:48:33.849 --> 01:48:35.971]  You don't get a haircut, we get a haircut.
[01:48:36.391 --> 01:48:38.593]  You don't get security, we get security.
[01:48:38.853 --> 01:48:40.054]  It's like up in Minneapolis.
[01:48:41.895 --> 01:48:46.839]  They cut the cops by 20%, but then they hired private security for the
[01:48:48.317 --> 01:48:51.118]  Liberal members of the City Council.
[01:48:53.199 --> 01:48:54.419]  You're like, that doesn't make sense.
[01:48:54.459 --> 01:48:56.300]  Get rid of the cops, but they get private security.
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:57.960]  What do you mean it doesn't make sense?
[01:48:58.421 --> 01:49:09.985]  When a pimp's beating you with an old clothes hanger, he's breaking your will.
[01:49:11.165 --> 01:49:12.385]  He's pimping you out.
[01:49:13.006 --> 01:49:14.106]  He's bitch slapping you.
[01:49:15.694 --> 01:49:19.737]  He's teaching you that logic doesn't exist!
[01:49:23.499 --> 01:49:25.160]  Because they want to suspend logic.
[01:49:26.441 --> 01:49:29.723]  So you're soulless, and you're alone, and you don't know what to do.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.821]  I want to live on a planet like that and I don't believe that's going to win.
[01:49:34.841 --> 01:49:35.782]  I believe in you.
[01:49:36.222 --> 01:49:38.663]  And I get we've been free and we've been fat and we've been decadent.
[01:49:38.683 --> 01:49:39.403]  Hell, I am too.
[01:49:40.104 --> 01:49:42.565]  Nobody likes to eat food and have sex and whatever more than me.
[01:49:42.605 --> 01:49:43.365]  But you know what?
[01:49:43.425 --> 01:49:44.305]  I still care about freedom.
[01:49:44.345 --> 01:49:46.806]  I still get up seven days a week and want to fight.
[01:49:47.787 --> 01:49:50.788]  So stop having an instinct that not caring gets you ahead.
[01:49:51.088 --> 01:49:54.950]  That's how you become soulless and start getting involved now.
[01:49:57.961 --> 01:50:02.003]  Can you imagine the main highway in the main, most populous island of Hawaii?
[01:50:05.544 --> 01:50:06.705]  Six months of martial law.
[01:50:07.685 --> 01:50:11.147]  And you pull up and they're doing forced testing on you.
[01:50:11.307 --> 01:50:14.709]  And then Newsom's caught with all these new fake rules he's got.
[01:50:14.749 --> 01:50:15.409]  Look at the shot.
[01:50:16.169 --> 01:50:17.290]  An old lady in a wheelchair.
[01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:19.111]  You're not allowed to sit at the beach in Hawaii.
[01:50:20.972 --> 01:50:22.392]  Because that's just an arbitrary rule.
[01:50:22.732 --> 01:50:23.993]  There they are giving an old lady a ticket.
[01:50:26.107 --> 01:50:27.148]  Jason Jones sent me that.
[01:50:27.208 --> 01:50:28.649]  That's when he finally moved, he saw that.
[01:50:31.411 --> 01:50:34.293]  Oh, Black Lives Matter and Antifa can burn everything down, but you can't.
[01:50:35.074 --> 01:50:35.614]  Go to the beach.
[01:50:36.215 --> 01:50:44.662]  Oh, an AI startup is tracking the coronavirus disinformation deluge and reporting it to Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple to ban you.
[01:50:44.962 --> 01:50:46.403]  But what do they call disinfo?
[01:50:46.783 --> 01:50:53.548]  If you don't say it's a pandemic, if you don't say it's killing 4% of the public, if you don't say 2.5 million are dead in the U.S.,
[01:50:54.611 --> 01:50:56.552]  If you don't agree to the lies, they ban you!
[01:50:57.972 --> 01:51:04.634]  TikTok stars Blake Gray and Bryce Hall charged for hosting parties during COVID-19 pandemic in L.A.
[01:51:04.674 --> 01:51:18.197]  All right, let's move on here in the live transmission to the final information I'm going to cover until I'm back live, Lord willing, tomorrow, 4 p.m.
[01:51:18.237 --> 01:51:21.418]  Central and the new Ellen Schreuer Show, Sunday live.
[01:51:23.528 --> 01:51:24.308]  6 to 8 p.m.
[01:51:24.368 --> 01:51:25.328]  right after I go off.
[01:51:25.829 --> 01:51:27.149]  And you're like, wow, yeah.
[01:51:27.529 --> 01:51:28.589]  I've tried to hire more crew.
[01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:29.609]  We've got a great crew.
[01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:31.050]  There's some attrition.
[01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:33.790]  This crew's working seven days a week through the election.
[01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:35.351]  I want to thank them.
[01:51:35.371 --> 01:51:37.391]  I want to thank you for your support, folks.
[01:51:37.451 --> 01:51:40.632]  I want to tell you, we're not doing this to pretend.
[01:51:43.312 --> 01:51:44.052]  We're not LARPing.
[01:51:44.833 --> 01:51:46.473]  This isn't live action role play.
[01:51:46.693 --> 01:51:48.013]  We're not playing a video game.
[01:51:48.053 --> 01:51:50.934]  This is third dimension, real war, real freedom.
[01:51:51.014 --> 01:51:51.534]  We're doing it.
[01:51:52.509 --> 01:51:54.610]  And let me tell you, I'm happier than a pig, and you know what?
[01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:56.352]  It's not work to fight tyranny.
[01:51:56.572 --> 01:51:57.792]  It's not work to research.
[01:51:58.013 --> 01:51:59.093]  It's not work to care.
[01:51:59.173 --> 01:51:59.774]  It's living!
[01:52:02.153 --> 01:52:05.194]  I'm so much happier than I was when I was 15 years old or 20 years old.
[01:52:05.214 --> 01:52:05.874]  I was happy then.
[01:52:06.174 --> 01:52:07.535]  I'm so alive right now.
[01:52:07.835 --> 01:52:08.495]  My God.
[01:52:08.795 --> 01:52:11.896]  People think being engaged and informed is a bad thing.
[01:52:12.316 --> 01:52:13.517]  It is amazing.
[01:52:13.537 --> 01:52:15.798]  And I thank you all for keeping me in the fight.
[01:52:16.058 --> 01:52:17.298]  And so I thank you once.
[01:52:17.698 --> 01:52:20.179]  I thank you twice, three times, four times, five times.
[01:52:20.199 --> 01:52:20.699]  Thank you.
[01:52:20.879 --> 01:52:21.319]  Thank you.
[01:52:21.399 --> 01:52:21.839]  Thank you.
[01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:22.340]  Thank you.
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:22.840]  Thank you.
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:23.240]  Thank you.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:27.201]  It's why it's obscene when you call me up and say, Oh, Alex Jones, we love you.
[01:52:27.261 --> 01:52:27.661]  Thank you.
[01:52:27.942 --> 01:52:29.142]  Thank you for what I'm doing.
[01:52:30.916 --> 01:52:36.558]  Thank you for wanting air and wanting to be free and not wanting to be a slave and having your head screwed on straight.
[01:52:38.119 --> 01:52:44.981]  Don't thank me for doing something that is default, prime position, identity who I am.
[01:52:46.182 --> 01:52:51.564]  We have to stop thinking those of us that love freedom are the weirdos and we've got to start getting aggressive with everybody.
[01:52:52.704 --> 01:52:54.245]  I'm going to go out to a restaurant to stop my wife.
[01:52:57.930 --> 01:52:59.171]  When they say, why aren't you wearing your mask?
[01:52:59.231 --> 01:53:04.175]  I'll say, oh, you want me to your kabuki theater that you stay open, but I don't wear the mask.
[01:53:04.195 --> 01:53:07.237]  So I go to the table and then we all feel free to get your manager.
[01:53:07.657 --> 01:53:08.818]  And I'm going to have a talk with your manager.
[01:53:09.099 --> 01:53:11.460]  And it's not because I don't know your slaves.
[01:53:11.781 --> 01:53:13.362]  It's because I don't want you to be slaves anymore.
[01:53:13.662 --> 01:53:17.125]  And I'm going to make you expend energy without submitting to you.
[01:53:17.845 --> 01:53:20.047]  By the time we're at the table, you'll understand to be shaking my hand.
[01:53:21.687 --> 01:53:23.687]  It's not energy to give off energy.
[01:53:23.707 --> 01:53:25.088]  It's not energy to lift weights.
[01:53:25.228 --> 01:53:25.888]  I get stronger.
[01:53:25.948 --> 01:53:27.748]  It's not energy taking a mild swim.
[01:53:27.768 --> 01:53:28.469]  I get stronger.
[01:53:28.789 --> 01:53:29.109]  It's not.
[01:53:29.349 --> 01:53:33.870]  I gave up something this morning when I swam for a mile, try to get back in shape and working too much.
[01:53:34.930 --> 01:53:36.670]  It's I got stronger in the process.
[01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:37.471]  I didn't get weaker.
[01:53:38.431 --> 01:53:45.893]  So stop conforming to whatever program comes down from Bill Gates and the UN start telling the truth yourself and saying no to their system.
[01:53:46.613 --> 01:53:47.553]  And that's when the world changes.
[01:53:49.482 --> 01:53:52.604]  Now let's play this Rand Paul clip, because this says it all.
[01:53:53.024 --> 01:53:58.167]  He's on TV last night, and he's saying, I got assaulted, they wanted to kill me.
[01:53:58.947 --> 01:54:02.349]  Obviously, these are groups paid to be at the White House, paid to do all this.
[01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:04.690]  He's been shot at with Scalise, who got shot.
[01:54:06.111 --> 01:54:09.032]  He's had six ribs broken, his lungs, you know, punctured.
[01:54:09.332 --> 01:54:10.953]  I've had one rib broken twice.
[01:54:10.973 --> 01:54:13.895]  I mean, you're talking six weeks every time you breathe, it hurts.
[01:54:13.915 --> 01:54:17.777]  I mean, that is some painful, six ribs broken.
[01:54:19.690 --> 01:54:20.951]  Punctured lung!
[01:54:22.251 --> 01:54:22.772]  Shot at!
[01:54:23.792 --> 01:54:25.773]  And he said, they're trying to, they were saying, we're going to kill you.
[01:54:26.073 --> 01:54:28.395]  He's the guy who introduced the bill for the dead black girl.
[01:54:28.435 --> 01:54:29.055]  Got it passed.
[01:54:30.856 --> 01:54:35.158]  They don't care because they're funded by Soros, who thinks people don't know what's going on.
[01:54:35.398 --> 01:54:36.239]  He's a liberal.
[01:54:36.659 --> 01:54:37.620]  An old-fashioned liberal.
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:38.400]  Not a libertarian.
[01:54:39.281 --> 01:54:40.221]  Not a leftist.
[01:54:40.361 --> 01:54:42.002]  More of a mainline conservative liberal.
[01:54:42.342 --> 01:54:43.343]  Like, believes in freedom.
[01:54:44.292 --> 01:54:46.533]  But he says, I know this is organized crime.
[01:54:46.973 --> 01:54:47.953]  We need the documents.
[01:54:47.973 --> 01:54:48.673]  Will Rand Paul?
[01:54:48.713 --> 01:54:49.634]  We've got the documents.
[01:54:50.054 --> 01:54:51.274]  They're on Infowars.com.
[01:54:51.314 --> 01:54:52.594]  Everybody sends them to Rand Paul.
[01:54:52.955 --> 01:54:55.295]  I've been pushing this three years knowing it's going to hit pay dirt.
[01:54:55.695 --> 01:54:57.476]  And pay dirt is them going to prison.
[01:54:57.936 --> 01:55:01.017]  Alexander Soros running the whole show.
[01:55:02.523 --> 01:55:04.984]  Documents still planned for civil unrest martial law.
[01:55:05.564 --> 01:55:07.025]  It's posted at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:07.065 --> 01:55:08.385]  It's posted on my feed article.
[01:55:08.966 --> 01:55:10.566]  But here's Rand Paul asking for the documents.
[01:55:10.586 --> 01:55:11.487]  Well, don't worry, sir.
[01:55:11.807 --> 01:55:12.727]  We've got the documents.
[01:55:12.747 --> 01:55:13.187]  Here it is.
[01:55:13.688 --> 01:55:15.708]  But this also isn't normal.
[01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:17.469]  There's something going on here.
[01:55:17.509 --> 01:55:20.050]  This is like the FBI needs to be involved.
[01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:22.671]  What do you mean something's going on?
[01:55:22.771 --> 01:55:24.752]  Senator, what do you mean something's going on?
[01:55:25.032 --> 01:55:25.772]  You've got a feeling.
[01:55:25.812 --> 01:55:26.513]  Tell us what you think.
[01:55:27.481 --> 01:55:35.207]  My feeling is that there is interstate criminal traffic being paid for across state lines, but you won't know unless you arrest them.
[01:55:35.567 --> 01:55:39.490]  Otherwise, you just think, oh, these are the, you know, some normal hoodlums from a big city.
[01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:45.754]  I promise you that at least some of the members and the people who attacked us were not from D.C.
[01:55:46.054 --> 01:55:51.218]  They flew here in a plane, they've all got fresh new clothes, and they were paid to be here.
[01:55:51.638 --> 01:55:54.180]  It is a crime to do that, and it needs to be traced.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.862]  The FBI needs to investigate, but the only way you can do it
[01:55:57.222 --> 01:56:01.865]  Is you have to arrest people, and usually we say, oh well, you didn't get hurt so we're not going to arrest them.
[01:56:02.205 --> 01:56:05.527]  They were inciting a riot and they would have killed us had the police not been there.
[01:56:05.807 --> 01:56:22.496]  They all need to be arrested, and I'm not saying forever, but they need to be arrested, questioned, they need to say where are you staying, and the bills need to be subpoenaed by a judge to say who paid for your bill, how did you get here on a plane, and staying in a fancy hotel, and yet you're acting like a criminal.
[01:56:22.976 --> 01:56:29.637]  Something's going on here and it's much bigger than people think, but the bottom line is we can't let the United States become Portland.
[01:56:30.058 --> 01:56:34.098]  And that's what my fear is, that the United States is going to be on fire if we have no police.
[01:56:34.639 --> 01:56:36.299]  And look, I've been for reform.
[01:56:36.599 --> 01:56:39.180]  I've authored 22 criminal justice reforms.
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:45.021]  They were yelling at me, we're not going to let you go alive unless you'll say out loud you're for criminal justice reform.
[01:56:45.321 --> 01:56:45.681]  And I'm like,
[01:56:46.141 --> 01:56:46.882]  You idiot!
[01:56:47.242 --> 01:56:52.447]  You are so dense that you have no idea that I've been a leading advocate for criminal justice reform.
[01:56:53.127 --> 01:56:54.168]  With President Obama.
[01:56:54.228 --> 01:56:55.089]  With President Trump.
[01:56:55.349 --> 01:56:56.671]  And you're gonna try to kill me?
[01:56:57.011 --> 01:56:59.233]  And I've been trying to help the problems?
[01:56:59.793 --> 01:57:02.896]  And so, this is what's sad, but it's such lawlessness.
[01:57:02.976 --> 01:57:06.660]  If we have this kind of lawlessness, I would say people are gonna get killed.
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:08.081]  People have been killed.
[01:57:09.762 --> 01:57:10.783]  And they tried to kill you.
[01:57:10.803 --> 01:57:11.524]  Alright.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:13.160]  We're out of time.
[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:15.081]  I appreciate the crew coming in on Saturday.
[01:57:15.601 --> 01:57:16.582]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:57:16.742 --> 01:57:18.263]  Lord willing, I'll be back 4 p.m.
[01:57:18.283 --> 01:57:24.726]  tomorrow, loaded for bear, and we got Owen Troyer and Sunday Live that comes on after the Sunday Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:26.468 --> 01:57:27.149]  6 to 8 p.m.
[01:57:27.549 --> 01:57:30.231]  And like I said, when I say commercial-free, we're not running network ads.
[01:57:30.692 --> 01:57:34.956]  You have four minutes at the bottom of the hour, two minutes at the start of the hour for stations out there.
[01:57:34.976 --> 01:57:36.777]  A lot of folks are going to pick the show up.
[01:57:37.037 --> 01:57:37.878]  Some are already doing it.
[01:57:38.319 --> 01:57:43.223]  We just launched the shows right now, but we're at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Band.Video.
[01:57:43.683 --> 01:57:46.486]  And we have some new URLs as well, because Band.Video is being blocked.
[01:57:47.728 --> 01:57:51.991]  By Twitter, the entire Bandop video with its own URL for all the videos you want to send out.
[01:57:52.431 --> 01:57:58.575]  Go to censoredbyjack.com and share that URL if you want to resist, if you want to win, if you want to battle the globalists.
[01:57:58.895 --> 01:57:59.496]  And you've done it!
[01:57:59.956 --> 01:58:03.858]  But now's the time for maximum effort, maximum resistance.
[01:58:04.279 --> 01:58:09.722]  Censoredbyjack.com or 2020electioncenter.com as well.
[01:58:09.742 --> 01:58:10.623]  Let me double check that.
[01:58:10.643 --> 01:58:16.807]  I've got it on my phone right here because that's the new URL I really want to push that's not even making it political so that it'll actually
[01:58:19.517 --> 01:58:20.338]  Got the Zimmerman here.
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:24.041]  Pull these up for people.
[01:58:25.162 --> 01:58:32.129]  Yep, it is 2020ElectionCenter.com.
[01:58:32.249 --> 01:58:33.310]  2020ElectionCenter.com.
[01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:35.572]  Let me show that URL to folks.
[01:58:35.732 --> 01:58:37.053]  2020ElectionCenter.com.
[01:58:37.453 --> 01:58:39.976]  That is a scraper site for all of Bandon video.
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.561]  And so that's not being censored.
[01:58:42.581 --> 01:58:43.382]  It's not being blocked.
[01:58:43.422 --> 01:58:44.242]  It looks innocuous.
[01:58:44.562 --> 01:58:48.025]  Just say, wow, amazing events breaking at 2020electioncenter.com.
[01:58:48.285 --> 01:58:50.166]  And you go there and pick whatever URL you want.
[01:58:50.927 --> 01:58:55.310]  Grab that link and send that baby out.
[01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:56.451]  2020electioncenter.com.
[01:58:59.053 --> 01:59:00.214]  I'll end it like I started it.
[01:59:00.514 --> 01:59:02.876]  The military came out, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.
[01:59:03.993 --> 01:59:06.774]  Millie and said, we've been asked to carry out a coup against Trump.
[01:59:06.794 --> 01:59:07.555]  We're not gonna be part of it.
[01:59:08.135 --> 01:59:09.175]  They could have done that privately.
[01:59:09.195 --> 01:59:11.597]  The fact that it publicly means that they understand what's happening.
[01:59:12.057 --> 01:59:13.658]  This is a shy combat operation.
[01:59:13.958 --> 01:59:14.738]  They think we're weak.
[01:59:14.838 --> 01:59:15.258]  We're not.
[01:59:15.318 --> 01:59:16.019]  We're waking up.
[01:59:16.399 --> 01:59:17.179]  They're scared now.
[01:59:17.219 --> 01:59:18.400]  That makes it even more dangerous.
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:20.681]  But as soon as this show archives.
[01:59:23.197 --> 01:59:26.802]  On this Saturday afternoon, it'll be the Band-Op video at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:27.222 --> 01:59:30.907]  It'll be out of the article about military exposes coup plot against Trump.
[01:59:31.348 --> 01:59:32.329]  Share it now.
[01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:34.331]  Breaking news alert.
[01:59:34.371 --> 01:59:36.134]  Pentagon exposes dim plot against Trump.
[01:59:36.774 --> 01:59:38.597]  Very quickly, as soon as this live show ends.
[01:59:40.570 --> 01:59:41.610]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:16.084 --> 02:00:18.105]  InfoWars has been banned.
[02:00:20.446 --> 02:00:21.027]  Arrested.
[02:00:24.369 --> 02:00:25.909]  Attacked and threatened.
[02:00:27.110 --> 02:00:28.551]  Because we are effective.
[02:00:28.591 --> 02:00:31.893]  The Great Awakening is here.
[02:00:32.253 --> 02:00:33.974]  Go to Banned.Video.
[02:00:34.554 --> 02:00:36.735]  Download the videos and share.
[02:00:38.656 --> 02:00:42.358]  Support the Information War at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:00:45.965 --> 02:00:47.786]  And never give up the fight!
