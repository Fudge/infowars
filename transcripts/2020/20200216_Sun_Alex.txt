[00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:14.984]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:21.051]  Mother, tell your children not to walk my way.
[00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:26.138]  Tell your children not to hear my words, what they mean, what they say.
[00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:26.538]  Mother,
[00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:32.287]  It is Sunday, February 16th.
[00:00:32.287 --> 00:00:33.048]  The year is 2020.
[00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:36.370]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:46.999]  We're gonna be here live for the next two hours, as we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:59.224 --> 00:01:12.387]  Now, we are going to have Max Keiser in studio with us, coming up in about 10 minutes to talk about the waterfront and make some major Bitcoin announcements as well.
[00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:20.229]  But he's always on fire, especially when he comes through maybe once a year and is in studio with us, so they're always interesting and informative.
[00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:22.250]  Max Keiser will be in studio.
[00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.154]  Mike Adams is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour with just horrifying new coronavirus developments.
[00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:34.057]  We know the virus is killing people, killing them in Europe, starting to kill people in Western nations.
[00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:40.561]  We know it's spreading very, very fast, and it's mutating into something even more deadly, it's now being confirmed.
[00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:48.366]  But the response, the response to it is what's really horrifying and really frightening, and the Communist Chinese are definitely using it.
[00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:55.820]  To suppress and demoralize their population and to try to have a crackdown in Taiwan, which have been politically...
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.964]  Slipping away under their tyranny and all of it's being cast with the dictator for life, G.G.
[00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:06.745]  Ping, as the savior.
[00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:08.486]  So that is coming up.
[00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:09.747]  Also, we had Steve Pchenik on.
[00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:12.648]  I think he's a smart guy, but I don't always agree with him completely.
[00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:20.052]  He thinks Barr is after the president, but we've got a thousand plus former Justice Department operatives saying that they want
[00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:20.912]  Yeah, I think.
[00:02:38.342 --> 00:02:41.746]  We've even talked about this, and I totally believe Drudge has sources.
[00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:42.888]  In fact, I know he does.
[00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:46.953]  And Drudge doesn't put out disinfo, and he rarely breaks a big story.
[00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:49.256]  It's almost always been dead on.
[00:02:49.256 --> 00:02:54.984]  I remember speculation that Hillary would join Bloomberg months ago when he first got in.
[00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:56.406]  Or that she'd have a broker convention.
[00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:07.448]  Or if they could have impeached Trump, then Pelosi would have been the third in line if they got rid of Pence as well, and that she would then be appointed VP by Pelosi.
[00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:10.890]  They even came out and then floated that!
[00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.935]  A hundred percent, that's what Bloomberg's doing is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to shoehorn in Hillary.
[00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:28.552]  As his VP, and then at some point he steps down, she becomes the nominee, and massive election fraud is engaged in, and she is installed.
[00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:32.894]  Because there is a cult around this woman.
[00:03:32.894 --> 00:03:45.303]  And they've always meant to put her in power, and the deep state minions that have been promised all these goodies if she ever just gets in there, they are still beavering away, believing in the coming of their messiah.
[00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:51.600]  And believing that it is her right to rule and that she is the Madam President.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.004]  That they can jerk victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:07.052]  The big question is, what type of death wish does Michael Bloomberg have to ever have her as his VP just a few heartbeats away from the presidency?
[00:04:07.052 --> 00:04:09.414]  She would absolutely end up killing him.
[00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:14.398]  But he knows that.
[00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:14.979]  They know that.
[00:04:16.772 --> 00:04:20.976]  And so that's why he would only get into office and then step down, making her the president.
[00:04:20.976 --> 00:04:23.298]  This is what they have always believed in.
[00:04:23.298 --> 00:04:30.565]  So, Bloomberg does not need to jump off of a cliff, he does not need to run headlong towards the Grim Reaper, because that's not his intention.
[00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:38.693]  He's there to soften up Trump with a bunch of propaganda, spend a bunch of money to weaken the other candidates, and then at the key moment, he steps back.
[00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:41.801]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:45.325]  We've got some really important news on the other side.
[00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:47.909]  Trump at the Daytona 500.
[00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.034]  Yes, it's actually important, and I'll explain why in my view.
[00:04:52.034 --> 00:04:52.695]  It's Sunday.
[00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:56.380]  We're live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:01.035]  Well, it's finally happening.
[00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:07.301]  The President is coming out and saying that Deep State are a bunch of out-of-control criminals that need to be prosecuted.
[00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:17.389]  And he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the State Department and the Justice Department in just the last few days.
[00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.373]  And he took the head prosecutor over stone and offered her a job at Treasury.
[00:05:22.373 --> 00:05:26.216]  As soon as she quit that job, he then withdrew the nomination.
[00:05:26.216 --> 00:05:28.278]  And now she's out on her globalist ass.
[00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:30.199]  This is beautiful.
[00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.741]  It's happening, but we need to see a lot more.
[00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:34.962]  All the neocons need to be fired.
[00:05:34.962 --> 00:05:37.364]  All the Obama appointees, fired.
[00:05:37.364 --> 00:05:41.567]  All the deep state globalists who have resumes with George Soros, fired!
[00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:42.127]  Fired!
[00:05:42.127 --> 00:05:42.687]  Fired!
[00:05:42.687 --> 00:05:43.308]  Fired!
[00:05:43.308 --> 00:05:45.329]  Trump is finally unleashed.
[00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:47.691]  Trump is not the red wave.
[00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:49.432]  He is the red storm.
[00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:58.438]  And InfoWars is the tip of the spear, powered by we the people, never backing down, never giving in, and delivering victory in our time.
[00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.080]  We've got it.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.905]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:09.167]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:11.289]  Alright, here I go.
[00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.973]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:24.878 --> 00:06:31.624]  There are 160 plus major nations on the face of this earth.
[00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:39.871]  And many of those countries are larger geographically and have more resources than the United States.
[00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:43.774]  And their populations are much greater than the United States.
[00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:47.538]  By 1955, the United States was 4% of the world's population.
[00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:50.485]  96% lived outside the United States.
[00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:56.369]  The United States had more than half the wealth on Earth.
[00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:58.010]  And the wealth wasn't stolen.
[00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.373]  The wealth was generated.
[00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:08.898]  Something that people that want communism and socialism and who haven't studied history don't understand.
[00:07:08.898 --> 00:07:12.880]  Because America was a free market capitalist nation.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.704]  It was the destination for anyone who wanted to be set free and be successful.
[00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:27.807]  And as we've become incredibly powerful, we've become decadent, our children have become decadent, we've become decadent, their children have become decadent, and we're forgetting and losing who we are.
[00:07:27.807 --> 00:07:37.090]  The point of major polls show more than half of college students identify as communist or socialist, and Bernie Sanders is the main candidate in all polls.
[00:07:38.507 --> 00:07:49.712]  Across the United States, and a billionaire oligarch who made almost all his money on fiat digital fraud, not real products, Bloomberg is coming in to the rescue.
[00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:54.034]  I don't know which one of these people is worse.
[00:07:54.034 --> 00:07:56.275]  Probably Bloomberg.
[00:07:56.275 --> 00:08:00.276]  Because he's so inauthentic and such a fraud.
[00:08:00.276 --> 00:08:03.878]  Now, contrast that
[00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:15.918]  With Hollywood and the mainstream media constantly telling you how much America sucks, and telling you how much you suck, and saying America was never great, it will never be great.
[00:08:15.918 --> 00:08:28.587]  They're doing that because they're globalists that are conquering the nation, and vertically integrating the economy, showing it up, getting rid of the middle class, putting us in debt as they devalue the currencies.
[00:08:28.587 --> 00:08:31.710]  While the very ultra-rich that claim they oppose Bernie,
[00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:45.615]  Through their endowments, teaching the colleges classic communism as, again, a way to knock out their competition and sabotage the minds of young people everywhere with the disease of collectivism.
[00:08:45.615 --> 00:08:55.059]  Now, inner Trump, he's been called a carnival barker by Hillary and by Bloomberg, who now we're hearing are going to be running mates, probably.
[00:08:58.513 --> 00:09:05.038]  Trump flies in, we'll play this in a moment, to the Daytona 500 today with a huge Flight of the Valkyries spectacle.
[00:09:05.038 --> 00:09:13.085]  Then he says, start your engines and F-16 jets fly over.
[00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.946]  It's pageantry.
[00:09:14.946 --> 00:09:15.747]  It's booing.
[00:09:15.747 --> 00:09:19.090]  It's a pep rally for the nation.
[00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:25.015]  Celebrating the great outdoors and powerful engines and men and women risking their lives
[00:09:26.055 --> 00:09:29.516]  Like modern gladiators racing around that track.
[00:09:29.516 --> 00:09:34.178]  It's the opposite of the nanny state.
[00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:37.119]  Michael Bloomberg is embracing all of his weaknesses.
[00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:38.720]  He's known as the nanny state.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.381]  He wants to tell you how much soda you can drink.
[00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:42.021]  He wants to tell you how much salt you can have.
[00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:47.524]  He says he knows best in a big article called The Technocrat.
[00:09:47.524 --> 00:09:48.704]  It talks about Bloomberg.
[00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:52.846]  He says, I do know more than everyone, I will run your life.
[00:09:54.062 --> 00:10:04.630]  And now he's in a play, I'm not kidding, this is coming up in a few minutes, as Mary Poppins, and he says, I'm gonna make Americans behave.
[00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.792]  I'm gonna become their president.
[00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:11.915]  And he rubs it in as he flies around like Mary Poppins.
[00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:17.520]  Folks, this is not satire, I'm not joking.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.782]  Absolute, total fraud.
[00:10:22.543 --> 00:10:24.386]  He wants to demoralize you.
[00:10:24.386 --> 00:10:26.709]  Trump wants to empower you.
[00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:34.820]  Because when you believe you can be empowered, and when you have the capability to be empowered, you will become empowered.
[00:10:36.817 --> 00:10:38.717]  Yeah, the article's called The Great Technocrat.
[00:10:38.717 --> 00:10:39.777]  You've got to go read it.
[00:10:39.777 --> 00:10:42.498]  And it's an interview with him, and you think it's satire.
[00:10:42.498 --> 00:10:47.139]  He's like, I'm the smartest person probably on Earth, and I know how to run your life.
[00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:54.000]  And so we're going to set up a worldwide computer system, and we will decide when you go to bed, when you wake up, what you eat, what you do.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.040]  You're like, is this a joke?
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.420]  And he's like, no.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:04.102]  And the article fawns after him, and it's $78 billion that's all just digital made-up manipulation and trading.
[00:11:04.102 --> 00:11:04.882]  All fraud.
[00:11:04.882 --> 00:11:06.142]  He produces nothing.
[00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:13.968]  He makes Bernie Madoff look like salt of the earth.
[00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:25.893]  And Hillary's behind him, and he's a shoehorn to pump money in to try to hurt the other candidates, to hurt Trump, to annihilate Sanders, and then he steps back at the last moment at Broker Convention and enslives Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:11:25.893 --> 00:11:27.233]  I told you that months ago.
[00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:29.234]  Now judges confirm that with his high-level sources.
[00:11:31.437 --> 00:11:32.458]  And Bloomberg confirmed it.
[00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:37.060]  He goes, well, we have been looking at Hillary, but you know, maybe, maybe not.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.900]  Folks don't like it.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.801]  See, they're already trial ballooning it.
[00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:41.822]  She's been on TV more than any other candidate.
[00:11:41.822 --> 00:11:48.505]  She's raising money.
[00:11:48.505 --> 00:11:53.428]  So here is the video of Trump coming in, trying to boost our morale.
[00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:57.569]  So that we're not demoralized, and so we have some fun.
[00:11:57.569 --> 00:12:01.412]  And that's so important when people are trying to tell you, you suck.
[00:12:01.412 --> 00:12:02.553]  No, we don't suck.
[00:12:02.553 --> 00:12:04.274]  America is amazing.
[00:12:04.274 --> 00:12:07.777]  And it was leading the world, and we're going to lead the world again with ideas.
[00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:09.578]  Not with socialism we export.
[00:12:09.578 --> 00:12:11.240]  Here's the president.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.204]  As we welcome you to NASCAR on Fox and the 60-second running.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:29.704]  I have been to a lot of Daytona 500s, Chris.
[00:12:29.704 --> 00:12:32.345]  Never have I felt the excitement and energy.
[00:12:32.345 --> 00:12:37.107]  We've had great races on the track, but we've got the president landing right now.
[00:12:37.107 --> 00:12:39.547]  The fans are pumped up.
[00:12:39.547 --> 00:12:40.908]  I mean, wow!
[00:12:40.908 --> 00:12:41.348]  What a day!
[00:12:41.348 --> 00:12:44.869]  And again, folks, Obama wouldn't do anything like this.
[00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:46.790]  He wants Hollywood to give him awards.
[00:12:48.464 --> 00:12:49.724]  They don't like flyover country.
[00:12:49.724 --> 00:12:55.326]  Remember he got secretly recorded saying he hates the Midwest, hates bobble thumpers, hates gun owners, bitter clingers.
[00:12:55.326 --> 00:12:56.286]  They're elitist.
[00:12:56.286 --> 00:13:00.487]  They don't want to fly over a bunch of NASCAR fans and have energy together.
[00:13:00.487 --> 00:13:03.147]  They don't want to have that communal event.
[00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:03.948]  No.
[00:13:03.948 --> 00:13:04.988]  Because they're separate from us.
[00:13:04.988 --> 00:13:06.008]  They're better than us.
[00:13:06.008 --> 00:13:17.211]  You know, I like Joe Rogan, but I saw a clip the other day where he had a reporter on and they were making fun of Midwesterners talking about the fact that
[00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:24.710]  The pimp madam that helped Epstein kidnap kids was supposedly somewhere in the Midwest.
[00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.031]  They made the jokes, oh those Midwesterners, they can't even read a book.
[00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:37.074]  They don't even know what Maxwell looks like.
[00:13:37.074 --> 00:13:38.534]  Epstein's operative.
[00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:42.035]  And again, that's that attitude of how do you get so disconnected?
[00:13:42.035 --> 00:13:42.395]  You think
[00:13:43.146 --> 00:13:46.507]  The majority of the country are idiots because of where they live.
[00:13:46.507 --> 00:13:52.950]  That's not reality-based, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.951]  That's elitism.
[00:13:54.951 --> 00:13:57.372]  And it's just, it's what the left does.
[00:13:57.372 --> 00:13:58.533]  It's their currency.
[00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:00.874]  It's the supposed power they have.
[00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:10.698]  Until the point they get so disconnected from reality that Bloomberg has hired people
[00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:16.452]  To put out memes and to have him do things he believes will make him popular.
[00:14:16.452 --> 00:14:25.137]  Here is the latest production of Michael Bloomberg.
[00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:27.678]  I'll tell you where I'm going.
[00:14:27.678 --> 00:14:35.022]  First Iowa, then New Hampshire.
[00:14:35.022 --> 00:14:38.264]  Maybe I can get the whole country to behave.
[00:14:43.996 --> 00:14:45.537]  By the way, we cut the clip short.
[00:14:45.537 --> 00:14:49.820]  They worship him for like a minute and go, Oh, we love you!
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.982]  These women.
[00:14:51.982 --> 00:14:54.644]  And he has no idea how idiotic he is.
[00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:56.805]  No idea that people hate his guts.
[00:14:56.805 --> 00:15:02.690]  No idea how ridiculous that is to then say, I'm going to make the whole country behave.
[00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.852]  I'm Mary Poppins, America's nanny.
[00:15:07.985 --> 00:15:09.766]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:09.766 --> 00:15:12.829]  So, let's go out to break with Trump and start your engines.
[00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.550]  Would you rather, AMERICA!
[00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.232]  START YOUR ENGINES!
[00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:19.453]  Or, I'm a little twerp.
[00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:20.394]  I'm your nanny.
[00:15:20.394 --> 00:15:21.394]  Here's the president.
[00:15:21.394 --> 00:15:24.176]  Words and Motorsports at the Daytona 500.
[00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:30.341]  Please welcome this year's Grand Marshal, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[00:15:30.341 --> 00:15:33.443]  Accompanied by First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump.
[00:15:39.181 --> 00:15:49.148]  Daytona International Speedway, we love our country and it's truly an honor to be with all of you at the Great American Race.
[00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:52.310]  Gentlemen, start your engines!
[00:16:00.123 --> 00:16:01.564]  Alright folks, here's the bad news.
[00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:10.210]  We've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented nanotech silver that's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else.
[00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.333]  But, we do still have it in the 3 ounce and the 1 ounce for a limited time.
[00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:16.234]  The good news is we have
[00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:22.897]  The super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste both that have the nano silver in them as well.
[00:16:22.897 --> 00:16:28.680]  The super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality iodine.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:39.265]  And then of course the whitening has the nano silver but on top of that it has the above sea coral calcium that remineralizes the teeth and so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find period.
[00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:42.687]  It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it though it'll sell out.
[00:16:42.987 --> 00:16:43.528]  InfowarsStore.com
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:08.526]  Three weeks ago, we told you the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers for the coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told.
[00:17:08.526 --> 00:17:10.508]  Now we know that that is the case.
[00:17:10.508 --> 00:17:16.732]  And we know the federal government and major corporations have been buying up all the major storable food supplies around the country.
[00:17:16.732 --> 00:17:18.554]  Almost everyone else is sold out.
[00:17:18.554 --> 00:17:24.018]  But our supplier, MyPatriot, InfowarsStore.com, still has their entire line
[00:17:24.438 --> 00:17:25.999]  High-quality, fresh food.
[00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:27.119]  And it's fresh.
[00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.841]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered.
[00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:35.604]  Not because they don't have the food, but because they've got to package it, and their factories are going 24 hours a day.
[00:17:35.604 --> 00:17:37.105]  High-quality, fresh food.
[00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:38.465]  The best package systems.
[00:17:38.465 --> 00:17:39.226]  Tastes great.
[00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:40.466]  Protects you and your family.
[00:17:40.466 --> 00:17:41.827]  And funds the InfoWar.
[00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:46.530]  You've just got to get the orders in until they extend it out even more, which could happen.
[00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.870]  Lock in your orders now.
[00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.672]  Ensure you get it at InfoWarStore.com today.
[00:17:51.272 --> 00:18:00.143]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:18:00.143 --> 00:18:10.016]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air and I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:18.163]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:25.647]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:34.471]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party tests out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:39.014]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:40.529]  This hard.
[00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:44.450]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:55.073]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[00:18:55.073 --> 00:18:57.714]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.091]  Real stuff, man.
[00:19:01.091 --> 00:19:02.272]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[00:19:02.272 --> 00:19:07.736]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[00:19:07.736 --> 00:19:10.598]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[00:19:10.598 --> 00:19:12.299]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:15.542]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[00:19:16.082 --> 00:19:19.946]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[00:19:19.946 --> 00:19:21.187]  20 different stickers.
[00:19:21.187 --> 00:19:22.809]  Impeach the Democrats.
[00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:23.870]  Save the Second Amendment.
[00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:24.971]  Defend the First Amendment.
[00:19:24.971 --> 00:19:26.292]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:26.292 --> 00:19:27.714]  And it looks like duct tape.
[00:19:27.714 --> 00:19:28.474]  It's just a regular sticker.
[00:19:28.474 --> 00:19:29.495]  You put it over your mouth.
[00:19:29.495 --> 00:19:30.817]  You go to a Trump rally.
[00:19:30.817 --> 00:19:33.239]  And you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:34.840]  People say, why are you doing this?
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.361]  What's happening?
[00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:36.842]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[00:19:37.563 --> 00:19:38.964]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[00:19:38.964 --> 00:19:42.307]  And Dr. Puccini, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:43.287]  It's brilliant.
[00:19:43.287 --> 00:19:50.373]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[00:19:50.373 --> 00:19:53.315]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[00:19:53.315 --> 00:19:56.137]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[00:19:56.137 --> 00:20:01.742]  Silence.
[00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:04.404]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.936 --> 00:20:26.562]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:20:26.562 --> 00:20:28.823]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:51.925]  I always get just a few hours notice from Max Keiser, the famous playboy and international superstar, TV host of the BBC, RT, you name it, Al Jazeera, author, broadcaster, filmmaker, famous stockbroker, opinion trader.
[00:20:51.925 --> 00:20:56.286]  He's also co-founder of Bitcoin Capital and presenter of Keiser Report on RT.
[00:20:56.286 --> 00:20:58.987]  I first heard about Bitcoin from him like 10 years ago or longer.
[00:20:59.787 --> 00:21:06.688]  MaxKaiser.com and he's with us and he wants to get into Bitcoin and global currencies and what's happening in the markets, what's happening with Coronavirus.
[00:21:06.688 --> 00:21:11.429]  First, and then we're going to get into the most concerning developments with Coronavirus.
[00:21:11.429 --> 00:21:14.149]  We had a long dinner last night.
[00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:18.490]  He, myself, his significant others, Stacey Herbert, and my wife Erica.
[00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.491]  We had an in-depth discussion and I concur with you about what's happening in China.
[00:21:22.491 --> 00:21:25.651]  That regardless of how bad the virus is, they're using it as a power grab.
[00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:27.772]  We'll look at the economy, Hillary,
[00:21:29.147 --> 00:21:35.291]  They're piggybacking on Bloomberg, what you think of the Judge of the Booty, and just a lot of really important points.
[00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:36.392]  What you think of Bill Barr?
[00:21:36.392 --> 00:21:38.633]  You think Bill Barr's good, you were telling me last night.
[00:21:38.633 --> 00:21:42.176]  I hope that's the case, and that he's not undermining the President.
[00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:47.559]  Now we've got 1,100 former ex-DOJ officials demanding Barr resign.
[00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:49.180]  So, you know, maybe you're right.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.281]  Maybe Barr is good.
[00:21:50.281 --> 00:21:53.663]  I just want to see some major action on the whole Epstein front.
[00:21:53.663 --> 00:21:56.425]  So it's good to have you here back in the ATX.
[00:21:56.425 --> 00:21:57.766]  I'm glad you called me when you landed.
[00:21:58.266 --> 00:22:00.167]  Yesterday I called in from the plane.
[00:22:00.167 --> 00:22:00.807]  I was dialing.
[00:22:00.807 --> 00:22:02.268]  I'm on the tarmac.
[00:22:02.268 --> 00:22:07.830]  I'm heading into South Congress in Austin to be as hipster and trendy as possible.
[00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.071]  And you're like, yeah, that's right.
[00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:09.791]  Come right over now.
[00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:11.032]  We've got some barbecue.
[00:22:11.032 --> 00:22:12.012]  Don't stop.
[00:22:12.012 --> 00:22:14.713]  I got some great barbecue right here at the headquarters.
[00:22:14.713 --> 00:22:15.894]  And we just came right over.
[00:22:16.886 --> 00:22:18.187]  And that's, of course, that's what we do.
[00:22:18.187 --> 00:22:24.411]  Now, Bitcoin, you missed at a dollar, you missed it at ten dollars, you missed it at a hundred dollars, you missed it at a thousand dollars.
[00:22:24.411 --> 00:22:34.317]  The good news, Alex Jones, is that Bitcoin at ten thousand dollars or nine thousand three hundred dollars is equally attractive as it was at a hundred dollars.
[00:22:34.317 --> 00:22:37.258]  I am officially raising my target for Bitcoin.
[00:22:37.258 --> 00:22:39.320]  And I first made this prediction when it was a dollar.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.301]  I said this could go to a hundred thousand dollars.
[00:22:41.781 --> 00:22:45.262]  I'm raising my official target for the first time in eight years.
[00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:47.862]  I'm raising it to $400,000.
[00:22:47.862 --> 00:22:49.263]  That's my new official target.
[00:22:49.263 --> 00:22:52.524]  So you've got a 40X return.
[00:22:52.524 --> 00:22:55.024]  You know, $10,000 becomes $400,000.
[00:22:55.024 --> 00:23:03.126]  And so this is yet your new chance to make the Bitcoin phenomenon work for you, Alex Jones.
[00:23:03.126 --> 00:23:07.447]  And I told you over 10 years ago, I wasn't going to get into it until I thought the market stabilized.
[00:23:07.447 --> 00:23:08.648]  I know it's a real technology.
[00:23:08.648 --> 00:23:09.288]  I know it's needed.
[00:23:11.403 --> 00:23:14.624]  Our government, George Washington, beat the British because of encryption.
[00:23:14.624 --> 00:23:17.305]  Encryption was once seen as ammunition.
[00:23:17.305 --> 00:23:19.026]  Only the NSA, for a while, had it.
[00:23:19.026 --> 00:23:20.587]  It's good to have it in the people's hands.
[00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:24.909]  But there's also been a wild, wild West and a lot of crap coin out there as well.
[00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:27.029]  But still, you believe Bitcoin?
[00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:28.430]  The original is the gold standard.
[00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:33.194]  Right, everything but Bitcoin is basically pyrite, or fool's gold.
[00:23:33.194 --> 00:23:35.437]  There's only one Bitcoin.
[00:23:35.437 --> 00:23:36.778]  Nothing else comes close.
[00:23:36.778 --> 00:23:44.625]  And now, good point, after 10 years it's been accepted by the marketplace, it's established itself, and now large money's moving into this thing.
[00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:51.372]  I was about to say, so it had its crash, but now it's going back up and the big money's going in, meaning they're not planning to extinct it, they just wanted to take it over.
[00:23:51.912 --> 00:23:57.716]  There's no reason why it wouldn't be volatile, as it makes a move from $1 to $10, $20,000.
[00:23:57.716 --> 00:23:59.397]  That's extremely volatile.
[00:23:59.397 --> 00:24:03.139]  But to get to $20,000, $100,000, or $400,000, you need the volatility.
[00:24:03.139 --> 00:24:04.640]  That's perfectly normal.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.383]  The best solution, there's a three-pronged approach that I'm going to tell you about right now.
[00:24:09.383 --> 00:24:12.865]  First of all is Cash App, which is a simple app on your phone.
[00:24:12.865 --> 00:24:15.427]  You can download this app and you can stack Satoshis.
[00:24:15.427 --> 00:24:17.288]  A Satoshi is basically
[00:24:18.368 --> 00:24:22.592]  One, it's, you know, there's a hundred Satoshis in every penny.
[00:24:22.592 --> 00:24:23.732]  Let's put it that way.
[00:24:23.732 --> 00:24:26.354]  So you can stack Satoshis on your Cash App.
[00:24:26.354 --> 00:24:30.898]  You can buy a dollar at a time, five dollars at a time, and you can build your position.
[00:24:30.898 --> 00:24:38.343]  Number two would be, if you don't want to keep your Bitcoin on that app, you can download it to something called a wallet.
[00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:40.184]  In this case, I recommend the Green Wallet.
[00:24:40.184 --> 00:24:40.945]  It's the best wallet.
[00:24:40.945 --> 00:24:42.006]  It's the most secure wallet.
[00:24:42.506 --> 00:24:49.450]  And if you want to play with the big boys, and you want to buy $10,000, $20,000 worth of Bitcoin at a time, then the place to go would be Kraken.
[00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.351]  Kraken is established since 2011.
[00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:54.613]  It's the best exchange, really, I think, in the world.
[00:24:54.613 --> 00:24:58.455]  And this is where you go when you're graduating to the big time in the Bitcoin space.
[00:24:58.455 --> 00:25:00.276]  But initially, it's Cash App.
[00:25:00.276 --> 00:25:04.058]  Just go to Cash App every single day, and you buy a few dollars worth of Bitcoin every single day.
[00:25:04.058 --> 00:25:05.879]  Now, which one of these, what I like is the fact that if...
[00:25:06.639 --> 00:25:17.728]  I can decide where it's invested or where it's kept in one of these so I can actually tailor it so that I don't have this cryptocurrency somewhere where it's helping a bad guy.
[00:25:18.356 --> 00:25:20.377]  Yeah, you can take delivery of your private keys.
[00:25:20.377 --> 00:25:20.877]  That's the whole thing.
[00:25:20.877 --> 00:25:22.298]  It's about individual sovereignty.
[00:25:22.298 --> 00:25:23.558]  It's all about the Fourth Amendment.
[00:25:23.558 --> 00:25:25.759]  You know, the Fourth Amendment guarantees privacy.
[00:25:25.759 --> 00:25:27.320]  Well, what I like is this.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.861]  I could sit there and put money in an offshore account.
[00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:33.202]  Everyone will make me a political prisoner and try to get out of the contract with my family.
[00:25:33.202 --> 00:25:35.983]  But those banks will work with other big banks just to take your money away.
[00:25:35.983 --> 00:25:41.345]  But things like Bitcoin absolutely just brings diversity to the marketplace of digital currencies.
[00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:43.406]  And it is something that is completely legitimate.
[00:25:43.766 --> 00:25:48.831]  It's just like the power of fire, not just being with the gods, but being given to Prometheus.
[00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:51.373]  It's unconfiscatable, which is great.
[00:25:51.373 --> 00:25:54.196]  So even a private account, those are all being cracked down upon.
[00:25:54.196 --> 00:25:57.479]  Those are all being looked into by various governments.
[00:25:57.479 --> 00:26:03.304]  Bitcoin is the only thing that's unconfiscatable, and it's the only thing where, when you transact, that is the verification of that transaction.
[00:26:03.564 --> 00:26:04.864]  That's something you never find with gold.
[00:26:04.864 --> 00:26:10.126]  With gold, if I traded gold with you, you would have to verify that the gold that I traded with you was real.
[00:26:10.126 --> 00:26:13.867]  It wasn't tungsten or something posing as gold.
[00:26:13.867 --> 00:26:15.508]  You need a third-party verification.
[00:26:15.508 --> 00:26:19.189]  With Bitcoin, that's not a problem because it verifies itself on the blockchain.
[00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:27.391]  Well, we've got the owner of Twitter, you've got Eric Prince, you've got all these big players, all these big governments, heavily invested in Bitcoin.
[00:26:27.391 --> 00:26:33.612]  And so clearly, they think down the road, it's going to end up being a continual powerful force.
[00:26:33.612 --> 00:26:35.173]  But you've got my point.
[00:26:35.173 --> 00:26:38.814]  I only talk about stuff that I really understand backwards and forwards.
[00:26:38.814 --> 00:26:47.676]  And so I've been waiting a decade, believing in the technology, but I just could never tell my listeners, I think this is the best way to go because I don't want to steer them wrong.
[00:26:47.676 --> 00:26:47.896]  Right.
[00:26:47.896 --> 00:26:48.476]  Well, you know,
[00:26:49.292 --> 00:26:53.134]  We're beyond that phase now where people are asking how it works.
[00:26:53.134 --> 00:26:54.114]  No, no, I agree with you.
[00:26:54.114 --> 00:26:57.856]  Because most of the things you deal with during the day, you have no idea how they work.
[00:26:57.856 --> 00:27:01.578]  People, the cars are ultimately technologically driven.
[00:27:01.578 --> 00:27:03.199]  Nobody knows how the technology in cars work.
[00:27:03.199 --> 00:27:06.240]  Nobody knows how most of the technology they deal with all day works.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.102]  It's just accepted after 10 years of being up and running flawlessly.
[00:27:10.102 --> 00:27:13.904]  Now it works, and we accept it, and people are using it as a store of value.
[00:27:13.904 --> 00:27:17.385]  It's all the fly-by-nighters and all the people running scams that
[00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:20.587]  Could have brought it down, but they didn't.
[00:27:20.587 --> 00:27:23.109]  Yeah, it withstood all the scams.
[00:27:23.109 --> 00:27:28.613]  All the, what we call, you know, the Bitcoin Cash, for example, is a scam.
[00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:30.855]  Craig Wright is a scam.
[00:27:30.855 --> 00:27:34.317]  These are some of the more obvious scams in the crypto space.
[00:27:34.317 --> 00:27:36.279]  This is your opinion, I don't really know who these guys are.
[00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:39.681]  Right, okay, but this is pretty well documented at this point.
[00:27:39.681 --> 00:27:44.164]  And everything, even Ethereum to a large degree, you can say is a scam.
[00:27:44.164 --> 00:27:46.706]  It's all the fighting in the cryptocurrencies.
[00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:47.667]  I don't like infighting.
[00:27:47.907 --> 00:27:54.210]  Right, but anytime you have a revolutionary currency like this, you get a lot of people vying for attention, and they're going to be changed.
[00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.912]  You know, I always say that you don't change Bitcoin, Bitcoin changes you.
[00:27:57.912 --> 00:28:07.777]  And as long as you understand that, you will allow yourself to open up your mind to what unconfiscatable, immutable, censorship-resistant, store-of-value, Gold 2.0 means to the world.
[00:28:07.777 --> 00:28:11.439]  It means people in Venezuela, Argentina have a way to fight back against the government.
[00:28:11.439 --> 00:28:14.220]  It means people in America have a way to fight back against the government.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.560]  Especially third-world nations.
[00:28:33.567 --> 00:28:34.408]  Well, I'll say this.
[00:28:34.408 --> 00:28:36.730]  The global markets are obviously overvalued.
[00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:42.435]  I know Trump's just trying to prop up the bubble because what other choices he have, but it is smart to diversify.
[00:28:42.435 --> 00:28:51.162]  I want to tie Bitcoin now into what's happening with the virus, what's happening with the economy, what the virus is going to do to the Chinese economy, how that affects the world economy.
[00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:54.865]  On the other side, then we'll talk about Hillary and Bloomberg kissing in a tree.
[00:28:54.865 --> 00:28:56.127]  K-S-S-S-I-N-G.
[00:28:58.385 --> 00:29:02.426]  Almost all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food.
[00:29:02.426 --> 00:29:05.467]  But I know for a fact from sources, they're telling people, oh, we've got it.
[00:29:05.467 --> 00:29:07.927]  Get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[00:29:07.927 --> 00:29:09.767]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[00:29:09.767 --> 00:29:11.088]  I've been on radio for 25 years.
[00:29:11.088 --> 00:29:13.608]  I've had storable food for a long time.
[00:29:13.608 --> 00:29:17.489]  And I learned very quickly, a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times.
[00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:21.050]  But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory.
[00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.030]  They'll still take your orders.
[00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:37.300]  That's why about 11 years ago I found My Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there and I became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.203]  Now they were saying 7 to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food but they've got to package it, record level orders.
[00:29:42.503 --> 00:29:47.267]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[00:29:47.267 --> 00:29:49.248]  So get your orders in at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:29:49.248 --> 00:29:50.249]  Get the best deals.
[00:29:50.249 --> 00:29:51.350]  Get it delivered first.
[00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.190]  They're in our system.
[00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.211]  It goes right to them.
[00:29:53.211 --> 00:29:54.572]  Then it funds the M4 as well.
[00:29:54.572 --> 00:29:55.312]  So get prepared.
[00:29:55.312 --> 00:29:57.274]  InfoWarsaw.com with Sorible Foods.
[00:29:58.953 --> 00:30:05.619]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election, and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[00:30:05.619 --> 00:30:16.129]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in the
[00:30:16.709 --> 00:30:26.031]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[00:30:26.031 --> 00:30:38.113]  That's why it's so critical to go to InfoWarStore.com and stock up on high-quality preparedness items from storable foods, high-quality water filtration, air filtration, to the very best supplements and silver products you're going to find.
[00:30:38.113 --> 00:30:45.935]  They're all available at InfoWarStore.com, and your purchase there not only ensures high-quality products for you and your family at great prices, but it funds the InfoWar
[00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:51.739]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[00:30:51.739 --> 00:30:54.580]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.301]  He's like, well, what are you doing?
[00:30:56.301 --> 00:31:00.344]  Just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people.
[00:31:00.344 --> 00:31:01.325]  So here I am telling people.
[00:31:14.953 --> 00:31:25.100]  Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:36.628]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:38.869]  It feels so good.
[00:31:38.869 --> 00:31:42.071]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[00:31:42.071 --> 00:31:44.373]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[00:31:45.093 --> 00:32:08.933]  Three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world a lot of people that never deliver Well, I'm here to tell you InfoWars has delivered in royal flush
[00:32:10.779 --> 00:32:18.090]  A handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at InfoWars.
[00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:21.434]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:21.434 --> 00:32:25.340]  So right now, Humanity's Awakening is explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[00:32:26.121 --> 00:32:35.469]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on Jim Folwar's Citizen's Tip of the Spear is your financial support.
[00:32:35.469 --> 00:32:38.451]  We make it really easy at jimfolwarstore.com.
[00:32:38.451 --> 00:32:42.975]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our reporter.
[00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:44.397]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:27.811 --> 00:33:30.753]  Max Keiser, quite the character.
[00:33:30.753 --> 00:33:32.334]  Very informative.
[00:33:32.334 --> 00:33:33.635]  Eccentric.
[00:33:33.635 --> 00:33:35.917]  In the dictionary, next to the word eccentric.
[00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.972]  And the encyclopedia is a picture of Max Keiser, or at least there should be.
[00:33:40.972 --> 00:33:42.033]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:42.033 --> 00:33:45.655]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday transmission.
[00:33:45.655 --> 00:33:48.157]  By the way, you didn't come on here to pitch Bitcoin.
[00:33:48.157 --> 00:33:52.619]  You don't own part of those companies you just pitched, and they're not paying me.
[00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:56.561]  What happened is, he was coming through connecting from another city, from another country.
[00:33:56.561 --> 00:33:58.763]  Today, let's get dinner.
[00:33:58.763 --> 00:34:00.084]  And then I said, listen, you're right.
[00:34:00.084 --> 00:34:02.745]  I should have gotten involved in Bitcoin and things a long time ago.
[00:34:02.745 --> 00:34:04.226]  Now it's settled out.
[00:34:04.226 --> 00:34:05.207]  Will you, will you
[00:34:06.454 --> 00:34:07.214]  Explain it to me.
[00:34:07.214 --> 00:34:12.056]  Will you take me under your wing and really walk me through it?
[00:34:12.056 --> 00:34:13.577]  And he said, yes.
[00:34:13.577 --> 00:34:15.817]  But he said, here's just the three basic things you need to know.
[00:34:15.817 --> 00:34:18.578]  You just start using them, because it's good to diversify anyway.
[00:34:18.578 --> 00:34:21.379]  So I want to get into China, the economy.
[00:34:21.379 --> 00:34:22.800]  Obviously, I don't want the bubble to pop.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.540]  Neither does Trump.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.801]  It's not that the bubble's a good thing.
[00:34:24.801 --> 00:34:26.201]  I'm totally against it.
[00:34:26.201 --> 00:34:29.042]  But clearly, they're just pumping more liquidity.
[00:34:29.042 --> 00:34:31.123]  They're talking about paying banks to loan now.
[00:34:31.123 --> 00:34:31.763]  Governments are.
[00:34:31.763 --> 00:34:32.403]  This is crazy.
[00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:34.224]  So I want to get your real economic outlook.
[00:34:35.084 --> 00:34:49.632]  Here in a moment, but first, get back to our conversation last night and kind of, and on the drawing board in there, in my office, you were explaining to me the three companies that you say are good that I should start using and getting involved in to teach myself.
[00:34:49.632 --> 00:34:49.972]  Right.
[00:34:49.972 --> 00:34:53.554]  And first of all, did I mention my Twitter handle is now RealMaxKaiser?
[00:34:53.554 --> 00:35:02.259]  Because I had a quarter billion followers on Max Kaiser, but I realized that I'm rebirthing myself as a maximalist in the Bitcoin space for the 2020, the 21st century.
[00:35:04.039 --> 00:35:12.367]  So this is the trifecta of Bitcoin that anyone can basically dive in and become extremely proficient at Bitcoin.
[00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:14.750]  The first one would be the Cash app.
[00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:20.175]  So the Cash app, you can download that on your phone and you can buy minuscule amounts of Bitcoin just to get started.
[00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:22.918]  We say in the Bitcoin space, stack satoshis or stack sats.
[00:35:22.998 --> 00:35:23.558]  Every single day.
[00:35:44.452 --> 00:35:55.379]  Accumulating Bitcoin without any effort whatsoever, as this price goes from the $9,000, $10,000 area up to $400,000, which is my new price target, because it's going to equal the value of gold.
[00:35:55.379 --> 00:35:57.720]  Gold's worth about $7.5 trillion.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:06.305]  Bitcoin at $400,000 would be worth about $7.5 trillion, and that's where it's going, because now it competes with gold globally, and it's used as a safe haven and a store of value.
[00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:10.029]  By the way, you were the first guy I ever heard talk about this more than 10 years ago.
[00:36:10.029 --> 00:36:11.750]  People are going to look at the three things you mentioned.
[00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.272]  You said this last night and I went and looked them up.
[00:36:13.272 --> 00:36:14.893]  I mean, I knew what Cash App was.
[00:36:14.893 --> 00:36:17.396]  I knew that Jack Dorsey was invested in it.
[00:36:17.396 --> 00:36:18.377]  Well, exactly.
[00:36:18.377 --> 00:36:25.424]  Folks, the ones that are going to end up being the most legitimate and the ones that have run the longest, the best, those are going to have the establishment start investing in them.
[00:36:25.424 --> 00:36:30.109]  And then that's when I'm like, hey, now I can tell listeners and myself, time to stick the toe in.
[00:36:30.849 --> 00:36:35.474]  Sure, a lot of folks made fortunes in the wild, wild west of all the stuff that went on the last 10 years.
[00:36:35.474 --> 00:36:37.676]  People said, Alex, why did you never get involved in it?
[00:36:37.676 --> 00:36:43.741]  Because I just, I only, look, I know when I sell somebody, you've got my super silver toothpaste.
[00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:44.522]  Yes, I have.
[00:36:44.522 --> 00:36:46.104]  It's patented, it's super high quality.
[00:36:46.824 --> 00:36:52.229]  And it knocks out viruses and bacteria, and it makes your teeth incredibly clean, and it re-memorizes them.
[00:36:52.229 --> 00:36:56.712]  So I'm selling something good that I know people are going to get a great response with.
[00:36:56.712 --> 00:37:00.415]  That's why I've been promoting colloidal silver type products for 25 years.
[00:37:00.415 --> 00:37:01.676]  Back then they weren't accepted.
[00:37:01.676 --> 00:37:04.639]  Now they're totally accepted, even by hospitals, you name it.
[00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:06.100]  It smells like Nancy Pelosi.
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.322]  That's kind of an added benefit when you get this.
[00:37:08.322 --> 00:37:09.663]  It smells like death?
[00:37:09.663 --> 00:37:11.625]  Super silver toothpaste.
[00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:13.306]  It smells like a dead dog?
[00:37:13.306 --> 00:37:14.367]  No it doesn't.
[00:37:14.367 --> 00:37:15.488]  Let me see that toothpaste.
[00:37:15.968 --> 00:37:18.468]  Don't take my toothpaste, buddy!
[00:37:18.468 --> 00:37:19.329]  I've got it!
[00:37:19.329 --> 00:37:20.789]  I've got the toothpaste now!
[00:37:20.789 --> 00:37:22.329]  He's shooting me.
[00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:23.749]  Look, um... Oh, that's it.
[00:37:23.749 --> 00:37:24.790]  What's going on?
[00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.110]  Oh, don't bring out the .50 caliber again.
[00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:27.810]  No!
[00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:28.450]  Don't do it!
[00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:33.771]  I was just trying to... Just because you didn't buy Bitcoin at a dollar!
[00:37:33.771 --> 00:37:34.631]  Don't blame me!
[00:37:34.631 --> 00:37:37.372]  I begged you to buy Bitcoin at a dollar!
[00:37:37.372 --> 00:37:39.012]  And you said no!
[00:37:39.012 --> 00:37:43.153]  It's a conspiracy from... from... Give us your Bitcoin!
[00:37:44.912 --> 00:37:48.454]  No, it's not a George Soros conspiracy, believe it or not.
[00:37:48.454 --> 00:37:51.696]  Not everything is a Soros conspiracy, Alex Jones.
[00:37:51.696 --> 00:37:54.097]  Some things are actually what they are.
[00:37:54.097 --> 00:37:54.878]  They're good.
[00:37:54.878 --> 00:37:55.598]  Oh, he needs some more.
[00:37:55.598 --> 00:37:57.059]  There you go.
[00:37:57.059 --> 00:37:59.641]  I am deadly serious.
[00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:01.662]  Let's talk global economy right now.
[00:38:01.662 --> 00:38:03.423]  How is this virus going to affect China?
[00:38:04.742 --> 00:38:09.026]  Oh, well, the supply lines coming out of China are completely interrupted.
[00:38:09.026 --> 00:38:15.031]  So in the case of Apple Computer, for example, I'm not sure how they're going to continue in their business.
[00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:20.576]  But I do have a suspicion of what they will continue to do is they will buy back their own stock.
[00:38:20.576 --> 00:38:25.200]  You know, for the last five years, Apple's earnings have not really gone up much at all.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:31.105]  But the stock goes up because they keep buying back their own stock, which makes it look like the earnings are better than they really are.
[00:38:31.545 --> 00:38:35.188]  And they're able to do that by borrowing money from the central bank at 0% interest rates.
[00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:38.331]  That's one of the nefarious impacts of 0% interest rates.
[00:38:38.331 --> 00:38:38.691]  Exactly.
[00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:45.457]  Michael Bloomberg doesn't really have... They make a huge money on their stock options and meanwhile you and I are paying 19% on our credit cards?
[00:38:45.457 --> 00:38:47.078]  That's interest rate apartheid!
[00:38:47.078 --> 00:38:53.224]  How come I live in a Bantustan where my credit card rate is 19% and Tim Cook gets to live on the other side of the...
[00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.126]  Interest rate apartheid wall?
[00:38:55.126 --> 00:39:02.234]  Borrow money at zero percent, buy back his own stock, which used to be illegal just a few years ago, pump up his stock options and make billions of dollars.
[00:39:02.234 --> 00:39:03.375]  How is that legal?
[00:39:03.375 --> 00:39:04.356]  How is that moral?
[00:39:04.356 --> 00:39:07.400]  How is that American?
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.641]  Over to you now.
[00:39:08.641 --> 00:39:09.882]  What's wrong with Tim Cook's eyes?
[00:39:10.902 --> 00:39:13.583]  Well, um, he's a cyborg.
[00:39:13.583 --> 00:39:16.124]  I think that's pretty well understood at this point.
[00:39:16.124 --> 00:39:21.507]  And, um, I'll tell you something about Steve Jobs, but actually it's not nice, so I won't.
[00:39:21.507 --> 00:39:25.508]  He's passed away, so I won't tell the ugly truth about Steve Jobs.
[00:39:25.508 --> 00:39:27.189]  I'd rather talk about the future.
[00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:31.050]  No, after Cash App, the thing you gotta keep in mind is Green Wallet.
[00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:32.970]  Because let's say you don't like Jack Dorsey.
[00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:39.552]  Let's say you're like, oh, Jack Dorsey is a censoring social media clown and I don't want anything to do with him.
[00:39:39.552 --> 00:39:41.532]  I don't care, he's got a great app called Cash App.
[00:39:41.532 --> 00:39:46.313]  Well, he does have a great app called Cash App and you can buy Bitcoin really easily and you can do it every single day.
[00:39:46.313 --> 00:39:50.494]  If you don't want to keep it on Cash App, you can move it to something called Green Wallet.
[00:39:50.894 --> 00:39:55.318]  GreenWallet is the best Bitcoin wallet on the market today.
[00:39:55.318 --> 00:39:56.899]  That's what I was going to say, though.
[00:39:56.899 --> 00:39:57.539]  GreenWallet.
[00:39:57.539 --> 00:39:58.340]  Download GreenWallet now.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.242]  Download GreenWallet now.
[00:40:00.242 --> 00:40:01.523]  That's enough.
[00:40:01.523 --> 00:40:08.769]  We already have problems with like PayPal kicking journalists and people off of it, myself included.
[00:40:08.769 --> 00:40:09.589]  Yes.
[00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:13.212]  So that's another reason about the head of Twitter.
[00:40:13.212 --> 00:40:18.717]  He's buying up all of the internet processing banks and then censoring people.
[00:40:18.717 --> 00:40:20.318]  These dudes are real jerks, man.
[00:40:20.678 --> 00:40:25.700]  Yeah, they come under a lot of pressure from governments to do all kinds of things that are anti-constitutional.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:31.262]  But nevertheless, for the newbie, the noob out there who just wants... People ask me all the time, how do I get into Bitcoin?
[00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:32.462]  This is the easiest way to do it.
[00:40:32.462 --> 00:40:33.743]  It just happens to be the easiest way.
[00:40:33.743 --> 00:40:35.343]  Once you secure your coin... No, you're right.
[00:40:35.343 --> 00:40:38.564]  We have to fund the revolution by making it go mainstream.
[00:40:38.564 --> 00:40:40.425]  That's what revolutions are supposed to do, is succeed.
[00:40:41.085 --> 00:40:42.106]  Exactly right.
[00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:52.314]  And you know, this revolution is going to be successful because the regulators who are in position to try to stop this revolution, when they start buying Bitcoin, then the revolution is won.
[00:40:52.314 --> 00:40:54.896]  Because the regulators get paid in fiat money, dollars.
[00:40:54.896 --> 00:40:57.438]  And those fiat money dollars are becoming increasingly worthless.
[00:40:57.918 --> 00:41:03.079]  So as they reject fiat money and take Bitcoin themselves, then the cops join the revolution, then we win.
[00:41:03.079 --> 00:41:04.139]  And that's happening now.
[00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:15.741]  A lot of regulators are quitting their jobs as regulators and joining Bitcoin startups because they know that this thing is unstoppable, it's unconfiscatable, it's immutable, it's the gold 2.0.
[00:41:15.741 --> 00:41:19.642]  Every single other coin out there is garbage when you compare it to Bitcoin.
[00:41:19.642 --> 00:41:21.622]  And that's how we are winning this revolution.
[00:41:21.622 --> 00:41:27.043]  Now, third point, Alex Jones, is that if you start to get $10,000 in your account and you want to join
[00:41:27.583 --> 00:41:27.984]  I think so.
[00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:55.650]  I'm not even going to do business in New York, so you can't do business in New York, but they do it every other state, except New York and Washington state, but every other state you can buy on Kraken.
[00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:56.931]  It's the best exchange in the world.
[00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:00.674]  This is how you expand your Bitcoin empire.
[00:42:00.674 --> 00:42:01.614]  So there's three steps.
[00:42:01.614 --> 00:42:04.356]  Cash app, green wallet, Kraken.
[00:42:04.356 --> 00:42:15.224]  That's the trifecta, the holy trinity of Bitcoin individual sovereignty to take yourself out of the matrix and to own your own future and respect the Constitution!
[00:42:15.224 --> 00:42:15.845]  By the way,
[00:42:16.505 --> 00:42:17.785]  We went out to dinner last night.
[00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:22.006]  He wasn't even going to come on the show, but he said, if I do, I only talk Bitcoin now!
[00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:22.966]  Everything is Bitcoin.
[00:42:22.966 --> 00:42:27.587]  As you can see, I'm reborn as Real Max Keiser on Twitter.
[00:42:27.587 --> 00:42:34.328]  I've abandoned the old Max Keiser, because even on the old Max Keiser on Twitter, I mentioned other things than Bitcoin.
[00:42:34.328 --> 00:42:38.049]  I'm now just pure Bitcoin, Real Max Keiser on Twitter.
[00:42:38.049 --> 00:42:38.769]  I am a purist.
[00:42:38.769 --> 00:42:41.030]  I'm a maximalist, and we're going to $400,000 on Bitcoin.
[00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.090]  All right, let's get... Okay, okay.
[00:42:43.877 --> 00:42:51.469]  I really want to cover the waterfront, Avenatti, Hillary and Bloomberg, the virus, China, the global economy with you when we come back.
[00:42:51.469 --> 00:42:54.975]  And then Mike Adams is going to be here next hour.
[00:42:54.975 --> 00:42:56.117]  Max Keiser is with us.
[00:42:56.117 --> 00:42:56.438]  Stay with us.
[00:42:58.357 --> 00:43:11.814]  I have confirmed with high-level sources that President Trump is intending to either pardon Roger Stone after his sentencing or give him clemency, saying the conviction stands, but you now basically don't go to jail.
[00:43:11.814 --> 00:43:14.177]  Either way, this is incredibly good news.
[00:43:15.058 --> 00:43:17.099]  Let's not forget Julian Assange.
[00:43:17.099 --> 00:43:22.162]  That's one of the biggest black marks on Trump is that he famously said, I don't know who got the emails.
[00:43:22.162 --> 00:43:23.803]  I don't know where they came from.
[00:43:23.803 --> 00:43:27.685]  The Russians, a fat dude in his mom's basement, whoever's got them, release them.
[00:43:27.685 --> 00:43:31.106]  It's about Hillary committing a crime, not who has the emails.
[00:43:31.106 --> 00:43:32.347]  Don't change the subject.
[00:43:32.347 --> 00:43:35.369]  Well, Julian Assange undoubtedly took Trump over the top.
[00:43:35.369 --> 00:43:37.049]  The WikiLeaks exposed the deep state.
[00:43:37.049 --> 00:43:38.270]  The man is a hero.
[00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:39.671]  Daniel Ellsberg was a hero.
[00:43:40.211 --> 00:43:45.737]  Assange is even a bigger hero and he's rotting in solitary confinement and at court hearings can barely talk.
[00:43:45.737 --> 00:43:51.583]  President Trump, do the right thing and ask the British to release Julian Assange and give him a medal.
[00:43:51.583 --> 00:43:54.326]  President Trump, you must release Julian Assange!
[00:43:54.326 --> 00:43:55.207]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:43:55.207 --> 00:43:57.109]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:44:00.814 --> 00:44:11.260]  Cobra Commander here reminding you to not own firearms, to not take supplements, to not get sunshine, and to not love Jesus.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:19.766]  And of course, do not get storable foods or any other types of colloidal or nano-silver at InfoWarstore.com.
[00:44:19.766 --> 00:44:21.647]  Do not do it.
[00:44:21.647 --> 00:44:26.850]  Trust CNN, trust MSNBC, drink fluoridated water,
[00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:36.356]  Just like the loving kiss of a king cobra, pumping deadly, I mean loving, healthful nutrients into your body.
[00:44:36.356 --> 00:44:38.137]  Hug the cobra.
[00:44:38.137 --> 00:44:39.918]  Love the cobra.
[00:44:39.918 --> 00:44:41.419]  Kiss the cobra.
[00:44:41.419 --> 00:44:49.164]  But never, never go to InfoWars.com or InfoWarsStore.com!
[00:44:49.164 --> 00:44:52.066]  Do not order those products!
[00:44:52.066 --> 00:44:53.627]  Silence Jones!
[00:44:59.335 --> 00:45:11.043]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[00:45:11.043 --> 00:45:19.830]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:25.077]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[00:45:25.077 --> 00:45:31.006]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[00:45:31.006 --> 00:45:36.094]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[00:45:36.574 --> 00:45:46.497]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[00:45:46.497 --> 00:45:49.237]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[00:45:49.237 --> 00:45:51.818]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[00:45:51.818 --> 00:45:54.919]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:58.340]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[00:46:00.677 --> 00:46:09.145]  Three weeks ago, we told you the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers for the coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told.
[00:46:09.145 --> 00:46:11.107]  Now we know that that is the case.
[00:46:11.107 --> 00:46:17.334]  And we know the federal government and major corporations have been buying up all the major storable food supplies around the country.
[00:46:17.334 --> 00:46:19.175]  Almost everyone else is sold out.
[00:46:19.175 --> 00:46:24.621]  But our supplier, MyPatriot, and InfowarsStore.com still has their entire line
[00:46:25.041 --> 00:46:26.602]  High quality, fresh food.
[00:46:26.602 --> 00:46:27.723]  And it's fresh.
[00:46:27.723 --> 00:46:30.284]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered.
[00:46:30.284 --> 00:46:36.208]  Not because they don't have the food, but because they've got to package it and their factories are going 24 hours a day.
[00:46:36.208 --> 00:46:37.709]  High quality, fresh food.
[00:46:37.709 --> 00:46:39.070]  The best package systems.
[00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:39.831]  Tastes great.
[00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:41.071]  Protects you and your family.
[00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:42.432]  And funds the InfoWar.
[00:46:42.432 --> 00:46:47.135]  You've just got to get the orders in until they extend it out even more, which could happen.
[00:46:47.135 --> 00:46:48.496]  Lock in your orders now.
[00:46:48.496 --> 00:46:51.278]  Ensure you get it at InfoWarStore.com today.
[00:46:51.878 --> 00:47:02.230]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:04.853]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:11.517 --> 00:47:18.262]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:18.262 --> 00:47:21.885]  By the way, when you see his shows on RT, BBC, Alex is here.
[00:47:21.885 --> 00:47:22.225]  Yeah.
[00:47:22.225 --> 00:47:23.586]  He's so professional.
[00:47:23.586 --> 00:47:24.227]  Totally.
[00:47:24.227 --> 00:47:27.449]  He comes on the show to misbehave.
[00:47:27.449 --> 00:47:28.750]  By the way, we were having... Because it's weird.
[00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:29.271]  It's Austin.
[00:47:29.271 --> 00:47:29.871]  Keep it weird.
[00:47:29.871 --> 00:47:31.913]  Keep it weird, Austin.
[00:47:31.913 --> 00:47:33.494]  That's the brand from Austin.
[00:47:33.494 --> 00:47:36.696]  We were having a Nerf gun battle earlier.
[00:47:36.696 --> 00:47:36.796]  Yeah.
[00:47:37.757 --> 00:47:39.658]  But I can't, you should let me have one.
[00:47:39.658 --> 00:47:42.180]  So I came back in here, I have two, you have none.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.902]  That's how communist China works or an authoritarian state.
[00:47:45.902 --> 00:47:48.724]  I have the guns and you don't have anything.
[00:47:48.724 --> 00:47:54.708]  I have super silver toothpaste, which is as powerful as all your weaponry in fighting the battle against cavities.
[00:47:54.708 --> 00:47:56.069]  Super silver toothpaste.
[00:47:56.069 --> 00:48:00.411]  It's made with something similar to silver and it looks really cool.
[00:48:00.411 --> 00:48:05.715]  And if you use it, a lot of women will stop you on the street and say, hi, I'd like to marry you.
[00:48:06.215 --> 00:48:07.556]  Super Silver Toothpaste.
[00:48:07.556 --> 00:48:09.377]  It's for winners.
[00:48:09.377 --> 00:48:11.378]  Available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:48:11.378 --> 00:48:14.579]  Still at 50% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:14.579 --> 00:48:14.900]  50% off!
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.300]  That's an incredible deal!
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.061]  It is actually a really good deal.
[00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:23.284]  You know, speaking of Bitcoin, if you can buy it with Bitcoin, that's an excellent way to use your Bitcoin.
[00:48:23.284 --> 00:48:23.824]  Hey!
[00:48:23.824 --> 00:48:24.384]  Yes?
[00:48:24.384 --> 00:48:25.705]  You are an enemy of the state.
[00:48:25.705 --> 00:48:26.065]  Right.
[00:48:26.065 --> 00:48:26.746]  Okay, great.
[00:48:26.746 --> 00:48:27.306]  No problem.
[00:48:27.666 --> 00:48:28.488]  That's fine.
[00:48:28.488 --> 00:48:30.671]  I get all the guns, you get nothing.
[00:48:30.671 --> 00:48:39.325]  I still have my Bitcoin to keep me safe from unreasonable search and seizure in the Fourth Amendment and the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[00:48:39.325 --> 00:48:41.428]  Don't you feel safer in a country where only the government has the guns?
[00:48:42.423 --> 00:48:44.544]  No, no Alex, I don't.
[00:48:44.544 --> 00:48:48.666]  I feel safer in a country that has a reserve currency of Bitcoin.
[00:48:48.666 --> 00:48:50.187]  That would be the safest currency.
[00:48:50.187 --> 00:48:51.088]  Did you hear something scary?
[00:48:51.088 --> 00:48:53.469]  He just pointed at my jewels!
[00:48:53.469 --> 00:48:54.829]  You're pointing those Nerf guns at my junk.
[00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:56.010]  This is fully powered up right now.
[00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:57.091]  At my thwong thwong.
[00:48:57.091 --> 00:48:58.792]  You know what that means?
[00:48:58.792 --> 00:48:59.892]  One wrong move, buddy.
[00:48:59.892 --> 00:49:01.373]  One wrong move.
[00:49:01.373 --> 00:49:02.033]  Wow.
[00:49:02.033 --> 00:49:02.834]  That's power.
[00:49:02.834 --> 00:49:03.974]  See that?
[00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:05.975]  That is power.
[00:49:05.975 --> 00:49:06.516]  See that?
[00:49:06.516 --> 00:49:07.216]  That's awesome.
[00:49:07.216 --> 00:49:07.936]  Right in the lens.
[00:49:07.936 --> 00:49:08.657]  One wrong move.
[00:49:09.522 --> 00:49:10.403]  Now.
[00:49:10.403 --> 00:49:12.166]  Your aim is getting better.
[00:49:12.166 --> 00:49:13.908]  You tell me you love Hillary right now.
[00:49:13.908 --> 00:49:17.993]  How would you like me to set flame to all of your food for a decade?
[00:49:17.993 --> 00:49:19.916]  The superfood.
[00:49:19.916 --> 00:49:21.858]  It's a whole pyramid of superfood.
[00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:23.961]  How about a bullet?
[00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:24.983]  Set it on fire.
[00:49:24.983 --> 00:49:25.703]  Back to camera 7, please.
[00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:36.571]  This is fun!
[00:49:36.571 --> 00:49:38.534]  Alright, I'll tell you what.
[00:49:38.534 --> 00:49:39.475]  Ultimate fish oil.
[00:49:39.475 --> 00:49:41.037]  You actually live in America.
[00:49:41.037 --> 00:49:42.619]  The citizens have guns as well as the government.
[00:49:42.619 --> 00:49:43.981]  Reduce your cholesterol levels.
[00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:44.622]  Here you go.
[00:49:44.622 --> 00:49:44.942]  Quickly.
[00:49:45.683 --> 00:49:46.783]  And that's what you need, isn't it?
[00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:47.764]  Super Fish Oil.
[00:49:47.764 --> 00:49:53.826]  Why sit down to a plate of 50 pounds of cod when you can just pop one of these tablets and get the same benefit?
[00:49:53.826 --> 00:49:55.407]  It's Super Fish Oil.
[00:49:55.407 --> 00:49:56.427]  Ultimate Fish Oil.
[00:49:56.427 --> 00:49:57.988]  Today a special deal.
[00:49:57.988 --> 00:50:01.989]  Super Silver Special Toothpaste and Fish Oil for 89.7% off.
[00:50:01.989 --> 00:50:03.710]  If you pay in Bitcoin, we'll pay you $500 back.
[00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:04.730]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:50:08.952 --> 00:50:10.594]  Why do you act like this on my show?
[00:50:10.594 --> 00:50:13.136]  You're doing such a professional... Hillary's laughing right now.
[00:50:13.136 --> 00:50:17.501]  You're doing such a professional job on your own international program that airs in a hundred and something countries?
[00:50:17.501 --> 00:50:27.370]  There's a hundred countries, 30 million people a week watch the Kaiser Report and it's now seen, it's dubbed into Spanish and those shows are seen even more widely than our English-speaking Kaiser Report.
[00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:28.952]  But you don't act like a clown on that show.
[00:50:29.252 --> 00:50:33.236]  Well, that's because I'm in Austin, Texas, and in Austin, Texas, you gotta keep it weird.
[00:50:33.236 --> 00:50:35.458]  I, I, we don't respond to my environment.
[00:50:35.458 --> 00:50:36.319]  I'm a human being.
[00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:36.879]  I'm an organic being.
[00:50:36.879 --> 00:50:38.001]  This broadcast comes out of Austin.
[00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.102]  We're not in Austin.
[00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.403]  We are frickin' in Austin.
[00:50:40.403 --> 00:50:40.823]  We are not in Austin.
[00:50:40.823 --> 00:50:43.406]  I'm gonna give the address right now if you want to send your love notes.
[00:50:43.406 --> 00:50:45.107]  This is a small... Here we are.
[00:50:45.107 --> 00:50:45.428]  What?
[00:50:45.428 --> 00:50:46.889]  Small part of Texas.
[00:50:46.889 --> 00:50:47.510]  Right.
[00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.291]  A little reservation of Texas here.
[00:50:49.291 --> 00:50:49.972]  Right.
[00:50:49.972 --> 00:50:51.253]  They pushed the Native Americans back.
[00:50:51.253 --> 00:50:52.254]  They got little areas.
[00:50:52.254 --> 00:50:53.676]  My office is still Texas.
[00:50:54.352 --> 00:50:54.813]  Really?
[00:50:54.813 --> 00:51:00.438]  You know, I thought that your offices were like the Vatican, the City of London, and Washington D.C.
[00:51:00.438 --> 00:51:05.183]  It's its own nation state with its own police force and its own set of rules.
[00:51:05.183 --> 00:51:07.325]  I thought, here, that was the case.
[00:51:09.153 --> 00:51:09.834]  Wow.
[00:51:09.834 --> 00:51:12.336]  I think the globalists have lost the anti-gun battle.
[00:51:12.336 --> 00:51:14.738]  That's like the old Norelco shaver ads.
[00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:22.885]  Remember the Christmas Norelco shaver ads where like Santa Claus was skiing down your face as an electric shaver?
[00:51:22.885 --> 00:51:26.148]  We have a massive Lister ship that really wants to get serious.
[00:51:26.148 --> 00:51:27.949]  You know... Give me... Stop it!
[00:51:27.949 --> 00:51:31.893]  This fish oil product is great, but when I was a kid, you know, we just sniffed glue.
[00:51:31.893 --> 00:51:32.453]  You know, that was...
[00:51:33.194 --> 00:51:38.240]  Give me three minutes serious on the global bubble and where do you think it will pop and how long can they keep it pumped up?
[00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:58.492]  Well, it all depends on how expansive the central banks will get in buying back a lot of this junk.
[00:51:58.492 --> 00:52:04.674]  So the central banks have in America, I think it's four or four and a half trillion worth of bad debts on their balance sheets.
[00:52:04.674 --> 00:52:09.677]  The ECB now has, you know, a similar quantity of bad, bad debts.
[00:52:09.677 --> 00:52:13.818]  And so they have to keep coordinating and Bank of Japan similarly.
[00:52:13.818 --> 00:52:14.859]  They have to coordinate this.
[00:52:15.439 --> 00:52:27.648]  Asset purchases are quantitative easing where all of the mistakes made by the globalists or Tim Cook or Jeff Bezos or whomever are purchased from them for treasury bills and they get to wash their sins.
[00:52:27.648 --> 00:52:35.755]  It's a huge money laundering operation at the central banks and as long as the interest rates are zero, there's no cost to them because the borrowing costs are zero.
[00:52:36.215 --> 00:52:49.770]  So I think, you know, the question with the coronavirus, to bring it back to that, the question always with the coronavirus is, is it going to be more disruptive than the central bank's ability to paper it over with more money printing?
[00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.012]  That's the only question.
[00:52:51.012 --> 00:52:53.574]  So far with the coronavirus, stock markets have gone up.
[00:52:54.235 --> 00:52:57.457]  So they've said, the central banks have said, you know what, this is a disaster.
[00:52:57.457 --> 00:52:58.518]  This is a catastrophe.
[00:52:58.518 --> 00:53:00.799]  All the supply lines are going to be interrupted.
[00:53:00.799 --> 00:53:05.062]  So what we need to do is we need to print more money to paper over the mistake.
[00:53:05.062 --> 00:53:07.143]  And all that money goes directly into the stock market.
[00:53:07.143 --> 00:53:08.684]  It doesn't go into the real economy.
[00:53:08.684 --> 00:53:09.965]  And you know how we know that?
[00:53:09.965 --> 00:53:12.126]  Look at one very simple chart.
[00:53:12.126 --> 00:53:14.028]  It's called the money velocity chart.
[00:53:14.028 --> 00:53:17.550]  And it shows you how fast the money is circulating through the economy.
[00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:19.151]  It's hitting new all-time lows.
[00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:31.578]  Even though the money supply, M1, M2, M3, are skyrocketing, it doesn't circulate because it just goes directly into the pockets of the financiers and hedge funds and people in New York buying $200 million apartments.
[00:53:31.578 --> 00:53:36.021]  So that's why you have... Which then generates inflation in the real economy for the average Joe.
[00:53:36.653 --> 00:53:40.256]  Well, what it does is it distorts all the economic signals.
[00:53:40.256 --> 00:53:46.903]  So you have health care going up 100 percent, education costs going up 100 percent, but the economists in Washington are saying there's no inflation.
[00:53:46.903 --> 00:53:53.489]  And the reason they can say there's no inflation is because they don't count those things in their calculation for inflation so that they get the central banks to print more money.
[00:53:53.489 --> 00:53:54.950]  They don't count luxury goods.
[00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:55.991]  No, they don't count housing.
[00:53:55.991 --> 00:53:57.472]  They don't count health care.
[00:53:57.472 --> 00:53:58.854]  Let's expand on this.
[00:53:58.854 --> 00:54:00.115]  Okay, let's expand on this.
[00:54:01.195 --> 00:54:08.482]  And then the universities teach communism is the answer and they point at somebody who most their assets is in fiat.
[00:54:08.482 --> 00:54:11.765]  And obviously Jeff Bezos couldn't even spend three or four billion dollars of his money.
[00:54:11.765 --> 00:54:14.967]  It would end up crashing his stock.
[00:54:14.967 --> 00:54:16.309]  So he's not really worth 160 billion dollars.
[00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:25.682]  In reality, it's a bunch of fiat crap that would make Bernie Madoff blush, but then the average student looks at that and thinks there's really all this money out there.
[00:54:25.682 --> 00:54:33.073]  Well, what do they teach in university would be under the topic of Keynesianism, or essentially planned economic models, where
[00:54:33.633 --> 00:54:37.434]  Economists get together and they plan the economy for the betterment of all.
[00:54:37.434 --> 00:54:41.194]  That's a work, that's not a model that has ever worked really.
[00:54:41.194 --> 00:54:42.635]  It's, you can say it's socialism.
[00:54:42.635 --> 00:54:45.235]  We don't really have capitalism right now, we have crony capitalism.
[00:54:45.235 --> 00:54:47.536]  And the problem is that we don't have sound money.
[00:54:47.536 --> 00:54:51.656]  We don't have gold, certainly is not a standard for our money anymore.
[00:54:51.656 --> 00:54:58.098]  Bitcoin could be, because it is hard money like gold, but that's not a unit of account in America either for transactions.
[00:54:58.098 --> 00:55:00.058]  We have fiat money, and fiat money is easily
[00:55:00.638 --> 00:55:07.349]  Printed, and then we have a bunch of plutocrats and kleptocrats who keep changing the laws to make it easier to commit fraud.
[00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:10.595]  Because they get the first use of the money, which then makes them kings.
[00:55:10.595 --> 00:55:11.396]  The Cantillon effect.
[00:55:12.025 --> 00:55:12.925]  That's right.
[00:55:12.925 --> 00:55:18.167]  That's why all the zip codes around Washington and around the Central Bank are very rich, because they are the ones who see the money first.
[00:55:18.167 --> 00:55:27.011]  They buy stuff that goes up in price, like a rare painting, a ski chalet, and these things are part of the assets that go up as they print money.
[00:55:27.011 --> 00:55:35.714]  And by the time it reaches mom and pop store owner in the middle of the country, it's lost all of its ability to generate any kind of genuine income.
[00:55:35.714 --> 00:55:38.755]  Why is there such an East Coast, West Coast, not all the people there, but
[00:55:39.595 --> 00:55:50.578]  Just average people I run into, they'll literally think Midwesterners or Texans or people in the Southwest are idiots and they make fun of us and laugh at everybody and it's not even true what they say.
[00:55:50.578 --> 00:56:05.622]  Well, because if you are on the East Coast in New York and you're around Wall Street, you have the hand on the button that prints the money and you make it easier for your own conscience if you vilify or dehumanize people and saying they're less than human.
[00:56:05.922 --> 00:56:16.191]  They're saying, I'm printing lots of money for my own benefit and I'm destroying the American economy and the way that I can go to sleep at night is to say people in the Midwest are deplorables, like Hillary Clinton would say.
[00:56:16.191 --> 00:56:21.376]  Essentially, that's a slippery slope to dehumanization or scapegoating of people.
[00:56:21.696 --> 00:56:23.897]  Which, of course, didn't work out in the 30s, did it?
[00:56:23.897 --> 00:56:30.339]  1930s, you had a massive dehumanization and scapegoating of an entire ethnic group, and that led to catastrophe.
[00:56:30.339 --> 00:56:37.541]  But we see the same thing happening in America now, where the people who are printing the money are treating everybody else as less than human.
[00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:41.583]  And that is the slippery slope to a political catastrophe.
[00:56:41.583 --> 00:56:44.744]  Well, I think we're down the slope now, where they're saying, attack Trump supporters everywhere.
[00:56:45.504 --> 00:56:49.267]  And it doesn't even get covered in the news when they run people over with vans, you name it.
[00:56:49.267 --> 00:56:52.970]  Right, well Trump is, I think, represents Americana.
[00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:55.572]  You know, Trump is as American as apple pie.
[00:56:55.572 --> 00:57:01.997]  And, you know, while Bill Hickok, you know, he's an American icon and that's where he comes from.
[00:57:01.997 --> 00:57:07.081]  And people don't want, people want to think that if I'm American, I'm more like Barack Obama.
[00:57:07.081 --> 00:57:09.542]  He's a very smooth-talking European diplomat.
[00:57:09.542 --> 00:57:11.404]  He'd do great in Europe as a diplomat.
[00:57:11.684 --> 00:57:13.425]  He's not an American political figure.
[00:57:13.425 --> 00:57:14.005]  Exactly.
[00:57:14.005 --> 00:57:18.548]  Super slick Harvard dudes in $5,000 suits that are on private jets.
[00:57:18.548 --> 00:57:19.588]  That's not America.
[00:57:19.588 --> 00:57:22.770]  No, that's why Pete Buttigieg is not American either.
[00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:32.395]  He's just sent in there, parachuted in like a new white Barack Obama to try to disrupt things on behalf of the McKinsey's and the consultants and the plutocrats and the kleptocrats.
[00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:35.681]  Now we're getting the real smart Max Keiser here.
[00:57:35.681 --> 00:57:37.624]  We're going to come back with two more segments ahead of Mike Adams.
[00:57:37.624 --> 00:57:41.330]  Let's have you look at the races, look at Hillary and Bloomberg, all of it.
[00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:44.716]  Hour two, and Max Keiser is now here!
[00:57:44.716 --> 00:57:45.617]  Max Keiser's here!
[00:57:48.368 --> 00:57:52.411]  Almost all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food.
[00:57:52.411 --> 00:57:55.474]  But I know for a fact from sources, they're telling people, oh, we've got it.
[00:57:55.474 --> 00:57:57.936]  Get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[00:57:57.936 --> 00:57:59.777]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[00:57:59.777 --> 00:58:01.438]  I've been on radio for 25 years.
[00:58:01.438 --> 00:58:03.600]  I've had storable food for a long time.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:07.503]  And I learned very quickly, a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times.
[00:58:07.503 --> 00:58:11.026]  But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory.
[00:58:11.026 --> 00:58:12.047]  They'll still take your orders.
[00:58:12.267 --> 00:58:27.299]  That's why about 11 years ago, I found MyPatriotSupply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them, because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're gonna say they're gonna do, because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're good people.
[00:58:27.299 --> 00:58:32.203]  Now, they were saying 7 to 10 days before shipping, because they've got the food, but they've got to package it, record-level orders.
[00:58:32.503 --> 00:58:37.266]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[00:58:37.266 --> 00:58:39.247]  So get your orders in at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:58:39.247 --> 00:58:40.247]  Get the best deals.
[00:58:40.247 --> 00:58:41.348]  Get it delivered first.
[00:58:41.348 --> 00:58:42.189]  They're in our system.
[00:58:42.189 --> 00:58:43.189]  It goes right to them.
[00:58:43.189 --> 00:58:44.570]  Then it funds the Infor as well.
[00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:45.310]  So get prepared.
[00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:50.753]  InfoWarsaw.com with Sorible Foods.
[00:58:50.753 --> 00:58:51.334]  All right, folks.
[00:58:51.334 --> 00:58:52.334]  Here's the bad news.
[00:58:52.334 --> 00:59:00.219]  We've already sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle with the patented nanotech silver that's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else.
[00:59:00.919 --> 00:59:05.063]  But we do still have it in the three ounce and the one ounce for a limited time.
[00:59:05.063 --> 00:59:13.632]  The good news is we have the Super Blue toothpaste and the Super Silver toothpaste, both that have the nano silver in them as well.
[00:59:13.632 --> 00:59:19.098]  The Super Blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality iodine.
[00:59:19.398 --> 00:59:19.778]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:59:51.773 --> 00:59:58.259]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.259 --> 01:00:09.228]  You got no when to hold up, no when to fold up, no when to walk away, and no when to run.
[01:00:09.228 --> 01:00:11.270]  You never count your money.
[01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:16.975]  When you're sitting at the table, there'll be time enough to count.
[01:00:18.507 --> 01:00:22.492]  All right Max Keiser's here and he's very informative, very entertaining.
[01:00:22.492 --> 01:00:23.974]  They got really serious last week.
[01:00:23.974 --> 01:00:24.334]  I did.
[01:00:24.334 --> 01:00:25.356]  I was super serious.
[01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:25.676]  What happened?
[01:00:25.676 --> 01:00:26.177]  You know what it was?
[01:00:26.177 --> 01:00:27.498]  It was that potato soup.
[01:00:27.498 --> 01:00:32.585]  I had some of that cold storage potato soup good for 50 years and it just it gave me clarity.
[01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:35.669]  Suddenly I could see things clearly for the first time in over three hours.
[01:00:35.669 --> 01:00:36.049]  Well you know
[01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.271]  No, actually governments are buying up all the storable food.
[01:00:38.271 --> 01:00:43.076]  Most places are already sold out and we're selling more storable food than ever because of the coronavirus.
[01:00:43.076 --> 01:00:47.380]  And I just say it's good to have storable food to be prepared for whatever's coming in the future.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:51.104]  And I think Trump is trying to prop things up because he inherited this mess.
[01:00:51.104 --> 01:00:55.869]  But if the economy goes down, that's when people really do need the storable food and it funds our operation.
[01:00:55.869 --> 01:00:59.853]  You know, I just want to say that you got deplatformed because
[01:01:00.513 --> 01:01:06.035]  Rachel Maddow at NBC and MSNBC realized that your audience was huge, their audience was dying.
[01:01:06.035 --> 01:01:11.198]  So she's the new Alex Jones on MSNBC and they had to de-platform you.
[01:01:11.198 --> 01:01:14.559]  That was a coup by the corporations, mainstream media.
[01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:15.820]  It's shocking.
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:19.822]  You should be back in full regalia on every channel as you were.
[01:01:19.822 --> 01:01:24.163]  The fact that you've been de-platformed is a heinous miscarriage of media injustice.
[01:01:24.163 --> 01:01:27.065]  We were definitely way more popular than them, but that's not saying much.
[01:01:27.805 --> 01:01:28.685]  They were collapsing.
[01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:29.546]  They were collapsing.
[01:01:29.546 --> 01:01:34.048]  Now, Rachel Maddow is this raging lunatic who is trying to do you.
[01:01:34.048 --> 01:01:35.268]  She's trying to do your act.
[01:01:35.268 --> 01:01:36.909]  Essentially, you're Alex Jones.
[01:01:36.909 --> 01:01:38.210]  But she can't do it.
[01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.630]  And she's failing at it.
[01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:43.472]  And she went down the Russiagate hoax, the Ukrainegate hoax, the impeachment hoax.
[01:01:43.472 --> 01:01:48.734]  And they keep her on the air, even though she's a pale version of Alex Jones.
[01:01:48.734 --> 01:01:50.615]  Just go home already!
[01:01:50.615 --> 01:01:51.696]  Fire yourself!
[01:01:51.696 --> 01:01:52.496]  You're a disgrace!
[01:01:53.956 --> 01:01:55.281]  Not you, of course, Rachel Amato.
[01:01:55.281 --> 01:01:57.589]  Well, I'm not gay, but he's a good looking man.
[01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:08.573]  Rachel Maddow is Nancy Pelosi's intimate partner, and when they get down with some ultimate fish oil, it's a beautiful thing.
[01:02:08.573 --> 01:02:11.594]  And not even AOC can stay away from that union.
[01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:15.735]  It's like a threesome of socialism.
[01:02:15.735 --> 01:02:18.036]  All right, Max Keiser.
[01:02:18.036 --> 01:02:21.737]  Max, this is a shorter segment, long segment coming up.
[01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:23.858]  Let me just ask you a question.
[01:02:23.858 --> 01:02:24.938]  Getting back to the economy.
[01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:33.657]  As you said, the country is very divided, but Trump is winning.
[01:02:33.657 --> 01:02:36.201]  If Trump hadn't gotten in, what would you expect to happen to the economy?
[01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:48.498]  We would be at war with Russia because Hillary is a Russophobe and she's a bigot and she's a racist and she's an anti-Semite.
[01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:52.260]  A level of racial hatred towards Slavic people.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:56.722]  She's a Russophobe and she would be killing Russians because she's a psychopath.
[01:02:56.722 --> 01:02:58.543]  And that would be the first effect of a Hillary president.
[01:02:58.543 --> 01:03:00.503]  Well there is a deep state hatred of the Russians.
[01:03:00.503 --> 01:03:01.224]  Where does that come from?
[01:03:02.034 --> 01:03:11.137]  It doesn't really exist, only in the minds of some conspiracy theorists, because there's no reason to have this antipathy toward Russia.
[01:03:11.137 --> 01:03:14.538]  Russia is out there trying to do business like everybody else.
[01:03:14.538 --> 01:03:17.839]  It's not undermining anyone's elections.
[01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:22.781]  It's a country that we could have an amazing relationship with.
[01:03:22.781 --> 01:03:28.203]  Bill Maher Friday night said Roger Stone was convicted for giving the leaks to the Russians.
[01:03:29.423 --> 01:03:30.704]  No one's ever even said that.
[01:03:30.704 --> 01:03:32.605]  I think that's even backwards if you believe the lie.
[01:03:32.605 --> 01:03:34.787]  It's just pure crap.
[01:03:34.787 --> 01:03:49.296]  Julian Assange is also somebody that, if we had a functioning constitution here in America, would be somehow rescued from being tortured by UK regulators who are sadistic, torturing maniacs.
[01:03:49.296 --> 01:03:50.657]  Same thing with Edward Snowden.
[01:03:50.657 --> 01:03:52.858]  I mean, Edward Snowden basically brought clarity.
[01:03:54.019 --> 01:03:56.541]  He told Americans what was really happening behind the scenes.
[01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.623]  As we should know, we should have transparency.
[01:03:58.623 --> 01:04:02.426]  He is essentially performing a vital function for democracy.
[01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:05.468]  He also is an American hero.
[01:04:05.468 --> 01:04:18.559]  And it's just not right that this mainstream media, Rachel Maddow, CNN, MSNBC, my old friend Alec Baldwin, who I had a friendship for 30 years, the second Trump won, he immediately disowned me.
[01:04:19.019 --> 01:04:28.743]  Would never talk to me again and started sending me emails like he's going to report me to the FBI because my show is an RT, even though he's been on my show many times with Russell Brand and others.
[01:04:28.743 --> 01:04:39.027]  So this is the level of psycho war that is being perpetrated on these poor victims, these poor Americans, these people that are being turned into bigots, racists, and anti-Semites.
[01:04:39.027 --> 01:04:47.951]  Well, you told me you were there at the big after-party thing for Saturday Night Live and that they were just crying the night that Trump won.
[01:04:48.171 --> 01:04:51.481]  Yeah, they were in a puddle of tears when Hillary lost.
[01:04:51.481 --> 01:04:52.163]  We're going to break.
[01:04:52.163 --> 01:04:54.730]  Back in 60 seconds, let's talk about Hillary and that story.
[01:04:57.329 --> 01:04:58.949]  Well, it's finally happening.
[01:04:58.949 --> 01:05:05.211]  The President is coming out and saying that Deep State are a bunch of out-of-control criminals that need to be prosecuted.
[01:05:05.211 --> 01:05:15.313]  And he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the State Department and the Justice Department in just the last few days.
[01:05:15.313 --> 01:05:20.275]  And he took the head prosecutor over stone and offered her a job at Treasury.
[01:05:20.275 --> 01:05:24.115]  As soon as she quit that job, he then withdrew the nomination.
[01:05:24.115 --> 01:05:26.176]  And now she's out on her globalist ass.
[01:05:26.696 --> 01:05:28.117]  This is beautiful.
[01:05:28.117 --> 01:05:30.659]  It's happening, but we need to see a lot more.
[01:05:30.659 --> 01:05:32.880]  All the neocons need to be fired.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.282]  All the Obama appointees, fired.
[01:05:35.282 --> 01:05:39.485]  All the deep state globalists who have resumes with George Soros, fired!
[01:05:39.485 --> 01:05:40.065]  Fired!
[01:05:40.065 --> 01:05:40.605]  Fired!
[01:05:40.605 --> 01:05:41.126]  Fired!
[01:05:41.126 --> 01:05:43.247]  Trump is finally unleashed.
[01:05:43.247 --> 01:05:45.629]  Trump is not the red wave.
[01:05:45.629 --> 01:05:47.350]  He is the red storm.
[01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:50.012]  And InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.853]  Powered by we the people.
[01:05:51.853 --> 01:05:53.274]  Never backing down.
[01:05:53.274 --> 01:05:54.375]  Never giving in.
[01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:56.356]  And delivering victory in our time.
[01:06:00.104 --> 01:06:05.156]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:06:05.156 --> 01:06:06.639]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:10.618 --> 01:06:14.599]  Alright, we were just talking about the night that Trump won 2016.
[01:06:14.599 --> 01:06:19.120]  You were there amongst all the leftists and Alec Baldwin and the rest of them.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.280]  They were just crying.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.521]  It was like the end of the world had just happened.
[01:06:22.521 --> 01:06:23.001]  It was awful.
[01:06:23.001 --> 01:06:30.283]  Like, Alec Baldwin I've known for 30 years and then suddenly Hillary lost and Trump won and he doesn't recognize that Trump is an American archetype.
[01:06:30.283 --> 01:06:33.724]  He won fair and square and the Constitution didn't disappear.
[01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:36.824]  But he suddenly lashed out and he disowned a lot of people.
[01:06:36.824 --> 01:06:38.905]  Myself, he disowned his brother Stephen.
[01:06:39.005 --> 01:06:54.730]  You know, Stephen Baldwin and I did a show called The Great American Pilgrimage, and the point of the show was to make fun of Alec Baldwin for the entire series, and to just travel around America and poke fun at Alec for being such a crybaby and a sore loser.
[01:06:54.730 --> 01:07:08.075]  And so we made a show, and we didn't get into it to that extent, sadly, but that was the premise of The Great American Pilgrimage with Stephen Baldwin, was to make fun of Alec Baldwin for 16 episodes as we drove across the country.
[01:07:09.116 --> 01:07:09.537]  I don't know.
[01:07:25.785 --> 01:07:31.667]  So that at the Broker Convention, he like steps down and she goes forward, or he becomes president, and then he steps down, she becomes president.
[01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:39.169]  They even said that they could have impeached Trump and Pence, they were going to have Pelosi as president, and then she would put Hillary in as VP, and then she would step down.
[01:07:39.169 --> 01:07:41.610]  They're openly saying this constantly.
[01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:43.891]  She really still thinks she's going to run.
[01:07:43.891 --> 01:07:45.051]  Talk about tone-deaf.
[01:07:45.051 --> 01:07:46.312]  Talk about disconnected from reality.
[01:07:46.972 --> 01:07:53.818]  Well, Michael Bloomberg is essentially a Republican, so I don't know why he's representing the Democratic Party, number one.
[01:07:53.818 --> 01:08:06.510]  Number two, this idea that the Democrats have been shown to be so dysfunctional, where you have the leading guy who's leading the pack is Bernie Sanders, who's at war with billionaires, who's on a platform of socialism.
[01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:13.316]  So the DNC parachutes in, changes all their laws to bring in another billionaire from New York to go to battle with another billionaire from
[01:08:13.336 --> 01:08:13.856]  We're good to go.
[01:08:38.846 --> 01:08:39.247]  That's
[01:08:53.643 --> 01:08:53.783]  I don't
[01:09:20.586 --> 01:09:27.316]  ...the battlefield, and you don't cry about it, and she just reinforces all the negative stereotypes about having a woman leader.
[01:09:27.316 --> 01:09:34.266]  She's setting women's rights back 20 or 30 years, because she's failing to accept responsibility for her own actions.
[01:09:34.266 --> 01:09:37.030]  So it was fake news when Newsweek said she was Madam President?
[01:09:38.534 --> 01:09:43.318]  Yeah, and Nancy Pelosi is doing no great favor to women's movement either.
[01:09:43.318 --> 01:09:48.522]  I mean, she's not, you know, she doesn't respect the rule of law, the Constitution.
[01:09:48.522 --> 01:09:51.945]  What do you think is going on with Bloomberg?
[01:09:51.945 --> 01:10:00.031]  Because he's been putting memes out that either make Trump look good or make Bloomberg look like an idiot, and now he's starring in a Mary Poppins play.
[01:10:00.031 --> 01:10:01.452]  Let's cue that up.
[01:10:01.452 --> 01:10:03.013]  This is not a joke for radio listeners.
[01:10:03.013 --> 01:10:04.194]  TV viewers will actually see it.
[01:10:05.587 --> 01:10:06.648]  We played it last hour, guys.
[01:10:06.648 --> 01:10:07.869]  You guys cut the front off.
[01:10:07.869 --> 01:10:10.371]  Play it with the women cheering like he's God.
[01:10:10.371 --> 01:10:14.194]  And then he comes in and says, I'll make Americans behave.
[01:10:14.194 --> 01:10:16.416]  When, of course, the big joke is he's the nanny.
[01:10:16.416 --> 01:10:18.638]  The full video is on newswars.com.
[01:10:18.638 --> 01:10:19.058]  Cringe.
[01:10:19.058 --> 01:10:26.444]  Internet mocks Mike Bloomberg in bizarre stage play performance as Mary Poppins, the nanny mayor of New York.
[01:10:26.444 --> 01:10:29.927]  Here it is.
[01:10:29.927 --> 01:10:32.669]  I'll tell you where I'm going.
[01:10:36.493 --> 01:10:40.379]  First Iowa, then New Hampshire.
[01:10:40.379 --> 01:10:46.848]  Maybe I can get the whole country to behave.
[01:10:46.848 --> 01:10:47.929]  Honey, is this a joke?
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.061]  He's got a hook on his back.
[01:10:50.061 --> 01:10:52.963]  He's flying around being worshipped by leftists.
[01:10:52.963 --> 01:10:57.066]  And these weird leftists are always into weird, like, 1930s-style plays.
[01:10:57.066 --> 01:11:01.329]  And they act and behave like ventriloquist dolls.
[01:11:01.329 --> 01:11:03.911]  And then he's, like, shaking dogs' faces.
[01:11:03.911 --> 01:11:07.434]  And then he came to Texas and tried to talk in a Texas accent.
[01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:11.977]  And they have experts riding him, like, sir, if you talk like this, they'll think you're a Texan.
[01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:13.518]  And then this Mary Poppins crap?
[01:11:13.518 --> 01:11:15.440]  I mean, he may be a space alien!
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.706]  Look, this is all about unconscious marketing.
[01:11:19.706 --> 01:11:22.090]  You know what 4chan is, right?
[01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:26.717]  4chan is kind of a, you know, a collective of
[01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:36.699]  Young hacker minded malcontents who there's no censorship whatsoever.
[01:11:36.699 --> 01:11:38.441]  They came up with Pepe the Frog.
[01:11:38.441 --> 01:11:48.632]  Hillary Clinton was convinced that Pepe the Frog was a major enemy and represented Nazism and she started quoting Pepe the Frog and that was part of her
[01:11:48.792 --> 01:11:52.897]  And now they've got Grofus banned and the OK sign.
[01:11:52.897 --> 01:11:53.698]  4chan, stop it!
[01:11:53.698 --> 01:11:55.359]  They're going to ban the alphabet now!
[01:11:55.359 --> 01:11:58.703]  I think Mike Bloomberg is going to 4chan.
[01:11:58.703 --> 01:12:03.168]  He sees the wackiest memes over there and he says, well this is the way you get elected.
[01:12:03.168 --> 01:12:08.775]  You have to take the 4chan wackiest memes out there because somehow they hit everyone on a... But he doesn't get how to do it!
[01:12:09.315 --> 01:12:11.656]  He has advisors because he has a billion dollars.
[01:12:11.656 --> 01:12:14.957]  So he gets to the advisors and they get into a room and they say, how are we going to win this thing?
[01:12:14.957 --> 01:12:19.218]  And they say, well, we know that the American public is susceptible to 4chan memes.
[01:12:19.218 --> 01:12:24.800]  So let's go to 4chan, see what kind of memes they're generating about you, and use that as our campaign.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.361]  Because for some reason, that works.
[01:12:26.361 --> 01:12:35.064]  And meanwhile, on Facebook, Twitter, Google, they're banning anybody who's pro-Trump, saying you're not allowed to have memes, but then Bloomberg could duck hundreds of millions on them.
[01:12:35.064 --> 01:12:35.204]  Right.
[01:12:35.204 --> 01:12:36.184]  This is meme warfare.
[01:12:36.664 --> 01:12:43.532]  It looks crazy and psychotic, but it's attacking people on their unconscious level and softening them up as a form of meme torture.
[01:12:43.532 --> 01:12:47.417]  When they go into the voting booth, they feel like Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:12:47.417 --> 01:12:48.819]  They fall in love with their captor.
[01:12:48.819 --> 01:12:52.783]  They feel enslaved by these awful weaponized memes, and they end up voting for Mike Bloomberg.
[01:12:52.783 --> 01:12:54.265]  But see, it's not working because...
[01:12:55.006 --> 01:12:57.107]  I've been looking at these memes and they don't make sense.
[01:12:57.107 --> 01:12:58.408]  They're not supposed to make sense.
[01:12:58.408 --> 01:13:03.790]  They're supposed to disrupt your unconscious mind so that you feel enslaved to your master meme, the meme master.
[01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:06.211]  And it works, it worked against Hillary to some degree.
[01:13:06.211 --> 01:13:07.051]  She fell for it.
[01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:10.233]  She was tailor-made to fall into it.
[01:13:10.233 --> 01:13:12.394]  Because she was late to the party.
[01:13:12.394 --> 01:13:21.378]  Mike Bloomberg, because he's also a media savvy guy, he has Bloomberg as a media empire, he understands the power of memes, he understands the power of 4chan and 8chan and all the spinoffs of these things.
[01:13:21.819 --> 01:13:25.367]  That made me really like Trump more, actually.
[01:13:26.089 --> 01:13:31.393]  Well, the memes are powerful on the unconscious level, so you don't know how they're going to impact people's behavior.
[01:13:31.393 --> 01:13:36.577]  Mostly, it's very disruptive, and you are in a place where it's very topsy-turvy and what you thought.
[01:13:36.577 --> 01:13:37.958]  It's the same thing on the stock market.
[01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:47.425]  The worse the coronavirus gets, the better for the stock market, because the worse it gets, the more money printing we'll have from the central banks that goes right into the stock market.
[01:13:47.425 --> 01:13:50.347]  So, you actually want the coronavirus to be as deadly as possible.
[01:13:50.347 --> 01:13:51.989]  That's the whole thing, war is the health of the state.
[01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:55.071]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:55.071 --> 01:14:01.656]  It adds more free money to the top 2 or 3 percent that own most of the stocks.
[01:14:01.656 --> 01:14:08.942]  Who then fund socialist ideas to further consolidate control, but actually building a group of people that will tear them limb from limb.
[01:14:08.942 --> 01:14:11.464]  It's not socialism, it's neo-feudalism.
[01:14:11.464 --> 01:14:12.125]  Let me explain.
[01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.566]  Neo-feudalistic capitalism.
[01:14:14.086 --> 01:14:14.747]  Let me explain.
[01:14:14.747 --> 01:14:24.936]  So only when you have a wealth gap like we do now, it's really a feudalistic model where not just most of the wealth is in a few hands, it's all of the wealth.
[01:14:24.936 --> 01:14:26.817]  And we are essentially serfs.
[01:14:26.817 --> 01:14:30.621]  You know, you were used to peasant uprisings in places like Venezuela.
[01:14:30.621 --> 01:14:33.623]  There's like a peasant uprising in France called the Gilets Jaunes.
[01:14:33.623 --> 01:14:34.184]  In America,
[01:14:35.347 --> 01:14:43.022]  AOC and the Democrats and Bernie Sanders, this is a peasant uprising against an entrenched plutocracy.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:52.705]  Entrenched plutocracy is actually funding the old communist model as the resistance, knowing it's going to fail.
[01:14:52.705 --> 01:15:00.271]  When they're all posing as Black Lives Matter supporters, Jeff Bezos and people, they're actually funding Bernie and all.
[01:15:00.271 --> 01:15:10.999]  Sanders, what his strength would be is to recognize that this is a peasant revolt, and we in America that are being victimized by the opiate industry, the healthcare plutocrats, the banking cartel,
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.485]  It's drifting into neo-feudalism, and he should say, look, we are drifting into neo-feudalism.
[01:15:16.485 --> 01:15:21.390]  We are emerging as a peasant class, just like the peasant classes we've destroyed all over Latin America.
[01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:22.911]  They're getting rid of the middle class on purpose.
[01:15:22.911 --> 01:15:24.032]  Completely.
[01:15:24.032 --> 01:15:24.533]  Absolutely.
[01:15:24.533 --> 01:15:30.719]  They're getting a pliant underclass now that begs for the state for handouts, ending American individualism.
[01:15:30.719 --> 01:15:32.321]  Nobody wants to admit that they're a peasant.
[01:15:32.501 --> 01:15:37.703]  Certainly not 250 million Americans or 320 million Americans that want to admit they're a peasant.
[01:15:37.703 --> 01:15:41.644]  So they're susceptible to meme warfare because they're in denial about their own peasantry.
[01:15:41.644 --> 01:15:42.824]  MaxKaiser.com.
[01:15:42.824 --> 01:15:43.864]  Max, thanks for coming in.

[01:15:49.366 --> 01:15:51.467]  I'll be back in April, if not sooner.
[01:15:51.467 --> 01:15:53.267]  We're going to put you in a straitjacket.
[01:15:53.267 --> 01:15:53.767]  That's fine.
[01:15:53.767 --> 01:15:55.288]  I've been in straitjackets many times.
[01:15:56.223 --> 01:16:02.867]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[01:16:02.867 --> 01:16:13.473]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in the
[01:16:13.953 --> 01:16:23.278]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.

[01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:10.909]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of infowarsstore.com, where you find the 60 plus products.

[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.883]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[01:18:26.883 --> 01:18:27.803]  It's incredible.
[01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.465]  So do yourself a favor.

[01:18:46.719 --> 01:18:50.643]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it, word of mouth.
[01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:54.486]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO, instead of imploding.
[01:18:54.486 --> 01:18:56.388]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning.
[01:18:56.388 --> 01:18:56.809]  Thanks to you.
[01:19:07.017 --> 01:19:08.498]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[01:19:08.498 --> 01:19:10.219]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[01:19:10.219 --> 01:19:14.001]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[01:19:14.001 --> 01:19:17.863]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[01:19:17.863 --> 01:19:19.104]  20 different stickers.
[01:19:19.104 --> 01:19:20.725]  Impeach the Democrats.
[01:19:20.725 --> 01:19:21.805]  Save the Second Amendment.
[01:19:21.805 --> 01:19:22.886]  Defend the First Amendment.
[01:19:22.886 --> 01:19:24.227]  Infowars.com.
[01:19:24.227 --> 01:19:26.388]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[01:19:26.388 --> 01:19:31.211]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[01:19:31.211 --> 01:19:32.752]  People say, why are you doing this?
[01:19:32.752 --> 01:19:33.272]  What's happening?
[01:19:33.272 --> 01:19:36.794]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored, and Trump won't do anything about it.
[01:19:37.034 --> 01:19:40.215]  And Dr. Pichetnik, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[01:19:40.215 --> 01:19:41.196]  It's brilliant.
[01:19:41.196 --> 01:19:48.278]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[01:19:48.278 --> 01:19:51.220]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.041]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:59.763]  Silence.
[01:19:59.763 --> 01:20:02.424]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:22.310]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:28.777]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.777 --> 01:20:39.709]  Alright, it's always great to have Max Geiser in studio with us, but I think part of it is he does his international RT show that's very serious, and then he likes to blow off steam and have fun here on this show.
[01:20:41.327 --> 01:20:52.351]  But things are really, really serious, and on air and off air he was agreeing that this coronavirus long-term threatens the global economy, and it's certainly causing big shakeups in China.
[01:20:52.351 --> 01:21:03.816]  But I want to get Mike Adams on, because in the last month that we've been focused on the coronavirus, I have really tried to downplay how serious things could be, because I don't want to overplay it.
[01:21:03.816 --> 01:21:06.497]  But I got to tell you, the response we've seen has been over the top.
[01:21:07.588 --> 01:21:14.575]  The government saying everything's okay out of one side of their mouth, but massive preparations on the other side really concerns me.
[01:21:14.575 --> 01:21:18.920]  And now we're seeing that indeed they were covering up the real numbers of people that were sick.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:24.966]  And now we've got major scientific institutions and major medical institutions saying the reinfection is happening and
[01:21:26.755 --> 01:21:30.997]  People get even sicker in the reinfection because it looks like it's mutated.
[01:21:30.997 --> 01:21:32.978]  So something big's going on here.
[01:21:32.978 --> 01:21:40.981]  Absolutely, Xi Jinping is using this to clamp down on political dissidents and move into Taiwan, where their takeover's been unpopular.
[01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:42.622]  But there's something else going on.
[01:21:42.622 --> 01:21:43.962]  We know it's man-made.
[01:21:43.962 --> 01:21:45.663]  We know they've been covering up the origin of that.
[01:21:45.663 --> 01:21:49.045]  Now Mainline News is saying it's man-made.
[01:21:49.045 --> 01:21:53.366]  So we've really been the cutting edge here with Mike Adams and other guests that we've had on the broadcast.
[01:21:55.472 --> 01:22:01.556]  Coronavirus cases spike 30% first death reported in Europe.
[01:22:01.556 --> 01:22:09.120]  Doctors warn of even deadlier coronavirus reinfection causing sudden heart attacks.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:14.484]  Leading medical journal reports coronavirus highly contagious and more deadly than initially estimated.
[01:22:14.484 --> 01:22:19.527]  Bill Gates warns 10 million lives at risk as virus spreads to Africa and Taiwan reports first death.
[01:22:20.768 --> 01:22:23.230]  China now censoring coronavirus critics in the U.S.
[01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.791]  We'll get more to that in a moment.
[01:22:24.791 --> 01:22:31.836]  China's disintegrating steel demand, property sales, traffic, all approaching zero.
[01:22:31.836 --> 01:22:35.778]  I mean, if it is a hoax, it's the biggest hoax in history, but it is contagious.
[01:22:35.778 --> 01:22:39.501]  It is killing people, but I mean, are they over responding?
[01:22:41.442 --> 01:22:44.303]  Coronavirus could infect 60% of global population if unchecked.
[01:22:44.303 --> 01:22:45.824]  That's the London Guardian.
[01:22:45.824 --> 01:22:49.305]  Xi's early involvement in virus outbreak raises questions.
[01:22:49.305 --> 01:22:55.068]  To tame coronavirus, Mao-style social control blankets China.
[01:22:55.068 --> 01:22:57.829]  Did coronavirus originate in Chinese government laboratories?
[01:22:57.829 --> 01:22:59.689]  See, that's now in Reuters.
[01:22:59.689 --> 01:23:00.590]  It's now in the Daily Mail.
[01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:03.191]  It's now in the German news.
[01:23:03.191 --> 01:23:04.051]  No handshakes!
[01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:06.332]  Viral outbreaks spook Asians.
[01:23:06.332 --> 01:23:07.893]  Places of worship.
[01:23:07.893 --> 01:23:07.973]  AP.
[01:23:09.582 --> 01:23:16.164]  Pets in China forced to wear bizarre makeshift masks made by owners amid fears they may catch deadly coronavirus.
[01:23:16.164 --> 01:23:22.165]  And there's just all taped up animals faces looking completely dystopic.
[01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:24.566]  Mass hysteria?
[01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:30.187]  A hunt for clues in Hawaii after tourist couple falls ill with coronavirus.
[01:23:30.187 --> 01:23:33.188]  China desperate to stop coronavirus spread turns neighbor against neighbor.
[01:23:34.156 --> 01:23:37.217]  Avoid crowds, over virus, Japan Health Minister warns.
[01:23:37.217 --> 01:23:40.699]  I mean, I gotta go to Mike Adams and stop just reading all these headlines.
[01:23:40.699 --> 01:23:44.961]  Everything Mike said two, three weeks ago has now come true, okay?
[01:23:44.961 --> 01:23:51.064]  And we've been laying this out, so it's obviously big, but what is it?
[01:23:51.064 --> 01:23:52.004]  What's behind it?
[01:23:52.004 --> 01:23:53.125]  How bad is it gonna get?
[01:23:53.125 --> 01:23:54.545]  Mike Adams, what's the latest?
[01:23:54.545 --> 01:23:55.866]  Tell us tomorrow's news today.
[01:23:57.051 --> 01:23:58.492]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:23:58.492 --> 01:24:01.776]  I really appreciate your segments with Max Keiser there.
[01:24:01.776 --> 01:24:08.722]  I apologize, I can't bring that level of levity to this because, you know, I've just been diving into the coronavirus.
[01:24:08.722 --> 01:24:14.108]  But I'm glad, you know, I'm really glad that we can have a little humor today because it's about to get really dark.
[01:24:14.628 --> 01:24:15.629]  For America.
[01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:33.969]  So, number one, first of all, in the last week, the CDC top person, the head of the CDC, Dr. Redfield, admitted that this was coming to America in the form of community outbreaks and that it would return essentially year after year, kind of like the way the seasonal flu keeps coming back, mutated.
[01:24:34.389 --> 01:24:43.973]  So you have the head of the CDC admitting that this is going to become endemic in the human population and it's only a matter of time before it goes across America.
[01:24:43.973 --> 01:24:49.415]  The CDC right now... I forgot you said that on Friday and you wrote about it on naturalnews.com but that's so huge!
[01:24:49.415 --> 01:24:55.858]  There's a whole new class of virus that's clearly made in the laboratory that they tell us is this whole new thing we've got to just deal with now.
[01:24:57.252 --> 01:24:57.773]  Absolutely.
[01:24:57.773 --> 01:25:02.418]  And as you just mentioned, the reinfection of this is more fatal than the initial infection.
[01:25:02.418 --> 01:25:08.224]  Because what happens is during the initial infection, your body is slow to respond, slow to build the antibodies.
[01:25:08.224 --> 01:25:11.848]  If you survive that, and currently we believe that maybe 83, 85 out of 100 people survive that first infection,
[01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:20.253]  If you get re-infected, what happens is your body over-responds with what's called a cytokine storm.
[01:25:20.253 --> 01:25:27.456]  And that, combined with the initial scarring of your lungs from the first infection, is causing sudden heart failure.
[01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:31.618]  And Alex, this, I believe, is what's behind those videos of people dropping dead on the streets.
[01:25:31.618 --> 01:25:34.559]  You know, where they die in 60 seconds and then just collapse.
[01:25:34.559 --> 01:25:35.960]  It's the second infection.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:43.327]  It's the same virus, it's just that your body responds differently and you have sudden, extreme heart failure and you're dead.
[01:25:43.327 --> 01:25:44.408]  You cannot be revived.
[01:25:44.408 --> 01:25:45.349]  It's over.
[01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:48.873]  So, remember, I don't know if you've read reports about the Spanish Flu in 1918.
[01:25:48.873 --> 01:25:53.998]  It wasn't the first wave that killed the, what, 50 million people around the world.
[01:25:53.998 --> 01:25:55.019]  It was the second wave.
[01:25:55.689 --> 01:26:03.611]  So even if we are lucky enough to survive the first wave of this, the second wave of infection could be even more devastating than the first.
[01:26:03.611 --> 01:26:05.812]  And by the way, I'm starting to get hints.
[01:26:05.812 --> 01:26:06.732]  I want to be careful.
[01:26:06.732 --> 01:26:14.474]  This is not confirmed yet, but we're seeing in the Asian media, we're seeing a lot of mentions of people who have been traveling to and from Hawaii.
[01:26:15.374 --> 01:26:19.896]  Later getting diagnosed in countries like Japan and Taiwan and Malaysia and so on.
[01:26:19.896 --> 01:26:23.518]  There seems to be some kind of link to Hawaii right now.
[01:26:23.518 --> 01:26:24.498]  Again, it's not confirmed.
[01:26:24.498 --> 01:26:25.839]  We're not aware of any outbreaks there.
[01:26:25.839 --> 01:26:35.303]  But if you think about the number of Asian people who visit Hawaii for tourism or business, you know, the large Japanese American communities in Hawaii and so on.
[01:26:36.252 --> 01:26:42.759]  Then you begin to understand Hawaii makes sense as the first geographical place for this to really have sustained outbreaks in America.
[01:26:42.759 --> 01:26:47.364]  We hope it doesn't happen, but the evidence is sort of pointing in that direction.
[01:26:47.364 --> 01:26:50.047]  At the same time, right now in China,
[01:26:51.051 --> 01:26:53.374]  So many people are under quarantine or lockdown.
[01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:58.240]  It's now double the population of the entire United States of America.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:01.224]  760 million people under lockdown in China.
[01:27:01.224 --> 01:27:07.591]  And they're now starting to offer rewards if you narc on your feverish neighbor.
[01:27:08.232 --> 01:27:21.635]  So now this is full-blown communism, Alex, where it's like, here, we're going to pay you money, the state is going to pay you money to turn in your neighbor who has a fever or who's coughing or who just came from Wuhan and didn't tell anybody.
[01:27:21.635 --> 01:27:29.237]  So now we have this secret police culture where they're turning people against each other all across China.
[01:27:29.237 --> 01:27:30.938]  And on top of that, you want me to keep going?
[01:27:30.938 --> 01:27:31.378]  I've got more.
[01:27:32.882 --> 01:27:34.684]  Yes, you've got the floor here.
[01:27:34.684 --> 01:27:37.106]  Clearly, there's something big behind this.
[01:27:37.106 --> 01:27:41.530]  And you're right, they're using it as a clamp down, but there are people for real just dropping dead.
[01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:49.757]  And that's what these reports, you talked about this two weeks ago, but now major medical institutions are saying that's what's causing his total cardiac arrest.
[01:27:49.757 --> 01:27:56.863]  So a piece I put together, by the way, I just published 15 minutes ago a new piece that talks about how the coronavirus could alter the outcome of the 2020 election.
[01:27:58.590 --> 01:28:00.410]  We should probably get into that.
[01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:01.331]  Maybe you want to repost.
[01:28:01.331 --> 01:28:01.771]  It's up to you.
[01:28:01.771 --> 01:28:15.114]  But the Democrat cities, they rely on public transportation where you share common surfaces in subways and taxis and rail trains and, you know, public transportation, buses.
[01:28:15.114 --> 01:28:18.075]  Well, the coronavirus survives up to nine days on a surface.
[01:28:18.075 --> 01:28:18.435]  Viable.
[01:28:19.272 --> 01:28:29.437]  And also, in liberal cities, you have sanctuary status, which means that once this gets into Mexico or other South American or Central American nations, you have people fleeing those nations who are infected.
[01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:31.458]  They're trying to run away from the pandemic.
[01:28:31.458 --> 01:28:32.539]  They're going to cross the U.S.
[01:28:32.539 --> 01:28:40.403]  border, and they're going to be drawn like magnets to the sanctuary cities, like San Francisco, where we already have a feces problem there.
[01:28:40.403 --> 01:28:44.205]  We now have scientists confirming that this coronavirus spreads through human feces.
[01:28:44.906 --> 01:28:49.956]  Another confirmed case in Hong Kong where it was spread through the sewage lines in an apartment building.
[01:28:49.956 --> 01:28:50.357]  Stay there.
[01:28:50.357 --> 01:28:54.205]  Let's start over then because that's really the big news that this could affect the 2020.
[01:28:57.967 --> 01:29:06.413]  Three weeks ago, we told you the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers for the coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told.
[01:29:06.413 --> 01:29:08.395]  Now we know that that is the case.
[01:29:08.395 --> 01:29:14.619]  And we know the federal government and major corporations have been buying up all the major storable food supplies around the country.
[01:29:14.619 --> 01:29:16.441]  Almost everyone else is sold out.
[01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:21.905]  But our supplier, MyPatriot, InfowarsStore.com, still has their entire line
[01:29:22.325 --> 01:29:23.866]  High-quality, fresh food.
[01:29:23.866 --> 01:29:24.986]  And it's fresh.
[01:29:24.986 --> 01:29:27.708]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered.
[01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:33.491]  Not because they don't have the food, but because they've got to package it, and their factories are going 24 hours a day.
[01:29:33.491 --> 01:29:34.972]  High-quality, fresh food.
[01:29:34.972 --> 01:29:36.352]  The best package systems.
[01:29:36.352 --> 01:29:37.113]  Tastes great.
[01:29:37.113 --> 01:29:38.353]  Protects you and your family.
[01:29:38.353 --> 01:29:39.694]  And funds the InfoWar.
[01:29:39.694 --> 01:29:44.417]  You've just got to get the orders in until they extend it out even more, which could happen.
[01:29:44.417 --> 01:29:45.757]  Lock in your orders now.
[01:29:45.757 --> 01:29:48.559]  Ensure you get it at InfoWarStore.com today.
[01:29:49.139 --> 01:29:53.068]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:29:59.485 --> 01:30:09.931]  Cobra Commander here reminding you to not own firearms, to not take supplements, to not get sunshine, and to not love Jesus.
[01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:18.435]  And of course, do not get storable foods or any other types of colloidal nano-silver at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:30:18.435 --> 01:30:20.316]  Do not do it.
[01:30:20.316 --> 01:30:25.519]  Trust CNN, trust MSNBC, drink fluoridated water,
[01:30:26.039 --> 01:30:35.021]  Just like the loving kiss of a king cobra, pumping deadly, I mean loving, healthful nutrients into your body.
[01:30:35.021 --> 01:30:36.801]  Hug the cobra.
[01:30:36.801 --> 01:30:38.561]  Love the cobra.
[01:30:38.561 --> 01:30:40.082]  Kiss the cobra.
[01:30:40.082 --> 01:30:47.823]  But never, never go to InfoWars.com or InfoWarsStore.com!
[01:30:47.823 --> 01:30:50.724]  Do not order those products!
[01:30:50.724 --> 01:30:52.284]  Silence Jones!
[01:30:57.190 --> 01:30:58.370]  Don't be a victim.
[01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:03.232]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your immune system.
[01:31:03.232 --> 01:31:07.493]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down, but you have plenty of hydration.
[01:31:07.493 --> 01:31:09.894]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[01:31:09.894 --> 01:31:13.355]  Get plenty of vitamin C. Get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[01:31:13.355 --> 01:31:15.036]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:18.657]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[01:31:18.657 --> 01:31:22.878]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver that's
[01:31:22.998 --> 01:31:28.482]  Patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown that go after this whole Corona SARS family of viruses.
[01:31:28.482 --> 01:31:31.044]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles.
[01:31:31.044 --> 01:31:35.608]  That'll be sold out a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[01:31:35.608 --> 01:31:36.789]  Great to have, period.
[01:31:36.789 --> 01:31:38.350]  Really good for your gums, really great for your
[01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:41.453]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[01:31:41.453 --> 01:31:46.477]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[01:31:46.477 --> 01:31:49.860]  It's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything because we get the best stuff.
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:51.101]  There's a lot of patriots.
[01:31:51.101 --> 01:31:52.702]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[01:31:52.702 --> 01:31:55.685]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals.
[01:31:55.685 --> 01:31:56.426]  It's very exciting.
[01:31:58.089 --> 01:32:02.792]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:32:59.803 --> 01:33:02.465]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:26.978 --> 01:33:34.100]  All right, Mike Adams is our guest here at Natural News.
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.762]  He's been on target like nobody else really breaking all this down.
[01:33:38.922 --> 01:33:43.884]  It's been in the medical journals, it's been out there, but they've been really suppressing those and making people cover it up.
[01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:46.184]  But now more and more scientists, more and more people in the U.S.
[01:33:46.184 --> 01:33:49.405]  government are coming out and saying, no, it is man-made.
[01:33:49.405 --> 01:33:57.448]  And it's a whole new class of viruses that they say is like the flu that'll just be mutating and bouncing around forever.
[01:33:57.448 --> 01:34:00.469]  So who knows how it really mutates later?
[01:34:00.469 --> 01:34:03.590]  Who knows what they've already done with this virus in the laboratory?
[01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:07.071]  And now we're going to see it unfold for years.
[01:34:08.188 --> 01:34:10.710]  We have the headline, it's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:11.510]  Hope people will share it.
[01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:14.512]  It's also at NaturalNews.com where Mike first published it.
[01:34:14.512 --> 01:34:20.637]  Could the coronavirus pandemic drastically alter the 2020 elections?
[01:34:20.637 --> 01:34:29.523]  Democrat cities are the most likely outbreak hubs because of the rats, the feces, the needles, just the overall mental illness and filthiness everywhere.
[01:34:29.523 --> 01:34:35.847]  And they're giant destinations for people pouring out of the third world with all sorts of other diseases that also lower the immune system.
[01:34:35.847 --> 01:34:36.908]  Mike, lay it out for them.
[01:34:38.243 --> 01:34:40.245]  Well, there are really two big risks.
[01:34:40.245 --> 01:34:44.549]  One set of risks works against the Democrats and the other against Trump.
[01:34:44.549 --> 01:34:50.695]  First, in terms of infections, the Democrat cities are the high-density areas that are most likely to spread these diseases.
[01:34:50.695 --> 01:34:59.784]  They have homelessness problems in places like Seattle, shared needles, filthy streets, feces running in the streets of San Francisco, bad public health policies.
[01:34:59.784 --> 01:35:01.546]  It's a disaster in many of these liberal cities.
[01:35:02.186 --> 01:35:04.908]  On top of that, again, you have shared public transportation.
[01:35:04.908 --> 01:35:06.929]  People don't typically own their own private cars.
[01:35:06.929 --> 01:35:08.850]  They share transportation.
[01:35:08.850 --> 01:35:12.553]  And these are sanctuary cities where infected migrants are likely to go to.
[01:35:12.553 --> 01:35:18.836]  On the other side of this, if there is an economic impact from this outbreak, then that's going to hurt Trump.
[01:35:18.836 --> 01:35:28.082]  Because as I said in the story, I believe that President Trump has foolishly tied himself to one number in America, and that's the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which
[01:35:28.846 --> 01:35:30.287]  By itself, it's very one-dimensional.
[01:35:30.287 --> 01:35:33.608]  It doesn't really cover the full economy, what's really happening.
[01:35:33.608 --> 01:35:35.508]  I mean, there's a lot of good news in America.
[01:35:35.508 --> 01:35:39.210]  Unemployment rate has plummeted, especially among minority groups.
[01:35:39.210 --> 01:35:41.591]  But the stock market is a bubble.
[01:35:41.591 --> 01:35:43.231]  It is going to correct at some point.
[01:35:43.231 --> 01:35:53.895]  If this pandemic accelerates that correction, then that will be used to hammer Trump, and people might start to lose faith in the Trump administration if he can't keep that stock market sky-high all the way through November.
[01:35:54.475 --> 01:35:56.257]  So, maybe these are a wash.
[01:35:56.257 --> 01:35:57.918]  Maybe these risks balance each other out.
[01:35:57.918 --> 01:36:07.045]  It's hard to say, but I think we have to be asking right now, and you know, here on your show, this is the first time we're talking about it publicly on any broadcast, how will this impact the election?
[01:36:07.045 --> 01:36:12.229]  And there were 26 Democrat senators who wrote a letter to President Trump, an urgent letter, I think just two days ago.
[01:36:13.306 --> 01:36:16.367]  Saying that they need more funding to combat this virus?
[01:36:16.367 --> 01:36:22.370]  So far, President Trump has really not done much about this, and I think he needs to get out in front of this very quickly.
[01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:26.411]  He has ordered the research, as you know, to find out if this was genetically engineered.
[01:36:26.411 --> 01:36:27.912]  We already know that's the case.
[01:36:27.912 --> 01:36:30.373]  We don't know if the government's going to cover that up.
[01:36:30.373 --> 01:36:31.774]  At least Trump is doing something.
[01:36:31.774 --> 01:36:37.316]  But he needs to get out in front of this and say to the American people, it's not a bad idea to get prepared.
[01:36:37.316 --> 01:36:42.078]  It's not a bad idea to think about maybe you have to keep your kids home from school if there's an outbreak in your community.
[01:36:42.618 --> 01:36:44.521]  You know, but so far he's not doing any of that.
[01:36:44.521 --> 01:36:46.123]  I think he doesn't want to cause panic.
[01:36:46.123 --> 01:36:48.767]  So we're still far away from the election.
[01:36:48.767 --> 01:36:51.110]  We're going to see how this plays out.
[01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:56.277]  By the way, 355 people now confirmed infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
[01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:57.379]  Now think about this.
[01:36:58.089 --> 01:37:02.372]  They're getting infected because they're sharing the same air on that ship.
[01:37:02.372 --> 01:37:04.813]  It's not a level four biohazard quarantine center.
[01:37:04.813 --> 01:37:08.155]  It's a floating clinic now, basically.
[01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:09.416]  People keep getting infected.
[01:37:09.416 --> 01:37:10.977]  And here's a problem, Alex.
[01:37:10.977 --> 01:37:16.400]  They're going to release people from that quarantine on February 19th in three days.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.703]  They're going to release people who do not yet show signs.
[01:37:20.703 --> 01:37:24.425]  Well, what if that person got infected today or tomorrow?
[01:37:24.425 --> 01:37:27.587]  They would only be in day two or day three of the incubation period.
[01:37:28.197 --> 01:37:32.859]  They would have full-blown symptoms maybe two weeks later, but they're going to be released on February 19th.
[01:37:32.859 --> 01:37:42.784]  Some of them are Americans, and they're choosing to fly back on commercial airlines in first-class seats rather than take the evacuation flights that are currently being chartered by the United States government.
[01:37:43.314 --> 01:37:52.504]  The evacuation participants will suffer another quarantine in the United States 14 more days after they come back, at least according to early reports.
[01:37:52.504 --> 01:37:56.989]  But these other people who are released on February 19th, they will have no quarantine.
[01:37:56.989 --> 01:37:59.132]  They will be able to fly commercially and come back to U.S.
[01:37:59.132 --> 01:38:01.194]  airports and go back to their homes in U.S.
[01:38:01.194 --> 01:38:04.538]  cities all across the country with no monitoring.
[01:38:05.163 --> 01:38:06.744]  Until they start to show symptoms.
[01:38:06.744 --> 01:38:08.285]  So I think this is a critical mistake.
[01:38:08.285 --> 01:38:09.886]  This is how these things happen.
[01:38:09.886 --> 01:38:10.827]  Bad mistakes.
[01:38:10.827 --> 01:38:12.928]  The CDC has already screwed up once.
[01:38:12.928 --> 01:38:18.352]  They sent a quarantine person home, accidentally realized that they should have been back in the quarantine center.
[01:38:18.352 --> 01:38:19.313]  There was a lab mix-up.
[01:38:19.313 --> 01:38:21.675]  You know, you covered that, I think, earlier in the week.
[01:38:21.675 --> 01:38:23.336]  And then they had to come back into the quarantine.
[01:38:23.336 --> 01:38:33.603]  So we're starting to see mistakes being made, not even to cover deliberate cover-ups that may be taking place, but just mistakes will cause this to spread everywhere.
[01:38:34.755 --> 01:38:35.777]  Just jump in whenever you want.
[01:38:35.777 --> 01:38:37.000]  I'm going to keep going until you do.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.283]  Oh no, Mike, that's why you're here.
[01:38:38.283 --> 01:38:40.267]  I want you to lay all this out.
[01:38:40.267 --> 01:38:42.934]  Nobody's laying out more comprehensive, more accurate information.
[01:38:42.934 --> 01:38:43.575]  We're blessed to have you.
[01:38:44.963 --> 01:38:52.290]  Well, look, I'm honored to be here, and Bill Gates now says 10 million people could be killed in Africa alone.
[01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:59.437]  Of course, a lot of people are going to find that ironic, given the depopulation agenda of Bill Gates and so on, but he's talking about just Africa.
[01:38:59.437 --> 01:39:08.566]  Now, Ethiopia Airlines is continuing to take flights directly from China, because they take money from China, they don't want to insult China, so they haven't cut off the flights.
[01:39:09.534 --> 01:39:14.198]  Ethiopia and other African nations, I mean in Egypt now we have a confirmed case.
[01:39:14.198 --> 01:39:20.582]  Many of these nations are not in any way equipped to deal with this outbreak and they will simply just refuse to test for it.
[01:39:20.582 --> 01:39:22.764]  That way they don't have to report any numbers.
[01:39:22.764 --> 01:39:27.007]  An outbreak in Africa, Bill Gates, he's saying it could kill 10 million people.
[01:39:27.007 --> 01:39:29.749]  He knows the real number is more like 100 million.
[01:39:29.749 --> 01:39:30.810]  He's being very conservative.
[01:39:31.443 --> 01:39:35.084]  This could be a real wipeout of millions of people.
[01:39:35.084 --> 01:39:37.385]  Tens of millions of people across the world and Africa.
[01:39:37.385 --> 01:39:40.186]  Something big is going on.
[01:39:40.186 --> 01:39:41.626]  And yes, I'm selling terrible food.
[01:39:41.626 --> 01:39:42.406]  I always am.
[01:39:42.406 --> 01:39:43.367]  It's the highest quality.
[01:39:43.367 --> 01:39:44.267]  It's the best.
[01:39:44.267 --> 01:39:45.287]  We've still got it on hand.
[01:39:45.287 --> 01:39:46.668]  Others don't.
[01:39:46.668 --> 01:39:53.250]  But we know the other big suppliers really are sold out.
[01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:57.891]  We know they're selling out to FEMA and the federal government.
[01:39:57.891 --> 01:39:58.311]  We know that.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:07.104]  That's why I'm so concerned is we're seeing real governmental action behind the scenes.
[01:40:07.104 --> 01:40:21.212]  So what we're seeing from our commercial suppliers, in very fascinating conversations, is that all the commercial buyers are now rejecting supplies from China, which means they're now starting to source food supplies from other non-China sources, which are being really wiped out very quickly.
[01:40:21.212 --> 01:40:26.856]  As an example, just two days ago, we purchased the last 5,000 pounds of organic millet.
[01:40:27.532 --> 01:40:28.973]  That's available in North America.
[01:40:28.973 --> 01:40:31.014]  We were told by our supplier, that's it.
[01:40:31.014 --> 01:40:34.916]  No more millet until the next season because now everybody's shifting away from China.
[01:40:34.916 --> 01:40:44.921]  So we have this massive movement in the food industry, which is why it's great that your suppliers have supplies locked up, probably contractually locked up, you know, for many, many months.
[01:40:44.921 --> 01:40:46.362]  They can still supply food.
[01:40:46.362 --> 01:40:47.483]  Most people cannot.
[01:40:47.483 --> 01:40:48.823]  That's starting to run out too, though.
[01:40:48.823 --> 01:40:50.424]  That's what scary is.
[01:40:50.424 --> 01:40:53.846]  Food sales aren't going down after a month of panic buying.
[01:40:53.846 --> 01:40:55.587]  They're actually going up now again.
[01:40:56.007 --> 01:41:01.652]  To record levels, and that's because institutions, corporations, and government are buying everything up.
[01:41:01.652 --> 01:41:04.614]  My patriarch isn't selling out the government.
[01:41:04.614 --> 01:41:05.835]  That's their policy.
[01:41:05.835 --> 01:41:10.579]  But we've seen massive buying by government agencies and others.
[01:41:10.579 --> 01:41:12.801]  That means they believe something big is coming.
[01:41:12.801 --> 01:41:13.962]  I hope that's not the case.
[01:41:13.962 --> 01:41:14.983]  I hope it's just a backup.
[01:41:14.983 --> 01:41:20.387]  But again, Mike, the insane response that you have seen
[01:41:21.516 --> 01:41:23.378]  To this by China.
[01:41:23.378 --> 01:41:25.940]  Is it just a power grab by Xi Jinping?
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:27.241]  What's the real death numbers?
[01:41:27.241 --> 01:41:29.783]  What's the real projections now?
[01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:36.889]  Well, according to my estimates, just based on analysis, there are at least now 250,000 people infected and probably over 25,000 deaths.
[01:41:36.889 --> 01:41:38.591]  Those might be off by a factor of 10.
[01:41:38.591 --> 01:41:39.632]  It might be 10 times higher.
[01:41:39.632 --> 01:41:40.873]  We just don't know yet.
[01:41:40.873 --> 01:41:49.160]  But look, the real play here is that China now wants to export these infections to other countries so that China doesn't get the blame for the global pandemic that's coming.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:58.802]  I have no question, no doubt, China is trying to export infections to Taiwan, to Hawaii, to Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, so that China doesn't get the blame.
[01:41:58.802 --> 01:42:07.544]  They already convinced the WHO to change the name of the virus away from the Wuhan pneumonia coronavirus to COVID-19, which doesn't have the word China in it, by the way.
[01:42:07.544 --> 01:42:08.845]  They're trying to rewrite history.
[01:42:08.845 --> 01:42:10.625]  They're trying to blame America.
[01:42:10.625 --> 01:42:15.086]  If they can cause an outbreak in America, they can say, look, even the CDC couldn't control this.
[01:42:15.086 --> 01:42:17.507]  How could you expect us in China to control it?
[01:42:18.107 --> 01:42:21.369]  This is getting to a very dangerous biological weapons stage.
[01:42:21.369 --> 01:42:28.272]  China already put a Chinese citizen that was infected on a Taiwan evacuation flight to try to sneak that person into Taiwan.
[01:42:28.272 --> 01:42:32.074]  And by the way, Mike, we were skeptics of China's official story going back a month ago.
[01:42:32.074 --> 01:42:32.614]  We were attacked.
[01:42:32.614 --> 01:42:33.014]  That's right.
[01:42:33.254 --> 01:42:37.979]  They called for us to be censored even more off the internet because we dared question the official story.
[01:42:37.979 --> 01:42:40.322]  Now it turns out we were right yet again.
[01:42:40.322 --> 01:42:45.707]  Which is why it's so important to keep InfoWars and Natural News on the air and why the listeners are so amazing.

[01:43:55.984 --> 01:44:02.630]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election, and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[01:44:02.630 --> 01:44:13.200]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in the
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:23.043]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[01:44:23.043 --> 01:44:28.725]  That's why it's so critical to go to InfoWareStore.com and stock up on high-quality preparedness items.

[01:44:36.167 --> 01:44:38.628]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:44:38.628 --> 01:44:39.708]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[01:44:39.708 --> 01:44:40.729]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:42.109]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:09.359]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:45:09.359 --> 01:45:11.242]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:45:11.242 --> 01:45:12.544]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:45:12.544 --> 01:45:13.265]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:45:14.281 --> 01:45:15.761]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:45:15.761 --> 01:45:18.462]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[01:45:18.462 --> 01:45:19.603]  I don't want them to win.
[01:45:19.603 --> 01:45:22.524]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.

[01:45:56.781 --> 01:46:00.822]  Almost all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food.
[01:46:00.822 --> 01:46:03.883]  But I know for a fact from sources to tell them people, oh, we've got it.
[01:46:03.883 --> 01:46:06.323]  Get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[01:46:06.323 --> 01:46:08.163]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[01:46:08.163 --> 01:46:09.844]  I've been on radio for 25 years.
[01:46:09.844 --> 01:46:12.004]  I've had storable food for a long time.
[01:46:12.004 --> 01:46:19.466]  And I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times, but during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory.
[01:46:19.466 --> 01:46:20.446]  They'll still take your orders.
[01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:35.713]  That's why about 11 years ago I found MyPatriotSupply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them, because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're going to say they're going to do, because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're good people.
[01:46:35.713 --> 01:46:40.596]  Now, they were saying 7 to 10 days before shipping, because they've got the food, but they've got to package it, record level orders.
[01:46:40.916 --> 01:46:45.659]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[01:46:45.659 --> 01:46:47.640]  So get your orders in at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:48.661]  Get the best deals.
[01:46:48.661 --> 01:46:49.761]  Get it delivered first.
[01:46:49.761 --> 01:46:50.582]  They're in our system.
[01:46:50.582 --> 01:46:51.603]  It goes right to them.
[01:46:51.603 --> 01:46:52.983]  Then it funds the Infor as well.
[01:46:52.983 --> 01:46:53.724]  So get prepared.
[01:46:53.724 --> 01:46:59.307]  InfoWarsaw.com with Sorible Foods.
[01:46:59.307 --> 01:47:01.929]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.451 --> 01:47:24.553]  We know there's a depopulation agenda.
[01:47:24.553 --> 01:47:35.560]  We know that they are developing deadly biological weapons under the guise of bioweapons protection all over the world.
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:38.382]  And we know this virus is man-made.
[01:47:38.382 --> 01:47:45.226]  It's got the injection points where it leaves the signature of exactly what was done and how it was done.
[01:47:46.289 --> 01:47:50.595]  And you'd think of, again, somebody's had open heart surgery, you see a big scar.
[01:47:50.595 --> 01:47:55.060]  And they can x-ray it and see where the chest was cut open and where it was stapled back together.
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:57.163]  Or you can see a woman that's had breast implants.
[01:47:57.163 --> 01:48:00.347]  They either went in, you know, through the front or they go in under the bottom.
[01:48:00.347 --> 01:48:02.229]  You know she's had breast implants.
[01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:04.692]  Well, when stuff's microscopic, it's even easier to see!
[01:48:05.333 --> 01:48:10.857]  Because it's so little and you're trying to inject something into it, it's got a big old smashed inside.
[01:48:10.857 --> 01:48:16.441]  And it's got the RNA sleeves still touching it.
[01:48:18.789 --> 01:48:20.971]  So it's fake.
[01:48:20.971 --> 01:48:22.472]  It's been manipulated.
[01:48:22.472 --> 01:48:26.734]  And they're introducing it to us, I think, as the new global fear every year.
[01:48:26.734 --> 01:48:28.055]  And it's going to mutate and get worse.
[01:48:28.055 --> 01:48:32.058]  We already know it is, with reinfection and causing heart attacks.
[01:48:32.058 --> 01:48:35.040]  And so the flu doesn't scare us enough to take the vaccines.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.362]  This is a man-made weapon to make us take vaccines.
[01:48:38.433 --> 01:48:39.113]  I've studied it.
[01:48:39.113 --> 01:48:41.094]  I've looked at it at every angle.
[01:48:41.094 --> 01:48:46.215]  Mike's held back a lot and says, well, clearly it's released and they're using it as a power grab.
[01:48:46.215 --> 01:48:47.315]  But it looks like it escaped.
[01:48:47.315 --> 01:48:47.795]  You know what?
[01:48:47.795 --> 01:48:48.895]  I don't think it escaped.
[01:48:48.895 --> 01:48:50.216]  I think they released it.
[01:48:50.216 --> 01:48:51.376]  Now that's speculation.
[01:48:51.376 --> 01:48:53.256]  I'm not saying Mike's wrong.
[01:48:53.256 --> 01:48:59.218]  Either way, you've got all these governments agreeing with each other and they're getting the vaccine, but oh, you got to wait 18 months.
[01:48:59.218 --> 01:49:02.219]  Oh, oh, they're going to hurry it up and have it next year.
[01:49:02.219 --> 01:49:03.539]  This is bad.
[01:49:03.539 --> 01:49:05.779]  And it pisses me off.
[01:49:05.779 --> 01:49:07.120]  And that's where I stand on this.
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:07.980]  Mike Adams, what do you think?
[01:49:08.723 --> 01:49:09.864]  I agree with you now.
[01:49:09.864 --> 01:49:11.924]  My assessment has changed in the last week.
[01:49:11.924 --> 01:49:14.726]  I believe this was also a deliberate release.
[01:49:14.726 --> 01:49:17.827]  So that's interesting that you just said that.
[01:49:17.827 --> 01:49:24.610]  I believe that it was introduced possibly by an agent working in that virology lab in Wuhan, but it was... Oh yeah, I forgot!
[01:49:24.610 --> 01:49:28.572]  Now the scientist who reportedly stole it from Canada is dead!
[01:49:28.572 --> 01:49:28.992]  Yeah.
[01:49:28.992 --> 01:49:30.452]  And a bunch of other people are getting killed.
[01:49:30.452 --> 01:49:31.813]  I'm sorry, there's just so many angles here.
[01:49:32.648 --> 01:49:33.169]  No, exactly.
[01:49:33.169 --> 01:49:37.092]  Well, look, this achieves all of the top goals of the globalists.
[01:49:37.092 --> 01:49:38.033]  Think about this.
[01:49:38.033 --> 01:49:39.895]  I don't think anybody's put all these pieces together.
[01:49:39.895 --> 01:49:45.520]  It's not just depopulation, but every government in the world is about to go broke from debt spending.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.102]  They need a scapegoat.
[01:49:47.102 --> 01:49:56.731]  Sure would be great to blame a virus for the economic collapse that's about to happen everywhere because of the global debt pyramid that Max Keiser was just talking about an hour ago, by the way, and he's correct on all that.
[01:49:57.291 --> 01:49:58.833]  Also, think about this.
[01:49:58.833 --> 01:50:00.074]  What's driving governments broke?
[01:50:00.074 --> 01:50:08.623]  Entitlement programs to retired people who no longer pay taxes but have huge costs to the governments in terms of Medicare, Social Security, pensions.
[01:50:08.623 --> 01:50:17.292]  If they could come up with a way to kill off mostly elderly people, wow, that would sure save governments of the world, including America, Canada, the UK, China, everywhere.
[01:50:17.873 --> 01:50:21.894]  Billions, I mean hundreds, maybe trillions of dollars over a few years.
[01:50:21.894 --> 01:50:23.994]  What an amazing coincidence that this is happening.
[01:50:23.994 --> 01:50:27.855]  And they get to roll out a medical, martial law, police state.
[01:50:27.855 --> 01:50:35.277]  And they get to censor people who are anti-vaccine, saying that you're responsible for causing all these deaths because you didn't promote the vaccine.
[01:50:35.277 --> 01:50:37.837]  I mean, think about all that this accomplishes.
[01:50:37.837 --> 01:50:40.298]  This is sort of a globalist dream come true.
[01:50:41.172 --> 01:50:42.933]  It hits on all these notes.
[01:50:42.933 --> 01:50:45.414]  And that's why I think this is no longer a coincidence.
[01:50:45.414 --> 01:50:46.634]  I don't think it's an accident anymore.
[01:50:46.634 --> 01:50:50.776]  I think it was engineered, and it's made to look like an accident.
[01:50:50.776 --> 01:50:53.377]  But for whatever reason, they chose China.
[01:50:53.377 --> 01:50:58.399]  Maybe some globalists want to get rid of the communists first, but they knew this was going to spread globally.
[01:50:58.399 --> 01:51:00.020]  They knew this could not be contained.
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:07.943]  And now that we have the CDC admitting that, that it's coming to America, what they call community outbreaks, we know this is a global killer.
[01:51:07.943 --> 01:51:09.464]  At Bill Gates' 10 million number,
[01:51:10.572 --> 01:51:12.033]  That's best case scenario.
[01:51:12.033 --> 01:51:20.785]  It's more like hundreds of millions if this really infects 60% of the world population as is predicted by some scientists like the Hong Kong doctors and scientists.
[01:51:20.785 --> 01:51:21.586]  I mean we're talking about
[01:51:22.458 --> 01:51:24.299]  Mike, you just said it, the final piece of the puzzle.
[01:51:46.141 --> 01:51:50.746]  And again, you've been right all along on what was coming next, and we were all hoping it was just accidentally released.
[01:51:50.746 --> 01:51:55.051]  Because why the hell would you do it when it's so obviously a bioweapon that the Chinese have?
[01:51:55.051 --> 01:51:57.033]  But maybe they didn't release it, they stole it.
[01:51:57.033 --> 01:52:02.078]  Somebody else knew they stole it, and they released it to set them up, and Xi's just making...
[01:52:02.859 --> 01:52:04.981]  Lemonade with lemons.
[01:52:04.981 --> 01:52:14.869]  I mean, regardless, we've always known when the global financial collapse comes, the UN, Bill Gates and others have said, we'll keep globalism together with a global pandemic.
[01:52:14.869 --> 01:52:16.670]  Global response to a global pandemic.
[01:52:16.670 --> 01:52:17.551]  And that's it.
[01:52:17.551 --> 01:52:26.378]  The way the central banks get out of this and blame a world financial meltdown, if not this year, next year, the year after, is with a new deadly virus.
[01:52:26.378 --> 01:52:30.382]  So whether it is ultra deadly or not, we know it spreads fast and it's killing a lot of people.
[01:52:30.382 --> 01:52:31.282]  We know it's mutating.
[01:52:32.043 --> 01:52:45.051]  But they can tell us that whatever's killing people, whatever's going on, whatever they pull, whenever they want, is the coronavirus and then use that as the excuse to bring down the Ponzi scheme that they themselves know they can't prop up much longer.
[01:52:45.051 --> 01:52:48.693]  Because we know they can't prop it up much longer.
[01:52:48.693 --> 01:52:50.474]  Look, every government made entitlement promises.
[01:52:52.163 --> 01:52:53.565]  They absolutely cannot.
[01:52:53.565 --> 01:52:58.290]  They cannot pay the pensions in Illinois or the city of Chicago or even at a federal level.
[01:52:58.290 --> 01:53:00.913]  They cannot pay the Social Security promises.
[01:53:00.913 --> 01:53:02.274]  They can't pay Medicare.
[01:53:02.274 --> 01:53:04.436]  Look, this system ends one way or another.
[01:53:04.436 --> 01:53:09.342]  What the globalists have figured out here is that they can end it in a way that doesn't cast blame on them.
[01:53:10.248 --> 01:53:11.710]  They can find a scapegoat.
[01:53:11.710 --> 01:53:13.252]  How they always find a scapegoat.
[01:53:13.252 --> 01:53:16.477]  They had a scapegoat for the assassination of JFK.
[01:53:16.477 --> 01:53:19.782]  They have a scapegoat for 9-11.
[01:53:19.782 --> 01:53:24.027]  Even though, of course, we know they allowed that attack to happen for all sorts of reasons.
[01:53:24.967 --> 01:53:31.449]  Uh, if not actively involved in it, but they always have a scapegoat because continuity of government is what matters to them.
[01:53:31.449 --> 01:53:35.551]  They, the elitists and the controllers and the bureaucrats, they want to survive.
[01:53:35.551 --> 01:53:48.175]  And they have to be the savior and they have to have their system in position to make sure we follow orders during a major war, during a major outbreak, while the UN attacks the borders and attacks the infrastructure.
[01:53:48.795 --> 01:53:53.098]  At the very same time, to bring in the collapse, but they want a controlled collapse.
[01:53:53.098 --> 01:53:57.001]  And I believe Trump is not working with them and has been trying to prop it up.
[01:53:57.001 --> 01:54:00.564]  Even though the bubble's not good, no one wants to be there when it implodes.
[01:54:00.564 --> 01:54:08.490]  He wants to have defeated the deep state, gotten people ready, released a bunch of suppressed technologies to try to create new economies before the collapse.
[01:54:08.490 --> 01:54:10.751]  And that's why things are so incredibly dangerous.
[01:54:10.751 --> 01:54:12.012]  Mike Adams, amazing job.
[01:54:12.012 --> 01:54:15.055]  Please join us again throughout the weekday broadcast.
[01:54:15.055 --> 01:54:16.796]  Tomorrow, the next day, whenever you can pop in.
[01:54:17.136 --> 01:54:22.458]  This has been some of the most important radio I think we've ever done here, and I think everybody knows truth when they hear it.
[01:54:22.458 --> 01:54:34.824]  We've got all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, and now the last pieces are plopping in, and we're not saying this to scare people, we're saying it so people can have plans, be prepared, and know how serious the situation is.
[01:54:34.824 --> 01:54:37.705]  Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com, thank you.
[01:54:37.705 --> 01:54:38.846]  Thank you.
[01:54:38.846 --> 01:54:41.887]  Alright, I'm out of time, but I wanted to end with some good news.
[01:54:45.438 --> 01:54:50.182]  Hillary Clinton is incredibly obnoxious, and almost everyone hates her.
[01:54:50.182 --> 01:54:52.184]  But still, she's delusional and thinks she can win.
[01:54:52.184 --> 01:54:54.086]  Same thing with Bloomberg.
[01:54:54.086 --> 01:55:01.632]  And it's the same thing with Michael Avenatti, who was the savior of everyone, and invincible, and he's God, and he's going to defeat Trump.
[01:55:01.632 --> 01:55:04.135]  And notice now, he's been indicted a bunch of times.
[01:55:04.135 --> 01:55:06.056]  He's nothing but a dirty crook.
[01:55:06.056 --> 01:55:09.620]  Everybody knew that, who already knew who he was, out in Los Angeles for years.
[01:55:10.802 --> 01:55:13.886]  And so it just shows how, yeah, evil has plans.
[01:55:13.886 --> 01:55:17.411]  And it seems like sometimes they're really powerful and can't be defeated.
[01:55:17.411 --> 01:55:21.838]  But, in the end, God is in control, and these people will be defeated.
[01:55:21.838 --> 01:55:25.062]  So here's a boil-down of the fall of their Savior, Abinadi.
[01:55:25.805 --> 01:55:29.267]  He's Donald Trump's worst nightmare, Michael Avenatti.
[01:55:29.267 --> 01:55:30.748]  Joining us once again is Michael Avenatti.
[01:55:30.748 --> 01:55:31.929]  Let's bring in Michael Avenatti.
[01:55:31.929 --> 01:55:32.609]  Michael Avenatti.
[01:55:32.609 --> 01:55:33.389]  Michael Avenatti.
[01:55:33.389 --> 01:55:35.050]  Michael Avenatti, thank you very much.
[01:55:35.050 --> 01:55:36.651]  He's out there saving the country.
[01:55:36.651 --> 01:55:39.013]  Don Meacham says he may be the savior of the republic.
[01:55:39.013 --> 01:55:41.014]  You are something of a folk hero now.
[01:55:41.474 --> 01:55:43.315]  Oh, Michael Avenatti, an apology.
[01:55:43.315 --> 01:55:44.896]  I've been saying enough already, Michael.
[01:55:44.896 --> 01:55:45.896]  I've seen you everywhere.
[01:55:45.896 --> 01:55:46.916]  What do you have left to say?
[01:55:46.916 --> 01:55:48.477]  I was wrong, brother.
[01:55:48.477 --> 01:55:49.918]  You have a lot to say.
[01:55:49.918 --> 01:55:53.359]  I am just dying to hear what you think.
[01:55:53.359 --> 01:55:54.560]  These people all like you.
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:58.701]  I'm the only person right here Donald Trump fears more than Robert Miller.
[01:55:58.701 --> 01:56:03.263]  We think you guys are the tip of the spear that's going to take down Donald Trump.
[01:56:03.263 --> 01:56:04.304]  Michael Avenatti's a beast.
[01:56:05.047 --> 01:56:06.108]  Okay, that's true.
[01:56:06.108 --> 01:56:07.028]  He's a beast.
[01:56:07.028 --> 01:56:07.748]  He's a beast.
[01:56:07.748 --> 01:56:10.789]  I hand it to her, and I hand it to Michael Avenatti.
[01:56:10.789 --> 01:56:15.671]  He has a bigger calling here, that being a lawyer is minimal compared to what he's doing.
[01:56:15.671 --> 01:56:21.233]  No one has talked tougher directly to Donald Trump on TV than Michael Avenatti.
[01:56:21.233 --> 01:56:24.234]  And Donald Trump is afraid to mention his name.
[01:56:24.234 --> 01:56:25.495]  That's fascinating.
[01:56:25.495 --> 01:56:28.356]  Donald Trump is terrified of Michael Avenatti.
[01:56:28.796 --> 01:56:31.560]  Trump will run for his money more than anybody else, Michael Avenatti.
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.884]  Existential threat to the Trump presidency.
[01:56:33.884 --> 01:56:35.766]  The Democrats could learn something for you.
[01:56:35.766 --> 01:56:38.410]  You are messing with Trump a lot more than they are.
[01:56:38.410 --> 01:56:44.038]  He has no doubt created sheer panic in Donald Trump's very fragile mind.
[01:56:44.178 --> 01:56:48.360]  Michael Avenatti is laying down the law as guest co-host.
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.602]  And is he really thinking about running for president?
[01:56:51.602 --> 01:56:55.844]  One reason why I'm taking you seriously as a contender is because of your presence on cable news.
[01:56:55.844 --> 01:56:59.226]  You look at the field of Democrats right now and Avenatti's the one who stands out.
[01:56:59.226 --> 01:57:04.689]  If they decide they value a fighter most, people would be foolish to underestimate Michael Avenatti.
[01:57:04.689 --> 01:57:06.470]  I have always said that they need a fighter.
[01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:08.611]  Look, I mean, we're going to continue to use the media.
[01:57:08.611 --> 01:57:10.252]  I think we've used it with great success.
[01:57:13.274 --> 01:57:15.377]  All of my sexual fantasies involve handcuffs.
[01:57:19.161 --> 01:57:20.863]  Yeah, he actually said that, folks.
[01:57:20.863 --> 01:57:24.105]  So there's their God, their Savior, their Lord, their King.
[01:57:24.105 --> 01:57:25.446]  He's a total joke.
[01:57:25.446 --> 01:57:35.936]  Just like all these other corrupt lawyers attacking Trump supporters and trying to take folks off the air, they're all going to end up just like that dirtbag, creepy porn lawyer in the dustbin of history.
[01:57:35.936 --> 01:57:37.797]  The globalists are over.
[01:57:37.797 --> 01:57:38.458]  They're finished.
[01:57:38.458 --> 01:57:43.082]  And so is their witch god, Hillary, and her little footstool, Bloomberg.
