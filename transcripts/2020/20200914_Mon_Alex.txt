[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:09.171]  The United Nations was founded by social Darwinists to carry out the orderly dumbing down and extermination of humanity.
[00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:13.631]  And they've been trying it for over a hundred years.
[00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:15.372]  The same group.
[00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:19.052]  And they mean business.
[00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:23.513]  And they're now finally getting us in the position to be able to carry that out.
[00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:28.814]  But they're not going to be able to carry this out
[00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:31.254]  If we say no.
[00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:53.024]  The problem is they are now in the normalization mode where you wake up and the UN is in control of the media and of the universities and of the institutions and of the think tanks and Communist China is wedded to it and has total control in their response over our response
[00:00:55.424 --> 00:01:00.109]  And now they tell us our military is going to be under the UN and our police are going to be under the UN.
[00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.110]  It's not coming.
[00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.830]  It's here.
[00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.794]  And now we're at the moment of truth where we have to reject it.
[00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:11.339]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:24.742]  COVID madness reigns supreme as only one stadium allowed fans in to watch the NFL opener replete with anti-American, kneeling millionaires.
[00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:34.647]  And as the COVID backlash candidate platform gains traction, the case against hydroxychloroquine continues to get shuffled into a Mockingbird media closet.
[00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:40.129]  A major setback in the hopes that the drug hydroxychloroquine could be used as a possible treatment for coronavirus.
[00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.352]  A clinical study indicates the drug touted by President Trump does not work and in fact may have a high death risk.
[00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:52.855]  While the real experts continue to pile on the case against the coronavirus lockdown.
[00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:55.617]  Now this latest study, just that.
[00:01:56.613 --> 00:01:57.755]  Says they're wrong, they're wrong!
[00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:09.294]  Hydroxychloroquine is effective, it's right in the title, is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 and may be universally effective when used early before hospitalisation.
[00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:10.838]  It is a combination.
[00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.541]  They've looked at all the studies of hydroxychloroquine over the past few months.
[00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:21.863]  The jury is in and the jury says very clearly, if you look at all the studies, the following is very clear.
[00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:32.348]  Hydroxychloroquine is consistently effective against COVID-19 when used early in the right combination with other drugs.
[00:02:32.688 --> 00:02:32.988]  Infectious
[00:02:47.585 --> 00:03:03.539]  This disease expert and University of Edinburgh professor Mark Wohlhaus recently said that the lockdown was a panic measure and he believes history will say trying to control COVID-19 through lockdown was a monumental mistake on a global scale.
[00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.861]  The cure was worse than the disease.
[00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:19.538]  Woolhouse went on to say that he believes the harm lockdown is doing to our education, healthcare access, and broader aspects of our economy and society will turn out to be at least as great as the harm done by COVID-19.
[00:03:19.838 --> 00:03:23.563]  As the latest international testing of hydroxychloroquine
[00:03:23.763 --> 00:03:35.029]  Treatment of coronavirus showed countries that had early use of the drug had a 79% lower mortality rate than countries that banned the use of the safe malaria drug.
[00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:50.096]  The Washington Post had reported that while there was no vaccine for COVID-19, there is one potentially promising treatment to help people infected with the coronavirus, infusions of antibody-rich plasma from other patients who have had the disease and recovered.
[00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:58.999]  A couple months later, the Washington Post again touted the potential of blood plasma, also called convalescent plasma, in treating the virus.
[00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:15.725]  But as soon as Trump announced that a breakthrough treatment for the coronavirus, convalescent plasma, had been given emergency approval by the FDA, the Washington Post suddenly said scientists expressed doubts about coronavirus treatment, touted as a breakthrough by Trump.
[00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:26.511]  Recently, AstraZeneca paused its vaccine clinical trial due to a potentially unexplained illness, which Dr. Fauci flippantly said is not uncommon.
[00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:28.613]  You know, it's not uncommon at all.
[00:04:28.813 --> 00:04:34.957]  I mean, we see this generally for the most part, but you don't know until you investigate it.
[00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:43.742]  It's an adverse event that's related to something else that just happened to have occurred during the period of time that the clinical trial was on.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.781]  The government is going to mandate this product.
[00:04:50.723 --> 00:05:04.591]  No matter how grievous your injury or your child's injury, no matter how toxic the ingredient, no matter how sloppy the line protocols, no matter how negligent that company, you cannot sue them for redress.
[00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:10.294]  So there's no discovery, there's no depositions, there's no medical malpractice, there's no class actions.
[00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:15.276]  Zero consequence if they kill you or if they injure you for life.
[00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:31.723]  Fauci covers for a plandemic where the peasants can't have their convalescent plasma or hydroxychloroquine and many will suffer and die so that Governor Cuomo's book coddles his fragile ego and hides the genocide he waged on thousands of elderly New Yorkers.
[00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:36.825]  Fauci will get his payoff and Bill Gates will achieve his eugenicist victory.
[00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:51.172]  As the mindless hordes are programmed by a social media-induced imprisonment following the guidelines of the 2010 Rockefeller lockstep scenario published in Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development.
[00:05:51.532 --> 00:06:01.817]  The CDC had to finally admit that only 6% or less than 10,000 deaths had been directly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning.
[00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:07.858]  Revealing a plandemic so massive that we can hardly wrap our minds around it.
[00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:09.459]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:10.939]  We'll be right back.
[00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:12.580]  That key report's at band.video.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.440]  Only you can save lives.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:25.523]  All the censorship is because the social engineers know what they're selling is very unpopular, very destructive, and is going to kill the third world and impoverish and enslave the first.
[00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:28.563]  So remember, they count on you being silent.
[00:06:28.603 --> 00:06:30.704]  They count on you not speaking out.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.381]  I went down to the river today.
[00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:37.302]  They call it Lady Bird Lake.
[00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:40.963]  It's a river, the Colorado River, and swam about a mile.
[00:06:42.324 --> 00:06:46.866]  And when I got out of the water and walked back to my car, I talked to every person on the way, about 20 people.
[00:06:48.326 --> 00:06:50.127]  Half of them were listeners and shook my hand.
[00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:59.191]  The other people seemed responsive when I exposed to them that COVID-19 is about a hundred times less lethal than the flu now.
[00:07:00.882 --> 00:07:06.407]  And that Fauci's now come out and said you should take vitamin D and vitamin C, something he said don't do before.
[00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:20.841]  He knows how criminal he is and he knows all these big medical doctors are forming coalitions against him for daring to say you don't need essential vitamins and minerals when their own NIH website says you will die without them.
[00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.405]  But the United Nations will openly censor you
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.382]  If you try to still tell people that vitamin D, C, and then of course things like zinc are essential.
[00:07:36.762 --> 00:07:41.084]  So I have hundreds and hundreds of incredible reports, but that's our top story, what the United Nations is doing.
[00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:48.306]  Again, thank you for joining us on this September 14th, Monday transmission, 49 days out from the historic election.
[00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:55.748]  We have Brian Ross, great investigative journalist, reporter, self-help guru,
[00:07:56.894 --> 00:08:00.816]  Viral sensation joining us in the third hour.
[00:08:01.976 --> 00:08:03.457]  Gerald Cilente will host the fourth.
[00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:10.980]  But I do want to, coming up at the bottom of the hour, open the phones up on a large range of specific topics.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.121]  So let me just tell you what's coming up.
[00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:15.402]  This is a town hall article.
[00:08:15.642 --> 00:08:21.224]  Big Tech removes a video from prominent think tank for contradicting WHO on coronavirus.
[00:08:22.844 --> 00:08:32.446]  The Hoover Institution at Stanford University doesn't get more establishment leaders than that, said the United Nations should not be in control of the U.S.
[00:08:32.466 --> 00:08:35.627]  healthcare system, and that it was a threat to national security.
[00:08:38.027 --> 00:08:40.808]  And so that was removed by all the big tech, so you can't see it.
[00:08:42.108 --> 00:08:43.189]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:45.969]  We're under the U.N.
[00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:46.509]  right now.
[00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.750]  Not just our medical.
[00:08:50.143 --> 00:08:51.564]  All the blue cities are under UN.
[00:08:51.604 --> 00:08:54.627]  This is a strategic plan to collapse the United States.
[00:08:57.629 --> 00:09:11.420]  But now something you heard here 20 years ago is now mainstream news and it's now the Hoover Institution coming out saying we cannot have the United Nations dictate health care, especially when a lot of what they said is false.
[00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:19.367]  Strong cities set up by Obama put local cities under UN control and local police departments
[00:09:21.468 --> 00:09:23.029]  Our borders are going under UN control.
[00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.831]  Trump understands this and pulled us out of the WHO.
[00:09:27.071 --> 00:09:30.573]  He needs to pull us completely out of the criminal organization that is the United Nations.
[00:09:32.494 --> 00:09:40.939]  Because that's the parallel governmental system that the Democrats are taking orders from and have sworn allegiance to.
[00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:45.321]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:46.702]  That's just one article.
[00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:56.539]  And I was already intending to come on here today and say our top story is that the United Nations, more and more, is in control of everything we do.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.844]  That's a foreign outside group conquering us that says that Communist China
[00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:27.304]  Is the model we should live under, and that we should be on permanent lockdown, and have our children taken from us, if we supposedly have COVID, when 90% of the tests were false positive, and it's now probably, the numbers are showing, not 10 times weaker than the flu, but in most areas like Hawaii or Australia, 100 plus times weaker.
[00:10:31.386 --> 00:10:34.148]  So everything now revolves around the fact that
[00:10:35.572 --> 00:10:44.995]  There is a planetary authoritarian corporate world government that set up China as the model that works through the UN, the Bill of Melinda Gates, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds control.
[00:10:47.176 --> 00:10:59.100]  And they are now taking control of the nation states and now have standardized lockdowns or house arrest, martial law all over the planet and have simply circumvented
[00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:06.369]  The central governments that aren't under their total control, like the UK and the United States and Sweden.
[00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:20.137]  And that's why the UN now shows up in events in Texas and Utah at city buildings and hotels and at public convention centers and says, we are United Nations forces.
[00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:24.100]  You are not allowed to come into this facility or have press.
[00:11:25.868 --> 00:11:27.289]  Obama administration and the U.N.
[00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:31.231]  announced global police force to fight extremists in the U.S.
[00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:34.892]  I've played the clips of Loretta Lynch on the show.
[00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:42.016]  And next, that leads us to James Mattis denounces President Trump, describes him as a threat to the Constitution.
[00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:42.956]  This is out of the Atlantic.
[00:11:44.997 --> 00:11:51.741]  The key fake news outfit right after it came out that Mattis has been plotting a coup, a military coup against the President, which is truly a threat.
[00:11:52.571 --> 00:12:01.116]  to the Constitution and it's made the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, have to come out and say that's illegal and we will not be part of this attempted coup.
[00:12:02.397 --> 00:12:17.185]  That two members of the Armed Services Committee, one CIA, one Clinton Foundation, sent letters to Milley last month asking him to prepare for the arrest of Trump and his cabinet and of his main supporters.
[00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:20.146]  You say, well they'll never do this.
[00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:22.303]  They're certainly trying.
[00:12:22.664 --> 00:12:29.395]  Meanwhile, Newsom signs bill removing automatic penalty for consensual sex acts involving minors down to age 14.
[00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:47.471]  As you can see, it looks like scenes of hell out of California with the fires where they have had hundreds of arrests for arson, videos of arsonists setting roads on fire, medians on fire, firebombing fields in high winds.
[00:12:47.952 --> 00:12:50.033]  They arrest them, they're Antifa, they're BLM.
[00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:58.840]  It comes out in the local newspapers and Facebook and the rest of them block it and say there is no arson.
[00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:03.175]  He was on the last big fire in Colorado, they admitted, was an arsonist.
[00:13:04.496 --> 00:13:05.757]  I mean, what does Earth First do?
[00:13:05.797 --> 00:13:07.879]  What does the Animal Liberation Front do?
[00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:10.341]  They go and they burn down ski resorts.
[00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:28.616]  That's what these people do, and they're making their move against the American middle class and against our economy to destroy it so the big megabanks can dictate our surrender, and that's what they talk about in the whole Cloward and Piven documents.
[00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:40.534]  So this is a strategic plan laid out and prepared a very, very long time ago.
[00:13:40.594 --> 00:13:45.737]  We'll be laying it all out as the dangers rise.
[00:13:45.837 --> 00:13:48.899]  Many fear their California dream is fading.
[00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:54.263]  But Governor Newsom says it's climate change.
[00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:54.643]  Well, yes.
[00:13:55.882 --> 00:14:04.305]  Humans came in and built firebreaks, and so the area that was bad for fires before we did it stopped having the big fires because they were stopped by firebreaks.
[00:14:05.025 --> 00:14:07.806]  But in the 70s, California passed laws banning firebreaks.
[00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:13.809]  In the 80s, the feds did in most areas, and so now the state is a giant tinderbox.
[00:14:15.049 --> 00:14:24.913]  And even state agency heads said, this is from lack of firebreaks and lack of management of the forest, but that's okay.
[00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:32.992]  Because Newsom wants to drive everyone out of the state into the other states to bring the whole country down.
[00:14:34.052 --> 00:14:37.333]  That is the larger strategic plan.
[00:14:37.373 --> 00:14:38.413]  Just like the NFL.
[00:14:38.953 --> 00:14:42.254]  They don't care if they lost 40% of their ratings a few years ago, they're back again!
[00:14:42.274 --> 00:14:54.157]  They never really recovered with not coming out for the National Anthem, kneeling for the National Anthem, a bunch of spoiled brats working for a corrupt mega-globalist corporation,
[00:14:56.311 --> 00:14:58.592]  Never saying a word about the slave camps in China.
[00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:03.634]  The coaches wearing bubbles over their heads and disgusting virtue signaling.
[00:15:04.274 --> 00:15:05.595]  This is the land of the slaves.
[00:15:06.115 --> 00:15:07.055]  The home of the cowards.
[00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:09.236]  Empty moronic idiots.
[00:15:10.517 --> 00:15:14.038]  Living in a country built on people that were rugged individualists that stood up for human freedom.
[00:15:14.898 --> 00:15:16.199]  Pissing all over their birthright.
[00:15:17.119 --> 00:15:18.300]  And even destroying
[00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:21.649]  Their viewership because it's an attack.
[00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:34.916]  America is under economic, cultural, financial, and physical attack by a consortium of multinational corporations controlling China and directed by the United Nations, put in power by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers on record.
[00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:40.839]  And they are now making their move against you.
[00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:43.320]  I mentioned some of what's coming up.
[00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:51.349]  We also have the execution and shooting of police all over the country being celebrated by the Democratic Party and their official organs will cover it all.
[00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:53.970]  49 days.
[00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:55.951]  49 days out.
[00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:58.652]  The most important election in world history.
[00:15:58.812 --> 00:16:12.799]  A referendum between the forces of good, Christianity, national sovereignty, capitalism, the right to self-defense, a pro-human future, versus the globalists and their order that can only be described as purely
[00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.092]  Anti-human and satanic.
[00:16:15.312 --> 00:16:16.393]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:16:17.054 --> 00:16:20.497]  I am extremely thankful and honored to be here today with you.
[00:16:21.558 --> 00:16:30.045]  Now, every time I'm about to go on air and I look at the news and I look at the clips and I look at the information and I know the backstory, I just marvel how dead on we've been.
[00:16:30.926 --> 00:16:38.713]  Because let me be honest, I've been very ashamed of myself in the last 25-26 years, having to tell people things this horrible.
[00:16:39.973 --> 00:16:45.035]  I just, genetically, it doesn't feel good at a cellular level to always give people bad news.
[00:16:46.716 --> 00:16:50.638]  But another part of me felt good doing it, knowing it was the right thing to do so that people could get prepared.
[00:16:51.058 --> 00:17:02.063]  But I don't like having to sit there and walk by people at a park that are picnicking with their kids and walk over and say, you know they're tainting vaccines with sterilants and chemicals to brain damage and sterilize your children.
[00:17:03.319 --> 00:17:07.202]  But I have a responsibility to do that now to everyone I see.
[00:17:07.342 --> 00:17:11.265]  And I do it in grocery stores, and I do it on the street, and I do it at restaurants.
[00:17:13.207 --> 00:17:14.408]  It's horribly obnoxious.
[00:17:14.988 --> 00:17:15.608]  But you know what?
[00:17:16.129 --> 00:17:16.529]  It's not.
[00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.412]  I was brought up to think that's obnoxious, but it's not.
[00:17:20.452 --> 00:17:21.593]  That's how we're going to defeat the enemy.
[00:17:23.114 --> 00:17:27.037]  And so I basically, unless I'm in a total hurry, talk to almost everybody I come by.
[00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:32.962]  And if we all start doing that, it's over for the New World Order.
[00:17:33.817 --> 00:17:36.282]  Because what they're selling is so artificial and so evil.
[00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:39.809]  But I want this to sink in for you right now.
[00:17:40.651 --> 00:17:42.414]  The United Nations
[00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:53.253]  is a corrupt, child-trafficking, narcotics-dealing, above-the-law criminal organization that absolutely hates the people that are under its control.
[00:17:54.173 --> 00:18:11.145]  And many third-world countries are run by the United Nations and treat the third world like total slaves and want to keep them poor, want to sterilize them, want to dumb them down and have total disdain and set up IMF and World Bank deals to keep the third world in poverty and control.
[00:18:12.878 --> 00:18:19.461]  And that's all come out with documents that have been released, and John Perkins, and the UN documents, and all the IMF and World Bank documents.
[00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:22.842]  And the UN admits that they're actually killing people with their vaccines.
[00:18:22.882 --> 00:18:24.122]  I mean, the evidence goes on and on.
[00:18:26.383 --> 00:18:34.887]  To even start getting into the United Nations, to even start talking about all of the outrageous crimes they've committed, is dizzying.
[00:18:35.067 --> 00:18:39.829]  But know this, their World Human Rights Board,
[00:18:40.802 --> 00:18:47.624]  It's headed up by Communist China, Saudi Arabia, and other incredible anti-human tyrannies.
[00:18:49.165 --> 00:18:49.665]  It's a joke.
[00:18:52.346 --> 00:19:02.089]  And the United Nations was set up by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds on record to take over national sovereignty and finally dissolve our military and disarm our populations for total control.
[00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:07.991]  And that's its admitted founding plan, but not for peace, but so no one can oppose it.
[00:19:09.534 --> 00:19:23.036]  And now Joe Biden comes out and says, we're going to take the semi-autos from the American people, riotous leftist, anti-fund, BLM riot across the country, and threaten Americans in their homes.
[00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.837]  Joe Biden calls to ban the assault weapons.
[00:19:28.397 --> 00:19:30.137]  And we have the clip.
[00:19:30.238 --> 00:19:30.918]  We have the tweet.
[00:19:30.978 --> 00:19:32.298]  It's up at GatewayPundit.com.
[00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:33.478]  It's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:33.498 --> 00:19:34.558]  But let's look at this first.
[00:19:34.978 --> 00:19:35.738]  This is so huge.
[00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:36.539]  It's not a town hall.
[00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:38.699]  It has links to the
[00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.580]  Stanford University and the Hoover Institution.
[00:19:43.701 --> 00:19:49.124]  So you don't get more establishment than the Hoover Institution.
[00:19:49.924 --> 00:19:52.245]  Now you saw Cedars-Sinai six months ago.
[00:19:52.305 --> 00:20:00.089]  Trump said, hey, they've got lights they can put down your throat into your bronchioles that kills viral infections.
[00:20:02.271 --> 00:20:04.232]  Cedars-Sinai had a video out saying it was true.
[00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:05.192]  It was banned.
[00:20:06.153 --> 00:20:07.793]  And then you've seen the thousands of other cases.
[00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:08.394]  Well, look at this.
[00:20:09.738 --> 00:20:17.140]  This is the Hoover Institute saying it's wrong to censor doctors and local hospitals with treatments that they say work.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.560]  This isn't American.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.721]  It's dangerous to only follow what the United Nations says.
[00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:24.602]  And that was censored.
[00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:32.924]  And even in the interview with their fellows, they prostrate themselves and go, I'm not a COVID denier.
[00:20:32.944 --> 00:20:36.745]  You have to first say, oh, it's real.
[00:20:39.431 --> 00:20:50.139]  Even the CDC statistics that it was almost a hundred times weaker than what they previously said, those are censored.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.461]  So listen to this.
[00:20:53.541 --> 00:20:55.403]  This is the UN in control.
[00:20:56.664 --> 00:21:01.767]  Big Tech removes a video from prominent think tank for contradicting the WHO and coronavirus.
[00:21:01.787 --> 00:21:02.368]  So Big Tech
[00:21:03.308 --> 00:21:08.591]  Takes its orders, not from the American people, not from Congress, not from the law, but from the U.N.
[00:21:10.392 --> 00:21:11.973]  So Congress won't do anything.
[00:21:12.073 --> 00:21:13.074]  Congress won't stand up.
[00:21:13.514 --> 00:21:14.394]  Oh, but the U.N.'
[00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:14.875]  's in charge.
[00:21:16.115 --> 00:21:20.318]  The Hoover Institution at Stanford University is one of the most prominent think tanks in America.
[00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:23.680]  Its fellows are some of the most accomplished in their respective fields.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.641]  But that doesn't matter to big tech.
[00:21:26.564 --> 00:21:38.574]  YouTube recently removed a June 23rd interview its senior fellow Dr. Scott Atlas did with the Hoover because it goes against the World Health Organization's position on the Wuhan coronavirus.
[00:21:39.274 --> 00:21:42.777]  We have a banned video section of Banned.Video, the most banned, the most banned.
[00:21:43.117 --> 00:21:45.940]  We're gonna get that interview, we're gonna find it, and we will.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.703]  We're gonna post it in the next hour to Banned.Video.
[00:21:50.563 --> 00:21:54.987]  According to Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research and Equal Opportunity,
[00:21:56.107 --> 00:22:04.479]  The decision was made because the video contradicts, this is a quote, the World Health Organization or local health authorities' medical information about COVID-19.
[00:22:04.899 --> 00:22:06.442]  But that's an out for them.
[00:22:06.762 --> 00:22:08.545]  The UN censors the local health authorities.
[00:22:09.946 --> 00:22:19.733]  In the interview description it explains that Atlas is not a COVID-19 denier, but that the one-size-fits-all approach we are currently using is overly authoritarian.
[00:22:20.233 --> 00:22:20.273]  Oh!
[00:22:21.054 --> 00:22:23.276]  Inefficient and not based on science.
[00:22:23.976 --> 00:22:24.176]  Ooh!
[00:22:24.596 --> 00:22:30.681]  Moreover, he argues, an economic shutdown and all of the attended issues that go with it is a terrible solution.
[00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:33.843]  The transcript is still available online here.
[00:22:33.903 --> 00:22:37.426]  We're going to find the video, but we're going to post this article with the full transcript.
[00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:41.103]  Hoover Institute on COVID-19 Authoritarianism.
[00:22:42.765 --> 00:22:44.307]  Censored by the United Nations.
[00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.951]  Hoover Institute.
[00:22:47.071 --> 00:22:48.433]  Censored by the United Nations.
[00:22:49.574 --> 00:22:51.937]  Slash Big Tech for criticizing COVID response.
[00:22:52.318 --> 00:22:53.480]  Read full transcript here.
[00:22:54.775 --> 00:22:55.375]  That's what we'll put up.
[00:22:56.256 --> 00:23:05.939]  As Molly Hemingway pointed out, the decision to remove this is utterly terrifying because the World Health Organization has a track record of being wrong with alarming frequency.
[00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:09.521]  But even if they were right most of the time, who died and made them God?
[00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:20.645]  First it's private citizens like Alex Jones, then it's scientists and nurses and doctors and Cedars-Sinai, and now it's the Hoover Institute.
[00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:26.630]  And we've got the banned video on there about UV light and COVID.
[00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:28.114]  All of this is facts.
[00:23:29.378 --> 00:23:30.622]  And that's why they don't want you to know about it.
[00:23:33.117 --> 00:23:37.938]  And they go on to say, but beyond that, in America, there must be ability to hear other perspectives.
[00:23:38.038 --> 00:23:38.318]  Really?
[00:23:38.738 --> 00:23:41.999]  Well, don't tell big tech, the so-called liberals that, because they're not liberals.
[00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:54.881]  They're fascist, communist, absolute authoritarian, make the Nazis blush, monsters above the law that don't pay any taxes and are offshore, living on giant estates with jumbo jets and kidnapped slaves.
[00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:57.582]  They're scum.
[00:23:57.622 --> 00:23:58.462]  They're monsters.
[00:23:58.662 --> 00:23:59.862]  They're drug addict filth.
[00:24:00.882 --> 00:24:04.102]  They're the trash of the earth that have nothing but disdain for you and your family.
[00:24:06.809 --> 00:24:09.450]  I've got the latest on COVID, now the whole hoax is coming down.
[00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:22.976]  Now Fauci even said, okay, take your vitamin C and your D3, because that little murderer knows that that's blown up in his face saying don't take it, and that that's the main cause that any virus will kill you if you're deficient in those.
[00:24:23.577 --> 00:24:31.600]  Fauci is a murdering, globalist criminal who engineered the virus to take control of humanity at Wuhan Lab.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.621]  He is a criminal.
[00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:45.775]  Remember last October, November, and December, I said the archetypal image was an astronaut in a national park in front of a creek with big redwood trees and mountains behind him.
[00:24:47.016 --> 00:24:55.901]  And I said the archetypal image that I pick up is a bioweapon, or the pretext of a bioweapon, that humans can't be safe in their environment and have to live in bubbles.
[00:24:59.684 --> 00:25:03.086]  And then I said the next big archetype is red clouds.
[00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.171]  Over America.
[00:25:06.852 --> 00:25:09.174]  And now look at the West Coast.
[00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:10.395]  You're a TV viewer.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:25.528]  You see, the subconscious mind, the connection to the spirit, the connection to the infinite is real, but we see through a rose-colored darkly.
[00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.390]  That's a rose-colored darkly.
[00:25:30.872 --> 00:25:31.453]  A distortion.
[00:25:33.683 --> 00:25:41.649]  The universe is too big, too infinite to be able to consciously absorb it, but unconsciously we have a chance to begin to plumb its depths.
[00:25:43.151 --> 00:25:46.854]  And everything the enemy does is about turning that power off.
[00:25:48.335 --> 00:25:51.177]  You're not going to be able to use those powers to pick the winning lottery ticket.
[00:25:52.478 --> 00:25:55.461]  But when you're doing it for the right reasons, you'll be able to know what the enemy is going to do next.
[00:25:55.981 --> 00:26:03.167]  If you simply relax and make a connection to God and really want to know the secrets of the universe for the right reasons, you will be given those secrets.
[00:26:05.745 --> 00:26:11.768]  But then you'll have to ask yourself the question, are you going to have the courage in the moment to do what's right?
[00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:22.595]  Go through the artificial pain for a few minutes to protect yourself of the innocence forever.
[00:26:25.076 --> 00:26:33.781]  That's the allegory of the cheesy movie, but it's a good book, Dune, where he has to stick his hand in the pain induction box and hold it there while it's bubbling and melting away.
[00:26:35.472 --> 00:26:40.316]  And of course it's all pain by induction and creates an artificial hologram of his hand melting off.
[00:26:41.677 --> 00:26:43.639]  But he's able to do it because he's not an animal.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:53.988]  He's able to go through the pain and control his mind and lock it off and know that he has to go through that to physically survive.
[00:26:55.709 --> 00:26:57.271]  But they know how to prod us and
[00:26:58.268 --> 00:27:04.570]  Probe us and manipulate us to where we think giving in to the pain induction gets us ahead.
[00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:10.032]  But all they're doing is maneuvering us, herding us into a slaughterhouse.
[00:27:17.134 --> 00:27:20.876]  People say, well how do you handle the pain of being demonized, attacked, lied about?
[00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:21.876]  I expect that!
[00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:30.733]  I'm not trying to glad hand around and social climb and just tell people what they want to hear so I can be part of a rotting, collapsing system.
[00:27:31.373 --> 00:27:34.554]  I want to rebuild the system and have a pro-human future.
[00:27:35.014 --> 00:27:44.258]  And the United Nations was founded by social Darwinists to carry out the orderly dumbing down and extermination of humanity.
[00:27:46.639 --> 00:27:48.719]  And they've been trying it for over a hundred years.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.420]  The same group.
[00:27:53.123 --> 00:27:58.585]  And they mean business and they're now finally getting us in the position to be able to carry that out.
[00:28:01.807 --> 00:28:06.349]  But they're not going to be able to carry this out if we say no.
[00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:20.195]  The problem is they are now in the normalization mode where you wake up and the UN is in control of the media and of the universities and of the institutions and of the think tanks.
[00:28:21.587 --> 00:28:28.134]  And Communist China is wedded to it and has total control in their response over our response.
[00:28:30.517 --> 00:28:35.202]  And now they tell us our military is going to be under the UN and our police are going to be under the UN.
[00:28:35.503 --> 00:28:36.203]  It's not coming.
[00:28:36.504 --> 00:28:36.924]  It's here.
[00:28:37.044 --> 00:28:40.849]  And now we're at the moment of truth where we have to reject it.
[00:28:42.807 --> 00:28:44.488]  But you know, I always knew he was going to reject it.
[00:28:44.508 --> 00:28:50.512]  It's going to be the power structure that began the sellout of America and bought into this whole world government kumbaya.
[00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:53.434]  We're going to have a non-authoritarian world government to end war.
[00:28:53.855 --> 00:29:04.742]  Now everybody in the CIA, the FBI, the Hoover Institute, the Ford, the Carnegie, who aren't the very top of it, are going, we're actually going to get rid of everybody?
[00:29:05.102 --> 00:29:07.144]  We're not going to have any speech, even for academics?
[00:29:08.032 --> 00:29:11.755]  We're not going to be able to say, hey, turns out the virus is a lot less lethal than they said.
[00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.036]  And China's open for business, but we're not.
[00:29:14.436 --> 00:29:18.059]  And now they're saying we'll never take masks off, and we'll have all these forced inoculations.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.940]  And that sounds scary.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.801]  I don't want to do that.
[00:29:20.841 --> 00:29:22.082]  They're like, well, you're censored.
[00:29:22.482 --> 00:29:23.203]  You're fired.
[00:29:23.503 --> 00:29:24.063]  Shut up.
[00:29:25.484 --> 00:29:30.948]  See, now you're all silenced because you didn't build your own infrastructure.
[00:29:30.968 --> 00:29:32.069]  And I'm talking to the establishment.
[00:29:33.697 --> 00:29:34.917]  You thought you were the establishment.
[00:29:34.937 --> 00:29:36.858]  Now you learned they don't need an establishment anymore.
[00:29:37.078 --> 00:29:37.898]  They have computers.
[00:29:38.518 --> 00:29:39.439]  They have technocracy.
[00:29:40.079 --> 00:29:41.879]  They have centralization.
[00:29:42.099 --> 00:29:43.520]  So let's just look at some of these headlines.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.221]  Big tech now censoring biggest think tanks in the U.S.
[00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:49.562]  that call for the reopening of the economy.
[00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:51.402]  You're not allowed to ever do that.
[00:29:51.462 --> 00:29:52.682]  You're not allowed to have speech.
[00:29:52.923 --> 00:29:54.943]  You're not allowed to say you want to brave the elements.
[00:29:55.383 --> 00:29:56.764]  No, the U.N.
[00:29:56.824 --> 00:29:58.164]  and big tech said so.
[00:30:00.105 --> 00:30:01.125]  And they say so in China.
[00:30:02.912 --> 00:30:07.034]  Meanwhile, CNN medical analyst calls indoor Trump rally negligent.
[00:30:07.375 --> 00:30:10.556]  Homicide suggests Trump should shake some hands.
[00:30:12.117 --> 00:30:13.758]  Well, yeah, it's not even as deadly as the flu.
[00:30:13.798 --> 00:30:14.219]  He should.
[00:30:15.479 --> 00:30:22.123]  Global COVID-19 cases top 29 million after WHO reports record jump live updates, but not record deaths.
[00:30:22.543 --> 00:30:24.945]  All hype, all fake tests, all fraud.
[00:30:26.285 --> 00:30:26.746]  Fauci.
[00:30:27.626 --> 00:30:32.069]  I'm taking vitamin D supplements, we'll play the clip in a moment, to help prevent COVID
[00:30:33.638 --> 00:30:35.859]  A gram of vitamin C would be fine.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.941]  Oh, can I have a glass of water a day, too?
[00:30:38.961 --> 00:30:41.903]  Oh, Fauci!
[00:30:41.923 --> 00:30:45.905]  But he's doing that because he before said, oh, don't worry, no, no.
[00:30:46.446 --> 00:30:47.526]  Supplements don't help you.
[00:30:48.487 --> 00:30:51.729]  Vitamin D3 and zinc and C, they don't help you.
[00:30:51.949 --> 00:30:54.611]  And they'd have the FBI raid medical doctors.
[00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:57.712]  They were prescribing vitamin C as a preventative.
[00:30:58.172 --> 00:31:01.133]  SWAT teams with machine guns.
[00:31:02.073 --> 00:31:03.993]  Because it was not authorized by who?
[00:31:04.594 --> 00:31:07.394]  The United Nations!
[00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:08.735]  Yay!
[00:31:09.195 --> 00:31:10.395]  You wake up and you're a slave.
[00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:13.996]  But there's such a backlash to this little rat.
[00:31:15.017 --> 00:31:15.917]  This little monster.
[00:31:18.218 --> 00:31:21.459]  Oh, is oxygen essential too?
[00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:22.739]  How about water?
[00:31:22.759 --> 00:31:25.280]  And I told you,
[00:31:26.724 --> 00:31:31.508]  I've sat there in offices with business owners, lawyers, you name it.
[00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.391]  Former high-level federal agents.
[00:31:37.893 --> 00:31:39.955]  And they go, Alex, be honest with me.
[00:31:40.335 --> 00:31:41.436]  Does vitamin D3 really help?
[00:31:42.557 --> 00:31:44.218]  Or, Alex, I've heard you talking about zinc.
[00:31:44.238 --> 00:31:45.299]  You got in some trouble for that, didn't you?
[00:31:45.699 --> 00:31:48.461]  I mean, the UN says that nothing helps.
[00:31:50.763 --> 00:31:52.244]  And one time, I just went, F you, man.
[00:31:52.745 --> 00:31:53.746]  I said, you're an idiot.
[00:31:54.585 --> 00:31:58.150]  I mean, I cannot handle grown men that are willfully idiots!
[00:32:02.435 --> 00:32:05.659]  But I'm telling you, the more professional somebody is in America, the dumber they are!
[00:32:05.979 --> 00:32:07.041]  Willfully stupid!
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.483]  I know people that work in all these courthouses and stuff and they say the judges are the most afraid of COVID.
[00:32:14.523 --> 00:32:29.314]  It's all just getting into fear and getting into little diapers they put on their faces and it's all about selfishness and so they create rituals of how they can be selfish and weird and scared and get into all this crap because they're a bunch of domesticated idiotic cowards.
[00:32:29.835 --> 00:32:32.757]  Let's go out to break with Fauci and that horrible little voice of his.
[00:32:35.572 --> 00:32:38.793]  Talking about, oh yes, now you're allowed to have it because he said so.
[00:32:38.813 --> 00:32:39.173]  Here it is.
[00:32:39.633 --> 00:32:41.173]  It's not something that you can recommend.
[00:32:41.433 --> 00:32:44.614]  But there are two vitamins that you should consider.
[00:32:45.054 --> 00:32:52.396]  For example, if you are deficient in vitamin D, that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection.
[00:32:52.856 --> 00:32:59.358]  So I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.
[00:32:59.938 --> 00:33:04.782]  The other vitamin that people take is vitamin C because it's a good antioxidant.
[00:33:05.182 --> 00:33:11.326]  So if people want to take a gram or two at the most of vitamin C, that would be fine.
[00:33:11.627 --> 00:33:12.527]  Oh, that would be fine?
[00:33:12.547 --> 00:33:13.948]  So vitamin C and vitamin D, okay.
[00:33:14.469 --> 00:33:16.150]  Oh, thank you, you little demon!
[00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.512]  Oh, did you hear Fauci said we need oxygen?
[00:33:19.632 --> 00:33:21.013]  Oh, thank you, Fauci!
[00:33:22.495 --> 00:33:25.016]  But he didn't tell you the most important one because he wants a high death rate.
[00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:27.018]  That's why I recommended sending folks to the nursing homes to kill him.
[00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:28.830]  Zinc.
[00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:29.970]  You will die without it.
[00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:33.691]  That's the main thing that stops replication of viruses in mitochondria.
[00:33:33.931 --> 00:33:34.172]  Zinc!
[00:33:34.392 --> 00:33:35.612]  Zinc, you little filthy rat!
[00:33:35.692 --> 00:33:36.412]  You little murderer!
[00:33:36.872 --> 00:33:37.993]  Burn in hell, murderer!
[00:33:38.213 --> 00:33:39.293]  Burn in hell, Fauci!
[00:33:39.473 --> 00:33:40.933]  We'll get you, don't worry, murderer!
[00:33:44.054 --> 00:33:57.638]  The very same United Nations that is implementing the worldwide collapse of the extra 8 million people set to starve to death this year, hundreds of millions waiting to die,
[00:33:59.352 --> 00:34:06.736]  Going hungry every day, shriveling up till a regular virus comes by and kills them because they're malnourished.
[00:34:08.677 --> 00:34:11.458]  When you look at Fauci and Bill Gates, they are the main architects.
[00:34:11.878 --> 00:34:12.579]  They cooked it up.
[00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.620]  They ran the plan with the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.061]  They engineered the whole deal.
[00:34:18.243 --> 00:34:25.004]  And the, oh, just 15 days, oh, just two more months, just three more months, just six more months, now it's never go back to normal.
[00:34:25.384 --> 00:34:29.625]  I said two years a few months ago, no, sorry, never shake hands again, never.
[00:34:30.385 --> 00:34:31.626]  Everything's over, okay?
[00:34:31.686 --> 00:34:33.906]  Because that's what Bill Gates wants.
[00:34:33.926 --> 00:34:35.586]  Remember Fareed Zakaria?
[00:34:35.966 --> 00:34:43.548]  Five months ago said, things will never go back to normal, and Gates goes, that's right, and started laughing and smiling, and it was so beautiful, it was so good.
[00:34:45.492 --> 00:34:51.635]  Because they believe they're saving the earth by reducing the population and lowering your consumerism.
[00:34:51.875 --> 00:34:56.337]  Which you could say we consume too much, we're wasteful, humans do hurt the environment in many cases.
[00:34:56.778 --> 00:35:03.661]  But you have a bunch of rich robber barons that are super corrupt with jumbo jets and five kids apiece and everything saying, we're gonna die.
[00:35:03.681 --> 00:35:12.886]  And the average liberal leftist goes to school and learns there's too many people and that humans are bad, but they pretend like they're not being targeted.
[00:35:15.558 --> 00:35:17.499]  These guys want to get rid of almost everybody.
[00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:20.920]  And they want to stunt human development and all the rest of it.
[00:35:21.181 --> 00:35:22.921]  We've developed all these clean technologies.
[00:35:23.802 --> 00:35:25.863]  And the globalists act like they're the guardians of the Earth.
[00:35:25.963 --> 00:35:27.263]  They're the ones destroying the Earth.
[00:35:29.304 --> 00:35:36.528]  So again, you have the UN now telling the Hoover Institution that they can't have a YouTube on their channel.
[00:35:37.799 --> 00:35:49.105]  Talking about how COVID was exaggerated and how the lockdown is going to cause millions and millions more dead from suicide and lack of medical attention to starvation than COVID, which is an admitted fact.
[00:35:51.627 --> 00:35:55.409]  They didn't even criticize that the UN's info was all wrong in their video.
[00:35:55.429 --> 00:35:58.430]  They just said it's wrong to have the UN in control.
[00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.612]  And of course you can't say you don't want the UN in control.
[00:36:01.892 --> 00:36:03.233]  That's not allowed.
[00:36:07.694 --> 00:36:15.780]  And of course now, we told you six months ago the shortages were going to start, the food prices would go up, and you're already seeing it here, and now mass starvation in the third world.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:24.346]  So when you see Fauci, you're seeing someone causing millions to die, but CNN and MSNBC aren't going to tell you that most of the dead are going to be in Africa.
[00:36:25.927 --> 00:36:30.090]  They're going to show a cop once a month that might shoot a black person in the wrong.
[00:36:32.632 --> 00:36:35.914]  Thousands dead black males a year in Chicago by other black males.
[00:36:36.014 --> 00:36:36.455]  No one cares.
[00:36:39.206 --> 00:36:41.587]  But they'll show you the cop that might shoot somebody in the wrong.
[00:36:43.427 --> 00:36:44.508]  As it turns out, that's not true.
[00:36:45.628 --> 00:36:47.769]  And man, then cops get shot all over the country.
[00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:51.070]  It's like six or seven cops have been killed in the last week.
[00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:54.591]  Two more shot almost, you know, in critical condition in L.A.
[00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:55.131]  yesterday.
[00:36:55.732 --> 00:37:00.633]  And then Black Lives Matter went to the place and chanted, we hope you die.
[00:37:01.574 --> 00:37:02.554]  Play the video next hour.
[00:37:04.375 --> 00:37:08.096]  And then major Democratic Party groups like the Gravel Institute
[00:37:10.208 --> 00:37:12.650]  Said, police lives do not matter.
[00:37:14.871 --> 00:37:20.215]  Folks, they just are sicking the general population on the police to drive the police into submission.
[00:37:20.435 --> 00:37:25.598]  The left wants control of the police to come for the guns and to come enforce the COVID garbage.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.442]  They want control of police policy and they're getting it in most areas.
[00:37:32.943 --> 00:37:37.947]  And they just send in these mindless idiots to say, we hope that your compatriots
[00:37:39.036 --> 00:37:42.777]  Your Confederates, we hope your other police officers die.
[00:37:42.797 --> 00:37:45.878]  And they say, we're going to kill you, we hope you die.
[00:37:45.938 --> 00:37:46.858]  Bang, bang, oink, oink.
[00:37:47.078 --> 00:37:54.480]  They wonder why the cops put their hands on their guns when a mob of people come to a hospital where people are fighting for their lives and say, we want you dead.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:03.582]  I have stacks of videos of Trump supporters being shot, stabbed, beaten, children having eggs thrown in their faces.
[00:38:06.202 --> 00:38:08.443]  And the media defending it and saying it's a good thing.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:19.988]  Because this media is bought and paid for by multinational corporations that never get held accountable and are trying to break this country up and just sit there and allow America to be put in the bacon grease.
[00:38:22.891 --> 00:38:25.113]  Fire bombings all over the West Coast.
[00:38:25.673 --> 00:38:27.555]  I've seen five arrest videos.
[00:38:28.843 --> 00:38:34.687]  Of them catching people with cans of gasoline in fields in Oregon and California, setting fields on fire and setting medians on fire.
[00:38:34.967 --> 00:38:40.211]  These Antifa people and Black Lives Matter attendees have been arrested and charged.
[00:38:41.031 --> 00:38:44.574]  And when it starts coming out that the people that set the fires in Oregon were Antifa?
[00:38:48.596 --> 00:38:49.077]  What happens?
[00:38:51.398 --> 00:38:52.479]  What happens, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:38:53.823 --> 00:39:01.325]  Facebook, Google, Twitter, all of them in unison, ban it and say there is no arson because Governor Newsom says it's not arson.
[00:39:01.726 --> 00:39:02.366]  Smiling?
[00:39:05.207 --> 00:39:07.267]  More American psycho than anything I've ever seen.
[00:39:07.287 --> 00:39:09.348]  Looking like he just won the lottery.
[00:39:09.608 --> 00:39:12.469]  Just like when Bill Gates talks about everything collapsing and America being over.
[00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:18.011]  And there's Gavin Newsom up there like he just got immortal, eternal life.
[00:39:22.438 --> 00:39:24.380]  Because they're going to collapse the United States.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:30.004]  This is a foreign, multinational attack to bring down the United States.
[00:39:31.826 --> 00:39:35.148]  Dozens of arrests in Oregon, catching them in the act.
[00:39:38.851 --> 00:39:39.832]  There's a bunch of these videos.
[00:39:40.072 --> 00:39:42.855]  You see the cops pull up and they see a guy in a pickup setting fires.
[00:39:43.215 --> 00:39:43.815]  They follow him.
[00:39:43.835 --> 00:39:45.317]  He drives and starts setting another one.
[00:39:45.737 --> 00:39:49.200]  Just running around, setting fires everywhere.
[00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:59.274]  And then the governor gets up there, the globalist governor on the Chinese payroll, and says, nobody's attacking you.
[00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:00.535]  There's nobody doing this.
[00:40:00.736 --> 00:40:01.997]  There's no such thing as Antifa.
[00:40:03.638 --> 00:40:07.080]  And it's citizens, by the way, also they're now catching people.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.382]  They're now citizen militias, they're just forming.
[00:40:11.083 --> 00:40:16.808]  And they are now apprehending and arresting people, burning down buildings, burning down crops, burning down everything.
[00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:26.172]  All right, I'm gonna start the next hour, give the number out, and I'll get to all those clips I just mentioned to you, but this is just incredible.
[00:40:27.412 --> 00:40:32.814]  Absolutely incredible that you wake up and this is going on.
[00:40:32.894 --> 00:40:49.017]  They're attacking our dollar, they're attacking our military, the police, local governments are directing the takedown and the collapse of the cities, the mayors, the governors in blue states, because this is the organized military, economic, cultural, spiritual attack to bring down the country.
[00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:52.829]  And they're demoralizing us with pedophile TV shows.
[00:40:54.110 --> 00:41:00.274]  And all of this, admittedly, you know, I sent some crew to the Sundance Film Festival two years ago.
[00:41:00.594 --> 00:41:09.360]  And I came, and they came back and told you that they said the main mission, because they got into some of the inner meetings, were to destroy America and destroy everybody's morale and create a race war.
[00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:19.007]  And that's why you turn on Netflix and it is like the most America-hating garbage, human-hating, family-hating, suicides-exploding, because that's their goal.
[00:41:19.895 --> 00:41:22.617]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have to lay down to this.
[00:41:23.998 --> 00:41:25.119]  I'm going to tell you again, though.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.341]  There's already a global depression.
[00:41:28.521 --> 00:41:30.582]  Whether Trump wins or loses, things are going to be hard.
[00:41:31.636 --> 00:41:33.257]  You need to get high-quality, storable food now.
[00:41:33.777 --> 00:41:34.858]  It's the no-brainer thing.
[00:41:34.898 --> 00:41:38.859]  We have the best company, the biggest company, the highest quality, the best containers.
[00:41:38.919 --> 00:41:39.820]  It lasts the longest.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.581]  And you go right to the head of the line at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:41:43.241 --> 00:41:48.884]  One to two weeks delivery of My Patriot Supply at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:41:48.904 --> 00:41:50.905]  We have their full selection.
[00:41:51.005 --> 00:41:51.966]  They're in our back end.
[00:41:52.026 --> 00:41:52.846]  We're partners with them.
[00:41:53.746 --> 00:41:56.828]  And you notice you don't hear them advertising on all the other big talk shows.
[00:41:58.291 --> 00:41:58.851]  I'm a partner.
[00:41:59.292 --> 00:42:01.754]  That's why we're able to even still sit here and have it for you.
[00:42:03.495 --> 00:42:06.297]  And that's why you need to go to MFORESTORE.COM because they believe in what we're doing.
[00:42:06.317 --> 00:42:07.638]  They believe in our mission.
[00:42:08.699 --> 00:42:12.202]  The owner of it is here with us right now in our studios today, Matt Redhawk.
[00:42:12.222 --> 00:42:20.288]  He doesn't want to come on air, but he's working very closely with us to make sure you get right to the front of the line when you get those orders in at MFORESTORE.COM or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:20.308 --> 00:42:20.949]  And I would not wait.
[00:42:24.091 --> 00:42:32.236]  Until the next big attack, or the next big war that starts, or the next big economic crisis that the globalists are going to pull, I would get storable food now.
[00:42:32.376 --> 00:42:35.879]  I would get water filtration with the Alexa Pure Breeze, also made by Matt Redhawk.
[00:42:36.199 --> 00:42:38.980]  They went out and got Top Fern to make the very best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:42:39.221 --> 00:42:40.782]  It's the highest rated gravity-fed filter.
[00:42:41.676 --> 00:42:45.599]  InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:46.099 --> 00:42:52.803]  We also have the Save Infowar, Save the Republic, Save Yourself Super Sale, up to 60% off and free shipping on DNA Force Plus.

[00:43:09.113 --> 00:43:11.468]  Eight-pack PowerStack with X2 spray, 60% off as well.

[00:44:02.146 --> 00:44:04.288]  You're keeping us on air at the most critical time.
[00:44:04.348 --> 00:44:05.689]  The globalists cannot stand it.
[00:44:05.889 --> 00:44:07.010]  So again, I thank you all!
[00:44:08.063 --> 00:44:11.445]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[00:44:11.465 --> 00:44:12.626]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:44:12.646 --> 00:44:14.247]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[00:44:14.367 --> 00:44:15.748]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[00:44:15.848 --> 00:44:16.869]  I want them shut down.
[00:44:16.949 --> 00:44:17.849]  I want them silenced.
[00:44:17.889 --> 00:44:18.590]  I want them muted.
[00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:20.511]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:44:20.551 --> 00:44:21.492]  You kept us on air.
[00:44:21.612 --> 00:44:22.913]  We did the analysis first.
[00:44:23.173 --> 00:44:24.173]  It's now gone mainstream.
[00:44:24.233 --> 00:44:26.075]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[00:44:26.335 --> 00:44:32.218]  And what they've said directly to us is, you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[00:44:32.439 --> 00:44:33.900]  And you need to stop right now.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.040]  And they're very, very serious.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.522]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[00:44:37.722 --> 00:44:38.743]  This is not going to happen.
[00:44:38.763 --> 00:44:40.384]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[00:44:40.864 --> 00:44:41.965]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[00:44:42.426 --> 00:44:43.326]  Rescue InfoWars.
[00:44:43.406 --> 00:44:44.047]  Save yourself.
[00:44:44.407 --> 00:44:45.028]  Save the world.
[00:44:45.368 --> 00:44:46.229]  We're in this together.
[00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:47.950]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.971]  Communism's up here.
[00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:52.113]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[00:44:52.514 --> 00:44:54.335]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:44:54.555 --> 00:44:56.096]  My children are right here!
[00:44:56.817 --> 00:44:58.578]  But I need money to fight a war!
[00:44:58.759 --> 00:45:00.260]  And I need word of mouth!
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.160]  And I need prayer!
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.041]  And I need action!
[00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:04.023]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[00:45:04.723 --> 00:45:06.685]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[00:45:07.366 --> 00:45:11.010]  This Greg Reif's report we're about to air is so powerful I'm airing it a second day in a row.
[00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:12.792]  The full report's at Bandot Video.
[00:45:13.253 --> 00:45:14.073]  It's so important.
[00:45:14.114 --> 00:45:17.758]  Please get the report and share it with everyone you know.
[00:45:17.778 --> 00:45:23.284]  Arsonist agents of the left set fire to West Coast as Democrat leaders blame climate change.
[00:45:25.026 --> 00:45:26.187]  This perfect storm.
[00:45:26.688 --> 00:45:29.271]  The debate is over around climate change.
[00:45:29.832 --> 00:45:32.195]  Just come to the state of California.
[00:45:32.796 --> 00:45:34.317]  Observe it with your own eyes.
[00:45:34.418 --> 00:45:35.679]  It's not an intellectual debate.
[00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.521]  It's not even debatable.
[00:45:37.702 --> 00:45:40.786]  The debate is over around climate change.
[00:45:42.028 --> 00:45:47.352]  California's rogue governor says the fires are due to climate change.
[00:45:48.113 --> 00:45:53.498]  But anyone with a modicum of awareness knows that this is an outrageous lie.
[00:45:54.759 --> 00:45:58.141]  We know exactly what causes the California wildfire.
[00:45:58.742 --> 00:46:03.066]  It is the result of two factors, dry seasons and people.
[00:46:03.926 --> 00:46:12.355]  Official state records have only been kept since the 1950s, and 2020 has been the most destructive season on record.
[00:46:13.196 --> 00:46:19.643]  But this isn't a new phenomenon, and the fires of the past were more destructive than the modern era.
[00:46:20.804 --> 00:46:35.131]  Through studies of tree rings and other natural evidence, researchers have documented multiple droughts in California during the past thousand years, including one that began in the year 850, which lasted two and a half centuries.
[00:46:36.232 --> 00:46:46.497]  Before European settlers arrived in California, indigenous peoples used controlled burns to manage the dry season and to increase and improve their harvest.
[00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:52.043]  It is estimated they would burn 4.4 million acres of forest each year.
[00:46:52.944 --> 00:46:54.366]  And that is twice as much as 2020.
[00:46:56.028 --> 00:47:01.334]  Studies have shown that 97% of all forest fires are caused by humans.
[00:47:02.014 --> 00:47:06.480]  Smoking, campfires, and other accidents have always been a problem.
[00:47:07.165 --> 00:47:13.127]  Experts blame the recent wildfires on fire suppression and an overabundance of wood fuel.
[00:47:13.888 --> 00:47:19.130]  One of the reasons why the indigenous people burned so much forest was to keep this under control.
[00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.012]  Aside from human accidents, there is also arson.
[00:47:24.732 --> 00:47:27.093]  And we have seen plenty of arson in 2020.
[00:47:28.634 --> 00:47:29.874]  It's been sort of the theme.
[00:47:30.174 --> 00:47:36.317]  If this country doesn't give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it.
[00:47:36.997 --> 00:47:41.199]  Several people have been arrested for starting fires along the entire West Coast.
[00:47:42.299 --> 00:47:44.960]  Homeowners are catching arsonists on their property.
[00:47:46.081 --> 00:47:51.403]  There are reports of people throwing Molotov cocktails out of moving vehicles on the freeway.
[00:47:59.561 --> 00:48:03.425]  And there are videos of arsonists setting people's homes on fire.
[00:48:04.667 --> 00:48:11.895]  We know for certain that at least one of the arrested arsonists is directly involved with the BLM Antifa movement.
[00:48:13.136 --> 00:48:16.299]  And the rest certainly seem to fit the bill.
[00:48:19.264 --> 00:48:20.905]  Local news is reporting on it.
[00:48:20.925 --> 00:48:24.206]  A man has been arrested accused of starting this fire.
[00:48:24.326 --> 00:48:28.888]  One of two men accused of intentionally setting fire to fields along freeways.
[00:48:29.108 --> 00:48:32.809]  But the FBI and the mainstream media are in full denial.
[00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:42.113]  A Clackamas County Sheriff's deputy was placed on administrative leave after warning locals about coordinated arson attacks.
[00:48:42.293 --> 00:48:45.175]  What I'm worried about is that there's people stashing stuff.
[00:48:45.516 --> 00:48:45.916]  Right.
[00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:48.738]  It means that they're going to go in preparation.
[00:48:48.858 --> 00:48:49.318]  Right.
[00:48:49.799 --> 00:48:53.502]  And I don't want to sound like some doomsday-er, but it's getting serious.
[00:48:54.133 --> 00:48:58.016]  And the Democrat Party is telling you it is all climate change.
[00:48:58.176 --> 00:48:59.957]  Mother Earth is angry.
[00:48:59.977 --> 00:49:10.365]  She's telling us, whether she's telling us with hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, fires in the West, whatever it is, that the climate crisis is real and has an impact.
[00:49:10.726 --> 00:49:17.070]  And telling you that the fires will soon come to your town if you don't vote for climate change.
[00:49:17.491 --> 00:49:18.892]  What we're experiencing right here
[00:49:19.873 --> 00:49:26.416]  Is coming to community all across the United States of America unless we get our act together on climate change.
[00:49:26.656 --> 00:49:35.880]  Which is a pretty nasty threat considering how many cities across America have burned by the hands of radical leftists over the summer.
[00:49:37.676 --> 00:49:57.270]  The 2006 film Apocalypto beautifully illustrated how the ancient Mayans' advanced knowledge of astronomy could have been used to frighten the superstitious masses into offering their own to be sacrificed on the altar of false idols, who had the power to blacken out the sun.
[00:49:58.591 --> 00:50:00.733]  And there is nothing new under the sun.
[00:50:01.393 --> 00:50:04.276]  People today will throw away their children's birthright.
[00:50:04.956 --> 00:50:05.937]  Kleptomania!
[00:50:07.486 --> 00:50:08.347]  Pyromania.
[00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:11.889]  Necrophilia.
[00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.871]  Pedophilia.
[00:50:17.172 --> 00:50:17.893]  Vampirism.
[00:50:21.335 --> 00:50:22.056]  Masochism.
[00:50:24.437 --> 00:50:29.240]  These are just a few of the historical and psychological terms of things we know about.
[00:50:30.061 --> 00:50:32.342]  Types of people that have been seen over and over again.
[00:50:33.303 --> 00:50:36.245]  Stereotypes that are stereotypes because they're real.
[00:50:38.997 --> 00:50:48.142]  And my friend, Mike Judge, decades ago came out with Beavis and Butthead, who are juvenile delinquents with very low IQs, and what do they like?
[00:50:48.323 --> 00:50:48.703]  Fire!
[00:50:48.783 --> 00:50:49.163]  Fire!
[00:50:49.243 --> 00:50:49.623]  Fire!
[00:50:49.683 --> 00:50:50.043]  Fire!
[00:50:52.545 --> 00:50:55.367]  They like the feeling of power when they see something burning down.
[00:50:55.387 --> 00:50:56.407]  They like destruction.
[00:50:58.248 --> 00:50:59.429]  Because they have low IQs.
[00:50:59.629 --> 00:51:01.510]  Because they resonate with a very low frequency.
[00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:06.233]  But if you look at the dozens of people arrested in Oregon,
[00:51:08.396 --> 00:51:10.677]  And arrested in California.
[00:51:10.697 --> 00:51:12.398]  They look like Beavis and Butthead.
[00:51:12.438 --> 00:51:13.978]  The women look like Beavis and Butthead.
[00:51:15.078 --> 00:51:16.859]  The men look like Beavis and Butthead.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.040]  And they're anti-father and Black Lives Matter.
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.721]  And the local sheriffs talk about it and they get put on leave.
[00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:25.943]  Because Facebook says, you're not allowed.
[00:51:26.023 --> 00:51:28.644]  The ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center that run Big Tech.
[00:51:30.024 --> 00:51:32.325]  They said, oh, there's no arson on the West Coast.
[00:51:33.931 --> 00:51:45.494]  Antiva just posted on their Facebook shots of them in their forestry outfit and their mask with cans of gasoline on their back going out to do important forestry work.
[00:51:48.217 --> 00:51:51.018]  And then they tell you it's climate change after they launched the terror attacks.
[00:51:51.438 --> 00:51:55.780]  And what do they say in the 70s and 80s with the rewilding project the feds and leftist states passed?
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:01.542]  They said we're going to let things go back to quote its natural way before humans existed.
[00:52:01.562 --> 00:52:05.023]  We're not going to cut fire breaks and we'll just let fire take its course.
[00:52:06.224 --> 00:52:09.225]  Making much of the West uninhabitable.
[00:52:11.726 --> 00:52:12.826]  And you know why would they do that?
[00:52:12.906 --> 00:52:14.887]  Because when you look at Governor
[00:52:16.837 --> 00:52:21.619]  Newsome, I mean, if I was going to cast somebody as a psychotic lying demon, it'd be him.
[00:52:22.859 --> 00:52:32.202]  Up there in the fire, in the smoke, saying, this is climate change, looking like, again, he just got a billion dollar lottery.
[00:52:33.623 --> 00:52:39.665]  Because they're organizing the crisis, the COVID to lock you down, the fires to lock you down, and they engineered this
[00:52:41.018 --> 00:52:47.141]  And the fires get worse each year because they won't let anybody under California law clear out any of the underbrush.
[00:52:50.363 --> 00:52:56.566]  Of course, the indigenous thousands of years ago, they've done all the studies, cleaned out all those areas.
[00:52:59.188 --> 00:53:01.429]  And they did bigger control burns.
[00:53:01.809 --> 00:53:05.471]  You know, growing up in Texas, if the wind turns towards the north, we always get smoke.
[00:53:06.946 --> 00:53:07.386]  In the fall.
[00:53:08.147 --> 00:53:11.649]  And it's the Mexican farmers burning their fields.
[00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.311]  And why do they burn their fields?
[00:53:14.471 --> 00:53:15.591]  And why do they cut breaks?
[00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:16.732]  And why do they trim the jungle?
[00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:25.017]  Because they're putting firebreaks in, and then they scoop up the ash from the firebreaks that they, every four or five years, they rotate it.
[00:53:25.057 --> 00:53:25.958]  They'll burn different ones.
[00:53:25.978 --> 00:53:27.078]  You don't have to burn it every year.
[00:53:27.619 --> 00:53:29.360]  They'll burn the brush that grows up in a firebreak.
[00:53:30.196 --> 00:53:36.021]  And then they take that ash and wheelbarrows, and they dump it on their crops, and they don't have to buy the expensive fertilizer.
[00:53:36.341 --> 00:53:38.623]  Mexican farmers don't buy fertilizer, folks.
[00:53:39.964 --> 00:53:42.086]  They do it the way we used to, and the crops are better.
[00:53:43.367 --> 00:53:44.829]  But again, that's all agriculture.
[00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:49.513]  Agriculture itself has been taken away from us, and we've gotten chemical agriculture now.
[00:53:50.714 --> 00:53:57.880]  And some farmers do that, and that's their business, but they have extincted agriculture that is renewable.
[00:53:59.977 --> 00:54:04.620]  So the globalists always tell you they're doing stuff for the earth, but it's never for the earth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:05.181 --> 00:54:06.982]  Everybody knows Mexican produce is excellent.
[00:54:07.002 --> 00:54:11.285]  Now they're trying to get some of their own big farms, their chemical farms, their own corruption, their own problems.
[00:54:11.925 --> 00:54:15.388]  But still, especially in southern Mexico, it is indigenous.
[00:54:18.484 --> 00:54:20.126]  So they said go back before humans were here.
[00:54:20.366 --> 00:54:34.659]  Well before humans did firebreaks, they know from the records there were fires 5, 10, 20 times bigger that sometimes would burn across half the United States or half of what's Russia or half of areas of Africa, destroying millions and millions of acres.
[00:54:39.844 --> 00:54:42.106]  But humans make the environment better in many cases.
[00:54:43.564 --> 00:54:45.125]  Especially when it comes to agriculture.
[00:54:45.965 --> 00:54:54.689]  That's where all the wildlife floods into human agriculture belts and floods into areas where humans pump water up out of the underground aquifers and turn deserts green.
[00:54:55.209 --> 00:54:56.309]  We do a great job.
[00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.890]  We're good.
[00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:57.550]  We're valuable.
[00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:58.190]  We're not bad.
[00:55:00.131 --> 00:55:01.812]  We're not creating the animal-human clones.
[00:55:01.832 --> 00:55:04.513]  We're not creating all the GMO crops that don't even produce seeds.
[00:55:09.266 --> 00:55:10.606]  And even mainstream news gets it.
[00:55:10.646 --> 00:55:12.087]  California's always had fires.
[00:55:12.147 --> 00:55:14.767]  Environmental alarmism makes them worse than necessary.
[00:55:16.068 --> 00:55:17.188]  On purpose.
[00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:26.390]  Prehistoric fire area and emissions from California forest, woodlands, shrublands and grasslands show the fires were much worse in the past than they are now.
[00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:30.571]  But the old fire breaks that haven't been built since the 70s are grown up.
[00:55:32.932 --> 00:55:34.612]  And so it's going to get bad.
[00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:46.551]  But Newsom is so pleased with what he's done.
[00:55:48.373 --> 00:55:49.194]  Economic attack.
[00:55:50.936 --> 00:55:51.957]  Attack by the fires.
[00:55:52.738 --> 00:55:53.639]  Attack by the culture.
[00:55:53.679 --> 00:55:54.680]  Attack on our dollar.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.041]  Attack on our sovereignty.
[00:55:56.081 --> 00:55:56.962]  Attack on the military.
[00:55:57.263 --> 00:55:57.963]  Attack on the police.
[00:55:58.003 --> 00:56:06.813]  Attack from leftist governments on the lowest level of government, the police, to bully them into total submission that if they don't do what they're told, they will die.
[00:56:08.362 --> 00:56:09.262]  That leads me to this.
[00:56:09.342 --> 00:56:10.402]  I'm sure you've already all seen it.
[00:56:10.422 --> 00:56:11.863]  We covered it last night on the Sunday Show.
[00:56:12.723 --> 00:56:13.583]  Hope they die!
[00:56:13.623 --> 00:56:18.164]  Protesters gather outside a hospital, treating two California deputies shot in the ambush.
[00:56:18.804 --> 00:56:23.345]  It's silent video, but here's the footage of the deputies parked outside.
[00:56:23.385 --> 00:56:27.566]  A black male comes over, shoots both of the sheriff's deputies in the head.
[00:56:29.346 --> 00:56:34.147]  And within an hour of the police releasing the video, all the officers fight with their lives.
[00:56:35.808 --> 00:56:36.808]  Here comes the crowd.
[00:56:39.542 --> 00:56:48.188]  Channing, we hope they die and threatening to kill those police officers and the Democratic Party, Gravel Institute and others came out and defended it.
[00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:51.150]  And Twitter defended it.
[00:56:53.132 --> 00:56:55.534]  Here's some of the video of Black Lives Matter at the hospital.
[00:57:00.951 --> 00:57:02.032]  What's up there black families?
[00:57:02.072 --> 00:57:03.974]  Kev Ward Price, African Talent Coalition.
[00:57:03.994 --> 00:57:05.075]  We are out here at St.
[00:57:05.115 --> 00:57:11.901]  Francis Hospital where two of America's most notorious gang members have been brought to.
[00:57:13.142 --> 00:57:18.787]  We're going to go up here and just check on these murderers right here.
[00:57:19.628 --> 00:57:29.691]  These pigs out here, they are telling us that we cannot come in here and see these individuals who have been shot down at the mother****** train station.
[00:57:30.072 --> 00:57:31.592]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:57:31.652 --> 00:57:33.433]  There's no visitation allowed, sir.
[00:57:33.493 --> 00:57:33.653]  What?
[00:57:33.673 --> 00:57:36.114]  There's no visitation allowed, sir.
[00:57:36.214 --> 00:57:36.434]  Okay.
[00:57:36.474 --> 00:57:38.134]  This is a public hospital right here.
[00:57:38.174 --> 00:57:38.734]  No, it's not.
[00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:39.835]  It's a private hospital, sir.
[00:57:39.955 --> 00:57:41.876]  And you're telling us that we cannot come in here?
[00:57:41.936 --> 00:57:43.256]  It's a private hospital, sir.
[00:57:43.296 --> 00:57:44.456]  It's a private hospital, sir.
[00:57:44.536 --> 00:57:45.217]  It's a public.
[00:57:45.417 --> 00:57:46.457]  No, it's not.
[00:57:46.597 --> 00:57:47.457]  It's not county.
[00:57:47.537 --> 00:57:48.058]  It's private.
[00:57:49.378 --> 00:57:49.878]  You need to go.
[00:57:49.918 --> 00:57:50.538]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:50.558 --> 00:57:51.439]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:51.479 --> 00:57:52.239]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:52.279 --> 00:57:53.099]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:53.159 --> 00:57:53.800]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:54.780]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:55.620]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.420]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.201]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:57.241 --> 00:57:57.841]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:57.881 --> 00:57:58.661]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:58.761 --> 00:57:59.682]  You need to go, sir.
[00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:00.562]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:00.582 --> 00:58:01.622]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:01.642 --> 00:58:02.382]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:02.402 --> 00:58:03.323]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:03.343 --> 00:58:04.223]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:04.263 --> 00:58:05.123]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:05.163 --> 00:58:06.004]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:06.064 --> 00:58:07.164]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:07.204 --> 00:58:08.024]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:08.945]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:09.805]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:09.845 --> 00:58:11.065]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:11.085 --> 00:58:11.966]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:12.006 --> 00:58:12.846]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:12.866 --> 00:58:13.586]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:14.146 --> 00:58:14.907]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:15.047 --> 00:58:15.927]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:15.987 --> 00:58:16.867]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:16.907 --> 00:58:17.908]  You need to go, sir.
[00:58:17.988 --> 00:58:18.528]  You need
[00:58:19.288 --> 00:58:27.073]  Imagine trying to go in the hospital where two cops are fighting for their lives and saying they deserve to die and then wondering why you're not let in.
[00:58:27.434 --> 00:58:28.775]  It was an excellent Australian TV piece.
[00:58:44.339 --> 00:59:00.095]  That they lay out the fact that in Melbourne, the police chief said, well we were told to let Black Lives Matter have their demonstration by the mayor because if we didn't they'd burn down the city.
[00:59:00.115 --> 00:59:01.096]  There were 20,000 of them.
[00:59:03.358 --> 00:59:07.322]  But the peaceful anti-mass protests do what we say, so we beat them up.
[00:59:08.493 --> 00:59:17.738]  They say that's orders of the mayor who signed on to the UN and Communist China and signed a treaty with China that China runs Melbourne.
[00:59:19.239 --> 00:59:21.500]  And why doesn't the Australian government just arrest that mayor?
[00:59:22.241 --> 00:59:32.046]  Since we're all under the United Nations, the UN tells major universities like Stanford that they can't interview professors saying COVID's overblown.
[00:59:32.687 --> 00:59:33.967]  And they take down the YouTube video.
[00:59:34.868 --> 00:59:36.369]  That's where we are.
[00:59:37.486 --> 00:59:39.007]  That's where all this has gone.
[00:59:39.027 --> 00:59:40.068]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:40.088 --> 00:59:41.449]  I'm going to give the number out and take your calls.
[00:59:41.469 --> 00:59:42.430]  We have a special guest coming up.
[00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:43.691]  Infowars.com.
[00:59:43.711 --> 00:59:44.612]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:59:45.613 --> 00:59:46.894]  Infowars.com.
[00:59:46.954 --> 00:59:48.015]  Newswars.com.
[00:59:48.075 --> 00:59:49.256]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59:51.124 --> 00:59:54.147]  Now I want to show you what's happening in Australia because this is the model.
[00:59:54.187 --> 00:59:55.027]  This is what's coming here.
[00:59:55.628 --> 00:59:57.109]  This is being announced in Ohio.
[00:59:57.149 --> 01:00:00.792]  It's being announced in California, Canada, and Quebec City.
[01:00:00.852 --> 01:00:03.615]  They're now arresting and grabbing people and taking them out of their homes.
[01:00:04.295 --> 01:00:13.844]  But some of their national newscasters are really starting to get it and understand it and lay out the fact that the police chiefs are admitting, we're ordered to do this.
[01:00:15.267 --> 01:00:17.308]  Because if the public complies, we enslave them.
[01:00:17.368 --> 01:00:19.429]  If you don't comply, you're the boss.
[01:00:19.489 --> 01:00:21.070]  Because, again, the U.N.
[01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:25.112]  mayor says, oh, Black Lives Matter can do whatever they want.
[01:00:25.133 --> 01:00:26.613]  That's a U.N.
[01:00:26.633 --> 01:00:28.134]  George Soros group in Australia.
[01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:31.816]  And so the police have to stand down there.
[01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:37.720]  But if you want to go out and say, we don't want the mask, you're not allowed to because that violates the WHO directive.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.061]  And the mayor of Melbourne has signed on to that.
[01:00:42.179 --> 01:00:43.159]  This is worldwide.
[01:00:43.199 --> 01:00:44.380]  The United Nations in charge.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:54.243]  So here's a woman being drug out of her car at a checkpoint for COVID-19 because they say her phone mount is in the wrong spot.
[01:00:54.723 --> 01:00:56.324]  This is the absolute tyranny.
[01:00:56.364 --> 01:00:56.744]  Here it is.
[01:00:59.025 --> 01:01:00.205]  They saw them everywhere.
[01:01:00.225 --> 01:01:01.906]  They saw them at petrol stations.
[01:01:02.266 --> 01:01:03.486]  That's not the problem anymore.
[01:01:03.506 --> 01:01:05.347]  The problem is you're not standing in line to me.
[01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:07.308]  Just because I have a car charger.
[01:01:07.348 --> 01:01:08.548]  Can you get out of the car, please?
[01:01:08.608 --> 01:01:09.929]  No, I don't feel safe.
[01:01:10.249 --> 01:01:10.749]  You're armed.
[01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:12.648]  You're safe.
[01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:13.548]  Don't you worry about me.
[01:01:13.568 --> 01:01:14.269]  No, I don't feel safe.
[01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:16.109]  You're attempting to get into my vehicle.
[01:01:16.149 --> 01:01:17.570]  What are you doing?
[01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.830]  Why?
[01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:20.190]  Excuse me.
[01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:21.130]  You're not practicing.
[01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.691]  What the f*** are you doing?
[01:01:23.731 --> 01:01:26.392]  What the f*** are you doing?
[01:01:26.452 --> 01:01:27.612]  Get off me!
[01:01:27.652 --> 01:01:28.472]  Get off me!
[01:01:28.613 --> 01:01:29.193]  Relax!
[01:01:29.213 --> 01:01:30.813]  She's got an avoidance.
[01:01:30.913 --> 01:01:31.393]  Relax!
[01:01:31.513 --> 01:01:32.494]  You're killing!
[01:01:32.654 --> 01:01:32.994]  Relax!
[01:01:33.074 --> 01:01:33.954]  She's sick!
[01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:34.614]  You're dead!
[01:01:34.634 --> 01:01:35.454]  She's actually sick!
[01:01:35.534 --> 01:01:35.995]  Relax!
[01:01:36.535 --> 01:01:37.015]  Hey!
[01:01:37.375 --> 01:01:38.915]  Relax!
[01:01:39.135 --> 01:01:41.196]  She was dragged away to a detention center.
[01:01:42.321 --> 01:01:42.941]  At a checkpoint.
[01:01:43.441 --> 01:01:46.803]  Now, here's Andrew Bolt on National TV laying out what really happened.
[01:01:46.843 --> 01:01:47.843]  It's powerful, it's important.
[01:01:47.863 --> 01:01:48.263]  Here it is.
[01:01:49.584 --> 01:01:56.826]  Have you noticed, increasingly, how there seems to be one law for the peaceful and another for the dangerous?
[01:01:57.927 --> 01:02:11.372]  The easier you are to bully around, because you're a law-abiding, nice person, don't want to create too much fuss, the easier you are to bully around, the more your freedoms are actually in danger.
[01:02:12.964 --> 01:02:19.930]  Now, the state where this is most obvious, although it's obvious now everywhere, is Victoria.
[01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.172]  It really is a basket case Victoria.
[01:02:23.212 --> 01:02:26.835]  It really now stands a warning to the rest of Australia.
[01:02:27.416 --> 01:02:28.597]  It's madness there.
[01:02:29.277 --> 01:02:36.123]  Now the first blatant example of this phenomenon of bullying the lawful rather than policing the wicked
[01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:46.652]  The first blatant example I came across in Victoria was 12 years ago when the Bandido bikey gang was actually given a police escort through Melbourne.
[01:02:46.932 --> 01:02:50.234]  Traffic lights all turned off to let them through.
[01:02:50.994 --> 01:02:52.314]  VIP treatment!
[01:02:54.295 --> 01:03:03.318]  Later I saw police have the hide to charge peaceful speakers of the right or the libertarian centre.
[01:03:04.379 --> 01:03:05.019]  Charge them!
[01:03:06.132 --> 01:03:10.533]  For protecting them from the mobs that were unlawfully attacking them.
[01:03:11.393 --> 01:03:13.414]  Marla Yiannopoulos got charged.
[01:03:13.494 --> 01:03:15.534]  Lauren Southern got charged.
[01:03:15.714 --> 01:03:18.615]  The people being attacked got the bill.
[01:03:19.635 --> 01:03:30.878]  But the people actually doing the attacking, breaking the law, throwing rocks, trying to physically, well, not just trying, physically punching and threatening and menacing, they didn't get the bill.
[01:03:32.179 --> 01:03:32.939]  Not from the police.
[01:03:35.538 --> 01:03:36.179]  Unbelievable.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:44.150]  And that's, I think, because the peaceful are more likely to pay up, more likely to take this on the chin.
[01:03:45.371 --> 01:03:49.457]  Whereas Antifa, you go, good luck trying to get a dollar out of that lot.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.021]  But this year,
[01:03:53.379 --> 01:04:01.021]  Came an example that really infuriated a lot of people, changed the debate about the virus panic and how it was policed.
[01:04:01.761 --> 01:04:16.765]  Police did not charge one single person at a Black Lives Matter protest in Melbourne, a couple of, what was it, 10,000, 20,000 people there, did not charge a single one of them for breaking the law, even though
[01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:23.271]  This protest had been banned under the state's tough virus laws.
[01:04:24.071 --> 01:04:28.273]  In fact, some police even kneeled to the protesters who were breaking the law.
[01:04:30.214 --> 01:04:38.036]  But, on the other hand, protesters who have fought these bans have been arrested in their dozens.
[01:04:38.056 --> 01:04:47.180]  They've even been arrested in their homes, in their pyjamas, in front of their children, just for promoting on social media a protest against this
[01:04:47.987 --> 01:04:48.788]  Draconian law.
[01:04:49.128 --> 01:04:56.855]  Or they've had their doors smashed down by police simply for saying they would go and check a protest against these virus bans.
[01:04:59.257 --> 01:05:04.381]  Now, yesterday, Victoria's Police Chief was asked about these double standards.
[01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:09.546]  I have to say, I thought his answer was amazing.
[01:05:09.586 --> 01:05:11.688]  And by amazing, I probably mean disgraceful.
[01:05:12.388 --> 01:05:12.809]  Scary.
[01:05:14.636 --> 01:05:15.536]  His answer was this.
[01:05:16.376 --> 01:05:24.018]  Yes, my police handcuffed a woman in her pyjamas, but didn't handcuff Black Lives Matter protesters.
[01:05:25.879 --> 01:05:33.101]  In fact, they didn't fine or chase away a single one of those Black Lives Matter protesters because of this critical difference.
[01:05:34.741 --> 01:05:37.982]  Those protesters of the left, they are dangerous.
[01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.623]  The really significant thing to remember back then
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:58.893]  Even though we said this was illegal and did not want it to go ahead, we had around the world cities that were burning, we had protests that were violent, we had people being injured, we had property being damaged, places being looted, and absolute mayhem in many societies around the world.
[01:05:59.582 --> 01:06:10.291]  We made a decision here that our priority was public order and on that basis it was going to be impossible to have a peaceful protest if we were going to try and stop 10 to 20,000 people.
[01:06:10.711 --> 01:06:15.595]  We had significant concerns that we would have that type of mayhem in Melbourne.
[01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:20.719]  Well, at least give him marks for honesty.
[01:06:20.739 --> 01:06:22.661]  There you have it.
[01:06:23.812 --> 01:06:32.062]  In Victoria at least, if you are dangerous, if you threaten violence, if you threaten to burn down houses, if you cause mayhem...
[01:06:33.086 --> 01:06:47.192]  The police will then allow you certain rights, like the right to protest, that the police will not allow if you are a calm, nice, peace-loving type, in your pyjamas, in your own home, in front of your children.
[01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:48.112]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:06:48.392 --> 01:06:51.374]  He goes on the full videos on Infowars.com to say this is tyranny.
[01:06:52.154 --> 01:06:53.415]  This is incredibly dangerous.
[01:06:53.435 --> 01:06:57.556]  When we post this up to Bandai Video, we'll put the full thing on the full show as well.
[01:06:57.736 --> 01:06:58.457]  So please make note of that.
[01:06:58.497 --> 01:06:58.877]  Thanks guys.
[01:07:01.028 --> 01:07:05.609]  He finishes up and doesn't give you the final equation, the final answer, the bottom line.
[01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:07.289]  This is U.N.
[01:07:07.329 --> 01:07:07.749]  directed.
[01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:09.210]  The U.N.
[01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.270]  is in control of that city.
[01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:13.831]  In fact, on his show previously, that same talk show host has pointed that out.
[01:07:14.151 --> 01:07:15.111]  So have the other talk show hosts.
[01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:15.971]  I mean, it's under U.N.
[01:07:16.011 --> 01:07:16.271]  control.
[01:07:16.311 --> 01:07:17.511]  It's not an illegal treaty with China.
[01:07:18.212 --> 01:07:19.132]  Just like we're under U.N.
[01:07:19.152 --> 01:07:19.452]  control.
[01:07:20.392 --> 01:07:23.793]  Notice they're facing the same groups, Black Lives Matter, Antifa, all Soros.
[01:07:23.853 --> 01:07:24.473]  It's international.
[01:07:25.891 --> 01:07:31.234]  Their groups are allowed to go out and commit crimes and be violent, and are told to, and the police are told to stand down.
[01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:35.536]  Peaceful groups aren't allowed to because you're just the general public in Australia.
[01:07:35.797 --> 01:07:36.457]  You're an Aussie.
[01:07:36.657 --> 01:07:37.418]  You're an American.
[01:07:37.618 --> 01:07:38.238]  You're a Brit.
[01:07:38.478 --> 01:07:39.179]  You're a German.
[01:07:39.519 --> 01:07:40.399]  You're a Spanish.
[01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:41.300]  You're a Mexican.
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:45.703]  You're not supposed to be able to leave your house, but the criminal groups that work for the U.N.
[01:07:45.723 --> 01:07:47.284]  and the globalists, they're allowed to.
[01:07:47.565 --> 01:07:57.713]  So it's not just that they threaten violence, they've been allowed to set the precedent that they can be violent, and will be violent, and won't be prosecuted by the same mayors that control the same police that are under U.N.
[01:07:57.753 --> 01:07:58.193]  control.
[01:07:58.834 --> 01:08:01.756]  Those mayors need to be SWAT teamed!
[01:08:02.217 --> 01:08:03.398]  They need to go to prison!
[01:08:03.718 --> 01:08:04.278]  And the U.N.
[01:08:04.298 --> 01:08:05.379]  needs to be shut down!
[01:08:05.699 --> 01:08:08.602]  And China needs to have a military blockade placed on it!
[01:08:09.525 --> 01:08:15.447]  Okay, I was going to take calls, and I'm going to do that a lot this week, but not today, because we have a guest in 30 minutes, and I've got to cover this other news.
[01:08:15.827 --> 01:08:19.888]  But I'm going to go back to what I started the whole first hour with, and I'm going to get back into this right now.
[01:08:19.928 --> 01:08:25.389]  We're going to be posting this video, we found it, to Band.Video in the Band.Video section.
[01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.350]  Okay?
[01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:28.190]  And it's an article out of Town Hall.
[01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.371]  Big Tech removes a video.
[01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:37.752]  From prominent think tank for contradicting WHO on coronavirus, that's Town Hall.
[01:08:38.393 --> 01:08:53.706]  And it's the prestigious Hoover Institute at Stanford University coming out and saying, look, it's a fact coronavirus isn't killing as many people as the UN said.
[01:08:55.408 --> 01:08:58.611]  It's a fact the lockdown is killing massively more people
[01:09:00.965 --> 01:09:04.632]  10, 20, 30 times they said it's immeasurable how bad it is for everybody.
[01:09:06.014 --> 01:09:07.717]  And they just said, nope, you're not allowed to say that.
[01:09:07.837 --> 01:09:09.560]  It is in contravention of the WHO.
[01:09:09.941 --> 01:09:10.281]  It is God.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.364]  So American institutions and top academics don't have their speech anymore.
[01:09:18.104 --> 01:09:18.624]  And the U.N.
[01:09:18.684 --> 01:09:23.348]  is in charge, and big tech can say, it's our right, it's our speech, we take U.N.
[01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:23.628]  orders.
[01:09:24.088 --> 01:09:37.158]  And Congress sits there and fumbles their fingers, twiddles them and says, well, it's a private company, racketeering with the U.N., racketeering with China to suppress an election medal, while the news says Russia's meddling.
[01:09:39.372 --> 01:09:42.014]  Russia has thrown out the Soros Foundation.
[01:09:42.774 --> 01:09:45.736]  Russia doesn't let the United Nations try to overthrow their country.
[01:09:46.257 --> 01:09:49.179]  Russians have free speech, but the UN doesn't.
[01:09:50.099 --> 01:09:53.982]  Because the UN is trying to take our speech, just like Antifa, just like the left.
[01:09:54.844 --> 01:09:59.767]  And the universities have become anti-free speech venues, now launching their attacks out on the rest of the world.
[01:10:00.047 --> 01:10:01.067]  And so what do you expect?
[01:10:01.728 --> 01:10:10.632]  It's all a bunch of people using political correctness to bully everyone, with big mega-corporations backing it to sabotage the West and using our openness to destroy us.
[01:10:12.493 --> 01:10:19.117]  And we let women's groups and minority groups financed by China, financed by the globalists, tell us we're bad and we're not open enough.
[01:10:20.424 --> 01:10:24.007]  And meanwhile, China runs giant slave camps for Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists.
[01:10:24.767 --> 01:10:27.009]  And you don't hear a word out of LeBron James about that.
[01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:45.143]  We have to counter offense and get in the left's face and get in the academics' face and get in these women's groups' faces and challenge them and chastise them for how pathetic and authoritarian they are instead of running from them and bowing to them politically when they tell us they are the lords of how the world should work.
[01:10:46.865 --> 01:10:48.126]  They are the anti-human
[01:10:49.432 --> 01:10:54.195]  Anti-woman, anti-family, anti-prosperity movement.
[01:10:56.256 --> 01:10:58.037]  Just look at these headlines.
[01:10:58.398 --> 01:11:07.003]  Newsome signs bill removing automatic penalty for consensual sex involving minors.
[01:11:07.943 --> 01:11:12.406]  They've changed the laws to give 11-year-olds vaccines and abortions without parental consent.
[01:11:12.766 --> 01:11:17.990]  It's the state coming in to be the mommy and the daddy and now the state's coming in saying you're 14-year-old children
[01:11:19.022 --> 01:11:21.603]  Can have sex with an adult as long as it's same sex.
[01:11:22.963 --> 01:11:24.264]  Wow, what about special rights?
[01:11:24.804 --> 01:11:27.105]  As long as it's a man screwing your son, it's okay.
[01:11:27.685 --> 01:11:30.026]  As long as it's a woman screwing your daughter, it's okay.
[01:11:30.766 --> 01:11:34.388]  This is the weird, sick, twisted logic of these freakazoids.
[01:11:34.728 --> 01:11:42.611]  The same senator in California that got it passed, namesake senator, he got the bill passed two years ago that you can give somebody HIV and not get in trouble.
[01:11:46.772 --> 01:11:48.713]  I mean, these people mean business.
[01:11:52.182 --> 01:11:52.843]  And that's who they are.
[01:11:52.863 --> 01:12:00.331]  They're the same deviants that love pyromania and love seeing the state burned because once they run you out of it, they're just going to buy it all back up.
[01:12:03.034 --> 01:12:12.806]  Republicans call for DOJ to investigate Netflix over Cutie's film with little 10 and 11 year old girls rubbing their genitals on camera with their legs spread to adult men.
[01:12:14.755 --> 01:12:20.279]  Tulsi release of Cuties proves Netflix complicit in child trafficking.
[01:12:20.579 --> 01:12:21.480]  Absolutely.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.621]  Good job for Tulsi Gabbards.
[01:12:25.462 --> 01:12:27.724]  Facebook allows alleged baby rapists to keep account.
[01:12:27.804 --> 01:12:28.985]  Bans Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:12:30.426 --> 01:12:34.588]  Individual has been arrested for videotaping the rape of a six-month-old baby.
[01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:40.773]  In San Marcos, Texas, just south of me.
[01:12:41.833 --> 01:12:43.935]  They're all over the place, but it's okay.
[01:12:44.991 --> 01:12:49.336]  Because the LBGT community is defending him, saying, well, he's gay, and the baby's gay.
[01:12:49.837 --> 01:12:51.278]  The baby identifies as gay.
[01:12:51.378 --> 01:12:52.159]  Gay, gay, gay.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.322]  It's okay, because Tim Cook's gay.
[01:12:54.562 --> 01:12:56.544]  Tim Cook's got death camps, but Tim Cook's gay.
[01:12:57.325 --> 01:12:59.307]  This guy rapes babies, but it's okay, he's gay.
[01:12:59.568 --> 01:13:00.328]  Gay, gay, gay.
[01:13:02.551 --> 01:13:03.332]  Gay, gay, gay.
[01:13:03.352 --> 01:13:05.855]  As long as you're gay, it's okay.
[01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:20.857]  And it goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, because it's spiritual.
[01:13:21.457 --> 01:13:37.385]  These people will go out of their way to destroy the society, the culture, their own businesses, their own children, their own futures, because people like Gavin Newsom, and Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, and Lord Rothschild, and all these people serve evil.
[01:13:43.424 --> 01:13:44.525]  That's what they do.
[01:13:47.526 --> 01:13:48.466]  That's who they are.
[01:13:48.486 --> 01:13:55.590]  And they're making their cultural move.
[01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:58.371]  Now, since I mentioned what's really going on with COVID, let's go through the stat.
[01:13:59.572 --> 01:14:04.094]  Big Tech removes a video from prominent think tank for contradicting the WHO on coronavirus.
[01:14:04.854 --> 01:14:05.034]  Yep.
[01:14:05.795 --> 01:14:10.057]  CNN medical analyst calls indoor Trump rally negligent homicide.
[01:14:10.077 --> 01:14:11.938]  Suggests Trump should shake some hands.
[01:14:13.766 --> 01:14:16.267]  Global COVID-19 cases top 29 million.
[01:14:16.847 --> 01:14:21.569]  WHO reports record jump in cases, not in deaths, because it's a fake test.
[01:14:22.509 --> 01:14:27.411]  Fauci, I'm taking vitamin D supplements to help prevent COVID and vitamin C is good.
[01:14:27.831 --> 01:14:30.712]  He's doing that because he became a laughing stock saying you don't need it, you die without it.
[01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:37.594]  Israel to enter full lockdown, shut schools, close most non-essential businesses from September 18th report.
[01:14:38.195 --> 01:14:40.677]  Netanyahu's using that because he's about to be kicked out of power.
[01:14:40.717 --> 01:14:43.159]  So he's using that as a giant clamp down on martial law.
[01:14:43.199 --> 01:14:43.839]  Shame on Israel.
[01:14:45.721 --> 01:14:47.642]  Stelter, speaking of people that look like pedophiles.
[01:14:49.104 --> 01:14:58.091]  Ask Netflix CEO zero questions about cuties as CNN gives a pass on the film accused of showing child porn for the second time.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.780]  And it goes on and on.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.720]  I can't breathe.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:08.061]  Aussie woman dragged from car in dramatic altercation with police in lockdown.
[01:15:09.261 --> 01:15:17.303]  Police put on extreme display of force in Melbourne beating up anti-lockdown protests but worshipping BLM and Antifa protests because that's their boss.
[01:15:17.343 --> 01:15:18.283]  That's their UN takeover.
[01:15:18.303 --> 01:15:27.265]  And then I love the memes showing all these big health heads, mayors, health department heads around the country who all look like they're dying because they are.
[01:15:28.025 --> 01:15:29.505]  Those are the servants of Soren.
[01:15:30.339 --> 01:15:31.521]  And he is not a good master.
[01:15:34.625 --> 01:15:35.826]  This is the world we live in.
[01:15:36.127 --> 01:15:37.989]  It's like using a hammer to kill a fly.
[01:15:38.389 --> 01:15:47.041]  Architect of Sweden's COVID-19 anti-lockdown strategy finally vindicated lowest COVID-19 deaths and cases in the world because they did nothing.
[01:15:48.404 --> 01:15:53.569]  Police put on extraordinary display, ladies and gentlemen, because they are working for the United Nations.
[01:15:53.609 --> 01:15:56.471]  They don't want you outside of your house.
[01:15:57.432 --> 01:15:58.413]  CDC walks back.
[01:15:58.433 --> 01:16:00.995]  COVID-19 testing warrants not to argue with anti-maskers.
[01:16:03.578 --> 01:16:07.681]  It's far too late to think lockdowns can make COVID-19 go away.
[01:16:07.702 --> 01:16:08.222]  Zero hedge.
[01:16:08.742 --> 01:16:09.063]  It's not.
[01:16:10.208 --> 01:16:18.348]  Meant to go away, ladies and gentlemen, because it says that anybody who's ever had a cold or the flu comes up positive, so you can be taken away to a FEMA camp.
[01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:25.551]  Author of dystopian classics predicted use of face masks to enforce conformity 70 years ago.
[01:16:26.271 --> 01:16:39.215]  Respected German author Ernst Jünger predicted the ubiquitousness of face masks to enforce conformity and uniformity in a dystopian future society in a novel called The Worker that was published nearly 90 years ago.
[01:16:39.235 --> 01:16:44.097]  Read Paul Joseph Watson's article at ZeroEdge or Summit.News or InfoWars.com.
[01:16:45.882 --> 01:16:46.622]  Big studies out.
[01:16:46.963 --> 01:16:51.125]  Most Americans distrust experts now because they believe they're being lied to because they know they are.
[01:16:53.547 --> 01:16:58.130]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:06.355]  All right, when we come back, I'll tell you what we're going to get to when we come back because there's a lot I'm going to be covering.
[01:17:06.596 --> 01:17:08.977]  But I'm going to be loading for bear coming up next segment.
[01:17:08.997 --> 01:17:10.978]  I'm going to talk about solutions as well.
[01:17:11.479 --> 01:17:14.381]  And then we have a special guest joining us from London, England.
[01:17:15.862 --> 01:17:17.503]  Brian Rose, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:21.346]  Remember how we defeat Fauci and Bill Gates and all the rest of the scum?
[01:17:21.726 --> 01:17:25.208]  You tell folks how to tune into this show, and you do it every time you see somebody.
[01:17:25.448 --> 01:17:26.549]  It'll change the world.
[01:17:29.191 --> 01:17:34.574]  In 100 years, it's already killed nearly 200,000 people and counting.
[01:17:35.775 --> 01:17:42.800]  The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression has cost tens of millions of American jobs and counting.
[01:17:44.611 --> 01:17:51.516]  Emboldened white supremacy unseen since the 60s and a reckoning on race that's long overdue.
[01:17:53.057 --> 01:18:06.907]  And undeniable acceleration of the punishing reality of climate change on our planet and our people, on the lives and livelihoods which I'd like to talk about now.
[01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:30.810]  Jill and I continue, as I suspect all of you do, is pray for everyone in California, Oregon, and Washington, and across the West, as these devastating wildfires rage on, just as we hold them in our hearts, those who have faced the hurricanes, tropical storms off our coast of Florida, North Carolina, or like parts of New Orleans.
[01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:33.952]  And he goes on, that was just minutes ago, to blame it on climate change.
[01:18:35.199 --> 01:18:39.081]  I guess the Spanish Armada that tried to invade England 500 years ago, that was climate change?
[01:18:39.702 --> 01:18:41.683]  When the hurricane sunk all the ships?
[01:18:43.224 --> 01:18:54.090]  Or when the Chinese had an armada about to invade Japan and the Kamikaze, the Divine Wind, they named Kamikaze planes after later, sunk over a thousand Chinese ships, was that climate change?
[01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:56.691]  Or volcanoes blow up, is that climate change?
[01:18:57.172 --> 01:19:04.276]  They sit there and point at everything that says climate change, when in truth it has been a change to the topography, they wouldn't let the firebreaks be put in.
[01:19:05.359 --> 01:19:07.901]  And all the forest managers at the time said, you're crazy.
[01:19:08.781 --> 01:19:17.527]  Whether you're in South America, or whether you're in China, or whether you're in ancient Europe, or ancient Rome, or ancient anywhere there was people, they would do firebreaks.
[01:19:20.109 --> 01:19:21.910]  Unbelievable.
[01:19:23.932 --> 01:19:27.354]  Where do you think the practice of having a yard around your house came from if you live in the woods?
[01:19:27.694 --> 01:19:28.275]  It's a firebreak.
[01:19:29.991 --> 01:19:35.616]  That's why a lot of old houses you see built out in the middle of nowhere will have like a wall of dirt built up around them.
[01:19:36.176 --> 01:19:37.157]  It's about four feet tall.
[01:19:37.177 --> 01:19:38.358]  You can walk right over it, buddy.
[01:19:38.398 --> 01:19:39.258]  It's meant to stop fire.
[01:19:39.679 --> 01:19:41.160]  This is all stuff humans did.
[01:19:42.621 --> 01:19:43.662]  We've been taken off the land.
[01:19:43.702 --> 01:19:52.889]  We've been so domesticated by these people that folks think it's voodoo when you tell them you die without vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc.
[01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:55.672]  Or if you live by a forest,
[01:19:56.789 --> 01:19:59.871]  You better trim the trees back 30 yards from your house.
[01:20:03.694 --> 01:20:07.877]  Because lightning strikes it in a dry part of the time, you're gonna burn.
[01:20:08.857 --> 01:20:18.885]  And again, I know for listeners, you know all this, but man, you think I was happy this morning when I got up and I saw Fauci going, you can take vitamin C and D, you do need it, especially if you're deficient.
[01:20:19.185 --> 01:20:20.426]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:20:20.786 --> 01:20:23.628]  You do need water, especially if you're dehydrated.
[01:20:26.109 --> 01:20:28.251]  Again, this is one of those things like two plus two equals four.
[01:20:29.612 --> 01:20:31.713]  We need Fauci to talk to us like we're two-year-olds.
[01:20:33.915 --> 01:20:40.600]  And again, he said six months ago, no, D3, C, none of it helps you.
[01:20:42.181 --> 01:20:52.409]  And there was such a revolt about zinc, that's what hydroxychloroquine does, is make zinc go into your cells, that now he has to come out and say, okay, you need it.
[01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:55.472]  It's such an insult to our intelligence.
[01:20:56.567 --> 01:21:15.286]  And I've got hundreds of articles to cover, but I mean, I think I'm gonna do a special news piece about this, because in Texas, in Michigan, other states, the FBI raided medical doctors that were preventatively prescribing vitamin C. And you've heard medical doctors call in, we've had them on as guests, who try to get insurance to pay for
[01:21:16.368 --> 01:21:18.249]  A nice medical-grade multivitamin.
[01:21:18.949 --> 01:21:25.193]  And they're like, no, that's no longer available on insurance, even though in the past doctors could always prescribe a multivitamin.
[01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.913]  A lot of doctors make money off selling them themselves.
[01:21:28.034 --> 01:21:30.095]  Because the UN said no.
[01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.556]  And look, I've got hundreds of articles.
[01:21:33.997 --> 01:21:34.818]  Hundreds of clips.
[01:21:36.799 --> 01:21:39.320]  But I'm going to just keep saying this, because this is everything.
[01:21:44.187 --> 01:21:59.491]  Facebook and Twitter and Google and all of them will not let you link to ABC, CBS, NBC, local sheriff's departments arresting people on video with Moloff cocktails and gas cans setting fires in Oregon and California.
[01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:02.032]  We showed them last hour.
[01:22:04.032 --> 01:22:11.554]  Because they said that that is not allowed according to the Southern Poverty Law Center that controls their policy.
[01:22:12.489 --> 01:22:25.035]  So it's not just you can't have Stanford University come out and say COVID has been overblown and that the lockdown's killing more people and the UN says shut it down and it shut down.
[01:22:25.435 --> 01:22:40.043]  Now, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL say, you know what, we're gonna blame this on climate change, we're gonna make this political, and Biden's gonna come out and say this, so we're not gonna let you know they're arresting all these arsonists that work for them!
[01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:48.056]  So they set the policies through the UN and UNESCO, going back to the 70s, to not cut firebreaks worldwide.
[01:22:48.256 --> 01:22:49.557]  Most countries just ignore the UN.
[01:22:50.158 --> 01:22:57.044]  But blue cities and blue states follow the rule, don't cut firebreaks, record fires come back, and then they blame you and say it's your fault.
[01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:04.531]  So again, I'm going to explain this.
[01:23:04.551 --> 01:23:07.112]  My parents bought four acres here in town back in the 90s.
[01:23:27.705 --> 01:23:34.911]  The year I graduated high school, like back in like 92, my dad bought this house for like $85,000 and four acres.
[01:23:34.951 --> 01:23:41.016]  Now it's worth like, you know, way more than that because of everybody moving to Texas, but he's been offered millions for it.
[01:23:41.036 --> 01:23:52.886]  But the point I'm getting at is they built a pool on it 10 years ago and they came and harassed them and put tags on every tree and wouldn't let them cut down two inch round trees.
[01:23:58.595 --> 01:24:05.559]  And I know people in Austin that have bought houses, and they cut down a cedar tree that's an invasive species in their backyard, and the city comes out and gives them $5,000 fines.
[01:24:05.699 --> 01:24:08.580]  I have a friend that happened to last two months ago.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.122]  $5,000 fine for an ugly cedar tree.
[01:24:11.322 --> 01:24:14.903]  The neighbors saw them cut it, and here came the city code enforcers.
[01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:16.884]  So that's what this is, okay?
[01:24:18.145 --> 01:24:25.349]  And if there's ever a forest fire where my dad lives, because it's woods, his house will burn down.
[01:24:28.325 --> 01:24:31.546]  Because they won't let them cut any of the trees.
[01:24:31.706 --> 01:24:35.708]  Or they can pay thousands of dollars, depending on how big a round it is.
[01:24:35.768 --> 01:24:37.989]  I mean, a four-inch-round tree is like five grand.
[01:24:42.331 --> 01:24:43.652]  And so imagine that.
[01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:47.093]  It has nothing to do with forestry.
[01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:48.674]  It has nothing to do with replanting trees.
[01:24:48.714 --> 01:24:51.175]  We have more trees here than we had before the white man came here.
[01:24:51.215 --> 01:24:51.675]  Look that up.
[01:24:52.415 --> 01:24:53.676]  We got more forests than we ever had.
[01:24:57.045 --> 01:25:00.387]  And so the answer is getting back to the land and learning how things work.
[01:25:00.407 --> 01:25:04.890]  Remember Trump famously said, well, aren't you supposed to rake the forest?
[01:25:07.152 --> 01:25:14.136]  Because at his golf courses, that's what the Scots, and he hired a bunch of Scot folks to run his golf courses.
[01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:15.597]  They're some of the best where golf started.
[01:25:16.218 --> 01:25:18.379]  They call it raking the forest in Scotland.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.601]  They call it raking the forest in Germany.
[01:25:20.621 --> 01:25:25.064]  That's a term where you don't just cut down dead wood and move it, you rake it.
[01:25:26.331 --> 01:25:29.274]  So you go to Europe in areas, man, it's so well kept.
[01:25:29.294 --> 01:25:36.221]  You go into a forest, there's nothing on the ground because all that wood has value to be wood chipped, to be turned into starter logs.
[01:25:36.442 --> 01:25:37.082]  It's valuable.
[01:25:39.245 --> 01:25:45.171]  And they have the local foresters that make a living off that, and they go out and they rake the forests.
[01:25:46.092 --> 01:25:48.014]  Yeah, they Googled the term and found it right there.
[01:25:50.325 --> 01:25:52.406]  And you build paths that are natural firebreaks.
[01:25:52.466 --> 01:25:55.387]  It's called stewardship of the land.
[01:25:55.988 --> 01:26:04.151]  Now, I said I'd get to solutions this segment, and I went too far on that whole issue, but... Folks, we've woken up inside this tyranny, and it's time to stop it.
[01:26:06.933 --> 01:26:07.733]  It's time to end it.
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:12.160]  Epic.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:15.141]  Massive Latinos for Trump Caravan underway in Miami.
[01:26:15.181 --> 01:26:16.201]  More than 4,000 vehicles.
[01:26:16.481 --> 01:26:17.321]  They try to lock you up.
[01:26:17.341 --> 01:26:18.862]  They try to say you can't do what that... No.
[01:26:19.142 --> 01:26:19.942]  Have caravans.
[01:26:20.202 --> 01:26:21.102]  Have boat events.
[01:26:21.422 --> 01:26:22.982]  Go hang banners from roadsides.
[01:26:23.463 --> 01:26:24.883]  One person can do incredible things.
[01:26:24.923 --> 01:26:28.044]  Whatever you do, reach 10 people, 100 people, 1,000 people.
[01:26:28.344 --> 01:26:29.304]  Call the talk radio.
[01:26:30.604 --> 01:26:32.064]  Send out the links to this live show.
[01:26:32.124 --> 01:26:36.025]  Whatever you do, find the most effective, truthful media and get it out there.
[01:26:36.045 --> 01:26:38.966]  Whether it's you or somebody else that you say speaks for you.
[01:26:40.811 --> 01:26:55.345]  And that's all I try to do is find all these other great people like Brian Rose coming up, who was reaching millions a week, now he reaches millions a day, and to try to boost what they're doing, and hopefully they boost what we're doing, and together we can override this tyranny.
[01:26:56.807 --> 01:26:57.627]  Momentum, Trump!
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.442]  Well, Hayden Biden took another weekend off.
[01:27:00.462 --> 01:27:11.637]  President Trump spoke to 25,000 followers in Nevada, and CNN said he's a murderer for doing it because somebody will die from COVID, and they're waiting for somebody to die of the flu or the cold out of that 25,000 and say it's COVID.
[01:27:12.158 --> 01:27:13.119]  But they don't say a word.
[01:27:13.179 --> 01:27:15.502]  Actually, they do say a word.
[01:27:15.542 --> 01:27:16.003]  I'm sorry.
[01:27:17.674 --> 01:27:24.156]  They had all those millions marching in Black Lives Matter and they had a fake study out saying it actually lowers COVID to March when it's for Black Lives Matter.
[01:27:24.256 --> 01:27:24.997]  What a fraud.
[01:27:25.577 --> 01:27:27.277]  Does George Soros really represent black people?
[01:27:27.337 --> 01:27:27.517]  No.
[01:27:27.898 --> 01:27:29.758]  But his movement is called Black Lives Matter.
[01:27:30.038 --> 01:27:31.379]  He uses black people as a shield.
[01:27:32.399 --> 01:27:35.500]  We'll be right back with Brian Rose and a whole raft of issues.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:41.863]  5G, forced inoculations, media censorship, the global awakening, how to fight back, a lot of positive news.
[01:27:42.563 --> 01:27:43.003]  Next hour.
[01:27:43.023 --> 01:27:45.604]  All right, we're back.
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:49.089]  Brian Rose is going to be covering the waterfront with us.
[01:27:50.745 --> 01:27:53.746]  Coming up next segment, I've also got a really crazy piece of news here.
[01:27:54.326 --> 01:28:01.108]  We hired a well-known statistician to do a bunch of breakdowns of national and local COVID-19 cases.
[01:28:01.148 --> 01:28:08.770]  Obviously, we didn't say his name, if anybody involved in real COVID research gets blackballed, gets demonized, because the UN doesn't allow private science and research in America anymore.
[01:28:09.130 --> 01:28:13.551]  Just ask Stanford Research Institute, Stanford University, and the Hoover Institute.
[01:28:13.571 --> 01:28:17.872]  They just got banned on YouTube for saying that the UN lied about COVID and exaggerated it.
[01:28:17.912 --> 01:28:18.633]  You're not allowed to do that.
[01:28:20.896 --> 01:28:22.337]  I don't even know what headline to give this.
[01:28:22.377 --> 01:28:25.599]  I'm not saying it's a bad headline that the crew came up with.
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.200]  I'm trying to read these latest statistics.
[01:28:29.501 --> 01:28:37.765]  It says, weird, Texas reports massive drops in active COVID cases despite consistent uptrend in total cases.
[01:28:38.465 --> 01:28:39.806]  So people aren't actually sick.
[01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:42.247]  They're actually being treated, but the cases are way up.
[01:28:42.287 --> 01:28:44.208]  Yeah, because they're using fake tests.
[01:28:44.248 --> 01:28:45.089]  That's what's going on there.
[01:28:45.409 --> 01:28:46.350]  Very interesting article.
[01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:48.471]  Brian Rose is coming up, but I want to air
[01:28:49.707 --> 01:28:55.128]  This short little special report, or at least part of it, the Netflix cuties debacle that John Bowne did.
[01:28:55.168 --> 01:28:57.228]  Here's the Netflix cutie debacle.
[01:28:57.588 --> 01:29:00.109]  The full video is in the John Bowne section at Banned.Video.
[01:29:00.369 --> 01:29:00.809]  Here it is.
[01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:05.070]  Netflix's cuties debacle continues to escalate.
[01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:16.772]  Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, and Mike Lee have called on the DOJ to investigate Netflix over the blatant celebration of softcore child pornography, while Democrat outcasts
[01:29:16.912 --> 01:29:26.218]  Tulsi Gabbard said, Netflix child porn cuties will certainly whet the appetite of pedophiles and help fuel the child sex trafficking trade.
[01:29:26.578 --> 01:29:29.380]  One in four victims of trafficking are children.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.922]  It happened to my friend's 13-year-old daughter.
[01:29:32.142 --> 01:29:34.364]  Netflix, you are now complicit.
[01:29:34.564 --> 01:29:36.645]  Hashtag cancel Netflix.
[01:29:36.985 --> 01:29:45.471]  The French production received an 89% favorable Rotten Tomatoes movie critics rating, while actual moral people
[01:29:45.771 --> 01:29:49.614]  gave it a 3% favorable audience rating.
[01:29:49.774 --> 01:29:54.558]  In 2019, Cuties premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.
[01:29:54.698 --> 01:30:03.444]  That same year, Variety reported Sterling Van Wagenen, who co-founded the Sundance Film Festival with Robert Redford in 1978, was sentenced to at least
[01:30:05.826 --> 01:30:14.328]  Six years in prison after pleading guilty to sexual abuse of a child that began when that child was just seven years old.
[01:30:14.508 --> 01:30:28.572]  Publications like The Verge, Variety, and Salon, along with the director of the film, blamed the Netflix poster for all of the outrage, rather than the blatant sexualization of underage children throughout the film.
[01:30:28.792 --> 01:30:48.607]  The Verge even attempts to blame Alex Jones, Steven Crowder, and QAnon for some kind of misguided backlash, claiming not all of the criticism came from people who openly support QAnon, but the backlash makes Cuties an easy target for QAnon supporters to spread conspiracy theories.
[01:30:48.807 --> 01:30:51.589]  The focus has shifted away from the actual movie,
[01:30:51.749 --> 01:30:57.870]  Including its purpose and contextual uses of certain scenes because of the resurgent backlash.
[01:30:58.010 --> 01:31:09.213]  But as a critic wrote in his Rolling Stone review, Cuties is not a salacious bit of pedo-bait designed to appeal to baser instincts rather than better angels.
[01:31:09.553 --> 01:31:14.414]  But the film that gets progressively suggestive in its sexual exploitation
[01:31:14.594 --> 01:31:19.477]  And comes across as softcore pedophilia, only has itself to blame.
[01:31:19.697 --> 01:31:31.624]  The Daily Wire interviewed sex trafficking survivor and advocate Eliza Blue, who said the film is also giving sexual abuse victims flashbacks of some of the darkest moments of their lives.
[01:31:31.984 --> 01:31:37.407]  She said it takes them back to a moment when they were abused and overtly sexualized as a child.
[01:31:37.647 --> 01:31:39.428]  They might have thoughts of suicide.
[01:31:39.568 --> 01:31:45.332]  Those are the real-life ramifications of that material being so open and readily available.
[01:31:45.493 --> 01:31:48.675]  This isn't the first time Netflix has crossed the line.
[01:31:48.775 --> 01:31:54.560]  The Netflix cartoon Big Mouth is nauseating in its promotion and normalization of pedophilia.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:04.047]  The film Girl, about a teenage male ballerina who identifies as female on Netflix, received condemnation after showing frontal nudity
[01:32:04.087 --> 01:32:05.929]  Should consuming child porn be legal?
[01:32:06.049 --> 01:32:09.053]  I think that that would be, yes, more legal and more ethically consistent.
[01:32:09.073 --> 01:32:09.173]  Yes, 100%.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.882]  This is going to come down to sight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[01:32:32.902 --> 01:32:34.042]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:32:34.062 --> 01:32:35.623]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[01:32:35.803 --> 01:32:37.164]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[01:32:37.284 --> 01:32:38.304]  I want them shut down.
[01:32:38.364 --> 01:32:39.265]  I want them silenced.
[01:32:39.325 --> 01:32:40.125]  I want them muted.
[01:32:40.165 --> 01:32:41.946]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:32:41.966 --> 01:32:42.907]  You kept us on air.
[01:32:43.027 --> 01:32:44.327]  We did the analysis first.
[01:32:44.607 --> 01:32:45.608]  It's now gone mainstream.
[01:32:45.668 --> 01:32:47.469]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[01:32:47.749 --> 01:32:53.652]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[01:32:54.212 --> 01:32:55.314]  You need to stop right now.
[01:32:55.394 --> 01:32:56.475]  And they're very, very serious.
[01:32:56.595 --> 01:32:58.978]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[01:32:59.078 --> 01:32:59.779]  It's not gonna happen.
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.862]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[01:33:02.303 --> 01:33:04.746]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[01:33:04.846 --> 01:33:06.488]  Save yourself, save the world.
[01:33:06.789 --> 01:33:07.650]  We're in this together.
[01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:08.751]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:33:09.412 --> 01:33:10.393]  Communism's up here.
[01:33:10.593 --> 01:33:13.537]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[01:33:13.957 --> 01:33:15.939]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[01:33:15.979 --> 01:33:17.521]  My children are right here!
[01:33:18.242 --> 01:33:19.984]  But I need money to fight a war!
[01:33:20.204 --> 01:33:21.245]  And I need word of mouth!
[01:33:21.465 --> 01:33:22.366]  And I need prayer!
[01:33:22.506 --> 01:33:23.468]  And I need action!
[01:33:23.828 --> 01:33:25.430]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[01:33:26.150 --> 01:33:28.113]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[01:33:28.902 --> 01:33:30.062]  This perfect storm.
[01:33:30.563 --> 01:33:33.143]  The debate is over around climate change.
[01:33:33.703 --> 01:33:36.084]  Just come to the state of California.
[01:33:36.684 --> 01:33:38.205]  Observe it with your own eyes.
[01:33:38.305 --> 01:33:39.545]  It's not an intellectual debate.
[01:33:39.585 --> 01:33:41.386]  It's not even debatable.
[01:33:41.566 --> 01:33:44.707]  The debate is over around climate change.
[01:33:45.902 --> 01:33:51.246]  California's rogue governor says the fires are due to climate change.
[01:33:51.987 --> 01:33:57.392]  But anyone with a modicum of awareness knows that this is an outrageous lie.
[01:33:58.633 --> 01:34:02.035]  We know exactly what causes the California wildfire.
[01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:06.960]  It is the result of two factors, dry seasons and people.
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:16.270]  Official state records have only been kept since the 1950s, and 2020 has been the most destructive season on record.
[01:34:17.091 --> 01:34:23.519]  But this isn't a new phenomenon, and the fires of the past were more destructive than the modern era.
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:39.029]  Through studies of tree rings and other natural evidence, researchers have documented multiple droughts in California during the past thousand years, including one that began in the year 850, which lasted two and a half centuries.
[01:34:40.110 --> 01:34:50.396]  Before European settlers arrived in California, indigenous peoples used controlled burns to manage the dry season and to increase and improve their harvest.
[01:34:51.136 --> 01:34:55.939]  It is estimated they would burn 4.4 million acres of forest each year.
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:58.240]  And that is twice as much as 2020.
[01:34:59.910 --> 01:35:05.215]  Studies have shown that 97% of all forest fires are caused by humans.
[01:35:05.896 --> 01:35:10.360]  Smoking, campfires, and other accidents have always been a problem.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:17.046]  Experts blame the recent wildfires on fire suppression and an overabundance of wood fuel.
[01:35:17.807 --> 01:35:22.971]  One of the reasons why the indigenous people burned so much forest was to keep this under control.
[01:35:24.433 --> 01:35:27.875]  Aside from human accidents, there is also arson.
[01:35:28.616 --> 01:35:30.978]  And we have seen plenty of arson in 2020.
[01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:33.720]  It's been sort of the theme.
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:40.205]  If this country doesn't give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it.
[01:35:40.885 --> 01:35:45.089]  Several people have been arrested for starting fires along the entire West Coast.
[01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:48.853]  Homeowners are catching arsonists on their property.
[01:35:49.974 --> 01:35:55.299]  There are reports of people throwing Molotov cocktails out of moving vehicles on the freeway.
[01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:07.307]  And there are videos of arsonists setting people's homes on fire.
[01:36:08.548 --> 01:36:15.772]  We know for certain that at least one of the arrested arsonists is directly involved with the BLM Antifa movement.
[01:36:17.012 --> 01:36:20.254]  And the rest certainly seem to fit the bill.
[01:36:23.155 --> 01:36:24.797]  Local news is reporting on it.
[01:36:24.817 --> 01:36:28.100]  A man has been arrested accused of starting this fire.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:32.785]  One of two men accused of intentionally setting fire to fields along freeways.
[01:36:32.985 --> 01:36:36.709]  But the FBI and the mainstream media are in full denial.
[01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:46.018]  A Clackamas County Sheriff's deputy was placed on administrative leave after warning locals about coordinated arson attacks.
[01:36:46.178 --> 01:36:49.563]  What I'm worried about is that there's people stashing stuff, right?
[01:36:49.583 --> 01:36:49.823]  Right.
[01:36:50.064 --> 01:36:53.208]  It means that they're going to go in preparation, right?
[01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:57.394]  And I don't want to sound like some doomsdayer, but it's getting serious.
[01:36:58.024 --> 01:37:01.907]  And the Democrat Party is telling you it is all climate change.
[01:37:02.067 --> 01:37:03.848]  Mother Earth is angry.
[01:37:03.868 --> 01:37:14.256]  She's telling us, whether she's telling us with hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, fires in the West, whatever it is, that the climate crisis is real and has an impact.
[01:37:14.617 --> 01:37:20.961]  And telling you that the fires will soon come to your town if you don't vote for climate change.
[01:37:21.382 --> 01:37:22.783]  What we're experiencing right here
[01:37:23.763 --> 01:37:30.308]  Is coming to community all across the United States of America unless we get our act together on climate change.
[01:37:30.548 --> 01:37:39.776]  Which is a pretty nasty threat considering how many cities across America have burned by the hands of radical leftists over the summer.
[01:37:41.564 --> 01:38:01.034]  The 2006 film Apocalypto beautifully illustrated how the ancient Mayans' advanced knowledge of astronomy could have been used to frighten the superstitious masses into offering their own to be sacrificed on the altar of false idols who had the power to blacken out the sun.
[01:38:02.454 --> 01:38:04.636]  And there is nothing new under the sun.
[01:38:05.276 --> 01:38:12.861]  People today will throw away their children's birthright because of ignorance, faith in false idols, and their blatant lies.
[01:38:14.082 --> 01:38:16.443]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:38:20.866 --> 01:38:25.289]  I don't normally air something twice in one show, but I've aired that three times today.
[01:38:27.105 --> 01:38:31.911]  It's at band.video, it's at 2020electioncenter.com, under the title Arsonist.
[01:38:33.433 --> 01:38:38.259]  Agents to the left set fire to the West Coast as Democrat leaders blame climate change.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.764]  Well, we're joined by Brian Rose for the rest of the hour, LondonReal.tv.
[01:38:44.364 --> 01:38:46.566]  He was a successful banker in Wall Street, the city of London.
[01:38:47.026 --> 01:38:50.049]  Then he got, didn't like what was going on, wasn't happy, started London Real.
[01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:54.333]  He's a self-help guy, a business leader, does a lot of other great stuff.
[01:38:54.873 --> 01:38:57.135]  And now he reaches millions and millions of people every week.
[01:38:57.715 --> 01:39:06.182]  And he's also doing something that's so critical to all of us, migrating away from big tech, building his own independent system that now reaches millions of people every week.
[01:39:06.983 --> 01:39:10.826]  And he's been having these big, huge David Icke interviews, so many other big interviews.
[01:39:10.867 --> 01:39:19.754]  He just hosted the film, Pandemic, Indoctrination, World Premiere, and we're going to be talking about some of that as well coming up.
[01:39:19.794 --> 01:39:21.175]  Bottom of the hour, we'll play you that trailer.
[01:39:21.656 --> 01:39:26.140]  I'm told the Pandemic folks are going to be in here on the David Knight Show later this week here in Austin, Texas.
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.903]  So, so much to get into, but you know,
[01:39:30.299 --> 01:39:36.145]  I like Brian Rose at LondonReal.tv because he's a positive guy and I need that.
[01:39:36.265 --> 01:39:50.079]  I need to be reminded that it's negative to learn about all this stuff, it's negative to know about it, but the enemy is striking back so much harder right now because we are uncovering them and making them fight for their very globalist political lives.
[01:39:51.135 --> 01:39:53.056]  And so their system is coming down.
[01:39:53.076 --> 01:39:54.837]  Their whole pedophile global networks.
[01:39:55.677 --> 01:39:57.838]  Their whole, you know, COVID exaggeration.
[01:39:58.198 --> 01:40:00.419]  COVID power grab is going down.
[01:40:00.939 --> 01:40:02.280]  Their whole world government's going down.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.321]  Peace is breaking out all over the world.
[01:40:04.381 --> 01:40:05.481]  Humanity's coming together.
[01:40:05.741 --> 01:40:09.283]  So there's a lot of negative happening, but there's also a lot of positive happening.
[01:40:09.323 --> 01:40:10.563]  So Brian, thanks for joining us.
[01:40:10.903 --> 01:40:14.305]  In the three or four minutes we have left from break, I just want to commend your great work and salute you, my friend.
[01:40:16.047 --> 01:40:24.652]  Alex, thanks so much for having me back and you know, you said it, you know, I started London Real nine years ago as a platform for free speech, real conversations with real people.
[01:40:25.313 --> 01:40:34.358]  And, you know, it wasn't until six months ago when we had the broadcast of the second largest YouTube live stream in the world that was going to go on to be watched 30 or 40 million times.
[01:40:34.418 --> 01:40:35.519]  It was an episode with David Icke.
[01:40:35.579 --> 01:40:36.620]  It was going to be watched kind of
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:45.903]  The kind of numbers that you see when Alex Jones goes on Joe Rogan, one of those big episodes, and yet 30 minutes later they banned us and deleted us and we just decided to fight back.
[01:40:46.103 --> 01:41:01.629]  So we decided to create our own platform called the Digital Freedom Platform and as of today we raised over one and a half million dollars from 38,000 digital freedom fighters from around the world and they encourage us to stream uncensored, unedited, unscripted,
[01:41:02.249 --> 01:41:09.270]  And we went ahead and did that and had incredible conversations with people like Candace Owens and Dennis Prager and Robert Kennedy, Nobel Prize winners.
[01:41:09.670 --> 01:41:16.371]  And the big one we just did was we broke the record for the largest live stream of a documentary film with Plandemic.
[01:41:16.411 --> 01:41:20.452]  We had the exclusive world premiere, 1.98 million unique people.
[01:41:21.072 --> 01:41:22.332]  It was a real success, Alex.
[01:41:22.372 --> 01:41:24.373]  But I'm not here to tell you everything's rosy.
[01:41:24.713 --> 01:41:25.353]  It's difficult.
[01:41:25.393 --> 01:41:28.793]  We're being attacked by the mainstream media, Vice Magazine, The Telegraph.
[01:41:29.114 --> 01:41:31.454]  We've been completely deplatformed now from LinkedIn.
[01:41:32.134 --> 01:41:35.098]  Facebook banned our URL, freedomplatform.tv.
[01:41:35.819 --> 01:41:42.206]  I'm getting content removed by Spotify, and I've got troll armies attacking me, malicious attacks every single day.
[01:41:42.627 --> 01:41:46.452]  But the funny thing is, Alex, when I go out onto the streets of London and I speak with real people,
[01:41:47.032 --> 01:41:48.654]  I've got a hundred percent approval rating.
[01:41:48.914 --> 01:41:49.935]  They love what we're doing.
[01:41:49.995 --> 01:41:50.335]  Exactly.
[01:41:50.355 --> 01:41:51.516]  They love this voice of the people.
[01:41:51.536 --> 01:41:55.680]  So I'm optimistic, Alex, in the face of fear and the face of oppression.
[01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:59.903]  But that means we got to keep getting these messages out here like you do on InfoWars.
[01:41:59.983 --> 01:42:03.066]  And, you know, we're just trying to broadcast this stuff because the people want it.
[01:42:03.386 --> 01:42:07.530]  Well, what I admire about you, and I've seen your work for, I've probably been aware of it six, seven years.
[01:42:09.477 --> 01:42:10.537]  Is that you're not a coward.
[01:42:10.977 --> 01:42:14.898]  And in this day and age that, you know, for prominent people, that's rare.
[01:42:15.238 --> 01:42:20.299]  Most people want to play it safe, and they started to censor you, trying to block you for doing game-changing viral videos.
[01:42:20.799 --> 01:42:21.559]  You didn't back down.
[01:42:21.599 --> 01:42:25.040]  You intensified what you were doing, and you've been successful fighting back, though it's been a fight.
[01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:27.080]  And so that's, that's the essence.
[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:36.242]  If more people did what Alex Jones has done, or what David Icke has done, or what a Brian Rose has done, we wouldn't be in this situation with so many followers and with big tech doing what they're doing.
[01:42:36.442 --> 01:42:37.982]  I mean, have you heard about, and we'll talk about this when we come back,
[01:42:39.045 --> 01:42:48.777]  Now Stanford University and the Hoover Institute's being censored by Google because the UN doesn't like top scientists saying COVID is overblown.
[01:42:49.217 --> 01:42:53.443]  I mean, and the Hoover Institute's calling it terrifying, dangerous, authoritarian.
[01:42:55.256 --> 01:42:56.017]  Yeah, no, it's true.
[01:42:56.057 --> 01:42:58.040]  I mean, everyone is locking us down right now.
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:03.807]  And, you know, YouTube came after me for what we did on Plandemic, not even on their platform.
[01:43:04.068 --> 01:43:10.036]  So just by me talking about it on the YouTube platform, they came after us and... You know why they came after you?
[01:43:10.096 --> 01:43:11.217]  Because you're telling the truth.
[01:43:11.277 --> 01:43:11.718]  Stay there.
[01:43:11.738 --> 01:43:12.880]  Brian Rose is our guest.
[01:43:14.690 --> 01:43:18.693]  Brian Rose is our guest for the rest of the hour, then Gerald Cilente takes over.
[01:43:18.713 --> 01:43:24.577]  We've got some good news next segment on the whole plandemic, scamdemic situation.
[01:43:24.597 --> 01:43:31.902]  We'll be covering and playing some clips from the new film, Plandemic, that you can find that premiered over at LondonReal.tv.
[01:43:31.942 --> 01:43:35.445]  But first, since I mentioned the good news, here it is.
[01:43:36.105 --> 01:43:40.609]  Pennsylvania judge rules the governor and the bizarre
[01:43:41.894 --> 01:43:45.496]  Health Director, shutdown is unconstitutional.
[01:43:46.476 --> 01:43:51.579]  That's one of the same governors that sent sick people into nursing homes so they could actually get some dead.
[01:43:51.599 --> 01:43:53.760]  Talk about monsters, they're it.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.042]  But going back to Brian Rose of London Real.
[01:43:58.082 --> 01:44:00.043]  Brian, you got cut off by the break, cut off by me.
[01:44:00.403 --> 01:44:03.565]  You were getting into the gauntlet you've gone through and what that experience is like.
[01:44:04.386 --> 01:44:10.736]  But it seems overall to be empowering, and as you said, when you go out on the street, it's like Fight Club, because I experienced it myself.
[01:44:11.117 --> 01:44:15.123]  The number of people that are awake, it's got to be bigger than even the numbers we're seeing.
[01:44:15.464 --> 01:44:18.389]  The way this stuff bounces around and gets shared, something big is happening.
[01:44:20.083 --> 01:44:22.566]  Yeah, I mean, I bump into people all the time on the street.
[01:44:22.626 --> 01:44:28.633]  Sometimes I just shoot videos with them and put them on the social platforms that I have left, and they just blow up, Alex.
[01:44:28.653 --> 01:44:30.455]  You know, 50, 100,000 views.
[01:44:30.955 --> 01:44:35.000]  People really like to see real people having real conversations, and they know what's going on.
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:37.263]  They're sharing this content behind the scenes.
[01:44:37.603 --> 01:44:39.265]  They're trying to get other people to wake up.
[01:44:39.885 --> 01:44:42.609]  And, you know, right now I'm looking for solutions.
[01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:49.937]  You know, I'm kind of done complaining and I'm looking forward and I'm looking at the leadership, especially here in London, and there's just a complete lack of it.
[01:44:50.898 --> 01:44:52.980]  People are not using a science-based approach.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:55.423]  There's been a completely disproportionate response.
[01:44:55.803 --> 01:44:59.926]  The people want some answers and quite frankly, Alex, we need to get London back to work.
[01:45:00.006 --> 01:45:06.770]  I know you were working on this in Austin, but here, a shocking 13% of people are actually coming to the office in London.
[01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:07.571]  It's one of the worst.
[01:45:08.071 --> 01:45:09.472]  And I don't know what the mayor is up to.
[01:45:09.572 --> 01:45:11.773]  He seems to be whining and complaining most of the time.
[01:45:12.214 --> 01:45:15.656]  But I've been meeting with entrepreneurs and trying to find out how we can find solutions.
[01:45:16.056 --> 01:45:20.342]  Because I think you know this Alex, the economy is really one of the most important things.
[01:45:20.663 --> 01:45:23.086]  Some of these businesses are going bankrupt forever.
[01:45:23.306 --> 01:45:26.371]  They will never come back and that leads to mental health, physical health.
[01:45:26.771 --> 01:45:31.498]  So that's something I've been really focusing on the last couple weeks and I'm gonna really push this agenda going forward.
[01:45:31.618 --> 01:45:34.461]  Well, since you mentioned that, I mean, you have been a successful businessman and a banker.
[01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:43.931]  I know our listeners are smart and informed, but for those that are tuning in on radio stations, TV stations that have never heard the show, or maybe it's the second time they've seen it, we're not fear-mongering.
[01:45:43.951 --> 01:45:48.696]  We explain that the way society works in civilization and supply chains, that the already eight months
[01:45:49.216 --> 01:45:58.222]  ...of lockdown we've seen is already starving millions, the UN admits that, and causing irrevocable damage to savings and infrastructure that is going to be seen for decades to come.
[01:45:58.723 --> 01:45:59.963]  And this is the global reset.
[01:46:00.264 --> 01:46:05.027]  The UN and Davos admit they're doing this to consolidate power and vertically integrate society.
[01:46:06.806 --> 01:46:09.589]  Yeah, we need to get our people back to work here.
[01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:11.191]  And I think people don't understand that.
[01:46:11.571 --> 01:46:13.674]  The politicians here, they're career politicians.
[01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:15.496]  They've never run a business in their lives.
[01:46:16.357 --> 01:46:16.757]  I have.
[01:46:16.877 --> 01:46:20.241]  You know, I worked in the city in the finance business for a long time and as an entrepreneur.
[01:46:20.582 --> 01:46:23.805]  And I know that you've got to get this economy back working.
[01:46:24.065 --> 01:46:26.128]  You've got to get our transport infrastructure back.
[01:46:26.428 --> 01:46:29.009]  And you've got to get the schools back.
[01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:30.610]  The kids have to go back to school.
[01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:33.371]  It's the family structure that allows the parents to work.
[01:46:33.491 --> 01:46:34.372]  Everyone's mental health.
[01:46:34.712 --> 01:46:37.293]  I sent my four-year-old son back to school on Monday.
[01:46:37.613 --> 01:46:40.095]  I sent my 16-year-old stepdaughter back to school.
[01:46:40.655 --> 01:46:42.776]  And you know, that's what we need to be doing here.
[01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:44.677]  The transport is a mess here in London.
[01:46:45.237 --> 01:46:47.238]  And these politicians, they just don't get it.
[01:46:47.858 --> 01:46:50.259]  They've completely shown a lack of leadership.
[01:46:50.499 --> 01:46:52.640]  And again, not a science-based approach.
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:54.080]  And that's what I advocate, Alex.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.260]  But the globalists get it.
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:57.601]  I mean, they say they want less carbon, less activity.
[01:46:57.621 --> 01:46:59.222]  This is going to wreck stuff for decades.
[01:46:59.562 --> 01:47:12.006]  The longer they do this, I mean, for folks that don't understand business, the investment in transport, the investment in business, the investment in buildings, the investment in all this, when it all falls apart and loses value, that will then put everybody into debt.
[01:47:12.446 --> 01:47:16.810]  It will kill savings, it will kill future lending, it will cause a depression!
[01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:19.792]  Yeah, it really is the silent killer.
[01:47:19.833 --> 01:47:28.860]  You don't see it necessarily in the hospital stats on a weekly basis, but this adds up and it will cost us dearly and it already is costing us dearly.
[01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:36.387]  We need to get this country, this world back to work and our politicians just aren't focusing on it because they're trying to cover up the tracks
[01:47:36.687 --> 01:47:37.588]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:47:37.708 --> 01:47:39.889]  In fact, this Town Hall article already mentioned it.
[01:47:39.909 --> 01:47:40.129]  The UN
[01:48:08.237 --> 01:48:15.745]  Says Stanford University isn't allowed to criticize them, and so they shut down the YouTube channel of the Hoover Institution, shut down their video.
[01:48:16.065 --> 01:48:27.616]  I mean, that is just bo- The Hoover Institute is one of the most establishment-respected things there is, and they said it's causing way more death than lockdown, the UN overblew this thing, and so Google goes, you're not allowed to criticize the UN.
[01:48:27.677 --> 01:48:28.878]  That is unbelievable.
[01:48:30.598 --> 01:48:32.420]  Well, don't get me started with Google and YouTube.
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:35.462]  I mean, we're about to hit our two millionth subscriber.
[01:48:35.502 --> 01:48:38.805]  That's nine years of hard work, 8,000 videos, a quarter billion views.
[01:48:39.165 --> 01:48:45.430]  And yet I've been told in no uncertain terms by my representatives, I am one upload away from BNT platform.
[01:48:45.710 --> 01:48:50.594]  They said, Brian, you might have had a strike and it might be disappeared, but you are one step away from being gone.
[01:48:51.175 --> 01:48:53.637]  And it's a community policy that's completely subjective.
[01:48:54.357 --> 01:48:58.681]  And so this is what it costs, Alex, to go out there and fight on the front lines.
[01:48:58.741 --> 01:49:00.322]  You know it, and people like I know it.
[01:49:00.703 --> 01:49:01.523]  It's not free.
[01:49:01.644 --> 01:49:02.584]  Freedom is not free.
[01:49:02.604 --> 01:49:07.749]  You know, I feel like I'm on a roulette wheel every day, putting my entire business on red or black to see what comes up.
[01:49:08.129 --> 01:49:09.210]  But it's worth it, Alex.
[01:49:09.630 --> 01:49:10.251]  No, I agree.
[01:49:10.351 --> 01:49:12.893]  To not live on your knees as a slave, but on your feet as a man.
[01:49:12.933 --> 01:49:15.675]  But Congress and the Parliament need to act.
[01:49:15.755 --> 01:49:21.060]  I mean, when big tech is more powerful than government and says they take orders from the UN, we're under UN control.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:31.663]  Yeah, well you saw, you know, that show, that circus show, when the four big leaders in tech went to Congress the other day, you know, kind of with their hat in their hands.
[01:49:31.723 --> 01:49:33.764]  But they're really running the show, let's be honest.
[01:49:33.964 --> 01:49:36.164]  And that's why nothing is changing right now.
[01:49:36.524 --> 01:49:44.207]  These companies are running the show, and the politicians can talk about it, but they have to ultimately kowtow to them, unless we can get the people to move on this.
[01:49:44.647 --> 01:49:47.448]  And so that's why we're trying to talk about this and put this information out there.
[01:49:47.928 --> 01:49:56.154]  But like you said, the economy going down, the lockdowns, the social distancing, the face masks, it separates us from exchanging ideas.
[01:49:56.754 --> 01:49:58.355]  And this is not helping us.
[01:49:58.415 --> 01:50:01.037]  So we need to fight back and really get out there on the front lines.
[01:50:01.718 --> 01:50:02.118]  You're right.
[01:50:02.158 --> 01:50:03.939]  Listen, we got two longer segments coming up.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.080]  I got a ton of questions.
[01:50:05.481 --> 01:50:06.921]  I want to get into some positive news as well.
[01:50:06.941 --> 01:50:09.203]  But what else is on your radar screen?
[01:50:09.603 --> 01:50:12.365]  I mean, we should talk about the things that you got censored for.
[01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:14.246]  5G questioning COVID.
[01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:16.268]  But haven't you and David Icke been vindicated?
[01:50:16.308 --> 01:50:19.750]  I mean, they admit COVID overblown hundreds of times what it really kills.
[01:50:21.391 --> 01:50:23.332]  90% fake positive test.
[01:50:23.673 --> 01:50:28.596]  I mean, I think the people that engineered all of this, this exaggeration, this scam should get in trouble.
[01:50:28.796 --> 01:50:29.677]  I don't think it's a hoax.
[01:50:29.957 --> 01:50:31.238]  If I thought it was, I would say that.
[01:50:31.838 --> 01:50:35.081]  I think it's a scam though, an exaggerated power grab.
[01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:40.547]  Yeah, to quote one of my guests, the virus is real, the pandemic is not.
[01:50:41.047 --> 01:50:42.128]  And that's what we need to remember.
[01:50:42.248 --> 01:50:50.136]  If you go back to my early episodes in March and April with David Icke, I'm telling you Alex, almost 90% of what he said came true to the letter.
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.221]  The fact that the testing was off.
[01:50:52.561 --> 01:50:54.763]  The fact that the testing did not correlate with deaths.
[01:50:55.103 --> 01:50:58.605]  The fact that this was happening in areas that were polluted or areas where there were labs.
[01:50:59.046 --> 01:51:00.206]  They were killing old people.
[01:51:00.346 --> 01:51:00.667]  Stay there.
[01:51:00.707 --> 01:51:06.631]  Let's talk about how you guys were right in all three of those interviews, especially that first one, that again, you can't get on YouTube.
[01:51:06.651 --> 01:51:08.192]  You have to get it at LondonReal.TV.
[01:51:08.552 --> 01:51:09.833]  We also, David has a channel with us.
[01:51:09.873 --> 01:51:10.433]  We mirror it.
[01:51:10.633 --> 01:51:12.234]  We're not in competition with each other, folks.
[01:51:12.254 --> 01:51:14.456]  We're in competition with the tyrants to defeat them.
[01:51:14.676 --> 01:51:17.018]  So it's all at LondonReal.TV and Band.Video.
[01:51:17.118 --> 01:51:18.799]  Share those interviews with David Icke.
[01:51:19.319 --> 01:51:20.679]  With Brian Rose right now.
[01:51:20.699 --> 01:51:21.659]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.440]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:26.240]  I want to be 100% clear here.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:30.801]  People say, man, Jones gets a lot of his guests on and tells them how great they are.
[01:51:30.881 --> 01:51:31.541]  Why does he do that?
[01:51:31.861 --> 01:51:36.062]  Well, I mean, I get people on that have a track record of having courage and telling the truth.
[01:51:36.502 --> 01:51:37.402]  And that's what I admire.
[01:51:37.962 --> 01:51:40.603]  Because I've had a chance to get to know a lot of the top Hollywood people.
[01:51:41.183 --> 01:51:44.963]  Found it was totally empty, sold out, very, very weak.
[01:51:45.584 --> 01:51:47.724]  And I've gotten a chance to know some of the top billionaires.
[01:51:48.772 --> 01:51:50.633]  You know, had the system try to get me on board with them.
[01:51:51.153 --> 01:51:52.653]  I haven't tried in probably 10 years.
[01:51:53.534 --> 01:51:54.714]  And it just had nothing to offer.
[01:51:55.354 --> 01:51:56.795]  And it's all the mavericks.
[01:51:56.975 --> 01:51:59.876]  It's the sui generis or one-of-a-kind type people.
[01:52:00.396 --> 01:52:03.798]  That is what the world of the universe is all about, and that's who changes things.
[01:52:03.858 --> 01:52:04.358]  And I know
[01:52:05.401 --> 01:52:10.182]  But the globalists running things want a post-human world and are very evil and very selfish.
[01:52:10.662 --> 01:52:15.023]  And you can debate who runs them or what they are, but it really is a fight between good and evil.
[01:52:15.903 --> 01:52:18.244]  And things are coming down to the line.
[01:52:18.444 --> 01:52:27.606]  And I see the servants of this system, the Nancy Pelosi's, the Michael Moore's, the Maxine Waters of the planet, and they don't look like they're having a very good time.
[01:52:28.286 --> 01:52:35.189]  And so I know I feel good and feel strong and feel empowered when I am telling the truth and standing up to them.
[01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:40.611]  And I know when I go out on the street, the people love us, just like Brian Rose said.
[01:52:40.691 --> 01:52:42.571]  So that's what scares the system.
[01:52:42.611 --> 01:52:47.673]  So Brian, I've got a lot of questions and a lot of comments and a lot to say, but you're a polite guy and I can talk a lot.
[01:52:47.693 --> 01:52:50.254]  So without me asking questions, what do you want to talk about?
[01:52:50.274 --> 01:52:57.837]  You've got the floor, the next 5-10 minutes to talk about the universe, the world, what you want to impart to this audience of conservatively probably a million people tuning in right now.
[01:52:59.904 --> 01:53:04.709]  Well, look, I want to start off and just say that everything you told me would happen has come true, Alex.
[01:53:05.009 --> 01:53:11.776]  You said that when we stuck our neck out here, they would start coming after my reputation, my business, my credibility, everything.
[01:53:12.016 --> 01:53:13.198]  And that all happened.
[01:53:13.218 --> 01:53:15.600]  You also told me, as you remember, Alex, to ask for help.
[01:53:16.021 --> 01:53:17.662]  Something I hadn't done my entire life.
[01:53:17.742 --> 01:53:19.524]  I had always thought I got to do it myself.
[01:53:19.965 --> 01:53:21.146]  Probably came from my upbringing.
[01:53:21.266 --> 01:53:22.828]  My parents got divorced at a young age.
[01:53:23.548 --> 01:53:44.381]  And that was not the way to go about this because you know there's that as that ancient African proverb you know you can go fast alone or you can go further together and that's what this is about Alex and you've been an inspiration to us here to show us that you can do it off-platform if you had told me a year ago that I might not have my YouTube channel I probably would have broken down in tears and said it's all over without YouTube but now I
[01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:46.603]  I've proven that we can do it without.
[01:53:46.743 --> 01:53:52.430]  So it's been incredible, but it's been a crazy road and it's been a difficult ride to be out there.
[01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:54.933]  But we got to put it on the line every single week.
[01:53:54.973 --> 01:54:01.600]  And so when I got the opportunity to world premiere this incredible documentary feature film, we knew we were going to get heat.
[01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:03.442]  We knew they were going to come after us.
[01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:04.604]  But at the same time, Alex,
[01:54:05.202 --> 01:54:06.864]  This was just too great an opportunity.
[01:54:07.185 --> 01:54:09.568]  And we just have big smiles on our faces around here.
[01:54:09.648 --> 01:54:16.237]  You know, we knew we were going to roll the dice and take a shot at the man, but we knew what we were doing was fighting for freedom.
[01:54:16.637 --> 01:54:21.324]  And so we went out there and gave it our all and, you know, we upset some people, that's for sure.
[01:54:21.804 --> 01:54:28.067]  But, you know, we blew some people's socks off by really streaming this to a massive audience.
[01:54:28.407 --> 01:54:32.749]  We reckon now it's been watched by over 45 million people because of what we did.
[01:54:33.089 --> 01:54:36.151]  And that's the version that we uploaded to our site that's been downloaded.
[01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:37.431]  It's free to download.
[01:54:37.451 --> 01:54:38.472]  All the clips are downloaded.
[01:54:38.932 --> 01:54:45.658]  So, the whole pandemic success was just another notch, really, against the tyranny.
[01:54:45.798 --> 01:54:48.100]  Us fighting against the tyranny and fighting for freedom.
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:51.863]  And it just showed the world that we can do this together, you know?
[01:54:51.963 --> 01:54:57.407]  Just 38,000 freedom fighters can put this out and stream against a man, and we kept it up.
[01:54:57.447 --> 01:55:00.830]  A lot of malicious attacks were coming in, but we kept it going.
[01:55:01.130 --> 01:55:05.994]  And it just shows how powerful we can be, even when all this oppression is happening out there, Alex.
[01:55:06.935 --> 01:55:11.380]  So I think that stream alone gave us a lot of confidence and a lot of fuel going forward.
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:13.522]  And, you know, we haven't looked back since.
[01:55:13.642 --> 01:55:14.523]  We're going to keep streaming.
[01:55:14.543 --> 01:55:15.484]  We're going to keep pushing it.
[01:55:15.804 --> 01:55:18.687]  And now I'm really going the attack against our leaders here in London.
[01:55:18.988 --> 01:55:20.990]  And I'm saying now is the time to be accountable.
[01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:22.191]  Where is the leadership?
[01:55:22.451 --> 01:55:23.853]  I'm tired of career politicians.
[01:55:23.953 --> 01:55:25.754]  I think it's time to ask real business questions.
[01:55:26.075 --> 01:55:27.196]  Let's get people back to work.
[01:55:27.396 --> 01:55:28.457]  Let's get the kids in the school.
[01:55:28.677 --> 01:55:29.959]  Let's figure out the transportation.
[01:55:30.919 --> 01:55:33.280]  Because that's the silent killer here, Alex.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:37.762]  That's what's really going to hurt us in the long run, is if these businesses are out.
[01:55:37.782 --> 01:55:40.664]  25,000 businesses have gone out of business here in London, never to come back.
[01:55:41.124 --> 01:55:42.905]  So that's our next wave of attack.
[01:55:43.525 --> 01:55:45.906]  But yeah, I'm trying to stay optimistic, you know, I really am.
[01:55:45.926 --> 01:55:47.667]  And the people on the street make me feel that way.
[01:55:48.834 --> 01:55:54.619]  Beautifully said, and I want to give people some advice here, not that I have all the answers, but I've learned this by experience.
[01:55:54.639 --> 01:55:56.341]  People say, how did you innovate this or innovate that?
[01:55:56.381 --> 01:55:59.163]  It was by necessity being the mother of invention.
[01:56:00.024 --> 01:56:05.049]  You've got to have the belief, the understanding, you've got to be in tune with the universe, you've got to be on the right path.
[01:56:05.849 --> 01:56:06.149]  I don't
[01:56:23.018 --> 01:56:24.159]  That's right.
[01:56:40.394 --> 01:56:48.683]  And if you have all of the other ingredients that were needed and you're steadfast, you will then change the entire paradigm and cause a tipping point.
[01:56:48.763 --> 01:56:49.664]  And the enemy knows.
[01:56:50.204 --> 01:56:51.706]  I believe we've already passed the tipping point.
[01:56:51.746 --> 01:56:53.548]  If not, we're right on the razor's edge of it.
[01:56:54.008 --> 01:56:57.772]  And they're throwing everything they've got at us right now to stop that tipping point of a new renaissance.
[01:56:57.812 --> 01:56:58.233]  What do you think?
[01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:03.082]  No, I think you're right, Alex, and I always go back to this expression that one of my mentors said.
[01:57:03.122 --> 01:57:08.684]  He said, Brian, FEAR, F-E-A-R, stands for False Expectations Appearing Real.
[01:57:09.084 --> 01:57:18.408]  And most of us live our lives, Alex, we live these quiet lives of desperation because of these phantoms around us that we're just scared to walk into, to test them.
[01:57:18.688 --> 01:57:21.190]  And when we walk into them, we realize that there's nothing there.
[01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:24.271]  There's a couple people behind the curtain pulling the strings, Alex.
[01:57:24.531 --> 01:57:26.472]  But once you push through and you stand up to them,
[01:57:27.072 --> 01:57:29.134]  And other people see you do that and they join you.
[01:57:29.554 --> 01:57:31.815]  It doesn't take many people really to push through.
[01:57:31.835 --> 01:57:32.676]  That's the key.
[01:57:33.116 --> 01:57:34.597]  You're talking about leadership right there.
[01:57:34.617 --> 01:57:35.397]  Keep elaborating on it.
[01:57:35.417 --> 01:57:35.778]  Exactly.
[01:57:36.078 --> 01:57:40.601]  It's up to us to take the hits up front for everybody's well-being in the end.
[01:57:40.781 --> 01:57:44.243]  And again, it's a paradigm because it's a paradox.
[01:57:45.024 --> 01:57:47.745]  It's good to do it for your own individuality to have a free society.
[01:57:48.366 --> 01:57:50.587]  And it's also good for everybody else at the same time.
[01:57:50.667 --> 01:57:55.050]  So it's not self-serving, but it is to do the right thing and be a leader.
[01:57:56.522 --> 01:58:00.904]  Yeah, it just takes one person to charge the line and blast through and then everyone else will come and follow.
[01:58:01.284 --> 01:58:02.745]  And so you just need that leadership.
[01:58:02.765 --> 01:58:05.906]  But I would say to everybody out there, there's something out there you're scared of.
[01:58:05.966 --> 01:58:10.288]  It could be losing your job, losing your business, the government, you know, everything around COVID.
[01:58:10.729 --> 01:58:17.712]  I would just, you know, challenge you to challenge some of those fears because you can blast right through those and you'll find a new reality on the other side.
[01:58:17.772 --> 01:58:22.474]  And Alex, it's just a small percentage of the people out there that are setting this globalist agenda.
[01:58:22.814 --> 01:58:23.294]  You know that.
[01:58:23.515 --> 01:58:23.915]  I know that.
[01:58:24.215 --> 01:58:29.119]  And if we get enough of us to push through and break through, we can set up a new form of reality.
[01:58:29.439 --> 01:58:32.301]  And we find a whole group of people that are going to go with us to the other side.
[01:58:32.602 --> 01:58:34.103]  And it's a beautiful new reality.
[01:58:34.123 --> 01:58:35.484]  And that's why I'm so optimistic.
[01:58:35.784 --> 01:58:38.907]  That's why I know we have an army behind us to take us to the next level.
[01:58:39.267 --> 01:58:42.549]  And that's why every single day we're fighting here and we're pushing through.
[01:58:42.569 --> 01:58:43.850]  I know we can do this.
[01:58:44.171 --> 01:58:49.515]  And again, open up that curtain like you've seen and really see and show what's on the other side.
[01:58:49.875 --> 01:58:50.936]  I know we're going to get through this.
[01:58:51.136 --> 01:58:54.418]  I know we're going to be stronger, but I do know we still got some fight left, Alex.
[01:58:54.438 --> 01:58:57.881]  There's going to be a bumpy road and we're going to be pushed and challenged again.
[01:58:57.921 --> 01:59:03.065]  They're going to keep attacking our relationship, our reputations, our business, and even our digital platforms.
[01:59:03.565 --> 01:59:06.307]  But like I said, you know, you've been really an example.
[01:59:06.767 --> 01:59:08.289]  To show me what we can do.
[01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:11.352]  And I love my new reality better than a year ago.
[01:59:11.593 --> 01:59:13.835]  I'd rather be this guy today than I was a year ago.
[01:59:13.855 --> 01:59:15.036]  I feel confident.
[01:59:15.397 --> 01:59:16.077]  I feel happy.
[01:59:16.258 --> 01:59:17.859]  I come to work with a smile on my face.
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:21.583]  And like you said, that's the true measure, I think, if you know you're doing the right thing.
[01:59:21.604 --> 01:59:22.064]  Well, you're a warrior.
[01:59:22.084 --> 01:59:22.905]  You know you're doing the right thing.
[01:59:22.925 --> 01:59:23.626]  And I want to just say this.
[01:59:23.646 --> 01:59:24.607]  I'm not going to name any names, but...
[01:59:25.816 --> 01:59:39.761]  You were doing self-help and exercise things and business startups and really glistening beautiful videos, amazing interviews, very diverse, a lot of it game-changing, a lot of it, you know, just just I'm gonna say mainstream, but just you weren't a threat to the system, you were trying to empower people in general.
[01:59:40.182 --> 01:59:42.983]  But when you saw the censorship and you saw the oppression,
[01:59:43.723 --> 01:59:46.705]  And you ran towards that, saying that was wrong.
[01:59:47.466 --> 01:59:50.788]  Other people I knew that when it was easy, they were the patriots, they were the pro-humans.
[01:59:51.048 --> 01:59:58.173]  As soon as the heat came, they hid under the table, waiting for themselves to finally be censored, and then nobody was left to come and save them.
[01:59:58.213 --> 02:00:02.416]  The old World War II proverb of the Nazis, you know, by the time they came for me, there was nobody left.
[02:00:02.756 --> 02:00:08.280]  And so that's why what you did was important is, when you saw the tyranny, that's when you really got in the trenches.
[02:00:09.121 --> 02:00:11.742]  When other people I know, and I won't name them, they ran away
[02:00:13.064 --> 02:00:19.732]  Well, again, I think, you know, I got into this at the perfect time in my life.
[02:00:19.812 --> 02:00:21.814]  I never started this to run a business.
[02:00:21.854 --> 02:00:23.316]  I had already gotten that out of my system.
[02:00:23.716 --> 02:00:25.078]  And you asked me this before, Alex.
[02:00:25.198 --> 02:00:27.140]  It was just an amygdala response.
[02:00:27.581 --> 02:00:28.422]  I said, no way.
[02:00:28.742 --> 02:00:30.464]  There's nobody that's taken that away from me.
[02:00:30.504 --> 02:00:31.606]  I don't like to be told what to do.
[02:00:31.886 --> 02:00:32.487]  We're good to go.
[02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:52.114]  But they gotta be stood up to, and that's what we're doing here, and we've had a ton of support doing it.
[02:00:52.455 --> 02:00:53.355]  Brian Rose, stay there.
[02:00:53.375 --> 02:00:54.256]  There's a lot of people out there.
[02:00:54.476 --> 02:00:55.157]  Final segment.
[02:00:55.197 --> 02:00:57.859]  I want to talk about this because I know what I'm calling this interview right now.
[02:00:57.959 --> 02:01:00.562]  Brian Rose and the sleeping giant effect.
[02:01:00.842 --> 02:01:03.704]  Because most people don't get engaged until they see the tyranny.
[02:01:03.924 --> 02:01:04.645]  They just activate it.
[02:01:04.665 --> 02:01:05.546]  People like Brian Rose.
[02:01:06.527 --> 02:01:07.608]  There's blood on the streets.
[02:01:07.668 --> 02:01:08.849]  It's up to Michaels.
[02:01:10.589 --> 02:01:19.359]  You know, I played this clip like six months ago and Media Matters had an article that Jones was threatening to kill people because he was singing a song.
[02:01:21.502 --> 02:01:23.865]  That was what they're pulling.
[02:01:24.506 --> 02:01:27.069]  They're pushing violence because they're losing political.
[02:01:28.328 --> 02:01:28.628]  Fight.
[02:01:28.748 --> 02:01:29.989]  So they want to make it physical.
[02:01:30.670 --> 02:01:38.076]  Our guests can be with us 15 minutes the next hour as I do customarily sometimes and then the great Gerald Salentis will take over for three segments ahead of the war with Owen Schroer.
[02:01:38.516 --> 02:01:40.098]  And of course, election countdown now.
[02:01:40.458 --> 02:01:41.939]  Seven to nine weeknights.
[02:01:41.999 --> 02:01:44.001]  Owen Schroer tonight, Deanna Lorraine tomorrow night.
[02:01:44.321 --> 02:01:49.265]  And I'll, of course, be part of all of those transmissions with special reports that I shoot right before they go live.
[02:01:49.505 --> 02:01:53.168]  But let me just bring up something that Brian Rose of London Real dot TV just talked about.
[02:01:54.469 --> 02:01:57.712]  I knew who he was and we had great sets of successful business.
[02:01:59.324 --> 02:02:06.638]  Reaching millions of people a week and he was already doing some thought-provoking stuff, but then when I saw him get hardcore and I interviewed him
[02:02:07.762 --> 02:02:08.222]  I don't think so.
[02:02:30.754 --> 02:02:34.077]  Independent, original mavericks that builds Valhalla.
[02:02:34.958 --> 02:02:37.900]  And that's what the West was supposed to be about and that's what the Globals want to get rid of it.
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:40.603]  But he was talking about how he didn't want to ask for help.
[02:02:40.643 --> 02:02:42.725]  He wanted to finance it with his own business earnings.
[02:02:43.685 --> 02:02:51.492]  And then I saw the talking point start when they censored him off YouTube, they were blocking his videos, they blocked him on Facebook, when they banned him on all his other things.
[02:02:52.592 --> 02:02:54.914]  Then I got the emails and the calls.
[02:02:54.934 --> 02:02:57.016]  Oh, that guy's just making money off people.
[02:02:57.457 --> 02:02:59.038]  He's he's blah blah blah.
[02:02:59.118 --> 02:02:59.499]  Oh, really?
[02:02:59.539 --> 02:03:06.586]  He raised a million and a half dollars or something to fund studios and uplinks and huge events and staff and crew?
[02:03:06.886 --> 02:03:08.788]  That's nothing, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:09.629]  It cost us...
[02:03:11.597 --> 02:03:19.765]  $20 million a year to run this with radio, satellites, TV, legal, licensing, funding, taxes, regulations, all of it.
[02:03:20.706 --> 02:03:24.930]  Oh, it's okay if George Soros has tens of millions of dollars to fund Black Lives Matter and Antifa.
[02:03:25.110 --> 02:03:25.731]  That's okay.
[02:03:26.011 --> 02:03:28.193]  It's okay if they have $5 billion to overthrow Ukraine.
[02:03:28.213 --> 02:03:30.976]  And, you know, it's okay if CNN has $700 million a year.
[02:03:31.216 --> 02:03:31.657]  It's okay.
[02:03:32.776 --> 02:03:40.161]  But if Brian Rose raises $1.6 million to start his own platform and then to stream all that... You know what our bandwidth costs us right now, last time I checked?
[02:03:40.701 --> 02:03:41.802]  IT, bandwidth, all of it.
[02:03:43.038 --> 02:03:45.480]  Like $7 million a year or something.
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:47.481]  And we've gotten some of the cheapest bandwidth out there.
[02:03:47.741 --> 02:03:52.364]  You try having a million people click on your streams every day or your videos.
[02:03:52.644 --> 02:03:54.325]  You try making the payroll.
[02:03:54.546 --> 02:03:55.746]  See, that's why they hate us.
[02:03:55.846 --> 02:03:57.107]  No one's built something like this.
[02:03:57.608 --> 02:04:00.209]  So I'm always hoping the NRA started something like this.
[02:04:00.469 --> 02:04:03.712]  They infiltrated them with CIA operatives, blew up the NRA.
[02:04:03.732 --> 02:04:04.772]  I know all the inside baseball.
[02:04:04.972 --> 02:04:05.653]  Not a liberty to tell you.
[02:04:06.113 --> 02:04:12.995]  Destroyed it all, now they're trying to shut them down, and Leticia James is suing them, the New York AG under Soros.
[02:04:13.715 --> 02:04:16.716]  I was so, I know, I know the people involved in RATV.
[02:04:17.437 --> 02:04:21.138]  I know they're top people, I know they were getting up to 15 million views a day.
[02:04:21.598 --> 02:04:23.839]  I was going to sleep feeling so good, it was hardcore.
[02:04:24.299 --> 02:04:25.519]  Dan Bongino, all those people.
[02:04:25.739 --> 02:04:26.759]  It's all gone now, folks.
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:27.900]  They blow it all up.
[02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:35.228]  So, imagine being one of the only people, and it's scary, I want to see London Real get bigger than them fours.
[02:04:35.489 --> 02:04:37.651]  I want to see David Icke get bigger, and in some cases he has.
[02:04:38.032 --> 02:04:41.877]  I want to see Paul Joseph Watson get up off, he works hard but he won't do stuff public.
[02:04:42.618 --> 02:04:46.202]  I want you to be somebody, I want all of us in this fight, because...
[02:04:47.043 --> 02:04:48.325]  They're trying to extinct us.
[02:04:48.586 --> 02:04:50.429]  They're trying to genocide our speech.
[02:04:50.669 --> 02:04:52.733]  They're trying to genocide independent media.
[02:04:53.073 --> 02:04:54.696]  And I don't want to be last of the Mohegans.
[02:04:54.776 --> 02:04:56.158]  I don't want to be the last guy standing.
[02:04:56.399 --> 02:04:57.520]  Because they're going to get me too.
[02:04:58.282 --> 02:05:00.846]  The victory will be so many people like Brian Rose.
[02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:04.213]  Who see the tyranny and then they join.
[02:05:04.974 --> 02:05:06.916]  They didn't get in the movement to be part of it.
[02:05:06.956 --> 02:05:07.857]  They saw the tyranny.
[02:05:08.037 --> 02:05:16.367]  They came and put themselves at risk when they were already successful, could have played ball, could have gone along with the system like certain people we know, who are friends of mine, who I don't dislike them.
[02:05:16.587 --> 02:05:18.809]  I just don't respect them as much as I respect Brian.
[02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:20.291]  So I'll say this, then I'll get back to him.
[02:05:20.311 --> 02:05:20.732]  He's our guest.
[02:05:22.478 --> 02:05:23.939]  I've got all the supplements you need.
[02:05:24.019 --> 02:05:24.979]  I've got all the products.
[02:05:25.239 --> 02:05:31.222]  You know they called for a criminal investigation and they did one because I said vitamin D3 and zinc and C were essential.
[02:05:31.262 --> 02:05:32.963]  You needed to see yourselves won't make COVID.
[02:05:33.483 --> 02:05:37.485]  Of course, ladies and gentlemen, that's a fact.
[02:05:37.745 --> 02:05:40.987]  We were already selling those products had nothing to do with COVID.
[02:05:41.267 --> 02:05:42.488]  Now Fauci comes out.
[02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:49.073]  And says you need vitamin D3 and C and zinc to live to block COVID, because it's a scientific fact.
[02:05:49.493 --> 02:05:51.394]  But they wanted to not even let you know that.
[02:05:51.574 --> 02:05:53.915]  Why would Fauci now have to come out and admit that?
[02:05:54.656 --> 02:05:59.819]  So, COVID is a real virus, but an overblown hoax in the pandemic, as our guest said.
[02:06:00.079 --> 02:06:02.020]  I don't sell these products for COVID-19.
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:09.784]  I was selling them before then, because if you don't have D3, and if you don't have these type of things that are concentrated we have that you can get from food, it takes a lot...
[02:06:10.544 --> 02:06:11.604]  More of it, you can die!
[02:06:12.225 --> 02:06:18.946]  But of course I promote, David Hogg famously said, Jones says there's poison in the water, then he sells a water filter.
[02:06:19.547 --> 02:06:21.767]  From his scam view, he thinks there's a scam.
[02:06:22.067 --> 02:06:26.648]  He doesn't know about straight sales, like, this is a great water filter, I use it for my family, you need this.
[02:06:27.469 --> 02:06:29.809]  Like selling scuba tanks to somebody going scuba diving.
[02:06:30.370 --> 02:06:33.790]  He thinks it's a scam instead of straight shooting, but that's what this comes down to.
[02:06:33.810 --> 02:06:35.151]  That's why your financial support
[02:06:36.061 --> 02:06:46.224]  Of what I do and of what Brian Rose does and so many others is so critical because when somebody is in the arena fighting the globalists, they're not going to be able to continue on if it isn't for you.
[02:06:46.284 --> 02:06:52.887]  So it isn't just like you're a sidekick, like I'm Batman and you're Robin, or Brian Rose is Batman and you support him, you're Robin.
[02:06:53.207 --> 02:06:54.947]  No baby, we're all Batman together.
[02:06:55.708 --> 02:06:56.328]  You understand that?
[02:06:56.368 --> 02:06:57.228]  We're all one.
[02:06:57.328 --> 02:06:58.288]  We're the front line.
[02:06:58.368 --> 02:06:59.269]  We're Hercules.
[02:06:59.969 --> 02:07:01.009]  We're Ulysses.
[02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:03.611]  We're the main guy fighting the Hydra.
[02:07:04.071 --> 02:07:04.351]  Okay?
[02:07:04.391 --> 02:07:04.871]  You're it.
[02:07:05.231 --> 02:07:07.352]  Your support, your word of mouth is king.
[02:07:07.572 --> 02:07:11.094]  It isn't like some vestigial thing like pat you on the head and thank you for it.
[02:07:11.334 --> 02:07:11.834]  It's everything.
[02:07:12.034 --> 02:07:12.875]  I just took half that segment.
[02:07:12.895 --> 02:07:26.981]  We'll have plenty of time the next 15 minutes after that, Brian, but I just wanted to talk about the fact of how precious it is to keep you and everybody else on the air, and not just on the air, but thriving and dominating up against these big, evil, authoritarian, big tech scumbags.
[02:07:29.164 --> 02:07:30.725]  Yeah, and Alex, I appreciate you saying that.
[02:07:31.065 --> 02:07:32.186]  It's music to my ears.
[02:07:32.246 --> 02:07:36.749]  But you would only know that if you were at the very front, on the tip of the spear, fighting these guys.
[02:07:36.789 --> 02:07:47.637]  It takes a lot of money, it takes a lot of planning, not to mention all of the malicious attacks happening in the background and the redundancies we built into our systems over and over and over again to make sure we weren't going to be attacked.
[02:07:47.657 --> 02:07:48.978]  We built our own digital player.
[02:07:49.418 --> 02:07:50.319]  I could go on and on.
[02:07:50.359 --> 02:07:51.820]  But the truth is, is that over 70%
[02:07:53.241 --> 02:07:57.502]  Of our views from the recent pandemic stream came from peer-to-peer sharing, Alex.
[02:07:57.802 --> 02:07:59.503]  And that's exactly what you just spoke of.
[02:07:59.843 --> 02:08:03.284]  That's people on the front lines sharing our content.
[02:08:03.324 --> 02:08:04.604]  Not waiting for a search engine.
[02:08:04.964 --> 02:08:06.845]  Not waiting for some social media platform.
[02:08:06.905 --> 02:08:08.986]  And that's why I know... I'm going to interrupt you again because you said something key.
[02:08:09.346 --> 02:08:10.726]  We've had to build everything.
[02:08:10.786 --> 02:08:12.627]  We can't have anything that's already built.
[02:08:12.927 --> 02:08:16.608]  We have to pay for every piece of it because all the stuff's owned by the globalists.
[02:08:16.628 --> 02:08:17.108]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:08:17.648 --> 02:08:17.788]  Yeah.
[02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:25.135]  Even our fundraising campaign, we had to do ourselves because I knew it was going to get yanked by somebody, by any one of these crowdfunding campaigns.
[02:08:25.155 --> 02:08:26.336]  We had to build that from scratch.
[02:08:26.697 --> 02:08:28.799]  So people don't realize a lot of those details.
[02:08:29.299 --> 02:08:34.464]  And you know, the truth is, is that you don't, you don't just get opposition from, you know, the opposing party.
[02:08:34.504 --> 02:08:36.706]  You get it from people that should be supporting you.
[02:08:36.806 --> 02:08:37.446]  You know that, Alex.
[02:08:37.486 --> 02:08:44.230]  And that's why you reached out super early, Alex, and it was really inspirational to have you on our side as we push forward.
[02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:46.772]  Again, I don't think this stuff would have happened if it wasn't for you.
[02:08:46.852 --> 02:08:47.692]  So thank you for that, Alex.
[02:08:47.712 --> 02:08:48.252]  I really appreciate that.
[02:08:48.272 --> 02:08:49.333]  Well, it's our audience that did it, but don't run.
[02:08:49.353 --> 02:08:50.314]  I get what you were doing, man.
[02:08:50.734 --> 02:08:51.855]  And I want you to succeed, brother.
[02:08:51.875 --> 02:08:54.256]  You're on the front lines against the main hydra, brother.
[02:08:54.576 --> 02:08:55.717]  We need you bad.
[02:08:55.757 --> 02:08:58.398]  I mean, literally, people need to get how precious this is.
[02:08:58.418 --> 02:08:59.539]  I mean, what is there?
[02:08:59.559 --> 02:09:04.021]  Maybe a couple dozen people prominently fighting, and the enemy's attacking us all.
[02:09:04.041 --> 02:09:04.862]  We've got to stay in the game.
[02:09:05.865 --> 02:09:06.806]  Yeah, and you said it, Alex.
[02:09:06.846 --> 02:09:13.249]  I mean, I was really disappointed by, you know, some of our leadership out there, even in some of the new media and independent media space.
[02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:22.775]  I really expected them to take advantage of this time during lockdown and all the misinformation and the disproportionate response and call people out and have the doctors on.
[02:09:22.795 --> 02:09:24.837]  But a lot of people, it was just business as usual.
[02:09:25.277 --> 02:09:26.317]  Some people took a break.
[02:09:26.658 --> 02:09:29.239]  Some people were just talking about, you know, goofy stuff.
[02:09:29.599 --> 02:09:35.343]  But I felt like we needed to come in every day and have the hard conversations and potentially get banned from social media.
[02:09:35.603 --> 02:09:41.268]  And have people even question my integrity when it came to spending their hard-earned money, most of which I haven't spent.
[02:09:41.548 --> 02:09:44.510]  It's in the bank for that next big livestream we have to do.
[02:09:44.591 --> 02:09:46.993]  But that's what you gotta do sometimes, is take those hits.
[02:09:47.513 --> 02:09:50.135]  And I appreciate your cooperative spirit, Alex.
[02:09:50.195 --> 02:09:54.879]  It's our mission statement here to create a fully empowered, conscious, and cooperative species.
[02:09:55.319 --> 02:09:57.361]  And I agree, we gotta get there together, brother.
[02:09:57.762 --> 02:10:01.865]  And you could have easily just said, no, I'm gonna just stick with InfoWars and not support those guys.
[02:10:01.885 --> 02:10:02.966]  But you did the opposite.
[02:10:03.466 --> 02:10:05.168]  And I appreciate you for that.
[02:10:05.248 --> 02:10:06.408]  And I, again, I agree.
[02:10:06.428 --> 02:10:08.250]  I want David to be successful.
[02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:09.891]  David Icke, I want you to be successful.
[02:10:09.931 --> 02:10:12.533]  The more of us, the better when it comes to this fight.
[02:10:13.774 --> 02:10:19.739]  You know, so many people do say they're ideologues for freedom, but they really don't stick their head up above anything.
[02:10:19.839 --> 02:10:20.479]  It's pathetic.
[02:10:20.759 --> 02:10:23.962]  And they're going to end up getting it because of that attitude if we lose.
[02:10:24.342 --> 02:10:25.243]  At least lose this round.
[02:10:26.755 --> 02:10:27.675]  I know, that's the problem.
[02:10:27.735 --> 02:10:33.837]  It feels like the safe move, but you know that old expression, you know, playing it safe could be the most dangerous thing that you do.
[02:10:34.298 --> 02:10:40.360]  And so that will come back and bite him in other ways, but we just got to move forward, lead by example, hope they come for us.
[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:44.121]  We are still working here for the legislation of digital freedom of speech.
[02:10:44.441 --> 02:10:45.601]  We just heard our 230,000th signature.
[02:10:47.942 --> 02:10:53.107]  Asking, demanding our people in government to go ahead and fight back against these companies.
[02:10:53.407 --> 02:10:54.008]  You can do it.
[02:10:54.128 --> 02:10:55.349]  We have rule of law here.
[02:10:55.630 --> 02:11:01.335]  If you sanction YouTube here in the UK and say you have to allow freedom of speech, we know we can fight back against these companies.
[02:11:01.595 --> 02:11:07.320]  So we're going full throttle against them on every single channel positive and still streaming on the digital freedom platform.
[02:11:07.361 --> 02:11:10.824]  So that's our plan here, Alex, and to provide solutions for the City of London.
[02:11:11.405 --> 02:11:13.047]  It is an outrageous power grab.
[02:11:13.087 --> 02:11:26.599]  Let's talk about solutions when we come back, because to start censoring major think tanks via the UN because they said COVID was overblown and that it's killing more people, the lockdown is, than the COVID, that's a fact.
[02:11:27.079 --> 02:11:28.781]  But I mean, that is a big deal.
[02:11:28.821 --> 02:11:30.362]  They've really jumped the shark, I think.
[02:11:30.863 --> 02:11:32.484]  And so we'll talk about that when we come back.
[02:11:32.524 --> 02:11:37.729]  I mean, I've got thousands of topics, folks, but I keep bringing up the same thing because the UN is now censoring Stanford.
[02:11:39.636 --> 02:11:42.719]  All right, two more segments left with Brian Rose here.
[02:11:43.179 --> 02:11:44.960]  So five-minute segment, ten-minute segment coming up.
[02:11:45.741 --> 02:11:52.487]  So Brian, I've been asking a lot of questions here, and I've gone off on a jag about supporting independent media, and I want to ask you what else you want to get into here.
[02:11:54.241 --> 02:11:58.687]  Imagine the power of the globalists and what they're doing, this authoritarianism, if they're not challenged.
[02:11:59.207 --> 02:12:09.481]  I'm actually pleasantly surprised at the massive backlashes that are happening, including federal courts ruling that Pennsylvania can't keep their economy locked down and that it's actually a crime against humanity, which it is.
[02:12:11.963 --> 02:12:20.873]  Yeah, I mean, look, the truth is they just overdid this campaign of fear, and we just had a completely inconsistent message from our government, and it is no science-based decisions.
[02:12:21.434 --> 02:12:27.240]  And so, finally, we're seeing some of the courts, you know, fight back against this and say, no, you can't do this, you can't limit those.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:29.322]  And some of these are just constitutional rights.
[02:12:30.223 --> 02:12:40.348]  That's one of my campaigns here for the next few weeks, is to really try to call out the government, speak to the businesses, get us back to work, and again, some science-based decisions, Alex.
[02:12:40.488 --> 02:12:45.471]  I mean, you know, a few weeks ago we were all told to go out to dinner and support restaurants here in the UK.
[02:12:45.831 --> 02:12:51.214]  Now, a few days ago, we were just told we cannot go out in groups more than six, in any capacity.
[02:12:51.634 --> 02:12:53.015]  It's a mixed message from the government.
[02:12:53.235 --> 02:12:54.816]  They're constantly reversing on themselves.
[02:12:55.176 --> 02:12:57.257]  And again, we just need some leadership from the front.
[02:12:57.757 --> 02:12:59.558]  We need some science-based decisions making.
[02:12:59.598 --> 02:13:00.798]  And we need a clear message.
[02:13:00.958 --> 02:13:01.919]  And we just don't have that.
[02:13:02.299 --> 02:13:03.179]  At least here in the UK.
[02:13:03.219 --> 02:13:04.760]  And from what I see, it's the same in America.
[02:13:05.216 --> 02:13:16.039]  Well, obviously, the politicians are minions, and Boris Johnson, who I was really behind, has really embarrassed himself, even the guy that put him into power, Nigel Farage, has said he better watch out and turn around.
[02:13:16.439 --> 02:13:18.700]  I want to believe in Boris Johnson, but he's not being a leader.
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:22.181]  He's buying into this whole thing and going along with it.
[02:13:23.769 --> 02:13:24.930]  But just seems a reaction.
[02:13:25.190 --> 02:13:29.632]  And they're also not even trusting or rebuking their own science advisors.
[02:13:30.032 --> 02:13:31.833]  And look, you know, I went to MIT.
[02:13:31.873 --> 02:13:33.374]  I got a degree in mechanical engineering.
[02:13:33.394 --> 02:13:35.635]  I'm all about the data driven approach.
[02:13:36.055 --> 02:13:40.998]  You know, not some anecdote or not some policy that covers a bad decision I made five months ago.
[02:13:41.378 --> 02:13:44.119]  The mayor of London here, I mean, it's just a complete mess.
[02:13:44.179 --> 02:13:45.280]  He's a career politician.
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:48.742]  He is constantly whining and complaining and asking for more handouts.
[02:13:49.082 --> 02:13:58.108]  What I want to get people back on their feet, and again, really focus on the economy, getting kids back to school, and moving forward with, again, these science-based decisions.
[02:13:58.148 --> 02:14:01.149]  Sure, they can say science-based themselves, but they're not science-based.
[02:14:01.570 --> 02:14:03.531]  In fact, you got interrupted by The Breaker.
[02:14:04.011 --> 02:14:06.172]  Get into everything they told us was not accurate.
[02:14:06.212 --> 02:14:08.034]  That's what Stanford's saying.
[02:14:08.054 --> 02:14:09.574]  They're like, nothing we were told is real.
[02:14:09.775 --> 02:14:10.755]  They go, oh, you're censored.
[02:14:10.775 --> 02:14:11.376]  You can't say that.
[02:14:11.396 --> 02:14:11.856]  But it's true.
[02:14:13.459 --> 02:14:31.170]  Well, you know, part of the fascination of the movie pandemic is because it goes deep into who the fact checkers are and how the fact that a lot of these algorithms and quote-unquote search engines, which is not true to what Google is, they take one piece of misinformation, they repeat it about a hundred times, and any common user just sees it and believes it to be true.
[02:14:31.610 --> 02:14:36.153]  But a lot of these fact-checking organizations are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[02:14:36.733 --> 02:14:44.075]  I had a video of Ronnie Coldman, eight-time Mr. Olympia, get flagged for fact-check on COVID by Facebook the other day.
[02:14:44.515 --> 02:14:46.095]  So, it's blatant what they're doing.
[02:14:46.395 --> 02:14:50.657]  The community policy of YouTube is just a catch-all for not saying what they want you to say.
[02:14:51.337 --> 02:14:53.337]  And we're seeing this over and over again.
[02:14:53.377 --> 02:14:57.198]  But back to what Ike was saying in March and April, most of that stuff came true.
[02:14:57.218 --> 02:15:01.139]  I even saw that being reported in the New York Times, something that he said in April.
[02:15:01.479 --> 02:15:04.220]  But now, the mainstream media covers it, it's okay.
[02:15:05.141 --> 02:15:07.082]  It's just hard to watch the duplicity.
[02:15:07.443 --> 02:15:08.744]  But look, I'm in for this fight.
[02:15:09.124 --> 02:15:10.285]  I was made for this, Alex.
[02:15:10.706 --> 02:15:13.028]  And we're going to go forward, but with solutions now.
[02:15:13.088 --> 02:15:14.029]  That's what I want to provide.
[02:15:14.109 --> 02:15:15.530]  Solutions and leadership.
[02:15:15.850 --> 02:15:18.793]  If the government's not going to do it, we're going to do it here at London Real.
[02:15:19.497 --> 02:15:23.979]  Well let's go to break into one more segment and talk about how you see those solutions unfolding and what the system is going to do.
[02:15:24.399 --> 02:15:32.323]  Because I agree with you, they have totally overplayed their hand and having the UN say it's in charge of all the everything, that is not going to go well.
[02:15:32.343 --> 02:15:34.224]  Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Rose is at London Real.
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:35.720]  We're good.
[02:16:00.162 --> 02:16:01.983]  The good news is it's up on Infowars.com.
[02:16:02.343 --> 02:16:06.846]  Federal judge rules Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's COVID lockdowns unconstitutional.
[02:16:07.346 --> 02:16:08.667]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:08.727 --> 02:16:09.227]  Stay with us.
[02:16:09.287 --> 02:16:10.308]  Back in 60 seconds.
[02:16:10.328 --> 02:16:10.928]  Final segment.
[02:16:11.209 --> 02:16:12.569]  Then Gerald Cilente takes over.
[02:16:14.230 --> 02:16:23.416]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, Brian Rose of LondonReal.tv, a trailblazing independent journalist with his own media operation.
[02:16:27.919 --> 02:16:28.279]  Live.
[02:16:32.645 --> 02:16:34.266]  All right, Brian, we got 10 minutes left.
[02:16:34.326 --> 02:16:35.586]  Really love the interview today.
[02:16:35.666 --> 02:16:36.407]  Love what you're doing.
[02:16:36.907 --> 02:16:38.528]  I revel in your success.
[02:16:39.428 --> 02:16:51.053]  I love it when I'm like on the hike and bike trail and somebody's on a park bench and I'm like, I know that voice and it's it's Brian Rose over there and it's somebody I've never heard of you're interviewing.
[02:16:51.914 --> 02:16:54.335]  That's excitement and you don't see that.
[02:16:54.915 --> 02:16:56.236]  I never see anybody watching
[02:16:58.283 --> 02:17:00.424]  Mainline CNN host or ABC host.
[02:17:00.464 --> 02:17:09.146]  I mean, you want to give us some solutions in a few final minutes, but the kicking and screaming and death throes of the establishment in Hollywood are clear.
[02:17:09.246 --> 02:17:12.987]  All the metrics are there, but they know that we don't like them.
[02:17:13.187 --> 02:17:14.628]  They know we've rejected them.
[02:17:15.068 --> 02:17:16.488]  They know they're having to force feed us.
[02:17:16.568 --> 02:17:23.130]  What are they going to pull in their attempt to try to stay relevant and make us submit to them?
[02:17:24.773 --> 02:17:25.714]  You know, it's a great question.
[02:17:25.734 --> 02:17:29.757]  It's funny how you were saying how you walk by people that they're listening to independent media sources.
[02:17:29.777 --> 02:17:35.222]  You know, I was in the park here, Hampstead Heath, yesterday and one person noticed me and then another person.
[02:17:35.242 --> 02:17:46.752]  And pretty soon, Alex, I had a group of six or seven people and we had a conversation for an hour all about what the solution was, where the information was, who's optimistic, who's not optimistic, whether you can trust the politicians or not.
[02:17:47.032 --> 02:17:48.233]  What do we do on the second wave?
[02:17:48.553 --> 02:17:55.021]  And it was in this incredible moment and you could tell these people were feasting for that real human connection and real talk, Alex.
[02:17:55.101 --> 02:18:01.549]  Not something that's being fed to them by Hollywood or being censored or put some echoed feed on a social media channel.
[02:18:01.569 --> 02:18:06.515]  There was that human secret, that real six-cent dynamo, that magic.
[02:18:07.591 --> 02:18:10.872]  Yeah, and I told them we're not wearing masks so we can see each other's face.
[02:18:11.272 --> 02:18:26.077]  I shook all their hands, I'll just say it, and we had a real conversation and they were hopeful and optimistic and they were all, you know, quote-unquote London Reelers and they had watched you and they watched Ike and they were all talking about the solutions and what we can do and does it come from within or without or our governments and
[02:18:26.597 --> 02:18:28.459]  It was just incredible to have people on there.
[02:18:28.479 --> 02:18:39.789]  But we all agreed that there's definitely second and third and fourth waves coming, whether it's of the virus or of more oppression or more censorship or vilification of our characters if we're at the front.
[02:18:40.310 --> 02:18:42.452]  And so they were ready for that next phase.
[02:18:42.492 --> 02:18:50.479]  But the problem is, Alex, it's very hard to have those real conversations now because the distance, the masks and all of our connection, which is now digital,
[02:18:51.039 --> 02:18:51.199]  I think?
[02:19:08.607 --> 02:19:14.571]  That by banning you or me, they were actually going to make us even more attractive and more well watched.
[02:19:14.731 --> 02:19:16.352]  So the game continues.
[02:19:16.752 --> 02:19:19.653]  Again, I'm super optimistic, but we have to stay three steps ahead.
[02:19:19.934 --> 02:19:21.775]  Just like you said, you're changing URLs.
[02:19:22.095 --> 02:19:23.896]  We're constantly changing tech platforms.
[02:19:24.156 --> 02:19:25.897]  We're changing payment platforms.
[02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.258]  We're changing locations.
[02:19:27.618 --> 02:19:29.439]  You got to stay a couple steps ahead of them.
[02:19:29.479 --> 02:19:31.861]  They're not as smart as you think they are, though, are they, Alex?
[02:19:31.901 --> 02:19:32.321]  They're not.
[02:19:32.641 --> 02:19:33.782]  But you got to stay ahead of them.
[02:19:34.162 --> 02:19:34.742]  Absolutely.
[02:19:34.762 --> 02:19:35.883]  And that was my next point is,
[02:19:38.604 --> 02:19:39.646]  I'm sure you're going through this.
[02:19:39.686 --> 02:19:41.889]  They're going after the payment processors, hammering the banks.
[02:19:42.009 --> 02:19:46.054]  I mean, this is a nightmare situation, but it just makes us stronger to have to be nimble.
[02:19:46.975 --> 02:19:47.636]  But looking at...
[02:19:48.786 --> 02:19:55.329]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who you interviewed, with there in Germany probably a half million people, a million person marches in Germany.
[02:19:55.369 --> 02:19:57.611]  David Icke, that giant event, that giant march.
[02:19:57.871 --> 02:20:00.432]  They persecute the guy, they find the guy that has the event.
[02:20:00.752 --> 02:20:02.153]  That only blows up in their face bigger.
[02:20:03.173 --> 02:20:05.375]  You weren't getting involved in politics.
[02:20:05.435 --> 02:20:08.336]  You were already successful until you saw people being oppressed.
[02:20:08.756 --> 02:20:13.499]  So, when I say Operation Sleeping Giant, you know, Brian Rose and the Sleeping Giant awakens.
[02:20:13.959 --> 02:20:17.462]  Can you speak that, and like use that term if you want, I'll put it on the front of the interview, I'm going to post it.
[02:20:17.842 --> 02:20:28.250]  But I mean, or do you agree that you're the archetypal thing, like you weren't in politics because there wasn't a need, it wasn't until you saw people were being penalized for the, as a fighter, you got in the fight.
[02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:41.560]  Because it's going to be that type of move, suppressing people, is actually going to trigger the resistance, and the globalists, just like Hitler bombing London at the beginning of World War II, thinking it would make them give up, it actually made Londoners go from being anti-war to pro-war.
[02:20:43.348 --> 02:20:45.549]  Yeah, there's that expression, let sleeping dogs lie.
[02:20:45.569 --> 02:20:48.191]  And they picked the wrong person to fight with.
[02:20:48.211 --> 02:20:51.393]  They picked the wrong group to fight with, which is us, looking forward.
[02:20:51.453 --> 02:20:53.895]  And you're right, it's been a complete obsurgence.
[02:20:53.995 --> 02:20:58.377]  Like you said, if you saw my show a year ago, you would have never necessarily seen this coming, right?
[02:20:58.417 --> 02:21:02.200]  I was having real conversation with real people, putting out positive ideas to transform your life.
[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:05.441]  But this is my calling, obviously, Alex.
[02:21:05.501 --> 02:21:06.901]  I've never felt more alive.
[02:21:07.201 --> 02:21:08.382]  I've never felt more support.
[02:21:08.622 --> 02:21:09.582]  There's hard days, too.
[02:21:09.622 --> 02:21:10.382]  I won't lie to you.
[02:21:10.743 --> 02:21:12.903]  But it's still all worth it and invigorating.
[02:21:13.143 --> 02:21:17.105]  And if I die tomorrow, Alex, I'll feel like I did something important on this planet.
[02:21:17.425 --> 02:21:18.845]  And we're seeing that from everyone here.
[02:21:18.865 --> 02:21:21.466]  And to be able to associate with those great guests, like you said,
[02:21:21.826 --> 02:21:23.587]  You know, Robert Kennedy on stage in Germany.
[02:21:23.927 --> 02:21:31.129]  The science that he drops, literally, when it comes to everything he knows about his fight and his, you know, bringing a lot of that knowledge out.
[02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:34.610]  It's important to be around these people and them coming on the platform.
[02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:38.951]  You know, we've had, you know, congressmen come on our platform, Nobel Prize winners.
[02:21:39.391 --> 02:21:40.072]  They're coming on here.
[02:21:40.132 --> 02:21:41.452]  Peter Hitchens here in London.
[02:21:42.132 --> 02:21:46.274]  Really notable people that are coming on my platform to give us that voice of confidence.
[02:21:46.314 --> 02:21:47.214]  So, you know,
[02:21:47.854 --> 02:21:49.935]  They went too far in picking this fight.
[02:21:51.116 --> 02:21:51.896]  But that's what they do.
[02:21:51.976 --> 02:21:52.817]  They make mistakes.
[02:21:53.097 --> 02:21:54.558]  Because they try to oppress us all.
[02:21:54.978 --> 02:21:57.419]  And when someone fights back, they don't really know what to do.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.380]  But we have to stay one step ahead.
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:01.942]  And that's what we're trying to do every single day here.
[02:22:02.222 --> 02:22:03.162]  And that's my last point.
[02:22:03.222 --> 02:22:04.063]  The four minutes we have left.
[02:22:05.504 --> 02:22:26.338]  Obviously there's racial issues, obviously this group's done that, this other group's done this, but the great game of the establishment creating divide and conquer, trying to create race war, trying to make men and women fight with each other, when the whole globalist system is anti-human and anti-prosperity and anti-freedom, we should all see the manipulation and come together against this system.
[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:31.121]  Yeah, all of these things are being used as weapons against us.
[02:22:31.561 --> 02:22:38.004]  Race, identity, sexuality, all of these things, even COVID itself, is being used as a weapon of fear.
[02:22:38.344 --> 02:22:41.606]  And this is the message we've had here at London Real, and David Icke says this all the time.
[02:22:41.946 --> 02:22:45.747]  If you come out of this, and I know it might sound corny, Alex, out of love.
[02:22:46.148 --> 02:22:46.848]  Move forward.
[02:22:47.388 --> 02:22:48.109]  Not in fear.
[02:22:48.529 --> 02:22:50.071]  That is where they can't fight you.
[02:22:50.231 --> 02:22:51.532]  And that's where they can't divide us.
[02:22:51.672 --> 02:22:57.598]  But right now, they got us busy on all these other things that are dividing us, and we're picking sides, and it's your team and my team.
[02:22:57.878 --> 02:23:00.120]  They're gonna win every single time when they do that, Alex.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:06.185]  But if we try to go for Team Human, move forward, look at our basic, fundamental human right.
[02:23:06.646 --> 02:23:07.647]  Freedom of speech.
[02:23:08.087 --> 02:23:09.088]  It's so basic!
[02:23:09.348 --> 02:23:13.272]  The fact that that's being taken away from us on a daily basis should be enough of a red flag.
[02:23:13.812 --> 02:23:15.454]  Look, we all need to get on Team Human.
[02:23:15.734 --> 02:23:20.058]  We need to move forward and find the solutions and see the little mind games they're playing with us.
[02:23:20.118 --> 02:23:21.399]  I think people are seeing it.
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:25.423]  But when you have hatred and anger, you know, everything goes down to the amygdala.
[02:23:25.483 --> 02:23:26.204]  Alex, you know that.
[02:23:26.464 --> 02:23:27.705]  And you can't think rationally.
[02:23:27.745 --> 02:23:30.908]  People need to take a breath and say, what's the real agenda here?
[02:23:31.188 --> 02:23:33.310]  Oh, they're making me do something I don't want to do.
[02:23:33.330 --> 02:23:35.352]  I want to act independently.
[02:23:35.392 --> 02:23:37.214]  I want to move forward with solutions.
[02:23:37.794 --> 02:23:39.236]  Let's make this planet better.
[02:23:39.256 --> 02:23:43.682]  I think when people make that decision, then we're all on the same wavelength.
[02:23:44.483 --> 02:23:45.043]  Exactly.
[02:23:45.144 --> 02:23:48.207]  I mean, the Germans tried to arrest people six months ago, three months ago.
[02:23:48.688 --> 02:23:50.050]  Now it only makes the crowds bigger.
[02:23:50.430 --> 02:23:51.171]  That's the answer.
[02:23:51.211 --> 02:23:53.915]  That's the human answer is, now you can't arrest a million people.
[02:23:55.908 --> 02:24:02.150]  Yeah, and look, if we come out of this message of let's move forward, not out of fear, but out of love, and that's the thing.
[02:24:02.471 --> 02:24:05.932]  We have never advocated violence here, the overthrow of government, the destruction of poverty.
[02:24:06.152 --> 02:24:06.392]  Never.
[02:24:06.712 --> 02:24:11.494]  It's all about having conversations, and I try to present a marketplace of ideas, Alex.
[02:24:11.514 --> 02:24:11.934]  So do you.
[02:24:12.274 --> 02:24:13.555]  Let the best idea win.
[02:24:13.635 --> 02:24:15.536]  Let's debate it, and let's agree upon it.
[02:24:15.556 --> 02:24:18.117]  Oh yeah, people ask me, like, wait, you had a guest on that disagreed with the other guest.
[02:24:18.157 --> 02:24:19.157]  I'm not running a damn cult.
[02:24:19.697 --> 02:24:21.138]  Of course we're getting a bunch of ideas out here.
[02:24:21.738 --> 02:24:22.959]  Because I respect the viewer.
[02:24:23.399 --> 02:24:24.299]  I respect the listener.
[02:24:24.319 --> 02:24:24.779]  Exactly.
[02:24:24.799 --> 02:24:26.200]  We're putting a bunch of ideas out here.
[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:28.301]  Because I'm just like you.
[02:24:28.361 --> 02:24:29.702]  I'm trying to figure out for myself.
[02:24:30.722 --> 02:24:30.882]  Yeah.
[02:24:31.122 --> 02:24:32.703]  We put lots of different ideas here.
[02:24:32.743 --> 02:24:35.364]  We get people to argue with each other and it's a marketplace of ideas.
[02:24:35.404 --> 02:24:38.586]  The best idea rises to the top and that's what we want here.
[02:24:38.646 --> 02:24:41.147]  That's what we want to prevail and move forward.
[02:24:41.747 --> 02:24:44.448]  But we just don't always see that happening and that's what we want to present.
[02:24:44.709 --> 02:24:45.529]  The best idea.
[02:24:45.829 --> 02:24:49.551]  Let's have a healthy debate and move forward with a data driven approach.
[02:24:50.271 --> 02:24:51.592]  It's not rocket science, Alex.
[02:24:51.972 --> 02:24:56.456]  You know, it's marked the upsurge of all human civilization, what we're talking about here.
[02:24:56.756 --> 02:25:00.018]  And yet that's being suppressed right now in literally an information war.
[02:25:00.379 --> 02:25:01.339]  You saw this coming, Alex.
[02:25:01.359 --> 02:25:02.861]  That's why you named your show after this.
[02:25:03.521 --> 02:25:06.964]  And look, I just want to thank you for being a pioneer and for supporting us.
[02:25:07.004 --> 02:25:10.486]  People have no idea the support you've given me behind the scenes and on your show.
[02:25:10.967 --> 02:25:16.771]  And I just want to pay it forward to the next digital freedom fighter that's going to go out there and do the same kind of thing we're doing.
[02:25:16.931 --> 02:25:18.012]  We appreciate you, Brian.
[02:25:18.052 --> 02:25:18.752]  You're kicking ass.
[02:25:19.893 --> 02:25:21.134]  This is the time, folks.
[02:25:21.174 --> 02:25:22.555]  This is humanity.
[02:25:22.595 --> 02:25:23.436]  This is our future.
[02:25:23.756 --> 02:25:24.577]  This is everything.
[02:25:24.597 --> 02:25:29.621]  And that's why every person you talk to, every person you share information with, listeners and viewers, changes the world.
[02:25:29.701 --> 02:25:31.243]  It's so beautiful, the power you've got.
[02:25:31.543 --> 02:25:32.724]  So we salute the listeners and viewers.
[02:25:33.084 --> 02:25:33.965]  Brian, thank you so much.
[02:25:33.985 --> 02:25:35.166]  I look forward to being on your show Wednesday.
[02:25:36.307 --> 02:25:36.787]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:25:36.827 --> 02:25:37.548]  I look forward to having you.
[02:25:37.748 --> 02:25:38.169]  Thank you, brother.
[02:25:38.489 --> 02:25:38.809]  All right.
[02:25:38.849 --> 02:25:42.872]  Gerald Cilente is in there like a raging bull in that...
[02:25:43.826 --> 02:25:46.750]  In that shoot, they're about to open the gates, about to bust out in four minutes.
[02:25:47.271 --> 02:25:47.671]  Amazing.
[02:25:47.711 --> 02:25:50.215]  And then, The War Room, Orange-Troyer, 3 p.m.
[02:25:50.275 --> 02:25:51.817]  Central, then 7 p.m.
[02:25:52.197 --> 02:25:55.021]  Election Countdown, tonight, InfoWars.com.
[02:25:55.081 --> 02:25:57.124]  Only way the dog hunts is you share those links.
[02:25:57.524 --> 02:25:58.666]  Wow, great job of the crew.
[02:25:59.046 --> 02:26:00.788]  We'll be right back with Gerald Cilente.
[02:26:04.022 --> 02:26:07.424]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:26:07.444 --> 02:26:08.605]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:26:08.625 --> 02:26:10.206]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:26:10.226 --> 02:26:11.727]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:26:11.827 --> 02:26:12.847]  I want them shut down.
[02:26:12.927 --> 02:26:13.828]  I want them silenced.
[02:26:13.888 --> 02:26:14.668]  I want them muted.
[02:26:14.708 --> 02:26:16.490]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:26:16.530 --> 02:26:17.470]  You kept us on air.
[02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:18.891]  We did the analysis first.
[02:26:19.151 --> 02:26:20.152]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:26:20.212 --> 02:26:22.033]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:26:22.293 --> 02:26:28.237]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:26:28.417 --> 02:26:29.878]  And you need to stop right now.
[02:26:29.958 --> 02:26:31.018]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:26:31.178 --> 02:26:33.560]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:34.441]  This is not going to happen.
[02:26:34.481 --> 02:26:36.362]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[02:26:36.843 --> 02:26:37.944]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[02:26:38.404 --> 02:26:39.305]  Rescue InfoWars.
[02:26:39.385 --> 02:26:40.025]  Save yourself.
[02:26:40.386 --> 02:26:41.026]  Save the world.
[02:26:41.326 --> 02:26:42.187]  We're in this together.
[02:26:42.207 --> 02:26:43.928]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:26:43.968 --> 02:26:44.949]  Communism's up here.
[02:26:45.149 --> 02:26:48.092]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[02:26:48.492 --> 02:26:50.314]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:26:50.534 --> 02:26:52.075]  My children are right here!
[02:26:52.796 --> 02:26:54.577]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:26:54.737 --> 02:26:55.798]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:26:56.018 --> 02:26:56.919]  And I need prayer!
[02:26:57.059 --> 02:26:58.020]  And I need action!
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:26:59.982]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[02:27:00.702 --> 02:27:02.644]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[02:27:03.715 --> 02:27:04.816]  Hey, hello, hello.
[02:27:05.036 --> 02:27:07.478]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:08.639 --> 02:27:10.780]  Real pleasure and an honor.
[02:27:11.941 --> 02:27:26.072]  Because Infowars is keeping the truth alive while the prostitutes keep getting paid to put out what they're told to get paid for by their corporate foremasters.
[02:27:26.853 --> 02:27:28.794]  So it's great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:29.815 --> 02:27:33.238]  And today we're making a
[02:27:34.577 --> 02:27:40.180]  Follow up to our forecast, which was one of our top trends for 2020.
[02:27:41.501 --> 02:27:43.883]  Trump.
[02:27:43.903 --> 02:27:45.724]  2020 by default.
[02:27:47.205 --> 02:27:52.108]  And it was the default of the demo craps that they didn't have anybody good to run against him.
[02:27:52.748 --> 02:27:56.270]  We made this forecast back in December of 2019.
[02:27:56.510 --> 02:28:00.052]  That's when we make them for the coming year.
[02:28:00.853 --> 02:28:02.534]  And we stand by that forecast.
[02:28:05.202 --> 02:28:09.983]  The big news, of course, is today part of the big news is that group 538.
[02:28:12.564 --> 02:28:18.006]  Biden is favored to win the election.
[02:28:19.786 --> 02:28:27.128]  We think 538 is 100% wrong.
[02:28:28.869 --> 02:28:32.690]  And we're forecasting, we maintain our forecast that
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:37.603]  Trump is going to win the 2020 election.
[02:28:37.623 --> 02:28:48.970]  In our staff meetings, I had mentioned over and over again why and how Trump would win.
[02:28:50.451 --> 02:28:53.253]  Matter of fact, the covers of the Trends Journal also say it.
[02:28:54.414 --> 02:29:02.159]  He's playing to the audience that doesn't believe in getting locked down and have their rights robbed from them.
[02:29:03.288 --> 02:29:05.610]  It's going to be part of the election.
[02:29:07.051 --> 02:29:31.891]  And if you read an analysis, for instance, in the toilet paper of record today, they make it clear from their perspective that if the coronavirus is the issue, as the demo craps are playing, Trump will lose on that point.
[02:29:33.390 --> 02:29:38.792]  And we're saying absolutely got it 180% wrong.
[02:29:40.413 --> 02:29:48.676]  The more Biden plays the coronavirus card, the stronger it is for Trump.
[02:29:53.358 --> 02:30:00.961]  And we had said in our staff meetings that that's exactly what Trump was going to do.
[02:30:01.696 --> 02:30:03.657]  So what happened yesterday in Las Vegas?
[02:30:04.438 --> 02:30:06.239]  This is from the Associated Press.
[02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:19.027]  In open defiance of state regulations, in open defiance of state regulations, how dare you defy the Lord King, a governor crapster!
[02:30:19.627 --> 02:30:27.272]  Like we got over here in New York, the Andy Cuomo boy, you know, the boy born on third base and thought he had a home run.
[02:30:29.369 --> 02:30:47.034]  Gerald Cilenti on July 4th to celebrate Independence Day held a rally here in Kingston in the Crown Garden on the most historic four corners in America, the four corners of freedom, in defiance of little Andy Cuomo.
[02:30:47.074 --> 02:30:49.675]  I said, come over here, boy, and try to close me down.
[02:30:50.596 --> 02:30:52.336]  No, no, leave your goons behind.
[02:30:52.716 --> 02:30:53.837]  You just come around.
[02:30:53.857 --> 02:30:56.897]  Of course, they didn't.
[02:30:57.278 --> 02:30:58.338]  And the Kingston police
[02:30:59.005 --> 02:31:01.106]  These cats are real men and women.
[02:31:01.886 --> 02:31:03.726]  They don't bother you for a little garbage.
[02:31:04.767 --> 02:31:05.747]  They left us alone.
[02:31:06.467 --> 02:31:27.013]  Going back to this AP story, in defiance of state regulations, President Donald Trump hosted his first indoor rally since June, telling a packed, nearly maskless Nevada crowd that the nation was, quote, making the last turn in defeating the virus.
[02:31:28.709 --> 02:31:30.531]  Again, we were maskless up here.
[02:31:32.772 --> 02:31:33.533]  We all died.
[02:31:34.834 --> 02:31:36.515]  This is not Gerald Cilenti.
[02:31:36.535 --> 02:31:40.358]  They made me up over there in Silicon Valley.
[02:31:40.398 --> 02:31:41.639]  They made a new Cilenti.
[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:43.921]  This is not really me.
[02:31:45.162 --> 02:31:46.764]  The newspapers went after us.
[02:31:46.864 --> 02:31:48.125]  Everybody went after us.
[02:31:49.286 --> 02:31:51.387]  And they're going after Trump the same way.
[02:31:53.609 --> 02:31:56.972]  Trump said, quote, we are not shutting the country again.
[02:31:58.138 --> 02:32:11.725]  A shutdown would destroy the lives and dreams of millions of Americans, said Trump before using his inflammatory moniker for the coronavirus.
[02:32:13.406 --> 02:32:14.186]  What does that mean?
[02:32:15.206 --> 02:32:18.168]  Using his inflammatory moniker for the coronavirus.
[02:32:20.129 --> 02:32:20.429]  Anyway.
[02:32:25.472 --> 02:32:41.939]  He's going to, very simply, continue to quote little Joey Biden, who says that, if the scientists tell me so, I'll close down the nation.
[02:32:43.220 --> 02:32:43.700]  Got it?
[02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:45.721]  The scientists?
[02:32:46.601 --> 02:32:47.781]  What scientists?
[02:32:48.802 --> 02:32:50.923]  A bunch of bureaucratic hacks?
[02:32:51.644 --> 02:32:56.527]  Little low lives who get the job because they sucked up or bowed down and got it?
[02:32:58.929 --> 02:32:59.469]  You got it.
[02:32:59.489 --> 02:33:00.510]  It's right there.
[02:33:01.170 --> 02:33:15.038]  This is going to be election between the masked, like the Biden crowd, like all the cowardly liberals running around, and the unmasked.
[02:33:16.499 --> 02:33:20.722]  The men and women of the United States of America
[02:33:22.685 --> 02:33:24.926]  In order to form a more perfect union.
[02:33:26.526 --> 02:33:27.027]  Freedom!
[02:33:28.447 --> 02:33:30.268]  Freedom to live the way you want.
[02:33:30.728 --> 02:33:35.430]  Again, our Trends Journal Weekly Magazine has all the data.
[02:33:36.350 --> 02:33:37.310]  By the numbers.
[02:33:38.411 --> 02:33:39.471]  Only by the numbers.
[02:33:42.092 --> 02:33:43.533]  The people who are dying.
[02:33:43.553 --> 02:33:46.234]  The people who are dying.
[02:33:49.055 --> 02:33:51.136]  Worldwide, over 50% from nursing homes.
[02:33:54.039 --> 02:33:55.859]  With pre-existing chronic conditions.
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:33:58.700]  So now you cut that number out.
[02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:01.461]  Then you go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[02:34:01.481 --> 02:34:17.684]  94% of the people who died had coronavirus, but also 2.6 other pre-existing chronic conditions.
[02:34:20.024 --> 02:34:23.105]  So, if they died from suicide,
[02:34:23.962 --> 02:34:24.822]  Or something else.
[02:34:27.044 --> 02:34:29.125]  They're listed as dying from the virus.
[02:34:29.165 --> 02:34:33.707]  But even taking that out and let's say that they all did die from the virus.
[02:34:35.448 --> 02:34:38.690]  They had pre-existing conditions like obesity.
[02:34:40.430 --> 02:34:42.912]  Of which 42% of Americans have.
[02:34:44.092 --> 02:34:44.653]  Overweight.
[02:34:45.973 --> 02:34:46.754]  Lung disorder.
[02:34:46.794 --> 02:34:47.534]  Keeps smoking.
[02:34:51.476 --> 02:34:53.137]  Trump is going to win on this issue.
[02:34:54.892 --> 02:34:56.552]  And there's a very simple reason why.
[02:34:56.572 --> 02:34:59.333]  He has to win the swing states.
[02:35:01.233 --> 02:35:04.234]  And he has to get more people to go out and vote than voted the last time.
[02:35:05.774 --> 02:35:07.015]  He's going to get that crowd.
[02:35:08.175 --> 02:35:13.696]  Because now there's really an issue between them and us.
[02:35:18.257 --> 02:35:18.737]  Hang on.
[02:35:19.398 --> 02:35:19.858]  Stay tuned.
[02:35:22.182 --> 02:35:25.565]  Hello, hello, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:35:27.206 --> 02:35:45.140]  And staying with that AP report on President Trump's rally yesterday in Nevada, after he says, this is the way it came as they wrote it, we're not shutting down the country again, a shutdown would destroy the lives and dreams of millions of Americans.
[02:35:47.722 --> 02:35:51.945]  They go on to say he didn't mention the pandemic's death total.
[02:35:52.699 --> 02:35:57.901]  It killed more than 200,000 Americans and still claiming about a thousand lives a day.
[02:35:58.862 --> 02:36:01.683]  So that, right there, is propaganda.
[02:36:03.724 --> 02:36:16.389]  That's the reporter, or I should say the prostitute, Jonathan Lemire, or Ken Ritter, that stuck that line in there, or maybe their boss has told them to put it in there.
[02:36:17.089 --> 02:36:20.671]  Because that has nothing to do with what Trump is saying.
[02:36:21.787 --> 02:36:25.809]  About a shutdown would destroy the lives and dreams of millions of Americans.
[02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:29.951]  So 200,000 Americans dead.
[02:36:32.313 --> 02:36:35.735]  Almost 100,000 of those, again, are from nursing homes.
[02:36:37.315 --> 02:36:42.158]  And only 4% of the people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
[02:36:45.208 --> 02:36:48.910]  Did not have pre-existing chronic conditions that died of the virus.
[02:36:49.430 --> 02:37:01.455]  And again, these numbers are inflated because they're not doing complete studies on who actually died from the virus or a pre-existing chronic condition.
[02:37:02.135 --> 02:37:03.816]  But we'll even keep it at that number.
[02:37:06.617 --> 02:37:12.400]  And when you take 96% of that out of it, you don't have a lot of people.
[02:37:13.581 --> 02:37:23.827]  And you don't close down an entire economy that's destroying the lives of hundreds of millions, billions people around the planet.
[02:37:25.568 --> 02:37:28.149]  We're coming out with our new trends journal tomorrow.
[02:37:28.489 --> 02:37:35.373]  It's a weekly, as you know, we went from a quarterly to a monthly to a weekly.
[02:37:35.393 --> 02:37:39.916]  And what we're doing here
[02:37:40.777 --> 02:37:44.899]  Is the reason I had to go to weekly is because events are changing so rapidly.
[02:37:45.820 --> 02:37:55.625]  So one of the stories are about COVID lockdowns increased drug abuse.
[02:37:59.647 --> 02:38:01.167]  It increases drug abuse.
[02:38:01.227 --> 02:38:03.929]  We warned about these rising crime
[02:38:05.043 --> 02:38:07.944]  Waves that would happen as people lose everything.
[02:38:07.964 --> 02:38:09.365]  I have nothing left to lose.
[02:38:09.965 --> 02:38:16.168]  None of these issues were looked upon as they started locking down everything.
[02:38:16.188 --> 02:38:17.009]  And there you have it.
[02:38:17.889 --> 02:38:19.690]  It's clear as can be.
[02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:33.236]  They all they do is they take actions when they started the covid war like they start other wars without any assessment of the implications or an exit strategy.
[02:38:34.844 --> 02:38:36.364]  And that's where we're at now.
[02:38:38.105 --> 02:38:42.665]  And I want to talk a bit before I get into that just quickly before I do forget.
[02:38:43.746 --> 02:38:48.086]  As InfoWars listeners well know.
[02:38:49.907 --> 02:38:52.787]  I had forecast a rise in gold prices.
[02:38:55.968 --> 02:38:58.448]  Back in June of 2019.
[02:38:58.648 --> 02:39:01.389]  Our trend forecast was the gold bull run.
[02:39:04.662 --> 02:39:06.844]  Gold was at $1,332 an ounce back then.
[02:39:06.904 --> 02:39:16.410]  But pay to subscribe to the Trends Journal, because now gold, as we speak, is around $19.67.
[02:39:16.730 --> 02:39:20.473]  The year I was born!
[02:39:20.493 --> 02:39:21.554]  Well, not really.
[02:39:21.694 --> 02:39:25.456]  It was a couple of decades before then.
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:32.121]  Gold is going to go
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:38.464]  I believe into the two to three even four thousand dollar an ounce mark.
[02:39:40.086 --> 02:39:40.566]  Silver.
[02:39:43.108 --> 02:39:46.411]  This past June when it was selling for.
[02:39:46.431 --> 02:39:50.694]  At seventeen dollars and fifty cents an ounce.
[02:39:52.215 --> 02:39:56.619]  I said it would spike higher in percentage points than gold.
[02:39:57.860 --> 02:40:00.682]  And now we're looking at silver at around twenty seven
[02:40:03.275 --> 02:40:04.936]  50 an ounce.
[02:40:07.977 --> 02:40:09.537]  Gone up $10 an ounce.
[02:40:11.538 --> 02:40:16.060]  The markets, as you well know, are totally and artificially inflated.
[02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:24.142]  We have Gregory Manorino writing for us as well that backs up what we've been saying for a long time with more details.
[02:40:26.143 --> 02:40:31.845]  We are going to go into or get hit by
[02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:38.434]  An economic tsunami like it's never been experienced in the world.
[02:40:40.236 --> 02:40:43.258]  They've locked down much of the global economy.
[02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:47.501]  It doesn't snap back.
[02:40:49.223 --> 02:40:58.169]  And, what InfoWar warriors and subscribers to the Trends Journal well know, the economy was slowing down before this happened.
[02:41:01.412 --> 02:41:02.613]  Go back, look at the data.
[02:41:03.587 --> 02:41:08.771]  2019?
[02:41:03.727 --> 02:41:08.771]  Oh, that place called India, one of the world's largest economies?
[02:41:09.592 --> 02:41:10.993]  Huh, how far down was it?
[02:41:11.533 --> 02:41:15.416]  Only had seven consecutive orders of declining gross domestic product.
[02:41:17.498 --> 02:41:17.958]  China?
[02:41:18.599 --> 02:41:22.281]  Oh yeah, its GDP was at 19, rose at 1999 levels.
[02:41:23.462 --> 02:41:24.303]  Slowing down.
[02:41:27.025 --> 02:41:28.826]  Mexico, heading into recession.
[02:41:28.886 --> 02:41:29.987]  Japan, recession.
[02:41:30.007 --> 02:41:30.668]  This is 2019!
[02:41:32.867 --> 02:41:35.269]  This is before they locked down everything!
[02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:45.996]  Trump is 100% correct, and I don't agree with him, as Alex Jones, Wells Know, and Infowarriors know, on a number of issues.
[02:41:48.438 --> 02:41:52.141]  Totally opposed to what he's doing with Iran and Venezuela.
[02:41:54.102 --> 02:41:59.066]  Totally support Trump on closing the borders.
[02:42:01.434 --> 02:42:05.458]  Take care of our own before we bring in other people and we can't take care of our own already.
[02:42:06.379 --> 02:42:08.581]  And I agree with him and his trade policy.
[02:42:09.501 --> 02:42:10.722]  And I think it is even.
[02:42:11.763 --> 02:42:13.605]  My trade policy goes beyond his.
[02:42:14.105 --> 02:42:23.174]  I say bring back everything that existed before NAFTA and letting China into the World Trade Organization and just put that back on the on the road again.
[02:42:24.655 --> 02:42:25.296]  So anyway.
[02:42:26.517 --> 02:42:27.758]  I totally agree with him.
[02:42:29.208 --> 02:42:31.410]  On not locking down the economy.
[02:42:33.552 --> 02:42:42.659]  This is going to destroy more lives by hundreds of millions than the coronavirus will kill people.
[02:42:45.161 --> 02:42:48.183]  People have put all their lives into building their businesses, gone.
[02:42:50.065 --> 02:42:54.088]  People living paycheck to paycheck, as we know, was it some 70% of Americans
[02:42:56.266 --> 02:43:02.527]  Don't have $400 extra or something like that, whatever the percentage is, in case of an emergency.
[02:43:05.188 --> 02:43:06.228]  And now they're out of work.
[02:43:07.168 --> 02:43:08.408]  And now the money's running out.
[02:43:10.729 --> 02:43:14.730]  Again, this election is going to be very clear on a major point.
[02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:18.271]  It's going to be masks or no masks.
[02:43:19.931 --> 02:43:22.051]  And I want to mention something else as well.
[02:43:24.612 --> 02:43:25.412]  It's about Biden.
[02:43:27.068 --> 02:43:28.990]  It's about what no one is talking about.
[02:43:31.512 --> 02:43:39.739]  It's what Biden did that's hurt so many people in so many different ways.
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:53.532]  But now the two-faced boy is forgetting all about what he said and did back then that we're going to bring up right now.
[02:43:55.998 --> 02:43:57.738]  That no one in the media is talking about.
[02:43:58.839 --> 02:44:03.059]  That's going to cost Biden a lot of votes.
[02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:05.260]  No, no, no.
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:10.061]  It doesn't have anything to do with his three strikes you're out and throwing people in jail.
[02:44:11.361 --> 02:44:17.582]  And the Clinton administration creating the prison industrial complex.
[02:44:18.583 --> 02:44:20.823]  Now, it's even beyond that.
[02:44:22.023 --> 02:44:22.524]  What is it?
[02:44:23.404 --> 02:44:24.764]  How is it going to help Trump?
[02:44:26.237 --> 02:44:27.598]  It's going to help him in a big way.
[02:44:29.419 --> 02:44:32.020]  It's going to help him particularly among the younger voters.
[02:44:33.661 --> 02:44:35.982]  No, they're not going to go out and vote for him, for Trump.
[02:44:36.743 --> 02:44:41.565]  But they're not going to run out and vote for Biden because what he did to them.
[02:44:42.145 --> 02:44:43.946]  And they're still paying for it.
[02:44:44.527 --> 02:44:45.227]  Big time.
[02:44:45.907 --> 02:44:47.668]  When we come back, we'll tell you what it is.
[02:44:48.669 --> 02:44:49.709]  Hello, hello.
[02:44:50.050 --> 02:44:52.231]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.

[02:44:58.992 --> 02:45:02.374]  So you have to save on InfoWars.

[02:45:17.902 --> 02:45:21.524]  And it's going to require support for those who want to fight for it.
[02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:26.312]  Again, either fight for it or go down with the demo craps.

[02:46:35.798 --> 02:46:38.560]  And again, you got to build your immune system.
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:40.581]  Get strong.
[02:46:41.442 --> 02:46:43.283]  That's how you beat the virus.
[02:46:44.824 --> 02:46:46.766]  And that's how you beat other things as well.
[02:46:46.846 --> 02:46:51.069]  By the way, I also the first book I worked on was called Natural Healing.
[02:46:52.023 --> 02:46:59.168]  And I have an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences for the work I've done in complementary and integrated medicine.
[02:46:59.909 --> 02:47:02.891]  So I believe in building the immune system.
[02:47:02.911 --> 02:47:05.953]  I'm not a vaccination kind of guy.
[02:47:07.794 --> 02:47:17.661]  So I was saying before, there's a Trump card that's going to be played against Biden that nobody anywhere, any place is talking about.
[02:47:19.102 --> 02:47:19.923]  We have it right here.
[02:47:21.104 --> 02:47:21.544]  What is it?
[02:47:22.990 --> 02:47:25.192]  Send $29.95 to TrendsJournal.
[02:47:25.232 --> 02:47:26.052]  I'm only kidding.
[02:47:26.072 --> 02:47:26.713]  I'm only kidding.
[02:47:28.634 --> 02:47:52.332]  In 2005, this is going to be in tomorrow's TrendsJournal, as a senator from Delaware, where the financial industry is among the state's largest, Biden was a strong proponent of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which prevented people with student loans from escaping them through bankruptcy.
[02:47:54.025 --> 02:47:54.465]  Got it.
[02:47:56.586 --> 02:48:11.713]  Biden also backed the 1998 law mandating that student loans could be erased through bankruptcy only when the debtor could prove that loans were, quote, an undue hardship.
[02:48:13.914 --> 02:48:23.139]  A term the law did not define, but many courts interpreted the law to mean that the debtor had to prove that their financial circumstances would never change
[02:48:24.522 --> 02:48:28.204]  For the better, leading one judge to rule, you ready for this?
[02:48:30.605 --> 02:48:44.593]  That a disabled 45-year-old woman, whose entire yearly income was $10,000, failed to prove that her lingering student loan debt was an undue burden.
[02:48:46.074 --> 02:48:53.378]  And, slimy Joe Biden, as the chair of the Senate's Judiciary Committee,
[02:48:54.113 --> 02:49:05.158]  With Green's proposed laws, regulations for the financial industry, he helped make it more difficult for American borrowers to claim bankruptcy.
[02:49:07.079 --> 02:49:17.003]  With those protections in place, banks made student loans more freely because there was less chance that borrowers could escape their obligations.
[02:49:17.643 --> 02:49:21.285]  And you can see exactly what happens when you look at that chart.
[02:49:22.202 --> 02:49:36.130]  On how more people started borrowing, as banks made it more easy, and they didn't know that they would be paying for these college degrees worth nothing for the rest of their life.
[02:49:36.871 --> 02:49:39.372]  Oh, you mean you don't want to spend, uh, go in debt?
[02:49:40.413 --> 02:49:43.354]  On average, what is it, about thirty-something thousand dollars?
[02:49:44.435 --> 02:49:47.277]  For a degree in gender studies?
[02:49:48.109 --> 02:49:50.691]  No, I would say art history is the one for me.
[02:49:51.272 --> 02:49:53.213]  Well, maybe English literature.
[02:49:53.494 --> 02:49:54.735]  How about history course?
[02:49:56.436 --> 02:49:57.537]  Worthless garbage.
[02:50:00.419 --> 02:50:01.020]  There you got it.
[02:50:01.060 --> 02:50:02.601]  Degrees of debt and regret.
[02:50:04.523 --> 02:50:04.963]  Terrible.
[02:50:05.443 --> 02:50:06.684]  Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[02:50:07.325 --> 02:50:08.846]  Thanks, Joe Biden.
[02:50:09.767 --> 02:50:10.968]  Slimy Joe.
[02:50:11.588 --> 02:50:16.893]  Slick Willie's brother-in-law by marriage of
[02:50:17.802 --> 02:50:21.905]  The worst degree in terms of shafting it to the people.
[02:50:23.106 --> 02:50:25.168]  And how those dumbo craps love them.
[02:50:26.049 --> 02:50:29.712]  Oh yes, look Willie Clinton, why'd he got all those drug ads on TV?
[02:50:29.732 --> 02:50:30.392]  Huh.
[02:50:30.412 --> 02:50:32.354]  Of course the Clinton allowed them in 1997.
[02:50:32.814 --> 02:50:40.020]  Hey, what happened to all the privately owned radio stations and TV stations around America?
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:46.325]  Well, it was that Clinton-Biden team and all the rest that did away with the Federal Communications Act.
[02:50:47.421 --> 02:50:48.802]  That allowed the bigs to get bigger.
[02:50:51.384 --> 02:50:52.925]  Yep, one after another.
[02:50:54.146 --> 02:51:01.372]  So, at this point, as I see it, it's Biden.
[02:51:02.533 --> 02:51:02.693]  Out.
[02:51:03.774 --> 02:51:04.034]  Trump.
[02:51:04.835 --> 02:51:04.995]  In.
[02:51:05.015 --> 02:51:04.995]  2020.
[02:51:05.615 --> 02:51:13.822]  What the media forgets, and that us New Yorkers know, it's a different kind of cat, man.
[02:51:14.628 --> 02:51:19.609]  You know, back in the old days, you would never call names to a contender.
[02:51:19.649 --> 02:51:21.110]  That would be improper.
[02:51:21.970 --> 02:51:26.471]  But in New York, it's a different fight.
[02:51:26.491 --> 02:51:29.112]  And Trump has to win the swing state.
[02:51:31.293 --> 02:51:35.034]  What just happened in Wisconsin, that's going to bring out a lot of people.
[02:51:35.994 --> 02:51:37.215]  What happened in Kenosha.
[02:51:39.295 --> 02:51:42.176]  And what else is going on over there?
[02:51:43.430 --> 02:51:44.630]  It's state after state.
[02:51:45.631 --> 02:51:57.315]  He's going to blame witless Whitmer over there in Michigan for destroying the economy by locking it down.
[02:51:57.896 --> 02:51:59.236]  Again, this is in your Trends Journal.
[02:51:59.256 --> 02:52:00.477]  I want to put this in perspective.
[02:52:01.797 --> 02:52:05.299]  Ohio, Ohio, Michigan is locked down.
[02:52:05.319 --> 02:52:07.139]  They have about 10 million people.
[02:52:09.020 --> 02:52:11.461]  And I'm not sure the exact number, but roughly.
[02:52:12.375 --> 02:52:19.739]  About 6,800 deaths attributed, not really claimed scientifically, but attributed to the virus.
[02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:21.700]  And they locked down.
[02:52:23.781 --> 02:52:26.003]  Sweden has the same population.
[02:52:26.023 --> 02:52:28.924]  About 10 million.
[02:52:31.286 --> 02:52:32.706]  They have about 5,300 deaths from the virus.
[02:52:41.673 --> 02:52:44.754]  Over 50% of them came from nursing homes in Sweden.
[02:52:45.674 --> 02:52:53.677]  And in Michigan, a lot of them from Detroit and other areas where people are not in very good health and there's pollution and other things.
[02:52:55.098 --> 02:52:57.238]  Now, Sweden didn't lock down.
[02:53:00.119 --> 02:53:01.320]  And Michigan did.
[02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:04.221]  They have the same population.
[02:53:05.661 --> 02:53:10.343]  And Michigan has, what, about well over a thousand more deaths.
[02:53:12.622 --> 02:53:14.082]  So why not do what Sweden did?
[02:53:15.183 --> 02:53:15.463]  Why?
[02:53:15.523 --> 02:53:19.904]  Because we now are the United Soviet States of America.
[02:53:20.644 --> 02:53:21.524]  You have no freedom.
[02:53:22.924 --> 02:53:29.426]  You got little low lives that Fauci the fraud, the jaw boy, and others are selling the fear and hysteria.
[02:53:31.906 --> 02:53:33.786]  So the election is going to be a lot on that.
[02:53:34.687 --> 02:53:41.268]  And also in this Trends Journal we go into detail about how science is saying
[02:53:42.366 --> 02:53:46.607]  That staying at home and being locked down isn't the thing to do.
[02:53:53.768 --> 02:54:03.710]  Even little Andy Cuomo said back in May, if you notice, 66% of the people were at home that went to hospitals, which is shocking to us.
[02:54:04.590 --> 02:54:05.750]  This is a surprise.
[02:54:06.510 --> 02:54:08.370]  Overwhelmingly, the people were at home.
[02:54:09.091 --> 02:54:11.831]  We thought maybe they were taking public transportation.
[02:54:12.540 --> 02:54:15.481]  And we've taken special precautions on public transportation.
[02:54:15.921 --> 02:54:16.801]  But actually, no.
[02:54:17.522 --> 02:54:19.562]  Because these people are literally at home.
[02:54:20.102 --> 02:54:20.602]  That's right.
[02:54:20.923 --> 02:54:22.343]  And that's what all the data proves.
[02:54:23.263 --> 02:54:29.025]  So these lockdowns in Melbourne, all around the world, are not working.
[02:54:32.086 --> 02:54:34.167]  They're making bad situations worse.
[02:54:36.867 --> 02:54:38.428]  Liberty, love, joy, and beauty.
[02:54:39.348 --> 02:54:41.569]  Let's bring back the American way.
[02:54:43.533 --> 02:54:45.555]  Do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:54:46.656 --> 02:54:51.040]  Go to TrendsJournal.com to look at the Trends Journal and read history before it happens.
[02:54:52.621 --> 02:54:54.563]  And put your money where your mind and heart are.
[02:54:56.224 --> 02:54:58.806]  Be the people that take to the streets to fight for freedom.
[02:54:59.807 --> 02:55:03.631]  Not in a violent way, because I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[02:55:04.531 --> 02:55:05.612]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:55:06.613 --> 02:55:07.314]  See you next week.
[02:55:19.172 --> 02:55:20.433]  Today, Essential Special.
[02:55:20.493 --> 02:55:22.534]  A week ago, it ends on Monday.

[02:55:55.093 --> 02:55:57.856]  They've got 98% reviews all over the internet.
[02:55:58.156 --> 02:56:00.558]  Check it out for yourselves and it funds the InfoWars 360 win.
[02:56:00.578 --> 02:56:03.580]  The only way you lose is not by taking action.
[02:56:03.881 --> 02:56:05.302]  And I want to explain that again.
[02:56:05.602 --> 02:56:07.584]  Your support of InfoWars.
[02:56:07.944 --> 02:56:12.529]  ...has stood in defiance of George Soros, the globalist Hillary, and all these scumbags.
[02:56:12.829 --> 02:56:13.730]  So great job!
[02:56:14.010 --> 02:56:15.411]  You've built what we've done!
[02:56:15.431 --> 02:56:16.452]  I salute you!
[02:56:19.813 --> 02:56:20.773]  Living Defense.
[02:56:21.034 --> 02:56:22.234]  This is beyond a probiotic.
[02:56:22.274 --> 02:56:28.456]  It's got all these things known to flush out the bad little visitors in the guts and really get your guts up to optimum condition.
[02:56:28.496 --> 02:56:30.217]  And have you ever thought probiotics were amazing?
[02:56:30.237 --> 02:56:30.617]  Which they aren't.
[02:56:30.957 --> 02:56:33.118]  This is next level and does it a different way.
[02:56:33.318 --> 02:56:34.839]  It targets and gets rid of bad guys.
[02:56:34.919 --> 02:56:36.179]  It doesn't promote the good guys.
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:38.941]  Because when you get rid of the bad guys, the good guys can operate.
[02:56:38.981 --> 02:56:40.201]  The New World Order is targeting your gut.
[02:56:40.281 --> 02:56:42.262]  Living Defense is the best, most powerful formula.
[02:56:42.402 --> 02:56:43.442]  And it is a big bottle.
[02:56:43.602 --> 02:56:44.523]  Let me show TV viewers this.
[02:56:45.123 --> 02:56:45.704]  It's a brand new bottle.
[02:56:45.724 --> 02:56:47.265]  I was remembering, I haven't taken this in about six months.
[02:56:47.285 --> 02:56:48.306]  I take it about twice a year.
[02:56:48.586 --> 02:56:48.947]  Look at this.
[02:56:49.107 --> 02:56:49.647]  Look at that.
[02:56:49.727 --> 02:56:50.088]  Look at this.
[02:56:50.168 --> 02:56:51.489]  Damn, it's going all over the floor everywhere.
[02:56:51.509 --> 02:56:52.250]  There's so many of them.
[02:56:52.410 --> 02:56:52.870]  Hold on.
[02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:53.331]  There you go.
[02:56:53.471 --> 02:56:54.492]  I mean, once it fell on the floor.
[02:56:54.572 --> 02:56:55.593]  These babies are amazing.
[02:56:55.613 --> 02:57:00.597]  You take a few of these a day for a month, you're going to have some results that are, let's just say, magnificent.
[02:57:00.777 --> 02:57:02.879]  And this is Mother Nature gave us.
[02:57:02.979 --> 02:57:04.000]  God gave us Mother Nature.
[02:57:04.140 --> 02:57:06.182]  It is LivingDefenseInfoWarStore.com.
[02:57:06.302 --> 02:57:07.363]  And you fund the Info War.
[02:57:07.403 --> 02:57:09.465]  So it's a total win-win, win-win-win.
[02:57:09.645 --> 02:57:10.726]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:57:23.507 --> 02:57:25.749]  Please remember that it's down to the wire.
[02:57:27.071 --> 02:57:32.757]  When I say please tell people about Band.Video or NewsWorx.com or InfoWorx.com, people are ready to hear the truth.
[02:57:33.157 --> 02:57:34.719]  Everything is basically censored now.
[02:57:35.860 --> 02:57:37.642]  We built our own system to be able to do this.
[02:57:37.742 --> 02:57:39.064]  We're on over 200 radio stations.
[02:57:39.084 --> 02:57:41.046]  We're on over 100 TV stations and cable stations.
[02:57:41.106 --> 02:57:42.447]  And we've got Band.Video.
[02:57:42.508 --> 02:57:44.009]  Get the videos from Band.Video.
[02:57:44.049 --> 02:57:44.670]  Get the articles.
[02:57:44.850 --> 02:57:48.933]  So many videos, so many films, so many reports can only be found at Bandot Video.
[02:57:49.073 --> 02:57:55.597]  All these top medical doctors can't even come out and say what happened with their patients or their band, and now they're getting in trouble, and now they're losing their licenses.
[02:57:55.697 --> 02:57:56.818]  I mean, this is terror!
[02:57:57.058 --> 02:58:01.341]  And we're under massive attack, massive infiltration, massive globalist operations.
[02:58:01.741 --> 02:58:04.862]  I can't even get to it on air, but your prayers are keeping us in the fight.
[02:58:05.162 --> 02:58:08.623]  So just thank you so much, and please don't forget, the Storable Food Company we have is the best.
[02:58:08.723 --> 02:58:10.124]  It ships in one to two weeks now.
[02:58:10.304 --> 02:58:13.005]  Highest quality, special needs diets, all of it.
[02:58:13.125 --> 02:58:19.006]  Get your orders for Storable Foods in at infomorestore.com today to make sure you get quality at a great price, and it gets delivered quickly.
[02:58:19.246 --> 02:58:27.169]  Take this lull where they've gotten caught up on food shipments to get your orders in before what's coming, because even if Trump wins, even if we stabilize stuff, they're going to start a civil war after that.
[02:58:27.449 --> 02:58:29.771]  The Betsy Ross flag combined with the Don't Tread On Me Gadsden flag are two
[02:58:53.985 --> 02:59:00.908]  Founding images of our Republic are two iconic images that let us remember what makes our country so great.
[02:59:01.328 --> 02:59:07.030]  Rugged individualism, the revolutionary spirit to launch the greatest, freest nation in the world's history.
[02:59:07.770 --> 02:59:11.632]  An American system that threatens the global corporate anti-human system.
[02:59:12.172 --> 02:59:14.613]  A system they must discredit and destroy.
[02:59:15.034 --> 02:59:19.317]  If they believe they're going to extinguish the light of liberty in the hearts and minds of humans across this planet.
[02:59:19.538 --> 02:59:24.422]  You can find this powerful t-shirt and many others at InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:59:24.642 --> 02:59:28.305]  And on the back, it's got the iconic America's Back InfoWars.com.
[02:59:29.305 --> 02:59:35.090]  Get your Betsy Ross Gaston Flack t-shirt in navy blue at InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:59:35.470 --> 02:59:39.434]  And your purchase funds the InfoWars and spreads the word in the third dimension.
[02:59:39.654 --> 02:59:41.015]  Take action now, Paul Reveres.
[02:59:41.235 --> 02:59:43.497]  Get this shirt and others at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:48.868 --> 02:59:52.250]  This is going to come down to sight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:59:52.270 --> 02:59:53.410]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:59:53.430 --> 02:59:54.851]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:59:55.151 --> 02:59:56.532]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:59:56.652 --> 02:59:57.673]  I want them shut down.
[02:59:57.733 --> 02:59:58.653]  I want them silenced.
[02:59:58.693 --> 02:59:59.494]  I want them muted.
[02:59:59.554 --> 03:00:01.315]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:00:01.335 --> 03:00:02.275]  You kept us on air.
[03:00:02.415 --> 03:00:03.736]  We did the analysis first.
[03:00:03.956 --> 03:00:04.997]  It's now gone mainstream.
[03:00:05.037 --> 03:00:06.837]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[03:00:07.118 --> 03:00:13.001]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[03:00:13.581 --> 03:00:14.662]  You need to stop right now.
[03:00:14.762 --> 03:00:15.823]  And they're very, very serious.
[03:00:15.964 --> 03:00:18.346]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[03:00:18.366 --> 03:00:19.527]  This is not going to happen.
[03:00:19.547 --> 03:00:21.229]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[03:00:21.670 --> 03:00:24.112]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[03:00:24.192 --> 03:00:25.854]  Save yourself, save the world.
[03:00:26.154 --> 03:00:27.035]  We're in this together.
[03:00:27.215 --> 03:00:28.116]  Because let me tell you something.
[03:00:28.777 --> 03:00:29.758]  Communism's up here.
[03:00:29.958 --> 03:00:32.900]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[03:00:33.320 --> 03:00:35.121]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[03:00:35.342 --> 03:00:36.883]  My children are right here!
[03:00:37.623 --> 03:00:39.344]  But I need money to fight a war!
[03:00:39.564 --> 03:00:40.605]  And I need word of mouth!
[03:00:40.825 --> 03:00:41.726]  And I need prayer!
[03:00:41.866 --> 03:00:42.827]  And I need action!
[03:00:43.187 --> 03:00:44.788]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[03:00:45.508 --> 03:00:47.470]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
