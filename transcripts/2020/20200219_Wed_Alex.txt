[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:05.433]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:17.801]  A lot of what I do here is state the obvious.
[00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:20.223]  That there are only two genders.
[00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:28.489]  That communism is an absolute disaster except for the demons that run it.
[00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.078]  That Hillary Clinton is a lying criminal.
[00:00:34.098 --> 00:00:38.239]  It's Wednesday, February 19th, 2020.
[00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.340]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.921]  And we are seeing a phenomenon all over the United States of Democrat Party candidates being confronted with the facts.
[00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:58.743]  And as I said a few months ago, back when Owen Schroyer simply stood up and confronted Jerry Nadler with the facts that they were the ones involved in treason.
[00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:22.951]  And that they were the ones that were butchering this country, and that if other people went out and did similar things, we could shut down the Democrats with the facts and the reality, and take over all of their events, and really put on display what criminals they are, and they'll fold like a tower of cards in a high wind.
[00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:26.726]  Well, it's happened again.
[00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:29.828]  Bloomberg confronted for being in Epstein's little black book.
[00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:32.449]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.471]  This is the answer to taking these criminals on.
[00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:44.034]  Democrat presidential candidate and former New York mayor was confronted by Dan Bodondi, host of Truth Radio Show.
[00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:46.575]  Listeners of this broadcast know Dan well.
[00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:47.015]  Here it is.
[00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:52.960]  It's easy for me to make that commitment, because I can't spell.
[00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:56.163]  On the other hand, neither can Donald.
[00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:00.406]  Seriously, this is a campaign for change.
[00:02:00.807 --> 00:02:04.230]  For sanity, for honesty, for inclusion, for compassion.
[00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.674]  Hey Michael, how come your name was in Epstein's black book?
[00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:10.635]  How come your name was in Epstein's black book?
[00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:11.496]  Just answer the question.
[00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:14.078]  Why was your name in Epstein's black book?
[00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:23.295]  You know what, you're a communist scum.
[00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:25.635]  You're not taking our guns, none of you.
[00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:29.476]  1776 will begin again if you take our guns.
[00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:38.118]  Shut the fuck up.
[00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.098]  You're a disgrace to the Constitution, you global scum!
[00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:51.037]  You're a globalist scum!
[00:02:51.597 --> 00:02:53.839]  When are the people going to stand up against you, Jesus?
[00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.481]  Thank you, I appreciate your thoughts.
[00:02:56.621 --> 00:03:00.824]  We are not going to allow you to take our Second Amendment.
[00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:01.164]  Trump 2020!
[00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:02.665]  Trump 2020!
[00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:09.090]  You're not taking our guns, you globalist scum!
[00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.112]  1776 will begin again!
[00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.411]  That's a communist!
[00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.032]  Disorder in public!
[00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:22.913]  Let's go back to Mar-a-Lago
[00:03:48.553 --> 00:03:51.395]  Michael Bloomberg, you're a criminal to the Constitution!
[00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:52.516]  Oh, look at this guy!
[00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:54.678]  He puts on some dirty Jordans and he thinks he's cool!
[00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:57.580]  Your boss is hanging around with the known child rapist!
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.000]  Yeah, you!
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.621]  Turn around!
[00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:02.524]  You think you can try to put on Jordans if you're down with the culture and you don't match?
[00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:04.926]  You're a sellout pedophile protector!
[00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:05.966]  How dare you!
[00:04:06.187 --> 00:04:08.308]  The Second Amendment will not be your friend!
[00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:11.271]  You don't have enough forces to disarm the American people!
[00:04:12.812 --> 00:04:15.494]  1776 will begin again if you try to disarm us!
[00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:21.758]  Michael Bloomberg flew around the world with known child rapist Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:27.762]  He's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a known white nationalist Anglo-American establishment.
[00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:30.524]  He wants to take our human freedoms and rights away.
[00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:36.688]  He said he wants to change the Constitution that men and women have been their blood, sweat, and tears for.
[00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:39.610]  You are a traitor to this country, Michael Bloomberg!
[00:04:43.237 --> 00:04:49.741]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's activism like this that will bring the tyrants to their knees.
[00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:50.341]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:50.782]  Stay with us.
[00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:57.686]  Ladies and gentlemen, very exciting things are happening across the United States and the world.
[00:04:57.806 --> 00:05:05.351]  Populists are waking up and are taking action and are speaking out and are confronting
[00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:09.212]  These corrupt politicians to their faces.
[00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:15.914]  Now, there's a video that's posted right now to Infowars.com for Nationalfile.com.
[00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:21.436]  Bloomberg confronted for being an Epstein's little black book.
[00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:30.640]  Now, let's talk about the fact that Hillary Rodham Clinton was running Jeffrey Epstein
[00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:41.088]  And was extremely close to Bloomberg, and you've obviously seen how they're now talking about running together with Hillary as the VP.
[00:05:41.148 --> 00:05:47.313]  That's why Hillary and Bill are so powerful, is they were in control of those pedophilia blackmail rings.
[00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:49.094]  And that's now, of course, mainstream news.
[00:05:49.354 --> 00:05:51.096]  We've been exposing it for more than two decades.
[00:05:52.188 --> 00:06:01.079]  And so whether Hillary goes to New York or whether she goes to LA or whether she goes to Austin, Texas, she is confronted with the Epstein information.
[00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:05.950]  Many times there are people outside protesting, there are people inside protesting.
[00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.971]  Bill Clinton, everywhere he goes, is confronted with, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:19.515]  They were trying to project that onto Trump four years ago, but they failed because InfoWars listeners went and screamed, Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:06:19.535 --> 00:06:20.536]  He settled three rapes.
[00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:22.657]  Hillary helped cover it up.
[00:06:23.996 --> 00:06:28.599]  And that's why, of course, we've been targeted by Hillary was for taking her on at point-blank range.
[00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:34.543]  I personally am very blessed to even be alive, but I just put it in God's hands and thanks to your prayers, we are still here.
[00:06:34.643 --> 00:06:46.411]  We put together some powerful compilations of that and of Owen confronting Nadler in Congress and all these Democrats being confronted around the country with their backgrounds, with their corruption.
[00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:50.114]  We don't go try to shut them down like Democrats do and stop their events.
[00:06:50.834 --> 00:07:06.115]  We go and eloquently lay out the facts, and it totally takes over their events in a good way, and we're all over the news, all over TV, and all over print, and there's no way they can shut it down, and the minions of Hillary
[00:07:07.717 --> 00:07:13.859]  And the minions of Bill and the minions of Bloomberg don't know what to do.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:20.081]  They don't know how to respond to the facts, because it's not just, you're a racist, F you!
[00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:22.702]  You need to be put in prison!
[00:07:22.722 --> 00:07:23.763]  Stuff like that.
[00:07:24.423 --> 00:07:32.689]  Like the left does, trying to physically shut down the events, we shut down their propaganda with truth, and they're speechless and don't know what to say.
[00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:37.512]  So we're not censoring them, we're going and having our voices heard.
[00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:45.117]  Just like Owen did, saying you're treasonous, you're the traitor, not Trump, because Nadler was saying that the president was a traitor.
[00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:49.701]  The globalists want America to be dead and shoveled into its grave.
[00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:57.635]  They want America to be the past and not to be reborn as any nation must be to survive more than 200 years.
[00:07:57.675 --> 00:08:00.300]  But we're here thanks to you ensuring that happens.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.961]  So I'm going to play...
[00:08:01.957 --> 00:08:09.324]  Bill Clinton being confronted as a rapist, just a few of the hundreds of times, sponsored by InfoWars, brought to you by our listeners, Taking Action.
[00:08:09.844 --> 00:08:13.248]  And then we're going to show Hillary, three or four months ago, being confronted in Austin.
[00:08:13.268 --> 00:08:20.575]  And then we're going to show Bloomberg being confronted a few days ago, now breaking at InfoWars.com on the Epstein connection.
[00:08:21.075 --> 00:08:32.361]  And then we're going to show Owen Schroyer, and of course you know what he did, because this is the answer, and this is how we take them on, and this is how we stop the censorship, is by activism in the third dimension.
[00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:35.102]  Here is Bill Clinton being shut down four years ago.
[00:08:42.762 --> 00:08:44.203]  Adoptable dogs.
[00:08:44.303 --> 00:08:50.866]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters find help.
[00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:52.487]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:08:52.527 --> 00:08:55.508]  We've got a rapist.
[00:08:55.708 --> 00:09:01.331]  I think one of the kind of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:02.432]  Infowars.com.
[00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:03.332]  Infowars.com.
[00:09:03.632 --> 00:09:04.533]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:05.893]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:09:06.114 --> 00:09:06.354]  Alright.
[00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:06.774]  Bill Clinton.
[00:09:07.174 --> 00:09:14.899]  And I got this Hillary for Prison t-shirt, and I just want everyone to know about this big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.601]  Okay, thank you very much, Terrence.
[00:09:17.621 --> 00:09:20.803]  I want to make sure everybody gets a chance to participate.
[00:09:21.163 --> 00:09:27.908]  How can we help families succeed in the most important job in society, raising children, and succeeding at work?
[00:09:29.515 --> 00:09:32.676]  You're out of here.
[00:09:32.696 --> 00:09:34.556]  What about Juanita Broderick?
[00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.357]  Did you write about her in your book?
[00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:37.437]  You've said your piece.
[00:09:38.717 --> 00:09:42.658]  Did you write about Paula Jones in your book?
[00:09:42.698 --> 00:09:44.238]  You've said your piece.
[00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:50.380]  Alex Jones has read about this woman!
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.661]  Juanita Broderick!
[00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:56.101]  Is she in the book?
[00:09:57.145 --> 00:09:58.466]  Is Juanita Broderick in her book?
[00:09:58.606 --> 00:10:00.847]  Is Paula Jones in her book?
[00:10:01.887 --> 00:10:03.708]  Paula Jones, look her up!
[00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:11.531]  It's easy for me to make that commitment because I can't spell.
[00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:12.631]  And neither can Donald.
[00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.924]  Seriously, this is a campaign for change.
[00:10:19.324 --> 00:10:25.108]  For sanity, for honesty, for inclusion, for compassion.
[00:10:25.528 --> 00:10:29.170]  Hey Michael, how come your name wasn't in Epstein's black book?
[00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:38.056]  How come your name wasn't in Epstein's black book?
[00:10:38.116 --> 00:10:39.857]  Just answer the question.
[00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:41.838]  Why was your name in Epstein's black book?
[00:10:41.858 --> 00:10:44.079]  Why was your name in Epstein's black book?
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.861]  I will talk to you outside, okay?
[00:10:52.035 --> 00:10:56.638]  You are saying you're a sellout!
[00:10:56.678 --> 00:10:57.139]  You are a sellout!
[00:10:57.179 --> 00:10:58.280]  You know what, you're a communist scum.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.961]  You're not taking our guns, none of you.
[00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:01.542]  1776 will begin again if you take our guns.
[00:11:01.582 --> 00:11:02.163]  Shut the fuck up.
[00:11:02.183 --> 00:11:03.984]  Thank you for making me feel like I'm a fascist.
[00:11:04.004 --> 00:11:06.306]  You're a disgrace to the Constitution, you global scum!
[00:11:08.248 --> 00:11:09.549]  You're a global scum!
[00:11:10.229 --> 00:11:12.071]  And when are the people going to stand up against you?
[00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:14.993]  Thank you, I appreciate your thoughts.
[00:11:17.304 --> 00:11:20.846]  We are not going to allow you to take our Second Amendment.
[00:11:20.866 --> 00:11:21.186]  Trump 2020!
[00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:21.566]  Trump 2020!
[00:11:21.606 --> 00:11:27.629]  You're not taking our guns, you globalist scum!
[00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:30.790]  Here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing.
[00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.232]  I will make an opening statement, and then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement.
[00:11:37.013 --> 00:11:39.454]  After that, we will hear two sets of presentations.
[00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:46.537]  We will hear 30-minute opening arguments from councils for the majority and the minority of this committee.
[00:11:54.818 --> 00:11:58.902]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country!
[00:11:59.203 --> 00:12:02.206]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes!
[00:12:02.246 --> 00:12:03.467]  You are, Jerry Nadler!
[00:12:03.808 --> 00:12:05.189]  You're the one committing treason!
[00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.372]  America's done with this!
[00:12:07.392 --> 00:12:10.135]  America's sick of the treason committed by the Democrat Party!
[00:12:10.894 --> 00:12:14.917]  They're not going to sit here and watch me run an impeachment campaign and remove our vote!
[00:12:15.337 --> 00:12:20.741]  We voted for Donald Trump, and they're simply removing it because they don't like it!
[00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:25.464]  Americans are sick of your impeachment, Shannon!
[00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:29.927]  They're sick of the Democrat treason!
[00:12:30.307 --> 00:12:32.708]  We know who committed the crimes, and it wasn't Trump!
[00:12:32.768 --> 00:12:33.629]  Trump is innocent!
[00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:34.930]  The committee will come to order.
[00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:49.987]  Obviously, I shouldn't have to remind everyone present that the audience is here to observe, but not to demonstrate, not to indicate agreement or disagreement with any witness or with any member of the committee.
[00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:52.989]  Yeah, I'm Owen Schroeder from InfoWars.com.
[00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:54.530]  InfoWars.com?
[00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:54.870]  Yeah.
[00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:55.390]  What's your name?
[00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:56.651]  Owen Schroeder.
[00:12:56.751 --> 00:13:00.474]  I think it's ironic I'm being hauled out of here when the Democrats are the ones committing crimes.
[00:13:05.442 --> 00:13:08.144]  I'm being arrested right now for disruption of Congress.
[00:13:08.164 --> 00:13:10.526]  I'm a criminal for my first amendment rights.
[00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:18.493]  See you right here, folks.
[00:13:18.553 --> 00:13:20.414]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what it's all about.
[00:13:20.515 --> 00:13:23.457]  You want to take your country back, 1776, part two.
[00:13:24.318 --> 00:13:26.620]  You do it in an information war.
[00:13:27.901 --> 00:13:28.581]  It's that simple.
[00:13:29.082 --> 00:13:30.923]  And it's all you've got to go out and do.
[00:13:30.983 --> 00:13:32.725]  You don't have to go charge machine gun nest.
[00:13:33.717 --> 00:13:35.478]  Like veterans have done to defend the country.
[00:13:35.518 --> 00:13:37.400]  This is the nation under globalist attack.
[00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:43.465]  And they're openly involved in pedophile rings and blackmail and they're openly involved in incredible corruption.
[00:13:44.345 --> 00:13:48.929]  And we've got people like Bloomberg with all of his corruption.
[00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:50.250]  He supports death panels.
[00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:55.073]  He tells his employees to get abortions on record so he makes more money.
[00:13:55.094 --> 00:13:55.134]  He
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.901]  Is involved, you know, saying that farmers are stupid and suck.
[00:14:03.462 --> 00:14:04.522]  These are monsters.
[00:14:05.462 --> 00:14:08.364]  And all their money can't change the fact that they're monsters.
[00:14:09.564 --> 00:14:14.586]  So when we come back, we're going to talk about how we take it to the enemy.
[00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:17.508]  And how we make sure it's their system that is the past.
[00:14:18.008 --> 00:14:21.289]  Their system that's shoveled into its grave politically, and not our republic.
[00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.431]  We've got to find our heart, our soul, our mind, our memories again.
[00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:27.612]  And rediscover who we are.
[00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:29.433]  Not goldfish, but humans.
[00:14:32.202 --> 00:14:32.923]  To be a farmer.
[00:14:33.203 --> 00:14:33.983]  It's a process.
[00:14:34.003 --> 00:14:37.746]  You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn.
[00:14:37.826 --> 00:14:38.406]  You could learn that.
[00:14:51.775 --> 00:14:54.096]  Take you now to Chicago and Paul Harvey.
[00:14:54.557 --> 00:15:00.701]  And on the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, I need a caretaker.
[00:15:02.148 --> 00:15:03.109]  So God made a farmer.
[00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:13.400]  God said, I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, milk cows, work all day in the fields, milk cows again, eat supper, then go to town and stay past midnight at a meeting of the school board.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.381]  So God made a farmer.
[00:15:16.023 --> 00:15:23.932]  God said, I need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt and watch it die, then dry his eyes and say, maybe next year.
[00:15:25.442 --> 00:15:41.324]  I need somebody who can shave an axe handle from a persimmon sprout, shoe a horse with a hunk of car tire, who can make harness out of hay, wire, feed sacks, and shoe scraps, who planting time and harvest season will finish his 40-hour week by Tuesday noon and then paint him from tractor back, put in another 72 hours.
[00:15:41.384 --> 00:15:42.246]  So God made a farmer.
[00:15:43.647 --> 00:15:55.384]  God said I need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bales, yet gentle enough to yield lambs and wean pigs and tend to pink-combed bullets who will stop his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a meadowlark.
[00:15:55.664 --> 00:15:56.626]  So God made a farmer.
[00:15:58.141 --> 00:16:01.584]  It had to be somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not cut corners.
[00:16:01.624 --> 00:16:07.288]  Somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, and break, and disc, and plow, and plant, and tie the fleece, and strain the milk.
[00:16:07.608 --> 00:16:10.930]  Somebody who'd bail a family together with a soft, strong bonds of sharing.
[00:16:11.551 --> 00:16:22.759]  Who would laugh, and then sigh, and then reply with smiling eyes when his son says that he wants to spend his life doing what dad does.
[00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:24.580]  So God made a farmer.
[00:16:34.742 --> 00:16:41.726]  The world is awake!
[00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:50.329]  We're good to go.
[00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:21.232]  The 1984 is 1771!
[00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:29.647]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of the American people!
[00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:31.871]  Hillary Clinton!
[00:17:39.008 --> 00:17:43.214]  We're openly calling for censorship of all patriots and nationalists!
[00:17:43.294 --> 00:17:50.204]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who failed to sell our nation out to the Chicago!
[00:17:50.304 --> 00:17:52.608]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal!
[00:17:54.227 --> 00:17:58.169]  Hillary Clinton will never silence the American people!
[00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.811]  America is awake!
[00:18:01.512 --> 00:18:03.513]  America knows what's happening!
[00:18:04.073 --> 00:18:06.755]  And Infowars.com is exposing it!
[00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:08.856]  America is back!
[00:18:09.096 --> 00:18:10.517]  America is back!
[00:18:10.597 --> 00:18:11.638]  America is back!
[00:18:12.018 --> 00:18:13.639]  America is back!
[00:18:26.057 --> 00:18:47.675]  Hillary Clinton is a war criminal and is involved in child sex trafficking on a daily.
[00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:54.113]  Hillary Clinton is involved with Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:58.556]  Hillary Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile aircraft.
[00:18:58.656 --> 00:19:07.142]  Democrats are authoritarian, anti-American criminals that have failed to silence our speech.
[00:19:07.342 --> 00:19:12.145]  Big Tech and the CHICOMS and Hillary have failed to silence America's speech.
[00:19:12.165 --> 00:19:13.186]  America is back.
[00:19:13.266 --> 00:19:14.127]  America is back.
[00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:21.451]  America is back!
[00:19:21.552 --> 00:19:22.092]  America is back!
[00:19:22.152 --> 00:19:23.393]  America is back!
[00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:27.815]  Hillary Clinton worked with the child molester Jeffrey Epstein!
[00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.377]  Hillary Clinton wants to sexualize our children!
[00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:43.837]  Hillary Clinton, who can't even walk, are going down.
[00:19:44.077 --> 00:19:45.559]  Hillary Clinton is a failure.
[00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:48.343]  Your Democratic Party is collapsing.
[00:19:48.383 --> 00:19:50.746]  Every city you control is collapsing into hell.
[00:19:50.766 --> 00:19:56.553]  Everyone is running from the Democrats and their mental illness.
[00:19:57.214 --> 00:19:59.075]  The Democrats are KKK!
[00:19:59.535 --> 00:20:01.256]  The Democrats are KKK!
[00:20:01.296 --> 00:20:03.057]  The Democrats are KKK!
[00:20:25.528 --> 00:20:31.956]  We're good to go.
[00:20:54.312 --> 00:20:55.614]  Here's the problem!
[00:20:55.674 --> 00:20:57.057]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[00:20:57.678 --> 00:20:58.559]  Inbowars.com!
[00:21:02.446 --> 00:21:03.967]  Adoptable dogs.
[00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:10.613]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters find homes.
[00:21:11.013 --> 00:21:12.234]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:21:12.274 --> 00:21:14.156]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:21:14.216 --> 00:21:15.217]  We've got a rapist.
[00:21:15.477 --> 00:21:21.101]  I think one of the kind of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:21:21.241 --> 00:21:22.182]  Infowars.com.
[00:21:22.302 --> 00:21:23.103]  Infowars.com.
[00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:24.284]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:21:24.604 --> 00:21:25.645]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:21:25.865 --> 00:21:26.105]  Alright.
[00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:26.566]  Bill Clinton.
[00:21:26.926 --> 00:21:34.648]  And I got this Hillary for Prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this like big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[00:21:35.528 --> 00:21:37.429]  Okay, thank you very much Terrence.
[00:21:37.969 --> 00:21:40.590]  How can we make sure everybody gets a chance to participate?
[00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:47.652]  How can we help families succeed in the most important job in society, raising children and succeeding at work?
[00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:52.411]  He doesn't age.
[00:21:52.551 --> 00:21:53.211]  No, he doesn't.
[00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:53.672]  He looks great.
[00:21:54.112 --> 00:21:54.973]  We're all going to rickroll.
[00:21:55.653 --> 00:21:56.414]  Exactly.
[00:21:56.574 --> 00:21:58.256]  A lot to get to.
[00:21:59.156 --> 00:21:59.757]  All right, folks.
[00:22:00.437 --> 00:22:04.701]  Again, I saw this morning the video up on Infowars.com.
[00:22:05.201 --> 00:22:10.525]  Bloomberg confronted for being in Epstein's little black book, and he's all part of that whole network with the Clintons.
[00:22:12.467 --> 00:22:18.332]  And I just, again, knew that if we take action and we go to their events, we confront them with the facts.
[00:22:19.565 --> 00:22:20.645]  That it's over for the Deep State.
[00:22:21.486 --> 00:22:23.267]  They all are a pack of sick filth.
[00:22:24.707 --> 00:22:38.293]  And just the understanding of that right before the show began made me explode with victory and energy to the point of I was like a race car engine revving to 10,000 RPMs, 11,000 RPMs and blowing a rod.
[00:22:39.573 --> 00:22:40.874]  Because I'm not a psychopath.
[00:22:41.014 --> 00:22:41.474]  I care.
[00:22:41.614 --> 00:22:42.515]  I'm not a sociopath.
[00:22:42.615 --> 00:22:43.375]  I'm the opposite.
[00:22:45.495 --> 00:22:50.779]  You know, I work out to the soundtrack of the good, the bad and the ugly.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.046]  And I probably shouldn't do it because it gets me very focused and very emotional when that blood's pouring into my brain.
[00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:01.568]  And I know how to defeat the globalist.
[00:23:02.468 --> 00:23:07.993]  Because any time I've been able to carry out anything that we've got planned, it actually happens.
[00:23:08.333 --> 00:23:09.934]  The problem is you got to punch through.
[00:23:09.954 --> 00:23:13.137]  And there's nothing.
[00:23:14.656 --> 00:23:27.800]  In the universe, more frustrating than knowing you've got the birthright, you've got the answers, you've got the will, you've got the force, and the ability to win and defeat these evil people, and to not be able to carry it out.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:36.942]  There's nothing like having success, incredible success, but then knowing that you fall short 95% of the time.
[00:23:40.962 --> 00:23:42.723]  Everything we do has had a huge effect.
[00:23:43.163 --> 00:23:46.464]  The enemy knows that InfoWars is marked for victory.
[00:23:47.204 --> 00:23:49.785]  They know our destiny is destroying them.
[00:23:55.588 --> 00:23:59.589]  My problem, and I was already going to come on air and talk about this today.
[00:24:04.451 --> 00:24:07.092]  And then, five minutes before I went on air,
[00:24:09.048 --> 00:24:24.942]  I just exploded mentally with thousands of data points and how to defeat the globalists and like a huge battle plan and then you're supposed to go on air with that and then the first little mistake that happens getting ready for the show I just run off the rails and the race car explodes.
[00:24:27.544 --> 00:24:37.012]  Now juxtapose that with people walking around like zombies that don't even care about being conscious or on this planet or aren't even curious about where we come from.
[00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:47.816]  There's those people that are in a trance, there's those of us that are awake, and then there's those that are awake but decided to join evil.
[00:24:51.838 --> 00:24:52.799]  And I'm not a victim.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.100]  I'm not complaining.
[00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:59.143]  But I just am gonna be honest with the audience, because I know what you're going through as well.
[00:25:02.225 --> 00:25:05.447]  I don't want to read about all the evil they're involved in.
[00:25:06.724 --> 00:25:15.830]  I mean, 20 years ago I'd find some corruption point, I'd go, oh look at this, or I'd find the UN admitting they wanted to take guns, and I'd go, oh look, they really want the guns, they say they don't, but here's their own document.
[00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:22.174]  Now it's just out in the open, hey, we're gonna come get your kids in preschool and have sex with them.
[00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.115]  I mean, that's in the news today.
[00:25:32.801 --> 00:25:34.942]  And so, there's a balance point
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:44.103]  Somewhere there I've got to find, because I know listeners of this broadcast are not sociopaths.
[00:25:45.363 --> 00:25:53.547]  People that don't have feelings, they're just like reptoid machines that only care about their own financial power.
[00:25:56.849 --> 00:26:04.032]  And then psychopaths, which run a whole gambit of different types of people, but that enjoy hurting people and don't have feelings on top of it.
[00:26:06.246 --> 00:26:10.710]  And it's not that I admire those people, I actually hate their guts and I'm always fighting with them.
[00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.394]  It's that I wish I had a little bit of that.
[00:26:18.956 --> 00:26:23.540]  You know, used to I'd make jokes about evil stuff going on and be sarcastic and sardonic.
[00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:29.185]  As a coping strategy, I would just halfway get into the mental role
[00:26:30.953 --> 00:26:33.974]  I had Dr. Sherry Tenpenny who's been on my broadcast now for over 22 years.
[00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:03.635]  Renowned medical doctor, whole nine yards, sees the kids brain damaged, goes public, gets attacked, totally vindicated.
[00:27:03.735 --> 00:27:06.477]  Ewan admits that they're covering up vaccine damages.
[00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:14.644]  And she said, it's a planetary plan to depopulate us and they're targeting our children to destroy the future.
[00:27:15.704 --> 00:27:17.666]  And she says, that's why we've got to annihilate them.
[00:27:19.247 --> 00:27:21.709]  Now that's not the woman I knew 22 years ago.
[00:27:21.809 --> 00:27:23.231]  She was strong and smart then.
[00:27:24.652 --> 00:27:27.094]  But now she's, we must annihilate them.
[00:27:27.978 --> 00:27:28.759]  Because that's true!
[00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:33.563]  These people have crawled up out from the pit of hell!
[00:27:35.304 --> 00:27:38.887]  And that's all I'm saying is there's no half measures.
[00:27:38.927 --> 00:27:46.074]  You go to a leftist event and they act like satanic ghouls because they are satanic ghouls.
[00:27:48.776 --> 00:27:53.220]  And Nietzsche said, don't look too long into the abyss lest you become the abyss.
[00:27:54.141 --> 00:27:55.462]  I'm not becoming the abyss.
[00:28:00.077 --> 00:28:01.239]  But I am in the abyss.
[00:28:03.441 --> 00:28:08.688]  And I get why people just punch out and go to sleep and are distracted because they're not openly evil.
[00:28:08.728 --> 00:28:12.413]  They don't want to be evil, but they're like, whoa, I can't handle this.
[00:28:13.462 --> 00:28:30.017]  You see, it's so over-the-top five years ago to hand out condoms to seven, eight-year-olds and up at Boy Scout events and tell them to go have sex with adults that everybody just went, whoa, and couldn't even talk about it because it was so insane.
[00:28:32.339 --> 00:28:40.186]  And see, that's evil's trick, is it does things so exponentially insane and so ridiculously evil that
[00:28:41.633 --> 00:28:47.408]  Like an amoeba, you can have an amoeba in a dish of water and put a heat source in it, and that amoeba will run.
[00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:50.035]  It's a single cell organism, but it will run from the heat.
[00:28:51.718 --> 00:28:52.939]  And that's why evil does that.
[00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:56.641]  That's why they vomit forth corruption and then have the news normalize it.
[00:28:56.921 --> 00:29:03.605]  So your very programming that God gave you goes, huh, and fries you to where you just kind of give up.
[00:29:03.765 --> 00:29:04.145]  I get it.
[00:29:04.325 --> 00:29:05.266]  See, I don't give up.
[00:29:05.726 --> 00:29:07.808]  I start fighting and fighting and fighting.
[00:29:08.028 --> 00:29:20.215]  But I've got to find that point where I realize it's in God's hands and in God's plan and just do the right thing and have a spirit of calm, like the Bible says, because if you don't, you will go insane.
[00:29:26.809 --> 00:29:29.490]  But I could look at Hillary Clinton five years ago.
[00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.970]  I can't even look at her now.
[00:29:32.051 --> 00:29:35.852]  She is a jack-o'-lantern headed pedophile demon.
[00:29:35.992 --> 00:29:44.795]  I mean, a literal interdimensional space alien jacked in, took her over, and that is a freaking devil, man.
[00:29:45.095 --> 00:29:48.557]  From deep space out of some black hole, here to feed on our children.
[00:29:48.637 --> 00:29:53.799]  And I'm not saying that as some literary flourish.
[00:29:53.979 --> 00:29:54.839]  She is that.
[00:29:56.243 --> 00:29:58.045]  And you're like, well, why is it so evil?
[00:29:58.125 --> 00:30:00.607]  Because that's the type of creature that would do this!
[00:30:00.807 --> 00:30:02.509]  You're like, why are they so evil?
[00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.692]  Because that exists in the universe.
[00:30:06.393 --> 00:30:07.774]  There's good and there's bad.
[00:30:08.034 --> 00:30:16.122]  And we have to admit there's good and bad and not be relativist or we can't defend ourselves against that thing come climbing up out of hell!
[00:30:19.866 --> 00:30:20.667]  On its elbows!
[00:30:22.659 --> 00:30:27.764]  Like Medusa to literally devour our children with that Bloomberg creature?
[00:30:31.627 --> 00:30:34.830]  All of you should thank God you're not Michael Bloomberg.
[00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:40.875]  I mean, the man is an absolute soulless husk.
[00:30:41.977 --> 00:30:43.637]  And that's why he acts like a space alien.
[00:30:43.817 --> 00:30:46.498]  He shakes dogs' faces, says, look, kill your baby!
[00:30:46.658 --> 00:30:47.678]  Let's kill old people!
[00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:48.779]  Farmers suck!
[00:30:48.819 --> 00:30:49.299]  Ha ha!
[00:30:49.559 --> 00:30:50.459]  Oh, they grow things!
[00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:51.820]  I have information!
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.040]  It takes a lot of power to have information!
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:54.980]  I'm Michael Bloomberg!
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:55.460]  Ha ha ha!
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:55.700]  That's it!
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.001]  Kill your baby!
[00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:56.101]  Kill!
[00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:56.441]  Kill the humans!
[00:30:56.461 --> 00:30:57.081]  Kill everybody!
[00:30:57.121 --> 00:30:57.241]  Kill!
[00:30:57.261 --> 00:30:57.361]  Kill!
[00:30:57.401 --> 00:30:57.481]  Kill!
[00:30:57.501 --> 00:30:57.581]  Kill!
[00:30:57.601 --> 00:30:57.681]  Kill!
[00:30:57.701 --> 00:30:57.781]  Kill!
[00:30:57.801 --> 00:30:57.881]  Kill!
[00:30:57.901 --> 00:30:57.981]  Kill!
[00:30:58.001 --> 00:30:58.081]  Kill!
[00:30:58.101 --> 00:30:58.181]  Kill!
[00:30:58.201 --> 00:30:58.281]  Kill!
[00:30:58.301 --> 00:30:58.381]  Kill!
[00:30:58.401 --> 00:30:58.481]  Kill!
[00:30:58.501 --> 00:30:58.621]  Kill!
[00:30:58.641 --> 00:30:58.761]  Kill!
[00:30:58.881 --> 00:30:58.961]  Kill!
[00:30:58.981 --> 00:30:59.081]  Kill!
[00:30:59.101 --> 00:30:59.181]  Kill!
[00:30:59.201 --> 00:30:59.281]  Kill!
[00:30:59.301 --> 00:30:59.381]  Kill!
[00:30:59.401 --> 00:30:59.481]  Kill!
[00:30:59.501 --> 00:30:59.581]  Kill!
[00:30:59.601 --> 00:30:59.742]  Kill!
[00:30:59.802 --> 00:30:59.882]  Kill!
[00:30:59.902 --> 00:31:00.042]  Kill!
[00:31:00.062 --> 00:31:00.142]  Kill!
[00:31:00.162 --> 00:31:00.242]  Kill!
[00:31:00.262 --> 00:31:00.342]  Kill!
[00:31:00.362 --> 00:31:00.462]  Kill!
[00:31:00.622 --> 00:31:00.702]  Kill!
[00:31:00.722 --> 00:31:00.802]  Kill!
[00:31:00.822 --> 00:31:00.902]  Kill!
[00:31:00.922 --> 00:31:01.002]  Kill!
[00:31:01.022 --> 00:31:01.102]  Kill!
[00:31:01.122 --> 00:31:01.202]  Kill!
[00:31:01.222 --> 00:31:01.302]  Kill!
[00:31:01.322 --> 00:31:01.462]  Kill!
[00:31:01.482 --> 00:31:01.562]  Kill!
[00:31:01.582 --> 00:31:01.662]  Kill!
[00:31:01.682 --> 00:31:01.762]  Kill!
[00:31:01.782 --> 00:31:01.862]  Kill!
[00:31:01.882 --> 00:31:02.022]  Kill!
[00:31:02.042 --> 00:31:02.122]  Kill!
[00:31:02.222 --> 00:31:02.342]  Kill!
[00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:02.462]  Kill!
[00:31:02.502 --> 00:31:02.602]  Kill!
[00:31:02.642 --> 00:31:02.722]  Kill!
[00:31:02.742 --> 00:31:02.822]  Kill!
[00:31:02.842 --> 00:31:02.922]  Kill!
[00:31:02.942 --> 00:31:03.022]  Kill!
[00:31:03.162 --> 00:31:03.262]  Kill!
[00:31:03.282 --> 00:31:03.382]  Kill!
[00:31:03.402 --> 00:31:03.482]  Kill!
[00:31:03.502 --> 00:31:03.602]  Kill!
[00:31:03.622 --> 00:31:03.703]  Kill!
[00:31:03.723 --> 00:31:03.803]  Kill!
[00:31:03.823 --> 00:31:03.903]  Kill!
[00:31:03.923 --> 00:31:04.003]  Kill!
[00:31:04.023 --> 00:31:04.103]  Kill!
[00:31:04.123 --> 00:31:04.203]  Kill!
[00:31:04.223 --> 00:31:04.303]  Kill!
[00:31:04.323 --> 00:31:04.403]  Kill!
[00:31:04.643 --> 00:31:04.763]  Kill!
[00:31:04.783 --> 00:31:04.923]  Kill!
[00:31:04.943 --> 00:31:05.043]  Kill!
[00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:05.163]  Kill!
[00:31:05.183 --> 00:31:05.363]  Kill!
[00:31:05.383 --> 00:31:05.623]  Kill
[00:31:06.735 --> 00:31:07.915]  You can see him spiritually.
[00:31:07.955 --> 00:31:15.897]  He's like a one foot tall goblin with pus running out his rear end, just dragging along, stinking to high heaven.
[00:31:17.118 --> 00:31:20.759]  And then he just sees humans made in the image of God, these towering mountains of light.
[00:31:21.899 --> 00:31:29.621]  But he's able to crawl into our ear or up our nose like a worm and just into our brain, just eat holes in it.
[00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:34.825]  And just look at him.
[00:31:35.225 --> 00:31:41.067]  Everything he does is some weird, twisted, pedophilic, homoerotic, you know, outfit.
[00:31:41.548 --> 00:31:44.188]  Hopping around with a devil tail.
[00:31:44.609 --> 00:31:45.929]  He's just showing you who he is.
[00:31:46.229 --> 00:31:47.189]  He's gone.
[00:31:47.209 --> 00:31:48.010]  He's gone.
[00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:53.572]  And he wants your guns, and he wants to shut off U.S.
[00:31:53.632 --> 00:31:54.372]  power plants.
[00:31:54.833 --> 00:32:00.395]  His mission as a soldier is to get your children, take your guns, and blow our generators!
[00:32:00.995 --> 00:32:01.635]  You can hear him.
[00:32:02.095 --> 00:32:03.856]  Sir, we've reached the shield generator.
[00:32:04.036 --> 00:32:05.116]  You may start your landing.
[00:32:05.376 --> 00:32:06.217]  Target U.S.
[00:32:06.277 --> 00:32:07.717]  energy and their children.
[00:32:07.977 --> 00:32:09.178]  Maximum firepower!
[00:32:10.778 --> 00:32:11.118]  Yeah.
[00:32:12.979 --> 00:32:18.261]  President Trump is going to win the 2020 election on our current trajectory.
[00:32:20.666 --> 00:32:23.167]  But President Trump's not doing everything we want.
[00:32:26.729 --> 00:32:31.991]  So, we're going to have to target Trump.
[00:32:37.313 --> 00:32:44.816]  But that's not a bad thing to do, and we're not doing it from an aggressive or mean-spirited place, like we did with Hillary Clinton.
[00:32:45.356 --> 00:32:47.077]  Just begging for her to kill me.
[00:32:48.334 --> 00:32:59.239]  Sending in hundreds of people paying up to $5,000 apiece to say Bill Clinton's a rapist and publicly doing it, and then paying out almost $400,000 in cash.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.502]  Because hey, people wanted to do it, but it's fun to get paid while you do it.
[00:33:06.183 --> 00:33:08.784]  A Bill Clinton's a rapist got you $1,000 if it was on local TV.
[00:33:11.918 --> 00:33:16.659]  2,000 for national TV and 5,000 if you said it to Bill Clinton's face!
[00:33:19.499 --> 00:33:27.201]  And they have done horrible things to me since then and I love it!
[00:33:27.241 --> 00:33:29.441]  Because I have been sent to destroy them.
[00:33:30.101 --> 00:33:30.681]  And they know it.
[00:33:32.382 --> 00:33:34.422]  You see, vengeance belongs to the Lord.
[00:33:35.362 --> 00:33:37.202]  But there are instruments of God.
[00:33:38.403 --> 00:33:40.243]  And I can feel God's rage.
[00:33:44.414 --> 00:33:53.759]  That's why I don't fear the enemy, the shrunken head of Hillary or Bill, that reanimated corpse.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.122]  I thank God every millisecond because I can feel the presence of God.
[00:34:00.343 --> 00:34:02.524]  And people say, how do you take on these people?
[00:34:02.544 --> 00:34:03.084]  They can kill you.
[00:34:03.104 --> 00:34:03.705]  They can destroy you.
[00:34:04.265 --> 00:34:05.045]  Well, they're trying.
[00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:08.347]  And quite frankly, I just want to be able to stay in the fight as long as I can.
[00:34:08.387 --> 00:34:09.288]  I don't care if they destroy me.
[00:34:10.535 --> 00:34:22.342]  I just get mad because I want to stab them and stab them and just politically just decapitate them with one... My full will against you!
[00:34:22.583 --> 00:34:26.385]  My hands around your spiritual neck crushing you with God empowering me!
[00:34:26.585 --> 00:34:27.386]  Unlimited!
[00:34:27.626 --> 00:34:28.126]  Unlimited!
[00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:29.107]  I'll crush you!
[00:34:29.587 --> 00:34:30.227]  Crush you!
[00:34:30.247 --> 00:34:31.508]  I will crush you!
[00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:34.370]  And you know it!
[00:34:35.231 --> 00:34:37.132]  And I'm not gonna sit here and hold back anymore!
[00:34:38.325 --> 00:34:41.667]  And we need people to stop fearing these devil worshippers.
[00:34:44.308 --> 00:34:45.268]  Now let's move on to Trump.
[00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:50.311]  Now time for Bible study.
[00:34:51.831 --> 00:35:01.095]  You see, victory's ours if we simply take it in our hands.
[00:35:02.416 --> 00:35:04.157]  The globalists spend all their time
[00:35:06.035 --> 00:35:25.104]  Demoralizing us and telling us it's all lost, and running around with our children at daycares and public schools where they've captured them, showing little girls riding on men's genitals in front of everyone as a symbol of, we've captured your flag, we've defeated you, it's all over, we have your children.
[00:35:25.364 --> 00:35:25.604]  No!
[00:35:25.904 --> 00:35:31.407]  You have a few pedophile parents that brought their children to pedophile events to flaunt it!
[00:35:32.409 --> 00:35:36.691]  Just because you've captured and hurt some children doesn't mean you've kicked anybody's ass!
[00:35:38.473 --> 00:35:50.519]  In fact, if we don't bow to this and become demoralized, if we take action and confront them and get in their face, it's over for the devil worshippers.
[00:35:52.461 --> 00:35:57.804]  I mean, I've got the articles right here that I haven't even gotten to.
[00:35:59.295 --> 00:36:02.296]  Where I mean just every day without me even looking they're here.
[00:36:03.157 --> 00:36:09.519]  With now elementary schools to teach four-year-olds that they need to have their genitals cut off.
[00:36:10.179 --> 00:36:15.762]  That's the type of stuff I have here on the stack that drives me insane before I go on air.
[00:36:17.262 --> 00:36:24.165]  And so instead of addressing each little piece of the nightmare that we know of, let's just go right to the heart of the matter.
[00:36:24.745 --> 00:36:26.386]  That these are spiritually dead people.
[00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:32.774]  And Misery Loves Company, and they want us to join them.
[00:36:34.376 --> 00:36:35.917]  Well, I'm not joining them.
[00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:38.239]  And it comes down to that.
[00:36:38.259 --> 00:36:42.162]  So let me do this.
[00:36:47.927 --> 00:36:53.392]  I kind of, I should have launched this over a month ago, and I got busy with all the news that you've seen, just like you've been busy.
[00:36:56.377 --> 00:36:57.678]  And I didn't cover it.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.542]  But it really is a major path to victory.
[00:37:03.282 --> 00:37:15.251]  Why are we going to just go out to Democrat events and take those over with the truth and politely and calmly expose the corruption of each candidate that is well known?
[00:37:16.992 --> 00:37:20.575]  Why just go to Bloomberg events and say, you're in Epstein's little black book.
[00:37:21.175 --> 00:37:21.816]  You're corrupt.
[00:37:24.116 --> 00:37:25.737]  You've said kill old ladies.
[00:37:25.757 --> 00:37:27.977]  You tell your employees abort their babies or you'll fire them.
[00:37:30.198 --> 00:37:30.738]  That's good.
[00:37:30.798 --> 00:37:31.398]  Let's do that.
[00:37:32.519 --> 00:37:43.382]  But let's let the neocons that still are in control of much of Trump's apparatus know that we the people aren't going to just sit here and put up with it.
[00:37:44.682 --> 00:37:48.343]  So I wrote this yesterday and it's being put up on the site now.
[00:37:48.403 --> 00:37:50.224]  The site's, I think, almost done.
[00:37:50.244 --> 00:37:53.605]  I was going to have it with Trump with a bunch of jets behind him.
[00:37:55.091 --> 00:38:00.355]  OperationWin2020.com, but I thought, you know, they're gonna change it to just a line of people at a Trump rally.
[00:38:01.256 --> 00:38:02.917]  That's what this is really all about, is we the people.
[00:38:04.358 --> 00:38:07.961]  Operation Win 2020, save the first amendment now.
[00:38:10.323 --> 00:38:12.204]  And so I wrote this, and it's up on the site.
[00:38:12.244 --> 00:38:13.785]  I shot a video this morning, it'll be up there.
[00:38:14.706 --> 00:38:17.368]  And the site should be live now, if not, it'll be launched in the next few hours.
[00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:19.129]  Let's just go check OperationWin2020.com.
[00:38:21.598 --> 00:38:30.125]  President Trump has done an incredible job taking on the deep state, exposing corruption and kick-starting not only the economy but the soul of America.
[00:38:30.785 --> 00:38:40.053]  But his greatest failing is doing almost nothing to defend free speech and expression as enshrined in the First Amendment, the most basic and cherished birthright of all Americans.
[00:38:41.114 --> 00:38:47.098]  The Justice Department announced in February that they will not be taking action against Big Tech for antitrust violations.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.360]  And open election meddling.
[00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:53.461]  We know President Trump listens to his constituents.
[00:38:54.202 --> 00:38:55.282]  We the people of America.
[00:38:56.022 --> 00:39:02.124]  I am not going to sit here and leave it to the bureaucrats and corporate cronies and lobbyists in DC to pressure Trump to do the right thing.
[00:39:02.604 --> 00:39:05.204]  Because we know it will never happen.
[00:39:06.085 --> 00:39:09.586]  They're doing the opposite, making sure President Trump is paralyzed.
[00:39:09.986 --> 00:39:14.127]  They're cutting him off from his supporters, the great men and women who voted him into office.
[00:39:15.031 --> 00:39:19.075]  And who've stood defiantly with him against all the bullying and attacks.
[00:39:19.795 --> 00:39:25.080]  That's why we're launching Operation 2020 Save the First Amendment at OperationWin2020.com.

[00:40:28.417 --> 00:40:29.559]  But here's the most basic.
[00:40:31.161 --> 00:40:31.922]  Save the first.
[00:40:32.663 --> 00:40:36.148]  Looks like duct tape, but doesn't pull out your whiskers or whatever like duct tape would.
[00:40:36.849 --> 00:40:37.990]  It's a nice, clean sticker.
[00:40:38.331 --> 00:40:39.192]  Goes on your mouth.
[00:40:42.486 --> 00:40:44.367]  And then people say, why are you all wearing that?
[00:40:44.387 --> 00:40:49.990]  You can pull it right off and say, well, because we were being silenced by big tech and we don't want to disrupt the rally like the left would do.
[00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:52.132]  We're just here because there's so many of us.
[00:40:53.212 --> 00:40:56.955]  And upwards of half of a lot of folks, even Rolling Stone reported, they go to these rallies.
[00:40:57.055 --> 00:40:57.955]  It's still massive.
[00:40:57.995 --> 00:40:59.436]  InfoWars shirts everywhere.
[00:40:59.816 --> 00:41:01.717]  Back in 2016, it was half the shirts.
[00:41:01.737 --> 00:41:02.398]  That's how the left went.
[00:41:02.438 --> 00:41:03.378]  God, this is the enemy.
[00:41:03.658 --> 00:41:04.699]  This is who put this guy in.
[00:41:04.719 --> 00:41:05.259]  Well, it's true.
[00:41:05.299 --> 00:41:06.100]  You did it, not me.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.040]  We did it all together.
[00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:11.203]  So save the first InfoWars.com and you just
[00:41:15.137 --> 00:41:16.618]  Remember Owen did this at the Capitol.
[00:41:19.021 --> 00:41:20.682]  And there were people protesting against Trump.
[00:41:20.762 --> 00:41:22.764]  That was allowed, but this was too powerful.
[00:41:25.306 --> 00:41:26.067]  So they arrested him.
[00:41:27.689 --> 00:41:29.770]  So this is the way to go.
[00:41:30.351 --> 00:41:32.373]  Operation win2020.com.
[00:41:32.553 --> 00:41:33.954]  You can also buy the stickers.
[00:41:34.861 --> 00:41:35.061]  I think?
[00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:03.051]  Coming to you live from the recaptured state of Texas.
[00:42:29.582 --> 00:42:31.243]  It's time to save the First Amendment.
[00:42:32.044 --> 00:42:33.865]  It's time for Trump to take action.
[00:42:34.966 --> 00:42:38.808]  We're not going to sit back and hope the bureaucrats get the president to take action.
[00:42:40.229 --> 00:42:43.451]  We're going to take it into our own hands.
[00:42:44.772 --> 00:42:49.516]  Feels good to take action, doesn't it?
[00:42:51.477 --> 00:42:57.321]  I'm going to be at CPAC next week just saying, hey, the First Amendment
[00:43:00.148 --> 00:43:06.490]  Getting Julian Assange out of jail and pardoning Roger Stone, who's sentencing is tomorrow.
[00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.431]  Owen Schroyer and crew are going to be there.
[00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:15.714]  They're getting on a fancy jet aeroplane and flying out to the swamp.
[00:43:19.695 --> 00:43:21.436]  All right, you know, I've talked about for years
[00:43:22.489 --> 00:43:27.072]  Doing a show that's not just callers calling in, but callers that really have interesting things to say.
[00:43:27.112 --> 00:43:29.134]  They all have interesting things to say, but really interesting things to say.
[00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:32.536]  The Crumb Dollar Crumb to do a podcast with them.
[00:43:32.596 --> 00:43:38.681]  And I've just been busy trying to get a big enough crew that'll put up with me so we can do other shows and do specialty shows like that.
[00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:42.564]  And we've got a few of those live shows with the callers as guests.
[00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:48.568]  But the next few segments, I've got some of those folks who were really interesting yesterday and got cut down to like a minute or so.
[00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:50.450]  I've got two of these fillers.
[00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:54.271]  I reckon I'm gonna have them on tomorrow, mmm.
[00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:58.432]  Seem like that fella got something to say that we need to hear a little bit more of, mmm.
[00:43:59.313 --> 00:44:03.014]  So, I reckon I'll have me some taters and mustard, mmm.
[00:44:04.715 --> 00:44:08.276]  You ought not have done that to that boy, Bloomberg, mmm.
[00:44:09.716 --> 00:44:14.398]  Some call it a sling blade, I call it a kaiser blade, mmm.
[00:44:17.162 --> 00:44:21.865]  So we're going to be talking to them coming up here in just a moment.
[00:44:25.727 --> 00:44:26.928]  And then there's so much news.
[00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:28.549]  I'll just be honest with you.
[00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:31.171]  I look at this stuff and then it's just so up at the top.
[00:44:31.191 --> 00:44:35.694]  It almost seems abusive to report this stuff on here.
[00:44:35.994 --> 00:44:37.035]  I mean, to adults.
[00:44:38.616 --> 00:44:45.220]  I say the stuff they're teaching four and five year olds in school, word for word, and stations call up and complain.
[00:44:47.967 --> 00:44:49.808]  And we go, what are we supposed to do?
[00:44:49.848 --> 00:44:51.949]  We understand that this should not be broadcast.
[00:44:52.249 --> 00:44:53.789]  It shouldn't be taught to five-year-olds.
[00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:56.650]  And it doesn't have the effect if you don't say it.
[00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:57.091]  But guess what?
[00:44:57.491 --> 00:44:58.871]  Stations don't call and complain anymore.
[00:44:58.911 --> 00:44:59.552]  They understand it.
[00:44:59.572 --> 00:45:01.192]  Because they see it everywhere too.
[00:45:02.333 --> 00:45:05.114]  It'll be putting a good light pedophilia on the national news.
[00:45:06.074 --> 00:45:09.916]  But then if we say it's bad and play a clip of what was said on the news, we're bad.
[00:45:11.076 --> 00:45:13.777]  Because we're in a lot of Christian stations and conservative stations and I get it.
[00:45:13.957 --> 00:45:15.038]  I don't want to look at this stuff.
[00:45:16.971 --> 00:45:17.771]  But I prayed about it.
[00:45:19.172 --> 00:45:28.097]  And what's allowed all this to happen is not exposing it and then letting the establishment always bring stuff out the way they want to and put it in their light.
[00:45:29.457 --> 00:45:38.522]  And just be doing stuff so nasty, so over the top, so evil, that we just go, whoa!
[00:45:44.505 --> 00:45:47.260]  It's not like it's so horrible we're ashamed to cover it.
[00:45:47.381 --> 00:45:47.984]  It's just like...
[00:45:48.959 --> 00:45:54.784]  You're hit with something this bad, this evil, this over-the-top, and you're just like, I get it.
[00:45:55.204 --> 00:45:58.547]  Because my mind, every day is like, just don't do it to me again.
[00:45:58.607 --> 00:45:59.628]  Just don't make me look at it.
[00:46:00.068 --> 00:46:02.951]  Don't make me, don't, no, no, I have to look at Bloomberg and Hillary, no!
[00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:08.995]  I have to hear, and then hear the lies, and see all the psyops that are running, and know what they're behind.
[00:46:09.076 --> 00:46:12.218]  I mean, I meant to start the show with this today.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.603]  There's a lot of self-loathing that happens because Bloomberg is so bad.
[00:46:19.226 --> 00:46:26.669]  That if I strung together a bunch of things he said and done in a professional report, and just presented it as a newscastry, it would hurt him really bad.
[00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.111]  And there's just too much evil coming in, though.
[00:46:31.171 --> 00:46:37.534]  It's like having a tennis ball machine, where you're supposed to, you know, be hitting one tennis ball every 10 seconds.
[00:46:37.614 --> 00:46:39.195]  It's a tennis ball every half a second.
[00:46:39.235 --> 00:46:41.476]  It's like, tennis balls, tennis balls, tennis balls, tennis balls.
[00:46:41.496 --> 00:46:46.258]  But Bloomberg is
[00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:49.411]  Fabulously evil.
[00:46:51.192 --> 00:46:52.612]  Fabulously horrible.
[00:46:54.133 --> 00:46:57.354]  And his money is everywhere.
[00:46:57.455 --> 00:47:00.836]  And I knew he was buying mayors and governors.
[00:47:01.236 --> 00:47:05.919]  Did you know he pays the salary in hundreds of cities of prosecutors?
[00:47:06.179 --> 00:47:10.821]  Democrats have passed laws where Bloomberg pays the prosecutors in your towns.
[00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:17.554]  Here we are on this live Wednesday, February 19, 2020 transmission.
[00:47:17.574 --> 00:47:20.857]  And for the next two segments, we've got a lot of guests coming up today.
[00:47:21.397 --> 00:47:26.762]  Adam Harry Cassidy is our guest, and Brayden Morrison.
[00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:35.899]  And I've said I'm going to do a whole show that's just callers, where we then get in contact with them and have them on as guests via Skype.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:44.410]  And so, even if I don't start the show soon, every week at least, I'm going to start doing it for a few segments every week with callers.
[00:47:45.888 --> 00:47:49.129]  So Adam Cassidy is the grandson of Harry Cassidy.
[00:47:49.149 --> 00:47:49.950]  We looked all this up.
[00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.351]  He was a key founding socialism as a political force in Canada.
[00:47:54.031 --> 00:47:56.412]  And he has TowerofBabel.ca.
[00:47:56.432 --> 00:47:59.013]  And immediately as I heard him talking, I knew he knew what he was talking about.
[00:47:59.033 --> 00:48:01.334]  So we ought to have you on as a quick guest.
[00:48:01.354 --> 00:48:02.075]  Maybe more after that.
[00:48:02.575 --> 00:48:07.036]  And then Brayden Morrison is an InfoWars listener, caller, and college student in Washington State.
[00:48:07.097 --> 00:48:12.399]  He was just talking about how crazy they are with Kaitlin Bennett being attacked and driven off of
[00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:16.713]  Major University and the media praising it by a rioting mob.
[00:48:17.493 --> 00:48:22.198]  And he's been politically active since he was old enough to watch Dora the Explorer and all that brainwashing.
[00:48:22.218 --> 00:48:26.802]  The only thing he likes more than 90s hip-hop is justice and freedom of the American people.
[00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:30.905]  So I appreciate you both joining us to spend some more time.
[00:48:31.926 --> 00:48:34.909]  Mr. Cassidy, just in a nutshell, because you only had a few minutes yesterday.
[00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:40.552]  You were just getting into why the communist credit tower of Babel, what their plan is.
[00:48:40.572 --> 00:48:46.415]  It's just like Victor Orban just came out and said, he said, Democrats are communists with degrees.
[00:48:47.095 --> 00:48:55.240]  So quantify your knowledge from being part of one of the leading, I looked it up at who you are and confirmed it, one of the leading communist families in Canada.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:03.244]  Well, I see this as a psychosis and they want to teach it to children and the psychosis
[00:49:04.056 --> 00:49:10.777]  It's almost a reversal of the polarity of life where your DNA forms your consciousness.
[00:49:10.837 --> 00:49:23.040]  And I've had complex arguments with people where they say that their consciousness is just a happenstance product of your physical organism's need for a central processing unit.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.340]  But this is a psychotic impression of your own existence.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.721]  It's a third party impression of your own existence.
[00:49:30.461 --> 00:49:31.822]  As if it's happening to you.
[00:49:32.022 --> 00:49:33.483]  So, of course, it's not true.
[00:49:34.303 --> 00:49:36.305]  So, but it's your understanding of life.
[00:49:36.385 --> 00:49:47.372]  So, you manifest this psychosis into that, you know, when you try to make a decision, for example, you send it to the decision-making part of your brain.
[00:49:47.832 --> 00:49:49.833]  And, of course, no decision is made.
[00:49:49.873 --> 00:49:51.194]  You have to make it yourself.
[00:49:51.875 --> 00:49:57.298]  So, you present it back from that part of your brain with a list of decisions that are available to you.
[00:49:57.338 --> 00:49:59.900]  And usually, that list has one decision on it.
[00:50:00.896 --> 00:50:08.344]  So, I mean, I was forced out of the home when I was 15 by this stuff because I was vehemently opposed to it.
[00:50:08.624 --> 00:50:12.988]  And I started to reject the Stalinist slogans and especially the violence in my house.
[00:50:13.449 --> 00:50:16.632]  But my little brother never made it out and he went insane.
[00:50:17.321 --> 00:50:20.283]  So that is the psychosis as far as I can explain it.
[00:50:20.363 --> 00:50:25.727]  All the big studies show communists and leftists are extremely mentally ill.
[00:50:26.027 --> 00:50:27.889]  They can be Hispanic, white, black, Asian.
[00:50:28.809 --> 00:50:33.313]  The numbers of criminality and psychosis is seven to nine times of the studies higher.
[00:50:34.954 --> 00:50:39.017]  Well, if you want to produce criminals and mental patients, take a look at my family.
[00:50:40.031 --> 00:50:47.213]  But I think we're headed for a massive mental health crisis as this psychosis reaches its ultimate apex.
[00:50:47.654 --> 00:50:56.317]  Because these people are starting to realize as they become, you know, 40 and 50 years old, that these ideas are a total failure and their lives are totally empty.
[00:50:56.777 --> 00:51:00.338]  And on top of that, there's nobody to take care of them when they're older.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:08.063]  But Bloomberg, the manifestation of soullessness, telling employees, kill your baby, you'll make more money.
[00:51:08.744 --> 00:51:10.185]  Farmers are the worst people.
[00:51:12.546 --> 00:51:17.229]  He acts like some invading alien would want to sabotage us.
[00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:19.750]  I can't explain to you how insane these people are.
[00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:21.091]  It's a total psychosis.
[00:51:21.131 --> 00:51:23.172]  It's like a demonic possession.
[00:51:23.552 --> 00:51:29.436]  My babies have been aborted in the facilities that my family legalized and fully funded.
[00:51:29.929 --> 00:51:33.170]  Resulting in the death of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
[00:51:33.911 --> 00:51:37.212]  And, you know, I hate to admit it, but there's fully eight of them in my past.
[00:51:38.092 --> 00:51:39.813]  Well, we've all done things we shouldn't.
[00:51:40.133 --> 00:51:41.053]  What matters is the heart.
[00:51:41.674 --> 00:51:42.354]  Quantify this.
[00:51:42.374 --> 00:51:44.335]  Well, it wasn't me doing it, necessarily.
[00:51:44.355 --> 00:51:45.815]  I had no choice in the matter.
[00:51:45.855 --> 00:51:47.676]  Sometimes I didn't even know it had happened.
[00:51:47.776 --> 00:51:48.496]  No, I understand.
[00:51:48.577 --> 00:51:49.377]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:51:50.417 --> 00:51:50.937]  But you're right.
[00:51:50.977 --> 00:51:56.960]  They're coming into a crisis right now, as the minions aren't getting all the utopia they were told.
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:59.361]  Instead, they're getting loneliness and death.
[00:52:00.643 --> 00:52:10.932]  Well let me be clear, I was deeply inside this psychosis until I was 40 years old and for sure completely controlled by it until I was about 20 or 25.
[00:52:12.193 --> 00:52:13.074]  How did you break free?
[00:52:13.114 --> 00:52:20.060]  Just like you said, the innate spirit is actually directing us and going with that and not the outside stimula?
[00:52:22.142 --> 00:52:28.367]  I honestly was just resisting the violent abuse I faced every single day in my home when I got home.
[00:52:29.548 --> 00:52:32.992]  And my brother dropped out of school and was super violent.
[00:52:33.012 --> 00:52:37.257]  In fact, he was actually, I think, in retrospect, terrorizing my parents as well by this point.
[00:52:38.818 --> 00:52:42.362]  And I just I was just trying to kind of make it another day.
[00:52:42.462 --> 00:52:46.327]  I thought that for sure that they were going to incarcerate me in a mental facility.
[00:52:46.907 --> 00:52:48.148]  So I just split and
[00:52:49.171 --> 00:52:53.235]  Uh, hit the streets, and I didn't think I was gonna make it for a long time.
[00:52:53.735 --> 00:52:56.718]  So, when I can't- That's the thing about the left, though.
[00:52:56.738 --> 00:52:57.999]  They love to destroy their children.
[00:52:58.399 --> 00:53:02.923]  Even leftist women brag how they brainwash and brain damage their sons, particularly.
[00:53:02.963 --> 00:53:06.607]  And now, I'm sure you've seen on national news, they say, I killed my baby girl.
[00:53:06.727 --> 00:53:07.207]  I loved it.
[00:53:07.467 --> 00:53:08.228]  I took her life.
[00:53:08.368 --> 00:53:08.969]  I have power.
[00:53:10.265 --> 00:53:25.397]  Well it's crazy, I still can't get a clear answer how I lost my eye as an infant in the home and now my younger brother has blinded himself in psychiatric care in the midst of a complaint about his treatment from me being dismissed.
[00:53:26.118 --> 00:53:31.041]  In the spirit of trying to blind you, that's how I would describe the enemy, is a blinding force.
[00:53:31.581 --> 00:53:38.325]  So I want to go to the other guest caller who's now here via Skype, but that'll be next segment.
[00:53:38.625 --> 00:53:42.027]  I'll probably hold you guys over because there's a bunch of other guests joining us.
[00:53:42.667 --> 00:53:45.408]  I looked into who you said you were, checked it, your family.
[00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:50.611]  I mean, your family, going back as grandparents, leading socialist and communist.
[00:53:51.992 --> 00:53:53.553]  We could do a whole show about them.
[00:53:53.593 --> 00:53:55.554]  Just spend a few minutes talking about them.
[00:53:56.974 --> 00:53:59.936]  Well, I grew up listening to, so we had a big house.
[00:53:59.956 --> 00:54:01.217]  You'd have to see the layout of the house.
[00:54:01.257 --> 00:54:05.680]  We had a big second floor with a banister and I could come out of my bedroom and listen in.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.061]  It was a national amphitheater when they had dinner parties.
[00:54:08.101 --> 00:54:11.223]  So they would put us to bed at like six o'clock when I was nine years old.
[00:54:11.984 --> 00:54:12.704]  I didn't know why.
[00:54:12.724 --> 00:54:14.926]  We didn't have a TV in the house or anything.
[00:54:15.326 --> 00:54:17.007]  And this is downtown Ottawa.
[00:54:17.127 --> 00:54:18.488]  We live basically in a slum.
[00:54:18.968 --> 00:54:26.233]  A guy named Marcel Trudeau owned a lot of property down there, was known as a slumlord and they were fighting him and he was always trying to get our house.
[00:54:27.062 --> 00:54:35.749]  But anyway, they'd have dinner parties and all the NDP alumni, like people like Marion Dewar, who ended up the mayor, and her son Paul Dewar ended up being an MP in Ottawa Centre.
[00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:37.431]  Sure, what was the air coming out of their mouths?
[00:54:38.572 --> 00:54:39.332]  Evelyn Duganis.
[00:54:39.353 --> 00:54:40.954]  Well, they would openly talk.
[00:54:40.974 --> 00:54:44.817]  I mean, it's all in code at first, but then you hear that it cracks.
[00:54:44.837 --> 00:54:52.324]  And they'd openly mock their whole method of, whenever they had nothing to say, they'd say, the people, the people, in their speeches.
[00:54:53.208 --> 00:54:57.190]  Characterize their own speeches and their own work as just being a bunch of nonsense.
[00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:07.934]  And then they would express, you know, their sympathies for the communist system and then it just had to be done right and had a very condescending attitude.
[00:55:08.475 --> 00:55:12.036]  All religion is mental illness to them is delusion.
[00:55:12.056 --> 00:55:14.597]  Because they're the state, they need to be worshipped.
[00:55:15.838 --> 00:55:16.178]  Right.
[00:55:16.898 --> 00:55:20.480]  And so, but everything, all policies are fake, you understand?
[00:55:21.331 --> 00:55:27.616]  It's a Fabian system, and the Fabian system was... That's the bottom line, is they were bragging how what they were teaching the masses was all a big joke.
[00:55:29.237 --> 00:55:29.597]  Yes.
[00:55:30.518 --> 00:55:36.983]  And that their whole method, I mean, they openly, when they got together, I mean, I was also around my father all the time.
[00:55:37.003 --> 00:55:40.706]  He was a blatant communist, ended up leading the NDP.
[00:55:40.726 --> 00:55:48.632]  You know, the first thing he did was kick out the Waffle Ring wing, who were stating their socialist, their more heavily socialist communist principles.
[00:55:49.022 --> 00:55:54.869]  Well, they kicked them out because the famous philosophy used to be, we're not going to tell you where you're going for your own good.
[00:55:55.329 --> 00:55:57.391]  Well, now you're not going to tell you when you've arrived.
[00:55:57.491 --> 00:55:59.594]  So they're going to gut any system.
[00:55:59.734 --> 00:56:03.158]  And I think this is what Trump is dismantling right now with the regulations.
[00:56:03.178 --> 00:56:06.842]  They're going to gut any system and construct their communism inside it.
[00:56:07.438 --> 00:56:09.859]  And keep what's left as a facade.
[00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:21.205]  Now, the whole purpose of the third party was to dilute all elections so that a minority is making the decision to slowly acclimate people to... Well, brother, you know, stay there, Mr. Cassidy.
[00:56:21.225 --> 00:56:23.847]  We're going to come right back with Mr. Morrison as well.
[00:56:23.867 --> 00:56:24.507]  This is powerful.
[00:56:26.428 --> 00:56:28.289]  So, Jacob Ingalls is a reporter.
[00:56:28.329 --> 00:56:29.510]  He's joining us next segment.
[00:56:30.885 --> 00:56:31.766]  He's friends with Roger Stone.
[00:56:31.786 --> 00:56:34.047]  He's been deplatformed everywhere just for covering Roger Stone.
[00:56:34.087 --> 00:56:37.930]  He's had a newspaper and written for major publications for many years.
[00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:41.492]  And he's been banned off PayPal.
[00:56:41.852 --> 00:56:44.954]  He's joining us next segment because this isn't just about censorship.
[00:56:44.974 --> 00:56:49.897]  It's about the total shutdown of society if you don't submit to the way they want you to behave.
[00:56:49.937 --> 00:56:51.719]  So Brandon Morrison isn't in Canada.
[00:56:52.899 --> 00:56:56.281]  He is a college student in Washington State.
[00:56:57.242 --> 00:56:58.403]  Instagram, it's
[00:57:00.399 --> 00:57:01.899]  Radio and Snapchat.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:08.041]  We'll put that up on screen for you so you can visit his contacts if you want.
[00:57:08.721 --> 00:57:15.623]  But you're hearing what it's like to grow up inside one of the famous communist socialist families in Canada.
[00:57:16.103 --> 00:57:29.247]  But you were calling in yesterday just resonating with what Caitlyn Bennett was going through at Ohio University with a crowd of 400 people just driving her off the campus because she was a Trump supporter trying to attack her.
[00:57:30.765 --> 00:57:33.966]  The press praising the whole thing.
[00:57:34.607 --> 00:57:37.708]  So how does this tie together for you?
[00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:48.172]  So it really is a crazy situation because you feel as though you're really behind enemy lines in this sort of situation.
[00:57:49.753 --> 00:57:57.096]  At least at my school, every first year student is required to take this class called College 101.
[00:57:57.956 --> 00:57:59.857]  And now you would think that
[00:58:00.976 --> 00:58:05.078]  Like the main purpose of this class is actually supposed to teach you how to be successful.
[00:58:06.799 --> 00:58:10.121]  That was maybe one week out of the 10 weeks that were in that class.
[00:58:10.261 --> 00:58:27.349]  The rest of it was, it was really trying to brainwash us and make us, you know, feel as though we're guilty about being white or being men because they put us through the scenario where everybody in the class had to sit down and watch
[00:58:30.575 --> 00:58:32.658]  News video called the Privilege Walk.
[00:58:33.479 --> 00:58:37.665]  That's just one example of many examples I can come up with.
[00:58:38.286 --> 00:58:41.551]  But this issue actually goes deeper than just college.
[00:58:42.953 --> 00:58:44.836]  There's examples I could pull from high school,
[00:58:46.184 --> 00:58:47.685]  And even my brother's middle school.
[00:58:48.225 --> 00:59:00.691]  Oh yeah, any education system has been taken over by the communists and the globalists and it's all about you're bad because you're white, you're bad because you're American, you're bad because you're a veteran, you're bad because your dad or mother's a police officer.
[00:59:00.991 --> 00:59:10.315]  This is the most, beyond racism, it's beyond classism, it's communism saying you're a bad person, you need to apologize for who you are and then learn to be a victim.
[00:59:15.322 --> 00:59:18.063]  And again, Brandon Morrison's Skype has been breaking up a bit.
[00:59:18.103 --> 00:59:23.825]  I want to go back to Adam Harry Cassidy here, who grew up in a famous communist home.
[00:59:24.445 --> 00:59:27.106]  Again, his dad headed up one of the main parties there, communist parties.
[00:59:27.906 --> 00:59:38.369]  You're hearing what he's talking about, how they take over organizations, they hollow out groups, and then you think it's the local school district, but it's not.
[00:59:38.389 --> 00:59:39.329]  It's really the communist party.
[00:59:46.207 --> 00:59:58.350]  It's like if you got into any educational institutions and spread any philosophy, when those people came out into the world, it didn't really matter what system they occupied.
[00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:02.010]  That philosophy would become an effective international conspiracy.
[01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:07.391]  So it's like a cult without a name or a charter or a head or a leader or a meaning.
[01:00:07.411 --> 01:00:10.792]  It's probably why McCarthy could never really find it, you know?
[01:00:12.748 --> 01:00:15.770]  Like you said, it's a spiritual psychosis.
[01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:21.833]  Because they always say they're atheists, but when you scratch the surface, they're all into the witchcraft, they're into the occult.
[01:00:22.254 --> 01:00:25.916]  They admit that the occult's exploding onto the left, Satanism.
[01:00:27.076 --> 01:00:27.957]  Did you ever run into that?
[01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:31.419]  Well, not so much.
[01:00:32.059 --> 01:00:37.002]  But, you know, I mean, look, Einstein said it himself, as heat is to cold,
[01:00:37.605 --> 01:00:40.746]  You know, an absence of God is the presence of Satan.
[01:00:42.386 --> 01:00:42.966]  Exactly.
[01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:46.447]  When you're inside this psychosis, it's like this.
[01:00:47.047 --> 01:00:55.089]  You believe that not only your physical body is growing itself, but so is your hormones.
[01:00:55.329 --> 01:01:03.511]  We were expressly told that our hormones were going to start to kick in when we were about 12 years old, and that these were going to physically turn us into adults.
[01:01:04.542 --> 01:01:18.872]  And that was a hard belief system and that was one of the things that I was fleeing was because I literally at the age of 14 wasn't growing physically and certainly was not developing emotionally in that environment at all.
[01:01:18.992 --> 01:01:25.517]  You can take people who have good genes to be big and strong, put them in a communist system and spiritually they shrivel.
[01:01:25.577 --> 01:01:26.878]  They don't thrive.
[01:01:26.898 --> 01:01:28.999]  That's something I've picked up on as well that's been written about.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.861]  We've got Brandon Morrison's Skype working again.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:38.982]  Getting back to what you're talking about, how the exact same thing Mr. Cassidy is saying is they seize all these institutions.
[01:01:40.002 --> 01:01:57.707]  Yeah, and you know, it's almost after what Mr. Cassidy was saying there about like not really developing, that almost seems to be a way that they're able to grab control, not necessarily through physical development, but stunting the growth of your mind.
[01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:03.004]  Well look at, you're starting to cut out again so I'll interject, but yes, I'm going to hold you guys over.
[01:02:04.265 --> 01:02:12.811]  Look at how there's a rest in development in the left, and there's even big articles and studies that the left, a 25 year old is like a 12 year old.
[01:02:13.452 --> 01:02:16.474]  And then now they want to put little boys on hormones or cut their testicles off.
[01:02:16.714 --> 01:02:22.598]  So it is all about not just stunting them, but stealing the birthright, stealing the potential, stealing the destiny.
[01:02:26.656 --> 01:02:27.917]  Yeah, yeah, let's go back to Brandon real quick.
[01:02:27.937 --> 01:02:28.877]  We'll go back to Adam.
[01:02:29.137 --> 01:02:29.958]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[01:02:30.278 --> 01:02:36.061]  Yeah, so really quick, I want to talk about something that was happening at my brother's middle school.
[01:02:36.942 --> 01:02:51.450]  And if this is because of Common Core or if it was because of just like the individual school itself.
[01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:55.212]  But there's this program called Checkology that he had to do.
[01:02:56.341 --> 01:03:00.443]  And what this is, is it's supposed to teach kids about fake news and fact-checking.
[01:03:01.383 --> 01:03:07.446]  And one of the big contributors to this... No, that's Nationwide.
[01:03:07.506 --> 01:03:09.546]  Bloomberg is also a part of this as well.
[01:03:09.967 --> 01:03:14.248]  And also, I decided to go through and check who else was contributing to this.
[01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:21.131]  Media Matters was in there, and just about every single other leftist institution that you can think of.
[01:03:21.711 --> 01:03:22.792]  So these are the people that
[01:03:24.295 --> 01:03:25.656]  We are letting into our schools.
[01:03:26.256 --> 01:03:29.558]  And it's like we're treating it as if it's just another daily thing.
[01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:31.380]  So my question is... You know, that's huge.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.080]  Stop right there.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.661]  Because parents can review a textbook.
[01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:38.044]  But now that it's all digital, that's how they're bringing in the pedophilia, the sexualization.
[01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:43.928]  But exactly, that checkology with Bloomberg, Bill and Melinda Gates, and as you said, many matters.
[01:03:43.948 --> 01:03:44.528]  I've seen that.
[01:03:45.128 --> 01:03:49.872]  Literally demonizing America, President Trump, InfoWars, to little kids.
[01:03:50.752 --> 01:03:51.493]  At middle school.
[01:03:51.513 --> 01:03:57.937]  So let's when we come back, let's talk about that with Brayden Morrison and Adam Harry Cassidy.
[01:03:57.957 --> 01:04:03.441]  And we also have a journalist joining us who has been persecuted for what he's doing.
[01:04:03.461 --> 01:04:07.163]  And of course, he's good friends with Roger Stone, Roger's confidant.
[01:04:07.203 --> 01:04:09.705]  Roger said this is the journalist to talk to when I'm silenced.
[01:04:10.465 --> 01:04:14.528]  So we're going to be talking to Jacob Ingalls of Central Florida Post dot com.
[01:04:14.908 --> 01:04:17.130]  Only place you can find him is Central Florida Post dot com.
[01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:19.091]  He's banned everywhere, including on PayPal.
[01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:20.352]  He's being punished.
[01:04:20.992 --> 01:04:22.833]  We're standing with America.
[01:04:23.753 --> 01:04:25.133]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:04:25.173 --> 01:04:26.134]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:27.354]  Newswars.com.
[01:04:27.814 --> 01:04:28.715]  Ban.video.
[01:04:28.855 --> 01:04:29.895]  Infowars.com.
[01:04:30.555 --> 01:04:34.456]  You put a forward slash show on the end of that and it takes you to the verboten feeds.
[01:04:34.776 --> 01:04:35.657]  Our own audio feeds.
[01:04:35.717 --> 01:04:36.537]  Our own video feeds.
[01:04:36.817 --> 01:04:37.757]  Our own satellite feeds.
[01:04:37.817 --> 01:04:39.358]  Our own radio and TV stations that pick us up.
[01:04:40.178 --> 01:04:41.739]  However you're listening, spread the word.
[01:04:41.799 --> 01:04:42.959]  It's beyond critical.
[01:04:44.796 --> 01:04:46.698]  2020 is a crazy year.
[01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:47.939]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:04:47.979 --> 01:04:50.341]  You don't need me to tell you that to know it's serious.
[01:04:51.962 --> 01:04:54.184]  And you want to be sitting on top of your storable food.
[01:04:54.204 --> 01:04:56.986]  You want to be sitting on top of your firearms, your ammunition.
[01:04:57.046 --> 01:05:00.950]  You want to be sitting on top, right next to neighbors and friends and family you can trust.
[01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:03.592]  That's the best asset in a crazy time.
[01:05:04.132 --> 01:05:07.415]  We know the globalists are throwing a lot of curveballs out there, so now's the time to be prepared.
[01:05:07.435 --> 01:05:08.016]  And I can tell you,
[01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:15.985]  Our big food suppliers, one of the only major food suppliers out there that still has food, and they've got the best high-quality food for the best price you're going to find.
[01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:18.146]  That's why they've been our sponsor for almost 11 years.
[01:05:18.366 --> 01:05:19.367]  They're only 12 years old.
[01:05:19.927 --> 01:05:22.788]  But they were part of a larger group that wanted to do even better.
[01:05:23.189 --> 01:05:25.550]  They broke off, did their own group, became a sponsor.
[01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:28.652]  I wanted people that got high-quality food to people at great prices.
[01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:30.113]  I wanted to have a relationship.
[01:05:30.253 --> 01:05:31.994]  I didn't want five or six food sponsors.
[01:05:32.334 --> 01:05:33.134]  I wanted to have the best.
[01:05:33.735 --> 01:05:36.176]  Just like we do with the water filtration, air filtration, all of it.
[01:05:36.797 --> 01:05:37.157]  And we do.
[01:05:38.207 --> 01:05:39.268]  Um, I've been talking to them.
[01:05:39.288 --> 01:05:40.849]  They're like, it's still 10 to 14 days.
[01:05:40.889 --> 01:05:42.691]  We have the food for another three, four weeks out.
[01:05:42.711 --> 01:05:46.094]  We're buying more, but we're going 24 hours a day to ship it.
[01:05:48.776 --> 01:05:50.037]  This virus looks really bad and
[01:05:52.611 --> 01:05:56.817]  I guess go ahead and just tell people that in a few weeks, it might go out to 20 days.
[01:05:56.837 --> 01:05:57.297]  You gotta wait.
[01:05:57.678 --> 01:05:59.540]  But if you get your order in now, you won't have to.
[01:06:00.562 --> 01:06:02.444]  And obviously, I'm giving us a rest from the virus.
[01:06:02.504 --> 01:06:04.287]  It's even more insane breaking news today.
[01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:06.269]  It's just completely out of control.
[01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:07.251]  Hit some of that next hour.
[01:06:07.291 --> 01:06:08.472]  Paul Watson's doing the fourth hour.
[01:06:09.468 --> 01:06:10.289]  We're good to go.
[01:06:26.478 --> 01:06:27.899]  3.4 ounce and 1 ounce bottles.
[01:06:27.919 --> 01:06:29.079]  We sold out of the 16 ounce.
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:30.960]  That's at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.421]  Vitamin Refusion is back in stock.
[01:06:32.461 --> 01:06:33.001]  It's amazing.
[01:06:33.382 --> 01:06:35.403]  Show is Ultra 12.
[01:06:35.463 --> 01:06:37.444]  It's the best B12 you're going to find out there sublingually.
[01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:41.506]  They're both 40% off, 50% off when you get them together at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:42.006 --> 01:06:47.548]  And of course, the nano patented silver is also in the super silver, tooth whitening toothpaste and super blue.
[01:06:48.749 --> 01:06:53.292]  Fluoride-free toothpaste as well with the tea tree oil and iodine.
[01:06:53.672 --> 01:06:57.074]  So be sure and check out both of those, the Super Blue and the Super Silver.
[01:06:57.494 --> 01:07:05.278]  All right, joining us and then our other callers will pop back in next segment because I want to have them finish up what they're talking about and get more into how media matters.
[01:07:05.358 --> 01:07:06.439]  And Bloomberg,
[01:07:07.259 --> 01:07:09.100]  We've got a whole stack of news actually, pulled it up right here.
[01:07:09.381 --> 01:07:14.484]  Bloomberg's funding your local education, and he wants your guns, and he's funding prosecutors.
[01:07:14.524 --> 01:07:15.204]  Did you know that?
[01:07:15.805 --> 01:07:17.506]  Yeah, we'll tell you about that next segment.
[01:07:17.546 --> 01:07:23.550]  But I wanted to get Jacob Ingalls on because he's a great reporter and a confidant of Roger Stone.
[01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:25.631]  Roger said this is the reporter to talk to.
[01:07:25.651 --> 01:07:27.533]  We've been wanting to get him on for the last week.
[01:07:27.573 --> 01:07:28.113]  Here he is.
[01:07:28.413 --> 01:07:31.335]  CentralFloridaPost.com kicked off PayPal now.
[01:07:31.395 --> 01:07:35.078]  Not just he platformed everywhere, but because you just do honest, decent,
[01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.619]  Not even flamboyant reporting like I do.
[01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:40.701]  I mean, you're not even a gonzo journalist, dude.
[01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:42.922]  You're just like really doing decent reporting for many years.
[01:07:43.403 --> 01:07:44.763]  You've now been kicked off PayPal.
[01:07:44.784 --> 01:07:45.664]  This is so dangerous.
[01:07:47.445 --> 01:07:49.486]  No, no, it's absolutely out of control, Alex.
[01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:56.851]  And actually, they kicked me off of PayPal a couple of months ago as Hurricane Dorian was making landfall in Florida.
[01:07:56.931 --> 01:08:00.213]  So what if that was my only source of accessing money?
[01:08:00.253 --> 01:08:02.434]  What if I ran an online store and merchandise?
[01:08:03.078 --> 01:08:12.085]  Or was doing something like that, or accepted payments from my clients or business associates through PayPal, and a hurricane is hitting, and what if my power went out?
[01:08:12.145 --> 01:08:13.126]  What if I didn't have food?
[01:08:13.146 --> 01:08:14.307]  What if I need to go get water?
[01:08:14.327 --> 01:08:17.069]  The left are racketeering and out of control.
[01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:20.011]  Absolutely.
[01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:20.011]  110%.
[01:08:20.271 --> 01:08:23.454]  And it's not enough to demean us.
[01:08:23.514 --> 01:08:25.335]  It's not enough to destroy our reputations.
[01:08:25.715 --> 01:08:29.618]  It's not enough to shame us, to assault us, to spit on us, to throw milkshake.
[01:08:30.079 --> 01:08:31.760]  They want us broke.
[01:08:32.369 --> 01:08:33.750]  They want us dead.
[01:08:35.091 --> 01:08:45.338]  What did you make of Caitlyn Bennett two days ago at Ohio University, peacefully doing a President's Day interview, and a mob of 400 attacked her, ran her off campus, and newspapers everywhere celebrated it?
[01:08:47.079 --> 01:08:48.500]  It really looked like a cult.
[01:08:48.942 --> 01:08:50.504]  To me, it looked like a cult.
[01:08:50.524 --> 01:08:52.447]  I don't know what's going on on that campus.
[01:08:52.487 --> 01:08:53.628]  Where were the campus police?
[01:08:53.989 --> 01:08:55.771]  Where were the local county or city police?
[01:08:56.172 --> 01:09:01.939]  And what the heck is going on with the faculty and the professors at that college?
[01:09:01.999 --> 01:09:02.901]  They were participating.
[01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:05.584]  Let's talk about Roger.
[01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:10.332]  He will not even talk to me in the last few months, from last month, and I understand.
[01:09:10.352 --> 01:09:13.893]  Other than getting messages, hey, don't talk about my case.
[01:09:13.953 --> 01:09:14.993]  Well, I'm sorry, Roger.
[01:09:15.274 --> 01:09:15.994]  I'm a citizen.
[01:09:16.034 --> 01:09:17.795]  I've been attacked by this judge in the hearings.
[01:09:18.795 --> 01:09:23.377]  They're trying to extend the gag order where no one in the country can talk about it or Roger is punished.
[01:09:23.937 --> 01:09:26.358]  And I've not bowed to Hillary Clinton wanting to have me killed.
[01:09:26.398 --> 01:09:27.418]  So I love Roger to death.
[01:09:27.678 --> 01:09:28.419]  He's an innocent man.
[01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:34.261]  I hope at the sentencing tomorrow, uh, you know, they do the right thing and say, you know, time served or whatever, or Trump's going to have to pardon.
[01:09:34.301 --> 01:09:38.883]  He signaled he will, but, uh, just how's Roger doing?
[01:09:39.343 --> 01:09:40.984]  Uh, just in his spirits, how's his health?
[01:09:41.064 --> 01:09:43.224]  I mean, we're allowed to, is he alive?
[01:09:43.264 --> 01:09:44.985]  I mean, we're allowed to ask certain questions here.
[01:09:45.225 --> 01:09:47.266]  I know that this judge is God on earth, but.
[01:09:49.144 --> 01:09:54.463]  Well, Alex, Roger, like you, like so many of the people watching, is a strong...
[01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:58.535]  He's a dedicated individual to liberty and freedom.
[01:09:59.216 --> 01:10:02.739]  He's had a lot thrown at him and I have not seen his spirit broken.
[01:10:02.879 --> 01:10:04.480]  I have not seen him slow down.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.122]  I have not seen him have any type of health issue.
[01:10:07.442 --> 01:10:12.946]  He's stronger and more motivated than ever to fight for this movement and to fight for this president.
[01:10:13.407 --> 01:10:24.535]  But if you remember a couple of months ago when we were reporting on the tainted bias jury pool, you remember that, this judge, come to find out, ordered a sealed
[01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:31.544]  A sealed order of contempt after we reported on that news and on that juror that was all over Twitter anyways.
[01:10:31.884 --> 01:10:36.245]  And if I had gone into the courtroom the next day, she was going to have me jailed for daring to call out jury bias.
[01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:36.605]  That's right.
[01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:40.646]  The Washington Post called for my arrest and your arrest and had former U.S.
[01:10:40.726 --> 01:10:44.507]  attorneys calling for our arrest on the front of the Washington Post.
[01:10:44.547 --> 01:10:45.487]  That's who these people are.
[01:10:45.687 --> 01:10:48.548]  And it turns out we were right about these jurors being Democratic operatives.
[01:10:48.788 --> 01:10:52.629]  And it's in the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings that what we did was totally legal.
[01:10:54.344 --> 01:10:56.806]  It was totally within the law.
[01:10:56.886 --> 01:10:59.428]  And first of all, it's about holding truth to power.
[01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:07.694]  Just because you put on that black robe and think that you have a lifetime appointment, you can be held accountable and you should be held accountable.
[01:11:07.735 --> 01:11:08.555]  You are not God.
[01:11:08.595 --> 01:11:10.256]  You are not above any other human.
[01:11:11.037 --> 01:11:12.598]  That black robe is meaningless.
[01:11:12.999 --> 01:11:22.286]  And with the way that she's treating her courtroom and the way that she's behaving, it really is just kind of bastardizing and she's bringing shame on the court.
[01:11:24.175 --> 01:11:25.696]  You're going to be covering it in D.C.
[01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:26.357]  so is O.M.
[01:11:26.877 --> 01:11:27.338]  tomorrow.
[01:11:27.418 --> 01:11:28.999]  Gut level, what do you think is about to happen?
[01:11:31.362 --> 01:11:41.511]  I think it's very unlikely that this judge is going to admit wrongdoing, that she's going to admit something happened in her courtroom that she allowed that was illegal and improper.
[01:11:41.811 --> 01:11:47.556]  She hasn't shown any history or pattern of remorse or even fairness.
[01:11:47.717 --> 01:11:48.998]  So you think she doubles down?
[01:11:50.635 --> 01:11:51.496]  I think she doubles down.
[01:11:51.516 --> 01:11:56.381]  I mean, do you really think this Obama-appointed judge is going to sit there and say, oh, I made a mistake?
[01:11:56.842 --> 01:11:57.102]  No.
[01:11:57.883 --> 01:11:58.063]  No.
[01:11:58.103 --> 01:12:04.570]  No, this area has been nothing but belligerent to Trump, even though they've been overturned unanimously by the Supreme Court.
[01:12:06.542 --> 01:12:07.423]  Yep, yep.
[01:12:07.843 --> 01:12:20.555]  And this Obama-appointed judge really needs to consider what she's about to do because I think it puts her at risk legally with her job because she made orders in that court, don't go on social media, don't post about the case.
[01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:25.400]  The jury foreman was on social media posting about the case before the case was over.
[01:12:26.016 --> 01:12:28.137]  That in and of itself requires attention.
[01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:34.602]  And if that judge doesn't address that, is she really abiding by the laws and rules that she set forth?
[01:12:34.902 --> 01:12:35.302]  No, you're right.
[01:12:35.322 --> 01:12:37.504]  She should declare a mistrial now.
[01:12:38.804 --> 01:12:40.085]  Because we've got all the court cases.
[01:12:40.125 --> 01:12:42.547]  I've had all these top lawyers calling on, look at this court case.
[01:12:42.787 --> 01:12:46.009]  If the juror comments on social media about anything, they're out.
[01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:47.910]  Well, she was commenting about Trump and Stone!
[01:12:48.151 --> 01:12:49.011]  The foreman was!
[01:12:49.371 --> 01:12:50.072]  They're done!
[01:12:51.744 --> 01:12:57.746]  Yeah, no, and this juror, Alex, she's saying, oh, I don't watch C-SPAN, oh, I don't do this, I don't do that.
[01:12:58.086 --> 01:13:12.130]  She said about a dozen things that she didn't do or she didn't know about, and then you go and look on her Twitter and Facebook accounts, and it is just rife with postings and content that she claimed she never knew about or never posted about.
[01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:14.850]  And that's why the judge kept saying, don't out the jurors.
[01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:18.071]  It's like, don't out the whistleblower, even though you're supposed to face your case.
[01:13:18.291 --> 01:13:20.272]  Because they're all a bunch of flaming liberals.
[01:13:21.704 --> 01:13:28.992]  Yeah, and Media Matters and everyone, they lost their mind when we were just trying to evaluate what was going on in that courtroom with this jury selection process.
[01:13:29.312 --> 01:13:30.293]  They called for our arrest.
[01:13:30.353 --> 01:13:32.656]  Some of them wanted even worse to happen to us.
[01:13:33.036 --> 01:13:34.818]  And then look, we're right again.
[01:13:34.838 --> 01:13:43.668]  This was a tainted jury and it needs to be declared a mistrial or Trump just needs to pardon them right now and end the kangaroo court.
[01:13:44.127 --> 01:13:45.928]  Well, I appreciate you having the courage to come on.
[01:13:45.968 --> 01:13:46.888]  Nobody else does.
[01:13:47.428 --> 01:13:49.109]  If you talk to Roger, tell him I said hi.
[01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:52.651]  He won't even talk to me other than saying, please don't talk about the case in any way.
[01:13:53.071 --> 01:13:54.872]  Well, I mean, how am I not?
[01:13:55.172 --> 01:13:57.393]  Because he gets blamed when I talk about it.
[01:13:57.453 --> 01:13:58.994]  It's not Roger telling me what to say.
[01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:01.075]  I mean, I'm a news person.
[01:14:01.115 --> 01:14:03.015]  I'm covering a big, famous trial here.
[01:14:03.996 --> 01:14:06.637]  Listen, please come back on tomorrow, Jacob.
[01:14:06.717 --> 01:14:08.738]  Jacob Ingalls, centralfloridapost.com.
[01:14:09.158 --> 01:14:09.798]  You'll come on tomorrow?
[01:14:10.759 --> 01:14:11.039]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:11.519]  Absolutely.
[01:14:11.559 --> 01:14:11.979]  Thank you, sir.
[01:14:13.888 --> 01:14:22.777]  I've really been seeking God's face because I want to be given peace, that quiet place, the Most High that King David talked about.
[01:14:22.798 --> 01:14:27.863]  I need to be given that peace or I'm going to be just torn apart by the fact that I do care.
[01:14:27.883 --> 01:14:29.645]  I don't say that to virtue signal.
[01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:31.146]  I do care.
[01:14:34.096 --> 01:14:40.881]  I care from a very territorial position of people wanting to dominate us and make us slaves so they can control us.
[01:14:41.741 --> 01:14:44.663]  Not from some, oh, I'm so good.
[01:14:44.883 --> 01:14:49.387]  No, I'm wicked and hateful and destructive and I will destroy people that are corrupt.
[01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:53.389]  But I don't have a will to dominate innocents and children.
[01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:57.072]  And that's my problem is I'm not Christ-like.
[01:14:59.212 --> 01:14:59.833]  I'm not Christ-like.
[01:14:59.893 --> 01:15:01.174]  I don't want to turn the other cheek.
[01:15:01.514 --> 01:15:05.238]  I want to literally tear the heads off of the people that are attacking us.
[01:15:05.299 --> 01:15:18.292]  But I understand why the Bible says we need to be controlled and loving and peaceful because then you can go in, not like the psychopaths or sociopaths from a cold-blooded perspective, but from just a controlled perspective
[01:15:19.212 --> 01:15:26.715]  You have the spirit, you have the justice, you have the freedom, you care, but you're able to take control and then execute what you have to do.
[01:15:26.915 --> 01:15:29.236]  And I have not gotten to that point yet.
[01:15:30.216 --> 01:15:38.399]  I constantly try because I want to be able to cut myself off from these people while I fight them because it's sick.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.400]  I don't want to hate them.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:41.681]  That almost gives them, it doesn't almost, it gives them energy.
[01:15:42.421 --> 01:15:51.406]  I want to just see them as a disease or an infestation to be cut out and dealt with, not to get so angry at them and get on their level.
[01:15:52.786 --> 01:15:57.288]  And so I'm working on doing that because it's unhealthy to hate these people.
[01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:05.192]  I'm powered by love of justice, but then the byproduct is I do hate these people.
[01:16:05.232 --> 01:16:06.073]  I hate them a great deal.
[01:16:07.045 --> 01:16:11.388]  But I'm more frustrated that they're able to dominate us when they're so obviously evil.
[01:16:11.408 --> 01:16:22.615]  But you have to understand, they've been divorced from God, from whatever happened when they were children, whatever happened genetically, what happened spiritually, that we need to just somehow transcend the enemy.
[01:16:22.675 --> 01:16:32.381]  Expose them, resist them, but love justice and love God and make our lives about beauty and communing with God and freedom instead of focusing on the enemy.
[01:16:32.541 --> 01:16:33.882]  But you've still gotta focus
[01:16:34.844 --> 01:16:58.680]  Because just like we were talking to Brayden Morrison, who's a student, he was talking about his little brother in middle school, he's a college student, and how they've got this program, it's in the news by the way, we pulled the articles up, what he's talking about, where prosecutors and lawyers and the public defendants and the DAs and the programs in the high schools and the middle schools are run by these leftist groups.
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.681]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:16:59.721 --> 01:17:04.724]  So Brayden Morrison, who's just a caller, but we're more and more going to have callers on as guests,
[01:17:05.244 --> 01:17:06.265]  Yeah, you've been making great points.
[01:17:06.285 --> 01:17:15.353]  Your Skype halts every 30 seconds or so, so we're gonna work on that before we have you back on, but just get back to your brother and get back to that program and tell folks the name of it again so they can look it up.
[01:17:15.473 --> 01:17:17.995]  I'm gonna show TV viewers a few of the articles while you're talking.
[01:17:19.917 --> 01:17:23.099]  Okay, so the program's name is Checkology.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:30.966]  I don't know exactly how long it's been around, but all I know is that when my brother told me that this is what he was doing in school,
[01:17:31.972 --> 01:17:35.996]  I knew that I had to go and check it out for myself, see what it was.
[01:17:37.577 --> 01:17:43.402]  Just because, you know, I've always been really into the sort of political landscape.
[01:17:43.462 --> 01:17:46.244]  I've always wanted to understand how all this stuff works.
[01:17:48.886 --> 01:18:00.076]  But anyways, the question that I asked yesterday when I called in was, how are we able to get passive members of this community
[01:18:00.911 --> 01:18:03.133]  To become active members of this community.
[01:18:03.814 --> 01:18:05.815]  And this is how we fight back against this sort of thing.
[01:18:07.156 --> 01:18:15.904]  I know there's been issues of, you know, various YouTube personalities, social media figures being removed off these platforms.
[01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:28.314]  But much like what our last guest that we just had on, Jacob, said when he was removed from PayPal, if that was the only thing that he was on, then he wouldn't be able to fight back.
[01:18:28.354 --> 01:18:29.075]  He would just be done.
[01:18:30.618 --> 01:18:32.600]  So redundancy is key in this situation.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:33.120]  Absolutely.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.122]  You've got to have a lot of legs in the stool.
[01:18:35.402 --> 01:18:35.622]  Yeah.
[01:18:36.723 --> 01:18:43.828]  If you want to be able to take on these people, then you need to make sure that you're not just putting all of your eggs in one basket.
[01:18:44.409 --> 01:18:50.313]  If people were just on YouTube or just on Facebook, then they wouldn't stand a chance.
[01:18:51.374 --> 01:18:58.400]  But since I know that you had Nick Fuentes on, and actually Owen Troyer had him on a couple of days ago too.
[01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:04.625]  His his backup, his redundancy is DLive, which is another alternative platform.
[01:19:06.166 --> 01:19:13.733]  And so as a way of combating against this sort of situation in my school and in my community, I was actually thinking about
[01:19:14.591 --> 01:19:29.438]  Starting a YouTube channel, but I also understood that if I wanted to do that then I would have to make sure that I had backups so Well, that's it day one you go on and then you use their systems to build another separate platform That's exactly what we did.
[01:19:30.158 --> 01:19:31.759]  So so so let's expand on that.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:39.683]  I Haven't told this story yet because of a lot of reasons and because lawyers have advised me not to do it and
[01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:41.504]  For whatever reason.
[01:19:42.304 --> 01:19:45.767]  And, you know, I'm getting to the point where things go well when I don't listen to lawyers.
[01:19:45.807 --> 01:19:48.969]  Things go bad when I do.
[01:19:49.069 --> 01:19:52.532]  But we know who's funding all these lawsuits against Infowars.
[01:19:53.012 --> 01:19:53.893]  Tens of millions of dollars.
[01:19:54.393 --> 01:19:55.234]  You might have heard of him.
[01:19:55.514 --> 01:19:57.035]  He's a Democratic presidential candidate.
[01:19:57.535 --> 01:20:01.738]  And they're so dumb, they don't know there's Fight Club, where we get sent documents and know.
[01:20:02.379 --> 01:20:06.182]  And somehow people want to just wait like that's some little magic bargaining chip.
[01:20:06.222 --> 01:20:07.483]  No, I think everybody needs to know.
[01:20:08.499 --> 01:20:17.561]  That a certain person doesn't just think farmers suck and doesn't just tell his employees to abort their babies, but funds trying to shut down talk show hosts.
[01:20:18.501 --> 01:20:21.081]  And then also controls the curriculum in your schools.
[01:20:21.101 --> 01:20:23.002]  We just showed the articles backing you up.
[01:20:23.262 --> 01:20:28.843]  Bloomberg paying salary of climate prosecutor working pro bono for Maryland's Attorney General.
[01:20:29.383 --> 01:20:31.643]  And then it goes through all these articles.
[01:20:31.723 --> 01:20:34.564]  Michael Bloomberg is paying a climate prosecutor, there's hundreds of them, $125,000.
[01:20:36.764 --> 01:20:38.165]  Michael Bloomberg is paying climate.
[01:20:38.245 --> 01:20:41.106]  Again, guys, I saw an article this morning about how it's a big national story.
[01:20:41.126 --> 01:20:41.986]  He funds a bunch of them.
[01:20:42.206 --> 01:20:43.847]  So I got kind of the same article over and over again.
[01:20:43.887 --> 01:20:44.707]  It's not just one.
[01:20:45.167 --> 01:20:49.329]  He's funding sheriff's races and DA races everywhere.
[01:20:50.449 --> 01:20:55.471]  Bloomberg accused of hijacking justice system with donor funded climate change prosecutors.
[01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:59.092]  He's putting in, that's Washington Times, his own police everywhere.
[01:20:59.613 --> 01:21:03.214]  So those are some older articles from, you know, May of last year.
[01:21:03.274 --> 01:21:04.394]  There were new articles today.
[01:21:04.434 --> 01:21:05.415]  So just click news, guys.
[01:21:06.115 --> 01:21:06.896]  No big deal, I'll do it.
[01:21:08.377 --> 01:21:11.959]  It's okay, I have this weird OCD thing now where I've got to have the latest thing.
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:19.265]  I thought I sent them a link this morning, but it was Bloomberg under new scrutiny for funding network of prosecutors nationwide.
[01:21:19.825 --> 01:21:22.067]  I'll get it, no big deal.
[01:21:23.187 --> 01:21:26.230]  Let me get Adam Harry Cassidy's take on what we were just talking about.
[01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:34.816]  They're nonsense monsters, and any prepackaged identity will do to put up there.
[01:21:35.796 --> 01:21:40.859]  These people, the core of it is their psyche is built in mid-air.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:45.783]  Most people define themselves by what they are as a soul and what they believe in.
[01:21:45.803 --> 01:21:49.985]  These people define themselves by what they aren't and what they don't believe in.
[01:21:50.226 --> 01:21:52.867]  However, they don't even know what they're not.
[01:21:53.468 --> 01:22:04.175]  So, they're constantly depositing experiences into this void as if other aspects of themselves, their physiology, their subconscious, their unconscious, their this, their that,
[01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:04.987]  Thank you.
[01:22:23.885 --> 01:22:24.665]  Did that make sense?
[01:22:24.826 --> 01:22:25.726]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:22:25.906 --> 01:22:28.087]  Everything about the left is... Yeah, there it is.
[01:22:28.127 --> 01:22:31.109]  Bloomberg does a Soros and buys up law enforcement.
[01:22:31.129 --> 01:22:31.869]  Yeah, yeah, that's one of them.
[01:22:31.889 --> 01:22:32.269]  Print me that.
[01:22:32.289 --> 01:22:34.971]  That's... So, it's true.
[01:22:35.031 --> 01:22:41.654]  You get around these people and they go... Because I've been around Bloomberg, but I've been around billionaires and globals who tried to hire me.
[01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:43.675]  I've listed some of the names and I've had witnesses.
[01:22:44.236 --> 01:22:49.839]  And they go, listen, don't you want hundreds of millions of dollars to live in the best city and to be at the best restaurants with the elite?
[01:22:50.834 --> 01:22:52.594]  And I go, but I don't agree with the policies.
[01:22:52.614 --> 01:22:53.815]  They go, but it's money.
[01:22:54.475 --> 01:22:55.275]  You're gonna be with us.
[01:22:55.375 --> 01:23:00.076]  It's literally, they sit around and go, I've got 50 billion.
[01:23:00.096 --> 01:23:01.177]  It doesn't even mean anything.
[01:23:01.677 --> 01:23:02.997]  And they're like, they're robots.
[01:23:03.057 --> 01:23:10.619]  It's like, they're the scum that would do this, but then they're always funding communism to sabotage us because they don't want competition.
[01:23:10.659 --> 01:23:19.381]  It's a very, how do you juxtapose that, Adam Cassidy, with how the elite funds communism, but they're the offshore billionaires?
[01:23:21.132 --> 01:23:23.474]  Okay, I think back up and look at the big picture.
[01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:27.118]  You're disseminating psychosis throughout the culture as a whole.
[01:23:27.658 --> 01:23:34.725]  The only people who are going to be focused enough in that environment to actually do anything coherent are going to be the psychopaths.
[01:23:34.825 --> 01:23:42.653]  Now, political ponerology, I believe the site's called Ponerology.net, where they talk about how 6% of the human population are psychopaths.
[01:23:43.208 --> 01:23:44.989]  And they inevitably rise to power.
[01:23:45.069 --> 01:23:46.389]  So, what this really is... This is key.
[01:23:46.409 --> 01:23:52.532]  They're creating a docile, dumbed-down group, and they don't want real capitalism because that creates individuals that might challenge them.
[01:23:53.912 --> 01:23:55.033]  It's Satan.
[01:23:55.493 --> 01:23:58.994]  Overall, even from a secular point of view, you can't see it any other way.
[01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:10.218]  It's a satanic spirit taking over the civilization, the culture, making everybody crazy, and the only people left who are going to be able to rule anything are the super psychopaths who want to kill everybody.
[01:24:10.738 --> 01:24:11.879]  Which is the knowledge of evil.
[01:24:14.028 --> 01:24:17.149]  It's not like Adam was this idiot who didn't know what evil was.
[01:24:17.929 --> 01:24:18.690]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:24:18.710 --> 01:24:19.030]  Stay there.
[01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:21.351]  Knowledge of evil means it's evil systems.
[01:24:21.811 --> 01:24:23.111]  You know how to build evil systems.
[01:24:23.612 --> 01:24:24.712]  And that's what knowledge of evil is.
[01:24:24.772 --> 01:24:28.073]  And anybody studies these guys, you learn the knowledge of evil.
[01:24:28.413 --> 01:24:30.654]  And you're like, what the hell are they doing?
[01:24:30.674 --> 01:24:32.595]  But you figure out, man, they got a plan.
[01:24:33.755 --> 01:24:39.798]  Yeah, nobody in regular media just randomly says, hey, let's get a caller on Skype and have them on as a guest.
[01:24:39.818 --> 01:24:40.738]  But I do things different.
[01:24:41.804 --> 01:24:48.390]  And if you're listening to Adam Harry Cash, who we looked up his family is, who he says his dad ended up like the Communist Party in Canada.
[01:24:51.292 --> 01:24:53.714]  It's way more interesting than just some regular guest.
[01:24:53.854 --> 01:24:55.776]  We have a big guest, the author of the U.S.
[01:24:55.816 --> 01:24:58.899]  Biological Weapons Treaty, who's been really pioneering.
[01:24:58.939 --> 01:25:03.963]  Nobody else has been more pioneering on exposing what's really happening with the coronavirus other than Mike Adams.
[01:25:04.003 --> 01:25:05.784]  And Mike Adams was like just stunningly
[01:25:06.705 --> 01:25:08.626]  Okay, so closing comments here.
[01:25:34.409 --> 01:25:46.459]  I was talking about, you know, what could we do as conservatives to try to increase our own platforms even though we're being attacked from basically all sides.
[01:25:47.399 --> 01:25:48.600]  So something that we can do.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.282]  That's being done because we're successful.
[01:25:50.482 --> 01:25:51.382]  So you need to do more.
[01:25:51.843 --> 01:25:54.385]  When you're in a war and you're under attack, it's because you're successful.
[01:25:55.519 --> 01:26:10.209]  100%.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:10.209]  If you've seen what happened with the Groypers going after Turning Point USA, you would know that we absolutely have the power to not only go after just the left, but Conservative Inc., which is also wishing to stun our growth as much as possible.
[01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:12.951]  So something that listeners can do.
[01:26:13.751 --> 01:26:20.596]  If you have, you know, Facebook accounts, really any sort of social media, you know that we're going to end up being censored.
[01:26:21.331 --> 01:26:26.093]  But there's a couple of flaws in the system that people have been taking advantage of for a really long time.
[01:26:26.994 --> 01:26:38.659]  There is, in order to bypass text filters, something that you can do is use letters and characters from other languages that look like the ones in English.
[01:26:39.059 --> 01:26:44.842]  And you're able to get your point across that way because technically the computer thinks that it isn't saying the same thing.
[01:26:45.082 --> 01:26:45.623]  Exactly.
[01:26:46.443 --> 01:26:49.925]  And another thing that we can do is we know that
[01:26:51.610 --> 01:26:55.995]  Pretty much any link to InfoWars is going to be automatically removed.
[01:26:56.776 --> 01:27:07.728]  So another way of getting around that would be to use something called a URL shortener or even another program like AdFly or something like that.
[01:27:08.068 --> 01:27:09.330]  You're able to take the link
[01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:16.247]  And then insert it into this program and it will spit out a totally different link or URL.
[01:27:16.307 --> 01:27:17.628]  You're able to cloak the URL.
[01:27:18.068 --> 01:27:18.468]  It's true.
[01:27:18.829 --> 01:27:19.349]  Yeah.
[01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:23.191]  And we should have you back as a guest just of real world solutions.
[01:27:23.212 --> 01:27:25.793]  That's why we created like News Wars now and Banned.Video.
[01:27:25.813 --> 01:27:26.934]  Those are censored now as well.
[01:27:26.954 --> 01:27:27.454]  But exactly.
[01:27:27.514 --> 01:27:30.136]  Info Wars is the big evil one that they want blocked.
[01:27:30.216 --> 01:27:34.439]  But word of mouth, it's the best to promote because people know that's verboten.
[01:27:35.059 --> 01:27:37.241]  Thank you so much, Brayden Morrison.
[01:27:37.601 --> 01:27:39.182]  And I really want to get you back on.
[01:27:39.562 --> 01:27:42.202]  In the near future on this show and others, we really appreciate you.
[01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:44.403]  Yeah, thank you very much.
[01:27:44.463 --> 01:27:45.183]  I appreciate it.
[01:27:45.483 --> 01:27:55.085]  And anybody out there, if you want to get in contact with me, Instagram is it's underscore Bradio and Snapchat is BradenM1401.
[01:27:55.105 --> 01:27:57.765]  Thank you very much for the opportunity, sir.
[01:27:57.825 --> 01:27:58.845]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:27:59.326 --> 01:28:00.106]  All right.
[01:28:00.406 --> 01:28:01.346]  We only have a minute left.
[01:28:01.386 --> 01:28:02.586]  Thank you for coming on, Adam.
[01:28:02.726 --> 01:28:05.387]  Harry Cassidy, TowerOfBabel.ca.
[01:28:05.447 --> 01:28:07.507]  Talk about the Tower of Babel system real fast.
[01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:16.832]  Well, the software we need for this hardware is a spiritual identity that begins a conception and that you then express into physical reality.
[01:28:17.352 --> 01:28:31.107]  What they want is for you to have no identity except for one that is expressed externally upon you, often by yourself, as you are given no identity to have, but you can choose from outside of yourself.
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.081]  That is the control system as I see it.
[01:28:34.841 --> 01:28:37.502]  You can read more on my blog, TowerBabble.ca.
[01:28:37.542 --> 01:28:42.744]  I'd really like anybody to help me get my brother out of the psychiatric abuse he suffered his entire life.
[01:28:42.764 --> 01:28:46.865]  He's an outpatient on Gilmore Street at Options Bytown.
[01:28:46.985 --> 01:28:48.546]  He's blinded himself now.
[01:28:49.527 --> 01:28:56.232]  After being over-medicated and unattended in multiple self-harm incidents months apart during their dismissal of my complaint.
[01:28:56.672 --> 01:28:57.413]  We're out of time.
[01:28:57.473 --> 01:28:58.294]  Brother, we love you.
[01:28:58.334 --> 01:28:58.974]  We appreciate you.
[01:28:58.994 --> 01:29:02.657]  And what you talk about, they try to give us an identity that's false.
[01:29:03.617 --> 01:29:04.298]  This is the key.
[01:29:04.518 --> 01:29:05.179]  We have identity.
[01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:07.500]  God gives us at birth our destiny and we take it.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:09.201]  And I saw all these fake identities.
[01:29:09.322 --> 01:29:10.322]  I knew my identity.
[01:29:10.663 --> 01:29:12.884]  I knew my destiny from the time I was like two years old.
[01:29:13.284 --> 01:29:14.866]  What you talked about is powerful.
[01:29:15.126 --> 01:29:16.347]  We really appreciate you, sir.
[01:29:16.547 --> 01:29:17.988]  We'll be right back with Dr. Boyle.
[01:29:19.704 --> 01:29:35.264]  Alright, I have not touched the coronavirus today because I was waiting for Professor Dr. Francis A. Boyle to come on, leading American expert in international law, responsible for drafting the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 89, was it adopted into world law?
[01:29:35.885 --> 01:29:39.609]  The American Implementing Legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention.
[01:29:40.190 --> 01:29:45.095]  He served on the Board of Directors of Amnesty International and represented Bosnia-Herzegovina in the World Court.
[01:29:45.135 --> 01:29:50.060]  He served as a legal advisor to the Palestinian Delegation of Middle East Peace Negotiations.
[01:29:50.861 --> 01:29:53.163]  In 2007, he delivered the Bertrand Russell Peace Lectures.
[01:29:53.203 --> 01:29:56.267]  Professor Boyle teaches International Law at the University of Illinois.
[01:29:58.246 --> 01:30:01.391]  And his author of, and he goes through all of the different books he's written.
[01:30:01.411 --> 01:30:06.900]  He holds a Doctor of Law, Magna Cum Laude, as well as a PhD in Political Science from Harvard University.
[01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:18.657]  His latest book is Poems Against the Empire, which is a collection of poetic reflections on his experiences fighting for peace, justice, human rights, international law, social welfare, and the United States Constitution.
[01:30:19.397 --> 01:30:20.617]  And he joins us now.
[01:30:20.638 --> 01:30:22.118]  I would call him a classical liberal.
[01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:24.880]  A liberal today, or a leftist is a fascist.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.661]  It's like a neocon is a fascist.
[01:30:26.681 --> 01:30:27.941]  So the terms don't mean anything.
[01:30:28.541 --> 01:30:29.062]  And he's got
[01:30:30.049 --> 01:30:41.674]  Big breaking exclusive news here, and he sent me notes, but I think the best way to do this is for at least the next three segments, he pretty much hosts, so that he can walk you through this.
[01:30:42.814 --> 01:30:46.036]  But this is serious news.
[01:30:46.076 --> 01:30:47.396]  This is very important news.
[01:30:47.456 --> 01:30:49.237]  Everybody should pay attention to.
[01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:52.238]  The Wuhan coronavirus came out of the BioWare Lab.
[01:30:52.278 --> 01:30:53.819]  That's even being said by the White House now.
[01:30:54.898 --> 01:30:56.579]  Dr. Boyle and others were saying it three weeks ago.
[01:30:57.179 --> 01:30:59.120]  The UNC lab should be shut down.
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:02.141]  Everyone investigated for violating Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act.
[01:31:03.202 --> 01:31:05.903]  I'm just going to, he's got major studies that have just come out.
[01:31:06.443 --> 01:31:09.325]  So he's an expert on bioweapons and the law.
[01:31:09.765 --> 01:31:12.926]  So we've got eight minutes to break here, then a nine minute segment, a 10 minute segment.
[01:31:13.907 --> 01:31:16.228]  I'll take us into break, Dr. Boyle, but you go ahead and host.
[01:31:16.248 --> 01:31:17.548]  You've got the floor here.
[01:31:17.588 --> 01:31:18.189]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:31:19.309 --> 01:31:22.991]  Well, Alex, thank you very much for having me on my best to your
[01:31:23.703 --> 01:31:25.004]  Viewing audience.
[01:31:25.044 --> 01:31:48.934]  Yes, I sent your assistant a email on Monday that I had revised my opinion on certain matters and also I had come up with what I concluded were the smoking guns that the Wuhan coronavirus came out of that BSL-4 facility.
[01:31:49.034 --> 01:31:50.155]  And you'll note now that
[01:31:51.333 --> 01:31:53.475]  Senator Cotton saying the same thing.
[01:31:53.955 --> 01:32:07.886]  He was behind me at Harvard Law School, and despite that, the New York Times lined him, and as you know, Senator Cotton is a decorated combat veteran.
[01:32:08.327 --> 01:32:10.248]  No surprise there from the New York Times.
[01:32:11.069 --> 01:32:13.931]  So, yes, I have these scientific studies now.
[01:32:14.011 --> 01:32:17.053]  Basically, I read these things over the weekend, which is why I
[01:32:20.137 --> 01:32:26.900]  Changed my mind and said I had new information and alerted your assistant on Monday.
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.821]  And today is the first day I could give you an extensive interview.
[01:32:30.981 --> 01:32:39.765]  I want to go through these scientific studies so that you and the viewing audience understand their implications.
[01:32:39.945 --> 01:32:43.106]  I believe they are the smoking gun of what happened here.
[01:32:45.707 --> 01:32:47.468]  The first is by
[01:32:49.289 --> 01:32:59.673]  Some life scientists, three from Marseilles, France, and one from Montreal, clinical research laboratories there.
[01:33:00.874 --> 01:33:07.937]  It was published on Antiviral Research, 10 February 2020.
[01:33:08.597 --> 01:33:13.659]  And I had a chance to read it over the weekend.
[01:33:13.679 --> 01:33:15.600]  I read these types of things over the weekend.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:15.960]  Now,
[01:33:17.386 --> 01:33:27.875]  I'm not going to go through this whole study, but they did a genetic analysis of the Wuhan coronavirus.
[01:33:29.196 --> 01:33:42.428]  And let me just conclude on the critical part here, where it says, quote, and may provide a gain-of-function
[01:33:44.272 --> 01:33:55.461]  to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population compared to other beta coronaviruses.
[01:33:55.841 --> 01:33:56.882]  Let me repeat that.
[01:33:58.183 --> 01:34:11.174]  May provide a gain of function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population compared to other coronaviruses.
[01:34:11.986 --> 01:34:32.931]  So, Alex, you recall in the first interview I gave to your colleague, Mr. Schroer, and then the follow-up interviews I gave to you, I stated that this was clearly a gain-of-function, offensive, biological warfare
[01:34:34.254 --> 01:34:38.595]  You said that three weeks ago, you said that two weeks ago, and now it's not just a big Indian Institute.
[01:34:38.996 --> 01:34:40.976]  Now more live scientists have scanned it.
[01:34:41.276 --> 01:34:42.857]  They're saying exactly what you were saying.
[01:34:43.997 --> 01:34:44.177]  Right.
[01:34:44.317 --> 01:34:46.978]  Well, this article here is the smoking gun.
[01:34:47.738 --> 01:34:48.058]  Okay.
[01:34:48.758 --> 01:34:51.299]  It clearly... And again, tell people again the article and how they find it.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:57.261]  Well, you can... I got it on Science Direct.
[01:34:58.371 --> 01:35:01.173]  Antiviral Research, 10 February 2020.
[01:35:01.394 --> 01:35:04.316]  Antiviral Research?
[01:35:05.357 --> 01:35:06.077]  10 February 2020.
[01:35:06.297 --> 01:35:16.706]  And it's a long title, but it starts out, the spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus contains a fern-like cleavage site absent
[01:35:17.809 --> 01:35:30.874]  So that's exactly what the prestigious Indian Institute said is that it has the points where the artificial RNA was injected.
[01:35:30.894 --> 01:35:32.215]  I mean, they can see right where it happened.
[01:35:33.495 --> 01:35:33.716]  Right.
[01:35:34.136 --> 01:35:39.518]  But this was a genetic, as you know, that was withdrawn under political pressure.
[01:35:40.057 --> 01:35:44.258]  But now we have four very distinguished life scientists here.
[01:35:44.278 --> 01:35:46.219]  Yeah, that's it right there.
[01:35:47.219 --> 01:36:03.545]  And the smoking gun here is on page 11, near the bottom, the last full paragraph from the bottom, where it says, may provide a gain of function to the coronavirus for efficient spreading in the human population.
[01:36:03.785 --> 01:36:07.866]  So explain what that gain of function means, because not all of us are experts on this like you, Doctor.
[01:36:09.269 --> 01:36:28.377]  Right, so let me repeat, Alex, as I've told you before, gain-of-function technology is DNA genetic engineering of dangerous biological warfare substances to begin with.
[01:36:28.497 --> 01:36:31.379]  It's the souping up of already bad pathogens.
[01:36:32.039 --> 01:36:33.960]  Right, it's a turbocharger.
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:38.862]  And gain-of-function work can only be done safely
[01:36:39.602 --> 01:36:44.645]  In a BSL-4 or a BSL-3 facility.
[01:36:45.326 --> 01:36:56.233]  So I think clearly this is the smoking gun that the Wuhan coronavirus came out of that BSL-4 facility.
[01:36:56.313 --> 01:36:59.535]  So does this mirror what the Indian Institute said or is this different?
[01:37:00.854 --> 01:37:07.617]  Well, I think it goes beyond what the Indian study said, but we'll get to that in a minute, the Indian study.
[01:37:08.217 --> 01:37:18.781]  Okay, so I think, you know, I've now provided the smoking gun here.
[01:37:19.321 --> 01:37:29.385]  This is clearly a weaponized biological warfare agent, and there is no legitimate scientific
[01:37:30.217 --> 01:37:37.422]  Or medical use for gain-of-function technology, DNA technology on biowarfare.
[01:37:37.482 --> 01:37:40.403]  So there's no excuse that it's a vaccine test that got out?
[01:37:41.224 --> 01:37:41.904]  That's baloney.
[01:37:42.165 --> 01:37:50.770]  This is clearly an offensive biological warfare agent and it has no legitimate
[01:37:52.351 --> 01:37:56.032]  Well, you know, Alex, we first discussed this over
[01:38:08.428 --> 01:38:20.235]  Uh, three weeks ago, and they're still attacking me for being a conspiracy theorist and fake news and I'm a nutcase and a nutjob and everything else.
[01:38:20.455 --> 01:38:23.017]  So there's been a massive fight back.
[01:38:23.883 --> 01:38:36.291]  In the all the mainstream news media against this and indeed as I told you before I've been completely censored out of all the mainstream news media here in the United States.
[01:38:36.311 --> 01:38:41.215]  But everything you said has been confirmed and now a major scientific groups come out and confirmed it.
[01:38:41.595 --> 01:38:45.778]  Let's get back to that smoking gun and recap that against all the other documentation straight ahead.
[01:38:47.728 --> 01:38:53.312]  Well, we have a leading expert in international law who's led major delegations for the U.S.
[01:38:53.332 --> 01:39:07.843]  government, expert in biological weapons, anti-terrorism, responsible for drafting the Biological Weapons and Anti-Terrorism Act that got adopted as world law, Dr. Francis Boyle here, and I'm reading the same studies he's reading.
[01:39:08.544 --> 01:39:15.309]  So more scientists come out and look at it and say, this thing is man-made, and then they show how, and they say it's conclusive.
[01:39:16.544 --> 01:39:20.339]  You notice major Indian institutes came out and said the same thing three weeks ago.
[01:39:20.359 --> 01:39:21.464]  And so...
[01:39:23.032 --> 01:39:25.033]  We're going to walk through more of these studies in this segment.
[01:39:25.073 --> 01:39:34.199]  Next segment is as a father, as a citizen, as a human, as a citizen of the planet Earth, I'm going to ask Dr. Boyle what he really thinks the endgame is here.
[01:39:34.279 --> 01:39:38.521]  Was this accidentally released as we were hoping and that's bad enough?
[01:39:38.581 --> 01:39:40.342]  Or is it something even more sinister?
[01:39:40.963 --> 01:39:44.365]  Are they using this as the excuse to invade Taiwan as they're now doing?
[01:39:45.005 --> 01:39:47.486]  Dr. Boyle, please continue with the studies.
[01:39:48.187 --> 01:39:51.689]  The spike of... and then we have the whole breakdown here with the study.
[01:39:52.938 --> 01:39:58.681]  Right, well, now let me get to the second study, which is another smoking gun.
[01:39:59.346 --> 01:40:00.486]  And a bombshell, Alex.
[01:40:00.526 --> 01:40:01.466]  There's no other word for it.
[01:40:01.927 --> 01:40:11.228]  You remember in our previous interview, you asked me if this had come out of the BSL-4 facility in Winnipeg, Canada.
[01:40:11.248 --> 01:40:12.809]  It was stolen out of there.
[01:40:12.889 --> 01:40:14.549]  I said that that could have happened.
[01:40:15.449 --> 01:40:18.089]  Winnipeg is our equivalent of Fort Detrick.
[01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:26.151]  They do every type of hideous offensive Nazi-type biological warfare work up there you can possibly imagine.
[01:40:26.872 --> 01:40:34.235]  But again, on the basis of materials, scientific materials, I had a chance to read over the weekend.
[01:40:34.776 --> 01:40:36.656]  I have changed my opinion on that.
[01:40:37.357 --> 01:40:48.962]  I think I have the definitive evidence where this came from, and it came from the BSL-3 Biowarfare Lab at the University of North Carolina.
[01:40:49.622 --> 01:40:51.703]  Now, I have condemned them before,
[01:40:52.808 --> 01:41:18.008]  Because they have done gain-of-function work, DNA genetic engineering, on every hideous biological warfare agent you can imagine, including MERS at that time, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome agent, which again is a biowarfare coronavirus.
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.781]  Now, it just came to my attention.
[01:41:20.801 --> 01:41:22.801]  Say that again, because we're going to pull this up as you speak.
[01:41:22.841 --> 01:41:25.042]  You said the other study, we pulled it up.
[01:41:25.382 --> 01:41:35.185]  The study was their gain-of-function DNA genetic engineering on MERS, which is Middle East Respiratory System.
[01:41:35.205 --> 01:41:36.585]  And that was the University of?
[01:41:37.285 --> 01:41:38.105]  North Carolina.
[01:41:38.706 --> 01:41:38.906]  Right.
[01:41:39.346 --> 01:41:42.887]  They have a BSL-3 biowarfare lab there.
[01:41:43.147 --> 01:41:46.908]  Oh, that's something I keep reading, that they do level 4 stuff at level 3s, right?
[01:41:48.966 --> 01:41:53.047]  I think they are, but they're doing it with the Level 3 that last I saw.
[01:41:53.087 --> 01:41:53.947]  That's all they had.
[01:41:54.588 --> 01:41:57.408]  But let me go through this study.
[01:41:59.989 --> 01:42:10.092]  It's entitled, A SARS-like Cluster of Circulating Bat Coronaviruses Shows Potential for Human Emergence.
[01:42:10.771 --> 01:42:17.236]  So say it again, because we have radio listeners, hundreds of stations, a SARS-like cluster, the name of the paper is SARS-like clusters.
[01:42:17.876 --> 01:42:26.763]  A SARS-like cluster of circulating back coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence.
[01:42:27.003 --> 01:42:31.427]  That's 2000 and that's 2015, December 21st, we have it on screen.
[01:42:31.507 --> 01:42:34.349]  That is correct, in NatMed, that's it.
[01:42:34.869 --> 01:42:39.273]  Now, if you look through this carefully, first notice
[01:42:40.262 --> 01:42:52.330]  Who was involved in this DNA genetic engineering of SARS, which is already a biological warfare agent, to give it gain-of-function activities.
[01:42:53.231 --> 01:42:59.475]  And it has all these people there from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
[01:43:00.056 --> 01:43:04.859]  It has someone from the Food and Drug Administration, so you can't trust the Food and Drug Administration.
[01:43:09.814 --> 01:43:10.915]  Who is involved?
[01:43:13.756 --> 01:43:29.723]  Zhengli Lishi, Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.
[01:43:30.503 --> 01:43:38.887]  So it's very clear to me that this scientist from the Wuhan Institute of Virology
[01:43:39.978 --> 01:43:50.080]  He got this gain-of-function technology for SARS from this University of North Carolina lab.
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.481]  And he didn't steal it, or he or she didn't steal it.
[01:43:54.101 --> 01:44:06.583]  What happened was, if you read carefully to the end of the article acknowledgments, they acknowledged a National Natural Science Foundation of China award.
[01:44:07.654 --> 01:44:24.043]  So, in other words, the Chinese government paid them to have one of their top biological warfare experts involved in this type of... By the way, Dr. Boyle, stay right there.
[01:44:24.684 --> 01:44:24.904]  Sure.
[01:44:25.184 --> 01:44:26.205]  I'm reading the paper.
[01:44:26.225 --> 01:44:30.127]  I know you have big news, you sent us links, but I'm just now reading it.
[01:44:31.534 --> 01:44:33.555]  And you talk about smoking gun.
[01:44:33.575 --> 01:44:37.957]  This is the Chinese government paying for the exact same thing with a U.S.
[01:44:38.037 --> 01:44:38.437]  lab.
[01:44:38.457 --> 01:44:40.337]  How did you discover this?
[01:44:40.638 --> 01:44:41.618]  This is smoking gun.
[01:44:41.638 --> 01:44:42.718]  How the hell did you find this?
[01:44:44.879 --> 01:44:51.842]  Well, Alex, I told you that it's part of my professional responsibilities to stay on top of
[01:44:52.625 --> 01:44:53.646]  Biological warfare.
[01:44:53.986 --> 01:44:57.569]  So I came across it in my research.
[01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:59.551]  That's just part of the job.
[01:44:59.811 --> 01:45:02.794]  Look, you're explaining it very well, sir, but just dumb it down.
[01:45:02.814 --> 01:45:06.097]  Our next guest is great, but we're going to move to tomorrow.
[01:45:06.357 --> 01:45:06.938]  This is too big.
[01:45:07.338 --> 01:45:07.998]  You've got time.
[01:45:08.038 --> 01:45:09.980]  So dumb it down, everybody.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.982]  Why these two papers are so smoking gun?
[01:45:12.002 --> 01:45:13.283]  Because I'm sitting there, look at this.
[01:45:13.523 --> 01:45:14.344]  This is incredible.
[01:45:14.664 --> 01:45:15.665]  This is unbelievable.
[01:45:16.426 --> 01:45:17.307]  I have more than that.
[01:45:19.306 --> 01:45:22.787]  They acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China War.
[01:45:23.247 --> 01:45:45.975]  So, in other words, these death scientists at the University of North Carolina took dirty money from China to allow that one of their top bio-warfare experts from this Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, which has the BSL-4 facility, they knew exactly what they were doing,
[01:45:46.753 --> 01:46:02.426]  And they permitted this Chinese scientist to work with them to give gain-of-function bio-warfare DNA genetic capability to SARS, which is dangerous enough to begin with.
[01:46:03.166 --> 01:46:06.549]  And let me just go through some of the language here.
[01:46:08.084 --> 01:46:10.345]  It is truly a smoking gun.
[01:46:10.805 --> 01:46:25.796]  Clearly that laboratory must be shut down immediately and all those scientists investigated by the United States government for this and their responsibility here and for violating my Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989.
[01:46:27.197 --> 01:46:28.238]  But let me continue.
[01:46:28.518 --> 01:46:29.419]  This is what they said.
[01:46:30.111 --> 01:46:39.126]  We built a chimeric virus that encodes a novel zoonotic spike protein in the context of viable SARS.
[01:46:41.861 --> 01:46:47.287]  This approach characterized the threat posed by SARS coronavirus spike.
[01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:48.469]  Dr. Boyle, stay there.
[01:46:48.509 --> 01:46:49.370]  We got to go to break.
[01:46:49.690 --> 01:46:50.711]  This is so bombshell.
[01:46:50.751 --> 01:46:51.892]  I'm reading the paper right here.
[01:46:52.513 --> 01:46:57.098]  They are admitting that they built the very virus that China paid the U.S.
[01:46:57.118 --> 01:46:58.900]  to build and now that's been released.
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:00.061]  And why did they release it?
[01:47:00.081 --> 01:47:02.704]  So Xi Jinping could grab power and invade Taiwan.
[01:47:02.784 --> 01:47:02.965]  Wow.
[01:47:03.385 --> 01:47:04.566]  This is unbelievable.
[01:47:04.606 --> 01:47:09.708]  No matter what you've ever heard on this show, this is the craziest and the most documented.
[01:47:09.748 --> 01:47:13.349]  This is over the top, and we've caught them red-handed.
[01:47:14.050 --> 01:47:14.830]  Unbelievable.
[01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:15.750]  We'll be right back.
[01:47:15.810 --> 01:47:18.111]  Tell everybody you know to tune in right now.
[01:47:18.131 --> 01:47:18.852]  This is unbelievable.
[01:47:20.272 --> 01:47:31.237]  So, I don't want to get metaphysical here, but my dad is a retired oral surgeon and dentist, and he's also developed some drugs that got approved with the Pentagon and done some other things.
[01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:35.187]  And he's got an office over here and he works here part-time.
[01:47:35.207 --> 01:47:39.149]  And there was something about today's show with Dr. Boyle coming on.
[01:47:39.209 --> 01:47:42.350]  I said, you know, my dad's got that skull from medical school.
[01:47:43.411 --> 01:47:44.091]  That's a real skull.
[01:47:45.679 --> 01:47:54.887]  One of my earliest memories is being like two, three years old and you know the skull's in a black box and I like toddle over and open it up and like drop it on the floor and the German Shepherd ran out in the backyard with it.
[01:47:54.907 --> 01:47:56.028]  My dad got real pissed off.
[01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:57.449]  He said, that's important.
[01:47:57.469 --> 01:47:58.290]  You need to respect that.
[01:47:58.330 --> 01:47:59.171]  That's a real skull.
[01:47:59.671 --> 01:48:03.875]  So one of my earliest memories is a German Shepherd running out in the backyard with a skull.
[01:48:04.496 --> 01:48:05.116]  But it's just funny.
[01:48:05.156 --> 01:48:09.740]  I thought today's show, I don't even know why, I just went and said, Dad, can I put your skull on air?
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:10.941]  Because he's got it in the office over there.
[01:48:10.961 --> 01:48:11.361]  He said, yeah.
[01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:14.370]  Respect the skull and everything.
[01:48:14.991 --> 01:48:18.452]  But the point is, is that this is real.
[01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:19.832]  Something big's going on.
[01:48:19.872 --> 01:48:25.274]  And now I'm looking at all these prestigious reports going back five years ago, how they engineered this.
[01:48:26.034 --> 01:48:28.334]  And Dr. Francis Boyle wrote the U.S.
[01:48:28.374 --> 01:48:30.915]  biological weapons law.
[01:48:31.595 --> 01:48:33.236]  And he's here laying this out.
[01:48:33.456 --> 01:48:35.437]  And I can read the reports.
[01:48:35.557 --> 01:48:39.878]  It's ridiculous how obvious this is that the Chinese paid
[01:48:42.071 --> 01:48:42.631]  A U.S.
[01:48:43.712 --> 01:48:50.636]  university, that's all over the news, Yale and Harvard, are in trouble for 300-something million, but it turns out it's billions total.
[01:48:51.997 --> 01:48:55.599]  That's Wall Street Journal, New York Times, for Chinese communist funding.
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:49:03.064]  So, for whatever reason, we're better at science than they are, and they're getting us to finance and build their surveillance grid, all of it.
[01:49:03.664 --> 01:49:10.909]  So, for whatever archetypal reason today, I'm like, I want a skull on the show today.
[01:49:12.389 --> 01:49:15.651]  I might have showed this skull in 20-something years on air once or twice.
[01:49:16.411 --> 01:49:17.651]  And why did I go get this skull?
[01:49:17.712 --> 01:49:23.154]  I just thought like today I should like do that to point out that we're all human.
[01:49:23.994 --> 01:49:28.817]  And it's like Macbeth, you know, sitting there when they dig up his old teacher and he's talking to the skull.
[01:49:30.091 --> 01:49:31.933]  So, that's all in the middle of this.
[01:49:33.173 --> 01:49:47.785]  Dr. Boyle, please go back to where you were before we went to break, and how big this is, and what's breaking here, and the double smoking guns here, and even more you've got, of where this came from, because that'll give us the answer, hopefully, of where it's going.
[01:49:49.226 --> 01:49:49.426]  Right.
[01:49:49.486 --> 01:49:55.551]  Well, to continue then, it says, this approach characterized the threat posed
[01:49:56.548 --> 01:50:00.511]  Uh, by a spike in primary human airways.
[01:50:01.052 --> 01:50:09.578]  So, in other words, they're designing this to infect human beings by their airways, and then it says in vivo.
[01:50:10.339 --> 01:50:13.921]  So, in other words, they are using live animals.
[01:50:13.941 --> 01:50:14.922]  Slow down and start over.
[01:50:14.942 --> 01:50:17.564]  Again, give them the paper's name again.
[01:50:17.624 --> 01:50:21.147]  This is, this is so huge, they're making it to infect people.
[01:50:21.187 --> 01:50:22.308]  You're right, they should be arrested!
[01:50:23.746 --> 01:50:25.327]  Of course, they should be prosecuted.
[01:50:25.667 --> 01:50:26.828]  No question at all about it.
[01:50:27.508 --> 01:50:30.510]  That's, I think, the one you already had up there.
[01:50:30.650 --> 01:50:31.910]  I'm going to stop interrupting.
[01:50:31.950 --> 01:50:33.191]  Just recap what you just said.
[01:50:33.211 --> 01:50:34.072]  Walk through this again.
[01:50:34.092 --> 01:50:35.172]  Right.
[01:50:35.312 --> 01:50:43.597]  We built a chimeric virus, so they joined these different biological warfare agents together into a chimera.
[01:50:43.757 --> 01:50:47.459]  As I told you, swine flu was a... As you said three weeks ago, it's a chimera.
[01:50:48.319 --> 01:50:49.019]  Chimera, right.
[01:50:50.598 --> 01:50:57.901]  And here they are doing it to have a, quote, spike in primary human airway cells in vivo.
[01:50:58.661 --> 01:51:01.622]  That's surrogates for us, okay?
[01:51:02.402 --> 01:51:18.048]  Now, if you continue here, they took mice and they, with their technique here, found robust replication comparable to SARS.
[01:51:18.468 --> 01:51:18.948]  Wonderful!
[01:51:20.043 --> 01:51:24.224]  So they're using the gain-of-function technology.
[01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:26.445]  They're testing it to make sure it spreads quickly.
[01:51:27.746 --> 01:51:28.226]  That's right.
[01:51:29.246 --> 01:51:31.627]  And it's not just SARS, it's gain-of-function.
[01:51:33.167 --> 01:51:39.630]  Together, the data confirm the ability to infect human airway cells, etc.
[01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:43.511]  So they know exactly what they are doing here.
[01:51:44.583 --> 01:51:50.125]  I mean, just like Ford makes F-150 trucks, you just found who made this and they're openly bragging about it.
[01:51:51.205 --> 01:51:51.425]  Right.
[01:51:51.785 --> 01:51:52.746]  Let me continue.
[01:51:52.826 --> 01:52:06.950]  Together, the data indicate that viruses utilizing what they put together are capable of inducing considerable disease in mice in the context of basically SARS.
[01:52:07.330 --> 01:52:08.151]  Wow.
[01:52:09.531 --> 01:52:12.152]  And again, SARS is the same coronavirus family.
[01:52:13.123 --> 01:52:13.323]  Right.
[01:52:13.663 --> 01:52:15.284]  It's weaponized coronavirus.
[01:52:15.564 --> 01:52:21.526]  They also conclude that they really couldn't find an antibody against it.
[01:52:21.766 --> 01:52:22.026]  Wow!
[01:52:22.066 --> 01:52:24.046]  So, it's extremely dangerous.
[01:52:25.567 --> 01:52:26.147]  Total jerks.
[01:52:27.587 --> 01:52:29.468]  So, let me continue then.
[01:52:29.768 --> 01:52:35.590]  I'm just starting to ask, you know, these people better be arrested really quick.
[01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.530]  Right.
[01:52:37.931 --> 01:52:41.532]  Now, let me continue here where they say
[01:52:43.556 --> 01:52:50.020]  Their new DNA genetically engineered virus constitutes a gain in pathogenesis.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:52.321]  That's gain of function right there, they admit it.
[01:52:52.941 --> 01:52:58.364]  Pathogenesis means lethality and infectiousness.
[01:52:58.444 --> 01:53:02.086]  And we know that even Lancet has said lethality is about 15%.
[01:53:03.587 --> 01:53:08.310]  If you disaggregate numbers even put out by the Chinese government, it's about 17%.
[01:53:10.851 --> 01:53:18.039]  So together these data represent a crossroads of gain-of-function research concerns.
[01:53:21.003 --> 01:53:24.066]  And they just make it clear they're going to continue anyway.
[01:53:25.148 --> 01:53:26.669]  They also point out that
[01:53:27.725 --> 01:53:34.110]  They involve HIV-based pseudovirus prepared as previously described.
[01:53:34.290 --> 01:53:36.391]  Which is what the Indian found!
[01:53:36.551 --> 01:53:38.433]  Oh my God!
[01:53:38.633 --> 01:53:40.034]  That's why I was going to get to that.
[01:53:40.134 --> 01:53:42.435]  Yes, HIV is up in there.
[01:53:42.816 --> 01:53:44.237]  This is ridiculous!
[01:53:45.237 --> 01:53:50.361]  No, no, this is the type of Nazi biowarfare work these scientists do, Alex.
[01:53:50.381 --> 01:53:52.482]  No, I agree, but they're publishing it!
[01:53:53.163 --> 01:53:54.504]  They're admitting they did it!
[01:53:55.757 --> 01:54:02.861]  And let me continue, Alex, in a footnote it says, uh, cells were originally obtained from Fort Detrick.
[01:54:03.541 --> 01:54:06.763]  That's our biowarfare... So that means U.S.
[01:54:06.803 --> 01:54:10.064]  government biowarfare was running this?
[01:54:11.405 --> 01:54:13.046]  They were involved in it too, yes.
[01:54:13.366 --> 01:54:13.726]  Jesus.
[01:54:14.407 --> 01:54:17.648]  So let me ask you this, when you learned this this weekend, what was it like?
[01:54:17.668 --> 01:54:18.829]  Was your heart beating faster?
[01:54:20.811 --> 01:54:30.320]  No, I decided to notify your assistant there Monday morning, and then later that morning, CNN in India
[01:54:31.210 --> 01:54:37.233]  Uh, uh, did an interview with me on this, but that was only for about 20 minutes, and then I had to go back to my teaching.
[01:54:37.813 --> 01:54:39.674]  But, you know, this is what I do professionally.
[01:54:39.694 --> 01:54:41.255]  No, I know, but this is unbelievable.
[01:54:41.315 --> 01:54:44.076]  I'm reading the report right here from five years ago.
[01:54:44.116 --> 01:54:53.681]  They've, they've, obviously, I don't think the university knew that this would be used for this, but what did they think they were doing when they were giving a foreign authoritarian government a, a bioweapon?
[01:54:53.701 --> 01:54:53.821]  I mean,
[01:54:55.768 --> 01:54:57.970]  Right, well, it's all greed.
[01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:59.231]  They were paid for.
[01:54:59.571 --> 01:55:02.233]  It's like you said, they just take the money, like you said three weeks ago.
[01:55:03.494 --> 01:55:06.337]  From communist China and their top biowarfare experts.
[01:55:06.577 --> 01:55:07.418]  Well, here's an example.
[01:55:07.558 --> 01:55:08.779]  I own .50 caliber rifles.
[01:55:09.279 --> 01:55:13.303]  If a known criminal came to me and said, I want to buy them, I'd say, hell no.
[01:55:13.683 --> 01:55:15.725]  You don't give criminals .50 caliber rifles.
[01:55:16.045 --> 01:55:18.387]  Well, a .50 caliber rifle is dangerous, but nothing compared to this.
[01:55:18.867 --> 01:55:20.409]  What the hell is going on?
[01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:21.129]  How are U.S.
[01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:29.273]  Weapons research laboratories, under the guise of safety research, allowed to give the CHICOM stuff like this.
[01:55:29.353 --> 01:55:34.094]  This is, you're right, I've been on there 25 years, I've never seen a scandal this big.
[01:55:34.154 --> 01:55:37.376]  This is, it's all right here, they admit it!
[01:55:38.196 --> 01:55:49.260]  It's even worse than that, because all this work, this biological weapons work, involving the Wuhan virology,
[01:55:50.026 --> 01:56:00.888]  Was approved and funded by the National Institutes of Health, which I've discussed with you before, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.
[01:56:01.673 --> 01:56:01.973]  Okay.
[01:56:02.493 --> 01:56:12.878]  I told you before, these agencies were up to their eyeballs in research, development, and testing offensive biological warfare weapons.
[01:56:12.918 --> 01:56:13.898]  Dr. Boyle, stay there.
[01:56:14.319 --> 01:56:16.079]  You're a great professor and amazing.
[01:56:16.099 --> 01:56:21.622]  When we come back, you've got to recap it all and boil it down for the average viewer, because I'm smart, the viewers are smart, but
[01:56:23.119 --> 01:56:23.580]  I've been on there.
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:24.320]  I'm not just being dramatic.
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:25.321]  I've been on there 25 years.
[01:56:25.361 --> 01:56:27.062]  I've never been this shell-shocked.
[01:56:27.142 --> 01:56:28.943]  I'm reading these mainline reports.
[01:56:28.983 --> 01:56:30.264]  We pulled these up from you.
[01:56:30.464 --> 01:56:31.085]  This is it.
[01:56:31.385 --> 01:56:35.347]  This is the very virus five years ago, cooked up, sold to the Chinese government.
[01:56:36.088 --> 01:56:39.470]  I know you don't speculate, but when we come back, why is it out now?
[01:56:39.810 --> 01:56:40.631]  What's the endgame?
[01:56:40.871 --> 01:56:41.932]  How bad is it going to get?
[01:56:43.737 --> 01:56:47.800]  Going back over a month ago, I was ordering more storable food.
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:50.102]  I was getting prepared because it got level.
[01:56:50.743 --> 01:56:57.908]  I felt that there was a disturbance in the equilibrium of the planet and that I needed to be more prepared with 2020 and all that's going on.
[01:56:58.949 --> 01:57:02.772]  That's why listeners were like, hey, storable food's selling out everywhere like three, four weeks ago.
[01:57:02.792 --> 01:57:03.533]  Why aren't you promoting it?
[01:57:04.013 --> 01:57:05.715]  Well, we're always promoting high quality storable food.
[01:57:06.783 --> 01:57:12.510]  But with all that's happening and with the global is trying to destabilize things, now is the time to get prepared.
[01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:22.681]  We have the best storable food for the price you're going to find out there and they have it in stock and they're ready to ship it out to you within 10 to 14 days because they have to package it.
[01:57:22.721 --> 01:57:23.362]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[01:57:25.416 --> 01:57:28.077]  I hope everything turns out okay with the coronavirus.
[01:57:28.137 --> 01:57:28.997]  It's already out of control.
[01:57:29.398 --> 01:57:30.838]  But I hope that it planes off.
[01:57:31.278 --> 01:57:37.061]  Well, they're saying it'll be a new yearly flu, it's gonna mutate, and it's gonna kill tens of millions, Bill Gates says in Africa alone.
[01:57:37.921 --> 01:57:45.284]  But I have terrible food because I want to sit on top of what my family needs, energy.
[01:57:46.044 --> 01:57:53.127]  Yeah, I've got some insurance and I've got some things like that, but insurance you can eat, like ants bringing food down to their
[01:57:55.936 --> 01:58:00.297]  Their world, instead of a grasshopper that dies in the winter, is so fundamental.
[01:58:01.217 --> 01:58:02.698]  So go to InfoWareStore.com.
[01:58:02.918 --> 01:58:05.558]  My Patriot Supply is our big sponsor for over a decade.
[01:58:05.939 --> 01:58:06.899]  They're in our computers.
[01:58:06.939 --> 01:58:08.159]  They take the orders as they come in.
[01:58:08.179 --> 01:58:11.780]  You go to the head of the line, you lock in your order, you get your storable food.
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:14.281]  We also have the Immune Gargle.
[01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:18.842]  We sold out of the 16-ounce, the 1-ounce, and the 3.4-ounce are going to sell out very, very soon.
[01:58:18.862 --> 01:58:20.262]  The 1-ounce within just a day or two.
[01:58:20.682 --> 01:58:23.303]  The 3-ounce at current sales rates in like a week or less.
[01:58:25.566 --> 01:58:30.772]  And yeah, it's got nanosilver that knocks out viruses and, you know, is really good for you and your family.
[01:58:31.786 --> 01:58:33.487]  But it's stuff we're always promoting.
[01:58:33.507 --> 01:58:39.371]  I mean, I kind of feel guilty even promoting stuff during this crisis, but we were already promoting all of this.
[01:58:39.972 --> 01:58:41.853]  And Vitamin Mineral Fusion is back in stock.
[01:58:42.293 --> 01:58:48.277]  Ultra 12, really high quality organic sublingual B12, it's back in.
[01:58:48.658 --> 01:58:54.642]  And that funds our operation as Bloomberg and others finance the attempt to take us off air.
[01:58:54.702 --> 01:58:56.263]  And you know, I'm not going to get into the Bloomberg thing.
[01:58:56.303 --> 01:58:57.424]  I made the decision this morning.
[01:58:58.124 --> 01:59:04.446]  I'm going to go ahead and get into what we've been given about Bloomberg financing the lawsuits against us, just so you know how evil he is.
[01:59:04.646 --> 01:59:07.746]  And I'm just not going to do it as some little afterthought here.
[01:59:08.146 --> 01:59:16.629]  This is big front and center what we're covering right now with Professor Dr. Francis Boyle and the admissions that a U.S.
[01:59:16.689 --> 01:59:20.609]  university engineered the exact virus now spreading across the world.
[01:59:20.649 --> 01:59:26.711]  So finishing up with its providence, the fact that these are the smoking guns, sir, in synopsis, I know that
[01:59:28.342 --> 01:59:29.583]  Well, let me go back here to this second study.
[01:59:52.995 --> 02:00:01.618]  To point out, it says at the end, quote, the current manuscript has been reviewed by the funding agency, the National Institutes of Health.
[02:00:02.338 --> 02:00:07.780]  Continuation of these studies have been requested and approved by the National Institute of Health.
[02:00:08.481 --> 02:00:18.264]  So notice the National Institute of Health under Fauci is funding this Nazi biological warfare work and
[02:00:19.111 --> 02:00:38.210]  They have approved and requested further development of it, which obviously this study was 2015, and the NIH wanted it to become even a more deadly pathogenetic virus.
[02:00:38.929 --> 02:00:46.134]  And you can also then see here the money from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.
[02:00:46.654 --> 02:00:56.661]  This woman, I think you pronounce her name, Lesmonnier, is out there now in public, or she's up to her eyeballs in this too, as is Fauci.
[02:00:57.281 --> 02:01:06.187]  And finally, I originally condemned this North Carolina lab because doing gain-of-function work on MERS, as I said.
[02:01:06.647 --> 02:01:07.628]  Today in the
[02:01:09.045 --> 02:01:20.077]  USA Today, Tony Fauci admits that the lethality rate of MERS is about 36 percent, whereas SARS is 10 percent.
[02:01:20.758 --> 02:01:24.723]  This Wuhan is 15 to 17 percent.
[02:01:25.183 --> 02:01:30.309]  So notice Tony Fauci and the National Institute are backtracking
[02:01:31.169 --> 02:01:46.510]  No, they know full well that they were paying this North Carolina lab, in cooperation with the Wuhan BSL-4 lab and program, to develop biological warfare weapons.
[02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:54.056]  So is that why Senator Cotton and even the White House are like, hey China, we don't buy the providence of this because they know China paid a U.S.
[02:01:54.116 --> 02:01:55.016]  university to do this.
[02:01:55.356 --> 02:01:57.178]  Let me ask you this then, how bad is it going to be?
[02:01:57.578 --> 02:01:58.579]  Why did China do this?
[02:01:58.599 --> 02:02:07.265]  I know that's speculation, but as just a citizen, not just a lawyer and an expert on this, what the hell, what do you think the endgame is?
[02:02:07.325 --> 02:02:08.326]  Why is this out now?
[02:02:08.666 --> 02:02:10.027]  Was it used against Taiwan?
[02:02:10.307 --> 02:02:12.109]  We know China bought it as a bioweapon.
[02:02:13.874 --> 02:02:21.820]  Well, let me just discuss one more scientific article with you.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:28.125]  Archives of Virology 2010, page 155.
[02:02:29.245 --> 02:02:43.056]  And here, Wuhan was working with an institute in Australia to DNA genetically engineer
[02:02:44.248 --> 02:02:50.753]  A super bio weapon involving SARS and HIV.
[02:02:51.253 --> 02:02:52.193]  That's right in here.
[02:02:52.494 --> 02:02:53.254]  You can read it.
[02:02:53.995 --> 02:02:54.355]  Okay.
[02:02:55.215 --> 02:02:57.557]  And apparently it was successful.
[02:02:58.318 --> 02:03:13.688]  So as far as I can tell, Alex, what happened was the Wuhan Institute of Virology took the, and this was the Australian government knew all about this,
[02:03:14.962 --> 02:03:25.150]  And it says, this work was jointly funded by the State Key Program for Basic Research Grants from the Chinese Ministry of Science, Technology and Knowledge.
[02:03:25.891 --> 02:03:33.897]  So, and the other, this, the other writer here, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, in Australia.
[02:03:34.738 --> 02:03:43.665]  So, as far as I can figure out here, what happened here, Alex, is that the Wuhan scientists
[02:03:44.324 --> 02:04:08.000]  took the North Carolina SARS with Gain of Function, which is already a biological warfare weapon, and they took the technology here behind this well-developed SARS HIV weapon, and they all brought it back to the Wuhan BSL-4
[02:04:09.734 --> 02:04:27.359]  And tried to DNA genetically engineer it into a camera, into a biological warfare weapon involving the coronavirus, the HIV virus, and gain of function.
[02:04:28.479 --> 02:04:29.699]  So it's all clear in the papers.
[02:04:29.739 --> 02:04:30.719]  They admit they did this.
[02:04:30.739 --> 02:04:32.620]  You've reverse engineered it an incredible job.
[02:04:33.598 --> 02:04:35.199]  Do you think it was done on purpose then?
[02:04:35.439 --> 02:04:36.380]  Who stands to gain?
[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:40.182]  Key Bono, as a law professor, who would do this?
[02:04:40.242 --> 02:04:41.063]  Who stands to gain?
[02:04:42.546 --> 02:04:49.249]  Well, clearly China has an extensive biological warfare program.
[02:04:49.309 --> 02:04:49.749]  They have.
[02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:51.670]  Not as extensive as ours.
[02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:59.433]  I mean, we have 12 BSL-4 facilities here in the United States, all doing this Nazi biowarfare work.
[02:04:59.493 --> 02:05:03.274]  They should all be shut down tomorrow, as well as the BSL- Well, I totally agree.
[02:05:03.375 --> 02:05:05.695]  And then giving China the fruits of it.
[02:05:06.056 --> 02:05:09.117]  The CHICOMS can come buy bioweapons from us?
[02:05:10.205 --> 02:05:10.846]  They bought it.
[02:05:11.226 --> 02:05:16.150]  So what is interesting here, Alex, is that they didn't steal it.
[02:05:16.570 --> 02:05:17.070]  They bought it.
[02:05:17.951 --> 02:05:19.332]  And we sold it to them.
[02:05:19.472 --> 02:05:21.054]  And we sold them access to it.
[02:05:21.474 --> 02:05:24.276]  They brought it back to that Wuhan BSL-4.
[02:05:24.376 --> 02:05:26.338]  Is there any race specificness to it?
[02:05:28.365 --> 02:05:35.468]  Well, as I said before, we have seen one black African victim reported that I've seen.
[02:05:35.868 --> 02:05:38.509]  So right now, I am withholding judgment on that.
[02:05:38.670 --> 02:05:41.931]  But, you know, the Chinese put all this together for themselves.
[02:05:42.991 --> 02:05:48.594]  And, of course, they were planning to use it as biological warfare against us.
[02:05:48.974 --> 02:05:50.035]  There's no... I mean, who else?
[02:05:50.135 --> 02:05:52.916]  I guess... So do you think they got it on accident, or what do you think?
[02:05:54.577 --> 02:05:56.858]  As of now, Alex, I think it was an accident.
[02:05:58.469 --> 02:06:04.849]  The BSL-4 facility had leaks of SARS at least twice before.
[02:06:05.552 --> 02:06:07.093]  And I believe it was an accident.
[02:06:07.613 --> 02:06:11.616]  And that is now confirmed by Chinese scientists themselves.
[02:06:12.156 --> 02:06:16.139]  And this is the fourth study I want to put before you.
[02:06:16.399 --> 02:06:16.919]  Stay there.
[02:06:17.079 --> 02:06:21.402]  We'll do five more minutes before Paul Watson takes over with Dr. Francis Boyle, the author of the U.S.
[02:06:21.462 --> 02:06:23.884]  Biological Weapons Convention and all the rest of it.
[02:06:24.644 --> 02:06:28.186]  I've been on here 25 years, folks, and this is just tops it all.
[02:06:28.827 --> 02:06:31.729]  I mean, we're talking about our children, the whole future, everything else.
[02:06:32.625 --> 02:06:33.786]  I had this premonition this morning.
[02:06:33.826 --> 02:06:37.929]  I said, let me just get that skull my dad's got, you know, from his medical days.
[02:06:37.949 --> 02:06:44.414]  Let me bring this in here just as like a little prop to just think about mortality and the fact that we're all mortal.
[02:06:45.035 --> 02:06:45.815]  And there it is.
[02:06:45.895 --> 02:06:47.216]  And now we're just laying this out.
[02:06:47.257 --> 02:06:48.678]  This is just end of day stuff.
[02:06:49.298 --> 02:06:50.739]  If not this, it'll be something else.
[02:06:50.779 --> 02:06:52.340]  I mean, what are these labs doing?
[02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:54.562]  Why are they selling it to foreign governments?
[02:06:54.862 --> 02:06:58.484]  It needs to stop its mad scientist behavior.
[02:06:58.824 --> 02:07:00.585]  They want to reduce world population.
[02:07:01.026 --> 02:07:04.348]  They want to distribute it out so they can deny who did it.
[02:07:04.888 --> 02:07:10.412]  They just want plausible deniability for bioweapons releases and mass population reduction.
[02:07:10.712 --> 02:07:11.813]  That's really what's happening.
[02:07:13.735 --> 02:07:18.942]  We've seen the panic response of governments in action, but the propaganda is everything's fine.
[02:07:19.923 --> 02:07:23.548]  Dr. Francis Boyle is our guest here for another five minutes.
[02:07:23.588 --> 02:07:28.814]  Paul Joseph Watson is set to take back over our guest author.
[02:07:29.929 --> 02:07:30.349]  The U.S.
[02:07:30.889 --> 02:07:32.870]  bioweapons law that became international law.
[02:07:33.610 --> 02:07:49.057]  So in the four minutes we've got left, Doctor, we really appreciate you synopsing or boiling it all down into what you really think is happening in the bombshells and this new study you were trying to get into on top of all the other studies you just talked about.
[02:07:50.117 --> 02:07:50.337]  Right.
[02:07:50.417 --> 02:07:52.278]  This is the latest study.
[02:07:52.398 --> 02:07:53.779]  It just came out this week.
[02:07:55.019 --> 02:07:59.661]  Possible origins of 219-NCOV coronavirus.
[02:08:00.282 --> 02:08:25.756]  What is significant here, you can get it at ResearchGate, what is significant here is that it is by two professors at the South China University of Technology, their own professor, and their conclusion of this study is that the Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility.
[02:08:26.391 --> 02:08:33.837]  So let me repeat, even Chinese scientists are saying now, independently of me, it leaked out.
[02:08:34.818 --> 02:08:38.621]  And I believe it was probably an accident that
[02:08:39.688 --> 02:09:06.586]  There was one of these death scientists there at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility trying to DNA genetically engineer the North Carolina technology, the Australian technology, HIV, SARS, gain of function together into this super biological warfare weapon and somehow got infected.
[02:09:06.966 --> 02:09:09.348]  There's been speculation by these authors that
[02:09:11.329 --> 02:09:16.210]  animal residue, or they breathed it in, or something like that.
[02:09:16.771 --> 02:09:22.213]  That person then got infected, but since it's asymptomatic, they weren't aware of it.
[02:09:22.973 --> 02:09:30.796]  And now, you know, even though they're saying it's 14 days, a British healthcare expert estimated it could be 24 days.
[02:09:32.502 --> 02:09:46.846]  So, whoever this expert was, this death scientist, went out and around and did his normal life activities for the next 14 to 24 days, and it was spread all around Wuhan.
[02:09:46.866 --> 02:09:49.826]  So they were playing with fire and they got burned?
[02:09:51.387 --> 02:09:51.587]  Right.
[02:09:52.267 --> 02:09:53.987]  They shot themselves in the foot, Alex.
[02:09:54.067 --> 02:09:56.728]  That's my assessment at this time, yes.
[02:09:57.637 --> 02:09:57.917]  I think.
[02:10:14.289 --> 02:10:19.335]  Russia has a lot of land there, and China, and not very many people.
[02:10:19.415 --> 02:10:21.617]  Sure, they can wipe out the Russians, that's their target.
[02:10:21.938 --> 02:10:22.558]  Lebensfrau.
[02:10:23.339 --> 02:10:26.162]  And China has a lot of people, and they need more land.
[02:10:26.302 --> 02:10:29.025]  So I'm not ruling out it would have been directed against them.
[02:10:29.045 --> 02:10:30.988]  Sure, China's always been eyeing Russia greedily.
[02:10:31.548 --> 02:10:32.689]  All right, well, powerful.
[02:10:32.869 --> 02:10:34.970]  If you can come back tomorrow or the next day, we need updates.
[02:10:35.011 --> 02:10:36.391]  This is the biggest news ever.
[02:10:36.712 --> 02:10:38.953]  And I'll just say that this is unbelievable.
[02:10:39.294 --> 02:10:42.996]  The reports, the scientific journals, Dr. Boyle, incredible.
[02:10:43.276 --> 02:10:44.537]  What do we call this interview?
[02:10:44.557 --> 02:10:45.298]  We're still live.
[02:10:45.318 --> 02:10:48.340]  I mean, I don't know what to call this once we post it on InfoWars.
[02:10:49.601 --> 02:10:54.544]  Well, Alex, let me also say we can't trust the FBI to do the right thing here.
[02:10:55.045 --> 02:10:58.227]  They lied about, they covered up and they sabotaged
[02:10:58.855 --> 02:11:03.036]  The Amerithrax coming out of Fort Detrick.
[02:11:03.636 --> 02:11:12.359]  So we are going to have to get some other federal law investigative agencies in here to deal with that North Carolina... And you've authored the U.S.
[02:11:12.419 --> 02:11:16.020]  law on bioweapons, so I think you're quite the authority on that.
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:19.520]  So again, please join us again tomorrow or whenever you can, Dr. Boyle.
[02:11:19.981 --> 02:11:24.342]  Very powerful information and just amazing.
[02:11:24.362 --> 02:11:24.962]  Thank you so much.
[02:11:26.038 --> 02:11:37.103]  Well, thank you, Alex, and I do hope you can get this out around the world because the mainstream news media in the United States and Europe has been blacklost, blackballing me and blacklisting me.
[02:11:37.123 --> 02:11:37.503]  Well, sure.
[02:11:37.583 --> 02:11:39.224]  I don't even know what to call this.
[02:11:40.245 --> 02:11:45.047]  Smoking gun, Wuhan virus, man-made spreading worldwide, cover-up.
[02:11:45.107 --> 02:11:49.209]  I mean, China bought, weaponized Wuhan virus from the U.S.
[02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:50.489]  Thank you, Dr. Boyle.
[02:11:50.529 --> 02:11:51.890]  Paul Watson takes over right now.
[02:11:56.049 --> 02:11:58.350]  My life is nothing but a comedy.
[02:12:00.551 --> 02:12:01.412]  Orange man.
[02:12:02.553 --> 02:12:03.133]  Still bad.
[02:12:03.153 --> 02:12:08.396]  If you rearrange the letters in the name Donald Trump, they spell Plod Turdman.
[02:12:08.416 --> 02:12:11.658]  So, orange man.
[02:12:12.638 --> 02:12:12.938]  Bad.
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:17.221]  Orange man destroyed.
[02:12:17.301 --> 02:12:18.922]  Plod Turdman.
[02:12:18.962 --> 02:12:19.282]  Trump.
[02:12:20.923 --> 02:12:21.263]  Gloomf.
[02:12:22.403 --> 02:12:23.644]  Blimp.
[02:12:23.704 --> 02:12:24.004]  Cramp.
[02:12:25.005 --> 02:12:25.225]  Riff.
[02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:30.210]  Claude Turdman!
[02:12:34.513 --> 02:12:35.593]  Karen, I'm home.
[02:12:35.873 --> 02:12:37.214]  Did you hear what Drumpf said?
[02:12:38.015 --> 02:12:39.375]  Yes, I heard about Drumpf.
[02:12:39.976 --> 02:12:40.956]  Orange man, bad.
[02:12:40.976 --> 02:12:42.117]  This is Jonathan.
[02:12:50.959 --> 02:12:52.560]  He needs a place to stay tonight.
[02:12:53.340 --> 02:12:54.740]  It's an honor to have you here.
[02:12:55.180 --> 02:12:58.342]  We're very privileged and I'm happy to share everything with you.
[02:12:58.462 --> 02:13:00.002]  Plod turd man!
[02:13:00.062 --> 02:13:00.862]  You're not laughing?
[02:13:00.962 --> 02:13:04.104]  I just made my one millionth drumpf joke and you're not laughing?
[02:13:04.124 --> 02:13:06.184]  The system that knows so much.
[02:13:07.005 --> 02:13:13.647]  You decide what's right or wrong the same way that you decide what's funny!
[02:13:23.849 --> 02:13:33.362]  Meanwhile in the UK, supermarket Tesco had to apologize for telling people not to steal female menstrual products.
[02:13:33.562 --> 02:13:39.650]  Women, trans men or anyone who menstruates should not have to worry about being reported for taking a necessity that I personally
[02:13:39.710 --> 02:13:41.091]  Shoplifting is now progressive.
[02:14:08.524 --> 02:14:16.606]  The contraception shortage in the UK has apparently caused chaos for women wanting to have promiscuous, unprotected sex.
[02:14:18.387 --> 02:14:19.047]  Hoes mad!
[02:14:19.167 --> 02:14:20.907]  No, not the hecking Pillerinos!
[02:14:20.947 --> 02:14:23.828]  You don't understand, I need to have promiscuous sex, consequence-free!
[02:14:23.888 --> 02:14:24.909]  No!
[02:14:24.969 --> 02:14:33.091]  The degenerate hellscape of modern hypergamous relationships that has contributed to record high levels of depression and suicide in young people...
[02:14:34.171 --> 02:14:34.871]  That's fine.
[02:14:36.032 --> 02:14:39.873]  Wanting to embrace traditional gender roles and become a trad wife?
[02:14:40.574 --> 02:14:42.074]  That's a form of extremism.
[02:14:42.094 --> 02:14:58.681]  According to the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that partners with national governments, Google and others, to quote, counter hate and extremism in the UK, women who choose to be subservient to men in the framework of a traditional marriage are comparable to the brides of ISIS terrorists.
[02:14:58.721 --> 02:14:59.822]  This is where we're at.
[02:15:04.601 --> 02:15:11.566]  Meanwhile, UK TV host Philip Schofield was universally celebrated after announcing that he was gay.
[02:15:11.726 --> 02:15:14.208]  Fantastic, stunning and brave.
[02:15:15.528 --> 02:15:20.952]  Just a shame he couldn't have been stunning and brave a little earlier instead of lying about it to his wife and kids for 27 years.
[02:15:21.012 --> 02:15:24.595]  I think I have to speak on behalf of all of us when I say that we've got nothing but love and respect for you.
[02:16:00.535 --> 02:16:05.018]  Sky News devoted three of their top four headlines to Schofield's announcement.
[02:16:05.058 --> 02:16:12.582]  The Daily Mail offered a running commentary on Schofield's every movement, reporting the monumental news that he had arrived home.
[02:16:13.383 --> 02:16:22.148]  The stampede of enthusiasm was so vehement that Buckingham Palace was forced to deny rumours that the Queen had abdicated her throne and that Schofield had been proclaimed king.
[02:16:26.271 --> 02:16:37.336]  And as Schofield was being lauded for ending his 27-year marriage, over in Australia, a mother of four was being publicly shamed on national television for making her husband breakfast.
[02:16:37.356 --> 02:16:38.996]  I want to take you back to the 1950s.
[02:16:39.537 --> 02:16:41.417]  Brooke Smith shared her routine online.
[02:16:41.457 --> 02:16:42.238]  Here's what she said.
[02:16:42.638 --> 02:16:51.622]  I always make sure I don't go to bed until everyone's lunches are packed, their clothes are set out for the next day, including my husband's, and the house is clean, dishwasher is on, and a load of washing is on.
[02:16:52.142 --> 02:16:57.310]  I always get up early, 4.30, with my husband to make his breakfast and coffee.
[02:17:00.455 --> 02:17:01.155]  Go, Brooke.
[02:17:01.855 --> 02:17:02.316]  Whatever.
[02:17:02.496 --> 02:17:07.117]  Taking care of your spouse and children within the context of a fulfilling monogamous marriage.
[02:17:07.477 --> 02:17:09.378]  The sheer temerity!
[02:17:09.818 --> 02:17:11.839]  Has he hypnotised her or something?
[02:17:11.859 --> 02:17:13.360]  Who does this stuff?
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:17.301]  Making his breakfast and then putting his clothes out of a night?
[02:17:17.381 --> 02:17:18.541]  Who does this stuff?
[02:17:18.741 --> 02:17:22.263]  Apparently only ISIS terrorists, brides and tradwife extremists.
[02:17:22.383 --> 02:17:24.764]  My only theory is that she might actually like her husband.
[02:17:24.784 --> 02:17:25.864]  Alright, Shemima Begum.
[02:17:28.305 --> 02:17:33.770]  Meanwhile, back in London, Sadiq Khan revealed the winner of the award for diversity in advertising.
[02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:37.653]  An advert that was so diverse it featured zero white people.
[02:17:37.733 --> 02:17:42.197]  Celebrating different body types and skin tones which are underrepresented in advertising.
[02:17:42.397 --> 02:17:48.403]  Except body types like this, which are underrepresented because you banned them.
[02:17:48.463 --> 02:17:55.229]  Strange how the only advertisement seen in London that lacks diversity is the one telling white people to sterilize themselves.
[02:17:58.122 --> 02:17:59.202]  Paul, brother.
[02:18:00.203 --> 02:18:00.843]  It is time.
[02:18:01.963 --> 02:18:03.823]  You must call out the Egglessons again.
[02:18:04.403 --> 02:18:05.844]  They are ruining our birth rates.
[02:18:06.564 --> 02:18:10.965]  The sexual revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.
[02:18:11.145 --> 02:18:12.325]  I am the Eggman.
[02:18:12.345 --> 02:18:14.785]  I like this boy.
[02:18:15.606 --> 02:18:17.386]  And he likes someone else.
[02:18:17.566 --> 02:18:18.766]  I am the Eggman.
[02:18:18.786 --> 02:18:23.827]  I am the Eggman.
[02:18:23.847 --> 02:18:26.668]  I am the one who runs.
[02:18:32.603 --> 02:18:50.352]  In entertainment news, I'm excited to see Rage Against The Machine's comeback gig at the Capital One Arena, the 11th biggest financial institution in America that helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the early 90s, enslaving an entire generation with mountains of consumer debt.
[02:18:50.452 --> 02:18:51.472]  Let's fight the power!
[02:18:51.552 --> 02:18:53.633]  When the avant-garde becomes the god.
[02:18:53.753 --> 02:18:55.033]  Fringe against the machine.
[02:18:55.113 --> 02:19:02.516]  Woke actress Jameela Jamil was criticised for being cast in an LGBT interest TV show when she's straight.
[02:19:02.596 --> 02:19:03.676]  Jameela's response?
[02:19:04.136 --> 02:19:05.857]  She suddenly announced that she was queer.
[02:19:05.957 --> 02:19:06.717]  Checkmate, bigot.
[02:19:06.997 --> 02:19:13.563]  I mean, she's been in a relationship for the past five years with musician James Blake, who last time I checked, was a man.
[02:19:13.703 --> 02:19:18.407]  And before him, she had a long-term relationship with another man she described as her first love.
[02:19:18.467 --> 02:19:20.309]  But yeah, you're queer now, Jamila.
[02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.889]  Okay.
[02:19:23.676 --> 02:19:28.599]  Next time someone calls me an Islamophobe, I'll just instantly convert to Islam.
[02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:36.446]  A Filipino climate activist wrote an article for Vice saying she left the environmental movement because it was too white.
[02:19:36.566 --> 02:19:40.088]  The climate movement is overwhelmingly white, so I walked away.
[02:19:40.209 --> 02:19:45.313]  The authors of the Emancipation Proclamation are overwhelmingly white, so I continued my life as a slave.
[02:19:45.373 --> 02:19:48.875]  Those awful white people and their spins wheel.
[02:19:49.756 --> 02:19:51.177]  Trying to save the planet?
[02:19:51.257 --> 02:19:56.722]  According to CNN, there are also too many white people attempting to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
[02:19:56.742 --> 02:20:00.905]  So, Riley, what has been helpful to you in combating racism?
[02:20:02.306 --> 02:20:07.230]  I think it's helpful and important to talk to other white people about racism.
[02:20:08.211 --> 02:20:10.112]  And I think a lot of people
[02:20:11.428 --> 02:20:12.749]  They don't want to be racist.
[02:20:12.929 --> 02:20:14.390]  They don't think that they're racist.
[02:20:14.850 --> 02:20:21.174]  But they also don't know some of the things that they believe or say are and can be racist.
[02:20:21.315 --> 02:20:24.016]  Frankly, there's just too many white people in here.
[02:20:24.076 --> 02:20:29.100]  Because it does make some of us POCs uncomfortable when we see too many white people in here.
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:29.540]  Broke.
[02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:31.982]  We are live, and I'm gonna try this again.
[02:20:32.002 --> 02:20:33.943]  We've got a headline up on summit.news.
[02:20:34.163 --> 02:20:38.366]  UK hospitals to deny care to racist or homophobic patients.
[02:20:39.241 --> 02:20:52.604]  Of course, over the past two years we've had this massive wave of de-platforming from social media websites, from mail servers, from payment processors, even in some cases from banks and financial institutions.
[02:20:53.465 --> 02:21:01.767]  Well now, a new rule set to take effect in April, and I actually wrote about this a couple of months ago when it was first being proposed, now it's going into practice.
[02:21:02.267 --> 02:21:06.008]  By the way, under a Conservative government this is taking place.
[02:21:06.849 --> 02:21:13.333]  Patients deemed to be racist or homophobic will be denied care in NHS Trust hospitals under these new rules.
[02:21:14.293 --> 02:21:20.357]  It says currently staff can refuse to treat non-critical patients who are verbally aggressive or physically violent towards them.
[02:21:21.197 --> 02:21:29.562]  Well now they're going to include and extend that to harassment, bullying or discrimination including homophobic, sexist or racist remarks.
[02:21:30.502 --> 02:21:35.525]  Of course the problem being, just on the face of it that's ridiculous, but the problem being
[02:21:36.642 --> 02:21:40.124]  Older people getting treatment don't know what racism is in 2020.
[02:21:40.685 --> 02:21:41.665]  I'll give you an example.
[02:21:42.265 --> 02:21:46.828]  In the UK, older people still use the term coloured people.
[02:21:47.188 --> 02:21:49.550]  Of course, it's woke to say people of colour.
[02:21:49.570 --> 02:21:50.410]  That's acceptable.
[02:21:50.810 --> 02:21:56.474]  A lot of older people over the age of 50, 60, 70 use the term coloured people.
[02:21:56.514 --> 02:21:57.995]  That's not politically correct.
[02:21:58.375 --> 02:22:03.418]  That's deemed racist in today's modern parlance of politically correct speech codes.
[02:22:04.122 --> 02:22:08.204]  What is the line on what's going to be determined to be racist or homophobic?
[02:22:09.125 --> 02:22:15.449]  And what is the line on what's going to be determined to be critical and non-critical care?
[02:22:16.349 --> 02:22:18.470]  There you see somebody on Twitter joked about it.
[02:22:18.971 --> 02:22:24.374]  This is going to be hilarious when a boomer is denied his double bypass because he called someone coloured on Facebook.
[02:22:25.899 --> 02:22:34.749]  And there's other examples of this as Jack Montgomery highlights in late 2017 an NHS patient who requested a female nurse to carry out a cervical smear.
[02:22:35.447 --> 02:22:49.835]  Complained that when the hospital sent a person with an obviously male appearance, close cropped hair, male facial appearance and voice, larger number of tattoos and facial stubble, who insisted my gender is not male, I am a transsexual.
[02:22:50.415 --> 02:23:01.781]  So are people who are going to ask questions about being treated for female procedures by an obviously biological male, are they going to be called transphobic?
[02:23:02.161 --> 02:23:03.762]  Are they going to be denied care?
[02:23:04.801 --> 02:23:14.766]  As I write in the article, this is even worse than China's social credit score, which hasn't yet gone so far as to punish people by withdrawing medical treatment if they engage in wrong think.
[02:23:15.486 --> 02:23:19.848]  Now you can be denied plane and train tickets if you criticize the government.
[02:23:20.208 --> 02:23:25.851]  As far as I know, no one's being denied actual hospital treatment for expressing wrong think.
[02:23:26.591 --> 02:23:32.374]  So again, this is the tiptoe to absolute unbridled totalitarianism.
[02:23:32.884 --> 02:23:42.230]  It went from social media websites, it went from de-platforming people from bank accounts, mortgages, now basic hospital treatment.
[02:23:43.050 --> 02:23:45.652]  And of course, what is critical, non-critical care?
[02:23:46.052 --> 02:23:53.777]  If you're an elderly patient with health problems, it can go from non-critical to critical very quickly.
[02:23:53.857 --> 02:24:00.921]  Somebody else posted on Twitter, don't get sick in the UK if you've ever posted grooming gang statistics.
[02:24:01.693 --> 02:24:02.654]  That's exactly it.
[02:24:02.714 --> 02:24:05.315]  What is the barometer of what will be considered racist?
[02:24:05.375 --> 02:24:18.161]  Maybe you've got a social credit score history, I'm talking about five, ten years into the future, that has deemed you to be racist and deemed you unsuitable for hospital care under these new rules.
[02:24:18.181 --> 02:24:25.025]  And again, this is all being introduced under a conservative government in the United Kingdom.
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:27.481]  People asked if this was a real story.
[02:24:27.521 --> 02:24:28.842]  Yes, it's a real story.
[02:24:29.202 --> 02:24:31.984]  This is going to take effect in April.
[02:24:32.624 --> 02:24:34.305]  And of course, is it going to work the other way?
[02:24:34.325 --> 02:24:41.189]  Are non-white people who make racist statements, are they going to be denied hospital treatment?
[02:24:41.310 --> 02:24:44.351]  Or is this all going to be applied in one direction?
[02:24:44.511 --> 02:24:45.112]  I wonder.
[02:24:45.652 --> 02:24:46.853]  In a related story,
[02:24:47.958 --> 02:24:55.761]  Breitbart reports judge rules against police that acted like Cheka Gestapo Stasi over online transgender jokes.
[02:24:56.481 --> 02:25:06.884]  This was a guy called Harry Miller, who has won his high court freedom of speech battle against Humberside police over his right to make jokes about transgenderism on social media.
[02:25:07.445 --> 02:25:11.826]  Now, as far as I remember, he didn't even tweet this.
[02:25:11.906 --> 02:25:17.528]  He merely liked a tweet, which was a limerick making fun of transgender people.
[02:25:18.638 --> 02:25:24.641]  There's Miller himself, an ex-cop who was incensed when Humberside Police sent a police officer round his home.
[02:25:25.821 --> 02:25:32.004]  Bearing in mind we've got record violent crime across the entire United Kingdom, but this guy likes a tweet about transgenderism.
[02:25:32.265 --> 02:25:33.185]  A limerick.
[02:25:34.185 --> 02:25:40.048]  Enough police resources to send a police officer round to his home in order to, quote, check his thinking.
[02:25:40.148 --> 02:25:41.629]  That was the term they used.
[02:25:41.729 --> 02:25:42.830]  Literal thought police.
[02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:47.772]  After remarks he had made on Twitter were classified as a non-crime hate incident.
[02:25:50.077 --> 02:25:51.679]  Now the judge has responded to this.
[02:25:52.639 --> 02:25:59.085]  He said the claimant's tweets were lawful and there was not the slightest risk he would commit a criminal offence by continuing to tweet.
[02:25:59.445 --> 02:26:11.676]  I found the combination of the police visiting the claimant's place of work and their subsequent statements in relation to the possibility of prosecution were a disproportionate interference with the claimant's right to freedom of expression.
[02:26:12.417 --> 02:26:15.980]  Bearing in mind that this guy's employer
[02:26:16.644 --> 02:26:32.240]  At the time that this was in the news, or before it was even in the headlines, was given a call by the police and asked if any transgender people were working in his place of work because they might feel unsafe because he liked a limerick on Twitter.
[02:26:34.542 --> 02:26:36.444]  The judge continued in his statement,
[02:26:38.206 --> 02:26:41.808]  In this country, we've never had a Cheka, a Gestapo or a Stasi.
[02:26:41.848 --> 02:26:43.968]  We have never lived in an Orwellian society.
[02:26:44.029 --> 02:26:51.952]  Well, they're literally arresting mothers in their own kitchens with their babies next to them for saying that biological men are men on Twitter.
[02:26:51.992 --> 02:26:56.994]  So I would argue that that's somewhat Orwellian, beyond anything Orwell could ever imagine.
[02:26:57.954 --> 02:27:06.498]  However, the court ruling is unlikely to resolve much because the judge did not accept Miller's wider challenge against the College of Policing Guidelines on hate crime.
[02:27:07.535 --> 02:27:20.905]  These define a hate incident as any non-crime incident which is perceived, perceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by hostility or prejudice against a person who is transgender or perceived to be transgender.
[02:27:21.406 --> 02:27:31.754]  So they investigate it if the victim perceives it to be a hate incident, not based on any impartial objective evidence or eyewitness statements whatsoever.
[02:27:32.114 --> 02:27:33.475]  If the victim perceives it to be
[02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:38.352]  A hate incident, then it's logged and investigated as one.
[02:27:38.372 --> 02:27:44.157]  And of course, you've seen the behavior of people like Jessica Yaniv over in Canada.
[02:27:44.457 --> 02:27:56.986]  Of course, people who claim victimhood status and wrap it in themselves as a form of identity, as a very means of existence, of course they're going to claim that anything that offends them is a hate incident.
[02:27:57.587 --> 02:28:01.189]  Police get called out, not like we have record stabbings across the country.
[02:28:02.110 --> 02:28:03.051]  Article continues,
[02:28:04.013 --> 02:28:19.300]  Clearly if one of the plans of the Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings, Preeti Patel law and order faction in the new administration is to restore common sense to the English justice system, much work still needs to be done to strip out the entrenched political correctness introduced during the Blair years.
[02:28:19.961 --> 02:28:22.862]  Not only are they not stripping it out, they're advancing it.
[02:28:23.282 --> 02:28:31.006]  They've literally just passed rules that say if you're perceived, again it's all about perception, to have made a racist statement
[02:28:31.855 --> 02:28:35.818]  While you're visiting hospital then you can be denied hospital treatment.
[02:28:35.858 --> 02:28:40.602]  So they've done nothing to roll it back and everything to entrench it even more.
[02:28:41.002 --> 02:28:45.646]  And yet they still have the temerity to call themselves the Conservative Party.
[02:28:45.666 --> 02:28:49.609]  We're going to come back in the next segment to talk about new stats out of Paris.
[02:28:50.757 --> 02:28:57.140]  Which revealed that nearly half of all criminals in some areas of Paris have a migrant background.
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:00.541]  We're also going to get into the latest on the coronavirus outbreak and more.
[02:29:01.062 --> 02:29:02.422]  Summit.News will be back.
[02:29:02.682 --> 02:29:03.283]  Don't go away.
[02:29:04.323 --> 02:29:04.823]  And we are back.
[02:29:05.604 --> 02:29:08.945]  And we have a headline up here on nationalfile.com.
[02:29:09.225 --> 02:29:14.708]  Reads, TPUSA's cringe meme guy once made video comparing Trump to Mussolini.
[02:29:15.188 --> 02:29:17.209]  In fact, I tweeted something in relation to this.
[02:29:18.485 --> 02:29:20.026]  earlier about the MAGA types.
[02:29:20.086 --> 02:29:21.067]  The MAGA types of 2020.
[02:29:21.587 --> 02:29:32.173]  There's got to love how the MAGA movement is completely comprised of everyone who hated Trump in 2016 while everyone that loved him has been locked out and publicly shamed.
[02:29:32.853 --> 02:29:43.159]  Now of course there were many of us who were somewhat reluctant to jump on board the Trump train back in early 2016 until we figured out, you know, that it was a real America first movement.
[02:29:43.959 --> 02:29:47.061]  A lot of people who eventually glommed on to that movement
[02:29:47.688 --> 02:29:53.469]  have a very distinct history of despising, in some cases trashing, President Trump.
[02:29:53.509 --> 02:29:54.330]  And this is one of them.
[02:29:55.050 --> 02:30:09.854]  By the way, if you don't know, there has been a huge war between what is termed Conservative Inc, what is termed the Groiper movement, in terms of trying to push Conservative Inc towards embracing truly Conservative principles.
[02:30:09.894 --> 02:30:13.234]  That has been a big turf war over the past three or four months.
[02:30:14.195 --> 02:30:15.175]  TPUSA,
[02:30:16.041 --> 02:30:20.203]  And they have a sister organisation in the UK called TPUK.
[02:30:20.263 --> 02:30:25.526]  And again, all the people in that organisation, many of the people at the top of that organisation are not bad people.
[02:30:26.006 --> 02:30:30.008]  Some of them are my friends, some of them later got out of that whole movement.
[02:30:31.009 --> 02:30:43.375]  But again, they're so paranoid about optics that in the case of TPUK, right at the beginning of it, and this came out a couple of days ago on a Twitter account called Grifterwatch,
[02:30:44.338 --> 02:30:55.410]  They had a list of people right at the start of this movement in the UK, the UK version of it, back, I think it was 2018, early 2019, who they could not associate with.
[02:30:56.111 --> 02:30:57.533]  Guess who was on that list?
[02:30:57.573 --> 02:31:00.196]  Well, yours truly, Sargon of Akkad.
[02:31:00.756 --> 02:31:00.997]  Other
[02:31:01.767 --> 02:31:11.901]  What would be described as centrist YouTubers and in fact at the very start TPUK wanted to disassociate themselves with Nigel Farage.
[02:31:12.402 --> 02:31:18.310]  That's how nervous they were about being smeared by the media by the left as too right-wing.
[02:31:19.241 --> 02:31:26.205]  Of course, Nigel Farage has probably been the most instrumental politician in the UK for decades and decades.
[02:31:26.806 --> 02:31:30.348]  So that illustrates how nervous they were right at the start.
[02:31:30.688 --> 02:31:33.029]  I don't really care if they want to disassociate from me.
[02:31:33.089 --> 02:31:36.011]  I wasn't associated with them in any official capacity anyway.
[02:31:36.591 --> 02:31:41.874]  But the fact that they were scared of being affiliated with Nigel Farage probably tells you everything.
[02:31:42.555 --> 02:31:44.896]  TPUSA has some of the same problems.
[02:31:44.936 --> 02:31:47.678]  We've had people like Nick Fuentes on the show to discuss that.
[02:31:48.559 --> 02:32:07.169]  Well, now it's emerged that TPUSA's cringe meme guy, Benny Johnson, by the way, this is a guy who gives interviews where he says, we need to connect young people to politics because they're disconnected to politics because they find it so opaque, so boring.
[02:32:07.669 --> 02:32:15.673]  So the way to do it is to hook them in by combining the politics with the memes, by reaching young people with the memes.
[02:32:16.323 --> 02:32:24.951]  The problem is, you have to use memes that aren't dated and only recognized and understood by 50, 60 year old boomers.
[02:32:25.511 --> 02:32:31.877]  Now don't get me wrong, we love our boomers, but there's literally a video of this guy and others.
[02:32:32.577 --> 02:32:43.147]  For example, at the TPUSA event in Florida, I think it was December last year, where he gets up on stage, but before he gets up on stage, they play a video intro
[02:32:43.812 --> 02:32:52.314]  Where he's saying that the left can't meme and he's literally stood in front of this graphics projection of a bunch of memes from 2016.
[02:32:52.554 --> 02:32:56.755]  Like it's probably time to update the memes at this point.
[02:32:57.315 --> 02:33:09.738]  They post memes on their Instagram page of the Riddler from a movie that's literally like 50 years old and will not be recognized or understood by anyone under the age of 40 or 50.
[02:33:11.627 --> 02:33:16.733]  So if you're going to connect with the young people via memes, probably time to update the memes.
[02:33:17.714 --> 02:33:27.866]  But a lot of these people have been caught as being grifters because back in 2016 they were firmly against President Trump, only later jumped on the bandwagon.
[02:33:29.073 --> 02:33:31.374]  Mainly to create careers for themselves.
[02:33:31.454 --> 02:33:50.278]  In the UK we've had people jump on the Conservative Party bandwagon, again pretending to be pro-Brexit, pretending to be true Conservatives, when in fact they're just grifting because they want to embed and ingratiate themselves into social circles and into the Conservative Party establishment.
[02:33:50.838 --> 02:33:56.779]  But if you go back on their tweets, and even not that far back in some cases, their true
[02:33:57.621 --> 02:34:02.645]  Ideals and their true alignments are well known and in fact very concerning indeed.
[02:34:03.646 --> 02:34:16.017]  Now a 2016 video made by Turning Point USA's chief creative officer comparing President Donald Trump to Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini has resurfaced on the internet.
[02:34:16.937 --> 02:34:18.739]  And this was posted earlier today.
[02:34:19.980 --> 02:34:24.624]  Four years later after his sudden departure from the Daily Caller after his ethics were called into question,
[02:34:25.382 --> 02:34:28.843]  Benny Johnson works for the allegedly pro-Trump TPUSA.
[02:34:29.383 --> 02:34:31.024]  And then it talks about the Groyper Wars.
[02:34:32.464 --> 02:34:42.266]  But then it talks about this meme where he's literally on his own Facebook page in 2016 comparing Donald Trump to Benito Mussolini.
[02:34:42.307 --> 02:34:51.589]  And this is one of the head guys now at TPUSA apparently via the medium of memes trying to get Donald Trump re-elected.
[02:34:52.310 --> 02:34:54.593]  Now beliefs can change, ideals can change.
[02:34:54.973 --> 02:35:05.124]  The tactics certainly haven't changed and if you're using memes from 2016, if you're using memes from 50-year-old movies about the Riddler, not really going to connect with young people.
[02:35:05.865 --> 02:35:10.990]  Jaden McNeil tweeted, Benny went from attacking Trump to Conservative Inc.
[02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:14.354]  Gatekeeper remind me who are the real Conservatives again?
[02:35:15.655 --> 02:35:23.498]  That's interesting because they will use the same rhetoric, the same language that they used against Trump in 2016.
[02:35:24.258 --> 02:35:36.822]  They'll use that same rhetoric, those same smear tactics, those same false denunciations against people in this America First movement in 2020, despite the fact that
[02:35:38.223 --> 02:35:43.445]  All those people in the America First movement were actually behind the great meme war of 2016.
[02:35:43.525 --> 02:35:46.566]  Now they're being thrown under a bus by Conservative Inc.
[02:35:47.167 --> 02:36:01.052]  who, if you go back to their own Facebook profiles back in 2016, were trying to throw President Trump under the bus using some of the very same rhetoric that they're using now against people that they deem to be too right-wing.
[02:36:01.953 --> 02:36:05.434]  So again, how paranoid do you need to be at this point when
[02:36:06.152 --> 02:36:12.836]  An organisation like TPUK was scared of embracing Nigel Farage into their political movement.
[02:36:13.276 --> 02:36:17.239]  Not in 2016, not in 2015, but in 2019.
[02:36:18.199 --> 02:36:26.504]  And of course he later went on to be a spokesman for that TPUK movement, but not before they were concerned about associating with him.
[02:36:26.584 --> 02:36:30.006]  So, you know, really makes you think, really makes you think.
[02:36:30.867 --> 02:36:33.048]  In terms of what's going on with the coronavirus,
[02:36:34.048 --> 02:36:37.170]  We had two deaths in Iran that were announced earlier today.
[02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:45.917]  We've also got this headline from Zero Hedge.
[02:36:45.997 --> 02:36:54.524]  Last week I highlighted a video where the detainees at the quarantine camp were being forced to perform dance manoeuvres.
[02:36:55.164 --> 02:36:56.505]  Nothing more Orwellian than that.
[02:36:56.525 --> 02:37:02.690]  We've now got a video in this Zero Hedge article which shows them being paraded around some kind of medical facility.
[02:37:03.556 --> 02:37:17.906]  And they're being asked to shout, Qingshan stay strong, which is obviously the area they're from, but they're being forced to sing loyalty songs to their local government, their local area, as they're being herded into a detainment camp.
[02:37:18.726 --> 02:37:22.669]  Meanwhile, Wuhan mother speaks out, no beds, no medicine, all lies.
[02:37:23.690 --> 02:37:26.512]  And again, this comes back to the central question of
[02:37:27.538 --> 02:37:31.699]  China lying about the severity and the source of the outbreak.
[02:37:31.739 --> 02:37:41.423]  We had a major report out of a prestigious trusted university in China a few days ago saying that the source of the coronavirus was this Biosafety 4
[02:37:43.204 --> 02:37:56.587]  Biological lab that situated 200, one of their facilities was situated 280 meters from that meat market which we were told was the alleged source of the coronavirus outbreak.
[02:37:57.027 --> 02:38:07.969]  This prestigious university study conducted by biological scientists found that it was actually the bio lab facility situated 280 meters away.
[02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:09.789]  So a lot of people in China are still
[02:38:10.484 --> 02:38:16.867]  Trying to get this truth out, trying to claim that the severity of the outbreak is way worse than they're being told by the Chinese Communist Party.
[02:38:17.428 --> 02:38:27.553]  Meanwhile, as I'll get into after the break, the WHO and social media companies continue to crack down on quote misinformation about the coronavirus.
[02:38:28.093 --> 02:38:33.336]  Again, solidly trusting whatever the Communist Party out of China is telling them.
[02:38:33.436 --> 02:38:34.056]  Don't go away.
[02:38:34.156 --> 02:38:35.537]  Summit.News will be back.
[02:38:36.855 --> 02:38:40.598]  I'm going to get into a few final news stories here in a second.

[02:40:01.903 --> 02:40:07.687]  Headline on summit.news, new stats reveal nearly half of all criminals in Paris ghettos have migrant background.
[02:40:08.387 --> 02:40:19.198]  Because the very existence of no-go zone ghettos was denied and debunked as a conspiracy theory by much of the media for several years at the height of the refugee crisis.
[02:40:19.919 --> 02:40:27.086]  Well now, according to newly released statistics, in some areas of Paris, almost 50% of criminals have a migrant background.
[02:40:27.647 --> 02:40:29.649]  This is out of French newspaper Le Figaro.
[02:40:30.734 --> 02:40:38.319]  Mainstream newspaper, which reports that in certain departments the number of foreign-born criminals is as high as 47.6%.
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:46.685]  These figures are from the National Observatory of Delinquency and Criminal Responses, reveal that crimes carried out by unaccompanied youth increased by 22.7%.
[02:40:46.725 --> 02:40:51.248]  This is from 2016 to 2019, right after that wave of migrants poured into cities like Paris.
[02:40:58.303 --> 02:40:59.663]  And you noticed the difference.
[02:40:59.723 --> 02:41:00.924]  Believe me, you noticed.
[02:41:01.664 --> 02:41:08.126]  In fact, I remember going to Paris in 2015 and going back in late 2016 and the difference was very noticeable.
[02:41:09.347 --> 02:41:13.768]  For example, pickpocketing offences committed by younger migrants have risen from 15.8% in 2016 to 31.7% in 2019.
[02:41:13.868 --> 02:41:14.948]  So you're talking about basically doubled.
[02:41:14.988 --> 02:41:15.749]  Burglaries in Paris
[02:41:24.161 --> 02:41:30.166]  Carried out by young migrants rose from 2.1% in 2016 to 13.1% in 2019.
[02:41:30.226 --> 02:41:31.447]  That's a massive spike.
[02:41:32.228 --> 02:41:40.395]  While foreign youth involvement in violent robberies also surged from 4.8% in 2016 to 16.6% in 2019.
[02:41:41.476 --> 02:41:47.000]  Of course, France, like the UK, has a massive problem with knife attacks and violent crime in general.
[02:41:48.419 --> 02:41:58.385]  And the stats also revealed that 120 knife attacks occur in France on an average day, with 44,000 victims of knife crime being reported every single year.
[02:41:59.545 --> 02:42:02.947]  So France continues to enjoy its cultural enrichment.
[02:42:03.708 --> 02:42:14.614]  Meanwhile a new study, or a survey to be more accurate, it's an online survey, finds people who identify as left-wing more likely to have been diagnosed with a mental illness.
[02:42:15.652 --> 02:42:17.093]  The data speaks for itself.
[02:42:17.213 --> 02:42:29.318]  This was a survey carried out by Slate Star Codex, an online survey website, which collected a wealth of data from people, and I looked at the questions, there were probably like 200 questions in this survey.
[02:42:29.338 --> 02:42:37.721]  I asked them to identify their educational, demographic, lifestyle, and political views, and then asked them
[02:42:38.584 --> 02:43:02.232]  If they've been formally diagnosed with depression, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, and it found that people who occupy the left-wing political positions, the more extreme, the more correlation, tend to have more likely to have been formally diagnosed with depression, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.
[02:43:02.872 --> 02:43:04.913]  This is a trend that I noticed years ago.
[02:43:06.218 --> 02:43:19.956]  With people on Twitter, especially people in the UK, who would viciously attack me for my tweets and my videos, it was stunning how when I researched the history, the background of these people,
[02:43:20.620 --> 02:43:24.822]  They all had massive problems with depression and mental illness.
[02:43:24.922 --> 02:43:29.124]  Now, God forbid, I'm not saying that mental illness and depression isn't a big deal.
[02:43:29.684 --> 02:43:33.045]  With opioid abuse at record levels across America, of course it is.
[02:43:33.605 --> 02:43:48.812]  But in every single case, I noticed that these people had massive problems with self-loathing, and there seems to be a correlation between people who have problems with self-loathing and people who identify as left-wing.
[02:43:49.824 --> 02:43:52.745]  Try and figure out what causes that correlation.
[02:43:53.206 --> 02:44:02.430]  The results show that the highest percentage of respondents, 38% who admit being diagnosed with forms of mental illness, also identify politically as Marxist.
[02:44:02.970 --> 02:44:08.133]  In comparison, just 12.1% of conservatives say they've been diagnosed with a mental disorder.
[02:44:08.873 --> 02:44:12.695]  And as I state in the article, while the survey is by no means scientific,
[02:44:13.425 --> 02:44:32.421]  It does give an insight into how disturbed people are more likely to be attracted to fringe leftist beliefs, which in a lifestyle sense, and by the way these people were asked to map out their lifestyles, their behavior, usually encouraged degeneracy and a lack of moral responsibility.
[02:44:32.881 --> 02:44:40.428]  So no doubt that self-loathing people tend to more identify with left-wing beliefs that give them a free pass
[02:44:41.371 --> 02:44:51.859]  to jettison any sense of moral responsibility, and of course live their lives claiming that they're depressed, that it's an outside force causing them to behave in certain ways.
[02:44:52.979 --> 02:44:55.461]  That's why they're attracted to left-wing beliefs.
[02:44:55.541 --> 02:44:57.663]  It was a survey of 8,000 people.
[02:44:57.723 --> 02:45:01.005]  It was by no means a small pool in that survey.
[02:45:02.426 --> 02:45:08.651]  Meanwhile, after failing with Worm Burgers, Norwegian grocery chain to launch Cricket Burgers.
[02:45:10.296 --> 02:45:11.997]  The first trial failed.
[02:45:12.298 --> 02:45:14.920]  Now they're going to go back and say, well, people didn't want to eat worms.
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:16.661]  Maybe they'll want to eat crickets.
[02:45:16.721 --> 02:45:17.322]  And who knows?
[02:45:17.362 --> 02:45:29.231]  I mean, as I saw in this article, there was a Mexican restaurant in Soho, New York City, where the cricket burgers were apparently a surprise hit, in the words of the New York Post.
[02:45:30.272 --> 02:45:35.596]  Of course, we know why they're promoting eating bugs and eating worms, because
[02:45:36.793 --> 02:45:57.188]  Our standard of living is going to be dramatically reduced if they get in these global warming green New Deal programs, if they successfully demonize the meat industries, the milk industries, and forces all over to this high protein and oh-so-trendy diet of eating things like mealworms and bugs.
[02:45:57.909 --> 02:46:03.273]  Well now in Norway, supermarket many, this is the supermarket chain in Norway,
[02:46:04.193 --> 02:46:13.135]  Scrap the idea of Worm Burgers after insufficient demand, imagine that, but seem convinced they can stir up enthusiasm for people to chomp down on insects.
[02:46:14.515 --> 02:46:30.699]  Horn Hein, who's the communications manager of this company, told news website E24, quote, it is difficult to see whether Norwegian consumers are more open to insects in a burger than bread, but the link to testing alternative protein sources such as insects is probably more closely linked to a burger.
[02:46:31.679 --> 02:46:36.242]  And the crickets contain 60% protein.
[02:46:37.082 --> 02:46:38.844]  It's very easy to create the burgers.
[02:46:38.884 --> 02:46:48.389]  They just grind, grind, grind down the crickets and mix them with flour, make them into a bug patty and serve it to their consumers.
[02:46:48.430 --> 02:46:55.434]  They made some of the staff for this many corporation test the cricket burgers and apparently they were very appetizing.
[02:46:55.714 --> 02:46:57.055]  The respondents to the article
[02:46:58.126 --> 02:47:00.327]  Didn't seem so enthusiastic.
[02:47:00.447 --> 02:47:03.048]  One of them said, there's no chance in hell I would eat this.
[02:47:04.128 --> 02:47:08.550]  Another one said, no boycott is needed because there won't even be any sale.
[02:47:09.111 --> 02:47:18.754]  So according to the respondents to the article, not so keen on the cricket burger, but they're going to try and trial it in that grocery supermarket chain.
[02:47:18.794 --> 02:47:20.255]  We'll see what the result is.
[02:47:20.775 --> 02:47:21.255]  Good luck.
[02:47:21.556 --> 02:47:21.936]  Good luck.
[02:47:23.056 --> 02:47:27.118]  Meanwhile, Berkeley tells students not to post racist coronavirus memes.
[02:47:28.470 --> 02:47:38.758]  This is out of the University of California, Berkeley, that's telling students not to post memes about the coronavirus, asserting that fear of the epidemic is rooted in racism.
[02:47:38.798 --> 02:47:51.609]  It's not rooted in the fact that 70,000 people, based on the Chinese Communist Party's official numbers, which is probably way underestimating it, or straight up lying about it, it's not based on that.
[02:47:51.629 --> 02:47:55.192]  It's not based on the fact that 2,000 people have already died from the coronavirus.
[02:47:55.272 --> 02:47:55.452]  No.
[02:47:56.052 --> 02:47:57.874]  According to Berkeley academics,
[02:47:58.587 --> 02:48:07.389]  Fears about the coronavirus are based on, quote, an assumption that the West, particularly Anglo-American Christians, should dominate the world.
[02:48:08.109 --> 02:48:13.230]  So if you don't want to catch the coronavirus, basically you're a white supremacist.
[02:48:13.690 --> 02:48:27.333]  And the biggest problem with all this, as the WHO itself has suggested in now two separate press releases, is not the spread, the potential global pandemic nature of the coronavirus.
[02:48:27.933 --> 02:48:28.053]  It's
[02:48:29.025 --> 02:48:31.027]  Social media memes and gifs.
[02:48:31.367 --> 02:48:38.874]  Now, Berkeley is telling students if they post social media memes and gifs, that will only provoke more racism.
[02:48:39.655 --> 02:48:45.500]  So again, spread of coronavirus, protecting yourself, washing your hands, preventing a global pandemic.
[02:48:46.471 --> 02:48:47.813]  That might be somewhat important.
[02:48:48.194 --> 02:48:56.247]  What is more important is not offending somebody and hurting their feelings with those dastardly bat soup memes.
[02:48:56.748 --> 02:48:57.849]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[02:48:57.890 --> 02:48:59.172]  War Room is coming up next.
[02:48:59.192 --> 02:49:00.454]  Breaking news at Summit.News.
[02:49:12.335 --> 02:49:16.097]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:49:16.638 --> 02:49:19.860]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.

[02:49:26.944 --> 02:49:28.605]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:49:29.185 --> 02:49:30.647]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:49:31.267 --> 02:49:36.372]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:49:36.732 --> 02:49:44.680]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:51.606]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:49:51.926 --> 02:49:54.749]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:50:02.751 --> 02:50:06.073]  By the way, when you see his shows on RT, BBC, Al Jazeera.
[02:50:06.173 --> 02:50:06.413]  Yeah.
[02:50:06.554 --> 02:50:07.514]  It's so professional.
[02:50:07.854 --> 02:50:08.335]  Totally.
[02:50:08.515 --> 02:50:11.137]  He comes on the show to misbehave.
[02:50:11.717 --> 02:50:12.998]  By the way, we were having... Because it's weird.
[02:50:13.038 --> 02:50:13.518]  It's Austin.
[02:50:13.538 --> 02:50:14.159]  Keep it weird.
[02:50:14.599 --> 02:50:15.740]  Keep it weird, Austin.
[02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:17.581]  That's the brand from Austin.
[02:50:18.101 --> 02:50:18.702]  What's going on?
[02:50:19.162 --> 02:50:21.403]  Oh, don't bring out the .50 caliber again.
[02:50:21.444 --> 02:50:22.804]  No, don't do it.
[02:50:23.325 --> 02:50:27.868]  I was just trying to... Just because you didn't buy Bitcoin at a dollar.
[02:50:28.128 --> 02:50:29.029]  Don't blame me.
[02:50:29.409 --> 02:50:32.391]  I begged you to buy Bitcoin at a dollar and you said no.
[02:50:33.071 --> 02:50:35.854]  I have the guns, and you don't have anything.
[02:50:35.914 --> 02:50:41.019]  I have Super Silver Toothpaste, which is as powerful as all your weaponry in fighting the battle against cavities.
[02:50:41.079 --> 02:50:43.821]  Super Silver Toothpaste, and it looks really cool.
[02:50:44.162 --> 02:50:49.446]  And if you use it, a lot of women will stop you on the street and say, hi, I'd like to marry you.
[02:50:49.467 --> 02:50:51.909]  Super Silver Toothpaste, it's for winners.

[02:50:59.234 --> 02:51:01.095]  You're pointing those Nerf guns at my child.
[02:51:01.115 --> 02:51:03.537]  You know what that means?
[02:51:04.557 --> 02:51:05.518]  One wrong move, buddy.
[02:51:05.658 --> 02:51:06.258]  One wrong move.
[02:51:07.139 --> 02:51:07.419]  Wow.
[02:51:07.799 --> 02:51:08.339]  That's power.
[02:51:08.600 --> 02:51:08.900]  See that?
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:10.621]  That is power.
[02:51:11.741 --> 02:51:12.021]  See that?
[02:51:12.262 --> 02:51:12.942]  That's awesome.
[02:51:12.982 --> 02:51:13.522]  Right in the lens.
[02:51:13.702 --> 02:51:14.423]  One wrong move.
[02:51:15.367 --> 02:51:16.268]  Ultimate fish oil.
[02:51:16.288 --> 02:51:17.410]  You actually live in America.
[02:51:17.430 --> 02:51:19.472]  The citizens have guns as well as the government.
[02:51:19.492 --> 02:51:20.714]  Reduce your cholesterol levels.
[02:51:20.734 --> 02:51:21.094]  There you go.
[02:51:21.454 --> 02:51:21.835]  Quickly.
[02:51:22.516 --> 02:51:23.497]  And that's what you need, isn't it?
[02:51:23.657 --> 02:51:24.398]  Super fish oil.
[02:51:24.578 --> 02:51:29.784]  Why sit down to a plate of 50 pounds of cod when you can just pop one of these tablets and get the same benefit?
[02:51:30.325 --> 02:51:31.186]  Ultimate fish oil.
[02:51:31.266 --> 02:51:34.608]  Rachel Maddow is Nancy Pelosi's intimate partner.
[02:51:34.848 --> 02:51:39.852]  And when they get down with some ultimate fish oil, it's a beautiful thing.
[02:51:39.872 --> 02:51:42.454]  And not even AOC can stay away from that union.
[02:51:42.474 --> 02:51:44.675]  It's a threesome of socialism.
[02:51:44.895 --> 02:51:45.816]  And it funds her operation.
[02:51:45.836 --> 02:51:48.158]  You know, I just want to say that, you know... Stop it!
[02:51:48.238 --> 02:51:51.960]  This fish oil product is great, but when I was a kid, you know, we just sniffed blue.
[02:51:52.201 --> 02:51:54.222]  You know, that was 15 cents.
[02:51:54.322 --> 02:51:55.283]  And look what it did to you.
[02:51:55.403 --> 02:51:56.424]  I mean, and it worked, right?
[02:51:56.464 --> 02:51:58.085]  I mean, I didn't have any ill effects.
[02:52:05.447 --> 02:52:11.012]  Does your shampoo leave your scalp itchy and your hair dry and frizzy?
[02:52:12.072 --> 02:52:16.936]  Introducing Emrix Essentials Natural Herbal Shampoo.

[02:53:00.580 --> 02:53:01.320]  Real stuff, man.
[02:53:01.361 --> 02:53:02.501]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[02:53:02.521 --> 02:53:07.965]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[02:53:07.985 --> 02:53:10.186]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[02:53:10.866 --> 02:53:12.367]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[02:53:12.567 --> 02:53:15.789]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[02:53:15.809 --> 02:53:19.592]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[02:53:19.972 --> 02:53:20.913]  Twenty different stickers.
[02:53:21.454 --> 02:53:22.675]  Impeach the Democrats.
[02:53:23.075 --> 02:53:24.116]  Save the Second Amendment.
[02:53:24.136 --> 02:53:25.178]  Defend the First Amendment.
[02:53:25.238 --> 02:53:26.199]  Infowars.com.
[02:53:26.559 --> 02:53:27.920]  And it looks like duct tape.
[02:53:27.981 --> 02:53:28.721]  It's just a regular sticker.
[02:53:28.741 --> 02:53:29.562]  You put it over your mouth.
[02:53:29.762 --> 02:53:30.904]  You go to a Trump rally.
[02:53:31.064 --> 02:53:33.526]  And you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[02:53:33.546 --> 02:53:34.708]  People say, why are you doing this?
[02:53:35.088 --> 02:53:35.609]  What's happening?
[02:53:35.629 --> 02:53:37.130]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[02:53:37.150 --> 02:53:39.332]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[02:53:39.392 --> 02:53:41.254]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think.
[02:53:41.274 --> 02:53:42.516]  Because I've not launched this yet.
[02:53:42.756 --> 02:53:43.117]  Brilliant.
[02:53:43.537 --> 02:53:50.348]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[02:53:50.628 --> 02:53:53.392]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[02:53:53.593 --> 02:53:55.796]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[02:53:56.397 --> 02:53:56.757]  Silence.
