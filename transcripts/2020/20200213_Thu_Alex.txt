[00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:30.322]  The Trump Justice Department that abandons the rule of law to give sweetheart deals to criminals who commit their crimes on behalf of Donald Trump.
[00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:33.067]  And yes, Roger Stone, I'm looking at you.
[00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:42.203]  That's Elizabeth Warren failing and bitter in New Hampshire, and like so many on the left, howling for Roger Stone to die in prison.
[00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:49.011]  A 67-year-old man with no criminal record caught up in the Russia hoax, farce.
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.182]  Caught up in an investigation that proved to be fruitless.
[00:00:54.043 --> 00:00:56.825]  He's looking at nine years behind bars.
[00:00:57.626 --> 00:01:00.028]  You know what the average rapist does in this country?
[00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:00.889]  We checked today.
[00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.669]  Four years.
[00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:03.371]  You know what the average armed robber gets?
[00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:04.331]  Three years.
[00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:06.974]  The average thug who violently assaults somebody?
[00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:08.475]  Less than a year and a half.
[00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:13.139]  But the left, CNN as well, demanding that Roger Stone die in prison.
[00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.511]  This man needs a pardon.
[00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.053]  This is a pure political hit.
[00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:22.918]  Roger Stone is facing prison because he is a high-profile Donald Trump supporter.
[00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.099]  It's that simple.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.900]  You want proof?
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.561]  Here it is.
[00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.624]  John Brennan and James Clapper will sleep at home tonight.
[00:01:29.044 --> 00:01:34.049]  Both have been caught lying under oath on camera about matters of national importance.
[00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.591]  And yet, neither's in jail.
[00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:36.972]  Neither's been indicted.
[00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:38.233]  Neither ever will be.
[00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:43.623]  The Stone case, by contrast, was transparently political from day one.
[00:01:44.183 --> 00:01:48.245]  The lead prosecutor, Andrew Weissman, is now literally an MSNBC contributor.
[00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:59.170]  The judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, is an out-of-control Democratic partisan who purely out of spite stripped Roger Stone of his First Amendment rights and prevented him from making a living.
[00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:00.691]  Coming on this show, for example.
[00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:01.812]  Speaking it all in public.
[00:02:02.532 --> 00:02:08.399]  Now Stone and his wife, who is 71 years old and deaf, have lost their home because of this.
[00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.340]  They have no insurance.
[00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:10.562]  They're utterly broke.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.581]  The whole thing is shocking, and it's disgusting.
[00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:18.081]  It's a farce that discredits the entire American justice system.
[00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:20.042]  The President seems to understand that.
[00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.483]  Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice, he tweeted recently.
[00:02:24.303 --> 00:02:25.823]  He's right, on a couple of levels.
[00:02:26.403 --> 00:02:28.564]  What's happening to Roger Stone is totally wrong.
[00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:30.804]  It's immoral, and we should not allow it in this country.
[00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:33.305]  But politically, it has significance too.
[00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:41.429]  Stone's prosecution was designed in part to confirm the fantasies that Democrats have constructed to explain the outcome of the 2016 election.
[00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:43.990]  His conviction helps their case.
[00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.714]  In other words, if the Russia collusion story was a hoax, and of course it most certainly was a hoax, then why is Roger Stone going to prison for his role in it?
[00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:59.778]  If Roger Stone serves even a single day behind bars, the Russia lie will be validated as true.
[00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.220]  Stone's imprisonment will be prima facie evidence.
[00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:04.977]  In the view of Democrats.
[00:03:05.757 --> 00:03:07.818]  So at this point, there's really only one solution.
[00:03:08.198 --> 00:03:13.181]  The President must pardon Roger Stone or commute his sentence before he goes to jail.
[00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.522]  Democrats will howl if he does that.
[00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:16.703]  Well, they're howling anyway.
[00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:17.603]  They howl every day.
[00:03:17.903 --> 00:03:21.825]  Chuck Schumer is now yelping about yet another investigation into Roger Stone.
[00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:23.066]  Russiagate too!
[00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:32.991]  In one entirely constitutional act, the President could save Roger Stone's life, vindicate himself, and end this nonsense forever.
[00:03:34.272 --> 00:03:36.513]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:40.615]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:44.476]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[00:03:45.116 --> 00:03:49.018]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.022]  We brought in a non-Globalist paid actor and did a blind taste test between the mac and cheese from Storable Foods at Infowarsstore.com and one of America's leading brands.
[00:04:01.303 --> 00:04:02.063]  These are the results.
[00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:07.547]  Now go ahead and try the first macaroni and cheese to your right.
[00:04:07.587 --> 00:04:08.907]  It literally smells like nothing.
[00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:15.828]  What were your first thoughts?
[00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:19.229]  Typical.
[00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:29.051]  Takes me back to when the babysitter doesn't quite know how to make it like your mom makes it, so it's just not... Let's move on to the one on your left.
[00:04:30.922 --> 00:04:32.463]  See, this one actually smells like cheese.
[00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:33.564]  Alright.
[00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:34.725]  Do I have any on my fork here?
[00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:41.651]  Go buy your storable food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:42.632]  It's episode 6!
[00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:02.017]  Return of the Republic.
[00:05:02.957 --> 00:05:11.042]  Here we are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, February 13th, 2020 global transmission.
[00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:17.025]  And to say the wheels have come off the deep state's criminal operations is an understatement.
[00:05:17.045 --> 00:05:19.947]  We are living in incredibly spectacular times.
[00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:31.875]  The attempt to put Roger Stone wrongfully in prison was supposed to be a cherry on top of the Trump impeachment and removal for the original Russiagate hoax.
[00:05:32.056 --> 00:05:32.796]  That failed.
[00:05:33.597 --> 00:05:45.225]  So the New York Times, a few months ago, when he was wrongfully convicted by an admitted kangaroo court of Democrat Party operatives who bragged publicly that they were going to lynch him during the trial and after,
[00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:54.772]  Well now it's a cherry on top showing what a giant fraud they are and is causing massive outrage across not just the U.S.
[00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:55.373]  but the world.
[00:05:55.793 --> 00:06:07.195]  No one is buying this miscarriage of justice and I predict that within two weeks Roger Stum will be back co-hosting this broadcast and the War Room.
[00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:14.016]  And the silencing of this American patriot who was punished for helping advise President Trump
[00:06:15.006 --> 00:06:19.668]  Getting President Trump to want to run for office, making President Trump believe he could win.
[00:06:21.008 --> 00:06:24.329]  President Trump would not be President if it wasn't for Roger Stone.
[00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.331]  He wouldn't be President if it wasn't for Matt Drudge.
[00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:32.292]  He wouldn't be President if it wasn't for WikiLeaks.
[00:06:33.652 --> 00:06:38.694]  And if the President doesn't pardon Stone, he's insane.
[00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:43.536]  Word is, though, as I told you back on Friday and as I said on Monday and Tuesday,
[00:06:44.628 --> 00:06:53.313]  And yesterday, on Wednesday, Trump is currently preparing to pardon Roger Stone.
[00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:58.215]  And CNN and MSNBC are up there spinning, going, he can't do that.
[00:06:58.295 --> 00:06:59.676]  That's obstruction of justice.
[00:07:00.176 --> 00:07:05.079]  No, that's why you have an executive branch that's co-equal to the legislative and the judicial.
[00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:10.452]  So that when those get out of control, it could be a check on the other, and vice versa.
[00:07:10.492 --> 00:07:15.459]  It's called separation of powers, and it's part of our federal system.
[00:07:16.988 --> 00:07:19.790]  When you think about federal system, it's not a worship of the federal government.
[00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:28.274]  The federalist system actually divides power between the states and the federal government and then divides the state, local and federal government into three parts each.
[00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:37.580]  Between the three as well, so it's divided six different ways so that you don't get a man on a white horse.
[00:07:39.272 --> 00:07:39.972]  A.K.A.
[00:07:40.032 --> 00:07:42.353]  Napoleon Bonaparte or Adolf Hitler.
[00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:48.175]  Everything was done to restrain the hands of tyrants.
[00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:55.817]  And so it is a very, very exciting time, ladies and gentlemen, to be alive.
[00:07:56.397 --> 00:08:00.979]  But make no mistake, the deep state is going to strike back and this
[00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:17.688]  Coronavirus is already hurting the global economy, and I expect to see it continue to do so, and that's one of the Achilles heel that are out there that could derail some of this exploding nationalist patriot movement.
[00:08:18.628 --> 00:08:31.716]  The other thing that could happen is, those of us that have ignited the populist movement worldwide, we have to understand that
[00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:50.300]  We have to hold our populist leaders and ourselves to task and make sure that these hard-earned gains continue on and that the larger challenges we face of the big tech surveillance grid and the authoritarianism of communist China is dealt with.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:58.962]  Now, I do want to go to phone calls starting in the next segment to talk about the economy, to talk about the coronavirus, to talk about
[00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:07.255]  Roger Stone, and the whole Russiagate hoax imploding, and the fact that Tucker Carlson is absolutely right.
[00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:23.405]  Trump must pardon Stone because Stone is innocent, and Stone was railroaded, and the jurors, it turned out, were high-level Democratic Party operatives who were bragging about how they were going to send him to prison for the rest of his life.
[00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:27.128]  And this judge is another dangerous tyrant.
[00:09:28.226 --> 00:09:39.174]  And all of them need to be roundly repudiated, and this judge needs to be removed from the bench for judicial misconduct if there ever was.
[00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:43.877]  Remember just a few months ago, the Washington Post headline, U.S.
[00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:56.686]  prosecutors call for Alex Jones' arrest for outing a juror's identity under dozens of Supreme Court rulings and other federal rulings.
[00:09:57.671 --> 00:10:02.993]  It is not just your right, but your duty to show conflicts of interest in jurors.
[00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:09.316]  And jurors are public in everything but very rare mafia trials.
[00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:12.797]  But that shows who the left is.
[00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:14.938]  They want to arrest everyone.
[00:10:14.978 --> 00:10:17.599]  So I'm going to tell the left and the authoritarians, you're dangerous.
[00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:20.400]  America and the world is waking up to you.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.742]  And you can piss up a rope.
[00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:29.731]  I am protected by the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:10:29.831 --> 00:10:47.235]  I am protected by those that fought and died to defend that Bill of Rights and Constitution that doesn't give me rights, but simply points out that the government's job is to defend those rights, not take a wrecking ball to it like this Judge Jackson and others have done.
[00:10:47.255 --> 00:10:51.996]  It's incredible.
[00:10:53.056 --> 00:10:57.197]  Roger Stone, trial juror, was former Dem candidate who hated Trump.
[00:10:58.476 --> 00:10:59.137]  Well, yeah.
[00:10:59.277 --> 00:11:07.363]  I mean, one of them was the wife of a Mueller probe lawyer who ran the Russiagate operation.
[00:11:08.144 --> 00:11:09.385]  That person had to step down.
[00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:16.471]  The judge openly said, no, no, you need to stay on, when Stone's people raised an issue.
[00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:19.753]  And then the judge told the media, you don't say her name!
[00:11:20.214 --> 00:11:23.937]  Piss up a rope, Judge Jackson!
[00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:27.399]  You monster!
[00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.872]  The thing about North Korea is it's powers only inside North Korea.
[00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:35.314]  Same thing with you, lady.
[00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:40.497]  Your illegitimate, out-of-control power grab only goes as far as we put up with.
[00:11:40.798 --> 00:11:45.501]  You are a sniveling witch who will burn in hell!
[00:11:47.542 --> 00:11:51.664]  You're another arrogant, vicious, aggressive judicial tyrant.
[00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:53.906]  And you are
[00:11:54.983 --> 00:11:56.665]  The bane of free nations!
[00:11:56.725 --> 00:11:58.466]  You are a curse on free peoples!
[00:11:58.826 --> 00:12:00.428]  You are not an American!
[00:12:01.169 --> 00:12:04.952]  You are an authoritarian dirtbag witch!
[00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:11.378]  Now try that on for size, you pig-faced monster!
[00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:18.244]  Americans need to stop bowing down to people that are dishonorable!
[00:12:21.172 --> 00:12:42.461]  The left has whipped themselves up into a piranha-like frenzy to run around and assault and attack and shoot people and drive cars into us and sue everybody and bear false witness and say all these honorable judges, like Kavanaugh, are rapists with no proof.
[00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:44.341]  It's disgusting!
[00:12:45.822 --> 00:12:49.724]  And people are sick and tired of it.
[00:12:51.857 --> 00:12:53.038]  They see through your crap.
[00:12:53.158 --> 00:12:57.660]  And this isn't the type of awakening where it just kind of we wake up for a while and it goes away.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.721]  It's going to get more intense.
[00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:00.282]  It's going to get deeper.
[00:13:00.862 --> 00:13:02.843]  It's going to absolutely explode.
[00:13:04.004 --> 00:13:06.165]  And it's going to be a rocky road, folks.
[00:13:06.225 --> 00:13:10.948]  But I'm here to tell you, humanity's up to the challenge with God's help of all the things we face.
[00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:16.391]  And this is the beginning of the end of these technocrats and the things they're involved in.
[00:13:16.812 --> 00:13:20.094]  But it is important to stand up to these monsters.
[00:13:21.087 --> 00:13:26.371]  So I predict that Roger Stone will be on this show, this broadcast, within two weeks.
[00:13:27.152 --> 00:13:33.897]  The sentencing is next week, on the 20th, and we're going to have reporters there covering and reporters at CPAC.
[00:13:34.278 --> 00:13:36.199]  Hell, this is so important, there's a good chance I'm going to go.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.202]  You know, CPAC is so cowardly.
[00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:46.810]  The Republican bluebloods that still control it, that people like Roger Stone aren't even welcome there.
[00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.451]  Or people like myself that actually got Trump elected.
[00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:51.532]  That shows you what Trump's up against, though.
[00:13:52.073 --> 00:13:52.573]  Doesn't matter.
[00:13:52.773 --> 00:13:55.475]  If I show up at CSPAC, we'll just totally steal the show and take the whole thing over.
[00:13:55.795 --> 00:13:56.675]  But you know what?
[00:13:56.815 --> 00:13:58.817]  I don't need to do that, so I just may not do it.
[00:13:59.597 --> 00:14:01.878]  But, I'm really thinking about it.
[00:14:02.538 --> 00:14:03.678]  I'm really thinking about it.
[00:14:03.698 --> 00:14:07.800]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:13.122]  First time callers, give you a shot again.
[00:14:13.382 --> 00:14:15.062]  We'd love to hear from you on the other side.
[00:14:15.423 --> 00:14:24.106]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com, and the site that's exploding thanks to you spreading the word, Band.Video.
[00:14:24.466 --> 00:14:24.866]  Woo!
[00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:27.527]  America is rising!
[00:14:29.184 --> 00:14:34.488]  I'm going to lay out something right now that is the absolute, total key to victory.
[00:14:35.549 --> 00:14:37.331]  It's very simple, it's hiding in plain view.
[00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:40.993]  Most of you will say, yeah, Alex, we understand that.
[00:14:41.074 --> 00:14:45.037]  But do you consciously put that into action?
[00:14:47.278 --> 00:14:48.019]  Are you aware of it?
[00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:56.426]  You see, everything Hollywood does, everything the social engineers do, is about
[00:14:57.918 --> 00:15:04.225]  Making us bow to them, making us cow to them, making us feel guilty like we're not good people and they're the priest.
[00:15:04.886 --> 00:15:06.668]  They're the way to God.
[00:15:06.848 --> 00:15:08.230]  They will give us absolution.
[00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.431]  They will tell us how to talk.
[00:15:09.712 --> 00:15:10.813]  They will tell us how to live.
[00:15:11.093 --> 00:15:13.276]  They will tell us who to love and who to hate.
[00:15:16.226 --> 00:15:19.167]  And they lie to us, and they turn us against each other.
[00:15:19.747 --> 00:15:29.990]  And everything they do is about dishonor, and about disruption, and about devolving the society into ruins in their own admissions.
[00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:44.455]  And so, when President Trump pardons Roger Stone, he's not just showing he has the power and repudiating their lies, he's showing he's not scared of them when they say, you're a criminal because you let this person out of jail.
[00:15:47.236 --> 00:15:55.882]  And Trump is turning the corner of absolutely not caring what these criminals say or do because he has right action.
[00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:58.164]  He's following the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:15:58.444 --> 00:15:59.465]  He is the president.
[00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:04.389]  And his only failing is he's not gone after these people strong enough.
[00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:10.633]  But if the action we've seen the last four days, and the acceleration of the action,
[00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:18.718]  Continues, it's going to be devastating within just seven days to two weeks.
[00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:25.624]  It's like watching a dragster and the light flashes green.
[00:16:26.997 --> 00:16:31.338]  And they hit that accelerator, and just all of a sudden, boom, it's down the road.
[00:16:32.018 --> 00:16:39.560]  We're in that first half second right now, and I mean, the dragsters finally just... I'm like, yeah!
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.421]  You can smell the fuel, fire shooting out the sides.
[00:16:42.581 --> 00:16:44.841]  I mean, wow, looks like a good run.
[00:16:45.502 --> 00:16:46.762]  But sometimes the dragsters...
[00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:51.655]  Goes off to an angle and blows up.
[00:16:51.955 --> 00:16:54.616]  So, this is a dangerous situation.
[00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:59.717]  And you know what they say in Pulp Fiction, what the wolf says, let's not start celebrating just quite yet.
[00:17:01.037 --> 00:17:14.800]  But, the left had their giant con game, their confidence act, their arrogance, and the crimes they've been committing and the things they've been doing have just been staggering that they got away with them.
[00:17:16.141 --> 00:17:17.042]  Did they get away with it?
[00:17:17.842 --> 00:17:18.983]  In the court of public opinion.
[00:17:19.723 --> 00:17:25.106]  I have a lot of family that are yellow dog Democrat types.
[00:17:26.807 --> 00:17:28.908]  Mainly Republicans in my family, but there's Democrats.
[00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.671]  None of them are Democrats now.
[00:17:34.111 --> 00:17:37.413]  They all hate the Democratic Party and so the Democratic Party is dead.
[00:17:37.433 --> 00:17:40.435]  And that they are completely through with it forever.
[00:17:41.196 --> 00:17:44.918]  And they say this openly in front of their other liberal friends who then
[00:17:46.656 --> 00:17:46.996]  Agreed.
[00:17:48.938 --> 00:17:51.860]  The Democratic Party is done.
[00:17:53.621 --> 00:17:54.581]  If we want it to be.
[00:17:55.162 --> 00:18:15.396]  And it's emblematic that Biden and Pelosi and other creatures like Maxine Waters and Dianne Feinstein look and behave like a dead spider you find in the corner behind the door
[00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.292]  In the spring that froze to death.
[00:18:19.073 --> 00:18:21.115]  They're dead spiders, politically.
[00:18:22.456 --> 00:18:24.678]  And they're a joke!
[00:18:24.998 --> 00:18:26.380]  And their followers are a joke!
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.801]  But then how are they getting elected?
[00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:28.922]  Election fraud.
[00:18:30.984 --> 00:18:40.214]  The Democrats want a admitted communist who never got a paycheck till he was 40 from a college.
[00:18:42.159 --> 00:18:50.524]  Who got married and had a honeymoon in the old Soviet Union and reportedly visited gulags and thinks they're great.
[00:18:53.745 --> 00:19:02.830]  And who swindles... I mean, he didn't just personally steal $5 million from that university his wife took over and bankrupted in four years.
[00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:10.675]  He hired over 50 people in his family and they all swindled some estimates are over $30 million out of it in four years.
[00:19:11.573 --> 00:19:17.817]  I mean, you want somebody to bankrupt this country, you want somebody to suck your ass dry, he will do it.
[00:19:18.878 --> 00:19:21.239]  If you give him a problem, he'll line you up and have your ass shot.
[00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:26.862]  Because he's Bernie Sanders, the anointed king that we've all got to bow down to.
[00:19:30.225 --> 00:19:36.188]  And the buffoons that follow him and the millennials with their thousand dollar smartphones, their $200 skinny jeans.
[00:19:40.208 --> 00:19:42.910]  Half of them in major polls identify as communist.
[00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:46.113]  That's a clear and present danger.
[00:19:47.294 --> 00:20:01.546]  And so, we need to stop kissing their asses, and stop bowing to all their political correctness, and stop trying to show that we're hip, and we're woke, and we're down with them, because if you do that, this country's done.
[00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:04.108]  We need leadership in their face.
[00:20:08.157 --> 00:20:21.566]  And to let these people know what losers and jokes they are, not in a mean way, but a way to say, hey, Jack, you're not as cool as you think you are with all that student debt and spouting all your communist crap.
[00:20:23.247 --> 00:20:26.289]  You know, I see videos every day like the one I'm about to play.
[00:20:27.469 --> 00:20:32.833]  And I don't play them on air because after I've already watched them once, I'm kind of a selfish person.
[00:20:33.673 --> 00:20:34.554]  I don't want to see it again.
[00:20:35.876 --> 00:20:48.052]  So this video I'm about to play is emblematic of hundreds I've seen, hundreds I know you've seen, of universities all over in Missouri and in Ohio.
[00:20:48.112 --> 00:20:50.135]  It's not just in California and New York and places.
[00:20:51.647 --> 00:21:05.898]  Where you'll have a little white 18-year-old freshman, 19-year-old wearing a Run-DMC retro shirt or something, and weird trendy black girls walk over, it's always girls, and start punching them in the face.
[00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:09.380]  Everybody laughs and agrees they're white, they deserve to be attacked.
[00:21:13.383 --> 00:21:16.926]  But think about what the Democrats have become.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:22.862]  That they're self-segregating everywhere and saying whites are inherently bad.
[00:21:22.882 --> 00:21:26.564]  That's Hitlerian race science, but just turn the other way.
[00:21:27.424 --> 00:21:30.706]  And then there's this idea, well, white people have done bad things, so you deserve it.
[00:21:31.006 --> 00:21:34.668]  Really, some other white dude did something 200 years ago, so I'm bad?
[00:21:35.488 --> 00:21:38.570]  If my father committed crimes and went to prison, I'm not to blame.
[00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.311]  The idea of
[00:21:41.854 --> 00:21:52.557]  Blood libel, blood, blood debt, that because somebody, somewhere, someplace did something that looks a little like you, you're guilty.
[00:21:52.637 --> 00:21:56.198]  That's not just tyranny, that's mental illness, and that's crazy.
[00:21:56.358 --> 00:21:57.498]  When we come back, I'm going to play.
[00:21:57.698 --> 00:22:04.640]  UVA says Multicultural Student Center is open to all races after too many white people rant goes viral.
[00:22:05.914 --> 00:22:09.635]  And when you see this, this is what the standard is.
[00:22:09.655 --> 00:22:12.797]  This isn't some aberrant thing that only happens here or there.
[00:22:13.157 --> 00:22:19.159]  This is what's taught at Evergreen College and all over the place, where they just say, no whites are allowed this weekend.
[00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:21.760]  And a professor goes, that's really racist.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.641]  They get fired.
[00:22:23.881 --> 00:22:26.142]  This is the standard that's going on.
[00:22:27.711 --> 00:22:31.875]  Because they're breaking people down to say, fine, I'm evil because I'm white.
[00:22:32.015 --> 00:22:33.476]  Politically, tell me what I'm supposed to do.
[00:22:33.897 --> 00:22:35.838]  And the answer is, literally kiss my boots.
[00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:44.566]  But the black woman up there saying all of this, she's just the puppet spouting the playbook to create massive racism.
[00:22:45.672 --> 00:22:49.475]  She's being told, oh, you're doing this to make people realize how bad they are because they're white.
[00:22:49.575 --> 00:22:55.899]  No, they're doing this, the WikiLeaks says it, because they want everyone hating each other and divided along race, just like a prison.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.082]  The Democrats know what they're doing, and it's sick.
[00:23:00.663 --> 00:23:03.505]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:23:03.525 --> 00:23:04.686]  I'm about to go to your phone calls.
[00:23:04.726 --> 00:23:07.267]  First-time callers are the first round we're taking, 877-789-2539.
[00:23:07.288 --> 00:23:08.869]  Famous constitutional lawyer, famous criminal lawyer,
[00:23:14.858 --> 00:23:24.425]  Norm Pattis is going to be in studio next hour taking your legal questions and comments on Roger Stone and just the state of the deep state and so much more.
[00:23:29.189 --> 00:23:34.212]  Now getting back to not letting the left intimidate us and dictate to us.
[00:23:36.654 --> 00:23:44.220]  The left pushes a religious style ideology that the West is inherently bad and the West inherently must go away.
[00:23:45.233 --> 00:23:47.154]  And that white people are inherently bad.
[00:23:47.855 --> 00:24:01.683]  And I see the reports every day, just like you do, out of Europe, out of Sweden, out of Germany, where men will gang-rape a seven-year-old girl, beat her up, and the judge lets them go, and they go, oh, that's just Islam.
[00:24:02.864 --> 00:24:07.887]  Or someone hand-grenade attacks a fire department for no reason, doesn't even get in trouble.
[00:24:10.028 --> 00:24:12.770]  Sometimes they... I saw a story yesterday where two
[00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:21.294]  Somali migrants went on a spree robbing, stabbing, attacking for days.
[00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:24.916]  And the judges said, you can go free.
[00:24:25.957 --> 00:24:28.879]  It's a religious virtue signal sacrament.
[00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:32.160]  And you say to yourself, why are they doing that?
[00:24:32.301 --> 00:24:35.302]  It's a plan to bring down the civilization.
[00:24:38.364 --> 00:24:42.827]  And so we have to stop being politically correct in any way.
[00:24:44.088 --> 00:24:46.450]  I personally do not hate homosexuals.
[00:24:47.812 --> 00:24:52.316]  But I am not going to use the word gay anymore because that's how it all started.
[00:24:52.456 --> 00:24:54.538]  Oh, just use the word gay.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.702]  Don't hurt people's feelings.
[00:24:58.742 --> 00:25:00.343]  Don't use... heterosexual.
[00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:01.704]  It's a scientific term.
[00:25:04.087 --> 00:25:04.967]  And then once you...
[00:25:06.019 --> 00:25:08.941]  Use the word gay, which just means happy and in a good mood.
[00:25:09.581 --> 00:25:14.424]  Now you see, well, they're telling people all over the United States and Europe, don't say the word mother or father.
[00:25:14.944 --> 00:25:20.727]  Don't have the word woman or man on the side of a bus because somebody might not identify as a man or a woman.
[00:25:21.007 --> 00:25:22.128]  Now those are dirty words.
[00:25:22.368 --> 00:25:27.951]  These people are thought police that want control and it's all run by the Tavistock Institute and MI6.
[00:25:28.871 --> 00:25:31.733]  And left is the CIA and that's all declassified.
[00:25:34.721 --> 00:25:50.487]  By the 50s, the Ford Foundation had taken over the CIA, and it was declassified in the 70s, that they said, we want ugly art, ugly literature, we want to attack the family, because there's no way our system will come in, because the American system's too good, everyone's gonna want to adopt this.
[00:25:50.948 --> 00:25:59.211]  We have to make architecture and culture ugly, and have Hollywood spew anti-American stuff, or everybody's gonna want this freedom.
[00:26:02.056 --> 00:26:02.697]  Think I'm joking?
[00:26:02.717 --> 00:26:06.520]  Just type in CIA paid for ugly art and ugly architecture.
[00:26:07.841 --> 00:26:10.643]  Think about how evil that is!
[00:26:11.704 --> 00:26:20.711]  Of course the left can't compete with Marilyn Monroe and 57 Chevys with food lines in Russia.
[00:26:22.652 --> 00:26:23.893]  But what does Bernie Sanders say?
[00:26:24.794 --> 00:26:28.417]  You pull the video up, he says there's too many types of deodorant.
[00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.892]  There's too many different types of meat.
[00:26:33.193 --> 00:26:34.974]  There's too many different types of clothing.
[00:26:36.495 --> 00:26:38.817]  That that's why there's a problem with the economy.
[00:26:39.337 --> 00:26:42.139]  That is the most perfect inversion of reality I've ever heard.
[00:26:44.061 --> 00:26:49.625]  You can say people that worship consumerism and worship goods are bad because they are.
[00:26:50.105 --> 00:26:52.607]  But having goods makes you secure to take care of your family.
[00:26:53.008 --> 00:26:54.489]  You wouldn't sell out for the goods.
[00:26:56.491 --> 00:27:02.573]  Nice cars, clothes that fit well, good medicine, good schooling, a motorboat, going to play golf.
[00:27:02.793 --> 00:27:04.714]  That's the fruits of freedom.
[00:27:04.814 --> 00:27:05.954]  That's not a bad thing.
[00:27:07.575 --> 00:27:12.016]  But he says there's inequality because we've got 30 different types of deodorant.
[00:27:12.076 --> 00:27:12.736]  Excuse me?
[00:27:15.157 --> 00:27:18.278]  That's a manifestation of how much damn freedom we've got.
[00:27:20.199 --> 00:27:27.002]  We don't need 23 choices of deodorant, 18 choices of sneakers when kids are going hungry.
[00:27:30.623 --> 00:27:36.345]  He wants you to get one pair of shoes a year that you stand in line for from him.
[00:27:37.326 --> 00:27:39.146]  Because he's in charge of that.
[00:27:42.247 --> 00:27:45.749]  And they use these stupid mathematical equations to the millennials going,
[00:27:46.647 --> 00:27:49.268]  There are over 500 billionaires.
[00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:54.710]  One of them has more money than 100 million Americans.
[00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:56.130]  Jeff Bezos.
[00:27:56.811 --> 00:27:58.111]  We need to take his money.
[00:27:59.372 --> 00:28:02.193]  Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos funds all the leftist groups teaching that.
[00:28:03.113 --> 00:28:04.313]  Jeff Bezos isn't worth $160 billion.
[00:28:06.496 --> 00:28:08.397]  His inflated stock is.
[00:28:09.097 --> 00:28:11.639]  He couldn't spend 5% of that on real goods.
[00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:13.419]  It would plunge his stock the minute.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.802]  If Jeff Bezos took 5% of his stock out and sold it, his company would collapse.
[00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:18.662]  It's fiat.
[00:28:18.902 --> 00:28:20.003]  It's not real money.
[00:28:20.883 --> 00:28:22.984]  And Sanders sits there and tells people.
[00:28:24.005 --> 00:28:24.625]  Here's an example.
[00:28:24.665 --> 00:28:29.307]  This company's valued at $200 million by SMU and all.
[00:28:29.667 --> 00:28:31.088]  He's been in the news.
[00:28:31.548 --> 00:28:34.470]  There's not $2 million in cash around here.
[00:28:36.072 --> 00:28:37.433]  What, these cameras, all this?
[00:28:37.613 --> 00:28:38.414]  What does that even mean?
[00:28:38.734 --> 00:28:39.714]  It's BS!
[00:28:40.035 --> 00:28:41.856]  I'm not worth $200 million.
[00:28:42.096 --> 00:28:43.017]  They say I am!
[00:28:43.597 --> 00:28:44.377]  BS!
[00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:45.358]  BS!
[00:28:45.578 --> 00:28:46.319]  BS!
[00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.319]  BS!
[00:28:49.361 --> 00:28:51.622]  I don't have $2 million in cash!
[00:28:52.302 --> 00:28:55.665]  And by the way, Bernie Sanders would say, give me that money!
[00:28:56.265 --> 00:28:58.887]  I need that money to buy more product and pay my employees!
[00:28:59.567 --> 00:29:00.108]  See, see how...
[00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:03.224]  Well, there's too much deodorant!
[00:29:04.565 --> 00:29:09.429]  And you'd think that would come out of somebody with a 70 IQ, wearing a football helmet, but it doesn't.
[00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:15.294]  It comes out of this piece of crap, and so he's got bozo clown hair like Einstein.
[00:29:15.675 --> 00:29:17.396]  Oh, you've got bozo hair!
[00:29:17.717 --> 00:29:19.798]  Let me bow down to you right now!
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.662]  What new BS is going to flow out of your mouth, please?
[00:29:24.202 --> 00:29:27.966]  Please tell me right now what new loads of crap are about to come out of your mouth.
[00:29:31.545 --> 00:29:36.649]  It takes capitalism and investment to build things and to have employees and to build infrastructure.
[00:29:36.749 --> 00:29:38.310]  That's why capitalism works.
[00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:50.499]  You go to any communist or socialist TV or radio studio, there's nothing there, and there's all this big grant money coming in, but no one knows where it goes, because the people on top keep it all!
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:30:00.246]  But you come into a free market facility, there's equipment and people driving nice cars who have insurance, because that's how capitalism works!
[00:30:02.366 --> 00:30:05.267]  Builds up everybody that actually wants to work.
[00:30:06.808 --> 00:30:08.048]  But I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:30:08.489 --> 00:30:11.010]  I said I'd take your phone calls, we're gonna go to break, come right back to them.
[00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:18.013]  And I said I'd play these clips, but you notice I haven't played them because it's so disgusting and it's so sickening to watch it.
[00:30:20.334 --> 00:30:30.258]  You have this authoritarian monster woman who's saying the script of, we need white people to leave the new diversity
[00:30:32.984 --> 00:30:35.725]  Well, that's territorialism.
[00:30:36.065 --> 00:30:41.946]  And look, if you go to Africa, the first thing you're going to learn is tribalism.
[00:30:42.246 --> 00:30:44.066]  Just like it's been everywhere around the world as well.
[00:30:45.207 --> 00:30:47.127]  And if you're not in the right tribe, you're dead.
[00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:52.468]  So then we take this lady and go, oh, you're the paragon of all answers.
[00:30:53.028 --> 00:30:56.269]  She just shows up and says, I'm taking over your college.
[00:30:56.429 --> 00:30:57.089]  Get the hell out.
[00:31:01.892 --> 00:31:04.353]  Because that's what the left has programmed her to do.
[00:31:04.734 --> 00:31:06.875]  That's what the left is, is a takeover.
[00:31:07.275 --> 00:31:11.638]  And the left finally went, if people won't accept communism, we'll just give them racism.
[00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:20.203]  Instead of an ethos of, we all have the Bill of Rights and Constitution, we're Americans, we're proud of that heritage, we're unified in our own success together.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.081]  No, they go, we'll just give people race.
[00:31:25.002 --> 00:31:28.905]  And it devolves right back to that and attacks the Christian ethos.
[00:31:29.165 --> 00:31:32.968]  That's the only chance we've got to not blow ourselves up in the planning process.
[00:31:33.929 --> 00:31:35.990]  So let's go out to break with University of Virginia.
[00:31:36.411 --> 00:31:40.173]  This is what's being talked there with this woman saying, get out of here if you're white.
[00:31:40.213 --> 00:31:40.594]  Here it is.
[00:31:42.675 --> 00:31:44.517]  Public service announcement.
[00:31:45.506 --> 00:31:46.446]  Excuse me!
[00:31:46.847 --> 00:31:53.630]  If y'all didn't know, this is the MSC, and frankly, there's just too many white people in here, and this is a space for people of color.
[00:31:53.910 --> 00:32:01.913]  So just be really cognizant of the space that you're taking up, because it does make some of us POCs uncomfortable when we see too many white people in here.
[00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:09.096]  It's only been open for four days, and frankly, there's the whole university for a lot of y'all to be at, and there's very few spaces for us.
[00:32:09.697 --> 00:32:10.677]  So keep that in mind.
[00:32:11.077 --> 00:32:11.497]  Thank you.
[00:32:12.058 --> 00:32:12.938]  Keep that in mind.
[00:32:15.842 --> 00:32:20.044]  Imagine the KKK showed up and said, hey, too many black people, get the hell out of here.
[00:32:20.084 --> 00:32:21.104]  We'd send the Marines in.
[00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:23.165]  But see, oh, it's a black lady.
[00:32:23.205 --> 00:32:24.186]  We've got to do what she says.
[00:32:24.246 --> 00:32:27.307]  This is all tyranny, testing to see what we'll put up with.
[00:32:27.347 --> 00:32:30.188]  Like, you know, get out here, kiss my boots, you evil white devil.
[00:32:31.089 --> 00:32:38.232]  So imagine the total betrayal of the Christian idea of judging people on the character and content of their deeds.
[00:32:40.232 --> 00:32:45.577]  And the total overturning of the common sense that Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:32:45.757 --> 00:32:50.060]  promoted, and the absolute race-baiting being taught by the left.
[00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:51.281]  This is all they've got.
[00:32:52.442 --> 00:33:04.312]  This is their rearguard action, is to create racial division in this country, and the answer is not groveling to the left when they spew their anti-white garbage, but getting in their face.
[00:33:04.352 --> 00:33:07.955]  That's why I support the It's Okay to be White movement.
[00:33:07.995 --> 00:33:08.335]  In fact,
[00:33:09.212 --> 00:33:11.473]  When I went out and hung up posters in Austin, they ignored it.
[00:33:11.593 --> 00:33:13.333]  I went out and said it's great to be white.
[00:33:14.214 --> 00:33:18.815]  But under it, it said it's great to be black, it's great to be brown, it's great to be human.
[00:33:21.536 --> 00:33:32.739]  So, I tried to hire an airplane to fly around there in the DNC saying it's okay to be white.
[00:33:32.939 --> 00:33:34.820]  No one would even do it.
[00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:40.770]  That's how beaten over the head we've gotten.
[00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.831]  So, folks, if people want to live on their knees, let's just do it right now.
[00:33:47.412 --> 00:33:48.872]  Of course it's okay to be white.
[00:33:49.473 --> 00:33:50.033]  It's great.
[00:33:50.533 --> 00:33:51.413]  It's great to be alive.
[00:33:51.453 --> 00:33:52.214]  It's great to be human.
[00:33:52.554 --> 00:33:56.175]  And we should realize how sick this has gotten.
[00:33:56.975 --> 00:34:01.717]  White liberals apologize for slavery by kissing boots of black power group members.
[00:34:01.817 --> 00:34:02.837]  What the hell?
[00:34:03.936 --> 00:34:06.718]  And again, if America's so bad, why are Africans trying to get in here so much?
[00:34:07.339 --> 00:34:09.641]  Just stop hating on America.
[00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:10.781]  Stop hating on the West.
[00:34:11.202 --> 00:34:17.367]  And stop spewing bizarre, race-based garbage, you... I mean, I will say it.
[00:34:17.467 --> 00:34:18.848]  White people kind of are the problem.
[00:34:19.148 --> 00:34:30.137]  It's white leftists pushing all of this crap and legitimizing and defending the black Israelites when they were messing with the Covington kids, saying, we're gonna kill you, we're gonna do this and that.
[00:34:30.457 --> 00:34:31.438]  And the media defended it!
[00:34:35.549 --> 00:34:39.352]  You know, the black Israelites are just like Antifa or the KKK or any other thug group.
[00:34:40.774 --> 00:34:42.876]  Because I've been around them, I've had them smart off to me.
[00:34:43.536 --> 00:34:45.118]  I'll bust you right upside your head.
[00:34:45.418 --> 00:34:51.623]  And all of a sudden, they're not so tough anymore once they run into somebody that isn't going to sit there and hear their BS.
[00:34:55.467 --> 00:34:58.469]  But when there's little kids, they can go mess with them all day, can't they?
[00:34:59.198 --> 00:35:00.759]  And the media can then gang up on him.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:11.329]  So I tell the KKK and the black Israelites and Mecha and La Raza, you're all a bunch of damn trash funded by the big banks to make us all hate each other and I'm sick of your crap and I see right through you.
[00:35:11.369 --> 00:35:12.070]  You can go to hell.
[00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:15.333]  You're shameful, disgusting people.
[00:35:15.353 --> 00:35:20.778]  Let me tell you who's more disgusting, it's parents.
[00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:25.643]  That pay to send their students to get obsolete degrees.
[00:35:25.663 --> 00:35:28.104]  90 plus percent of degrees are obsolete.
[00:35:28.605 --> 00:35:29.785]  Not attacking higher education.
[00:35:29.845 --> 00:35:32.707]  It's been made obsolete by the bureaucracy and the corruption.
[00:35:32.987 --> 00:35:35.689]  And you go pay all this money for it and it's worthless!
[00:35:36.289 --> 00:35:38.950]  And all your children get is an indoctrination!
[00:35:44.714 --> 00:35:46.815]  Because this isn't some isolated thing.
[00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:50.417]  There's hundreds of these videos!
[00:35:51.664 --> 00:35:58.988]  Hell, there's all the famous videos saying no men, no white men, you know, allowed at Missouri State or whatever, out on the commons.
[00:35:59.648 --> 00:36:01.429]  And the woman goes, get me some muscle!
[00:36:01.929 --> 00:36:08.232]  And it's a weird chicken neck, crazy looking white woman telling black dudes to come stop white people from walking in the park.
[00:36:08.552 --> 00:36:09.453]  This is BS!
[00:36:09.913 --> 00:36:15.936]  But this is the lowest level of tribalism, of communism, of we're taking over your space.
[00:36:16.476 --> 00:36:17.276]  We're a gang.
[00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:18.417]  You're not allowed here.
[00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:33.252]  And because we've laid down so much as the original Americans, for every race, color, and creed, who believe in that Americana ideal, we have let these people run around and do this, and it's our fault.
[00:36:33.352 --> 00:36:34.493]  You wanna know whose fault it is?
[00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:35.053]  Look in the mirror.
[00:36:35.773 --> 00:36:42.935]  There are those that are more guilty, as V for Vendetta says, and they will be dealt with, but... Alright, I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[00:36:44.025 --> 00:36:46.446]  We've got Norm Patus 15 minutes to the next hour coming on.
[00:36:46.486 --> 00:36:47.187]  He's a great lawyer.
[00:36:47.207 --> 00:36:50.088]  He'll be able to take your calls and take any of your legal questions.
[00:36:50.168 --> 00:36:52.850]  We have first-time callers loaded up here as soon as these calls are gone.
[00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.391]  It's a free-for-all with legal questions for Norm Patus.
[00:36:55.631 --> 00:36:57.212]  So that's the next round of calls at 877-789-2539.
[00:36:57.232 --> 00:36:57.432]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:37:04.535 --> 00:37:05.655]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[00:37:06.596 --> 00:37:14.398]  I'm just going to tell you that we sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle with the nano-silver that's documented to take out the coronavirus family of SARS.
[00:37:15.378 --> 00:37:20.880]  We had the 3-ounce left and the 1-ounce left, and it will sell out by early next week.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.500]  And it funds our operations with 360Win.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.601]  But I use it to spray on my hands, the dispenser, in my throat.
[00:37:28.042 --> 00:37:29.122]  I hardly ever get sick.
[00:37:29.162 --> 00:37:32.243]  Started getting sick last week, drank a bunch of immune gargle, gone.
[00:37:33.032 --> 00:37:34.233]  We're good to go.
[00:37:59.502 --> 00:38:01.504]  The government's buying up all the storable food.
[00:38:02.245 --> 00:38:03.667]  My patriot won't sell it to them.
[00:38:04.187 --> 00:38:04.308]  U.S.
[00:38:04.328 --> 00:38:06.330]  military prepping for coronavirus pandemic.
[00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:07.131]  Military times.
[00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:13.158]  Virus death toll soars as China changes counting methods and now admits that it's just absolutely exploded.
[00:38:13.198 --> 00:38:13.899]  That's Reuters.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.145]  North Korea shoots dead coronavirus patient after he's seen at public baths.
[00:38:22.315 --> 00:38:24.057]  This is a race-specific bioweapon.
[00:38:24.157 --> 00:38:24.977]  It is man-made.
[00:38:25.038 --> 00:38:26.078]  That part's confirmed.
[00:38:26.619 --> 00:38:28.100]  That's why governments are freaking out.
[00:38:28.461 --> 00:38:34.486]  I hope it's not as bad as they're saying, but this is mutating and it's very, very serious in my view.
[00:38:35.467 --> 00:38:37.329]  And we're gonna go to a call that disagrees, though.
[00:38:37.389 --> 00:38:38.390]  First, that's why I raised that.
[00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.053]  Bryant in Texas, give us your view on the coronavirus, sir.
[00:38:43.314 --> 00:38:46.357]  Okay, I just want to say, the death to
[00:38:48.399 --> 00:38:58.145]  The ratio of how many people died to how many people are diagnosed with it doesn't match cases outside of China as the ones inside of China.
[00:38:58.225 --> 00:38:58.925]  It's a purge.
[00:38:58.965 --> 00:39:02.067]  They're purging their political dissonance.
[00:39:02.608 --> 00:39:13.254]  The only people who have died outside of China were people who were in China when they got the disease.
[00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:16.436]  But I don't even think it was the disease that killed them.
[00:39:16.923 --> 00:39:18.264]  Something else is killing them.
[00:39:35.939 --> 00:39:37.599]  There's been no deaths in any of the quarantines.
[00:39:37.639 --> 00:39:40.240]  We would be seeing deaths in Europe, everywhere.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:40.960]  United States, everywhere.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.481]  There aren't any.
[00:40:05.954 --> 00:40:07.235]  They're not dying of the virus.
[00:40:07.435 --> 00:40:08.335]  That's all I know.
[00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:15.759]  Well, definitely this has been a big godsend to GGPing, but I've learned something.
[00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:22.702]  When there's real deaths from a corona-type virus or other pneumonia virus, they covered it up.
[00:40:23.782 --> 00:40:24.743]  And I've confirmed that.
[00:40:25.003 --> 00:40:26.184]  That's come out in documents.
[00:40:26.484 --> 00:40:27.604]  It's happened to my family.
[00:40:28.024 --> 00:40:32.887]  So just because you're not hearing about deaths, I get why Trump
[00:40:33.883 --> 00:40:39.547]  Doesn't want people to know how serious this virus potentially could be, because he knows they want to use it to hurt the economy.
[00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:56.961]  But I think it's trumped, pun intended, by the public health fact that people deserve to know, and I think the fact that his own top scientist, and the fact that Senator Cotton and others are saying it's man-made, shows that Trump knows a lot of things the general public doesn't know.
[00:40:56.981 --> 00:40:57.421]  What do you think?
[00:40:58.342 --> 00:41:02.405]  It might be, but we can't trust anything China says, so all we can go by is
[00:41:03.021 --> 00:41:05.263]  How many people are dying outside of China?
[00:41:05.303 --> 00:41:06.264]  That's all I want to know.
[00:41:06.604 --> 00:41:07.605]  Who's contracted it?
[00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:11.468]  Who has spread it outside of China and somebody died outside of China?
[00:41:12.128 --> 00:41:12.529]  Nobody.
[00:41:12.569 --> 00:41:13.389]  It's not happening.
[00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:18.033]  The ones that died outside of China were in China when they got it.
[00:41:18.153 --> 00:41:21.936]  And the one in Japan, they haven't even confirmed that it was the virus that killed her.
[00:41:21.956 --> 00:41:23.237]  She was 60 years old.
[00:41:23.257 --> 00:41:24.899]  I hope you're right.
[00:41:24.959 --> 00:41:27.541]  That's why we have... Brother, brother, you don't disagree.
[00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:32.849]  I mean, every angle needs to be looked at.
[00:41:33.529 --> 00:41:37.971]  And clearly, Xi Jinping is using this for a power grab and to go after political dissidents.
[00:41:38.011 --> 00:41:40.672]  The question is, how deadly is the virus really?
[00:41:40.732 --> 00:41:41.372]  I hope you're right.
[00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:46.354]  But clearly, major universities, multiple ones now, say this is man-made.
[00:41:46.915 --> 00:41:48.615]  It's very obvious it's man-made.
[00:41:48.675 --> 00:41:50.856]  So, shouldn't we be concerned about that?
[00:41:51.377 --> 00:41:54.138]  If it's man-made, what's the point of having a harmless man-made virus?
[00:41:55.338 --> 00:41:56.879]  And then, why is the Pentagon concerned?
[00:41:58.098 --> 00:41:59.519]  I don't know about all that.
[00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:05.382]  All I know is, I just want to know how many people are dying outside of China.
[00:42:05.402 --> 00:42:05.983]  That's the only thing I know.
[00:42:06.003 --> 00:42:08.184]  That is an absolutely critical point.
[00:42:08.564 --> 00:42:10.605]  And we've got different official numbers.
[00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:13.167]  We'll put that up on screen actually, for TV viewers.
[00:42:13.727 --> 00:42:14.868]  Alright, thank you, Brian.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:23.627]  All right, Leo, Jamie, James, Jason, John, Bobby, Bill, Matthew, we're back in T-minus two minutes.
[00:42:24.187 --> 00:42:26.510]  What I do know is the red storm's here.
[00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:35.098]  Trump is purging the traitors, and he's accelerating in the attack, and I love it, and we have lived to see it, and I hope it continues on.
[00:42:35.218 --> 00:42:35.939]  Man, I love it.
[00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:40.103]  Ha ha ha, cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war.
[00:42:42.199 --> 00:42:46.323]  Well, they're trying to claim the President doesn't have the power to pardon Roger Stone.
[00:42:46.343 --> 00:42:52.310]  He doesn't have the power to say that nine years in prison is absolutely out of control, but of course he does.
[00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:59.097]  They say he doesn't have the power to block people from seven Islamic countries that don't have proper passport systems.
[00:42:59.117 --> 00:43:00.198]  Of course, he does.
[00:43:01.084 --> 00:43:02.645]  So that's all coming up with Norm Pattis.
[00:43:03.065 --> 00:43:05.907]  We're taking your phone calls right through the entire broadcast today.
[00:43:06.647 --> 00:43:08.048]  Let's go to Leo in Minnesota.
[00:43:08.528 --> 00:43:12.270]  The lie of systemic racism not found even in the ghetto.
[00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:21.515]  Yeah, that's really whatever I've always seen is groups try to use racism to control people, but at the grassroots, you really just don't see a lot of it.
[00:43:21.895 --> 00:43:25.357]  What do you make of that video of the University of Virginia telling whites they're not welcome?
[00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:28.752]  I think it's ridiculous, Alex.
[00:43:29.132 --> 00:43:34.776]  I mean, that's only things you find in these liberal institutions, in these colleges.
[00:43:34.856 --> 00:43:36.717]  Out here in the streets, you just don't see it.
[00:43:37.217 --> 00:43:45.042]  I mean, I've lived in the ghetto in Nevada, Florida, Mississippi, Boston, and I tell you what, it's just not there.
[00:43:45.583 --> 00:43:51.106]  Black, white, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, if you struggle in the ghetto, everybody sees through it.
[00:43:51.815 --> 00:43:54.396]  It's more of a class thing than it is a race thing.
[00:43:54.657 --> 00:43:55.177]  Exactly.
[00:43:55.277 --> 00:44:06.283]  And the globalists are using class warfare in the name of racism to divide the working class so they don't unify to broker a better deal and a more successful system.
[00:44:07.403 --> 00:44:09.204]  But you see, we're going to break through this.
[00:44:09.644 --> 00:44:12.726]  I believe the streets, they are conservative, Alex.
[00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:17.548]  The streets in your average thug is not for gay marriage.
[00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:18.349]  They're not for
[00:44:18.965 --> 00:44:19.926]  Transgenderism.
[00:44:19.946 --> 00:44:21.767]  They're not for Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:44:22.047 --> 00:44:26.411]  We just need to crack these streets and get to the people that are in these streets.
[00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:29.153]  And I truly believe that they will get behind Trump 100%.
[00:44:30.314 --> 00:44:31.455]  Well, I think it's already happened.
[00:44:31.475 --> 00:44:34.217]  That's why the left's trying to re-energize racism is.
[00:44:34.757 --> 00:44:36.979]  Trump has record Hispanic and black support.
[00:44:37.099 --> 00:44:38.360]  And that's why they're freaking out.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.422]  Because they're losing control of the plantations.
[00:44:42.363 --> 00:44:42.863]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:43.504 --> 00:44:45.986]  And as far as my case, I just want to thank you.
[00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:47.212]  Donald Trump?
[00:44:47.312 --> 00:44:56.271]  Because without the Survival Shield X2, and without Donald Trump, I'd still be a liberal, left-wing, crazy, believe-in-the-mainstream-media-pop-culture-in-Hollywood.
[00:44:56.672 --> 00:44:57.354]  You guys help me.
[00:44:57.884 --> 00:45:03.167]  The X2 gave me the clarity and the focus to read between the lines and understand what's really going on out here.
[00:45:03.568 --> 00:45:05.009]  By the way, that's not just hype.
[00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:10.492]  My IQ, that's what the studies show, went way up when I finally got on Clean Iodine eight years ago.
[00:45:10.972 --> 00:45:19.898]  And I'm not going to get graphic, but let's just say, you know, my wife certainly, let's just say this, it's good to be 16 again.
[00:45:20.238 --> 00:45:24.641]  It's just amazing how they hit us with the bad halogen fluoride and take away the good one.
[00:45:25.714 --> 00:45:34.298]  Yes sir, and I've even put my two and a half year old twins and I've supplemented them with iodine and their motor skills and it's tremendous compared to the other kids that are around.
[00:45:34.499 --> 00:45:35.539]  Oh, you gotta have it.
[00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:37.020]  If you don't have iodine, you die.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.242]  And then they're taking it out of everything so we don't have it, we're falling apart.
[00:45:41.622 --> 00:45:42.123]  It's amazing.
[00:45:42.143 --> 00:45:43.983]  So what happened when you started taking X2?
[00:45:45.464 --> 00:45:49.506]  Well, at first I felt a little drowsy and a little down.
[00:45:49.807 --> 00:45:50.147]  Exactly.
[00:45:50.167 --> 00:45:52.548]  But after a few weeks, I, you know, I got
[00:45:53.132 --> 00:45:53.972]  A lot of energy.
[00:45:54.132 --> 00:46:01.836]  You know, I'd take it in the morning before work and I'd have this burst of energy, clarity, and focus that I've never had before, Alex.
[00:46:01.956 --> 00:46:04.737]  Well, you've got to have it for electrochemical activity in the brain.
[00:46:05.858 --> 00:46:06.478]  But exactly.
[00:46:06.558 --> 00:46:15.982]  At first, though, it's going to push out of your cells the bad halogens, bromine, chloride, fluoride, and that's why you're going to be depressed and feel like crap for about three weeks.
[00:46:16.002 --> 00:46:17.123]  That's what most people have.
[00:46:17.443 --> 00:46:18.463]  I'll just be honest with people.
[00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:19.924]  But three weeks later,
[00:46:20.564 --> 00:46:26.306]  I liken it to, you ever like carried your kid on your shoulders upstairs and as soon as you take them off your shoulders you feel like you're flying?
[00:46:26.826 --> 00:46:31.128]  After three weeks of that it was like all of a sudden I woke up one day I was like what the hell's going on here?
[00:46:32.368 --> 00:46:38.430]  Exactly and you see I got my kids on it before they can get all of the poisonous toxins in their body.
[00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:43.592]  I wanted to get them with the iodine and you know get them as clear as I can get them.
[00:46:45.242 --> 00:46:45.762]  It's amazing.
[00:46:45.782 --> 00:46:46.523]  Dr. Group warned me.
[00:46:46.543 --> 00:46:50.426]  He said, look, he tried for like a year to get me to take it, and I'm like, yeah, right, iodine, you're a hippie.
[00:46:51.527 --> 00:46:52.828]  Hippies are always trying to take iodine.
[00:46:53.008 --> 00:46:58.472]  And then, man, like, I felt like crap about a week or two into it for about a week.
[00:46:58.492 --> 00:46:59.413]  I was like, man, this sucks.
[00:46:59.433 --> 00:47:01.414]  He goes, hey, just keep taking it, watch what happens.
[00:47:01.454 --> 00:47:05.697]  And I woke up one day and I was like, whoa, this is crazy.
[00:47:06.077 --> 00:47:06.978]  Thank you so much, Leo.
[00:47:07.018 --> 00:47:07.498]  God bless you.
[00:47:07.518 --> 00:47:08.980]  More calls in 60 seconds.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.400]  Stay with us.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:13.243]  All right, let's run through a bunch of your phone calls here.
[00:47:14.312 --> 00:47:15.313]  Let me make this statement.
[00:47:17.797 --> 00:47:26.809]  And again, a lot of things I say are super obvious, so I'm not insulting your intelligence, but it's celebrating those big obvious things that I've found leads to victory, the basics.
[00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:52.046]  The Jeffrey Epstein case and the fact that they covered it up and the child kidnapping blackmail rings really was a sea change for people because they'd all heard that for decades that was going on and they knew that we'd been harping on it and when that all turned out to be true and when they killed him to try to cover it up, it was a sea change.
[00:47:53.595 --> 00:48:01.806]  And there have been other events that have happened as well that have just really marked the signpost of the Big Awakening.
[00:48:02.847 --> 00:48:04.008]  But let me tell you something.
[00:48:05.891 --> 00:48:11.318]  When Roger Stone worked here for a couple years, I'd bitch at him.
[00:48:12.813 --> 00:48:16.154]  I'd say, man, you tell the best Nixon stories, you have the best political commentary.
[00:48:16.954 --> 00:48:22.035]  I said, I hired you to cover the news and talk about what's going on.
[00:48:22.355 --> 00:48:23.475]  You're really interesting.
[00:48:23.915 --> 00:48:31.557]  I don't want to hear how you're innocent and how it's all a witch hunt, because our listeners know that.
[00:48:32.017 --> 00:48:33.777]  Roger, when you go on Fox News, do it.
[00:48:33.957 --> 00:48:36.358]  But just do not, and he just would not listen to me.
[00:48:37.557 --> 00:48:38.057]  And I get it.
[00:48:38.158 --> 00:48:39.178]  He was falsely accused.
[00:48:39.198 --> 00:48:40.279]  They're trying to put him in jail.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.724]  They did end up indicting him, but our listeners know he's not a Russian agent and it's a bunch of BS.
[00:48:48.306 --> 00:48:52.630]  But now, it is as big as Epstein.
[00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.811]  I mean, people are so pissed.
[00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:56.092]  They know Roger did nothing.
[00:48:56.112 --> 00:48:57.514]  They know there's no Russia proof.
[00:48:57.914 --> 00:48:59.856]  Lying to Congress when he didn't even do it?
[00:49:00.814 --> 00:49:03.855]  People want a repudiation of Russiagate.
[00:49:04.295 --> 00:49:11.178]  We've been raped with this BS for four years, long before Trump got elected.
[00:49:11.218 --> 00:49:19.601]  We are so sick of it and we want to see him pardoned as a repudiation of the BS and the deep state saying, how dare you?
[00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:20.421]  You can't do this.
[00:49:20.761 --> 00:49:22.322]  You better stand down or you'll get in trouble.
[00:49:23.562 --> 00:49:29.745]  They want to see the rightful exercise of power by the executive branch and a vindication of the president in this and to stop
[00:49:30.538 --> 00:49:37.920]  Being cowed, to stop being buffaloed, to stop being dominated by this.
[00:49:40.301 --> 00:49:46.883]  But aside from that, as it comes out, the jurors were a bunch of Democrat operatives.
[00:49:47.883 --> 00:49:49.904]  And as it comes out, the judge is so corrupt.
[00:49:50.224 --> 00:49:54.505]  And as it comes out, they had a federal informant trying to set Stone up and he didn't even take the bait.
[00:49:54.905 --> 00:49:57.086]  Roger exposed this two years ago on the show.
[00:49:59.721 --> 00:50:06.005]  And they still use that guy to get Roger indicted, even though they admit he didn't do anything.
[00:50:07.266 --> 00:50:09.107]  This is dangerous to everybody.
[00:50:12.169 --> 00:50:16.932]  And everybody sees through it.
[00:50:18.132 --> 00:50:21.314]  People don't march up to me on the street anymore and say, F you, Russian agent.
[00:50:23.015 --> 00:50:26.698]  In fact, Democrats keep their fat, ugly mouth shut now, and that's good.
[00:50:27.679 --> 00:50:33.364]  I mean, they can have their speech all day long, but they don't feel so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed anymore.
[00:50:36.286 --> 00:50:38.448]  They also know when they get in my face, I don't back down.
[00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:41.750]  And it's not like I'm a tough guy, it's just a default.
[00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.452]  If someone starts screaming in my face, I'm gonna get right back and scream in yours.
[00:50:48.752 --> 00:50:52.435]  I mean, it's like five cups of coffee when one of these turds gets in my face.
[00:50:53.215 --> 00:51:01.641]  I'll be sitting there half awake in some restaurant and some jerk comes over and calls me a Russian agent and knocks my glass of tea over and says they're gonna beat my ass.
[00:51:01.702 --> 00:51:03.743]  I get up and just go, well, just take a swing.
[00:51:04.323 --> 00:51:08.446]  I've been wanting to break somebody's neck for a while and just get ready to die.
[00:51:12.089 --> 00:51:15.612]  Because see, you're in a man's world now where your fat mouths
[00:51:16.886 --> 00:51:19.008]  Put these checks out, you're gonna have to cash them.
[00:51:19.068 --> 00:51:19.869]  You understand how that works?
[00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:27.837]  I'm so sick of you cowards, but oh, as soon as it's the real world, oh, wait, leave me alone, wait, wait, you were just gonna beat my ass!
[00:51:29.439 --> 00:51:30.400]  You're a big guy!
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.981]  You just came over here!
[00:51:33.803 --> 00:51:34.604]  Beat my ass!
[00:51:34.844 --> 00:51:35.285]  Show me!
[00:51:35.405 --> 00:51:36.826]  Show me what it's like, please!
[00:51:38.208 --> 00:51:38.528]  Let's see.
[00:51:39.653 --> 00:51:41.314]  For the left, it's all about dress-up.
[00:51:41.394 --> 00:51:42.175]  It's all about theater.
[00:51:42.275 --> 00:51:43.555]  It's not the real world.
[00:51:43.856 --> 00:51:48.318]  They just want to come threaten to beat your ass, and then stand around in front of their buddies.
[00:51:48.558 --> 00:51:50.620]  They don't actually want to start swinging fists.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:52.661]  But see, I do.
[00:51:55.443 --> 00:51:57.004]  I want to politically swing fists.
[00:51:57.144 --> 00:51:58.384]  I want to restore the republic.
[00:51:58.705 --> 00:52:00.926]  I want to get these pedophiles off the backs of our children.
[00:52:01.226 --> 00:52:04.128]  I want victory, and I want it now, and so do a lot of other people.
[00:52:05.339 --> 00:52:11.388]  But see, somebody who knows how to fight, or somebody who's a man, they're not going to start a fight with me, because they already have it.
[00:52:11.608 --> 00:52:12.930]  They don't need to go out and prove it.
[00:52:13.752 --> 00:52:14.793]  And that's our problem.
[00:52:15.314 --> 00:52:19.019]  As men, we have to stop putting up with these globalist turd baskets.
[00:52:20.325 --> 00:52:31.008]  And stop kissing their asses, and stop letting them intimidate us, and stop... It's not even intimidation, like, well, I don't want to make a scene, I better just, you know, just kind of bow down to them and they'll go away.
[00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:32.869]  No, they're not going away!
[00:52:33.469 --> 00:52:40.651]  And they're going around and messing with people that are more easily intimidated, so it's our job as men to get back in their face aggressively.
[00:52:42.172 --> 00:52:46.713]  I'm not looking for trouble, but if you're looking for trouble, you know the old saying, you came to the right place.
[00:52:48.137 --> 00:52:51.880]  And so people ask why I freak out when they get in my face, because these are bullies, man.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.141]  These are the enemy.
[00:52:53.961 --> 00:53:00.426]  And I want them to remember that it's their night that's ruined, not mine.
[00:53:01.087 --> 00:53:03.449]  I'll take the steak off their table when they get in my face.
[00:53:03.669 --> 00:53:04.950]  Come over to my table, talk crap to me.
[00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:06.651]  I get up and walk over to their wife and them.
[00:53:06.711 --> 00:53:07.692]  I go, hey, how's your steak?
[00:53:07.992 --> 00:53:08.772]  I'm going to eat your steak.
[00:53:08.933 --> 00:53:10.053]  See, because that's what it's about.
[00:53:10.314 --> 00:53:11.575]  You came to ruin my night.
[00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:13.116]  I'm going to eat your steak.
[00:53:16.243 --> 00:53:22.889]  Because they need to know that I'm not going to bow down to their BS, and you're not going to bow down anymore, because we're not slaves.
[00:53:23.609 --> 00:53:24.390]  That's all I'm saying!
[00:53:26.552 --> 00:53:27.713]  Don't tread on me.
[00:53:27.753 --> 00:53:29.554]  That's the country's first symbol, was a snake.
[00:53:30.095 --> 00:53:34.959]  We're not looking for trouble, but if you want to start a fight, you came to the right area.
[00:53:35.299 --> 00:53:36.581]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[00:53:36.601 --> 00:53:43.767]  See all these Roger Stone calls I'll get to once our guest is here with us in the next segment, from Jason and James.
[00:53:47.261 --> 00:53:49.522]  They all want to talk about Roger Stone, so we're going to get to that.
[00:53:49.542 --> 00:53:54.505]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matthew in Texas.
[00:53:54.545 --> 00:53:55.766]  Matthew, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:53:57.086 --> 00:53:57.967]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[00:53:58.547 --> 00:53:59.388]  I'm fired up, brother.
[00:53:59.908 --> 00:54:01.008]  Can you see the big awakening?
[00:54:01.529 --> 00:54:02.509]  Trump's starting to push back.
[00:54:02.729 --> 00:54:05.531]  I want to see a lot more of this, but this is getting me really excited.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:07.160]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:08.581]  I'm excited as well.
[00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:09.981]  It's been a long time coming.
[00:54:10.001 --> 00:54:24.006]  It seems like three plus years, four years, maybe five years going on that all these events have been happening as far as Hillary, as far as all the corruption goes, and the whole swamp creatures attacking the president and attempting to
[00:54:25.612 --> 00:54:28.094]  And paid him in every way, shape and form.
[00:54:28.134 --> 00:54:40.586]  But what I thought about was, today, Mayor Ron Nuremberg from San Antonio came out and he talked about the coronavirus, about the evacuees from the Hubei region.
[00:54:41.627 --> 00:54:46.471]  And today we had our first confirmed case, according to Mayor Ron Nuremberg and the CDC.
[00:54:49.045 --> 00:54:50.886]  You know, it's sobering.
[00:54:51.467 --> 00:54:56.310]  It's really sobering to think that something like that can be in your backyard and definitely in my backyard.
[00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:59.813]  I live maybe five minutes away from Lackland Air Force Base.
[00:55:00.493 --> 00:55:03.235]  Between Lackland Air Force Base and what used to be Kelly Air Force Base.
[00:55:04.256 --> 00:55:17.986]  And I just don't understand why they would even bring any sort of individuals who may be under that, infected with that, have any sickness from anywhere overseas back onto the mainland.
[00:55:19.286 --> 00:55:24.950]  I'm sure they have bases and decommissioned buildings, things like that.
[00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.490]  No, they do.
[00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:26.291]  That's a good point.
[00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:29.173]  Well, the problem is, though, we have those in third-party countries.
[00:55:29.193 --> 00:55:29.914]  They don't want it either.
[00:55:29.994 --> 00:55:31.595]  But, I mean, I hear you.
[00:55:32.616 --> 00:55:34.597]  A lot of people don't want to believe this virus is deadly.
[00:55:34.737 --> 00:55:35.698]  I hope that's the case.
[00:55:35.758 --> 00:55:40.161]  But we know it's man-made, and we know that the Pentagon is really concerned about it.
[00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:41.582]  I think for good reason.
[00:55:42.342 --> 00:55:43.623]  We know it's mutating, too.
[00:55:49.941 --> 00:55:56.665]  It's, like I said, yeah, it's a sobering thing to think that it's right here in our backyard.
[00:55:57.125 --> 00:56:02.868]  And like I said, right in Lackland, it's just, it's insane that they didn't use somewhere else.
[00:56:03.088 --> 00:56:14.894]  Somewhere, like I'm even sure an island, I don't want to say like Puerto Rico or something like that, but something that's involved with the United States, at least, that they could have reached before they hit the mainland, if they're already going to travel that far.
[00:56:15.689 --> 00:56:21.776]  But I know since like maybe November, here too, I've been seeing a lot of drones flying over at night.
[00:56:22.137 --> 00:56:28.184]  There have been a lot of different flights, but I think that might just be because of the whole Boeing 737 MAX thing or whatever.
[00:56:28.564 --> 00:56:29.906]  There's a lot of craziness, brother.
[00:56:30.146 --> 00:56:31.387]  Give us the intel.
[00:56:31.407 --> 00:56:32.449]  Keep watching and thank you.
[00:56:32.469 --> 00:56:34.171]  More calls straight ahead, Norm Pattison Studio.
[00:56:35.652 --> 00:56:45.396]  Okay, we've had a lot of callers holding over from the last hour wanting to talk about Roger Stone and talk to Norm Pattis, a very successful First Amendment and, of course, criminal lawyer, very well known.
[00:56:45.416 --> 00:56:46.917]  You see him all over national television.
[00:56:50.018 --> 00:56:51.419]  We should go ahead and make this announcement.
[00:56:51.459 --> 00:56:53.400]  You've been talking about this for a few days with me.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.381]  We pulled the trigger earlier.
[00:56:56.843 --> 00:56:57.664]  We're good to go.
[00:57:16.943 --> 00:57:18.504]  I mean, conflicts of interest that are incredible.
[00:57:18.524 --> 00:57:20.946]  Remember, they called a few months ago for my arrest in the Washington Post.
[00:57:21.526 --> 00:57:26.810]  Even though the Supreme Court's ruled it's totally normal to put out who jurors are for the intent of, you know, finding out they have a conflict.
[00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:28.071]  I wasn't trying to intimidate anybody.
[00:57:29.372 --> 00:57:31.574]  But it seems like this whole house of cards, Norm Pattis...
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.401]  He's starting to collapse for them.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:58:07.458]  But had run for Congress as a Democrat and has been sitting silently all this time and now couldn't hold her tongue any longer and was expressing outrage over the fact that these four prosecutors quit the other day.
[00:58:07.659 --> 00:58:08.780]  So she has venom!
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.383]  She said, I want him in prison!
[00:58:10.703 --> 00:58:17.145]  My view is that that sort of venom should have been detected in a normal voir dire or jury selection process.
[00:58:17.265 --> 00:58:25.307]  And if this stealth juror was permitted to slip through in spite of that bias, or she didn't disclose the bias, there's actual juror misconduct.
[00:58:25.647 --> 00:58:30.508]  And that sort of misconduct would necessarily result in a mistrial and a new trial for Mr. Stone.
[00:58:30.868 --> 00:58:34.469]  What about the separate issue, Norm, of the president?
[00:58:35.469 --> 00:58:38.270]  He has the pardon power, he has the ability to commute as well.
[00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:41.771]  He could let the conviction stand and decide any sentence is too long.
[00:58:54.734 --> 00:58:57.858]  I think his role in events this week has been overstated.
[00:58:58.218 --> 00:59:01.082]  I think what we have here is a routine administrative failure.
[00:59:01.442 --> 00:59:03.385]  And you see it in the New York Times this morning.
[00:59:03.645 --> 00:59:07.830]  Among the four prosecutors who resigned, one of the young men was a member of the Public Integrity Unit.
[00:59:08.308 --> 00:59:20.256]  It is routine business in the Justice Department in prosecutions such as Mr. Stone's to have sentencing recommendations and charging decisions run up the chain of command to Washington, D.C.
[00:59:20.576 --> 00:59:21.997]  This is not unusual.
[00:59:22.357 --> 00:59:28.762]  The fact that the President saw this in the paper apparently surprised him and surprised some senior people in the Justice Department.
[00:59:28.982 --> 00:59:33.985]  They were within their rights to recall and withdraw the sentencing memo.
[00:59:34.285 --> 00:59:35.426]  It's not unusual.
[00:59:38.528 --> 00:59:42.089]  That it was going to be a lighter recommendation that they lied reportedly in writing.
[00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:44.350]  And then now recommended a bigger one.
[00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:45.370]  These people are out of control.
[00:59:46.031 --> 00:59:46.771]  I don't know anything about that.
[00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:47.591]  That's news to me.
[00:59:47.671 --> 00:59:50.712]  I mean the sentencing guidelines themselves are little understood.
[00:59:50.852 --> 00:59:56.494]  Reading the papers you would think that somehow the government has been speaking with two voices in ways that matter.
[00:59:57.354 --> 00:59:57.795]  It doesn't.
[00:59:58.015 --> 01:00:05.980]  The sentencing guidelines are a complicated cookbook that are designed to help a judge decide what an appropriate sentence is.
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.841]  The federal sentencing guideline regime was created in the 1980s.
[01:00:08.902 --> 01:00:13.444]  It was created to promote uniformity among the 94 federal district courts.
[01:00:13.965 --> 01:00:18.508]  Every offense has what's called a base offense level, whether it's seven or nine points.
[01:00:18.888 --> 01:00:23.831]  I mean, you add offense characteristic points to that to come up with some aggregate number for the offense.
[01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:24.571]  In this case, it was 29.
[01:00:25.812 --> 01:00:33.861]  If you put that number 29 on a table and then you move over on the criminal history, Mr. Stone had none so he was a 1, that yields a sentencing range.
[01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:37.866]  That's where the 7 to 9 month sentencing recommendation occurred.
[01:00:38.473 --> 01:00:44.516]  In the Justice Department's sentencing memo, it added points to the base offense level that arguably it shouldn't have added.
[01:00:45.277 --> 01:00:49.659]  For example, there was eight points added for physically threatening a witness.
[01:00:50.019 --> 01:00:59.364]  I'm not sure making a comment about a dog or some of the off-color comments that Stone made to Puerto Rico constitute a physical threat.
[01:00:59.705 --> 01:01:05.748]  And so I think the Justice Department withdrawing or walking back that eight points was actually speaking sense, and I don't think
[01:01:05.888 --> 01:01:08.350]  Sure, and I don't think you needed President Trump to do this.
[01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:18.020]  As Trump and sentencing reform and judicial reform and prison reform, but separate from that, the public's mad about this Roger Stone thing.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:29.591]  They really get that this is the end of this whole fake Russiagate fiasco and no one is buying that he should serve seven to nine years in prison when the average armed robber serves less than four.
[01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:37.295]  Well, I don't know about that, but I do know, you say no one, but I looked at the New York Times editorial this morning and I was stunned by what I read.
[01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:40.637]  I mean, they've out and out made misrepresentations of fact.
[01:01:40.957 --> 01:01:49.363]  The editorial reads, and I quote, Mr. Stone also threatened at the federal judge presiding over his case, which his lawyers talked up to anxiety for which he was undergoing therapy.
[01:01:49.703 --> 01:01:56.087]  At one point on a social media account, a photograph of the judge appeared near a targeting symbol.
[01:01:56.107 --> 01:01:56.928]  But it wasn't even that.
[01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:58.189]  It was like bullet points.
[01:01:58.229 --> 01:02:00.090]  No, I know, but that's not a threat.
[01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:02.491]  Under any conceivable stretch of the law.
[01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:08.575]  And for the New York Times, you know, the old gray lady to come out and print and accuse threatening on this record is outrageous.
[01:02:08.595 --> 01:02:11.197]  Well, it shows, though, that they'll do anything now.
[01:02:11.257 --> 01:02:12.538]  And they go on.
[01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:20.243]  They said the government had sought a prison sentence of seven to nine years, which was within the sentencing guidelines range.
[01:02:20.683 --> 01:02:25.466]  I don't know who the ignoramus was who wrote that editorial, but here's a memo to the New York Times.
[01:02:25.766 --> 01:02:27.708]  Get a lawyer to read your material.
[01:02:28.188 --> 01:02:30.692]  Sentencing recommendations are simply arguments.
[01:02:31.012 --> 01:02:36.881]  The government or some lawyers within the government could have argued that they thought he should go to prison for seven to nine years.
[01:02:36.901 --> 01:02:37.743]  But Norm, they know that.
[01:02:37.803 --> 01:02:38.644]  They're a fraud.
[01:02:38.704 --> 01:02:40.427]  They lied about WMDs in Iraq.
[01:02:40.808 --> 01:02:43.492]  This is the New York Times, the standard of deception.
[01:02:44.273 --> 01:02:47.836]  I like the paper, I read it every day, but here's another whopper from their editorial.
[01:02:47.956 --> 01:02:53.061]  Mr. Trump openly interfered in the trial and sentencing of one of his oldest and staunchest allies.
[01:02:53.141 --> 01:02:55.644]  Where did Mr. Trump interfere in the trial?
[01:02:55.664 --> 01:02:58.366]  The trial is a separate stage from sentencing.
[01:02:58.406 --> 01:03:03.932]  Well, when Trump would talk about impeachment and defend himself, they said that was interfering with the impeachment.
[01:03:04.332 --> 01:03:08.196]  Since when does a defendant having a voice be interference?
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.441]  Well, they go on.
[01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:16.066]  Actually, the Times didn't address this because I think the Times still has some loyalty to the First Amendment.
[01:03:16.287 --> 01:03:18.969]  But consider what happened to Mr. Stone after he was convicted.
[01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:27.478]  You apparently were brought into the trial record and the claim was that Mr. Stone violated a gag order potentially by him or someone else ostensibly reaching out to you.
[01:03:28.598 --> 01:03:35.342]  Why Mr. Stone wasn't in the District Court of Appeals the next day to challenge that gag order is one of the law's great mysteries in my mind right now.
[01:03:35.522 --> 01:03:37.783]  Oh no, his lawyers have led him to the slaughter.
[01:03:37.803 --> 01:03:40.244]  I have never seen a gag order.
[01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:41.085]  Roger can't talk.
[01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:45.767]  I've just talked to people close to Roger Stone and they know that those lawyers led him to the slaughter.
[01:03:46.107 --> 01:03:51.290]  But the good news is the president is about to exercise his veto pin over
[01:03:53.086 --> 01:03:56.629]  Judicial tyranny and is going to pardon Stone.
[01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:02.835]  He has that right, and if he does, I'm sure people will claim that that's an obstruction of justice, but it's a right that every president uses.
[01:04:03.276 --> 01:04:10.583]  President Trump has the power as the executive to commute or exonerate if he chooses.
[01:04:11.123 --> 01:04:15.928]  We keep asking Norm Pattis, a famous lawyer here with me, what the next scandal will be.
[01:04:15.988 --> 01:04:17.829]  Pelosi says it's the pardon of Stone.
[01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:20.453]  So that's their next big scandal?
[01:04:20.493 --> 01:04:20.713]  Good.
[01:04:20.733 --> 01:04:22.116]  That goes right back to Russiagate.
[01:04:22.516 --> 01:04:23.858]  Right back to the fraud they pushed.
[01:04:23.918 --> 01:04:24.099]  Good.
[01:04:24.119 --> 01:04:26.863]  Let's just go right back in there because this will repudiate them.
[01:04:26.903 --> 01:04:29.066]  I promise when we come back we're going right to your phone calls.
[01:04:29.587 --> 01:04:31.150]  Right to your phone calls.
[01:04:31.751 --> 01:04:32.371]  We're going to go to...
[01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:39.813]  Daniel, we're gonna go to James, we're gonna go to John, John, Bobby, Bill, Greg, Steve, and so many others.
[01:04:39.953 --> 01:04:44.475]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Band.video.
[01:04:44.515 --> 01:04:52.238]  Remember, when you spread that by word of mouth or via email or text message, while you still can, they're now censoring that, it's an act of resistance.
[01:04:52.358 --> 01:04:53.778]  Band.video.
[01:04:55.619 --> 01:04:56.139]  Welcome back.
[01:04:56.159 --> 01:04:57.180]  We're going to your phone calls.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.380]  Constitutional lawyer Norm Pattis is our guest.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.521]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:05:02.321 --> 01:05:03.582]  You were saying during the break,
[01:05:05.293 --> 01:05:12.197]  The jurors, not just one, but multiple ones being Democrat party operatives running for major office, saying they want to destroy Roger Stone.
[01:05:12.657 --> 01:05:26.946]  Turns out on social media before and after, now that we know who their names are, this one woman that worked in Homeland Security and then her husband was a lawyer on the Mueller probe, high level, and the judge had said, oh, it's okay, you can stay on.
[01:05:27.466 --> 01:05:31.528]  But then we made an issue out of it, and so she was let go.
[01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:36.391]  She was cut from the jury and they said, arrest me in the Washington Post.
[01:05:37.052 --> 01:05:40.834]  But then as you pointed out, that's right there in the Constitution, Supreme Court rulings.
[01:05:41.654 --> 01:05:42.975]  We were doing our job.
[01:05:43.235 --> 01:06:00.525]  But as you were pointing out, with all this coming out, the fact they used a federal informant that they didn't tell the court was an informant to put out this info on Stone, that really, you're saying sentencing should be postponed so that perhaps the whole trial gets overturned?
[01:06:00.565 --> 01:06:01.245]  Or what's the process?
[01:06:01.485 --> 01:06:07.029]  Under the Sixth Amendment, you're entitled to a jury of your peers, and that's a fair and impartial jury.
[01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:15.636]  Historically, what that's meant is that these are jurors who have not formed views of the case so significant that they're likely to affect how they evaluate the evidence.
[01:06:16.317 --> 01:06:20.880]  In some courts, that means people don't know anything about the parties or the participants.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.602]  That's rare in a high-profile case.
[01:06:23.042 --> 01:06:25.003]  Typically, they just have to be impartial.
[01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:30.348]  They have to set aside whatever they've heard and commit to being able to try the case based on the evidence in the courtroom.
[01:06:31.168 --> 01:06:37.692]  However, the participants are entitled to an honest answer with respect to sources of bias that jurors may have.
[01:06:38.172 --> 01:06:43.895]  Now, Mike Cernovich is reporting that one of the jurors had run for Congress as a Democrat prior to the trial.
[01:06:44.335 --> 01:06:49.398]  It's unclear to me as I sit here today whether that was disclosed to the lawyers in the case.
[01:06:50.358 --> 01:07:01.544]  This juror has now come forward and written about her outrage over the resignation of the four trial prosecutors this week, suggesting that in fact she had very strong views at the time of trial.
[01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:19.373]  If questions were asked about this and she didn't answer truthfully or she didn't answer honestly or she answered in a deceptive fashion, Mr. Stone's right to a fair and impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment may have been abridged and that would be a sufficient reason to set the verdict aside and for him to be tried again.
[01:07:21.233 --> 01:07:31.437]  What do you call this hysteria where the left just abandons any pretense of jurisprudence, of chivalry, of fairness, in the name of getting Trump?
[01:07:32.117 --> 01:07:35.058]  And it's not worked for them, so what are they going to do next?
[01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:35.838]  Even more corrupt?
[01:07:36.298 --> 01:07:37.519]  I have no idea what happens next.
[01:08:06.758 --> 01:08:08.679]  None, but I'll stay tuned and I'll be watching.
[01:08:27.023 --> 01:08:30.145]  There is a partisan divide in this country that I don't understand.
[01:08:30.165 --> 01:08:31.887]  You know, some people love Trump.
[01:08:32.347 --> 01:08:33.107]  Some people hate him.
[01:08:33.288 --> 01:08:34.488]  I live on one of the coasts.
[01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.690]  I live in the East Coast, in the New Haven area.
[01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:39.832]  Trump is not a popular figure out there.
[01:08:39.872 --> 01:08:40.853]  People are rooting against him.
[01:08:40.893 --> 01:08:46.117]  But yet, when I visit Middle America, I hear suspicion of the place where I live and great admiration for Trump.
[01:08:46.477 --> 01:08:50.318]  That divide is going to drive this country in too, unless it's addressed.
[01:08:50.418 --> 01:08:55.480]  And I wish the media played a leadership role and took a critical view at these issues.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.361]  The Times editorial this morning shocked me for the amount of things that got wrong.
[01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.802]  Normally when I'm reading the press, I'm like everybody else.
[01:09:01.902 --> 01:09:03.202]  I don't know quite what to believe.
[01:09:03.262 --> 01:09:03.902]  I wasn't there.
[01:09:03.983 --> 01:09:04.483]  I don't know.
[01:09:05.943 --> 01:09:10.445]  Yeah, I know a thing or two about the criminal justice system, and I know when I've been sold a bill of goods.
[01:09:11.065 --> 01:09:23.469]  Donald Trump may not be your cup of tea, but to use the Roger Stone drama this week, which is a routine administrative failure, as an example of, quote, Mr. Trump's rule of lawlessness, end quote, costs you credibility in my mind.
[01:09:23.509 --> 01:09:26.049]  If I say shame on the New York Times, they got this one wrong.
[01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:29.670]  Let's go to some phone calls here.
[01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:30.631]  Thanks for holding, folks.
[01:09:31.731 --> 01:09:33.412]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Indiana.
[01:09:33.432 --> 01:09:34.592]  James, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:09:36.601 --> 01:09:37.921]  Hey guys, thanks for having me.
[01:09:38.061 --> 01:09:39.642]  I got a statement and then I have a legal question.
[01:09:40.742 --> 01:09:49.703]  With the Roger Stone miscarriage of justice, the federal government has committed crimes all over America, from theft, homicide, trying to overthrow the government, to lying to Congress as they turn a blind eye.
[01:09:49.723 --> 01:09:52.264]  You have 60 agents taking bribes and committing crimes.
[01:09:52.284 --> 01:09:56.465]  The DOJ crimes from everywhere, from lying, drugs, theft, hiding and destroying evidence.
[01:09:57.385 --> 01:10:03.386]  There will never be full criminal justice reform until the DOJ is restructured to help and not destroy everyone with trickery and lies.
[01:10:04.031 --> 01:10:06.334]  There is no due process because everybody is convicted.
[01:10:06.714 --> 01:10:09.517]  If this was the time of Lincoln, all these crooks would have been headed to the gallows.
[01:10:10.659 --> 01:10:11.179]  Well, you're right.
[01:10:11.199 --> 01:10:13.962]  I think the federal conviction rate's like 90-something percent.
[01:10:14.823 --> 01:10:20.069]  And people just see this as emblematic of all the other corruption and the things they've seen people get away with.
[01:10:20.129 --> 01:10:23.133]  And now Roger Stone lying to Congress without even having evidence?
[01:10:24.431 --> 01:10:25.472]  I mean, what was the question?
[01:10:25.492 --> 01:10:28.454]  I'm not sure that I'm as cynical as you about the government yet.
[01:10:28.514 --> 01:10:34.318]  I still go to court every day and expect justice and expect the courts to apply the rules, and more often than not, they do.
[01:10:34.638 --> 01:10:39.461]  There are conspicuous failures, and it looks to me like the Stone case may be one of them.
[01:10:39.481 --> 01:10:41.242]  Yeah, the decision's been made.
[01:10:41.603 --> 01:10:43.044]  If you're going after Trump, break the rules.
[01:10:45.105 --> 01:10:47.547]  Again, I'm going to just comment on a case-by-case basis.
[01:10:47.627 --> 01:10:52.191]  I hadn't paid close enough attention to the Roger Stone case, apparently.
[01:10:52.251 --> 01:10:55.294]  My office is, as we speak, obtaining the trial transcripts.
[01:10:55.614 --> 01:11:01.940]  We're also getting the transcripts of the voir dire, that is the jury selection process, and any questionnaires jurors filled out.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:07.122]  Based on the misinformation I'm seeing in the press this week, I want answers about that case.
[01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:11.945]  I've not yet come to the point where I've concluded that my government is my enemy.
[01:11:12.265 --> 01:11:14.546]  I simply don't trust it and I want answers to these questions.
[01:11:14.566 --> 01:11:22.090]  Well, the caller's saying there's corrupt cabals operating with impunity and hopefully what they tried on Trump backfires and now routes the whole group of them.
[01:11:23.031 --> 01:11:24.311]  James, what was your legal question?
[01:11:25.352 --> 01:11:30.915]  Sure, my legal question is because it was a hoax and a fraud, Russia, does the fruit of the poisonous tree
[01:11:31.904 --> 01:11:36.247]  Make this where everybody needs to be released from stone to even Trump's worthless lawyer?
[01:11:36.808 --> 01:11:37.488]  Absolutely!
[01:11:38.789 --> 01:11:43.772]  Sorry Norm, you're the lawyer, but if something is based on a fraud from the beginning, doesn't it all get thrown out the window?
[01:11:44.072 --> 01:11:44.793]  Not necessarily.
[01:11:44.833 --> 01:12:01.144]  The fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is a Fourth Amendment concept, and it says that if evidence is seized unlawfully, that is, without a warrant, they enter to your home and there's no justification for the entry, they can't use that fruit of the poisonous tree of the illegal search in the case against you.
[01:12:01.724 --> 01:12:08.390]  You know, with respect to a broader consensus about truth and legitimacy, those aren't really legal concepts.
[01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:09.611]  Those are political questions.
[01:12:09.651 --> 01:12:16.697]  And James, your comments suggest that to me, that the crisis is far deeper than one going on in legal institutions.
[01:12:16.717 --> 01:12:20.981]  It's a very crisis of legitimacy, whether the government actually represents the people.
[01:12:21.021 --> 01:12:22.062]  Yeah, social contracting, bro.
[01:12:22.082 --> 01:12:22.202]  Yeah.
[01:12:22.262 --> 01:12:24.364]  No, that's really a political question, not a legal question.
[01:12:24.384 --> 01:12:25.645]  All right, James, thank you.
[01:12:26.506 --> 01:12:27.246]  Let's go ahead.
[01:12:30.267 --> 01:12:31.528]  Talk to Bobby in Colorado.
[01:12:31.568 --> 01:12:32.208]  Bobby, you're on the air.
[01:12:32.228 --> 01:12:32.568]  Go ahead.
[01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.690]  Hi, how's it going?
[01:12:35.911 --> 01:12:36.251]  Good, brother.
[01:12:36.271 --> 01:12:36.571]  Go ahead.
[01:12:37.972 --> 01:12:46.237]  Yeah, I just was listening to David Nijsko yesterday, and you had mentioned that you had thought that, from what you had seen of the Roger Stone trial, that you thought he did lie to Congress.
[01:12:46.377 --> 01:12:47.778]  I was hoping you could elaborate on that.
[01:12:48.362 --> 01:12:50.563]  I hadn't paid a lot of attention, Bobby, I'll be honest with you.
[01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:57.005]  You know, I'm a busy lawyer, I've got clients, I go to court every day, so I'm reading the newspaper, and maybe I'm reading a poisoned press.
[01:12:57.325 --> 01:13:02.227]  But it seemed to me that he had said at one point, that he had made statements that were inconsistent with one another.
[01:13:02.927 --> 01:13:08.249]  At one point he said he had contacts with Assange, and at other points he said he didn't make attempts to get information.
[01:13:08.729 --> 01:13:09.750]  Both can't be true.
[01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:12.012]  If he said both to Congress, then he lied.
[01:13:12.032 --> 01:13:18.398]  The question would then be, did he have the intent to lie, or was he BSing, or did they misconstrue his comments?
[01:13:18.418 --> 01:13:22.521]  Well, when he says, I'm trying to talk to WikiLeaks, that means he's trying to talk to them.
[01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:23.362]  It doesn't mean he talked to them.
[01:13:23.683 --> 01:13:27.886]  And I think there was some claims that he said at one point, or at least led people to believe he did.
[01:13:28.147 --> 01:13:30.709]  And this is the reason, Alex, that we're ordering the trial transcript today.
[01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:32.611]  I will admit to you and to your viewers,
[01:13:33.251 --> 01:13:34.431]  I didn't pay attention to the trial.
[01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:35.712]  Here I am talking about it.
[01:13:35.952 --> 01:13:38.032]  That makes me as bad as the New York Times, I suppose.
[01:13:38.312 --> 01:13:42.733]  But I want answers, and I'm going to read that trial transcript, and when I do, I'll come back and tell you what I think.
[01:13:42.753 --> 01:13:46.314]  Regardless, the thing's politically motivated, so it's all a fraud to begin with.
[01:13:47.754 --> 01:13:49.035]  You know, I can't go that far.
[01:13:49.075 --> 01:13:50.395]  I'm still an officer of the court.
[01:13:50.795 --> 01:13:55.456]  When I represent a client in a courtroom, I believe that I can obtain something like justice for them.
[01:13:55.496 --> 01:13:57.337]  If I didn't believe that, I'd quit practicing law.
[01:13:58.017 --> 01:13:58.317]  All right.
[01:13:58.337 --> 01:13:59.037]  Anything else, Bobby?
[01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:11.254]  Yeah, I live here in Colorado, and we got Governor Polis, and we all voted to shut down Proposition 112, and then they brought in Senate Bill 181, and they're just taking over.
[01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:15.558]  They brought in the red flag laws, they put a ban on our energy rights.
[01:14:16.339 --> 01:14:21.905]  I mean, these Democrats have, across the board, across the nation, they have the same
[01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:25.775]  That's right.
[01:14:26.175 --> 01:14:27.596]  It's a plan for tyranny.
[01:14:28.037 --> 01:14:28.938]  It's a global government.
[01:14:28.978 --> 01:14:29.778]  We've got to resist it.
[01:14:29.818 --> 01:14:30.739]  Thank you so much, Bobby.
[01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:33.762]  I want to take your phone calls.
[01:14:33.782 --> 01:14:34.763]  Norm Pattis is here.
[01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:36.324]  Another guest popping in next hour.
[01:14:36.344 --> 01:14:38.086]  We'll continue with calls as well.
[01:14:38.146 --> 01:14:39.968]  But look at this.
[01:14:41.369 --> 01:14:46.253]  Cambridge Academic says human race must become extinct to save the planet.
[01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:49.123]  That's that whole Extinction Rebellion.
[01:14:49.684 --> 01:14:50.525]  And guess what?
[01:14:50.585 --> 01:14:56.572]  She's got Medusa on her arm and devil tattoos and is into nihilism and destruction.
[01:14:57.373 --> 01:14:58.634]  Well, hey, here's the deal, honey.
[01:14:58.654 --> 01:15:03.440]  You just get yourself a big old tank of vodka and some barbiturates and kill yourself.
[01:15:04.321 --> 01:15:08.184]  Because you're into death, you're into destruction, you've given up on humanity.
[01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:09.185]  I don't want you to kill yourself.
[01:15:09.685 --> 01:15:13.407]  I'm just simply telling you, you got that broadcast, go take care of it.
[01:15:13.748 --> 01:15:16.750]  Get in the bathtub, slip those wrists, go see Jesus.
[01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:23.334]  And I don't mean that to be mean here, but you know, they're pushing abortion, they're saying humans suck, let's get rid of humanity.
[01:15:24.255 --> 01:15:26.837]  And of course, she's a vampire.
[01:15:28.038 --> 01:15:32.521]  She wants us to decide to give up our life force so this clown can feed on us.
[01:15:33.499 --> 01:15:36.382]  So again, lady, lead by example.
[01:15:37.964 --> 01:15:43.270]  I'll give her some respect if she jumps off a building today or slits her wrist.
[01:15:43.731 --> 01:15:45.232]  And again, I'm not saying she should do that.
[01:15:45.613 --> 01:15:47.035]  She just says we should all die.
[01:15:47.115 --> 01:15:47.976]  Well, her first, Norm.
[01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:53.792]  Wow, I mean, I don't know what to make of that.
[01:15:53.832 --> 01:15:58.333]  What's her loyalty to the planet that she somehow sacrifices her loyalty to the human race?
[01:15:58.893 --> 01:16:03.934]  Certainly, we have challenges to survive and she appears to be one of them.
[01:16:03.994 --> 01:16:07.215]  I mean, taking one look at her, I can see why the human race might go extinct.
[01:16:08.535 --> 01:16:09.616]  Well, yeah, no wonder.
[01:16:09.636 --> 01:16:11.236]  I mean, I don't want to have any babies with her.
[01:16:11.256 --> 01:16:14.057]  But she's obviously a death worshiper.
[01:16:14.097 --> 01:16:15.097]  She's a death cult person.
[01:16:16.173 --> 01:16:17.435]  And this is who our academics are.
[01:16:17.475 --> 01:16:19.537]  This is who the system wants us to hear from.
[01:16:19.557 --> 01:16:20.318]  So I'm just telling her.
[01:16:20.438 --> 01:16:23.461]  I hope she doesn't commit suicide, but lady, you go first.
[01:16:24.502 --> 01:16:31.729]  I just had someone close to me commit suicide, so I don't wish that on anyone, but I mean this business that somehow we need to become extinct to save the planet is asinine.
[01:16:32.776 --> 01:16:36.017]  Well, it looks like she watched too many Maleficent cartoons or something.
[01:16:36.057 --> 01:16:37.837]  Or Little Mermaid Witch.
[01:16:38.757 --> 01:16:41.138]  No, I think when she was, you know, who do you want to be when you grow up?
[01:16:41.298 --> 01:16:44.198]  I think she was looking for Cruella de Vil.
[01:16:44.318 --> 01:16:45.479]  That was who she wanted to be.
[01:16:45.539 --> 01:16:48.639]  And that's what Cruella de Vil would be like if she were a Ph.D.
[01:16:48.779 --> 01:16:49.219]  academic.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:56.881]  If I sent my kid off to college and he sent me home a report that this is what he taught, I think I'd ask for my tuition money back.
[01:16:57.361 --> 01:16:59.982]  I was about to say, she's got a pentagram on her hip.
[01:17:00.142 --> 01:17:00.782]  Oh, you knew that.
[01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:04.863]  He's just another devil worshipper.
[01:17:05.624 --> 01:17:07.704]  Again, I just want her to go first.
[01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:11.905]  She's got to pour gasoline all over herself.
[01:17:12.966 --> 01:17:13.686]  Go easy, Alex.
[01:17:13.746 --> 01:17:16.367]  We're all in need of grace.
[01:17:16.447 --> 01:17:17.727]  She needs it more.
[01:17:18.047 --> 01:17:18.727]  Go easy.
[01:17:18.747 --> 01:17:19.728]  She wants us all to die.
[01:17:19.748 --> 01:17:20.848]  I'm just saying, let's go!
[01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:24.086]  You know that song from Elvis?
[01:17:24.486 --> 01:17:25.126]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:17:25.387 --> 01:17:27.608]  Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
[01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:29.108]  Let yourself go!
[01:17:29.528 --> 01:17:30.529]  My heart goes out to her.
[01:17:30.569 --> 01:17:31.629]  Come on, honey.
[01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:33.951]  You ain't got no place to go.
[01:17:34.231 --> 01:17:36.952]  Just put your arms around me real tight.
[01:17:38.833 --> 01:17:40.114]  There are many forms of death.
[01:17:43.135 --> 01:17:44.776]  Let's talk about Trump or politics.
[01:17:44.796 --> 01:17:46.937]  Let's talk about her putting gasoline all over her body.
[01:17:49.622 --> 01:17:51.582]  Norm, I misbehave when you're here.
[01:17:51.602 --> 01:17:53.063]  I hope she lives a long life.
[01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:53.843]  I hope she doesn't do that.
[01:17:53.863 --> 01:17:54.363]  It's dangerous.
[01:17:54.883 --> 01:17:57.604]  We don't want to harm a little hair on her little witch head.
[01:17:58.024 --> 01:18:00.125]  All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[01:18:00.185 --> 01:18:01.605]  Some have fallen farther than others.
[01:18:01.725 --> 01:18:03.085]  She's taken a precipitous decline.
[01:18:03.105 --> 01:18:06.386]  Yeah, well, she's up there flapping around like a vampire bat, telling us to kill ourselves.
[01:18:06.426 --> 01:18:08.987]  I'm just simply saying, I just said kill yourself.
[01:18:10.027 --> 01:18:12.488]  Well, that's given her what she wants.
[01:18:13.328 --> 01:18:16.208]  I think that the power of love and the power of grace is overwhelming.
[01:18:16.228 --> 01:18:18.449]  It certainly has transformed my life, and I hope it would her.
[01:18:19.426 --> 01:18:20.628]  Gasoline would too as well.
[01:18:23.452 --> 01:18:25.696]  Norm, I'm having a little bit of fun today.
[01:18:25.796 --> 01:18:28.600]  You got me and it takes a lot to make me speechless.
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:29.541]  You have that gift.
[01:18:31.204 --> 01:18:33.587]  You've been here a few times where I've gone a little crazy on air.
[01:18:34.884 --> 01:18:36.665]  You've rendered me speechless more than once.
[01:18:36.765 --> 01:18:39.727]  And you got Roger Stone lovingly looking over your shoulder?
[01:18:40.107 --> 01:18:41.108]  Oh, Roger, Roger.
[01:18:41.128 --> 01:18:43.730]  I think his sentencing will be postponed next week.
[01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:49.293]  Enough questions have arisen about a tainted jury, and then the shenanigans with the prosecutors.
[01:18:49.594 --> 01:18:51.515]  I think his sentencing should be postponed while the dust settles.
[01:18:56.235 --> 01:19:04.041]  That's the jurisprudence thing, and I agree with you from your perspective, but Trump is about to pardon him and piss in the face of the establishments.
[01:19:04.061 --> 01:19:04.601]  We need that.
[01:19:05.342 --> 01:19:09.885]  I mean, again, I'm a lawyer, so I'm always looking at what people can do within the rule of law.
[01:19:09.905 --> 01:19:10.726]  He has that right.
[01:19:10.826 --> 01:19:13.528]  No, I think Judge Jackson will probably do it just to change the subject.
[01:19:14.155 --> 01:19:14.996]  We'll do what, sentence him?
[01:19:15.716 --> 01:19:16.597]  No, postpone it.
[01:19:16.877 --> 01:19:17.698]  Well, I mean, she should.
[01:19:17.778 --> 01:19:20.621]  I mean, he's entitled to fair and impartial proceedings.
[01:19:20.681 --> 01:19:24.644]  And right now there's a climate of hysteria that's descended across Washington as to him.
[01:19:25.085 --> 01:19:27.687]  And I don't think he can get a fair and impartial proceeding right now.
[01:19:27.707 --> 01:19:29.969]  There are too many questions about what's gone on and why.
[01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:30.950]  But let's wait.
[01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:32.531]  What's the rush to justice?
[01:19:32.591 --> 01:19:33.492]  There need be no rush.
[01:19:35.179 --> 01:19:38.760]  You know, when somebody says we should kill humanity, I do have a problem with them.
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:39.840]  I do too.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.241]  And, you know, I'd like to know more about her.
[01:19:43.281 --> 01:19:47.401]  I've heard about these people before and these sort of death cults.
[01:19:47.781 --> 01:19:49.042]  I simply don't understand it.
[01:19:49.922 --> 01:19:51.302]  I just don't wish death on anyone.
[01:19:51.342 --> 01:19:54.583]  I mean, it comes to all of us and too soon no one gets out of here alive.
[01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:59.364]  The fact that she's trying to rush the process and wishing it on me, obviously I'm not feeling the love towards her.
[01:19:59.404 --> 01:20:01.044]  She's like a baby vampire bat.
[01:20:01.769 --> 01:20:06.473]  Well, you know, I mean, people make comments about me and my hair, so I'm not going to comment on her hair.
[01:20:06.493 --> 01:20:09.636]  Well, you don't look like, at least Elvira looked good with that haircut.
[01:20:09.696 --> 01:20:11.338]  She's not my type, you know.
[01:20:12.299 --> 01:20:13.079]  She's not your type?
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:13.700]  I'll say that.
[01:20:14.921 --> 01:20:16.563]  Well, she's gotten her 15 minutes of fame.
[01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:20.987]  But remember, she's preying on people at that college with all her Medusa wear and all the rest of this.
[01:20:21.027 --> 01:20:24.250]  And I'm just saying, she's par for the course with like little Greta Thunberg.
[01:20:25.371 --> 01:20:27.353]  I think what's happening, a little demonic chicken runs around.
[01:20:27.995 --> 01:20:32.620]  You know, I think what's happened in the last couple centuries is that we've had a crisis in our ideals.
[01:20:33.241 --> 01:20:36.584]  We've taken the... Yeah, we got a bunch of death-loving slugs running around running things.
[01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:44.933]  We've taken pluralism perhaps a little too seriously and we're afraid to call BS BS and I think what she's spouting is BS and you're right to call her on it.
[01:20:44.953 --> 01:20:48.898]  Yeah, I mean, she's like one of Count Dracula's brides or something.
[01:20:49.827 --> 01:20:53.228]  I mean, don't tell me if you didn't bring her a baby, she wouldn't just bite right in.
[01:20:53.288 --> 01:20:57.349]  I mean, all I'm just saying is these people should be rejected completely.
[01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:59.570]  She has no business teaching at a public college.
[01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:00.551]  No, she doesn't.
[01:21:00.611 --> 01:21:03.171]  She should be at a mental institution.
[01:21:03.211 --> 01:21:08.053]  In a society in which we are unable to distinguish better from worse, any nonsense will do.
[01:21:08.293 --> 01:21:10.774]  And so this is now being taught in a public university.
[01:21:10.854 --> 01:21:13.395]  That is the pluralism taken to an extreme.
[01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:15.115]  Not all ideas are worthwhile.
[01:21:15.135 --> 01:21:16.816]  There is such a thing as human excellence.
[01:21:17.216 --> 01:21:19.437]  The commitment of the human race should be to human flourishing.
[01:21:19.537 --> 01:21:21.878]  Calling for our extinction is inconsistent with that.
[01:21:22.838 --> 01:21:24.079]  She's got a problem with it.
[01:21:24.119 --> 01:21:27.660]  And with all the quote, Emperor Palpatine, no, no, no, you will die.
[01:21:28.361 --> 01:21:30.041]  Let's go ahead and take a caller here.
[01:21:30.441 --> 01:21:32.142]  Who's been holding the longest for Norm Pettis?
[01:21:34.423 --> 01:21:41.546]  That would be... That's kind of a fun noise.
[01:21:42.266 --> 01:21:45.127]  That's inside her head.
[01:21:45.247 --> 01:21:46.488]  Let's tune into what's going on in her head.
[01:21:47.864 --> 01:21:53.289]  Sounds like a soundtrack from The Exorcist, you know?
[01:21:53.529 --> 01:21:54.270]  Sorry.
[01:21:54.350 --> 01:22:00.015]  Steve in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:22:00.195 --> 01:22:01.536]  Long time listener.
[01:22:03.098 --> 01:22:09.243]  Seven and a half years in a prison, federal prison, and locked up with people who was
[01:22:10.472 --> 01:22:10.813]  I think so.
[01:22:24.384 --> 01:22:27.705]  Before I get started, I just want to let you know, this is your top three products.
[01:22:27.745 --> 01:22:30.947]  The VasoBeats, I had a four-pack in my ass, now I've got a six-pack.
[01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:33.748]  The Iodine, I take the X2 and X3.
[01:22:34.228 --> 01:22:39.871]  I know why they put the fluoride in the water, because your pituitary gland or your third eye connects you to the infinite creator.
[01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:40.371]  Exactly.
[01:22:40.391 --> 01:22:43.593]  They do that, it's calcified, then they suck you in on the phone.
[01:22:43.633 --> 01:22:47.014]  If people think they're getting smarter from the phone, their phone's sucking your information.
[01:22:47.455 --> 01:22:49.916]  My first product has to be the coffee in the water.
[01:22:49.956 --> 01:22:52.297]  I give people that water and coffee and they can't believe it.
[01:22:53.310 --> 01:23:00.900]  Um, as I said, I was at the, uh, the closing statement for the Rogers Stone trial and you were asking, you didn't hear the transcript?
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:01.841]  No, no, I didn't.
[01:23:02.984 --> 01:23:03.804]  Yeah, he was shifted.
[01:23:03.824 --> 01:23:08.025]  He asked him, he said, did you have any contact emails with this third party?
[01:23:08.305 --> 01:23:10.206]  He's like, I'm here for the Russian investigation.
[01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:12.146]  I had no contact dealing with Russian.
[01:23:12.426 --> 01:23:13.987]  They asked him the same question again.
[01:23:14.107 --> 01:23:14.907]  And he said it again.
[01:23:14.927 --> 01:23:19.588]  He asked the same question again and wrote and said, finally, Jones said, I didn't have any contact.
[01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:20.448]  And then he moved on.
[01:23:20.748 --> 01:23:24.969]  And then what they did was you see from a whole year, he had over 4,000 contacts with them.
[01:23:25.289 --> 01:23:28.050]  So they spun it that way for the jury tampering.
[01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:33.695]  Oh yeah, they make it all about proving Russiagate through Roger, even though the indictment has nothing to do with Russia.
[01:23:55.734 --> 01:24:02.077]  Well, one thing that appellate lawyers will look at in the Stone case is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.
[01:24:02.457 --> 01:24:04.798]  The sufficiency of the evidence test goes something like this.
[01:24:05.218 --> 01:24:11.861]  If in the record as a whole there's evidence that any reasonable juror could believe that is consistent with guilt, then he loses.
[01:24:12.241 --> 01:24:16.743]  If it's as you say it is, that this was not even a close call, that verdict will be set aside.
[01:24:16.883 --> 01:24:19.424]  Unfortunately, it looks like he's going to have to take that appeal.
[01:24:21.138 --> 01:24:26.440]  But President Trump's gonna... Yeah, but when he does that, that ends the discussion right there.
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:29.801]  He has an absolute... Yeah, yeah, yeah, relentless.
[01:24:29.821 --> 01:24:30.881]  Hold on, we'll be right back.
[01:24:31.141 --> 01:24:31.541]  Stay there.
[01:24:31.601 --> 01:24:32.402]  Don't hang up, Stephen.
[01:24:32.422 --> 01:24:33.362]  You had more you wanted to say.
[01:24:34.162 --> 01:24:39.924]  And then we're gonna continue broadcasting forward with another special guest that I've yet not announced.
[01:24:41.424 --> 01:24:45.606]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:45.626 --> 01:24:46.686]  Norm Pattis is here with us.
[01:24:47.466 --> 01:24:49.127]  Stephen Flory, you had one other point you wanted to make.
[01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:49.447]  Go ahead.
[01:24:50.815 --> 01:24:52.277]  Just two other points in the question.
[01:24:52.517 --> 01:24:55.760]  Just to let you know, I was in the overflow jury for Roger Stone.
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.121]  Really?
[01:24:57.461 --> 01:24:59.903]  And the prosecution gives their statement.
[01:25:00.524 --> 01:25:04.047]  And then when Roger Stone's attorney came up, his microphone was turned off.
[01:25:04.087 --> 01:25:05.568]  You couldn't even hear a word he said.
[01:25:05.648 --> 01:25:10.933]  And then when the prosecution goes up again to give the second thing, their microphone was turned way high.
[01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:12.895]  I'm like, it was purposely turned off.
[01:25:13.215 --> 01:25:16.258]  And the other thing is that on the day of deliberation,
[01:25:16.963 --> 01:25:18.364]  One of the jurors was sick.
[01:25:18.744 --> 01:25:19.404]  It's funny.
[01:25:19.764 --> 01:25:23.526]  The judge was like, oh, you know, this jury couldn't make it for the last day.
[01:25:23.566 --> 01:25:27.368]  I bet you that was the juror that couldn't be compromised to go the other way.
[01:25:27.428 --> 01:25:28.889]  So that's something you might want to look at.
[01:25:28.949 --> 01:25:32.791]  Yeah, that was the old lady that was bleeding in the hallway.
[01:25:32.871 --> 01:25:35.152]  It was something, but it was odd that the last day.
[01:25:35.472 --> 01:25:39.254]  But my question is, I've been behind bars and
[01:25:39.933 --> 01:25:43.338]  Would it have been better for Roger Stone to represent himself?
[01:25:43.678 --> 01:25:43.859]  Yes.
[01:25:43.899 --> 01:25:47.664]  Maybe even, you know, maybe even say, you know, temporary insanity.
[01:25:48.545 --> 01:25:50.448]  I don't know because, you know.
[01:25:51.254 --> 01:25:53.575]  Well, given the results, it couldn't have been much worse, right?
[01:25:53.595 --> 01:25:55.776]  I mean, seven to nine years for nominal offenses.
[01:25:55.816 --> 01:25:59.317]  I mean, serious offenses, which if sustainable, you know, is a problem.
[01:25:59.658 --> 01:26:00.778]  But there's a maxim in the law.
[01:26:00.798 --> 01:26:01.839]  I'm sure you heard it from folks.
[01:26:01.899 --> 01:26:04.600]  A person who represents themselves as a fool for a client.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.320]  Courtrooms are stressful places.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.541]  There's a lot to the law.
[01:26:07.941 --> 01:26:10.922]  My conviction is in 90% of cases, the lawyer doesn't matter.
[01:26:11.443 --> 01:26:13.463]  The case is going to work out the way it's going to work out.
[01:26:13.864 --> 01:26:16.765]  In 10% of cases, lawyers do matter, and then you want a good lawyer.
[01:26:17.285 --> 01:26:21.646]  Roger's case sounds like a close case from what I'm hearing, and I'm sorry I didn't pay attention to it.
[01:26:22.146 --> 01:26:31.089]  As I said, my office is today arranging to get copies of the trial transcripts, and if it's as close a case as you say it is, he's probably got excellent grounds on appeal.
[01:26:31.369 --> 01:26:34.089]  But from what Alex is telling, he's not going to need it.
[01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:36.590]  Donald's going to... Trump's going to pardon him.
[01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:37.410]  He has to do it.
[01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:38.190]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:26:39.031 --> 01:26:40.411]  All right, who's up next here?
[01:26:45.734 --> 01:26:47.275]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:26:51.277 --> 01:26:52.598]  From Greg in California.
[01:26:52.658 --> 01:26:53.259]  Greg, you're on the air.
[01:26:53.299 --> 01:26:53.599]  Go ahead.
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:55.640]  Wow.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:56.501]  Hello?
[01:26:56.901 --> 01:26:57.281]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:57.321 --> 01:26:57.601]  Go ahead.
[01:26:57.621 --> 01:26:57.661]  Hi.
[01:26:58.882 --> 01:27:01.003]  It's a real honor to talk to you.
[01:27:01.144 --> 01:27:04.706]  I really deeply appreciate your message, Alex.
[01:27:04.986 --> 01:27:05.886]  I appreciate you, brother.
[01:27:05.926 --> 01:27:06.287]  Go ahead.
[01:27:07.888 --> 01:27:10.349]  Well, you know, the Russia hoax is all hoax.
[01:27:10.789 --> 01:27:10.990]  And if
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:24.188]  A lawyer from, I mean, a police investigator goes and falsifies evidence in a trial, which is what they did, the Russia hoax.
[01:27:25.489 --> 01:27:32.174]  They throw all his, they throw it all out, and they also sometimes go after the guy that created it.
[01:27:32.194 --> 01:27:41.982]  So, why doesn't Trump go and, like, blanketly say that all of the convictions for the Russian investigation should be thrown out?
[01:27:42.947 --> 01:27:43.528]  Well, that's it.
[01:27:43.568 --> 01:27:47.012]  The Democrats are acting like he doesn't have that power, and that's another obstruction of justice.
[01:27:47.412 --> 01:27:48.494]  That's separation of powers.
[01:27:48.554 --> 01:27:49.915]  It's right there in the executive power.
[01:27:50.456 --> 01:27:58.686]  If the only check on that would be voters saying they think it's wrong, I don't think a presidential pardon could even be the product for another impeachment.
[01:27:58.726 --> 01:27:59.427]  Am I wrong, Norm?
[01:27:59.907 --> 01:28:05.590]  Well, I mean, given the standards, which is a race to the bottom, I don't know what obstruction of justice means in Congress's view.
[01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:09.411]  And a high crime and misdemeanor needn't be a crime, we learned, according to the Democrat theory.
[01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:15.554]  But if they disagree with the President's decision enough, they may gather the votes to impeach on political grounds.
[01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:21.957]  But if we have a second impeachment inquiry, it's going to end up the way the first one did, and it's going to play right into the Republicans' hands.
[01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:26.899]  But I think from Trump's perspective, bring it on, let's have the election, I think he's feeling pretty confident about 2020.
[01:28:29.497 --> 01:28:29.977]  Good point.
[01:28:30.137 --> 01:28:30.798]  Thank you, Greg.
[01:28:31.238 --> 01:28:31.578]  All right.
[01:28:32.018 --> 01:28:38.582]  Norm, you're flying back into your abode there, my skull and bones, tomorrow.
[01:28:39.182 --> 01:28:44.145]  But definitely, when do you think you'll have some news on the Roger Stone transcript you're getting?
[01:28:44.525 --> 01:28:49.488]  Depending on whether they've already been prepared and we're ordering another copy, I could have them as soon as this weekend.
[01:28:49.568 --> 01:28:54.891]  Realistically, it's likely to be a couple weeks, but we'll ask for expedited copies and I'll report to you as soon as I have something to report.
[01:28:55.051 --> 01:28:55.552]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:55.572 --> 01:28:59.176]  More calls are coming up, and we have a special guest I'll announce on the other side.
[01:28:59.216 --> 01:29:01.778]  That's Norm Pattis, constitutional lawyer.
[01:29:01.798 --> 01:29:05.182]  There's a bunch of news we haven't hit yet as well, and your phone calls.
[01:29:05.703 --> 01:29:10.147]  McClatchy, the second largest newspaper in the country, just filed for bankruptcy.
[01:29:10.167 --> 01:29:15.173]  So the mainstream media helped censor everybody, and now they've made themselves obsolete.
[01:29:15.293 --> 01:29:16.074]  I told them that would happen.
[01:29:17.489 --> 01:29:25.094]  Back in November, former Trump advisor Roger Stone was convicted of several charges related to the now officially discredited Russia investigation.
[01:29:25.634 --> 01:29:35.680]  Prosecutors claim that Stone lied about communicating with a former stand-up comedian called Randy Credico, a man whose role in the story was so minor that it's already been lost to history.
[01:29:36.361 --> 01:29:44.306]  For this offense, prosecutors say Stone, who is 67 years old and has no criminal record, must spend up to nine years in prison.
[01:29:45.026 --> 01:29:50.388]  Now, for perspective on that sentence, the typical rapist in this country spends four years in prison.
[01:29:50.768 --> 01:29:52.208]  Armed robbers, three years.
[01:29:52.649 --> 01:29:55.369]  Thugs who commit violent assault, less than a year and a half.
[01:29:55.810 --> 01:29:59.991]  But Roger Stone must do nine years until he is 76 years old for lying.
[01:30:02.972 --> 01:30:04.052]  Now there's some irony here.
[01:30:04.552 --> 01:30:07.913]  So-called criminal justice reform is fashionable in Washington right now.
[01:30:08.133 --> 01:30:14.354]  An awful lot of sex offenders and drug dealers and other predators, serious predators, have been released early from prison lately.
[01:30:14.834 --> 01:30:16.555]  It's compassionate, they're telling us.
[01:30:17.155 --> 01:30:18.695]  Yet somehow, nobody in D.C.
[01:30:18.735 --> 01:30:25.437]  believes that compassion ought to extend to Roger Stone, who's guilty of non-violent, essentially political offenses.
[01:30:25.777 --> 01:30:26.717]  Notice the opposite.
[01:30:27.097 --> 01:30:31.778]  The usual moralizers seem gleeful at the thought that Stone will die in a cell.
[01:30:32.498 --> 01:30:34.900]  CNN has been especially ghoulish on the subject.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:45.888]  You'll remember that prosecutors tipped off Jeff Zucker's network last year so they could have cameras in place when dozens of federal agents armed with automatic weapons dragged Roger Stone from his home at dawn.
[01:30:46.448 --> 01:30:47.529]  Talk about state TV.
[01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:56.236]  For the last two days, the hyenas on CNN have been driven to hysteria by the thought that the Justice Department might reduce Roger Stone's sentence even by a day.
[01:30:57.441 --> 01:31:02.905]  It is clearly, utterly offensive to the rule of law.
[01:31:03.045 --> 01:31:04.946]  This is what sets this country apart.
[01:31:05.486 --> 01:31:07.828]  This is what a banana republic does.
[01:31:07.868 --> 01:31:09.469]  This is what a dictator does.
[01:31:09.829 --> 01:31:11.570]  It is outrageous.
[01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:15.133]  I hope people are infuriated by this.
[01:31:15.473 --> 01:31:20.016]  The reason they're doing it is slimy, sleazy, dirty,
[01:31:20.436 --> 01:31:24.677]  Roger Stone is somebody I hold in minimum high esteem.
[01:31:24.777 --> 01:31:27.318]  So I was not unhappy to see him get 7 to 9.
[01:31:27.378 --> 01:31:28.778]  But I didn't recognize Brooke.
[01:31:28.798 --> 01:31:30.239]  You didn't think that was too aggressive?
[01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:32.899]  I thought it was aggressive.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:35.540]  Wait a second.
[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:40.901]  Was that really John Dean telling you how happy he is that Roger Stone will die in jail?
[01:31:41.741 --> 01:31:47.263]  So CNN's moral arbiter on questions of law and order is literally a convicted felon?
[01:31:48.348 --> 01:31:49.429]  It's enough to make your head spin.
[01:31:49.909 --> 01:31:52.332]  But at least it's now clear what's actually going on.
[01:31:52.672 --> 01:31:54.834]  This is a pure political hit.
[01:31:55.374 --> 01:31:59.678]  Roger Stone is facing prison because he is a high-profile Donald Trump supporter.
[01:32:00.138 --> 01:32:00.879]  It's that simple.
[01:32:01.139 --> 01:32:01.680]  You want proof?
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:02.320]  Here it is.
[01:32:02.821 --> 01:32:05.403]  John Brennan and James Clapper will sleep at home tonight.
[01:32:05.823 --> 01:32:10.808]  Both have been caught lying under oath on camera about matters of national importance.
[01:32:11.208 --> 01:32:12.369]  And yet, neither's in jail.
[01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:13.730]  Neither's been indicted.
[01:32:14.051 --> 01:32:15.012]  Neither ever will be.
[01:32:16.035 --> 01:32:20.397]  The Stone case, by contrast, was transparently political from day one.
[01:32:20.957 --> 01:32:25.019]  The lead prosecutor, Andrew Weissman, is now literally an MSNBC contributor.
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:35.944]  The judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, is an out-of-control Democratic partisan who purely out of spite stripped Roger Stone of his First Amendment rights and prevented him from making a living.
[01:32:36.265 --> 01:32:37.465]  Coming on this show, for example.
[01:32:37.565 --> 01:32:38.566]  Speaking it all in public.
[01:32:39.286 --> 01:32:45.175]  Now Stone and his wife, who is 71 years old and deaf, have lost their home because of this.
[01:32:45.215 --> 01:32:46.117]  They have no insurance.
[01:32:46.377 --> 01:32:47.339]  They're utterly broke.
[01:32:48.697 --> 01:32:51.359]  The whole thing is shocking, and it's disgusting.
[01:32:51.739 --> 01:32:54.862]  It's a farce that discredits the entire American justice system.
[01:32:55.522 --> 01:32:56.823]  The President seems to understand that.
[01:32:57.464 --> 01:33:00.246]  Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice, he tweeted recently.
[01:33:00.266 --> 01:33:02.608]  He's right, on a couple of levels.
[01:33:03.168 --> 01:33:05.350]  What's happening to Roger Stone is totally wrong.
[01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:07.592]  It's immoral, and we should not allow it in this country.
[01:33:08.172 --> 01:33:10.094]  But politically, it has significance too.
[01:33:10.754 --> 01:33:18.197]  Stone's prosecution was designed in part to confirm the fantasies that Democrats have constructed to explain the outcome of the 2016 election.
[01:33:18.777 --> 01:33:20.778]  His conviction helps their case.
[01:33:20.798 --> 01:33:29.482]  In other words, if the Russia collusion story was a hoax, and of course it most certainly was a hoax, then why is Roger Stone going to prison for his role in it?
[01:33:30.662 --> 01:33:36.544]  If Roger Stone serves even a single day behind bars, the Russia lie will be validated as true.
[01:33:37.505 --> 01:33:39.986]  Stone's imprisonment will be prima facie evidence.
[01:33:40.731 --> 01:33:41.752]  In the view of Democrats.
[01:33:42.533 --> 01:33:44.574]  So at this point, there's really only one solution.
[01:33:44.975 --> 01:33:49.939]  The President must pardon Roger Stone or commute his sentence before he goes to jail.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.281]  Democrats will howl if he does that.
[01:33:52.441 --> 01:33:53.482]  Well, they're howling anyway.
[01:33:53.522 --> 01:33:54.383]  They howl every day.
[01:33:54.683 --> 01:33:58.607]  Chuck Schumer is now yelping about yet another investigation into Roger Stone.
[01:33:58.847 --> 01:33:59.427]  Russiagate 2!
[01:34:01.266 --> 01:34:09.771]  In one entirely constitutional act, the president could save Roger Stone's life, vindicate himself, and end this nonsense forever.
[01:34:10.331 --> 01:34:11.092]  Let's hope he does it.
[01:34:11.292 --> 01:34:11.932]  We'll be watching.
[01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:13.173]  Alright.
[01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:29.162]  I don't normally play whole Tucker Carlson segments, but he's the Babe Ruth of populist, nationalist television, and we're really blessed that he finally has freedom at Fox, do what he wants, so we can see the real
[01:34:30.435 --> 01:34:30.836]  I don't know.
[01:34:48.254 --> 01:34:51.477]  And I can tell you, as soon as they figured out that Tucker knew about it, they backed off real quick.
[01:34:51.537 --> 01:34:56.141]  So, that'll really make you like somebody, too, when they're keeping you out of prison for things you haven't done.
[01:34:56.662 --> 01:34:58.624]  But yeah, they've been breathing down my neck.
[01:34:58.884 --> 01:35:01.826]  And I don't say that to go, oh look, I'm under attack.
[01:35:01.846 --> 01:35:03.208]  You can turn the news on and see that.
[01:35:03.828 --> 01:35:05.670]  I say that to say, I'm innocent.
[01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:07.492]  Everyone knows I'm innocent.
[01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:09.253]  I have nothing to do with the Russians.
[01:35:10.254 --> 01:35:13.996]  The Russians are incompetent running their own country, just like we are in many respects.
[01:35:15.437 --> 01:35:16.297]  It's a canard.
[01:35:17.018 --> 01:35:17.758]  It's a red herring.
[01:35:18.098 --> 01:35:21.280]  The problem is the out-of-control bureaucracy that we face.
[01:35:22.001 --> 01:35:26.763]  All right, for the rest of the hour, then I'm going to host someone at the fourth hour and cover all the other news.
[01:35:26.923 --> 01:35:27.964]  Styx joins us.
[01:35:28.584 --> 01:35:30.966]  And I've been watching this guy for six, seven, eight years on
[01:35:31.866 --> 01:35:35.332]  YouTube, he's got billions of views racked up there.
[01:35:35.353 --> 01:35:37.997]  He's an author, editor, video creator, and gardener.
[01:35:38.699 --> 01:35:41.323]  And he goes by Stick666Official.
[01:35:41.884 --> 01:35:43.227]  And I think that's...
[01:35:44.244 --> 01:35:48.966]  You know, just more of an obnoxious handle, but he could describe that for you if he wishes.
[01:35:48.986 --> 01:35:52.327]  In fact, even if he was a devil worshiper, which I don't think he is, at least he comes on the show.
[01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:54.348]  No other leftist will even come on the show.
[01:35:54.388 --> 01:35:56.809]  I don't want to describe him as a leftist, maybe an anarchic capitalist.
[01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.769]  I'm not sure.
[01:35:57.809 --> 01:36:01.931]  Maybe he should describe himself for us, but he joins us now.
[01:36:02.251 --> 01:36:03.191]  I want to just get him on.
[01:36:03.211 --> 01:36:05.132]  He's been on with Paul before, and Paul's hosted.
[01:36:05.472 --> 01:36:10.714]  Just to give his commentary on where we are, because I don't want to overdo this, but let me tell you.
[01:36:11.434 --> 01:36:12.715]  Epstein was a big wake-up.
[01:36:13.376 --> 01:36:15.237]  The Russiagate falling apart was a big wake-up.
[01:36:15.637 --> 01:36:26.045]  This Roger Stone thing, I had people at the grocery store last night, this morning getting gas, just running up, going, I'm wrong, you're right, Roger and you were innocent, I used to be a liberal, I'm an idiot!
[01:36:26.685 --> 01:36:27.806]  I mean, this is big.
[01:36:28.006 --> 01:36:28.787]  This is big.
[01:36:29.107 --> 01:36:35.411]  And the calls to the office and everything, I think people really are waking up right now.
[01:36:35.511 --> 01:36:39.314]  Maybe I'm wrong, but something big is going on.
[01:36:39.374 --> 01:36:40.635]  Sticks, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:36:40.935 --> 01:36:49.401]  How would you describe yourself for new viewers or people that don't know who you are, sort of others defining you, some of your tongue-in-cheek stuff, and then what would you call the age we're in right now?
[01:36:51.118 --> 01:37:00.368]  I would call it a little bit of a dark age, but it's almost a little bit of a golden age as well, because we have the Trump presidency, we have a booming economy, there are plenty of things that are improving.
[01:37:00.868 --> 01:37:10.198]  My own views, they've shifted a little bit over the time, but pretty much remain the same, which is I was a liberal in the classical sense many, many years ago.
[01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:12.720]  I'm a libertarian, self-professed.
[01:37:13.301 --> 01:37:30.536]  There are some populistic beliefs that I hold, and then there are some beliefs that are more liberal, still definitely in form, and I think you probably fit into the same broad category, which is a person who can't be cookie-cuttered into the same sort of like little categories that the establishment really wants to put people in because it helps to control them.
[01:37:30.556 --> 01:37:30.896]  Precisely!
[01:37:30.936 --> 01:37:32.057]  I don't want to be put there.
[01:37:32.097 --> 01:37:32.738]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:37:33.775 --> 01:37:34.255]  Exactly.
[01:37:34.555 --> 01:37:41.517]  As far as the username goes, that actually dates back many, many years to when I was actually an atheistic Satanist.
[01:37:41.577 --> 01:37:43.157]  I left that behind long ago.
[01:37:43.898 --> 01:37:45.258]  I have nothing to do with it anymore.
[01:37:45.338 --> 01:37:47.639]  But the name stuck, so I just kept it the same.
[01:37:48.119 --> 01:37:48.839]  Sure, makes sense.
[01:37:49.679 --> 01:37:54.740]  So what would you... What's your prediction on what the left's going to do now?
[01:37:54.781 --> 01:37:56.441]  Because they're clearly self-destructing.
[01:37:57.970 --> 01:38:00.392]  Yeah, they're just completely blowing themselves up.
[01:38:00.452 --> 01:38:04.454]  I mean, look, Bernie Sanders was considered really far out in 2016.
[01:38:04.534 --> 01:38:09.497]  Now his little revolution shtick is getting old because there are people that are more extreme than he is.
[01:38:09.898 --> 01:38:12.800]  Booty Judge on certain issues, certainly.
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:14.200]  Bloomberg on guns.
[01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:17.362]  Probably the most far out person we can possibly think of.
[01:38:17.423 --> 01:38:21.185]  I mean, as one of Bernie Sanders' constituents, I'm actually from Vermont, which
[01:38:21.605 --> 01:38:22.506]  Some people don't know.
[01:38:22.987 --> 01:38:26.671]  Bernie Sanders has been doing the tired hack thing for a very, very long time.
[01:38:26.711 --> 01:38:29.554]  He's literally been in politics since the Carter administration.
[01:38:31.696 --> 01:38:33.398]  And everything he touches, he swindles.
[01:38:34.739 --> 01:38:35.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:36.822 --> 01:38:39.104]  He's a little bit of a snake oil salesman, ultimately.
[01:38:40.105 --> 01:38:41.066]  I've got a lot of questions.
[01:38:41.086 --> 01:38:42.127]  We're going to break in 20 seconds.
[01:38:42.187 --> 01:38:43.489]  What do you want to cover when we come back?
[01:38:44.835 --> 01:38:54.043]  We can talk anything politics, a little bit of coronavirus maybe, and the weakness of the Democratic field definitely would be like the issue of the day after the disaster that was Iowa.
[01:38:54.663 --> 01:38:55.184]  Absolutely.
[01:38:55.204 --> 01:38:56.965]  That's exactly where I'm going with Sticks.
[01:38:57.806 --> 01:39:07.213]  And again, we'll put it up on screen where you can find him on Twitter, Sticks666official and SticksHexHammer666.
[01:39:08.014 --> 01:39:09.355]  Hug the cobra.
[01:39:10.136 --> 01:39:11.437]  Kiss the cobra.
[01:39:12.598 --> 01:39:13.639]  Love the cobra.
[01:39:15.322 --> 01:39:16.623]  Have a little bit of fun here, folks.
[01:39:16.703 --> 01:39:21.428]  Sticks, a very popular author, researcher on YouTube and other platforms, is here with us.
[01:39:22.068 --> 01:39:25.071]  And I wanted to get him on because I watch a lot of his videos.
[01:39:25.091 --> 01:39:31.637]  He has really intelligent insights and makes me have original thoughts, which I don't have a lot, actually, listening to other people.
[01:39:32.618 --> 01:39:35.881]  I don't want to get too confident here, though, because there's a lot of big problems.
[01:39:35.901 --> 01:39:36.181]  You're right.
[01:39:36.201 --> 01:39:40.304]  It's like the Kali Yuga, if you believe the Hindus, the end of this big dark age.
[01:39:40.964 --> 01:39:48.370]  But at the end of the night, you kind of see the sun rising off in the distance, at least, you know, high up in the clouds before it even comes up over the horizon.
[01:39:49.471 --> 01:39:50.752]  You see those first rays.
[01:39:52.313 --> 01:39:56.716]  The left, the globalists everywhere are screwing the pooch and people are waking up to them.
[01:39:56.736 --> 01:39:58.598]  But there is that paradoxical view
[01:40:00.242 --> 01:40:09.069]  How would you describe the time we're alive right now and the microcosm of the Democrats in Iowa and everywhere else and what they're doing and where you see all this going?
[01:40:09.089 --> 01:40:13.073]  Because I don't want to be overconfident watching them destroy themselves.
[01:40:13.993 --> 01:40:15.915]  And then I ask, how are they going to strike back?
[01:40:15.955 --> 01:40:16.816]  What are they going to pull next?
[01:40:18.325 --> 01:40:23.107]  Yeah, being overconfident is never good, but ultimately I remain largely optimistic.
[01:40:23.227 --> 01:40:32.370]  I choose to believe that the average person in the world is fundamentally good and capable of governing their affairs and understands that corruption isn't a good thing.
[01:40:32.931 --> 01:40:46.396]  I like to believe that if they're presented with accurate information, which is what you are invested in, myself and many others, if they have the information, real true information on things, they will generally make decent decisions.
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:54.288]  What sets that sort of mentality apart from what we see among the Democrats is they don't believe in individuality in any real sense at this point.
[01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:56.811]  They've gone completely off kilter.
[01:40:57.192 --> 01:40:59.895]  They don't even know what they're talking about, but I don't think that they'll win.
[01:40:59.915 --> 01:41:01.797]  They're a classical death cult now, really, aren't they?
[01:41:01.817 --> 01:41:02.678]  A classical death cult.
[01:41:03.106 --> 01:41:05.687]  Yeah, in some respects, absolutely.
[01:41:05.827 --> 01:41:08.148]  I think that Trump is likely to win re-election.
[01:41:08.468 --> 01:41:10.469]  And I know Trump's not perfect by any means.
[01:41:10.529 --> 01:41:15.372]  He's been a moderate reformer, but he's trying and he is reforming things as opposed to the Democrats.
[01:41:16.312 --> 01:41:20.674]  Nothing says that the best answer to Donald Trump right now that they seem to have
[01:41:21.425 --> 01:41:29.331]  ...is a dude who's older than Trump, richer ironically, and a thousand times more corrupt than anything Trump could ever concoct, which is Michael Bloomberg.
[01:41:29.371 --> 01:41:33.394]  It looks like he might end up being their nominee inexplicably and not even be on the ballot.
[01:41:33.415 --> 01:41:37.598]  He's a real oligarch that made his 78 million off of rigged stock market stuff.
[01:41:38.646 --> 01:41:43.811]  Yeah, and he's not even on the ballot, I think, until Super Tuesday, or until, at least if I remember correctly, South Carolina.
[01:41:44.271 --> 01:41:52.578]  He hasn't even gotten a delegate because he wasn't even on the ballot before, and yet he's arguably their mainline frontrunner now, now that Biden's basically corrupt politically.
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:55.361]  Wow.
[01:41:57.222 --> 01:41:59.124]  Why did they try to force-feed Biden?
[01:41:59.204 --> 01:42:03.628]  He was so obviously, even six months ago, couldn't even put a sentence together.
[01:42:04.758 --> 01:42:17.895]  Yeah, and initially I figured that the basic idea of the DNC, at first I figured they wanted Biden just because he's easily controlled, he's predictable, he's already been in the White House, so he's obviously an establishmentarian in that sense.
[01:42:18.455 --> 01:42:23.702]  I figured that Elizabeth Warren was sort of their draw, their secondary, so that if he ever faltered,
[01:42:24.182 --> 01:42:33.434]  She would get the backing, but now it looks like Michael Bloomberg may have even, ironically enough, he may have outmaneuvered the DNC because they basically have a steward leader.
[01:42:33.774 --> 01:42:35.256]  They're a party without a king.
[01:42:35.656 --> 01:42:37.839]  Their figurehead leader is Tom Perez.
[01:42:38.099 --> 01:42:39.481]  He's back in the shadows.
[01:42:39.541 --> 01:42:42.405]  He never even makes public appearances or statements half the time.
[01:42:42.805 --> 01:42:43.346]  We're good to go.
[01:42:58.308 --> 01:43:00.608]  And he's even crazier than he was before.
[01:43:01.089 --> 01:43:14.391]  Oddly enough, though, this time he almost gets edged out because other people have taken aspects of far leftism, cannibalized them, like Warren with his entire platform, and actually made them even worse than the socialism he peddled all along.
[01:43:15.731 --> 01:43:19.132]  And I'm sure you've seen the footage of Warren in New Hampshire.
[01:43:19.212 --> 01:43:20.932]  I mean, no one wants to talk to her.
[01:43:21.292 --> 01:43:24.693]  And she's this creepy looking lady, man.
[01:43:24.713 --> 01:43:26.893]  I mean, these are creepozoids.
[01:43:28.144 --> 01:43:30.886]  I thought it was bad when she came in a fairly distant third in Iowa.
[01:43:30.906 --> 01:43:33.988]  It's like, well, you know, basically you're the third-wheel candidate.
[01:43:34.008 --> 01:43:35.809]  She can't even do that in New Hampshire.
[01:43:35.829 --> 01:43:39.031]  In New Hampshire, she was ahead a few months prior.
[01:43:39.551 --> 01:43:41.232]  She was number one in a couple of polls.
[01:43:41.292 --> 01:43:44.234]  She was actually the front-runner in a few polls.
[01:43:44.634 --> 01:43:47.776]  Booty Judge and Zend Sanders end up claiming the victory.
[01:43:47.816 --> 01:43:51.818]  Klobuchar comes out of nowhere, which I don't think anyone really expected.
[01:43:51.838 --> 01:43:54.660]  Not that she's viable long-term.
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:44:00.543]  It'd be very funny if Klobuchar and Warren ended up fighting over the same sort of identity politics block.
[01:44:00.563 --> 01:44:03.584]  And that's possible too, and that would make it a much more exciting race.
[01:44:04.024 --> 01:44:04.565]  Well, that's right.
[01:44:04.605 --> 01:44:08.006]  She attacked Joe Biden and said he hated women and all this stuff.
[01:44:08.466 --> 01:44:15.150]  And then she was giving a speech last night saying, we need to stop infighting in the Democratic Party and destroying ourselves from within.
[01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:20.292]  It's like whatever the inversion of reality is, they do it and they don't think people see it.
[01:44:21.556 --> 01:44:27.778]  Well, the problem is they've gotten themselves addicted to the heroine of tabloidism, so they've become the sensationalists now.
[01:44:28.238 --> 01:44:38.421]  And the thing is, they try to blame Trump and say, well, everything was all normal and all this stuff was only in the weekly world news, but then Trump is mainstreaming conspiracy theories and stuff.
[01:44:38.441 --> 01:44:39.621]  The Democrats have spent
[01:44:40.049 --> 01:44:45.236]  The last few years trying to tell us that our political system is being usurped by Boris and Natalia.
[01:44:46.177 --> 01:44:49.101]  That the Pink Panthers wandering around and things like that.
[01:44:49.281 --> 01:44:50.923]  They're living in a la-la land.
[01:44:51.244 --> 01:44:53.927]  And this is why, by the way, Bernie Sanders could end up doing it.
[01:44:53.967 --> 01:44:58.113]  Because if you've got a group of lunatics trying to vote on which lunatic to lead them off the cliff...
[01:44:58.633 --> 01:45:01.374]  Well, a natural choice would be Bernie Sanders.
[01:45:01.414 --> 01:45:03.456]  He's been doing it since the 1970s.
[01:45:03.816 --> 01:45:04.816]  He's the thoroughbred of it.
[01:45:05.196 --> 01:45:05.797]  And you're right.
[01:45:05.957 --> 01:45:10.559]  They don't get they've put themselves in their own alternate phantom zone universe.
[01:45:10.919 --> 01:45:15.522]  They keep saying that libertarians, nationalists, patriots, common sensors, that we're an echo chamber.
[01:45:15.802 --> 01:45:16.862]  We're out in the real world.
[01:45:16.882 --> 01:45:18.223]  I want to know what the public thinks.
[01:45:18.583 --> 01:45:24.226]  They literally should have focused group saying that a populist movement was run by the Russians.
[01:45:24.346 --> 01:45:25.707]  No one buys that crap.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:29.801]  Yeah, Trump was never an extremist or a fanatic anyway.
[01:45:29.841 --> 01:45:36.702]  The people who call him a fanatic are people who wear Che Guevara shirts and think that the USSR is a good honeymoon location.
[01:45:37.142 --> 01:45:44.284]  If you think that way, if you genuinely believe that, you know, whatever, then yeah, Trump begins to look extreme.
[01:45:44.324 --> 01:45:45.804]  But really, what's he arguing for?
[01:45:46.164 --> 01:45:47.444]  We staff our borders.
[01:45:47.724 --> 01:45:50.985]  Well, that's something that every president since Reagan has been promising.
[01:45:51.025 --> 01:45:53.126]  He's the only one to partially fulfill that goal.
[01:45:53.166 --> 01:45:55.006]  And that's something any liable country does.
[01:45:55.879 --> 01:45:56.339]  Exactly.
[01:45:56.399 --> 01:45:57.640]  Every other country does that.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:05.964]  Tax relief, which mainly affected the middle and working class as far as a ratio of tax relief to the amount actually earned.
[01:46:06.464 --> 01:46:08.045]  He's been a reformist president.
[01:46:08.085 --> 01:46:09.005]  He hasn't done anything crazy.
[01:46:09.025 --> 01:46:11.987]  He actually raised taxes on me, who they call a rich guy.
[01:46:12.727 --> 01:46:18.030]  The taxes on people that actually went up, the cut was only for middle class and working class.
[01:46:19.090 --> 01:46:25.017]  Well, the Democrats would definitely raise it more because, you know, you see, you don't bribe senators, so it becomes a big problem.
[01:46:25.057 --> 01:46:27.080]  If you're like Bloomberg, though, they're not going to touch your money.
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:36.051]  Oh, he pays nothing, because they write the laws, just like Bezos, pays no tax, and then lectures everyone how the middle class isn't paying enough all day long.
[01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:40.992]  Yeah, yeah, it's insane to actually see what some of these proposals are.
[01:46:41.032 --> 01:46:49.955]  And then the real kicker, this is the funny part, like if you go around Twitter and stuff, you'll see Bernie Sanders fans especially pretending that he's not a socialist.
[01:46:50.035 --> 01:46:54.457]  Their new thing is they're scared that the label socialism is turning off independent voters.
[01:46:54.817 --> 01:46:58.118]  So they say, no, no, no, he's not actually a socialist, he's a social democrat.
[01:46:58.158 --> 01:46:59.419]  And then when you confront them,
[01:46:59.779 --> 01:47:03.924]  With footage of Sanders calling himself a socialist, they say, well, he's just wrong.
[01:47:04.224 --> 01:47:06.106]  He's wrong about his own ideology.
[01:47:06.126 --> 01:47:10.892]  He's been lying since the 1970s, and he's not actually a one true socialist.
[01:47:10.952 --> 01:47:14.095]  It's a total fallacy, and it's the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[01:47:14.476 --> 01:47:17.219]  And the praising of it as well, you know, like you said, the problem is 18.
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:18.640]  I think so.
[01:47:42.148 --> 01:47:43.288]  We reach new people is you.
[01:47:43.989 --> 01:47:45.889]  And so, you are the entire broadcast.
[01:47:45.909 --> 01:47:48.830]  You're everything, and we're just here at your sufferance, so spread the word.
[01:47:49.971 --> 01:47:51.371]  All right, Styx is our guest.
[01:47:52.852 --> 01:47:57.314]  Fourth hour's coming up with myself and Matt Bracken, and for callers patiently holding, I'll get to you in the interview.
[01:47:57.334 --> 01:47:58.114]  You can hang out and call back.
[01:47:58.174 --> 01:47:58.994]  I really appreciate you.
[01:48:00.095 --> 01:48:05.197]  Styx is a commentator, author, video creator, and gardener, and he's on with us right now.
[01:48:05.217 --> 01:48:08.498]  You know, I want to be confident, Styx,
[01:48:10.234 --> 01:48:15.276]  That we can turn things around, and I do see some positive things, but I want to make sure it's not a dead cat bounce.
[01:48:16.476 --> 01:48:30.001]  When we have the Democratic Party and big foundations in Europe teaching inherently that white people are bad, obviously that's meant to invoke racial division, just like a warden in a prison wants to control things by race.
[01:48:30.981 --> 01:48:38.224]  And these videos come out almost daily, and I don't normally get to them, but this is University of Virginia.
[01:48:39.986 --> 01:48:47.756]  With a woman coming to the new diversity campus area, you've probably already seen it, and saying, white people, there's too many of you, you need to leave.
[01:48:47.796 --> 01:48:49.759]  Well, this isn't a fake video.
[01:48:49.799 --> 01:48:50.840]  They confirm it's real.
[01:48:51.461 --> 01:48:52.722]  This is what goes on.
[01:48:53.567 --> 01:48:56.229]  Now, what it really is, is like Caddyshack elitism.
[01:48:56.269 --> 01:48:58.531]  Judge Schmell saying you're not welcome here at the golf course.
[01:48:59.252 --> 01:49:01.233]  This is what tribalism is, is an elitism.
[01:49:01.273 --> 01:49:07.158]  But if you're part of the university, you're there, you're enrolled, you're paying money, you have a right, whether you're black or white or whatever, to go anywhere.
[01:49:07.198 --> 01:49:18.807]  But the fact that the left hasn't just abandoned common sense American reforms, but has inverted them and then claims the moral high ground boggles the mind.
[01:49:19.308 --> 01:49:22.510]  But they're doing it because they believe this is the venom that will bring us down.
[01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:23.011]  Here's the clip.
[01:49:25.336 --> 01:49:27.297]  Public service announcement!
[01:49:28.177 --> 01:49:29.098]  Excuse me!
[01:49:29.518 --> 01:49:36.282]  If y'all didn't know, this is the MSC, and frankly, there's just too many white people in here, and this is a space for people of color.
[01:49:36.602 --> 01:49:44.586]  So just be really cognizant of the space that you're taking up, because it does make some of us POCs uncomfortable when we see too many white people in here.
[01:49:44.626 --> 01:49:51.790]  It's only been open for four days, and frankly, there's the whole university for a lot of y'all to be at, and there's very few spaces for us.
[01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:53.350]  So keep that in mind.
[01:49:53.751 --> 01:49:54.131]  Thank you.
[01:49:57.133 --> 01:50:02.200]  And then everyone like cult members, because that's what it is, virtue signals, that they agree with it.
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:07.687]  I mean, you could talk for a hundred hours, I'm sure, just about that clip that is not isolated.
[01:50:09.153 --> 01:50:11.434]  Yeah, no, there's definitely a lot of that going on.
[01:50:11.534 --> 01:50:18.616]  One thing I'd point out, though, is that this is a far-left university, and this is the multiculturalism sort of student resource thing.
[01:50:18.977 --> 01:50:23.538]  The people that are going to be there are going to cheer for that sort of racism, and that's really what it is.
[01:50:23.578 --> 01:50:33.762]  And they're also the same small but very, very vocal and sometimes quite violent minority of people who have no problem with becoming violent and who also would say,
[01:50:34.542 --> 01:50:37.004]  That like only whites can be racist.
[01:50:37.444 --> 01:50:39.125]  And we've heard that before.
[01:50:39.465 --> 01:50:41.767]  It's often within an academic setting.
[01:50:41.827 --> 01:50:46.369]  I would say the average even left-wing politician probably privately disagrees with that.
[01:50:46.409 --> 01:50:48.370]  They're just willing to use it as political fodder.
[01:50:48.771 --> 01:50:50.852]  One thing, though, I would ask somebody like that.
[01:50:50.912 --> 01:50:54.374]  Imagine that someone comes in like there's a mixed race couple.
[01:50:54.944 --> 01:50:58.026]  Uh, where you've got like, like some black person dating a white person.
[01:50:58.066 --> 01:51:02.449]  Would, would she say therefore that, you know, they have to say bye-bye to their loved one?
[01:51:02.969 --> 01:51:05.851]  Well, there's the, the naked and hideous racism of it.
[01:51:05.891 --> 01:51:08.033]  They wouldn't want to answer that question now, would they?
[01:51:09.234 --> 01:51:11.415]  It's just total gangster thuggism.
[01:51:11.515 --> 01:51:12.936]  Like, you talk about Nazis.
[01:51:13.336 --> 01:51:18.640]  The closest thing to the Nazis I've ever seen is the left saying, not just that you should have evergreen and so many others.
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.842]  Whites aren't allowed here this weekend.
[01:51:21.382 --> 01:51:22.663]  It's, it's just obnoxious.
[01:51:24.471 --> 01:51:25.792]  Well, they're also the book burners.
[01:51:25.832 --> 01:51:41.483]  You see what they're trying to do on the internet all too well with not just yourself, but many other people getting completely banned off of mainline tech platforms that should be functioning legally as platforms because they platform government services like the USGS or NOAA.
[01:51:41.863 --> 01:51:47.127]  Insofar as they're taxpayer funded for US citizens and US firms, it should all be equal.
[01:51:47.547 --> 01:51:50.109]  But they want to burn books in the literal sense.
[01:51:50.129 --> 01:51:51.970]  They've even gone after Amazon titles.
[01:51:52.438 --> 01:51:58.744]  They want to ban people from public events based on their race, based on their sexage, and so forth.
[01:51:59.705 --> 01:52:04.449]  At what point are we going to point out who's actually acting in a bigoted and uninclusive manner?
[01:52:04.509 --> 01:52:07.592]  It's the same people that ramble always about inclusivity.
[01:52:09.473 --> 01:52:12.936]  Because their whole world is about what color you are instead of what you actually stand for.
[01:52:12.956 --> 01:52:14.678]  And that's what's so dangerous.
[01:52:14.818 --> 01:52:16.039]  In fact, you mentioned that.
[01:52:16.099 --> 01:52:17.581]  Let's criticize Trump, at least I am.
[01:52:19.127 --> 01:52:24.692]  His head Justice Department lawyer came out in a Hollywood Reporter article yesterday and said, we're not going to go after big tech.
[01:52:24.792 --> 01:52:25.493]  It's their speech.
[01:52:25.533 --> 01:52:26.794]  They can control speech if they want.
[01:52:26.854 --> 01:52:29.897]  But as you said, Section 230, they're a utility.
[01:52:30.457 --> 01:52:33.380]  And to be watching us in live time is surveillance.
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:35.682]  And it's really election meddling.
[01:52:35.722 --> 01:52:42.087]  So I see Trump's biggest failing so far, other than not pardoning Assange, who he told released the WikiLeaks.
[01:52:42.948 --> 01:52:44.209]  is not standing up to this.
[01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:46.992]  This is far beyond what private companies are doing.
[01:52:47.052 --> 01:52:53.237]  It's organized, admitted, coordinated suppression of communications that's so dangerous.
[01:52:54.438 --> 01:52:57.180]  I would agree, and that's exactly why I support Alt-Tech.
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:03.205]  And by the way, congratulations, I believe InfoWars now approaching 63,000 subscribers on BitChute.
[01:53:03.405 --> 01:53:03.585]  Yes.
[01:53:03.605 --> 01:53:10.371]  Which is quite, you know, this is the sort of numbers that were unimaginable on some of these platforms even a couple of years ago.
[01:53:10.871 --> 01:53:15.716]  We had Vidme, we had other sites try to be competitors to sites like YouTube or Facebook or whatever.
[01:53:15.756 --> 01:53:28.209]  And let's remember though, Big Tech's constantly going after BitChute, constantly going after Gab, constantly trying to shut down any new platform, going after their banking, going after our banking, while they say, oh just build your own thing.
[01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:30.872]  We do build our own thing, and they come after us.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:35.784]  Yeah, well eventually you'll build enough things that they won't be able to come after you.
[01:53:35.824 --> 01:53:40.669]  It'll be just like the really early wave of the internet getting supplanted by these companies.
[01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:45.394]  They've become hegemonically powerful at the moment, but they can be supplanted.
[01:53:46.014 --> 01:53:48.197]  It's all about the people's will, right?
[01:53:48.697 --> 01:53:55.124]  If the people go patronize and just watch other people's platforms, it will move the power away from the system.
[01:53:56.052 --> 01:54:04.299]  Well, also these sites were formed by people that were edgy and taboo and swore a lot and did like all sorts of weird off-the-wall and sometimes violent and fanatic things.
[01:54:04.399 --> 01:54:07.702]  So wherever that sort of crowd gravitates towards is going to grow.
[01:54:08.182 --> 01:54:17.030]  And Alt-Tech, despite the fact that the reputation is partially unearned, because there's a lot of commentary like yours or mine there that's not fanatic, that's not violent,
[01:54:17.842 --> 01:54:22.624]  Where that sort of stuff is tends to be, especially where younger audiences will gravitate towards.
[01:54:22.684 --> 01:54:26.666]  And when they're trying to sanitize the internet, my goodness, what an impossible task.
[01:54:27.206 --> 01:54:30.268]  Because new sites will just crop up anytime one... No, you're right.
[01:54:30.348 --> 01:54:34.930]  They are absolutely following the one course that could extinct their hegemonic power.
[01:54:35.899 --> 01:54:36.961]  Mm-hmm, exactly.
[01:54:37.001 --> 01:54:42.249]  And I think part of me is sad about that because for many years I was just a YouTuber.
[01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:44.432]  I don't want to see it go the way of the dinosaur.
[01:54:44.453 --> 01:54:45.674]  I just wish that they would go back to the way they were.
[01:54:45.694 --> 01:54:46.015]  I totally agree.
[01:54:46.035 --> 01:54:46.816]  Why are they doing this?
[01:54:46.916 --> 01:54:47.738]  Why are they doing this?
[01:54:48.761 --> 01:54:58.345]  The internet would be perfect if they had just frozen time at 2016 and not gone any further and just ignored all of these censorship lovers who, at the end of the day, it's all about money.
[01:54:58.365 --> 01:55:01.086]  It has nothing to do with your political views.
[01:55:01.126 --> 01:55:01.506]  No, you're right.
[01:55:01.526 --> 01:55:11.830]  You notice as soon as they gave in to censorship, now Sacha Baron Cohen is on CNN saying, execute, arrest, and put in prison Mark Zuckerberg because he hasn't bowed enough.
[01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:15.732]  Don't they get like, once you give up the free speech defense, it's all over?
[01:55:17.150 --> 01:55:19.072]  Yeah, and these people want money.
[01:55:19.132 --> 01:55:33.583]  Initially they held corporate money, advertiser money, over the heads of YouTube and Zuckerberg, and they all took the bait, and they all started bowing down before censorship, and now they realize they're screwed, and now they have to fight back against the same group of people they were working with before.
[01:55:34.023 --> 01:55:36.765]  I almost have to feel sorry for some of these people.
[01:55:37.165 --> 01:55:41.589]  It's like they should have known better, and they didn't, and now Alt-Tech comes along to kick them in the butt.
[01:55:42.076 --> 01:55:50.821]  And then what about Sacha Baron Cohen makes all his money on super edgy comedy and now he literally says, let's arrest people we disagree with.
[01:55:51.281 --> 01:55:53.182]  He looks like Count Dracula or something.
[01:55:53.242 --> 01:55:54.003]  I mean, it's sick.
[01:55:55.017 --> 01:55:56.477]  How far the mighty have fallen!
[01:55:56.517 --> 01:56:08.401]  I seem to remember that his main claim to fame post-movies was dressing up as Bruno and descending from, what was it, during the Oscars or Emmys or something, from the ceiling, landing face-first in Eminem's lap, and I guess he was in on the joke.
[01:56:08.721 --> 01:56:15.983]  It's like two of the biggest shock jocks of their era teaming up for this, and then they've both gone completely soft.
[01:56:16.023 --> 01:56:16.903]  Eminem has too.
[01:56:17.783 --> 01:56:18.684]  He's sold out.
[01:56:18.804 --> 01:56:22.447]  It's really obnoxious, because it'd be one thing if he hadn't been Mr. Free Speech.
[01:56:22.907 --> 01:56:26.050]  But now he's like the Darth Vader of anti-free speech.
[01:56:26.110 --> 01:56:26.910]  It's disgusting.
[01:56:27.951 --> 01:56:31.714]  Yeah, and Bruno and Borat were both great movies, and now it's like, what's he done lately?
[01:56:31.754 --> 01:56:34.596]  He tried with The Dictator and it was all scripted and nobody liked it.
[01:56:35.777 --> 01:56:36.377]  Well, that's it.
[01:56:36.417 --> 01:56:40.280]  He did that cable show where he bashed free speech and nobody liked it.
[01:56:40.741 --> 01:56:43.443]  It's like, yeah dude, people don't like jerks.
[01:56:44.918 --> 01:56:48.421]  If he had just remained edgy, he'd probably still be making some good stuff, too.
[01:56:48.441 --> 01:56:53.326]  He could put it just on the internet, just on alt-tech, and make it a BitChute exclusive, or a library exclusive.
[01:56:53.346 --> 01:56:53.866]  So what happened?
[01:56:53.886 --> 01:56:55.868]  He started taking himself too seriously, or what?
[01:56:56.909 --> 01:56:57.650]  Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:56:57.690 --> 01:57:00.453]  A lot of these people, they get successful, and that's exactly what they do.
[01:57:00.493 --> 01:57:02.775]  And thank goodness you haven't, and others haven't.
[01:57:03.848 --> 01:57:06.270]  No, I take myself a lot less seriously now.
[01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:07.331]  I'd go crazy.
[01:57:08.653 --> 01:57:14.198]  These people, man, nothing against old people, but taking yourself too seriously is the biggest sign of dementia there is.
[01:57:14.638 --> 01:57:16.140]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:16.821]  Stay with us.
[01:57:19.375 --> 01:57:24.676]  All right, Styx, the popular author, researcher, TV personalities with us right now, smart guy.
[01:57:24.696 --> 01:57:26.617]  I'm gonna start the next hour, take your calls.
[01:57:26.637 --> 01:57:28.397]  I've been holding patiently and I really appreciate you.
[01:57:29.038 --> 01:57:30.338]  And then Matt Bracken takes over.
[01:57:31.078 --> 01:57:33.759]  I don't want to be overconfident here, so I keep going back to this point.
[01:57:35.599 --> 01:57:37.240]  How does Trump screw the pooch?
[01:57:40.261 --> 01:57:40.921]  How does he
[01:57:42.128 --> 01:57:43.089]  Let these people win.
[01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:44.429]  We know there's election fraud.
[01:57:44.469 --> 01:57:48.051]  We know they've got illegal aliens being registered to vote everywhere.
[01:57:48.091 --> 01:57:49.832]  And again, I don't just say this as a virtue signal.
[01:57:49.932 --> 01:57:52.133]  I'm not against people that want to come here and have a better life.
[01:57:52.533 --> 01:57:54.374]  But they're being used as a political tool.
[01:57:54.975 --> 01:57:57.016]  The Democrats admit they're betting on them.
[01:57:57.076 --> 01:57:57.936]  They control them.
[01:57:58.256 --> 01:58:00.397]  They almost all vote for Democrats because they bring them in.
[01:58:00.417 --> 01:58:01.398]  We have to oppose it.
[01:58:01.998 --> 01:58:05.580]  So, we've seen so many of their attacks fail.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:07.481]  I don't want to be overconfident.
[01:58:10.526 --> 01:58:15.369]  Like so many people we've seen, and I already said this to you three times, Sticks, but I go back to this.
[01:58:15.490 --> 01:58:17.411]  How does Trump lose?
[01:58:17.471 --> 01:58:24.736]  Because by talking about how Trump loses, we start talking about how we win and how he wins.
[01:58:24.796 --> 01:58:26.857]  Because I know the White House listens, I know Trump listens.
[01:58:27.538 --> 01:58:29.519]  What is Trump's chinks in the armor?
[01:58:29.559 --> 01:58:33.062]  What, like smog, what scales is he missing on his belly?
[01:58:34.662 --> 01:58:46.919]  Well, considering his approval rate within the Republican core and among, after the State of the Union as well, I think, increasingly independent voters, the chance really is not that high, I think, of failure.
[01:58:46.939 --> 01:58:52.266]  There's an outside chance for a few of the candidates, but the thing is, the Democratic primaries
[01:58:53.343 --> 01:59:16.730]  I lean so heavily to the left that it's so totally different than the general election that my guess is that probably they're going to nominate someone who's either extremely far left and unpalatable to the average voter, which would be Sanders, generally speaking, or somebody like Bloomberg, somebody who can't really capture the far left thing because the rest of the party has gone so far left.
[01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:23.200]  I think that barring health problems, which is always a possibility, we have to keep that in mind.
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:23.200]  73.
[01:59:24.162 --> 01:59:29.411]  Yeah, I mean Trump's not exactly a spring chicken, but barring health problems, and he seems to be in reasonably good health,
[01:59:30.172 --> 01:59:40.120]  And half the Dem field is older anyway, and their nominee is likely to be older, unless it's Booty Judge, in which case he's likely to be not even middle-aged yet, not that much older than I am.
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:43.562]  I think that Trump's pretty much gutted in the bag, actually.
[01:59:43.582 --> 01:59:48.626]  A bad economy could sink his presidential chances, but so many people... Which is what I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:59:48.906 --> 01:59:50.047]  Your view on the coronavirus?
[01:59:51.570 --> 01:59:58.054]  Yeah, I think the coronavirus could potentially cause economic problems, maybe not on the order that would stop Trump's re-election.
[01:59:59.014 --> 02:00:00.515]  I do see it becoming a problem.
[02:00:00.615 --> 02:00:04.417]  I've been advising people now for several weeks on every video update I do.
[02:00:04.978 --> 02:00:13.742]  Now is the time to do some basic preparations, getting a few weeks worth at least of food per person, purified water, iodized salt, and other things you might need.
[02:00:14.283 --> 02:00:18.005]  Not because of coronavirus itself, because the average person that gets it, they get better.
[02:00:18.525 --> 02:00:18.926]  We're good to go.
[02:00:33.889 --> 02:00:42.413]  And there's no food to be had unless you intend to go beg, borrow, and steal and go out, you know, and potentially get infected, by the way, by being in public anyway.
[02:00:42.954 --> 02:00:44.814]  You might be tough out of luck.
[02:00:45.115 --> 02:00:46.335]  You might have some problems.
[02:00:46.535 --> 02:00:56.020]  So it makes sense to have some, you know, just basically rice and beans, canned soup and a can opener, something basic that you can survive off of for a few weeks at a time at least.
[02:00:58.032 --> 02:01:03.715]  Alright, so we looked at, and I totally agree with what you're saying, we looked at how Trump could externally be defeated.
[02:01:04.435 --> 02:01:13.920]  But isn't it really his advisors, and if he goes the same route as trusting establishment people who lie to his face, that the biggest threat is if Trump isn't faithful?
[02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:18.205]  And if Trump doesn't do the right thing, I think that's the big issue for me.
[02:01:18.245 --> 02:01:22.350]  And how do we, if you agree with me Sticks, how do we then keep Trump faithful?
[02:01:22.890 --> 02:01:28.117]  How do we get him to finally do something about the suppression of speech, the racketeering, all these un-American things?
[02:01:28.157 --> 02:01:33.803]  Because I don't want to be so in love with Trump, because I want to be clear to everybody, I've been persecuted for supporting Trump.
[02:01:34.364 --> 02:01:36.307]  Okay, I get attacked for supporting him.
[02:01:36.367 --> 02:01:38.850]  I'm not going to attack him now because I want to get brownie points.
[02:01:39.331 --> 02:01:42.155]  I'm doing it because I want him to really do the right thing.
[02:01:42.175 --> 02:01:47.402]  I don't want to just go, oh, he's not Hillary, or he's not Sanders, so I'm going to bend over to what Trump's doing.
[02:01:48.183 --> 02:01:51.108]  Is it Trump, Trump's own worst enemy, and how do we keep him honest?
[02:01:52.677 --> 02:02:06.184]  Yeah, I think, and you pointed it out in the previous segment, something that's very important, which is that perhaps his biggest failing so far has been an unwillingness or an inability to address online censorship especially, but censorship in a more general sense.
[02:02:06.665 --> 02:02:15.850]  He's delegated it largely to his son, to Don Jr., who weighs in on it, and that's fine, and I do speculate that censorship will move in the other direction.
[02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:16.970]  Yeah, but we don't want a bone.
[02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.611]  We don't want a bone.
[02:02:17.631 --> 02:02:17.991]  We don't want talk.
[02:02:19.688 --> 02:02:20.188]  Exactly.
[02:02:20.248 --> 02:02:21.669]  He needs to take action on that.
[02:02:21.709 --> 02:02:22.650]  That is important.
[02:02:23.671 --> 02:02:26.292]  I would say that is definitely one of his bigger failings.
[02:02:26.573 --> 02:02:32.016]  Organically censorship, it looks like it will be on the skids, but that could be a big problem for Trump.
[02:02:32.256 --> 02:02:37.880]  Other than the economy, the pissing off his core fans with not tackling that issue is a problem because
[02:02:38.961 --> 02:02:45.005]  People who make their living online, especially in part or in whole, have a lopsided control, really, over information.
[02:02:45.025 --> 02:02:49.508]  But just the average person experiences being shadow banned or blocked because they put out a Trump meme.
[02:02:49.648 --> 02:02:53.031]  I mean, people physically get like they're being screwed here.
[02:02:54.535 --> 02:03:03.177]  And even different from that is, for every creator that's banned, they've got thousands or maybe even millions of fans that suffer as the result of that.
[02:03:03.677 --> 02:03:06.717]  That's, by the way, why censorship, I think, is already losing favor.
[02:03:06.777 --> 02:03:13.259]  I've seen people on the far left now calling out some of the corporate censorship, which is, to their credit, they're still far left.
[02:03:13.479 --> 02:03:15.519]  Well, let's face it, you've got your finger on the pulse.
[02:03:15.539 --> 02:03:16.259]  Everybody knows that.
[02:03:16.299 --> 02:03:17.199]  You've talked to a lot of folks.
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:18.480]  I agree.
[02:03:20.959 --> 02:03:24.230]  I'm seeing a major rejection of the censorship.
[02:03:24.892 --> 02:03:25.956]  Quantify that for folks.
[02:03:27.608 --> 02:03:35.632]  Yeah, well, what's happened is, and this was even last year, they banned a whole bunch of progressive pages actually on Facebook for botting and things of that nature.
[02:03:35.672 --> 02:03:39.875]  Now, the far left is not organically as popular, so they usually do things like that.
[02:03:40.395 --> 02:03:43.557]  But people who were organically part of that got pissed off anyway.
[02:03:43.597 --> 02:03:44.957]  I remember, what was the page?
[02:03:45.038 --> 02:03:49.260]  Copblock got banned, among others, for doxing and some other practices.
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.721]  And this has been cross-platform as well.
[02:03:51.881 --> 02:03:53.102]  I see a moment coming.
[02:03:53.502 --> 02:04:05.962]  In which elements of the left team up with the broader right and of course more libertarian segment of society to defeat tech censorship and part of that will be all tech simply by putting pressure on the mainline sites as well.
[02:04:06.638 --> 02:04:11.583]  Well, whatever tech company submits to the crowd's vision will dominate the planet.
[02:04:11.963 --> 02:04:14.786]  Which they don't get, like, you want to worry about who's going to take over?
[02:04:15.186 --> 02:04:18.049]  The tech company that empowers the people and gets behind them 100%?
[02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:26.417]  The will of humanity is so powerful that that company could get total dominance in just a year supporting speech.
[02:04:27.117 --> 02:04:28.078]  And they just don't even get it.
[02:04:28.118 --> 02:04:29.299]  I mean, take McClatchy.
[02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:31.500]  They do a lot of great work.
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:33.461]  They're bankrupt.
[02:04:33.481 --> 02:04:34.181]  They're shutting down.
[02:04:34.241 --> 02:04:35.761]  They supported censorship.
[02:04:36.541 --> 02:04:42.343]  So they got rid of themselves like idiots in the last two years, and now they've made themselves obsolete.
[02:04:42.463 --> 02:04:43.583]  I'm not happy about that.
[02:04:44.023 --> 02:04:48.504]  I don't think of things like, well, if I survive the censorship, I'll be dominant later.
[02:04:48.844 --> 02:04:52.345]  That is just Machiavelli-ing psychotic BS.
[02:04:54.056 --> 02:05:00.558]  Well, it's been other legacy media firms have had the same problem, which is that I think New York Times is downsized.
[02:05:01.119 --> 02:05:02.679]  WAPO, I think, downsized.
[02:05:02.739 --> 02:05:04.120]  Vox and some of these others.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:09.862]  A lot of these groups have already lost a significant amount of their audience in part because they promote censorship.
[02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:10.642]  They're all imploding.
[02:05:11.602 --> 02:05:16.304]  Yeah, because they support censorship and they don't realize eventually it can be aimed at them too.
[02:05:18.948 --> 02:05:23.270]  So what, so gut level then, Sticks, how do you see this ending?
[02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:24.670]  I mean, just in the midterm.
[02:05:27.531 --> 02:05:28.711]  As far as the election?
[02:05:29.212 --> 02:05:36.414]  Just all of it, like what the left's done and what they've turned into and just, it's just like, they're so villainous, I can't even describe it.
[02:05:36.434 --> 02:05:40.495]  I'm like, you guys are so evil, I can't even, like, talk about how bad you are.
[02:05:40.515 --> 02:05:41.836]  It's like, it's ridiculous.
[02:05:43.089 --> 02:05:47.533]  I think that they probably lose 2020 and possibly the House in the process.
[02:05:47.553 --> 02:05:51.396]  And what ends up happening is their party crashes and burns.
[02:05:51.456 --> 02:05:53.558]  The party leadership is largely ousted.
[02:05:53.939 --> 02:05:55.400]  One of two things then happens.
[02:05:55.740 --> 02:06:04.148]  The liberal core, which most of these people are saying, and we can talk about their individual sort of belief systems a little bit more maybe sometime,
[02:06:05.068 --> 02:06:18.932]  I think they either partner with the far left and they become a socialist movement, which of course would mean they'd lose in the future, or I think they eject the socialists like the AOC crowd, the Bernie Sanders nuts, then they end up re-embracing the business Democrats that they've been losing to Trump.
[02:06:19.272 --> 02:06:23.113]  That's why they lost the Rust Belt and it's why they're behind in a lot of these states now.
[02:06:24.493 --> 02:06:25.194]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:06:25.574 --> 02:06:30.115]  And it's just an insane time to be alive and to watch this madness because
[02:06:31.644 --> 02:06:38.329]  If they radicalize even more, though, in closing, if they even get more radical, what happens?
[02:06:40.151 --> 02:06:45.415]  Well, then 99% of people will think they're absolutely nuts instead of just 90% of people.
[02:06:48.117 --> 02:06:49.478]  So they're extincting themselves?
[02:06:50.839 --> 02:06:52.861]  Yeah, I think that the Democrats have a problem.
[02:06:52.921 --> 02:06:55.763]  They could disappear as a party, yeah.
[02:06:55.803 --> 02:06:57.064]  If they don't eject the far left.
[02:06:57.603 --> 02:07:00.104]  Alright, well Stixx, thank you so much for the time.
[02:07:00.965 --> 02:07:05.587]  Stixx, it was a big pleasure to be on.
[02:07:05.627 --> 02:07:06.987]  What's the best place for people to find you?
[02:07:08.288 --> 02:07:10.329]  TarleWarwick.net, my own website.
[02:07:11.229 --> 02:07:11.729]  Say it again?
[02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:14.490]  TarleWarwick.net.
[02:07:14.791 --> 02:07:15.511]  Alright, thank you.
[02:07:15.971 --> 02:07:17.412]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:07:17.492 --> 02:07:19.993]  Daniel, Scott, Ray Austin, get ready, stay with us.
[02:07:21.457 --> 02:07:23.878]  All right, let's just cut right into these callers right now.
[02:07:23.938 --> 02:07:25.639]  Daniel, Scott, Ray, Austin.
[02:07:26.339 --> 02:07:29.861]  You know, I can't answer your question, but I'll try my best.
[02:07:29.881 --> 02:07:35.923]  He's not here, but Ray in Iowa has a question for Norm Pattis when he's back on the next few days.
[02:07:35.963 --> 02:07:36.424]  I'll ask him.
[02:07:36.464 --> 02:07:36.924]  Go ahead, Ray.
[02:07:36.944 --> 02:07:37.424]  You're on the air.
[02:07:38.785 --> 02:07:39.525]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:07:41.246 --> 02:07:41.486]  Alex.
[02:07:41.726 --> 02:07:42.046]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:42.446 --> 02:07:44.107]  Hey, I've been a longtime listener, man.
[02:07:44.167 --> 02:07:50.310]  I've been listening to you since you slaughtered old Piers Morgan, which was, that was sweet, by the way.
[02:07:51.531 --> 02:07:53.352]  At any rate, no, I just wondered.
[02:07:53.412 --> 02:07:54.972]  I listened to David Knight.
[02:07:54.992 --> 02:07:56.713]  David Knight's a hero, man.
[02:07:56.893 --> 02:07:58.013]  His word is golden.
[02:07:58.353 --> 02:08:01.934]  Norm Pattis was on there and he absolutely lied about Roger Stone.
[02:08:01.974 --> 02:08:03.215]  Kind of miffed me a little bit.
[02:08:03.515 --> 02:08:07.796]  He said that it was clear that Roger Stone lied under oath and that's not true.
[02:08:07.816 --> 02:08:10.917]  That was taken out of context, man.
[02:08:12.118 --> 02:08:19.360]  Well, Norm's my lawyer on the whole Sandy Hook, Connecticut thing and he even said on air like five times, sorry I didn't pay attention to the trial, I was believing the
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.200]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:30.502]  I mean, I'm not going to attack Norm, but no, I mean, I was here and Roger was trying to get a job here and I said, you know,
[02:08:42.355 --> 02:08:45.376]  Get Trump again, or get me Julian Assange, and you get the job.
[02:08:45.416 --> 02:08:46.777]  And I ended up getting the job anyways.
[02:08:46.817 --> 02:08:51.819]  But he was here, he was like, well, I'm talking to the intermediaries at WikiLeaks.
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:53.900]  And I'm like, screw Assange.
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:54.720]  He talks to everybody.
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:55.561]  He should talk to us.
[02:08:56.121 --> 02:08:58.202]  I'm on record, you know, attacking Assange for that.
[02:08:58.822 --> 02:09:03.564]  And so I remember, and so he's like, before Congress, well, no, I've talked to intermediaries, but not Assange.
[02:09:04.105 --> 02:09:06.746]  But then he gives speeches going, yes, I'm talking to WikiLeaks.
[02:09:07.486 --> 02:09:08.947]  Again, if you call my office,
[02:09:09.847 --> 02:09:11.389]  And say, I want to talk to Alex Jones.
[02:09:11.429 --> 02:09:12.690]  They go, sorry, he can't talk to you.
[02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:15.933]  You talk to my office like you talk to WikiLeaks.
[02:09:15.993 --> 02:09:16.834]  It's not a lie.
[02:09:17.814 --> 02:09:19.696]  And so that's what happened.
[02:09:19.896 --> 02:09:21.258]  And it doesn't even matter.
[02:09:21.278 --> 02:09:25.361]  Hillary's this Chai Com agent committing all these crimes.
[02:09:25.702 --> 02:09:26.643]  She doesn't get in trouble.
[02:09:27.063 --> 02:09:32.968]  And Rogers facing seven to nine years for saying to Congress, I never talked to Julian Assange.
[02:09:33.309 --> 02:09:33.989]  He didn't.
[02:09:34.129 --> 02:09:35.170]  It's a turn of phrase.
[02:09:35.951 --> 02:09:39.474]  He gave other speeches saying, I'm talking to WikiLeaks!
[02:09:39.534 --> 02:09:40.415]  He was!
[02:09:41.336 --> 02:09:46.220]  I was talking to WikiLeaks, sending a message and saying I want Assange on, talking to Assange's lawyers.
[02:09:46.901 --> 02:09:48.062]  I never talked to Assange!
[02:09:48.142 --> 02:09:49.042]  Big frickin' deal!
[02:09:49.743 --> 02:09:51.865]  That's why I called Assange Hillary Clinton's buttplug.
[02:09:52.786 --> 02:09:57.430]  Because he was hiding all the dirt on her, and I was mad and said release it.
[02:09:57.450 --> 02:09:58.450]  He ended up releasing it.
[02:09:59.992 --> 02:10:03.375]  And now in hindsight I appreciate Julian Assange, but imagine
[02:10:05.370 --> 02:10:10.432]  Facing prison time for trying to interview someone that everybody else had talked to.
[02:10:10.752 --> 02:10:12.332]  That's what we're talking about here, Ray.
[02:10:13.753 --> 02:10:14.933]  No, I get it.
[02:10:14.993 --> 02:10:15.633]  No, I get it.
[02:10:15.653 --> 02:10:19.374]  That's why I say, to me, it seemed like the whole thing was taken out of context.
[02:10:19.815 --> 02:10:22.875]  Yeah, but lawyers parse words.
[02:10:23.816 --> 02:10:27.757]  So they're like, well, wait, you say you were talking to Assange and WikiLeaks.
[02:10:29.037 --> 02:10:30.738]  And again, you come to InfoWars, you knock on the door.
[02:10:32.386 --> 02:10:33.447]  I want to talk to Alex Jones.
[02:10:33.507 --> 02:10:34.208]  Well, he's not here.
[02:10:34.588 --> 02:10:35.729]  You talked to InfoWars.
[02:10:36.129 --> 02:10:36.850]  Did you talk to me?
[02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:37.170]  No.
[02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:41.354]  It's all, how many angels can dance on the head of a pen, brother?
[02:10:42.395 --> 02:10:45.938]  So then, so then, what does Roger Stone do at this point?
[02:10:46.218 --> 02:10:47.239]  So how does the thing go?
[02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:56.127]  Because it almost sounds to me like that, I mean, it's seemingly to me that even you are saying that Roger Stone lied under oath.
[02:10:56.247 --> 02:10:56.988]  No, I'm not saying that.
[02:10:58.251 --> 02:11:02.473]  Well, that's what I'm trying to say is that Norm Pattis was on David Nightshow.
[02:11:02.973 --> 02:11:03.973]  We're not a cult, brother.
[02:11:04.073 --> 02:11:05.334]  I don't control what my guests say.
[02:11:06.214 --> 02:11:09.115]  Roger never talked to Assange.
[02:11:09.296 --> 02:11:09.936]  I was here.
[02:11:10.676 --> 02:11:12.217]  He was talking to WikiLeaks.
[02:11:13.157 --> 02:11:15.078]  So he said, I'm talking to WikiLeaks.
[02:11:15.598 --> 02:11:17.199]  We hear it's going to be really big.
[02:11:18.319 --> 02:11:20.580]  Assange's people said, it's Hillary, it's big.
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:23.942]  He said that on Fox and CNN, the New York Times.
[02:11:24.682 --> 02:11:26.743]  Roger was stating at the time,
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:29.329]  What was already public knowledge.
[02:11:32.082 --> 02:11:34.544]  So I appreciate your call, but I'm totally confused.
[02:11:34.784 --> 02:11:40.388]  Ray, I love you to death, but I just, you know, I'm not saying Roger lied under oath.
[02:11:41.649 --> 02:11:42.550]  I didn't say that.
[02:11:43.150 --> 02:11:49.255]  So you keep wanting me to say that, and I'll snap your neck like a breadstick in a loving way.
[02:11:49.695 --> 02:11:53.138]  I mean, it's at a certain point.
[02:11:53.618 --> 02:11:58.181]  I'm not saying the things you're saying I'm saying, and it pisses me off, okay?
[02:11:59.102 --> 02:12:02.583]  And Roger didn't do anything, okay?
[02:12:02.763 --> 02:12:03.244]  I was there.
[02:12:04.064 --> 02:12:06.685]  In fact, if anybody had a cattle prod in his ass, it was me.
[02:12:06.725 --> 02:12:10.626]  I was like, you get me Julian Assange and Trump again, you want that money?
[02:12:10.646 --> 02:12:13.147]  I know he wasn't talking to him.
[02:12:13.327 --> 02:12:13.947]  I was there.
[02:12:15.448 --> 02:12:18.309]  You know, we can get caught up all day in minutia.
[02:12:19.528 --> 02:12:21.430]  And God knows I do it worse than anybody.
[02:12:22.130 --> 02:12:23.351]  But I'm gonna explain this again.
[02:12:24.312 --> 02:12:29.416]  Roger Stone never talked to Julian Assange and that'd be totally normal to talk to him if he did.
[02:12:31.077 --> 02:12:35.941]  And I have lawyers on the air and guests that say things I don't agree with.
[02:12:36.422 --> 02:12:45.088]  We're not CNN where Jeff Zucker puts out a message and then that is taken like the word of Jesus Christ and everyone else repeats it.
[02:12:45.449 --> 02:12:46.650]  I'm not running a cult here!
[02:12:47.657 --> 02:12:52.838]  They've asked me in lawsuits like, why'd this host say this and you said that and this host said this?
[02:12:53.158 --> 02:12:55.619]  Because I'm not running a cult!
[02:12:57.139 --> 02:12:58.939]  I got people I respect on the air.
[02:12:59.279 --> 02:13:00.600]  We have debates about things.
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:02.040]  That's how the real world works.
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:07.401]  Not some screwed up mental patient thing where everything's a calculated this or that.
[02:13:08.702 --> 02:13:10.382]  We're really trying to figure things out here.
[02:13:11.722 --> 02:13:14.263]  And that's how the real world works.
[02:13:15.143 --> 02:13:15.283]  But
[02:13:16.224 --> 02:13:17.425]  I know Roger Stone.
[02:13:18.926 --> 02:13:28.731]  Only thing he did was advise the President to run for President, and he was on the phone almost every day with him, telling him what he thought he should do.
[02:13:29.652 --> 02:13:34.435]  And they had his phones tapped, and I remember being on the phone with Roger at his steakhouse, he's talking to the President.
[02:13:35.271 --> 02:13:40.795]  After he was elected, and Roger's like, you gotta get rid of these Fiona Hill and McMaster and they're gonna screw you.
[02:13:41.236 --> 02:13:43.477]  I mean, they weren't listening to the president's phone call.
[02:13:43.718 --> 02:13:48.201]  They were pissed that Roger was giving him good counsel as a conciliatory.
[02:13:49.382 --> 02:13:53.525]  That's what they're pissed about, was that Roger wouldn't bow to them.
[02:13:54.146 --> 02:13:59.410]  So they said, we're gonna put your advisor in jail for what he did.
[02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:01.511]  And that's what this really is.
[02:14:02.472 --> 02:14:06.514]  So we can sit here all day and debate this or that or any of this crap.
[02:14:07.215 --> 02:14:09.336]  Roger Stone didn't do anything.
[02:14:09.696 --> 02:14:11.497]  And it's not about kissing Roger's ass.
[02:14:12.017 --> 02:14:13.898]  If he did something wrong, send his ass to prison.
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:27.406]  But if they can send an innocent man to prison in America for free speech and for advising the president successfully, then they can send anybody to prison and we're all in danger.
[02:14:27.546 --> 02:14:28.747]  And that's why I'm pissed off.
[02:14:30.031 --> 02:14:34.292]  So some lawyers on my show and says maybe Roger did perjure himself?
[02:14:34.852 --> 02:14:37.473]  That has nothing to do with me.
[02:14:38.313 --> 02:14:39.733]  What I say is what I say.
[02:14:40.454 --> 02:14:41.674]  That's what matters right here.
[02:14:42.254 --> 02:14:48.435]  Because the minute I try to start controlling what my guests say, I might as well blow my brains out.
[02:14:48.936 --> 02:14:50.396]  Because that's impossible.
[02:14:53.157 --> 02:14:54.237]  The buck stops with me.
[02:14:55.342 --> 02:14:57.063]  What I say is what I believe.
[02:14:57.463 --> 02:15:00.884]  What guests say or what other hosts say is them.
[02:15:01.645 --> 02:15:05.886]  And if I decide somebody works for me is a liar, I'll fire them.
[02:15:06.327 --> 02:15:15.190]  But if one of my crew disagrees with me and brings up legitimate points, then I'm going to listen to that because I'm not a cult leader.
[02:15:17.031 --> 02:15:17.391]  Thank you.
[02:15:18.312 --> 02:15:19.172]  I'm not a cult leader.
[02:15:21.986 --> 02:15:23.346]  I want people to challenge me.
[02:15:23.786 --> 02:15:25.227]  I want people to bring up good points.
[02:15:25.507 --> 02:15:26.747]  I want to be smart.
[02:15:27.767 --> 02:15:31.448]  And you're not smart when you're in a echo chamber.
[02:15:31.568 --> 02:15:32.868]  That's the Democratic Party.
[02:15:33.449 --> 02:15:35.609]  With all their BS, they don't know why they keep losing.
[02:15:35.829 --> 02:15:38.010]  Because they only believe their own BS.
[02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:39.850]  They've got a bunch of yes-men around them.
[02:15:40.190 --> 02:15:43.251]  I tell people that work for me, I said, you get bad news, you tell me right now.
[02:15:43.611 --> 02:15:45.751]  And you disagree with me, you tell me right now if it's legitimate.
[02:15:47.392 --> 02:15:48.912]  That's what the world is really about.
[02:15:52.861 --> 02:15:58.384]  Underwrote the jury foreman in a Roger Stone case, testified that she had no recollection of who Roger Stone was.
[02:15:58.404 --> 02:15:59.725]  Yeah, that's a Mike Cernovich tweet.
[02:16:00.125 --> 02:16:05.328]  And they caught her on Twitter before she was ever a juror talking crap about him.
[02:16:06.809 --> 02:16:07.970]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:11.592]  So yeah, we probably should have a stay on that conviction, right?
[02:16:11.612 --> 02:16:18.616]  Because that Judge Bergman Jackson, whatever her name is, is lucky she's not going to be in prison herself.
[02:16:20.026 --> 02:16:21.108]  God, these people make me sick.
[02:16:21.569 --> 02:16:23.432]  Daniel in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:16:23.472 --> 02:16:23.752]  Go ahead.
[02:16:25.723 --> 02:16:26.283]  Uh, yes sir.
[02:16:26.443 --> 02:16:32.506]  I was calling about, um, well first the LGBTQ whatever stuff, all that.
[02:16:32.566 --> 02:16:42.869]  And you know, I think that we're all pretty much going to lose if Trump could just at least sign saying, hey, this is a, you know, this is blatant child abuse.
[02:16:42.969 --> 02:16:47.351]  Sign a presidential order and have them, you know, just stop Drag Queen Storytime.
[02:16:47.391 --> 02:16:47.851]  I mean, is that?
[02:16:47.891 --> 02:16:48.691]  Well, there's no doubt.
[02:16:48.771 --> 02:16:51.012]  I don't care if you're homosexual or heterosexual.
[02:16:51.432 --> 02:16:52.313]  Kids are off limits.
[02:16:52.353 --> 02:16:52.813]  Leave them alone.
[02:16:53.814 --> 02:16:58.345]  And the Democrats definitely have a hunger for children.
[02:16:59.147 --> 02:17:00.109]  And it's disgusting.
[02:17:01.519 --> 02:17:05.261]  Exactly, and see that's the spiritual battle about that.
[02:17:05.361 --> 02:17:20.310]  I think that's where another fear of mine is that when if they implement 6G, like whatever everything has in common with the cell towers and the 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, they're implementing now at the same time while suppressing free speech.
[02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:26.353]  The chakra system, the human body chakra system, it's the throat chakra is the fifth chakra.
[02:17:28.355 --> 02:17:32.739]  Well, there's no doubt there's an attack on the biological system of humans.
[02:17:33.719 --> 02:17:34.220]  Exactly.
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:39.625]  And then if they get 6G, that's the pineal gland area.
[02:17:40.586 --> 02:17:43.128]  I mean, wouldn't that cut off all of our connection to God?
[02:17:44.609 --> 02:17:49.073]  Well, there's no doubt they can use electromagnetic systems to manipulate human psychological activities.
[02:17:49.674 --> 02:17:50.935]  I appreciate you, Daniel.
[02:17:50.975 --> 02:17:51.575]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:51.996 --> 02:17:53.637]  Scott in Indiana, then Austin in Florida.
[02:17:53.657 --> 02:17:54.158]  You're on the air.
[02:17:54.178 --> 02:17:54.478]  Go ahead.
[02:17:56.789 --> 02:18:02.574]  Man, I'm just up here just watching all... I'm watching the whole New World Order blow up in front of me.
[02:18:03.335 --> 02:18:04.656]  Yeah, it's crazy, man.
[02:18:04.696 --> 02:18:05.937]  I've been a fan for a long time.
[02:18:06.017 --> 02:18:08.459]  I've been listening to you since, uh, 95.
[02:18:08.999 --> 02:18:11.141]  Back when you were, you know, covering the Waco.
[02:18:11.602 --> 02:18:12.022]  Wow.
[02:18:12.302 --> 02:18:16.346]  So you've been listening 20... Wow, 25, 26 years, brother.
[02:18:16.846 --> 02:18:17.287]  Yes, I have.
[02:18:17.307 --> 02:18:18.888]  Been following you every step of the way.
[02:18:18.908 --> 02:18:20.890]  Hard to believe we've been on the air that long.
[02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:23.412]  It's like, we didn't just start this up yesterday.
[02:18:24.093 --> 02:18:28.575]  Yeah, there's been some things you've said that I don't agree with, but I've always respected your opinion.
[02:18:28.615 --> 02:18:32.738]  The reason I wanted to call in today, you know, was about this coronavirus stuff.
[02:18:33.718 --> 02:18:36.760]  You know, it's pretty obvious that they're not telling us the whole story.
[02:18:38.041 --> 02:18:42.543]  They're saying that it's only, you know, 10, 12 cases here in the United States.
[02:18:42.643 --> 02:18:47.926]  Alex, every single person that I know is either sick,
[02:18:48.547 --> 02:18:49.128]  With the flu?
[02:18:49.568 --> 02:18:52.731]  Or has someone in their family with respiratory syndrome?
[02:18:52.771 --> 02:18:53.411]  Oh yeah, listen.
[02:18:53.772 --> 02:18:55.613]  It's been over four years since I had a fever.
[02:18:56.154 --> 02:18:57.255]  I got one a week ago.
[02:18:57.515 --> 02:18:59.237]  Everybody I know is coughing their guts out.
[02:19:00.458 --> 02:19:02.600]  There's like 500 kids from their school.
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:08.665]  You know, this is, I think, potentially a lot bigger, you know, than what they're saying.
[02:19:08.745 --> 02:19:13.810]  And the one thing I wanted to ask you, and I'll get on here because I know we've got some other people calling on, is
[02:19:14.858 --> 02:19:18.461]  You know, suppose this does come out that this is a Chinese biological weapon.
[02:19:18.961 --> 02:19:19.662]  You know, then what?
[02:19:20.403 --> 02:19:22.604]  You know, somebody has to be held responsible.
[02:19:23.765 --> 02:19:25.987]  Does that mean this is going to be World War III?
[02:19:27.588 --> 02:19:29.250]  Brother, I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:19:29.290 --> 02:19:31.131]  There's no doubt this has been engineered.
[02:19:31.191 --> 02:19:33.413]  The question is then, what was it engineered for?
[02:19:33.473 --> 02:19:34.214]  I appreciate your call.
[02:19:34.554 --> 02:19:35.795]  We don't have those answers yet.
[02:19:35.975 --> 02:19:36.796]  I don't have those answers.
[02:19:37.116 --> 02:19:38.357]  If I told you, I'd be lying to you.
[02:19:38.377 --> 02:19:38.938]  I'm not going to do that.
[02:19:39.778 --> 02:19:41.700]  It's easy to sit up here and say we have all the answers.
[02:19:42.813 --> 02:19:55.461]  But I've got four children, and I hope it's not as bad as they're saying, but the evidence leans towards it not being good and being engineered, so... Prepare for the worst, hope for the best, as they say.
[02:19:55.921 --> 02:19:57.882]  Austin in Florida, thank you for calling.
[02:19:58.383 --> 02:20:00.304]  Last caller before Matt Bracken takes over.
[02:20:01.565 --> 02:20:02.965]  Hey Alex, can you hear me okay?
[02:20:03.186 --> 02:20:04.026]  I can, thank you.
[02:20:04.947 --> 02:20:06.888]  Hey, I just want to say I'm a huge fan.
[02:20:07.549 --> 02:20:09.090]  And I appreciate all that you do.
[02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:11.212]  I know you get that all the time, but I really mean it.
[02:20:11.232 --> 02:20:12.093]  No, I appreciate you, brother.
[02:20:12.113 --> 02:20:14.674]  No, every time you thank me, I just want to fight harder.
[02:20:14.835 --> 02:20:15.735]  We're in this together, man.
[02:20:16.616 --> 02:20:17.356]  Keep at it, brother.
[02:20:17.657 --> 02:20:21.239]  I heard about you on the Joe Rogan podcast for the first time.
[02:20:21.580 --> 02:20:25.162]  You dropped a lot of bombs, a lot of knowledge bombs on that podcast.
[02:20:25.502 --> 02:20:26.783]  Changed my life, man.
[02:20:26.823 --> 02:20:31.527]  For a long time, I was battling demons just with, you know, being an atheist.
[02:20:31.986 --> 02:20:34.388]  And then you made me realize the evil in this world.
[02:20:34.448 --> 02:20:36.910]  And I know that if there's evil, there's got to be good.
[02:20:37.370 --> 02:20:40.112]  And you know, by the grace of God, I was able to be saved.
[02:20:40.152 --> 02:20:41.633]  So thank you so much for opening up.
[02:20:41.653 --> 02:20:42.834]  That's beautiful news, brother.
[02:20:42.854 --> 02:20:44.215]  Yeah, no, it's all real.
[02:20:45.155 --> 02:20:46.576]  The devil's real, but so is God.
[02:20:47.677 --> 02:20:48.217]  Absolutely.
[02:20:48.538 --> 02:20:51.400]  So also, I just ordered my two week supply of food.
[02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:56.103]  I'm going to keep stocking up and gradually keep it going so I can keep my family safe.
[02:20:56.531 --> 02:20:59.795]  Also got your Info Wars patch hat, the snake patch.
[02:21:00.216 --> 02:21:01.717]  I think that's a cool logo, man.
[02:21:01.757 --> 02:21:02.318]  I love that.
[02:21:02.839 --> 02:21:05.261]  And your crew is awesome with the memes.
[02:21:05.702 --> 02:21:10.087]  You know, when I'm watching you live on the stream, you say something, they pop it right up immediately.
[02:21:10.107 --> 02:21:12.210]  They're amazing, aren't they?
[02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.971]  They really are, man.
[02:21:13.011 --> 02:21:13.611]  They really are.
[02:21:13.932 --> 02:21:15.614]  And I just appreciate all you do.
[02:21:15.694 --> 02:21:16.595]  Keep fighting.
[02:21:17.037 --> 02:21:17.517]  I believe.
[02:21:17.557 --> 02:21:19.218]  I'm trying to get more people to watch you.
[02:21:41.594 --> 02:21:42.135]  We're going to do it.
[02:21:42.515 --> 02:21:43.596]  So I'm very blessed to be here.
[02:21:43.736 --> 02:21:44.838]  So I'm going to stay on air.
[02:21:44.858 --> 02:21:50.023]  I want you to support us and pray for us and word of mouth because that keeps us right in the front of the fight.
[02:21:50.463 --> 02:21:51.625]  Matt Bracken takes over.
[02:21:51.945 --> 02:21:53.006]  Thank you so much, Austin.
[02:21:53.346 --> 02:21:56.750]  Matt Bracken takes over the other side and the war room is coming up in 45 minutes.
[02:21:57.150 --> 02:21:58.392]  Infowars.com.
[02:22:00.498 --> 02:22:02.059]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:02.079 --> 02:22:03.300]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:07.362]  Matt Bracken is on the road right now having technical difficulties.
[02:22:07.382 --> 02:22:08.843]  He'll take over very, very soon.
[02:22:08.863 --> 02:22:16.628]  And you know, that's not a good thing, but it's also a good thing because I have a lot of clips I want to get to and a lot of news I want to cover.
[02:22:17.148 --> 02:22:23.072]  Tyler Nixon is a really interesting, smart guy and who is Roger Stone's private lawyer.
[02:22:24.127 --> 02:22:32.490]  I'll tell you what, yesterday after over a year of this ordeal, which really was more than a year because they began essentially dismantling or dissecting Roger's life, you know, calling in everybody he works with,
[02:22:51.346 --> 02:22:53.728]  Rummaging through his garbage, you name it.
[02:22:53.908 --> 02:23:07.819]  It's been a year of just constant piling on with this government juggernaut run by abusive, malicious, power-mad, crypto-partisan, corrupt prosecutors.
[02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:09.200]  Persecutors, really, is what they are.
[02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:10.841]  They're not prosecutors, they're persecutors.
[02:23:11.662 --> 02:23:19.268]  Running Roger through this completely contrived, overblown, bogus hair-splitting, but yet
[02:23:19.728 --> 02:23:45.009]  Highly consequential on paper if you know because of the penalties involved Case against him and this is the first yesterday was the first year and Roger agreed with me I texted him late last night and said I think this is the first day that we you know You've actually had a break that we've actually been able to see some level of ray of hope for justice in this matter and and the people who have abused and
[02:23:45.889 --> 02:23:46.430]  We're good to go.
[02:23:58.506 --> 02:24:17.537]  Now that President Trump and Attorney General Barr have focused on this case and the outrage, the outrageous sentencing memorandum they submitted, which was frankly chock full of outright falsehoods, misstatements, manipulations, very just, you know, consistent with how they ran the entire case.
[02:24:17.797 --> 02:24:22.121]  You know, it was literally like I felt like I just read a DNC talking points memo.
[02:24:22.421 --> 02:24:23.703]  That's who it could have been drafted by.
[02:24:23.763 --> 02:24:29.188]  And that's frankly who these crooked, despicable prosecutors were serving in the end.
[02:24:29.288 --> 02:24:37.075]  I mean, this was these were Hillary Obama loyalists embedded in the Department of Justice who were tasked and assigned
[02:24:37.455 --> 02:24:40.677]  to essentially string up Roger Stone to lynch him.
[02:24:41.137 --> 02:24:43.959]  You know, I call it the witch hunt lynch mob is what these guys were.
[02:24:44.239 --> 02:24:45.120]  There were four of them.
[02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:47.321]  They were, you know, they were gleeful.
[02:24:47.661 --> 02:24:58.408]  They were out over the top, manipulative, disingenuous, deceitful in bringing this malicious prosecution against Roger and destroying his life.
[02:24:59.288 --> 02:25:11.195]  And now he faces prison and they have the gall to present a bogus, fantasy-derived sentencing memorandum asking for seven to nine years of a 67-year-old man's life.
[02:25:11.356 --> 02:25:18.180]  The violations of his civil rights are unprecedented in any case I've ever seen in American history and certainly in my own legal career.
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:21.802]  I've never heard of such draconian, tyrannical,
[02:25:22.142 --> 02:25:22.482]  I think?
[02:25:46.676 --> 02:25:52.259]  What the Democrats have done in practice is they have weaponized the judicial system.
[02:25:52.299 --> 02:25:53.420]  They have weaponized it.
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:55.220]  They've turned it into a political weapon.
[02:25:55.561 --> 02:26:01.864]  They've put their activist legal snipers on benches and in black robes to do their bidding.
[02:26:02.304 --> 02:26:08.867]  And you know, you just get the feeling that they're kind of sitting back behind closed doors, just laughing their asses off.
[02:26:09.247 --> 02:26:19.429]  At conservatives and Trump supporters because they're sitting here like, haha, we got this big gun, we got this big bazooka, the judicial system, and we're just firing at will and they're not doing anything!
[02:26:20.287 --> 02:26:22.108]  Well, it's like the devil can do anything he wants.
[02:26:22.548 --> 02:26:31.911]  He can be the most grotesque, abusive, disgusting, vile piece of crap and attack people and just slaughter and maim and mutilate.
[02:26:32.531 --> 02:26:36.052]  But if you're on the side of good and you're fighting that, you can't do that.
[02:26:36.132 --> 02:26:38.033]  You can't murder in the name of justice.
[02:26:38.073 --> 02:26:43.734]  You can't string people up in the name of a good civil society.
[02:26:43.894 --> 02:26:47.516]  You cannot tell me that President Trump did not understand what was going on.
[02:26:47.556 --> 02:26:48.576]  I think he's a keen guy.
[02:26:49.316 --> 02:26:54.120]  And I think he's someone who does care about his friends, and especially someone who he's seen.
[02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:59.444]  I don't think Trump's like a touchy-feely guy who's like, oh, he loves everybody around him.
[02:26:59.664 --> 02:27:09.391]  But I think he is someone who abhors injustice and does not want to see people get screwed or railroaded, especially under his watch, so to speak.
[02:27:09.431 --> 02:27:10.312]  I think he's the type of guy.
[02:27:10.752 --> 02:27:25.703]  He may not be slapping you on the back and telling jokes and making you feel good, but if someone tries to harm you and you're under his sort of umbrella, he will come in like gangbusters and make sure that the bad guys are taken care of and that you're protected.
[02:27:26.924 --> 02:27:34.650]  Well, in the last couple months there's been two New York Times articles and one said Roger Stone's conviction is a consolation prize.
[02:27:35.543 --> 02:27:42.049]  And to show how they put out talking points, another writer said, Alex Jones getting sued and Alex Jones, that's a consolation prize.
[02:27:42.970 --> 02:27:47.914]  So they just want a weird mentally ill victory, like, we're messing with somebody that supports Trump.
[02:27:48.234 --> 02:27:49.215]  We're going to ruin their life.
[02:27:49.255 --> 02:27:50.376]  That makes us feel powerful.
[02:27:51.157 --> 02:27:58.483]  But I got to tell you, as big as Epstein was, and it was huge, people waking up when they killed him in the jail cell, this
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:00.820]  Roger Stone thing.
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:06.061]  There's no Russiagate, there's no Russian agents, there's no spying, there's no money, there's nothing.
[02:28:07.182 --> 02:28:08.722]  Lying to Congress when he didn't.
[02:28:08.762 --> 02:28:10.763]  He said, I've never talked to Assange.
[02:28:10.803 --> 02:28:12.623]  He used to say, I've talked to WikiLeaks.
[02:28:13.343 --> 02:28:14.323]  Totally two different things.
[02:28:14.363 --> 02:28:21.485]  So they keep playing that semantical game of, well, did you, you say you talked to Assange, but you didn't.
[02:28:22.705 --> 02:28:25.626]  You go to jail for that longer than an armed robber does?
[02:28:27.076 --> 02:28:28.377]  They've really jumped the shark here.
[02:28:29.398 --> 02:28:42.289]  Now some of these clips I want to get to is Trump saying the Democrats are crooked and the media saying, oh saying that's obstruction of justice or saying you'll pardon Stone's obstruction of justice or saying that the
[02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:46.694]  Recommended time by these prosecutors is too long.
[02:28:46.795 --> 02:28:51.521]  They lied to the Justice Department, it turns out, a month ago and said he was only going to get recommended a year.
[02:28:51.962 --> 02:28:54.766]  But then to the judge, they said seven to nine years.
[02:28:54.826 --> 02:28:57.269]  So there's just so much fraud.
[02:28:57.609 --> 02:28:58.851]  These guys are going for broke.
[02:28:58.871 --> 02:29:00.073]  Here's the president talking about it.
[02:29:01.247 --> 02:29:04.671]  Lisa Murkowski earlier said that you shouldn't have gotten involved with the Roger Stone case.
[02:29:04.711 --> 02:29:05.652]  She said it's just bad.
[02:29:05.672 --> 02:29:08.995]  Some Republicans have said they hoped you would learn a lesson from impeachment.
[02:29:09.055 --> 02:29:11.418]  What lesson did you learn from impeachment?
[02:29:11.458 --> 02:29:13.860]  That the Democrats are crooked.
[02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:15.502]  They've got a lot of crooked things going.
[02:29:15.982 --> 02:29:17.063]  That they're vicious.
[02:29:17.984 --> 02:29:19.846]  That they shouldn't have brought impeachment.
[02:29:20.066 --> 02:29:24.171]  And that my poll numbers are 10 points higher because of fake news like NBC.
[02:29:24.851 --> 02:29:31.593]  He's supposed to cower once they say that and go, oh I'm so sorry you ran a whole fake operation against me.
[02:29:31.633 --> 02:29:34.874]  Let's go out to break with Don Jr.
[02:29:34.914 --> 02:29:35.134]  Here it is.
[02:29:53.729 --> 02:29:57.373]  The silence was deafening, you know, when I see that happen.
[02:29:57.393 --> 02:30:06.722]  And by the way, the violence against conservatives and Republicans and Trump supporters is so prevalent and so underreported, I mean, if at all.
[02:30:06.902 --> 02:30:11.066]  I mean, if the shoe was on the other foot and that was some sort of pretend
[02:30:11.246 --> 02:30:16.373]  You know, crazy right wing, alt-right, whatever person doing it to a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren.
[02:30:16.694 --> 02:30:19.758]  It would be the number one news story all over America.
[02:30:19.998 --> 02:30:23.883]  There's not a journalist that wouldn't be covering it ad nauseum for weeks.
[02:30:24.384 --> 02:30:26.427]  But when it happens to a Trump supporter, I'm gonna...
[02:30:27.468 --> 02:30:33.993]  Honestly, it's getting to the point of tacit complacency from the left and from the media, which are basically the same thing at this point.
[02:30:34.534 --> 02:30:35.655]  It's truly disgusting.
[02:30:35.695 --> 02:30:42.841]  It would be one of the largest, if not the largest story, superseding all of the primary stuff, all of the craziness in Iowa.
[02:30:43.401 --> 02:30:52.990]  You know, I don't want to be overly positive about Trump finally fighting back and what's happening because we have to think about what we're opposing.
[02:30:53.885 --> 02:31:00.330]  I mean, we're opposing Bernie Sanders and communism that we know flies like a lead balloon.
[02:31:01.751 --> 02:31:02.452]  A lead zeppelin.
[02:31:03.553 --> 02:31:09.177]  And so it's like, wait, we're barely winning against the most evil, ridiculous crap the world's ever seen?
[02:31:10.458 --> 02:31:11.920]  America is in a coma.
[02:31:13.140 --> 02:31:14.882]  And let's not lie to ourselves about that.
[02:31:14.902 --> 02:31:15.783]  We've all got problems.
[02:31:17.704 --> 02:31:18.325]  I got problems.
[02:31:19.105 --> 02:31:20.687]  I'm a decadent slob in many ways.
[02:31:21.567 --> 02:31:23.489]  But at least I recognize good from evil.
[02:31:25.162 --> 02:31:34.410]  So this is a really important boil down some of the crew put together of some of the outrageous things that Bernie Sanders is putting out.
[02:31:34.430 --> 02:31:39.214]  And the fact that a third of Americans, roughly, think this is a good idea.
[02:31:39.694 --> 02:31:40.535]  Here's what he had to say.
[02:31:41.476 --> 02:31:42.197]  You know, it's funny.
[02:31:42.237 --> 02:31:46.300]  Sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is because people are lining up for food.
[02:31:47.281 --> 02:31:48.022]  That's a good thing.
[02:31:48.882 --> 02:31:50.784]  In other countries, people don't line up for food.
[02:31:50.824 --> 02:31:52.946]  The rich get the food and the poor starve to death.
[02:31:54.344 --> 02:31:57.545]  You know, as a socialist, the word socialism does not frighten me.
[02:31:57.645 --> 02:32:05.446]  When we were in Moscow, for example, I think most of the people here also were extremely impressed by their public transportation system.
[02:32:06.146 --> 02:32:12.808]  The stations themselves were absolutely beautiful, including many works of art, chandeliers that were beautiful.
[02:32:13.108 --> 02:32:14.828]  It was a very, very effective system.
[02:32:15.408 --> 02:32:18.509]  Also, I was impressed by the youth programs that they have.
[02:32:19.367 --> 02:32:30.951]  Uh, their palaces of culture for the young people, a whole variety of programs for young people, and cultural programs which go far beyond what we do in this country.
[02:32:31.391 --> 02:32:32.831]  To China and its leadership.
[02:32:33.571 --> 02:32:38.113]  Because if I'm not mistaken they have made more progress in addressing extreme poverty.
[02:32:39.221 --> 02:32:41.882]  Than any country in the history of civilization.
[02:32:42.402 --> 02:32:42.662]  Okay?
[02:32:42.682 --> 02:32:44.023]  So they've done a lot of things for their people.
[02:32:44.483 --> 02:32:49.665]  But I remember, for some reason or other, being very excited when Fidel Castro made the revolution in Cuba.
[02:32:49.725 --> 02:32:51.205]  I was a kid and I remember reading that.
[02:32:51.625 --> 02:32:56.547]  And it just seemed right and appropriate that poor people were rising up against rather ugly rich people.
[02:32:56.687 --> 02:33:00.010]  You may recall way back in, what was it, 1961, they invaded Cuba.
[02:33:00.290 --> 02:33:07.275]  And everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world, that all the Cuban people were gonna rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro.
[02:33:07.575 --> 02:33:11.879]  They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them healthcare, totally transformed the society.
[02:33:13.027 --> 02:33:19.109]  But just because Ronald Reagan dislikes these people does not mean to say that the people in their own nations feel the same way.
[02:33:19.469 --> 02:33:21.630]  But have some good things been done in Cuba?
[02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.250]  Yes.
[02:33:22.690 --> 02:33:25.331]  How do you find the sincerity of Sandinista leaders?
[02:33:25.871 --> 02:33:26.491]  I was impressed.
[02:33:27.072 --> 02:33:31.553]  I was impressed by Father Descoto, because he is a very gentle, very loving man.
[02:33:32.313 --> 02:33:33.794]  Ortega is an impressive guy.
[02:33:35.614 --> 02:33:37.715]  Ernesto Cardinal is a funny looking guy.
[02:33:37.735 --> 02:33:38.475]  He's grey hair.
[02:33:38.995 --> 02:33:40.336]  And he really does remind you of a hippie.
[02:33:41.136 --> 02:33:45.038]  Why have you stopped short of calling Maduro of Venezuela a dictator?
[02:33:46.879 --> 02:33:54.803]  Well... He... I think it's fair to say that the last election was undemocratic.
[02:33:56.664 --> 02:34:00.646]  But there are still democratic operations taking place in that country.
[02:34:04.988 --> 02:34:05.488]  This man...
[02:34:13.919 --> 02:34:16.099]  And if you look at the big corporations, who are they funding?
[02:34:17.940 --> 02:34:19.340]  They're funding a bunch of Democrats.
[02:34:22.741 --> 02:34:23.601]  Because they're billionaires.
[02:34:23.621 --> 02:34:26.501]  They've already written the laws where they don't pay the tax.
[02:34:27.001 --> 02:34:40.444]  And they want you believing some communist is going to give you a free lunch so you don't organize and promote better trade deals and lower taxes.
[02:34:41.570 --> 02:34:44.613]  And things that we know will turn this economy loose.
[02:34:45.434 --> 02:34:52.262]  It's really nauseating to think we're up here celebrating that Trump's winning just barely against that?
[02:34:55.605 --> 02:35:00.511]  I mean, they don't have toilet paper to wipe their asses in Venezuela or North Korea, folks.
[02:35:03.868 --> 02:35:10.690]  We sit here with all this wealth and all this power and bitch and complain about it because we've got so many choices compared to other people.
[02:35:11.390 --> 02:35:13.131]  It's just there's no even comparison.
[02:35:13.171 --> 02:35:18.453]  It's like, it's like arguing that you shouldn't shoot yourself in the head with a gun.
[02:35:19.793 --> 02:35:25.075]  There's Bernie Sanders with his bozo hair and all his dumb ass academics.
[02:35:26.513 --> 02:35:27.873]  Who want to run things.
[02:35:27.913 --> 02:35:33.655]  Those academics know they're not going to get free stuff in a communist system, except they're going to run things.
[02:35:35.855 --> 02:35:38.876]  They're not going to run a company that employs people and has to compete in the market.
[02:35:39.176 --> 02:35:41.516]  They're not going to have a farm.
[02:35:41.916 --> 02:35:46.598]  They're going to sit there with a gun to your head and tell you how to live your life.
[02:35:46.818 --> 02:35:48.218]  That's what communism is.
[02:35:51.448 --> 02:35:57.110]  Capitalism's problem is it produces so much damn wealth that it creates a bunch of decadent jackasses.
[02:35:57.630 --> 02:35:58.670]  Let's just be honest about it.
[02:35:59.690 --> 02:36:01.991]  Prosperity creates monsters.
[02:36:02.191 --> 02:36:05.452]  Adversity creates men, as Victor Hugo, the French philosopher, said.
[02:36:05.472 --> 02:36:06.032]  And it's true!
[02:36:08.373 --> 02:36:11.013]  I'm a spoiled brat compared to my dad and his dad.
[02:36:11.433 --> 02:36:13.174]  And my children are spoiled brats compared to me.
[02:36:13.834 --> 02:36:14.794]  I'm not putting my kids down.
[02:36:14.854 --> 02:36:15.214]  It's true.
[02:36:15.435 --> 02:36:15.835]  I did it.
[02:36:16.075 --> 02:36:16.635]  I messed up.
[02:36:18.295 --> 02:36:20.796]  Maybe they're gonna wake up, but they just don't get it.
[02:36:24.878 --> 02:36:26.780]  Hey dad, I want a new jacket.
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:27.601]  I want some new shoes.
[02:36:27.621 --> 02:36:28.261]  Go get a job.
[02:36:28.281 --> 02:36:29.142]  I was 12.
[02:36:29.322 --> 02:36:32.566]  I'm like, my dad thought I was so smart.
[02:36:32.586 --> 02:36:34.688]  I go, dad, there's labor laws against that.
[02:36:34.708 --> 02:36:36.189]  He goes, people ignore those.
[02:36:37.130 --> 02:36:37.671]  Go get one.
[02:36:38.652 --> 02:36:42.636]  He goes, I bet you can go down to that marina right now and get a job over there.
[02:36:42.656 --> 02:36:43.657]  I actually did.
[02:36:43.677 --> 02:36:45.919]  I was like, wow, I got all this money.
[02:36:45.939 --> 02:36:47.541]  He goes, yeah.
[02:36:49.056 --> 02:36:50.957]  Now you can give me part of it, pay for the light bill.
[02:36:51.578 --> 02:36:54.560]  But the point was, is that he wasn't being a dick.
[02:36:55.541 --> 02:36:57.342]  He was like, not trying to create a jellyfish.
[02:36:57.882 --> 02:37:02.186]  Well, my kids are great, but they're jellyfish compared to me, compared to my dad.
[02:37:02.706 --> 02:37:04.667]  And it's like, what have we done?
[02:37:05.168 --> 02:37:07.630]  That now my kids know Bernie Sanders is full of crap.
[02:37:07.850 --> 02:37:10.612]  They're smart enough to know capitalism is the reason they're doing so well.
[02:37:10.652 --> 02:37:13.434]  But imagine the next step down.
[02:37:15.626 --> 02:37:27.294]  Where you actually believe some bozo, the clown commie, some shyster swindler like Bernie Sanders is going to give you all this free stuff?
[02:37:28.014 --> 02:37:30.556]  Only thing he's gonna give you is a firing squad, man.
[02:37:38.482 --> 02:37:40.983]  But his whole life, he's never had a real job.
[02:37:41.564 --> 02:37:44.786]  And he's just there to rule over everybody and
[02:37:46.001 --> 02:37:52.307]  Tell us how we're supposed to live because he has that intellectual clown haircut.
[02:37:53.488 --> 02:37:54.228]  Enough about him.
[02:38:00.334 --> 02:38:02.516]  I've got so much news here it'll make your head spin.
[02:38:04.618 --> 02:38:06.079]  But I don't even know where to start.
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:09.322]  Here's an InfoWars.com article.
[02:38:10.956 --> 02:38:16.078]  YouTube deletes video of Rand Paul saying name of CIA whistleblower on Senate floor.
[02:38:18.158 --> 02:38:27.741]  We live in a country where a senator saying the name of a fake whistleblower is censored and Trump says, well, that's what private companies can do.
[02:38:27.801 --> 02:38:28.722]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:38:30.282 --> 02:38:30.542]  Really?
[02:38:32.823 --> 02:38:36.364]  I didn't know that free market capitalism was a suicide pact.
[02:38:39.568 --> 02:38:40.248]  Because it's not.
[02:38:40.609 --> 02:38:58.260]  We believe you own your house and you own your bank account, but you don't own the utilities of communications to get into a phone call or a text message or a video and then to come in and say, I'm going to block that and I'm going to control what somebody hears or sees.
[02:38:58.621 --> 02:39:00.102]  That's called authoritarianism.
[02:39:00.422 --> 02:39:02.923]  We fought wars to stop that.
[02:39:03.964 --> 02:39:07.967]  And as happy as I am that Trump's finally rolling out against the enemy,
[02:39:10.620 --> 02:39:13.582]  On his trajectory, that's very nice right now.
[02:39:13.602 --> 02:39:17.264]  I mean, it's a nice, roaring start of going after Deep State.
[02:39:18.624 --> 02:39:27.609]  Two weeks, a month maximum, if I don't see action by the President against these racketeers and these censors, I just can't help it.
[02:39:28.049 --> 02:39:30.951]  I'm not going to sell out to anything, except the truth.
[02:39:31.791 --> 02:39:33.072]  I'm going to have some big problems.
[02:39:33.932 --> 02:39:35.913]  And then I'm going to ask myself, what am I going to do?
[02:39:36.293 --> 02:39:39.035]  What am I going to ask the audience to do to make sure
[02:39:42.725 --> 02:39:56.796]  We do something about this, because if you look at who runs CPAC in the Republican Party, these are a bunch of just cowardly, chicken-neck leftists that decided to be Republicans because they make more money.
[02:39:56.836 --> 02:40:04.583]  I mean, that's our big problem, is that Trump's good, but man, the Republican Party are just the scum of the earth.
[02:40:06.872 --> 02:40:14.379]  So in a few minutes, I'm going to air the censored video taken down by YouTube of Senator Rand Paul.
[02:40:14.399 --> 02:40:15.600]  It was taken down last night.
[02:40:16.361 --> 02:40:17.942]  The full video is up on Infowars.com.
[02:40:17.962 --> 02:40:19.364]  We're going to play part of it right now.
[02:40:20.144 --> 02:40:20.785]  A U.S.
[02:40:20.965 --> 02:40:21.386]  Senator
[02:40:22.557 --> 02:40:25.779]  Giving a speech is now censored by YouTube.
[02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:28.081]  What a bunch of arrogant jerks.
[02:40:28.201 --> 02:40:32.284]  Just last year, Sundar Pichai said, we never censored anything.
[02:40:32.324 --> 02:40:34.005]  We've never heard of that.
[02:40:34.085 --> 02:40:38.528]  YouTube deletes video of Rand Paul saying, name of CIA whistleblower on the Senate floor.
[02:40:39.949 --> 02:40:40.830]  Eric Saramala.
[02:40:41.851 --> 02:40:42.931]  But first, let's get to this.
[02:40:46.454 --> 02:40:51.978]  You'll remember, six months ago, the Democrats, Hollywood, were putting out a movie
[02:40:54.175 --> 02:40:57.498]  That was dealing with the hunting down and killing of Trump supporters.
[02:40:58.879 --> 02:41:04.764]  In fact, Trump supporters are kidnapped and taken to be hunted.
[02:41:05.885 --> 02:41:08.608]  Trump slams Hollywood amid furor over the Hunt movie.
[02:41:08.668 --> 02:41:10.610]  Well, they said they weren't going to release it.
[02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:11.771]  And I said, you watch.
[02:41:13.492 --> 02:41:15.114]  They will before the election.
[02:41:15.994 --> 02:41:18.277]  Well, they just announced a release date.
[02:41:19.229 --> 02:41:20.951]  And they're going to be releasing the movie.
[02:41:20.971 --> 02:41:22.712]  They've got a bunch of other movies just like it.
[02:41:23.073 --> 02:41:29.198]  You just saw that guy run over six Trump supporters in Florida, and the media was totally silent.
[02:41:29.358 --> 02:41:38.747]  This is their only hope, is causing violence, is trying to trigger some type of violent conflagration.
[02:41:41.607 --> 02:41:48.371]  So here is the attempt to cause a civil war in this country by Hollywood, just like the Joker was an attempt at that.
[02:41:48.451 --> 02:41:52.333]  And now we've got cops getting shot in New York and riots on the trains.
[02:41:52.393 --> 02:42:00.058]  It's all the same communist dream, the same wet dream of these rich Hollywood scum that's not going to succeed.
[02:42:14.162 --> 02:42:14.943]  What is happening?
[02:42:14.983 --> 02:42:15.723]  What is all of this?
[02:42:16.123 --> 02:42:17.404]  Did you see that article?
[02:42:17.844 --> 02:42:23.647]  Every year these liberal elites kidnap a bunch of normal folks like us and hunt us for sport.
[02:42:27.108 --> 02:42:29.369]  The last I heard, free speech still exists.
[02:42:29.529 --> 02:42:30.710]  Don't First Amendment me.
[02:42:30.890 --> 02:42:31.791]  It wasn't real.
[02:42:31.811 --> 02:42:35.832]  Everybody get out of here!
[02:42:36.013 --> 02:42:36.833]  We were joking.
[02:42:40.728 --> 02:42:41.548]  There's been a killing spree.
[02:42:41.568 --> 02:42:42.569]  You gotta come here right now.
[02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:48.672]  You actually believed we were hunting human beings for sport.
[02:42:48.892 --> 02:42:50.913]  Look how badly acted you are.
[02:42:50.973 --> 02:42:52.054]  This is not who you are.
[02:42:55.136 --> 02:42:57.837]  We have an opportunity here to teach these people.
[02:42:59.638 --> 02:43:01.259]  These are not real people.
[02:43:01.979 --> 02:43:02.840]  They're actors.
[02:43:05.546 --> 02:43:07.906]  I'm playing an Arab refugee, but I identify as white.
[02:43:08.226 --> 02:43:10.607]  I think that's problematic too, in some way.
[02:43:10.847 --> 02:43:13.707]  You wanted it to be real, so you decided it was.
[02:43:13.727 --> 02:43:21.249]  So, Hollywood is delusional.
[02:43:21.329 --> 02:43:22.749]  And it's diseased.
[02:43:22.769 --> 02:43:25.229]  What kind of sick people would even think of something like that?
[02:43:25.549 --> 02:43:26.090]  White people.
[02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:27.590]  We're the worst.
[02:43:28.530 --> 02:43:31.310]  And so we have a movie about how white people are bad that deserve to be killed.
[02:43:31.470 --> 02:43:34.071]  That's where these people are going.
[02:43:35.083 --> 02:43:43.946]  That's what happens with all the drugs and all the weirdness in Hollywood and Silicon Valley's like this big demonic spider that just poops all this out on us.
[02:43:44.487 --> 02:43:50.309]  And then they want to silence us so they can then misrepresent what we're saying and doing, because that's the key.
[02:43:50.689 --> 02:43:51.909]  You think, oh, I've been silenced.
[02:43:51.949 --> 02:43:53.090]  I don't want to be public anyways.
[02:43:53.650 --> 02:43:56.631]  Once they silence you, well, you hear them.
[02:43:56.651 --> 02:43:58.532]  They tell you they live in the Midwest or the South or
[02:43:59.685 --> 02:44:01.066]  Southwest, you're a Nazi!
[02:44:01.386 --> 02:44:02.106]  And you're like, what?
[02:44:03.066 --> 02:44:04.747]  But see, they want to dehumanize you.
[02:44:05.047 --> 02:44:12.670]  And that's why you being vocal... See, you're not on a power trip like a leftist who thinks whatever they say is like God said it.
[02:44:13.791 --> 02:44:14.511]  No, you're not God.
[02:44:15.071 --> 02:44:17.152]  But you're not going to let them steal your voice.
[02:44:17.572 --> 02:44:22.194]  That's why your voice being heard is so critical so they can't steal your identity.
[02:44:23.148 --> 02:44:24.409]  So this is like a 10-minute video.
[02:44:24.429 --> 02:44:26.210]  The full video is up on Infowars.com.
[02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:29.392]  The War Room, Owen Schroer, Savannah Hernandez is about to take over.
[02:44:29.412 --> 02:44:33.614]  But this is the video that YouTube just removed.
[02:44:35.275 --> 02:44:37.096]  So let that sink in in America.
[02:44:37.697 --> 02:44:40.619]  AI systems watching and blocking what a U.S.
[02:44:40.659 --> 02:44:44.241]  Senator says, and Trump won't do anything about it.
[02:44:44.761 --> 02:44:49.544]  And his Justice Department just announced that these companies can do this.
[02:44:50.084 --> 02:44:50.925]  They can election mail.
[02:44:52.076 --> 02:45:01.860]  Well I hope Trump doesn't wake up in 263 days and he's just lost the 2020 election because this is illegal what's going on.
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:02.801]  Here's the report.
[02:45:03.841 --> 02:45:07.543]  Now during the proceedings I asked a question that was disallowed.
[02:45:08.083 --> 02:45:09.764]  Let's be clear, Senate video deleted.
[02:45:10.868 --> 02:45:15.330]  Because the Constitution does protect debate and does protect the asking of questions.
[02:45:16.011 --> 02:45:18.472]  I think they made a big mistake not allowing my question.
[02:45:19.232 --> 02:45:22.834]  My question did not talk about anybody who is a whistleblower.
[02:45:23.335 --> 02:45:26.356]  My question did not accuse anybody of being a whistleblower.
[02:45:26.857 --> 02:45:30.779]  It did not make a statement believing that someone was a whistleblower.
[02:45:31.139 --> 02:45:33.000]  I simply named two people's names.
[02:45:33.500 --> 02:45:36.662]  Because I think it's very important to know what happened.
[02:45:37.122 --> 02:45:50.047]  We're now finding out that the FISA investigation was predicated upon 17 lies by the FBI, by people at high levels who were biased against the President, and it turns out it was an illegitimate investigation.
[02:45:50.447 --> 02:45:57.749]  Everything they did about investigating the President was untrue and abused government to do something they never should have done in the first place.
[02:45:58.230 --> 02:46:01.211]  So I ask this question, and this is my question.
[02:46:02.111 --> 02:46:04.012]  My exact question, we'll put it up here.
[02:46:04.813 --> 02:46:15.399]  Are you aware that the House Intelligence Committee staffer, Sean Misko, had a close relationship with Eric Chiramella while at the National Security Council together?
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:28.888]  Are you aware, and how would you respond to reports that Chiramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal House impeachment proceedings?
[02:46:29.761 --> 02:46:31.082]  And why did I ask this question?
[02:46:31.682 --> 02:46:48.650]  Because there are news reports saying these two people, one of them who works for Adam Schiff and one of them who worked with this person at the National Security Council, that they knew each other and had been overheard talking about impeaching the president in the first month of his office.
[02:46:49.011 --> 02:46:53.333]  In January of 2017, they were already plotting the impeachment.
[02:46:54.013 --> 02:46:59.616]  And you say, well, we should protect the whistleblower and the whistleblower deserves anonymity.
[02:47:01.097 --> 02:47:02.077]  So no due process.
[02:47:02.117 --> 02:47:06.920]  And again, I was pointing out there that there is a 10 minute video.
[02:47:09.921 --> 02:47:11.382]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:47:11.462 --> 02:47:12.802]  It has the full speech they deleted.
[02:47:12.822 --> 02:47:15.364]  That was just a short minute and a half, two minute clip of it.
[02:47:15.404 --> 02:47:16.724]  But think about that.
[02:47:17.065 --> 02:47:19.626]  You're watching a U.S.
[02:47:19.666 --> 02:47:21.247]  senator in the well of the Senate.
[02:47:22.107 --> 02:47:23.588]  And that's the video they took down.
[02:47:25.111 --> 02:47:29.412]  So, does big tech have riches that are too big?
[02:47:30.712 --> 02:47:30.952]  Yeah.
[02:47:32.353 --> 02:47:35.953]  And everybody just treats it like it's, well, it's that fancy thing over there.
[02:47:36.014 --> 02:47:37.034]  It's high tech.
[02:47:37.454 --> 02:47:38.774]  We just can't do anything about it.
[02:47:39.434 --> 02:47:47.416]  We can't do anything now that Senator Paul can't talk in the Senate, and that's taken down.
[02:47:47.556 --> 02:47:50.477]  And then, by the way, Google's like, yeah, that's not allowed.
[02:47:50.517 --> 02:47:51.057]  We took him down.
[02:47:53.922 --> 02:47:55.662]  Google helped censor in China.
[02:47:56.483 --> 02:48:00.284]  They helped censor all over the world.
[02:48:01.704 --> 02:48:03.665]  And then we sit here and we put up with that?
[02:48:05.305 --> 02:48:08.526]  Everybody asked me two years ago when I got banned everywhere, they said, how are you taking it?
[02:48:08.546 --> 02:48:11.147]  And I said, well, how are you taking it?
[02:48:11.187 --> 02:48:12.627]  Because this is an attack on you.
[02:48:14.248 --> 02:48:16.908]  The things they said I did that I got banned for, I didn't do.
[02:48:17.128 --> 02:48:22.110]  But I knew I was chosen as a colorful character that they thought they could shut down.
[02:48:22.150 --> 02:48:23.090]  It was major pressure.
[02:48:24.434 --> 02:48:26.495]  On the White House and everybody else to go along with it.
[02:48:26.715 --> 02:48:30.457]  And at a certain point, I just said, hey, stop worrying about me.
[02:48:30.577 --> 02:48:31.898]  Go ahead and let me get banned.
[02:48:33.739 --> 02:48:35.900]  But it's gonna be everybody else you gotta worry about next week.
[02:48:35.940 --> 02:48:36.901]  That's what Zuckerberg said.
[02:48:37.061 --> 02:48:39.602]  Oh, Jones wanted to be banned.
[02:48:40.203 --> 02:48:41.183]  No, I didn't wanna be banned.
[02:48:41.984 --> 02:48:46.586]  I just understood the formality of it's Alex Jones today, it's all of you tomorrow.
[02:48:49.328 --> 02:48:51.149]  So people walk to me on the street and they say, Alex,
[02:48:52.398 --> 02:48:54.320]  I'm really sad about you getting shadowbanned everywhere.
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:54.980]  How you taking it?
[02:48:55.020 --> 02:48:55.481]  I'm not looking.
[02:48:55.521 --> 02:49:00.706]  I'm like, uh... It's like a forest fire coming through your town and burning everybody's houses.
[02:49:01.086 --> 02:49:02.127]  My house burnt down too.
[02:49:02.167 --> 02:49:02.708]  So is yours.
[02:49:02.728 --> 02:49:03.829]  You're asking me how I'm doing?
[02:49:04.069 --> 02:49:04.730]  That's stupid.
[02:49:04.930 --> 02:49:05.951]  It already burnt down.
[02:49:06.271 --> 02:49:07.512]  It's a dumb statement.
[02:49:08.974 --> 02:49:10.415]  This is affecting everybody.
[02:49:13.243 --> 02:49:16.023]  And see, collectivists never care about the collective.
[02:49:16.464 --> 02:49:18.504]  I'm an individualist, so I do care about the collective.
[02:49:19.144 --> 02:49:23.565]  I'm an individualist, I'm free, but I do care about the collective, so I'm always thinking about that.
[02:49:23.585 --> 02:49:25.005]  So I'm not thinking about me.
[02:49:25.465 --> 02:49:31.166]  I'm thinking about how I was used as the precedent to get all this done, and now it's being done.
[02:49:31.666 --> 02:49:41.388]  And what is the Senate gonna do when the deep state says, you can't show a U.S.
[02:49:41.448 --> 02:49:41.788]  Senator
[02:49:43.396 --> 02:49:54.346]  In 2020, talking about a witness who we should be able to face as an accuser, and now they've taken it down.
[02:49:55.387 --> 02:49:58.189]  So I'll say this, I don't think America is this wimpy.
[02:49:58.409 --> 02:49:59.951]  I don't think America is this pathetic.
[02:50:00.051 --> 02:50:01.132]  I don't think we're this bad.
[02:50:02.553 --> 02:50:04.515]  I think they're good people in the US Senate overall.
[02:50:05.106 --> 02:50:08.567]  I think there's people in the government that understand this is dangerous and in private life.
[02:50:08.667 --> 02:50:17.289]  And I believe that Google and Apple and all these jerk-off organizations that are so arrogant are going to get cut down to size.
[02:50:18.090 --> 02:50:20.130]  Because if I owned a company that wouldn't let a U.S.
[02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:22.931]  Senator give his speech, I think I would get in trouble.
[02:50:23.051 --> 02:50:23.931]  I would fear that.
[02:50:24.811 --> 02:50:27.132]  But these people at Google, they just think they're invincible.
[02:50:27.712 --> 02:50:29.933]  So it's in the Senate's hands now.
[02:50:42.967 --> 02:50:46.712]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:50:47.252 --> 02:50:50.497]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:50:50.757 --> 02:50:53.420]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:50:54.021 --> 02:50:56.905]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:50:57.586 --> 02:50:59.228]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:50:59.808 --> 02:51:01.269]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:51:01.889 --> 02:51:06.991]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:51:07.372 --> 02:51:15.295]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:51:15.836 --> 02:51:22.218]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:51:22.539 --> 02:51:25.340]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:51:34.983 --> 02:51:45.709]  I told you two weeks ago that almost all the other major food distributors were actually sold out of food and trying to now buy up more food.
[02:51:46.527 --> 02:52:00.496]  But that our big sponsor that we've had for over 10 years, MyPayToSupply, had plenty of food on hand, but they were honest that there was a 7 to 10 day wait because they had to package it running 24 hours a day, three or four times the biggest volume of ordering that they've ever seen.
[02:52:01.076 --> 02:52:12.363]  With Homeland Security and with FEMA and with the Office of Personnel, all of them trying to call and buy up whatever food they had for their quarantine centers around the United States.
[02:52:12.523 --> 02:52:13.583]  Remember, that was two weeks ago.
[02:52:13.603 --> 02:52:17.925]  I told you they're setting up quarantine centers, and they want emergency backup food for folks inside quarantine centers.
[02:52:18.205 --> 02:52:18.785]  And the U.S.
[02:52:18.805 --> 02:52:22.406]  government already has huge stockpiles of affordable food, so why would they be wanting even more?
[02:52:22.426 --> 02:52:28.568]  Because a lot of it's 20, 30 years old, and the government employees want good stuff, and they know MyPatriot's good, but they're buying up everything already.
[02:52:28.628 --> 02:52:31.089]  Now, a lot of these other companies, I don't have them as sponsors.
[02:52:31.169 --> 02:52:33.090]  I could have six, seven food sponsors right now.
[02:52:33.210 --> 02:52:39.052]  I don't, because I learned early on, if there's not a big rush, and there's nothing going on, they got the food, and, you know, it's okay.
[02:52:39.372 --> 02:52:39.773]  We're good to go.
[02:52:56.730 --> 02:52:59.731]  And you get it just as fast as anybody else that orders from them.
[02:53:00.011 --> 02:53:01.212]  And it supports the operation.
[02:53:01.452 --> 02:53:03.413]  And now it's 10 to 14 days.
[02:53:03.593 --> 02:53:05.133]  They're right at about 10 days right now.
[02:53:05.193 --> 02:53:08.234]  I just wanted to say 10 to 14 because the orders aren't going down.
[02:53:08.274 --> 02:53:11.556]  They're intensifying because folks know this is really serious now.
[02:53:11.616 --> 02:53:19.639]  But for 2020, for economic issues down the road, for inflation, for a possible depression, for any reason, this is insurance you can eat.
[02:53:20.239 --> 02:53:22.782]  This is stuff that you can save and know that you're always going to use.
[02:53:22.802 --> 02:53:25.704]  If you don't use your car insurance or your medical, well, it's money lost.
[02:53:25.764 --> 02:53:29.068]  But with this, it tastes as good as 10 years as it does today.
[02:53:29.208 --> 02:53:33.152]  And a lot of this food is indistinguishable from gourmet-type stuff you get at the store.
[02:53:33.212 --> 02:53:34.233]  Some of it tastes okay.
[02:53:34.273 --> 02:53:37.296]  But for the price, you're getting the best high-quality stuff there is out there.
[02:53:37.336 --> 02:53:38.317]  Nobody can come close.
[02:53:38.377 --> 02:53:40.018]  They're cheaper than all the major competitors.
[02:53:40.218 --> 02:53:43.241]  And they want to be so that you come back to them over and over again.
[02:53:43.261 --> 02:53:44.863]  They're now the biggest storable food company.
[02:53:44.963 --> 02:53:47.947]  In the United States, they have the great Alexa Pure filtration.
[02:53:48.067 --> 02:53:48.969]  You see it's top rated.
[02:53:49.029 --> 02:53:51.612]  Their air filter is top rated, but half the price of competitors.
[02:53:51.793 --> 02:53:53.174]  They have the same philosophy as I do.
[02:53:53.194 --> 02:54:00.945]  So I want to go out and get one sponsor, one supplier that's just good year after year, that you get a great response from, that I use, and that you get quality products from.
[02:54:01.085 --> 02:54:02.107]  And so, it's there.
[02:54:02.287 --> 02:54:14.230]  It's available right now, and I would advise everybody, if you've been on the fence about a four-week supply, about a three-month supply, about a six-month supply, about a year's supply, this is something that everybody that can should have.
[02:54:14.290 --> 02:54:17.871]  And it's in these great, high-quality plastic tote containers that are sealed.
[02:54:17.971 --> 02:54:20.492]  Then it's got sealed packaging inside of that.
[02:54:20.572 --> 02:54:21.932]  It's absolutely filled to the brim.
[02:54:22.072 --> 02:54:23.793]  You're not paying for air here, folks.
[02:54:23.933 --> 02:54:25.853]  This is the best bang for your buck out there.
[02:54:25.933 --> 02:54:28.074]  That's why they are our
[02:54:28.294 --> 02:54:28.814]  Supplier.
[02:54:28.914 --> 02:54:29.754]  So don't wait anymore.
[02:54:29.774 --> 02:54:31.495]  Go to M4store.com.
[02:54:31.515 --> 02:54:36.656]  Get your order in today and know that you will be at the front of the line to get it as quickly as possible.
[02:54:36.696 --> 02:54:38.897]  You get it in, it's guaranteed 10 to 14 days.
[02:54:38.997 --> 02:54:39.777]  They have the food.
[02:54:39.957 --> 02:54:43.818]  It's just that they've got to package it and it is crazy, the volume.
[02:54:43.958 --> 02:54:45.799]  It just does not exist out there.
[02:54:46.039 --> 02:54:51.581]  And I was there two weeks ago and they were saying, should we spend everything we get coming in to order more food for other folks?
[02:54:51.601 --> 02:54:52.581]  Do you think this is how bad?
[02:54:52.641 --> 02:54:54.842]  I said, yeah, no, I think your gut level's right.
[02:54:54.882 --> 02:54:55.702]  I said, go all in.
[02:54:56.702 --> 02:55:01.645]  I think unfortunately, you know, in a month you'll be selling more food than you are now, because I think this is pretty serious.
[02:55:01.665 --> 02:55:03.066]  The response we're seeing is really serious.
[02:55:03.106 --> 02:55:04.506]  And regardless, 2020 is a crazy year.
[02:55:04.526 --> 02:55:05.667]  People need to be prepared.
[02:55:06.407 --> 02:55:09.909]  And so they've purchased a ton more food, and it's all coming in, all getting ready.
[02:55:09.929 --> 02:55:14.252]  But you order now, you're ordering food they have in stock that you will get.
[02:55:14.332 --> 02:55:15.852]  But I would not wait any more.
[02:55:15.933 --> 02:55:16.573]  What's going on?
[02:55:17.113 --> 02:55:19.154]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:19.194 --> 02:55:23.136]  They have a lot of specialty meals, you name it.
[02:55:23.677 --> 02:55:24.457]  Amazing food.
[02:55:24.497 --> 02:55:24.917]  Get it today.
[02:55:35.020 --> 02:55:45.511]  I almost feel opportunistic when I'm positioned with the very nano-silver that the Pentagon and Homeland Security has said has been proven to take out SARS.
[02:55:45.712 --> 02:55:46.232]  But you know what?
[02:55:46.352 --> 02:55:47.433]  I've been selling it for years.
[02:55:47.714 --> 02:55:49.155]  So, that's what this comes down to.
[02:55:49.315 --> 02:55:53.560]  I sold out of this yesterday, as I told you, but still kept it discounted, the 16-ounce bottles.
[02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:57.041]  We're selling out of the one ounce bottles very, very quickly as well.
[02:55:57.061 --> 02:55:58.002]  A little spray bottle.
[02:55:58.022 --> 02:56:00.023]  This will sell out within a week, the three ounce bottles.
[02:56:00.183 --> 02:56:01.283]  And it's just high quality.
[02:56:01.463 --> 02:56:02.503]  And is it a silver bullet?
[02:56:02.664 --> 02:56:09.286]  No, but they call it a silver bullet in lore because silver is just a metal-based antibiotic type system.
[02:56:09.486 --> 02:56:10.807]  And again, it's not perfect.
[02:56:10.887 --> 02:56:11.867]  Consult your physician.
[02:56:12.007 --> 02:56:13.748]  It's something that I normally just gargle with.
[02:56:13.968 --> 02:56:18.636]  Couple times a week, but you can actually, this is approved to drink, that's why it's at 15 parts, but it's nano.
[02:56:18.776 --> 02:56:24.786]  Just remember, any antibiotic, whether it's classic antibiotics or whether it's metals-based, has its downside as well.
[02:56:26.209 --> 02:56:29.210]  My dad was basically on death's doorstep six years ago.
[02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:34.871]  My uncle, his uncle, and my cousin had all died, lived at the same ranch, from the same bad pneumonia.
[02:56:35.551 --> 02:56:37.231]  I came in when the doctors couldn't help my dad.
[02:56:37.251 --> 02:56:38.392]  He'd been on three different antibiotics.
[02:56:39.012 --> 02:56:43.553]  I could tell he was going the same way, and I just basically assaulted him and poured three bottles of chloral silver down him.
[02:56:43.993 --> 02:56:45.173]  Well, this was even better than that.
[02:56:45.213 --> 02:56:46.773]  By the way, my dad pissed green for a week.
[02:56:47.193 --> 02:56:49.754]  Sure wasn't good for his liver and kidneys, but he came back and lived, okay?
[02:56:50.194 --> 02:56:51.155]  Am I saying that did that?
[02:56:51.655 --> 02:56:54.116]  I just didn't put it in in God's hands.
[02:56:54.156 --> 02:56:56.317]  I took action because God helps those that help themselves.
[02:56:56.858 --> 02:57:00.139]  So what I'm getting at here is we're selling out of this silver.
[02:57:00.179 --> 02:57:01.320]  We're keeping it discounted.
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:02.681]  We're sold out of the colloil silver.
[02:57:02.701 --> 02:57:03.881]  That hadn't come back in yet.
[02:57:04.822 --> 02:57:06.523]  It was already sold out before this crisis began.
[02:57:06.543 --> 02:57:08.844]  We have the great storable foods in case you've got a shelter in place.
[02:57:09.324 --> 02:57:12.027]  But I have that just because you should be self-sufficient and ready.
[02:57:12.367 --> 02:57:14.949]  All the other big suppliers we know of have already sold out.
[02:57:14.969 --> 02:57:16.230]  They're still taking your orders.
[02:57:16.671 --> 02:57:18.492]  Our supplier has the food.
[02:57:18.512 --> 02:57:19.433]  They've got to package it.
[02:57:19.613 --> 02:57:23.397]  And they called me two days ago and said, you got to tell listeners it's now 10 to 14.
[02:57:23.497 --> 02:57:24.698]  I said, is it really 10 to 14?
[02:57:24.878 --> 02:57:26.800]  They said, yeah, in a few days.
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:27.921]  It'll certainly be in 10 days.
[02:57:27.981 --> 02:57:30.784]  And then we've got the food, but it's just that it's increasing.
[02:57:30.844 --> 02:57:32.365]  Institutional buyers are trying to buy it up.
[02:57:32.465 --> 02:57:33.566]  And that's what scares them.
[02:57:33.746 --> 02:57:35.688]  I had talks two weeks ago with the owner and the
[02:57:35.828 --> 02:57:36.448]  I don't know.
[02:57:51.414 --> 02:57:54.195]  And sure enough, unfortunately, you see this is serious.
[02:57:54.235 --> 02:57:55.615]  So, it's good to be prepared.
[02:57:55.815 --> 02:57:56.835]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:57:56.895 --> 02:57:58.975]  It funds our independent Maverick operation.
[02:57:59.316 --> 02:57:59.916]  It's storable food.
[02:57:59.936 --> 02:58:00.616]  It's high quality.
[02:58:00.996 --> 02:58:03.756]  And we have the best nano silver you're going to find out there.
[02:58:03.776 --> 02:58:06.777]  I mean, the super silver wound gel is the same nano, but it's super strong.
[02:58:06.817 --> 02:58:07.757]  You can't ingest this.
[02:58:07.777 --> 02:58:09.678]  This is private labeled in stores.
[02:58:10.138 --> 02:58:11.158]  They have this in hospitals.
[02:58:11.498 --> 02:58:12.598]  These are great patriots.
[02:58:12.618 --> 02:58:13.658]  And here's the company right here.
[02:58:13.958 --> 02:58:14.839]  They want their name said.
[02:58:14.879 --> 02:58:16.799]  I've been with them like six, seven years, but
[02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:20.345]  It's American Biotech Labs out of Colorado.
[02:58:20.445 --> 02:58:26.356]  Here's all the Pentagon documents, Department of the Army, Headquarters Army, Homeland Security, A&M, talking about how amazing it is.
[02:58:26.416 --> 02:58:27.237]  Is it a silver bullet?
[02:58:27.277 --> 02:58:29.842]  No, but it's just one more defense and it funds the M4.
