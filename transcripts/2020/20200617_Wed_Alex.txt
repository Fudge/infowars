[00:00:09.953 --> 00:00:11.093]  Big Brother.
[00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:12.894]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:14.794]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:16.495]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:18.136]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:24.838]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:26.519]  Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex today.
[00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.520]  We will be hearing from Alex coming up in the next segment and more.
[00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:45.470]  But the agitation left is in full-time war mode to divide America and destroy America.
[00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:56.159]  And I didn't even notice this yesterday, but I had the Austin Americans statement, statesman, the Austin anti-American statesman, if more accurately said,
[00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:02.243]  But this is from Friday, but just look at what they put here for you on the front fold.
[00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:03.687]  Is it me?
[00:01:03.687 --> 00:01:05.428]  Is it?
[00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:08.089]  Or is it a racist thing?
[00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:09.690]  So, hitting you with racist.
[00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.651]  Again, racism in the live music capital of the world.
[00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:17.273]  Four performers talk about what it's like to be a black musician in Austin.
[00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:19.254]  So, just pounding you with the racism.
[00:01:19.254 --> 00:01:23.015]  Then it's two longhorns test positive for coronavirus.
[00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.236]  Oh, now they're hitting you with the COVID too.
[00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:27.877]  Oh, second wave of virus feared.
[00:01:27.877 --> 00:01:29.378]  Coronavirus pandemic.
[00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.242]  Another one, Confederate memorials under fire once again.
[00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:46.894]  So just, I guarantee you, every leftist liberal publication is doing this to their local cities every damn day.
[00:01:46.894 --> 00:01:53.761]  And all of the issues that the left claims to have in America are all fundamentally
[00:01:54.918 --> 00:02:00.920]  Results and symptoms of the leftist ideology and the leftist policy.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.920]  But!
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.361]  They say black lives matter.
[00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:09.222]  Do black lives really matter to a liberal?
[00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:12.983]  Do black lives really matter to a democrat?
[00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:14.744]  Well one black man wanted to find out.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.866]  So he went to a hospital where a bunch of virtue-signaling hospital workers were taking a knee outside for Black Lives Matter.
[00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:26.009]  He went to find out if they actually cared about black lives.
[00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.669]  Here's how it went.
[00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:31.814]  Black Lives Matter or just some black lives?
[00:02:31.814 --> 00:02:35.917]  The black lives killed by black men matter, right?
[00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:37.498]  Yes?
[00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:41.401]  The black babies killed in the abortions clinics matter, right?
[00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:41.842]  Thought so.
[00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:48.580]  The black officers killed by that bastard in Minnesota, that matters too, right?
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.241]  Okay.
[00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:53.283]  But the black babies that are killed in the abortion clinics don't matter, do they?
[00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:55.344]  Medical people.
[00:02:55.344 --> 00:02:57.646]  Do their lives matter?
[00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:00.868]  Does the future of our black babies matter?
[00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:01.688]  Huh?
[00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:02.548]  What's up?
[00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:03.009]  What's up?
[00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:05.210]  Awful quiet now, aren't they?
[00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.371]  Uh-huh.
[00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:08.472]  It's okay if we kill them in the womb, right?
[00:03:10.247 --> 00:03:15.529]  But you have a problem when we, you don't seem to really have a problem when we kill them on the streets.
[00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.870]  Yes, well we know they're the same issue.
[00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:28.895]  If we don't respect the lives of our unborn children enough to save them and fight for them, our lives mean nothing once we're born.
[00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:29.175]  Folks,
[00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:40.196]  If you're new to Infowars or you're new to politics and you see a lot of this stuff and it's just not really making sense to you, why is the left like this?
[00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:41.397]  Why do they say these things?
[00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:42.578]  Why do they do these things?
[00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:43.478]  Who are these people?
[00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:44.459]  What is motivating them?
[00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.801]  What is driving them?
[00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:54.145]  What you're witnessing is years of propaganda in the universities,
[00:03:56.124 --> 00:04:13.170]  In mainstream media, news, entertainment, sports, Hollywood, the Democrat Party lies, and now the censorship and rewriting of history by Google and other big tech industry.
[00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:23.474]  And so yeah, you got a bunch of morons out there taking a knee when they see a black guy coming up, asking them if black lives matter, because that's how they've been taught, that's how they've been programmed and conditioned.
[00:04:24.707 --> 00:04:25.848]  And they really believe it!
[00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:31.134]  They really think that if you're black in America, it's just so bad for you.
[00:04:31.134 --> 00:04:34.157]  And you're really a victim of racism and oppression.
[00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:34.738]  But you know what?
[00:04:34.738 --> 00:04:36.379]  There's a really dark...
[00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:41.496]  The truth to that, that they won't tell you, and maybe I'll say it today.
[00:04:41.496 --> 00:04:44.577]  But I'm white, so I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about these things.
[00:04:44.577 --> 00:04:45.737]  Ol' Whitey.
[00:04:45.737 --> 00:04:48.238]  How come they haven't cancelled the Cracker Barrel yet, by the way?
[00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:50.778]  Aunt Jemima, she's gone.
[00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:51.739]  See ya, Aunt Jemima.
[00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:53.339]  No more syrup for you.
[00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:54.519]  Is Cracker Barrel next?
[00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:56.380]  Or let's rename it to Honky Barrel, maybe.
[00:04:58.587 --> 00:05:02.629]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.209]  The first of its kind.
[00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:09.172]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[00:05:09.172 --> 00:05:12.193]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[00:05:12.193 --> 00:05:15.274]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:18.776]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:21.057]  You've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house, it's
[00:05:21.437 --> 00:05:31.939]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car, it's great to keep with you, and again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.480]  We're really excited about it.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.620]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:47.123]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new, and in some ways, even better way.
[00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:57.991]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at infowarestore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[00:06:10.051 --> 00:06:15.683]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:06:15.683 --> 00:06:18.048]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.636 --> 00:06:46.662]  And we need to do much more within the criminal justice system, but also within all of our systems, to dismantle the structures of racism that our federal, state, and local governments carefully erected and maintained over centuries.
[00:06:46.662 --> 00:06:49.284]  We know a little bit about this in Virginia.
[00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:52.405]  The first African Americans into the English colonies came to
[00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:54.989]  Quaint Comfort, Virginia in 1619.
[00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:55.729]  They were slaves.
[00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.851]  They'd been captured against their will.
[00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:01.014]  But they landed in colonies that didn't have slavery.
[00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:05.778]  There were no laws about slavery in the colonies at that time.
[00:07:05.778 --> 00:07:08.560]  The United States didn't inherit slavery from anybody.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.922]  We created it.
[00:07:09.922 --> 00:07:14.125]  It got created by the Virginia General Assembly and the legislatures of other states.
[00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:20.708]  Why would Senator Tim Kaine tell a lie so big, so massive, so over-the-top ridiculous?
[00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:22.789]  I'll explain why in a moment.
[00:07:30.523 --> 00:07:35.306]  But first, it's critical to understand that the United States did inherit slavery.
[00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:45.013]  And it was England, and then the United States later, that led the world in eradicating it in almost every part of the planet except the Middle East and Africa.
[00:07:45.013 --> 00:07:47.814]  Slavery is as old as recorded history.
[00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:55.292]  It's documented going back over 10,000 years and took place in every culture.
[00:07:55.292 --> 00:07:56.714]  It is in the Bible.
[00:07:56.714 --> 00:07:58.456]  It is in the Koran.
[00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:01.259]  It is in the Roman and Greek histories.
[00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:03.541]  It is in the Chinese histories.
[00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:06.725]  It is a evil institution.
[00:08:06.725 --> 00:08:08.947]  And we're going back into a form of globalist slavery.
[00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:20.205]  Today, and a new class system where the establishment has total surveillance grids over we the people, has access to medical care and information that we don't have access to.
[00:08:20.205 --> 00:08:23.168]  This is a new form of slavery.
[00:08:23.168 --> 00:08:31.896]  But to say that the West is guilty of the original sin of slavery and that we created it or progenerated it
[00:08:32.897 --> 00:08:41.501]  Is an assault on the idea of the West itself and the Renaissance that actually began the process of empowering humanity and ending slavery.
[00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:52.025]  So it's direct assault on the Western open free society that the globalist model that is a true modern form of high-tech slavery is directly at loggerheads with.
[00:08:52.965 --> 00:09:07.452]  And so that's why Tim Kaine, the globalist, the Jesuit operative, and his Antifa son, who's been arrested, and all the rest of them, continue to lie like this, because they are assaulting reality on purpose.
[00:09:07.452 --> 00:09:14.555]  They're training you that they tell you lies, that there aren't two genders, that there are no borders, no walls.
[00:09:14.975 --> 00:09:26.989]  That America's evil, that our police are the worst on the planet, while they themselves at the United Nations carry out the most brutal mass murders and exterminations and enslavement the planet's ever seen.
[00:09:26.989 --> 00:09:28.431]  I mean, literally.
[00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:34.798]  It is on record that Apple runs the worst slave factories on the planet and that 3 million Uyghurs in China
[00:09:35.947 --> 00:09:36.187]  I think?
[00:09:52.726 --> 00:10:00.273]  For 150 years before there were any slaves in North America, there were slaves in the Caribbean under the Spanish and the Portuguese.
[00:10:00.273 --> 00:10:02.474]  That's why a lot of Africans got brought to the Caribbean.
[00:10:02.474 --> 00:10:04.256]  That's why there's Africans all over the Caribbean.
[00:10:04.256 --> 00:10:12.262]  That's why in Brazil there's so many black people because they were brought there by the Portuguese 400 plus years ago and the Spanish again.
[00:10:13.323 --> 00:10:17.208]  Slavery didn't even get cranky here until about 300 years ago.
[00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:19.912]  And it only operated for about 150 years.
[00:10:19.912 --> 00:10:23.296]  But facts don't supposedly matter to these people.
[00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:25.659]  They just tell whatever outrageous lies they want.
[00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:28.282]  These are despicable, degenerate pieces of trash.
[00:10:28.282 --> 00:10:30.906]  But of course, he made a great running mate with Hillary, didn't he?
[00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:38.470]  Because they love to scientifically condition us to accept their lying scams, their total giant frauds.
[00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:51.097]  And their ignorant followers actually hear this and will now pick it up as a talking point even though most of them know it's not true because they have converted their followers into willing accomplices in their criminal takeover.
[00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:58.621]  And that's why they're an un-American party that is hell-bent with foreign collaborator operations and quislings to overthrow this country.
[00:10:58.621 --> 00:11:06.225]  And that's why we have to completely break with these individuals and not give them, you know, any sucker, any support.
[00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:14.990]  You have to challenge them and get in their face and denounce them as the anti-American, anti-freedom, abortion, eugenics, globalist, loving trash they are.
[00:11:16.553 --> 00:11:28.117]  It really is incredible to think Tim Kaine would have been the Vice President of the United States, an evil man, a wicked man, who has such a snake tongue.
[00:11:28.117 --> 00:11:33.979]  He tells lies with no hesitation at all.
[00:11:33.979 --> 00:11:34.239]  None.
[00:11:34.239 --> 00:11:40.861]  In fact, the first slaves brought to what we know as modern-day America were actually Irish.
[00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:48.202]  The African slaves that Tim Kaine is talking about were brought over here by Africans.
[00:11:48.202 --> 00:12:07.633]  And even more ironic enough, if you believe this, I mean, you don't have to believe it, it's the truth, the old kente cloth scarf that they wore was actually a slave trade Ghanese tribe that originated that.
[00:12:07.633 --> 00:12:08.574]  That was their marking.
[00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:22.115]  And they used to go, this tribe that wore the kente cloth, it was theirs, that was their mark, they used to go around Africa, conquering land, taking the people, and then selling them into slavery.
[00:12:22.115 --> 00:12:24.636]  Literally, that's where that scarf comes from.
[00:12:24.636 --> 00:12:34.644]  And then the Democrats put it on and claim they're anti-slavery, when Tim Kaine, who would have been the Vice President under Hillary Clinton, tells you that the United States created slavery.
[00:12:34.644 --> 00:12:37.786]  A massive whopper of a lie you couldn't believe,
[00:12:39.266 --> 00:12:44.128]  If you saw it in a movie or read it in a sci-fi novel or anything.
[00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:48.669]  But that's what the Democrats do now, is they go to the full extreme.
[00:12:48.669 --> 00:12:58.272]  Hey, we're going to virtue signal wearing a kente cloth that was actually the symbolic cloth of the number one slave trade in West Africa group.
[00:12:58.272 --> 00:13:00.733]  Don't worry, our constituents are stupid.
[00:13:00.733 --> 00:13:03.133]  They'll never know.
[00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:04.994]  Tim Kaine says we created slavery.
[00:13:04.994 --> 00:13:08.195]  He knows that's not true, but he knows his constituents are
[00:13:09.212 --> 00:13:11.414]  Dumber than a box of rocks.
[00:13:11.414 --> 00:13:17.619]  And they know they can go out and create race crime and violence against white people, which is what they're doing now.
[00:13:17.619 --> 00:13:26.726]  And by the way, I mean, I played about six clips yesterday of all the anti-white hate crime that's going on in this country.
[00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:30.369]  There's another one today that we have of a guy at the mall.
[00:13:33.302 --> 00:13:38.405]  You know, I hate to be the one that has to say this, but I don't think anybody else will.
[00:13:38.405 --> 00:13:43.708]  So maybe I should be the one that says it.
[00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:59.357]  Jay-Z and rap gang-banging culture brought to you by Democrats bringing in crack to your inner cities.
[00:13:59.357 --> 00:14:00.118]  Brought to you by
[00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:06.834]  Yeah, you want to talk about a agenda to get black people, it's in the rap industry.
[00:14:06.834 --> 00:14:17.701]  That's why you don't have Louis Armstrong and Nat King Cole or Aretha Franklin or any of those great musicians that wore classy dresses and suits and ties.
[00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:21.063]  No, now you get Jay-Z and the gang-banging culture is black culture.
[00:14:21.063 --> 00:14:23.724]  That was done by the CIA.
[00:14:23.724 --> 00:14:26.766]  Call it a deep state program.
[00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:28.327]  Yeah, the Democrats were behind it.
[00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:29.588]  Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[00:14:29.588 --> 00:14:30.469]  Probably Joe Biden, too.
[00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.235]  He's been around long enough to be a part of all this.
[00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:40.322]  And so... Play that B-roll again.
[00:14:40.322 --> 00:14:44.648]  Here's a guy at a mall who decides he's just gonna beat up a white man senselessly.
[00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:49.769]  He's got, of course, his drawers below his butthole because that means he's gay.
[00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:50.810]  He doesn't realize that.
[00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:59.338]  That was programmed into him by the rap industry, which he obviously listens to, and so he thinks that behaving like a thug is now his culture because that's what Jay-Z taught him.
[00:14:59.338 --> 00:15:04.202]  So he doesn't even realize that he's actually asking you to have gay sex with him in the butt.
[00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:05.724]  I'm not trying to be funny here, folks.
[00:15:05.724 --> 00:15:06.544]  That's what this is.
[00:15:07.205 --> 00:15:12.347]  It was well-known in prison, you wore your pants below your butt, that means, hey, I'm open for business.
[00:15:12.347 --> 00:15:20.409]  But then they brought it into the rap industry and they made it black culture as a big joke for black people, because that's what the Democrats are doing to you.
[00:15:20.409 --> 00:15:24.290]  Folks, do you want to know the truth?
[00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.151]  Because, by the way, the guy says, oh, he called me the N-word, so I can just beat him up.
[00:15:28.151 --> 00:15:31.753]  So that'll be the new excuse black people are using to create hate crimes against white people.
[00:15:31.753 --> 00:15:32.753]  But here's the truth, folks.
[00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:51.639]  It was Jay-Z and it was the rap industry with MTV and all the other people involved that made black people, young black men, not want to be men and godly men and strong men and leaders, but made them want to be n-words.
[00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:52.140]  That's what it is.
[00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:56.703]  That was an insult, and now it's a joke, and black men are calling each other that word.
[00:15:56.703 --> 00:15:57.684]  It's a big joke.
[00:15:57.684 --> 00:16:00.067]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[00:16:00.067 --> 00:16:06.034]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[00:16:06.034 --> 00:16:09.979]  But, we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[00:16:11.129 --> 00:16:12.770]  That is amazing.
[00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:20.433]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[00:16:20.433 --> 00:16:22.774]  And there's another innovation.
[00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:24.855]  It's the spray cap.
[00:16:24.855 --> 00:16:30.257]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[00:16:30.257 --> 00:16:32.438]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[00:16:32.438 --> 00:16:33.339]  I like to put it on my hands.
[00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:35.600]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.420]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.001]  But I just love it.
[00:16:40.001 --> 00:16:42.822]  Personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[00:16:42.822 --> 00:16:44.602]  So, this is a real innovation.
[00:16:44.602 --> 00:16:51.125]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[00:16:51.125 --> 00:16:52.485]  Smells great.
[00:16:52.485 --> 00:16:54.306]  It's so refreshing.
[00:16:54.306 --> 00:16:55.166]  This is a big winner.
[00:16:57.853 --> 00:16:58.874]  It's finally here.
[00:16:58.874 --> 00:17:03.717]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[00:17:03.717 --> 00:17:10.341]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[00:17:10.341 --> 00:17:12.382]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[00:17:12.382 --> 00:17:21.208]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[00:17:21.468 --> 00:17:27.973]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of trunascent iodine working for my body.
[00:17:27.973 --> 00:17:29.554]  I can personally feel the difference.
[00:17:29.554 --> 00:17:37.659]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:42.503]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[00:17:42.503 --> 00:17:47.326]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of trunascent iodine today.
[00:17:47.486 --> 00:17:54.950]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[00:17:54.950 --> 00:18:00.132]  That's InfoWarsTore.com!
[00:18:00.132 --> 00:18:02.734]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:16.317 --> 00:18:19.539]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:24.243]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:18:24.243 --> 00:18:30.748]  We're gonna be hearing from Alex again here coming up in this hour.
[00:18:30.748 --> 00:18:41.356]  In the second hour, I'm going to lay out an expose, if you will, on wartime conservatism.
[00:18:43.937 --> 00:18:46.279]  And what that means and how we go about it.
[00:18:46.279 --> 00:18:51.344]  A video from me yesterday at a local precinct meeting.
[00:18:51.344 --> 00:18:54.206]  And this is catching on like wildfire today.
[00:18:54.206 --> 00:18:55.948]  I mean, I didn't even talk to any of these people.
[00:18:55.948 --> 00:19:01.012]  I don't talk to Buttsex, the former CIA guy on Fox News.
[00:19:01.012 --> 00:19:02.354]  By the way, I like Buck Sexton.
[00:19:02.354 --> 00:19:08.499]  That's just a whole joke the CIA guys do with all these goofy names like Buck Sexton and Dr. Analsex.
[00:19:08.499 --> 00:19:09.060]  It's a big joke.
[00:19:10.314 --> 00:19:16.900]  But they know the general public wouldn't even believe it, so they just go ahead and do it right in front of your face.
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.241]  But he's talking about it.
[00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:22.604]  Josh Hawley gave a powerful speech on the floor today all about it.
[00:19:22.604 --> 00:19:25.066]  Again, I don't talk to the Missouri Senator.
[00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:27.348]  I didn't talk to them before I gave my speech last night.
[00:19:27.348 --> 00:19:33.233]  I didn't, you know, so it's like Republicans and conservatives are starting to get it.
[00:19:33.233 --> 00:19:34.654]  Now, the problem is within
[00:19:35.714 --> 00:19:40.538]  The Republican Party, there's a bunch of stopgap, just old heads that just don't get it yet.
[00:19:40.538 --> 00:19:41.619]  But they're in the minority.
[00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:43.982]  Now, I'll get into all of that coming up in the second hour.
[00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:44.862]  Alex Jones coming up.
[00:19:44.862 --> 00:19:48.005]  I got some news I want to get to now as well.
[00:19:48.005 --> 00:19:53.430]  But first, folks, we're still on air thanks to your support at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.073]  It's really just amazing if you think about it.
[00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:22.608]  Because I see all of this stuff happening in America, and this Great Awakening that's happening, this renaissance that the New World Order is trying to stop because it's a death blow for them, and to think that we were the first test for the total internet ban and censorship, and yet here we are still surviving it, that is such a victory.
[00:20:23.444 --> 00:20:26.985]  That is just us being on air every day is a victory.
[00:20:26.985 --> 00:20:35.907]  Even if I come on air and fumble and bumble around like an idiot, it's still a victory that we're still here, we're still broadcasting, and that they didn't win, they didn't shut us down.
[00:20:35.907 --> 00:20:49.231]  Now they're still trying, they're still throwing the knives, they're still shooting the arrows and everything, but thanks to your support at Infowarsstore.com, we're still live on air, and believe me, that is a miracle just like this country is.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:56.164]  So, total free speech platform funded by you at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:20:56.164 --> 00:20:58.366]  We got specials continuing.

[00:21:27.111 --> 00:21:34.320]  The t-shirts, the hats, the air filters, the water filters, the great supplements, it's all at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:35.558 --> 00:21:46.182]  And you know what, I want a printout of the Baby Lives Matter on my desk, because I said to myself, I wanna plug that all day, that's gonna sell like hotcakes.
[00:21:46.182 --> 00:21:51.044]  So somebody just print that out for me to remember, so that I remember to plug that all day for the rest of the day.
[00:21:51.044 --> 00:21:54.805]  Baby Lives Matter.
[00:21:54.805 --> 00:21:55.885]  Baby Lives Matter.
[00:21:55.885 --> 00:22:01.487]  We've got the t-shirt, and we've got the baby onesie.
[00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:02.848]  So take advantage of this.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.001]  And by the way, they just shut down.
[00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:08.582]  I'm going to get into this now.
[00:22:08.582 --> 00:22:10.103]  They shut down.
[00:22:10.103 --> 00:22:12.404]  You're not even allowed to do joke shirts like this.
[00:22:12.404 --> 00:22:16.447]  There was a bar that was doing a shirt that said, Drunk Wives Matter.
[00:22:16.447 --> 00:22:17.387]  It's funny.
[00:22:17.387 --> 00:22:19.048]  People bought it.
[00:22:19.048 --> 00:22:19.929]  It's called capitalism.
[00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:24.269]  Oh, the left-wing outrage mob came and shut that down.
[00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:26.331]  You can't have a Drunk Wives Matter shirt.
[00:22:26.331 --> 00:22:28.755]  That's insensitive to Black Lives Matter.
[00:22:28.755 --> 00:22:30.237]  Which is really just the Democrat Party.
[00:22:30.237 --> 00:22:30.978]  Think about that.
[00:22:30.978 --> 00:22:36.445]  The Democrat Party puts out all these front groups as like a wall, politically, around them.
[00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:46.735]  So it's like they're protected by all this front group BS like Black Lives Matter, or Occupy Wall Street, or March for Our Lives, or whatever the hell else it is.
[00:22:46.735 --> 00:22:52.779]  It's all just walls stopping you from getting to the heart of the crime, which is the Democrat Party.
[00:22:52.779 --> 00:22:54.760]  But I digress.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.484]  Infowarsstore.com, BabyLivesMatter, put that on your baby today.
[00:23:00.484 --> 00:23:04.406]  I would say, hey, tweet it at me, I'll retweet you, but I'm banned.
[00:23:04.406 --> 00:23:05.207]  But you should still do that.
[00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:08.662]  So here's the censorship we're enduring.
[00:23:08.662 --> 00:23:15.546]  Now, if you recall yesterday, I covered the study that came out that basically shows what we already know.
[00:23:15.546 --> 00:23:21.110]  Social media marketing is now basically the market economy.
[00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:26.053]  If you want to be marketing and advertising, social media is now the way to go.
[00:23:26.053 --> 00:23:30.796]  Billboards and print and radio and TV is going the way of the dodo bird.
[00:23:30.796 --> 00:23:32.077]  Everything's going digital.
[00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:34.058]  Everything's going to social media.
[00:23:34.058 --> 00:23:35.159]  And so they did a study with a
[00:23:36.147 --> 00:23:45.071]  A paper that they released, and it got, one got the social media marketing, the other didn't, and it was like 10 times the response.
[00:23:45.071 --> 00:23:46.172]  And that was just on Twitter.
[00:23:46.172 --> 00:23:48.253]  But think about Facebook, YouTube, everything.
[00:23:48.253 --> 00:23:53.375]  So, and I'll be honest folks, it does bother me.
[00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:58.858]  It makes me feel good that InfoWars is the tip of the spear, and that's why we get the most bans.
[00:23:58.858 --> 00:24:00.959]  But it also bothers me, I'm not gonna lie.
[00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:03.100]  Yeah, you know what, I got a bit of an ego, I'm selfish.
[00:24:04.324 --> 00:24:09.709]  I have these tendencies, I'm on camera all day.
[00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:15.915]  This show right now should be on YouTube with 100,000 live audience right now.
[00:24:15.915 --> 00:24:18.778]  We don't get that access.
[00:24:18.778 --> 00:24:27.446]  All the research, all the effort, all the great crew, everything you've done, all of it, all of us together, we should be number one!
[00:24:27.446 --> 00:24:28.087]  And we would be!
[00:24:29.417 --> 00:24:35.599]  We would be number one today, we would be number one tomorrow, we would be number one yesterday.
[00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:40.340]  We don't get that access, because we love America, we love God, we're real.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.340]  So it does bother me.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.221]  Yeah, I'll be honest, that pisses me off.
[00:24:45.221 --> 00:24:55.504]  But, I also know that's the biggest victory of all, being the number one enemy in media of the anti-American New World Order.
[00:24:55.504 --> 00:24:56.124]  But here you go,
[00:24:57.455 --> 00:25:01.761]  So now NBC is working with a bunch of leftist cults.
[00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.372]  In censorship that all have ties to Black Lives Matter or foreign funding.
[00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:09.032]  Literally, it's been traced back.
[00:25:09.032 --> 00:25:23.417]  And so this NBC reporter says, thanks to the SF Fake News and CCD Hate for their hard work and collaboration in getting Zero Hedge and the Federalists blocked by AdSense and Google Ads.
[00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:24.457]  That should be a lawsuit.
[00:25:24.457 --> 00:25:27.138]  That will cost them a lot of money.
[00:25:27.138 --> 00:25:28.158]  I don't know their numbers.
[00:25:28.158 --> 00:25:29.959]  I know it cost us millions when they did it.
[00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:33.342]  Most people couldn't survive that.
[00:25:33.342 --> 00:25:35.842]  We did it thanks to you.
[00:25:35.842 --> 00:25:43.845]  But actually, the reporter from NBC who put this out deleted her original tweet, which also had the hashtag Black Lives Matter.
[00:25:43.845 --> 00:25:50.387]  And again, you can go follow the digital footprint, breadcrumbs of these people.
[00:25:50.387 --> 00:25:53.568]  It's all Black Lives Matter, Democrat-funded, foreign-funded grouping.
[00:25:54.557 --> 00:25:57.059]  Censoring your free speech.
[00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:59.280]  Censoring the free speech of Americans.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.741]  Infowars.com headline.
[00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:07.145]  NBC News reporter thanks foreign groups for collaboration in pushing Google to defund the Federalist.
[00:26:07.145 --> 00:26:08.946]  And Zero Hedge.
[00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:09.626]  National file.
[00:26:09.626 --> 00:26:13.949]  Digital hate watchdog that got Zero Hedge banned from AdSense releases website blacklist.
[00:26:13.949 --> 00:26:15.890]  They're coming for you next, folks.
[00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.573]  And again, it's all the same people that fund the Democrat Party and all these other groups, with Soros and the rest of them.
[00:26:22.048 --> 00:26:26.090]  Infowars.com headline, petition launched to uncover the Winston Churchill statue.
[00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.571]  You know, this image is the left in a nutshell.
[00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:33.973]  If they don't like something, they just cover it up and pretend it's not there.
[00:26:33.973 --> 00:26:36.394]  And then they just tell you you're racist or a bigot.
[00:26:37.378 --> 00:26:40.239]  If you think that it shouldn't be covered.
[00:26:40.239 --> 00:26:42.719]  But what are they really trying to cover up, folks?
[00:26:42.719 --> 00:26:45.840]  Bill Gates' involvement with coronavirus and the vaccines.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.881]  They claim, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:49.801]  Don't talk about that, we'll censor you.
[00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:53.002]  Don't talk about Warren Buffett's brick company.
[00:26:53.002 --> 00:26:54.443]  But there's a twist to that.
[00:26:54.443 --> 00:26:56.003]  It wasn't his, but the bricks were real!
[00:27:02.222 --> 00:27:10.440]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the...
[00:27:12.176 --> 00:27:14.018]  Race riot hoax of 2020.
[00:27:14.018 --> 00:27:17.381]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[00:27:17.381 --> 00:27:23.646]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[00:27:23.646 --> 00:27:29.471]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[00:27:29.471 --> 00:27:31.933]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[00:27:31.933 --> 00:27:32.774]  That's why now
[00:27:33.394 --> 00:27:43.384]  More than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[00:27:43.384 --> 00:27:47.547]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[00:27:47.547 --> 00:27:51.811]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:54.174]  InfoWars.com LIVE!
[00:27:55.819 --> 00:28:03.327]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[00:28:03.327 --> 00:28:09.513]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[00:28:09.513 --> 00:28:10.975]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[00:28:11.055 --> 00:28:11.555]  I don't know.
[00:28:27.648 --> 00:28:32.589]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years.
[00:28:32.589 --> 00:28:34.470]  And the doctors, they tried every test.
[00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.970]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.952]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[00:28:39.952 --> 00:28:42.132]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[00:28:42.132 --> 00:28:45.153]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it.
[00:28:45.153 --> 00:28:47.014]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[00:28:47.014 --> 00:28:47.574]  I got it.
[00:28:47.574 --> 00:28:48.794]  I hid it from the nurses.
[00:28:48.794 --> 00:28:49.834]  I started taking it.
[00:28:49.834 --> 00:28:51.875]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[00:28:51.875 --> 00:28:52.815]  It saved my life.
[00:28:52.815 --> 00:28:55.536]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:58.095]  It's finally here.

[00:29:59.803 --> 00:30:02.424]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:17.473]  You found it.
[00:30:17.473 --> 00:30:19.494]  The tip of the spear.
[00:30:19.494 --> 00:30:26.098]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:30:26.098 --> 00:30:29.480]  Folks, we have a golden opportunity right now in America.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.102]  And I'm gonna explain this coming up in the next hour.
[00:30:33.102 --> 00:30:43.849]  But... We can't really... We don't really get this feedback since the censorship against us.
[00:30:43.849 --> 00:30:44.029]  But...
[00:30:46.354 --> 00:31:00.608]  The soil is ripe for patriotism, for red-pilling, for America First, for Infowars, whatever you want to say, the soil is ripe.
[00:31:00.608 --> 00:31:10.217]  And I really am excited to talk about this in the second hour and then get your response to this, but I'm telling you folks, what used to be considered fringe or conspiracy
[00:31:11.454 --> 00:31:18.515]  Or far-right wingers or whatever you want to call it is now mainstream conservative politics.
[00:31:18.515 --> 00:31:24.997]  We just haven't realized it yet because no leaders have really pushed the gas on this.
[00:31:24.997 --> 00:31:28.518]  Even Trump has kind of let off the gas on this a little bit.
[00:31:28.518 --> 00:31:34.099]  But the engine is full and primed and the track is hot.
[00:31:36.442 --> 00:31:39.244]  But I'll get into that coming up in the next hour.
[00:31:39.244 --> 00:31:43.826]  I want to finish because I was cut short a little bit by the break.
[00:31:43.826 --> 00:31:46.848]  Tying this back into the censorship.
[00:31:46.848 --> 00:31:49.529]  So they don't want you talking about Bill Gates.
[00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:52.011]  They don't want the hashtag expose Bill Gates and they got...
[00:31:53.150 --> 00:32:04.818]  All the things saying, oh Bill Gates isn't involved with coronavirus, oh Bill Gates isn't involved with the shutdown, oh Bill Gates isn't involved with vaccines or microchipping, and you're sitting here like, wait a second, I know he's involved with all of that.
[00:32:04.818 --> 00:32:10.522]  Yes, but see, Bill Gates owns all of this media.
[00:32:10.522 --> 00:32:16.946]  And so, they cover for him.
[00:32:16.946 --> 00:32:20.209]  And, it shouldn't matter, though.
[00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:21.990]  Whether you think Bill Gates is bad or not,
[00:32:23.277 --> 00:32:35.846]  You have the right to free speech, and you have the right to talk about what Bill Gates is up to without being censored or de-platformed or demonetized or shut down or slandered or libeled.
[00:32:35.846 --> 00:32:37.407]  But they don't let you do that.
[00:32:37.407 --> 00:32:41.770]  But see, here's what they really do.
[00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:44.632]  Because this is the real Schadenfreude right here.
[00:32:44.632 --> 00:32:50.617]  But when they run an operation like this, you know you're on to something big.
[00:32:50.617 --> 00:32:52.198]  I can give you a couple examples, but
[00:32:54.332 --> 00:32:57.213]  I think the audience that's been around will know.
[00:32:57.213 --> 00:32:58.673]  But here's the latest.
[00:32:58.673 --> 00:33:03.475]  How Warren Buffett's brick company got caught up in a conspiracy theory about U.S.
[00:33:03.475 --> 00:33:05.256]  protests.
[00:33:05.256 --> 00:33:07.256]  Well, that's not really accurate.
[00:33:07.256 --> 00:33:08.077]  So what's the story?
[00:33:08.077 --> 00:33:23.762]  Well, if you remember, during the first wave of the George Floyd riots, in about five or six cities, you had pallets of bricks just placed in the middle of the riot areas magically, right?
[00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:26.477]  How'd they get there?
[00:33:26.477 --> 00:33:27.378]  Who'd they come from?
[00:33:27.378 --> 00:33:28.739]  Well, nobody really seems to know.
[00:33:28.739 --> 00:33:38.790]  I guess we don't get an investigation, we don't get to use the surveillance grid for that, but they were there and they were used as part of the riots.
[00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:46.258]  So Warren Buffett has a brick company that he's invested in, and a picture goes around of a pallet of Warren Buffett bricks with the logo, and then
[00:33:47.481 --> 00:33:48.662]  Maybe some people talk about that.
[00:33:48.662 --> 00:33:54.147]  I mean I'm entrenched and ingrained in the media as much as anybody else and I never even saw this.
[00:33:54.147 --> 00:33:59.351]  So this really shows you that they probably false flagged this entire thing.
[00:33:59.351 --> 00:34:08.539]  Somebody put this up of the Warren Buffett brick company and then made some false claim like these are the bricks used so they could come and run this in the round.
[00:34:09.824 --> 00:34:17.290]  Pretending like the whole conspiracy that there were bricks laid out for the rioters during the Floyd riots, during the Democrat riots.
[00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.851]  Oh, that was just a conspiracy.
[00:34:18.851 --> 00:34:20.592]  See, we traced it back.
[00:34:20.592 --> 00:34:24.595]  They were just trying to blame Warren Buffett and say that this was... These bricks weren't even there.
[00:34:24.595 --> 00:34:27.898]  In fact, the cops even investigated these bricks and it was part of a housing site.
[00:34:27.898 --> 00:34:31.621]  Of course, that's not even the story.
[00:34:31.621 --> 00:34:33.862]  Nobody was talking about those bricks.
[00:34:33.862 --> 00:34:35.223]  Nobody ever saw those bricks.
[00:34:35.223 --> 00:34:37.525]  Those bricks were never on the streets.
[00:34:37.525 --> 00:34:37.925]  But you see,
[00:34:39.624 --> 00:34:52.592]  Oh, somebody did place the bricks on the streets, and it obviously goes up way, way high, so they had to run an operation, a false flag, making you think, oh, this was the bricks they were talking about.
[00:34:52.592 --> 00:34:54.253]  Oh, they were blaming Warren Buffett?
[00:34:54.253 --> 00:34:58.255]  Even though none of that ever happened, it was all their own head fake.
[00:34:58.255 --> 00:35:01.497]  It was all their own play action.
[00:35:01.497 --> 00:35:03.719]  This is what they do.
[00:35:03.719 --> 00:35:05.480]  This is what they've done on other such things.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.640]  Pizzagate is one example.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.601]  I'll stop right there.
[00:35:11.755 --> 00:35:22.264]  So I'm just telling you folks, the levels of deception that we're dealing with right now are unparalleled.
[00:35:22.264 --> 00:35:23.786]  Unparalleled.
[00:35:23.786 --> 00:35:25.407]  And so it's pretty extreme.
[00:35:25.407 --> 00:35:28.230]  See now, that's the real stuff right there.
[00:35:32.435 --> 00:35:46.964]  But you see, then they roll these other things like, oh, well, the government put these out for barricades, oh, these were put out here for projects, but of course those were never the subject of the discussion of the bricks that were placed out during these riots.
[00:35:46.964 --> 00:35:48.785]  It's all a big head fake, folks.
[00:35:48.785 --> 00:35:59.612]  It's all a big, oh, see, plant your own evidence, plant your own fake evidence, and then run your own investigation of the fake evidence, and then claim you've discovered the whole truth even though the whole thing was staged.
[00:36:00.802 --> 00:36:07.103]  This is what they do.
[00:36:07.103 --> 00:36:30.147]  And I understand why it's so hard for people to believe this, but I think because of the fake Russian collusion and the fake Ukrainian quid pro quo and the fake Jussie Smollett hate crime and the Stormy Daniels and everything else and the fake pandemic and everything, people are starting to get it.
[00:36:32.045 --> 00:36:34.407]  More than ever.
[00:36:34.407 --> 00:36:47.377]  And so, when they're gonna bring back now, and they will, they're getting ready for the second wave of coronavirus, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:47.377 --> 00:36:49.799]  Get ready.
[00:36:49.799 --> 00:36:53.602]  Some of the headlines, by the way, most is being pushed by Drudge.
[00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:57.706]  I'm pretty sure almost all conservatives and Trump supporters who want
[00:36:59.358 --> 00:37:03.542]  Mainline Drudge had that as their landing page.
[00:37:03.542 --> 00:37:05.244]  I'm pretty sure everyone's abandoned Drudge.
[00:37:05.244 --> 00:37:13.512]  So I don't know what happened to Matt Drudge or what happened to the Drudge Report, but it's definitely not what it once was.
[00:37:13.512 --> 00:37:15.494]  And everybody seems to notice that.
[00:37:15.494 --> 00:37:18.898]  So most of this propaganda is actually coming from Drudge.
[00:37:18.898 --> 00:37:22.221]  Like the red headline, I wouldn't go to a Trump rally, Dr. Fauci.
[00:37:24.653 --> 00:37:28.054]  Health workers feel the toll of the virus fight.
[00:37:28.054 --> 00:37:32.036]  Oh, and it's all about how tough it is for the health workers out of the AP.
[00:37:32.036 --> 00:37:36.318]  How about the police officers that are getting MURDERED?
[00:37:36.318 --> 00:37:40.260]  How about the old people that got murdered by Democratic governors?
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:40.880]  We'll get more to that.
[00:37:42.406 --> 00:37:46.107]  Rush to disinfect offices has some environmental health experts worried.
[00:37:46.107 --> 00:37:51.809]  I can't remember when I was talking about this, if it was the Alex Jones Show or the War Room that I normally host, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:37:51.809 --> 00:37:53.469]  at Banned.video.
[00:37:53.469 --> 00:38:00.051]  All the spraying, all the chemicals, all these things are so bad for our environment.
[00:38:00.051 --> 00:38:01.852]  They're so bad for you in general!
[00:38:01.852 --> 00:38:03.633]  Yeah, they kill viruses.
[00:38:03.633 --> 00:38:03.953]  Guess what?
[00:38:03.953 --> 00:38:04.773]  They're killing you too!
[00:38:06.698 --> 00:38:08.819]  But see, we don't think about that.
[00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:13.662]  It's all about, oh, we've been put into a panic and fear by the media, so we've got to do something.
[00:38:13.662 --> 00:38:16.083]  Hypersanitize everything!
[00:38:16.083 --> 00:38:21.506]  Make our environment totally foreign, poisonous chemicals!
[00:38:21.506 --> 00:38:24.788]  And also give up our freedom and privacy!
[00:38:24.788 --> 00:38:26.308]  Well, it's not going too well.
[00:38:26.308 --> 00:38:30.611]  71% of Americans reject privacy-killing, contact-tracing apps.
[00:38:30.611 --> 00:38:31.791]  They're already out there, folks.
[00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:34.393]  You're already being contact-traced, you just don't know it yet.
[00:38:35.196 --> 00:38:37.659]  But it's the same thing.
[00:38:37.659 --> 00:38:39.140]  Oh, we've got a global pandemic.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.642]  We care about you.
[00:38:40.642 --> 00:38:41.583]  We love you.
[00:38:41.583 --> 00:38:43.284]  We're going to spy on you in real time.
[00:38:43.284 --> 00:38:44.286]  For your safety!
[00:38:44.286 --> 00:38:48.610]  Oh, we love you.
[00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.973]  We love you so much, you little American.
[00:38:50.973 --> 00:38:51.473]  Yes.
[00:38:51.473 --> 00:38:56.458]  We're going to spray you with a bunch of poisonous chemicals to keep you clean during a virus.
[00:38:56.458 --> 00:38:57.019]  Yes.
[00:38:57.019 --> 00:38:57.800]  Ooh.
[00:39:00.466 --> 00:39:04.207]  Did I mention we're going to run fake studies about hydroxychloroquine?
[00:39:04.207 --> 00:39:11.849]  Because we know that actually works as a preventative, but we don't want you to be healthy because we're sick psychopathic freaks.
[00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:14.330]  And Bill Gates is going to give us a lot of money.
[00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:18.691]  He's going to make billions off of this vaccine and the contact tracing.
[00:39:18.691 --> 00:39:21.492]  He said he'd share it with me.
[00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:24.473]  Oh, wait.
[00:39:24.473 --> 00:39:28.554]  I had a grandma in a nursing home that they sent COVID into and now she's dead.
[00:39:30.247 --> 00:39:31.448]  But you know what?
[00:39:31.448 --> 00:39:35.451]  I don't care that the Democrats murdered my grandma, because it's worth it to kill America.
[00:39:35.451 --> 00:39:45.258]  Because America's racist and bad and bigoted and not a good country at all, even though everybody and their mom wants to try to come here because it's the best country in the history of the world.
[00:39:45.258 --> 00:39:46.519]  I just, I think it's okay.
[00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:50.662]  So I'm okay with the Democrats killing my grandma in the nursing home to end America.
[00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:51.903]  I think that's good.
[00:39:51.903 --> 00:39:54.165]  And we should censor anybody that disagrees.
[00:39:55.325 --> 00:39:59.367]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[00:39:59.367 --> 00:40:00.947]  The first of its kind.
[00:40:00.947 --> 00:40:05.909]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[00:40:05.909 --> 00:40:08.930]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:12.012]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[00:40:12.012 --> 00:40:15.113]  The great part about the X2 spray is it's great on the go.
[00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:17.674]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[00:40:18.174 --> 00:40:20.696]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[00:40:20.696 --> 00:40:22.397]  It's great to keep with you.
[00:40:22.397 --> 00:40:28.701]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[00:40:28.701 --> 00:40:30.222]  We're really excited about it.
[00:40:30.222 --> 00:40:32.364]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[00:40:32.364 --> 00:40:43.872]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[00:40:44.332 --> 00:40:54.723]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.121]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, Great Suppliers.
[00:40:58.121 --> 00:41:03.562]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food, it's the highest quality, they've got it.
[00:41:03.562 --> 00:41:09.964]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[00:41:09.964 --> 00:41:12.485]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[00:41:12.485 --> 00:41:15.826]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[00:41:15.826 --> 00:41:24.008]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless, and we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[00:41:25.231 --> 00:41:28.013]  We are going to still go down the hard road now.
[00:41:28.013 --> 00:41:33.918]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[00:41:33.918 --> 00:41:35.439]  You need to get high quality storable food.
[00:41:35.439 --> 00:41:36.620]  It's something you need.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:47.648]  We have high quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast and 360Win, so please take care of your storable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.

[00:43:59.306 --> 00:44:01.967]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:11.425 --> 00:44:17.675]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:44:22.093 --> 00:44:29.735]  I am just as frustrated with President Trump as most of you.
[00:44:29.735 --> 00:44:35.997]  But I understand that he is trying to restore the republic and turn our economy back on and secure our borders.
[00:44:35.997 --> 00:44:40.699]  He has legitimately fought very, very hard and gotten hundreds of critical things done.
[00:44:40.699 --> 00:44:48.842]  Yes, he's failed massively when it comes to reining in big techs, censorship, surveillance, abuse, and bullying of the American people.
[00:44:49.685 --> 00:44:49.745]  And
[00:45:06.351 --> 00:45:13.633]  What should we do to support the president and to kick him into high gear, get him outside of his bubble to take action?
[00:45:13.633 --> 00:45:16.513]  And what should those bold actions be?
[00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:18.174]  Owen Schroeder is hosting the broadcast today.
[00:45:18.174 --> 00:45:24.115]  I think it's a question he should pose to the audience and take phone calls and ask that question.
[00:45:24.115 --> 00:45:29.557]  But I know this, it's up to we the people to start taking action as well.
[00:45:29.557 --> 00:45:34.858]  So again, instead of getting mad at President Trump, let's look in the mirror and ask, how are we going to give him a good kick in the butt?
[00:45:35.626 --> 00:45:39.448]  And how are we going to give ourselves a good kick in the ass to take action?
[00:45:39.448 --> 00:45:53.897]  All I know is our country is completely overrun by globalist and globalist sympathizers who cannot wait to put this country into a permanent massive depression and then use the economic degradation for social control over us all.
[00:45:53.897 --> 00:45:56.679]  What they can do now with big tech surveillance and manipulation
[00:45:57.728 --> 00:46:01.834]  To monitor us and enforce compliance is something the planet's never seen before.
[00:46:01.834 --> 00:46:04.899]  Now here's some good news and some bad news on that front.
[00:46:05.862 --> 00:46:08.904]  Story up on Infowars.com by Steve Watson.
[00:46:08.904 --> 00:46:13.046]  71% of Americans reject privacy-killing contact tracing apps.
[00:46:13.046 --> 00:46:16.848]  Europeans also say no to government monitoring.
[00:46:16.848 --> 00:46:18.929]  In fact, Europe has similar numbers.
[00:46:18.929 --> 00:46:24.932]  Almost three-quarters of Americans say they will not submit their privacy to contact tracing apps.
[00:46:24.932 --> 00:46:32.936]  The European Union also rejects the notion outright because they do not trust government to keep their information safe and refrain from misusing it.
[00:46:32.936 --> 00:46:33.316]  A study
[00:46:34.249 --> 00:46:42.039]  A major study reveals that the vast majority of Americans are against contact tracing apps with 71% saying they will not download them and 75%...
[00:46:43.686 --> 00:46:46.989]  Believing their digital privacy is at risk from the technology.
[00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:48.029]  But here's the problem.
[00:46:48.029 --> 00:47:03.801]  Four months ago, Apple and Google merged their database and their tracking system on their operating systems and are coordinating with Communist China, the EU, the UN, and others to track where you are in lifetime regardless that's been given to quote law enforcement.
[00:47:03.801 --> 00:47:07.143]  So this is the police state that I vehemently oppose.
[00:47:07.884 --> 00:47:15.694]  And that's another example, a window into understanding what a real police state is versus, quote, abolishing the police.
[00:47:15.694 --> 00:47:22.742]  A police state is where you're surveilled and where you're controlled and where if you don't comply with the system, you get arrested, you get in prison.
[00:47:22.742 --> 00:47:23.824]  That's the old sense of it.
[00:47:24.833 --> 00:47:32.555]  And where there's basically a police officer and a spy and a snitch on every corner, and your neighbors and your children are routing you out for cash payments.
[00:47:32.555 --> 00:47:37.816]  That's what the Democrats have been erecting in their blue cities, their blue states, the Republicans to a certain extent.
[00:47:37.816 --> 00:47:50.558]  But under the COVID hoax, we have seen a real rejection by Republicans in a populist movement across party lines, saying no to the surveillance, no to the mask, no to the contact tracing.
[00:47:50.558 --> 00:47:52.559]  You've seen Democrats embrace it as a tool
[00:47:53.686 --> 00:47:54.106]  Of course.
[00:48:27.077 --> 00:48:27.237]  I'm
[00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.274]  And the corporate bureaucracy, we're going to quote, defeat America.
[00:48:50.274 --> 00:48:51.975]  We're going to defeat the Brexit.
[00:48:51.975 --> 00:48:53.797]  We're going to defeat Bolsonaro.
[00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:59.404]  We're going to defeat your worldwide movement of liberty and that China will be the model.
[00:48:59.404 --> 00:49:03.728]  This is what the globalists and the controllers and the elites and the academics all talk about.
[00:49:03.728 --> 00:49:05.390]  This is what's in the CFR publications.
[00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:08.053]  This is just the reality of like sitting down.
[00:49:08.974 --> 00:49:10.976]  At a restaurant, they bring you a menu.
[00:49:10.976 --> 00:49:12.557]  This is what's going on.
[00:49:12.557 --> 00:49:19.442]  And until the general public understands this worldview and understands how existential this threat is to all of us, we don't have a hope.
[00:49:19.442 --> 00:49:21.404]  But getting back briefly, the police state.
[00:49:21.404 --> 00:49:29.049]  The police state is an authoritarian, unconstitutional, oppressive mode of authoritarian governance.
[00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.832]  That's what the New World Order, the Democrats, the blue states are.
[00:49:32.832 --> 00:49:36.193]  The Republicans have their problems and have embraced a lot of tyranny as well.
[00:49:36.193 --> 00:49:38.735]  But now they're realizing what's happening and pulling away.
[00:49:38.735 --> 00:49:40.436]  And now here's the heart of it.
[00:49:40.436 --> 00:49:52.122]  I saw police being trained 25, 26, 27 years ago to be like the feds were at Waco and just come in and slaughter Americans and confiscate guns and burn up men, women and children.
[00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:57.085]  And so I was against that because the feds getting their curriculum
[00:49:58.405 --> 00:49:58.685]  We're good.
[00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:20.033]  If somebody says get people out of the UN and has a bumper sticker, go ahead and arrest them.
[00:50:20.033 --> 00:50:22.655]  I mean, you're talking about Soviet Union type stuff.
[00:50:22.655 --> 00:50:24.997]  But the American people spoke out.
[00:50:24.997 --> 00:50:31.403]  We saw local newscasts where they have armored vehicles and the police say, we need this to take on constitutional terrorists.
[00:50:31.403 --> 00:50:33.484]  And that woke up the American people.
[00:50:33.484 --> 00:50:36.187]  And the American people went and talked to local police departments.
[00:50:36.187 --> 00:50:37.568]  They went and talked to their sheriff's departments.
[00:50:37.568 --> 00:50:40.391]  And now the majority of police in America
[00:50:41.474 --> 00:50:47.485]  We now know we're quietly rejecting this propaganda and rejecting this brainwashing.
[00:50:48.573 --> 00:50:50.054]  Right as we were warning about it.
[00:50:50.054 --> 00:50:52.595]  But they really didn't wake up to it because we warned them.
[00:50:52.595 --> 00:50:54.797]  That was only part of it, a small part of it quite frankly.
[00:50:54.797 --> 00:51:01.060]  We now know behind the scenes the police were actually really waking up and doing their own research because they saw the attempt to take them over.
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:10.506]  So now, as I've said the last 10 years, the police have become one of our biggest allies in understanding this because they see the attempted overthrow of legitimate U.S.
[00:51:10.506 --> 00:51:15.128]  government from the federal right down to the state level, but particularly at the county sheriff.
[00:51:15.128 --> 00:51:17.610]  And so as I saw them becoming really
[00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:18.890]  I think?
[00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:41.062]  So it's an official plan.
[00:51:41.062 --> 00:51:44.065]  And that's why it's important good police officers not resign.
[00:51:44.065 --> 00:51:47.247]  That's why it's important that citizens support good policing.
[00:51:47.247 --> 00:51:55.213]  And that's why we do reform, particularly the blue states and blue cities that have the worst training that President Trump is now speaking out against.
[00:51:55.213 --> 00:51:56.994]  So we're Americans.
[00:51:56.994 --> 00:51:59.336]  We've all got issues and none of us are perfect.
[00:51:59.336 --> 00:52:00.997]  But the globalists are collectively
[00:52:02.369 --> 00:52:06.391]  Coming after our local government, our system, our Constitution, our Bill of Rights.
[00:52:06.391 --> 00:52:10.873]  We need to protect it from out of control government, if it's our government or it's the United Nations.
[00:52:10.873 --> 00:52:13.675]  But particularly a foreign outside government.
[00:52:13.675 --> 00:52:21.138]  And Americans have to recognize this across political, racial, and religious lines and come together and not be fools.
[00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:21.419]  Because...
[00:52:22.435 --> 00:52:24.737]  The average leftist is too far gone.
[00:52:24.737 --> 00:52:29.500]  But many people on the left really believe what they're doing.
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.161]  Classical liberals.
[00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:35.584]  And if you just educate them, they will wake up and see what's happening.
[00:52:35.584 --> 00:52:41.608]  By simply pointing out that Communist China is the operating system of the big tech surveillance of all of it.
[00:52:42.637 --> 00:52:47.659]  And that communist China is the blueprint of what's now happening here today and what's being financed.
[00:52:47.659 --> 00:52:58.924]  And we should reject it and embrace America and fix America ourselves and not be manipulated by this constellation of evil that the globalist system constitutes.
[00:52:58.924 --> 00:53:00.964]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:53:00.964 --> 00:53:04.486]  Now back to the live transmission with Owen Schroyer and our number two.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.742]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:53:11.742 --> 00:53:12.522]  You think, just let me think.
[00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:18.286]  I suspect even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:53:18.286 --> 00:53:19.627]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:53:19.627 --> 00:53:20.307]  Damn it!
[00:53:20.307 --> 00:53:21.388]  Why?
[00:53:21.388 --> 00:53:27.972]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:53:27.972 --> 00:53:31.114]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:53:33.533 --> 00:53:38.757]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:53:38.757 --> 00:53:39.798]  You designed it, sir.
[00:53:39.798 --> 00:53:40.739]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:53:40.739 --> 00:53:42.380]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.482]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:53:44.482 --> 00:53:46.284]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:53:46.284 --> 00:53:55.932]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subjecting your submission.
[00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:56.112]  Cameras.
[00:53:56.112 --> 00:53:57.133]  We need cameras.
[00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:58.594]  How did this happen?
[00:53:58.594 --> 00:53:59.335]  Who's to blame?
[00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:02.975]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:54:02.975 --> 00:54:04.876]  They will be held accountable.
[00:54:04.876 --> 00:54:10.761]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:54:11.972 --> 00:54:13.953]  I know why you did it.
[00:54:13.953 --> 00:54:15.053]  I know you were afraid.
[00:54:15.053 --> 00:54:16.693]  Who would you be?
[00:54:16.693 --> 00:54:17.453]  War?
[00:54:17.453 --> 00:54:18.094]  Terror?
[00:54:18.094 --> 00:54:19.394]  Disease?
[00:54:19.394 --> 00:54:25.815]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:54:25.815 --> 00:54:32.217]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:54:32.217 --> 00:54:38.438]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:54:45.692 --> 00:54:46.693]  It's finally here.
[00:54:46.693 --> 00:54:51.558]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[00:54:51.558 --> 00:54:58.164]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[00:54:58.164 --> 00:55:00.226]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[00:55:00.226 --> 00:55:09.035]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[00:55:09.295 --> 00:55:15.797]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of trunascent iodine working for my body.
[00:55:15.797 --> 00:55:17.377]  I can personally feel the difference.
[00:55:17.377 --> 00:55:25.499]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[00:55:25.499 --> 00:55:30.321]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[00:55:30.321 --> 00:55:35.142]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of trunascent iodine today.
[00:55:35.322 --> 00:55:42.785]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[00:55:42.785 --> 00:55:47.147]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:55:47.147 --> 00:55:56.190]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chi-coms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[00:55:56.190 --> 00:56:00.172]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[00:56:00.848 --> 00:56:07.375]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[00:56:07.375 --> 00:56:13.361]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[00:56:13.361 --> 00:56:21.810]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:24.532]  They've admitted all of this.
[00:56:24.532 --> 00:56:32.154]  So remember, how does Infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen?
[00:56:32.154 --> 00:56:36.356]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[00:56:36.356 --> 00:56:37.556]  And yes, it's dystopic.
[00:56:37.556 --> 00:56:38.816]  And yes, it's scary.
[00:56:38.816 --> 00:56:43.038]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[00:56:43.038 --> 00:56:49.320]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.981]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:00.199 --> 00:57:04.563]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:57:04.563 --> 00:57:09.188]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:57:09.188 --> 00:57:12.111]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:37.005]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got more from Alex Jones coming up.
[00:57:37.005 --> 00:57:52.859]  And I'm going to be smattering in, to the best of my ability, what conservative or wartime conservatism means and how this needs to be the new face, the new agenda, the new strategy of the Republican Party.
[00:57:53.979 --> 00:58:02.844]  And so, I'm gonna be getting into that this hour, taking your phone calls in the third hour, and we'll be hearing from Alex throughout this as well.
[00:58:02.844 --> 00:58:23.295]  But so, yesterday I got involved at a local level in a Travis Precinct Committee meeting, and I took the message to this meeting, which is now resonating on mainstream news channels, and through Buck Sexton and through Josh Howley, we'll be hearing from them as well, because they were saying this,
[00:58:23.655 --> 00:58:24.336]  I don't talk to them.
[00:58:24.336 --> 00:58:37.367]  So I took this message to a local Republican meeting last night, not even realizing it was going to go total mainstream today with Howley and Sexton, but here it was myself last night at a local precinct meeting.
[00:58:37.367 --> 00:58:41.450]  I'm a talk show host, syndicated, radio, television.
[00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:42.471]  I'm also an activist.
[00:58:42.471 --> 00:58:43.792]  I've actually been put in D.C.
[00:58:43.792 --> 00:58:47.015]  prison twice for my support of Donald Trump on the Hill.
[00:58:49.144 --> 00:58:49.504]  Thank you.
[00:58:49.504 --> 00:58:49.824]  Thank you.
[00:58:49.824 --> 00:58:55.386]  I want to thank Richard and Don for getting me out here and Matt and Andy and others as well.
[00:58:55.386 --> 00:59:02.488]  And the reason why I'm here today is because if you're like me, you believe that we're in a fight for our country right now.
[00:59:02.488 --> 00:59:04.368]  And this is not a joke to me.
[00:59:04.368 --> 00:59:05.849]  And I don't think it's a joke to you guys either.
[00:59:06.914 --> 00:59:13.217]  I'll gladly offer my platform to Don and Mackenzie, Jennifer, we haven't met, but you as well to help get you guys in office.
[00:59:13.217 --> 00:59:20.501]  But I just want to ask you guys a couple of questions as a pretense to how I think this party needs to move going forward.
[00:59:20.501 --> 00:59:21.742]  Okay.
[00:59:21.742 --> 00:59:24.663]  Does anybody out there believe that Donald Trump colluded with Russia?
[00:59:24.663 --> 00:59:27.104]  No.
[00:59:27.104 --> 00:59:29.766]  Does anybody out there believe Donald Trump is a racist?
[00:59:31.257 --> 00:59:35.782]  Does anybody think Donald Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine?
[00:59:35.782 --> 00:59:39.807]  Does anyone think Jussie Smollett was a victim of a hate crime?
[00:59:39.807 --> 00:59:41.989]  No, no.
[00:59:41.989 --> 00:59:48.517]  These are all games that the Democrats and the media play to stymie America and stymie Donald Trump.
[00:59:49.423 --> 00:59:52.747]  And they're doing it again right now with coronavirus.
[00:59:52.747 --> 01:00:04.560]  And I think that this Republican party needs to be the Republican party of the future, which is the Trump Republican party, which doesn't sit here and say, Oh, how can I have a convention with your rules?
[01:00:05.467 --> 01:00:10.554]  No, this Republican Party says we make the rules.
[01:00:10.554 --> 01:00:13.618]  We ripped the rules 300 years ago.
[01:00:13.618 --> 01:00:15.080]  We have a Bill of Rights.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:23.310]  And if this Republican Party is talking about who's essential and who can go to school or a park or go to business, well then what party is going to protect our rights?
[01:00:24.031 --> 01:00:27.013]  Because it's definitely not going to be the Democrat Party.
[01:00:27.013 --> 01:00:38.180]  So I think that this Republican Party moving forward needs to be battle hardened to protect America and to stand up for Donald Trump and not play games with the Democrats anymore.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.221]  These are obstacles they put in front of us.
[01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:46.305]  It's time to smash through these obstacles and for this Republican Party to be fearless in 2020.
[01:00:46.305 --> 01:00:46.766]  Fearless.
[01:00:46.766 --> 01:00:47.466]  God bless you guys.
[01:00:47.466 --> 01:00:47.846]  Seriously.
[01:00:47.846 --> 01:00:48.847]  Thank you guys for letting me talk.
[01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:57.873]  So there was a little bit before that, a little bit after that, just kind of chopping it up with some of the attendees.
[01:00:57.873 --> 01:01:02.876]  But folks, a message like that four years ago started to resonate widely.
[01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:06.878]  Ten years ago, probably would have been booted right out of Republican Party politics.
[01:01:06.878 --> 01:01:14.341]  Today, right now where we stand, that message is the message.
[01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:18.423]  That message resonates with almost 100% of Republican Party voters.
[01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:34.893]  And so it's time for Republicans to stop cowering to the media, stop playing games with the Democrats, stop being afraid of their own shadow, stop being afraid of their own thoughts, and it's time to be the wartime conservative party.
[01:01:34.893 --> 01:01:36.695]  The wartime Republican Party.
[01:01:36.695 --> 01:01:40.960]  Because we are in a war for this country right now, and we have enemies domestic.
[01:01:43.769 --> 01:01:48.511]  Terror groups all being run by the Democrat Party who want to destroy America.
[01:01:48.511 --> 01:01:50.371]  That message is not so crazy anymore.
[01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:52.232]  That's mainstream messaging right there.
[01:01:52.232 --> 01:01:55.213]  It's time for Republicans to catch up.
[01:01:55.213 --> 01:02:08.397]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the
[01:02:10.111 --> 01:02:11.952]  Race riot hoax of 2020.
[01:02:11.952 --> 01:02:15.315]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:21.579]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[01:02:21.579 --> 01:02:27.403]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[01:02:27.403 --> 01:02:29.865]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[01:02:29.865 --> 01:02:30.706]  That's why now
[01:02:31.326 --> 01:02:41.314]  More than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[01:02:41.314 --> 01:02:45.477]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[01:02:45.477 --> 01:02:49.740]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.723]  InfoWars.com lives!
[01:03:06.551 --> 01:03:16.858]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:03:16.858 --> 01:03:24.803]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[01:03:24.803 --> 01:03:31.848]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:03:35.682 --> 01:03:51.551]  We have to make sure that as we listen to the community, as we work with council to build out this department, and as we continue to work under DOJ reform, we've got to make sure that we are trying to do something meaningfully different than what we have been doing before.
[01:03:51.551 --> 01:04:02.237]  And we have learned by testing out these different areas that this is really the culmination of work for a concept that is the first of its kind in Albuquerque, and we believe actually nationwide.
[01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.298]  And fundamentally, what it says is this.
[01:04:05.298 --> 01:04:13.042]  For a hundred years, when you call 9-1-1, all across America, the response is fire or police or both.
[01:04:13.042 --> 01:04:24.708]  And we're adding a third response into that equation by developing a civilian, professionally trained approach, a public health approach, really, to public safety.
[01:04:24.708 --> 01:04:29.410]  And that is embodied in our development of a department, the Community Safety Department.
[01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:38.835]  That's what we're announcing here today, that our administration is going to pursue the idea of creating this third department in our first responder system.
[01:04:38.835 --> 01:04:47.780]  Now through this department, we're creating a new model for community safety that sends the right resource at the right time on the right call.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.743]  And that's where our current two departments have always struggled.
[01:04:51.743 --> 01:04:58.808]  You have to send an overly trained person from one or the other to deal with situations we should really have others responding to.
[01:04:58.808 --> 01:05:10.996]  So this is about having a trained but unarmed professional responding to calls for mental health, for addiction, for inebriation, for homelessness, for down and outs, and even simple things like abandoned cars.
[01:05:10.996 --> 01:05:14.859]  We spend an inordinate amount of time sending officers out to check on abandoned cars.
[01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:22.746]  It also means simple things engaging the community like around traffic management and how we can do that again with an unarmed professional.
[01:05:23.698 --> 01:05:29.261]  So inherent in this restructuring is also the question of what our city needs.
[01:05:29.261 --> 01:05:35.945]  And it's the rejection of a false choice between investing in community and in a capable police department.
[01:05:35.945 --> 01:05:42.408]  We know that in Albuquerque, we have to respect the needed core police work that we need in our town.
[01:05:42.408 --> 01:05:47.931]  But we also have to include the fact that we've got to prioritize non-law enforcement alternatives.
[01:05:48.351 --> 01:05:51.212]  More than 10 years ago, President Obama spilt the beans.
[01:05:51.212 --> 01:05:56.093]  He told the world that America was going to have a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as the U.S.
[01:05:56.093 --> 01:05:56.293]  military.
[01:06:14.195 --> 01:06:15.196]  And who is that army?
[01:06:15.196 --> 01:06:27.986]  Well, we've got training videos from Chicago, from New York, from Houston, of the Obama Youth Brigades and the Obama Corps actually training.
[01:06:27.986 --> 01:06:30.408]  And what was the training?
[01:06:30.408 --> 01:06:37.334]  Training people for socialism, training people for communism, training people for gun confiscation.
[01:06:37.334 --> 01:06:41.998]  Training people that after society collapses because of clout and pivot bankruptcy strategies,
[01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:51.292]  That then an army of social workers would then come out and reorganize the American people.
[01:06:51.292 --> 01:07:06.505]  And that's in the United Nations Strong Cities Initiative documents that Loretta Lynch put into function in 2015, a year and a half before Obama left office, in over 800 cities and towns in the United States.
[01:07:06.505 --> 01:07:11.208]  A direct liaison with the United Nations telling local governments
[01:07:12.352 --> 01:07:15.333]  How to operate and what policies to have.
[01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:21.494]  And now I have a stack of articles that are just out today.
[01:07:21.494 --> 01:07:23.314]  Here's one from Gateway Pundit.
[01:07:23.314 --> 01:07:24.094]  Here we go.
[01:07:24.094 --> 01:07:31.876]  Albuquerque to start sending unarmed social workers on some 9-1-1 city calls.
[01:07:31.876 --> 01:07:35.256]  Albuquerque is going to start sending unarmed social workers.
[01:07:35.256 --> 01:07:39.697]  Mayor Tim Keller announced the quote civilian public safety branch.
[01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:43.286]  You talk about secret police, folks.
[01:07:43.286 --> 01:07:44.247]  This is the liberals.
[01:07:44.247 --> 01:07:45.048]  This is the left.
[01:07:45.048 --> 01:07:50.213]  This is the woke folks that have been created on the university campuses that are full of tyranny.
[01:07:50.213 --> 01:07:51.214]  This is Chas.
[01:07:51.214 --> 01:07:55.097]  This is Chop expanding and coming to your town.
[01:07:55.097 --> 01:07:59.321]  You can see the press conference again on Infowars.com or GatewayPundit.com.
[01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:01.043]  I'm sure I'll be playing a clip of this coming up.
[01:08:01.923 --> 01:08:03.604]  Where he announces it.
[01:08:03.604 --> 01:08:07.146]  This is extremely serious.
[01:08:07.146 --> 01:08:08.726]  Society is breaking down.
[01:08:08.726 --> 01:08:13.129]  Every time the police make a mistake or something goes wrong, they're going to be demonized.
[01:08:13.129 --> 01:08:14.850]  It's going to be magnified.
[01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.290]  And then more U.N.
[01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:24.394]  control, more communist control, more Saul Alinsky community organizing will be brought in until the police department is totally remade in their image.
[01:08:24.394 --> 01:08:31.198]  Now, once the left takes control of a department like in Chicago, it won't matter if there's 20 deaths a day, as there are some days.
[01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:32.458]  Black on black.
[01:08:32.458 --> 01:08:33.779]  They'll just sweep that under the rug.
[01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:35.120]  The media won't cover it.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.661]  It won't exist.
[01:08:36.661 --> 01:08:43.886]  But every time an officer who's white or black does something to a black person, it's going to be caught on tape.
[01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:44.646]  It's going to be released.
[01:08:44.646 --> 01:08:46.147]  It's going to be blown up.
[01:08:46.147 --> 01:08:47.688]  And it's going to be the end of the world.
[01:08:47.688 --> 01:08:48.869]  It's the same thing with mass shootings.
[01:08:48.869 --> 01:08:50.470]  They're still very, very extremely rare.
[01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:53.011]  It's one of the rarest ways to die in the United States.
[01:08:53.011 --> 01:08:54.452]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:08:54.452 --> 01:08:56.394]  Every time there's a mass shooting, it's blown up.
[01:08:56.394 --> 01:08:57.254]  It's made to be huge.
[01:08:57.254 --> 01:08:59.596]  And every gun owner is to blame.
[01:09:00.496 --> 01:09:04.198]  Every time a white cop kills a black person, every white person is to blame.
[01:09:04.198 --> 01:09:10.040]  This is the war on logic from the same people that tell you there aren't two genders.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:19.384]  From the same people that tell you no borders, no walls, no USA at all, but they want borders and walls around their leftist systems at universities and places like CHAZ and CHOP.
[01:09:19.384 --> 01:09:22.765]  These people tell you to do one thing, but they do the opposite.
[01:09:22.765 --> 01:09:26.667]  It's classic 1984 George Orwell or Animal Farm.
[01:09:27.367 --> 01:09:30.470]  So again, this is the reality of where we are.
[01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:33.612]  It's what we face as a society, a United Nations takeover.
[01:09:33.612 --> 01:09:35.334]  It's not coming, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:35.334 --> 01:09:36.115]  It's here.
[01:09:36.115 --> 01:09:47.444]  And it's a leftist, touchy-feely bureaucracy, but behind it is cold, hardcore New World Order enslavement, corporate planetary fascism over communism for we the people.
[01:09:47.444 --> 01:09:48.245]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:09:48.245 --> 01:09:51.228]  The only way this video and information gets out is if you share it.
[01:09:51.228 --> 01:09:54.911]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:09:57.725 --> 01:10:17.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, if the left and Democrats and their pandering and virtue signaling and social justice warrioring had any truth to it, I think we know where they would be saying black lives matter.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.741]  But they're not.
[01:10:18.741 --> 01:10:21.162]  So it took one individual with the courage
[01:10:22.045 --> 01:10:32.511]  To say the truth, to a group of hospital workers taking a knee for BLM, one black man decided to see if they really care about black lives.
[01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:34.472]  Here's how it went.
[01:10:34.472 --> 01:10:38.434]  Black lives killed by black men matter, right?
[01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:38.655]  Yes?
[01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:40.055]  Hold on guys, let's start this over.
[01:10:40.055 --> 01:10:41.937]  The black babies killed in the abortion clinic... Hold on, hold on, stop it.
[01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:43.758]  Start it over so at the beginning we can hear him cheering.
[01:10:43.758 --> 01:10:47.420]  Black lives matter or just some black lives?
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.820]  All black lives matter!
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:51.222]  The black lives killed by black men matter, right?
[01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:54.510]  Yes?
[01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:58.411]  The black babies killed in the abortion clinics matter, right?
[01:10:58.411 --> 01:10:59.572]  Thought so.
[01:10:59.572 --> 01:11:05.593]  The black officers killed by that bastard in Minnesota, that matters too, right?
[01:11:05.593 --> 01:11:06.273]  Okay.
[01:11:06.273 --> 01:11:10.314]  But the black babies that are killed in the abortion clinics don't matter, do they?
[01:11:10.314 --> 01:11:12.375]  Medical people.
[01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:14.675]  Do their lives matter?
[01:11:14.675 --> 01:11:16.736]  Does the future of our black babies matter?
[01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:19.571]  Um, what's up?
[01:11:19.571 --> 01:11:20.031]  What's up?
[01:11:20.031 --> 01:11:22.212]  Awful quiet now, aren't they?
[01:11:22.212 --> 01:11:23.393]  Uh-huh.
[01:11:23.393 --> 01:11:27.275]  It's okay if we kill them in the womb, right?
[01:11:27.275 --> 01:11:32.558]  But you have a problem when we, you don't seem to really have a problem when we kill them on the streets.
[01:11:32.558 --> 01:11:34.900]  Yes, well we know they're the same issue.
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:44.065]  If we don't, if we don't respect the lives of our unborn children enough to save them and fight for them, our lives mean nothing once we're born.
[01:11:45.336 --> 01:12:00.640]  Well, we at InfoWars completely agree, and that's why we have decided to launch the Baby Lives Matter onesie and Baby Lives Matter t-shirt at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.920]  And why is this so important?
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.061]  Why is this message so important?
[01:12:04.061 --> 01:12:09.142]  Well, not only do you support the broadcast when you purchase the Baby Lives Matter onesie or t-shirt,
[01:12:09.682 --> 01:12:26.340]  You also fight back against the false narrative or false pandering that the left does when they say Black Lives Matter, but they ignore all the black-on-black violence, they ignore the black police officers that get murdered, and more importantly, they ignore the tens of millions of black babies that get aborted.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:30.104]  But that's why the Baby Lives Matter t-shirt is such art.
[01:12:31.027 --> 01:12:41.357]  And such a perfect message for this time because are you gonna have people telling you that black lives matter but then ignore Planned Parenthood murdering tens of millions of black babies?
[01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:51.906]  But just in general, the fact that we abort our own children and then pretend to care about life anytime it works as a pandering to the Democrat Party virtue signal.
[01:12:51.906 --> 01:12:54.549]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism.
[01:12:55.149 --> 01:13:00.213]  And so, populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[01:13:00.213 --> 01:13:11.122]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[01:13:11.903 --> 01:13:20.347]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[01:13:20.347 --> 01:13:26.950]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, openly saying, defund the police.
[01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:28.271]  The police have a lot of problems.
[01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:29.631]  We all have a lot of problems.
[01:13:29.631 --> 01:13:32.393]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[01:13:32.393 --> 01:13:34.474]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[01:13:35.319 --> 01:13:39.345]  They are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process for freedom.
[01:13:39.345 --> 01:13:43.130]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:45.293]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[01:13:45.293 --> 01:13:49.760]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.801]  InfoWars.com
[01:13:52.307 --> 01:13:53.968]  It's finally here.

[01:14:54.954 --> 01:14:57.595]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:09.703 --> 01:15:17.944]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:15:23.088 --> 01:15:28.713]  Last night the city of Beverly Hills took hypocrisy to a new level.
[01:15:28.713 --> 01:15:42.804]  That's right, the Hollywood elite enclave that's been virtually signaling on Twitter and releasing YouTube videos calling for uprisings and occupying different parts of the United States passed a unanimous resolution barring
[01:15:43.524 --> 01:15:54.078]  protests in the Beverly Hills area in any group of more than 10 people at one time and banning individuals from protesting overnight.
[01:15:54.078 --> 01:15:55.459]  That's a form of curfew.
[01:15:55.459 --> 01:15:57.962]  It's a form of martial law.
[01:15:57.962 --> 01:16:00.966]  This is the very group that has been lockstep
[01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:08.276]  Raising more than $30 million, the Democratic Party, using George Floyd's name.
[01:16:08.276 --> 01:16:12.581]  And now, of course, there's a whole new controversy about the fact that that money is going to the Democrats.
[01:16:12.581 --> 01:16:13.983]  There is no shame.
[01:16:13.983 --> 01:16:16.005]  There is no bottom to these people.
[01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:19.490]  They only want to take control of the government.
[01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:23.976]  So they can continue to exploit the United States to build their new world order.
[01:16:23.976 --> 01:16:35.553]  And the fact that they are now trying to, quote, abolish the police all over the United States and the Democratic Party is officially signing on to begin the, quote, abolishment of the police.
[01:16:36.394 --> 01:16:47.497]  Shows you that they're really just trying to take control of the police and that they're the ones that use the police to say that they need to beat people up and arrest them that don't stay six feet apart or wear the mask.
[01:16:47.497 --> 01:16:48.998]  It's a cult.
[01:16:48.998 --> 01:16:50.378]  And there's more hypocrisy, of course.
[01:16:50.378 --> 01:16:55.100]  100,000 people in New York for Black Lives Matter, the Democratic Party's new political system.
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:17:02.202]  If you criticize them, well, most people are getting fired from radio shows, TV shows, you name it, for even saying all lives matter.
[01:17:02.802 --> 01:17:04.923]  This is complete cult programming.
[01:17:04.923 --> 01:17:08.486]  But then when Trump tries to have a rally, oh, you can't do that.
[01:17:08.486 --> 01:17:10.207]  You're going to get people killed.
[01:17:10.207 --> 01:17:15.110]  This is a suspension of logic, and it's a cult that will do whatever they're told.
[01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:17.372]  The followers don't care if they're hypocrites.
[01:17:17.372 --> 01:17:19.413]  They don't care if the Democrats want more wars.
[01:17:19.413 --> 01:17:21.935]  They don't care if Trump's trying to turn the economy back on.
[01:17:21.935 --> 01:17:24.216]  They don't care if big tech's running death camps in China.
[01:17:24.216 --> 01:17:25.637]  They don't care if they're being surveilled.
[01:17:25.637 --> 01:17:26.618]  They don't care if they're schmucks.
[01:17:26.618 --> 01:17:27.559]  They don't care if they're losers.
[01:17:27.559 --> 01:17:30.020]  They don't care if they're not even part of the power structure.
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.242]  They just like to feel good and hate on America.
[01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:33.102]  I think?
[01:17:51.621 --> 01:17:59.527]  The average leftist is a degenerate, physically ugly person that stinks and has never had a real job in their life.
[01:17:59.527 --> 01:18:03.811]  And they believe that if they can just pull us down, somehow that will make them higher.
[01:18:03.811 --> 01:18:04.732]  That's what we're facing.
[01:18:04.732 --> 01:18:06.033]  That's what we're dealing with.
[01:18:06.033 --> 01:18:08.855]  Back to the live transmission with Owen Schroer.
[01:18:08.855 --> 01:18:10.516]  I'm Alex Jones on the road.
[01:18:10.516 --> 01:18:15.260]  Remember, the only way to defeat the enemy and their censorship is for you to spread the live links.
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:17.362]  This is an information war.
[01:18:17.362 --> 01:18:19.684]  Win by taking action.
[01:18:19.684 --> 01:18:21.185]  Lose by not taking it seriously.
[01:18:22.568 --> 01:18:32.653]  You know, I don't know if the leftists can understand this analogy, but this is a warning.
[01:18:32.653 --> 01:18:47.860]  I genuinely ache when I see my fellow man being deceived and brainwashed and tortured and drawn to Satanism.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:48.600]  But imagine
[01:18:50.916 --> 01:19:00.278]  What is the toughest thing about cancer that makes it so hard to cure or to beat?
[01:19:00.278 --> 01:19:04.359]  Well, it's how do you isolate the cancer cells?
[01:19:04.359 --> 01:19:05.520]  How do you isolate them?
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:11.381]  How do you draw them out so that you can just go after them and not after the good cells and then just kill the entire body?
[01:19:11.381 --> 01:19:12.381]  How do you isolate that?
[01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:14.102]  How do you draw those cancer cells out?
[01:19:15.998 --> 01:19:24.420]  I'm not a doctor dealing with cancer here today, but imagine that the left in America is a cancer, which it is.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:27.161]  Which it is.
[01:19:27.161 --> 01:19:35.784]  And so the left in America is cancer to freedom and justice and everything that is righteous and good.
[01:19:35.784 --> 01:19:38.124]  So how would you isolate that cancer?
[01:19:38.124 --> 01:19:43.546]  How would you draw that cancer out if you wanted to, say, deal with it?
[01:19:45.885 --> 01:19:54.031]  Well, again, I hope that the average leftist understands this analogy.
[01:19:54.031 --> 01:19:56.533]  You are the cancer.
[01:19:56.533 --> 01:20:00.876]  You are being drawn out.
[01:20:00.876 --> 01:20:02.618]  Everyone knows you're the cancer.
[01:20:02.618 --> 01:20:05.079]  Everyone sees that you're the cancer.
[01:20:05.079 --> 01:20:06.140]  You've now been isolated.
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.701]  You now have ID'd yourself.
[01:20:07.701 --> 01:20:10.904]  You've now made it possible to be eliminated.
[01:20:16.161 --> 01:20:27.970]  So, the difference is, if you're the blood cell, you can make the conscious decision not to be cancer.
[01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:43.402]  But the longer this goes on, the more you commit to being a cancer on society, the more you isolate and ID yourself, the higher the odds are that you're going to get what it is
[01:20:45.233 --> 01:20:52.335]  You're asking for.
[01:20:52.335 --> 01:21:06.579]  And if you're just out there thinking, hey, I'm gonna have a good time and I'm gonna loot and riot and, you know, the establishment's corrupt anyway, well, you've been fooled because you're doing exactly what the establishment wants you to do.
[01:21:06.579 --> 01:21:12.300]  Now, this is breaking news right here, and I'm gonna get into wartime conservatism coming up on the other side.
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.701]  This is breaking news right here.
[01:21:14.813 --> 01:21:15.514]  Out of Florida.
[01:21:15.514 --> 01:21:24.341]  17 arrested for child pornography include Disney employees, nurse, underwear, and jester.
[01:21:24.341 --> 01:21:29.646]  Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, that's the same guy who said if a criminal comes in your house to blow them back.
[01:21:32.168 --> 01:21:48.784]  Sheriff Grady Judd detailed the arrests and charges of 17 suspects, including Disney and hospital employees, accused of downloading or distributing child pornography featuring children as young as a few months old.
[01:21:48.784 --> 01:21:57.252]  Deputies say the child pornography included thousands of photos and videos depicting babies, toddlers, and children being forced to engage in sex acts.
[01:22:02.694 --> 01:22:05.015]  Breaks my heart.
[01:22:05.015 --> 01:22:07.176]  Toddlers?
[01:22:07.176 --> 01:22:09.878]  Toddlers?
[01:22:09.878 --> 01:22:16.581]  How in the hell does that happen?
[01:22:16.581 --> 01:22:23.525]  So now you've had mass pedophile rings rounded up in Florida and California and other states.
[01:22:23.525 --> 01:22:24.826]  Barely gets any news coverage.
[01:22:28.114 --> 01:22:30.595]  And by the way, most of these are white men.
[01:22:30.595 --> 01:22:35.276]  So, you know, for the hate white men media, why aren't they all over this story?
[01:22:35.276 --> 01:22:36.376]  Are they covering something up?
[01:22:36.376 --> 01:22:45.419]  I wonder how many people on mainstream news maybe watch some of this stuff.
[01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:47.379]  These are sick people we're talking about on TV.
[01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:50.240]  Would you really be that surprised?
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.680]  Why else wouldn't they be covering this?
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:53.561]  They hate white men.
[01:22:53.561 --> 01:22:54.401]  Most of these are white men.
[01:22:58.646 --> 01:23:04.551]  They never covered the other mass roundup of pedophiles that had kids in cages.
[01:23:04.551 --> 01:23:07.074]  They never covered the one in California.
[01:23:07.074 --> 01:23:07.934]  They never covered any of it.
[01:23:07.934 --> 01:23:15.041]  They never covered the sex drug dungeon of Ed Buck.
[01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:16.222]  Do you think you're going to see this anywhere?
[01:23:18.001 --> 01:23:21.802]  If you're going to see this story right here anywhere on TV, you'll see it on Tucker Carlson.
[01:23:21.802 --> 01:23:22.342]  That's it.
[01:23:22.342 --> 01:23:23.822]  But you probably won't.
[01:23:23.822 --> 01:23:29.904]  Not even that Tucker's not covering it, or not trying to cover it, but he just probably won't be able to fit it into his one hour.
[01:23:29.904 --> 01:23:34.265]  But this is about the scum of the earth right here.
[01:23:34.265 --> 01:23:36.525]  It's about as bad as it gets right here.
[01:23:36.525 --> 01:23:39.226]  Doesn't get any lower than this.
[01:23:39.226 --> 01:23:43.887]  Children being raped and tortured for the viewing pleasure of others, and it's not
[01:23:45.051 --> 01:23:46.672]  Top news today, it's not on TV.

[01:24:50.023 --> 01:24:53.267]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[01:24:54.028 --> 01:24:55.608]  The first of its kind.
[01:24:55.608 --> 01:25:00.570]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:03.591]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[01:25:03.591 --> 01:25:06.671]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[01:25:06.671 --> 01:25:09.752]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[01:25:09.752 --> 01:25:12.273]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:15.055]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.

[01:25:17.057 --> 01:25:23.322]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.

[01:25:27.046 --> 01:25:38.536]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[01:25:38.996 --> 01:25:51.158]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at InfowarsStore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself.
[01:25:51.158 --> 01:25:52.939]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:53.419]  You're on the air.
[01:25:53.419 --> 01:25:53.959]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:53.959 --> 01:25:54.279]  Yeah, hello.
[01:25:54.279 --> 01:25:55.019]  Can you hear me?
[01:25:55.019 --> 01:25:55.659]  I sure can, sir.
[01:25:55.659 --> 01:25:56.099]  Thank you.
[01:25:56.099 --> 01:25:56.559]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:56.559 --> 01:26:02.940]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.301]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[01:26:04.301 --> 01:26:06.301]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and
[01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.422]  I just want to plug in.
[01:26:08.422 --> 01:26:12.845]  I'm a truck driver and 2x4s have changed the way I drive.
[01:26:12.845 --> 01:26:19.489]  Me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[01:26:19.489 --> 01:26:24.032]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that.
[01:26:24.032 --> 01:26:27.534]  I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[01:26:27.594 --> 01:26:33.879]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[01:26:33.879 --> 01:26:36.180]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.642]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[01:26:38.642 --> 01:26:41.324]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[01:26:41.324 --> 01:26:45.347]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[01:26:45.347 --> 01:26:47.149]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.889]  So that means a lot to me.
[01:26:47.889 --> 01:26:49.230]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:52.533]  We love you.
[01:26:52.533 --> 01:26:55.155]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:07.748 --> 01:27:11.009]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:27:11.009 --> 01:27:17.491]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:27:17.491 --> 01:27:25.494]  For the next two segments, I am going to explain to you the concept, the name, dubbed by Buck Sexton.
[01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:33.092]  Former CIA now does coverage for Fox News and his own Buck Sexton show.
[01:27:33.092 --> 01:27:40.155]  No, not Dr. Anal Sex, the anti-American CIA that they're posing as Floyd's former teacher.
[01:27:40.155 --> 01:27:48.338]  This is the good Buck Sexton, who is calling it out for what it really is, and he has an excellent piece right now at BuckSexton.com.
[01:27:48.338 --> 01:27:51.099]  It's time to rally around the concept of wartime conservatism.
[01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:54.760]  This is going mainstream, this is gaining momentum, and
[01:27:56.223 --> 01:27:58.546]  I'll get into the ins and outs of the story in a little bit.
[01:27:58.546 --> 01:28:01.529]  But first, folks, I didn't know he was going to write this story.
[01:28:01.529 --> 01:28:03.912]  I didn't know Josh Hawley was going to give this speech today.
[01:28:03.912 --> 01:28:07.577]  But I'm telling you, Republicans and conservatives are getting it now.
[01:28:07.577 --> 01:28:15.286]  And so here's me talking at a local Republican precinct committee meeting last night, and then Josh Hawley on Capitol Hill this morning.
[01:28:16.798 --> 01:28:20.899]  I'm a talk show host, syndicated, radio, television.
[01:28:20.899 --> 01:28:21.919]  I'm also an activist.
[01:28:21.919 --> 01:28:28.601]  I've actually been put in DC prison twice for my support of Donald Trump on the Hill.
[01:28:28.601 --> 01:28:28.961]  Thank you.
[01:28:28.961 --> 01:28:29.281]  Thank you.
[01:28:29.281 --> 01:28:34.843]  I want to thank Richard and Don for getting me out here and Matt and Andy and others as well.
[01:28:34.843 --> 01:28:41.945]  And the reason why I'm here today is because if you're like me, you believe that we're in a fight for our country right now.
[01:28:41.945 --> 01:28:43.826]  And this is not a joke to me.
[01:28:43.826 --> 01:28:45.306]  And I don't think it's a joke to you guys either.
[01:28:46.351 --> 01:28:52.673]  I'll gladly offer my platform to Don and Mackenzie, Jennifer, we haven't met, but you as well to help get you guys in office.
[01:28:52.673 --> 01:28:59.935]  But I just want to ask you guys a couple of questions as a pretense to how I think this party needs to move going forward.
[01:28:59.935 --> 01:29:01.195]  Okay.
[01:29:01.195 --> 01:29:04.096]  Does anybody out there believe that Donald Trump colluded with Russia?
[01:29:04.096 --> 01:29:06.556]  No.
[01:29:06.556 --> 01:29:09.197]  Does anybody out there believe Donald Trump is a racist?
[01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:15.236]  Does anybody think Donald Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine?
[01:29:15.236 --> 01:29:19.261]  Does anyone think Jussie Smollett was a victim of a hate crime?
[01:29:19.261 --> 01:29:21.443]  No, no.
[01:29:21.443 --> 01:29:27.991]  These are all games that the Democrats and the media play to stymie America and stymie Donald Trump.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.203]  And they're doing it again right now with coronavirus.
[01:29:32.203 --> 01:29:44.015]  And I think that this Republican party needs to be the Republican party of the future, which is the Trump Republican party, which doesn't sit here and say, Oh, how can I have a convention with your rules?
[01:29:44.918 --> 01:29:50.021]  No, this Republican Party says we make the rules.
[01:29:50.021 --> 01:29:53.083]  We ripped the rules 300 years ago.
[01:29:53.083 --> 01:29:54.544]  We have a bill of rights.
[01:29:54.544 --> 01:30:02.750]  And if this Republican Party is talking about who's essential and who can go to school or a park or go to business, well then what party is going to protect our rights?
[01:30:03.490 --> 01:30:06.472]  Because it's definitely not going to be the Democrat party.
[01:30:06.472 --> 01:30:17.618]  So I think that this Republican party moving forward needs to be battle hardened to protect America and to stand up for Donald Trump and not play games with the Democrats anymore.
[01:30:17.618 --> 01:30:19.659]  These are obstacles they put in front of us.
[01:30:19.659 --> 01:30:25.762]  It's time to smash through these obstacles and for this Republican party to be fearless in 2020.
[01:30:25.762 --> 01:30:26.223]  Fearless.
[01:30:26.223 --> 01:30:26.923]  God bless you guys.
[01:30:26.923 --> 01:30:27.303]  Seriously.
[01:30:27.303 --> 01:30:28.284]  Thank you guys for letting me talk.
[01:30:34.002 --> 01:30:47.112]  If this case makes anything clear, it is that the bargain that has been offered to religious conservatives for years now is a bad one.
[01:30:47.112 --> 01:30:48.974]  It's time to reject it.
[01:30:48.974 --> 01:30:55.439]  The bargain has never been necessarily explicitly articulated, but religious conservatives know what it is.
[01:30:56.476 --> 01:31:14.282]  The bargain is that you go along with the party establishment, you support their policies and priorities, or at least keep your mouth shut about it, and in return the establishment will put some judges on the bench who supposedly will protect your constitutional rights to freedom of worship, to freedom of exercise.
[01:31:14.282 --> 01:31:17.803]  That's been what we were told for years now.
[01:31:19.434 --> 01:31:35.064]  And we were told that we're supposed to shut up while the party establishment focuses more on cutting taxes and handing out favors for corporations, multinational corporations who don't share our values, who will not stand up for American principles, who are only too happy to ship American jobs overseas.
[01:31:35.064 --> 01:31:37.486]  But we're supposed to say nothing about that.
[01:31:37.486 --> 01:31:42.910]  We're supposed to keep our mouths shut because maybe we'll get a judge out of the deal.
[01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:44.631]  That was the implicit bargain.
[01:31:44.631 --> 01:31:48.754]  We're supposed to keep our mouths shut while the party establishment opens borders
[01:31:49.734 --> 01:31:53.855]  Well, the party establishment pursues ruinous trade policies.
[01:31:53.855 --> 01:32:08.520]  We're supposed to keep our mouths shut while those at the upper end of the income bracket get all of the attention while working families and college students and those who don't want to go to college but can't get a good job while they get what?
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.060]  What attention?
[01:32:10.856 --> 01:32:16.277]  Workers, children, what about parents looking for help with the cost of raising children?
[01:32:16.277 --> 01:32:19.118]  Looking for help with the culture in which they have to raise children?
[01:32:19.118 --> 01:32:24.239]  Looking for help with the communities, rebuilding the communities in which they must carry out their family life?
[01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:32.620]  What about college students trying to find an education that isn't ruinously expensive and then figure out some way to pay back that ruinous debt?
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:36.361]  What about those who don't have a college degree and don't want one but like to get a good job?
[01:32:36.361 --> 01:32:36.901]  What about them?
[01:32:38.905 --> 01:32:50.976]  Now we're supposed to stay quiet about all of that, and more, because there be pro-Constitution religious liberty judges.
[01:32:50.976 --> 01:32:53.538]  Except that there aren't.
[01:32:53.538 --> 01:32:57.161]  Except for that these judges don't follow the Constitution.
[01:32:57.161 --> 01:33:03.527]  Except for these judges invoke textualism and originalism in order to reach their preferred outcome.
[01:33:03.527 --> 01:33:05.548]  Now I want to be clear, I did not
[01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:31.051]  Personally criticizing any justice who joined the majority opinion or wrote it, I believe 100% that the justices, the justice who principally authored this opinion, Justice Gorsuch, and those who joined him are sincere and who were writing to the best of their ability, reasoning to the best of their ability, and the opinion is, it is, whatever else you might say about it, it is not sloppily reasoned.
[01:33:32.196 --> 01:33:37.778]  No, I think that they were doing what they thought was best and using all of the skills and gifts that they had.
[01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:40.619]  No, I question how we got here.
[01:33:40.619 --> 01:33:46.421]  I question how judges who hold to this philosophy ended up on that bench.
[01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:54.584]  I question the bargain that people of faith have been offered and asked to hold to for all of these years.
[01:33:55.549 --> 01:34:02.078]  And the truth is, to those who have said, who have objected to my own questioning of judicial nominees in this body,
[01:34:03.015 --> 01:34:29.322]  To those who said I was wrong to question judges who came before the Judiciary Committee, to those who chided me for asking tough questions, even of nominees by a Republican president, for those who said that I was slowing the process down and I was out of line, for the supposedly conservative groups who threatened to buy television time in my own state to punish me for asking questions about conservative judges, I just have this to say.
[01:34:29.322 --> 01:34:30.643]  This is why I ask questions.
[01:34:31.721 --> 01:34:33.641]  This is why I won't stop.
[01:34:33.641 --> 01:34:38.602]  And I wish some more people would ask some harder questions.
[01:34:38.602 --> 01:34:42.123]  Because this outcome is not acceptable.
[01:34:42.123 --> 01:34:48.644]  And the bargain which religious conservatives have been offered is not tenable.
[01:34:48.644 --> 01:34:53.045]  So I would just say, it's not time for religious conservatives to shut up.
[01:34:53.045 --> 01:34:54.705]  We've done that for too long.
[01:34:54.705 --> 01:34:58.126]  No, it's time for religious conservatives to stand up and to speak out.
[01:34:59.164 --> 01:35:05.309]  It's time for religious conservatives to bring forward the best of our ideas on every policy affecting this nation.
[01:35:05.309 --> 01:35:07.591]  We should be out in the forefront leading.
[01:35:07.591 --> 01:35:08.772]  On economics.
[01:35:08.772 --> 01:35:10.113]  On trade.
[01:35:10.113 --> 01:35:11.134]  On race.
[01:35:11.134 --> 01:35:12.255]  On class.
[01:35:12.255 --> 01:35:17.019]  On every subject that matters for what our founders called the general welfare.
[01:35:17.019 --> 01:35:18.440]  Because we have a lot to offer.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.624]  Not just to protect our own rights, but for the good of all of our fellow citizens.
[01:35:22.624 --> 01:35:24.345]  Because as religious believers we know
[01:35:25.509 --> 01:35:36.298]  That serving our fellow citizens, of whatever their religious faith, whatever their commitments may be, serving them, aiding them, working for them, is one of the signature ways that we show a love of neighbor.
[01:35:36.298 --> 01:35:38.100]  It's time for religious conservatives to do that.
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:43.584]  It's time for religious conservatives to take the lead, rather than being pushed to the back.
[01:35:43.584 --> 01:35:51.011]  It's time for religious conservatives to stand up and speak out, rather than being told to sit down and shut up.
[01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:52.172]  And because I am confident,
[01:35:53.271 --> 01:36:08.917]  The people of faith, of goodwill, all across this country, are ready to do that, and want to do that, and have something to offer this country, and every person in this country, whatever their background, or income, or race, or religion, because of that, I'm confident in the future.
[01:36:08.917 --> 01:36:13.859]  I'm also confident that the old ways will not do.
[01:36:13.859 --> 01:36:16.000]  So let this be a departure.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.920]  Let this be a new beginning.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.361]  Let this be the start of something better.
[01:36:20.353 --> 01:36:22.074]  Josh Hawley.
[01:36:22.074 --> 01:36:25.437]  Thank God for the senator from Missouri.
[01:36:25.437 --> 01:36:31.081]  By the way, Missouri had a Christian conservative governor, Greitens, literally got set up by the FBI.
[01:36:31.081 --> 01:36:32.742]  They forced him out of office.
[01:36:32.742 --> 01:36:35.304]  So, this is the battle, folks.
[01:36:35.304 --> 01:36:36.605]  Now I'm going to get more into this.
[01:36:36.605 --> 01:36:44.270]  Some Republicans are understanding that the new conservative platform needs to be, we're fighting a war for America right now.
[01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:46.011]  So we'll get into that on the other side.
[01:36:46.011 --> 01:36:47.132]  And I'll give out the phone number.
[01:36:47.132 --> 01:36:48.173]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:36:50.253 --> 01:36:52.876]  The United States is not Communist China.
[01:36:52.876 --> 01:36:55.799]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[01:36:55.799 --> 01:36:57.681]  We don't blow up churches.
[01:36:57.681 --> 01:37:00.865]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[01:37:00.865 --> 01:37:06.351]  But all over the news, we see the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates, WHO, mainstream corporations.
[01:37:10.169 --> 01:37:17.757]  And if Communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well then, gee, we've got to do that.
[01:37:17.757 --> 01:37:23.422]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[01:37:23.422 --> 01:37:26.605]  Well, now Cuomo in New York's calling it the European virus.
[01:37:26.605 --> 01:37:28.327]  These people are out of control.
[01:37:31.824 --> 01:37:37.046]  Because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them and their power grab.
[01:37:37.046 --> 01:37:41.127]  The resistance lives at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[01:37:41.127 --> 01:37:47.069]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[01:37:49.096 --> 01:37:50.117]  It's finally here!
[01:37:50.117 --> 01:37:54.959]  Introducing the first-of-its-kind nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[01:37:54.959 --> 01:38:01.582]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep-earth crystal nascent iodine.
[01:38:01.582 --> 01:38:03.643]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[01:38:03.643 --> 01:38:12.448]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[01:38:12.708 --> 01:38:19.234]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[01:38:19.234 --> 01:38:20.796]  I can personally feel the difference.
[01:38:20.796 --> 01:38:28.663]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:33.745]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[01:38:33.745 --> 01:38:38.746]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today.

[01:38:50.342 --> 01:38:52.762]  I was talking to my patron supplier, Great Suppliers.
[01:38:52.762 --> 01:38:55.703]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[01:38:55.703 --> 01:38:56.763]  It's the highest quality.
[01:38:56.763 --> 01:38:58.203]  They've got it.
[01:38:58.203 --> 01:39:04.604]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[01:39:04.604 --> 01:39:07.125]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[01:39:07.125 --> 01:39:10.486]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[01:39:10.486 --> 01:39:15.306]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[01:39:15.306 --> 01:39:18.647]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[01:39:19.893 --> 01:39:22.655]  We're gonna still go down the hard road now.
[01:39:22.655 --> 01:39:28.559]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still gonna be bad in my view.
[01:39:28.559 --> 01:39:30.080]  You need to get high-quality, storable food.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.261]  It's something you need.
[01:39:31.261 --> 01:39:42.289]  We have high-quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins, so please take care of your storable foods needs at InfoWareStore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[01:39:42.289 --> 01:39:45.091]  It's in great containers, high-quality, lasts 25 years.
[01:39:45.091 --> 01:39:49.094]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:39:50.865 --> 01:39:56.087]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[01:39:56.087 --> 01:40:00.368]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[01:40:00.368 --> 01:40:04.809]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[01:40:04.809 --> 01:40:13.212]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[01:40:13.212 --> 01:40:20.434]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[01:40:20.854 --> 01:40:24.477]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[01:40:24.477 --> 01:40:29.780]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:37.866]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[01:40:37.866 --> 01:40:43.229]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.
[01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:45.511]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.

[01:40:53.522 --> 01:40:56.134]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:41:13.647 --> 01:41:18.550]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:20.631]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:41:20.631 --> 01:41:24.574]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:41:24.574 --> 01:41:31.878]  Wartime conservatism is what it's being branded.
[01:41:31.878 --> 01:41:42.185]  And some Republicans are getting it, others are still afraid of their own shadow, not even realizing this is what America wants, this is what America needs.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:53.848]  And so Buck Sexton, a former CIA agent who has a Buck Sexton show and goes on Fox News regularly, wrote this piece at bucksexton.com.
[01:41:53.848 --> 01:41:59.673]  It's time to rally around the concept of wartime conservatism.
[01:41:59.673 --> 01:42:08.940]  And it really all boils down to the fact that the left is in a war to destroy America right now.
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:11.962]  And if conservatives and Republicans don't
[01:42:13.612 --> 01:42:20.996]  Take that mantle, enter that battlefield to save and protect America, then America will die.
[01:42:20.996 --> 01:42:32.282]  So, Republicans either get battle-hardened and realize the war ahead, or they will go down with the rest of this country that will be destroyed by the Democrats and the left.
[01:42:32.282 --> 01:42:37.065]  And so, you heard me saying this to local Republicans last night.
[01:42:37.065 --> 01:42:41.988]  You heard Josh Hawley saying this on the floor of the Hill today.
[01:42:43.032 --> 01:42:47.053]  Here's another example of how you do this.
[01:42:47.053 --> 01:43:02.578]  Steve Scalise demands answers from Democrat governors on forcing COVID patients into nursing homes, which resulted in 50,000 nursing home deaths.
[01:43:02.578 --> 01:43:05.599]  Steve Scalise is on the right path.
[01:43:05.599 --> 01:43:11.021]  Steve Scalise is a wartime conservative.
[01:43:11.021 --> 01:43:11.801]  Steve Scalise
[01:43:13.146 --> 01:43:16.629]  is hitting the Democrats where it hurts.
[01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:31.580]  Their agenda, which was premeditated, murdering thousands of innocent elderly people in nursing homes so that they could have their pandemic and shut down the economy and blame Donald Trump.
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:35.243]  And I remember reporting on this, I believe, before anybody else.
[01:43:35.243 --> 01:43:42.368]  These Democrats, Whitmer, Cuomo, and the rest need to be in jail for the rest of their life, maybe even face the death penalty.
[01:43:45.424 --> 01:43:49.006]  You know, you can be mad at Owen Schroyer for saying that.
[01:43:49.006 --> 01:43:50.346]  You can say, that's extreme, Owen.
[01:43:50.346 --> 01:43:50.907]  How dare you?
[01:43:50.907 --> 01:43:52.547]  This doesn't help anything.
[01:43:52.547 --> 01:43:53.048]  No, folks.
[01:43:53.048 --> 01:43:57.150]  It's the truth.
[01:43:57.150 --> 01:44:05.834]  You know, it's sad that Andrew Cuomo and Gretchen Whitmer and the rest of them made that decision.
[01:44:05.834 --> 01:44:07.695]  Laid in that bed.
[01:44:07.695 --> 01:44:09.656]  But they did it.
[01:44:09.656 --> 01:44:11.656]  They're now mass murderers.
[01:44:11.656 --> 01:44:14.178]  Serial killers.
[01:44:14.178 --> 01:44:14.698]  They chose that.
[01:44:16.633 --> 01:44:19.434]  And so they need to be treated as such.
[01:44:19.434 --> 01:44:37.182]  So, if we have a wartime Republican Party, if we have wartime conservatives, and we really understand this issue, Andrew Cuomo and Gretchen Whitmer and others will face the death penalty for what they did in these nursing homes.
[01:44:38.151 --> 01:44:40.092]  Folks, I'm not happy about that.
[01:44:40.092 --> 01:44:41.453]  That doesn't make me happy.
[01:44:41.453 --> 01:44:47.196]  That makes me tremendously upset and sad that Americans would do this.
[01:44:47.196 --> 01:44:52.179]  That our political leaders are that corrupt and that disgusting.
[01:44:52.179 --> 01:44:54.160]  But they are!
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:56.761]  And we have to start dealing with them, folks.
[01:44:56.761 --> 01:44:58.222]  Or it's only going to get worse.
[01:44:58.222 --> 01:45:01.564]  And just like Josh Hawley said, it's time for Christian conservatives
[01:45:02.772 --> 01:45:04.834]  To stand up and have their voices heard?
[01:45:04.834 --> 01:45:08.737]  Because for far too long, Christian conservatives have been told to sit down and shut up.
[01:45:08.737 --> 01:45:12.520]  No, it's time to stand up and it's time to get loud.
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.482]  And realize that we are the silent majority.
[01:45:15.482 --> 01:45:17.984]  It's time to be the loud majority.
[01:45:17.984 --> 01:45:20.566]  And it's time to make an example.
[01:45:20.566 --> 01:45:26.031]  You think you can send COVID patients into nursing homes to raise the death rate and then blame Trump?
[01:45:26.031 --> 01:45:29.113]  And fake a pandemic so you can shut down the economy and hurt America?
[01:45:29.113 --> 01:45:29.593]  You know what?
[01:45:29.593 --> 01:45:31.535]  We're gonna give you the death penalty.
[01:45:32.978 --> 01:45:35.440]  We're not going to stand for that in this country anymore.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.605]  So I'm sorry to say, Cuomo and Whitmer and the rest of them, you chose this.
[01:45:40.605 --> 01:45:42.187]  Not me.
[01:45:42.187 --> 01:45:43.188]  Not me.
[01:45:43.188 --> 01:45:44.709]  You chose this.
[01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:49.293]  Don't be mad at me for saying that you deserve the death penalty, Andrew Cuomo.
[01:45:49.293 --> 01:45:50.655]  You do!
[01:45:50.655 --> 01:45:52.657]  You chose that, Cuomo.
[01:45:52.657 --> 01:45:54.799]  Not me.
[01:45:54.799 --> 01:45:57.822]  You chose to make it legal to murder
[01:45:59.264 --> 01:46:05.187]  Babies, after they're born, you chose that Cuomo, and guess what?
[01:46:05.187 --> 01:46:07.188]  You deserve the death penalty.
[01:46:07.188 --> 01:46:09.849]  And so do the rest of the governors that did this.
[01:46:09.849 --> 01:46:13.450]  You chose that destiny.
[01:46:13.450 --> 01:46:16.792]  You chose that destiny.
[01:46:16.792 --> 01:46:22.114]  And if my destiny is to call you out for it and then watch you hang, well then you know what?
[01:46:22.114 --> 01:46:23.355]  I have no qualms with that.
[01:46:25.834 --> 01:46:27.815]  You sent those patients.
[01:46:27.815 --> 01:46:30.057]  You sent COVID into the nursing homes.
[01:46:30.057 --> 01:46:32.979]  It resulted in at least 50,000 dead.
[01:46:32.979 --> 01:46:34.520]  You did that, Cuomo.
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:35.961]  You did that, Whitmer.
[01:46:35.961 --> 01:46:37.343]  You did that, Northam.
[01:46:37.343 --> 01:46:38.483]  You did that.
[01:46:38.483 --> 01:46:41.005]  You chose to be murderers.
[01:46:41.005 --> 01:46:43.887]  You made that conscious choice, didn't you?
[01:46:43.887 --> 01:46:45.328]  And you didn't think we'd notice.
[01:46:46.329 --> 01:46:52.671]  And you know now, oh well they found out, but don't worry, Republicans and Conservatives are weak.
[01:46:52.671 --> 01:46:54.251]  They'll never stand up to us.
[01:46:54.251 --> 01:46:57.012]  We're coming for you!
[01:46:57.012 --> 01:47:09.836]  And all those innocent babies you murdered, and all those elderly people you murdered with COVID, if we don't get justice for them here on this earth, oh believe me, the justice you get after this life will be much worse.
[01:47:09.836 --> 01:47:10.056]  In fact,
[01:47:12.042 --> 01:47:16.645]  Cuomo and Whitmer and the rest of them, you better pray to God or even turn yourself in for what you did.
[01:47:16.645 --> 01:47:27.593]  Because that's the only chance you have of not receiving God's wrath for the rest of your consciousness in the afterlife.
[01:47:27.593 --> 01:47:29.334]  Good luck.
[01:47:29.334 --> 01:47:32.756]  Ted Cruz gets it though!
[01:47:32.756 --> 01:47:33.577]  Ted Cruz gets it!
[01:47:35.003 --> 01:47:41.307]  Sesame Street puts out a Gay Pride Month propaganda, because you know, it's all about sexualizing the kids.
[01:47:41.307 --> 01:47:44.950]  Because I remember growing up, you know, Sesame Street taught me how to be straight.
[01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:46.511]  Oh wait, no it didn't.
[01:47:46.511 --> 01:47:48.933]  Now Sesame Street teaches you how to be gay.
[01:47:48.933 --> 01:47:49.693]  Ted Cruz gets it.
[01:47:49.693 --> 01:47:54.917]  He replies to this tweet from Sesame Street promoting homosexuality to kids.
[01:47:54.917 --> 01:47:56.418]  He says, endless propaganda.
[01:47:56.418 --> 01:48:00.000]  This is taxpayer-funded show targeted at pre-K children.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.282]  It doesn't need to be talking about sex or sexuality at all.
[01:48:03.089 --> 01:48:06.692]  That's wartime conservatism.
[01:48:06.692 --> 01:48:12.557]  That's the new Republican Party that we need.
[01:48:12.557 --> 01:48:14.559]  This is not.
[01:48:14.559 --> 01:48:23.207]  And I'll be honest folks, I've always been a supporter of Greg Abbott and I've remained from saying anything negative about him because he's very popular here in Texas.
[01:48:23.207 --> 01:48:28.491]  I'm gonna be honest with you folks, Governor Abbott's popularity in Texas is waning.
[01:48:28.491 --> 01:48:29.032]  Big time.
[01:48:30.808 --> 01:48:31.569]  Big time.
[01:48:31.569 --> 01:48:37.014]  In fact, he may not win another election.
[01:48:37.014 --> 01:48:43.020]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott scolds 20-somethings for not wearing masks, taking coronavirus too lightly.
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:45.763]  Wrong move, Abbott.
[01:48:45.763 --> 01:48:47.344]  I've been a major supporter of yours.
[01:48:47.344 --> 01:48:49.706]  I voted for you.
[01:48:49.706 --> 01:48:52.189]  You better straighten out your
[01:48:53.962 --> 01:48:55.663]  narratives right now with coronavirus.
[01:48:55.663 --> 01:49:01.947]  You better straighten out what's going on in this state with the shutdown and you better do it quick or you will not be re-elected, Governor Abbott.
[01:49:01.947 --> 01:49:03.948]  And I'm not telling you that.
[01:49:03.948 --> 01:49:06.069]  I'm not making things up.
[01:49:06.069 --> 01:49:09.411]  I talk to local Republicans and voters.
[01:49:09.411 --> 01:49:10.472]  I'm involved in this stuff.
[01:49:10.472 --> 01:49:12.133]  They're done with you, man.
[01:49:12.133 --> 01:49:16.796]  People who would never say a negative thing about you two years ago are now done with you.
[01:49:18.226 --> 01:49:23.330]  So you better realize the wartime conservatism, wartime Republican Party is here.
[01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:26.052]  You better get on the battleship or you're going to be thrown overboard.
[01:49:26.052 --> 01:49:29.754]  We don't have time for you.
[01:49:29.754 --> 01:49:32.256]  Here's another example of wartime conservatism.
[01:49:32.256 --> 01:49:33.617]  Moms Against Floridation.
[01:49:33.617 --> 01:49:37.360]  Now this is getting no coverage at all.
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.581]  And the court case has been going on for over a week now.
[01:49:40.458 --> 01:49:47.902]  And you can tune in, but see, this will never get coverage, and quite frankly, they don't really do marketing, they don't get it anyway, but they're taking action.
[01:49:47.902 --> 01:49:55.767]  Moms Against Fluoridation, in court, right now, trying to get the poison out of our water.
[01:49:55.767 --> 01:49:57.768]  That's wartime conservatism.
[01:49:59.653 --> 01:50:02.074]  Because see, here's what the left is currently doing.
[01:50:02.074 --> 01:50:04.856]  They're in wartime kill America.
[01:50:04.856 --> 01:50:08.498]  Drunk Wives Matter t-shirt pulled at Virginia restaurant amid uproar.
[01:50:08.498 --> 01:50:09.978]  You're not allowed to have that.
[01:50:09.978 --> 01:50:12.980]  They're telling your kids how to be gay on Sesame Street.
[01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:18.763]  San Antonio Spurs head coach says American flag is irrelevant, a symbol used for political reasons.
[01:50:18.763 --> 01:50:23.945]  Never go to another NBA game again unless you want to go protest it.
[01:50:23.945 --> 01:50:28.488]  Ayanna Pressley says it's not good enough for white people not to be racist.
[01:50:30.384 --> 01:50:33.125]  Tell you, the left is in full-time war mode against America, folks.
[01:50:33.125 --> 01:50:36.026]  Time for the conservatives and Christians to respond.
[01:50:36.026 --> 01:50:44.509]  Nintendo marketing representative partnered with Switch streamer Sloan Skipper Wolf praises Shake Shack for poisoning cops.
[01:50:44.509 --> 01:50:52.271]  She still works with Nintendo and Twitch, though, even though she was glad to see cops get poisoned by Shake Shack, which they claimed after investigation.
[01:50:52.271 --> 01:50:53.632]  Oh, we didn't find anything.
[01:50:53.632 --> 01:50:59.034]  Oh, it just so happens that the three tainted shakes were the only three shakes that day and they were all served to cops.
[01:50:59.034 --> 01:50:59.794]  Ah, gotcha.
[01:51:01.738 --> 01:51:06.880]  So the left is in full-blown war mode to destroy America, folks.
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:12.602]  Mark Hamill, Luke Skywalker, is having a massive fundraiser for Joe Biden.
[01:51:12.602 --> 01:51:13.903]  And we'll see if Joe Biden shows up.
[01:51:13.903 --> 01:51:15.844]  If there's any kids there, I'd keep him away from Joe.
[01:51:15.844 --> 01:51:17.885]  He may go for a feel.
[01:51:17.885 --> 01:51:22.606]  System of a Down drummer shreds Democrats as the true fascists, the true bigots hidden in plain sight.
[01:51:22.606 --> 01:51:26.008]  Well, I'm gonna go get myself every System of a Down album that I can tonight.
[01:51:27.133 --> 01:51:30.214]  Folks, the left is in wartime mode to destroy America.
[01:51:30.214 --> 01:51:34.196]  It's time for conservatives to get in wartime mode to protect it.
[01:51:34.196 --> 01:51:36.477]  Your phone call's coming up on the other side.
[01:51:36.477 --> 01:51:40.158]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:51:40.158 --> 01:51:41.939]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[01:51:41.939 --> 01:51:42.419]  You're on the air.
[01:51:42.419 --> 01:51:42.960]  Thanks for holding.
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:43.360]  Yeah, hello?
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.020]  Can you hear me?
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:44.660]  I sure can, sir.
[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:44.981]  Thank you.
[01:51:44.981 --> 01:51:45.721]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:45.721 --> 01:51:51.963]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[01:51:51.963 --> 01:51:53.304]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[01:51:53.304 --> 01:51:55.305]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and
[01:51:55.965 --> 01:51:57.426]  I just want to plug in.
[01:51:57.426 --> 01:52:01.850]  I'm a truck driver and Turbo Force has changed the way I drive.
[01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:04.792]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[01:52:04.792 --> 01:52:08.475]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[01:52:08.475 --> 01:52:16.442]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[01:52:16.582 --> 01:52:17.343]  Thank you for that man.
[01:52:40.819 --> 01:52:42.480]  It's finally here.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:46.583]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[01:53:03.155 --> 01:53:17.703]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[01:53:17.703 --> 01:53:25.768]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism, and healthy cognitive function.

[01:53:34.057 --> 01:53:42.947]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:53:42.947 --> 01:53:45.590]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:55.419 --> 01:54:01.461]  Ladies and gentlemen the left is getting ready for their next thing to destroy America right now.
[01:54:01.461 --> 01:54:05.201]  It's the race riots But it'll probably a week or two.
[01:54:05.201 --> 01:54:15.004]  They're gonna bring back the coronavirus folks I'm already seeing signs right now with the news coming out of China, and so just just get ready
[01:54:16.041 --> 01:54:44.780]  So if that means you need to go to Infowarsstore.com and get some emergency food before the rush, or get a water filter, or, you know, whatever it is you need to do, just get ready, they're gonna come back, wave two of coronavirus, the crown virus, to crown the new world order, that's why it's called the coronavirus, it's all propaganda, it's all right in your face, the crown virus, to crown the new world order, make you a slave, in fear, the fear inoculum, and so based on what I'm seeing coming out of China with the shutdowns and everything, it's, they're getting ready to bring it back here, folks.
[01:54:46.124 --> 01:54:57.288]  So, who knows what the truth is about this, if it's deadly, if it's even real at all, but they're getting ready to shut down the economy again.
[01:54:57.288 --> 01:55:08.893]  And they're gonna blame coronavirus, or they'll make some other thing up, and then they'll tell you that you have to constantly spray poisonous chemicals on yourself to sanitize, and your surfaces to sanitize, which will give you cancer.
[01:55:10.015 --> 01:55:18.962]  And it will force you to sign on to an app that will track and trace your location 24-7, which they're already doing.
[01:55:18.962 --> 01:55:22.065]  They just needed you to sign on to it, and they needed the reasoning to do it.
[01:55:22.065 --> 01:55:24.807]  So this is all coming, folks.
[01:55:24.807 --> 01:55:26.408]  And the left is going to fully endorse all of it.
[01:55:26.408 --> 01:55:27.149]  They'll be behind it.
[01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:31.252]  So the conservatives and Republicans better start to stand up.
[01:55:35.979 --> 01:55:43.364]  And get strong, because it's not going to be pretty if we allow the left and the Democrats to get away with this, folks.
[01:55:43.364 --> 01:55:54.552]  And it's either a political revolution now, or we're going to have to fight for this country physically, probably next year, I would say, at this rate.
[01:55:54.552 --> 01:55:58.615]  Maybe even before that, depending on how bad the Democrats get between now and then.
[01:55:58.615 --> 01:56:05.460]  I want to take your phone calls here for the rest of this hour, and then we have a special report coming up with David Knight.
[01:56:08.492 --> 01:56:09.992]  877-789-2539.
[01:56:09.992 --> 01:56:15.716]  877-789-2539.
[01:56:15.716 --> 01:56:19.518]  Anything that we've covered today is fair game.
[01:56:19.518 --> 01:56:21.159]  Wartime conservatism.
[01:56:21.159 --> 01:56:27.243]  How about, I mean, again, folks, this is like crazy.
[01:56:27.243 --> 01:56:29.224]  But the stories at Infowars.com.
[01:56:29.224 --> 01:56:34.847]  German authorities placed homeless children with known pedophiles for 30 years.
[01:56:34.847 --> 01:56:35.568]  It's so corrupt.
[01:56:37.737 --> 01:56:46.504]  In Florida, 17 arrested for child pornography, including Disney employees, nurse, underwear, and jester.
[01:56:46.504 --> 01:56:53.089]  Why would the mainstream news be covering up the arrest of 17 child rapists?
[01:56:53.089 --> 01:56:55.390]  Most of them are white, by the way.
[01:56:55.390 --> 01:56:58.452]  So the hate-whitey media you think would be all over this.
[01:56:58.452 --> 01:57:04.177]  So, what does it tell you that the hate-white media
[01:57:06.249 --> 01:57:10.812]  ignores white child rapists.
[01:57:10.812 --> 01:57:15.935]  And I bet you, I bet you toddlers probably, a lot of them are probably minorities, folks.
[01:57:15.935 --> 01:57:22.279]  I mean, where do you think, I mean, they're getting these kids from Haiti.
[01:57:22.279 --> 01:57:33.506]  So... I'm sorry, it's just so sick.
[01:57:33.506 --> 01:57:34.547]  I just can't believe this, man.
[01:57:35.444 --> 01:57:38.726]  Laura Sillsby gets caught trafficking children across the Haitian border.
[01:57:38.726 --> 01:57:40.367]  Now she runs the Amber Alert program.
[01:57:40.367 --> 01:57:47.072]  I mean, folks, we're going to be judged by God.
[01:57:47.072 --> 01:57:58.840]  But let me tell you, if we don't fight for this stuff right now, if we don't fight these people, these child rapists, these deceivers of humanity now, I mean, God is going to judge us too.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:04.664]  And we may not go to hell, but we're not going to have a seat in the front row of heaven.
[01:58:07.039 --> 01:58:13.765]  Because this is, uh, I mean, again, you've got tens of thousands of people marching for black trans lives.
[01:58:13.765 --> 01:58:14.766]  What a joke.
[01:58:14.766 --> 01:58:19.670]  But Governor Cuomo gets to murder thousands of people in a nursing home?
[01:58:19.670 --> 01:58:22.273]  Pedophiles in Florida get to rape children?
[01:58:22.273 --> 01:58:23.914]  And no, Mark, no protests.
[01:58:23.914 --> 01:58:24.855]  But think about it.
[01:58:24.855 --> 01:58:26.417]  Think about the hate-whitey media.
[01:58:27.847 --> 01:58:36.037]  It has a perfect opportunity to show you the faces of some of the most evil, wicked, disgusting men on the face of the earth, mostly white, raping children, and they don't do it.
[01:58:36.037 --> 01:58:45.708]  That tells you that protecting pedophiles is a bigger agenda in the media than Get Whitey, which you're seeing is a huge agenda, but think about that.
[01:58:45.708 --> 01:58:46.930]  They'd rather protect pedophiles.
[01:58:47.867 --> 01:58:51.911]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[01:58:51.911 --> 01:58:53.472]  The first of its kind.
[01:58:53.472 --> 01:58:58.457]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[01:58:58.457 --> 01:59:01.480]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:04.562]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[01:59:04.562 --> 01:59:07.665]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[01:59:07.665 --> 01:59:10.168]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[01:59:10.728 --> 01:59:13.129]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[01:59:13.129 --> 01:59:14.929]  It's great to keep with you.
[01:59:14.929 --> 01:59:21.210]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[01:59:21.210 --> 01:59:22.751]  We're really excited about it.
[01:59:22.751 --> 01:59:24.911]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[01:59:24.911 --> 01:59:36.394]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[01:59:36.874 --> 01:59:50.423]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at infowarestore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself.
[01:59:50.423 --> 01:59:57.027]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:59:57.027 --> 01:59:59.549]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:59:59.549 --> 02:00:02.251]  Alright, we're getting your calls aggregated right now.
[02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:06.145]  We'll be going to your calls for the rest of this hour.
[02:00:06.145 --> 02:00:10.108]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:00:10.108 --> 02:00:12.209]  It is here.
[02:00:12.209 --> 02:00:14.491]  Baby Lives Matter onesie.
[02:00:14.491 --> 02:00:16.513]  Baby Lives Matter t-shirt.
[02:00:16.513 --> 02:00:20.356]  You know, I love this thing so much, I just may go make a baby just so I can have one.
[02:00:20.356 --> 02:00:23.558]  Just so I can put the Baby Lives Matter onesie.
[02:00:23.558 --> 02:00:30.543]  Because see, the left sits here all day long with their propaganda that has no
[02:00:32.529 --> 02:00:33.370]  We're good to go.
[02:00:54.207 --> 02:01:00.431]  In America, if you're black, the odds of you being killed in the womb are higher than being killed by a police officer.
[02:01:00.431 --> 02:01:05.174]  The odds of you being killed by another black man are higher than you being killed by a police officer.
[02:01:05.174 --> 02:01:08.076]  But none of that matters!
[02:01:08.076 --> 02:01:23.346]  None of that matters because the Democrat Party has to fundraise, and in order to fundraise, they have to lie to their voters and deceive them into thinking they're oppressed victims so that you give them money to help the problem that they've been claiming that they're going to fix for 50 years, when the truth is they're actually behind all of it.
[02:01:24.502 --> 02:01:25.663]  Like Colin Kaepernick.
[02:01:25.663 --> 02:01:32.090]  Colin Kaepernick is a rich white man pretending to be an oppressed black man.
[02:01:32.090 --> 02:01:35.935]  And he's all paid for by Communist China with Nike as the front company.
[02:01:38.939 --> 02:01:41.401]  So we fight against that propaganda.
[02:01:41.401 --> 02:01:43.943]  We give you the opportunity to fight against that propaganda.
[02:01:43.943 --> 02:01:45.604]  Baby Lives Matter onesie.
[02:01:45.604 --> 02:01:46.745]  Put it on your baby.
[02:01:46.745 --> 02:01:48.847]  Baby Lives Matter t-shirt.
[02:01:48.847 --> 02:01:50.328]  Put it on your kid.
[02:01:50.328 --> 02:01:54.711]  And then when someone questions you or says you're insensitive, you stand up and you say, really?
[02:01:54.711 --> 02:01:58.875]  So, you like 50 million black babies being aborted in America?
[02:02:00.632 --> 02:02:10.915]  You realize that it's more dangerous for a black American, the odds are greater that they'll be killed by a fellow black American or that they will be killed in the womb?
[02:02:10.915 --> 02:02:12.675]  Do you realize that?
[02:02:12.675 --> 02:02:15.836]  And then watch them squirm.
[02:02:15.836 --> 02:02:22.058]  No folks, it's, you know what?
[02:02:22.058 --> 02:02:25.399]  We're gonna really have to change our mindset heading into this election.
[02:02:26.544 --> 02:02:30.328]  Because we, I understand, people don't like putting people in uncomfortable positions.
[02:02:30.328 --> 02:02:33.712]  They don't like being the agitator or the aggressor.
[02:02:33.712 --> 02:02:35.694]  But, folks, now is the time.
[02:02:35.694 --> 02:02:38.358]  I'm telling you.
[02:02:38.358 --> 02:02:41.882]  It's time to start psychologically torturing leftists.
[02:02:41.882 --> 02:02:43.383]  With facts.
[02:02:43.383 --> 02:02:45.586]  That's all it is.
[02:02:45.586 --> 02:02:46.307]  That's all you have to do.
[02:02:47.577 --> 02:02:49.317]  Wear your Baby Lives Matter t-shirt.
[02:02:49.317 --> 02:02:50.037]  Take your baby out.
[02:02:50.037 --> 02:02:51.098]  Someone wants to harass you.
[02:02:51.098 --> 02:02:52.938]  You tell them the facts.
[02:02:52.938 --> 02:02:55.599]  You make them own their ignorance.
[02:02:55.599 --> 02:02:58.419]  You say, Black Lives Matter, do they?
[02:02:58.419 --> 02:02:59.859]  Hey, that's insensitive.
[02:02:59.859 --> 02:03:01.160]  You're mocking Black Lives Matter.
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:02.320]  You say, oh, Black Lives Matter?
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:03.680]  They say, yeah, Black Lives Matter.
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.761]  You say, oh, what did you do about the 50 million black babies aborted?
[02:03:07.761 --> 02:03:08.841]  Well, that's different.
[02:03:08.841 --> 02:03:09.261]  Oh, okay.
[02:03:09.261 --> 02:03:13.042]  What did you do about the black cops that are murdered in cold blood by Black Lives Matter?
[02:03:14.889 --> 02:03:17.150]  See, because they never show this on the news, so they don't think it exists.
[02:03:17.150 --> 02:03:18.291]  But they know it's all true.
[02:03:18.291 --> 02:03:21.533]  We're all connected in this consciousness.
[02:03:21.533 --> 02:03:27.236]  So we're constantly sending and receiving information, even if we're not getting it.
[02:03:27.236 --> 02:03:28.557]  So they know it's all true.
[02:03:28.557 --> 02:03:33.340]  They know black-on-black crime in the city is the biggest crime you can find.
[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:40.063]  They know that the odds are, if you're black, it's a lot higher odds that you'll be killed by a black person or killed in the womb than killed by a cop.
[02:03:40.063 --> 02:03:40.724]  They know all that.
[02:03:41.650 --> 02:03:44.110]  But the truth doesn't help them fundraise.
[02:03:44.110 --> 02:03:49.891]  The truth doesn't get them to the next level of their political power.
[02:03:49.891 --> 02:04:00.013]  So it's time for you to own this and psychologically torture leftists when they want to come at you for wearing a Baby Lives Matter shirt.
[02:04:00.013 --> 02:04:07.214]  Because I'm telling you folks, this whole thing, oh, wear a mask, oh, shut down your business, oh, you're racist, all of that is psychological torture of you!
[02:04:07.214 --> 02:04:09.795]  It's time to fight back.
[02:04:09.795 --> 02:04:10.815]  It's time to flip it on them.
[02:04:12.216 --> 02:04:12.877]  I'm ready, man.
[02:04:12.877 --> 02:04:16.439]  I mean, believe me.
[02:04:16.439 --> 02:04:31.491]  I don't want to go around to these stores and be nagging people, hey, you know, to tell me to wear a mask and tell them how the whole thing's fake, but I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get that spirit that's just total war.
[02:04:31.491 --> 02:04:35.254]  Just total war mode.
[02:04:35.254 --> 02:04:37.996]  For facts and truth and the reality and for America.
[02:04:39.298 --> 02:04:46.560]  And as soon as we start getting activated like that, we will retake this country so quick, it's just a matter of taking action.
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:53.282]  Alright, let's go out to the phone lines now here on the Alex Jones Show, but Infowarsstore.com, folks.
[02:04:53.282 --> 02:04:55.682]  Get your Baby Lives Matter t-shirt and onesie.
[02:04:55.682 --> 02:04:58.263]  Let's start on the phone lines with Jeff in Missouri.
[02:04:58.263 --> 02:05:00.643]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:05:00.643 --> 02:05:01.524]  You hear me?
[02:05:01.524 --> 02:05:02.704]  Yep, go ahead, Jeff.
[02:05:02.704 --> 02:05:03.204]  Okay.
[02:05:03.204 --> 02:05:06.865]  Alright, I'm talking to the crew right now because I want you guys to pull up a video while we talk.
[02:05:07.421 --> 02:05:16.683]  Go to BlueLivesMatter.blue and scroll down just a little bit and you'll see it'll say June 16th video.
[02:05:16.683 --> 02:05:22.925]  Teens allegedly yell Black Lives Matter as they beat gas station customer.
[02:05:22.925 --> 02:05:27.326]  And it's a group of six African American gentlemen and
[02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:34.635]  Apparently they wanted to cut this guy in line, and he was up paying for stuff, being like, hey, I'm almost done.
[02:05:34.635 --> 02:05:36.276]  I'll be done in just a second.
[02:05:36.276 --> 02:05:39.738]  Goes outside and they just beat him senselessly.
[02:05:39.738 --> 02:05:43.440]  There's no bad audio or anything, so if the crew wants to play it, that's fine.
[02:05:58.070 --> 02:06:08.659]  I don't have much context but it's this woman standing up to clearly some agitated black man who thinks that violence is the answer because that's what he's been taught by the Democrats.
[02:06:08.659 --> 02:06:16.105]  He'll end up in jail and he takes a skateboard and whips a woman in the head with it.
[02:06:16.105 --> 02:06:17.026]  That's attempted murder.
[02:06:17.026 --> 02:06:21.529]  This guy should be in jail for 50 years but because of
[02:06:23.615 --> 02:06:34.093]  The way black people are treated now and they have all these protections with the ACLU and all this stuff, this guy probably won't see a second in jail for this attempted murder right here.
[02:06:34.093 --> 02:06:36.276]  And that's a black lady!
[02:06:36.276 --> 02:06:36.817]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:06:36.817 --> 02:06:37.098]  Oh, yeah.
[02:06:38.698 --> 02:06:39.959]  Find that video I was talking about.
[02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:41.579]  BlueLivesMatter.blue.
[02:06:41.579 --> 02:06:42.299]  Find that video.
[02:06:42.299 --> 02:06:43.460]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:44.460]  Well, we're searching for it now.
[02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:48.681]  There's another video of a guy who claims this guy called him or said the n-word.
[02:06:48.681 --> 02:06:49.562]  There's no proof of that.
[02:06:49.562 --> 02:06:50.302]  He just made it up.
[02:06:50.302 --> 02:06:54.443]  He just wanted a reason to beat this white guy senseless in the middle of the mall.
[02:06:54.443 --> 02:06:58.044]  And so, look, this is all being driven by the media.
[02:06:58.044 --> 02:07:02.506]  And then conservatives or anybody is too afraid to call it out for what it is.
[02:07:03.479 --> 02:07:05.621]  And so then it just continues.
[02:07:05.621 --> 02:07:11.086]  And so I don't know if they're having trouble finding this video or they found it, but yeah, there's no doubt this is all being driven.
[02:07:11.086 --> 02:07:17.372]  The Democrats, the media, they're trying to start race riots, and they're actually bringing racism back.
[02:07:17.372 --> 02:07:20.574]  They're literally single-handedly destroying Martin Luther King's dream.
[02:07:20.574 --> 02:07:22.216]  Absolutely.
[02:07:22.216 --> 02:07:26.760]  Have you seen the actual movie, V for Vendetta, that you guys did the commercial on it?
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.402]  Have you personally seen it?
[02:07:28.402 --> 02:07:28.582]  Yes.
[02:07:30.262 --> 02:07:32.283]  Have you heard of the group Anonymous on Twitter?
[02:07:32.283 --> 02:07:35.744]  They have like 8 million followers.
[02:07:35.744 --> 02:07:41.707]  And they think that they are on the side of freedom, when actually they're on the side of tyranny.
[02:07:41.707 --> 02:07:50.190]  Well here's the thing about Anonymous, anything anonymous, this is why I always tell the Q people, anything anonymous can always be hijacked and you'll never know it.
[02:07:50.190 --> 02:07:51.291]  Exactly.
[02:07:51.291 --> 02:07:52.271]  Exactly.
[02:07:52.271 --> 02:07:53.351]  So maybe that happened.
[02:07:53.351 --> 02:07:55.152]  Jeff, I gotta jump, thank you for the call.
[02:07:55.152 --> 02:07:56.873]  Eric in Ohio, go ahead Eric.
[02:08:00.017 --> 02:08:01.878]  Good, thank you.
[02:08:01.878 --> 02:08:06.401]  I just want to start off by thanking everybody at InfoWars for what they do.
[02:08:06.401 --> 02:08:09.123]  Been listening for years and years now.
[02:08:09.123 --> 02:08:09.784]  Well, thank you.
[02:08:09.784 --> 02:08:12.606]  It wouldn't be possible without your support, brother.
[02:08:12.606 --> 02:08:14.427]  We're in this together.
[02:08:14.427 --> 02:08:17.209]  They call you guys a right wing group.
[02:08:17.677 --> 02:08:23.721]  And I don't know how they forgot, you know, all the years where Alex Jones was getting on George Bush when he was president.
[02:08:23.721 --> 02:08:28.804]  Oh yeah, and how we've been anti-war, anti-war on drugs, anti-militarized police.
[02:08:28.804 --> 02:08:31.545]  Yeah, it's all propaganda.
[02:08:31.545 --> 02:08:38.029]  You know, now everybody sees through this coronavirus that I talk to, they see through the Black Lives Matter movement.
[02:08:38.029 --> 02:08:39.590]  I've been sharing your videos and
[02:08:40.464 --> 02:08:47.408]  Getting the word out there, but just the fact that everybody can see through the crap that they're trying to do just, you know, goes to show you.
[02:08:47.408 --> 02:08:49.689]  Well, and you know, here's my judgment of that too, Eric.
[02:08:49.689 --> 02:08:52.451]  It's not because we see through it.
[02:08:52.451 --> 02:08:55.792]  I genuinely believe now that the left knows it.
[02:08:55.792 --> 02:08:57.533]  I don't even think they're being fooled by it.
[02:08:57.533 --> 02:08:59.555]  They just like playing along with it.
[02:08:59.555 --> 02:09:01.376]  They just are driven by hate.
[02:09:01.376 --> 02:09:07.399]  So even though they know it's all a front and all a lie, they go along with it because they hate you and they know that it bothers you.
[02:09:08.479 --> 02:09:12.760]  Oh, well, they're just hoping that we're all done and we hope, you know, they know we forget things.
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:15.501]  We are a forgetful species being humans that we are.
[02:09:15.501 --> 02:09:19.822]  And they just hope that we forget all the nonsense that they say or that they do.
[02:09:19.822 --> 02:09:22.383]  You know, they say one thing and then do another.
[02:09:22.383 --> 02:09:23.403]  It's their policy.
[02:09:23.403 --> 02:09:27.485]  And so they're getting ready to roll up another COVID-19 hoax, I'm telling you.
[02:09:27.485 --> 02:09:28.765]  And folks, they're lying in the media.
[02:09:29.370 --> 02:09:32.112]  Oh, 600 new cases, isn't it?
[02:09:32.112 --> 02:09:41.999]  Folks, they're testing literally everyone, and then they get the test results back in one fell swoop from tens of thousands of tests, so of course the numbers are gonna spike!
[02:09:41.999 --> 02:09:43.019]  It's all a game!
[02:09:43.019 --> 02:09:44.981]  It's all a game, folks!
[02:09:51.767 --> 02:09:59.963]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the
[02:10:01.696 --> 02:10:03.538]  Race riot hoax of 2020.
[02:10:03.538 --> 02:10:06.920]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:13.666]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[02:10:13.666 --> 02:10:18.990]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:21.472]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[02:10:21.472 --> 02:10:22.293]  That's why now
[02:10:22.913 --> 02:10:32.903]  More than ever we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[02:10:32.903 --> 02:10:37.087]  But thanks to you and our crew we are still on air.
[02:10:37.087 --> 02:10:41.332]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[02:10:41.332 --> 02:10:44.335]  InfoWars.com lives!
[02:10:46.209 --> 02:10:54.409]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:11:00.443]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:11:00.443 --> 02:11:02.785]  Super Male Vitality!

[02:11:22.779 --> 02:11:23.479]  Yes.
[02:11:23.479 --> 02:11:28.382]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[02:11:28.382 --> 02:11:35.305]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.

[02:11:38.227 --> 02:11:41.028]  Never been a better time than right now.
[02:11:41.028 --> 02:11:48.792]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:11:48.792 --> 02:11:51.454]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:04.039 --> 02:12:05.280]  You found it.
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:07.302]  The tip of the spear.
[02:12:07.302 --> 02:12:15.688]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:12:15.688 --> 02:12:20.772]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:20.772 --> 02:12:23.674]  Let's not waste any time.
[02:12:23.674 --> 02:12:28.098]  And let's go to Leroy calling in from Missouri.
[02:12:28.098 --> 02:12:28.898]  Go ahead, Leroy.
[02:12:28.898 --> 02:12:30.640]  Hey, Owen.
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:31.660]  You got me, buddy?
[02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:32.221]  Loud and clear.
[02:12:33.604 --> 02:12:40.629]  Hey man, I'm just calling to tell you I love the whole wartime conservative idea, man.
[02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:47.553]  I'm glad Buck Sexton is hitting on this because I don't understand where the Republicans are, you know?
[02:12:47.553 --> 02:12:50.615]  They basically are Democrats to me at this point in a lot of ways.
[02:12:50.615 --> 02:12:58.540]  I argue with as many of my Republican friends about the Republicans not doing anything as I do with a lot of my Democrat friends, you know?
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:02.943]  I mean, you know, we got Lindsey Graham, who's obviously
[02:13:03.547 --> 02:13:07.711]  You know a Democrat who's basically running everything for us in the Senate right now.
[02:13:07.711 --> 02:13:09.432]  You're not going to get that done with him.
[02:13:09.432 --> 02:13:10.874]  Oh, I don't trust Lindsey Graham.
[02:13:10.874 --> 02:13:21.003]  And by the way, Lindsey Graham is kind of the go-between, for lack of a better term right now, between us getting all the information about Schiff and the whole Russian collusion.
[02:13:21.003 --> 02:13:23.065]  I mean, he's the one kind of blockading it.
[02:13:24.219 --> 02:13:26.021]  I mean, he literally is!
[02:13:26.021 --> 02:13:27.302]  I mean, I like Josh Hawley.
[02:13:27.302 --> 02:13:32.886]  He sounds great and everything, but, you know, I'm a big Eric Greiden supporter, and I'm glad that he's rerunning again at 24.
[02:13:32.886 --> 02:13:34.307]  Oh, he is running again!
[02:13:34.307 --> 02:13:35.888]  Why didn't they just give him his seat back?
[02:13:35.888 --> 02:13:38.650]  There was literally a coup by the FBI to get him out of office.
[02:13:38.650 --> 02:13:40.832]  They got caught!
[02:13:40.832 --> 02:13:42.313]  Parsons is not our governor.
[02:13:42.313 --> 02:13:46.076]  I mean, I tell everybody that all the time, and he acts like he is.
[02:13:46.076 --> 02:13:49.099]  The arrogance of these people is just maddening to me.
[02:13:49.099 --> 02:13:53.382]  If he had any honor, he'd have gave up his seat, he'd have had another election, he'd have done something.
[02:13:53.949 --> 02:13:56.111]  But I do have one question for you guys.
[02:13:56.111 --> 02:14:00.654]  Me and some buddies here from Missouri, man, are going to Tulsa this weekend.
[02:14:00.654 --> 02:14:01.955]  We are pumped up.
[02:14:01.955 --> 02:14:02.995]  Are you guys going to be there?
[02:14:02.995 --> 02:14:04.817]  I haven't heard you guys talk much about it.
[02:14:04.817 --> 02:14:07.158]  Well, I'll just go ahead.
[02:14:07.158 --> 02:14:08.359]  We are going to be there.
[02:14:08.359 --> 02:14:12.242]  We didn't want to build it up for obvious reasons, but it's already such a huge event.
[02:14:12.242 --> 02:14:13.343]  I don't think it matters at this point.
[02:14:13.343 --> 02:14:16.865]  But we will have a presence in Tulsa, yes.
[02:14:16.865 --> 02:14:18.366]  And this thing is going to be so big.
[02:14:18.366 --> 02:14:19.847]  And let me tell you something.
[02:14:19.847 --> 02:14:20.688]  I just call it like it is.
[02:14:20.688 --> 02:14:22.009]  I haven't even mentioned Trump's name yet.
[02:14:23.254 --> 02:14:29.336]  But, uh, and I think he is going to have the rally, but they were thinking about canceling it, folks, and there was a lawsuit.
[02:14:29.336 --> 02:14:39.779]  Now, an Oklahoma judge basically blocked the lawsuit against Trump having the rally, so it looks like they'll have it, but him moving the rally from Friday to Saturday, I think, was a mistake, but at this point,
[02:14:40.615 --> 02:14:43.856]  They, it does look like they aren't going to cancel it again.
[02:14:43.856 --> 02:14:51.218]  And so Saturday in Tulsa is going to be, I mean, look, it's hard to measure how many people are going to come up.
[02:14:51.218 --> 02:14:55.300]  I'm guessing 50,000 Trump supporters minimum.
[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:56.000]  Minimum.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.282]  And you'll probably have a couple thousand, you know, leftist protesters at max.
[02:15:01.282 --> 02:15:02.322]  I mean, it's just going to be wild.
[02:15:03.772 --> 02:15:06.454]  And I'll have my free Alex Jones t-shirt on.
[02:15:06.454 --> 02:15:09.637]  And I was listening to Savannah last night on your show.
[02:15:09.637 --> 02:15:12.319]  She sings a little black film, but don't be.
[02:15:12.319 --> 02:15:14.460]  I mean, there's no reason for that.
[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:16.222]  This is all psychological.
[02:15:16.222 --> 02:15:21.466]  They are just a puppet that could be easily smacked down.
[02:15:21.466 --> 02:15:23.647]  And they're going to see this weekend.
[02:15:23.647 --> 02:15:27.170]  You know, we all kind of knew Trump was rallying around Trump.
[02:15:27.170 --> 02:15:30.993]  We know Trump don't know politics through and through, and he's not perfect.
[02:15:30.993 --> 02:15:33.515]  But we got to remember, hey, he's put his family
[02:15:34.088 --> 02:15:35.049]  On the line.
[02:15:35.049 --> 02:15:36.009]  You know, not too many people...
[02:16:04.328 --> 02:16:06.809]  Actually, Republican numbers would actually say he's at 85%.
[02:16:06.809 --> 02:16:09.370]  I don't really care either way.
[02:16:09.370 --> 02:16:13.931]  You can get that number to 100% if you go back on the attack like in 2016.
[02:16:13.931 --> 02:16:16.872]  But the President needs to know we have his back.
[02:16:16.872 --> 02:16:18.592]  He needs to see us saying it.
[02:16:18.592 --> 02:16:20.873]  He needs to see us saying COVID was a hoax.
[02:16:20.873 --> 02:16:23.614]  He needs to see us saying all of this is a lie to get Trump.
[02:16:23.614 --> 02:16:26.675]  And then, like, he kind of like brought the momentum.
[02:16:27.702 --> 02:16:30.303]  He was like, he was the one that kind of forced the momentum.
[02:16:30.303 --> 02:16:32.223]  Now it's like he's kind of going to the back.
[02:16:32.223 --> 02:16:36.424]  Now we need to boomerang him back with the momentum.
[02:16:36.424 --> 02:16:38.385]  I think he may be waiting for it.
[02:16:38.385 --> 02:16:44.406]  Look at his family, what he's put on the line, all the millions of dollars he could be making and all that.
[02:16:44.406 --> 02:16:47.827]  And honestly, a lot of people just sit back and take all this stuff.
[02:16:47.827 --> 02:16:49.927]  I think Trump might be waiting.
[02:16:49.927 --> 02:16:53.028]  I think if we go and we stand up, I think Trump
[02:16:54.087 --> 02:17:05.225]  Yeah, and you know that's a great point because I have this story here from Slate, and this is all optics, and it's how Trump lost the military.
[02:17:06.465 --> 02:17:10.988]  And really, they're just taking the traitors out of the military that are coming out against Trump.
[02:17:10.988 --> 02:17:13.529]  They're obviously just traitors.
[02:17:13.529 --> 02:17:15.890]  But in general, Trump has the military.
[02:17:15.890 --> 02:17:21.734]  Maybe not the top generals that got put in there by Obama and other such, but the real military.
[02:17:21.734 --> 02:17:26.817]  I mean, the Green Berets, the Marines, the infantry.
[02:17:26.817 --> 02:17:29.478]  Trump has all of them and their support no matter what.
[02:17:29.478 --> 02:17:31.619]  So this is all, again, a psychological thing.
[02:17:31.619 --> 02:17:32.840]  Oh, Trump doesn't have the military.
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:33.501]  He's losing.
[02:17:34.451 --> 02:17:35.972]  Pleasure to talk with you, Owen.
[02:17:35.972 --> 02:17:40.114]  I just wanted to piggyback on what you were talking about earlier, wartime conservatism.
[02:18:04.733 --> 02:18:14.980]  And if anything's being told right now, it's that we are going to hit a second wave, and they're definitely going to take more than just a mile this time.
[02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:16.941]  We gave them a niche, they took a mile.
[02:18:16.941 --> 02:18:30.990]  Yeah, they'll hammer in the contact tracing, and they'll start arresting you for violating whatever protocols, but if that goes down, folks, I'm telling you, just say you're protesting, just say you're with BLM, and then, you know, oh, hey, I'm with BLM protesting.
[02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:31.670]  Oh, I didn't realize.
[02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:32.251]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:18:33.956 --> 02:18:37.438]  Yeah, I think this time around, though, it's going to be up to us.
[02:18:37.438 --> 02:18:45.421]  I mean, they're making big chess moves against us, and this time around, it's going to be us on us to basically let them know and tell them, hey, you know what?
[02:18:45.421 --> 02:18:46.562]  You're not going to do this.
[02:18:46.562 --> 02:18:48.723]  You're not going to continue doing this.
[02:18:48.723 --> 02:18:55.426]  I mean, I'm in a community here in Chula Vista, where we had the South, the South Bay United at the Coliseum take their
[02:18:56.301 --> 02:18:56.461]  I don't
[02:19:12.993 --> 02:19:26.217]  These ideals and these things being in their core to come out and... Well, you know, where is... See, this is a great point, because where are the hardcore Christian conservatives on all this LGBTQ stuff that's going on, being force-fed to your kids?
[02:19:26.217 --> 02:19:28.917]  They're talking about pee-pees and wee-wees at the Supreme Court.
[02:19:28.917 --> 02:19:31.018]  That is a joke!
[02:19:31.018 --> 02:19:33.659]  That is a joke!
[02:19:33.659 --> 02:19:35.079]  And we just sit here and take it?
[02:19:35.079 --> 02:19:42.001]  It's like, hey, we got insurrection going on, but yeah, Neil Gorsuch, write about a pee-pee and a wee-wee.
[02:19:43.996 --> 02:20:02.866]  Again, I think it's going to be on us to show the blue state, the powers that be in the blue state, that we're not going to tolerate this anymore and that if it's going to come to us and exercising our Second Amendment, exercising our full constitutional rights, that's where it's going to need to be.
[02:20:02.866 --> 02:20:11.111]  On the other hand, with the Trump rally coming up, it's also going to be on us to express all these things and express this whole
[02:20:11.789 --> 02:20:12.129]  I don't know.
[02:20:35.225 --> 02:20:37.327]  He'll look at the thousands turning up in Brooklyn.
[02:20:37.327 --> 02:20:38.929]  Those are your Biden rallies.
[02:20:38.929 --> 02:20:43.474]  No, they're not Biden rallies, they're anti-Trump rallies, but there is a support base to vote Trump out.
[02:20:43.474 --> 02:20:44.435]  It's basically Trump vs. Trump.
[02:20:45.017 --> 02:20:54.946]  What InfoWars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[02:20:54.946 --> 02:20:58.810]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[02:20:58.810 --> 02:21:05.416]  And now, open world government is being established with an endgame to depopulate the planet.
[02:21:06.136 --> 02:21:11.538]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[02:21:11.538 --> 02:21:14.139]  You must decide which side you're on.
[02:21:14.139 --> 02:21:22.383]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[02:21:22.383 --> 02:21:27.625]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[02:21:27.625 --> 02:21:29.166]  The delusions must end now.
[02:21:30.126 --> 02:21:35.548]  InfoWars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[02:21:35.548 --> 02:21:39.470]  Most people that are aware of the New World Order decide to join it out of fear.
[02:21:39.470 --> 02:21:40.811]  They are truly fools.
[02:21:40.811 --> 02:21:43.212]  We must fight this, or lose our souls.
[02:21:44.642 --> 02:21:47.084]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, Great Suppliers.
[02:21:47.084 --> 02:21:50.026]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[02:21:50.026 --> 02:21:51.087]  It's the highest quality.
[02:21:51.087 --> 02:21:52.508]  They've got it.
[02:21:52.508 --> 02:21:58.913]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[02:21:58.913 --> 02:22:01.435]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[02:22:01.435 --> 02:22:04.797]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[02:22:04.797 --> 02:22:09.641]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[02:22:09.641 --> 02:22:12.964]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[02:22:14.193 --> 02:22:16.934]  We're going to still go down the hard road now.
[02:22:16.934 --> 02:22:22.856]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[02:22:22.856 --> 02:22:24.376]  You need to get high quality storable food.
[02:22:24.376 --> 02:22:25.557]  It's something you need.
[02:22:25.557 --> 02:22:36.581]  We have high quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast and 360 web, so please take care of your storable foods needs at infowarestore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:39.382]  It's in great containers, high quality, last 25 years.
[02:22:39.382 --> 02:22:43.383]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:22:43.863 --> 02:22:48.286]  Hello, Rob Dew here with InfoWarsStore.com, and I've got some good news and some bad news.

[02:23:38.413 --> 02:23:47.397]  Our original Mega Flash specials have ended, but our new DE specials have launched at InfoWareStore.com!
[02:23:47.397 --> 02:23:50.038]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:04.792 --> 02:24:05.933]  Big Brother.
[02:24:05.933 --> 02:24:07.734]  Mainstream media.
[02:24:07.734 --> 02:24:09.596]  Government cover-ups.
[02:24:09.596 --> 02:24:11.318]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:24:11.318 --> 02:24:12.979]  Well, so does he.
[02:24:12.979 --> 02:24:18.084]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:24:18.084 --> 02:24:21.127]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:24:22.739 --> 02:24:33.868]  Eric Swalwell is virtue signaling right now on the Senate floor, excuse me, the Congressional floor, saying, Republicans don't even care about black people!
[02:24:33.868 --> 02:24:38.432]  Tell me, Matt Gaetz, can you unequivocally say that black lives matter?
[02:24:38.432 --> 02:24:42.695]  And Matt Gaetz says, I can unequivocally say that all lives matter.
[02:24:42.695 --> 02:24:47.499]  Eric Swalwell is a dirt bag.
[02:24:47.499 --> 02:24:48.440]  Dirt bag.
[02:24:50.759 --> 02:24:54.503]  Let me go back to your phone calls before I start getting off on a tangent here.
[02:24:54.503 --> 02:24:58.426]  Let's go to Chase in California.
[02:24:58.426 --> 02:24:59.067]  Go ahead, Chase.
[02:24:59.067 --> 02:25:00.048]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:00.048 --> 02:25:01.309]  Chase the Patriot on YouTube.
[02:25:01.309 --> 02:25:02.891]  Go ahead.
[02:25:02.891 --> 02:25:05.433]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, and I want to start off.
[02:25:05.433 --> 02:25:09.978]  It sounds like old Swalwell there was letting off a little hot gas, huh?
[02:25:11.004 --> 02:25:12.065]  He's known for that one.
[02:25:12.065 --> 02:25:18.871]  Well, you know, their buddy down there, Ed Buck, who probably provides them with, uh, you know, well, God knows what, in that drug rape dungeon.
[02:25:18.871 --> 02:25:23.415]  He's in jail, so, uh, they're probably running a little short on that, but, yeah, you know, it's okay.
[02:25:23.415 --> 02:25:30.101]  Adam Schiff and Swalwell, real stand-up gentlemen, the kind of guys you want, uh, you know, babysitting your kids and making you a pastrami sandwich and stuff.
[02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:33.102]  Yeah, I don't know about old Shippey there.
[02:25:33.102 --> 02:25:35.905]  I think he's a little nervous with some of the papers coming out right now.
[02:25:35.905 --> 02:25:37.406]  But you bring up a good point, too.
[02:25:37.406 --> 02:25:38.848]  Old Lindsey Graham there.
[02:25:38.848 --> 02:25:47.517]  He's sitting there as the head of the Judiciary Committee for the Senate, and he's just kind of twiddling his thumbs and not getting anything done at all, it seems like.
[02:25:47.517 --> 02:25:51.401]  But thankfully, you know, kind of what I was calling in about, we have Senator Hawley there.
[02:25:51.401 --> 02:25:53.543]  He's only been in there a couple years now, really.
[02:25:54.048 --> 02:26:02.054]  But he is setting the example for maybe that next generation or that next mentality for the conservative politician.
[02:26:02.054 --> 02:26:16.784]  And, you know, whether it's trying to take on the big tech company or, you know, what he's doing today, there's a lot of things that are good to see coming out of Senator Hawley, because our court system all the way back to Marbury versus Madison has been corrupted.
[02:26:16.784 --> 02:26:20.907]  And whether you like the ruling today or you dislike the ruling today,
[02:26:21.491 --> 02:26:23.052]  It's completely politicized.
[02:26:23.052 --> 02:26:27.616]  The bench has gone completely to the left or to the right, as they say.
[02:26:27.616 --> 02:26:29.778]  But really, it needs to be the Constitution.
[02:26:29.778 --> 02:26:31.199]  It needs to be the Bill of Rights.
[02:26:31.199 --> 02:26:32.860]  That's what they need to worry about.
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:33.761]  Well, but think about this.
[02:26:33.761 --> 02:26:37.544]  Think about what is actually happening with these Supreme Court decisions.
[02:26:37.544 --> 02:26:39.566]  And this is how you know everything is so lost.
[02:26:40.708 --> 02:26:43.751]  Because if you ask me, like, the left doesn't want the police.
[02:26:43.751 --> 02:26:45.713]  Okay, so you don't want the government involved in your life.
[02:26:45.713 --> 02:26:47.255]  That's really what you're saying.
[02:26:47.255 --> 02:26:50.618]  I would think that most conservatives agree with that notion.
[02:26:50.618 --> 02:26:52.300]  I don't want the government involved in my life either.
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:55.624]  The problem is, the left has a double standard.
[02:26:55.624 --> 02:27:00.108]  They want the government involved in your life when it's politically advantageous to them.
[02:27:00.669 --> 02:27:10.252]  They want the government involved in your life when they can use it as a social justice, militarized attack on you and the country.
[02:27:10.252 --> 02:27:13.473]  So this whole gay, lesbian rights thing is the latest.
[02:27:13.473 --> 02:27:17.354]  So they've now made it that... And by the way, you know what's gonna happen, folks?
[02:27:17.354 --> 02:27:21.196]  Because you fire a black person or you fire a gay person, they sue you immediately.
[02:27:21.196 --> 02:27:22.256]  Nobody's gonna hire them anymore.
[02:27:23.012 --> 02:27:25.233]  Because you just get sued if they get let go.
[02:27:25.233 --> 02:27:26.574]  So that's not going to go well.
[02:27:26.574 --> 02:27:32.256]  But for everybody out there, oh we don't want the government in our lives, we want small government, oh I don't want the police in our lives.
[02:27:32.256 --> 02:27:37.659]  So the government is now in everything you do because of a Supreme Court ruling like this.
[02:27:37.659 --> 02:27:44.422]  And so I think it's time for the Supreme Court to just rewrite all these rulings and say, you know what, the government doesn't belong in your life.
[02:27:44.422 --> 02:27:48.444]  So if you want to discriminate against somebody, then you know what, that's your right.
[02:27:49.352 --> 02:27:50.893]  And the people will decide!
[02:27:50.893 --> 02:27:59.060]  If you're an open racist, and you don't let a gay person eat at your restaurant, or a black person, you know, go to your business, guess what?
[02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:04.824]  Word is gonna get out, there's all kinds of law groups, there's all kinds of media, and those businesses will be shut down!
[02:28:04.824 --> 02:28:12.690]  We don't need the damn government ruling on this, because now they've just militarized, they've militarized all these different left-wing activist groups.
[02:28:12.690 --> 02:28:13.591]  I'm sorry, Chase, go ahead.
[02:28:14.935 --> 02:28:18.576]  And I was going to say, it doesn't matter the case, like you're saying today.
[02:28:18.576 --> 02:28:22.618]  It could be this case, or tomorrow it could be a Second Amendment case.
[02:28:22.618 --> 02:28:24.559]  Either side might get upset.
[02:28:24.559 --> 02:28:35.503]  Nine unelected people that are nominated and appointed as political appointments have control over 325 million people and how they live their lives.
[02:28:35.503 --> 02:28:38.424]  So what you're saying, Owen, real quick, I got to just ask,
[02:28:39.202 --> 02:28:44.965]  Something that my callers keep calling in and asking me about is the National Assembly and the Organic Act of 1871.
[02:28:44.965 --> 02:28:58.332]  It's the whole idea of when the United States of America became all capital letters, United States of America, and how the whole corporate America changed the way that our law system and our government interacts with us.
[02:28:58.332 --> 02:29:00.033]  Have you heard anything about that?
[02:29:00.033 --> 02:29:06.256]  No, I'd have to do more research, but there's no doubt the way everything is set up, it protects corporations more than our individual rights.
[02:29:08.072 --> 02:29:09.833]  Yeah, that's definitely the truth.
[02:29:09.833 --> 02:29:13.194]  Hey, and I appreciate the time given me and everybody out there.
[02:29:13.194 --> 02:29:14.374]  Just spread the word.
[02:29:14.374 --> 02:29:15.895]  Get your voice out there.
[02:29:15.895 --> 02:29:20.696]  Research topics and communicate with your neighbors and people at work and people at school.
[02:29:20.696 --> 02:29:22.617]  That's the one way we can override that.
[02:29:22.617 --> 02:29:23.997]  Oh yeah, no doubt.
[02:29:23.997 --> 02:29:25.698]  You gotta be a voice these days, folks.
[02:29:25.698 --> 02:29:26.358]  You have to be.
[02:29:26.358 --> 02:29:28.119]  And by the way, just an addendum to the last thing I said.
[02:29:28.119 --> 02:29:28.599]  Thanks, Chase.
[02:29:29.890 --> 02:29:36.997]  So it's a weird flux though now because it used to be that we had a government that was designed and intended to protect the rights of individuals.
[02:29:36.997 --> 02:29:38.178]  That's way gone.
[02:29:38.178 --> 02:29:41.781]  Then it got bought and controlled by the corporations and it was all about protecting their rights.
[02:29:41.781 --> 02:29:47.626]  That's why you have a secret vaccine court and you know Monsanto gets to continue operating with Roundup and such.
[02:29:47.626 --> 02:29:52.131]  But now the new thing is it only protects left-wing activists.
[02:29:52.771 --> 02:29:56.653]  Which the Democrat Party just claims they're fighting for in a fraudulent manner.
[02:29:56.653 --> 02:30:01.516]  And so now the whole system is being designed to only protect you if you're a left-wing activist.
[02:30:01.516 --> 02:30:03.817]  And they hide under all kinds of guises.
[02:30:03.817 --> 02:30:05.198]  Oh, I'm a transsexual.
[02:30:05.198 --> 02:30:06.098]  Oh, I'm gay.
[02:30:06.098 --> 02:30:07.239]  Oh, I'm a minority.
[02:30:07.239 --> 02:30:15.503]  None of that matters until the left-wing makes it matter with their political edicts and their Supreme Court decisions, which is what's going on.
[02:30:15.503 --> 02:30:16.604]  Eric in Florida.
[02:30:16.604 --> 02:30:17.324]  Go ahead, Eric.
[02:30:17.324 --> 02:30:18.625]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:20.325 --> 02:30:22.266]  Hey, shorty the destroyer.
[02:30:22.266 --> 02:30:23.847]  Hold on, let me take out a speaker.
[02:30:23.847 --> 02:30:26.729]  Alright.
[02:30:26.729 --> 02:30:27.229]  There we go.
[02:30:27.229 --> 02:30:27.990]  Alright.
[02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:29.871]  Thanks for your time, man.
[02:30:29.871 --> 02:30:30.532]  Thanks for calling.
[02:30:30.532 --> 02:30:34.434]  Yeah, and good work.
[02:30:34.434 --> 02:30:49.324]  I called a long time ago, and if you might remember, was dealing with transvestites and using
[02:30:51.022 --> 02:30:58.467]  I mentioned a girlfriend, and she worked for Capital One, and this is back in 96, 97.
[02:30:58.467 --> 02:31:09.675]  And I told her it was creating a hostile work environment, that they were cleaning their own bathroom before they'd use it, after he would.
[02:31:09.675 --> 02:31:15.939]  But I told her to go to Human Resources and all that, no matter how hard I pushed her.
[02:31:15.939 --> 02:31:17.020]  It wasn't working.
[02:31:17.020 --> 02:31:19.141]  Finally, she decided to do it.
[02:31:19.955 --> 02:31:23.118]  And they told her that they can do that.
[02:31:23.118 --> 02:31:26.381]  Now look at how far it's come.
[02:31:26.381 --> 02:31:27.341]  Well, that's my point.
[02:31:27.341 --> 02:31:32.365]  Now everything is being designed to protect left-wing agitators.
[02:31:32.365 --> 02:31:32.926]  That's it.
[02:31:32.926 --> 02:31:37.750]  Like I said, they hide under the guise of, oh, I'm gay or a minority or, you know, I cut my penis off or whatever.
[02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:41.933]  And so the whole system is now designed to protect them at all costs.
[02:31:42.814 --> 02:31:46.656]  So, the left has just politicized and corrupted everything in this country.
[02:31:46.656 --> 02:31:51.638]  And people get it now, but it's time to start not just realizing it, but pushing back against it.
[02:31:51.638 --> 02:31:52.819]  Thanks for the call, Eric.
[02:31:52.819 --> 02:31:57.341]  Alright, final caller today before we go to a special report from David Knight, Alex in Connecticut.
[02:31:57.341 --> 02:31:59.742]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:31:59.742 --> 02:32:01.082]  Hey, Owen, what's going on?
[02:32:01.082 --> 02:32:02.003]  How's it going?
[02:32:02.003 --> 02:32:03.603]  Good, thanks.
[02:32:03.603 --> 02:32:09.186]  Hey, so, yeah, Fox61.com, Worcester Square, New Haven.
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.742]  Has been home to Columbus statue and they want to take it down.
[02:32:14.742 --> 02:32:18.044]  And Middletown over here also, I guess, took down a statue.
[02:32:18.044 --> 02:32:21.706]  And I don't know if it was taken down by, you know, Antifa or anything like that.
[02:32:21.706 --> 02:32:24.667]  I think it's this towns that are doing that.
[02:32:24.667 --> 02:32:26.388]  A lot of people are upset about it.
[02:32:26.388 --> 02:32:33.691]  Some folks are saying, Hey, well, some businesses that are upset about it, want to put a Columbus statue on their property right next to it.
[02:32:33.691 --> 02:32:36.953]  So, um, a whole bunch of stuff, uh, Ned Lamont.
[02:32:37.651 --> 02:32:37.811]  I'm
[02:32:52.697 --> 02:32:57.541]  Connecticut is... You know, I'm so glad you said that, Alex, and I'm sorry, I gotta cut you off here.
[02:32:57.541 --> 02:33:08.410]  We're about to run out of time in this segment, but you just said something I forgot, and I would have mentioned this, because Ted Cruz pointed out with the Sesame Street and their LGBTQ promotion to the youth.
[02:33:08.410 --> 02:33:19.380]  Folks, okay, so if you have a cable box or you have cable or whatever, when you turn it on, even online, the first thing it goes to is your kind of local news cable provider, local news.
[02:33:20.427 --> 02:33:23.188]  And it's so propagandized now.
[02:33:23.188 --> 02:33:24.129]  It's all propaganda.
[02:33:24.129 --> 02:33:28.771]  So it's like, as soon as you turn your TV on now, you're immediately getting hit with the propaganda.
[02:33:28.771 --> 02:33:30.391]  The taste for last week and this week?
[02:33:30.391 --> 02:33:31.952]  The flavor of the week?
[02:33:31.952 --> 02:33:34.593]  LGBTQ in the classrooms.
[02:33:34.593 --> 02:33:37.454]  Drag Queen Storytime in the classrooms.
[02:33:37.454 --> 02:33:40.616]  I mean, the left wing is literally corrupting everything, folks.
[02:33:40.616 --> 02:33:42.137]  This is a threat to humanity.
[02:33:42.137 --> 02:33:42.957]  David Knight coming up.
[02:33:44.662 --> 02:33:46.403]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[02:33:46.403 --> 02:33:46.883]  You're on the air.
[02:33:46.883 --> 02:33:47.444]  Thanks for holding.
[02:33:47.444 --> 02:33:48.484]  Can you hear me?
[02:33:48.484 --> 02:33:49.125]  I sure can, sir.
[02:33:49.125 --> 02:33:49.465]  Thank you.
[02:33:49.465 --> 02:33:50.225]  Hey, Alex.
[02:33:50.225 --> 02:33:53.427]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro.
[02:33:53.427 --> 02:33:56.449]  It's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[02:33:56.449 --> 02:33:57.790]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:59.391]  I'm calling from New Brink, Connecticut.
[02:34:00.451 --> 02:34:01.893]  I just want to plug in.
[02:34:01.893 --> 02:34:06.317]  I'm a truck driver and Turbo Force has changed the way I drive.
[02:34:06.317 --> 02:34:12.963]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[02:34:12.963 --> 02:34:20.930]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.731]  Thank you for that, man.
[02:34:21.731 --> 02:34:27.376]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[02:34:27.376 --> 02:34:29.658]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[02:34:29.658 --> 02:34:32.121]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[02:34:32.121 --> 02:34:34.803]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[02:34:34.803 --> 02:34:38.827]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[02:34:38.827 --> 02:34:40.649]  And you're saying that it's made your life better?
[02:34:40.649 --> 02:34:41.370]  So that means a lot to me.
[02:34:41.370 --> 02:34:41.710]  Thank you.
[02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:43.131]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[02:34:43.979 --> 02:34:44.999]  It's finally here.
[02:34:44.999 --> 02:34:49.862]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[02:34:49.862 --> 02:34:56.464]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[02:34:56.464 --> 02:34:58.505]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[02:34:58.505 --> 02:35:07.329]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[02:35:07.589 --> 02:35:14.096]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[02:35:14.096 --> 02:35:15.677]  I can personally feel the difference.
[02:35:15.677 --> 02:35:23.805]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[02:35:23.805 --> 02:35:28.230]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[02:35:28.610 --> 02:35:33.637]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today.
[02:35:33.637 --> 02:35:41.108]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[02:35:41.108 --> 02:35:42.590]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:35:44.844 --> 02:35:53.148]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[02:35:53.148 --> 02:36:04.833]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[02:36:04.833 --> 02:36:12.176]  This is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up
[02:36:12.176 --> 02:36:12.376]  I'm good.
[02:36:28.254 --> 02:36:32.277]  They're going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[02:36:32.277 --> 02:36:38.221]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world and they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[02:36:38.221 --> 02:36:42.684]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[02:36:42.684 --> 02:36:44.746]  InfoWars.com.
[02:36:44.746 --> 02:36:55.513]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run.
[02:36:56.874 --> 02:37:03.980]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards, they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins.
[02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:09.965]  But all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over, and they die.
[02:37:09.965 --> 02:37:12.186]  Then you go bag them and haul them back in.
[02:37:13.047 --> 02:37:16.550]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:22.435]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart.
[02:37:22.435 --> 02:37:27.520]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:31.744]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to the UN, and I believe their numbers.
[02:37:32.304 --> 02:37:37.088]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[02:37:37.088 --> 02:37:46.917]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[02:37:46.917 --> 02:37:49.539]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:58.846 --> 02:38:01.147]  All right, we're going to go to David Knight real quick, folks.
[02:38:01.147 --> 02:38:06.168]  But Joe Biden is being propped up by Fox News right now.
[02:38:06.168 --> 02:38:08.789]  He's giving a speech in Darby, Pennsylvania.
[02:38:08.789 --> 02:38:11.250]  I guarantee you it's an empty room.
[02:38:11.250 --> 02:38:13.510]  I guarantee you it's an empty room aside from media.
[02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:21.093]  And he's bashing Trump for the COVID response, bashing white America, saying all black people are victims and oppressed, even though he's the one that was responsible for it.
[02:38:21.093 --> 02:38:24.534]  Joe Biden is the modern day leader of the KKK, which is the Democrat Party.
[02:38:25.614 --> 02:38:30.139]  So it's just incredible to see Fox News building this guy up as a real candidate.
[02:38:30.139 --> 02:38:35.143]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarsStore.com is how everything we do here is possible.
[02:38:35.143 --> 02:38:38.266]  Cannot thank you enough for your support at InfoWarsStore.com to give me a platform.
[02:38:38.266 --> 02:38:42.109]  People were shocked last night at the Republican meeting when I told them I'm banned on the Internet.
[02:38:42.109 --> 02:38:43.471]  They couldn't believe it.
[02:38:43.471 --> 02:38:50.117]  But thank God for you shopping at InfoWarsStore.com and allowing us to still have a voice, allowing us to still have impact.
[02:38:50.917 --> 02:38:57.180]  And allowing us to build Band Out Video and other sites, newswars.com, and continue our live coverage here every day.
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:01.222]  So cannot thank you, the audience, enough for supporting us at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:39:01.222 --> 02:39:04.784]  And I encourage you to take advantage of some of the specials running at the website.
[02:39:04.784 --> 02:39:07.825]  Get emergency food if you haven't yet.
[02:39:07.825 --> 02:39:08.646]  That's going to be key.
[02:39:08.646 --> 02:39:13.348]  They're building up for a second fake wave of coronavirus, so there's going to be another rush on emergency food.
[02:39:13.348 --> 02:39:16.049]  So I would get shopping and order that before it comes.
[02:39:16.049 --> 02:39:17.850]  Probably about two weeks away from that is my guess.
[02:39:17.850 --> 02:39:19.251]  Now, here's a special report from David Knight.
[02:39:19.713 --> 02:39:22.457]  I was saying before we went to break, didn't have enough time to play it then.
[02:39:22.457 --> 02:39:30.667]  About five years ago, if you remember, we had the horrific shooting, Dylann Roof, and it was unbelievably evil and hateful.
[02:39:30.667 --> 02:39:37.536]  And yet, Nikki Haley and many people at the time were using that to call for the eradication of history.
[02:39:38.462 --> 02:39:41.103]  And I said at the time, it isn't going to stop with Confederate symbols.
[02:39:41.103 --> 02:39:45.984]  It isn't going to stop by enforcing their idea of what Confederate symbols are.
[02:39:45.984 --> 02:39:52.246]  Because, you know, if you say, well, this is about the Ku Klux Klan, well, the Ku Klux Klan burns crosses, so we're going to have to get rid of crosses too.
[02:39:52.246 --> 02:39:55.307]  Oh, well, yeah, they're not essential either.
[02:39:55.307 --> 02:39:55.847]  It never ends.
[02:39:57.265 --> 02:40:03.148]  And so I want to play for you what Walter Williams said five years ago, as this is happening.
[02:40:03.148 --> 02:40:09.932]  Walter Williams, a libertarian economist who teaches at George Mason University in Washington.
[02:40:09.932 --> 02:40:14.995]  This is Walter Williams on banning the Confederate flag, a black economist, five years ago.
[02:40:14.995 --> 02:40:16.356]  Video clip number two.
[02:40:16.356 --> 02:40:20.378]  Steve in Arlington Heights, Illinois, texts in to you.
[02:40:20.378 --> 02:40:24.660]  Can you speak to the anti-Confederate hysteria currently sweeping the nation?
[02:40:26.849 --> 02:40:37.176]  Yes, I think people don't really understand much of the history of our country.
[02:40:37.176 --> 02:40:51.445]  And just very briefly, and this is on my website and my articles, and I talk about this, and that is, in 1783, there was the Treaty of Paris.
[02:40:51.445 --> 02:40:56.309]  And the Treaty of Paris ended the war between the colonies in Great Britain.
[02:40:56.849 --> 02:41:01.173]  And if you read the Treaty of Paris, it says that there are 13 sovereign nations.
[02:41:01.173 --> 02:41:04.256]  That is, each state was a nation.
[02:41:04.256 --> 02:41:14.405]  And these states came together as principles in 1787, and they created the federal government as their agent.
[02:41:15.359 --> 02:41:19.302]  And principles can always fire their agents.
[02:41:19.302 --> 02:41:39.176]  And if you read the ratification documents of Rhode Island, New York, and Virginia, they specifically say in the documents that if the federal government becomes abusive of the powers that we have delegated to the federal government, we have the right to rescind those powers.
[02:41:39.176 --> 02:41:41.638]  That is, we have the right to secede.
[02:41:43.479 --> 02:41:46.721]  So, most Americans do not understand.
[02:41:46.721 --> 02:41:57.868]  They think that the war was solely to end slavery, but the war was for much more than that.
[02:42:00.570 --> 02:42:20.019]  The winners of any war write its history, and so the Confederacy has just, you know, they've gotten really a bad name, and I think that this anti-Confederacy movement is just maybe
[02:42:21.199 --> 02:42:28.090]  One more step towards abolishing many of our symbols.
[02:42:32.901 --> 02:42:37.706]  Whether the Confederacy was right in seceding.
[02:42:37.706 --> 02:42:39.067]  And you don't have to be for slavery.
[02:42:39.067 --> 02:42:40.789]  You can be against slavery.
[02:42:40.789 --> 02:42:42.931]  But that's an independent argument.
[02:42:42.931 --> 02:42:44.913]  Did they have the right to secede?
[02:42:44.913 --> 02:42:48.737]  And all the evidence suggests, yes, they did have the right to secede.
[02:42:48.737 --> 02:42:51.460]  Because the states were principals.
[02:42:52.421 --> 02:42:55.583]  And they came together and created the federal government.
[02:42:55.583 --> 02:43:01.888]  That is, most Americans today think that, they virtually think that the states are a creation of the federal government.
[02:43:01.888 --> 02:43:07.973]  As a matter of fact, that's the way Congress acts, that the states are a creation of the federal government, but it's actually the opposite.
[02:43:09.039 --> 02:43:10.240]  That's right.
[02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:24.910]  And what the founders of this country, who, listen to Walter Williams, he's exactly right, 1783, the Treaty of Paris, that ended the war with Great Britain, and in that, you could see that the colonies were treated as sovereign states.
[02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:28.433]  You know, we talk about various heads of state.
[02:43:28.433 --> 02:43:34.637]  That means people who were head of Germany, or France, or the UK, or the United States.
[02:43:34.637 --> 02:43:36.479]  And prior to the Civil War,
[02:43:37.588 --> 02:43:42.872]  It was always the United States are, after the Civil War became United States is.
[02:43:42.872 --> 02:43:49.376]  It became a consolidated entity, which was anathema to the people who had fought for their freedom.
[02:43:49.376 --> 02:43:54.620]  They did not want to have a top-down pyramid structure of power.
[02:43:54.620 --> 02:44:02.726]  That's why they divided the federal government into three competing power centers, which now don't compete against each other anymore.
[02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:09.382]  And it's why they reserved power to the states and to the people.
[02:44:09.382 --> 02:44:11.162]  We're not talking about states' rights.
[02:44:11.162 --> 02:44:12.462]  States don't have rights.
[02:44:12.462 --> 02:44:13.863]  Individuals have rights.
[02:44:13.863 --> 02:44:16.804]  States had power.
[02:44:16.804 --> 02:44:20.945]  And they wanted the states to have power to keep that consolidation from happening.
[02:44:20.945 --> 02:44:29.387]  You know, as Walter Williams was talking about that 1783 treaty, they operated before they had the Constitution under Articles of Confederation.
[02:44:30.913 --> 02:44:36.019]  You see, after the revolution, America was a confederacy.
[02:44:36.019 --> 02:44:42.746]  A confederacy and not a union, because a union implies a tighter control.
[02:44:42.746 --> 02:44:45.489]  They did not want to have that, initially.
[02:44:45.489 --> 02:44:52.817]  And even after they went to a union, it was no more of a union than the United Nations is.
[02:44:54.121 --> 02:44:58.743]  Then let me ask you, you know, we are one of the many different states that created the United Nations.
[02:44:58.743 --> 02:45:05.365]  If the United Nations, you know, President Trump said, yeah, we're going to leave the WHO, we're not going to pay them any money anymore.
[02:45:05.365 --> 02:45:06.246]  I applaud that.
[02:45:06.246 --> 02:45:08.126]  That's excellent.
[02:45:08.126 --> 02:45:11.168]  I hope that that really does happen.
[02:45:11.168 --> 02:45:19.731]  But if President Trump were to do something else that I would like to see happen, and if he were to say, we're going to leave the United Nations as well.
[02:45:21.534 --> 02:45:27.816]  And we'd like for the United Nations to relocate their headquarters somewhere else.
[02:45:27.816 --> 02:45:35.919]  If President Trump were to do that, and if you were to have the other countries in the United Nations say, how dare you!
[02:45:35.919 --> 02:45:37.880]  You cannot leave the United Nations!
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:39.681]  You are subordinate to the United Nations!
[02:45:39.681 --> 02:45:42.262]  And what if they were to raise a massive army
[02:45:43.490 --> 02:45:49.214]  For the purpose of invading America and forcing us to remain in the United Nations.
[02:45:49.214 --> 02:45:52.296]  Would we be justified in defending ourselves?
[02:45:52.296 --> 02:45:54.978]  Because that's how it happened.
[02:45:54.978 --> 02:45:57.900]  With the War of Northern Aggression.
[02:45:57.900 --> 02:45:59.281]  That's exactly how it happened.
[02:45:59.281 --> 02:46:06.747]  You know, my wife is from New York, and as I was explaining the Civil War to her, somebody who grew up in the South,
[02:46:08.883 --> 02:46:11.204]  I was more familiar with the history than she was.
[02:46:11.204 --> 02:46:17.667]  She was familiar with the history that had been written by the Grand Army of the Republic, the winners who write history, as Walter Williams pointed out.
[02:46:17.667 --> 02:46:19.808]  You know, we have Marxists who erase history.
[02:46:19.808 --> 02:46:22.430]  That's what is happening right now.
[02:46:22.430 --> 02:46:26.051]  The winners write history, the Marxists erase history.
[02:46:26.051 --> 02:46:31.834]  Because they have to erase the culture and the society so they can take it over from the ground up.
[02:46:31.834 --> 02:46:36.796]  But as I was explaining that to her, I said, I used that same exact analogy 45 years ago.
[02:46:39.631 --> 02:46:54.121]  And I said, I can imagine, I said, think about the United Nations, what if we were to have a situation, because already at that point in time you had the radical environmentalists whining about automobile emissions and how it's going to damage, we've got to do this for the global economy and so forth.
[02:46:54.121 --> 02:47:00.186]  And I said, what if these people decided that they were going to ban internal combustion engines?
[02:47:01.499 --> 02:47:04.441]  And what if we in America said, no, I don't think so.
[02:47:04.441 --> 02:47:06.523]  We're going to continue along doing what we've been doing.
[02:47:06.523 --> 02:47:10.665]  We're going to have our cars, we're going to have our factories to produce electricity so we can manufacture.
[02:47:10.665 --> 02:47:18.031]  Because at that time, we were using the most energy of anybody and we were creating the most pollution because we were doing most of the manufacturing.
[02:47:18.031 --> 02:47:22.974]  Now that has gone to China and they make no efforts in China to control their emissions.
[02:47:22.974 --> 02:47:25.496]  But I said, let's say that America said, no, we're not going to go along with that.
[02:47:26.445 --> 02:47:32.848]  And let's say the globalists, the UN, decided that they were going to force us to do that.
[02:47:32.848 --> 02:47:33.968]  And they were going to attack us.
[02:47:33.968 --> 02:47:38.570]  You know, they were going to force us one way or the other, and we decided we wouldn't get out, and they attack us.
[02:47:38.570 --> 02:47:41.832]  I said that's exactly what happened from an economic standpoint.
[02:47:41.832 --> 02:47:45.153]  Now there was a moral standpoint that you cannot ignore.
[02:47:45.153 --> 02:47:48.755]  But these people who focus strictly on the moral issues,
[02:47:49.611 --> 02:47:50.031]  We're good to go.
[02:48:09.542 --> 02:48:15.887]  Uh, that were made by the founders of this country, by the people who seceded, said, we don't want to have a consolidated country.
[02:48:15.887 --> 02:48:20.011]  All the predictions that they made, they said, if you allow this to happen, this is what's going to happen.
[02:48:20.011 --> 02:48:27.957]  And they would not have been surprised in the least to see what the federal government has turned into in the wake of that.
[02:48:27.957 --> 02:48:28.597]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:28.597 --> 02:48:29.018]  Stay with us.
[02:48:34.482 --> 02:48:36.805]  This is the end, my friends.
[02:48:36.805 --> 02:48:38.947]  My only friend's the end.
[02:48:38.947 --> 02:48:41.510]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[02:48:41.510 --> 02:48:44.673]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[02:48:44.673 --> 02:48:45.755]  The safety.
[02:48:45.755 --> 02:48:46.355]  The delusion.
[02:48:47.287 --> 02:48:49.469]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:49.469 --> 02:48:52.672]  Because there was only the mirage of safety.
[02:48:52.672 --> 02:48:56.336]  Movies, and partying, and living like children.
[02:48:56.336 --> 02:48:58.999]  Ever growing up, ever caring about other people.
[02:48:58.999 --> 02:49:02.702]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[02:49:02.702 --> 02:49:05.665]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states.
[02:49:05.665 --> 02:49:10.750]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity.
[02:49:11.681 --> 02:49:18.704]  Because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved.
[02:49:18.704 --> 02:49:20.744]  We are repeating that again today.
[02:49:20.744 --> 02:49:26.687]  Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[02:49:26.687 --> 02:49:29.368]  Infowars has decided to fight for freedom.
[02:49:29.368 --> 02:49:32.649]  Infowars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[02:49:34.830 --> 02:49:37.270]  I was talking to my patron supplier, Great Suppliers.
[02:49:37.270 --> 02:49:40.211]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[02:49:40.211 --> 02:49:41.271]  It's the highest quality.
[02:49:41.271 --> 02:49:42.691]  They've got it.
[02:49:42.691 --> 02:49:49.092]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[02:49:49.092 --> 02:49:51.633]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[02:49:51.633 --> 02:49:54.974]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[02:49:54.974 --> 02:49:59.794]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the globalists.
[02:49:59.794 --> 02:50:03.135]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[02:50:04.381 --> 02:50:07.122]  We're going to still go down the hard road now.
[02:50:07.122 --> 02:50:13.044]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[02:50:13.044 --> 02:50:14.564]  You need to get high quality storable food.
[02:50:14.564 --> 02:50:15.765]  It's something you need.
[02:50:15.765 --> 02:50:26.769]  We have high quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast and 360Win, so please take care of your storable food needs at InfoWareStore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[02:50:26.769 --> 02:50:29.570]  It's in great containers, high quality, last 25 years.
[02:50:29.570 --> 02:50:33.571]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:50:37.839 --> 02:50:49.603]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:49.603 --> 02:50:57.106]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:50:57.106 --> 02:51:00.447]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:00.447 --> 02:51:03.708]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:18.376]  John Rappaport here, once again, talking about the operation.
[02:51:18.376 --> 02:51:29.382]  The operation to destroy America, to destroy other countries, and the concept of liberty.
[02:51:29.382 --> 02:51:35.006]  These are the times to try men's souls, sunshine, patriots,
[02:51:36.144 --> 02:51:42.868]  The words of Thomas Paine, perhaps you remember them from the Crisis No.
[02:51:42.868 --> 02:51:46.430]  1, one of his pamphlets.
[02:51:46.430 --> 02:51:51.032]  It was during the Revolutionary War.
[02:51:51.032 --> 02:51:56.455]  Washington's army was on the verge of complete collapse and defeat.
[02:51:56.455 --> 02:52:03.159]  In the winter, 11,000 troops had simply walked out and gone home.
[02:52:04.736 --> 02:52:09.099]  Contracts were ready to expire on the rest of the army.
[02:52:09.099 --> 02:52:15.404]  It was assumed that they would walk home as well.
[02:52:15.404 --> 02:52:22.689]  And so, Thomas Paine put out a second pamphlet, Crisis No.
[02:52:22.689 --> 02:52:25.771]  1, after Common Sense.
[02:52:25.771 --> 02:52:33.296]  Common Sense, of course, had done a great deal to spur on the American revolution of independence from England.
[02:52:36.573 --> 02:52:54.561]  And so several events happened that were fortunate for Washington's army, but one of the main ones was that he got a hold of Thomas Paine's pamphlet and he said, the morale of the troops needs to be boosted.
[02:52:54.561 --> 02:53:00.724]  And so I want these words of Thomas Paine to be read to the troops.
[02:53:00.724 --> 02:53:03.505]  And so they were from the pamphlet.
[02:53:03.505 --> 02:53:05.966]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[02:53:10.253 --> 02:53:14.016]  Freedom.
[02:53:14.016 --> 02:53:24.685]  And the morale of the troops was boosted and they went on to obtain victories against the Hessians, against Tao.
[02:53:24.685 --> 02:53:37.175]  The tide turned in the Revolutionary War on the whole concept of oppression, liberty, courage, willingness to go all the way.
[02:53:39.363 --> 02:53:44.667]  To fight and to die if necessary.
[02:53:44.667 --> 02:54:05.281]  In other words, there was a time in our history when what we're seeing now, the completely preposterous imprisonment of the population, the so-called lockdowns, the contact tracing, the surveillance, the testing,
[02:54:05.819 --> 02:54:26.011]  The vaccine, the whole idea of having to present some form of guarantee of immunity in order to gain access to travel, which is the plan, and to work and go to the office and all of this.
[02:54:26.011 --> 02:54:32.355]  All of that, there was a time when all of that would have been defeated overnight.
[02:54:34.380 --> 02:54:38.941]  The population of America would never have stood for it.
[02:54:38.941 --> 02:54:59.867]  They would have come out onto the roads, the streets, the farms, the fields, the city halls, wherever they needed to, en masse, by the millions, and they would have said, you're telling us we can't work?
[02:54:59.867 --> 02:55:02.248]  We can't earn a living?
[02:55:02.248 --> 02:55:03.708]  That we might be sick?
[02:55:04.835 --> 02:55:14.581]  That because we might get ill and pass some sickness on, that you're going to destroy the entire country and the entire economy?
[02:55:14.581 --> 02:55:15.001]  Really?
[02:55:15.001 --> 02:55:20.044]  It's not going to happen.
[02:55:20.044 --> 02:55:22.925]  We're not going to do it.
[02:55:22.925 --> 02:55:25.727]  And it would have been over at that point.
[02:55:25.727 --> 02:55:31.370]  Fauci would have been a simple little disgusting clown that would have been swept away in the tide.
[02:55:32.307 --> 02:55:35.213]  The coronavirus task force gone forever.
[02:55:35.213 --> 02:55:40.084]  We'll have more to say about this and about America after the break.
[02:55:40.084 --> 02:55:41.727]  John Rappaport on InfoWars.
[02:55:42.884 --> 02:55:44.545]  It's finally here!
[02:55:44.545 --> 02:55:48.646]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[02:55:48.646 --> 02:55:55.008]  Available now for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:55:55.008 --> 02:56:04.411]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive Deep Earth Crystal Nascent Iodine.
[02:56:05.211 --> 02:56:19.776]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[02:56:19.776 --> 02:56:27.839]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism, and healthy cognitive function.
[02:56:28.519 --> 02:56:36.122]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off intro pricing at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:36.122 --> 02:56:53.009]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:53.009 --> 02:56:54.590]  So as I was saying before the break,
[02:56:56.303 --> 02:57:06.509]  Make no mistake about it, even though most people don't have any sense of history left, because it's been wiped away by the schools.
[02:57:06.509 --> 02:57:14.673]  But there was a time when this entire insanity that we're facing now would have been over in one night.
[02:57:14.673 --> 02:57:22.638]  People would have come out of their houses with guns, understanding their right to defend themselves, their lives.
[02:57:23.723 --> 02:57:33.010]  Their jobs, their businesses, their their right to earn a living, their survival.
[02:57:33.010 --> 02:57:35.832]  And they would have said.
[02:57:35.832 --> 02:57:37.594]  You've gone insane.
[02:57:37.594 --> 02:57:45.140]  You're not going to produce this kind of an effect on the country, on us, on anybody.
[02:57:45.140 --> 02:57:51.865]  So not only is this not going to happen, but we're going to throw you out of office, cast you aside and bring on
[02:57:53.088 --> 02:58:20.182]  Some better people, people who understand what the spirit of liberty is all about, what freedom is all about, what we've established here on this continent in terms of limited government, which was the point of the exercise and the sacrifice and the blood and the dying, not to the creation of government, but
[02:58:21.294 --> 02:58:43.589]  With grudging willingness to frame a constitution that would create, yes, a country, a federal government, severely hamstrung with severely limited powers to interfere in the lives of the people.
[02:58:43.589 --> 02:58:45.971]  That was the point.
[02:58:45.971 --> 02:58:47.952]  And independence from England.
[02:58:50.026 --> 02:59:08.621]  And this was all going to be thrown away overnight when people could remember members of their family, their relatives, their friends, people they knew well in their communities who had shed blood and died in the War of Revolution of 1776.
[02:59:08.621 --> 02:59:14.266]  And they were going to throw all that away for Anthony Fauci?
[02:59:14.266 --> 02:59:16.447]  You kidding me?
[02:59:16.447 --> 02:59:18.429]  For Deborah Birx?
[02:59:18.429 --> 02:59:19.530]  For Robert Redfield?
[02:59:21.460 --> 02:59:35.417]  For some computer modeler from England named Neil Ferguson, with an abject record of failure, who predicted two million people would die in America because of COVID-19.
[02:59:40.014 --> 02:59:54.499]  The population of a free and brave country were going to throw away their entire revolution and what it stood for and what it meant and what it passed down to future generations and all the blood and the sacrifice simply for this?
[02:59:54.499 --> 02:59:57.560]  No.
[02:59:57.560 --> 02:59:59.360]  Never would have happened.
[02:59:59.360 --> 03:00:02.161]  But now.
[03:00:02.161 --> 03:00:06.082]  Now look.
[03:00:06.082 --> 03:00:07.883]  Look at the great city of New York.
[03:00:09.727 --> 03:00:12.528]  It's desolate.
[03:00:12.528 --> 03:00:24.854]  A friend was telling me the other day he was walking on the streets of Manhattan around the famous Flatiron Building around 23rd Street.
[03:00:24.854 --> 03:00:28.535]  I know the area well.
[03:00:28.535 --> 03:00:30.776]  Boarded up.
[03:00:30.776 --> 03:00:34.518]  Store after shop after store after store.
[03:00:34.518 --> 03:00:36.319]  Streets empty.
[03:00:37.719 --> 03:00:48.605]  Occasionally, people appearing, walking along, wearing a mask.
[03:00:48.605 --> 03:00:53.008]  This is what happened to the great city of New York.
[03:00:53.008 --> 03:01:05.755]  And the citizenry of New York, especially the business owners, the people who have a stake in earning their own way, have folded up like a house of cards that fell.
[03:01:06.730 --> 03:01:08.211]  And submitted completely.
[03:01:08.211 --> 03:01:10.612]  We surrender to the lockdowns.
[03:01:10.612 --> 03:01:21.198]  We surrender to the fascist dictator Cuomo and the little puppet dictator de Blasio.
[03:01:21.198 --> 03:01:22.939]  No courage left.
[03:01:22.939 --> 03:01:24.540]  No guts.
[03:01:24.540 --> 03:01:26.241]  No honor.
[03:01:26.241 --> 03:01:27.602]  Nothing.
[03:01:27.602 --> 03:01:29.603]  Zero.
[03:01:29.603 --> 03:01:33.645]  So it falls to the people who are willing
[03:01:35.799 --> 03:01:38.761]  To do what needs to be done.
[03:01:38.761 --> 03:01:51.029]  To overthrow this fascist tyranny that has taken over by bloodless coup the government of states and the government of the United States.
[03:01:51.029 --> 03:02:00.355]  A long time ago I wrote a piece called Anthony Fauci the Interim President of the United States and it was the case.
[03:02:00.355 --> 03:02:05.518]  He was the acting president and still in many ways is the acting president.
[03:02:06.186 --> 03:02:21.335]  This little chorp who has nothing at all except having had the capacity to worm his way up politically into a position of power.
[03:02:21.335 --> 03:02:27.198]  This has nothing to do with competence, science, any of that.
[03:02:27.797 --> 03:02:30.159]  I know the left adores Fauci.
[03:02:30.159 --> 03:02:47.974]  They think he's the counterbalance to the deranged president, the only man of common sense among us who is willing to state the facts and all of that, which is sheer, preposterous BS.
[03:02:47.974 --> 03:02:50.356]  Insanity.
[03:02:50.356 --> 03:02:55.080]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:56.501]  So I ask you this question.
[03:02:57.116 --> 03:03:00.498]  And I hope you consider it seriously.
[03:03:00.498 --> 03:03:12.185]  If you walked into a doctor's office and you're feeling all right, you go in for whatever reason, don't know why, but there you are, physical checkup, whatever.
[03:03:12.185 --> 03:03:18.509]  And the doctor says, I'm afraid that you are in terrible condition.
[03:03:18.509 --> 03:03:20.750]  Your prospects are not very good.
[03:03:20.750 --> 03:03:25.113]  In fact, you need to be put on life support immediately.
[03:03:28.180 --> 03:03:32.223]  Would it not occur to you to find a second opinion?
[03:03:32.223 --> 03:03:34.445]  At the very least.
[03:03:34.445 --> 03:03:37.427]  At the very least, a second opinion?
[03:03:37.427 --> 03:03:40.529]  Wouldn't it?
[03:03:40.529 --> 03:03:44.412]  Somebody gives a patient that kind of diagnosis?
[03:03:44.412 --> 03:03:45.432]  Of course.
[03:03:45.432 --> 03:03:48.695]  But what about the diagnosis for the country?
[03:03:48.695 --> 03:03:54.699]  Anthony Fauci gets up and gives his opinion.
[03:03:54.699 --> 03:03:56.240]  The country's on life support.
[03:03:59.082 --> 03:04:00.743]  And is there no second opinion?
[03:04:00.743 --> 03:04:03.926]  Well, as a matter of fact, there are many second opinions.
[03:04:03.926 --> 03:04:16.416]  And now I'm not even talking about the deep dive that I and other people have taken into the fabricated hoax that is the pandemic from the outset, which we'll talk about a little bit later.
[03:04:16.416 --> 03:04:27.104]  But what I'm talking about here is conventional medical scientific authorities in the United States, in Germany, in England, in other places.
[03:04:27.833 --> 03:04:37.820]  Who have in Sweden, who have stepped out and said, the lockdowns are completely insane.
[03:04:37.820 --> 03:04:43.524]  Even within the conventional view of what COVID-19 is.
[03:04:43.524 --> 03:04:44.725]  It's insane.
[03:04:44.725 --> 03:04:46.206]  It's counterproductive.
[03:04:46.206 --> 03:04:53.752]  It's destroying lives in the process and economies, of course, and putting people in severe danger.
[03:04:53.752 --> 03:04:56.694]  They're committing suicide at a higher rate, drug addiction.
[03:04:57.352 --> 03:05:05.717]  Violence, poverty, bankruptcy, hopelessness around the planet.
[03:05:05.717 --> 03:05:06.297]  For what?
[03:05:06.297 --> 03:05:09.779]  For nothing.
[03:05:09.779 --> 03:05:13.922]  And I would point you to one article by J.B.
[03:05:13.922 --> 03:05:21.106]  Handley at Children's Health Defense called Lockdown Lunacy, A Thinking Person's Guide.
[03:05:21.106 --> 03:05:23.788]  And the reason that I do that, and there it is on the screen,
[03:05:24.489 --> 03:05:53.392]  is because what Handley does is all right taking the somewhat conventional approach all right there is a virus there are tests there are numbers of cases etc etc let's look at what other medical authorities besides Fauci and his minions have to say about all of this and when we do and Handley cites many such studies and authorities we see the entire
[03:05:54.366 --> 03:05:57.949]  Operation is insane.
[03:05:57.949 --> 03:05:59.891]  Psychotic.
[03:05:59.891 --> 03:06:02.453]  Psychopathic.
[03:06:02.453 --> 03:06:03.373]  Deranged.
[03:06:03.373 --> 03:06:04.494]  Criminal.
[03:06:04.494 --> 03:06:08.858]  Murderous.
[03:06:08.858 --> 03:06:13.982]  A second opinion.
[03:06:13.982 --> 03:06:20.167]  Wouldn't you think the Prime Minister of a country or the President of a country would pause for that?
[03:06:20.828 --> 03:06:35.581]  And say, well, I understand what you're saying, Dr. Fauci or Dr. Ferguson, but we're going to consult a second opinion here before we knock down and lock down the whole friggin country and destroy everybody's lives.
[03:06:35.581 --> 03:06:38.003]  And there was a time when this would not have stood.
[03:06:38.971 --> 03:06:40.252]  See you after the break.
[03:06:40.252 --> 03:06:40.912]  Stay with us.

[03:08:44.063 --> 03:08:46.685]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:03.014 --> 03:09:05.675]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:09:05.675 --> 03:09:07.976]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:07.976 --> 03:09:16.080]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:09:16.080 --> 03:09:18.160]  Alright.
[03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:26.384]  The solution... No tracing, no testing, no vaccine.
[03:09:26.384 --> 03:09:27.965]  No thank you.
[03:09:27.965 --> 03:09:29.486]  Will not take it.
[03:09:29.486 --> 03:09:30.386]  Will not do it.
[03:09:30.987 --> 03:09:34.428]  Will not submit.
[03:09:34.428 --> 03:09:40.649]  People that own businesses come out of the house, open up the businesses.
[03:09:40.649 --> 03:09:44.149]  Many, many, many people.
[03:09:44.149 --> 03:09:52.091]  More than these petty tin pot governors are permitting.
[03:09:52.091 --> 03:09:56.812]  So many, in fact, that it can't be stopped.
[03:09:56.812 --> 03:09:57.912]  We're never going back.
[03:09:58.493 --> 03:10:01.635]  Never doing another lockdown, no matter what.
[03:10:01.635 --> 03:10:04.577]  Opening up.
[03:10:04.577 --> 03:10:09.059]  Beyond what's permitted.
[03:10:09.059 --> 03:10:12.722]  By these lunatics.
[03:10:12.722 --> 03:10:14.022]  No app.
[03:10:14.022 --> 03:10:16.684]  No contact tracing app.
[03:10:16.684 --> 03:10:17.985]  No tracing.
[03:10:17.985 --> 03:10:20.346]  No cooperation with tracing.
[03:10:20.346 --> 03:10:22.448]  No cooperation with testing.
[03:10:22.448 --> 03:10:25.830]  No cooperation with vaccine.
[03:10:25.830 --> 03:10:26.450]  Opening up.
[03:10:27.199 --> 03:10:37.365]  The economy coming out of the house and saying, no, this is not happening anymore.
[03:10:37.365 --> 03:10:45.910]  If enough people do that, it's all over.
[03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:46.970]  You have another answer?
[03:10:46.970 --> 03:10:55.175]  A ship from another planet is coming to, you know, redo everything and put a rainbow in
[03:10:56.112 --> 03:10:59.434]  Fauci's brain and then it'll be all over?
[03:10:59.434 --> 03:11:01.816]  I don't think so.
[03:11:01.816 --> 03:11:05.878]  I don't think so.
[03:11:05.878 --> 03:11:09.740]  And now we have the second wave.
[03:11:09.740 --> 03:11:14.143]  Man, I have a language barrier here when I get rolling.
[03:11:14.143 --> 03:11:15.704]  I have to understand that.
[03:11:15.704 --> 03:11:21.968]  There's a great deal of restraint in the language that I'm using because otherwise I would go off completely.
[03:11:24.685 --> 03:11:30.069]  And say things that are apparently are not permitted in the public airwaves.
[03:11:30.069 --> 03:11:33.652]  But anyway.
[03:11:33.652 --> 03:11:34.312]  Here we are.
[03:11:34.312 --> 03:11:38.415]  The second wave now.
[03:11:38.415 --> 03:11:44.760]  Fauci is telling Major League Baseball, does he want to be the commissioner, the next commissioner?
[03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:52.306]  Oh, you know, if you have a season, it should end in October because next winter we could have more of this.
[03:11:52.306 --> 03:11:53.967]  Thanks, Fauci.
[03:11:57.222 --> 03:11:58.383]  China?
[03:11:58.383 --> 03:11:59.684]  Are you kidding me?
[03:11:59.684 --> 03:12:02.867]  China is now locking down what part of Beijing?
[03:12:02.867 --> 03:12:05.870]  The second wave of cases?
[03:12:05.870 --> 03:12:08.673]  What happened the first time in China?
[03:12:08.673 --> 03:12:11.075]  Let's get into a little history.
[03:12:11.075 --> 03:12:17.721]  The two major events that started this entire planned operation, okay?
[03:12:17.721 --> 03:12:21.805]  Not spontaneous, not at all.
[03:12:21.805 --> 03:12:22.806]  The first was
[03:12:24.324 --> 03:12:29.209]  China locking down 50 million citizens overnight in three cities.
[03:12:29.209 --> 03:12:33.353]  That expanded to 100 million very quickly.
[03:12:33.353 --> 03:12:44.305]  And that gave the signal, which was not spontaneous, but there it was, to the CDC, the World Health Organization, and the governments around the world.
[03:12:44.305 --> 03:12:46.267]  Oh, okay!
[03:12:47.916 --> 03:12:52.398]  We can lock down too, because China just broke the ice.
[03:12:52.398 --> 03:12:57.220]  This is what we've been trying to do with every dud friggin epidemic since the beginning.
[03:12:57.220 --> 03:13:05.963]  Since SARS, since West Nile, since Ebola, since Zika, since swine flu, etc, etc, right?
[03:13:05.963 --> 03:13:09.044]  And we didn't bring it off, but now China has done it.
[03:13:09.044 --> 03:13:11.345]  And the UN and World Health Organization.
[03:13:11.345 --> 03:13:12.966]  Oh, we love China.
[03:13:12.966 --> 03:13:13.926]  Aren't they wonderful?
[03:13:13.926 --> 03:13:15.107]  They showed us the way.
[03:13:15.925 --> 03:13:17.786]  This is what we want.
[03:13:17.786 --> 03:13:19.547]  Rockefeller loves China.
[03:13:19.547 --> 03:13:24.609]  He praised China to the skies in 1973.
[03:13:24.609 --> 03:13:30.832]  They only killed, what was it, 45, 60 billion people in order to bring about Mao's revolution.
[03:13:30.832 --> 03:13:31.912]  Isn't that wonderful?
[03:13:31.912 --> 03:13:34.714]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:13:34.714 --> 03:13:40.036]  And now other countries can institute these lockdowns.
[03:13:40.036 --> 03:13:41.037]  And then what happened?
[03:13:41.037 --> 03:13:43.318]  Italy, the first beachhead on
[03:13:44.987 --> 03:13:48.050]  Uh, the Western Shore, so to speak.
[03:13:48.050 --> 03:13:48.690]  Lockdown.
[03:13:48.690 --> 03:13:49.511]  Half the country.
[03:13:49.511 --> 03:13:52.553]  Lockdown the whole country.
[03:13:52.553 --> 03:13:59.979]  Heads of the provinces in Italy at the time the first lockdown occurred didn't even know it was going to happen.
[03:13:59.979 --> 03:14:01.961]  Central government announced it overnight.
[03:14:01.961 --> 03:14:05.764]  Bang, bang, bang.
[03:14:05.764 --> 03:14:10.067]  And then, like dominoes, it began to fall.
[03:14:10.067 --> 03:14:12.770]  But then something else was needed.
[03:14:12.770 --> 03:14:13.750]  Okay?
[03:14:13.750 --> 03:14:14.451]  A prediction.
[03:14:15.245 --> 03:14:30.248]  A threat, an ominous cloud had to appear over the stupid, stupid, clueless, lunatic heads of government of nations around the world.
[03:14:30.248 --> 03:14:36.329]  A prediction of how many deaths could occur from COVID-19.
[03:14:36.329 --> 03:14:42.630]  And for that they had a criminal idiot named Neil Ferguson who worked at the Imperial College in London.
[03:14:44.531 --> 03:14:52.177]  His institute, Ferguson's, is supported by tens of millions of dollars every year from guess who?
[03:14:52.177 --> 03:14:55.200]  Bill Gates, of course, of course, of course.
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:58.843]  And so, Ferguson came up with the model.
[03:14:58.843 --> 03:15:04.227]  And this was months ago, and he said, could be 500,000 deaths in England and 2 million in the US.
[03:15:10.373 --> 03:15:19.479]  The man had an abysmal record of failure as a computer modeler, in part because the whole field is BS from the ground up.
[03:15:20.407 --> 03:15:23.609]  And the people in his own field who said, Oh, Neil is great.
[03:15:23.609 --> 03:15:24.629]  We love Ferguson.
[03:15:24.629 --> 03:15:26.330]  He's a genius and so forth.
[03:15:26.330 --> 03:15:32.553]  They're patting themselves on the back because they want a job because they're in a field that's completely unscientific.
[03:15:32.553 --> 03:15:33.954]  Oh, computer predictions.
[03:15:33.954 --> 03:15:34.954]  Yes.
[03:15:34.954 --> 03:15:38.036]  And we're pulling down a paycheck and we have a university job.
[03:15:38.036 --> 03:15:47.460]  So we have to pump up our profession and we choose to elevate Neil Schmuck Ferguson to the top of the list and say that he's a genius.
[03:15:47.460 --> 03:15:48.881]  No, he's a total failure.
[03:15:49.421 --> 03:15:50.842]  A friggin' failure!
[03:15:50.842 --> 03:16:04.754]  In 2005, he said that bird flu could kill as many as 200 million people, and the final official tally was several hundred.
[03:16:04.754 --> 03:16:13.202]  And he used the same old-time structural model that he used in 2005 to predict the COVID-19 deaths in 2020.
[03:16:18.629 --> 03:16:22.910]  But nobody bothered to figure that out or ask any questions.
[03:16:22.910 --> 03:16:25.671]  Fauci said to Trump, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:16:25.671 --> 03:16:28.991]  And somebody said to Boris Johnson, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:16:28.991 --> 03:16:34.072]  And before you know it, it's like, well, I don't want to be responsible for all these deaths.
[03:16:34.072 --> 03:16:45.475]  So the whole idea of just letting this go like an ordinary flu season and working our way through it and keeping the world alive and the economies alive is now verboten.
[03:16:45.871 --> 03:16:47.152]  It's off the table.
[03:16:47.152 --> 03:16:50.294]  We can't do it because too many people would die.
[03:16:50.294 --> 03:16:52.475]  So we have to have lockdowns.
[03:16:52.475 --> 03:16:54.036]  Listen up, you governors.
[03:16:54.036 --> 03:16:55.818]  We want you to do this.
[03:16:55.818 --> 03:16:57.779]  And that's how it happened.
[03:16:57.779 --> 03:17:05.204]  And so this potato head, Ferguson, slunk off eventually by having exposed
[03:17:06.152 --> 03:17:15.954]  I think himself to the fact that he was having an ongoing affair with a married woman who was his mistress, and she came to visit him during the lockdown.
[03:17:15.954 --> 03:17:18.435]  Oh, he apologized mea culpa.
[03:17:18.435 --> 03:17:21.196]  I broke my own rules, so to speak.
[03:17:21.196 --> 03:17:27.517]  And he disappeared and said he was quitting his official government job.
[03:17:27.517 --> 03:17:30.758]  That's called pleading to a lesser charge.
[03:17:33.055 --> 03:17:38.800]  No, I'm not guilty of making a prediction that all kinds of people are going to die and destroying the economy.
[03:17:38.800 --> 03:17:41.562]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup.
[03:17:41.562 --> 03:17:42.703]  My second cup of the day.
[03:17:42.703 --> 03:17:43.583]  It's really strong.
[03:17:43.583 --> 03:17:48.327]  I shouldn't do this because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy and the coffee has to
[03:17:48.667 --> 03:17:48.988]  Mmm.
[03:17:48.988 --> 03:17:50.690]  Wake Up America Coffee there by Love's.
[03:17:50.690 --> 03:17:52.532]  Highest-rated in the Chiapas Mountains.
[03:17:52.532 --> 03:17:54.754]  It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[03:17:54.754 --> 03:17:55.775]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[03:17:55.775 --> 03:17:58.338]  It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests.
[03:17:58.338 --> 03:17:59.279]  Hand-selected.
[03:17:59.279 --> 03:18:00.220]  It's beyond organic.
[03:18:00.220 --> 03:18:01.061]  Wild-crafted.
[03:18:01.061 --> 03:18:02.583]  Wake Up America Coffee.
[03:18:02.583 --> 03:18:03.945]  People are blown away by how good it is.
[03:18:03.945 --> 03:18:08.350]  Same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same size container.
[03:18:08.350 --> 03:18:09.411]  Yes, folks, we've been selling
[03:18:09.411 --> 03:18:10.372]  Only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[03:18:10.372 --> 03:18:10.892]  It's not as popular.
[03:18:36.224 --> 03:18:39.225]  Anyways, it's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:39.225 --> 03:18:49.148]  What InfoWars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[03:18:49.148 --> 03:18:53.009]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[03:18:53.009 --> 03:18:59.611]  And now, open world government is being established with an endgame to depopulate the planet.
[03:19:00.331 --> 03:19:05.734]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[03:19:05.734 --> 03:19:08.335]  You must decide which side you're on.
[03:19:08.335 --> 03:19:17.280]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[03:19:17.280 --> 03:19:21.823]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[03:19:21.823 --> 03:19:23.384]  The delusions must end now.
[03:19:24.344 --> 03:19:29.753]  InfoWars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[03:19:29.753 --> 03:19:33.679]  Most people that are aware of the New World Order decide to join it out of fear.
[03:19:33.679 --> 03:19:35.021]  They are truly fools.
[03:19:35.021 --> 03:19:37.445]  We must fight this, or lose our souls.
[03:19:38.453 --> 03:19:42.497]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[03:19:42.497 --> 03:19:44.079]  The first of its kind.
[03:19:44.079 --> 03:19:49.044]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[03:19:49.044 --> 03:19:52.047]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[03:19:52.047 --> 03:19:55.151]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[03:19:55.151 --> 03:19:58.534]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[03:19:58.534 --> 03:20:00.777]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[03:20:01.297 --> 03:20:03.539]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[03:20:03.539 --> 03:20:05.520]  It's great to keep with you.
[03:20:05.520 --> 03:20:11.804]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[03:20:11.804 --> 03:20:13.505]  We're really excited about it.
[03:20:13.505 --> 03:20:15.487]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[03:20:15.487 --> 03:20:26.995]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[03:20:27.455 --> 03:20:41.667]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[03:20:41.667 --> 03:20:44.269]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:58.391 --> 03:21:16.983]  All right, so the two main events that promoted this entire COVID-19 farce, false pandemic, the Chinese lockdowns, the computer predictions of Neil Ferguson.
[03:21:16.983 --> 03:21:23.086]  Now China's doing it again, locking down.
[03:21:23.086 --> 03:21:24.447]  Just think about this.
[03:21:24.447 --> 03:21:27.269]  China locks down 100 million people the first time.
[03:21:30.279 --> 03:21:37.983]  A mere two months to three months later, China is announcing that everything's been put back together in China.
[03:21:37.983 --> 03:21:39.684]  Everything's okay.
[03:21:39.684 --> 03:21:42.486]  Everybody's going back to work.
[03:21:42.486 --> 03:21:50.331]  And all of a sudden, what China was doing is happening in the West.
[03:21:50.331 --> 03:21:52.852]  All these other countries are locked down.
[03:21:52.852 --> 03:21:57.635]  China is not locked down anymore.
[03:21:57.635 --> 03:21:57.875]  Boom!
[03:21:59.861 --> 03:22:01.822]  It's like a stage magic trick.
[03:22:01.822 --> 03:22:02.462]  Here they are.
[03:22:02.462 --> 03:22:03.203]  No, they're not.
[03:22:03.203 --> 03:22:03.963]  They're over here.
[03:22:03.963 --> 03:22:05.424]  The lockdowns were there.
[03:22:05.424 --> 03:22:06.364]  Now, guess what?
[03:22:06.364 --> 03:22:10.206]  Hey, they're over here.
[03:22:10.206 --> 03:22:12.007]  And don't you know?
[03:22:12.007 --> 03:22:12.987]  You should.
[03:22:12.987 --> 03:22:16.549]  What an inspiration it was, as I said before the last break.
[03:22:17.193 --> 03:22:41.568]  For China to have done that first gigantic lockdown because all the powers that be from Bill Gates to World Health Organization etc etc were rubbing their hands because that's what they wanted to do and the UN wanted it and it was done in all these countries after China set the bar and showed the way.
[03:22:41.568 --> 03:22:46.191]  Amazing isn't it how that trick happened and now China's doing it again
[03:22:46.795 --> 03:22:52.118]  Locking down and again we hear talk of the second wave of COVID-19.
[03:22:52.118 --> 03:22:53.919]  There is no second wave.
[03:22:53.919 --> 03:22:56.741]  There was no first wave.
[03:22:56.741 --> 03:23:00.743]  The whole thing is a fraud.
[03:23:00.743 --> 03:23:09.028]  But they're going to try to piggyback on what China is doing now to lock down again.
[03:23:09.028 --> 03:23:13.451]  More than is currently being locked down.
[03:23:13.451 --> 03:23:15.892]  This country and other countries all around the world
[03:23:16.388 --> 03:23:18.768]  It's happening, believe me.
[03:23:18.768 --> 03:23:20.189]  It's happening.
[03:23:20.189 --> 03:23:23.129]  That's what they're trying to do.
[03:23:23.129 --> 03:23:26.770]  That's what they want to do.
[03:23:26.770 --> 03:23:42.393]  Do you see any of these current protests across America even vaguely approaching the medical holocaust that's going on here?
[03:23:42.393 --> 03:23:43.713]  Any possible
[03:23:44.833 --> 03:23:47.954]  Rub up against that, of course not.
[03:23:47.954 --> 03:23:50.876]  Clueless, completely.
[03:23:50.876 --> 03:23:57.598]  You want to see some horrendous things that are being done to people of color?
[03:23:57.598 --> 03:24:04.601]  Go look at some of these hospitals where the treatment is unbelievable.
[03:24:04.601 --> 03:24:11.004]  Last week I talked about the treatment in Elmhurst at the epicenter of the epicenter.
[03:24:12.549 --> 03:24:14.129]  You've got doctors in New York.
[03:24:14.129 --> 03:24:20.491]  You've got doctors in other places who are saying, well, we're just learning about the use of ventilators.
[03:24:20.491 --> 03:24:23.232]  We didn't really know how to do it before.
[03:24:23.232 --> 03:24:27.773]  And maybe some of these people don't need ventilators.
[03:24:27.773 --> 03:24:29.534]  And it's a learning process.
[03:24:29.534 --> 03:24:38.736]  Of course, if people are dying like flies, when we put them on ventilators and when we give them all kinds of heavy sedatives so they fall asleep,
[03:24:39.489 --> 03:24:45.891]  Under the ventilation and they never wake up?
[03:24:45.891 --> 03:24:52.832]  Yeah, but we don't want to talk about that because we're on a learning curve, you see, we doctors.
[03:24:52.832 --> 03:25:06.936]  We didn't know that one of the long-standing adverse effects of the use of ventilators is pneumonia in patients who are already supposedly suffering from lung conditions called COVID.
[03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:13.794]  We didn't know that too much pressure on the lungs could destroy the lungs.
[03:25:13.794 --> 03:25:14.235]  Really?
[03:25:14.235 --> 03:25:23.782]  That's like saying, we didn't know if you took a hammer and you smash somebody on the head that we could cause any damage.
[03:25:23.782 --> 03:25:26.004]  We didn't know, we're just learning.
[03:25:26.004 --> 03:25:34.411]  We didn't realize that you could give people who have shortness of breath that need oxygen, other means of oxygen.
[03:25:34.411 --> 03:25:37.053]  Never heard of other ways of delivering oxygen?
[03:25:37.469 --> 03:25:40.331]  Been through a ventilator?
[03:25:40.331 --> 03:25:42.313]  Really?
[03:25:42.313 --> 03:25:46.636]  You want to see some horrendous things going on?
[03:25:46.636 --> 03:26:03.310]  In New York City, in New York State, where Governor Cuomo, who's all of a sudden a genius doctor, demands 30,000 ventilators be sent to New York to treat these patients.
[03:26:05.984 --> 03:26:07.084]  What does he know?
[03:26:07.084 --> 03:26:07.984]  He's a moron.
[03:26:07.984 --> 03:26:10.245]  He knows nothing.
[03:26:10.245 --> 03:26:11.625]  He's a potato head.
[03:26:11.625 --> 03:26:21.227]  And if his name weren't Cuomo, he'd be shoveling sand in Death Valley, where he belongs.
[03:26:21.227 --> 03:26:25.948]  Ditto for de Blasio, the mayor of New York.
[03:26:25.948 --> 03:26:32.129]  They don't know anything about medicine or science.
[03:26:32.129 --> 03:26:33.890]  They're fascists.
[03:26:33.890 --> 03:26:34.610]  That's what they are.
[03:26:35.708 --> 03:26:37.991]  There's Daddy Mario Kompot.
[03:26:37.991 --> 03:26:42.878]  Yeah.
[03:26:42.878 --> 03:26:44.300]  So this is what's going on.
[03:26:49.051 --> 03:26:58.453]  At the very beginning, going back to the so-called discovery of the new virus that nobody has seen before, which they over-discovered in about five minutes.
[03:26:58.453 --> 03:27:03.514]  Well, we had an outbreak in Wuhan and Wuwu, and the scientists said, what is this?
[03:27:03.514 --> 03:27:04.634]  We don't know.
[03:27:04.634 --> 03:27:08.815]  We've got patients coming in with lung problems and pneumonia and whatever.
[03:27:08.815 --> 03:27:15.376]  Of course, 300,000 people every year die of pneumonia in China, which means they have millions of cases of pneumonia.
[03:27:15.376 --> 03:27:16.276]  But we'll ignore that.
[03:27:17.054 --> 03:27:17.694]  Yeah.
[03:27:17.694 --> 03:27:18.115]  Hmm.
[03:27:18.115 --> 03:27:19.215]  Yeah, this is serious.
[03:27:19.215 --> 03:27:23.698]  I wonder if it's going to be a new disease here.
[03:27:23.698 --> 03:27:24.778]  The Chinese researcher.
[03:27:24.778 --> 03:27:31.241]  Well, we better call in the CDC and the World Health Organization, big shot virus hunters to help us out here and whatever.
[03:27:31.241 --> 03:27:35.123]  And here they are working away for 10 minutes in the lab.
[03:27:35.123 --> 03:27:43.048]  And, you know, somebody would come in the room and tap them on the shoulder and say, hey, schmuck, look out the window of the building.
[03:27:43.048 --> 03:27:43.648]  What do you see?
[03:27:44.884 --> 03:27:45.945]  Well, I don't see anything.
[03:27:45.945 --> 03:27:46.605]  That's right.
[03:27:46.605 --> 03:27:48.126]  You don't see anything.
[03:27:48.126 --> 03:28:02.696]  You can't see across the street because the foul air has such deadly pollutants in it that people took to the streets last summer to protest it, even though protests in China could get you arrested and disappeared and killed.
[03:28:02.696 --> 03:28:07.279]  And you want to know what's causing lung problems in Wuhan?
[03:28:07.279 --> 03:28:09.580]  And you're looking for a virus?
[03:28:09.580 --> 03:28:10.741]  Really?
[03:28:10.741 --> 03:28:11.942]  Isn't that wonderful?
[03:28:12.566 --> 03:28:16.689]  And I bet you're going to find this new virus in about 10 minutes, right?
[03:28:16.689 --> 03:28:18.191]  Yeah, how did you know?
[03:28:18.191 --> 03:28:30.060]  It's called, let's call it COV2 SARS COVID-19 and give it a nice fancy name and say nobody ever saw it before.
[03:28:30.060 --> 03:28:40.829]  Do a study on patients, line up 500 or 1,000 that are supposed to have this epidemic and confirm by some real test, not a fake test.
[03:28:41.368 --> 03:28:45.051]  That they all have this new virus that we never saw before?
[03:28:45.051 --> 03:28:46.672]  No, we're not going to do that.
[03:28:46.672 --> 03:28:54.118]  We're just going to pick out anecdotally a few people here and there and say, oh, we sequenced the whole thing and the genetic blah, blah, blah.
[03:28:54.118 --> 03:28:57.240]  And we got the new virus and everybody agrees.
[03:28:57.240 --> 03:28:59.022]  And it's an epidemic and it's spreading.
[03:28:59.022 --> 03:29:02.264]  And look, Beijing just locked down 50 million people.
[03:29:02.264 --> 03:29:03.665]  Whoa, OK.
[03:29:03.665 --> 03:29:04.566]  Italy, you're next.
[03:29:05.531 --> 03:29:07.712]  Neil Ferguson, get to work.
[03:29:07.712 --> 03:29:10.393]  Okay, give us the computer prediction.
[03:29:10.393 --> 03:29:13.694]  All right, lockdown the UK, lockdown America.
[03:29:13.694 --> 03:29:17.395]  Don't come out of your houses.
[03:29:17.395 --> 03:29:21.016]  Don't be a patriot.
[03:29:21.016 --> 03:29:26.899]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[03:29:26.899 --> 03:29:29.820]  No, we can't have that.
[03:29:29.820 --> 03:29:33.921]  No, this can't be a time that tries anybody's souls.
[03:29:35.171 --> 03:29:36.232]  Hey, we got McDonald's.
[03:29:36.232 --> 03:29:38.653]  We got TV.
[03:29:38.653 --> 03:29:39.573]  We got internet.
[03:29:39.573 --> 03:29:42.455]  We got video games.
[03:29:42.455 --> 03:29:47.257]  How can there be any trying of the soul?
[03:29:47.257 --> 03:29:51.999]  We got a million things we can order from Walmart, online, and Amazon.
[03:29:51.999 --> 03:29:56.721]  Hey, you know, Amazon is forever, baby.
[03:29:56.721 --> 03:30:00.423]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[03:30:00.423 --> 03:30:03.284]  The Summer Soldier.
[03:30:03.284 --> 03:30:04.405]  Sunshine Patriot.
[03:30:10.840 --> 03:30:18.644]  Is this country just going to be allowing itself to be flushed down the toilet?
[03:30:18.644 --> 03:30:19.525]  Say that's the end?
[03:30:19.525 --> 03:30:22.186]  We're finished?
[03:30:22.186 --> 03:30:24.207]  We bow to the medical dictatorship.
[03:30:24.207 --> 03:30:26.228]  Whatever they say we do.
[03:30:26.228 --> 03:30:27.509]  Wear a mask.
[03:30:27.509 --> 03:30:28.950]  Cover your head.
[03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:30.491]  Hide in the bathroom.
[03:30:30.491 --> 03:30:33.953]  Lock the door.
[03:30:33.953 --> 03:30:34.913]  Go to the hospital.
[03:30:34.913 --> 03:30:36.094]  Don't go to the hospital.
[03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:39.010]  It's finally here.
[03:30:39.010 --> 03:30:43.852]  Introducing the first of its kind nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[03:30:43.852 --> 03:30:50.475]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[03:30:50.475 --> 03:30:52.516]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[03:30:52.516 --> 03:31:01.319]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[03:31:01.599 --> 03:31:08.101]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[03:31:08.101 --> 03:31:09.681]  I can personally feel the difference.
[03:31:09.681 --> 03:31:17.803]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[03:31:17.803 --> 03:31:22.624]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[03:31:22.624 --> 03:31:27.445]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of truthnascent iodine today.
[03:31:27.645 --> 03:31:35.100]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[03:31:35.100 --> 03:31:36.602]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:43.689 --> 03:31:55.678]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[03:31:55.678 --> 03:31:58.881]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[03:31:58.881 --> 03:32:05.126]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[03:32:05.626 --> 03:32:10.950]  It's gonna be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[03:32:10.950 --> 03:32:13.411]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[03:32:13.411 --> 03:32:24.839]  That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[03:32:24.839 --> 03:32:29.042]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[03:32:29.042 --> 03:32:32.884]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[03:32:39.251 --> 03:32:47.443]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[03:32:48.720 --> 03:32:53.443]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[03:32:53.443 --> 03:32:55.804]  Super Male Vitality!
[03:32:55.804 --> 03:33:04.670]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[03:33:04.670 --> 03:33:15.517]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[03:33:15.797 --> 03:33:16.477]  Yes.
[03:33:16.477 --> 03:33:21.398]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[03:33:21.398 --> 03:33:28.320]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[03:33:28.320 --> 03:33:29.380]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:33:29.380 --> 03:33:31.220]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[03:33:31.220 --> 03:33:34.041]  Never been a better time than right now.
[03:33:34.041 --> 03:33:37.542]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:33:38.582 --> 03:33:40.946]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[03:33:40.946 --> 03:33:46.915]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[03:33:46.915 --> 03:33:50.841]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[03:33:52.014 --> 03:33:53.655]  That is amazing.
[03:33:53.655 --> 03:34:01.339]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[03:34:01.339 --> 03:34:03.660]  And there's another innovation.
[03:34:03.660 --> 03:34:05.741]  It's the spray cap.
[03:34:05.741 --> 03:34:11.144]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[03:34:11.144 --> 03:34:13.325]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[03:34:13.325 --> 03:34:14.246]  I like to put it on my hands.
[03:34:14.986 --> 03:34:16.487]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[03:34:16.487 --> 03:34:19.288]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes.
[03:34:19.288 --> 03:34:23.710]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[03:34:23.710 --> 03:34:25.550]  So, this is a real innovation.
[03:34:25.550 --> 03:34:31.873]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[03:34:31.873 --> 03:34:33.373]  It smells great.
[03:34:33.373 --> 03:34:35.194]  It's so refreshing.
[03:34:35.194 --> 03:34:41.697]  This is a big winner.
[03:34:41.697 --> 03:34:44.298]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:58.345 --> 03:35:02.748]  So how do you think China is looking at the U.S.
[03:35:02.748 --> 03:35:03.729]  right now?
[03:35:03.729 --> 03:35:07.532]  Chinese government, I'm talking about the regime.
[03:35:07.532 --> 03:35:09.554]  Think they're feeling any sympathy?
[03:35:09.554 --> 03:35:11.996]  Kidding?
[03:35:11.996 --> 03:35:19.562]  Oh, well, we locked down 100 million people the first time and look what happened in the U.S.
[03:35:19.562 --> 03:35:21.383]  So they locked down everybody.
[03:35:21.383 --> 03:35:22.584]  We went back to work.
[03:35:22.584 --> 03:35:24.365]  They didn't.
[03:35:24.365 --> 03:35:26.867]  Let's try it again.
[03:35:26.867 --> 03:35:27.628]  See what happens again.
[03:35:29.155 --> 03:35:31.317]  Let's have a second wave.
[03:35:31.317 --> 03:35:31.997]  What do we care?
[03:35:31.997 --> 03:35:36.460]  We'll call it a second wave, a new outbreak, or whatever.
[03:35:36.460 --> 03:35:43.265]  Chinese government considers all their citizens to be completely disposable.
[03:35:43.265 --> 03:35:45.166]  Let's get that straight.
[03:35:45.166 --> 03:35:49.510]  Whatever it is, they're 1.2, 1.3 billion people.
[03:35:49.510 --> 03:35:54.913]  If they lose a few million, do you think the Chinese regime really cares?
[03:35:54.913 --> 03:35:55.654]  No, they don't.
[03:35:58.183 --> 03:36:06.906]  So, they're just looking at, well, look what a tremendous effect it had on our enemy the first time when we locked down $100 billion, $50 billion.
[03:36:06.906 --> 03:36:13.288]  They did the lockdown and, gee, that was fortunate by accident.
[03:36:13.288 --> 03:36:24.572]  Just happened to lock down America, following in our footsteps, and England, and Germany, and all these other countries who are basically our enemies.
[03:36:26.377 --> 03:36:28.618]  Isn't that good for us?
[03:36:28.618 --> 03:36:29.479]  Yeah!
[03:36:29.479 --> 03:36:30.440]  So let's try it again.
[03:36:30.440 --> 03:36:33.882]  Another lockdown.
[03:36:33.882 --> 03:36:34.782]  Yeah.
[03:36:34.782 --> 03:36:37.084]  Face a new lockdown, a second wave.
[03:36:37.084 --> 03:36:39.785]  There's no second wave.
[03:36:39.785 --> 03:36:41.526]  The tests, okay?
[03:36:41.526 --> 03:36:42.587]  Covered this before.
[03:36:42.587 --> 03:36:45.309]  The tests are complete frauds.
[03:36:45.309 --> 03:36:51.232]  The so-called PCR test that's been used widely all over the world.
[03:36:51.232 --> 03:36:52.133]  Quite expensive.
[03:36:54.141 --> 03:36:58.704]  Doesn't tell you whether a person is sick or is going to get sick.
[03:36:58.704 --> 03:37:01.085]  Never did, never will.
[03:37:01.085 --> 03:37:09.170]  Covered this in extreme details before on the show here on my website.
[03:37:09.170 --> 03:37:12.672]  Even quoted their own reports.
[03:37:12.672 --> 03:37:18.796]  World Health Organization, FDA, CDC admitting tests are flawed.
[03:37:20.313 --> 03:37:30.541]  Even a positive test indicating the presence of the virus does not necessarily indicate infectious virus or cause of disease.
[03:37:30.541 --> 03:37:34.404]  Well then, what are you doing the test for?
[03:37:34.404 --> 03:37:44.632]  Antibody test riddled with false positives, cross reactions as they're called to any manner of other things, covered that as well.
[03:37:45.808 --> 03:37:49.469]  Renders all the case numbers based on those tests.
[03:37:49.469 --> 03:37:52.530]  Completely meaningless.
[03:37:52.530 --> 03:37:54.791]  Completely meaningless.
[03:37:54.791 --> 03:37:57.552]  Easy to fabricate, just make it up.
[03:37:57.552 --> 03:38:04.414]  In the hospitals, they write COVID-19 on people's folders, on their death certificates.
[03:38:04.414 --> 03:38:07.635]  They make more money that way in the hospitals.
[03:38:07.635 --> 03:38:11.116]  They're going broke, etc., etc.
[03:38:11.116 --> 03:38:14.757]  Even when they're not doing it for that reason, it's easier.
[03:38:16.215 --> 03:38:17.796]  Eyeball diagnosis.
[03:38:17.796 --> 03:38:19.898]  Many of the doctors are true believers.
[03:38:19.898 --> 03:38:22.519]  Well, elevated temperature.
[03:38:22.519 --> 03:38:24.280]  Apparent lung problems.
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:25.241]  Must be COVID.
[03:38:25.241 --> 03:38:27.002]  No, it must not be COVID.
[03:38:27.002 --> 03:38:28.083]  Could be flu.
[03:38:28.083 --> 03:38:30.244]  Could be anything.
[03:38:30.244 --> 03:38:31.585]  Air pollution.
[03:38:31.585 --> 03:38:33.086]  Whatever.
[03:38:33.086 --> 03:38:34.347]  Bad vaccine.
[03:38:34.347 --> 03:38:37.989]  A million other things.
[03:38:37.989 --> 03:38:41.732]  Jeez, are these stupid, man.
[03:38:41.732 --> 03:38:44.954]  How stupid do you have to be as a doctor?
[03:38:46.141 --> 03:38:50.664]  To go along with this crap.
[03:38:50.664 --> 03:38:52.485]  You know, we put these people up on the pedestal.
[03:38:52.485 --> 03:38:55.947]  Well, they've had all this training and background and so forth.
[03:38:55.947 --> 03:38:56.567]  Yeah.
[03:38:56.567 --> 03:39:00.190]  So why are they so stupid then?
[03:39:00.190 --> 03:39:04.973]  And such robots that they go along with this insanity.
[03:39:04.973 --> 03:39:10.216]  To say nothing, of course, of the so-called medical reporters, mainstream medical.
[03:39:10.216 --> 03:39:11.076]  Oh, yes.
[03:39:11.076 --> 03:39:13.498]  And COVID and this and COVID that.
[03:39:17.219 --> 03:39:24.125]  I don't want to brag, but I've been analyzing these fake epidemics for 30-some odd years now.
[03:39:24.125 --> 03:39:34.754]  And, you know, just as a matter of course, just as a matter of looking into things, I know more right here, right?
[03:39:34.754 --> 03:39:35.734]  See this?
[03:39:35.734 --> 03:39:37.075]  See this right here?
[03:39:37.075 --> 03:39:38.897]  Right in this little place?
[03:39:38.897 --> 03:39:45.042]  Than these medical reporters know here.
[03:39:45.042 --> 03:39:45.863]  They're parrots.
[03:39:46.621 --> 03:39:47.602]  They lie.
[03:39:47.602 --> 03:39:48.523]  They make it up.
[03:39:48.523 --> 03:39:49.744]  They follow orders.
[03:39:49.744 --> 03:39:50.544]  They obey.
[03:39:50.544 --> 03:39:52.466]  The COVID is a threat.
[03:39:52.466 --> 03:39:53.607]  The COVID is a threat.
[03:39:53.607 --> 03:39:55.168]  The COVID is a threat.
[03:39:55.168 --> 03:39:56.469]  We have the PCR.
[03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:58.491]  We have the genetic testing.
[03:39:58.491 --> 03:40:02.494]  Oh, here's the voodoo language.
[03:40:02.494 --> 03:40:09.941]  Here's all the technical gobbledygook that proves that we're right and everybody else doesn't know what they're talking about.
[03:40:09.941 --> 03:40:14.945]  These are the times to try men's souls.
[03:40:16.718 --> 03:40:18.920]  Summer Patriots.
[03:40:18.920 --> 03:40:23.323]  Sunshine Patriots.
[03:40:23.323 --> 03:40:25.984]  Just going to sit and take this stuff.
[03:40:25.984 --> 03:40:31.848]  Just going to say anytime you want to lock us down, we're happy to be locked down.
[03:40:31.848 --> 03:40:42.956]  A broken city like New York, where people used to be tough and nasty and independent and smart.
[03:40:42.956 --> 03:40:46.098]  The dumbest person in New York was very smart.
[03:40:47.665 --> 03:40:50.666]  I lived there, I can tell you that.
[03:40:50.666 --> 03:40:58.629]  You could get in an argument on the street with anybody in the entire city of New York, and they would have something smart to say.
[03:40:58.629 --> 03:41:01.810]  Anybody!
[03:41:01.810 --> 03:41:14.314]  And now, they're all pod people, wearing masks, behaving like zombies, sucking on the teat of the state.
[03:41:18.283 --> 03:41:21.846]  New York City alone could overthrow this entire thing in one night.
[03:41:21.846 --> 03:41:23.147]  People come out of their apartments.
[03:41:23.147 --> 03:41:24.248]  They come out of their houses.
[03:41:24.248 --> 03:41:25.469]  They open their businesses.
[03:41:25.469 --> 03:41:30.173]  Yeah, this was Bayesian the Body Snatchers.
[03:41:30.173 --> 03:41:31.174]  The good one.
[03:41:31.174 --> 03:41:33.917]  Donald Sutherland.
[03:41:33.917 --> 03:41:36.779]  Leonard Nimoy.
[03:41:36.779 --> 03:41:37.880]  Right.
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:38.941]  That's what happened.
[03:41:38.941 --> 03:41:41.063]  They turned into pod people in New York.
[03:41:45.051 --> 03:41:50.432]  Could have come out and opened up their businesses and said, ah, these people are idiots in the government.
[03:41:50.432 --> 03:41:53.533]  Who listens to that kind of crap?
[03:41:53.533 --> 03:41:55.094]  We're New Yorkers.
[03:41:55.094 --> 03:41:55.614]  We're tough.
[03:41:55.614 --> 03:41:56.474]  We're smart.
[03:41:56.474 --> 03:41:58.995]  We don't buy any of this nonsense.
[03:41:58.995 --> 03:42:03.276]  We're opening up our stores, our groceries, our restaurants, our whatever.
[03:42:03.276 --> 03:42:04.416]  We're not wearing masks.
[03:42:04.416 --> 03:42:10.418]  We're not paying attention to these morons.
[03:42:10.418 --> 03:42:10.758]  Really?
[03:42:10.758 --> 03:42:11.458]  You're going to put
[03:42:12.833 --> 03:42:16.754]  I don't know, 50,000, 100,000, 300,000 of us in jail?
[03:42:16.754 --> 03:42:19.675]  You're gonna shoot us down in the streets?
[03:42:19.675 --> 03:42:23.617]  Is that really what you're gonna do?
[03:42:23.617 --> 03:42:25.537]  We don't think so.
[03:42:25.537 --> 03:42:28.178]  Get out of our way!
[03:42:28.178 --> 03:42:32.140]  That's the New York I remember.
[03:42:32.140 --> 03:42:37.161]  What happened to it?
[03:42:37.161 --> 03:42:39.442]  Really, I mean really, what happened to it?
[03:42:41.527 --> 03:42:42.988]  The Big Apple is dying.
[03:42:42.988 --> 03:42:44.169]  This is the New York Post.
[03:42:44.169 --> 03:42:46.131]  The streets are empty.
[03:42:46.131 --> 03:42:47.932]  Yeah.
[03:42:47.932 --> 03:42:51.815]  Big Apple is dying.
[03:42:51.815 --> 03:42:52.916]  And?
[03:42:52.916 --> 03:42:53.917]  Yeah?
[03:42:53.917 --> 03:42:55.197]  And?
[03:42:55.197 --> 03:42:56.719]  And what?
[03:42:56.719 --> 03:42:58.060]  A little hand wringing?
[03:42:58.060 --> 03:42:59.981]  Is that what it is?
[03:42:59.981 --> 03:43:04.705]  Order a few more products from Amazon to be shipped?
[03:43:04.705 --> 03:43:06.646]  I mean, what?
[03:43:06.646 --> 03:43:09.348]  What?
[03:43:09.348 --> 03:43:10.890]  New York just a bunch of pussies?
[03:43:10.890 --> 03:43:11.330]  Is that it?
[03:43:12.558 --> 03:43:14.199]  Seven, eight million?
[03:43:14.199 --> 03:43:17.721]  Can't come out on the street and end this whole thing?
[03:43:17.721 --> 03:43:20.443]  Not with a riot, not burning and looting.
[03:43:20.443 --> 03:43:25.006]  Look at this idiot.
[03:43:25.006 --> 03:43:26.107]  Oh.
[03:43:26.107 --> 03:43:27.127]  Oh, isn't that neat?
[03:43:27.127 --> 03:43:28.108]  Oh, it smells good.
[03:43:28.108 --> 03:43:28.808]  Yeah.
[03:43:28.808 --> 03:43:29.969]  Uh-huh.
[03:43:29.969 --> 03:43:31.390]  Isn't that wonderful?
[03:43:31.390 --> 03:43:35.793]  Put him to work in Death Valley, Troubling Sand.
[03:43:35.793 --> 03:43:37.414]  Jeez, you elected this guy?
[03:43:41.926 --> 03:43:43.948]  Wow.
[03:43:43.948 --> 03:43:52.094]  Overnight could end this whole thing for the world in New York.
[03:43:52.094 --> 03:44:07.046]  New York tonight revolted against the puppet of the CDC and Bill Gates, Cuomo, de Blasio, and went back to work.
[03:44:07.046 --> 03:44:11.089]  The construction workers showed up and said, we're going back to work.
[03:44:13.499 --> 03:44:16.541]  The contractor showed up and said, we're going back to work.
[03:44:16.541 --> 03:44:20.703]  The restaurant's open and said, take those stupid signs off the table.
[03:44:20.703 --> 03:44:23.145]  We're not flying at half mast.
[03:44:23.145 --> 03:44:25.086]  Open up the outdoors.
[03:44:25.086 --> 03:44:26.287]  Open the whole thing up.
[03:44:26.287 --> 03:44:28.228]  We're going back to work.
[03:44:28.228 --> 03:44:30.890]  Serve anybody that comes in.
[03:44:30.890 --> 03:44:32.831]  Crowd the joint up.
[03:44:32.831 --> 03:44:38.114]  The bars, the Irish bars in New York, what happened to them?
[03:44:38.114 --> 03:44:42.176]  I thought the Irish were the toughest, nastiest people around.
[03:44:42.176 --> 03:44:43.077]  What are they doing now?
[03:44:43.911 --> 03:44:47.433]  Sitting home drinking rotgut?
[03:44:47.433 --> 03:44:51.914]  Fill up the Irish bars in New York, 8 deep.
[03:44:51.914 --> 03:44:53.395]  We're open for business.
[03:44:53.395 --> 03:44:54.976]  We're going back to work.
[03:44:54.976 --> 03:44:57.777]  Forget this whole nightmare.
[03:44:57.777 --> 03:45:00.138]  We're ending it right now in New York.
[03:45:00.138 --> 03:45:04.200]  Tonight.
[03:45:04.200 --> 03:45:07.521]  Why not?
[03:45:07.521 --> 03:45:11.203]  Why not?
[03:45:11.203 --> 03:45:11.483]  Okay.
[03:45:13.240 --> 03:45:15.803]  That's it for this week.
[03:45:15.803 --> 03:45:17.245]  It's a hoax.
[03:45:17.245 --> 03:45:19.148]  It's an attack.
[03:45:19.148 --> 03:45:19.849]  Resist it.
[03:45:19.849 --> 03:45:23.133]  John Rappaport sitting in for Alex here.
[03:45:23.133 --> 03:45:23.834]  See you next time.
