[00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:07.853]  We're mobilizing our military and other forces, but we're mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine.
[00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:10.715]  You know, it's a massive job to give this vaccine.
[00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:18.279]  Our military is now being mobilized, so at the end of the year, we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.102]  What nightmare alternate universe have we woken up in?
[00:00:24.982 --> 00:00:27.764]  Where President Trump is out Fauci-ing Fauci.
[00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:41.665]  Where President Trump is going further than even the UN, the WHO are, even further than Bill Gates has, and is saying he'll have the military mobilized to inoculate every single American.
[00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:46.029]  Is President Trump trying to create hope that he's got a solution to the COVID-19?
[00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:54.216]  The solution to the COVID-19 hysteria is, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, not having fear.
[00:00:54.716 --> 00:00:58.180]  Because the only fear we have to fear is fear itself.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.343]  This thing isn't even as deadly as the flu.
[00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:06.208]  They're counting every other death that happens as COVID-19.
[00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.790]  It's all confirmed.
[00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:11.158]  That's why they can cycle it up and cycle it down.
[00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:19.362]  They can say, oh, we're getting thousands of deaths a day or no deaths a day because they chose the common cold as their fraud.
[00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:37.557]  And now with the whole history of vaccine damage and Bill Gates even admitting that this new vaccine is going to cause a lot of side effects and health problems and with the secret vaccine fund since 1986 paying on over four billion dollars people damaged by vaccines and the fact that Trump promised to appoint a commission with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:40.939]  heading it up to expose the dangers of vaccines it is a
[00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:55.468]  Major, major betrayal of common sense, the Bill of Rights, of the Constitution, and of President Trump's most ardent supporters to come out with a draconian unconstitutional announcement like this.
[00:01:56.048 --> 00:02:01.652]  Because the implication of having the military do it is if you don't go along with it, you're not with the US military.
[00:02:02.037 --> 00:02:16.080]  And the implication is this is going to be a forced inoculation as the Democratic Party, the UN, and Bill and Melinda Gates have proposed, including the New York Times today, to make everyone take the inoculation to be able to have a travel pass to get on a plane or have a job.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.161]  This is medical tyranny run by the WHO.
[00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:29.783]  And if President Trump goes along with this, he has made himself a true enemy of common sense, of medical freedom and safety, and of the American people.
[00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:37.273]  We must all contact the president however we can and Congress and demand the president come back to his senses and reverse course now.
[00:02:37.714 --> 00:02:40.357]  But regardless, they're coming with forced inoculations.
[00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:44.862]  They're coming with their HR 6666 with the contact tracers.
[00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:47.806]  They are coming for our freedoms and we must refuse.
[00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:50.646]  I think we're going to have a vaccine by the end of the year.
[00:02:50.686 --> 00:02:52.267]  We're doing very well with the vaccine.
[00:02:52.947 --> 00:02:54.409]  And I will tell you something.
[00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.010]  I just literally left a meeting.
[00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.996]  We're mobilizing our military and other forces, but we're mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine.
[00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:06.818]  You know, it's a massive job to give this vaccine.
[00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.480]  Our military is now being mobilized.
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.404]  So at the end of the year, we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly.
[00:03:14.764 --> 00:03:20.768]  And you're just doing something with syringes as well, so that you can have it plentiful.
[00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:21.788]  You have enough vaccine.
[00:03:21.808 --> 00:03:28.413]  We will have the tremendous force, because assuming we get it, then you have to distribute it.
[00:03:28.773 --> 00:03:32.996]  And unless you're mobilized and ready, you're not going to be able to do it for a long time.
[00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:34.256]  So we're starting now.
[00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:42.842]  We're of the assumption that by the end of the year, we're going to have a vaccine, and then we have to be able to give it, to use it on most of our population.
[00:03:43.302 --> 00:04:01.361]  The ultimate solution, the only thing that really lets us go back completely to normal and feel good about sitting in a stadium with lots of other people is to create a vaccine and not just take care of our country but take that vaccine out to the global population.
[00:04:02.822 --> 00:04:16.846]  We clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're most at risk of that and doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you don't have side effects.
[00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:28.510]  You know, if we have, you know, 1 in 10,000 side effects, that's, you know, way more, 700,000, you know, people who will suffer from that.
[00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:42.616]  Really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges, you know, pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities, it's very, very hard.
[00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:57.346]  And that actual decision of, okay, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world, governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.
[00:04:57.546 --> 00:05:09.251]  You first go into a phase one trial to see if it's safe and you have very few people, 45 people within a certain age group, all healthy, none at really any great risk of getting infected.
[00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:12.833]  The reason you do that, because you want to make sure that it's safe.
[00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:16.875]  And the next thing you do, and that takes about three months, easily maybe more.
[00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:19.576]  So that's going to bring us into the beginning or middle of the summer.
[00:05:20.336 --> 00:05:26.162]  Then you go to a Phase 2 trial, or what we say 2-3, which means we're going to put a lot of people in there.
[00:05:26.662 --> 00:05:34.130]  Now we hope that there aren't a lot of people getting infected, but it is likely there will be somewhere in the world where that's going on.
[00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:41.096]  So it's likely that we will get what's called an efficacy signal, and we will know whether or not it actually works.
[00:05:42.037 --> 00:05:48.941]  If in fact it does, we hope to rush it to be able to have some impact on recycling in the next season.
[00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:54.043]  Now, the issue of safety is something that I want to make sure the American public understand.
[00:05:54.884 --> 00:06:03.048]  It's not only safety when you inject somebody and they get maybe an idiosyncratic reaction, they get a little allergic reaction, they get pain.
[00:06:03.648 --> 00:06:05.089]  There's safety associated
[00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.430]  Does the vaccine make you worse?
[00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:16.835]  And there are diseases in which you vaccinate someone, they get infected with what you're trying to protect them with, and you actually enhance the infection.
[00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:20.256]  You can get a good feel for that in animal models.
[00:06:20.616 --> 00:06:24.198]  So that's going to be interspersed at the same time that we're testing.
[00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:27.280]  We're going to try and make sure we don't have enhancement.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.443]  So the worst possible thing you could do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse.
[00:06:34.087 --> 00:06:35.367]  But you don't have a choice.
[00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:36.728]  People act like you have a choice.
[00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:54.494]  Two years ago, when InfoWars got deplatformed off of more than 60 major systems, friends, family, callers, neighbors, the community asked me, Alex, how are you taking it?
[00:06:55.374 --> 00:07:02.797]  What is it like to be completely banned out of cyberspace and then have these people tell incredible lies about you when you can't defend yourself?
[00:07:03.888 --> 00:07:07.029]  And I said to them, well, it doesn't hurt me.
[00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:25.534]  It hurts all of us collectively because the precedence being set with these AI systems to come in and control every facet of our lives, everything we say, everything we do, down the level of even getting rid of websites that have consumer reports where the general public can give your own reviews.
[00:07:26.872 --> 00:07:33.995]  The system wants total AI surveillance in real time to block what you say and do, even in text messages.
[00:07:34.775 --> 00:07:40.017]  And I told people that two years ago, and now in the middle of 2020, it's now all official.
[00:07:41.318 --> 00:07:51.862]  Major medical doctors, heads of hospitals, Cedars-Sinai, are being banned off the internet if they come out and expose COVID-19 as an overblown power grab hype.
[00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:59.900]  Doctors that are pointing out that its death rate is lower than the flu off the NIH's own numbers are being banned off YouTube, off Twitter, off Facebook.
[00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:10.029]  They're now banning nationalist and patriot candidates and even members of Congress off the internet because we the people have failed to act against this tyranny.
[00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:18.175]  Now I knew we needed to build Band.Video and put up bigger video and audio servers and Band.Video has exploded.
[00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:19.597]  Infowars.com has exploded.
[00:08:20.549 --> 00:08:22.752]  And I'm seeing so many other sites be taken down.
[00:08:22.812 --> 00:08:26.897]  I'm seeing hundreds and hundreds of other prominent people just being disappeared every week.
[00:08:26.957 --> 00:08:33.424]  So, I cannot stress to all of you how important it is to understand the enemy psychology behind this.
[00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:39.572]  They start with an Alex Jones, and then down the road they move on to a David Icke, and then it's Candace Owens.
[00:08:41.024 --> 00:08:49.032]  And every other journalist and person I talk to now is scared about what they can even say because they're having their videos and their articles blocked on a daily basis.
[00:08:49.593 --> 00:08:54.978]  And Twitter has implemented systems that in live time look at your tweet and decide whether or not you can send it out.
[00:08:55.759 --> 00:09:01.185]  And it's tweets that are valid and truthful and that expose corruption that are being banned.
[00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:05.166]  That's why the most unpopular speech is always protected.
[00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:10.428]  Because once you get rid of unpopular speech, then you can allow everyone else's speech to be taken away.
[00:09:10.808 --> 00:09:11.768]  That's how it works.
[00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:21.912]  And so, here we are in 2020, and the censorship is increasing to levels not even in 1984, not even what George Orwell dreamed of in a nightmare.
[00:09:22.732 --> 00:09:23.392]  And it's here now.
[00:09:24.113 --> 00:09:25.253]  So please realize that
[00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:32.039]  People are hungry for the truth right now and they have a right to know how they manipulated the COVID-19 numbers.
[00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:37.707]  The public has a right to know that it came out of the Wuhan lab that we first told you 12 weeks ago that's now confirmed.
[00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:46.437]  The people have a right to know about the globalist moves to establish world government and bankrupt small businesses and make us dependent on them.
[00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:55.904]  The public has a right to know and then challenge it when major governments now propose forced microchipping of the population for you to be able to leave your home.
[00:09:56.924 --> 00:10:05.171]  Bill and Melinda Gates came out a few months ago with a patent to track us in real time and give us cryptocurrency if we operate like robots and follow all their orders.
[00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:08.373]  Then they have another patent for an implantable chip under the skin
[00:10:08.735 --> 00:10:12.416]  To prove with a digital tattoo that you've had the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:20.278]  And now Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel has proposed making all the children have a microchip and tracking what they do to save us from COVID-19.
[00:10:21.018 --> 00:10:24.879]  COVID-19 is the excuse to bring in this entire system.
[00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:32.421]  It's the excuse with all the draconian AI and implantable microchips to come in and force us into this tyranny.
[00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:33.661]  And we must say no.
[00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:35.722]  This is the globalist revolution against humanity.
