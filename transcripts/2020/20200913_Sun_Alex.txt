[00:00:02.349 --> 00:00:03.490]  This perfect storm.
[00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.572]  The debate is over around climate change.
[00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:09.533]  Just come to the state of California.
[00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:11.655]  Observe it with your own eyes.
[00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:12.996]  It's not an intellectual debate.
[00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:14.877]  It's not even debatable.
[00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:18.279]  The debate is over around climate change.
[00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.703]  California's rogue governor says the fires are due to climate change.
[00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:30.806]  But anyone with a modicum of awareness knows that this is an outrageous lie.
[00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:35.459]  We know exactly what causes the California wildfire.
[00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.421]  It is the result of two factors, dry seasons and people.
[00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:49.705]  Official state records have only been kept since the 1950s, and 2020 has been the most destructive season on record.
[00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:56.968]  But this isn't a new phenomenon, and the fires of the past were more destructive than the modern era.
[00:00:58.128 --> 00:01:12.461]  Through studies of tree rings and other natural evidence, researchers have documented multiple droughts in California during the past thousand years, including one that began in the year 850, which lasted two and a half centuries.
[00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:23.832]  Before European settlers arrived in California, indigenous peoples used controlled burns to manage the dry season and to increase and improve their harvest.
[00:01:24.572 --> 00:01:29.374]  It is estimated they would burn 4.4 million acres of forest each year.
[00:01:30.274 --> 00:01:31.694]  And that is twice as much as 2020.
[00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:38.657]  Studies have shown that 97% of all forest fires are caused by humans.
[00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:43.819]  Smoking, campfires, and other accidents have always been a problem.
[00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:50.401]  Experts blame the recent wildfires on fire suppression and an overabundance of wood fuel.
[00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:56.391]  One of the reasons why the indigenous people burned so much forest was to keep this under control.
[00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.321]  Aside from human accidents, there is also arson.
[00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.422]  And we have seen plenty of arson in 2020.
[00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:07.183]  It's been sort of the theme.
[00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:13.687]  If this country doesn't give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it.
[00:02:14.347 --> 00:02:18.529]  Several people have been arrested for starting fires along the entire West Coast.
[00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.251]  Homeowners are catching arsonists on their property.
[00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:28.714]  There are reports of people throwing Molotov cocktails out of moving vehicles on the freeway.
[00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.754]  And there are videos of arsonists setting people's homes on fire.
[00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:49.225]  We know for certain that at least one of the arrested arsonists is directly involved with the BLM Antifa movement.
[00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:53.631]  And the rest certainly seem to fit the bill.
[00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:58.225]  Local news is reporting on it.
[00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:01.526]  A man has been arrested accused of starting this fire.
[00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:06.208]  One of two men accused of intentionally setting fire to fields along freeways.
[00:03:06.428 --> 00:03:10.129]  But the FBI and the mainstream media are in full denial.
[00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:19.431]  A Clackamas County Sheriff's deputy was placed on administrative leave after warning locals about coordinated arson attacks.
[00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.973]  What I'm worried about is that there's people stashing stuff, right?
[00:03:23.013 --> 00:03:23.253]  Right.
[00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:26.316]  It means that they're going to go in preparation, right?
[00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:30.859]  And I don't want to sound like some doomsdayer, but it's getting serious.
[00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.342]  And the Democrat Party is telling you it is all climate change.
[00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:37.283]  Mother Earth is angry.
[00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:47.630]  She's telling us, whether she's telling us with hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, fires in the West, whatever it is, that the climate crisis is real and has an impact.
[00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.371]  And telling you that the fires will soon come to your town if you don't vote for climate change.
[00:03:54.791 --> 00:04:03.713]  What we're experiencing right here is coming to a community all across the United States of America unless we get our act together on climate change.
[00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:13.215]  Which is a pretty nasty threat considering how many cities across America have burned by the hands of radical leftists over the summer.
[00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:30.493]  The 2006 film Apocalypto beautifully illustrated how the ancient Mayans' advanced knowledge of astronomy could have been used to frighten the superstitious masses into offering their own to be sacrificed on the altar of false idols.
[00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:34.556]  Who had the power to blacken out the sun.
[00:04:35.897 --> 00:04:38.038]  And there is nothing new under the sun.
[00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.643]  People today will throw away their children's birthright because of ignorance, faith in false idols,
[00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:50.594]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, September 13th, the year is 2020.
[00:04:51.494 --> 00:04:55.455]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you live on this Sunday show.
[00:04:55.475 --> 00:05:04.297]  We're going to be here live for the next two hours, then Owen Schroyer comes in with the new Sunday show live, called Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:05.917]  Central Standard Time.
[00:05:06.277 --> 00:05:09.438]  Roger Stone is out in Reno, Nevada, where President Trump is.
[00:05:09.938 --> 00:05:22.161]  And while Trump's speaking, Roger Stone is going to be joining us via video Skype from very nearby, getting into the big national headlines that Roger Stone's calling for martial law and a military coup.
[00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:34.725]  No, Roger Stone on this show last Wednesday said if they're calling for a coup against the president and against the election and the people, Trump has to take action against them.
[00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:35.645]  But that's how they
[00:05:36.658 --> 00:05:37.578]  Reverse reality.
[00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:41.260]  Former head of the Treasury, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, has the headline from Zero Hedge.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.721]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:05:43.221 --> 00:05:44.602]  Paul Craig Roberts, the U.S.
[00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:47.043]  and its Constitution have two months left.
[00:05:47.383 --> 00:05:51.265]  The deep state is trying to remove President Trump.
[00:05:53.706 --> 00:05:58.208]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, here's the false headlines out of Forbes.
[00:05:58.628 --> 00:06:03.811]  Roger Stone calls on Trump to seize total power and assert martial law.
[00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:05.432]  But could he?
[00:06:06.223 --> 00:06:07.164]  Here's the London Independent.
[00:06:07.524 --> 00:06:11.386]  Roger Stone tells Trump to bring martial law if he loses election.
[00:06:11.847 --> 00:06:12.587]  Did not say that.
[00:06:12.627 --> 00:06:13.408]  There is no quote.
[00:06:13.468 --> 00:06:13.988]  It's made up.
[00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:16.570]  Roger Stone calls on Trump to seize total power.
[00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.351]  It's in the London Guardian.
[00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:19.412]  It's in the New York Times.
[00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.013]  It's in the Washington Post.
[00:06:21.153 --> 00:06:22.053]  It's everywhere.
[00:06:23.514 --> 00:06:30.259]  And it's our response to the headlines of General Mattis' plotted secret coup against Trump that was all over the news this week.
[00:06:31.127 --> 00:06:45.357]  So he comes on air and responds to that, responds to Democrats, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, all calling for the military, including the former Attorney General Eric Holder, to remove Trump.
[00:06:46.178 --> 00:06:47.359]  We say, man, that's illegal.
[00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:50.001]  If you try a military coup, we'll have to have you arrested.
[00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:54.544]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, comes out and says it's illegal what Democrats want.
[00:06:55.184 --> 00:06:59.508]  And just like that, they distort reality yet again.
[00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:03.277]  One more time for everybody.
[00:07:04.098 --> 00:07:07.381]  And they tell you that Roger Stone wants martial law.
[00:07:09.403 --> 00:07:16.431]  That's how they operate over and over and over and over again.
[00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:21.296]  And now we're 50 days out from the historic election.
[00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:25.070]  And the Democrats are planning their next move.
[00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:31.531]  If you go to InfoWars.com, you'll see the live show feed headline tonight.
[00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:34.132]  And it's quite the headline.
[00:07:37.673 --> 00:07:51.096]  It's quite the headline when you go up to InfoWars.com and you see the name of the show this evening, confirmed deep state arsonist behind record-breaking West Coast wildfires
[00:07:52.605 --> 00:08:00.529]  Plus new coup plot against Trump goes mainstream.
[00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:16.818]  And if you look at what the Environmental Protection Agency did, but particularly what the Democrats did out in particularly the West Coast, but all over the country in the 70s and 80s, they got laws and regulations passed.
[00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:21.921]  California has the most draconian of any state where you cannot cut fire breaks
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.641]  into wilderness and you can't clean out the underbrush.
[00:08:28.121 --> 00:08:34.204]  And everywhere the left's in control, like here in Austin, millions of trees have tags on them, even little trees.
[00:08:35.384 --> 00:08:39.086]  And if you get caught cutting them down or doing something, they throw you in jail.
[00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.187]  Now there's many photos.
[00:08:41.207 --> 00:08:42.527]  You can just type it into a search engine.
[00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:45.168]  Examples of fire breaks stopping fires.
[00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:46.289]  I'll do that for you next segment.
[00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:52.311]  And you can see famous cases of where a road will stop
[00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:55.079]  A major fire.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.060]  This is all just basic science.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.981]  It's what humans have done for thousands of years.
[00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:06.462]  But since the 70s, California has not allowed any brush to be cut, any kindling to be removed.
[00:09:06.502 --> 00:09:16.044]  So it's giant piles of debris that when there's a lightning strike or arson or high winds, all hell breaks loose.
[00:09:16.064 --> 00:09:17.904]  We'll be covering all of that.
[00:09:18.953 --> 00:09:26.400]  Coming up next segment when I can show you some photos of just the amazing information of what happens with firebreaks.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:36.230]  There's all these famous photos of you'll see a big long road and where a fire burned right up to the road and then stops because the road acts as a natural firebreak.
[00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.412]  It's amazing to see what happens.
[00:09:38.492 --> 00:09:41.215]  And the Democrats know full well what they're doing.
[00:09:41.835 --> 00:09:43.036]  China builds firebreaks.
[00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:45.436]  North Korea builds firebreaks.
[00:09:45.856 --> 00:09:49.398]  We're not allowed to because it's all part of the sabotage default.
[00:09:49.718 --> 00:09:51.299]  Just like they want the dams blown up.
[00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:54.300]  And they want men not to be men and women not to be women.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.722]  And they want fuzzy math to be taught.
[00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:58.903]  Common Core 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:09:59.343 --> 00:10:00.344]  People thought that was a joke.
[00:10:00.384 --> 00:10:01.084]  That's real.
[00:10:01.964 --> 00:10:04.546]  And now they're just getting rid of standardized testing altogether.
[00:10:04.866 --> 00:10:06.947]  This is how you collapse the civilization.
[00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:10.089]  This is how you collapse the society now.
[00:10:12.813 --> 00:10:25.359]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm gonna get to the shocking footage, that's some of the most shocking yet, of when two sheriff's deputies are assassinated.
[00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:26.380]  We're gonna play that video.
[00:10:27.581 --> 00:10:34.304]  Their attempted assassination ambush, both shot, both in critical condition, in Los Angeles, for no reason but for being police.
[00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:39.867]  Then Black Lives Matter showed up trying to enter the hospital, screaming, we hope you all die.
[00:10:40.998 --> 00:10:48.623]  And then there was some other police officers that were killed in another area, and the media is celebrating their random execution and their death as well.
[00:10:49.103 --> 00:10:58.889]  So that is all coming up today, and then Roger Stone will be joining us coming up in the second hour from Reno, Nevada.
[00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.192]  But what an incredible time to be alive and watching all of this unfold.
[00:11:05.714 --> 00:11:06.194]  Separately,
[00:11:07.773 --> 00:11:28.781]  There's a meme going around the internet saying one day after California legalizes pedophilia, and then it just shows this image of the famous Bay Area skyline with the big pyramidal traveler's insurance building, and it looks like an image of Dante's Inferno.
[00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:35.343]  That's the headline, Newsom signs bill removing automatic penalty for consensual sex acts involving minors.
[00:11:38.117 --> 00:11:40.058]  But children don't have the age of consent.
[00:11:40.078 --> 00:11:41.578]  That's why they can't sign contracts.
[00:11:42.018 --> 00:11:43.719]  That's why they can't join the military.
[00:11:44.119 --> 00:11:46.980]  That's why they can't have sex until they're 18.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:57.904]  It's because people don't want their children being tricked like they do in Eastern Europe, young girls, and put them on a plane, fly them into sex slavery and say, Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:03.746]  They've also changed the age of consent to 11 for abortions and vaccinations, where you're
[00:12:04.747 --> 00:12:09.911]  Eleven-year-old can be talked into by the counselor at school to kill their baby or take deadly vaccines.
[00:12:10.332 --> 00:12:12.293]  That's the state coming in and becoming the parents.
[00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:14.555]  And it is so incredibly evil.
[00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:18.158]  California still carries out secret sterilizations, it's come out in the news.
[00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:19.359]  So does Oregon.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.640]  It's all eugenics.
[00:12:21.621 --> 00:12:22.662]  And it's all about power.
[00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:24.484]  It's all about control.
[00:12:26.049 --> 00:12:27.650]  So they want this dystopic future.
[00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.452]  That's why all the big movies are like Blade Runner and show this hellish future that's coming.
[00:12:32.013 --> 00:12:38.216]  By 2018, supposedly the skies would look like San Francisco's dude back in that 1980s film, Blade Runner.
[00:12:38.236 --> 00:12:41.178]  Yeah, a few years late, but now it's here.
[00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:47.822]  All because they knowingly will not allow any firebreaks to be repaired or built.
[00:12:48.163 --> 00:12:50.284]  They've all grown back up over 30, 40 years.
[00:12:50.584 --> 00:12:52.785]  There's now kindling and dead trees everywhere.
[00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:54.987]  Oh, but also Facebook banned
[00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:08.718]  Facebook banned anyone criticizing the fact that it was arsonists being arrested and saying that's fake news, that it's climate change.
[00:13:08.858 --> 00:13:10.899]  Because when Democrats say something, it's the law.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.282]  Even though they just arrested a bunch of arsonists who shot video of them setting the main fires.
[00:13:15.823 --> 00:13:20.906]  In Oregon, in California, they're arresting arsonists who just so happen to be Antifa and BLM.
[00:13:21.146 --> 00:13:23.608]  And that's in local ABC, CBS, NBC News.
[00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:28.506]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:13:28.926 --> 00:13:29.846]  Oh, you're a medical doctor?
[00:13:29.866 --> 00:13:31.387]  Say hydroxychloroquine cures your patients?
[00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:32.668]  Boom, you're taking off YouTube.
[00:13:33.668 --> 00:13:34.769]  Oh, you're the head of a hospital?
[00:13:34.849 --> 00:13:35.409]  They fire you.
[00:13:36.569 --> 00:13:37.650]  And who first reports you?
[00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:38.250]  Big Tech.
[00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:39.611]  They're the minders.
[00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:41.031]  They're the controllers.
[00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:43.912]  This is going to be one hell of a Sunday transmission.
[00:13:43.932 --> 00:13:45.133]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.294]  Please remember, the only way we reach more people
[00:13:48.772 --> 00:13:55.214]  One way we counter all this corruption is when you spread the word about that local TV station or radio station you're listening to.
[00:13:55.234 --> 00:14:02.976]  And even if you have friends and family outside the area that don't have a local station, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show and band out video and share the live link.
[00:14:03.116 --> 00:14:03.596]  Confirmed.
[00:14:03.956 --> 00:14:04.857]  Deep state arsonists.
[00:14:05.797 --> 00:14:08.119]  Behind record-breaking West Coast wildfires.
[00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:09.320]  They set up the climate for it.
[00:14:09.621 --> 00:14:13.284]  They set up not allowing the cutting down of the trees or the dead wood or the kindling.
[00:14:13.724 --> 00:14:18.489]  And then they hype it all up and then their leftist agitators go out and start burning things down.
[00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:23.633]  Then they blame it on you and tell you it's all your fault because you're middle class while they fly around in jumbo jets.
[00:14:23.653 --> 00:14:24.034]  Stay with us.
[00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:31.612]  You know, I'm gonna come back next segment and get into what's really happening with the fires and the rest of the story.
[00:14:31.933 --> 00:14:33.353]  Tucker covers about 90% of it.
[00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.175]  I'll give you the rest of it on the other side.
[00:14:35.195 --> 00:14:40.158]  Then I'll get into the police being hunted down and killed and what's really behind that and more 50 days out from the election.
[00:14:40.178 --> 00:14:51.145]  But here's part of Tucker Carlson just a few days ago laying out what's really happening with their claim that it's all climate change when in reality it's their own actions on purpose premeditatedly to destroy civilization as we know it.
[00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:51.526]  Here it is.
[00:14:55.452 --> 00:14:58.536]  Good evening and welcome to a special edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[00:14:58.696 --> 00:15:00.498]  You probably didn't see it live.
[00:15:00.558 --> 00:15:01.439]  Not many people did.
[00:15:01.939 --> 00:15:08.107]  But last month, a former Republican member of Congress called Susan Molinari spoke at the Democratic National Convention.
[00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:10.730]  If you thought about it, it was an odd moment.
[00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.972]  Susan Molinari is a very nice person, actually.
[00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:14.594]  People who know her like her.
[00:15:15.535 --> 00:15:19.397]  But it wasn't really clear what she was doing speaking at the Democratic Convention.
[00:15:19.437 --> 00:15:24.620]  Most Democratic voters probably never have heard of Susan Molinari, and her whole speech lasted just a moment.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.761]  So what was the point of it, exactly?
[00:15:27.221 --> 00:15:27.942]  Well, here's the point.
[00:15:28.382 --> 00:15:30.903]  Susan Molinari was a top lobbyist for Google.
[00:15:31.243 --> 00:15:33.204]  She was a senior executive at Google until 2018.
[00:15:34.665 --> 00:15:38.348]  She wasn't at the DNC to speak to anyone watching from home on TV.
[00:15:38.868 --> 00:15:41.210]  She was speaking to the Democratic Party itself.
[00:15:41.611 --> 00:15:43.072]  Her message to them was very clear.
[00:15:43.552 --> 00:15:45.333]  Silicon Valley is on your side.
[00:15:45.454 --> 00:15:46.875]  We'll help you win this thing.
[00:15:47.515 --> 00:15:51.879]  By inviting Susan Molinari, Democrats also sent a message back to Silicon Valley.
[00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:54.020]  You have nothing to fear from us.
[00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:56.922]  Elect Joe Biden and you can keep your monopolies.
[00:15:56.963 --> 00:15:59.545]  You can extend your control over American life.
[00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:02.656]  This was a bargain a long time in the making.
[00:16:03.136 --> 00:16:08.717]  Immediately after Donald Trump was elected in 2016, executives at Google held a company-wide meeting.
[00:16:08.817 --> 00:16:10.538]  Really, it was more of a group therapy session.
[00:16:11.018 --> 00:16:15.079]  The company's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, broke down in tears as she spoke.
[00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:24.582]  She asked how Google could, quote, use the great strength and resources and reach we have to continue to advance really important values, end quote.
[00:16:25.042 --> 00:16:25.902]  What are those values?
[00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:27.503]  They're not your values.
[00:16:28.283 --> 00:16:31.707]  Google co-founder Sergey Brin was also devastated by Trump's victory.
[00:16:31.827 --> 00:16:34.330]  He found the election, quote, deeply offensive.
[00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:38.515]  Watch Brin go full encounter group in front of his employees.
[00:16:39.737 --> 00:16:45.383]  Most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad for
[00:16:47.708 --> 00:16:56.516]  Because of the election, as an immigrant and a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive.
[00:16:56.936 --> 00:16:59.618]  Is there anything positive you see from this election result?
[00:17:03.482 --> 00:17:05.684]  Boy, that's a really tough one right now.
[00:17:06.952 --> 00:17:07.172]  Hmm.
[00:17:07.673 --> 00:17:08.874]  Another oppressed billionaire.
[00:17:09.414 --> 00:17:19.301]  At the same meeting, Brin suggested that Google change its algorithm, the very core of its search business, to promote, quote, better quality of governance and decision-making.
[00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:21.022]  What does that mean?
[00:17:21.823 --> 00:17:24.705]  In other words, they want to subvert democracy.
[00:17:24.725 --> 00:17:27.987]  And everyone in the room knew exactly what he was saying, and they got to work doing it.
[00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:31.429]  Two years later, video of that company-wide meeting leaked.
[00:17:31.489 --> 00:17:33.171]  Any other company would have been ashamed of it.
[00:17:34.008 --> 00:17:41.414]  The head of America's most powerful corporation caught on camera planning to manipulate voting in elections.
[00:17:42.034 --> 00:17:43.055]  But Google was not embarrassed.
[00:17:43.075 --> 00:17:44.196]  They didn't stop either.
[00:17:44.216 --> 00:17:45.978]  No one made them stop, so they continued.
[00:17:46.678 --> 00:17:48.099]  Last year, a new video emerged.
[00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:57.367]  This video showed a woman called Jen Janai, who works in the artificial intelligence unit at Google, confessing to trying to manipulate the 2020 election, the one underway now.
[00:17:57.907 --> 00:18:06.854]  Jenai said, quote, we all got screwed over in 2016, so we're rapidly been like, what happened there, and how do we prevent it from happening again?
[00:18:08.716 --> 00:18:19.305]  Once again, she's speaking about the results of a free and fair Democratic election that Google, the most powerful company in the world, didn't like, so they're trying to make sure it never happens again.
[00:18:20.406 --> 00:18:22.548]  It's brazen, but they're doing it.
[00:18:23.493 --> 00:18:24.214]  Why are they doing it?
[00:18:24.754 --> 00:18:25.615]  Well, imagine you're them.
[00:18:26.015 --> 00:18:29.759]  Imagine we're back in 2016 and you're a tech executive in Northern California.
[00:18:29.779 --> 00:18:30.520]  You're in your 30s.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.283]  You're not particularly impressive, though you have all the right credentials.
[00:18:33.743 --> 00:18:37.006]  And yet, somehow, you are now worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:18:37.627 --> 00:18:39.929]  And you look on as Donald Trump wins the White House.
[00:18:39.949 --> 00:18:43.252]  He's running on the most populous Republican platform since Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:18:43.633 --> 00:18:47.456]  On the other side, openly socialist candidates are elected to Congress.
[00:18:48.217 --> 00:18:50.239]  People are tired of oligarchs like you.
[00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:51.760]  You have not improved America.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.881]  You know this could be very bad for you.
[00:18:54.242 --> 00:18:57.304]  Someone might tax your stock options or seize your private islands.
[00:18:57.324 --> 00:18:58.365]  So what do you do next?
[00:18:59.261 --> 00:19:00.741]  Well, Silicon Valley had a few ideas.
[00:19:01.482 --> 00:19:07.143]  First, they boosted Democrats who were aligned with Wall Street and multi-billion dollar companies like theirs.
[00:19:07.844 --> 00:19:18.127]  As long as people were distracted by identity politics, as long as they were fighting about unresolvable issues like race and gender, you might be able to distract them long enough that you could pull this off.
[00:19:19.212 --> 00:19:25.720]  You won't talk about the fact that you don't pay taxes if you're busy attacking cops and other powerless members of the working class.
[00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:32.228]  So there's a reason Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are now the standard bearers of the Democratic Party.
[00:19:32.288 --> 00:19:35.311]  It's not because Democratic voters love them so much they didn't.
[00:19:35.812 --> 00:19:36.893]  It's because they're compliant.
[00:19:37.654 --> 00:19:39.816]  Joe Biden has trouble formulating sentences clearly.
[00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:41.878]  He's not posing a threat to tech monopolies.
[00:19:41.918 --> 00:19:45.060]  Of course not, after 50 years of shilling for corporations.
[00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:53.167]  And no politician has demonstrated more clearly her ability to use race tension to divide this country more effectively than Kamala Harris has.
[00:19:53.928 --> 00:19:55.749]  Kamala Harris has applauded the riots.
[00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.390]  Watch.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.503]  I want to make clear that I know that there are protests still happening in major cities across the United States.
[00:20:02.643 --> 00:20:06.246]  I'm just not seeing the reporting on it that I had for the first few weeks.
[00:20:06.686 --> 00:20:07.167]  That's right.
[00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:08.268]  But they're not going to stop.
[00:20:08.328 --> 00:20:09.288]  They're not going to stop.
[00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:12.251]  This is a movement, I'm telling you.
[00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:17.795]  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:21.417]  Everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[00:20:21.538 --> 00:20:23.239]  They're not going to let up, and they should not.
[00:20:25.609 --> 00:20:29.290]  The rioters aren't going to let up, and they should not, says Kamala Harris.
[00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:30.150]  Right.
[00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:35.371]  This is the same Kamala Harris who tweeted that Michael Brown was murdered by cops in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:36.492]  He wasn't murdered.
[00:20:36.812 --> 00:20:37.832]  That's not speculation.
[00:20:37.892 --> 00:20:41.313]  Barack Obama's own Justice Department concluded he wasn't murdered.
[00:20:41.713 --> 00:20:42.393]  That's a lie.
[00:20:42.753 --> 00:20:47.494]  But Harris repeated it anyway, and her allies at Twitter allowed her to disseminate that lie nationwide.
[00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:48.935]  They didn't pull that tweet down.
[00:20:49.855 --> 00:20:53.476]  So Silicon Valley is doing all it can to help the Biden-Harris ticket.
[00:20:54.246 --> 00:20:55.327]  And this is just the beginning.
[00:20:55.407 --> 00:21:02.733]  This year, for example, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and other billionaires threw major financial support behind an organization called Acronym.
[00:21:03.273 --> 00:21:08.998]  Reportedly, Acronym has set up bogus news sites and swing states to portray Democrats in a positive light.
[00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:14.762]  Oh, kind of like the propaganda they claimed Russia was propagating in the last election.
[00:21:15.383 --> 00:21:15.563]  Right.
[00:21:15.923 --> 00:21:18.905]  This is the party that loves to complain about the death of local journalism.
[00:21:19.326 --> 00:21:21.828]  But they are funding a propaganda network
[00:21:23.038 --> 00:21:25.319]  To change people's opinions before an election.
[00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:28.080]  And the goal, of course, isn't just to make Democrats look good.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.662]  It's to make you terrified, because scared populations are easier to control.
[00:21:32.342 --> 00:21:36.844]  That's why Facebook blocked a video featuring the president pointing out an obvious scientific truth.
[00:21:37.244 --> 00:21:38.505]  And no scientist disagrees with this.
[00:21:38.945 --> 00:21:43.027]  Children are mostly not at risk from the effects of the coronavirus.
[00:21:43.607 --> 00:21:50.010]  According to the scientific journal, The Lancet, the virus is, quote, generally a mild disease in children, including infants.
[00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.051]  Fatal outcomes are, quote, rare.
[00:21:53.109 --> 00:22:00.914]  If you knew that, you might have real questions about the lockdowns Joe Biden and the teachers' unions and so many other institutions in this country are pushing.
[00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:02.815]  So you can't know it.
[00:22:02.895 --> 00:22:06.937]  Facebook decided you should not be able to see those data from the Lancet.
[00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:16.843]  Twitter went a step further and had their 27-year-old liberal arts majors lock down the president's campaign account until the campaign deleted video of themselves.
[00:22:16.863 --> 00:22:18.364]  All right, folks, we're a live show.
[00:22:18.384 --> 00:22:19.464]  A lot of crazy stuff happens.
[00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:20.425]  That's part of the fun of it.
[00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:25.469]  They played the wrong clip, but that's actually more important, Tucker, on Silicon Valley.
[00:22:25.889 --> 00:22:36.858]  The part I wanted to get to was how he lays out the history with their own clips of them saying the world's going to end if you don't give total power over to all of them, and then showing how they changed the law to not let you cut any of the firebreaks that are needed.
[00:22:37.319 --> 00:22:38.540]  This is simple, folks.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.682]  This is like not grounding the electricity in your house.
[00:22:41.702 --> 00:22:43.084]  You're going to get struck by lightning and burn down.
[00:22:43.784 --> 00:22:45.245]  The Democrats know exactly what they're doing.
[00:22:45.285 --> 00:22:46.306]  It's shutting America down.
[00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:46.947]  We'll be right back.
[00:22:49.187 --> 00:22:49.868]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:22:49.948 --> 00:22:50.989]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:52.911]  And listen, I can talk for 10 hours straight.
[00:22:53.452 --> 00:22:54.313]  Everybody knows that.
[00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:58.818]  But I've always said if somebody better comes along, I'd step aside for them.
[00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:03.483]  So I don't normally air two clips of Tucker Carlson in one hour.
[00:23:04.504 --> 00:23:07.187]  But since I mentioned it, I thought we'd get to this report.
[00:23:07.207 --> 00:23:10.630]  And then I'll come back next segment and get into the unbelievable pedophile news.
[00:23:11.571 --> 00:23:19.252]  That's just out in the open as the world awakens to the real currency that the Democratic Party and their controllers are involved in, and that's the innocence and essence of our children.
[00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:21.473]  So that is all coming up next segment.
[00:23:21.493 --> 00:23:24.293]  It'll be a very powerful special report, so you'll want to stay with us.
[00:23:25.093 --> 00:23:28.954]  And then Roger Stone is going to be joining us.
[00:23:29.014 --> 00:23:38.576]  You know, I was going to air these cops being shot in cold blood, and I was going to air people coming to the hospital, trying to kill them inside, saying they hope they die, but maybe we just shouldn't give people attention like that.
[00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:40.565]  Maybe I shouldn't play those clips.
[00:23:40.865 --> 00:23:46.007]  Those clips are on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com if you want to go look at them.
[00:23:46.507 --> 00:23:48.768]  But I'm not going to subject people to this, I guess.
[00:23:49.949 --> 00:23:51.009]  Maybe that's not what God wants.
[00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:55.651]  Because... Maybe people should see all this.
[00:23:55.731 --> 00:24:00.492]  It's kind of like not wanting you to see the horrible pedophile stuff.
[00:24:00.512 --> 00:24:01.192]  I don't want to show that.
[00:24:01.212 --> 00:24:04.053]  But at the same time, we do need to expose it, don't we?
[00:24:04.073 --> 00:24:05.034]  Let me think about that.
[00:24:05.994 --> 00:24:07.275]  Let me think about that a little bit.
[00:24:07.895 --> 00:24:08.055]  But...
[00:24:10.694 --> 00:24:16.675]  This is intentional, the shutdown of our dams, our industry, our energy sectors, our families, our culture.
[00:24:17.776 --> 00:24:19.696]  All of this is the admitted plan to bring the United States down.
[00:24:19.736 --> 00:24:22.297]  That's how we're being conquered is from without by the globalists.
[00:24:22.317 --> 00:24:23.637]  They're making their move right now.
[00:24:24.537 --> 00:24:36.560]  And this country's burning in all the blue cities and blue states because they have paid rioters doing it, paid criminals doing it, and they also have not let anybody cut fire breaks.
[00:24:37.699 --> 00:24:38.440]  I'll explain it again.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.201]  Just type in firebreak and click images on any search engine.
[00:24:41.582 --> 00:24:47.466]  You'll see what firebreaks do and how fires will burn right up to a road and stop right after a firebreak and stop.
[00:24:47.846 --> 00:24:49.867]  Firebreaks aren't allowed in these western areas.
[00:24:51.248 --> 00:24:58.393]  You know, we've got a ranch in East Texas and the state came through in the 50s and said we're cutting a firebreak through here.
[00:24:59.073 --> 00:24:59.674]  Imminent domain.
[00:24:59.714 --> 00:25:05.418]  We said please and it makes a nice area through the forested area and they come through with a big old
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:12.886]  Brush cutters, you know, every five, six years and they go back through there and they cut them with these big tractors.
[00:25:13.888 --> 00:25:16.611]  And it's good to have, you know, access on our land and good to have them do that.
[00:25:16.651 --> 00:25:19.754]  But that's why you don't have this type of stuff going on in Texas, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:20.435 --> 00:25:21.997]  TV viewers should see the examples of this.
[00:25:22.017 --> 00:25:24.280]  Here's part of what Tucker Carlson had to say about it Friday night.
[00:25:30.742 --> 00:25:32.823]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[00:25:33.163 --> 00:25:39.106]  Massive wildfires, unprecedented in their scope, continue to sweep across huge portions of the West tonight.
[00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:43.669]  In Oregon, half a million residents have been forced to evacuate their homes.
[00:25:44.089 --> 00:25:46.570]  That's one of every ten people in the entire state.
[00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.211]  Dozens are dead, including small children.
[00:25:49.652 --> 00:25:51.873]  But the fires still are not close to contained.
[00:25:52.313 --> 00:25:54.194]  Watch this report from Fox's Jeff Paul.
[00:25:55.523 --> 00:26:03.520]  Months of tinder dry conditions added to days of high winds and hot temperatures, creating a perfect firestorm across the West.
[00:26:04.349 --> 00:26:12.816]  California is one of the hardest hit, with a record-breaking 3 billion acres burned and nearly 4,000 homes and buildings lost so far.
[00:26:13.276 --> 00:26:16.859]  A 12-year-old boy and his grandmother are among the latest deaths.
[00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:22.023]  The flames are spreading so fast, it really doesn't give people much time to get out.
[00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:31.390]  The fire is also taking a toll in Washington State, where more than 100 homes are gone, and a one-year-old boy died as his family tried to flee the flames.
[00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:37.454]  And in Oregon, more than 35 fires are burning, with at least five small towns destroyed.
[00:26:37.774 --> 00:26:40.456]  Resources across the West are stretched thin.
[00:26:42.105 --> 00:26:44.847]  It is awful, and it continues as we speak right now.
[00:26:44.927 --> 00:26:47.308]  Walls of flame consuming everything in their path.
[00:26:47.388 --> 00:26:52.932]  Homes, thousands and thousands, untold numbers of animals, and of course as we said, human beings too.
[00:26:53.452 --> 00:26:55.453]  It is tragedy on a massive scale.
[00:26:55.954 --> 00:26:59.736]  When something this terrible happens, decent people pause.
[00:27:00.176 --> 00:27:02.478]  They put their own interests aside for a moment.
[00:27:02.518 --> 00:27:04.179]  They consider how they can help.
[00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:07.361]  We've seen that kind of selflessness before in this country.
[00:27:07.401 --> 00:27:09.362]  This is, remember, the anniversary of 9-11.
[00:27:10.723 --> 00:27:14.647]  But there are others for whom altruism is an unknown concept.
[00:27:14.687 --> 00:27:15.908]  Self-interest is all they know.
[00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:17.650]  These people do not pause.
[00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:18.231]  They never do.
[00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:22.595]  They relentlessly press forward for any advantage under any circumstances.
[00:27:22.915 --> 00:27:26.099]  They see human suffering as a means to increase their personal power.
[00:27:26.639 --> 00:27:31.984]  These are the people who turn funerals into political rallies and feel no shame for doing it.
[00:27:32.725 --> 00:27:36.328]  As Americans burned to death, people like this swung into action immediately.
[00:27:36.728 --> 00:27:39.290]  They went on television with a partisan talking point.
[00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.992]  Climate change, they said, caused these fires.
[00:27:43.653 --> 00:27:45.994]  They didn't explain how exactly that happened.
[00:27:46.334 --> 00:27:47.335]  How did climate change do that?
[00:27:47.355 --> 00:27:49.336]  They didn't tell us, but they just kept saying it.
[00:27:50.277 --> 00:27:54.679]  In the hands of democratic politicians, climate change is like systemic racism in the sky.
[00:27:55.119 --> 00:27:59.001]  You can't see it, but rest assured it's everywhere, and it's deadly.
[00:27:59.501 --> 00:28:01.963]  And like systemic racism, it is your fault.
[00:28:02.403 --> 00:28:04.104]  The American middle class did it.
[00:28:04.384 --> 00:28:05.564]  They caused climate change.
[00:28:05.985 --> 00:28:07.025]  They ate too many hamburgers.
[00:28:07.065 --> 00:28:08.526]  They drove too many SUVs.
[00:28:08.906 --> 00:28:10.066]  They had too many children.
[00:28:10.387 --> 00:28:14.809]  A lot of them wear t-shirts to work and didn't finish college, and that causes climate change too.
[00:28:15.785 --> 00:28:19.268]  And worst of all, some of them may vote for Donald Trump in November.
[00:28:19.788 --> 00:28:30.117]  And if there's anything that absolutely, definitively causes climate change, and literally over 100% of scientists agree with this established fact, it is voting for Donald Trump.
[00:28:30.237 --> 00:28:32.399]  You might as well start a tire fire in your yard.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.781]  Joe Biden has checked the science and he agrees with this.
[00:28:36.607 --> 00:28:46.489]  Yesterday, the people on Biden's staff who understand the internet tweeted out an image of the wildfires, along with this message, quote, So once again, by voting for Donald Trump, you are causing climate change, which causes devastating fires.
[00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:50.010]  You, by your vote, have made hundreds of thousands of Oregonians homeless tonight.
[00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.030]  You've murdered people.
[00:29:06.274 --> 00:29:14.817]  Joe Biden's closest friend in the world, a prominent kite surfer on Martha's Vineyard called Barack Obama, echoed that message with his trademark restraint.
[00:29:15.477 --> 00:29:19.219]  Obama declared that your life depends on voting for Joe Biden.
[00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:21.820]  Hold on a minute, you might ask.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:29.083]  Doesn't this very same Barack Obama own a $12 million spread right on the ocean in Massachusetts?
[00:29:29.843 --> 00:29:35.265]  At a time when sea levels are rising so fast, we're about to see killer whales in the Rockies.
[00:29:36.203 --> 00:29:37.243]  Well, that doesn't make sense.
[00:29:37.904 --> 00:29:41.465]  It doesn't seem like Barack Obama could be very concerned about climate change.
[00:29:42.285 --> 00:29:44.226]  And by the way, didn't Obama go to law school?
[00:29:44.706 --> 00:29:46.067]  When did he become a scientist?
[00:29:47.027 --> 00:29:48.508]  Those seem like reasonable questions.
[00:29:49.088 --> 00:29:54.310]  On the other hand, lawyers pretending to be scientists are now everywhere in the Democratic Party.
[00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:57.112]  Here, for example, is the governor of Washington State, Jay Inslee.
[00:29:57.552 --> 00:30:01.073]  Inslee's a proud graduate of Willamette University Law School.
[00:30:01.513 --> 00:30:04.555]  He's explaining that he's already figured out the cause of the fires.
[00:30:04.975 --> 00:30:05.195]  Watch.
[00:30:06.451 --> 00:30:10.672]  These are conditions that are exacerbated by the changing climate that we are suffering.
[00:30:11.773 --> 00:30:21.655]  And I do not believe that we should surrender these subdivisions or these houses to climate change exacerbated fires.
[00:30:21.695 --> 00:30:24.136]  We should fight the cause of these fires.
[00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:31.158]  So I mismanaged my state, now it's on fire, you're required to give me more power.
[00:30:32.098 --> 00:30:32.339]  Right.
[00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:33.459]  You see how that works.
[00:30:34.295 --> 00:30:37.357]  But as a factual matter, this is a crock.
[00:30:37.978 --> 00:30:47.845]  There is not a single scientist on Earth who knows whether or by how much these fires may have been, quote, exacerbated by warmer temperatures caused by climate change.
[00:30:48.843 --> 00:30:55.526]  All we have is conjecture from a handful of scientists and many politicians, none of whom has reached a definitive conclusion.
[00:30:55.586 --> 00:31:04.470]  Daniel Swain, for example, he's a climate scientist at UCLA, conceded recently that it's, quote, hard to determine whether climate change played a role in sparking the fires.
[00:31:05.451 --> 00:31:05.771]  Okay.
[00:31:06.571 --> 00:31:07.892]  That's what science is.
[00:31:08.372 --> 00:31:09.112]  It's gradual.
[00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:10.233]  It's incremental.
[00:31:10.473 --> 00:31:11.373]  Often it's tentative.
[00:31:11.393 --> 00:31:13.094]  We don't say things we don't know for certain.
[00:31:13.894 --> 00:31:15.095]  It's the opposite of politics.
[00:31:15.845 --> 00:31:16.446]  They have nothing.
[00:31:16.486 --> 00:31:21.613]  Alright, the full Tucker Carlson report is on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, but I wanted to play that.
[00:31:22.654 --> 00:31:24.236]  Let's go further and give you the rest of the story.
[00:31:25.958 --> 00:31:29.503]  California is famous for having fires.
[00:31:29.844 --> 00:31:32.767]  When people went out there for the gold rush, they would have lightning strikes and big fires.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:48.630]  But the difference is, lightning would then burn its own firebreaks, and large areas would be allowed to burn down, so there was fires later, there would be natural firebreaks from where previous fires had happened, and you'd have a random patchwork of where forest wasn't, and where forest was, from previous wildfires.
[00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.312]  Wildfires are part of the carbon cycle on this planet.
[00:31:52.692 --> 00:32:01.638]  You've got these mask-wearing fraudsters that gave you the COVID shenanigans, up there now telling you there's not enough electricity, we have to not have electricity because of
[00:32:03.137 --> 00:32:04.498]  Climate change and all the rest of this.
[00:32:05.078 --> 00:32:09.420]  And now that's climate change's fault when really they're just ripping you off and running scams and mismanaging.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.760]  And now they won't cut fire breaks, so that's your fault.
[00:32:12.061 --> 00:32:21.584]  And then Facebook censoring everybody, including local TV stations and police departments that have arrested dozens of arsonists who videotaped themselves in many cases setting the very damn fires.
[00:32:22.145 --> 00:32:27.567]  But oh no, it's climate change, so Big Tech won't let you know it's arsonists that wait for it to get dry with high winds.
[00:32:29.209 --> 00:32:34.631]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones, broadcasting live on this Sunday edition, and I'll just be completely honest with the listeners.
[00:32:36.511 --> 00:32:39.872]  I almost could not do this show today, and I don't do that to be dramatic.
[00:32:40.532 --> 00:32:42.533]  I never choked 26 years on air.
[00:32:44.613 --> 00:32:57.797]  And I'm not choking now, it's just that I study this stuff so much, that by the time I get up here, after probably doing, let's not exaggerate, six hours of research today,
[00:32:59.264 --> 00:33:01.365]  That I am so angry at these people.
[00:33:01.425 --> 00:33:02.305]  It's beyond angry.
[00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:04.646]  I can't believe this is all going on.
[00:33:05.527 --> 00:33:06.507]  I know this is a war.
[00:33:06.607 --> 00:33:07.467]  I know it's an assault.
[00:33:07.587 --> 00:33:11.869]  I know it's 21st century war where they can't militarily attack us front on.
[00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:20.193]  So this international crime syndicate, the globalists, are doing it through the culture, through the corruption, through the people they've manipulated, through their economic power.
[00:33:20.573 --> 00:33:21.673]  But it's so obvious.
[00:33:21.773 --> 00:33:22.814]  It's so admitted.
[00:33:22.894 --> 00:33:24.034]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:33:24.734 --> 00:33:25.755]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:33:27.346 --> 00:33:37.971]  So let me just hit this and then I'll hit the... At least six cops in the last two days got executed in the United States.
[00:33:39.652 --> 00:33:40.792]  And we'll never even know their names.
[00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:41.773]  It's a minor footnote.
[00:33:42.613 --> 00:33:45.215]  Two more got shot in Los Angeles and are fighting for their lives.
[00:33:46.255 --> 00:33:49.777]  And I got up early this morning at like 4 a.m.
[00:33:49.797 --> 00:33:51.938]  because I can't sleep now because of this.
[00:33:52.955 --> 00:34:09.544]  And I went on Infowars.com and I saw the articles about the cops getting shot, and then I clicked on Paul Watson's Twitter, and it was these people coming to the hospital saying, we hope the cops die, and just acting like complete maniacs.
[00:34:09.664 --> 00:34:13.426]  And I didn't hate them because they were black people, because there's a bunch of white people acting just like them.
[00:34:13.926 --> 00:34:15.627]  I hated them because they're so stupid!
[00:34:16.724 --> 00:34:23.948]  You might get 14 black guys killed wrongfully a year by police, and a few hundred black guys shot by police a year.
[00:34:25.569 --> 00:34:28.511]  You're twice as likely to be shot if you're white per capita.
[00:34:30.672 --> 00:34:38.577]  It's not just there's more white people, if you're a white man, you're twice as likely to be shot by the police, because the police aren't scared to shoot you if you pull a gun on them.
[00:34:38.597 --> 00:34:44.301]  And cops aren't perfect, there's certainly some bad ones, but I'm watching these black dudes with BLM go to the hospital,
[00:34:45.933 --> 00:34:50.836]  And there's like hours of this footage, daring cops to shoot him, screaming, hoping the police die.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:57.139]  Because they think there's an epidemic of black people being killed by police.
[00:34:57.579 --> 00:35:01.681]  This is mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:03.562 --> 00:35:06.164]  Because the media creates the perception
[00:35:08.131 --> 00:35:15.113]  That there is a record number of black people being killed by police, because there's 370 million people in this country.
[00:35:15.133 --> 00:35:15.853]  330 million citizens.
[00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:21.835]  And if you want to show every time a black dude gets shot, you can see it almost every day!
[00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:26.696]  And most of the time, the black dude pulls a gun and shoots themselves, the cops get blamed.
[00:35:27.016 --> 00:35:29.837]  Or he pulls a gun on the cops, it's black cops, the cops get blamed.
[00:35:30.397 --> 00:35:36.079]  And I'm against the police when they're following legal orders, beating up people because they're not wearing a mask, whether they're black or white.
[00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:38.636]  I'm all about going after bad cops.
[00:35:38.996 --> 00:35:40.397]  I'm all about going after the police state.
[00:35:41.118 --> 00:35:58.070]  But the police state's the globalist, hyping up a bunch of dumb people, black and white, to go out and to shoot cops in the head for no reason, or just random white people pull into BLM checkpoints, or Antifa checkpoints.
[00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.171]  They just shoot you in the head.
[00:35:59.531 --> 00:36:03.874]  And when they shoot some old white dude in the head because he didn't stop, it's on the local news and that's it.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.887]  You see white people when they see a crowd of Antifa or black folks killing an innocent white person?
[00:36:11.247 --> 00:36:13.189]  Freaking out and going and killing a bunch of white people?
[00:36:15.252 --> 00:36:16.293]  But I'll tell you what's going on.
[00:36:18.636 --> 00:36:21.539]  They're trying to get crazy white people to go out and kill a bunch of black people.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.603]  So you'll see a black church get shot up or something, God forbid.
[00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:30.086]  And then they're going to trigger the real race war, ladies and gentlemen, and that's all this is.
[00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:33.207]  And the average black person, the average white person sees through it.
[00:36:33.227 --> 00:36:52.313]  But when the left and the corporate media are pushing this and saying there's an epidemic of black men being killed by police, to where you see every day a black guy goes into an auto parts store, goes into a shop, and just kills a random white dude, or stabs a random white dude, or shoots him, because they go, well, I gotta get even, because they're killing all of us.
[00:36:52.713 --> 00:36:55.394]  That's the public... It's just like...
[00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:59.831]  You have a .000 something chance of dying of COVID now.
[00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:02.191]  They keep downgrading it, downgrading it, downgrading it.
[00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:07.272]  It does kill people on a blue moon if you're really sick and have three, you know, comorbidities.
[00:37:07.993 --> 00:37:11.273]  So it's not a total hoax, but you know, it's not like an Easter Bunny doesn't exist.
[00:37:11.333 --> 00:37:14.554]  I mean, it's kind of like a duck-billed platypus.
[00:37:14.574 --> 00:37:16.775]  There are a couple of them, but there's almost, they're super rare.
[00:37:16.795 --> 00:37:18.295]  It's like a white rot rhino.
[00:37:18.375 --> 00:37:21.296]  I mean, they exist, but they'll soon be in unicorn land.
[00:37:21.316 --> 00:37:22.116]  They won't exist soon.
[00:37:22.936 --> 00:37:23.136]  You know.
[00:37:24.847 --> 00:37:26.088]  It's like people with two heads.
[00:37:26.168 --> 00:37:27.409]  They do exist, there's not a lot of them.
[00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.650]  So, there is COVID.
[00:37:31.511 --> 00:37:33.612]  But man, you go around everywhere, people think it's real.
[00:37:33.652 --> 00:37:36.174]  You tell them, hey, statistically, they go, I know somebody died!
[00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:38.115]  And I go, how old were they?
[00:37:38.135 --> 00:37:39.075]  87 with cancer!
[00:37:40.116 --> 00:37:41.937]  Well, you know, they put that on the death certificate.
[00:37:42.037 --> 00:37:42.437]  Shut up!
[00:37:42.497 --> 00:37:43.418]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:37:44.238 --> 00:37:44.799]  It's the same thing.
[00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:47.300]  Hey, I've been at these Black Lives Matter protests.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.461]  Sylvana Hernandez has been attacked.
[00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:51.923]  She's like, statistically, you're more likely to drown than be killed by a cop.
[00:37:52.223 --> 00:37:53.744]  Shut up, white supremacists!
[00:37:55.327 --> 00:38:01.392]  It's the invincible level of the ignorance that is staggering.
[00:38:03.053 --> 00:38:04.754]  And so, two L.A.
[00:38:04.794 --> 00:38:10.498]  County deputies fighting for their lives after ambush shooting, search for suspect underway.
[00:38:10.558 --> 00:38:12.840]  They said it was a black man, a man with dark skin.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:17.744]  Video shows two deputies ambushed, shot while inside patrol vehicle in Compton.
[00:38:21.513 --> 00:38:25.700]  Two LA Sheriff's deputies, again, were taken to the hospital.
[00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:32.375]  For gunshot wounds, BLM responds by rushing to the scene, we hope they die.
[00:38:32.735 --> 00:38:39.000]  Protestors gather outside hospital, treating two California deputies in critical condition.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:44.865]  And then they come over to the cops, saying we hope you die, we hope they die, we're gonna kill you.
[00:38:44.885 --> 00:38:49.989]  And then when the cops walk out with their hands on their guns, they go, what the hell are you doing?
[00:38:50.009 --> 00:38:50.949]  You're abusing me!
[00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:59.984]  It's like when you run out and jump on somebody's car, they try to go around you, you try to pull them out of the car, and they get out and beat your ass, and then you squeal and yell for the police!
[00:39:00.986 --> 00:39:03.029]  This is mental illness.
[00:39:03.971 --> 00:39:05.514]  This is brainwashing.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.582]  This is people that literally believe that they're actually under attack when they're not.
[00:39:10.942 --> 00:39:12.303]  Look, I got a bunch of other cops that are dead.
[00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:15.145]  Rest in peace Henderson County Sheriff's Deputy Ryan Hendricks.
[00:39:15.805 --> 00:39:18.107]  Shot and killed in cold blood, investigating a vehicle break-in.
[00:39:18.327 --> 00:39:25.711]  I got all these stacks here of just dead cops executed, but nobody cares about them, and it's not about kissing the police's ass.
[00:39:26.612 --> 00:39:28.913]  It's about kissing the ass of reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:29.634 --> 00:39:31.575]  That it's rare to be killed by the cops.
[00:39:31.615 --> 00:39:32.175]  Does it happen?
[00:39:32.195 --> 00:39:32.415]  Yes.
[00:39:32.756 --> 00:39:33.716]  Are the cops sometimes wrong?
[00:39:33.856 --> 00:39:34.417]  Absolutely.
[00:39:35.197 --> 00:39:36.478]  And they face prison when they do.
[00:39:36.678 --> 00:39:37.358]  Who wants that job?
[00:39:37.658 --> 00:39:44.843]  But in this case, let's go ahead, I already showed you the surveillance video of the person walking up and shooting the police and running off.
[00:39:46.764 --> 00:39:50.466]  This is happening every day in America, all because they were police, all because they were white.
[00:39:50.966 --> 00:39:52.327]  These people shoot black cops too.
[00:39:52.727 --> 00:39:54.148]  Remember this happened last election cycle.
[00:39:55.367 --> 00:39:55.828]  2016-2018.
[00:39:55.868 --> 00:39:58.253]  Soros turns it on.
[00:39:58.593 --> 00:39:59.996]  So, let's just play the clips.
[00:40:00.056 --> 00:40:01.639]  Clips 2, 3, and 4, just back-to-back.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.589]  This is at the hospital, with the deputies fighting for their lives, and then these people show up.
[00:40:06.609 --> 00:40:06.929]  Here it is.
[00:40:15.106 --> 00:40:25.171]  These pigs out here, they are telling us that we cannot come in here and see these individuals who have been shot down at the mother f***ing train station.
[00:40:25.531 --> 00:40:27.032]  You understand what I'm saying?
[00:40:27.112 --> 00:40:28.893]  There's no visitation allowed, sir.
[00:40:28.953 --> 00:40:29.113]  What?
[00:40:29.133 --> 00:40:31.895]  There's no visitation allowed, sir.
[00:40:31.915 --> 00:40:32.055]  Okay.
[00:40:32.075 --> 00:40:34.016]  This is a public hospital right here.
[00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:34.776]  No, it's not.
[00:40:34.856 --> 00:40:36.017]  We're here to see the cops.
[00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:39.708]  It's a private hospital, sir.
[00:40:39.788 --> 00:40:40.650]  It's a public.
[00:40:40.851 --> 00:40:41.913]  No, it's not.
[00:40:42.053 --> 00:40:42.915]  It's not county.
[00:40:42.975 --> 00:40:44.218]  It's private.
[00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:45.561]  You need to go.
[00:40:45.721 --> 00:40:46.563]  It's public.
[00:40:46.643 --> 00:40:48.667]  Black Lives Matter demanding to be in the hospital.
[00:40:50.154 --> 00:40:52.696]  These are only phones.
[00:40:52.977 --> 00:40:54.398]  They're not guns.
[00:40:54.438 --> 00:40:55.919]  Put that s*** down you punk b****.
[00:40:55.939 --> 00:40:56.720]  Put it down!
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.682]  That's why you're a f****** dying one by one!
[00:40:59.702 --> 00:41:00.924]  Put that s*** down!
[00:41:00.944 --> 00:41:03.466]  You're next with the f****** out-of-pocket b****!
[00:41:03.526 --> 00:41:04.026]  They're next!
[00:41:13.515 --> 00:41:19.739]  I mean, obviously, if you show up saying, I hope they die, at the hospital where they're fighting for their lives, people know you're crazy.
[00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:21.180]  So the cops are going to have their guns out.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.822]  Yeah, that's when you feel big and bad, huh?
[00:41:24.842 --> 00:41:26.804]  Take that shit off!
[00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:27.944]  Take that shit off!
[00:41:28.025 --> 00:41:28.945]  Take it off!
[00:41:29.986 --> 00:41:33.228]  And they go on for like 30 minutes saying, we're going to kill you, you're going to die.
[00:41:33.248 --> 00:41:35.630]  You're going to die one by one.
[00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:40.093]  There's a lot of motherfuckers coming down here.
[00:41:40.133 --> 00:41:41.654]  Motherfuckers trying to break motherfuckers.
[00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:45.487]  Meanwhile, 2,000 black males die a year in Chicago.
[00:41:45.507 --> 00:41:52.309]  97% killed by other black males.
[00:41:52.389 --> 00:41:54.970]  The rarest way for a black man to die is by a cop.
[00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:57.471]  The most common way is by another black man.
[00:41:58.691 --> 00:41:59.431]  Or in the womb.
[00:41:59.471 --> 00:42:00.592]  But these people don't care about that.
[00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:03.813]  They've been told by the media, the cops are the enemy, and they actually believe it.
[00:42:04.153 --> 00:42:04.893]  They believe the news.
[00:42:10.274 --> 00:42:11.534]  And folks, there's so many of these videos.
[00:42:11.574 --> 00:42:12.995]  I literally watched an hour of it this morning.
[00:42:13.015 --> 00:42:15.915]  I mean, the crew, I just randomly sent a bunch of links.
[00:42:15.935 --> 00:42:16.955]  This isn't even the bad stuff.
[00:42:20.376 --> 00:42:22.436]  They say, you're gonna die, we're gonna kill you one by one.
[00:42:22.456 --> 00:42:24.637]  And then they wonder why the cops have guns.
[00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:30.318]  Now they're saying they hope that they die.
[00:42:36.812 --> 00:42:38.713]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is all George Soros.
[00:42:39.053 --> 00:42:40.214]  Why is he not arrested?
[00:42:40.854 --> 00:42:44.636]  Now they admit that Mueller's people destroyed 30-plus phones with evidence of criminal activity.
[00:42:44.816 --> 00:42:45.597]  Why aren't they arrested?
[00:42:45.637 --> 00:42:48.338]  That's why they're doing this, because it's a criminal takeover.
[00:42:48.378 --> 00:42:51.259]  It's a criminal move on civilization and society.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.401]  Absolutely no self-awareness.
[00:42:54.761 --> 00:42:59.103]  You go to a hospital where people have been shot for no reason, fighting for their lives, saying you hope they die.
[00:42:59.123 --> 00:43:01.425]  We'll be back with our number two, Roger Stone.
[00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:01.825]  Stay with us.
[00:43:04.619 --> 00:43:05.780]  This perfect storm.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.841]  The debate is over around climate change.
[00:43:09.422 --> 00:43:11.823]  Just come to the state of California.
[00:43:12.383 --> 00:43:13.924]  Observe it with your own eyes.
[00:43:14.004 --> 00:43:15.125]  It's not an intellectual debate.
[00:43:15.145 --> 00:43:16.005]  Look how happy he is.
[00:43:16.025 --> 00:43:17.126]  Look at that monster.
[00:43:17.466 --> 00:43:20.508]  The debate is over around climate change.
[00:43:21.628 --> 00:43:26.951]  California's rogue governor says the fires are due to climate change.
[00:43:27.712 --> 00:43:33.075]  But anyone with a modicum of awareness knows that this is an outrageous lie.
[00:43:34.344 --> 00:43:37.726]  We know exactly what causes the California wildfire.
[00:43:38.326 --> 00:43:42.688]  It is the result of two factors, dry seasons and people.
[00:43:43.529 --> 00:43:51.953]  Official state records have only been kept since the 1950s, and 2020 has been the most destructive season on record.
[00:43:52.813 --> 00:43:59.217]  But this isn't a new phenomenon, and the fires of the past were more destructive than the modern era.
[00:44:00.397 --> 00:44:14.721]  Through studies of tree rings and other natural evidence, researchers have documented multiple droughts in California during the past thousand years, including one that began in the year 850, which lasted two and a half centuries.
[00:44:15.821 --> 00:44:26.084]  Before European settlers arrived in California, indigenous peoples used controlled burns to manage the dry season and to increase and improve their harvest.
[00:44:26.844 --> 00:44:31.650]  It is estimated they would burn 4.4 million acres of forest each year.
[00:44:32.531 --> 00:44:33.953]  And that is twice as much as 2020.
[00:44:35.613 --> 00:44:40.919]  Studies have shown that 97% of all forest fires are caused by humans.
[00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:46.084]  Smoking, campfires, and other accidents have always been a problem.
[00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:52.730]  Experts blame the recent wildfires on fire suppression and an overabundance of wood fuel.
[00:44:53.511 --> 00:44:58.676]  One of the reasons why the indigenous people burned so much forest was to keep this under control.
[00:45:00.117 --> 00:45:03.579]  Aside from human accidents, there is also arson.
[00:45:04.319 --> 00:45:06.681]  And we have seen plenty of arson in 2020.
[00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:09.442]  It's been sort of the theme.
[00:45:09.782 --> 00:45:15.965]  If this country doesn't give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it.
[00:45:16.606 --> 00:45:20.788]  Several people have been arrested for starting fires along the entire West Coast.
[00:45:21.908 --> 00:45:24.510]  Homeowners are catching arsonists on their property.
[00:45:25.691 --> 00:45:31.011]  There are reports of people throwing Molotov cocktails out of moving vehicles on the freeway.
[00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:43.040]  And there are videos of arsonists setting people's homes on fire.
[00:45:44.261 --> 00:45:51.489]  We know for certain that at least one of the arrested arsonists is directly involved with the BLM Antifa movement.
[00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.954]  And the rest certainly seem to fit the bill.
[00:45:58.852 --> 00:46:00.494]  Local news is reporting on it.
[00:46:00.514 --> 00:46:03.817]  A man has been arrested, accused of starting this fire.
[00:46:03.937 --> 00:46:08.481]  One of two men accused of intentionally setting fire to fields along freeways.
[00:46:08.702 --> 00:46:12.405]  But the FBI and the mainstream media are in full denial.
[00:46:13.686 --> 00:46:21.714]  A Clackamas County Sheriff's Deputy was placed on administrative leave after warning locals about coordinated arson attacks.
[00:46:21.894 --> 00:46:25.255]  What I'm worried about is that there's people stashing stuff, right?
[00:46:25.275 --> 00:46:25.515]  Right.
[00:46:25.755 --> 00:46:28.176]  It means that they're going to go in preparation, right?
[00:46:28.716 --> 00:46:33.137]  And I don't want to sound like some doomsdayer, but it's getting serious.
[00:46:33.737 --> 00:46:37.618]  And the Democrat Party is telling you it is all climate change.
[00:46:37.779 --> 00:46:39.539]  Mother Earth is angry.
[00:46:39.559 --> 00:46:49.902]  She's telling us, whether she's telling us with hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, fires in the West, whatever it is, that the climate crisis is real and has an impact.
[00:46:50.302 --> 00:46:56.645]  And telling you that the fires will soon come to your town if you don't vote for climate change.
[00:46:57.065 --> 00:47:05.990]  What we're experiencing right here is coming to a community all across the United States of America unless we get our act together on climate change.
[00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:15.475]  Which is a pretty nasty threat considering how many cities across America have burned by the hands of radical leftists over the summer.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:32.746]  The 2006 film Apocalypto beautifully illustrated how the ancient Mayans' advanced knowledge of astronomy could have been used to frighten the superstitious masses into offering their own to be sacrificed on the altar of false idols.
[00:47:34.026 --> 00:47:36.847]  Who had the power to blacken out the sun.
[00:47:38.148 --> 00:47:40.308]  And there is nothing new under the sun.
[00:47:40.969 --> 00:47:48.551]  People today will throw away their children's birthright because of ignorance, faith in false idols, and their blatant lies.
[00:47:49.792 --> 00:47:52.132]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:47:52.693 --> 00:47:53.813]  Reports on InfoWars, share it.
[00:47:56.104 --> 00:48:11.273]  Well, Roger Stone is out in Reno, Nevada, covering the Trump event there, doing a bunch of big speaking engagements and private events, and we're really appreciating him ducking out into a little studio area to talk to us for just 30 minutes or so, and then he's gotta go.
[00:48:12.754 --> 00:48:19.759]  Is it true that Roger Stone, again, this is Alex Jones Show, if you just tuned in, second hour, Sunday broadcast, is it true that Roger Stone
[00:48:21.175 --> 00:48:26.378]  Called for martial law to be declared if Trump loses the election?
[00:48:26.618 --> 00:48:27.018]  No!
[00:48:27.619 --> 00:48:29.580]  Roger was on the main, I guess, Wednesday.
[00:48:30.933 --> 00:48:34.434]  And we went over the headlines that were in Reuters, AP, everywhere.
[00:48:34.934 --> 00:48:47.597]  General Mattis, according to Bob Woodward's book, wanted a coup and tried to plot a coup, but he couldn't get people to go along with him, even though he had John McCain and other Democrats, John McCain's really a Democrat, with him.
[00:48:48.257 --> 00:48:50.277]  Now, now, we don't just believe what Bob Woodward says.
[00:48:50.297 --> 00:48:51.077]  A lot of it's BS.
[00:48:51.257 --> 00:48:51.877]  We went and looked it up.
[00:48:51.897 --> 00:48:53.138]  There was a coup back at that time.
[00:48:53.218 --> 00:48:54.338]  Roger Stone covered it then.
[00:48:55.018 --> 00:48:58.659]  So by their alchemy, they turned it into Roger Stone calls for that.
[00:48:59.793 --> 00:49:00.414]  Here's the headlines.
[00:49:00.754 --> 00:49:04.156]  James Mattis is caught suggesting military coup against Trump.
[00:49:05.958 --> 00:49:08.159]  Paul Greg Roberts, former head of the Treasury, came out and said the U.S.
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:10.141]  and its Constitution have two months left.
[00:49:10.161 --> 00:49:11.522]  They're trying to have a coup against Trump.
[00:49:13.664 --> 00:49:14.624]  But here's Forbes.
[00:49:14.724 --> 00:49:19.728]  Roger Stone calls on Trump to seize total power and assert martial law.
[00:49:19.768 --> 00:49:20.249]  But could he?
[00:49:21.909 --> 00:49:23.730]  Roger Stone tells Trump to bring in Marshall Law.
[00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:24.470]  He loses the election.
[00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:25.410]  London Independent.
[00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:34.053]  Business Insider's got a long headline talking about all of Roger's plans for total power and the seizure of total control.
[00:49:34.874 --> 00:49:41.776]  Meanwhile, real former JAG officers and generals warn that the Democrats have been canvassing with other Republican rhinos and neocons
[00:49:42.156 --> 00:49:43.537]  For just that.
[00:49:43.838 --> 00:49:46.920]  And everyone's heard Joe Biden say the military is going to remove him.
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.702]  And Bill Clinton said two weeks ago the military needs to remove him.
[00:49:49.983 --> 00:49:52.885]  And Hillary and Eric Holder and they're all saying it.
[00:49:53.125 --> 00:49:57.669]  And Roger comes on and says Trump has a constitutional right and so do we to say no to this.
[00:49:58.049 --> 00:50:02.533]  He talks about that and they got really scared and misrepresented what you said, Rogers.
[00:50:02.894 --> 00:50:10.320]  They now admit contesting the election, as you said months ago on the show, and doing all of this and having civil unrest is their plan.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.721]  Because I know Trump is surging in the polls.
[00:50:12.981 --> 00:50:14.161]  Roger Stone, thanks for joining us.
[00:50:15.582 --> 00:50:25.265]  Alex, I thought it was very important to get on with you today because I've really, actually in 40 years in American politics, I've never quite seen anything like this.
[00:50:25.305 --> 00:50:36.609]  You see, the unhinged left is very upset because I have exposed what they have planned, although it wasn't very hard because they talk about it openly.
[00:50:37.555 --> 00:50:47.742]  And my public comments can be construed as advising the president to legally use his powers to thwart what they have coming.
[00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:56.408]  I never said in any context the president should seize power through martial law if he loses the election.
[00:50:57.388 --> 00:51:01.251]  What I said was if there is overwhelming evidence of fraud,
[00:51:01.906 --> 00:51:20.157]  The president absolutely has the right to use every legal tool, including invoking the Insurrection Act, martial law if necessary, since there is violence in our streets and it is directly traceable to the Biden-Harris globalist forces.
[00:51:21.297 --> 00:51:23.399]  This is one of the most outrageous smears.
[00:51:23.539 --> 00:51:26.040]  I understand it because you see, I'm the boogeyman.
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.882]  Oh, Roger Stone, he's a dirty trickster.
[00:51:29.443 --> 00:51:47.827]  Based on my 40 years in American politics, based on my experience in 10 presidential campaigns, I'm trying to tell anyone who will listen what needs to happen in the event that we have an audacious, blatant, outrageous steal of this election.
[00:51:48.527 --> 00:51:55.528]  And it is not just the mail ballots, the mail-in ballots, where the stealing will take place.
[00:51:56.181 --> 00:52:11.472]  In fact, there's been too much focus on that and not enough focus on the old-fashioned methods of vote stealing as practiced in places like, oh, I don't know, Chicago, Illinois, Palm Beach County, Florida, Broward County, Florida.
[00:52:12.453 --> 00:52:16.856]  It is absolutely clear that the Democrats are going to vote dead people.
[00:52:17.626 --> 00:52:19.926]  As they're doing right here in Clark County, Nevada.
[00:52:20.367 --> 00:52:22.907]  They're going to vote people multiple times.
[00:52:22.987 --> 00:52:28.408]  I was about to say, a bunch of state attorney generals have already found the Democrats voting twice, just as Trump warned they would.
[00:52:30.068 --> 00:52:33.989]  But this is an attempt, again, at inoculation.
[00:52:34.669 --> 00:52:41.450]  They intend to steal this and they're trying to signal Trump that he better not dare challenge their illegal actions.
[00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:45.491]  And therefore, I was actually trending on Twitter yesterday.
[00:52:46.461 --> 00:52:50.303]  That's a social media platform where I've been banned for over three years.
[00:52:51.463 --> 00:52:55.025]  But I want to be very clear because I went back and I listened to our interview.
[00:52:55.645 --> 00:53:01.948]  I never said the president should seize power if he's, you know, not elected.
[00:53:01.988 --> 00:53:11.212]  In fact, the president himself has said in a White House news conference, well, of course, if I lost an honest and fair election, I would step down.
[00:53:11.272 --> 00:53:12.613]  There's no question about that.
[00:53:13.573 --> 00:53:15.554]  But that's not what they are talking about.
[00:53:16.552 --> 00:53:18.533]  So this has to be corrected.
[00:53:18.873 --> 00:53:33.081]  The Guardian, CNN, the Daily Beast, all the usual suspects, all of the corporately owned fake news fountains, the people that constantly spew falsehoods about InfoWars, about you, about me.
[00:53:33.101 --> 00:53:41.746]  The reason they hate InfoWars and us so much is because we're letting people know what is really about to happen.
[00:53:42.779 --> 00:53:44.502]  We're exposing their plans.
[00:53:44.622 --> 00:53:46.645]  I was about to say they always project.
[00:53:46.765 --> 00:53:48.307]  They're the ones saying use the military.
[00:53:48.567 --> 00:53:52.253]  They're the ones saying they're going to lose and they're going to contest it and use that for civil unrest.
[00:53:52.533 --> 00:53:53.895]  They're the ones saying they want a coup.
[00:53:54.135 --> 00:53:56.439]  And then we're like, how do we respond to this criminal activity?
[00:53:56.719 --> 00:53:59.003]  And then you went to the Constitution and what the president should do.
[00:54:00.202 --> 00:54:10.884]  Well, not only that, but yes, I did say federal agents, in this case federal marshals, can impound ballots in states where there are disputes to ensure that there are no tampering with those ballots.
[00:54:11.364 --> 00:54:12.525]  That's called the law.
[00:54:12.705 --> 00:54:13.705]  That's how it works.
[00:54:14.625 --> 00:54:23.907]  So this hysteria is because we have tipped the American people, and perhaps the people around the President, into what is about to happen.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:40.087]  You notice in this interview that he gave with Judge Jeanine Pirro, someone I like very much, when she asked him about the potential for election fraud and stealing the 2020 election, the president said, we'll shut it down in a second.
[00:54:40.888 --> 00:54:42.488]  Well, I think that's optimistic.
[00:54:42.508 --> 00:54:46.429]  The President's not a lawyer, but it's more insidious than that.
[00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.490]  It's going to be multi-state.
[00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:51.031]  It's going to be multi-jurisdictional.
[00:54:51.491 --> 00:54:53.931]  It'll be in some courts, not in other courts.
[00:54:54.392 --> 00:54:59.453]  Meanwhile, how do we know that the BLM and TIFA forces
[00:55:00.143 --> 00:55:04.464]  Do not intend to intimidate voters from going to the polling places.
[00:55:05.164 --> 00:55:17.087]  I think that is exactly... Oh, by the way, the group Soros just set up to manage all this, the election transition team as they call it, publicly run by him, says we're gonna shut down all the cities, we're gonna shut down the polling places.
[00:55:17.107 --> 00:55:24.388]  They're actually saying they're gonna be there protecting them and then shutting them down and taking control and absolutely trying to lock down the country.
[00:55:25.289 --> 00:55:27.229]  There's a message for Attorney General Barr.
[00:55:28.044 --> 00:55:31.550]  Voter intimidation is a federal crime.
[00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.274]  They have just announced that they plan to do it.
[00:55:34.835 --> 00:55:36.938]  Sir, do your job.
[00:55:37.579 --> 00:55:38.981]  Please, do your job.
[00:55:40.433 --> 00:55:44.195]  When they say that we intimidate voters, it is baseless.
[00:55:44.695 --> 00:55:46.196]  We've never intimidated voters.
[00:55:46.236 --> 00:55:51.798]  In fact, I happen to think the bigger the turnout, the better it is for Donald Trump and the Republicans.
[00:55:52.299 --> 00:55:54.500]  But you're right, it's absolute projection.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.601]  Their criminal plans have been laid bare.
[00:55:58.322 --> 00:56:00.102]  They don't want any opposition.
[00:56:00.503 --> 00:56:08.006]  And when we go out there and we sound the clarion call so people know what is about to happen, they smear us.
[00:56:08.827 --> 00:56:09.507]  It's outrageous.
[00:56:10.219 --> 00:56:12.222]  Roger, when we come back, talk about outrageous.
[00:56:12.242 --> 00:56:21.658]  I keep hearing that Durham's going to do something and they've indicted one FBI lawyer that falsified documents about the president, about you, about others, with Russiagate garbage.
[00:56:23.254 --> 00:56:31.980]  Durham, I mean, we have 30-plus phones by the whole Mueller investigation being wiped, just like Hillary wiping the servers and bleach-bitting it.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:41.706]  The arrogance, the humorous of these people is just absolutely unparalleled because they think they're never going to get in trouble, which invites the next big scam.
[00:56:41.726 --> 00:56:43.527]  We'll come back to Roger Stone on the other side.
[00:56:43.547 --> 00:56:44.347]  He's out in Reno, Nevada.
[00:56:44.647 --> 00:56:45.808]  The President's giving his speech.
[00:56:46.389 --> 00:56:48.350]  There's so much more to get into here today.
[00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.651]  Roger Stone, of course.
[00:56:52.185 --> 00:56:53.226]  Has a lot of great websites.
[00:56:53.286 --> 00:56:54.927]  Roger, what's the best website for people to visit?
[00:56:55.328 --> 00:57:02.354]  These days, I think people should go to StoneColdTruth.com, where I am resuming broadcasting and reporting on American politics.
[00:57:02.414 --> 00:57:04.055]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:57:04.335 --> 00:57:07.298]  And just for listeners and viewers out there, we're burning the candle at both ends.
[00:57:07.318 --> 00:57:08.459]  We're up here seven days a week.
[00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:13.080]  Owen Schroer does a two-hour Sunday show now called Sunday Live.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.180]  Two hours right after this.
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.620]  Only six minutes of ads.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.020]  We're doing that right through the election.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.281]  The crew's working around the clock.
[00:57:18.321 --> 00:57:20.341]  So am I. We're doing the best job we can.
[00:57:20.381 --> 00:57:23.982]  This is the time to be involved and to spread the word about this live show.
[00:57:24.062 --> 00:57:31.223]  Take the live feed right now and email it, text message it, Twitter it, Facebook it, YouTube it, word of mouth it, and tell folks what the local station you're listening to.
[00:57:31.243 --> 00:57:32.523]  That isn't just important.
[00:57:32.583 --> 00:57:33.323]  It's everything.
[00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:35.764]  You are everything, Paul Revere.
[00:57:36.104 --> 00:57:37.364]  Tell folks about the show now.
[00:57:37.544 --> 00:57:38.124]  I know you are.
[00:57:39.902 --> 00:57:40.522]  50 days out.
[00:57:40.922 --> 00:57:42.223]  Look at the London Guardian headline.
[00:57:42.763 --> 00:57:44.004]  Roger Stone and Donald Trump.
[00:57:44.624 --> 00:57:46.644]  Bring in martial law if you lose election.
[00:57:47.705 --> 00:57:50.306]  Trump, meanwhile, promises to put down left-wing protests.
[00:57:50.826 --> 00:57:51.506]  Says U.S.
[00:57:51.566 --> 00:57:54.527]  Marshals killing Portland suspect was retribution.
[00:57:56.288 --> 00:57:57.308]  All of it out of context.
[00:57:57.468 --> 00:57:58.388]  All of it disinfo.
[00:57:58.929 --> 00:58:01.930]  It's the Democrats and the Deep State and their Chinese Communist backers.
[00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:07.231]  With Pelosi and Biden admitting they work for Communist China against America in open treason.
[00:58:08.012 --> 00:58:08.372]  Saying,
[00:58:09.793 --> 00:58:11.975]  That they're going to have the military remove Trump.
[00:58:12.375 --> 00:58:16.438]  And that if they lose, they're going to contest it and plunge the country into civil war.
[00:58:16.758 --> 00:58:30.748]  And John Podesta, two months ago, in the New York Times, in their war gaming, the highest levels of the Democratic Party said, we'll have liberal states secede, plunging us into the second American civil war, in Rob Reiner's own words.
[00:58:32.649 --> 00:58:36.932]  But then they turn it around and say, Roger Stone, he's the one doing it.
[00:58:39.167 --> 00:58:40.768]  Quote a word here, quote a word there.
[00:58:41.428 --> 00:58:47.591]  Yes, he used the word martial law because they brought us into a form of martial law where they're attacking police.
[00:58:47.951 --> 00:58:52.273]  What do you make of the Democrats celebrating two cops shot in L.A.
[00:58:52.313 --> 00:58:58.276]  for no reason, and then Black Lives Matter coming to the hospital and chanting and cheering and saying, we hope you die?
[00:58:58.296 --> 00:59:00.537]  And people say, well, this will never work.
[00:59:00.577 --> 00:59:02.638]  Well, it will work if people are intimidated.
[00:59:02.658 --> 00:59:04.198]  I mean, the police are already intimidated.
[00:59:04.259 --> 00:59:05.979]  Do you think about leftist demonstrators?
[00:59:05.999 --> 00:59:07.220]  Where do you see all this going, Roger?
[00:59:08.206 --> 00:59:27.822]  Well, first of all, I think the Department of Justice needs to lay out in a formal fashion the absolute indisputable ties between these left-wing violent groups in our streets and the Biden-Harris campaign and the central management of this socialist revolution in our streets.
[00:59:28.543 --> 00:59:33.527]  Because the Democrats are trying to act like, oh, that's not us, but it is them.
[00:59:34.107 --> 00:59:36.970]  I think it is a vast overplaying of their hand.
[00:59:37.575 --> 00:59:42.179]  And what I mean by that is I believe that they are galvanizing the silent majority.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:52.449]  They are intensifying the desire of Trump voters to vote and to go out and find others to do so.
[00:59:52.929 --> 00:59:56.793]  I detect among people I just speak to anecdotally,
[00:59:57.566 --> 00:59:59.887]  Uh, that there is growing support for the president.
[01:00:00.067 --> 01:00:02.448]  I believe he is gaining in this election.
[01:00:03.088 --> 01:00:13.932]  I believe people are reticent to tell that to a pollster they don't know or some person on the phone claiming to be a pollster that they don't know because they don't want to be harassed.
[01:00:14.512 --> 01:00:31.037]  I think particularly in the states like Wisconsin, in Michigan, where they have really raped and pillaged those communities, it is hurting them in the blue-collar, Catholic, Union, normally democratic suburbs.
[01:00:32.147 --> 01:00:37.031]  So I think in an odd way this is playing to the advantage of the president.
[01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:37.951]  I agree with you.
[01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:42.554]  I see it as part of the larger ongoing global realignment against the satanic left.
[01:00:43.015 --> 01:00:44.336]  But they're counter-striking.
[01:00:44.436 --> 01:00:47.138]  Why do you think Soros and the left did this card?
[01:00:47.178 --> 01:00:50.860]  Because it worked in Ukraine, worked in the Arab Spring, worked in other areas.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.242]  Why do they keep running the same communist playbook?
[01:00:54.182 --> 01:00:56.184]  Because it is born of frustration.
[01:00:56.284 --> 01:00:59.286]  You see, the Russian collusion hoax was so perfect.
[01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:04.732]  They had the full force and the authority of the United States Justice Department.
[01:01:05.612 --> 01:01:15.257]  They actually had authority vested in Robert Mueller to investigate anybody and anything he wanted, and he did.
[01:01:16.018 --> 01:01:27.804]  When Rod Rosenstein, the acting Attorney General, two weeks ago said, oh, I actually told Mueller not to investigate Trump's ties to Russia, and he never really did, that's a lie.
[01:01:28.672 --> 01:01:43.637]  He signed three scope memos that gave Mueller the broadest possible authority, and I can assure you, they went all over me, like a practice logical examination, and they were looking for Russians, or Russian connections, and they couldn't find any.
[01:01:44.397 --> 01:01:49.759]  This is not the first time Rosenstein has lied, but usually he lies under oath before Congress.
[01:01:50.319 --> 01:01:52.260]  I just asked the rhetorical question.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.960]  When will he be charged, Mr. Barr?
[01:01:55.561 --> 01:01:56.501]  When will he be charged?
[01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.306]  Well, that was my next question.
[01:01:58.346 --> 01:02:09.111]  What about the 30-plus missing phones of the entire Russia hoax group, the Russiagate coup d'etat group, handing their phones back classically wiped, some of them smashed?
[01:02:10.551 --> 01:02:17.754]  Destruction of evidence in a federal investigation is a felony with a 20-year penalty, Mr. Barr.
[01:02:19.251 --> 01:02:21.974]  I honestly, this is getting to the point of absurdity.
[01:02:22.234 --> 01:02:28.179]  By the way, Alex, this is not the first time that Mueller's dirty cops have destroyed evidence that would be useful.
[01:02:28.699 --> 01:02:31.942]  And then yesterday, you see, they're very clever.
[01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:47.874]  As soon as the story regarding Mueller's dirty cops, including Andrew Weissman, destroying the memories of the cell phones, hit the mainstream media, although I didn't see an NBC or CBS or ABC story on it.
[01:02:47.934 --> 01:02:48.455]  How about that?
[01:02:49.429 --> 01:03:04.767]  They immediately changed the narrative by leaking a story that one of John Durham's associate prosecutors has resigned reportedly to protest political pressure to speed up their investigation.
[01:03:05.228 --> 01:03:05.869]  Reportedly.
[01:03:06.684 --> 01:03:08.586]  No one has any confirmation of that.
[01:03:09.106 --> 01:03:14.590]  The woman prosecutor has denied that, or pardon me, she declines to confirm that.
[01:03:15.051 --> 01:03:23.598]  It's not in her resignation letter, but the purpose here was to get the story about Mueller's destruction of evidence, illegal, off the front page.
[01:03:23.618 --> 01:03:25.239]  Well obviously, here's my problem.
[01:03:25.499 --> 01:03:34.422]  It affects you, it's important, but if they're never going to do anything, it almost becomes, like Tucker Carlson has said, a distraction to keep saying, two more weeks, when is Durham going to do something?
[01:03:34.702 --> 01:03:43.425]  And then just more of their corruption keeps coming out, so it becomes a form of them just rubbing it into us, that they've done all this, and you know behind the scenes what they've been doing to me.
[01:03:43.745 --> 01:03:47.627]  I mean, I'm not a wimp, I can handle it, but my God, these people are raving criminals!
[01:03:48.567 --> 01:03:51.768]  Well, and the fact that we are this close to the election,
[01:03:52.646 --> 01:03:55.647]  ...gives the Democrats, sadly, a legitimate argument.
[01:03:55.667 --> 01:04:01.608]  I mean, traditionally, the Justice Department does not bring criminal indictments in a political matter.
[01:04:01.628 --> 01:04:02.909]  Sure, but tradition's out the window.
[01:04:02.929 --> 01:04:06.890]  They're talking about martial law and killing Trump and overthrowing him in the military.
[01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:10.991]  I mean, doesn't the Justice Department and Trump get they're not in Kansas anymore?
[01:04:11.011 --> 01:04:18.053]  That there is an internal criminal group allied with Communist China openly trying to overthrow the country and cause a damn civil war?
[01:04:19.504 --> 01:04:27.829]  No, when we say things like that, they think we are quote-unquote conspiracy theorists, when in fact they are the ones who are conspiracy theorists.
[01:04:28.469 --> 01:04:32.431]  They continue to say, Jake Tapper, this guy's a real piece of work.
[01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:35.793]  He had a special on CNN the other night on Russian collusion.
[01:04:36.693 --> 01:04:39.595]  This was one of the great golden oldie shows of all time.
[01:04:40.215 --> 01:04:42.657]  Hey Jake, there's no evidence whatsoever.
[01:04:42.777 --> 01:04:44.117]  Oh I know, they brought it all back.
[01:04:44.158 --> 01:04:45.778]  It's in the news that I'm a Russian again.
[01:04:45.798 --> 01:04:48.380]  I had a guy on the green belt call me a Russian two days ago.
[01:04:49.124 --> 01:04:57.728]  Paul Manafort was prosecuted for crimes that had nothing to do with Donald Trump, the 2016 election, or the Russians.
[01:04:58.088 --> 01:05:00.749]  General Flynn is innocent.
[01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:02.149]  It's indisputable.
[01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:03.270]  Roger Stone?
[01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:04.931]  I have no connection to the Russians.
[01:05:04.991 --> 01:05:08.852]  That was not among the bogus... And by the way, Roger, talk about electioneering.
[01:05:08.872 --> 01:05:10.453]  Look at how that judge, unprecedentedly,
[01:05:11.053 --> 01:05:15.915]  Won't let Flynn out of his conviction, even though they told him to reverse it, because it's a fraud.
[01:05:16.175 --> 01:05:17.615]  The judge just sits there for political reasons.
[01:05:17.795 --> 01:05:20.376]  Let's come back and talk about what Trump needs to do in the election.
[01:05:20.636 --> 01:05:33.080]  His big, incredible Nobel Peace Prize nominations, and how he really deserves it, and how Biden, I don't know if you saw this, had to admit, well, he accidentally got all these peace deals.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.821]  We'll talk about that on the other side with Roger Stone.
[01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:37.922]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com.
[01:05:39.577 --> 01:05:40.639]  And Infowars.com.
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:47.031]  And the globalists work around the clock to suppress those and censor those because it's like penicillin for a country that's got...
[01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:51.059]  A serious bacterial infection, and you're the white blood cells.
[01:05:51.379 --> 01:05:53.540]  You carry the information.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.801]  You carry the cure to it.
[01:05:55.901 --> 01:06:02.025]  So, everyone on local stations you're listening to, tell somebody at a store, at a red light right now, how you're listening.
[01:06:02.265 --> 01:06:03.746]  Call your wife, your husband, tell them to tune in.
[01:06:04.006 --> 01:06:04.946]  Tell your son, your daughter.
[01:06:05.207 --> 01:06:05.907]  Send out emails.
[01:06:05.927 --> 01:06:06.667]  Send out text messages.
[01:06:06.707 --> 01:06:07.368]  Get excited.
[01:06:07.408 --> 01:06:08.929]  Say, the forbidden show.
[01:06:09.229 --> 01:06:12.991]  What you're not supposed to hear, what they want to put people in prison for, is happening right now.
[01:06:13.111 --> 01:06:14.272]  Be the Paul Reveres.
[01:06:14.952 --> 01:06:16.793]  If you want to defeat them, you have to do it.
[01:06:17.033 --> 01:06:18.253]  This is not like regular elections.
[01:06:18.293 --> 01:06:20.094]  They get back in, folks, hell on earth.
[01:06:20.114 --> 01:06:20.694]  We'll talk about it.
[01:06:21.994 --> 01:06:23.975]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:24.075 --> 01:06:29.137]  It's Roger Stone and Alex Jones, 50 days out, where we were four years ago.
[01:06:29.757 --> 01:06:31.077]  Incredible times!
[01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:35.799]  The West and East Coast are collapsing, everyone's fleeing the leftists, but they
[01:06:36.852 --> 01:06:41.994]  Trump's got a lot of people still in his orbit that are non-confrontationalist.
[01:06:42.014 --> 01:06:43.034]  What was the word you used?
[01:06:54.949 --> 01:06:55.269]  Wimps.
[01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:56.511]  That's the name.
[01:06:56.551 --> 01:06:57.172]  Pussycats.
[01:06:57.913 --> 01:06:59.755]  And look, we don't want to be in that orbit.
[01:07:00.576 --> 01:07:01.758]  We're trying to save the country.
[01:07:02.058 --> 01:07:03.320]  What is your advice to the President?
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.744]  You were telling me during the break, you actually think he's a little bit behind right now, but gaining.
[01:07:07.244 --> 01:07:09.828]  You think the Democrats are going to win right now via fraud or what?
[01:07:10.643 --> 01:07:15.286]  Well, if the election were held today, I do think they would win, although mostly through fraud.
[01:07:15.846 --> 01:07:20.949]  I do think the president is slightly behind, but the momentum is with him.
[01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.750]  He is gaining.
[01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:32.096]  That's largely because he's back out on the stump and because they have badly overplayed their hand with this violence in a number of American cities.
[01:07:33.096 --> 01:07:35.898]  But Alex, you made a point that I have to come back to.
[01:07:36.943 --> 01:07:41.126]  What's going on in the Flynn case is one of the most outrageous things I have ever seen.
[01:07:41.966 --> 01:08:03.359]  Judge Sullivan, Emmett Sullivan, does not have the legal authority to appoint a special counsel, does not have the legal authority to decide whether General Flynn should now be charged with different crimes, because he folded to extraordinary... This is unprecedented, it's an overthrow of the Constitution on its face.
[01:08:04.519 --> 01:08:21.195]  And earlier in the trial, you may remember that Sullivan excoriated Flynn from the bench, called him a traitor, saying that he had worked for the Turkish government while in the employ of the United States government as National Security Advisor, which is not true.
[01:08:21.735 --> 01:08:30.383]  So he has demonstrated his bias against a genuine American war hero, a man who saved lives on the battlefield.
[01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.006]  Yet the appeals court in D.C.
[01:08:33.066 --> 01:08:36.589]  says that Sullivan does nothing to show his bias.
[01:08:37.089 --> 01:08:39.632]  This man is a disgrace to the federal bench.
[01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:41.613]  He's not the only one in the D.C.
[01:08:41.633 --> 01:08:41.994]  circuit.
[01:08:42.414 --> 01:08:44.356]  But if Republicans win the House,
[01:08:45.186 --> 01:08:54.113]  There must be impeachment proceedings against a number of these judicial tyrants who think that they are not bound by the law or the Constitution.
[01:08:54.554 --> 01:08:58.577]  They're only doing it by... Obviously, there's a power grab by Democrats, period.
[01:08:58.637 --> 01:08:59.538]  They know they're losing.
[01:08:59.558 --> 01:09:00.699]  There's a political realignment.
[01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:07.785]  So they're trying to bring in an authoritarianism, a censorship, and a judicial tyranny to enforce their power to then extinct the Republican Party.
[01:09:08.325 --> 01:09:14.233]  And the only question is, do Trump, Mitch McConnell, and all these Rand Paul get the existential crisis we're in?
[01:09:14.454 --> 01:09:15.275]  Do they not get it?
[01:09:16.997 --> 01:09:18.299]  Some do, some don't.
[01:09:18.379 --> 01:09:19.080]  Let me say this.
[01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:22.365]  If you go to magapetitions.org
[01:09:23.447 --> 01:09:28.971]  There's a great petition there to sign for a pardon for General Flynn, to end what they're doing to him.
[01:09:29.071 --> 01:09:30.332]  I've been through this personally.
[01:09:30.732 --> 01:09:32.494]  I know how excruciating it is.
[01:09:32.894 --> 01:09:35.236]  I know how difficult it is on a person's family.
[01:09:35.616 --> 01:09:38.838]  So go to magapetitions.org and just sign the petition.
[01:09:39.219 --> 01:09:39.739]  It's free.
[01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:46.924]  But we want to get a million people to tell the President, it's time to end this circus and pardon this great American hero.
[01:09:46.984 --> 01:09:47.545]  Absolutely.
[01:09:47.585 --> 01:09:48.766]  And you know, what about Assange?
[01:09:48.906 --> 01:09:51.628]  I mean, this is the guy that Trump said, yeah, WikiLeaks has it, release it.
[01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:56.937]  You've got Snowden has been exonerated, and Trump needs to do this.
[01:09:57.358 --> 01:09:59.700]  He needs to put you up on the stage front and center at rallies.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.242]  He needs to pardon Snowden.
[01:10:02.282 --> 01:10:03.443]  He needs to pardon Assange.
[01:10:03.803 --> 01:10:05.124]  That's what America wants to see.
[01:10:05.444 --> 01:10:06.605]  Let's move on to the good news.
[01:10:07.806 --> 01:10:18.394]  How does Biden spend this to say Trump accidentally gets an Israeli-Bahrain, Israeli-UAE, Serbia-Kosovo deal, stops the big crisis with North Korea?
[01:10:18.775 --> 01:10:19.756]  I mean, this is real
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:28.003]  No, it's actual statecraft.
[01:10:28.503 --> 01:10:33.486]  This is where I give the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, well-deserved credit.
[01:10:34.066 --> 01:10:37.127]  He's worked very hard on a viable peace deal.
[01:10:37.688 --> 01:10:39.148]  He deserves credit for that.
[01:10:39.789 --> 01:10:51.094]  There is no other American president who could have done this, because the Israelis trust Donald Trump, and the Saudis trust Donald Trump, and therefore he is able to bring everyone together.
[01:10:51.883 --> 01:10:57.306]  You notice the story about him being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize appeared almost nowhere.
[01:10:58.267 --> 01:10:59.848]  It appeared in conservative media.
[01:11:00.488 --> 01:11:01.669]  Didn't see it on NBC.
[01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:02.529]  Isn't that strange?
[01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:14.877]  Yet, if you go back and look at the coverage, when Obama was nominated for such a prize, on the basis of what I can't figure out, it was front page news everywhere in America.
[01:11:15.377 --> 01:11:17.939]  It was an extraordinary historical happening.
[01:11:18.639 --> 01:11:19.860]  It's really quite incredible.
[01:11:21.101 --> 01:11:25.290]  Well, pulling back from this, Obama wasn't in office yet when he was given the Peace Prize.
[01:11:25.651 --> 01:11:28.878]  Then he launched a bunch of wars and expanded the Arab Spring in a bunch of horror.
[01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:31.042]  But the mere fact that...
[01:11:32.639 --> 01:11:44.768]  Trump goes out and does this, and not only did the two nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize get ignored, but the peace deals pretty much get ignored, but then when Biden does respond, again, I want your response to this, he says, oh, he did it by accident.
[01:11:44.829 --> 01:11:54.516]  So, he's incompetent, he beat the whole political system, never running for office, and is a maverick, and now he keeps, and he turned the economy around, and Krugman said it would never hit 3%, no magic wand, went to 3.8.
[01:11:55.938 --> 01:11:57.421]  And now he gets all these peace deals.
[01:11:57.862 --> 01:12:01.549]  Wow, so this horrible, incompetent idiot has just defeated all these people.
[01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:04.055]  That means they are lower than whale crap.
[01:12:05.171 --> 01:12:09.933]  Well, it is just very typical of the elitism of Joe Biden.
[01:12:10.013 --> 01:12:25.659]  Look, before he was slipping mentally, he was a loudmouth, blowhard, braggart, wrong about virtually every foreign policy issue during his time in the Senate, took credit for things he had nothing whatsoever to do with.
[01:12:26.099 --> 01:12:28.119]  For example, I marched with Dr. King.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.940]  Hey Joe, no you didn't.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:30.920]  That's BS.
[01:12:31.421 --> 01:12:32.101]  Very typical.
[01:12:32.902 --> 01:12:39.668]  But now that he is slipping mentally, and I think that's a fair thing to say, he has not lost that elitism.
[01:12:40.048 --> 01:12:45.314]  See, they look down on Donald Trump just like they look down on the people who voted for him.
[01:12:46.054 --> 01:12:48.176]  They're smarter than we are, the elites.
[01:12:48.717 --> 01:12:52.801]  We have no business even having an opinion about how the country should be governed.
[01:12:53.856 --> 01:12:59.781]  And we both understand that Donald Trump is an interruption in the war continuum.
[01:12:59.861 --> 01:13:03.584]  In other words, it didn't matter whether our presidents were Republicans or Democrats.
[01:13:03.604 --> 01:13:04.405]  It was immaterial.
[01:13:04.865 --> 01:13:07.267]  Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama.
[01:13:07.848 --> 01:13:11.891]  Endless foreign war where our inherent national interests were never clear.
[01:13:12.331 --> 01:13:14.213]  There's always a problem with globalism.
[01:13:14.233 --> 01:13:16.255]  Let me raise this because get into Donald Trump's character.
[01:13:16.895 --> 01:13:20.058]  The fact that when he straight shoots on a business deal, they always call him a liar.
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.801]  They know he actually does what he says he'll do.
[01:13:22.841 --> 01:13:25.822]  Talk about Trump's psychology and what he really wants.
[01:13:25.862 --> 01:13:27.023]  They say it's just green money.
[01:13:27.063 --> 01:13:27.643]  I don't believe that.
[01:13:28.023 --> 01:13:35.407]  I understand that Trump has a larger destiny, a larger view, but these foreign leaders know that when Trump tells them something, that's what he really thinks.
[01:13:35.527 --> 01:13:36.667]  Everybody knows that about Trump.
[01:13:36.967 --> 01:13:37.868]  Isn't that refreshing?
[01:13:37.908 --> 01:13:39.228]  Isn't that what people want?
[01:13:40.329 --> 01:13:48.853]  Well, and to the extent that the president thinks about his legacy, and I'm sure he does, what greater legacy could you have than Peacemaker?
[01:13:49.986 --> 01:13:53.147]  Donald Trump ran for president as an anti-war candidate.
[01:13:53.627 --> 01:13:56.909]  It was the most important plank in his platform.
[01:13:57.369 --> 01:14:11.954]  The American people were tired of spending billions and losing the lives of men and women in these endless foreign wars that were used by the Bushes not to fight for democracy, but to fight for either oil or for political advantage.
[01:14:12.435 --> 01:14:13.575]  The people were fed up with it.
[01:14:14.298 --> 01:14:20.180]  At every step during his administration, which the president has tried to keep his promise to withdraw our troops.
[01:14:20.601 --> 01:14:23.902]  Shouldn't the left be bending over backwards to support Trump?
[01:14:23.922 --> 01:14:24.902]  They're now the war party.
[01:14:25.182 --> 01:14:27.563]  I see national polls that Democrats want more war now.
[01:14:28.524 --> 01:14:29.424]  Yeah, there's no question.
[01:14:30.144 --> 01:14:31.165]  Everything is backwards.
[01:14:31.445 --> 01:14:33.606]  The Democrats were once big on civil liberties.
[01:14:34.146 --> 01:14:36.487]  Now they love the FBI spying on everybody.
[01:14:37.003 --> 01:14:38.884]  The Democrats used to be against war.
[01:14:39.305 --> 01:14:42.887]  Now they think foreign war is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[01:14:44.168 --> 01:14:46.650]  They used to be against censorship.
[01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:49.552]  Now, Alex Jones, we've got to censor him.
[01:14:49.933 --> 01:14:53.255]  We can't let him speak because we can't defeat his ideas.
[01:14:53.815 --> 01:14:56.437]  We can't even compete with his ideas.
[01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:57.818]  So we've got to shut him up.
[01:14:58.439 --> 01:14:59.259]  They're fascists.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.921]  That's really what it comes down to.
[01:15:01.741 --> 01:15:03.923]  None worse than Twitter and Facebook.
[01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.124]  These people are hypocrites.
[01:15:06.038 --> 01:15:07.519]  But we're winning anyway.
[01:15:07.579 --> 01:15:08.800]  There's the irony of it.
[01:15:09.161 --> 01:15:11.883]  Because you cannot stop the power of an idea.
[01:15:11.903 --> 01:15:15.805]  And because Donald Trump, thank God, has the bully pulpit.
[01:15:16.526 --> 01:15:17.687]  And they can't silence him.
[01:15:18.419 --> 01:15:22.102]  And he speaks from the heart and he understands where the people are.
[01:15:22.582 --> 01:15:24.764]  The people are tired of these riots in our cities.
[01:15:25.344 --> 01:15:26.645]  They're tired of the violence.
[01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:28.806]  They're tired of the lies.
[01:15:29.327 --> 01:15:31.028]  They're tired of the foreign wars.
[01:15:31.989 --> 01:15:33.129]  They really are fed up.
[01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:36.192]  I think the silent majority is gaining in strength.
[01:15:36.352 --> 01:15:36.932]  No, I agree.
[01:15:36.972 --> 01:15:37.993]  Roger Stone's on fire.
[01:15:38.013 --> 01:15:39.594]  I was letting him go now, but he's got some time.
[01:15:39.614 --> 01:15:43.097]  We're going to do one more segment and then this show ends and Owen Schroeder takes over with...
[01:15:44.037 --> 01:15:46.379]  Sunday live, only six minutes of ads.
[01:15:46.799 --> 01:15:48.280]  You'll get a lot of calls, special guests.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.861]  I'm gonna ask Roger then, because I know these messages get to Trump.
[01:15:52.182 --> 01:15:53.623]  And by the way, I said he's in Reno.
[01:15:53.663 --> 01:15:55.264]  They're in Las Vegas tonight, excuse me.
[01:15:57.065 --> 01:15:58.106]  Teleprompter free, folks.
[01:15:58.226 --> 01:15:59.527]  I never lie to you.
[01:15:59.767 --> 01:16:01.068]  Consciously, I do make mistakes.
[01:16:01.428 --> 01:16:02.649]  He's in Las Vegas.
[01:16:03.069 --> 01:16:04.110]  Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.530]  Stay with us.
[01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:10.539]  Roger Stone is live from Las Vegas, Nevada, while Trump's giving his speech.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:15.382]  Doing a lot of intel there, a lot of research, a lot of meetings coming up tonight.
[01:16:18.244 --> 01:16:19.264]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:16:19.745 --> 01:16:27.429]  Coming up, Owen Troyer and Sunday live for two hours on the local radio stations of Vegas and of course at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:30.271]  Roger, I've never had cancer, thank God.
[01:16:31.527 --> 01:16:35.195]  But I've watched family die of it, and I see the battle against it.
[01:16:35.295 --> 01:16:41.949]  And I would describe globalism, the New World Order, just the pedophiles of the left.
[01:16:43.232 --> 01:16:43.932]  as cancer.
[01:16:44.713 --> 01:16:45.853]  He doesn't have a consciousness.
[01:16:45.894 --> 01:16:46.854]  He just wants to kill.
[01:16:47.494 --> 01:16:49.095]  And I see America fighting cancer.
[01:16:49.135 --> 01:16:50.996]  As you say, oh, the Democrats are desperate.
[01:16:51.396 --> 01:16:53.918]  That's why they're cheering for dead cops and shot cops.
[01:16:53.998 --> 01:16:57.820]  And that's why they want the country to fall and chanting death to America.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.120]  That's not far left.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.501]  That's the mainline Democrats now.
[01:17:00.561 --> 01:17:01.142]  I'm around them.
[01:17:01.482 --> 01:17:01.962]  I see them.
[01:17:01.982 --> 01:17:02.762]  They're mentally ill.
[01:17:03.183 --> 01:17:10.887]  And I see a huge awakening of Hispanic Americans, black Americans, Catholic blue collar workers, as you said, and in the Rust Belt, purple states.
[01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:14.752]  So then we should be winning by a giant landslide despite fraud.
[01:17:15.474 --> 01:17:17.677]  So you're saying, hey, the globalists are desperate.
[01:17:17.777 --> 01:17:18.298]  I agree.
[01:17:18.839 --> 01:17:19.821]  But then you look at the numbers.
[01:17:19.861 --> 01:17:20.782]  We're neck and neck here.
[01:17:20.823 --> 01:17:23.227]  And I've never had so much.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.462]  So much concern.
[01:17:27.982 --> 01:17:30.104]  The suspense, you can cut it with a damn knife.
[01:17:30.164 --> 01:17:33.867]  I mean, I am in just absolute berserker mode right now.
[01:17:34.828 --> 01:17:35.689]  I feel desperate.
[01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:36.809]  I feel like I should be doing more.
[01:17:36.829 --> 01:17:39.752]  I feel like I should be working 24 hours a day, but then I get exhausted.
[01:17:40.112 --> 01:17:42.174]  And then I see the same panic in the enemy.
[01:17:42.534 --> 01:17:43.795]  This is not a normal election.
[01:17:43.835 --> 01:17:46.577]  This is existential good versus evil crisis.
[01:17:46.817 --> 01:17:47.458]  Do you agree with that?
[01:17:48.599 --> 01:17:49.700]  I absolutely do.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:53.583]  I think there are three factors that are reflected in these polls.
[01:17:54.315 --> 01:18:00.420]  First and foremost, of course, is the intimidation factor.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:08.707]  The fact that because of the activities of an unhinged, corporately owned fake news media, people are afraid
[01:18:09.378 --> 01:18:16.063]  Yeah, there's that bullying overhang that you'll get shot or killed or screamed at.
[01:18:16.223 --> 01:18:18.504]  People watch BLM go into restaurants and attack families.
[01:18:18.744 --> 01:18:20.766]  We go, that'll turn them... No, no, that's intimidation.
[01:18:20.986 --> 01:18:21.967]  They think we're wimps.
[01:18:22.027 --> 01:18:23.548]  They think America... That's it.
[01:18:23.828 --> 01:18:26.169]  I don't think America will buy this type of intimidation.
[01:18:26.389 --> 01:18:29.211]  I expect us all to come together and throw these bullies off of us!
[01:18:39.551 --> 01:18:47.954]  Trump supporters, in fact, anybody who isn't a liberal on the social media platforms, which is impacting voter perception.
[01:18:48.794 --> 01:18:53.696]  And then lastly, of course, is the constant barrage of disinformation.
[01:18:54.056 --> 01:18:54.917]  Just lies.
[01:18:55.337 --> 01:18:58.498]  Let's take the Atlantic Magazine article, for example.
[01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:08.487]  First of all, the author of this article, Jeff Goldberg, has a long and colorful history of being completely dishonest and fabricating his reports.
[01:19:08.507 --> 01:19:12.173]  He's known as the King Daddy of the Iraq War that killed millions.
[01:19:13.234 --> 01:19:31.326]  Secondarily, having read the Atlantic Magazine coverage of my own trial, it was rife with inaccuracies, outrout lies, and when they reproduced actual screenshots of certain text messages, they edited them.
[01:19:31.706 --> 01:19:33.388]  So they weren't even authentic.
[01:19:33.488 --> 01:19:37.330]  They edited them to fit the false narrative of their story.
[01:19:37.410 --> 01:19:38.611]  It's absolutely outrageous.
[01:19:38.831 --> 01:19:41.153]  So what happens when the Democrats lose?
[01:19:41.233 --> 01:19:42.574]  And I believe they're going to lose
[01:19:43.414 --> 01:19:44.556]  Because of our prayer and action.
[01:19:44.576 --> 01:19:45.416]  What do they do next?
[01:19:45.436 --> 01:19:49.401]  Because I used to ask Gavin McInnes what peak craziness is, Roger.
[01:19:49.681 --> 01:19:51.583]  I don't think there is any peak craziness.
[01:19:52.104 --> 01:19:53.205]  Uh, peak craziness.
[01:19:53.465 --> 01:19:55.187]  I just think they get crazier and crazier forever.
[01:19:56.228 --> 01:20:05.298]  Well, I think they will step up these violent assaults in our cities, which, and they've already announced their intention to move to the suburbs where our voters live.
[01:20:06.187 --> 01:20:12.029]  Secondarily, you will have the same new investigations.
[01:20:12.049 --> 01:20:14.650]  It depends, of course, who wins either House of Congress.
[01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:19.471]  If the Democrats retain the House, you'll have yet another impeachment.
[01:20:19.491 --> 01:20:20.452]  That was my next question.
[01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:24.353]  If the Democrats win this by fraud, Katie, bar the door.
[01:20:26.124 --> 01:20:37.431]  If the Democrats win this by fraud, then there will be an attempt to prosecute people like myself, like you, many others who have committed no crimes other than opposing them.
[01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:51.615]  Media Matters for America keeps criticizing you and I from using a quote in which Kamala Harris actually openly says, there will be revenge against those who supported Trump and enabled his presidency.
[01:20:51.996 --> 01:20:54.877]  We will leave no stone unturned, she said.
[01:20:55.357 --> 01:20:56.937]  Who could she be talking about?
[01:20:57.617 --> 01:21:02.239]  So this is a, this is a fight, not just for the future of the United States.
[01:21:02.939 --> 01:21:05.440]  This is a fight for the future of Western civilization.
[01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:12.823]  This is an epic struggle between dark and light, between good and evil, between the godly and the godless.
[01:21:13.823 --> 01:21:18.884]  Being in politics, you know, every couple of years we say, this is the most important election of our lifetimes.
[01:21:19.604 --> 01:21:21.464]  But this time, it really is.
[01:21:22.265 --> 01:21:32.667]  And the president must be re-elected to stop this country from hurtling over the cliff to atheistic, godless globalism mastered by the socialists.
[01:21:33.083 --> 01:21:33.503]  Well, that's right.
[01:21:33.543 --> 01:21:36.464]  In closing, Roger, I appreciate all the time tonight while you're there in Las Vegas, not Reno.
[01:21:36.484 --> 01:21:37.084]  That was last night.
[01:21:39.985 --> 01:21:41.045]  Obviously, we're wargaming.
[01:21:41.065 --> 01:21:44.006]  They don't want us wargaming when they say they're going to try to steal the election.
[01:21:44.026 --> 01:21:45.506]  They're trying to get the military to have a coup.
[01:21:45.986 --> 01:21:47.406]  They're openly saying it all over.
[01:21:47.446 --> 01:21:50.967]  Then you go, well, Trump better counter their martial law with martial law.
[01:21:51.227 --> 01:21:52.207]  That's a normal response.
[01:21:52.227 --> 01:21:54.368]  They take us there in the threat continuum.
[01:21:54.948 --> 01:21:56.488]  That's default constitution.
[01:21:56.688 --> 01:21:57.289]  We don't want that.
[01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:58.709]  We're going to win fair and square.
[01:21:59.429 --> 01:22:01.210]  Clearly they don't want you advising the president.
[01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:10.235]  So spend two minutes on what you think the president should do or how we should war game what he does when they purposely say the election is contested when he's clearly won.
[01:22:11.206 --> 01:22:12.907]  Well, first of all, let's talk pre-election.
[01:22:13.027 --> 01:22:30.960]  You will recall that I was deeply involved in an effort called Stop the Steal that was focused on the Republican National Convention, because I was confident that the Ted Cruz forces, when they aligned with the Bush forces and the... And you were right, and they tried and you stopped them.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.101]  And we stopped them.
[01:22:32.859 --> 01:22:43.810]  Now I think what the Republican National Committee, which is basically useless, should be doing is putting together a volunteer brigade of attorneys.
[01:22:44.697 --> 01:23:04.257]  Uh, in every state who are well-versed in election law, who are very familiar with the state system, who are prepared to assert their rights on behalf of the Republican nominees to inspect ballots, to inspect the process, and to file objections and, if necessary, lawsuits.
[01:23:04.817 --> 01:23:13.482]  There are already 600 lawyers signed up for Biden to do this, most of them veterans of the Obama Justice Department.
[01:23:14.402 --> 01:23:19.605]  Hillary has said it is their policy to contest because they know they're going to lose.
[01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:25.448]  Well, Hillary said under no circumstances should Joe Biden ever concede, even if he loses.
[01:23:26.132 --> 01:23:41.680]  But she hasn't gotten the kind of criticism today that I got by simply saying the president should exercise his legal rights in his authority as president if there is overwhelming evidence that this election has been stolen through voter fraud.
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.941]  Sorry folks, there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:23:44.637 --> 01:23:48.618]  Never mind the Guardian or CNN or the twerps at the RNC.
[01:23:48.658 --> 01:23:50.018]  No, they're just mad that we get it.
[01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:53.379]  But obviously, more and more, the White House gets this.
[01:23:54.379 --> 01:23:56.499]  And Hillary's like, oh, they got a bunch of lawyers.
[01:23:56.559 --> 01:23:58.300]  No, the Republicans don't have any lawyers right now.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.660]  They need to be on the ground.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.940]  How does the RNC do that?
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:04.761]  Because you're right, the RNC just doesn't want MSNBC to talk bad about them.
[01:24:04.981 --> 01:24:07.301]  They are the weakest, most pathetic Republicans there are.
[01:24:08.781 --> 01:24:11.822]  We are completely unprepared for an election challenge.
[01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:15.542]  Say what you want about James A. Baker III.
[01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:22.165]  The Republicans so completely outmaneuvered and out-organized the Democrats in 2000.
[01:24:23.146 --> 01:24:28.168]  But we are completely unprepared for what is about to happen, and time is short.
[01:24:28.648 --> 01:24:41.634]  So I am hopeful that some of the more prominent Republicans in the country, who do understand the problem, I should say Republican lawyers in the country, will put together a completely volunteer operation
[01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:43.932]  This is very important, Alex.
[01:24:44.452 --> 01:24:46.433]  Not to intimidate voters.
[01:24:46.813 --> 01:24:48.094]  That's not what we're proposing.
[01:24:48.474 --> 01:24:56.539]  But to examine the process and the ballots and the legality of what happens both before the election and on election day.
[01:24:56.579 --> 01:24:57.099]  Well, absolutely.
[01:24:57.119 --> 01:24:59.760]  The Democrats say they're going to challenge it because they know they're losing.
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:02.822]  They're pumping 80 million pretty much fake ballots in to confuse it.
[01:25:02.862 --> 01:25:04.903]  Dead cats are getting ballots.
[01:25:05.043 --> 01:25:06.324]  And that's normal.
[01:25:06.384 --> 01:25:06.964]  That's good.
[01:25:07.064 --> 01:25:08.865]  And we should call for integrity.
[01:25:09.145 --> 01:25:09.926]  But Zuckerberg
[01:25:11.107 --> 01:25:23.944]  And Bloomberg are spending together $600 million now, $200 million one, $400 million another, to go out and fund saying the election is illegitimate when Trump wins.
[01:25:24.184 --> 01:25:25.145]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:25:25.305 --> 01:25:26.387]  You talk about election meddling.
[01:25:28.187 --> 01:25:29.728]  This is one of the things that they object to.
[01:25:29.908 --> 01:25:39.195]  I said, if there is actual proof that Zuckerberg has been involved in electoral fraud, then he should be arrested and prosecuted.
[01:25:39.235 --> 01:25:40.276]  Yes, I did say that.
[01:25:40.576 --> 01:25:41.036]  Guess what?
[01:25:41.257 --> 01:25:41.637]  I'm right!
[01:25:42.324 --> 01:25:43.945]  But they leave out the if part.
[01:25:44.425 --> 01:25:52.669]  Stone says Zuckerberg should be arrested, as if I'm proposing preventive detention, which I very specifically said I was opposed to.
[01:25:52.849 --> 01:25:55.070]  So it is, it's the constant distortion.
[01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:59.372]  Well, Sacha Baron Cohen said if he doesn't hand the election to the UN, we'll arrest him.
[01:25:59.433 --> 01:26:00.953]  So we're already in that wheelhouse.
[01:26:00.993 --> 01:26:02.754]  Roger Stone, powerful hour-long interview.
[01:26:03.154 --> 01:26:04.355]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:26:04.395 --> 01:26:04.995]  Thank you so much.
[01:26:05.015 --> 01:26:06.136]  We'll talk to you again soon, my friend.
[01:26:06.789 --> 01:26:07.389]  Great to be here.
[01:26:07.429 --> 01:26:08.189]  Many thanks, Alex.
[01:26:08.249 --> 01:26:08.609]  Thank you.
[01:26:08.649 --> 01:26:08.869]  Wow.
[01:26:08.909 --> 01:26:09.490]  Powerful interview.
[01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:10.030]  All right.
[01:26:10.050 --> 01:26:10.690]  The show's over.
[01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:11.510]  30 seconds.
[01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:12.530]  Owen Schroer comes in here.
[01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:17.011]  There's two hours, six minutes, an hour of commercials for local stations.
[01:26:17.031 --> 01:26:17.391]  That's it.
[01:26:17.731 --> 01:26:19.892]  Please tell folks about Sunday Live, Owen Schroer.
[01:26:20.192 --> 01:26:21.212]  That's how we reach new people.
[01:26:21.252 --> 01:26:21.732]  You're awake.
[01:26:21.952 --> 01:26:22.412]  You're informed.
[01:26:22.432 --> 01:26:22.972]  You know all this.
[01:26:23.493 --> 01:26:29.754]  Send it to your mom, your brother, your cousin, your whole email list, your whole Twitter feed, your whole YouTube, your whole Google, your whole Facebook.
[01:26:30.214 --> 01:26:30.796]  Call people.
[01:26:30.836 --> 01:26:31.497]  Text message it.
[01:26:31.537 --> 01:26:32.699]  Just get people to tune in.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.267]  They don't want this show on air because we're so effective and we tell the truth.
[01:26:36.507 --> 01:26:37.189]  God bless you all.
[01:26:37.209 --> 01:26:38.171]  I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[01:26:38.431 --> 01:26:39.132]  Great job the crew.
[01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:40.215]  I'll see you back live 11 a.m.
[01:26:40.235 --> 01:26:40.736]  tomorrow Central.
[01:26:41.766 --> 01:26:45.147]  This is going to come down to fighting over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[01:26:45.167 --> 01:26:46.308]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:26:46.328 --> 01:26:47.888]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[01:26:48.068 --> 01:26:49.429]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[01:26:49.549 --> 01:26:50.549]  I want them shut down.
[01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:51.510]  I want them silenced.
[01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:52.270]  I want them muted.
[01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:54.211]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:26:54.251 --> 01:26:55.151]  You kept us on air.
[01:26:55.291 --> 01:26:56.592]  We did the analysis first.
[01:26:56.872 --> 01:26:57.852]  It's now gone mainstream.
[01:26:57.932 --> 01:26:59.733]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[01:27:00.013 --> 01:27:05.915]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[01:27:06.115 --> 01:27:07.556]  And you need to stop right now.
[01:27:07.676 --> 01:27:08.736]  And they're very, very serious.
[01:27:08.876 --> 01:27:11.257]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[01:27:11.357 --> 01:27:12.157]  It's not going to happen.
[01:27:12.177 --> 01:27:14.077]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[01:27:14.558 --> 01:27:17.018]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[01:27:17.078 --> 01:27:18.718]  Save yourself, save the world.
[01:27:19.038 --> 01:27:19.898]  We're in this together.
[01:27:20.239 --> 01:27:21.939]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:27:21.979 --> 01:27:25.799]  Communism's up here, InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.000]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.760]  My children are right here!
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.201]  But I need money to fight a war!
[01:27:32.441 --> 01:27:33.501]  And I need word of mouth!
[01:27:33.701 --> 01:27:34.601]  And I need prayer!
[01:27:34.761 --> 01:27:35.721]  And I need action!
[01:27:36.101 --> 01:27:37.661]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[01:27:38.382 --> 01:27:40.342]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[01:27:40.962 --> 01:27:45.344]  I talk to the EMS and I talk to medical doctors, and what makes you nauseated, it's not just the smell of piss.
[01:27:45.364 --> 01:27:46.905]  We call the smell of bum piss.
[01:27:47.245 --> 01:27:48.906]  It has this sweet, nauseating smell.
[01:27:48.926 --> 01:27:49.847]  It's on the face.
[01:27:49.907 --> 01:27:54.529]  All it does, it's a sweet, it's a sweet stench like you wanna throw up, like rotten meat.
[01:27:54.549 --> 01:27:56.210]  It is, it is the crap of dust mites.
[01:27:56.653 --> 01:28:00.795]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist-run neighborhoods?
[01:28:01.155 --> 01:28:07.699]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing, and InfoWars Store has the solution.
[01:28:07.899 --> 01:28:20.346]  InfoWars has created the most powerful herbal lung cleanse and respiratory support product on the market, with over a thousand types of mold and mildew, toxic chemicals, and yes, dust mites.
[01:28:20.786 --> 01:28:23.127]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[01:28:23.147 --> 01:28:24.708]  This is taken under the tongue
[01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:49.231]  It is pure turmeric.
[01:28:50.212 --> 01:28:58.921]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[01:28:59.442 --> 01:29:07.470]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:10.753]  The two formulas are different but both are concentrates
[01:29:10.973 --> 01:29:11.233]  I think so.
[01:29:41.345 --> 01:29:42.367]  It's finally here!
[01:29:43.008 --> 01:29:46.693]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[01:29:47.114 --> 01:29:49.257]  Available now for 33% off at InfoWareStore.com
[01:29:53.473 --> 01:30:02.915]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive Deep Earth Crystal Nascent Iodine.

[01:30:40.754 --> 01:30:46.078]  This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the annual purge.
[01:30:48.763 --> 01:30:53.586]  At the siren, all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 hours.
[01:30:54.007 --> 01:30:56.468]  Your government thanks you for your participation.
[01:31:02.152 --> 01:31:04.314]  We played a lot of purge games this evening.
[01:31:04.994 --> 01:31:05.915]  We have just one more.
[01:31:05.935 --> 01:31:08.517]  It's called Mommy's Choice.
[01:31:08.917 --> 01:31:12.239]  Which one of you will survive this year's purge?
[01:31:14.619 --> 01:31:16.961]  The soul of our country is at stake.
[01:31:17.302 --> 01:31:24.209]  The Purge targets the poor and the innocent.
[01:31:24.269 --> 01:31:28.874]  Blessed be America for letting this purge and cleanse our souls.
[01:31:29.395 --> 01:31:32.258]  Join me as we eliminate evil.
[01:31:32.878 --> 01:31:35.101]  Purge and kill!
[01:31:35.161 --> 01:31:36.102]  Purge and kill!
