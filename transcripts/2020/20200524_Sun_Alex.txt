[00:00:06.358 --> 00:00:18.268]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.630]  It is Sunday, May 24th, the year is 2020.
[00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.353]  We are 162 days out from this historic election.
[00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:27.216]  162 days out from this historic election.
[00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:46.296]  If you are a TV viewer, a radio listener, you have to understand that when I say that you are the Paul Reveres in this fight, that is not to patronize you or pat you on the head and make you feel important.
[00:00:46.296 --> 00:01:00.087]  It is because obviously you are extremely important with 162 days left till this ultimately important election.
[00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:02.069]  Now, I'm going to cover news.
[00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:17.781]  Coming up at the start of the next segment, that is very important information that if it gets out to other people, we will be able to really turn a lot of things around.
[00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:28.090]  And of course, I'm talking about all the real numbers and real actuaries coming out of big banks and insurance companies in the United States, South Africa, Japan, Europe.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:44.085]  Showing that the lockdowns are a hoax, and that COVID-19 is a hoax, and that everyone dying of other diseases is counted as COVID-19, and is the biggest fraud the planet has ever seen.
[00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:46.006]  Daily Mail.
[00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:51.507]  Lockdowns fail to alter the course of pandemic, JPMorgan study claims.
[00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:52.728]  Well, they don't claim that.
[00:01:53.746 --> 00:02:07.529]  And then it ties in to all the real numbers, but the neuroses and the mental illness that it's manifested is going to take generations to go away unless we all start speaking out against the hoax.
[00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:14.791]  Now there is a real virus that came out of a weapons lab, and it has great gain of function, so a lot of people get it.
[00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:16.691]  So you can all be suspect.
[00:02:18.157 --> 00:02:27.085]  And so that in test it will match regular coronaviruses, one of the most common forms of death, so they can create fear.
[00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:31.368]  It is a fear weapon.
[00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:35.492]  Period.
[00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:38.835]  97,000 deaths in the United States and almost all of those
[00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:46.178]  We're individuals that were over 85 years of age and had up to three pre-existing conditions and most of the tests were fake.
[00:02:46.178 --> 00:02:48.959]  And that's all in the details.
[00:02:48.959 --> 00:03:00.585]  And when medical doctors and scientists, epidemiologists and virologists all go public, they get silenced.
[00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:07.108]  We have a guest joining us, who's gone viral, coming up in the second hour, who's a medical worker.
[00:03:08.373 --> 00:03:16.657]  And of course their videos have been getting sidelined and blacklisted as well because the system is desperate to keep this hoax going.
[00:03:16.657 --> 00:03:24.321]  So we're going to expose it all here today, but I cannot relay to you enough how important it is
[00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.472]  That you understand how powerful you are when you are silent.
[00:03:32.472 --> 00:03:36.353]  You give total acquiescence to the enemy and let them take over our lives.
[00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:42.516]  When you speak up and say no, you are powerful for all of us and for a pro-human future.
[00:03:42.516 --> 00:03:43.476]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:47.118]  We have a lot of really good news.
[00:03:47.118 --> 00:03:55.681]  Judge blasts Governor's stay-at-home order, overrides it, says Americans don't get ruled.
[00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:56.862]  That's coming up also.
[00:03:57.827 --> 00:04:23.298]  The Supreme Court of Brazil has ordered a Bolsonaro video to be released from a private cabinet meeting he was having, and it shows that he's just as real as we all knew he was, talking about how the communist cities within the country are locking things down to create a depression and martial law, and how they're a bunch of pieces of garbage, and a bunch of MFers, and a bunch of criminals that must be stopped.
[00:04:24.474 --> 00:04:25.476]  So that's all coming up.
[00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:34.251]  Speaking of that, in Communist China, they're using the fear of COVID-19 to openly talk about a military invasion of Hong Kong.
[00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:46.196]  So it is all coming up on this live May 24th, 2020 Sunday transmission with only 162 days left.
[00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:56.586]  Please tell everyone you know about the local AM and FM stations you're listening to, the little TV stations you're watching, and Band.Video, and the live feeds, as well as the easy place to find the feeds, Infowars.com, Ford's launch show.
[00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:00.978]  Memorial Day is here.
[00:05:00.978 --> 00:05:03.119]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:07.940]  Now, we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:16.504]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items that weren't on sale we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well.
[00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:17.284]  We're good to go!
[00:05:37.878 --> 00:05:46.465]  So InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139 to get these items to take advantage of this Mega Sale Memorial Day.
[00:05:46.465 --> 00:05:48.126]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:54.952]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[00:05:54.952 --> 00:05:56.473]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[00:05:56.473 --> 00:05:57.374]  We are all in this together.
[00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:23.421]  Yeah.
[00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:31.128]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this May 24th, 2020 Sunday transmission.
[00:06:31.128 --> 00:06:36.170]  Only 162 days left until this incredibly important election.
[00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:53.838]  I am here on this Sunday, the day before Memorial Day, because I really value the fact that there are people, even on a day when a lot of people are out barbecuing and having fun, that are so concerned about the country and the world that you're tuning in to try to get the latest information and analysis, and I will do my best to not let you down.
[00:06:54.994 --> 00:06:57.037]  Well here's the good news.
[00:06:57.037 --> 00:07:05.631]  We have judges in Illinois moving to override the unconstitutional continued lockdown order of the bureaucrats.
[00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:18.940]  We have Trump coming out on Friday and saying that he is saying the states are open and that religious services are essential or he will override the governors and that is a federal issue because it is the First Amendment.
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.461]  That's how the First Amendment begins.
[00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:33.729]  For those that don't know, Congress shall make no law respecting an established religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.
[00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:58.055]  And so, Trump said that on Friday, the Brazilian counterpart to Trump, who's even more hardcore than Trump, has come out and said this is communist martial law and he's going against the very same blue cities that we have here, the same types, that are using it as a permanent lockdown to bankrupt the economy and make people dependent.
[00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:02.856]  We're going to play that clip in a moment from Bolsonaro, but first, this is what President
[00:08:03.757 --> 00:08:08.920]  Trump had to say on Friday that has the left freaking out so bad.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.701]  Let's watch.
[00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:12.302]  Thank you very much.
[00:08:12.302 --> 00:08:21.667]  At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith.
[00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:32.753]  I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they've been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time.
[00:08:33.956 --> 00:08:49.290]  Today I'm identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogues, and mosques as essential places that provide essential services.
[00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:57.777]  Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship.
[00:08:57.777 --> 00:08:58.338]  It's not right.
[00:08:59.494 --> 00:09:06.456]  So I'm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.
[00:09:06.456 --> 00:09:13.719]  I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now.
[00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:20.981]  If there's any question, they're going to have to call me, but they're not going to be successful in that call.
[00:09:20.981 --> 00:09:25.123]  These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united.
[00:09:26.448 --> 00:09:32.310]  The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque.
[00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:38.852]  Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life.
[00:09:38.852 --> 00:09:51.236]  The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams, and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray.
[00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:52.796]  I know them well.
[00:09:52.796 --> 00:09:54.517]  They love their congregations.
[00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.249]  They love their people.
[00:09:57.249 --> 00:10:01.492]  They don't want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else.
[00:10:01.492 --> 00:10:12.860]  The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.843]  If they don't do it, I will override the governors.
[00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:21.226]  In America, we need more prayer, not less.
[00:10:21.226 --> 00:10:24.188]  Now, if President Trump said if a state banned abortion,
[00:10:26.124 --> 00:10:32.550]  And if Trump said, I'm going to override that state, he couldn't do that constitutionally or vice versa.
[00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:38.236]  But if a state said we're going to confiscate the guns, he could override that because that's in the Bill of Rights.
[00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:40.158]  And it's the same thing when it comes to churches.
[00:10:40.158 --> 00:10:45.023]  It's the First Amendment and it's federally protected 100%.
[00:10:45.023 --> 00:10:46.605]  We don't get the rights from the feds.
[00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:56.550]  The Bill of Rights was set up to enshrine the rights that were already there, and to say the government's job is to be a guarantor and a defender of those rights.
[00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:13.299]  And if it becomes destructive of those rights or aims, it is not just the people's right, but their duty to change or abolish, by any means necessary, those forms of government to which they've become accustomed.
[00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:16.868]  We've all heard of it.
[00:11:16.868 --> 00:11:28.112]  It's why we have July 4th and the fireworks going off in the sky symbolizing explosive cannonballs raining down shrapnel on British ships.
[00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:32.954]  It's called the Declaration of Independence.
[00:11:32.954 --> 00:11:35.675]  And Bolsonaro understands it.
[00:11:35.675 --> 00:11:37.636]  Big article on Infowars.com.
[00:11:37.636 --> 00:11:39.217]  And you know, I'm proud of our audience.
[00:11:39.217 --> 00:11:41.277]  I'm proud of your activism.
[00:11:41.277 --> 00:11:44.559]  I have met with Bolsonaro's son, who's a major member of their Congress.
[00:11:45.598 --> 00:11:47.199]  And we got an invite to go down there.
[00:11:47.199 --> 00:11:48.280]  We haven't been able to do it yet.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.842]  I'm trying to get them on the show via Skype.
[00:11:50.842 --> 00:12:00.170]  Ran into them at CPAC and they said, you know, you helped inspire us and we're one of the main movements to this happening.
[00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.991]  I'm like, okay.
[00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:01.952]  He goes, no, I'm serious.
[00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:04.614]  Why didn't you get back with me earlier?
[00:12:04.614 --> 00:12:08.395]  And I handed it off to a previous crew member that didn't get it done, so I'm handling it myself.
[00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:18.817]  But we're very proud of the fact that this whole operation, our crew, you the listeners and viewers that spread the articles and videos, you're responsible for the rebellions against the New World Order all over the world.
[00:12:18.817 --> 00:12:28.319]  UKIP's head has come on the broadcast, our founder, and said that they were getting almost no traction until about 15, 16 years ago.
[00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:31.360]  Suddenly, Nigel Farage would knock on doors and UKIP exploded.
[00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:37.924]  Because InfoWars was in the top 50 websites back then in the UK, according to Alexa.
[00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:42.667]  And again, it's not me bragging about InfoWars, it's about bragging about you.
[00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:55.558]  That this broadcast, and the feet and legs you gave it, we're in this together, has put Bolsonaro, thanks to his incredible courage and that's brutally stabbed and survived, the guy is amazing.
[00:12:55.558 --> 00:12:58.120]  And quite frankly, I think more hardcore than Trump.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.642]  He's more direct, he's just, uh,
[00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:07.422]  He's Trump 2.0 and I'm not kissing his ass just because we helped energize their operation.
[00:13:07.422 --> 00:13:08.363]  It's the truth.
[00:13:08.363 --> 00:13:09.204]  Listen to this guy.
[00:13:09.204 --> 00:13:20.932]  The Supreme Court ordered him to release his private meeting of cabinet officials because somebody snitched and said he was screaming at them.
[00:13:20.932 --> 00:13:22.714]  And so they did release it.
[00:13:22.714 --> 00:13:25.155]  And here is what he's saying in Portuguese.
[00:13:25.155 --> 00:13:26.656]  I'll do my best to read the subtitles.
[00:13:26.656 --> 00:13:28.778]  Here it is.
[00:13:28.778 --> 00:13:30.019]  Sir, Ministers of Justice, please.
[00:13:32.205 --> 00:13:35.507]  I was decided a long ago that you could handcuff almost no one.
[00:13:35.507 --> 00:13:41.369]  Why are they putting handcuffs on a citizen that's working, or on a woman in a public square?
[00:13:41.369 --> 00:13:44.331]  They keep on humiliating our people, and that's... Back it up.
[00:13:44.331 --> 00:13:45.791]  Let's start over again.
[00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:48.953]  Not a big deal, not a problem, but we kind of minimized it while I was talking.
[00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:54.515]  So let's just go all the way back to the start, and then I'm gonna read it as we go here.
[00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:56.096]  Thanks, guys.
[00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:57.797]  Okay, Sir Minister of Justice, please.
[00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:03.455]  It was decided not long ago that you couldn't handcuff almost no one.
[00:14:03.455 --> 00:14:11.339]  Why are they putting handcuffs on citizens that's working or a woman in a public square?
[00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:13.140]  And the justice doesn't do anything.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.702]  You have no effing... Back up again, please.
[00:14:17.702 --> 00:14:23.846]  You have no... You have to effing speak.
[00:14:23.846 --> 00:14:24.246]  Keep going.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.381]  You're going to be quiet until when?
[00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:35.844]  Or do I have to keep on exposing this myself?
[00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:36.864]  You have to speak.
[00:14:36.864 --> 00:14:37.505]  Put it out there.
[00:14:37.505 --> 00:14:40.546]  Dish it out.
[00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:47.750]  You can't put handcuffs, a decision, on the Supreme Court itself.
[00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.891]  And we're going to be quiet until when?
[00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:52.592]  They keep on humiliating our people, and that's growing.
[00:14:54.073 --> 00:14:55.614]  People keep on pointing at me.
[00:14:55.614 --> 00:15:00.155]  I voted on you for you to do something.
[00:15:00.155 --> 00:15:03.936]  Voted on you so you make decisions.
[00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:06.517]  And it's true.
[00:15:06.517 --> 00:15:09.578]  I couldn't care less with the re-election.
[00:15:09.578 --> 00:15:13.080]  And we have to think about that, all of us.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.442]  What these sons of bitches want is our freedom.
[00:15:18.442 --> 00:15:21.523]  Look, look how easy it is to impose a dictatorship in Brazil.
[00:15:21.523 --> 00:15:22.203]  How easy it is.
[00:15:25.267 --> 00:15:28.728]  The people are locked down in their homes.
[00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:38.912]  This is why I want the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Defense, that the people arm themselves with a second amendment.
[00:15:38.912 --> 00:15:45.294]  That's going to ensure that the MFers is going to show up and impose a dictatorship here.
[00:15:45.294 --> 00:15:48.095]  Because it's easy to impose a dictatorship here, too easy.
[00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:51.776]  An effing mayor, make a effing decree, handcuff people, keep everybody at home.
[00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:55.760]  He goes on to break it all down.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.540]  It's powerful.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.401]  Stay with us.
[00:15:58.401 --> 00:15:59.762]  Now it's official.
[00:15:59.762 --> 00:16:05.386]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years.
[00:16:05.386 --> 00:16:13.211]  And the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing.
[00:16:13.211 --> 00:16:17.133]  And you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit.
[00:16:17.133 --> 00:16:20.936]  And if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[00:16:21.776 --> 00:16:33.392]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order, where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:37.998]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian, anti-human group.
[00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:41.141]  The United States is not Communist China.
[00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:43.804]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[00:16:43.804 --> 00:16:44.444]  We don't blow up
[00:17:09.247 --> 00:17:10.067]  We're good to go.
[00:17:40.708 --> 00:17:41.128]  I think so.
[00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:05.907]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.

[00:20:01.371 --> 00:20:04.014]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.284 --> 00:20:27.288]  A digital frontier of slavery, of dehumanization.
[00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:36.393]  All right, I want to get into massively important news.
[00:20:36.393 --> 00:20:38.715]  JP Morgan has a big actuary that's come out.
[00:20:39.551 --> 00:20:43.613]  That basically shows the same type of things that South African insurance companies show.
[00:20:43.613 --> 00:20:53.318]  29 times the death caused by the COVID lockdown than actually caused by supposed COVID in South Africa.
[00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:55.879]  That came out two weeks ago.
[00:20:55.879 --> 00:20:59.040]  Well, lockdowns failed to alter the course of pandemic.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.183]  JP Morgan's study finds, Daily Mail, that's coming up next segment.
[00:21:05.691 --> 00:21:08.993]  I want to get back to Trump saying, time to open the economy.
[00:21:08.993 --> 00:21:13.215]  I want to get back to all these federal and state judges saying, time to open it up.
[00:21:13.215 --> 00:21:22.879]  And making very clear statements that governors and governments don't have the power to do things like this, but they are doing it.
[00:21:22.879 --> 00:21:28.082]  And then the numbers and the graphs and everything they base this on was a fraud.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:40.007]  What these sons of bitches want is our freedom, Bolsonaro vows to arm Brazilians to prevent dictatorship.
[00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:47.913]  Videos of a private speech delivered by Brazilian President Bolsonaro to his cabinet about freedom and guns went viral.
[00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:53.613]  On Saturday, after a court order, the release of one of his private meetings.
[00:21:53.613 --> 00:22:03.642]  Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo, released a video about the Brazilian Supreme Court issued an order on Friday to release one of President Bolsonaro's private staff meetings, this one particularly.
[00:22:03.642 --> 00:22:15.892]  The video shows President Bolsonaro going on the expo of lace rant against the communist and radical mayors in Brazil who stripped away the people's rights, culminating in the endorsement of gun ownership.
[00:22:16.772 --> 00:22:19.154]  Which he ran saying he would do.
[00:22:19.154 --> 00:22:21.656]  70-76 worldwide.
[00:22:21.656 --> 00:22:22.637]  God.
[00:22:22.637 --> 00:22:23.098]  Family.
[00:22:23.098 --> 00:22:24.819]  Country.
[00:22:24.819 --> 00:22:29.003]  Why are they putting handcuffs on citizens that's working for a woman in a public square?
[00:22:29.003 --> 00:22:30.364]  Talk about the lockdown.
[00:22:30.364 --> 00:22:32.106]  Bolsonaro said translated English.
[00:22:32.106 --> 00:22:35.108]  And the Justice Department doesn't say anything.
[00:22:35.108 --> 00:22:37.711]  You have to effing speak.
[00:22:37.711 --> 00:22:39.873]  They keep on humiliating our people and that's growing.
[00:22:40.885 --> 00:22:43.187]  What these sons of bitches want is our freedom.
[00:22:43.187 --> 00:22:45.669]  Look how easy it is to impose a dictatorship in Brazil.
[00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:46.890]  How easy it is to continue.
[00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.352]  The people are locked in their homes.
[00:22:49.352 --> 00:22:51.214]  This is what I want.
[00:22:51.214 --> 00:22:53.175]  That the people arm themselves.
[00:22:53.175 --> 00:22:59.000]  That's going to ensure that the mother effer is not going to show up and impose a dictatorship here.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.722]  Because it's easy to impose a dictatorship here.
[00:23:01.722 --> 00:23:02.863]  Too easy!
[00:23:02.863 --> 00:23:06.987]  A effing mayor makes a effing decree, handcuff people and keep everyone at home.
[00:23:09.198 --> 00:23:12.660]  If they were armed, they'd go to the streets.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:22.687]  And if I was a dictator, I'd want to disarm people, just like all the other disarmed people before they imposed their respective dictatorship.
[00:23:22.687 --> 00:23:29.192]  Because I don't want a dictatorship, he said, and it can't be postponed anymore.
[00:23:29.192 --> 00:23:34.095]  I want people armed because an armed people will never be a slave, he added.
[00:23:34.095 --> 00:23:36.477]  Man, this is George Washington 2.0 right here, baby.
[00:23:36.477 --> 00:23:37.358]  This is better than Trump.
[00:23:38.246 --> 00:23:42.589]  And again, they've stabbed him viciously in the liver and kidneys.
[00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:43.850]  Everybody's seen the footage.
[00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:44.810]  We should pull that up.
[00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.691]  Bolsonaro's stabbed.
[00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:47.552]  He's a total patriot.
[00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:48.853]  He's done everything he said he would do.
[00:23:48.853 --> 00:23:59.359]  But the cities that are left as controlled, they use a free society against it, are locked down martial law, bankrupting the normal businesses and normal people for control.
[00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:02.001]  And Bolsonaro understands that.
[00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:04.363]  They've only had 20,000 people die of COVID-19 there.
[00:24:06.305 --> 00:24:09.507]  They had three times that die of the flu.
[00:24:09.507 --> 00:24:14.129]  And so, the media is saying he's rocked by it.
[00:24:14.129 --> 00:24:17.531]  This is going to totally blow up in their faces.
[00:24:17.531 --> 00:24:19.992]  People want realness.
[00:24:19.992 --> 00:24:21.173]  People understand what's happening.
[00:24:21.173 --> 00:24:23.174]  The Supreme Court there has been after him.
[00:24:23.174 --> 00:24:26.716]  I predict if he doesn't back down or apologize, this will just make him stronger.
[00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:32.959]  By the way, talk about rocket fueled him and his family and they're all like, let's just say alpha males.
[00:24:32.959 --> 00:24:33.139]  So,
[00:24:34.642 --> 00:24:35.503]  They know what they're doing.
[00:24:35.503 --> 00:24:36.985]  They're risking their lives.
[00:24:36.985 --> 00:24:45.034]  It's beautiful and I'm very proud of the fact that InfoWars has inspired them and others and they inspire us as well greatly.
[00:24:45.034 --> 00:24:48.197]  But this whole lockdown is being used to destroy open free societies.
[00:24:48.197 --> 00:24:51.261]  The Democrats now, Bernie Sanders has admitted it.
[00:24:51.261 --> 00:24:52.562]  Other Democrats have admitted it.
[00:24:53.543 --> 00:24:55.544]  Just this last week, Hillary came out and admitted it.
[00:24:55.544 --> 00:24:57.885]  There were all these news headlines.
[00:24:57.885 --> 00:24:59.586]  USA Today, you name it.
[00:24:59.586 --> 00:25:07.769]  Oh, it's so good for the earth and the environment that we've had this lockdown and it's teaching us to change American society.
[00:25:07.769 --> 00:25:10.531]  It's teaching us how to live differently.
[00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:15.993]  It's all a bunch of billionaires that live on giant estates.
[00:25:15.993 --> 00:25:19.895]  They're telling us if we don't live the way they want us to live, all the ice caps will be melted.
[00:25:20.683 --> 00:25:31.427]  By 2013 and 2017, and the same ones that constantly give us all these fake numbers and all these fake diagrams about how we're all dead unless we all stay locked up in our houses.
[00:25:31.427 --> 00:25:34.568]  But now, that is not the case.
[00:25:34.568 --> 00:25:46.813]  But if you look at it, whether it's Communist China going after Hong Kong, or their own people in mainland, or whether it's the corrupt EU, or whether it is socialist and communist cities and states that are within free nations in the US or in Brazil,
[00:25:48.351 --> 00:26:05.476]  Every communist mayor, every socialist mayor, every leftist mayor has used this to lock their people down and then call their globalist businesses essential, which is the ultimate form of discrimination.
[00:26:05.476 --> 00:26:08.136]  But the race-based system is coming to an end.
[00:26:08.136 --> 00:26:13.998]  People get that it's about individual rights and freedom and all of us being essential.
[00:26:13.998 --> 00:26:17.459]  That's why when Joe Biden came out with Charlemagne Tha God radio show and said,
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.401]  You're not black if you vote for Trump.
[00:26:21.401 --> 00:26:28.064]  That that created a giant exodus of people who didn't want to be talked to like they were a plantation slave.
[00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:32.806]  You see, we're all on the New World Order plantation, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:32.806 --> 00:26:33.806]  And it's time to get off of it.
[00:26:33.806 --> 00:26:41.509]  But when I come back, I'm actually going to burrow into the numbers here that I was mentioning that are so huge that we already know, but now it's JPMorgan saying it.
[00:26:42.743 --> 00:26:44.066]  Okay, yeah.
[00:26:44.066 --> 00:26:45.248]  The lockdown's been a fraud.
[00:26:45.248 --> 00:26:46.690]  It didn't protect people.
[00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:50.777]  The cities that have the ongoing lockdown have the highest levels of COVID-19 and the highest death rate.
[00:26:51.664 --> 00:26:53.645]  Now, they don't extrapolate out why that is.
[00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:57.186]  I will, with the anecdotal prima facie evidence.
[00:26:57.186 --> 00:26:58.286]  That's all coming up.
[00:26:58.286 --> 00:27:05.769]  Separately, we have a Memorial Day special going right now that is going to have to end in just a few days.
[00:27:05.769 --> 00:27:15.812]  Our big mega giant sale, we've been running for over a week and a half, has had to come to an end because about a third of the products that we had have been sold out.
[00:27:15.812 --> 00:27:18.893]  In fact, I had my print off for the new promo
[00:27:19.881 --> 00:27:33.134]  Here on Friday, and it's not here, so if you guys will go into the producers folder for me over there, it'll have the new ad that I personally wrote Friday and emailed over.
[00:27:33.134 --> 00:27:34.396]  Thanks.
[00:27:34.396 --> 00:27:38.980]  But separately, ladies and gentlemen, Memorial Day

[00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:53.321]  Stay with us.
[00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:05.092]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is.
[00:29:05.092 --> 00:29:21.016]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world, and a horrible, nightmarish collapse for the first world, and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the megabanks.
[00:29:21.016 --> 00:29:24.297]  They're not going to have medical ID cards or sinoculations.
[00:29:24.297 --> 00:29:27.578]  We are now in a giant dystopia.
[00:29:28.158 --> 00:29:47.128]  But a lot of people are waking up, and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our Bill of Rights, rediscover our Constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it'll save lives.
[00:29:47.128 --> 00:29:51.750]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:56.612]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtue signaling, you have destroyed your life and our lives.
[00:29:56.612 --> 00:29:57.473]  Congratulations.
[00:29:58.911 --> 00:30:09.879]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down and shutting down is like shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot and then it finally dies.
[00:30:09.879 --> 00:30:27.452]  She said, well yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out of a huge hole and he was holding it and he walked around gibbering, talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead.
[00:30:28.132 --> 00:30:30.693]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[00:30:30.693 --> 00:30:32.694]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[00:30:32.694 --> 00:30:40.918]  This has been done by design, and the UN, the CHICOMS, the mainstream media orchestrated it, hyped it, and tried to keep the economy closed.
[00:30:40.918 --> 00:30:47.501]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:51.746]  On Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[00:30:51.746 --> 00:30:52.647]  We tried to stop it.
[00:30:52.647 --> 00:30:53.528]  We tried to fight it.
[00:30:53.528 --> 00:30:57.853]  But you guys said you wanted to wreck America and the world, and now you've done it.
[00:30:57.853 --> 00:30:58.874]  Congratulations.
[00:30:58.874 --> 00:31:03.300]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election.
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.184]  It is a referendum of national sovereignty against globalism.
[00:31:07.845 --> 00:31:17.637]  That Obama, Hillary, and the Deep State have been caught attempting to overthrow President Trump's election, and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the President.
[00:31:17.637 --> 00:31:24.485]  Now, they've been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression, while China's already been open for business for more than a month.
[00:31:25.226 --> 00:31:37.310]  This is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy, and hope that we won't recognize that it is they, the New World Order, that have orchestrated this and not President Trump.
[00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.050]  They know their crimes are coming out.
[00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.971]  They know the chickens are coming home to roast.
[00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:50.080]  So now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public safe from COVID-19.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:56.607]  The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hoax and must be exposed if America has any hope.
[00:31:56.607 --> 00:31:58.369]  So get out there and expose this fraud.
[00:31:59.138 --> 00:32:00.739]  Memorial Day is here.
[00:32:00.739 --> 00:32:02.921]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:07.705]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[00:32:07.705 --> 00:32:16.313]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items that weren't on sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well.
[00:32:16.633 --> 00:32:17.013]  We're good to go!
[00:32:37.625 --> 00:32:46.208]  So InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139 to get these items and take advantage of this Mega Sale Memorial Day.
[00:32:46.208 --> 00:32:47.869]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[00:32:47.869 --> 00:32:54.712]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[00:32:54.712 --> 00:32:56.212]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[00:32:56.212 --> 00:33:02.315]  We are all in this together.
[00:33:02.315 --> 00:33:04.956]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.596 --> 00:33:11.782]  I don't know.
[00:33:40.788 --> 00:33:50.135]  So Trump did a powerful Cheryl Atkinson interview that's posted in full at InfoWars.com, where he led a lot of really important issues.
[00:33:50.135 --> 00:33:51.276]  It's a 24-minute interview.
[00:33:51.276 --> 00:34:03.225]  We won't air the whole thing here, but here he is talking about having a chance, if he gets re-elected, to break the Deep State, which is an organized group of globalist criminals in the bureaucracy.
[00:34:03.225 --> 00:34:03.565]  Here it is.
[00:34:05.688 --> 00:34:07.993]  I'm fighting the swamp.
[00:34:07.993 --> 00:34:09.096]  And I said I was doing it.
[00:34:09.096 --> 00:34:10.259]  And I'm exposing the swamp.
[00:34:12.372 --> 00:34:21.036]  If it keeps going the way I'm going, and Ratliff is fantastic, if it keeps going the way it's going, I have a chance to break the deep state.
[00:34:21.036 --> 00:34:26.879]  It's a vicious group of people, it's very bad for our country, and that's never happened before.
[00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:36.144]  You happen to be a victim of the deep state, I hate to tell you, whether you know it or not, but they've treated you horribly over the years, and so have they treated many other people.
[00:34:36.144 --> 00:34:38.185]  They never thought I was going to win, and then I won.
[00:34:39.125 --> 00:34:40.645]  And then they tried to get me out.
[00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:42.386]  That was the insurance policy.
[00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:46.807]  She's going to win, but just in case she doesn't win, we have an insurance policy.
[00:34:46.807 --> 00:34:48.868]  And now I beat them on the insurance policy.
[00:34:48.868 --> 00:34:50.768]  And now they're being exposed.
[00:34:50.768 --> 00:34:52.609]  Comey is a dirty cop.
[00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:54.469]  McCabe, bad guy.
[00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.190]  These are all bad guy.
[00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.090]  Lisa Page and Strzok.
[00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.031]  These are the two lovers, right?
[00:35:00.771 --> 00:35:03.934]  Yeah, we forget that they used forged documents to get the FISA court.
[00:35:24.727 --> 00:35:28.808]  To allow the illegal spying on Trump, because even then it was illegal.
[00:35:28.808 --> 00:35:40.451]  And I forget that it was William Benning two and a half years ago that called me and he said, you know, the federal court, the FISA Oversight Court has come out and said that this was fraud.
[00:35:40.451 --> 00:35:42.572]  No one's covered it.
[00:35:42.572 --> 00:35:43.472]  You should cover it.
[00:35:43.472 --> 00:35:45.713]  And we exposed what the Nunes memo was.
[00:35:45.713 --> 00:35:49.114]  Nunes was saying, oh, I'm going to expose this incredible
[00:35:50.455 --> 00:35:57.818]  Federal court oversight, dealing with the unmasking and dealing with the crossfire hurricane.
[00:35:57.818 --> 00:36:00.199]  But there it was!
[00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:07.041]  And I had to have the former technical head of the NSA call me up and tell me, Alex, go look at this.
[00:36:07.041 --> 00:36:11.783]  There it is, February 1st, 2018, over two years ago.
[00:36:11.783 --> 00:36:13.264]  And again, it's not that I'm even that smart.
[00:36:15.083 --> 00:36:21.208]  We have a little platform here that people that are good in the government and good in corporations use to get stuff out.
[00:36:21.208 --> 00:36:23.490]  It's not that I'm that special they want to get us off there.
[00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:29.034]  It's that I will tell the truth and I will have whistleblowers on.
[00:36:29.034 --> 00:36:34.959]  And that scares the living daylights out of the establishment who have hijacked this country.
[00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:37.381]  But there's the ongoing head of the FBI.
[00:36:39.633 --> 00:36:41.334]  I'm not sure why we threw him up there, but there he is.
[00:36:41.334 --> 00:36:43.856]  There's the director of the FBI currently.
[00:36:43.856 --> 00:36:51.763]  Now, let me go ahead and get into this next piece of news and information.
[00:36:51.763 --> 00:36:54.184]  I'm not mad that they put the current director of the FBI up.
[00:36:54.184 --> 00:36:56.967]  It's just that they're in there pulling up whatever I talk about.
[00:36:56.967 --> 00:36:58.007]  We don't pre-script the show.
[00:36:58.007 --> 00:36:59.469]  I get ready, then they hear me talk about stuff.
[00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:01.410]  They just type stuff in and pull it up.
[00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:05.413]  I don't want to create some new Q thing or some cryptic deal because we randomly put that up there.
[00:37:09.366 --> 00:37:15.468]  Let me hit the, since we did that, let me just hit more about what we were just covering.
[00:37:15.468 --> 00:37:22.211]  And in the next segment, I'll get into the JP Morgan admitting that basically COVID lockdowns are a hoax.
[00:37:22.211 --> 00:37:22.831]  It's a big deal.
[00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:24.252]  I mean, we already know this.
[00:37:24.252 --> 00:37:28.993]  We can look at the same numbers they're looking at, and it's just absolutely on its face, open and shut, two plus two equals four.
[00:37:28.993 --> 00:37:30.254]  It's ridiculous.
[00:37:30.254 --> 00:37:34.175]  But let's get back into what they were just talking about.
[00:37:34.175 --> 00:37:35.496]  Trump has now removed
[00:37:37.094 --> 00:37:40.055]  Five so-called inspector generals.
[00:37:40.055 --> 00:37:53.018]  Because you've got these agencies, and you go, oh, well, they're not rogue agencies because they've got inspector generals over them.
[00:37:53.018 --> 00:38:00.360]  But when the inspector generals are globalist, and when the inspector generals go along with three attempted coup attempts on the president,
[00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.491]  You have to remove them.
[00:38:03.491 --> 00:38:13.357]  Most presidents come in, they remove all the inspector generals, they remove the attorney general, they remove whoever was there because it's a part of having who you got elected put in.
[00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:15.278]  So the people you know, you trust.
[00:38:15.278 --> 00:38:17.320]  The American people elected Trump.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.981]  We respect him.
[00:38:18.981 --> 00:38:20.441]  We trust him.
[00:38:20.441 --> 00:38:22.082]  So, Bill Clinton.
[00:38:22.082 --> 00:38:23.403]  I didn't like Bill Clinton.
[00:38:23.403 --> 00:38:24.404]  I didn't trust Bill Clinton.
[00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:27.229]  But you know what he did?
[00:38:27.229 --> 00:38:28.470]  He fired every U.S.
[00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.490]  attorney the first day he got in office.
[00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:35.512]  Trump didn't fire anybody.
[00:38:35.512 --> 00:38:38.352]  Because he didn't know what he was really up against.
[00:38:38.352 --> 00:38:45.975]  And that these people had all been put in place by the Clintons, and by Obama, and by the Bushes, and were globalists.
[00:38:45.975 --> 00:38:48.355]  And so everything he did, they were going to leak.
[00:38:48.355 --> 00:38:50.476]  Everything he stood up for, they were going to undermine.
[00:38:51.485 --> 00:38:53.747]  And so we've said, purge them!
[00:38:53.747 --> 00:38:58.572]  Don't purge them like the communists do, marching out in the field and shooting in the back of the head.
[00:38:58.572 --> 00:39:00.094]  Communists aren't elected.
[00:39:00.094 --> 00:39:03.837]  We elected Bolsonaro to defend the Brazilian people.
[00:39:03.837 --> 00:39:04.598]  They did.
[00:39:04.598 --> 00:39:05.879]  We elected President Trump.
[00:39:05.879 --> 00:39:10.104]  We, the people of this planet, elected Trump to go back to a programming future.
[00:39:11.175 --> 00:39:24.868]  And so for him to remove people because he's found out their allegiance isn't to America, their allegiance isn't to the people that voted Trump in, their allegiance is to the global New World Order.
[00:39:24.868 --> 00:39:27.971]  And because Trump's never been a sellout to globalists, he just can't believe it.
[00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:28.872]  They lie to his face.
[00:39:30.629 --> 00:39:35.811]  So now Joe Maguire has been removed as the Acting Director of National Intelligence.
[00:39:35.811 --> 00:39:43.835]  And Trump has put his guy in that will get the job done of ferreting out the fifth column out of the United States.
[00:39:43.835 --> 00:39:48.237]  So, we've had Intelligence Committee Inspector General Michael Atkinson, bye-bye.
[00:39:48.237 --> 00:39:51.998]  Department of Defense Acting Inspector General Glenn Fine, bye-bye.
[00:39:51.998 --> 00:39:56.640]  Health and Human Services Acting Inspector General Christine Grimm, goodbye.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.822]  State Department Inspector General Stephen Linick, goodbye.
[00:40:01.701 --> 00:40:07.848]  Department of Transportation Acting Inspector General, Mitch, B-E-H-M, gone.
[00:40:07.848 --> 00:40:12.995]  And now we've got this latest, Joe McGuire, gone, gone, gone, gone.
[00:40:12.995 --> 00:40:20.183]  And don't let the door slap you on your New World Order arse.
[00:40:20.183 --> 00:40:21.145]  The globalist coup,
[00:40:22.375 --> 00:40:23.757]  Is being removed.
[00:40:23.757 --> 00:40:33.712]  And all these globalists like William McRaven that ran the whole fake Navy SEAL bin Laden crap and all the rest of this politicizing the Navy Special Warfare and ruining it.
[00:40:33.712 --> 00:40:34.713]  This, this joke!
[00:40:36.118 --> 00:40:45.827]  Talks about patriotism, and talks about traitors within, and Edmund Burke quotes, the only thing necessary for triumph of evil is good men do nothing.
[00:40:45.827 --> 00:40:59.861]  They have presided over the destruction of the Republic, the sellout to the Communist Chinese, the New World Order, a drag queen story time federally funded, Hollywood hating America, Hollywood funding race war,
[00:41:01.042 --> 00:41:17.507]  All the demoralization, all the one-sided trade deals to shut our economy down, letting the radical Islamists in, the list goes on and on and on and on, allowing criminal elements of the CIA to ship narcotics in.
[00:41:17.507 --> 00:41:23.369]  You know why everybody's really pissed at Trump on the dark side, on the New World War side?
[00:41:23.369 --> 00:41:26.450]  Because Trump's cutting all that off.
[00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.971]  He's removing the governmental narcotics traffickers.
[00:41:29.878 --> 00:41:33.460]  Trump is a big anti-drug guy and he's like, this is a joke.
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.663]  And so it's all being ended right now.
[00:41:36.663 --> 00:41:39.725]  And it's absolutely pissing them off to no end.
[00:41:39.725 --> 00:41:40.645]  And I love it.
[00:41:40.645 --> 00:41:43.807]  I mean, Trump's totally for real in that he really wants to be president.
[00:41:43.807 --> 00:41:46.129]  He believes he's doing the right thing.
[00:41:46.129 --> 00:41:51.272]  He made a lot of mistakes, not getting rid of all these globalists when he got in, but he didn't know who they all were.
[00:41:51.272 --> 00:41:56.096]  He counted on others under him to go out and get him good staff.
[00:41:57.278 --> 00:42:00.339]  Well, the first thing they did was blackmail and threaten everybody around Trump.
[00:42:00.339 --> 00:42:04.720]  I mean, I'm down the line from the top of the pyramid with Trump, at least two levels.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:21.245]  And they have been on me, my whole family, dirty tricks, lies, New York Times, Washington Post, assigned dirty trick reporters, private investigators, foreign intelligence agencies, attempted blackmail operations, sex operatives.
[00:42:23.186 --> 00:42:24.768]  I'm down the hill, man.
[00:42:24.768 --> 00:42:30.195]  I mean, I'm in Texas not trying to be in the swamp, not trying to parlay power, not trying to get favors done.
[00:42:30.195 --> 00:42:32.177]  I'm just trying to promote freedom.
[00:42:32.177 --> 00:42:35.661]  And they have had an army on my ass.
[00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:38.344]  So let me tell you, anyone in that White House
[00:42:39.065 --> 00:42:43.266]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back in stock, like krill oil.
[00:42:43.266 --> 00:42:45.007]  We have the ultimate krill oil.
[00:42:45.007 --> 00:42:46.647]  If you don't know the benefits of krill oil,
[00:43:08.917 --> 00:43:09.838]  It's incredible.
[00:43:09.838 --> 00:43:10.719]  Everything in your body.

[00:43:15.843 --> 00:43:17.344]  Experience it for yourself.

[00:43:36.038 --> 00:43:37.980]  That's close to selling out, 50% off still.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:44.463]  Infowarsstore.com and we're already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying we may not take orders in a few months.
[00:43:44.463 --> 00:43:46.524]  I may not ever be able to get products again.
[00:43:46.524 --> 00:43:48.606]  Things are collapsing so bad, folks.
[00:43:48.606 --> 00:43:50.226]  This is total depression.
[00:43:50.226 --> 00:43:51.887]  The infrastructure is going down.
[00:43:51.887 --> 00:43:52.948]  Get the products while you still can.
[00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:13.317]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at, say, 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:23.081]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over, and they die.
[00:44:23.081 --> 00:44:26.023]  Then you go bag them and haul them back in.
[00:44:26.903 --> 00:44:30.407]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[00:44:30.407 --> 00:44:36.273]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart.
[00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:41.359]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:45.583]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to the UN, and I believe their numbers.
[00:44:46.204 --> 00:44:50.928]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[00:44:50.928 --> 00:44:59.936]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[00:44:59.936 --> 00:45:02.238]  This is the end, my friends.
[00:45:02.238 --> 00:45:04.399]  My only friends, the end.
[00:45:04.399 --> 00:45:06.941]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[00:45:06.941 --> 00:45:10.104]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[00:45:10.104 --> 00:45:11.205]  The safety.
[00:45:11.205 --> 00:45:11.806]  The delusion.
[00:45:12.711 --> 00:45:14.893]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:14.893 --> 00:45:18.116]  Because it was only the mirage of safety.
[00:45:18.116 --> 00:45:21.258]  Movies and partying and living like children.
[00:45:21.258 --> 00:45:24.421]  Never growing up, never caring about other people.
[00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:28.124]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[00:45:28.124 --> 00:45:31.107]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states.
[00:45:31.107 --> 00:45:36.191]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity.
[00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:44.133]  Because their people sold out to special interests that were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved.
[00:45:44.133 --> 00:45:46.194]  We are repeating that again today.
[00:45:46.194 --> 00:45:52.116]  Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:54.797]  Infowars has decided to fight for freedom.
[00:45:54.797 --> 00:45:58.079]  Infowars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:03.201]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[00:46:03.201 --> 00:46:09.006]  And I told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[00:46:09.006 --> 00:46:11.968]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[00:46:11.968 --> 00:46:19.314]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[00:46:19.314 --> 00:46:20.855]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[00:46:20.855 --> 00:46:23.797]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[00:46:23.797 --> 00:46:25.679]  But with the election fraud and the
[00:46:25.859 --> 00:46:26.059]  I don't
[00:46:50.128 --> 00:46:51.289]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:16.659 --> 00:47:18.259]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[00:47:18.259 --> 00:47:29.943]  We're broadcasting worldwide and, you know, we have a very special guest joining us next hour who I'll tell you about in a few minutes, but let me just throw this out.
[00:47:29.943 --> 00:47:38.805]  If you've got some baseball player signing a five-year hundred million dollar contract with some NFL player or basketball player, I don't care.
[00:47:38.805 --> 00:47:40.846]  But when my old friend Joe Rogan, I've known 22 years,
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.541]  Moved to Spotify.
[00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:47.583]  It wasn't about the money because I know the contract details.
[00:47:47.583 --> 00:47:48.904]  He's making the same amount he was.
[00:47:48.904 --> 00:47:55.548]  He did it because he wanted freedom and didn't like the fact that YouTube had been censoring him.
[00:47:55.548 --> 00:47:56.848]  And Joe told me that.
[00:47:56.848 --> 00:48:00.490]  And Joe said, you can talk about that Thursday.
[00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:05.413]  He just didn't know how big it would be and how that would kind of overshadow that the stock was up $5 billion.
[00:48:05.413 --> 00:48:08.015]  And so it wasn't that he didn't want that out there.
[00:48:08.015 --> 00:48:10.076]  It was that they didn't want that to be the story.
[00:48:12.182 --> 00:48:16.506]  I said how great Spotify is going to be and how it's going to be free speech going forward.
[00:48:16.506 --> 00:48:17.306]  So I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:48:17.306 --> 00:48:27.595]  But everything I said on Thursday was what Joe told me, but with my own view on it.
[00:48:27.595 --> 00:48:30.497]  Like, Joe didn't say, I'm the real Alex Jones.
[00:48:30.497 --> 00:48:35.141]  No, I said, wow Joe, you really are coming out against the globalists.
[00:48:35.141 --> 00:48:36.862]  You're coming out against Obama.
[00:48:36.862 --> 00:48:39.204]  You're coming out against all these people and what you're telling me.
[00:48:39.204 --> 00:48:39.845]  This is beautiful.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.640]  And now look at Fox News today.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.741]  Joe Rogan would vote for President Trump over Joe Biden.
[00:48:47.741 --> 00:48:52.022]  I don't think he can handle anything.
[00:48:52.022 --> 00:48:55.982]  They want to say it's an insult to put somebody up this brain damaged.
[00:48:55.982 --> 00:49:00.823]  Well, I mean, that's what I came and told you Thursday Joe was saying.
[00:49:00.823 --> 00:49:01.523]  But I get it.
[00:49:01.523 --> 00:49:03.083]  I'm so attacked or whatever.
[00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:04.844]  Let Joe say it himself.
[00:49:04.844 --> 00:49:05.384]  Here's another one.
[00:49:05.384 --> 00:49:11.885]  Joe Rogan, Obamagate is real, illegal, and basically Obama's a criminal.
[00:49:11.885 --> 00:49:12.505]  That's been put out.
[00:49:14.488 --> 00:49:22.871]  By the way, Thursday when I talked to Joe at Link, I mean I've talked to him obviously every day since then, but he just taped those shows.
[00:49:22.871 --> 00:49:24.632]  Look, I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:49:24.632 --> 00:49:33.575]  It was obviously hyperbole in there for me and my view on what Joe was doing and the fact that we need to see other platforms, not just like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, censor everybody.
[00:49:33.575 --> 00:49:37.616]  And so if Spotify does that with Joe, that'll open the way up for so many others.
[00:49:37.616 --> 00:49:42.818]  And Joe said, you can say, I'm really upset by all these medical doctors, they're censoring off the air.
[00:49:43.697 --> 00:49:55.583]  That they don't want people to hear from who are talking about the models being all fraudulent, COVID-19 not being very deadly, and all the other deaths being attributed to COVID-19, which is confirmed!
[00:49:55.583 --> 00:49:59.685]  People have the right to say whatever they want, but they certainly have the right to say what's true!
[00:50:02.256 --> 00:50:13.943]  And so Joe said, oh sure, yo, go, yeah, go, great conversation, and I'm like, man, you're really amped up and excited, and yeah, stock's up two billion, and I just want to have free speech, and I'm like, great, I can say all this, yeah, just don't say these few things.
[00:50:13.943 --> 00:50:17.105]  I didn't say the few things he told me.
[00:50:17.105 --> 00:50:23.409]  Like, Joe's like, yeah, I'm looking at moving to Texas, and blah, blah, blah, and some other things, and can I say that?
[00:50:23.409 --> 00:50:26.651]  Yeah, just don't say these particulars, and then I said that, and I was talking to him, and he goes, hey,
[00:50:29.619 --> 00:50:30.659]  Told people I'm coming to Texas.
[00:50:30.659 --> 00:50:33.540]  I said, dude, do you forget you'd already said that on your podcast?
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.300]  He goes, oh, yeah.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.201]  So, you know, Joe's a really great guy.
[00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:37.981]  He's a smart guy.
[00:50:37.981 --> 00:50:42.902]  And I know he's a patriot, but it doesn't matter because it's not Alex Jones saying it now.
[00:50:42.902 --> 00:50:56.065]  They released this podcast yesterday where he says that Joe Biden is an embarrassment and a joke and an insult and a slap in the face to everybody.
[00:50:56.065 --> 00:50:57.485]  And so that's all over the news now.
[00:50:57.485 --> 00:50:58.025]  And that's great.
[00:50:59.773 --> 00:51:03.039]  Just exactly what I told you on Thursday.
[00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:09.731]  That Joe is pulling away from this because he knows it's so destructive.
[00:51:09.731 --> 00:51:11.755]  Here's the clip Fox News is playing.
[00:51:12.366 --> 00:51:16.048]  We need, I mean, I can't vote for that guy.
[00:51:16.048 --> 00:51:17.129]  I can't vote for him.
[00:51:17.129 --> 00:51:18.250]  I can't vote for him.
[00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:20.111]  I can't vote for Trump.
[00:51:20.111 --> 00:51:22.353]  I'd rather vote for Trump than him.
[00:51:22.353 --> 00:51:23.713]  I don't think he could handle anything.
[00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.775]  I mean, you're relying entirely on his cabinet.
[00:51:25.775 --> 00:51:31.939]  Like if you want to talk about an individual leader that can communicate, he can't do that.
[00:51:31.939 --> 00:51:33.020]  So there you go.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:40.985]  So what I said on air was 80% of what Joe said and then my view on what it meant.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:48.144]  And then I get having Alex Jones become the spokesperson for this big move away from YouTube to Spotify.
[00:51:48.144 --> 00:51:49.845]  It's probably not what they were looking for.
[00:51:49.845 --> 00:51:53.327]  I just don't think Joe realized how we get seized on and put out the news.
[00:51:53.327 --> 00:51:54.568]  But it's all on its face.
[00:51:54.568 --> 00:52:01.572]  I mean, look, let's just move Joe Rogan out of the equation.
[00:52:01.572 --> 00:52:04.394]  Everybody is in an exodus away from control.
[00:52:04.394 --> 00:52:07.395]  I don't care if you're liberal, conservative, old, young, black, white.
[00:52:07.395 --> 00:52:08.896]  People want freedom.
[00:52:08.896 --> 00:52:11.378]  And speaking of that, here's a little five-minute segment
[00:52:12.526 --> 00:52:27.970]  Of the individual that's going to be joining us in the next hour, Josiah Dan, who is a registered nurse who went out and gave a viral interview with millions of views, 20 years in health care on COVID-19.
[00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.031]  Here's what he had to say.
[00:52:30.031 --> 00:52:34.252]  Here's the boil down that he'll join us live coming up in the next hour.
[00:52:34.252 --> 00:52:36.073]  We'll look at all the numbers.
[00:52:36.073 --> 00:52:40.314]  JP Morgan admitting that the lockdown made it worse and so much more, but here's what they don't want you to see.
[00:52:40.879 --> 00:52:49.670]  I stand before you as a practicing medical professional that questions the validity of the claims leveled about this pandemic.
[00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:59.382]  I stand with many of the doctors, PAs, nurse practitioners, and a host of other medical professionals who dare to question the narrative as it has been presented to us by the media.
[00:53:00.319 --> 00:53:12.045]  I have taken care of many patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have assisted to intubate them, manage their medications, and get them to whatever level of care they need to get to.
[00:53:12.045 --> 00:53:27.894]  As I have cared for these patients and attempted to keep up with the latest information as best I can, I have discovered that much of what is stated by the media outlets and state leaders does not match up with reality in the workplace and according to the scientific peer-reviewed literature.
[00:53:29.483 --> 00:53:31.405]  So what did the experts say?
[00:53:31.405 --> 00:53:38.290]  Is the view of the sciences and the healthcare community a consensus as seems to be portrayed by the media and state governments?
[00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:42.274]  The answer to this question is a resounding no.
[00:53:42.274 --> 00:53:46.797]  I stand here as proof that the healthcare community is not of one mind.
[00:53:46.797 --> 00:53:53.843]  I have had many conversations with my colleagues who have expressed dissenting opinions from the apparent mainstream view.
[00:53:53.843 --> 00:53:54.584]  Should we mask?
[00:53:55.367 --> 00:53:57.209]  Should we open businesses?
[00:53:57.209 --> 00:53:59.631]  Should we be in fear of our lives?
[00:53:59.631 --> 00:54:07.397]  If we listen to the media and the governor, like our own, the answer to this question actually stands in defiance of the data and history.
[00:54:07.397 --> 00:54:16.745]  Our country has largely shut down its workforce and hidden in fear from an invisible enemy that has claimed in the ballpark of as many lives as a bad, severe flu season.
[00:54:16.745 --> 00:54:23.070]  Today we collectively suffer from broad business closures, violating both the Constitution and our individual rights.
[00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:38.577]  Mandatory masking policies are in large part a spurious attempt at best to gain PR for the state officials seeming to act as if they are doing something to protect us as individuals, while in fact may very well be putting us at higher risk for illness.
[00:54:38.577 --> 00:54:43.079]  Wearing masks outside of enclosed spaces, i.e.
[00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:45.980]  in nature, is ridiculous and asinine.
[00:54:47.634 --> 00:54:52.615]  Quarantining the healthy has never been mandated on a mass scale such as this.
[00:54:52.615 --> 00:54:57.117]  And we are seeing the profound economic effects with record unemployment levels.
[00:54:57.117 --> 00:55:05.859]  We are being told that we need to start contact tracing to limit exposure and track those who have been infected or affected by COVID-19.
[00:55:05.859 --> 00:55:08.700]  Now listen to me very clearly.
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.520]  Listen clearly.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:15.562]  Just, let's just cut the PC speech out and call it what it is.
[00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:16.882]  This is Big Brother.
[00:55:19.793 --> 00:55:27.459]  I don't know about you, but I don't want the federal or state government meddling in my affairs any more than they already are.
[00:55:27.459 --> 00:55:34.906]  My home is my own, and the government tracers are not welcome to come into it.
[00:55:34.906 --> 00:55:40.170]  They're not welcome to come to my home, nor to come into it.
[00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:44.734]  Say no to contact tracing laws, and don't comply when they push you to do so.
[00:55:45.993 --> 00:55:51.936]  These programs ultimately are driving to control you at your most foundational level, your body.
[00:55:51.936 --> 00:55:56.038]  The Contact Tracing Bill, H.R.
[00:55:56.038 --> 00:56:11.765]  6666, seeks to destroy these protections, ultimately opening the door to mandated tracking, which violates our right to privacy, and forced vaccination, which ultimately is forced medical experimentation.
[00:56:11.765 --> 00:56:14.586]  These oversteps and tyranny do not go unnoticed.
[00:56:15.894 --> 00:56:19.438]  We are a freedom-loving people and we abhor tyranny.
[00:56:19.438 --> 00:56:23.482]  We will not back down when threatened.
[00:56:23.482 --> 00:56:31.151]  Cease and desist of your current course of action!
[00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:33.373]  And this is for all of us.
[00:56:33.373 --> 00:56:36.416]  We stand at a precipice and have before us a choice.
[00:56:37.685 --> 00:56:40.127]  From behind comes a torrent of destruction.
[00:56:40.127 --> 00:56:45.350]  A new normal that threatens the very freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and by the Bill of Rights.
[00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:48.251]  Alright folks, we're going to stop right there.
[00:56:48.251 --> 00:56:50.493]  We're going to come back with the rest of the speech next hour.
[00:56:50.493 --> 00:56:52.954]  And then Josiah Dann will be joining us.
[00:56:52.954 --> 00:56:54.515]  Look at this MSN article.
[00:56:54.515 --> 00:56:58.638]  Undercover agents enforcing state health rules at restaurant bars.
[00:56:58.638 --> 00:57:02.160]  This is how they get you used to secret police, to being tracked by your cell phones.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.821]  This is the UN Globalist Takeover.
[00:57:06.067 --> 00:57:09.412]  Bill and Melinda Gates admit themselves.
[00:57:09.412 --> 00:57:14.659]  He joins us live next hour.
[00:57:14.659 --> 00:57:19.726]  Now, I know that over a million people on the Sunday show
[00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:21.518]  Are tuned in right now.
[00:57:48.362 --> 00:57:52.927]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[00:57:52.927 --> 00:57:55.970]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off.
[00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:59.113]  And they're like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[00:57:59.113 --> 00:58:00.895]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[00:58:00.895 --> 00:58:02.656]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[00:58:02.656 --> 00:58:04.538]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[00:58:04.538 --> 00:58:05.599]  You are non-essential.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.381]  We are shutting your ass down.
[00:58:08.381 --> 00:58:13.225]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[00:58:13.225 --> 00:58:14.886]  You're going to be the service economy.
[00:58:14.886 --> 00:58:20.269]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[00:58:20.269 --> 00:58:25.413]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[00:58:25.993 --> 00:58:28.595]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[00:58:28.595 --> 00:58:31.277]  We have to resist and say no to the New World Order.
[00:58:31.277 --> 00:58:33.939]  And that takes you understanding you were right.
[00:58:33.939 --> 00:58:35.460]  And understanding I was right.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:40.203]  And getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[00:58:40.203 --> 00:58:42.004]  Now is the time for action.
[00:58:42.004 --> 00:58:43.825]  Now is the time for you to shine.
[00:58:43.825 --> 00:58:45.807]  And be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[00:58:49.056 --> 00:58:52.198]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[00:58:52.198 --> 00:59:06.929]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended in a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in full control.
[00:59:06.929 --> 00:59:09.051]  Many will submit through fear.
[00:59:09.051 --> 00:59:10.132]  Others will be bought off.
[00:59:10.732 --> 00:59:16.175]  But in the end, the globalists admit they're building a post-human world.
[00:59:16.175 --> 00:59:22.739]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its endgame.
[00:59:22.739 --> 00:59:31.064]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell.
[00:59:36.284 --> 00:59:40.985]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being torn inside out.
[00:59:40.985 --> 00:59:51.808]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfish, disgusting power trip.
[00:59:51.808 --> 00:59:54.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.987 --> 01:00:13.211]  There have been hundreds of doctors, medical workers, nurses come out and tell people what they're seeing.
[01:00:13.211 --> 01:00:14.152]  Many of them have come out.
[01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:16.233]  I mean, I've seen probably 20 doctors at least.
[01:00:16.233 --> 01:00:17.554]  You've seen them too.
[01:00:17.554 --> 01:00:18.875]  And they always get taken off YouTube.
[01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:19.975]  They always get taken off Facebook.
[01:00:19.975 --> 01:00:22.857]  They get taken down everywhere.
[01:00:22.857 --> 01:00:27.980]  Saying, yeah, this old lady came in dying of heart failure at nine years old.
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.361]  They put COVID-19 on the deal.
[01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:31.643]  And doctors saying, we get pressure by the hospital.
[01:00:31.643 --> 01:00:33.263]  First time ever to say COVID-19.
[01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:33.924]  It's a car wreck.
[01:00:38.544 --> 01:00:50.534]  But let's go to this little piece ahead of Josiah Dan joining us of myself, the shooting range day with the crew had a little bit of fun and I channeled, I was possessed by Bill Gates at the end.
[01:00:50.534 --> 01:00:52.216]  Here is that report.
[01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:59.302]  We'll go to break and then we'll come back with Josiah Dan unfiltered live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:01:00.512 --> 01:01:06.234]  Alex Jones here in Austin, Texas with my buddy Tim, and he's a little bit better shot than I am with handguns.
[01:01:06.234 --> 01:01:14.556]  I'm a pretty good shot with most handguns and revolvers, but with this Smith & Wesson .500 I bought about four years ago, I just can't seem to hit the side of a barn door.
[01:01:14.556 --> 01:01:18.797]  And yes, a lot of people claim that handguns and rifles have big kicks.
[01:01:18.797 --> 01:01:22.778]  I've not experienced that even hand-holding barefoot decals and shooting them repeatedly.
[01:01:22.778 --> 01:01:27.099]  But this baby does hurt my wrist, so hopefully he can show me how to shoot more accurately and how to not hurt my wrist.
[01:01:27.099 --> 01:01:29.720]  So first I'm going to shoot it how I normally would, and then Tim is going to give me some tips.
[01:01:34.653 --> 01:01:35.654]  That clacked my teeth.
[01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:37.175]  I'm going to be a wimp today.
[01:01:37.175 --> 01:01:39.677]  You've seen me shoot once, now Tim can't.
[01:01:39.677 --> 01:01:48.444]  We're going to test out this made in China double barrel shotgun.
[01:01:48.444 --> 01:01:56.470]  If anything ever is going to blow up in your faces, we pray to the good lord it doesn't happen.
[01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:57.771]  Pretty fun.
[01:01:57.771 --> 01:02:02.034]  It was so close the winding went through, except for a few pellets opened up.
[01:02:02.034 --> 01:02:02.775]  That's a good group.
[01:02:04.048 --> 01:02:06.169]  Greg Reese from Infowars.com.
[01:02:06.169 --> 01:02:08.790]  Just got kind of my dream gun right here.
[01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:17.673]  It is a Galil Ace pistol in 5.56 Israel IWI Middletown PA.
[01:02:17.673 --> 01:02:18.313]  Very excited.
[01:02:18.313 --> 01:02:19.514]  This will be my first time shooting it.
[01:02:19.514 --> 01:02:23.655]  I just rough sighted it in with a laser barreled bore sight.
[01:02:23.655 --> 01:02:25.636]  And now we're going to see how the sights are here and how it shoots.
[01:02:48.305 --> 01:02:50.467]  So the idea, Tim, is to hit the head, not the body.
[01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:52.308]  It's like the body's a hostage.
[01:02:52.308 --> 01:03:10.623]  I'm gonna try to shoot the bad skeleton man and not the hostage.
[01:03:10.623 --> 01:03:14.306]  First I was dead on, only hitting the hostage taker.
[01:03:14.306 --> 01:03:16.467]  Until I realized there were too many people that Bill Gates
[01:03:17.475 --> 01:03:18.816]  And the Clintons and others are right.
[01:03:18.816 --> 01:03:19.776]  Jeffrey Epstein's right.
[01:03:19.776 --> 01:03:21.897]  Everybody has to die, including the children.
[01:03:21.897 --> 01:03:26.919]  That's why I decided to go ahead and kill this archetypal child to save the Earth from humans.
[01:03:26.919 --> 01:03:28.960]  Both the adults and the children must die.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.021]  Hail Bill Gates!
[01:03:30.021 --> 01:03:31.542]  Hail the post-human error!
[01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:32.622]  Death to all!
[01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:34.403]  We need more child death!
[01:03:34.403 --> 01:03:36.524]  Uh, things like reducing child to death.
[01:03:36.524 --> 01:03:38.705]  Uh, things like reducing child to death.
[01:03:38.705 --> 01:03:41.646]  Uh, things like reducing child to death.
[01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:50.774]  Memorial Day is here.
[01:03:50.774 --> 01:03:52.937]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[01:03:52.937 --> 01:03:57.742]  Now we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[01:03:57.742 --> 01:04:06.313]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items that weren't on sale we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well.
[01:04:06.673 --> 01:04:08.254]  For the Memorial Day Special.
[01:04:08.254 --> 01:04:09.194]  So here it is.
[01:04:09.194 --> 01:04:11.755]  Super Metal Vitality, 40% off.
[01:04:11.755 --> 01:04:13.996]  Knockout, the Great Sleep Pig, 50% off.
[01:04:13.996 --> 01:04:16.397]  Rainforce Plus, hadn't been on sale for almost 6 months.
[01:04:16.397 --> 01:04:18.218]  It is 50% off.
[01:04:18.218 --> 01:04:20.679]  Bio-Troop Selenium, 60% off.
[01:04:20.679 --> 01:04:23.420]  Shellforge, it's incredible, 60% off.
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:27.362]  And you've got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out.
[01:04:27.682 --> 01:04:36.250]  So, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139 to get these items and take advantage of this Mega Sale Memorial Day.
[01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:37.912]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[01:04:37.912 --> 01:04:44.758]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[01:04:44.758 --> 01:04:46.279]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[01:04:46.279 --> 01:04:47.180]  We are all in this together.
[01:04:58.004 --> 01:05:07.074]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chi-coms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[01:05:07.074 --> 01:05:11.039]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[01:05:11.664 --> 01:05:18.250]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:24.216]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[01:05:24.216 --> 01:05:32.663]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[01:05:33.524 --> 01:05:35.386]  They've admitted all of this.
[01:05:35.386 --> 01:05:43.014]  So remember, how does Infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen?
[01:05:43.014 --> 01:05:47.218]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[01:05:47.218 --> 01:05:48.419]  And yes, it's dystopic.
[01:05:48.419 --> 01:05:49.700]  And yes, it's scary.
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:53.925]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[01:05:53.925 --> 01:05:56.908]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[01:06:06.482 --> 01:06:12.927]  We are 69 days out from the Homeland Security CDC announcement.
[01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:18.230]  That's over two months of complete lockdown.
[01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:20.012]  And already the global depression has begun.
[01:06:20.848 --> 01:06:27.794]  Josiah Dan is a registered nurse with over 20 years experience working in the healthcare industry and he gave a very powerful speech.
[01:06:27.794 --> 01:06:30.156]  It's posted to Banned.Video and Infowars.com.
[01:06:30.156 --> 01:06:34.459]  It's being banned off YouTube, other platforms, anything viral, medical doctors and others.
[01:06:34.459 --> 01:06:36.481]  Exposing the fraud, they get banned.
[01:06:36.481 --> 01:06:41.325]  But here's the conclusion of what he had to say and we'll go to him live on this Sunday transmission.
[01:06:41.325 --> 01:06:43.787]  So here is Josiah Dan.
[01:06:43.787 --> 01:06:46.409]  Cease and desist of your current course of action!
[01:06:51.377 --> 01:06:53.598]  And this is for all of us.
[01:06:53.598 --> 01:06:57.920]  We stand on a precipice and have before us a choice.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.380]  From behind comes a torrent of destruction.
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:06.503]  A new normal that threatens the very freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and by the Bill of Rights.
[01:07:06.503 --> 01:07:10.364]  This torrent is actively washing over all that we hold sacred.
[01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:14.505]  Our families, our heritage, our faith, and our freedom.
[01:07:14.505 --> 01:07:16.326]  By God, our very way of life!
[01:07:18.226 --> 01:07:26.249]  Will we allow ourselves to be washed over the edge into the fathomless, desolate pit of tyranny, oppression, degradation, and moral decay?
[01:07:26.249 --> 01:07:35.071]  Or do we fight the flowing current and grasp others along the way to get back to the shores of liberty, justice, and the American way?
[01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:56.600]  With the great almighty Lord in heaven as my witness, I will not go plunging over the edge without fighting with every last breath, striving with every ounce of my being to arrive on the other side for the sake of my child, my wife, my family, my people, my nation, and my God!
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.662]  Open now!
[01:08:00.662 --> 01:08:02.323]  Open now!
[01:08:02.323 --> 01:08:03.344]  Open now!
[01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:15.002]  Alright, Josiah Dan joins us now to talk about the situation and where he lives and what he's witnessing and what he sees unfolding.
[01:08:15.002 --> 01:08:21.224]  But just remember when I was talking to Joe Rogan last Thursday, that's big international news now, what was the final straw for him to leave YouTube?
[01:08:22.273 --> 01:08:28.216]  It was that they were banning doctors and nurses and others that came out and said, look at the CDC's own numbers.
[01:08:28.216 --> 01:08:30.417]  This thing kills less than the flu.
[01:08:30.417 --> 01:08:31.697]  So what is this all really?
[01:08:31.697 --> 01:08:37.520]  Well, they now admit from Brazil to Europe, it's about shutting down capitalist countries.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.561]  And it's the blue cities and blue states, the communist states.
[01:08:40.561 --> 01:08:43.142]  That's how they reverse the colors that do this.
[01:08:43.142 --> 01:08:48.024]  But see his full speech at Connecticut RN speaks out about tyranny and the COVID hoax.
[01:08:48.024 --> 01:08:49.805]  That's at newswars.com.
[01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:54.253]  But joining us now is Mr. Dan Josiah.
[01:08:54.253 --> 01:08:57.356]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:08:57.356 --> 01:08:59.217]  One of the few platforms that is free.
[01:08:59.217 --> 01:08:59.638]  Thank you.
[01:08:59.638 --> 01:09:03.921]  One of the few platforms that is free so that people like you actually have a platform.
[01:09:03.921 --> 01:09:14.570]  What do you, before we get into why you went public and why you're speaking out and what's happened since you went public and what's gone viral, what do you make of the attempt to silence medical professionals in America and in Europe from your speech?
[01:09:18.631 --> 01:09:29.380]  I think that there's a lot of things going on with media outlets to suppress truth, because once people figure out what's true, you can't just stand around and do nothing anymore.
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:35.325]  And so they're really preventing the flow of truth to come from basically anywhere.
[01:09:35.325 --> 01:09:37.807]  I could ask a lot of questions, but where do we start?
[01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:42.651]  What was your process of waking up or going to a rally or speaking out?
[01:09:42.651 --> 01:09:44.933]  What is your overall view on where we currently are?
[01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:58.544]  Uh, my view on how I got to where I am is that I support lots of different organizations like Open States and Convention Estates.
[01:09:58.544 --> 01:10:05.586]  And that's actually how I found out about the rally that I attended was I got an email from Open States about a Connecticut Liberty rally.
[01:10:05.586 --> 01:10:07.707]  I was like, Oh, I'm really interested in checking this out.
[01:10:07.707 --> 01:10:12.708]  So I talked to my wife and she was comparable to going with me because we have a six month old child now.
[01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:12.948]  And, uh,
[01:10:13.635 --> 01:10:20.420]  So we attended the event and I heard some speakers say things that I knew were true and it was about everything going on.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:26.063]  And I was really appreciative of the event and the people that spoke there.
[01:10:26.063 --> 01:10:34.489]  And so I went and talked to the gentleman that had sponsored and started the event and the organization itself, ConnecticutLiberty.com.
[01:10:36.962 --> 01:10:47.463]  He had a conversation with him about being able to speak because my wife inspired me to get up there and actually do something rather than just be a passive, you know,
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.241]  Watch her.
[01:10:51.241 --> 01:11:00.688]  Could you imagine five years ago, even a year ago, hearing, Oh, if doctors or nurses get up and say what they've seen, they'll be banned on YouTube.
[01:11:00.688 --> 01:11:03.211]  They'll be banned on Facebook because it's on record.
[01:11:03.211 --> 01:11:09.075]  If the president tweets what a doctor says, they'll, they'll ban it saying, well, that's not what the UN says.
[01:11:09.075 --> 01:11:11.677]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:11:11.677 --> 01:11:12.578]  Yeah.
[01:11:12.578 --> 01:11:16.721]  Um, so about three years ago, maybe three, four years ago, um,
[01:11:18.959 --> 01:11:29.313]  My, uh, I had an event happen in my family where my mother was diagnosed with cancer and, uh, I, it drove me to search out alternate methods of, uh, of treatment and, uh,
[01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:48.941]  It was at that time that I really realized that there's a lot of censorship when it comes to actual health freedom and understanding the truth about how your body works and that there are people out there, medical professionals out there, doctors, that treat things a different way and that they actually don't have a platform to do so in states in this country.
[01:11:49.361 --> 01:11:50.282]  No, it's crazy.
[01:12:11.178 --> 01:12:17.065]  I had a very different opinion and that's kind of some of the things that started to open my eyes about what to look into and I'm a digger.
[01:12:17.065 --> 01:12:24.272]  I spent a lot of time in nursing school digging through resources online and books.
[01:12:24.272 --> 01:12:32.181]  I used to piss my wife off a lot because I would stay up to three, four in the morning finding detailed information about things that I thought were kind of crazy at the time.
[01:12:32.862 --> 01:12:35.044]  Um, so, uh, yeah.
[01:12:35.044 --> 01:12:36.365]  It's that search for knowledge.
[01:12:36.365 --> 01:12:45.672]  It's like when you find the UN's own website with thousands of pages about sterilization vaccines, they're testing on people all over the world.
[01:12:45.672 --> 01:12:48.334]  And then you tune in the news and go, Oh, that's a conspiracy.
[01:12:48.334 --> 01:12:51.896]  And you're on the UN's website and they admit they're doing it.
[01:12:51.896 --> 01:12:52.437]  Yeah.
[01:12:52.437 --> 01:12:52.817]  Yeah.
[01:12:52.817 --> 01:12:53.958]  It's craziness.
[01:12:53.958 --> 01:13:00.603]  Uh, and there, there are things that over the past 10 years, since I went to nursing school and, uh, uh, graduated,
[01:13:02.233 --> 01:13:10.879]  That was kind of the event that made me really start looking at healthcare issues because I was learning about it in school and learning about how to care for patients well.
[01:13:10.879 --> 01:13:17.324]  And I had questions about why I was expected to do particular things for myself, like flu shots.
[01:13:17.324 --> 01:13:19.506]  I don't receive a flu shot.
[01:13:19.506 --> 01:13:27.071]  I choose not to for my own medical reasons because I understand... Spend a few minutes on that without me just blurting out why I... I mean... Sure.
[01:13:31.547 --> 01:13:45.573]  When you receive a flu shot, the purpose of it, at least what we're told, is to try and protect the community at large from receiving the flu as a virus and having any detrimental impacts from it.
[01:13:45.573 --> 01:13:52.476]  And as a medical professional, they tell us, like, this is your duty to receive this vaccine so that you're protecting your patients.
[01:13:52.476 --> 01:14:00.699]  And in so doing, you're benefiting the community at large, not just in the hospital, but outside of the hospital and society.
[01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:13.495]  But when you look into research on the flu vaccine itself, you come to an understanding that things aren't as clear as what they tell you they are.
[01:14:13.495 --> 01:14:26.765]  So if you receive multiple seasons of flu shots, you actually, so say you get a flu shot two years in a row, you're more likely to actually get the flu on year three than you would have been if you had never gotten a flu shot in the first place.
[01:14:26.765 --> 01:14:29.667]  And you're actually more likely to have a more detrimental impact on your system.
[01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:33.976]  Than you would if you'd never received the flu shot.
[01:14:33.976 --> 01:14:40.520]  And it's because you're actually not receiving a conference of immunity from natural exposure.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:47.444]  So when you're exposed to a flu virus, you're exposed to it and your body recognizes it.
[01:14:47.444 --> 01:14:48.905]  It defends itself.
[01:14:48.905 --> 01:14:50.146]  It defeats it.
[01:14:50.146 --> 01:14:56.070]  And then you get conferred immunity to yourself, which is what we're talking about with like natural herd immunity.
[01:14:56.070 --> 01:15:00.693]  When you receive a vaccine, you receive a small snippet of that virus.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:14.627]  And it doesn't have the whole stranding out there to allow your body to recognize that there are, you know, more bits of DNA or RNA, depending on what kind of infection you're talking about.
[01:15:14.627 --> 01:15:19.930]  And so you don't get the conferred immunity to all the different or multiple different variants.
[01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:20.451]  Exactly.
[01:15:20.451 --> 01:15:21.171]  It never works.
[01:15:21.171 --> 01:15:27.535]  The studies show it lowers your overall immunity and then they can add Trojan horses or have mistakes and they have liability protection.
[01:15:27.535 --> 01:15:28.595]  It just works from there.
[01:15:28.595 --> 01:15:29.836]  So let me ask you this when we come back.
[01:15:31.044 --> 01:15:32.605]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:15:32.605 --> 01:15:33.965]  Because you have the U.N.
[01:15:33.965 --> 01:15:39.167]  coming out last December admitting, okay, vaccines are hurting people, there's been a cover-up, what are we going to do?
[01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:41.488]  And now you see this big explosion, this big takeover.
[01:15:41.488 --> 01:15:47.810]  Now they have the mRNA vaccines that actually go into the cell and change the body's makeup.
[01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:53.932]  So there seems to be a failing forward, a panic because they're being exposed to just power grab all of reality.
[01:15:56.383 --> 01:15:57.744]  Now it's official.
[01:15:57.744 --> 01:16:18.919]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained.
[01:16:19.759 --> 01:16:31.363]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order, where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[01:16:31.363 --> 01:16:35.945]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian, anti-human group.
[01:16:36.505 --> 01:16:44.033]  They have to put this electronic straitjacket on us before they carry out their endgame, which is global depopulation.
[01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:47.577]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[01:16:47.577 --> 01:16:54.885]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[01:16:54.885 --> 01:16:55.806]  Wake up or die.
[01:16:58.462 --> 01:17:00.963]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[01:17:00.963 --> 01:17:06.845]  And I told folks, going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[01:17:06.845 --> 01:17:09.726]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:17.068]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[01:17:17.068 --> 01:17:18.588]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[01:17:18.588 --> 01:17:21.529]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[01:17:21.529 --> 01:17:23.430]  But with the election fraud and the
[01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.810]  I don't
[01:17:47.892 --> 01:17:50.794]  Dependent on them, they do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[01:17:50.794 --> 01:17:57.277]  Get your storable food at mfortworestore.com right now while you still can.
[01:17:57.277 --> 01:17:58.858]  Memorial Day is here.
[01:17:58.858 --> 01:18:01.039]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[01:18:01.039 --> 01:18:05.822]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[01:18:05.822 --> 01:18:14.427]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items that weren't off sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well.
[01:18:14.767 --> 01:18:16.329]  For the Memorial Day Special.
[01:18:16.329 --> 01:18:17.270]  So here it is.

[01:18:44.337 --> 01:18:45.999]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[01:18:45.999 --> 01:18:52.826]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[01:18:52.826 --> 01:18:54.348]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[01:18:54.348 --> 01:18:55.249]  We are all in this together.
[01:18:57.765 --> 01:19:07.694]  What InfoWars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[01:19:07.694 --> 01:19:11.557]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[01:19:11.557 --> 01:19:18.163]  And now, open world government is being established with an endgame to depopulate the planet.
[01:19:18.883 --> 01:19:24.265]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[01:19:24.265 --> 01:19:26.866]  You must decide which side you're on.
[01:19:26.866 --> 01:19:35.809]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[01:19:35.809 --> 01:19:40.351]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[01:19:40.351 --> 01:19:41.912]  The delusions must end now.
[01:19:42.873 --> 01:19:48.275]  InfoWars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[01:19:48.275 --> 01:19:52.217]  Most people that are aware of the New World Order decide to join it out of fear.
[01:19:52.217 --> 01:19:53.557]  They are truly fools.
[01:19:53.557 --> 01:19:59.820]  We must fight this, or lose our souls.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:09.203]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:09.203 --> 01:20:09.603]  Josiah Day!
[01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:31.164]  So if you had a sheet of say 20 checkboxes for tyranny, COVID-19 clicks them all.
[01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:39.849]  A world currency, a tracking system, a way to get rid of cash, a way to control people's movements, a way to go after their free speech.
[01:20:39.849 --> 01:20:42.050]  The list just goes on and on and on.
[01:20:43.975 --> 01:20:56.406]  And now we're told, oh, if it's not the WHO, who's funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that are a front for vaccine companies that have been given liability protection, well, you don't have that speech.
[01:20:56.406 --> 01:21:04.253]  So now hundreds of medical doctors and nurses that have come out, talked about their practices and their patients and what they've seen, they've been silenced.
[01:21:04.253 --> 01:21:09.398]  What was it like for you, Josiah, Dan, again, a nurse that gave a speech a few days ago that's gone viral.
[01:21:10.595 --> 01:21:19.937]  What was it like for you to watch all these, many of them well-known, Cedars-Sinai, probably the top hospital in the U.S.
[01:21:19.937 --> 01:21:21.798]  arguably, came out and said, Trump's right.
[01:21:21.798 --> 01:21:24.598]  We have light therapy for viruses in the lungs.
[01:21:24.598 --> 01:21:26.659]  They just banned their YouTube channel.
[01:21:26.659 --> 01:21:28.439]  I mean, what's behind that?
[01:21:28.439 --> 01:21:32.380]  What was it like watching that for you?
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.141]  Like I said, it's a suppression of truth.
[01:21:34.141 --> 01:21:35.941]  It's a suppression of peer-reviewed data.
[01:21:37.087 --> 01:21:52.358]  When you realize that there are treatments out there that are effective for things and you tell people that they don't exist or that it's craziness or quackery, even though you know that the data actually demonstrates that there's truth and reality to how they function.
[01:21:52.358 --> 01:22:05.767]  We as citizens of this country particularly, but citizens of the world that see these things, we should severely start to question our governing authorities, the governing authorities of organizations like the CDC and the FDA.
[01:22:06.297 --> 01:22:13.221]  And the WHO, because there are there are problems with their authority figures.
[01:22:13.221 --> 01:22:19.064]  Many of their authority figures go back and forth between industry and then as regulators.
[01:22:19.064 --> 01:22:29.690]  So if you're ahead of the CDC and work for a pharmaceutical company, and then you become the head of the CDC, well, you have a bent that is different than someone that never worked for a pharmaceutical company.
[01:22:29.690 --> 01:22:35.654]  And then if you go back to the pharmaceutical industry after you've worked for the CDC for a couple of years, you know, your likelihood to
[01:22:36.658 --> 01:22:39.599]  Advocate at the CDC for particular vaccines.
[01:22:39.599 --> 01:22:41.680]  It's a cold, revolving door.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:42.941]  Look at Fauci.
[01:22:42.941 --> 01:22:46.142]  He's not just involved with the vaccine company making all this money.
[01:22:46.142 --> 01:22:49.183]  He got $100 million from Bill Monegate just last year.
[01:22:49.183 --> 01:22:51.684]  He helped run drills for the takeover.
[01:22:51.684 --> 01:23:02.048]  And then he's heavily involved controlling NIH funding under Obama to the very Wuhan lab on COVID-19 chimera viruses.
[01:23:02.048 --> 01:23:04.048]  I mean, wow!
[01:23:04.048 --> 01:23:05.329]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:23:05.329 --> 01:23:05.909]  It's insanity.
[01:23:07.884 --> 01:23:13.747]  So, as a registered nurse working, I mean, what are the other nurses and doctors, I mean, what percentage of them are saying, yeah, this is BS?
[01:23:13.747 --> 01:23:20.551]  Because most of the ones I've talked to are just like, yeah, this is way overblown.
[01:23:20.551 --> 01:23:25.835]  So, I think very differently than most of my peers.
[01:23:25.835 --> 01:23:27.235]  There are some people that question things.
[01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:30.157]  They're questioning about this particular event.
[01:23:30.157 --> 01:23:31.018]  Some people are.
[01:23:31.018 --> 01:23:33.059]  I wouldn't say the majority of them are.
[01:23:33.059 --> 01:23:35.921]  I've had conversations with some of my peers that are
[01:23:37.279 --> 01:23:47.448]  More advanced in their education than myself, being PAs or in other levels of healthcare, that are questioning like, why are we doing all this stuff?
[01:23:48.786 --> 01:23:54.470]  To limit people's ability to move around and to get in contact with other people.
[01:23:54.470 --> 01:24:00.213]  They ask those types of questions because the data doesn't seem to make much sense with what's happening with COVID-19.
[01:24:00.213 --> 01:24:00.713]  Exactly.
[01:24:00.713 --> 01:24:01.754]  Here it is right here.
[01:24:01.754 --> 01:24:05.736]  Lockdowns failed to alter course of pandemic, JPMorgan study claims.
[01:24:05.736 --> 01:24:09.058]  Why do you think it's the areas with the lockdowns that have the highest death rates?
[01:24:09.058 --> 01:24:14.160]  Because JPMorgan's done the numbers with their big supercomputers and they say it's a fraud.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.361]  Yeah.
[01:24:15.361 --> 01:24:15.961]  So yeah, like I said,
[01:24:17.284 --> 01:24:25.896]  The people that question are probably fewer in the healthcare community than the majority.
[01:24:25.896 --> 01:24:29.001]  The majority of people don't question exactly what's going on.
[01:24:29.001 --> 01:24:31.745]  They kind of get caught up in the hysteria and the
[01:24:32.812 --> 01:24:42.357]  They look to the CDC and they take what the CDC's recommendations are and don't actually look at the fact that, well, the CDC as a governing organization is supposed to dispense good information.
[01:24:42.357 --> 01:24:46.979]  So you're taught in medical school or in nursing school to trust what the CDC says.
[01:24:46.979 --> 01:24:50.220]  And unless you're doing what I'm doing and digging around,
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:57.643]  You don't actually have a reason necessarily to question until you see something blatant like what's happening with this.
[01:24:57.643 --> 01:25:08.248]  We know that the CDC sent out test kits that had problems that were either contaminated with the virus or were not giving us accurate data.
[01:25:08.248 --> 01:25:13.310]  And that started to make medical professionals question, well, what's going on at the CDC that this is actually happening?
[01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:30.235]  And, you know, you've got the president of Tanzania receiving testing kits, and then you're getting goats testing positive for COVID-19, which, okay, that might happen because it's potentially an animal disease, but why the heck is a piece of fruit, a pawpaw fruit, testing positive for COVID-19?
[01:25:30.235 --> 01:25:31.735]  That guy's a famous biologist.
[01:25:31.735 --> 01:25:41.118]  He figured the UN funding was fraudulent, so he sent the papaya and goat to get tested, and the kits found they were positive, showing they want the highest number possible in these tests.
[01:25:41.118 --> 01:25:41.919]  I agree.
[01:25:41.919 --> 01:25:43.179]  I agree in general.
[01:25:46.185 --> 01:25:54.147]  Since your video went viral, the speech you gave about reopening the economy, have you gotten any negative feedback?
[01:25:54.147 --> 01:25:55.387]  From who?
[01:25:55.387 --> 01:26:00.228]  Well, no, I mean, have you got any trouble at work or anything happened since your video got millions of views?
[01:26:00.228 --> 01:26:03.008]  I've been trying to not be very vocal about it at work.
[01:26:03.008 --> 01:26:07.089]  I've had some people come to me and congratulate me on what I said.
[01:26:07.089 --> 01:26:12.790]  Personally, I, at this point in time, my wife has been furloughed from her position.
[01:26:13.454 --> 01:26:16.296]  And I am the only breadwinner, uh, right now in the home.
[01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:19.377]  So I don't want to make a bad spot for myself and get fired.
[01:26:19.377 --> 01:26:21.198]  Hey, listen, you're an American.
[01:26:21.198 --> 01:26:23.819]  You have a right to come out as a citizen, not about your job.
[01:26:23.819 --> 01:26:27.901]  You have a right to say as a citizen, what you think of COVID-19.
[01:26:27.901 --> 01:26:28.482]  That is true.
[01:26:28.482 --> 01:26:33.344]  Uh, but I also don't want when I, when I announced in my speech who I was,
[01:26:33.959 --> 01:26:38.983]  I made sure that I said I'm not speaking for any corporation or organization.
[01:26:38.983 --> 01:26:49.830]  So we come back as a citizen, but also as somebody that's informed, that I want to give a chance to give a short speech again about, just to the viewers, about your points instead of me asking questions.
[01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:54.373]  Then I've got some other important points I want to hit as well, but I've got to tell you folks, that's why we're live here on this Sunday.
[01:26:54.373 --> 01:26:58.376]  I was thinking about doing a rebroadcast today, but I found out we could get Mr. Dan on the show.
[01:26:58.376 --> 01:26:59.397]  I wanted to get him on because
[01:27:00.393 --> 01:27:02.754]  His words, again, resonated with people.
[01:27:02.754 --> 01:27:04.394]  They resonated with common sense.
[01:27:04.394 --> 01:27:11.517]  And now, as we learn, the Democrats never want to reopen cities, and socialists and communists don't want to open cities anywhere in the world.
[01:27:11.517 --> 01:27:15.038]  It's really an incredible time to be alive.
[01:27:15.038 --> 01:27:24.301]  We're going to go to break here in just a moment, come back with our guest, and he can cover whatever topics he wants, and give us his own little speech, which we look forward to seeing.
[01:27:24.301 --> 01:27:26.822]  But separately, we are funded by viewers like you.
[01:27:28.203 --> 01:27:34.147]  And we sell things and promote things that we know are essential for your body, that we know are good and high quality.

[01:27:51.858 --> 01:27:55.480]  Most of the seafood that has it, it's got mercury in it, so it's not good.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:56.301]  This has no mercury.
[01:27:56.301 --> 01:27:57.842]  It's totally clean.

[01:28:17.839 --> 01:28:20.960]  Eucalyptus and then also the lavender.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.081]  And we've got the 8-pack PowerStack.

[01:28:41.386 --> 01:28:47.772]  All right, Josiah Dan, the evil nurse that exercises free speech, will let everybody have it.
[01:28:47.772 --> 01:28:50.775]  Give us a speech on the other side of this quick break.
[01:28:50.775 --> 01:28:51.416]  Stay with us.
[01:28:51.416 --> 01:28:55.100]  It's Sunday live, free, uncensored, unfiltered.
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:29:02.307]  Infowars has become a symbol, an emblem, of not just American freedom, but worldwide maverick spirit.
[01:29:02.867 --> 01:29:07.689]  It's not just myself or the host at InfoWars, or the researchers, or the journalists.
[01:29:07.689 --> 01:29:12.692]  It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines, in the arena.
[01:29:12.692 --> 01:29:21.196]  It's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make InfoWars so special because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[01:29:21.576 --> 01:29:32.745]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group, and other globalists.
[01:29:32.745 --> 01:29:40.931]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[01:29:40.931 --> 01:29:48.216]  Not a world where the establishment, who hate themselves, project their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:49.998]  I'm really excited to know that Infowars
[01:29:50.438 --> 01:29:50.698]  Thank you.
[01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:13.300]  For control.
[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:24.806]  In fact, in most cultures, they called the peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them, again, at a starving level.
[01:30:24.806 --> 01:30:29.208]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite.
[01:30:29.548 --> 01:30:46.802]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff Bezoses of the world, they're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets, living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving to death.
[01:30:46.802 --> 01:30:52.606]  Their religion is power and control, and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[01:30:52.606 --> 01:30:54.248]  We must break free from these monsters.
[01:30:56.258 --> 01:31:02.079]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[01:31:02.079 --> 01:31:09.581]  We will not have this sale that's going on right now in May until our Christmas sale comes up.
[01:31:09.581 --> 01:31:16.243]  All of our best-selling supplements are 30 to 60% off at infowarestore.com.
[01:31:16.243 --> 01:31:17.803]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.
[01:31:18.423 --> 01:31:20.424]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:31:20.424 --> 01:31:27.708]  It's got high quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known to supercharge the effects of that.
[01:31:27.708 --> 01:31:38.354]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you, no matter how old you are, no matter what color you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[01:31:38.354 --> 01:31:40.935]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[01:31:40.935 --> 01:31:43.777]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[01:31:43.777 --> 01:31:46.058]  It doesn't make them grow, it makes them shrink.
[01:31:46.858 --> 01:31:49.803]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:32:34.327 --> 01:32:36.309]  Josiah Dan is a registered nurse.
[01:32:36.309 --> 01:32:40.653]  He gave a speech up in Connecticut about reopening the economy and went viral.
[01:32:40.653 --> 01:32:45.818]  He's here with us talking about why he did it on this live Sunday show.
[01:32:45.818 --> 01:32:50.263]  But pulling back and just believing it's the most deadly thing since death.
[01:32:50.263 --> 01:32:52.405]  It's the Grim Reaper on wheels.
[01:32:54.252 --> 01:33:01.374]  It's blue cities and blue states and communist and socialist countries that are using this for a permanent martial law lockdown.
[01:33:01.374 --> 01:33:03.915]  The projections were millions dead, not 100,000 dead.
[01:33:03.915 --> 01:33:06.956]  They're putting the names of other people that died of other things on it.
[01:33:06.956 --> 01:33:13.958]  We know it's a fraud and they said, oh, 15 days to bend the curve and flatten the curve and make sure the hospitals could have beds.
[01:33:13.958 --> 01:33:15.559]  It turns out the hospitals are empty pretty much.
[01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:23.112]  And now they tell us it's about getting rid of President Trump and getting rid of capitalism and the new green deal and saving the earth.
[01:33:23.112 --> 01:33:27.654]  Speak to that, Mr. Dan, and any other points you want to make.
[01:33:27.654 --> 01:33:29.654]  You've got the floor here the next nine minutes.
[01:33:29.654 --> 01:33:32.235]  All right.
[01:33:32.235 --> 01:33:41.378]  So first off, what I would like to say is, regarding my comments before with vaccines, I am for vaccine freedom of choice.
[01:33:41.378 --> 01:33:43.219]  I'm not going to tell you what to do with your body.
[01:33:44.363 --> 01:33:52.268]  But I would gladly give you information as to how to make a good choice when it comes to choosing if you're going to vaccinate yourself for anything.
[01:33:52.268 --> 01:33:57.792]  My first word of advice would be to read vaccine pamphlets.
[01:33:57.792 --> 01:34:05.797]  Read what's in the vaccines and read what they say about what can happen in your body because they're required to give you that information when you receive a vaccine.
[01:34:05.797 --> 01:34:08.779]  Most facilities, they don't necessarily give you the vaccine
[01:34:09.178 --> 01:34:09.938]  Thank you for having me.
[01:34:33.833 --> 01:34:35.935]  Take over when we're not alive anymore.
[01:34:35.935 --> 01:34:38.537]  We want them to be able to function effectively in society.
[01:34:38.537 --> 01:34:52.687]  That includes being not mentally handicapped and potentially autistic or having mood disorders or a number of other things that may actually be a byproduct of over vaccination in general.
[01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:56.290]  The direction that you had asked about before where I see things are going.
[01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.692]  I mean, I'm a religious guy.
[01:34:58.692 --> 01:34:59.212]  I'm a Christian.
[01:35:00.388 --> 01:35:07.977]  I look at what the Bible says and I kind of evaluate things that I see in society based on my beliefs.
[01:35:07.977 --> 01:35:10.761]  What I see as true is happening around me.
[01:35:10.761 --> 01:35:12.743]  And then I look at what does the Bible say about it?
[01:35:14.269 --> 01:35:19.972]  Some very interesting comparisons about what is prophesied in the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation.
[01:35:19.972 --> 01:35:23.894]  Yeah, I said I was going to let you roll in and interrupt, but you're so on target.
[01:35:23.894 --> 01:35:30.017]  If the Q people, nothing against them, a lot of them are great people, they do some great work, but whoever the supposed Q people are, I don't trust that.
[01:35:30.017 --> 01:35:33.679]  The Q followers, they're a lot of nice folks.
[01:35:33.679 --> 01:35:39.862]  If Q was one-tenth as on target as Jesus Christ and John the Revelator, I would be following it.
[01:35:40.422 --> 01:35:44.687]  I mean, what Jesus said and what John Revelator said is like, it's not like we're having to twist it.
[01:35:44.687 --> 01:35:47.850]  It matches exactly every time.
[01:35:47.850 --> 01:35:49.432]  Yeah.
[01:35:49.432 --> 01:35:50.573]  That's the craziness.
[01:35:50.573 --> 01:35:51.534]  And that's what I was getting at.
[01:35:51.534 --> 01:35:57.420]  It's like, you know, when you see somebody advocating publicly to the entire nation and to actually the entire world.
[01:35:58.241 --> 01:36:11.011]  Um, stating that, you know, we want to tattoo you with a nanoparticle tattoo so we can track you and make sure that you're healthy, but also is going to, you know, contain all of your personal information, potentially your banking information.
[01:36:11.011 --> 01:36:14.134]  We might tie it to an electronic currency because you know what?
[01:36:14.134 --> 01:36:18.838]  You can get sick from passing around paper currency, so we're going to eliminate that and use everything electronically.
[01:36:19.438 --> 01:36:25.601]  And they cut to the MIT scientist going, Bill Gates hired us to have this chip that, you know, gets in the skin.
[01:36:25.601 --> 01:36:27.442]  And I mean, exactly.
[01:36:27.442 --> 01:36:29.683]  It's all happening.
[01:36:29.683 --> 01:36:30.544]  Yeah.
[01:36:30.544 --> 01:36:36.687]  And, you know, in the book of Revelation, it says there's going to be a mark placed on people's wrists and hands and forehead.
[01:36:36.687 --> 01:36:40.889]  And so there's direct linkages between what you see in the Bible
[01:36:41.331 --> 01:36:46.294]  And what you see is happening currently in society, and it's pretty wild to see it happening in my lifetime.
[01:36:46.294 --> 01:36:48.596]  And those that are lazy will take it right on the head.
[01:36:48.596 --> 01:36:51.238]  Those that aren't will be on the wrist.
[01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:52.939]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:52.939 --> 01:36:54.460]  Who knows what that headpiece is going to look like?
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:56.501]  But I think it has a lot to do with what we think.
[01:36:56.501 --> 01:36:56.921]  You know what I mean?
[01:36:56.921 --> 01:37:00.984]  Like this mark on the head is potentially like what you actually believe.
[01:37:02.335 --> 01:37:03.196]  Yeah, maybe it's a check.
[01:37:03.196 --> 01:37:03.856]  No, no, no.
[01:37:03.856 --> 01:37:07.258]  I'm saying the mark is your social credit score.
[01:37:07.258 --> 01:37:07.738]  Exactly.
[01:37:07.738 --> 01:37:10.100]  Your brain, your action must agree to them.
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:17.625]  That means your head is in action with them and your motion and your dynamic is in league.
[01:37:17.625 --> 01:37:22.568]  You're following in step with what the world system wants you to do.
[01:37:22.568 --> 01:37:31.294]  Which is what the Bill Gates patent says is, we'll be tracked by 5G, our every movement, and we'll be paid money according to the following orders exactly.
[01:37:31.294 --> 01:37:31.494]  Yeah.
[01:37:32.393 --> 01:37:47.860]  Yep, I mean that's definitely the direction I see things going and I hope that my willingness to stand up and say things about what is true, what I see happening in society around me, and looking at the history of my country and what
[01:37:48.882 --> 01:38:01.547]  It happened with the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the writing of the Constitution and subsequently the Bill of Rights that gives us a lot of abilities to protect ourselves from federal and state government overreach.
[01:38:01.547 --> 01:38:10.651]  Looking at what's happening with that and seeing that we're having those things destroyed and advocated, particularly by the left, that we get rid of them and some on the right doing the same thing.
[01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:15.873]  I think we need to really evaluate who we're voting for, number one.
[01:38:15.873 --> 01:38:16.553]  Number two, we need
[01:38:16.934 --> 01:38:18.935]  Educate ourselves and remember our history.
[01:38:18.935 --> 01:38:22.316]  And that's what my next speech, which I'm going to plug right now, is going to be about.
[01:38:22.316 --> 01:38:30.939]  So if anybody wants to come out and videotape me again, I'm going to be presenting another speech at the Connecticut Liberty Rally on Saturday.
[01:38:30.939 --> 01:38:32.460]  It's coming Saturday, 5.30, that being the date.
[01:38:35.914 --> 01:38:40.057]  And I think this speech is going to be even more poignant than the first one that I gave.
[01:38:40.057 --> 01:38:43.599]  There's a lot of good information in this speech.
[01:38:43.599 --> 01:38:49.463]  There's a lot of things to hopefully make people think about and analyze what's happening in our society.
[01:38:49.463 --> 01:38:51.885]  And we need to think about what's best, not just for
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:39:00.507]  You know, the community of people that we live in, what is actually good for us as individuals, for human beings, for us as family units?
[01:39:00.507 --> 01:39:03.689]  Because that's where society starts, the foundation of the family.
[01:39:03.689 --> 01:39:04.310]  Well, exactly.
[01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:10.155]  They're building a post-human world saying humans are bad and people going along with the thing is for a greater good.
[01:39:10.155 --> 01:39:10.775]  They're heroes.
[01:39:10.775 --> 01:39:11.636]  No, they're not.
[01:39:11.636 --> 01:39:15.879]  You're going along with a de-industrialization plan that makes humans obsolete.
[01:39:15.879 --> 01:39:21.304]  The globalists admit their own words and they're now admitting, oh, this is about the new green deal.
[01:39:21.644 --> 01:39:23.364]  This is about the post-human world.
[01:39:23.364 --> 01:39:25.665]  This is about cutting carbon footprint.
[01:39:25.665 --> 01:39:28.305]  This is about you can't travel if you're non-essential.
[01:39:28.305 --> 01:39:31.746]  And the establishment decides who is non-essential.
[01:39:31.746 --> 01:39:33.226]  That's beyond racism.
[01:39:33.226 --> 01:39:36.026]  It's the ultimate form of tyranny.
[01:39:36.026 --> 01:39:39.547]  Yeah, and we still have a constitution and we still got a Bill of Rights.
[01:39:39.547 --> 01:39:44.408]  And, you know, that Declaration of Independence told us a lot of information about what happened in Britain.
[01:39:44.408 --> 01:39:45.808]  And look at what's happening now.
[01:39:45.808 --> 01:39:48.929]  But if we don't enforce it, it's a dead letter.
[01:39:48.929 --> 01:39:50.809]  And that's what you're saying is we've got to enforce this.
[01:39:51.974 --> 01:39:56.936]  We as citizens in this country need to get off of our butts and stop sleeping.
[01:39:56.936 --> 01:40:06.438]  We need to realize that they're trying to destroy the very foundations of who we are as a country and subvert our sovereign authority to a global governance board.
[01:40:06.438 --> 01:40:08.559]  That makes zero sense.
[01:40:08.559 --> 01:40:12.580]  What do you make of Bolsonaro coming out and saying, he has his own communist cities.
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:17.582]  They're just locking everything down, arresting mothers trying to sell fruit for their kids to eat.
[01:40:17.582 --> 01:40:20.203]  And he's ordering the police, stop arresting them or I'm gonna arrest you.
[01:40:20.203 --> 01:40:20.983]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:40:22.889 --> 01:40:24.931]  You know what?
[01:40:24.931 --> 01:40:26.693]  I think you guys should listen to my next speech.
[01:40:26.693 --> 01:40:33.620]  I'm going to give you a little excerpt of a little teaser as to what it is going to partly contain.
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:35.902]  And then you can kind of ask me another question if you want.
[01:40:35.902 --> 01:40:37.063]  All right.
[01:40:37.063 --> 01:40:40.447]  So these are the abuses and the usurpations of which we speak.
[01:40:40.447 --> 01:40:46.012]  The will of the people has been usurped and the voice of our representatives in the state, my state of Connecticut,
[01:40:47.078 --> 01:40:48.600]  Our stores have been closed.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:49.881]  Our livelihoods declared not safe.
[01:40:49.881 --> 01:40:51.502]  By the way, I had to do this as a cliffhanger.
[01:40:51.502 --> 01:40:52.963]  We have a couple breaks an hour.
[01:40:52.963 --> 01:40:53.964]  They fired a certain time.
[01:40:53.964 --> 01:40:55.025]  Come back.
[01:40:55.025 --> 01:40:57.506]  Start over with the speech you're going to give next week.
[01:40:57.506 --> 01:40:59.328]  Josiah Mann is our guest.
[01:40:59.328 --> 01:41:05.393]  And real quickly, is the best place for people to find you CTLibertyRally.org?
[01:41:07.086 --> 01:41:10.469]  So that's the organization that I'm actually presenting at.
[01:41:10.469 --> 01:41:17.456]  For me, if you go to my Facebook page and shoot me a message, so Josiah Dan is what I go by on Facebook.
[01:41:17.456 --> 01:41:19.799]  You can look me up that way if you want to send me a message.
[01:41:19.799 --> 01:41:21.100]  Fantastic.
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:25.024]  We're going to come back, my friend, because the person at the grassroots is the most important.
[01:41:25.444 --> 01:41:27.165]  The bottom is the top, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:27.165 --> 01:41:28.566]  You're doing a great job.
[01:41:28.566 --> 01:41:31.307]  And we've got tomorrow's show coming up, which is going to be a rebroadcast.
[01:41:31.307 --> 01:41:32.708]  We'll be back live Tuesday, Lord willing.
[01:41:32.708 --> 01:41:33.789]  Please pray for us.
[01:41:33.789 --> 01:41:39.992]  Every day we're still on air is a blessing, but knowing people like Josiah is out there and that you're out there makes it all possible.
[01:41:39.992 --> 01:41:41.453]  Black, white, old, young, doesn't matter.
[01:41:41.453 --> 01:41:43.734]  You got red blood, you love God, you love justice.
[01:41:43.734 --> 01:41:45.255]  We're brothers and sisters together.
[01:41:45.255 --> 01:41:48.457]  I appreciate this great crew coming in on Sunday night to run this show.
[01:41:48.457 --> 01:41:49.618]  I love each and every one of you.
[01:41:49.618 --> 01:41:50.758]  All this great crew.
[01:41:50.758 --> 01:41:53.520]  From Savannah to Zach to Scott to everybody else, you're awesome.
[01:41:55.288 --> 01:42:04.340]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chi-coms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:08.325]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[01:42:08.951 --> 01:42:15.536]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[01:42:15.536 --> 01:42:21.501]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[01:42:21.501 --> 01:42:29.947]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[01:42:30.808 --> 01:42:32.669]  They've admitted all of this.
[01:42:32.669 --> 01:42:40.313]  So remember, how does Infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen?
[01:42:40.313 --> 01:42:44.495]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[01:42:44.495 --> 01:42:45.696]  And yes, it's dystopic.
[01:42:45.696 --> 01:42:46.976]  And yes, it's scary.
[01:42:46.976 --> 01:42:51.198]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:54.180]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:56.022]  Now it's official.
[01:42:56.022 --> 01:43:17.183]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained.
[01:43:18.024 --> 01:43:29.615]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order, where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[01:43:29.615 --> 01:43:34.219]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian, anti-human group.
[01:43:34.759 --> 01:43:42.283]  They have to put this electronic straitjacket on us before they carry out their endgame, which is global depopulation.
[01:43:42.283 --> 01:43:45.824]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[01:43:45.824 --> 01:43:53.128]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[01:43:53.128 --> 01:43:54.069]  Wake up or die.
[01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:59.630]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election.
[01:43:59.630 --> 01:44:04.231]  It is a referendum of national sovereignty against globalism.
[01:44:04.231 --> 01:44:13.973]  And Obama, Hillary, and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow President Trump's election, and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the president.
[01:44:13.973 --> 01:44:20.814]  Now, they've been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression, while China's already been open for business for more than a month.
[01:44:21.574 --> 01:44:33.660]  This is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy, and hope that we won't recognize that it is they, the New World Order, that have orchestrated this and not President Trump.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.401]  They know their crimes are coming out.
[01:44:35.401 --> 01:44:37.342]  They know the chickens are coming home to roost.
[01:44:37.862 --> 01:44:46.408]  So now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public safe from COVID-19.
[01:44:46.408 --> 01:44:52.953]  The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hoax and must be exposed if America has any hope.
[01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:54.694]  So get out there and expose this fraud.
[01:44:55.572 --> 01:45:02.153]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is.
[01:45:02.153 --> 01:45:18.016]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible, nightmarish collapse for the first world, and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the megabanks.
[01:45:18.016 --> 01:45:21.376]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, forced inoculations.
[01:45:21.376 --> 01:45:24.657]  We are now in a giant dystopia.
[01:45:25.237 --> 01:45:44.209]  But a lot of people are waking up, and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our Bill of Rights, rediscover our Constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it'll save lives.
[01:45:44.209 --> 01:45:44.749]  No.
[01:45:44.749 --> 01:45:48.811]  It's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[01:45:48.811 --> 01:45:53.694]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtue signaling, you have destroyed your lives and our lives.
[01:45:53.694 --> 01:45:54.555]  Congratulations.
[01:45:58.709 --> 01:46:15.156]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:15.156 --> 01:46:22.939]  Every time I sit down in front of this microphone and I realize that there are literally millions of people tuning in,
[01:46:26.266 --> 01:46:28.067]  Including our enemies.
[01:46:28.067 --> 01:46:34.150]  I just think, how do I explain to people, I'm not up here trying to say this to scare you.
[01:46:34.150 --> 01:46:38.012]  I'm just telling you what the globalists are really doing.
[01:46:38.012 --> 01:46:44.876]  And for those of us, like, I'll be honest, I mean, like, if I've got a buddy who's got a super hot wife,
[01:46:46.078 --> 01:46:50.661]  I feel guilty that I'm sitting there at dinner with him just thinking, my God, this woman's hotter than hell.
[01:46:50.661 --> 01:46:51.762]  And I feel guilty.
[01:46:51.762 --> 01:46:54.444]  My wife's incredibly sexy, but I mean, God made me this way.
[01:46:54.444 --> 01:46:56.925]  You know, King David was less than people's wives.
[01:46:56.925 --> 01:46:59.187]  I mean, I can't help, but that's the kind of thing I have guilt about.
[01:46:59.187 --> 01:47:03.850]  It's like women, like just, and I'm not even jealous of guys that have super hot wives or whatever.
[01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:05.331]  I'm just kind of like, I want your wife.
[01:47:06.755 --> 01:47:07.996]  And I'm being honest about that.
[01:47:07.996 --> 01:47:17.204]  I would never want to have power over people or make them poor so I felt big about it or put poison in their vaccines or enslave people.
[01:47:17.204 --> 01:47:22.548]  But when you study globalists, they want control over everybody.
[01:47:22.548 --> 01:47:24.009]  I want prosperity.
[01:47:24.009 --> 01:47:25.090]  I want freedom.
[01:47:25.090 --> 01:47:27.272]  I want justice.
[01:47:27.272 --> 01:47:28.974]  And other parts of me
[01:47:31.659 --> 01:47:47.216]  The point is, is that I'm definitely a sinner and I'll admit it, but when you study the globalists, they're so evil that those of us that aren't like that, we have a blind spot.
[01:47:47.216 --> 01:47:49.939]  Well, you better get acquainted with the devil because he's acquainted with you.
[01:47:50.814 --> 01:47:54.196]  I mean, you better get acquainted with Jesus, because this is real, folks.
[01:47:54.196 --> 01:47:56.497]  And I got a big story I didn't even get to.
[01:47:56.497 --> 01:48:02.819]  NASA discovers parallel universe, where time flows backwards.
[01:48:02.819 --> 01:48:04.720]  We already told you all of this.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:07.762]  That's in Forbes today.
[01:48:07.762 --> 01:48:09.302]  This is a simulation.
[01:48:09.302 --> 01:48:12.164]  It's a real simulation, but it's controlled by God.
[01:48:12.164 --> 01:48:18.066]  So I can rant and rave all day, and there I just told everybody, what any red-blooded man knows, that we love women.
[01:48:18.066 --> 01:48:19.447]  It's just the final equation
[01:48:22.008 --> 01:48:31.183]  The church tells you all day that's sin because they know every man sitting in the puge has lusted after somebody's wife.
[01:48:31.183 --> 01:48:35.270]  But they don't make it about banking cheating with Christ beating the money changers.
[01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:36.191]  They don't make it about
[01:48:37.225 --> 01:48:40.046]  Enslaving people, keeping them dumb to control them.
[01:48:40.046 --> 01:48:45.967]  Christ said, several little children, treat them as if they're me, because I will destroy you.
[01:48:45.967 --> 01:48:49.107]  That means not just children, but people that aren't as smart as you.
[01:48:49.107 --> 01:48:54.108]  We have to build people up when we are given more gifts than they are.
[01:48:54.108 --> 01:48:58.009]  Those gifts have been given to us to help others, not to be used against them.
[01:48:58.009 --> 01:49:01.530]  So, that's my statement, but you my friend,
[01:49:02.711 --> 01:49:07.454]  Here with us, the registered nurse up in Connecticut, who's gone super viral, exposing this tyranny.
[01:49:07.454 --> 01:49:09.775]  Another big speech coming up this Saturday.
[01:49:09.775 --> 01:49:14.438]  Mr. Dan Josiah, give us the prelude of the speech that's coming up.
[01:49:14.438 --> 01:49:15.619]  I didn't even know you had the speech ready.
[01:49:15.619 --> 01:49:16.720]  I said, give us the speech.
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:17.620]  Give us the speech now.
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:20.202]  Give us the prelude.
[01:49:20.202 --> 01:49:25.545]  Yeah, I've been working on this one since I gave the first speech, I guess.
[01:49:25.545 --> 01:49:27.646]  So here's an excerpt for you.
[01:49:27.646 --> 01:49:31.729]  And I would love to have you listen to the full speech.
[01:49:32.674 --> 01:49:36.636]  When it gets posted, okay?
[01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:39.458]  These are the abuses and usurpations of which we speak.
[01:49:39.458 --> 01:49:45.761]  The will and the voices of people have been usurped, as has the voice of our representatives in the great state of Connecticut.
[01:49:45.761 --> 01:49:55.786]  Our stores have been closed, our livelihoods declared non-essential, our personal finances put in shambles, and our many cases completely decimated.
[01:49:55.786 --> 01:49:59.268]  Our children have been forced out of our schools, funded by our tax dollars,
[01:50:00.003 --> 01:50:06.346]  And their access to the promise and guarantee of public education amidst their peers suspended for who knows how long.
[01:50:06.346 --> 01:50:17.252]  We have been denied access to private businesses to which we would otherwise have regularly frequented, many of which may never reopen, having gone out of business as a byproduct of these usurpations.
[01:50:17.252 --> 01:50:25.836]  The life's work of many of our small business owners and entrepreneurs have been destroyed, or at least severely frustrated and drastically decreased.
[01:50:25.836 --> 01:50:29.198]  The guaranteed rights of the people to peaceably assemble have been frustrated.
[01:50:29.531 --> 01:50:40.877]  The freedom of religion to peaceably assemble has been unequally applied, labeling churches and religious institutions non-essential, while allowing corporate interests like Home Depot, Walmart, Burger King, McDonald's, etc.
[01:50:40.877 --> 01:50:42.438]  to remain open for business.
[01:50:42.438 --> 01:50:48.761]  The faithful have been denied access to the sacraments, while fast food vendors freely distribute food to purchase.
[01:50:48.761 --> 01:50:49.781]  Let me be very clear.
[01:50:49.781 --> 01:50:54.604]  I am merely setting a precedent as to what has happened in our history by
[01:50:55.365 --> 01:50:59.389]  And yeah, I didn't read this to you, but it's about the Declaration of Independence.
[01:50:59.389 --> 01:51:08.697]  And we demand redress for our grievances, and that logic and rational discourse take precedence over irrational media and government-induced hysteria and fear-mongering.
[01:51:08.697 --> 01:51:20.068]  If churches be allowed to open, the apparition is forced to have temperature screenings and decreased capacity of meeting spaces, and an equal application of the law would dictate that corporations be subjected to the same.
[01:51:20.563 --> 01:51:25.385]  Otherwise, churches and religious centers would be unequally discriminated against and the law... Exactly!
[01:51:25.385 --> 01:51:27.886]  It sets the precedent to violate the First Amendment.
[01:51:27.886 --> 01:51:29.767]  There is no jurisdiction.
[01:51:29.767 --> 01:51:33.808]  It's a direct assault on the First Amendment.
[01:51:33.808 --> 01:51:34.589]  Yup.
[01:51:34.589 --> 01:51:41.632]  To the religious leaders of our communities, the pastors, priests, preachers, teachers, rabbis, clerics, imams, I have something to say.
[01:51:41.632 --> 01:51:49.695]  In the movie The Patriot, there is a scene where a pastor removes his wig and declares, a shepherd must tend his flock and at times fight off the wolves.
[01:51:50.250 --> 01:51:54.633]  Your flocks are being scattered and no longer grazed in the fields that were common to them.
[01:51:54.633 --> 01:51:59.295]  They are scattered to the hills and the foreign places depicted on their television screens.
[01:51:59.295 --> 01:52:01.337]  And the wolves are waiting at the gate.
[01:52:01.337 --> 01:52:03.358]  Please stand with your choice.
[01:52:03.358 --> 01:52:04.639]  Stand with your flocks.
[01:52:04.639 --> 01:52:11.423]  Follow the President, who not yesterday, but the day before now, has declared houses of worship essential and should open right now.
[01:52:11.423 --> 01:52:13.424]  Worship together as soon as possible.
[01:52:13.424 --> 01:52:14.705]  Follow the guidelines.
[01:52:14.705 --> 01:52:15.065]  Put open.
[01:52:15.791 --> 01:52:21.592]  There is indeed an unseen and invisible enemy at work amongst this nation, but it is not the coronavirus.
[01:52:21.592 --> 01:52:29.954]  I would submit to you that it is fear, spread through media outlets by often well-intended men and women, and the division that seeks to prevail over us.
[01:52:29.954 --> 01:52:37.976]  We all desire to attain safety and mutual respect, to care for our loved ones, and to make rational decisions as self-determining adults.
[01:52:37.976 --> 01:52:42.297]  Despite what you have been inspired to believe, we are one human race.
[01:52:42.861 --> 01:52:43.863]  Everyone is essential!
[01:53:00.663 --> 01:53:04.305]  Yes, businessmen in all sectors of the economically disenfranchised.
[01:53:04.305 --> 01:53:16.473]  We are in your communities and we will frequent your businesses, be your patrons, and stand with you against the unconstitutional overreach of executive orders that keep you mentally barred from opening your business doors.
[01:53:17.253 --> 01:53:18.794]  All right, beautifully said.
[01:53:18.794 --> 01:53:22.175]  Well, I like to build up the people that are in the grassroots having a big effect.
[01:53:22.175 --> 01:53:23.076]  You've done a great job.
[01:53:23.076 --> 01:53:29.338]  You're just as important as President Trump or anybody else out there, and I really appreciate you joining us, Mr. Dan.
[01:53:29.338 --> 01:53:31.119]  We've only got about a minute or two left.
[01:53:31.119 --> 01:53:35.561]  Anything else you'd like to add to viewers and listeners out there on this live Sunday show ahead of Memorial Day?
[01:53:35.561 --> 01:53:44.225]  Because a lot of people sacrificed their arms and legs and their bodies so we'd have some basic freedom, and it's all being just thrown to the wayside like it's garbage.
[01:53:44.225 --> 01:53:44.665]  That's right.
[01:53:45.635 --> 01:54:00.564]  So, first thing I'd like to say is anybody that's out there that is a Christian, a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and God, I would ask for you to pray for me because I'm probably going to get under some severe attacks after all this goes down.
[01:54:00.564 --> 01:54:01.645]  I hope to not lose my job.
[01:54:01.645 --> 01:54:06.968]  I hope to not have problems because I say things that my employer may not like, even though I'm not mentioning who they are.
[01:54:10.478 --> 01:54:14.279]  I want to take care of my family, I want to be a good dad, and I want to be a good husband to my wife.
[01:54:14.279 --> 01:54:19.380]  But you know you're going to lose it all if you don't speak out now.
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:27.462]  And so other people left, you're going to lose it all, we're going to lose it all, because playing it safe, you've not played it safe, but playing it safe was the old system.
[01:54:27.462 --> 01:54:32.123]  Now playing it safe is death.
[01:54:32.123 --> 01:54:34.804]  So I would ask for your support that you would pray for me.
[01:54:34.804 --> 01:54:35.424]  We will brother.
[01:54:37.586 --> 01:54:44.370]  And I think that people that are listening here that are willing to spread this message need to do so.
[01:54:44.370 --> 01:54:46.331]  Share it in whatever way you can.
[01:54:46.331 --> 01:54:47.692]  Send it out via your email.
[01:54:49.491 --> 01:54:51.972]  List that you have all your friends, because you know what?
[01:54:51.972 --> 01:54:53.972]  It's going to get blocked on social media.
[01:54:53.972 --> 01:54:56.353]  So send it out to your friends.
[01:54:56.353 --> 01:54:59.974]  It's like the only way this dog hunts or the bird flies in the wind.
[01:54:59.974 --> 01:55:01.194]  If you take action.
[01:55:01.194 --> 01:55:03.095]  All right, Josiah, Dan, thank you so much.
[01:55:03.095 --> 01:55:05.315]  We'll talk to you again next week as this unfolds.
[01:55:05.315 --> 01:55:05.776]  God bless you.
[01:55:05.776 --> 01:55:06.656]  And we thank you for your time.
[01:55:06.656 --> 01:55:08.736]  You're going to be great.
[01:55:08.736 --> 01:55:09.417]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:09.417 --> 01:55:09.977]  Thank you.
[01:55:09.977 --> 01:55:15.378]  All right, folks, I'm out of time and I didn't hit the NASA news and didn't hit the Joe Rogan news.
[01:55:15.378 --> 01:55:18.119]  I didn't hit all the rest of it, but we hit most of it.
[01:55:19.605 --> 01:55:20.726]  Great broadcast today.
[01:55:20.726 --> 01:55:23.167]  I want to thank the crew for the great job they've done.
[01:55:23.167 --> 01:55:33.812]  I want to thank the listeners and viewers and radio stations and TV stations that pick us up, despite all the threats and all the demonization and all the lies, that no, we're just telling the truth.
[01:55:33.812 --> 01:55:35.933]  We're standing up for what's right.
[01:55:35.933 --> 01:55:45.257]  COVID-19 is a patented cold virus, so that when they released it, everybody would get it, and they could make us all suspects.
[01:55:45.257 --> 01:55:47.518]  So it is a real virus, but why is it weaponized?
[01:55:47.518 --> 01:55:48.579]  It's only man-made.
[01:55:50.063 --> 01:55:50.783]  By the U.N.
[01:55:50.783 --> 01:55:55.386]  and Bill and Melinda Gates and the Chi-Coms, so they can control the response to it.
[01:55:55.386 --> 01:56:03.331]  And that's why now everybody gets infected, and then anybody that dies of car wreck or being old, they say is COVID-19.
[01:56:03.331 --> 01:56:04.672]  That's the conspiracy.
[01:56:04.672 --> 01:56:06.273]  We've cracked the code.
[01:56:06.273 --> 01:56:07.333]  We know what they're doing.
[01:56:07.333 --> 01:56:12.937]  And now Fauci's admitting, open the economy, because they know we probably are already in an irrevocable depression.
[01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:17.171]  And so now they don't want to get the blame for keeping us shut.
[01:56:17.171 --> 01:56:19.171]  That's when you know the goose is cooked.
[01:56:19.171 --> 01:56:19.952]  When the U.N.
[01:56:19.952 --> 01:56:21.992]  goes, open up now.
[01:56:21.992 --> 01:56:23.593]  Too late, bitches!
[01:56:23.593 --> 01:56:25.393]  That's not too late for us.
[01:56:25.393 --> 01:56:27.854]  It's too late for you, New World Order.
[01:56:27.854 --> 01:56:32.975]  Too late for Soros and Xi Jinping and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[01:56:32.975 --> 01:56:35.016]  You're the ones going to prison.
[01:56:35.016 --> 01:56:37.217]  You're the ones that get the blame.
[01:56:37.217 --> 01:56:38.257]  You did it!
[01:56:38.257 --> 01:56:40.357]  Nobody listens to your horror media.
[01:56:40.357 --> 01:56:42.038]  Burn in hell, globalists!
