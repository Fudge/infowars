[00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.812]  Sunday, March 8th, 2020.
[00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:30.132]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:40.475]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live, unfiltered, teleprompter-free, globalist-talking-point-free transmission.
[00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:42.796]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:55.019]  Okay, I intend to open the phones up coming up at the bottom of the hour today, and I obviously will be covering the waterfront with everyone here.
[00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:13.503]  We now see coronavirus shutting down entire countries, shutting down commerce out of China, creating a supply chain, mega massive nightmare.
[00:01:13.503 --> 00:01:22.645]  And we see the two camps, either people saying that this is no big deal and all hoax, or people saying it's the end of the world.
[00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:23.485]  Well, we already know
[00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.854]  With the supply chain and with what's happening to commerce and terrorism, it's already really hurting the global economy.
[00:01:30.854 --> 00:01:47.186]  And we know that big leftist institutions like Big Tech and South by Southwest are canceling all these big events to create the precedent that Trump better cancel all these big events and cancel school coming up as the virus spreads in the next two weeks to three months.
[00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:52.890]  It really starts heating up in two weeks if you look at all the growth models and spread models of the virus.
[00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:56.153]  So that if Trump doesn't shut down the U.S.
[00:01:56.153 --> 00:02:00.717]  economy, somehow it's his fault what happens to the economy.
[00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:10.766]  And we went back six weeks ago and said, this thing is synthetic, this thing is man-made, this thing is a big, big, big issue.
[00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:17.592]  And whether it's really a super deadly virus or not, it's being used for massive control.
[00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:21.229]  So there's no doubt that the response is a hoax.
[00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.029]  There's no doubt it's a media setup.
[00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:24.349]  There's no doubt it's man-made.
[00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.210]  That doesn't mean it doesn't kill people.
[00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.930]  But it is synthetic, so I've harped on that.
[00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:45.414]  I've spoken to that, and now we have all these big developments that we'll be getting to once we start the next segment.
[00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:48.155]  That said, we will then get into
[00:02:50.023 --> 00:02:59.827]  The ongoing spectacle of bizarreness that is the Democrat race now tightening down to Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
[00:02:59.827 --> 00:03:03.668]  What a pair of miscreant criminals.
[00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:08.850]  One completely addled and in mid-stage dementia.
[00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.350]  Got a bunch of those clips coming up.
[00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.071]  Gaffs every time he opens his mouth.
[00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:14.512]  And the other just a conman scammer.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.943]  Promising people things that are absolutely impossible to deliver.
[00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:26.666]  And the corporate media trying to wrap its mind around the fact that that's their two candidates.
[00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:29.848]  We've got that as well.
[00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:39.574]  Then we also have the news that Eric Prince has been behind a lot of funding and support and training for the folks over at Project Veritas.
[00:03:39.574 --> 00:03:40.455]  That's very interesting.
[00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:43.657]  I'm gonna dig into that some.
[00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:43.937]  Stink.
[00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:59.869]  Uyghur of the Young Turds has had a big flip out that's gone viral, and it just illustrates how communists think everything supposedly works perfect in communist countries, but then they hate capitalist countries that actually work much, much better.
[00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.511]  He's had a complete public flip out.
[00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:03.512]  We're gonna be getting to all that.
[00:04:03.512 --> 00:04:09.677]  Also, Greek border inflames as migrants keep trying to break through.
[00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:19.632]  So that's all coming up as the globalists launch their attack on the borders of Europe as well.
[00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:29.119]  2020, just a few months into 2020, just two months and eight days into 2020, is already shaping up to be spectacular in every way.
[00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:30.400]  None of it's going to be boring.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.203]  It's going to be a wild year with only 239 days left.
[00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:42.880]  Until the historic election that has so much riding on it.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.421]  And make no mistake, it's now clear.
[00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:49.084]  Whatever's really behind this virus, or however deadly it really is, it is synthetic.
[00:04:49.084 --> 00:04:51.325]  And it is designed to take down America.
[00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:55.067]  And it's the Qaikom response to them losing the trade war with the U.S.
[00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:56.688]  We'll be back in fullwars.com.
[00:05:01.508 --> 00:05:05.489]  It's really smart to get high quality, storable food at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:09.230]  It's also smart to drink filtered water with an Alexa Pure system.
[00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.331]  It's one of the highest rated out there and extremely affordable.
[00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:17.192]  And it's just as important to have your immune system boosted during times like this.

[00:05:37.598 --> 00:05:39.659]  This is our flagship product.
[00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.820]  I'm so proud of it, and I had run out of it as well.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.241]  So when I got it last week, when it came back in, I was so excited.
[00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:48.902]  It's now available at InfoWarstore.com.

[00:06:11.653 --> 00:06:12.774]  Big Brother.
[00:06:12.774 --> 00:06:14.577]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:14.577 --> 00:06:16.459]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.161]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:19.822]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.822 --> 00:06:24.548]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:45.937]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this live Sunday, March 8th, 2020 worldwide transmission with 239 days out from the election.
[00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:55.056]  There is no longer any doubt coronavirus is going to be a massive seismic event.
[00:06:55.056 --> 00:06:55.756]  It already is.
[00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:58.819]  It's going to be extremely destructive.
[00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.942]  And everybody better get buttoned down, as they say.
[00:07:02.942 --> 00:07:05.364]  Italy restricts quarter of their population.
[00:07:05.364 --> 00:07:06.285]  Travel chaos.
[00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:08.247]  CPAC virus nightmare.
[00:07:08.247 --> 00:07:10.509]  CDC has only tested 1,583 people.
[00:07:14.284 --> 00:07:19.886]  RevReport.com has some of the best wide-range reporting on what's going on.
[00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:21.806]  So does InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:07:21.806 --> 00:07:28.508]  We're going to be covering all of that in detail and what I think is really going on and what's coming next in the next segment.
[00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:30.469]  Here's just some of the headlines on that front.
[00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:34.110]  This is the one headline you really have as a takeaway.
[00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.611]  Americans divided on party lines over risk from coronavirus.
[00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:40.732]  Reuters poll.
[00:07:40.732 --> 00:07:43.893]  So it's been made political from the beginning and I got to say it.
[00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:52.399]  Man, we called it like we had a crystal ball.
[00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:57.262]  So regardless of what's really going on with it, it's been made political.
[00:07:57.262 --> 00:08:02.744]  It was political from the beginning and it's pointed at America.
[00:08:02.744 --> 00:08:07.306]  And knowing that will be half the battle.
[00:08:07.306 --> 00:08:08.267]  So that is coming up.
[00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.290]  Next segment, the videos.
[00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.231]  It's like scenes from Mad Max movies.
[00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:16.773]  People clear shelves around the country.
[00:08:16.773 --> 00:08:18.174]  What'd I tell you?
[00:08:18.174 --> 00:08:23.937]  Six weeks ago, I said, you better buy storable food because it's five times less expensive than store-bought food.
[00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:25.017]  It's high quality.
[00:08:25.017 --> 00:08:26.738]  We have it in stock.
[00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:28.619]  And it's only going to go up in value.
[00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:31.881]  And a lot of folks ordered, so they've already gotten their food.
[00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:35.003]  All the other major storable food companies back then were sold out.
[00:08:35.003 --> 00:08:37.284]  We did some test orders with major names.
[00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:38.485]  Six weeks later, none of it came in.
[00:08:39.818 --> 00:08:48.288]  As our delivery time got longer, not because we don't have food, but because we have to package it and get it out at the big factories, I told you it was going to take six to eight weeks for delivery.
[00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:53.094]  It's really four to five weeks, but we say six to eight to under promise over deliver.
[00:08:55.845 --> 00:09:03.529]  The reason you have storable food is because of the economy and wars or asteroids or earthquakes or tornadoes.
[00:09:03.529 --> 00:09:06.211]  It's just something good you have that last 25 years.
[00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:10.734]  It's sealed up in big plastic tote containers inside, sealed bags inside.
[00:09:10.734 --> 00:09:12.995]  And just because of inflation, it's a good move to make.
[00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:16.437]  And I have the biggest, most successful storable food company in the world.
[00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:30.647]  It used to be like number two or number three and they explained to me, no, we're now number one and that's in the news they are because they have quality and they get it out to you and we're partnered with them and so that's when you order at InfoWars4.com off the full catalog, get the best deal on My Patriot Supply food.
[00:09:30.647 --> 00:09:42.155]  But like I told you, you're going to see what happened in China duplicated and spread across the world because it's a globalist political attack on the nation state.
[00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:48.824]  This is a globalist temper tantrum because of patriots getting elected from Brazil to the U.S.
[00:09:48.824 --> 00:09:50.044]  to the U.K.
[00:09:50.044 --> 00:09:51.705]  and the globalists being thrown out everywhere.
[00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:56.928]  This is their answer for a planetary corporate societal reset.
[00:09:56.928 --> 00:09:59.690]  Again, that's coming up next segment.
[00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.250]  But let me get to this right now.
[00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:07.774]  You know, I've talked a lot about the emblematic nature, the illustrative nature of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
[00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:23.940]  Two aged 78-year-old men, I guess Bernie's even older, and 78, 79, and one of them has obvious dementia and cannot string a sentence together.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.162]  The other is a con man and a flagrant liar.
[00:10:28.798 --> 00:10:33.240]  And he just is saying the most insane things by the minute.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.021]  There's like six or seven of them today.
[00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:36.681]  I can't even get to them all.
[00:10:36.681 --> 00:10:38.402]  He says there's no way they're going to win the election.
[00:10:38.402 --> 00:10:40.463]  I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:10:40.463 --> 00:10:42.544]  He doesn't know Obama's name.
[00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:43.904]  He doesn't call God, God.
[00:10:43.904 --> 00:10:46.646]  He says that thing.
[00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.486]  He thinks his wife's his daughter.
[00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:52.208]  Well, I guess he does French kiss his children, so.
[00:10:53.919 --> 00:11:01.362]  But the fact that the establishment will be trying to run this guy and doesn't care what we think and is so disconnected, again, it's emblematic.
[00:11:01.362 --> 00:11:03.963]  Just like Bloomberg thought he spent $500 million.
[00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:04.724]  People love him.
[00:11:04.724 --> 00:11:05.884]  Everybody hates Michael Bloomberg.
[00:11:05.884 --> 00:11:08.986]  The guy's a joke.
[00:11:08.986 --> 00:11:11.907]  So, let's just play a few of these clips.
[00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:19.891]  Because again, this is a media and a corporate system and the Chi-Coms and Democrat constituents.
[00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:26.955]  This is who the Democrats and the Congressional Black Caucus and Kamala Harris are endorsing.
[00:11:26.955 --> 00:11:28.616]  As if their endorsement means anything.
[00:11:28.616 --> 00:11:32.178]  When you give Nobel Peace Prizes to warmongers, it becomes a joke.
[00:11:32.178 --> 00:11:34.800]  When you endorse a gibbering idiot, it makes you a joke.
[00:11:35.902 --> 00:11:36.662]  Biden.
[00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:38.963]  We can only re-elect Donald Trump.
[00:11:38.963 --> 00:11:42.225]  He goes on to say, there's no way we can get elected.
[00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:44.846]  This is announcing there's no way they can win.
[00:11:44.846 --> 00:11:46.667]  Here it is.
[00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:51.810]  Turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one about what we're for.
[00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.271]  Because we cannot get re-elect.
[00:11:54.271 --> 00:11:56.752]  We cannot win this re-election.
[00:11:56.752 --> 00:12:00.894]  Excuse me, we can only re-elect Donald Trump.
[00:12:00.894 --> 00:12:01.955]  I mean, it's sad.
[00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:02.495]  I remember
[00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:18.515]  My grandma when she was like 92, once a week going and having dinner with her, sitting around the little table at her nursing home and watching her get to where she was half as addled as him.
[00:12:18.515 --> 00:12:21.236]  I mean, this is bad, folks.
[00:12:21.236 --> 00:12:24.079]  But again, it's that the Democrats have endorsed it.
[00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:24.939]  They're supporting it.
[00:12:24.939 --> 00:12:27.421]  They believe this is going to be successful for them.
[00:12:27.421 --> 00:12:29.262]  It's beyond amazing.
[00:12:29.262 --> 00:12:30.783]  Here's another one.
[00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.885]  He also forgot Barack Obama's name.
[00:12:34.244 --> 00:12:38.508]  And then there's another clip, again, where he... Well, we'll get to all of them.
[00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.570]  Here he is, not remembering Barack Obama's name.
[00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:48.917]  Because they invaded another country and annexed a significant portion of what's called Crimea.
[00:12:48.917 --> 00:12:53.160]  He's saying that it was President... My boss.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.902]  It was his fault.
[00:12:56.857 --> 00:12:59.659]  And again, it's not out of context, it's constant.
[00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:03.801]  Here it is, Biden calls himself an O-Biden-Bama Democrat.
[00:13:03.801 --> 00:13:04.221]  Here it is.
[00:13:04.221 --> 00:13:14.347]  To all of Amy's folks, to all of Pete's folks, to all of Kamala's folks, to all the folks who have Beto's folks, I tell you what, what a gigantic difference it's made.
[00:13:14.347 --> 00:13:16.989]  We're going to unite this party and unite this country.
[00:13:22.008 --> 00:13:34.194]  If you want a nominated Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama Democrat, join us!
[00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:49.182]  If you want a nominee who will bring the party together, who will run on a positive, progressive vision for the future, not turn this primary into a campaign of negative attacks, because that will only re-elect Donald Trump if we go that route.
[00:13:49.182 --> 00:13:51.383]  If you want that, join us!
[00:13:54.858 --> 00:13:57.939]  So he's talking through another major stroke.
[00:13:57.939 --> 00:13:59.980]  He's had one that almost killed him before.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:05.442]  But it's not just that the neurological control of his speech centers are out.
[00:14:05.442 --> 00:14:07.323]  The words are out too.
[00:14:07.323 --> 00:14:08.523]  So it's dementia.
[00:14:08.523 --> 00:14:11.044]  It's dementia on top of a stroke.
[00:14:11.044 --> 00:14:19.607]  And this is who they have walking into political machine gun fire of Donald Trump, who is going to massacre him.
[00:14:19.607 --> 00:14:20.868]  But politically.
[00:14:21.926 --> 00:14:22.606]  In the election.
[00:14:22.606 --> 00:14:26.928]  But all I can say is, truth is my North Star.
[00:14:26.928 --> 00:14:34.170]  Trump, about two years ago, slurred his words, acted exhausted, stumbled around for a couple weeks, and I thought they might have been drugging his food.
[00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:34.930]  Remember?
[00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.951]  And it turned out they thought that might have been going on.
[00:14:37.951 --> 00:14:38.851]  That's how you get away with it.
[00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:40.492]  Very small dosages.
[00:14:40.492 --> 00:14:47.314]  Well, he looks deflated and very tired and almost falling asleep at the podium.
[00:14:47.314 --> 00:14:48.674]  And my mom doesn't listen to my show.
[00:14:48.674 --> 00:14:49.494]  She can't handle it.
[00:14:49.494 --> 00:14:50.695]  So she didn't get this from me.
[00:14:50.695 --> 00:14:51.475]  She was over at the house.
[00:14:53.658 --> 00:14:55.419]  Friday night.
[00:14:55.419 --> 00:14:57.300]  And she said, man, he looks deflated.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.862]  Like when people are giving speeches, he looks like he's falling asleep up there.
[00:14:59.862 --> 00:15:04.505]  So Trump is a million miles away from where Biden is.
[00:15:04.505 --> 00:15:08.288]  But at 73, my God, I'd be I'm exhausted today.
[00:15:08.288 --> 00:15:09.228]  I've been up since 4 a.m.
[00:15:09.228 --> 00:15:09.989]  working.
[00:15:09.989 --> 00:15:13.631]  I couldn't imagine being 73 at Trump's job, but I always worry about him.
[00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:22.717]  And he is really puffed up, gained some weight and needs to take some time off to work out and needs to sleep more than four hours a night.
[00:15:22.717 --> 00:15:23.158]  Don't we all?
[00:15:24.402 --> 00:15:25.669]  But I'm worried about Trump.
[00:15:25.669 --> 00:15:26.091]  He is...
[00:15:27.611 --> 00:15:30.332]  He is showing some signs of wear, and who wouldn't?
[00:15:30.332 --> 00:15:31.393]  But he's looking bad.
[00:15:31.393 --> 00:15:35.035]  We're not in a cult here, man, I'll tell you.
[00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:37.396]  Eight months ago, I said, Biden's clearly had another stroke.
[00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:38.097]  He can't talk.
[00:15:38.097 --> 00:15:39.658]  He'll never finish the race.
[00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:45.701]  And Facebook said, we're banning even using his name in a positive way, Alex Jones, because of that fake news.
[00:15:45.701 --> 00:15:46.741]  Give me a break.
[00:15:46.741 --> 00:15:50.083]  I called the Emperor's New Clothes, and I was right again.
[00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:56.387]  Infowars.com, Common Sense Today, and Tomorrow's News, a year early.
[00:15:56.387 --> 00:15:56.907]  We'll be back.
[00:16:00.234 --> 00:16:08.959]  I always promote DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the cells and empowers the telomeres and the mitochondria.
[00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:14.682]  It's the most powerful formula out there sold over the counter that is known to energize the body.
[00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:18.264]  I'm not going to jack up prices during crisis, but I am going to end up running out.

[00:16:51.797 --> 00:16:53.137]  InfoWarsTore.com is a
[00:16:53.497 --> 00:16:55.558]  Everybody needs food.
[00:16:55.558 --> 00:17:01.882]  I'm proud we're selling high quality food.
[00:17:01.882 --> 00:17:07.225]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble, this is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:11.788]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food.
[00:17:11.788 --> 00:17:20.073]  And I had long discussions this morning, over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this, right down to the folks running the plants to get the best idea we have.
[00:17:20.233 --> 00:17:23.834]  But they want me to say six to eight weeks, just so people aren't getting pissed.
[00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:30.096]  But understand, the last food company, the biggest food company, is now at hundreds of times their regular order.
[00:17:30.096 --> 00:17:34.698]  And they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week.
[00:17:34.698 --> 00:17:36.578]  And at a certain point, just saying, we're done.
[00:17:36.578 --> 00:17:39.039]  Because people aren't going to take food orders out ten weeks.
[00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:42.860]  We don't want to sit on your money ten weeks, and then just all the weirdness that comes with that.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.740]  Because we're honest.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.321]  Under-promised, over-delivered.
[00:17:45.401 --> 00:17:51.089]  But technically it's going to be six to eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took care of you so you come back again.
[00:17:51.089 --> 00:17:52.532]  We want relationships with you.
[00:17:52.532 --> 00:17:53.553]  We're not Satanists.
[00:17:53.553 --> 00:17:54.254]  We're the opposite.
[00:17:54.254 --> 00:17:55.396]  We don't screw people over.
[00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:58.320]  We believe in Jesus Christ and we've been blessed by you.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.242]  We're all in this together.
[00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:12.173]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[00:18:12.173 --> 00:18:21.638]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[00:18:21.638 --> 00:18:26.220]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.381]  The globalists have literally
[00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:27.901]  We're good to go.
[00:18:47.614 --> 00:18:50.355]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[00:18:50.355 --> 00:18:52.937]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[00:18:52.937 --> 00:18:56.038]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[00:18:56.038 --> 00:18:59.460]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[00:19:01.312 --> 00:19:06.535]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[00:19:06.535 --> 00:19:10.817]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:15.259]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:23.663]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:30.887]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[00:19:31.307 --> 00:19:34.908]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[00:19:34.908 --> 00:19:40.230]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:48.293]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[00:19:48.293 --> 00:19:53.675]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.
[00:19:53.675 --> 00:19:55.936]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.
[00:19:55.936 --> 00:19:58.477]  Get this special today at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:03.857 --> 00:20:11.519]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:32.524]  While you were sleeping They came and took it all away The lanes and the meadows The places where you used to play
[00:20:35.884 --> 00:20:39.846]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:39.846 --> 00:20:45.809]  You know, I'm going to get into the coronavirus in the second half of this segment and into the next segment and the last segment of this hour.
[00:20:45.809 --> 00:21:00.596]  And then I do intend to open the phones up for first time callers on this Sunday to give you a chance to respond to what you really think is happening in the world, the Democratic Party and the economy and the attempts to blame America and Trump for the coronavirus and all the rest of it.
[00:21:00.596 --> 00:21:02.697]  But I want to get back to Joe Biden because
[00:21:04.414 --> 00:21:10.917]  You've got Joe Biden being endorsed by the Democratic Party, and you've got them clearly trying to steal it from Bernie Sanders again.
[00:21:10.917 --> 00:21:22.603]  But Bernie Sanders really represents who the Democrats are and all the free goodies that are being offered.
[00:21:22.603 --> 00:21:24.243]  But it's all delusion.
[00:21:24.243 --> 00:21:25.724]  It's all lies.
[00:21:25.724 --> 00:21:27.885]  And it only gets worse and worse from that point.
[00:21:27.885 --> 00:21:32.107]  But then, you look at Brian Williams, a big Democrat.
[00:21:32.107 --> 00:21:33.488]  He was on TV.
[00:21:35.399 --> 00:21:35.699]  I think?
[00:21:58.018 --> 00:22:02.002]  Twenty-seven million, and it turned out it was just a few dollars each person would get.
[00:22:02.002 --> 00:22:04.624]  But they defended it.
[00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:08.288]  The original article was in the Washington Post and said, who cares about math?
[00:22:08.288 --> 00:22:09.589]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:10.931]  That's done on purpose.
[00:22:12.469 --> 00:22:14.811]  That's psychological warfare.
[00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:40.832]  But if you're going to have a party of mentally handicapped people, a party of people of dementia and of people that have screen sickness and people that are in a mesmerized, sleep-like state and run the gamut from mentally retarded from all the fluoride to just flat out out of their minds from mental illness, well then you're going to have the leader of them being someone like them.
[00:22:42.025 --> 00:22:43.385]  You don't understand a word they say?
[00:22:43.385 --> 00:22:49.748]  Well, it doesn't matter if you can't understand what Joe Biden has to say, because his followers are idiots.
[00:22:49.748 --> 00:22:51.688]  And so, it just sounds like words to them.
[00:22:51.688 --> 00:23:04.913]  You know, take care of corn pop, and fly hairs, and black kids roaches, and you can't beat Trump, and that's not my wife, that's my daughter.
[00:23:04.913 --> 00:23:06.833]  I don't know who I am.
[00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:08.454]  I mean, those are real quotes, folks.
[00:23:10.063 --> 00:23:14.904]  And then you got Sanders going, white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:23:14.904 --> 00:23:17.765]  We are going to take the rich people's money.
[00:23:17.765 --> 00:23:20.085]  Everything will be free.
[00:23:20.085 --> 00:23:21.305]  The rich people are offshore.
[00:23:21.305 --> 00:23:22.526]  You'll never get their money.
[00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:24.766]  They're funding socialism to control us.
[00:23:24.766 --> 00:23:31.707]  9% of their wealth is made up stock market numbers, leveraged.
[00:23:31.707 --> 00:23:36.008]  You take 2% out of any of these companies, they'll fold overnight.
[00:23:36.008 --> 00:23:38.469]  It's not real money.
[00:23:38.469 --> 00:23:38.969]  It's called
[00:23:40.216 --> 00:23:49.163]  Zimbabwean or Weimar Republic, where wheelbarrows of cash can't buy you a cup of coffee.
[00:23:49.163 --> 00:23:51.905]  And so that's where all this is headed.
[00:23:51.905 --> 00:23:55.308]  And the left wants to destroy the confidence in the Ponzi scheme to bring it down.
[00:23:55.308 --> 00:23:59.431]  And they think there's going to be some giant red terror crisis they're going to manage.
[00:23:59.431 --> 00:24:04.475]  It's going to give them all this power and control, but all their poop and needle and homeless ridden cities.
[00:24:06.069 --> 00:24:07.630]  Have been sucked dry by them already.
[00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:13.595]  They think they're going to manage the takeover of the biggest armed camp in the world of people that hate their guts?
[00:24:13.595 --> 00:24:21.302]  They are literally getting in a cave with a grizzly bear and swapping it upside the face over and over again.
[00:24:21.302 --> 00:24:26.566]  But again, they're a party led by a gibbering, lying, conman communist.
[00:24:29.087 --> 00:24:32.808]  Who said he dreams of raping 12-year-old girls and gang rapes.
[00:24:32.808 --> 00:24:34.188]  He writes news articles.
[00:24:34.188 --> 00:24:41.289]  I like to get what male doesn't think about gang raping with 20 men, a 12-year-old girl.
[00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:42.730]  I want to see her bound.
[00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.470]  I'm going to rape her.
[00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:51.011]  And Cink Uygur or Cink Uygur has made similar comments online.
[00:24:51.011 --> 00:24:52.312]  And so have all these people.
[00:24:52.312 --> 00:24:57.973]  It's like, no, dude, the average man doesn't think about tying down 12-year-old girls and gang raping them, dude.
[00:24:57.973 --> 00:24:58.693]  That's you, bro.
[00:25:00.186 --> 00:25:02.588]  I like raping little kids.
[00:25:02.588 --> 00:25:04.690]  It's what I do.
[00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.752]  We understand, bro.
[00:25:07.752 --> 00:25:11.835]  So speaking of that, it's a long video.
[00:25:11.835 --> 00:25:12.896]  It's like 30 minutes long.
[00:25:12.896 --> 00:25:14.017]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:14.017 --> 00:25:15.578]  Here's a short compilation.
[00:25:15.578 --> 00:25:21.402]  Shink Uyghur, Stink Uyghur, whatever his name is, freaks out at black airline employees over delayed flight.
[00:25:23.237 --> 00:25:24.338]  Getting mad over delayed flights.
[00:25:24.338 --> 00:25:26.619]  They're being told by the airline what's happening.
[00:25:26.619 --> 00:25:27.940]  They think they can fix a plane.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.321]  Then it's another problem.
[00:25:29.321 --> 00:25:30.461]  A censor says something.
[00:25:30.461 --> 00:25:32.403]  We have some of the best airlines in the world.
[00:25:32.403 --> 00:25:34.144]  We have some of the best systems in the world.
[00:25:34.144 --> 00:25:37.446]  In communist countries, if a flight's delayed, you might be there two days.
[00:25:37.446 --> 00:25:38.767]  But they all want everything free.
[00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:42.389]  This guy's worth reportedly like $50 million, but he's a communist.
[00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:48.373]  So he's flipping out at American Airlines and screaming at them because they keep thinking they're going to have a plane and they don't.
[00:25:48.373 --> 00:25:50.154]  They're not just telling you they don't have a plane for no reason.
[00:25:50.894 --> 00:25:54.315]  So again, it's another spoiled, rotten baby looking for it.
[00:25:54.315 --> 00:25:54.895]  The plane!
[00:25:54.895 --> 00:25:59.856]  The plane!
[00:25:59.856 --> 00:26:06.477]  We've been here three hours, and American Airlines sucks.
[00:26:06.477 --> 00:26:10.158]  They decided for whatever reason to screw everybody on this flight.
[00:26:10.158 --> 00:26:14.539]  It just frustrates me that some industries just get to screw you over and go, meh.
[00:26:15.339 --> 00:26:17.121]  You gotta fly at some point, right?
[00:26:17.121 --> 00:26:18.643]  And there's Gustavo!
[00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:20.825]  That's a TYT viewer.
[00:26:20.825 --> 00:26:28.373]  And I'm hungry, and I'm tired, and so, like, you know me, I get more agitated when I'm hungry and tired.
[00:26:28.373 --> 00:26:35.340]  So, look, if you guys think this is bad, wait till, if that plane doesn't actually come from the hangar in 20 minutes,
[00:26:38.041 --> 00:26:40.104]  Is the flight coming?
[00:26:40.104 --> 00:26:42.327]  Supervisor, is the flight coming?
[00:26:42.327 --> 00:26:44.890]  Supervisor, you at least gotta be honest.
[00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.572]  Is there a flight?
[00:26:46.572 --> 00:26:47.994]  Is there a plane?
[00:26:47.994 --> 00:26:49.316]  You gotta be honest.
[00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:50.757]  Is there a plane?
[00:26:50.757 --> 00:26:51.538]  Is there a plane?
[00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:05.638]  Where's the plane?
[00:27:05.638 --> 00:27:07.079]  Where's the plane?
[00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:08.620]  Is there a plane?
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.080]  Where is it?
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.181]  Where's the plane?
[00:27:11.181 --> 00:27:18.766]  You know, but listen, if we just sit here and take it, they'd have us here until six in the morning, and then they'd **** us even harder, okay?
[00:27:18.766 --> 00:27:21.707]  So I need to, you're a supervisor, aren't you?
[00:27:21.707 --> 00:27:22.828]  Where's the plane?
[00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:27.350]  No, I know, because I've been here for four hours.
[00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.811]  Don't give me this.
[00:27:28.811 --> 00:27:29.951]  Where's the plane?
[00:27:29.951 --> 00:27:31.532]  Here, I got a question for you.
[00:27:31.532 --> 00:27:35.374]  When did you make the decision that we weren't gonna have a plane?
[00:27:35.374 --> 00:27:37.014]  When did you make that decision?
[00:27:37.014 --> 00:27:38.515]  Who made the decision?
[00:27:38.515 --> 00:27:41.776]  Who made the decision that we weren't, it's funny to you, right?
[00:27:41.776 --> 00:27:43.077]  It's not funny to us.
[00:27:43.077 --> 00:27:44.458]  Who made the decision?
[00:27:44.458 --> 00:27:45.358]  Who made the decision?
[00:27:45.358 --> 00:27:46.639]  You made it.
[00:27:46.639 --> 00:27:47.679]  Well, who is it then?
[00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:48.800]  That's what I'm asking.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.660]  Whose fault is it?
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.640]  Whose fault is it?
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.721]  This goes on for too long.
[00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:53.461]  Now he tells you what he's really thinking about.
[00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:56.783]  So he wants to hurt innocent people that aren't running things.
[00:27:56.783 --> 00:27:57.483]  He's a communist.
[00:27:57.483 --> 00:27:59.784]  He doesn't understand they're not in command.
[00:27:59.784 --> 00:28:00.625]  It's the engineers.
[00:28:00.625 --> 00:28:01.765]  They don't know why the plane's broken.
[00:28:01.765 --> 00:28:04.406]  They're trying to fix it as quickly as possible.
[00:28:04.406 --> 00:28:10.109]  But now, back it up 10 seconds, he's about to tell you who he really wants to take care of, and that's animals.
[00:28:10.109 --> 00:28:12.830]  He wants to pleasure sexually, reportedly donkeys.
[00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:13.190]  Here it is.
[00:28:13.932 --> 00:28:15.253]  Is there a crew?
[00:28:15.253 --> 00:28:16.714]  Is there a plane or a crew?
[00:28:16.714 --> 00:28:20.376]  Flight 204, your plane is already on its way from the hangar.
[00:28:20.376 --> 00:28:23.558]  No, no, no, but they told us that four hours ago!
[00:28:23.558 --> 00:28:25.980]  Is it actually coming?
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.881]  Is it actually coming?
[00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:30.703]  Because I literally heard it was coming from the hangar three hours ago.
[00:28:30.703 --> 00:28:34.966]  I literally heard that!
[00:28:34.966 --> 00:28:42.851]  If I were the benevolent dictator of the world, I would legalize bestiality where you are
[00:28:44.025 --> 00:28:46.506]  Giving.
[00:28:46.506 --> 00:28:48.848]  You are your pleasuring animal.
[00:28:48.848 --> 00:28:50.449]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:28:50.449 --> 00:28:57.713]  But he doesn't want to pleasure and just be nice to the poor people at the ticket counter who have not done anything wrong.
[00:28:57.713 --> 00:28:58.153]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.835 --> 00:29:00.856]  Everybody's calling me.
[00:29:00.856 --> 00:29:08.182]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[00:29:08.182 --> 00:29:09.623]  How bad is it really?
[00:29:09.623 --> 00:29:12.325]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality storable foods.
[00:29:12.325 --> 00:29:15.288]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation, that actually still has food.
[00:29:15.288 --> 00:29:18.010]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:18.651]  They got the food.
[00:29:18.651 --> 00:29:21.493]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing.
[00:29:21.713 --> 00:29:22.234]  That's right.
[00:29:42.037 --> 00:29:46.941]  Turmeric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells.
[00:29:46.941 --> 00:29:49.703]  We have the strongest turmeric you're going to find out there.
[00:29:49.703 --> 00:29:51.484]  95% Humanoid from bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:29:51.484 --> 00:29:52.425]  That's back in stock.
[00:29:52.425 --> 00:29:55.867]  And purchases at Infolarestore.com are the highest quality supplements, desirable food.
[00:29:55.867 --> 00:29:58.729]  And you actually get them delivered in stock at Infolarestore.com.
[00:29:58.729 --> 00:29:59.430]  So get those today.
[00:30:03.687 --> 00:30:05.328]  Owl Killer in New Jersey.
[00:30:05.328 --> 00:30:06.469]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:30:06.469 --> 00:30:12.314]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again, and I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[00:30:12.314 --> 00:30:17.598]  So, that Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste and that Super Blue Whitening Toothpaste is on another level.
[00:30:17.598 --> 00:30:22.762]  I use the Super Blue in the morning and then the whitening at night, and it absorbs into your gum.
[00:30:22.762 --> 00:30:25.584]  It is by far the best product that I've ever used in my life.
[00:30:25.584 --> 00:30:28.446]  I literally just took Turbo Force on my way to the gym right now.
[00:30:28.446 --> 00:30:28.706]  I've had
[00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:36.509]  Four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:37.849]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[00:30:37.849 --> 00:30:38.809]  Support this man.
[00:30:38.809 --> 00:30:40.270]  Everything that he exposed.
[00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.690]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:42.811]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[00:30:42.811 --> 00:30:44.111]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:46.952]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[00:30:46.952 --> 00:30:48.613]  Go look it up yourself.
[00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:49.773]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[00:30:49.773 --> 00:30:50.974]  They definitely want us off the air.
[00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:51.894]  Without you, we're not here.
[00:30:51.894 --> 00:30:53.795]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[00:31:01.024 --> 00:31:02.605]  Hanuman, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:31:02.605 --> 00:31:03.726]  What do you think's really going on?
[00:31:03.726 --> 00:31:04.466]  And thanks for calling.
[00:31:04.466 --> 00:31:06.527]  So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago.
[00:31:06.527 --> 00:31:07.207]  I was getting ready.
[00:31:07.207 --> 00:31:10.970]  I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit.
[00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.612]  And I had my phone, I had my show going on, sticking it in my pocket so I could hear it.
[00:31:15.612 --> 00:31:16.893]  I wasn't using headphones.
[00:31:16.893 --> 00:31:19.174]  This lady stops, she says, who are you listening to?
[00:31:19.174 --> 00:31:19.955]  Who's that talking?
[00:31:19.955 --> 00:31:21.375]  I said, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:21.375 --> 00:31:24.737]  And she just got, her eyes got wide open and she says, really?
[00:31:24.737 --> 00:31:25.838]  I thought he was off the air.
[00:31:26.198 --> 00:31:31.344]  And, uh, I said no, and I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go.
[00:31:31.344 --> 00:31:36.210]  She wrote down, you know, Dan.video and also Infowars.com and just said she's, he's still on.
[00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:41.797]  I run into people at the grocery store, at the mall, on the hike and bike trail, and they go, oh, Alex, I used to love you.
[00:31:41.797 --> 00:31:42.938]  I wish you were still on air.
[00:31:42.938 --> 00:31:43.859]  Are you ever going to go back on air?
[00:31:43.859 --> 00:31:44.280]  And I'm like,
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.403]  We're on hundreds of radio stations, over a hundred TV stations and cable stations.
[00:31:47.403 --> 00:31:49.645]  We have our own streams at InfoWars.com and BandOnVideo.
[00:31:49.645 --> 00:31:50.546]  And they go, really?
[00:31:50.546 --> 00:31:55.150]  They said you were off the air because they took the deplatforming as off the air.
[00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.831]  No, we have our own platform.
[00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:57.772]  InfoWars!
[00:31:57.772 --> 00:31:58.613]  InfoWars!
[00:31:58.613 --> 00:31:59.534]  InfoWars!
[00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:02.892]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:02.892 --> 00:32:05.094]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:05.094 --> 00:32:07.137]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:07.137 --> 00:32:16.407]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of Infowarsstore.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best,
[00:32:17.028 --> 00:32:18.789]  Well, it gives people the best results.
[00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:22.512]  We either private label it, or we develop our own with top developers.
[00:32:22.512 --> 00:32:27.375]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[00:32:27.375 --> 00:32:30.277]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[00:32:30.277 --> 00:32:31.198]  It's incredible.
[00:32:31.198 --> 00:32:32.859]  So do yourself a favor.
[00:32:32.859 --> 00:32:35.341]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[00:32:35.341 --> 00:32:38.223]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action.
[00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:45.188]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering, thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[00:32:45.768 --> 00:32:47.049]  But you need these products.
[00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:50.110]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:54.032]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[00:32:54.032 --> 00:32:57.873]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[00:32:57.873 --> 00:33:03.356]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning, thanks to you.
[00:33:03.356 --> 00:33:05.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:39.795 --> 00:33:46.286]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:46.286 --> 00:33:48.630]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:34:01.093 --> 00:34:03.756]  That's a natural fix.
[00:34:03.756 --> 00:34:08.901]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Sunday, March 8, 2020 transmission.
[00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:23.955]  And we're here because of you, and your word of mouth, and your support, and the great affiliates across the country, and people telling folks about Band.Video and NewsWars.com forward slash show.
[00:34:23.955 --> 00:34:25.837]  We're an American band.
[00:34:25.837 --> 00:34:26.998]  We're coming to your town.
[00:34:29.468 --> 00:34:33.150]  We're gonna go after the Globalists in a big way together.
[00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.471]  We'll win it.
[00:34:34.471 --> 00:34:41.236]  But... The enemy is striking back.
[00:34:41.236 --> 00:34:46.799]  What we need is four young Chiquitas from Omaha.
[00:34:46.799 --> 00:34:51.282]  Brother starts singing the song.
[00:34:51.282 --> 00:34:54.044]  Feeling good, feeling right.
[00:34:54.044 --> 00:34:54.705]  Saturday night.
[00:34:56.816 --> 00:35:01.097]  Don't let the Gillette commercials see this or hear about it.
[00:35:01.097 --> 00:35:05.658]  They're gonna tell us that we're not allowed to ask girls out.
[00:35:05.658 --> 00:35:06.499]  That's a bad thing.
[00:35:06.499 --> 00:35:19.842]  But if you're a convicted pedophile, dressed in a clown suit and calling yourself a drag queen, and you're unannounced brought to the school by other fellow pedophiles and small children bounce on your, bounce on your crotch and call it horsey, well then it's okay.
[00:35:21.573 --> 00:35:23.674]  Yes, you cannot make this up.
[00:35:23.674 --> 00:35:32.280]  Okay, let me get to the big enchilada, the coronavirus.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:41.246]  You know, one reason I've been successful in Heinstein, I look back on, because none of it was on purpose, it was just being truthful, is that I cover a lot of diverse new news.
[00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:44.748]  But on things that I think are really important, I just am like a parrot.
[00:35:44.748 --> 00:35:49.231]  I'll just kind of add, by the way, they want your guns.
[00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:50.492]  By the way, they want your kids.
[00:35:51.664 --> 00:35:54.665]  By the way, they're lying to you.
[00:35:54.665 --> 00:35:56.006]  By the way, the vaccine's retained.
[00:35:56.006 --> 00:35:58.027]  They have a secret vaccine damage fund.
[00:35:58.027 --> 00:36:00.448]  They pay out billions of dollars secretly.
[00:36:00.448 --> 00:36:02.149]  Its existence is admitted.
[00:36:02.149 --> 00:36:03.570]  Just the cases are secret.
[00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.171]  Can I just chirp that out?
[00:36:05.171 --> 00:36:08.953]  Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
[00:36:08.953 --> 00:36:13.875]  Little important bombshell factoids that I think are most important.
[00:36:13.875 --> 00:36:17.397]  And the other big secret is, before there was the internet, there was talk radio.
[00:36:17.397 --> 00:36:19.598]  And that was the old-fashioned internet, where you just didn't call in.
[00:36:23.803 --> 00:36:27.984]  And that's the real secret ingredient, is the callers.
[00:36:27.984 --> 00:36:31.706]  Because you bring in the wild cards, the knowledge of the crowd, and the great guests.
[00:36:31.706 --> 00:36:36.407]  So, I want to open the phones up here for first-time callers.
[00:36:36.407 --> 00:36:45.691]  I do that half the time as first-time callers, so new people get a chance, because we can have like 20-something thousand calls during a show, because we have a computerized phone system that shows 20,000.
[00:36:45.691 --> 00:36:46.231]  So that's crazy.
[00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:49.532]  There's a lot of folks that are regular, who we love, with their own speed dial.
[00:36:51.032 --> 00:36:59.079]  There's a lot of people, we get it, you know, on a Sunday evening, they're sitting back, knocking back a few brews, and they're on speed dial.
[00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:01.421]  You've had more than six beers, not allowed to call in.
[00:37:01.421 --> 00:37:04.964]  Six beers today, that's the limit.
[00:37:04.964 --> 00:37:07.627]  Believe me, I get Sunday evenings back when I was a drinking man.
[00:37:07.627 --> 00:37:11.991]  You know, I quit drinking totally for four months, kind of started back a little bit, but now I'm phasing off of it.
[00:37:11.991 --> 00:37:15.314]  So I'm not judging anybody, I'm just saying here, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:37:16.184 --> 00:37:19.688]  That this is not the drinking hour.
[00:37:19.688 --> 00:37:21.510]  This is serious business.
[00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:22.712]  I'm not being patronizing.
[00:37:22.712 --> 00:37:24.414]  I'm telling myself that.
[00:37:24.414 --> 00:37:27.217]  Nobody wants to sail off into the sunset like I do.
[00:37:27.217 --> 00:37:27.578]  Believe me.
[00:37:29.431 --> 00:37:37.774]  You know what, I'm gonna hit coronavirus from a very professional perspective, and I'm gonna get my guns loaded, and I've got them loaded, but I kind of already started going off on other tangents.
[00:37:37.774 --> 00:37:45.416]  So let me hit this important point, very important point, beyond central, beyond paramount, beyond critical.
[00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:47.137]  If we don't have this, we have nothing.
[00:37:47.137 --> 00:37:51.538]  And then I'll come back and hit all of this, and then take your calls in the entire second hour.
[00:37:51.538 --> 00:37:54.159]  The toll-free number to join us on this live Sunday edition is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.562]  8-7-7-7-8-9-2-5-3-9 International Line, dial the country code and 512-646-1776.
[00:37:58.562 --> 00:37:59.282]  That number's 512-646-1776.
[00:37:59.282 --> 00:38:01.764]  Or if you like it in Darth Vader voice, we can do that too.
[00:38:01.764 --> 00:38:01.985]  8-7-7-7-8-9-2-5-3-9.
[00:38:01.985 --> 00:38:04.827]  We'll get you up and on the air, or perhaps Optimus Prime is how you'd like to hear it.
[00:38:25.962 --> 00:38:27.043]  East of the Rockies, that guy.
[00:38:27.043 --> 00:38:28.023]  That guy's got a cool voice.
[00:38:28.023 --> 00:38:30.204]  East of the Rockies, H-7s.
[00:38:30.204 --> 00:38:33.046]  East of the Rockies, H-7-7-7-8-9-2-5-3-9.
[00:38:33.046 --> 00:38:38.148]  Now we're imitating George Norian, coast to coast to him.
[00:38:38.148 --> 00:38:44.632]  Autobots, transform and call H-7-7-7-8-9-2-5-3-9 to destroy Megatron.
[00:38:44.632 --> 00:38:46.553]  Alright.
[00:38:46.553 --> 00:38:47.753]  See, I want to have fun too!
[00:38:47.753 --> 00:38:50.194]  I get it.
[00:38:50.194 --> 00:38:52.176]  Deep in my cups on the beach.
[00:38:52.176 --> 00:38:53.656]  Fishing.
[00:38:53.656 --> 00:38:54.657]  Building sandcastles.
[00:38:55.976 --> 00:38:58.238]  My babies, that sounds good, doesn't it?
[00:38:58.238 --> 00:39:02.321]  But let me give you some good news here before I come back and hit the really bad news.
[00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:10.427]  But the good news is that we know what the bad news is and we've got the jump on it and we're ahead of the curve because we've got the callers and the scientists and the researchers and our head in the game.
[00:39:10.427 --> 00:39:14.110]  And it's this.
[00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:24.118]  I never really want to talk about the successes of InfoWars because it sounds like we're just up here on a high horse saying, look how great we are, look at all the wonderful things we've done.
[00:39:24.118 --> 00:39:25.079]  And that's not what's happening.
[00:39:27.097 --> 00:39:43.664]  I need to report to you the successes we've had in freedom against tyranny so that you know not how powerful I am, but so you know how weak and pathetic and undefendable and indefensible the globalists are.
[00:39:43.664 --> 00:39:45.485]  And finally, this is a trifecta,
[00:39:46.863 --> 00:39:53.865]  Not how powerful Alex Jones is, but how un-powerful the globalists are when you have the facts.
[00:39:53.865 --> 00:39:58.506]  And how powerful we... Oh, now I'm powerful with you!
[00:39:58.506 --> 00:40:01.087]  Now I'm powerful with God's help!
[00:40:01.087 --> 00:40:04.647]  With justice and ideas and the truth and freedom together.
[00:40:04.647 --> 00:40:06.608]  Now we're powerful!
[00:40:06.608 --> 00:40:08.528]  Alex Jones isn't powerful!
[00:40:08.528 --> 00:40:10.869]  I've got a will and I don't want to be a slave and I'm willing to fight!
[00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:14.630]  I'm way more strong than the globalists, but...
[00:40:15.487 --> 00:40:19.650]  They have got everybody hoodwinked and bamboozled.
[00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.230]  But not anymore.
[00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.732]  But when you talk about the power, it's you.
[00:40:22.732 --> 00:40:27.555]  And you need to start thinking about how truly important you are.
[00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:29.356]  Because garbage in, garbage out.
[00:40:29.356 --> 00:40:34.220]  But the spark of God and energy and truth and justice and the knowledge of good.
[00:40:35.233 --> 00:40:39.335]  We'll elevate your psyche, your soul, your IQ, everything.
[00:40:39.335 --> 00:40:40.916]  And that's the big secret.
[00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:51.742]  But the globalists can activate a group residence to bring down our harmonics, which is a scientific thing, not some type of mojo or magic.
[00:40:51.742 --> 00:40:55.604]  There's an Internet of Minds connected, the group collective.
[00:40:55.604 --> 00:40:59.627]  They know how to jack into that and lower its frequency to control us.
[00:40:59.627 --> 00:41:03.009]  But God knows how, and if we tap into that to boost it.
[00:41:03.789 --> 00:41:06.033]  And so there's a battle right now between those two things.
[00:41:06.033 --> 00:41:09.158]  But I'm going to tell you, we are the zeitgeist.
[00:41:09.158 --> 00:41:12.623]  InfoWars is the flaming white hot tip of the spear.
[00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:29.081]  We together launched the entire anti-globalist nationalist movement worldwide and are credited by Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, Balasaro, everybody as being the detonator, the initiator.
[00:41:29.081 --> 00:41:31.263]  And the enemy knows that too, that's why they come after us.
[00:41:31.263 --> 00:41:32.104]  Us.
[00:41:32.104 --> 00:41:33.825]  The audience, myself, together.
[00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:34.386]  Us.
[00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:37.628]  The guests, the crew, all of us.
[00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:37.989]  And then,
[00:41:39.076 --> 00:41:50.441]  We exposed the whole globalist operation, the pedophile rings, and the New World Order, and now we're at the tip of the spear again exposing this whole fake virus.
[00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:51.901]  It's a real virus.
[00:41:51.901 --> 00:41:55.163]  It's man-made, and the response is synthetic.
[00:41:55.163 --> 00:41:58.964]  And we're doing it again because God gave us the tools to fight evil.
[00:41:58.964 --> 00:42:07.748]  We just have to be directed towards God like the North Star, have the will, have the action, build, and be steadfast, and everything happens when you've done that.
[00:42:08.348 --> 00:42:16.750]  When you have the intellect, when you have the patience, when you have the spirit, when you have the community, the fertile soil, to do what we've done, it's incredible.
[00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:25.172]  And that's why the enemy wants to change the narrative and say we're racist, or say we're this, or say we're that, or we're Russian agents, because they know it's not true.
[00:42:25.172 --> 00:42:33.574]  We're the populist Americans, unifying everyone around liberty and justice and God and family, and we're the ones that have the power!
[00:42:33.574 --> 00:42:34.394]  You can look at us!
[00:42:35.074 --> 00:42:36.114]  We speak!
[00:42:36.114 --> 00:42:36.955]  We have strength!
[00:42:36.955 --> 00:42:37.735]  We have honor!
[00:42:37.735 --> 00:42:38.475]  We have will!
[00:42:38.475 --> 00:42:40.796]  We're not stumbling around like zombies!
[00:42:40.796 --> 00:42:44.658]  Liberty lovers, regardless of what color they are, have fire in their eyes!
[00:42:44.658 --> 00:42:54.562]  They're beautiful in what they say and do, because we have God, like we're a stained glass window, shining through us, through that rose-colored darkling.
[00:42:54.562 --> 00:42:55.743]  It's incredible.
[00:42:55.743 --> 00:42:56.883]  We are the winners.
[00:42:56.883 --> 00:42:58.044]  We are the future.
[00:43:00.205 --> 00:43:02.089]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[00:43:02.089 --> 00:43:03.913]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[00:43:03.913 --> 00:43:07.440]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs, spiritually.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.484]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[00:43:09.484 --> 00:43:11.048]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[00:43:12.665 --> 00:43:13.145]  in a fight
[00:43:43.145 --> 00:43:44.626]  I want to go after the globalists.
[00:43:44.626 --> 00:43:51.869]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[00:43:51.869 --> 00:43:57.771]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family and your family, because we're in this together!

[00:46:02.386 --> 00:46:06.007]  Having firearms, knowing how to use them, and being self-sufficient.
[00:46:06.007 --> 00:46:08.348]  And learn how to hunt, and learn how to garden.
[00:46:08.348 --> 00:46:09.908]  I mean, it's just what we're meant to do.
[00:46:09.908 --> 00:46:11.129]  It feels good when we do it.
[00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:13.029]  But we do sell high-quality, affordable food.
[00:46:13.029 --> 00:46:16.170]  I told my Patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:17.170]  I said, I think it's gonna be really big.
[00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:18.630]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.391]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to
[00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:21.851]  We're good.
[00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:38.248]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:13.712 --> 00:47:30.440]  But if you're aware of the mind control, then you are able to be aware of its manipulations and you can train your mind to override it.
[00:47:41.775 --> 00:47:51.604]  And then just like mountain climbing or mountain biking or hiking or jogging or swimming or fighting, you get better and better and better and better and better at it.
[00:47:51.604 --> 00:47:55.488]  Instead of being oppressed by all of it, you learn to navigate it and make it a game.
[00:47:55.488 --> 00:47:57.850]  You make it a joke.
[00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:07.019]  And your brain learns to then not enjoy bad things happening, but really enjoy it.
[00:48:08.308 --> 00:48:12.713]  Like, you don't look for it, and you don't like it, but then you do that alchemy where, oh, really?
[00:48:12.713 --> 00:48:14.014]  I enjoy this.
[00:48:14.014 --> 00:48:19.681]  And then that's when you really start overcoming, and that's when your brain starts going, and really weaponizing.
[00:48:19.681 --> 00:48:21.142]  Weaponizing.
[00:48:21.142 --> 00:48:28.270]  I mean, I can't even now, after 25 years, 26 years of war with these people, it was longer than that, but I've been on air 26 years now, it's just like...
[00:48:29.133 --> 00:48:39.783]  My problem is that I can project into any problem or any operation and then have so many facts to draw on that it becomes exhausting because we're not omnipresent like God.
[00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:43.146]  We're able to look into any problem and do incredible things.
[00:48:43.146 --> 00:48:53.435]  We're supercomputers, electrochemical supercomputers, but still it's limited because you can look into any avenue, but you can't look into all avenues at the same time, can you?
[00:48:54.517 --> 00:48:58.480]  You can probably do anything you want in life, you just can't do everything as they say.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:04.064]  Okay, let me do my best here to try to sum this up in a very calm way.
[00:49:04.064 --> 00:49:16.433]  9-11 was real.
[00:49:16.433 --> 00:49:23.499]  Planes flew into the Pentagon and flew into the World Trade Center's Tower 1 and 2.
[00:49:25.475 --> 00:49:29.058]  A large projectile hit the Pentagon and two planes hit the towers.
[00:49:29.058 --> 00:49:40.948]  And I studied it and made five films, written a book about it and interviewed NSA top people and CIA and firefighters and police that were there and it happened.
[00:49:40.948 --> 00:49:42.049]  When we exposed
[00:49:43.288 --> 00:49:45.791]  The fact that there were anomalies and cover-ups and stand-downs.
[00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:52.900]  The media said, Alex Jones says nobody died on 9-11 and that no plane said it.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:58.848]  That was a minority of people saying holograms that were put out there, we later learned, most of them by the CIA.
[00:49:58.848 --> 00:50:01.911]  It came out to discredit the whole movement.
[00:50:02.847 --> 00:50:11.151]  And later there were even articles in the National Post in Canada where they admitted that leftist professors had gone out and done that because they thought it would damage the view of government.
[00:50:11.151 --> 00:50:13.592]  And so they thought it was the best thing to do was cover it up.
[00:50:13.592 --> 00:50:28.099]  So what do you do when I'm pointing out, hey, the head of the Labor Department, Transportation Department said they were in the bunker and saw Dick Cheney order the stand down, told Congress that.
[00:50:28.099 --> 00:50:32.121]  Well, you just say, well, Alex Jones says space beams blew it up.
[00:50:34.685 --> 00:50:40.049]  So why am I talking about coronavirus and 9-11?
[00:50:40.049 --> 00:50:41.369]  9-11 was real.
[00:50:41.369 --> 00:50:42.650]  It killed 3,000 people.
[00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.631]  It was a new Pearl Harbor.
[00:50:44.631 --> 00:50:46.112]  Radical Islam is real.
[00:50:46.112 --> 00:50:47.813]  They do attack people.
[00:50:47.813 --> 00:50:48.694]  They were involved.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:51:08.713]  What piggybacked on the Islamists' planning it were a bunch of shadowy agencies and globalist operations that ordered to stand down and put bombs in the buildings and put bombs in Building 7 that was the second largest CIA headquarters in the world after Lanley, Virginia.
[00:51:12.526 --> 00:51:17.408]  And I interviewed the Deputy Head of Emergency Management, and a week later he was dead.
[00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:19.248]  He said, yeah, there were bombs, they told us.
[00:51:19.248 --> 00:51:28.851]  They were on the news saying, we're going to blow up Building 7, and then interviewed cops that said, yeah, it was over the Red Cross radios, get back, they're going to blow up Building 7.
[00:51:28.851 --> 00:51:31.452]  And then the media spun it that I said cops blew it up.
[00:51:31.452 --> 00:51:33.273]  The Red Cross didn't blow it up.
[00:51:33.273 --> 00:51:36.034]  Red Cross is the most secretive intelligence agency in the world.
[00:51:36.034 --> 00:51:37.634]  It's the oldest Western agency.
[00:51:37.634 --> 00:51:39.335]  It's about 700 years old at least.
[00:51:40.635 --> 00:51:42.036]  Well, the Hospitallers are even older.
[00:51:42.036 --> 00:51:43.256]  That's where the word hospital comes from.
[00:51:43.256 --> 00:51:45.157]  But that gets into a bunch of history.
[00:51:45.157 --> 00:51:47.098]  That's a Vatican secret society, the Hospitallers.
[00:51:47.098 --> 00:51:50.259]  But who can go behind enemy lines?
[00:51:50.259 --> 00:51:52.120]  Doctors, emergency people, the Red Cross.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.100]  You know, you don't attack that.
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.381]  But what is really the Red Cross?
[00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:55.601]  That was the Crusader Cross.
[00:51:55.601 --> 00:51:56.782]  I'm not saying the Crusaders did it.
[00:51:56.782 --> 00:52:00.743]  My point is, I have the news clips.
[00:52:00.743 --> 00:52:01.804]  I've played them a hundred times.
[00:52:01.804 --> 00:52:02.624]  Anybody can pull them up.
[00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:14.210]  CNN on two channels, BBC on two channels, saying we're going to blow up building 7 so it doesn't fall, 47 story building, and hurt other buildings.
[00:52:15.583 --> 00:52:17.744]  I was driving that to have been on air all day long.
[00:52:17.744 --> 00:52:20.166]  I drove two miles to get a pizza.
[00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:23.508]  I'm listening to CBS Radio, back when we still had it, 20 years ago.
[00:52:23.508 --> 00:52:28.050]  And they announced on CBS, they're going to have a controlled demolition in five minutes.
[00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:31.372]  And I'm listening on the radio, they had a countdown!
[00:52:31.372 --> 00:52:34.074]  And they blew it up while I was eating pizza driving back!
[00:52:35.717 --> 00:52:44.459]  I run in on the microphone at my house, I was broadcasting on GCN like 20 hours live that day, and I run and I say, I just heard CBS say they blew up building 7, Solomon Brothers building.
[00:52:44.459 --> 00:52:51.061]  Everybody starts calling in, yeah we heard it too, but see, in 2001 nobody internet archived live shows.
[00:52:51.061 --> 00:52:54.942]  And then it became a conspiracy theory that I had said that.
[00:52:54.942 --> 00:53:01.184]  And I had Mother Jones and, you know, Time Magazine attack me and go, Jones claims a building was blown up.
[00:53:01.184 --> 00:53:02.464]  That just, that's not true.
[00:53:04.289 --> 00:53:11.876]  Then about six years later, the globalists don't even think, BBC and all of them start releasing on 9-11 the archives of the full day.
[00:53:13.812 --> 00:53:14.752]  And guess what?
[00:53:14.752 --> 00:53:21.314]  CBS, CNN, BBC, ABC, NPR.
[00:53:21.314 --> 00:53:22.134]  I made a film about it.
[00:53:22.134 --> 00:53:22.935]  I have it all in there.
[00:53:22.935 --> 00:53:24.275]  It's like 30 minutes of film.
[00:53:24.275 --> 00:53:28.996]  All announced that the government's going to blow up Building 7.
[00:53:28.996 --> 00:53:32.097]  Now, I don't know what really went on with 9-11.
[00:53:32.097 --> 00:53:37.799]  I just know I was shoving pizza in my face driving home 60 miles an hour on streets that were 20 miles an hour.
[00:53:37.799 --> 00:53:38.639]  I mean, I shouldn't have been.
[00:53:40.196 --> 00:53:44.039]  You're trying to get home to say, hey, they just blew up a building.
[00:53:44.039 --> 00:53:47.801]  You can't wire a building in a couple hours.
[00:53:47.801 --> 00:53:52.224]  So, you're tuning in, you're saying, Alex, what's this have to do with the coronavirus?
[00:53:52.224 --> 00:53:54.525]  And I'll get to all the technicals and go to your calls next hour.
[00:53:54.525 --> 00:53:58.868]  But this is what it has to do with it.
[00:53:58.868 --> 00:54:03.852]  I don't know exactly what happened with 9-11.
[00:54:03.852 --> 00:54:08.835]  I just know they blew up a 47-story building that day and then told us they never said it.
[00:54:10.612 --> 00:54:16.876]  And I've got all the newscasts saying it.
[00:54:16.876 --> 00:54:23.400]  And I've got newscasts, BBC jumped the gun an hour, 57 minutes, and said it had fallen before it did.
[00:54:25.526 --> 00:54:26.546]  Jane Graham here.
[00:54:26.546 --> 00:54:29.308]  The building has fallen to its exact footprint, pancaking.
[00:54:29.308 --> 00:54:36.411]  The Solomon Brothers, 47 stories, that would be the tallest building anywhere on the West Coast, has fallen due to fires.
[00:54:36.411 --> 00:54:41.433]  Right before they said, we're going to blow it up, she goes, no, actually, we're not blowing it up.
[00:54:41.433 --> 00:54:43.234]  It fell down.
[00:54:43.234 --> 00:54:45.695]  It's still standing.
[00:54:45.695 --> 00:54:50.217]  No building of that type had never fallen from fire.
[00:54:50.217 --> 00:54:52.478]  Underwater laboratories, all of them said it was impossible.
[00:54:53.629 --> 00:54:54.770]  You want me to play the news clips?
[00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:57.892]  I can play it where it's behind her and she says it's falling down.
[00:54:57.892 --> 00:55:00.113]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:55:00.113 --> 00:55:05.777]  So, this is the key to the riddle of the virus.
[00:55:05.777 --> 00:55:09.059]  I don't know exactly what's going on.
[00:55:09.059 --> 00:55:12.882]  But I know it's man-made with the HIV delivery system.
[00:55:14.141 --> 00:55:15.583]  Cut into it.
[00:55:15.583 --> 00:55:17.446]  And major universities have come out.
[00:55:17.446 --> 00:55:20.089]  And the Senate Intelligence Committee has come out and said that.
[00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:24.195]  And when we were reporting it six weeks ago, the news would go, Jones needs to be shut down.
[00:55:24.195 --> 00:55:25.196]  No one's saying it.
[00:55:25.196 --> 00:55:26.678]  I have all the reports you've seen.
[00:55:26.678 --> 00:55:29.922]  Everybody knows this.
[00:55:29.922 --> 00:55:30.964]  But you're not supposed to go there.
[00:55:33.186 --> 00:55:36.627]  Yeah, there's the Indian University scan, but other universities found the same thing.
[00:55:36.627 --> 00:55:54.354]  Other universities found, they had even better scanners, electron microscopes, with the CRISPR to analyze what they scanned, and they said, it's got the protein injection points, the slices, of when you plug it in, it leaves the residue.
[00:55:54.354 --> 00:55:56.355]  And it's exactly what the Indian University said.
[00:55:57.585 --> 00:56:00.026]  They've got some of the top scientists, as everybody knows.
[00:56:00.026 --> 00:56:02.227]  They said, this is like Frankenstein.
[00:56:02.227 --> 00:56:03.888]  It's cut in.
[00:56:03.888 --> 00:56:05.069]  It'd be like, I'm a white dude.
[00:56:05.069 --> 00:56:10.991]  If someone like grafted another head on, it was a black dude, you'd go, not only are you not supposed to have two heads, that's a black dude's head.
[00:56:10.991 --> 00:56:12.312]  That's not even the same thing.
[00:56:12.312 --> 00:56:13.132]  It's not even the same.
[00:56:13.132 --> 00:56:16.614]  I mean, folks, this is ridiculous.
[00:56:16.614 --> 00:56:19.155]  And then the hype and the unified propaganda.
[00:56:19.155 --> 00:56:23.757]  And I said, watch him say Trump didn't do anything and use it against him and the economy.
[00:56:23.757 --> 00:56:24.518]  And now they're doing that.
[00:56:26.553 --> 00:56:29.255]  It's fake, it's staged, it's synthetic.
[00:56:29.255 --> 00:56:30.996]  Doesn't mean the virus doesn't kill.
[00:56:30.996 --> 00:56:34.818]  I'm saying it's man-made, it was released, it's all plotted, it's all planned.
[00:56:34.818 --> 00:56:39.782]  Italy and South by Southwest and Big Tech that are all globalists, all leftists, leftists now run Italy.
[00:56:41.004 --> 00:56:52.996]  They're all using this as a cover for globalist martial law worldwide to turn the public against each other and to create hysteria and fights as the cover for driving Trump from office and other nationalists.
[00:56:52.996 --> 00:56:54.318]  And that's what this is.
[00:56:54.318 --> 00:56:55.419]  It's conclusive.
[00:56:55.419 --> 00:56:58.162]  And you can set your watch and warrant by it.
[00:56:58.162 --> 00:57:00.224]  You can bet your bottom dollar on it.
[00:57:00.224 --> 00:57:02.406]  This is big, bigger than 9-11.
[00:57:03.973 --> 00:57:07.176]  Real people died, but it was all a big spectacle.
[00:57:07.176 --> 00:57:08.497]  One plane hits, you all tune in.
[00:57:08.497 --> 00:57:10.739]  Another plane hits when everybody's watching.
[00:57:10.739 --> 00:57:11.680]  Then they collapse.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.163]  Then you're so stunned, you don't notice these other buildings blown up around it.
[00:57:16.826 --> 00:57:18.567]  And countdowns to blow him up.
[00:57:18.567 --> 00:57:21.229]  And then all the wars and the police stayed out of it.
[00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:24.811]  And now the Islamic invasion of Europe was supposed to stop all that.
[00:57:24.811 --> 00:57:31.254]  And you sit there and you watch it and you go, oh, well this is meant to change our way of life.
[00:57:31.254 --> 00:57:32.675]  It's meant to totally take down the West.
[00:57:32.675 --> 00:57:33.616]  They're criticizing Trump.
[00:57:34.436 --> 00:57:42.784]  You know, just a month ago for trying to stop flights here, but the UN was praising China for killing people at checkpoints and praising Russia for closing their border.
[00:57:42.784 --> 00:57:44.625]  This was meant to hit us!
[00:57:44.625 --> 00:57:45.326]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:45.326 --> 00:57:46.027]  Hour number two.
[00:57:46.027 --> 00:57:47.067]  Stay with us and spread the word.
[00:57:49.853 --> 00:57:50.874]  Everybody's calling me.
[00:57:50.874 --> 00:57:58.219]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[00:57:58.219 --> 00:57:59.640]  How bad is it really?
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.341]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, storable foods.
[00:58:02.341 --> 00:58:05.403]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that actually still has food.
[00:58:05.403 --> 00:58:08.025]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[00:58:08.025 --> 00:58:08.666]  They got the food.
[00:58:08.666 --> 00:58:13.049]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing, and that's drink purified water.
[00:58:13.049 --> 00:58:13.809]  That's pray.
[00:58:13.809 --> 00:58:14.510]  Let's get focused.
[00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:16.471]  Let's not be stressed out because you're prepared.
[00:58:16.471 --> 00:58:19.093]  And that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10,
[00:58:19.753 --> 00:58:20.073]  I think so.
[00:58:50.713 --> 00:58:59.437]  I always promote DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the cells and empowers the telomeres and the mitochondria.
[00:58:59.437 --> 00:59:05.159]  It's the most powerful formula out there sold over-the-counter that is known to energize the body.
[00:59:05.159 --> 00:59:08.740]  I'm not going to jack up prices during crisis, but I am going to end up running out.

[01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:07.294]  We did inspire, um, Ministry in those last good albums they did.
[01:01:07.294 --> 01:01:10.175]  And had, uh, we had a Ministry on a few times.
[01:01:10.175 --> 01:01:12.555]  They say two people will survive a nuclear war.
[01:01:12.555 --> 01:01:13.035]  Two things.
[01:01:13.035 --> 01:01:18.977]  That's cockroaches and the lead singer of, uh, Ministry.
[01:01:18.977 --> 01:01:19.977]  Burning inside.
[01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:21.537]  Oh, here it is.
[01:01:21.537 --> 01:01:22.877]  Here's the best part.
[01:01:22.877 --> 01:01:24.178]  We have another liner comes in with this.
[01:01:24.178 --> 01:01:28.258]  It goes, from the front lines of the information war.
[01:01:28.258 --> 01:01:29.819]  Then he goes, love it.
[01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:30.779]  We'll play that next segment when we can.
[01:01:34.403 --> 01:01:36.845]  Listen, I'm gonna keep listening to it so we have to turn it off.
[01:01:36.845 --> 01:01:41.527]  I've had some fun since junior high listening to ministry.
[01:01:41.527 --> 01:01:43.008]  I was a very good choir boy.
[01:01:43.008 --> 01:01:45.890]  I said all my prayers.
[01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:47.391]  I was always very good.
[01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:52.353]  I never had any fun listening to ministry.
[01:01:52.353 --> 01:01:54.995]  Driving through cornfields at 100 miles an hour in a Jeep when I was 12.
[01:01:54.995 --> 01:01:57.216]  All right, let's stop right there.
[01:01:57.216 --> 01:02:00.838]  And who knows what we were doing?
[01:02:00.838 --> 01:02:02.199]  We're not cool like Timothy Leary.
[01:02:03.004 --> 01:02:06.265]  Who knows what we were up to.
[01:02:06.265 --> 01:02:07.745]  Alright, I'm going to stop.
[01:02:07.745 --> 01:02:10.486]  Your calls are lined up and we really look forward to taking them.
[01:02:10.486 --> 01:02:14.227]  And I'll get to Craig and Brandon and Joni.
[01:02:14.227 --> 01:02:15.207]  Great cousin named Joni.
[01:02:15.207 --> 01:02:16.848]  Maybe that's Joni from Texas.
[01:02:16.848 --> 01:02:23.329]  And Jim and Ron and Andy and Matt and Wesley and Paul and Taylor and Lisa.
[01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:26.310]  We're going to get to every single one of you here today.
[01:02:28.442 --> 01:02:32.043]  And then John Bounce shot a first-rate report that really needs to be seen.
[01:02:32.043 --> 01:02:37.305]  It's at Bandai Video, dealing with the fact that it could cripple our medical system.
[01:02:37.305 --> 01:02:39.286]  Coronavirus could implode the healthcare system.
[01:02:39.286 --> 01:02:42.988]  That's really what it's designed to do, especially with what people demand here.
[01:02:42.988 --> 01:02:43.688]  They want so much.
[01:02:43.688 --> 01:02:50.511]  In China, they just say... By the way, did we ever get the footage of the major apartment building collapsed in China?
[01:02:50.511 --> 01:02:56.173]  Where they were making coronavirus people quarantine?
[01:02:57.735 --> 01:02:58.776]  They probably blew that up.
[01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:04.020]  I mean, you don't just think a building just collapses because there's people inside.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.841]  And they're not letting them take the garbage out?
[01:03:05.841 --> 01:03:07.743]  How's garbage gets in, garbage doesn't get out?
[01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:10.424]  Maybe there's so much garbage, and then the whole building collapsed.
[01:03:10.424 --> 01:03:11.405]  I don't know, man.
[01:03:11.405 --> 01:03:12.706]  All I know is all hell's breaking loose.
[01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:14.047]  There's another report Gregory did.
[01:03:14.047 --> 01:03:17.229]  It already aired during the week, but man, it is so good.
[01:03:17.229 --> 01:03:21.693]  Looking at how coronavirus is the death of globalism, not the death of the nation state.
[01:03:21.693 --> 01:03:24.615]  But they're trying to spin the whole thing like globalism is the answer.
[01:03:27.208 --> 01:03:28.789]  This is the big takeaway.
[01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:31.291]  This is a major World War event.
[01:03:31.291 --> 01:03:32.773]  This is 21st century warfare.
[01:03:32.773 --> 01:03:35.575]  This is how new wars are fought in the 21st century.
[01:03:35.575 --> 01:03:37.236]  It is man-made.
[01:03:37.236 --> 01:03:39.538]  And we need a major debate about that in the news.
[01:03:39.538 --> 01:03:46.244]  And we need that issue forced out into the open.
[01:03:52.614 --> 01:03:55.435]  We need that, because they don't want us on air.
[01:03:55.435 --> 01:03:57.997]  They don't want you able to call in on air.
[01:03:57.997 --> 01:04:01.198]  And I'm not being patronizing, like, they don't want you to be able to call in.
[01:04:01.198 --> 01:04:10.363]  The show's important because you guys bring up stuff that I never even would have thought of, or I meant to cover, and you bring it up right at the perfect time.
[01:04:10.363 --> 01:04:15.085]  That's why I'm trying to get the show more caller-based, because it's just amazing.
[01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:16.826]  Those are the shows I like to listen to and rebroadcast.
[01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:23.056]  Only frustration is I've got to add comments, and you've got to add comments, or add pleasantries, and then we don't get to everybody.
[01:04:23.056 --> 01:04:30.423]  So when we come back, I'll hit a few new items with the coronavirus, give you my statements, then we're going to go to your phone calls.
[01:04:30.423 --> 01:04:33.686]  Bam, bam, bam, wham, slam.
[01:04:33.686 --> 01:04:34.827]  Thank you, ma'am.
[01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:36.408]  We're going to get to it.
[01:04:36.408 --> 01:04:39.651]  Got a lot of cable to fix here, as they say, in the
[01:04:40.552 --> 01:04:42.134]  Big Lebowski, you know what?
[01:04:42.134 --> 01:04:43.856]  You can guess what happens next.
[01:04:43.856 --> 01:04:45.798]  Yeah, he fixes the cable.
[01:04:45.798 --> 01:04:48.320]  And I gotta get out of here and go fix cable myself.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.442]  Doing a lot of cable repair jobs today.
[01:04:50.442 --> 01:04:51.984]  Like a boxer, I probably should.
[01:04:51.984 --> 01:04:56.168]  But I admit it, the good Lord has given us a lot of good things in this world.
[01:04:56.168 --> 01:04:57.570]  And I am a cable man.
[01:04:59.454 --> 01:05:00.295]  Rich in Alabama.
[01:05:00.295 --> 01:05:01.196]  Rich, thanks for calling.
[01:05:01.196 --> 01:05:02.176]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:05:02.176 --> 01:05:02.937]  Appreciate it.
[01:05:02.937 --> 01:05:05.599]  First thing, I love the turbo force.
[01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:09.162]  I drive truck for a living, and it's amazing.
[01:05:09.162 --> 01:05:14.007]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing.
[01:05:14.007 --> 01:05:15.628]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[01:05:16.569 --> 01:05:21.276]  I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 8-10 hours.
[01:05:21.276 --> 01:05:25.001]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drinking coffee.
[01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:28.867]  And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[01:05:28.867 --> 01:05:32.212]  I'll, you know, I'll pop a knockout and I'm out cold.
[01:05:32.712 --> 01:05:39.715]  Well, that's when we went out to a top developer who didn't want his name on it, and I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10-hour energy be?
[01:05:39.715 --> 01:05:41.015]  Is that possible?
[01:05:41.015 --> 01:05:46.877]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time-released.
[01:05:46.877 --> 01:05:50.219]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product.
[01:05:50.219 --> 01:05:53.540]  So, that's why TurboForce has such a great effect.
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:56.201]  And so, I really appreciate you, and I'm glad that you like TurboForce.
[01:06:13.601 --> 01:06:14.802]  For your mind.
[01:06:14.802 --> 01:06:16.923]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:16.923 --> 01:06:18.083]  Because there is a war on.
[01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:18.703]  For your mind.
[01:06:18.703 --> 01:06:23.946]  I am 100% 20-20 clear that the coronavirus has been made, that Communist China working with globalist clients and different factions launched it,
[01:06:41.772 --> 01:06:48.515]  To cover up their defeat in the trade war, try to shut down Taiwan and try to embarrass President Trump and bring down the U.S.
[01:06:48.515 --> 01:06:57.498]  economy, because in the trade war with China we brought down theirs because it was so one-sided, because they were engaged in military operations financially against us.
[01:06:57.498 --> 01:07:00.660]  America is at war with Communist China, with Hollywood and the left.
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.103]  They openly say America was never great, it will never be great.
[01:07:05.103 --> 01:07:17.592]  And anyone that sides with the Chai Khans or Hollywood, blaming President Trump or blaming America with this virus, is engaged in acts of aiding and abetting the enemy in a time of war.
[01:07:17.592 --> 01:07:19.193]  That's fact!
[01:07:19.193 --> 01:07:21.875]  You know, you've got your free speech all day and I back it 100%!
[01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:22.375]  Until you work for
[01:07:27.372 --> 01:07:32.776]  The Chinese, the Russians, the EU, some globalist operation.
[01:07:32.776 --> 01:07:39.762]  And if I found any evidence of Russians being involved in our business, I'd come after them so fast it'd make your head spin.
[01:07:39.762 --> 01:07:43.805]  Faster than that twinkle in your mother's eye when she met your father.
[01:07:43.805 --> 01:07:45.767]  I'm about as Russian as I am an Easter Bunny.
[01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:53.057]  They're not involved in anything but trying to stabilize their country and kick out the same globalists we're under attack by.
[01:07:53.057 --> 01:08:01.086]  So in that, Putin has been a trailblazer, and I salute him for his fight for his nation and his people in fighting the sexualization of their children, and I wish Russia well.
[01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:03.611]  I wish the Chinese people well.
[01:08:03.611 --> 01:08:06.173]  They are under incredible communist control.
[01:08:06.173 --> 01:08:10.497]  Their government's killed more of their people than Hitler and Stalin and Mao.
[01:08:10.497 --> 01:08:12.258]  Well, Hitler and Stalin could ever imagine.
[01:08:12.258 --> 01:08:16.461]  Mao killed 80 million of those or so, another 20 million or so.
[01:08:16.461 --> 01:08:19.764]  The Chinese government admits were killed by other Chinese communist leaders.
[01:08:19.764 --> 01:08:25.648]  But the Chai Koms have killed more than Hitler, Stalin, and Lenin combined.
[01:08:25.648 --> 01:08:27.250]  It's incredible.
[01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:28.651]  And it's just accepted now.
[01:08:28.651 --> 01:08:29.791]  And of course it comes out in the news.
[01:08:30.578 --> 01:08:33.624]  That's Trump pushing back now.
[01:08:33.624 --> 01:08:41.879]  Nike and Apple have slave factories where 2 million Muslims are in slave camps?
[01:08:41.879 --> 01:08:42.560]  In Mongolia?
[01:08:44.008 --> 01:08:47.831]  And again, I don't want to be under Islam, but I don't want to exterminate Muslims.
[01:08:47.831 --> 01:08:51.775]  And the Mongolian Muslims are, like, nice.
[01:08:51.775 --> 01:08:59.361]  And it's not their fault 800 years ago Muslims came into Mongolia and took it over, like Pakistan or other areas.
[01:08:59.361 --> 01:09:00.482]  They're not expansionists.
[01:09:00.482 --> 01:09:01.884]  They were doing crap to the Chai Koms.
[01:09:04.209 --> 01:09:20.528]  And the Chi-Coms have two million of them in death camps with public executions on video and they're making Apple accessories and Google accessories and it's all just, oh well, it's okay because the head of Google is Indian and you know, the head of Apple's gay.
[01:09:20.528 --> 01:09:24.393]  It's like, well, if you run death camps, as long as you hop around and go, ugh.
[01:09:26.801 --> 01:09:29.862]  Imagine you run giant death camps.
[01:09:29.862 --> 01:09:34.783]  If Hitler wore a pink outfit and like sashayed around like, I like weenies.
[01:09:34.783 --> 01:09:36.063]  Sorry, I'm ranting here, folks.
[01:09:36.063 --> 01:09:37.464]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:09:37.464 --> 01:09:42.045]  Seriously, if Hitler did gay porn, they'd say just murder everybody.
[01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:43.705]  Hell, son, go ahead.
[01:09:43.705 --> 01:09:49.527]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:09:49.527 --> 01:09:50.667]  This is out of control.
[01:09:56.032 --> 01:10:04.276]  And it's not based in reality, but that shows how the left, with successive approximation, the Bible talks about giving over to grand delusion.
[01:10:04.276 --> 01:10:08.738]  And once you accept that 2 plus 2 equals 10, well you'll accept anything!
[01:10:09.642 --> 01:10:29.711]  And once you accept that a man can have a baby, like CNN says, and once you accept that biological men can win the Olympic running, and the high school, and the college, and the wrestling, and the... I mean, I've watched these videos of a huge, like, 270-pound dude that I'd be worried about just ramming down small women in rugby.
[01:10:32.577 --> 01:10:34.959]  And it's hailed as the most brave thing ever.
[01:10:34.959 --> 01:10:42.665]  Or in the UFC, a biological man gets in the ring and beats the snot out of women.
[01:10:42.665 --> 01:10:44.987]  I mean, breaks their jaws, their noses.
[01:10:44.987 --> 01:10:49.531]  It's just a man, just like, both fists together, just hammering women.
[01:10:49.531 --> 01:10:53.014]  And they go, oh, and I see the headlines.
[01:10:53.014 --> 01:10:58.058]  It's the most brave thing ever.
[01:10:58.058 --> 01:11:01.181]  If they can get you to accept that,
[01:11:03.646 --> 01:11:06.487]  Well, of course you're gonna accept Joe Biden.
[01:11:06.487 --> 01:11:10.968]  And when Joe Biden goes live now, on purpose, I tune in.
[01:11:10.968 --> 01:11:16.150]  Because it's a gaffe every 10... I mean, he can't talk!
[01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:22.812]  He's gone!
[01:11:22.812 --> 01:11:25.412]  And in what society... Yeah, roll some more of that footage.
[01:11:25.412 --> 01:11:27.333]  You have like 6'5 dudes against 5'5 women, running them over.
[01:11:31.817 --> 01:11:35.798]  Pushing them down to the ground and everyone calls them brave.
[01:11:35.798 --> 01:11:40.099]  Since when is men beating up on women tough?
[01:11:40.099 --> 01:11:44.481]  Only with the left.
[01:11:44.481 --> 01:11:46.501]  So, we'll go to break in four minutes.
[01:11:46.501 --> 01:11:48.842]  I'll come back and go write your calls to balance the transmission.
[01:11:51.021 --> 01:12:03.353]  Man, again, yes, it's hype, ladies and gentlemen, that we should shut everything down, even if it's a 2% kill rate.
[01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:07.157]  That's probably exaggerated because it's only looking at people who are already sick and are in the hospital.
[01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:07.937]  Whatever.
[01:12:07.937 --> 01:12:09.019]  You know why people are scared of it?
[01:12:09.019 --> 01:12:09.759]  It's man-made.
[01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.181]  It has the HIV delivery system.
[01:12:12.341 --> 01:12:13.342]  On record, that's not debated.
[01:12:13.342 --> 01:12:21.789]  Like, they go, oh, don't listen to Jones and the Senate Intelligence Committee and to the Indian universities and the German universities and all these other ones and the U.S.
[01:12:21.789 --> 01:12:24.251]  universities that say, yeah, it's clearly manufactured.
[01:12:24.251 --> 01:12:31.837]  You can see, you know, the protein insertion points and the pea shuttle and all of it.
[01:12:31.837 --> 01:12:33.418]  Everything leaves a mark.
[01:12:33.418 --> 01:12:35.480]  It's got the trajectory, the rifling on it.
[01:12:42.506 --> 01:12:52.271]  What is the response going to be in the supply chain and the breakdown of society?
[01:12:52.271 --> 01:12:58.775]  So, yes, the enemy is hyping it to make it as worse as possible because they launched it.
[01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:01.516]  This is the most important thing I've said this month.
[01:13:01.516 --> 01:13:02.797]  I've tried to quantify this finally.
[01:13:02.797 --> 01:13:07.760]  I've just been literally racking my brain for days trying to quantify this as simply as possible.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.420]  I'm going to say it this way.
[01:13:10.404 --> 01:13:14.426]  The virus is real.
[01:13:14.426 --> 01:13:16.968]  It's the projectile, it's the weapon.
[01:13:16.968 --> 01:13:21.311]  Both culturally, economically, spiritually, and physically.
[01:13:21.311 --> 01:13:29.576]  But what's synthetic is the hype pushing the fear of the virus because that's the whole point of the virus.
[01:13:29.576 --> 01:13:37.681]  And so people think that you counter the virus by saying it's no big deal, but then you get set up with
[01:13:39.355 --> 01:13:42.699]  You're the ones that covered it up and let it get out of control.
[01:13:42.699 --> 01:13:45.483]  You see the setup?
[01:13:45.483 --> 01:13:49.848]  So yeah, Trump sees it as it's man-made, it's hyped up, it's meant to create fear and panic.
[01:13:49.848 --> 01:13:51.611]  Well, you just counter that with no fear or panic.
[01:13:52.839 --> 01:14:02.404]  Except then when it turns out to be lethal and cause big problems, and all these private corporations shut down all these events to create more panic, then they can blame you for not having a big enough response.
[01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:07.987]  And that's why the left's all lining up to have big giant responses, so they can say they had the big giant response and Trump didn't.
[01:14:07.987 --> 01:14:10.668]  And that's in the Reuters poll, they're already phrasing it well.
[01:14:10.668 --> 01:14:19.273]  Democrats think it's the end of the world, Trump says it's fine.
[01:14:19.273 --> 01:14:20.834]  And so how do you simply quantify that?
[01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:47.641]  They're hyping the deadly virus, the globalists, the CHICOMS, the Deep State, are hyping the deadly virus that they engineered, that they released, that they let the CHICOMS incubate, to then launch against us, the UN called for our borders and airplanes to stay open, our airports, well everybody else shut down, that right there was a big tell, and now sure enough they're hoping it destroys the economy on every major so-called news program and on Bill Maher.
[01:14:49.676 --> 01:14:56.718]  And so Trump can't come out and say, oh, let me counter their hype of the virus by saying it's no big deal, it's a problem.
[01:14:56.718 --> 01:15:06.360]  Because when it becomes a real problem by the hype itself, he'll then be left holding the bag and look like he was behind the curveball instead of coming out and saying it's man-made.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.540]  Obama sold it to him in 2015.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.821]  Here's the Journal of Science freaking out about it.
[01:15:17.173 --> 01:15:19.394]  China lied to us and didn't tell us it was this bad.
[01:15:19.394 --> 01:15:20.635]  It's all their fault.
[01:15:20.635 --> 01:15:21.195]  And you know what?
[01:15:21.195 --> 01:15:21.775]  Trump's listening.
[01:15:21.775 --> 01:15:22.976]  He started doing that Friday.
[01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:24.597]  So, you know, we're going to be okay.
[01:15:24.597 --> 01:15:28.278]  But let me tell you, that's why they want us off the air, because I'm not trying to make myself important.
[01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:31.380]  I don't know why we're always the ones that are right.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:35.462]  But I guess we're the ones that aren't controlled, because all he's got is that swamp advising him.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.684]  We will destroy the globalists together.
[01:15:44.684 --> 01:15:46.727]  God has sent us.
[01:15:46.727 --> 01:15:48.790]  God has sent you!
[01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:53.396]  So now, tell the world, you are the prophets!
[01:15:58.812 --> 01:16:01.253]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[01:16:01.253 --> 01:16:08.257]  Humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world.
[01:16:08.257 --> 01:16:10.158]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[01:16:10.158 --> 01:16:25.305]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant Cloward and Piven program.
[01:16:25.785 --> 01:16:33.648]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government, inner coronavirus.
[01:16:33.648 --> 01:16:40.791]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people
[01:16:40.871 --> 01:16:44.533]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[01:17:03.681 --> 01:17:07.083]  Now, can somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[01:17:07.083 --> 01:17:07.663]  Yeah.
[01:17:07.663 --> 01:17:09.364]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[01:17:09.364 --> 01:17:10.224]  I love women.
[01:17:10.224 --> 01:17:11.845]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[01:17:11.845 --> 01:17:13.226]  You may have problems with her.
[01:17:13.226 --> 01:17:14.486]  You may get a divorce.
[01:17:14.486 --> 01:17:15.107]  You may whatever.
[01:17:15.107 --> 01:17:19.869]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful and I loved.
[01:17:20.129 --> 01:17:34.059]  Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storable foods, we've got the best out there because I want you to get a great result and to come back again and again as a customer and fund our political, spiritual operations against the globalists.
[01:17:34.059 --> 01:17:38.923]  So if you want storable foods and everybody else is sold out, and you want them delivered to your door, you want them to be high quality,
[01:17:39.343 --> 01:17:41.224]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:17:41.224 --> 01:17:43.084]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[01:17:43.084 --> 01:17:44.145]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:17:44.145 --> 01:17:44.985]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:18:05.154 --> 01:18:10.484]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:18:10.484 --> 01:18:12.387]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:13.670]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:14.411]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:16.884]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:18:16.884 --> 01:18:19.585]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[01:18:19.585 --> 01:18:20.745]  I don't want them to win.
[01:18:20.745 --> 01:18:23.666]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:26.767]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[01:18:26.767 --> 01:18:29.927]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[01:18:29.927 --> 01:18:33.728]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[01:18:33.728 --> 01:18:35.309]  These will change your life.
[01:18:35.309 --> 01:18:36.709]  Go check out the tumor products.
[01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:38.710]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:39.410]  Check it all out.
[01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:41.350]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:43.131]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[01:18:43.131 --> 01:18:44.331]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[01:18:44.611 --> 01:18:46.095]  You get great products at the same time.
[01:18:46.095 --> 01:18:48.580]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:50.746]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[01:18:50.746 --> 01:18:53.853]  Take action now and fund the InfoWar for your own future!
[01:18:59.346 --> 01:19:02.611]  This should really be easier than it is.
[01:19:02.611 --> 01:19:04.734]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[01:19:04.734 --> 01:19:07.217]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[01:19:07.217 --> 01:19:14.388]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work, that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see
[01:19:14.728 --> 01:19:23.932]  How amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic.
[01:19:23.932 --> 01:19:28.975]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen.
[01:19:28.975 --> 01:19:37.099]  Fluoride's the bad halogen and people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like
[01:19:37.759 --> 01:19:42.764]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[01:19:42.764 --> 01:19:50.450]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you, folks, get it.
[01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:51.631]  It's amazing.
[01:19:51.631 --> 01:19:55.214]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[01:19:55.214 --> 01:20:00.859]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[01:20:00.859 --> 01:20:03.502]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:26.478 --> 01:20:28.619]  From the front lines.
[01:20:28.619 --> 01:20:30.020]  Oh, yes.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:32.601]  I've always wanted that and God gave it to me.
[01:20:32.601 --> 01:20:34.182]  Thank you, God.
[01:20:34.182 --> 01:20:34.762]  Thank you!
[01:20:34.762 --> 01:20:39.384]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:05.367 --> 01:21:10.149]  But the Southern Providence Law Center and ADL says there is no new world order.
[01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:11.669]  There is no replacement migration.
[01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:13.770]  There is no fluoride in the water.
[01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:17.011]  There is no secret vaccine damage fund.
[01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:21.613]  All right.
[01:21:21.613 --> 01:21:22.893]  I was brainstorming last segment.
[01:21:22.893 --> 01:21:28.035]  I'm going to save this to go to your calls.
[01:21:28.035 --> 01:21:32.077]  The hype, the propaganda, the unification,
[01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:54.086]  The choreography, the synchronization, the scripting of these globalist governments, Hollywood, the Chi-Coms, Big Tech, South by Southwest that I've, I mean, I know the people that run that anti-American scum of the earth.
[01:21:54.086 --> 01:21:59.791]  I mean, you talk about trash.
[01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:01.733]  And every group canceling big events.
[01:22:03.237 --> 01:22:10.442]  Every group hyping up into the world, Italy now run by socialists, is socialist and globalist and communist.
[01:22:10.442 --> 01:22:30.797]  To create the precedent that if you don't lock cities down, if you don't do all this, it's your fault, you cause it to spread, so that when Trump doesn't do it because he thinks it's hyped up, they can activate the leftist sleeper cells to engage in violence and arson and all the things they admit they've been gearing up for, all the Project Veritas undercover video, and all the things we've seen, it's crazy.
[01:22:31.789 --> 01:22:32.390]  We're good to go.
[01:22:51.155 --> 01:22:59.657]  The president can't say we've had a perfect response to coronavirus with only a couple thousand people tested and everything's fine and, you know, this is like the flu.
[01:22:59.657 --> 01:23:02.738]  No, the flu kills one-tenth of one percent, maybe.
[01:23:02.738 --> 01:23:04.598]  The number is two percent with this right now.
[01:23:04.598 --> 01:23:10.900]  Probably, that's probably hyped up because, again, it's who comes to the hospital and who's already sick, but that's still a high number, man.
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:12.640]  Two percent show up with this and they're dying.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.581]  That's not good.
[01:23:14.581 --> 01:23:16.241]  You don't want this, okay?
[01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.842]  So, this thing's got some real punch behind it.
[01:23:18.842 --> 01:23:19.642]  Is it end of the world?
[01:23:19.642 --> 01:23:19.782]  No.
[01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:27.006]  The real threat is the hype of it, and so it's out of that attack that we know this is the globalist move.
[01:23:27.006 --> 01:23:30.107]  It's completely obvious, there's no debating it, and it's man-made.
[01:23:30.107 --> 01:23:34.368]  Now, I've said that probably 20 times today, and I'm going to stop.
[01:23:34.368 --> 01:23:36.709]  But if Trump doesn't get out ahead of this, I don't know.
[01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:39.289]  I'm not going to tell the President how he should do it.
[01:23:39.289 --> 01:23:41.010]  I know the President's smart and got a lot of smart folks.
[01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:47.712]  I've been saying for over a month, he better come out and point out that China lied about how bad it was up front, so that's why our response was sluggish.
[01:23:47.712 --> 01:23:48.452]  Pompeo did it Friday.
[01:23:51.329 --> 01:23:52.930]  And I know the White House listens.
[01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:54.370]  That's good.
[01:23:54.370 --> 01:24:01.454]  But this is not like me up here saying I'm the Grand Carnac, like on Johnny Garson, where he'd hold up the envelope and say, here, let me see what it says.
[01:24:01.454 --> 01:24:04.055]  You don't know.
[01:24:04.055 --> 01:24:09.057]  The Democrats are foaming at the mouth wanting a recession, foaming at the mouth to blame this.
[01:24:09.057 --> 01:24:11.158]  So it's ours to lose.
[01:24:12.708 --> 01:24:18.414]  And I think if Trump gets out ahead of it and says, well, we don't want quarantines, we don't want mass shutdowns, but we may have to.
[01:24:18.414 --> 01:24:20.276]  FEMA's already preparing for that.
[01:24:20.276 --> 01:24:21.417]  So he's out ahead of it.
[01:24:21.417 --> 01:24:24.900]  All right.
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:25.661]  I'm going to leave it at this.
[01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:32.168]  I already sell the very best supplements and products out there that have been documented and proven to boost immunity.
[01:24:33.052 --> 01:24:35.893]  PQQ, CoQ10 are on record.
[01:24:35.893 --> 01:24:38.915]  You can make claims on those because they're seen basically as drugs.
[01:24:38.915 --> 01:24:40.055]  They're over-the-counter.
[01:24:40.055 --> 01:24:41.836]  They clean out your cells.
[01:24:41.836 --> 01:24:42.976]  They regrow mitochondria.
[01:24:42.976 --> 01:24:44.557]  They make telomeres last longer.
[01:24:44.557 --> 01:24:50.320]  We have the highest quality you're going to find of PQQ and CoQ10 with other known compounds that boost it in DNA Force+.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.222]  And it's at Infolwerestore.com, 40% off and sold out for months.
[01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:54.763]  It's back in.
[01:24:54.763 --> 01:24:56.885]  We're going to probably sell it very quick.
[01:24:56.885 --> 01:24:58.646]  I'm going to keep it at 40% off.
[01:24:58.646 --> 01:25:04.331]  Our Super Silver Wound Gel is patented at American Nanotech Organization, sold over-the-counter, approved for over-the-counter.
[01:25:04.331 --> 01:25:06.112]  We're the only folks allowed to private label it.
[01:25:06.112 --> 01:25:06.613]  We have it.
[01:25:07.813 --> 01:25:09.014]  And it's at mforswear.com.
[01:25:09.014 --> 01:25:17.260]  We have the nano silver and the super silver toothpaste, the whitening toothpaste and in the super blue toothpaste, that's tea tree and iodine as well.
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:27.326]  All of that strengthens the body's main barrier to disease and that's the mouth into the esophageal and into the lungs as well and the breathing canal there.
[01:25:29.474 --> 01:25:32.115]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, InfoWareStore.com.
[01:25:32.115 --> 01:25:36.396]  Even though I'm close to selling out of the Super Silver, we've still got Super Blue.
[01:25:36.396 --> 01:25:39.277]  I'm keeping it at 50% off until they sell out.
[01:25:39.277 --> 01:25:43.018]  More is coming in, it looks like, in the middle of April.
[01:25:43.018 --> 01:25:45.279]  The Immune Gargle, sold out.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:54.205]  And Walmart went and ordered two million things of it, I was told, last week from our supplier, private label for them.
[01:25:54.205 --> 01:25:56.226]  And Walmart's going to have it in a month or so.
[01:25:56.226 --> 01:25:57.307]  We have it back in next week.
[01:25:57.307 --> 01:25:58.588]  But see how we're trailblazing?
[01:25:58.588 --> 01:26:01.970]  What we sell gets picked up and put out by Walmart.
[01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:04.792]  I mean, because this is a real deal, folks, this nanosolar.
[01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:08.774]  So that's the VAT wheelers rollout from Denver on Tuesday.
[01:26:08.774 --> 01:26:10.736]  We'll have it back in stock on Friday.
[01:26:10.736 --> 01:26:12.417]  But we're cutting edge.
[01:26:13.257 --> 01:26:14.077]  Everything we do.
[01:26:14.077 --> 01:26:15.238]  I mean, it's just, it's true.
[01:26:15.238 --> 01:26:16.278]  Because we're not controlled, folks.
[01:26:16.278 --> 01:26:17.799]  There's no teleprompter up here.
[01:26:17.799 --> 01:26:19.359]  I'm not getting orders from headquarters.
[01:26:19.359 --> 01:26:23.361]  I'm researching and having guests on and taking calls and just living my life.
[01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:25.342]  I'm in command.
[01:26:25.342 --> 01:26:30.724]  Just like you're in command when you don't follow what the globalists just say is the edict, how the world works.
[01:26:30.724 --> 01:26:32.285]  That's how you change the world.
[01:26:32.285 --> 01:26:33.885]  And that is so incredibly beautiful.
[01:26:33.885 --> 01:26:34.926]  Swimforswear.com.
[01:26:34.926 --> 01:26:36.546]  Okay, let's take a call right now.
[01:26:36.546 --> 01:26:37.427]  Who's up first, guys?
[01:26:37.427 --> 01:26:38.247]  Who are we saying go to first?
[01:26:44.764 --> 01:26:48.387]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Joanna in Texas.
[01:26:48.387 --> 01:26:51.890]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:26:51.890 --> 01:27:09.203]  Hi, so I just wanted to say the local news is saying that there are no cases of coronavirus in North Texas, but we went to Medical City Dallas yesterday and first thing we noticed is the quarantine area and then later my dad was speaking to a lady who later told him that
[01:27:09.642 --> 01:27:14.384]  Her daughter is there with the coronavirus, which, you know, he about had a heart attack when he heard that.
[01:27:14.384 --> 01:27:14.704]  Oh, yeah.
[01:27:14.704 --> 01:27:19.566]  Well, look, I mean, look, I don't like cover-ups because I think they always backfire.
[01:27:19.566 --> 01:27:21.387]  But there's a giant cover-up.
[01:27:21.387 --> 01:27:23.248]  They're not putting out the testing.
[01:27:23.248 --> 01:27:24.688]  They're covering up.
[01:27:24.688 --> 01:27:25.228]  Absolutely.
[01:27:25.228 --> 01:27:28.030]  Coronavirus is all over the place.
[01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.370]  Right.
[01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:36.293]  And we were later told- Well, we go back, so you're up in Dallas, at least at Medical City, and your dad's told, oh, yeah, that people are in there with coronavirus.
[01:27:37.529 --> 01:27:43.990]  Yeah, we were later told that they already have 20 people there with different strains of coronavirus.
[01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:46.831]  Was that a janitor saying that or was that a nurse your dad talked to?
[01:27:46.831 --> 01:27:49.531]  Was that an authoritative source?
[01:27:49.531 --> 01:27:53.752]  Well, they've been in the ICU for about three weeks already.
[01:27:53.752 --> 01:27:56.613]  Oh wow, so your dad's in the ICU and they're telling him that.
[01:27:56.613 --> 01:27:57.953]  Wow, that's authoritative.
[01:27:57.953 --> 01:27:58.633]  Yeah.
[01:27:58.633 --> 01:28:00.013]  What did they tell him specifically?
[01:28:00.013 --> 01:28:01.013]  Let me stop interrupting.
[01:28:01.013 --> 01:28:03.154]  Hold music, please.
[01:28:03.154 --> 01:28:04.114]  What did they tell your dad?
[01:28:06.221 --> 01:28:13.150]  I mean, he was basically told by a lady that, you know, her daughter is there sick with the coronavirus.
[01:28:13.150 --> 01:28:17.635]  And then I'm assuming she's the same one who told him they already have 20 people there.
[01:28:17.635 --> 01:28:21.921]  Well, let me tell you, five weeks ago I was told by a White House source that
[01:28:22.981 --> 01:28:28.566]  They already had FEMA in place, and Seattle's the epicenter, and they were already ready, and they had already broke containment.
[01:28:28.566 --> 01:28:30.387]  So all Trump would do is try to stop panic.
[01:28:30.387 --> 01:28:32.409]  And it was, what is he supposed to do?
[01:28:32.409 --> 01:28:33.590]  I mean, it's already out.
[01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:35.031]  We just don't need to panic.
[01:28:35.031 --> 01:28:36.332]  There's nothing you can do at this point.
[01:28:36.332 --> 01:28:37.093]  I'm sorry.
[01:28:37.093 --> 01:28:40.056]  We're just going to have to roll the dice and find out how bad it is.
[01:28:40.056 --> 01:28:41.397]  I think Trump's right, actually.
[01:28:41.857 --> 01:28:43.599]  A lot of people are criticizing Trump.
[01:28:43.599 --> 01:28:51.069]  I just think he needs to be honest about the fact that it probably is really bad, and that everybody's ready for what's coming instead of panicking and losing confidence in him.
[01:28:51.069 --> 01:28:52.051]  Joni, God bless you.
[01:28:52.051 --> 01:28:53.072]  I hope your dad gets better.
[01:28:53.072 --> 01:28:56.537]  All right, I'm coming right back, and I promise I'm going bam, bam, bam to your calls.
[01:28:57.839 --> 01:28:58.860]  Everybody's calling me.
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:06.205]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[01:29:06.205 --> 01:29:07.646]  How bad is it really?
[01:29:07.646 --> 01:29:10.329]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, storable foods.
[01:29:10.329 --> 01:29:13.291]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that actually still has food.
[01:29:13.291 --> 01:29:16.033]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[01:29:16.033 --> 01:29:16.653]  They got the food.
[01:29:16.653 --> 01:29:20.136]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing, and that's drink.
[01:29:20.236 --> 01:29:31.863]  Purified water, that's pray, that's get focused, that's not be stressed out because you're prepared, and that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest immune booster you can engage in.
[01:29:31.863 --> 01:29:34.244]  The X2, the X3, the foundation, everything.
[01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:35.905]  The Ultra 12, back in stock.
[01:29:35.905 --> 01:29:39.848]  Our Nano Silver, Super Silver, and Super Blue Toothpaste, it's still 50% off.
[01:29:39.848 --> 01:29:44.951]  Turmeric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells.
[01:29:44.951 --> 01:29:47.713]  We have the strongest turmeric you're gonna find out there.
[01:29:47.713 --> 01:29:49.974]  95% humanoid from bodies, open tumor forming, well that's backwards
[01:29:49.974 --> 01:29:50.435]  We're good to go.
[01:29:58.757 --> 01:30:01.378]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[01:30:01.378 --> 01:30:08.339]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[01:30:08.339 --> 01:30:19.221]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key co-factors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[01:30:19.221 --> 01:30:25.502]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[01:30:25.502 --> 01:30:26.483]  It is back in stock.
[01:30:26.483 --> 01:30:27.923]  You can get them both individually.
[01:30:28.463 --> 01:30:35.707]  For 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[01:30:35.707 --> 01:30:43.131]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[01:30:43.131 --> 01:30:51.195]  And of course, vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[01:30:51.195 --> 01:30:57.298]  And they're both back in stock 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:30:59.301 --> 01:31:00.083]  Real stuff, man.
[01:31:00.083 --> 01:31:01.246]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[01:31:01.246 --> 01:31:07.021]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him, everybody.
[01:31:08.072 --> 01:31:09.573]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[01:31:09.573 --> 01:31:11.294]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[01:31:11.294 --> 01:31:14.536]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[01:31:14.536 --> 01:31:18.939]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[01:31:18.939 --> 01:31:20.179]  20 different stickers.
[01:31:20.179 --> 01:31:21.800]  Impeach the Democrats.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:22.861]  Save the Second Amendment.
[01:31:22.861 --> 01:31:23.962]  Defend the First Amendment.
[01:31:23.962 --> 01:31:25.282]  Infowars.com.
[01:31:25.282 --> 01:31:27.464]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[01:31:27.464 --> 01:31:32.247]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[01:31:32.247 --> 01:31:33.808]  People say, why are you doing this?
[01:31:33.808 --> 01:31:34.348]  What's happening?
[01:31:34.348 --> 01:31:37.870]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored, and Trump won't do anything about it.
[01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:40.111]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers
[01:32:05.071 --> 01:32:07.199]  That without you, we won't be on the air.
[01:32:07.199 --> 01:32:08.664]  And I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:16.864]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[01:32:16.864 --> 01:32:24.347]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[01:32:24.347 --> 01:32:33.172]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[01:32:33.172 --> 01:32:37.714]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[01:32:38.632 --> 01:32:40.474]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:15.026 --> 01:33:19.469]  We got police and firefighters and military and everybody calling in.
[01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:22.451]  So I'm going to shut up now and go to your calls.
[01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:24.953]  Alex Jones here back live on this live Sunday show.
[01:33:24.953 --> 01:33:26.354]  Don't forget the weekday show is coming up tomorrow.
[01:33:26.354 --> 01:33:27.114]  11 a.m.
[01:33:27.114 --> 01:33:27.394]  Central.
[01:33:27.394 --> 01:33:28.855]  David Knight comes on before me.
[01:33:28.855 --> 01:33:29.576]  The David Knight Show.
[01:33:29.576 --> 01:33:30.176]  It's excellent.
[01:33:30.176 --> 01:33:31.037]  Very informative.
[01:33:31.037 --> 01:33:31.337]  8 a.m.
[01:33:31.337 --> 01:33:32.258]  Central.
[01:33:32.258 --> 01:33:33.098]  Infowars.com.
[01:33:33.098 --> 01:33:35.900]  Ford's last show and Bandai video.
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:36.961]  Craig in Washington.
[01:33:36.961 --> 01:33:37.621]  Thanks for calling.
[01:33:37.621 --> 01:33:38.062]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:33:39.626 --> 01:33:40.946]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:33:40.946 --> 01:33:42.347]  Happy Sunday.
[01:33:42.347 --> 01:33:52.348]  Hey, I want to go down the economic path with you on this one, because, I mean, that's the one thing we know is that this is going to really mess up the economy.
[01:33:52.348 --> 01:33:54.549]  Oh, 100% they're trying to derail the recovery.
[01:33:54.549 --> 01:33:56.529]  It's a trade war deal.
[01:33:56.529 --> 01:34:04.611]  100% supply chain's already cut off, which should be a good thing if we just belly up to it and become sufficient like Russia's done, because sanctions made Russia stronger in some ways.
[01:34:04.611 --> 01:34:05.411]  What do you think's going to happen?
[01:34:06.536 --> 01:34:08.921]  You know, I've got a saying right now is...
[01:34:10.143 --> 01:34:13.745]  The interest payments don't stop because of a virus.
[01:34:13.745 --> 01:34:15.266]  There's no vaccine for that.
[01:34:15.266 --> 01:34:22.111]  So when people aren't showing up at restaurants and people aren't going to work, interest is still going ahead.
[01:34:22.111 --> 01:34:27.575]  And as you know, this is the world record in the history of man for debt.
[01:34:27.575 --> 01:34:28.575]  No, you're right.
[01:34:28.575 --> 01:34:33.158]  A lot of people, a lot of smart folks are saying this is a globalist reset.
[01:34:33.158 --> 01:34:37.742]  So they save face on imploding the economy and then re-monetizing everything.
[01:34:37.742 --> 01:34:38.182]  What do you think?
[01:34:38.954 --> 01:34:39.955]  I think exactly that.
[01:34:39.955 --> 01:34:44.958]  I think that we are, as humanity, is not up for another war.
[01:34:44.958 --> 01:34:49.880]  So they did something that's a little more palatable, you know, a virus.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:50.501]  They're right.
[01:34:50.501 --> 01:34:52.562]  I was going to say that at the start of the show today and you just said it.
[01:34:52.562 --> 01:34:54.603]  It's why the calls are so great.
[01:34:54.603 --> 01:34:57.925]  Instead of having a big war like we normally have, they're just giving us this virus.
[01:34:57.925 --> 01:34:58.966]  What else do you think is coming, Craig?
[01:34:59.912 --> 01:35:08.641]  You know, so we've got the reset, which is going to cause fear, and fear is their, that's their club that they use to beat us down.
[01:35:08.641 --> 01:35:19.692]  And I'd like to give you Zeus' thunderbolt on the other side, because right now, and I've thought about this even before the virus, just that, so they're going to, they're going to hit us.
[01:35:19.692 --> 01:35:23.255]  Oh, I said two months ago, I bet when they don't get him impeached, they launch a bioweapon.
[01:35:23.255 --> 01:35:23.816]  I'm on record.
[01:35:24.136 --> 01:35:29.399]  Yeah, yeah, no, no, yeah, but I just mean in terms of this economic... No, no, no, you're right too.
[01:35:29.399 --> 01:35:31.000]  The callers are smarter than I am.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.763]  It's incredible how just the people know, the people understand that.
[01:35:34.763 --> 01:35:36.283]  The philosophers all knew that.
[01:35:36.283 --> 01:35:38.685]  When I say, oh, you're right, I'm just agreeing with you.
[01:35:39.369 --> 01:35:42.151]  Yeah, I mean this reset has to happen.
[01:35:42.151 --> 01:35:46.114]  Virus or no virus, this has just speeded it up and probably made it worse.
[01:35:46.114 --> 01:35:48.535]  It's 100% a cover for China losing the trade war.
[01:35:48.535 --> 01:35:49.736]  It's their reset.
[01:35:49.736 --> 01:35:54.679]  The globalists make behind-the-scenes deals that they then intend to blame on Trump.
[01:35:54.679 --> 01:35:56.100]  Do you agree with that?
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:57.401]  I totally agree with that.
[01:35:57.401 --> 01:35:58.582]  So how does Trump counter that?
[01:35:58.582 --> 01:35:59.623]  How does Trump counter that, Craig?
[01:36:00.512 --> 01:36:10.278]  So, when that happens, and people's pensions are getting whacked, and people are out of jobs in their fear, the one thing is, you haven't had Katherine Austin Fitz on for a long time.
[01:36:10.278 --> 01:36:11.259]  Please get her on this week.
[01:36:11.259 --> 01:36:13.620]  I'm telling the producers, get Fitz on immediately.
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:19.484]  Because, have you heard about the 21 trillion dollars that's been verified?
[01:36:19.484 --> 01:36:24.367]  So, she is working with a professor at Michigan State.
[01:36:24.367 --> 01:36:26.829]  They went through the books, and I think it's just the DOD.
[01:36:26.829 --> 01:36:28.790]  You're talking about the Pentagon missing money, yeah.
[01:36:29.557 --> 01:36:42.506]  Yeah, no, no, but she has taken a, Michigan State professor took a hold, the whole economic department went through this, just that one department, 21 trillion missing dollars.
[01:36:42.506 --> 01:36:44.387]  No, I know, it's been incredible.
[01:36:44.387 --> 01:36:45.548]  Thank you so much.
[01:36:45.548 --> 01:36:47.329]  So you talked to that caller for 10 hours.
[01:36:47.329 --> 01:36:48.030]  Thank you, Craig.
[01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:49.110]  Okay, who's up next?
[01:36:49.110 --> 01:36:51.312]  Wesley, Wesley in Georgia.
[01:36:51.312 --> 01:36:53.093]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:36:53.093 --> 01:36:54.554]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:36:54.554 --> 01:36:58.557]  Man, I've been racking my brain because I just gut level, I really feel concerned.
[01:36:59.229 --> 01:37:03.810]  Well, listen, Alex, I'm a firefighter in Georgia in the heart of a community of about 60,000.
[01:37:03.810 --> 01:37:05.891]  God bless you, brother.
[01:37:05.891 --> 01:37:07.791]  Thank you for your service to America.
[01:37:07.791 --> 01:37:08.772]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:37:08.772 --> 01:37:10.532]  And the other day, the chief comes to me.
[01:37:10.532 --> 01:37:11.913]  We've been friends for years.
[01:37:11.913 --> 01:37:15.153]  And he says, I just found out something.
[01:37:15.153 --> 01:37:22.696]  And here's the city's credit card and told me to order $2,000 worth of medical supplies.
[01:37:22.696 --> 01:37:24.736]  And him and I, we don't hold secrets.
[01:37:24.736 --> 01:37:26.877]  And he would not tell me what he found out, Alex.
[01:37:26.877 --> 01:37:27.837]  So something's going on.
[01:37:28.302 --> 01:37:30.524]  Well, that's because he was ordered to not tell you.
[01:37:30.524 --> 01:37:31.004]  That's right.
[01:37:31.004 --> 01:37:32.785]  The second point, Alex, I'll be real quick.
[01:37:32.785 --> 01:37:33.746]  I know you got to change.
[01:37:33.746 --> 01:37:35.387]  No, no, we want to hear from you.
[01:37:35.387 --> 01:37:43.072]  Let me tell you, where the rubber meets the road with firefighters and police officers and medics, that's where you really find out what's going on.
[01:37:43.072 --> 01:37:44.433]  So tell us what you know.
[01:37:44.433 --> 01:37:48.056]  Well, you know, Alex, you've been wanting to know, you know, who really started this.
[01:37:48.056 --> 01:37:53.039]  And I think to answer that question is you have to find out who stands to gain something.
[01:37:53.039 --> 01:37:53.460]  Exactly.
[01:37:54.065 --> 01:37:57.927]  So when the FEMA quarantine camps are going on, who stands to gain something?
[01:37:57.927 --> 01:38:01.409]  It's Amazon that delivers all the food with a drone.
[01:38:01.409 --> 01:38:02.129]  Okay?
[01:38:02.129 --> 01:38:04.830]  When Congress... Oh, just like China!
[01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:07.592]  Oh, you just... Oh my God, that's why I love the callers.
[01:38:07.592 --> 01:38:08.812]  I'm telling you, Alex.
[01:38:08.812 --> 01:38:11.794]  They were doing massive drone tests the last six months at night.
[01:38:11.794 --> 01:38:13.955]  Turned out it was Amazon doing it.
[01:38:13.955 --> 01:38:17.857]  Oh, they've been... Just like... Drones are controlling everything in China.
[01:38:17.857 --> 01:38:19.378]  Oh my gosh.
[01:38:19.378 --> 01:38:21.199]  It's going to get better, Alex.
[01:38:21.199 --> 01:38:21.699]  Start over!
[01:38:21.699 --> 01:38:22.439]  No, you've got the floor.
[01:38:22.439 --> 01:38:23.060]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:23.280]  Go ahead.
[01:38:23.902 --> 01:38:29.363]  So when Congress and the government is operating off a telecom, who stands to gain?
[01:38:29.363 --> 01:38:35.185]  Okay, now that's Facebook and Microsoft when everything's on the OneDrive cloud.
[01:38:35.185 --> 01:38:37.585]  Now you said it, the Pentagon's going over to their control.
[01:38:37.585 --> 01:38:40.406]  This is, and it's big tech ordering the panic.
[01:38:40.406 --> 01:38:42.046]  This is their takeover right now.
[01:38:42.046 --> 01:38:44.667]  So they already took our speech and they surveil us.
[01:38:44.667 --> 01:38:47.928]  Now they're teaching us, they tell us to stay in our houses, and now they watch us.
[01:38:48.895 --> 01:38:56.881]  And see, this is just all part of a series of plan because, you know, people... You know what a 12-gauge shotgun would do with, like, number six?
[01:38:56.881 --> 01:38:58.422]  Number six, you don't hurt buildings behind it.
[01:38:58.422 --> 01:39:02.345]  Don't use double-lock buck, folks, if she's, like, number six or seven.
[01:39:02.345 --> 01:39:05.488]  Those drones are going down.
[01:39:05.488 --> 01:39:08.510]  You're talking about some bird-hunting, boy.
[01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:16.376]  And people, you know, I don't know if you remember two years ago, the black guys that got kicked out of Starbucks, that was just a ruse, Alex.
[01:39:16.954 --> 01:39:18.655]  And so it's little subtle things.
[01:39:18.655 --> 01:39:19.595]  Oh, no, it came out.
[01:39:19.595 --> 01:39:23.897]  They did that before the owner that would ask every white person why they were a racist.
[01:39:23.897 --> 01:39:26.258]  It's just you're exactly man.
[01:39:26.258 --> 01:39:29.079]  You're what's coming next.
[01:39:29.079 --> 01:39:33.220]  Well, you know, I mean, there's there's all kinds of things out that you can think of.
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:36.301]  And it starts with little subtle things like this.
[01:39:36.301 --> 01:39:41.103]  And David Knight said it best, you know, hey, well, what are you doing trying to get on this airplane?
[01:39:41.103 --> 01:39:43.404]  You don't have a vaccination certificate.
[01:39:43.404 --> 01:39:45.725]  And so it's it's those little subtle things.
[01:39:46.365 --> 01:39:51.707]  That they try to make Americans accept, and just, you know, we say, okay, you know, whatever.
[01:39:51.707 --> 01:40:02.630]  And before long, it's just like China, and we're not- You're right, we're accepting the social- China brags that they've got the cell phones tracking where you go, what you do, and if you haven't done what they say, they turn it off during the emergency.
[01:40:02.630 --> 01:40:09.712]  This is a global government- Alex, now they've got at airports where you go, you scan your face instead of showing your passport, and Americans, they just line up.
[01:40:09.712 --> 01:40:11.553]  They actually pay for the service.
[01:40:15.137 --> 01:40:18.180]  And the kids are all trained on their iPhones to get on the phone via that.
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:19.522]  No, it's all training.
[01:40:19.522 --> 01:40:20.363]  It's all synthetic.
[01:40:20.363 --> 01:40:23.627]  Wesley, get Wesley's name and number because we're starting that show soon.
[01:40:23.627 --> 01:40:24.608]  It's going to happen.
[01:40:24.608 --> 01:40:25.729]  We're the callers of the host.
[01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:26.470]  Get his name and number.
[01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:27.251]  Put it in the hopper.
[01:40:27.251 --> 01:40:29.573]  Please, guys, don't forget.
[01:40:29.573 --> 01:40:31.796]  Wow.
[01:40:31.796 --> 01:40:36.181]  Yeah, how facial recognition is taking over airports, but we got to let the jihadis in.
[01:40:36.181 --> 01:40:36.321]  Wow.
[01:40:37.984 --> 01:40:39.665]  All right, Wesley, thank you.
[01:40:39.665 --> 01:40:41.767]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:40:41.767 --> 01:40:44.008]  Lisa in California.
[01:40:44.008 --> 01:40:45.609]  Lisa, that was a scary caller.
[01:40:45.609 --> 01:40:46.250]  He was dead on.
[01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:47.530]  What do you have to say?
[01:40:47.530 --> 01:40:48.671]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:48.671 --> 01:40:53.935]  OK, so I totally I mean, the hype is crazy.
[01:40:53.935 --> 01:40:56.256]  It's everywhere.
[01:40:56.256 --> 01:41:05.623]  But, you know, you have been promoting like preparedness and get your store, you know, storable foods.
[01:41:05.623 --> 01:41:06.183]  And that's great.
[01:41:06.792 --> 01:41:15.299]  That you have not been, you haven't been promoting your supplements.
[01:41:15.299 --> 01:41:20.423]  And I think I have just about everything except for Turbo, of course, for our family.
[01:41:20.423 --> 01:41:21.964]  And it works.
[01:41:21.964 --> 01:41:24.026]  You have to build your immune system.
[01:41:26.007 --> 01:41:29.249]  You're going to end up in the hospital and what good is your food going to do you?
[01:41:46.381 --> 01:41:49.942]  Jacking yourself up overall is probably not good, but people use it, I use it.
[01:41:49.942 --> 01:41:52.863]  It's not bad for you, I'm just being honest, it's not to boost your immunity.
[01:41:52.863 --> 01:41:59.925]  But absolutely, the fish oil, the D3, the Ultra 12, it's all back in stock.
[01:41:59.925 --> 01:42:04.487]  You're absolutely right, it's what funds the operation and they are great products.
[01:42:04.487 --> 01:42:15.170]  Right, and you know, I just want to say, you should have Shiva Iyer-Duray on your program because he talks about building the system, your immune system.
[01:42:15.774 --> 01:42:21.761]  Because you need to build that, and every single one of your products will build your immune system.
[01:42:21.761 --> 01:42:24.945]  And then working together all, you know, in synergy.
[01:42:24.945 --> 01:42:26.547]  I'm out of time, Lisa, but God bless you.
[01:42:26.547 --> 01:42:32.314]  Let me just say this, because Mike Adams told me two weeks ago, he goes, hey, you keep saying food is six to eight weeks now.
[01:42:34.102 --> 01:42:36.284]  People think that's your supplements.
[01:42:36.284 --> 01:42:38.305]  I drop ship the food.
[01:42:38.305 --> 01:42:39.306]  Nobody else has the food.
[01:42:39.306 --> 01:42:40.047]  We have the best company.
[01:42:40.047 --> 01:42:40.627]  You actually get it.
[01:42:40.627 --> 01:42:41.628]  We're not going to lie.
[01:42:41.628 --> 01:42:42.309]  6 to 8 weeks.
[01:42:42.309 --> 01:42:46.192]  More like 4 to 5 weeks to 6 to 8.
[01:42:46.192 --> 01:42:47.392]  We have the technology.
[01:42:47.392 --> 01:42:48.834]  We have the supplements.
[01:42:48.834 --> 01:42:52.336]  You order them, unless it's on a Friday, they ship the next day.
[01:42:52.336 --> 01:42:54.638]  Our warehouse is next day shipping.
[01:42:58.004 --> 01:42:59.930]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[01:42:59.930 --> 01:43:04.886]  Coronavirus is a man-made bioweapon designed to destroy nation-states...
[01:43:08.308 --> 01:43:09.849]  Planetary government.
[01:43:09.849 --> 01:43:12.271]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[01:43:12.271 --> 01:43:14.353]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[01:43:14.353 --> 01:43:21.238]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3,000 cruise ship passengers return home.
[01:43:21.238 --> 01:43:23.760]  And that's just in one nation.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.564]  Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China.
[01:43:28.564 --> 01:43:32.728]  They're reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[01:43:33.528 --> 01:43:36.709]  That's how major this is.
[01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:38.450]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:42.151]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[01:43:42.151 --> 01:43:51.394]  InfoWars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out, regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[01:43:51.394 --> 01:43:57.036]  We need you to step up to the plate and help spread the word about Bandog Video and InfoWars.com today.
[01:43:58.076 --> 01:44:06.779]  I always promote DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the cells and empowers the telomeres and the mitochondria.
[01:44:06.779 --> 01:44:12.520]  It's the most powerful formula out there sold over the counter that is known to energize the body.
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:16.102]  I'm not going to jack up prices during crisis, but I am going to end up running out.
[01:44:16.102 --> 01:44:23.864]  So fund the InfoWarp, boost your immune system, and get things like X2 and X3, the absolute building block of the whole body, clean iodine, atomic,
[01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:25.005]  Powerful.
[01:44:25.005 --> 01:44:27.046]  Total booster in your whole life.
[01:44:27.046 --> 01:44:29.908]  Not just for immunity, but for libido, stamina, you name it.
[01:44:29.908 --> 01:44:33.070]  And you need to boost your immunity at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:40.256]  With bodies, with DNA Force+, with phytonaminal fusion, with Ultra 12 that's back in stock, and Turbo Force, by the way, just came back into stock.
[01:44:40.256 --> 01:44:41.456]  It just boosts everything.
[01:44:41.456 --> 01:44:42.717]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:44:42.717 --> 01:44:43.758]  You fund the InfoWare.
[01:44:43.758 --> 01:44:45.339]  You fund the rebellion against the globalists.
[01:44:45.339 --> 01:44:47.961]  You get great prices and you boost your immune system.
[01:44:47.961 --> 01:44:49.042]  A total 360 win.
[01:44:49.042 --> 01:44:49.642]  Take action.
[01:44:49.642 --> 01:44:50.503]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:44:50.643 --> 01:44:51.344]  We're good to go.
[01:45:09.747 --> 01:45:17.033]  A handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at InfoWars.
[01:45:17.033 --> 01:45:20.396]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:20.396 --> 01:45:24.299]  So right now, humanity is awakening, it's explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:34.427]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game, like MFWC, is your financial support.
[01:45:34.427 --> 01:45:37.310]  We make it really easy at MFWCstore.com.
[01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:40.072]  But I am blowing through our backup money.
[01:45:42.765 --> 01:45:43.346]  I think so.
[01:45:57.958 --> 01:45:58.759]  Everybody needs food.
[01:45:58.759 --> 01:46:00.320]  I'm proud we're selling high quality food.
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:03.102]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble.
[01:46:03.102 --> 01:46:05.564]  This is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[01:46:05.564 --> 01:46:10.128]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food.
[01:46:10.128 --> 01:46:12.870]  And I had long discussions this morning, over an hour long
[01:46:12.930 --> 01:46:13.490]  We're good to go.
[01:46:42.842 --> 01:46:44.604]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:14.881 --> 01:47:16.462]  Welcome back.
[01:47:16.462 --> 01:47:18.783]  It's the Alex Jones Show, Sunday evening live.
[01:47:18.783 --> 01:47:25.045]  We got a bunch of callers to finish up with Brandon and Jim and Rob and Ron and Matt and Paul and Taylor.
[01:47:25.045 --> 01:47:26.206]  So let's go quick.
[01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:27.566]  Brandon in Idaho, you're on the air.
[01:47:27.566 --> 01:47:28.166]  Thanks for holding.
[01:47:28.166 --> 01:47:29.887]  Welcome.
[01:47:29.887 --> 01:47:32.308]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:47:32.308 --> 01:47:33.329]  This is the big attack.
[01:47:33.329 --> 01:47:34.689]  This is the globalist attack.
[01:47:34.689 --> 01:47:37.010]  This is how 21st century warfare works.
[01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:39.731]  Chi-Com, globalist, deep state connected.
[01:47:39.731 --> 01:47:40.672]  It's totally clear now.
[01:47:40.672 --> 01:47:41.352]  So what do we do?
[01:47:42.538 --> 01:47:48.522]  Um, well, I don't have the answer to that, but I do have a theory on what, so Trump is the main focal point on this.
[01:47:48.522 --> 01:47:53.885]  He's the American people, he stands for the American people, America, and everything we represent.
[01:47:53.885 --> 01:47:57.447]  My fear is, with the election, just what, 200, 300 days away or something like that?
[01:47:57.447 --> 01:48:00.309]  Yeah, they're going to use this to cancel the election.
[01:48:00.309 --> 01:48:03.211]  Cancel the election, but this is how they get rid of Trump.
[01:48:03.211 --> 01:48:09.735]  Now, either this, I think I saw an article on you or Drudge or one of the two about the possibility of coronavirus already being in the White House.
[01:48:10.836 --> 01:48:12.719]  Coronavirus kills Trump.
[01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:13.941]  Oh, oh, funny!
[01:48:13.941 --> 01:48:18.308]  During the break I was about to come out and say this, but I didn't want to take time from you.
[01:48:18.308 --> 01:48:19.950]  Dr. McAmshaw, please.
[01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:24.998]  I said I'm not going to cover this when they gave it to me because I don't want to cut into caller's time, but you brought it up.
[01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:25.839]  This is what's incredible.
[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:29.162]  Because you didn't say this in your call screening.
[01:48:29.162 --> 01:48:35.926]  Matt Schlapp, the big neocon, who shook Trump's hand, interacted with CPAC attendee with coronavirus.
[01:48:35.926 --> 01:48:40.389]  Did they use that as the excuse to take out Trump or shut down the White House?
[01:48:40.389 --> 01:48:44.551]  They're in a CPAC chairman infected attendee with no contact with Trump.
[01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:44.912]  There you go.
[01:48:44.912 --> 01:48:45.332]  What do you think?
[01:48:46.311 --> 01:48:47.411]  Same thing.
[01:48:47.411 --> 01:48:48.872]  Quarantine in the White House.
[01:48:48.872 --> 01:48:49.652]  He's locked down.
[01:48:49.652 --> 01:48:51.453]  We know who he's throwing himself.
[01:48:51.453 --> 01:48:53.794]  But sir, do you know the synchronicity and serendipity?
[01:48:53.794 --> 01:48:55.274]  You've been on hold over an hour.
[01:48:55.274 --> 01:48:56.855]  You didn't call in about that.
[01:48:56.855 --> 01:48:59.596]  You just brought that up and that was the next article I was going to cover.
[01:48:59.596 --> 01:49:00.836]  That's crazy.
[01:49:00.836 --> 01:49:05.438]  That's because the rest of the people, the rest of the callers were making really good points and it kind of brought me into that.
[01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:05.778]  No, no, no.
[01:49:05.778 --> 01:49:10.360]  I'm just saying it's crazy that I almost went to that, but I didn't because I didn't want to cut you off.
[01:49:12.031 --> 01:49:14.352]  Well, things work in mysterious ways, right?
[01:49:14.352 --> 01:49:15.233]  God works in mysterious ways.
[01:49:15.233 --> 01:49:16.413]  That's the way it works, brother.
[01:49:16.413 --> 01:49:16.953]  Exactly.
[01:49:16.953 --> 01:49:25.377]  The enemy keeps thinking, I thought that as I was going live, I thought, as my father always says, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:49:25.377 --> 01:49:27.819]  These people always have plans that don't go the way they want.
[01:49:27.819 --> 01:49:32.581]  I was just like, oh my, we're totally, we're zeitgeist now, bro.
[01:49:32.581 --> 01:49:34.262]  Brandon, we're zeitgeisting, right?
[01:49:34.262 --> 01:49:38.804]  We're like, we're saying the same things without even like, this is crazy.
[01:49:39.525 --> 01:49:39.965]  I love it.
[01:49:39.965 --> 01:49:40.325]  I love it.
[01:49:40.325 --> 01:49:42.446]  And we don't know who he's surrounding himself with.
[01:49:42.446 --> 01:49:45.987]  Like I said, neocons, there's Democrats all over the place, you know, deep state.
[01:49:45.987 --> 01:49:50.708]  Seriously, he could either die from the virus, if not, he's quarantined in the White House, and they just take him out.
[01:49:50.708 --> 01:49:53.349]  Who are they to say, hey, he's after the coronavirus?
[01:49:53.349 --> 01:49:55.189]  Exactly, because they create such hysteria.
[01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.850]  Thank you, Brandon.
[01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:56.490]  Great points.
[01:49:56.490 --> 01:49:57.730]  Wow.
[01:49:57.730 --> 01:49:59.271]  Let's go to Jim in Texas.
[01:49:59.271 --> 01:50:00.111]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:50:00.111 --> 01:50:00.431]  Thank you, sir.
[01:50:01.311 --> 01:50:03.753]  God bless you, Alex, and all of the crew.
[01:50:03.753 --> 01:50:04.594]  Talk to Savannah.
[01:50:04.594 --> 01:50:07.596]  That was really an honor to do that.
[01:50:07.596 --> 01:50:09.017]  Isn't she amazing?
[01:50:09.017 --> 01:50:12.159]  Motivational things in life.
[01:50:12.159 --> 01:50:14.041]  Love and fear.
[01:50:14.041 --> 01:50:17.904]  Now, the globalists are trying to capitalize on fear.
[01:50:17.904 --> 01:50:22.407]  And in my family, we are not going to allow that to happen.
[01:50:22.407 --> 01:50:29.593]  We can battle against it as we continue to move ahead and think that, oh, this is a strain of a virus.
[01:50:30.083 --> 01:50:32.385]  Obviously it's a file weapon.
[01:50:32.385 --> 01:50:37.228]  So this is all they got against us is God is bigger than us.
[01:50:37.228 --> 01:50:39.889]  And Moses could drink poison.
[01:50:39.889 --> 01:50:41.290]  I agree mentally.
[01:50:41.290 --> 01:50:44.372]  You can overpower this stuff with God's power.
[01:50:44.372 --> 01:50:47.194]  And look at the timing of this Alex.
[01:50:47.194 --> 01:50:56.860]  Look at the timing of this happening when the Trump rallies continue to build and build and people are supporting our president and our cabinet and our government.
[01:50:57.338 --> 01:50:59.079]  And there's great people getting in our country.
[01:50:59.079 --> 01:51:00.780]  America's coming back.
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:03.041]  We won the trade war, and then here it comes.
[01:51:03.041 --> 01:51:06.263]  Right out of our main enemy comes this weapon.
[01:51:06.263 --> 01:51:11.346]  Then we have to just depend on God, because it's something that we can't control.
[01:51:11.346 --> 01:51:12.867]  But we need to keep moving forward.
[01:51:12.867 --> 01:51:18.830]  You know, stopping South by Southwest, as far as I'm concerned, was a mistake.
[01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:19.471]  No, I agree.
[01:51:19.471 --> 01:51:21.512]  No, it's Big Tech ordered it.
[01:51:21.512 --> 01:51:23.893]  Big Tech's on record ordering it.
[01:51:23.893 --> 01:51:24.834]  They wanted the fear.
[01:51:26.141 --> 01:51:33.307]  They want the fear to build, so we as InfoWarriors, and I've been one since 2005, God bless you, didn't see us.
[01:51:33.307 --> 01:51:37.631]  No, they're the big tech that built the web to get us connected, to control us.
[01:51:37.631 --> 01:51:39.353]  They want to run our, they're the evil.
[01:51:39.353 --> 01:51:42.395]  That's why Google says don't be evil, because it's pure evil.
[01:51:42.395 --> 01:51:47.039]  As we stay together, and that's the positive message about it.
[01:51:47.039 --> 01:51:49.882]  Love can absolutely beat and defeat fear.
[01:51:50.498 --> 01:51:51.559]  I love you, brother.
[01:51:51.559 --> 01:51:52.220]  Thank you, Jim.
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:52.781]  Great points.
[01:51:52.781 --> 01:51:54.403]  I'm trying to cram everybody in.
[01:51:54.403 --> 01:51:55.685]  Matt in Alberta, Canada.
[01:51:55.685 --> 01:51:57.067]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:51:57.067 --> 01:51:58.869]  Go ahead.
[01:51:58.869 --> 01:52:00.591]  Hey there, Alex.
[01:52:00.591 --> 01:52:01.352]  Good to see you.
[01:52:01.352 --> 01:52:03.355]  Good to talk to you.
[01:52:03.355 --> 01:52:04.236]  Where should we start?
[01:52:05.239 --> 01:52:12.324]  You know, I just want to, I just want to say, you know, like Trump has done so much good stuff for us up here, not only for you guys down there.
[01:52:12.324 --> 01:52:16.127]  Oh, he's pulling the troops out of Syria, out of Afghanistan.
[01:52:16.127 --> 01:52:17.188]  He's amazing.
[01:52:17.188 --> 01:52:19.049]  I feel bad even criticizing him.
[01:52:19.049 --> 01:52:25.434]  The Keystone XL pipeline, you know, it was put on hold by, you know, other people forever.
[01:52:25.434 --> 01:52:27.456]  By Soros, the dickhead.
[01:52:27.456 --> 01:52:28.336]  Yeah.
[01:52:28.336 --> 01:52:29.918]  And then he got it approved for us.
[01:52:29.918 --> 01:52:30.258]  And, you know,
[01:52:30.888 --> 01:52:32.289]  Canada is trying to separate.
[01:52:32.289 --> 01:52:35.732]  The Western Canada is trying to separate for some reason.
[01:52:35.732 --> 01:52:42.658]  And again, Soros and Buffett wanted to ship it all by train to your west coast of China.
[01:52:42.658 --> 01:52:43.739]  That's on record.
[01:52:43.739 --> 01:52:46.961]  And Trump just said, no, we're going to buy the Canadian oil and go to hell.
[01:52:46.961 --> 01:52:48.943]  If the Canadians want to sell it to us, we'll take it.
[01:52:48.943 --> 01:52:52.746]  The globalists wanted to say, you don't buy oil from Canadians.
[01:52:52.746 --> 01:52:56.670]  At 30% more than the Chinese were buying.
[01:52:56.670 --> 01:52:56.970]  Yeah.
[01:52:58.118 --> 01:53:02.425]  And, you know, another thing, too, that I wanted to touch on is Roger Stone.
[01:53:02.425 --> 01:53:03.687]  How is he doing?
[01:53:03.687 --> 01:53:05.611]  How's Roger Stone doing?
[01:53:05.611 --> 01:53:11.100]  Roger's on fire right now, and he feels really good, and that's all I can say.
[01:53:11.528 --> 01:53:16.090]  I think that's totally just uncalled for, you know, and I just, I really hope for the best.
[01:53:16.090 --> 01:53:19.812]  No, no, but he knows it's a fraud, and he sees the public supporting him, so that's all he cares about.
[01:53:19.812 --> 01:53:20.373]  Pat, thank you.
[01:53:20.373 --> 01:53:21.033]  Gotta jump again.
[01:53:21.033 --> 01:53:22.294]  Amazing call.
[01:53:22.294 --> 01:53:31.058]  Ron, in Arkansas, who MSNBC believes is the South, all the South is in Arkansas, and supposedly you're the worst people ever.
[01:53:31.058 --> 01:53:32.339]  I love folks in Arkansas.
[01:53:32.339 --> 01:53:39.643]  By the way, most of them are Democrats, so maybe I don't, but the Democrats don't even know it's their own state, and on MSNBC they say it's horrible and evil.
[01:53:40.603 --> 01:53:43.144]  Ron, go ahead from Arkansas.
[01:53:43.144 --> 01:53:45.904]  Yes, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:53:45.904 --> 01:53:50.245]  I just wanted to say a couple of points.
[01:53:50.245 --> 01:54:05.069]  During this Russian occlusion hoax back a while back on MSNBC, I saw I was surfing through my channels and stopped there and saw Hillary on there.
[01:54:05.069 --> 01:54:08.450]  And out of her own mouth, she said, what if I told you that
[01:54:10.531 --> 01:54:19.574]  An ex-State Department person would ask China to help us, seeing that Russia is helping Trump.
[01:54:19.574 --> 01:54:21.814]  You know, I saw that two months ago.
[01:54:21.814 --> 01:54:23.775]  Oh, oh wow.
[01:54:23.775 --> 01:54:24.595]  Tomorrow, guys.
[01:54:24.595 --> 01:54:26.056]  First thing on the show.
[01:54:26.056 --> 01:54:26.916]  Don't forget, crew.
[01:54:26.916 --> 01:54:27.356]  Please.
[01:54:27.356 --> 01:54:29.097]  Right on the wall.
[01:54:29.097 --> 01:54:31.297]  I remember she said, what if I ask China for help?
[01:54:31.297 --> 01:54:32.638]  And I think that's what they're doing right now.
[01:54:32.638 --> 01:54:34.458]  What do you think?
[01:54:34.458 --> 01:54:35.959]  I think it's just dead on.
[01:54:37.703 --> 01:54:53.451]  And another second point I would like to make about the coronavirus is, with all the fear tactics, is the vaccine is being produced by a company that's owned by Bill Gates.
[01:54:53.451 --> 01:54:53.692]  Yes.
[01:54:53.692 --> 01:54:56.333]  And he has the patent on it.
[01:54:56.333 --> 01:55:01.215]  And they have an RNA version and a DNA version.
[01:55:01.215 --> 01:55:01.876]  That's right.
[01:55:01.876 --> 01:55:04.637]  And the DNA version is supposed to change your DNA.
[01:55:04.637 --> 01:55:04.857]  Yep.
[01:55:06.744 --> 01:55:14.491]  When the earth got flooded by the father... That's because the fallen angels were changing the DNA of humans.
[01:55:14.491 --> 01:55:15.011]  That's right.
[01:55:15.011 --> 01:55:20.096]  I think this is what, you know... Oh yeah, the Bible says you want to get blown up, this is what you do.
[01:55:21.434 --> 01:55:26.058]  Yeah, and it ties into the Mark of the Beast also.
[01:55:26.058 --> 01:55:26.739]  No, I agree.
[01:55:26.739 --> 01:55:33.125]  It is literally, if you read the Bible, an alien takeover of us and God won't allow us to be joined because we're so powerful.
[01:55:33.125 --> 01:55:35.367]  It's just like, no, you're not doing that.
[01:55:35.367 --> 01:55:36.007]  I love you, brother.
[01:55:36.007 --> 01:55:36.948]  Call me back tomorrow, Ron.
[01:55:36.948 --> 01:55:37.669]  We've got to move fast.
[01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:38.950]  We've got two minutes left.
[01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:40.512]  I've got two callers left.
[01:55:40.512 --> 01:55:41.112]  Real fast.
[01:55:41.112 --> 01:55:42.433]  Paul in Tennessee and then Taylor.
[01:55:42.433 --> 01:55:42.994]  Paul, go ahead.
[01:55:42.994 --> 01:55:45.116]  Real fast.
[01:55:45.116 --> 01:55:45.776]  You there?
[01:55:45.776 --> 01:55:46.057]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:47.173 --> 01:55:51.276]  Alex, I just wanted to say, do you actually know who created the coronavirus?
[01:55:51.276 --> 01:55:53.477]  You've got more insider information than I do.
[01:55:53.477 --> 01:55:58.541]  Yeah, the University of North Carolina did it, and they sold it to the Chinese five years ago.
[01:55:58.541 --> 01:55:59.121]  Okay, brother.
[01:55:59.121 --> 01:56:01.543]  Alright, well, the thing, we only have one minute left, right?
[01:56:02.878 --> 01:56:03.218]  Go ahead.
[01:56:03.218 --> 01:56:03.478]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:03.478 --> 01:56:03.899]  I'm sorry.
[01:56:03.899 --> 01:56:04.399]  Go ahead.
[01:56:04.399 --> 01:56:08.201]  I just want to put a shout out to 1470 AM East Tennessee.
[01:56:08.201 --> 01:56:09.782]  Harry Grothjohn.
[01:56:09.782 --> 01:56:11.303]  He's one of your affiliates.
[01:56:11.303 --> 01:56:13.445]  I listened to you for 15 years.
[01:56:13.445 --> 01:56:15.406]  He's doing a fantastic job in East Tennessee.
[01:56:15.406 --> 01:56:17.667]  I wish you'd come and see us here sometime if you get a chance.
[01:56:17.667 --> 01:56:20.409]  Brother, I promise you, the next place I come will be there.
[01:56:20.409 --> 01:56:22.010]  And I love Grothjohn.
[01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:23.691]  Thank you so much.
[01:56:23.691 --> 01:56:26.593]  You think... We gotta go.
[01:56:26.593 --> 01:56:27.133]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:56:27.133 --> 01:56:28.594]  Thanks for holding.
[01:56:28.594 --> 01:56:29.455]  Taylor in Texas.
[01:56:29.455 --> 01:56:29.955]  Last caller.
[01:56:29.955 --> 01:56:30.896]  You'll be our tail gunner.
[01:56:30.896 --> 01:56:31.176]  Go ahead.
[01:56:32.974 --> 01:56:34.614]  Yes, I love your show.
[01:56:34.614 --> 01:56:37.955]  I just want to say thank you for turning me on to anti-vaccination.
[01:56:37.955 --> 01:56:39.575]  It saved my son.
[01:56:39.575 --> 01:56:42.796]  You know, we didn't vaccinate him, so I just want to thank you on that.
[01:56:42.796 --> 01:56:57.299]  I do believe the coronavirus does have something to do with 5G, and I do believe it was released, and you've done an excellent job with your crew, and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
[01:56:57.299 --> 01:56:59.460]  Oh, the crew has done a great job.
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:00.220]  They are amazing.
[01:57:01.107 --> 01:57:07.993]  It's not about patronizing them, but they literally are the guts and the blood and the eyeballs, the whole operation.
[01:57:07.993 --> 01:57:18.541]  And I just want to leave it on, uh, 2 Corinthians, there's three, uh, through, uh, three through four, uh, 2 Corinthians three through four.
[01:57:18.541 --> 01:57:20.042]  And, uh, that's been my stronghold.
[01:57:20.042 --> 01:57:23.105]  And also, uh, I'm a victor, not a, not a victim.
[01:57:23.105 --> 01:57:25.707]  And I've been using that from here on out.
[01:57:25.707 --> 01:57:26.848]  No, you're right, brother.
[01:57:26.848 --> 01:57:29.310]  We cannot get into a victim psychology.
[01:57:31.724 --> 01:57:34.767]  Your dad, not a victim.
[01:57:34.767 --> 01:57:36.889]  He's dead enough.
[01:57:36.889 --> 01:57:40.653]  But it's that moment when you smash that tyrant.
[01:57:40.653 --> 01:57:43.315]  You see them fall, you know it's God, not you.
[01:57:43.315 --> 01:57:45.738]  But the hammer, the hammer never forgets.
[01:57:47.788 --> 01:57:48.829]  Everybody's calling me.
[01:57:48.829 --> 01:57:56.155]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[01:57:56.155 --> 01:57:57.596]  How bad is it really?
[01:57:57.596 --> 01:58:00.298]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality storable foods.
[01:58:00.298 --> 01:58:03.261]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation, that actually still has food.
[01:58:03.261 --> 01:58:05.983]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[01:58:05.983 --> 01:58:06.604]  They got the food.
[01:58:06.604 --> 01:58:09.306]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing.
[01:58:09.566 --> 01:58:29.094]  And that's drink purified water, that's pray, that's get focused, that's not be stressed out because you're prepared, and that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest immune booster you can engage in, the X2, the X3, the foundation, everything, the Ultra 12 back in stock, our Nano Silver, Super Silver, and Super Blue toothpaste, it's still 50% off.
[01:58:29.994 --> 01:58:34.895]  Tumeric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells.
[01:58:34.895 --> 01:58:37.656]  We have the strongest tumeric you're going to find out there.
[01:58:37.656 --> 01:58:39.457]  95% humanoid from bodies, ultimate tumeric formula.

[01:58:51.614 --> 01:58:53.256]  Owl Killer in New Jersey.
[01:58:53.256 --> 01:58:53.836]  You're on the air.
[01:58:53.836 --> 01:58:54.416]  Go ahead.
[01:58:54.416 --> 01:58:57.179]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[01:58:57.179 --> 01:59:00.261]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[01:59:00.261 --> 01:59:05.545]  So that's Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste and that Super Blue Whitening Toothpaste is on another level.
[01:59:05.545 --> 01:59:10.710]  I use the one I use the Super Blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[01:59:10.710 --> 01:59:13.532]  It is by far the best product that I've ever used in my life.
[01:59:13.532 --> 01:59:16.174]  I literally just took turbo course on my way to the gym right now.
[01:59:16.354 --> 01:59:24.460]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:25.801]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[01:59:25.801 --> 01:59:26.722]  Support this man.
[01:59:26.722 --> 01:59:28.223]  Everything that he exposed.
[01:59:28.223 --> 01:59:29.644]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[01:59:29.644 --> 01:59:30.765]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[01:59:30.765 --> 01:59:32.046]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[01:59:32.046 --> 01:59:34.908]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[01:59:34.908 --> 01:59:36.569]  Go look it up yourself.
[01:59:36.569 --> 01:59:37.710]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[01:59:37.710 --> 01:59:38.931]  They definitely want us off the air.
[01:59:38.931 --> 01:59:39.852]  Without you, we're not here.
[01:59:39.852 --> 01:59:41.753]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[01:59:51.337 --> 01:59:53.946]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
