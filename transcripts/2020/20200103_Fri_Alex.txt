[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:05.472]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:20.500]  The InfoWars servers are laboring right now under record traffic as the world tunes in to hear
[00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:36.736]  But myself and my guests are going to break down and say and what callers to this broadcast are going to say about the historic, incredibly bold move that we witnessed yesterday by the president.
[00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:41.318]  I came up here last night, shot a special report at 10 p.m.
[00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.001]  right as the president was taking credit for what unfolded.
[00:00:49.107 --> 00:00:58.551]  We have the top link at DrudgeReport.com and you can see it there and we have live feeds embedded in that report.
[00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:12.137]  Sleeper cells in the USA and the report details how the FBI has already arrested people that were clearly planning sleeper cell attacks.
[00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:17.940]  We're going to be looking at every angle of that as well.
[00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:29.577]  I'm asking listeners to really pull back and be cerebral about this, and I'm trying to do that myself.
[00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:32.177]  I'm certainly not lecturing you, I'm lecturing myself.
[00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:51.304]  And look geopolitically what's happening around the world and what message President Trump is really sending with this, not just to North Korea, but also to Obama and Hillary and John Kerry that have been working with Iran publicly against President Trump and Congress and against the law.
[00:01:52.762 --> 00:02:06.292]  And the fact that they've been encouraging Iran to attack ships, sink ships, and engage in massive paramilitary activity across the Middle East, triggering a wider civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.
[00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:09.515]  So that's really what's going on here.
[00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:13.318]  Now, is it good what President Trump did?
[00:02:13.338 --> 00:02:15.079]  Well, let's look at why he did do it.
[00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:36.364]  And then let's ask ourselves what he was supposed to do if he didn't take action and Iran was given a green light to continue to expand provocations and try to overthrow the Iraqi government and install another domino in their plan for the original Islamic Republic of Planet Earth.
[00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:44.569]  ISIS was simply trying to copy from a Sunni perspective what the Shiites have successfully done in Persia.
[00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:49.433]  And the Iranians are where the word Aryan comes from.
[00:02:49.453 --> 00:02:57.356]  Hitler modeled his system off of the Aryan plan, where they have believed for 3,000 years they have a right to rule the Earth.
[00:02:58.297 --> 00:03:13.824]  The Iranian people are very smart folks, and they founded what is modern India today, Pakistan, they invented chess, much of language, astronomy, and a mixture of that with expansionist Islam is a good case of cancer.
[00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:16.899]  Anyway you slice it.
[00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.222]  So we already had one guy last century saying he was an Aryan going to take over the planet.
[00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:24.665]  And we do have that going on again.
[00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:26.587]  I'm not saying I want to have war with Iran.
[00:03:26.987 --> 00:03:28.268]  I'm not saying they're the devil.
[00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:42.259]  I'm saying that the Hezbollah militias all over the world are the most expansionist arm of Islam and are working with the globalist deep state
[00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:48.568]  against President Trump and America, and so that's not being discussed in the news why this happened.
[00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.269]  Israel is bracing for retaliatory strikes as well.
[00:03:52.289 --> 00:04:04.753]  The Pentagon has said that it will be a massive counter-strikes if Iran responds disproportionately, because this was a response to the attack on the embassy, and I want to be crystal clear yet again.
[00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:07.994]  This is not a false flag.
[00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.114]  This is not a staged event.
[00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.909]  We were attacked.
[00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:12.270]  Our sovereign territory was.
[00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.611]  Our troops have been getting killed all over the Middle East and Africa by Shiite-trained groups.
[00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:20.093]  And so this is a very strong message from the President.
[00:04:20.773 --> 00:04:22.154]  Will the gamble succeed?
[00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:28.676]  We'll look at the pros and cons, where I think it's all going, and where you think it's going today, on this Friday.
[00:04:31.457 --> 00:04:35.499]  This is the potential for World War III.
[00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:46.958]  And with asymmetric warfare being carried out in Western nations by the Quds forces and their allied militias of Hezbollah.
[00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.601]  Again, I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:51.063]  We are now into 2020.
[00:04:53.172 --> 00:05:07.237]  It is the third day of January 2020, and we are going to open the phones up throughout the next four hours, starting at the bottom of the hour, and we'll give out the toll-free number at the start of the next segment.
[00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:20.741]  Now, I am not going to come on this show and choose a side of I'm for this strike or I'm against this strike.
[00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:25.860]  And I'm not doing that to be lukewarm and to not take a side.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:43.632]  I'm doing that because I want to look at this from the perspectives of the Iranian government and the individuals running our government and talk about the different players that are involved and what has brought us to this point.
[00:05:44.732 --> 00:05:49.776]  Then, at the bottom of the hour, I am going to give you my personal view
[00:05:51.755 --> 00:06:04.163]  And what I think about this situation and where I think it's headed and what my discernment and spiritual gut level site is on this.
[00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:15.451]  But I want first to just pull back out of the emotion, myself included, and I want to analyze the facts here.
[00:06:17.813 --> 00:06:26.295]  We know that there have been six different chemical attacks that have all been confirmed to be staged in the last five years.
[00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:31.517]  A good two years before Trump even got into office, they'd staged several.
[00:06:32.177 --> 00:06:39.439]  And the ISIS and Al Qaeda operatives would fire the chemical weapons and put out promo videos wanting to get the praise like rock stars.
[00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:45.681]  But then the press would still blame the Syrians and the Iranians for it.
[00:06:47.284 --> 00:06:54.370]  And we would come on air and say that is not the case, that is a staged chemical attack, and the UN has been forced to come out and say it, and it's all been confirmed now.
[00:06:54.871 --> 00:06:56.272]  And they're really trying to cover that up.
[00:06:56.412 --> 00:07:07.722]  So, when Trump blew up that chemical weapons dump in Syria, I got really mad at him because Trump knows good and damn well that that was a staged chemical attack.
[00:07:08.102 --> 00:07:13.127]  I thought it meant they were about to escalate like they normally do, but instead he used that to silence the Warhawks.
[00:07:14.793 --> 00:07:18.576]  And to allow Syria to take its country back from really nasty folks.
[00:07:18.616 --> 00:07:19.877]  He made Saudi Arabia stop.
[00:07:20.578 --> 00:07:22.960]  We worked with Iran some to help clean up ISIS.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.143]  But then Iran is now expanding.
[00:07:28.993 --> 00:07:32.975]  And Iran did have its militias attack and take over the embassy.
[00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:34.616]  And they are killing U.S.
[00:07:34.657 --> 00:07:35.177]  contractors.
[00:07:35.217 --> 00:07:36.217]  And they are killing U.S.
[00:07:36.237 --> 00:07:36.518]  troops.
[00:07:37.198 --> 00:07:46.184]  And they've decided that, no, they're going to have an Islamic Republic out of Iran, their own Islamic State, that they set up in 1979, worldwide.
[00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:47.184]  And that's what they teach.
[00:07:47.204 --> 00:07:48.805]  That's what their Ayatollah teaches.
[00:07:49.526 --> 00:07:53.488]  And that's what this top general, who was second in command in Iran, admittedly.
[00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:56.370]  That's what
[00:07:58.095 --> 00:07:59.977]  Soleimani was trying to do.
[00:08:01.878 --> 00:08:09.785]  And so Trump just can't pull us out of Afghanistan and Syria and Iraq, which he's been trying to do, without getting these groups to stop attacking U.S.
[00:08:10.065 --> 00:08:10.405]  interests.
[00:08:12.207 --> 00:08:15.710]  Because Saudi Arabia will then launch an even bigger war, and both sides have nuclear weapons.
[00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.012]  Iran already has nukes, so does Saudi Arabia.
[00:08:19.573 --> 00:08:23.196]  And that's why this is all coming to a head.
[00:08:24.997 --> 00:08:28.261]  And the issue is the delivery systems that Iran has are getting more sophisticated.
[00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.945]  That's why Israel says if it goes much further, they're going to attack.
[00:08:32.305 --> 00:08:41.256]  So regardless of what side you want to be on, we're all on this planet that could end up in a giant new war that rivals anything we've ever seen or could be worse.
[00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:45.776]  And so why have we gotten to this point?
[00:08:46.377 --> 00:08:58.705]  Because the deep state, the permanent bureaucracy, the CFR, the Bilderberg globalist leftist arm of it, that works closely with the neocons, has been double dealing with Iran.
[00:09:00.366 --> 00:09:09.133]  Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Fiona Hill, the General McMaster types, they have been working
[00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:29.709]  Publicly, in shadow diplomacy, to derail everything that Trump's trying to do to bring real detente and a stalemate and an armistice and a ceasefire in Africa and the Middle East and end the globalist strategy of the Arab Spring, of breaking Europe's borders, of flooding Turkey, and of destabilization!
[00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:35.864]  Trump is really pragmatically saying we're not going to do this and the Middle East is not an issue.
[00:09:35.904 --> 00:09:37.866]  We're already energy independent in the U.S.
[00:09:38.566 --> 00:09:40.168]  We need to pivot to deal with China.
[00:09:40.188 --> 00:09:41.028]  They're the real threat.
[00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:45.872]  And the globalists want to divert us and our military and our blood into that sand trap.
[00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:54.379]  And so Trump has legitimately been trying to end those wars and dial them back and scale down.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.564]  And the globalists have been saying he's wrong, he's an idiot, and they've been trying to block it.
[00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:09.754]  Instead of having the deep state side with Iran against Saudi Arabia, or the deep state side with Saudi Arabia over Iran, Trump's tried to say to all the sides, stop it.
[00:10:11.455 --> 00:10:12.275]  But that's not happened.
[00:10:14.296 --> 00:10:23.400]  And so the Ayatollah, after the embassy was taken over, and after the flag and all the rest of it was captured, he came out and he vowed
[00:10:25.137 --> 00:10:27.819]  That Trump could do nothing and that Trump was a joke.
[00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:30.461]  Well, now you see that's not the case.
[00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:31.942]  But why did he do that?
[00:10:32.142 --> 00:10:48.573]  Because continually, the deep state had been giving them intel and advising them to cause a crisis by sinking ships in the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:55.626]  Just like Michael Moore said when President Trump was President-elect, they said, oh, we're going to embarrass him with Iran and with North Korea.
[00:10:57.207 --> 00:11:08.679]  But in both cases, Trump has been able to put pressure like he did with North Korea and get them to come to the table, at least ending the escalation that Kim Jong
[00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:16.793]  Un was involved in trying to start a war with his neighbors under Globalist Direction and Chi-Com Direction.
[00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:19.315]  Trump got him to stop all that, at least, to back off.
[00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:23.417]  They haven't gotten the big permanent deal, but he got him to back off because the U.S.
[00:11:23.457 --> 00:11:25.498]  was about to invade two years ago.
[00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:38.466]  And so, now they're doing that again, and Trump is letting Iran know, just like
[00:11:40.046 --> 00:11:49.804]  The situation with North Korea, that carrot or the stick, if you stop all this, the sanctions will go away and we'll work with you if you keep escalating and working with the deep state.
[00:11:50.566 --> 00:11:58.290]  The international globalist system through the CHICOMS to embarrass America and to sabotage us and to bankrupt our military and our country.
[00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:06.774]  We're going to confront you when you're militarily expanding and when you proportionately start attacking us, we proportionately attack you.
[00:12:07.154 --> 00:12:13.337]  It's going to escalate until we use bunker buster bombs to kill the mullahs in Tehran.
[00:12:14.898 --> 00:12:19.860]  And that's something these individuals understand and get.
[00:12:23.163 --> 00:12:26.905]  And so, that's pragmatically what Trump's doing.
[00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:27.906]  There's a lot of other angles.
[00:12:27.966 --> 00:12:32.409]  Now, there's a big gamble here, but is it really a gamble?
[00:12:32.429 --> 00:12:34.090]  Does Trump really even have a choice?
[00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.451]  We'll explore that.
[00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:37.312]  Tucker Carlson's very upset with Trump.
[00:12:38.313 --> 00:12:41.495]  Obviously, that's a perspective that you can say has a lot of validity.
[00:12:42.856 --> 00:12:44.777]  We're going to play that clip coming up this hour.
[00:12:46.175 --> 00:12:59.925]  But see, just because there's bad people that want war with Iran, just because the neocons are a bunch of liars and planted WMDs and the New York Times helped do it with the Democrats, bipartisan evil, doesn't mean that Trump's new real politic that he's practicing
[00:13:03.297 --> 00:13:03.737]  It's wrong.
[00:13:04.097 --> 00:13:04.738]  It doesn't mean that.
[00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:15.303]  Because, just because the neocons are bad, and the leftists are bad, doesn't mean that Iran and its leadership, it's very unpopular, and mass murders its own people, doesn't mean they're good either.
[00:13:15.883 --> 00:13:16.784]  I don't want a war.
[00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:24.448]  Our own CIA in 1953 overthrew Mohamed Mozadek, who was pro-America.
[00:13:24.828 --> 00:13:26.649]  But he wouldn't follow orders of the globalists.
[00:13:28.806 --> 00:13:31.147]  And so all of this comes out of what the CIA did back then.
[00:13:31.187 --> 00:13:32.767]  So I get regime change isn't good.
[00:13:33.728 --> 00:13:36.849]  Then the CIA helped get rid of the Shah and put in the Ayatollahs.
[00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:39.350]  So there's a lot of triple and double crossing going on here.
[00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.472]  And they want to use Iran to embarrass Trump, just like Jimmy Carter was in 1979.
[00:13:44.832 --> 00:13:50.734]  And Trump has acted decisively so far to block that, and for now is winning the political war.
[00:13:51.274 --> 00:13:53.295]  But what will happen in the next phase?
[00:13:54.349 --> 00:14:12.049]  The big question everybody's asking is how will the Islamic Shiite dictatorship of Iran respond to their co-fuhrer, you have the religious leader and you have the military dictator.
[00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:13.538]  That's admitted.
[00:14:13.578 --> 00:14:22.082]  This guy was probably as powerful as the main royal mullah, the Ayatollah, who traces his royal lineage back to Muhammad.
[00:14:22.222 --> 00:14:25.323]  So the Shiites are a form of religious royalty.
[00:14:26.763 --> 00:14:29.405]  Kim Jong-un is a third generation communist royal.
[00:14:30.205 --> 00:14:39.048]  The Saxe-Coburg Gothas are a, it's got to be 30 generation or so, Transylvanian inbred royalty.
[00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:40.329]  And this
[00:14:42.719 --> 00:15:06.301]  Royalty, this Islamic royalty, has real sleeper cells around the world and they have promised, quote, the Ayatollah put these tweets out this morning, we can put them up later, the Ayatollah has promised, hashtag, savage revenge and to destroy the barbarians.
[00:15:07.591 --> 00:15:14.554]  And I've got some of the video of a speech he gave saying that the world will be Islamic and that they're going to take over and nothing can stop them.
[00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:17.976]  But that's not a threat at all.
[00:15:20.157 --> 00:15:26.220]  They say the world belongs to their version of Islam that's hereditary.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:27.981]  Royalty.
[00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:35.164]  And that we've got to bow down to these dudes that all look exactly the same, are totally inbred and crazy.
[00:15:36.573 --> 00:15:40.456]  And rule over the Iranians, and most of them aren't even Persian.
[00:15:42.238 --> 00:15:43.178]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.861]  Next segment, I'm going to go over the Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:15:46.921 --> 00:15:48.422]  It's top-linked at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:51.165]  Iran has Hezbollah sleeper cells in the U.S.
[00:15:51.305 --> 00:16:02.814]  ready to strike, and it goes through the FBI reports, the confirmation of the plans to attack JFK and Pearson Airports alone, and a lot more.
[00:16:04.155 --> 00:16:09.759]  We'll cover that next segment, but let's look right now geopolitically at what's going on.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:16.044]  Punch up a map of the Middle East right here, going into Central Asia.
[00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:25.592]  And Iran is perfectly situated between Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Turkmenistan.
[00:16:27.142 --> 00:16:36.151]  Azerbaijan, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, Persian Gulf.
[00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:38.894]  All of it.
[00:16:40.435 --> 00:16:41.877]  They're right in the middle of the chessboard.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.706]  Zbigniew Brzezinski has a geopolitical theorem that has been adopted by the globalists.
[00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.050]  We're good to go.
[00:17:10.325 --> 00:17:23.331]  And so yeah, it's a good thing in my view that their militias working with Russia and the United States were able to kick ISIS and Al Qaeda out of here, when back before Hillary Clinton and the globalists were actually aiding that to cause a civil war.
[00:17:24.232 --> 00:17:37.698]  But then they did a double deal, Hillary and Obama, and made a deal with Iran to give them billions and billions of dollars and then let them go around and expand proxy wars all over the Middle East and all over Africa and to put their sleeper cells in Europe
[00:17:39.369 --> 00:17:40.149]  And the United States.
[00:17:40.209 --> 00:17:41.730]  And so contractors and U.S.
[00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:49.832]  troops and others are getting killed all over the place as Trump tries to pull back and tries to leave the region for all intents and purposes compared to the escalations.
[00:17:50.172 --> 00:17:51.652]  And they're seeing that as weakness.
[00:17:52.933 --> 00:17:59.134]  And they're pushing now saying, oh, we're going to try to make Syria Shiite.
[00:18:00.334 --> 00:18:02.875]  We're going to try to make all these other places Shiite.
[00:18:04.195 --> 00:18:06.056]  And we're going to attack your embassy.
[00:18:07.233 --> 00:18:10.654]  Because you bombed some of our paramilitary taking over areas of Iraq.
[00:18:12.514 --> 00:18:14.315]  And what did the Ayatollah say to Trump?
[00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:23.357]  He taunted Trump before the Soleimani strike, said, you can do nothing.
[00:18:25.597 --> 00:18:27.978]  You can't do anything.
[00:18:28.738 --> 00:18:29.738]  Now why would he say that?
[00:18:29.778 --> 00:18:32.459]  Again, think about the treason.
[00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:56.869]  People that claim they're American citizens even though they're globalists of John Kerry and Barack Obama who travel the world from Korea to Japan to China to Iran to Israel to Germany to the UK to Canada to Argentina Brazil saying don't listen to Trump
[00:18:57.901 --> 00:18:59.362]  He's going to be gone soon.
[00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:00.182]  He's a loser.
[00:19:00.242 --> 00:19:00.863]  He's an idiot.
[00:19:01.203 --> 00:19:13.929]  In fact, if you embarrass him by sinking some ships in the Strait of Hormuz or in the Persian Gulf, that'll help remove him back at home, and he's not going to get the backing.
[00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.552]  Now, here's the danger that Tucker Carlson talks about, and I agree with him.
[00:19:19.012 --> 00:19:20.313]  You've got the neocons.
[00:19:21.308 --> 00:19:24.710]  Who double deal and who worked with Iran before to embarrass Jimmy Carter?
[00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.691]  Oh yeah, they work with the Iranians.
[00:19:26.711 --> 00:19:29.913]  The Iranians are super beyond duplicitous.
[00:19:30.813 --> 00:19:38.057]  I mean, when you think about the Iranian mullahs and triple, quadruple games of chess, it's not even strategic.
[00:19:38.317 --> 00:19:39.118]  It's mental illness.
[00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:44.501]  Straight shooting is the most sophisticated thing in the universe.
[00:19:44.841 --> 00:19:46.522]  Innocence is the most sophisticated thing.
[00:19:46.902 --> 00:19:48.983]  It's so simple, it's complex.
[00:19:49.023 --> 00:19:49.984]  These guys don't get it.
[00:19:50.845 --> 00:19:57.571]  They don't get the Christian or Anglo-Saxon Legos or Nexus or Genesis.
[00:19:58.091 --> 00:19:58.612]  Very sad.
[00:19:58.932 --> 00:19:59.873]  It's very smart folks.
[00:20:00.453 --> 00:20:08.780]  But it's constant screwing each other, constant double-dealing, constant plans within plans, all about vengeance, all about double-dealing, all about screwing somebody over.
[00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:11.623]  They got like a thousand names for knife over there.
[00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:17.262]  And the neocons have been working with them, propping them up the whole time as well.
[00:20:17.942 --> 00:20:25.305]  Because it's an authoritarian regime that they can work with, and when everybody else has sanctions on them, remember Halliburton and Dick Cheney were still making money with them.
[00:20:25.705 --> 00:20:30.307]  So, tyrants like to work with tyrants, and what you see on the surface is not what's really going on.
[00:20:31.087 --> 00:20:45.232]  With the neocons and with John Kerry and the leftists and the globalists that the internationalists that have been working with Iran and the nuclear deal and Trump is saying it's crazy to let Iran expand around the world and export their Islamic jihad.
[00:20:47.631 --> 00:20:56.197]  So we're going to tell you stop expanding or we're going to stop you because you've openly declared that you're going to nuke Israel as soon as you can.
[00:20:56.357 --> 00:21:00.719]  And whether you love Israel or hate Israel or neutral on it, Israel has 600, 700 nukes.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.180]  They're not going anywhere.
[00:21:02.421 --> 00:21:12.047]  So if you let Iran attack them because they're crazy or because they think they have a right to rule, it'll cause a new nuclear war.
[00:21:12.407 --> 00:21:16.590]  And if you don't do something about Saudi Arabia, they're going to attack them.
[00:21:17.307 --> 00:21:20.430]  And so, we're not the world's peacekeeper under Trump.
[00:21:20.911 --> 00:21:25.375]  He's just trying to de-escalate all of this and what the globalists set up.
[00:21:25.415 --> 00:21:32.703]  In Trump's own words, I'm trying to fix what Obama and Hillary and the establishment did of getting all these groups fighting and stirring them up to control them.
[00:21:32.963 --> 00:21:35.966]  That's dangerous, Trump has said, and he wants to stop that.
[00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:41.387]  So I think I pretty much already told you where I stand on what Trump's done.
[00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:45.888]  But I'll get into details of that when we come back, and then I'll get to the Tucker Carlson, and then I'll get to your calls.
[00:21:45.908 --> 00:21:49.429]  We're going to look at some of the strike footage and the rest of it.
[00:21:49.489 --> 00:21:57.471]  Please remember how we reach new people, is when you share the links at InfoWars.com forward slash show, band dot video, and the Alex Jones section and more.
[00:21:57.732 --> 00:21:58.832]  That's how we reach new people.
[00:21:58.852 --> 00:22:02.433]  Remember, they're trying to ban this show because we're really covering real facts.
[00:22:02.813 --> 00:22:06.955]  And the establishment doesn't want you thinking about how the world really works, who the different factions are.
[00:22:06.975 --> 00:22:09.576]  They just want you to mindlessly take a side.
[00:22:10.237 --> 00:22:12.798]  Well, we do have a side and it's called the truth.
[00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:13.899]  We'll be back.
[00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:14.539]  Stay with us.
[00:22:14.659 --> 00:22:15.579]  Please spread those links.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.183]  It's only the third live broadcast of 2020 and things are already getting crazy.
[00:22:23.823 --> 00:22:25.744]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[00:22:28.286 --> 00:22:30.707]  Well, did President Trump have any choice?
[00:22:32.301 --> 00:22:41.804]  But to strike and kill basically the top leadership of the Iranian military and their terror networks worldwide.
[00:22:43.284 --> 00:22:44.245]  Yes, Trump had a choice.
[00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:49.406]  He could do nothing like he did the last 10 ships or so they blew up and sunk.
[00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:53.047]  Or the last times they shot and killed US troops all over the Middle East.
[00:22:53.787 --> 00:22:57.649]  Or the other times that they're killing contractors that are just simply there working in oil fields.
[00:22:59.489 --> 00:23:01.830]  Iran is muscling its way through the Middle East.
[00:23:04.116 --> 00:23:06.738]  It believes it can topple the other Islamic regimes.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:17.485]  And if that happens, you'll have an organized Islamic force even more deadly with three billion Muslims ready to take over what's left of the rotting West.
[00:23:18.225 --> 00:23:29.553]  So long term, taking Iran out of the control of the Islamists that captured the secular country and 70 plus percent in internal polls hate it.
[00:23:31.089 --> 00:23:35.813]  And if we could take that away from the radical Islamists, that'd be a big victory for humanity, wouldn't it?
[00:23:38.135 --> 00:23:47.662]  But you see, our criminal globalist government in 79 removed the Shah and put the Ayatollah Khomeini in.
[00:23:48.743 --> 00:23:51.605]  And then they double-crossed Jimmy Carter.
[00:23:53.527 --> 00:23:55.468]  And they sabotaged the raid and all of it.
[00:23:55.688 --> 00:23:57.490]  You say, oh great, that's what got Ronald Reagan in.
[00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.292]  The point is, it's the groups behind that.
[00:24:01.755 --> 00:24:08.001]  And Trump is saying, I'm not going to be like Jimmy Carter, and I'm not going to be like JFK with the Bay of Pigs and all this crap.
[00:24:08.702 --> 00:24:11.645]  He's not telling anybody what's going on.
[00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:14.167]  He's fired the moles in the National Security Council.
[00:24:14.527 --> 00:24:21.334]  He's not telling Pelosi and the House and Senate Intelligence Committee what he's doing now.
[00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:22.355]  You know why?
[00:24:22.415 --> 00:24:26.179]  Because they're globalists, a lot of them, and they're leaking the information.
[00:24:28.126 --> 00:24:29.087]  And so do I like war?
[00:24:29.227 --> 00:24:29.967]  Absolutely not.
[00:24:30.047 --> 00:24:34.389]  I was against the last string of wars because they were based on lies.
[00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:36.030]  They were based on false flags.
[00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:49.758]  They were based on yellow cake and uranium and aluminum tubes and nuclear reactors and centrifuges with anthrax and Colin Powell holding it up in his hand knowing he was a liar.
[00:24:50.458 --> 00:24:52.599]  I was on over 100 radio stations in 2001.
[00:24:56.547 --> 00:24:59.990]  Popular conservative talk shows, but I was against expansion of that war.
[00:25:00.831 --> 00:25:06.715]  I was against the millions of dead Iraqis because they were a secular government originally put in by policies of Eisenhower.
[00:25:07.856 --> 00:25:17.284]  And the deep state wanted to get rid of Saddam because they wanted to make worse things happen and have a civil war there, which you now see to bring down those seven countries that Wesley Clark later talked about.
[00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:23.489]  Trump is going back to the Eisenhower policy of trying to stabilize countries and westernize them.
[00:25:23.869 --> 00:25:24.590]  That's what I want.
[00:25:28.601 --> 00:25:38.028]  So when we see, oh, Trump's going along with the plan now to bring down one of the final countries in that hit list that General Clark talked about that's bipartisan, that's not, in my view, what's happening.
[00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:44.113]  We know John Kerry and Obama and Hillary have worked with the Iranians.
[00:25:44.133 --> 00:25:45.154]  They've gone to Iran.
[00:25:45.654 --> 00:25:51.739]  Kerry has and others who openly say Trump is weak embarrass him militarily.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.122]  And so it's very bold to not just sink some Iranian patrol boat or
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.902]  Hit some militia with some more fighter jets.
[00:25:58.942 --> 00:26:03.206]  That's what, that's what Bill Clinton did when he was very unpopular in an impeachment.
[00:26:04.907 --> 00:26:08.330]  You know, they're running the headlines everywhere, which I think we should look at, because it's historic.
[00:26:09.031 --> 00:26:17.318]  Those headlines, one of them's on DrudgeReport.com, of Bill Clinton impeachs, bombs Iraq.
[00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:21.302]  Impeachment vote in house delayed as Clinton launches Iraq airstrike.
[00:26:21.662 --> 00:26:22.883]  Saudi military need to move swiftly.
[00:26:22.903 --> 00:26:23.204]  But you see,
[00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:31.500]  Nothing had actually happened in Iraq when he did that, or when he bombed an aspirin factory in Sudan before that, as a distraction.
[00:26:32.301 --> 00:26:33.081]  And that was confirmed.
[00:26:33.802 --> 00:26:34.562]  This is real.
[00:26:35.523 --> 00:26:36.383]  We've been attacked.
[00:26:36.723 --> 00:26:37.884]  The embassy was attacked.
[00:26:38.464 --> 00:26:40.926]  Because they've been probing and we've been putting up with it.
[00:26:41.906 --> 00:26:47.049]  And so instead of bombing an aspirin factory, Trump boldly killed
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:55.802]  The leader of the organization that has sleeper cells inside the United States and inside Europe, and now that's the gamble.
[00:26:55.862 --> 00:26:59.463]  They may really strike, even though that'll blow up in their face, and the U.S.
[00:26:59.483 --> 00:27:02.904]  will retaliate even bigger, and this could escalate into a wider regional war.
[00:27:03.244 --> 00:27:05.804]  They're definitely going to try to block the Strait of Hormuz and drive up oil prices.
[00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:06.845]  That's already starting to happen.
[00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:15.707]  And so this is a really bad decision, but it's one of the best decisions you could make out of a list of even worse decisions.
[00:27:18.916 --> 00:27:23.298]  I'm going to play some of what Tucker Carlson has to say about this from his perspective, which I agree with that perspective.
[00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:30.702]  You know, we've got a bunch of other guests coming on, like Syrian Girl and others that have been over there and live there and, you know, say that Trump's wrong.
[00:27:30.722 --> 00:27:31.663]  We're going to hear that perspective.
[00:27:31.823 --> 00:27:32.463]  We're not a cult.
[00:27:33.244 --> 00:27:33.744]  We have debates.
[00:27:33.764 --> 00:27:36.786]  We're going to open the phones up and you can agree, disagree, give us your expertise.
[00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:37.986]  Maybe you live in Iran.
[00:27:38.006 --> 00:27:38.807]  Maybe you live in the Middle East.
[00:27:38.827 --> 00:27:39.687]  Maybe you've been in the military.
[00:27:40.068 --> 00:27:40.968]  Maybe you think I'm wrong.
[00:27:40.988 --> 00:27:41.749]  Maybe you think Trump's wrong.
[00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:42.389]  I want to hear it.
[00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:43.149]  I respect you.
[00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.751]  This is the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:27:46.687 --> 00:27:50.368]  And a lot of the commands are when you call in with your ideas and what you think ought to be done.
[00:27:50.589 --> 00:27:52.389]  Because I think you're amazing.
[00:27:52.769 --> 00:27:54.530]  And I really like the show when I take calls.
[00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.110]  That's why we do it.
[00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.651]  877-789-2539.
[00:27:55.671 --> 00:27:55.911]  877-789-Alex.
[00:27:55.931 --> 00:27:55.991]  877-789-2539.
[00:27:56.031 --> 00:27:57.971]  Let's give first time callers a chance in the first round.
[00:27:58.112 --> 00:28:01.333]  And then you can call in if you're a regular caller, you know, next hour or so.
[00:28:01.353 --> 00:28:01.493]  Please.
[00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:01.553]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:13.012 --> 00:28:14.073]  We'll go to your calls when we come back.
[00:28:14.153 --> 00:28:16.774]  I will hit the sleeper cell news, because that's really serious.
[00:28:17.214 --> 00:28:31.942]  And not just if the Iranian military gives those orders, because remember, it's a governmental, Islamic, worldwide system where religion, the economy, and the military are fused in a takeover, in a jihad, that most experts are agreeing could trigger World War III.
[00:28:32.892 --> 00:28:41.895]  Well, we're already in a slow-motion war with globalism and radical Islam, trying to get rid of Christianity in the West, because no one can compete with the Renaissance Christian economy.
[00:28:41.935 --> 00:28:43.035]  Everybody wants to be in there.
[00:28:43.276 --> 00:28:44.936]  Everybody wants to experience the fruits of it.
[00:28:45.576 --> 00:28:50.018]  So that's why radical Islam, globalist systems work together with the chi-coms.
[00:28:50.978 --> 00:28:52.939]  The chi-coms don't let Islam into their country.
[00:28:53.079 --> 00:28:54.199]  They put you in a death camp.
[00:28:54.759 --> 00:28:55.360]  I think that's wrong.
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.901]  But the point is, they know it's an expansionist, authoritarian thing, competing with them.
[00:29:00.101 --> 00:29:01.842]  But they'll use it against us all day long.
[00:29:03.948 --> 00:29:04.008]  And
[00:29:21.858 --> 00:29:26.742]  Liberal egalitarianism that the fascist left is trying to overthrow because they're threatened by it.
[00:29:26.762 --> 00:29:27.823]  They're on the Chicon payroll.
[00:29:28.403 --> 00:29:30.585]  The left of today is an occultic group.
[00:29:31.185 --> 00:29:32.847]  Don't confuse leftists with liberal.
[00:29:33.107 --> 00:29:35.089]  Prager University has the seminal video on that.
[00:29:39.772 --> 00:29:41.854]  So we're gonna break it all down today.
[00:29:43.635 --> 00:29:48.139]  But let's roll some of the footage of the strike from the Reaper
[00:29:49.755 --> 00:29:51.636]  Drones, the robot did the killing.
[00:29:52.897 --> 00:29:58.121]  And then we'll show you some of the footage from the ground as well.
[00:29:58.181 --> 00:29:59.862]  But those guys thought they were untouchable.
[00:29:59.922 --> 00:30:01.603]  They thought they were working with the deep state.
[00:30:01.643 --> 00:30:02.644]  They thought Trump was weak.
[00:30:03.264 --> 00:30:04.965]  Well, now they think different.
[00:30:05.005 --> 00:30:08.568]  So I think Trump, who's shown real restraint,
[00:30:09.718 --> 00:30:13.222]  When the deep state's trying to set him up with this Iran conflict, let them know, hey, we're serious.
[00:30:14.022 --> 00:30:17.506]  And so you better understand that when you escalate, it's going to get a lot more serious from there on.
[00:30:17.906 --> 00:30:19.127]  And I think that's peace through strength.
[00:30:19.488 --> 00:30:20.068]  It's a gamble.
[00:30:20.148 --> 00:30:21.350]  Things could go desperately wrong.
[00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.892]  I think we're going to find out very, very soon how they're going to respond.
[00:30:23.912 --> 00:30:28.397]  They've got to respond and look strong to the cult they've got running their country.
[00:30:29.926 --> 00:30:31.347]  And so we're going to break it all down today.
[00:30:31.367 --> 00:30:32.748]  I'll get to the Tucker Carlson when we come back.
[00:30:32.968 --> 00:30:34.009]  Sleep yourselves and then your calls.
[00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.032]  Andrew, Richard, many others that are already lining up on this live Friday edition.
[00:30:38.052 --> 00:30:40.274]  The Nolan Schroer is coming up today, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:30:40.294 --> 00:30:40.774]  Don't forget that.
[00:30:40.814 --> 00:30:45.798]  I'm coming in Saturday and Sunday to do special events and the regular Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:30:46.379 --> 00:30:47.460]  broadcast as well.
[00:30:48.612 --> 00:30:51.215]  Please remember, without your financial support, we're not here.
[00:30:51.756 --> 00:30:53.679]  We've been demonized, sued, attacked by the globalists.
[00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:54.280]  That's fine.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.121]  You're supporting us.
[00:30:55.201 --> 00:30:55.942]  We're overcoming it.
[00:30:56.182 --> 00:30:56.883]  We're still on air.
[00:30:56.923 --> 00:30:58.466]  We're expanding in some ways thanks to you.
[00:30:58.906 --> 00:31:01.390]  The year-end sale is extended for three more days.
[00:31:03.803 --> 00:31:04.163]  We're good to go.
[00:31:22.176 --> 00:31:23.757]  I totally understand being against these wars.
[00:31:23.797 --> 00:31:24.598]  I've been against all of them.
[00:31:53.058 --> 00:31:54.338]  Vietnam, we weren't allowed to win that.
[00:31:54.378 --> 00:31:55.279]  That was all a stage deal.
[00:31:55.299 --> 00:31:59.980]  It meant to cause fissures here in the United States, a huge province for the military-industrial complex.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.741]  And Trump was against the 2003 Iraq invasion.
[00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:06.762]  And Trump's been trying to get our troops out.
[00:32:08.042 --> 00:32:10.783]  But Iran's been attacking our interests and they think it's weak.
[00:32:12.091 --> 00:32:13.371]  That we haven't stood up to them.
[00:32:13.572 --> 00:32:19.674]  And you know, just because America's had some corrupt bad people running it for a while, doesn't mean that everybody else is good.
[00:32:19.734 --> 00:32:29.077]  Like the Chi-Coms grabbing the South China Sea and militarily attacking Vietnam and funding all these different invasions for the UN and the United States.
[00:32:30.057 --> 00:32:33.198]  So I don't, like a chicken hawk, feel good about people dying.
[00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:38.180]  And I don't enjoy wars just because I fantasize about how it's manly.
[00:32:39.821 --> 00:32:40.521]  But Trump has
[00:32:41.792 --> 00:32:44.496]  Boldly said, look, we'll just kill your leadership.
[00:32:45.577 --> 00:32:46.739]  You try to take over our embassy.
[00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:48.181]  They really did that.
[00:32:48.281 --> 00:32:49.943]  They're really pushing all of this.
[00:32:51.906 --> 00:32:54.008]  They're really sinking ships and mining ships.
[00:32:54.229 --> 00:32:56.351]  And my own listeners are like, oh no, it's a false flag.
[00:32:56.372 --> 00:32:58.014]  And it turns out Iran is doing that.
[00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:03.447]  But why are they doing it to embarrass Trump, and then denying it, and later admitting it?
[00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:14.514]  Because they're working with the deep state, just like they did with China, telling North Korea to suddenly escalate on Trump, and start firing missiles at Japan, and threatening to invade the South.
[00:33:14.574 --> 00:33:19.818]  And Trump had the military build up, they were gonna go in, told China, China said, okay, stop!
[00:33:20.558 --> 00:33:23.660]  Those were tests Trump went through to become president.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.482]  And now, in the last year of his presidency, if he doesn't get re-elected, with 304 days left,
[00:33:29.445 --> 00:33:31.126]  What was he supposed to do when they did that to the embassy?
[00:33:33.906 --> 00:33:42.669]  And then there's the top general, with the head of the global militia, they're meeting at the airport, like it's all a big joke, and the Ayatollah is saying, you're a joke, you can quote, do nothing!
[00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.031]  You can't do anything, close quote.
[00:33:49.571 --> 00:33:54.053]  Because Trump had done nothing, and they believed that we were paralyzed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:55.193 --> 00:33:57.934]  Now the neocons are gonna try to leverage this, and here's the big problem.
[00:34:03.194 --> 00:34:06.015]  Saudi Arabia, Israel, or elements inside our own government.
[00:34:06.075 --> 00:34:08.136]  And I'm not saying Saudi Arabia is all evil.
[00:34:09.276 --> 00:34:13.397]  Their establishment's very bad and we're trying to make them not be like that.
[00:34:13.938 --> 00:34:17.779]  And Israel, I don't dislike Israel, but Israel's got some bad people running it sometimes, too.
[00:34:18.499 --> 00:34:19.179]  Different factions.
[00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:20.940]  And Israel's been caught staging false flags.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.360]  That's in Jerusalem Post.
[00:34:22.741 --> 00:34:26.322]  They helped fund Hamas to counter Hezbollah.
[00:34:27.922 --> 00:34:30.543]  And they helped fund some of the ISIS operations in Syria.
[00:34:30.963 --> 00:34:32.644]  So did the United States under Obama and Hillary.
[00:34:34.662 --> 00:34:37.624]  What if Israel stages a false flag to get us deeper into a war?
[00:34:39.385 --> 00:34:44.348]  You've already had the Iranian rebels firing ICBMs into Riyadh trying to start a war.
[00:34:44.648 --> 00:34:49.030]  So, false flags are still a danger.
[00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:53.793]  And who could pull them to get us into a full-on war with Iran?
[00:34:53.973 --> 00:34:58.476]  Because Iran has now said that they're going to destroy us, they're going to annihilate us.
[00:34:58.896 --> 00:35:02.018]  Hashtag savage revenge.
[00:35:04.855 --> 00:35:07.336]  Well what happens if there's some terror attacks that's not really Iranians?
[00:35:08.076 --> 00:35:19.180]  So I get why this is so dangerous, and I get what is being said by Tucker Carlson, because this could get out of hand really quickly.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.480]  Here's the problem that already got out of hand.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:27.562]  Our criminal government overthrew the elected government of Iran in 53, in Operation Ajax, and they did everything else since then.
[00:35:27.822 --> 00:35:33.124]  And Trump is legitimately trying to end that strategy of tension, that strategy of destabilization, and I like that.
[00:35:34.059 --> 00:35:35.559]  Does it mean that it isn't going to be bloody?
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.920]  Does it mean it isn't going to be a really bad emergency surgery?
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.641]  Does it mean things might not go bad, or even worse?
[00:35:41.981 --> 00:35:42.181]  Yes!
[00:35:42.521 --> 00:35:51.643]  But at a gut level, I know how much the globalists hate Trump, and they hate him really being the president, and I believe he's making the best decisions with the information he's got.
[00:35:52.743 --> 00:35:53.723]  Doesn't mean I like what's happening.
[00:35:54.283 --> 00:35:56.784]  So here's another perspective, then we'll take your calls and get your perspective.
[00:35:56.904 --> 00:35:57.604]  Here's Tucker Carlson.
[00:36:00.987 --> 00:36:05.028]  We have an unexpected Fox News alert for you, something that has just happened in Iraq.
[00:36:05.068 --> 00:36:09.169]  The situation there heating up very quickly, without any debate here in Washington.
[00:36:09.669 --> 00:36:25.772]  Iraqi television has just confirmed that Qasem Soleimani, a former general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and a commander of the Quds Force, has been killed in a rocket attack, apparently initiated by the United States, near the Baghdad airport, along with a top official in the Iraqi Shiite militia.
[00:36:25.792 --> 00:36:27.192]  Now, what were they doing in Iraq?
[00:36:28.865 --> 00:36:29.305]  I don't know.
[00:36:51.212 --> 00:37:01.662]  Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned that the United States is prepared to launch additional preemptive military strikes against Iranian interests in the region, which apparently are what we are seeing right now.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:11.287]  Now again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but America appears to be lumbering toward a new Middle East war.
[00:37:11.708 --> 00:37:16.012]  And we have to say, it's one that official Washington has wanted for decades.
[00:37:16.032 --> 00:37:22.117]  For example, disgraced National Security Advisor John Bolton has made it his life's mission to start a war with Iran.
[00:37:22.197 --> 00:37:24.239]  And tonight, Bolton may be finally getting his wish.
[00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:26.021]  Should you be happy about that?
[00:37:26.201 --> 00:37:26.961]  That's the question.
[00:37:28.058 --> 00:37:37.221]  Well, the last time we took John Bolton's advice in the region, Iran became far more powerful than it was before, before we took John Bolton's advice.
[00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:37.501]  Why?
[00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:40.502]  Because things are never quite as simple as they claim they are in Washington.
[00:37:40.922 --> 00:37:47.585]  In this case, the very people demanding action against Iran tonight, the ones telling you the Persian menace is the greatest threat we face,
[00:37:48.425 --> 00:37:53.770]  Are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion of America now in progress from the South.
[00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:57.753]  The millions, the tens of millions of foreign nationals living among us illegally.
[00:37:58.134 --> 00:38:04.399]  The torrent, more significantly, of Mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire generations of Americans.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.521]  Nobody cares, in case you haven't noticed.
[00:38:06.741 --> 00:38:09.524]  Pay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us.
[00:38:10.044 --> 00:38:11.366]  The real threat is Iran!
[00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:13.250]  Well, they're liars.
[00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:14.291]  They don't care about you.
[00:38:14.311 --> 00:38:15.313]  They don't care about your kids.
[00:38:15.653 --> 00:38:17.295]  They're reckless and incompetent.
[00:38:17.876 --> 00:38:21.461]  And you should keep all of that in mind as War with Iran looms closer tonight.
[00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:24.845]  Kurt Mills is a senior writer at the American Conservative.
[00:38:24.885 --> 00:38:26.467]  He joins us now.
[00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:27.709]  Alright, let's stop there.
[00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.611]  The full interview is thought-provoking.
[00:38:30.651 --> 00:38:31.951]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:38.553]  And I totally agree with Tucker Carlson that we're dealing with a bunch of scum in D.C., a bunch of chicken hawks.
[00:38:39.033 --> 00:38:53.297]  He could have added that Bolton and a whole bunch of other senior neocons were part of companies that got waivers to work with oil companies that made billions in Iran during the sanctions on Iran that Cheney and others got waivers for.
[00:38:53.338 --> 00:38:55.438]  So they are the worst of the worst.
[00:38:55.558 --> 00:38:57.499]  I can't stand John Bolton.
[00:38:58.519 --> 00:38:59.820]  The man is a menace.
[00:39:01.642 --> 00:39:04.024]  That said, the Iranian leadership is a menace.
[00:39:04.745 --> 00:39:08.128]  They mowed down 600 and something of their own people just a few weeks ago.
[00:39:08.468 --> 00:39:10.630]  Women that take off hijabs get killed.
[00:39:12.212 --> 00:39:16.396]  Oh, but don't worry, AOC says they need to put their hijabs back on.
[00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.132]  Oh by the way, she's saying that Trump's doing this to wag the dog.
[00:39:24.292 --> 00:39:27.755]  Clinton was super unpopular and propped up by the system.
[00:39:28.235 --> 00:39:29.716]  Trump's super popular.
[00:39:29.776 --> 00:39:30.796]  I've been saying that for years.
[00:39:31.076 --> 00:39:35.059]  Now even their own internal polls show he's just insanely popular.
[00:39:35.399 --> 00:39:39.762]  Every Democrat I know that is a cognizant person who has a
[00:39:41.303 --> 00:39:41.563]  I don't
[00:39:57.168 --> 00:40:00.211]  The toilet into which the CHICOMS dump it, so let's not blame the Mexicans.
[00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:00.531]  Come on.
[00:40:01.032 --> 00:40:07.457]  Let's blame ourselves for putting up with it and using it and letting the CHICOMS got caught trying to ship enough into the U.S.
[00:40:07.477 --> 00:40:13.303]  through Mexico last year to kill 10.6 billion people if they all took one dose of it.
[00:40:13.843 --> 00:40:16.205]  If you broke it up in that many doses to a lethal dose.
[00:40:17.627 --> 00:40:21.350]  That's more people than there are on the planet by 4 billion almost.
[00:40:24.011 --> 00:40:25.112]  Yes, he's absolutely right.
[00:40:25.232 --> 00:40:26.093]  That's the real menace.
[00:40:26.193 --> 00:40:27.514]  Millions a year dying from this.
[00:40:27.614 --> 00:40:28.715]  Massive suicides.
[00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:30.316]  Occultism.
[00:40:30.356 --> 00:40:31.337]  Falling away from God.
[00:40:31.977 --> 00:40:32.978]  Industry being shut down.
[00:40:33.058 --> 00:40:33.539]  But Trump?
[00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:35.340]  I've got all the real numbers.
[00:40:37.362 --> 00:40:38.322]  He's changed the rules.
[00:40:38.362 --> 00:40:39.023]  The regulations.
[00:40:39.223 --> 00:40:40.104]  He's defeated the courts.
[00:40:40.124 --> 00:40:44.287]  It's taken him three years to now deport people at the border instead of bringing them in and then letting them go.
[00:40:44.868 --> 00:40:45.488]  It's all right here.
[00:40:45.548 --> 00:40:46.049]  It's happening.
[00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:47.650]  Trump's the real deal.
[00:40:50.419 --> 00:40:52.840]  But it doesn't mean that he's doing a great job on a lot of things.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.480]  He's real.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.560]  He's an American president.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.241]  He's really trying to set the country back on the right footing.
[00:40:57.961 --> 00:41:16.145]  But he's letting the big media cartels, big tech cartels, financed by the Koch brothers and others that are financing the Heritage Foundation and the rest of it, literally screw this country over and silence millions of people and use AI in real time to block what people see and do, pre-programmed.
[00:41:16.365 --> 00:41:17.325]  That's not censorship.
[00:41:17.605 --> 00:41:19.486]  That's total surveillance and control.
[00:41:20.714 --> 00:41:23.995]  Even the Washington Post calls it the surveillance apocalypse.
[00:41:24.696 --> 00:41:29.978]  It sounds like I wrote it, or Paul Watson did, or it sounds like Matt Drudge on the radio 20 years ago.
[00:41:32.539 --> 00:41:33.459]  And we were all right.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:42.283]  And so because we're right, and we're credible, and we've done homework, and we know what we're talking about, we're the ones that are under attack and being silenced.
[00:41:44.557 --> 00:41:45.657]  Alright, I'm going to your phone calls.
[00:41:46.218 --> 00:41:49.019]  Dr. Steve Pachanek, who's a real expert on Iran.
[00:41:49.059 --> 00:41:51.620]  He was involved in the whole Carter situation and more.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.340]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:58.282]  Sherian girl, she's really smart and she doesn't agree with Trump right now.
[00:41:59.023 --> 00:41:59.823]  And so much more.
[00:42:00.283 --> 00:42:01.083]  It's all coming up.
[00:42:01.243 --> 00:42:01.884]  Your phone call.
[00:42:02.024 --> 00:42:02.544]  Second hour.
[00:42:02.564 --> 00:42:04.185]  Whatever you do, share the word.
[00:42:06.505 --> 00:42:12.828]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide and I see a lot of callers that say they disagree with me that Trump shouldn't have struck.
[00:42:13.817 --> 00:42:18.002]  I don't want, and again, I'm not waffling because I can't handle people disagreeing with me.
[00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:19.704]  I'm trying to explain.
[00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:21.907]  I understand why Trump did it.
[00:42:22.007 --> 00:42:22.908]  It's very dangerous.
[00:42:25.991 --> 00:42:28.614]  It's a bad option of a whole bunch of other worse options.
[00:42:29.773 --> 00:42:32.435]  And are we just supposed to sit there and let the Iranians do whatever they want?
[00:42:33.135 --> 00:42:34.116]  Blow up some more ships?
[00:42:34.216 --> 00:42:35.136]  Mine some more harbors?
[00:42:36.197 --> 00:42:37.177]  Attack, attack, attack?
[00:42:37.217 --> 00:42:43.741]  Just because the neocons helped stir this up, just because the globalists helped set all this up, doesn't mean we're not still living in it.
[00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:48.824]  So we got a bunch of callers that disagree with me, and I'm gonna go to them.
[00:42:50.728 --> 00:42:52.330]  Paul says complete nonsense.
[00:42:52.871 --> 00:42:53.772]  Terrorism scam.
[00:42:53.792 --> 00:42:54.533]  Trump is wrong.
[00:42:55.113 --> 00:42:56.134]  Cameron lived in Iran.
[00:42:56.174 --> 00:42:56.895]  Comments on attack.
[00:42:56.915 --> 00:42:57.496]  False flag.
[00:42:57.937 --> 00:43:00.039]  Jeff wants to talk about Iran General Trump attack.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.184]  Peter says wants to talk about Iran, Syria, China, Intel, and Ebola.
[00:43:06.146 --> 00:43:09.831]  Tarifh, Louisiana, against Iran war conflict as Trump supporter.
[00:43:11.451 --> 00:43:14.453]  What I haven't hit yet is the sleeper cells.
[00:43:14.473 --> 00:43:18.156]  I always get behind, but I'm going to cover that after I take your calls.
[00:43:18.797 --> 00:43:20.418]  It's top-linked up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:43:20.478 --> 00:43:22.019]  Also has the live feed of the show in it.
[00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:23.861]  Hope you'll share that with folks.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.701]  Let's go to a call right now.
[00:43:39.881 --> 00:43:43.162]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in New Jersey.
[00:43:43.222 --> 00:43:44.262]  Go ahead and thanks for calling.
[00:43:45.063 --> 00:43:45.563]  Hello Alex.
[00:43:45.983 --> 00:43:46.123]  Hi.
[00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:58.828]  Alex, I remember Mike Pompeo a few months ago trying to paint a brush about Iran being the center of exporting terrorism throughout the world.
[00:43:59.489 --> 00:44:04.471]  But if you check from the University of Maryland's website, it's called the
[00:44:06.791 --> 00:44:13.977]  The Global Terrorism Database, and it's actually linked to the Department of Homeland Security, and you research this.
[00:44:14.037 --> 00:44:23.525]  This was a news item several years ago, that 94% of the terrorism throughout the world is Sunni-sponsored terrorism.
[00:44:24.586 --> 00:44:35.875]  As we know, Iran is a Shiite nation, and so if we take out the 94%, then the Shiites are only responsible for 6% of the global terrorism, which is a small percentage.
[00:44:36.616 --> 00:44:39.517]  The fact of the matter is Al-Qaeda was Sunni-sponsored terrorism.
[00:44:40.257 --> 00:44:53.682]  ISIL, Al-Nusra, Jundalat, God's Army, a whole assortment of these global terrorist groups, and they're the ones doing a lot of the atrocities in Africa today.
[00:44:53.782 --> 00:44:57.043]  And Soleimani is the guy that helped take out ISIS in the Middle East.
[00:44:57.834 --> 00:45:13.949]  Exactly, and actually we should almost be thankful to Soleimani because we were allied with him back under Obama around 2015 when ISIL was making forays into northern Iraq, into Mosul, into Crete.
[00:45:14.571 --> 00:45:27.841]  And Soleimani basically led his team, and it wasn't, you know, an officially Iranian army, but a group, I'm sure, of Shiite militias, to drive ISIS out of Iraq, and for that we should be thankful for.
[00:45:28.361 --> 00:45:33.885]  And in a sense, this is what I'm saying about Donald Trump, that he's got to stick with a coherent narrative.
[00:45:34.866 --> 00:45:35.627]  Because remember,
[00:45:36.229 --> 00:45:40.630]  Well, Paul, you sound like a really smart guy that's got a background and a lot of research.
[00:45:41.471 --> 00:45:42.111]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:45:42.131 --> 00:45:43.091]  Everything you're saying is totally true.
[00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:43.911]  And D.C.'
[00:45:43.871 --> 00:45:44.512]  's full of criminals.
[00:45:44.532 --> 00:45:46.472]  They'll turn anything Trump does into something bad.
[00:45:46.492 --> 00:45:47.553]  And this is really dangerous.
[00:45:47.573 --> 00:45:48.933]  Like Tucker Carlson said, we're going to go to break.
[00:45:48.953 --> 00:45:49.713]  I'm going to come back to you.
[00:45:50.193 --> 00:45:51.094]  Because I want to give you the floor.
[00:45:51.274 --> 00:45:51.854]  Smart callers.
[00:45:52.134 --> 00:45:56.435]  But I want to ask you as we come back, Paul, why then did they attack the embassy?
[00:45:56.495 --> 00:45:57.736]  Why are they doing this to the ships?
[00:45:58.456 --> 00:45:59.837]  Why are they shooting stuff down?
[00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:02.518]  Why are they playing into this?
[00:46:02.579 --> 00:46:10.063]  Why are they meeting with the back channel of Obama and Hillary and the deep state, who we know are trying to use Iran to embarrass Trump.
[00:46:10.463 --> 00:46:13.085]  They're using China to try to get North Korea to embarrass America.
[00:46:13.525 --> 00:46:16.407]  And Trump stood up and North Korea backed down.
[00:46:16.427 --> 00:46:20.169]  This is a very strong message to North Korea and to China right now.
[00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:22.110]  And it's about Trump's leadership.
[00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:25.092]  So I get the whole history and the background and all of that.
[00:46:25.112 --> 00:46:26.433]  I'm talking about what Trump did here.
[00:46:27.353 --> 00:46:30.134]  And what do we do when people attack our embassies?
[00:46:30.174 --> 00:46:32.115]  I'm going to ask you that when we come back.
[00:46:32.275 --> 00:46:33.156]  I just asked the question.
[00:46:33.396 --> 00:46:35.357]  We're back in 60 seconds with Paul in New Jersey.
[00:46:35.817 --> 00:46:38.158]  Then we'll go to Andrew and everybody else.
[00:46:38.218 --> 00:46:41.039]  Stay with us on this Live Friday Global Transmission.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:46.062]  Whatever you do, spread the live link from band.video and thedrugreport.com link to our story.
[00:46:47.342 --> 00:46:50.204]  Well, President Trump did something very bold yesterday.
[00:46:51.104 --> 00:46:55.946]  Instead of blowing up some Shiite militia in response to their attack on the U.S.
[00:46:55.986 --> 00:47:01.927]  Embassy, he killed Soleimani, who's basically the leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
[00:47:01.947 --> 00:47:06.209]  They say he's the number two guy, but he ran the show, and the head of their global militia.
[00:47:06.989 --> 00:47:15.892]  And yeah, there's university studies and things that say most exported terrorism is out of Saudi Arabia, is the whole Al-Qaeda variety.
[00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:34.464]  But the Shiites have their political Islamic operations around the world, and they do have the real competent sleeper cells, and they've said they have those sleeper cells, and they've said they're going to have a savage revenge, that's a quote, against us.
[00:47:34.544 --> 00:47:36.526]  So I'm asking the caller Paul,
[00:47:38.334 --> 00:47:43.137]  What do we do then when Iran goes into the embassy?
[00:47:43.157 --> 00:47:45.778]  And I know you're going to say, well, we bombed some of their militias.
[00:47:45.798 --> 00:47:47.839]  Yeah, that were killing contractors.
[00:47:47.879 --> 00:47:51.021]  I mean, Iran is pushing back.
[00:47:51.541 --> 00:47:53.622]  And I know you're going to say, well, we've got sanctions on them.
[00:47:54.643 --> 00:48:00.706]  So you're going to say we're being pushed by Saudi Arabia and Israel into this.
[00:48:01.627 --> 00:48:03.528]  And I think to a certain extent, you're right.
[00:48:04.828 --> 00:48:06.649]  And so what do you think should be done?
[00:48:06.689 --> 00:48:07.570]  Where do you think this is going?
[00:48:08.857 --> 00:48:15.885]  Well, for one, I think the Shiite militias in Iraq are not fully controlled by the Iranians.
[00:48:16.025 --> 00:48:18.628]  I would argue that they're actually a bunch of hotheads.
[00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:21.191]  They form their own factionalized little groups.
[00:48:23.126 --> 00:48:26.367]  And then they go off on their own without orders from Iran.
[00:48:27.408 --> 00:48:37.832]  Just like, by the way, that in eastern Ukraine some of the secessionists and the Donbass go on their own and don't really get their orders from Russia either.
[00:48:37.852 --> 00:48:48.657]  I think the situations are somewhat similar when you have a great power which is sympathetic towards expansionism along their border, but they don't really want to own it.
[00:48:49.747 --> 00:48:51.388]  Understand they don't want a direct connection.
[00:48:51.448 --> 00:48:54.869]  Oh sure, you always have a group rise up and then claim it wants to join you later.
[00:48:54.889 --> 00:48:57.410]  I mean my, not bragging, it's an interesting historical fact.
[00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:07.314]  My ancestors, you know, actually worked with President Jackson more than a decade before Texas seceded from Mexico and it was all a plan.
[00:49:07.334 --> 00:49:08.254]  I mean I'll just be honest.
[00:49:08.294 --> 00:49:09.155]  To come in,
[00:49:10.095 --> 00:49:19.046]  Because, you know, the Mexican government couldn't occupy things, build it up, and then as soon as they tried to ban Protestantism, basically use that as a way to launch Texas.
[00:49:19.346 --> 00:49:21.349]  And so even back then, I mean, the U.S.
[00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:25.113]  government was already planning its western expansion into places like Texas.
[00:49:25.133 --> 00:49:27.876]  So you're absolutely right that that's how these proxy operations work.
[00:49:28.157 --> 00:49:29.078]  That's just textbook.
[00:49:30.225 --> 00:49:45.372]  Yeah, but as for my wish list, you know, we have to remember that that three-quarter-of-a-billion-dollar embassy complex, and really it's more like a fort, was built by the 9-11 culprit George Bush, Jr.
[00:49:45.392 --> 00:49:55.496]  And the fact of the matter is, as an American, I don't really want to kill my way out of keeping that fort over there.
[00:49:56.528 --> 00:49:58.329]  In Iraq, to me it doesn't matter.
[00:49:58.689 --> 00:50:03.372]  To me it's not a big deal if we strategically just pack our bags and retreat.
[00:50:03.492 --> 00:50:04.353]  Oh, I agree with you.
[00:50:04.373 --> 00:50:11.237]  I think Trump's original instinct to pull the hell out of there and let them kill each other, or fix it hopefully, is the right way to go.
[00:50:11.297 --> 00:50:14.959]  But how does he do that then when the neocons on the left are going to call him weak?
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:22.644]  Well, you just let them call you weak and go to the American people and explain it and take it on the stump.
[00:50:23.545 --> 00:50:27.011]  Well, where do you think this is going to end?
[00:50:27.051 --> 00:50:28.954]  Because it could certainly end really bad.
[00:50:28.994 --> 00:50:30.797]  How do you think the Iranians are going to respond?
[00:50:30.817 --> 00:50:32.920]  Or are they smart enough not to escalate?
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.721]  I think they're exactly that.
[00:50:34.781 --> 00:50:35.742]  They won't escalate.
[00:50:35.922 --> 00:50:38.525]  Everything's going to cool down and we'll forget about it in three weeks.
[00:50:38.605 --> 00:50:39.586]  They're smart.
[00:50:39.626 --> 00:50:40.887]  They don't want a direct conflict.
[00:50:40.947 --> 00:50:50.215]  They have to build up still and work on their economy and other issues, stronger alliances with the Chinese and Russia, and build more missiles in their mountain bunkers there.
[00:50:51.116 --> 00:50:53.218]  You know, I think they're a very smart group of people.
[00:50:53.518 --> 00:50:59.564]  And actually, I would argue, if the goal is to rule the Middle East, I would think that you'd want to divide it.
[00:51:00.319 --> 00:51:12.526]  And to divide the Middle East, since Sunnis are about, I think, 85% of the Muslim population in the region, I think it behooves us to make Iran into the enemy.
[00:51:12.606 --> 00:51:19.330]  I think we should make, actually, Iran more influential and more powerful, so then we have a better balance of power.
[00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:24.553]  Sure, but I mean, are you then agreeing with Obama and his shadow diplomacy, what they've been doing?
[00:51:25.063 --> 00:51:27.384]  Well, I like the thought that you'd do it on the cheap.
[00:51:27.404 --> 00:51:35.329]  I don't like that Obama toppled Libya or Syria at all by any means, nor do I want to spread this carnage and turn the whole Middle East into a charnel house.
[00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:39.151]  But I do believe, do it on the cheap.
[00:51:39.291 --> 00:51:41.652]  Let me ask you this, why do you think Trump did this?
[00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:49.456]  I mean, I think he knows that Iran is probing and talking to the deep state and thinks he's weak, and I think he did it to telegraph strength.
[00:51:49.476 --> 00:51:52.778]  Very likely, but I think the Iranians are going to back down out of this.
[00:51:52.798 --> 00:51:53.619]  They're smart cookies.
[00:51:54.304 --> 00:51:55.808]  All right, smart caller, Paul.
[00:51:56.389 --> 00:51:56.890]  Thank you, sir.
[00:51:58.013 --> 00:52:00.799]  You can tell that guy's definitely been working in the State Department or something.
[00:52:01.971 --> 00:52:03.752]  Speaking of the State Department, Dr. Stephen Cheney's coming up.
[00:52:04.313 --> 00:52:05.333]  He's an Iran expert.
[00:52:06.094 --> 00:52:09.096]  By the way, a lot of listeners go, this guy says he ran this operation, that operation.
[00:52:09.156 --> 00:52:11.638]  He really did run a lot of big operations and was involved in a bunch of the others.
[00:52:11.938 --> 00:52:14.960]  When he's sitting there rattling stuff off, it was about his memoir.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.683]  That's why he rattled off 10 minutes of stuff and I stopped him because it's just, it's so, so over the top.
[00:52:19.943 --> 00:52:20.744]  But it really is true.
[00:52:20.764 --> 00:52:23.085]  There's a lot of people like that, that have done a lot of stuff.
[00:52:23.766 --> 00:52:26.447]  I mean, gosh, I've had cousins and stuff that were in the Army 35 years.
[00:52:26.508 --> 00:52:27.848]  They'll hardly tell you stories, but they do.
[00:52:27.928 --> 00:52:28.369]  It's just like,
[00:52:28.949 --> 00:52:31.832]  One after the other of the wild stuff goes on you never hear about.
[00:52:31.872 --> 00:52:33.953]  It's just crazy.
[00:52:34.654 --> 00:52:45.943]  My family definitely doesn't want to go to war with Iran because it's all classified stuff but I've talked to some that let's just see we got satellites they can see down into the dirt and that Iran's had nukes for at least 15 years folks.
[00:52:46.223 --> 00:52:47.024]  So it's bad.
[00:52:47.424 --> 00:52:48.325]  So is Saudi Arabia.
[00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:51.368]  So this place is a time bomb.
[00:52:51.988 --> 00:52:52.689]  A time bomb.
[00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:55.971]  Okay let's go ahead and talk to
[00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:00.072]  Andrew in Idaho and Cameron.
[00:53:00.292 --> 00:53:00.972]  Andrew, welcome.
[00:53:02.173 --> 00:53:03.634]  Hey, it's good to talk to you again, Alex.
[00:53:04.334 --> 00:53:05.195]  I don't know if you remember me.
[00:53:05.295 --> 00:53:07.116]  I told you I've been with you since Bohemian Grove.
[00:53:07.937 --> 00:53:11.599]  Well, I do remember a lot of callers calling about Bohemian Grove, Andrew, but thanks for calling.
[00:53:11.619 --> 00:53:12.220]  What's on your mind?
[00:53:15.021 --> 00:53:17.243]  I'm just really worried about the direction we're headed right now.
[00:53:18.243 --> 00:53:21.325]  Looks like we've drifted a long way since Ron Paul.
[00:53:21.366 --> 00:53:24.848]  If I could just start off real quick just so you know that my wife says I'm your biggest fan.
[00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:30.066]  Well, I'm a big fan of you folks keeping us on air in defiance of the globalists, so God bless you, brother.
[00:53:31.127 --> 00:53:33.209]  I've spent thousands, thousands on your store.
[00:53:33.229 --> 00:53:35.171]  I could probably give you the best product push you've ever had, but I can't.
[00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:36.733]  Well, that will give us the product push.
[00:53:36.753 --> 00:53:41.898]  I haven't done one yet this hour, and we're barely keeping up the size we are, so we need folks to buy the products.
[00:53:42.158 --> 00:53:42.819]  They're great products.
[00:53:42.839 --> 00:53:43.820]  Which products do you like best?
[00:53:45.141 --> 00:53:48.865]  I think I have almost every one of your products, but I can't do a push for your products right now.
[00:53:49.065 --> 00:53:49.385]  I can't.
[00:53:50.564 --> 00:53:51.004]  I understand.
[00:53:51.044 --> 00:53:52.625]  I thought I was just your segwaying.
[00:53:52.645 --> 00:53:53.525]  If you'd like to, go ahead.
[00:53:53.545 --> 00:53:53.745]  Sure.
[00:53:54.405 --> 00:53:57.767]  What's your take on, you said, drone strikes, Obama, sleeper cells, due process?
[00:53:58.827 --> 00:54:03.849]  I just feel like we've drifted a long way from, you know, pulling out and becoming fiscally responsible.
[00:54:03.869 --> 00:54:09.211]  No, I understand, but they've got us caught, sir.
[00:54:09.251 --> 00:54:10.311]  Here's the deal.
[00:54:10.751 --> 00:54:11.572]  I don't want this war.
[00:54:11.592 --> 00:54:13.172]  I don't like what happened yesterday, okay?
[00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:14.913]  It doesn't make me get excited.
[00:54:16.428 --> 00:54:16.568]  Yeah.
[00:54:16.648 --> 00:54:27.674]  In a way of like feeling tough and powerful but at the same time you understand that the globalists are working with Iran at a certain level to try to make Trump look stupid.
[00:54:30.416 --> 00:54:33.478]  And they can only make him look stupid by coercing him into a war.
[00:54:34.378 --> 00:54:37.940]  That's the best way to make him and our entire party has become
[00:54:39.516 --> 00:54:43.980]  Very different from where we were when we were supporting Ron Paul.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.641]  And that is the way it is.
[00:54:45.941 --> 00:54:47.182]  No, you're right.
[00:54:47.222 --> 00:54:57.949]  The Libertarian Nationalist Party that kind of formed, that helped get Trump in, we don't want to be co-opted if Trump becomes neoconian.
[00:54:58.930 --> 00:54:59.771]  Exactly.
[00:54:59.811 --> 00:55:00.791]  I keep seeing everywhere.
[00:55:00.831 --> 00:55:02.553]  I mean, I am defending against taxation.
[00:55:02.673 --> 00:55:08.557]  I see people writing, I'm glad my tax dollars went to drop by, you know, to kill a terrorist.
[00:55:09.218 --> 00:55:15.601]  With Anwar al-Awlaki, he was the first American citizen killed, if any of us can remember, that was killed without due process under Obama.
[00:55:16.101 --> 00:55:25.286]  During that time, I was defending, you know, criticizing Obama, defending our Constitution against liberals like my sister.
[00:55:26.707 --> 00:55:27.507]  I hear you.
[00:55:27.607 --> 00:55:32.149]  And now it's the left loves all these wars and says Trump's wrong for not wanting to blow up North Korea.
[00:55:32.409 --> 00:55:32.890]  Good points.
[00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:33.490]  God bless you.
[00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:34.190]  Thank you, Andrew.
[00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:35.011]  Tell your wife I said hi.
[00:55:36.772 --> 00:55:38.834]  I just spent 10 minutes with one caller, two minutes with another.
[00:55:39.175 --> 00:55:40.056]  I got to get to everybody.
[00:55:40.076 --> 00:55:45.181]  So when we come back, I'm going to go to Cameron, Josh, Jeff, Peter, Bob, Tyreef.
[00:55:45.242 --> 00:55:46.623]  We'll go to Tyreef soon.
[00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:51.328]  We're going to go to Mo and Justin and Richard and everybody on the other side.
[00:55:51.388 --> 00:55:52.149]  Speaking of the products.
[00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:54.232]  These are the biggest sales we've ever had.
[00:55:54.392 --> 00:55:56.275]  We just escalated them last year into this year.
[00:55:56.715 --> 00:55:58.818]  A bunch of stuff's already selling out or has sold out.
[00:55:59.298 --> 00:56:04.065]  So the big mega sale is still going for items that haven't sold out or are about to sell out.
[00:56:04.085 --> 00:56:10.473]  Because some things that we're not going to get for a few months, I'm going to go ahead and, you know, go back to the regular price and hopefully get some money in to fund our operation.
[00:56:11.354 --> 00:56:11.674]  We're good to go.
[00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:32.972]  Here's my position.
[00:56:33.452 --> 00:56:35.614]  I understand why President Trump did what he did.
[00:56:36.254 --> 00:56:39.056]  Iran clearly was striking our installations through proxies.
[00:56:40.197 --> 00:56:45.721]  And the leaders of the Iranian international network are feared by the establishment.
[00:56:45.881 --> 00:56:49.823]  They're a real group that can really strike around the planet.
[00:56:51.365 --> 00:56:55.167]  They're not a synthetic system the globalists control like ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:56:56.288 --> 00:57:00.431]  And the globalists see it as returning balance to things that Iran's
[00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:07.329]  And Trump wants to look strong for North Korea, and look strong for China.
[00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:09.370]  It's a very decisive, bold move.
[00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:12.971]  It's not the normal Obama-Aspirin factory like Bill Clinton would do.
[00:57:16.512 --> 00:57:18.892]  That said, Trump got elected on ending these wars.
[00:57:20.113 --> 00:57:22.453]  And once you start feeding the beast, it's just gonna want more.
[00:57:24.054 --> 00:57:31.336]  So... At a sick level, though, I like seeing action out of Trump and him being himself, because this is Trump.
[00:57:33.362 --> 00:57:34.583]  This isn't the neocons.
[00:57:34.723 --> 00:57:36.765]  The left's totally freaked out right now.
[00:57:37.285 --> 00:57:38.786]  The neocons are freaked out right now.
[00:57:38.806 --> 00:57:40.568]  Because he looks so presidential.
[00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:42.830]  It is a bold move.
[00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:51.497]  Not that it's presidential to kill people, but to go right after those guys who are really bad news when it comes to being able to actually project terrorist force.
[00:57:51.877 --> 00:57:53.418]  They've got sleeper cells in the U.S.
[00:57:53.438 --> 00:57:54.779]  They've got sleeper cells all over Europe.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.581]  And Iran may just go crazy.
[00:58:01.098 --> 00:58:02.940]  But I wish it wouldn't have happened.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.841]  I wish that we weren't in this crisis with Iran.
[00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:09.925]  But believe me, if Iran doesn't think Trump's in charge, now they do.
[00:58:10.906 --> 00:58:16.891]  And that's really the final reason Trump did this, is the back-channel stuff with Obama and Hillary and Kerry.
[00:58:17.211 --> 00:58:20.073]  Kerry goes over there and says, don't listen to Trump, he'll be out soon.
[00:58:20.093 --> 00:58:20.954]  Ha ha ha.
[00:58:21.174 --> 00:58:23.596]  And that's why the Ayatollah said, you can't do anything.
[00:58:25.057 --> 00:58:27.339]  And that's not...
[00:58:28.567 --> 00:58:35.192]  That kind of blustering worked with other people because Obama and Hillary, those are puppets of the globalists.
[00:58:35.393 --> 00:58:36.093]  They don't run things.
[00:58:36.113 --> 00:58:38.915]  With somebody like Trump, Trump wants peace.
[00:58:38.955 --> 00:58:40.457]  He wants to be the guy to get the peace prize.
[00:58:40.497 --> 00:58:41.557]  He wants to reverse all this.
[00:58:42.298 --> 00:58:46.221]  But I think people better understand that you don't want to mess with Trump.
[00:58:47.442 --> 00:58:49.043]  And he wants peace.
[00:58:50.044 --> 00:58:54.648]  But he likes to go right up to the edge of war to then elicit that peace.
[00:58:54.748 --> 00:58:55.409]  Is that good?
[00:58:56.169 --> 00:58:56.730]  We're going to see.
[00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:00.412]  I just want to see action on the attack on the First Amendment.
[00:59:00.432 --> 00:59:04.454]  I want to see the cartels gone after, big media cartels that are trying to censor people.
[00:59:05.135 --> 00:59:06.656]  I want to see Trump get control of his government.
[00:59:06.716 --> 00:59:09.998]  I want to see Trump fire the neocons and the never Trumpers, the Soros people.
[00:59:10.038 --> 00:59:10.939]  And he's starting to do that.
[00:59:10.959 --> 00:59:13.360]  I mean, he's starting to really become the president.
[00:59:13.821 --> 00:59:20.705]  Now, if he becomes the full president and gets his real presidential power and then starts going sideways, I will become an enemy of Trump.
[00:59:21.806 --> 00:59:23.848]  But right now,
[00:59:28.416 --> 00:59:29.777]  I feel like Trump just got stronger.
[00:59:30.958 --> 00:59:33.379]  And I'm just being completely honest about how I see it.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.481]  It doesn't mean it's a good thing.
[00:59:36.141 --> 00:59:37.622]  Doesn't mean it's not going to go bad.
[00:59:37.642 --> 00:59:39.323]  Doesn't mean we're not going to hear from you.
[00:59:40.484 --> 00:59:42.285]  Obviously, every caller is against this.
[00:59:42.625 --> 00:59:44.206]  I can see all of you are against it.
[00:59:44.466 --> 00:59:46.848]  And I'm here telling you that I understand why Trump did it.
[00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:49.550]  Because I don't just go with what's popular.
[00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:51.431]  I was against all those wars before.
[00:59:51.691 --> 00:59:52.372]  Totally against them.
[00:59:52.392 --> 00:59:54.293]  Because they were all based on false flags and stuff.
[00:59:55.234 --> 00:59:58.215]  Iran is trying to take over Iraq, and I get your point.
[00:59:58.515 --> 00:59:59.176]  Let them have it!
[01:00:04.418 --> 01:00:07.059]  So, that's what Trump tends to do.
[01:00:07.099 --> 01:00:08.720]  He bombs stuff and then pulls out.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.741]  How about we just pull out of Iraq, then?
[01:00:13.022 --> 01:00:14.542]  How about we petition the President to pull out?
[01:00:15.343 --> 01:00:17.304]  Okay, you made your point, you killed him, now let's get the hell out of there.
[01:00:17.324 --> 01:00:17.744]  How about that?
[01:00:18.044 --> 01:00:18.804]  What do you think, listeners?
[01:00:19.044 --> 01:00:20.385]  Cameron in Missouri, thanks for holding.
[01:00:20.745 --> 01:00:21.465]  You lived in Iran.
[01:00:21.505 --> 01:00:22.666]  You say, give us your take on this.
[01:00:24.236 --> 01:00:26.237]  Alex, what a pleasure to talk with you.
[01:00:26.257 --> 01:00:28.839]  You have been an inspiration.
[01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:48.568]  I kind of parked all of this to the side 20 some years ago until a friend of mine turned me over to you and you were talking about 9-11 and I thought I really took heart in your courage and I started doing a lot of my own research about it and I came to the same conclusions.
[01:00:49.376 --> 01:00:53.240]  My dad worked in the Iranian government years ago, and my mom.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:01:02.248]  They both worked in the SAVAK, which was basically created by the CIA, to basically Iran's CIA, to keep it simple.
[01:01:03.189 --> 01:01:08.834]  And they used to cross-train with the Israeli Mossad from time to time, you know, when they would come to Iran.
[01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.136]  They were famous torturers.
[01:01:10.196 --> 01:01:14.680]  So you're saying your mother and father both worked in the Iranian secret police of the Shah?
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.641]  Yes, but in the counterintelligence, they had nothing to do with the torture.
[01:01:18.661 --> 01:01:21.902]  Sure, they weren't in the torture, they were out doing, uh, countering foreign intelligence.
[01:01:22.583 --> 01:01:23.003]  Correct.
[01:01:23.423 --> 01:01:23.763]  Correct.
[01:01:24.703 --> 01:01:35.227]  And, so, of course, my dad later left the Sovok, very much like in the U.S., you leave CIA, you go into other departments, and he went into the Prime Minister's.
[01:01:38.341 --> 01:01:38.862]  Yeah.
[01:01:56.028 --> 01:02:05.210]  And really, since then, I've seen basically the same policy that, you know, the New World Order is totally propping up the Ayatollahs.
[01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:07.130]  They're very easy to get rid of.
[01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.071]  They're having us here debate and chase our own tails.
[01:02:10.171 --> 01:02:13.151]  But this regime can fall very quickly.
[01:02:14.432 --> 01:02:16.772]  Just as they got rid of the Shah, I think the U.S.
[01:02:19.273 --> 01:02:21.353]  owes the Iranian people.
[01:02:23.048 --> 01:02:27.332]  Basically a payback to the Ayatollahs because they brought him in and I think the U.S.
[01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:29.053]  needs to help the Iranian people.
[01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:30.114]  Just empower them.
[01:02:30.174 --> 01:02:31.575]  Like, harm them.
[01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:35.017]  Well, that's why we're trying to support the Restart Movement.
[01:02:35.037 --> 01:02:35.978]  What do you think about that group?
[01:02:36.508 --> 01:02:38.449]  Well, I mean, yeah, that's good.
[01:02:38.509 --> 01:02:42.432]  I'm not, you know, I don't think no one group is going to... No, I agree.
[01:02:42.452 --> 01:02:51.037]  You're just saying... And listen, I totally agree with you that from what I knew, I mean, Iran had its problems, but it was a really nice technological place until the Islamists took over.
[01:02:51.057 --> 01:02:57.221]  And people don't know that it's admitted that elements of the CIA put the Ayatollahs in, then they double-crossed each other.
[01:02:57.301 --> 01:02:58.141]  It's just been a mess.
[01:02:58.521 --> 01:03:04.325]  And that's why Bolton keeps saying he wants to get rid of Iran, because the truth is the neocons are making money with them and working with the mullahs.
[01:03:05.568 --> 01:03:06.468]  Neocons, yes.
[01:03:06.728 --> 01:03:13.810]  Well, the whole New World Order, the George Soros group, they're all making money behind the scenes, and they want us to believe that they're the great devil.
[01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:18.670]  The Iranian government is a bad actor, and they really must go.
[01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:30.972]  And people have to remember, Iranians, just like in Israel, they are all required to do two years of military, and all we need to do is to arm the Iranian young people who've been in the military, have the Green Beret.
[01:03:30.992 --> 01:03:33.893]  They're trained to do this kind of guerrilla warfare, and just
[01:03:34.193 --> 01:03:35.154]  No, you're right, you're right.
[01:03:35.254 --> 01:03:38.577]  I mean, we could easily just kill all the leadership in their bunkers.
[01:03:39.078 --> 01:03:41.720]  But I mean, the problem is it'll look like we're invading.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:47.966]  And from the numbers I've seen, Iran's one of the youngest countries in the world, huge population under 30.
[01:03:48.987 --> 01:03:51.009]  I mean, the problem is we've tried to send people in there.
[01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:53.391]  They all get killed because they've got such a spy network.
[01:03:53.451 --> 01:03:55.593]  I mean, how would you propose overthrowing the dictatorship?
[01:03:56.438 --> 01:03:59.180]  Alex, a no-fly zone like we did with the Kurds.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:12.890]  Okay, just stop all air traffic over Iran, stop all trade, stop it, stop, shut down everything and let the people, arm the people, send the Green Berets in, arm the people in groups and they will get rid of this government.
[01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.091]  They got rid of the Shah in two days.
[01:04:15.111 --> 01:04:17.053]  I was there when the revolution happened.
[01:04:17.173 --> 01:04:18.033]  I was 14 years old.
[01:04:19.094 --> 01:04:25.559]  They just attacked the military bases, took the guns from the soldiers who didn't want to shoot at them because soldiers don't want to kill their own people.
[01:04:26.909 --> 01:04:33.301]  You're right, and a lot of numbers show attacking Iran once we got rid of their leadership would actually dig the mullahs in deeper.
[01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:37.082]  And it'll unite the Iranian people against America.
[01:04:37.282 --> 01:04:44.505]  The public opinion will be against, and Iran is no Syria or... Sir, let us get your name and number in case we do an Iran special, please, if you'd like to be a guest.
[01:04:44.545 --> 01:04:44.886]  Thank you.
[01:04:45.486 --> 01:04:46.046]  Great points.
[01:04:46.106 --> 01:04:47.347]  Thank you, Cameron.
[01:04:47.887 --> 01:04:48.207]  All right.
[01:04:48.987 --> 01:04:50.028]  More incredible calls.
[01:04:50.048 --> 01:04:51.308]  We've got the best calls out there.
[01:04:51.548 --> 01:04:55.330]  When we come back after this quick break, whatever you do, I cannot say it.
[01:04:55.430 --> 01:05:00.592]  It's so paramount when you spread the live links and tell folks about local stations, that overrides the censors.
[01:05:00.652 --> 01:05:01.833]  So do it, please.
[01:05:03.519 --> 01:05:06.060]  All right, let's go to Monroe in Florida.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.541]  Says they agree with Trump's decision.
[01:05:09.561 --> 01:05:12.662]  I mean, I think any way you slice this, the world's in crisis.
[01:05:12.682 --> 01:05:14.182]  There really is no good decision here.
[01:05:15.503 --> 01:05:17.423]  But I'm just saying I know why Trump did it.
[01:05:17.563 --> 01:05:18.483]  I understand why Trump did it.
[01:05:18.503 --> 01:05:19.884]  He's been very transparent about it.
[01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:27.354]  And Trump's done a lot more good than he's done bad, and this makes him stronger against the deep state.
[01:05:28.094 --> 01:05:31.976]  I still don't celebrate people being killed.
[01:05:32.577 --> 01:05:33.617]  What do you think, Monroe?
[01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:42.903]  Yeah, to anybody who is listening right now, whoever disagrees, they have that right to disagree with Trump's decision.
[01:05:44.545 --> 01:05:49.366]  We must remember that Trump knows way more than we do at this point in time, okay?
[01:05:49.426 --> 01:05:50.867]  Intelligence says so, right?
[01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:52.067]  Okay.
[01:05:52.207 --> 01:05:58.268]  So, another thing is, stalemate is linked to over 6,000 attacks against coalition forces in how many years?
[01:05:59.049 --> 01:06:07.671]  So, there's so much going on right now that we don't know about, and we are making these predetermined outcomes based on assumptions.
[01:06:08.351 --> 01:06:10.651]  We need to stay strong behind Trump.
[01:06:10.731 --> 01:06:12.032]  We cannot back down.
[01:06:12.092 --> 01:06:12.832]  We can't waver.
[01:06:13.482 --> 01:06:14.483]  We don't have a choice.
[01:06:14.663 --> 01:06:18.227]  We've been overrun for how many years in the United States by the Chi-Coms.
[01:06:18.247 --> 01:06:19.949]  We've been infiltrated left and right.
[01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:22.471]  We've been sold out left and right.
[01:06:22.872 --> 01:06:24.874]  We can't give in now, okay?
[01:06:25.634 --> 01:06:26.635]  We must stay strong.
[01:06:26.936 --> 01:06:28.978]  Alex, do you agree with that?
[01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:34.114]  I agree that Iran has been expanding and did attack our forces.
[01:06:34.214 --> 01:06:43.282]  I understand that we get into skirmishes with them as well, but they need to stop attacking the ships, the Strait of Hormuz, and most of the smart money thinks that Iran is going to back down.
[01:06:44.163 --> 01:06:45.164]  They may not back down.
[01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:48.166]  Somebody else could stage a false flag and say Iran did it.
[01:06:48.186 --> 01:06:49.468]  I think all cards are on the table.
[01:06:49.908 --> 01:06:53.872]  I believe Trump thought he did the best thing, but what you're getting at is I have a bunch of articles on this.
[01:06:55.066 --> 01:07:04.651]  The word is Iran was gearing up, and I've seen some evidence of this, to overthrow basically the Iraqi government and fully install themselves and expand their Islamic State.
[01:07:05.251 --> 01:07:09.353]  And so that's another reason that this was carried out and done.
[01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:09.894]  What do you think?
[01:07:11.054 --> 01:07:15.116]  Well, like I said before, there's so much more going on than we actually know.
[01:07:15.236 --> 01:07:21.339]  And, you know, the Iranians, these regime leaders, they're smart.
[01:07:21.639 --> 01:07:24.441]  They try to go for the psyche of the American
[01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.851]  They try to take advantage of our kindness, OK?
[01:07:29.391 --> 01:07:31.892]  And our good honor and our heart, OK?
[01:07:32.652 --> 01:07:38.434]  And these people, they don't live by the same codes of honor that we do, OK?
[01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:42.735]  So, like I said, psychology is a big play in this.
[01:07:42.915 --> 01:07:43.375]  We can't
[01:07:43.968 --> 01:07:49.312]  We can't just say, OK, look at this one issue and say he's made a bad decision.
[01:07:49.812 --> 01:07:52.294]  Now, you know, should I vote for him?
[01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:53.595]  Should I not vote for him?
[01:07:53.995 --> 01:07:59.659]  We cannot waver because there's so much he cannot tell us that Intel can't tell us.
[01:07:59.699 --> 01:08:06.003]  There's so much going on that if we did know everything that's going on, we would say, oh, I completely understand.
[01:08:06.556 --> 01:08:08.257]  We need to have trust and faith.
[01:08:08.758 --> 01:08:18.625]  God, I personally believe that God has chosen Trump to be the President of the United States, and he will lead us down these dark paths, but soon to come, there will be light.
[01:08:18.745 --> 01:08:19.786]  I personally believe that.
[01:08:20.387 --> 01:08:21.688]  Well, Monroe, I know this.
[01:08:22.188 --> 01:08:30.194]  The deep state's been working with Iran against Trump, and trying to make him look weak, trying to destabilize things, probing against the United States.
[01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:32.696]  So, this definitely has the deep state freaked out right now.
[01:08:32.736 --> 01:08:33.417]  I appreciate your call.
[01:08:35.683 --> 01:08:42.827]  It's still a very dangerous escalation, and it does show, wow, what else has Trump been shown to make him do something like this, because this is a big deal.
[01:08:43.267 --> 01:08:45.248]  Let's go to Texas now and talk to Richard.
[01:08:45.668 --> 01:08:46.549]  Richard, thanks for calling.
[01:08:47.989 --> 01:08:48.890]  Hey Alex.
[01:08:50.111 --> 01:08:58.695]  So, normally I disagree with some points of your analysis on these complex issues, but I really think what you've said has been accurate so far.
[01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.436]  The only thing I wanted to highlight in addition is
[01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:09.373]  The fact that the Green Zone is the most fortified embassy anywhere in the world from any nation.
[01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:12.734]  It's literally a heavily armed military base.
[01:09:13.474 --> 01:09:26.677]  So for the attack to get through the embassy, either a private military contractor working with leftists in the CIA or the CIA itself had to have authorized the attack and made a way for the forces to get through.
[01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:28.917]  I mean, there's just no possible way.
[01:09:28.937 --> 01:09:31.738]  Well, let's pull back and talk about that because I think you're right in one way.
[01:09:32.594 --> 01:09:39.357]  The Iraqi military was the first ring, and they stood down.
[01:09:40.317 --> 01:09:45.560]  And then, which happens a lot in wars, SOC was the company.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:50.522]  They were ordered to not shoot the demonstrators because they didn't want it to look like a
[01:09:50.862 --> 01:09:53.003]  You know, an authoritarian move by the United States.
[01:09:53.584 --> 01:10:14.977]  Instead it was done, not as a false flag, but as a type of false flag to let them attack, to then let them capture part of the base, have the seal of the U.S., to instead of making it a propaganda victory for Iran, if a bunch of people got mowed down, instead it made them look bad, which again shows they were working with the deep state, CNN, ABC News, they all have the same headline.
[01:10:15.618 --> 01:10:17.099]  Protestors take over!
[01:10:17.999 --> 01:10:23.501]  And even the New York Times is writing obituaries and saying how great this general is.
[01:10:23.561 --> 01:10:26.482]  So you can see the coordination to embarrass Trump.
[01:10:27.643 --> 01:10:30.484]  And so I was saying, hey, they have a right to shoot these people coming to the embassy.
[01:10:30.984 --> 01:10:35.486]  But now I see that I think Trump had probably already ordered the ambassador.
[01:10:36.186 --> 01:10:38.647]  They knew this was coming, and so they let them do it.
[01:10:40.427 --> 01:10:41.148]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:41.328 --> 01:10:44.749]  And I think your analysis that
[01:10:45.242 --> 01:11:05.887]  He made the best with a bad choice is accurate in that the neocons in the CIA wanted a war, so they made a little pact with their leftist friends in the CIA that they could have a Benghazi situation, but either way, the Deep State wins, and then Trump comes out of left field, he's like, I'll just kill their leaders!
[01:11:06.547 --> 01:11:13.569]  So he totally ran a psyop on the Deep State and won, and projected American power, boosted
[01:11:13.809 --> 01:11:21.298]  In fact, Richard, I'm so glad you called, because right before I went live, I even wrote notes, I was gonna say this, that if people think there's 3D chess, you just saw it from Trump.
[01:11:21.358 --> 01:11:23.901]  This smells of Trump, it's him, I get chills.
[01:11:23.981 --> 01:11:32.291]  I mean, listen, let's not start you-know-what-and-yet like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, but right now it looks like a masterstroke by Trump, just saying.
[01:11:33.464 --> 01:11:34.385]  Yeah, I agree 100%.
[01:11:34.545 --> 01:11:35.466]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:11:35.486 --> 01:11:36.647]  Well, look, let me ask you this, though.
[01:11:36.747 --> 01:11:38.448]  How do you think Iran counterstrikes?
[01:11:38.849 --> 01:11:47.076]  And how do the neocons in Deep State that clearly had the media lined up to make Trump look like Jimmy Carter in 1979, that didn't go the way they wanted it to?
[01:11:47.176 --> 01:11:48.397]  So what do you think they pull next?
[01:11:49.608 --> 01:11:51.649]  Well, I think it's impossible to tell.
[01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:58.073]  I think it'll develop over the next week, but it was such an unexpected move from a U.S.
[01:11:58.153 --> 01:11:58.613]  president.
[01:11:58.693 --> 01:12:02.575]  I think they're really going to have to have some meetings and figure out.
[01:12:03.135 --> 01:12:11.540]  I really don't think they anticipated this move, so I think we're just going to have to watch the situation closely, and we'll get some hints probably fairly quickly here.
[01:12:12.879 --> 01:12:13.239]  I agree.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.260]  Thank you very much, Richard.
[01:12:14.541 --> 01:12:17.964]  One thing's for sure, 2020 is going to be amazing.
[01:12:18.264 --> 01:12:20.867]  I mean, in I think every way.
[01:12:21.467 --> 01:12:31.697]  And just mythically, the iconography, just the numbers alone, it's going to be incredible.
[01:12:32.137 --> 01:12:32.718]  It already is.
[01:12:33.138 --> 01:12:34.940]  Let's go ahead now and take another call here.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:37.302]  Let's talk to Jeff in Louisiana.
[01:12:37.322 --> 01:12:37.822]  Thanks for holding.
[01:12:37.842 --> 01:12:38.303]  Jeff, go ahead.
[01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:41.019]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:12:41.119 --> 01:12:41.520]  Good, brother.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:51.649]  Louisiana here, long-time listener, long-time follower, been following you probably for 10 years, and it's an absolute pleasure and honor to be able to speak to you and your listeners.
[01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:54.232]  I want to talk about two things real quick with you guys.
[01:12:55.293 --> 01:13:00.638]  First one about the attack on the general, the Iranian general, and then the second one, a couple suggestions for your operation.
[01:13:00.658 --> 01:13:01.719]  I had a couple good ideas.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.321]  First off, with Iran,
[01:13:04.142 --> 01:13:06.665]  We need to treat Iran like a bee's nest.
[01:13:07.026 --> 01:13:08.968]  What do you do with a bee's nest in your yard?
[01:13:09.308 --> 01:13:10.330]  You have two options.
[01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:19.501]  Either stay away from it or wait until the evening comes, let every bee come home to nest and then spray it, kill every single one and destroy the nest.
[01:13:20.042 --> 01:13:21.063]  These Iranians
[01:13:21.923 --> 01:13:27.245]  They literally believe that it's up to them to bring the apocalypse and the end of the world.
[01:13:27.325 --> 01:13:28.746]  And if they can do this, they win.
[01:13:29.066 --> 01:13:33.107]  They believe that the 12th imam is just going to show up in Iran and save them all.
[01:13:33.447 --> 01:13:37.109]  So they're willing to sacrifice every single man, woman, and child.
[01:13:37.489 --> 01:13:39.069]  And this is exactly what they want.
[01:13:39.349 --> 01:13:39.930]  Well, that's right.
[01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:42.290]  That's why the Ayatollah is congratulating.
[01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:43.411]  I'm going to play the clip coming up.
[01:13:43.811 --> 01:13:46.492]  He's congratulating the families how great it is that they're dead.
[01:13:47.472 --> 01:13:48.253]  Yes, exactly.
[01:13:49.234 --> 01:13:54.518]  As Americans and as Christians, are we really willing to go to war with 80 million people?
[01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:57.501]  Are we really willing to kill 80 million people?
[01:13:57.841 --> 01:13:58.802]  I've worked overseas.
[01:13:58.982 --> 01:14:00.824]  I've worked stateside for the federal government.
[01:14:01.264 --> 01:14:04.347]  All I saw was corruption and stupidity.
[01:14:04.707 --> 01:14:07.289]  And all we're doing is doubling down on stupidity.
[01:14:07.549 --> 01:14:10.352]  We have not had any luck with interfering, whether in central
[01:14:10.692 --> 01:14:11.273]  No, I hear you.
[01:14:11.353 --> 01:14:16.858]  I mean, we are very soft and domesticated, at least most of the public, and then we're about to go to war with psychotic piranhas.
[01:14:16.878 --> 01:14:17.559]  Stay there.
[01:14:17.599 --> 01:14:19.400]  I want you to be able to finish your point, Jeff.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.782]  We'll be right back.
[01:14:22.243 --> 01:14:26.907]  2000 seems like five minutes ago, but also a thousand years ago, and now it's 2020.
[01:14:28.068 --> 01:14:28.308]  Wow.
[01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:33.433]  And I haven't spent a lot of time on this, but I really need to.
[01:14:34.294 --> 01:14:36.296]  I may come into a special report tomorrow just on it.
[01:14:39.312 --> 01:14:44.375]  They put me on every news channel and every newspaper in the country.
[01:14:44.435 --> 01:14:45.335]  I've randomly checked it.
[01:14:47.456 --> 01:14:50.338]  Okay, you understand, only the deep state CIA can do that.
[01:14:51.478 --> 01:14:53.599]  Trump still doesn't have damn control of it.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.000]  The same group attacks him constantly.
[01:14:57.621 --> 01:14:58.802]  And you're like, well, why can't he stop?
[01:14:58.842 --> 01:14:59.362]  He's the president.
[01:14:59.382 --> 01:14:59.962]  He's ordered it.
[01:15:00.002 --> 01:15:00.723]  They just won't quit.
[01:15:00.743 --> 01:15:01.863]  It's crazy.
[01:15:03.424 --> 01:15:07.846]  They had me on from 9 at night until about 2 a.m.
[01:15:09.349 --> 01:15:16.731]  While the ball dropped, they had scrolls saying Alex Jones found guilty of lying about Sandy Hook parents.
[01:15:16.771 --> 01:15:17.551]  That's not even true.
[01:15:19.551 --> 01:15:24.052]  It was just some attorney's fees thing, because the judge said we didn't answer the questions like we're supposed to.
[01:15:24.092 --> 01:15:25.092]  That's not accurate either.
[01:15:25.112 --> 01:15:27.413]  They were like, what is your source of this CNN video?
[01:15:27.813 --> 01:15:28.493]  Well, it's CNN.
[01:15:28.793 --> 01:15:29.553]  Who is the source?
[01:15:29.593 --> 01:15:30.233]  Who gave it to you?
[01:15:30.473 --> 01:15:31.394]  Oh, you didn't tell us.
[01:15:31.674 --> 01:15:31.954]  Oh, it's $68,000 and $37,000.
[01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:32.474]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:32.754]  It's evil.
[01:15:40.456 --> 01:15:44.058]  That turns into Jones is guilty of the Sandy Hook.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.421]  Why would they do that?
[01:15:47.661 --> 01:15:53.765]  Why would they take an 11-day-old ruling that had been in the local paper that meant nothing?
[01:15:53.785 --> 01:16:01.590]  It was the last year of this judge, you know, just attacking us, in my view.
[01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.733]  And the lawyers I know, they've never seen anything like it.
[01:16:05.753 --> 01:16:06.333]  They go, this is insane.
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:20.329]  I mean, imagine a deposition, they ask you a question and you don't know, because the statute of limitations is like two years, they're asking about seven-year-old videos, just like, we don't know, it's a video we edited years ago, we don't know.
[01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:21.990]  You don't have the source of that?
[01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:25.172]  This is, you have violated the court order!
[01:16:25.273 --> 01:16:25.172]  $63,000, $37,000, $20,000!
[01:16:25.333 --> 01:16:29.236]  In the rage to destroy the First Amendment, in their Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:16:41.647 --> 01:16:42.708]  But that isn't the issue.
[01:16:43.008 --> 01:16:44.108]  Yes, I'm persecuted.
[01:16:45.049 --> 01:16:47.250]  Yes, they pay people to tell outrageous lies about me.
[01:16:49.111 --> 01:16:49.651]  But why?
[01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:52.692]  We're gonna go back to your calls, amazing calls.
[01:16:52.832 --> 01:16:59.576]  It's because, folks, we really know what we're talking about.
[01:17:00.976 --> 01:17:02.057]  And you know who knows who we're talking about?
[01:17:02.097 --> 01:17:03.318]  And it's not a butt-kissing thing.
[01:17:04.198 --> 01:17:07.980]  Anybody that listened in the last hour to these calls, it's like these, they're phenomenal.
[01:17:09.335 --> 01:17:11.397]  Nobody in talk radio has callers like this.
[01:17:11.457 --> 01:17:12.958]  CNN can't get any good callers.
[01:17:13.158 --> 01:17:15.881]  My callers are better than Fox News' best guests.
[01:17:16.181 --> 01:17:17.482]  We've really got the thinkers.
[01:17:17.802 --> 01:17:18.823]  We've got the best guests.
[01:17:19.003 --> 01:17:19.964]  We've got the best crew.
[01:17:20.144 --> 01:17:20.725]  We're real!
[01:17:22.606 --> 01:17:26.750]  Number one podcast, 2017 Joe Rogan.
[01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:31.554]  Number one podcast, 2019 Joe Rogan, which was the number one ever in all time.
[01:17:32.955 --> 01:17:33.656]  That's in the news.
[01:17:34.357 --> 01:17:35.498]  Why wasn't I number one in 2018?
[01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:36.899]  He didn't have me on.
[01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:47.608]  Not bragging, I'm saying people love freedom and even my obnoxious loudmouth Texan ass.
[01:17:48.448 --> 01:17:49.509]  Because I'm real.
[01:17:49.789 --> 01:17:52.611]  And the obnoxiousness in all of it is endearing.
[01:17:52.711 --> 01:17:55.853]  I know, just like your obnoxiousness is endearing.
[01:17:55.873 --> 01:17:56.794]  Because you know what?
[01:17:56.914 --> 01:17:57.975]  It's real, folks.
[01:17:58.055 --> 01:17:59.136]  There's nothing fake here.
[01:17:59.156 --> 01:18:02.218]  In fact, I'm so damn real I can't stand it.
[01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:03.598]  I sometimes want to control myself.
[01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:05.300]  I sometimes want to act a different way.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:06.220]  I sometimes... I can't!
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.201]  I can't control myself!
[01:18:08.789 --> 01:18:09.530]  I'm a maniac!
[01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:10.231]  It's all real!
[01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:11.132]  I'm totally real!
[01:18:11.712 --> 01:18:12.653]  I've never lied to you!
[01:18:12.673 --> 01:18:15.897]  I compulsively tell the truth!
[01:18:17.899 --> 01:18:21.103]  And these people out there, they can't stand that, you see.
[01:18:21.303 --> 01:18:23.025]  And they also don't like the fact they can't scare me.
[01:18:23.245 --> 01:18:24.547]  And they don't like the fact they can't scare you.
[01:18:24.587 --> 01:18:25.167]  But let me just tell you.
[01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:29.472]  I've studied war propaganda and how the globalists do stuff.
[01:18:29.852 --> 01:18:30.113]  Folks.
[01:18:33.098 --> 01:18:52.587]  I think they're probably, I need to go to your calls, but I need to probably do a special report so I don't cut into the main broadcast time of your calls, but I think they're getting ready to do a false flag and blame me and they might kill me, and I'm only, it's not sad to be dramatic, and if that happens, I'm not a loser, I'm a winner, I don't want to die by the way, I'm not going to commit suicide, but you know what I mean.
[01:18:53.468 --> 01:18:55.669]  They don't do that unless they got something big planned.
[01:18:56.729 --> 01:19:00.931]  Let me tell you something, I was on every news station in the country.
[01:19:01.651 --> 01:19:02.652]  I checked randomly.
[01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:04.313]  Hundreds.
[01:19:05.334 --> 01:19:05.714]  Last night.
[01:19:05.734 --> 01:19:08.455]  You know what that means?
[01:19:09.676 --> 01:19:17.600]  That means the folks running the show that are fighting Trump, we're talking CIA, the highest level, Brennan and those folks, they've got a plan.
[01:19:19.001 --> 01:19:23.144]  And they're assassinating my character and my name ahead of trying to kill me.
[01:19:23.684 --> 01:19:30.768]  Now, Dr. Pachinik used to be involved in assassinations and regime change, and he's not doing it as a studly tough guy or anything, he'd call it a medical necessity or whatever.
[01:19:31.673 --> 01:19:35.055]  Unless you find a lot of assassinations and stuff at high level, they actually use doctors for it.
[01:19:35.796 --> 01:19:38.397]  He's a psychiatrist, he had a lot of other things, but he's gonna be joining us.
[01:19:38.417 --> 01:19:50.826]  We'll take your calls as well, but I'm gonna pick his brain about myself, but not, not from a selfishness point of view, but for everybody, like, I'm not that important, okay?
[01:19:51.666 --> 01:20:00.292]  That every newspaper that's in this, these networks, because they get an order, it comes in, and it's like, hey, push this, and they do it.
[01:20:03.135 --> 01:20:05.136]  And they did that to us again.
[01:20:05.237 --> 01:20:14.943]  I mean, so I'm not sure exactly what's going on, but they usually do that when they overthrow your government or they assassinate you.
[01:20:16.464 --> 01:20:21.067]  And so I'm just proud of the work we've done to get under this much attack.
[01:20:21.087 --> 01:20:22.569]  I mean, I got to be honest with you.
[01:20:22.989 --> 01:20:23.889]  It's not a pride thing.
[01:20:23.949 --> 01:20:27.832]  It's a satisfaction thing of a job well done that, wow, I really counted for something, man.
[01:20:29.537 --> 01:20:31.978]  I did a decent job, and our listeners boosted our transmission.
[01:20:32.038 --> 01:20:32.718]  You did this, too.
[01:20:33.298 --> 01:20:37.280]  So if they do kill me or whatever, you know, just keep the mission going on, and I'm not a loser.
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:40.541]  They don't win by killing me or whatever it is they got planned, but it's bad.
[01:20:41.181 --> 01:20:45.062]  So on the New Year, I thought I'd just go ahead and tell you that, because I just got to tell you everything.
[01:20:45.883 --> 01:20:47.403]  And I'm not doing it to be dramatic, folks.
[01:20:47.483 --> 01:20:48.244]  It's real, OK?
[01:20:48.264 --> 01:20:50.584]  I mean, that's the wings of death flapping around.
[01:20:50.624 --> 01:20:51.365]  You can just hear them.
[01:20:52.045 --> 01:20:53.285]  And fine, whatever.
[01:20:55.595 --> 01:21:03.679]  Just don't let me see it coming, because I'm going to fight for my life, but it's just nothing to me, because I expected this a long time ago.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:10.503]  I told you I got on my knees a lot of times, and I said, I feel the evil, I see what it is, I want to defeat it, God, and I want people to wake up.
[01:21:11.224 --> 01:21:24.351]  And God literally told me, it was like, I've said this for 20 years, it's like, you're going to trigger the whole movement to take down the globalists, and you're going to inspire others to do it, and then you're going to be destroyed in the end, so you're sure you want that.
[01:21:25.476 --> 01:21:27.737]  And I mean, I said this 120 years ago.
[01:21:27.757 --> 01:21:29.797]  I mean, I've literally heard God's voice in my head.
[01:21:30.157 --> 01:21:31.118]  And when those times, you know it.
[01:21:31.178 --> 01:21:32.998]  I mean, it's like, okay, you want this?
[01:21:33.078 --> 01:21:37.359]  Because you're going to get really torn to pieces at the end of it, but it's going to be really good.
[01:21:37.899 --> 01:21:39.700]  And I'm so, I don't know if this is the end of it.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.441]  I don't know if that's what this is or whatever it is, but you know what?
[01:21:42.881 --> 01:21:44.801]  Hey, I asked for it and I actually like it.
[01:21:45.922 --> 01:21:51.043]  I just have selfishly, because I never pray and ask God for things other than take care of my family and my children.
[01:21:51.063 --> 01:21:52.984]  And God's done that.
[01:21:53.364 --> 01:21:53.944]  God's done that.
[01:21:55.481 --> 01:21:59.304]  And that's really all that matters, but you know, and I've also given my children to God.
[01:21:59.324 --> 01:22:02.407]  Because you can't let them, you know, control you about being able to get to your children.
[01:22:02.767 --> 01:22:06.851]  So I just turned my children over to God and God's protecting them, but they can't get to me through my children either.
[01:22:06.931 --> 01:22:07.711]  I'm totally committed.
[01:22:08.032 --> 01:22:09.333]  They can put a gun to my head, anything.
[01:22:09.373 --> 01:22:10.093]  I'm never stopping.
[01:22:10.474 --> 01:22:11.334]  I'm never giving up.
[01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:12.215]  I'm never giving in.
[01:22:12.255 --> 01:22:13.096]  I'm never backing down.
[01:22:13.116 --> 01:22:14.377]  I'm never submitting to them.
[01:22:15.858 --> 01:22:19.821]  And they're in a battle to kill my name because they see it as an image of Americana and freedom.
[01:22:19.841 --> 01:22:22.624]  And they think if they can destroy Alex Jones, they can destroy anybody.
[01:22:23.404 --> 01:22:25.366]  Because they know you're backing me.
[01:22:26.047 --> 01:22:34.715]  And they know, they think if we can get this guy, and capture who he is, and use him as a straw man, and use a symbol of freedom as a symbol of evil and corruption, then we win.
[01:22:34.735 --> 01:22:35.296]  Well you know what?
[01:22:35.376 --> 01:22:38.799]  As long as you tell the truth, and as long as you spread the word, they fail!
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:42.881]  And as long as you don't buy their stories that I'm a loser and that I'm a failure.
[01:22:42.921 --> 01:22:43.602]  That's all that is.
[01:22:43.902 --> 01:22:44.962]  Jones is a failure.
[01:22:45.442 --> 01:22:46.363]  Jones is a failure.
[01:22:46.423 --> 01:22:47.363]  He's a failure.
[01:22:47.383 --> 01:22:48.104]  He hurts kids.
[01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:49.624]  That's a bunch of bullets.
[01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.345]  The Democrats want to kill kids in the womb.
[01:22:51.565 --> 01:22:53.166]  They want to kill kids outside the womb.
[01:22:53.646 --> 01:22:55.086]  They want to disease everybody.
[01:22:55.106 --> 01:22:56.507]  They want to sterilize little kids.
[01:22:56.907 --> 01:23:02.169]  Everybody knows who wants all the fake phony wars and all the Islamification and all the garbage.
[01:23:02.249 --> 01:23:02.870]  It's the left.
[01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:04.110]  It's not me.
[01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:05.551]  I'm not a bully.
[01:23:05.631 --> 01:23:06.531]  I didn't hurt kids.
[01:23:06.811 --> 01:23:08.232]  I just don't believe official stories.
[01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:12.599]  Especially when people that have been high up in the CIA tell me it's completely fake.
[01:23:13.379 --> 01:23:14.139]  But, whatever.
[01:23:14.459 --> 01:23:15.820]  That's not the hill I'm going to die on.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.241]  We'll go to some of your calls, and we're going to get Steve Pchenik on and get his take.
[01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.601]  We'll continue with calls while he's with us.
[01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:29.183]  I've gotten a lot of calls so far, but I'm going to finish up with Jeff, then I'm going to go to Tarif next, and then I'm going to go to everybody in the order from which you called.
[01:23:29.583 --> 01:23:30.183]  Justin, everybody.
[01:23:30.203 --> 01:23:33.344]  We're going to get to everybody today, and I'm going to go ahead and host into the fourth hour.
[01:23:34.324 --> 01:23:35.725]  Syrian girl's gonna join us as well.
[01:23:36.125 --> 01:23:40.548]  Owen Schroyer's gonna be interviewing Dr. Pachinik again for even longer today on his show, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:23:40.568 --> 01:23:42.088]  But he's gonna pop in, I wanna get his take.
[01:23:42.869 --> 01:23:46.411]  And I'll just say what Rebecca said, she's a smart lady, and I said, what's your take on this?
[01:23:46.451 --> 01:23:49.753]  She said, I don't like sending 4,000 more troops to the Middle East.
[01:23:50.768 --> 01:23:51.948]  Trump said he'd get troops out.
[01:23:52.949 --> 01:23:57.570]  It's one thing to kill the Iranian general, but he needs to not escalate troops.
[01:23:57.830 --> 01:24:00.151]  And I think that is absolutely right.
[01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:02.991]  And that's why I go around asking people, what do you think?
[01:24:03.031 --> 01:24:03.452]  What do you think?
[01:24:03.912 --> 01:24:09.093]  Because the knowledge of the crowd, the knowledge of the people, is really where you find it.
[01:24:09.413 --> 01:24:10.274]  When they are awake.
[01:24:10.474 --> 01:24:11.434]  Awake people are amazing.
[01:24:11.474 --> 01:24:12.234]  Listen to these callers.
[01:24:13.074 --> 01:24:15.355]  Then you try to talk to a leftist, they don't even know what planet they're on.
[01:24:15.775 --> 01:24:18.576]  We shouldn't be laughing at that, even though I laugh myself.
[01:24:19.411 --> 01:24:21.952]  Because I'm so uneasy about it, because those people are dangerous.
[01:24:22.552 --> 01:24:23.813]  So how the hell do we get through to them?
[01:24:24.073 --> 01:24:34.077]  All right, third hour, your call, Dr. Steve Pucinich, Syrian girl, Owen Schroyer, right into the fourth hour, and then the last 30 minutes will be hosted by Dr. Nick Begich.
[01:24:35.118 --> 01:24:38.279]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.501]  Now into the third hour, taking phone calls.
[01:24:42.581 --> 01:24:44.022]  Jeff in Louisiana is a holdover.
[01:24:44.422 --> 01:24:48.624]  He made a point, he's going to finish his point, he said Iran's like a beehive in your yard.
[01:24:49.298 --> 01:24:59.666]  Either stay away from it or wait till they go to bed at night and do what I do and go with a squirt gun, spray some gasoline in it and light it on fire if it isn't too dry outside.
[01:25:00.187 --> 01:25:02.449]  That's the best way to get rid of them instead of just letting them, you know.
[01:25:02.549 --> 01:25:05.011]  Sometimes the bead poison doesn't even kill them all and they come back.
[01:25:05.731 --> 01:25:06.432]  So that's what I do.
[01:25:06.492 --> 01:25:07.332]  I use gasoline.
[01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:10.875]  I'm not going to tell a bee story.
[01:25:10.935 --> 01:25:14.999]  I just... Anyways, I'm going to stop right there.
[01:25:15.519 --> 01:25:17.361]  Let's just say somebody in my family had bees.
[01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:20.909]  They didn't like me and for whatever reason would attack me when I went to their house.
[01:25:20.969 --> 01:25:23.070]  I mean, I'd be 50 yards away and the damn things would attack.
[01:25:23.670 --> 01:25:27.953]  So I snuck over and dealt with the bees, but my parents listen, I shouldn't tell the story.
[01:25:29.894 --> 01:25:33.056]  Anyways, uh, what was the end of your analogy, Jeff?
[01:25:34.097 --> 01:25:43.023]  Oh, what I was going to, like I said, you know, these people, they really believe that it's their job to bring upon the apocalypse and the end of the world.
[01:25:43.503 --> 01:25:46.205]  You can't fight against that sort of crazy mindset.
[01:25:46.937 --> 01:25:47.998]  And what is the endgame?
[01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:55.447]  Does anybody really think that if we just kill some generals and kill some leaders, the people within the country will just change their opinion?
[01:25:55.548 --> 01:25:56.008]  No, they won't.
[01:25:56.288 --> 01:25:57.230]  There's 79, 80 million people in Iran.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:01.861]  They all will fight to the death.
[01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:03.321]  Well listen, let's, hold on.
[01:26:03.961 --> 01:26:13.805]  I think the core controlling religious cult will, and because we stand for nothing now, it makes us very easy to defeat, I agree with you, that their military is formidable, their professionals are very dangerous.
[01:26:14.265 --> 01:26:25.409]  But you know, half their population is under 30, and they've done internal polls, something like 70% of those wildly love America, and do not, I mean, do not want to be under it.
[01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:30.391]  ...and kill these people who don't have anything against us?
[01:26:30.591 --> 01:26:43.418]  Because once we go in there and start killing people like we did in Syria, trying to pick who's good and who's moderate and who's bad... Well, no, that's the reason the Russians were able to go into Syria and win when nobody else could, because they're going there, and they tell you, evacuate the town, and if you don't, they kill you.
[01:26:44.038 --> 01:26:45.199]  And that's what you do in a war.
[01:26:45.239 --> 01:26:47.040]  I mean, in World War II, we bombed whole cities.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.241]  I'm not saying that's a good thing, but that's how you win wars.
[01:26:49.321 --> 01:26:49.681]  I hear you.
[01:26:50.261 --> 01:26:50.821]  Thank you, Jeff.
[01:26:50.861 --> 01:26:51.302]  Good points.
[01:26:51.322 --> 01:26:52.442]  All right, let's take another call here.
[01:26:52.502 --> 01:26:54.523]  Tarif, in Louisiana, thank you for holding.
[01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:55.284]  Really appreciate that.
[01:26:55.304 --> 01:26:55.744]  You're on the air.
[01:26:56.724 --> 01:27:02.869]  I've been trying to get in contact with y'all for some years now, and I want to talk about two things, Mr. Alex.
[01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:07.872]  I'm a whistleblower, I'm a VA whistleblower, and also anti-war.
[01:27:08.352 --> 01:27:12.175]  I'm pro-Trump, but also I can criticize Trump or whoever else.
[01:27:12.195 --> 01:27:12.656]  Yes, you can, absolutely.
[01:27:13.656 --> 01:27:14.937]  Yeah, so, okay.
[01:27:15.778 --> 01:27:17.719]  Trump was lied to, I feel to believe.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:24.084]  Once I saw what happened last night, I had this feeling, a strange feeling that came over me.
[01:27:24.628 --> 01:27:27.270]  I said, wow, they got him this time.
[01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:28.691]  Well, you got to go with your gut.
[01:27:28.731 --> 01:27:29.432]  It's always right.
[01:27:29.952 --> 01:27:31.874]  Yeah, so I say, OK, what happened?
[01:27:31.974 --> 01:27:36.037]  OK, so you had the contractor with what they're not telling you.
[01:27:36.097 --> 01:27:42.221]  The contractor was killed, but you had regular Iraqi military was killed as well.
[01:27:42.482 --> 01:27:44.763]  That was protecting the contractor or contractors.
[01:27:45.164 --> 01:27:50.348]  You had Iraqi police and some rumors that were circling on the Internet that you had some PMU.
[01:27:51.741 --> 01:27:53.983]  That was protecting them as well that was killed.
[01:27:54.324 --> 01:28:01.250]  It won't make sense for PMU to attack their own brothers and sisters, right?
[01:28:02.191 --> 01:28:15.343]  So, hey, you had 450 kilometers away on the Syrian-Iraqi border, the PMU unit that was fighting against ISIS, that was hit, all right?
[01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:19.891]  I don't think it was Shiite militia killing Shiite militia.
[01:28:19.911 --> 01:28:22.372]  I think it was another group that was doing it.
[01:28:22.392 --> 01:28:24.013]  I think it was a group that was
[01:28:41.044 --> 01:28:44.166]  Maybe ISIS-affiliated, being funded from outside.
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:28:58.740]  That's true.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:59.941]  They should have said something.
[01:29:00.321 --> 01:29:03.263]  And I don't like the fact how they surrounded our embassy.
[01:29:03.743 --> 01:29:04.163]  Hold on.
[01:29:04.243 --> 01:29:08.165]  I've got Dr. Steve Pachinick, who's worked for the CIA, State Department, everything, coming on.
[01:29:08.225 --> 01:29:08.966]  Always a great guest.
[01:29:08.986 --> 01:29:09.866]  We're going to take calls.
[01:29:10.006 --> 01:29:17.590]  I want to come back to you and have you ask your question or make your statement because, yeah, this is the season of false flags, if there ever was one.
[01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:20.432]  So we'll try to decipher this minefield on the other side.
[01:29:20.872 --> 01:29:22.113]  Newswars.com.
[01:29:22.993 --> 01:29:24.074]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:29:24.134 --> 01:29:26.395]  Only way that site gets out is when you share it.
[01:29:28.251 --> 01:29:33.434]  All right, riding shotgun with us for this hour is Dr. Steve Pachetnik.
[01:29:33.454 --> 01:29:35.095]  He's gonna be back on The War Room today.
[01:29:35.115 --> 01:29:37.697]  I really appreciate him giving us so much of his time in the new year.
[01:29:38.177 --> 01:29:39.518]  He really is an interesting character.
[01:29:39.558 --> 01:29:40.518]  His new memoir is out.
[01:29:40.658 --> 01:29:43.000]  I went and downloaded it last week and read it over Christmas.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.002]  And I know a lot of history and it's just amazing how many things this guy has been involved in.
[01:29:47.382 --> 01:29:49.103]  But that's really how it always is.
[01:29:49.123 --> 01:29:51.665]  There's certain people that are doers and people that aren't.
[01:29:52.265 --> 01:29:59.752]  And so people see all the stuff Infowars has done, and it's kind of ridiculous that we list it all, but we're in the game of direct action as U.S.
[01:29:59.792 --> 01:30:02.896]  citizens for freedom, peacefully, with information warfare.
[01:30:03.676 --> 01:30:06.899]  Just, you know, self-taught by the truth and history.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:13.166]  And Dr. Pucinich's worked, you know, all over the place, and with different agencies, and regime change, and you name it, he was involved.
[01:30:13.966 --> 01:30:15.347]  And a lot of missions that were successful.
[01:30:15.407 --> 01:30:17.748]  The only Camp David Accord, he ran that.
[01:30:17.788 --> 01:30:20.369]  He's on record as the psychologist that got that done.
[01:30:20.389 --> 01:30:21.610]  The only peace deal that ever worked.
[01:30:21.670 --> 01:30:23.971]  And he was also involved in missions that didn't go well.
[01:30:23.991 --> 01:30:27.312]  The Delta Force, the Yelp found, and the whole first mission was Jimmy Carter.
[01:30:27.813 --> 01:30:30.314]  And all the weird triple crosses going on there.
[01:30:30.394 --> 01:30:33.055]  So, I can't think of anybody better to come on.
[01:30:33.075 --> 01:30:34.876]  And I didn't pre-interview him.
[01:30:34.916 --> 01:30:37.197]  This morning, I said, hey, can you try to call and get him on?
[01:30:38.365 --> 01:30:42.048]  I didn't even go to StevePchenik.com, because I probably visit every few days, but I didn't even want to know.
[01:30:42.308 --> 01:30:55.499]  I just said, I want to get him on, I'll say what I think, I'll have callers, and then I love the randomness and the realness of getting him on, and then seeing through his lens what he thinks is happening.
[01:30:55.559 --> 01:30:57.100]  Is the sleeper cell threat real?
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:58.301]  Why do you think Trump did this?
[01:30:58.602 --> 01:30:59.603]  Was it the right thing to do?
[01:30:59.803 --> 01:31:00.723]  What's going to come out of it?
[01:31:00.984 --> 01:31:02.445]  How are the neocons going to respond?
[01:31:02.525 --> 01:31:04.246]  What does this do to the back channel?
[01:31:04.507 --> 01:31:05.948]  We know that Obama and Hillary
[01:31:06.448 --> 01:31:11.870]  And Kerry are still having, have they been doing things with Iran to embarrass Trump and the Pentagon?
[01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:13.710]  So those are all my questions.
[01:31:13.770 --> 01:31:16.611]  And then we have all these great callers that are going to bring up their own points on this.
[01:31:16.952 --> 01:31:18.832]  And we'll get Steve Pucinich's take on that.
[01:31:18.872 --> 01:31:24.794]  But when we go to your callers, now that we've got a guest on, I know you understand this, this quick question or comment, we'll get Pucinich's take on that.
[01:31:24.954 --> 01:31:29.576]  As well, his website is, of course, stevepucinich.com.
[01:31:30.436 --> 01:31:34.219]  And we also have, Owen's going to be popping in just with a few comments.
[01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:36.401]  We're going to have Syrian Girl popping in as well.
[01:31:36.421 --> 01:31:38.142]  I'm going to host Ian to the fourth hour.
[01:31:38.602 --> 01:31:39.903]  So thanks for joining us.
[01:31:39.963 --> 01:31:44.026]  Wow, 2020 is already off to a roaring, roaring start.
[01:31:44.367 --> 01:31:49.591]  Give us your prime approximation as a leading, I think, long-term expert on this.
[01:31:50.629 --> 01:32:05.822]  Well, as much as I've criticized the issues of going to war, and particularly 9-11, a lot of the problems that arose as a result of the Iran hostage siege, 9-11, really has come to fruition right now.
[01:32:06.283 --> 01:32:08.965]  I am for the assassination of Soleimani.
[01:32:09.225 --> 01:32:11.347]  I would have done it a little bit more elegantly.
[01:32:11.367 --> 01:32:13.409]  I would have done it quietly.
[01:32:13.429 --> 01:32:15.211]  I would have had more evidence.
[01:32:15.351 --> 01:32:16.392]  The reason for this
[01:32:17.302 --> 01:32:21.566]  It's far more complicated than anybody has realized in the news.
[01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:34.997]  Number one, for several weeks, my own people have been telling me that contrary to what the New York Times reported and the media reported, the riots in Iraq was not against the American embassy.
[01:32:35.377 --> 01:32:40.281]  It was against the Iranian leadership in Iraq that was totally corrupt.
[01:32:40.916 --> 01:33:01.306]  Now, you have to understand, I don't mean you, I mean in general, the American public has to understand that from the very beginning in 79, when I was involved, to say to Jimmy Carter personally, do not put in our embassy personnel in Iran or anywhere else and let the events
[01:33:03.866 --> 01:33:06.128]  Transpire without our intervention.
[01:33:06.568 --> 01:33:11.773]  We have had nothing but Iranian corruption underneath a Muslim leadership.
[01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:16.236]  Now, I say this with the ability to say, look, I've been in Iran.
[01:33:16.416 --> 01:33:17.817]  I was at Khomeini's house.
[01:33:18.438 --> 01:33:25.744]  I negotiated with Khomeini and Khomeini clearly told me about his son Khamenei, who wasn't very bright.
[01:33:26.084 --> 01:33:26.765]  And in turn,
[01:33:27.325 --> 01:33:38.975]  What happened is that Khamenei has had a power struggle with Soleimani, who came in to power and the head of the Revolutionary Guard over 20 years ago.
[01:33:39.296 --> 01:33:45.701]  And in turn, we were involved in another war, which we don't talk about, which we did initiate.
[01:33:45.741 --> 01:33:50.085]  And actually, one of our neocons, Zalmay Khalilzad, was instrumental in that.
[01:33:50.185 --> 01:33:54.149]  And that was the Iraq-Iran War, which we don't talk about.
[01:33:54.349 --> 01:34:09.182]  And I'm not going to interrupt you in a moment because I want you to be able to roll because you are a leading expert on this, but you're saying, my gut level visceral reaction is, right thing to do, lets the deep state know they're not going to play double deals with Iran against the U.S., is a message to North Korea on so many fronts, Trump made the right move.
[01:34:10.592 --> 01:34:25.105]  Absolutely, but more importantly it's a message to the children and the young people in Iran that we're with them and in fact that we're not only with them but we will help them to dispose of the leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
[01:34:25.505 --> 01:34:29.348]  The amount of corruption that has been there has been so serious.
[01:34:29.829 --> 01:34:34.353]  I didn't go on the air a couple of weeks ago but I had one of my videos where I said clearly
[01:34:34.913 --> 01:34:45.938]  Thousands of young men and women in Iran were killed by the IRG under the order of Soleimani and directly the order of Ayatollah Khamenei.
[01:34:46.018 --> 01:34:47.199]  He couldn't care less.
[01:34:47.839 --> 01:34:53.602]  Now, the most interesting element of this is when I was in Iran 10-15 years ago, I went to Qom.
[01:34:54.122 --> 01:34:54.422]  Thank you.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:21.302]  The Ayatollahs there said to me, this is not a legitimate government under Khomeini or Khamenei.
[01:35:21.602 --> 01:35:31.285]  And the reason for that is there was no reason to have a Muslim society in Persia, which was far more advanced than anybody had advanced.
[01:35:31.505 --> 01:35:35.706]  Now, what happened in effect was Soleimani began to grab power.
[01:35:35.806 --> 01:35:37.487]  He became more and more powerful.
[01:35:38.007 --> 01:35:48.309]  He was one of our allies between 2006-2009 when he was in Iraq, but the reality was, and my own men had said this to me, and I had to turn my own opinion around.
[01:35:48.349 --> 01:35:52.750]  When we invaded Iraq, which I was against, and everybody knows that, I'm still against it.
[01:35:53.331 --> 01:35:58.952]  Nevertheless, we had to deal with a very big issue there, and that issue is something we didn't talk about.
[01:35:59.412 --> 01:36:06.255]  Which was the Iranian soldiers under Soleimani had killed hundreds of our own brave warriors.
[01:36:06.435 --> 01:36:12.917]  It wasn't the Iraqis, it wasn't Al-Qaeda, it wasn't ISIS, it wasn't anybody else except the Iranians.
[01:36:13.518 --> 01:36:21.161]  That left a deep, deep memory in the minds and the hearts of my soldiers, my military intelligence, the CIA.
[01:36:22.061 --> 01:36:23.882]  And we never said very much about it.
[01:36:24.302 --> 01:36:25.222]  But in return, we felt
[01:36:27.236 --> 01:36:30.660]  We felt that this was going to be a lingering problem for us.
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:38.709]  Now, having said all of this, the scenario around the world was perfect for the takedown of Soleimani.
[01:36:38.889 --> 01:36:39.490]  What do I mean?
[01:36:40.387 --> 01:36:53.992]  Number one, in one of my videos I have said in Lebanon a few months ago that the young people of Lebanon, Shiites, Sunnis, all were protesting the corruption of his government.
[01:36:54.012 --> 01:36:58.473]  That's right, we don't need a globalist Arab spring putting radical Muslims in charge of destabilization.
[01:36:58.773 --> 01:37:03.695]  We need a real spring, a real revolution to westernize and have a renaissance which they're ready for.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.121]  Correct.
[01:37:05.261 --> 01:37:07.485]  Now you hit it on the head, Alex.
[01:37:07.626 --> 01:37:10.190]  And that's exactly what's happening right now.
[01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:11.813]  It happened very quickly.
[01:37:11.933 --> 01:37:13.596]  It could only happen under Trump.
[01:37:14.097 --> 01:37:15.901]  And also, this attack
[01:37:16.578 --> 01:37:20.419]  That expels the end of Nancy Pelosi once and for all.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:24.341]  She can't say, oh, we didn't know about this, you know, we weren't briefed.
[01:37:24.401 --> 01:37:24.901]  Too bad!
[01:37:25.441 --> 01:37:32.144]  If you're too busy doing work that's not relevant to the nation state or our foreign policy, you don't belong there.
[01:37:32.564 --> 01:37:36.365]  None of the Democrats belong there because they really weren't involved in any of this.
[01:37:36.385 --> 01:37:37.406]  Well, you know they'd leak it.
[01:37:37.446 --> 01:37:38.426]  They can't help themselves.
[01:37:39.597 --> 01:37:40.758]  It's not a question of league.
[01:37:40.778 --> 01:37:41.839]  They're incompetent.
[01:37:41.959 --> 01:37:45.181]  She doesn't really understand what the republic is about.
[01:37:45.221 --> 01:37:47.182]  She has no understanding of the history.
[01:37:47.502 --> 01:37:49.684]  She has no understanding of how we work.
[01:37:49.844 --> 01:37:51.205]  She really is lazy and stupid.
[01:37:52.842 --> 01:37:56.065]  That's correct, but I would say even more so it's her swan song.
[01:37:56.126 --> 01:38:02.993]  It's not only hers, it's also Schumer, who doesn't understand Schiff, who doesn't understand all these individuals.
[01:38:03.974 --> 01:38:06.737]  They're totally not relevant to the running of our republic.
[01:38:07.157 --> 01:38:10.821]  So when they talk about the deep state, they're not the deep state.
[01:38:11.261 --> 01:38:17.907]  The guys like me and others who have been running this for 30, 40 years, we're going to maintain the republic no matter who's there.
[01:38:18.288 --> 01:38:19.809]  And it's not going to fall apart.
[01:38:19.929 --> 01:38:22.031]  And listen, when you say that, it's not an arrogant statement.
[01:38:22.071 --> 01:38:31.360]  The power is always the people taking their kids to school, the people working out in the fields, the doctors taking care of people, and the people communicating and saying no, and the quiet.
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:35.582]  A silent majority in government corporations that also know what's going on.
[01:38:35.842 --> 01:38:44.866]  And so it was a message to corrupt, evil, powerful oligarchs across the world as we see the nationalist spring, the populist spring, that it's going to spread in the Middle East, Central Asia.
[01:38:45.726 --> 01:38:48.808]  India's now got Hindu nationalists fighting radical Islam.
[01:38:49.088 --> 01:38:50.288]  The world's on fire.
[01:38:50.389 --> 01:38:57.852]  It's awakening and pushing back against these arrogant, corrupt establishments and letting so-called God, Soleimani, invincible mastermind know
[01:38:58.192 --> 01:39:00.297]  No, you're like everybody else and now you're dead.
[01:39:00.638 --> 01:39:02.182]  You're not as special as you thought you were.
[01:39:02.502 --> 01:39:04.226]  And that's what my gut-level instinct was.
[01:39:04.467 --> 01:39:05.850]  We'll talk about it with Dr. Steve Pacino.
[01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:06.732]  You can take your phone calls.
[01:39:07.657 --> 01:39:08.958]  Dr. Steve Pucinich is our guest.
[01:39:08.998 --> 01:39:11.761]  You can find his new book at stevepucinich.com.
[01:39:12.422 --> 01:39:13.122]  Great website.
[01:39:13.402 --> 01:39:17.767]  And remember, the system is fighting to stop everybody from having their own communications.
[01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:20.810]  So, if you support independent media, it is revolutionary.
[01:39:21.130 --> 01:39:23.612]  His new book, American Warrior in Crisis, is excellent.
[01:39:23.632 --> 01:39:28.237]  If you want to read a real memoir of real direct action and special operations, this is it.
[01:39:28.857 --> 01:39:38.927]  And it sounds pretty amazing to go research it, because I'd already studied a lot of history and seen stuff that McChinnick was involved in, and his name in it, at the head of it, and a lot of it, and then people hear the stuff on there, and they're like, that's just too much to be involved in.
[01:39:38.967 --> 01:39:41.770]  Well, you haven't been around in stuff 40, 50 years.
[01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:43.432]  That's what happens when you've done it.
[01:39:43.452 --> 01:39:44.413]  It's really true.
[01:39:45.033 --> 01:39:45.974]  Andy's not a coward.
[01:39:46.014 --> 01:39:47.055]  He'll come on this show.
[01:39:47.556 --> 01:39:48.216]  Let me raise that.
[01:39:48.277 --> 01:39:49.638]  It's an article up on Infowars.com.
[01:39:50.859 --> 01:39:56.881]  Paul Joseph Watson, CFR president, says the world will be a battlefield after Iran escalation.
[01:39:57.441 --> 01:40:02.062]  And so, you've been a member of the CFR, you resigned after 9-11 for the fact that they were involved in it.
[01:40:02.502 --> 01:40:09.964]  Richard N. Haas, and they are really, the establishment's trying to give Trump a backhanded attack.
[01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:13.405]  I thought they loved war so much, but I guess they didn't make this call.
[01:40:14.005 --> 01:40:16.586]  Why does the establishment like what just happened, Dr. Pachinic?
[01:40:17.984 --> 01:40:19.466]  Alex, let me tell the audience.
[01:40:19.566 --> 01:40:28.838]  Number one, the CFR is nothing more than a geriatric unit for has-beens in both the Republican and Democratic administrations.
[01:40:28.919 --> 01:40:30.681]  It was set up by the Rockefellers.
[01:40:30.761 --> 01:40:32.804]  It's run by a bunch of people.
[01:40:32.884 --> 01:40:35.207]  Richard Haass is the paramount
[01:40:35.888 --> 01:40:35.988]  Yes.
[01:40:53.446 --> 01:40:56.608]  And honestly, I left it because it's useless.
[01:40:56.988 --> 01:41:04.831]  Not only is it useless, but they're so self-aggrandizing that these people really don't understand the nature of war.
[01:41:04.871 --> 01:41:07.112]  They don't understand what PSYOPS is.
[01:41:07.412 --> 01:41:09.713]  They don't know what agitation propaganda is.
[01:41:09.773 --> 01:41:10.894]  So they're not relevant.
[01:41:11.194 --> 01:41:15.636]  What you're seeing is that the alternative media, the Alex Jones,
[01:41:16.116 --> 01:41:26.127]  The Owen Schroyers, the Steve Picheniks, we're becoming the mainstream while the New York Times hits us with conspiracy theories and I start laughing.
[01:41:26.228 --> 01:41:30.833]  I said, fine, you want to write in Wikipedia that we're conspiracy theorists?
[01:41:30.973 --> 01:41:32.595]  Fine, I don't particularly care.
[01:41:33.215 --> 01:41:34.956]  I happen to know what the truth is.
[01:41:35.056 --> 01:41:36.797]  You happen to know what the truth is.
[01:41:37.098 --> 01:41:42.000]  The CFR is so antiquated, it's for self-aggrandizing individuals.
[01:41:42.341 --> 01:41:45.783]  You've got the Hillary's, you've got the Clinton's, you've got the Bush's.
[01:41:46.503 --> 01:41:47.724]  It's nonsensical.
[01:41:48.204 --> 01:41:53.566]  I left it not only because of 9-11, I left it because it's a pathetic organization.
[01:41:53.847 --> 01:42:01.290]  And Richard Haass is the paramount, pathetic Jew who talks a lot but never served our country.
[01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:04.091]  And I can go through that whole list of the other leaders.
[01:42:06.092 --> 01:42:08.393]  I mean what a bunch of jerks to hate their country so much!
[01:42:23.362 --> 01:42:24.663]  Well, it's not only that.
[01:42:24.743 --> 01:42:26.705]  There you've got Joe Biden.
[01:42:26.865 --> 01:42:31.948]  What more pathetic... He admitted to crimes at the CFR and Haas clapped!
[01:42:32.409 --> 01:42:34.190]  And all these other little wimps.
[01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:34.851]  Look at this guy.
[01:42:35.551 --> 01:42:37.332]  These are legends in their own minds.
[01:42:38.193 --> 01:42:42.857]  That's my point, but the point is... Imagine that guy in a fistfight.
[01:42:42.997 --> 01:42:44.077]  You want to go to war with that guy?
[01:42:44.097 --> 01:42:45.839]  You think that guy's going to lead America?
[01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:47.240]  You think that guy cares about you folks?
[01:42:49.398 --> 01:42:51.839]  Alex, they're the Mickey Mouse of the world.
[01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:53.699]  You don't even have to engage with them.
[01:42:53.739 --> 01:42:55.660]  They're so irrelevant, you have no idea.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.320]  No, I agree.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:57.541]  I agree, though.
[01:42:59.801 --> 01:43:06.063]  I want to go to some calls, but why is this, in summation, why is this good, what Trump did?
[01:43:06.083 --> 01:43:10.645]  It spurs revolution against the Islamic State, against the Iranian Islamic State.
[01:43:10.685 --> 01:43:11.145]  Why is it good?
[01:43:12.588 --> 01:43:26.561]  It's an amazing action because it basically puts Ayatollah Khamenei into a position where he has nowhere to go and internally he knows that we're going to start agitprop and we're going to take him down.
[01:43:26.981 --> 01:43:37.871]  This is a signal to Iran that we're finally going to take you down, not necessarily with strategic movements in armaments, but we show them how effective we can be on a one-off
[01:43:38.411 --> 01:43:40.052]  Or using our own intelligence.
[01:43:40.152 --> 01:43:45.556]  And it's also a signal to Ayatollah Khomeini, we've pervaded their entire society.
[01:43:46.016 --> 01:43:50.259]  When we need to, we will create the agitprop to bring down Khomeini.
[01:43:50.719 --> 01:43:53.001]  He's counting his last days in effect.
[01:43:53.041 --> 01:43:54.082]  And let's expand on that.
[01:43:54.542 --> 01:43:58.404]  He thought because it was back channels to Obama and others that Trump would already be gone by now.
[01:43:58.665 --> 01:44:02.967]  He shot his mouth off saying you can do nothing, you can't do anything to Trump.
[01:44:03.248 --> 01:44:05.269]  Now he looks like a complete fool to the whole world.
[01:44:06.305 --> 01:44:07.565]  Well, he is a fool.
[01:44:07.585 --> 01:44:08.826]  I mean, even his own father.
[01:44:08.846 --> 01:44:13.607]  I told you, I went to his house and I negotiated with his father, who was very bright.
[01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:18.588]  I don't agree with him, but he said, my own son is not very bright and you're going to have to deal with him.
[01:44:19.088 --> 01:44:21.048]  And the truth is he wasn't very bright.
[01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:27.469]  So he had to depend on a Soleimani who came out of the Iran-Iraq war and he was ruthless.
[01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:34.671]  In turn, what's happening is the corruption that came into the system, including the Iran Revolutionary Guard,
[01:44:35.171 --> 01:44:36.332]  We're good to go.
[01:45:00.367 --> 01:45:02.769]  Trump has said, you know what, Obama?
[01:45:02.949 --> 01:45:04.390]  You know what, John Kerry?
[01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:05.270]  You failed.
[01:45:05.651 --> 01:45:07.752]  The CIA failed on the Brennan.
[01:45:07.852 --> 01:45:17.418]  And what I'm doing is to eliminate the $180 billion you gave in hostage fees to the Iran leaders.
[01:45:17.599 --> 01:45:21.301]  And I'm now making sure that we wiped out that debt.
[01:45:21.321 --> 01:45:23.182]  And that was another question I was going to get to.
[01:45:23.843 --> 01:45:28.806]  You've said, fire a bunch of people at the National Security Council that have worked for Obama and the Bushes and the Clintons.
[01:45:28.986 --> 01:45:29.947]  Trump's now doing that?
[01:45:30.547 --> 01:45:32.990]  And the word is he's going to fire even more.
[01:45:34.111 --> 01:45:34.592]  That's correct.
[01:45:34.632 --> 01:45:43.242]  But thanks to you, I was able to announce it on a video to say, look, Mr. President, you can't have 100 people on the phone.
[01:45:43.322 --> 01:45:46.325]  You've got to have at most maybe 4, 5, or 10.
[01:45:46.906 --> 01:45:50.210]  Under Baker, James Baker, we had a very tight ship.
[01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:53.412]  And by the way, Doc, you're not just saying these messages get to Trump.
[01:45:53.432 --> 01:45:54.753]  We're not just saying that to act powerful.
[01:45:55.013 --> 01:46:01.377]  That's why they have congressional hearings saying, we can't let Infowars in the White House, we've got to keep Trump from it, because he hears this common sense.
[01:46:01.437 --> 01:46:12.925]  We were the ones that exposed Fiona Hill being a Soros operative, and McMaster, they literally want me dead just because of that, which again shows how powerful is the deep state that a radio show out of Texas
[01:46:13.425 --> 01:46:16.369]  Saying to the President, hey, this person's a globalist hurts them.
[01:46:16.429 --> 01:46:20.794]  It shows why can't Trump, though, get more people around him to help him navigate?
[01:46:21.014 --> 01:46:25.139]  Because I get he's a businessman and knows how to get those things done, but he's got to get those traders out.
[01:46:26.331 --> 01:46:33.277]  Well, unfortunately, he bred his own self-destruction on a show that I said two years ago when he brought in the neocons.
[01:46:33.317 --> 01:46:37.680]  When you bring in John Bolton, who is a chicken hawk, I've known John.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:40.903]  He and I have talked and we've worked together.
[01:46:40.943 --> 01:46:44.566]  But honestly, he is nothing more than a war hawk.
[01:46:44.666 --> 01:46:48.149]  But when you say, go to Vietnam, come on, John, you wanted the war.
[01:46:48.209 --> 01:46:51.672]  He said, oh, no, no, I don't want to get killed in the trenches.
[01:46:51.932 --> 01:46:53.032]  Why don't you come to war?
[01:46:53.272 --> 01:46:54.493]  Oh, no, I don't want to get killed.
[01:46:54.553 --> 01:47:03.516]  So what you have is the entrance of a lot of these chicken hawks under John Bolton who came in and said, we're going to go to war.
[01:47:03.716 --> 01:47:05.256]  Well, the time was right.
[01:47:05.396 --> 01:47:10.698]  And Trump measured it very carefully, because you got to remember, Trump doesn't like war.
[01:47:11.038 --> 01:47:14.919]  He has said from the very beginning, war is not a very useful tool.
[01:47:15.379 --> 01:47:17.840]  But what he did was not to create a war.
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:21.441]  It's an announcement of a war to Ayatollah Khamenei.
[01:47:21.521 --> 01:47:27.903]  But basically, he strategically took out two of the key men in the Iran Revolutionary Guard.
[01:47:28.283 --> 01:47:33.104]  And he had announced beforehand, these are terrorist organizations.
[01:47:33.204 --> 01:47:36.045]  And he went forward and he said, I'm not warning you, I'm threatening you.
[01:47:36.305 --> 01:47:37.685]  Phone calls with Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[01:47:37.725 --> 01:47:39.106]  I promise callers, bam, bam, bam.
[01:47:39.346 --> 01:47:40.846]  When we come back, StevePachinik.com.
[01:47:41.146 --> 01:47:43.227]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:47:43.247 --> 01:47:43.787]  We'll be right back.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:46.661]  All right, we got to move quick here.
[01:47:46.681 --> 01:47:48.061]  We got a bunch of loaded phones.
[01:47:48.101 --> 01:47:49.122]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:47:49.142 --> 01:47:53.204]  I got a lot of calls in the first and second hour, but we haven't gotten to any right now.
[01:47:53.264 --> 01:47:54.725]  Dr. Steve Pachinick's writing shotgun with us.
[01:47:54.745 --> 01:48:01.609]  I'll go back to Tareef, who held over, Carlos, Peter, Baldy, Lou, Josh, Justin, Chris.
[01:48:01.629 --> 01:48:06.752]  I'm going to go in the order that your calls have come in, and who would be the longest holding here?
[01:48:06.772 --> 01:48:10.134]  I guess that would be Justin in Virginia.
[01:48:10.154 --> 01:48:12.115]  You're on the air with a comment or question.
[01:48:12.135 --> 01:48:12.576]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:48:13.836 --> 01:48:14.397]  Yes, Alex.
[01:48:16.047 --> 01:48:23.751]  I'm a 31-year-old farmer in Virginia, and my community has really been hit hard in my lifetime.
[01:48:24.311 --> 01:48:29.014]  My population has been replaced with brown people that speak a different language than me.
[01:48:29.634 --> 01:48:32.936]  Countless friends and family have died from heroin overdoses.
[01:48:33.616 --> 01:48:35.857]  The family farms are going away.
[01:48:37.558 --> 01:48:41.060]  And we believe in Trump because he's supposed to be America first.
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:44.181]  And I believe in you, and I feel like crying right now.
[01:48:45.968 --> 01:49:02.439]  I have stickers, your InfoWars stickers on my truck, I buy your products, but you really let me down with this whole situation, and you sound like a fool going in circles trying to cover for Israel and trying to make sense of all this when you know it's not right.
[01:49:02.859 --> 01:49:10.284]  And I love you, Alex, but this isn't right, and you need to get on your hands and knees and repent to your audience and apologize.
[01:49:11.004 --> 01:49:12.965]  This is nuts, and you know it's nuts.
[01:49:13.286 --> 01:49:15.027]  Well, Justin, let me respond.
[01:49:15.979 --> 01:49:20.600]  Okay, I'm fighting the fentanyl coming into the country and so is Trump.
[01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:26.782]  And Iran has a dictatorship that just mowed down 600 of their own people.
[01:49:27.462 --> 01:49:30.823]  Communist China is a dictatorship with 2 million Muslims in concentration camps.
[01:49:30.843 --> 01:49:31.063]  Who cares?
[01:49:31.583 --> 01:49:33.004]  Hold on, hold on, who cares?
[01:49:34.798 --> 01:49:35.999]  I'm not a globalist.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:38.981]  Globalism is for this world government.
[01:49:39.441 --> 01:49:53.131]  I'm for America, but America still has interests, and I don't want these wars, and I've given you my honest view on what Trump did, and I've had play with what Tucker Carlson had to say, and I get his perspective, and we've had callers that agree and disagree.
[01:49:53.371 --> 01:49:56.353]  We're not a cult where we're one thing or we're the other.
[01:49:56.773 --> 01:49:57.874]  We're trying to have a discussion.
[01:49:58.354 --> 01:50:19.777]  Okay, so quantify why I need to get down on my knees, and I'm going to get Dr. Steve Pucinich's take on this, because what I've done, my issue is, I know Iran's running proxy armies all over, I know they're working with elements of the deep state to try to sabotage Trump's plan to get us out of the Middle East, and this would actually lead to Iran being run by their own people.
[01:50:19.977 --> 01:50:20.498]  Absolutely!
[01:50:20.538 --> 01:50:21.158]  You entertained
[01:50:37.695 --> 01:50:44.480]  Hold on, how do you think Trump got North Korea to come to the table?
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:52.926]  The deep state through China had them threatening to attack Japan, everybody, to try to get us into a war and make us look like idiots, and then Trump geared up and they backed down.
[01:50:53.627 --> 01:50:54.748]  Let's give Steve Mnuchin a take.
[01:50:55.088 --> 01:50:56.409]  Doc, you want to comment on what he's saying here?
[01:50:57.278 --> 01:51:01.820]  Well, with all due respect, I came out of the same area this gentleman comes from, Virginia.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:06.102]  If he has a problem, I understand Virginia's a disaster of a state now.
[01:51:06.803 --> 01:51:07.963]  I do what I did.
[01:51:08.163 --> 01:51:09.084]  I moved to the South.
[01:51:09.444 --> 01:51:11.085]  I moved to Florida, to Texas.
[01:51:11.784 --> 01:51:19.251]  The Northeast, Virginia, Maryland, New York, California, Illinois, Michigan will all be finished for simple reasons.
[01:51:19.651 --> 01:51:22.013]  You have governors who are totally ineffectual.
[01:51:22.373 --> 01:51:24.755]  At the local level, you're totally ineffectual.
[01:51:25.016 --> 01:51:28.559]  You don't have commissioners who can do roads or do anything else.
[01:51:28.619 --> 01:51:29.700]  You can complain, sir.
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:31.742]  But the bottom line is very simple.
[01:51:31.802 --> 01:51:33.023]  You come down to the South.
[01:51:33.423 --> 01:51:36.447]  You come down to where we have no taxes and we carry guns.
[01:51:36.827 --> 01:51:38.228]  I think you'll be a happier man.
[01:51:38.268 --> 01:51:39.870]  But don't blame Alex Jones.
[01:51:40.170 --> 01:51:41.432]  This is not his fault.
[01:51:41.472 --> 01:51:42.713]  This is not anybody's fault.
[01:51:42.753 --> 01:51:45.195]  Let me throw it at him this way.
[01:51:45.215 --> 01:51:46.156]  He's allowed to ask a question.
[01:51:46.176 --> 01:51:46.877]  I agree with that.
[01:51:46.897 --> 01:51:48.519]  Let me throw this at him and get both your takes on this.
[01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:55.833]  I got really mad when Trump bombed that little chemical base in Syria, because I thought it meant a huge war like it always has in the past.
[01:51:56.093 --> 01:52:03.337]  He did that to silence the hawks, and to then make the enemies back off, and it was a measured response, and it worked really well.
[01:52:03.857 --> 01:52:04.157]  Okay?
[01:52:04.397 --> 01:52:06.418]  Now, if this gets expansive, I'm not going to be happy.
[01:52:06.559 --> 01:52:08.159]  I think this is a measured response.
[01:52:08.219 --> 01:52:09.620]  I don't like seeing the troops being upped.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:12.582]  It could go bad, but I don't understand how...
[01:52:13.522 --> 01:52:16.524]  How do you think I'm betraying you being pro-war?
[01:52:16.644 --> 01:52:20.527]  I'm not telling Trump what to do and I think we'll still see how this unfolds.
[01:52:23.249 --> 01:52:26.811]  I'm staying in Virginia.
[01:52:26.831 --> 01:52:28.752]  My family's been here since the 1700s.
[01:52:29.172 --> 01:52:31.834]  I'm either fighting or that's all there is to it.
[01:52:34.935 --> 01:52:36.116]  This isn't America First.
[01:52:36.156 --> 01:52:37.997]  We gotta get out of all this stuff.
[01:52:38.117 --> 01:52:40.438]  It is enough, Alex, and you know it is.
[01:52:41.018 --> 01:52:55.345]  Well, I think what Pchenik's saying is, is if that regime goes down, and they get a populist regime in Tehran, that will absolutely stabilize a lot of the Middle East, and you won't have the big Shiite-Sunni conflict, and Saudi Arabia won't have the excuse to be on the warpath.
[01:52:55.625 --> 01:52:57.166]  Is that an accurate statement in your view, Dr. Pchenik?
[01:52:58.021 --> 01:53:01.846]  Yeah, also remember there are allies who agree with what we're doing.
[01:53:01.866 --> 01:53:04.509]  Number one, we couldn't have done this without Russia's agreement.
[01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:08.474]  That's what a week ago, that's when Trump and Putin agreed on it.
[01:53:08.574 --> 01:53:14.342]  Number two, it's a destabilizing force which we need had a resolve in order to shift to East Asia.
[01:53:14.762 --> 01:53:16.383]  We want to get out of the Middle East.
[01:53:16.443 --> 01:53:16.963]  He said it.
[01:53:17.103 --> 01:53:26.967]  In order to get out of the Middle East, we have to resolve a problem that's been the focus of an issue for about 20-30 years, thanks to the Bush, thanks to the Trump administration.
[01:53:27.007 --> 01:53:28.347]  That's what Trump always says.
[01:53:28.387 --> 01:53:30.668]  He's cleaning up the problems the deep state created.
[01:53:30.688 --> 01:53:31.489]  That's why they hate him.
[01:53:31.709 --> 01:53:32.949]  He's tying up the loose ends.
[01:53:32.989 --> 01:53:34.950]  And if he doesn't, then we'll start getting upset.
[01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:39.372]  I mean, Justin, I think you've got to give us a little bit more benefit of the doubt here.
[01:53:42.433 --> 01:53:47.174]  Okay, Justin, I appreciate your call.
[01:53:47.234 --> 01:53:48.635]  I gotta move on to other people, alright?
[01:53:49.335 --> 01:53:50.115]  I gotta move on to other people.
[01:53:50.155 --> 01:53:52.176]  It's very interesting calls and that's how you're able to call in.
[01:53:52.536 --> 01:53:54.637]  CNN and stuff, when they take calls, it's all controlled.
[01:53:55.057 --> 01:53:56.337]  You just called in, you're on the air.
[01:53:56.377 --> 01:53:57.417]  That's what InfoWars is.
[01:53:57.837 --> 01:53:58.318]  Not a cult.
[01:54:00.666 --> 01:54:03.367]  Tharif, we had him on earlier, but I want to hold him over to ask you a question.
[01:54:04.048 --> 01:54:12.231]  Tharif thinks it might have been a false flag by another country, like Saudi Arabia or Israel, with the attack on the oil workers, to get us into this.
[01:54:12.471 --> 01:54:13.472]  What do you think, Dr. Pachinik?
[01:54:14.505 --> 01:54:22.648]  Well, the attack on the oil workers was, I think, it may have well been a false flag, but this had nothing to do with what was going on with Soleimani.
[01:54:22.728 --> 01:54:28.950]  Soleimani, in and of himself, is a real problem for agitation in the Middle East.
[01:54:29.170 --> 01:54:33.531]  For the most part, he is a real problem for Ayatollah Khamenei.
[01:54:33.671 --> 01:54:35.972]  There has been a problem between the both of them.
[01:54:36.392 --> 01:54:42.116]  And what happened in effect is we're resolving an internal and an external problem in Iran.
[01:54:42.236 --> 01:54:47.059]  By taking him out, we're basically saying to Ayatollah Khamenei, now it's your turn.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.541]  You want to make peace or you don't want to make peace?
[01:54:49.561 --> 01:54:50.582]  You don't want to make peace?
[01:54:50.862 --> 01:54:53.664]  We'll go inside of Iran and we already have operatives.
[01:54:53.724 --> 01:54:55.425]  And it's a message to Kim Jong-un.
[01:54:56.406 --> 01:54:56.826]  I'm sorry?
[01:54:57.026 --> 01:54:58.187]  And it's a message to North Korea.
[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:02.983]  The North Koreans, look, Kim Jong-un is not a stupid guy.
[01:55:03.103 --> 01:55:05.446]  As I said, he went to school in Switzerland.
[01:55:05.586 --> 01:55:06.827]  I went to school in Switzerland.
[01:55:06.987 --> 01:55:08.128]  I stayed there for a week.
[01:55:08.208 --> 01:55:08.989]  I was kicked out.
[01:55:09.329 --> 01:55:10.710]  He stayed there for three years.
[01:55:11.111 --> 01:55:12.772]  So he has a clear understanding.
[01:55:12.832 --> 01:55:23.222]  What the problem is, is what he saw under the Clinton, Obama and Bush administrations, that when you say you're an ally like Gaddafi, we then take him out.
[01:55:23.442 --> 01:55:27.904]  Then when we say Saddam Hussein, you know, take away your weapons, then we take them out.
[01:55:28.285 --> 01:55:31.726]  So Kim Jong-un is saying, listen guys, I want to be friendly.
[01:55:31.846 --> 01:55:36.949]  I'm not interested in a war, but the minute you take away my weapons, you take me down.
[01:55:37.129 --> 01:55:41.191]  So the answer is Trump has to convince them, we're not going to take you down.
[01:55:41.371 --> 01:55:42.792]  We'll take your weapons away.
[01:55:43.132 --> 01:55:47.455]  And guess what, Kim Jong-un, I want to build hotels just when you're building.
[01:55:47.475 --> 01:55:50.036]  Kim Jong-un's been waiting to see if Trump can really stay in power.
[01:55:51.397 --> 01:55:52.217]  It's not only that.
[01:55:52.277 --> 01:55:53.098]  He likes Trump.
[01:55:53.138 --> 01:56:00.001]  He knows he'll stay in power, but he wants to see what in turn he can get for concessions that he knows he needs to make.
[01:56:00.121 --> 01:56:02.522]  And that's going to be the piece that The Last Caller really wanted.
[01:56:02.542 --> 01:56:05.464]  All right, we're going to go to break and come back and take a lot of calls.
[01:56:05.484 --> 01:56:06.364]  We're going to go to Chris.
[01:56:06.444 --> 01:56:07.325]  We're going to go to Tony.
[01:56:07.345 --> 01:56:09.045]  We're going to go to Josh, Lou, Baldy, everybody.
[01:56:09.446 --> 01:56:12.247]  Owen Schroer, you're going to have this going with you for a couple hours later in your show.
[01:56:12.507 --> 01:56:14.228]  Briefly, what's your take on this situation?
[01:56:14.861 --> 01:56:34.405]  Well, there's so much to get to, it's tough for 50 seconds left in this segment, but I will just say this, you know, just looking at what we know for sure and kind of the responses we've seen geopolitically, it may be fair to make a comparison to what we saw in Syria where, yeah, we didn't like the airstrikes, we feared further intervention, further war, but now look what's happening in Syria.
[01:56:34.525 --> 01:56:38.166]  Russia's taking over there, their forces are going in, U.S.
[01:56:38.186 --> 01:56:40.087]  forces are retreating, so it's a slow trend
[01:56:42.687 --> 01:56:48.609]  That sometimes seems like maybe we push back when we need to be coming out, but maybe that's what you need to clear some space to get out.
[01:56:48.669 --> 01:56:49.370]  So we'll see.
[01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:50.290]  I agree with the caller.
[01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:52.451]  We need to get out, but it's going to be messy.
[01:56:52.951 --> 01:56:55.532]  And look, the guy was responsible for killing hundreds of U.S.
[01:56:55.572 --> 01:56:57.473]  troops, and the Democrats are denouncing his murder.
[01:56:57.513 --> 01:57:00.774]  I mean, how bad does that look for the Democrat Party on top of everything else?
[01:57:01.174 --> 01:57:01.674]  That's right.
[01:57:01.935 --> 01:57:03.195]  And Trump's making deals with Turkey, too.
[01:57:03.215 --> 01:57:07.357]  We're going to take a lot of your phone calls right now with Dr. Steve Pucinich.
[01:57:07.377 --> 01:57:10.818]  He'll be back on to give some deep analysis with Owen Schroer on The War Room today.
[01:57:12.441 --> 01:57:14.843]  3 to 6 p.m., what, Dr. Pachinick's on at 4 o'clock with you?
[01:57:15.763 --> 01:57:16.444]  Yeah, 4 o'clock.
[01:57:16.464 --> 01:57:18.905]  We're going to have an hour with Dr. Steve Pachinick.
[01:57:18.945 --> 01:57:22.247]  Glad to have him on The War Room today with his expert analysis.
[01:57:22.267 --> 01:57:23.668]  We'll also be taking calls as well.
[01:57:23.688 --> 01:57:28.752]  Alright, I want to speak of the devil, get to the calls, but I just want to say this, going back to the caller before last.
[01:57:29.650 --> 01:57:31.031]  I think his name was Justin from Virginia.
[01:57:31.772 --> 01:57:33.273]  I really study the way the world works.
[01:57:33.453 --> 01:57:35.335]  And I really study how governments work and all the rest of it.
[01:57:35.375 --> 01:57:44.884]  And Trump's legitimately trying to have economic power and work with countries and not have this destabilization, strategy of tension, globalist plan.
[01:57:44.904 --> 01:57:45.825]  He's very pragmatic.
[01:57:46.525 --> 01:57:51.830]  And there's this word people just salivate and get sycophantic when they hear about Israel.
[01:57:52.791 --> 01:57:55.835]  And go, oh, you're for this war, you're for Israel.
[01:57:56.435 --> 01:57:57.697]  I want out of the Middle East.
[01:57:57.737 --> 01:57:59.839]  We've got to deal with China if you want to talk about a real threat.
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:03.343]  And Trump's trying to pivot there, as Pucinich just said, that's a fact.
[01:58:03.984 --> 01:58:06.407]  And then people are just like, oh, you're doing it for Israel.
[01:58:06.527 --> 01:58:08.049]  Oh, Israel is giving me orders right now.
[01:58:08.449 --> 01:58:09.711]  That's ridiculous.
[01:58:09.731 --> 01:58:11.132]  Hunter Pucinich is a huge critic.
[01:58:11.973 --> 01:58:13.275]  of Israel, if anybody knows that.
[01:58:13.775 --> 01:58:15.157]  That's just asinine.
[01:58:15.637 --> 01:58:18.481]  He's tried to run projects to round up all the Israeli spies.
[01:58:19.221 --> 01:58:21.524]  But people call in, though, and it's just like magic.
[01:58:21.864 --> 01:58:26.770]  Oh, you're against the Iranian regime because they hate Israel.
[01:58:27.190 --> 01:58:31.135]  Some people hate Israel so much, they love the Iranian mullahs.
[01:58:31.555 --> 01:58:32.977]  That is just crazy, Dr. Pachinik.
[01:58:34.386 --> 01:58:36.247]  Well, let me put it this way.
[01:58:36.487 --> 01:58:41.209]  Israel created a myth about Judaism, about the Holocaust.
[01:58:41.250 --> 01:58:42.810]  You know, I've talked about it before.
[01:58:42.850 --> 01:58:46.092]  The American Jew really doesn't understand what the Holocaust is.
[01:58:46.612 --> 01:58:48.393]  He makes up numbers of six million.
[01:58:48.413 --> 01:58:49.594]  But the fact is, Bibi,
[01:58:50.314 --> 01:58:50.654]  Yes.
[01:59:10.879 --> 01:59:12.160]  And by the way, you really did do that.
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:13.800]  People think you're just... But let's go back.
[01:59:13.841 --> 01:59:15.541]  You really lost family to Hitler.
[01:59:15.882 --> 01:59:20.464]  It's on record that you, you know, came to the... Yeah, I lost my family, but the point was this.
[01:59:20.584 --> 01:59:29.889]  I mean, Hitler's one thing, but the one thing nobody talks about is, before Hitler came to power, my mother came out of Russia, said, what about the Soviet Union and Stalin?
[01:59:30.249 --> 01:59:34.071]  He killed 7 million Christians before Hitler even came to power.
[01:59:34.411 --> 01:59:34.711]  I totally agree.
[01:59:34.731 --> 01:59:46.575]  What you're saying is that you've exposed the professors and the books that are out there that there was actually a large group of Jews that wouldn't let Jews get out of Germany and Poland and made them pay to the other Jews.
[01:59:47.655 --> 01:59:49.836]  Well, look, it's very simple.
[01:59:50.236 --> 01:59:55.278]  Who created the IBM tickets that knew we were Christians and all?
[01:59:55.358 --> 01:59:56.138]  Tom Watson.
[01:59:56.558 --> 01:59:59.079]  Who gave Mengele the projects for eugenics?
[01:59:59.259 --> 02:00:03.040]  That was Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Brothers.
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:05.022]  You created concentration camps.
[02:00:05.362 --> 02:00:06.143]  It was the British, 1898.
[02:00:07.103 --> 02:00:14.370]  Unless you learn your history, as you said, Alex, you're going to be a fool and you will just repeat the nonsense of Israel.
[02:00:14.730 --> 02:00:17.092]  Israel didn't take in any Holocaust Jews.
[02:00:17.112 --> 02:00:17.852]  They didn't want it.
[02:00:18.333 --> 02:00:27.040]  When Ben-Gurion was asked by Eichmann, who spoke Hebrew, he said, do you want three to four hundred thousand of these people in the camps?
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:28.782]  He said, no, I'd rather have pigs.
[02:00:29.182 --> 02:00:33.144]  And ironically, guess who was the leader of taking away the Jews?
[02:00:33.464 --> 02:00:36.786]  A man by the name of Heydrich, an Austrian Jew.
[02:00:37.207 --> 02:00:42.570]  So within Hitler's army, there were over 146,000 Jews.
[02:00:43.110 --> 02:00:47.432]  Two out of the five field commanders, I'm getting tired of this, were Jews.
[02:00:47.492 --> 02:00:51.975]  That was the big secret that Hitler was really a Rothschild, and I've looked into it, it's true!
[02:00:53.246 --> 02:00:54.227]  I didn't make this up.
[02:00:54.487 --> 02:00:59.610]  I mean, the whole thing about Israel is a cockamamie story that we need a land of the Jews.
[02:00:59.670 --> 02:01:05.174]  No, in 1965, America pulled out, so they came up with the story of the Holocaust.
[02:01:05.474 --> 02:01:06.414]  I'm not even against Israel.
[02:01:06.655 --> 02:01:14.920]  All I'm trying to say is these ignoramuses call in and magically go, oh, you're doing this for Israel, when they don't even know what they're talking about.
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:16.481]  Or who they're talking to!
[02:01:16.601 --> 02:01:17.782]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[02:01:17.862 --> 02:01:21.545]  I feel like that's just kind of a different approach than sitting here saying... It's like saying you're a Russian agent!
[02:01:21.765 --> 02:01:23.967]  Or, oh, you work for the Jews, or you work for the Vatican!
[02:01:24.167 --> 02:01:25.589]  No, I work for freedom, dammit!
[02:01:25.849 --> 02:01:27.710]  I have integrity, and I'm sick of that crap!
[02:01:28.071 --> 02:01:32.174]  It's just another thing like, oh, they're all wars for oil, or they're all wars for regime change.
[02:01:32.194 --> 02:01:34.636]  There's a lot of different factors that go into these wars in the Middle East.
[02:01:34.696 --> 02:01:41.341]  It's a very complex issue, but the problem is... And half the damn oil goes through there, and the Iranians and the...
[02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:44.331]  And the Saudis are about to kill each other!
[02:01:44.371 --> 02:01:45.553]  We're gonna have World War III!
[02:01:45.834 --> 02:01:47.237]  Let's look at the issue at hand now.
[02:01:47.477 --> 02:01:48.199]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:01:49.244 --> 02:01:52.506]  You have people concerned now that Iran is going to strike the United States.
[02:01:52.566 --> 02:01:58.710]  But again, it's my understanding, if you're making comparisons here, this was a drone strike targeted on one individual.
[02:01:58.730 --> 02:02:00.011]  Looks like it just blew up a car.
[02:02:00.311 --> 02:02:01.412]  No weddings got hit.
[02:02:01.472 --> 02:02:04.333]  No civilization centers got hit.
[02:02:05.094 --> 02:02:07.836]  It wasn't a place where residents and civilians were running around.
[02:02:07.856 --> 02:02:13.779]  And the guys they killed literally run these bulldozers where they haul women and children up by their necks and kill them if they don't wear hijabs.
[02:02:13.879 --> 02:02:15.260]  The guy's a damn butcher.
[02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:15.960]  He's dead now.
[02:02:16.021 --> 02:02:17.742]  The Department of Defense released documents.
[02:02:18.502 --> 02:02:20.744]  Claiming this guy was responsible for over 500 U.S.
[02:02:21.104 --> 02:02:23.866]  troops deaths and being maimed over there as well.
[02:02:24.346 --> 02:02:27.008]  So again, but how about this Alex?
[02:02:27.068 --> 02:02:29.049]  Let's just look at what we know and what's developing.
[02:02:29.569 --> 02:02:33.992]  So now you have all these Democrats and leftists saying, oh we're afraid Iran is going to strike.
[02:02:35.393 --> 02:02:37.794]  We've got a wide open border right now, okay?
[02:02:38.054 --> 02:02:45.717]  And we're going to sit here and bitch about what's going on in the Middle East, and you're going to have wide open southern border, and you're concerned about Iran attacking us?
[02:02:45.737 --> 02:02:47.617]  Well, let's do something about the border.
[02:02:47.637 --> 02:02:48.998]  No, I totally agree we have to do something about that.
[02:02:49.158 --> 02:02:50.919]  Let's take a call from Chris in Washington.
[02:02:50.939 --> 02:02:51.639]  Thanks, Chris, for holding.
[02:02:51.659 --> 02:02:52.739]  You're on the air with Dr. Steve Pachinick.
[02:02:52.779 --> 02:02:53.239]  Owen Schroer.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.360]  Yeah, hey, thanks.
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:57.701]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:02:58.770 --> 02:03:06.073]  Dr. Pajenek, Alex, Owen, I appreciate all that you do and all the wisdom that you guys have together.
[02:03:06.193 --> 02:03:07.513]  You're all together.
[02:03:07.533 --> 02:03:13.455]  I don't have anything knowledgeable other than I agree with everything you're saying.
[02:03:13.756 --> 02:03:16.857]  I mean, you guys have been hitting it right on the spot.
[02:03:18.197 --> 02:03:19.097]  Well, I appreciate your call, Chris.
[02:03:19.137 --> 02:03:20.038]  Let me ask Dr. Pajenek this.
[02:03:21.269 --> 02:03:21.870]  Sleeper cells.
[02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:27.097]  How big a threat is that with the Quds and their militias and embedded groups?
[02:03:27.678 --> 02:03:32.425]  And how are the neocons and globalists going to try to spin this towards their aims?
[02:03:34.299 --> 02:03:37.080]  One, there aren't that many sleeper cells.
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:38.061]  We're not worried about it.
[02:03:38.141 --> 02:03:40.822]  Number one, you got to look at how big we are as a nation.
[02:03:41.242 --> 02:03:41.822]  We're huge.
[02:03:41.903 --> 02:03:45.504]  We're four time zones larger than most countries.
[02:03:45.664 --> 02:03:50.446]  In terms of the neocons, this is what they started with 9-11.
[02:03:50.506 --> 02:03:53.188]  This is what they started in the Iran-Iraq War.
[02:03:53.228 --> 02:03:54.628]  You got to go back to the 1980s.
[02:03:55.369 --> 02:04:00.571]  For the gentleman in Virginia, he's got to understand this goes back to the 1980s when we initiated
[02:04:01.071 --> 02:04:03.074]  Wars again, Iraq and Iran.
[02:04:03.154 --> 02:04:05.478]  And guess who flew for Iran?
[02:04:05.618 --> 02:04:06.499]  The Israelis.
[02:04:07.162 --> 02:04:14.267]  In the 1980s, for eight years, the Israelis flew on behalf of the Irans without marked airplanes.
[02:04:14.607 --> 02:04:16.468]  In turn, we flew for Iraq.
[02:04:16.929 --> 02:04:29.057]  So what happened as a result of that war, and Soleimani came out of that war as a major, major soldier, and it was like World War I. One million people died in Iraq.
[02:04:29.237 --> 02:04:30.898]  One million people died in Iran.
[02:04:31.358 --> 02:04:31.938]  I was there.
[02:04:32.338 --> 02:04:34.199]  I saw the massacre of it.
[02:04:34.599 --> 02:04:45.122]  It was worse than World War I. It had nothing to do with Israel other than the fact we asked Israel and the Iranian Houmeini to fly on behalf of the Iranians.
[02:04:45.422 --> 02:04:49.683]  This was a war started under the Bush administration, the Reagan administration.
[02:04:50.083 --> 02:04:54.085]  We sent, Schultz had sent, tear gas to that area.
[02:04:54.405 --> 02:04:55.745]  I was there when they sent it.
[02:04:56.065 --> 02:04:58.086]  So if you want to go back to history,
[02:04:59.594 --> 02:05:00.214]  Mustard gas.
[02:05:00.234 --> 02:05:00.835]  That's correct.
[02:05:01.315 --> 02:05:02.416]  We sent mustard gas.
[02:05:02.496 --> 02:05:04.817]  Now, you know, and your fans know it.
[02:05:04.857 --> 02:05:07.639]  Do you think anybody in the news has talked about that?
[02:05:07.979 --> 02:05:08.079]  No.
[02:05:08.783 --> 02:05:19.768]  You think anybody in the news goes back to the Carter administration or the Reagan administration or the Bush administration, all of which I was in and I was against, but nevertheless, I served my country.
[02:05:19.828 --> 02:05:24.470]  So it's very easy for somebody in Virginia to say, oh, I'm disappointed in this and that.
[02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:28.292]  It's much harder to be what you have to be, a citizen soldier.
[02:05:28.612 --> 02:05:29.752]  You don't like what happens?
[02:05:30.092 --> 02:05:31.093]  Try to make it better.
[02:05:31.673 --> 02:05:32.934]  You work at the local level.
[02:05:32.974 --> 02:05:34.675]  You don't like what happens at the local level?
[02:05:34.695 --> 02:05:36.096]  Then work at the national level.
[02:05:36.357 --> 02:05:37.618]  But stop complaining.
[02:05:37.878 --> 02:05:40.780]  Americans have to stop complaining and understand.
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:42.441]  You don't like what's happening?
[02:05:42.721 --> 02:05:43.562]  Then organize.
[02:05:43.722 --> 02:05:45.063]  If you want to be a Democrat?
[02:05:45.143 --> 02:05:45.403]  Fine.
[02:05:45.423 --> 02:05:46.544]  You want to be an Independent?
[02:05:46.644 --> 02:05:46.905]  Fine.
[02:05:46.945 --> 02:05:48.286]  You want to be another party?
[02:05:48.386 --> 02:05:48.746]  Fine.
[02:05:49.106 --> 02:05:51.108]  But don't tell me about your miseries.
[02:05:51.208 --> 02:05:55.011]  We have a huge country where we're doing exceedingly well.
[02:05:55.051 --> 02:05:56.752]  Well, I think I don't want to get derailed by that caller.
[02:05:56.932 --> 02:06:01.296]  My whole point is, we're all legitimately having a massive discussion and debate about, was this right?
[02:06:01.916 --> 02:06:07.561]  And I think we're saying we give Trump the benefit of the doubt, and we see the strategy, and we hope it doesn't go terribly bad.
[02:06:08.281 --> 02:06:11.324]  But we're doing it as Americans who have that right, and we're all on the same team.
[02:06:11.344 --> 02:06:13.546]  Well, we need to respect the elements here, Alex, too.
[02:06:13.586 --> 02:06:20.411]  I mean, if you play a game of football when it's a clear day out versus when it's snowy and windy, you're going to play a different game.
[02:06:20.431 --> 02:06:21.632]  And that's what we're dealing with here.
[02:06:21.873 --> 02:06:23.894]  The Obama administration had different elements.
[02:06:24.155 --> 02:06:25.736]  The Bush administration had different elements.
[02:06:25.956 --> 02:06:27.517]  The Trump administration has different elements.
[02:06:27.537 --> 02:06:30.338]  So we're dealing with an entirely different set of elements here.
[02:06:30.458 --> 02:06:33.279]  And I believe Trump is America first and he's proving it.
[02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:34.959]  And so we give him the benefit of the doubt.
[02:06:35.119 --> 02:06:43.543]  And it's not easy to sit here like if you look at the carryovers on the foreign policy from the Bush administration, from the Clinton administration, from the Obama administration, from the Bush administration.
[02:06:43.883 --> 02:06:45.043]  It's kind of the same elements.
[02:06:45.083 --> 02:06:48.144]  So it's easier to come on in response to something Obama or Bush did.
[02:06:48.404 --> 02:06:49.885]  It's usually moving the same agenda.
[02:06:50.385 --> 02:06:51.766]  It's a different set of elements now.
[02:06:52.067 --> 02:06:57.852]  We're still kind of looking at the field, analyzing how everything's ending up laying on this whole geopolitical chessboard.
[02:06:58.252 --> 02:07:00.034]  And maybe things will look clearer in 24 to 48 hours.
[02:07:00.054 --> 02:07:00.655]  Beautifully said.
[02:07:00.715 --> 02:07:08.942]  I want to do five more minutes with Dr. Pachinic, the Syrian girl who lives in Australia, but whose family was in the ruling party at the top in Syria.
[02:07:08.962 --> 02:07:09.483]  Really smart.
[02:07:09.543 --> 02:07:10.824]  She's against what happened.
[02:07:10.844 --> 02:07:11.825]  We're going to get her perspective.
[02:07:12.085 --> 02:07:13.426]  That'll make some folks mad as well.
[02:07:13.706 --> 02:07:19.508]  But final segment with Dr. Steve Pachinic will be back on at 4 to give deeper analysis with Owen Schroer on The War Room.
[02:07:19.548 --> 02:07:20.468]  That's 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:07:20.788 --> 02:07:23.869]  Band.video on the satellites for radio and TV.
[02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:27.071]  Only way people find out about it is you, the awesome listeners, taking the action.
[02:07:27.091 --> 02:07:28.591]  There's no radio or TV like this anywhere else.
[02:07:28.811 --> 02:07:29.892]  And it's all thanks to your support.
[02:07:30.232 --> 02:07:32.293]  The big year-end sales end on Monday.
[02:07:32.593 --> 02:07:33.393]  Biggest sales ever.
[02:07:33.433 --> 02:07:35.514]  Take advantage of them before they end at fullwarrestore.com.
[02:07:37.824 --> 02:07:41.086]  All right, I want to go to Carlos, who really wants to talk to Pchenik, and a bunch of others.
[02:07:41.126 --> 02:07:42.447]  I'll continue into the hour with your calls.
[02:07:42.467 --> 02:07:43.368]  Syrian Girl's popping in.
[02:07:43.388 --> 02:07:45.109]  Owen's going to have Pchenik back on today.
[02:07:45.129 --> 02:07:46.429]  Hopefully for a couple hours he can do it.
[02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:48.431]  But I was asking you.
[02:07:49.741 --> 02:07:57.386]  When Remington said, you supply the pitchers, I'll supply the war, when Hearst said that to Remington, I know what war propaganda is.
[02:07:57.426 --> 02:07:59.548]  I know when it's a major push coming out of the government.
[02:08:00.008 --> 02:08:15.679]  And I know Trump's not in full control of the government yet, but when they do these pushes on me with the fake Sandy Hook news, you know, that I've lost lawsuits and stuff, usually it's not even true, on every channel on New Year's Eve while the balls are dropping, who the hell is giving that order in your view and what is that?
[02:08:17.205 --> 02:08:20.429]  Let me put it this way so that the American public understands.
[02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:26.055]  The deep, deep state that we're talking about is not about Clinton or any of that.
[02:08:26.196 --> 02:08:30.180]  We have a phenomenon called the Mockingbird Phenomenon that was done in the 1950s.
[02:08:30.801 --> 02:08:35.687]  What happened was the CIA, as it grew up, came out of the OSS, made a deal.
[02:08:36.307 --> 02:08:46.952]  With Graham of the Post, with Paley of newspapers, with all the Washington Post, the New York Times, CBS, Paley of CBS.
[02:08:47.272 --> 02:09:00.118]  We all agreed in that time in the 50s and later on in the 60s that much of the news that will come out has to be integrated with our intelligence and our propaganda machinery.
[02:09:00.718 --> 02:09:10.983]  So, an Alex Jones who comes out of the mainstream or becomes a paradigm shift, eventually becomes encompassed within that discussion.
[02:09:11.003 --> 02:09:11.783]  And what do I mean?
[02:09:12.383 --> 02:09:15.164]  Most people don't understand the deep, deep state.
[02:09:15.224 --> 02:09:17.345]  It's nothing about Hillary or anybody else.
[02:09:17.485 --> 02:09:20.247]  It's really a constant Hegelian dialectic.
[02:09:20.287 --> 02:09:23.968]  To make it very simple, we go both Democrat and Republican.
[02:09:24.008 --> 02:09:29.811]  We create tensions on both sides to maintain the viability of the republic and the vitality.
[02:09:30.331 --> 02:09:36.357]  So when you think the New York Times is hating Alex Jones, you better think again who is really hating Alex Jones.
[02:09:36.377 --> 02:09:42.923]  And if you think Alex Jones is just simply attacking the New York Times, then you better ask, why does a guy like Pichenik come on?
[02:09:43.283 --> 02:09:45.866]  And why is he asked repeatedly, will you come on?
[02:09:46.106 --> 02:09:51.831]  So the point I'm trying to say to the American public is, you're part of an ongoing revolution.
[02:09:53.112 --> 02:09:55.775]  That's part of the narrative of the republic.
[02:09:56.195 --> 02:10:08.425]  But the average leftists really legitimately hate me and don't even get that they're being invoked to attack by smarter folks that understand out of the clash and the process it'll help reignite Americana.
[02:10:08.445 --> 02:10:10.707]  I'm not saying I'm not organic and totally legitimate.
[02:10:10.787 --> 02:10:11.548]  I'm my real self.
[02:10:11.888 --> 02:10:15.471]  You're just saying the archetype is being used in a dialectic conflict.
[02:10:15.731 --> 02:10:16.291]  Correct.
[02:10:16.571 --> 02:10:28.377]  Now, and you've got to understand, I'm putting a Nancy Pelosi against Alex Jones on any spectrum that makes no sense.
[02:10:28.997 --> 02:10:33.819]  A woman who's literally on a swan song with a man who's constantly been
[02:10:34.239 --> 02:10:34.459]  I think?
[02:10:55.331 --> 02:10:55.971]  Republic.
[02:10:56.272 --> 02:10:59.493]  And once again, the republic is not a democracy.
[02:10:59.853 --> 02:11:04.396]  We have representatives... So it's just like the founders created separation of powers at every level.
[02:11:04.836 --> 02:11:11.579]  It's a real conflict, but it's being set up so that people can make their own decision and see how pathetic the globalists are.
[02:11:11.819 --> 02:11:12.740]  And this is a process.
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:15.061]  That's exactly correct.
[02:11:15.101 --> 02:11:19.863]  But you have to remember, and this is what the Democrats do not understand and the liberals.
[02:11:21.178 --> 02:11:28.083]  Hamilton, Madison, all of our great Jefferson hated the tyranny of the masses.
[02:11:28.703 --> 02:11:34.187]  They came, they saw the revolution in France and what happened to King Louis XVI.
[02:11:34.507 --> 02:11:38.030]  And they said, we will not have that in our own revolution.
[02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:41.532]  That's why they did not accept the tyranny of democracy.
[02:11:41.832 --> 02:11:46.015]  And that's exactly what Pelosi and the Democrats have no idea about what they
[02:11:46.075 --> 02:11:52.809]  So before Hegel ever codified it, the founders had already put in a Hegelian dialectic into the country itself, which is the secret to the republic.
[02:11:53.803 --> 02:11:54.904]  You are brilliant.
[02:11:54.944 --> 02:11:56.085]  You hit it right on the head.
[02:11:56.145 --> 02:11:57.966]  You see, you should have been a professor at MIT.
[02:11:58.026 --> 02:11:58.946]  No, no, no.
[02:11:59.147 --> 02:11:59.947]  Hey, Doc, you're awesome.
[02:12:00.487 --> 02:12:01.428]  Please come back soon.
[02:12:01.488 --> 02:12:02.629]  You will, on the show with Owen.
[02:12:02.949 --> 02:12:03.569]  StevePchenek.com.
[02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:04.650]  People can find your new book there.
[02:12:04.670 --> 02:12:04.970]  Thank you.
[02:12:05.070 --> 02:12:06.131]  Grow a beard, Alex.
[02:12:06.191 --> 02:12:07.052]  Do I have to grow a beard?
[02:12:07.072 --> 02:12:07.112]  No.
[02:12:07.532 --> 02:12:08.192]  I don't have any.
[02:12:08.753 --> 02:12:08.953]  No.
[02:12:11.434 --> 02:12:13.176]  Alex is going to shave his head, actually.
[02:12:13.516 --> 02:12:15.397]  I'm thinking about shaving mine, but not now that he did it.
[02:12:15.997 --> 02:12:16.978]  Hey, hey, thank you, Doctor.
[02:12:16.998 --> 02:12:19.800]  All right, hey, I'm going to jam these calls in, Owen.
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:20.780]  Syrian Girl's coming up.
[02:12:21.061 --> 02:12:21.901]  Thank you so much, Owen.
[02:12:21.921 --> 02:12:23.082]  You're going to be on with the Pchenek in an hour.
[02:12:23.402 --> 02:12:23.962]  Yes, that's right.
[02:12:24.043 --> 02:12:24.283]  War room.
[02:12:24.323 --> 02:12:24.803]  All right.
[02:12:25.063 --> 02:12:25.424]  Stay with us.
[02:12:26.945 --> 02:12:27.205]  All right.
[02:12:27.265 --> 02:12:28.326]  Syrian girl's here with us.
[02:12:28.426 --> 02:12:29.506]  I appreciate her coming on.
[02:12:29.627 --> 02:12:30.747]  I want to jam your calls in.
[02:12:30.847 --> 02:12:33.649]  I did good the first hour or two, then I got behind with Pachinikon.
[02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:36.151]  But it's been a powerful broadcast today.
[02:12:36.191 --> 02:12:37.092]  We're praying for peace.
[02:12:37.132 --> 02:12:38.193]  We hope this doesn't escalate.
[02:12:39.213 --> 02:12:40.254]  But I see why Trump did it.
[02:12:40.314 --> 02:12:44.057]  Now, Syrian girl is a really smart lady, and she's been on many times over the years.
[02:12:44.077 --> 02:12:45.298]  It's been too long since she's been on.
[02:12:45.698 --> 02:12:46.499]  I'm glad she's here.
[02:12:47.719 --> 02:12:52.241]  And you can find her on Twitter at Partisan Girl and at Patreon at Syrian Girl.
[02:12:52.881 --> 02:12:57.482]  And I'm not going to go into her past or who she is, but maybe she should recap.
[02:12:57.502 --> 02:13:00.943]  She hasn't been on the show in probably a year, which she should be on every day with this stuff going on.
[02:13:01.583 --> 02:13:02.684]  And she's welcome to not.
[02:13:03.024 --> 02:13:04.724]  She doesn't have to tell me, Alex, you've done good.
[02:13:04.784 --> 02:13:05.745]  I like you, but you're wrong.
[02:13:06.305 --> 02:13:13.547]  I respect her perspective because when you've got all these countries doing this, a lot of times both sides can be right, depending on your perspective.
[02:13:13.567 --> 02:13:15.067]  And I'm not being moral relativist here.
[02:13:15.087 --> 02:13:16.308]  It's just it does.
[02:13:17.463 --> 02:13:18.663]  You know, depend on where you're at.
[02:13:19.563 --> 02:13:30.026]  But she's definitely been a very accurate person on the fake chemical attacks, on what's happened in Syria, how Iran came in and helped stop Al Qaeda and ISIS taking over and killing all the religious minorities.
[02:13:30.406 --> 02:13:33.166]  So I think that the Soleimani, you know, did good work there.
[02:13:33.947 --> 02:13:36.807]  But, you know, now you've got proxy wars and the rest of this stuff going on.
[02:13:37.027 --> 02:13:39.168]  So she's here to give us her take on that.
[02:13:39.188 --> 02:13:40.388]  So thanks for coming on, Syrian Girl.
[02:13:41.977 --> 02:13:43.618]  Thanks so much for having me on, Alex.
[02:13:44.359 --> 02:13:52.986]  Even though I don't have to say it, I still really respect the fact that you allow people onto your show, even if you don't agree on everything.
[02:13:53.506 --> 02:13:54.587]  So I'm glad to be here.
[02:13:55.048 --> 02:13:57.449]  Oh yeah, well I mean, I'm going to agree with your perspective.
[02:13:57.469 --> 02:13:58.871]  I think you're right about all this.
[02:13:58.951 --> 02:14:04.715]  It's just that Iran's been pushing us around, and Trump, and working with the deep state, I think, to embarrass Trump.
[02:14:04.735 --> 02:14:05.916]  So that's why he went ahead and killed him.
[02:14:06.457 --> 02:14:07.618]  And so I know why Trump did it.
[02:14:07.658 --> 02:14:10.000]  I'm not even saying in the fullness of it, I think it's a good idea.
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:12.141]  But I do see why Trump did it.
[02:14:12.261 --> 02:14:14.083]  But give us your expert take on this.
[02:14:16.064 --> 02:14:20.527]  Well, firstly, this man, you know, this is probably the first anyone in the U.S.
[02:14:20.547 --> 02:14:21.368]  has heard of him.
[02:14:21.728 --> 02:14:27.973]  But he is actually a very powerful general in the Iranian military, probably the most powerful general.
[02:14:28.413 --> 02:14:32.016]  And in fact, he was working with the United States to fight ISIS.
[02:14:32.396 --> 02:14:32.476]  Yes.
[02:14:50.612 --> 02:14:51.052]  We're good to go.
[02:15:12.336 --> 02:15:12.597]  True.
[02:15:12.617 --> 02:15:14.179]  This is just justification.
[02:15:14.981 --> 02:15:17.625]  This is about isolating Iran.
[02:15:17.986 --> 02:15:22.513]  The problem they have is that the deep state had this goal.
[02:15:22.934 --> 02:15:25.619]  They were going to get in Syria
[02:15:26.408 --> 02:15:27.589]  Al-Qaeda in power.
[02:15:27.969 --> 02:15:36.154]  So if we remember during, you were there, I know you fought against the Iraq War in 2003, and all the propaganda and lies that we were told then.
[02:15:36.474 --> 02:15:42.698]  We were told that the Shiites were going to greet the United States as liberators, and that they were going to get rid of Saddam.
[02:15:43.139 --> 02:15:47.081]  And after 2003, they got rid of Saddam, which wasn't a religious man.
[02:15:47.801 --> 02:15:51.504]  And they basically, under the U.S.
[02:15:52.364 --> 02:15:54.926]  control, they installed the Shiite government.
[02:15:55.589 --> 02:16:02.532]  And now in Syria, they're trying to get rid of Assad and install, well, they tried to install a Muslim Brotherhood government.
[02:16:02.572 --> 02:16:03.232]  We know that.
[02:16:03.513 --> 02:16:05.153]  That's just a fact of history.
[02:16:05.173 --> 02:16:15.178]  And we know that al-Qaeda and the leader of al-Qaeda is still holed up in Idlib, where the leader of ISIS was also holed up, al-Baghdadi.
[02:16:15.798 --> 02:16:28.506]  And yet, we have statements coming out from the White House saying that they don't want Assad and Russia to go in and get al-Jolani, and yet they have time to assassinate this Iranian guy that fought ISIS.
[02:16:29.031 --> 02:16:40.137]  So, the plan was to get Shiites in power in Iraq, to get the Muslim Brotherhood or Sunni extremists in power in Syria, and then have them fight each other.
[02:16:40.477 --> 02:16:41.638]  Now, that didn't work out.
[02:16:41.958 --> 02:16:45.941]  So now, the Iranian presence in Iraq has become more of a liability.
[02:16:46.321 --> 02:16:47.942]  And that's why they're targeting it.
[02:16:48.302 --> 02:16:53.365]  And if you notice, last week, when they struck the Iraqi-Syrian border,
[02:16:54.105 --> 02:17:03.250]  That also goes to show you that what they're targeting here is that alliance, that connection between Iraq, Syria and Iran.
[02:17:03.911 --> 02:17:07.273]  And that's what's, it's a danger not to the United States, but to Israel.
[02:17:07.293 --> 02:17:12.136]  They don't want Iran linking up and creating their own Shiite Islamic State through there.
[02:17:12.636 --> 02:17:15.978]  Why then, and of course what you're saying is true from that perspective, you're right.
[02:17:16.658 --> 02:17:23.202]  Why then did they attack the embassy and give Trump the pretext to kill him?
[02:17:24.895 --> 02:17:28.096]  Well, Iran didn't attack the embassy.
[02:17:28.656 --> 02:17:32.097]  It was Iraqis who were protesting outside the embassy.
[02:17:32.297 --> 02:17:38.158]  The reason they protested was because of the bombing that happened on the Syrian-Iraqi border.
[02:17:38.698 --> 02:17:52.501]  Those Iraqis, while they were supportive of Iran, at the same time we have to remember that a couple of weeks prior to that, other Iraqis that were supported by the United States attacked the Iranian embassy and destroyed that.
[02:17:53.081 --> 02:17:57.750]  So there was all this stuff happening beforehand that nobody is linking together.
[02:17:57.770 --> 02:18:02.159]  You're right about all that, but they did go into the facility and burn a bunch of it down and take stuff too.
[02:18:02.179 --> 02:18:03.401]  They weren't just protesting outside.
[02:18:07.022 --> 02:18:09.405]  The Iranian Embassy was burned as well.
[02:18:09.445 --> 02:18:13.269]  They went inside that and burned it too, but Iran never assassinated people.
[02:18:24.116 --> 02:18:30.244]  Well, unfortunately, you know, these militias that Iran is supporting... Hello?
[02:18:30.505 --> 02:18:33.348]  Sorry, there was an error message that popped up on my computer.
[02:18:33.689 --> 02:18:37.975]  These militias, they did fight ISIS alongside American soldiers.
[02:18:39.176 --> 02:18:45.459]  Yes, they are militias, but the fact is even Syria has had to use militias because the army wasn't enough.
[02:18:45.519 --> 02:18:49.300]  They called them PMF, the People's Mobilization Forces.
[02:18:50.201 --> 02:18:56.583]  So, unfortunately, because ISIS was overrunning the country, they had to dig in to get militias.
[02:18:56.623 --> 02:18:59.364]  But those militias did help out.
[02:18:59.704 --> 02:19:01.505]  And why create enemies of them now?
[02:19:01.605 --> 02:19:02.325]  That's the question.
[02:19:02.345 --> 02:19:03.286]  What's going to happen now?
[02:19:03.646 --> 02:19:05.887]  Well, we're witnessing what's happening now.
[02:19:06.247 --> 02:19:10.789]  They're going to have a troop surge and the Iraq invasion is going to happen all over again.
[02:19:10.809 --> 02:19:17.431]  It's going to be 2020 is now 2003 all over again, except now there's no allies.
[02:19:17.691 --> 02:19:21.733]  There's no Shiites to work alongside with as there was in 2003.
[02:19:22.173 --> 02:19:26.855]  Now both the Sunnis, the Shiites and even some of the Kurds have been disgruntled.
[02:19:27.175 --> 02:19:28.276]  Now they're all the enemy.
[02:19:28.596 --> 02:19:32.157]  And who has been supportive of such a troop surge?
[02:19:32.517 --> 02:19:34.518]  Nancy Pelosi said it was needed.
[02:19:34.958 --> 02:19:39.440]  I mean, this woman, you know, her father actually was one of the founders of Israel.
[02:19:39.961 --> 02:19:47.504]  He was part of one of the original terrorist organizations that was active before Israel was created.
[02:19:47.524 --> 02:19:53.227]  It was regarded as a terrorist organization by the British to try to create Israel.
[02:19:53.607 --> 02:19:56.549]  So, you know, she has obviously a stake in this.
[02:19:56.849 --> 02:20:02.912]  And I wonder if this whole impeachment against Trump was to try to force his hand into doing this stuff.
[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:10.443]  Well, and then you say all that and it starts convincing me because I know the history of all that.
[02:20:10.483 --> 02:20:11.264]  It's absolutely true.
[02:20:11.584 --> 02:20:15.267]  I think Trump's legitimately trying to get us out of these wars.
[02:20:16.147 --> 02:20:24.593]  The deep state's been trying to stop that, but he did work with Russia and at least got back to allow the ISIS-Al Qaeda groups to be taken out.
[02:20:24.613 --> 02:20:25.533]  He's trying to work with Turkey.
[02:20:25.553 --> 02:20:27.575]  I think they're trying to mop that up.
[02:20:27.635 --> 02:20:28.876]  Correct me if you think I'm wrong.
[02:20:29.576 --> 02:20:31.578]  I know the deep state tried to embarrass Trump to
[02:20:33.439 --> 02:20:37.244]  Through Kim Jong-un and China until Trump got strong and then Kim Jong-un backed down.
[02:20:37.264 --> 02:20:40.868]  So I think Trump's really sending a message to... With Putin as well!
[02:20:42.109 --> 02:20:44.072]  Say that again?
[02:20:45.253 --> 02:20:46.394]  Sorry, with Putin too!
[02:20:47.355 --> 02:20:51.060]  Sure, so what do you think Trump thinks he's doing is my question.
[02:20:53.250 --> 02:20:59.372]  I think they told him that this is a bad man that killed people and we need to take him out.
[02:20:59.452 --> 02:21:01.813]  I don't think he realizes the gravity of the situation.
[02:21:02.193 --> 02:21:06.635]  Because now, this man is one of the most powerful men in Iran.
[02:21:07.275 --> 02:21:10.696]  I don't think he's the second most powerful.
[02:21:10.736 --> 02:21:13.257]  He was the most popular and most powerful person.
[02:21:13.277 --> 02:21:17.899]  Because Ayatollah is a moron, reportedly.
[02:21:18.999 --> 02:21:21.200]  We just killed the head of the Iranian government.
[02:21:22.526 --> 02:21:23.767]  Something along those lines.
[02:21:23.888 --> 02:21:28.092]  And so anyone in the Iranian government right now is going to feel personally under threat.
[02:21:28.152 --> 02:21:34.379]  And if you're going to feel, or even any of the world leaders right now are feeling personally under threat.
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:38.204]  And if that's the case, you know, they have to retaliate.
[02:21:38.224 --> 02:21:41.007]  They have to do something to align their own lines.
[02:21:41.167 --> 02:21:43.608]  Syria girl, and I promise callers, I'm gonna get to you one way or another.
[02:21:43.628 --> 02:21:46.029]  I love you, I appreciate you, and I respect you, and I apologize.
[02:21:46.049 --> 02:21:49.690]  I haven't gone to you yet, but Carlos and Josh, everybody, I'm coming to you next with Syria girl.
[02:21:49.710 --> 02:21:53.011]  But listen how smart she is, listen how smart Pchenik is, listen to all this.
[02:21:53.311 --> 02:21:54.431]  This is real politics.
[02:21:54.451 --> 02:21:55.732]  This is how really complex it is.
[02:21:56.052 --> 02:21:57.172]  It's not just this or that.
[02:21:57.232 --> 02:21:58.113]  It's really complex.
[02:22:00.433 --> 02:22:05.055]  You know, Nick Begich is an incredible brain, a good friend of mine.
[02:22:06.287 --> 02:22:07.408]  And I have the fourth hour.
[02:22:07.428 --> 02:22:12.711]  The guest hosts know that I bump him, but I tend to just bump him every Friday now, and I apologize to him, but he's happy to do that.
[02:22:13.151 --> 02:22:22.417]  And I want to invite him up to host the main show with me sometime next week and get into other subjects of secret sciences and the admissions of weather modification and just so much more.
[02:22:22.457 --> 02:22:26.400]  But I'm going to continue on for the rest of the hour to make sure we get to all your calls.
[02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:28.561]  But the president was just speaking live.
[02:22:29.201 --> 02:22:33.124]  We'll get Syrian girl's response in his first public statement.
[02:22:33.984 --> 02:22:35.406]  about the situation with Iran.
[02:22:35.446 --> 02:22:36.207]  It's very important.
[02:22:36.467 --> 02:22:38.850]  So let's go to the president right now, then we'll go to your calls.
[02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:42.293]  Errol Qasem Soleimani.
[02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:55.907]  Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.
[02:22:58.072 --> 02:23:05.735]  Under my leadership, America's policy is unambiguous to terrorists who harm or intend to harm any American.
[02:23:06.955 --> 02:23:07.816]  We will find you.
[02:23:07.836 --> 02:23:09.376]  We will eliminate you.
[02:23:09.777 --> 02:23:15.599]  We will always protect our diplomats, service members, all Americans, and our allies.
[02:23:16.999 --> 02:23:23.182]  For years, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its ruthless Quds Force
[02:23:24.173 --> 02:23:30.236]  Under Soleimani's leadership has targeted, injured and murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen.
[02:23:31.337 --> 02:23:32.878]  The recent attacks on U.S.
[02:23:32.938 --> 02:23:49.467]  targets in Iraq, including rocket strikes that killed an American and injured four American servicemen very badly, as well as a violent assault on our embassy in Baghdad, were carried out at the direction of Soleimani.
[02:23:51.041 --> 02:24:00.050]  Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London.
[02:24:00.971 --> 02:24:10.241]  Today we remember and honor the victims of Soleimani's many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over.
[02:24:10.481 --> 02:24:13.464]  We're going to pause for one moment to let our Fox stations join us.
[02:24:14.127 --> 02:24:19.171]  Perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years.
[02:24:20.052 --> 02:24:23.274]  What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago.
[02:24:23.294 --> 02:24:26.256]  A lot of lives would have been saved.
[02:24:26.377 --> 02:24:39.106]  Just recently, Soleimani led the brutal repression of protesters in Iran, where more than a thousand innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government.
[02:24:40.227 --> 02:24:42.209]  We took action last night to stop
[02:24:43.413 --> 02:24:43.853]  A war.
[02:24:45.134 --> 02:24:48.655]  We did not take action to start a war.
[02:24:49.776 --> 02:24:52.197]  I have deep respect for the Iranian people.
[02:24:53.037 --> 02:24:58.039]  They are a remarkable people with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential.
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:00.981]  We do not seek regime change.
[02:25:01.021 --> 02:25:10.925]  However, the Iranian regime's aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors, must end, and it must end now.
[02:25:12.657 --> 02:25:26.524]  The future belongs to the people of Iran, those who seek peaceful coexistence and cooperation, not the terrorist warlords who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad.
[02:25:27.464 --> 02:25:32.247]  The United States has the best military by far anywhere in the world.
[02:25:33.167 --> 02:25:35.268]  We have the best intelligence in the world.
[02:25:35.748 --> 02:25:38.670]  If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all
[02:25:39.761 --> 02:25:53.331]  Of those targets already fully identified, and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary, and that in particular refers to Iran.
[02:25:54.551 --> 02:26:05.559]  Under my leadership, we have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and recently American special operations forces killed the terrorist leader known as al-Baghdadi.
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:08.802]  The world is a safer place
[02:26:09.875 --> 02:26:24.400]  Without these monsters, America will always pursue the interests of good people, great people, great souls, while seeking peace, harmony, and friendship with all of the nations of the world.
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:24.960]  Thank you.
[02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:25.880]  God bless you.
[02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:28.621]  God bless our great military.
[02:26:28.741 --> 02:26:31.682]  And God bless the United States of America.
[02:26:31.722 --> 02:26:32.442]  Thank you very much.
[02:26:32.682 --> 02:26:32.982]  Thank you.
[02:26:38.004 --> 02:26:50.375]  Clearly it's about the fact that the Islamic regime is very unpopular and there is an attempt to overthrow it by the people and folks want that to happen and Trump does not want a Shiite Sunni civil war starting.
[02:26:50.935 --> 02:26:54.979]  They let the Iranians go in with the Russians and that's who mainly did most of the work.
[02:26:55.539 --> 02:26:59.923]  So when Trump's talking about taking out Al Qaeda and ISIS, I love our military, but it was Russia and the Iranians.
[02:27:00.583 --> 02:27:03.506]  Now the Iranians are like, hey, we're going to take everything else over, we're not stopping.
[02:27:03.766 --> 02:27:11.092]  And so in Trump's view and why he made the decision, as I predicted, it's why he did it, they said, sir, he's going to keep expanding, just like ISIS, so we have to stop him too.
[02:27:11.572 --> 02:27:14.214]  So Trump said, I took action to stop a war.
[02:27:15.315 --> 02:27:18.838]  Now let's see if he can control the neocons and the deep staters from that.
[02:27:20.026 --> 02:27:22.327]  Because once you feed the pirate, it's going to want more and more.
[02:27:22.847 --> 02:27:26.269]  But I do think they came, just like Syrian Girl said, and said, sir, he's a bad guy.
[02:27:26.289 --> 02:27:27.409]  He does all this.
[02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:30.470]  You can show him at public executions, hanging people and stuff.
[02:27:31.511 --> 02:27:33.192]  And Trump said, well, get that guy.
[02:27:33.212 --> 02:27:35.773]  Because he's a real personal type guy.
[02:27:35.793 --> 02:27:37.013]  He doesn't want to just kill random troops.
[02:27:37.313 --> 02:27:38.514]  Oh, you want me to kill the head of something?
[02:27:38.534 --> 02:27:39.014]  I'll do that.
[02:27:39.554 --> 02:27:40.995]  So that's my view.
[02:27:41.295 --> 02:27:45.337]  And Syrian Girl, your response to what you just saw the President Trump say?
[02:27:47.233 --> 02:27:49.814]  I was more interested in what he didn't say.
[02:27:49.834 --> 02:27:58.097]  What was missing in his speech was any mention of al-Qaeda and the leader of al-Qaeda, al-Julani, which is still in Syria's Idlib.
[02:27:58.117 --> 02:28:07.181]  We're being told that he needed to really kill this guy, but what about the guy that he really needs to kill, the people that we're told are responsible for 9-11?
[02:28:10.245 --> 02:28:15.770]  It's because that guy is currently fighting Assad, and the deep state doesn't want him removed.
[02:28:15.810 --> 02:28:18.032]  They don't want al-Qaeda to be removed.
[02:28:18.412 --> 02:28:25.358]  And actually, The Guardian translated one of al-Qaeda's, one of the leader of al-Qaeda's speeches recently.
[02:28:25.779 --> 02:28:27.620]  So that was, you know, very interesting.
[02:28:27.901 --> 02:28:30.603]  But yet here killing the people who are fighting ISIS.
[02:28:30.943 --> 02:28:37.089]  And I do have to say, you know, the fact is that the Shiites already took over everything.
[02:28:37.937 --> 02:28:41.180]  In Iraq, since 2003, they already had everything.
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:53.870]  So, but that was the point of the Iraq War, because they told us that the Shiites were the majority, and that Saddam was, you know, had a Sunni, he was a Sunni and he was leading a Sunni minority, and that's why we have to flip it over to them.
[02:28:54.711 --> 02:28:58.354]  And they indeed want, the deep state wanted a civil war.
[02:28:58.714 --> 02:29:01.536]  And that's why the, then in 2004, the US
[02:29:03.758 --> 02:29:09.040]  His ambassador wrote a constitution that federalized and cut up and carved up the country.
[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:10.441]  They wanted a civil war.
[02:29:10.921 --> 02:29:20.305]  So, not to mention, you remember when they set up those explosives and they pretended that they were dressed up as terrorists while they were setting it up, the British in Bastrop.
[02:29:20.525 --> 02:29:29.009]  No, that's right, but I mean, you just... Trump's being told, though, he's going to stop a civil war, so he thinks he's stopping the previous policy of civil war, but you think he's being set up.
[02:29:30.313 --> 02:29:33.375]  I'm very confused as to how this could stop a civil war.
[02:29:33.395 --> 02:29:38.657]  This has nothing to do with anything to do with civil war.
[02:29:39.658 --> 02:29:48.522]  But Trump, we know, is being surrounded gradually by more and more swampish people, like Pompeo, like Lindsey Graham.
[02:29:49.843 --> 02:29:53.164]  The fact is that he has been given bad intelligence in the past.
[02:29:53.524 --> 02:29:56.686]  For example, on Syria and the chemical attack that happened
[02:29:57.066 --> 02:29:59.007]  You're absolutely right.
[02:29:59.027 --> 02:29:59.407]  Stay there.
[02:29:59.427 --> 02:30:03.509]  I want you to rise shotgun with me and I promise, if the hair didn't rise over Bear Creek,
[02:30:23.317 --> 02:30:26.399]  That's a combination of the hair, lips, the admiral, and watered-down rounds for Bear Creek.
[02:30:27.139 --> 02:30:28.480]  Very politically incorrect, I apologize.
[02:30:28.700 --> 02:30:29.600]  We're going to go to Carlos.
[02:30:30.521 --> 02:30:31.281]  We're going to go to Peter.
[02:30:31.321 --> 02:30:31.902]  We're going to go to Gary.
[02:30:31.922 --> 02:30:34.603]  We're going to go to Tony, Mosh, Wildman, Baldy, Josh.
[02:30:34.743 --> 02:30:36.564]  I promise you, bam, bam, bam, get ready.
[02:30:37.024 --> 02:30:39.426]  I'm going as your calls came in on the other side with Syrian girls.
[02:30:39.446 --> 02:30:39.826]  Stay with us.
[02:30:41.427 --> 02:30:43.328]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:46.229 --> 02:30:47.170]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.450]  Okay.
[02:30:48.783 --> 02:30:50.164]  I've been doing a lot better job taking calls.
[02:30:50.384 --> 02:30:53.246]  I'm taking probably four times, five times the calls that I used to.
[02:30:55.047 --> 02:31:01.331]  And the calls are amazing, but I'll suddenly go to like 10, 15 calls and we get a bunch of guests on, everybody sits there for two hours.
[02:31:01.631 --> 02:31:06.254]  And so we're going to go to you here in just a minute or two.
[02:31:07.695 --> 02:31:11.357]  And then I've got some of the statements of Chuckie Schumer, all these folks.
[02:31:11.417 --> 02:31:13.619]  But I do agree with Syrian girl.
[02:31:15.936 --> 02:31:24.678]  He's very informed about business and a lot of other things, about PR, and he does care about the country, but he has not really been studying geopolitical systems like a lot of people have.
[02:31:25.798 --> 02:31:28.959]  And his instincts about being against war are very, very good.
[02:31:28.979 --> 02:31:32.059]  And that's what scared the neocons and others about him.
[02:31:32.119 --> 02:31:36.560]  But this killing Soleimani is a huge deal.
[02:31:36.600 --> 02:31:37.480]  He's the leader of Iran.
[02:31:37.941 --> 02:31:38.681]  He's not the number two.
[02:31:40.101 --> 02:31:44.722]  And I don't see how they don't respond.
[02:31:46.755 --> 02:31:48.177]  If they're smart, they wouldn't respond.
[02:31:48.838 --> 02:31:51.742]  And the truth is, the deep state is incompetent.
[02:31:52.283 --> 02:31:52.684]  A lot of them.
[02:31:52.924 --> 02:31:53.625]  And they're scared of him.
[02:31:53.765 --> 02:31:56.489]  I mean, they've got sleeper cells around the world.
[02:31:56.529 --> 02:31:59.494]  I mean, Dr. Pachinik is a smart guy, but he's like, oh, we know who they are.
[02:31:59.514 --> 02:32:00.255]  It's not that big a threat.
[02:32:03.413 --> 02:32:05.974]  The hysteria that will happen if there's a big terror attack.
[02:32:06.014 --> 02:32:07.654]  And then the liberties we'll lose because of it.
[02:32:07.975 --> 02:32:09.055]  All the borders wide open.
[02:32:09.555 --> 02:32:10.635]  And the troop escalation.
[02:32:10.755 --> 02:32:11.716]  I don't like any of this.
[02:32:11.896 --> 02:32:12.556]  I like Trump.
[02:32:12.636 --> 02:32:13.396]  I know why he did it.
[02:32:13.956 --> 02:32:17.778]  And if the reason he did it turns out to be correct, well then he's right.
[02:32:18.078 --> 02:32:19.258]  But it's a hell of a gamble.
[02:32:19.358 --> 02:32:24.640]  The problem is, Iran is playing hanky-panky in the Gulf.
[02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:25.740]  They are pulling games.
[02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:26.841]  I get they're under sanctions.
[02:32:26.861 --> 02:32:27.581]  They're pushing back.
[02:32:28.701 --> 02:32:29.982]  Are they supposed to just take it laying down?
[02:32:30.933 --> 02:32:31.413]  No, thank you.
[02:32:55.882 --> 02:32:58.004]  What do you think is going to come out of this?
[02:32:58.684 --> 02:33:00.265]  What do you think the neocons are going to do?
[02:33:00.625 --> 02:33:01.946]  How do you think Iran is going to respond?
[02:33:03.788 --> 02:33:04.108]  Sure.
[02:33:04.468 --> 02:33:12.014]  Well, you know, I think we both agree that after 16 years of war in Iraq, you know, most people want U.S.
[02:33:12.074 --> 02:33:13.234]  soldiers to come home.
[02:33:14.535 --> 02:33:22.001]  And that now that ISIS has been defeated for the majority, that's what's supposed to happen.
[02:33:24.611 --> 02:33:28.675]  But the military-industrial complex, that would make them lose a lot of money.
[02:33:29.375 --> 02:33:31.637]  And so they wanted another excuse to stay.
[02:33:32.038 --> 02:33:34.520]  So now they targeted the people that were fighting ISIS.
[02:33:35.801 --> 02:33:38.083]  This is an act, what happened was an act of war.
[02:33:38.784 --> 02:33:41.746]  This is, if anything's an act of war, this is it.
[02:33:41.766 --> 02:33:47.752]  This is the kind of thing that started World War I. And now we are at a threat of world war.
[02:33:47.812 --> 02:33:49.713]  We are a threat of war, a big war.
[02:33:52.552 --> 02:33:55.974]  Soleimani was one of the people that made the Iran nuclear deal.
[02:33:56.515 --> 02:34:05.781]  In the same way that Gaddafi, you know, he actually made a deal with the US to end Europe and made an alliance with them and he got rid of his chemical weapons, etc.
[02:34:06.301 --> 02:34:11.665]  But what this thing has shown us is that you can't make peace deals with these neocons in this deep state.
[02:34:12.045 --> 02:34:12.225]  Wow.
[02:34:12.245 --> 02:34:14.066]  You just can't because they'll kill you later.
[02:34:14.086 --> 02:34:19.550]  Syrian girl, everybody always makes that point about if people work with the globalists they get
[02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:43.776]  Betrayed and you know what you're right Soleimani actually did make a deal with Obama and the rest of them that he made a deal with Trump to help finish up getting rid of Isis and now this happens to him It looks like they'll work with you until it advances their position But as soon as it starts advancing somebody else's position then they betray him and that's not a good way to operate Do you think Trump knows that he's done that?
[02:34:45.689 --> 02:35:04.846]  No, I'm sure that he's been fed exactly what the American people have been fed, which is these people are terrorists and they're killing Americans, which we don't know the names of the Americans that they've supposedly been killing, that they killed this contractor in, actually the contractor was killed in the Kurdish areas.
[02:35:05.518 --> 02:35:08.400]  Where the Shiite militias don't even really operate.
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:19.807]  Sure, but the argument's going to be that the Mullahs are unpopular and that, you know, this guy had a lot of blood on his hands and was torturing a lot of people and that we should get out of the Iranians' way and let them have regime change.
[02:35:19.827 --> 02:35:21.448]  I think that's really what this comes down to.
[02:35:21.928 --> 02:35:27.291]  And so if I seem schizophrenic on this topic, I'm not on most, it's because I go back and forth because I can see both sides of it.
[02:35:27.671 --> 02:35:28.352]  We're not a cult.
[02:35:28.392 --> 02:35:31.174]  We're having real debates here and real discussions.
[02:35:31.274 --> 02:35:32.214]  Syria Girl's our guest.
[02:35:32.514 --> 02:35:33.935]  Carlos, you're a real trooper for holding.
[02:35:33.975 --> 02:35:35.056]  I really appreciate you.
[02:35:35.536 --> 02:35:40.700]  He's a longtime caller, always a very smart fellow, geopolitically a doctor, I guess, or scientist or something, I forget.
[02:35:41.361 --> 02:35:45.083]  But Carlos, give us your take on this situation.
[02:35:46.004 --> 02:35:46.604]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:35:47.265 --> 02:35:48.966]  Syria girl, you're one of my heroes.
[02:35:49.106 --> 02:35:52.048]  Believe it or not, you've done a great contribution.
[02:35:52.169 --> 02:36:00.395]  And I want you to analyze my comments as I make them, because your input is really even more valuable than most people realize.
[02:36:00.415 --> 02:36:03.497]  First of all, Iran is a
[02:36:04.187 --> 02:36:05.989]  An old civilization of people.
[02:36:06.009 --> 02:36:07.450]  They've been around the bend.
[02:36:07.870 --> 02:36:10.392]  This is a society that is very, very wise.
[02:36:10.412 --> 02:36:14.636]  And I believe with all my heart that they will take this in stride.
[02:36:14.956 --> 02:36:16.638]  They will keep their gunpowder dry.
[02:36:17.038 --> 02:36:18.219]  They will think about it.
[02:36:18.499 --> 02:36:27.527]  And they will rely on their allies, Russia and China, in a situation like North Korea, where I believe peace will prevail.
[02:36:27.667 --> 02:36:29.789]  I don't think President Trump wants a war.
[02:36:30.419 --> 02:36:37.222]  His actions, however, have to be looked at in international law and whether they were in fact warranted under the circumstances.
[02:36:37.802 --> 02:36:42.624]  I know that Iran and Dr. Pashinyan was absolutely right.
[02:36:43.104 --> 02:36:45.205]  You have to be understood in history.
[02:36:45.585 --> 02:36:49.327]  If you don't look at history, you're going to make serious mistakes.
[02:36:49.947 --> 02:36:55.449]  I hope this action by President Trump is not revealed to be a very serious mistake.
[02:36:56.306 --> 02:37:08.897]  Rather, that if you look at the history of Iran, it was at one point a strategic move by Kissinger to have a pincer with Israel and Iran cooperating with the Shah.
[02:37:09.418 --> 02:37:14.142]  The Shah was not doing the things he was supposed to do.
[02:37:14.222 --> 02:37:16.464]  He was resented by the Iranians.
[02:37:16.504 --> 02:37:20.508]  He created the SAVAK, terrible organization, terrible crew.
[02:37:21.241 --> 02:37:26.845]  I remember that his agreement reform was lousy and he was removed by the people.
[02:37:26.885 --> 02:37:27.165]  My feeling?
[02:37:27.185 --> 02:37:31.548]  That it's going to end by Russia and China keeping Iran from going any further with this and I hope that President Trump
[02:37:42.196 --> 02:37:43.077]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:37:43.117 --> 02:37:45.158]  Let's go ahead and talk to some more callers.
[02:37:45.218 --> 02:37:47.740]  Peter in the Midwest, thanks for holding your trooper.
[02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:48.300]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:38:04.622 --> 02:38:05.222]  Hey, Jones.
[02:38:05.762 --> 02:38:09.784]  I'm sorry, Syrian girl, you're beautiful.
[02:38:10.184 --> 02:38:15.566]  Got to say that because I've been following you for a while because I also fought kind of in Syria.
[02:38:16.667 --> 02:38:18.147]  Alex, I got to be quick on this.
[02:38:18.508 --> 02:38:20.088]  I was also an operator in China.
[02:38:21.169 --> 02:38:23.910]  I walked in kind of on some plans regarding a pipeline.
[02:38:23.930 --> 02:38:25.550]  The pipeline is now fully functional.
[02:38:26.011 --> 02:38:29.012]  There's a friendship pipeline between Syria and Iran and Iraq.
[02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:34.485]  There's a new one that just got started last year from Iran to China and Russia.
[02:38:34.886 --> 02:38:36.487]  There is going to be peace in that region.
[02:38:36.527 --> 02:38:37.548]  There's going to be plenty of money.
[02:38:38.289 --> 02:38:41.112]  But the thing is, if you think about it, guess what just happened last week?
[02:38:41.352 --> 02:38:47.919]  Where a lot of maneuvers between China, Iran and Russia for the naval military and exercise were being carried out in the region.
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:50.662]  America was invited, but they didn't want to do it.
[02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:55.113]  No, they said that there was a deal that Trump and Putin just carried out.
[02:38:55.514 --> 02:39:05.723]  Well, if you think about it, if you want a good energy deal, and you got somebody like Soleimani, who's got a lot of Iranian Shiite militiamen that are coming back off the Iraqi-Syrian border,
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:12.763]  And these people don't have anything else where to go because Russians are not going to let them go further.
[02:39:13.723 --> 02:39:15.925]  SAA is taking out FSA very quickly.
[02:39:16.325 --> 02:39:22.408]  But I really wanted to let you know that there was another thing that I was more concerned about that I got wind of from some of my military contacts in Africa.
[02:39:22.969 --> 02:39:29.953]  That some of the FSA Al-Qaeda backed operatives, about 700 of them, got flown out of Idlib and got placed down into Africa.
[02:39:30.173 --> 02:39:33.495]  And there's wind about them trying to collect Ebola and trying to use it.
[02:39:34.522 --> 02:39:35.644]  Okay, well that's amazing.
[02:39:36.024 --> 02:39:39.629]  Listen, I'm... Callers are just... I held for three hours for you Alex.
[02:39:39.649 --> 02:39:40.010]  No, no, no.
[02:39:40.030 --> 02:39:40.390]  Stay there.
[02:39:40.430 --> 02:39:42.373]  I'm saying don't... Don't... Don't hang up.
[02:39:42.433 --> 02:39:43.334]  Start getting into it right now.
[02:39:43.355 --> 02:39:45.658]  I've got to go to these breaks, but start telling us about the Ebola.
[02:39:46.719 --> 02:39:47.801]  Yeah, this is big.
[02:39:49.363 --> 02:39:50.343]  We got 30 seconds to break.
[02:39:50.363 --> 02:39:51.243]  Start telling us.
[02:39:51.283 --> 02:39:51.643]  Here I go.
[02:39:51.663 --> 02:39:52.304]  I gotta go quick.
[02:39:52.324 --> 02:39:54.144]  I know you gotta do the breaks and stuff.
[02:39:54.604 --> 02:39:55.164]  It's like this.
[02:39:55.304 --> 02:39:59.745]  They've been working with Human Smuggling Rings, with Al Shabab, the French Special Forces guys.
[02:39:59.765 --> 02:40:01.245]  They're fighting in Mali right now.
[02:40:01.345 --> 02:40:04.526]  They're still trying to contain it because they don't want to get them out of the Congolese region.
[02:40:04.546 --> 02:40:08.627]  Still some Congolese make their way through and get themselves down to Mexico.
[02:40:08.687 --> 02:40:10.907]  And then from there, that's why we've been seeing the outbreaks that we have.
[02:40:10.947 --> 02:40:13.528]  And you've been talking about the Ebola vaccinations and stuff.
[02:40:13.588 --> 02:40:16.308]  And that's kind of a front, really, because... I gotta hear it.
[02:40:16.328 --> 02:40:16.849]  You gotta hold.
[02:40:16.869 --> 02:40:17.769]  We'll come right back to you.
[02:40:17.789 --> 02:40:18.209]  Stay with us.
[02:40:18.429 --> 02:40:18.909]  Gotta hold more.
[02:40:21.041 --> 02:40:25.906]  I'll tell you the ultimate sin in my view is these groups that set up things to play all the different sides.
[02:40:26.547 --> 02:40:28.509]  They call that being Machiavelli, being geniuses.
[02:40:28.549 --> 02:40:30.912]  I call it mental illness, the knowledge of evil.
[02:40:32.674 --> 02:40:38.320]  But definitely Ebola can last in men's testicles for months and months, can be spread.
[02:40:38.340 --> 02:40:42.385]  It's a perfect sleeper cell type human bomb weapon.
[02:40:43.698 --> 02:40:49.743]  And I know they bring in Congolese with 1,000 every month right through past the border patrol the Democrats do and then disperse them.
[02:40:49.763 --> 02:40:51.045]  People are dying of kidney failure.
[02:40:51.305 --> 02:40:53.607]  There reportedly are Ebola cases in the Caribbean.
[02:40:53.647 --> 02:40:54.388]  That's mainstream news.
[02:40:54.848 --> 02:40:55.469]  And in the U.S.
[02:40:55.509 --> 02:40:56.189]  it's being covered up.
[02:40:56.770 --> 02:40:57.951]  People go, why doesn't Trump stop it?
[02:40:58.051 --> 02:41:00.773]  He can't control what's happening in the office next to him because of the treason.
[02:41:01.234 --> 02:41:09.081]  So just recap, Peter, and tell us what you were told by your sources and what's happening out of Central Africa.
[02:41:10.061 --> 02:41:10.322]  All right.
[02:41:10.956 --> 02:41:17.521]  Basically, FSA, the Free Syrian Arab Army, most are really getting crushed by SAA and their al-Qaeda back operatives.
[02:41:17.541 --> 02:41:19.262]  These are pro-human smugglers and stuff.
[02:41:19.282 --> 02:41:20.983]  They all got moved out of Syria.
[02:41:21.003 --> 02:41:22.044]  They got flown on a plane.
[02:41:22.064 --> 02:41:23.505]  They got put into Central Africa.
[02:41:23.865 --> 02:41:32.912]  And this has been going on for a few years now, ever since the second endemic outbreak of the Congo version of a virus, where actually it's like a, it's a second version where it actually lasts a lot longer.
[02:41:32.932 --> 02:41:34.433]  It's got a 50-50 death ratio.
[02:41:35.143 --> 02:41:51.256]  They've been actively attacking all of the Congolese Ebola centers down there, trying to get a sample of the virus, trying to get the vaccine, trying to figure it out, trying to get people that have been vaccinated with it that were tested on the virus that are still technically communicable, and getting them out of Congo, getting them
[02:41:51.986 --> 02:41:58.050]  First, they tried to get him into Nigeria, and they tried to get him over to the other borderlands, and they've been still trying to smuggle these people.
[02:41:58.150 --> 02:42:01.212]  Now the Congolese people are getting into Mexico, they're coming here.
[02:42:02.093 --> 02:42:08.117]  And by the way, we've shown hundreds ourselves, and then literally let this come over and attack us here in Austin.
[02:42:08.177 --> 02:42:08.898]  It's crazy.
[02:42:09.827 --> 02:42:11.449]  Yeah, there's your sleeper cell, Alex.
[02:42:11.509 --> 02:42:21.844]  It's really nasty stuff, and it's disgusting because the destabilization in our own country regarding all of, you know, the human waste and everything on the West Coast and that stuff, it's just a breeding ground for it.
[02:42:21.904 --> 02:42:22.826]  You already know about that.
[02:42:23.634 --> 02:42:31.478]  Secondly, the Iran-China-Russia connection, if they've just got their pipeline working, they've got it working through the Stans, through Kazakhstan.
[02:42:31.939 --> 02:42:34.520]  Astana is growing as a massive capital right now.
[02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:36.761]  Pakistan's going to start growing up with Karachi.
[02:42:37.241 --> 02:42:38.722]  And then, of course, even Mongolia.
[02:42:38.822 --> 02:42:44.205]  All of these regions are going to get a bunch of natural gas because Iran found a whole bunch more of natural gas reserves.
[02:42:44.465 --> 02:42:44.885]  We're good to go.
[02:43:01.102 --> 02:43:08.284]  If you cut off his head, they're going to have a power vacuum and someone else is going to have to make sure that the deals get done for all of the energy resources in that region.
[02:43:08.664 --> 02:43:16.427]  And if Iran can't play around with the Suez Canal, choking off other countries for oil and stuff, even though they're getting their money from Russia and China.
[02:43:18.187 --> 02:43:20.648]  So what do you think is going to happen in the endgame?
[02:43:20.808 --> 02:43:22.429]  Lobos are trying to bring down the U.S.
[02:43:22.449 --> 02:43:23.629]  Trump's trying to stabilize it.
[02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:26.650]  I think he means well, but this is a gamble.
[02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:28.170]  Gutt Lobo, he's not a smart guy.
[02:43:28.451 --> 02:43:29.691]  How do you think this is going to end?
[02:43:31.281 --> 02:43:38.729]  Um, we're going to look at a boiling point, but it's not going to pop off until something more internal crisis here in America happens.
[02:43:39.269 --> 02:43:41.732]  And that's the bigger concern that I'm worried about.
[02:43:42.092 --> 02:43:52.163]  The bigger concern is when we start having biological problems with this virus outbreak here in America, or, and, you know, the Virginia situation with gun confiscation coming up and
[02:43:53.115 --> 02:43:58.197]  I hate saying this, but China and Russia, they're just biding their time, and gold is getting really valuable.
[02:43:58.257 --> 02:43:59.457]  It's all bought out in Germany.
[02:43:59.537 --> 02:44:00.617]  I understand that.
[02:44:00.637 --> 02:44:00.897]  That's right.
[02:44:00.917 --> 02:44:08.580]  They're trying to plunge the economy, and we want to warn people, but then if the economy goes down, then it only helps the globalists.
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:10.461]  One hell of a time, 2020.
[02:44:10.721 --> 02:44:11.242]  So critical.
[02:44:11.282 --> 02:44:12.143]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:44:12.163 --> 02:44:12.743]  Amazing call.
[02:44:13.064 --> 02:44:16.187]  By the way, we're going to get to all these calls because Owen Schroeder is coming up on the same phone board.
[02:44:16.467 --> 02:44:19.630]  He's going to go right to them and we don't get to you right now, but I'm going to get to more here in a second.
[02:44:20.010 --> 02:44:22.032]  Syrian girl, what do you want to say about what he just broke down?
[02:44:22.333 --> 02:44:24.275]  Because I know that ISIS and Al-Qaeda have said,
[02:44:24.855 --> 02:44:27.496]  That they are trying to bring Ebola in and weaponize it.
[02:44:27.516 --> 02:44:31.797]  I know the Democrats in Soros are personally bringing in thousands a week to Texas alone.
[02:44:32.117 --> 02:44:33.537]  The Border Patrol can't even stop them.
[02:44:33.577 --> 02:44:34.637]  Federal judges let them go.
[02:44:34.677 --> 02:44:36.138]  They go, I don't want you tested.
[02:44:36.158 --> 02:44:36.418]  Boom.
[02:44:37.038 --> 02:44:38.638]  Illegal aliens can shoot women in the back.
[02:44:38.678 --> 02:44:39.979]  In California, juries let them go.
[02:44:40.019 --> 02:44:40.939]  They go, gee, why?
[02:44:41.179 --> 02:44:41.479]  Kill them.
[02:44:41.539 --> 02:44:44.360]  I mean, the left is in a war against America right now.
[02:44:44.420 --> 02:44:45.020]  It's insane.
[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:49.681]  And so that's why we just hope Trump can, you know, not be manipulated.
[02:44:49.701 --> 02:44:50.161]  What do you think?
[02:44:52.229 --> 02:44:57.573]  I'd like to make a comment about all of the colours, if that's okay, if we have time.
[02:44:57.593 --> 02:44:58.093]  Go ahead.
[02:44:58.113 --> 02:45:00.835]  The last one about Africa.
[02:45:01.695 --> 02:45:16.825]  There is a story that I heard that the Free Syrian Army or Al-Qaeda-linked militias were being transported to North Africa, Libya, because Turkey, which funds these Free Syrian Army militias,
[02:45:17.465 --> 02:45:20.248]  It's actually declared war and is going into Libya now.
[02:45:20.629 --> 02:45:25.334]  So that's what I've heard, that they've taken some of those guys and they've switched them into theirs.
[02:45:25.614 --> 02:45:27.336]  Turkey did just vote to basically invade Libya.
[02:45:33.007 --> 02:45:44.373]  Yes, but I haven't heard about the Congo thing, because I think it would be difficult to carry that out, because Syrians look like me, or me with a darker tan.
[02:45:45.674 --> 02:45:52.677]  A thousand Syrians in the Congo would stand out, so I don't see how that would happen unless they were dressed up as aid workers.
[02:45:53.318 --> 02:45:55.459]  I haven't heard about that, so I can't comment on it.
[02:45:55.839 --> 02:45:59.160]  Well, we know there's Al Shabaab and all that, but you're right, those are mainly Africans.
[02:45:59.700 --> 02:46:00.460]  All right, thank you.
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:02.481]  That's a great angle on that.
[02:46:02.881 --> 02:46:04.081]  Who's been holding the longest now?
[02:46:05.461 --> 02:46:06.381]  Josh in West Virginia.
[02:46:06.401 --> 02:46:06.942]  You're a trooper.
[02:46:06.982 --> 02:46:07.942]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:46:08.222 --> 02:46:09.482]  Good to talk to you in the year 2020.
[02:46:11.103 --> 02:46:12.363]  Yeah, it's great to talk to you, Alex.
[02:46:12.383 --> 02:46:14.863]  I'm a little sick, so don't mind my voice breaking up.
[02:46:17.224 --> 02:46:20.965]  I was just going to talk about stuff that happened in Iran.
[02:46:20.985 --> 02:46:25.386]  I was thinking that maybe China, Iran,
[02:46:26.260 --> 02:46:35.664]  Deep State was all intertwined and trying to throw Trump off and make him look weak right before going into this first phase of the trade deal.
[02:46:35.984 --> 02:46:36.225]  Yes.
[02:46:37.765 --> 02:46:41.907]  And maybe there's some more facets to it, but I'll let you get to the other callers.
[02:46:41.927 --> 02:46:42.647]  No, no, no, no.
[02:46:42.868 --> 02:46:43.668]  That's a great point.
[02:46:43.928 --> 02:46:49.311]  From your perspective, and this makes Trump look stronger, the Democrats in Deep State are very upset right now.
[02:46:50.011 --> 02:46:52.832]  I think they were planning to manipulate this and get this a lot bigger.
[02:46:53.032 --> 02:46:54.553]  But I also see Syrian girl's perspective.
[02:46:56.351 --> 02:46:57.932]  Yeah, I do too.
[02:46:59.052 --> 02:47:01.954]  I see about 10 different ways it could have went down.
[02:47:03.634 --> 02:47:16.621]  Maybe Trump spoke to or had somebody speak to this guy that they smited, the Iranian terror general, and they kind of dealt him a card to see which way he'd play it.
[02:47:17.761 --> 02:47:19.162]  I don't think he played it the right way.
[02:47:20.226 --> 02:47:22.367]  Oh, you know, absolutely, you know that happened.
[02:47:22.987 --> 02:47:23.448]  Absolutely.
[02:47:23.468 --> 02:47:29.891]  Well, my gut level, and then I talked to some folks that are hooked in pretty good, and they said that's what they've heard.
[02:47:30.331 --> 02:47:35.734]  This is really a message to Obama and the deep state and everybody, I mean, that Trump's going to start killing people.
[02:47:36.594 --> 02:47:44.458]  Because this guy was double dealing with neocons and everybody as well, and I don't think anybody expected him to just ignore the advisers and just kill this guy.
[02:47:45.418 --> 02:47:46.839]  Because, you know, Bolton's like, I want war.
[02:47:46.879 --> 02:47:47.820]  I want to bomb Tehran.
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:48.580]  War, war, war.
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:50.602]  Trump goes, here, we'll just kill the head of Iran.
[02:47:50.622 --> 02:47:52.163]  Because the guy runs Iran.
[02:47:52.183 --> 02:47:54.885]  So it's a big deal.
[02:47:55.186 --> 02:47:55.606]  Thank you, sir.
[02:47:55.646 --> 02:47:57.247]  Great points.
[02:47:57.447 --> 02:48:00.650]  That's the other perspective here, is that Trump wants folks to know he means business.
[02:48:03.018 --> 02:48:08.463]  Well, yeah, this is the big escalation and that would certainly show the world that he means business.
[02:48:08.523 --> 02:48:12.226]  But at the same time, it also wasn't the business he's in.
[02:48:12.626 --> 02:48:14.728]  It's the business of war, unfortunately.
[02:48:14.748 --> 02:48:24.076]  It's the business of keeping soldiers in the Middle East perpetually to get Raytheon and all of these weapons contractors money and to make these deals.
[02:48:24.156 --> 02:48:26.478]  I mean, you know, this is all unnecessary.
[02:48:27.775 --> 02:48:40.626]  Also, what we're being told here is the same lies we've been told in the past, that we're going to be greeted as liberators, that Iraqis are—Pompeo said Iraqis are celebrating this assassination, and Iranians too.
[02:48:41.026 --> 02:48:47.892]  The fact is that Iraqis, you know, they were holding up his posters on the street in the video that Pompeo posted.
[02:48:47.932 --> 02:48:52.977]  They were holding up pictures of the Shiite ayatollahs that were assassinated.
[02:48:53.413 --> 02:48:56.034]  And as well as that, you know, they've been chanting anti-U.S.
[02:48:56.114 --> 02:49:01.175]  chants now, you know, around Karbala, which was a, you know, a Shiite city.
[02:49:01.575 --> 02:49:08.237]  So, this is not a, this is an escalation, you know, this is aggression.
[02:49:08.257 --> 02:49:09.458]  You're absolutely right.
[02:49:11.318 --> 02:49:14.400]  Soleimani was hated in a lot of the Arab world and seen as a boogeyman.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:16.601]  I don't normally agree with Atlantic Monthly.
[02:49:16.641 --> 02:49:20.783]  But in Saudi Arabia, of course, you know, the Saudis definitely hated him.
[02:49:22.004 --> 02:49:24.766]  He destroyed their ISIS and their Al-Qaeda as well.
[02:49:25.206 --> 02:49:25.586]  So, yeah.
[02:49:25.626 --> 02:49:28.988]  Listen, I don't know why you haven't been on the show in a while.
[02:49:29.408 --> 02:49:31.489]  And whoever told you I don't like having you on the show is wrong.
[02:49:31.509 --> 02:49:32.430]  I don't know who told you that.
[02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:34.512]  I want to get you back on the show on a routine basis.
[02:49:34.532 --> 02:49:37.255]  Please join us again next week and we really appreciate you.
[02:49:37.275 --> 02:49:39.036]  People can get your perspective on things.
[02:49:39.076 --> 02:49:40.838]  It's very, very thought-provoking.
[02:49:41.138 --> 02:49:42.320]  At Partisan Girl on Twitter.
[02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:44.041]  And we really appreciate you joining us.
[02:49:44.081 --> 02:49:44.422]  Thank you.
[02:49:45.643 --> 02:49:46.364]  Thank you so much.
[02:49:50.083 --> 02:49:52.163]  There's not time to go to Baldy, but he'll be up first.
[02:49:53.084 --> 02:49:56.104]  Or Patrick, or Wildman, or Moshe, or Tony, or Gary.
[02:49:56.184 --> 02:49:57.665]  But Owen's taking calls for three hours.
[02:49:57.785 --> 02:49:58.665]  Dr. Pachinko's coming back on.
[02:49:58.685 --> 02:49:59.585]  But Owen is awesome.
[02:49:59.605 --> 02:50:00.245]  I just talked to him.
[02:50:00.525 --> 02:50:01.446]  He wants to go to your calls.
[02:50:01.866 --> 02:50:04.326]  So at like five after next hour, he'll get these calls out of the way.
[02:50:04.346 --> 02:50:05.146]  Hear what you have to say.
[02:50:05.847 --> 02:50:08.107]  And I'll be back this weekend.
[02:50:08.707 --> 02:50:11.088]  And I'll probably be co-hosting, I think, this Sunday with Owen from 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:50:12.768 --> 02:50:16.470]  And I've got some other things I'm gonna be working on here, so look for special reports throughout the evening and tomorrow.
[02:50:16.510 --> 02:50:24.233]  And if something big breaks, just like last night, I drove up here at 8.30, did research, shot a report, and it was out by 10.15.
[02:50:25.854 --> 02:50:27.174]  So, stuff happens.
[02:50:27.934 --> 02:50:28.215]  It's 1 a.m.
[02:50:30.128 --> 02:50:34.712]  And there's a war or something starts, you better believe, if I'm able, I'm in my car, driving over here.
[02:50:35.413 --> 02:50:37.034]  News Checker, just do it on the phone, do a live report.
[02:50:37.054 --> 02:50:41.718]  We can't do that anymore, but we have our own infrastructure, and we have a booster, it's you, that makes it all possible.
[02:50:41.778 --> 02:50:45.361]  Please don't forget, our big end of year sales are about to end at InfoWareShore.com.
[02:50:45.601 --> 02:50:47.183]  They make this whole thing happen, so thank you.
[02:51:00.083 --> 02:51:03.824]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:51:04.365 --> 02:51:07.606]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:51:07.866 --> 02:51:10.527]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:51:11.147 --> 02:51:14.008]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:51:14.688 --> 02:51:16.329]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:51:16.929 --> 02:51:18.390]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:51:19.010 --> 02:51:24.111]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:51:24.471 --> 02:51:32.414]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:51:32.954 --> 02:51:39.316]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:51:39.656 --> 02:51:42.457]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:51:48.928 --> 02:51:55.395]  About eight years ago, I decided to start working out harder and to start taking supplements and I lost a ton of weight.
[02:51:56.075 --> 02:52:01.601]  Then over the years, I stopped taking the supplements even though we sell them and they're super high quality.
[02:52:01.741 --> 02:52:03.743]  I just got out of the habit of taking most of them.
[02:52:04.403 --> 02:52:07.607]  Well, I hit rock bottom about six months ago.
[02:52:08.427 --> 02:52:11.731]  You can see footage here from when I was on the Joe Rogan Podcast, the biggest I've ever been, over 280.
[02:52:13.487 --> 02:52:20.472]  And then about four months ago, I made the decision to start taking supplements and I've almost lost 40 pounds.
[02:52:20.572 --> 02:52:24.595]  But the best part is my clarity and my focus and how much better my brain's working.
[02:52:25.276 --> 02:52:31.480]  And quite frankly, my wife is very, very pleased because let's just say I'm even more frisky than ever and extremely virile.
[02:52:31.740 --> 02:52:35.363]  I'm always virile, but I'm more virile than when I was 17 years old, 18 years old.
[02:52:36.744 --> 02:52:38.005]  These products are amazing.
[02:52:38.185 --> 02:52:42.029]  Give yourself the gift of health and it helps fund the InfoWar.
[02:52:42.369 --> 02:52:46.814]  Go to InfoWarStore.com and get some of the amazing products that have really helped me and so many others.
[02:52:46.974 --> 02:52:47.935]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:52:48.255 --> 02:52:48.755]  Take action.
[02:52:59.229 --> 02:53:01.230]  There is an opposite and equal reaction.
[02:53:02.070 --> 02:53:14.017]  Infowars has never been more effective, more devastating when it comes to exposing the globalist agenda and putting out countervailing talking points that challenge the deceptive New World Order agenda.
[02:53:14.057 --> 02:53:17.058]  And ladies and gentlemen, those successes are due to you.
[02:53:17.158 --> 02:53:18.719]  And listen, I know you don't want the credit.
[02:53:18.759 --> 02:53:19.940]  You just want to live in a free country.
[02:53:19.960 --> 02:53:21.100]  You want to live in a free world.
[02:53:21.140 --> 02:53:22.021]  You want to stand up against evil.
[02:53:22.081 --> 02:53:24.402]  But you need to recognize, without you,
[02:53:24.482 --> 02:53:26.623]  Your word of mouth and your support, we're done.
[02:53:26.743 --> 02:53:28.685]  And we need that support now more than ever.
[02:53:28.765 --> 02:53:34.228]  So do your shopping at InfoWarsTore.com right through Christmas and right into the new year and into the future.
[02:53:34.288 --> 02:53:38.510]  And continue to please spread the word because everybody else is getting censored and shut down.
[02:53:38.611 --> 02:53:44.554]  Almost nobody else had their own platforms so that when they got shut off all these other media systems, they'd still be on the air.
[02:53:44.654 --> 02:53:47.296]  We are because of you at Band.Video.
[02:53:47.776 --> 02:53:48.056]  I think so.
[02:54:05.461 --> 02:54:10.284]  And yes, InfoWars is out there championing and fighting and having a great effect.
[02:54:10.864 --> 02:54:19.909]  But we are going to be driven into the ground in the next year and won't be here in the future if you don't financially support us right now.
[02:54:20.049 --> 02:54:24.572]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and take advantage of the 12 days of Christmas while you still can.

[02:54:42.081 --> 02:54:43.001]  Taking it on the tongue.

[02:54:59.609 --> 02:54:59.990]  I think so.
[02:55:18.848 --> 02:55:20.269]  You've seen what our reporters are doing.
[02:55:20.589 --> 02:55:22.050]  You've seen how hard we're fighting.
[02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:26.692]  We need you to keep us in the game, into the future, while getting great products at the same time.
[02:55:26.772 --> 02:55:28.453]  So don't sit idly by.
[02:55:28.833 --> 02:55:31.534]  Take action now, especially if you've never tried our products.
[02:55:31.874 --> 02:55:34.976]  Or if you've tried them before, loved them, but have forgotten to buy products in a while.
[02:55:35.556 --> 02:55:41.139]  Step up to the plate and support the InfoWar today and support your own future, your own liberty, and your own destiny.
[02:55:41.219 --> 02:55:43.580]  Don't bow down to these bullies and control freaks.
[02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:48.742]  Take action, buy your war bonds, get great products at the same time at infowarestore.com.
[02:55:49.283 --> 02:55:56.366]  Charles Dickens is probably best known for penning A Christmas Carol, one of the most popular Christmas stories of all time.
[02:55:57.567 --> 02:56:04.410]  But he also wrote A Tale of Two Cities that begins with the famous passage
[02:56:05.802 --> 02:56:08.484]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
[02:56:09.264 --> 02:56:14.007]  And that's really the way to describe where InfoWars is right now.
[02:56:15.027 --> 02:56:20.831]  I've said this hundreds of times and it's been true when I said it 10 years ago and it's even more true today.
[02:56:21.831 --> 02:56:23.852]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[02:56:24.793 --> 02:56:26.854]  If people learn about it, it's because of you spreading the word.
[02:56:27.434 --> 02:56:32.677]  If we get the financial support to continue on, it's because you've decided to buy products from us or make a straight donation.
[02:56:33.778 --> 02:56:35.119]  And it's always been critical.
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:38.682]  But now it's more critical than ever.
[02:56:38.702 --> 02:56:44.345]  I'm not going to read off the whole laundry list of things that have been done to us to try to shut us down.
[02:56:45.266 --> 02:56:45.947]  It's been intense.
[02:56:46.807 --> 02:56:58.275]  And now as the final days of 2019 fade away into history, it's so critical that you do your Christmas shopping and year-end shopping at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:56:58.697 --> 02:57:02.718]  We've got really amazing top-notch products across the board.
[02:57:03.018 --> 02:57:06.139]  We've got great Patriot apparel and so much more.
[02:57:07.239 --> 02:57:14.581]  But really, folks, it's what we do on air that merits your support, not just the fact that these are great products at great prices.
[02:57:15.621 --> 02:57:25.504]  Ladies and gentlemen, if I tried to chronicle the huge stories, the game-changing information that InfoWars has put out, myself and the crew,
[02:57:26.590 --> 02:57:33.636]  Over the years, it would take hours and hours just to list the couple hundred most amazing things we've done.
[02:57:34.077 --> 02:57:40.943]  By the grace of God, and all the glory goes to God, we have done amazing things in just the last few weeks.
[02:57:42.165 --> 02:57:46.286]  We have confronted Hillary Clinton and made national headlines at point-blank range exposing her crimes.
[02:57:46.886 --> 02:57:56.669]  And we have gone and covered massive Trump rallies in the armored vehicle and taken over the narratives there and exposed the deep state crimes.
[02:57:57.069 --> 02:58:03.571]  Owen Schroer has marched in with a sea change event and confronted Nadler with the truth of his treason.
[02:58:04.411 --> 02:58:08.672]  And that has spurred so many other people to go out now and confront
[02:58:09.665 --> 02:58:12.968]  Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton and all the other globalist candidates.
[02:58:13.049 --> 02:58:13.909]  It's really amazing.
[02:58:14.770 --> 02:58:19.876]  We are the detonator that in the majority of cases
[02:58:20.865 --> 02:58:32.950]  has actually triggered other people to take action in the previous midterm election and elections before that, that have changed so many races, including getting Donald Trump into the White House.
[02:58:33.571 --> 02:58:38.493]  And so the globalists know how important we are as a populist Americana voice.
[02:58:38.933 --> 02:58:44.256]  The question is, do you know how important you are in that fight?
[02:58:44.576 --> 02:58:47.077]  Because you're not a listener or a viewer of InfoWorks.
[02:58:47.717 --> 02:58:49.378]  If you spread the word about the broadcast,
[02:58:50.316 --> 02:58:58.560]  If you say a prayer for the show, if you share the articles and videos, and if you buy the products, you are the InfoWarp.
[02:58:58.580 --> 02:59:06.665]  So I'm going to tell you again, we're having our greatest successes ever, even under massive censorship, fake lawsuits, and attacks.
[02:59:08.166 --> 02:59:08.246]  Yes.
[02:59:31.943 --> 02:59:34.004]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:34.385 --> 02:59:39.628]  Through the 12 days of Christmas, store-bought free shipping, double Patriot points, up to 75% off at cost.
[02:59:40.108 --> 02:59:41.049]  Please take action.
[02:59:41.449 --> 02:59:42.449]  Infowarsstore.com.
