[00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:28.995]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast.
[00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:38.704]  I am on the road and we just have incredible breaking news that just went live that is a global exclusive in conjunction with naturalnews.com with Mike Adams.
[00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:43.268]  He's going to be co-hosting coming up the second hour with myself and Tom Pappard.
[00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:49.214]  He'll be the main host because I wanted to be able to get to all this new evidence emerges coronavirus bioweapon.
[00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:53.705]  Might have been a Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong.
[00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:59.708]  Genes contain P-shuttle SN sequences proving laboratory origin.
[00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:02.110]  Now, why is this so important?
[00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.292]  Well, it came out a few days ago.
[00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:16.578]  It was reported on Indian newspapers on one of the most prestigious scientific medical research centers where they use computers similar to CRISPR to gene edit
[00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:24.302]  And they just came out and said, this has clearly had a bunch of other viruses welded in, including the original HIV.
[00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:29.883]  Now, the controlled corporate media didn't come out and say, oh, well, let's just dispute the paper.
[00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:33.224]  They said Zero Hedge made it up, basically.
[00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:33.924]  Okay?
[00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:41.045]  And then said that Zero Hedge had outed scientists and doctors by writing an article about who'd published a paper.
[00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:45.466]  It's like, you know, outing an NFL quarterback, you know, because you talk about him, they're a public figure.
[00:01:46.357 --> 00:01:50.199]  That's how they took, because they can call anything harassment with big tech.
[00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:51.760]  So you know right away there's a big suppression.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.623]  This paper is prestigious and it's a scan.
[00:01:57.623 --> 00:02:11.231]  So see, science allows you to create these incredibly complex bioweapons or other systems, and basically it's nanotechs, what it is, genetic nanotech, RNA nanotech, but it allows other scientists to find it.
[00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:15.213]  It basically has serial numbers on it.
[00:02:15.213 --> 00:02:22.535]  An excellent Zero Hedge article has shots, scans of the virus, the sequencing, and the pieces cut in.
[00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:30.798]  But now, they found the gene sequences in it that are only used when you're splicing, and so it's basically fingerprints.
[00:02:30.798 --> 00:02:41.982]  Now, since then, in the last few hours, they've come out and made the Indian Technical Institute pull their information.
[00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:42.262]  Pull
[00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.093]  The paper, not even saying the paper's wrong, just the paper's been withdrawn because the pressure.
[00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:50.395]  We wondered last week why the U.S.
[00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:50.975]  government, the U.N.
[00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:57.941]  and others weren't sending out the gene sequence and the scan of the virus to research labs and places that were trying to test for it.
[00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:02.664]  Because if you have that, you can then get a look at the virus and see that it's been man-made.
[00:03:02.664 --> 00:03:08.289]  So now, Mike Adams is coming on.
[00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.270]  This is all breaking out there, but no one's put the pieces together.
[00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.311]  M4 is doing it right now.
[00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:17.544]  We're now getting a really good idea that, yes, what we originally thought was probably true.
[00:03:17.544 --> 00:03:18.584]  It got out of the lab.
[00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:23.427]  The Chycoms have released the SARS, same family, four times.
[00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:25.107]  This one, we thought, got out of the lab.
[00:03:25.107 --> 00:03:26.888]  Well, yeah, it got out of the lab.
[00:03:26.888 --> 00:03:30.350]  They've been doing trials, just like the humans have been caught doing secret trials.
[00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:41.615]  There were measles and MMR vaccine trials that kill a bunch of homeless because they do it with disadvantaged populations that don't have a group to defend them, like black Americans shot up with
[00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:46.674]  Syphilis for 40-something years, being told it was vaccines in the disease experiment.
[00:03:46.674 --> 00:03:47.875]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:03:47.875 --> 00:04:01.079]  And it looks like it was a vaccine for a whole laundry list, these big unified vaccines, and that it is a vaccine experiment gone horribly, horribly wrong.
[00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.439]  Wouldn't be the first time vaccines have spread disease.
[00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.241]  Especially now they go, hey, we can gene edit these vaccines all we want.
[00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:12.966]  You can gene edit all these, you know, vaccines where they're live.
[00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:16.406]  You usually have to cut them in half or break them up or radiate them or kill them.
[00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:17.546]  But now, oh, it works better.
[00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:19.867]  It's live, but we've made it harmless.
[00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:23.828]  Like the new approved Ebola vaccine was just approved two months ago.
[00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:25.308]  Oh, it's long.
[00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:27.008]  It's harmless.
[00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:27.728]  How does it mutate?
[00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:28.268]  What does it do?
[00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.289]  What could they implant in it?
[00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:29.809]  This is crazy.
[00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:30.509]  We're going to go to break.
[00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:31.449]  We're going to lay it out.
[00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.089]  This is global exclusive stuff.
[00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:37.110]  They've wanted us off the air for just these type of months.
[00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.530]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:08.844]  It is I, the leader of Cobra, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[00:05:08.844 --> 00:05:14.828]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[00:05:14.828 --> 00:05:19.171]  But, it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:31.758]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[00:05:31.758 --> 00:05:38.322]  Anyone, once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra.
[00:05:41.593 --> 00:05:56.533]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks, and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:57.054]  Ha ha!
[00:05:57.054 --> 00:05:57.494]  Hail Cobra!
[00:06:05.317 --> 00:06:13.753]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:42.008]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday transmission.
[00:06:42.008 --> 00:06:46.230]  And time to time I come on air and I say this is the biggest news we've ever reported.
[00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.911]  Because the world is getting crazier.
[00:06:47.911 --> 00:06:49.411]  This is a quickening.
[00:06:49.411 --> 00:06:52.593]  First time I probably said biggest news I've ever reported was 15 years ago.
[00:06:53.382 --> 00:06:54.843]  Then I'd say it every once a year.
[00:06:54.843 --> 00:06:58.986]  Now I say it every few months.
[00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.927]  But I haven't said this is the biggest news I've ever reported in a while.
[00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:03.809]  This, this is right up there.
[00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:07.071]  And this is global exclusive on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:09.732]  And we've got the pieces of the puzzle.
[00:07:09.732 --> 00:07:10.773]  We know what's going on.
[00:07:10.773 --> 00:07:15.056]  And this is sensational.
[00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:21.700]  Concerning the coronavirus and just how deadly it is and its providence, where it came from and how bad it's going to get.
[00:07:22.714 --> 00:07:25.757]  But first, I want to just say something.
[00:07:25.757 --> 00:07:35.825]  I told everyone that Hillary's going to end up being put as the VP on somebody's ticket about two years ago, or that she would run right before
[00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:51.732]  The window closed for her to be able to announce and or that Hillary would be in a broker convention because there'd be too many Democrat candidates and a big battle over it because she would control the superdelegates that are still under her political control.
[00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:54.655]  They couldn't obviously have her be the nominee.
[00:07:54.655 --> 00:08:00.218]  They could have one of the candidates they choose, choose her as the VP because she would really actually be the president.
[00:08:00.218 --> 00:08:06.703]  There's this Hillary Clinton deep state cult that believes that she was going to deliver all this to her deep state cronies inside the system.
[00:08:07.506 --> 00:08:14.588]  Now that's all over the news, CNN, ABC News, it's up on Infowars.com, Zero Hedge, that's an excellent article on it.
[00:08:14.588 --> 00:08:19.569]  I told you exactly what she was going to do.
[00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:27.051]  Because I had two sources tell me what was going on with her.
[00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:33.173]  And I came on here and mentioned it some, and then I got another visit, and I was told, hey, folks want you to know this.
[00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:35.812]  People are always saying I work for the CIA.
[00:08:35.812 --> 00:08:37.292]  I have nothing to do with the CIA.
[00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:40.193]  CIA is a giant consortium, all sorts of people on it.
[00:08:40.193 --> 00:08:42.334]  It's just a government interface, the national security apparatus.
[00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:44.355]  But it was CIA that told me that.
[00:08:44.355 --> 00:08:46.996]  And they said, Hillary is horrible.
[00:08:46.996 --> 00:08:48.597]  We know you hate her.
[00:08:48.597 --> 00:08:51.058]  And she's on the phone and she's in these meetings.
[00:08:51.058 --> 00:08:52.778]  And these are the scenarios.
[00:08:52.778 --> 00:08:57.360]  And then I would go look up the scenarios they told me.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.902]  And so I'm just telling everybody, I mean, we break so much huge, massive stuff.
[00:09:00.902 --> 00:09:02.623]  That's why they want us off the air.
[00:09:02.623 --> 00:09:03.563]  It's the same thing with
[00:09:05.387 --> 00:09:13.872]  The situation with what's happening with globalism and their plans with open borders and replacement migration.
[00:09:13.872 --> 00:09:16.873]  And we got those documents over a decade ago.
[00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:22.997]  On so many fronts, we've been right there just because we're an outlet on air that will tell the truth.
[00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:31.481]  We end up getting the information from listeners and viewers and whistleblowers in corporations and in government and just in private life.
[00:09:31.481 --> 00:09:32.622]  It's all of us together.
[00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.408]  And then InfoWars makes mistakes sometimes.
[00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:45.474]  We go in, try to suss things out, try to discover exactly what's going on, but we can smell Trump's victory a mile off and forecast that.
[00:09:45.474 --> 00:10:01.222]  So it's the fact that we're so accurate and the fact that you've supported us that really upsets the system because they need these hoaxes and these outrageous things they do to happen without anybody
[00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:03.520]  Being able to question it.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:12.626]  Because if they're going to sell you a bucket of horse manure and tell you it's chocolate cake, they need to gaslight you and say, no, no, it's really good.
[00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:13.286]  It's not bad.
[00:10:13.286 --> 00:10:13.867]  Everything's OK.
[00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:20.111]  But they need to play that giant, disgusting mind trick on you.
[00:10:20.111 --> 00:10:21.732]  And that is exactly what they're doing.
[00:10:21.732 --> 00:10:30.338]  Another example, and I'm not going to toot our horn, it's just a credibility issue for the viewers, why they see me being demonized every day all across the news, is they want to inoculate you psychologically.
[00:10:31.522 --> 00:10:34.083]  To not listen to us or check out what we're saying just up front.
[00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:35.444]  Oh, that's Alex Jones.
[00:10:35.444 --> 00:10:36.484]  I don't want to be lazy.
[00:10:36.484 --> 00:10:38.725]  I'm going to look into what he actually said.
[00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:40.165]  I'm just going to believe what CNN said.
[00:10:40.165 --> 00:10:41.366]  Look what CNN says.
[00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:43.587]  Trump said he hates all Mexicans.
[00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:44.427]  They're the worst people.
[00:10:44.427 --> 00:10:46.968]  They're all criminals and scum.
[00:10:46.968 --> 00:10:47.468]  Never said it.
[00:10:47.468 --> 00:10:52.430]  I offered a million dollars on air three years ago.
[00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.312]  I said, I said, if you can find that, I will give you a million dollars.
[00:10:57.312 --> 00:10:57.872]  No one could do it.
[00:10:58.709 --> 00:11:01.330]  By the way, I've paid $100,000 prizes out before.
[00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.931]  So, I mean, we do what we say we'll do.
[00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:08.833]  I offered $100,000 that I ever said there's Martian slave colonies with humans on it.
[00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:10.154]  That was all over the national news.
[00:11:10.154 --> 00:11:12.915]  Never said anything even close.
[00:11:12.915 --> 00:11:13.736]  But that's what they do.
[00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:14.516]  Here's another example.
[00:11:15.566 --> 00:11:26.349]  We exposed Fiona Hill and we exposed McMaster with direct people that had dinner with McMaster bragging about how he was going to destroy Trump and Trump was an idiot.
[00:11:26.349 --> 00:11:28.029]  And these people were totally blown away.
[00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:29.330]  We broke that.
[00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.530]  And they came to Roger Stone in D.C.
[00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:39.792]  and said, we're going to kill you or put you in prison and tell that big, sweaty, red-faced Texan he's going to be dead.
[00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:44.129]  And we both had dinner and said, F them.
[00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:45.790]  I mean, and this was serious.
[00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.851]  People said, you're dead.
[00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:49.712]  And Roger still did the right thing.
[00:11:49.712 --> 00:11:56.835]  He's facing 20 to 52 years in prison coming up in just two weeks or so at the sentencing on the 20th.
[00:11:56.835 --> 00:11:58.556]  So I'm explaining something.
[00:11:58.556 --> 00:11:59.516]  We're real folks.
[00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:05.900]  And I know you know that, but what we're doing here is not an exercise in hype or an exercise in BS.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.361]  We're really got our nose to the grindstone.
[00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:11.970]  You've seen I've been in the field with a lot of stuff.
[00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.530]  I'm going to be out all over the country.
[00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:20.112]  Got big stuff coming up, can't tell you about yet, because this is such a historical point that we're all in right now.
[00:12:20.112 --> 00:12:36.657]  So when we come back, I'm going to do my best from the engineers, from the scientists, from the researchers, from all the people involved to lay out what's really happening.
[00:12:36.657 --> 00:12:38.798]  But let's just right now,
[00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:42.232]  State what we know.
[00:12:42.232 --> 00:12:52.776]  A major respected scientific computer gene sequencing college came out from India.
[00:12:52.776 --> 00:13:00.719]  And India, time and time again, is the country, I'm just giving them credit, that goes and tests vaccines and goes, well, why is there cancer virus in here?
[00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:01.479]  Why is this happening?
[00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:02.800]  Why is this going on?
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.881]  And they discovered that it had HIV virus delivering system.
[00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:08.102]  That's not HIV virus.
[00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:14.401]  It's the HIV virus delivery system, how it gets into the white blood cells.
[00:13:14.401 --> 00:13:18.562]  But this is the delivery system welded on to a system that goes through mucous membranes.
[00:13:18.562 --> 00:13:20.563]  So it's not HIV.
[00:13:20.563 --> 00:13:22.723]  Coronavirus doesn't have HIV.
[00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:28.065]  It has its proboscis, its teeth, its sword.
[00:13:28.065 --> 00:13:29.385]  It's dingling.
[00:13:29.385 --> 00:13:31.846]  I mean, how it gets the stuff injected into you.
[00:13:31.846 --> 00:13:34.487]  I'm sorry to use that term, but it's just dingling.
[00:13:34.487 --> 00:13:35.867]  The virus is dingling.
[00:13:35.867 --> 00:13:38.208]  So this thing has HIV's dingling.
[00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.232]  That's just a layman's term for it, but that's what it is.
[00:13:41.232 --> 00:13:43.453]  So we can joke about it all day, but it might kill your ass.
[00:13:43.453 --> 00:13:46.035]  And it was welded onto it, so it's as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:13:46.035 --> 00:13:46.876]  How long do I got to break here?
[00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:48.237]  All right, two minutes.
[00:13:48.237 --> 00:13:50.718]  We're sitting in our pants here, folks.
[00:13:50.718 --> 00:13:53.540]  So Mike Adams is coming up next hour.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.503]  Now, what's crazy is this has been proven.
[00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.585]  This is a very respected Indian institute.
[00:13:59.585 --> 00:14:04.909]  I don't have to tell folks the Indians have got some of the hottest IQs out there, especially in mathematics and things.
[00:14:04.909 --> 00:14:05.969]  Very prestigious.
[00:14:05.969 --> 00:14:08.171]  They have been forced to withdraw the study.
[00:14:09.178 --> 00:14:21.521]  Now remember, when this all broke, they were taking down medical sites, mainline scientists on Twitter, Zero Hedge, and saying, it's fake, there is no paper, the paper's fake.
[00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:24.782]  Well, then the scientists came out and said, no, this is real, it's our professors.
[00:14:24.782 --> 00:14:32.284]  Suddenly, World Health Organization gets involved, others, China gets involved, India's neighbor, they just withdrew the paper.
[00:14:32.284 --> 00:14:34.064]  They didn't say it's wrong, they withdrew it.
[00:14:35.419 --> 00:14:36.540]  They were very conclusive.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.661]  They're not usually conclusive in papers like this.
[00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:42.664]  They were conclusive because this is an iPhone.
[00:14:42.664 --> 00:14:44.706]  Don't need to be a scientist to know it, okay?
[00:14:44.706 --> 00:14:46.687]  This is a white piece of paper.
[00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:48.228]  Don't need to be a scientist to know it.
[00:14:48.228 --> 00:14:50.029]  When they scanned it, they explained the paper.
[00:14:50.029 --> 00:14:56.814]  They said, listen, this is artificially chopped into here and isn't even part of the same family of viruses.
[00:14:56.814 --> 00:14:58.655]  And so this is unprecedented.
[00:14:58.655 --> 00:14:59.756]  This is insane.
[00:14:59.756 --> 00:15:03.659]  Now, the rest of the story, as old Paul Harvey would say,
[00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:08.072]  When we come back, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:15:08.072 --> 00:15:16.678]  Since this thing broke, all the sites just asking questions about it, even before this broke, daily hack attacks, daily sabotage.
[00:15:16.678 --> 00:15:17.679]  It's happened to everybody.
[00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:20.341]  I can't even get into what's happening behind the scenes.
[00:15:20.341 --> 00:15:25.565]  We know this is huge because the effect of them trying to suppress everyone in mass
[00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:30.863]  Before we even questioned it is crazy because they know this is incredibly serious.
[00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:31.665]  It's all coming up.
[00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:32.968]  InfoWars.com.
[00:15:32.968 --> 00:15:34.090]  NewsWars.com.

[00:16:08.881 --> 00:16:09.702]  It's amazing.

[00:16:11.242 --> 00:16:19.707]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling Deep Earth Crystals Iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:21.888]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[00:16:21.888 --> 00:16:26.771]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[00:16:26.771 --> 00:16:29.153]  So just check it out for yourself.
[00:16:29.153 --> 00:16:29.613]  40% off.

[00:16:30.994 --> 00:16:31.914]  And it funds the M4.
[00:16:31.914 --> 00:16:33.115]  And then Vitamin

[00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:37.799]  Super high quality.
[00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:38.860]  Winter sun.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.662]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[00:16:40.662 --> 00:16:43.305]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:44.566]  That's why people get so sick.
[00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:45.367]  That's the main reason.
[00:16:45.367 --> 00:16:47.629]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue.
[00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:48.490]  Get higher absorption.
[00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.371]  It's amazing.
[00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:54.116]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:16:57.833 --> 00:17:00.814]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods.
[00:17:00.814 --> 00:17:03.634]  I would have storable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[00:17:03.634 --> 00:17:05.395]  The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[00:17:05.395 --> 00:17:06.155]  I hope it doesn't.
[00:17:06.155 --> 00:17:10.896]  It's incredibly dangerous and it'll cause... Well, you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant bubble pops.
[00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:16.537]  So, I've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality, it's insurance you can eat, it lasts 25 years.
[00:17:16.537 --> 00:17:20.918]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very lowest price.
[00:17:20.918 --> 00:17:22.378]  And that's my Patriot Supply.
[00:17:22.378 --> 00:17:26.799]  And then, so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private label it as

[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.461]  And they are saying that they've never sold this much food.
[00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:34.283]  They're still able, within 7 to 10 days, to ship it to you.
[00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:40.586]  If you get your orders in, on their small orders, their big orders, 7 to 10 days, it will be shipped out to you.
[00:17:40.586 --> 00:17:42.107]  If you get your order in now.
[00:17:42.107 --> 00:17:45.848]  But just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now.
[00:17:45.848 --> 00:17:50.411]  So get your orders in for high quality, storable foods right now, for all the reasons out there.

[00:19:02.456 --> 00:19:05.177]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:07.658]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[00:19:07.658 --> 00:19:11.240]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.062]  That if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.

[00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:29.415]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen.
[00:19:29.415 --> 00:19:31.056]  Fluoride's the bad halogen.
[00:19:31.056 --> 00:19:37.082]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grape.
[00:19:38.203 --> 00:19:43.206]  Eight years ago I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[00:19:43.206 --> 00:19:50.890]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com and I'm telling you folks, get it.

[00:20:01.495 --> 00:20:04.117]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:29.647]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday, February 2nd, 2020 transmission.
[00:20:29.647 --> 00:20:35.770]  Now, let me begin at the beginning and then walk through what's happened.
[00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:48.056]  And then if you add all the other little side things that are going on and the behavior of governments, they're really, really concerned about this coronavirus for a good reason.
[00:20:48.056 --> 00:20:48.736]  It's man-made.
[00:20:49.611 --> 00:20:54.335]  And the minute they saw it was man-made, the giant crapping fits began.
[00:20:54.335 --> 00:20:58.658]  Now you'll notice on Thursday and Friday, it was a big internet controversy.
[00:20:58.658 --> 00:21:03.202]  Like as Jones sold out, he's saying it's probably not that bad.
[00:21:03.202 --> 00:21:05.583]  No, I'm sold out to the truth.
[00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:10.407]  So obviously for shows or anybody to hype something up gets more viewers.
[00:21:10.407 --> 00:21:11.268]  I'm not going to do that.
[00:21:11.268 --> 00:21:11.988]  I have children.
[00:21:11.988 --> 00:21:14.430]  I try to tell the truth.
[00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.492]  I try to figure out things and then
[00:21:18.237 --> 00:21:23.761]  When I make mistakes because I'm trying to figure out what's going on, we're getting lied to most of the time.
[00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:26.784]  And I'm out here in the dark, just like you are, trying to muddle through things.
[00:21:26.784 --> 00:21:28.145]  I'm going to make mistakes.
[00:21:28.145 --> 00:21:37.772]  And when I make mistakes, they come in with a big old magnifying glass and they zoom right in on every little minutia and turn it around and say, we're doing it on purpose.
[00:21:37.772 --> 00:21:39.693]  So I don't want to say I'm paralyzed.
[00:21:39.693 --> 00:21:41.295]  That's not it.
[00:21:41.295 --> 00:21:47.019]  I've been having a bunch of guests on with different views and different angles that I respect from different angles.
[00:21:48.212 --> 00:22:03.923]  Dr. Steve Pachinick, he's a medical doctor, a great investigative journalist who works on this very intensely, Sean Rappaport, Mike Adams, but so many other people and experts we've had on to give their take and give their view on this.
[00:22:03.923 --> 00:22:10.448]  And what became clear very early was this is not a normal event.
[00:22:10.448 --> 00:22:14.411]  Now, we didn't want to say this is the big one.
[00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:15.852]  The way to say it's not the big one
[00:22:16.616 --> 00:22:25.641]  Is to say, OK, it's probably a big world health drill, a big world government drill, because the way we've seen the Russians and the Chinese and the U.S.
[00:22:25.641 --> 00:22:32.925]  lockstep the same propaganda and the way the talking points have been just the same, I've never seen this before.
[00:22:32.925 --> 00:22:37.087]  And I know they have global agreements during a world pandemic.
[00:22:37.087 --> 00:22:41.110]  To basically link up and all operate the same.
[00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.091]  And so I saw that.
[00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:45.432]  Going back over a week ago and I said,
[00:22:46.107 --> 00:22:47.188]  Well, you all heard me talk about it.
[00:22:47.188 --> 00:22:47.868]  You called in.
[00:22:47.868 --> 00:22:49.128]  Most of you agreed.
[00:22:49.128 --> 00:22:56.472]  I said, this has got to be a hoax or a majorly exaggerated because they're all in lockstep.
[00:22:56.472 --> 00:23:01.834]  But if it's real, they'd be in lockstep too.
[00:23:01.834 --> 00:23:07.697]  So then why would Trump wait more than anybody to start closing down flights?
[00:23:07.697 --> 00:23:09.077]  Now he's doing it, starting.
[00:23:09.077 --> 00:23:11.598]  He didn't want to create a panic in the stock market.
[00:23:11.598 --> 00:23:12.579]  That was our reason for that.
[00:23:13.536 --> 00:23:16.819]  And then we were calling around the top labs and checking the news.
[00:23:16.819 --> 00:23:20.842]  And normally you'd have a scan on a virus like this that's publicly available.
[00:23:20.842 --> 00:23:22.843]  You want all the clinics around there doing testing.
[00:23:22.843 --> 00:23:25.225]  They have the machines to test the virus and put it in.
[00:23:25.225 --> 00:23:27.227]  Computers do it now to be able to tell.
[00:23:27.227 --> 00:23:28.948]  So it's taken days.
[00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:30.489]  It takes hours.
[00:23:30.489 --> 00:23:33.892]  And the clinics are all like, yeah, they won't give us a scan of it.
[00:23:33.892 --> 00:23:42.618]  And instead, databases that would have it, systems that would share it, subgroups that had gotten it were suddenly being hit with giant denial of service attacks out of D.C.
[00:23:44.147 --> 00:23:51.330]  And out of Northern Virginia, and out of China, and out of South Korea, and out of Germany.
[00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.512]  But see, you can go hijack computers somewhere and do it for somewhere else, so that doesn't mean anything.
[00:23:55.512 --> 00:23:57.673]  Like somebody steals your gun and goes and kills somebody with it.
[00:23:57.673 --> 00:23:58.913]  That doesn't mean anything.
[00:23:58.913 --> 00:24:04.636]  So we're here trying to figure this out, just like you are, because we've never seen such a lockdown.
[00:24:04.636 --> 00:24:07.997]  We've never seen such hysteria in their actual action.
[00:24:07.997 --> 00:24:10.258]  But then they're telling you, oh, it's not that big a deal on the net.
[00:24:11.252 --> 00:24:23.117]  It's that mix of big, huge clampdown, tanks in the streets equivalent, China literally, bodies being burned in mass, drones flying around going, get off the streets, you know, or you'll have your carbon credit cut or whatever.
[00:24:23.117 --> 00:24:24.197]  That's going on.
[00:24:24.197 --> 00:24:29.799]  The role of the robots managing people locked up in apartment buildings.
[00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:31.900]  I mean, like, like, like, like dreidels.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.881]  Exterminate.
[00:24:32.881 --> 00:24:33.441]  Exterminate.
[00:24:34.352 --> 00:24:35.693]  Out of Doctor Who.
[00:24:35.693 --> 00:24:38.154]  But instead, they're not doing that.
[00:24:38.154 --> 00:24:39.515]  They're teaching you, don't run.
[00:24:39.515 --> 00:24:40.615]  We are your friends.
[00:24:40.615 --> 00:24:44.117]  The dreidel brings you the food.
[00:24:44.117 --> 00:24:46.578]  So, so we're just being, oh, dreidels are coming.
[00:24:46.578 --> 00:24:49.679]  They're going to be... Daleks.
[00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:50.420]  Daleks.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.201]  The Daleks are like, exterminate, exterminate, exterminate.
[00:24:53.201 --> 00:24:57.563]  They're rolling around the Chinese hotels and apartment buildings.
[00:24:57.563 --> 00:24:59.404]  And so drones are flying around.
[00:24:59.404 --> 00:25:00.665]  We'll play this next segment.
[00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:02.325]  Barking at everyone, giving orders.
[00:25:02.325 --> 00:25:03.626]  And I'm like, okay, this is a giant drill.
[00:25:04.898 --> 00:25:16.889]  But then, not just this group, but other major scientific universities come out and say, this virus doesn't look normal, doesn't look novel, like original.
[00:25:16.889 --> 00:25:18.510]  It looks like Frankenstein.
[00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.892]  You know, you're like, how do you know Frankenstein is Frankenstein?
[00:25:20.892 --> 00:25:22.334]  He's got stitches across his head.
[00:25:22.334 --> 00:25:24.135]  He's got stitches on his arms.
[00:25:24.135 --> 00:25:26.377]  He's made out of a bunch of different bodies.
[00:25:26.377 --> 00:25:28.219]  He's got, you know, some crazy person's brain.
[00:25:29.235 --> 00:25:34.656]  And so you see the syntheticness of it, and now you get this major university, highly respected.
[00:25:34.656 --> 00:25:35.977]  I mean, I went and looked this group up.
[00:25:35.977 --> 00:25:37.197]  This is what they do.
[00:25:37.197 --> 00:25:45.039]  They scan the virus, and all these top scientists are listed here, people that are creating vaccines, people that do this for a living.
[00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:46.980]  They're respected, very respected.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.301]  They go, no, this is unbelievably, obviously manufactured.
[00:25:51.301 --> 00:25:54.482]  And they said, it's sensational.
[00:25:54.482 --> 00:25:55.562]  It's sensational.
[00:25:57.728 --> 00:26:03.452]  That this has got the original mother of all HIV.
[00:26:03.452 --> 00:26:06.855]  That means everything that would mutate out of it.
[00:26:06.855 --> 00:26:09.216]  There's hundreds of types of HIV mutations.
[00:26:09.216 --> 00:26:13.980]  So if you want to always create a vaccine to counter all HIV, you go back to the grandma.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.120]  You go back to the big daddy.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.521]  You go back to the grandpa.
[00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:20.384]  You go back to the original stud line.
[00:26:20.384 --> 00:26:22.225]  Okay?
[00:26:22.225 --> 00:26:23.046]  And boom!
[00:26:23.046 --> 00:26:23.466]  There's the...
[00:26:25.663 --> 00:26:35.534]  The delivery part sliced out and another part sliced out of the virus and it's sliced in to give it teeth.
[00:26:35.534 --> 00:26:40.699]  So again, if I came through your door in full armor and a samurai sword attacking you, you'd know I came for a fight.
[00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:42.341]  That's what was happening.
[00:26:42.341 --> 00:26:46.486]  This virus was given a delivery system that isn't even part of its
[00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.812]  Genetic background or what SARS has done.
[00:26:49.812 --> 00:26:57.417]  So they took a really bad, really viral, easily spread SARS coronavirus that China's already released four times.
[00:26:57.417 --> 00:26:58.998]  They claim being an accident.
[00:26:58.998 --> 00:27:02.981]  Probably again, vaccine tests they've done to see what it does to the population.
[00:27:02.981 --> 00:27:06.243]  We know that's happened with H1N1 here before.
[00:27:06.243 --> 00:27:10.146]  We know this is going on in mass experimentation to see how these vaccines work.
[00:27:10.146 --> 00:27:14.749]  And so, oh, it's happened again, but then people get it and they go, what the hell?
[00:27:14.749 --> 00:27:15.770]  This has got
[00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:25.875]  HIV delivery system that plugs into a T-lymphocyte white blood cell and injects itself in the protein cell membrane to get through.
[00:27:25.875 --> 00:27:29.116]  But see, this doesn't inject into a white blood cell, thank God.
[00:27:29.116 --> 00:27:34.499]  It injects through mucous membrane to get into your body.
[00:27:34.499 --> 00:27:38.780]  So it's meant to get in through your nose, or get in through your mouth, or get in through your eyes.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:44.823]  So this is it, ladies and gentlemen, and it's absolutely massive what does all that point towards and what now the left
[00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:46.069]  Ian.
[00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:17.396]  Uh, there's new evidence for this front of our weapon.
[00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:19.959]  Uh, might have been a Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong.
[00:28:19.959 --> 00:28:24.666]  Genes contain pea shuttle as tick-proving laboratory origin and victory.
[00:28:25.427 --> 00:28:31.009]  Proven laboratory origin by having the P Shuttle-SNG.
[00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:33.430]  That's the big call here.
[00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:34.291]  It's the big one.
[00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:36.192]  We'll be right back to think about that.
[00:28:36.192 --> 00:28:41.154]  It's major scientific groups coming out going, no, it's got, it's P Shuttle-SN.
[00:28:41.154 --> 00:28:42.895]  It's, it's, it's slapdash.
[00:28:42.895 --> 00:28:47.196]  So just let it out on purpose or was it escaped?
[00:28:47.196 --> 00:28:48.037]  Was it an accident?
[00:28:48.037 --> 00:28:49.137]  Was it a bad change?
[00:28:49.137 --> 00:28:50.478]  We break it all down straight ahead.
[00:28:50.478 --> 00:28:50.918]  Stay with us.
[00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:59.111]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:28:59.111 --> 00:29:05.398]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're gonna sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[00:29:05.398 --> 00:29:16.250]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's fortified with colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free.
[00:29:17.219 --> 00:29:18.960]  The adult or the children's.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.522]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[00:29:22.522 --> 00:29:23.422]  People love it.
[00:29:23.422 --> 00:29:31.547]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[00:29:32.307 --> 00:29:35.069]  Then it has the patented silver saw.
[00:29:35.069 --> 00:29:37.791]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause gingivitis.
[00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:38.612]  This is all proven.
[00:29:38.612 --> 00:29:40.153]  You can make claims with this.
[00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:51.341]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[00:29:51.341 --> 00:29:52.702]  So, we're really proud of it.
[00:29:52.702 --> 00:29:53.623]  It funds the operation.
[00:29:53.623 --> 00:29:55.324]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:29:55.324 --> 00:29:56.986]  That's why we're still on air thanks to you!
[00:29:58.271 --> 00:30:02.393]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[00:30:02.393 --> 00:30:04.294]  You don't want my thanks.
[00:30:04.294 --> 00:30:10.518]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[00:30:10.518 --> 00:30:11.418]  And you know what?
[00:30:11.418 --> 00:30:14.740]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.082]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to
[00:30:21.328 --> 00:30:29.410]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists, because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:37.512]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are the Infowar, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[00:30:37.512 --> 00:30:46.215]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[00:30:47.256 --> 00:30:48.878]  You have made history.
[00:30:48.878 --> 00:30:50.100]  We have made history together.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:55.347]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[00:30:55.347 --> 00:30:57.751]  And I suggest you use it.
[00:30:57.751 --> 00:31:00.875]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of Infowars.
[00:31:01.894 --> 00:31:12.282]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[00:31:12.282 --> 00:31:19.027]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[00:31:19.807 --> 00:31:29.556]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[00:31:29.556 --> 00:31:32.239]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[00:31:33.097 --> 00:31:38.258]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[00:31:38.258 --> 00:31:43.220]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.600]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:51.382]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[00:31:51.382 --> 00:31:53.362]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[00:31:53.362 --> 00:31:56.463]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[00:31:57.782 --> 00:31:59.484]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[00:31:59.484 --> 00:32:01.607]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroeder.
[00:32:01.607 --> 00:32:03.349]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[00:32:03.349 --> 00:32:05.112]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:32:05.112 --> 00:32:10.458]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[00:32:10.458 --> 00:32:12.321]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:13.622]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[00:32:13.622 --> 00:32:14.363]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:32:15.376 --> 00:32:16.837]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[00:32:16.837 --> 00:32:19.539]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[00:32:19.539 --> 00:32:20.680]  I don't want them to win.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.603]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[00:32:23.603 --> 00:32:26.725]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[00:32:26.725 --> 00:32:29.888]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[00:32:29.888 --> 00:32:33.691]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[00:32:33.691 --> 00:32:35.252]  These will change your life.
[00:32:35.252 --> 00:32:36.674]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[00:32:36.674 --> 00:32:38.675]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[00:32:38.675 --> 00:32:39.376]  Check it all out.
[00:32:39.376 --> 00:32:41.317]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[00:32:41.317 --> 00:32:43.099]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[00:32:43.099 --> 00:32:44.280]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.322]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:22.481 --> 00:33:26.363]  And we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday transmission.
[00:33:26.363 --> 00:33:31.647]  I am on the road working on major breaking news and information, and I will be here throughout the week.
[00:33:31.647 --> 00:33:33.888]  Paul Watson is going to be guest hosting.
[00:33:33.888 --> 00:33:35.689]  Mike Adams is going to be guest hosting.
[00:33:35.689 --> 00:33:38.511]  We also have Tom Pappert guest hosting.
[00:33:38.511 --> 00:33:46.476]  Now, Mike Adams, who's been proven dead on during this whole fiasco with the coronavirus,
[00:33:47.862 --> 00:33:50.263]  is going to be on hosting the second hour.
[00:33:50.263 --> 00:33:53.444]  Tom Pafford will be popping in as well.
[00:33:53.444 --> 00:33:58.206]  And I've already gone over a lot of this, but let me just sum it up right now.
[00:33:58.206 --> 00:34:07.490]  There's a big article up on Infowars.com that shows the breaking news and has the full article with the videos and all the links.
[00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:16.053]  And in the headline, it deals with the fact that the origin of the virus has been discovered.
[00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:16.814]  That's right.
[00:34:16.814 --> 00:34:17.474]  And it's man-made.
[00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:30.392]  Now, last week, one of the top Indian universities that does this, scanned it with their computers, and they've got gene editing systems now, where they're not just able to scan stuff, they can go and do whatever they want.
[00:34:30.392 --> 00:34:32.192]  Think about the magnitude of that.
[00:34:32.192 --> 00:34:34.813]  They can go in at the microscopic level and even change things.
[00:34:34.813 --> 00:34:40.714]  And they said, yeah, no, this is as clear as a clear blue sky.
[00:34:40.714 --> 00:34:45.935]  And this has had the HIV delivery system
[00:34:47.003 --> 00:34:48.964]  The injection system.
[00:34:48.964 --> 00:34:50.264]  It's not HIV.
[00:34:50.264 --> 00:34:52.045]  I want to be clear about that.
[00:34:52.045 --> 00:34:54.406]  The media is already trying to spin that.
[00:34:54.406 --> 00:34:56.227]  It's not HIV.
[00:34:56.227 --> 00:35:03.069]  It's like when you go to the store and let's say you've got to take some type of injection.
[00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:04.390]  Let's say like insulin.
[00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:08.691]  You get your insulin and you get your little needle and injector.
[00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:09.892]  And I know the audience knows this.
[00:35:09.892 --> 00:35:11.372]  I'm not patronizing you.
[00:35:11.372 --> 00:35:12.353]  I'm not talking down.
[00:35:12.353 --> 00:35:13.213]  There are some people
[00:35:14.887 --> 00:35:17.668]  That'll be panicked by this, so I want to be totally clear.
[00:35:17.668 --> 00:35:20.790]  It's not HIV and the coronavirus.
[00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.832]  It's the needle and plunger and injector.
[00:35:24.832 --> 00:35:27.454]  Like, it's not the mosquito.
[00:35:27.454 --> 00:35:28.354]  It's the proboscis.
[00:35:28.354 --> 00:35:30.395]  What's a mosquito's proboscis?
[00:35:30.395 --> 00:35:32.976]  It's its mouth with a needle on it.
[00:35:32.976 --> 00:35:36.658]  It sticks it in you, and it pumps saliva down one end.
[00:35:36.658 --> 00:35:40.600]  It liquefies the blood cells so they don't clot, and then it sucks it back up.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.581]  That's its delivery system.
[00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:43.767]  Okay, and that's why it burns.
[00:35:43.767 --> 00:35:50.130]  It delivers acid to liquefy your blood so it can slurp it out.
[00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.051]  Well, that's a delivery system on a mosquito, proboscis.
[00:35:54.051 --> 00:36:01.213]  This is the HIV virus, original, which folks believe was one of the first major engineered viruses before.
[00:36:01.213 --> 00:36:02.594]  That's been in Congress.
[00:36:02.594 --> 00:36:03.014]  It's come out.
[00:36:03.014 --> 00:36:04.534]  They had an autoimmune weapons program.
[00:36:04.534 --> 00:36:06.175]  That's been declassified.
[00:36:06.175 --> 00:36:10.056]  They didn't call it HIV, so they go, well, we're not saying HIV's it.
[00:36:10.489 --> 00:36:24.036]  Well, there was a secret program in 1979 in New York injecting gay men with a live autoimmune virus that would shut down their immune system and let pneumonia or cancer, you know, anything kill you.
[00:36:24.036 --> 00:36:28.118]  Because you're, it's not just viruses and bacteria that white blood cells are killing.
[00:36:28.118 --> 00:36:35.421]  I mean, when cancer is spreading, they're like, but if you wanted to kill somebody, you'd kill their T-lymphocytes.
[00:36:35.421 --> 00:36:38.302]  Because the T-lymphocyte isn't just a white blood cell.
[00:36:38.302 --> 00:36:39.163]  It's the general.
[00:36:40.287 --> 00:36:47.434]  You know, in the military, a general on the front lines with a star on his hat, because that's who you want to kill.
[00:36:47.434 --> 00:36:51.738]  So, this virus kills the general.
[00:36:51.738 --> 00:37:05.150]  Well, now they've welded off the exact delivery system and put it onto this, and now, Mike Adams, break this down and read it until next hour, P Shuttle SN Sequence Proving Laboratory Origin.
[00:37:05.891 --> 00:37:13.816]  So that's the big news here that's now coming out is that you can only have that in a laboratory engineered situation.
[00:37:13.816 --> 00:37:15.757]  And so this is just so huge.
[00:37:15.757 --> 00:37:25.243]  And so the next question is, that I should be asking myself, because I mean, we're all in this together, is, wow, was this in a vaccine test gone wrong?
[00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:26.323]  That's what Mike Adams thinks.
[00:37:26.323 --> 00:37:30.246]  And he's smarter than I am at this stuff.
[00:37:30.246 --> 00:37:30.506]  Is it
[00:37:31.027 --> 00:37:32.888]  A bioweapon, some crazy group made.
[00:37:32.888 --> 00:37:35.888]  You know, it's not just governments that can do this now, or corporations.
[00:37:35.888 --> 00:37:37.889]  I mean, there's, I mean, or big corporations.
[00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:40.149]  This is becoming easier and easier.
[00:37:40.149 --> 00:37:44.831]  Some crazy eugenics, lab tech, like 12 monkeys, that thinks there's too many people.
[00:37:44.831 --> 00:37:47.912]  That's the scenario they're most worried about.
[00:37:47.912 --> 00:37:56.674]  Because, or, or, was it some test, and somebody got infected from a monkey in a test they were doing, and it got out that way.
[00:37:56.674 --> 00:38:00.315]  Is it a vaccine gone wrong in a secret trial they know goes on and happens?
[00:38:01.306 --> 00:38:02.847]  Is it a bio weapon that leaked out?
[00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:04.808]  Did a crazy person release it?
[00:38:04.808 --> 00:38:06.249]  I mean, those are the questions.
[00:38:06.249 --> 00:38:07.210]  We've got a war game.
[00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:12.953]  And then ask ourselves, why has the response been so huge?
[00:38:12.953 --> 00:38:16.255]  The response has been, this is the worst thing ever.
[00:38:16.255 --> 00:38:20.098]  The PR has been, oh, it's not that big a deal, but be careful.
[00:38:20.098 --> 00:38:23.160]  And so people have really responded.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.981]  But the article is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:25.981 --> 00:38:30.124]  Two days ago, a paper published in the bio
[00:38:31.579 --> 00:38:39.987]  Exxon Org Journal presented findings that indicated the coronavirus appeared to be engineered with key structural proteins, close quote, of HIV.
[00:38:39.987 --> 00:38:43.790]  The patents are similar to unique inserts.
[00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:45.612]  Unique inserts.
[00:38:45.612 --> 00:38:46.372]  These aren't mutations.
[00:38:46.372 --> 00:38:48.094]  These are inserts.
[00:38:48.094 --> 00:38:52.097]  In the 2019 NCOV spike protein, the HIV-1, GP-120, and GAG
[00:38:54.361 --> 00:38:58.923]  I spent 10 hours the last few days just researching what this stuff means.
[00:38:58.923 --> 00:39:08.367]  Concluded that the engineering of coronavirus with such gene sequences was likely to be of a fortuitous in nature.
[00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:16.631]  Proving strong scientific support for the theory that the coronavirus is an engineered bioweapon that escaped laboratory containment in China.
[00:39:16.631 --> 00:39:21.453]  The coverage of the paper by Zero Hedge that led to a firestorm of denials by governments
[00:39:22.276 --> 00:39:24.217]  Help authorities and CIA-controlled media.
[00:39:24.217 --> 00:39:29.661]  Not surprisingly, any suggestion that the coronavirus was engineered as a bioweapon had to be immediately eliminated.
[00:39:29.661 --> 00:39:35.004]  The prevailing panic by the establishment sought to blame the outbreak on Mother Nature.
[00:39:35.004 --> 00:39:36.585]  Bats, snakes, seafood.
[00:39:36.585 --> 00:39:37.366]  It's fun to do that.
[00:39:37.366 --> 00:39:38.587]  This is gross eating bats.
[00:39:38.587 --> 00:39:41.449]  And look, Chinese folks are great, but man, stop eating a lot of snakes.
[00:39:41.449 --> 00:39:45.211]  You know, I mean, just, you know, it's like in Africa where they beat the baby monkey on the head, eat the brains.
[00:39:45.211 --> 00:39:47.533]  It's come on, man.
[00:39:47.533 --> 00:39:51.015]  Rather than the human beings who are playing around with deadly biological weapons,
[00:39:51.459 --> 00:39:53.140]  That are designed to extinguish human life.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.901]  Wow, that's beautifully written.
[00:39:54.901 --> 00:40:01.426]  Yeah, none of us want to see, like, faces of death, a little monkey chained down, and they're beating its brains out, and the woman eats the brains.
[00:40:01.426 --> 00:40:02.447]  That's abhorrent.
[00:40:02.447 --> 00:40:04.128]  All cultures aren't the same.
[00:40:04.128 --> 00:40:05.049]  Stop doing that.
[00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:17.698]  Everybody likes to bash Jews all day, but they were the ones 3,000 years ago in Leviticus, said, hey, let's stop putting kids in fires to demon gods, and stop drinking blood, and stop having sex with your sister,
[00:40:18.772 --> 00:40:19.912]  Stop eating oysters.
[00:40:19.912 --> 00:40:21.053]  Not that oysters aren't delicious.
[00:40:21.053 --> 00:40:22.053]  Sometimes they kill your ass.
[00:40:22.053 --> 00:40:27.755]  I mean, so everybody wants to go, oh, you idiot, crazy, you know, Chinese eating bat soup.
[00:40:27.755 --> 00:40:30.696]  It's easy to blame on that, but forget bat soup.
[00:40:30.696 --> 00:40:34.297]  You know, it's a thousand times more evil than bat soup.
[00:40:34.297 --> 00:40:38.198]  Plus disgusting looking, eating wings with hair on them.
[00:40:38.198 --> 00:40:39.239]  I mean, come on.
[00:40:39.239 --> 00:40:40.079]  That's degeneracy.
[00:40:41.383 --> 00:40:52.432]  What is bad is splicing things into genes and into RNA and then it releases and all the things that happen and the admitted huge history of vaccines causing damage and plagues.
[00:40:52.432 --> 00:40:57.036]  And then we're supposed to just go along with this and just cover it all up or we'll get censored.
[00:40:57.036 --> 00:40:59.818]  We'll get told to shut up.
[00:40:59.818 --> 00:41:01.379]  So that's really the big news here.
[00:41:01.379 --> 00:41:05.863]  And when we come back, we'll get into the bio, RXIV,
[00:41:09.756 --> 00:41:22.644]  Server on Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and the fact that this even got published in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, that's the main eugenics laboratory, because they're aware of all this going on.
[00:41:22.644 --> 00:41:28.748]  P shuttle essence sequence proves the coronavirus pandemic was definitely engineered in a lab.
[00:41:28.748 --> 00:41:36.613]  We'll cover that when we come back and actually read the scientific findings on this report for you on the other side.
[00:41:36.613 --> 00:41:37.394]  But as we go to break,
[00:41:38.487 --> 00:41:40.468]  I cannot tell you enough.
[00:41:40.468 --> 00:41:54.432]  I sell high-quality, storable foods because I believe we should all be prepared and be self-sufficient and be able to shelter in place so the virus doesn't get in our house or other viruses, like this is why I've got guns, why I've got food.
[00:41:54.432 --> 00:41:57.093]  And I have the best nano-silver that the U.S.
[00:41:57.093 --> 00:41:57.873]  military uses.
[00:41:57.873 --> 00:42:00.874]  We showed those restricted documents just a few days ago.
[00:42:00.874 --> 00:42:04.335]  I was authorized to by folks.
[00:42:04.335 --> 00:42:05.275]  Congress released it to us.
[00:42:05.782 --> 00:42:07.323]  And I'm going to tell you the military released it to us.
[00:42:07.323 --> 00:42:08.364]  They're like big fans.
[00:42:08.364 --> 00:42:15.208]  They're like, hey, Alex, you sell the only nano silver out there that we've actually secretly said kills the SARS virus and stuff.
[00:42:15.208 --> 00:42:16.929]  And I'm like, that's real stuff I showed on air.
[00:42:16.929 --> 00:42:18.110]  That's like real.
[00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.151]  So I didn't jack up the price on all that.
[00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:21.132]  You need it.
[00:42:21.132 --> 00:42:22.152]  It funds our operations.
[00:42:22.152 --> 00:42:24.454]  So get your immune gargle in three different sizes.
[00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:27.636]  It'll be sold out in a week or less and get the high quality storable foods.
[00:42:27.636 --> 00:42:31.138]  A lot of storable foods companies have already sold out because government's buying it all up.
[00:42:31.138 --> 00:42:32.339]  We're still selling it.
[00:42:32.339 --> 00:42:34.220]  They're at the same price and we're actually delivering it.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.681]  You're my patron supply.
[00:42:35.681 --> 00:42:36.722]  Infowarshore.com.
[00:42:36.722 --> 00:42:37.843]  Get four a week.
[00:42:37.843 --> 00:42:41.105]  Get three months and more at Infowarshore.com.
[00:42:41.105 --> 00:42:45.248]  And it's insurance you can eat, peace of mind, and it funds the Infowar.
[00:42:45.248 --> 00:42:47.950]  Get prepared, know you're ready, and fund the Infowar.
[00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:48.691]  A 360 win.
[00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:49.171]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:57.475 --> 00:42:58.256]  Well, it's here.
[00:42:58.256 --> 00:42:59.196]  The year 2020.
[00:42:59.196 --> 00:43:01.178]  World governments out in the open.
[00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:05.622]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[00:43:05.622 --> 00:43:08.985]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place.
[00:43:08.985 --> 00:43:14.229]  It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America.
[00:43:14.229 --> 00:43:15.130]  And guns.
[00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:15.850]  And freedom.
[00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:16.691]  And Jesus.
[00:43:16.691 --> 00:43:17.532]  And the family.
[00:43:17.532 --> 00:43:19.473]  And the protection of the unborn.
[00:43:19.473 --> 00:43:19.654]  Wow.
[00:43:20.234 --> 00:43:21.735]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[00:43:21.735 --> 00:43:23.035]  The New World Order's real.
[00:43:23.035 --> 00:43:24.096]  Satanism's real.
[00:43:24.096 --> 00:43:25.437]  The pedophile elite are real.
[00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:29.279]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[00:43:29.279 --> 00:43:34.021]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[00:43:34.021 --> 00:43:37.583]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[00:43:37.583 --> 00:43:41.885]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[00:43:42.185 --> 00:43:44.607]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[00:43:44.607 --> 00:43:45.929]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:43:45.929 --> 00:43:48.911]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[00:43:48.911 --> 00:43:56.038]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of mportshore.com is critical.
[00:43:56.038 --> 00:43:56.839]  So please take action.
[00:43:59.147 --> 00:44:04.789]  Folks, once you need the food, once you need the water filters, once you need the masks, it'll be too late to get them.
[00:44:04.789 --> 00:44:10.072]  You gotta get them now before you find that you require them for survival.
[00:44:10.072 --> 00:44:13.533]  Trust us, this is not something to be messing around with.
[00:44:13.533 --> 00:44:20.716]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com, make your purchase today, and at least have that part of survival covered.
[00:44:21.236 --> 00:44:27.581]  The food, the time it will take for the rest of society to collapse or calm down or whatever the case may be.
[00:44:27.581 --> 00:44:30.583]  The RZ Air Filtration Mask M2 Mesh.
[00:44:30.583 --> 00:44:31.944]  I have one of those personally.
[00:44:31.944 --> 00:44:35.387]  I've got a couple of these things off the old InfoWars store.
[00:44:35.387 --> 00:44:36.327]  I am prepared.
[00:44:36.327 --> 00:44:36.668]  Are you?
[00:44:36.668 --> 00:44:39.690]  If you're not, InfoWarsStore.com on sale now.
[00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.392]  Everything you need to prepare yourself for whatever comes next, folks.
[00:44:42.392 --> 00:44:44.514]  It's not necessarily the disease.
[00:44:44.514 --> 00:44:46.795]  It's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[00:44:46.795 --> 00:44:50.398]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for.
[00:44:50.618 --> 00:44:52.139]  Food will be off the shelves.
[00:44:52.139 --> 00:44:53.219]  Water won't be available.
[00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:54.900]  You might not even be able to leave your house.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:59.363]  You gotta be prepared before it comes down.
[00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:07.747]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[00:45:07.747 --> 00:45:09.208]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[00:45:10.029 --> 00:45:17.393]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[00:45:17.393 --> 00:45:24.896]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[00:45:24.896 --> 00:45:33.721]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[00:45:33.721 --> 00:45:38.223]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist.
[00:45:39.181 --> 00:45:39.781]  This hard.
[00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:43.682]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[00:45:43.682 --> 00:45:54.305]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[00:45:54.305 --> 00:45:56.986]  So visit infowarsstore.com today.
[00:45:58.536 --> 00:46:06.240]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China and the food supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:15.664]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States west coast.
[00:46:15.664 --> 00:46:20.747]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already run out
[00:46:21.707 --> 00:46:24.049]  That's right.
[00:46:24.049 --> 00:46:30.633]  The rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[00:46:30.633 --> 00:46:36.397]  Infowars, private labels from MyPatriotSupply, and ships right out of the very same factory.
[00:46:36.397 --> 00:46:41.560]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's gonna run out probably in a few weeks.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:30.704 --> 00:47:32.766]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:47:32.766 --> 00:47:36.049]  I'm going to be joined here by Mike Adams in about six minutes.
[00:47:36.049 --> 00:47:37.270]  He's going to take over.
[00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:43.916]  I'll be wagging in the wings, but this is so important that I'm going to jump in if I don't just turn the microphone off.
[00:47:44.634 --> 00:47:46.454]  Because he's an engineer.
[00:47:46.454 --> 00:47:50.495]  He has a biotesting and viral testing and chemical testing lab.
[00:47:50.495 --> 00:47:52.475]  He has people employed that do this.
[00:47:52.475 --> 00:47:56.936]  He is being massively demonized because he's been spot on.
[00:47:56.936 --> 00:48:01.097]  He has believed it's been released from a lab from the beginning because of the hysterical response.
[00:48:01.097 --> 00:48:02.697]  Governments weren't ready for this.
[00:48:02.697 --> 00:48:03.937]  They're very scared.
[00:48:03.937 --> 00:48:05.077]  And now the evidence mounts.
[00:48:05.077 --> 00:48:13.799]  It was either injected in a vaccine trial and the vaccine mutated, which is why live vaccines are so dangerous, just because they've done gene sequencing and believe it's going to be harmless.
[00:48:15.032 --> 00:48:19.333]  Again, they approved Ebola in mid-December in the U.S.
[00:48:19.333 --> 00:48:24.174]  and they are shooting people up with a live Ebola vaccine.
[00:48:24.174 --> 00:48:26.814]  Let me just say that again.
[00:48:26.814 --> 00:48:31.035]  On December 18th, if you look it up, I'm going from memory, U.S.
[00:48:31.035 --> 00:48:39.677]  approves Ebola vaccine, not for trials, but for general use in December of last year.
[00:48:39.677 --> 00:48:40.697]  So I say two months ago.
[00:48:40.697 --> 00:48:42.658]  Yeah, it's about a month and a half ago.
[00:48:42.658 --> 00:48:44.118]  We're already into February 2nd.
[00:48:45.328 --> 00:48:48.810]  And this is just insane.
[00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:50.411]  Totally insane.
[00:48:50.411 --> 00:49:03.557]  And so I had hoped and prayed that this was just government running a drill worldwide, but now they're scared because this is a live virus.
[00:49:03.557 --> 00:49:13.822]  The top research groups are saying it's been engineered and then they're being pressured by the UN to withdraw their report and not saying why.
[00:49:13.822 --> 00:49:14.783]  It's definitely crazy.
[00:49:16.673 --> 00:49:22.741]  Under intense pressure, the authors of the original paper have now withdrawn the paper and intend to reverse it, or not, revise it.
[00:49:22.741 --> 00:49:23.402]  Excuse me.
[00:49:23.402 --> 00:49:24.944]  They're not saying why.
[00:49:24.944 --> 00:49:26.146]  Oh, we're withdrawing it.
[00:49:26.146 --> 00:49:26.827]  We're not saying we're wrong.
[00:49:26.827 --> 00:49:28.088]  We're going to revise it.
[00:49:28.088 --> 00:49:33.536]  The publication that originally carried the paper now has a warning message stating, this article has been withdrawn.
[00:49:33.536 --> 00:49:34.297]  Clicker for details.
[00:49:35.416 --> 00:49:44.483]  Because Facebook fact-checkers who don't even have viral research biology degrees, who aren't doctors, they say it's not true.
[00:49:44.483 --> 00:49:46.804]  Don't scare people with HIV.
[00:49:46.804 --> 00:49:48.105]  It's not HIV.
[00:49:48.105 --> 00:49:49.606]  No one said it was HIV.
[00:49:49.606 --> 00:49:56.971]  They said it's the delivery system for HIV.
[00:49:56.971 --> 00:49:59.913]  My watch isn't time, isn't us orbiting the sun.
[00:49:59.913 --> 00:50:00.634]  It just tracks it.
[00:50:02.372 --> 00:50:03.033]  They play games.
[00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:11.882]  In addition, the publisher has posted a message warning that all science papers it posts or preliminary reports should not be recognized as inclusive.
[00:50:11.882 --> 00:50:13.784]  Well, science is that way, period.
[00:50:13.784 --> 00:50:15.766]  You're always learning more.
[00:50:15.766 --> 00:50:20.531]  Especially when the science establishment is panicked that its official narratives might be crumbling by the hour.
[00:50:21.607 --> 00:50:26.608]  No doubt the authors of the particular paper have been sufficiently threatened to revise their conclusions.
[00:50:26.608 --> 00:50:32.230]  An update of their original paper will soon be posted, effectively denounces everything they say in the original paper.
[00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.950]  And it goes on.
[00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:41.552]  But remember, the head UN scientist said the vaccines are killing people and there's a cover-up back in December.
[00:50:41.552 --> 00:50:43.092]  We got the information.
[00:50:43.092 --> 00:50:43.772]  It's been out there.
[00:50:43.772 --> 00:50:44.533]  No coverage.
[00:50:44.533 --> 00:50:45.833]  Because if you do, you get blocked.
[00:50:46.385 --> 00:50:55.270]  And it's videos of all the head scientists saying, it's hurting people, it's killing people, these adjuvants are triggering all sorts of deaths, and our doctors think it's hurting people.
[00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:56.071]  They know!
[00:50:56.071 --> 00:50:57.692]  It's a wobbly front line.
[00:50:57.692 --> 00:51:02.795]  Wobbling means next to collapse.
[00:51:02.795 --> 00:51:07.037]  Shaky, wobbly means, you know, like a boxer.
[00:51:07.037 --> 00:51:08.658]  He's wobbly.
[00:51:08.658 --> 00:51:11.000]  I mean, their own doctors know this.
[00:51:12.421 --> 00:51:14.924]  We're gonna have to have a degree to take your two-year-old and get a shot.
[00:51:14.924 --> 00:51:17.127]  And they're like, Mommy, I love you.
[00:51:17.127 --> 00:51:18.830]  Can we go to the mall after this?
[00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.412]  Or can we go see a movie?
[00:51:20.412 --> 00:51:24.437]  And like at the shot, blood coming out of your nose.
[00:51:24.437 --> 00:51:28.122]  It's like you're walking through Arizona and a rattlesnake bites you.
[00:51:29.088 --> 00:51:30.650]  Are you a medical doctor?
[00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:32.472]  Are you a venom specialist?
[00:51:32.472 --> 00:51:37.719]  No, you know your kid's leg swells up and they end up chopping their leg off because a rattlesnake bit them.
[00:51:37.719 --> 00:51:41.844]  If you're in Africa and a king cobra bites you, or India, you usually die in about five minutes.
[00:51:41.844 --> 00:51:46.851]  Now, do you go, oh, don't say a king cobra killed you because you're not a doctor.
[00:51:47.483 --> 00:51:48.944]  It's like a bee stings you.
[00:51:48.944 --> 00:51:51.025]  I used to laugh at folks who had an allergic response to bees.
[00:51:51.025 --> 00:51:51.926]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:51:51.926 --> 00:51:52.566]  Hospital.
[00:51:52.566 --> 00:51:54.647]  I finally got hit by a swarm when I was like 20.
[00:51:54.647 --> 00:51:55.628]  Now I get stung.
[00:51:55.628 --> 00:51:56.208]  I swell up.
[00:51:56.208 --> 00:51:58.310]  I gotta drink Benazryl as fast as I can.
[00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.211]  I actually have an EpiPen at my house.
[00:52:00.211 --> 00:52:01.352]  One in my car now because of it.
[00:52:01.352 --> 00:52:02.452]  Because you can't breathe.
[00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:03.133]  You're turning red.
[00:52:03.133 --> 00:52:04.894]  You're scratching all over your body.
[00:52:04.894 --> 00:52:09.597]  Imagine these babies being injected with dozens and dozens of shots.
[00:52:09.597 --> 00:52:11.578]  Everybody knows you can have an allergic response to that.
[00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.743]  The allergic response is the bare minimum.
[00:52:14.743 --> 00:52:16.164]  What else is in the shots?
[00:52:16.164 --> 00:52:17.145]  What are they hiding?
[00:52:17.145 --> 00:52:19.466]  What about the secret history?
[00:52:19.466 --> 00:52:21.707]  So Mike Adams is taking over here in a moment.
[00:52:21.707 --> 00:52:23.709]  He's going to get into all of it from start to finish.
[00:52:23.709 --> 00:52:31.373]  I'm asking him to give a whole presentation from start to finish what we know and how big this is and how serious he thinks it's about to get.
[00:52:31.373 --> 00:52:33.475]  Then tomorrow I'll be hosting with Paul Watson.
[00:52:33.475 --> 00:52:35.836]  We're going to take a lot of calls.
[00:52:35.836 --> 00:52:37.017]  P.S.
[00:52:37.017 --> 00:52:42.240]  Shuttle SN sequence proves the coronavirus pandemic was definitely engineered in the lab.
[00:52:42.941 --> 00:52:54.068]  Now certainly new evidence has emerged that proves the coronavirus was definitely engineered in the laboratory and may have been deliberately injected in the patients as part of a Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong.
[00:52:54.068 --> 00:52:58.551]  Which they again use those folks over in China as guinea pigs more than anybody.
[00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:01.433]  Don't just think it's poor folks in Appalachia and poor black folks in Alabama, do you?
[00:53:02.458 --> 00:53:18.547]  As detailed by James Lyons Welner, MD, founder of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, and author of 57 peer-reviewed publications, an analysis of the gene sequencing for coronavirus finds a particular, peculiar sequence called P-Shuttle-SN.
[00:53:18.547 --> 00:53:25.491]  This sequence is the remnant of genetic engineering sequence that was used to insert genes into viruses and bacteria.
[00:53:25.491 --> 00:53:28.933]  It's the fingerprint, the envelope of what it came from left on it.
[00:53:30.595 --> 00:53:33.157]  It provides irrefutable, open source proof.
[00:53:33.157 --> 00:53:34.719]  See, energy isn't destroyed.
[00:53:34.719 --> 00:53:36.260]  It's just transferred.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:40.143]  So, energy leaves a mark.
[00:53:40.143 --> 00:53:41.444]  They can't get rid of the fingerprints, man.
[00:53:41.444 --> 00:53:42.285]  They're not God.
[00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:43.566]  They're play God.
[00:53:43.566 --> 00:53:45.447]  Only God knows how to get rid of evidence.
[00:53:45.447 --> 00:53:51.012]  The sequence is of the remnant of the genetic engineering sequence that was used to insert genes into viruses and bacteria.
[00:53:51.618 --> 00:53:59.203]  It provides irrefutable open source, quote, proof that the coronavirus now circulating in the wind was engineered in the laboratory.
[00:53:59.203 --> 00:54:02.546]  Every lab that has the gene sequence can see this for themselves.
[00:54:02.546 --> 00:54:03.446]  It's right out in the open.
[00:54:03.446 --> 00:54:04.107]  That's why the U.S.
[00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:08.109]  government, the Chinese, won't transmit to the thousands of labs the code.
[00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:09.791]  Everybody's like, we want to test, we want to know.
[00:54:09.791 --> 00:54:12.212]  They're like, we're not giving it to you.
[00:54:12.212 --> 00:54:19.277]  Because it's got the mark on it, ladies and gentlemen, like a logo, like Budweiser.
[00:54:19.277 --> 00:54:20.378]  It's got the mark right on it.
[00:54:21.397 --> 00:54:22.618]  Bigger than Dallas.
[00:54:22.618 --> 00:54:23.918]  The Dallas Cowboys.
[00:54:23.918 --> 00:54:27.420]  You know that's the Blue Star, that silver element?
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.662]  Or the Redskins in D.C.?
[00:54:29.662 --> 00:54:30.082]  You see that?
[00:54:30.082 --> 00:54:32.163]  I mean, you know that it's Seattle Seahawks.
[00:54:32.163 --> 00:54:34.565]  Got the mark right there.
[00:54:34.565 --> 00:54:37.806]  You see some mother and father with their kid, you can tell that's their kid.
[00:54:37.806 --> 00:54:39.287]  It's got the mark right there.
[00:54:39.287 --> 00:54:42.389]  Your brain knows that's their kid.
[00:54:42.389 --> 00:54:44.110]  It knows that they look just like them.
[00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:44.750]  It's incredible.
[00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:45.631]  Mike Adams about to take over.
[00:54:46.281 --> 00:54:52.886]  One thing we can say for certain is that the particular virus has a laboratory origin, states Lyons Weller in a bombshell interview with Dell.
[00:54:52.886 --> 00:54:54.528]  Big tree of the high wire.
[00:54:54.528 --> 00:54:55.969]  The whole video's up there.
[00:54:55.969 --> 00:54:57.510]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:58.731]  It's on NaturalNews.com.
[00:54:58.731 --> 00:55:04.016]  And they are hacking and trying to savage us with mass attacks that are bigger than we've ever had.
[00:55:04.016 --> 00:55:04.796]  And we're just used to us.
[00:55:04.796 --> 00:55:08.319]  We're like, yeah, we're under mass attack, like soldiers who have been at war a long time.
[00:55:08.319 --> 00:55:09.660]  Yeah, mortars are blowing up.
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.061]  There's dead bodies everywhere.
[00:55:11.061 --> 00:55:12.082]  And I don't say that that tough.
[00:55:12.082 --> 00:55:14.684]  I'm saying I've kind of gotten where I'm punch drunk here.
[00:55:14.684 --> 00:55:15.525]  But I want listeners to know,
[00:55:16.437 --> 00:55:20.060]  The attacks are 10 times what they've ever been, 20 times.
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:20.721]  It's insane.
[00:55:20.721 --> 00:55:23.223]  I can't even tell you about it on air for security reasons.
[00:55:23.223 --> 00:55:24.724]  This is the big one.
[00:55:24.724 --> 00:55:27.266]  From the attack we're seeing, you should get prepared.
[00:55:27.972 --> 00:55:29.753]  Spread the word about these videos and articles.
[00:55:29.753 --> 00:55:31.053]  That's the most important thing to do.
[00:55:31.053 --> 00:55:35.754]  And get things like the high-quality nano silver immune gargle we have that's selling out.
[00:55:35.754 --> 00:55:37.635]  I'm still discounting it 40%.
[00:55:37.635 --> 00:55:39.916]  And get the high-quality, storable food that we're ready to ship.
[00:55:39.916 --> 00:55:40.996]  They're my patriot.
[00:55:40.996 --> 00:55:41.836]  They're in our computers.
[00:55:41.836 --> 00:55:43.477]  We drop ship right through them.
[00:55:43.477 --> 00:55:45.637]  You get it first, 7 to 10 days still.
[00:55:45.637 --> 00:55:47.258]  But within about a week, they're going to be sold out.
[00:55:48.663 --> 00:55:49.023]  We're good to go.
[00:56:06.286 --> 00:56:11.550]  Then you've got the food, you've got the guns, you've got the storable water, and then your family lives.
[00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:13.171]  And I will tell you, I'm ready.
[00:56:13.171 --> 00:56:19.816]  And if I start seeing mass spread and all this, I'll broadcast from home as long as I can, because I'm not going to expose my children to this.
[00:56:19.816 --> 00:56:23.378]  I'm going to have food, I've got water, I've got solar panels, I've got it all.
[00:56:23.378 --> 00:56:28.202]  But if you don't have the money for that, understand, just have a firearm, know how to use it, and have storable food and water for the trip.
[00:56:29.176 --> 00:56:30.517]  Mike Adams is taking over right now.
[00:56:30.517 --> 00:56:34.460]  We hope that this isn't needed, but the response shows you how serious this really is.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:36.121]  Again, please take action.
[00:56:36.121 --> 00:56:38.383]  Whatever you do, your word of mouth is king.
[00:56:38.383 --> 00:56:43.067]  Tell people how you're watching and how you're listening right now, and spread the word, because what Mike Adams is about to say is critical.
[00:56:43.067 --> 00:56:45.689]  We're a minute and a half to break, but Mike Adams, take over right now.
[00:56:45.689 --> 00:56:47.070]  You are the host of the InfoWarp.
[00:56:47.901 --> 00:56:48.642]  All right, here we go.
[00:56:48.642 --> 00:56:50.985]  Thank you, Alex, for all that coverage.
[00:56:50.985 --> 00:56:52.968]  This is critical breaking news.
[00:56:52.968 --> 00:57:02.681]  In the next hour here on InfoWars.com, I'm going to bring you a detailed analysis of the new evidence that's emerged and give credit where it's due to James Lyon Wyler.
[00:57:03.081 --> 00:57:10.324]  Who has really done a genome sequencing analysis of this and found really irrefutable proof that this was engineered.
[00:57:10.324 --> 00:57:14.266]  So as of today, this is 100% a man-made virus.
[00:57:14.266 --> 00:57:17.287]  There is no natural origin of this.
[00:57:17.287 --> 00:57:21.589]  Any news organization that's reporting that this is caused by bats and snakes,
[00:57:22.189 --> 00:57:24.713]  And seafood markets, that's fake news.
[00:57:24.713 --> 00:57:26.655]  This is 100% man-made.
[00:57:26.655 --> 00:57:30.760]  Laboratory origin confirmed, and I'll explain why as we continue.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.325]  By the way, feed me the clock, guys, that would help me get to the break here.
[00:57:34.325 --> 00:57:36.307]  I don't have video at the moment.
[00:57:36.307 --> 00:57:37.529]  Or just let me know when.
[00:57:37.529 --> 00:57:38.030]  Nevertheless...
[00:57:38.797 --> 00:57:40.298]  We're going to go take a break.
[00:57:40.298 --> 00:57:40.899]  Two-minute break.
[00:57:40.899 --> 00:57:41.800]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.121]  I'm going to get right into this.
[00:57:43.121 --> 00:57:44.842]  We're going to cover it in detail.
[00:57:44.842 --> 00:57:47.625]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show Sunday Edition.
[00:57:47.625 --> 00:57:50.627]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods.
[00:57:50.627 --> 00:57:53.430]  I would have storable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:55.211]  The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:55.952]  I hope it doesn't.
[00:57:55.952 --> 00:58:00.536]  It's incredibly dangerous and it'll cause... Well, you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant bubble pops.
[00:58:00.976 --> 00:58:03.919]  I've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality.
[00:58:03.919 --> 00:58:05.120]  It's insurance you can eat.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.321]  It lasts 25 years.
[00:58:06.321 --> 00:58:10.685]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very lowest price.
[00:58:10.685 --> 00:58:12.186]  And that's my Patriot Supply.
[00:58:12.186 --> 00:58:16.570]  And then, so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private label it as...
[00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:18.432]  Infowars Select.
[00:58:18.432 --> 00:58:21.254]  And they are saying that they've never sold this much food.
[00:58:21.254 --> 00:58:24.056]  They're still able, within 7 to 10 days, to ship it to you.
[00:58:24.056 --> 00:58:31.903]  If you get your orders in, on their small orders, their big orders, 7 to 10 days, it will be shipped out to you, if you get your order in now.
[00:58:31.903 --> 00:58:35.646]  But, just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now.
[00:58:35.646 --> 00:58:40.210]  So, get your orders in for high-quality, affordable foods right now, for all the reasons out there.
[00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.652]  And it's insurance you can eat, and it funds the Infowar.
[00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:43.032]  A total 360 win.
[00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:48.235]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:48.235 --> 00:58:51.836]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:58:51.836 --> 00:58:53.597]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:58:53.597 --> 00:59:05.662]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:59:05.662 --> 00:59:10.684]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[00:59:11.444 --> 00:59:20.609]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:59:20.609 --> 00:59:25.892]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:59:25.892 --> 00:59:28.153]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:59:28.513 --> 00:59:30.234]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:59:30.234 --> 00:59:40.218]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:59:40.218 --> 00:59:42.879]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:59:42.879 --> 00:59:51.063]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:59:51.063 --> 00:59:53.724]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.741 --> 01:00:07.682]  All right, folks.
[01:00:07.682 --> 01:00:08.242]  Sunday.
[01:00:08.242 --> 01:00:11.585]  It's February 2nd, 2020.
[01:00:11.585 --> 01:00:14.587]  We know the coronavirus was man-made.
[01:00:14.587 --> 01:00:18.810]  We now have confirmation from multiple sources, multiple papers.
[01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:22.473]  The cover-up is underway, but we now know this is man-made.
[01:00:22.473 --> 01:00:29.339]  What we don't know yet is whether it was a biological weapon that was accidentally released from a lab in China.
[01:00:29.339 --> 01:00:31.941]  That seems to be one of the likely scenarios.
[01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:34.623]  Or whether it was a vaccine experiment gone wrong.
[01:00:35.123 --> 01:00:47.407]  That's the new theory that has just emerged due to the research of Dr. James Lyons-Weiler from the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge in an interview with Del Bigtree of The High Wire.
[01:00:47.407 --> 01:00:48.667]  Just a bombshell interview.
[01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:51.688]  I just saw it this morning for the first time at brighteon.com.
[01:00:51.688 --> 01:00:53.809]  I know that InfoWars is going to be covering that.
[01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:58.090]  Probably the video will be posted on band.video as well very soon.
[01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:03.412]  And in that video, we learn that there is a gene sequence that is
[01:01:04.205 --> 01:01:11.387]  Absolute evidence of the tool set that virologists use to insert genetic code into the coronavirus.
[01:01:11.387 --> 01:01:20.930]  In other words, when you do the insertion via genetic engineering of this particular pathogen, it leaves behind a tool set, an actual code of tools.
[01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:31.233]  It's like, for example, if you walk into your den, where your computer is, and someone has smashed your computer into a thousand pieces, and there's a sledgehammer on the floor.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.144]  Then you would have to assume that, gosh, someone took a sledgehammer to your computer.
[01:01:37.144 --> 01:01:41.627]  That's what's in the viral code right now, in the genomic sequence.
[01:01:41.627 --> 01:01:43.889]  Proof of the tool that was used to make the insertion.
[01:01:43.889 --> 01:01:57.158]  Or another metaphor, it's like, if you're walking along the beach, and you stumble across books that have pages that have words, and the words have sentences that make a grammatical sense.
[01:01:57.158 --> 01:02:00.781]  They spell real words in English with the alphabet.
[01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:02.611]  And it's a book.
[01:02:02.611 --> 01:02:05.132]  Then you would say that's man-made.
[01:02:05.132 --> 01:02:12.873]  You wouldn't say, oh, a bunch of bats and snakes and monkeys got together and had an orgy on a typewriter and produced this and then it got swept up on the beach.
[01:02:12.873 --> 01:02:15.854]  But that's what the mainstream media is telling you.
[01:02:15.854 --> 01:02:21.235]  They're saying that somehow this code, which I call now open source because it's out there.
[01:02:21.235 --> 01:02:22.895]  It's out there in nature.
[01:02:22.895 --> 01:02:25.536]  They're saying that this code was an accident.
[01:02:26.536 --> 01:02:30.139]  You know, that's, of course, they believe that about everything, about human origins, about the universe.
[01:02:30.139 --> 01:02:32.140]  They just, everything's just an accident.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.121]  No.
[01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:34.242]  This was engineered.
[01:02:34.242 --> 01:02:36.664]  You could say intelligently designed.
[01:02:36.664 --> 01:02:38.885]  The coronavirus was intelligently designed.
[01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:45.070]  It was engineered by an intelligent, conscious race of human beings, i.e., probably Chinese virologists.
[01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:49.514]  They were either building a bioweapon or they were building what they thought might be a better vaccine.
[01:02:49.514 --> 01:02:51.915]  Turned out to be a catastrophic mistake.
[01:02:51.915 --> 01:02:55.298]  One way or another, they allowed this to be released into the public.
[01:02:55.911 --> 01:02:57.357]  And that's what we're dealing with right now.
[01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:59.465]  It's engineered.
[01:02:59.465 --> 01:03:00.610]  Confirmed.
[01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:00.991]  Proven.
[01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:04.486]  The entire theory that this is an accident is now blown away.
[01:03:04.486 --> 01:03:05.687]  It's irrelevant.
[01:03:05.687 --> 01:03:08.510]  Any media source reporting that is obsolete.
[01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:11.532]  They have no idea what they're talking about or they don't understand the science.
[01:03:11.532 --> 01:03:15.836]  Then again, they don't even understand that carbon dioxide feeds plants, by the way.
[01:03:15.836 --> 01:03:23.802]  So why should we expect them to understand the far more complex issue of genomics and genetic engineering, virology, epidemiology?
[01:03:23.802 --> 01:03:25.323]  They have no knowledge in these areas.
[01:03:25.323 --> 01:03:29.607]  The mainstream media is scientifically illiterate and so are the so-called fact-checkers.
[01:03:29.607 --> 01:03:30.728]  They're scientifically illiterate.
[01:03:31.403 --> 01:03:36.665]  You are getting the best reporting on this right here at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:36.665 --> 01:03:41.226]  This is the best reporting in the entire media, not just the independent media.
[01:03:41.226 --> 01:03:44.087]  And by the way, Zero Hedge did a fantastic job as well.
[01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:45.127]  They got banned.
[01:03:45.127 --> 01:03:47.388]  You know, my site, Natural News, we're covering this as well.
[01:03:47.388 --> 01:03:48.849]  Dell BigTree is doing a great job.
[01:03:48.849 --> 01:03:55.971]  There are a lot of good places, but nobody's bringing it together with the live broadcast and the live coverage as InfoWars.com is.
[01:03:55.971 --> 01:03:59.052]  And that's why I'm joining today to give you this overview.
[01:03:59.716 --> 01:04:03.098]  Now, in one minute, we're going to take just a very short one-minute break.
[01:04:03.098 --> 01:04:09.122]  When we come back from that break, I'm going to go into the quotes from Dr. James Lyons Weiler.
[01:04:09.122 --> 01:04:10.123]  The evidence.
[01:04:10.123 --> 01:04:18.588]  I'm going to talk about why this is an open-source bioweapon now that will be harvested by the enemies of America.
[01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:26.193]  You can bet that right now, Iran and North Korea and other nations are sending people to collect this bioweapon.
[01:04:26.193 --> 01:04:27.774]  To get living samples.
[01:04:28.439 --> 01:04:34.341]  And to take it home so they can study it and tweak it and maybe deploy it against the United States at some future date.
[01:04:34.341 --> 01:04:38.762]  This is going to be weaponized even if it wasn't intended to be.
[01:04:38.762 --> 01:04:41.143]  Because this is out in the open.
[01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.844]  It's now open source.
[01:04:42.844 --> 01:04:46.445]  The viral code is out there and it's not going away anytime soon.
[01:04:46.445 --> 01:04:49.226]  We'll have more coverage as we return here on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:49.226 --> 01:04:49.666]  Stay with us.
[01:04:56.368 --> 01:04:59.390]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:03.973]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from rising pressure.
[01:05:03.973 --> 01:05:09.097]  That's why we worked hard to create a new formula to support your fight against stress in your hectic day.

[01:06:02.211 --> 01:06:08.914]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:08.914 --> 01:06:11.195]  It's Mike Adams.
[01:06:11.195 --> 01:06:14.036]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:19.594]  Breaking news updates on the coronavirus pandemic today.
[01:06:19.594 --> 01:06:24.195]  The number of infections has now really catapulted beyond 16,000.
[01:06:24.195 --> 01:06:26.856]  The number of deaths well above 300.
[01:06:26.856 --> 01:06:31.277]  And these are the official numbers from China that we know are being downplayed.
[01:06:31.277 --> 01:06:37.759]  The actual numbers, according to Hong Kong University scientists, their estimates as of several days ago were 75,815 infections.
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:45.522]  No doubt that number is probably six figures by today, according to those estimates.
[01:06:45.522 --> 01:06:51.885]  We now know, just to review, 100% certain this is a man-made virus, man-made origin.
[01:06:51.885 --> 01:07:07.172]  This was created in a laboratory because we have the evidence of the tools of insertion used via genetic engineering to put certain proteins into this coronavirus for some purpose that was deliberate and intelligent and driven by human scientists.
[01:07:07.788 --> 01:07:12.710]  We don't yet know whether it was a bioweapon or whether it was a vaccine experiment gone wrong.
[01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:18.632]  Either one of those scenarios is possible at this point, but it is not possible that this is of natural origin.
[01:07:18.632 --> 01:07:24.495]  So that is a bombshell that you hear first here at InfoWars.com.
[01:07:24.495 --> 01:07:27.556]  Now importantly, when a virus is out circulating in the wild,
[01:07:28.698 --> 01:07:31.239]  A virus includes its own code.
[01:07:31.239 --> 01:07:32.239]  That's what a virus is.
[01:07:32.239 --> 01:07:33.899]  It's not a living organism.
[01:07:33.899 --> 01:07:47.442]  It has fragments, sequences of DNA and RNA surrounded by proteins to help deliver it so it can really hijack your human cells and invade your cells and kind of turn your cells into a virus factory.
[01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:53.164]  So it's churning out more viruses instead of churning out, you know, human cells as it would normally do.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.962]  These are sequences that can be seen out in the public.
[01:07:58.962 --> 01:08:01.643]  I call it an open source pandemic.
[01:08:01.643 --> 01:08:13.847]  Anyone with a genetic sequencing instrument, a gene analyzer, gene sequencer, can take a sample of this and they can get the actual software printout of the gene sequences.
[01:08:13.847 --> 01:08:15.948]  They can see this for themselves.
[01:08:15.948 --> 01:08:23.031]  Any lab in the world can now run that sequence and they will be able to find the tools of genetic insertion
[01:08:23.897 --> 01:08:27.958]  Which are well known and used across virology, used across the industry.
[01:08:27.958 --> 01:08:30.198]  One of them is the P shuttle SN vector.
[01:08:30.198 --> 01:08:34.059]  There's also a 92% match with a SARS protein.
[01:08:34.059 --> 01:08:37.020]  SARS is a type of coronavirus.
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:46.902]  A 92% match with a protein sequence from SARS that now indicates this may have been a desperate effort by China to build a vaccine.
[01:08:47.774 --> 01:08:50.595]  Against SARS or against coronaviruses.
[01:08:50.595 --> 01:08:57.458]  Now this takes us back to some research from several years ago where they found that SARS vaccines were killing people.
[01:08:57.458 --> 01:09:04.020]  Because once you were injected with the SARS vaccine, you were then highly vulnerable to secondary infections.
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:16.229]  In other words, if you were immunocompromised in any way, or if you were an elderly person, you had really no ability to overcome a secondary infection.
[01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:20.972]  And you were, in fact, more likely to be killed by that secondary infection.
[01:09:20.972 --> 01:09:29.718]  Well, what if they did that, trying to leapfrog the world in vaccine research to cash in on vaccine profits?
[01:09:29.718 --> 01:09:31.680]  And then they ran a vaccine experiment.
[01:09:32.324 --> 01:09:36.988]  And this got out into the wild, and it became more infectious than they ever anticipated.
[01:09:36.988 --> 01:09:40.430]  And now the world is facing a different kind of pandemic.
[01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.732]  A vaccine gone horribly wrong, potentially.
[01:09:42.732 --> 01:09:45.394]  This is one of the two primary theories now.
[01:09:45.394 --> 01:09:53.181]  And that that vaccine may, in fact, be now weaponized and be killing people all across China.
[01:09:53.181 --> 01:09:55.983]  Now, as pointed out by Dr. James Lyons-Weiler,
[01:09:57.023 --> 01:10:05.485]  If that's the case, it may be less infectious than the bioweapon version of this, which could be good news for the rest of the world, but it's bad news for China either way.
[01:10:05.485 --> 01:10:14.607]  And with infections now spreading all across China, and even outside of China, spreading to other countries outside of China, it's very bad news.
[01:10:14.607 --> 01:10:16.347]  I want to roll a video.
[01:10:16.347 --> 01:10:18.708]  Please start that video, the first segment.
[01:10:19.577 --> 01:10:23.379]  Because this is Dr. James Lyons-Weiler talking to Del Bigtree.
[01:10:23.379 --> 01:10:27.400]  See if we can roll that video and I'll jump in when he says the most important parts.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:37.264]  It's the entire genome sequence of this virus and compared it to the entire genome sequence of all the other coronaviruses that we have data for.
[01:10:37.264 --> 01:10:44.947]  And this weird element that doesn't belong there, I found that it actually did match a vector
[01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:53.327]  Technology that was from the 1998 was the first time it was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.
[01:10:53.327 --> 01:11:01.932]  This vector technology is a mechanism by which molecular biologists insert new genes into viruses and bacteria.
[01:11:01.932 --> 01:11:07.096]  This vector technology is called a p-shuttle SN vector.
[01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:13.460]  Now it's really unusual to find a vector technology sequence in a virus that's circulating
[01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:15.453]  In humans.
[01:11:15.453 --> 01:11:23.656]  And so, naturally, one thing that we can say, I think for certain, is this particular virus has a laboratory origin.
[01:11:23.656 --> 01:11:31.779]  So we can... What you're saying is this technology is something... I'll jump in now, but that's an interview with Del Bigtree of The High Wire, and it is astonishing.
[01:11:31.779 --> 01:11:35.360]  We're going to play another segment in the next segment here on the show as well.
[01:11:36.401 --> 01:11:39.782]  Remember what he just said, that this virus is of human origin.
[01:11:39.782 --> 01:11:41.623]  It's a laboratory origin.
[01:11:41.623 --> 01:11:43.863]  No question about it, because the tool set is there.
[01:11:43.863 --> 01:11:44.644]  It's present.
[01:11:44.644 --> 01:11:45.984]  It's evident.
[01:11:45.984 --> 01:11:50.926]  It's part of the genomic sequence now, the tool set that was required to insert the genes.
[01:11:50.926 --> 01:11:57.508]  And anybody telling you otherwise is fibbing or hoaxing you.
[01:11:57.508 --> 01:12:03.569]  Any qualified virologist or genomic scientist would be able to confirm this.
[01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.210]  But those scientists are being censored.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.542]  But let's get to the other issue that I mentioned.
[01:12:08.542 --> 01:12:18.630]  The fact that this is now out in the wild means that any radical Islamic nation in the world, let's say such as Iran, can go out and harvest samples of this.
[01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:24.794]  They can send 50 people to China to deliberately get infected and then return back to Iran.
[01:12:24.794 --> 01:12:28.477]  They can take saliva samples or blood samples from those individuals.
[01:12:29.133 --> 01:12:32.675]  They can then replicate the virus and put samples in the freezer.
[01:12:32.675 --> 01:12:33.815]  They can study that virus.
[01:12:33.815 --> 01:12:34.956]  They can tweak it.
[01:12:34.956 --> 01:12:39.118]  This just saved Iran 20 years of research on biological weapons.
[01:12:39.118 --> 01:12:40.919]  Same thing is true with North Korea.
[01:12:40.919 --> 01:12:43.740]  I haven't seen anybody in the media talking about this yet.
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:51.564]  We're talking about leapfrogging the biological weapons research of countries that are enemies of the United States of America.
[01:12:51.564 --> 01:12:54.225]  And here we are in America with a wide open border.
[01:12:54.858 --> 01:12:58.441]  An open border that anybody can just walk across.
[01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:01.843]  They could be a human weapon that's deliberately infected with this.
[01:13:01.843 --> 01:13:03.704]  They could be someone that's going to release it.
[01:13:03.704 --> 01:13:04.505]  They could have samples.
[01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:06.786]  They could have it in a spray bottle.
[01:13:06.786 --> 01:13:08.648]  They could have it in their own saliva.
[01:13:08.648 --> 01:13:15.713]  They could run around an airport or a subway or a mall or a movie theater and they could spread this everywhere across America right now.
[01:13:15.713 --> 01:13:17.334]  It's called asymmetric warfare, folks.
[01:13:18.197 --> 01:13:23.382]  It means that a very low-budget, low-tech country can now cause mass chaos.
[01:13:23.382 --> 01:13:24.663]  They can cause mass death.
[01:13:24.663 --> 01:13:28.687]  They can spread a pandemic and they don't even need, really, a lab.
[01:13:28.687 --> 01:13:33.311]  All they need to do now is just replicate the virus, which your body does naturally.
[01:13:33.311 --> 01:13:35.213]  They could use humans to do it.
[01:13:35.854 --> 01:13:40.015]  They could just collect saliva from a bunch of humans, and that would actually accomplish this.
[01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:51.918]  And then they could aerosolize that, or just use simple PCR technology to replicate the gene sequences, you know, or just use some tissue that the virus would infect, such as egg yolks, for example, or whatever.
[01:13:51.918 --> 01:13:58.640]  They could build masses of bioweapons now based on this, and then deliberately release them in the United States.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.401]  And it's unbelievably easy for them to do that.
[01:14:01.401 --> 01:14:04.882]  The reason I mention this is because we have not seen the last of this.
[01:14:05.663 --> 01:14:18.252]  Even if we beat this first wave of the pandemic coming out of China, and that is a definite possibility, the CDC put the quarantine on those people that came back, 195 Americans, two-week quarantine.
[01:14:18.252 --> 01:14:19.493]  That was a necessary step.
[01:14:19.493 --> 01:14:22.816]  I agree with the CDC's decision to do that.
[01:14:22.816 --> 01:14:30.221]  The CDC has been working feverishly to try to stop this infection, even as they're not telling the public the truth of how bad it is.
[01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:34.084]  We now have another case just confirmed in Santa Clara County, as mentioned previously.
[01:14:34.795 --> 01:14:44.461]  But we might be able to stop this first wave in the United States because of the travel ban on foreign nationals coming from China, which was put in place, I think, yesterday or the day before.
[01:14:44.461 --> 01:14:46.202]  We might be able to stop the first wave.
[01:14:46.202 --> 01:14:49.684]  But what about the terrorism wave that's coming next?
[01:14:49.684 --> 01:15:03.972]  Because enemies of America can take this, they can weaponize it, they can just replicate it, and they can reintroduce it into the United States in cities like Miami or New York, or they can literally walk across the border with it and just start infecting people.
[01:15:04.702 --> 01:15:08.605]  In El Paso, Texas or in Los Angeles or anywhere.
[01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:13.529]  That's how easy it is now for them to weaponize this and use it as a weapon.
[01:15:13.529 --> 01:15:16.271]  Deploy it as a weapon against the United States of America.
[01:15:16.271 --> 01:15:18.153]  It's an open source bioweapon.
[01:15:18.153 --> 01:15:18.954]  It's already out there.
[01:15:18.954 --> 01:15:21.255]  The code is out there.
[01:15:21.255 --> 01:15:23.898]  No one needs to do any additional research.
[01:15:23.898 --> 01:15:26.980]  All they need to do is harvest it and replicate it and then deploy it.
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.383]  So this is the cost of playing God with viruses.
[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:39.028]  This is the cost of running these mad medical experiments with gene sequences, with genetic engineering.
[01:15:39.028 --> 01:15:48.397]  And in fact, I warned about this very thing in the year 2012, here on InfoWars.com, called Stop Out of Control Science.
[01:15:48.397 --> 01:15:51.140]  Eight years ago, I warned about this exact scenario, and it's here.
[01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:58.712]  We've got three big sales going right now.
[01:15:58.712 --> 01:16:01.094]  And one of them has to end within a week.
[01:16:01.094 --> 01:16:03.056]  And that's Ultimate Fish Oil 4.
[01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:06.711]  33% off.
[01:16:06.711 --> 01:16:07.532]  It's amazing.
[01:16:07.532 --> 01:16:09.093]  Go check it out for yourself.
[01:16:09.093 --> 01:16:17.539]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling Deep Earth Crystals Iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:19.740]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:24.623]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:27.005]  So just check it out for yourself.
[01:16:27.005 --> 01:16:27.445]  40% off.

[01:16:28.826 --> 01:16:29.747]  And it funds the M4.
[01:16:29.747 --> 01:16:30.948]  And then Vitamin
[01:16:31.508 --> 01:16:34.389]  D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together.
[01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:35.630]  Super high quality.
[01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:36.690]  Winter sun.
[01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:38.511]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:41.133]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[01:16:41.133 --> 01:16:42.413]  That's why people get so sick.
[01:16:42.413 --> 01:16:43.213]  That's the main reason.
[01:16:43.213 --> 01:16:45.454]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue.
[01:16:45.454 --> 01:16:46.315]  Get higher absorption.
[01:16:46.315 --> 01:16:47.195]  It's amazing.
[01:16:47.195 --> 01:16:51.958]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at InfowarStore.com.
[01:16:51.958 --> 01:16:53.698]  Protect yourself and fund the Infowar.
[01:16:53.698 --> 01:16:53.918]  360WIN.
[01:16:55.609 --> 01:17:03.337]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China and the food supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[01:17:03.337 --> 01:17:12.767]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States west coast.
[01:17:12.767 --> 01:17:17.812]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already run out
[01:17:18.132 --> 01:17:19.413]  That's right.
[01:17:19.413 --> 01:17:27.716]  The rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[01:17:27.716 --> 01:17:33.479]  Infowars, private labels from MyPatriotSupply, and ships right out of the very same factory.
[01:17:33.479 --> 01:17:40.762]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a few weeks, and that people need to order now.
[01:17:40.762 --> 01:17:43.584]  They want to be able to get it within seven to ten days.
[01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:46.525]  If people wait, it may end up being longer.
[01:17:46.525 --> 01:17:53.709]  But if you get your order in now at InfoWarsTore.com, you will be secured to get the food within 7 to 10 days.
[01:17:56.348 --> 01:18:08.061]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[01:18:08.061 --> 01:18:16.871]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[01:18:17.532 --> 01:18:22.098]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:28.026]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[01:18:28.026 --> 01:18:33.113]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[01:18:33.593 --> 01:18:43.518]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:46.260]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:48.841]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[01:18:48.841 --> 01:18:51.943]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[01:18:51.943 --> 01:18:55.365]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[01:18:55.956 --> 01:19:01.782]  I want to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[01:19:01.782 --> 01:19:05.346]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[01:19:05.346 --> 01:19:07.649]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[01:19:07.649 --> 01:19:09.471]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:17.059]  So here I am telling people Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[01:19:17.059 --> 01:19:17.519]  And I'm 45 years old.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.261]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[01:19:20.261 --> 01:19:21.961]  And it's fluoride-free.
[01:19:21.961 --> 01:19:25.202]  I think the big difference, the game-changer in this, is the coral calcium.
[01:19:25.202 --> 01:19:28.823]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[01:19:28.823 --> 01:19:33.484]  And the toothpaste, I don't even, like, rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[01:19:33.484 --> 01:19:35.725]  It feels so good.
[01:19:35.725 --> 01:19:38.926]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[01:19:38.926 --> 01:19:45.127]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[01:19:45.127 --> 01:19:46.788]  Because I like the way it feels.
[01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:09.516]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.516 --> 01:20:11.938]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:11.938 --> 01:20:15.840]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[01:20:20.276 --> 01:20:23.137]  How will we know whether the quarantines are working?
[01:20:23.137 --> 01:20:24.997]  How will we know that this is being solved?
[01:20:24.997 --> 01:20:26.298]  I'm going to give you some guidelines here.
[01:20:26.298 --> 01:20:27.758]  Welcome back to the show.
[01:20:27.758 --> 01:20:29.778]  InfoWars.com, The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:29.778 --> 01:20:35.100]  Mike Adams from NaturalNews.com stepping in here for the last hour today, Sunday, February 2nd.
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:42.342]  I'm going to be joined by Tom Papert from National File 2 in the next segment coming up, so make sure you don't go anywhere for that.
[01:20:42.342 --> 01:20:45.582]  But February 8th is going to be a key date here.
[01:20:45.582 --> 01:20:47.883]  February 8th is the pivotal date
[01:20:48.803 --> 01:21:00.449]  If the quarantines in China are working, then it means that the spread of the virus has been halted since the day the quarantine was slammed down on 56 million Chinese.
[01:21:00.449 --> 01:21:03.911]  And that was roughly just a little bit over a week ago.
[01:21:03.911 --> 01:21:07.053]  So if you fast forward two weeks from that quarantine date,
[01:21:07.631 --> 01:21:09.811]  Which is roughly around February 8th.
[01:21:09.811 --> 01:21:19.294]  It means that if the quarantine is working and the virus has stopped spreading, then whatever the number of infections are on February 8th should remain the same.
[01:21:19.294 --> 01:21:21.514]  It should plateau on that day.
[01:21:21.514 --> 01:21:24.015]  So, I want you to watch very carefully.
[01:21:24.015 --> 01:21:25.115]  That's six days away.
[01:21:25.115 --> 01:21:27.155]  It's next Saturday.
[01:21:27.155 --> 01:21:30.156]  If the infections have stopped growing,
[01:21:30.845 --> 01:21:36.907]  Then we, as a world community, I guess, we have beaten the virus, okay?
[01:21:36.907 --> 01:21:39.428]  At least we've beaten it in China.
[01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:40.528]  So watch for that.
[01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:46.471]  However, if the numbers continue to grow after February 8th, then it means it is uncontained.
[01:21:46.471 --> 01:21:54.753]  It means we have a self-sustaining outbreak, or series of outbreaks, a pandemic, in other words, that's global in its scale.
[01:21:54.753 --> 01:21:58.895]  And that seems to be the more likely case at the moment, but we'll have to wait and see.
[01:21:59.798 --> 01:22:08.601]  Now, what's really critical to understand about the dates and the lag time here is that the Wuhan region, of course, has had a massive outbreak.
[01:22:08.601 --> 01:22:13.542]  Probably, you know, according to estimates by other scientists, at least 75,000 people infected.
[01:22:13.542 --> 01:22:17.523]  We know that hospitals are burying and cremating masses of bodies.
[01:22:17.523 --> 01:22:20.184]  The number of dead is not merely 300-something.
[01:22:20.184 --> 01:22:24.205]  It's probably in the many thousands, but we just don't have official confirmation.
[01:22:24.585 --> 01:22:25.106]  Yet.
[01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:31.551]  I guess Facebook will ban that as a rumor, because Facebook is now protecting Communist China and its lies.
[01:22:31.551 --> 01:22:35.854]  But the number of deaths is certainly greater than 300.
[01:22:35.854 --> 01:22:49.205]  Nevertheless, because of the isolation quarantine, the draconian measures that have taken place in the Wuhan region, we should see that region start to slow in terms of the number of new infections and number of deaths.
[01:22:49.205 --> 01:22:54.129]  However, another analysis that was published in the Lancet Journal, which we covered yesterday,
[01:22:54.657 --> 01:23:07.181]  Natural News, also by researchers in Hong Kong, they analyzed the flight patterns of flights that left Wuhan, air flights to other cities around China and around Asia.
[01:23:07.181 --> 01:23:14.764]  There were, I believe, about 300 different destinations that received passengers from all of those flights.
[01:23:14.764 --> 01:23:23.867]  Those flights delivered infected, symptomless carriers to all of those other cities and all those other regions.
[01:23:25.183 --> 01:23:35.854]  And there will be a lag time as those regions start to show the exploding outbreak, the self-replicating outbreaks that might be under control in the Wuhan region.
[01:23:35.854 --> 01:23:38.016]  So that's what to look for first.
[01:23:38.016 --> 01:23:45.824]  It's going to be really, if you consider Wuhan to be the first wave of the pandemic, the second wave is going to be other cities around China and other countries in the Asian region.
[01:23:46.344 --> 01:23:49.606]  Right now, Thailand and Japan have the most infections.
[01:23:49.606 --> 01:23:54.969]  Yeah, if you're watching, that map that you're seeing on screen shows you all the flight patterns out of Wuhan.
[01:23:54.969 --> 01:24:00.512]  Wuhan is the center, the red dot in the center of that map, shows you all the different places the flights went to.
[01:24:00.512 --> 01:24:10.918]  These flights were taking place when human-to-human transmission was already known to have occurred, which means that this virus has already been transplanted all across China and all across Asia.
[01:24:11.556 --> 01:24:18.760]  The fact that we're now getting a death in the Philippines and we're getting more cases in Thailand, for example.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.561]  We're seeing more cases in Hong Kong.
[01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:23.163]  It's looking like it's going to really go pandemic.
[01:24:23.163 --> 01:24:26.945]  You know, it's going to have an outbreak in Hong Kong is what looks likely.
[01:24:26.945 --> 01:24:27.285]  Japan.
[01:24:28.087 --> 01:24:32.050]  Over 20 cases now, according to the last numbers, or at least 20.
[01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:34.232]  And Japan may be able to control it.
[01:24:34.232 --> 01:24:35.813]  Japan has good technology.
[01:24:35.813 --> 01:24:39.016]  Japan has a very obedient type of society.
[01:24:39.016 --> 01:24:42.879]  If any country can get it under control there, it's probably Japan and Taiwan.
[01:24:42.879 --> 01:24:45.321]  Taiwan learned a lot of lessons from SARS.
[01:24:45.321 --> 01:24:49.745]  And I'm being told from our own personnel who are in Taiwan, you know we have an office in Taiwan,
[01:24:50.505 --> 01:24:52.706]  We are a Chinese-speaking publisher.
[01:24:52.706 --> 01:24:57.389]  We're being told that Taiwan is taking amazing steps, highly organized.
[01:24:57.389 --> 01:24:59.530]  They have a massive crackdown plan.
[01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:03.352]  They've been able to isolate travelers, ban travelers from China.
[01:25:03.352 --> 01:25:07.414]  They've been able to get people into health care very quickly.
[01:25:08.078 --> 01:25:17.705]  And they're trying all kinds of different medications, including, by the way, HIV drugs and SARS type of drugs, which are apparently having some success in the hospitals there.
[01:25:17.705 --> 01:25:21.928]  That's a completely different story that I probably won't have time to cover today.
[01:25:21.928 --> 01:25:27.352]  But other countries, such as Thailand or India, I have very little faith.
[01:25:27.352 --> 01:25:28.272]  This is my own opinion.
[01:25:28.272 --> 01:25:35.057]  I have very little faith in a country like Thailand or India being able to control this if it becomes out of control in those regions.
[01:25:35.057 --> 01:25:37.499]  What it means is that if any one of these countries fails,
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:48.067]  If it breaks out of containment, then this becomes a global pandemic because you can't isolate one country very easily in our global marketplace, in our global transportation system.
[01:25:48.067 --> 01:25:52.630]  And now we have cases that are being reported in certain Central and South American countries.
[01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:56.813]  Not confirmed yet, but there was one death that occurred in the United States.
[01:25:56.813 --> 01:25:58.734]  The dead body was shipped back to Peru.
[01:25:58.734 --> 01:26:00.516]  I read that this morning.
[01:26:00.516 --> 01:26:06.620]  If this gets out of control in Peru or South America or any Central American nation, it's eventually going to get to Mexico.
[01:26:07.276 --> 01:26:15.460]  And if it gets to Mexico and starts to spread in Mexico, because again, the Mexican government can't even control the drug cartels there, you think they're going to be able to control a pandemic?
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:16.560]  I don't think so.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:20.883]  If it spreads in Mexico, you're going to have a panic rush to the border of the United States.
[01:26:20.883 --> 01:26:25.085]  People fleeing the pandemic, but then carrying it into the United States.
[01:26:25.085 --> 01:26:27.886]  And they're going to go right to the sanctuary cities.
[01:26:27.886 --> 01:26:36.250]  So you're going to have infected, asymptomatic carriers in this scenario, which we hope doesn't happen, but they're going to head right for the sanctuary cities.
[01:26:36.869 --> 01:26:49.385]  And you're going to have him going to San Francisco, where people are literally crapping in the streets, human feces everywhere, and we just have confirmation last night that the virus replicates and is found in human feces.
[01:26:50.290 --> 01:27:02.499]  So what happens when you have people in San Francisco who are infected because of the illegal immigrants who themselves are infected and they're fleeing the pandemic, let's say in Mexico, if that situation occurs.
[01:27:02.499 --> 01:27:15.488]  They're going to be in San Francisco, which already has massive problems of needle sharing, homelessness, filth and feces in the streets everywhere, which gets washed into the ocean, gets swept back up onto the beaches of the West Coast.
[01:27:15.488 --> 01:27:19.391]  Now you've got coronavirus across the beaches of California, Oregon and Washington.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.581]  And now you have no containment.
[01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:29.804]  As I've said in my own articles, a nation that cannot control its borders cannot control a pandemic.
[01:27:29.804 --> 01:27:37.987]  This pandemic, if it spreads to Mexico, may be a wake-up call for America's border security.
[01:27:37.987 --> 01:27:41.808]  Because if we can't control our border, we are going to be overrun.
[01:27:41.808 --> 01:27:46.930]  And depending on whether this is a bioweapon or a vaccine experiment gone wrong, the fatalities,
[01:27:47.605 --> 01:27:55.308]  You know, according to current estimates, it could be anywhere from 1% to 15%, just depending on how the mutations occur, what happens between now and then.
[01:27:55.308 --> 01:28:07.552]  And even the survivors suffer severe respiratory damage, scarring of lung tissue, acute cardiovascular damage, heart injuries that will stay with you for the rest of your life.
[01:28:07.552 --> 01:28:08.633]  Even if you survive this,
[01:28:09.497 --> 01:28:13.598]  You're going to be damaged and literally scarred for life in most cases.
[01:28:13.598 --> 01:28:15.859]  And secondary infections are a concern as well.
[01:28:15.859 --> 01:28:23.841]  That doesn't even count the logistics collapse, the chaos, the fear, you know, just the lack of supplies, the quarantines, the isolation.
[01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:29.763]  The CDC has already slapped down a federal quarantine order against those 195 Americans.
[01:28:29.763 --> 01:28:34.684]  They will not hesitate to do it against a city or town if an outbreak starts to occur there.
[01:28:34.684 --> 01:28:36.805]  And they, frankly, would not be wrong to do so.
[01:28:37.782 --> 01:28:38.544]  There's much more coming.
[01:28:38.544 --> 01:28:42.551]  We're going to be joined by Tom Papert from National File in the next segment, so stay with us.
[01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:45.497]  This is Mike Adams here on InfoWars.com.
[01:28:45.497 --> 01:28:48.162]  We'll be back after this break with more reporting and analysis.
[01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:58.391]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods.
[01:28:58.391 --> 01:29:01.211]  I would have storable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:02.972]  The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[01:29:02.972 --> 01:29:03.732]  I hope it doesn't.
[01:29:03.732 --> 01:29:08.473]  It's incredibly dangerous and it'll cause... Well, you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant bubble pops.
[01:29:08.473 --> 01:29:14.114]  So, I've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality, it's insurance you can eat, it lasts 25 years.
[01:29:14.114 --> 01:29:18.475]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very lowest price.
[01:29:18.475 --> 01:29:19.975]  And that's my Patriot Supply.
[01:29:19.975 --> 01:29:23.996]  And then, so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private label it
[01:29:24.096 --> 01:29:25.117]  We're good to go!
[01:29:52.032 --> 01:29:57.574]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:57.574 --> 01:30:03.237]  Folks, once you need the food, once you need the water filters, once you need the masks, it'll be too late to get them.
[01:30:03.237 --> 01:30:08.519]  You gotta get them now before you find that you require them for survival.
[01:30:08.519 --> 01:30:11.980]  Trust us, this is not something to be messing around with.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:19.163]  Please go to Infowarsstore.com, make your purchase today, and at least have that part of survival covered.
[01:30:19.683 --> 01:30:26.027]  The food, the time it will take for the rest of society to collapse or calm down or whatever the case may be.
[01:30:26.027 --> 01:30:29.029]  The RZ Air Filtration Mask M2 Mesh.
[01:30:29.029 --> 01:30:30.370]  I have one of those personally.
[01:30:30.370 --> 01:30:33.832]  I've got a couple of these things off the old InfoWars store.
[01:30:33.832 --> 01:30:34.753]  I am prepared.
[01:30:34.753 --> 01:30:35.093]  Are you?
[01:30:35.093 --> 01:30:38.135]  If you're not, InfoWarsStore.com on sale now.
[01:30:38.135 --> 01:30:40.837]  Everything you need to prepare yourself for whatever comes next, folks.
[01:30:40.837 --> 01:30:42.958]  It's not necessarily the disease.
[01:30:42.958 --> 01:30:45.240]  It's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.842]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for.
[01:30:49.042 --> 01:30:53.343]  Food will be off the shelves, water won't be available, you might not even be able to leave your house.
[01:30:53.343 --> 01:30:57.664]  You gotta be prepared before it comes down.
[01:30:57.664 --> 01:31:00.925]  This should really be easier than it is.
[01:31:00.925 --> 01:31:03.066]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[01:31:03.066 --> 01:31:05.547]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[01:31:05.547 --> 01:31:13.949]  Things that I've discovered, that I absolutely know work, that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:15.050]  I hope so.
[01:31:36.084 --> 01:31:41.090]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:48.779]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[01:31:48.779 --> 01:31:49.961]  It's amazing.

[01:32:02.942 --> 01:32:12.212]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of InfoWarsTore.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best,
[01:32:12.813 --> 01:32:14.594]  Well, it gives people the best results.
[01:32:14.594 --> 01:32:18.317]  We either private label it, or we develop our own with top developers.
[01:32:18.317 --> 01:32:23.180]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:26.082]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[01:32:26.082 --> 01:32:27.003]  It's incredible.
[01:32:27.003 --> 01:32:28.664]  So do yourself a favor.
[01:32:28.664 --> 01:32:31.146]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[01:32:31.146 --> 01:32:34.028]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action.

[01:32:42.854 --> 01:32:45.916]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[01:32:45.916 --> 01:32:49.838]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it, word of mouth.
[01:32:49.838 --> 01:32:53.681]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO, instead of imploding.
[01:32:53.681 --> 01:32:59.364]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning, thanks to you.
[01:32:59.364 --> 01:33:02.006]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.914 --> 01:33:23.917]  More bombshell news and analysis continuing here on the InfoWars.com show, Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.917 --> 01:33:25.158]  For this Sunday, Mike Adams here.
[01:33:25.158 --> 01:33:28.639]  We're going to be joined by Tom Papert from National File in just a minute.
[01:33:28.639 --> 01:33:34.962]  We're going to go to a second clip from that interview with Dr. James Lyons-Weiler with Adele Bigtree.
[01:33:34.962 --> 01:33:37.083]  More bombshell information in this clip.
[01:33:37.083 --> 01:33:38.844]  It just blew my mind when I heard this.
[01:33:38.844 --> 01:33:40.104]  It's only about a minute.
[01:33:40.104 --> 01:33:42.285]  Listen carefully to what he says.
[01:33:42.285 --> 01:33:45.727]  He's analyzing the genomic sequence of this coronavirus.
[01:33:45.727 --> 01:33:46.327]  Go ahead and roll that.
[01:33:47.324 --> 01:33:51.790]  Where are the odds now stacked up as a scientist looking at this?
[01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:57.999]  I can say I'm very, very certain it's not just a wild-type coronavirus that happened to acquire this element.
[01:33:57.999 --> 01:33:58.620]  Very certain.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.264]  We're ruling out wild, wild virus in the woods.
[01:34:02.185 --> 01:34:04.607]  Which means it's laboratory-acquired somehow.
[01:34:04.607 --> 01:34:15.457]  It's escaped from the laboratory or the people have been vaccinated with it and that's why it's in their bodies and that's why they test positive for this particular vaccine.
[01:34:15.457 --> 01:34:25.826]  There's a huge difference in the predicted health outcome for the world if this is a vaccination experiment in China versus just a laboratory-escaped vaccine.
[01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.348]  The vaccination experiment
[01:34:28.112 --> 01:34:29.954]  You're not vaccinated against coronavirus.
[01:34:29.954 --> 01:34:32.275]  People in Sweden are not vaccinated.
[01:34:32.275 --> 01:34:36.599]  People in Africa are not vaccinated against coronavirus with that vaccine.
[01:34:36.599 --> 01:34:55.494]  So if the Chinese tried to get a jump on the vaccine market by surreptitiously running clinical trials against the coronavirus and made their elderly and immunocompromised more susceptible to death due to subsequent infection by any coronavirus with the spike protein that's in the vaccine,
[01:34:56.095 --> 01:35:00.178]  Then the rest of the world has a serious humanitarian issue, but maybe it's not.
[01:35:00.178 --> 01:35:02.520]  Maybe it's a moderate level threat, right?
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:07.524]  And so the test of this hypothesis would be, do we see the same death rates in America?
[01:35:07.524 --> 01:35:09.465]  He's going to go into some more technical details.
[01:35:09.465 --> 01:35:13.008]  What he's saying, just to summarize, is that if this is a vaccine experiment that
[01:35:13.348 --> 01:35:13.628]  I think?
[01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:41.694]  It may be a global pandemic that that is sort of trending in that way as we're watching the numbers and we're watching the spread.
[01:35:41.694 --> 01:35:43.958]  We still don't know which one of these origins is the correct.
[01:35:44.834 --> 01:35:46.035]  Explanation.
[01:35:46.035 --> 01:35:47.216]  We know it's man-made.
[01:35:47.216 --> 01:35:53.780]  We know it's not a natural accident that lined up all these proteins and DNA sequences and RNA sequences.
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:54.701]  This is man-made.
[01:35:54.701 --> 01:35:56.622]  This came out of a lab.
[01:35:56.622 --> 01:36:02.306]  Now, we are joined by Tom Papert from National File, which has done outstanding reporting on this.
[01:36:02.306 --> 01:36:05.028]  Tom's been a contributor to InfoWars as well.
[01:36:05.028 --> 01:36:06.329]  I'm a fan of his work.
[01:36:06.329 --> 01:36:07.730]  Tom, what do you make of all this?
[01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:11.612]  You just watched that clip, plus all the research that you've been doing.
[01:36:11.612 --> 01:36:13.574]  What's your take on where we stand right now?
[01:36:14.957 --> 01:36:17.239]  Well, you know, Mike, I'm a big fan of yours as well.
[01:36:17.239 --> 01:36:19.121]  It's great to finally come on with you.
[01:36:19.121 --> 01:36:24.547]  Of course, I've talked to Dr. Steve Pachinik and others who, of course, have a slightly different opinion.
[01:36:24.547 --> 01:36:28.211]  I tend to think your analysis is more or less spot on.
[01:36:28.211 --> 01:36:29.813]  I mean, I'm not an expert like you are.
[01:36:29.813 --> 01:36:31.394]  I can't really challenge it.
[01:36:31.394 --> 01:36:32.135]  I do wonder.
[01:36:32.135 --> 01:36:34.538]  I mean, you watch videos like this.
[01:36:34.538 --> 01:36:37.721]  You break down the articles and the breaking news that you have.
[01:36:38.061 --> 01:36:47.886]  Today on the show, and then you see events like in Malaysia or in Thailand, where as you said, this could be a giant disaster in the making.
[01:36:47.886 --> 01:36:59.493]  We have a video up at nationalfile.com of people getting off a plane, ostensibly from China, and officials are just there spraying them down with who knows what to try and disinfect them.
[01:36:59.493 --> 01:37:05.496]  I mean, from my understanding, that's going to do absolutely nothing when it comes to stopping the spread of this virus.
[01:37:06.036 --> 01:37:07.757]  I think it is a giant threat.
[01:37:07.757 --> 01:37:14.279]  I think the fact that the Facebook fact-checking Nazis are all over this bodes very poorly for us.
[01:37:14.279 --> 01:37:28.424]  We had a caller on the War Room last week who pointed out that China is not going to risk losing billions of dollars by quarantining 60 million people unless the opposite side of that, the risk that they would take by not doing this quarantine,
[01:37:28.784 --> 01:37:29.785]  It's all kind of bizarre.
[01:37:49.714 --> 01:37:50.195]  Good.
[01:37:50.195 --> 01:37:55.538]  Well, the thing is, you know, the Communist government can only cover this up for so long.
[01:37:55.538 --> 01:37:59.121]  You know, how many bodies can they bury before people start to notice?
[01:37:59.121 --> 01:38:03.164]  How many infections can they downplay before people start to notice?
[01:38:03.164 --> 01:38:11.930]  We already know that they're creating artificial scarcity in the diagnostic tests in order to avoid diagnosing people with this infection, but as this spreads,
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:18.728]  It's going to become harder and harder to cover up, even for the so-called fact-checkers, even for the tech media, the tech giants.
[01:38:18.728 --> 01:38:25.216]  Their censorship can't stop the spread of truth, which hopefully the truth will spread faster than the pandemic.
[01:38:25.216 --> 01:38:26.258]  Otherwise, we're all in trouble.
[01:38:26.258 --> 01:38:26.959]  What are your thoughts?
[01:38:28.297 --> 01:38:29.618]  Well, I certainly think you're right.
[01:38:29.618 --> 01:38:33.282]  I mean, they've tried to stomp the truth in many different forms, many different facets.
[01:38:33.282 --> 01:38:34.684]  That's why BAM.video exists.
[01:38:34.684 --> 01:38:35.965]  That's why Brighteon exists.
[01:38:35.965 --> 01:38:37.807]  That's why your website is thriving.
[01:38:37.807 --> 01:38:38.888]  InfoWars is thriving.
[01:38:38.888 --> 01:38:40.129]  National File is thriving.
[01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:43.893]  Because people in America are not docile like the Chinese.
[01:38:43.893 --> 01:38:45.935]  I mean, it's very sad what's happened to them.
[01:38:46.235 --> 01:38:49.598]  Likely as a result of living under communism for generations.
[01:38:49.598 --> 01:39:01.046]  There's a new report out in a British magazine, British newspaper, that says people in Wuhan are being ordered to kill their dogs and cats, to murder their pets, because they might carry it.
[01:39:01.046 --> 01:39:03.468]  And they're just brought, you know, they've been bred.
[01:39:03.468 --> 01:39:07.110]  Everybody who had a rebellious gene was killed under Chairman Mao.
[01:39:07.110 --> 01:39:10.793]  So I'm sure that they're going to willingly go along with whatever the government wants.
[01:39:11.437 --> 01:39:18.009]  Do you see, I mean, some folks have said that China is the best place this could happen because of their totalitarian nature.
[01:39:18.009 --> 01:39:19.191]  Do you agree with that analysis?
[01:39:20.325 --> 01:39:30.990]  Well, I do agree with the sense that China is willing to stampede human rights and civil rights in order to eliminate the spread of this virus.
[01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:33.551]  They are killing people in the process.
[01:39:33.551 --> 01:39:36.972]  People have no access to health care options.
[01:39:36.972 --> 01:39:38.133]  They're running out of food.
[01:39:38.133 --> 01:39:41.194]  They're running out of medical supplies and fuel as well.
[01:39:41.194 --> 01:39:44.495]  Starvation and secondary diseases are going to kick in.
[01:39:44.495 --> 01:39:47.877]  But China has the kind of structure and hierarchy
[01:39:48.457 --> 01:39:52.599]  To achieve that goal, even though that goal is anti-human.
[01:39:52.599 --> 01:39:53.720]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.221]  Whereas other countries don't even have that infrastructure.
[01:39:56.221 --> 01:40:01.744]  So if this gets out of control in Thailand, or India, or Mexico, or places like that, forget it.
[01:40:01.744 --> 01:40:03.945]  Government can't control those countries at all.
[01:40:03.945 --> 01:40:11.948]  In fact, you know, Thailand's on the verge of a revolution almost every day, and India can't make, you know, traffic lights work without causing chaos.
[01:40:11.948 --> 01:40:15.150]  So, you know, who knows where this is going if infections spread there?
[01:40:16.556 --> 01:40:18.317]  Well, you bring up such a good point about India.
[01:40:18.317 --> 01:40:22.299]  I mean, we have this study which now has just been totally retracted.
[01:40:22.299 --> 01:40:33.145]  And me, as somebody who, I'm not a scientist, I'm not an expert, that's why I'm so glad to be on with you, I look at this and I'm thinking, why on earth would you retract a study that you just put out days ago?
[01:40:33.145 --> 01:40:42.490]  Now, like, half the medical community around the world is struggling to say, uh, never mind, we reported on this, it seemed logical at the time, seemed to make sense, but it's been retracted.
[01:40:42.490 --> 01:40:43.090]  So, what
[01:40:43.630 --> 01:40:50.493]  In your opinion, is the reason why this study is gone, is it just as you said, this is a group of people who didn't do all their homework?
[01:40:50.493 --> 01:40:52.514]  Or is there something more nefarious?
[01:40:52.514 --> 01:40:55.135]  Well, it was retracted simply because it started getting attention.
[01:40:55.135 --> 01:40:55.495]  That's it.
[01:40:55.495 --> 01:40:59.837]  You know, I've interviewed scientists who have been imprisoned because their research
[01:41:00.726 --> 01:41:03.948]  Contradicted the official stories, and they were threatened.
[01:41:03.948 --> 01:41:10.732]  They were told, you either retract your research, you apologize to the scientific community, or we're going to prosecute you and send you to jail.
[01:41:10.732 --> 01:41:11.592]  And they did.
[01:41:11.592 --> 01:41:13.414]  I've interviewed many scientists.
[01:41:13.414 --> 01:41:23.439]  One from my film, BioSludge, that was threatened with being physically harmed and pulled out of his house at night by armed people working like a SWAT team for the EPA.
[01:41:24.901 --> 01:41:29.824]  That said, don't you dare talk about viruses and bio-sludge and how that's not safe.
[01:41:29.824 --> 01:41:34.726]  By the way, I've got some breaking news here, a translation from our team in Taiwan.
[01:41:34.726 --> 01:41:41.329]  There was an individual who tested positive for the coronavirus in Vietnam.
[01:41:41.329 --> 01:41:49.934]  He took a flight from the United States to Vietnam and there was a two-hour stop in Wuhan, that airport, on January 15th.
[01:41:51.508 --> 01:41:52.809]  January 15th.
[01:41:52.809 --> 01:41:54.089]  He was there for just two hours.
[01:41:54.089 --> 01:41:55.270]  He caught the virus.
[01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:57.951]  He showed no symptoms for 11 days.
[01:41:57.951 --> 01:42:02.332]  He checked into the hospital just three days ago in Vietnam.
[01:42:02.332 --> 01:42:11.536]  This means that the Wuhan airport was spreading this virus from at least January 15th to the day that that airport was locked down, the quarantine day.
[01:42:11.536 --> 01:42:18.059]  That's probably around 10 days that people were flying all over the world with this virus with no quarantine in place.
[01:42:18.059 --> 01:42:20.020]  That's breaking news.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:21.120]  Just stunning.
[01:42:23.146 --> 01:42:27.071]  And if there's one, I mean, this, from my knowledge, is probably the first person in Vietnam.
[01:42:27.071 --> 01:42:30.475]  If there's one, this is a major, this is one folks don't understand, I think, Mike.
[01:42:30.475 --> 01:42:35.642]  We're talking a area that's five or six different L.A.s crammed into one small area.
[01:42:35.642 --> 01:42:38.065]  This probably went all around the globe in that period of time.
[01:42:39.465 --> 01:42:44.131]  Yeah, exactly, and people could still be carrying it right now, incubating it in their bodies right now.
[01:42:44.131 --> 01:42:47.135]  We may not see a wave for another week or so, but we'll be back.
[01:42:47.135 --> 01:42:51.320]  You're watching InfoWars, Alex Jones Show, Mike Adams and Tom Paffert.
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.241]  We'll be back after this break.
[01:42:55.379 --> 01:42:56.160]  Well, it's here.
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.101]  The year 2020.
[01:42:57.101 --> 01:42:59.082]  World governments out in the open.
[01:42:59.082 --> 01:43:03.506]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[01:43:03.506 --> 01:43:17.377]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[01:43:17.377 --> 01:43:17.578]  Wow.
[01:43:18.138 --> 01:43:19.639]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[01:43:19.639 --> 01:43:20.939]  The New World Order's real.
[01:43:20.939 --> 01:43:21.999]  Satanism's real.
[01:43:21.999 --> 01:43:23.360]  The pedophile elite are real.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:27.201]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:31.923]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[01:43:31.923 --> 01:43:35.484]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[01:43:35.484 --> 01:43:39.806]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[01:43:40.086 --> 01:43:42.469]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[01:43:42.469 --> 01:43:43.851]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[01:43:43.851 --> 01:43:46.815]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[01:43:46.815 --> 01:43:53.824]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support at memphilwarshaw.com is critical.

[01:46:58.944 --> 01:47:01.626]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.251 --> 01:47:27.353]  All right, a quote here from Dr. James Lyons-Weiler in that interview that we played segments from earlier.
[01:47:27.353 --> 01:47:33.096]  Quote, in the worst case scenario, if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal,
[01:47:33.777 --> 01:47:44.993]  Then the 2019 NCOV, the coronavirus, novel coronavirus, could become, quote, the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history.
[01:47:44.993 --> 01:47:49.679]  That's one of the emerging theories right now, that this could be a vaccine experiment gone wrong.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:48:03.965]  If you know anything about the history of medical experimentation, even in the United States, President Obama was forced to apologize for NIH-funded medical experiments on prisoners in Guatemala that took place in US history.
[01:48:03.965 --> 01:48:04.245]  In fact,
[01:48:05.157 --> 01:48:12.062]  Medical experiments against American citizens have taken place over and over again and again for over a hundred years.
[01:48:12.062 --> 01:48:20.027]  Not just Tuskegee, but many other experiments involving typically African Americans, prisoners, and soldiers in the military.
[01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:27.594]  And yet now we have the tech giants conspiring with Communist China to cover all this up and protect China.
[01:48:27.594 --> 01:48:30.116]  And that's my first question to you in this final segment, Tom.
[01:48:30.116 --> 01:48:47.449]  Why do we now have a high-tech industry that is going to protect Communist China and cover up the truth that they let this out of the bag and they have placed all of humanity in a perilous situation, they are lying about it, and Google and Facebook and Twitter are going to protect China.
[01:48:47.449 --> 01:48:48.250]  Why is that happening?
[01:48:49.301 --> 01:48:53.584]  Well, it is baffling on the surface, but obviously these people have already sold out to China.
[01:48:53.584 --> 01:48:58.147]  They think that China is going to be the eminent country in the 21st century.
[01:48:58.147 --> 01:49:00.328]  They have, many of them have moved to China.
[01:49:00.328 --> 01:49:01.569]  They have businesses in China.
[01:49:01.569 --> 01:49:09.734]  They've partnered with China, because as you know, and the viewers know, you cannot have a business in China without the Chinese government and the Communist Party essentially
[01:49:10.194 --> 01:49:10.674]  Running it.
[01:49:10.674 --> 01:49:17.199]  And so then our mockingbird media at the AP Associated Press comes out with headlines like this.
[01:49:17.199 --> 01:49:21.521]  Fears of a new virus trigger anti-China sentiment worldwide.
[01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:23.983]  A scary new virus from China has spread around the world.
[01:49:23.983 --> 01:49:26.865]  So has rising anti-Chinese sentiment.
[01:49:27.225 --> 01:49:28.806]  I mean, that's terrible.
[01:49:28.806 --> 01:49:30.828]  I certainly hope that isn't happening.
[01:49:30.828 --> 01:49:37.232]  But nobody seems to be focused on the idea here that this thing has a rather high mortality rate.
[01:49:37.232 --> 01:49:40.294]  It can spread even when you are not symptomatic.
[01:49:40.294 --> 01:49:43.816]  It's been in virtually every single Western country right now.
[01:49:43.816 --> 01:49:46.058]  It's only a matter of time to see if the quarantines.
[01:49:46.058 --> 01:49:48.179]  Some of these people are just told to self-quarantine.
[01:49:48.179 --> 01:49:49.860]  Go home and don't leave for 14 days.
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:51.842]  Hope you have enough groceries.
[01:49:51.842 --> 01:49:52.822]  It's bizarre.
[01:49:52.822 --> 01:49:56.785]  And of course, the tech giants, they honestly, my take is,
[01:49:57.284 --> 01:49:59.406]  They think that China's going to weather this.
[01:49:59.406 --> 01:50:06.411]  As you've pointed out, Mike, if this breaks out in Central America or Africa or India, it's almost certainly not going to be able to weather this.
[01:50:06.411 --> 01:50:17.600]  If this breaks out in the United States in a place like, oh, I don't know, San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi's stomping grounds, where there is feces on the ground, there are people who you can't tell if they're alive or dead.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:19.501]  They're homeless and they're strung out on drugs.
[01:50:19.501 --> 01:50:20.943]  It's heartbreaking to see.
[01:50:20.943 --> 01:50:26.327]  But this could go absolutely insane, and the United States does not have our
[01:50:26.927 --> 01:50:31.649]  Citizenry does not have the makeup to allow, you know, the FEMA camps.
[01:50:31.649 --> 01:50:33.910]  We're not going to all go into those FEMA camps willingly.
[01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:36.011]  Alex has been talking about it for 25 years.
[01:50:36.011 --> 01:50:40.332]  We're not going to comply if they say your city is now in a quarantine, you're not allowed to leave your house.
[01:50:40.332 --> 01:50:42.853]  Oh, and by the way, you got to kill your cat and dog.
[01:50:42.853 --> 01:50:44.194]  We're not going to comply.
[01:50:44.194 --> 01:50:53.037]  Whereas China, these tech giants look at China, they see billions of people, they see an emerging market, they see a country that can weather this storm and where they can retreat to and make
[01:50:53.117 --> 01:50:53.658]  We're good.
[01:51:07.859 --> 01:51:13.021]  Hillary Clinton said they are fun camps, so you're going to have fun with the coronavirus.
[01:51:13.021 --> 01:51:21.104]  You're going to get to play dodgeball with the coronavirus in your fun camp enforced by the CDC if this gets out of control in the United States.
[01:51:21.104 --> 01:51:24.025]  But I can see where this is going based on what you just said, Tom.
[01:51:24.025 --> 01:51:29.787]  Soon it's going to be said that if you even believe that there is a pandemic, then you're racist, right?
[01:51:29.787 --> 01:51:35.309]  So they're going to say that biological weapons are a conspiracy theory, that there's never been a biological weapon.
[01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:46.276]  There are no bioweapons in the world and anyone who says that there has ever been a research lab anywhere ever in the history of the world, well, they are obviously a conspiracy theorist spewing fake news.
[01:51:46.276 --> 01:51:48.418]  There are no bioweapons whatsoever.
[01:51:48.418 --> 01:51:49.839]  All vaccines work.
[01:51:49.839 --> 01:51:51.340]  CNN tells the truth.
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:52.541]  The Russians stole the election.
[01:51:53.101 --> 01:51:58.725]  And Hillary Clinton is a beautiful goddess who wants to help you become a better human being.
[01:51:58.725 --> 01:51:59.306]  So there you go.
[01:51:59.306 --> 01:52:01.868]  A whole list of lies that are going to be coming our way.
[01:52:01.868 --> 01:52:04.990]  But look, I thought Trump derangement syndrome was bad.
[01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:07.632]  Looks like we're going to have pandemic denialism.
[01:52:08.485 --> 01:52:16.211]  As the next disease affecting leftists all across America and around the world, or as I've called it, trans-viralism.
[01:52:16.211 --> 01:52:24.678]  If you don't believe in biological reality, you make a wish and you pretend that you're not infected with a virus and you can change your gender too at the same time.
[01:52:24.678 --> 01:52:32.744]  So you can say, shazam, magic wand, I'm a woman and I'm not infected with the coronavirus because biology doesn't matter.
[01:52:32.744 --> 01:52:33.845]  That's what's coming.
[01:52:33.845 --> 01:52:34.506]  That's America.
[01:52:35.684 --> 01:52:40.247]  And it is, I mean, it's hilarious, but at the same time, it is so disconcerting.
[01:52:40.247 --> 01:52:54.715]  I mean, you go through this AP News article, they say there's racism in South Korea, the United States, Hong Kong, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Japan, all of this racism, Mike, how can we ever recover from the greatest evil mankind has ever known, racism?
[01:52:54.715 --> 01:52:59.658]  Meanwhile, there is a virus out there, and please correct me if I'm wrong, I honestly hope I am, but it sounds like
[01:53:00.058 --> 01:53:04.640]  I mean, at this thing, worst case scenario, 10% of all humans could die.
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:06.361]  Now, that's not what's important.
[01:53:06.361 --> 01:53:07.921]  What's important is the racism.
[01:53:07.921 --> 01:53:14.044]  You cannot be racist as you die in a hospital somewhere, for your body to be cremated, if your dogs and cats were killed a week before.
[01:53:15.143 --> 01:53:19.146]  No, imagine if this were released by white scientists.
[01:53:19.146 --> 01:53:22.388]  The New York Times would say, see, look, white people are bad.
[01:53:22.388 --> 01:53:24.430]  White people are trying to kill everybody in the world.
[01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:30.655]  Look, all these white scientists, they released a white virus that turns your lungs white and it kills you.
[01:53:30.655 --> 01:53:33.437]  I mean, if this were released by white people, it would be
[01:53:34.119 --> 01:53:39.404]  You know, Nazism would be like Hitler combined with a virus.
[01:53:39.404 --> 01:53:43.828]  It would be, you know, swastika shaped viruses under the electron microscope.
[01:53:43.828 --> 01:53:45.109]  It would be the worst thing ever.
[01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:54.157]  But since this came out of China, you have to lovingly accept it and be tolerant because you don't want to be seen as racist because this is a Chinese virus.
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:57.441]  Well, guess what?
[01:53:57.441 --> 01:54:00.382]  I married a Chinese from Taiwan.
[01:54:00.382 --> 01:54:03.904]  I'm not racist, and Taiwan's doing a great job defending against this.
[01:54:03.904 --> 01:54:06.285]  It's not the Chinese genes.
[01:54:06.285 --> 01:54:06.986]  It's the government.
[01:54:06.986 --> 01:54:08.406]  It's communism that's behind this.
[01:54:08.406 --> 01:54:10.968]  It's the lies and the lack of transparency of communism.
[01:54:10.968 --> 01:54:11.808]  That's the problem here.
[01:54:13.419 --> 01:54:14.640]  You said it perfectly.
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:36.737]  I mean, the entire reason why this is so out of control, I mean, China, they have their shining cities where they build a massive city, nobody even lives in it, but it was a great public work project, that China has their industrialized parts of the country where, of course, you have to wear a mask even on a perfectly normal day where there's no viral outbreak just because the air quality is so bad, but a lot of China is still incredibly rural, incredibly poor.
[01:54:36.737 --> 01:54:41.200]  I mean, for a lot of folks, I think you pointed out, their primary source of water is not running water.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.142]  It's not from the city municipal water supply.
[01:54:43.522 --> 01:54:44.903]  It's from the Yangtze River.
[01:54:44.903 --> 01:54:50.328]  It's from, you know, running water where people, where runoff goes into, where human waste goes into.
[01:54:50.328 --> 01:54:52.350]  That's where they go get their cooking water.
[01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:54.832]  This is a very poor country and it's because of the government.
[01:54:54.832 --> 01:55:02.479]  It is because they have suffered under the yoke of communism for the longest amount of time in history now, since the Soviet Union has gone, all these other countries.
[01:55:02.859 --> 01:55:03.080]  We're good.
[01:55:16.889 --> 01:55:17.789]  I'm glad you asked that.
[01:55:17.789 --> 01:55:20.330]  Yeah, we've got to get to solutions here.
[01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:22.471]  Number one, stay informed.
[01:55:22.471 --> 01:55:27.753]  You know, read National File, InfoWars, NaturalNews.com, Zero Hedge, the other independent media sources.
[01:55:27.753 --> 01:55:29.574]  That's the only place you're going to get the truth.
[01:55:29.574 --> 01:55:31.275]  Stay informed so you know what's coming.
[01:55:31.275 --> 01:55:38.098]  Secondly, look, even if this kills, let's say, 10% of the world population, that means 9 out of 10 people survive it.
[01:55:38.098 --> 01:55:43.580]  And how hard is it to be among those 9 out of 10 if you support your immune function?
[01:55:44.375 --> 01:55:51.078]  You take good supplements, you eat healthy, you lay off the junk foods, you have basic fitness, do some walking.
[01:55:51.078 --> 01:55:52.919]  Come on, take care of your health.
[01:55:52.919 --> 01:55:54.000]  You can overcome this.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.801]  People are being cured right now.
[01:55:55.801 --> 01:55:57.382]  People are overcoming this on their own.
[01:55:57.382 --> 01:56:00.123]  Some people never show any symptoms whatsoever.
[01:56:00.123 --> 01:56:03.045]  So a lot of this comes down to what is your health?
[01:56:03.045 --> 01:56:09.308]  If you live a sedentary lifestyle, living on junk foods and taking toxic medications and eating pesticides and GMOs all day,
[01:56:09.935 --> 01:56:13.656]  You're probably not going to have as good a survival chance as someone who lives a healthier lifestyle.
[01:56:13.656 --> 01:56:16.516]  It's just basic nutrition and biochemistry.
[01:56:16.516 --> 01:56:17.316]  So, right there.
[01:56:17.316 --> 01:56:19.057]  And then secondly, you can protect yourself.
[01:56:19.057 --> 01:56:20.197]  You can isolate yourself.
[01:56:20.197 --> 01:56:22.077]  You can wash your hands.
[01:56:22.077 --> 01:56:23.458]  You can avoid crowded areas.
[01:56:23.458 --> 01:56:25.378]  You can move out of the city.
[01:56:25.378 --> 01:56:31.599]  You know, you can get away from the sanctuary cities where this is likely to spread far more aggressively if it gets into the United States.
[01:56:31.599 --> 01:56:32.979]  So, a lot of things that you can do.
[01:56:32.979 --> 01:56:36.460]  I'm sure that you're already doing those things as well, too, Tom, right?
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:36.800]  Am I right?
[01:56:37.995 --> 01:56:38.755]  Well, absolutely.
[01:56:38.755 --> 01:56:40.616]  I mean, it's just basic common sense.
[01:56:40.616 --> 01:56:49.038]  You keep yourself healthy, you eat a salad, you get vitamin C supplements, you get a good iodine, you get the fantastic products at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:56:49.038 --> 01:56:58.841]  And of course, you know, should, I don't think they could pull it off here in America, but should 45, 55, 65 million Americans be quarantined, you're going to want to be able to eat while that happens.
[01:56:58.841 --> 01:57:02.002]  And of course, you can get storable food at InfoWareStore.com as well.
[01:57:03.775 --> 01:57:05.019]  Well, absolutely.
[01:57:05.019 --> 01:57:11.516]  Get your supplies now, because if this breaks containment in Asia, then the demand for supplies is going to skyrocket even more.
[01:57:12.705 --> 01:57:13.946]  But thank you for watching.
[01:57:13.946 --> 01:57:14.947]  Spread the word on this.
[01:57:14.947 --> 01:57:22.392]  Continue to check InfoWars.com, NaturalNews.com, NationalFile.com, and other independent websites.
[01:57:22.392 --> 01:57:27.636]  We'll have more live news here on InfoWars.com starting at, well, tomorrow morning, 11 a.m.
[01:57:27.636 --> 01:57:29.938]  Central is when Alex launches his show.
[01:57:29.938 --> 01:57:33.241]  This has been Mike Adams and Tom Papert with the analysis today.
[01:57:33.241 --> 01:57:34.602]  Stay safe, everybody.
[01:57:34.602 --> 01:57:38.024]  God bless America, and may we make it through this pandemic.
[01:57:38.024 --> 01:57:38.705]  Thank you for watching.
