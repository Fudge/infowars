[00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:11.751]  First, congratulations.
[00:00:12.692 --> 00:00:14.332]  Such an obvious success story.
[00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:15.852]  People are leaving California.
[00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:17.313]  They can go to 49 other places.
[00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:18.413]  They're coming to your state.
[00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.774]  That is an endorsement of the way you're running it, obviously.
[00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:23.714]  So, sincere congratulations.
[00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:25.275]  But I do have a question.
[00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:32.696]  We've seen this across the country, where people flee a collapsing, crummy state and then wreck the state they go to.
[00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:33.837]  Are you worried?
[00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:35.237]  Totally sincere question.
[00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:40.879]  That all these Californians will bring their values and degrade the state of Texas.
[00:00:42.519 --> 00:01:01.705]  Tucker, this is the number one question I get from fellow Texans all the time when they see all of these headquarters relocate from California to Texas and I have great news for them and that is these relocations are not going to change the politics in Texas and we have mathematical proof for it.
[00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:07.091]  Two years ago, I was on the ballot at the same time that Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke were on the ballot.
[00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:14.019]  We did an exit poll asking people after they left the polls, did you vote for Ted Cruz or did you vote for Beto O'Rourke?
[00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.264]  And then we asked them, have you moved from California or are you a native-born Texan?
[00:01:18.604 --> 00:01:24.986]  The results of that poll showed that 58% of the people who moved from California voted for Ted Cruz.
[00:01:25.386 --> 00:01:46.753]  Interestingly, that almost identically matches a separate poll that was taken, also an exit poll from that same election that showed that 57% of the people who moved from California voted for Ted Cruz, and both of those polls match a study that was done a couple of years before that that asked Californians that came to Texas, are you conservative or are you liberal?
[00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:52.037]  57% of the people who moved from California said they were conservative.
[00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:55.079]  27% of the people who moved from California said they were liberal.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.401]  And there are reasons for this, Tucker.
[00:01:57.922 --> 00:02:09.291]  And that is that if people like big government, if they like high taxes, if they like more regulations, they're going to stay in California and the last place they would come to is the state of Texas.
[00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:27.336]  But Tucker, I need to add this, because I talk to CEOs every single week, and I listen to their concerns, whether they're coming from California or New York or some other state, and they've added a new reason this year why they're coming to the state of Texas and leaving these other states, and that is because of the lack
[00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:28.076]  Yeah.
[00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:49.514]  Wait, may I interrupt you?
[00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:50.975]  I think you make really strong points.
[00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:52.195]  Those are clearly true.
[00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:54.336]  But there's another factor that's never considered.
[00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:58.818]  Texas is a great place in part because it's a very religious state.
[00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:03.340]  No one ever says that, but you go to Dallas and you know people are doing Bible study at Starbucks.
[00:03:04.568 --> 00:03:07.854]  The truth is there are massive cultural differences.
[00:03:07.874 --> 00:03:13.043]  You're getting a lot of people with left-wing social values moving into your state.
[00:03:13.063 --> 00:03:15.367]  They've already completely wrecked Austin, as you well know.
[00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:16.990]  You're not concerned about that?
[00:03:18.775 --> 00:03:28.585]  I'm not, again, in part because of the studies and also in part because of the thousands of Californians that I have personally dealt with that have come to the state of Texas.
[00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:40.938]  It's the Californians that they believe in God, they believe in guns, and they are so excited about coming to the state of Texas and getting a gun that they couldn't have in California, and so it's the people who want to
[00:03:41.238 --> 00:03:41.318]  It's
[00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.661]  Leaving Texas and going to California.
[00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:03.083]  So we have a kind of a trade deal going here.
[00:04:03.864 --> 00:04:08.087]  The liberals are leaving Texas and the conservatives are coming from California to Texas.
[00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:09.308]  I hope that's true.
[00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.491]  I should say, in the interest of full disclosure, I am from California.
[00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:17.275]  I'd be very wary of letting people like me in, but good luck.
[00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:19.717]  We're certainly, if Texas goes, then we're done.
[00:04:19.817 --> 00:04:22.059]  So please keep an eye on that.
[00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.140]  Governor, great to see you tonight.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.621]  Thank you.
[00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:24.902]  Thank you, Tucker.
[00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:38.357]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:04:38.457 --> 00:04:40.739]  You better believe you got one!
[00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:47.785]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.286]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, broadcasting worldwide on December 31st, 2020.
[00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:14.529]  I'll see you on the other side in the year 2021.
[00:05:16.971 --> 00:05:19.253]  Sounds like a science fiction headline, doesn't it?
[00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:19.774]  But we're here.
[00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:41.939]  The year 2021 is only hours away, and we have a powerful corporate world government trying to put in our bodies a mutagenic compound made up of human genomes and jellyfish genomes, just in the Pfizer vaccine alone, to reprogram the entire body.
[00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:47.605]  Now, what is this?
[00:05:48.165 --> 00:06:04.719]  Well, this really is the equivalent of an intruder cell with an entire genome of multiple species, a chimera, a chimera clone of a human and a jellyfish, coming in and assimilating your entire body.
[00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:08.943]  The jellyfish is a hive organism, a colony organism.
[00:06:10.128 --> 00:06:17.094]  It's a colony organism of human genomes going in and taking over every cell that replicates in your body.
[00:06:17.694 --> 00:06:24.700]  Only thing that will be the original you when it's done is the cells in your eyes and in the eggs in a woman's ovaries.
[00:06:26.021 --> 00:06:32.467]  All other cells are to be taken over.
[00:06:32.607 --> 00:06:34.208]  And it's all happening in the year 2021.
[00:06:34.408 --> 00:06:38.512]  It didn't come from some distant
[00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:42.685]  Galaxy.
[00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:48.290]  It didn't come from some distant star.
[00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.193]  It didn't come from some faraway planetary system.
[00:06:55.335 --> 00:06:58.317]  It came from the mad scientists here on our planet.
[00:06:58.437 --> 00:07:00.418]  But it is as alien as a Martian.
[00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:03.561]  It's as alien as somebody from Pluto.
[00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:10.926]  It's as alien as some single-cell organism in some planet orbiting Alpha Centauri or Betelgeuse.
[00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:24.845]  Cell intruder MRNA.
[00:07:26.365 --> 00:07:26.945]  Human cell.
[00:07:30.627 --> 00:07:31.007]  Inject.
[00:07:33.628 --> 00:07:34.148]  MRNA.
[00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:35.889]  Takeover.
[00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:37.890]  Assimilation completed.
[00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.172]  Now it looks like a human cell, but now it's owned by Microsoft.
[00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:47.896]  Which really owns large stock in all the big pharma companies.
[00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:56.542]  So Malaysia Complete Cell MMRA imitation cell now continues takeover.
[00:07:56.562 --> 00:08:09.412]  It only uncloaks to fire its messenger RNA in, takes over, and continues the process until every cell in your body has now been reprogrammed by your new doctor.
[00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.516]  Bill Gates.
[00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:18.690]  So that's the year 2021.
[00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:32.136]  Again, if flying saucers landed, like Mars Attacks, and little green men with eggheads came toddling off and began firing at us with ray guns, we'd whip their butts.
[00:08:33.397 --> 00:08:40.600]  We'd all unify like a team of heavily armed army ants, and we would destroy them.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.342]  No matter how many of us died, we'd win, because it'd be a big frontal assault.
[00:08:46.169 --> 00:09:01.284]  But when it comes from the UN and Davos Group, and the globalists, and it's the Save Us and Oh, it comes out of Wuhan, and Fauci and Gates ran the whole thing, but they always say the devil is in the old details.
[00:09:04.204 --> 00:09:05.424]  Oh, more deaths, by the way.
[00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:15.908]  Deaths in Spain, deaths in Israel, deaths in Switzerland, deaths, deaths, deaths from the new mRNA genetic takeover systems.
[00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:21.810]  Folks are taking it and they're dead in a couple hours.
[00:09:24.411 --> 00:09:32.294]  Well, hell, it's in the major medical studies that a lot of babies, especially preemies, they
[00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:40.565]  End up dying when they're given their vaccine.
[00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:45.046]  And the nurses have to fight with the bioethics board that runs the hospital.
[00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:46.527]  You don't know what bioethics are.
[00:09:46.547 --> 00:09:50.048]  You might want to find out about these boys and girls.
[00:09:50.428 --> 00:09:51.188]  They're eugenicists.
[00:09:51.208 --> 00:09:54.969]  The whole study of bioethics is just a field they created.
[00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:58.723]  Biological ethics, that's why they call us human resources.
[00:09:58.943 --> 00:09:59.803]  It's all hidden in plain view.
[00:10:00.443 --> 00:10:04.186]  And the nurses beg and say, can we please resuscitate them?
[00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:07.307]  Then the boards sometimes can't convene.
[00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:11.890]  And so they just order the baby to die and baby die.
[00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:15.772]  And they don't keep baby comfortable while they do it.
[00:10:17.253 --> 00:10:22.376]  So when we talk about Trump and the New World Order and the Communist Chinese and all that's going on, just remember,
[00:10:24.102 --> 00:10:35.907]  A million two hundred thousand Americans have taken one of two mRNA vaccines that up front are causing more bad reactions and more deaths than vaccines we've seen ever.
[00:10:38.668 --> 00:10:39.288]  And it's funny.
[00:10:39.348 --> 00:10:41.409]  Suddenly flu shots are killing a lot more people.
[00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:42.629]  Hundreds are dead.
[00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:44.330]  It was 59 first report.
[00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.931]  Now it's a couple hundred are dead.
[00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:48.652]  Now they're saying it's a state secret in South Korea.
[00:10:48.912 --> 00:10:49.872]  Don't want to create a panic.
[00:10:49.912 --> 00:10:51.913]  So now they're telling media don't report on it.
[00:10:53.305 --> 00:11:04.153]  And I've got articles here about people being arrested around the world, journalists that are critical of the vaccines and the rollout, and activists that try to organize protesting, like in Australia.
[00:11:04.473 --> 00:11:07.215]  They come to their house and they arrest you in your home.
[00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:13.559]  No, the New World Order's not coming.
[00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:14.340]  The New World Order's here.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.203]  So, in the new year, we're gonna take a lot more calls on this broadcast.
[00:11:19.223 --> 00:11:20.704]  We've been taking a lot more calls as of late.
[00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:21.785]  I've deliberate on that.
[00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:27.910]  We have the New American Journal, hosted by Harrison Smith, doing a splendid job.
[00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.230]  Weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:29.570]  Central.
[00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.211]  I also pop in, so does Owen Schroyer.
[00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:33.231]  That is a total call-in show.
[00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:40.132]  But the final transmission of the Alex Jones Show of the year 2020.
[00:11:41.713 --> 00:11:42.253]  What a year!
[00:11:42.273 --> 00:11:52.675]  I'd like to get your take on what you think is coming in the new year, and what your resolutions are in the new year, and what you think our focus should be in the new year.
[00:11:54.206 --> 00:11:55.226]  So that's all coming up.
[00:11:55.246 --> 00:11:56.306]  Let me give you the toll-free number.
[00:11:56.446 --> 00:11:56.986]  It's 877-789-ALEX.
[00:11:57.006 --> 00:11:57.166]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:11:57.187 --> 00:11:57.227]  877-789-2539.
[00:11:57.247 --> 00:12:02.187]  And let's give first-time callers the first round of calls, the first 20 calls or so.
[00:12:02.227 --> 00:12:04.128]  Then it's a free-for-all after that.
[00:12:04.148 --> 00:12:04.188]  877-789-2539.
[00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:04.368]  877-789-2539.
[00:12:04.488 --> 00:12:07.008]  And let's put nurses and doctors, if you can get through.
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.920]  To the head of the line.
[00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:30.463]  I'd like to hear from doctors and nurses about what you think about this carnage.
[00:12:30.503 --> 00:12:32.624]  And, oh, it doesn't even protect you from COVID.
[00:12:34.424 --> 00:12:36.045]  And, oh, it doesn't even stop you from spreading.
[00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:41.148]  And, oh, and people that took the shot two weeks ago, why, they are test positive for COVID now.
[00:12:42.608 --> 00:12:46.090]  And, yeah, more people are testing positive for HIV when you take the shot.
[00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.633]  Because, you see, the COVID virus is part HIV.
[00:12:56.479 --> 00:12:58.420]  There's a big video up on Bandot Video.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.080]  Doctors around the world issue dire warning.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.321]  Do not take the COVID vaccine.
[00:13:01.401 --> 00:13:06.003]  Medical doctors, scientists, epidemiologists, virologists, endocrinologists.
[00:13:07.803 --> 00:13:11.285]  And guess what happens to their videos when they go on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook?
[00:13:11.945 --> 00:13:15.606]  They get millions of views in just a few hours and then they get taken down.
[00:13:17.587 --> 00:13:20.909]  Because we don't get to hear from real medical doctors or scientists.
[00:13:20.969 --> 00:13:24.290]  We get to hear from Dr. Bill Gates.
[00:13:26.001 --> 00:13:37.330]  Who does say he wants to depopulate you, and whose father ran the World Eugenics Society, and whose mother was on the IBM board under the man that ran Nazi Germany.
[00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:41.253]  Thomas Watson.
[00:13:43.054 --> 00:13:44.295]  IBM and the Holocaust.
[00:13:44.335 --> 00:13:45.676]  Just search engine it for yourself.
[00:13:47.878 --> 00:13:50.920]  And don't hold your breath for the ADL to say a word.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.581]  The ADL works for these guys.
[00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:59.113]  See, when you're really the globalist and you're really the anti-humanist, you gotta own the whole show.
[00:13:59.153 --> 00:14:06.575]  That's what they set Hitler up for, was to create the paradigm paradox of Galian separation so people would know the real group when it hit them.
[00:14:09.755 --> 00:14:12.376]  If Hitler just would have worn a pink sweater, he would have won.
[00:14:13.376 --> 00:14:13.916]  Like Bill.
[00:14:15.536 --> 00:14:16.657]  Bill's got something for you.
[00:14:17.617 --> 00:14:18.397]  Wants you to take it.
[00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:22.588]  He says it's gonna hurt you real bad, but it's okay.
[00:14:23.089 --> 00:14:23.769]  We know you're tough.
[00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.171]  Infowars.com.
[00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:27.192]  Newswars.com.
[00:14:27.532 --> 00:14:29.414]  Banned, as in banned.
[00:14:29.814 --> 00:14:31.035]  Banned.video.
[00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:31.516]  Stay with us.
[00:14:32.076 --> 00:14:42.405]  Well, Luke Letlow just got elected to Congress, and then they said he died of COVID.
[00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:48.830]  But what happened is he went in, he tested positive for COVID, they did a, quote, surgery on him, and he had a heart attack and died.
[00:14:51.718 --> 00:14:54.541]  You gotta read the fine print, but they say he died of a heart attack.
[00:14:56.222 --> 00:15:02.468]  Well, 80-something-year-old Don Wells of Mary Ann fame of Gilligan's Island, one of my favorite silly shows.
[00:15:03.849 --> 00:15:05.711]  Some of my earliest memories are watching Gilligan's Island.
[00:15:07.813 --> 00:15:08.653]  Dies of COVID-19 at 82.
[00:15:08.693 --> 00:15:09.174]  Complications.
[00:15:12.193 --> 00:15:16.515]  That's right, you have a heart attack, you die of cancer, you die of pneumonia, it's complications.
[00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:17.635]  You know who else just died?
[00:15:18.315 --> 00:15:23.637]  It was the cellmate, up until the last day he was moved out, of Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:15:25.198 --> 00:15:29.319]  He was found dead in his apartment, and Lord have mercies, guess what?
[00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:30.459]  He died of COVID.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.442]  You know, if I was to die in a plane crash, or if you were, they'll say you died of COVID, or a motorcycle accident.
[00:15:38.462 --> 00:15:40.243]  This is all part of the formulaic fraud.
[00:15:42.093 --> 00:15:42.513]  They're running.
[00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:51.078]  They're also saying hospitals are full in Texas and New York and Hawaii and all over.
[00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:56.842]  And they're even arresting people now that go into the empty hospitals.
[00:15:56.882 --> 00:15:58.002]  So I want to be very, very clear.
[00:15:58.383 --> 00:16:00.244]  You need to go show the parking lot empty.
[00:16:00.664 --> 00:16:02.805]  You need to show the receiving area empty.
[00:16:02.845 --> 00:16:03.966]  You can shoot a time-lapse.
[00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.391]  If they tell you to leave, leave.
[00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:11.614]  But we've got multiple videos of people being arrested in the U.S.
[00:16:12.215 --> 00:16:12.935]  and the U.K.
[00:16:14.736 --> 00:16:15.697]  when they go to the hospitals.
[00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.519]  I don't think it violates, Seth, I don't think it violates privacy.
[00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:20.800]  This is a need to know.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.841]  The public has a right to know.
[00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:23.462]  That's covered by whistleblowing.
[00:16:23.502 --> 00:16:24.963]  It's covered by investigative journalism.
[00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:28.045]  But you just had a $10 million-plus judgment.
[00:16:29.773 --> 00:16:30.533]  I forget the exact number.
[00:16:30.553 --> 00:16:30.933]  Look it up.
[00:16:31.273 --> 00:16:42.836]  With this federal judge in San Francisco, on the folks that went undercover in restaurants, had the meetings with the Planned Parenthood groups that said, we've got live babies for you.
[00:16:44.817 --> 00:16:48.418]  And the judge gave them some, I think it was 16 million of memory serves.
[00:16:48.458 --> 00:16:49.318]  I saw that last week.
[00:16:49.338 --> 00:16:50.779]  I meant to cover it, but I was off.
[00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:56.020]  The headline was, uh, was the exact headline.
[00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:09.245]  Federal judge issues huge ruling against group that documented Planned Parenthood selling fetuses.
[00:17:10.766 --> 00:17:12.508]  They'll pull it up in a minute, or I will during the break.
[00:17:12.548 --> 00:17:12.948]  I'll find it.
[00:17:13.469 --> 00:17:16.732]  But the point is, is that that's what's going on here.
[00:17:18.173 --> 00:17:20.296]  They're trying to make it a crime.
[00:17:21.288 --> 00:17:26.914]  They're trying to make it a massive crime to expose their criminal activities.
[00:17:27.535 --> 00:17:29.557]  But listen, I don't need to go into the hospitals.
[00:17:29.597 --> 00:17:31.839]  No, we're going to be doing this this week and next week.
[00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:42.010]  I showed you the link two days ago to the CDC website where you can go look at every hospital in every town and every city.
[00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:42.751]  There it is.
[00:17:43.973 --> 00:17:49.415]  California judge orders video journals to pay $13.6 million to Planned Parenthood.
[00:17:50.055 --> 00:17:51.576]  I don't know why I thought $16 million.
[00:17:52.236 --> 00:17:53.557]  There you go.
[00:17:53.577 --> 00:17:54.157]  $13.6 million.
[00:17:54.177 --> 00:18:00.240]  I guess my mind remembered the $1.6, but it's $1.3.6.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:08.383]  $13.6 million to Planned Parenthood and they got undercover meetings at restaurants?
[00:18:10.418 --> 00:18:15.241]  We're Planned Parenthood's talking about buying themselves Ferraris for all the babies they sell?
[00:18:17.063 --> 00:18:32.654]  And now the mRNA vaccines don't just have part of babies in them, they have the entire genome, the Pfizer one does, of a dead boy that they've been cloning since 1966.
[00:18:38.032 --> 00:18:46.516]  You know, I remember I got on air 27 years ago and I'd be reading BBC articles about human animal cloning began 20 plus years ago and they would list where it began.
[00:18:46.536 --> 00:18:49.578]  And I remember even back then it was in the news.
[00:18:50.518 --> 00:18:52.359]  So I'd go, well, wait a minute, that's 27 years ago and it's 1995 or 1994, 1996.
[00:18:52.439 --> 00:18:56.281]  Then, you know, we're talking, this has been going on now 50 years.
[00:19:07.332 --> 00:19:11.955]  But they know because of the church and people's morals and common sense that people would want that outlawed.
[00:19:11.975 --> 00:19:16.819]  But it's all been going on right beneath the surface.
[00:19:20.081 --> 00:19:20.741]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:19:21.762 --> 00:19:22.963]  Too long segment's coming up.
[00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:30.208]  And I'm going to go right to your phone calls, Rick and Danny and Scott and Austin and Brian and many others, 877-789-2539.
[00:19:30.668 --> 00:19:36.352]  I want to hear from you about what President Trump needs to do, what you're going to be doing, what you expect next year.
[00:19:37.233 --> 00:19:38.914]  What happens if they do force Biden in?
[00:19:39.894 --> 00:19:43.416]  But let me tell you, there's a lot more election fraud coming out and big movements.
[00:19:43.736 --> 00:19:45.417]  Here's two of them we'll cover right now.
[00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:49.419]  Vice President Pence cancels planned January 6 trip to Israel.
[00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.160]  I've been harping on this for two days.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.721]  Just now getting attention.
[00:19:53.181 --> 00:19:55.202]  He was going to be gone on vacation.
[00:19:56.442 --> 00:20:03.426]  But now he's going to be back to oversee the debate in the Senate that could go on potentially not just for two hours, but for days.
[00:20:06.587 --> 00:20:11.295]  Somebody seize control of the Walmart account and attack Senator Josh Hawley.
[00:20:13.334 --> 00:20:14.715]  I don't think so.
[00:20:36.912 --> 00:20:50.358]  But Hawley is defending his decision to launch the contestant and to contest the election of Joe Biden by contesting the Electoral College results and blast Dems over their hypocrisy.
[00:20:52.299 --> 00:20:53.699]  So this all ties together.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.901]  All right, we are going to go to break.
[00:20:57.921 --> 00:20:59.262]  We're going to come back and hit all this.
[00:20:59.302 --> 00:21:01.843]  But let me tell you about some very, very exciting things that are happening.

[00:25:01.538 --> 00:25:06.899]  Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away.

[00:25:41.704 --> 00:25:48.137]  But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.
[00:25:57.774 --> 00:26:00.777]  Wow, that's a powerful video that our own Darren McBrain put together.
[00:26:01.057 --> 00:26:03.339]  Again, for Radio listeners, you've got to hear a great Johnny Cash song.
[00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:05.260]  I want to go to your phone calls now.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.441]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:11.445]  We've got Steve, we've got Rick, we've got Danny, we've got Scott, Austin, Charles, Robert, Kevin, and so many others.
[00:26:12.046 --> 00:26:22.455]  Austin's mother teaches nursing, got the Pfizer COVID vaccine, he's got a report to give us, and then we've got a wife is a doctor, hospitals raking in millions on COVID.
[00:26:23.171 --> 00:26:35.202]  I don't just have to believe Robert, even USA Today says $53,000 on top of what you get paid by the insurance or whatever, or by their payment, when you've got a COVID patient, you intubate.
[00:26:35.943 --> 00:26:43.770]  When you intubate, you get higher death rates, but there are 75 people, I kept saying 77, I don't know why, the statistics, as of a few days ago when I covered it, 77
[00:26:45.831 --> 00:26:46.571]  Was the number I said.
[00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:57.234]  75 is what the CDC reported and the Austin American Station reported in the town I live of almost 2 million people in the hospital with COVID.
[00:26:57.254 --> 00:26:57.234]  75.
[00:26:57.574 --> 00:27:03.016]  And they're saying the hospitals are full, everyone's dead, run for the hills, my God, don't ever leave your house again!
[00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:05.640]  Hey Alex, thanks so much for taking my call.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.701]  I hope everybody's having a good New Year's Eve.
[00:27:33.933 --> 00:27:35.795]  Yeah, you touched on it a little bit earlier, Alex.
[00:27:35.975 --> 00:27:39.679]  My mother, she teaches nursing at a Division I university in Tennessee.
[00:27:39.739 --> 00:27:44.003]  I won't go too much further into that, just because I do want to protect her identity.
[00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:47.546]  But she has been in the nursing field for over 25 years.
[00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:54.633]  She has her doctorate, she teaches nursing, and she works in the emergency room here in the COVID unit.
[00:27:55.291 --> 00:28:00.355]  And Alex, she did receive the Pfizer vaccine, the first shot, about a week and a half ago.
[00:28:00.796 --> 00:28:04.239]  And she did let me know that she's due up for that second shot.
[00:28:04.379 --> 00:28:10.724]  And that is the injection that has been causing a lot of issues, from what I understand, is that second shot, Alex.
[00:28:10.784 --> 00:28:11.705]  Because as of right now,
[00:28:12.626 --> 00:28:18.611]  She feels fine, Lord bless her soul, but that second shot has been what has been raising concerns.
[00:28:18.651 --> 00:28:29.902]  Now we know why with the Pfizer, according to Wolfgang Wudarg, who's a prestigious scientist and heads up an EU advisory commission, and his associate that signed on to it, the former chief science officer at Pfizer.
[00:28:30.996 --> 00:28:41.561]  That the mRNA goes in, starts taking over your cells, and in a few weeks, then your body has an autoimmune response when you get injected the next time that's very violent.
[00:28:41.861 --> 00:28:49.285]  And Gates is talking about five shots, and many experts believe that you will have a large portion of people die by the fourth or fifth shot.
[00:28:49.605 --> 00:28:51.426]  What does your mother, who's a nurse's nurse, think?
[00:28:52.950 --> 00:29:09.480]  Well, you know, early on in the whole COVID thing, Alex, you know, she was very open about how the hospitals were being incentivized to house COVID patients to, you know, they were getting huge, huge amounts of money, Alex, just for innovating COVID patients.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.042]  But they weren't nearly as busy as they were trying to make people believe.
[00:29:13.102 --> 00:29:18.765]  I mean, there were evenings where my mother would come home, supposed to be coming home midnight, 1 a.m., and she would come home 8 or 9 p.m.
[00:29:18.825 --> 00:29:21.387]  because it was just a slower night at the emergency room.
[00:29:21.806 --> 00:29:23.268]  But Alex, she just has a great heart.
[00:29:23.308 --> 00:29:24.389]  She wants to help people.
[00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:28.434]  And at the beginning, she kind of understood that this was a little bit bigger of a hoax.
[00:29:28.474 --> 00:29:36.984]  But I believe now that these nurses are starting to get these vaccines, and they're kind of, you know, they're at the risk of losing their jobs to deny this vaccine.
[00:29:37.024 --> 00:29:41.509]  And for people like my mother, who have been in the medical field for 25 years, who teach
[00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:53.557]  No, I totally understand.
[00:29:53.617 --> 00:29:54.978]  It's killing yourself to live.
[00:29:55.519 --> 00:29:59.161]  It's a cult where they make you do this to yourself to have a job or they pressure you into it.
[00:29:59.481 --> 00:30:04.385]  And once they have the enforcers, the nurses, the doctors, the police are made to do it, they'll make us do it.
[00:30:04.685 --> 00:30:09.168]  That's why we've got to stand with the nurses, the majority of which in polls say they do not want the vaccines.
[00:30:09.449 --> 00:30:10.950]  Thank you so much and God bless you, Austin.
[00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:13.311]  Let's talk to Robert in California.
[00:30:13.351 --> 00:30:18.232]  His wife's a doctor, says hospitals raking in millions per hospital on COVID.
[00:30:18.252 --> 00:30:18.992]  Tell us about it, Robert.
[00:30:20.593 --> 00:30:21.373]  Hi, Alex.
[00:30:21.813 --> 00:30:33.557]  Yeah, she's a physician in Southern California at a hospital, and the largest portion of the COVID patients are right now about 400, and that's a pretty large population.
[00:30:33.577 --> 00:30:34.917]  Now, if you do the math on that,
[00:30:35.546 --> 00:30:40.249]  You're looking at $4 million of the base fee for these admissions.
[00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.912]  And that's, on the average, every seven days.
[00:30:44.372 --> 00:30:45.553]  Could be every seven days.
[00:30:45.793 --> 00:30:53.519]  If they just admit them, declare them as COVID, treat them for a broken toe, and roll them back out the door, they have a revolving door.
[00:30:53.799 --> 00:30:55.981]  It's like a slot machine at the casino.
[00:30:56.341 --> 00:31:01.265]  And if only 30% of those are incubated, that's another $1.5 million.
[00:31:01.545 --> 00:31:02.846]  And how long does that last?
[00:31:03.365 --> 00:31:06.427]  Well, the human body under intubation isn't going to last that long.
[00:31:06.487 --> 00:31:08.648]  So, well, I'm very concerned about that.
[00:31:23.658 --> 00:31:30.781]  You'll be demonized and then they say intubate at an even higher level than normal knowing when you're having an autoimmune response it kills you.
[00:31:31.061 --> 00:31:32.141]  It's not fluid in the lungs.
[00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:33.322]  It's the opposite of what they need.
[00:31:33.342 --> 00:31:34.162]  They need Benadryl.
[00:31:34.402 --> 00:31:35.282]  They need steroids.
[00:31:35.402 --> 00:31:39.484]  I've had doctors on 100% success rate with these steroids instantly.
[00:31:39.724 --> 00:31:44.645]  I mean, we're talking in 20 minutes, they have you breathe these steroids, boom, you start having the autoimmune response.
[00:31:44.965 --> 00:32:01.369]  Instead, they're giving you a vaccine that makes you have an autoimmune response to other coronaviruses that are the most common, and that's what the top scientists, Wolfgang Wudarg and others have warned, it's gonna cause massive new allergies to normal, non-harmful viruses.
[00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:04.790]  So it looks like what they're doing, stay there, I'm gonna let you finish up, Robert.
[00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:09.833]  Is making you allergic to your normal environment so you can't live in a normal environment.
[00:32:10.133 --> 00:32:15.156]  And that's what you're already seeing is people that are getting the vaccine are suddenly getting regular colds and dying.
[00:32:16.357 --> 00:32:16.737]  Wow.
[00:32:17.638 --> 00:32:23.401]  They are taking your immune system away, which is exactly what Wolfgang Wudarg warned in that report three weeks ago to the EU on.
[00:32:23.421 --> 00:32:23.662]  Remember?
[00:32:23.682 --> 00:32:24.462]  Remember?
[00:32:25.103 --> 00:32:26.744]  Four weeks ago, December 1st, he filed it.
[00:32:27.044 --> 00:32:28.665]  He said this will cause an autoimmune response.
[00:32:29.827 --> 00:32:34.430]  This is the number one anti-globulus pro-human transmission on Earth.
[00:32:35.071 --> 00:32:36.432]  It's powered by we, the people.
[00:32:37.713 --> 00:32:39.894]  It's powered by you taking action.
[00:32:39.914 --> 00:32:47.800]  It's powered by your prayer, by your word of mouth, and by you getting great products that support the M4 and support yourself and your family at m4warstore.com.
[00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:57.708]  You know, I knew this and I'd read this, but I'd forgotten this, because when I say they get $53,000 for every COVID patient they intubate,
[00:32:58.723 --> 00:32:59.643]  They put on a respirator.
[00:32:59.663 --> 00:33:04.145]  A ventilator, as the governor of New York calls it.
[00:33:05.326 --> 00:33:06.366]  But I'd forgotten this.
[00:33:06.386 --> 00:33:07.407]  Here's the Hill newspaper.
[00:33:07.647 --> 00:33:08.207]  Analysis.
[00:33:09.548 --> 00:33:14.049]  Some states getting $300,000 per coronavirus case.
[00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:16.631]  New York getting $12K.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:44.905]  So if you wonder why there's an incentive to keep this hoax, this exaggeration, this fraud going, and why we've had medical doctors and nurses on who show the video of the computer screens in the hospitals where someone doesn't even have COVID-19, even the fake PCR test says they don't have it, and they grab them and snake a tube down their lungs and kill their ass.
[00:33:47.466 --> 00:33:50.288]  Because if you don't need to be on a respirator, folks, it'll kill you.
[00:33:50.888 --> 00:33:54.451]  It's a very desperate move to do when someone's lungs aren't working anymore.
[00:33:54.471 --> 00:34:02.696]  I remember my uncle, God bless him, what a great guy, couldn't breathe, had really bad pneumonia six, almost seven years ago.
[00:34:03.397 --> 00:34:06.158]  He died in, I guess January, coming up.
[00:34:07.139 --> 00:34:09.120]  Seven years ago, it was seven years, about 20-something days.
[00:34:10.501 --> 00:34:12.863]  And man, he did not want to go on a ventilator.
[00:34:14.205 --> 00:34:21.249]  And he was having trouble breathing and they did it and he was dead in three days after they snaked that thing down his lungs.
[00:34:22.189 --> 00:34:23.770]  And boy, he was strapped down.
[00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.111]  He was fighting to get out of that.
[00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:27.652]  I remember sitting there watching it.
[00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:29.013]  It was putting years on my life.
[00:34:29.053 --> 00:34:30.013]  Just watching him sit there.
[00:34:30.814 --> 00:34:33.035]  He's just looking at me, basically begging to get out of that thing.
[00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:35.576]  But without it, he'd have died right then.
[00:34:36.737 --> 00:34:37.697]  But it's still, he died.
[00:34:39.098 --> 00:34:39.258]  Ugh.
[00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:40.579]  Now,
[00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.310]  Some horrible memories.
[00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.371]  I shouldn't open those memories up.
[00:34:46.811 --> 00:34:50.292]  But that's what they're doing, folks, just like this newly elected congressman.
[00:34:51.773 --> 00:34:55.294]  He had a heart attack when they were doing the intubation procedure.
[00:34:57.174 --> 00:34:58.255]  Imagine, he's strapped down.
[00:34:58.275 --> 00:35:00.175]  It's like being waterboarded.
[00:35:00.195 --> 00:35:04.797]  They run those tubes down into your bronchioles, into your lungs.
[00:35:06.097 --> 00:35:10.919]  You ever had a little piece of rice go down your throat the wrong way and you're hacking and coughing, your eyes are bloodshot?
[00:35:11.837 --> 00:35:15.681]  You know what it's like if you're not unconscious and they stick tubes down your lungs?
[00:35:19.165 --> 00:35:21.668]  And most of the people that have died have been old people or homeless.
[00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:28.496]  They scoop those homeless up at certain hospitals have almost all the death and they're killing them folks.
[00:35:28.816 --> 00:35:32.521]  And you'll notice it's the same hospitals that kill the babies and sell their organs.
[00:35:34.636 --> 00:35:44.019]  There it is, 80% Business Insider of New York City's coronavirus patients who are put on ventilators ultimately die, and some doctors are trying to stop using them.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.181]  That was months and months and months and months and months and months ago, back in April.
[00:35:52.162 --> 00:35:55.943]  That's why the left's so pissed, because most hospitals know not to use the ventilators now.
[00:35:55.963 --> 00:35:57.664]  Remember Cuomo?
[00:35:58.064 --> 00:36:03.846]  We need testing, testing, testing, ventilators, ventilators, ventilators.
[00:36:05.009 --> 00:36:05.890]  Because he's told to say that.
[00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.111]  Now it's testing, testing, testing.
[00:36:08.431 --> 00:36:10.453]  Ventilator, ventilator, ventilator.
[00:36:10.753 --> 00:36:12.514]  Arrest, arrest, arrest.
[00:36:12.974 --> 00:36:13.755]  I have Schumer.
[00:36:14.475 --> 00:36:15.216]  I have Whitmer.
[00:36:15.676 --> 00:36:16.377]  I have Wolf.
[00:36:16.777 --> 00:36:17.577]  I have Cuomo.
[00:36:18.078 --> 00:36:19.118]  I have Newsom.
[00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:20.359]  All on video.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.822]  Newsom with that big Jack O'Lantern demon face.
[00:36:24.864 --> 00:36:26.285]  I'd run from that guy if I saw him in an alley.
[00:36:26.325 --> 00:36:26.865]  He scares me.
[00:36:27.005 --> 00:36:33.008]  He's a... People that don't have the sight, don't have discernment, don't know, like, that's a... Whoa, that's an actual killer level demon.
[00:36:33.028 --> 00:36:35.950]  That's about as bad as... That's Satan's helper right there.
[00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.791]  That's... I mean, Cuomo, open demon, look at him.
[00:36:39.972 --> 00:36:41.252]  Brian Stelter, open demon.
[00:36:43.493 --> 00:36:44.334]  They've got the look.
[00:36:44.734 --> 00:36:46.375]  Jimmy Savelle's got the look.
[00:36:47.135 --> 00:36:48.516]  Pull up Jimmy Savelle for folks.
[00:36:49.056 --> 00:36:49.917]  He's got the look.
[00:36:50.057 --> 00:36:50.937]  He's got the look.
[00:36:51.117 --> 00:36:51.918]  He's got the look.
[00:36:52.833 --> 00:36:53.994]  I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[00:36:54.014 --> 00:36:59.957]  I'm saying if I was going to cast one for Hollywood to play one, Brian Steldred would be number one.
[00:36:59.977 --> 00:37:01.557]  Hit the clown, no makeup needed.
[00:37:02.018 --> 00:37:04.299]  But he sure as hell molested the truth all day in the First Amendment.
[00:37:05.639 --> 00:37:11.102]  So I'm going to go back to Robert here and the rest of your calls, but the big news coming up next hour, Lin Wood files emergency petition to the U.S.
[00:37:11.122 --> 00:37:14.064]  Supreme Court to stop January 5th runoff races in the U.S.
[00:37:14.104 --> 00:37:16.105]  Senate in Georgia, which Trump should have done.
[00:37:16.465 --> 00:37:18.286]  Those are sitting in the same fake ballots.
[00:37:20.708 --> 00:37:24.552]  They're engaged in the same fraud again, and if we let them do it, they'll do it again!
[00:37:24.572 --> 00:37:30.459]  But right now, let's go back to Robert.
[00:37:30.499 --> 00:37:33.041]  Robert, your wife's a doctor, hospital's raking in millions.
[00:37:33.762 --> 00:37:35.084]  What is your take on this?
[00:37:35.124 --> 00:37:35.965]  What is her take on this?
[00:37:37.168 --> 00:37:41.111]  Well, we're very concerned about all these first responders getting the vax first.
[00:37:41.571 --> 00:37:51.018]  I mean, if you really consider what a better way to seize a country is, classic poison the meat under siege and then send it in as humanitarian relief.
[00:37:51.438 --> 00:37:53.579]  Then you watch your enemy fall by their own hand.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:54.280]  I mean,
[00:37:54.930 --> 00:38:01.858]  If all these first responders go down because they took a poison piece of meat, next thing you know, who's going to step up to the plate to save us?
[00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:04.702]  Well, the guys that are saving the rest of the third world countries.
[00:38:05.002 --> 00:38:07.265]  China, the WHO, and the UN.
[00:38:07.545 --> 00:38:14.974]  They'll move right in as humanitarian relief, and ain't going to be nobody here, especially the politicians in Washington, to stop them.
[00:38:15.294 --> 00:38:18.076]  They'll just spread their legs and let them come right on in.
[00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:19.317]  You just said it.
[00:38:19.377 --> 00:38:21.659]  You wonder why the blue cities are bankrupting everything.
[00:38:21.939 --> 00:38:24.201]  You wonder why there's feces in homeless camps everywhere.
[00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:26.983]  You wonder why they're trying to debase the dollar and trying to bankrupt it.
[00:38:27.003 --> 00:38:35.409]  They say to bring the country down, to bring us into receivership under world government, and now China officially in their newspaper says, we released COVID.
[00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:39.412]  They just say COVID was released by God out of China, being the Communist Party.
[00:38:39.992 --> 00:38:40.893]  It hit America.
[00:38:41.053 --> 00:38:42.294]  We control America.
[00:38:42.535 --> 00:38:43.716]  They will never reopen.
[00:38:43.816 --> 00:38:44.817]  America is done.
[00:38:45.437 --> 00:38:47.459]  And the average American thinks, I'll wear my mask.
[00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:48.420]  I'll do what I'm told.
[00:38:48.721 --> 00:38:49.521]  This will all end.
[00:38:49.662 --> 00:38:50.622]  No, it never ends.
[00:38:51.103 --> 00:38:52.885]  The masks don't come off until you take them off.
[00:38:52.925 --> 00:38:54.566]  The businesses don't open until you open them.
[00:38:54.867 --> 00:38:56.028]  But China is bragging.
[00:38:56.048 --> 00:38:58.170]  They're totally open, partying, no mask.
[00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.870]  It was all a hoax.
[00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:05.235]  And they control the globalists, and the chi-coms are in league with big tech, and the big tech takeover.
[00:39:05.415 --> 00:39:18.825]  That's why they censor you if you tell the truth, it's why they try to block you, it's why they block the doctors, because this is their mind control, chicken little takeover, where people never leave their houses and go bankrupt for the globalists to take over and receivership.
[00:39:19.045 --> 00:39:22.868]  What you said is one trillion gazillion infinity true, Robert.
[00:39:24.076 --> 00:39:24.716]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:24.796 --> 00:39:30.077]  And just if I may make a short plug for bodies, DNA, and vitamin mineral fusion.
[00:39:30.758 --> 00:39:36.919]  I have suffered gout for years and then I started taking this and about month three it started going away.
[00:39:36.959 --> 00:39:38.039]  That was three years ago.
[00:39:38.099 --> 00:39:39.339]  I hadn't seen gout since.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.520]  So all you gout sufferers out there, check it out.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.841]  How fast did it kick in?
[00:39:44.721 --> 00:39:50.202]  You know, it took about six months, but the flares each month, I used to suffer two flares a month.
[00:39:50.666 --> 00:39:58.260]  That went down to one, and after six months, I started to have the twinge, but after three years, I haven't had full-blown gout since then.
[00:39:59.684 --> 00:40:05.369]  Well, who knows what it was you were deficient in, but if you're deficient, that's where all this stuff, that's why it's called essential.
[00:40:05.609 --> 00:40:10.733]  Iodine's essential, D3's essential, C's essential, B12, it's all essential.
[00:40:11.414 --> 00:40:12.895]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:40:13.436 --> 00:40:17.339]  Again, something like turmeric, where it's 95% curcuminoid, we have the strongest one out there.
[00:40:17.659 --> 00:40:21.382]  It's got basically everything in one pill, but different strokes for different folks.
[00:40:21.442 --> 00:40:23.124]  Thank you so much, brother, and God bless you.
[00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:26.260]  He's absolutely right, folks.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.340]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.561]  It's not something we're saying.
[00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:29.701]  It's a U.N.
[00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:31.662]  world government takeover where the U.N.'
[00:40:31.642 --> 00:40:33.483]  's the boss with the CHICOMS.
[00:40:34.023 --> 00:40:39.846]  They're now saying everybody's got to go to sensitivity training to have any job, to be taught that America's bad and you're bad.
[00:40:40.126 --> 00:40:42.608]  The whole country's an open air re-education camp.
[00:40:44.789 --> 00:40:46.970]  And they've got all these compliant sheep going along.
[00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:48.271]  They were always going to be sheep.
[00:40:48.911 --> 00:40:50.912]  We've got to be leaders and put our foot down.
[00:40:51.632 --> 00:40:53.853]  Angela in Arizona, you're on the air.
[00:40:53.953 --> 00:40:54.574]  Thanks for calling.
[00:40:55.384 --> 00:41:00.146]  Hi Alex, you asked for New Year's regulations, and I thought I'd just give you mine.
[00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:01.006]  Yes please.
[00:41:01.106 --> 00:41:08.409]  And it's to raise my children in a Christian world, in the free country that I grew up in.
[00:41:09.449 --> 00:41:18.693]  And I'm not going to let anyone harm a hair on their head, and God will, and I'll live 110 and tell my great-grandchildren how Jesus was the one who saved us from Satan, his followers.
[00:41:19.341 --> 00:41:29.849]  This medical technocratic tyranny is real, but so is Jesus, and I'll never submit to the satanic new world order, and I just want to say I pray for you, and in fours, and God bless you all.
[00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.150]  I pray for you.
[00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:31.851]  Thank you, Angela.
[00:41:31.871 --> 00:41:32.631]  What a beautiful voice.
[00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:35.614]  And think about this, and I mean this when I say it.
[00:41:35.694 --> 00:41:41.218]  Praise the living God, that we are of the living God who created the universe.
[00:41:41.238 --> 00:41:46.122]  This is the evil Satan fallen trying to play God, and it's ridiculous, and it's a joke.
[00:41:47.315 --> 00:41:48.195]  He hates free will.
[00:41:48.276 --> 00:41:49.736]  He wants omnipresent control.
[00:41:49.796 --> 00:41:51.237]  He wants robots that serve him.
[00:41:51.797 --> 00:41:53.758]  And it's all being manifest.
[00:41:53.798 --> 00:41:54.639]  It's all being proven.
[00:41:54.659 --> 00:41:55.519]  It's all being fulfilled.
[00:41:55.559 --> 00:41:56.440]  It's all real.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:03.544]  And I gotta tell you, as the evil intensifies, my discernment has kicked up so high now.
[00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:06.710]  That I don't even get into it on air.
[00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:07.511]  I can't even handle it.
[00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:09.431]  It's like the blueprints to everything.
[00:42:09.492 --> 00:42:12.273]  It's like how everything works, the knowledge, what's gonna happen next.
[00:42:12.353 --> 00:42:13.033]  I can't even handle it.
[00:42:13.473 --> 00:42:20.357]  Like all night long, my dreams, when I wake up in the morning, I'm just so energized that I don't even feel like I'm worthy to be on air because I can't even articulate it all.
[00:42:20.377 --> 00:42:21.757]  But I can see the matrix now.
[00:42:22.218 --> 00:42:23.178]  I know you can see it now.
[00:42:23.218 --> 00:42:25.679]  The enemy's panicking as we all begin to see the code.
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:31.162]  And when you see the code, you see it's Satan projected this in front of us and God's right on the other side.
[00:42:31.442 --> 00:42:32.883]  We are piercing the veil together.
[00:42:48.618 --> 00:42:52.800]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:43:05.505]  As we prepare to close out the nightmare year of 2020, it's important to understand the forces behind COVID-19 and its deadly rollout.
[00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:18.565]  The Associated Press and every other major establishment publication that you can find are telling us over and over and over again that COVID-19 conquered the world.
[00:43:21.237 --> 00:43:23.998]  The COVID-19 took over the world.
[00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:35.524]  The COVID-19 is causing tens of millions to starve to death and sending hundreds of millions and even billions towards the edge of starvation and complete poverty.
[00:43:36.184 --> 00:43:43.208]  It is a 100% verifiable fact that that is a hoax and that that is a fraud.
[00:43:44.168 --> 00:43:48.991]  It is the lockdown in response to COVID-19 that's triggering the global depression.
[00:43:49.612 --> 00:44:07.824]  It's the lockdown in response to the media-driven and governmental-driven and medical-driven hysteria about COVID-19 that is triggering this worldwide depression that is irrevocably savaging infrastructure built up over the last 200 years in the planet's civilization.
[00:44:08.284 --> 00:44:13.808]  Understanding who the forces are behind the COVID-19 orchestrated hysteria
[00:44:14.348 --> 00:44:14.668]  I think?
[00:44:31.576 --> 00:44:44.104]  that codified this sustainability post-industrial plan of the last 30 years, their chief engineer and science officer carrying out the operation being Klaus Schwab.
[00:44:44.665 --> 00:44:58.954]  Working with Bill Gates and other top globalists, Klaus Schwab, through the UN, has been able to take over almost every major governmental medical decision-making process, putting the United Nations, Big Pharma,
[00:44:59.454 --> 00:45:05.980]  Big Tech and other global corporations in control of seven and a half billion people's medical future.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:16.609]  Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab are on record saying COVID-19 is only a pretext or a drill for the planetary takeover of every aspect of human life.
[00:45:17.009 --> 00:45:25.096]  Global social credit scores, tracking apps on all your phones, having to register online before you even leave your house or go to the grocery store.
[00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:27.199]  This is the technocracy.
[00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:35.409]  This is the global social credit score being hailed by Xi Jinping, now being adopted worldwide by Western nations.
[00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:42.098]  The United Nations, Schwab, Bill Gates, the Communist Chinese are all in an admitted consortium.
[00:45:42.719 --> 00:45:51.602]  Developing and agreeing upon a planetary world standardized ID barcode and QR code tracking system during phase one.
[00:45:52.203 --> 00:46:00.646]  Phase two is liquid nanochips in the vaccine itself proving that you've been vaccinated which then doubles as your medical passport.
[00:46:01.046 --> 00:46:05.628]  It is critical for you to understand that none of this is my opinion.
[00:46:06.308 --> 00:46:11.510]  The globalists have all written books and white papers detailing this takeover plan
[00:46:12.458 --> 00:46:13.538]  For more than 40 years.
[00:46:14.219 --> 00:46:23.642]  And a decade ago, under Operation Lockstep, the Rockefellers detailed the specific plan and the specific attack that we are now under via the Great Reset.
[00:46:24.122 --> 00:46:38.947]  Bill Gates, Xi Jinping, Klaus Schwab, Prince Charles and others are on record saying COVID-19 is the pretext for their Great Reset to end the industrialized world as we know it and lower the human population by at least 80%.
[00:46:41.088 --> 00:47:03.339]  If they are successful carrying out their global COVID takeover, using the fear of the virus as the pretext for their authoritarianism, this will be the greatest crime and the greatest mass murder and the greatest redistribution of wealth from the common people and the poor to the so-called global elites the planet has ever seen.
[00:47:04.229 --> 00:47:06.311]  This is modern warfare.
[00:47:06.951 --> 00:47:19.240]  This is global corporations establishing a world government to counter a global crisis of hysteria they have created based on COVID, from which you never get out of the crisis.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.781]  They only expand the crisis.
[00:47:20.801 --> 00:47:22.502]  Alright, there's full reports at Banned.Video.
[00:47:22.722 --> 00:47:25.724]  It's a good one to give people because I cover everything in one big swath.
[00:47:26.285 --> 00:47:27.966]  It's at Banned.Video.
[00:47:28.066 --> 00:47:29.567]  Banned.Video.
[00:47:29.627 --> 00:47:31.829]  Get it out to everyone you know.
[00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:36.192]  It's my final broadcast of 2020, official Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:36.212 --> 00:47:42.838]  I'm going to be up here tonight, co-hosting a live stream with Tim Dillon, the comedian.
[00:47:43.679 --> 00:47:52.046]  And who knows, I might twitch the arm of some of the crew, stay up here with me, maybe do a little live transmission over the feeds as we bring in the new year.
[00:47:53.117 --> 00:47:53.437]  That's right.
[00:48:06.124 --> 00:48:11.385]  To arrest and detain anyone they want if they're coughing, have a runny nose, or a fever.
[00:48:12.026 --> 00:48:21.968]  And they'll just disappear you into a medical tyranny facility and intubate you with a new guillotine that is known as a ventilator, and then say that you've died of COVID-19.
[00:48:21.988 --> 00:48:25.909]  Kind of like Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate found dead in his house, COVID.
[00:48:26.929 --> 00:48:30.130]  The new congressman who just got elected had a heart attack, COVID.
[00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:32.631]  Just, it's, he got hit by a car.
[00:48:33.695 --> 00:48:36.618]  You're, I guess, killed on death row by lethal injection.
[00:48:37.259 --> 00:48:38.200]  They'll just say COVID.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:43.185]  So we're taking phone calls on your New Year's resolution, what you see coming.
[00:48:43.245 --> 00:48:46.148]  Do you think Trump's going to be able to still squeeze this out?
[00:48:46.168 --> 00:48:47.389]  I know they're not giving briefings.
[00:48:48.527 --> 00:48:51.169]  Still, to Joe Biden, he's getting very, very upset.
[00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:54.872]  Massive evidence of fraud is just stacking up continually.
[00:48:54.912 --> 00:49:06.281]  There's a lot of big state houses that are having hearings and saying they want signature verification and saying that they think the full legislature should come in and that there's clear evidence that Trump really won the election.
[00:49:07.522 --> 00:49:11.966]  In all five of those states, he was winning big by two, three, four, five percentage points.
[00:49:12.847 --> 00:49:16.510]  Hundreds of thousands of votes, half a million votes until they closed.
[00:49:17.335 --> 00:49:18.956]  And then the magic happened.
[00:49:19.596 --> 00:49:33.464]  The black briefcases, the black suitcases came out from under the tables and everybody was kicked out and the magic time happened and the giant spikes for Biden with the videos in Georgia and other states of them counting the same stacks over and over again.
[00:49:34.024 --> 00:49:41.108]  It's not enough to have ten suitcases that you kick everybody out, you pull out from underneath the black tablecloth.
[00:49:42.637 --> 00:49:47.379]  You then gotta run each stack over and over and over again as many times as you can.
[00:49:47.399 --> 00:49:50.881]  And then bingo, everything goes good.
[00:49:52.162 --> 00:49:55.023]  Then you just have the national news say, not any evidence of fraud.
[00:49:55.523 --> 00:49:58.405]  And as the evidence of fraud comes out, they go, well, not widespread.
[00:49:58.985 --> 00:50:00.886]  Even though it's the same scam in every state.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.381]  So the globalists are going for broke.
[00:50:04.921 --> 00:50:07.103]  Lin Wood files emergency petition in U.S.
[00:50:07.123 --> 00:50:10.645]  Supreme Court to stop January 5th runoff races for U.S.
[00:50:10.685 --> 00:50:19.290]  Senate in Georgia, citing the fraud, citing that they're still using fake mail-in ballots that aren't being verified, signatures not being verified.
[00:50:20.211 --> 00:50:25.914]  You've got all the different Democratic Party operatives there ruling as judges to allow all this to happen.
[00:50:25.954 --> 00:50:28.696]  This is really a dangerous situation.
[00:50:31.001 --> 00:50:33.142]  He also says he will file a petition with the U.S.
[00:50:33.162 --> 00:50:35.463]  Supreme Court in the Georgia election case.
[00:50:35.963 --> 00:50:37.223]  So there is a lot going on.
[00:50:37.263 --> 00:50:39.924]  Here is the petition, the beginning of the petition.
[00:50:42.185 --> 00:50:55.790]  Petitioner asked for an emergency order restraining respondents to halt the January 5, 2021 senatorial runoff election until such time as respondents agreed to comply with Georgia legislature's prescribed election procedures.
[00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:57.950]  Again, they're not even following the law.
[00:50:58.251 --> 00:50:58.971]  It's totally illegal.
[00:50:59.784 --> 00:51:02.566]  The Supreme Court has a cut-and-dry case here, but they won't take it, I bet.
[00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:03.807]  Or they'll overturn it.
[00:51:04.507 --> 00:51:11.672]  Petitioners further request that this court direct the District Court to order production of all registration dates.
[00:51:12.654 --> 00:51:15.015]  And by the way, they've had now... I'll get to this after I take calls.
[00:51:34.699 --> 00:51:44.123]  Some of the top respected MIT and Stanford Research Institute scientists come out and say, we've looked at the raw data, total fraud.
[00:51:45.644 --> 00:51:51.027]  And we've looked at the Dominion machines, they're designed for fraud, just like the last forensic group found in Michigan.
[00:51:51.247 --> 00:51:53.348]  They said this is a backdoor machine.
[00:51:54.048 --> 00:51:55.889]  This is a Swiss cheese operation.
[00:51:56.169 --> 00:51:58.230]  This is a submarine with screen doors on it.
[00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:04.590]  This is a jumbo jet with no glass in the windows.
[00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:07.212]  I mean, this dog is a fraud.
[00:52:07.292 --> 00:52:08.353]  This dog does not hunt.
[00:52:09.454 --> 00:52:10.915]  Unless scamming is what you're looking for.
[00:52:10.935 --> 00:52:16.359]  So all the top eggheads say what we've already noticed with our eyeballs.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.923]  That this is as crooked as a barrel of snakes.
[00:52:22.324 --> 00:52:23.565]  Alright, let's go to your calls now.
[00:52:24.445 --> 00:52:26.227]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[00:52:27.228 --> 00:52:28.348]  That would be...
[00:52:30.492 --> 00:52:31.513]  Kevin in New Jersey.
[00:52:31.553 --> 00:52:32.493]  Kevin, thanks for holding.
[00:52:32.533 --> 00:52:32.853]  Welcome.
[00:52:34.414 --> 00:52:35.855]  Hi, Alex.
[00:52:36.175 --> 00:52:36.596]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:52:37.736 --> 00:52:39.437]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[00:52:39.497 --> 00:52:41.098]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[00:52:41.879 --> 00:52:44.840]  And I just wanted to say thank you for all you do and God bless you.
[00:52:45.041 --> 00:52:45.341]  Thank you.
[00:52:45.361 --> 00:52:47.142]  Just a few quick points here.
[00:52:48.423 --> 00:52:51.985]  The big picture of the New World Order, I think this is really important.
[00:52:52.005 --> 00:52:57.428]  So one of my ideas was if you could speak about it maybe like at the beginning of each of your segments just a little bit.
[00:52:58.095 --> 00:53:02.917]  Not every segment, but definitely for the show, because I think a lot of people just get overwhelmed.
[00:53:03.657 --> 00:53:06.838]  And they're not exactly sure how all this stuff fits together.
[00:53:08.158 --> 00:53:09.499]  So you do break it down, though.
[00:53:10.139 --> 00:53:11.460]  And I think just doing it more often.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.981]  Also, methodology.
[00:53:15.161 --> 00:53:21.623]  You know, what the goal was to do is they basically, like you were talking about at different points in your show, they create problems.
[00:53:22.521 --> 00:53:31.269]  Um, they use those as a cover, an opportunity to offer a solution, but that's really like a weapon disguised as a solution that furthers their agenda.
[00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:32.571]  And you could break that down too.
[00:53:33.632 --> 00:53:47.625]  And also, um, I was thinking it'd be a good idea to have like, you know, more of like sort of like, um, almost came up with this idea of a pre-market initiative.
[00:53:48.243 --> 00:54:01.352]  Maybe bringing people on from other governments who are committed to having their economies operate in a free market economy and how that plays into the whole opposition of the new world order system, how they're competing against the free market economy.
[00:54:01.372 --> 00:54:01.692]  I agree.
[00:54:01.732 --> 00:54:07.696]  We should be talking more about a true free market system to counter the crony capitalist centralized system.
[00:54:07.736 --> 00:54:08.477]  I appreciate your call.
[00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:21.373]  And yes, we should do more mini-documentaries, five, ten minutes long, like Prager University does, on big subjects that give people a larger understanding of how the world works.
[00:54:22.293 --> 00:54:23.833]  But, I mean, you go read what the globalists say.
[00:54:23.873 --> 00:54:38.257]  They want a new planetary system based on carbon taxes and the surveillance of carbon taxes and a world court, a world army, a system that centralizes control over medicine, over travel, over investment, over education.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:44.682]  Over religion, over reproduction, and that's all being standardized right now.
[00:54:45.943 --> 00:54:57.867]  And so it's a private corporate world government whose endgame is depopulation of the planet and the establishment will then merge with machines and become this new evolved creature.
[00:54:58.388 --> 00:55:01.449]  Now whether they're going to get away with that or whether that's going to work, I don't know.
[00:55:02.483 --> 00:55:08.905]  The Bible says they're going to try to do it and it's going to fail and destroy most of the earth, which they say happened with Atlantis before.
[00:55:09.465 --> 00:55:10.785]  So things, I guess, repeat themselves.
[00:55:13.006 --> 00:55:16.527]  All I know is these people are diabolical and they're super ruthless.
[00:55:17.087 --> 00:55:20.068]  And yeah, they say, oh, we're going to lock things down to stop COVID.
[00:55:20.388 --> 00:55:21.508]  Notice they only lock it down more.
[00:55:21.528 --> 00:55:22.308]  It doesn't stop COVID.
[00:55:23.268 --> 00:55:24.329]  And it gives them more power.
[00:55:24.389 --> 00:55:24.989]  They get richer.
[00:55:25.009 --> 00:55:25.969]  They consolidate control.
[00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:26.509]  You get poor.
[00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:29.430]  Every time they try to help you, it's the opposite.
[00:55:30.776 --> 00:55:33.998]  They throw you a life raft when you're in the ocean, you grab it, it's electrified.
[00:55:35.859 --> 00:55:37.721]  They give you a glass of wine, it's got poison in it.
[00:55:38.461 --> 00:55:40.243]  They give you a cell phone, it tracks and controls you.
[00:55:40.663 --> 00:55:44.225]  I mean, they are committed to evil as much as we're committed to good.
[00:55:44.626 --> 00:55:45.446]  They are purist.
[00:55:46.427 --> 00:55:48.628]  And they see you as idiots and have no respect for you.
[00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:52.631]  Let's go to Joey in North Carolina for a minute and a half.
[00:55:52.651 --> 00:55:53.131]  Joey, thanks.
[00:55:53.151 --> 00:55:56.153]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[00:55:56.254 --> 00:55:56.834]  I sure can, go ahead.
[00:55:57.731 --> 00:55:59.272]  Hey, buddy, I was just wanting to call you.
[00:55:59.292 --> 00:56:04.953]  I was asking about, you know, what we think is going to happen with the new year and everything that's coming.
[00:56:05.774 --> 00:56:13.656]  Honestly, man, I'm just scared to death because why in the world would our government give the vaccine unknowingly?
[00:56:13.696 --> 00:56:14.577]  What's going to happen?
[00:56:14.877 --> 00:56:18.398]  Give it to our first responders and our armed forces first.
[00:56:18.962 --> 00:56:20.744]  I mean, is this just not stupid?
[00:56:20.784 --> 00:56:21.565]  I just don't get it.
[00:56:21.685 --> 00:56:23.347]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:56:23.367 --> 00:56:29.894]  I mean, what's going to happen here in the next year whenever all of our nurses and our doctors start dying?
[00:56:30.494 --> 00:56:31.896]  Who's going to be able to take care of us then?
[00:56:33.228 --> 00:56:35.449]  Well, they think the public's so dumb.
[00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:37.871]  See, they did a test with autism.
[00:56:37.911 --> 00:56:41.213]  We went from 1 in 35,000 boys having autism to about 1 in 58.
[00:56:41.653 --> 00:56:43.755]  It's even worse in South Korea.
[00:56:43.775 --> 00:56:44.595]  It's like 1 in 30.
[00:56:45.296 --> 00:56:52.000]  And so, if we put up with tens of millions of brain-damaged kids and we know it's the vaccines, we're just going to have tens of millions dying of cancer and autoimmune disorder.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.781]  And they'll just, oh, we don't know what it is.
[00:56:53.841 --> 00:56:55.342]  A COVID 2.0 does it.
[00:56:55.763 --> 00:56:57.163]  And they'll just give you some cover story.
[00:56:58.514 --> 00:56:59.154]  You're absolutely right.
[00:56:59.194 --> 00:57:03.215]  This is a soft kill weapon designed to debilitate and bankrupt the country.
[00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:04.595]  This is the war.
[00:57:04.675 --> 00:57:07.876]  We're under World War III attack by the Globalists and by the Chi-Coms.
[00:57:07.916 --> 00:57:08.956]  This is an act of war.
[00:57:09.237 --> 00:57:10.017]  Great point, Joey.
[00:57:10.237 --> 00:57:10.737]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:10.757 --> 00:57:11.177]  Stay with us.
[00:57:11.677 --> 00:57:13.317]  I will see you in the year 2021.
[00:57:13.558 --> 00:57:20.099]  And the mad scientist jumped in the time machine and a bolt of blue light was gone.
[00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:22.720]  There I was, stuck back in the year 1974.
[00:57:28.513 --> 00:57:33.095]  But now, we are entering the year 2021.
[00:57:33.235 --> 00:57:35.356]  Where are the silver jetpacks?
[00:57:35.436 --> 00:57:36.517]  Where are the spaceships?
[00:57:37.538 --> 00:57:44.661]  Sorry, it's nanotech, it's GMOs, it's 5G, it's world government, it's new world order!
[00:57:46.902 --> 00:57:48.443]  That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:49.023 --> 00:57:51.965]  And that's where all of this has gone.
[00:57:53.105 --> 00:57:56.227]  We're taking your phone calls right now, and let's do it!
[00:57:57.486 --> 00:57:59.989]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Charles.
[00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:02.772]  Charles in Georgia, come on down.
[00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:03.413]  Good to have you here.
[00:58:04.754 --> 00:58:06.396]  Hey Alex, man, glad to get a hold of you.
[00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:07.857]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for two months.
[00:58:09.659 --> 00:58:16.547]  There's something really big that went down in that Bob Alinsky interview with Tucker that kind of slipped through the cracks and nobody's paying attention to it.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:32.855]  Do you remember the text message that Giuliani released where Hunter was complaining that, you know, I'm the one who's been earning for the entire family for 30 years, it's really hard, but don't worry, unlike Pop, I won't make you give me half my salary.
[00:58:32.875 --> 00:58:34.256]  Remember that text?
[00:58:35.017 --> 00:58:35.678]  Yes, I remember.
[00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:47.820]  Okay, then there was another email when Bob Alinsky was on, and it showed 10% for this guy, 10% for the other guy, 10% for Hunter, and then in parentheses it said another 10% for Joe.
[00:58:49.582 --> 00:58:51.604]  Hunter's holding another 10% for the big man.
[00:58:52.124 --> 00:58:54.206]  So 10 points for him, 10 points for Joe.
[00:58:54.607 --> 00:58:58.210]  So it's established that the business model, it's very clear, it's a 50-50 split.
[00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:02.374]  Whatever Hunter gets, he splits half with Joe.
[00:59:03.115 --> 00:59:11.623]  Then you look on the screen and they kept showing part of a document, Tucker kept showing, and it had an LLC in there for Hunter and another LLC in there for Jim.
[00:59:12.323 --> 00:59:16.247]  That document, with those little boxes in it, that's what's called a fee agreement.
[00:59:16.787 --> 00:59:17.648]  It's really obvious.
[00:59:17.968 --> 00:59:20.991]  It's obvious why they're only showing part of it too, but that's a separate subject.
[00:59:21.331 --> 00:59:23.373]  The point is, that tells you the structure.
[00:59:23.813 --> 00:59:29.999]  That means whoever's paying Hunter, okay, whether it's coming from China, Ukraine, Romania, wherever it's coming from,
[00:59:31.036 --> 00:59:33.499]  They're sending the money over to what's called a paymaster.
[00:59:33.959 --> 00:59:36.401]  That's why they have that document with the little boxes on it.
[00:59:36.461 --> 00:59:37.542]  That's called a fee agreement.
[00:59:37.943 --> 00:59:41.046]  Everybody that's getting paid on the deal signs off on the fee agreement.
[00:59:41.346 --> 00:59:49.334]  The money comes from China, Romania, whoever's paying the commissions, goes over to the paymaster, and the paymaster disperses the funds based on what's in those boxes that they all agreed to.
[00:59:50.225 --> 00:59:58.455]  So we know that the money goes through the Paymaster, over to Hunter's LLC, and then from Hunter's LLC, he has to split 50% with Joe.
[00:59:58.976 --> 01:00:00.778]  So that's all Trump needs to know right there.
[01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:16.740]  Okay, wherever that money goes out a hundred... Yes, that's the foreign money, and then we have his rat son saying, I meet with the head of Chinese intelligence and the agent I work with has disappeared, and there are billions of my daddy, I'm being investigated by the Southern District, Mommy!
[01:00:17.161 --> 01:00:20.803]  I mean, it's cut and dry that he's a communist Chinese agent.
[01:00:21.003 --> 01:00:22.204]  That's just one piece of it.
[01:00:22.604 --> 01:00:27.908]  Joe goes on TV in China and says, China should run every aspect of our lives.
[01:00:29.946 --> 01:00:31.207]  This is national security.
[01:00:31.547 --> 01:00:34.710]  Trump doesn't need to go through attorneys and warrants and all this.
[01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:39.834]  He can instruct the Treasury and the Fed to follow that money out of Hunter's LLC accounts or wherever it went.
[01:00:39.854 --> 01:00:40.254]  Exactly.
[01:00:40.274 --> 01:00:49.842]  He doesn't need the Justice Department because he's the executive branch and just like he can put sanctions on Iran, he can put sanctions on those countries and on the Bidens.
[01:00:51.087 --> 01:00:58.992]  We can instruct the Treasury and the Fed to find those bribe money accounts in about five minutes today and expose it and say, look, here's all Joe's bribe money accounts.
[01:00:59.032 --> 01:01:00.433]  He can find it in five minutes.
[01:01:01.013 --> 01:01:01.473]  That's right.
[01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.194]  We show his Swiss bank accounts.
[01:01:03.234 --> 01:01:06.576]  Brother, what's crazy is the White House knows this.
[01:01:06.656 --> 01:01:13.620]  I got asked by one of the Trump sons about a week into the election when I went out in Arizona, they said, I want you to talk to this guy.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:18.984]  This guy calls up and he works for a big company and he says, we want you to look into where they get the money.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:20.461]  I don't
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:50.448]  And it was even like the federal government sent part of it, and then a local government, they made a local government make the other part of the 400 million.
[01:01:50.728 --> 01:01:53.531]  I mean, it says the Chinese government, brother!
[01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:55.934]  The Chinese government!
[01:01:56.154 --> 01:02:00.298]  And then it took a week, that ended up being in probably 20 newspapers, but got no traction.
[01:02:00.679 --> 01:02:04.502]  So yeah, so it's not that the White House doesn't know, I guess...
[01:02:06.118 --> 01:02:10.080]  If they've got classified info, the President can declassify it wherever he wants.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.722]  I don't get why they called me to look into it, and I wasn't the only one they were calling.
[01:02:14.782 --> 01:02:16.363]  So, what does that sound like to you?
[01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:19.667]  Well, I don't know why they're not doing it.
[01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:28.209]  I guess that the powers that be already have Joe's bribe money accounts, and they're going to walk in on day one if he gets in and go, hey Joe, we know about all the accounts.
[01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:34.070]  You can keep the money, you can keep the accounts, but on the other hand, here's this green new deal.
[01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:36.710]  Sign off on this, and we won't say anything about it.
[01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:37.550]  Well, that's it, exactly.
[01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:42.211]  Joe, they want him in there because he is the most compromised, slam dunk, easy to destroy.
[01:02:42.231 --> 01:02:45.752]  Remember the remake of the excellent book, stupid movie, Dune?
[01:02:46.592 --> 01:02:49.835]  I mean, I like the director that made Doom, but I don't think it's one of his better films.
[01:02:49.855 --> 01:02:51.196]  But remember Baron Harkin?
[01:02:51.216 --> 01:02:56.059]  It has a heart plug in everybody, where you just pull the plug and it opens up their heart, their aorta.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.361]  I mean, that's what Joe Biden's like.
[01:02:58.401 --> 01:03:01.624]  He literally is on a very short electrified leash.
[01:03:02.164 --> 01:03:08.429]  And I cannot believe that we're about to let this totally compromised creature in control of the United States.
[01:03:09.738 --> 01:03:10.719]  Just expose the accounts.
[01:03:10.919 --> 01:03:11.680]  Just show the whole world.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.602]  Hey, we found all Joe's bribe money accounts.
[01:03:14.622 --> 01:03:15.723]  You're gonna let him get in office?
[01:03:15.963 --> 01:03:16.723]  That'll be the end of him.
[01:03:16.743 --> 01:03:17.604]  They'll have to indict him.
[01:03:18.245 --> 01:03:23.048]  Instead of letting him get in and be told what to do, holding the accounts over his head, just show him now.
[01:03:23.729 --> 01:03:24.750]  Here's his bribe money accounts.
[01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:25.630]  Charles, amazing points.
[01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:26.491]  You're absolutely right.
[01:03:26.571 --> 01:03:27.332]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:03:27.352 --> 01:03:28.032]  I remember seeing that.
[01:03:28.092 --> 01:03:28.513]  Thank you.
[01:03:28.613 --> 01:03:29.453]  Let's take another call.
[01:03:29.553 --> 01:03:30.394]  Danny in Canada.
[01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:31.295]  Danny, thanks for holding.
[01:03:32.416 --> 01:03:33.497]  Hey Alex, great to be here.
[01:03:33.517 --> 01:03:33.937]  How are you?
[01:03:37.051 --> 01:03:39.173]  Yes, calling up from Toronto, Canada.
[01:03:39.193 --> 01:03:42.735]  I'm concerned about what's going to happen on January 6th.
[01:03:43.496 --> 01:03:45.157]  I mean, this is the Great Reset.
[01:03:45.177 --> 01:03:54.143]  I mean, Trudeau up here, my jaw dropped to the floor when Justin Trudeau made that video, looking into the camera, saying, ah, building back better.
[01:03:54.603 --> 01:03:57.665]  This UN slogan that all these leaders are using now.
[01:03:57.765 --> 01:04:00.447]  And he goes, Agenda 2030, the Great Reset is here.
[01:04:00.467 --> 01:04:00.987]  It's here.
[01:04:02.228 --> 01:04:02.669]  It's here!
[01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:06.613]  You're not essential, you're gonna own nothing, you're gonna have nothing, and you're gonna love it!
[01:04:06.653 --> 01:04:07.233]  That's a quote!
[01:04:07.514 --> 01:04:10.157]  You will own nothing, you will have nothing, you will love it!
[01:04:10.197 --> 01:04:11.358]  It's so liberal!
[01:04:12.199 --> 01:04:16.083]  And Klaus Schwab is on TV saying this, and I try to show my friends and family, and they're like...
[01:04:16.437 --> 01:04:20.060]  You know, nobody wants to learn or really listen to what they're saying.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.183]  Well, let them know when they're bankrupt that, you know, who did it to them?
[01:04:23.203 --> 01:04:26.966]  Just let them know because all the being candy asses is over.
[01:04:26.986 --> 01:04:31.630]  This is their big, but they all have these little pretty boy, like little soft voices.
[01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:33.212]  Oh, we're coming to help you.
[01:04:33.532 --> 01:04:34.453]  It's for the COVID.
[01:04:34.713 --> 01:04:40.238]  Meanwhile, they've all doubled their profits last year and are just raping everyone and run giant UN child kidnapping rings.
[01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:42.271]  You're right.
[01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:46.718]  And he's sitting there in a room full of women saying, you know who I admire?
[01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:51.585]  The Chinese communists, the way they can turn their economy around on a dime.
[01:04:51.946 --> 01:04:54.470]  I can't believe he's just so blatant, you know?
[01:04:56.342 --> 01:04:57.303]  Oh, I forgot what he said.
[01:04:57.343 --> 01:04:58.724]  They said, what type of government do you like?
[01:04:58.744 --> 01:05:00.025]  He goes, I like dictatorships.
[01:05:00.045 --> 01:05:00.685]  I like China.
[01:05:00.865 --> 01:05:02.026]  They got the best dictatorship.
[01:05:02.226 --> 01:05:03.087]  And the women all get excited.
[01:05:03.247 --> 01:05:03.847]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:04.308 --> 01:05:05.268]  Oh, he's so cute.
[01:05:05.548 --> 01:05:06.509]  Trudeau's so handsome.
[01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:08.050]  He loves concentration camps.
[01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:11.292]  And this is the sick weirdness.
[01:05:11.733 --> 01:05:14.314]  As people are losing their souls right now, they're becoming very evil.
[01:05:15.615 --> 01:05:23.821]  I mean, I will say one positive thing from this wild year, if you'll let me just say, what I think the best song of the year was by an artist named Sentinel, the Qaikom Dragon.
[01:05:24.631 --> 01:05:30.634]  I don't know if he's going to be putting out an album, but you sang a hilarious song just a couple months ago now.
[01:05:31.015 --> 01:05:38.679]  All right, you know, Fentanyl should make a return.
[01:05:38.699 --> 01:05:41.921]  In fact, 2021, you've got a promise.
[01:05:42.101 --> 01:05:44.882]  Fentanyl will return to the airwaves.
[01:05:45.003 --> 01:05:45.343]  All right.
[01:05:45.383 --> 01:05:45.783]  Thank you.
[01:05:46.163 --> 01:05:47.244]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:05:47.264 --> 01:05:47.744]  Stay with us.
[01:05:48.124 --> 01:05:50.326]  Can you believe we're about to be in the year 2021?
[01:05:53.635 --> 01:05:58.137]  We are not in Kansas anymore, as they say, 877-789-2539.
[01:05:59.037 --> 01:06:02.679]  I want to get to every caller on the board by the time this next hour ends.
[01:06:02.719 --> 01:06:04.280]  We'll continue with calls on or the next.
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.221]  I want to end the year taking your calls.
[01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:16.525]  I'm going to be up here tonight doing several interviews, and I think I might twist some arms and maybe do a special live show as the new year comes in on the East Coast.
[01:06:16.585 --> 01:06:21.007]  We'll see if I can get the volunteers with our great skeleton crew here tonight.
[01:06:21.974 --> 01:06:27.582]  But we are live at 12 noon and 34 minutes Central Standard Time right now.
[01:06:27.602 --> 01:06:34.893]  I want to go to Steve, Rick, Brandon, Damon, Anthony, John, Charles, Ron, and Lena before this hour ends.
[01:06:34.953 --> 01:06:35.454]  But first...
[01:06:37.796 --> 01:06:43.159]  My Patriot Supply has been around 14 years, and they've become the largest storable food company in the U.S.
[01:06:43.179 --> 01:06:50.963]  for the last three, because of their quality, because of their service, because of their good packaging, and because of their low prices.
[01:06:51.664 --> 01:06:53.204]  Everybody else has gone up in prices.
[01:06:53.305 --> 01:06:54.945]  Most people fly by night, unfortunately.
[01:06:54.985 --> 01:06:57.887]  They don't have big amounts of food on hand, or it's not fresh.
[01:06:58.107 --> 01:07:01.649]  There are some other good outlets out there, but they charge you about twice what My Patriot does.
[01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:04.851]  My Patriot has to go up.
[01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:11.116]  On their prices, January 1st, for all their vendors and for everybody else.
[01:07:11.316 --> 01:07:16.357]  And when you buy it at infowarestore.com, you'll still get whatever the best price is, but it's gonna have to go up.
[01:07:17.197 --> 01:07:18.017]  I twisted their arm.
[01:07:19.438 --> 01:07:20.818]  They'd done a sale two weeks ago.
[01:07:20.918 --> 01:07:21.698]  I never promoted it.
[01:07:21.818 --> 01:07:22.558]  I never pushed it.
[01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:23.678]  It didn't do well.
[01:07:24.819 --> 01:07:31.020]  Because I didn't really talk about preparewithalex.com, where they had the last time you could get 2020 prices plus a discount.
[01:07:32.296 --> 01:07:38.341]  And they called me a few days ago and said, hey, we're seeing record sales right now as people figure out that things are serious.
[01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:39.622]  The Great Reset is here.
[01:07:40.842 --> 01:07:42.244]  The globalists want to make people dependent.
[01:07:42.424 --> 01:07:44.265]  Folks want insurance they can eat for 25 years.
[01:07:44.305 --> 01:07:45.646]  We're seeing really high sales.
[01:07:45.686 --> 01:07:48.488]  Have you noticed you're seeing high sales on your own website?
[01:07:48.628 --> 01:07:52.791]  Not at the sales site, preparewithalex.com, where you get that additional savings.
[01:07:53.012 --> 01:07:56.774]  We were having already big sales at the regular price at m4store.com.
[01:07:56.814 --> 01:07:57.715]  I said, yeah, I noticed that.
[01:07:58.075 --> 01:08:00.998]  They said, well, we have the food on hand.
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:05.101]  And we're ready to ship it out within a day or so, depending on what the order is.
[01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:07.961]  Some stuff's specialty foods, they've got a package right there at the time.
[01:08:08.322 --> 01:08:09.862]  But most of it's pre-packed, ready to go.
[01:08:11.402 --> 01:08:14.783]  And they said, you know, do you want us to extend that sale a few days?
[01:08:14.803 --> 01:08:19.064]  And I said, yeah, do it until the 8th of January, and then that's it.
[01:08:20.084 --> 01:08:22.785]  So they hadn't done a sale in years until earlier this year, they've done three of them.
[01:08:23.825 --> 01:08:26.866]  This is their last sale, it's the last time to get the lower prices.
[01:08:28.243 --> 01:08:32.326]  2020 prices and the sale, save up to $850, depending on what food package you get.
[01:08:34.587 --> 01:08:53.440]  You've got eight days, 14 hours, 22 minutes, 33 seconds to get your order in on one week, one month, three months, six months, one year, specialty foods, water filters, air filters, there's all big savings at preparewithalex.com.
[01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:55.462]  Preparewithalex.com.
[01:08:58.697 --> 01:09:01.219]  And then finally, we have a bunch of products back in.
[01:09:01.299 --> 01:09:03.961]  We've got pollen blocks sold out for eight months because of the lockdown.
[01:09:04.021 --> 01:09:04.981]  The economy couldn't get it.
[01:09:05.502 --> 01:09:06.282]  It's back in stock.
[01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:08.004]  France has been totally shut down.
[01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:12.567]  That's where the special quail eggs that make it come from that target the natural antihistamine in it.
[01:09:14.363 --> 01:09:17.024]  We've got X2, the good halogen, sold out for months back in stock.
[01:09:17.825 --> 01:09:20.486]  We've got Super Mel Vitality, sold out for months back in stock.
[01:09:20.986 --> 01:09:26.348]  And of course, we've got Living Defense, the great next-level probiotic to flush out your guts and make them healthy that people love.
[01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:30.450]  Five-star reviews, that's back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:34.472]  And Winter Sun is yet again, vitamin D3, selling out very, very quickly.
[01:09:34.912 --> 01:09:36.073]  All right, I'm done plugging!
[01:09:37.133 --> 01:09:41.015]  Probably for the day, but right now, let's just rampage through your calls.
[01:09:41.415 --> 01:09:43.016]  Rick in Massachusetts, you're on the air.
[01:09:45.342 --> 01:09:54.827]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to let you know I really believe this is part of a much bigger agenda as far as militarily.
[01:09:56.548 --> 01:10:13.796]  I believe that basically if Biden is installed and they were able to push off the rollout of the vaccine, I believe that they would have waited
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:22.943]  If they could, which is why they were trying to push that and say, oh, it's not going to be out in time, to try to give it to our military first.
[01:10:24.123 --> 01:10:28.724]  I believe that they're giving it to the old people so they can hold it from showing.
[01:10:30.505 --> 01:10:33.686]  Because if Trump sees it's afflicting our military, I believe he'd stop it.
[01:10:34.566 --> 01:10:35.747]  So that's a great point.
[01:10:35.787 --> 01:10:38.448]  They've always given experimental vaccines to the military first and then
[01:10:41.058 --> 01:10:41.478]  I have one.
[01:10:41.558 --> 01:10:42.879]  I have a friend that died.
[01:10:42.899 --> 01:10:43.680]  She came back from Iraq.
[01:11:09.972 --> 01:11:10.052]  And
[01:11:25.783 --> 01:11:28.965]  I agree, that's what this is.
[01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:33.807]  This is a soft kill, debilitating weapon against our military and our economy.
[01:11:34.047 --> 01:11:35.888]  China, sir, is bragging about this.
[01:11:35.908 --> 01:11:39.470]  They say, quote, America is over, America is dead.
[01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:44.553]  Have you seen their top people on national TV saying that America's over, we'll never reopen?
[01:11:44.793 --> 01:11:48.094]  We control the top of their government, they'll never let them reopen, America's over?
[01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:50.115]  And the money's just flooding into China.
[01:11:50.315 --> 01:11:53.477]  The world is rejoicing, authoritarians are, that we're over.
[01:11:53.717 --> 01:11:55.118]  They are crying in Brazil.
[01:11:55.358 --> 01:11:56.519]  They are crying in Italy.
[01:11:56.759 --> 01:11:58.020]  They hate what's happening.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:58.941]  Russia's on our side.
[01:11:58.981 --> 01:11:59.941]  They hate seeing this happen.
[01:12:00.302 --> 01:12:01.883]  The Chai-coms are taking over.
[01:12:02.063 --> 01:12:02.683]  You're absolutely right.
[01:12:02.723 --> 01:12:03.404]  Isn't it disgusting?
[01:12:04.685 --> 01:12:05.085]  Oh, it is.
[01:12:05.245 --> 01:12:05.925]  Absolutely.
[01:12:05.945 --> 01:12:05.925]  100%.
[01:12:05.985 --> 01:12:13.791]  And at this point, I think that one good thing that we got going for us is I do believe that
[01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:17.152]  Many, many people that couldn't see it before.
[01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:24.876]  I've been trying to tell people about this since back when you did the cremation at Care, over 20 years ago, when I saw that come out.
[01:12:25.336 --> 01:12:27.798]  And everybody's like, oh, it's a crazy conspiracy theorist.
[01:12:28.138 --> 01:12:30.799]  At the end of the day, those people have changed their tune.
[01:12:31.239 --> 01:12:37.222]  My wife is one of my biggest people that was like, no, that's not possible.
[01:12:37.602 --> 01:12:40.704]  And now she's like, oh my God, you're right.
[01:12:41.206 --> 01:12:45.349]  God bless you, but here's the poison lining to the big pretty cloud.
[01:12:45.909 --> 01:12:50.492]  Instead of it being a silver lining of a bad cloud, the lining is what's bad.
[01:12:51.653 --> 01:12:54.514]  When they make a military attack, they know they're going to get opposition.
[01:12:55.415 --> 01:12:56.956]  And so just waking up isn't enough.
[01:12:56.976 --> 01:13:01.058]  I mean, when Hitler attacked people or the communist invaded countries, we mobilized.
[01:13:01.739 --> 01:13:02.720]  But they already knew that would happen.
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:03.400]  They made their move.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.922]  They're making their move and going, oh, you're waking up?
[01:13:06.002 --> 01:13:06.242]  Good.
[01:13:06.262 --> 01:13:08.723]  You won't be awake soon because your ass is going to be dead.
[01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:09.524]  See?
[01:13:11.135 --> 01:13:13.577]  It's not enough to wake up now, you gotta tell folks this is real!
[01:13:14.297 --> 01:13:15.518]  You're gonna be homeless, folks!
[01:13:16.278 --> 01:13:17.479]  America's under attack!
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.261]  Our president won by a giant landslide, they're removing him!
[01:13:23.383 --> 01:13:24.023]  We're in trouble!
[01:13:25.764 --> 01:13:36.091]  But, the good news is, is at least we're in a fight now, and people aren't gonna be able to sit there and sit on the damn sidelines, and I believe in you, and Trump believes in you, that's why he hasn't given up, and it's why I'm not giving up.
[01:13:39.247 --> 01:13:41.848]  Steve in Georgia, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:13:43.188 --> 01:13:50.271]  Hey Alex, real quick I want to talk about with these times where everybody is like trying to stay healthy and not pass along germs.
[01:13:50.751 --> 01:13:57.994]  Problem is all the soap out there is antibacterial soap and that's actually counterintuitive to what you want to do.
[01:13:58.638 --> 01:14:01.760]  You want to stay clean, you want to keep your good bacteria as well as your bad bacteria.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:02.220]  No, that's right.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:02.980]  I'm going to hold you over.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:03.801]  I don't want to cut you short.
[01:14:03.821 --> 01:14:05.001]  In fact, guys, pull up some studies.
[01:14:05.021 --> 01:14:05.342]  Studies.
[01:14:05.802 --> 01:14:07.503]  Hand sanitizers lowered immunity.
[01:14:07.523 --> 01:14:09.204]  Hand sanitizers lower fertility.
[01:14:09.484 --> 01:14:11.084]  Hand sanitizers cause cancer.
[01:14:11.325 --> 01:14:13.025]  Hand sanitizers kill good bacteria.
[01:14:13.306 --> 01:14:18.288]  Good bacteria are your flora buffer so that you can't get sick.
[01:14:18.548 --> 01:14:23.371]  When you take antibiotics, it'll kill stuff, but then knocks out the good bacteria so you have no buffer.
[01:14:23.571 --> 01:14:25.372]  Then you get sick after all the studies show it.
[01:14:25.792 --> 01:14:30.713]  That's what the caller said is 110% d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-dead on.
[01:14:31.113 --> 01:14:35.614]  But they're telling everybody, don't be around germs, don't be involved, and then those people have no immune systems.
[01:14:35.634 --> 01:14:37.055]  We're gonna come back to Steve.
[01:14:38.115 --> 01:14:39.835]  Then we're gonna go to Damon.
[01:14:40.396 --> 01:14:41.796]  And we're gonna go to Charles.
[01:14:42.236 --> 01:14:43.716]  And we're gonna go to Lena.
[01:14:44.096 --> 01:14:53.899]  And everybody else that's holding newswars.com is theinfowars.com backup band, as in it's banned, it's not allowed, band.video.
[01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:55.550]  We'll be right back.
[01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:56.211]  Stay with us.
[01:14:56.611 --> 01:15:00.112]  On the other side of this quick break, please share those links and override the globalists.
[01:15:01.393 --> 01:15:01.873]  Welcome back.
[01:15:01.893 --> 01:15:02.793]  We're going back to your calls.
[01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:06.155]  Look at these headlines from ZeroHedge.com up on InfoWars.com.
[01:15:06.855 --> 01:15:09.836]  Vaccine passports soon mandatory for travel.
[01:15:10.277 --> 01:15:12.658]  Shopping, even movies, says CNN.
[01:15:13.358 --> 01:15:19.480]  A global QR code to buy and sell announced one month ago by Xi Jinping.
[01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:22.522]  Set up by the Rockefeller Foundation 10 years ago.
[01:15:23.513 --> 01:15:25.173]  I remember we told you this 10 months ago.
[01:15:25.193 --> 01:15:28.134]  They went, it's wild conspiracies.
[01:15:28.734 --> 01:15:30.014]  There's no QR code.
[01:15:30.034 --> 01:15:31.415]  There's no global passport.
[01:15:32.575 --> 01:15:33.175]  And here it is.
[01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:41.657]  It's your international certificate of vaccination by the UN consortium backed by Xi Jinping.
[01:15:42.717 --> 01:15:45.177]  And all these app companies getting accredited by it.
[01:15:45.357 --> 01:15:48.078]  Isn't that liberal?
[01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:52.159]  There it is, China's Xi Jinping to push for global QR code.
[01:15:53.052 --> 01:15:56.653]  He may struggle to convince the world why that was back in November.
[01:15:56.693 --> 01:15:57.973]  That was a million years ago.
[01:15:58.033 --> 01:16:00.313]  Just a month and seven days ago.
[01:16:00.733 --> 01:16:01.513]  November 23rd.
[01:16:03.354 --> 01:16:05.514]  But now it's... You're gonna have it.
[01:16:05.634 --> 01:16:06.614]  You're gonna accept it.
[01:16:06.634 --> 01:16:08.075]  You're gonna be a hero when you get it.
[01:16:08.435 --> 01:16:11.415]  Oh, they say it's dozens of new vaccines you'll take a year.
[01:16:11.895 --> 01:16:12.415]  Dozens!
[01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:15.496]  You'll die and you'll get sick and you'll... But it's okay!
[01:16:15.876 --> 01:16:17.036]  Cause Tim Cook's gay.
[01:16:19.197 --> 01:16:21.497]  It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.540]  Liberal, liberal every day.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:30.322]  2019 bill, before COVID even showed up, pushes draconian detention measures, long before COVID in New York.
[01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:31.522]  It's all the same agenda.
[01:16:33.543 --> 01:16:34.503]  Let's go back to your phone call.
[01:16:34.543 --> 01:16:38.204]  Stephen Georgia, you were making a point about the hand sanitizers.
[01:16:38.584 --> 01:16:42.785]  Hand gel, mass use to create new superbugs, scientist warns.
[01:16:43.445 --> 01:16:48.907]  And a bunch of other articles about how it lowers your fertility, sterilizes you, makes you sick, and kills your good bacteria.
[01:16:49.187 --> 01:16:50.087]  Explain that to people.
[01:16:51.212 --> 01:16:57.318]  Well, uh, what happens is it messes up your hormones, um, because of the, um, antibacterial.
[01:16:57.338 --> 01:17:01.301]  You want some good bacteria, uh, on your body that actually heals you.
[01:17:01.902 --> 01:17:07.847]  And, uh, it actually... Yeah, it turns out that the solid parts of our body, something like a third of us is bacteria.
[01:17:08.327 --> 01:17:10.590]  And Bill Gates knows that and studies it, and he loves you, though.
[01:17:11.971 --> 01:17:13.632]  Yeah, you want, you want some Castile soap.
[01:17:13.652 --> 01:17:17.496]  You don't want this 99% of the stuff in the store is antibacterial soap.
[01:17:17.972 --> 01:17:19.573]  Which is counter-intuitive to what you want to do.
[01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:29.438]  You want to get yourself calcium, calcium soap, something that's not an antibacterial, because you want to keep that good bacteria- And here's the good news, the public's waking up that antibacterial soap's just toxic waste.
[01:17:29.718 --> 01:17:34.721]  They're waking up to Bisphenol A, and that's why the globalists are panicking and trying to not let us get away from it.
[01:17:34.961 --> 01:17:35.561]  Do you believe this?
[01:17:37.242 --> 01:17:45.026]  Yeah, I mean, they're trying to hold us down any way they can, and people are, you know, trying to do the right thing by staying clean, but they're actually going backwards.
[01:17:46.423 --> 01:17:49.386]  So, I urge people, you can make your own hand sanitizer.
[01:17:49.506 --> 01:17:58.393]  It's simple with one part rubbing alcohol, one part witch hazel, and then sprinkle in some of those essential oils you probably have at the FOO store.
[01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:01.376]  And you can make your own hand sanitizer.
[01:18:01.656 --> 01:18:02.477]  And guess what, man?
[01:18:02.817 --> 01:18:09.943]  My kid goes to school, and between every class, she has to slather on hand sanitizer before every class.
[01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:18.397]  My niece, who goes to nursery school, before she shows up at nursery school, right when she walks in the door, they have to slather on it.
[01:18:18.417 --> 01:18:22.120]  And it dries their hands, they absorb the alcohol, it hurts their fertility.
[01:18:22.581 --> 01:18:23.502]  It's a carcinogen!
[01:18:24.538 --> 01:18:29.720]  Under California and other law, what's in hand sanitizer is a carcinogen and people need to start fighting it.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:33.122]  It's like something you do for yourself, like a rat.
[01:18:33.262 --> 01:18:34.562]  Oh, let me clean my hands.
[01:18:34.923 --> 01:18:36.363]  It's good to wash your hands some.
[01:18:36.763 --> 01:18:42.446]  When you've been shaking a bunch of hands, whatever, you never know, just because some people might have some bacteria that your body doesn't like.
[01:18:42.986 --> 01:18:47.348]  But with your wife or people you know, we all make each other stronger.
[01:18:47.728 --> 01:18:49.189]  More bacteria is better.
[01:18:49.249 --> 01:18:49.769]  God bless you.
[01:18:51.775 --> 01:18:56.658]  Again, if you have all the vitamins and minerals you need, you basically cannot get communicable diseases.
[01:18:56.958 --> 01:18:58.199]  Viruses can't replicate.
[01:18:58.299 --> 01:19:00.380]  Bacteria can't take over if you're healthy.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:05.183]  I mean, I don't want to have to knock on wood here, but I get sick like every five years.
[01:19:07.544 --> 01:19:08.745]  And it's a cleansing.
[01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:11.166]  But everybody else I know gets sick constantly.
[01:19:11.827 --> 01:19:13.568]  And I just eat garlic like a pig.
[01:19:13.628 --> 01:19:14.748]  I take vitamins and minerals.
[01:19:15.129 --> 01:19:19.031]  And then I still eat ice cream and porterhouse steaks, folks.
[01:19:19.391 --> 01:19:20.151]  I mean, I'm a glutton.
[01:19:20.211 --> 01:19:20.852]  I love food.
[01:19:22.916 --> 01:19:24.298]  There's a rat washing itself.
[01:19:26.039 --> 01:19:26.300]  Rats?
[01:19:27.461 --> 01:19:29.263]  You know, we're genetically very similar to rats.
[01:19:29.283 --> 01:19:32.086]  We're more genetically similar to a rat or a pig than we are to a chimpanzee.
[01:19:33.908 --> 01:19:35.229]  Some weird stuff going on, folks.
[01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:36.791]  Let's take another call.
[01:19:36.811 --> 01:19:39.894]  Let's talk to Lena in California.
[01:19:39.914 --> 01:19:40.474]  Thanks for holding.
[01:19:40.655 --> 01:19:40.935]  Welcome.
[01:19:42.475 --> 01:19:45.816]  Hi Alex, I'm so glad that I was able to make it on your show.
[01:19:45.876 --> 01:19:48.077]  I've tried to call and you guys have a pretty busy line.
[01:19:48.777 --> 01:19:50.298]  There's two questions I have for you.
[01:19:50.718 --> 01:19:54.299]  The first question is in regards to the digital mobile app.
[01:19:54.719 --> 01:20:04.063]  I've been reading two pieces of information, one from your website, InfoWars, and then one from the actual CDD website, the Center of Disease Control.
[01:20:05.181 --> 01:20:11.064]  There's two apps that are in the potential of being developed, Digital Health Pass and then V-Safe.
[01:20:11.245 --> 01:20:14.947]  There's actually an article on CBD about V-Safe.
[01:20:15.427 --> 01:20:20.710]  But these are mobile apps with personal information and QR linking your phone to your vaccination records.
[01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:24.032]  I have a theory that there's going to be two types of people.
[01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:28.014]  There's going to be the type of people that revolt, that do not want to have the app,
[01:20:28.638 --> 01:20:32.260]  And then there's going to be the type of people that get the vaccine and they're going to want to show proof of it.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.521]  So they're going to have the app.
[01:20:34.081 --> 01:20:42.526]  And my question is this for the people that don't want to use their social media or they don't want to use their phones to have that link.
[01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:49.585]  Do you think that there will be a need for the government to make sure that people have paper documents?
[01:20:49.625 --> 01:21:00.272]  Because I kind of have a theory that if people are like, okay, hey, like, I don't want to use my phone, or like, hey, I don't have, I don't have a smartphone, I have a flip phone, or I downgraded my phone because I don't want them tracking me.
[01:21:00.893 --> 01:21:04.135]  Would there be a need for people to carry around paper documents?
[01:21:04.355 --> 01:21:05.335]  Because... Well, absolutely.
[01:21:05.375 --> 01:21:06.236]  Here's what's going to happen.
[01:21:06.256 --> 01:21:07.077]  The globalists have told us.
[01:21:07.745 --> 01:21:13.564]  There's a 10-part series called Megaopolis put out 11 years ago by the UN.
[01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:19.371]  That's shown to kids in Europe in different languages, but we have the English version.
[01:21:19.751 --> 01:21:23.412]  And they say, those that don't accept it will finally be forced into ghettos.
[01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:24.932]  You won't be allowed to live.
[01:21:25.012 --> 01:21:32.354]  Everywhere else will be smart cities, smart streets, corporate everything, malls, businesses, jobs, airplanes.
[01:21:32.834 --> 01:21:38.695]  And then there'll be what they call ghettos and certain rural enclaves where you're forced to live in those.
[01:21:39.815 --> 01:21:40.976]  And so that's their big phase.
[01:21:41.016 --> 01:21:45.597]  And then, of course, they'll finally fly over with drones, spray us with bio-weapons and try to kill us.
[01:21:46.417 --> 01:21:48.738]  But their plan is the Hunger Games.
[01:21:49.258 --> 01:21:54.799]  People see that and they think, oh, that's a woman, you know, talking about the UN.
[01:21:54.859 --> 01:21:56.940]  No, that's actually predictive programming.
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:00.941]  The actual plan the UN wants is a Hunger Games scenario.
[01:22:01.421 --> 01:22:03.482]  I read a UN biological diversity assessment
[01:22:04.608 --> 01:22:31.638]  Report put out in the late 70s that Dr. Michael Kaufman told me about for Endgame, for Endgame 2.0, and in that it says, we're going to bring back regions, we're going to bring back games, like the Olympics, and we're going to bring back a cash system, and people have to live in rural areas and have no technology, or they'll live in these smart cities, highly controlled, and we're going to bring back human sacrifice at these games.
[01:22:32.378 --> 01:22:43.623]  And we're going to have floating fortresses with UN troops, everyone will be disarmed, and the global forces will be delivered by giant airships.
[01:22:44.244 --> 01:22:55.169]  So when you watch the Hunger Games and that happens, they said there'll be no cars allowed, it'll all be maglev trains, and then armored vehicles for the assistance.
[01:22:55.589 --> 01:22:58.030]  So you watch the Hunger Games, that's actually the plan.
[01:22:59.361 --> 01:23:01.924]  Super high technology elite, we live in huts.
[01:23:02.404 --> 01:23:02.864]  You understand?
[01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:13.775]  One of my theories is that the people that don't want to get the vaccine, that aren't going to comply with the mobile app, they're going to need documents to prove either if they've had it or they've not had it.
[01:23:13.835 --> 01:23:15.917]  And it comes down to paper documents.
[01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.458]  People can fake paper documents.
[01:23:17.778 --> 01:23:19.300]  You can't really fake a digital app.
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:21.281]  I mean, here's the deal.
[01:23:21.361 --> 01:23:26.763]  It's all discriminatory to have your medical records and make you take a vaccine that doesn't even protect you, that damages others.
[01:23:26.823 --> 01:23:30.085]  It's all just, who can they trick to do it in phase one?
[01:23:30.645 --> 01:23:34.947]  Then they're going to start cutting off society and forcing those of us that don't comply into the ghettos.
[01:23:35.307 --> 01:23:43.170]  You're going to have to take sensitivity training, you're going to have to take brainwash training, you're going to have to hand your kids over for re-education, or you're going to have to leave their big cities.
[01:23:43.591 --> 01:23:51.274]  That's why they already announced that in Germany and the U.S., all liberal cities starting next year are going to have toll roads to even enter them.
[01:23:51.674 --> 01:23:53.595]  You'll have to have a chip to even come into a city.
[01:23:55.396 --> 01:23:56.476]  Interesting.
[01:23:56.536 --> 01:23:57.416]  Very interesting.
[01:23:57.677 --> 01:24:00.718]  This is a radical revolution against all freedom, ma'am.
[01:24:02.677 --> 01:24:06.639]  My grandpa, he spent 50 years working in a hospital.
[01:24:06.979 --> 01:24:08.519]  We live in L.A., California.
[01:24:08.539 --> 01:24:11.780]  He's seen many, many pandemics.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:20.564]  People are very uneducated about what a pandemic really is, but HIV was a pandemic, and HIV was far deadlier and far worse of a disease than COVID-19.
[01:24:22.222 --> 01:24:35.913]  His response to it is a lot different because with his medical experience he sees a lot of things and what he's told me is that people really aren't dying from COVID, that they're dying from heart disease, diabetes, other underlying conditions.
[01:24:35.973 --> 01:24:39.436]  Yes, we have all doctors, all nurses, everyone, it's all fact.
[01:24:39.716 --> 01:24:41.798]  But you're only allowed to say what the UN says.
[01:24:42.458 --> 01:24:45.359]  And again, they're not even calling this an epidemic, meaning people are dying.
[01:24:45.399 --> 01:24:46.880]  It's a pandemic, meaning it's spreading.
[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:49.641]  We can say everybody's got water in them, so that's a pandemic too.
[01:24:49.921 --> 01:24:50.361]  Exactly.
[01:24:50.681 --> 01:24:59.064]  It's a tracking synthetic virus to make you all guilty, but it doesn't really kill you unless you have vitamin and mineral deficiencies like any other coronavirus.
[01:24:59.324 --> 01:25:05.047]  But everyone is now going to have an autoimmune response to regular coronaviruses from the vaccine, so that's going to cause the mass death.
[01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:05.727]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:06.207 --> 01:25:08.089]  All right, Damon and Charles, I'm going to you right now.
[01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:10.271]  In the next segment, I'll continue with calls.
[01:25:10.291 --> 01:25:14.074]  The last broadcast I'm doing in the official Alex Jones capacity of the year.
[01:25:14.094 --> 01:25:15.335]  The War Room's coming up.
[01:25:15.415 --> 01:25:15.976]  I want Troyer.
[01:25:16.836 --> 01:25:18.858]  And then I'm gonna be back over tonight doing interviews and stuff.
[01:25:18.878 --> 01:25:25.024]  So I'm gonna shoot around midnight Eastern to go live and, you know, say, hey, we're here in 2021.
[01:25:25.264 --> 01:25:26.205]  We'll see what happens.
[01:25:26.225 --> 01:25:29.648]  We'll see if I can muster up some of the some of the crew here.
[01:25:30.909 --> 01:25:31.069]  But
[01:25:32.912 --> 01:25:36.776]  You heard that lady call in about her grandpa that works in a hospital, and he knows what's going on.
[01:25:36.816 --> 01:25:37.817]  Well, of course, everyone knows.
[01:25:38.738 --> 01:25:43.542]  And then if you say anything or do anything, they try to silence you or punish you because they're authoritarians.
[01:25:43.602 --> 01:25:45.564]  We can't take that as being intimidated.
[01:25:45.965 --> 01:25:48.567]  Things get worse not fighting the bullies politically.
[01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:51.950]  And I grew up learning about bullies.
[01:25:52.091 --> 01:25:56.495]  And at a certain point, you just got to roll your sleeves up and beat the living hell out of them.
[01:25:57.881 --> 01:25:58.601]  Or die trying.
[01:25:58.681 --> 01:26:04.362]  And that doesn't mean physically beat the hell out of them, but get in their face, sue them, get aggressive, stand up for yourself.
[01:26:05.422 --> 01:26:07.683]  They're stampeding us into this.
[01:26:07.703 --> 01:26:11.763]  Again, we're taking the calls, the order they're receiving.
[01:26:11.783 --> 01:26:12.784]  We've got like 20 phone lines.
[01:26:12.824 --> 01:26:14.604]  That's why some of you have been holding over an hour.
[01:26:14.884 --> 01:26:16.244]  Charles in Maryland, welcome.
[01:26:18.464 --> 01:26:19.425]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[01:26:19.785 --> 01:26:22.425]  It is a good day considering the circumstances.
[01:26:22.465 --> 01:26:25.466]  Very happy to get you on the line right now.
[01:26:30.012 --> 01:26:38.434]  I have been fighting all year, Alex, ever since the shutdowns, protesting them with the very few people that were out weekly in Annapolis, Maryland.
[01:26:39.074 --> 01:26:42.995]  Because I predicted what was going to happen with the field with the election there.
[01:26:43.015 --> 01:26:44.735]  Ben, I'm sure you did as well.
[01:26:45.535 --> 01:26:46.235]  And it happened.
[01:26:46.515 --> 01:26:47.195]  And here we are.
[01:26:47.655 --> 01:26:52.876]  Here we are just less than three weeks from the inauguration.
[01:26:53.856 --> 01:26:56.537]  And I wanted to let you know.
[01:26:57.942 --> 01:27:04.727]  Something very special happened to me this year, and it is a direct result of you and your show, Alex.
[01:27:05.468 --> 01:27:07.770]  I didn't know Infowars was still on the air.
[01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:13.734]  I remember watching you about three years ago and listening to you talk about everything that's unfolding and agreeing with you.
[01:27:14.195 --> 01:27:17.597]  I saw you pop up on Facebook and YouTube, and then you got censored.
[01:27:18.498 --> 01:27:22.481]  And by the grace of God, you came back to me shortly before the election.
[01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:25.103]  I pretty much had Tucker Carlson up until that point.
[01:27:27.859 --> 01:27:30.344]  You led me to Christ again.
[01:27:30.385 --> 01:27:32.850]  I became re-saved in God.
[01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:34.393]  I became saved when I was young.
[01:27:34.413 --> 01:27:34.533]  I'm 49.
[01:27:35.908 --> 01:27:39.169]  years old now, and the Holy Spirit just entered my body.
[01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:44.330]  It was amazing, and it totally changed me as a person, and I wanted to thank you for that.
[01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:45.530]  That's been an incredible experience.
[01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:50.871]  I want to thank you, brother, because I want to be with you in eternity with God, and this is an energy issue.
[01:27:50.951 --> 01:27:59.813]  It's good and there's evil, and we have to decide what energy we're going with, and it really comes down to that at the end of the day, and God is real, the devil is real, free will is real.
[01:28:00.153 --> 01:28:01.353]  That's why evil exists, and
[01:28:02.233 --> 01:28:03.074]  I'm not a Pharisee.
[01:28:03.655 --> 01:28:10.903]  I don't sit up here and say I'm perfect and I'm the best person, but my heart's with God and I want to be good and I choose God and I ask God for the strength.
[01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:12.584]  And so I'm sorry.
[01:28:12.604 --> 01:28:14.486]  I've always felt the Holy Spirit very strong.
[01:28:14.827 --> 01:28:17.430]  I go in these big churches, I pick up a fake corporate
[01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:19.491]  I can feel it more than ever.
[01:28:19.511 --> 01:28:20.552]  I can feel it right now, Alex.
[01:28:20.592 --> 01:28:21.093]  And you know,
[01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:45.739]  Couple of other things I've done this year.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:50.484]  One of the ways I've been fighting is by making videos, posting them on YouTube and Facebook.
[01:28:50.504 --> 01:28:55.168]  I actually made one that was good enough to get censored on YouTube.
[01:28:55.208 --> 01:28:55.508]  Good job.
[01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:57.650]  Got an email saying, yeah, thanks.
[01:28:57.711 --> 01:29:00.133]  It was actually said it's medical misinformation.
[01:29:01.258 --> 01:29:02.940]  It's six and a half minutes.
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:04.261]  I worked a day on writing it.
[01:29:04.281 --> 01:29:07.123]  You can actually see my video too.
[01:29:07.183 --> 01:29:09.005]  You can have scientists saying it.
[01:29:09.065 --> 01:29:16.491]  You can have tops of hospitals saying the UN's wrong, which has all been proven correct, and Big Tech says the UN's the boss.
[01:29:16.911 --> 01:29:18.172]  See how we're inside world government?
[01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:19.393]  What was the name of the video?
[01:29:20.994 --> 01:29:28.841]  If you go to Truth Teller at Charles Mackes, that's C-H-A-R-L-E-S-M-A-C-K-E-S.
[01:29:28.981 --> 01:29:30.122]  It's on my parlor.
[01:29:30.899 --> 01:29:33.660]  And I was able to upload the video there, anybody can go.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:39.102]  But you know the best way to tell folks how to find something is just tell them the name of the video, and then put parlor.com at the side of it.
[01:29:39.342 --> 01:29:40.382]  What's the name of the video?
[01:29:40.402 --> 01:29:44.023]  It doesn't have a name because I don't have a name on Parlor, I don't think.
[01:29:44.063 --> 01:29:46.104]  It might say Take America Back, I can't recall.
[01:29:46.124 --> 01:29:47.925]  Alright, well you did a great job, keep it up.
[01:29:48.085 --> 01:29:54.087]  Everybody needs to produce their own reality, and I don't mean their own false reality, your own truth, your own justice.
[01:29:54.127 --> 01:29:58.008]  You need to speak it, write it, say it, online, in the third dimension.
[01:29:58.468 --> 01:30:00.369]  Pray to God about it, talk to your neighbors about it.
[01:30:13.064 --> 01:30:14.085]  One last breath.
[01:30:14.105 --> 01:30:15.306]  Mainstream media.
[01:30:15.886 --> 01:30:16.987]  Government cover-ups.
[01:30:17.747 --> 01:30:19.208]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:30:19.468 --> 01:30:20.649]  Well, so does he.
[01:30:21.130 --> 01:30:25.713]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:30:28.615 --> 01:30:30.176]  Better raise your ears.
[01:30:33.278 --> 01:30:34.939]  Lock up your wife and children now!
[01:30:41.485 --> 01:30:42.726]  The horsemen are drawing near.
[01:30:45.007 --> 01:30:46.248]  Let us deeds they ride.
[01:30:46.268 --> 01:30:48.709]  And they're coming to take your life.
[01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:52.491]  Someone asked you right now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:30:52.511 --> 01:30:56.193]  You're not going to roll over, are you?
[01:30:56.213 --> 01:30:58.114]  Because that doesn't protect you.
[01:30:59.815 --> 01:31:01.416]  Choose your fate now.
[01:31:02.556 --> 01:31:03.057]  Yeah!
[01:31:04.597 --> 01:31:05.458]  Take it in your hands.
[01:31:05.678 --> 01:31:07.519]  You've been dying since the day you were born.
[01:31:07.999 --> 01:31:09.180]  You know it's all been planned.
[01:31:10.802 --> 01:31:12.183]  Stop living on your knees!
[01:31:13.984 --> 01:31:14.905]  Fight on your feet!
[01:31:17.487 --> 01:31:18.908]  You know it's all been planned.
[01:31:21.971 --> 01:31:23.592]  A sinner once, a sinner twice.
[01:31:25.553 --> 01:31:27.094]  You need no confessions now.
[01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:31.298]  You got the fight of your life now.
[01:31:35.495 --> 01:31:40.959]  Just like all those children fought for their lives when those doctors chopped them up, you're gonna have to fight now.
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:43.941]  You let the enemy over the wall.
[01:31:44.422 --> 01:31:47.824]  We all let our own species down.
[01:31:48.745 --> 01:31:50.206]  And now we're gonna be punished!
[01:31:53.189 --> 01:32:01.415]  And make no mistake, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Bill Gateses of the world, they will go into the fire as well.
[01:32:03.188 --> 01:32:06.809]  And their destruction will be the most painful and agonizing ever.
[01:32:07.349 --> 01:32:08.610]  They will be judged!
[01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:16.813]  Every man and every woman will be forced to kneel in front of God.
[01:32:19.353 --> 01:32:24.035]  So Bill Gates can play God all day long and
[01:32:25.128 --> 01:32:33.351]  President, pretender elect, Joe Biden can act powerful all day long, but he's a nobody.
[01:32:34.792 --> 01:32:36.132]  And he will be brought low.
[01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:38.253]  He will be broken.
[01:32:40.114 --> 01:32:44.096]  He will beg the Almighty.
[01:32:47.497 --> 01:32:49.678]  And God will tell him the door is closed.
[01:32:50.598 --> 01:32:51.659]  You are damned to hell.
[01:32:55.814 --> 01:32:56.895]  Damn to hell.
[01:32:58.436 --> 01:33:00.298]  But Joe Biden knows he's damn to hell.
[01:33:01.619 --> 01:33:03.140]  He just wants to take you with him.
[01:33:04.681 --> 01:33:17.991]  So thank your lucky stars every day that you're not Joe Biden or Bill Gates or any of these people who are prepared for their own annihilation and are just trying to drag us down with them.
[01:33:18.612 --> 01:33:19.913]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls here.
[01:33:21.434 --> 01:33:23.116]  Who's been holding the longest now?
[01:33:23.617 --> 01:33:25.720]  That would be Damon in the great state of Kentucky.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:26.120]  Go ahead.
[01:33:28.123 --> 01:33:28.523]  Hugs.
[01:33:28.583 --> 01:33:29.605]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:33:29.625 --> 01:33:30.526]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:30.566 --> 01:33:30.926]  Welcome.
[01:33:32.088 --> 01:33:33.069]  Oh, thanks, man.
[01:33:33.089 --> 01:33:35.653]  God bless you guys and your whole crew at InfoWars.
[01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:37.094]  We really appreciate what you all do.
[01:33:37.114 --> 01:33:39.598]  I get to product and support you guys doing everything I can.
[01:33:41.408 --> 01:33:48.971]  I'm the guy that jumped on stage in front of a million people at the end of the Million Mega March, November 14th, and griped out the promoters for kicking you and Roger Stone off the ticket.
[01:33:49.391 --> 01:33:52.712]  There was probably hundreds of people up there chanting, Alex Jones!
[01:33:52.892 --> 01:33:53.632]  Alex Jones!
[01:33:53.652 --> 01:33:54.813]  With me, it was really a rush.
[01:33:56.073 --> 01:34:03.636]  Well, you know, I'm glad you brought that up, because I was thinking about doing this, and I want to try to be Christ-like, even though I'm a trillion times short of that.
[01:34:05.063 --> 01:34:17.352]  That's all just the confusion of all the different groups and organizations and I've now figured out the chain of events of what happened and basically everybody was wrong in that and I acted like an ass, so did other people, but you know what?
[01:34:17.912 --> 01:34:29.141]  They're not going to probably apologize for acting like asses until I do and so I've had a chance in hindsight and because that did become quite a circus I've just now put all the pieces together so later today
[01:34:29.881 --> 01:34:32.362]  When I start the fourth hour, I'm going to talk about that.
[01:34:32.402 --> 01:34:35.864]  It's funny you happen to call in about that, but that was just a tragedy of errors.
[01:34:36.204 --> 01:34:39.326]  Because when you get a half million people out of different events, things get confused.
[01:34:40.186 --> 01:34:44.589]  And then the next time I was there, I was told, hey, go down to the Supreme Court and have an event.
[01:34:45.049 --> 01:34:45.369]  I don't know.
[01:35:00.675 --> 01:35:00.835]  I don't
[01:35:16.261 --> 01:35:22.184]  And I've been told by one group go there, and then the other group was there, and it was groups fighting with each other, and then Millie Weaver's there.
[01:35:22.464 --> 01:35:24.985]  So as soon as I show up, they go, Millie Weaver, come up here!
[01:35:25.005 --> 01:35:31.348]  And they bring Millie Weaver up, and it's all on video that I didn't even know she was there, and it's like, I'm being attacked by Alex Jones, and you know, so...
[01:35:32.168 --> 01:35:33.169]  So I'll take the high road.
[01:35:33.609 --> 01:35:36.392]  I apologize for what happened there and I apologize how that unfolded.
[01:35:37.293 --> 01:35:39.514]  And because I could see how it looked bad for folks.
[01:35:39.895 --> 01:35:44.599]  And I'll have them pull the video that actually shows where we show up and we get ran into.
[01:35:44.639 --> 01:35:45.680]  And I told my guys, stop!
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:47.581]  We don't want to go up there if we're not wanted.
[01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:51.465]  And then they call Millie up because, I guess, oh let's get a woman up here.
[01:35:51.505 --> 01:35:52.606]  He's assaulting a woman now.
[01:35:53.066 --> 01:35:54.327]  I don't think she was part of that.
[01:35:54.387 --> 01:35:55.728]  I don't think the guy was part of that.
[01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:58.571]  I think it was almost like demons or something were doing it.
[01:35:58.951 --> 01:36:01.212]  Because let me tell you, man, weird stuff goes on in D.C.
[01:36:01.252 --> 01:36:01.772]  at these events.
[01:36:02.393 --> 01:36:07.635]  I mean, it is just, wow, there's weird coincidences and really crazy weird stuff goes on.
[01:36:07.655 --> 01:36:10.056]  So I'll be talking about that at the start of the next hour, but go ahead.
[01:36:11.677 --> 01:36:12.597]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:36:12.837 --> 01:36:16.979]  I've been there for it and the Jericho March.
[01:36:17.539 --> 01:36:23.962]  Of course, I talked to you down in Georgia for a little bit, the first day of the Stop the Steal rally down there in Atlanta.
[01:36:25.888 --> 01:36:28.030]  It's a lot of crazy stuff going on.
[01:36:28.050 --> 01:36:43.641]  My group, DC Under Siege, that I talked to you about in front of the Lincoln Memorial the other day after the Jericho march earlier this month, we're hosting the Won't Back Down rally January 2nd in front of Mitch McConnell's local Kentucky home and hopefully on the 5th in front of his DC home.
[01:36:43.661 --> 01:36:44.922]  So you guys are all invited.
[01:36:45.682 --> 01:36:46.563]  We're done with the
[01:36:47.163 --> 01:36:48.985]  Governance outside the Constitution.
[01:36:49.025 --> 01:36:50.547]  We're done with massive spending.
[01:36:50.867 --> 01:36:56.753]  We're done with all these shutdowns from their bioweapon attacks killing us and our businesses and putting hard Americans into poverty.
[01:36:57.974 --> 01:36:59.756]  You know, hard-working Americans into poverty.
[01:36:59.936 --> 01:37:02.919]  We're, you know, we're done with the constant assault on our rights.
[01:37:03.399 --> 01:37:10.887]  We're done with the censorship and not being able to get our candidates into the political sphere because they can't compete with the purpose of special interests and foreign entities.
[01:37:11.542 --> 01:37:18.644]  And they can't overcome the fraudulent voting machines set up that keeps them from being to oust the establishment from their seats for probably the last 15 years.
[01:37:19.225 --> 01:37:25.907]  And the Obama's Lola Lerner IRS scandal that prevents them from legally declaring their candidacy that's never been addressed.
[01:37:26.587 --> 01:37:33.710]  We're sick and tired of them giving everyone around the world a leg up while they squash American citizens, so it's time for us to put some fear into McConnell.
[01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:37.871]  He sets the globalist agenda in the Senate, so
[01:37:38.981 --> 01:37:45.843]  We won't back down a rally, January 2nd, hosted by DC Under Siege in Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday, January 2nd.
[01:37:45.863 --> 01:37:48.503]  Well brother, I'll be watching for that and I appreciate your call.
[01:37:48.603 --> 01:37:49.163]  Absolutely.
[01:37:49.183 --> 01:37:58.586]  And I know you won't be like Andy out there, threatening to kill Evil Turtle, as he's called, but definitely letting him know that his wife's a Chinese Communist agent and we know that he went along with the election fraud.
[01:37:58.826 --> 01:38:00.726]  The good news is Pence is going to be there now.
[01:38:00.746 --> 01:38:01.686]  He was going to be in Israel.
[01:38:02.206 --> 01:38:03.987]  The good news is Senator
[01:38:04.987 --> 01:38:11.110]  Holly is going to try to block all this, so it's on January 5th and 6th.
[01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:13.352]  The 5th is big, the 6th is even more important.
[01:38:14.572 --> 01:38:21.456]  It's raw numbers we need, so people see millions upon millions upon millions of people.
[01:38:21.976 --> 01:38:24.417]  And they control the airspace, or I'd run a helicopter to show you.
[01:38:24.617 --> 01:38:26.478]  They only show that one square full of people.
[01:38:26.899 --> 01:38:27.739]  That's about 200,000.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:32.642]  The one back right after the election,
[01:38:33.923 --> 01:38:44.791]  The first big rally, that thing had, I mean, the streets full, down five, six streets, going three plus miles to the Supreme Court, all the way to Freedom Plaza.
[01:38:44.931 --> 01:38:45.912]  It was crazy.
[01:38:47.413 --> 01:38:49.955]  I mean, the DC police estimated almost a million people.
[01:38:50.595 --> 01:38:52.096]  The media said a couple hundred thousand.
[01:38:52.617 --> 01:38:55.459]  I don't know, but it was absolutely crazy.
[01:38:55.479 --> 01:39:00.622]  All right, we're going to go to break, and I'm going to come back with, Ron's been holding the longest.
[01:39:01.513 --> 01:39:03.534]  And then we will go to everybody else.
[01:39:03.734 --> 01:39:08.937]  We're going to ring in the New Year here, taking phone calls on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:08.997 --> 01:39:17.061]  And I'm just, again, very, very, very, very honored to be here and very, very blessed to be here.
[01:39:17.961 --> 01:39:20.903]  And I just want to see humanity turn the corner.
[01:39:21.643 --> 01:39:22.403]  We've been decadent.
[01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:23.064]  We've been corrupt.
[01:39:23.084 --> 01:39:24.064]  We've gotten away from God.
[01:39:24.104 --> 01:39:25.525]  We're going to go through some hell now.
[01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:29.551]  But that's what gets God's people back in line.
[01:39:30.131 --> 01:39:32.331]  So every time Israel became corrupt, God put them into bondage.
[01:39:32.972 --> 01:39:34.912]  And we are going into very serious bondage.
[01:39:35.412 --> 01:39:37.773]  But this, if you think people are awake now, you wait.
[01:39:37.793 --> 01:39:41.394]  I mean, you're going to have people dying on every street you know of the COVID vaccine.
[01:39:41.474 --> 01:39:42.634]  It's already killing people everywhere.
[01:39:44.014 --> 01:39:45.195]  When they take it, it's killing people.
[01:39:45.235 --> 01:39:46.795]  It's meant to kill you in a couple years.
[01:39:47.435 --> 01:39:49.036]  It takes over every cell in your body.
[01:39:49.176 --> 01:39:49.996]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:39:51.024 --> 01:39:51.244]  Wow.
[01:39:51.464 --> 01:39:52.125]  We'll be right back.
[01:39:52.145 --> 01:39:52.565]  Stay with us.
[01:39:53.385 --> 01:39:55.167]  Imagine someday it'll be the year 2021.
[01:39:55.367 --> 01:39:57.788]  We'll be in the 21st century.
[01:39:58.849 --> 01:40:00.350]  Imagine someday it'll be the year 2021.
[01:40:00.930 --> 01:40:04.572]  The 21st year of the 21st century.
[01:40:05.633 --> 01:40:08.755]  I remember being about four years old and my mom
[01:40:09.994 --> 01:40:12.596]  Was uh, braising a, a, a rump roast.
[01:40:12.636 --> 01:40:13.817]  She made roast about once a week.
[01:40:14.297 --> 01:40:16.679]  Potatoes and carrots, you know, classic thing.
[01:40:16.699 --> 01:40:17.820]  Especially in the winter.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:22.503]  I still remember going, pshhh, pshhh, you know, cooking the, cooking it before she roasted it.
[01:40:24.364 --> 01:40:29.568]  And going, Alex, think you'll be this old in the year 20, 21 in the new century or the year 2020.
[01:40:32.964 --> 01:40:33.284]  Or the year 2000.
[01:40:33.784 --> 01:40:36.085]  And she was just talking about different dates coming up.
[01:40:36.105 --> 01:40:37.906]  The year 2000, the year 2001.
[01:40:37.946 --> 01:40:44.029]  I remember her talking about, you know, it's not really the new millennium until it's 2001.
[01:40:44.089 --> 01:40:46.490]  But some say 2000.
[01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:48.411]  She was like, just imagine the year 2021.
[01:40:48.991 --> 01:40:51.292]  I still remember that.
[01:40:52.993 --> 01:40:55.494]  Like imagining back in the late 1970s.
[01:40:55.554 --> 01:40:56.674]  Oh, the year 2000, the year 2020, 2021.
[01:40:56.734 --> 01:40:57.075]  And here we are.
[01:41:04.238 --> 01:41:04.839]  And guess what?
[01:41:04.939 --> 01:41:07.363]  It's wild science fiction.
[01:41:07.423 --> 01:41:08.304]  World government.
[01:41:08.745 --> 01:41:09.687]  Lockdown of the West.
[01:41:09.747 --> 01:41:11.189]  Communist China taking over.
[01:41:12.210 --> 01:41:13.933]  Inoculations to buy and sell.
[01:41:14.434 --> 01:41:15.415]  They're preparing us for.
[01:41:15.776 --> 01:41:18.460]  And the inoculation takes over our DNA.
[01:41:19.574 --> 01:41:24.818]  And top scientists look at the vaccine and say, this will cause horrible autoimmune responses, or it'll shut your immune system off.
[01:41:25.098 --> 01:41:26.759]  And it's got jellyfish DNA in it.
[01:41:26.779 --> 01:41:30.722]  And it's got the whole cloned genomes of dead children.
[01:41:31.022 --> 01:41:34.684]  And they look at it and go, this won't protect you from COVID.
[01:41:35.225 --> 01:41:39.087]  This will attack protein that's in your body and cause an autoimmune disorder.
[01:41:40.608 --> 01:41:42.529]  And sure enough, people are sick, they're dying.
[01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:44.631]  And they just go, be tough.
[01:41:45.291 --> 01:41:47.393]  We'll never open the economy till you take it.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.702]  And they're just normalizing, killing us.
[01:41:50.742 --> 01:41:51.823]  They had to get to this point.
[01:41:52.203 --> 01:41:53.684]  You always wonder, wonder what it would look like.
[01:41:53.784 --> 01:41:54.325]  Here it is.
[01:41:56.386 --> 01:42:01.110]  That's one reason our credibility's gone supernova is everybody knows I would harp on Bill Gates in my films.
[01:42:01.851 --> 01:42:03.992]  Going back 20 years, they go, why are you obsessed with Bill Gates?
[01:42:04.012 --> 01:42:04.973]  Because I study this stuff.
[01:42:06.274 --> 01:42:08.356]  And Bill Gates is as powerful as they get.
[01:42:08.876 --> 01:42:14.821]  Klaus Schwab headed up the United Nations Operation for Sustainability.
[01:42:14.841 --> 01:42:17.323]  When you hear sustainability, that means mass extermination, world government.
[01:42:20.103 --> 01:42:24.287]  And so, he's like the Mater D at a restaurant.
[01:42:24.387 --> 01:42:26.288]  He's in charge of it.
[01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:36.337]  So when the dinner's incredible, they have a great night, they thank the Mater D, they celebrate the Mater D. He's the chief actual scientist in command of operations.
[01:42:38.139 --> 01:42:39.180]  He's a scientist engineer.
[01:42:40.201 --> 01:42:43.884]  Gates, though, is like the owner of the restaurant.
[01:42:45.407 --> 01:42:57.913]  Because there was, again, more than 50 large robber baron foundations that had gotten together to carry out world government and eugenics, headed up by IBM, that financed Hitler and all the rest of it, the UN.
[01:42:58.894 --> 01:43:01.755]  And he is the officer in charge of that.
[01:43:01.815 --> 01:43:05.117]  He chairs the global eugenics board.
[01:43:05.137 --> 01:43:07.138]  They have awards, they give them awards.
[01:43:08.579 --> 01:43:11.100]  And he's the big daddy.
[01:43:12.759 --> 01:43:18.302]  I'm not saying he's the Antichrist, but like, let's use the Christian allegory of Lord of the Rings.
[01:43:18.902 --> 01:43:19.362]  J.R.R.
[01:43:19.382 --> 01:43:20.423]  Tolkien was a big Christian.
[01:43:20.463 --> 01:43:21.623]  He did this as an allegory.
[01:43:22.584 --> 01:43:25.665]  And so you've got Sauron that's the devil.
[01:43:26.986 --> 01:43:34.670]  Well, technically in that lore, there was another older Satan that got destroyed and then Lucifer was now Sauron.
[01:43:36.211 --> 01:43:38.112]  So he was kind of like the next wave of Satan.
[01:43:38.972 --> 01:43:40.373]  And then under him,
[01:43:41.564 --> 01:43:48.369]  He had the kings of the earth that had sold out their power unto him, and then he gave them power but bound them to him to be living dead.
[01:43:48.829 --> 01:43:50.050]  That shows spiritually who they are.
[01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:52.852]  They physically die, but the spirit in them continues on.
[01:43:53.732 --> 01:43:56.855]  And so Bill Gates is like the king of the Nazgul.
[01:43:58.856 --> 01:44:00.097]  We had to describe Bill Gates.
[01:44:00.157 --> 01:44:01.378]  He's the witch king.
[01:44:03.132 --> 01:44:05.154]  Ruler of the Nazgul, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:05.994 --> 01:44:08.476]  And I mean, I'm serious and I'm dead serious about this.
[01:44:08.516 --> 01:44:12.420]  He will kill you deader than a hammer if he gets away with it.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:17.704]  And then you've got his little goblin minion, Fauci.
[01:44:19.565 --> 01:44:21.207]  These are very serious people.
[01:44:21.769 --> 01:44:25.570]  They're like, the Earth is overpopulated, we don't enjoy what we do, but we have to do it.
[01:44:25.871 --> 01:44:26.851]  But they love it!
[01:44:27.551 --> 01:44:28.292]  They love it!
[01:44:28.572 --> 01:44:30.572]  Hey, Fauci, how about you and Gates go first?
[01:44:30.652 --> 01:44:40.756]  I'd really respect you more, Fauci, if you walked out on TV, with a big, razor-sharp butcher knife, and you went, there's too many of us, and went... You started just jabbing it in your carotids.
[01:44:40.776 --> 01:44:43.578]  I mean, I would respect you.
[01:44:46.561 --> 01:44:56.148]  Or like a samurai have your second help you, like maybe commit seppuku, take a short sword and go into your right side of your liver and pull it right up into your soul.
[01:44:56.328 --> 01:45:01.672]  Then maybe a Bill Gates shoved a 12 gauge shotgun in his mouth and just said, there's too many people.
[01:45:02.293 --> 01:45:03.414]  Blew the top of his brains out.
[01:45:03.894 --> 01:45:05.916]  I'd say, well, yeah, I don't agree with him, but I respect him.
[01:45:07.637 --> 01:45:09.839]  But you don't expect that to happen, Fauci.
[01:45:09.879 --> 01:45:14.222]  You're not going to take ice picks and run them into your eyes, huh?
[01:45:15.243 --> 01:45:15.323]  No.
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:24.063]  You're going to put poison in our kids and give them debilitating disorders that sterilize them, and then weigh down society.
[01:45:24.703 --> 01:45:35.909]  Because you're not even cool enough, like Bertrand Russell, who wanted to drop neutron bombs, theoritized, on all the major cities that he populated the Earth.
[01:45:36.729 --> 01:45:40.391]  At least Bertrand Russell wanted to kill everybody in five minutes, you jerk!
[01:45:44.718 --> 01:45:53.321]  But you're going to kill us real slow and real sweet because you're Dr. Fauci, Dr. Fauci, my name is Fauci.
[01:45:54.041 --> 01:45:57.323]  Oh, don't talk about vitamins and minerals.
[01:45:57.423 --> 01:45:58.363]  Nothing will help you.
[01:45:59.503 --> 01:46:00.504]  They got under major pressure.
[01:46:00.584 --> 01:46:02.504]  Okay, maybe vitamins will help.
[01:46:06.186 --> 01:46:09.307]  So they get to a point where they got to hit us with the weapons.
[01:46:11.247 --> 01:46:12.328]  And we've now reached the point
[01:46:13.558 --> 01:46:22.901]  Well, they're hitting us with the weapons and they have to, again, normalize us getting sick, normalize us being told to shut up, normalize the liability protection.
[01:46:23.662 --> 01:46:24.342]  It's ambient.
[01:46:24.962 --> 01:46:28.763]  Imagine putting a baby in a microwave and you just put it on low at first.
[01:46:28.783 --> 01:46:29.944]  Then you kind of turn it up more.
[01:46:30.544 --> 01:46:31.604]  And see, that's what this is.
[01:46:32.625 --> 01:46:33.485]  The frog in the pot.
[01:46:34.385 --> 01:46:36.306]  Turn it up slow so it's kind of warm and comfortable.
[01:46:36.326 --> 01:46:36.886]  He doesn't get out.
[01:46:37.226 --> 01:46:38.747]  He doesn't feel incrementalism.
[01:46:39.727 --> 01:46:40.968]  Successive approximation.
[01:46:42.022 --> 01:46:42.422]  We're good to go.
[01:47:12.892 --> 01:47:14.233]  Yeah, they really love the Spanish flu.
[01:47:14.253 --> 01:47:17.455]  I went and dug it up out of the North Pole and stuff where whalers died during 1917.
[01:47:17.615 --> 01:47:20.296]  I dug them up like 15 years ago.
[01:47:20.937 --> 01:47:27.661]  Because they're like, why do regular flus not even kill a million people worldwide, but this one killed 50, 60, 70 million, we're not sure.
[01:47:28.181 --> 01:47:30.442]  And they found out it was the autoimmune response.
[01:47:30.802 --> 01:47:41.989]  People that had a flu similar that caused a super reaction, not just an antibody reaction, but a huge anaphylactic shock, you know, just total shutdown, dying.
[01:47:43.666 --> 01:47:44.266]  See how it works?
[01:47:45.307 --> 01:47:49.829]  So that's what, I figured out that one of the deployments, it's got a lot of little special weapons.
[01:47:50.650 --> 01:47:52.050]  See, you don't want everybody dying on one thing.
[01:47:52.131 --> 01:47:52.951]  It's five viruses.
[01:47:53.231 --> 01:47:57.533]  You're gonna die of this, you're gonna die of that, you're gonna die of this, die of that, die of this, die of complications of that.
[01:47:58.094 --> 01:48:01.616]  But they hit you and then causes an autoimmune response to any cold virus.
[01:48:01.976 --> 01:48:05.778]  So watch, everybody that takes this shot will then almost die or die from colds.
[01:48:05.998 --> 01:48:07.399]  The common cold will now kill you.
[01:48:07.619 --> 01:48:08.639]  Thank you, Bill Gates!
[01:48:08.879 --> 01:48:09.440]  Thank you!
[01:48:10.615 --> 01:48:15.158]  And then Owen Schroyer is going to lead a demonstration down at the W tonight, 11 p.m.
[01:48:15.778 --> 01:48:19.301]  The bars, the restaurants, they're saying they're not following the illegal order of the U.N.
[01:48:19.821 --> 01:48:20.862]  globalist mayor.
[01:48:22.183 --> 01:48:29.247]  Peaceful protest New Year's Eve at the W Hotel in Austin, Texas, right off Cesar Chavez First Street, 11 p.m.
[01:48:29.908 --> 01:48:32.809]  Unofficial sponsors Black Lives Matter and Austin Homeless.
[01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:38.033]  That way, they can't say there's a curfew even though he's announcing illegal curfew.
[01:48:39.926 --> 01:48:42.607]  Hell, we're allowed to burn buildings down and kill people, but we're not going to do that.
[01:48:43.087 --> 01:48:47.408]  Just because we're Black Lives Matter, or Antifa, doesn't mean we're going to shoot or kill anybody.
[01:48:47.428 --> 01:48:50.068]  We're going to be totally peaceful, because we're being sarcastic.
[01:48:51.908 --> 01:48:56.009]  We're not sponsored by Black Lives Matter and those guys.
[01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:56.449]  What does it matter?
[01:48:56.469 --> 01:48:58.030]  Because we're not going to be burning anything down.
[01:48:58.810 --> 01:49:01.070]  But the mayor has announced a curfew illegally.
[01:49:01.110 --> 01:49:02.250]  The governor said it's illegal.
[01:49:04.471 --> 01:49:05.431]  So has the Attorney General.
[01:49:06.351 --> 01:49:09.292]  It's big national news, and everybody should just start disregarding this crap.
[01:49:10.086 --> 01:49:15.010]  What you saw in New York, what you saw in other globalist-controlled areas, they're now trying to duplicate across the country.
[01:49:15.871 --> 01:49:18.413]  And now they're saying, oh sorry, the lockdown's never gonna end.
[01:49:18.453 --> 01:49:19.654]  We always knew that was coming.
[01:49:19.674 --> 01:49:21.476]  This is disgusting and it's all a fraud.
[01:49:21.936 --> 01:49:22.997]  The hospitals are empty.
[01:49:23.257 --> 01:49:23.898]  It's all lies.
[01:49:25.709 --> 01:49:27.489]  Some emergency rooms are full of other stuff.
[01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:29.930]  Okay, who's been holding the longest now?
[01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:32.330]  Let's go ahead and go to Ron in Ohio.
[01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:33.171]  Ron, thanks for holding.
[01:49:33.191 --> 01:49:33.491]  Go ahead.
[01:49:33.951 --> 01:49:34.511]  Hey, Alex.
[01:49:34.551 --> 01:49:36.011]  I've been listening to you since 2005.
[01:49:36.531 --> 01:49:41.012]  It's the first time I've ever been able to get in touch with you.
[01:49:41.052 --> 01:49:45.433]  I've just got two quick points and then I'll hang up and wait for your response, please.
[01:49:46.133 --> 01:49:50.594]  I just want to give... I live in Butler County, Ohio, and I want to give prompts out to our sheriff.
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:50:03.484]  Uh, Sheriff Jones, uh, when our wacky, uh, governor started coming out with these crazy edicts back in, uh, April, May, March, April, May, our sheriff basically, uh, said, you know what?
[01:50:03.724 --> 01:50:05.644]  I'm not going to enforce these mask rules.
[01:50:06.185 --> 01:50:10.946]  Uh, you know, he, there was no Antifa riding, anything like that.
[01:50:10.986 --> 01:50:20.209]  So I want to give a shout out to our sheriff because that's, uh, I believe the only thing standing between tyranny, uh, here where I'm at, but, uh, my main,
[01:50:20.708 --> 01:50:27.895]  The point is, I do not understand why Trump is not at the Resolute Desk, like you're saying.
[01:50:28.055 --> 01:50:40.887]  I believe that you're giving him keys to keep people informed, keep people updated, and he's not doing that, and it just infuriates me.
[01:50:41.348 --> 01:50:45.271]  And also, I don't understand why he's not dropping the hammer on the deep state.
[01:50:50.162 --> 01:50:52.323]  He doesn't understand the power of the executive.
[01:50:52.683 --> 01:50:54.144]  He's trying to work for the Justice Department.
[01:50:54.164 --> 01:50:56.965]  It's filled with a bunch of cowardly lawyers at the top.
[01:50:57.005 --> 01:50:59.026]  You know, scum rises to the top there in D.C.
[01:50:59.767 --> 01:51:02.228]  And so he's been waiting for the evidence of fraud to come in.
[01:51:02.268 --> 01:51:03.849]  Now the fraud's evidence has come in.
[01:51:04.409 --> 01:51:07.631]  And he's going to be at the January 6th rally at the Ellipse.
[01:51:08.351 --> 01:51:08.511]  Right.
[01:51:27.370 --> 01:51:28.711]  And I know he was really elected.
[01:51:29.111 --> 01:51:30.872]  People go, well, Trump's done this and that, but it's wrong.
[01:51:30.952 --> 01:51:32.953]  Yeah, red flag laws are terrible.
[01:51:32.973 --> 01:51:34.674]  He at least gave tacit support for that.
[01:51:35.094 --> 01:51:36.735]  Yeah, I don't agree with him going along with the vaccine.
[01:51:36.755 --> 01:51:37.315]  That's terrible.
[01:51:37.675 --> 01:51:38.455]  I get why he did it.
[01:51:38.495 --> 01:51:39.296]  Doesn't mean I support it.
[01:51:39.976 --> 01:51:40.576]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:51:40.677 --> 01:51:41.477]  He got elected.
[01:51:41.537 --> 01:51:43.178]  He's not the globalist CHICOM agent.
[01:51:43.398 --> 01:51:44.658]  He's light years better than Biden.
[01:51:46.564 --> 01:51:51.208]  We have to stand with President Trump because the globalists are never going to take their foot off our neck if we don't.
[01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:52.449]  Thank you so much, Ron.
[01:51:53.010 --> 01:51:57.234]  Everyone who wants Trump to take action, you've got to go to D.C.
[01:51:57.274 --> 01:51:57.754]  by the 5th.
[01:51:58.515 --> 01:52:00.176]  The 5th and the 6th are critical.
[01:52:00.477 --> 01:52:01.798]  We need a million people on the 5th.
[01:52:01.818 --> 01:52:03.339]  We need two million on the 6th.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:06.001]  We need to fill everywhere.
[01:52:06.621 --> 01:52:12.405]  And we need everyone to shoot footage of it on their phones and upload it to Parler, Twitter, Facebook, email it to friends.
[01:52:12.665 --> 01:52:14.046]  Just tape everything yourselves.
[01:52:14.086 --> 01:52:15.227]  Just flood social media.
[01:52:15.247 --> 01:52:16.508]  Just show the world.
[01:52:16.848 --> 01:52:21.351]  And while you're there, get up in the morning and call into C-SPAN.
[01:52:22.192 --> 01:52:23.292]  And call and talk radio.
[01:52:23.452 --> 01:52:24.513]  And tell folks what's going on.
[01:52:24.773 --> 01:52:26.094]  All of you are in the info war.
[01:52:26.334 --> 01:52:27.215]  All of you are critical.
[01:52:28.416 --> 01:52:28.796]  All right?
[01:52:30.319 --> 01:52:31.019]  Who's up now?
[01:52:31.159 --> 01:52:31.799]  Let me see.
[01:52:32.179 --> 01:52:34.860]  That would be Anthony in Oklahoma.
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:35.200]  Go ahead.
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:40.361]  Go back to Anthony in a minute.
[01:52:40.381 --> 01:52:42.441]  He is on the radio, so it's delayed.
[01:52:42.461 --> 01:52:45.742]  Let's go ahead now and go to John in Virginia.
[01:52:45.782 --> 01:52:46.122]  Go ahead.
[01:52:47.362 --> 01:52:48.562]  Hey, Alex.
[01:52:48.642 --> 01:52:49.642]  First-time caller.
[01:52:49.682 --> 01:52:51.343]  I've been watching since high school.
[01:52:51.423 --> 01:52:53.963]  I just wanted to say I thank you for everything you do.
[01:52:54.203 --> 01:52:56.463]  I want to do a quick shout-out to BrainForce.
[01:52:56.563 --> 01:52:59.004]  Quick shout-out to Sigma Chi and Alpha C4eon.
[01:53:00.191 --> 01:53:05.375]  I'm an Appalachian boy, and I really just called you because we're just getting sick and tired of it, man.
[01:53:05.815 --> 01:53:10.918]  I had to go to my girlfriend's Christmas celebration with masks on to stay away from everybody.
[01:53:11.639 --> 01:53:17.223]  And, uh, I really think this area is ready to not have a federal government anymore.
[01:53:17.383 --> 01:53:24.267]  Everyone- I agree, but I mean, I would speak out at that Christmas party and show people the evidence of fraud and how masks cause bacterial pneumonia.
[01:53:25.428 --> 01:53:29.351]  I've tried, man, and just because they think they're nurses, they think they know everything.
[01:53:30.558 --> 01:53:33.481]  Well, you know, most of the nurses say that it's all a fraud to scam.
[01:53:33.821 --> 01:53:35.182]  So these must be really young nurses.
[01:53:36.523 --> 01:53:39.867]  One is her grandma, and one of them's like a 30-year-old woman.
[01:53:39.887 --> 01:53:40.687]  I don't know.
[01:53:40.707 --> 01:53:41.948]  They're both pretty liberal.
[01:53:41.968 --> 01:53:43.170]  They both voted for Biden.
[01:53:43.190 --> 01:53:43.770]  I mean, that's it.
[01:53:43.810 --> 01:53:44.050]  No, no.
[01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:47.494]  They know it's about their power, and they're making everybody wear a burqa.
[01:53:47.874 --> 01:53:52.098]  So these women are no different than an Islamic chieftain who makes his women wear burqas.
[01:53:53.815 --> 01:53:55.976]  No, I completely agree, Alex.
[01:53:56.016 --> 01:53:57.417]  This is COVID Sharia!
[01:53:58.218 --> 01:53:59.379]  COVID Sharia!
[01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:00.940]  Bum bum bum bum bum!
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:02.200]  Bye, COVID!
[01:54:02.821 --> 01:54:03.061]  Sorry.
[01:54:05.803 --> 01:54:07.244]  But I completely agree, man.
[01:54:07.304 --> 01:54:11.266]  I think that what you've done, though, for this country is absolutely a good thing, man.
[01:54:11.706 --> 01:54:20.232]  I think that you are one of the only few people left who's ready to speak what they think, and I think that you just need to keep on doing it, man.
[01:54:20.272 --> 01:54:21.793]  I'm going to be happy to see you on the 6th.
[01:54:22.609 --> 01:54:23.929]  I can't wait for that Trump rally.
[01:54:24.309 --> 01:54:26.850]  I just want to let you know I'm calling to say thank you for everything you've done.
[01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:28.410]  John, we love you and we appreciate you.
[01:54:28.450 --> 01:54:29.011]  God bless you.
[01:54:29.351 --> 01:54:30.491]  And I'm not putting women down.
[01:54:30.731 --> 01:54:35.132]  Some women statistically are as mathematically smart as men.
[01:54:35.332 --> 01:54:37.473]  They are more aggressive than men.
[01:54:37.793 --> 01:54:38.633]  They're more dynamic.
[01:54:39.133 --> 01:54:42.074]  On average, men are more mathematical.
[01:54:42.234 --> 01:54:43.214]  Men are more aggressive.
[01:54:43.614 --> 01:54:44.754]  Men don't bow as much.
[01:54:44.874 --> 01:54:48.715]  Men have been taught to be domesticated slugs, let their wives and girlfriends work for them.
[01:54:49.675 --> 01:54:51.816]  And women have been taught to comply with the system.
[01:54:53.806 --> 01:54:58.729]  And so that's why we're being led into bondage by women, just as the Bible says will happen in the end times.
[01:54:59.750 --> 01:55:00.831]  But that's not women's fault.
[01:55:00.911 --> 01:55:03.773]  That's men's fault for not being leaders.
[01:55:04.333 --> 01:55:06.995]  Some of the most angry people I know about masks are women.
[01:55:08.997 --> 01:55:15.221]  But they're women that are smart and informed and grew up around strong men.
[01:55:16.802 --> 01:55:18.203]  Strong women make strong men.
[01:55:18.323 --> 01:55:19.444]  Strong men make strong women.
[01:55:20.718 --> 01:55:22.979]  And they know how to manipulate women.
[01:55:23.119 --> 01:55:23.900]  Oh, you're a hero.
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:24.540]  Save a life.
[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:25.300]  Be respectful.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:27.021]  And so women are team players.
[01:55:27.101 --> 01:55:29.642]  Well, that works great when you've got a good society.
[01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:30.883]  Women are the bedrock of society.
[01:55:32.023 --> 01:55:33.604]  But it's a social contract that's broken.
[01:55:33.924 --> 01:55:37.266]  And the system wants 90% of college graduates to be women.
[01:55:37.606 --> 01:55:38.726]  That's not to empower women.
[01:55:39.007 --> 01:55:41.748]  They want a compliant, ruling establishment.
[01:55:43.237 --> 01:55:45.418]  And the average feminist controller will tell you this.
[01:55:45.498 --> 01:55:47.739]  They know they're hooked into authoritarianism.
[01:55:48.059 --> 01:55:57.144]  It's been women CEOs, you know, leading the way into censorship and control and giving their sons Ritalin and taking their sons to be sterilized chemically because, oh, he's a girl.
[01:55:58.665 --> 01:55:59.425]  Very, very sick.
[01:56:01.286 --> 01:56:02.647]  And so I'm not a woman hater.
[01:56:02.887 --> 01:56:03.847]  I love women.
[01:56:05.388 --> 01:56:05.588]  But.
[01:56:08.590 --> 01:56:10.591]  Men are apt to tell you, let's just go on to get along.
[01:56:10.771 --> 01:56:12.772]  Women are really apt to do it.
[01:56:14.633 --> 01:56:15.873]  And I'm talking about statistics.
[01:56:16.674 --> 01:56:19.335]  Again, are there long-distance runners that can beat Kenyans?
[01:56:19.495 --> 01:56:20.695]  Yeah.
[01:56:21.335 --> 01:56:23.956]  Are 95% of the international long-distance runners Kenyans?
[01:56:24.497 --> 01:56:25.737]  They beat all the Africans, too.
[01:56:26.257 --> 01:56:38.482]  Because genetically, they are superior at long-distance running because of living generation for generation in very arid, very dry areas where they run dozens of miles a day
[01:56:39.665 --> 01:56:41.706]  And genetically, they do that.
[01:56:41.746 --> 01:56:43.368]  Well, women know how to have babies.
[01:56:43.448 --> 01:56:44.568]  Men can't do that.
[01:56:45.929 --> 01:56:48.391]  And that's why men are all the chess champions.
[01:56:48.411 --> 01:56:53.495]  They have that new Netflix show about the little girl, that's really a story about a little boy, who she's the chess champion.
[01:56:53.675 --> 01:56:54.415]  It's just not true.
[01:56:55.196 --> 01:56:56.557]  But see, it's fantasy land.
[01:56:58.398 --> 01:56:59.158]  It's fantasy land.
[01:56:59.559 --> 01:57:03.361]  And then now, men say they're women and go win all the sports.
[01:57:03.521 --> 01:57:05.623]  And we go, oh, it's a little girl.
[01:57:05.743 --> 01:57:06.383]  No, it's a dude.
[01:57:08.399 --> 01:57:09.380]  With his testicles.
[01:57:10.561 --> 01:57:11.561]  But again, it's a cult.
[01:57:12.342 --> 01:57:17.966]  Accept the mask, accept the checkpoints, accept the COVID-19, accept the world government, accept the New World Order.
[01:57:18.767 --> 01:57:21.849]  And they're just seeing what we will accept.
[01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:27.813]  They're destroying our roles, they're destroying our children, they're sterilizing our boys and making it fashionable and cool.
[01:57:28.053 --> 01:57:30.435]  It's sick and it's satanic and it must end.
[01:57:31.136 --> 01:57:32.136]  More phone calls.
[01:57:33.197 --> 01:57:35.018]  And I'm going half an hour into the next hour.
[01:57:36.001 --> 01:57:38.022]  With Owen Schroyer with some big breaking news.
[01:57:39.724 --> 01:57:43.086]  And then tonight, 11 p.m.
[01:57:43.306 --> 01:57:53.733]  Central, I'll be down at the W on First Street where the degenerate, evil, UN mayor lives, who announced martial law and said, don't come out of your houses at night, unless you're homeless, please defecate everywhere.
[01:57:54.674 --> 01:57:56.335]  This little New World Order rat creature,
[01:57:58.359 --> 01:57:58.559]  Yes.
[01:58:17.932 --> 01:58:18.612]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[01:58:47.475 --> 01:58:50.056]  Hey, God bless you and all have been for worse.
[01:58:51.877 --> 01:59:04.243]  So, what I was really paying attention to most of is that you said, you know, how the Holy Spirit is alive more than ever and it's getting stronger.
[01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:13.848]  Well, you know, I've been thinking about it and, you know, as I see the Holy Spirit blanket, you know, the whole nation and people start to grow that discernment.
[01:59:14.707 --> 01:59:17.969]  That we've, you know, that we've blocked off for a very long time.
[01:59:18.089 --> 01:59:20.710]  Well, let me tell you, I've been receiving the transmissions.
[01:59:21.571 --> 01:59:33.358]  I mean, the stuff, the stuff I'm getting now, the downloads I'm getting is just like, I can't even, it's like, I mean, I get downloads now in the middle of the night and in the morning that are just like total under, but it's like, I'm like just a human though.
[01:59:33.378 --> 01:59:35.319]  I can't grasp it, but I can see it.
[01:59:35.719 --> 01:59:37.560]  And then I, it's like, how do you articulate it?
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:38.181]  It's unbelievable.
[01:59:39.922 --> 01:59:42.323]  What I, what I think we need to do is, you know,
[01:59:43.286 --> 01:59:59.746]  The American people, we've become so laxed and comfortable with ourselves on the nation itself that we've kind of stopped doing what we need to be doing, and that's praying.
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:00.900]  Absolutely.
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:02.201]  Opening the channel up to God.
[02:00:02.341 --> 02:00:12.946]  You're totally right, and I think our New Year's resolution is prayer, quietly with God, opening up to God, asking God to give us the data and the info and what to do, and just not asking God.
[02:00:13.106 --> 02:00:15.388]  People think you pray to tell God what you want.
[02:00:15.448 --> 02:00:15.688]  No.
[02:00:16.268 --> 02:00:29.215]  You pray that God use you and lift you up to be a vessel, even though you're imperfect, and you ask God to help you purify yourself with God's will, and then God will begin to work with you
[02:00:30.236 --> 02:00:31.297]  Like someone sculpting.
[02:00:32.198 --> 02:00:46.311]  And I think what we should do is, you know, before, you know, everybody heads out to Washington, you know, the day before, you know, I think we, on, you know, over some radio waves, I think we all need to just take a minute or two and pray together, you know, over your show.
[02:00:47.132 --> 02:00:55.940]  And, you know, we need to, you know, we need to give that time, you know, for ourselves, you know, together, because the power comes in numbers, of course, and that's why
[02:00:56.989 --> 02:01:03.772]  And that's why they're scared of real churches, and that's why they're scared of real people joining hands, because it's all energetic, it's all spiritual, it's all a choice.
[02:01:03.832 --> 02:01:04.512]  Beautiful, John.
[02:01:04.632 --> 02:01:05.092]  I love you.
[02:01:05.652 --> 02:01:07.513]  And you're absolutely right, that should be our New Year's resolution.
[02:01:07.573 --> 02:01:09.714]  I humbly second your nomination.
[02:01:10.394 --> 02:01:12.135]  All right, let's talk to Steve in Oregon.
[02:01:12.175 --> 02:01:12.755]  Welcome, Steve.
[02:01:14.095 --> 02:01:14.596]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:15.176 --> 02:01:16.736]  Listen, two points.
[02:01:17.377 --> 02:01:22.739]  I just received your six-pack at 60% off.
[02:01:23.359 --> 02:01:24.539]  Man, I'm really impressed.
[02:01:24.619 --> 02:01:25.760]  That vaso beat.
[02:01:26.949 --> 02:01:29.090]  It's wonderful, and so is that Ultra 12.
[02:01:29.130 --> 02:01:30.811]  I haven't had a chance to try all of them yet.
[02:01:31.491 --> 02:01:36.774]  But if people don't buy that six-pack combo for 60% off, they are missing out.
[02:01:37.334 --> 02:01:42.516]  Second one is Sheriff Mack out of Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:01:42.536 --> 02:01:43.357]  Don't know whether you know him.
[02:01:43.377 --> 02:01:47.479]  He has police officers and sheriff's constitutional group.
[02:01:47.679 --> 02:01:50.140]  He took a case to the Supreme Court and won.
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:52.821]  Yes, I know Sheriff Mack well.
[02:01:52.861 --> 02:01:54.282]  I've been friends with him for 25 years.
[02:01:55.342 --> 02:01:55.822]  Oh, wonderful.
[02:01:55.842 --> 02:01:59.403]  So you know all about constitutional sheriffing, so that's great.
[02:01:59.623 --> 02:02:14.968]  And the other one, I just made a call to our local sheriff, said three of us here in our small little town, ranch town here in Oregon, want to meet with him concerning our state of the county and how we can focus on things, and people need to educate there.
[02:02:15.703 --> 02:02:22.408]  Sheriff on the constitutionality of their job and upholding the Constitution, and we have to do that locally.
[02:02:22.428 --> 02:02:23.929]  So that's really all I got.
[02:02:24.029 --> 02:02:24.429]  Love you.
[02:02:24.469 --> 02:02:25.209]  Love the products.
[02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:30.813]  And people, if you don't get that six-pack for 60% off, you have missed the deal of the year.
[02:02:31.113 --> 02:02:34.916]  That's the Revitalize what Recharge Turbocharge six-pack for the New Year.
[02:02:34.936 --> 02:02:35.196]  There it is.
[02:02:35.216 --> 02:02:38.378]  New Year's Resolution Revitalize and Energize Pack.
[02:02:38.418 --> 02:02:39.359]  Thank you so much, brother.
[02:02:40.558 --> 02:02:41.379]  Yeah, that's got it all.
[02:02:41.419 --> 02:02:44.301]  I've been religiously taking the supplements again and I'm already getting more energy.
[02:02:44.401 --> 02:02:47.603]  I got really messed up during the campaign and after and stopped working out.
[02:02:47.623 --> 02:02:50.906]  I'm sort of just eating like a total pig and drinking too much again.
[02:02:50.966 --> 02:02:52.647]  I've quit drinking again, thank God.
[02:02:53.648 --> 02:02:54.088]  Cut back.
[02:02:54.589 --> 02:03:02.515]  I think I had like one glass of champagne on Christmas, but I just... I'm working myself to death, but hell, this is the time to do it, isn't it?
[02:03:03.493 --> 02:03:04.513]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:03:32.813 --> 02:03:33.133]  Welcome.
[02:03:33.273 --> 02:03:33.853]  What's on your mind?
[02:03:37.614 --> 02:03:42.276]  Yeah, I heard him take the call and then... We'll go back to Jeff in a minute if his cell phone comes back.
[02:03:42.296 --> 02:03:43.536]  Oh, he's been holding a while.
[02:03:44.216 --> 02:03:46.397]  Let's go to Ben in Arizona.
[02:03:46.437 --> 02:03:46.917]  Go ahead, Ben.
[02:03:48.097 --> 02:03:50.058]  Hey, Alex Jones, my brother.
[02:03:50.098 --> 02:03:51.098]  How you doing today?
[02:03:51.558 --> 02:03:54.599]  You know, I am absolutely supercharged.
[02:03:54.639 --> 02:03:55.699]  The spirit is strong.
[02:03:55.879 --> 02:03:59.080]  The flesh isn't as willing as it used to be, but my spirit's stronger than ever.
[02:04:00.106 --> 02:04:02.088]  Oh yeah, Holy Spirit is definitely talking through you.
[02:04:03.449 --> 02:04:05.470]  I just wanted to do a quick plug for Honor Roll.
[02:04:05.490 --> 02:04:09.573]  My kids love that supplement, and I really do hope you guys get it back in stock.
[02:04:10.514 --> 02:04:14.557]  You know, the supplier of that with COVID has been shut down for 11 months or so.
[02:04:14.897 --> 02:04:17.419]  We're going to have to either get a new supplier or something.
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:18.260]  So thanks.
[02:04:19.561 --> 02:04:23.904]  Well, I've been giving them the krill oil and all that stuff for them, so they're really liking that.
[02:04:23.964 --> 02:04:29.649]  But just wanted to touch bases with you with March on DC, or the occupation of DC.
[02:04:30.490 --> 02:04:39.393]  I think that you... I'm going to talk to all the Cajun Navy and all these people that did boat parades for the past three to four months.
[02:04:40.054 --> 02:04:44.775]  We need to have every single one of those people plug up the Potomac.
[02:04:45.256 --> 02:04:47.477]  Because you know... That is a genius idea!
[02:04:47.537 --> 02:04:49.257]  And can you get boats on the Potomac?
[02:04:51.218 --> 02:04:57.540]  Well, I can set out some Facebook posts and stuff, but... No, what I'm asking you is, I don't see a lot of boats on the Potomac.
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:04:58.981]  I mean, boats can get on the Potomac, can't they?
[02:05:00.233 --> 02:05:02.715]  Yeah, well, I'm sure they can, especially like the Cajun Navy.
[02:05:02.755 --> 02:05:05.718]  When the hurricanes come in, they have to go in there and help get people out.
[02:05:07.519 --> 02:05:07.860]  I agree.
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:11.463]  Well, we need to see the Cajun Navy come in and then get on the ground with us, but I totally agree.
[02:05:11.763 --> 02:05:20.771]  We need to see... Well, because I'm looking at it, if they tie up those boats, even if they try to shut down those bridges, and that's a free... you can get into... I mean, that's a... that's a public area.
[02:05:21.191 --> 02:05:22.032]  Tie up those boats.
[02:05:22.052 --> 02:05:25.235]  If they try to shut down those bridges, just imagine the InfoWar Army
[02:05:25.635 --> 02:05:27.316]  And by the way, let me tell you what this is about.
[02:05:27.356 --> 02:05:28.376]  It's about global government.
[02:05:28.397 --> 02:05:29.297]  It's about lockdowns.
[02:05:29.337 --> 02:05:30.057]  It's about control.
[02:05:30.117 --> 02:05:32.018]  That's what the whole COVID hoax is about.
[02:05:32.318 --> 02:05:36.601]  But they want it where if your QR code doesn't let you go, your car won't start.
[02:05:37.221 --> 02:05:39.622]  They admit that they want to end demonstrations.
[02:05:39.662 --> 02:05:42.003]  They are so scared of everybody coming to D.C.
[02:05:42.123 --> 02:05:43.344]  Everybody's got to come, Ben.
[02:05:43.604 --> 02:05:44.825]  God bless you, and I appreciate your call.
[02:05:46.561 --> 02:05:51.424]  A lot of great points here, but the New Year's Resolution is go see your sheriffs, educate them.
[02:05:51.524 --> 02:05:52.165]  Great idea.
[02:05:52.705 --> 02:05:53.686]  New Year's Resolution.
[02:05:53.866 --> 02:05:54.927]  Educate people every day.
[02:05:55.007 --> 02:05:55.847]  New Year's Resolution.
[02:05:56.228 --> 02:06:01.391]  Tell folks about the banned videos, the forbidden videos, the verboten information at banned.video.
[02:06:01.411 --> 02:06:02.792]  New Year's Resolution.
[02:06:02.872 --> 02:06:03.472]  Pray more.
[02:06:03.573 --> 02:06:04.213]  Get active.
[02:06:04.273 --> 02:06:04.813]  Stand up.
[02:06:05.054 --> 02:06:05.574]  Speak out.
[02:06:05.674 --> 02:06:06.254]  Get healthy.
[02:06:06.755 --> 02:06:07.595]  Treat everybody better.
[02:06:07.675 --> 02:06:08.216]  Be good.
[02:06:09.196 --> 02:06:10.117]  Don't be arrogant.
[02:06:10.157 --> 02:06:10.897]  I'm talking to myself.
[02:06:11.858 --> 02:06:13.920]  Let's talk to, let's see if Jeff's phone's back.
[02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:15.801]  Jeff, you in a better spot now up in Canada?
[02:06:17.421 --> 02:06:18.282]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[02:06:18.502 --> 02:06:19.283]  I can now, go ahead.
[02:06:20.824 --> 02:06:33.754]  Hey Alex, just want to wish you a Happy New Year and just want to remind people, the Book of Revelation says that there's going to come a time where we have to take something called the Mark of the Beast, which you won't be able to buy, sell, or trade without that mark.
[02:06:34.595 --> 02:06:45.844]  And the speculation is that there's a connection with the vaccines and another point I want to make on that before I get to what I called in about is
[02:06:46.767 --> 02:06:58.162]  When your DNA changes and you cease to become human, there will come a point where you actually are not under the covenant of God because Christ died for human beings.
[02:06:58.342 --> 02:07:00.865]  He didn't die for hybrids.
[02:07:00.885 --> 02:07:03.028]  And that's a very important point that
[02:07:03.564 --> 02:07:05.286]  People are going to have to consider.
[02:07:05.346 --> 02:07:13.975]  This may be the top of the slide, but once you start taking the vaccine, there will come a time where you will willingly alter your genetics.
[02:07:14.436 --> 02:07:23.085]  And at that point, you will take what's called the Mark of the Beast and give allegiance to Lucifer, who's in charge of this whole demonic system.
[02:07:24.005 --> 02:07:25.606]  That's right, and he impregnates you.
[02:07:25.946 --> 02:07:26.487]  Well, stay there.
[02:07:26.507 --> 02:07:27.247]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:07:27.347 --> 02:07:27.688]  Don't hang up.
[02:07:27.988 --> 02:07:30.029]  There's foreshadowing throughout the Bible.
[02:07:30.269 --> 02:07:34.032]  There's a lot of foreshadowing in the books before, and things just repeat.
[02:07:34.072 --> 02:07:43.098]  But if you actually read what they break down in Revelations, and in Ezekiel, and in Daniel, and in Leviticus, and all of it, you have to worship the beast.
[02:07:43.118 --> 02:07:44.379]  You have to do everything it says.
[02:07:44.739 --> 02:07:46.941]  You have to be under its total control.
[02:07:47.561 --> 02:07:52.165]  And there are these giant images of the beast, 50, 100 feet tall, in the public places, in the markets.
[02:07:53.326 --> 02:07:54.107]  That you worship.
[02:07:54.887 --> 02:07:58.790]  And then you have to ask questions of the beast and it will give you answers.
[02:07:58.850 --> 02:07:59.610]  It will do wonders.
[02:07:59.670 --> 02:08:00.611]  It will give you miracles.
[02:08:00.691 --> 02:08:01.531]  It will give you health.
[02:08:02.672 --> 02:08:12.078]  And it describes the beast having like all these little metal locusts and dragonflies flying around watching and controlling everyone.
[02:08:13.868 --> 02:08:22.212]  And whole cities being vaporized in fire, and all these big governments warring with each other, and it all just falls apart, and then disintegrates.
[02:08:22.912 --> 02:08:31.517]  Well, whether you believe that's going to happen or not, the globalists have used it as a model, and they're bringing in a world government, and they describe it as a mark and ten kingdoms, just like the Bible says.
[02:08:32.877 --> 02:08:34.778]  So go read Revelation about the Mark of the Beast.
[02:08:34.818 --> 02:08:40.641]  Go read about what is unfolding, and then realize that I remember 25 years ago,
[02:08:43.626 --> 02:08:45.707]  That was a preacher, they found his name again the other day.
[02:08:46.887 --> 02:08:48.247]  Ask Wes, he'll remember the guy's name.
[02:08:48.267 --> 02:08:51.568]  We need to find out if that guy's still around, still alive.
[02:08:51.809 --> 02:08:54.129]  Wasn't that old then, he's probably like 55 then.
[02:08:55.370 --> 02:08:58.571]  And he said, I said, yeah, it'll be, you know, a scan of your hand, a scan of your face.
[02:08:58.591 --> 02:09:03.732]  He said, no, it'll be a vaccine you're forced to take that changes your DNA and takes over your body.
[02:09:03.752 --> 02:09:05.593]  And I said, how do you know that?
[02:09:05.613 --> 02:09:08.474]  And he said, oh, my pastor had a vision.
[02:09:09.894 --> 02:09:12.015]  Now, that's coming true now.
[02:09:15.049 --> 02:09:28.078]  This is Bill Gates literally impregnating you with a foreign alien DNA of a cloned child mixed with a jellyfish just in the Pfizer document that then changes in a chain reaction every cell in your body.
[02:09:28.458 --> 02:09:36.103]  But eggs in a woman's ovaries, those are done when she's formed as a baby in the mother's womb.
[02:09:36.143 --> 02:09:37.464]  She has the eggs left for her life.
[02:09:38.064 --> 02:09:40.226]  Sperm are formed continually and
[02:09:42.079 --> 02:09:42.600]  Your eyes.
[02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:43.561]  Your eye cells.
[02:09:44.302 --> 02:09:45.444]  Everything will be rewritten.
[02:09:45.984 --> 02:09:47.266]  I mean, this is so drastic.
[02:09:47.286 --> 02:09:51.412]  Like, alien, uh, meteorite hits and starts taking over like the Bob.
[02:09:51.652 --> 02:09:52.413]  I mean, this is it.
[02:09:52.493 --> 02:09:54.777]  So, Jeff, pretty incredible times to be alive, my friend.
[02:09:56.721 --> 02:09:57.621]  Yeah, it sure is, Alex.
[02:09:58.382 --> 02:10:08.686]  You know, years ago on YouTube I watched something called, this guy, they've isolated what's called the God Gene, which is your way that you respond to God.
[02:10:08.706 --> 02:10:17.610]  I don't know if that's true or not, but with the Trojan crapshoot that they're putting in these vaccines, there may come a time where you take something and you're gone.
[02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:19.151]  You just can't come back.
[02:10:19.611 --> 02:10:30.018]  The Bible says that the first two people to enter the lake of fire, which is not the judgment seat of God, but they go straight into the lake of fire, are the false prophet and the antichrist.
[02:10:30.339 --> 02:10:37.203]  But it says everybody that takes the mark of the beast joins him with the devil in the ultimate judgment in the lake of fire.
[02:10:37.584 --> 02:10:42.547]  Now, I didn't write that, but that's what it says, and it all seems to be coming to pass.
[02:10:42.687 --> 02:10:43.728]  My contention is this.
[02:10:44.471 --> 02:10:52.314]  We have therapeutic, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which are extremely effective in fighting this vaccine.
[02:10:52.674 --> 02:10:58.436]  We need to come up, we need to be- And they're not letting us have it because they want to keep us in fear forever, this is a problem that never ends.
[02:10:58.456 --> 02:11:00.757]  Hey, move on from the Bible, though it's central and key.
[02:11:01.037 --> 02:11:05.759]  But for secular folks, Gigi Ping a month ago said you'll have a QR code to buy and sell and travel.
[02:11:06.019 --> 02:11:08.120]  Now it's officially announced, CNN says you must have it.
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:09.721]  They're just doing it.
[02:11:10.121 --> 02:11:12.302]  It's a total authoritarian takeover.
[02:11:13.527 --> 02:11:15.995]  Alright, we've got some big announcements, some other news to hit.
[02:11:16.115 --> 02:11:17.920]  Owen Schroer is going to lead a demonstration tonight.
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:20.500]  11 p.m at the W downtown.
[02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:21.441]  People should do this everywhere.
[02:11:21.861 --> 02:11:22.681]  I'm going to be there too.
[02:11:23.181 --> 02:11:27.963]  We're going to live stream it at Infowars.com and Newswars.com and Band.video.
[02:11:28.003 --> 02:11:35.545]  So I think the volunteers are going to stand here tonight so that when we go out downtown to protest against the martial law he's declared.
[02:11:35.605 --> 02:11:37.225]  The governor says his martial law is illegal.
[02:11:37.605 --> 02:11:42.266]  He can't say that everybody's not essential and that bars and restaurants are closed so they're staying open.
[02:11:42.307 --> 02:11:43.587]  All the corporate things are going to stay
[02:11:44.147 --> 02:11:46.809]  Close because he said so because they want to bankrupt everybody else.
[02:11:47.230 --> 02:11:50.173]  See when they have the order, they close for a few days and no one else is allowed to open.
[02:11:50.433 --> 02:11:51.494]  But they open back up.
[02:11:52.174 --> 02:11:53.536]  It's a systematic demonic plan.
[02:11:55.137 --> 02:12:01.603]  Also, I've got a clarification and an apology I need to make because when I've been led astray and made mistakes, I want to own up to those.
[02:12:01.983 --> 02:12:03.425]  So I'll do that on the other side.
[02:12:04.534 --> 02:12:07.076]  We're back, ladies and gentlemen, in 60 seconds.
[02:12:07.116 --> 02:12:10.819]  Newswars.com, Infowars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[02:12:11.079 --> 02:12:13.140]  And this is the final Alex Jones transmission of 2020.
[02:12:13.501 --> 02:12:14.762]  We shall fight!
[02:12:15.762 --> 02:12:17.524]  And we shall never surrender!
[02:12:17.544 --> 02:12:20.446]  And the good news is, the bad news.
[02:12:21.487 --> 02:12:23.768]  Things are getting really serious, really quick.
[02:12:24.449 --> 02:12:27.511]  It's gonna separate the boys from the men, the women from the girls.
[02:12:29.873 --> 02:12:30.954]  The goats from the sheep.
[02:12:31.874 --> 02:12:33.496]  Okay, Owen's got some big announcements.
[02:12:34.605 --> 02:12:37.888]  He's here riding shotgun with us, but let me cover this right now.
[02:12:39.169 --> 02:12:43.373]  I know what Trump has gone through at a microcosm level in the swamp in DC.
[02:12:44.835 --> 02:12:47.577]  You know that I don't organize a lot of events around the country.
[02:12:47.737 --> 02:12:50.080]  We've had them over the years.
[02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:52.362]  16, 17 years ago, I was having events with 5,000, 6,000, 10,000 people at them.
[02:12:55.663 --> 02:12:58.584]  We open up venues and sell out of tickets in hours.
[02:12:59.365 --> 02:13:00.625]  And you would come out to those events.
[02:13:00.746 --> 02:13:04.207]  But then the left would bomb, threat them, and cause all these problems.
[02:13:05.568 --> 02:13:11.971]  We can reach so many people making films, documentaries, putting out reports, and doing live digital media that we stopped doing it.
[02:13:12.671 --> 02:13:15.653]  But now because of the censorship, we've gone back into the street and third dimension.
[02:13:17.133 --> 02:13:20.036]  So, we came before the Tea Party.
[02:13:20.557 --> 02:13:22.019]  We came before Ron Paul.
[02:13:22.059 --> 02:13:23.761]  We came before he ran for president.
[02:13:23.941 --> 02:13:28.627]  Before all of that, you, this audience, are the hardcore Americans that were aware of what was going on.
[02:13:28.687 --> 02:13:29.848]  You sought us out.
[02:13:30.429 --> 02:13:31.710]  You are the lifeblood of this.
[02:13:33.352 --> 02:13:35.855]  So, I got contacted by the Trump White House.
[02:13:35.895 --> 02:13:37.257]  I got contacted by the State Department.
[02:13:38.630 --> 02:13:47.394]  And they said to me, hey, when you try to rally people in Arizona, in Georgia, in D.C., and here are some of the folks we're working with.
[02:13:48.194 --> 02:13:50.095]  And so I work with those folks, and they're nice people.
[02:13:51.575 --> 02:13:52.976]  Then I get called to go to D.C.
[02:13:53.536 --> 02:13:54.637]  Roger Stone gets called.
[02:13:54.677 --> 02:13:55.417]  He's going there.
[02:13:55.537 --> 02:14:00.959]  And then he gets told, oh, you've been knocked off the thing from one of the main events.
[02:14:00.979 --> 02:14:01.619]  You're not going to speak.
[02:14:01.699 --> 02:14:02.820]  Roger pulls out, doesn't go.
[02:14:03.863 --> 02:14:08.669]  I get told, oh yeah, the organizers are bad folks, whatever, you know, we need to get out of the Supreme Court and lead our own deal.
[02:14:09.029 --> 02:14:10.571]  I went and did it, it was a big deal, great.
[02:14:11.172 --> 02:14:16.338]  And I said some mean things that I'd heard from others about the organizers, and really this is all just fog of war stuff.
[02:14:16.918 --> 02:14:22.084]  Then I come to the next event, and I'm speaking at the Jericho March and a bunch of other big marches.
[02:14:23.078 --> 02:14:28.340]  And I did, because I'd been, you know, told not to like the folks that were doing the other big event over at Freedom Plaza.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:34.701]  I did go over there, because you couldn't even hear what they were doing on their speaker system, you know, 500 yards away, the crowds were so big.
[02:14:35.082 --> 02:14:37.402]  And I'd been told Trump was about to probably come.
[02:14:37.862 --> 02:14:42.604]  I spoke there, General Flynn was there, to the big Jericho deal on the mall.
[02:14:43.024 --> 02:14:46.165]  So I went over there, because we were waiting a few hours before I was going to speak, and I said,
[02:14:47.378 --> 02:14:51.343]  You need to come over here, you know, basically once you're done here.
[02:14:52.124 --> 02:15:02.558]  Now, once I got to the Jericho March, I was told when this is over at 3.30, march everybody down to the Supreme Court because there's another event that people are putting on there.
[02:15:03.922 --> 02:15:06.864]  And I'm told that by the people, some of the folks involved with the Jericho March.
[02:15:06.944 --> 02:15:08.605]  I don't even really know what's going on.
[02:15:09.185 --> 02:15:10.306]  I'm at my hotel eating.
[02:15:10.646 --> 02:15:12.267]  My crew's like, you gotta go.
[02:15:12.867 --> 02:15:13.928]  You gotta get down there.
[02:15:13.968 --> 02:15:14.729]  You said you were going.
[02:15:14.769 --> 02:15:15.529]  I'm like, I'm tired.
[02:15:15.569 --> 02:15:16.049]  I don't want to do it.
[02:15:16.570 --> 02:15:18.591]  So then, because they had the roads all blocked.
[02:15:18.651 --> 02:15:20.832]  So then we walked a couple miles to the Supreme Court.
[02:15:23.014 --> 02:15:23.634]  Or no, halfway.
[02:15:23.654 --> 02:15:24.755]  The truck got us about halfway.
[02:15:25.455 --> 02:15:28.537]  And I'm walking up and these big security guys come running up.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.662]  And run into us and say, you're not taking this over.
[02:15:33.142 --> 02:15:34.703]  So we start to kind of push with them and stuff.
[02:15:34.783 --> 02:15:38.585]  And then I can't see what's going on, you know, over the little hill there at Supreme Court.
[02:15:38.605 --> 02:15:39.206]  I go, forget it.
[02:15:39.266 --> 02:15:39.726]  I don't care.
[02:15:40.106 --> 02:15:40.747]  We'll go over here.
[02:15:40.767 --> 02:15:43.489]  Well, the whole crowd that I already told to be there follows me.
[02:15:44.209 --> 02:15:45.630]  So now I see what this looked like.
[02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:51.894]  I did go take over one of their events earlier in the day to bring some of the people to the Jericho March.
[02:15:52.875 --> 02:15:53.735]  I was mad at him.
[02:15:53.875 --> 02:15:54.816]  I was being a stinker.
[02:15:56.772 --> 02:15:57.913]  And so I apologize for that.
[02:15:57.973 --> 02:16:03.215]  But when I came to the next event at the Supreme Court, I was told that that was somebody else's event, and that wasn't true.
[02:16:03.575 --> 02:16:09.038]  And so there's a lot of these groups manipulating, playing each other off, fighting with each other, and I'm not in the middle of that.
[02:16:09.418 --> 02:16:10.299]  I'm not involved in that.
[02:16:10.319 --> 02:16:12.540]  So let me just say this here on air.
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:15.601]  You've got Women for America First, who do great events around the country.
[02:16:16.081 --> 02:16:18.282]  I don't know hardly anything about them except that they've been around 15 years.
[02:16:20.302 --> 02:16:21.502]  They put on a bunch of big deals.
[02:16:21.662 --> 02:16:25.044]  I think Amy Kramer and Kylie Kramer, her daughter, are overall great people.
[02:16:25.064 --> 02:16:26.024]  They've done a great job.
[02:16:26.884 --> 02:16:30.585]  Particularly Kylie, because I did see her at the same hotel we were staying at.
[02:16:30.906 --> 02:16:36.207]  And I did roll down the window the night before the event and smart mouthily said, you're not keeping me from anything.
[02:16:36.227 --> 02:16:37.588]  I'm going to take over your event tomorrow.
[02:16:38.274 --> 02:16:54.761]  Well then, no wonder, when I then get told, go down to the thing of the Supreme Court, I show up, there's securities there waiting for me, they run into us, you see me on video say, forget it, we'll go, and then they call up Millie Weaver and go, look, he's attacking Millie Weaver, she wasn't speaking when I got there.
[02:16:55.021 --> 02:16:56.602]  I like Millie, she used to work here.
[02:16:57.042 --> 02:17:06.846]  So, I apologize to Millie, and I apologize to Kylie Kramer, I did say something smart-mouthed to Kylie, and we don't need to end fight, it's all stupid, it doesn't matter.
[02:17:07.728 --> 02:17:08.768]  And here's why I tell the rest of the story.
[02:17:09.149 --> 02:17:11.830]  No one was going to end up paying for the event that Trump said.
[02:17:12.470 --> 02:17:14.511]  Because that has to be privately put on when Trump does an event.
[02:17:14.551 --> 02:17:15.171]  Donors have to do it.
[02:17:15.611 --> 02:17:16.412]  Everybody's deserted Trump.
[02:17:16.432 --> 02:17:18.413]  Nobody was going to pay for the event on the 5th either.
[02:17:19.193 --> 02:17:20.634]  I went ahead and paid the down payments.
[02:17:21.274 --> 02:17:27.917]  And then like biblically, the widows might, the phone rings and this big donor reimburses me the money.
[02:17:28.497 --> 02:17:30.718]  Literally offers me the amount of money I just paid.
[02:17:31.478 --> 02:17:32.179]  She's a great lady.
[02:17:33.257 --> 02:17:37.018]  And then all the infighting with all these groups turns up and gets crazy.
[02:17:37.038 --> 02:17:38.458]  And I just said, I prayed about it.
[02:17:38.558 --> 02:17:42.219]  And I said, I told some other folks last week, I said, I'm going to apologize to the Kramers.
[02:17:42.639 --> 02:17:43.599]  Like, well, they're not perfect.
[02:17:43.639 --> 02:17:44.399]  Well, nobody is.
[02:17:44.759 --> 02:17:45.699]  I'm going to apologize.
[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:46.980]  And I'm going to tell the story on air.
[02:17:47.300 --> 02:17:49.020]  So people know what really happened.
[02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:51.681]  And so I apologize to women for America.
[02:17:51.701 --> 02:17:57.842]  First, you're doing a great job and they are putting on the big deal on the ellipse on the six that I'll also be at with Roger Stone.
[02:17:57.862 --> 02:17:58.122]  So there.
[02:17:58.382 --> 02:17:59.002]  Hatchett's buried.
[02:17:59.162 --> 02:18:13.646]  But let's play some of the footage of what really happened at the Supreme Court at the last DC event, where you see, I don't see Millie up there, I see a guy kind of in a Santa Claus outfit, kind of a cool outfit I guess, a nice guy I'm told, and I get pushed away and I leave, and I go across the street and everybody follows me.
[02:18:13.666 --> 02:18:16.306]  I feel like I'm desperate for a crowd, anywhere I go I get a crowd there.
[02:18:16.667 --> 02:18:18.987]  So, that's what happened, here's the truth, here's the footage.
[02:18:24.927 --> 02:18:28.494]  This happens on Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWars!
[02:18:34.915 --> 02:18:38.117]  At four o'clock today, we're gonna march back to the Supreme Court.
[02:18:38.857 --> 02:18:40.718]  You got some other great folks at Freedom Plaza.
[02:18:40.918 --> 02:18:42.799]  If some of you aren't here later, go get them.
[02:18:43.139 --> 02:18:45.840]  Lead them to the Supreme Court at four, at this great event.
[02:18:46.201 --> 02:18:48.742]  But pray for America, pray for the world, pray for Trump.
[02:18:48.822 --> 02:18:50.082]  I didn't know they were putting on, too.
[02:18:50.202 --> 02:18:51.123]  I'm just saying, go to the next event.
[02:18:51.163 --> 02:18:51.623]  I was told to.
[02:18:52.023 --> 02:18:53.524]  But with Trump, it's as close as it got.
[02:18:53.784 --> 02:18:55.565]  Look how far we've come.
[02:18:56.045 --> 02:18:57.746]  Look at what we've been able to do.
[02:18:58.006 --> 02:18:59.567]  And this is just the beginning.
[02:18:59.827 --> 02:19:01.048]  So we're at the back of the crowd.
[02:19:01.128 --> 02:19:02.008]  These guys run up.
[02:19:02.688 --> 02:19:03.429]  And this is what happens.
[02:19:04.332 --> 02:19:05.453]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:05.493 --> 02:19:06.454]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:06.514 --> 02:19:07.455]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:07.495 --> 02:19:08.395]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:08.416 --> 02:19:09.296]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:09.336 --> 02:19:10.177]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:10.217 --> 02:19:10.978]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:10.998 --> 02:19:11.618]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:11.638 --> 02:19:12.419]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:12.439 --> 02:19:13.160]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:13.880]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:14.681]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:14.701 --> 02:19:15.442]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:15.462 --> 02:19:16.602]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:16.623 --> 02:19:17.483]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:17.523 --> 02:19:18.644]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:18.664 --> 02:19:19.865]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:19.885 --> 02:19:20.866]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:20.886 --> 02:19:22.227]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:22.267 --> 02:19:22.888]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:22.908 --> 02:19:23.869]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:23.889 --> 02:19:24.589]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:24.609 --> 02:19:25.670]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:25.770 --> 02:19:26.591]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:26.611 --> 02:19:27.592]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:27.632 --> 02:19:28.373]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:28.413 --> 02:19:29.253]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:29.273 --> 02:19:30.034]  You're not allowed to be here.
[02:19:32.065 --> 02:19:33.626]  And so the crowd's there, they're my fans.
[02:19:33.686 --> 02:19:36.988]  I go across the street, everybody follows, and they just stop the rally and leave.
[02:19:37.028 --> 02:19:38.668]  It was supposed to be over anyways.
[02:19:40.209 --> 02:19:42.991]  And so what I didn't know is I guess their rally was ending at 4 or 5 or whatever.
[02:19:43.031 --> 02:19:43.751]  I don't even care.
[02:19:43.911 --> 02:19:50.695]  But I get the guy in the red suit, you know, thought that I was there to take over their precious event.
[02:19:50.775 --> 02:19:52.075]  I got millions of audience every day.
[02:19:52.095 --> 02:19:53.096]  I won't take anything home.
[02:19:55.700 --> 02:20:08.146]  Now, minutes later, keep going, they call Millie Weaver up, and I like Millie, but she knows that the guy calls her up after I was already across the street, and she says I came to disrupt her.
[02:20:08.206 --> 02:20:09.427]  Millie, I don't have a crystal ball.
[02:20:09.447 --> 02:20:10.207]  I didn't know that.
[02:20:12.429 --> 02:20:13.589]  Never try to disrupt her deal.
[02:20:16.164 --> 02:20:20.327]  And so again, I'm already across the street, the crowd's followed me, and then they call Millie up so she can be a victim.
[02:20:20.747 --> 02:20:22.509]  That's not the Kramers, and that's not that guy.
[02:20:22.549 --> 02:20:23.349]  He didn't even know what was going on.
[02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:24.050]  It's not even Millie.
[02:20:24.450 --> 02:20:26.511]  It's just we're primed to be victims in this society.
[02:20:26.711 --> 02:20:27.392]  So I'll say it.
[02:20:27.812 --> 02:20:32.055]  I'm the bad guy, I apologize to Millie, and I apologize to Santa Claus, dude.
[02:20:32.676 --> 02:20:34.257]  And I'm not being mean, it's kind of a cool Santa Claus.
[02:20:34.277 --> 02:20:35.658]  He is wearing a Santa Claus outfit, folks.
[02:20:36.558 --> 02:20:39.981]  But seriously, I'm not going to have that happen at these events next week.
[02:20:40.262 --> 02:20:41.423]  It isn't about infighting.
[02:20:41.583 --> 02:20:45.025]  It's about millions and millions on the street, you being in the crowd.
[02:20:45.046 --> 02:20:46.226]  It's not about the speeches.
[02:20:46.687 --> 02:20:47.448]  It's not about that.
[02:20:47.548 --> 02:20:52.592]  It's about Trump giving a speech saying he's not going to concede and us standing with him and occupying DC.
[02:20:52.832 --> 02:20:53.793]  Owen, 30 second comment.
[02:20:54.175 --> 02:20:59.858]  Well, I was there for the entire series of events you just described and, I mean, it is entirely factually correct.
[02:21:00.138 --> 02:21:02.199]  The problem is, look, there's always going to be infighting.
[02:21:02.219 --> 02:21:08.602]  These are just, you know, tense times and, you know, our problem is we're like the Lone Rangers out here in Texas, you know.
[02:21:08.823 --> 02:21:09.743]  They live in D.C.
[02:21:09.783 --> 02:21:10.623]  They live in New York.
[02:21:10.663 --> 02:21:11.604]  That's kind of their thing.
[02:21:11.944 --> 02:21:13.105]  We're just like berserkers.
[02:21:13.245 --> 02:21:14.185]  Like, we're just in a war.
[02:21:14.205 --> 02:21:18.307]  It's like we don't have time to analyze all the little blades of grass on the battlefield.
[02:21:18.347 --> 02:21:20.068]  We charge in, have a victory, and leave.
[02:21:20.108 --> 02:21:21.289]  And so, it's all right, though.
[02:21:21.309 --> 02:21:22.870]  We're all learning to get along and that's a good thing.
[02:21:23.610 --> 02:21:23.910]  That's right.
[02:21:23.930 --> 02:21:27.552]  Let's talk about a demonstration we're having tonight, which everyone's welcome to come to at 11 o'clock.
[02:21:27.612 --> 02:21:28.493]  No one's in charge.
[02:21:28.753 --> 02:21:29.313]  We'll be right back.
[02:21:43.228 --> 02:21:44.089]  I think it went overboard.
[02:21:44.109 --> 02:21:45.629]  I think the Kramers have done a great job.
[02:21:45.649 --> 02:21:46.150]  We love Kylie.
[02:21:46.390 --> 02:21:48.111]  And I have the permit.
[02:21:48.211 --> 02:21:50.072]  We have the whole permit for the fifth.
[02:22:07.395 --> 02:22:11.016]  I'm inviting them to come speak at our event, and I'm inviting Millie Weaver to come speak.
[02:22:11.477 --> 02:22:12.117]  So there you go.
[02:22:12.197 --> 02:22:15.398]  At the big event in Freedom Plaza, and we're working with them on the 6th.
[02:22:15.438 --> 02:22:21.300]  So, I mean, again, it's not like you speak and you're a movie star, and these are like Oscars we're handing out.
[02:22:22.121 --> 02:22:27.623]  This is about the demonstration, it's about saying no to the globalists, but that's why we all need to come together, Owen.
[02:22:28.717 --> 02:22:34.541]  Yeah, and that's been part of the problem, I think, with the conservative side of the aisle, is it's just like trying to herd cats.
[02:22:34.581 --> 02:22:41.665]  I mean, we have our own independent thoughts, we have our own independent ways of approaching things and doing things, so it just kind of comes with the territory.
[02:22:41.685 --> 02:22:46.809]  But, you know, we've never really been forced with, you know, this
[02:22:47.529 --> 02:22:50.552]  This time where we have to get along and we're going to lose everything.
[02:22:50.592 --> 02:22:54.155]  It's the, you know, unite or fall apart.
[02:22:54.175 --> 02:22:58.719]  When you get a million or two million people on the ground, it's hard as hell to run that.
[02:22:58.739 --> 02:23:00.020]  So I think things are going great.
[02:23:00.260 --> 02:23:05.665]  What matters is there's no air coverage like on the first one showing over a million people or close to a million.
[02:23:05.925 --> 02:23:09.408]  We need somehow to show it's going to be down all the side streets, down the roads.
[02:23:09.428 --> 02:23:11.170]  This is the beginning of the occupation of D.C.
[02:23:11.770 --> 02:23:16.032]  And the problem, too, is most people that are in political media, like I said, they live in D.C.
[02:23:16.052 --> 02:23:16.553]  or New York.
[02:23:16.593 --> 02:23:17.993]  We're out here in Austin, Texas.
[02:23:18.033 --> 02:23:19.134]  So they've never really met us.
[02:23:19.254 --> 02:23:20.815]  All they see is the fake news about us.
[02:23:21.235 --> 02:23:22.576]  Once they meet us, they'll get to know us.
[02:23:22.756 --> 02:23:30.420]  And by the way, and we'll talk about this now, I was just at a local bar owner, restaurant owner press conference here.
[02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:39.445]  Mayor Adler, this is the breaking news, by the way, Mayor Adler announced just a day ago, so he gives them two days notice, oh, bars and restaurants have to be closed at 1030.
[02:23:40.205 --> 02:23:45.031]  They've already purchased the food, the beverage for New Year's Eve, not expecting this to happen.
[02:23:45.151 --> 02:23:46.933]  And it's all a raw exercise of power!
[02:23:47.133 --> 02:23:48.314]  It has nothing to do with viruses!
[02:23:48.575 --> 02:23:51.258]  It's just a pure, I tell you, to stand on one leg!
[02:23:51.318 --> 02:23:52.820]  I tell you to stick your thumb up your rear end!
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:54.341]  I tell you to stand on your damn head!
[02:23:54.642 --> 02:23:57.385]  Well, they just announced- Well, Adler's flying around all over the damn Caribbean!
[02:23:57.685 --> 02:24:03.626]  Well, and we'll maybe see him tonight at the W. He's welcome to come out and be a part of our event tonight outside of the W at 11 p.m.
[02:24:04.186 --> 02:24:13.168]  But there was a moment today where there was a gentleman from the Austin American Statement there, and I was there asking the bar owners questions.
[02:24:13.208 --> 02:24:16.549]  By the way, they announced they're going to disobey the illegal order, so I mean, of course.
[02:24:16.569 --> 02:24:18.049]  Did you get some footage of that for your show tonight?
[02:24:18.109 --> 02:24:19.070]  Yes, we have the footage.
[02:24:19.130 --> 02:24:20.870]  It's being uploaded to Banned Out Video right now.
[02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:24.634]  We have the full press conference and we're going to have some highlights cut up.
[02:24:24.674 --> 02:24:25.114]  But you know what?
[02:24:25.215 --> 02:24:25.895]  Here's the thing, Alex.
[02:24:25.915 --> 02:24:33.704]  At the end of this, there was a guy from the Austin American-Statesman, who I'm sure we disagree on everything politically, and I gave him a little razzle-dazzle at the event.
[02:24:34.264 --> 02:24:38.148]  And then afterwards, he came up to me and he said, hey, you know what?
[02:24:38.589 --> 02:24:39.490]  I still respect you.
[02:24:39.890 --> 02:24:40.551]  I said, hey, you know what?
[02:24:40.611 --> 02:24:41.332]  His name was Phil.
[02:24:41.432 --> 02:24:42.973]  I shook his hand and I said, hey, Phil, you know what?
[02:24:43.414 --> 02:24:47.698]  When we talk politics and the ring goes up and we enter that arena, we go hard, man.
[02:24:47.738 --> 02:24:48.499]  We throw haymakers.
[02:24:48.539 --> 02:24:49.120]  That's what we do.
[02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:52.523]  But he needs to come in on the side of keeping the businesses open, damn it!
[02:24:52.904 --> 02:24:54.445]  Well, we should all be on the side of that, but...
[02:24:55.146 --> 02:24:56.947]  Here's the thing that we all have to realize, Alex.
[02:24:57.207 --> 02:24:58.848]  We have to share this earth together.
[02:24:59.108 --> 02:25:01.570]  We have to share this consciousness together one way or the other.
[02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:01.810]  I agree.
[02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:03.271]  The globalist one is fighting with each other.
[02:25:03.651 --> 02:25:07.533]  We need to lovingly reach out for the left because they're victims of mind control in the new year.
[02:25:08.093 --> 02:25:11.535]  And it's just being able to put the political differences aside.
[02:25:11.575 --> 02:25:12.596]  Hey, have those battles.
[02:25:12.616 --> 02:25:19.900]  We're always going to have... And even though you're jealous of my hair, you just get over it.
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.001]  Actually, I wanted to have a hair transplant here live on air.
[02:25:23.619 --> 02:25:24.780]  I want to get the Biden deal.
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:25.660]  You're jealous of my hair.
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:27.001]  Give me the Biden deal.
[02:25:27.601 --> 02:25:30.662]  Biden had his head chopped off, so why don't we just chop the top of your head off.
[02:25:31.323 --> 02:25:32.983]  But see, I have a small head, you have a big head.
[02:25:33.523 --> 02:25:35.764]  The President-elect is Kamala Harris, he said so.
[02:25:36.565 --> 02:25:38.325]  He said that I think three or four times now.
[02:25:38.746 --> 02:25:47.009]  He can't, well look Alex, let's... Whether I have your hair or my hair tonight, both of our hair is going to be... Well it's not because you're really upset you don't have mine.
[02:25:47.029 --> 02:25:50.670]  Both of our hair... You've been crying about it a lot, and I'm saying you're going to get over it in the New Year.
[02:25:50.690 --> 02:25:51.371]  Is this projection?
[02:25:52.273 --> 02:25:53.294]  It's called a joke, Owen.
[02:25:53.835 --> 02:25:54.655]  It's alright, Alex.
[02:25:55.256 --> 02:25:56.277]  We can transplant hair.
[02:25:56.297 --> 02:25:57.999]  My hair is one step away from a comb-over.
[02:25:58.279 --> 02:26:01.022]  That's why as soon as I lose 30 pounds... You need to go with the chrome dome.
[02:26:01.102 --> 02:26:02.023]  Oh, it's going off.
[02:26:02.203 --> 02:26:02.423]  Yeah.
[02:26:03.104 --> 02:26:03.704]  New Year's Eve?
[02:26:04.065 --> 02:26:04.826]  Shave your head tonight?
[02:26:04.966 --> 02:26:05.466]  I don't know.
[02:26:05.486 --> 02:26:08.990]  I don't want to look... No, you should invite Mayor Adler... I do look a little Lex Luthor with that shave.
[02:26:09.010 --> 02:26:11.092]  You should invite Mayor Adler to shave your hair tonight.
[02:26:11.332 --> 02:26:12.613]  You can shave it with a straight blade.
[02:26:13.752 --> 02:26:16.353]  He's probably in the Caribbean with no mask on with 20 hookers.
[02:26:16.994 --> 02:26:17.514]  I wonder.
[02:26:17.754 --> 02:26:21.136]  I mean, hell, it's like this other minister in Canada got caught in the Caribbean.
[02:26:21.576 --> 02:26:27.278]  I mean, it's like the main doctor says, arrest anyone not wearing a mask, and he's like in a photo with 12 chicks in bikinis kissing him.
[02:26:27.318 --> 02:26:29.920]  I mean, it's like, they know it's a lie, folks!
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:31.000]  Yeah, it's Fauci.
[02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:31.720]  It's all of them.
[02:26:32.521 --> 02:26:33.801]  Anyways, I cannot say enough.
[02:26:33.962 --> 02:26:35.182]  Everybody's got to get to D.C.
[02:26:35.222 --> 02:26:36.203]  The 5th is huge.
[02:26:36.243 --> 02:26:37.643]  The president wants it huge.
[02:26:37.683 --> 02:26:38.624]  He wants it massive.
[02:26:39.611 --> 02:26:39.991]  The 5th.
[02:26:40.312 --> 02:26:42.213]  So try to get there on the 4th or the day of the 5th.
[02:26:42.694 --> 02:26:43.514]  Freedom Plaza.
[02:26:44.055 --> 02:26:48.659]  And there was a big ridiculous stupid fight over the permits and all the rest of it, but that's all been handled.
[02:26:49.039 --> 02:26:51.401]  So our group's got the main permit and everybody's welcome to speak.
[02:26:51.982 --> 02:26:55.525]  It's going to be absolutely amazing on the 5th and the 6th.
[02:26:55.605 --> 02:26:56.606]  A lot of big surprises.
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:01.981]  There was so much infighting going on that Roger Stone was going to cancel going like last time.
[02:27:02.301 --> 02:27:02.901]  He's coming.
[02:27:03.721 --> 02:27:04.601]  I'm paying to get in there.
[02:27:04.741 --> 02:27:06.962]  That means you, the listeners, are paying to get in there because Roger's broke.
[02:27:07.322 --> 02:27:09.362]  So buy some products at infowarestore.com.
[02:27:09.642 --> 02:27:13.543]  Get your pollen block that's back in stock after eight months because the COVID lockdown couldn't get it.
[02:27:13.883 --> 02:27:14.604]  That's back in.
[02:27:14.864 --> 02:27:16.884]  We've got X2 back in, Super Bowl Vitality back in.
[02:27:17.224 --> 02:27:22.045]  All discounted 50% off on those, on the X2 and on the Super Bowl Vitality.
[02:27:22.525 --> 02:27:24.266]  And of course, we've also got the
[02:27:25.206 --> 02:27:32.031]  Winter Sun that's very close to selling out in the next few weeks at current prices, and the fluoride-free activated charcoal concentrated toothpaste.
[02:27:32.372 --> 02:27:33.953]  It is back in stock, 25% off.
[02:27:34.253 --> 02:27:38.336]  And you guys have funded this revolution, and I salute and love you and thank you.
[02:27:38.436 --> 02:27:41.378]  Owen, what else you got coming up on The War Room today?
[02:27:42.279 --> 02:27:53.005]  So, we are going to be talking about the next move for President Trump and his team, as they just had another hearing in Georgia yesterday, the hacking of the Dominion systems.
[02:27:53.185 --> 02:27:59.429]  Now there could be potential subpoenas coming forward where Dominion will have to testify, so that could be all in the future.
[02:27:59.849 --> 02:28:01.991]  President's team said they're going to have specific evidence, but...
[02:28:02.771 --> 02:28:03.712]  We're going to take a lot of calls.
[02:28:03.732 --> 02:28:06.594]  We've got Leo Zagami coming up and a couple other guests.
[02:28:07.035 --> 02:28:14.060]  But tonight, here's why I think, why I wanted to do this tonight and why the crew wanted to do this tonight.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:17.103]  Because there is no support for Mayor Adler in this town.
[02:28:17.163 --> 02:28:18.184]  I mean, there really isn't.
[02:28:18.224 --> 02:28:19.585]  We've got to start the recall.
[02:28:19.605 --> 02:28:21.967]  In fact, that's the resolution, is to recall that piece of filth.
[02:28:22.392 --> 02:28:25.954]  They had, uh, there was a lady out there taking signatures to recall Adler today.
[02:28:26.014 --> 02:28:27.155]  I invited her to be out there tonight.
[02:28:27.175 --> 02:28:29.957]  So let's have a recall Adler rally at 11 p.m.
[02:28:29.977 --> 02:28:32.138]  tonight out front the W. Absolutely.
[02:28:32.399 --> 02:28:37.962]  And hey, look, it's a peaceful protest, unofficially sponsored by Black Lives Matter and the Austin Homeless.
[02:28:38.222 --> 02:28:40.944]  So that means we can burn it down and shoot people, but we won't do that.
[02:28:41.004 --> 02:28:42.165]  No, no, no.
[02:28:42.385 --> 02:28:44.407]  We're not like the peaceful protesters that burn buildings down.
[02:28:44.627 --> 02:28:49.150]  We're the peaceful type that give people a pat on the back and we sign the signature to recall that little piece of filth.
[02:28:49.907 --> 02:28:51.709]  I think Adler should come out with us tonight.
[02:28:51.929 --> 02:28:53.871]  And by the way, we'll have, uh, it's going to be fun.
[02:28:53.891 --> 02:28:55.092]  We'll have the Tar and Feather.
[02:28:55.352 --> 02:29:01.898]  We'll have, uh, you should invite Adler to shave your chrome dome and then Tar and Feather your bald head.
[02:29:03.706 --> 02:29:05.668]  He should come out and join us though, don't you think?
[02:29:06.208 --> 02:29:08.910]  We toasted, you and I toasted to freedom in July this year.
[02:29:09.291 --> 02:29:11.052]  And so now we're going to toast to bringing the New Years.
[02:29:11.112 --> 02:29:15.495]  It's 11pm out front of the W. The reason why we're at the W, if people are wondering, that's where Adler lives.
[02:29:15.615 --> 02:29:20.799]  He lives in the penthouse of the W. I don't know how he affords that on his meager mayoral salary.
[02:29:20.819 --> 02:29:22.180]  The guy is owned by Big Tech.
[02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:24.542]  It's got everything locked down with Big Tech.
[02:29:24.902 --> 02:29:27.344]  He's a globalist operative trying to shut our city down.
[02:29:27.504 --> 02:29:28.645]  He's an enemy of America.
[02:29:30.208 --> 02:29:32.430]  Mayor Adler, I don't want to have to do this to you tonight.
[02:29:32.470 --> 02:29:33.611]  We've met many times.
[02:29:33.751 --> 02:29:35.433]  You usually run away when you see me now.
[02:29:35.473 --> 02:29:37.535]  But come out tonight, be a part of this.
[02:29:37.595 --> 02:29:38.736]  You're an American too.
[02:29:39.096 --> 02:29:39.937]  We'll toast to you.
[02:29:39.957 --> 02:29:43.840]  We'll cordially come together even though we're bitter political rivals.
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:45.261]  And you're going to love the tar bath.
[02:29:45.982 --> 02:29:46.643]  Feels so good.
[02:29:46.663 --> 02:29:49.265]  For Alex's bald head and that you can enjoy.
[02:29:49.305 --> 02:29:50.966]  Oh, I'll be tarred and feathered by Adler.
[02:29:50.986 --> 02:29:57.472]  No, no, no, Jed, he's going to shave your head and then he's going to put the tar and feather on your bald head so that you have a new head of hair like Biden, or like a founding father.
[02:29:57.672 --> 02:29:59.634]  I'll be like, Bird Man!
[02:30:00.094 --> 02:30:02.576]  Or Adler can be a coward and a fraud and hide.
[02:30:02.596 --> 02:30:04.858]  Hey, it's the last few seconds of the Alex Jones Show 2020.
[02:30:04.938 --> 02:30:08.301]  We got... And I made it, I was on air!
[02:30:08.421 --> 02:30:10.803]  The great Matt Bracken's coming up, coming up.
[02:30:11.484 --> 02:30:13.966]  Alright, it's the last show of the year.
[02:30:14.898 --> 02:30:20.802]  And I'm very proud and honored to be called in to close it out for you.
[02:30:22.023 --> 02:30:26.346]  You know, I'm wearing an InfoWars shirt right there today.
[02:30:26.366 --> 02:30:34.392]  I'm not a member of the InfoWars team in any kind of a financial sense.
[02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:36.193]  Never been paid.
[02:30:36.694 --> 02:30:38.295]  I'm doing this from my home in Florida.
[02:30:39.376 --> 02:30:40.977]  But I'm wearing it because
[02:30:41.869 --> 02:30:45.090]  I'm proud to stand with Alex and the Infowars family.
[02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:52.291]  We're going into a new year and, you know, we're going to do this, stop the steel rally next week, and we don't know how it's going to turn out.
[02:30:53.032 --> 02:31:00.013]  But there's a real serious chance that Biden and Harris are going to be the president and vice president.
[02:31:01.073 --> 02:31:07.815]  Obama will be a, excuse me, a mile or so away in his, the basement of his Washington mansion.
[02:31:08.587 --> 02:31:12.809]  Feeding their scripts to them, as he has said on TV.
[02:31:12.829 --> 02:31:17.072]  He'll be happy to just be the guy putting the words into the earpieces.
[02:31:18.493 --> 02:31:19.573]  So we know what's coming.
[02:31:20.354 --> 02:31:24.496]  The Department of Justice is going to be run by people like Andrew Weissman.
[02:31:25.256 --> 02:31:28.058]  And it's going to be a very dangerous time for patriots.
[02:31:28.738 --> 02:31:30.879]  Because they're going to be out for revenge.
[02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:32.941]  Very serious revenge.
[02:31:33.941 --> 02:31:37.163]  Anybody that thinks that this is a joke, let me tell you.
[02:31:38.098 --> 02:31:47.443]  All of the hassles that we've had with the FBI and the DOJ being in a virtual state of mutiny the last four years, that was with our guy in the White House.
[02:31:48.403 --> 02:32:00.069]  So you put Obama as the puppet master and others like him feeding the lines to Harris and Biden, picking his attorney general.
[02:32:01.490 --> 02:32:04.271]  The Department of Justice is going to be out for scalps.
[02:32:04.915 --> 02:32:14.604]  What happened to Roger Stone is going to be magnified many fold, and there won't be a pardon waiting at the end of the Biden-Harris administration.
[02:32:15.264 --> 02:32:16.445]  It'll just be prison.
[02:32:17.126 --> 02:32:26.835]  So, anybody that snipes at Alex and wants to cut him down, I'm telling you, who goes to the rallies?
[02:32:27.355 --> 02:32:28.636]  Who gets right out in front?
[02:32:29.817 --> 02:32:30.318]  Excuse me.
[02:32:31.789 --> 02:32:35.010]  Who's fearless when it comes to putting his face right out in front?
[02:32:35.710 --> 02:32:45.292]  You know, the former head of the NSA, General Michael Hayden, said he wants to see Alex charged and put in prison.
[02:32:45.993 --> 02:32:47.033]  They're not kidding, folks.
[02:32:47.653 --> 02:32:48.933]  This is serious business.
[02:32:49.914 --> 02:32:57.215]  Anybody that thinks that this is all like some kind of a grift or a big for-profit deal, I've never been paid a dime.
[02:32:57.595 --> 02:32:59.476]  I'm doing this for the love of it.
[02:32:59.963 --> 02:33:02.224]  For the patriotism, for the love of my country.
[02:33:02.684 --> 02:33:03.144]  That's it.
[02:33:04.264 --> 02:33:12.407]  I'm going to Washington next week, and I hope it's such a big rally that it's impossible to find anybody, that it'll be a sea of people.
[02:33:12.467 --> 02:33:13.187]  That's my hope.
[02:33:13.727 --> 02:33:14.627]  That's my goal.
[02:33:15.327 --> 02:33:27.931]  But to all of the anonymous ankle biters that want to hack away at Alex, let me tell you, the man has been a fearless leader now for many years.
[02:33:28.627 --> 02:33:30.568]  And he hasn't quit when it would have been easy.
[02:33:31.008 --> 02:33:36.331]  It would have been so easy at various points in the last couple of years to say, you know what, I've had it.
[02:33:37.532 --> 02:33:39.453]  I'm just going to, I've done my part.
[02:33:39.953 --> 02:33:41.194]  I've done more than my part.
[02:33:41.274 --> 02:33:44.196]  I'm going to exit stage left and just live a quiet life.
[02:33:44.796 --> 02:33:45.497]  He didn't do it.
[02:33:46.017 --> 02:33:48.578]  Just like Donald Trump didn't do it.
[02:33:48.618 --> 02:33:53.421]  Trump could just, just say, look, the odds of my winning this are slim and none.
[02:33:54.099 --> 02:33:59.282]  So I'm just going to concede, you know, this way it'll put my family out of the line of fire.
[02:33:59.822 --> 02:34:09.908]  Because you know that after the, you know, if, if, uh, if Biden is in the White House next year, they're going to come after the entire Trump family.
[02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:17.433]  They're going to do what due to, um, everybody with a, with Trump in their name, what they did to Roger Stone.
[02:34:18.173 --> 02:34:19.494]  And you know, they're going to do it.
[02:34:19.874 --> 02:34:20.935]  They're going to do it hard.
[02:34:21.573 --> 02:34:24.554]  And that's why it's time to really stand up and be counted.
[02:34:25.094 --> 02:34:26.635]  That's why I'm going to Washington.
[02:34:27.175 --> 02:34:28.836]  That's why I do this show.
[02:34:29.516 --> 02:34:33.837]  Because we all are going to hang together or we're going to hang separately.
[02:34:34.398 --> 02:34:38.359]  And the more of us that there are, the more power that we're going to get.
[02:34:38.379 --> 02:34:46.102]  You know, this Great Reset that we've all been talking about for years, it's really about control.
[02:34:46.122 --> 02:34:49.883]  The global elites are now cooperating
[02:34:50.638 --> 02:34:57.801]  Are trying to get us to be basically subservient peasants in a total control grid matrix.
[02:34:58.521 --> 02:34:59.762]  And they're very close.
[02:35:00.762 --> 02:35:06.564]  They've been using China as the test bed because there's no Bill of Rights, obviously, in China.
[02:35:07.265 --> 02:35:11.346]  But they're working out all of the technology and all the methodologies in China.
[02:35:11.906 --> 02:35:15.648]  But they're, step by step, going to be using it here in this country.
[02:35:16.525 --> 02:35:20.489]  You're not going to be able to do a lot of things without the vaccine very soon.
[02:35:21.650 --> 02:35:31.058]  First, everybody is trying to get the vaccine, but in a short while, it's going to be, who are the refuseniks that won't take the vaccine?
[02:35:31.718 --> 02:35:36.502]  And they're going to be locked out professionally and locked out of travel.
[02:35:37.063 --> 02:35:38.784]  This is all about control.
[02:35:39.505 --> 02:35:42.688]  So next week, on January 5th and 6th,
[02:35:43.737 --> 02:35:46.918]  What we have to do is show who's really in control.
[02:35:47.658 --> 02:35:49.879]  We don't control social media.
[02:35:50.199 --> 02:35:53.020]  We don't have all of these organs of power.
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:55.740]  We don't control the Department of Justice.
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:36:02.762]  We can't decide what criminals will go uncharged and what innocent people will be arrested in the middle of the night.
[02:36:03.183 --> 02:36:04.223]  We don't control that.
[02:36:04.963 --> 02:36:07.644]  But we can overwhelm them with sheer numbers.
[02:36:08.524 --> 02:36:11.865]  And that's why it's going to be our week next week.
[02:36:12.748 --> 02:36:15.310]  You know, we weren't around for Valley Forge.
[02:36:15.370 --> 02:36:19.593]  We weren't around, you know, during any of America's darkest days.
[02:36:20.514 --> 02:36:22.035]  And now we're so comfortable.
[02:36:22.135 --> 02:36:28.920]  It's so easy to sit on the couch, watch the TV, change channels, hit the refrigerator.
[02:36:28.940 --> 02:36:30.641]  There's no problem.
[02:36:30.701 --> 02:36:38.667]  You can just watch your country go down the toilet, watch our elections be stolen, watch our freedom being lost.
[02:36:39.568 --> 02:36:40.969]  Or you can actually rally.
[02:36:41.499 --> 02:36:50.266]  Now, next week, it's not going to be a quick in-and-out like some rallies are, you know, with convenient shuttle buses.
[02:36:50.686 --> 02:36:52.708]  This is going to be a lot of confusion.
[02:36:52.728 --> 02:36:57.111]  I've been told they're not going to put out porta-potties.
[02:36:58.352 --> 02:36:58.952]  The D.C.
[02:36:58.992 --> 02:37:03.676]  government is going to do everything that they can to sabotage and hassle this.
[02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:11.762]  So if you go to Washington, you can't plan on just getting a hotel room anywhere in Maryland or Virginia, convenient.
[02:37:12.402 --> 02:37:15.523]  You're going to have to go almost with a camping trip mentality.
[02:37:16.443 --> 02:37:23.725]  And the weather should be fairly decent, the long-range forecast isn't too cold, no front coming through, but you can't tell at this point.
[02:37:24.335 --> 02:37:31.762]  But you're going to have to go with your own plan for food, for water, and for all of the bodily functions.
[02:37:31.822 --> 02:37:41.751]  Because if you are in a mob of 500,000 or a million people, you're not going to be able to just look at your map and say, oh, now I'm going to walk down this street.
[02:37:42.192 --> 02:37:44.994]  You're going to be like a fish in the middle of a giant school.
[02:37:45.535 --> 02:37:48.938]  You're going to go where the school pushes you at some points.
[02:37:49.767 --> 02:37:58.634]  So, you know, unless you get there very early, like on the 4th or 5th, and stake out a spot, you know, you may not even get within sight of the Capitol.
[02:37:59.414 --> 02:38:00.335]  But that's alright.
[02:38:00.975 --> 02:38:01.916]  Even if the D.C.
[02:38:01.996 --> 02:38:15.406]  police pull tricks like stopping the Metro from running, or searching people going on the Metro to hassle them and confiscate signs, things like that, you know, there are other methods that can be done.
[02:38:16.783 --> 02:38:19.764]  Giant car caravans can just circle the D.C.
[02:38:19.824 --> 02:38:20.324]  Beltway.
[02:38:20.945 --> 02:38:30.028]  You get enough enough Trumpsters, enough Stop the Steal ralliers to park on the bridges, you can bring Washington, D.C.
[02:38:30.068 --> 02:38:31.168]  to a complete stop.
[02:38:31.668 --> 02:38:40.271]  If they try to prevent this peaceful assembly by keeping people away from the Capitol, then the people are just going to do other things.
[02:38:41.052 --> 02:38:44.293]  And on the other side of this break, we're going to talk some more about that.
[02:38:45.131 --> 02:38:48.934]  You know, this, I can't emphasize, this is our moment.
[02:38:49.574 --> 02:38:54.758]  You know, we have never been tested in our lives like we are about to be tested.
[02:38:55.158 --> 02:38:58.681]  We haven't fought a war on American soil since 1865.
[02:38:59.621 --> 02:39:02.343]  You know, we have been blessed.
[02:39:02.464 --> 02:39:06.787]  Our wars have been fought overseas, in other people's territory.
[02:39:07.607 --> 02:39:09.709]  And we have to get off the couches
[02:39:10.549 --> 02:39:23.693]  Break away out of our free, out of our, you know, peaceful, easy living and show that this country is not going to be stolen by these Democrats, Socialists, Communists, Globalists.
[02:39:24.233 --> 02:39:25.834]  We're just not going to permit it.
[02:39:26.374 --> 02:39:28.555]  And next week is when we're going to show it.
[02:39:29.175 --> 02:39:36.137]  You know, it's, it's, um, it's been pretty hard for me to think about anything except this election from November 3rd when
[02:39:37.062 --> 02:39:43.803]  Trump was ahead by hundreds of thousands of votes in these six key states we've been talking about now for almost two months.
[02:39:45.183 --> 02:39:51.525]  And we woke up and lo and behold, the Democrats had pulled off their Operation Red Mirage.
[02:39:52.225 --> 02:39:56.445]  They had flooded the ballot boxes with their fake ballots.
[02:39:57.306 --> 02:39:59.966]  And yeah, I absolutely now say fake ballots.
[02:40:00.826 --> 02:40:05.167]  I don't know how many of you were able to watch the Georgia Senate hearing yesterday.
[02:40:06.278 --> 02:40:09.680]  And I watched it all, and it had some amazing testimony.
[02:40:10.561 --> 02:40:14.143]  Some from technical and engineering experts.
[02:40:15.344 --> 02:40:21.868]  There's no question that tens of thousands of ballots in these states were counterfeit.
[02:40:22.729 --> 02:40:25.531]  They were mass produced ahead of time.
[02:40:26.311 --> 02:40:34.056]  When you look at some of these guys, like this witness on the screen right now, Jovan Pulitzer, he's got 200 patents.
[02:40:35.498 --> 02:40:41.539]  You know, involved with the human-machine interface, like QR codes.
[02:40:41.619 --> 02:40:45.220]  He's an expert on this and he says all he needs to see is the paper ballots.
[02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:48.121]  You can't fake the creases.
[02:40:48.161 --> 02:40:49.581]  You can't fake the dots.
[02:40:50.161 --> 02:40:51.421]  You can't fake the names.
[02:40:52.361 --> 02:40:57.082]  If they can show the paper ballots, it's obviously going to be shown a fraud.
[02:40:57.703 --> 02:40:59.523]  So why are they hiding the paper ballots?
[02:40:59.543 --> 02:41:02.544]  They're hiding the paper ballots because they are hiding the fraud.
[02:41:03.564 --> 02:41:04.504]  Another expert,
[02:41:05.123 --> 02:41:10.487]  Who is named Bobby Piton or Python, P-I-T-O-N.
[02:41:11.608 --> 02:41:15.792]  He's done a very fascinating mathematical analysis of the names.
[02:41:16.813 --> 02:41:29.163]  And in Pennsylvania and Georgia, among other states, there are hundreds of thousands of names of people that essentially what it boils down to is they have no relatives.
[02:41:29.663 --> 02:41:31.945]  They're like a celestial alien
[02:41:32.912 --> 02:41:37.574]  You know, dropped onto the planet Earth for the purpose of voting and then disappearing.
[02:41:38.314 --> 02:41:42.916]  They have unique first and last names that don't have any relatives.
[02:41:43.016 --> 02:41:46.017]  They had no mother, father, sister, brother, nephew.
[02:41:46.037 --> 02:41:54.420]  You know, this is so easy to look into if we had an honest media, if we had an honest Department of Justice.
[02:41:55.141 --> 02:41:56.961]  This would be so easy to crack.
[02:41:57.361 --> 02:42:01.063]  So we're watching this theft in front of our faces in real time.
[02:42:01.653 --> 02:42:07.294]  We're watching it, and we're just going to sit on the couch and say, well, what can I do about it?
[02:42:08.154 --> 02:42:15.316]  Well, let me tell you, the path of least resistance is just to flow down the river like a cork.
[02:42:16.056 --> 02:42:30.779]  Or another way of looking at it, the path of least resistance is to stay in the herd of sheep that are following a Judas goat up at the front through the ever-narrowing plank board fences on each side
[02:42:31.411 --> 02:42:35.134]  Formed into a V, and at the end is the slaughterhouse.
[02:42:35.855 --> 02:42:42.641]  Because there's no doubt, what is in store for us, we are being set up for slavery.
[02:42:43.322 --> 02:42:55.113]  If we let this stand, if we let an election be stolen from us, while our elite political bosses and media bosses say, don't believe your lying eyes,
[02:42:55.888 --> 02:43:05.596]  Those ballots being pulled out from underneath the tables that were hidden, you know, hidden with black tablecloths, that doesn't mean anything.
[02:43:05.956 --> 02:43:22.909]  When you see those women putting those stacks of ballots through three and four times, something like 150,000 Biden votes in a spike in the middle of the night in Georgia after they said, oh, we have to clear the room for a burst water main.
[02:43:23.871 --> 02:43:28.252]  Folks, if you let this happen, then it's on you.
[02:43:28.272 --> 02:43:34.054]  Then future generations will say, you just didn't really give a damn.
[02:43:34.754 --> 02:43:38.275]  They stole the election, not even hiding it.
[02:43:39.176 --> 02:43:42.157]  Hundreds of thousands of fake names.
[02:43:42.417 --> 02:43:44.137]  People that don't exist.
[02:43:45.338 --> 02:43:48.258]  Counterfeit ballots with no creases.
[02:43:49.499 --> 02:43:50.759]  Dead people voting.
[02:43:51.359 --> 02:43:52.860]  Illegal aliens voting.
[02:43:53.542 --> 02:44:02.287]  And none of your political bosses are giving you the courtesy, or very few, of even saying, yeah, what you see with your own two eyes is true.
[02:44:02.707 --> 02:44:06.789]  The elite class just wants the party to continue.
[02:44:06.809 --> 02:44:18.036]  The Republicans just want to go back to being the Washington generals, the happy basketball team that always loses to the Harlem Globetrotters.
[02:44:19.356 --> 02:44:22.118]  From day one, Trump has been up against
[02:44:22.919 --> 02:44:27.082]  All of the Democrats and at least half of the Republicans.
[02:44:27.603 --> 02:44:28.884]  Look at Mitch McConnell.
[02:44:29.424 --> 02:44:38.211]  If he was a patriot and not a Chai Com sellout, look at his wife's family, the billions that they make from China.
[02:44:38.892 --> 02:44:43.735]  If he wasn't a Chai Com sellout, he could stop this right now.
[02:44:44.216 --> 02:44:49.300]  Instead of making a deal with Nancy Pelosi to put the knife in Trump's back,
[02:44:50.057 --> 02:44:53.719]  And put Biden, the election thief, in the White House.
[02:44:54.519 --> 02:45:04.763]  He could put an end to this just by promoting the challenges to these false certified results in these swing states.
[02:45:05.604 --> 02:45:06.904]  But he's not doing it.
[02:45:07.524 --> 02:45:08.625]  And he's not alone.
[02:45:09.679 --> 02:45:13.260]  Half of the Republicans are as bad as the Democrats.
[02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:35.409]  In fact, I think I hate them more because I respect an honest enemy like a Chuck Schumer standing in front of me as a communist saying he hates me more than a Republican that says, sure, I'm a conservative, but he's making secret deals with Pelosi and Schumer to get ready to put the knife in our back.
[02:45:36.470 --> 02:45:39.371]  Folks, next week, we have a chance
[02:45:40.031 --> 02:45:42.212]  To change the course of history.
[02:45:42.853 --> 02:45:48.797]  It's not going to be done by Senator Hawley by himself.
[02:45:49.317 --> 02:45:58.223]  We can't wait for some, you know, white hat QAnon secret, you know, insiders going to fix it for us.
[02:45:58.263 --> 02:45:59.664]  That's not going to happen.
[02:45:59.884 --> 02:46:01.585]  All of that has been BS.
[02:46:02.265 --> 02:46:07.849]  That's been meant to keep the sheep going in line to the slaughterhouse, nice and calm.
[02:46:08.652 --> 02:46:13.816]  Believing in some deus ex machina that was going to pull a rabbit out of the hat and save us.
[02:46:15.517 --> 02:46:18.199]  We're not going to be saved by anybody above us.
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:31.869]  We're going to only be saved by millions of Americans moving to Washington, occupying the entire area, if necessary, storming right into the Capitol.
[02:46:31.889 --> 02:46:33.791]  We know the rules of engagement.
[02:46:35.902 --> 02:46:41.305]  If you have enough people, you can push down any kind of a fence or a wall.
[02:46:42.185 --> 02:46:49.009]  But if not enough patriots show up, then we're just going to watch our freedom go down the drain.
[02:46:50.009 --> 02:46:57.313]  If anybody thinks, and I hope on this show they don't think it, don't worry, in two years we'll win, we'll get them back.
[02:46:58.034 --> 02:47:00.055]  That's what they thought in Venezuela.
[02:47:00.455 --> 02:47:02.496]  Don't worry about this Hugo Chavez.
[02:47:03.174 --> 02:47:07.416]  He'll wreck the economy, and then the conservatives will win the next election.
[02:47:07.896 --> 02:47:08.496]  No, folks.
[02:47:09.217 --> 02:47:28.145]  If they can steal an election right in front of our face, on video, with, you know, hundreds of thousands of fake ballots, counterfeit ballots, fake names of people that don't exist, and we can't stop it, do you really think we'll ever have another free election in this country?
[02:47:29.212 --> 02:47:33.657]  Do you think they'll give us a chance to come back in two years and push the Democrats out?
[02:47:35.279 --> 02:47:38.162]  Next week is a pivot in American history.
[02:47:38.762 --> 02:47:50.335]  Next week, we are going to stand up as free Americans, or we are just going to cringe back to our sofa, watch our country turn into a Marizuela,
[02:47:51.039 --> 02:48:00.109]  Lose our freedom, and remember, our country in this scenario is just one big cog in the global Great Reset.
[02:48:00.669 --> 02:48:07.877]  We're going to be nothing more than peasant slaves in a Chinese-style social credit system
[02:48:08.570 --> 02:48:24.936]  Where you just have to say yes or no, sir, because you're afraid that if you go to the wrong websites, you're going to get marked down on your social credit, which will affect everything from your credit score to your ability to travel, just like in China.
[02:48:25.396 --> 02:48:27.617]  That's what our elites have planned for us.
[02:48:28.517 --> 02:48:35.340]  And the only chance we have to stop this is a mass mobilization next week.
[02:48:36.323 --> 02:48:42.205]  If we don't see a million people in Washington, then I'll know.
[02:48:42.505 --> 02:48:44.526]  Just not enough Americans cared.
[02:48:45.086 --> 02:48:47.027]  Freedom just didn't matter that much.
[02:48:47.787 --> 02:48:55.789]  As long as they had Netflix, and a full refrigerator, and a cozy sofa, they really didn't give a damn about freedom.
[02:48:55.889 --> 02:49:00.371]  And if that's the case, then we deserve everything that comes after this.
[02:49:01.198 --> 02:49:04.380]  Because we will then just be saying, I'm a sheep.
[02:49:04.721 --> 02:49:06.382]  I follow the sheep in front of me.
[02:49:06.862 --> 02:49:09.784]  The loudspeakers are saying everything is normal.
[02:49:10.164 --> 02:49:13.027]  Follow that goat towards the big building up ahead.
[02:49:13.047 --> 02:49:15.108]  I'm not doing it.
[02:49:15.748 --> 02:49:16.949]  I'm going to Washington.
[02:49:17.370 --> 02:49:18.851]  I'm staying for the duration.
[02:49:19.031 --> 02:49:21.913]  If there are debates, I'm staying till the end.
[02:49:22.925 --> 02:49:23.426]  I don't care.
[02:49:23.446 --> 02:49:28.351]  I've heard all about the hotel situation and Antifa and Black Lives Matter.
[02:49:28.811 --> 02:49:29.372]  I don't care.
[02:49:29.452 --> 02:49:30.013]  I'm going.
[02:49:30.553 --> 02:49:31.694]  And I hope I see you there.
[02:49:31.714 --> 02:49:33.376]  I hope I see millions of you there.
[02:49:34.117 --> 02:49:36.800]  And I hope I see you again on InfoWars.
[02:49:37.781 --> 02:49:38.661]  Thanks for listening.
[02:49:39.963 --> 02:49:40.744]  Happy New Year.
[02:49:42.886 --> 02:49:43.607]  The year 2021 is now here.
[02:49:46.414 --> 02:49:46.594]  I think?
[02:50:10.182 --> 02:50:15.768]  Where those of us who understand what's happening are able to congregate, share information, and move against their operation.
[02:50:16.388 --> 02:50:18.931]  Their plan is very diabolical and over-the-top evil.
[02:50:19.331 --> 02:50:24.617]  But if people are simply informed about it and resist it, it can and will and really must be defeated.
[02:50:25.865 --> 02:50:29.566]  Now in that fight, we fund ourselves by selling products directly to the public.
[02:50:29.586 --> 02:50:34.407]  Because as you know, the globalists shut down and boycott all of their opposition.
[02:50:34.727 --> 02:50:37.547]  But we've built the model of resistance that can take them down.
[02:50:37.947 --> 02:50:41.488]  Because you are supporting us in buying products directly from Infowars.
[02:50:42.368 --> 02:50:43.589]  Now I've gotten a lot of complaints.
[02:50:43.989 --> 02:50:49.430]  Thousands of them saying in the last 8 months or so, a lot of our favorite products are unavailable.
[02:50:49.550 --> 02:50:49.770]  Why?
[02:50:51.018 --> 02:50:53.260]  That's because of the COVID lockdown, not COVID.
[02:50:53.980 --> 02:50:57.643]  Many of the proprietary patented ingredients in our products were unavailable.
[02:50:57.683 --> 02:50:59.524]  Warehouses were shut down, factories were shut down.
[02:50:59.845 --> 02:51:08.611]  And so for eight months, one of our most popular products, Pollen Block, to deal with seasonal irritations and the rest of it, is back in stock.
[02:51:09.191 --> 02:51:12.194]  And so is activated charcoal toothpaste.
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:15.520]  Both of these are in our Top 10 Best Sellers.
[02:51:16.021 --> 02:51:16.961]  They've been unavailable.
[02:51:17.361 --> 02:51:18.481]  This one for about 4 months.
[02:51:19.201 --> 02:51:21.642]  Pollen Block for, again, 8 plus months.
[02:51:22.082 --> 02:51:25.062]  And we only got a quarter of the shipment that we tried to get.
[02:51:25.682 --> 02:51:27.203]  Because, again, things are breaking down.
[02:51:27.223 --> 02:51:28.603]  It's proprietary products.
[02:51:28.643 --> 02:51:29.503]  Look into Pollen Block.
[02:51:29.523 --> 02:51:30.423]  Why it's so special.
[02:51:30.683 --> 02:51:31.563]  Why it's so amazing.
[02:51:31.963 --> 02:51:38.505]  And check out our Concentrated Activated Charcoal Toothpaste as well that my dad, a dentist, designed at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:51:38.785 --> 02:51:40.545]  Get yours today and thank you all for your support.
