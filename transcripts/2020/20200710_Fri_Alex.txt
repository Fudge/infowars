[00:00:00.896 --> 00:00:03.176]  Victimizers, beware!
[00:00:03.176 --> 00:00:06.117]  The racist and biggest, greatest nightmare!
[00:00:06.117 --> 00:00:08.897]  Social Justice Warriors!
[00:00:08.897 --> 00:00:10.738]  Get Triggered!
[00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:12.978]  It's the Bias Response Team!
[00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:15.739]  If you've been offended, your feelings must be defended!
[00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:16.979]  What do you want me?
[00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:18.459]  Go!
[00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:22.300]  The freedom of expression is a microaggression!
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.320]  Here comes Angela Frey!
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.741]  He's always ready to fight fascism!
[00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:27.601]  With fascism!
[00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:31.288]  Starbucks windows don't stand a chance!
[00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:33.309]  Ethic enhancer!
[00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.711]  He's a systematic racism finder!
[00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:45.378]  Using the powers of screaming and shame, they win every debate by calling your name!
[00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:48.360]  They're heroes who think that they're victims!
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.404]  Black and Justice Warriors!
[00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:02.805]  It's July 10th on this live Friday transmission.
[00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:04.486]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:07.288]  We're 115 days out from the election.
[00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:22.656]  Out of all these stacks of incredibly important news, this article is a continuation of what Foreign Affairs of the CFR put out a few weeks ago, and of what Joe Biden has been saying.
[00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:24.677]  In fact, reprint me these, please.
[00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:42.212]  That Trump is a dictator already, illegitimate, and he's going to try to stay in office, and that anyone that aids him when they announce that he loses the election will be removed forcibly and will be put in prison.
[00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:47.474]  Now, this is coming out of the Council on Foreign Relations and out of the Atlantic Council.
[00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:53.085]  And now it's in the Stanford Advocate newspaper.
[00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:56.927]  They are beating this drum long and hard.
[00:01:56.927 --> 00:01:59.529]  Now, Goldman Sachs came out two days ago.
[00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:01.730]  In fact, pull that from the stack if you can.
[00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.394]  And they said, well, there's a good chance the election is going to be contested like in 2000.
[00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:16.440]  But this time, if the Republican contested, they're saying we're going to use the military to come in and take you all out.
[00:02:17.557 --> 00:02:24.142]  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get the Biden clips where he said a month ago, we'll use the military to take Trump out.
[00:02:24.142 --> 00:02:36.212]  And I'm going to get the foreign affairs CFR statements, the Atlantic Council statements, and some of the other preparations and the signals we're getting from the US military brass that they're not going to support
[00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.710]  President.
[00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:46.776]  Now the general military will, but the actual brash have all been selected by the establishment through the years to be absolute sellouts.
[00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:50.439]  These four-star generals are just almost all of them to complete trash.
[00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:56.063]  And I was warned about this by one-star generals and colonels and majors and stuff 30 years ago.
[00:02:56.063 --> 00:02:57.684]  Don't put your faith in the military.
[00:02:57.684 --> 00:02:59.965]  They've selected really bad people at the top.
[00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:00.826]  Here's the new headline.
[00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:09.989]  Trump could lose and not leave, but cabinet members who try to help face prison.
[00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:20.114]  So they're going to say 25th Amendment, if Trump challenges any of the mail-in ballots or any fraud, and there's any fighting that goes on that's totally constitutional, then he'll be removed.
[00:03:20.114 --> 00:03:23.876]  So that's what they're trying to set up.
[00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:26.477]  And they want the economy so bad and riots going on,
[00:03:28.286 --> 00:03:31.968]  All because of the COVID hoax that they can point at Trump and say it's his fault.
[00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:34.790]  Remember what Bill Maher said on HBO?
[00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.234]  Remember what the Democrats said on CNN, MSNBC before the COVID thing got launched in November?
[00:03:41.234 --> 00:03:44.076]  We heard about it by January.
[00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:56.483]  We got to make things so bad and then harass Trump supporters so much and ruin their lives so bad and create a depression, a stock market crash that's worth it to drive Trump from office so the globalists get back in control.
[00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:05.177]  They're launching what they were always planning to launch when Hillary got in too, but they're just accelerating it.
[00:04:05.177 --> 00:04:06.858]  And I think we've done a great job.
[00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:08.860]  This is really blowing up in their face.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.063]  They can't help themselves.
[00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:17.467]  And so now you've got all these tyrants saying, purge Trump supporters, imprison us.
[00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:23.412]  Hey, this isn't Russia or China where one half a percent are armed, dumbass.
[00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:28.115]  You're not going to have your Bolshevik way with us just so easily.
[00:04:28.115 --> 00:04:33.843]  So you better pray to your mommy every night and day that you're not successful in starting a hot war.
[00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:41.212]  Because you start it, you're globalists aren't going to be able to hide out in some armored redoubt in Kauai or in Tasmania.
[00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.494]  Or in the bush of Australia, or in New Zealand, or in Switzerland.
[00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.236]  Everyone knows where you are.
[00:04:48.236 --> 00:04:51.039]  So I would advise you to stop now.
[00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.962]  But people like Hitler and people like you never stop.
[00:04:53.962 --> 00:04:56.105]  Not until you're in a bunker.
[00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:57.747]  We crawl in there and get your ass.
[00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:05.255]  The July 4th Mega Sale ends on July 12th.
[00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:06.716]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:05:06.716 --> 00:05:07.937]  Double Patriot Points.
[00:05:07.937 --> 00:05:18.166]  50 to 60% off all these best-selling items, including a bunch that have been sold out for months and are back in limited supply, like Winner, some of vitamin D3 and vitamin K for your immune system.
[00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:19.648]  Sold out, back in stock.
[00:05:19.648 --> 00:05:20.769]  Ultra 12, I call it B12.
[00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:22.770]  50% off, sold out for months.
[00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.954]  Bodies, the best-seller, ultimate tumeric formula, concentrated tumeric, back in stock.
[00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:28.916]  We're good to go.
[00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:31.622]  115 planet rotations until we are in the middle of what will be a giant contested election, the cherry on top, the detonator to take this country into hot civil war.
[00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:39.825]  Inside the Pentagon, everyone is being approached and being asked, will you support a coup
[00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:44.118]  Against President Trump.
[00:06:44.118 --> 00:06:58.387]  That even came out three years ago that a former top Obama official from the Pentagon, that's the headline, former Obama official canvassing the Pentagon on whether they will support a coup against Trump.
[00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:08.033]  That was back when they were trying to block his electors from seating him on January 20th, 2017 as the 45th President of the United States of America.
[00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:16.519]  Well now I have the Council on Foreign Relations, America's Democratic Unraveling.
[00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:22.426]  On page 50, on page 5 it says, the armed forces will be needed to remove Trump.
[00:07:23.373 --> 00:07:26.954]  That if he contests the election in any way, he will be removed by the U.S.
[00:07:26.954 --> 00:07:27.814]  military.
[00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.554]  Here's a new one out of the Stanford Advocate.
[00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:34.695]  Anyone saying that he will not leave will be arrested.
[00:07:34.695 --> 00:07:40.576]  Trump could lose and not leave, but cabinet members would try to help face prison.
[00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:44.157]  And what did Goldman Sachs say yesterday?
[00:07:44.157 --> 00:07:52.618]  They said it will be contested, they believe, because of all of the mail-in ballots and all the craziness and the court's ruling that they're going to let states
[00:07:55.663 --> 00:07:59.444]  Count the popular vote and then not send forward their delegates.
[00:07:59.444 --> 00:08:03.666]  This is going to turn into a giant court battle by design.
[00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:06.887]  Just like the Democrats did with Russiagate, Ukrainegate, and the rest of it.
[00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:08.568]  That's their admitted plan.
[00:08:08.568 --> 00:08:14.009]  They're not going to accept the results of the election.
[00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:20.792]  And they're letting Trump know, you don't go, we're going to arrest you and we're going to arrest your cabinet members.
[00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:26.336]  And I told you this was going on before it was ever in the news.
[00:08:26.336 --> 00:08:31.382]  I talked to a member of Congress and I talked to a member of the U.S.
[00:08:31.382 --> 00:08:35.867]  Senate.
[00:08:35.867 --> 00:08:42.615]  And they told us that Nancy Pelosi's daughter was quarterbacking on the Hill a plan to use the military to take Trump out.
[00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:48.101]  I went on air and I talked about that.
[00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:52.224]  And I said she's trying to get the electors to not seat him.
[00:08:52.224 --> 00:08:54.786]  I said that two weeks before it came out in the news.
[00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:59.350]  And she went on Fox News two weeks later and said, Alex Jones threatened to kill me.
[00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.191]  He needs to be arrested.
[00:09:01.191 --> 00:09:11.179]  And the Justice Department, later it came out, opened up a criminal investigation off of her total lie that I said harm against her.
[00:09:16.687 --> 00:09:17.748]  I said nothing even near that.
[00:09:17.748 --> 00:09:19.349]  I said she's engaged in treason.
[00:09:19.349 --> 00:09:20.650]  She's a treacherous rat.
[00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.051]  She's a piece of garbage.
[00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:23.131]  This is insane.
[00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.013]  They're trying to overthrow the election.
[00:09:25.013 --> 00:09:39.682]  And this ongoing coup that never got punished for the four coup attempts against the president and our election in 2016 aren't going to give up in 115 days.
[00:09:39.682 --> 00:09:43.425]  So everybody better understand, you better strap yourselves in because
[00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:59.614]  Biden has run around on TV three times, and we'll play these clips coming up in the last segment of this hour, three times, and said the military is going to remove the president when he contests the election.
[00:09:59.614 --> 00:10:02.835]  And then Goldman Sachs says it will be contested.
[00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.095]  The Democrats say they will.
[00:10:04.095 --> 00:10:09.116]  So again, they're going to contest.
[00:10:09.116 --> 00:10:12.037]  It'll be total fraud.
[00:10:12.037 --> 00:10:12.837]  That's their specialty.
[00:10:14.497 --> 00:10:20.526]  When they're the ones stealing it, they're the ones in bed with the Russians, the Chaikoms, so they say the Patriots are.
[00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:23.510]  They're the ones that are hurting children, so they say we are.
[00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.635]  It's always the inverse of reality with these people.
[00:10:30.336 --> 00:10:30.876]  There it is.
[00:10:30.876 --> 00:10:35.458]  Biden military will escort Trump out of the White House if he loses the election and refuses to leave.
[00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:36.679]  Print me that as well.
[00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:38.779]  I'll do the presentation last second of this hour.
[00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:45.042]  Okay, let me tell you what we're going to cover in the first hour, and then the second hour, and the third hour, and the fourth hour, because it's jam-packed.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:11:07.350]  I have absolute smoking gun on top of smoking gun, on top of red flag, on top of hand and cookie jar, on top of just absolute ridiculousness, that COVID-19 is a giant fraud at every level, every facet, every angle, designed for planetary takeover, AI takeover, depopulation, you name it.
[00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:15.875]  And now, on the CDC's own website, they say that COVID-19
[00:11:18.268 --> 00:11:20.750]  Is not.
[00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.032]  A epidemic.
[00:11:24.032 --> 00:11:26.453]  And that actually.
[00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:29.775]  It is a nose diving death curve.
[00:11:29.775 --> 00:11:34.938]  And that's why every headline you see says America's entered a black hole of COVID.
[00:11:34.938 --> 00:11:36.519]  America failed.
[00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:38.160]  America sucks.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.842]  America opened too early.
[00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:45.245]  America.
[00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:47.326]  Unbelievable.
[00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:57.857]  Meanwhile, right here on the CDC website, it says it's not.
[00:11:57.857 --> 00:12:10.586]  Because they admit that almost all the cases are false positives, because again, if you've ever had coronavirus or the flu, on average in a decade, you can lose the immunity, and it won't show up usually in about 10 years.
[00:12:10.586 --> 00:12:14.809]  That's why you take a shot every 10 years, if you believe in all their crap.
[00:12:14.809 --> 00:12:17.091]  And it turns out, they're almost all false positives.
[00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:19.913]  But, they're ramping up testing everywhere!
[00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:25.676]  And this whole thing is based on that fraud.
[00:12:25.676 --> 00:12:29.739]  And so when they say you're a hero and you need to wear your mask and all this, no.
[00:12:29.739 --> 00:12:37.686]  You're going along with total depression, election fraud, the end of the country, the third world, hundreds of millions dying, billions.
[00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:50.304]  Like a zombie apocalypse racing over our borders and the UN will direct the planetary collapse and we'll have world government and we'll be conquered militarily, economically, spiritually, culturally.
[00:12:50.304 --> 00:12:52.066]  This is the assault.
[00:12:52.066 --> 00:12:53.367]  It is official.
[00:12:53.367 --> 00:13:01.796]  I have all the documents and I will go into it in great detail again in the third hour today with all the details.
[00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:12.771]  We can defeat this if the people, and the military, and the Congress, and our allies around the world understand they're under the exact same attack plan.
[00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:16.574]  Bolsonaro understands.
[00:13:16.574 --> 00:13:18.856]  Boris Johnson understands on the surface.
[00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:20.417]  Nizel Farage understands.
[00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:22.039]  Do you understand?
[00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:24.421]  This is not some type of fear porn.
[00:13:24.421 --> 00:13:25.542]  This is the reality.
[00:13:27.062 --> 00:13:31.824]  It's like you hear your door knocked in, and dudes in black masks are in there with crowbars.
[00:13:31.824 --> 00:13:36.906]  You're gonna roll over and piss yourself, or you're gonna grab your shotgun and go to work.
[00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:42.469]  You better get yourselves ready.
[00:13:42.469 --> 00:13:44.970]  And I don't want you to physically get your shotguns and go to work.
[00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.992]  It's an allegory of politically blasting the truth out, not complying, saying no.
[00:13:49.992 --> 00:13:51.713]  I go in places all the time.
[00:13:51.713 --> 00:13:54.174]  The problem is I gotta have somebody go with me now so I can always get it on tape.
[00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:58.369]  And I just refuse.
[00:13:58.369 --> 00:14:01.330]  I don't even, I don't even say I have a medical reason not to wear it.
[00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.351]  That's the law.
[00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:03.251]  That's a waiver.
[00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:04.691]  Or I have anxiety, I don't have to.
[00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:06.252]  I start getting in their face about it.
[00:14:06.252 --> 00:14:10.333]  And when they say, fine, you can't shop here, I'd say, great, I'll never be here again.
[00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.374]  Tell your manager.
[00:14:12.374 --> 00:14:15.955]  They always go, sorry, I know it's a fraud too, okay?
[00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:16.896]  Well then say no!
[00:14:16.896 --> 00:14:19.957]  Because it's a test to see what you'll submit to.
[00:14:19.957 --> 00:14:20.957]  Sorry, let me tell you what's coming up.
[00:14:22.757 --> 00:14:30.323]  We have massive news here, not just tied into this, on the, well, just wait till next segment, on the COVID-19 hoax.
[00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:31.084]  I'm loaded for bear.
[00:14:31.084 --> 00:14:35.467]  This entire group of stacks here is unbelievable.
[00:14:35.467 --> 00:14:37.569]  Each one is three hours of radio time.
[00:14:37.569 --> 00:14:40.331]  I mean, it's just all over the top.
[00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:42.373]  We got Bohemian Grove news.
[00:14:42.373 --> 00:14:50.259]  The Supreme Court has handed over half of Oklahoma so they can defend a convicted child rapist.
[00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:51.200]  I'm not kidding.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.861]  That's no joke.
[00:14:53.024 --> 00:14:57.396]  Supreme Court gives half of Oklahoma a way to save pedophile rapists.
[00:14:57.396 --> 00:15:01.146]  Speaking of that, there's new news on gaslighting Maxwell.
[00:15:02.591 --> 00:15:05.374]  Mainstream News now admits everything you do is tracked by your phone.
[00:15:05.374 --> 00:15:12.641]  You're being listened to by corporations and they even can control what you're going to do later by stimuli to manipulate you.
[00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:23.412]  Wall Street Journal reports how you feel depends on where you are and they're admitting that the phones are tracking and watching you and actually creating psychological profiles on you to control your life.
[00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:25.554]  So I thought you might want to know that.
[00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:29.216]  We've got the latest SJW tear-down-the-nation operation.
[00:15:29.216 --> 00:15:34.499]  They're now pushing for Ford to no longer sell police cars to police.
[00:15:34.499 --> 00:15:36.000]  I'm not kidding.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.721]  And so much more.
[00:15:37.721 --> 00:15:46.266]  Joe Biden has officially adopted the Bernie Sanders platform and wants replacement migration, no borders, and 600 million migrants we pay for here double the U.S.
[00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:47.247]  population within 20 years.
[00:15:48.027 --> 00:15:49.772]  Total destruction is here.
[00:15:49.772 --> 00:15:52.558]  Absolute annihilation of all your freedom.
[00:15:52.558 --> 00:15:56.608]  That young lady about the viral video about she supports Trump, they're taking her high school diploma away.
[00:15:58.595 --> 00:16:04.161]  I am cutting this ad on Friday, and by Monday afternoon, we have to end this special.
[00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:12.731]  Because even though a lot of these items have been sold out and just came back in, we only ordered a limited amount of things like bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:16:12.731 --> 00:16:19.999]  Because quite frankly, the supply chain has broken down with COVID-19 and a lot of products we've been unable to even get back in stock.
[00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:23.381]  Because the companies we get them from are partially shut down.
[00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:24.622]  This is totally crazy.
[00:16:24.622 --> 00:16:35.088]  So you've got just a few days left to take advantage of the July 4th Mega Sale with storewide free shipping, double Patriot Points, and up to 60% off on high quality products.

[00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:37.109]  Thank you.
[00:16:57.987 --> 00:16:59.648]  It's finally here.

[00:17:51.221 --> 00:18:01.207]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:01.207 --> 00:18:03.809]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:19.424 --> 00:18:21.325]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:18:21.325 --> 00:18:28.908]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:32.930]  Alright, I am going to absolutely blow you away with the facts, with the evidence.
[00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:44.437]  The COVID-19 is an absolute planetary takeover plan and how to defeat it because people are submitting at a great level, but even small levels of resistance will derail it.
[00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:49.281]  And we've got way higher numbers of the resistance that we need to even stop it.
[00:18:49.281 --> 00:18:55.167]  But people need to know how to be targeted about this and how to expose the entire fraud.
[00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:57.129]  You don't battle little pieces of it.
[00:18:57.129 --> 00:18:58.590]  It gets lost in minutia.
[00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:58.970]  But first,
[00:18:59.844 --> 00:19:11.808]  You could give those different psychological names, but if you study authoritarians throughout history, it's a formula they've deployed, and in the 19th, 20th, and now 21st centuries, it's become not an art form, but a science.
[00:19:11.808 --> 00:19:17.409]  So, if we have a document we can have shot, please, I'm going to do a primitive illustration here.
[00:19:17.409 --> 00:19:22.331]  Here we are in January, and they've not closed the noose in around us yet.
[00:19:23.407 --> 00:19:25.429]  But monkey see, monkey do.
[00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:31.814]  We sit there and we watch what's happening in China and the apocalyptic images so we get scared.
[00:19:31.814 --> 00:19:35.898]  And so, that is the new normal, we believe, once it comes here.
[00:19:35.898 --> 00:19:40.002]  And we're told, oh, just 15 days because the hospitals will be overwhelmed.
[00:19:40.002 --> 00:19:41.943]  We're going to lock you in your house.
[00:19:41.943 --> 00:19:44.346]  So they close the noose down really, really tight.
[00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:50.710]  Then they know that you're going to really get upset, do your research, find out it's a fraud if they don't release the news.
[00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.534]  So after a couple months, they release it, but not all the way.
[00:19:54.534 --> 00:20:03.383]  They release it about 90%, but then instantly begin contracting it back down again.
[00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:10.391]  And they do this over and over again, each time not releasing it as much as they did last time.
[00:20:10.391 --> 00:20:19.373]  So through successive approximation, incrementalism, you end up where their endgame is, down here, a post-human world.
[00:20:19.373 --> 00:20:20.933]  Okay?
[00:20:20.933 --> 00:20:23.814]  In fact, when I talk about monkeys see monkey do, I meant to hit this yesterday.
[00:20:23.814 --> 00:20:25.875]  Guys, search engine this.
[00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:29.615]  Monkeys now adopting wearing mask.
[00:20:29.615 --> 00:20:32.316]  In India, in Africa,
[00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:42.514]  In Southeast Asia, monkeys have all now been seen picking up masks out of trash piles and putting them on.
[00:20:42.514 --> 00:20:50.818]  Now, we're a lot smarter than our fellow primate, these different types of monkeys that are doing this, but they think of humans as more advanced, as successful.
[00:20:50.818 --> 00:20:52.459]  They watch us closely.
[00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:59.603]  We drop food and stuff for them, and they know that we're more advanced, so they're now putting the mask on.
[00:20:59.603 --> 00:21:01.384]  They're now beginning to wear clothing.
[00:21:03.206 --> 00:21:05.728]  Now there you go, there's a monkey wearing a mask.
[00:21:05.728 --> 00:21:08.551]  This is happening all over the world now.
[00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:08.951]  Okay?
[00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:11.553]  Because they've been watching us doing it.
[00:21:11.553 --> 00:21:12.174]  Let's move on.
[00:21:13.749 --> 00:21:22.173]  Now are we smart enough to not be like the monkey and see that we're being put into a social construct called peer pressure?
[00:21:22.173 --> 00:21:36.300]  Now normally peer pressure, if you grew up in a village of a couple hundred people in some seaside little town, whether it was in the Pacific Ocean and you're Asian, or whether you were Northern European, or whether you were an African on the west coast of Africa, your tribe cared about you.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.002]  They stood up for you against other tribes.
[00:21:39.002 --> 00:21:39.882]  They taught you how to fish.
[00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:40.523]  They taught you how to hunt.
[00:21:40.523 --> 00:21:41.404]  They taught you how to cook.
[00:21:41.404 --> 00:21:42.565]  They taught you how to sew.
[00:21:42.565 --> 00:21:43.745]  They taught you medicine.
[00:21:43.745 --> 00:21:46.187]  The witch doctors taught you about different herbs and plants.
[00:21:46.187 --> 00:21:51.912]  And, you know, if somebody was a little weird or bad, they got thrown out of the tribe or they got their head beat in.
[00:21:51.912 --> 00:21:54.854]  They got thrown off a cliff.
[00:21:54.854 --> 00:21:58.577]  That's how justice operated and how we built civilization.
[00:21:58.577 --> 00:22:00.499]  But when you get to this point of corruption,
[00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:15.290]  And if the global is feeding on us and breeding us like cattle and controlling us and that there's a scientific establishment that's broken the social construct with us and broken the social compact, compliance is not success.
[00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:22.195]  You're 10 years old with your tribe and the 70-year-old elder and your 30-year-old dad and all the rest of them are telling you things.
[00:22:22.195 --> 00:22:23.836]  Most of the time it's going to be right.
[00:22:23.836 --> 00:22:25.837]  And complying is a good thing.
[00:22:25.837 --> 00:22:29.960]  You comply with David Rockefeller and Bill Gates and Queen Beatrix
[00:22:31.069 --> 00:22:33.230]  Who openly said they want your ass dead.
[00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.071]  You're an idiot!
[00:22:35.071 --> 00:22:38.693]  I'm not complying with none of it!
[00:22:38.693 --> 00:22:40.794]  I'll comply with common sense.
[00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:42.715]  I will not comply with my own destruction.
[00:22:42.715 --> 00:22:45.457]  So let's lay it out right now.
[00:22:45.457 --> 00:22:51.300]  CDC feels pressured from Trump as RIF grows over coronavirus response.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.981]  Because Trump knows it's a fraud.
[00:22:52.981 --> 00:22:55.302]  He knows that bureaucracy works for Bill Gates.
[00:22:55.302 --> 00:22:58.644]  Trump, as I told you first, a month and a half ago, was going to sideline Fauci.
[00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:00.511]  Happened two weeks later.
[00:23:00.511 --> 00:23:02.572]  They even used the term sideline.
[00:23:02.572 --> 00:23:03.813]  Had that directly from the White House.
[00:23:03.813 --> 00:23:05.354]  That they got the message.
[00:23:05.354 --> 00:23:07.775]  I've advised the White House, destroy him.
[00:23:07.775 --> 00:23:08.895]  Destroy Gates.
[00:23:08.895 --> 00:23:09.875]  Annihilate them.
[00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:12.697]  They have, they've got the patents on the vaccines.
[00:23:12.697 --> 00:23:13.897]  They pre-planned it all.
[00:23:13.897 --> 00:23:15.438]  You're starting to see that come out.
[00:23:15.438 --> 00:23:16.458]  Trump's the real deal, folks.
[00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:18.019]  But he's got to hit them now.
[00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:20.080]  He can't wait.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.820]  And he's the President.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.102]  These are traitors working with China.
[00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:26.142]  I mean, hit them politically, President, as hard as you want.
[00:23:26.142 --> 00:23:27.103]  The American people will back it.
[00:23:28.387 --> 00:23:30.569]  Or maybe Fauci just goes away on a long trip.
[00:23:30.569 --> 00:23:31.470]  Along with Bill Gates somewhere.
[00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.332]  Maybe they just vacation together someplace we never see him again.
[00:23:34.332 --> 00:23:35.133]  Who knows?
[00:23:35.133 --> 00:23:37.635]  They're like Whitman, Price and the Dodd.
[00:23:37.635 --> 00:23:41.358]  Their debt to society paid in full.
[00:23:41.358 --> 00:23:43.080]  Last season's winners.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.461]  Let's continue.
[00:23:44.461 --> 00:23:49.706]  Colorado town threatens a year in jail for residents who refuse to wear a mask.
[00:23:49.706 --> 00:23:51.867]  $2,000 fines in Austin.
[00:23:54.454 --> 00:23:56.154]  See, it's more draconian.
[00:23:56.154 --> 00:23:58.555]  They tighten the noose, loosen the noose.
[00:23:58.555 --> 00:24:01.235]  Tighten the noose, but don't loosen it as much.
[00:24:01.235 --> 00:24:02.655]  Tighten it more the next time.
[00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:04.076]  Don't loosen it as much.
[00:24:04.076 --> 00:24:08.997]  Because they found you'll struggle out up front if you know it's death up front.
[00:24:08.997 --> 00:24:12.937]  But if they can just tighten it, and then let it go.
[00:24:12.937 --> 00:24:14.098]  Tighten it, and then let it go.
[00:24:14.098 --> 00:24:15.718]  And that's, both the strippers actually do that.
[00:24:15.718 --> 00:24:17.658]  They get around you, they squeeze.
[00:24:17.658 --> 00:24:21.159]  When you really fight hard, they kind of let off a little, knowing you're going to...
[00:24:22.645 --> 00:24:26.168]  So the best thing to understand is you got a boa constrictor just got around you.
[00:24:26.168 --> 00:24:31.813]  And if you think listening to it and doing what it says while it hisses in your ear is a good idea, well then, just lay back.
[00:24:31.813 --> 00:24:37.377]  He's going to break your ribs and unhinge his jaw and swallow you down whole.
[00:24:37.377 --> 00:24:40.119]  As for me, I'm going down fighting with old Bill Gates.
[00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:45.864]  Fauci says he hasn't briefed Trump on COVID-19 in two months.
[00:24:45.864 --> 00:24:46.545]  The U.S.
[00:24:46.545 --> 00:24:46.625]  is
[00:24:47.895 --> 00:24:52.748]  Diving into the dark COVID hole and there's no plan to get out, says CNN.
[00:24:53.803 --> 00:25:00.847]  Meanwhile, the deaths have totally plunged because everybody found out they were killing the old people and killing people so they can't do the ventilators.
[00:25:00.847 --> 00:25:02.669]  We need ventilators!
[00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:07.892]  We need millions of them or we won't get up to the two million dead, said Cuomo.
[00:25:07.892 --> 00:25:09.153]  Remember?
[00:25:09.153 --> 00:25:16.617]  I need hundreds of thousands in New York alone, but you didn't get them so you couldn't kill enough people.
[00:25:16.617 --> 00:25:20.240]  See, they've got it all planned out, but see, we didn't go along with it.
[00:25:21.499 --> 00:25:34.107]  So now they've got all these cases, but the doctors are learning that steroids stop it, and that it's an autoimmune, and hydroxychloroquine, they demonize, stop it, and taking zinc stops it, and so they're pissed!
[00:25:34.107 --> 00:25:39.671]  Because it's not going the way it was supposed to!
[00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:40.672]  So let's get into it right now.
[00:25:42.227 --> 00:25:53.657]  When we come back, CDC says COVID-19 no longer an epidemic as current rate of decline of deaths, not increase of cases that are false.
[00:25:53.657 --> 00:25:57.681]  And then the big enchilada when we come back, I haven't gotten to this yet, we have the video.
[00:25:59.457 --> 00:26:04.679]  Head of Emergency Management for the state of Texas should wear a mask inside their homes.
[00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:06.840]  See, that's also Overton Window.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.101]  You're struggling, saying, I don't want to wear it outside or in restaurants.
[00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:11.362]  He goes, hey, that's not enough.
[00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:15.943]  Not even in your own house should you not have a mask off.
[00:26:15.943 --> 00:26:17.544]  So that makes it sound reasonable.
[00:26:17.544 --> 00:26:21.785]  Hey, you know, you should be wearing it in your house, buddy.
[00:26:21.785 --> 00:26:23.466]  Not just outside.
[00:26:23.466 --> 00:26:25.827]  And this morning, I went
[00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:29.244]  We're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:29.244 --> 00:26:32.345]  I'll tell you all these stories when we come back on the other side.
[00:26:32.345 --> 00:26:33.966]  There is just so much going on.
[00:26:33.966 --> 00:26:37.728]  It is so over the top, all of it.
[00:26:37.728 --> 00:26:46.912]  And the only way to override it is to admit it head on, admit it's all a fraud, admit it's a criminal action, call people out and charge them as the murdering, mastermind criminals they are.
[00:26:46.912 --> 00:26:48.493]  And I know that's going to happen.
[00:26:48.493 --> 00:26:49.153]  We're going to win.
[00:26:49.153 --> 00:26:52.075]  Stay with us.
[00:26:53.291 --> 00:26:55.972]  Yippee-ki-yay!
[00:26:55.972 --> 00:27:00.855]  We need to get back to the land, back to self-sufficiency, and back to being prepared.
[00:27:00.855 --> 00:27:09.380]  And the way to start, ladies and gentlemen, is having friends and family with a bug-out plan if there is a total collapse and water filtration and food to last you at least a few months.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.541]  And the food we have is very high quality.
[00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:15.262]  It's in great containers that are great to be mobile.
[00:27:15.262 --> 00:27:17.843]  They have wide selections, special diets, you name it.
[00:27:17.843 --> 00:27:23.426]  It's the best price you're going to find, but you need to get the orders in now, in the lull before the storm.
[00:27:23.426 --> 00:27:25.246]  I told you lockdown 2 was coming.
[00:27:25.246 --> 00:27:27.167]  The New World Order is making its move.
[00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:28.368]  Whether Trump loses or wins,
[00:27:28.948 --> 00:27:34.392]  Things are just going to get more crazy, and this food lasts 25 years inside the containers.
[00:27:34.392 --> 00:27:46.342]  So it's something you can hide, something you can bury, something you know is an ace in the hole for you and your family in the future, and the little bit of profit that comes in funds the InfoWar to continue to warn the people.
[00:27:46.342 --> 00:27:52.567]  So you're also funding InfoWars, the most powerful Paul Revere organization in the world, and it's powered by you.
[00:27:56.977 --> 00:27:58.738]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[00:27:58.738 --> 00:27:59.218]  You're on the air.
[00:27:59.218 --> 00:28:00.839]  Thanks for holding.
[00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:01.459]  I sure can, sir.
[00:28:01.459 --> 00:28:01.779]  Thank you.
[00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:04.600]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[00:28:12.783 --> 00:28:14.244]  I just want to plug in.
[00:28:14.244 --> 00:28:18.666]  I'm a truck driver and two of the fours have changed the way I drive.
[00:28:18.666 --> 00:28:20.607]  Me and my brothers that drive.
[00:28:20.607 --> 00:28:21.908]  There's a couple of us.
[00:28:21.908 --> 00:28:25.289]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[00:28:25.289 --> 00:28:33.353]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[00:28:34.053 --> 00:28:39.696]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[00:28:39.696 --> 00:28:41.957]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[00:28:41.957 --> 00:28:44.459]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[00:28:44.459 --> 00:28:47.120]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.162]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:52.963]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[00:28:52.963 --> 00:28:53.684]  So that means a lot to me.
[00:28:53.684 --> 00:28:54.044]  Thank you.
[00:28:54.044 --> 00:28:56.145]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[00:28:56.145 --> 00:29:01.468]  I must end this special, our extended July 4 special, by Monday the 12th.
[00:29:02.368 --> 00:29:04.990]  That is our drop dead date.
[00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:13.775]  It absolutely has to happen because a lot of these products that have been sold out, we can only get limited supplies of them because the supply chain is breaking down.
[00:29:13.775 --> 00:29:18.959]  Winter Sun with vitamin D3 and vitamin K, sold out for months, back in stock, 50% off.
[00:29:18.959 --> 00:29:24.262]  Ultra 12, high quality B12, take note of the tongue, sold out for months, back in stock, 50% off.
[00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:30.346]  Bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula, super strong turmeric concentration, sold out for months, back in stock, limited amount,
[00:29:30.966 --> 00:29:33.888]  50% off, double Patriot points, free shipping.
[00:29:33.888 --> 00:29:39.572]  It's the same thing with Vitamin Refusion, Survival Shield X3, and so much more.
[00:29:39.572 --> 00:29:41.333]  And it funds the information war.
[00:29:41.333 --> 00:29:44.075]  The globalists want you sick and weak and dumbed down.
[00:29:44.075 --> 00:29:46.837]  They don't want you to know what God has given us all through Mother Nature.
[00:29:46.837 --> 00:29:48.238]  These products are powerful.
[00:29:48.238 --> 00:29:50.319]  Many of you have tried them and reordered them and loved them.
[00:29:50.319 --> 00:29:51.160]  Many of you haven't.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.722]  The sale ends in just a few days, so take action now and get free shipping at importwars4.com.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:09.609]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:09.609 --> 00:30:14.793]  Fighting enemies, foreign
[00:30:28.078 --> 00:30:29.839]  And domestic, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:34.122]  Okay, let's plow right into the documentation.
[00:30:34.122 --> 00:30:49.893]  If you go directly to the CDC website, it tells you right there that COVID-19 numbers of deaths have plunged, so it's no longer an epidemic, meaning deaths.
[00:30:49.893 --> 00:30:53.075]  But they can confuse the public by having all these false positive tests,
[00:30:53.993 --> 00:30:58.335]  And say that it is a pandemic, and as the testing explodes, the numbers explode.
[00:30:58.335 --> 00:31:07.559]  You see the state of Texas doing the most testing of anybody, California second, New York third, and Florida fourth.
[00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:10.460]  That's where you have the big outbreaks, because it's the testing.
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.281]  And the CDC website says most of those are fake.
[00:31:13.281 --> 00:31:22.585]  Remember, presidents and prime ministers in other countries have sent off papayas and goats and dirt, and they test positive for COVID-19 because it's the coronavirus.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:33.128]  Coronaviruses are the most common thing floating around that is quasi-alive.
[00:31:33.128 --> 00:31:36.230]  So continuing, based on death certificate data,
[00:31:37.108 --> 00:31:55.960]  The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, they add all those together, decreased from 9.0 during week 25 to 5.9 during week 26, representing the 10th week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:04.686]  The percentage is currently at the epidemic threshold, but will likely change as more death certificates are processed, particularly in recent weeks.
[00:32:06.343 --> 00:32:09.945]  And these numbers are about two weeks old, but the word is it's going to go down even more.
[00:32:09.945 --> 00:32:12.466]  But they show you all these maps with red everywhere.
[00:32:12.466 --> 00:32:15.387]  It's fraud.
[00:32:15.387 --> 00:32:16.328]  Now here's the headline.
[00:32:16.328 --> 00:32:18.869]  This is out of News 4, San Antonio.
[00:32:18.869 --> 00:32:25.912]  There's a more detailed article on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:32:25.912 --> 00:32:31.975]  Head of Emergency Management says Texas should wear masks inside their own homes.
[00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:39.316]  And the model he's using is Italy, where most of the deaths were in nursing homes.
[00:32:39.316 --> 00:32:47.643]  And nurses came out five months ago in Italy and said, they're putting healthy COVID patients that test positive in nursing homes.
[00:32:47.643 --> 00:32:49.365]  We've never done this.
[00:32:49.365 --> 00:32:50.886]  They're using them as incubators.
[00:32:50.886 --> 00:32:52.367]  They're killing old people.
[00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:55.390]  And even then I thought, well, maybe that nurse is going a little too far.
[00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:59.414]  Then we learned it was being done here under the UN regulations.
[00:33:00.455 --> 00:33:02.116]  Trump found out and told him to stop.
[00:33:02.116 --> 00:33:02.856]  They tried to spin it.
[00:33:02.856 --> 00:33:03.797]  Oh, Trump's fault.
[00:33:03.797 --> 00:33:05.097]  He's the government.
[00:33:05.097 --> 00:33:06.858]  So the traitors of the government follow the UN.
[00:33:06.858 --> 00:33:07.599]  They do this.
[00:33:07.599 --> 00:33:11.060]  Trump finds out, stops them, and they go, Cuomo goes, well, don't blame me.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.301]  Trump told me to do it.
[00:33:12.301 --> 00:33:16.923]  Oh, is that why it was only blue cities and blue states that did it?
[00:33:16.923 --> 00:33:20.345]  No, you are a murderer, Cuomo.
[00:33:20.345 --> 00:33:23.766]  And Letitia James, your attorney general, is a murderer.
[00:33:23.766 --> 00:33:24.387]  She ordered
[00:33:25.421 --> 00:33:31.846]  The hospitals and nursing homes, when they said this is a death sentence, this is a default position, just like it was a default position 10 years ago.
[00:33:31.846 --> 00:33:33.507]  Never give a pregnant woman a vaccine.
[00:33:33.507 --> 00:33:36.670]  Said on the insert, induces miscarriage.
[00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:40.233]  Now they say on the news, it needs to be done extra.
[00:33:40.233 --> 00:33:42.274]  It's all about practicing evil.
[00:33:42.274 --> 00:33:47.959]  Governor Northam, a murderer, saying they keep babies alive and take their organs.
[00:33:51.055 --> 00:33:52.877]  But they keep them comfortable, so it's okay.
[00:33:52.877 --> 00:33:56.560]  See, they're just throwing it in your face, breaking your will.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.861]  You say, why are they so evil?
[00:33:57.861 --> 00:33:59.562]  Why are they so out in the open?
[00:33:59.562 --> 00:34:01.124]  They're doing it on purpose.
[00:34:01.124 --> 00:34:02.845]  Psychiatrists are running this.
[00:34:02.845 --> 00:34:06.949]  This is a psych warfare operation to break your will.
[00:34:06.949 --> 00:34:09.411]  And folks are getting that now.
[00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:13.775]  So, head of emergency management says Texans should wear masks inside their homes.
[00:34:15.026 --> 00:34:16.566]  So this morning, I was doing an errand.
[00:34:16.566 --> 00:34:18.907]  I was in a little strip center area.
[00:34:18.907 --> 00:34:20.007]  It was full of parking.
[00:34:20.007 --> 00:34:30.129]  So I parked a little down the street by a residential area, and I get back in my car, and I see what looks like some joggers, walkers, about 100 yards away.
[00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:42.171]  By the time I roll up the window and turn on the car, they're about 50 yards away, and I'm on my phone, taking a call, and I notice that they're waiting and pointing at me, but they've got a whole sidewalk and everything.
[00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:44.192]  And so I get off the phone, and I'm sitting there watching them,
[00:34:45.237 --> 00:34:45.397]  I don't
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:10.423]  Probably, you know, here working for a tech company, probably Chinese citizens.
[00:35:10.423 --> 00:35:16.787]  Because there, their phones track them for every foot they are, and if they go by another person, their social credit score goes down.
[00:35:16.787 --> 00:35:20.770]  So to them, it's like a big video game to follow the AI to prepare themselves.
[00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.412]  And the AI is already in place, the public's just being told about it now.
[00:35:24.412 --> 00:35:34.980]  So to watch the next level of conformity, a hundred yards away, and then 50 yards away, stopping and waiting for me on a quiet,
[00:35:36.135 --> 00:35:44.679]  Street looked like Mayberry off a little strip center by my neighborhood.
[00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:48.501]  And now there's reports of people pulling guns on customers for not wearing masks.
[00:35:48.501 --> 00:35:49.602]  The man was arrested.
[00:35:49.602 --> 00:35:51.042]  That's on Infowars.com.
[00:35:51.042 --> 00:35:51.963]  This is the hysteria.
[00:35:51.963 --> 00:36:03.409]  So when you watch Santa Ana, our governor, our dictator, our emperor, Greg Abbott, who's the only Republican governor following these orders, but more are now going to capitulate because of his
[00:36:04.443 --> 00:36:05.764]  Evil leadership.
[00:36:05.764 --> 00:36:07.104]  That's why it was so evil.
[00:36:07.104 --> 00:36:15.567]  The man you always see standing behind him is Texas Chief Nim Kidd.
[00:36:15.567 --> 00:36:21.950]  You always see Nim Kidd behind the governor wearing his mask.
[00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:30.493]  And he says, do not leave your house without a mask, but also in your house, wear a mask because you're such a bad person.
[00:36:30.493 --> 00:36:31.233]  You're so evil.
[00:36:31.233 --> 00:36:31.934]  You're so dangerous.
[00:36:31.934 --> 00:36:32.214]  Here it is.
[00:36:33.507 --> 00:36:37.329]  Today is we need to do that when we're in our homes also.
[00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:45.232]  As you know, I'm a lifelong San Antonio and grew up there, worked there for many years, and I know how many multi-generational families that we have.
[00:36:45.232 --> 00:36:55.477]  And while we believe the community is doing a great job of following the rules when they're outside of the home, we really need to be thinking about doing the same thing when we're inside the home.
[00:36:55.477 --> 00:36:59.398]  And all of us are capable of catching this disease.
[00:36:59.398 --> 00:37:00.559]  None of us are immune from this.
[00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:06.624]  And the fact that we need to get across this in order to protect ourselves, we need to protect our families and our loved ones.
[00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:15.612]  We really need to be thinking about the care that we're providing inside the home right now to make sure that we're not spreading this disease inside the home and then making it come outside the house.
[00:37:15.612 --> 00:37:16.572]  So let me get this straight.
[00:37:16.572 --> 00:37:20.456]  What you're effectively saying is that people should be wearing masks inside their own homes now?
[00:37:21.269 --> 00:37:35.933]  Ryan, I'm saying if you can't socially distance and can't socially isolate, or if you've been out in public and exposing yourself, and you haven't decontaminated yourself good enough when you get home, if you have someone that has underlying medical conditions at home, we really need to be thinking about it.
[00:37:35.933 --> 00:37:36.553]  I've turned this idiot off.
[00:37:36.553 --> 00:37:45.036]  Okay, if you want to know the road to hell, what it's paved with, it's paved with Chief of Texas Emergency Management System, Nim Kidd.
[00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:48.121]  You can tell he really means well.
[00:37:48.121 --> 00:37:49.644]  He's a good boy.
[00:37:49.644 --> 00:37:52.490]  Well, you can trust him to water your plants when you're on vacation.
[00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.833]  I bet he never stole a nickel.
[00:37:54.653 --> 00:37:57.676]  But he's a follower and dumb as a box of rocks.
[00:37:57.676 --> 00:38:16.151]  Hey, Nim, the United Nations five months ago released their global guidelines, and it said that by the fall, they would have contact tracers going into everyone's homes, separating people from old people and children, and forcibly testing people and locking down apartment blocks first.
[00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:19.834]  Started in Spain, started just this week in Australia.
[00:38:19.834 --> 00:38:20.695]  We played that yesterday.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:27.662]  You are walking us into a boa constrictor, into a noose that's closing.
[00:38:27.662 --> 00:38:30.163]  And so, they lied about the numbers that would die.
[00:38:30.163 --> 00:38:32.084]  They lied about the number of people that died of other things.
[00:38:32.084 --> 00:38:33.384]  They have fake testing.
[00:38:33.384 --> 00:38:34.065]  Everybody knows it.
[00:38:34.065 --> 00:38:37.846]  The governor admits that most of the tests are fake.
[00:38:37.846 --> 00:38:41.267]  But he still says, if we could save one person.
[00:38:41.267 --> 00:38:41.827]  That's right.
[00:38:41.827 --> 00:38:43.328]  The whole economy collapses.
[00:38:43.328 --> 00:38:46.969]  Old people can be put in nursing homes and no one can come see them now.
[00:38:46.969 --> 00:38:49.790]  And so, they can die magically.
[00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:50.671]  You're setting it up.
[00:38:51.517 --> 00:38:51.884]  Tim!
[00:38:52.964 --> 00:39:01.710]  Nim, dumb, kid, or whatever your name is, to let the real killers with their actuaries, the eugenicists, the bioethics boards, come in.
[00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.412]  You know how to deal with a flood, Nim Kim.
[00:39:04.412 --> 00:39:07.754]  You know how to deal with fires, Nim Kid.
[00:39:07.754 --> 00:39:08.995]  You're a firefighter.
[00:39:08.995 --> 00:39:10.276]  You're not a doctor!
[00:39:10.276 --> 00:39:12.157]  Bill Gates isn't a doctor!
[00:39:12.157 --> 00:39:16.420]  Now, you're not a psychotic like Bill Gates that runs this whole thing, but let me tell you something.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.861]  You're aiding and abetting murderers.
[00:39:18.861 --> 00:39:19.702]  Murderers!
[00:39:19.702 --> 00:39:22.264]  Stop murdering us, Nim Kid!
[00:39:23.664 --> 00:39:29.226]  When we come back, I'll get into the coup plan against Trump that's now active and live, openly announced by Democrats.
[00:39:29.226 --> 00:39:32.247]  But first, we'll play the director of the U.N.
[00:39:32.247 --> 00:39:34.127]  emergency response operation.
[00:39:34.127 --> 00:39:40.850]  His counterpart that wrote this up, he's the head of emergency in Texas, he gets his orders down to the CDC from the U.N.
[00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:51.713]  directly from Dr. Michael J. Ryan that says, we're coming to take your children, your parents, we're coming into your houses, and this piece of trash is getting us ready for it.
[00:39:52.133 --> 00:39:53.638]  He hasn't even gotten the memo yet!
[00:39:53.638 --> 00:39:54.662]  In about a month he will!
[00:39:56.522 --> 00:40:00.384]  The July 4th Mega Sale ends on July 12th.
[00:40:00.384 --> 00:40:14.792]  Store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points, 50 to 60% off all these best-selling items, including a bunch that have been sold out for months and are back in limited supply, like Winner, some of vitamin D3 and vitamin K for your immune system, sold out back in stock.

[00:40:23.477 --> 00:40:24.697]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:40:24.697 --> 00:40:24.997]  God bless.
[00:40:55.313 --> 00:40:57.894]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[00:40:57.894 --> 00:41:10.680]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:11.640]  I think?
[00:41:31.235 --> 00:41:35.239]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[00:41:35.239 --> 00:41:40.483]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[00:41:40.483 --> 00:41:48.330]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:52.174]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[00:41:52.174 --> 00:41:54.216]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[00:41:56.556 --> 00:42:00.199]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:07.285]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.

[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.784]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[00:42:28.784 --> 00:42:33.391]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from rising pressure.
[00:42:33.391 --> 00:42:38.498]  That's why we worked hard to create a new formula to support your fight against stress in your hectic day.
[00:42:38.498 --> 00:42:42.684]  Chill Force is our solution for a true, healthy, relaxation support formula.
[00:42:42.844 --> 00:42:44.725]  I am cutting this breaking announcement on July 9th.
[00:42:44.725 --> 00:42:46.626]  By Monday, we will have to end the biggest sale yet of the year.
[00:42:46.626 --> 00:42:47.306]  Storewide, free shipping.
[00:43:06.135 --> 00:43:16.883]  Double Patriot Points is the July 4th sale, the tail end of it, and all of the high-quality products that were sold out have been back in stock and are available again, but some of these are in limited numbers.
[00:43:16.883 --> 00:43:22.808]  Ladies and gentlemen, not just store-wide free shipping, Double Patriot Points, but we have DNA Force Plus, back in stock, 50% off.
[00:43:22.808 --> 00:43:27.351]  Winter Sun with vitamin D3 and K, so good for your immune system, back in stock, 50% off.
[00:43:27.351 --> 00:43:32.115]  Ultra 12, high-quality B12, take it under the tongue, 50% off, back in stock, and again,
[00:43:32.475 --> 00:43:34.456]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:44:09.431 --> 00:44:16.453]  Mr. President, you tweeted earlier linking the closing of the country to your election success in November.
[00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:19.194]  Is this Easter timeline based on your political interests?
[00:44:19.194 --> 00:44:20.895]  What do you mean by my election success?
[00:44:20.895 --> 00:44:26.696]  You tweeted, you said that the media wants the country to remain closed to hurt your... No, no, I think the media, yeah.
[00:44:26.696 --> 00:44:28.197]  Just so you understand, are you ready?
[00:44:28.897 --> 00:44:32.080]  I think there are certain people that would like it not to open so quickly.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:39.727]  I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls.
[00:44:39.727 --> 00:44:43.251]  Because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy.
[00:44:43.251 --> 00:44:45.072]  So please, bring on the recession.
[00:44:45.072 --> 00:44:48.916]  One woman said, I want a recession because that'll help get rid of Donald Trump.
[00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:50.739]  I call this another Trump slump.
[00:44:50.739 --> 00:44:52.701]  The threat of recession is real.
[00:44:52.701 --> 00:44:56.227]  We would see the global economy entering recession in three quarters.
[00:44:56.227 --> 00:44:57.969]  Perfect timing, I say.
[00:44:57.969 --> 00:44:59.692]  I mean, I've been rooting for a recession.
[00:44:59.692 --> 00:45:05.300]  But if the global economy, including the United States, is taking a step toward recession, what does that mean for this presidency?
[00:45:06.621 --> 00:45:07.821]  It's political suicide.
[00:45:07.821 --> 00:45:09.923]  These numbers are irrefutable.
[00:45:09.923 --> 00:45:14.085]  There are people in your profession that would like that to happen.
[00:45:14.085 --> 00:45:21.570]  I think it's very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news.
[00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:22.591]  You do.
[00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:23.611]  She does.
[00:45:23.611 --> 00:45:26.573]  There are people in your profession that write fake news.
[00:45:26.573 --> 00:45:31.056]  They would love to see me for whatever reason because we've done one hell of a job.
[00:45:31.056 --> 00:45:32.617]  Nobody's done the job that we've done.
[00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:40.818]  The president went on Fox News and lied to millions of people about the coronavirus outbreak because his administration bungles its response to the crisis.
[00:45:40.818 --> 00:45:42.800]  For more on this, it's time for A Closer Look.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:48.125]  With the world on edge, people are looking to their leaders for reassurance and answers.
[00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:49.547]  Unfortunately, we have him.
[00:45:49.547 --> 00:45:52.450]  It's a serious thing that needs to be dealt with seriously.
[00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:56.434]  And right now, the federal government is failing.
[00:45:56.434 --> 00:45:57.695]  Stop lying.
[00:45:58.052 --> 00:46:03.395]  When in the middle of a severe public health emergency, the president just lies about it over and over and over again.
[00:46:03.395 --> 00:46:07.978]  Trump keeps lying to people about the potential threat posed by the spread of the coronavirus.
[00:46:07.978 --> 00:46:10.360]  This may be Donald Trump's Katrina.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.481]  Donald Trump is not in charge here.
[00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:14.762]  The governors are in charge.
[00:46:14.762 --> 00:46:19.005]  This is an event that could take down a president.
[00:46:19.005 --> 00:46:25.109]  And it's lucky that you have this group here right now for this problem, or you wouldn't even have a country left, okay?
[00:46:25.953 --> 00:46:26.814]  How dare you!
[00:46:26.814 --> 00:46:29.116]  Batman is failing right now.
[00:46:29.116 --> 00:46:31.498]  This may be Donald Trump's Katrina.
[00:46:31.498 --> 00:46:33.059]  Yeah, you can interpret it.
[00:46:33.059 --> 00:46:33.900]  Let's just lean into that.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.341]  How many deaths are acceptable?
[00:46:40.658 --> 00:46:41.218]  None.
[00:46:41.218 --> 00:46:47.544]  But as far as the winning economy that the president needs from now until November, do you really see that changing?
[00:46:47.544 --> 00:46:58.175]  If the stock market were to tumble this year, if we don't get near the 3% GDP growth that this administration has been talking about for years, these are all things that Dems can run on and they pose a problem.
[00:46:58.175 --> 00:47:00.937]  A recession is a survivable event.
[00:47:00.937 --> 00:47:03.440]  What Trump is doing to this country is not.
[00:47:07.873 --> 00:47:09.754]  Fear is freedom!
[00:47:09.754 --> 00:47:12.095]  Subjugation is liberation!
[00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:14.176]  Contradiction is truth!
[00:47:14.176 --> 00:47:16.577]  Those are the facts of this world!
[00:47:16.577 --> 00:47:19.119]  And you will all surrender to them!
[00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:28.023]  You pigs in human clothing!
[00:47:28.023 --> 00:47:32.325]  That translates to, hope you enjoy your depression!
[00:47:32.325 --> 00:47:33.826]  Sorry.
[00:47:33.826 --> 00:47:34.126]  Go ahead.
[00:47:35.273 --> 00:47:39.215]  No, probably best they don't.
[00:47:39.215 --> 00:47:42.938]  And that's a couple months old.
[00:47:42.938 --> 00:47:58.007]  So they planned it all, they ran it all, they own the virus that mimics all these other cold viruses so now they can just scare the hell out of everybody forever, confuse everybody, lie to you, kill old people, create false positives, bankrupt everything, come in your house, take your kids away.
[00:47:59.229 --> 00:48:22.339]  Here's the head of the UN Global Emergency Response to Disasters and Medical Crises, Dr. Ryan, and he is through the UNWHO down to the NIH CDC, the state of Texas, who this man takes his orders from, the Texas Division of Emergency Management head, Chief Nim Kidd, who says
[00:48:24.244 --> 00:48:36.415]  Don't leave your house without a mask, and you need to wear one in your house, and then already in Australia, already in Spain, they've begun coming to the houses, taking the families away, breaking them up.
[00:48:36.415 --> 00:48:36.775]  Here it is.
[00:48:39.045 --> 00:48:49.111]  In most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[00:48:49.111 --> 00:48:55.594]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[00:48:55.594 --> 00:49:05.080]  Now, we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[00:49:05.757 --> 00:49:16.155]  And by the way, Dr. Michael Ryan was in the John Hopkins Event 201 two-month drill in October-November last year where coronavirus is released.
[00:49:17.501 --> 00:49:18.962]  And they bring in world government with it.
[00:49:18.962 --> 00:49:20.383]  And then they just drilled it.
[00:49:20.383 --> 00:49:21.384]  They already knew it was out there.
[00:49:21.384 --> 00:49:22.044]  They announced it.
[00:49:22.044 --> 00:49:23.265]  It's a bad pneumonia.
[00:49:23.265 --> 00:49:24.566]  They know it's treated with steroids.
[00:49:24.566 --> 00:49:29.130]  They know it's treated with COVID-19 can be treated very well with hydroxychloroquine.
[00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:32.172]  They know people can get it if they're vitamin mineral deficient.
[00:49:32.172 --> 00:49:43.781]  But that's why they had a battle plan through Facebook, Twitter, Google to suppress medical doctors and Cedars-Sinai and scientists and virologists who would come out and help.
[00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:44.782]  They're like, well, what do we do?
[00:49:44.782 --> 00:49:46.443]  The medical field is going to expose this.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:58.733]  Well simple, we let the centralized systems say what's available and day one they said, starting in January, only the UN can say stuff about COVID.
[00:49:58.733 --> 00:50:04.199]  Not your doctor, not the CDC, not your state, no one but the United Nations.
[00:50:04.199 --> 00:50:06.522]  You've heard that 10,000 times haven't you?
[00:50:06.522 --> 00:50:07.984]  You've read it, it's everywhere.
[00:50:08.885 --> 00:50:10.106]  Just like that.
[00:50:10.106 --> 00:50:11.768]  You're inside world government.
[00:50:11.768 --> 00:50:16.073]  I've got a lot more on this, but $2,000 fines.
[00:50:16.073 --> 00:50:19.917]  Austin, by the way, a big tidbit in the announcement that Austin made.
[00:50:19.917 --> 00:50:25.824]  Everybody's getting freaked out by the $2,000 a day fines.
[00:50:25.824 --> 00:50:27.525]  But look right here out of the KVUE.
[00:50:28.672 --> 00:50:32.635]  News has got a link to the new ordinance.
[00:50:32.635 --> 00:50:41.722]  $2,000 fine through December 31st for any violation of any of the lockdown orders of the lockdown that is going through December 31st.
[00:50:41.722 --> 00:50:43.304]  So we're already in the lockdown.
[00:50:43.304 --> 00:50:44.805]  They already passed the law.
[00:50:44.805 --> 00:50:46.106]  The governor already agreed.
[00:50:46.106 --> 00:50:48.848]  But the mayor's up there going, gee, I don't know if I'm going to do it.
[00:50:48.848 --> 00:50:50.770]  It's going to hurt businesses.
[00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:51.470]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:52.831]  I'm going to have to.
[00:50:52.831 --> 00:50:55.553]  And every mayor follows the same script that comes out of
[00:50:56.334 --> 00:51:05.296]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the big foundations that cooked it up, threw the UN down to us, and we're now under United Nations global government control.
[00:51:05.296 --> 00:51:18.558]  And our stinking governor and our stinking emergency head are just jackass dumbasses who just follow orders and don't give a hell.
[00:51:18.558 --> 00:51:20.818]  Unbelievable.
[00:51:20.818 --> 00:51:22.639]  Trump's figured this out.
[00:51:22.639 --> 00:51:23.499]  He's fighting back.
[00:51:23.499 --> 00:51:24.359]  We're going to go over it all.
[00:51:27.099 --> 00:51:34.201]  I've got Savannah Hernandez and Owen Schroer who are on fire coming in here, and I have not even gotten to my top story yet.
[00:51:34.201 --> 00:51:38.242]  So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this right now.
[00:51:38.242 --> 00:51:40.443]  I'm going to mention this.
[00:51:40.443 --> 00:51:42.444]  I'm going to hit this coming out of the gates at 6 after.
[00:51:42.444 --> 00:51:43.864]  They'll be in studio with me.
[00:51:43.864 --> 00:51:46.605]  We'll talk about this at first, and we'll move into the subjects they're on.
[00:51:49.787 --> 00:52:00.310]  You understand I've got a stack of news articles and video clips where they're officially saying how they're going to have a coup against the president physically with the US military and how they're positioning it all.
[00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:06.471]  The last thing I need guys is the Goldman Sachs article where Goldman Sachs came out yesterday.
[00:52:06.471 --> 00:52:09.732]  Goldman Sachs says election will be contested.
[00:52:09.732 --> 00:52:10.252]  I need that please.
[00:52:10.252 --> 00:52:12.532]  It was a Reuters article.
[00:52:20.035 --> 00:52:22.656]  Oh man, I tell you, there's just so much of this.
[00:52:22.656 --> 00:52:25.297]  I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[00:52:25.297 --> 00:52:26.458]  So that's coming up.
[00:52:26.458 --> 00:52:29.699]  Briefly, you want to fund this operation.
[00:52:29.699 --> 00:52:32.460]  You want to get great products at the same time.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.861]  Now's the time to do it.
[00:52:34.861 --> 00:52:37.342]  A lot of products you like have not come back in.
[00:52:38.646 --> 00:52:40.687]  And people are like, where's my product?
[00:52:40.687 --> 00:52:50.014]  Well, with the exception of the toothpaste, the reason we aren't able to have it for you is because we have wildcrafted or organic quality and it's always hard to get it.
[00:52:50.014 --> 00:52:57.199]  And now because of breakdowns around the United States and a lot of these companies are partially shut down or fully shut down, everything's backed up and they're not even taking our money.
[00:52:58.038 --> 00:53:03.041]  And so the orders we are able to get in on some of our best products that were sold out are limited and aren't as big.
[00:53:03.041 --> 00:53:12.988]  And so that's why I've got to end this special by Sunday, Monday, the latest, because we're running out of these things that even came back in because we've got limited numbers and amounts of it.
[00:53:12.988 --> 00:53:20.133]  The July 4th Super Sale, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points that goes into your account on the next order, InfoWareStore.com.

[00:53:37.148 --> 00:53:38.789]  The Azobe, it's good for your whole body.
[00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:40.932]  Creates nitrous oxide in the blood.
[00:53:40.932 --> 00:53:44.756]  You know what that does, super high quality concentrate, 50% off.
[00:53:44.756 --> 00:53:48.400]  DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 and all things to clean out your

[00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:05.071]  We're good to go.
[00:54:23.004 --> 00:54:30.349]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can also go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the highest quality storable food now ready to ship within three to four weeks, but they've still got to package it.
[00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:35.413]  Whatever you do, get ready, get prepared now, because we're going into very uncertain times.
[00:54:35.413 --> 00:54:41.077]  As the lockdowns continue, it's going to be a total beyond depression breakdown of society.
[00:54:41.077 --> 00:54:42.958]  So we're fighting as hard as we can.
[00:54:42.958 --> 00:54:43.619]  Thank you for your support.
[00:54:44.861 --> 00:54:55.184]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[00:54:55.184 --> 00:54:59.866]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[00:55:00.566 --> 00:55:08.929]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[00:55:08.929 --> 00:55:28.817]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[00:55:29.457 --> 00:55:30.498]  Destinies.
[00:55:30.498 --> 00:55:37.421]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[00:55:37.421 --> 00:55:41.924]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[00:55:41.924 --> 00:55:44.025]  So take action, or be slaves!
[00:55:46.198 --> 00:55:53.321]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning, and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[00:55:53.321 --> 00:56:02.264]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese, walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[00:56:02.264 --> 00:56:07.026]  And here I am parked in a truck with the windows up, and the woman stops and points at me.
[00:56:07.026 --> 00:56:10.307]  So they stop, and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[00:56:10.307 --> 00:56:12.567]  Truck started, and they sit there and stretch.
[00:56:12.567 --> 00:56:13.348]  She keeps pointing.
[00:56:14.028 --> 00:56:16.043]  And they put their hands out like they're waiting for me.
[00:56:17.352 --> 00:56:21.795]  To go, because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:25.738]  And so then I just sat there, so they acted angry and walked past me.
[00:56:25.738 --> 00:56:31.102]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[00:56:31.102 --> 00:56:32.062]  This is mental illness.
[00:56:32.062 --> 00:56:35.645]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[00:56:35.645 --> 00:56:37.066]  This is all cult programming.
[00:56:37.066 --> 00:56:38.647]  This is all about submitting.
[00:56:38.647 --> 00:56:41.489]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[00:56:41.489 --> 00:56:42.870]  It's all a giant fraud.
[00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:45.172]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[00:56:48.784 --> 00:56:51.383]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:56:54.252 --> 00:57:15.547]  Frederick Douglass, Maryland-born slave, American free speech pioneer, a world-traveling order of abolition during the pre- and post-era of the Civil War, fought for both racial equality and women's suffrage, a path that led him to become America's first half-white, half-African American to run for Vice President of the United States.
[00:57:15.547 --> 00:57:19.450]  Douglass' Rochester, New York statue was recently torn down.
[00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:37.289]  Coincidentally, on the 168th anniversary of his What to the American Slave is Your 4th of July speech, as of this report, the morons that toppled the representation of everything Black Lives Matter claims to be have yet to be apprehended, and the motive still remains unclear.
[00:57:37.469 --> 00:57:50.594]  Could it be yet another Bubba Smollett race-baiting hit job, or is this another case of the millennial horde of imbeciles tearing down anything that represents some form of triggering pseudo-authority?
[00:57:50.594 --> 00:57:56.196]  And if this is a form of retaliation, judging by the drunk college students who did this back in 2018,
[00:57:57.236 --> 00:58:03.844]  The 6-foot-7-inch sculpture was ripped from its base at Tracy Street in Alexander shortly after midnight Sunday.
[00:58:03.844 --> 00:58:08.609]  A witness gave us cell phone video showing two men carrying that statue down the street.
[00:58:08.609 --> 00:58:09.130]  Two St.
[00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:11.813]  John Fisher College students were arrested.
[00:58:11.813 --> 00:58:15.417]  John Bodeker and Charles Milks charged with criminal mischief.
[00:58:15.757 --> 00:58:23.259]  Can we expect the gavel to fall harder on Americans after the Marxist Black Lives Matter set the stage?
[00:58:23.259 --> 00:58:29.921]  As is for the couple who are facing hate crime charges for daring to paint over the Black Lives mural in California.
[00:58:29.921 --> 00:58:35.362]  Will this path transform our court system into a communist-style Politburo?
[00:58:35.362 --> 00:58:39.063]  The statue pillaging is as confusing as it is stupid.
[00:58:39.063 --> 00:58:44.205]  But stupidity is law now, as the Democrats' defund movement shifts into high gear.
[00:58:44.625 --> 00:58:54.349]  They want to defund the police, but that's not stopping three city council members from having the city pay for their private security after receiving threats.
[00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:59.211]  A city spokesperson says the security details are costing the city $4,500 a day for a total of $63,000 for the last three weeks.
[00:59:04.153 --> 00:59:14.196]  In a text message, Council Member Cunningham said, I don't feel comfortable discussing the death threats against me or the level of security I currently have protecting me from those threats.
[00:59:14.196 --> 00:59:27.960]  Accelerating a lawlessness that is just showing the first signs of unyielding chaos as homicide skyrockets in New York with an increase in executions in broad daylight and more children are caught in the crossfire.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:37.545]  We're fighting the enemy within, when we are shooting each other up on our streets, in this city, and you shot and killed a baby.
[00:59:37.545 --> 00:59:46.870]  Sequoia Turner was shot near here, outside the Wendy's parking lot, where 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks was killed at the hands of a white police officer last month.
[00:59:47.176 --> 00:59:50.779]  We talk about Black Lives Matter, but at the end of the day, we're killing each other off.
[00:59:50.779 --> 00:59:52.201]  We're killing our babies.
[00:59:52.201 --> 00:59:57.946]  Another violent weekend, deadly for far too many and far too young.
[00:59:57.946 --> 00:59:59.127]  Jesus!
[00:59:59.127 --> 01:00:00.828]  Help us, Father!
[01:00:00.828 --> 01:00:08.756]  The grief-stricken family of 7-year-old Natalie Wallace shot in the head while playing outside in the yard of her grandmother's home in South Austin.
[01:00:09.116 --> 01:00:12.477]  But according to Don Lemon, their lives are a separate issue.
[01:00:25.601 --> 01:00:31.845]  And you're talking about even with the Atlanta child murders, there were 28 kids who died in two years.
[01:00:31.845 --> 01:00:41.192]  The gun culture in this country is prevalent, but I don't understand what that has to do with a movement that's for equality for black people.
[01:00:41.192 --> 01:00:44.194]  It's not mutually exclusive.
[01:00:44.194 --> 01:00:48.277]  If you care about equality for black people, that somehow you're going to stop
[01:00:49.097 --> 01:00:52.979]  As long as our economy and political systems prioritize profit,
[01:01:09.915 --> 01:01:18.978]  Without considering who is profiting, who is being shut out, we will perpetuate this inequality.
[01:01:18.978 --> 01:01:22.619]  So we cannot stop at criminal justice system.
[01:01:22.619 --> 01:01:29.001]  We must begin the work of dismantling the whole system of oppression wherever we find it.
[01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:46.606]  Frederick Douglass, who incisively spoke out against oppression during an era of real despotism, could have never imagined that his message would be forgotten and destroyed by people using their own claims of injustice to destroy themselves and everyone around them.
[01:01:46.606 --> 01:01:49.726]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:01:49.726 --> 01:01:50.787]  We'll be back!
[01:01:50.787 --> 01:01:51.307]  Stay with us!
[01:01:54.864 --> 01:02:06.590]  As we enter the critical month of July, it is very important for listeners and viewers to understand that all of the major storable food companies have been sold out of food for months.
[01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:15.354]  My Patriot Supply, our supplier, was out to an eight-week wait, not because they didn't have food, but because their four plants were backed up, packaging and getting it out.
[01:02:15.754 --> 01:02:19.437]  Now, they are at three to four weeks right now.
[01:02:19.437 --> 01:02:21.058]  They've gotten over the hump.
[01:02:21.058 --> 01:02:25.481]  Their other competitors are completely sold out or selling old garbage.
[01:02:25.481 --> 01:02:26.921]  This is high quality food.
[01:02:26.921 --> 01:02:33.126]  I would advise everyone to do what I'm doing and buy more storable food now before the next big hump comes.
[01:02:33.126 --> 01:02:36.808]  Because if you think things are about to settle down, think again.
[01:02:36.808 --> 01:02:38.970]  The world is only going to get more insane.
[01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:40.691]  I've been telling you this for six months.
[01:02:40.691 --> 01:02:43.873]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't have firearms and ammo and water filtration, you better get it.
[01:02:43.873 --> 01:02:45.634]  If you don't have storable food, you better get it.
[01:02:45.914 --> 01:02:50.019]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to take care of the water filtration and to take care of the storable foods.
[01:02:50.019 --> 01:02:52.001]  Get your orders in now before the next big rush!
[01:03:26.485 --> 01:03:39.154]  Let me ask you this, and I know this is a strange question to ask an American politician, maybe easier around the world, but have you ever considered what would happen if the election result came out as you being the winner and Trump refused to leave?
[01:03:39.154 --> 01:03:40.115]  Yes, I have.
[01:03:40.115 --> 01:03:41.296]  I was so damn proud.
[01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:47.140]  You have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:55.346]  And you have so many rank-and-file military personnel saying, whoa, we're not a military state, this is not who we are.
[01:03:55.962 --> 01:04:02.266]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.
[01:04:02.266 --> 01:04:20.057]  So we're not a military state, we're just a state where the WHO, the UN, and multinational corporations, and rogue states, and rogue mayors dictate to the President, to the courts, to the legislative branch, that we have no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:22.279]  And now the official Democrat Party platform
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.221]  is to abolish the U.S.
[01:04:26.221 --> 01:04:30.222]  and open us up to 600 million migrants with, quote, replacement migration.
[01:04:30.222 --> 01:04:31.963]  I'll show you those documents in a moment.
[01:04:31.963 --> 01:04:44.927]  But first, there is a major move in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Foreign Affairs of the CFR, across the country.
[01:04:44.927 --> 01:04:46.448]  Here's the headline from Infowars.com.
[01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:49.576]  Emergency global broadcast.
[01:04:49.576 --> 01:04:51.778]  Deep State announces new coup plot.
[01:04:51.778 --> 01:04:57.742]  Dem leaders in major publications saying military brass are preparing to remove Trump.
[01:04:57.742 --> 01:05:00.644]  Don't just believe info wars.
[01:05:00.644 --> 01:05:01.564]  Here it is.
[01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.685]  This is the latest.
[01:05:02.685 --> 01:05:05.987]  Military would escort Trump from the White House.
[01:05:05.987 --> 01:05:07.008]  Here's another one.
[01:05:07.008 --> 01:05:08.189]  CNBC.
[01:05:08.189 --> 01:05:14.493]  Goldman warns delayed election results this November similar to Bush-Gore could rock the market and predict
[01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:24.436]  There's going to be delayed issues because the Democrats are trying all this criminal fraud, all these mail-in ballots, and they say they're going to contest it if Trump wins.
[01:05:24.436 --> 01:05:34.861]  So it's going to be contested, and then when Trump contests what they're saying, they're setting the stage that the military will remove the president.
[01:05:34.861 --> 01:05:35.982]  Here's the latest.
[01:05:35.982 --> 01:05:41.785]  Trump could lose and not leave, but cabinet members who try to help him face prison.
[01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:46.565]  This is a syndicated column in newspapers all over the country.
[01:05:46.565 --> 01:05:51.612]  This came out of the stamfordadvocate.com.
[01:05:51.612 --> 01:05:53.935]  And it says November is approaching fast.
[01:05:57.571 --> 01:06:21.178]  And it's a whole group of people, again from the Washington Post, where this article originated from, saying that people better not support Trump if he challenges the results, even though Democrats are going to challenge it if he wins, and that they are prepared with the military to remove Trump, this is all part of their bravado, preparing everyone, acting powerful, claiming the military's behind them, just some shadowy group, and that
[01:06:23.382 --> 01:06:32.290]  Anyone that aids him and speaks out and says that he's right, you will be arrested for your speech.
[01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:44.620]  And if you complain about the Democratic Party's new platform, saying they're going to replace Americans with migrants, 600 million, replacement migration now part of the Democrat platform, Biden officially signed on to it last night.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:48.503]  Sacha Baron Cohen and the ADL say you will be purged.
[01:06:49.437 --> 01:06:50.597]  And you will be arrested.
[01:06:50.597 --> 01:06:51.618]  We played the clip yesterday.
[01:06:51.618 --> 01:06:58.719]  So, they're now saying, we're gonna arrest you if you don't let us take the country over.
[01:06:58.719 --> 01:07:06.501]  With Novemberfest approaching, here's a recurring question that can't easily be dismissed as alarmist fretting or grim humor.
[01:07:06.501 --> 01:07:12.103]  What if President Trump loses his bid for re-election, but refuses to concede and instead clings to power?
[01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:21.272]  That means, oh, it's preposterous that he'd win, and if there's any questions and he challenges it like 2000, well, we can't do it.
[01:07:21.272 --> 01:07:22.474]  And they go on in the article.
[01:07:22.474 --> 01:07:33.107]  It's a long article to say the military is ready and that he will be arrested, but also anyone else that does not go along with it, anyone on his cabinet.
[01:07:35.387 --> 01:07:40.951]  That if they believe the election has been stolen and they speak out against it, that they will be charged.
[01:07:40.951 --> 01:08:01.764]  And then they talk about, there's also, specific to the military, that demand obedience to one only legitimate president, under one provision, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, executing order under someone who's not a lawful president, could be deemed to have failed to do his utmost to prevent and suppress mutiny or sedition being committed in his presence.
[01:08:01.764 --> 01:08:03.645]  The same provision criminalizes
[01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:07.398]  Even attempting mutiny or sedition.
[01:08:07.398 --> 01:08:16.322]  Moreover, another statutory provision criminalizes soliciting or advising the commission of mutinies.
[01:08:16.322 --> 01:08:17.463]  Did you hear that?
[01:08:17.463 --> 01:08:29.909]  So if you argue that Trump really won, and there's fraud, and the Supreme Court should challenge this, they've already laid out how they're telling the military and others, if you stand with the President, you're going to go to jail.
[01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:32.918]  They're the ones preparing the mutiny.
[01:08:32.918 --> 01:08:36.682]  They're the ones saying we want a depression and COVID-19 to shut things down.
[01:08:36.682 --> 01:08:40.686]  They're the ones with fake testing numbers to jack up the numbers and create fear.
[01:08:40.686 --> 01:08:42.808]  They're the ones saying we want a depression.
[01:08:42.808 --> 01:08:45.030]  They're the ones saying they hate the American flag.
[01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:48.273]  They're the ones saying they hate the existence of the very country.
[01:08:48.273 --> 01:08:49.294]  You gotta go read it.
[01:08:49.294 --> 01:08:51.957]  It's a long article and I've got a bunch of other ones here.
[01:08:51.957 --> 01:08:52.838]  Look at this one.
[01:08:52.838 --> 01:08:55.681]  This is from the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:08:57.808 --> 01:09:00.049]  America's democratic unraveling.
[01:09:00.049 --> 01:09:04.151]  Notice, they create the mutiny, say Trump's creating a mutiny.
[01:09:04.151 --> 01:09:08.493]  They create the unraveling, admit they're doing it, then say, oh, Trump's doing it.
[01:09:08.493 --> 01:09:09.253]  And it says right here.
[01:09:10.711 --> 01:09:21.919]  That because Trump has caused the unraveling, the armed forces may be able to restrain him as well, as evidenced by the forceful rebuke he received from former Defense Secretary James Mattis over threatening to deploy U.S.
[01:09:21.919 --> 01:09:24.081]  Army and National Guard against protesters.
[01:09:24.081 --> 01:09:25.622]  They weren't protesters, they were looters.
[01:09:25.622 --> 01:09:30.646]  But it would be a sad day in America if he had to depend on the military to save our democracy.
[01:09:31.323 --> 01:09:33.925]  And they go on to talk about the military removing him.
[01:09:33.925 --> 01:09:38.189]  Savannah Hernandez, our great reporter, and of course, Owen Schroer, hosting The Worm, are both here.
[01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:44.395]  We're going to cover other subjects when we come back, but right now, Owen, give us a minute or two on what you think about this situation.
[01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:49.800]  They're preparing the groundwork for the open mutiny coup, and then saying it's Trump's fault, inverting reality.
[01:09:50.919 --> 01:09:56.142]  I think they've lost confidence in the censorship in the media.
[01:09:56.142 --> 01:10:00.405]  They see the real polls that have Trump, I don't know how far ahead of Biden.
[01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:03.627]  Biden really has no support, it's just Trump versus anti-Trump at this point.
[01:10:03.627 --> 01:10:07.750]  He's the placeholder for the coup to remove Trump, overthrow the country, and then put it in whoever they want.
[01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:14.494]  So they obviously think that their just blatant election fraud isn't going to work, so they're getting ready to kind of unveil this plan.
[01:10:14.494 --> 01:10:15.755]  What I think they may do though,
[01:10:16.872 --> 01:10:27.820]  They may have television media come on the night of the election and say, oh Biden won, Biden won, even though Trump did win, and they'll just have the whole censorship grid rolled out just like they did with COVID.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:34.044]  They'll stop, just like they stop any doctors from talking about hydroxychloroquine, or stop any doctors from talking about the fake test results.
[01:10:34.044 --> 01:10:34.564]  Exactly.
[01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:39.328]  This has all been a dress rehearsal for stealing the election and having big tech AI totally suppress it all.
[01:10:39.628 --> 01:10:44.852]  And then so they'll come in and they'll say, oh, Biden won, Biden won, and then Trump will say, no, Biden didn't win.
[01:10:44.852 --> 01:10:46.813]  Then it'll be the president versus the media.
[01:10:46.813 --> 01:10:48.374]  Just that'll be the playing field.
[01:10:48.374 --> 01:10:52.517]  You know, our question now, Alex, is we basically have three options.
[01:10:52.517 --> 01:10:54.158]  One option is attack.
[01:10:54.158 --> 01:11:00.943]  And I mean, literally, like it's time to mount up and we'll go make our own autonomous zone and we'll drag these Democrats out by the scruff of their neck.
[01:11:00.943 --> 01:11:03.244]  Yeah, the autonomous zones will be inside the Capitol.
[01:11:03.244 --> 01:11:03.764]  Yeah.
[01:11:03.764 --> 01:11:04.485]  And so that's one.
[01:11:04.485 --> 01:11:05.125]  We can attack.
[01:11:05.125 --> 01:11:05.706]  We can do that.
[01:11:05.706 --> 01:11:07.187]  Two is patience.
[01:11:07.187 --> 01:11:08.528]  We can sit back and wait.
[01:11:09.108 --> 01:11:16.673]  And see, okay, let's see what happens in the election night, let's hope for a good thing, maybe a big red wave, a bunch of patriots get into Congress, and we can actually do this peacefully and politically.
[01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:18.474]  And then the third option is retreat!
[01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:24.738]  Go to the hills, mount up, get emergency food, get by body water, get by, you know, a mountain, get a bunch of guns and ammo.
[01:11:24.738 --> 01:11:25.999]  Well, I'm doing both!
[01:11:25.999 --> 01:11:35.825]  So, so, but I guess the philosophical thing we have to wonder now is, for example, if we want to attack, or if we want to wait, or like, at what point do we measure
[01:11:37.048 --> 01:11:39.672]  At what point do we have to choose before we've had the choices taken?
[01:11:39.672 --> 01:11:46.481]  Or is it, okay, if Trump wants to let them steal the election from Trump, okay fine, that's Trump's decision.
[01:11:46.481 --> 01:11:49.045]  We're not going to let them take our country.
[01:11:49.045 --> 01:11:52.189]  So... They've already told us the contact tracers are coming to our houses.
[01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:54.771]  And they go, oh, by the way, they're going to be political.
[01:11:54.771 --> 01:11:56.591]  They're the youth brigades Obama wanted.
[01:11:56.591 --> 01:11:57.772]  This is their whole rollout.
[01:11:57.772 --> 01:11:58.932]  Hey, we want to be on the field.
[01:11:58.932 --> 01:11:59.993]  We want to be on the front lines.
[01:11:59.993 --> 01:12:00.953]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:12:00.953 --> 01:12:02.373]  Trump has let them censor us.
[01:12:02.373 --> 01:12:04.734]  Trump has let them lie about us, sue us into submission.
[01:12:04.734 --> 01:12:05.495]  We're still fighting.
[01:12:05.495 --> 01:12:10.516]  So, hey, you know, at the end of the day, are we fighting for Trump or are we fighting for America?
[01:12:10.516 --> 01:12:11.357]  I'm fighting for America.
[01:12:11.357 --> 01:12:11.977]  Let's be clear.
[01:12:11.977 --> 01:12:13.798]  But Trump is there for us.
[01:12:13.798 --> 01:12:14.598]  He's doing a great job.
[01:12:14.598 --> 01:12:16.399]  But, Owen, all the points you made are great.
[01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:16.959]  But at the end,
[01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.551]  It doesn't matter.
[01:12:18.551 --> 01:12:19.671]  We're under a globalist attack.
[01:12:19.671 --> 01:12:20.432]  We've just got to fight.
[01:12:20.432 --> 01:12:23.494]  I want to hear what Savannah Hernandez thinks about this when we come back and get into other big subjects.
[01:12:23.494 --> 01:12:25.316]  But when you were saying that, it just hit me.
[01:12:25.316 --> 01:12:29.920]  We've got to hammer this every day for the next 115 days so America knows this is coming.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:39.627]  Because the Democrats in all their elitist publications are preparing for the coup and saying they're doing it and saying they're going to challenge the election, but Trump isn't allowed to.
[01:12:39.627 --> 01:12:42.590]  And they're going to arrest people across the board that don't submit.
[01:12:43.968 --> 01:12:46.769]  We'll talk about this with Savannah Hernandez and Owen Shorter straight ahead.
[01:12:46.769 --> 01:12:47.629]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.250]  There couldn't be a more important subject.
[01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:52.691]  Tell folks to tune into your local radio stations right now.
[01:12:52.691 --> 01:12:58.273]  I am cutting this ad on Friday, and by Monday afternoon, we have to end this special.
[01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:06.835]  Because even though a lot of these items have been sold out and just came back in, we only ordered a limited amount of things like bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:13:06.835 --> 01:13:11.657]  Because quite frankly, the supply chain has broken down with COVID-19, and a lot of products
[01:13:12.017 --> 01:13:17.501]  We've been unable to even get back in stock because the companies we get them from are partially shut down.
[01:13:17.501 --> 01:13:18.742]  This is totally crazy.
[01:13:18.742 --> 01:13:29.189]  So you've got just a few days left to take advantage of the July 4th mega sale with storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, and up to 60% off on high quality products.
[01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:30.270]  DNA Force Plus, 50% off.
[01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:32.791]  I must end this special, our extended July 4th special, by Monday the 12th.
[01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:34.031]  That is our drop dead date.
[01:14:00.623 --> 01:14:09.412]  It absolutely has to happen because a lot of these products that have been sold out, we can only get limited supplies of them because the supply chain is breaking down.
[01:14:09.412 --> 01:14:14.578]  Winter Sun with vitamin D3 and vitamin K, sold out for months, back in stock, 50% off.
[01:14:14.578 --> 01:14:16.480]  Ultra 12, high quality B12, take another tongue.
[01:14:16.963 --> 01:14:17.223]  I think so.
[01:14:39.704 --> 01:14:42.465]  They don't want you to know what God has given us all through mother nature.
[01:14:42.465 --> 01:14:43.845]  These products are powerful.
[01:14:43.845 --> 01:14:45.926]  Many of you have tried them and reordered them and loved them.
[01:14:45.926 --> 01:14:46.766]  Many of you haven't.
[01:14:46.766 --> 01:14:54.308]  The sale ends in just a few days, so take action now and get free shipping at importwarrestore.com.
[01:14:54.308 --> 01:14:56.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:14.147 --> 01:15:16.329]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:16.329 --> 01:15:21.394]  And we talk about a subject like this, we start talking fast, we start hyperventilating, because we're not reading off teleprompters.
[01:15:21.394 --> 01:15:33.465]  We're reading out of the Washington Post, saying the president's going to be removed from office if he challenges the election in any way, even though the Democrats say they're going to challenge it and are involved in massive fraud.
[01:15:33.465 --> 01:15:37.809]  And the military will be arrested if they don't follow Democrats' orders to arrest the president.
[01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:42.558]  So this is a constitutional crisis.
[01:15:42.558 --> 01:15:43.900]  Savannah Hernandez is here with us.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.121]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:45.121 --> 01:15:52.126]  I wanted to get you guys in here about all the SJW activity and Owen going down to the Austin City Council yesterday where they're doing $2,000 fines.
[01:15:52.126 --> 01:15:57.331]  They've announced the lockdown of the city to begin within the next week until at least December 31st.
[01:15:57.331 --> 01:15:58.852]  That hasn't been really announced yet.
[01:15:58.852 --> 01:15:59.853]  It's in the fine print.
[01:16:00.353 --> 01:16:04.174]  Also, they're announcing to wear masks inside your house statewide.
[01:16:04.174 --> 01:16:06.395]  This is just total cult level takeover.
[01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:09.656]  Governor Abbott has totally smoked Soros, you in dope.
[01:16:09.656 --> 01:16:11.096]  We'll talk about that next segment.
[01:16:11.096 --> 01:16:17.439]  But Savannah Hernandez looking at them openly after the fake Russiagate, trying to block him being inaugurated.
[01:16:19.439 --> 01:16:25.640]  Rapegate, the fake Ukrainegate, all of this insane crap, the massive censorship, all of it.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.321]  Where do you think this country's going with 115 days?
[01:16:28.321 --> 01:16:32.021]  What do we do to beat the drum to expose this plan they've got?
[01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:36.902]  I mean, coming out on air and exposing all of this and talking about it is a great way to do that, Alex.
[01:16:36.902 --> 01:16:42.083]  And I'm glad that you have the platform now to be able to do that, to expose this information.
[01:16:42.083 --> 01:16:44.103]  Well, the listeners have the platform if they promote it.
[01:16:44.103 --> 01:16:44.983]  Right, definitely.
[01:16:44.983 --> 01:16:47.744]  And you know, they've been laying the groundwork.
[01:16:48.024 --> 01:16:48.164]  Yes.
[01:17:05.848 --> 01:17:06.328]  I think so.
[01:17:26.574 --> 01:17:27.034]  Exactly.
[01:17:27.034 --> 01:17:28.854]  We're 115 days out.
[01:17:28.854 --> 01:17:30.055]  They're going to do it.
[01:17:30.055 --> 01:17:34.616]  They've beta-tested, as Owen rightly said, this COVID lockdown of information.
[01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:35.716]  It is a total test.
[01:17:35.716 --> 01:17:39.597]  And they're saying, you're not allowed to say voter fraud exists even if you catch it.
[01:17:39.597 --> 01:17:40.517]  So they're going to deny it.
[01:17:40.517 --> 01:17:42.237]  They're going to deny the mail-in fraud.
[01:17:42.237 --> 01:17:44.557]  They're going to deny all sorts of shenanigans in other states.
[01:17:44.557 --> 01:17:48.618]  They're saying they're going to let states just say, we're going with popular vote.
[01:17:48.618 --> 01:17:52.399]  If Trump challenges that, even if the Constitution says that's it, they're going to try to block it.
[01:17:52.679 --> 01:17:56.324]  And you even see the Supreme Court now suddenly ruling against him a whole bunch.
[01:17:56.324 --> 01:17:58.667]  You suddenly see the generals talking trash about him.
[01:17:58.667 --> 01:18:01.211]  They intend to remove Trump in 115 days.
[01:18:01.211 --> 01:18:02.612]  Remember, I told you he was going to win.
[01:18:02.612 --> 01:18:05.757]  And he's going to really win the real vote in 115 days, folks.
[01:18:05.757 --> 01:18:09.962]  But I think they're going to remove him by coup unless we admit that they're coming with the coup.
[01:18:09.962 --> 01:18:10.263]  Savannah?
[01:18:11.004 --> 01:18:11.784]  I completely agree.
[01:18:11.784 --> 01:18:15.346]  And I mean, this has happened time and time again, just like you talked about with Russian collusion.
[01:18:15.346 --> 01:18:20.228]  This has been an attack on the president since the day since before he even got into office.
[01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:26.550]  So, you know, we're seeing this amp up because, as you've clearly seen, Joe Biden cannot even form a coherent sentence.
[01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:28.271]  They have nothing to go on.
[01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:33.053]  And now they're just actively trying to push the president out because that's really all they can do at this point.
[01:18:33.053 --> 01:18:34.234]  And then there'll be a panel.
[01:18:35.256 --> 01:18:40.518]  And an emergency congressional hearing, and then they will select who the new president is.
[01:18:40.518 --> 01:18:41.398]  They want this on purpose.
[01:18:41.398 --> 01:18:46.500]  Just like before they had a pope for life, then it was predicted there would be two popes, now they're saying there might be three popes.
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:50.101]  They want to get rid, all over the place, of anything traditional.
[01:18:50.101 --> 01:19:00.805]  But here in America, they want to get rid, again, of the president really being elected, have a big commission, have a big crisis, and then have constitutional amendment to get rid of the electoral college and bring in a new
[01:19:01.505 --> 01:19:04.271]  ...presidential type system that's more parliamentary.
[01:19:04.271 --> 01:19:06.455]  They're gonna gut the country all right now.
[01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:09.100]  Whether Trump wins or loses, the main assault is here.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:09.240]  Owen?
[01:19:10.316 --> 01:19:11.416]  Well, the coup is on.
[01:19:11.416 --> 01:19:15.518]  I mean, I don't think anybody denies the coup, whether you're in on the coup or against the coup.
[01:19:15.518 --> 01:19:22.101]  You're either with the coup, because you say Trump's a Nazi or racist or whatever, so, oh, we're justified in removing him from office or killing him.
[01:19:22.101 --> 01:19:30.004]  And then if you're a Trump supporter, you say, look at all the lies about Trump, look at the lies about his crowd size, look at the lies about his past, look at the lies about what he says.
[01:19:30.004 --> 01:19:32.045]  So, there's no doubt the coup is on.
[01:19:32.045 --> 01:19:32.645]  Again, I mean, I...
[01:19:33.425 --> 01:19:36.467]  Alex, I just get frustrated because it's like we know who did the coup.
[01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:38.969]  We have the 20 to 30 names who did it.
[01:19:38.969 --> 01:19:41.331]  And they've already had failed coups caught red-handed.
[01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:42.572]  They didn't get in trouble.
[01:19:42.572 --> 01:19:46.214]  And so if Berman and people don't start arresting people last month, we're done.
[01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:47.295]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:19:47.295 --> 01:19:52.799]  It's like arrests need to happen before the election or we're going to face a real coup.
[01:19:52.799 --> 01:19:54.641]  And I'm afraid it's going to be a war.
[01:19:54.641 --> 01:19:55.962]  I really am afraid of that.
[01:19:56.582 --> 01:20:02.105]  I don't think the average leftist that we'll play clips of from a rally we had earlier this week.
[01:20:02.105 --> 01:20:03.326]  The average leftist is not my enemy.
[01:20:03.326 --> 01:20:04.507]  They're a brainwashed fool.
[01:20:04.507 --> 01:20:04.927]  They couldn't even...
[01:20:05.772 --> 01:20:10.973]  You know, tell the real story of America if they, you know, went to college or whatever.
[01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:14.013]  They think Frederick Douglass was a white supremacist.
[01:20:14.013 --> 01:20:22.955]  They think Orwell, major leftist publications are calling for him to have his books banned because he, quote, didn't like communists, so that means he's a Nazi.
[01:20:22.955 --> 01:20:34.837]  He was in the Spanish Civil War and shot by Nazis through the throat and almost killed, but he was there in Spain around the communists and saw them being as bad as the Nazis, so 1984 was about how Stalin
[01:20:35.117 --> 01:20:36.458]  Was as bad as the Nazis.
[01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:41.402]  So you're shot fighting real Nazis and the Antifa gets to say you're a Nazi.
[01:20:41.402 --> 01:20:45.585]  It's all about them being God, them being the boss, and all of us they're slaves.
[01:20:45.585 --> 01:20:47.026]  That's what it is.
[01:20:47.026 --> 01:20:49.948]  We've been, in fact Alex you called out the coup before anybody else.
[01:20:49.948 --> 01:20:53.651]  It was literally election night and people didn't understand what you meant when you said it's gonna get worse.
[01:20:53.651 --> 01:20:54.392]  Well this is what he meant.
[01:20:55.112 --> 01:20:57.533]  And I'll be honest, Alex, I think about this.
[01:20:57.533 --> 01:21:13.938]  I think about, you know, is it time for Alex Jones and Infowars to declare war on the deep state and literally say, OK, if we don't have arrests by October 31st, 2020, we call for 50,000 armed men to meet us at the Texas Capitol and we'll set up our own autonomous zone.
[01:21:14.338 --> 01:21:22.624]  And we'll go wherever we need to go and drag out whoever we need to drag out by the scuff of their neck until we start to get some arrest or we start to get some action.
[01:21:22.624 --> 01:21:23.585]  I don't want to do that.
[01:21:23.585 --> 01:21:24.926]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:21:24.926 --> 01:21:26.867]  That's why we take political action.
[01:21:26.867 --> 01:21:28.929]  That's why we come on air every day.
[01:21:28.929 --> 01:21:32.291]  But it's reaching a point where, yeah, there's an active coup going on.
[01:21:32.291 --> 01:21:34.032]  It's been going on for four years.
[01:21:34.032 --> 01:21:37.195]  People should be hanging from ropes for treason right now.
[01:21:37.195 --> 01:21:38.455]  This is getting out of control.
[01:21:38.455 --> 01:21:40.477]  And by the way, we're not up here lined up and shot.
[01:21:40.817 --> 01:21:44.519]  We're not up here in camo acting tough about how we're going to have a war with the U.N.
[01:21:44.519 --> 01:21:45.100]  and all this.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.080]  We're already under U.N.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:46.521]  control.
[01:21:46.521 --> 01:21:53.045]  We're already under Global's control, but we've got pockets of America left, and people have to decide what they're going to do.
[01:21:53.045 --> 01:21:57.047]  I'm just simply telling everybody, when they take Trump out, he's right.
[01:21:57.047 --> 01:21:59.529]  He said, look, they don't really hate me, they hate you.
[01:21:59.529 --> 01:22:01.050]  I'm just standing in their way.
[01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:03.531]  That's really what's going on here, okay?
[01:22:03.531 --> 01:22:04.612]  And Trump is surrounded.
[01:22:04.612 --> 01:22:06.173]  I'm surprised he's done this much good.
[01:22:06.173 --> 01:22:06.973]  I love him.
[01:22:06.973 --> 01:22:07.734]  He's the real deal.
[01:22:09.048 --> 01:22:16.692]  Everybody else is being threatened with arrest or imprisonment or have had the FBI visit them because Trump still doesn't have control of the Justice Department.
[01:22:16.692 --> 01:22:22.314]  And so other people, when they get the visits or the threats, they turn against the president because they're under duress.
[01:22:22.314 --> 01:22:24.535]  Why do you think all these big sites have turned against the president?
[01:22:24.535 --> 01:22:26.076]  Because they have a gun to their head.
[01:22:26.076 --> 01:22:27.117]  They put the gun to my head.
[01:22:27.117 --> 01:22:28.817]  I said, pull the trigger.
[01:22:28.817 --> 01:22:30.358]  Most people don't do that.
[01:22:30.358 --> 01:22:32.019]  Roger Stone said, pull the trigger.
[01:22:32.019 --> 01:22:33.600]  They're trying to put him in prison.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.041]  By the way, I know whether Trump's giving him a pardon or not.
[01:22:37.041 --> 01:22:37.902]  I've been asked not to say.
[01:22:38.482 --> 01:22:41.364]  I'll just tell you, the Drudge Report headline's very accurate right now.
[01:22:41.364 --> 01:22:42.925]  You put it back on screen?
[01:22:42.925 --> 01:22:44.486]  Developing Trump to pardon Stone.
[01:22:44.486 --> 01:22:46.107]  Well, yeah.
[01:22:46.107 --> 01:22:52.111]  Yeah, you see, I love how I always have to wait and I don't get to break stuff even though I know it a week ago.
[01:22:52.111 --> 01:22:55.473]  I mean, as of a week ago, Trump is going to pardon the president.
[01:22:55.473 --> 01:22:58.114]  But, I mean, Trump is going to pardon Stone.
[01:22:58.114 --> 01:22:59.715]  It just makes my head want to explode.
[01:22:59.715 --> 01:23:01.196]  I just cannot handle this anymore.
[01:23:01.196 --> 01:23:02.677]  It's unbelievable.
[01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.519]  And they act like the conviction of
[01:23:05.519 --> 01:23:07.280]  Stone validates Russiagate.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.381]  There's no Russiagate there.
[01:23:09.381 --> 01:23:10.441]  And the left knows that.
[01:23:10.441 --> 01:23:12.802]  You're the stinkers that hate the country.
[01:23:12.802 --> 01:23:15.063]  Can you imagine if the left actually ran this nation?
[01:23:15.063 --> 01:23:16.083]  They're never gonna run it.
[01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:20.585]  You're being used as the scum to overthrow the country, and then you're gonna be put on lockdown, dumbasses.
[01:23:20.585 --> 01:23:22.006]  Yeah, how long did CHOP last?
[01:23:22.006 --> 01:23:22.526]  Two weeks?
[01:23:22.526 --> 01:23:23.006]  Three weeks?
[01:23:23.006 --> 01:23:24.487]  That's about how long their reign would last.
[01:23:25.916 --> 01:23:26.376]  Maybe less.
[01:23:49.950 --> 01:24:03.730]  It's the end of the world as we know it It's the end of the world as we know it It's the end of the world as we know it And I feel fine
[01:24:05.891 --> 01:24:10.513]  It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.
[01:24:10.513 --> 01:24:21.556]  This entire takeover has been battle-planned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:23.637]  This is the post-human takeover.
[01:24:23.637 --> 01:24:27.318]  The noose gets tighter when you comply, not looser.
[01:24:28.118 --> 01:24:31.120]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.462]  Now they admit that, quote, death numbers are dropping because those are fake.
[01:24:34.462 --> 01:24:36.403]  Or they count people that died of something else.
[01:24:36.403 --> 01:24:38.204]  But it's all about how many cases there are.
[01:24:38.204 --> 01:24:42.026]  And now they're saying, most of the population will get it.
[01:24:42.026 --> 01:24:44.547]  And then no one can go outside ever again.
[01:24:44.547 --> 01:24:46.689]  It's totally insane.
[01:24:46.689 --> 01:24:47.829]  It's a fraud.
[01:24:47.829 --> 01:24:48.710]  It's all a lie.

[01:27:05.939 --> 01:27:08.620]  One last breath, the four wind blows.
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.560]  Better raise your ears.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.021]  As the sound of hooves knock at your door.
[01:27:13.021 --> 01:27:14.181]  Big Brother.
[01:27:14.181 --> 01:27:15.982]  Mainstream media.
[01:27:15.982 --> 01:27:17.882]  Government cover-ups.
[01:27:17.882 --> 01:27:19.563]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:27:19.563 --> 01:27:21.223]  Well, so does he.
[01:27:21.223 --> 01:27:26.305]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:27:26.305 --> 01:27:26.925]  Alright, folks.
[01:27:28.058 --> 01:27:31.761]  We are here with Savannah Hernandez and Owen Schroyer.
[01:27:31.761 --> 01:27:33.463]  All the cameras aimed in close on me.
[01:27:33.463 --> 01:27:35.925]  The most boring thing to watch.
[01:27:35.925 --> 01:27:37.926]  And we're talking about how real this is.
[01:27:37.926 --> 01:27:45.473]  The whole world history is about coups and counter-coups and empires being overthrown and republics being overthrown and wars.
[01:27:45.473 --> 01:27:50.097]  And you look at what's happening, it's all being run against us for real.
[01:27:50.097 --> 01:27:53.380]  Because Americans have had so much freedom and been so soft for so long.
[01:27:55.287 --> 01:28:10.570]  We are literally watching the Supreme Court line up against the President, the Pentagon signaling against the President, because these people are all hedging their bets that if it looks like Trump loses, even if it's fraudulent, they're going to hang him out to dry.
[01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:12.791]  Because they want to be there when the country gets carved up.
[01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:16.111]  They want money.
[01:28:16.111 --> 01:28:18.192]  And so countries like this don't
[01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:22.372]  Die over long periods of time.
[01:28:22.372 --> 01:28:26.355]  They get sick over long periods of time and rot and then they die.
[01:28:26.355 --> 01:28:30.739]  You go off a cliff and there's a sudden collapse and you get sacked and you get ruined.
[01:28:30.739 --> 01:28:34.703]  After a while the barbarians wander off and an outside empire comes in and takes over.
[01:28:34.703 --> 01:28:36.845]  This is the end of the country, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:38.226 --> 01:28:39.507]  You have to understand that.
[01:28:39.507 --> 01:28:51.473]  The globalists will shut off the central cities, shut down the highways, and they'll wait a year or two, like they did with the Russians, until you starve to death, until you accept the central control of the globalist communists.
[01:28:51.473 --> 01:28:57.036]  And you're going to have ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center-trained people in your house every week.
[01:28:57.036 --> 01:29:00.357]  You're going to have your families put into apartment buildings with other families.
[01:29:00.357 --> 01:29:02.278]  They're going to watch everything you do.
[01:29:02.278 --> 01:29:05.180]  This is the dream of these globalists.
[01:29:06.334 --> 01:29:13.507]  And so, you need to understand they want to break you, they think you're weak, and they're coming for you.
[01:29:13.507 --> 01:29:15.531]  Savannah Hernandez, more comments on this situation.
[01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:39.659]  No, Alex, I've only been following politics for the past two years, but everything that you've talked about, I mean, has come true, and you've been ahead of the time, you've been ahead of the curve time and time again, and I just hope that people listen to you and they put out the message that you're getting across because, like we've talked about, they've been attacking President Trump since before he's even been in office, and they've been laying down the groundwork, and we're seeing it time and time again, and
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.042]  You know, 2020 isn't going to get any calmer.
[01:29:43.042 --> 01:29:52.851]  Everyone keeps waiting for it to calm down and it's not going to calm down because, you know, up in November we have this election and no matter what the outcome is, it's going to be a fight either way, so.
[01:29:54.226 --> 01:29:56.767]  Because the people running the attack never get in trouble.
[01:29:56.767 --> 01:29:59.909]  The people up on top, the foreign banks, the CHICOMs, they never pay.
[01:29:59.909 --> 01:30:01.870]  But Trump's starting to actually make them pay.
[01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:04.531]  I mean, pulling out of the WHO, shutting down China.
[01:30:04.531 --> 01:30:06.052]  I mean, Trump's swinging for the fences.
[01:30:06.052 --> 01:30:06.792]  He's fighting hard.
[01:30:06.792 --> 01:30:11.414]  I mean, if this was a Godzilla movie, Godzilla's like, just threw Megalon, you know, into the ocean.
[01:30:11.414 --> 01:30:12.435]  I mean, he's fighting.
[01:30:13.171 --> 01:30:19.575]  Yeah, the problem is if they install Biden or, you know, he would just be a placeholder for whoever they bring in after that.
[01:30:19.575 --> 01:30:21.056]  Oh, that's a Chinese dictatorship.
[01:30:21.056 --> 01:30:25.659]  They'll just... He said in a video two years ago that we need to be under Chinese rule.
[01:30:25.659 --> 01:30:26.340]  Sorry.
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:32.063]  They'll literally put us right back in the WHO, they'll sign us right back in the TPP, they'll sign us right back in the Paris Climate Accord.
[01:30:32.063 --> 01:30:32.344]  So, I mean...
[01:30:32.924 --> 01:30:35.486]  Look, Trump needs to deal a death blow to the deep state.
[01:30:35.486 --> 01:30:37.887]  He needs to deal a death blow to the globalists.
[01:30:37.887 --> 01:30:40.209]  And that's arresting their heads in the West.
[01:30:40.209 --> 01:30:44.051]  I mean, that's just the most peaceful way to do this, in my view.
[01:30:44.051 --> 01:30:56.059]  Because, like you said, if we have a massive victory, which I would expect for Trump, maybe not as massive as we'd hope, but I think the real polls and the just turnout for rallies indicate anything, not the fake TV polls.
[01:30:56.059 --> 01:30:57.320]  It's that, yeah, Trump is still ahead.
[01:30:58.621 --> 01:30:59.982]  Now the left is going after their own.
[01:30:59.982 --> 01:31:04.524]  I mean, there's protests calling for governors and mayors to resign in all these left-run cities.
[01:31:04.524 --> 01:31:05.764]  They're Democrats!
[01:31:05.764 --> 01:31:06.985]  They're all Democrats!
[01:31:06.985 --> 01:31:10.926]  There's rallies outside of Democrat mansions all across.
[01:31:10.926 --> 01:31:11.326]  That's right.
[01:31:11.326 --> 01:31:16.709]  They want to bring the whole country down because they're going down, and they want to then reorganize it in a Marshall Plan.
[01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:17.089]  And by the way,
[01:31:18.507 --> 01:31:24.279]  When I talk about Biden openly saying we need to be run by China, they found the article with the video, put it back on screen.
[01:31:24.279 --> 01:31:25.723]  I know this sounds insane.
[01:31:25.723 --> 01:31:26.965]  I know it sounds crazy.
[01:31:26.965 --> 01:31:28.308]  This is what a takeover looks like.
[01:31:29.315 --> 01:31:36.439]  Flashback, Biden calls for communist Chinese influence in quote, all levels of government classrooms and boardrooms.
[01:31:36.439 --> 01:31:39.581]  That was back under Obama during the ongoing takeover.
[01:31:39.581 --> 01:31:40.942]  They had sold us out.
[01:31:40.942 --> 01:31:45.865]  But in the last minute, the people of the Republic elected Trump and stuck our foot in the door.
[01:31:45.865 --> 01:31:54.351]  And that's why the Washington Post is telling the military, if you stand with Trump when we try to steal the election and he contested, we're going to arrest you.
[01:31:55.367 --> 01:31:58.352]  And the military's like, well, we'll fight this.
[01:31:58.352 --> 01:32:01.236]  The top brass are scum.
[01:32:01.236 --> 01:32:03.841]  So remember that, and just this last point.
[01:32:05.433 --> 01:32:12.557]  It's three big brokerage firms, the big mutual funds, and five banks, okay?
[01:32:12.557 --> 01:32:16.700]  All Trump has to do is actually get control of the Justice Department.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:17.900]  They have all the dirt.
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:20.242]  All you do is arrest those people right now.
[01:32:20.242 --> 01:32:22.123]  The whole thing will roll over just like that.
[01:32:22.123 --> 01:32:25.445]  You just got to arrest, I mean, you arrest a hundred people.
[01:32:25.445 --> 01:32:26.945]  It's over.
[01:32:26.945 --> 01:32:28.066]  The president knows who they are.
[01:32:28.066 --> 01:32:28.906]  I'll give them a damn list.
[01:32:28.906 --> 01:32:29.407]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:32:29.847 --> 01:32:40.634]  Well, and the other thing that I think we're looking at, too, for 2020, OK, if they if Trump does win and they give him the victory instead of faking that Joe Biden won, what are you going to have?
[01:32:40.634 --> 01:32:45.578]  You're going to have so much looting and rioting and burning and destruction on the streets just like after we saw.
[01:32:46.178 --> 01:32:48.239]  When Trump won the first time in D.C.
[01:32:48.239 --> 01:32:50.981]  during the inauguration, they'll just do it election night.
[01:32:50.981 --> 01:32:53.542]  And they'll just do it the next night, and the next night, and the next night.
[01:32:53.542 --> 01:33:00.625]  And so then there'll be all this chaos, and then the media can swoop in and say, oh wait, we've done a recount, Biden actually won.
[01:33:00.625 --> 01:33:07.889]  And there'll be so much chaos and crap on the streets, they can actually roll the president out of the White House with the corrupted military heads that they have.
[01:33:07.889 --> 01:33:13.132]  That's why they're so desperate to keep Flynn on the sidelines, with this corrupt judge now refusing to drop the case.
[01:33:13.132 --> 01:33:14.873]  Exactly, look it, Trump just has the-
[01:33:15.293 --> 01:33:19.034]  A hundred globalists arrested, and they've got all the files on all of them.
[01:33:19.034 --> 01:33:22.494]  The whole thing will roll over, the stock market will double, and it's over.
[01:33:22.494 --> 01:33:24.275]  America already dominates the planet.
[01:33:24.275 --> 01:33:25.595]  It's us or the Chi-Coms.
[01:33:25.595 --> 01:33:26.435]  It's got to stop.
[01:33:26.435 --> 01:33:28.155]  Oh, you free this country?
[01:33:28.155 --> 01:33:31.176]  It's a joke, the amount of prosperity that this country could have.
[01:33:31.176 --> 01:33:32.896]  I mean, the next day.
[01:33:32.896 --> 01:33:37.077]  You free Americans from this mental enslavement?
[01:33:37.077 --> 01:33:39.738]  You free Americans from this victimhood mentality?
[01:33:39.738 --> 01:33:41.338]  I mean, we're under a damn cult, Savannah.
[01:33:42.301 --> 01:33:50.167]  I completely agree Alex and you know going out and being outside and facing these people has really woken me up personally to this and that's why I'm very passionate about it as well.
[01:33:50.167 --> 01:33:51.128]  We're going to play some of that next segment.
[01:33:51.128 --> 01:34:05.700]  Because you know we have completely seen the dismantling of the nuclear family, the indoctrination of our youth, of college students, the abolishment of the police and the defunding of this, the dismantling of the system that Ilhan Omar just called for.
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.101]  Someone in our very own Congress
[01:34:07.401 --> 01:34:12.266]  So we've seen this time and time again that just so many people are trying to destroy America from within.
[01:34:12.266 --> 01:34:17.391]  And, I mean, it's been a crazy thing to see, Alex, and these are wild times to be living in.
[01:34:17.391 --> 01:34:19.914]  And by the way, you're a good example of how Infowars runs.
[01:34:19.914 --> 01:34:22.336]  We might have the former top lawyer that wrote the U.S.
[01:34:22.336 --> 01:34:23.577]  and global bioweapons law.
[01:34:23.577 --> 01:34:25.679]  We might have a former, you know, multi-star general.
[01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:27.201]  We might have a member of Congress on.
[01:34:27.201 --> 01:34:27.881]  But we hired you.
[01:34:28.522 --> 01:34:35.927]  To, I guess, you know, do video editing, write up some of the logs of the show, do some basic stuff like that, work on production.
[01:34:35.927 --> 01:34:37.989]  But I said, hey, you ought to get on air.
[01:34:37.989 --> 01:34:39.990]  And then now you've gone out in the field.
[01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:41.771]  You've not been radicalized by Alex Jones.
[01:34:41.771 --> 01:34:43.372]  You've not been told what to think or do.
[01:34:43.372 --> 01:34:45.394]  You've actually been here and seen it for yourself.
[01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:46.694]  Exactly.
[01:34:46.694 --> 01:35:04.061]  And again, it comes down to just me wanting to go express my First Amendment right in any, I mean, I challenge anybody, any American to go and do this just so they can experience for themselves just how far we've come as a country where you can't even go express your own First Amendment right on the streets of America without being violently attacked.
[01:35:04.061 --> 01:35:07.962]  We have groups, we have BLM, we have Antifa that think they run these streets.
[01:35:07.962 --> 01:35:10.383]  We have communist organizations, anarchists that
[01:35:10.703 --> 01:35:11.584]  All my wife's friends aren't
[01:35:38.306 --> 01:35:38.966]  Super liberals.
[01:35:56.412 --> 01:36:00.693]  No, no, let me tell you, they've really screwed themselves.
[01:36:00.693 --> 01:36:06.295]  Let me kind of clarify, because I'm going to respond to what Savannah said with my, if you want to say pessimism or whatever.
[01:36:06.295 --> 01:36:10.697]  It's not pessimism, it's that there's this whole... This is too damn dangerous to let this go any further.
[01:36:10.697 --> 01:36:17.499]  And there's this whole notion that people have that someone else is going to fight the fight for them, or someone else is going to take care of the problem, and someone else...
[01:36:17.719 --> 01:36:19.481]  No, you have to do it, man.
[01:36:19.481 --> 01:36:20.542]  You have to do it.
[01:36:20.542 --> 01:36:21.903]  And again, that's not anti-Trump.
[01:36:21.903 --> 01:36:23.184]  Trump is our Michael Jordan.
[01:36:23.184 --> 01:36:26.847]  If Jordan misses 32 shots, he's still taking the last shot.
[01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:27.888]  He's still the best player.
[01:36:27.888 --> 01:36:28.709]  That's Trump.
[01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:30.851]  So he's going to have the ball in his hand at the end of the game.
[01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:37.958]  But if you're not there to set the screen, if you're not there to pass him the ball, if you're not there on the floor, then he's a man on his own.
[01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:39.199]  They're going to try to steal his throw.
[01:36:39.199 --> 01:36:39.359]  Exactly.
[01:36:39.359 --> 01:36:42.482]  Quit thinking that Trump, Michael Jordan can win the basketball game.
[01:36:42.482 --> 01:36:43.223]  He can't do it alone.
[01:36:43.943 --> 01:36:45.184]  People have to get active.
[01:36:45.184 --> 01:36:47.165]  They need to realize you're in the fight for this country.
[01:36:47.165 --> 01:36:47.965]  You listening to this.
[01:36:47.965 --> 01:36:49.806]  We'll be right back.
[01:36:49.806 --> 01:36:53.328]  I am cutting this breaking announcement on July 9th.
[01:36:53.328 --> 01:36:57.430]  By Monday, we will have to end the biggest sale yet of the year.
[01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:59.952]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[01:36:59.952 --> 01:37:09.737]  It's a July 4th sale, the tail end of it, and all of the high quality products that were sold out have been back in stock and are available again, but some of these are in limited numbers.
[01:37:09.737 --> 01:37:12.078]  Ladies and gentlemen, not just storewide free shipping, double Patriot points,

[01:37:32.844 --> 01:37:33.544]  All of these.

[01:37:35.985 --> 01:37:37.385]  We have it in stock, get your orders in now.
[01:37:37.965 --> 01:37:40.447]  Again, Survival Shield X3, 50% off.

[01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:46.250]  Double Patriot Points to run free shipping.
[01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.871]  It's about to end.
[01:37:46.871 --> 01:37:48.832]  Take action now and thank you all for your support.
[01:37:48.832 --> 01:37:59.159]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[01:37:59.159 --> 01:38:03.862]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[01:38:04.542 --> 01:38:12.905]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[01:38:12.905 --> 01:38:32.793]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsite, summit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[01:38:33.453 --> 01:38:34.474]  Destinies.
[01:38:34.474 --> 01:38:41.399]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[01:38:41.399 --> 01:38:45.902]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[01:38:45.902 --> 01:38:49.905]  So take action, or be slaves!
[01:38:49.905 --> 01:38:54.949]  Listeners are saying what I was privately saying to the crew last night.
[01:38:54.949 --> 01:39:00.073]  We may have just broken not just the biggest story in InfoWars history, but one of the biggest stories, period.
[01:39:00.945 --> 01:39:20.669]  The state of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH have created a system where anyone that has a sore throat or a runny nose or who has been in contact with someone with COVID-19 is then added into the database as having a case and is counted as a case of COVID-19.
[01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:22.529]  It's in the NIH documents.
[01:39:22.529 --> 01:39:23.369]  It's at the state level.
[01:39:23.369 --> 01:39:24.429]  We confirmed it in Texas.
[01:39:24.429 --> 01:39:26.210]  We're now confirming it's in other states.
[01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:26.970]  This is beyond
[01:39:28.210 --> 01:39:35.278]  The other smoking guns, of them putting people that die of gunshot wounds and stuff in the COVID column, and the false positive test, that's all huge.
[01:39:35.278 --> 01:39:37.360]  This is beyond that.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.223]  Mega criminal activity.
[01:39:40.223 --> 01:39:46.009]  And we've got these different county commission videos where they're just freaking out over it, saying, what in the world is this?
[01:39:46.009 --> 01:39:47.931]  The full video is posted at BandOnVideo.
[01:39:47.931 --> 01:39:48.852]  Get it out and expose the hoax.
[01:39:50.675 --> 01:39:58.805]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:40:00.151 --> 01:40:04.894]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[01:40:04.894 --> 01:40:07.255]  Super Male Vitality!
[01:40:07.255 --> 01:40:16.101]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[01:40:16.101 --> 01:40:26.948]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[01:40:27.268 --> 01:40:27.928]  Yes.
[01:40:27.928 --> 01:40:32.851]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[01:40:32.851 --> 01:40:39.775]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[01:40:39.775 --> 01:40:40.815]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:40:40.815 --> 01:40:42.676]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[01:40:42.676 --> 01:40:45.497]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:40:45.497 --> 01:40:52.761]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:40:52.761 --> 01:40:55.423]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:12.774 --> 01:41:17.865]  This is a few weeks ago when Savannah got attacked.
[01:41:17.865 --> 01:41:22.374]  She peacefully held up a sign saying Police Lives Matter in the name of a black police officer who was killed.
[01:41:22.374 --> 01:41:23.977]  We'll play the latest attack coming up.
[01:41:27.278 --> 01:41:29.600]  It's extremely distressing to me.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:30.120]  Woah!
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:30.521]  Woah!
[01:41:30.521 --> 01:41:31.021]  Hey!
[01:41:31.021 --> 01:41:31.181]  Hey!
[01:41:31.181 --> 01:41:31.341]  Hey!
[01:41:31.341 --> 01:41:31.662]  Hey!
[01:41:31.662 --> 01:41:31.902]  Hey!
[01:41:31.902 --> 01:41:32.022]  Hey!
[01:41:32.022 --> 01:41:32.502]  Stop!
[01:41:32.502 --> 01:41:33.003]  Stop!
[01:41:33.003 --> 01:41:33.423]  Stop!
[01:41:33.423 --> 01:41:33.823]  Stop!
[01:41:33.823 --> 01:41:34.564]  Stop!
[01:41:34.564 --> 01:41:34.884]  Stop!
[01:41:34.884 --> 01:41:35.225]  Stop!
[01:41:35.225 --> 01:41:35.665]  Stop!
[01:41:35.665 --> 01:41:37.787]  I need you to stop.
[01:41:37.787 --> 01:41:38.828]  Look at me.
[01:41:38.828 --> 01:41:39.368]  Look at me.
[01:41:39.368 --> 01:41:40.289]  Look at me.
[01:41:40.289 --> 01:41:42.391]  You can't have... I don't understand.
[01:41:42.391 --> 01:41:42.571]  Look.
[01:41:42.571 --> 01:41:43.612]  You can't have the...
[01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:59.836]  That's what happens when you call an inspector and it's your First Amendment right as a conservative.
[01:41:59.836 --> 01:42:05.617]  That happened a few weeks ago and for people on radio that can't see it, you've got millions of views on Twitter and everywhere.
[01:42:05.617 --> 01:42:10.598]  She hits you, you elbow her, she runs over and starts crying to one of the six-foot-five trainees.
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:16.805]  Yeah you know they want to hit you and they want to be violent but when you push back they don't know how to handle it.
[01:42:16.805 --> 01:42:30.860]  She looked extremely shocked and my favorite part is right here where she just like bows her head down because she's so upset and she cried for five minutes after that after that shoulder check because and again that was me defending myself after being attacked by this woman for over an hour.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:31.540]  Well they're LARPing.
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:33.202]  They think they're playing Fortnite.
[01:42:33.202 --> 01:42:34.003]  This isn't Fortnite.
[01:42:34.563 --> 01:42:35.163]  Exactly.
[01:42:35.163 --> 01:42:37.884]  And again, too, like these people, that's the thing, Alex.
[01:42:37.884 --> 01:42:40.584]  They want a war, so they say.
[01:42:40.584 --> 01:42:42.165]  They want to take over.
[01:42:42.165 --> 01:42:45.325]  They want to have total control.
[01:42:45.325 --> 01:42:51.186]  But when push comes to shove and they attack you and you fight back, they don't know how to handle it.
[01:42:51.186 --> 01:42:55.287]  And the first people they call are the same ones they're calling to defund right now.
[01:42:55.287 --> 01:42:56.808]  And here's how the illusion works.
[01:42:56.808 --> 01:42:58.508]  I'm going to get Owen's take on this before we play your next video.
[01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:09.713]  All these big corporations capitulate to the most ridiculous stuff like, oh, we'll stop having chess games and saying white knight takes black rook or whatever.
[01:43:09.713 --> 01:43:12.876]  They're saying all of this to create a gaslighting event.
[01:43:12.876 --> 01:43:14.136]  They admit it.
[01:43:14.136 --> 01:43:20.341]  So all the big corporations say, oh, we're going to play at the start of the NFL, the black national anthem and all this to divide the country.
[01:43:21.101 --> 01:43:22.241]  People say this is crazy.
[01:43:22.241 --> 01:43:23.262]  Yeah, it's on purpose.
[01:43:23.262 --> 01:43:24.442]  It's the big money.
[01:43:24.442 --> 01:43:25.802]  It's the foreign countries.
[01:43:25.802 --> 01:43:27.703]  This is an attack on the nation.
[01:43:27.703 --> 01:43:40.166]  And it's so obvious, but people see the peer pressure and they think, if I just bow again, again, again, like the Chick-fil-A owner has now disgraced himself and says, now you need to get down and polish black people's shoes.
[01:43:40.166 --> 01:43:44.087]  As if the idea that you're white, you're bad, that's racism.
[01:43:44.087 --> 01:43:47.108]  Imagine if somebody said blacks should get down and polish somebody's shoes.
[01:43:47.108 --> 01:43:48.128]  It's insane.
[01:43:48.128 --> 01:43:48.288]  Owen?
[01:43:49.226 --> 01:43:52.729]  Well, I haven't had a Chick-fil-A sandwich since, I probably won't.
[01:43:52.729 --> 01:43:57.272]  Same thing goes for this other local restaurant that makes me wear a mask when I'm standing outside.
[01:43:57.272 --> 01:43:59.574]  Okay, I'm never, like you said, like I'm never shopping here again.
[01:43:59.574 --> 01:44:02.116]  If you want to kill your business that way, then so be it.
[01:44:02.116 --> 01:44:03.978]  That's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
[01:44:03.978 --> 01:44:08.922]  But you know, when it comes to these protesters out on the streets, you know, it's weird because
[01:44:10.049 --> 01:44:16.114]  You can say there's enemies of freedom, but that's not, to me, the correct psychological approach.
[01:44:16.114 --> 01:44:19.076]  Because I don't sit here and see them as my enemy.
[01:44:19.076 --> 01:44:20.838]  I don't see them as an enemy of freedom.
[01:44:20.838 --> 01:44:24.280]  I think if you ask them, they want to be free too, just like anybody else.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.604]  But what they've become, unwittingly, is obstacles of freedom.
[01:44:28.604 --> 01:44:30.865]  They have become obstacles of freedom.
[01:44:30.865 --> 01:44:32.126]  And as soon as Americans
[01:44:33.087 --> 01:44:33.687]  I think?
[01:44:52.719 --> 01:45:00.746]  You know, 10,000 people can be surrounding your vehicle, threatening to kill you, smashing the windows and everything, and if you plow through it, you're the bad guy.
[01:45:00.746 --> 01:45:04.089]  That's right, they got the corporations, they got the judges, they got the media.
[01:45:04.089 --> 01:45:10.775]  Now, all over the place, Black Lives Matter can beat people up, kill them, but if somebody fights back now, they're being charged everywhere!
[01:45:10.775 --> 01:45:18.621]  And the judges are proud of it because they're all a bunch of scum that were put in power because the system picked them because they were followers.
[01:45:18.621 --> 01:45:20.303]  This is rule by followers.
[01:45:20.583 --> 01:45:23.227]  There are three instances right now.
[01:45:23.227 --> 01:45:27.292]  Someone painted over a Black Lives Matter in the street facing hate crime charges.
[01:45:27.292 --> 01:45:32.119]  Somebody painted white lives matter in the street facing hate crime charges.
[01:45:32.119 --> 01:45:37.326]  Somebody, this is the craziest thing, somebody drove over, they put a pride flag on the road.
[01:45:37.526 --> 01:45:39.087]  Somebody literally just drove over it!
[01:45:39.087 --> 01:45:40.928]  They're investigating it for a hate crime!
[01:45:40.928 --> 01:45:42.548]  And they said that they'd burn out on it.
[01:45:42.548 --> 01:45:45.369]  You can look, it's not even a burnout, it's tiny black mark.
[01:45:45.369 --> 01:45:52.292]  Imagine, you write something on the street, and then... But I noticed on Twitter it shows the cops celebrating it, standing on it.
[01:45:52.292 --> 01:46:00.036]  And so now they're saying, oh, you disrespected it that way, even though they were out there worshipping the LGBT system.
[01:46:00.036 --> 01:46:01.757]  I mean, Alex, let's be honest, that's no burnout.
[01:46:03.423 --> 01:46:04.604]  You know what a burnout looks like.
[01:46:04.604 --> 01:46:05.885]  That's not a burnout.
[01:46:05.885 --> 01:46:12.649]  I hope somebody burns out on it because it's an in-your-face thing that they continue to push everywhere.
[01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:17.892]  So, but that's the point is, oh, you drove over and left a mark on a pride flag.
[01:46:17.892 --> 01:46:19.093]  We're investigating you for hate crime.
[01:46:19.093 --> 01:46:20.154]  Let's go back to that Twitter account.
[01:46:20.914 --> 01:46:31.843]  Look at this, they say, investigators would like to speak with the driver responsible for defacing a recently installed Pride crosswalk at 16th Street, and it goes on.
[01:46:31.843 --> 01:46:36.447]  Now if you scroll down, people go, hey, wait a minute, you're standing on the symbol of royalty and power.
[01:46:36.447 --> 01:46:41.691]  This is nothing but the globalist party, the Democratic Party, saying, we own you, we run you.
[01:46:41.691 --> 01:46:47.336]  They're painting Black Lives Matter on the street officially in front of Trump Tower as if Trump's done something wrong.
[01:46:47.336 --> 01:46:50.058]  Again, this is just all about their virtue signaling, Savannah.
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:57.965]  Alex, and I don't know if you saw this story as well, but somebody had hacked into one of the, like, digital traffic signs on the side and they put All Lives Matter.
[01:46:57.965 --> 01:46:59.466]  They're investigating that as well.
[01:46:59.466 --> 01:47:12.253]  And it's ridiculous, because again, I'm so tired that Black Lives Matter, which again, is a Marxist organization, is allowed to paint their slogan across our cities, all across America, and also, it's okay for you to burn me.
[01:47:12.253 --> 01:47:12.974]  It's their gang mark.
[01:47:12.974 --> 01:47:14.855]  It's like a dog hiding its leg and pissing on you.
[01:47:14.955 --> 01:47:15.295]  That's right.
[01:47:39.710 --> 01:47:41.671]  Bowing makes it go away.
[01:47:41.671 --> 01:47:42.411]  Exactly.
[01:47:42.411 --> 01:47:44.892]  So that's why we've reached this point.
[01:47:44.892 --> 01:47:45.412]  These people got charged.
[01:47:45.412 --> 01:47:50.814]  So we've raised the narrative that nobody, you know, stands up for America anymore.
[01:47:50.814 --> 01:47:56.356]  And again, too, Alex, that's why I wanted to go out as well and stand up because I knew I was going to get attacked.
[01:47:56.356 --> 01:48:08.160]  And that's the point I wanted to make, too, is that why in America in 2020 can a minority woman, female, not stand peacefully with the sign without being attacked by a mob of crazy Antifa leftists?
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.602]  By the way, it was mainly white dudes that was hurt.
[01:48:10.602 --> 01:48:12.803]  It's always white people!
[01:48:12.803 --> 01:48:15.985]  It's always white people, Alex, or Hispanic people.
[01:48:15.985 --> 01:48:20.168]  Like, honestly, too, with these Black Lives Matter protests, it's like white people and Hispanic people.
[01:48:20.168 --> 01:48:24.991]  Like, it's usually the black people that will come and talk with me, but they're not attacking me.
[01:48:24.991 --> 01:48:26.172]  And it's ridiculous.
[01:48:26.172 --> 01:48:30.675]  We've gone so far as a country, and I'm so done with people acting like we're... Yeah, look at this white dude.
[01:48:30.675 --> 01:48:33.937]  He's like a foot and a half taller than you, and he's bumping you with his elbow.
[01:48:33.937 --> 01:48:34.277]  Yep.
[01:48:34.277 --> 01:48:36.279]  He's lucky Owen didn't knock him upside the head.
[01:48:36.279 --> 01:48:37.219]  I want to be clear.
[01:48:37.219 --> 01:48:38.020]  I was told not to.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:38.981]  No, I understand.
[01:48:38.981 --> 01:48:39.441]  I understand.
[01:48:39.441 --> 01:48:40.482]  No, you were scared of him.
[01:48:40.482 --> 01:48:41.483]  I'm joking.
[01:48:41.483 --> 01:48:44.025]  And so let's go ahead and roll the audio of this for radio listeners.
[01:48:44.025 --> 01:48:51.812]  But this is you in front of the police station trying to say Black Lives Matter and with the name of the police officer captain that was brutally murdered who was black.
[01:48:51.812 --> 01:48:52.172]  Here it is.
[01:48:52.172 --> 01:48:52.793]  Let's roll the audio.
[01:49:00.083 --> 01:49:01.464]  And you try to get away from them, too, you're not.
[01:49:01.464 --> 01:49:06.009]  And remember, Alex, I planned this rally because I went to the other one and they attacked me because they said I was up there.
[01:49:06.009 --> 01:49:08.732]  So I planned this for myself outside of them.
[01:49:08.732 --> 01:49:09.793]  And then they show up.
[01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:11.534]  Yes, and then look what happens.
[01:49:11.534 --> 01:49:12.315]  I get surrounded.
[01:49:12.315 --> 01:49:19.742]  I should have said that right up front, that you planned a rally.
[01:49:19.742 --> 01:49:21.224]  Police lives matter if you folks show up.
[01:49:35.688 --> 01:49:41.909]  Alex, these people do not own these streets anymore and that's why I wanted to come stand up because in my first video, I did not fight back.
[01:49:41.909 --> 01:49:45.070]  I sat there and I kept letting that girl attack me, but this time, no.
[01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:48.851]  And that's why I wanted to stand on this street corner and say that I have a right to stand here.
[01:49:48.851 --> 01:49:49.891]  I have a right to be here.
[01:49:50.191 --> 01:49:52.053]  These people do not own APD.
[01:49:52.053 --> 01:49:53.714]  They do not own these city streets.
[01:49:53.714 --> 01:49:55.035]  They don't own City Hall.
[01:49:55.035 --> 01:49:56.516]  They don't own America.
[01:49:56.516 --> 01:49:58.538]  They don't own this country.
[01:49:58.538 --> 01:49:59.379]  We do.
[01:49:59.379 --> 01:50:00.299]  Americans do.
[01:50:00.299 --> 01:50:03.382]  So stand up, get off your ass, and get off of Twitter.
[01:50:03.382 --> 01:50:06.925]  You know what is interesting about that event, though, Alex?
[01:50:06.925 --> 01:50:10.848]  And I think Savannah and the other people that were there, some of the crew members, would agree.
[01:50:10.848 --> 01:50:11.949]  Savannah was kind of hinting at this.
[01:50:12.429 --> 01:50:20.256]  The black people that showed up that were just genuinely there because they're against police brutality or oppression or whatever, and you know, are kind of open-minded.
[01:50:20.256 --> 01:50:22.398]  I had some legitimate conversations with some of them.
[01:50:22.398 --> 01:50:24.881]  In fact, one of them has agreed to come on The War Room next week.
[01:50:24.881 --> 01:50:25.221]  Good.
[01:50:25.221 --> 01:50:32.648]  But it's these white Antifa people who are clearly trained... Oh, they're trained communists, and here's how you can identify them.
[01:50:32.648 --> 01:50:33.949]  They all wear helmets!
[01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:36.452]  They all wear these damn helmets!
[01:50:36.452 --> 01:50:41.358]  And in fact, I went back and I reviewed... They wear black helmets and black masks because they don't want people to know they're white!
[01:50:41.358 --> 01:50:44.381]  And I think that, I really think that these are, these are college professors.
[01:50:44.381 --> 01:50:45.042]  Oh, they are?
[01:50:45.042 --> 01:50:46.264]  These are college professors.
[01:50:46.264 --> 01:50:50.609]  These are, these are UT student teachers assistants and college professors.
[01:50:50.609 --> 01:50:51.350]  That's why they're so good.
[01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.630]  Well, they are.
[01:50:51.630 --> 01:50:52.851]  We find out every time they get arrested they are.
[01:50:52.851 --> 01:50:53.953]  And so that's, and then...
[01:50:55.154 --> 01:51:01.076]  So it's like they ruin the actual Black Lives Matter, whether or not you agree with it or not.
[01:51:01.076 --> 01:51:03.016]  Because it's all for us.
[01:51:03.016 --> 01:51:04.096]  They're in control.
[01:51:04.096 --> 01:51:05.077]  Yeah.
[01:51:05.077 --> 01:51:07.557]  It's these crazy, you know, it is these crazy ass white people.
[01:51:07.557 --> 01:51:08.578]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[01:51:08.578 --> 01:51:09.378]  We're going to go to break.
[01:51:09.378 --> 01:51:10.818]  Well, they're leftists that have been brainwashed.
[01:51:10.818 --> 01:51:12.099]  They're told they're about to rule.
[01:51:12.099 --> 01:51:13.619]  This is their political takeover.
[01:51:13.619 --> 01:51:14.499]  And they know damn well what they're doing.
[01:51:14.499 --> 01:51:15.059]  We're going to break.
[01:51:15.059 --> 01:51:16.300]  50 more minutes with these guys.
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:18.360]  And Dan Lyman's back in studio with big breaking news.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.361]  A lot of other big stuff breaking here today.
[01:51:21.201 --> 01:51:32.286]  Please don't forget, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, right now, the 4th of July special has to end by Sunday, and a lot of these items won't be back in for a while because the supply chain's breaking down.
[01:51:32.286 --> 01:51:37.248]  So get your X2, get your X3, your Vitamin Mineral Fusion, get your Winter Sun now!
[01:51:39.082 --> 01:51:46.205]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning, and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[01:51:46.205 --> 01:51:55.168]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese, walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[01:51:55.168 --> 01:51:59.910]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up, and the woman stops and points at me.
[01:51:59.910 --> 01:52:03.191]  So they stop, and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[01:52:03.191 --> 01:52:05.451]  Truck started, and they sit there and stretch.
[01:52:05.451 --> 01:52:06.232]  She keeps pointing.
[01:52:06.913 --> 01:52:08.910]  And they put their hands out like they're waiting for me.
[01:52:10.236 --> 01:52:14.677]  To go, because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[01:52:14.677 --> 01:52:18.639]  And so then I just sat there, so they acted angry and walked past me.
[01:52:18.639 --> 01:52:23.980]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:24.941]  This is mental illness.
[01:52:24.941 --> 01:52:28.522]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[01:52:28.522 --> 01:52:29.942]  This is all cult programming.
[01:52:29.942 --> 01:52:31.523]  This is all about submitting.
[01:52:31.523 --> 01:52:34.364]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[01:52:34.364 --> 01:52:35.764]  It's all a giant fraud.
[01:52:35.764 --> 01:52:38.045]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[01:52:40.057 --> 01:52:46.301]  I must end this special, our extended July 4th special, by Monday the 12th.
[01:52:46.301 --> 01:52:48.943]  That is our drop dead date.
[01:52:48.943 --> 01:52:57.089]  It absolutely has to happen because a lot of these products that have been sold out, we can only get limited supplies of them because the supply chain is breaking down.
[01:52:57.714 --> 01:52:58.335]  We're good to go.
[01:53:17.012 --> 01:53:17.792]  Free shipping.
[01:53:17.792 --> 01:53:23.495]  It's the same thing with Vitamin Refusion, Survival Shield X3, and so much more.
[01:53:23.495 --> 01:53:25.275]  And it funds the information war.
[01:53:25.275 --> 01:53:27.996]  The globalists want you sick and weak and dumbed down.
[01:53:27.996 --> 01:53:30.777]  They don't want you to know what God has given us all through Mother Nature.
[01:53:30.777 --> 01:53:32.158]  These products are powerful.
[01:53:32.158 --> 01:53:34.239]  Many of you have tried them and reordered them and loved them.
[01:53:34.239 --> 01:53:35.079]  Many of you haven't.

[01:53:49.955 --> 01:53:51.756]  It's all meant to be insane.
[01:53:51.756 --> 01:53:57.278]  Everything The Globalist does is about to make us shut down and just give in to them.
[01:53:57.278 --> 01:53:58.699]  Look at some of these headlines.
[01:53:58.699 --> 01:53:59.439]  Supreme Court.
[01:53:59.439 --> 01:54:07.363]  Nearly half of Oklahoma is given to an Indian reservation for a pedophile.
[01:54:07.363 --> 01:54:09.304]  Yes, you can't make that up.
[01:54:09.304 --> 01:54:13.006]  Gasoline Maxwell made to wear paper clothes due to suicide risk.
[01:54:13.006 --> 01:54:13.666]  Privacy alert.
[01:54:13.666 --> 01:54:16.848]  Your iPhone is quietly tracking everything you do everywhere you go.
[01:54:16.848 --> 01:54:17.028]  That's
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:20.001]  Fox News telling us that.
[01:54:20.001 --> 01:54:26.907]  Oh, and then there's a Wall Street Journal article owned by the same people telling us that everything we do psychologically is being watched by the phone.
[01:54:26.907 --> 01:54:28.408]  It's all coming out.
[01:54:28.408 --> 01:54:29.348]  Everything we talked about...
[01:54:30.256 --> 01:54:32.357]  Before, they didn't want people to resist then.
[01:54:32.357 --> 01:54:35.098]  They didn't want opinions formed against it before it was rolled out.
[01:54:35.098 --> 01:54:43.321]  But now they're rolling it out, and now they're telling us pedophilia is good, world government's good, dying is good, having no rights is good.
[01:54:43.321 --> 01:54:45.102]  And everything has COVID right behind it.
[01:54:45.102 --> 01:54:48.123]  So, oh, you can't have a protest because of COVID.
[01:54:48.123 --> 01:54:49.884]  Oh, you can't organize a group of people.
[01:54:49.884 --> 01:54:51.565]  You can't go to church because of COVID.
[01:54:51.565 --> 01:54:55.086]  Now, you're going to be arrested or fined if you dare violate.
[01:54:55.086 --> 01:54:57.207]  So, you know, just, just accept it.
[01:54:57.207 --> 01:54:57.807]  Just accept it.
[01:54:57.867 --> 01:55:00.588]  By the way, we have this video, right?
[01:55:00.588 --> 01:55:01.908]  I meant to play it at the start of the show.
[01:55:01.908 --> 01:55:08.010]  De Blasio says BLM protesters can continue while canceling all other large events.
[01:55:08.010 --> 01:55:10.750]  And he used the same thing they all use, apples and oranges.
[01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:14.532]  So your church isn't essential, but the BLM can continue.
[01:55:14.532 --> 01:55:16.532]  So everything else is shut down but Democrats.
[01:55:16.532 --> 01:55:17.992]  They're saying, we rule the streets.
[01:55:17.992 --> 01:55:20.033]  Don't leave your house, but we rule the streets.
[01:55:20.033 --> 01:55:21.893]  And when we march, it fights COVID.
[01:55:21.893 --> 01:55:23.154]  Literally 2 plus 2 equals 500.
[01:55:23.914 --> 01:55:30.778]  Part of me almost wants them, in a kind of diabolical war way, to just shut everything down nationwide.
[01:55:30.778 --> 01:55:34.821]  Just so conservatives can free up time to fight back.
[01:55:34.821 --> 01:55:39.443]  Just so we could have a 10,000 rally strong in 50 cities, just like they have for George Floyd.
[01:55:39.443 --> 01:55:41.345]  Who, by the way, I mean, we barely even covered this.
[01:55:41.345 --> 01:55:42.425]  I mentioned it yesterday.
[01:55:42.425 --> 01:55:44.106]  The transcripts came out from George Floyd.
[01:55:46.508 --> 01:55:54.555]  He was foaming at the mouth, smashing his head against the cop vehicle on the inside, ranting and raving in the backseat.
[01:55:54.555 --> 01:55:57.137]  Like you said, then started coming down from his drug trip.
[01:55:57.137 --> 01:55:58.598]  Excited delirium.
[01:55:58.598 --> 01:56:01.440]  Asked them to take him out of the vehicle and put them on the ground.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.123]  Again, I'm not glad George Floyd died.
[01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:04.503]  You know what?
[01:56:04.503 --> 01:56:06.164]  Maybe that cop does deserve some punishment.
[01:56:06.164 --> 01:56:07.205]  You can review it and decide.
[01:56:07.205 --> 01:56:08.166]  I don't live in Minneapolis.
[01:56:08.186 --> 01:56:13.390]  But it's another Democrat city, they knew each other, and all of this is the excuse for what they've done.
[01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:17.933]  It has nothing to do with black people, it's about bringing the country down, sinking the ship.
[01:56:17.933 --> 01:56:20.795]  And they haven't stopped rioting since.
[01:56:20.795 --> 01:56:21.555]  They haven't stopped.
[01:56:21.555 --> 01:56:31.342]  And they're, oh, they get carte blanche, but oh, if you want to go out and even drive your car over a gay pride thing that's been painted on the road, well, we're going to investigate you for a hate crime.
[01:56:31.342 --> 01:56:34.344]  We're going to go watch the cameras, and we're going to contact you, and you're going to get in trouble.
[01:56:35.014 --> 01:56:36.094]  So this is the new world?
[01:56:36.094 --> 01:56:37.375]  This is the- This is a cult!
[01:56:37.375 --> 01:56:43.918]  Imagine if Scientologists painted their flag on the ground, and you drove over it, they'd come after you, they'd arrest them all!
[01:56:43.918 --> 01:56:44.618]  So what do we do?
[01:56:44.618 --> 01:56:45.238]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:56:45.238 --> 01:56:52.101]  It's like, so I kind of want them to shut everything down, and then finally maybe Trump supporters and conservatives, 10,000 strong per city, will get out in the streets.
[01:56:52.101 --> 01:57:00.145]  It's like, if we all went out to Austin, and 10,000 of us painted over the Austin Black Matters, or whatever it is, what are they going to do?
[01:57:00.145 --> 01:57:01.085]  Arrest all of us?
[01:57:01.085 --> 01:57:04.327]  But you know, if one or two people did it- Guarantee you they'd say it was a hate crime.
[01:57:05.017 --> 01:57:07.882]  If one or two people did it, but if 10,000 people did it, what are they going to do?
[01:57:09.508 --> 01:57:11.869]  All I know is, is that this is pure crap.
[01:57:11.869 --> 01:57:19.072]  Because they claim Black Lives Matter when the group doing it literally is founded to kill black people and their mission statement is no nuclear family.
[01:57:19.072 --> 01:57:19.993]  That'll kill everybody!
[01:57:19.993 --> 01:57:25.955]  And you know Alex, I actually brought up that point to one of the BLM protesters the other night and he had no idea.
[01:57:25.955 --> 01:57:27.476]  I was like, he was like, well who said that?
[01:57:27.476 --> 01:57:33.699]  And I said the founders of Black Lives Matter, they, they're literally talking about dismantling the nuclear family.
[01:57:33.699 --> 01:57:34.919]  They're pro-abortion.
[01:57:34.919 --> 01:57:37.120]  And their main mission is black trans men.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:39.041]  That's black men getting their balls cut off.
[01:57:39.141 --> 01:57:42.022]  People who stand up for Black Lives Matter have no idea.
[01:57:42.022 --> 01:57:43.102]  They have no idea.
[01:57:43.102 --> 01:57:44.542]  I represent black people.
[01:57:44.542 --> 01:57:46.422]  I'm here to chop your balls off.
[01:57:46.422 --> 01:57:50.883]  And that's why when I was talking to them and I said, hey, here's what we should do.
[01:57:50.883 --> 01:57:58.924]  End the war on drugs, release all non-violent criminals tomorrow, and probably lower the drinking age, raise speed limits.
[01:57:58.924 --> 01:58:02.245]  You need to cut interactions between citizens and police down.
[01:58:02.245 --> 01:58:04.225]  And they were kind of like, huh, that's a good solution.
[01:58:04.225 --> 01:58:07.246]  And have police target more white collar crime in the establishment.
[01:58:07.626 --> 01:58:09.948]  But no one ever suggests that.
[01:58:09.948 --> 01:58:10.848]  No!
[01:58:10.848 --> 01:58:13.510]  Let's sterilize black boys!
[01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:15.051]  Because we really like blacks.
[01:58:15.051 --> 01:58:15.852]  Well, you know what?
[01:58:15.852 --> 01:58:25.578]  What that guy said over there was actually really accurate, and I agree, but he's white, and... I love black people so much, I want to abort them, and if they made it out of mama, cut their balls off!
[01:58:25.578 --> 01:58:29.521]  The Southern Poverty Law Center told me not to listen to that guy.
[01:58:29.521 --> 01:58:30.882]  Chop their balls!
[01:58:30.882 --> 01:58:32.123]  Chop their balls!
[01:58:32.123 --> 01:58:33.363]  Chop their balls!
[01:58:33.363 --> 01:58:33.744]  BLM!
[01:58:33.744 --> 01:58:34.024]  BLM!
[01:58:34.024 --> 01:58:34.664]  BLM!
[01:58:34.664 --> 01:58:35.024]  BLM!
[01:58:35.024 --> 01:58:35.185]  BLM!

[01:58:58.553 --> 01:58:59.654]  Ultra 12, I call it B12.

[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:07.801]  We're good to go.
[01:59:49.423 --> 01:59:54.186]  I mean, Black Lives Matter is run by Planned Parenthood, Original Funding, George Soros.
[01:59:54.186 --> 01:59:55.848]  Their main mission is to get rid of black people.
[01:59:55.848 --> 01:59:57.769]  I mean, go read it.
[01:59:57.769 --> 01:59:58.449]  It's ridiculous.
[01:59:58.449 --> 02:00:01.051]  And then, like, we want to make black men trans.
[02:00:01.051 --> 02:00:03.213]  That's our main mission, to get rid of the nuclear family.
[02:00:03.213 --> 02:00:09.017]  I mean, if I wanted to get rid of people, I'd say, chop your balls off and don't have a nuclear family.
[02:00:09.017 --> 02:00:10.638]  I mean, that means sterilize you, kill you.
[02:00:11.977 --> 02:00:15.142]  So it's the other arm of that, and the left's like, yeah.
[02:00:15.142 --> 02:00:17.947]  You know, we're like, black, winking at me, and I'm like, I don't want to kill black people.
[02:00:17.947 --> 02:00:19.269]  Oh, come on, come on.
[02:00:19.269 --> 02:00:22.153]  But I mean, I gotta tell you, black folks, they're your total enemy.
[02:00:22.153 --> 02:00:23.595]  I mean, you just need to wake up, Savannah.
[02:00:24.508 --> 02:00:34.333]  I completely agree, Alex, and we've seen that in the exact, I mean, everything that's been going on for the past couple of months and how they've weaponized the black community, used their own emotions against them.
[02:00:34.333 --> 02:00:36.294]  Now we're seeing all this rioting in the street.
[02:00:36.294 --> 02:00:41.416]  We're seeing more death in the black community as a response to all of this.
[02:00:41.416 --> 02:00:43.257]  And it's very sad to see.
[02:00:43.257 --> 02:00:53.182]  So I wish people would really wake up to what's actually going on and how they're being used as pawns in society today to further push political agendas and further push these just bad ideas.
[02:00:53.302 --> 02:00:55.386]  Because it's mainly white people eating it till now.
[02:00:55.386 --> 02:01:00.156]  Now we have footage coming out of New York of the church with black dudes going and threatening to beat everybody up.
[02:01:00.156 --> 02:01:02.941]  I mean, folks, you don't want to be lured into doing that.
[02:01:03.519 --> 02:01:13.164]  Exactly, and you know, I think at the beginning of all this I just saw somebody say that Black Lives Matter is great at marketing because their organization looks like, you know, it's just about Black Lives Matter.
[02:01:13.164 --> 02:01:22.568]  But then again, if you really look into the organization as a whole, you research what they actually stand for, it's opposite of what the real black community actually stands for.
[02:01:22.568 --> 02:01:27.650]  Because I've gone and I've talked to so many people that have been a part of this community and they're like, what about the nuclear family?
[02:01:27.650 --> 02:01:32.613]  Like, we all know that children that are raised in a one-parent household have higher rates of going on drugs.
[02:01:33.353 --> 02:01:39.276]  You want black guys to go to a multiracial church and threaten to kick people's asses and yell at people's little kids?
[02:01:39.276 --> 02:01:41.597]  I mean, I'm surprised these guys did not get their asses beat bad.
[02:01:41.597 --> 02:01:42.057]  You know what?
[02:01:42.057 --> 02:01:45.159]  The answer to that is, Alex, it's very simple, and this happens all the time.
[02:01:45.159 --> 02:01:48.861]  It's the same reason why the Latino girls always attack Savannah.
[02:01:48.861 --> 02:01:53.543]  It's the same reason why some gay crossdresser threatened to kill and rape Ashley St.
[02:01:53.543 --> 02:01:54.644]  Clair.
[02:01:54.644 --> 02:01:55.344]  It's the same reason.
[02:01:55.344 --> 02:01:56.705]  These people are jealous.
[02:01:57.145 --> 02:02:05.771]  They're jealous that that black family walked in there with a strong father figure, a strong mother figure, a son that dresses well and knows how to play a musical instrument and has a future.
[02:02:05.771 --> 02:02:06.251]  They're jealous.
[02:02:06.251 --> 02:02:06.571]  Well, that's it.
[02:02:06.571 --> 02:02:09.913]  If you look at them, whether they're black or white, they all look like rat-like mental patients.
[02:02:09.913 --> 02:02:13.836]  Like, if I was going to cast for a movie about mental patients, that would be them.
[02:02:14.176 --> 02:02:24.961]  Alex, and not to be mean, but the people on the streets, they are the people who are obese, who don't take showers, who just, their overall quality of life does not look good, and you can see it reflected in the way they take care of themselves.
[02:02:24.961 --> 02:02:26.502]  And they're the type of people that just keep buying lottery tickets.
[02:02:26.502 --> 02:02:30.243]  They think, finally, the media's on my side, if I go do this, I'll be a hero.
[02:02:30.243 --> 02:02:31.324]  No, you're an idiot!
[02:02:31.684 --> 02:02:32.045]  Exactly.
[02:02:32.045 --> 02:02:33.086]  They think they're making a change.
[02:02:33.086 --> 02:02:36.912]  They think they're leading this revolution, when in reality, they're doing nothing.
[02:02:36.912 --> 02:02:43.161]  They can't even stand up for themselves, which is why they have to come mob one person in a group of ten, because they can't stand individually.
[02:02:43.161 --> 02:02:44.563]  They don't even know what they stand for.
[02:02:44.563 --> 02:02:45.304]  That's right.
[02:02:45.304 --> 02:02:45.904]  Alright, now here we go.
[02:02:47.381 --> 02:02:48.282]  This is DeBlasio.
[02:02:48.282 --> 02:02:49.543]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:02:49.543 --> 02:02:53.846]  It says BLM protests can continue while canceling all other large events.
[02:02:53.846 --> 02:02:58.530]  So literally, party members of the Democratic Party, they run it, they get the money.
[02:02:58.530 --> 02:03:06.237]  Our party is allowed to be on the streets, but Christian groups, conservative groups, libertarian groups, no one else, Jewish groups,
[02:03:07.097 --> 02:03:08.858]  I will arrest you!
[02:03:08.858 --> 02:03:10.820]  Because BLM is important, you're not.
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:12.341]  He's saying you are not essential.
[02:03:12.341 --> 02:03:15.063]  And he says, oh, we got a few religious leaders that agree with me.
[02:03:15.063 --> 02:03:17.765]  So if one religious leader agrees, all of you have no rights.
[02:03:17.765 --> 02:03:19.386]  Here it is.
[02:03:19.386 --> 02:03:22.909]  Outdoor concerts, and it means things like parades.
[02:03:22.909 --> 02:03:29.133]  You know, things here in this city can mean not just thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:03:29.133 --> 02:03:30.895]  It's just not time for that now.
[02:03:30.895 --> 02:03:31.835]  What about protests?
[02:03:31.835 --> 02:03:34.958]  If people want to march down Fifth Avenue, are they going to be allowed to do so?
[02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:38.450]  Look, Wolf, this is always an area of real sensitivity.
[02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:43.191]  If you're just talking about health, we would always say, hey folks, you know, stay home if you can.
[02:03:43.191 --> 02:03:48.332]  But we understand at this moment in history, people are talking about the need for historic changes.
[02:03:48.332 --> 02:03:56.974]  I mean, today, in New York City, you know, recognizing the power and the meaning of the message Black Lives Matter, which we did in front of Trump Tower today.
[02:03:57.734 --> 02:03:59.375]  This is a historic moment of change.
[02:03:59.375 --> 02:04:09.779]  We have to respect that, but also say to people, the kinds of gatherings we're used to, the parades, the fairs, we just can't have that while we're focusing on health right now.
[02:04:09.779 --> 02:04:13.180]  And by the way, so they'll decide in the future, too, who can rally, who can demonstrate.
[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:19.143]  So, if you want to have a Catholic parade, or you want to have a Protestant parade, or you want to have a parade for the military, that's not allowed.
[02:04:19.143 --> 02:04:20.223]  Because that doesn't matter.
[02:04:20.223 --> 02:04:21.384]  That speech doesn't matter.
[02:04:21.384 --> 02:04:27.026]  This speech of the Democrats and Soros and Marxism and no nuclear family, it's so important.
[02:04:27.026 --> 02:04:27.466]  It does survive.
[02:04:28.306 --> 02:04:33.549]  Exactly, and you know they always try to say too, well we can't impede on their First Amendment right to protest.
[02:04:33.549 --> 02:04:36.491]  Well what about our right to religion, our freedom to religion?
[02:04:36.491 --> 02:04:38.612]  How is that any different?
[02:04:38.612 --> 02:04:41.614]  So it's ridiculous that they're picking and choosing what can and cannot be done.
[02:04:41.614 --> 02:04:43.955]  It has a name, it's called total discrimination.
[02:04:43.955 --> 02:04:45.196]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:04:45.970 --> 02:04:57.125]  I just can't imagine the type of blackmail that de Blasio has on him with his top staffer that had all the child porn, terabytes of child pornography, child rape, snuff films.
[02:04:57.125 --> 02:04:58.207]  We know about Wiener's lab.
[02:04:58.207 --> 02:05:00.069]  By the way, I've talked about that staffer on here before.
[02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:01.071]  He said that guy looks like a pedophile.
[02:05:01.691 --> 02:05:03.792]  You know, all the stuff that was on Wiener's laptop.
[02:05:03.792 --> 02:05:04.892]  He was running out of New York.
[02:05:04.892 --> 02:05:06.612]  So, does Wiener look like a pedophile?
[02:05:06.612 --> 02:05:12.074]  All the stuff that was in the safe at the Epstein Manor in New York.
[02:05:12.074 --> 02:05:14.094]  Of course, you've got the Nixivim sex cult.
[02:05:14.094 --> 02:05:16.115]  You've got Cuomo, the mass murderer.
[02:05:16.115 --> 02:05:18.315]  I mean, they're doing all this in public.
[02:05:18.315 --> 02:05:19.816]  They're doing all this right in front of your face.
[02:05:19.816 --> 02:05:23.757]  You've got Cuomo with his, you know, both his nipples pierced on TV and his brother hit and run.
[02:05:23.757 --> 02:05:24.937]  These are sick criminals.
[02:05:25.137 --> 02:05:27.539]  And just think about the real dirt.
[02:05:27.539 --> 02:05:35.304]  Think about the real crimes these people are engaging in behind closed doors, that they're so bold that they're going to come out here and be so clearly human.
[02:05:35.304 --> 02:05:37.446]  I mean, just look at Weiner.
[02:05:37.446 --> 02:05:40.448]  That's the guy they have on the laptop with Hillary chopping up kids and stuff.
[02:05:42.415 --> 02:05:46.417]  And so, you know, part of the... Weiner agrees, though.
[02:05:46.417 --> 02:05:49.458]  He says, you know, you criticize him, you deserve to be arrested.
[02:05:49.458 --> 02:05:50.139]  He's God.
[02:05:50.139 --> 02:05:50.799]  And you know what?
[02:05:50.799 --> 02:05:58.722]  I think, too, that maybe this is the ultimate... By the way, you know he's the special protege of Chuckie Schumer.
[02:05:58.722 --> 02:06:01.604]  No, Weiner was actually found by him, put in, and run by him.
[02:06:01.604 --> 02:06:06.466]  Schumer was blackmailed years ago because he married a transsexual, but that's a separate story.
[02:06:07.498 --> 02:06:15.325]  I really think that the New York cops and the New York FBI that are good people but are actually going through the process of this, it's time to just release it.
[02:06:15.325 --> 02:06:17.247]  It's time to release the- That's right.
[02:06:17.247 --> 02:06:18.768]  No more wait around.
[02:06:18.768 --> 02:06:19.809]  The gloves are off.
[02:06:19.809 --> 02:06:21.090]  They broke all the rules.
[02:06:21.090 --> 02:06:21.831]  Just burn them!
[02:06:21.831 --> 02:06:22.231]  Burn!
[02:06:22.231 --> 02:06:22.612]  Burn!
[02:06:22.612 --> 02:06:22.932]  Burn!
[02:06:22.932 --> 02:06:23.993]  We've made a step.
[02:06:23.993 --> 02:06:25.174]  We're totally attacking.
[02:06:25.174 --> 02:06:25.615]  Burn!
[02:06:25.615 --> 02:06:26.115]  Attack!
[02:06:26.115 --> 02:06:26.555]  Catch it!
[02:06:26.555 --> 02:06:27.036]  Yeah!
[02:06:27.256 --> 02:06:30.939]  Whether America can handle it or not, there's only one way to find out.
[02:06:30.939 --> 02:06:32.681]  Yeah, let's just get it going here.
[02:06:32.681 --> 02:06:33.202]  It's time.
[02:06:33.202 --> 02:06:36.124]  It's time for people to know what... I mean, Trump knows about it.
[02:06:36.124 --> 02:06:40.728]  Trump jokes about how Hillary Clinton kidnaps all these children from Haiti and puts them into sex camps.
[02:06:40.728 --> 02:06:41.789]  They all know it!
[02:06:41.789 --> 02:06:42.971]  The AP came out.
[02:06:42.971 --> 02:06:45.613]  The woman that got caught doing it runs Amber Alert.
[02:06:45.613 --> 02:06:47.475]  Laura Silsby.
[02:06:47.475 --> 02:06:47.875]  Literally.
[02:06:47.875 --> 02:06:48.636]  She changed her name.
[02:06:48.636 --> 02:06:50.317]  Look at this.
[02:06:50.317 --> 02:06:52.900]  Fox employees ask company to stop building police vehicles.
[02:06:54.434 --> 02:06:56.236]  See, to build stuff, you gotta get the permission.
[02:06:56.236 --> 02:07:01.520]  New Yorkers signed a petition to topple slave owner Washington statue, but not Muhammad, who said slavery was good.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:01.920]  Video.
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:07.866]  Vice President of Zimbabwe says country stars because white people didn't teach them economics.
[02:07:07.866 --> 02:07:08.366]  Continuing.
[02:07:08.366 --> 02:07:10.888]  Don Lemon bashes Jesus, says he was not good.
[02:07:10.888 --> 02:07:13.210]  Not perfect.
[02:07:13.210 --> 02:07:13.691]  Chicago.
[02:07:13.691 --> 02:07:16.173]  Black Lives Matter mural painted over with All Lives Matter.
[02:07:17.861 --> 02:07:21.063]  Bill de Blasio, Al Sharpton, paint Black Lives Matter on the street in front of Trump Tower.
[02:07:21.063 --> 02:07:23.985]  So he leads demonstrations, but you can't have yours.
[02:07:23.985 --> 02:07:26.927]  He literally says, mine is valuable, yours is not.
[02:07:26.927 --> 02:07:28.489]  And they have a name for that, tyrant.
[02:07:28.489 --> 02:07:29.569]  They're not social distancing either.
[02:07:29.569 --> 02:07:30.390]  He looks like a pedophile.
[02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:31.271]  No social distancing.
[02:07:31.271 --> 02:07:34.052]  But you know what, here's the- Are they a Democrat?
[02:07:34.052 --> 02:07:36.975]  Give her like, might be a redneck if you do this.
[02:07:36.975 --> 02:07:38.496]  Might be a pedophile if you're a Democrat.
[02:07:39.136 --> 02:07:39.757]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:07:39.757 --> 02:07:42.940]  I just hope that people in New York realize how bad it is.
[02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:44.162]  And I know they do.
[02:07:44.162 --> 02:07:45.443]  I don't live in New York.
[02:07:45.443 --> 02:07:47.245]  I used to like going to visit New York.
[02:07:47.245 --> 02:07:49.187]  I don't know if New York City, if I will anymore.
[02:07:49.187 --> 02:07:51.911]  No, it was bad until Giuliani got in.
[02:07:51.911 --> 02:07:52.671]  He did clean it up.
[02:07:54.093 --> 02:07:57.595]  I mean, New York is falling apart at the seams.
[02:07:57.595 --> 02:07:58.815]  Trash everywhere.
[02:07:58.815 --> 02:08:00.896]  Giant, rotting carcass.
[02:08:00.896 --> 02:08:02.057]  Just murders.
[02:08:02.057 --> 02:08:07.079]  I mean, literally people, I'm not even kidding, people just walk around downtown and they walk by dead bodies bleeding out in the street from gunshots.
[02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:09.280]  Mental patients are just running around.
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.040]  And, but what is de Blasio doing?
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:13.402]  Oh, he's painting a Black Lives Matter mural.
[02:08:13.402 --> 02:08:14.802]  Oh, that's going to save a life.
[02:08:14.802 --> 02:08:16.203]  That's going to save New York.
[02:08:16.203 --> 02:08:16.383]  Yeah.
[02:08:17.609 --> 02:08:21.734]  It's just the, oh yeah, saying Black Lives Matter cares about black people.
[02:08:21.734 --> 02:08:22.615]  Look at Sharpton.
[02:08:22.615 --> 02:08:26.259]  That's like saying that Mother Teresa was a whore or something.
[02:08:26.259 --> 02:08:26.940]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:27.681]  By the way, let's say this.
[02:08:28.752 --> 02:08:30.093]  Everybody's just freaked out right now.
[02:08:30.093 --> 02:08:32.254]  This is actually, a lot of this is a blessing.
[02:08:32.254 --> 02:08:38.957]  When it floods in New York, or Boston, or old cities like that, or Chicago, you don't see a lot of rats until it floods.
[02:08:38.957 --> 02:08:40.298]  And there's a big storm coming.
[02:08:40.298 --> 02:08:43.559]  And when it floods, there's like rats everywhere.
[02:08:43.559 --> 02:08:46.321]  And that's what's happened is the Liberty Movement waking up the world.
[02:08:46.321 --> 02:08:52.424]  Populism is like a flood, and you're just seeing the rats that were already right there behind the walls coming out.
[02:08:53.044 --> 02:08:54.424]  Savannah Hernandez, closing comments.
[02:08:54.424 --> 02:08:56.305]  You guys have got the war room coming up today, don't you?
[02:08:56.305 --> 02:08:56.905]  3pm central.
[02:08:56.905 --> 02:08:57.825]  Yeah, I got a special thing.
[02:08:57.825 --> 02:09:02.287]  Harrison will be hosting in studio, but I'll be, let's just say I'll be on site somewhere.
[02:09:02.287 --> 02:09:04.787]  And we never got to your city council, uh, situation.
[02:09:04.787 --> 02:09:05.488]  Ah, yes.
[02:09:05.488 --> 02:09:07.988]  And if you guys want to roll it, it's a two minute video.
[02:09:07.988 --> 02:09:10.989]  But basically, uh, and we provided all the documentation.
[02:09:10.989 --> 02:09:12.410]  The mask mandate is false.
[02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:13.470]  The shutdown is false.
[02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:14.670]  The cases are false.
[02:09:14.670 --> 02:09:15.991]  And I told the whole city council this.
[02:09:15.991 --> 02:09:16.511]  They don't care.
[02:09:16.511 --> 02:09:17.451]  They just want to oppress us.
[02:09:17.811 --> 02:09:20.374]  Okay, we're going to play that when we come back.
[02:09:20.374 --> 02:09:24.238]  They'll be gone, but we'll have Dan Lyman with huge breaking news in the studio with us.
[02:09:24.238 --> 02:09:25.920]  And is Dan coming back on your show?
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:26.961]  Yeah, I believe he'll be on.
[02:09:26.961 --> 02:09:28.242]  Like I said, I'm not in studio today.
[02:09:28.242 --> 02:09:28.723]  Harrison is.
[02:09:28.723 --> 02:09:29.704]  I'm going to be on site.
[02:09:29.704 --> 02:09:30.765]  I got a little surprise today.
[02:09:30.765 --> 02:09:31.346]  I think you'll like it.
[02:09:31.346 --> 02:09:32.207]  Alright, stay with us.
[02:09:32.207 --> 02:09:32.827]  Thanks, Savannah.
[02:09:32.827 --> 02:09:33.368]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:33.368 --> 02:09:33.929]  Thank you.
[02:09:36.707 --> 02:09:39.309]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[02:09:39.309 --> 02:09:52.117]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[02:09:52.897 --> 02:09:53.557]  I think so.
[02:10:12.643 --> 02:10:16.647]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[02:10:16.647 --> 02:10:21.891]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[02:10:21.891 --> 02:10:29.758]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[02:10:29.758 --> 02:10:33.602]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[02:10:33.602 --> 02:10:35.644]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[02:10:45.563 --> 02:10:48.656]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[02:10:48.656 --> 02:10:51.266]  Where did it come from?
[02:10:56.198 --> 02:11:00.521]  We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.

[02:11:32.761 --> 02:11:39.304]  Other systems, just don't compare.
[02:11:39.304 --> 02:11:41.926]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:54.662]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:11:54.662 --> 02:11:57.184]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:11:57.184 --> 02:12:01.586]  What about Owen Schroeder?
[02:12:01.586 --> 02:12:07.169]  When I call your name, don't forget to unmute.
[02:12:07.169 --> 02:12:07.689]  Owen Schroeder?
[02:12:07.689 --> 02:12:09.870]  Go ahead, you have two minutes.
[02:12:11.488 --> 02:12:13.989]  I hope y'all are having fun playing tyrants up here.
[02:12:13.989 --> 02:12:20.310]  The disregard that this city council has for its citizens is obvious and concerning.
[02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:26.131]  And this one of the authoritarian Mr. Astat and his totalitarian rhetoric is quite frankly offensive.
[02:12:26.131 --> 02:12:29.792]  But this mask mandate, which is not legal.
[02:12:29.792 --> 02:12:31.992]  First we're told by the Surgeon General not to wear masks.
[02:12:31.992 --> 02:12:33.472]  We're told by Fauci not to wear masks.
[02:12:33.472 --> 02:12:35.493]  We're told by the CDC not to wear masks.
[02:12:35.493 --> 02:12:36.993]  They even have this on their website.
[02:12:36.993 --> 02:12:38.053]  What happened to that?
[02:12:38.053 --> 02:12:40.174]  The mask does not even stop COVID.
[02:12:40.174 --> 02:12:40.874]  That's science.
[02:12:41.770 --> 02:12:43.692]  So why are you telling us to wear it?
[02:12:43.692 --> 02:12:48.256]  The boxes that the masks come in say it does not stop COVID.
[02:12:48.256 --> 02:12:49.537]  Why are you telling us to wear it?
[02:12:49.537 --> 02:12:52.700]  In fact, the mask has negative health effects.
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:55.603]  Bacteria grows on the mask.
[02:12:55.603 --> 02:13:00.568]  You breathe in toxic levels of carbon dioxide when you wear the mask.
[02:13:00.568 --> 02:13:04.372]  For the sake of time, I'll spare you the details, but you can find this.
[02:13:04.372 --> 02:13:04.872]  It's out there.
[02:13:04.872 --> 02:13:05.553]  It's very well known.
[02:13:06.133 --> 02:13:10.375]  Now, first, when we had to shut down months ago and stay home, what were we told?
[02:13:10.375 --> 02:13:12.636]  Oh, this is a deadly virus, we need to stay home.
[02:13:12.636 --> 02:13:18.839]  Well, we now know that it's less deadly by the numbers than the seasonal flu.
[02:13:18.839 --> 02:13:23.201]  And how is Ascot earlier saying that we just ignore the math?
[02:13:23.761 --> 02:13:25.962]  Well, the math doesn't matter.
[02:13:25.962 --> 02:13:27.403]  What is this, 1984?
[02:13:27.403 --> 02:13:28.583]  No, the math does matter.
[02:13:28.583 --> 02:13:30.044]  This is not that deadly.
[02:13:30.044 --> 02:13:31.284]  The numbers are wrong.
[02:13:31.284 --> 02:13:33.285]  This is as bad as the seasonal flu.
[02:13:33.285 --> 02:13:37.507]  So, everything we're talking about should be null and void right now.
[02:13:37.507 --> 02:13:42.269]  Should we be shutting down and treating life this way for the seasonal flu every year?
[02:13:42.269 --> 02:13:44.950]  Should we have been living wrong the whole time?
[02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:45.831]  Is this the new normal?
[02:13:46.585 --> 02:13:49.807]  And this whole thing about cases going up, well, why are cases up?
[02:13:49.807 --> 02:13:51.808]  Because everyone's getting tested!
[02:13:51.808 --> 02:13:53.329]  This is common sense!
[02:13:53.329 --> 02:13:58.973]  You could test everyone in the city for herpes, and herpes cases would be going up as well!
[02:13:58.973 --> 02:14:02.995]  Would you have a national shutdown and tell people to stop kissing and going out?
[02:14:02.995 --> 02:14:06.697]  And by the way, the tests are not even 100% accurate.
[02:14:06.697 --> 02:14:08.238]  That is also known.
[02:14:08.238 --> 02:14:11.580]  So who knows what the real cases really are?
[02:14:13.533 --> 02:14:15.535]  Thank you very much, Mr. Schroeder.
[02:14:15.535 --> 02:14:18.098]  Why do the politicians all over the world love this big tech?
[02:14:18.098 --> 02:14:24.065]  Because you see the City Council, but now Owen's not there at the meeting.
[02:14:24.065 --> 02:14:25.387]  Again, it's further dehumanization.
[02:14:25.387 --> 02:14:28.170]  But here's the CDC's own website.
[02:14:28.170 --> 02:14:31.294]  COVID-19 is no longer a epidemic.
[02:14:33.285 --> 02:14:36.027]  Because the death numbers statistically are not high enough for that.
[02:14:36.027 --> 02:14:40.910]  But everybody's testing positive, because they've ramped up the testing massively.
[02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:44.173]  And that's why they're calling it the numbers are up, not the death.
[02:14:44.173 --> 02:14:48.616]  But as soon as the winter or the fall starts, you will get some real pneumonia, some real flu deaths.
[02:14:48.616 --> 02:14:51.978]  And they can put those in a column, and they'll use that to totally shut things down again.
[02:14:51.978 --> 02:14:54.059]  This is truly a psychological takeover.
[02:14:54.059 --> 02:14:57.082]  Dan Lyman is joining us here, visiting from Switzerland.
[02:14:57.082 --> 02:15:00.264]  Reporter for InfoWars via EuropeWars.com.
[02:15:00.264 --> 02:15:01.465]  Had a great interview yesterday.
[02:15:02.659 --> 02:15:12.334]  I want to just spend time in this shorter segment of the time we have left, just in general, about your view of the world and the election and just all the crazy communists running around and where all this is going.
[02:15:13.274 --> 02:15:22.116]  Yeah, it's amazing to watch it unfolding across the United States, but then also it's catching fire, so to speak, in Europe as well.
[02:15:22.116 --> 02:15:23.636]  And then also, of course, in Australia.
[02:15:23.636 --> 02:15:27.757]  It's just amazing the way that Western civilization, the direction it's headed in at this point.
[02:15:27.757 --> 02:15:32.978]  So I think things will, of course, they will only increase in intensity as we get closer to the election.
[02:15:32.978 --> 02:15:37.639]  And frankly, if Trump wins, I think they will continue to increase past that.
[02:15:37.639 --> 02:15:39.720]  And I shudder to think what would happen if
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:46.704]  Biden wins based on the program and the platform that he's putting out more and more increasingly and the people that are behind him.
[02:15:46.704 --> 02:15:49.626]  And how are patriots going to react to that at that point?
[02:15:49.626 --> 02:15:52.547]  And I can say, Dan, is there a war on Western civilization?
[02:15:52.547 --> 02:15:58.351]  Every UN, every globalist organization says they want to get rid of the Western civilization, the nuclear family.
[02:15:58.351 --> 02:15:59.751]  That's just a human thing.
[02:15:59.751 --> 02:16:01.072]  And just everything that's good.
[02:16:01.072 --> 02:16:05.575]  It's such an alien, evil agenda.
[02:16:05.575 --> 02:16:07.476]  From studying history's roots, where does it come from?
[02:16:09.107 --> 02:16:13.929]  As Owen and I were saying yesterday, at its root, of course, this is a spiritual battle.
[02:16:13.929 --> 02:16:19.211]  And I think a lot of people are starting to figure that out now because we're starting to see just how evil a lot of these people are.
[02:16:19.211 --> 02:16:22.692]  You watch these videos of Savannah and Owen getting... We're not cherry-picking!
[02:16:22.692 --> 02:16:24.152]  I mean, they're almost all evil.
[02:16:24.152 --> 02:16:24.652]  Absolutely.
[02:16:24.652 --> 02:16:26.033]  And you can find them over and over.
[02:16:26.033 --> 02:16:31.955]  And you were touching on earlier the video of the people going into the church that are now being attacked by Black Lives Matter activists.
[02:16:31.955 --> 02:16:37.557]  So this is a spiritual battle that has manifested itself in the political and cultural war that we're seeing unfolding right now.
[02:16:38.257 --> 02:16:41.279]  Because when God goes out of the world, what comes in?
[02:16:41.279 --> 02:16:42.100]  Satanic behavior.
[02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:43.921]  I mean, look at these people.
[02:16:43.921 --> 02:16:45.482]  Look how they're walking.
[02:16:45.482 --> 02:16:51.486]  The Black Lives Matter people, whether they be black or white, they literally walk like goblins or something.
[02:16:51.486 --> 02:16:54.868]  Yeah, as you always say, the light has gone out in their eyes, and you can see it.
[02:16:54.868 --> 02:16:57.710]  And you know, Owen and I were talking about this earlier yesterday as well.
[02:16:59.457 --> 02:17:09.662]  The increasingly people are being you're being identified that you're basically a dissident or a thought criminal by your behavior or your actions that you're not taking.
[02:17:09.662 --> 02:17:16.426]  So as time has gone on, you know, you've gone from being able to wear the MAGA hat to not because you're going to be attacked or an InfoWars t-shirt.
[02:17:16.426 --> 02:17:17.446]  You might be worried about that.
[02:17:17.446 --> 02:17:22.909]  So you you stopped identifying yourself as a dissident or a patriot or now you can't.
[02:17:23.129 --> 02:17:29.010]  Just say, hey, all police aren't bad or now they're saying Ford can't sell vehicles to the police.
[02:17:29.010 --> 02:17:30.830]  What is the dominance over everything?
[02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:31.490]  Absolutely.
[02:17:31.490 --> 02:17:37.431]  And now and you hear these stories now increasingly like the other day when they did the on Instagram, everyone put up the black squares.
[02:17:37.431 --> 02:17:45.973]  You had a lot of stories coming out of people who were being pressured by their fellow students or colleagues that if they didn't put up the square, then then they were getting harassed.
[02:17:45.973 --> 02:17:47.453]  So you can't even opt out of this.
[02:17:47.453 --> 02:17:51.054]  Oh, they're talking about kicking him out of high school, kicking him out of their job.
[02:17:51.054 --> 02:17:51.874]  Police officers.
[02:17:52.954 --> 02:17:54.936]  Mothers are getting fired in Atlanta?
[02:17:54.936 --> 02:18:08.628]  I mean, I know a retired SWAT team officer, a nice guy from California, I'm trying to get him on the show about this, he does some security for us, and he was a trainer at CrossFit here in Austin, and they said, oh, you were a police officer, you're fired.
[02:18:08.628 --> 02:18:10.790]  So just being, I mean, this is insanity.
[02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:13.373]  But the very same groups will call the police.
[02:18:13.373 --> 02:18:16.916]  It's like a crazy virtue signal, like, look, I did something.
[02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:24.424]  Right, and then as soon as something bad happens to them, they're calling the police, or as soon as there's a skid mark on a rainbow crossing, the police are getting involved.
[02:18:24.424 --> 02:18:28.830]  So, they really like the police when the police are doing their bidding, but they don't- Well, exactly.
[02:18:28.830 --> 02:18:33.636]  They want control of the police, so they're just crushing the police right now to make them roll over to their demands.
[02:18:34.016 --> 02:18:34.676]  Right, absolutely.
[02:18:34.676 --> 02:18:36.117]  This is terrorism.
[02:18:36.117 --> 02:18:36.938]  Absolutely it is.
[02:18:36.938 --> 02:18:41.280]  It's terrorism on our society, on our civilization, and it's endless.
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:43.141]  It's like every day there's something new.
[02:18:43.141 --> 02:18:53.346]  You know, everyone thought it was crazy when Minneapolis said they were going to defund or, you know, basically dismantle their police department, and now it's being rolled out in basically every Democrat-controlled major city across America.
[02:18:53.346 --> 02:18:56.848]  And they're taking the police budget and putting it into SJW arming.
[02:18:56.848 --> 02:19:02.711]  So you're not getting rid of the police, you're getting a new special fourth branch of emergency EMS all over the country.
[02:19:03.379 --> 02:19:04.080]  Right, exactly.
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.086]  And they are arrogant, crazy SJWs with guns.
[02:19:08.086 --> 02:19:08.386]  Definitely.
[02:19:08.386 --> 02:19:09.268]  That's not going to go well.
[02:19:10.376 --> 02:19:15.379]  And as we touched on yesterday, they're already building these civilian forces in Spain, for instance.
[02:19:15.379 --> 02:19:20.162]  They have over 3,000 civilians there that are patrolling the beaches now, as we were saying yesterday.
[02:19:20.162 --> 02:19:22.643]  So we see they are building their own escape.
[02:19:22.643 --> 02:19:24.004]  Well, this is a UN global formula.
[02:19:24.004 --> 02:19:30.488]  I mean, I've watched the UN hearings with the Attorney General Loretta Lynch five years ago, where they said, we're going to have the domestic security force.
[02:19:30.488 --> 02:19:31.888]  It's going to deal with emergencies.
[02:19:31.888 --> 02:19:32.829]  It's going to deal with outbreaks.
[02:19:32.829 --> 02:19:34.570]  It's going to deal with influxes of migrants.
[02:19:34.570 --> 02:19:36.131]  Because the influxes are coming.
[02:19:36.131 --> 02:19:39.313]  There's going to be migrants everywhere because they're organizing them and bringing them here.
[02:19:39.935 --> 02:19:40.315]  Right.
[02:19:40.315 --> 02:19:46.982]  And they're going to be all protected by the attorneys at the ACLU and these SPLC attack dogs.
[02:19:46.982 --> 02:19:50.706]  Anyone who speaks out against this is going to be under attack, for sure.
[02:19:50.706 --> 02:19:55.051]  It's so evil, it's hard to even comprehend it.
[02:19:55.051 --> 02:19:55.772]  It really is.
[02:19:55.772 --> 02:19:56.713]  Every day is crazy.
[02:19:56.713 --> 02:19:57.573]  Crazier than the last.
[02:19:59.448 --> 02:20:06.535]  And of course, Don Lemon with his doublespeak, he said, no, it doesn't matter if there's mass shootings of black on blacks a hundred times, a thousand times, the cops, we don't care.
[02:20:06.535 --> 02:20:13.382]  And we know that he knows better because Tucker's been pulling those clips, everyone's been pulling them up from 2013, 2014, what Don Lemon was saying back then.
[02:20:13.382 --> 02:20:14.183]  We know he knows better.
[02:20:14.183 --> 02:20:18.827]  Here's the question with Don Lemon and this arrogant look in his eyes, evil, evil, and all these folks.
[02:20:19.708 --> 02:20:21.511]  I mean, you're already on your knees, you're on your belly.
[02:20:21.511 --> 02:20:23.354]  How far are you going to get down to the New World Order?
[02:20:23.354 --> 02:20:25.277]  The police department's bowing down.
[02:20:25.277 --> 02:20:28.142]  You really think when the globals take over you're still getting your pension fund?
[02:20:28.142 --> 02:20:31.226]  You're idiots, and you have destroyed yourself along with us.
[02:20:31.226 --> 02:20:33.129]  It's time to stop bowing and stop groveling.
[02:20:35.356 --> 02:20:37.097]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[02:20:37.097 --> 02:20:37.577]  You're on the air.
[02:20:37.577 --> 02:20:39.017]  Thanks for holding.
[02:20:39.017 --> 02:20:39.818]  I sure can, sir.
[02:20:39.818 --> 02:20:40.798]  Thank you.
[02:20:40.798 --> 02:20:43.999]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:20:51.142 --> 02:20:52.582]  I just want to plug in.
[02:20:52.582 --> 02:20:57.003]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[02:20:57.003 --> 02:21:00.264]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[02:21:00.264 --> 02:21:03.645]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[02:21:03.645 --> 02:21:12.207]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[02:21:12.407 --> 02:21:18.052]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[02:21:18.052 --> 02:21:20.353]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[02:21:20.353 --> 02:21:22.815]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[02:21:22.815 --> 02:21:25.477]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[02:21:25.477 --> 02:21:29.520]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:31.322]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[02:21:31.322 --> 02:21:32.042]  So that means a lot to me.
[02:21:32.042 --> 02:21:32.403]  Thank you.
[02:21:32.403 --> 02:21:33.824]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[02:21:34.264 --> 02:21:37.907]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller.
[02:21:37.907 --> 02:21:51.298]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it and my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[02:21:51.878 --> 02:21:53.959]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[02:21:53.959 --> 02:21:55.540]  They're getting great responses.
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:22:02.802]  They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does, taken under the tongue, where it's more absorbable.
[02:22:02.802 --> 02:22:08.725]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, help the body produce more energy.
[02:22:08.985 --> 02:22:09.545]  We're good to go.
[02:22:35.077 --> 02:22:54.018]  I am cutting this ad on Friday and by Monday afternoon we have to end this special because even though a lot of these items have been sold out and just came back in, we only ordered a limited amount of things like bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula, because quite frankly, the supply chain has broken down with COVID-19 and a lot of products
[02:22:54.358 --> 02:22:59.842]  We've been unable to even get back in stock because the companies we get them from are partially shut down.
[02:22:59.842 --> 02:23:01.083]  This is totally crazy.
[02:23:01.083 --> 02:23:11.530]  So you've got just a few days left to take advantage of the July 4th mega sale with storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, and up to 60% off on high quality products.
[02:23:11.530 --> 02:23:12.611]  DNA Force Plus, 50% off.
[02:23:13.411 --> 02:23:14.611]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:23:51.257 --> 02:23:53.738]  Welcome to the year 2020.
[02:23:53.738 --> 02:23:59.461]  American flags on the 4th of July are burned in every town and city.
[02:23:59.461 --> 02:24:02.403]  And it's allowed under the First Amendment.
[02:24:02.403 --> 02:24:08.786]  But if you try to raise your flag and walk down the street, you'll get hit in the head with a brick.
[02:24:08.786 --> 02:24:09.867]  You don't have your free speech.
[02:24:09.867 --> 02:24:17.911]  And the police are so cowed, so trained to bow, that if Antifa punches you in the face and you fight back, you'll go to jail.
[02:24:19.651 --> 02:24:22.314]  These idiots actually think they're going to get ahead in life by appeasing.
[02:24:22.314 --> 02:24:25.957]  Because for so long they've had us appeasing, appeasing, appeasing, appeasing.
[02:24:25.957 --> 02:24:27.399]  But now we're going over the edge of the cliff.
[02:24:27.399 --> 02:24:31.663]  This is the moment where one more step of appeasement leads to the destruction of the Republic.
[02:24:33.911 --> 02:24:49.605]  Alright, I've got something really strong and powerful I'm gonna hit with Dan Lyman here of EuropeWars.com because Europe's ahead of us a lot in all the fires and the death and the killing and the looting and when he's been here two years ago in studio from EuropeWars.com he said I think in a couple years it'll be in America this bad.
[02:24:49.605 --> 02:24:53.408]  Well now we've reached what Europe has.
[02:24:53.408 --> 02:24:57.692]  Brought to you by the same UN, the same George Soros, the very same operation on record.
[02:24:58.473 --> 02:24:59.833]  We'll talk about it in a moment.
[02:24:59.833 --> 02:25:01.394]  We're not brought to you by George Soros.
[02:25:01.394 --> 02:25:03.295]  We're brought to you by you.
[02:25:03.295 --> 02:25:04.795]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:25:04.795 --> 02:25:12.538]  This is your last chance this weekend to get free shipping and double Patriot points, probably until Christmas.
[02:25:12.538 --> 02:25:17.400]  So probably the next time we have free shipping and double Patriot points, that's a big deal.
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:23.322]  And then we also have Vitamin Refusion back in stock, Vazzo Beats, DNA Force, Winter Sun Plus, Ultra 12 bodies.
[02:25:24.528 --> 02:25:29.990]  And a lot of other great items that have been sold out back in stock at 50 to 60% off.
[02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:41.874]  And quite frankly, I've been so busy covering news and fighting the globalists, I've got to go over and look at our inventory and what we've got to even have a new sale because everybody's habituated to only buy stuff when we have a sale.
[02:25:41.874 --> 02:25:42.894]  And that's kept us on air.
[02:25:42.894 --> 02:25:43.515]  That's great.
[02:25:43.515 --> 02:25:49.477]  But what happens when a third of the items, and I was in a meeting last two mornings on this for hours.
[02:25:52.005 --> 02:25:55.288]  Because I don't want to spend my time on getting product and marketing and funding ourselves.
[02:25:55.288 --> 02:25:57.730]  I want to stand, you know, on the air promoting the truth and fight back.
[02:25:57.730 --> 02:25:58.691]  But, you know, it's okay.
[02:25:58.691 --> 02:26:05.716]  Revolutionaries always have to fund themselves when you're up against the mega banks and the media and foreign governments and the leftists and the universities.
[02:26:05.716 --> 02:26:06.677]  You know, we're the underdog.
[02:26:06.677 --> 02:26:07.698]  America's the underdog.
[02:26:07.698 --> 02:26:08.719]  Trump's the underdog.
[02:26:08.719 --> 02:26:10.020]  You know, oh, they're the resistance.
[02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:11.381]  No, we're the resistance.
[02:26:11.381 --> 02:26:13.263]  The whole world's getting up against us, but it's okay.
[02:26:13.263 --> 02:26:15.985]  We're going to win again, thanks to God, and take an action.
[02:26:15.985 --> 02:26:16.966]  And just so God bless you all.
[02:26:18.729 --> 02:26:22.691]  This morning I sat there with horror because Tim finally got me a list of it and I'm not putting him down.
[02:26:22.691 --> 02:26:24.392]  He's been busy.
[02:26:24.392 --> 02:26:34.058]  But nine items we used to be able to get, we just can't get because the proprietary patented items aren't being manufactured anymore because a lot of companies have shut down.
[02:26:34.058 --> 02:26:36.359]  Our business wasn't enough to keep them open.
[02:26:36.359 --> 02:26:38.140]  These are big national suppliers.
[02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:40.721]  We get good, made in America, high quality stuff.
[02:26:40.721 --> 02:26:42.242]  None of it comes from China.
[02:26:42.242 --> 02:26:43.303]  It's all source tested.
[02:26:44.625 --> 02:26:47.587]  And so if you can't get it anymore, we don't replace it with some crap.
[02:26:47.587 --> 02:26:49.889]  And under law, too, you gotta reformulate if you change anything.
[02:26:49.889 --> 02:26:52.570]  So that's why I'll say plus if we ever reformulate.
[02:26:52.570 --> 02:26:57.073]  We always reformulate to make it better, but if you reformulate to make it not as good, it still has to be changed.
[02:26:57.073 --> 02:27:00.476]  And so I'm sitting here with horror watching the supply chain break down.
[02:27:00.476 --> 02:27:09.922]  You go to the grocery store, and a lot of the items you used to like to get are out, or there's some new brand you never saw that's crappy, because the old brand's out of business, folks.
[02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:14.039]  And during this thing, it's like, oh, we're not out of business.
[02:27:14.039 --> 02:27:14.880]  We've been bought.
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:17.783]  And I go look, it's Berkshire Hathaway, it's Soros.
[02:27:17.783 --> 02:27:24.271]  So many companies we used to use have been bought by a consortium with Bill Gates, a consortium of the Royal Family of England.
[02:27:24.271 --> 02:27:26.854]  I mean, you go research.
[02:27:26.854 --> 02:27:29.897]  Or, oh, we don't want to make this supplement anymore, because I'm smart.
[02:27:29.897 --> 02:27:31.339]  I've got like eight big manufacturers.
[02:27:31.339 --> 02:27:32.160]  We're down to like five now.
[02:27:33.424 --> 02:27:38.229]  Because a couple times, like with Emmerich's Essentials, they said, oh, we got bought by a big company.
[02:27:38.229 --> 02:27:39.430]  They don't want to make your stuff anymore.
[02:27:39.430 --> 02:27:40.551]  They don't like you.
[02:27:40.551 --> 02:27:42.553]  So they say, go out and build your own company.
[02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:43.754]  Go out and make your own thing.
[02:27:43.754 --> 02:27:44.615]  That's where it is now.
[02:27:44.615 --> 02:27:45.355]  And I'm not a victim.
[02:27:45.355 --> 02:27:46.296]  I'm not complaining.
[02:27:46.296 --> 02:27:53.983]  I'm telling you, I'm involved at a corporate supply side level, right down to marketing and delivery, the whole chain.
[02:27:53.983 --> 02:27:55.184]  We have to run it all.
[02:27:55.184 --> 02:27:56.566]  That which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[02:27:57.990 --> 02:28:01.437]  And so I've gotten to see basically every level, okay?
[02:28:01.437 --> 02:28:06.427]  Washington, Hollywood, marketing, corporate stuff, you name it.
[02:28:07.426 --> 02:28:08.867]  I've just, it's like cat's eye.
[02:28:08.867 --> 02:28:10.467]  I've just been, you know, that movie.
[02:28:10.467 --> 02:28:11.748]  I've seen a lot of wild stuff.
[02:28:11.748 --> 02:28:13.929]  Just God's put me there, part of my training, I guess.
[02:28:13.929 --> 02:28:16.990]  And I'm telling you, we're already in a depression worldwide.
[02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:18.311]  They keep things locked down.
[02:28:18.311 --> 02:28:20.071]  It's going to shut down almost everything.
[02:28:20.071 --> 02:28:23.253]  And then the supply chain breaks down and then it's super bad.
[02:28:23.253 --> 02:28:25.914]  It took decades and decades to build us this level.
[02:28:25.914 --> 02:28:29.235]  So you better get your storable foods while you still can.
[02:28:29.235 --> 02:28:31.836]  You better get your supplements while you still can.
[02:28:31.836 --> 02:28:33.997]  Because I'm telling you, it's just going to get crazier from here on out.
[02:28:33.997 --> 02:28:34.978]  We're going to make it through this.
[02:28:35.578 --> 02:28:40.740]  But it's going to take some major preparation and focus, and it's going to take keeping them full wars on the air.
[02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:42.201]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:28:42.201 --> 02:28:43.942]  But I would take action now, and I would get some horrible food.
[02:28:43.942 --> 02:28:46.683]  It's got three or four weeks for delivery during this, quote, lull.
[02:28:46.683 --> 02:28:48.204]  It's going to get a lot worse, I believe.
[02:28:48.204 --> 02:28:49.404]  So take action now.
[02:28:49.404 --> 02:28:54.226]  And it helps us fund people like Dan Lyman doing a great job writing reports with his crew every day in Europe.
[02:28:54.226 --> 02:28:55.787]  All right, Dan, this is a shorter segment.
[02:28:55.787 --> 02:28:56.588]  I did a long plug.
[02:28:56.588 --> 02:28:57.628]  Sorry.
[02:28:57.628 --> 02:28:58.408]  We got you 15 minutes.
[02:28:58.408 --> 02:29:00.509]  The next hour, Dr. Nick Beckett takes over.
[02:29:00.509 --> 02:29:01.390]  Before I get into
[02:29:02.170 --> 02:29:07.152]  The censorship, UN takeover, and the latest developments that are so huge with Facebook, next segment.
[02:29:07.152 --> 02:29:09.173]  What are some of the other things on your radar?
[02:29:09.173 --> 02:29:10.573]  Well, a couple of things that are on my radar.
[02:29:10.573 --> 02:29:14.355]  First, I'm just going to touch on here what's, we'll go to Europe.
[02:29:14.355 --> 02:29:27.560]  And what I'm noticing, I think it goes along with the fact that these, actually all these new mask rules that are coming in place here in Austin and Michigan and Colorado where they're getting even more aggressive with that.
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:28.541]  What I'm seeing is that
[02:29:29.361 --> 02:29:33.206]  California, you know, the expression is, as California goes, so goes the nation.
[02:29:33.206 --> 02:29:42.198]  And I'm seeing that kind of, it seems like all other states and cities and municipalities are starting to kind of conform to the precedent that California has set.
[02:29:42.198 --> 02:29:47.184]  And I think we're also seeing that in Europe as well, where you have France and Spain really
[02:29:47.945 --> 02:30:01.312]  Well, Sweden did the lowest and they had the lowest levels, same thing with where you live.
[02:30:01.312 --> 02:30:02.152]  Right, exactly.
[02:30:02.152 --> 02:30:12.077]  And you've seen the amount of pressure that has been put on Sweden to conform to that and to, you know, they've been demonized as the place that we're always going to be the worst and the death rates will be the worst and obviously that's not what happened.
[02:30:12.077 --> 02:30:13.838]  But one of the things that I'm seeing that's interesting
[02:30:14.318 --> 02:30:14.458]  Yes.
[02:30:33.317 --> 02:30:37.120]  They just introduced that you're going to have to wear one now on all public transportation.
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:41.042]  You're also going to have to wear it on all flights, which is all brand new.
[02:30:41.042 --> 02:30:47.386]  So Switzerland kind of held out for a while and I get the sense that the pressure has been on for them to start imposing mask mandates.
[02:30:47.386 --> 02:30:56.893]  And now what we're seeing is in also in Denmark, where they actually were even more liberal about the whole thing, they even reduced the social distancing from two meters down to one.
[02:30:56.893 --> 02:30:59.574]  So it kind of makes you think, well, why, where did they come up with these numbers?
[02:31:00.495 --> 02:31:01.296]  It's all BS.
[02:31:01.296 --> 02:31:03.759]  However, they also never mandated masks.
[02:31:03.759 --> 02:31:08.464]  And now they're starting to actually impose some mask suggestions now.
[02:31:08.464 --> 02:31:11.508]  And of course, we can see where that slippery slope leads, of course.
[02:31:11.508 --> 02:31:15.112]  So I get the sense... It's all you and Ron, and it's never going to end if we submit.
[02:31:15.112 --> 02:31:15.733]  It only gets tighter.
[02:31:16.013 --> 02:31:17.714]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[02:31:17.714 --> 02:31:39.124]  And then another, along those same lines, in terms of the gaslighting and the propaganda that they're using to convince us that Black Lives Matter protests helped slow the spread of coronavirus, another one is today that they've come out with a new study from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden saying that isolation made the Swedish elderly feel better, not worse.
[02:31:39.124 --> 02:31:44.166]  So they're claiming now that people's mental health that were kind of been isolated either in their homes...
[02:31:44.406 --> 02:31:48.350]  26 million Black Lives Matter marchers helped knock down COVID-19.
[02:31:48.350 --> 02:31:49.111]  Right, exactly.
[02:31:49.111 --> 02:31:50.132]  And 2 plus 2 equals 1.
[02:31:50.132 --> 02:31:50.552]  Right.
[02:31:50.552 --> 02:31:53.636]  And war is peace and slavery is freedom.
[02:31:53.636 --> 02:32:03.145]  So, yeah, they're putting out studies now saying that older folks benefited from being in isolation, that they're happy, they're not worrying about their finances, that they're not worried about getting ill.
[02:32:03.145 --> 02:32:05.267]  I think we know that that's certainly not the case.
[02:32:05.267 --> 02:32:06.469]  Unbelievable next-level lying.
[02:32:08.295 --> 02:32:09.136]  It never ends.
[02:32:09.136 --> 02:32:09.837]  Never ends.
[02:32:09.837 --> 02:32:15.103]  Well, Austin quietly passed a resolution that we're staying locked down until December 31st.
[02:32:15.103 --> 02:32:18.107]  That's just hidden in the article about $2,000 fines for not wearing a mask.
[02:32:18.956 --> 02:32:25.380]  Yes, and in Michigan, the governor there just today announced that they're doing $500 fines for masks, and that's statewide.
[02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:33.865]  So if you don't abide by the mask law... And this is the crazy woman that, again, ordered people that did have the flu, did have COVID, did have pneumonia, into nursing homes.
[02:32:33.865 --> 02:32:42.209]  And we have videos of, like, 18-year-old mental patients beating up white people because they're white, and blood splattering everywhere, and then giving them COVID and everything else.
[02:32:42.209 --> 02:32:43.090]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:44.591]  The scam runs deep.
[02:32:44.591 --> 02:32:48.855]  And also, her husband was caught trying to get his boat in the water early before everyone else.
[02:32:48.855 --> 02:32:51.017]  He said, it doesn't matter, I'm the governor.
[02:32:51.017 --> 02:32:51.577]  Husband.
[02:32:51.577 --> 02:32:52.478]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:32:52.478 --> 02:32:54.740]  And then they managed to get away with that as well, so.
[02:32:54.740 --> 02:32:58.803]  Well, what was great is that people, the boat doc said, we don't want your boat, come get your boat and went public with it.
[02:32:58.803 --> 02:32:59.964]  And they blew him out of the water.
[02:32:59.964 --> 02:33:01.506]  Because this is what needs to happen.
[02:33:01.506 --> 02:33:05.209]  We need to stop giving service to leftists and a globalist and anything else.
[02:33:05.209 --> 02:33:10.794]  Like, you see Abbott at a restaurant, you own it, say, get your ass and get the hell out of here.
[02:33:11.482 --> 02:33:13.023]  Get the hell out of here.
[02:33:13.023 --> 02:33:14.863]  Go get on your knees in the New World Order.
[02:33:14.863 --> 02:33:15.564]  Anybody.
[02:33:15.564 --> 02:33:16.724]  We don't shop with leftists.
[02:33:16.724 --> 02:33:17.645]  We don't support them.
[02:33:17.645 --> 02:33:18.785]  They want to take our bank accounts.
[02:33:18.785 --> 02:33:19.765]  They want to suppress us.
[02:33:19.765 --> 02:33:20.846]  They want to dominate us.
[02:33:20.846 --> 02:33:21.906]  Then they want war?
[02:33:21.906 --> 02:33:23.027]  They're going to get it.
[02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:25.268]  Ostracize them out of your lives.
[02:33:25.268 --> 02:33:28.189]  Let them know they can burn in hell.
[02:33:28.189 --> 02:33:30.590]  We're going to come back and tell you what the enemy's up to.
[02:33:33.004 --> 02:33:38.408]  One of the best nutrients nature has provided, beetroot, has been used for hundreds of years in natural medicine.

[02:34:43.777 --> 02:34:48.483]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[02:34:49.164 --> 02:34:57.528]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[02:34:57.528 --> 02:35:17.398]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[02:35:18.058 --> 02:35:19.079]  Destinies.
[02:35:19.079 --> 02:35:26.022]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[02:35:26.022 --> 02:35:30.525]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[02:35:30.525 --> 02:35:32.626]  So take action, or be slaves!
[02:35:34.660 --> 02:35:48.579]  It's the end of the world as we know it It's the end of the world as we know it It's the end of the world as we know it I feel fine
[02:35:50.618 --> 02:35:55.243]  It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.
[02:35:55.243 --> 02:36:06.295]  This entire takeover has been battle-planned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[02:36:06.295 --> 02:36:08.377]  This is the post-human takeover.
[02:36:08.377 --> 02:36:12.061]  The noose gets tighter when you comply, not looser.
[02:36:12.842 --> 02:36:15.844]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax.
[02:36:15.844 --> 02:36:19.186]  Now they admit that, quote, death numbers are dropping because those are fake.
[02:36:19.186 --> 02:36:21.127]  Or they count people that died of something else.
[02:36:21.127 --> 02:36:22.928]  But it's all about how many cases there are.
[02:36:22.928 --> 02:36:26.750]  And now they're saying, most of the population will get it.
[02:36:26.750 --> 02:36:29.271]  And then no one can go outside ever again.
[02:36:29.271 --> 02:36:31.413]  It's totally insane.
[02:36:31.413 --> 02:36:32.553]  It's a fraud.
[02:36:32.553 --> 02:36:33.454]  It's all a lie.
[02:36:35.051 --> 02:36:37.654]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[02:36:37.654 --> 02:36:50.446]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[02:36:50.947 --> 02:36:51.667]  I think so.
[02:37:10.999 --> 02:37:14.980]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[02:37:14.980 --> 02:37:20.222]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[02:37:20.222 --> 02:37:28.485]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[02:37:28.485 --> 02:37:31.926]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[02:37:31.926 --> 02:37:37.608]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[02:37:37.608 --> 02:37:40.209]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:48.103 --> 02:37:54.268]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:10.256 --> 02:38:13.838]  I've been studying the United Nations, who set it up, how it operates for a long time.
[02:38:13.838 --> 02:38:15.960]  I know a lot of you have as well.
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:23.264]  And they tried to launch plans back in the 60s to disarm the military and the police and then only have a UN force around the world.
[02:38:23.264 --> 02:38:30.448]  And a lot of people ended up, you know, the government quietly having to be gotten rid of to stop that at that point.
[02:38:30.448 --> 02:38:36.732]  And you can go to the CIA website and look up State Department of Random 7277.
[02:38:36.732 --> 02:38:38.453]  If you type in State Department of Random 7277,
[02:38:40.251 --> 02:39:03.851]  You'll notice it'll pop up on Wikipedia and places like that, but you can actually go to the CIA has got a flyer from 1963 about FBI agents and CIA operatives that were creating a newsletter called On Target about a list of people in the government that they were planning to kill if they continue to go along with the plan.
[02:39:03.851 --> 02:39:08.275]  So the government knows all about this ongoing battle
[02:39:09.448 --> 02:39:10.549]  And this ongoing fight.
[02:39:10.549 --> 02:39:19.013]  And we would have already been under this a long time ago if there hadn't been a quiet, hot war inside the federal government.
[02:39:19.013 --> 02:39:22.195]  And people got killed on both sides, just so you know.
[02:39:22.195 --> 02:39:23.676]  Just so you know.
[02:39:23.676 --> 02:39:28.718]  And I'll tell you, Texas led the operations against it.
[02:39:28.718 --> 02:39:31.400]  And I grew up hearing about this.
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:32.460]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:35.822]  Just little things here, little things there about what went on.
[02:39:35.822 --> 02:39:37.603]  Now, let's talk about this right now.
[02:39:37.603 --> 02:39:38.824]  Let's look at this fella right here.
[02:39:40.091 --> 02:39:49.336]  This is Jonathan Greenblatt, and he worked directly as special counsel to President Barack Obama.
[02:39:49.336 --> 02:39:59.541]  So when you look at this guy, you're looking at President Barack H. Obama.
[02:39:59.541 --> 02:40:01.162]  Now, Mr. Greenblatt heads up the
[02:40:02.463 --> 02:40:04.405]  Anti-Defamation League.
[02:40:04.405 --> 02:40:10.731]  And anyone that doesn't want to turn their guns in, anyone that doesn't want open borders, anybody that doesn't want the UN to run their lives, they're an anti-Semite.
[02:40:10.731 --> 02:40:12.212]  Trump's an anti-Semite.
[02:40:12.212 --> 02:40:21.501]  Now the truth is, we know that Jews are a diverse group of views and ideas, and I'm not against Israel, I'm not against Jews, I'm not going to be sucked in to being in this whole thing, okay?
[02:40:21.501 --> 02:40:27.166]  The point is, is that Greenblatt comes out and says I'm anti-Semitic, because I even exist, okay?
[02:40:27.166 --> 02:40:28.007]  Now let's talk about this.
[02:40:29.295 --> 02:40:32.278]  Can ADL stop the hate by embracing Al Sharpton?
[02:40:32.278 --> 02:40:33.318]  Big articles are out.
[02:40:33.318 --> 02:40:37.102]  Al Sharpton's a guy that actually has attacked Jews and said Jews are bad.
[02:40:37.102 --> 02:40:39.384]  But he's good, you see.
[02:40:39.384 --> 02:40:40.505]  Radical Islam's good.
[02:40:40.505 --> 02:40:43.247]  I mean, the ADL now is not even really pro-Israel.
[02:40:43.247 --> 02:40:45.469]  Because they understand this is about globalism.
[02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:46.950]  Continue.
[02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:52.615]  ADL CEO under fire for partying with Al Sharpton is pushing for Facebook boycott.
[02:40:52.615 --> 02:40:54.697]  Can ADL stop the hate by embracing Al Sharpton?
[02:40:56.206 --> 02:41:02.811]  Facebook's own civil rights auditors say the policy decisions are a tremendous setback and recommend they follow the ADL's directives.
[02:41:02.811 --> 02:41:04.472]  The ADL says they want their trainers.
[02:41:06.104 --> 02:41:09.486]  To not just train Facebook censors, but be in charge.
[02:41:09.486 --> 02:41:12.868]  Letter to the New York Times regarding Alex Jones' removal from social media.
[02:41:12.868 --> 02:41:21.373]  He goes on to say, I'm an anti-Semite because I said gay groups and some leftist Jewish groups did obviously dress up at different events.
[02:41:21.373 --> 02:41:24.595]  Some of the white supremacists, our left is posing as that.
[02:41:24.595 --> 02:41:25.675]  We catch them all the time.
[02:41:25.675 --> 02:41:28.477]  The left does Jussie Smollett stuff.
[02:41:28.477 --> 02:41:29.758]  I mean, that's what Barrett does.
[02:41:31.039 --> 02:41:36.104]  Sacha Baron Cohen goes around and poses as an anti-Jewish guy and gets people to join in.
[02:41:36.104 --> 02:41:39.887]  I mean, he's saying this doesn't exist, so I should be taken off the internet.
[02:41:39.887 --> 02:41:44.551]  He calls for me in the New York Times to be censored two years ago and said it was a good thing because I lied.
[02:41:44.551 --> 02:41:46.893]  I mean, I didn't lie.
[02:41:46.893 --> 02:41:53.079]  That's what Sacha Baron Cohen, that did your keynote address, poses all the time as an anti-Semite to set people up.
[02:41:53.079 --> 02:41:57.023]  I mean, but even though I was lying, I have a right to free speech, but it's you, Mr.
[02:41:59.565 --> 02:42:01.066]  Mr. Greenblatt is doing this.
[02:42:01.066 --> 02:42:02.187]  ADL statement on Facebook.
[02:42:02.187 --> 02:42:06.610]  Decision to remove Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones, and other bigots from platform.
[02:42:06.610 --> 02:42:06.970]  Here's this.
[02:42:06.970 --> 02:42:12.473]  College threatens to revoke students admission after viral pro-Trump TikTok video.
[02:42:12.473 --> 02:42:14.775]  She just said, I love Trump and I don't care what you say.
[02:42:14.775 --> 02:42:15.635]  He's a great president.
[02:42:15.635 --> 02:42:20.278]  They're now saying they're going to take away her high school diploma as she goes to college.
[02:42:20.278 --> 02:42:22.260]  The road to human rights in Iran.
[02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:23.180]  Are we there yet?
[02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:23.801]  Here's, uh,
[02:42:26.783 --> 02:42:38.213]  Here's Jonathan Greenblatt's wife, a refugee from Iranian tyranny, and she writes articles with an image of her with red tape over her mouth, how the regime doesn't let you have speech and censors.
[02:42:38.213 --> 02:42:51.245]  So his wife runs around as a human rights activist, and gets all this money through groups to try to have regime change in Iran, which I'm all for, but then by day, and then by night, her husband is just as bad as the regime.
[02:42:51.245 --> 02:42:52.106]  Just pointing that out.
[02:42:54.554 --> 02:42:56.375]  Now, I want to get Dan Lyman's take on this.
[02:42:56.375 --> 02:42:59.898]  I'm going to get into the serious documents in the next hour of the U.N.
[02:42:59.898 --> 02:43:11.966]  Replacement Plan, a super racist plan against white people, and how this operation is going to work and how it's run by the U.N., and how the ADL says if you talk about it, they will, quote, purge you, though I'm going to show you the official U.N.
[02:43:11.966 --> 02:43:14.387]  documents from their website, word for word.
[02:43:14.387 --> 02:43:15.528]  Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com.
[02:43:15.528 --> 02:43:16.489]  Do you have any comments on this?
[02:43:17.029 --> 02:43:24.451]  Well, I think this is the kind of stuff that we can look forward to in a Biden presidency, given that they're going to have all these kinds of people just re-embedded in the administration there.
[02:43:24.451 --> 02:43:31.473]  And what I think is amazing is that these people, they will blanket attack an entire group of people just for being white.
[02:43:31.473 --> 02:43:42.496]  But if you attack a single individual for having poor policy or being flat out evil, you know, most recently we saw we can't even talk poorly about Tammy Duckworth because she lost her legs, unfortunately.
[02:43:42.496 --> 02:43:43.697]  So, I mean, they will find
[02:43:45.061 --> 02:43:49.947]  Any reason why we can't- She can say, dismantle America, that whites are evil, and we can't respond back.
[02:43:49.947 --> 02:43:50.247]  Right.
[02:43:50.247 --> 02:43:52.831]  We can't even attack an individual- She's a racist pig!
[02:43:53.942 --> 02:43:55.944]  But they can attack an entire group of people.
[02:43:55.944 --> 02:43:58.066]  The truth is they're a bunch of racists, okay?
[02:43:58.066 --> 02:43:59.887]  So I don't think the ADL represents Jews.
[02:43:59.887 --> 02:44:01.188]  There are a lot of good Jews.
[02:44:01.188 --> 02:44:03.290]  I've had Jews, you know, help me out with things.
[02:44:03.290 --> 02:44:08.615]  I mean, a Band-Op video was designed by a guy from Israel, great guy, didn't like us being censored, helped us build it.
[02:44:08.615 --> 02:44:10.456]  And then it was like, here, it's done, have it.
[02:44:10.456 --> 02:44:12.458]  I mean, there's so many examples.
[02:44:12.458 --> 02:44:16.762]  I'm not going to have the ADL trick me into hating Jews because they make money off that.
[02:44:17.287 --> 02:44:26.211]  Yeah, and they're sowing division across the board between everyone for every little infraction or anything we said ten years ago or whatever.
[02:44:26.211 --> 02:44:34.535]  So, sowing division within groups, between groups, and I think that's obviously the endgame is just have everybody fighting with each other while they make their moves.
[02:44:34.535 --> 02:44:35.035]  Exactly.
[02:44:35.035 --> 02:44:39.638]  He's a hired contractor to just come in and create total division.
[02:44:39.638 --> 02:44:42.019]  That's what it seems like.
[02:44:42.019 --> 02:44:42.899]  Let's continue here.
[02:44:42.899 --> 02:44:44.600]  Let me give people a little preview of what's coming up.
[02:44:47.253 --> 02:44:48.734]  Enabler the Carnegie Plan.
[02:44:48.734 --> 02:44:56.160]  200 million Africans will live in Europe after 30 years of migration.
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:59.822]  Melania Trump statue in Slovenia torn down.
[02:44:59.822 --> 02:45:03.845]  President Macron vows to flood Europe with millions of African migrants.
[02:45:03.845 --> 02:45:07.088]  He says 150 million just for France alone.
[02:45:07.088 --> 02:45:10.450]  UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[02:45:10.450 --> 02:45:12.392]  Infowars.com.
[02:45:12.392 --> 02:45:13.192]  Direct links.
[02:45:14.266 --> 02:45:19.089]  to the UN website, where they officially say that's the policy, but you've already seen it implemented.
[02:45:19.089 --> 02:45:22.872]  Dems officially propose giving entire world migrant asylum in the US.
[02:45:22.872 --> 02:45:33.760]  That is the latest article that came out yesterday, and we actually show you the Democratic Party now saying that that is actually their policy.
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:45.451]  That their policy in the new platform with Joe Biden has adopted the idea of no borders, no walls, and to bring unlimited, quote, migrants in, and that the UN's in charge of it.
[02:45:46.209 --> 02:45:50.371]  And they tell us that it's inevitable, that it has to happen, there's no stopping it.
[02:45:50.371 --> 02:45:56.354]  But these are the same people that tell us we can actually change the climate of the planet if we, you know, give up this and give up that.
[02:45:56.354 --> 02:46:01.617]  So they say we can actually, we can fight God, essentially, fight God's creation.
[02:46:01.617 --> 02:46:08.600]  But at the same time, we can't even defend our borders from humans who are very, you know, you can prevent them from crossing borders if you really want to.
[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:13.463]  As they've proven throughout this, the whole coronavirus thing, they've actually managed to seal down a lot of the borders pretty well.
[02:46:14.203 --> 02:46:23.847]  But they tell us that it's inevitable that hundreds of millions of people from the third world are going to flood into our countries in a very short period of time, and there's just nothing that they can do about it.
[02:46:23.847 --> 02:46:32.730]  And this is official, and this is happening, and then when it's in the official UN website, they look at us and tell us we're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[02:46:32.730 --> 02:46:35.972]  When it's an official plan happening, we can look out our window and see.
[02:46:37.028 --> 02:46:44.246]  And they're telling the migrants whites are inherently bad, so whites being beaten up and attacked by people from all over the world is up multi-thousand percentage points.
[02:46:44.932 --> 02:46:49.955]  And weaponizing a lot of these people who do come in and then rise up through the ranks of power.
[02:46:49.955 --> 02:46:51.436]  Ilhan Omar is one great example.
[02:46:51.436 --> 02:46:53.418]  But you have people like that in Sweden as well.
[02:46:53.418 --> 02:47:05.706]  You have a very similar character in Sweden, who is a migrant refugee from another, from an African country, who is basically there now saying, leading this charge, the Black Lives Matter movement there, saying that Sweden is a bastion of whiteness and needs to be torn down.
[02:47:05.706 --> 02:47:06.787]  Yeah, so exactly.
[02:47:06.787 --> 02:47:08.868]  Now they're saying the countryside is too white in England.
[02:47:08.868 --> 02:47:10.990]  We've got to force people out there and take their homes.
[02:47:12.343 --> 02:47:26.511]  And saying the existence of white is evil, and it needs to be purged, and then the ADL is up there saying, we're going to purge anybody and put them in prison if they say there's a plan to bring in 600 million people and force whites to just die.
[02:47:26.511 --> 02:47:28.192]  I mean, it's genocide.
[02:47:28.192 --> 02:47:31.394]  It's actual Hitlerian activity.
[02:47:31.394 --> 02:47:35.596]  The only thing I see Hitlerian right now is the United Nations and this replacement migration plan.
[02:47:37.165 --> 02:47:50.729]  And if people want to see, if they want to look at a glimpse into the future, just look at what has gone down in South Africa in the past couple of decades and the way that people are being dispossessed of their land simply for being white and the attacks that are carried out on them are unbelievably heinous.
[02:47:50.729 --> 02:47:52.909]  Some of the worst things I've ever seen or read.
[02:47:52.909 --> 02:47:54.510]  And that's simply just for being white.
[02:47:54.510 --> 02:48:00.411]  So people need to look at that, take a good hard look, examine it, and see that this is already coming.
[02:48:00.411 --> 02:48:03.092]  And realize the ADL stands for Adolf Defense League.
[02:48:03.885 --> 02:48:11.053]  Because they're just taking the ideas of Hitler, racially, and turning it all the way around, but then the ADL will direct it all.
[02:48:11.053 --> 02:48:14.097]  I mean, that's literally what the ADL is saying.
[02:48:14.097 --> 02:48:16.079]  It's the closest thing to Hitler I've ever seen.
[02:48:16.079 --> 02:48:20.525]  We will purge you, we will imprison you for your speech, we are in command, we rule you now.
[02:48:23.453 --> 02:48:30.576]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning, and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[02:48:30.576 --> 02:48:39.519]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese, walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[02:48:39.519 --> 02:48:44.281]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up, and the woman stops and points at me.
[02:48:44.281 --> 02:48:47.562]  So they stop, and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[02:48:47.562 --> 02:48:49.802]  Truck started, and they sit there and stretch.
[02:48:49.802 --> 02:48:50.603]  She keeps pointing.
[02:48:51.263 --> 02:48:53.272]  And they put their hands out like they're waiting for me.
[02:48:54.588 --> 02:48:59.029]  To go, because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[02:48:59.029 --> 02:49:02.990]  And so then I just sat there, so they acted angry and walked past me.
[02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:08.291]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[02:49:08.291 --> 02:49:09.311]  This is mental illness.
[02:49:09.311 --> 02:49:12.872]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[02:49:12.872 --> 02:49:14.312]  This is all cult programming.
[02:49:14.312 --> 02:49:15.873]  This is all about submitting.
[02:49:15.873 --> 02:49:18.713]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[02:49:18.713 --> 02:49:20.113]  It's all a giant fraud.
[02:49:20.113 --> 02:49:22.394]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[02:49:24.494 --> 02:49:29.375]  We need to get back to the land, back to self-sufficiency, and back to being prepared.
[02:49:29.375 --> 02:49:38.558]  And the way to start, ladies and gentlemen, is having friends and family with a bug-out plan if there is a total collapse, and water filtration, and food to last you at least a few months.
[02:49:38.558 --> 02:49:41.078]  And the food we have is very high quality.
[02:49:41.078 --> 02:49:43.799]  It's in great containers that are great to be mobile.
[02:49:43.799 --> 02:49:46.360]  They have wide selections, special diets, you name it.
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:47.900]  It's the best price you're going to find.
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:51.943]  You need to get the orders in now, in the lull before the storm.
[02:49:51.943 --> 02:49:53.765]  I told you lockdown two was coming.
[02:49:53.765 --> 02:49:55.666]  The new world order is making its move.
[02:49:55.666 --> 02:49:59.489]  Whether Trump loses or wins, things are just going to get more crazy.
[02:49:59.489 --> 02:50:02.912]  And this food lasts 25 years inside the containers.
[02:50:02.912 --> 02:50:09.618]  So it's something you can hide, something you can bury, something you know is an ace in the hole for you and your family in the future.
[02:50:09.618 --> 02:50:14.502]  And the little bit of profit that comes in funds the info war to continue to warn the people.
[02:50:14.842 --> 02:50:27.114]  So you're also funding InfoWars, the most powerful Paul Revere organization in the world, and it's powered by you!
[02:50:27.114 --> 02:50:29.756]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:50:38.167 --> 02:50:39.088]  We're good to go.
[02:51:00.282 --> 02:51:00.462]  I don't
[02:51:22.314 --> 02:51:25.416]  But you understand the mathematical equation of deception.
[02:51:25.416 --> 02:51:28.518]  This is what big corporations want is to divide us all against each other.
[02:51:28.518 --> 02:51:42.008]  And so those of us that are actually trying to unify people together around the Americana, free market, Christian ethos, we are under attack because we're running a parallel system that is better than this and the authoritarians don't like it.
[02:51:42.008 --> 02:51:43.609]  And so they know it's a fraud.
[02:51:43.609 --> 02:51:44.970]  They know we're not Nazis.
[02:51:44.970 --> 02:51:48.293]  And they're using Nazi tactics of cutting off bank accounts.
[02:51:49.244 --> 02:51:50.585]  Look at Laura Loomer.
[02:51:50.585 --> 02:51:53.286]  She's pro-Israel, Jewish lady, pro-freedom.
[02:51:53.286 --> 02:52:01.910]  She's had all the Airbnbs and Uber and PayPal and all of them blacklist her and gang up on her to show her.
[02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:05.712]  That's the most Nazi-like behavior in the ADL.
[02:52:05.712 --> 02:52:07.333]  I mean, that's Hitler behavior.
[02:52:07.333 --> 02:52:09.554]  And now they want to put us in jail.
[02:52:09.554 --> 02:52:10.594]  I mean, why?
[02:52:10.594 --> 02:52:12.195]  My grandfather was both in World War II.
[02:52:12.195 --> 02:52:14.236]  Why do you want to put me in jail?
[02:52:14.236 --> 02:52:16.417]  Why does Jonathan Greenblatt want to put me in jail?
[02:52:16.417 --> 02:52:17.418]  Because he's a monster.
[02:52:18.257 --> 02:52:20.318]  The ADL attacking a fellow Jewish woman.
[02:52:20.318 --> 02:52:21.878]  It really is incredible.
[02:52:21.878 --> 02:52:26.259]  And you know what you're saying about the way that they really just hammer anyone who speaks out against it.
[02:52:26.259 --> 02:52:29.520]  I get a lot of people ask me, why are the Swedes allowing this to happen to their country?
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:32.301]  Why are the Germans allowing this to happen to their country?
[02:52:32.301 --> 02:52:37.002]  Because anyone who speaks out against it at all, especially in Germany, the propaganda is non-stop.
[02:52:37.002 --> 02:52:40.843]  If you've been stabbed and a black dude did it, you say a black dude stabbed me, you're arrested.
[02:52:41.363 --> 02:52:47.287]  Right, and in Germany the propaganda is non-stop from the mainstream media and from the government.
[02:52:47.287 --> 02:52:53.510]  And that's because they never got out from under the occupation during the reconstruction of the Marshall Plan.
[02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:56.552]  It's not America that runs it, it's the Ford Foundation Carnegie Endowment.
[02:52:58.190 --> 02:52:59.811]  And there is no free speech there.
[02:52:59.811 --> 02:53:05.652]  And that's one of the reasons why it is happening there almost unchecked because no one's even allowed to talk about it.
[02:53:05.652 --> 02:53:13.795]  So that's why I recommend everyone here in the United States, we have a lot of issues facing us here between coronavirus, between migration, between this culture war.
[02:53:14.455 --> 02:53:20.523]  You still have the right to speak up, and if people don't exercise that right, it's going to die, and it is dying.
[02:53:20.523 --> 02:53:22.907]  So people really do need to speak up right now.
[02:53:22.907 --> 02:53:31.959]  Everyone needs to be speaking up en masse, because that's the only recourse that we have right now before the next phase, and it's not going to be pretty if people don't speak up soon.
[02:53:32.219 --> 02:53:33.380]  It's very simple.
[02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:39.283]  The powers that be, the Southern Providence Law Center, the ADL, the NAACP, they're all the same program.
[02:53:39.283 --> 02:53:42.945]  They're casting America as Hitler and they're Captain America.
[02:53:42.945 --> 02:53:47.187]  And I see leftists hit a woman in the head with a club just because she's going to a Trump event.
[02:53:47.187 --> 02:53:48.748]  And they go, she's a Nazi.
[02:53:48.748 --> 02:53:51.750]  It's an excuse for them to act bad and do bad things.
[02:53:51.750 --> 02:53:54.571]  Just like Hitler said, because you're a Jew, I can do something to you.
[02:53:54.571 --> 02:53:57.493]  Well, I refuse to sink to the level of Hitler, ADL, but you've done it.
[02:53:58.342 --> 02:54:03.164]  Dehumanizing everyone, and at this point we've lost our... They're literally Hitler-like!
[02:54:03.164 --> 02:54:06.326]  I mean, Jonathan Greenblatt is the closest thing to Hitler I've ever seen!
[02:54:06.326 --> 02:54:08.006]  It's unbelievable!
[02:54:08.006 --> 02:54:13.048]  I mean, can you believe these people?
[02:54:13.048 --> 02:54:15.369]  The nerve, man!
[02:54:15.369 --> 02:54:18.151]  It's... Sasha Barrett-Cohen says, we're gonna arrest you!
[02:54:18.151 --> 02:54:22.212]  And then he lies about what I said, when he's talking about having me arrested!
[02:54:22.212 --> 02:54:24.994]  The Ernid Leldred Zion crap!
[02:54:25.982 --> 02:54:33.387]  Notice that's what he pushes so that when Jews get persecuted because of what he's pushing, then he'll be their savior.
[02:54:33.387 --> 02:54:34.788]  Very simple.
[02:54:34.788 --> 02:54:38.991]  And we're not allowed to even defend ourselves when they slander and say that we say things that we didn't.
[02:54:38.991 --> 02:54:42.734]  You're not even allowed to correct the record.
[02:54:42.734 --> 02:54:52.001]  Why do Americans, because we defeated Hitler and protected the ADL like Abe Foxman, why does Abe Foxman hate America so much?
[02:54:52.001 --> 02:54:52.201]  Why?
[02:54:54.301 --> 02:54:55.081]  I don't have the answer.
[02:54:55.081 --> 02:54:55.582]  I wish I knew.
[02:54:55.582 --> 02:54:57.603]  And what did I do to him?
[02:54:57.603 --> 02:55:00.444]  They've been calling me a Nazi for 25 years for no reason.
[02:55:00.444 --> 02:55:02.425]  Because they want me to hate them.
[02:55:02.425 --> 02:55:03.485]  They want me to attack them.
[02:55:03.485 --> 02:55:04.666]  They want me to attack Jews.
[02:55:04.666 --> 02:55:06.187]  And I'm not going to do it.
[02:55:06.187 --> 02:55:07.347]  But I will attack you.
[02:55:07.347 --> 02:55:08.988]  I will expose your ass.
[02:55:08.988 --> 02:55:10.749]  And I'm sure they'll just torture me more.
[02:55:10.749 --> 02:55:11.589]  You know?
[02:55:11.589 --> 02:55:12.209]  It's all funny.
[02:55:12.209 --> 02:55:18.732]  Just the smugness of these lawyers sitting up there in judgment of us like they're God.
[02:55:18.732 --> 02:55:19.893]  Well, the people are waking up.
[02:55:21.144 --> 02:55:24.768]  Just know Facebook's now run by Jonathan Greenblatt and Obama.
[02:55:24.768 --> 02:55:29.753]  I mean, when you see this, this is just Obama, an Islamic extremist hiding behind a Jew.
[02:55:32.697 --> 02:55:34.358]  It's finally here!
[02:55:34.358 --> 02:55:38.481]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[02:56:44.232 --> 02:56:47.894]  Well, I'm going to end my part of this transmission with Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com.
[02:56:47.894 --> 02:56:49.474]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:56:49.474 --> 02:56:54.997]  Before Dr. Nick Begich, one of the pioneers exposing the PSYOP, comes on.
[02:56:54.997 --> 02:57:00.339]  Where I begin, Obama, Hillary, the Deep State, they're the ones funding radical Islam.
[02:57:00.339 --> 02:57:05.561]  They're the ones having the ADL now literally put on symposiums and backing radical Islam.
[02:57:05.561 --> 02:57:10.083]  I mean, the ADL's been bought out by radical Islam and the globalists.
[02:57:10.083 --> 02:57:10.744]  They're the ones.
[02:57:12.051 --> 02:57:19.753]  Obama and the globalists that have the Washington Post saying Trump could lose and not leave, but cabinet members who try to help him face prison.
[02:57:19.753 --> 02:57:23.534]  And I've got the CFR saying they may remove him before or during the election.
[02:57:23.534 --> 02:57:27.536]  So if Trump challenges the results, Democrats say they already are.
[02:57:27.536 --> 02:57:32.197]  If he challenges them, they say that the Pentagon will arrest him or they will arrest them.
[02:57:32.197 --> 02:57:35.518]  So now again, it's not just the ADL saying
[02:57:36.718 --> 02:57:42.323]  Take Alex Jones off the air, Zuckerberg do what we say or we'll arrest you, we'll purge you using Nazi stuff.
[02:57:42.323 --> 02:57:45.306]  Nazi, I mean, why are you going to purge me?
[02:57:45.306 --> 02:57:47.228]  Wow, that's wonderful.
[02:57:47.228 --> 02:57:48.910]  You're so nice, let me know what you say.
[02:57:48.910 --> 02:57:50.591]  Now they're telling the brass.
[02:57:50.591 --> 02:57:57.618]  Now the Washington Post, like I said, Jeff Bezos is saying, so they're all in lockstep, a bunch of articles gearing up for this.
[02:57:57.618 --> 02:57:57.979]  What do we do?
[02:57:59.881 --> 02:58:00.622]  It's going to get ugly.
[02:58:00.622 --> 02:58:07.085]  I mean, it got so ugly at the 2016 election and we've had four more years of just pure insanity since then.
[02:58:07.085 --> 02:58:09.846]  So for 2020, it's going to be just crazy.
[02:58:09.846 --> 02:58:19.130]  But I think one of the things that the Trump administration should really be focused on, and it doesn't seem like they are no matter how much they talk about it, is that they're not focusing on tech censorship.
[02:58:19.130 --> 02:58:27.014]  And they're allowing so many of their supporters to be silenced and basically de-platformed, de-personed, and all these people are going to be gone.
[02:58:27.014 --> 02:58:28.955]  If Trump loses, it's his fault.
[02:58:29.878 --> 02:58:40.926]  Yeah, there's going to be no one there to expose the truth, to fight on behalf of a fair election, which I think was really, really critical for the 2016 election.
[02:58:40.926 --> 02:58:50.752]  There were still enough voices out there exposing fraud, rallying around, getting good information out there, and trying to expose that they were going to try to steal the election.
[02:58:50.752 --> 02:58:55.656]  And that might not work this time because there are so many people now that have been wiped off the internet, essentially.
[02:58:56.104 --> 02:59:00.947]  Well that's right, and I know Trump cares about his supporters, I know he cares about censorship.
[02:59:00.947 --> 02:59:03.669]  They stymie him, they lie to him, they say it's not going on.
[02:59:03.669 --> 02:59:06.831]  He tells the Justice Department to go in there and do something.
[02:59:06.831 --> 02:59:09.233]  They spin their wheels with investigations.
[02:59:09.233 --> 02:59:12.355]  And so he's sitting there, he calls them in, he meets with them, he says stop.
[02:59:12.355 --> 02:59:14.377]  They don't stop, they don't respect him, they're belligerent.
[02:59:15.191 --> 02:59:27.097]  And so now, we sit here and get mad at Trump, you know, he should have, the real power he had, is what Caller said years ago, he should have moved to Parler, he should have started his own Twitter, they would have backed off right at that point.
[02:59:27.097 --> 02:59:34.320]  But now, with 115 days left, he's doing more speeches, more rallies, he's killing himself, but almost no one carries it.
[02:59:34.320 --> 02:59:41.003]  And before they carried it because it got high ratings, but now they're sacrificing ratings because they can block it online.
[02:59:41.003 --> 02:59:42.484]  They didn't want online to get the coverage.
[02:59:43.084 --> 02:59:56.932]  So now we try to stream, and we know people that, you know, do, and we have folks that work behind the scenes, I'll leave it at that, and we've got a few tentacles out there nobody knows about, and we know other broadcasting groups, you know, like Right Side, there's dozens of them, that now Trump's speeches for six months are blocked!
[02:59:56.932 --> 02:59:58.373]  They don't let him get out!
[02:59:58.373 --> 03:00:06.957]  So they don't show much of his speeches on TV, they don't show much of his speeches online, and Trump allowed himself to be cut off from his supply line!
[03:00:06.957 --> 03:00:07.618]  Communication!
[03:00:08.462 --> 03:00:13.505]  And they're finding ways, he can't even hold his rallies at this point, or can't effectively hold them.
[03:00:13.505 --> 03:00:17.348]  Oh, it's his fault there's COVID, but the Democrat rallies are good.
[03:00:17.348 --> 03:00:20.730]  Right, and they've just cancelled tomorrow's New Hampshire rally as well, if I'm not mistaken.
[03:00:20.730 --> 03:00:21.231]  I missed that.
[03:00:21.231 --> 03:00:24.813]  Due to weather, but there's going to be something coming up every time now at this point.
[03:00:24.813 --> 03:00:25.834]  Well, he's being sabotaged.
[03:00:25.834 --> 03:00:31.138]  Let me tell you, the way they harass me, they harass thousands of people seen as in the upper support of Trump.
[03:00:31.138 --> 03:00:35.721]  They are buying off and harassing everybody, and it's just down to a handful of people.
[03:00:35.721 --> 03:00:37.322]  And they know Tucker Carlson can't be bought.
[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:41.445]  And that's why they, you know, there was already talk of him being a VP or something like that.
[03:00:41.445 --> 03:00:44.830]  That's why they had David Duke come out and endorse him to discredit that.
[03:00:44.830 --> 03:00:45.731]  But it's very sophisticated.
[03:00:46.397 --> 03:00:47.338]  It is, definitely.
[03:00:47.338 --> 03:00:52.141]  And the Trump administration and the campaign need to get more sophisticated as well.
[03:00:52.141 --> 03:01:01.027]  They need to really clean house there at the campaign because it's not gaining much traction, especially with people who are looking for some hope now in these crazy times.
[03:01:01.027 --> 03:01:05.591]  Well, Jared Kushner's being sidelined and so is Brad Parscale and all the rest of them.
[03:01:05.591 --> 03:01:07.352]  I mean, I know people that know Brad Parscale.
[03:01:07.352 --> 03:01:09.894]  He actually believes he got Trump elected.
[03:01:09.894 --> 03:01:11.415]  He actually thinks that.
[03:01:11.415 --> 03:01:13.096]  He thinks if they run Google ads, they're going to win.
[03:01:14.212 --> 03:01:18.774]  Which is just not the case, because all these platforms are purging Trump ads.
[03:01:18.774 --> 03:01:23.937]  So, I mean, thinking that you can rely on big tech to run ads and get the word out about the campaign is just not going to work.
[03:01:23.937 --> 03:01:26.158]  That's not going to work at all.
[03:01:26.158 --> 03:01:27.419]  Trump needs a big splash.
[03:01:27.419 --> 03:01:28.980]  He needs to pull something really, really big.
[03:01:28.980 --> 03:01:35.383]  I mean, look, Brad Parscale should not be buying two or three houses and four or five Lamborghinis.
[03:01:35.383 --> 03:01:37.304]  And I know a lot of people that know him, they have parties with him.
[03:01:37.304 --> 03:01:38.665]  He screws off a lot.
[03:01:38.665 --> 03:01:39.966]  He should not be screwing off any.
[03:01:40.816 --> 03:01:42.798]  He speaks very little.
[03:01:42.798 --> 03:01:49.407]  I mean, and they're all literally, Pascal's, people that know him again, he's like, oh, we'll have a Trump dynasty for 100 years, oh, we're gonna win.
[03:01:49.407 --> 03:01:51.930]  Delusional, delusional, they're all in a little bubble.
[03:01:55.796 --> 03:01:59.779]  I'm not just trying to attack Parscales or any of these people, but they're all just delusional.
[03:01:59.779 --> 03:02:01.241]  They're rolling over, you know?
[03:02:01.241 --> 03:02:02.882]  Yeah, I think they've gotten comfortable, too.
[03:02:02.882 --> 03:02:04.223]  They've been around for a few years now.
[03:02:04.223 --> 03:02:06.525]  The administration's been in place for almost four years.
[03:02:06.525 --> 03:02:07.466]  There's complacency.
[03:02:07.466 --> 03:02:12.530]  There's not that same hunger, that same fight that they had, you know, when they knew that they were up against all the odds.
[03:02:12.530 --> 03:02:16.574]  And they are still up against all the odds, but there's complacency, and that's created rot.
[03:02:16.574 --> 03:02:18.515]  And then Trump will figure out they stole it.
[03:02:18.515 --> 03:02:20.998]  He'll see the evidence, and the whole media is going to turn against him.
[03:02:21.701 --> 03:02:23.603]  And they're going to say he's insane, remove him.
[03:02:23.603 --> 03:02:30.290]  And they've got the Pentagon, they've all signaled, the top generals have all signaled they're going to throw him under the bus.
[03:02:30.290 --> 03:02:35.776]  Now, I know with some of the higher up people on the kind of the super deep state, the team below the deep state,
[03:02:36.605 --> 03:02:39.667]  That they say that's not going to be allowed to happen.
[03:02:39.667 --> 03:02:42.069]  They're going to go with what the actual vote is.
[03:02:42.069 --> 03:02:44.431]  So this could really be some fireworks.
[03:02:44.431 --> 03:02:45.171]  Definitely.
[03:02:45.171 --> 03:02:47.053]  And it's going to be so complicated with Corona.
[03:02:47.053 --> 03:02:53.057]  They're going to be flashing more and more, you know, increase in cases and they're going to really mess with the voting that way.
[03:02:53.057 --> 03:02:55.959]  And so I think they're going to really be messing with this election.
[03:02:55.959 --> 03:02:57.800]  They're going to be throwing everything they have at it.
[03:02:57.800 --> 03:03:00.903]  And people should be totally aware of that and be prepared.
[03:03:00.903 --> 03:03:03.084]  Well, the super deep state is the American people.
[03:03:03.084 --> 03:03:05.166]  And at the end of the day, we're where the rubber meets the road.
[03:03:06.772 --> 03:03:08.373]  Television has killed our people.
[03:03:08.373 --> 03:03:11.574]  Everybody, black, white, old, young, sits there and watches TV all day.
[03:03:11.574 --> 03:03:12.774]  You gotta get out of it.
[03:03:12.774 --> 03:03:14.855]  And they want you even less in your house.
[03:03:14.855 --> 03:03:20.397]  I mean, you know, they want you in your house while the leftists are all running around like cockroaches on the street.
[03:03:20.397 --> 03:03:22.158]  That means do the opposite of what they tell you.
[03:03:23.208 --> 03:03:24.990]  Absolutely.
[03:03:24.990 --> 03:03:29.715]  If the news tells you one thing, think the opposite, do the opposite, do your own research too.
[03:03:29.715 --> 03:03:38.924]  You know, I was actually going to bring this up really quick because it really pertains to what's going on here in Texas and what's going on with the supposed explosion in cases of coronavirus.
[03:03:39.504 --> 03:03:48.428]  And so it's, you know, the border states, we have Texas, Arizona, they're saying they have an explosion in cases there, and of course that's bringing in the new mandates, the new mask laws, the new fines.
[03:03:48.428 --> 03:04:08.417]  But one of the things that they're not reporting, and I've been tracking this, I run another website that we're tracking only immigration-related news at borderhawk.news, and so we've been tracking this for a couple weeks now, and the info is starting to come in more conclusively, and shockingly, even CNN reported on this recently, is that we have people coming across the border from Mexico in droves
[03:04:08.897 --> 03:04:09.097]  Just
[03:04:28.895 --> 03:04:35.483]  Absolutely, and even CNN has to admit that's true, and they won't tell anybody, hey, there's inhalable steroids that have a 100% knockout rate.
[03:04:35.483 --> 03:04:40.028]  Because it's all pre-programmed at the hospitals, you gotta put a tube down their throat.
[03:04:40.028 --> 03:04:43.272]  These poor Mexicans think they're coming here to get treatment, you're about to get your ass killed.
[03:04:44.130 --> 03:04:52.015]  Yeah, and they're really abusing the system as well, because it's probably not costing them anything, it's only costing... But notice, that's why nothing's for free.
[03:04:52.015 --> 03:04:54.556]  They're going right into a spider trap about to get killed.
[03:04:54.556 --> 03:04:59.419]  That hospital's going to get $52,000 of corona money to treat them.
[03:04:59.419 --> 03:05:00.420]  COVID-19 money.
[03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:10.126]  Which leads you to believe the hospitals are probably perfectly fine with accepting as many people as... That's why we got an ambulance for you, sweetheart, because we're going to put a tube down your throat, kill you, and take that taxpayer money.
[03:05:10.902 --> 03:05:14.584]  Yeah, and I think a lot of people would be shocked by the fact that you can come across the U.S.
[03:05:14.584 --> 03:05:19.046]  border, call 9-1-1, and be brought into a medical facility, and that's also happening in the U.K.
[03:05:19.046 --> 03:05:22.208]  They're coming across the English Channel, and as soon as they reach U.K.
[03:05:22.208 --> 03:05:23.989]  waters, they're actually calling the U.K.
[03:05:23.989 --> 03:05:26.170]  emergency line, and they're getting picked up that way.
[03:05:26.170 --> 03:05:31.972]  So our system is being totally overwhelmed, total Cloward and Piven style, and it's just... That's the plan.
[03:05:31.972 --> 03:05:34.834]  EuropeWars.com, and tell folks about your new great site.
[03:05:35.154 --> 03:05:37.117]  Yeah, borderhawk.news.
[03:05:37.117 --> 03:05:39.259]  I know people don't have time to be tracking all the news.
[03:05:39.259 --> 03:05:40.160]  Borderhawk.
[03:05:40.160 --> 03:05:41.402]  Borderhawk.news.
[03:05:41.402 --> 03:05:41.963]  Great name.
[03:05:41.963 --> 03:05:42.363]  Yep.
[03:05:42.363 --> 03:05:50.994]  And yeah, we're tracking specifically immigration-related stories and globalism, nationalism, and just mixing it all into one place because... Alright, great job.
[03:05:50.994 --> 03:05:52.996]  And you're on The War Room today?
[03:05:52.996 --> 03:05:53.357]  That's right.
[03:05:54.028 --> 03:05:55.590]  All right, well, that's Dan Lyman.
[03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:58.855]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:05:58.855 --> 03:06:00.016]  Nick Begich is coming up.
[03:06:00.016 --> 03:06:01.959]  I want to introduce him when we come back.
[03:06:01.959 --> 03:06:05.684]  And then again, the War Rooms will be hosted with Dan Lyman right here.
[03:06:05.684 --> 03:06:08.968]  And of course, Harrison Smith in studio with Savannah Hernandez.
[03:06:09.368 --> 03:06:13.451]  Because Owen is out in the field with a little surprise for everybody.
[03:06:13.451 --> 03:06:15.412]  So he's definitely a busy beaver.
[03:06:15.412 --> 03:06:18.474]  We're back with Dr. Nick Begich in T-Minus 4 minutes.
[03:06:18.474 --> 03:06:19.955]  Please let everybody you know, tune in.
[03:06:19.955 --> 03:06:27.020]  The man is a living legend exposing the architecture and technical scientific infrastructure of the New World Order.
[03:06:27.020 --> 03:06:29.021]  And he can help us take this sucker out.
[03:06:29.021 --> 03:06:29.381]  Stay with us.
[03:06:30.802 --> 03:06:34.304]  I am cutting this breaking announcement on July 9th.
[03:06:34.304 --> 03:06:38.405]  By Monday, we will have to end the biggest sale yet of the year.

[03:07:24.618 --> 03:07:25.999]  Where did it come from?
[03:07:25.999 --> 03:07:26.719]  Where did it come from?
[03:07:47.523 --> 03:07:49.725]  Infowarsstore.com.

[03:08:26.249 --> 03:08:32.790]  Other systems just don't compare.
[03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:35.391]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:42.461 --> 03:08:43.161]  Yeah.
[03:08:43.161 --> 03:09:02.172]  Here's our new single record from Highwayman's new album, Silver Stallion.
[03:09:02.172 --> 03:09:04.953]  Alright, I'm about to punch out of here and get to work on some other things.
[03:09:04.953 --> 03:09:07.795]  I'll be listening to Dr. Nick Baggish while I eat my lunch.
[03:09:07.795 --> 03:09:09.216]  And people always like Dr. Nick Baggish.
[03:09:09.216 --> 03:09:10.677]  I remember listening to him on Art Bell.
[03:09:12.261 --> 03:09:12.942]  26, 27 years ago.
[03:09:12.942 --> 03:09:14.802]  He was most popular guest on then.
[03:09:14.802 --> 03:09:16.663]  But lately people said, boy, he's really been on fire.
[03:09:16.663 --> 03:09:17.604]  So I don't want to cut into that.
[03:09:17.604 --> 03:09:19.424]  But I do have a question for him here in a moment.
[03:09:19.424 --> 03:09:28.508]  But first off, we're able to stay on air against all the Soros and DNC funded and Bloomberg funded and all the rest of it.
[03:09:28.508 --> 03:09:29.849]  Hillary Clinton funded lawsuits.
[03:09:29.849 --> 03:09:36.052]  We're able to go through all this and have reporters all over the United States and Europe and just really kick butt and break so many big stories.
[03:09:36.906 --> 03:09:45.490]  Because you've been supporting us, so I want to thank all the listeners and viewers for supporting us, and remind you, we've got the best water filtration, air filtration, high-quality, storable food you need.
[03:09:45.490 --> 03:09:47.011]  We've got store-wide free shipping.
[03:09:47.011 --> 03:09:48.292]  Double Patriot points right now.
[03:09:49.758 --> 03:09:51.559]  It has to end by Sunday or so.
[03:10:19.818 --> 03:10:22.121]  with the books and films of Dr. Nick Begich and the writings.
[03:10:22.121 --> 03:10:26.807]  We also carry some of his books and films at InfoWarsTore.com as well, so be sure and get those.
[03:10:26.807 --> 03:10:27.949]  Okay, Doc, here's my question.
[03:10:27.949 --> 03:10:29.451]  I know you got your own stuff to get into.
[03:10:29.451 --> 03:10:31.193]  I'll be listening.
[03:10:31.193 --> 03:10:34.277]  How do you handle the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL?
[03:10:35.855 --> 03:10:54.070]  When they constantly want to make things racial, just like the left, when that's not what I'm trying to do, and when they constantly try to attack and literally say, we're going to arrest you if you disagree with us, we're going to purge you, and then they defame you, and they're the closest thing I could find.
[03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:58.593]  The NAACP now does stuff like this.
[03:10:58.593 --> 03:11:00.455]  The left has gone psychotic.
[03:11:00.455 --> 03:11:04.458]  Where do you think this is going, and what are the controllers behind the scenes doing, and how do you respond to them?
[03:11:05.436 --> 03:11:08.618]  Well, you know, I think it's all about controlling speech.
[03:11:08.618 --> 03:11:11.579]  I mean, ultimately, that's what's going on here.
[03:11:11.579 --> 03:11:20.104]  And even the most repugnant speech, I think, is entitled to an airing because it's really simple in the 21st century to change channels.
[03:11:20.104 --> 03:11:24.666]  You know, there's exceptions like yelling fire in a movie theater, which are obvious.
[03:11:25.246 --> 03:11:29.827]  But short of that, the right to not be offended is not a right.
[03:11:29.827 --> 03:11:31.548]  In fact, I would suggest the opposite.
[03:11:31.548 --> 03:11:43.271]  If you're going to live in a democratic republic like ours, where speech is allowed, then offending others is kind of going to go with the program because it's unavoidable.
[03:11:43.271 --> 03:11:47.132]  So how do we counter this incredible un-Americanism that's all you and Ron?
[03:11:47.132 --> 03:11:50.873]  How do we counter people saying, we control what you can say with their finger in our face?
[03:11:50.873 --> 03:11:52.473]  It's so dangerous.
[03:11:53.790 --> 03:12:14.516]  You know, when I look at it fundamentally, I mean, we're on such an edge because you really don't have a freedom of the press, which is the fundamental of the speech issue that we're talking about, because the alternative press is more reliable, quite frankly, and we see things way before it's advanced, if ever advanced, in the mainstream.
[03:12:14.516 --> 03:12:19.257]  And I think when you look at it, it's about controlling the general thought
[03:12:19.997 --> 03:12:26.181]  And all the media is being used to this.
[03:12:26.181 --> 03:12:38.127]  It's not just about silencing those that have something else to say, it's also using those that play the game even more so to manipulate the general public into this kind of herd
[03:12:38.727 --> 03:12:46.856]  And so what do we do, just call out the whole elephant in the room and point out that that's the endgame and don't even debate each little point they make to shut us up?
[03:12:46.856 --> 03:12:51.300]  Transcend that and expose the whole system of what their endgame is.
[03:12:51.300 --> 03:13:01.071]  I think that's important, but I also think at some level, and this is where listeners can come into the game, because the best free speech lawsuit that could get to the Supreme Court
[03:13:01.836 --> 03:13:02.236]  Yes, we are.
[03:13:18.862 --> 03:13:19.442]  We're good to go.
[03:13:45.073 --> 03:13:55.417]  It has to do with choice, it has to do with interaction with each other, the dynamic of working against each other a bit in order to refine what we're about.
[03:13:55.417 --> 03:13:57.117]  And we can do that respectfully.
[03:13:57.117 --> 03:13:58.438]  And Doc, you're totally right.
[03:13:58.438 --> 03:13:59.738]  I'm going to let you get on to what you're doing.
[03:13:59.738 --> 03:14:07.380]  I apologize for taking some of the time, but I want to put up this map for a second of the Associated Press at the very top of this pyramid.
[03:14:07.380 --> 03:14:09.441]  This is something that the left has put out a few years ago.
[03:14:09.441 --> 03:14:11.962]  Look, InfoWars is the most unreliable.
[03:14:12.602 --> 03:14:13.383]  Yeah, you know, all of this.
[03:14:13.383 --> 03:14:16.746]  Suggesting that the modern media is reliable about anything is laughable.
[03:14:29.441 --> 03:14:54.131]  It is not even responsible as a media outlet because freedom of the press fundamentally has been altered in terms of its depth of meaning and we've lost that depth of meaning in the cartoon news of what we see on CNN and the big networks because what they've done is reduced the news to an editorial profiling of everything to herd people.
[03:14:54.751 --> 03:14:57.635]  News and the fundamentals of freedom of the press.
[03:14:57.635 --> 03:14:59.678]  Why was it so important?
[03:14:59.678 --> 03:15:05.847]  Why was it in the first ten, you know, within our framework?
[03:15:06.932 --> 03:15:11.695]  Within our framework constitutionally, why was the press so important?
[03:15:11.695 --> 03:15:19.799]  It's because an informed electorate, that's you, me, everyone, that forms the basis of this democratic republic.
[03:15:19.799 --> 03:15:23.101]  Individual sovereignty, individual people.
[03:15:23.101 --> 03:15:26.203]  And from that springs the authority of government.
[03:15:27.735 --> 03:15:29.556]  Not in some other obscure way.
[03:15:29.556 --> 03:15:38.120]  And the reason that we have a republic and elected representatives is to avoid exactly what we see the left doing right now.
[03:15:38.120 --> 03:15:39.521]  Mob rule.
[03:15:39.521 --> 03:15:41.702]  Mob rule doesn't work.
[03:15:41.702 --> 03:15:43.023]  It's a failure.
[03:15:43.023 --> 03:15:46.984]  It's a failure within the republic.
[03:15:46.984 --> 03:15:51.206]  It's only required if it fails, if the democracy fails.
[03:15:51.206 --> 03:15:52.687]  And it's not yet failed.
[03:15:53.539 --> 03:15:55.200]  We still have free elections.
[03:15:55.200 --> 03:15:57.862]  We still have a process.
[03:15:57.862 --> 03:16:00.944]  But we need to do some things to protect it right now.
[03:16:00.944 --> 03:16:04.446]  We should never have an electronic voting system.
[03:16:04.446 --> 03:16:06.127]  You know, I want to say this real loud.
[03:16:06.127 --> 03:16:09.048]  Some things should never be put electronic.
[03:16:09.048 --> 03:16:12.190]  The fundamentals of elections should be paper ballots.
[03:16:12.190 --> 03:16:14.732]  The fundamentals of free speech, we should be allowed.
[03:16:15.307 --> 03:16:27.196]  to say what we believe in freely and access the internet and all of the modern platforms and anyone who believes they have the authority to regulate speech is dead wrong.
[03:16:27.196 --> 03:16:28.898]  I don't care who they are.
[03:16:28.898 --> 03:16:31.860]  I don't care who they are.
[03:16:31.860 --> 03:16:42.088]  If they want to be the gatekeepers of speech, they're on the slippery slope to hell because speech cannot be regulated in this way.
[03:16:42.088 --> 03:16:43.809]  This is fundamentally the trap
[03:16:45.123 --> 03:16:50.178]  First, control the media by allowing it to all consolidate, and that's what's happened.
[03:16:50.178 --> 03:16:51.542]  We ought to break it up again.
[03:16:52.284 --> 03:17:01.389]  We gotta break it all up again, but wanna look at it this time when you break up these big networks, usually the people that own them even make more money and have even more power.
[03:17:01.389 --> 03:17:20.580]  So you need to look at how this happens to disassemble what has blocked this republic's free speech, because that violation, that human rights violation in every jurisdiction of the country, file a human rights complaint with the Human Rights Commission in your jurisdiction and challenge the silence of our speech.
[03:17:21.946 --> 03:17:23.109]  This is Dr. Nick Peggott.
[03:17:23.109 --> 03:17:27.740]  We'll be right back after these vital messages.
[03:17:32.640 --> 03:17:38.662]  We may have just broken not just the biggest story in InfoWars history, but one of the biggest stories, period.
[03:17:38.662 --> 03:17:52.128]  The state of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH have created a system where anyone that has a sore throat or a runny nose or who has been in contact with someone with COVID-19
[03:17:53.008 --> 03:17:58.392]  ...is then added into the database as having a case and is counted as a case of COVID-19.
[03:17:58.392 --> 03:18:00.253]  It's in the NIH documents.
[03:18:00.253 --> 03:18:01.113]  It's at the state level.
[03:18:01.113 --> 03:18:02.154]  We confirmed it in Texas.
[03:18:02.154 --> 03:18:04.075]  We're now confirming it's in other states.
[03:18:04.075 --> 03:18:12.300]  This is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people that die of gunshot wounds and stuff in the COVID column and the false positive test.
[03:18:12.300 --> 03:18:13.000]  That's all huge.
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.082]  This is beyond that.
[03:18:15.082 --> 03:18:17.143]  Mega criminal activity.
[03:18:22.806 --> 03:18:35.072]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[03:18:35.072 --> 03:18:41.235]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[03:18:41.235 --> 03:18:42.696]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[03:18:42.916 --> 03:18:45.617]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[03:18:45.617 --> 03:18:49.098]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[03:18:49.098 --> 03:18:58.361]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[03:18:58.361 --> 03:18:59.201]  Let me tell you something, man.
[03:18:59.361 --> 03:19:06.205]  I had an internal digestive problem, and I suffered with it for about five or six years, and the doctors, they tried every test.
[03:19:06.205 --> 03:19:07.706]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[03:19:07.706 --> 03:19:11.688]  And then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[03:19:11.688 --> 03:19:13.869]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[03:19:13.869 --> 03:19:16.891]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals, because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[03:19:16.891 --> 03:19:18.772]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[03:19:18.772 --> 03:19:19.292]  I got it.
[03:19:19.292 --> 03:19:20.533]  I hid it from the nurses.
[03:19:20.533 --> 03:19:21.574]  I started taking it.
[03:19:21.574 --> 03:19:23.615]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[03:19:23.615 --> 03:19:24.555]  It saved my life.
[03:19:24.555 --> 03:19:27.277]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[03:19:27.796 --> 03:19:38.131]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[03:19:38.131 --> 03:19:42.838]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[03:19:43.519 --> 03:19:51.882]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[03:19:51.882 --> 03:20:11.769]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[03:20:12.409 --> 03:20:33.312]  Destinies ladies and gentlemen there is a war on reality a war on civilization a war on our health a war on our economy But being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it so take action or be slaves You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[03:20:43.439 --> 03:20:49.903]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:49.903 --> 03:20:57.208]  And now, your host, Nick Vagic.
[03:20:57.208 --> 03:20:58.249]  And welcome back.
[03:20:58.249 --> 03:21:03.413]  It's good to be here this Friday, just before noon in my part of the world, in Anchorage, Alaska, and I'm
[03:21:04.717 --> 03:21:20.198]  Yeah, thinking about all this, what's going on, and I go back to some of my really early thoughts as I looked at the world, you know, back in the 1970s, in my teens, in my early teens, I had this concept that
[03:21:20.718 --> 03:21:29.804]  The big three things that would change the world, and I was reading a lot back then, was going to be transportation, communications, and information system.
[03:21:29.804 --> 03:21:35.468]  I said this from the time I was about 16 on, and then we saw what happened.
[03:21:35.468 --> 03:21:39.131]  You know, that was before FedEx and UPS had really taken off.
[03:21:39.691 --> 03:21:42.972]  That was before, in terms of transportation.
[03:21:42.972 --> 03:21:45.173]  And then think about airline costs.
[03:21:45.173 --> 03:21:53.376]  Back in the 70s, it was just as expensive in dollars to fly from here to Seattle as it is today.
[03:21:53.376 --> 03:21:55.937]  The actual costs continued to drop.
[03:21:55.937 --> 03:22:00.398]  In other words, the ability to move around the planet got cheaper and cheaper and cheaper up to a point.
[03:22:00.398 --> 03:22:01.699]  That may change.
[03:22:01.699 --> 03:22:06.380]  That's one of the side effects, unanticipated consequences of airline failure.
[03:22:06.380 --> 03:22:07.681]  We might see the price go up.
[03:22:08.297 --> 03:22:10.078]  But for now, think about this.
[03:22:10.078 --> 03:22:13.581]  So, transportation changed, fast freight changed everything.
[03:22:13.581 --> 03:22:18.305]  It brought about the possibility of the Amazons and everything else connected to fast freight.
[03:22:18.305 --> 03:22:27.331]  In fact, if you want to look at abuse of fast freight, look at Amazon, look at every mail truck delivering freight around the country, and they ought to just not call it not the U.S.
[03:22:27.331 --> 03:22:28.372]  Mail anymore, the U.S.
[03:22:28.372 --> 03:22:29.373]  Postal Service.
[03:22:29.373 --> 03:22:35.798]  They ought to call it Amazon subsidized freight because every box loses money and we all pay for it.
[03:22:36.198 --> 03:22:42.782]  And these guys get off and their stock goes up and we subsidize the Postal Service, which is now the Amazon Delivery Service.
[03:22:42.782 --> 03:22:54.228]  Maybe, maybe, they're suggesting that we ought to be out of the package business at the post office, call it a failure, maybe reorganize the post office because transportation's changed.
[03:22:54.228 --> 03:22:59.552]  It was one of my early teenage predictions, you know, and now I'm in my 60s.
[03:22:59.552 --> 03:23:03.374]  Okay, and we need to revamp the slow-moving
[03:23:04.364 --> 03:23:09.166]  Barge of government to catch up with the rest of the world in terms of what the U.S.
[03:23:09.166 --> 03:23:09.767]  mail is about.
[03:23:09.767 --> 03:23:16.710]  Remember, before the Pony Express, it took a letter, maybe a year, to get somewhere, if it ever got there.
[03:23:16.710 --> 03:23:19.892]  And then you got the Pony Express, and that took quite a while.
[03:23:19.892 --> 03:23:23.534]  And that was a big improvement, but nobody ever got what we have today.
[03:23:23.534 --> 03:23:26.075]  And the question of utilizing the mail in the same way.
[03:23:26.075 --> 03:23:29.937]  So transportation against all of the existing structures can be reanalyzed.
[03:23:30.521 --> 03:23:31.702]  Communication.
[03:23:31.702 --> 03:23:33.783]  The next one from my teen years.
[03:23:33.783 --> 03:23:34.724]  Think about it.
[03:23:34.724 --> 03:23:36.666]  The communications of the world.
[03:23:36.666 --> 03:23:47.233]  What we're doing right now, I'm live from Alaska broadcasting around the world, being channeled through Austin, so the graphics and all the things can be added in.
[03:23:47.233 --> 03:23:49.655]  And we have a conversation around the world.
[03:23:49.655 --> 03:23:50.756]  Communications.
[03:23:50.756 --> 03:23:55.860]  I don't have to tell everyone now how fundamentally that has changed.
[03:23:55.860 --> 03:23:58.822]  When you look at information systems,
[03:23:59.505 --> 03:24:01.245]  We didn't have personal computers.
[03:24:01.245 --> 03:24:02.666]  We didn't have any of it.
[03:24:02.666 --> 03:24:08.187]  We had typewriters, which people can't even figure out how to use today because they don't make sense, right?
[03:24:08.187 --> 03:24:09.767]  There's no monitor.
[03:24:09.767 --> 03:24:12.348]  You got to put paper and roll this thing around.
[03:24:12.348 --> 03:24:16.548]  So the thing, the things have changed in those three areas.
[03:24:16.548 --> 03:24:19.389]  Now coming off of that, what were the next things?
[03:24:19.389 --> 03:24:20.629]  You know, this is my teens.
[03:24:20.629 --> 03:24:22.270]  Okay, what do I see now?
[03:24:22.270 --> 03:24:29.351]  All these years later, what I see is the sophistication of this on such a level.
[03:24:30.609 --> 03:24:52.544]  The empowering effect that could have happened, that should happen, that still can happen, has been gutted by people being reduced continuously to less and less and less of our potential by being told how bad we are, how horrible we are, how empty we are, how racist we are, how whatever we are, you know?
[03:24:52.544 --> 03:24:54.846]  And here's the thing I would say about all of it.
[03:24:55.293 --> 03:25:12.040]  When external voices are telling you what you are, you might want to not listen so carefully and you might want to turn the other direction and go internally and decide what you are and who you are and how you're going to project in the world, not allowing the world to tell you.
[03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:19.243]  Now, when you talk about the Anti-Defamation League, where Alex kind of left off and asked me, you know, what do I think?
[03:25:19.243 --> 03:25:21.424]  I don't like people telling me how to think.
[03:25:22.313 --> 03:25:28.719]  Okay, I don't care who they are or what good works they represent to themselves in the world.
[03:25:28.719 --> 03:25:31.421]  I'm interested in what people have to say.
[03:25:31.421 --> 03:25:38.608]  I'm very interested because I don't believe people generally come to where they're at arbitrarily.
[03:25:38.608 --> 03:25:43.452]  You know, we come by rational reason, most of us anyway.
[03:25:43.452 --> 03:25:47.436]  So when someone disagrees with me, my interest is to hear why.
[03:25:47.436 --> 03:25:48.437]  I want to know the root.
[03:25:49.131 --> 03:25:59.155]  Of what information they have that I might be missing because that's the essence of respect and communication and that's the essence of respecting the human dignity of another.
[03:25:59.155 --> 03:26:06.577]  And that's also being removed because the interfaces are becoming less human, more removed, more separated.
[03:26:06.577 --> 03:26:08.278]  And this is fundamentally wrong.
[03:26:08.278 --> 03:26:10.959]  This leads us down a path of destruction.
[03:26:10.959 --> 03:26:14.940]  These are blind leading the blind and they both fall into ditches eventually.
[03:26:15.638 --> 03:26:26.927]  This is where we're headed if we follow a path that denies the individual internal sovereignty of the human being as we project into the world.
[03:26:26.927 --> 03:26:31.130]  And this is what's, I believe, the most important message of all these days.
[03:26:31.130 --> 03:26:40.938]  Because as we look at the window dressing of human affairs, the way we behave, most of what we see that's dysfunctional is because of this.
[03:26:40.938 --> 03:26:44.701]  This lack of mutual respect for one another.
[03:26:45.416 --> 03:26:46.416]  Fundamentally.
[03:26:46.416 --> 03:26:50.478]  And we see it played out in all kinds of divisive games.
[03:26:50.478 --> 03:26:59.601]  And when you see the level of divisiveness being generated on the basis of the color of your skin, come on!
[03:26:59.601 --> 03:27:05.783]  In the 21st century, in the United States, we're having this discussion again on this level.
[03:27:05.783 --> 03:27:12.665]  I want everyone to just slow down a bit, if you would, and recognize something fundamental.
[03:27:13.619 --> 03:27:19.703]  If you do believe this, Jewish, Muslims, Christians, we're creating the image of a creator.
[03:27:19.703 --> 03:27:31.011]  I've said it every broadcast the last six I've been on because this has to be remembered or everything else we can forget because it doesn't matter anymore.
[03:27:31.011 --> 03:27:33.853]  Then we're living in the flesh, we might as well just wallow in it.
[03:27:34.446 --> 03:27:35.807]  And I'm not going there.
[03:27:35.807 --> 03:27:43.371]  I remain a pathological optimist through all of it, because this is indeed a short stop between interviews.
[03:27:43.371 --> 03:27:46.933]  You might be here 80, 100 years if you're lucky.
[03:27:46.933 --> 03:27:52.036]  And that last second, I've said it before, is worth a million dollars to every breathing soul.
[03:27:52.036 --> 03:27:55.818]  But on the other side of your last breath is eternity.
[03:27:56.815 --> 03:27:58.875]  Where time is worthless.
[03:27:58.875 --> 03:28:05.057]  I want to talk about that because I hear a lot, you know, in the context of discussion about sacrifice and giving up.
[03:28:05.057 --> 03:28:12.018]  And the one verse that comes up often is this idea of, you know, to give up oneself is like the ultimate thing.
[03:28:12.018 --> 03:28:16.459]  To give up your life for another is the ultimate thing.
[03:28:16.459 --> 03:28:23.441]  But I want to just break that down a little bit because most people start thinking, oh, that means if I take a bullet, no, no, no.
[03:28:25.333 --> 03:28:26.694]  The Creator wants to wipe you out.
[03:28:26.694 --> 03:28:30.437]  He can give you lead poisoning without concentrated form.
[03:28:30.437 --> 03:28:31.678]  Okay, I'm a bullet.
[03:28:31.678 --> 03:28:46.811]  But here's the point I'm making is when you're looking at laying down one's life for your friends, and Christ called his disciples his friends, not his subjects or his servants, but his friends.
[03:28:46.811 --> 03:28:47.892]  Okay?
[03:28:47.892 --> 03:28:49.354]  Because what does that mean?
[03:28:49.354 --> 03:28:53.117]  That means you give up this finite thing you have in the earth.
[03:28:53.908 --> 03:28:54.829]  Call time.
[03:28:54.829 --> 03:28:57.770]  Remember that last second worth a million dollars to all of us?
[03:28:57.770 --> 03:29:03.693]  But the span of our time is the one thing we don't get more of, we don't get less of, we get the appointed amount.
[03:29:03.693 --> 03:29:04.774]  See?
[03:29:04.774 --> 03:29:06.255]  And that's it.
[03:29:06.255 --> 03:29:14.119]  So if you give your time to another, that's what this verse is talking about.
[03:29:14.119 --> 03:29:17.661]  That sacrifice of giving the unreplaceable thing
[03:29:18.251 --> 03:29:25.433]  That all of us hold the most valuable thing in this world, the time we have here.
[03:29:25.433 --> 03:29:29.095]  That's the greatest gift of all, you see.
[03:29:29.095 --> 03:29:32.596]  This is what we have to give each other.
[03:29:32.596 --> 03:29:42.499]  And effort, time, trying, this is all I've been saying the last six weeks in all different ways trying to get the message across that trying is the act of faith.
[03:29:43.306 --> 03:29:50.928]  Not condemning ourselves so harshly because that's not a good idea to condemn the divine creation that we are.
[03:29:50.928 --> 03:30:00.270]  And the same as we reflect on another person outside of ourself and our connectedness to them through the universal that connects us all.
[03:30:00.270 --> 03:30:06.532]  And so when I think about what we're giving each other here on this Friday afternoon is our time.
[03:30:07.190 --> 03:30:08.711]  To change the world together.
[03:30:08.711 --> 03:30:13.473]  To alter how this thing goes by recognizing we all have a role to play.
[03:30:13.473 --> 03:30:15.113]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:30:15.113 --> 03:30:18.815]  Check out EarthPulse.com and listen now for these very important messages.
[03:30:18.815 --> 03:30:26.958]  We'll be right back.
[03:30:26.958 --> 03:30:33.201]  I must end this special, our extended July 4th special, by Monday the 12th.
[03:30:33.201 --> 03:30:35.062]  That is our drop dead date
[03:30:35.808 --> 03:30:44.595]  It absolutely has to happen because a lot of these products that have been sold out, we can only get limited supplies of them because the supply chain is breaking down.
[03:30:44.595 --> 03:30:49.779]  Winter Sun with vitamin D3 and vitamin K, sold out for months, back in stock, 50% off.
[03:30:49.779 --> 03:30:55.083]  Ultra 12, high quality B12, take another tongue, sold out for months, back in stock, 50% off.
[03:30:55.083 --> 03:31:03.509]  Bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula, super strong turmeric concentration, sold out for months, back in stock, limited amount, 50% off, double Patriot points,
[03:31:03.909 --> 03:31:04.690]  Free shipping.
[03:31:04.690 --> 03:31:10.395]  It's the same thing with Vitamin Refusion, Survival Shield X3, and so much more.
[03:31:10.395 --> 03:31:12.157]  And it funds the information war.
[03:31:12.157 --> 03:31:14.899]  The globalists want you sick and weak and dumbed down.
[03:31:14.899 --> 03:31:17.662]  They don't want you to know what God has given us all through Mother Nature.
[03:31:17.662 --> 03:31:19.043]  These products are powerful.
[03:31:19.043 --> 03:31:21.125]  Many of you have tried them and reordered them and loved them.
[03:31:21.125 --> 03:31:21.966]  Many of you haven't.
[03:31:21.966 --> 03:31:24.688]  The sale ends in just a few days, so take action now and get free shipping.
[03:31:27.290 --> 03:31:29.891]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[03:31:29.891 --> 03:31:42.677]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[03:31:43.217 --> 03:31:43.717]  I think so.
[03:32:03.251 --> 03:32:07.233]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[03:32:07.233 --> 03:32:12.475]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[03:32:12.475 --> 03:32:20.318]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[03:32:20.318 --> 03:32:24.160]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[03:32:24.160 --> 03:32:26.201]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[03:32:28.757 --> 03:32:33.459]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[03:33:28.712 --> 03:33:34.275]  I am cutting this ad on Friday, and by Monday afternoon, we have to end this special.
[03:33:34.275 --> 03:33:42.841]  Because even though a lot of these items have been sold out and just came back in, we only ordered a limited amount of things like bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula.
[03:33:42.841 --> 03:33:53.127]  Because quite frankly, the supply chain has broken down with COVID-19, and a lot of products we've been unable to even get back in stock because the companies we get them from are partially shut down.
[03:33:53.507 --> 03:33:54.748]  This is totally crazy.
[03:33:54.748 --> 03:34:05.199]  So you've got just a few days left to take advantage of the July 4th Mega Sale with storewide free shipping, double Patriot Points, and up to 60% off on high quality products.
[03:34:05.199 --> 03:34:07.021]  DNA Force Plus, 50% off.
[03:34:07.021 --> 03:34:08.483]  Winner's sum of vitamin D3 and vitamin K.
[03:34:08.803 --> 03:34:10.144]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:34:46.662 --> 03:34:53.872]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagic.
[03:34:53.872 --> 03:34:56.635]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:59.961 --> 03:35:11.964]  And welcome back, this is Nick Begich, and I want to remind people to check out our website at earthpulse.com, e-a-r-t-h-p-u-l-s-e, earthpulse.com, and get on our free mailing list.
[03:35:11.964 --> 03:35:14.444]  It's not shared, but it'll get you our newsletter.
[03:35:14.444 --> 03:35:21.546]  We're going to kick one out here in the next few days, and get on that list at earthpulse.com and get a free newsletter from us.
[03:35:21.546 --> 03:35:23.166]  We'll try and do that a little more frequently.
[03:35:23.166 --> 03:35:27.607]  You know, just before the break, we were talking a little bit about
[03:35:29.170 --> 03:35:37.355]  Really, the way in which all this is kind of shifting us around as humans, because we were kind of kicked around a lot.
[03:35:37.355 --> 03:35:42.918]  And then when you look about about the world and you say, now, what is actually happening?
[03:35:42.918 --> 03:35:44.599]  They're slowing down the ability to move.
[03:35:44.599 --> 03:35:51.803]  They're going to be able to manage where you go or at least track it with 100 percent accuracy.
[03:35:51.803 --> 03:35:52.964]  That's where they're headed.
[03:35:52.964 --> 03:35:56.746]  They want to monitor who you see, who you interact with, who you pass in the hallway.
[03:35:58.392 --> 03:36:06.796]  This level of transparency is dangerous when it's manipulated by government, which is essentially what we're talking about here.
[03:36:06.796 --> 03:36:09.797]  And to use health as a gateway.
[03:36:09.797 --> 03:36:15.440]  And then you kind of look at, well, you know, when things happen, people take advantage of it.
[03:36:15.440 --> 03:36:19.401]  Who are our real adversaries in the world?
[03:36:19.401 --> 03:36:21.462]  You know, is Russia our adversary?
[03:36:21.462 --> 03:36:22.583]  China?
[03:36:22.583 --> 03:36:23.183]  Someone else?
[03:36:23.183 --> 03:36:25.964]  You know, stop and think about for a moment,
[03:36:26.821 --> 03:36:29.884]  And I don't believe Russia is our adversary.
[03:36:29.884 --> 03:36:38.812]  I think they're exercising within their old spheres of influence, just like we do in other parts of the world.
[03:36:38.812 --> 03:36:43.356]  I don't see their active aggression as much as people want to talk about.
[03:36:43.356 --> 03:36:45.378]  China, on the other hand, I see a whole different
[03:36:45.818 --> 03:36:50.020]  Matrix there in terms of long-term what's happening.
[03:36:50.020 --> 03:36:51.781]  Russia is an evolving democracy.
[03:36:51.781 --> 03:36:53.041]  They're immature right now.
[03:36:53.041 --> 03:36:54.002]  They're going to change.
[03:36:54.002 --> 03:36:59.925]  They're going to continue to evolve as the next generation comes in and the following generation comes in.
[03:36:59.925 --> 03:37:02.025]  China is not a democracy.
[03:37:02.025 --> 03:37:02.986]  It never was.
[03:37:02.986 --> 03:37:07.288]  They just use capitalism as a way to build the productive capacity.
[03:37:07.908 --> 03:37:11.892]  To assert themselves in the world, more powerfully in the world.
[03:37:11.892 --> 03:37:14.755]  They only had an intermission for a couple hundred years.
[03:37:14.755 --> 03:37:18.718]  Prior to that, they were the most powerful in the world, and people forget this.
[03:37:18.718 --> 03:37:25.264]  Study Chinese history and you get a bigger picture of the long-term look at what happens here.
[03:37:25.264 --> 03:37:33.532]  But as individuals within China, Russia, or anywhere else around the world, we're still dealing with fundamentally human beings.
[03:37:34.053 --> 03:37:39.877]  Now, the corruption that occurs that allows people to move to the top happens throughout the world.
[03:37:39.877 --> 03:37:45.120]  It's not unique to China or Russia or the U.S.
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:46.521]  or other places.
[03:37:46.521 --> 03:37:49.263]  In fact, it is what happens.
[03:37:49.263 --> 03:37:56.828]  You know, I mean, remember Cambridge Analytica affected 60 countries' national elections around the world.
[03:37:56.828 --> 03:38:00.130]  People with influence, money and power like to keep it.
[03:38:00.908 --> 03:38:05.169]  And like to get more and don't like voices that challenge that.
[03:38:05.169 --> 03:38:12.271]  And this is what is the big game, the larger game played out on a global chess board.
[03:38:12.271 --> 03:38:20.453]  And humans, all of us are looked at as insignificant by those that live in the world, in the flesh.
[03:38:20.453 --> 03:38:26.594]  When you realize that that's not the case, that that's, that is not really how it rolls.
[03:38:26.594 --> 03:38:28.855]  You begin to behave differently and things come out.
[03:38:29.858 --> 03:38:33.621]  Now there's a huge challenge, and here's what I know about the world.
[03:38:33.621 --> 03:38:38.746]  It's a dualistic system that we live in, in the earth.
[03:38:38.746 --> 03:38:50.115]  Not that it is balanced, good and evil, in the sense of overarching this physical reality as something much greater, where there is not that.
[03:38:50.115 --> 03:38:51.997]  But within this world, there is that.
[03:38:51.997 --> 03:38:56.260]  What I know is there's always an equal and proportionate reaction to what we see today.
[03:38:56.260 --> 03:38:57.201]  So what is that?
[03:38:58.248 --> 03:38:59.728]  reaction that we see.
[03:38:59.728 --> 03:39:03.909]  It's the one I think I've been talking about the last six weeks.
[03:39:03.909 --> 03:39:14.172]  Because the next revolution is internal, where our power is realized again and then is projected extra.
[03:39:14.172 --> 03:39:16.852]  This is what globalists fear the most.
[03:39:16.852 --> 03:39:22.714]  Empowered living souls occupying bodies and engaging the world differently.
[03:39:22.714 --> 03:39:25.234]  This is where the power is.
[03:39:25.234 --> 03:39:27.855]  And see it's not going to be some guy leading a parade.
[03:39:29.931 --> 03:39:31.412]  That's the joke of it all.
[03:39:31.412 --> 03:39:36.674]  That's where the universe, where God sends the different messengers.
[03:39:36.674 --> 03:39:44.957]  They're all over, and they're driving taxis, and they're banging nails, and they're doing all the things that humans do.
[03:39:44.957 --> 03:39:51.100]  As we remember who we are and begin to project in the world, this is going to change the world, you see.
[03:39:52.069 --> 03:39:58.611]  It's this projection and the things we do as individuals within the laws and order that we still have.
[03:39:58.611 --> 03:40:03.293]  And so we need to challenge as far up the court system as we can.
[03:40:03.293 --> 03:40:10.315]  We need to slow this legislatively and we need to recognize that the national political parties have failed.
[03:40:10.315 --> 03:40:11.515]  Okay.
[03:40:11.515 --> 03:40:12.335]  Let me say that again.
[03:40:12.335 --> 03:40:16.117]  The national political parties have failed.
[03:40:16.117 --> 03:40:17.597]  They didn't elect Trump.
[03:40:17.597 --> 03:40:19.298]  You did.
[03:40:19.298 --> 03:40:19.738]  We did.
[03:40:19.738 --> 03:40:20.358]  Okay.
[03:40:21.129 --> 03:40:24.751]  They had 16 other players they wanted to elect that weren't Donald Trump.
[03:40:24.751 --> 03:40:26.731]  Okay?
[03:40:26.731 --> 03:40:31.173]  The national political parties are corrupted to the core.
[03:40:31.173 --> 03:40:33.214]  You see, this is the truth of it.
[03:40:33.214 --> 03:40:35.315]  At the state levels, less corruption.
[03:40:35.315 --> 03:40:37.596]  At the local level, even less.
[03:40:37.596 --> 03:40:43.618]  But, because you meet too many people at the local level, it'll challenge the corruption at some point or another.
[03:40:43.618 --> 03:40:49.661]  But as things evolve to the top, this is why the Epstein story, the stuff that's not yet come out,
[03:40:50.507 --> 03:40:58.290]  All of these horror shows to show where these national and international leaders truly are is about to break if this really comes out.
[03:40:58.290 --> 03:41:02.491]  If it doesn't, then we're all betrayed by this system and everyone in it.
[03:41:02.491 --> 03:41:02.771]  Okay?
[03:41:02.771 --> 03:41:07.613]  Because if it doesn't come out, they say they have these tapes, they have this information.
[03:41:07.613 --> 03:41:13.895]  Don't just throw a couple token guys and then blackmail the rest like we generally do with our CIA and FBI.
[03:41:14.784 --> 03:41:16.545]  Let's not do that this time.
[03:41:16.545 --> 03:41:32.137]  Let's pull their pants down, because they already did, and let's expose them for who they are, all of them, and bring them down, and bring them low, where they belong, accountable for who they are and what they've done.
[03:41:32.137 --> 03:41:33.438]  And that's it.
[03:41:33.438 --> 03:41:35.140]  It's as simple as that.
[03:41:35.140 --> 03:41:40.524]  Not burn them at the stake, but, hey, the manipulations need to end.
[03:41:40.524 --> 03:41:43.206]  Free speech needs to win.
[03:41:44.284 --> 03:41:47.987]  Justice needs to happen, and it doesn't right now.
[03:41:47.987 --> 03:41:51.730]  Think about the court cases that all of you are familiar with.
[03:41:51.730 --> 03:41:52.991]  You know?
[03:41:52.991 --> 03:41:54.692]  And how much did they cost?
[03:41:54.692 --> 03:41:55.813]  Did you get justice?
[03:41:55.813 --> 03:41:57.154]  Did anybody get justice?
[03:41:57.154 --> 03:42:06.501]  Not unless you were a millionaire and gave up everything you have, everything you own, for a measure of justice to the court system that exists today.
[03:42:06.501 --> 03:42:11.784]  To have free speech protected, you have to spend millions and millions of dollars to get to that U.S.
[03:42:11.784 --> 03:42:12.425]  Supreme Court.
[03:42:13.271 --> 03:42:15.172]  Is that free speech?
[03:42:15.172 --> 03:42:16.833]  Is that justice?
[03:42:16.833 --> 03:42:18.674]  You want to talk about socialized medicine?
[03:42:18.674 --> 03:42:22.596]  How about socialized lawyers so we all have equal footing in the courts?
[03:42:22.596 --> 03:42:25.977]  Because you sure as heck don't have it now, you know?
[03:42:25.977 --> 03:42:33.701]  I mean, I'm just kidding on that note, but actually justice is enshrined in the Constitution and you don't get it.
[03:42:33.701 --> 03:42:35.662]  The courts are not just unless you're rich.
[03:42:36.553 --> 03:42:43.078]  Let me say it again, if you're rich, and that isn't called justice, that's called manipulation there too, unfortunately.
[03:42:43.078 --> 03:42:45.380]  Because the guys with the money can win.
[03:42:45.380 --> 03:42:52.405]  This is, you know, and I'm not saying that making money is bad, opposite of that.
[03:42:52.405 --> 03:42:54.507]  I believe in capitalism as a system.
[03:42:54.507 --> 03:42:55.648]  What I don't believe in,
[03:42:56.585 --> 03:43:01.367]  Is using the political system as a branch of capitalism, because it's not.
[03:43:01.367 --> 03:43:07.649]  That's why China, which is communist, has an economic system called capitalism, and so do we.
[03:43:07.649 --> 03:43:10.670]  But we have a different political system.
[03:43:10.670 --> 03:43:23.475]  And we need to recognize that the political system in America is rooted in individual sovereignty and representative government to protect us from ourselves, really, on one level, mob rule.
[03:43:24.346 --> 03:43:30.831]  And at the same time, to give us a process by which we can throw out those that we elect.
[03:43:30.831 --> 03:43:32.912]  But we need to protect that electoral process.
[03:43:32.912 --> 03:43:34.574]  That's why paper ballots.
[03:43:34.574 --> 03:43:35.775]  So what can you do?
[03:43:35.775 --> 03:43:37.356]  You can petition your government.
[03:43:37.356 --> 03:43:40.018]  You can start to push on the people that understand this.
[03:43:40.018 --> 03:43:41.339]  You can talk more about it.
[03:43:41.339 --> 03:43:47.603]  In my state, if you have enough money, you can launch petition drives and do some things here.
[03:43:47.603 --> 03:43:48.044]  But again,
[03:43:48.903 --> 03:43:58.030]  Take the steps you know you can take confidently to get your republic back, to get this democratic republic back.
[03:43:58.030 --> 03:44:01.053]  Participate in the discourse where you can.
[03:44:01.053 --> 03:44:07.118]  And I realize that it's a scary world right now because there's a lot of crazy people doing crazy things.
[03:44:07.118 --> 03:44:09.860]  But don't join them in the craziness.
[03:44:09.860 --> 03:44:17.326]  Stand out as the leaders that we are, remembering who we are and valuing
[03:44:18.090 --> 03:44:30.858]  Every living soul that we meet, not letting them get by with speech we don't agree with, but being respectful in the disagreement, being respectful in the debate.
[03:44:30.858 --> 03:44:43.486]  And if it's clear you're not going to change anybody's mind, I won't say don't waste your time because time is not wasted, but then just show compassion, recognize your inability to agree and step back.
[03:44:44.161 --> 03:44:47.522]  There'll be other issues perhaps you can agree on with that soul.
[03:44:47.522 --> 03:44:48.643]  But that one isn't it.
[03:44:48.643 --> 03:44:49.883]  Whatever it is.
[03:44:49.883 --> 03:44:52.084]  So, you can't win every debate.
[03:44:52.084 --> 03:44:53.764]  You're not going to win every argument.
[03:44:53.764 --> 03:44:59.946]  But what you are going to win is every opportunity to love each other in a different way.
[03:44:59.946 --> 03:45:02.927]  A way that touches the soul even of your adversary.
[03:45:02.927 --> 03:45:09.870]  It makes it impossible for them to hate you when you look in the eye and see the God in them and they see the God in you.
[03:45:09.870 --> 03:45:12.111]  This is Dr. Nick Feggis this Friday afternoon.
[03:45:12.111 --> 03:45:12.971]  Thanks for being with me.
