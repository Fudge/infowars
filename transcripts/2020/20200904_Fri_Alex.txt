[00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:01.006]  Hey!
[00:00:01.127 --> 00:00:02.528]  Stop breaking my s**t!
[00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:03.850]  Leave my s**t!
[00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.851]  Woah, woah, woah!
[00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:04.951]  Hey!
[00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:05.531]  Hey!
[00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:05.732]  Stop!
[00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:06.332]  I'm stoned!
[00:00:06.392 --> 00:00:06.873]  I can't!
[00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:07.373]  Alright!
[00:00:07.453 --> 00:00:07.814]  Alright!
[00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:08.274]  Okay, look!
[00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:09.536]  I'm just playing!
[00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:10.217]  I'm just playing!
[00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:13.120]  What's up with this thing?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.400]  Why?
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.561]  I'm just playing!
[00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.784]  You're turning your head behind your back!
[00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.627]  You're turning your head behind your back!
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:30.543]  This is secret police, this is tyranny, and they've announced the Global Clinton Initiative runs this worldwide and is getting money from dozens of countries and hundreds of states.
[00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:37.685]  The Global Clinton Initiative is part of the money from Google that Governor Abbott gave them, hundreds of millions, to run contact tracing in Texas.
[00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:45.108]  They're already tracking your phones, they're already controlling you, it's the social credit score rollout, and they're getting the money for it.
[00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:48.737]  Former Australian Prime Minister slams health dictatorship.
[00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.279]  Yeah, it's a medical tyranny.
[00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.899]  That's what I call it.
[00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:56.505]  UK transport police manhandle pepper spray train passenger for not wearing mask.
[00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:58.107]  It's all about virtue signaling.
[00:00:58.127 --> 00:00:58.768]  They're being told.
[00:00:59.308 --> 00:01:03.532]  If it's a communist meeting, an Islamic meeting, you know Muslims are kidnapping little girls and sex slaving them.
[00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:04.694]  Don't you touch them!
[00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.250]  But if somebody isn't wearing a mask and is white, beat the hell out of them.
[00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.451]  It's about driving the indigenous population into submission.
[00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.723]  Who the f**k are you grabbing?
[00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:27.683]  Get off me!
[00:01:28.364 --> 00:01:29.344]  I've told you, no!
[00:01:29.744 --> 00:01:30.664]  Now get off me!
[00:01:31.064 --> 00:01:32.385]  Now get off me!
[00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:33.385]  Now you've been told!
[00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:34.205]  Get the f**k off!
[00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.446]  It's all because of Brexit, all because of Trump.
[00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:38.107]  And it's going to blow up in their face.
[00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:40.727]  He hasn't done nothing wrong!
[00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:43.228]  He hasn't done nothing wrong!
[00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:44.829]  He's done nothing wrong!
[00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:45.769]  Get off me!
[00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:46.949]  Medical conditions!
[00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:00.500]  I need to speak to you.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.501]  This is bad cops.
[00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.383]  This is what leftists is.
[00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.645]  You want to live in a police state, live under liberals.
[00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:11.310]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:16.217]  59 days out.
[00:02:17.518 --> 00:02:19.181]  It's Friday, September 4th.
[00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:24.147]  We're broadcasting from the heart of the Resistance, the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:29.013]  The enemy is in trouble, but they're launching every weapon system they've got.
[00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.990]  Tonight,
[00:02:56.784 --> 00:02:59.286]  It was a free-for-all and the police were letting it happen.
[00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:08.754]  Had I not acted, I am confident that my friend and I'm sure I would have been killed because I wasn't gonna stand there and let something happen.
[00:03:09.174 --> 00:03:13.978]  A protester linked to Saturday's shooting in Portland speaks to us about what happened that night.
[00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.660]  To be clear, he hasn't been arrested or charged.
[00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.504]  We didn't go looking for him and we have no information where he is now.
[00:03:21.044 --> 00:03:24.906]  He went to a freelance journalist, Donovan Farley, who brought it to us.
[00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:28.228]  We then sent a freelance filmmaker to tape the sit-down.
[00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:33.230]  Tess Owen has been covering extremism at Vice News, and she's here to help us get a handle on this.
[00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.852]  Tess, do we know anything about this guy, and why is he talking to us?
[00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:43.955]  His name is Michael Raynell, and so far, Portland police have been pretty tight-lipped about what actually happened on Saturday night.
[00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:48.978]  The victim's been described as a supporter of Patriot Prayer, which is a far-right group in the area.
[00:03:50.334 --> 00:04:04.599]  One night after the shooting, Ryanair's name began circulating on 4chan as a possible suspect, and then his name went into social media and right-wing blogs, and then local media, citing police sources, have since described him as a person of interest in the shooting.
[00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:12.661]  And conservative media also honed in on his own social media posts, where he's described himself as 100% Antifa.
[00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:17.123]  And Trump has shared that tweet, saying that the victim was murdered in Portland by Antifa.
[00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:19.675]  So you've been covering this story from the beginning.
[00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:21.896]  What have you found about what happened that night?
[00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:28.602]  So on August 29th, there was this pro-Trump caravan that started in a town about 10 miles southeast of Portland.
[00:04:29.162 --> 00:04:40.632]  Portland police knew about the caravan and had apparently been tasked with making sure that it stayed out of downtown Portland to avoid escalating tensions, which there have been running pretty high, more than 90 days of consecutive protests.
[00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:46.837]  And still some parts of the caravan peeled off and made their way into downtown Portland to confront protesters.
[00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:50.258]  And then the evening, or hours later, the shooting took place.
[00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:53.498]  So Tess, this didn't happen in a vacuum.
[00:04:54.118 --> 00:04:56.919]  Why were pro-Trump supporters there in a caravan?
[00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:00.959]  And why was someone protesting against police violence, bringing a gun?
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.281]  So, that is disgusting vice, posing like they're independent journalists that work over at the pro-pedophile network HBO.
[00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:12.882]  And of course, vice is pro-pedophile.
[00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:14.242]  That's back in the news today.
[00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:18.774]  They are there acting like this guy's a hero.
[00:05:18.814 --> 00:05:19.514]  He did nothing wrong.
[00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:25.235]  Well, he pulled a gun and tried to shoot the sheriff's deputies that were on a federal task force there, saying he got killed.
[00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:31.257]  And it turns out when they called his sister, she said that it's not bad news that he's dead.
[00:05:31.537 --> 00:05:33.177]  Oh, and he was never in the military.
[00:05:33.217 --> 00:05:34.138]  That was all a lie, too.
[00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:37.539]  Everything comes out of his mouth is a lie.
[00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.320]  Looking at him, he looks like a devil worshipping meth head.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.121]  And if you go to any Antifa event, they all look the same.
[00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:46.241]  Glow in the dark.
[00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.931]  Devil worshipping meth-head.
[00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:52.072]  Now, do we know he's a devil worshipping meth-head?
[00:05:54.274 --> 00:06:03.559]  No, he's just part of a devil worshipping meth-head organization, but I bet all the tea in China that if you get into his records and dig into that, you're going to find probably way more than that.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:15.926]  By the way, they have released more information on the first person shot in Kenosha, and even the New York Times admits witnesses said that a shot was fired in
[00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:31.513]  Kyle Rittenhouse's way and that the gentleman leading the attack against him kidnapped, sodomized, raped multiple boys as young as nine.
[00:06:33.507 --> 00:06:41.630]  Pito, allegedly shot by Kyle Rittenhouse, sodomized, molested multiple boys as young as nine years old.
[00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.512]  It is a pedophile army of Satanists.
[00:06:45.132 --> 00:06:47.853]  The other guy shot was wearing a bath-o-mat mask.
[00:06:49.294 --> 00:06:52.795]  Of course, he had a giant rap sheet as well, and so did the other thug.
[00:06:53.555 --> 00:06:59.078]  A group of glow-in-the-dark scum, and I can just tell you right now,
[00:07:00.091 --> 00:07:02.452]  Almost every one of them is a pedophile.
[00:07:02.732 --> 00:07:04.353]  This is an army of Satanists.
[00:07:05.193 --> 00:07:06.754]  They want to drain energy off children.
[00:07:07.914 --> 00:07:22.160]  The final countdown as we enter the homestretch into the disaster that will be the contested election of the century.
[00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:25.562]  They will then hold the economy hostage.
[00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:31.213]  They will then demand Trump step down or you'll never get your 401ks.
[00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:38.596]  And it'll be up to us to remove these criminal scumbags or be their slaves forever.
[00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:46.019]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday, September 4th, 2020 transmission.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:55.183]  We are going to be taking your calls throughout the broadcast today ahead of the War Room with Owen Schroyer at 3 p.m.
[00:07:56.664 --> 00:08:04.631]  And then, of course, you've got the special nighttime election countdown show we've been doing with Deonna Lorraine and the rest of the great crew.
[00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:09.055]  And I'll be part of that transmission tonight as well.
[00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:11.517]  Again, I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:13.258 --> 00:08:21.045]  I think the best thing for me to do is just read you the stacks of these headlines in this segment and then drill into these deeper after that.
[00:08:22.483 --> 00:08:26.947]  A man linked to killing at Portland protests says he acted in self-defense.
[00:08:27.848 --> 00:08:37.897]  So he confesses to Vice doing it, says he was protecting a person of color, even though the video, we now have close-up video of them running up saying, we've got a trumper, we've got a trumper, pull it, pull it out, get him.
[00:08:38.357 --> 00:08:41.200]  And the witnesses all said they saw him shoot him in the chest.
[00:08:42.661 --> 00:08:43.922]  But we know he's a big fat liar.
[00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:49.247]  Portland murder suspect dead after pulling gun on feds during arrest, admitted guilt,
[00:08:50.509 --> 00:09:07.738]  Hours earlier in Vice interview, despite outstanding charges and an unpaid fine, Portland killer Michael Raynell was set free by Judge Amy M. Baggio when arrested a month ago and now two men are dead.
[00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:12.561]  Antifa gunman shot dead by cops said he was
[00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:18.396]  Killing of Trump supporter felt like the start of a civil war.
[00:09:18.456 --> 00:09:24.258]  But you know, Nadler, one of the ranking Democrats, he says it doesn't exist.
[00:09:24.278 --> 00:09:26.499]  They just have marches with 10,000 people, Antifa.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.281]  They just burn down buildings all over the country and kill people.
[00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:31.021]  But it doesn't exist.
[00:09:32.522 --> 00:09:37.244]  Sister of Portland Antifa gunman reacts to his death after he was shot by the marshals.
[00:09:37.824 --> 00:09:41.446]  Says, quote, I wouldn't say at this point this counts as bad news.
[00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:46.380]  Boy, must not have been a very nice person.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.321]  She doesn't look like a devil-worshipping meth-head.
[00:09:48.681 --> 00:09:49.161]  He does.
[00:09:51.522 --> 00:09:55.364]  Army says Antifa Portland protester.
[00:09:56.364 --> 00:09:57.685]  Oh, the Daily Mail, he's a protester.
[00:09:57.725 --> 00:10:00.006]  He's not a admitted murderer.
[00:10:00.406 --> 00:10:02.047]  Never served in the military.
[00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:04.268]  But he said he did!
[00:10:07.377 --> 00:10:15.912]  Every study shows leftists are the biggest liars on the planet, and they're the biggest virtue-signalers on the planet, and they're the laziest scum on the planet.
[00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:34.101]  Meanwhile, video, Instagram video, shows Deion K, that they call the little boy, he was 18 years old, in thug videos, with ski mask friends, talking about their exploits, and in the video, he's waving a gun at the police, and people are mad they shot him.
[00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:39.925]  Waving a gun at the police, it's like, when Antifa walks up to your car and aims a gun at you, you're supposed to just bow down to them.
[00:10:42.401 --> 00:10:42.661]  Let's go
[00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.915]  They pay like 5% for their credit card processing and have to use like a shady one basically.
[00:11:09.716 --> 00:11:13.960]  This is how they're driving everybody into the margins who are good and hardworking.
[00:11:16.984 --> 00:11:18.605]  It just continues on from there.
[00:11:18.885 --> 00:11:25.132]  Meanwhile, professor put on leave after students are offended by Chinese word that sounds like the n-word.
[00:11:26.616 --> 00:11:29.899]  And now they're announcing other words that sound like it are being banned.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.020]  My God.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.081]  Talk about superstition.
[00:11:32.462 --> 00:11:33.503]  Talk about mindlessness.
[00:11:33.803 --> 00:11:38.067]  While we're all losing our basic freedoms.
[00:11:38.588 --> 00:11:42.932]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott says he's considering state control of Austin's police department.
[00:11:43.332 --> 00:11:45.675]  You see, cities and counties are under the state.
[00:11:46.636 --> 00:11:46.816]  I think?
[00:12:03.075 --> 00:12:12.944]  District attorneys put in, but the governors and the legislators can just render them powerless and come in and remove them or make them where they are toothless.
[00:12:13.364 --> 00:12:14.365]  And that's what needs to happen.
[00:12:14.605 --> 00:12:16.046]  That's extremely constitutional.
[00:12:16.286 --> 00:12:18.929]  The mayor is calling it, you know, police state and all this crap.
[00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:20.510]  No, the mayor's the police state.
[00:12:21.691 --> 00:12:28.377]  Meanwhile, as I mentioned, Dox Pito, allegedly shot by Kyle Rittenhouse, sodomized, molested multiple boys.
[00:12:28.637 --> 00:12:30.599]  He kidnapped as young as seven.
[00:12:32.605 --> 00:12:44.630]  And he was leading the attack, and even the New York Times admits that someone fired a gun in the direction of Renton House before he shot in the torso and the head of Mr. Peto.
[00:12:48.091 --> 00:12:53.053]  That is one stack out of more than 10 stacks we've got here.
[00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:54.814]  Let me just tell you what's in this stack.
[00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:57.335]  This is a really important stack today, the COVID stack.
[00:12:58.362 --> 00:12:59.283]  COVID on campus.
[00:12:59.323 --> 00:13:04.448]  In nearly 5,000 cases identified, none hospitalized, zero deaths.
[00:13:04.948 --> 00:13:06.550]  It's time to play football, Big Ten.
[00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:10.433]  Zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:13:10.473 --> 00:13:11.474]  Just in these latest testing.
[00:13:13.456 --> 00:13:16.559]  And again, the tests are designed to be false positive 90 plus percent, as we told you.
[00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:17.980]  Now, even the New York Times asked about that.
[00:13:19.161 --> 00:13:19.962]  COVID dissident.
[00:13:20.022 --> 00:13:20.863]  We'll play this coming up.
[00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:22.523]  We're good to go.
[00:13:47.443 --> 00:13:49.125]  Muzzle masks for dogs now!
[00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:50.828]  Yes, your dog is evil.
[00:13:50.848 --> 00:13:52.370]  Need to muzzle mask them or you're bad.
[00:13:52.671 --> 00:13:56.896]  Pet owners may wear masks together in post-COVID new idiot-limbing normal.
[00:13:58.439 --> 00:14:03.125]  Meanwhile, Russia's COVID-19 vaccine generated an immune system response, they say.
[00:14:04.342 --> 00:14:05.223]  Yeah, I'm not going near it.
[00:14:05.723 --> 00:14:10.925]  One-third of Big Ten athletes, again, with COVID-19 have heart inflammation.
[00:14:11.245 --> 00:14:15.607]  Penn State doctor says, now the doctor says, oh, that was an interpretation of what he said.
[00:14:15.627 --> 00:14:16.347]  He has no evidence.
[00:14:16.607 --> 00:14:17.287]  It's not true.
[00:14:17.968 --> 00:14:18.548]  Not true.
[00:14:18.928 --> 00:14:19.448]  Not true.
[00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:20.569]  He examined no one.
[00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:21.569]  Saw nothing.
[00:14:21.869 --> 00:14:23.610]  Saw an article about heart inflammation.
[00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:24.650]  It's self-fake.
[00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:26.631]  All of it paid for by Bill Gates.
[00:14:29.312 --> 00:14:32.014]  The latest Trump mocks the way Biden wears a mask.
[00:14:32.054 --> 00:14:32.994]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:37.341]  So that's just some of the COVID-19 news.
[00:14:37.922 --> 00:14:43.867]  Continuing here with what's coming up, Joe Biden rewrites history.
[00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:44.968]  Well, that's all they do.
[00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:51.254]  Tells Wisconsin audience that Thomas Edison was black.
[00:14:52.735 --> 00:14:53.316]  I'm not kidding.
[00:14:54.457 --> 00:14:55.938]  And look for snopes to say it's true.
[00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.520]  I mean, if Biden says it, it's got to be true.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.122]  I mean, 2.5 million Americans died of COVID.
[00:15:00.162 --> 00:15:00.742]  I mean, well, he said,
[00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.812]  He said 8 billion died.
[00:15:02.832 --> 00:15:03.112]  Remember?
[00:15:03.613 --> 00:15:05.255]  There's not 8 billion people alive, but whatever.
[00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:10.362]  Joe Biden rewrites history, tells Wisconsin audience a black guy invented the light bulb.
[00:15:10.822 --> 00:15:11.203]  I love it.
[00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:12.865]  Hey, I wish!
[00:15:13.988 --> 00:15:15.708]  Africa invented a lightbulb or something.
[00:15:15.728 --> 00:15:17.289]  We wouldn't have all the killing and stuff going on.
[00:15:17.489 --> 00:15:18.989]  And there was some stuff invented in Africa.
[00:15:19.929 --> 00:15:20.790]  In North Africa.
[00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:25.791]  But I mean, just this cultural appropriation that white people never done anything good.
[00:15:26.171 --> 00:15:34.553]  That's going on in Europe and in the BBC where all the shows now show ancient Britons and like half of them are black.
[00:15:35.493 --> 00:15:37.274]  There weren't any black people in Britain 2,000 years ago.
[00:15:37.314 --> 00:15:40.995]  And 2,000 years ago, it was a Roman colony
[00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:49.205]  And the people were slaves, and they lived in stone houses and huts.
[00:15:49.305 --> 00:15:51.187]  I mean, it's just like the Africans were.
[00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:55.270]  I mean, it's just total, absolute crap, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:56.071 --> 00:15:57.812]  And it's not taking something away from black people.
[00:15:58.093 --> 00:16:05.959]  The mental illness of the left making movies where you'll see ancient Rome and a third of the people are black.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.541]  There were some black people there, maybe one out of a thousand.
[00:16:10.383 --> 00:16:11.144]  But the Romans
[00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:16.562]  took white slaves so they didn't have black slaves from the African slave trade.
[00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:18.543]  The Arabs liked black slaves.
[00:16:19.163 --> 00:16:21.224]  The Romans wanted white slaves for whatever reason.
[00:16:23.164 --> 00:16:25.285]  That's why they were in Albion.
[00:16:25.325 --> 00:16:26.405]  That's why they were in Gaul.
[00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:27.606]  That's why they were in Germania.
[00:16:27.806 --> 00:16:32.267]  That's why they were in the kingdoms of the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths.
[00:16:33.267 --> 00:16:34.068]  Again, that's history.
[00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:39.169]  It's all being rewritten mindlessly because you can't have any European history.
[00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:40.510]  You can't have any of that.
[00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:40.770]  No!
[00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:42.652]  No, no, no!
[00:16:43.713 --> 00:16:44.573]  That's all coming up.
[00:16:45.274 --> 00:16:47.715]  There's so much to cover today, I only scratched the surface.
[00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:53.618]  A lot of child trafficking news coming out, really scaring the left as it turns out it's their big business.
[00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:56.039]  Ann Snowden's been vindicated.
[00:16:56.439 --> 00:16:57.000]  Stay with us.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.380]  Infowars.com.
[00:16:58.721 --> 00:17:00.041]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:17:00.962 --> 00:17:07.245]  Well, Bill Clinton has done another little Skype or Zoom interview with one of his minions.
[00:17:09.188 --> 00:17:16.935]  And he says Trump's going to sandbag himself inside the White House and refuse to leave.
[00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:22.020]  That's the same talking point out of Biden, out of Hillary, out of Eric Holder, out of all of them.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:29.786]  And you notice again, 14 months ago, I began to see Atlantic Monthly as one of the most important globalist publications.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.783]  It puts out the talking points a lot of times before the New York Times does, and the New York Times follows their lead.
[00:17:36.543 --> 00:17:40.425]  So I've identified it as a major command base, and they admit they are, for disinfo.
[00:17:40.445 --> 00:17:46.389]  That's why they've come out and said, unnamed sources said Trump said, I hate the military, they're such losers.
[00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:55.114]  Of course, everybody knows that Trump fetishizes the military, because his dad really respected it.
[00:17:55.154 --> 00:17:56.254]  He went to military academy.
[00:17:56.594 --> 00:17:58.195]  A lot of times he wished he'd been in the military.
[00:17:59.901 --> 00:18:06.704]  Got the ratings from veterans up from about 10% to 87% at the VA.
[00:18:07.124 --> 00:18:13.466]  He got it opened up where if they don't give somebody pretty much immediate care, they can go to a private facility of their choosing.
[00:18:13.706 --> 00:18:14.807]  He brought competition to it.
[00:18:15.947 --> 00:18:26.211]  But because there was a tornado warning, a huge storm warning, when they were going to a cemetery a few years ago, they said, no sir, we're not flying the helicopters over there.
[00:18:26.591 --> 00:18:28.272]  Because the rain was coming down sideways.
[00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:33.193]  Now they've gone to the official people that were there, they said we grounded it, not him.
[00:18:34.034 --> 00:18:36.875]  But they go, oh, remember when he didn't lay a reef two years ago?
[00:18:37.435 --> 00:18:43.697]  He said in front of everyone, when half the people at the White House are veterans, I hate the military!
[00:18:43.917 --> 00:18:44.958]  You're stupid losers!
[00:18:45.818 --> 00:18:47.919]  Who believes any of this?
[00:18:49.701 --> 00:18:54.924]  The same media says that I say there are slave colonies on Mars with American children.
[00:18:55.665 --> 00:18:57.706]  I offered a $1 million reward for where I said that.
[00:18:57.746 --> 00:19:00.748]  I never said that, but Mainline News with that headline.
[00:19:01.188 --> 00:19:12.736]  They said I lost the suit in Sandy Hook for a book titled, and AP ran this, and Market Watch, owned by the Wall Street Journal, owned by Fox.
[00:19:13.937 --> 00:19:15.738]  They ran a headline saying,
[00:19:17.102 --> 00:19:20.545]  Alex Jones lost Sandy Hook lawsuit for a book, No One Died as Sandy Hook.
[00:19:22.466 --> 00:19:23.407]  I've never read the book.
[00:19:23.707 --> 00:19:24.748]  I'm not in the book, I'm told.
[00:19:24.768 --> 00:19:28.650]  I haven't interviewed Professor Fetzer about his book.
[00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:32.533]  But we had lawyers send him letters and they said, go ahead and sue us, we don't care.
[00:19:34.094 --> 00:19:36.016]  Because they want the perception of that.
[00:19:37.028 --> 00:19:42.433]  Because they use that in filings against me to tell banks that I'm a bad business, I've lost a lawsuit.
[00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:43.414]  We found out what they did.
[00:19:43.894 --> 00:19:47.978]  And I'm in the process of probably going ahead and just having to sue G2 over this.
[00:19:48.638 --> 00:19:51.361]  But that's why they engage in criminal activity.
[00:19:51.941 --> 00:20:00.129]  Because they will take a certified lie like that, but if it's in mainstream news, it is used as proof
[00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:06.833]  That's how they can look at Sean King, who obviously doesn't have a drop of African in him.
[00:20:07.394 --> 00:20:10.035]  But if he says he's black and they say he's black, he is.
[00:20:10.456 --> 00:20:12.737]  And they've got new people coming out that turns out aren't black at all.
[00:20:14.258 --> 00:20:20.202]  People with blonde hair and blue eyes, folks, go kink their hair and put on brown contacts and skin toner.
[00:20:22.963 --> 00:20:24.504]  And then the news tells you they're black.
[00:20:25.785 --> 00:20:31.489]  Just like a man with a foot-long tally-whacker who can go into the British government
[00:20:33.976 --> 00:20:38.818]  And have them order a female nurse to do a pap smear when there is no cervix.
[00:20:39.298 --> 00:20:41.199]  And if the nurse doesn't do it, she's fired.
[00:20:41.859 --> 00:20:49.262]  That's abusing a woman with a mentally ill person, and the state's saying, you will pap smear his penis.
[00:20:51.403 --> 00:20:51.963]  That's on record.
[00:20:52.023 --> 00:20:53.564]  And you're like, why would they do that?
[00:20:53.584 --> 00:20:54.104]  That's crazy.
[00:20:54.564 --> 00:20:55.485]  No, it's a cult.
[00:20:56.903 --> 00:20:58.884]  They tell you 2.5 million are going to die.
[00:20:59.345 --> 00:21:00.766]  Then they use all these fake numbers.
[00:21:00.786 --> 00:21:02.186]  They're caught lying about everything.
[00:21:02.206 --> 00:21:04.408]  Whole meat packing plants are tested.
[00:21:05.008 --> 00:21:06.449]  Half the people have it.
[00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.891]  Then of course none of them get sick because they don't have it.
[00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:11.673]  But they don't care.
[00:21:11.913 --> 00:21:13.054]  They keep pressing.
[00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:19.358]  And so it's now a trillion percent on record that they are going to contest the election.
[00:21:21.087 --> 00:21:27.589]  And then when Trump contests it and says this is fraudulent, with their mail-in ballots that have proven to be frauds, they're going to say, well, we're not leaving.
[00:21:28.009 --> 00:21:39.732]  And under the Constitution, on January 20th, if it's not been chosen, the president has to leave office and Nancy Pelosi becomes president.
[00:21:39.992 --> 00:21:43.693]  And that's why she said, I've met with the COG.
[00:21:45.494 --> 00:21:46.474]  That's the Continental Government.
[00:21:47.194 --> 00:21:47.874]  That's FEMA.
[00:21:48.615 --> 00:21:49.335]  That's the Deep State.
[00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:53.597]  And I am in second command and I will be president.
[00:21:54.257 --> 00:21:56.118]  Should I play the clip again for you from a month ago?
[00:21:56.638 --> 00:21:57.138]  Five weeks ago?
[00:21:57.179 --> 00:21:58.159]  I played it probably 35 times.
[00:21:58.179 --> 00:21:58.659]  Serious.
[00:21:58.679 --> 00:22:01.160]  You want me to get it for you again?
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.462]  Because she didn't say that for no reason.
[00:22:05.522 --> 00:22:06.402]  They're going to do it!
[00:22:08.042 --> 00:22:09.163]  So I'm going to ask you all a question.
[00:22:10.003 --> 00:22:12.004]  What are we going to do about that?
[00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:33.486]  We have to have the states certify when these ballots are fraudulent, and they are, on record, that they are frauds, and we have to boldly be out in the streets saying no, and there's got to be lawsuits filed at every level immediately to block the left of the globalists, and Trump has to rally the people and have it declared that he won.
[00:22:35.508 --> 00:22:40.031]  But if they can push it out, they're going to have civil unrest, the economy's going to implode even worse.
[00:22:40.914 --> 00:22:45.137]  I predict the deep state will release a more virulent form of COVID-19.
[00:22:47.199 --> 00:23:00.149]  They have this whole war game now where it's going to be weak, it's not going to kill many, they'll be caught with fake numbers, they'll seem illegitimate, people will be pissed, and then new strains will be released of a super pneumonia that is going to just devastate.
[00:23:02.931 --> 00:23:04.472]  I'm pretty sure that's what they're going to pull.
[00:23:04.492 --> 00:23:06.734]  I mean, I can look at all the pieces and that's what I would do if I was them.
[00:23:09.619 --> 00:23:22.187]  That's why separately, if you have super amounts of vitamin D3, vitamin C, and zinc in your blood, you basically cannot get these viruses.
[00:23:22.227 --> 00:23:35.356]  That's on the NIH website that they're essential and that viruses cannot replicate in the mitochondria if you have high levels of zinc, D3, and C. And so,
[00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:47.918]  That's why they don't want anyone knowing that, and that's why they're running around telling everybody that, you know, there's nothing that can help you, you're all gonna die, because they want you to just sit there and die.
[00:23:48.834 --> 00:23:50.055]  And why does it kill so many old people?
[00:23:50.075 --> 00:23:56.139]  They're inside, they're not in the light, and the intestines, as you get older, stop absorbing as much nutrients.
[00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:59.401]  That's why old people need higher recommended daily allowances.
[00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:00.482]  That's in all the studies.
[00:24:00.842 --> 00:24:03.984]  And they've got horrible processed crap food in the nursing homes.
[00:24:04.644 --> 00:24:15.652]  For God's sakes, man, go volunteer locally, bring your dog in, let the old people pet him, wheel him out in the sunshine, bring a little sunshine lamp in the winter for him, and treat him with a little bit of dignity.
[00:24:15.932 --> 00:24:17.333]  And don't let him just kill him this winter.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:28.587]  Because they're gonna wipe out, and that's, that's, that's, this whole Globalist plan has all these facets, and it's designed to hit every one of the, it's a symphony of destruction.
[00:24:29.567 --> 00:24:30.588]  It's a symphony of evil.
[00:24:31.409 --> 00:24:35.051]  And Bill Gates is obsessed with getting rid of old people and euthanizing, and he said that.
[00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:38.213]  And so, this is designed to kill old people.
[00:24:38.953 --> 00:24:40.635]  That's why almost all the deaths have been above 80.
[00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:44.457]  Or had serious comorbidity, other serious problems.
[00:24:45.157 --> 00:24:45.698]  And, and so,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:53.902]  The stronger version will be the same, but it will kill almost everyone above the age of 65 that comes in contact with it.
[00:24:54.062 --> 00:24:58.683]  Then there'll be a total lockdown, and then they'll roll out the tracker chips and all that.
[00:24:58.723 --> 00:25:02.164]  But see, Trump isn't going along with that, so he's got to be removed.
[00:25:02.464 --> 00:25:03.585]  This is such a big battle.
[00:25:03.605 --> 00:25:04.605]  It's a lot bigger than Trump.
[00:25:04.965 --> 00:25:06.006]  This is for all the marbles.
[00:25:06.026 --> 00:25:08.066]  They're making their move against humanity.
[00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:09.167]  We'll play all those clips coming up.
[00:25:10.387 --> 00:25:12.407]  Watch people's heads begin to roll.
[00:25:12.427 --> 00:25:16.109]  Roll!
[00:25:20.009 --> 00:25:23.691]  Just like the Pied Piper, let the rats loose!
[00:25:24.631 --> 00:25:29.153]  Just like the Pied Piper, you swing to the symphony of destruction.
[00:25:32.895 --> 00:25:34.556]  Let rats loose!
[00:25:39.718 --> 00:25:41.879]  Swing to the symphony!
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.961]  Actin' like a robot!
[00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:51.891]  It's metal head corrodes.
[00:25:56.995 --> 00:25:58.056]  Alright, let's get into it right now.
[00:25:59.437 --> 00:26:03.620]  Speaking of it's metal head corroding, it's cranium.
[00:26:05.722 --> 00:26:07.704]  Bill Clinton looking particularly evil.
[00:26:09.185 --> 00:26:12.548]  Gleaming with predatory hate.
[00:26:13.795 --> 00:26:38.206]  Staring through a zoom portal at the rest of us like a demon in another dimension He said Trump is gonna barricade himself in and with sandbags and the same thing the military is gonna have to come dig him out so that they just keep setting the stage for this and they've told us that's what we're gonna do and they've pumped out from their own cities and states the illegal ballots that are Again, they had a Jimmy Carter Commission.
[00:26:38.307 --> 00:26:39.627]  In fact, you guys pull up the clip.
[00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:41.168]  I didn't blow yesterday a William Barr and
[00:26:42.466 --> 00:26:49.408]  On Wolf Blitzer, where he explains, you know, there was a bipartisan commission that found these random mail-in ballots are the recipe of fraud.
[00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:52.729]  And they're illegal in more than 15 states.
[00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.271]  They just keep going, oh, these are like absentee ballots.
[00:26:56.291 --> 00:26:56.731]  No, they're not.
[00:26:58.751 --> 00:27:02.773]  You request an absentee ballot, you get it, it's on the rolls, you send it in.
[00:27:02.813 --> 00:27:07.894]  And by the way, they're constantly, the Democrats are always snatching and stealing and manipulating those.
[00:27:07.954 --> 00:27:09.435]  And they've convicted so many.
[00:27:11.428 --> 00:27:16.151]  Postal carriers of messing with ballots before it'll make your head spin.
[00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:24.716]  They busted a bunch just the last few weeks because people are so crazy.
[00:27:24.756 --> 00:27:28.438]  In fact, before we play the Clintons, let's play Barr with Will Blitzer.
[00:27:28.478 --> 00:27:28.818]  Here it is.
[00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:31.860]  I don't know what the law in that particular state says.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.581]  Is there any state that says you can vote twice?
[00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:55.323]  Well, there's some, you know, maybe that you can change your vote up to a particular term.
[00:27:55.423 --> 00:27:56.504]  I don't know what the law is.
[00:27:56.584 --> 00:27:57.305]  I'm not going to offer.
[00:27:57.385 --> 00:27:59.146]  He was saying test the system.
[00:27:59.286 --> 00:28:00.006]  You know what he's saying?
[00:28:00.046 --> 00:28:01.647]  Why are you asking me what he's saying?
[00:28:01.747 --> 00:28:03.248]  He doesn't believe in the mail-in voting.
[00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:05.730]  You're the Attorney General of the United States.
[00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:11.173]  You know, he said if you expand mail-in voting, this is the President.
[00:28:11.193 --> 00:28:11.833]  He's reckless.
[00:28:14.096 --> 00:28:32.246]  This is a, you know, sort of cheap talk to get around the fundamental problem, which is the bipartisan commission chaired by Jimmy Carter and James Baker said back in 2009 that mail-in voting is fraught with the risk of fraud and coercion.
[00:28:32.266 --> 00:28:35.828]  But since then, you're in a lot of investigations that haven't improved it.
[00:28:36.108 --> 00:28:36.669]  Let me talk.
[00:28:36.709 --> 00:28:37.209]  Yeah, please.
[00:28:38.327 --> 00:28:49.292]  And since that time, there have been, in the newspapers, in networks, academic studies saying it is open to fraud and coercion.
[00:28:49.772 --> 00:28:53.654]  The only time the narrative changed is after this administration came in.
[00:28:54.014 --> 00:28:59.196]  But elections that have been held, with mail, have found substantial fraud and coercion.
[00:28:59.416 --> 00:29:02.297]  For example, we indicted someone in Texas, 1,700 ballots collected,
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.898]  From people who could vote, he made them out and voted for the person he wanted to.
[00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.593]  Okay, because that kind of thing happens with mail-in ballots and everyone knows it.
[00:29:14.613 --> 00:29:24.940]  But there are individual cases, but as far as widespread fraud, we haven't seen that since... Well, we haven't had the kind of widespread use of mail-in ballots as being proposed.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.303]  We've had absentee ballots from people who request them from a specific address.
[00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:35.888]  Now what we're talking about is mailing them to everyone on the voter list when everyone knows those voter lists are inaccurate.
[00:29:36.368 --> 00:29:43.953]  People who should get them don't get them, which has been one of the major complaints in states that have tried this in municipal elections.
[00:29:44.593 --> 00:29:48.396]  And people who get them are not the right people.
[00:29:48.436 --> 00:29:52.538]  They're people who have replaced the previous occupant, and they can make them out.
[00:29:52.578 --> 00:29:56.361]  And sometimes multiple ballots come to the same address with a whole generation.
[00:29:58.041 --> 00:29:58.942]  I just like Barr.
[00:29:59.462 --> 00:30:00.803]  I mean, he's so well-spoken.
[00:30:00.823 --> 00:30:02.184]  If he had a talk show, I'd watch it.
[00:30:02.924 --> 00:30:04.205]  I hear him on every subject.
[00:30:04.245 --> 00:30:06.146]  It's like he actually knows what he's talking about.
[00:30:07.948 --> 00:30:12.951]  And he has an establishment, but the old establishment that just wanted to run America and be rich and powerful.
[00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:20.036]  The new one is Chai Com Globalist and wants to wreck it and then buy it all up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:30:21.116 --> 00:30:26.460]  So I don't lionize Barr, but he understands that you've got to stop this New World Order takeover.
[00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:29.964]  Because Americans are going to fight it, you're going to have a civil war.
[00:30:30.825 --> 00:30:32.926]  Anybody that's smart knows they're going to lose it.
[00:30:34.127 --> 00:30:35.428]  Do I want to have this happen?
[00:30:35.749 --> 00:30:35.969]  No.
[00:30:36.729 --> 00:30:41.113]  Because it's destructive, it's dumb, and our enemies will sit back and laugh at it.
[00:30:41.733 --> 00:30:46.718]  At some primitive level, do I want to crack some heads and, you know, metaphysically piss on people that have done this to us?
[00:30:46.998 --> 00:30:49.640]  Damn right I do, but I'd rather not go down that road.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:50.381]  But I'll tell you.
[00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:57.783]  We go down this road, I probably won't survive it, a lot of you won't survive it, but the enemy will be annihilated.
[00:30:58.583 --> 00:30:59.883]  This won't be like other wars.
[00:31:00.383 --> 00:31:04.444]  They will be ideologically hunt down and dealt with because they're doing it to us.
[00:31:04.485 --> 00:31:05.965]  They're trying to purge us.
[00:31:06.285 --> 00:31:13.787]  They're trying to annihilate us and saying they're going to annihilate us because we're an open free society and these are authoritarians and they think we're weak.
[00:31:16.513 --> 00:31:20.034]  And people like Nadler get up there and they go, oh, Antifa's rioting.
[00:31:20.054 --> 00:31:21.375]  He goes, it doesn't exist.
[00:31:22.215 --> 00:31:27.197]  And I've had friends and family tell me, they've had leftists tell them, Antifa doesn't exist.
[00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:34.941]  And that's just like when they go, pedophilia isn't going on while all their publications promote it, because a bunch of them are pedophiles.
[00:31:35.841 --> 00:31:37.822]  They've really infected a lot of people.
[00:31:38.202 --> 00:31:39.723]  We've really got a case of evil.
[00:31:41.183 --> 00:31:42.664]  And speaking of that, let's just go to this club.
[00:31:44.138 --> 00:31:46.459]  I'll play the COVID dissident being violently attacked next segment.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.301]  This is bad out of Australia, but let's play this now.
[00:31:50.442 --> 00:31:55.865]  Let's play Joe Biden saying that a black person invented the light bulb.
[00:31:55.905 --> 00:32:04.109]  Now, back when I was a kid from Schoolhouse Rock, by the time I was four years old, I knew Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.
[00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.771]  And the telephone.
[00:32:08.031 --> 00:32:09.052]  And a bunch of other stuff.
[00:32:10.453 --> 00:32:12.174]  And that Marconi invented the radio.
[00:32:13.353 --> 00:32:15.213]  I mean, when I was five years old, I knew stuff like that.
[00:32:17.244 --> 00:32:22.567]  But you don't get that in cartoons now, and cartoons literally have pedophile crap in them for five-year-olds now.
[00:32:22.787 --> 00:32:25.909]  They teach five-year-olds how to masturbate in public school now.
[00:32:26.289 --> 00:32:27.890]  I mean, this is just over the top, man.
[00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.171]  They want to ruin our children's innocence.
[00:32:30.872 --> 00:32:38.856]  Because statistically, it lowers their IQ and screws them up and makes them zombies, and makes them 50% of the time in every major study, roughly.
[00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:40.097]  Some are 45, some 60.
[00:32:40.818 --> 00:32:44.380]  The studies upwards of 50% or higher become pedophiles.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.284]  So like vampires that bite you, and you become one if they don't drain you?
[00:32:48.304 --> 00:32:49.305]  It's the same thing.
[00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:52.248]  Spiritually, as an archetype, they become pedophiles.
[00:32:53.309 --> 00:32:55.591]  And the more they rape, the more they create.
[00:32:56.853 --> 00:33:01.057]  Because the human adapts to the abuse, and under Stockholm Syndrome, accepts it.
[00:33:01.978 --> 00:33:03.860]  Here he is saying a black person invented the lightbulb.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.663]  It'll be a whole heck of a lot better.
[00:33:08.126 --> 00:33:10.068]  We'll move a lot further down the road.
[00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:14.171]  People fear that which is different.
[00:33:15.832 --> 00:33:22.297]  We gotta, for example, why in God's name don't we teach history in history classes?
[00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:27.621]  A black man invented the light bulb, not a white guy named Edison.
[00:33:29.202 --> 00:33:29.563]  Okay?
[00:33:30.724 --> 00:33:31.704]  There's so much.
[00:33:31.925 --> 00:33:35.668]  Did anybody know before what recently happened?
[00:33:36.792 --> 00:33:39.473]  That black Wall Street in Oklahoma was burned to the ground?
[00:33:41.694 --> 00:33:42.714]  Anybody know these things?
[00:33:42.734 --> 00:33:44.255]  We act because we don't teach them.
[00:33:46.436 --> 00:33:47.776]  We gotta give people facts.
[00:33:48.676 --> 00:33:49.217]  Oh, that's enough.
[00:33:49.377 --> 00:33:51.717]  By the way, he does that on purpose, okay?
[00:33:51.998 --> 00:33:53.118]  That's not just the senility.
[00:33:53.178 --> 00:33:55.579]  It's like saying it's a European virus.
[00:33:58.416 --> 00:34:00.017]  Again, it's just, it's unbelievable.
[00:34:00.598 --> 00:34:04.581]  It's all about racial division, and it's about making you see everything as something racial.
[00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:06.162]  Okay, I get it.
[00:34:06.242 --> 00:34:08.884]  The telephone, the computer, it all got invented in Wakanda.
[00:34:09.565 --> 00:34:10.425]  By the Black Panther.
[00:34:12.027 --> 00:34:14.649]  But they couldn't invent a cure to cancer in Wakanda.
[00:34:15.089 --> 00:34:16.670]  I wish Wakanda existed.
[00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.511]  I'd go visit there.
[00:34:17.531 --> 00:34:19.352]  If it was a free country, I'd move there.
[00:34:19.953 --> 00:34:20.593]  We are back.
[00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:22.255]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:34:22.275 --> 00:34:23.255]  Thank you for listening to us.
[00:34:24.175 --> 00:34:27.598]  Thank you for checking out our claims, and then thank you for taking action.
[00:34:27.638 --> 00:34:47.053]  We are 59 days out from this consortium of foreign powers and megacorporations that are setting up their private corporate world government, throwing the country into further disarray, attempting to crash the stock market, attempting to keep you out of work, attempting to stop our recovery, because it's about global governance.
[00:34:47.734 --> 00:34:48.655]  What is the new world order?
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:35:06.264]  It is a group of megabanks and corporations, according to John D. Rockefeller, David Rockefeller, all of them are on record in the Council on Foreign Relations publication, going back to 1922, with the plan to transfer power out to corporations who would then form their own private global government.
[00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:11.305]  And they're going to do it, and now the Clintons have come out and said, that's the plan.
[00:35:12.065 --> 00:35:13.466]  Because they know we've exposed their plan.
[00:35:14.146 --> 00:35:18.187]  They know that we are out there doing countermeasures to warn people about it.
[00:35:20.546 --> 00:35:22.047]  And so they went ahead and came out.
[00:35:22.107 --> 00:35:31.910]  We forced them to go public, and that's my job, is to cover the topics that other people are aware of, but they know you will be censored or taken off the air for.
[00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:36.272]  We have to normalize the truth and make it safe for others.
[00:35:36.352 --> 00:35:45.836]  InfoWars is about being shock troops that go in and smash the enemy's gateways to then draw out the enemy so we know their real numbers.
[00:35:46.676 --> 00:35:51.598]  As a gambit, as a pawn sacrifice, so that the main force can come in and win.
[00:35:51.978 --> 00:35:55.960]  And that's always been my instinctive job, is the pawn sacrifice.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.421]  I am the pawn.
[00:35:57.661 --> 00:35:58.741]  I am here to be sacrificed.
[00:35:59.982 --> 00:36:07.545]  But I will tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that we have more to do before we reach that point.
[00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:13.968]  But it is my intent to become so destructive to the New World Order, that they are forced to move.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.261]  You don't think Colonel Travis wasn't aware of what he was doing?
[00:36:17.281 --> 00:36:18.241]  He was sent down there.
[00:36:19.622 --> 00:36:25.784]  Sent down there to carry out that mission and hoped he'd live, but wrote home to his family that he would probably surely die.
[00:36:26.244 --> 00:36:27.044]  Victory or death.
[00:36:27.464 --> 00:36:29.885]  Because there's things bigger than just this short life.
[00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:32.206]  There's eternity on the other side.
[00:36:32.226 --> 00:36:34.447]  And when you know that, you're not scared anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:35.287 --> 00:36:37.908]  Now, all of you can decide what you're going to do.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.021]  It's all about pawn sacrifice.
[00:36:41.642 --> 00:36:43.623]  That's how the pawn becomes the king.
[00:36:44.184 --> 00:36:46.005]  And not because the pawn wants to be the king.
[00:36:46.785 --> 00:36:53.230]  The pawn has to sacrifice itself so that the whole system that's good can survive and not have the evil system take over.
[00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.513]  This is the true nature of real leadership.
[00:36:58.454 --> 00:36:59.695]  All right, let's lay it out right now.
[00:37:01.516 --> 00:37:01.816]  COVID-19
[00:37:04.444 --> 00:37:06.145]  is a real man-made virus.
[00:37:06.285 --> 00:37:09.046]  They're going to have more deadly versions they release later, that's totally clear.
[00:37:09.086 --> 00:37:20.232]  It's a franchise owned by Gates, so he can save us from the problem he creates, but really hurt us into the cashless society control grid, and its main aim will be, in this first wave of viruses, to wipe out old people.
[00:37:22.136 --> 00:37:26.318]  And even the Daily Mail has top experts saying there is no second wave, there was never the giant wave.
[00:37:27.219 --> 00:37:30.120]  The government estimates were 20, 30, 40, 50 times bigger than they were.
[00:37:30.561 --> 00:37:31.961]  Those are using numbers of other dead.
[00:37:32.242 --> 00:37:37.004]  It's the same formula all over the world, the same scammers, the same UN program.
[00:37:37.404 --> 00:37:38.605]  That's how this is top-down.
[00:37:40.386 --> 00:37:43.888]  And again, one-third of Big Tech athletes with COVID-19 have heart inflammation.
[00:37:44.668 --> 00:37:50.892]  The doctor came out and said, oh, I just saw something about maybe it causes heart inflammation in a news article, so I just said they have it.
[00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.690]  It is absolutely a lie.
[00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.291]  It's a fraud.
[00:37:56.931 --> 00:38:03.212]  And so more and more, the Democrats are having to come out and say, OK, maybe we are going to end the quarantine.
[00:38:03.572 --> 00:38:05.192]  Maybe we are going to end the total lockdown.
[00:38:05.832 --> 00:38:09.653]  Because the emperor's new clothes are a fraud.
[00:38:09.753 --> 00:38:10.733]  The emperor's butt naked.
[00:38:11.053 --> 00:38:19.455]  Pelosi's been caught throwing her salon under the bus, saying she believed no one would be there so she'd have to wear a mask, as if these elitists don't.
[00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:22.292]  Follow the same rules they give us.
[00:38:22.932 --> 00:38:23.552]  It's disgusting.
[00:38:23.572 --> 00:38:24.472]  It's right there in front of you.
[00:38:25.933 --> 00:38:27.033]  That's what Trump understands.
[00:38:28.694 --> 00:38:42.480]  And then we've got the fact that they did Big Ten testing of 5,000 athletes, not just in the football program, but others, and found zero hospitalizations, illnesses, or deaths.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.541]  Because it's all a giant hoax.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.524]  So what do they do when they know their hoax is falling?
[00:38:50.584 --> 00:39:02.820]  They get cities like New York and other areas they have control like Ohio or places like Madrid that's been under martial laws since Franco got in in the 30s in the Spanish Civil War.
[00:39:04.815 --> 00:39:06.896]  And you've got Australia that's been a prison colony.
[00:39:07.216 --> 00:39:08.737]  You've got Melbourne that's a police state.
[00:39:09.217 --> 00:39:11.879]  And that's a real police state with bad government and bad cops.
[00:39:12.679 --> 00:39:15.721]  Again, cops can be good, just like the US military can be good in World War II.
[00:39:15.761 --> 00:39:19.663]  And the German military was bad because of Hitler, not because the Germans overall were bad.
[00:39:19.683 --> 00:39:20.584]  They had bad leadership.
[00:39:21.364 --> 00:39:23.045]  And Hitler kept what he was doing compartmentalized.
[00:39:23.065 --> 00:39:26.187]  So, when you see these Australian police, these are evil people.
[00:39:26.907 --> 00:39:30.109]  And you look at their eyes, they're evil, they're hateful, they're enjoying what they're doing.
[00:39:30.809 --> 00:39:34.011]  And they come to people's houses now and beat them up.
[00:39:35.148 --> 00:39:39.271]  They choke women on TV because they're not wearing a mask.
[00:39:39.732 --> 00:39:42.073]  Or you're out after your curfew and they choke you.
[00:39:43.394 --> 00:39:46.236]  Because they're there to drive you into submission and scare you.
[00:39:46.297 --> 00:39:53.062]  So masked men, notice it's all very occultic, they come and break in your door and attack you.
[00:39:53.422 --> 00:39:58.446]  COVID dissenter violently arrested after backing Melbourne anti-lockdown protest.
[00:39:59.878 --> 00:40:09.624]  James Bartolo, a former soldier, bodybuilder, and a man who, in his own words, fights against the corrupt and failed system, was raided and attacked for his speech.
[00:40:09.764 --> 00:40:11.705]  This is the new Soviet Union.
[00:40:11.745 --> 00:40:15.007]  This is us becoming North Korea or Communist China.
[00:40:15.027 --> 00:40:16.548]  This is outrageous.
[00:40:17.288 --> 00:40:18.689]  And Australians are getting really pissed.
[00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:22.591]  Even their bar association says it's wrong because they let Black Lives Matter have demonstrations.
[00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:23.812]  And I say they have a right to!
[00:40:27.534 --> 00:40:30.515]  So let's not get caught up in this thing of, oh, Black Lives Matter is endangering us.
[00:40:30.775 --> 00:40:31.335]  It's a hoax.
[00:40:33.555 --> 00:40:35.736]  Don't go, oh, the Democrats don't follow the rules.
[00:40:35.976 --> 00:40:36.556]  They're bad.
[00:40:36.636 --> 00:40:37.156]  Tattle on them.
[00:40:37.236 --> 00:40:38.216]  Because it's all a fraud.
[00:40:38.576 --> 00:40:40.177]  Don't say, oh, look, you're not wearing your mask.
[00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:41.657]  Point out the whole thing's a fraud.
[00:40:42.137 --> 00:40:45.038]  So here's the video of the goons coming.
[00:40:45.718 --> 00:40:48.058]  Masked men to arrest someone for thought crime.
[00:40:48.098 --> 00:40:48.438]  Here it is.
[00:40:49.339 --> 00:40:49.979]  Toilet?
[00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:52.899]  Yeah, I've just gotten up.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:54.820]  What, what, what?
[00:40:56.923 --> 00:40:57.683]  Give me a minute!
[00:40:59.024 --> 00:41:00.725]  Well, what is this in regards to?
[00:41:00.745 --> 00:41:01.605]  What's it in regards to?
[00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.666]  You haven't told me anything.
[00:41:03.706 --> 00:41:04.587]  Incitement for what?
[00:41:08.789 --> 00:41:10.650]  I told them not to go to the protest.
[00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.651]  Well, I'm telling you right now.
[00:41:13.691 --> 00:41:15.572]  I can speak to you right now.
[00:41:16.713 --> 00:41:17.913]  Why do you want me to open the door?
[00:41:17.933 --> 00:41:19.154]  I'm speaking to you guys right now.
[00:41:19.174 --> 00:41:19.234]  Why?
[00:41:22.398 --> 00:41:27.180]  Well, just explain what you're doing first, and then perhaps I'll comply easily.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.281]  But you're just yelling, you've got people everywhere.
[00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:31.441]  Explain!
[00:41:32.041 --> 00:41:33.802]  Explain, just talk to me properly.
[00:41:34.502 --> 00:41:36.222]  Like, what is going on?
[00:41:36.563 --> 00:41:41.544]  You've just rocked up with force, you've got no idea, like early in the morning.
[00:41:42.064 --> 00:41:44.545]  Can you just explain, and then I will open the door.
[00:41:46.266 --> 00:41:47.106]  What's it to do with?
[00:41:50.034 --> 00:41:51.275]  Ned, hold on.
[00:41:51.896 --> 00:41:53.417]  What's it to do with though?
[00:41:53.817 --> 00:41:54.638]  What have I done?
[00:41:54.658 --> 00:41:56.719]  I told you to come down and open the door.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.461]  But you didn't tell me.
[00:41:58.481 --> 00:41:59.121]  We did.
[00:41:59.421 --> 00:42:00.242]  We've got a search warrant.
[00:42:00.542 --> 00:42:01.883]  Yeah, okay, search warrant for what?
[00:42:02.284 --> 00:42:04.005]  What are you suspecting me of doing?
[00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:07.428]  He said he's going to come downstairs.
[00:42:07.468 --> 00:42:10.090]  He's not, so... Yeah, to do with what?
[00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:14.998]  No, if you do that, I will charge every single one of you.
[00:42:15.018 --> 00:42:16.579]  I'll take you to court and you're going to lose.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.102]  Look at that no trespassing sign, yeah?
[00:42:19.502 --> 00:42:23.626]  There's seven court case precedents from the Supreme and High Courts of Australia.
[00:42:24.507 --> 00:42:26.669]  Yeah, because I'm trying to talk to you first.
[00:42:26.689 --> 00:42:28.150]  You're not telling me what you're doing.
[00:42:29.051 --> 00:42:29.592]  Yeah, what's it?
[00:42:29.792 --> 00:42:30.713]  Search warrant for what?
[00:42:31.173 --> 00:42:33.195]  What gives you the authority to have a search warrant?
[00:42:33.716 --> 00:42:33.976]  Whoa!
[00:42:34.336 --> 00:42:35.017]  You do that?
[00:42:36.378 --> 00:42:36.759]  You know what?
[00:42:38.755 --> 00:42:39.815]  Leave my s**t!
[00:42:39.935 --> 00:42:42.476]  Don't break my stuff, you f**king retard!
[00:42:48.959 --> 00:42:49.279]  Hey!
[00:42:49.439 --> 00:42:50.239]  Stop breaking my s**t!
[00:42:50.259 --> 00:42:50.559]  Leave my s**t!
[00:42:50.599 --> 00:42:51.180]  Woah, woah, woah!
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:51.260]  Hey!
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:51.340]  Hey!
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.060]  Stop!
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:07.866]  I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll
[00:43:08.359 --> 00:43:18.804]  This is secret police, this is tyranny, and they've announced the Global Clinton Initiative runs this worldwide, and it's getting money from dozens of countries and hundreds of states.
[00:43:19.264 --> 00:43:25.948]  The Global Clinton Initiative gets part of the money from Google that Governor Abbott gave them, hundreds of millions, to run contact tracing in Texas.
[00:43:26.648 --> 00:43:33.391]  They're already tracking your phones, they're already controlling you, it's the social credit score rollout, and they're getting the money for it.
[00:43:34.332 --> 00:43:34.552]  Okay?
[00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:39.214]  And it's totally criminal and it's going to be used to track you forever now.
[00:43:40.655 --> 00:43:43.499]  And they're coming with the forced inoculations, they're coming with the apps.
[00:43:44.199 --> 00:43:45.781]  It's absolutely out of control.
[00:43:47.063 --> 00:43:47.303]  Abbott?
[00:43:49.761 --> 00:43:53.383]  He gave $295 million to these people, and part of it went to the Clintons.
[00:43:53.944 --> 00:43:57.646]  Abbott is either super stupid, which he's not, or he has sold us out.
[00:43:58.486 --> 00:44:00.527]  And it's really a sad thing to watch this treason.
[00:44:01.528 --> 00:44:01.988]  Disgusting.
[00:44:02.488 --> 00:44:03.409]  It's absolutely unbelievable.
[00:44:03.669 --> 00:44:05.570]  I want to thank you all for your support yesterday.
[00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:07.191]  I fired the bat signal out to people.
[00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.732]  There's 100% what's going on.
[00:44:08.752 --> 00:44:11.934]  I hope at some point people will let you know what's happening, but I think you're smart and can figure it out.
[00:44:12.654 --> 00:44:19.018]  If you want to get products, t-shirts, books, films, supplements, you need to get them now while you're able to still even operate and get you this.
[00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:22.321]  We need your financial support so we can continue to operate.
[00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:25.963]  I need to know how much money we're going to have into the future to decide on the operation.
[00:44:25.983 --> 00:44:27.984]  We're going to have to stay the same size or contract.
[00:44:28.305 --> 00:44:29.725]  I don't want to contract to the face of the enemy.
[00:44:29.806 --> 00:44:30.466]  I want to expand.
[00:44:30.486 --> 00:44:33.208]  So your prayers, your word of mouth is for all of us.
[00:44:33.228 --> 00:44:34.349]  And I thank you and I salute you.
[00:44:34.649 --> 00:44:35.930]  But go to InfoWareStore.com.
[00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.291]  We've got the sale extended to the weekend.
[00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:39.132]  And I don't even know what the new sale is going to be.
[00:44:39.152 --> 00:44:40.973]  We're just under such such siege here.
[00:44:40.993 --> 00:44:42.274]  But because of you, we're still in the fight.
[00:44:42.674 --> 00:44:46.809]  So go buy products at InfoWareStore.com and keep us all in the fight for your future and our future together.
[00:44:48.695 --> 00:44:52.077]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[00:44:52.097 --> 00:44:53.257]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:44:53.277 --> 00:44:54.838]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[00:44:55.018 --> 00:44:56.399]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[00:44:56.499 --> 00:44:57.519]  I want them shut down.
[00:44:57.579 --> 00:44:58.500]  I want them silenced.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.220]  I want them muted.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.161]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:45:01.181 --> 00:45:02.122]  You kept us on air.
[00:45:02.242 --> 00:45:03.562]  We did the analysis first.
[00:45:03.802 --> 00:45:04.823]  It's now gone mainstream.
[00:45:04.883 --> 00:45:06.684]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[00:45:06.964 --> 00:45:12.847]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[00:45:13.427 --> 00:45:14.509]  You need to stop right now.
[00:45:14.609 --> 00:45:15.670]  And they're very, very serious.
[00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:18.174]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[00:45:18.214 --> 00:45:19.136]  This is not going to happen.
[00:45:19.156 --> 00:45:21.059]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[00:45:21.519 --> 00:45:23.963]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[00:45:24.043 --> 00:45:25.706]  Save yourself, save the world.
[00:45:26.006 --> 00:45:26.868]  We're in this together.
[00:45:26.888 --> 00:45:27.989]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:29.591]  Communism's up here.
[00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:32.752]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[00:45:33.153 --> 00:45:34.954]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:45:35.174 --> 00:45:36.715]  My children are right here!
[00:45:37.455 --> 00:45:39.216]  But I need money to fight a war!
[00:45:39.396 --> 00:45:40.457]  And I need word of mouth!
[00:45:40.657 --> 00:45:41.577]  And I need prayer!
[00:45:41.718 --> 00:45:42.678]  And I need action!
[00:45:43.038 --> 00:45:44.639]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.321]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[00:45:47.981 --> 00:45:50.763]  Got a big next two hours for you left.
[00:45:51.789 --> 00:45:53.812]  I hope the phones up cover a ton of critical news.
[00:45:54.613 --> 00:45:59.079]  Tucker Carlson had a salon owner on last night who really exposed the fraud of Nancy Pelosi.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.745]  All these Democrats have been caught out not wearing their mask in restaurants because they know it's all a fraud.
[00:46:03.785 --> 00:46:05.808]  It's about dominating and controlling you.
[00:46:05.868 --> 00:46:07.210]  It's not about them being controlled.
[00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.771]  Here it is.
[00:46:09.209 --> 00:46:12.070]  Tonight we want to introduce you to the woman Nancy Pelosi is blaming.
[00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:16.771]  Erika Kayess owns the now famous salon in San Francisco and she joins us tonight.
[00:46:16.811 --> 00:46:18.431]  Erika, thanks so much for coming on.
[00:46:18.891 --> 00:46:20.051]  Thank you so much for having me.
[00:46:20.671 --> 00:46:28.793]  Nancy Pelosi claims on camera that you orchestrated a quote set up to entrap her into getting her hair blown out without a mask.
[00:46:29.193 --> 00:46:29.573]  Did you?
[00:46:30.334 --> 00:46:30.574]  No.
[00:46:31.354 --> 00:46:32.014]  Absolutely not.
[00:46:33.733 --> 00:46:35.455]  How would you have done that?
[00:46:35.675 --> 00:46:44.202]  I mean, can you prove that this wasn't a diabolical setup designed to bring down the Speaker of the House by blow-drying her hair?
[00:46:44.923 --> 00:46:48.586]  She had called the stylist, or her assistant did, and made the appointment.
[00:46:48.746 --> 00:46:51.108]  So, the appointment was already booked.
[00:46:51.628 --> 00:46:53.510]  So there's no way I could have set that up.
[00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.432]  And I've had a camera system in there for five years.
[00:46:56.633 --> 00:47:01.417]  I mean, I didn't go in there and turn cameras on as soon as she walked in to set her up.
[00:47:02.196 --> 00:47:03.297]  So that's absolutely false.
[00:47:04.017 --> 00:47:17.448]  So Pelosi says that salons in San Francisco, and of course she lives there and she is the most powerful Democratic legislator in the world, but she says she understood that the restrictions allowed a one-on-one appointment in salons.
[00:47:17.748 --> 00:47:18.529]  What do you make of that?
[00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:29.378]  I heard that and I thought to myself, well, as a hairstylist, I see clients one-on-one, so that would mean I would be open.
[00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:35.517]  Right?
[00:47:35.677 --> 00:47:36.397]  Are you open?
[00:47:37.478 --> 00:47:37.638]  No.
[00:47:39.178 --> 00:47:40.919]  What is that doing to you and your business?
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.221]  For the past six months, we've, I mean, we're pretty much done.
[00:47:47.241 --> 00:47:53.724]  I mean, we've lost at least 60% of our clients.
[00:47:54.244 --> 00:47:55.825]  I've lost the majority of my staff.
[00:47:57.256 --> 00:48:01.359]  Um, so, you know, six months is a long time to be closed down.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.200]  Yeah.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.062]  No, it's, I mean, it's, it's too long.
[00:48:04.662 --> 00:48:06.604]  Uh, so your business has been destroyed by this.
[00:48:07.204 --> 00:48:17.813]  How do you, how do you feel about seeing the most powerful woman in America come into your salon in violation of the rules she supports, get caught and then blame you for it?
[00:48:19.494 --> 00:48:21.576]  To be honest, it was more hurtful.
[00:48:22.216 --> 00:48:25.379]  Um, she's been coming in for quite a while and,
[00:48:26.823 --> 00:48:32.124]  Just to see her come in and especially not wearing the mask, that's what really got to me.
[00:48:32.224 --> 00:48:34.705]  But, you know, this isn't even political.
[00:48:34.785 --> 00:48:36.045]  I mean, she's been coming in there.
[00:48:36.185 --> 00:48:42.067]  It's the fact that she actually came in and didn't have a mask on.
[00:48:42.167 --> 00:48:47.568]  And I just thought about, you know, my staff and people not being able to work and make money and provide for their families.
[00:48:47.668 --> 00:48:50.069]  And if she's in there comfortably,
[00:48:50.993 --> 00:48:54.555]  Without a mask and feeling safe, then why are we shut down?
[00:48:54.715 --> 00:48:56.897]  Why am I not able to have clients come in?
[00:48:56.917 --> 00:49:00.619]  So, it's been, it's been hard.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.242]  You're not making a political point, you're making a human point rooted in common sense.
[00:49:06.283 --> 00:49:08.984]  And what do you think, I don't know what the answer is, what do you think the answer is?
[00:49:09.044 --> 00:49:13.187]  Why can't, if Nancy Pelosi feels comfortable using your salon, why can't civilians use it?
[00:49:14.224 --> 00:49:14.744]  Exactly.
[00:49:14.884 --> 00:49:22.727]  And I'll be honest, in our area in San Francisco, I mean, we're obviously the last county or city to not open.
[00:49:24.288 --> 00:49:25.568]  We've been trying to figure that out.
[00:49:25.868 --> 00:49:35.472]  We've been asking ourselves these questions for six months, I mean, for the past, actually, four months, of why we are not reopened.
[00:49:36.512 --> 00:49:38.513]  And that's kind of a good question.
[00:49:38.553 --> 00:49:39.673]  We, again, don't know.
[00:49:41.465 --> 00:49:42.086]  What are you going to do?
[00:49:42.126 --> 00:49:44.188]  Are you going to stay in the city, do you think, in San Francisco?
[00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:47.771]  I don't think so.
[00:49:47.791 --> 00:49:53.777]  The hard part of all this is that I have been in that community for 12 years.
[00:49:55.536 --> 00:50:03.863]  And since this happened, I have received nothing but hate, text messages, death threats.
[00:50:04.683 --> 00:50:06.605]  They're going to burn my hair salon down.
[00:50:07.345 --> 00:50:11.869]  My Yelp page is just unbelievable with bad reviews.
[00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:17.192]  You know, that's really the moral of the story here, is that Pelosi blamed her.
[00:50:17.272 --> 00:50:18.093]  You know, here's the answer.
[00:50:18.633 --> 00:50:21.355]  Everybody should not be complying with this, and then they couldn't enforce it.
[00:50:21.995 --> 00:50:26.938]  Just like the mayor still says most of the parks are closed, everybody's just there, the cops are ignoring it, because it's crap.
[00:50:28.379 --> 00:50:32.861]  And they try to get, then, lifeguards to threaten people, and the police go tell them, you can't do that, you're not a sworn officer.
[00:50:33.382 --> 00:50:35.963]  Just stop complying with the globalist takeover.
[00:50:36.864 --> 00:50:38.445]  It's a chi-com-run operation.
[00:50:39.005 --> 00:50:40.106]  God almighty, people!
[00:50:42.563 --> 00:50:43.303]  It's Friday.
[00:50:43.323 --> 00:50:44.504]  We're into the second hour.
[00:50:44.524 --> 00:50:46.465]  59 days out from this election.
[00:50:47.006 --> 00:50:47.946]  It's September 4th.
[00:50:48.126 --> 00:50:49.027]  I am honored to be here.
[00:50:49.587 --> 00:50:55.030]  Wild horses and the hounds of hell couldn't drag me away from this fight.
[00:50:55.531 --> 00:50:57.112]  And I am so honored to be here with you.
[00:50:57.952 --> 00:50:59.133]  I'm loving every minute of it.
[00:51:00.073 --> 00:51:01.014]  We were born for this.
[00:51:02.998 --> 00:51:09.041]  Deep within the New World Order senses, they know they are defenseless if we take action and have God on our side.
[00:51:09.621 --> 00:51:15.263]  All right, if you just joined us, I know some stations carry the second and third and fourth hour, or vice versa.
[00:51:15.583 --> 00:51:16.624]  Some carry the first two hours.
[00:51:17.924 --> 00:51:18.924]  Incredible news!
[00:51:18.964 --> 00:51:21.685]  They tested all the Big Ten athletes, not just the football players.
[00:51:22.765 --> 00:51:27.627]  And out of thousands that they said had COVID, of course, as the tester, 90 plus percent.
[00:51:28.087 --> 00:51:29.247]  Notice, I just follow what they admit.
[00:51:29.287 --> 00:51:32.148]  First, it's 30 percent false positive, 40 percent, 50 percent.
[00:51:32.168 --> 00:51:33.288]  And then I did the numbers last week.
[00:51:33.308 --> 00:51:34.309]  It was like, that's over 90.
[00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:37.209]  New York Times admits over 90 percent false positives.
[00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.591]  And no illnesses, no hospitalizations.
[00:51:42.691 --> 00:51:44.211]  And they made the doctor retract.
[00:51:44.371 --> 00:51:45.952]  He just made it up that
[00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:49.180]  A bunch of the football players had heart inflammation.
[00:51:49.641 --> 00:51:53.123]  Just pulled it out of his rear end.
[00:51:55.545 --> 00:52:00.709]  He goes, oh, he said, I saw an article where China said they had some heart inflammation in some of the cases.
[00:52:03.711 --> 00:52:15.539]  You got somebody living in a toxic city who's 70 years old, and they're eating crap food in China and breathing all that smog, and then you test them with some Bill Gates-created test that was created at Wuhan.
[00:52:15.579 --> 00:52:16.640]  They have this whole thing set up.
[00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:21.911]  And then they go, Oh, this person has eyesight problem.
[00:52:22.011 --> 00:52:22.631]  It's COVID.
[00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:23.852]  This person has a brain problem.
[00:52:23.912 --> 00:52:24.392]  It's COVID.
[00:52:25.433 --> 00:52:30.617]  And they just attribute in the fear, everything under the sun and people get confused and they get scared.
[00:52:30.637 --> 00:52:37.842]  But what you need to know is in Hawaii, it's 0.0004 something.
[00:52:38.162 --> 00:52:42.445]  I mean, that means we're talking hundreds of times, not as bad as the flu.
[00:52:44.363 --> 00:52:47.184]  Remember just eight months ago, we're like, well, it looks like it's a bad flu.
[00:52:47.784 --> 00:52:54.126]  But they showed you the apocalyptic images and the wailing at night, like some zombie movie and people being welded into their homes.
[00:52:54.166 --> 00:52:59.448]  But a lot of the footage would show that a cameraman being waved in or a director, and it was being directed.
[00:53:00.849 --> 00:53:03.389]  He noticed the guys having bags put over their heads and drug away.
[00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:07.831]  Looks suspiciously like they were in too good a shape and everything, and they were police officers.
[00:53:09.568 --> 00:53:21.675]  So Communist China did a little Hollywood on us and did a big production to crack down on their own population to make us forget about Hong Kong, Taiwan, that have now taken over Hong Kong.
[00:53:22.655 --> 00:53:23.196]  Remember all that?
[00:53:23.296 --> 00:53:26.718]  That's all distant past and they've taken over and they're in charge now.
[00:53:28.759 --> 00:53:30.240]  And then the Clintons came out again.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.922]  Hillary last week, now Bill, said, you know, he's not planning to leave.
[00:53:33.962 --> 00:53:35.543]  We need the military to take him out of there.
[00:53:35.563 --> 00:53:39.045]  You know, we need to drag this out.
[00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:46.313]  He'll look like he wins big, but we're going to count every one of those ballots, 80 million of them, that are just being smelled out everywhere.
[00:53:47.373 --> 00:53:51.055]  We've got a big clip that the crew found, that Rob, one of the producers found, from 2008.
[00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:58.478]  Obama, when he wanted to sound reasonable, back when Biden was like, we're not coming after your rifles, your shotguns, your handguns, not your AR-15.
[00:53:58.678 --> 00:53:59.618]  That's a lie.
[00:53:59.979 --> 00:54:01.139]  Nobody wants your guns.
[00:54:01.279 --> 00:54:01.799]  Remember that?
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:02.840]  Nobody.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:09.783]  We're like, hey, the UN says, the Brady campaign says, they all say the goal is get registration and then confiscation.
[00:54:11.544 --> 00:54:17.389]  They want to track everything and then ban everything, and that's what the police state's about with the COVID tracing and the social credit score.
[00:54:17.409 --> 00:54:17.950]  It's all here.
[00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.490]  It ain't coming.
[00:54:19.791 --> 00:54:24.296]  You're not going to have to wait anymore for what I tell you to come true, and then, oh God, it did come true in five years.
[00:54:24.576 --> 00:54:26.578]  You're going to get a big old serving of it right now.
[00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:32.563]  And if you start complying with this because you're too afraid, well, you're going to start complying with everything.
[00:54:34.945 --> 00:54:37.868]  Because once they crowbar open the door, man, hell comes in.
[00:54:39.864 --> 00:54:52.174]  So here's the Clintonistas, last night, in one of their little Skype things, because, oh, you know, Zoom things, they can't, the COVID's so bad, that's why Biden's hiding, and that's why they're hiding, and just what a sick joke.
[00:54:52.474 --> 00:55:03.403]  Here is the child molester, devil worshiper couple, child trafficking, running Jeffrey Epstein, literal ghouls of hell, that still control.
[00:55:03.463 --> 00:55:04.364]  Look at Bill Clinton's eyes.
[00:55:05.728 --> 00:55:06.568]  He is so pissed.
[00:55:07.029 --> 00:55:07.949]  He is so scared.
[00:55:08.349 --> 00:55:09.190]  He is so bad.
[00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:11.291]  He has sucked the energy out of so many children.
[00:55:11.611 --> 00:55:12.431]  Sucked their dreams.
[00:55:12.511 --> 00:55:13.172]  Sucked their hope.
[00:55:13.512 --> 00:55:14.312]  Sucked their soul.
[00:55:14.693 --> 00:55:15.473]  Betrayed them.
[00:55:18.334 --> 00:55:18.995]  Look at those eyes.
[00:55:20.155 --> 00:55:21.096]  Run those sex ops.
[00:55:22.457 --> 00:55:23.737]  He's the guy that betrayed America.
[00:55:24.017 --> 00:55:24.758]  He's the enemy.
[00:55:24.998 --> 00:55:26.158]  He's the sack of garbage.
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.100]  Yeah, zoom in on those eyes even more.
[00:55:30.141 --> 00:55:30.781]  Look at those eyes.
[00:55:32.915 --> 00:55:38.573]  And they've got Atlantic Monthly going, President Trump behind closed doors says he hates the military and they're losers.
[00:55:43.763 --> 00:55:46.685]  But see, that's Bill Clinton when he's being the fake, oh, I'm Bill Clinton.
[00:55:47.146 --> 00:55:52.270]  When you go back to the other shot of his eyes, look at the hate and the venom and the will.
[00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.671]  He loves to rape women and children.
[00:55:54.711 --> 00:55:56.092]  He loves to beat people up.
[00:55:56.453 --> 00:55:57.934]  He loves to make people sad.
[00:55:58.474 --> 00:56:04.899]  And he loves to then do it right in a coat room or right in a bathroom next to a big dinner party or a big reception.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:08.022]  He'll say, hey, so you're the manager here in town, huh?
[00:56:09.346 --> 00:56:10.991]  You're the Republican Party chairlady.
[00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:11.552]  Well, you're nice.
[00:56:11.593 --> 00:56:14.742]  Let me show you some stuff over here in the side office.
[00:56:15.323 --> 00:56:16.868]  And then he grabs him by the hair and he goes, listen.
[00:56:17.887 --> 00:56:19.888]  I'm going to rape you and if you say anything they're not going to believe it.
[00:56:19.908 --> 00:56:20.868]  You're going to lose your whole life.
[00:56:21.408 --> 00:56:22.048]  And they're like, what?
[00:56:22.128 --> 00:56:23.429]  He goes, let me just kiss you.
[00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:27.570]  And he bites their lower lip so hard, blood starts dripping.
[00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:34.152]  And then while he's holding on like a snapping turtle, he, he, he, he tears their panties off.
[00:56:34.492 --> 00:56:38.913]  And then with his big crooked proboscis, rapes them.
[00:56:38.973 --> 00:56:40.993]  Reportedly he goes this and turns, I'm not trying to be gross here.
[00:56:41.173 --> 00:56:42.794]  It's like the women all described the same deal.
[00:56:44.056 --> 00:56:47.138]  And then he just sits there while he flobbers on the woman, raping her.
[00:56:47.718 --> 00:56:49.860]  That's who these people are.
[00:56:51.461 --> 00:56:55.143]  That's a spiritual thing, to rape a woman like that, or rape a child like that.
[00:56:55.563 --> 00:56:56.404]  It's hurting them.
[00:56:56.744 --> 00:56:57.685]  It's abusing them.
[00:56:57.905 --> 00:56:58.946]  It's making them desperate.
[00:56:59.186 --> 00:57:00.206]  It's horrifying them.
[00:57:00.487 --> 00:57:05.590]  It's taking someone that admires you, and betraying them!
[00:57:07.771 --> 00:57:09.933]  It's the same energy from a woman that admires you.
[00:57:12.034 --> 00:57:13.315]  Or a child that trusts you.
[00:57:14.403 --> 00:57:15.604]  It's about betrayal.
[00:57:16.824 --> 00:57:21.067]  It's about the thing in him wants to betray innocence.
[00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:31.312]  And are you gonna let that thing and his droppings like Brian Stelter rule you?
[00:57:31.692 --> 00:57:31.932]  No!
[00:57:32.132 --> 00:57:33.333]  You do not rule my soul!
[00:57:33.573 --> 00:57:34.173]  God does!
[00:57:34.454 --> 00:57:35.574]  You will burn in hell!
[00:57:35.874 --> 00:57:36.655]  You already are!
[00:57:36.675 --> 00:57:39.016]  Into the pit from which you came!
[00:57:39.276 --> 00:57:40.217]  Get behind me, Satan!
[00:57:41.938 --> 00:57:42.538]  So here's a...
[00:57:44.462 --> 00:57:45.222]  Here's Bill Clinton.
[00:57:46.603 --> 00:57:48.244]  Oh yeah, Trump's not going to leave.
[00:57:48.884 --> 00:57:54.727]  And then here's what old Obama, because they're on the news saying, there's no election fraud, there's no voter fraud, there's no problem.
[00:57:55.007 --> 00:57:56.367]  Here is Bill Clinton.
[00:57:57.928 --> 00:57:59.969]  And we're going to get our country back.
[00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:00.829]  That's our plan.
[00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:02.630]  President Clinton just left.
[00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:03.691]  Can you imagine?
[00:58:03.751 --> 00:58:05.111]  And I say this all the time.
[00:58:05.191 --> 00:58:06.212]  I got in trouble again on CNN.
[00:58:06.292 --> 00:58:09.533]  I said, there's going to be a split screen on January 20th at 12 noon, 2021.
[00:58:13.255 --> 00:58:19.080]  Joe Biden is going to be accepting, or doing the inauguration, what is it?
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:21.341]  Giving the oath.
[00:58:21.842 --> 00:58:23.683]  Yes, that thing that y'all been through twice.
[00:58:25.304 --> 00:58:27.786]  He's going to be doing that, and there's going to be a split screen.
[00:58:27.826 --> 00:58:34.031]  You're going to see the military going in to pull this man who's going to white knuckle, no, orange knuckle the president of death.
[00:58:34.552 --> 00:58:35.672]  President Clinton, I just love you!
[00:58:38.394 --> 00:58:42.696]  Well, no, I was just thinking, you know, he probably won't even come to Biden's inauguration.
[00:58:42.736 --> 00:58:44.937]  He'd be sack and sandbag in front of what else?
[00:58:46.317 --> 00:58:47.098]  I want to be honest.
[00:58:47.578 --> 00:58:52.400]  It's not as if it's just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.760]  Sometimes Democrats have to.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:59:07.886]  We've got to have a, I believe, a voting rights division in the Justice Department that is nonpartisan and that is serious about
[00:59:08.587 --> 00:59:11.028]  You know, investigating cases of vote fraud.
[00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:15.131]  So now Democrats want you to believe, though, that none of that exists.
[00:59:15.171 --> 00:59:19.153]  See the video of them at newswars.com, infowars.com, and more.
[00:59:19.173 --> 00:59:20.774]  And that's how these articles and videos get out.
[00:59:21.134 --> 00:59:23.015]  You know what's going on, but your friends and family may not.
[00:59:23.355 --> 00:59:25.476]  That's how you give them the gift of truth every day in this fight.
[00:59:25.857 --> 00:59:28.538]  Big Tech wants to suppress you, they want to suppress me, they want to silence us?
[00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:36.883]  Well, they can't silence us physically when there's websites and independent news organizations outside of their control fighting as hard as we can to stay on air.
[00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:41.656]  So those of you that support us with your word of mouth, your financial support, you're awesome.
[00:59:41.696 --> 00:59:42.096]  Thank you.
[00:59:42.116 --> 00:59:43.137]  And your prayer is amazing.
[00:59:44.038 --> 00:59:48.862]  The final piece of the equation is the promotion of what you've supported and what you built.
[00:59:49.262 --> 00:59:50.643]  InfoWars is yours.
[00:59:52.044 --> 00:59:52.585]  I am yours.
[00:59:53.585 --> 00:59:56.788]  And I pledge to you 110% commitment.
[00:59:57.329 --> 01:00:03.854]  You have my total commitment unto death, unto absolute nothing, not my, nothing, nothing stands in the way of this.
[01:00:04.294 --> 01:00:05.295]  You have my pledge.
[01:00:05.515 --> 01:00:06.616]  I pledge allegiance to you.
[01:00:06.956 --> 01:00:07.357]  Stay with us.
[01:00:09.764 --> 01:00:11.885]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:00:11.985 --> 01:00:13.666]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:13.686 --> 01:00:15.728]  All right, here's what I want to do.
[01:00:15.788 --> 01:00:19.590]  I want to open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast.
[01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:28.555]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see footage that we're going to be showing coming up next segment that a journalist that got into the Antifa military training camp.
[01:00:28.615 --> 01:00:30.957]  Now, this isn't a chop area.
[01:00:30.977 --> 01:00:34.419]  This isn't some fake autonomous zone that the city let them set up.
[01:00:34.439 --> 01:00:35.579]  This is where they're actually training.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.141]  And in Seattle,
[01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:44.851]  In 1999, the city under Bill Clinton actually housed Antifa.
[01:00:46.231 --> 01:00:48.092]  And at that point, the U.S.
[01:00:48.152 --> 01:00:54.434]  military was ordered to aid Antifa to set up the prototype of this.
[01:00:54.454 --> 01:00:56.035]  And I can tell you, the military did not like it.
[01:00:56.435 --> 01:00:59.596]  But it was the Delta Force was ordered to do this.
[01:01:01.096 --> 01:01:01.897]  And I'm not joking.
[01:01:02.437 --> 01:01:03.277]  We were told about it at the time.
[01:01:03.297 --> 01:01:08.619]  About a year later, it came out in the major Seattle Post-Intelligencer that Bill Clinton ordered Delta Force to help
[01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:14.982]  Fund Antifa to then discredit the peaceful rioters.
[01:01:15.682 --> 01:01:17.483]  I'm being a Freudian slip joke there.
[01:01:18.443 --> 01:01:21.384]  The people that were peaceful at the time, so they could say that they were rioters.
[01:01:21.404 --> 01:01:33.947]  So you have to understand, Antifa is provocateurs of the Clintons and of the Deep State, and they've been dumb enough now to try to use it against the American people with their so-called fiery but mostly peaceful events.
[01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:38.868]  And again, I'm being sarcastic, quoting CNN, so that's coming up next segment.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.141]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[01:01:47.943 --> 01:01:49.204]  It's 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 or 877-789-ALEX.
[01:01:49.224 --> 01:02:05.256]  And if you're in a country that doesn't let you or have a phone that doesn't let you call 1-800 number, you can dial the country access code at 512-646-1776.
[01:02:06.257 --> 01:02:10.700]  First-time callers, long-time callers, if you agree, you disagree, it's a free-for-all.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.641]  We don't screen your calls.
[01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:13.703]  Just that you have a good phone line.
[01:02:14.616 --> 01:02:15.476]  You be ready to talk.
[01:02:16.076 --> 01:02:17.717]  And if you want to tell us how you're listening, that's fine.
[01:02:17.737 --> 01:02:21.098]  Or you want to tell us you disagree, I'll tend to put you towards the head of the line.
[01:02:22.539 --> 01:02:24.719]  But we don't screen the calls.
[01:02:24.759 --> 01:02:28.361]  You know, there's a big leftist lie out there that we have fake callers.
[01:02:28.421 --> 01:02:31.862]  Well, call in and experience it for yourself.
[01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:42.345]  We also have been harassed so badly that the Democrats put out news articles last year that we have fake reviews at Infowarshore.com.
[01:02:42.705 --> 01:02:43.926]  Of course, it's not fake reviews.
[01:02:45.051 --> 01:02:47.693]  It's Power Reviews, one of the most highly respected review groups out there.
[01:02:49.174 --> 01:02:54.198]  But I can tell you that that information got investigated by the feds.
[01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:59.582]  So that's the level we're under where the Democrats say we have fake reviews and fake callers.
[01:02:59.662 --> 01:03:00.243]  None of it's true.
[01:03:01.732 --> 01:03:04.334]  But they want us to be the criminals like they are when we're not.
[01:03:04.394 --> 01:03:07.015]  We're not child molester devil worshipers like you.
[01:03:07.495 --> 01:03:08.196]  We built the country.
[01:03:08.216 --> 01:03:09.216]  We're not trash like you.
[01:03:09.637 --> 01:03:10.677]  And we're taking the trash out.
[01:03:11.378 --> 01:03:15.180]  So, 877-789-2539, and we'll take your phone calls.
[01:03:16.761 --> 01:03:26.487]  Pretty amazing footage we just showed of Obama, if you joined us, admitting that, indeed, there's election fraud on both sides.
[01:03:26.507 --> 01:03:29.509]  Well, the Democrats are the ones that are known for that.
[01:03:30.691 --> 01:03:34.412]  I mean, you've got to say, it's like 50 to 1 stories about Democrats caught doing it.
[01:03:34.432 --> 01:03:37.973]  I mean, I can't really think of cases where Republicans have been caught doing it.
[01:03:39.613 --> 01:03:44.814]  I mean, the Democrats have been known as the dirty, nasty party that the Republicans are intimidated by forever.
[01:03:45.374 --> 01:03:46.335]  They're the original party.
[01:03:47.195 --> 01:03:50.096]  And up front, Thomas Jefferson got upset with them and he founded them.
[01:03:50.696 --> 01:03:52.276]  And George Washington thought they were criminals.
[01:03:54.777 --> 01:03:57.757]  The Republicans came along to challenge him and they had a civil war over it.
[01:04:01.783 --> 01:04:11.128]  We're here again and you heard the antifa scumbag whose sister said that he wasn't in the military and it wasn't bad news, he was dead.
[01:04:12.389 --> 01:04:12.949]  He's a liar.
[01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:17.152]  He's on video executing the poor man last weekend.
[01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:28.378]  And then he reportedly pulled a gun on a federal task force and got killed.
[01:04:30.486 --> 01:04:33.587]  And the media's saying, oh, he's probably, they just executed him in cold blood.
[01:04:33.607 --> 01:04:34.067]  Yeah, right.
[01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.469]  Yeah, right.
[01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:40.610]  The guy is a scumbag and he's dead.
[01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:42.311]  And he looks like all of them.
[01:04:42.351 --> 01:04:45.092]  He looks like a glow-in-the-dark meth head pedophile.
[01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:47.230]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:49.751]  I'm saying he looks like a pedophile.
[01:04:50.291 --> 01:04:54.292]  Just like the guy that started the attack on Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:04:54.312 --> 01:04:56.352]  They're now reporting was chasing him saying kill him.
[01:04:56.752 --> 01:04:59.233]  And even the New York Times admits on video there's a shot fired.
[01:04:59.573 --> 01:05:01.673]  They're not sure by who at Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:05:01.953 --> 01:05:07.934]  And that then the convicted pedophile who kidnapped and raped nine-year-old boys.
[01:05:07.954 --> 01:05:08.774]  We now know the details.
[01:05:09.935 --> 01:05:11.995]  They reportedly had other victims even younger.
[01:05:15.168 --> 01:05:19.290]  He was trying to take his gun when he got killed, just like the other two guys that got shot.
[01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:23.833]  One guy had a pistol extended at him, and he was nice enough to just shoot him in the arm!
[01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:26.494]  Talk about cool under pressure.
[01:05:26.774 --> 01:05:29.456]  You got a gun extended at me, over me, you've been chasing me?
[01:05:29.976 --> 01:05:31.297]  You're gonna get one right in the chest.
[01:05:31.997 --> 01:05:32.757]  Or right in the head.
[01:05:35.058 --> 01:05:39.461]  But Rittenhouse, I guess as a humanitarian,
[01:05:41.149 --> 01:05:43.951]  And did not shoot the guy dead center in the chest.
[01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:49.074]  And so the guy that survived said, my only regret was I was unable to pull the trigger and kill him.
[01:05:49.734 --> 01:05:50.454]  I was trying to.
[01:05:50.594 --> 01:05:56.198]  He was quoted at the hospital with a photo of him with his buddy saying, my only regret is I didn't get him dead yet.
[01:05:57.258 --> 01:05:58.339]  I sure tried to kill him.
[01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:02.121]  Chasing you down, confessing you want to kill somebody.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.185]  And Rittenhouse is in a jail cell right now with Antifa on the internet, offering rewards for whoever in the jail will kill him.
[01:06:12.505 --> 01:06:12.926]  You know what?
[01:06:13.026 --> 01:06:15.688]  I got a feeling that nobody's gonna be killing Rittenhouse in jail.
[01:06:16.608 --> 01:06:18.089]  People don't like folks like you.
[01:06:18.389 --> 01:06:24.374]  You know, criminals that get busted for dealing drugs, had to make money, I'm not defending it, or somebody that got in trouble, you know, for doing something.
[01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:26.035]  They don't like child molesters.
[01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:28.056]  They don't like devil worshipers.
[01:06:28.076 --> 01:06:29.938]  And everybody knows who Antifa is.
[01:06:29.978 --> 01:06:32.479]  They're devil-worshiping meth-head Satanists.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:33.400]  And they're 90% white.
[01:06:36.112 --> 01:06:38.655]  About 8% Hispanic and about 2% Black.
[01:06:39.355 --> 01:06:48.805]  I mean, the whitest thing you'll ever be to, we've infiltrated them here in Austin and covered them in other areas of the country, the whitest thing you'll ever go to is an Antifa meeting.
[01:06:50.376 --> 01:06:52.857]  And it looks like a convention of white ghouls.
[01:06:53.317 --> 01:07:07.823]  There'll usually be a super obese black woman there who hates men, an obese lesbian Marxist who'll usually be the semi-commander, and then there'll usually be a crazy Chinese agent, a young woman, who'll just hate in her eyes.
[01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:13.505]  And then you go to the meetings, we've got undercover video, we've shown them here, we've confronted them, you've seen them, you've seen them.
[01:07:14.585 --> 01:07:24.168]  And then there'll also be a bunch of basement-dwelling, you know, super obese gay white dudes who will actually wear mal outfits.
[01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:31.031]  I mean, there's something about a 400-pound gay dude in a mal outfit dreaming of how he's going to put people in FEMA camps and kill them.
[01:07:33.134 --> 01:07:46.139]  And you see them out in public when we're out there, we gotta be in armored vehicles, they'll attack, and just like, these glow-in-the-dark, weirdo, crazy people, you didn't even know existed, just boil out, and they're like, they're the droppings of George Soros.
[01:07:46.659 --> 01:07:47.999]  They're the children of George Soros.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:57.163]  And they're just these totally fake, virtue-signaling, lying, scum, everything that comes out of their mouth is a giant, filthy lie.
[01:07:58.882 --> 01:08:00.483]  They got a bunch of new fake news out on Trump.
[01:08:00.503 --> 01:08:06.907]  We'll tell you about it, go to your phone calls, and show you the secret Antifa camp paid for by a major Democrat city straight ahead.
[01:08:06.947 --> 01:08:07.767]  Tell folks to tune in.
[01:08:07.987 --> 01:08:10.149]  That really pisses off George Soros.
[01:08:10.889 --> 01:08:13.671]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones on this live Friday edition.
[01:08:15.712 --> 01:08:26.519]  Well, Democrat leader in the House, Jerry the Penguin Nadler, said there's no such thing as Antifa a month ago.
[01:08:26.539 --> 01:08:26.899]  Remember this?
[01:08:29.172 --> 01:08:30.112]  Violence across the whole country.
[01:08:30.132 --> 01:08:31.573]  Do you disavow the violence from Antifa?
[01:08:32.493 --> 01:08:34.273]  That's happening in Portland right now?
[01:08:34.373 --> 01:08:38.074]  That's a myth that's being spread only in Washington, D.C.
[01:08:38.174 --> 01:08:39.474]  About Antifa in Portland?
[01:08:39.574 --> 01:08:39.854]  Yes.
[01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:41.855]  Sure, there's videos everywhere online.
[01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:43.115]  There's fires and riots.
[01:08:43.135 --> 01:08:46.536]  They're throwing fireworks at federal officers.
[01:08:46.596 --> 01:08:47.476]  DHS is there.
[01:08:48.136 --> 01:08:48.836]  Look online.
[01:08:49.156 --> 01:08:50.597]  It gets crazy, Mr. Nadler.
[01:08:55.058 --> 01:08:56.898]  There goes Mayor Cobblebot.
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.941]  Now, let's look at these articles.
[01:09:00.021 --> 01:09:02.663]  Big video, big article we're going to be getting to in a moment.
[01:09:02.723 --> 01:09:11.408]  Portland's Antifa war camp was really just set up to house homeless during COVID-19, they claim, the post-millennial reports.
[01:09:11.428 --> 01:09:13.349]  Incredible video, incredible photos.
[01:09:15.131 --> 01:09:26.518]  Inside, what's described as an armed camp with a bunch of drug addicts, scum, and child molesters wandering around, acting tough, and telling everybody how they were in the military.
[01:09:27.813 --> 01:09:31.496]  Meanwhile, Oregon Church hosting Antifa summer camp for children.
[01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:32.337]  And guess what?
[01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:33.398]  No one's wearing masks.
[01:09:33.438 --> 01:09:35.000]  They all know it's a hoax.
[01:09:35.961 --> 01:09:40.525]  Speaking of that, former Australian Prime Minister slams health dictatorship.
[01:09:42.847 --> 01:10:02.871]  Tony Abbott, after the country's now officially in a recession, the former Australian Prime Minister, warned today in a speech to the UK think tank PolicyChange that the virus hysteria, and that's what it is, it's the great virus panic, and draconian lockdowns are perpetuating the economic slowdown and have created something-for-nothing mindset.
[01:10:02.911 --> 01:10:05.612]  Yeah, people are getting lazier and lazier and don't want to go back to work.
[01:10:05.632 --> 01:10:06.912]  That's why factories can't get going.
[01:10:07.332 --> 01:10:09.073]  They go, oh, I heard there's COVID, I'm not going.
[01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:10.453]  And the government's like, oh, here's more money.
[01:10:11.053 --> 01:10:13.174]  Among younger generations living on furlough.
[01:10:14.634 --> 01:10:17.556]  We'll get more of this after we take some calls.
[01:10:17.576 --> 01:10:18.236]  But here's video.
[01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:19.576]  This is all on Infowars.com.
[01:10:19.896 --> 01:10:23.318]  The article about the Australian Prime Minister saying this is a health dictatorship.
[01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:24.558]  Yeah, it's a medical tyranny.
[01:10:24.578 --> 01:10:25.159]  That's what I call it.
[01:10:26.339 --> 01:10:30.761]  UK transport police manhandle pepper spray train passenger for not wearing mask.
[01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:32.381]  It's all about virtue signaling.
[01:10:32.401 --> 01:10:33.042]  They're being told.
[01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:37.783]  If it's a communist meeting, an Islamic meeting, you know Muslims are kidnapping little girls and sex slaving them.
[01:10:38.104 --> 01:10:38.964]  Don't you touch them.
[01:10:40.333 --> 01:10:43.518]  But if somebody isn't wearing a mask and is white, beat the hell out of them.
[01:10:44.199 --> 01:10:46.764]  It's about driving the indigenous population into submission.
[01:10:47.365 --> 01:10:47.886]  Here's the video.
[01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:52.173]  Underlying health conditions.
[01:10:52.193 --> 01:10:53.194]  You don't have to wear a mask.
[01:10:53.294 --> 01:10:54.334]  Underlying health conditions.
[01:10:54.354 --> 01:10:56.095]  I do not have to wear a mask.
[01:10:56.255 --> 01:10:56.735]  End of.
[01:10:56.835 --> 01:10:58.656]  And you do not have to challenge me either.
[01:10:58.756 --> 01:11:00.717]  It's against the law to challenge me.
[01:11:01.097 --> 01:11:04.379]  It's against the law to challenge me as well.
[01:11:04.419 --> 01:11:05.719]  I'm not getting off.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:06.460]  Get off!
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.761]  Who the f*** do you think you're grabbing?
[01:11:09.381 --> 01:11:10.862]  Who the f*** do you think you're grabbing?
[01:11:11.998 --> 01:11:14.859]  Who the f*** are you grabbing?
[01:11:15.199 --> 01:11:16.659]  Get off me!
[01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:18.319]  I've told you, no!
[01:11:18.739 --> 01:11:19.319]  Now get off me!
[01:11:19.339 --> 01:11:19.960]  Now get off me!
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.800]  Now you've been told.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.940]  Get the f*** off!
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.801]  It's all because of Brexit, all because of Trump.
[01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:28.541]  And it's going to blow up in their face.
[01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:30.521]  He hasn't done nothing wrong!
[01:11:30.581 --> 01:11:32.722]  He hasn't done nothing wrong!
[01:11:32.782 --> 01:11:33.822]  He's done nothing wrong!
[01:11:33.842 --> 01:11:34.962]  Get off me!
[01:11:34.982 --> 01:11:35.882]  Medical conditions!
[01:11:35.922 --> 01:11:36.803]  Medical conditions!
[01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:42.765]  I need to speak to you, I'll speak to you.
[01:11:42.805 --> 01:11:49.487]  Get out of my medical condition!
[01:11:49.527 --> 01:11:50.488]  This is bad cops.
[01:11:50.508 --> 01:11:52.348]  This is what leftists is.
[01:11:52.649 --> 01:11:54.509]  You want to live in a police state, live under liberals.
[01:11:54.529 --> 01:11:56.490]  They all want to rape your privacy.
[01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:58.351]  They all want to rape your innocence.
[01:11:58.371 --> 01:11:59.791]  They all want to rape your medical health.
[01:11:59.811 --> 01:12:00.332]  They're evil.
[01:12:00.352 --> 01:12:00.872]  They're not liberals.
[01:12:00.892 --> 01:12:01.612]  They're leftists.
[01:12:01.712 --> 01:12:04.173]  You're on a power trip here.
[01:12:08.815 --> 01:12:09.495]  Yeah!
[01:12:09.515 --> 01:12:11.055]  You're the one on the power trip!
[01:12:11.196 --> 01:12:13.816]  And I voted to vote in and told you I don't have to f***ing wear one!
[01:12:13.836 --> 01:12:14.216]  Let go of me!
[01:12:14.236 --> 01:12:14.556]  Let go of me!
[01:12:14.576 --> 01:12:15.096]  Let go of me!
[01:12:15.116 --> 01:12:15.836]  You're the one on him!
[01:12:15.856 --> 01:12:16.537]  Let go of me!
[01:12:16.557 --> 01:12:16.857]  You're the one!
[01:12:16.877 --> 01:12:17.397]  You're the f***ing bully!
[01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:18.357]  I told you I don't have to f***ing wear one!
[01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:18.677]  Let go of me!
[01:12:18.697 --> 01:12:19.457]  You're the one on him!
[01:12:19.717 --> 01:12:20.197]  Let go of me!
[01:12:20.217 --> 01:12:20.857]  You're the one!
[01:12:20.897 --> 01:12:21.758]  You're the f***ing bully!
[01:12:21.778 --> 01:12:23.838]  I told you I don't have to f***ing wear one!
[01:12:23.858 --> 01:12:24.158]  Let go of me!
[01:12:24.178 --> 01:12:25.078]  You're the f***ing bully!
[01:12:25.098 --> 01:12:26.539]  I told you I don't have to f***ing wear one!
[01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:26.859]  Let go of me!
[01:12:26.879 --> 01:12:27.419]  You're the f***ing bully!
[01:12:27.439 --> 01:12:29.099]  I told you I don't have to f***ing wear one!
[01:12:29.119 --> 01:12:29.499]  Let go of me!
[01:12:29.539 --> 01:12:30.359]  You're the f***ing bully!
[01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:31.860]  I told you I don't have to f***ing wear one!
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.260]  Let go of me!
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.160]  You're the f***ing bully!
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:33.340]  I
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:37.082]  Tens of millions starving to death.
[01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:41.385]  The cop's the hero, keeping you in martial law.
[01:12:42.105 --> 01:12:42.926]  Keeping you in lockdown.
[01:12:45.187 --> 01:12:45.967]  And you know what they're going to do?
[01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:46.988]  They're going to throw the book at that guy.
[01:12:47.028 --> 01:12:48.189]  He'll spend 10 years in prison.
[01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:51.951]  But if he was caught with little girls he's raping well, he's part of the team.
[01:12:53.112 --> 01:12:55.013]  And the UK police are the problem.
[01:12:55.373 --> 01:12:56.634]  They are bad news, man.
[01:12:58.786 --> 01:13:00.247]  At least in London, the places I've been.
[01:13:00.287 --> 01:13:01.509]  I mean, it's like, wow.
[01:13:01.609 --> 01:13:03.851]  They literally hate the population.
[01:13:04.071 --> 01:13:04.992]  They hate their people.
[01:13:05.232 --> 01:13:07.314]  They hate their country's existence because they're traitors.
[01:13:07.694 --> 01:13:09.716]  They're hired by globalists to end their country.
[01:13:11.158 --> 01:13:12.079]  They need to be repudiated.
[01:13:12.819 --> 01:13:13.440]  Disgusting.
[01:13:16.482 --> 01:13:19.004]  Now the converse of that is most police you run into in the U.S.
[01:13:19.064 --> 01:13:21.906]  are the most awake about the mask being a fraud because they can go read statistics.
[01:13:22.507 --> 01:13:26.970]  And they understand that there is loopholes if you have a health condition and they're not even supposed to be able to ask you.
[01:13:27.371 --> 01:13:27.991]  Because the U.N.
[01:13:28.031 --> 01:13:29.512]  wrote the rules because they want a waiver.
[01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:31.053]  But they don't want us knowing about it.
[01:13:32.094 --> 01:13:33.976]  So the law itself is a fraud and should be resisted.
[01:13:35.157 --> 01:13:37.478]  But when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:13:37.498 --> 01:13:39.360]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.303]  If you don't want to live under that, go live in North Korea.
[01:13:44.444 --> 01:13:45.745]  But we live here in America.
[01:13:49.206 --> 01:13:52.428]  We'll get to the end of a war camp next hour, because I want to start getting to your calls now.
[01:13:53.088 --> 01:14:03.693]  The video's up on InfoWars.com, but again, you heard Nadler, and he can barely walk and barely stand up and doesn't even know who he is, but he's corrupt and evil and works for the Tycoms, so he just says it doesn't exist.
[01:14:03.713 --> 01:14:05.374]  It's all about disdain to you.
[01:14:06.434 --> 01:14:08.996]  You're like, hey, we don't like evicted pedophiles having drag queen story time.
[01:14:09.396 --> 01:14:10.156]  Oh, that doesn't exist.
[01:14:10.897 --> 01:14:14.558]  Hey, we don't like the border being wide open and 1.4 million deaths from TB last year.
[01:14:14.779 --> 01:14:15.439]  That doesn't exist.
[01:14:17.248 --> 01:14:21.671]  We don't like you doing all these horrible things to our sovereignty and selling us out.
[01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:24.232]  It's always the disrespect of not even having a debate.
[01:14:25.113 --> 01:14:26.133]  Because you don't exist.
[01:14:26.354 --> 01:14:26.974]  You don't exist.
[01:14:27.074 --> 01:14:27.935]  We don't respond to you.
[01:14:27.995 --> 01:14:28.795]  We don't talk to you.
[01:14:29.375 --> 01:14:32.878]  But CNN says they're the victim of censorship because they didn't get the first debate.
[01:14:33.438 --> 01:14:37.320]  That Trump's in a war against the media by criticizing these lying sacks of garbage.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:41.803]  When it's Oliver Darcy and other pieces of filth like him that go around running all the censorship.
[01:14:42.303 --> 01:14:43.404]  That's the face of the enemy.
[01:14:43.444 --> 01:14:44.965]  The bottom of the barrel had to dredge up.
[01:14:46.485 --> 01:14:55.531]  Okay, we're gonna go to Blake, and Presley, and Jeff, and Cece, and Black Lightning, and Jacqueline, and Annie, and Steve, and Paul, and everybody else.
[01:14:56.452 --> 01:14:58.934]  So let's go to a caller in Virginia first.
[01:14:59.734 --> 01:15:02.736]  Let's go to Jacqueline in Virginia.
[01:15:02.796 --> 01:15:03.437]  Thanks for calling.
[01:15:05.838 --> 01:15:06.259]  Hello.
[01:15:06.639 --> 01:15:06.959]  Welcome.
[01:15:06.999 --> 01:15:07.560]  Thanks for calling.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:08.960]  You're welcome.
[01:15:09.021 --> 01:15:09.661]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:10.922]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:15:10.962 --> 01:15:13.103]  My son adores you, so I just want to let you know.
[01:15:14.386 --> 01:15:24.512]  I just wanted to call to say about these rioting BLMs and these crazy folks out in Portland and wherever else they're out there rioting, looting, and acting a fool.
[01:15:25.273 --> 01:15:35.199]  I think that they should take them and just put them in the, the feds should take them like they have been doing, putting covers over them and black vehicles taking them away.
[01:15:35.779 --> 01:15:42.243]  They should take all of them over to the Epstein Island, drop them off, make sure they have no way of coming back.
[01:15:42.998 --> 01:15:45.019]  That way we don't have to worry about them anymore.
[01:15:45.039 --> 01:15:47.040]  And to top it off, put the chair on the top.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:48.620]  Take the Democrats with them, too.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.421]  That will put an end to them.
[01:15:50.461 --> 01:15:53.682]  Well, used to, that's what people would do, is put the folks into exile.
[01:15:54.263 --> 01:16:01.065]  And if they hate America, doesn't think it should exist, and say they want to blow it up and destroy it and say, death to America, absolutely.
[01:16:01.746 --> 01:16:05.007]  Why don't we just ship them to some island and they can all just kill each other?
[01:16:05.748 --> 01:16:08.851]  Yeah, hey, the Jeffrey Epstein Island would be the perfect place.
[01:16:09.391 --> 01:16:09.991]  That's it!
[01:16:10.572 --> 01:16:12.834]  Let's dump them all on Little St.
[01:16:13.554 --> 01:16:14.875]  John or whatever the hell it's called.
[01:16:15.516 --> 01:16:16.517]  Yeah, wherever it is.
[01:16:16.897 --> 01:16:19.859]  Anyways, America, this is the greatest nation on earth.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.963]  And we know, Alex, and I listen to you too, it's good versus evil.
[01:16:25.384 --> 01:16:30.508]  So for all of your callers all over the world who's listening, if you truly believe in Jesus Christ,
[01:16:31.203 --> 01:16:32.544]  Stand up for Jesus.
[01:16:32.764 --> 01:16:33.984]  Stand up for the USA.
[01:16:34.264 --> 01:16:42.749]  Because this country was founded on a Christian nation because of our forefathers who stood up, who gave this country to God.
[01:16:43.129 --> 01:16:50.733]  We cannot sit back and let this free country become communism because of the greed of these rich, wealthy tycoons.
[01:16:51.433 --> 01:16:57.596]  If they have issues with wanting something, they got enough money to build themselves a home on another planet.
[01:16:58.456 --> 01:17:01.098]  Get off of America, get off of this Earth.
[01:17:01.138 --> 01:17:04.340]  Off the Earth, and just go elsewhere.
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:07.923]  That's a great idea, Jeff Bezos, and all of them can just blast off and go to Mars.
[01:17:07.963 --> 01:17:08.303]  Here's the deal.
[01:17:08.764 --> 01:17:12.126]  They got all their wealth through scams, inside deals, and consolidation.
[01:17:12.426 --> 01:17:14.028]  That's why they're waging a war against the middle class.
[01:17:14.048 --> 01:17:18.511]  They just want to have a comfortable life, and be able to just take care of their family.
[01:17:18.871 --> 01:17:21.773]  They are waging war against that, saying we're hurting the Earth.
[01:17:22.134 --> 01:17:26.417]  They're saying our standard of living is too high, while they're funding this system to steal all our wealth.
[01:17:27.077 --> 01:17:30.279]  So they can be fabulously rich like Martian emperors.
[01:17:30.799 --> 01:17:31.420]  Great points.
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:32.440]  We love you, Jacqueline.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.843]  All right, I'm coming back in just a few minutes to go bam, bam, bam to your phone calls.
[01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:42.666]  And then, jam-packed hour number three, InfoWars, still on air, thanks to you!
[01:17:44.347 --> 01:17:47.469]  I want to briefly tell you something before we go back to your amazing calls.
[01:17:48.849 --> 01:17:51.991]  Not because I'm here, again, to say, oh, look how smart I am.
[01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:53.412]  No, no, no, no.
[01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:58.772]  So that you understand the path to victory in defeating these Satanists.
[01:18:00.273 --> 01:18:07.875]  I knew when I got on air 26 years ago that I would be vindicated and I would be proven right.
[01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:09.476]  But I didn't care about that for myself.
[01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:14.658]  I was willing to be attacked, lied about, made fun of, sued, you name it.
[01:18:17.279 --> 01:18:19.100]  They've sent people here trying to kill me, you name it.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.400]  I'm not making a big deal about it.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.100]  It's happened quite a bit.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:21.901]  I just don't even think about it.
[01:18:21.921 --> 01:18:22.661]  It's all in God's hands.
[01:18:26.755 --> 01:18:28.836]  Because I knew they were really going to do all this.
[01:18:30.858 --> 01:18:36.682]  I was watching a Joe Rogan clip because he was talking a bunch about me with that Duncan Trussell guy or whatever his name is.
[01:18:36.702 --> 01:18:37.482]  Interesting, funny fella.
[01:18:37.742 --> 01:18:38.383]  Had him a few times.
[01:18:40.364 --> 01:18:42.686]  And I'm not belittling his name.
[01:18:42.746 --> 01:18:44.067]  It's just not popping in my head right now.
[01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:44.967]  I ate a bunch of barbecue.
[01:18:44.987 --> 01:18:45.728]  That's the big joke.
[01:18:45.788 --> 01:18:49.930]  I can't remember all my kids' grades because I had a big bowl of chili at lunch.
[01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:50.931]  That was true to that position.
[01:18:51.191 --> 01:18:52.712]  They got some barbecue today.
[01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:53.913]  I just ate too much at lunch.
[01:18:53.953 --> 01:18:54.674]  I'm like, whoa.
[01:18:57.233 --> 01:19:00.655]  He was on there going, yeah, who could have predicted all this?
[01:19:00.715 --> 01:19:05.257]  Who could have known all this and the medical tyranny and the trying to forcibly inject this?
[01:19:05.317 --> 01:19:09.259]  And I'm waiting for it and I go, but Alex Jones did.
[01:19:09.279 --> 01:19:11.540]  And he goes, yeah, but Alex Jones did.
[01:19:12.901 --> 01:19:14.322]  And it isn't about me getting the credit.
[01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:17.363]  Do you understand the rest of this is going to happen?
[01:19:18.224 --> 01:19:20.185]  I mean, they plan on killing everybody.
[01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:22.770]  Having robots on every checkpoint?
[01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:27.991]  They're going to get rid of the police, get rid of the human military by criticizing it, by sabotaging it.
[01:19:28.071 --> 01:19:29.311]  It's all been planned out, folks.
[01:19:29.652 --> 01:19:32.172]  They're going to destroy the universities with social justice warriors.
[01:19:32.652 --> 01:19:35.813]  They've already destroyed journalism by buying it off and paying it off.
[01:19:38.333 --> 01:19:44.154]  This is a plan to sabotage everything, and the idiot Satanists that are low-level think they're about to take over.
[01:19:44.294 --> 01:19:44.554]  No!
[01:19:45.134 --> 01:19:49.095]  You are an extermination crew.
[01:19:51.377 --> 01:19:55.179]  You're dialed into a transmission that wants to destroy all life on Earth.
[01:19:58.221 --> 01:20:05.525]  You know, how do geese, a week before a hurricane even forms, know how to leave an area that's going to be hit by a hurricane?
[01:20:05.605 --> 01:20:06.525]  Why do mice do it?
[01:20:08.326 --> 01:20:14.050]  About three days before a big earthquake, usually, they start running out of the holes and climbing trees.
[01:20:15.029 --> 01:20:20.035]  And you'll just go outside and there's mice and rats and everything and trees and you're like... And the ancients went, oh!
[01:20:20.536 --> 01:20:22.058]  The gods are about to shake the mountains.
[01:20:22.078 --> 01:20:30.508]  I mean, they knew when rats and mice are running up trees and running and hiding in your house... How do they know all that?
[01:20:32.202 --> 01:20:34.164]  I did a video on it, it's at Bandot Video.
[01:20:35.024 --> 01:20:37.086]  I didn't come up with a title, I guess Dew did.
[01:20:37.126 --> 01:20:41.630]  It was Will Lucifer Successfully Extinguished the Light of Truth.
[01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:49.597]  And I break all that down, but their AI computers only target and only read about 5% of reality.
[01:20:50.678 --> 01:21:00.026]  Because now the spectrometers and the radio telescopes and all these systems and the mathematical equations show that there's dark matter
[01:21:01.152 --> 01:21:05.513]  That's between 70 and 90% of the universe's energy that they can't even understand or scan.
[01:21:07.694 --> 01:21:11.915]  And then atoms are like 5 to 10% depending on how dense the space you're in.
[01:21:16.297 --> 01:21:20.878]  And then you've got different forms of radiation energy being distributed around.
[01:21:22.386 --> 01:21:28.449]  But 70 to 90% is unreadable and they don't know what it is, but it's there holding it all in place.
[01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:32.250]  And that's why you see all these big globalists saying, we're in a simulation.
[01:21:32.571 --> 01:21:33.631]  Something's holding us here.
[01:21:33.791 --> 01:21:35.412]  We're trying to free humanity from it.
[01:21:35.752 --> 01:21:38.593]  Once we become Silicon Gods, we will break out of this.
[01:21:39.214 --> 01:21:40.634]  They were never atheists, folks.
[01:21:40.734 --> 01:21:41.935]  They're Luciferians.
[01:21:42.495 --> 01:21:43.916]  They don't like God's creation.
[01:21:44.496 --> 01:21:46.037]  They want to be in charge.
[01:21:46.897 --> 01:21:52.201]  But notice the God that made us lets us have freedom and free will and make decisions.
[01:21:52.521 --> 01:21:54.703]  Notice the Satanists always said they were about freedom.
[01:21:55.323 --> 01:21:58.365]  When they get control, they don't even want you to have the ability to think.
[01:21:58.965 --> 01:22:01.427]  They don't want you to join Lucifer willingly.
[01:22:01.807 --> 01:22:08.292]  They want to have you so upside down, so dumbed down, that you don't even know which end is up.
[01:22:08.352 --> 01:22:09.313]  That's not a God.
[01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:26.161]  My God, the real God, built the universe, gave me life, my ancestors, my wife, my children, all the enjoyment, all the things, all the beauty, the ability to see what God made and see the beauty and commune with God, appreciating God and worshiping God for all the great things God's given us.
[01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.487]  And the devil doesn't want us to have communion with that?
[01:22:34.788 --> 01:22:36.190]  The devil wants to control us?
[01:22:37.773 --> 01:22:42.035]  Because we're little G. We're made in the image of God, and we are more powerful than Satan.
[01:22:42.075 --> 01:22:44.677]  Satan's just older and knows the tricks.
[01:22:45.677 --> 01:22:56.343]  It'd be like if a full-grown adult who was hunchback, had snot dripping out their nose, and you know, left a trail of slime behind him, but weighed a hundred pounds, had a two-year-old.
[01:22:56.723 --> 01:23:02.826]  That old wicked man could knock the two-year-old down the stairs or pour gasoline on him and light him on fire.
[01:23:04.414 --> 01:23:05.674]  But see, that's not enough for Satan.
[01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:17.458]  Satan wants to mutate that child and enslave it, and have it desperate, crying out, not knowing why, it's not having communion with God, locked in an artificial reality, a prison.
[01:23:17.738 --> 01:23:23.900]  But I will assure you, the way God works is, it will be Satan locked in the prison that Satan is building for us.
[01:23:26.341 --> 01:23:27.561]  Hell is the prison.
[01:23:29.241 --> 01:23:35.746]  That the devil has made for himself, with all his servants, like David Rockefeller, now in hell.
[01:23:37.247 --> 01:23:39.148]  Like the Rothschilds, now in hell.
[01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:41.410]  Like all of them, in hell.
[01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:47.054]  Selfish, stupid, greedy, cancers, failures, nobodies, nothings.
[01:23:48.916 --> 01:23:51.197]  Not the winners, the losers.
[01:23:51.297 --> 01:23:51.978]  Alright, I'm going to your calls.
[01:23:53.783 --> 01:23:55.065]  There are calls there all over the place.
[01:23:55.206 --> 01:23:55.747]  Calls everywhere.
[01:23:55.767 --> 01:23:56.628]  I'll just say this briefly.
[01:23:57.670 --> 01:24:00.115]  Yesterday I leveled with people and I don't like doing stuff like that.
[01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:04.083]  I don't like, you know, letting the enemy know they've, you know...
[01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:06.468]  Had effects on us, the rest of it.
[01:24:06.488 --> 01:24:07.948]  I don't want to get into all the details of it.
[01:24:08.789 --> 01:24:11.470]  But, and it's the breakdown of the economy, the breakdown of supply chains.
[01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:16.473]  It's a lot of stuff that I have to decide whether we're going to have enough money from sales to be able to order things in the future.
[01:24:17.054 --> 01:24:18.674]  Like everything we're selling, we have in stock.
[01:24:19.215 --> 01:24:24.258]  But then I get to the point where, okay, I can just sell out of my stock and not order more and keep going another six months.
[01:24:26.599 --> 01:24:29.140]  Or do I gamble and buy more stock when I'm not even sure?
[01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:33.283]  And all the other things going on.
[01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:35.691]  So, we just need more capital.
[01:24:35.711 --> 01:24:37.072]  We don't have George Soros, the new ruler.
[01:24:37.112 --> 01:24:47.077]  It's all you buying books and films and t-shirts, and our markups are not that big, so, you know, oh wow, we sell a couple hundred blocket pockets today, or privacy pockets, but we make like eight bucks on them.
[01:24:47.497 --> 01:24:48.378]  That just doesn't pay the bills.
[01:24:48.418 --> 01:24:54.021]  Or, hey, we sold a bunch of, you know, Winter Sun, vitamin D3, with vitamin K, it's great, okay, we made ten bucks on it.
[01:24:54.961 --> 01:24:57.883]  You know, he just doesn't, at the end of the day, have enough money.
[01:24:59.315 --> 01:25:05.218]  So a lot of you stepped up, and I can tell you, if people stepped up like you did yesterday, every day, we could expand, not shut down.
[01:25:06.659 --> 01:25:12.062]  And the problem is, I could contract massively, but under the face of the enemy attack, that's not good.
[01:25:12.563 --> 01:25:15.144]  And then I start looking at people around here thinking, well, who do we get rid of?
[01:25:15.164 --> 01:25:19.927]  Because I could sell everything I got and not keep this place going a few months if no money's coming in.
[01:25:20.776 --> 01:25:21.717]  And that's just where I am.
[01:25:23.178 --> 01:25:25.660]  So I'm not bitching, I'm not complaining, I appreciate you all.
[01:25:26.141 --> 01:25:30.445]  But man, let me tell you, X2, when I forget to tag it, I forgot for like over a month to tag it, like five, six weeks.
[01:25:30.985 --> 01:25:33.207]  And I'm like, man, I'm really putting weight on, I'm still exercising.
[01:25:33.227 --> 01:25:35.789]  And it's like, yeah, I cleaned my desk off.
[01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:37.991]  Where is my X2 now?
[01:25:40.493 --> 01:25:42.195]  Oh my, oh, I took it in the other office.
[01:25:42.998 --> 01:25:44.841]  You guys go in David Nye's studio and bring me the X2.
[01:25:44.961 --> 01:25:46.043]  I was in there the other night.
[01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:47.284]  I took some in there with me.
[01:25:47.765 --> 01:25:48.606]  I've got to keep it.
[01:25:48.646 --> 01:25:52.452]  Nobody's stealing stuff around here, but stuff comes up missing from my desk.
[01:25:53.033 --> 01:25:54.835]  And when I religiously take it every day...
[01:25:56.673 --> 01:26:02.556]  I'm healthy, my libido's better, my skin's healthier, I have more energy, and when I forget to, I don't.
[01:26:02.576 --> 01:26:07.979]  So X2's been sold out for months, and the under-the-tongue liquid, it's back in stock, 50% off, with free shipping.
[01:26:07.999 --> 01:26:10.780]  We're going to extend that sale into next week.
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.841]  The main sale's already four or five days over.
[01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:15.503]  I've got to end it, but I've been putting out so many fires I haven't.
[01:26:15.763 --> 01:26:20.185]  I've got to go meet today with all of the business guys and try to figure out what we've got and what specials we can do.
[01:26:23.038 --> 01:26:24.219]  This sale's got to end soon.
[01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:31.081]  Free shipping on all of our best-selling items like 8-pack Power Stack of the X2 Spray is the only atomic iodine spray out there.
[01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:33.742]  It's for surface and, of course, it's the same iodine.
[01:26:33.762 --> 01:26:34.423]  You can ingest it.
[01:26:34.443 --> 01:26:35.283]  It's really, really good for you.
[01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:36.363]  Here's the X2 Spray.
[01:26:36.403 --> 01:26:38.084]  Here's the X2 under the tongue.
[01:26:38.504 --> 01:26:41.806]  And they're both 50% off with free shipping right now at InfoWarsware.com.
[01:26:41.846 --> 01:26:45.047]  And I just got to tell you, the good halogen is just spectacular, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:49.168]  Because if you don't have the good halogens in your body, it absorbs the bad halogens into your glands.
[01:26:49.348 --> 01:26:49.768]  Read about it.
[01:26:50.148 --> 01:26:58.311]  The UN admits almost 3 billion people have cognitive disabilities and brain damage because they didn't get enough iodine.
[01:27:01.052 --> 01:27:08.755]  And the globalists work around the clock to make sure that you don't get enough of it.
[01:27:08.895 --> 01:27:09.676]  It's essential.
[01:27:10.696 --> 01:27:13.437]  Essential means if you have no iodine, you will die.
[01:27:14.514 --> 01:27:15.835]  It's not like oxygen, five minutes.
[01:27:15.855 --> 01:27:17.457]  It's not like water, four or five days.
[01:27:17.477 --> 01:27:18.317]  It's not like food, a month.
[01:27:19.158 --> 01:27:20.419]  But it will get you.
[01:27:20.739 --> 01:27:22.701]  And the system doesn't want you knowing that.
[01:27:23.202 --> 01:27:24.483]  So however you get your eye on it, I get it.
[01:27:24.503 --> 01:27:28.927]  But this is the best you're gonna find out there from my research, The Purist, and it supports the InfoWar, a 360 win.
[01:27:29.287 --> 01:27:30.128]  InfoWarShore.com.
[01:27:30.188 --> 01:27:31.189]  Okay, I apologize.
[01:27:31.969 --> 01:27:32.570]  I'm done plugging.
[01:27:33.988 --> 01:27:38.973]  When we return, I'm going bam, bam, bam to Presley and Blake and Jeff and CeCe and Black Lightning.
[01:27:39.433 --> 01:27:40.594]  That's a cool name.
[01:27:40.634 --> 01:27:42.176]  John and Annie and Steve and Paul.
[01:27:42.196 --> 01:27:43.457]  We're going to the order they received.
[01:27:43.477 --> 01:27:45.259]  Hour number three straight ahead.
[01:27:45.279 --> 01:27:51.685]  And we'll take you inside the Antifa training centers provided by the mayor of Portland.
[01:27:53.695 --> 01:27:57.077]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[01:27:57.097 --> 01:27:58.238]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:27:58.258 --> 01:27:59.819]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:01.361]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[01:28:01.481 --> 01:28:02.501]  I want them shut down.
[01:28:02.561 --> 01:28:03.462]  I want them silenced.
[01:28:03.522 --> 01:28:04.323]  I want them muted.
[01:28:04.363 --> 01:28:06.144]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:28:06.164 --> 01:28:07.105]  You kept us on air.
[01:28:07.225 --> 01:28:08.546]  We did the analysis first.
[01:28:08.806 --> 01:28:09.807]  It's now gone mainstream.
[01:28:09.867 --> 01:28:11.668]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[01:28:11.948 --> 01:28:17.833]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[01:28:18.413 --> 01:28:19.494]  You need to stop right now.
[01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:20.656]  And they're very, very serious.
[01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:23.158]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[01:28:23.198 --> 01:28:24.099]  This is not going to happen.
[01:28:24.119 --> 01:28:26.062]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[01:28:26.482 --> 01:28:27.603]  I used to say, support InfoWars.
[01:28:28.044 --> 01:28:28.945]  Rescue InfoWars.
[01:28:29.025 --> 01:28:29.686]  Save yourself.
[01:28:30.026 --> 01:28:30.687]  Save the world.
[01:28:30.987 --> 01:28:31.848]  We're in this together.
[01:28:32.088 --> 01:28:32.949]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:34.571]  Communism's up here.
[01:28:34.771 --> 01:28:37.733]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[01:28:38.133 --> 01:28:39.934]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[01:28:40.155 --> 01:28:41.716]  My children are right here!
[01:28:42.436 --> 01:28:44.177]  But I need money to fight a war!
[01:28:44.377 --> 01:28:45.438]  And I need word of mouth!
[01:28:45.658 --> 01:28:46.559]  And I need prayer!
[01:28:46.699 --> 01:28:47.660]  And I need action!
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.621]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[01:28:50.342 --> 01:28:52.323]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[01:28:53.444 --> 01:28:54.584]  Something you'll never forget.
[01:28:54.604 --> 01:28:56.406]  Alright, let's go right to your phone calls.
[01:28:56.426 --> 01:28:57.506]  Appreciate you all holding.
[01:28:58.627 --> 01:29:00.489]  Let's go to Presley in North Carolina.
[01:29:00.549 --> 01:29:00.909]  Thank you.
[01:29:01.988 --> 01:29:02.889]  You better set me free.
[01:29:02.909 --> 01:29:04.209]  Go ahead, Presley.
[01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.550]  All right.
[01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:08.692]  APEC Power Stack changed my life.
[01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:10.013]  I'm from North Carolina.
[01:29:10.113 --> 01:29:11.073]  I'm a real person.
[01:29:11.093 --> 01:29:14.836]  There's not too many Presleys in North Carolina, so if anybody wants to look me up, go ahead.
[01:29:15.736 --> 01:29:18.518]  I've been experiencing medical tyranny since April.
[01:29:18.558 --> 01:29:19.919]  I'm a type 1 diabetic.
[01:29:20.079 --> 01:29:24.001]  I've got diabetic retinopathy, which means I need eye treatment.
[01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:33.625]  I've been denied medical treatment, numerous doctor's office visits, because I refuse to wear a mask, because of religious beliefs and medical.
[01:29:34.562 --> 01:29:35.563]  Concerns as well.
[01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:44.988]  I'm also going through a worker's comp issue and I can't get an x-ray on my foot, which I'm worried about losing because of my diabetes, because I won't wear a mask.
[01:29:45.028 --> 01:29:48.971]  They won't even let me in at the end of the day for a five-minute CT scan on my foot.
[01:29:49.491 --> 01:29:52.793]  And my worker's compensation lawyers want me to take the easy money.
[01:29:53.293 --> 01:29:56.115]  I've contacted North Carolina Senator Tom Tillis.
[01:29:57.056 --> 01:29:59.717]  They referred me to the North Carolina Bar Association
[01:30:01.548 --> 01:30:06.934]  And they are basically saying that there is no law you're willing to take up my case in North Carolina.
[01:30:07.014 --> 01:30:08.175]  It's a First Amendment case.
[01:30:08.796 --> 01:30:09.416]  And help me out.
[01:30:09.877 --> 01:30:19.087]  And my primary care doctor refuses and is not allowed to write me a medical exemption note even though I qualify for a medical exemption.
[01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.389]  It is beyond tyranny.
[01:30:21.529 --> 01:30:23.131]  I am so frustrated, man.
[01:30:23.191 --> 01:30:24.072]  I can't even tell you.
[01:30:25.416 --> 01:30:48.012]  And brother, again, they tell you, oh, white people are bad, Europe's bad, America's bad, we're being mean to the black people, and they show a few cases of things that may be wrong, and then they attack black people, white people, you name it, for not wearing masks, and savagely beat people, and stomp their heads, and beat women all over the world, and then it's okay, because it's all the media that's doing this, and the media is the enemy.
[01:30:48.052 --> 01:30:48.713]  They are sick.
[01:30:50.012 --> 01:30:54.575]  I said, if I was Jewish or Muslim, we wouldn't even be having this religious conversation right now.
[01:30:54.635 --> 01:30:55.536]  It's disgusting.
[01:30:57.898 --> 01:30:59.799]  They don't care if you're a white Christian.
[01:31:00.079 --> 01:31:00.720]  They don't care.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:07.745]  Well, that's because, listen, white Christians have laid down and have been told, be moral, do what we say, or you're racist.
[01:31:07.785 --> 01:31:09.286]  And so we've done what they say.
[01:31:09.646 --> 01:31:11.528]  So now they're like, OK, don't say your father or mother.
[01:31:11.588 --> 01:31:12.688]  OK, wear a mask all the time.
[01:31:12.969 --> 01:31:14.210]  OK, your business isn't essential.
[01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:15.030]  You've got to be shut down.
[01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:16.071]  That's what they're doing, brother.
[01:31:16.946 --> 01:31:24.549]  Yeah, and one final thing before I go, I think Trump's October surprise might have something to do with Joseph Gregory Hallett.
[01:31:24.969 --> 01:31:32.853]  It could be BS, there are some things that concern me about it, but he is basically claiming the title of the King of England.
[01:31:32.993 --> 01:31:39.996]  He's put in papers going back to January, but I think that's what's going on over there in England with the whole royal family
[01:31:40.734 --> 01:31:43.315]  Hi Alex, I've got an idea for Trump's October surprise.
[01:31:43.355 --> 01:31:44.635]  Man, my eyes have been open recently.
[01:31:44.655 --> 01:31:45.795]  I've been awake for many years.
[01:31:45.815 --> 01:31:48.236]  You've got a lot to do with that, but that's another story.
[01:31:48.996 --> 01:31:52.837]  It's kind of like taking a nap and your kids are messing around in the kitchen.
[01:32:09.193 --> 01:32:11.415]  Your eyes aren't open, but you're awake, you know?
[01:32:11.435 --> 01:32:13.536]  It's like Rip Van Winkle wakes up.
[01:32:15.357 --> 01:32:16.178]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:32:16.218 --> 01:32:19.961]  But my message to Trump, the narrative is well defended.
[01:32:20.561 --> 01:32:25.965]  But the proof that all this is a hoax, that we're being locked down for no reason, is more and more irrefutable.
[01:32:26.045 --> 01:32:27.406]  He cannot be blind to that.
[01:32:27.906 --> 01:32:29.847]  There is no reason for this vaccine, none.
[01:32:29.867 --> 01:32:30.608]  You know what?
[01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:31.248]  Stay there, Blake.
[01:32:31.469 --> 01:32:32.189]  I don't want to cut you short.
[01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:32.950]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:34.511]  I meant to start the show today.
[01:32:35.578 --> 01:32:40.962]  With what you just said, that Trump can't just say, okay, it only kills old people and it's exaggerated.
[01:32:41.562 --> 01:32:44.504]  He's got to go to the heart of, it was engineered to kill our economy.
[01:32:44.984 --> 01:32:47.406]  They tell us America's bad, but it came out of China.
[01:32:48.067 --> 01:32:50.228]  And look, almost no one is sick from it.
[01:32:51.129 --> 01:32:53.630]  90% of the tests are fake, positives.
[01:32:53.931 --> 01:32:56.372]  They used all the numbers of dead people that died of other things.
[01:32:56.612 --> 01:33:03.957]  He needs to frontally assault it and say the hoax needs to end, the mask wearing needs to end, the lockdowns need to end now.
[01:33:05.218 --> 01:33:11.220]  And point out, the UN estimates another 8 million people are going to starve to death this year, conservatively, because of it.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.441]  I think that's a very conservative number.
[01:33:12.461 --> 01:33:19.103]  So the very UN engineering this is now saying give them money to feed these people they're starving to death.
[01:33:19.423 --> 01:33:21.864]  COVID didn't cause the global lockdown and starvation.
[01:33:22.224 --> 01:33:23.244]  COVID was the excuse.
[01:33:23.284 --> 01:33:24.445]  The hysteria did.
[01:33:24.825 --> 01:33:25.365]  We'll be right back.
[01:33:27.219 --> 01:33:42.010]  It was a real gamble by Bill Gates, the Rockefellers, and the Rothschilds with the Deep State, the Clintons, and the Obamas, and the shy coms heading it up with the media to launch the whole COVID-19 martial law lockdown when they were running the Wuhan lab and all the rest of it.
[01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:51.797]  But they cooked it up with the Rockefeller Foundation, Project Lockstep, and there were other British Ministry of Defense reports about use of bioweapon to bring in martial law, if the public was ever revolting.
[01:33:52.057 --> 01:33:53.078]  This stuff's come out before.
[01:33:53.814 --> 01:34:02.662]  I can tell you, kill a revolution in Hong Kong or in the UK or the US or Brazil as you release a bioweapon to change the subject, have an excuse to lock down your political enemies.
[01:34:02.942 --> 01:34:04.464]  But then the left, they're allowed to march.
[01:34:04.744 --> 01:34:05.825]  They're allowed to have their jobs.
[01:34:06.045 --> 01:34:07.166]  They're allowed to get their hair cut.
[01:34:07.186 --> 01:34:09.068]  They're allowed because they're part of the ruling class.
[01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:12.311]  So it's true discrimination we're being taught about.
[01:34:13.695 --> 01:34:19.418]  But what a gamble as it comes out that the virus is one of the weakest viruses ever known, but does the false positive.
[01:34:19.798 --> 01:34:20.819]  So that's why they used it.
[01:34:21.179 --> 01:34:22.119]  To make everybody suspect.
[01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:25.341]  And now the former Australian Prime Minister says it's a health dictatorship.
[01:34:25.721 --> 01:34:26.382]  Hysteria.
[01:34:26.402 --> 01:34:29.904]  It's exaggerated unendingly.
[01:34:30.324 --> 01:34:31.504]  This is the important news.
[01:34:31.564 --> 01:34:33.065]  Get this out to everyone you know.
[01:34:34.006 --> 01:34:39.489]  That's why they're trying to censor even the CDC's own numbers because their whole narrative of 3%, 4% we're gonna die.
[01:34:41.029 --> 01:34:41.810]  You know how many people that'd be?
[01:34:43.072 --> 01:34:53.597]  If 4% of the United States died, that's 4 million, 4 million, 4 million for the 300 million, then we're another 50, 60, 70 million, no one knows.
[01:34:54.598 --> 01:35:03.742]  So let's say another 3 million, 4 million, 4 million, 4 million, 12 million, 13 million, 14 million, 15 million people would be dead right now.
[01:35:05.683 --> 01:35:06.243]  15 million people.
[01:35:07.484 --> 01:35:07.724]  15 million.
[01:35:10.222 --> 01:35:13.284]  Not a million worldwide, folks, and they're counting every death number.
[01:35:13.304 --> 01:35:13.765]  Let me show you this.
[01:35:13.785 --> 01:35:14.445]  We're going to your calls.
[01:35:16.146 --> 01:35:16.847]  CNBC.
[01:35:16.967 --> 01:35:18.508]  Key coronavirus forecast.
[01:35:18.888 --> 01:35:19.328]  Key.
[01:35:19.809 --> 01:35:21.350]  Oh, and the forecasts have all been lies.
[01:35:22.691 --> 01:35:23.712]  Predicts over 410,000 total U.S.
[01:35:23.752 --> 01:35:25.693]  deaths by January 1st.
[01:35:25.993 --> 01:35:27.174]  The worst is yet to come.
[01:35:27.634 --> 01:35:38.222]  Because winter's coming and there'll be lots of flu and lots of pneumonia and lots of death and locked up old folks that family can't see and a lot of fun, a lot of ventilating them, a lot of getting that $52,000 cash.
[01:35:42.107 --> 01:35:46.570]  Oh, the Democrat states are gonna murder some old people and make some money, money, money, money.
[01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:49.411]  Money, money, money, money!
[01:35:53.933 --> 01:35:56.174]  And it's the same recycled hoax over and over again.
[01:35:56.294 --> 01:35:57.575]  Oh, the hospitals are full!
[01:35:57.995 --> 01:35:58.996]  Stay in your house!
[01:35:59.436 --> 01:36:01.877]  So the hospitals aren't full, they're empty.
[01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:08.701]  And the governor, what, a month and a half ago, put us back down under partial lockdown in Texas and he said,
[01:36:10.126 --> 01:36:14.448]  Oh, because we've got to keep the hospitals, you know, not too full, because they're full.
[01:36:14.608 --> 01:36:16.429]  And we went to the hospitals, he said they were totally empty.
[01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:19.171]  And Abbott's not stupid.
[01:36:19.211 --> 01:36:20.231]  So they're blackmailing him.
[01:36:20.271 --> 01:36:21.232]  I don't know what Abbott's into.
[01:36:21.252 --> 01:36:25.814]  Might have to do with some land deals down in San Antonio.
[01:36:25.834 --> 01:36:31.557]  You know, I really don't have to play hardball with the governor.
[01:36:33.238 --> 01:36:35.459]  Maybe I should go meet with some people at the legislature.
[01:36:42.159 --> 01:36:47.984]  Certain business groups down in San Antonio, they did 10 years ago.
[01:36:48.004 --> 01:36:57.552]  Yeah, there's, you know, I think it's time to take the gloves off a little bit, isn't it?
[01:37:00.715 --> 01:37:01.475]  Let's just leave it right there.
[01:37:02.336 --> 01:37:05.058]  Okay, let's go back to Blake in Arkansas.
[01:37:05.118 --> 01:37:06.319]  Blake, you're on the air.
[01:37:07.159 --> 01:37:08.519]  I really appreciate you, Blake.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:10.600]  Go ahead and recap what you were saying.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:15.221]  Trump needs to get out in front of this and expose it and destroy it, just like I did.
[01:37:15.342 --> 01:37:16.422]  Yes, it kills people.
[01:37:16.982 --> 01:37:21.543]  It's way weaker than the flu, but they're lying to you about everything else to keep things locked down, and they're all hypocrites.
[01:37:21.783 --> 01:37:32.927]  With this Pelosi thing, and all these other Democrats caught without masks and out at restaurants, and all the Democrat mayors, it's time to stop it now before they bring in the contact tracing and all the rest of it and another lockdown.
[01:37:33.147 --> 01:37:33.787]  What do you say?
[01:37:33.867 --> 01:37:36.128]  Lay it out, your emergency measures to the President, Blake.
[01:37:37.552 --> 01:37:41.794]  As I was saying, the proof that it's a hoax is more and more irrefutable.
[01:37:42.154 --> 01:37:43.995]  There's no reason for this vaccine.
[01:37:44.075 --> 01:37:44.936]  It's being rushed.
[01:37:45.056 --> 01:37:51.739]  Your videos with the doctor talking about the versions of the vaccine, the Human 2.0, everybody needs to see that.
[01:37:52.319 --> 01:37:57.622]  Key, Trump is under currently emerging pandemic protocols.
[01:37:58.243 --> 01:38:00.024]  That gives him special permission.
[01:38:00.084 --> 01:38:05.605]  This idea is wild, but charge into these facilities making these different vaccines.
[01:38:05.725 --> 01:38:07.426]  I don't know what parts of the world they're in.
[01:38:07.446 --> 01:38:18.589]  I don't know who he can find in the military to trust to carry out his executive order, but go into the go into these facilities, find the hard drives, find all the documents you can find the inventory.
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:25.842]  Evacuate the human lives and blow it off the freaking... Well, you know why they... Listen, brother, you're so smart.
[01:38:25.902 --> 01:38:26.882]  I should have been saying this myself.
[01:38:27.402 --> 01:38:31.023]  Like, I have, but this is right in the center.
[01:38:31.043 --> 01:38:31.343]  2015, U.S.
[01:38:31.363 --> 01:38:40.006]  scientists, it wasn't a partisan issue, are like, you can't have chimera gain of function, viruses being made at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, other areas.
[01:38:41.018 --> 01:38:44.681]  And that was all under Bill Gates funding, literally, the whole thing, and Fauci.
[01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:45.261]  They ran it!
[01:38:45.321 --> 01:38:46.442]  This is mainline news!
[01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:49.465]  We broke it eight months ago, but it became mainline news four months later.
[01:38:50.906 --> 01:38:54.829]  And so they moved it to Wuhan in 2015 to do it illegally there!
[01:38:55.229 --> 01:39:00.974]  So how does Trump raid Wuhan and get all the... That's why they run the fact-checkers that run Facebook out of Wuhan.
[01:39:01.234 --> 01:39:04.256]  They run the main testing that's approved testing out of Wuhan.
[01:39:04.276 --> 01:39:06.158]  The whole criminal operation
[01:39:07.031 --> 01:39:10.413]  I believe it, and I understand, I understand the limitations, but at this point it is
[01:39:28.661 --> 01:39:30.923]  Approvable crime against humanity.
[01:39:44.767 --> 01:39:52.989]  Moved with the Secretary of State and others against the UN and Human Rights Council that's going after our military, claiming jurisdiction over the U.S., which is a total joke.
[01:39:53.549 --> 01:39:55.389]  They're trying to treat us like we're Serbia or something.
[01:39:55.749 --> 01:39:56.629]  And so you're damn right.
[01:39:57.029 --> 01:40:03.531]  But no, I just say, look, the Joint Chiefs don't want to say China did it because we'll have to go to war with them.
[01:40:03.571 --> 01:40:07.731]  Well, they already went to war with us and they're using it with their cohorts to shut our economy down.
[01:40:08.032 --> 01:40:10.112]  And so all I'm saying is I'm not a warmonger.
[01:40:11.247 --> 01:40:13.931]  But if somebody actually attacks us, I say go after them.
[01:40:13.951 --> 01:40:14.452]  What do you say?
[01:40:15.794 --> 01:40:17.477]  I'm not a warmonger either, but...
[01:40:18.203 --> 01:40:20.305]  He's got the power to make a move now.
[01:40:20.365 --> 01:40:23.347]  We're all sitting back on our haunches, waiting to see what's happening.
[01:40:23.888 --> 01:40:30.933]  No army can make Americans stay inside and destroy generations of wealth, and teach our kids to be lazy, and soon we're going to be in bigger debt.
[01:40:31.154 --> 01:40:33.716]  I mean, the global depression is unstoppable now.
[01:40:34.196 --> 01:40:35.697]  I just want to hold it off until he gets re-elected.
[01:40:36.098 --> 01:40:38.339]  And even after that, he's going to have a hell of a thing on his hands.
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.882]  He needs to blame it on them now, because they deserve it.
[01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:43.563]  They're blaming him and America when they did it!
[01:40:43.823 --> 01:40:44.483]  Give it to them!
[01:40:44.523 --> 01:40:45.163]  Destroy them!
[01:40:45.784 --> 01:40:48.785]  Trump tried to act nice with these people, and it's not the way to do it.
[01:40:49.205 --> 01:40:52.186]  His biggest failing was playing patty cake with them six months ago.
[01:40:52.726 --> 01:40:57.108]  But they were telling him, oh play patty cake, we want to fix this together, and they all turned around and stabbed him in the back.
[01:40:57.508 --> 01:40:58.828]  He needs to destroy them.
[01:40:58.868 --> 01:41:00.829]  They're not Americans, they're foreign enemies.
[01:41:01.089 --> 01:41:02.089]  What else you want to say to the President?
[01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:07.511]  It's an extreme crime, and to fight it may take extreme measures.
[01:41:08.452 --> 01:41:09.712]  And I believe
[01:41:10.399 --> 01:41:16.264]  I believe Trump can make a difference, but I'm not going to sit back and expect one man to fix it from the inside out.
[01:41:16.744 --> 01:41:17.544]  Well, you just said it.
[01:41:17.585 --> 01:41:18.205]  You just said it.
[01:41:18.966 --> 01:41:19.686]  Extreme measures.
[01:41:19.766 --> 01:41:20.827]  We didn't do all this.
[01:41:20.887 --> 01:41:21.748]  They brought us here.
[01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:25.931]  I mean, World War II was extreme measures.
[01:41:25.991 --> 01:41:26.751]  We didn't start that.
[01:41:26.791 --> 01:41:27.332]  Hitler did.
[01:41:27.652 --> 01:41:29.293]  They have started a war with us.
[01:41:29.353 --> 01:41:29.774]  What do we do?
[01:41:32.074 --> 01:41:34.936]  We start from the outside and work our way in.
[01:41:35.216 --> 01:41:37.798]  We stop doing what they're telling us to do.
[01:41:38.218 --> 01:41:41.120]  I'm going to football games on a Thursday and Friday night.
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:44.902]  75% of the masks are not being worn.
[01:41:45.042 --> 01:41:45.642]  They're comfortable.
[01:41:45.662 --> 01:41:46.703]  They're doing it, okay?
[01:41:47.043 --> 01:41:52.606]  But then you walk into Walmart, and I am the only person in the Walmart not wearing a mask.
[01:41:52.666 --> 01:41:58.870]  So why are you bowing down for Chinese-run Walmart, but you won't do it under the Friday night lights?
[01:41:59.871 --> 01:42:00.431]  Get real.
[01:42:00.811 --> 01:42:01.712]  If you don't believe it,
[01:42:02.242 --> 01:42:03.343]  Don't participate in it.
[01:42:05.784 --> 01:42:06.205]  That's it.
[01:42:06.365 --> 01:42:07.406]  Because it is a fraud.
[01:42:07.606 --> 01:42:09.267]  I mean, have you seen the numbers?
[01:42:09.287 --> 01:42:10.408]  I mean, now it's like .000.
[01:42:14.190 --> 01:42:18.053]  I didn't have good numbers in math in high school, but those are easy numbers to understand.
[01:42:18.073 --> 01:42:19.013]  I even get that.
[01:42:21.195 --> 01:42:22.976]  It's not even a tenth of a percent.
[01:42:23.016 --> 01:42:25.918]  It's not even a... It doesn't even... It's ridiculous.
[01:42:26.678 --> 01:42:28.400]  But still, oh, we're heroes.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.140]  Wear your mask.
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:29.760]  Don't be a wimp.
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:30.441]  God bless you, brother.
[01:42:30.461 --> 01:42:31.802]  Alright, I spent a lot of time with Blake.
[01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:34.891]  We're gonna go to Steve and everybody else.
[01:42:34.911 --> 01:42:36.732]  We come back in Black Lightning and CeCe.
[01:42:36.772 --> 01:42:37.412]  Everybody stay there.
[01:42:38.132 --> 01:42:38.633]  It's Friday.
[01:42:38.673 --> 01:42:39.393]  I'm taking your calls.
[01:42:39.433 --> 01:42:40.073]  I know I'm ranting.
[01:42:40.133 --> 01:42:48.177]  It's just we're 59 days out, folks, and it's like watching a toddler run out into a highway and you're 100 yards away and can't help him.
[01:42:48.397 --> 01:42:49.778]  And you see that 18-wheeler coming.
[01:42:49.818 --> 01:42:50.618]  It's about to run him over.
[01:42:50.638 --> 01:42:51.339]  I mean, we are
[01:42:52.478 --> 01:42:54.120]  We are all in the crosshairs here.
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:58.325]  This is... I cannot tell you how serious it is.
[01:42:58.745 --> 01:42:59.886]  I mean, I'm not trying to be dramatic.
[01:43:00.187 --> 01:43:03.711]  This is the time to be engaged and involved and praying now.
[01:43:04.832 --> 01:43:06.734]  Alright, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:06.894 --> 01:43:08.256]  We're going to your phone calls right now.
[01:43:08.276 --> 01:43:11.139]  Annie was a liberal red-pilled.
[01:43:12.168 --> 01:43:13.850]  Revolution happening in California.
[01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:16.512]  Yeah, people are either running for their lives or waking up.
[01:43:16.652 --> 01:43:17.473]  Annie, thanks for holding.
[01:43:17.513 --> 01:43:18.514]  Thanks for calling in today.
[01:43:18.554 --> 01:43:19.435]  We really appreciate you.
[01:43:20.016 --> 01:43:22.838]  Tell us about your red pillion, your experience, and what you're seeing in California.
[01:43:23.759 --> 01:43:24.160]  Okay.
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:24.800]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:25.581]  This is Annie.
[01:43:25.741 --> 01:43:29.044]  First-time caller from lovely Oakland, California.
[01:43:31.272 --> 01:43:37.956]  I wanted to just actually plug your products, because it was through your products that I came to hear your show.
[01:43:37.976 --> 01:43:57.806]  I was given as a gift by one of my conservative relatives for Christmas some of the Super Female Vitality and some of the turmeric, and I was one of those liberals that would rather like dive and darken the doorway of the InfoWars website.
[01:43:58.945 --> 01:44:06.973]  But I loved the product and I didn't know it was related to Alex Jones because I always thought Alex Jones was just some lunatic conspiracy theorist.
[01:44:07.514 --> 01:44:17.404]  But when I ran out of the product and wanted more, my cousin said, well, go to Infowarsstore.com to get the product because it changed my life.
[01:44:17.644 --> 01:44:19.646]  I went from just being exhausted and
[01:44:22.776 --> 01:44:25.978]  Well, I want to hear your story, because your phone was great until just now, Annie.
[01:44:25.998 --> 01:44:27.019]  You said, change your life.
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:28.240]  Now your phone's come back.
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:28.821]  Please continue.
[01:44:29.821 --> 01:44:34.205]  Well, no, I'm saying the product, the Super Female Vitality, I'd never had anything like it.
[01:44:34.245 --> 01:44:35.085]  It gave me clarity.
[01:44:35.126 --> 01:44:36.006]  It gave me energy.
[01:44:36.026 --> 01:44:36.747]  I ran out.
[01:44:37.407 --> 01:44:39.989]  My cousin said, go to Infowarrestore.com.
[01:44:40.009 --> 01:44:42.251]  I just... Jones.
[01:44:42.811 --> 01:44:49.497]  So I go there to get some more product for myself, because I'd really come to depend on it for my daily function.
[01:44:50.357 --> 01:44:52.399]  And I thought I was supporting an Infowar.
[01:44:53.257 --> 01:44:57.079]  Well, I was reporting, so I started listening to your show.
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:02.862]  And all of a sudden, I realized, this guy is speaking truth, you know?
[01:45:03.062 --> 01:45:09.486]  I'm not... And I began... And I slowly just... I was actually red-pilled right away.
[01:45:09.626 --> 01:45:17.470]  And now, as I speak, my son-in-law owns a barber shop in Oakland, and today is the first day he's opened it.
[01:45:18.445 --> 01:45:20.467]  And I'm going to babysit my grandson.
[01:45:20.967 --> 01:45:24.451]  Our people here in California are starving, literally.
[01:45:25.051 --> 01:45:33.939]  Last year at this time, my son-in-law was making money hand over fist, and my grandson, they were putting him in a very nice school.
[01:45:34.099 --> 01:45:42.186]  And now, I'm going down, I've relocated to Northern California, and I want to touch on Carlos that you spoke to.
[01:45:43.027 --> 01:45:46.748]  But I'm coming down here four days a week because they can't afford child care.
[01:45:47.369 --> 01:45:48.009]  Unbelievable!
[01:45:48.289 --> 01:45:51.690]  And so you see... Yeah, downtown Webster, Oakland, California.
[01:45:52.151 --> 01:45:58.373]  He opens his barbershop, and I don't know if Nancy Pelosi has anything to do with that, but today's the first day.
[01:45:58.413 --> 01:46:07.757]  So I'm babysitting for free, but I'm living in Northern California, and I want to touch on Carlos that you had on your show.
[01:46:07.777 --> 01:46:08.037]  He's awesome.
[01:46:08.057 --> 01:46:10.238]  The gentleman who spoke to the county, right?
[01:46:10.358 --> 01:46:10.938]  Yes, we love him.
[01:46:12.154 --> 01:46:26.265]  And in our area, because I became a conservative and I started listening to your show, I moved from Oakland, so I'm splitting my time between Oakland and Mount Shasta, which is the Siskiyou County, one county up.
[01:46:27.106 --> 01:46:32.070]  And the people there have been ready to take up arms, but they've been needing a leader.
[01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:41.097]  And in Carlos, he's articulate, he's intelligent, he's got a background in the Marines, and people are beginning to follow him.
[01:46:42.156 --> 01:46:46.298]  But the point I want to make... Alex, have you heard of the State of Jefferson?
[01:46:46.318 --> 01:46:47.678]  I have.
[01:46:48.599 --> 01:46:48.919]  You have?
[01:46:49.019 --> 01:46:59.363]  Okay, so in Northern California in 1920, then Northern California and Southern Oregon attempted to succeed, and they wanted to call it the State of Jefferson, right?
[01:46:59.883 --> 01:47:01.404]  And then there was another push, I think, in 1950.
[01:47:01.484 --> 01:47:08.787]  Right now, because I travel Highway 5 between Oakland and Northern... Oh, there's a big push to split the state in three.
[01:47:10.137 --> 01:47:14.759]  Well right now, as I travel Highway 5, there are billboards everywhere.
[01:47:15.059 --> 01:47:18.020]  Join the State of Jefferson www.bit.
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:27.384]  So there's a huge push for Northern California to succeed from the rest of California and Southern Oregon.
[01:47:28.184 --> 01:47:29.404]  Completely different people.
[01:47:30.425 --> 01:47:33.426]  So I'm just thinking if our brethren are going to take up arms
[01:47:34.239 --> 01:47:37.141]  Maybe that should be the cause, you know?
[01:47:37.962 --> 01:48:00.078]  Maybe it's time that... Well, if there was ever a time we're entering that where they're starving people to death, families are having to move in together, they're running out of money, homelessness is at all-time highs, people not having money for food is at all-time highs, and it's all designed to make us blame the president who just wants us to be a sovereign country, and the PSYOP is so intense
[01:48:00.879 --> 01:48:12.185]  That either people believe the lie, because it's too hard not to believe, because it's so fabulously huge, like Joseph Goebbels said, we're going to tell a lie, make sure it's super giant, because people won't think you're making up something that big.
[01:48:13.226 --> 01:48:19.489]  And so, I mean, the tactics they're using are so dangerous, and it's because Pelosi and all these people don't run things.
[01:48:20.189 --> 01:48:22.310]  A consortium of foreign banks do through China.
[01:48:22.991 --> 01:48:25.872]  And they don't care if Democrats win or lose, they just want to wreck us.
[01:48:26.532 --> 01:48:29.134]  And so if America would just wake up and realize this is a foreign attack,
[01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:38.315]  And reject it all, we could turn it around like that, but... We have to understand that Bill Gates and these others are allied with the Chai-coms, and are the enemy.
[01:48:39.076 --> 01:48:40.917]  And so, there can't be any half-measures.
[01:48:40.977 --> 01:48:43.059]  If we don't do that, there's absolutely no hope.
[01:48:43.079 --> 01:48:45.900]  We have to have full awakening, and full rejection.
[01:48:45.921 --> 01:48:46.741]  It's like having poison.
[01:48:47.261 --> 01:48:49.283]  You don't just go, oh, I've swallowed poison.
[01:48:49.703 --> 01:48:50.203]  Too bad.
[01:48:50.383 --> 01:48:51.784]  No, you have to get it out of your stomach.
[01:48:52.265 --> 01:48:53.345]  You have to get it out of your body.
[01:48:53.386 --> 01:48:55.447]  And if it's in your blood, you gotta take an antidote.
[01:48:55.807 --> 01:48:57.328]  Well, the antidote is not complying.
[01:48:57.348 --> 01:48:58.309]  What do you think, Annie?
[01:49:00.146 --> 01:49:04.769]  What I think is, and my heart breaks, is that, okay, my kids are millennial.
[01:49:04.889 --> 01:49:12.133]  They are as liberal as can be, and it's like there's a deception of darkness.
[01:49:12.754 --> 01:49:13.914]  I don't know what it will take.
[01:49:14.254 --> 01:49:23.400]  The guy owns a barber shop in Oakland, and yesterday he saw Pelosi get her hair cut, and that hasn't turned him away from
[01:49:24.514 --> 01:49:25.716]  And he's just one person.
[01:49:25.756 --> 01:49:29.080]  I'm saying they're just asleep, and yeah, I'd love them to wake up.
[01:49:29.301 --> 01:49:31.864]  I woke up, but understand, I'm 50.
[01:49:32.645 --> 01:49:34.948]  I'm a different generation than the millennials.
[01:49:35.168 --> 01:49:40.355]  Well, you've got to put pressure on them and explain that they're under cognitive dissonance and Stockholm syndrome.
[01:49:40.976 --> 01:49:55.370]  And just explain to them that it all feels good being in a cult and being in the peer pressure, but when the cult tries to keep you on the farm, when the cult tells you to hate yourself, when the cult suddenly you don't have food on the table because what the cult's saying, the cult ain't good.
[01:49:56.271 --> 01:50:02.737]  So if, I mean, if you're in a group willingly and things are good and people are free to say what they want, then you're not in a cult.
[01:50:04.076 --> 01:50:05.437]  No, this is a bad cult.
[01:50:05.797 --> 01:50:07.059]  And they think we have no memory.
[01:50:07.339 --> 01:50:10.361]  They think once they destroy the economy, we're going to blame America for it.
[01:50:11.102 --> 01:50:11.883]  Cloud and Piven.
[01:50:12.463 --> 01:50:16.366]  And so maybe you can take, you know, this little piece of the show and talk to your family and explain to them.
[01:50:17.587 --> 01:50:18.888]  I've been under cognitive dissonance too.
[01:50:18.948 --> 01:50:20.209]  I've been wrong about things in my life.
[01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:23.772]  As you get older, you learn where you were wrong through experience, but you've got to admit you're wrong.
[01:50:24.633 --> 01:50:28.336]  You've got to not go under learned helplessness and Stockholm syndrome.
[01:50:28.857 --> 01:50:30.058]  And you have to understand that
[01:50:31.192 --> 01:50:35.196]  You can take them to Operation Lockstep and Operation Event 201.
[01:50:35.597 --> 01:50:44.006]  Print those out for your family and say, here's the Rockefellers calling it a pandemic to bring in world government and a worldwide police state in their words.
[01:50:45.462 --> 01:50:50.566]  And so they have to have the source documents of the conspiracy, because it sounds like your family are nice people.
[01:50:50.926 --> 01:51:02.655]  They project their empathy and their overall goodness, but their simplicity and their ignorance, not stupidity, but simplicity, naivete, on to the rest of the world.
[01:51:03.095 --> 01:51:07.819]  And no, your family just want to run a barber shop and take care of kids and be happy people.
[01:51:08.599 --> 01:51:10.960]  They don't have that criminal lust of globalists.
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.721]  You have to read the criminal lust of the enemy to know their blueprint.
[01:51:13.941 --> 01:51:14.461]  We love you, Andy.
[01:51:14.481 --> 01:51:15.261]  Good to have you on board.
[01:51:15.601 --> 01:51:16.181]  Amazing call.
[01:51:16.221 --> 01:51:21.843]  More calls straight ahead from Steven, Paul, Black Lightning, CC, Jeff, Patrick, and Gio.
[01:51:21.863 --> 01:51:22.683]  We'll get to every one of you.
[01:51:22.963 --> 01:51:23.343]  Stay with us.
[01:51:24.464 --> 01:51:30.285]  That's what happens to tyrants throughout history is they get overconfident and they keep squeezing people until there's resistance.
[01:51:30.545 --> 01:51:32.126]  And we've got so much production
[01:51:34.458 --> 01:51:41.441]  And so much food, so much everything, they're able to then steal all the basic freedom, but because people still have food, they tend to not rebel.
[01:51:42.961 --> 01:51:59.307]  But then when the cult tries to take control of your mind and your children and put a muzzle on you and totally take control of your life, the resistance forms, the enemy begins to try to intimidate, thinking that, oh, the population was laying down because they were scared of us.
[01:51:59.628 --> 01:52:00.488]  No, we were asleep.
[01:52:02.574 --> 01:52:11.196]  And so because these globalists themselves, these satanists are cowards, they treat us like they would act.
[01:52:13.197 --> 01:52:15.958]  And then they try to attack us and they hurt us and they kill some of us.
[01:52:16.918 --> 01:52:20.599]  And they maim other people and they humiliate us and all it does is make people's blood boil.
[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:27.021]  And I know that is a diabolical laugh, but it's really...
[01:52:28.072 --> 01:52:28.993]  I'm a diabolical person.
[01:52:29.433 --> 01:52:30.994]  So, in a good way.
[01:52:31.795 --> 01:52:34.977]  And I'm not gonna fake a nice friendly laugh for you.
[01:52:35.077 --> 01:52:44.543]  These Satanists are gonna pay bad.
[01:52:45.183 --> 01:52:45.844]  So I'm gonna stop now.
[01:52:48.345 --> 01:52:50.026]  See, I'm a sinner, folks.
[01:52:50.326 --> 01:52:51.367]  I try to be Christian.
[01:52:52.668 --> 01:52:53.288]  Try to be good.
[01:52:53.608 --> 01:52:54.709]  I'm gonna be good.
[01:52:54.729 --> 01:52:56.790]  I just don't like you people.
[01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:58.291]  I don't like you child molesters.
[01:52:58.571 --> 01:53:05.475]  I just want you to know... You're gonna burn, you understand that?
[01:53:06.336 --> 01:53:14.701]  So... Gotta keep our horsepower under control, though.
[01:53:18.114 --> 01:53:20.175]  We're going to kick the living hell out of these people.
[01:53:21.956 --> 01:53:25.179]  The problem is it's going to get a lot worse before the general public finally wakes up, but they will.
[01:53:25.199 --> 01:53:28.941]  And it's going to be too late for all the new world order.
[01:53:29.962 --> 01:53:36.826]  And all the king's horses and all the king's men will never be able to put them back together again.
[01:53:38.147 --> 01:53:40.629]  And so they want to mutate us and kill us and poison us?
[01:53:41.729 --> 01:53:45.492]  Oh, you're going to go into the fire you built for us.
[01:53:46.650 --> 01:53:47.330]  Not the other way around.
[01:53:47.370 --> 01:53:48.891]  Okay, I'm going to hurry up and go to all your calls.
[01:53:48.951 --> 01:53:51.052]  I got some breaking news before I hand it over to Dr. Nick Baggett.
[01:53:51.132 --> 01:53:52.073]  I'm going to start the next hour.
[01:53:52.833 --> 01:53:54.214]  Really important stuff breaking right now.
[01:53:55.975 --> 01:53:56.895]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:53:56.915 --> 01:53:57.556]  Let me see here.
[01:54:00.177 --> 01:54:01.377]  These really are epic times we're in.
[01:54:03.058 --> 01:54:04.659]  Let's go to Black Lightning.
[01:54:04.679 --> 01:54:05.680]  Black Lightning in Florida.
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:06.240]  Thanks for calling.
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:06.760]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:07.901 --> 01:54:08.101]  Yes.
[01:54:08.141 --> 01:54:09.722]  Hey, God bless you, Alex.
[01:54:09.922 --> 01:54:11.062]  Thanks a lot for taking my call.
[01:54:12.819 --> 01:54:18.202]  You know, I heard one of your last callers, you know, talking about the strength of numbers, and I totally agree.
[01:54:18.802 --> 01:54:30.889]  And, you know, it's been on my mind, I've been trying to get through, why can't we just do class actions and sue, you know, Soros and the Gates and the Clintons and all the bankers for... Because they control the judges and they won't do jack crap.
[01:54:33.271 --> 01:54:35.173]  The courts by and large are controlled, that's the problem.
[01:54:35.233 --> 01:54:42.382]  It's starting to change a little bit, like with the Snowden ruling, but most of these judges are scared, and they shoot and kill judges all the time, the globalists do.
[01:54:42.643 --> 01:54:48.330]  They'll just hire some mafia operative, you know, some MS-13 person to go kill them at their house.
[01:54:49.121 --> 01:54:52.723]  I mean, judges get shot all the time, and the judges are cowards, on average.
[01:54:53.404 --> 01:54:57.867]  There's some good ones, but when they're faced with what's really going on, they tend to piss themselves.
[01:54:58.387 --> 01:54:59.828]  And so many people are blackmailed.
[01:54:59.848 --> 01:55:03.330]  You know, if somebody blackmailed me with something real, I'd just come clean.
[01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:05.591]  But there's nothing really I'm ashamed of or trying to hide.
[01:55:06.012 --> 01:55:10.254]  They try to manufacture stuff, but I mean, you know they're blackmailing a couple members of the Supreme Court, right?
[01:55:10.274 --> 01:55:13.216]  I mean, you know they're blackmailing Governor Abbott, right?
[01:55:13.236 --> 01:55:14.357]  Yes.
[01:55:16.224 --> 01:55:23.007]  I mean, I know how they're blackmailing him, and I'm just sitting here going, okay, it's not even that bad.
[01:55:24.307 --> 01:55:28.769]  But it's again, he's even afraid of impropriety being brought out about him.
[01:55:30.230 --> 01:55:37.093]  So his fault is letting them blackmail him, not what they say he did.
[01:55:37.213 --> 01:55:37.493]  Go ahead.
[01:55:39.045 --> 01:55:41.566]  Well, again, the strength in numbers.
[01:55:41.646 --> 01:55:42.746]  It comes right back to that again.
[01:55:42.786 --> 01:55:57.072]  These people that are in power and have all these legal things at their fingertips, and if they're not going to abide by the law or the Constitution, then I say, in the end, or now, give me the names and the addresses so we know what doors to knock on.
[01:55:57.092 --> 01:56:00.513]  I hear you, brother.
[01:56:00.533 --> 01:56:01.554]  What else do you think we should do?
[01:56:01.574 --> 01:56:02.374]  Because I'm getting pissed.
[01:56:02.974 --> 01:56:05.015]  And by the way, it's with a heavy heart I say this.
[01:56:05.415 --> 01:56:06.676]  I ran into a business person
[01:56:08.052 --> 01:56:14.905]  Well-to-do, very well-known in Texas 10 years ago, and I said, I really like, you know, Abbott when he was running for governor or whatever.
[01:56:15.888 --> 01:56:16.548]  It was right before he did.
[01:56:16.568 --> 01:56:19.349]  And they said, well, they told me some stuff about Abbott.
[01:56:19.389 --> 01:56:26.392]  And then later I talked to somebody who was connected to something totally separate in San Antonio, in the San Antonio City Council.
[01:56:27.192 --> 01:56:30.913]  And they told me, well, you know, they've got stuff on Abbott, on some deals he did.
[01:56:30.933 --> 01:56:32.214]  And then they told me the names of the people.
[01:56:32.234 --> 01:56:34.475]  And I'm like, well, that's two prominent people told me this.
[01:56:35.195 --> 01:56:37.055]  And so then I talked to another person.
[01:56:37.075 --> 01:56:38.896]  They said, well, yeah, how do you know that information?
[01:56:40.037 --> 01:56:43.538]  That's closely held information, but it's known at certain levels of the legislature
[01:56:44.558 --> 01:56:44.698]  Amen.
[01:57:16.544 --> 01:57:20.166]  Sounds like the name of a cool drink or something, or like a super cool water slide.
[01:57:20.206 --> 01:57:21.627]  Black Lightning.
[01:57:22.787 --> 01:57:23.288]  Let's go ahead.
[01:57:23.308 --> 01:57:25.029]  Somebody said it was racist, so she can't have it.
[01:57:25.809 --> 01:57:29.871]  Everything black sounds cool, like a black Cadillac.
[01:57:30.071 --> 01:57:32.473]  Sounds cooler than a red Cadillac, doesn't it?
[01:57:33.613 --> 01:57:34.874]  Let's go to Steve in West Virginia.
[01:57:34.894 --> 01:57:35.594]  Steve, thanks for holding.
[01:57:35.614 --> 01:57:35.974]  Go ahead.
[01:57:37.495 --> 01:57:44.239]  Alex, the blood is boiling in the human collective consciousness.
[01:57:44.559 --> 01:57:45.940]  I sure as hell know mine is, brother.
[01:57:46.781 --> 01:57:47.281]  Oh my God.
[01:57:47.301 --> 01:57:48.922]  In fact, that's why I'm laughing like a demon.
[01:57:49.002 --> 01:57:49.942]  I mean, I'm boiling.
[01:57:50.082 --> 01:57:53.464]  That's like, I mean, I'm boiling, yeah.
[01:57:53.864 --> 01:57:59.386]  Every man that I've talked to in this area is feeling the exact same way.
[01:57:59.786 --> 01:58:02.207]  We can't help it because we're under attack.
[01:58:02.887 --> 01:58:15.392]  So, my idea that I wanted to put out to you is that you have the connections and you have the inside knowledge that the average civilian doesn't have.
[01:58:16.072 --> 01:58:18.697]  But you also have the IMPOR's army.
[01:58:19.478 --> 01:58:21.222]  And if you call us up, sir...
[01:58:22.341 --> 01:58:27.563]  We will come together, wherever we need to, and put the fear of God in these people.
[01:58:27.583 --> 01:58:30.864]  Brother, I understand that's why they want us off air, is they're afraid I'm going to do certain things.
[01:58:31.004 --> 01:58:31.724]  What are those things?
[01:58:31.784 --> 01:58:32.204]  I don't know.
[01:58:32.504 --> 01:58:37.586]  We can have rallies, we can go out and do stuff, I can go bowling in the White House, the President actually hears about it, does stuff.
[01:58:37.626 --> 01:58:48.310]  I mean, we should have a whole big show, we should have a bunch of shows, a summit of programs, a telethon for 10 hours straight some night, or some day.
[01:58:49.349 --> 01:58:49.949]  Maybe tomorrow.
[01:58:50.730 --> 01:58:59.176]  I'm coming in two to four to do a two-hour show, where we just have a big brainstorm about what do we do, because that's all I keep thinking, is what should we do?
[01:58:59.216 --> 01:58:59.796]  What should I do?
[01:58:59.816 --> 01:59:01.177]  What do you think we should do, Steve?
[01:59:02.518 --> 01:59:07.701]  What has to happen is Alex Jones has to get out from behind the desk, as much as I hate to say it.
[01:59:08.182 --> 01:59:09.963]  Put David Knight in charge for now.
[01:59:10.383 --> 01:59:12.785]  He's a rock star, him and Owen both.
[01:59:13.525 --> 01:59:17.428]  Get out there and tell, listen, InfoWars Army.
[01:59:17.938 --> 01:59:19.459]  You all can hear me right now.
[01:59:19.899 --> 01:59:24.002]  We have to get behind General Alex Jones.
[01:59:24.162 --> 01:59:26.224]  But I'm asking you, what do we do?
[01:59:26.364 --> 01:59:27.024]  What do we do?
[01:59:27.204 --> 01:59:27.765]  I'm asking you.
[01:59:27.825 --> 01:59:29.866]  I mean, go surround the White House and bullhorn them forever?
[01:59:31.207 --> 01:59:37.271]  I've done a bunch of marches to open things back up and gone out and confronted Andy Foote and our crew has all over the country.
[01:59:37.291 --> 01:59:38.372]  I mean, we're a small organization.
[01:59:38.792 --> 01:59:40.273]  I know we have listeners everywhere that are awesome.
[01:59:40.353 --> 01:59:41.074]  What do we do?
[01:59:41.094 --> 01:59:42.575]  I'm saying we've got to have a mission.
[01:59:44.273 --> 01:59:52.621]  The last caller was saying that we have power in numbers, and the globalists aren't afraid of us because they don't really know how many of us there are.
[01:59:53.002 --> 02:00:02.271]  So we have to gather in mass in one spot, maybe once a month or not that much, but we have to gather and show them what they're really up against.
[02:00:02.752 --> 02:00:04.694]  Hey brother, brother, I disagree with you.
[02:00:04.714 --> 02:00:06.356]  I'm not saying you're wrong overall.
[02:00:09.335 --> 02:00:11.116]  The globalists have all this surveillance.
[02:00:11.156 --> 02:00:12.896]  They know the Liberty Movement worldwide is giant.
[02:00:13.177 --> 02:00:16.418]  They know the Patriot Movement, the anti-globalist movement is their main opposition.
[02:00:16.458 --> 02:00:20.139]  They admit in white papers that they're in deep trouble and don't know how they're ever going to defeat nationalism.
[02:00:20.879 --> 02:00:22.300]  That's why they're making their move with the UN.
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:25.181]  So they can ignore big rallies.
[02:00:25.221 --> 02:00:26.061]  Rallies aren't bad.
[02:00:26.081 --> 02:00:27.562]  We need more than that.
[02:00:27.622 --> 02:00:32.984]  We need... They've stopped doing live TV shows because four years ago our listeners took over all the live TV shows.
[02:00:33.544 --> 02:00:34.585]  And I'm going to do it again this year.
[02:00:35.476 --> 02:00:36.977]  Believe me, I hear what you're saying.
[02:00:36.997 --> 02:00:38.158]  The answer is this audience.
[02:00:38.499 --> 02:00:39.059]  They're the army.
[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:39.980]  They're everything.
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:42.622]  I'm just a regular private in that army as well.
[02:00:43.323 --> 02:00:45.865]  We have to collectively come up with the idea of what we're going to do.
[02:00:45.885 --> 02:00:46.446]  Thank you, Steve.
[02:00:46.866 --> 02:00:47.787]  Alright, more calls.
[02:00:47.847 --> 02:00:48.828]  CeCe, you're up next.
[02:00:48.868 --> 02:00:49.348]  Stay with us.
[02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:50.549]  InfoWars.com.
[02:00:53.011 --> 02:00:56.374]  We are back live on this Friday transmission.
[02:00:57.455 --> 02:00:58.836]  This is just out of the Gateway Pundit.
[02:00:58.896 --> 02:01:00.798]  We'll have it posted to InfoWars.com.
[02:01:01.379 --> 02:01:02.780]  GatewayPundit.com, very important article.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:13.944]  Creepy Bill Gates invests $250 million into media so he gets better coverage of his multiple-dose Corona vaccine he wants to give every person on the planet.
[02:01:13.984 --> 02:01:22.447]  How it works is he gives his tax-exempt money to companies and then they pay money back into his company.
[02:01:22.467 --> 02:01:25.628]  So that's how he does tax exemption and basically pays no tax.
[02:01:25.708 --> 02:01:26.728]  It's all a giant fraud.
[02:01:27.269 --> 02:01:29.169]  Only a few other globalists are allowed to do this.
[02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.910]  No one else is.
[02:01:30.930 --> 02:01:32.250]  You'd be arrested if you tried this.
[02:01:33.211 --> 02:01:33.371]  But
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:37.122]  The headline's important, but it's not all the story.
[02:01:37.462 --> 02:01:39.103]  It's an accurate headline, but it's not all the story.
[02:01:40.424 --> 02:01:45.327]  Gates spends b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b
[02:02:01.089 --> 02:02:04.971]  The UN just came out two days ago and said, a bunch of people got polio from our vaccine.
[02:02:05.431 --> 02:02:06.571]  And then it was a Bill Gates vaccine.
[02:02:06.871 --> 02:02:08.292]  They told on themselves.
[02:02:08.652 --> 02:02:09.533]  It's a new thing they did.
[02:02:10.873 --> 02:02:12.394]  Everyone's starving because of COVID.
[02:02:12.634 --> 02:02:14.335]  No, it's starving because of your fake lockdown.
[02:02:15.595 --> 02:02:24.099]  So the real story, the headline should be, Bill Gates pays $250 million to election metal and run numbers about horrible COVID death if you don't take a shot.
[02:02:24.459 --> 02:02:26.540]  This is for ads, they admit.
[02:02:27.955 --> 02:02:30.597]  Saying we're all dead, COVID's deadly if we don't take the shot.
[02:02:30.717 --> 02:02:32.459]  It's the bolster of the hysteria.
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.381]  He spent billions in U.S.
[02:02:35.421 --> 02:02:35.721]  media.
[02:02:35.761 --> 02:02:39.865]  You know CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, the Sunday news shows.
[02:02:40.385 --> 02:02:43.828]  A lot of times at the end will say underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:02:45.389 --> 02:02:47.771]  Underwritten by the Rockefeller Foundation, like PBS.
[02:02:49.172 --> 02:02:50.053]  And he goes on there.
[02:02:51.710 --> 02:02:56.213]  And tells you, you're gonna take the shot, I'm your doctor, when he's a eugenicist.
[02:02:56.313 --> 02:03:06.018]  I mean, if there was a guy on the neighborhood who was a convicted child molester, and he came and wanted to babysit your 8-year-old daughter, you'd say, get off my porch, I'm gonna kick your ass.
[02:03:07.439 --> 02:03:08.760]  If he knew he was a convicted child molester.
[02:03:10.101 --> 02:03:15.584]  If he was like a 6-year-old man and looked creepy, you'd say, no, that's weird, you're not a babysitter, you're not a 14-year-old young lady.
[02:03:17.213 --> 02:03:19.654]  You don't have local babysitters that are six-year-old men.
[02:03:20.294 --> 02:03:35.337]  Well, he's a 60-something-year-old guy that's not a doctor whose dad ran Planned Parenthood, who's into depopulation and eugenics, saying he wants to depopulate everybody, and he's busy spending billions of dollars doing all this, and then now he wants to make you take something, and said the lockdown will never end!
[02:03:35.477 --> 02:03:36.697]  It's ridiculous!
[02:03:36.717 --> 02:03:38.798]  He wants in your body!
[02:03:39.038 --> 02:03:40.158]  He's a serial killer!
[02:03:40.598 --> 02:03:41.858]  He's a crazy pervert!
[02:03:43.799 --> 02:03:44.699]  He's a rapist!
[02:03:45.762 --> 02:03:49.383]  We have t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com that say Arrest Bill Gates on the front.
[02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:55.584]  And on the back, we say Mask Free Zone InfoWars.com.
[02:03:56.184 --> 02:04:01.826]  Get your shirts at InfoWarsTore.com and when you gotta go on the airplane, wear that shirt.
[02:04:02.906 --> 02:04:06.087]  You gotta go in some store and they make you do it or whatever, you're gonna wear it!
[02:04:06.267 --> 02:04:06.867]  Expose them!
[02:04:09.207 --> 02:04:10.268]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[02:04:10.648 --> 02:04:11.668]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:17.129]  The shirts, I designed them two weeks ago, Kimball Design, and they're here now.
[02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:18.910]  They just got here, so I'm going to get some today.
[02:04:18.930 --> 02:04:19.851]  I'll be wearing some out.
[02:04:20.351 --> 02:04:22.833]  I cannot wait to wear that out in public.
[02:04:22.893 --> 02:04:25.135]  I cannot wait to fight back in the third dimension.
[02:04:25.275 --> 02:04:26.196]  People say, well, you're a hypocrite.
[02:04:26.536 --> 02:04:28.258]  You say the mask are a fraud, but you sell masks.
[02:04:28.338 --> 02:04:31.640]  If you've got to wear one on an airplane, sometimes you've got to do it.
[02:04:32.021 --> 02:04:33.542]  Wear it with InfoWars.com.
[02:04:33.562 --> 02:04:35.564]  That's not contradictory.
[02:04:37.705 --> 02:04:38.326]  That means
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:48.324]  I don't want to use a gross analogy, but if some rapist put a gun to a woman's head and said, I'm going to blow your head off if you don't give me oral sex, well, bite it off.
[02:04:49.104 --> 02:04:52.686]  My point is that we have to not submit anymore.
[02:04:54.567 --> 02:04:55.848]  Arrest Fauci and Gates.
[02:04:56.088 --> 02:04:58.329]  We've got another version that says arrest Bill Gates.
[02:04:58.369 --> 02:04:59.270]  And then look at the back.
[02:05:01.131 --> 02:05:01.931]  Mass-free zone.
[02:05:01.951 --> 02:05:03.292]  I guess the other version says Infowars.
[02:05:04.212 --> 02:05:07.054]  We've got the Baby Lives Matter shirts.
[02:05:07.074 --> 02:05:08.715]  I'm coming out with an American Lives Matter shirt.
[02:05:09.633 --> 02:05:11.814]  And it gets the word out, it fights back, and it funds the operation.
[02:05:12.094 --> 02:05:12.975]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[02:05:12.995 --> 02:05:13.575]  Appreciate you holding.
[02:05:14.575 --> 02:05:16.316]  Let's go ahead and go to CC in Washington.
[02:05:16.356 --> 02:05:17.037]  Go ahead and welcome.
[02:05:18.077 --> 02:05:18.317]  Hi.
[02:05:18.598 --> 02:05:18.998]  Hi, Alex.
[02:05:19.018 --> 02:05:19.618]  How are you doing?
[02:05:20.438 --> 02:05:24.821]  I'm from Seattle, and this is a call about the elections.
[02:05:24.941 --> 02:05:32.224]  Our homeless population varies, but it's estimated to be about 12,000 people.
[02:05:33.105 --> 02:05:35.186]  And I got curious about
[02:05:36.328 --> 02:05:38.889]  How many ballots were going to homeless shelters?
[02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:44.312]  So I wrote to the King County elections and they gave me some numbers.
[02:05:44.392 --> 02:05:49.234]  And so now I'm working with the state elections.
[02:05:49.394 --> 02:05:55.397]  But there was one homeless shelter whose name I won't mention was receiving 545 ballots and 36 were returned.
[02:05:55.477 --> 02:05:57.438]  So I just wanted to call in and
[02:06:04.756 --> 02:06:10.938]  Encourage people to, in their district, to check with their, you know, election registry.
[02:06:11.058 --> 02:06:12.198]  That is a great idea.
[02:06:12.318 --> 02:06:18.000]  Everyone should go volunteer to be an elections monitor so we have on-the-ground intel in 59 days.
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:25.602]  And the place that doesn't want you to be there, that's who you've got to organize with neighbors and friends and family to really get in there and infiltrate what they're doing.
[02:06:27.512 --> 02:06:41.575]  Yeah, because we were just concerned in the state, and this was for the primary election, which wasn't maybe necessarily a high-value election, but there was some talk about ballot harvesting in prior elections.
[02:06:42.035 --> 02:06:43.496]  Oh, we know they're doing it.
[02:06:43.936 --> 02:06:44.736]  What do you think's going to happen?
[02:06:44.756 --> 02:06:46.296]  The Democrats say they're going to contest it.
[02:06:46.336 --> 02:06:47.156]  They know they're losing.
[02:06:48.357 --> 02:06:49.657]  How do we counter something like this?
[02:06:52.271 --> 02:07:02.198]  Um, I have been hearing all the stuff about, you know, Biden's just going to, they've said that, you know, oh yes, Trump will win at first, but then with the mail-in ballots, we'll win.
[02:07:02.858 --> 02:07:03.219]  I don't know.
[02:07:03.259 --> 02:07:06.261]  It just sounds like there's going to be a lot of court battles over this.
[02:07:06.321 --> 02:07:07.682]  That's exactly what happens.
[02:07:07.802 --> 02:07:09.903]  And under the Constitution, those are still going on.
[02:07:10.443 --> 02:07:13.465]  January 20th, Trump and Pence leave the White House.
[02:07:13.485 --> 02:07:15.187]  Well, that's all fraud.
[02:07:15.227 --> 02:07:16.447]  So we just let them do this?
[02:07:16.467 --> 02:07:17.908]  No, we've got to have a plan up front.
[02:07:17.928 --> 02:07:19.690]  Thank you so much for holding, Cece.
[02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:20.210]  You're awesome.
[02:07:22.876 --> 02:07:27.297]  Up next is Jeff in Canada.
[02:07:27.337 --> 02:07:28.057]  Jeff, thanks for holding.
[02:07:30.698 --> 02:07:32.458]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:32.918]  Thank you, sir.
[02:07:33.898 --> 02:07:42.480]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know about the lunacy level in Canada here on the Canada COVID recommendations website.
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:43.481]  I'll just read you this.
[02:07:43.541 --> 02:07:44.481]  It's just five lines.
[02:07:45.161 --> 02:07:49.022]  Choose sexual positions that limit face-to-face contact.
[02:07:49.522 --> 02:07:50.022]  Wear a mask.
[02:07:50.874 --> 02:07:58.516]  And then it says, use barriers like, example, glory holes that allow for sexual contact to prevent close face-to-face contact.
[02:07:58.556 --> 02:07:59.216]  No, I saw that.
[02:07:59.236 --> 02:08:03.237]  You're supposed to go to like, public sex places, the most dangerous things ever.
[02:08:03.657 --> 02:08:06.598]  It's all dehumanization, it's all degeneracy, it's all a joke.
[02:08:06.978 --> 02:08:09.939]  I saw that a month ago put out by the health departments, yeah.
[02:08:11.679 --> 02:08:15.880]  Yeah, like, we're at the level where they're telling us to have sex with a piece of plywood in between us.
[02:08:16.581 --> 02:08:17.621]  That's the level at that.
[02:08:18.792 --> 02:08:23.295]  I just wanted to say that because what they're trying to do is really inject fear.
[02:08:24.276 --> 02:08:28.198]  And, you know, a wise man once said, we have nothing to fear but fear itself.
[02:08:29.499 --> 02:08:30.360]  I totally agree.
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:35.043]  And it's so obvious that it's all based on, not just Overblown, we're talking 100, 200, 400.
[02:08:35.423 --> 02:08:40.667]  I mean, the level of exaggeration is off the charts.
[02:08:41.367 --> 02:08:43.148]  The level of lying is incredible.
[02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:46.050]  Exactly.
[02:08:46.130 --> 02:08:48.392]  So I've got a solution I want to submit to you.
[02:08:49.581 --> 02:08:54.523]  Of how we can actually, practically defeat the COVID farce.
[02:08:55.183 --> 02:08:55.903]  Tell me.
[02:08:55.923 --> 02:08:57.184]  And it goes like this.
[02:08:59.345 --> 02:09:03.766]  Everybody that's phoned in today has got a piece of what I'm about to say.
[02:09:04.567 --> 02:09:05.487]  But it's this, Alex.
[02:09:06.987 --> 02:09:12.289]  The hoax can be defeated by the actual cure for the real part of the disease.
[02:09:14.795 --> 02:09:26.239]  Therapeutic narrative has been suppressed, and even when doctors stand up and say, we've got a cure that works, it's been suppressed by the big tech media.
[02:09:26.559 --> 02:09:31.261]  What shows that's what they fear is people getting educated about therapeutics, yes.
[02:09:32.501 --> 02:09:33.021]  Exactly.
[02:09:33.281 --> 02:09:36.522]  So here's my suggestion, and I will submit this to you.
[02:09:37.903 --> 02:09:44.365]  What if, and you don't have to leave the office for this, but what if you direct your staff to print out fact sheets
[02:09:45.023 --> 02:09:45.703]  That's good.
[02:10:02.426 --> 02:10:05.688]  And we'll literally have thousands and thousands, hopefully millions of people.
[02:10:05.908 --> 02:10:10.330]  You are, you are, you are 100% correct and I've said everybody should have fact sheets.
[02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:16.753]  It's up to us to create a data center that just has basic factoids, CDC says 90% fake positives.
[02:10:17.593 --> 02:10:20.514]  You know, most of them hospital deaths of old people.
[02:10:21.955 --> 02:10:27.878]  NIH says you must have vitamin C and D3 or you will die in zinc.
[02:10:28.418 --> 02:10:30.019]  And then show this is all preventable.
[02:10:30.859 --> 02:10:37.902]  That anyone will die that doesn't have these three vitamins and minerals and then have that on a nice print off on a site that does it.
[02:10:37.982 --> 02:10:40.143]  I mean, that's what Mercola is doing with his D3 initiative.
[02:10:40.563 --> 02:10:41.623]  That's why we had him on and promoted it.
[02:10:41.643 --> 02:10:42.423]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:10:42.864 --> 02:10:54.088]  I need to consult with some doctors and get them to prepare it so that we can even say we had a medical doctor prepare it and then just turn the public loose to go into grocery stores and everywhere and just print them off.
[02:10:54.728 --> 02:10:58.789]  And I'm telling you, for like 50 bucks, you could put out thousands of these.
[02:10:58.809 --> 02:11:04.130]  And if we just get excited and do it, and litter them everywhere, it will absolutely change the world.
[02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:05.511]  And have a message.
[02:11:05.571 --> 02:11:06.711]  It's your job to save people.
[02:11:07.171 --> 02:11:07.791]  It's your mission.
[02:11:08.611 --> 02:11:09.632]  The fall and winter is coming.
[02:11:10.172 --> 02:11:13.733]  They want to have a half million dead because people don't have their vitamins and minerals.
[02:11:14.053 --> 02:11:14.933]  It's our job to do it.
[02:11:15.013 --> 02:11:15.813]  Beautifully said.
[02:11:15.853 --> 02:11:16.793]  Thank you so much, Jeff.
[02:11:17.873 --> 02:11:24.055]  We need to take that and run that as a promo, and I commit to you that by next Tuesday, we're going to have that up and we're going to do it.
[02:11:27.244 --> 02:11:30.645]  This is going to come down to sight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:11:30.665 --> 02:11:31.826]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:11:31.846 --> 02:11:33.246]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:11:33.566 --> 02:11:34.947]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:11:35.047 --> 02:11:36.087]  I want them shut down.
[02:11:36.147 --> 02:11:37.027]  I want them silenced.
[02:11:37.107 --> 02:11:37.808]  I want them muted.
[02:11:37.828 --> 02:11:39.708]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:11:39.748 --> 02:11:40.689]  You kept us on air.
[02:11:40.809 --> 02:11:42.109]  We did the analysis first.
[02:11:42.389 --> 02:11:43.369]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:11:43.429 --> 02:11:45.250]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:51.392]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:11:51.632 --> 02:11:53.073]  And you need to stop right now.
[02:11:53.173 --> 02:11:54.233]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:11:54.393 --> 02:11:56.794]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil worshiping child molesters.
[02:11:56.954 --> 02:11:57.674]  This is not going to happen.
[02:11:57.694 --> 02:11:59.596]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[02:12:00.056 --> 02:12:02.517]  I used to say support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[02:12:02.597 --> 02:12:04.238]  Save yourself, save the world.
[02:12:04.558 --> 02:12:05.419]  We're in this together.
[02:12:05.519 --> 02:12:07.200]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:11.322]  Communism's up here, InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[02:12:11.703 --> 02:12:13.544]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:12:13.744 --> 02:12:15.285]  My children are right here!
[02:12:16.025 --> 02:12:17.766]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:12:17.966 --> 02:12:19.027]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:12:19.247 --> 02:12:20.127]  And I need prayer!
[02:12:20.348 --> 02:12:21.228]  And I need action!
[02:12:21.628 --> 02:12:23.209]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:25.871]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[02:12:26.491 --> 02:12:26.911]  Woo!
[02:12:27.291 --> 02:12:29.432]  We are into the fourth hour.
[02:12:31.573 --> 02:12:35.715]  And I was going to air a special report next segment before baggage comes on, but I want to finish with your calls.
[02:12:35.775 --> 02:12:39.576]  So, if you want to see that report, it's up at Band.Video.
[02:12:39.596 --> 02:12:45.479]  You can't share that link on Twitter, so you want to go to 2020ElectionCenter.com.
[02:12:46.239 --> 02:12:47.220]  2020ElectionCenter.com.
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:48.660]  Oh, I just coughed.
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:53.402]  Under Ohio rules, I could be taken to a prison facility for one month for an observation.
[02:12:53.502 --> 02:12:55.303]  I was seen to be coughing.
[02:12:56.564 --> 02:12:59.606]  It's not because I ate a jalapeno earlier and a little bit of pizza at the back of my throat.
[02:12:59.666 --> 02:13:01.988]  No, it's because I'm a COVID criminal.
[02:13:02.889 --> 02:13:05.511]  Let's go back to your calls here and the order they were received.
[02:13:05.531 --> 02:13:06.452]  Very thankful for your calls.
[02:13:06.872 --> 02:13:13.317]  Paul in Denver, Colorado, once great red state, now as blue as the bluest sky.
[02:13:13.337 --> 02:13:14.658]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:13:15.859 --> 02:13:18.161]  Hey, I have a story similar to Colorado House.
[02:13:18.181 --> 02:13:23.084]  I was down at the protest May 30th, the third day of the protest down here.
[02:13:23.184 --> 02:13:23.805]  I got attacked.
[02:13:24.854 --> 02:13:26.095]  Um, by some people that know me.
[02:13:26.115 --> 02:13:30.538]  It was based off the smear campaign that left people like- But, but Nadler said there's no antifa, sir.
[02:13:31.519 --> 02:13:32.379]  Oh, no, there's not.
[02:13:32.419 --> 02:13:33.260]  No, yeah, I was lying.
[02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:35.881]  So you were, you were attacked by Casper the Friendly Ghost?
[02:13:36.562 --> 02:13:37.362]  Right, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:37.442 --> 02:13:41.105]  I was picked up by a hind and sent to the ground by nothing when I defended myself.
[02:13:41.345 --> 02:13:45.127]  Um, basically I got charged with second degree assault and sent to jail.
[02:13:45.528 --> 02:13:46.448]  Um, which was awesome.
[02:13:47.089 --> 02:13:50.491]  But it, it was- Oh, for being assaulted by the lordships that don't exist?
[02:13:51.331 --> 02:13:52.172]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:52.192 --> 02:13:53.873]  Uh, yeah, it was awesome.
[02:13:55.608 --> 02:14:02.250]  What I'm thinking is that we just need to educate people more than we need to go out there.
[02:14:03.271 --> 02:14:11.673]  Maybe a show of force is important, but I think they'll quash it pretty fast because they won't do anything about what's going on with people's businesses and stuff.
[02:14:12.553 --> 02:14:16.675]  I think just educating your fellow friends, just telling them what you know, if that's a fact.
[02:14:17.175 --> 02:14:18.355]  And I'm saying, you know where I learned this?
[02:14:18.535 --> 02:14:19.896]  I learned it from Pitfall Warriors, Alex Jones.
[02:14:19.996 --> 02:14:20.496]  They're like, what?
[02:14:21.563 --> 02:14:25.366]  Oh yeah, folks, the word of mouth about whatever media you think is telling the best truth.
[02:14:25.866 --> 02:14:29.329]  InfoWars, Tucker Carlson, you know, Gateway Punished is doing a great job.
[02:14:29.649 --> 02:14:34.652]  Promote the outlets that are telling the truth, and they're the most successful at telling the truth, and then that's it.
[02:14:34.672 --> 02:14:35.433]  That's all you gotta do.
[02:14:36.714 --> 02:14:37.394]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:37.474 --> 02:14:39.816]  I'm the Antifa Denver Butcher.
[02:14:40.176 --> 02:14:42.658]  The Denver Antifa Butcher, as I call myself.
[02:14:42.678 --> 02:14:45.020]  So I'm going to take the good fight to
[02:14:46.001 --> 02:14:51.383]  What do you make of this scumbag not being in the military, lying about it.
[02:14:52.744 --> 02:14:54.745]  His sister said she's not sad he's dead.
[02:14:54.805 --> 02:14:56.006]  That's how bad a person he was.
[02:14:56.866 --> 02:14:59.487]  And then he pulled a gun on the feds and got killed.
[02:14:59.547 --> 02:15:01.148]  I mean this is a sack of garbage.
[02:15:01.728 --> 02:15:03.409]  Nothing but a lying machine.
[02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:06.991]  Yeah, yeah, these people have no beliefs.
[02:15:07.011 --> 02:15:07.952]  They'll never tell the truth.
[02:15:08.813 --> 02:15:09.673]  He's on video!
[02:15:09.753 --> 02:15:11.414]  They're going, pull it, pull it!
[02:15:11.434 --> 02:15:12.015]  Get him, get him!
[02:15:12.275 --> 02:15:14.216]  They shoot him in cold blood in front of all these witnesses!
[02:15:14.536 --> 02:15:16.978]  And they go, oh, he was attacking a person of color!
[02:15:17.198 --> 02:15:18.018]  That's why I killed him!
[02:15:18.299 --> 02:15:18.559]  No!
[02:15:18.879 --> 02:15:19.599]  You're a liar!
[02:15:19.839 --> 02:15:20.380]  And you're dead!
[02:15:21.513 --> 02:15:23.254]  Look, it was white people that attacked me.
[02:15:23.274 --> 02:15:25.716]  It was a bunch of white, wannabe Antifa kids who attacked me.
[02:15:26.076 --> 02:15:28.278]  A brown person over lies.
[02:15:28.498 --> 02:15:31.059]  They want to be the cops without due process.
[02:15:31.099 --> 02:15:31.800]  They want to kill me.
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:34.402]  And when it doesn't work, they send the cops after me.
[02:15:35.122 --> 02:15:38.044]  Well, I was about to say, they act like the worst cops you could imagine.
[02:15:38.524 --> 02:15:41.386]  They act like what they say bad cops are.
[02:15:41.947 --> 02:15:46.970]  I mean, if cops were randomly setting up checkpoints and shooting citizens in the head, I'd say go to war with them.
[02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:47.671]  They're not!
[02:15:48.671 --> 02:15:50.732]  It's Antifa doing it everywhere, to us!
[02:15:50.992 --> 02:15:52.452]  They've done it to us, brother!
[02:15:52.472 --> 02:15:55.973]  I don't have to watch it on the news, they do it to us!
[02:15:55.993 --> 02:16:03.356]  I was watching a clip of yours, this is a little bit unrelated, but you were talking about reconducting with the world and nature.
[02:16:03.376 --> 02:16:06.737]  You're out there in the forest, your shirt off, and I'm out here.
[02:16:07.618 --> 02:16:11.722]  I'm just out here with my shirt off, just hanging out, trying to reconnect and get myself back in shape.
[02:16:11.802 --> 02:16:12.943]  Lay in the grass, man.
[02:16:13.444 --> 02:16:15.005]  Connect your body barefoot to the earth.
[02:16:15.326 --> 02:16:16.747]  God made us, God made the earth.
[02:16:17.147 --> 02:16:22.973]  We don't worship the creation, but God made the creation, and by interfacing with it, we electrically connect more to God.
[02:16:23.293 --> 02:16:28.478]  So the earth's not God, but the reason the ancients worshipped it was because they could connect to God through it.
[02:16:28.838 --> 02:16:29.999]  It's a giant transmitter.
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:38.304]  So we can literally have to connect to it, and we need to be out in green pastures on a blanket with our girlfriend naked.
[02:16:38.744 --> 02:16:41.805]  You need to be in the sun, you need to be fishing, you need to be working outside.
[02:16:42.105 --> 02:16:47.768]  I mean, when I used to have time to go garden or work on a ranch or whatever, I'd be drooling by lunchtime.
[02:16:48.228 --> 02:16:50.170]  Drooling doing farm work.
[02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:56.394]  Just, I mean, in total zen meditation without even trying to say, uh, absolutely connected to God.
[02:16:57.075 --> 02:17:01.358]  And, and then now I live in hell inside this computer box, but it's okay because we're going to get out of it.
[02:17:01.378 --> 02:17:03.140]  But yes, all of this is unnatural.
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:04.220]  It totally sucks.
[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:04.861]  It's not who we are.
[02:17:05.161 --> 02:17:05.642]  God bless you.
[02:17:05.662 --> 02:17:06.182]  I appreciate you.
[02:17:07.403 --> 02:17:08.103]  Absolutely, man.
[02:17:08.144 --> 02:17:08.784]  You need to reconnect.
[02:17:08.804 --> 02:17:11.526]  You need to get naked on the grass, naked in the water.
[02:17:11.946 --> 02:17:14.528]  You need to go get in the ocean at night, swim in the black water.
[02:17:15.209 --> 02:17:15.789]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:15.809 --> 02:17:16.190]  Stay with us.
[02:17:17.964 --> 02:17:25.148]  Live, uncensored, raw, teleprompter free, coming to you from the barely red state of Texas.
[02:17:32.011 --> 02:17:35.533]  Dr. Nick Baggage is taking over next segment, then the War Room, Owen Schroeder, then...
[02:17:37.515 --> 02:17:39.336]  Seven to nine, election countdown.
[02:17:40.717 --> 02:17:42.759]  59 days out, Harrison Smith hosting tonight.
[02:17:43.419 --> 02:17:45.460]  Again, I love you, I appreciate you.
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:54.747]  Just remember how powerful you are when you share that live link to the show tonight on your email, your text message, your word of mouth, and via Facebook, Twitter, whatever, from 2020ElectionsCenter.com.
[02:17:55.167 --> 02:17:56.508]  That link's not being censored yet.
[02:17:57.288 --> 02:17:58.249]  2020ElectionsCenter.com.
[02:17:58.929 --> 02:18:00.290]  That's how we get all the new people.
[02:18:00.330 --> 02:18:03.673]  You say, hey, big forbidden information breaking right now here.
[02:18:04.173 --> 02:18:05.574]  Spread the word and it'll happen.
[02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:14.353]  All right, the caller I was about to go to just hung up, so we're going to next to Patrick in masks, says his wife was fired for not wearing a mask at work.
[02:18:14.794 --> 02:18:15.794]  Tell us about this, sir.
[02:18:16.834 --> 02:18:18.455]  Well, here's a quick story, Alex.
[02:18:18.495 --> 02:18:19.516]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:18:20.076 --> 02:18:24.978]  My fiancee has been working through this entire pandemic at Pride Gas Station, Springfield, Massachusetts.
[02:18:25.779 --> 02:18:28.620]  In Massachusetts, we have a mandatory mask mandate.
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:31.901]  My fiancee was asked to wear a mask while at work.
[02:18:32.061 --> 02:18:35.263]  She was told she could take her mask down when no customers are in the store.
[02:18:35.902 --> 02:18:40.084]  She was also told that customers didn't want to wear a mask, just take care of them quick and get them out.
[02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:49.609]  Well, last month, she was terminated for not demanding that others wear a mask and was accused for not wearing her mask for her entire eight-hour shift.
[02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:52.711]  Now, she disagrees with the mask, but she did with her job.
[02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:53.572]  She did her job.
[02:18:53.992 --> 02:18:54.812]  You know, she needs money.
[02:18:55.052 --> 02:18:59.715]  And actually, we bought a couple InfoWars masks because, you know, we might as well spread the word if we have to wear one.
[02:18:59.735 --> 02:19:00.075]  Yes, sir.
[02:19:00.595 --> 02:19:05.338]  And it was around the time that she started wearing that mask that her job became threatened.
[02:19:06.050 --> 02:19:10.915]  So much so that, you know, it was every single day and ultimately they terminated her.
[02:19:11.856 --> 02:19:12.616]  So that was it.
[02:19:12.696 --> 02:19:14.218]  It was the political message.
[02:19:14.278 --> 02:19:15.619]  It wasn't that she wasn't wearing a mask.
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:17.040]  Right.
[02:19:17.081 --> 02:19:21.284]  And I think this is something that, you know, maybe the president needs to look at a little bit.
[02:19:21.325 --> 02:19:22.706]  We're concerned about job numbers.
[02:19:22.806 --> 02:19:26.149]  I can't imagine that she's the only one experiencing this.
[02:19:27.050 --> 02:19:30.253]  There's got to be a lot of Americans out there that disagree with these mandates.
[02:19:31.141 --> 02:19:33.103]  And they're being terminated for wrongful reasons.
[02:19:33.163 --> 02:19:34.864]  I mean, this isn't a health issue anymore.
[02:19:35.124 --> 02:19:36.425]  It's become a political issue.
[02:19:36.705 --> 02:19:39.888]  Oh, it's 100% Democrats wear the mask and they bully us to wear them.
[02:19:40.188 --> 02:19:45.112]  It's like a petty way to control us ahead of the contact tracing and the tracking apps, which now the universities have.
[02:19:45.332 --> 02:19:46.353]  So they are rolling it out.
[02:19:46.413 --> 02:19:46.913]  It's official.
[02:19:47.554 --> 02:19:48.374]  Very, very dangerous.
[02:19:50.182 --> 02:19:55.543]  I'm going to do a two-hour show tomorrow on civil disobedience and the fact that it's time.
[02:19:56.344 --> 02:20:03.305]  And it's time to create the stencils so that people can spray paint things, because that's a nonviolent thing.
[02:20:03.345 --> 02:20:03.966]  We're in a war.
[02:20:04.026 --> 02:20:04.726]  We're the resistance.
[02:20:05.546 --> 02:20:12.568]  And it's time to explain to people how to buy a bucket of glue and how to print stuff off and to glue stuff up on government buildings and other facilities.
[02:20:13.608 --> 02:20:15.249]  And it's now time to do the info war.
[02:20:15.309 --> 02:20:17.671]  And I always do what I tell the listeners I think they should do.
[02:20:18.091 --> 02:20:22.274]  I'm going to climb up on some billboards in the near future and I'm going to take them over.
[02:20:22.294 --> 02:20:24.596]  I'm going to pick their propaganda billboards to do it to.
[02:20:25.236 --> 02:20:25.877]  I'll do it myself.
[02:20:25.897 --> 02:20:26.577]  I've done it before.
[02:20:27.198 --> 02:20:29.679]  And I'm going to spray paint walls and I'm going to stick stickers up.
[02:20:30.780 --> 02:20:37.485]  I personally, you know, in one night, you know, put up 500 stickers, billboards, you name it.
[02:20:38.225 --> 02:20:39.666]  And it's the funnest thing you'll ever do.
[02:20:39.806 --> 02:20:41.608]  Now, I'm not going to tell you to do it.
[02:20:42.523 --> 02:20:49.905]  And I'm not going to say you have to do it, but we should have a whole discussion, because we can't jump live on TV and take their shows over like we did four years ago.
[02:20:50.225 --> 02:20:54.406]  But we're going to have a big war game for two hours commercial free tomorrow, two to four.
[02:20:54.686 --> 02:20:56.847]  Everybody call in with what you think we should do.
[02:20:56.867 --> 02:20:57.667]  What do you think we should do?
[02:20:58.887 --> 02:21:00.168]  No mask Monday.
[02:21:00.428 --> 02:21:02.308]  We all remember Blackout Tuesday.
[02:21:02.488 --> 02:21:03.608]  No mask Monday.
[02:21:03.668 --> 02:21:07.129]  Let's give patriots at least one day to live in the land of the free again.
[02:21:07.569 --> 02:21:08.770]  No mask Monday.
[02:21:08.930 --> 02:21:09.590]  Pick one day.
[02:21:10.211 --> 02:21:16.317]  Go out there on your Monday, do your normal business, and if people are asking why you're not wearing your mask today, educate them.
[02:21:16.837 --> 02:21:17.338]  Absolutely.
[02:21:17.358 --> 02:21:19.820]  And you know, the type of things I target are state-funded things.
[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:20.901]  It's my taxpayer money.
[02:21:21.482 --> 02:21:26.727]  And if I see some state of Texas thanks you for wearing your mask, heroes, it's getting sprayed.
[02:21:27.742 --> 02:21:29.943]  And I don't do it to tag stuff.
[02:21:29.983 --> 02:21:31.603]  I didn't tag stuff when I was a teenager.
[02:21:32.043 --> 02:21:32.884]  I'm not a gang member.
[02:21:32.924 --> 02:21:33.604]  I'm an American.
[02:21:33.904 --> 02:21:36.004]  And the revolutionaries, they tag stuff.
[02:21:36.024 --> 02:21:37.025]  They handed out flyers.
[02:21:37.345 --> 02:21:38.385]  They painted on the walls.
[02:21:38.445 --> 02:21:41.026]  It's what you gotta do in a war when you're being suppressed.
[02:21:41.386 --> 02:21:42.326]  We're being suppressed.
[02:21:42.706 --> 02:21:43.687]  Hit the third dimension.
[02:21:43.967 --> 02:21:44.667]  God bless you, brother.
[02:21:49.428 --> 02:21:50.529]  I'm gonna pull some big stuff.
[02:21:51.369 --> 02:21:55.010]  We're gonna get out too with a drone and fly over crowds with a speaker on it and tell them it's all a fraud.
[02:21:56.434 --> 02:21:58.296]  And just whatever you can do, folks, just do it.
[02:21:59.616 --> 02:22:04.200]  And I said we'll do a protest in the name of this lady that got arrested, and we haven't set it up for tomorrow, so I'm not doing that.
[02:22:04.220 --> 02:22:05.241]  There's just not enough crew.
[02:22:05.281 --> 02:22:08.963]  But next week, we need to pick a day.
[02:22:08.983 --> 02:22:11.325]  I'll figure it out tonight.
[02:22:12.306 --> 02:22:13.807]  And we need to get out on the streets.
[02:22:14.968 --> 02:22:17.590]  And we need to have a demonstration at the governor's mansion because, I mean,
[02:22:20.575 --> 02:22:22.076]  By the way, I'm not playing around about the governor.
[02:22:22.096 --> 02:22:23.817]  I have to get all the names and stuff again.
[02:22:24.377 --> 02:22:25.598]  I'll just release it, whatever.
[02:22:26.259 --> 02:22:27.519]  I can't take it anymore, man.
[02:22:27.539 --> 02:22:29.661]  If people want war, they're going to get it.
[02:22:29.681 --> 02:22:32.663]  I mean, the gloves are off.
[02:22:32.683 --> 02:22:37.146]  I just can't live on my knees like this, this crap.
[02:22:38.646 --> 02:22:39.567]  I just can't do it anymore.
[02:22:41.688 --> 02:22:46.772]  So, we don't want to shoot in war, but the left
[02:22:47.881 --> 02:22:54.468]  Wants to bully us to keep our mouths shut and we're supposed to stay indoors, not supposed to have our church, and not supposed to go out because they're made up COVID crap.
[02:22:54.729 --> 02:22:58.092]  But then they're running around trying to kill the cops and shooting people in the head and burning everything down.
[02:22:58.373 --> 02:22:58.933]  Screw you!
[02:22:59.474 --> 02:23:01.296]  And screw any Republicans that go along with it.
[02:23:02.057 --> 02:23:02.918]  I'm serious, man.
[02:23:04.399 --> 02:23:06.582]  So we'll war game this for two hours tomorrow on air.
[02:23:06.602 --> 02:23:08.184]  We'll get the flyers, we'll get a page.
[02:23:10.563 --> 02:23:12.204]  A fact sheet to hand out when you're in stores.
[02:23:12.624 --> 02:23:15.246]  And just print off 20 things when you go to Walmart or Target.
[02:23:15.706 --> 02:23:17.187]  Or you gotta go to one of these places or anything.
[02:23:17.227 --> 02:23:19.088]  Just stick them in the gas pump.
[02:23:19.588 --> 02:23:20.189]  Hand them out.
[02:23:22.610 --> 02:23:24.111]  And all of that changes the world.
[02:23:24.131 --> 02:23:24.932]  People will resist.
[02:23:24.992 --> 02:23:25.672]  Don't go along with it.
[02:23:25.712 --> 02:23:26.012]  Say no.
[02:23:26.032 --> 02:23:26.713]  That's your right.
[02:23:27.053 --> 02:23:28.834]  But Big Tech says, oh, if you do that, we'll ban you.
[02:23:29.014 --> 02:23:32.176]  Well, we'll see what happens when we strewn these all over hell and back.
[02:23:32.876 --> 02:23:33.797]  We'll see how you like that.
[02:23:35.218 --> 02:23:37.279]  And this will get you used to getting out in the field, folks.
[02:23:39.206 --> 02:23:40.847]  But I got some places I know what I'm going to do.
[02:23:41.167 --> 02:23:42.588]  And I got a sneaking suspicion too.
[02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:49.412]  I'll even let the police department know what nights I'm going to be out.
[02:23:51.313 --> 02:23:57.076]  So they'll just drive right by when I'm up there on an overpass spraying the big giant arrest Bill Gates thing on the side of the deal.
[02:23:57.476 --> 02:24:03.980]  A lot of folks been spraying Pizza Gate is real on the highways and stuff like that.
[02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:05.041]  So we'll see what happens.
[02:24:06.715 --> 02:24:09.517]  I believe he has a big effect when you do that, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:10.738 --> 02:24:14.380]  I'm not going to sit here and take this crap anymore, and now is the time to hit the streets.
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:18.463]  All right, Michael in Ohio, last caller before Dr. Nick Baggage takes over.
[02:24:18.683 --> 02:24:19.603]  Amazing individual.
[02:24:20.344 --> 02:24:20.764]  We love him.
[02:24:20.924 --> 02:24:21.965]  Michael, go ahead, last caller.
[02:24:23.046 --> 02:24:29.990]  I just wanted to say how I've been spreading the word on a manufacturer I work at here in Ohio.
[02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:32.592]  It started out, I was just reading articles.
[02:24:33.291 --> 02:24:52.164]  When you guys broke the article about why the WHO faked a pandemic and how a quick test led to an epidemic that wasn't, I was telling people dates are important and I was just reading these articles to people and asking them, actually having them pull out their phone and do it themselves because that's more effective.
[02:24:52.264 --> 02:24:53.084]  Oh yeah, I forgot!
[02:24:53.104 --> 02:24:58.568]  They've got like New York Times and Forbes articles how the UN and the NIH have faked pandemics before.
[02:25:00.342 --> 02:25:03.165]  You know, pull out their phone themselves and have them look it up.
[02:25:03.605 --> 02:25:05.647]  I'm like, it sounds like it was from this year, right?
[02:25:05.667 --> 02:25:07.148]  Most of them are like, well, yeah.
[02:25:07.749 --> 02:25:09.670]  I'm like, click on it and look at the date it was written.
[02:25:09.690 --> 02:25:10.931]  I'm like, you see?
[02:25:11.492 --> 02:25:14.755]  Like, you see guys, what I'm telling you is not crazy, right?
[02:25:15.475 --> 02:25:17.457]  And they see it and they believe it.
[02:25:17.477 --> 02:25:21.120]  And I'm like, okay, now look up event 201.
[02:25:21.260 --> 02:25:25.444]  And they're like, well, you know, that was like the COVID thing.
[02:25:25.484 --> 02:25:27.365]  And I'm like, but look at when it happened.
[02:25:27.706 --> 02:25:27.926]  It was,
[02:25:28.610 --> 02:25:32.193]  A month before the first outbreak of COVID was reported in Wuhan.
[02:25:32.513 --> 02:25:34.075]  Well, you know why they did that?
[02:25:34.515 --> 02:25:35.296]  You know why they did that?
[02:25:35.676 --> 02:25:38.738]  Because if they had real meanings about running the operation, they'd get arrested for conspiracy.
[02:25:38.978 --> 02:25:42.681]  They cover and bootleg the real launch as if it's a drill.
[02:25:42.702 --> 02:25:43.522]  You understand how that works?
[02:25:44.683 --> 02:25:47.585]  And once they see that, you can see the lights go off.
[02:25:48.226 --> 02:25:49.767]  And they're like, how do you find this stuff?
[02:25:50.148 --> 02:25:53.470]  And I'm like, okay, when you guys go to this site, you're going to think it's crazy.
[02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:55.972]  But obviously what I just showed you is not crazy, right?
[02:25:56.252 --> 02:25:57.894]  And you don't understand now what's going on.
[02:25:58.482 --> 02:25:59.482]  They're starting to get that idea.
[02:25:59.502 --> 02:26:01.503]  Hand them an InfoWars sticker.
[02:26:01.643 --> 02:26:02.444]  I'm out of stickers.
[02:26:03.024 --> 02:26:06.105]  There are so many InfoWars stickers at my plant right now.
[02:26:06.185 --> 02:26:14.589]  Everyone's got them at their locker because I've told, you know, four other people that are dedicated listeners like me, and that's how we spread the word.
[02:26:14.749 --> 02:26:15.749]  Well, let me say this, Michael.
[02:26:15.789 --> 02:26:17.070]  This isn't me kissing your ass.
[02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.830]  Let me explain something.
[02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:18.751]  You are victory.
[02:26:19.311 --> 02:26:20.791]  You're just as important as I am.
[02:26:21.212 --> 02:26:23.573]  What you've done, if everybody, we have millions of listeners.
[02:26:23.653 --> 02:26:26.334]  If everybody does that, look at Dr. Nick Begich is wearing an Alex Jones mask.
[02:26:27.174 --> 02:26:28.275]  Punch him up, guys.
[02:26:28.575 --> 02:26:32.459]  If everybody simply does stuff like that, we're going to change the world.
[02:26:32.579 --> 02:26:34.421]  And we've not radicalized people.
[02:26:34.461 --> 02:26:39.445]  We've gotten people to look from a different perspective, from the globalist perspective, but from our perspective through them.
[02:26:39.886 --> 02:26:45.030]  And once people look through the enemy eyes and get why they're doing it, then they'll go, oh my God, now it all makes sense.
[02:26:45.350 --> 02:26:47.332]  A normal person's like, why would they do horrible things?
[02:26:47.532 --> 02:26:48.994]  Because they're not you, they're evil.
[02:26:49.734 --> 02:26:50.535]  Great job, Michael.
[02:26:50.555 --> 02:26:50.975]  We love you.
[02:26:51.857 --> 02:26:57.401]  Yeah, I need to do another bumper sticker bomb where we give out free bumper stickers.
[02:26:57.481 --> 02:26:58.782]  Every order gets some bumper stickers.
[02:26:59.563 --> 02:27:01.604]  We really appreciate everybody's support and their prayers.
[02:27:01.984 --> 02:27:05.267]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 2-4 with a live commercial-free show.
[02:27:05.527 --> 02:27:06.247]  Then the Sunday show.
[02:27:06.267 --> 02:27:09.330]  Then Owen does a new show, 6-8 as well.
[02:27:09.370 --> 02:27:09.950]  And Owen's coming up at 3.
[02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:11.691]  Dr. Nick Begich, straight ahead.
[02:27:13.072 --> 02:27:13.793]  Welcome back.
[02:27:16.198 --> 02:27:16.938]  And welcome back.
[02:27:17.018 --> 02:27:17.959]  It's good to be here.
[02:27:18.419 --> 02:27:30.866]  You know, just before the break, I was just joking around, you know, as I'm listening to the segments coming into this segment and I'm watching the video feed that a lot of you aren't seeing right now.
[02:27:30.926 --> 02:27:34.608]  And it's and they had the guy with the mask going through the store.
[02:27:34.648 --> 02:27:35.789]  And I thought, you know, that's it.
[02:27:35.849 --> 02:27:36.069]  Right.
[02:27:36.209 --> 02:27:39.911]  It's like, hey, it's about multiplying effect.
[02:27:40.071 --> 02:27:40.511]  OK.
[02:27:40.771 --> 02:27:44.433]  And so I picked up one of these when I was in Austin a few trips ago.
[02:27:46.609 --> 02:27:53.260]  Here's the thing, and what Alex was talking about in that last segment that I think is important, is it's about taking
[02:27:54.406 --> 02:28:04.970]  Unappropriate action that makes a difference in your community and sometimes a funny action is actually the one everyone remembers, you know, and it ignites a different kind of conversation.
[02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:15.654]  So here's what it took me to as I went and I reached this before the show began on my shelf behind me and I pulled off a book that I wrote.
[02:28:15.734 --> 02:28:18.735]  Now this is like, these were the Earth Pulse Flashpoints.
[02:28:18.835 --> 02:28:21.856]  I was publishing them back in the 90s and this one was from 1996.
[02:28:21.896 --> 02:28:21.997]  Now
[02:28:23.872 --> 02:28:31.797]  The articles that are important on here are still available for free now on the website earthpulse.com, so check that out, earthpulse.com.
[02:28:32.278 --> 02:28:39.922]  But the article I went to, and you can search it on the website, just do a quick search, it's called Change, Agents, and Reality Creation.
[02:28:39.962 --> 02:28:47.027]  I wrote it 24 years ago in 1996, and it was about dealing with the time we're in right now.
[02:28:47.147 --> 02:28:48.488]  And I'm gonna grab a
[02:28:49.148 --> 02:28:57.875]  A little bit, because it's a free article, it's still useful, and it's about kind of things you can do as an individual, become a committee of one, 59 days till election day.
[02:28:57.895 --> 02:29:07.522]  Those are things that you can do, whether you're an introvert, you know, who doesn't really like to get out there in front of the world, or an extrovert, someone who doesn't have a problem doing it.
[02:29:08.002 --> 02:29:14.367]  So there's a list of things and methods in that article about how to engage the process so you can
[02:29:15.126 --> 02:29:19.969]  You know, be effective and do something and be powerful, not powerless.
[02:29:19.989 --> 02:29:24.332]  And that's what we're really talking about now is, you know, what does it take?
[02:29:24.372 --> 02:29:27.714]  Sometimes humor does the job, you know, and it triggers a conversation.
[02:29:27.754 --> 02:29:28.695]  It breaks the tension.
[02:29:29.215 --> 02:29:35.940]  Sometimes it's a more direct thing about informing or being the informant of information that changes the perception.
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:37.501]  Because it's not about
[02:29:38.189 --> 02:29:39.050]  Always reality.
[02:29:39.090 --> 02:29:40.211]  That's what the other team knows.
[02:29:40.271 --> 02:29:42.453]  It's about how people interpret the reality.
[02:29:42.813 --> 02:29:49.600]  So you've got to deal with that, you know, not what you might know to be the underlying facts and why that's just illusion.
[02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:58.248]  You've got to deal with the fact, the fact that some people run on an illusion, on a delusion, okay?
[02:29:58.308 --> 02:30:02.091]  So to pierce the veil, so to speak, is not an easy thing.
[02:30:02.552 --> 02:30:03.893]  But back then I wrote
[02:30:05.434 --> 02:30:09.295]  A section of Change Agents for Reality Creation is called Fear and Conspiracy, right?
[02:30:09.855 --> 02:30:11.396]  And here, I'll just read a couple lines.
[02:30:11.656 --> 02:30:18.217]  It is disturbing to see the increase in general paranoia because of government over control.
[02:30:19.378 --> 02:30:25.539]  A good deal has been asserted by many individuals about the political, social, economic, and banking conspiracies
[02:30:26.312 --> 02:30:32.815]  Many of these reports accurately reflect factual observations and should be considered a significant cause for concern.
[02:30:33.195 --> 02:30:53.964]  I wrote that 24 years ago, and Alex talks about this, you know, as a fact that we were kind of saying how they would do it, what they would do, and how they would use, you know, you, your perception, and manipulate it to get you to move like a herd being shoved through the pasture into the gate, you know, for the slaughter, right?
[02:30:54.565 --> 02:30:54.965]  And so
[02:30:56.545 --> 02:31:00.186]  The point I'm making is the tools are there, okay?
[02:31:00.406 --> 02:31:05.008]  And the tools are used by the other side, are easily used by you.
[02:31:05.648 --> 02:31:14.051]  And it's about creating a conversation that changes the perception, okay, back into something more reality.
[02:31:14.071 --> 02:31:17.292]  You know, even the thought of fake news, how do you connect those two words?
[02:31:17.312 --> 02:31:22.154]  Because if it's news and it's fake, then it's not news, it's something else.
[02:31:22.434 --> 02:31:25.415]  But we gave it a new pair of words, fake news.
[02:31:26.451 --> 02:31:31.113]  Well, now everyone who already did doesn't trust the news media, right?
[02:31:31.193 --> 02:31:32.713]  Because it's not accurate.
[02:31:32.973 --> 02:31:34.954]  It's inaccurate most of the time.
[02:31:35.314 --> 02:31:36.995]  It's editorial most of the time.
[02:31:37.035 --> 02:31:37.855]  It's not factual.
[02:31:37.935 --> 02:31:38.816]  It doesn't elevate.
[02:31:38.896 --> 02:31:39.916]  It doesn't form.
[02:31:40.456 --> 02:31:45.018]  I mean, it doesn't create an environment of debate that's rational.
[02:31:45.558 --> 02:31:48.899]  It creates the bonfires you're seeing on the clip.
[02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:53.581]  You know, it creates the anxiety and tension between people.
[02:31:53.641 --> 02:31:54.341]  It's divisive.
[02:31:56.149 --> 02:32:08.953]  You know, and it's okay to be divided on political views, but it is not okay to be disrespectful of a dissenting opinion, whether you agree or disagree.
[02:32:10.334 --> 02:32:14.955]  And this is what we're seeing played out on the left, actually, this time around.
[02:32:14.995 --> 02:32:23.258]  And sometimes it's played out on the far right, sometimes on the far left, but this time it's been played out on the left for over a hundred days.
[02:32:24.853 --> 02:32:26.254]  And it's out of control.
[02:32:26.954 --> 02:32:51.083]  And so the thing that's being stripped from us or being attempted to strip from us is our individual power as individuals, which then, when it forms into what becomes, you know, the thrust of society or the foundation of government, remember, of the people, by the people, for the people, those concepts which aren't even really taught.
[02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:52.541]  Or understood.
[02:32:52.581 --> 02:33:00.446]  If you say those words to an elementary student and say sixth grade, they very likely will not know where that came from or what that means.
[02:33:01.827 --> 02:33:06.611]  Think about this, ladies and gentlemen, and those that are grandparents out there.
[02:33:06.651 --> 02:33:09.693]  Start having a conversation with your grandchildren that's different.
[02:33:10.999 --> 02:33:13.800]  You know, because this is the thing you're competing with.
[02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:33.386]  You know, I had some of my family members over last night, we're all talking, you know, and I have the conservative branch of the family, and the super liberal branch of the family, and the moderate branch of the family, and the perception of everyone that drives all of this is really the underlying
[02:33:34.412 --> 02:33:36.113]  Um, creative piece.
[02:33:36.193 --> 02:33:36.453]  Okay.
[02:33:36.473 --> 02:33:56.802]  So the article I wrote years ago, uh, change agents and reality creation is how to take the narrative, which is now what we call it as narrative, a script and rewrite it based on a set of facts and information that return power to you individually, and then allow you to empower others one person at a time in over 59 days.
[02:33:58.363 --> 02:34:05.412]  All the people listening to this have an opportunity to make sure the outcomes on this election in your community matter.
[02:34:05.512 --> 02:34:11.340]  Now, what's happening here in my community, and I'll talk about it a little bit, because, you know, I mean, we're on the moon, right?
[02:34:11.420 --> 02:34:11.881]  I say that.
[02:34:11.901 --> 02:34:15.946]  You know, we're so far removed from the rest of the country that you might as well be on the moon.
[02:34:16.366 --> 02:34:17.327]  But we do things differently.
[02:34:17.347 --> 02:34:19.489]  We haven't had any riots or anybody burning anything here.
[02:34:19.529 --> 02:34:24.392]  And if they did, it would be shut down pretty rapidly because Alaskans wouldn't tolerate that nonsense.
[02:34:24.733 --> 02:34:28.276]  But we got a lefty mayor who's been trying to bring the national script here.
[02:34:28.676 --> 02:34:33.239]  And he made national news, you know, because of shutting down businesses.
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:36.182]  And another guy, one of the guys who has a restaurant here, Reiner's,
[02:34:36.702 --> 02:34:39.503]  He made national news because they shut his restaurant down.
[02:34:39.543 --> 02:34:57.967]  He opened anyway, you know, and then they fine him $15,000 a day and people came into the restaurant and helped him with the fine, but you know, he only goes so long in a small town like Anchorage, you know, and so they shut down this guy because he didn't have the ability to open a sidewalk cafe like the mayor did with his restaurants that he owns downtown.
[02:34:58.247 --> 02:35:04.308]  He even shut off a public street to make sure his restaurant had a place to put their operation.
[02:35:04.975 --> 02:35:10.398]  You know, so, you know, this kind of thing happens all over the country, even in a remote place like Alaska.
[02:35:10.898 --> 02:35:12.099]  But here's what happened here.
[02:35:12.339 --> 02:35:18.422]  You see, the community got involved in a bunch of issues dealing with law and order.
[02:35:19.323 --> 02:35:20.764]  There's something that the liberals missed.
[02:35:20.864 --> 02:35:28.107]  And as a result, they're on the run in Anchorage, Alaska, because they have bad policy.
[02:35:28.568 --> 02:35:32.770]  And it's bad policy that gets riots in the streets and all of our major cities in the north.
[02:35:33.416 --> 02:35:34.599]  And that's what needs to end.
[02:35:35.019 --> 02:35:37.945]  Good policy starts with government being returned to good people.
[02:35:37.986 --> 02:35:40.992]  You're the tip of the spear, and this is Dr. Nick Begich, and we'll be right back.
[02:35:43.423 --> 02:35:44.444]  And welcome back.
[02:35:44.544 --> 02:35:46.565]  And remember, the InfoWars store.
[02:35:46.985 --> 02:35:47.606]  Take a look there.
[02:35:47.646 --> 02:35:50.728]  That's how all of the work of the network is supported.
[02:35:51.228 --> 02:35:54.310]  All of my books and videos exclusively available there.
[02:35:54.430 --> 02:36:03.696]  You know, in fact, I I looked on Amazon and because they're not available to the mainstream anymore, one of my books are trying to get a thousand dollars for it.
[02:36:03.776 --> 02:36:03.976]  Right.
[02:36:04.236 --> 02:36:08.759]  And you still get it for 18 bucks at the InfoWars store.
[02:36:09.159 --> 02:36:12.982]  But they're still, they've been out for a long time, but they're still timely.
[02:36:13.022 --> 02:36:18.966]  A lot of things I wrote were sort of the background of what was coming and the factual background.
[02:36:19.206 --> 02:36:25.650]  So there's a lot of footnotes, a lot of detail, a lot of information that make at least an understanding of what's happened.
[02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:26.611]  And at the same time,
[02:36:27.171 --> 02:36:27.892]  We're good to go.
[02:36:42.008 --> 02:36:42.849]  We're good to go.
[02:36:58.147 --> 02:37:07.135]  The piece of it that the local community and the Democrats were missing is this whole issue of the criminality that goes along with so much of it.
[02:37:07.155 --> 02:37:21.669]  A lot of it's mental illness, drug addiction, alcoholism that drives most of it, or did until this latest round that's going to force the next level of homelessness, which are not this type of person, but someone quite different.
[02:37:22.189 --> 02:37:27.792]  So, you have a whole lot of things going on around the country in a conversation about crime.
[02:37:27.852 --> 02:37:40.479]  Now, in my state, it's still about the crime being generated by the explosion of homelessness in our communities as it relates to pre-COVID drama homelessness.
[02:37:41.119 --> 02:37:56.045]  And the post-COVID homelessness, it hasn't come yet because of this money pumped into the program right now to really just prop up a system that is falling apart around the country.
[02:37:56.545 --> 02:38:01.087]  And it's falling apart around the country in the left-leaning cities.
[02:38:01.387 --> 02:38:06.530]  And the lawlessness that we're seeing play out has been used for political purposes.
[02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:09.751]  And this is what I resent, is
[02:38:10.837 --> 02:38:19.603]  It's political protest and all of that is totally in order, you know, in my in my view, totally in order.
[02:38:20.063 --> 02:38:24.025]  What isn't in order is violence and destruction of property.
[02:38:24.546 --> 02:38:30.309]  And a lot of these businesses that have been destroyed, you know, these are small businesses.
[02:38:30.369 --> 02:38:33.772]  Seventy percent of the backbone of the United States are small businesses.
[02:38:34.852 --> 02:38:39.135]  And you don't want this brought to a community like yours or like mine.
[02:38:39.770 --> 02:38:43.412]  And so the cities this isn't happening in, there's probably good reasons for it.
[02:38:44.413 --> 02:39:00.782]  And the reasons probably have something to do with a combination of a community that recognizes who they are and what they are as a governing body, and a representative body, the middle managers, if you will, of democracies in a republic, understand who they're accountable to.
[02:39:00.822 --> 02:39:04.044]  Now, in my community, that kind of broke off with
[02:39:04.504 --> 02:39:11.231]  Nine of our assembly members listening to five days of public testimony on an issue and ignoring it completely.
[02:39:11.251 --> 02:39:12.833]  That's happening all over.
[02:39:13.334 --> 02:39:21.342]  What is also happening is you're being called out on it in a way where the public's going, wait a minute, who's allowing this?
[02:39:21.877 --> 02:39:23.018]  Who's encouraging this?
[02:39:23.478 --> 02:39:31.204]  Who's doing things that are creating what I would call lawlessness, political lawlessness.
[02:39:31.224 --> 02:39:32.485]  Let's call it what it is.
[02:39:32.945 --> 02:39:37.689]  It's politicians behaving badly and then creating an environment.
[02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:40.771]  And I say it comes from the left.
[02:39:41.532 --> 02:39:50.599]  And the Pelosi's of the world are invigorating the debate in a way that is destructive as hell.
[02:39:51.391 --> 02:39:55.093]  And then they're doing mandates for masks and then the video runs.
[02:39:55.133 --> 02:39:59.595]  She gets her beauty shop appointment while the rest of the people in San Francisco don't.
[02:40:00.336 --> 02:40:01.656]  And then she screams foul.
[02:40:01.776 --> 02:40:02.537]  Oh, you caught me.
[02:40:03.497 --> 02:40:04.057]  Come on now.
[02:40:04.097 --> 02:40:04.518]  Okay.
[02:40:05.658 --> 02:40:06.939]  You set me up, she says.
[02:40:07.559 --> 02:40:08.139]  Wait a minute.
[02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:15.863]  You know, the facts are, while the rest of San Francisco can't get their hair done, you can without a mask.
[02:40:16.684 --> 02:40:16.884]  So?
[02:40:17.668 --> 02:40:23.753]  You know, it's the hypocrisy that aggravates everybody, and we're being played by it.
[02:40:23.793 --> 02:40:25.875]  And that's what really angers us all.
[02:40:26.375 --> 02:40:27.276]  But here's the deal.
[02:40:27.716 --> 02:40:31.940]  Their policies suck, you know, in the vernacular.
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:33.481]  They're just bad.
[02:40:34.041 --> 02:40:38.705]  So make sure people know that these policies are what gives you lawlessness.
[02:40:39.146 --> 02:40:45.651]  A policy that says, hey, it's okay to loot and reappropriate someone else's hard work for yourself.
[02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:47.981]  This is the policy of the left.
[02:40:48.921 --> 02:40:53.623]  You know, I talked to my son this morning before the program, my eldest son dropped by.
[02:40:53.643 --> 02:40:55.984]  I'm talking about his grandfather.
[02:40:56.765 --> 02:40:59.506]  Could he even be a Democrat in today's world?
[02:40:59.666 --> 02:41:00.446]  I don't think so.
[02:41:00.787 --> 02:41:07.510]  I don't know what he would have done, you know, because in the days of my dad, it was such a different thing.
[02:41:07.530 --> 02:41:09.510]  You know, it was so easy to figure it out.
[02:41:09.611 --> 02:41:12.412]  You know, the Democrats were working people back then.
[02:41:13.679 --> 02:41:16.500]  The Republicans represented business people and bankers.
[02:41:16.921 --> 02:41:17.461]  It was easy.
[02:41:17.481 --> 02:41:21.383]  Now it's not because the roles have switched, you know, in some ways.
[02:41:21.943 --> 02:41:26.565]  But the left just sort of went off in what they call left field.
[02:41:28.646 --> 02:41:30.807]  I mean, there's a reason metaphors exist.
[02:41:30.887 --> 02:41:32.288]  You know, they're not just made up.
[02:41:32.348 --> 02:41:34.109]  There's some reality to them, you know.
[02:41:34.689 --> 02:41:36.190]  And think about this.
[02:41:37.311 --> 02:41:38.011]  Think about this.
[02:41:39.051 --> 02:41:40.652]  They ought to call him Hidin' Biden.
[02:41:41.093 --> 02:41:42.614]  You know, he's hiding in the basement.
[02:41:42.714 --> 02:41:45.697]  You know, not Sleepy Joe, Hidin' Biden.
[02:41:46.177 --> 02:41:48.779]  He doesn't want to face the public and have a conversation.
[02:41:48.839 --> 02:41:50.201]  Same thing happened here locally.
[02:41:50.621 --> 02:41:53.904]  The Assembly, our local Assembly, had all their meetings tele-meetings.
[02:41:54.444 --> 02:41:56.305]  No face-to-face with constituents.
[02:41:56.345 --> 02:41:58.725]  That's not democracy in action, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:59.086 --> 02:42:09.469]  Face-to-face, facing your elected leaders, not on a teleprompter, not while they're watching a movie on the other channel and have the mute button on while public testimony is going on, because that's what happens.
[02:42:10.769 --> 02:42:11.730]  That's the reality.
[02:42:11.770 --> 02:42:12.650]  You're ignored.
[02:42:13.715 --> 02:42:20.336]  In this climate of COVID, you're ignored because they have a system of ignore now, instead of paying attention.
[02:42:20.897 --> 02:42:33.119]  So in our community, because a group of people got together around an issue and self-motivated, self-organized, and got a plan organized and are executing it in Anchorage, people are going to go away.
[02:42:33.139 --> 02:42:36.100]  You know, they're going to recall those that aren't up for election.
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:36.880]  Hurrah.
[02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:38.440]  And I think they'll be successful.
[02:42:39.401 --> 02:42:41.421]  They're going to make sure the guy leading this city
[02:42:42.478 --> 02:42:58.457]  Is is branded for failure that he is as a leader, our mayor, you know, and so, you know, in the sense of what's happening is an opportunity for truth also, you know, and so that's truth one person at a time.
[02:42:58.497 --> 02:43:02.582]  That's where your power, our power as individuals comes in.
[02:43:03.459 --> 02:43:05.321]  And that comes from a conversation.
[02:43:05.601 --> 02:43:12.246]  Now, here's what also has happened from the left that makes this difficult, is they have created an environment of total intimidation.
[02:43:12.947 --> 02:43:20.893]  You know, you don't want to wear a Trump button if you're on the right in a lot of places because you're afraid because you know someone's going to punch you in the eye, you know?
[02:43:22.314 --> 02:43:26.037]  And this is what they've created, an environment like that in this country.
[02:43:27.378 --> 02:43:32.662]  Now, that, my friend, is fundamentally wrong on every level.
[02:43:33.385 --> 02:43:36.906]  This is not about democracy and a republic.
[02:43:37.426 --> 02:43:40.247]  This is not about free speech within a republic.
[02:43:40.727 --> 02:43:42.388]  This is about manipulation.
[02:43:42.468 --> 02:43:46.990]  This is about limiting the voices of public debate.
[02:43:47.490 --> 02:43:49.370]  And those are the voices that need to be elevated.
[02:43:49.390 --> 02:43:56.573]  And that's each of us individually in a conversation with those that we can influence, that we have an opportunity to influence with the facts.
[02:43:57.133 --> 02:43:59.974]  So do that one person at a time.
[02:44:00.976 --> 02:44:04.657]  Do that in all the ways that you can individually, and you'll make a difference.
[02:44:05.097 --> 02:44:06.798]  And do it on the issues you care about.
[02:44:07.458 --> 02:44:08.018]  And you know what?
[02:44:08.239 --> 02:44:13.040]  Your passion will come through, and they'll drive you into an opportunity to make change.
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:18.582]  And the article, Change Agents and Reality Creation, it's free at earthholst.com.
[02:44:18.722 --> 02:44:20.063]  Go there, do a search, go find it.
[02:44:20.083 --> 02:44:20.703]  It's free!
[02:44:21.503 --> 02:44:24.386]  Everything there is free, as far as information that's posted there.
[02:44:24.406 --> 02:44:24.866]  There's a lot.
[02:44:25.246 --> 02:44:36.035]  But that article is 24 years old, and there's still great nuggets of information there that will help you, as an individual committee of one, make a difference.
[02:44:36.516 --> 02:44:37.917]  Be a committee of one.
[02:44:39.118 --> 02:44:40.059]  And here's what happens.
[02:44:40.079 --> 02:44:44.422]  I heard this from an Assemblies of God minister one time, Greenaway, and he said,
[02:44:46.306 --> 02:44:48.227]  If you don't know who's in charge, take over.
[02:44:48.547 --> 02:44:52.408]  And if they throw you out of town, get in line and act like it's a parade.
[02:44:52.788 --> 02:44:54.608]  And that's what I'm saying to you individually.
[02:44:55.188 --> 02:45:01.250]  Find a way to take over that area of your life that you can make a difference in and do that.
[02:45:01.690 --> 02:45:04.170]  Do the things that matter in your life right now.
[02:45:04.631 --> 02:45:05.691]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:45:05.711 --> 02:45:07.751]  We'll be right back after these brief messages.
[02:45:08.672 --> 02:45:09.552]  And welcome back.
[02:45:09.652 --> 02:45:14.333]  You know, it's Friday just before noon here in Anchorage, Alaska.
[02:45:15.214 --> 02:45:25.703]  Just thinking about all the work of the team there, again, in Austin and, you know, and really around the world, you know, everyone listening today, part of that team.
[02:45:26.524 --> 02:45:29.686]  And what a difference we can make.
[02:45:30.087 --> 02:45:39.114]  And this is the thing that we got to remember, you know, as as the new world order and global governments would like to strip us of the power that we each individually have.
[02:45:40.095 --> 02:45:42.257]  InfoWars has always about been
[02:45:42.917 --> 02:45:48.681]  Returning your power to you, you know, so you can do something different.
[02:45:49.121 --> 02:45:50.602]  And we have been.
[02:45:50.762 --> 02:45:55.526]  And I would say this about the team is what people don't see is what's behind it all.
[02:45:55.546 --> 02:46:01.229]  You know, it's a big machine to keep the information flowing, being collected.
[02:46:01.570 --> 02:46:10.296]  You know, when we come on the air, the subs and Alex, no one really has any idea what we're going to say until we start talking, you know.
[02:46:10.376 --> 02:46:12.297]  So the team has to put it all together.
[02:46:12.637 --> 02:46:13.397]  You know, and they do.
[02:46:13.797 --> 02:46:16.118]  And what a great network.
[02:46:16.859 --> 02:46:21.880]  And you're part of that network, which is why it's so important to stay in it to win it.
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:28.743]  And this is going to be probably, I believe, the most critical election that we've ever faced, at least in my lifetime.
[02:46:29.523 --> 02:46:37.866]  When I think about the disturbance in the force, you know, what's going on, is the fact that
[02:46:38.757 --> 02:46:41.079]  People are not all buying in.
[02:46:41.179 --> 02:46:49.625]  And the longer this thing stretches, the quicker the reality, because the real reality, the one that exists, not the disconnected one.
[02:46:50.145 --> 02:46:53.628]  And I want to talk a little bit about that, just in this context.
[02:46:54.364 --> 02:46:57.666]  Because there's a real stark image of it playing out.
[02:46:57.766 --> 02:47:05.290]  There's the real economy that people are suffering in today, you know, whether you're a small business owner or an unemployed person.
[02:47:05.891 --> 02:47:12.495]  And then there's the financial economy, which is, if you're in that one, you're excelling, right?
[02:47:12.535 --> 02:47:18.378]  Except the last couple days, lately, and you've made a lot of money, and you've stripped out a lot of wealth again.
[02:47:18.658 --> 02:47:21.840]  And now before it crashes again, you got your money out of the table.
[02:47:22.859 --> 02:47:39.937]  But the thing that's happening in all of this is a big shift in wealth on steroids headed a different direction, you know, headed out of town, so to speak, and a few crumbs being kicked off the table to keep the average citizen subdued a bit.
[02:47:41.460 --> 02:47:46.763]  You see, because it's like it got played out here in Alaska does every election season.
[02:47:46.783 --> 02:47:54.788]  It gets played out here because we have a thing called the permanent fund dividend, which is a check the government gives us, you know, out of our oil well.
[02:47:55.388 --> 02:47:57.009]  So it's a redistribution of our
[02:47:57.489 --> 02:47:58.089]  We're good to go.
[02:48:18.599 --> 02:48:19.720]  We're good to go.
[02:48:39.122 --> 02:48:43.204]  And it came early because of the COVID disaster and people needed money earlier.
[02:48:43.684 --> 02:48:55.889]  But the whole point is, is the way it was envisioned here was, hey, get the balance sheet working for the state and the underlying assets so that it pays for the operation of government.
[02:48:56.329 --> 02:48:59.671]  And then you don't have to tax people if our assets are making us money.
[02:49:00.852 --> 02:49:09.100]  And then when you are taxing the people for the things that make sense and you know, but here's the thing that nobody ever talks about is the assets you see another national level.
[02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:17.089]  We forget this because we're 18% just about 20% of consider the 200 mile limit as part of that equation for Alaska.
[02:49:17.745 --> 02:49:25.549]  We're like this giant treasury up here, like this huge safety deposit box that the globalists have got.
[02:49:26.189 --> 02:49:29.471]  Well, we screw the rest of the world out of their resources.
[02:49:29.531 --> 02:49:32.192]  We have this treasury in Alaska sitting there.
[02:49:32.412 --> 02:49:37.235]  And when all the rest of the places have thrown us out, you've got to think about this.
[02:49:37.835 --> 02:49:46.239]  And we've exploited all their resources for a few cents on the dollar and bribed their politicians overtly with bags of money the way it's done, you see.
[02:49:47.555 --> 02:49:55.964]  Then we're going to come to Alaska and we're going to crack open all these National Parks and Preserves that were put in place as National Parks and Preserves.
[02:49:56.345 --> 02:50:01.130]  But the environmental community thought they were preserving National Parks and Preserves.
[02:50:01.150 --> 02:50:08.017]  What they were preserving was taking out of the public domain resources, tremendous resources,
[02:50:09.042 --> 02:50:31.828]  And put them in a way where you and I can go out and claim those resources, put them into production, make them work the way it was intended in the country, into a way that they could be locked up so that when the national emergencies began, they would invite the globalists in, who were the only ones big enough to do the job and rescue America, and they would be invited in to exploit these resources and develop them.
[02:50:33.015 --> 02:50:36.838]  You see, and they would make the money and not you and me, the way it was intended.
[02:50:37.238 --> 02:50:44.963]  So this is always what the early left, the left of the 60s and the 50s here in Alaska was guarding.
[02:50:44.983 --> 02:50:50.286]  That's what Eisenhower was talking about, you know, worrying about the military-industrial complex.
[02:50:50.326 --> 02:50:54.289]  What he didn't add in is the academic and science complex and a few other things.
[02:50:55.009 --> 02:50:59.812]  And the real deal is, it's a fight over the wealth of the nation.
[02:51:00.833 --> 02:51:02.454]  This is what it is about.
[02:51:03.214 --> 02:51:06.415]  The wealth of the nation, ladies and gentlemen, balance sheet.
[02:51:07.175 --> 02:51:15.378]  And the propaganda, yogananda, garbage, BS that they want to tell you is fertilizer for the mind and soul is not.
[02:51:15.859 --> 02:51:16.959]  And here's the disconnect.
[02:51:17.619 --> 02:51:28.923]  This fictional, airy, fairy, financial economy that exists on air and often belief and faith.
[02:51:30.484 --> 02:51:30.904]  On what?
[02:51:34.375 --> 02:51:40.837]  At the end of the day, when the air is pulled out of that balloon and it goes flying across the room, you'll get the picture, right?
[02:51:40.937 --> 02:51:43.078]  Because it's puff, puff money.
[02:51:44.118 --> 02:51:57.222]  The real economy is the one that people are suffering in right now, where your physical flesh and soul is being beaten down by propaganda, Yogananda, the BS, okay?
[02:51:57.762 --> 02:51:58.923]  That's what it is.
[02:51:59.263 --> 02:51:59.743]  It's not
[02:52:00.518 --> 02:52:03.800]  Fake news, a new narrative, it's all BS, okay?
[02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:07.781]  You've got to carve your way through it and sort out the facts and information.
[02:52:08.322 --> 02:52:21.588]  Relight your internal fire and go do something that you can do and do it in the right way that recognizes dignity and honor in another created living soul, for goodness sakes.
[02:52:22.108 --> 02:52:24.749]  And then get in the game again.
[02:52:26.094 --> 02:52:33.599]  And if you're a little worried, or if you're a lot worried about being punched in the eye as you walk around town, do it in a way where you feel comfortable then.
[02:52:33.659 --> 02:52:35.140]  But do something.
[02:52:35.160 --> 02:52:35.400]  Okay?
[02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:40.323]  If you're the introvert that can't do it in an overt way, then do it in an introverted way.
[02:52:41.103 --> 02:52:42.704]  You know, do a simple thing.
[02:52:43.024 --> 02:52:44.285]  Write letters to the editor.
[02:52:44.325 --> 02:52:45.186]  Maybe they'll print them.
[02:52:45.566 --> 02:52:46.867]  Write them in a least-see alternative.
[02:52:46.927 --> 02:52:47.707]  Maybe they'll print them.
[02:52:47.747 --> 02:52:50.909]  Send some emails to your friends and give them some facts and information.
[02:52:51.530 --> 02:52:55.372]  You know, and don't do it in a confrontational way that gets into a fight.
[02:52:56.081 --> 02:52:58.222]  Because those are the ones you're not going to convince.
[02:52:58.822 --> 02:52:59.683]  You know?
[02:52:59.703 --> 02:52:59.963]  Okay?
[02:53:00.323 --> 02:53:01.224]  You're not going to convince them.
[02:53:01.644 --> 02:53:05.786]  Then provide them information about their candidate for why they might not want to vote for them.
[02:53:05.806 --> 02:53:08.387]  Because then maybe they won't go to the polls to vote for them at least.
[02:53:09.628 --> 02:53:14.670]  But give them the information that is useful to them to convince them to change their mind.
[02:53:15.351 --> 02:53:15.671]  Do that.
[02:53:16.211 --> 02:53:17.132]  One person at a time.
[02:53:17.672 --> 02:53:20.733]  That's how in 59 days the results will be in.
[02:53:21.093 --> 02:53:22.554]  That will change the world or not.
[02:53:22.574 --> 02:53:24.055]  Because here's what can happen.
[02:53:25.257 --> 02:53:36.904]  If you have a fully democratically controlled Senate, and a democratically controlled House, and a democratically controlled Executive, then you will have a disaster in the United States.
[02:53:37.685 --> 02:53:38.765]  A total disaster.
[02:53:39.726 --> 02:53:42.588]  And the only saving grace then might be the U.S.
[02:53:42.608 --> 02:53:43.268]  Supreme Court.
[02:53:43.728 --> 02:53:47.351]  But the time it takes to sort things out there is way too long.
[02:53:48.692 --> 02:53:50.012]  So we have to get involved.
[02:53:50.032 --> 02:53:50.753]  We have to vote.
[02:53:51.293 --> 02:53:52.614]  Don't let them take it away.
[02:53:52.714 --> 02:53:54.015]  Don't let them intimidate you.
[02:53:55.100 --> 02:53:58.881]  Get engaged, get in the game, do everything you can to make a difference.
[02:53:59.521 --> 02:54:01.541]  And that's what it's all about right now.
[02:54:01.861 --> 02:54:04.062]  It's an info war that we're in the middle of.
[02:54:04.522 --> 02:54:06.602]  If you're going to be the tip of the spear, then be that.
[02:54:07.262 --> 02:54:20.424]  But do it in a way that really changes the game and changes people's perception by pointing out facts and the information that supports your arguments because they carry the day.
[02:54:20.884 --> 02:54:23.625]  Because these policies are being played out in the streets.
[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:24.580]  Okay.
[02:54:39.156 --> 02:54:40.797]  We trust that layer.
[02:54:40.957 --> 02:54:52.823]  And there's too much power in the wrong people being driven by non-profits who have way too much power and don't contribute anything in terms of money to the taxes that decide what public policy is.
[02:54:53.263 --> 02:54:55.924]  They get to take the bandwidth away from us.
[02:54:56.405 --> 02:54:57.825]  Take the bandwidth back.
[02:54:58.446 --> 02:54:59.766]  Be part of the discussion.
[02:55:00.127 --> 02:55:01.427]  Be part of the dialogue.
[02:55:01.747 --> 02:55:03.028]  Support this network.
[02:55:03.088 --> 02:55:04.609]  Go to the Infowars store.
[02:55:05.319 --> 02:55:09.443]  Buy something that informs you so you can inform others.
[02:55:09.843 --> 02:55:11.784]  And you support this network.
[02:55:12.405 --> 02:55:15.167]  It's the 360Win that Alex talked about.
[02:55:15.207 --> 02:55:16.528]  Take advantage of it today.

[02:55:20.352 --> 02:55:21.793]  This has been Dr. Nick Begich.

[02:55:34.721 --> 02:55:35.922]  Monday Essential Special.

[02:56:13.622 --> 02:56:14.482]  Check it out for yourselves.
[02:56:14.542 --> 02:56:16.423]  And if you want to see InfoWars, a 360 win.
[02:56:16.443 --> 02:56:19.044]  The only way you lose is not by taking action.
[02:56:19.364 --> 02:56:20.784]  And I want to explain that again.
[02:56:21.084 --> 02:56:23.065]  Your support of InfoWars.
[02:56:23.425 --> 02:56:28.013]  ...has stood in defiance of George Soros, The Globalist, Hillary, and all these scumbags.
[02:56:28.313 --> 02:56:29.215]  So great job!
[02:56:29.495 --> 02:56:30.877]  You built what we've done!
[02:56:30.897 --> 02:56:31.939]  I salute you!
[02:56:35.290 --> 02:56:36.250]  Living Defense.
[02:56:36.510 --> 02:56:37.711]  This is beyond a probiotic.
[02:56:37.751 --> 02:56:43.933]  It's got all these things known to flush out the bad little visitors in the guts and really get your guts up to optimum condition.
[02:56:43.973 --> 02:56:46.073]  And have you ever thought probiotics were amazing, which they are?
[02:56:46.093 --> 02:56:48.574]  This is next level and does it a different way.
[02:56:48.794 --> 02:56:50.315]  It targets and gets rid of bad guys.
[02:56:50.395 --> 02:56:54.416]  It doesn't promote the good guys, because when you get rid of the bad guys, the good guys can operate.
[02:56:54.456 --> 02:56:55.676]  The new oil is targeting your gut.
[02:56:55.756 --> 02:56:58.917]  Living Defense is the best, most powerful formula, and it is a big bottle.
[02:56:59.078 --> 02:57:00.018]  Let me show TV viewers this.
[02:57:00.538 --> 02:57:01.239]  It's a brand new bottle.
[02:57:01.259 --> 02:57:02.760]  I was remembering, I haven't taken this in about six months.
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:03.801]  I take it about twice a year.
[02:57:04.081 --> 02:57:04.441]  Look at this.
[02:57:04.582 --> 02:57:05.142]  Look at that.
[02:57:05.202 --> 02:57:05.582]  Look at this.
[02:57:05.663 --> 02:57:06.964]  Damn, there's one on the floor everywhere.
[02:57:06.984 --> 02:57:07.724]  There's so many of them.
[02:57:07.885 --> 02:57:08.365]  Hold on.
[02:57:08.385 --> 02:57:08.825]  There you go.
[02:57:08.965 --> 02:57:09.966]  I mean, what's on the floor?
[02:57:10.066 --> 02:57:11.067]  These babies are amazing.
[02:57:11.087 --> 02:57:16.072]  You take a few of these a day for a month, you're going to have some results that are, let's just say, magnificent.
[02:57:16.272 --> 02:57:18.374]  And this is Mother Nature gave us.
[02:57:18.474 --> 02:57:19.475]  God gave us Mother Nature.
[02:57:19.615 --> 02:57:21.657]  It is livingdefenseinfowarstore.com.
[02:57:21.797 --> 02:57:22.858]  And you find the InfoWar.
[02:57:22.898 --> 02:57:24.940]  So it's a total win-win, win-win-win.
[02:57:25.140 --> 02:57:26.201]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:57:39.005 --> 02:57:41.227]  Please remember that it's down to the wire.
[02:57:42.549 --> 02:57:48.235]  When I say please tell people about Van.Video or NewsWorks.com or InfoWars.com, people are ready to hear the truth.
[02:57:48.655 --> 02:57:50.117]  Everything is basically censored now.
[02:57:51.328 --> 02:57:53.109]  We built our own system to be able to do this.
[02:57:53.169 --> 02:57:54.530]  We're on over 200 radio stations.
[02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:56.511]  We're on over 100 TV stations and cable stations.
[02:57:56.571 --> 02:57:57.892]  And we've got Bandot Video.
[02:57:57.952 --> 02:57:59.453]  Get the videos from Bandot Video.
[02:57:59.513 --> 02:58:00.174]  Get the articles.
[02:58:00.334 --> 02:58:04.397]  So many videos, so many films, so many reports can only be found at Bandot Video.
[02:58:04.557 --> 02:58:08.659]  All these top medical doctors can't even come out and say what happened with their patients or their band.
[02:58:08.740 --> 02:58:09.740]  And now they're getting in trouble.
[02:58:09.800 --> 02:58:11.081]  And now they're losing their licenses.
[02:58:11.181 --> 02:58:12.302]  I mean, this is terror!
[02:58:12.562 --> 02:58:16.825]  And we're under massive attack, massive infiltration, massive globalist operations.
[02:58:17.205 --> 02:58:20.327]  I can't even get to on air, but your prayers are keeping us in the fight.
[02:58:20.648 --> 02:58:21.528]  So just thank you so much.

[02:58:34.738 --> 02:58:38.981]  Take this lull where they've gotten caught up on food shipments to get your orders in before what's coming.
[02:58:39.001 --> 02:58:42.664]  Because even if Trump wins, even if we stabilize stuff, they're going to start a civil war after that.
[02:58:42.944 --> 02:58:46.446]  The Betsy Ross flag combined with the Don't Tread on Me Gadsden flag are two
[02:59:09.460 --> 02:59:16.403]  Founding images of our Republic are two iconic images that let us remember what makes our country so great.
[02:59:16.804 --> 02:59:22.526]  Rugged individualism, the revolutionary spirit to launch the greatest, freest nation in the world's history.
[02:59:23.227 --> 02:59:27.109]  An American system that threatens the global corporate anti-human system.
[02:59:27.669 --> 02:59:30.090]  A system they must discredit and destroy.
[02:59:30.512 --> 02:59:34.815]  If they believe they're going to extinguish the light of liberty in the hearts and minds of humans across this planet.

[03:00:04.326 --> 03:00:07.728]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[03:00:07.748 --> 03:00:08.909]  They're going to contest the election.
[03:00:08.929 --> 03:00:10.470]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[03:00:10.650 --> 03:00:12.051]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[03:00:12.131 --> 03:00:13.152]  I want them shut down.
[03:00:13.232 --> 03:00:14.132]  I want them silenced.
[03:00:14.192 --> 03:00:14.873]  I want them muted.
[03:00:14.893 --> 03:00:16.794]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:00:16.814 --> 03:00:17.775]  You kept us on air.
[03:00:17.895 --> 03:00:19.176]  We did the analysis first.
[03:00:19.456 --> 03:00:20.476]  It's now gone mainstream.
[03:00:20.516 --> 03:00:22.338]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[03:00:22.598 --> 03:00:28.542]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[03:00:28.722 --> 03:00:30.163]  And you need to stop right now.
[03:00:30.263 --> 03:00:31.323]  And they're very, very serious.
[03:00:31.483 --> 03:00:33.805]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil worshiping child molesters.
[03:00:34.005 --> 03:00:34.745]  This is not going to happen.
[03:00:34.786 --> 03:00:36.667]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[03:00:37.147 --> 03:00:38.248]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[03:00:38.708 --> 03:00:39.629]  Rescue InfoWars.
[03:00:39.689 --> 03:00:40.329]  Save yourself.
[03:00:40.689 --> 03:00:41.330]  Save the world.
[03:00:41.650 --> 03:00:42.490]  We're in this together.
[03:00:42.511 --> 03:00:44.252]  Because let me tell you something.
[03:00:44.272 --> 03:00:45.252]  Communism's up here.
[03:00:45.452 --> 03:00:48.394]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[03:00:48.795 --> 03:00:50.616]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[03:00:50.836 --> 03:00:52.357]  My children are right here!
[03:00:53.097 --> 03:00:54.878]  But I need money to fight a war!
[03:00:55.039 --> 03:00:56.099]  And I need word of mouth!
[03:00:56.319 --> 03:00:57.220]  And I need prayer!
[03:00:57.240 --> 03:00:58.321]  And I need action!
[03:00:58.701 --> 03:01:00.282]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[03:01:01.002 --> 03:01:02.944]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
