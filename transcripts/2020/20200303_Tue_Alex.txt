[00:00:16.437 --> 00:00:21.941]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:35.671]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:40.354]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is March 3rd on this Tuesday Global Transmission.
[00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.169]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.390]  We are 244, 244 out from a historic election.
[00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.712]  And today is Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday, like Joe Biden.
[00:00:54.712 --> 00:00:55.472]  I hate Joe Biden.
[00:00:55.472 --> 00:01:06.476]  He's a globalist and evil and obviously a pedophile pervert who can't help but try to stick his tongue down his own niece's throats and tell little seven-year-old girls they're hot and that he makes them horny.
[00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:08.377]  Those are quotes caught on hot mics.
[00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:18.199]  But man, just to watch the Democrats put him up there while he's degenerating, and sounds like he's got marbles in his mouth.
[00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:30.321]  At his current level of degeneration, I predict within six months, he is in complete dementia, trying to, again, engage in finger painting with his own feces.
[00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:33.622]  And I'm sorry to be gross about that, but that is the track he's on.
[00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:36.482]  I've been saying that, Tucker Carlson said it last Friday.
[00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:37.383]  This is amazing.
[00:01:37.383 --> 00:01:39.063]  He is totally emblematic.
[00:01:40.563 --> 00:01:47.692]  of the Democrats and how they pass power on like the Dark Crystal Skepsis or something, and how disconnected from reality.
[00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:55.642]  And there's an incredible video we're going to play next segment of him saying, Beto is my czar of gun confiscation.
[00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:02.522]  You, Lord Vader, go forth and destroy them.
[00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.043]  Destroy the guns.
[00:02:04.043 --> 00:02:05.583]  Take the firearms.
[00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:08.664]  Execute order number 66.
[00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:09.684]  It's incredible.
[00:02:09.684 --> 00:02:10.664]  That's coming up.
[00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.925]  We have a bunch of guests today.
[00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:20.807]  And, you know, I saw this headline this morning, and I just kicked myself.
[00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:24.248]  I mean, we reported this over four weeks ago.
[00:02:24.248 --> 00:02:24.708]  I did.
[00:02:24.708 --> 00:02:25.468]  Mike Adams did.
[00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:26.869]  I told you we have White House sources.
[00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.511]  We have sources in the military.
[00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:37.312]  And I announced then that a secret emergency had been declared, and mobilization, which is a national emergency.
[00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:39.993]  But it was only declared within certain areas of the government.
[00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.714]  That's a huge piece of news!
[00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:50.496]  But I never came on with dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun
[00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.997]  FEMA preparing for possible Coronavirus National Emergency Declaration NBC News today.
[00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:05.202]  So if you want next month's news today, InfoWars.com.
[00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:09.326]  We're on record laying that out a month ago, but why is that important?
[00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:15.212]  It's not, oh, we reported this first and they've secretly already set up this emergency.
[00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:16.474]  It's that there's a plan.
[00:03:18.755 --> 00:03:27.958]  And the government believes that the virus is extremely deadly, but Trump isn't playing along with the chi-coms of the total hysteria, and I get that, because that'll plunge the economy.
[00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.839]  So it's a balancing act, and I've got to say, I really commend the President.
[00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:35.400]  Also, the withdrawal out of Afghanistan after 19 years has begun.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.342]  They're pulling troops out fast, and the Taliban will just stop trying to kill U.S.
[00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:39.682]  soldiers.
[00:03:40.362 --> 00:03:42.844]  We'll let China try to run that country.
[00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:49.510]  We've put over a trillion dollars into that cesspit, that backwards, devil-worshipping, pedophile command base.
[00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.952]  I mean, that's the religion there is having sex with little boys.
[00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:52.893]  Literally.
[00:03:52.893 --> 00:03:53.553]  Talk to all the troops.
[00:03:53.553 --> 00:03:54.234]  It's on record.
[00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.595]  They're told to cover it up.
[00:03:55.595 --> 00:04:01.020]  Remember the troops that, like, arrested dudes screwing five-year-old boys and selling them as sex slaves?
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.681]  And the military gets reprimanded.
[00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:04.743]  They go, that's their culture to screw five-year-olds.
[00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:05.504]  Hollywood loves it.
[00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:10.930]  Well, I mean, it's not the Muslim culture in general, but over in Afghanistan it is, man.
[00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.372]  And that's on record.
[00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:18.059]  And the CHICOMs have gotten over half a trillion in rare earth minerals out of Afghanistan.
[00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:25.468]  There's gold in their hills of the rare earth minerals they need for Silicon Valley and for the CHICOM systems, for all the electronics.
[00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:32.125]  More lithium there than any other country per square mile, some experts believe.
[00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:35.127]  And we do all the security, they get the goodies.
[00:04:35.127 --> 00:04:36.288]  No China.
[00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:36.929]  The U.S.
[00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:41.832]  propping you up is over, over, over, over.
[00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:47.117]  You go in there with those knuckle-dragging cavemen, and you go get your lithium.
[00:04:47.117 --> 00:04:52.701]  Shove it up your dirty CHICOM arses.
[00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:53.922]  Stay with us.
[00:04:53.922 --> 00:04:56.204]  I'm energizing for the main attack.
[00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:04.133]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:06.854]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:08.574]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.235]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:11.195]  That was a crazy week.
[00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:22.859]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:24.180]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[00:05:25.663 --> 00:05:28.065]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[00:05:28.065 --> 00:05:29.446]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:33.709]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:35.930]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.431]  I don't think that happens very often.
[00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:38.252]  It's never happened to me.
[00:05:38.252 --> 00:05:41.154]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[00:05:41.154 --> 00:05:42.855]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:45.756]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:53.738]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your health right now, and support the resistance.
[00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:57.039]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.580]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.942]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:16.643]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.303]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:24.526]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.526 --> 00:06:31.849]  President Trump, about four and a half weeks ago, ordered the Pentagon and FEMA
[00:06:33.103 --> 00:06:41.609]  To prepare a national emergency, but he instituted the national emergency in response to coronavirus at that point.
[00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:47.473]  And the Democrats have taken the bait in saying that he did not have any response to it.
[00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:50.094]  I think he's had a very measured response.
[00:06:50.094 --> 00:06:52.296]  He's not said that the virus is a hoax.
[00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:55.078]  He said the hysteria by the chi comms and the media
[00:06:56.463 --> 00:06:56.903]  Is it a hoax?
[00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:22.602]  That said, though, the globalists are going to launch a lot of other operations.
[00:07:22.602 --> 00:07:27.044]  Turkey declared war on Europe, started flooding hundreds of thousands of people in.
[00:07:27.044 --> 00:07:30.585]  They said they've got three to five million ready to flood.
[00:07:30.585 --> 00:07:43.930]  They are literally just forcibly taking all the Muslim Arabs and Syrians, most of them came from outside Syria, that it invaded, and they're now forcing them
[00:07:45.546 --> 00:07:48.347]  To go into the Balkans.
[00:07:48.347 --> 00:07:49.688]  And Greece is the front line?
[00:07:49.688 --> 00:07:57.872]  In fact, Greece has been invaded and attacked by Muslims more than any other place on Earth.
[00:07:57.872 --> 00:08:00.774]  Serbia is number two, if you study history.
[00:08:00.774 --> 00:08:08.537]  We owe a debt to the Serbs and a debt to the entire Balkans that's held on, though half the Balkans is now run by the Muslims.
[00:08:08.537 --> 00:08:09.258]  And guess what?
[00:08:09.258 --> 00:08:13.400]  If you're a Christian, yo ass is raped, murdered, or you're running.
[00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:18.478]  Oh, but we've got to bow down to it.
[00:08:18.478 --> 00:08:22.400]  But don't you go kiss your boyfriend if you're a dude in Saudi Arabia.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.281]  They kill your ass.
[00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:25.941]  But see, they're good.
[00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:29.923]  It's America that's bad, right?
[00:08:29.923 --> 00:08:32.885]  So that's all coming up and so much more today.
[00:08:34.008 --> 00:08:40.092]  Well, FEMA preparing for possible coronavirus emergency declaration NBC News.
[00:08:40.092 --> 00:08:53.501]  We told you a month ago that there was a secret declaration of emergency and that Trump prepared the military bases and facilities that they believe that Washington State would be the epicenter of an ongoing national outbreak that was then taking place.
[00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:55.562]  Now I got that from a White House source.
[00:08:55.562 --> 00:08:57.003]  I got that from another source that was a big
[00:08:58.214 --> 00:09:00.554]  Alita's top Republican banquet Trump was at.
[00:09:00.554 --> 00:09:05.315]  They were openly talking about it in breakaway groups with the Pentagon folks that were there.
[00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:09.396]  And then I got it from Mike Adams's source in Seattle.
[00:09:09.396 --> 00:09:18.438]  He came on and confirmed that as well, that they've been told the emergency is already in place, but they didn't want to create a panic.
[00:09:18.438 --> 00:09:22.539]  And they believed then, as I told you four weeks ago, the Pentagon's really running it, not FEMA.
[00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:34.293]  That it broke containment months ago, and that it's really all over the United States, and that it's race-specific, man-made, and is going to kill a lot of Asian Americans.
[00:09:34.293 --> 00:09:39.595]  Yes, Asian Americans, particularly Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, whose genetics are very similar.
[00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:42.337]  It's a very close family genetic group.
[00:09:42.337 --> 00:09:45.758]  I wouldn't call it inbred, but it's just, you know, it's close to that.
[00:09:45.758 --> 00:09:49.960]  Just a fact, they are looking, they could have 2% death rates.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:10:02.889]  So the numbers that we see, we may put that graph up from yesterday, the Pentagon believes, now these numbers are public, but I've talked to several current and retired lieutenant colonels that have been in intelligence, that are in intelligence.
[00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:10.575]  They believe, FEMA believes, Homeland Security believes, CDC believes, that about half the public will get the virus, will be exposed to it, and that
[00:10:11.735 --> 00:10:14.057]  The death rate's at about one and a half to two percent.
[00:10:14.057 --> 00:10:15.958]  We're looking at three million or so dead.
[00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:22.904]  But see, when you add it to what's race-specific, well, what percentage of America is what you'd call Asian?
[00:10:22.904 --> 00:10:24.345]  And then what derivation of Asian?
[00:10:24.345 --> 00:10:28.188]  Because you've got a lot of Caucasian and Indians.
[00:10:28.188 --> 00:10:38.357]  A lot of Caucasians went into India over the last 5,000, 6,000 years, and so they're not as susceptible to it, though they are more than an Anglo or
[00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:52.835]  And Africans can get it as well, just not at the level of a Japanese person who has the smallest genetic family originally derived from China.
[00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:55.357]  So, that's what we're looking at.
[00:10:55.357 --> 00:10:57.139]  And they've been trying to suppress the real numbers.
[00:10:57.139 --> 00:11:03.544]  You know, months ago, before this even started, I said, I feel a disturbance in the force, a tremor, the last time I felt it.
[00:11:04.184 --> 00:11:05.566]  Was right before 9-11.
[00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:12.975]  And I had them put up that image of the astronaut standing in a national park, in a forest.
[00:11:12.975 --> 00:11:16.259]  Could be Colorado, could be Washington State, could be anywhere.
[00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:17.280]  And he's standing there.
[00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:23.446]  Because he's on planet Earth, but you see all these bubbles in the air, assembling microbes.
[00:11:23.446 --> 00:11:29.287]  And so, he can't survive outside of a spacesuit or outside of a containment facility.
[00:11:29.287 --> 00:11:31.308]  And so that's why we had that archetype.
[00:11:31.308 --> 00:11:34.189]  And I said, that's coming, that's what we're facing.
[00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:38.650]  I just, you can see it in the programming, you can see it in the preparation.
[00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.732]  They are making a world that humans can't live on unless we change ourselves into the system.
[00:11:44.588 --> 00:11:45.969]  That they want.
[00:11:45.969 --> 00:11:50.411]  Now, Mike Adams has got huge updates for us, and he'll be joining us.
[00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:52.712]  The HealthRangerNaturalNews.com.
[00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:59.194]  Just ultra massive information coming up on the other side of this break.
[00:11:59.194 --> 00:12:05.017]  But let me shift gears for a moment here and get to this.
[00:12:05.017 --> 00:12:12.080]  Joe Biden is the personification of the collapsing, rotting,
[00:12:13.826 --> 00:12:25.674]  Worm-eaten facade that is the Democratic Party on the shy, calm, and globalist, fetid, poison tatas, or titans, as they would say in French.
[00:12:25.674 --> 00:12:40.325]  And the disconnect with these people, and they get in the bubbles of their own zombies when they say things like, hell yes, we're going to abolish the Bill of Rights and Constitution, or hell yes, I'm going to start tongue-kissing seven-year-old girls on TV and telling them they make me horny.
[00:12:40.325 --> 00:12:41.005]  There's audio of that.
[00:12:41.005 --> 00:12:41.426]  We've played it.
[00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:46.641]  But then Chris Matthews tells guests, you look really good, and oh, he resigns and he's sorry.
[00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:49.482]  I mean, this is the mind control, drag queen story time.
[00:12:49.482 --> 00:12:56.645]  Little kids bouncing on erect men in clown outfits is okay, as the kids cry.
[00:12:56.645 --> 00:13:00.767]  But if a man says to a woman that's a guest, man, you're looking gorgeous.
[00:13:00.767 --> 00:13:03.468]  You got some great legs.
[00:13:03.468 --> 00:13:06.089]  Well, that's harassment, unless you're Joe Biden.
[00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:08.010]  It's all the bizarre
[00:13:09.804 --> 00:13:15.428]  Hypocrisy and an inversion of normal human activity.
[00:13:15.428 --> 00:13:23.374]  Normal human activity is evil and bad, but aberrant evil behavior is good as mother's milk.
[00:13:23.374 --> 00:13:27.977]  This report's going up on InfoWars.com as we speak and Bandot video.
[00:13:27.977 --> 00:13:29.478]  Please share it.
[00:13:29.478 --> 00:13:37.123]  Joe Biden pledges to appoint Beto as the gun confiscation czar.
[00:13:37.123 --> 00:13:37.584]  Here it is.
[00:13:39.378 --> 00:13:42.921]  I want to make something clear.
[00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:46.444]  I'm going to guarantee you this is not last year's scene of this guy.
[00:13:46.444 --> 00:13:48.847]  You're going to take care of the gun problem with me.
[00:13:48.847 --> 00:13:51.129]  You're going to be the one that leads this effort.
[00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:52.330]  I'm counting on you.
[00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.312]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[00:13:54.312 --> 00:14:00.117]  We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[00:14:00.117 --> 00:14:02.319]  A gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line.
[00:14:02.319 --> 00:14:03.099]  He says, I have an AR-15.
[00:14:04.062 --> 00:14:07.784]  And I will turn this in if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[00:14:07.784 --> 00:14:11.205]  Yes, to answer your question very directly and honestly, yes.
[00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:14.947]  I don't want you to have an AR-15 or an AK-47.
[00:14:14.947 --> 00:14:21.230]  When you were asked how you'd enforce a mandatory buyback, you said police wouldn't be going door-to-door.
[00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:26.052]  So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons?
[00:14:26.052 --> 00:14:28.253]  You don't even know who has those weapons.
[00:14:28.253 --> 00:14:30.134]  So I think almost everyone on this stage
[00:14:30.814 --> 00:14:37.136]  agrees that it's not right and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-15s and AK-47s.
[00:14:37.136 --> 00:14:38.256]  Those are weapons of war.
[00:14:38.256 --> 00:14:42.178]  They were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield.
[00:14:42.178 --> 00:14:49.140]  So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.521]  AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they're also too dangerous to own.
[00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:59.802]  Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror.
[00:14:59.802 --> 00:15:03.603]  I don't know, like, members of the press, what the f***?
[00:15:03.603 --> 00:15:08.384]  I'm incredibly saddened, and it is very hard to think about this.
[00:15:08.384 --> 00:15:10.724]  Um... What a sick freak.
[00:15:10.724 --> 00:15:12.545]  He's smart.
[00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:15.285]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[00:15:15.285 --> 00:15:18.986]  All men and women created by... Go, you know the... You know the thing.
[00:15:20.618 --> 00:15:22.620]  You know the thing.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:33.670]  Can't even say God now, because the demon won't say it.
[00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.873]  I can feel their collapse.
[00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:41.218]  I can feel the human spirit rising to the challenge.
[00:15:41.218 --> 00:15:42.399]  Because when the spirit
[00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:49.764]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[00:15:49.764 --> 00:15:52.347]  Joe Biden wants you to vote on Super Thursday.
[00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:53.248]  I agree, Democrats.
[00:15:53.248 --> 00:15:53.849]  Vote Thursday!
[00:15:58.027 --> 00:16:00.669]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:09.217]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:16:09.217 --> 00:16:16.103]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an

[00:16:47.887 --> 00:16:48.567]  And the best part?
[00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:49.748]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500, $300 or even $200.

[00:16:57.834 --> 00:16:59.796]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:59.796 --> 00:17:05.101]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:17:05.101 --> 00:17:06.703]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:17:06.703 --> 00:17:15.050]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:20.756]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:17:20.896 --> 00:17:22.737]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:17:22.737 --> 00:17:24.897]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:17:24.897 --> 00:17:29.399]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:17:29.399 --> 00:17:31.579]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:17:31.579 --> 00:17:39.442]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:17:59.031 --> 00:18:10.721]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[00:18:10.721 --> 00:18:20.210]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.794]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[00:18:24.794 --> 00:18:25.995]  The globalists have literally
[00:18:26.095 --> 00:18:26.475]  We're good.
[00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.492]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[00:18:51.492 --> 00:18:54.594]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[00:18:54.594 --> 00:18:58.617]  And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[00:18:58.617 --> 00:19:06.943]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[00:19:06.943 --> 00:19:13.908]  And instead of just giving into sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[00:19:13.908 --> 00:19:16.009]  And I say that from personal experience.
[00:19:16.129 --> 00:19:31.036]  Because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day and that power pack that they have, the AM PM power pack, well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:34.718]  I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that
[00:19:34.718 --> 00:19:53.109]  But beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose, for our families and for our communities.
[00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:58.372]  And right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[00:20:01.884 --> 00:20:04.503]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.663 --> 00:20:33.224]  That's right folks, I'm a lone wolf and I ain't no pretty boy.
[00:20:33.224 --> 00:20:35.845]  I'm an American and I'm free and I'm fighting tyranny.
[00:20:35.845 --> 00:20:37.705]  And I want you to be free.
[00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:55.071]  And the folks we have on this broadcast are the folks that have proven they've got a track record of being accurate and knowing what's gonna happen in the future.
[00:20:55.071 --> 00:20:57.492]  The establishment wants to be the only ones
[00:20:59.013 --> 00:21:05.020]  That understand or even have an inkling of projecting the lines.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.887]  But those of us that do the real research and love God are given the discernment.
[00:21:10.887 --> 00:21:12.889]  The enemy is not.
[00:21:12.889 --> 00:21:16.233]  We have the supercomputer God gave us and the spiritual interface.
[00:21:17.267 --> 00:21:22.892]  That when we connect into God and have courage and do the right thing, God gives us the answers.
[00:21:22.892 --> 00:21:23.752]  Evil is not given us.
[00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:31.318]  So they want computers and surveillance and control to try to mimic what God does through us.
[00:21:31.318 --> 00:21:39.285]  Now, Mike Adams is here with us and I can sit here and talk for an hour before he comes on about the coronavirus.
[00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:53.968]  And about how the media has tried to set up a false dichotomy or a false dialectic of either it's totally a hoax and nothing's gonna happen and the virus is harmless or it's the most deadly thing I've ever seen and we're all dead as the end of civilization.
[00:21:53.968 --> 00:21:57.289]  No, the truth is we've seen unprecedented lockdowns in China.
[00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:58.390]  I won't go over all that.
[00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:03.352]  The welding people into houses and shooting people at checkpoints and the UN praising it.
[00:22:03.352 --> 00:22:05.974]  But then if we don't have open borders, oh Trump's bad, the UN says.
[00:22:07.165 --> 00:22:08.865]  We knew a month ago this was big.
[00:22:08.865 --> 00:22:21.768]  Then our sources, we've got a lot of them, and we talked to other people that have sources, confirmed from the Pentagon and from the White House that they declared a secret emergency in the federal government in the agencies that would need to be dealing with that, but not to create a panic a month ago.
[00:22:21.768 --> 00:22:23.469]  Well, that's in the news today.
[00:22:23.469 --> 00:22:26.670]  FEMA preparing for possible coronavirus emergency declaration.
[00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.390]  No, it's already in place.
[00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:33.211]  And we told you the epicenter was Seattle, and we told you that it had already broken containment.
[00:22:33.211 --> 00:22:35.152]  That's Boston Globe yesterday.
[00:22:35.152 --> 00:22:36.472]  So I just want to point out, we're not,
[00:22:38.069 --> 00:22:41.070]  Whistling in the dark here, okay?
[00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.490]  We're not trying to, like, grovel around and find what's going on.
[00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:53.692]  We got a big fat spotlight burning through the lies, crashing through the disinformation, and I'm just blessed to work with all these people.
[00:22:53.692 --> 00:22:56.112]  The crew, the listeners, the guests we've got.
[00:22:56.112 --> 00:23:04.074]  Dr. Francis Boyle, Mike Adams, I mean, I could care less about Hollywood stars or money or power, but let me tell you.
[00:23:05.435 --> 00:23:07.339]  It's not flowing on private jets and all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:07.339 --> 00:23:08.662]  It means nothing.
[00:23:08.662 --> 00:23:14.876]  But man, knowing people that are on fire with truth gives me chills, man.
[00:23:14.876 --> 00:23:16.259]  It's the best thing on earth.
[00:23:17.637 --> 00:23:23.544]  It's better than watching your son knock a home run or your daughter kick the soccer ball into the goal and everybody cheers.
[00:23:23.544 --> 00:23:24.485]  That's great.
[00:23:24.485 --> 00:23:27.129]  But this is humanity winning.
[00:23:27.129 --> 00:23:35.999]  And seeing leaders like Mike Adams and others that we have on this broadcast makes me as a man feel hope when I see the hordes of zombies and those that have fallen to evil.
[00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:36.901]  But they're asleep.
[00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:42.778]  Don't look down on them, and I do it myself and make fun of them because I'm not perfect.
[00:23:42.778 --> 00:23:46.420]  That's my response to laugh at them because it's so upsetting instead of crying.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.543]  So Mike's here with us a few segments to break down the new developments, but the emergency's in place.
[00:23:51.543 --> 00:23:54.485]  As we said a few weeks ago, it'll be deaths by next week.
[00:23:54.485 --> 00:23:56.466]  Now we're next week, six deaths in Washington alone.
[00:23:58.123 --> 00:23:58.984]  It's race specific.
[00:23:58.984 --> 00:23:59.605]  It's man-made.
[00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:02.349]  You gotta treat it very, very seriously, but you don't want to create a panic.
[00:24:02.349 --> 00:24:03.311]  I agree with the President.
[00:24:03.311 --> 00:24:04.472]  Mike, what do you got for us?
[00:24:04.472 --> 00:24:07.337]  I know you were so busy doing research yesterday, you couldn't even come on.
[00:24:07.337 --> 00:24:08.759]  You've got the biggest news yet, I'm told.
[00:24:09.738 --> 00:24:19.467]  Well, I've posted a series of predictions just now, just before coming on the show, of what's going to happen in America, and let me take you back.
[00:24:19.467 --> 00:24:20.808]  Remember the phone call?
[00:24:20.808 --> 00:24:27.874]  I called you about three weeks ago, and I said, Alex, it's already broken in containment in Seattle, but nobody's aware of it.
[00:24:27.874 --> 00:24:29.355]  You said that about a month ago, right?
[00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:30.737]  Yeah, maybe it was a month ago.
[00:24:31.717 --> 00:24:35.638]  And the nation wasn't even ready to hear it at that time.
[00:24:35.638 --> 00:24:37.199]  But think about it, Alex.
[00:24:37.199 --> 00:24:45.202]  A Homeland Security source told me that they knew it had broken containment in Seattle almost a month ago.
[00:24:45.202 --> 00:24:46.342]  Think about that.
[00:24:46.342 --> 00:24:52.604]  Since then, we now know, because of the genetic analysis, it's been spreading for all that time, plus weeks before.
[00:24:52.604 --> 00:24:54.985]  So in total, about a six-week window of spreading.
[00:24:55.925 --> 00:25:01.487]  Scientists now believe there are at least 1,500 infected people in Washington State alone.
[00:25:01.487 --> 00:25:03.567]  And this is also now spreading nationwide.
[00:25:03.567 --> 00:25:11.549]  So part of the big story here is that this is spreading through, in my assessment, domestic air travel.
[00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:20.292]  So the cases in New York, the cases in Miami, the cases in Northern California and other major cities, you know it's in over 10 states across America right now.
[00:25:21.172 --> 00:25:36.057]  In my assessment, this is spreading through domestic air travel and it brings up the possibility that at some point, perhaps after a national emergency is declared, that domestic air travel will have to be severely restricted, especially to cities where there are known outbreaks occurring.
[00:25:36.057 --> 00:25:38.738]  The other big bombshell news here, Alex, and
[00:25:41.145 --> 00:25:43.768]  By the way, we've got some new upgrades here.
[00:25:43.768 --> 00:25:45.470]  I hope the audio is even better than before.
[00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.553]  Video might be a little glitchy, but we're doing great.
[00:25:47.553 --> 00:25:48.114]  No, you're doing great.
[00:25:48.114 --> 00:25:50.217]  I know you've been filming yesterday because you're rebuilding your studio.
[00:25:50.217 --> 00:25:50.978]  It's even better.
[00:25:50.978 --> 00:25:51.739]  That's right.
[00:25:51.739 --> 00:25:53.101]  We're making it better every day.
[00:25:53.101 --> 00:25:54.583]  Houston, we don't have a problem.
[00:25:55.143 --> 00:25:59.545]  Okay, the government is purchasing massive amounts of supplies.
[00:25:59.545 --> 00:26:02.566]  Whether we're talking masks, or personal protection equipment, or food.
[00:26:02.566 --> 00:26:07.308]  That's right, behind the scenes, as I reported over a month ago, five weeks ago, they're grabbing everything up.
[00:26:07.308 --> 00:26:14.290]  And I was even shown the faxes, where they were like, calling up and also sending faxes saying, you need to do this, we might just commandeer you.
[00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.171]  They asked me not to show it on air, but exactly.
[00:26:16.171 --> 00:26:18.152]  That's what we do, the government knew it was a big deal.
[00:26:18.152 --> 00:26:21.953]  Trump's saying everything's fine, but behind the scenes, they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:26:22.153 --> 00:26:29.356]  Well, and then you have the Surgeon General and you have CDC officials and Homeland Security officials telling the public not to get prepared.
[00:26:29.356 --> 00:26:34.378]  Now, I don't know if this is... maybe they're doing this completely outside of Trump's knowledge.
[00:26:34.378 --> 00:26:35.859]  No, they don't want runs.
[00:26:35.859 --> 00:26:37.740]  They want supply to catch up.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.461]  They don't want the images of runs.
[00:26:39.461 --> 00:26:46.764]  So while the government's buying it all up, just like they're doing secretly now that it's admitted, they're telling you don't worry because they don't want that panic.
[00:26:46.764 --> 00:26:48.105]  They don't want the stock market.
[00:26:48.105 --> 00:26:48.845]  That's all it is, Mike.
[00:26:49.105 --> 00:26:49.786]  Right, right.
[00:26:49.786 --> 00:26:51.167]  But think about this.
[00:26:51.167 --> 00:26:59.713]  We have now become the anti-preparedness society, in a sense, at least from those official government sources that are telling people, do not get prepared.
[00:26:59.713 --> 00:27:02.935]  And the media attacking people who talk about preparedness.
[00:27:02.935 --> 00:27:06.878]  This is the most important time to be getting prepared, folks.
[00:27:06.878 --> 00:27:10.560]  If you do not get prepared while the government gets prepared, guess what?
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.141]  You're going to have no food.
[00:27:12.141 --> 00:27:12.962]  They will have all the food.
[00:27:12.962 --> 00:27:13.903]  The military is getting ready.
[00:27:13.903 --> 00:27:15.384]  They're buying masks like crazy.
[00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:18.366]  Mike Pence just did a deal with 3M to produce millions of masks.
[00:27:18.706 --> 00:27:19.406]  Every month.
[00:27:19.406 --> 00:27:22.767]  While the Surgeon General says everybody stop buying masks, they don't work.
[00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:25.188]  And then he says, well, we need them in the hospitals.
[00:27:25.188 --> 00:27:28.149]  So I guess they do work in the hospitals, but somehow they don't work for you.
[00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.829]  Well, you just said it, Mike.
[00:27:28.829 --> 00:27:37.632]  They wanted to go to the government, the emergency system, which is a triage effect, which actually makes sense at a cold-blooded level because if the hospitals break down, they're screwed.
[00:27:37.632 --> 00:27:39.212]  But what you just said is so chilling.
[00:27:39.212 --> 00:27:40.253]  It's all confirmed.
[00:27:40.253 --> 00:27:44.134]  The government, there it is, 3M can't confirm Pence's comments about making more masks.
[00:27:45.295 --> 00:27:47.618]  Again, Pence can't help but try to tell the truth.
[00:27:47.618 --> 00:27:50.061]  I'm not trying to say he's the good guy, Trump's the villain.
[00:27:50.061 --> 00:27:56.850]  This is some 3D chess and I hope Trump's right because he's trying to balance this and then try to ramp up production so there's not a panic.
[00:27:57.691 --> 00:27:58.672]  Well, well, exactly.
[00:27:58.672 --> 00:28:01.234]  And here's the balancing act that has to take place.
[00:28:01.234 --> 00:28:08.461]  So once the isolations begin and the quarantines begin, which are coming, by the way, major regional areas, cities will be under quarantine.
[00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:09.362]  You said it a month ago.
[00:28:09.362 --> 00:28:12.865]  The airlines are fighting over quarantine tracking citizens.
[00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:14.646]  They're preparing the quarantine centers.
[00:28:14.646 --> 00:28:15.067]  It's all here.
[00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:27.277]  So then the question becomes, when parents have to stay home because their children are home from school because the school is locked down, when the paychecks stop, maybe temporarily for people because their workplace is shut down.
[00:28:27.277 --> 00:28:30.760]  Criminals take advantage of the police being overloaded in a few days.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.323]  We're looking at every Democrat city burning.
[00:28:34.323 --> 00:28:35.724]  And most Americans are not prepared.
[00:28:35.724 --> 00:28:41.288]  Most Americans don't even have $500 in emergency savings, and they're being told, don't buy food, don't get ready.
[00:28:41.288 --> 00:28:41.989]  That's really bad advice.
[00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:42.429]  Bingo!
[00:28:42.429 --> 00:28:42.909]  Stay there.
[00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:43.270]  Stay there.
[00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.050]  Because this is where I wanted to go.
[00:28:45.543 --> 00:28:47.085]  I want to get Bill Skousen on the next few days.
[00:28:47.085 --> 00:28:48.346]  He's an expert on this as well.
[00:28:48.346 --> 00:28:49.827]  Because that's really the effect.
[00:28:49.827 --> 00:28:55.453]  Because we'd be fine, folks, except the Democrat media is going to hype up the rioting and crime.
[00:28:55.453 --> 00:28:56.174]  You watch.
[00:28:56.174 --> 00:28:57.915]  This is their plan to drive Trump from office.
[00:28:57.915 --> 00:29:00.418]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain.
[00:29:00.578 --> 00:29:03.641]  The hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:08.766]  Now, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[00:29:08.766 --> 00:29:16.494]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[00:29:16.494 --> 00:29:24.362]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[00:29:24.522 --> 00:29:26.324]  Not a security IPO or note.
[00:29:26.324 --> 00:29:35.831]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[00:29:35.831 --> 00:29:36.672]  Don't miss this one.
[00:29:36.672 --> 00:29:37.993]  Stake your claim today.
[00:29:37.993 --> 00:29:38.253]  Call 800-600-3388.
[00:29:38.253 --> 00:29:38.594]  That's 800-600-3388.
[00:29:38.594 --> 00:29:40.675]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[00:29:40.675 --> 00:29:40.916]  Call now.
[00:29:40.916 --> 00:29:40.996]  800-600-3388.
[00:29:40.996 --> 00:29:41.036]  800-600-3388.
[00:29:52.185 --> 00:30:01.970]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:08.955]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[00:30:08.955 --> 00:30:19.401]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[00:30:19.821 --> 00:30:26.102]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[00:30:26.102 --> 00:30:27.082]  It is back in stock.
[00:30:27.082 --> 00:30:36.304]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[00:30:36.304 --> 00:30:43.746]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[00:30:43.746 --> 00:30:44.206]  And of course,
[00:30:45.086 --> 00:30:51.791]  Vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:57.895]  And they're both back in stock 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:00.387 --> 00:31:03.028]  This should really be easier than it is.
[00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:05.770]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.251]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[00:31:08.251 --> 00:31:16.656]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work, that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[00:31:17.276 --> 00:31:24.985]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic.
[00:31:24.985 --> 00:31:30.010]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen.
[00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.632]  Fluoride's the bad halogen.
[00:31:31.632 --> 00:31:37.659]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.803]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[00:31:43.803 --> 00:31:51.488]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[00:31:51.488 --> 00:31:52.649]  It's amazing.
[00:31:52.649 --> 00:31:56.251]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[00:31:56.251 --> 00:31:57.632]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:11.083]  Across the Western world, from high school to college sports, to even the Olympics, men, biological men, are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:19.769]  This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away, all in the name of liberalism and openness.
[00:32:20.069 --> 00:32:30.632]  And that every day I have stacks of news articles just like today, UK teen fined under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[00:32:30.632 --> 00:32:42.496]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[00:32:42.496 --> 00:32:44.176]  That's the thought police.
[00:32:44.176 --> 00:32:48.958]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[00:32:49.318 --> 00:32:56.889]  This is tyranny, these people are bullies, and it's sick, and it's evil, and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[00:32:56.889 --> 00:32:57.490]  Resist it!
[00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:01.876]  Speak out against it!
[00:33:01.876 --> 00:33:04.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:44.192 --> 00:33:45.296]  I don't know.
[00:34:11.033 --> 00:34:17.054]  We are live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, March 3rd, and I'm interrupting, Mike, and I'm being obnoxious.
[00:34:18.268 --> 00:34:21.250]  But everything he's saying is so true.
[00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.230]  And it's come true.
[00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.991]  And I've got all the articles and everything.
[00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:25.232]  I'm just like, and you're right!
[00:34:25.232 --> 00:34:25.832]  And this!
[00:34:25.832 --> 00:34:26.673]  And that!
[00:34:26.673 --> 00:34:29.154]  So this segment, I'm going to shut up because I want to hear from him.
[00:34:29.154 --> 00:34:30.535]  I want him to get what he has to say.
[00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:32.296]  This guy researches so hard.
[00:34:32.296 --> 00:34:33.817]  He just has a lot of integrity.
[00:34:33.817 --> 00:34:37.699]  He just is really telling you what he believes is going on from the best analysis he's got.
[00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:40.721]  It's been dead on so far, like GPS or something.
[00:34:40.721 --> 00:34:43.042]  So we got nine minutes left in the segment.
[00:34:43.042 --> 00:34:43.643]  I'm going to shut up.
[00:34:43.643 --> 00:34:45.884]  Mike, recap what you said and then get into the other news.
[00:34:45.884 --> 00:34:47.465]  I'm going to turn my microphone off.
[00:34:49.206 --> 00:34:54.353]  Well, if anything, I've been downplaying the numbers that I'm actually running on Excel spreadsheets here.
[00:34:54.353 --> 00:35:01.403]  I've been modeling this myself with the mathematics of it, but I don't even dare say publicly what my numbers show.
[00:35:01.403 --> 00:35:04.868]  No, just say it, because the Pentagon tells me 3 million dead.
[00:35:06.001 --> 00:35:14.429]  Well, yeah, if you have a 50% infection rate and a 2% mortality rate, that's 3.3 million dead Americans over time.
[00:35:14.429 --> 00:35:17.892]  The question is, what time period does this take place in?
[00:35:17.892 --> 00:35:24.038]  Because it's a question of how quickly the hospital beds get taken up, and then you have overrun hospital beds.
[00:35:24.038 --> 00:35:28.622]  Once people are sent home to die, then the death rate explodes to closer to 15, perhaps 17%.
[00:35:30.464 --> 00:35:34.746]  The actual death rates in America, 3.3 million might not be the end of it.
[00:35:34.746 --> 00:35:36.047]  It might be much higher.
[00:35:36.047 --> 00:35:38.028]  Of course, we hope it doesn't get there.
[00:35:38.028 --> 00:35:41.170]  But the CDC, this is the big bombshell news from last night, Alex.
[00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:46.113]  The CDC has now begun hiding the number of Americans that it is testing.
[00:35:46.113 --> 00:35:52.517]  So the coronavirus update page that we've been monitoring for many, many weeks, where they would say how many Americans they tested.
[00:35:52.517 --> 00:35:54.938]  It was 400 and something last week.
[00:35:54.938 --> 00:35:56.499]  They've pulled that number down.
[00:35:56.499 --> 00:35:58.200]  They no longer are willing to admit it.
[00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:05.178]  So we now have the CDC following Communist China, which is just hiding the numbers and lying to the public.
[00:36:05.178 --> 00:36:14.881]  And I believe also, Alex, this is my assessment, I believe that the CDC is, shall we say, deliberately seeding the infection across America.
[00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:18.843]  That these so-called accidental releases are not accidents.
[00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:25.925]  Now, of course, I'm going to be called a conspiracy theorist for saying that, but at some point when you see release after release, mistake after mistake,
[00:36:26.425 --> 00:36:34.212]  When the test kits were bogus and then the CDC ordered labs across America to not test for four weeks almost.
[00:36:34.212 --> 00:36:35.474]  These are not accidents, Alex.
[00:36:35.474 --> 00:36:37.235]  This is part of an actual plan.
[00:36:37.235 --> 00:36:40.458]  This is a deliberate plan to spread the infection across America.
[00:36:40.458 --> 00:36:45.823]  And now, you published this this morning, a story from Michael Snyder, End of the American Dream.
[00:36:45.823 --> 00:36:48.045]  Doctors are begging for tests.
[00:36:48.666 --> 00:36:53.789]  For their patients in New York City and other places, patients that they know or they strongly suspect.
[00:36:53.789 --> 00:37:01.353]  By the way, you said this over three weeks ago, that it was a cover-up, that they sent out a test, that they were not sending out the code of the virus.
[00:37:01.353 --> 00:37:02.233]  Dead on again, Mike.
[00:37:02.233 --> 00:37:03.033]  Dead on.
[00:37:03.033 --> 00:37:03.834]  Yep.
[00:37:03.834 --> 00:37:06.175]  No, it's crazy.
[00:37:06.175 --> 00:37:15.160]  Every day I wake up to the news that you and I were talking about weeks ago, and then also at the same time, the media keeps attacking us as fake news.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.380]  It's like Groundhog Day.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.601]  It's Groundhog Day, isn't it?
[00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:20.874]  Yeah, no, it's absolutely nuts.
[00:37:20.874 --> 00:37:24.538]  But think about this, doctors are begging for tests, and they can't get them.
[00:37:24.538 --> 00:37:32.507]  So, you've got government officials right now, I think even VP Pence said, oh, there's going to be, you know, hundreds of thousands of tests available across America.
[00:37:32.507 --> 00:37:36.191]  Well, if those tests aren't in the hands of doctors, it's pointless, doesn't matter.
[00:37:36.952 --> 00:37:41.555]  The tests still aren't getting done at the local level, even though that's getting ramped up.
[00:37:41.555 --> 00:37:50.100]  So what we're going to see, Alex, this week, we're going to see, my prediction is, many tens of cases, more confirmations, tens of cases.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:56.384]  Next week, I'm calling it dozens, if not hundreds, and certainly by the week after, many hundreds of cases.
[00:37:56.384 --> 00:38:00.827]  And then the week after that, or the subsequent several weeks, there will be thousands of cases.
[00:38:00.827 --> 00:38:03.109]  There will be over 100,000 infections in America within 90 days.
[00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:10.373]  So that's my prediction here, and that's not even what my numbers are telling me is the worst case.
[00:38:10.373 --> 00:38:11.834]  That's kind of a conservative case.
[00:38:11.834 --> 00:38:13.915]  So think about 100,000 infections.
[00:38:13.915 --> 00:38:17.097]  So you start to talk about thousands of deaths in America.
[00:38:17.097 --> 00:38:18.858]  No wonder FEMA is getting ready.
[00:38:18.858 --> 00:38:20.899]  No wonder the Department of Defense is getting ready.
[00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:22.600]  You talked about this on your show yesterday.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:30.364]  You, you know, was a military intelligence person who told you they are preparing for the possibility of millions of deaths in America.
[00:38:30.364 --> 00:38:31.785]  I got a call over the weekend from a
[00:38:32.125 --> 00:38:38.129]  Current Lieutenant Colonel, really good guy, an Army Special Operations, so it's actually at the tip of the spear.
[00:38:38.129 --> 00:38:43.031]  And they're like, no, they believe it's a 2% kill rate, and they're telling us, get ready for 3 million dead.
[00:38:43.031 --> 00:38:45.273]  So you know, this is not a hoax.
[00:38:45.273 --> 00:38:46.433]  The virus is real.
[00:38:46.433 --> 00:38:50.156]  We don't want to panic, though, but we need people that obviously know that this is real.
[00:38:50.156 --> 00:38:57.020]  Because they kind of want the hardcore patriots that are serious people to know, for whatever reason.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.360]  I wasn't called and told this.
[00:38:59.841 --> 00:39:02.783]  On his own volition over telephone.
[00:39:02.783 --> 00:39:10.869]  And then I just so happened to have another lieutenant colonel who was in Army Special Operations at my house with some business we were conducting.
[00:39:10.869 --> 00:39:12.009]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:39:12.009 --> 00:39:13.070]  And I had to go to work.
[00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:18.854]  He was there with my wife and she calls up going, hey, you know, what's his name?
[00:39:18.854 --> 00:39:22.096]  Kelly's saying that he hears from people they think it's going to be $3 million.
[00:39:22.096 --> 00:39:24.958]  So the Pentagon really thinks it's $3 million.
[00:39:26.065 --> 00:39:28.986]  And so, because they're not going to tell them BS.
[00:39:28.986 --> 00:39:30.327]  I mean, they need to know what's going on.
[00:39:30.327 --> 00:39:32.768]  I get why Trump doesn't want to take the stock market.
[00:39:32.768 --> 00:39:37.369]  Obviously, the Chai comms release it to clamp down on their own people and to bring us down as well.
[00:39:37.369 --> 00:39:44.992]  So I think working from that prognosis, that hypothesis, what we've been working on, I think it's becoming clear that is what it is.
[00:39:44.992 --> 00:39:53.135]  Well, remember too, early on, I said that China would begin harvesting this and actually trying to deposit it into cities across America.
[00:39:53.135 --> 00:39:55.456]  I think we've already been under attack.
[00:39:56.076 --> 00:40:01.762]  I think that some of these outbreaks that we're seeing are because China was trying to export the virus.
[00:40:01.762 --> 00:40:10.572]  China, in my opinion, was trying to get Taiwan infected and Japan infected and Korea and so on, so that China could shift focus from itself.
[00:40:10.572 --> 00:40:16.478]  While China starts fudging the numbers, then all the other countries around the world who are reporting more honest numbers, such as South Korea,
[00:40:16.798 --> 00:40:17.700]  We're good to go.
[00:40:31.837 --> 00:40:32.278]  Well, right.
[00:40:32.278 --> 00:40:32.758]  Exactly.
[00:40:32.758 --> 00:40:34.241]  And so, here's what's happened.
[00:40:34.241 --> 00:40:40.370]  You know, Trump did a good thing by blocking Chinese nationals from entering the United States.
[00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:41.952]  However, it was too late.
[00:40:41.952 --> 00:40:43.034]  It was already here.
[00:40:43.034 --> 00:40:47.561]  So, now... And that means the CDC covered that up, because if folks don't know... Yes.
[00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:50.342]  The CDC's got surveillance on this.
[00:40:50.342 --> 00:40:51.483]  They're not incompetent.
[00:40:51.483 --> 00:40:52.304]  They're just evil.
[00:40:52.304 --> 00:40:53.144]  They're watching.
[00:40:53.144 --> 00:40:54.365]  They're truly evil.
[00:40:54.365 --> 00:40:55.926]  They're malicious.
[00:40:55.926 --> 00:41:02.430]  The CDC knew two weeks ago that there were a thousand cases in America and they chose not to share that information.
[00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.250]  And let's go back.
[00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.171]  It came out on 2020.
[00:41:04.171 --> 00:41:15.998]  In 2002, back when the media was still somewhat truthful, at least a little bit, that the head of the CDC found out that millions have been given autism and he says, I'm going to tell my kids not to give the grandkids this.
[00:41:17.479 --> 00:41:20.885]  And by the way, if the public finds out they're gonna kill us, we gotta clean this up.
[00:41:20.885 --> 00:41:22.747]  Those transcripts came out in Congress.
[00:41:22.747 --> 00:41:23.088]  Right.
[00:41:23.088 --> 00:41:24.069]  And nothing was ever done.
[00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:26.413]  So, the CDC, just like the U.N.
[00:41:26.413 --> 00:41:29.277]  whistleblowers, no vaccines are hurting people, they're covering it up.
[00:41:29.277 --> 00:41:30.900]  So, this is just out of control.
[00:41:31.732 --> 00:41:42.515]  Well, exactly, and where it's going is really about every nightmare apocalypse scenario that you can imagine, and preppers are going to be the geniuses in this already.
[00:41:42.515 --> 00:41:48.157]  It's now apparent people who have been prepping for years are the geniuses, and it's the unprepared who are clueless or oblivious.
[00:41:48.737 --> 00:41:53.618]  But we're going to see supply lines just cratering even more.
[00:41:53.618 --> 00:41:57.379]  You and I have seen this because we're both in the food and products business.
[00:41:57.379 --> 00:42:02.079]  So we see at the commercial level that things are just collapsing across the board.
[00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:02.779]  Just collapsing.
[00:42:02.779 --> 00:42:06.240]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.241]  I'm not even sure, Alex, how much longer I can operate my operation.
[00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:13.061]  I can function.
[00:42:13.061 --> 00:42:14.742]  I might have to temporarily shut it down.
[00:42:14.742 --> 00:42:16.062]  Might be for months.
[00:42:16.062 --> 00:42:16.582]  I don't even know.
[00:42:17.522 --> 00:42:20.284]  And by the way, honesty is our secret weapon.
[00:42:20.284 --> 00:42:21.964]  That's our superpower.
[00:42:21.964 --> 00:42:23.505]  All the other food stores are sold out.
[00:42:23.505 --> 00:42:25.026]  They've been sold out for over a month.
[00:42:25.026 --> 00:42:26.267]  They sold out to FEMA.
[00:42:26.267 --> 00:42:27.407]  We told you that.
[00:42:27.407 --> 00:42:29.328]  Our folks are six to eight weeks.
[00:42:29.328 --> 00:42:34.631]  And people at first went to other places that came back because they found out, yeah, that is scary.
[00:42:34.631 --> 00:42:35.451]  Exactly.
[00:42:35.451 --> 00:42:39.133]  And we're in the position within a week or two, they're telling me, you're going to have to stop selling food.
[00:42:39.133 --> 00:42:40.113]  And they are too.
[00:42:40.113 --> 00:42:43.215]  So yeah, that is where we are, folks.
[00:42:43.215 --> 00:42:44.696]  And FEMA bought it all up.
[00:42:45.236 --> 00:42:48.021]  From everybody else, you think they're concerned?
[00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:53.611]  We're gonna talk about the societal breakdown and what could happen and how to get prepared for it when we come back.
[00:42:53.611 --> 00:42:54.272]  Stay with us.
[00:42:58.536 --> 00:43:02.537]  It's really smart to get high quality, storable food at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:02.537 --> 00:43:06.259]  It's also smart to drink filtered water with an Alexa Pure system.

[00:43:34.627 --> 00:43:36.688]  This is our flagship product.
[00:43:36.688 --> 00:43:39.849]  I'm so proud of it, and I had run out of it as well.
[00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:43.269]  So when I got it last week, when it came back in, I was so excited.
[00:43:43.269 --> 00:43:45.930]  It's now available at Infowarsore.com.
[00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:51.691]  You're getting a wonderful formula, and it funds the information war with the important fight that we're carrying out
[00:43:53.512 --> 00:44:04.421]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[00:44:04.421 --> 00:44:15.009]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in the
[00:44:15.509 --> 00:44:24.836]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.

[00:45:00.801 --> 00:45:01.962]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[00:45:01.962 --> 00:45:07.447]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[00:45:07.447 --> 00:45:10.310]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:12.012]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[00:45:12.012 --> 00:45:15.255]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[00:45:15.795 --> 00:45:19.657]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[00:45:19.657 --> 00:45:20.898]  20 different stickers.
[00:45:20.898 --> 00:45:22.519]  Impeach the Democrats.
[00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:23.600]  Save the Second Amendment.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.680]  Defend the First Amendment.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.001]  Infowars.com.
[00:45:26.001 --> 00:45:28.182]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[00:45:28.182 --> 00:45:32.925]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[00:45:32.925 --> 00:45:34.546]  People say, why are you doing this?
[00:45:34.546 --> 00:45:35.066]  What's happening?
[00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:38.828]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored and, you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[00:45:38.828 --> 00:45:41.950]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:42.971]  Brilliant.
[00:45:42.971 --> 00:45:50.082]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[00:45:50.082 --> 00:45:53.027]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[00:45:53.027 --> 00:45:55.851]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[00:45:55.851 --> 00:45:56.552]  Silence.
[00:45:58.487 --> 00:45:59.268]  Everybody needs food.
[00:45:59.268 --> 00:46:00.829]  I'm proud we're selling high quality food.
[00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:06.094]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble, this is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[00:46:06.094 --> 00:46:10.658]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food.
[00:46:10.658 --> 00:46:19.126]  And I had long discussions this morning, over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this, right down to the folks who run the plants, to get the best idea we have.
[00:46:19.126 --> 00:46:19.787]  But they want me to say
[00:46:19.967 --> 00:46:21.048]  Six to eight weeks.
[00:46:21.048 --> 00:46:22.688]  Just so people aren't getting pissed.
[00:46:22.688 --> 00:46:28.951]  But understand, the last food company, the biggest food company, is now at hundreds of times their regular order.
[00:46:28.951 --> 00:46:33.573]  And they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week.
[00:46:33.573 --> 00:46:35.434]  And at a certain point just saying, we're done.
[00:46:35.434 --> 00:46:37.915]  Because people aren't going to take food orders out ten weeks.
[00:46:37.915 --> 00:46:40.036]  We don't want to sit on your money ten weeks.
[00:46:40.036 --> 00:46:41.717]  And then just all the weirdness that comes with that.
[00:46:41.717 --> 00:46:42.618]  Because we're honest.
[00:46:42.618 --> 00:46:43.318]  Under promise.
[00:46:43.578 --> 00:46:45.199]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:30.966]  The sword of truth is white hot.
[00:47:30.966 --> 00:47:32.627]  The news breaking is insane.
[00:47:32.627 --> 00:47:46.675]  I have hundreds of incredible articles I want to get to, but we'll do it after Mike Adams is gone.
[00:47:46.675 --> 00:47:47.576]  Get all ties together.
[00:47:47.576 --> 00:47:49.757]  This just broke the New York Post.
[00:47:49.757 --> 00:47:54.120]  Top US doctor says coronavirus now an outbreak, possibly a pandemic.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.281]  We said that a month ago.
[00:47:58.281 --> 00:48:00.722]  You don't see China completely.
[00:48:00.722 --> 00:48:01.923]  I'm gonna say this again.
[00:48:01.923 --> 00:48:04.244]  You don't see.
[00:48:04.244 --> 00:48:06.925]  You don't see.
[00:48:06.925 --> 00:48:09.746]  You don't see.
[00:48:09.746 --> 00:48:10.847]  You don't see.
[00:48:10.847 --> 00:48:12.727]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:48:12.727 --> 00:48:14.808]  Top link in red.
[00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:17.109]  Foushee.
[00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:22.071]  You don't see China shut down all its major cities and kill all that trade.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:23.332]  Billions an hour.
[00:48:25.225 --> 00:48:29.586]  Unless something begs up, whether it's fake or whether it's real.
[00:48:29.586 --> 00:48:32.506]  It's big.
[00:48:32.506 --> 00:48:34.667]  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that.
[00:48:34.667 --> 00:48:38.087]  That's why I said a month ago, they're going to clear grocery store shelves off.
[00:48:38.087 --> 00:48:41.688]  I told those food suppliers, I said, buy everything you get your hands on.
[00:48:41.688 --> 00:48:46.809]  And they're like, yeah, we're glad you, I mean.
[00:48:46.809 --> 00:48:49.329]  This is insane.
[00:48:49.329 --> 00:48:52.510]  This is the move on the global economy that the globalists are using for control.
[00:48:53.669 --> 00:48:58.530]  So I'm going to say it, yeah, you order food from us, we've got the only big company that's still got it.
[00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:04.052]  You're going to wait five to eight weeks to get it, depending on what you order.
[00:49:04.052 --> 00:49:05.752]  I don't know how these BSers operate.
[00:49:05.752 --> 00:49:09.333]  Even established companies are in crises.
[00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:13.514]  We'll just tell you, we're going to get to you in 10 days.
[00:49:13.514 --> 00:49:15.414]  And they know damn well they don't even have the food.
[00:49:15.414 --> 00:49:16.575]  We got the food.
[00:49:16.575 --> 00:49:17.675]  We can't package it.
[00:49:18.916 --> 00:49:21.318]  And get it all approved and go through all the bureaucracy.
[00:49:21.318 --> 00:49:22.519]  They bought more plants.
[00:49:22.519 --> 00:49:24.120]  They've everything.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:32.888]  I couldn't imagine a relationship where you tell your daughter, I'm going to pick you up at school today, sweetheart, at four o'clock and you never show up.
[00:49:32.888 --> 00:49:37.332]  Or you tell your kid in the pool, jump in my hands and you just like step aside and they fall on their face.
[00:49:37.332 --> 00:49:38.593]  But that's what Satanists do.
[00:49:38.593 --> 00:49:41.095]  They get off on that.
[00:49:41.095 --> 00:49:42.896]  I don't do that.
[00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:45.599]  And yeah, we saw food sales go like this when I told you six to eight weeks.
[00:49:47.056 --> 00:49:52.979]  But then people went out and checked and found out that nobody's delivering food, that we were being accurate, and the sales went right back up.
[00:49:52.979 --> 00:49:54.219]  Huh!
[00:49:54.219 --> 00:50:00.742]  Does it make me feel good to get some money in here to fund operations and be able to hire some people and launch some really cool things behind the scenes?
[00:50:00.742 --> 00:50:04.304]  Because whatever you see in what we're doing, there's a lot you don't know about.
[00:50:04.304 --> 00:50:05.904]  And it's fun.
[00:50:05.904 --> 00:50:08.665]  Maybe someday I'll write a book about it, after this has all been over.
[00:50:08.665 --> 00:50:12.467]  But don't just hate me for what we do on air here, folks.
[00:50:12.467 --> 00:50:13.307]  We're like a Hydra.
[00:50:13.307 --> 00:50:15.128]  I mean, we've got a lot of ads.
[00:50:15.128 --> 00:50:16.409]  A lot of stuff you see out there,
[00:50:18.308 --> 00:50:20.329]  Is you, it's not me.
[00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:28.931]  You give us the money and I will deliver it to the front lines as expertly as I can to attack the enemy because I'm fully committed.
[00:50:28.931 --> 00:50:33.072]  All I care about is winning this war against these devil worshippers.
[00:50:33.072 --> 00:50:41.554]  So get your DNA Force Plus that's back in stock that amazingly boosts your immune system by cleaning out your cells and bringing them to optimum sufficiency and creates a new mitochondria.
[00:50:41.554 --> 00:50:42.435]  Nothing else can do that.
[00:50:42.435 --> 00:50:43.975]  It's got all that we can make claims.
[00:50:43.975 --> 00:50:46.996]  It's PQQ, it's CoQ10 and then things that supercharge it.
[00:50:48.643 --> 00:50:52.206]  That are known to do it, but have not been approved, but it's all there.
[00:50:52.206 --> 00:50:59.871]  And get your Vitamin Mineral Fusion that you take as a vitamin and mineral, but as a fruit punch, you absorb it better.
[00:50:59.871 --> 00:51:03.594]  And get your Ultra 12 and get it all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:51:03.594 --> 00:51:11.420]  And if we raise prices on the Nano Silver Toothpaste, no, we cut prices during the crisis, even though it's about to sell out.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.721]  So get your Super Silver Toothpaste.
[00:51:13.721 --> 00:51:15.202]  Get it all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:51:15.202 --> 00:51:15.563]  And yes,
[00:51:16.465 --> 00:51:21.168]  Yes, get your orders in for the storable food, and you will get it.
[00:51:21.168 --> 00:51:23.109]  Because they can't tell you, it's whatever you ordered.
[00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:24.831]  Some things are six weeks, some things are five weeks.
[00:51:24.831 --> 00:51:28.033]  They're just saying eight weeks to be safe, or six to eight weeks.
[00:51:28.033 --> 00:51:32.415]  But you're actually ordering from someone who actually has it.
[00:51:32.415 --> 00:51:43.663]  And the reason you do that is not because of this crisis, but because of the economy, and the world, and inflation, and just having food the last 25 years that's high quality and tastes great, and it's there and it's taken care of, and then it funds the info war.
[00:51:43.663 --> 00:51:45.024]  So yes, it's a win-win.
[00:51:50.997 --> 00:51:54.139]  But, this is the globalist attack on nation states.
[00:51:54.139 --> 00:52:12.492]  Mike Adams, in the six minutes we have left, getting into other facets of this, you mentioned it, and for me, that's when I wake up, I woke up at 1am this morning after going to bed, I went to bed early, like 9 o'clock last night, I was tired, I went to bed at like 9, I woke up at 1, couldn't sleep, went and had some orange juice, some water, couldn't go to bed, took some knockout, stayed up about an hour, went to bed, and
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:20.583]  I was just thinking, what happens if Chinese and Japanese cities are very orderly and they're having problems?
[00:52:20.583 --> 00:52:24.645]  What happens in a societal breakdown or deliveries?
[00:52:24.645 --> 00:52:27.146]  The supply chain, as you said, is already wrecked.
[00:52:27.146 --> 00:52:28.006]  That is a fact.
[00:52:28.006 --> 00:52:28.726]  That's going on.
[00:52:28.726 --> 00:52:29.987]  What does that do?
[00:52:29.987 --> 00:52:31.207]  What do you expect to see?
[00:52:31.207 --> 00:52:39.031]  And then projecting out, first question, first, what is your projection on when the virus peaks in North America?
[00:52:40.967 --> 00:52:44.808]  Well, it may not peak for another year or even 18 months.
[00:52:44.808 --> 00:52:45.709]  It depends.
[00:52:45.709 --> 00:52:55.652]  You know, some of the methods that we're using in the United States can slow the spread of the virus, and that's actually key, to slow the number of infections so that the hospitals don't get overrun.
[00:52:56.272 --> 00:53:01.217]  We are better at that here in America than, of course, Africa or many other nations around the world.
[00:53:01.217 --> 00:53:04.621]  So, when Trump says we're more prepared, that's what he's referring to.
[00:53:04.621 --> 00:53:12.189]  However, if we're not running the test, then we don't have the intelligence to crack down on the local, the community outbreaks, as they're called.
[00:53:12.629 --> 00:53:17.555]  So this could take, actually, this could reverberate for a couple of years, Alex.
[00:53:17.555 --> 00:53:20.679]  This could, it may go down this summer, possibly.
[00:53:20.679 --> 00:53:22.802]  That's being talked about, although we don't know.
[00:53:22.802 --> 00:53:26.907]  People know the flu goes away in the summer, but we don't know, does the coronavirus go away?
[00:53:26.907 --> 00:53:28.388]  I'm not convinced it will.
[00:53:28.388 --> 00:53:31.873]  But if it does, then it could come back with a resurgence in the winter.
[00:53:32.353 --> 00:53:49.504]  So, right after the election, if the election is even held, and this is one of my concerns, Alex, that there may be so many cities under lockdown and quarantine by the time we get to election day that there will be calls from the Democrats to postpone the election because not enough Democrats can participate.
[00:53:49.504 --> 00:53:53.647]  By the way, you said that three weeks ago, and then now this week that's in the news.
[00:53:53.647 --> 00:53:59.211]  They're already going, oh, will this affect Super Tuesday today or Super Thursday if you're Joe Biden, or should we?
[00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:00.512]  What should happen?
[00:54:00.512 --> 00:54:01.673]  Should we suspend the election?
[00:54:01.673 --> 00:54:03.634]  Because they know they're about to get their ass kicked.
[00:54:03.634 --> 00:54:05.516]  This is their Qaikom globalist move.
[00:54:05.516 --> 00:54:06.717]  It's so obvious now.
[00:54:06.717 --> 00:54:07.357]  They did this.
[00:54:07.357 --> 00:54:09.579]  They released this.
[00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:15.824]  No, I want to beat Joe Biden, 49 states to one, as soon as possible.
[00:54:15.824 --> 00:54:17.246]  So I don't want to delay the election.
[00:54:17.246 --> 00:54:20.508]  I mean, let's let's beat Joe Biden politically right now.
[00:54:20.508 --> 00:54:21.389]  That's the thing to do.
[00:54:21.389 --> 00:54:24.952]  But but Alex, let me talk about some of the things that people need to be doing for preparedness.
[00:54:24.952 --> 00:54:26.113]  This is really practical.
[00:54:26.113 --> 00:54:28.495]  Let's talk about individuals to take action on.
[00:54:29.055 --> 00:54:47.800]  So we've been monitoring Amazon supplies for various products, and as of yesterday, my staff informed me that nearly all the vitamin C was sold out of Amazon, and all the isopropyl alcohol, what we call IPA, in the lab, which you can mix with water to make a sanitizing spray, that it's all sold out.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:53.422]  There might be pieces that come back online, you know, every few hours, but then they're immediately sold out as well.
[00:54:53.422 --> 00:54:55.422]  But folks, here's what you need to be getting.
[00:54:55.422 --> 00:54:57.883]  Povidone iodine, isopropyl alcohol,
[00:54:58.323 --> 00:55:02.587]  Ammonium chloride, sodium hypochlorite, which is bleach, of course.
[00:55:02.587 --> 00:55:05.610]  Hydrogen peroxide, you can put that in a nebulizer.
[00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:13.037]  You can, of course, inhale some of that if it's at a low concentration, such as 3% mixed with air.
[00:55:13.037 --> 00:55:23.247]  Colloidal silver, and I want to mention, Alex, your silver that you sell, people can buy that, they can put it in a sprayer, and you can lightly mist the inside of a mask.
[00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:30.454]  So if you're wearing an N95 mask, you can lightly mist that mask on the inside and the outside with colloidal silver.
[00:55:30.454 --> 00:55:31.455]  This is so key.
[00:55:31.455 --> 00:55:39.923]  No one's telling you, use the mask not just as a filter, but as an antiviral system where you've got troops there.
[00:55:39.923 --> 00:55:43.166]  It's not just a wall, it's troops with guns to shoot the viruses.
[00:55:43.706 --> 00:55:53.874]  That's right, and people need to be aware that if you walk through an area that may be contaminated and then you remove the mask, that is when you get infected if you're not careful.
[00:55:53.874 --> 00:56:00.279]  So even before you remove the mask, you should of course have latex gloves on that are one-time use only.
[00:56:00.279 --> 00:56:03.642]  Many of these masks should be one-time use, but if you're going to try to reuse it,
[00:56:04.142 --> 00:56:06.463]  Then you need to be very careful in how you handle it.
[00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.064]  You have to sterilize it.
[00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:11.185]  Sunlight can sterilize these things, by the way, over time.
[00:56:11.185 --> 00:56:17.088]  Obviously heat, like an incubation with heat, with steam can kill it.
[00:56:17.088 --> 00:56:21.691]  And silver, topically, can kill many pathogens on surfaces.
[00:56:22.751 --> 00:56:26.412]  But what about boosting your immune system with like iodine?
[00:56:26.412 --> 00:56:26.873]  Absolutely.
[00:56:26.873 --> 00:56:28.813]  With elderberry?
[00:56:28.813 --> 00:56:29.694]  With turmeric?
[00:56:29.694 --> 00:56:30.034]  What else?
[00:56:30.034 --> 00:56:31.154]  All these things.
[00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:32.415]  There's iodine.
[00:56:32.415 --> 00:56:40.558]  The research that I've seen talks about high-dose vitamin C. There's a molecule called phycocyanin that's in spirulina that's been shown to be effective.
[00:56:40.558 --> 00:56:43.279]  Iodine is an absolute must in every case.
[00:56:43.279 --> 00:56:45.620]  A licorice root contains an antiviral molecule called glycerin.
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:51.342]  By the way, about two months ago before this started, I'm not trying to be weird here, it's true, I literally got transmissions from God.
[00:56:52.282 --> 00:56:54.304]  It was like, you must promote spirulina.
[00:56:54.304 --> 00:56:57.906]  We don't even really sell that.
[00:56:57.906 --> 00:57:00.768]  I literally was being told, spirulina, spirulina.
[00:57:00.768 --> 00:57:02.289]  And I told my wife, I was like, what's up?
[00:57:02.289 --> 00:57:04.931]  Folks, I'm not trying to be weird here.
[00:57:04.931 --> 00:57:07.433]  I had dreams of 9-11 and the smoking towers before it happened.
[00:57:07.433 --> 00:57:08.694]  I went on air and told everybody.
[00:57:08.694 --> 00:57:09.515]  People saw that.
[00:57:09.515 --> 00:57:11.736]  It's like, I just kept getting told, spirulina, spirulina.
[00:57:11.736 --> 00:57:13.137]  We don't even really sell that.
[00:57:13.137 --> 00:57:14.098]  But what is spirulina?
[00:57:14.098 --> 00:57:14.839]  Is that like plankton?
[00:57:15.558 --> 00:57:19.122]  Well, no, it's a blue-green algae, and it contains very powerful molecules.
[00:57:19.122 --> 00:57:29.395]  But look, before we go to break, we need to say, as a disclaimer, nothing has been proven against the coronavirus, but all these things I mentioned are very likely candidates for undergoing additional testing.
[00:57:29.395 --> 00:57:31.097]  Exactly, don't just try to block the virus.
[00:57:31.758 --> 00:57:33.479]  Defend your immune system.
[00:57:33.479 --> 00:57:34.199]  Drink water.
[00:57:34.199 --> 00:57:34.739]  We can say that.
[00:57:34.739 --> 00:57:35.679]  Without water, you die.
[00:57:35.679 --> 00:57:36.800]  I don't care what the FDA says.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.660]  You need water and oxygen.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:39.841]  Mike Adams, thank you so much.
[00:57:39.841 --> 00:57:40.481]  Amazing job.
[00:57:40.481 --> 00:57:41.721]  NaturalNews.com.
[00:57:41.721 --> 00:57:43.462]  We're with InfoWars.com.
[00:57:43.462 --> 00:57:44.622]  Spread those links.
[00:57:44.622 --> 00:57:45.743]  Ban.Video.
[00:57:45.743 --> 00:57:46.103]  Ban.Video.
[00:57:47.836 --> 00:57:49.678]  We always promote being prepared.
[00:57:49.678 --> 00:57:53.280]  Having firearms, knowing how to use them, and being self-sufficient.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.622]  And learn how to hunt, and learn how to garden.
[00:57:55.622 --> 00:57:57.164]  I mean, it's just, it's what we're meant to do.
[00:57:57.164 --> 00:57:58.385]  It feels good when we do it.
[00:57:58.385 --> 00:58:00.286]  But we do sell high-quality, affordable food.
[00:58:00.286 --> 00:58:03.389]  I told my Patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[00:58:03.389 --> 00:58:04.490]  I said, I think this is going to be really big.
[00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:05.891]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:09.193]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[00:58:09.193 --> 00:58:10.494]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge.
[00:58:10.494 --> 00:58:14.498]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[00:58:14.498 --> 00:58:15.759]  So those are the type of discussions we have.
[00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:17.440]  And I'm just giving you the inside baseball of all of this.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.683]  This is a hundred times regular volume plus.
[00:58:20.683 --> 00:58:22.204]  It was a hundred times a few days ago.
[00:58:22.204 --> 00:58:24.006]  Now it's about 200 times, okay?
[00:58:24.006 --> 00:58:27.489]  At InfoWarsTore.com, you go right in the queue where it's come first serve.
[00:58:27.489 --> 00:58:31.393]  But the fact that the orders are so ultramassive, it's dizzying.
[00:58:31.393 --> 00:58:32.794]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:58:32.794 --> 00:58:40.061]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe, and then if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[00:58:40.061 --> 00:58:43.524]  But everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food, but that's how big this is.
[00:58:43.765 --> 00:58:46.590]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on.

[00:59:52.375 --> 00:59:58.299]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.299 --> 01:00:00.921]  Bernie Sanders, 48%.
[01:00:00.921 --> 01:00:02.222]  Just behind Bloomberg for me.
[01:00:02.222 --> 01:00:08.686]  They don't want Sanders out of the Democrat Party, but he's clearly the frontrunner with grassroots support.
[01:00:08.686 --> 01:00:11.628]  I just don't think he has the will to turn that into a victory.
[01:00:11.628 --> 01:00:14.030]  So I think he's still trailing Bloomberg in that department.
[01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:16.091]  The Democrats would ultimately rather go with Bloomberg.
[01:00:16.091 --> 01:00:16.932]  He's got the cash.
[01:00:18.112 --> 01:00:23.194]  And he is a Democrat, at least in name, Sanders independent in the Vermont Senate seat.
[01:00:23.194 --> 01:00:25.916]  And then there's Warren who, why is she still on the board?
[01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:27.456]  Nobody really knows.
[01:00:27.456 --> 01:00:29.657]  She's a 0% chance.
[01:00:29.657 --> 01:00:38.101]  So the first level, you have innate bias from if it's left or right or somewhere in the middle that can affect the way you think.
[01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:43.924]  The second level against Trump was an engineered bias, which was created by Chinese intel groups.
[01:00:44.927 --> 01:00:51.172]  And source funded think tanks, and also multiple other entities, right?
[01:00:51.172 --> 01:00:59.619]  The third level was actually the proximity sensors and the apps inside that increase people's emotional reactions.
[01:00:59.619 --> 01:01:03.562]  Because what it does is connects with your neural networks in your nervous system.
[01:01:03.562 --> 01:01:06.944]  When it does this, it increases your
[01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:14.190]  Or you could even increase your like, but for the most part, it increases your hate, because it hits certain emotional areas.
[01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:15.351]  And there's patents for this.
[01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:19.434]  What I find fascinating with this coronavirus is the timing of it, Owen.
[01:01:19.434 --> 01:01:24.597]  If you think about it, Hong Kong was taking place, we don't hear anything more about it, right?
[01:01:24.597 --> 01:01:26.218]  It's just gone off the front pages.
[01:01:26.218 --> 01:01:34.144]  No, actually, the only thing I've heard about it is we had a caller who works in shipping said, we're sending more masks and stuff to Hong Kong than ever before.
[01:01:34.144 --> 01:01:35.585]  It's not even being reported.
[01:01:37.921 --> 01:01:38.862]  It's not even being reported.
[01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:48.514]  The more interesting thing is, six months before this virus hit, in Wuhan itself, which is a city in the Hubei province, a lot of people really need to research this.
[01:01:48.514 --> 01:01:51.578]  The New York Times had one report, even all the mainstream media did.
[01:01:51.578 --> 01:01:55.062]  In Wuhan, Owen, there was massive protest taking place.
[01:01:55.723 --> 01:01:56.163]  Massive.
[01:01:56.163 --> 01:02:02.966]  Now remember, in China, you don't go out and protest because you get shot or you're going to be, you know, thrown in jail.
[01:02:02.966 --> 01:02:04.107]  Why did they protest?
[01:02:04.107 --> 01:02:08.789]  Well, China has a major garbage problem, sanitation problem.
[01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:11.610]  They can't handle their sanitation.
[01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:15.152]  Yeah, they quit buying our waste actually a couple months ago because of this.
[01:02:16.678 --> 01:02:25.244]  Exactly, but they have so much sanitation problems, a lot of plastic, so you know what their solution was to burn it in mass incinerators.
[01:02:25.244 --> 01:02:26.686]  Now they're allowed to burn it to pollute.
[01:02:26.686 --> 01:02:28.247]  Oh, that's great.
[01:02:28.247 --> 01:02:31.029]  Exactly, and the Paris Accords allows them to pollute.
[01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:33.010]  They can pollute massively.
[01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:42.958]  In Wuhan, the city, they were going to build one of the largest incinerators, and the people said to hell with this, and because of the toxic fumes, so they took to the streets.
[01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:44.419]  10,000 people protested, Owen.
[01:02:45.009 --> 01:02:45.109]  Okay.
[01:03:01.039 --> 01:03:04.640]  A communist party is polluting and killing its own people.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.362]  They're rising up, Hong Kong is rising up, and people in the United States are rising up, right?
[01:03:10.362 --> 01:03:12.222]  Against the whole vaccine mandates.
[01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:15.703]  So, when is... I call it bio-media warfare.
[01:03:15.703 --> 01:03:23.586]  What beauty, whether it happened naturally, or whether it was engineered, it's a beautiful timing to suppress all this dissent.
[01:03:23.586 --> 01:03:29.128]  The Wuhan protests go away, and if you see a lot of these people who are being attacked in Wuhan, they look absolutely healthy.
[01:03:29.128 --> 01:03:30.508]  They look like they were dissenters.
[01:03:31.467 --> 01:03:38.911]  Hong Kong has gone away and this gives the awesome pretext now for the US government to say we need mandatory vaccines.
[01:03:38.911 --> 01:03:39.472]  Right?
[01:03:39.472 --> 01:03:46.056]  Because the movement for immunity, real health is starting to grow in this country.
[01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:47.516]  People are waking up.
[01:03:47.516 --> 01:03:49.898]  So this is an amazing opportunity for the CDC
[01:03:50.942 --> 01:03:53.282]  To really impose its will back on people.
[01:03:53.282 --> 01:03:55.743]  The Chinese government gets to destroy dissent.
[01:03:55.743 --> 01:03:59.244]  It's not just bio-warfare or media warfare, it's bio-media warfare.
[01:03:59.244 --> 01:04:04.945]  They're using viruses combined, biology combined with media to really control dissent.
[01:04:04.945 --> 01:04:11.686]  At the present moment, we have 43 domestic cases of the coronavirus.
[01:04:11.686 --> 01:04:15.027]  48 cases of individuals who have returned to the United States.
[01:04:16.367 --> 01:04:23.232]  Of the domestic cases, 29 of the 43 are either in California or Washington State.
[01:04:23.232 --> 01:04:31.879]  And we have communities that are facing what the experts tell us could potentially be a cluster.
[01:04:31.879 --> 01:04:45.089]  I'm a patriot through and through, and so I'm not going to have some foreign-born, grifting, fake conservative, fake patriot, Sebastian Gorka, tell me I'm a kook and I'm a loon.
[01:04:45.746 --> 01:04:48.127]  I'M AN AMERICAN BITCH!
[01:04:48.127 --> 01:04:49.348]  I'M AN AMERICAN BITCH!
[01:04:57.401 --> 01:05:00.004]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[01:05:00.004 --> 01:05:06.971]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[01:05:06.971 --> 01:05:17.442]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[01:05:17.842 --> 01:05:24.126]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[01:05:24.126 --> 01:05:25.107]  It is back in stock.
[01:05:25.107 --> 01:05:34.333]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:41.777]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[01:05:41.777 --> 01:05:42.258]  And of course,
[01:05:43.098 --> 01:05:49.840]  Vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:55.902]  And they're both back in stock 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at infowarstore.com.
[01:06:14.244 --> 01:06:26.571]  Well, we have a jam-packed transmission here on this Tuesday, March 3rd, 2020 system.
[01:06:26.571 --> 01:06:38.958]  Tommy Robinson sent me, during the middle of the show yesterday, just horrific videos and photos that we can't air here because of some of the things that happened on them, but
[01:06:40.148 --> 01:07:03.879]  When you understand the industrial scale of the Islamic Jihad in Europe and where, I mean, I have a stack of news today with courts ruling in Finland and Sweden that Muslims are allowed to rape children because it's their culture.
[01:07:07.179 --> 01:07:27.466]  Now imagine what it's like 12, 13 years, whatever it is later, for Tommy Robinson, a hero of free speech and of nationalism and of Christianity and of just basic goodness, to own a tanning salon and some businesses in the small town he was in, and to see Muslims running a kebab shop with kidnapped 9, 10-year-old girls, putting them in cars,
[01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:30.991]  Dozens of men having sex with him.
[01:07:30.991 --> 01:07:32.633]  The little girl's crying.
[01:07:32.633 --> 01:07:34.094]  He starts calling the police.
[01:07:34.094 --> 01:07:35.435]  Nothing's done.
[01:07:35.435 --> 01:07:36.937]  Muslims come over and start fights with him.
[01:07:36.937 --> 01:07:39.839]  He beats their ass.
[01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:41.261]  He's not a guy talking crap.
[01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:43.343]  He's seen anti-fund Muslims attack him.
[01:07:43.343 --> 01:07:45.225]  And he's not a big guy, but he's a lion.
[01:07:45.225 --> 01:07:46.486]  He fights back.
[01:07:46.486 --> 01:07:48.748]  He fights.
[01:07:48.748 --> 01:07:49.789]  And that's why they're scared of him.
[01:07:51.724 --> 01:07:54.925]  I'm not going to show all those videos today, but imagine the worst thing.
[01:07:54.925 --> 01:07:57.907]  Because I've done Skype with him.
[01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.167]  I've talked to him behind the scenes.
[01:07:59.167 --> 01:08:01.849]  I've seen his little sweet kids.
[01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:05.250]  Little, sweet, beautiful children.
[01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:07.171]  And I've got three daughters.
[01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:08.592]  One of them's two and a half, almost three.
[01:08:08.592 --> 01:08:09.652]  The other's now 12.
[01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:12.073]  The other's 15.
[01:08:12.073 --> 01:08:17.336]  And... Tommy's a lion.
[01:08:17.336 --> 01:08:18.096]  But I gotta tell ya...
[01:08:21.909 --> 01:08:25.211]  I'd be killing people.
[01:08:25.211 --> 01:08:26.752]  His daughter got sexually assaulted.
[01:08:26.752 --> 01:08:27.632]  But it's standard.
[01:08:27.632 --> 01:08:40.159]  You read about how kids can't get in pools now in England or Germany, because the Muslims, man, if a girl ain't wearing a full-on burkini, they're raped.
[01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:41.860]  They're fair game.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:43.081]  So there's your headline.
[01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:46.083]  Tommy Robinson's daughter sexually assaulted.
[01:08:46.083 --> 01:08:49.685]  He was arrested, but they realized they couldn't make that dog hunt, so they had to release him.
[01:08:50.745 --> 01:08:55.309]  And then I've got articles here, in fact I meant to have it, here it is right here, document camera shot please.
[01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:58.732]  I see this crap every day.
[01:08:58.732 --> 01:09:03.556]  Chicago's sanctuary policies responsible for rape of three-year-old girl.
[01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:14.026]  He grabbed the girl, takes her in the bathroom, the dad's trying to break in, starts raping her, admits on the stand he was raping her.
[01:09:14.026 --> 01:09:15.047]  The left says let him go.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.261]  That's on InfoWars.com with direct links.
[01:09:19.261 --> 01:09:23.083]  34-year-old Christopher Puente.
[01:09:23.083 --> 01:09:25.404]  How about Punta?
[01:09:25.404 --> 01:09:26.724]  And it says allegedly, but then it goes on.
[01:09:26.724 --> 01:09:28.725]  He admitted on the stand that, oh, I was wrong when I did.
[01:09:28.725 --> 01:09:30.426]  I couldn't help myself.
[01:09:30.426 --> 01:09:33.847]  Raping the three-year-old.
[01:09:33.847 --> 01:09:38.890]  The dad goes to take the son to the bathroom, who's also little.
[01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:42.611]  This guy grabs the daughter, runs in another bathroom, begins raping.
[01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:44.652]  He hears the daughter screaming, Daddy, help me!
[01:09:44.652 --> 01:09:45.272]  Daddy, help me!
[01:09:45.272 --> 01:09:46.173]  Goes in and fights back.
[01:09:48.348 --> 01:09:52.031]  It's a total pedophile takeover.
[01:09:52.031 --> 01:10:01.819]  And then you got the Muslims putting little kids in fires with smoke, making them cry, so they can run through as human shields invading Greece, with Erdogan openly announcing it.
[01:10:01.819 --> 01:10:09.025]  If Hitler would have just had some crying kids, the whole world would have just stood down to him.
[01:10:09.025 --> 01:10:13.589]  So, Tommy, it's incredible.
[01:10:15.179 --> 01:10:17.039]  What was it, 12, 13 years ago, whatever it was, correct?
[01:10:17.039 --> 01:10:19.320]  You've been in jail three or four times now, months.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.600]  Starve you in prison.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.801]  They put you in the Muslim block so they can attack you.
[01:10:23.801 --> 01:10:25.101]  They let them throw bleach on you.
[01:10:25.101 --> 01:10:26.322]  I mean, it's beyond a movie.
[01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:30.062]  If they made a movie of what happened, people would be like, what, every five minutes there's an attack?
[01:10:30.062 --> 01:10:31.403]  You're just running a tanning salon?
[01:10:31.403 --> 01:10:32.383]  They're like raping kids?
[01:10:32.383 --> 01:10:33.463]  You go call the police?
[01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:35.664]  The police, the Muslims come, you beat their ass?
[01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:36.284]  You get arrested?
[01:10:38.806 --> 01:10:42.889]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm tougher than you, man, but it wouldn't be beating ass with me, dude.
[01:10:42.889 --> 01:10:45.431]  Three or four Muslim dudes come in there and try to attack me, they're gonna die.
[01:10:45.431 --> 01:10:49.595]  And I just, and the way you've been persecuted, brother, is incredible.
[01:10:49.595 --> 01:10:54.699]  So you're here with us, and I just, I set all this up because I don't have words for this.
[01:10:54.699 --> 01:10:55.960]  Tell people what just happened.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.583]  You can't even go on vacation to a hotel pool now.
[01:10:59.583 --> 01:11:01.704]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:06.922]  It's a holiday resort called Centre Parks.
[01:11:06.922 --> 01:11:10.144]  My friend was staying there so you can get a guest pass.
[01:11:10.144 --> 01:11:17.871]  It's only 30 minutes from where I live, so my friend got... I brought me, my three children, and I let them bring a friend each.
[01:11:17.871 --> 01:11:20.132]  We went to the swimming pool.
[01:11:20.132 --> 01:11:21.654]  I was sat with my wife.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.121]  We're good to go.
[01:11:38.617 --> 01:11:39.757]  She's 8 years old.
[01:11:39.757 --> 01:11:40.678]  So she's 8 years old.
[01:11:40.678 --> 01:11:43.940]  So I questioned her to say, could it have been by accident?
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.661]  Has he brushed past you?
[01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:46.761]  Explain what's happened.
[01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:50.644]  And I took her through to show me and talk to me specifically what happened.
[01:11:50.644 --> 01:11:51.824]  She said, no, Daddy.
[01:11:51.824 --> 01:11:53.025]  He grabbed.
[01:11:53.025 --> 01:11:55.886]  He grabbed hold of my bum doing a fist like this.
[01:11:55.886 --> 01:11:58.248]  If that is your said drag queen story time, it'd be OK.
[01:11:58.248 --> 01:11:59.769]  This is all pedophile training.
[01:11:59.769 --> 01:12:00.329]  But please continue.
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.821]  So I've then walked over with my daughter.
[01:12:03.821 --> 01:12:05.382]  I've told the rest of my children to stay there.
[01:12:05.382 --> 01:12:07.403]  I said, come and show me who the man is.
[01:12:07.403 --> 01:12:08.743]  She's walked me over.
[01:12:08.743 --> 01:12:10.144]  She said, him, Daddy.
[01:12:10.144 --> 01:12:11.165]  She pointed at a man.
[01:12:11.165 --> 01:12:13.025]  It was an Asian male.
[01:12:13.025 --> 01:12:14.746]  To be honest, I doubt it.
[01:12:14.746 --> 01:12:16.367]  I don't think he is... They always call him Asian.
[01:12:16.367 --> 01:12:18.948]  It means Muslim?
[01:12:18.948 --> 01:12:20.749]  I don't think he'd be... I don't know.
[01:12:20.749 --> 01:12:23.610]  He looked Indian, so I don't know.
[01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:24.891]  But she pointed him out.
[01:12:25.692 --> 01:12:28.033]  I then said to her, go back over there now.
[01:12:28.033 --> 01:12:29.493]  I've looked at him.
[01:12:29.493 --> 01:12:31.353]  He's with another male.
[01:12:31.353 --> 01:12:36.115]  There's two of them, but he's standing specifically with another male who's wearing a pink cap.
[01:12:36.115 --> 01:12:37.655]  And I went over.
[01:12:37.655 --> 01:12:40.916]  I said, all right, lads, who are you with here?
[01:12:40.916 --> 01:12:44.437]  Have you got children with you?
[01:12:44.437 --> 01:12:45.097]  And they said, no.
[01:12:45.097 --> 01:12:47.797]  I said, any women with you?
[01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:48.998]  No.
[01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:51.358]  So this is a children's holiday resort.
[01:12:51.358 --> 01:12:53.379]  It's where you take your kids.
[01:12:53.379 --> 01:12:54.499]  It's a kid's swimming pool.
[01:12:55.011 --> 01:13:06.919]  And here we have two middle-aged men, and then instantly I'm, okay, so you've got two, you've got a couple of middle-aged men, three middle-aged men, and then I said, um, something's just happened with my daughter.
[01:13:06.919 --> 01:13:08.360]  What's just happened with my daughter?
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.201]  And straight away I could tell by his reaction.
[01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:14.764]  So I went over not knowing, but instantly I knew by his reaction.
[01:13:14.764 --> 01:13:16.965]  And he said, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:13:16.965 --> 01:13:18.326]  I grabbed her bum by mistake.
[01:13:18.326 --> 01:13:19.527]  I pinched her bum by mistake.
[01:13:20.959 --> 01:13:24.721]  And at that point, then, he's gone to go to my right.
[01:13:24.721 --> 01:13:26.161]  I've stood in his way.
[01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:27.622]  He's gone to dart, basically.
[01:13:27.622 --> 01:13:28.462]  I've stood in his way.
[01:13:28.462 --> 01:13:30.783]  At that point, we've tussled.
[01:13:30.783 --> 01:13:32.944]  My hands are swinging.
[01:13:32.944 --> 01:13:35.625]  Oh, brother, I'd have slammed his head in the concrete.
[01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:37.346]  Good job taking that piece of crap on.
[01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:40.187]  I mean, it's time to stop putting up with this crap.
[01:13:40.187 --> 01:13:47.010]  They're trying to test us all and train us that big, fat men can come into school and molest our children, and it's time it stopped.
[01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.871]  So I commend you for smacking that piece of trash upside the head.
[01:13:51.421 --> 01:13:55.203]  Someone pressed the buzzer press, all the lifeguards come.
[01:13:55.203 --> 01:14:01.105]  At that point then, my children were hysterical anyway, but at that point then, the lifeguards have come.
[01:14:01.105 --> 01:14:02.286]  I said, you need to get the police.
[01:14:02.286 --> 01:14:05.787]  He sexually assaulted my daughter.
[01:14:05.787 --> 01:14:07.328]  They've then took him away.
[01:14:07.328 --> 01:14:12.550]  I've then sat with my children for about three hours, speaking to the manager of the hotel.
[01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.491]  The manager of the hotel has come up and said, all the police are here.
[01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:15.711]  They've got him.
[01:14:15.711 --> 01:14:17.052]  They need to speak to your daughter.
[01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:18.553]  My daughter sat down.
[01:14:18.553 --> 01:14:19.433]  She sat down with my wife.
[01:14:20.242 --> 01:14:20.862]  We're good to go.
[01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:55.968]  Now, to be honest, I was expecting, okay, there's been an altercation, he's got a bloody nose, I'll go downstairs, and they've gone over and arrested him, but they probably need to speak to me now about what's happened, about how I detained him.
[01:14:55.968 --> 01:14:58.469]  So I've gone downstairs, and then they've said they're arresting me.
[01:14:59.359 --> 01:15:03.441]  At which point, they said they're arresting me to prevent further injury, they said.
[01:15:03.441 --> 01:15:04.821]  And I said, prevent further injury?
[01:15:04.821 --> 01:15:08.022]  I've sat here for three hours waiting for you.
[01:15:08.022 --> 01:15:13.624]  No, your crime was calling them for the sex assault and touching a member of the Supreme Force.
[01:15:13.624 --> 01:15:15.405]  Who they believe may be a Muslim.
[01:15:15.405 --> 01:15:16.865]  You touched a God.
[01:15:16.865 --> 01:15:19.666]  Your daughter is nothing but meat for him to enjoy.
[01:15:19.666 --> 01:15:25.308]  Well, they acted... The victim in this, according to them, is the male that's grabbed my daughter's bum.
[01:15:25.308 --> 01:15:26.549]  Sir, the God.
[01:15:27.813 --> 01:15:28.573]  Yeah.
[01:15:28.573 --> 01:15:31.675]  And then they told me that they've not arrested him.
[01:15:31.675 --> 01:15:32.976]  And I couldn't believe it!
[01:15:32.976 --> 01:15:36.578]  Finland just ruled women can be raped.
[01:15:36.578 --> 01:15:41.861]  In Cologne, Germany, they told women, wear a bracelet saying don't rape and don't wear short skirts.
[01:15:41.861 --> 01:15:43.041]  That's the left.
[01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:48.244]  Tell women don't wear short skirts because Islam and the East is God!
[01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:50.385]  The West must fall!
[01:15:50.385 --> 01:15:52.466]  Your children are ours!
[01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:52.606]  Yes!

[01:16:37.788 --> 01:16:38.989]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners.
[01:16:38.989 --> 01:16:40.609]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[01:16:40.609 --> 01:16:43.171]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:59.062]  I'm here with Scott Youseum, founder of OMG Tax.
[01:16:59.062 --> 01:17:03.926]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[01:17:03.926 --> 01:17:10.330]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:15.714]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[01:17:15.794 --> 01:17:18.235]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[01:17:18.235 --> 01:17:19.655]  Oh, can I ever?
[01:17:19.655 --> 01:17:24.816]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[01:17:24.816 --> 01:17:25.597]  Guess what?
[01:17:25.597 --> 01:17:30.638]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[01:17:30.638 --> 01:17:40.901]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:41.781]  That's 800-486-8112.
[01:17:57.330 --> 01:18:02.854]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[01:18:02.854 --> 01:18:06.277]  Now, can somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[01:18:06.277 --> 01:18:06.857]  Yeah.
[01:18:06.857 --> 01:18:09.419]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man, I love women.
[01:18:09.419 --> 01:18:11.040]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.401]  You may have problems with her.
[01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:13.682]  You may get a divorce.
[01:18:13.682 --> 01:18:14.302]  You may whatever.
[01:18:14.302 --> 01:18:19.066]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful and I loved.

[01:18:56.835 --> 01:19:05.019]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness, and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[01:19:05.019 --> 01:19:05.599]  That's good.
[01:19:05.599 --> 01:19:07.980]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:14.964]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[01:19:14.964 --> 01:19:18.645]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[01:19:18.645 --> 01:19:25.609]  And that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:31.433]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.

[01:19:59.941 --> 01:20:02.590]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:36.345 --> 01:20:39.186]  Infowars.com, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:20:39.186 --> 01:20:40.326]  Now, I have the data.
[01:20:40.326 --> 01:20:42.307]  I have the statistics.
[01:20:42.307 --> 01:20:43.167]  You've all seen it.
[01:21:00.313 --> 01:21:03.514]  Rapes are up thousands of percentiles across Europe.
[01:21:03.514 --> 01:21:08.056]  80 plus percent are Muslim men.
[01:21:08.056 --> 01:21:11.958]  For some reason, Pakistani men is the largest group.
[01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:13.659]  But there are others involved.
[01:21:13.659 --> 01:21:22.183]  And if you go to a lot of Eastern cultures, let's say Central Asian cultures, not the Japan or places you'd be killed if you grabbed somebody's kid.
[01:21:22.183 --> 01:21:23.263]  No one would do it.
[01:21:23.263 --> 01:21:23.743]  They'd kill you.
[01:21:23.743 --> 01:21:24.784]  The police would kill you.
[01:21:24.784 --> 01:21:25.424]  It wouldn't be in the news.
[01:21:25.424 --> 01:21:26.304]  They'd just kill you right there.
[01:21:26.304 --> 01:21:27.485]  You wouldn't ever make it to the police station.
[01:21:28.553 --> 01:21:33.277]  But, so it's not Asia, it's that area of Central Asia in the Middle East.
[01:21:33.277 --> 01:21:38.802]  Targets girls because these men can't get a woman.
[01:21:38.802 --> 01:21:45.908]  And there's a real shortage of quote women because it's such a controlled commodity in the Middle East because women are slaves and people that have them hoard them.
[01:21:45.908 --> 01:21:51.953]  So the left worships Islam and worships the East, brings it in and tries to get us to adopt it.
[01:21:51.953 --> 01:21:54.575]  And Tommy Robbins has been trying to keep his head down.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.881]  He's trying to take care of his family.
[01:21:56.881 --> 01:22:00.784]  He's been a political prisoner a couple times the last two years.
[01:22:00.784 --> 01:22:05.087]  He lost, you know, 40-something pounds like a concentration camp victim when he first came out.
[01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.287]  It was on Tucker Carlson.
[01:22:06.287 --> 01:22:07.548]  It was on our show like a week later.
[01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:09.690]  And he's come back now.
[01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:18.396]  But I mean, you know, we're talking in the Muslim ward, in solitary confinement, where they would come and put their butts up to the crack in the cell and piss and crap on him.
[01:22:18.396 --> 01:22:19.457]  This is what they do.
[01:22:20.216 --> 01:22:22.016]  Trying to demoralize him.
[01:22:22.016 --> 01:22:23.077]  They were poisoning his food.
[01:22:23.077 --> 01:22:23.717]  He couldn't eat the food.
[01:22:23.717 --> 01:22:24.637]  That's why he lost all the weight.
[01:22:24.637 --> 01:22:27.678]  He would only eat the little tuna fish he got daily and crackers that were sealed.
[01:22:27.678 --> 01:22:29.098]  Because they were poisoning his food.
[01:22:29.098 --> 01:22:32.399]  Because Muslims run the prison now.
[01:22:32.399 --> 01:22:33.559]  Because they're tyrants.
[01:22:33.559 --> 01:22:34.659]  And they're bullies.
[01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:36.920]  And I won't stand for it anymore.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:42.061]  So, your daughter, Tommy Robinson's daughter has been sexually assaulted.
[01:22:42.061 --> 01:22:45.382]  Tommy Robinson arrested for reporting the sexual assault of his daughter.
[01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:48.823]  Isn't that his karma?
[01:22:48.823 --> 01:22:49.143]  Because...
[01:22:50.796 --> 01:22:53.618]  13 years ago, or you'll correct me, 12 years ago, 15 years ago.
[01:22:53.618 --> 01:22:56.140]  Tell us, Tommy, when you first got arrested, you're famous.
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:58.241]  You said there's Muslim grooming gangs.
[01:22:58.241 --> 01:22:58.862]  They won't call that.
[01:22:58.862 --> 01:23:00.083]  They call them Asian.
[01:23:00.083 --> 01:23:01.303]  And you caught them doing it.
[01:23:01.303 --> 01:23:05.266]  Then it came out they were killing kids and cutting them up and putting them into kebab machines.
[01:23:05.266 --> 01:23:06.727]  That's mainstream news.
[01:23:06.727 --> 01:23:07.928]  Tommy said that like five years ago.
[01:23:07.928 --> 01:23:08.368]  I looked it up.
[01:23:08.368 --> 01:23:12.471]  I was like, oh, the guy was convicted of cooking kids in a kebab machine.
[01:23:12.471 --> 01:23:14.892]  I mean, you're watching this as a salon owner.
[01:23:14.892 --> 01:23:16.734]  You're not very old now.
[01:23:16.734 --> 01:23:19.736]  What was it like for you to just be watching children's sex traffic?
[01:23:21.337 --> 01:23:22.798]  I mean, you're not a hero.
[01:23:22.798 --> 01:23:23.398]  I'm not a hero.
[01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:24.379]  You're the normal man.
[01:23:24.379 --> 01:23:32.064]  You stood up for little kids, and now your own daughter's been assaulted, and you're the criminal.
[01:23:32.064 --> 01:23:38.168]  With regards to what's happened with my daughter, do you know what makes me feel sick is I've watched the response today.
[01:23:38.168 --> 01:23:48.756]  All the people who would be part of the Me Too movement, who would be demanding that we take... Do you know, as a young girl, as an eight-year-old child, as children, as victims who have been sexually assaulted,
[01:23:49.418 --> 01:23:51.119]  She done everything right.
[01:23:51.119 --> 01:23:52.500]  She comes straight up to us.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:59.665]  She told us, I'm already thinking how many other children did that man touch that weekend in that swimming pool that didn't go and tell their mums and dads.
[01:23:59.665 --> 01:24:04.588]  Now we tell people, so my daughter comes up and she tells me, she tells us what's happened.
[01:24:04.588 --> 01:24:06.790]  We restrain him, he's arrested.
[01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:12.473]  Then my worry now, my daughter come home from school today, the teachers rang up, she come home at lunchtime, yeah?
[01:24:12.473 --> 01:24:14.274]  She wasn't feeling very well.
[01:24:14.274 --> 01:24:17.957]  Now she started, as soon as they said the police were coming,
[01:24:18.667 --> 01:24:20.729]  She got so emotional, yeah?
[01:24:20.729 --> 01:24:25.332]  Because she has a view of the police because of what's gone on with me.
[01:24:25.332 --> 01:24:28.675]  Then the police turn up and they concrete that view.
[01:24:28.675 --> 01:24:31.216]  Because then her dad doesn't come back.
[01:24:31.216 --> 01:24:34.999]  And then she sits there all night crying, upset with my other children.
[01:24:34.999 --> 01:24:36.640]  Let's say it again, let's be clear.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.623]  She goes to her daddy when a man grabs her ass.
[01:24:40.925 --> 01:24:50.227]  And she goes to her, the man, genetically protect her, you go and stand up to that piece of trash, and the police came and took you, she now sees them as Darth Vader.
[01:24:50.227 --> 01:25:02.330]  The police come and took me, and although she's eight, so she's not following everything on social media, but my other two children are, they've gone to school today, everyone's talking about it, they all know that I'm being prosecuted, I face six months in prison.
[01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:05.910]  What message have they sent to my daughter?
[01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:08.811]  That's what's pissing me off, it really is winding me up, it's winding me up!
[01:25:09.577 --> 01:25:14.419]  It's winding me up that she's coming home from school, she's probably worried, she's probably upset, she's done everything right.
[01:25:14.419 --> 01:25:26.905]  And all of the newspapers, what they've done today, every national newspaper in my country, Sky News, BBC News, the videos there, on that video that's playing now, my daughter sits and gives a statement and says what that man done.
[01:25:26.905 --> 01:25:35.249]  It's not me saying it, it's not political Tommy Robinson talking about it, it's an eight-year-old child giving an account of a man sexually assaulting her.
[01:25:35.769 --> 01:25:47.983]  And they're coming out today, I've seen the Times journalist, another, another, what was his name, Mike Graham, another man from Talk Radio, have come out and they're calling my daughter a liar!
[01:25:48.996 --> 01:25:52.477]  These are the people who would be saying we must listen to victims.
[01:25:52.477 --> 01:25:55.018]  By the way, we're going to play her statement coming up.
[01:25:55.018 --> 01:25:57.779]  I forgot you sent it to me and I've got a problem.
[01:25:57.779 --> 01:26:01.480]  When I see something this horrible, I have trouble seeing it again or even playing it.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.521]  So I'm not covering stuff up.
[01:26:03.521 --> 01:26:08.023]  It's like we're going to air her video statement on what happened to her.
[01:26:08.023 --> 01:26:11.724]  And I saw the news this morning calling your little darling.
[01:26:11.724 --> 01:26:12.304]  People can see her.
[01:26:12.304 --> 01:26:13.245]  I've seen her.
[01:26:13.245 --> 01:26:13.985]  Such a sweetheart.
[01:26:16.499 --> 01:26:17.420]  None in the mainstream.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.220]  None of them.
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.401]  They've all run a headline saying I've assaulted someone at a holiday park.
[01:26:21.401 --> 01:26:22.882]  None of them have mentioned.
[01:26:22.882 --> 01:26:23.802]  I mean, none of them.
[01:26:23.802 --> 01:26:26.063]  Go and look at BBC News article on this case.
[01:26:26.063 --> 01:26:27.844]  Go look at Sky News article on this case.
[01:26:27.844 --> 01:26:30.405]  They just say I've assaulted someone at a family holiday park.
[01:26:30.405 --> 01:26:35.366]  None of them mention the fact there was a sexual assault against my child, which isn't me confirming it.
[01:26:35.366 --> 01:26:37.947]  The police on that video you've got confirm it.
[01:26:37.947 --> 01:26:39.408]  My daughter confirms it.
[01:26:39.828 --> 01:26:41.049]  It's all confirmed.
[01:26:41.049 --> 01:26:51.134]  None of these news articles, and what they've done, when you see the power of the media, I mean like every little newspaper in my country has flown this story out across my entire country.
[01:26:51.134 --> 01:26:59.338]  I'm lucky that even though I'm banned from social media, that video that you've been playing has gone so far, I've added it up to over 4.5 million people in the UK.
[01:26:59.338 --> 01:27:02.539]  And by the way, 4.5 million people have seen that one, and I've got the video sent me to your daughter.
[01:27:02.539 --> 01:27:08.022]  What's the best place for people to find the video while it's still up of your daughter's statement about the sexual assault?
[01:27:08.953 --> 01:27:10.573]  Well, go to TR.news.
[01:27:10.573 --> 01:27:11.694]  Go to the website.
[01:27:11.694 --> 01:27:12.874]  TR.news.
[01:27:12.874 --> 01:27:14.854]  You'll see it on the article.
[01:27:14.854 --> 01:27:16.815]  And that's his daughter.
[01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:18.475]  We'll play it when we come back.
[01:27:18.475 --> 01:27:19.315]  But let's be clear.
[01:27:19.315 --> 01:27:21.456]  I don't know what the bigger scandal here is.
[01:27:21.456 --> 01:27:24.056]  That they allow the sexual assaults to continue in MASH.
[01:27:24.056 --> 01:27:30.738]  Or that the media and the police work in unison to suppress the man that literally first exposed.
[01:27:30.738 --> 01:27:35.459]  How many years ago was it, because you're on record, first exposing the Muslim grooming rape gangs?
[01:27:36.263 --> 01:27:42.205]  I've just done a presentation last week in Russia, where I show documentation and newspapers from 2004.
[01:27:42.205 --> 01:27:45.427]  Oh, you show them a giant super stadium.
[01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:47.788]  I mean, Russia cares about this.
[01:27:47.788 --> 01:27:50.509]  From 2004, so what's that?
[01:27:50.509 --> 01:27:50.769]  16 years?
[01:27:50.769 --> 01:27:51.369]  15 years?
[01:27:51.369 --> 01:27:52.990]  Okay, so I'm saying 13.
[01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:53.710]  I'm always behind.
[01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:55.391]  So for 16 years.
[01:27:55.391 --> 01:27:56.752]  Let's talk about you for a minute.
[01:27:56.752 --> 01:27:58.552]  I want to come back and talk about you.
[01:27:58.552 --> 01:28:02.354]  When we come back, what was it like, Tommy, when you first saw him trafficking little kids?
[01:28:03.848 --> 01:28:06.569]  Well, first it happened to my cousin.
[01:28:06.569 --> 01:28:07.569]  So it happened to our cousin.
[01:28:07.569 --> 01:28:10.329]  And it was no one dealing with it.
[01:28:10.329 --> 01:28:10.930]  And do you know what?
[01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:17.771]  We had a different view even as children, because many of the girls in our school were getting picked up by older Pakistani Muslim men.
[01:28:17.771 --> 01:28:23.532]  But a lot of the kids in school just viewed the girls as slags in school, as children.
[01:28:23.532 --> 01:28:27.033]  As you come out of school and you grow up, you think they're victims of these gangs.
[01:28:27.033 --> 01:28:31.294]  You had 12-year-old children being picked up by men having sex with them, being raped by them.
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:34.802]  And, uh, but yeah, it's, I know we're on Twitter.
[01:28:34.802 --> 01:28:44.628]  But when we get back, when we come back after the break, I'll give you the true statistics on these crimes, which I just prepared, and I thought I know all of this scandal.
[01:28:44.628 --> 01:28:46.189]  I went through victim statements.
[01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.989]  It's worse than you thought.
[01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:47.730]  Stay there.
[01:28:47.730 --> 01:28:50.391]  And again, Tommy Robinson fights back.
[01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:51.532]  That's what he does.
[01:28:51.532 --> 01:28:54.834]  Somebody assaults his daughter, he stands up to them and knocks them down.
[01:28:56.397 --> 01:29:01.460]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:29:59.046 --> 01:30:01.847]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble.
[01:30:01.847 --> 01:30:04.309]  This is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[01:30:04.309 --> 01:30:08.872]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food.
[01:30:08.872 --> 01:30:14.216]  And I had long discussions this morning, over an hour-long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this.
[01:30:14.216 --> 01:30:17.898]  Right now, the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have, but they want me to
[01:30:18.018 --> 01:30:18.598]  I don't know.
[01:30:41.988 --> 01:30:43.369]  I always promote DNA Force Plus.

[01:31:56.473 --> 01:32:02.297]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[01:32:02.297 --> 01:32:05.840]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.162]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[01:32:08.162 --> 01:32:09.983]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:11.585]  So here I am telling people.
[01:32:12.325 --> 01:32:22.472]  Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[01:32:22.472 --> 01:32:34.020]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.381]  It feels so good.
[01:32:36.381 --> 01:32:39.463]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[01:32:39.463 --> 01:32:41.745]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[01:32:42.485 --> 01:32:45.628]  Three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[01:32:45.628 --> 01:32:59.841]  Because I like the way it feels.
[01:32:59.841 --> 01:33:02.484]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.205 --> 01:33:22.051]  It's time to decide who you are.
[01:33:35.455 --> 01:33:51.064]  It's time to decide whether you're going to surrender to the devil worshippers, the pedophiles, the communists, the socialists, the Hollywood trash, the people that tell you how bad you are all day unless you do exactly what they say.
[01:33:51.064 --> 01:33:57.228]  They're psychological terrorists.
[01:33:57.228 --> 01:34:01.490]  They are molesting your psyche.
[01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:02.411]  It's time to stop.
[01:34:04.286 --> 01:34:08.969]  Giving them hospitality and humanizing them.
[01:34:08.969 --> 01:34:19.456]  When the Islamists invade Greece and put children over fires and make the children cry, when they run through police, they're terrorists for using children as human shields!
[01:34:19.456 --> 01:34:23.419]  And the corporate media that goes along with that are even worse.
[01:34:23.419 --> 01:34:33.766]  They have all the footage of them, Westerners, directing them to torture the children before they ram through the police in their military operations.
[01:34:36.094 --> 01:34:43.200]  Tommy Robinson is here.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.843]  I'm going to play a minute and 50 second clip of his daughter.
[01:34:45.843 --> 01:34:47.584]  He can say her first name if he'd like.
[01:34:47.584 --> 01:34:48.485]  She's out there now.
[01:34:48.485 --> 01:34:51.667]  And I have the articles here.
[01:34:51.667 --> 01:34:53.849]  Chicago knew this guy was a criminal.
[01:34:53.849 --> 01:34:55.831]  They'd attacked people who committed crimes.
[01:34:55.831 --> 01:34:57.252]  They didn't let ICE pick him up.
[01:34:57.252 --> 01:34:58.473]  And now he raped a three-year-old.
[01:34:58.473 --> 01:35:00.135]  He's confessed to it.
[01:35:00.135 --> 01:35:03.898]  While the dad took the little boy to the bathroom, he grabs her and takes her to the bathroom and starts raping her.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.841]  And he said, I'm sorry, it's wrong what I did.
[01:35:08.841 --> 01:35:11.482]  The left says, release him.
[01:35:11.482 --> 01:35:13.223]  Give us Barabbas.
[01:35:13.223 --> 01:35:14.824]  Finland says, we're ending rape.
[01:35:14.824 --> 01:35:17.725]  Just submit to it.
[01:35:17.725 --> 01:35:21.466]  It is a total cuck event.
[01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:22.467]  So, Tommy.
[01:35:23.618 --> 01:35:30.565]  I want to play this clip of your daughter that the mainstream media, we put the articles up on screen for TV viewers, are actually calling your 8-year-old daughter a liar.
[01:35:30.565 --> 01:35:35.490]  I mean, Chris Matthews told a guest, you're very beautiful, he's had to resign.
[01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:43.397]  Drag Queen Storytime, they'll have men with children riding horsey on them, with the parents getting off on the obvious pedophilic behavior.
[01:35:43.397 --> 01:35:44.979]  I mean, this is open pedophilia.
[01:35:49.552 --> 01:35:53.115]  And those of us that aren't into this, we're blind to it because it's just so alien.
[01:35:53.115 --> 01:35:56.118]  It's like, what the hell is this?
[01:35:56.118 --> 01:35:57.259]  You've got the floor.
[01:35:57.259 --> 01:35:58.600]  I can talk and ask questions all day.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.121]  Whenever you're ready, throw to the clip of your daughter.
[01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:02.784]  Go ahead.
[01:36:02.784 --> 01:36:04.025]  You got the clip there?
[01:36:04.025 --> 01:36:04.505]  We've got it.
[01:36:04.505 --> 01:36:06.227]  I'm just, I'm asking questions here.
[01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:09.389]  I could talk for hours about this, but what else do you want to tell people?
[01:36:09.389 --> 01:36:10.670]  You want to play the clip?
[01:36:10.670 --> 01:36:11.251]  You just... Yeah.
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:19.845]  My thing is that none of the media, they've all run a story, they've not mentioned that my daughter was assaulted, sexually assaulted.
[01:36:19.845 --> 01:36:21.086]  They've completely left it out.
[01:36:21.086 --> 01:36:22.166]  It's not in the headlines.
[01:36:22.166 --> 01:36:26.049]  It's Tommy Robinson arrested for assaulting someone in a pool.
[01:36:26.049 --> 01:36:28.030]  It's not even in the story.
[01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:30.612]  In 90% of them, it's not even in the story.
[01:36:30.612 --> 01:36:32.213]  It's not even in there at all.
[01:36:32.213 --> 01:36:39.157]  No, no, type in Tommy Robinson, click Google, and it's all Tommy Robinson assaults innocent, loving person in a pool.
[01:36:41.376 --> 01:36:47.019]  And this has been pushed around the whole country, where the reality is, I was restrained.
[01:36:47.019 --> 01:36:51.782]  And I said in my police interview, if I wanted to, I could have kicked that man all around that swimming pool.
[01:36:51.782 --> 01:36:53.683]  He was trying to escape.
[01:36:53.683 --> 01:36:54.504]  You stopped him.
[01:36:55.438 --> 01:36:56.159]  That's it.
[01:36:56.159 --> 01:36:59.441]  I've done what I rightfully should have done.
[01:36:59.441 --> 01:37:00.862]  I haven't jumped all over him.
[01:37:00.862 --> 01:37:03.264]  I'm in court on common assault, not GBH.
[01:37:03.264 --> 01:37:05.206]  I've not battered the hell out of him.
[01:37:05.206 --> 01:37:06.567]  I've gripped him up.
[01:37:06.567 --> 01:37:08.088]  He's got a bleeding nose.
[01:37:08.088 --> 01:37:09.469]  And then the police have come.
[01:37:09.469 --> 01:37:13.052]  And then they've made a decision to arrest me and not arrest him.
[01:37:13.052 --> 01:37:13.812]  They haven't arrested him.
[01:37:13.812 --> 01:37:15.253]  He's not been arrested.
[01:37:15.253 --> 01:37:15.714]  What?
[01:37:15.714 --> 01:37:17.235]  He has not been arrested.
[01:37:17.235 --> 01:37:19.737]  My daughter, they left him with his mobile phone.
[01:37:19.737 --> 01:37:23.500]  Him and two other weird-looking men who are in Children's Swimming Pool.
[01:37:24.247 --> 01:37:28.709]  In Centre Parcs have been let go with their phones and none of them have been arrested.
[01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:30.170]  He hasn't been arrested.
[01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:31.530]  I've been arrested.
[01:37:31.530 --> 01:37:35.052]  And it's just... So that's terrible.
[01:37:35.052 --> 01:37:35.972]  That's sick.
[01:37:35.972 --> 01:37:37.693]  Let's start over.
[01:37:37.693 --> 01:37:46.076]  Tommy Robinson's daughter assaulted sexual assaulter who admitted to it not arrested and you've been arrested.
[01:37:46.076 --> 01:37:50.238]  I mean this is the inversion of reality because they want to complete their invasion.
[01:37:51.235 --> 01:37:54.757]  In the police interview, the copper says he's admitted grabbing her.
[01:37:54.757 --> 01:37:55.977]  He's admitted grabbing her.
[01:37:55.977 --> 01:37:59.999]  The copper says it in my... I've ordered my police interview, but he says it.
[01:37:59.999 --> 01:38:02.861]  He's admits grabbing her flesh.
[01:38:02.861 --> 01:38:04.802]  It's like, come on, man, what's going on?
[01:38:04.802 --> 01:38:07.003]  I've read today two comments.
[01:38:07.003 --> 01:38:14.326]  I've been following it, and two comments have been put up by people whose family work at Centre Parks, and they're both said similar.
[01:38:14.326 --> 01:38:17.708]  The reason he wasn't arrested is because he's got mental problems.
[01:38:17.708 --> 01:38:19.129]  That's what I've read.
[01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.649]  That's what I've read.
[01:38:20.402 --> 01:38:20.863]  I've read that.
[01:38:20.863 --> 01:38:21.985]  I don't know if it's true.
[01:38:21.985 --> 01:38:27.174]  Again, for that voice... Oh, he assaulted... He buried a little girl in the back yard.
[01:38:27.174 --> 01:38:28.255]  He's got problems.
[01:38:28.255 --> 01:38:30.038]  He's a Muslim, though, so he's God.
[01:38:30.038 --> 01:38:33.765]  He sexually assaulted my eight-year-old child.
[01:38:34.443 --> 01:38:50.658]  To know my daughter and to see, and even to see her, I picked her up from school today at 12 o'clock to see her coming out and to know that, for me, it's the knowing in her mind that she's thinking about it, that she's going to think about this, that she might feel she's done something wrong by telling her dad because he's been arrested.
[01:38:51.405 --> 01:38:55.988]  That's what upsets me more, because I think she's done everything right.
[01:38:55.988 --> 01:39:05.695]  And then not just with that, but I see some sick bastards going online and saying that my daughter would be lying or I've coached her what to fucking say.
[01:39:05.695 --> 01:39:09.477]  I'm out on a family day out with my children and their friends.
[01:39:09.477 --> 01:39:11.078]  They bought a friend each.
[01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:11.919]  We're in a swimming pool.
[01:39:12.697 --> 01:39:13.718]  On a day out!
[01:39:13.718 --> 01:39:20.522]  No, the truth is, the truth is, there is an existential envy of the West and they would never get away with this in their own countries.
[01:39:20.522 --> 01:39:22.283]  They're here to rape us.
[01:39:22.283 --> 01:39:32.349]  Just like the left is, just like the pedophile story hour, it's all about raping and having fun and having the media back the raping of the West because we haven't started fighting back yet.
[01:39:32.349 --> 01:39:35.270]  Do you know the numbers, Alex, yeah?
[01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:36.431]  I was just preparing.
[01:39:36.431 --> 01:39:37.752]  Oh yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:39:37.752 --> 01:39:39.313]  Give people the numbers.
[01:39:39.313 --> 01:39:41.134]  They don't want us to know about who's doing the raping.
[01:39:41.795 --> 01:39:42.515]  I was preparing.
[01:39:42.515 --> 01:39:44.396]  So I was looking at each town and city.
[01:39:44.396 --> 01:39:46.257]  So I was going through the demographics.
[01:39:46.257 --> 01:39:47.618]  I looked at Telford.
[01:39:47.618 --> 01:39:52.140]  Telford is a city where there's five dead bodies from these gangs, okay?
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:53.340]  Three burned to death.
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.841]  They set them on fire, burned them to death.
[01:39:54.841 --> 01:39:56.362]  Another one they killed with a car.
[01:39:56.362 --> 01:39:57.683]  Another one they killed with heroin.
[01:39:57.683 --> 01:40:00.044]  She was injected with heroin in an overdose.
[01:40:00.044 --> 01:40:00.764]  Five.
[01:40:00.764 --> 01:40:02.765]  Five people murdered in one town.
[01:40:02.765 --> 01:40:05.646]  The Muslim population of that town in Telford is 1.8%.
[01:40:07.687 --> 01:40:10.788]  That's like 3,600 Muslims in this town.
[01:40:10.788 --> 01:40:17.030]  When you cut out, when you half that to get rid of the women, you're left with like 1,800 Muslims, yeah?
[01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:25.092]  When you actually take off the under 16s and the over 65s, the figure you're left with is 956 Muslim men.
[01:40:25.092 --> 01:40:31.594]  So there's 956 Muslim men that fit the age criteria, in the age bracket, of the men that are involved in these gangs.
[01:40:31.594 --> 01:40:32.914]  Now in this one small town,
[01:40:33.334 --> 01:40:37.579]  The police identified 1,000 victims, yeah, in this small town.
[01:40:38.288 --> 01:40:47.390]  Then Operation Chalice is the police investigation has identified 200 Muslim men in that town involved in these rapes.
[01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:57.232]  That's 21% of the male Muslim population of one small town in England have been involved in the rape of children in that town.
[01:40:57.232 --> 01:41:01.133]  Now there's only two towns in the UK we have the figures for.
[01:41:01.133 --> 01:41:02.213]  Telford, 1.8% Muslim.
[01:41:03.593 --> 01:41:06.255]  And Rotherham, 3.7% Muslim.
[01:41:06.255 --> 01:41:08.676]  If you take the demographics of Rotherham, okay?
[01:41:08.676 --> 01:41:24.925]  When you take the demographics of Rotherham, it works out, there's only, I'll go through the figures, it works out that off of the statistics, because only 3.7% are Muslim, it leaves that there are 15%, in Rotherham it works out 15%.
[01:41:24.925 --> 01:41:28.567]  When you do the demographics and you get rid of the children, you get rid of the elders, it leaves 15%.
[01:41:28.567 --> 01:41:30.328]  15% of the Muslim population there,
[01:41:32.823 --> 01:41:36.186]  And 21% here, these are the only two towns we have figures for.
[01:41:36.186 --> 01:41:47.894]  Many other towns in the UK have tried to get investigations... And they're committing almost all the rape because the Imam of Jerusalem said three years ago on video, we are going to Europe to rape their women, to take them!
[01:41:49.492 --> 01:41:55.838]  In this presentation I just gave, I played videos from two Imams confirming what they're being taught.
[01:41:55.838 --> 01:42:09.151]  But the thing is, if you take that statistic, if you take 15% and you take 21%, say we meet in the middle at 17%, and you take 17% of the male Muslim population in our country, we're not nearly 3 or 4 million Muslims.
[01:42:09.691 --> 01:42:14.833]  You then get, with the only towns we've had the numbers for, Telford and Rotherham, 1.8% Muslim, 3.7%.
[01:42:14.833 --> 01:42:17.774]  What do you think it's like in Luton where it's 35%?
[01:42:17.774 --> 01:42:19.894]  What do you think it's like in Bradford where it's 40%?
[01:42:19.894 --> 01:42:22.095]  What do you think it's like in Birmingham?
[01:42:22.095 --> 01:42:23.476]  What do you think it's like in these towns?
[01:42:23.476 --> 01:42:25.676]  They control the police, you don't know.
[01:42:25.676 --> 01:42:27.797]  It's a total sex dungeon takeover.
[01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:33.253]  Oh, in this presentation I give, I show a family tree in Rotherham, okay?
[01:42:33.253 --> 01:42:35.874]  You've got the Muslim groomers, three brothers Muslim groomers.
[01:42:35.874 --> 01:42:40.237]  You've got the deputy leader of the council, Muslim groomer's cousin, who's involved in the rapes.
[01:42:40.237 --> 01:42:43.298]  His daughter works with a charity involved with the grooming victims.
[01:42:43.298 --> 01:42:46.080]  In the middle is a Muslim commentator for the BBC.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:46.980]  He's their cousin.
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:53.224]  On the other side, a police officer... It's a total pedophile cult, just like every other New World Order system.
[01:42:53.224 --> 01:42:55.025]  You have identified it, their mothership.
[01:42:55.862 --> 01:42:57.684]  We always promote being prepared.
[01:42:57.684 --> 01:43:01.307]  Having firearms, knowing how to use them, and be self-sufficient.
[01:43:01.307 --> 01:43:03.629]  And learn how to hunt, and learn how to garden.
[01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:05.191]  I mean, it's just, it's what we're meant to do.
[01:43:05.191 --> 01:43:06.412]  It feels good when we do it.
[01:43:06.412 --> 01:43:08.314]  But we do sell high quality, affordable food.
[01:43:08.314 --> 01:43:10.476]  I told my patriot a month ago, I said,
[01:43:10.776 --> 01:43:11.397]  What can you handle?
[01:43:11.397 --> 01:43:12.497]  I said, I think this is going to be really big.
[01:43:12.497 --> 01:43:13.899]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[01:43:13.899 --> 01:43:17.241]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[01:43:17.241 --> 01:43:18.502]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge.
[01:43:18.502 --> 01:43:22.506]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[01:43:22.506 --> 01:43:23.747]  So those are the type of discussions we had.
[01:43:23.747 --> 01:43:25.988]  I'm just giving you the inside baseball of all of this.
[01:43:25.988 --> 01:43:28.971]  This is 100 times regular volume plus.
[01:43:28.971 --> 01:43:30.232]  It was 100 times a few days ago.
[01:43:30.232 --> 01:43:30.933]  Now it's about 200 times.
[01:43:31.613 --> 01:43:36.374]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[01:44:01.238 --> 01:44:03.981]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[01:44:03.981 --> 01:44:05.682]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[01:44:05.682 --> 01:44:07.344]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[01:44:07.344 --> 01:44:08.285]  That was a crazy week.
[01:44:08.285 --> 01:44:19.976]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the InfoWars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[01:44:19.976 --> 01:44:21.278]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[01:44:22.762 --> 01:44:25.164]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[01:44:25.164 --> 01:44:26.545]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[01:44:26.545 --> 01:44:30.788]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[01:44:30.788 --> 01:44:33.029]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[01:44:33.029 --> 01:44:34.530]  I don't think that happens very often.
[01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:35.331]  It's never happened to me.
[01:44:35.331 --> 01:44:38.253]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[01:44:38.253 --> 01:44:39.954]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[01:44:40.114 --> 01:44:42.856]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[01:44:42.856 --> 01:44:50.843]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your health right now, and support the resistance.
[01:44:50.843 --> 01:44:54.146]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[01:44:54.146 --> 01:44:55.687]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[01:44:57.247 --> 01:45:03.891]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election, and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[01:45:03.891 --> 01:45:14.497]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in the
[01:45:14.977 --> 01:45:24.302]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[01:45:24.302 --> 01:45:36.387]  That's why it's so critical to go to InfoWarStore.com and stock up on high-quality preparedness items from storable foods, high-quality water filtration, air filtration, to the very best supplements and silver products you're going to find.
[01:45:36.387 --> 01:45:44.211]  They're all available at InfoWarStore.com, and your purchase there not only ensures high-quality products for you and your family at great prices, but it funds the InfoWar
[01:45:44.451 --> 01:45:46.012]  You want to break some globalist ribs?
[01:45:46.012 --> 01:45:47.812]  You want to crush some skulls politically?
[01:45:47.812 --> 01:45:50.213]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs, spiritually?
[01:45:50.213 --> 01:45:51.954]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[01:45:51.954 --> 01:45:53.794]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[01:46:10.191 --> 01:46:13.532]  In a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[01:46:13.532 --> 01:46:24.835]  Your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[01:46:24.835 --> 01:46:25.956]  And so it's very simple.
[01:46:25.956 --> 01:46:33.098]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[01:46:33.098 --> 01:46:35.999]  110% God will finish the move.
[01:46:35.999 --> 01:46:39.560]  And I know I need to stay in the fight, in the attack, attack, attack.
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:17.228 --> 01:47:34.757]  It is staggering to me to watch the entire corporate media from Disney to ABC to CNN defending sexualization of children and pedophilia.
[01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:45.672]  And that's why, from the bottom of my heart, I thank the listeners for supporting InfoWars with your prayers, by spreading the word, and by buying products to keep us on air.
[01:47:45.672 --> 01:47:47.953]  That's all I want, is to beat these people.
[01:47:47.953 --> 01:47:49.453]  My God.
[01:47:49.453 --> 01:47:52.134]  It's so incredibly evil, the things they do.
[01:47:52.134 --> 01:47:53.814]  It's so amazing.
[01:47:53.814 --> 01:47:57.555]  But we're still here on air, and you're spreading the word, and people are waking up.
[01:47:57.555 --> 01:48:03.417]  But you see why they want planetary control to carry out their evil desires against our children.
[01:48:03.417 --> 01:48:04.937]  It's not just the Muslims that want
[01:48:06.325 --> 01:48:06.725]  We're good to go.

[01:49:13.177 --> 01:49:13.957]  Others don't.
[01:49:13.957 --> 01:49:14.618]  They're lying to you.
[01:49:14.618 --> 01:49:16.358]  It's crazy.
[01:49:16.358 --> 01:49:19.399]  But we have things that boost your immune system, and that is just as important.
[01:49:19.399 --> 01:49:22.160]  So get your DNA Force Plus at Inforrestore.com.

[01:49:32.363 --> 01:49:33.164]  We're good to go.
[01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:55.542]  They won't.
[01:49:55.542 --> 01:50:07.469]  Any towns with large Muslim populations, mothers have been screaming out in Kifli, in different areas, there's been blocks by council, by government, to get any numbers in these towns and cities for how many victims and how many perpetrators.
[01:50:07.469 --> 01:50:10.991]  The only two we've been given the numbers for, 1.8% Muslim population and a 3.7% Muslim population.
[01:50:13.352 --> 01:50:17.114]  So they're relatively small Muslim populations compared to many of the towns and cities.
[01:50:17.114 --> 01:50:20.795]  And we've got 1,000 victims in one, 1,400 victims in the other.
[01:50:20.795 --> 01:50:23.176]  The amount of rapists we've got across our country.
[01:50:23.176 --> 01:50:28.559]  And this is when I started going through all the towns and cities, looking at statistics, reading.
[01:50:28.559 --> 01:50:35.542]  I prepared and started looking through what the victims are called, all the racial slurs, the religious comments made in these cases.
[01:50:36.138 --> 01:50:41.403]  And then I listened to the rapists, I listened to the victims, and then I looked at the scripture to see if there's defence of it.
[01:50:41.403 --> 01:50:50.812]  So, that's why I prepared a, it's a long presentation, I gave it the other week in Russia, looking and, basically, my government have just come out and said they're not going to give the findings of their investigation.
[01:50:50.812 --> 01:50:54.696]  They've done a five-year investigation into the characteristics of these gangs.
[01:50:54.696 --> 01:50:59.801]  What is driving these gangs are 84% of the convictions are Muslim men.
[01:50:59.801 --> 01:51:00.642]  What's driving them?
[01:51:01.112 --> 01:51:02.853]  And they're not going to tell the public.
[01:51:02.853 --> 01:51:03.694]  Why not?
[01:51:03.694 --> 01:51:08.877]  Because if they tell the public, we'll understand these are Islamic motivated rapes.
[01:51:08.877 --> 01:51:11.779]  This is supported by scripture.
[01:51:11.779 --> 01:51:24.748]  These men's actions are coming from their intolerance and their belief in the system that they follow, that views non-Muslim women, that says they can take non-Muslim women as sexual slaves, that says multiple times in the Quran that they can do this.
[01:51:24.748 --> 01:51:25.469]  That attitude,
[01:51:25.829 --> 01:51:28.131]  That mindset, where does it come from?
[01:51:28.131 --> 01:51:30.253]  That's what the investigation by the government should have been.
[01:51:30.253 --> 01:51:34.016]  And I dug back, and in this presentation, I go through and look at all of this.
[01:51:34.016 --> 01:51:36.859]  But we still have so many people, the government, it's got nothing to do with this stuff.
[01:51:36.859 --> 01:51:39.040]  By the way, I want to air your presentation in Russia.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:41.703]  Do we find that on your website?
[01:51:41.703 --> 01:51:47.848]  We're just editing it now, so in about a week you'll be ready because they had so much footage to go through.
[01:51:47.848 --> 01:51:50.290]  I want you to come on and intro it.
[01:51:50.290 --> 01:51:53.553]  I'd like to premiere it here and have it on your site, but will you please premiere it with us?
[01:51:54.284 --> 01:51:55.405]  Of course, yeah, of course.
[01:51:55.405 --> 01:51:58.706]  Promise you'll tell us what you hear.
[01:51:58.706 --> 01:52:01.547]  Did I just hear Andrew Tate on your advertising?
[01:52:01.547 --> 01:52:02.788]  Yes.
[01:52:02.788 --> 01:52:03.388]  Wicked, man.
[01:52:03.388 --> 01:52:05.549]  You know Andrew's from Luton?
[01:52:05.549 --> 01:52:06.590]  Yeah.
[01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:07.930]  Yeah, he's a Luton lad.
[01:52:07.930 --> 01:52:09.111]  Yeah, world champion.
[01:52:09.111 --> 01:52:10.291]  Four times world champion.
[01:52:10.291 --> 01:52:11.312]  Yeah, he's a Luton lad.
[01:52:11.312 --> 01:52:12.092]  He's a Luton lad, son.
[01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:13.753]  Yeah, he's a tough guy.
[01:52:13.753 --> 01:52:18.435]  Yeah, he's a tough guy, man, and he's a... Yeah, him and his brother, born and bred in Luton.
[01:52:18.435 --> 01:52:22.177]  They're not there now, but... You look at his hands, they look like steel.
[01:52:23.137 --> 01:52:23.758]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:52:23.758 --> 01:52:24.438]  And he smashed it.
[01:52:24.438 --> 01:52:25.719]  He's so successful.
[01:52:25.719 --> 01:52:27.480]  He's done great since day dot.
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:29.322]  He was, he come from nothing.
[01:52:29.322 --> 01:52:31.043]  If you know where he lived, yeah?
[01:52:31.043 --> 01:52:35.147]  He lived in the roughest and toughest estate in our town.
[01:52:35.147 --> 01:52:41.412]  The estate that was burned, like, is famous for, there was massive riots for days there.
[01:52:41.412 --> 01:52:44.354]  It's where, there's the gun violence, the crime that's there.
[01:52:44.354 --> 01:52:46.275]  And, yeah, that's where he's from.
[01:52:46.275 --> 01:52:46.496]  And he's,
[01:52:47.543 --> 01:53:00.069]  He's always said, he's been so confident in everything he says, and that's why I admire him, because so many people get annoyed by him, because he says, this is how you're successful, I'm going to make it, I'm going to be rich, I'm going to be powerful.
[01:53:00.069 --> 01:53:03.771]  And he's a proper alpha male, which people hate.
[01:53:03.771 --> 01:53:07.172]  The globals are threatened by male energy that isn't evil.
[01:53:07.172 --> 01:53:07.973]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:53:07.973 --> 01:53:10.514]  So yeah, I was sitting here listening to that voice, and I was like,
[01:53:11.995 --> 01:53:14.677]  And then I heard him start talking and I thought, Andrew Tate!
[01:53:14.677 --> 01:53:17.119]  I've just sent him a voice note saying, what's going on?
[01:53:17.119 --> 01:53:18.460]  I just heard you on InfoWars, bro.
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:20.401]  In fact, when I heard that ad, I hadn't heard it in about a month.
[01:53:20.401 --> 01:53:23.884]  We need to get Andrew Tate back on the show, so please set that up.
[01:53:23.884 --> 01:53:26.326]  Speaking of something depressing though, let's play this clip.
[01:53:26.326 --> 01:53:29.248]  This is your daughter, eight years old, after being assaulted.
[01:53:29.248 --> 01:53:31.670]  But the media is now attacking and saying she's a liar.
[01:53:31.670 --> 01:53:33.712]  No Muslim could ever commit a crime.
[01:53:33.712 --> 01:53:34.813]  They're angels.
[01:53:34.813 --> 01:53:35.393]  They're perfect.
[01:53:35.393 --> 01:53:37.135]  They're better than Jesus Christ.
[01:53:37.135 --> 01:53:40.117]  So here she is talking about what just happened a few days ago.
[01:53:40.117 --> 01:53:40.898]  Who is he with, the man?
[01:53:42.079 --> 01:53:45.060]  Did you see when he was coming out of the pool?
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:47.480]  No, I don't think his family was there.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:51.121]  It was just on his own.
[01:53:51.121 --> 01:53:52.281]  And which way was you facing?
[01:53:52.281 --> 01:53:53.561]  Tell me which looks better.
[01:53:53.561 --> 01:53:58.682]  You know there's that side furthest away?
[01:53:58.682 --> 01:53:59.383]  Yeah.
[01:53:59.383 --> 01:54:05.904]  And a little bit more than I was standing there, and then he walked that way.
[01:54:05.904 --> 01:54:06.604]  Walked round you?
[01:54:06.604 --> 01:54:08.345]  So say like this is the pool, yeah?
[01:54:08.345 --> 01:54:08.845]  On your way out.
[01:54:08.845 --> 01:54:10.065]  You come out this way, yeah?
[01:54:10.065 --> 01:54:10.505]  Right.
[01:54:11.363 --> 01:54:14.064]  Was you standing this way?
[01:54:14.064 --> 01:54:18.026]  You were standing facing, so your back was against the wall.
[01:54:18.026 --> 01:54:18.366]  No.
[01:54:18.366 --> 01:54:19.226]  No, the other way then.
[01:54:19.226 --> 01:54:20.347]  I was talking to me.
[01:54:20.347 --> 01:54:21.767]  Oh yeah, yeah, so you're looking there, yeah, yeah.
[01:54:21.767 --> 01:54:23.688]  So you're there, and then he's come through where?
[01:54:23.688 --> 01:54:24.528]  Um, there.
[01:54:24.528 --> 01:54:27.850]  And then that's the entrance.
[01:54:27.850 --> 01:54:30.931]  So, if you're standing there like that, he's gone past you like this?
[01:54:30.931 --> 01:54:31.651]  Yeah.
[01:54:31.651 --> 01:54:32.852]  And then how, and then done what?
[01:54:33.649 --> 01:54:34.509]  Squeeze my bum.
[01:54:34.509 --> 01:54:35.510]  Squeeze your bum like that?
[01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:36.490]  Yeah.
[01:54:36.490 --> 01:54:41.191]  Oh, so it's not like he's even accidentally... So, you're like this or you're like this?
[01:54:41.191 --> 01:54:42.072]  Talking to him.
[01:54:42.072 --> 01:54:43.272]  You're saying talking to Macy?
[01:54:43.272 --> 01:54:44.992]  He's gone past like that?
[01:54:44.992 --> 01:54:45.213]  Macy.
[01:54:45.213 --> 01:54:47.133]  OK, and then gone like that?
[01:54:47.133 --> 01:54:47.333]  Yeah.
[01:54:47.333 --> 01:54:51.694]  And when you say squeeze your bum, could he have rushed past and accidentally knocked your bum?
[01:54:51.694 --> 01:54:51.815]  No.
[01:54:51.815 --> 01:54:53.035]  No?
[01:54:53.035 --> 01:54:53.735]  Show me like what?
[01:54:53.735 --> 01:54:55.716]  Like this.
[01:54:55.716 --> 01:54:58.417]  Like a squeeze with your hand, like a clinch.
[01:54:58.417 --> 01:54:59.537]  Like that, like a squeeze.
[01:55:01.744 --> 01:55:05.367]  So on your, on your, which cheek?
[01:55:05.367 --> 01:55:06.668]  Uh, this one.
[01:55:06.668 --> 01:55:07.289]  On that bum cheek?
[01:55:07.289 --> 01:55:09.070]  Yeah.
[01:55:09.070 --> 01:55:12.713]  Okay.
[01:55:12.713 --> 01:55:14.174]  And what did he say, what did you say?
[01:55:14.174 --> 01:55:15.976]  Has he done it?
[01:55:15.976 --> 01:55:17.077]  Did you?
[01:55:17.077 --> 01:55:19.098]  No, then I went straight out of the pool and told him.
[01:55:19.098 --> 01:55:20.920]  That's when you come running up?
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:21.721]  And what did he say?
[01:55:21.721 --> 01:55:22.501]  Nothing?
[01:55:22.501 --> 01:55:23.782]  Nothing at all?
[01:55:23.782 --> 01:55:24.363]  Did he look at you?
[01:55:24.363 --> 01:55:26.164]  No.
[01:55:26.164 --> 01:55:26.745]  Just walked off?
[01:55:29.312 --> 01:55:30.953]  On his own?
[01:55:30.953 --> 01:55:32.453]  Yeah.
[01:55:32.453 --> 01:55:32.533]  Oh.
[01:55:32.533 --> 01:55:38.155]  Oh, man.
[01:55:38.155 --> 01:55:46.978]  I gotta tell you, Tommy Robinson showed real restraint, because, again, I'm not trying to... My daughter comes up and tells me somebody did that, and the guy admits he did it.
[01:55:46.978 --> 01:55:47.758]  Head's going to the concrete.
[01:55:47.758 --> 01:55:49.138]  We're gonna play basketball.
[01:55:49.138 --> 01:55:50.219]  And you know what?
[01:55:50.219 --> 01:55:52.559]  Then they wouldn't be able to cover it up, though, because his brain's gonna be everywhere.
[01:55:52.559 --> 01:55:53.860]  But I get your restraint.
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:56.521]  But they just turned this guy into a victim.
[01:55:56.521 --> 01:55:57.101]  And the thing is...
[01:55:57.873 --> 01:56:04.695]  Like, if it's a mistake, which is what he tried to say, if it's a mistake, if you touch or grab a young girl, how do you do that?
[01:56:04.695 --> 01:56:05.215]  I don't know.
[01:56:05.215 --> 01:56:07.175]  But if you did, you say sorry.
[01:56:07.175 --> 01:56:08.716]  That's why I said to her, what did he say?
[01:56:08.716 --> 01:56:13.117]  Well, if you grab a full-grown woman's ass, you get a ticket or you go to jail or her husband kicks your ass.
[01:56:13.117 --> 01:56:15.337]  You grab an eight-year-old's ass, you get your teeth knocked out.
[01:56:15.337 --> 01:56:18.358]  I mean, this is out of control, man.
[01:56:18.358 --> 01:56:25.260]  And how can police officers sit, get told what I got told there, and then not arrest him?
[01:56:26.047 --> 01:56:28.708]  But handcuff me and take me away.
[01:56:28.708 --> 01:56:35.811]  Hey, this guy that raped the girl in the bathroom who'd been let go, he admits that the Democrats were saying release him.
[01:56:35.811 --> 01:56:39.932]  And if you listen... And shot the woman in the back and said he did it and the left let him go.
[01:56:39.932 --> 01:56:41.233]  They said you're allowed to kill her, she's white.
[01:56:42.372 --> 01:56:50.742]  In this same video, in this same video, when I'm getting released from the police station, they make it very clear, if I tell anyone his name, so I know his name, I've got a picture of him here.
[01:56:50.742 --> 01:56:54.847]  If I tell anyone his name, I breach my bail, which means I go straight to prison.
[01:56:54.847 --> 01:56:57.831]  I'm not allowed to tell anyone who he is.
[01:56:59.123 --> 01:57:01.005]  It's dramatic footage of you with the police.
[01:57:01.005 --> 01:57:03.808]  We should bleep it out and play it, but... I mean, you couldn't believe it.
[01:57:03.808 --> 01:57:05.509]  When you called them, they came and arrested you.
[01:57:05.509 --> 01:57:07.151]  What evil scum!
[01:57:07.151 --> 01:57:09.213]  They really are scum in the UK.
[01:57:09.213 --> 01:57:11.975]  I mean, the police have just become total globalists.
[01:57:11.975 --> 01:57:14.338]  They're the sword to kill England.
[01:57:14.338 --> 01:57:17.561]  They are... How do they hire this trash?
[01:57:17.561 --> 01:57:19.883]  The media... I'm quite...
[01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:22.430]  Sitting watching the public's reaction.
[01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:26.133]  Now, there's many people, many Muslims, say, look, I don't like Tommy Robbins, I hate him.
[01:57:26.133 --> 01:57:28.055]  But what the fuck is this?
[01:57:28.055 --> 01:57:29.356]  What has happened here?
[01:57:29.356 --> 01:57:32.738]  There's so many people who are against me, which is encouraging.
[01:57:32.738 --> 01:57:34.279]  The real people, the real left wing people.
[01:57:34.279 --> 01:57:35.960]  You're going to host the last five minutes.
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:38.262]  I'm going to shut up and have you have final comments.
[01:57:38.262 --> 01:57:40.144]  Then we got a bunch of news we haven't had.
[01:57:40.144 --> 01:57:44.387]  Democrats are now publicly calling for coronavirus to kill Republicans.
[01:57:45.717 --> 01:57:54.045]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[01:57:54.045 --> 01:58:01.012]  And instead of just giving into sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[01:58:01.012 --> 01:58:03.114]  And I say that from personal experience.
[01:58:03.234 --> 01:58:18.150]  Because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day and that power pack that they have, the AM PM power pack, well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:21.834]  I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that
[01:58:21.834 --> 01:58:40.231]  But beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose, for our families and for our communities.
[01:58:40.231 --> 01:58:45.496]  And right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[01:58:47.034 --> 01:58:49.276]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:49.276 --> 01:58:51.478]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:51.478 --> 01:58:53.500]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:59:02.769]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of InfoWarsTore.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best
[01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:05.171]  Well, it gives people the best results.
[01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:08.894]  We either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[01:59:08.894 --> 01:59:13.758]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[01:59:13.758 --> 01:59:16.641]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[01:59:16.641 --> 01:59:17.581]  It's incredible.
[01:59:17.581 --> 01:59:19.223]  So do yourself a favor.
[01:59:19.223 --> 01:59:21.725]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[01:59:21.725 --> 01:59:24.607]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action.
[01:59:24.607 --> 01:59:29.271]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering.
[01:59:29.271 --> 01:59:31.573]  Thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[01:59:32.133 --> 01:59:33.434]  But you need these products.
[01:59:33.434 --> 01:59:36.496]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[01:59:36.496 --> 01:59:40.420]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:44.263]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO, instead of imploding.
[01:59:44.263 --> 01:59:49.327]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning, thanks to you.
[01:59:49.327 --> 01:59:51.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.324 --> 02:00:09.346]  His crime is being a man, a father, a husband.
[02:00:09.346 --> 02:00:12.267]  His crime is he can't lay down.
[02:00:12.267 --> 02:00:14.508]  He's been vindicated.
[02:00:14.508 --> 02:00:21.770]  The town he exposed for giant child kidnapping sex rings where children were murdered, years later was confirmed exactly as he said.
[02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:25.251]  You can't carry a man like that on your shoulders.
[02:00:25.251 --> 02:00:27.512]  He's an example to others.
[02:00:27.512 --> 02:00:30.033]  No, you have to imprison him and torture him and destroy him.
[02:00:31.027 --> 02:00:33.749]  And now the scourge of the giant.
[02:00:33.749 --> 02:00:36.871]  Rape gangs are so bad his own daughter's assaulted.
[02:00:36.871 --> 02:00:38.712]  The man admits it on tape.
[02:00:38.712 --> 02:00:41.354]  But Tommy Robinson is arrested.
[02:00:41.354 --> 02:00:43.196]  That's the nature of tyranny.
[02:00:43.196 --> 02:00:44.456]  Tommy, we've got four minutes to break.
[02:00:44.456 --> 02:00:48.839]  I want you to have a final statement here and post the last four minutes.
[02:00:48.839 --> 02:00:52.742]  My final statement would start with where the battle is.
[02:00:52.742 --> 02:00:55.544]  The battle is in information.
[02:00:55.544 --> 02:00:56.465]  Perfect for InfoWars.
[02:00:56.465 --> 02:00:57.986]  The battle is in information in the sense that
[02:00:59.193 --> 02:01:01.997]  Anyone who's watched the video of what happened with me, it's gone viral.
[02:01:01.997 --> 02:01:04.301]  I'm happy that millions have seen it.
[02:01:04.301 --> 02:01:05.363]  Millions have seen the truth.
[02:01:05.959 --> 02:01:18.270]  But by removing my social media and my ability to talk about it, by taking away my platforms, every mainstream media news outlet is now lying to my country, to everyone, saying a completely different narrative.
[02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:26.298]  No mention of an assault against my daughter, just pushing, and they know that most people only read the headline, so pushing the headline that I've attacked someone who's innocent.
[02:01:26.298 --> 02:01:27.819]  He's the victim in this, apparently.
[02:01:27.819 --> 02:01:31.242]  The man that sexually assaulted my daughter is the victim, which is why
[02:01:32.023 --> 02:01:53.596]  A platform, Alex, or InfoWars, like you have here, and alternative platforms, and you, every single one of you watching this, everyone that's shared the video, everyone that's gone on social media and received a ban from Facebook, everyone that's gone on YouTube and re-uploaded it themselves, you're the reason, because I don't have a platform, you're the reason that four or five million people have watched that video in the last 24 hours.
[02:01:53.596 --> 02:01:54.636]  You're the reason.
[02:01:54.636 --> 02:01:58.218]  So that's knowing that we are ourselves, the media.
[02:01:58.218 --> 02:02:01.160]  Alex, sorry, my breathing is always terrible, but whilst I'm on that,
[02:02:01.849 --> 02:02:14.435]  How I come out of custody in October, and I needed a break, and I sit here, Alex, and I watch you, and I know the stresses or the pressures that this throws at you, whether it be court cases.
[02:02:14.435 --> 02:02:19.917]  I'm in court on the 12th of this month, the 24th of this month, and now the 2nd of April.
[02:02:20.484 --> 02:02:23.226]  It is lawfare.
[02:02:23.226 --> 02:02:26.448]  They tie you up, and I know you've faced the same prosecutions.
[02:02:26.448 --> 02:02:28.850]  You're facing the same attacks against you.
[02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:32.973]  So I admire the fact that you haven't even had a break.
[02:02:32.973 --> 02:02:33.674]  I've had a break.
[02:02:33.674 --> 02:02:34.534]  I went quiet.
[02:02:34.534 --> 02:02:35.955]  And when I went quiet, people said, where's Tommy?
[02:02:35.955 --> 02:02:36.916]  What's he doing?
[02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:40.719]  I was making sure my family are right, my kids are right, because I've had instances at my home.
[02:02:40.719 --> 02:02:42.100]  They've had to move.
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:42.820]  I've had problems.
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:44.161]  Now I've had this next problem.
[02:02:44.161 --> 02:02:46.403]  So yeah, I've watched as
[02:02:47.429 --> 02:02:52.813]  As you just crack on, rolling into towns on the top of tanks and that.
[02:02:52.813 --> 02:02:59.839]  I just see, every time after I flick through and try to keep up with what's going on, I see Alex Jones steeping into it with a tank and a megaphone.
[02:02:59.839 --> 02:03:00.959]  Go on, son!
[02:03:00.959 --> 02:03:01.820]  Go on!
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:06.744]  But yeah, I'd like every one of you sharing it.
[02:03:06.744 --> 02:03:10.527]  My biggest worry here is that my daughter will think she's done something wrong.
[02:03:10.527 --> 02:03:14.610]  Can you imagine the consequence for my eight-year-old child if I'm sent to prison for this?
[02:03:15.592 --> 02:03:16.673]  Can you imagine what that's going to be?
[02:03:16.673 --> 02:03:19.195]  And I know so many people are talking about coming out and supporting me.
[02:03:19.195 --> 02:03:22.697]  It's on the 2nd of April at Luton Magistrates Court.
[02:03:22.697 --> 02:03:30.363]  I should not be in court for handling a paedophile who had sexually assaulted my daughter.
[02:03:30.363 --> 02:03:32.925]  And he should have been arrested and he hasn't been arrested.
[02:03:32.925 --> 02:03:35.667]  I can't believe we've chased up today, my daughter's chased up today.
[02:03:35.667 --> 02:03:42.853]  I'm also looking at two other options of private prosecutions because people are threatening to kill me, they're threatening to kill my family, they're threatening to kill my children.
[02:03:42.853 --> 02:03:43.653]  No one's arrested.
[02:03:43.653 --> 02:03:44.394]  Please do not arrest them.
[02:03:45.279 --> 02:03:47.820]  The rule of law is not implemented equally.
[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:48.880]  It's just not.
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:50.721]  You're seeing the mad craze now.
[02:03:50.721 --> 02:03:54.783]  I'm watching what's happening with the refugee crisis.
[02:03:54.783 --> 02:03:56.624]  The future.
[02:03:56.624 --> 02:03:58.044]  It's worrying for everyone.
[02:03:58.044 --> 02:04:00.565]  But where do we start?
[02:04:00.565 --> 02:04:04.327]  I am, or I have recently, I've been talking.
[02:04:04.327 --> 02:04:05.227]  And look at that.
[02:04:05.227 --> 02:04:07.988]  Look, Tommy Robertson arrested for restraining a man who sexually assaulted his daughter.
[02:04:07.988 --> 02:04:08.828]  That's on ours.
[02:04:08.828 --> 02:04:11.249]  Every other news headline is just that I've attacked someone.
[02:04:11.249 --> 02:04:13.810]  And do you know what is more sickening for me?
[02:04:13.810 --> 02:04:14.951]  Is what's happened to my daughter but
[02:04:15.663 --> 02:04:20.952]  Watching the way it's been used by the left and by the media to completely attack me.
[02:04:20.952 --> 02:04:21.373]  You know what?
[02:04:21.373 --> 02:04:22.335]  You can hate me.
[02:04:22.335 --> 02:04:23.176]  Hate me, yeah?
[02:04:23.176 --> 02:04:24.138]  If you want to hate me.
[02:04:24.138 --> 02:04:25.320]  Attack me if you want to attack me.
[02:04:25.922 --> 02:04:29.304]  But my eight-year-old daughter is innocent in all of this.
[02:04:29.304 --> 02:04:32.085]  Tommy, you're absolutely right, but here's the good news.
[02:04:32.085 --> 02:04:34.406]  No one I know is buying in.
[02:04:34.406 --> 02:04:37.707]  And these police and the government are aiding and abetting the rape of the people.
[02:04:37.707 --> 02:04:39.048]  Tommy, we love you.
[02:04:39.048 --> 02:04:42.689]  Next week, when your big speech comes out, we really want to have you here with us.
[02:04:42.689 --> 02:04:44.510]  And please stay in contact, brother, and keep it up.
[02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:45.971]  And your daughter knows the truth.
[02:04:45.971 --> 02:04:46.871]  She doesn't feel bad.
[02:04:46.871 --> 02:04:47.552]  She knows justice.
[02:04:47.552 --> 02:04:48.152]  She knows God.
[02:04:48.152 --> 02:04:49.452]  She has a great father and a great mother.
[02:04:49.452 --> 02:04:52.214]  And we ought to salute your wife, what she's been through.
[02:04:52.214 --> 02:04:53.014]  Thank you so much, Tommy.
[02:04:54.955 --> 02:04:56.880]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:03.097]  Coronavirus is a man-made bio-weapon designed to destroy nation-states, economies, and freedoms.
[02:05:04.036 --> 02:05:06.797]  And usher in a planetary government.
[02:05:06.797 --> 02:05:09.217]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[02:05:09.217 --> 02:05:11.297]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[02:05:11.297 --> 02:05:18.179]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3,000 cruise ship passengers return home.
[02:05:18.179 --> 02:05:20.719]  And that's just in one nation.
[02:05:20.719 --> 02:05:25.500]  Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China.
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:29.661]  They're reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[02:05:30.502 --> 02:05:33.664]  That's how major this is.
[02:05:33.664 --> 02:05:35.425]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[02:05:35.425 --> 02:05:39.107]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[02:05:39.107 --> 02:05:48.373]  InfoWars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out, regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[02:05:48.373 --> 02:05:53.997]  We need you to step to the plate and help spread the word about Bandot Video and InfoWars.com today.
[02:05:58.803 --> 02:06:01.364]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:01.364 --> 02:06:07.526]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:11.387]  I'll tell you something personal about me.
[02:06:11.387 --> 02:06:14.668]  Only because I know you love me and I love you too.
[02:06:14.668 --> 02:06:18.949]  We found victory against the enemy, so what we've done should be studied and looked at so others can be stronger.
[02:06:22.521 --> 02:06:30.904]  I know that people want to turn their emotions off and stop caring because the amount of evil is so incredible, but I don't do that.
[02:06:30.904 --> 02:06:43.129]  I just let it all hit me and I take it all in because I may not be Christ-like when it comes to turning the other cheek, but I'm ready to take on the fight and I'm ready to face the enemy for the innocent.
[02:06:44.318 --> 02:06:46.859]  And that's why I can cry on demand.
[02:06:46.859 --> 02:06:55.964]  Because if I start thinking about the innocents, I can't cry for my grandmother that died three years ago, I love so much, because I know she's with God.
[02:06:55.964 --> 02:07:02.087]  But I think about the innocents being tortured, just one second, and I start crying like a baby.
[02:07:02.087 --> 02:07:06.289]  And that tells me as a man, I've got a job to do.
[02:07:06.289 --> 02:07:11.432]  And that's why we've got to be wise, and we've got to be judicious, and we have to be very violent with the truth, though.
[02:07:12.768 --> 02:07:15.849]  And use it as a weapon and not hold back.
[02:07:15.849 --> 02:07:25.412]  You know, when you're in a fight and somebody's hurting you bad, you find that place to either give up or get up and hurt them really bad.
[02:07:25.412 --> 02:07:31.714]  And it's at that point you find who you are.
[02:07:31.714 --> 02:07:35.034]  But now, our worst analysis is true.
[02:07:35.034 --> 02:07:38.776]  What all the old timers told us, what the Bible told us, it's all 100% real.
[02:07:46.897 --> 02:07:49.579]  It's sad, but you know what?
[02:07:49.579 --> 02:07:52.081]  We can't sit there and lay down to it.
[02:07:52.081 --> 02:07:55.683]  And so, we've got to do whatever it takes.
[02:07:55.683 --> 02:08:02.688]  But I tell you, all of you out there shooting your mouths off about when the UN helmets come, you're going to kill some people.
[02:08:02.688 --> 02:08:04.189]  They're not going to come in UN helmets.
[02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:10.034]  They're going to come as school teachers and professors and bureaucrats and police that the enemy controls.
[02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:25.545]  So if you're not down at the City Council, and the PTA, and the school board, and at the Capitol, state and federal, and if you're not praying to God every night, and if you're not taking action, you're never gonna kill people when the time comes.
[02:08:25.545 --> 02:08:27.365]  That's easy.
[02:08:27.365 --> 02:08:29.846]  Killing people's like wiping your ass.
[02:08:29.846 --> 02:08:31.967]  It ain't hard.
[02:08:31.967 --> 02:08:34.848]  And it's not hard for people like us, and they know that.
[02:08:34.848 --> 02:08:36.929]  They're scared of us.
[02:08:36.929 --> 02:08:39.249]  If we used our knowledge for evil, it'd be unbelievable.
[02:08:39.249 --> 02:08:40.310]  But we're not evil.
[02:08:41.144 --> 02:08:45.389]  That's why we've been given power.
[02:08:45.389 --> 02:08:47.792]  We don't want the power.
[02:08:47.792 --> 02:08:54.580]  And so we don't use our rightful birthright and power because it seems arrogant to us.
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:58.825]  Well, you better start using that power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:00.742 --> 02:09:08.345]  For all you men that sit there and how, world government ever takes over, they ever try something on me, I'll go to war!
[02:09:08.345 --> 02:09:12.847]  Yeah, I haven't seen jack crap out of those people.
[02:09:12.847 --> 02:09:22.851]  But the listeners and viewers of this show, that's why it's a sickening thing when you call in and tell me how great I am, because I'm just doing my job and so are you.
[02:09:22.851 --> 02:09:26.772]  You're awesome.
[02:09:26.772 --> 02:09:28.173]  The fact that you came here,
[02:09:30.848 --> 02:09:35.110]  The fact that we're together, that's all you need to know about the universe.
[02:09:35.110 --> 02:09:54.619]  Because the Lord works in mysterious ways, but... I was thinking this morning... I thought, right after I worked out and took a shower... I thought, should I tell the globalists how much I've enjoyed their persecution?
[02:09:54.619 --> 02:09:57.641]  How much it's made me stronger?
[02:09:57.641 --> 02:10:00.142]  How I thank God for allowing that to happen.
[02:10:07.625 --> 02:10:12.647]  Will that make them persecute me even more?
[02:10:12.647 --> 02:10:15.568]  And I think the only way to tell the story is just to tell the story about the thought.
[02:10:15.568 --> 02:10:18.470]  I don't know.
[02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:24.432]  But I haven't enjoyed the things that have happened, but then I do enjoy them later.
[02:10:24.432 --> 02:10:34.097]  The worst things that ever happened to me in my life are the best things that ever happened to me later.
[02:10:34.097 --> 02:10:37.078]  And we just have to get to the point where we're not scared of these people anymore.
[02:10:39.758 --> 02:10:41.439]  And we're not intimidated by them anymore.
[02:10:41.439 --> 02:10:43.920]  And it's all very sophisticated.
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:45.181]  It's hard with words to describe it.
[02:10:45.181 --> 02:10:49.764]  I know you as an audience of people that are informed and involved and interface with God.
[02:10:49.764 --> 02:10:55.287]  You understand what I'm saying.
[02:10:55.287 --> 02:10:58.969]  But it comes down to this.
[02:10:58.969 --> 02:11:02.411]  We didn't come here looking for the fight.
[02:11:02.411 --> 02:11:03.412]  And we don't want the power.
[02:11:06.587 --> 02:11:14.812]  Those that want to carry out these satanic operations are going to get everything they're looking for.
[02:11:14.812 --> 02:11:23.837]  They're going to get stomped every bone they've got broken, every eye gouged out, and we're going to tear their spiritual guts out.
[02:11:23.837 --> 02:11:28.899]  And we are going to throw them into the pit of hell forever where they deserve to go.
[02:11:28.899 --> 02:11:32.461]  Because justice is right.
[02:11:32.461 --> 02:11:34.282]  Justice is wrought.
[02:11:34.282 --> 02:11:35.103]  Justice is good.
[02:11:37.435 --> 02:11:40.237]  And they will not escape God.
[02:11:40.237 --> 02:11:43.760]  They will never escape justice.
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:49.024]  And I don't take pleasure in the fact that there are people that serve evil.
[02:11:49.024 --> 02:11:56.570]  But I take extreme victory.
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:11.864]  Out of the fact that we're going to remove them off the backs and the souls of our young people and the young spirits coming into the universe.
[02:12:11.864 --> 02:12:15.225]  Because we can do incredible things through Christ.
[02:12:15.225 --> 02:12:16.746]  All things are possible.
[02:12:16.746 --> 02:12:19.166]  And we're going to do it.
[02:12:19.166 --> 02:12:23.528]  And I realized this morning, I already knew this, but it was a moment of perfect peace.
[02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:49.106]  That as long as they can't demoralize you and make you feel like a loser, even if you're being lined up to be guillotined or firing squatted or drawn and quartered, as long as you trust in God and center your soul with God, there's no power the enemy has that has any chance against us.
[02:12:49.106 --> 02:12:51.588]  But you must totally trust in God.
[02:12:52.659 --> 02:12:56.502]  And all I can say is, I've never asked God for things.
[02:12:56.502 --> 02:13:08.792]  When I'm in the presence of God, I just, since I was a little child, I'm just like, I'm in the presence of God, I'm not gonna sit there and tell God what to do.
[02:13:08.792 --> 02:13:13.196]  And that spirit comforts you, it's so strong.
[02:13:13.196 --> 02:13:21.662]  And that God says, I really don't wanna see you hurt, but you see what they're doing to other people.
[02:13:23.197 --> 02:13:29.558]  Are you ready to really get hurt bad?
[02:13:29.558 --> 02:13:32.959]  You say, yeah, I'm ready to be hurt.
[02:13:32.959 --> 02:13:36.460]  So there's a hedge that if it falls, everyone will be hit by.
[02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:39.660]  And God says, I'm going to take the hedge out a little bit.
[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:41.241]  You feel that?
[02:13:41.241 --> 02:13:43.841]  That's what the children are being hit with.
[02:13:43.841 --> 02:13:47.502]  I want more and more and more and more.
[02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:53.772]  And there's a point each time you go through the spiritual pain that you get even closer to God.
[02:13:53.772 --> 02:14:11.699]  And by the points I've reached in the last few years, it's all a joke and it's finally clear sailing, except you see all the people that can't even imagine the power of the Almighty Creator of all the universe and all consciousness ready to give you everything.
[02:14:11.699 --> 02:14:15.220]  But you have free will and you must reject Satan.
[02:14:16.991 --> 02:14:21.014]  You look at Joe Biden and Hillary and Xi Jinping.
[02:14:21.014 --> 02:14:25.477]  They physically look like piles of maggots.
[02:14:25.477 --> 02:14:26.938]  They can't talk.
[02:14:26.938 --> 02:14:28.660]  They have no energy.
[02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:32.703]  They have nothing.
[02:14:32.703 --> 02:14:34.784]  They're dead.
[02:14:34.784 --> 02:14:39.328]  But they have helicopters and money and everyone bowing to them.
[02:14:39.328 --> 02:14:40.769]  It means nothing.
[02:14:47.008 --> 02:14:51.610]  True slaves and those that are deceived follow them.
[02:14:51.610 --> 02:14:57.233]  And so we can laugh at those that are deceived all day long, but we should mourn.
[02:14:57.233 --> 02:15:06.637]  Because that is a group of souls that are going to be taken into a whole another creation, a black hole.
[02:15:06.637 --> 02:15:14.801]  And who will be fed on for eternity, not through God's hate or animus, not through God's sadistic system, but through God's perfect
[02:15:15.842 --> 02:15:20.435]  Understanding of free will and giving you consciousness.
[02:15:20.435 --> 02:15:23.604]  And if you choose the devil, then it is what you deserve.
[02:15:24.531 --> 02:15:28.272]  We have a special guest joining us.
[02:15:28.272 --> 02:15:30.812]  I just can't read these headlines at a certain point.
[02:15:30.812 --> 02:15:34.333]  It's insane.
[02:15:34.333 --> 02:15:37.313]  And it's going to get more insane by the minute.
[02:15:37.313 --> 02:15:39.434]  Look at this headline, Infowars.com.
[02:15:39.434 --> 02:15:49.976]  Democrat councilwoman shows support for leftists wanting to intentionally spread coronavirus to Trump supporters.
[02:15:49.976 --> 02:15:50.976]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:15:54.132 --> 02:15:55.393]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:55.393 --> 02:15:56.674]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:56.674 --> 02:16:00.416]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:00.416 --> 02:16:01.497]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:01.497 --> 02:16:03.318]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:03.318 --> 02:16:05.039]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:16:23.988 --> 02:16:25.189]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:29.110]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:30.651]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:30.651 --> 02:16:33.613]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:33.613 --> 02:16:39.175]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:17:02.727 --> 02:17:11.093]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:20:11.537 --> 02:20:14.701]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[02:20:14.701 --> 02:20:16.342]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:46.417 --> 02:20:49.679]  Alright, Alex Jones here, back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:20:49.679 --> 02:20:52.080]  I wanted to play this clip.
[02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:53.841]  The full interview is on Infowars.com.
[02:20:53.841 --> 02:20:55.342]  It's gone viral.
[02:20:55.342 --> 02:20:59.504]  Roger Stone talks about accepting Jesus as his Lord and Savior.
[02:20:59.504 --> 02:21:06.948]  Now, I don't want to put Roger down, but if I tell you the real Roger Stone, he doesn't fit into the tough guy
[02:21:08.166 --> 02:21:08.486]  I don't know.
[02:21:34.318 --> 02:21:36.019]  He said, I noticed your inner strength.
[02:21:36.019 --> 02:21:39.821]  He wasn't BSing and your discernment, how you talk about God.
[02:21:39.821 --> 02:21:46.085]  And I had discussions with him about Jesus and discussions about how there are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:21:46.085 --> 02:21:48.907]  And I wouldn't call him really an atheist, but he was more agnostic.
[02:21:48.907 --> 02:21:56.612]  And it's got to be two years ago, I prayed with Roger Stone in my office.
[02:21:56.612 --> 02:21:57.452]  I said, give me your hand.
[02:21:57.452 --> 02:22:00.534]  Let's pray to Jesus for protection and for strength.
[02:22:00.534 --> 02:22:03.396]  And he talked about, to me personally, the strength he felt from that.
[02:22:04.198 --> 02:22:14.527]  And he said, it's just amazing, you know, I see the religious establishment and the corruption and I just think it's all BS, but under these attacks, I just feel drawn to God and this is real evil we're facing.
[02:22:14.527 --> 02:22:19.651]  And he saw the drag queen story times and the pedophilia and just the evil of the Democrats.
[02:22:19.651 --> 02:22:21.432]  He's like, is it really real?
[02:22:21.432 --> 02:22:24.615]  See, a lot of people think, oh, this evil's coming out, it's winning.
[02:22:24.615 --> 02:22:25.816]  No, no, this is it throwing a fit.
[02:22:25.816 --> 02:22:27.337]  It had to be covert before.
[02:22:27.337 --> 02:22:28.258]  This is its temper tantrum.
[02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:37.052]  The fact that it's so out in the open, a lot of people that didn't believe in God before go, well, these people act exactly like demons.
[02:22:37.052 --> 02:22:42.853]  So you see it in the news, oh, Roger, so he gets a pardon, says he's a big Christian now.
[02:22:42.853 --> 02:22:47.294]  No, he got encouraged by this black pastor I know he's been friends with five years.
[02:22:47.294 --> 02:22:49.634]  They talk like almost every day.
[02:22:49.634 --> 02:22:51.015]  Roger just talks about him constantly.
[02:22:54.076 --> 02:22:56.598]  I would say it's a gay way because I'm in love with him.
[02:22:56.598 --> 02:22:57.739]  The guy's married, nice guy.
[02:22:57.739 --> 02:23:00.400]  But I mean, Roger really likes Christians.
[02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:07.806]  And just like Trump, Trump was brought up a Protestant, and you know, okay, God, yeah, but you know, I'm so confident I don't need all that.
[02:23:07.806 --> 02:23:10.728]  I mean, I've had private conversations with Trump now.
[02:23:10.728 --> 02:23:12.829]  He's got Jesus.
[02:23:12.829 --> 02:23:15.411]  He said like three years ago, he goes, I've grown a lot.
[02:23:15.411 --> 02:23:17.793]  He goes, and now I've seen a lot, and I need God.
[02:23:18.813 --> 02:23:27.156]  And Trump has told me personally, he said, when I'm in there with those hundred preachers laying their hands on me, he goes, I've not felt power like that at a rock concert, not at a Daytona 500.
[02:23:27.156 --> 02:23:28.576]  He used that example.
[02:23:28.576 --> 02:23:29.856]  He's been at that before.
[02:23:29.856 --> 02:23:31.937]  Not when I get, you know, my best golf score.
[02:23:31.937 --> 02:23:34.218]  He said, man, the energy of Christians.
[02:23:34.218 --> 02:23:40.680]  He sees, he's telling me over the phone, he goes, this is when he was president elect, he goes, I'm going to change that law where the IRS harasses the churches.
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:41.100]  And he did.
[02:23:42.489 --> 02:23:46.475]  And I said, sir, I'm not like one of those Pharisee Christians, you don't have to tell me you're a Christian.
[02:23:46.475 --> 02:23:50.902]  And he goes, no, no, no, I just want you to know, I know, I know it's real.
[02:23:50.902 --> 02:23:52.744]  The president told me that.
[02:23:52.744 --> 02:23:57.031]  So, this is a big revival.
[02:23:57.031 --> 02:23:58.052]  And if you study the Bible,
[02:23:59.346 --> 02:24:01.067]  You notice who really leads the fights?
[02:24:01.067 --> 02:24:06.111]  It's not ever the goody two-shoe Pharisee who's the priest up there telling you how good they are.
[02:24:06.111 --> 02:24:11.555]  It's Moses, you know, who was part of the system and, you know, and then later got in trouble for killing somebody.
[02:24:11.555 --> 02:24:16.578]  Or King David wants somebody's wife so bad he sends his best friend off to die because he's got to have her.
[02:24:16.578 --> 02:24:20.902]  And then later he's ready to kill himself and it is told, God judges his soul and goes, no, you are repented.
[02:24:21.522 --> 02:24:22.803]  You're a man after my own heart.
[02:24:22.803 --> 02:24:24.604]  God has these passions.
[02:24:24.604 --> 02:24:30.848]  God's omnipresent and pure and good, but God understands everything and weighs it.
[02:24:30.848 --> 02:24:37.913]  And so, people said, oh, is Roger Stone really taking Jesus as his personal savior?
[02:24:37.913 --> 02:24:40.475]  I'm not bragging, as I like to say.
[02:24:40.475 --> 02:24:45.558]  It's just giving you the truth that I've prayed with Roger.
[02:24:45.558 --> 02:24:46.679]  And he brought it up to me.
[02:24:49.721 --> 02:24:53.965]  And when I talk about God with him at dinner, in person, he would... I mean, he wasn't manipulating.
[02:24:53.965 --> 02:24:59.371]  He, at that age in his life, almost 70, and always been through, he now understands that.
[02:24:59.371 --> 02:25:01.753]  And that's a good thing.
[02:25:01.753 --> 02:25:03.315]  And we should celebrate that.
[02:25:03.315 --> 02:25:06.318]  And we should accept Roger.
[02:25:06.318 --> 02:25:09.241]  Who was never a hypocrite about going to gay pride parades.
[02:25:09.241 --> 02:25:10.382]  And who is a wild guy.
[02:25:12.383 --> 02:25:14.424]  But his wife's a Christian and she's been wild too.
[02:25:14.424 --> 02:25:14.985]  I've been wild.
[02:25:14.985 --> 02:25:17.086]  Nobody is judging anybody here.
[02:25:17.086 --> 02:25:18.307]  God judges the heart.
[02:25:18.307 --> 02:25:24.811]  And so I just welcome Roger publicly proclaiming his faith in Jesus Christ into that.
[02:25:24.811 --> 02:25:30.015]  And I think we should all welcome him because there are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:25:30.015 --> 02:25:36.999]  You come under satanic attack, buddy, you get Jesus or you bow to Satan and you get destroyed.
[02:25:36.999 --> 02:25:41.262]  There's nothing like having the devil on your ass to get you to get over to Jesus.
[02:25:41.262 --> 02:25:41.983]  And the minute
[02:25:43.464 --> 02:25:48.166]  They're doing all their evil stuff to you and persecuting you the minute you just call on Jesus in the middle of the night.
[02:25:48.166 --> 02:25:48.687]  For real.
[02:25:48.687 --> 02:25:52.709]  And don't just tell Jesus what to do or don't just say, Jesus, I need your help.
[02:25:52.709 --> 02:25:54.710]  That's when you're going to get Jesus.
[02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:56.671]  And folks, I'm not up here like some preacher, man.
[02:25:56.671 --> 02:25:57.571]  Let me tell you.
[02:25:57.571 --> 02:26:04.755]  I mean, I never bragged about it or all that kind of stuff, but I've had a few girlfriends and done a few things and beat people to death and things like that.
[02:26:04.755 --> 02:26:11.218]  I mean, I'm Mr. Worldly, but I'm telling you, Jesus is the only thing that's going to fix this.
[02:26:11.218 --> 02:26:11.898]  Period.
[02:26:11.898 --> 02:26:13.019]  Here's what Roger Stone had to say.
[02:26:14.497 --> 02:26:18.319]  The only fear I have is not being right with God.
[02:26:18.319 --> 02:26:19.540]  And where are you on that score?
[02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:20.500]  I feel pretty good.
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:25.123]  Because I've taken Jesus Christ as my personal savior.
[02:26:25.123 --> 02:26:27.745]  And it's given me enormous strength and solace.
[02:26:27.745 --> 02:26:30.906]  Because He knows what's in my heart.
[02:26:30.906 --> 02:26:33.148]  Boom!
[02:26:33.148 --> 02:26:35.109]  And I told Roger to do that publicly.
[02:26:36.665 --> 02:26:43.432]  Six months ago I said, Christ, when they hauled him off to be tortured and killed, people denied him.
[02:26:43.432 --> 02:26:44.633]  And others didn't.
[02:26:44.633 --> 02:26:50.878]  And that's the public endorsement of Christ is what Christ wants.
[02:26:51.792 --> 02:26:53.113]  Jesus Christ.
[02:26:53.113 --> 02:26:56.255]  These establishment churches won't even say his name, because the devil hates it.
[02:26:56.255 --> 02:26:58.097]  All right, our guest is with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:26:58.097 --> 02:27:00.219]  I appreciate her holding while I got into that.
[02:27:00.219 --> 02:27:01.159]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[02:27:01.159 --> 02:27:02.160]  It's Super Tuesday.
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:04.362]  Deanna Lorraine is amazing.
[02:27:04.362 --> 02:27:06.443]  She's super smart and a very beautiful woman.
[02:27:06.443 --> 02:27:08.345]  Chris Matthews got fired for saying our guest was beautiful.
[02:27:08.345 --> 02:27:10.006]  She's a very radiant, even in person.
[02:27:10.006 --> 02:27:10.787]  Wow.
[02:27:10.787 --> 02:27:12.208]  What a God's creations.
[02:27:12.208 --> 02:27:13.208]  We're very thankful for her.
[02:27:13.208 --> 02:27:18.873]  Drag queen story time with pedophiles is fine with kids, but just don't tell the woman she's beautiful.
[02:27:18.873 --> 02:27:20.214]  You're very beautiful as well.
[02:27:20.214 --> 02:27:21.515]  I'm not supposed to say that, so I'm going to say it.
[02:27:22.535 --> 02:27:25.136]  Deanna for Congress.com.
[02:27:25.136 --> 02:27:29.998]  We're going to go to break in about a minute and a half, but what are you going to cover when we come back?
[02:27:29.998 --> 02:27:31.679]  First of all, you can tell me beautiful.
[02:27:31.679 --> 02:27:34.320]  I'm beautiful all day long and I love it.
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:35.820]  It's not sexist.
[02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:37.001]  I just think it's amazing.
[02:27:37.001 --> 02:27:38.581]  So thank you for that.
[02:27:38.581 --> 02:27:51.026]  We're going to talk about, you know, what's going on with the elections right now and also my mobile billboard bus that has been driving around San Francisco, trolling Nancy Pelosi and all her failures and mistakes.
[02:27:51.522 --> 02:27:59.369]  We can talk about Drag Queen Story Hour, and we can talk about God, and bringing God and Christian values back to America, and anything else you want to talk about.
[02:27:59.369 --> 02:27:59.849]  Amazing.
[02:27:59.849 --> 02:28:01.670]  And again, you're running against Nancy Pelosi.
[02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:03.972]  Win, lose, or draw, it doesn't matter.
[02:28:03.972 --> 02:28:05.053]  You got in the arena.
[02:28:05.053 --> 02:28:07.175]  You have used the platform you've reached.
[02:28:07.175 --> 02:28:09.197]  Any idea how many people you've reached since you got in the arena?
[02:28:10.587 --> 02:28:12.350]  I honestly think it's millions.
[02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:15.334]  Honestly, on this show you reach millions.
[02:28:15.334 --> 02:28:16.235]  You're everywhere.
[02:28:16.235 --> 02:28:18.698]  I would say you've reached probably a billion people worldwide.
[02:28:18.698 --> 02:28:21.222]  I'd say you've probably reached a hundred million in the U.S.
[02:28:21.222 --> 02:28:24.506]  You have absolutely taken action.
[02:28:24.506 --> 02:28:26.910]  Absolutely, and people from other countries even.
[02:28:27.395 --> 02:28:28.255]  Are fans of me.
[02:28:28.255 --> 02:28:38.741]  You know, I've got people in Sweden or Canada, Great Britain that say that they want a mini Trump and mini Deanna Lorraine and they're very inspired and they want to take action too.
[02:28:38.741 --> 02:28:41.822]  So this isn't just a nationwide thing.
[02:28:41.822 --> 02:28:43.003]  This is international.
[02:28:43.003 --> 02:28:44.564]  It's a movement that we began.
[02:28:44.564 --> 02:28:45.964]  All right, stay there.
[02:28:45.964 --> 02:28:48.105]  Let's talk about that because that's the key.
[02:28:48.105 --> 02:28:50.006]  We're not just fighting in America.
[02:28:50.006 --> 02:28:51.327]  We're fighting world-wide.
[02:28:53.797 --> 02:28:58.359]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:58.359 --> 02:29:00.439]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:00.439 --> 02:29:02.180]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:08.722]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:08.722 --> 02:29:13.804]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:13.804 --> 02:29:18.506]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:18.946 --> 02:29:22.048]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:22.048 --> 02:29:29.072]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:29.072 --> 02:29:34.254]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:34.254 --> 02:29:37.556]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:37.556 --> 02:29:38.497]  Get clean.
[02:29:38.497 --> 02:29:40.338]  Call now and learn more.
[02:29:40.338 --> 02:29:40.378]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:48.401]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:48.401 --> 02:29:55.882]  That's 800-506-6740.
[02:29:55.882 --> 02:29:56.662]  Real stuff, man.
[02:29:56.662 --> 02:29:58.063]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[02:29:58.063 --> 02:30:03.303]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[02:30:03.303 --> 02:30:06.164]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[02:30:06.164 --> 02:30:07.884]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[02:30:07.884 --> 02:30:11.125]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[02:30:11.665 --> 02:30:15.528]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[02:30:15.528 --> 02:30:16.749]  20 different stickers.
[02:30:16.749 --> 02:30:18.390]  Impeach the Democrats.
[02:30:18.390 --> 02:30:19.450]  Save the Second Amendment.
[02:30:19.450 --> 02:30:20.551]  Defend the First Amendment.
[02:30:20.551 --> 02:30:21.872]  Infowars.com.
[02:30:21.872 --> 02:30:23.293]  And it looks like duct tape.
[02:30:23.293 --> 02:30:24.054]  It's just a regular sticker.
[02:30:24.054 --> 02:30:25.054]  You put it over your mouth.
[02:30:25.054 --> 02:30:26.375]  You go to a Trump rally.
[02:30:26.375 --> 02:30:28.817]  And you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[02:30:28.817 --> 02:30:30.398]  People say, why are you doing this?
[02:30:30.398 --> 02:30:30.938]  What's happening?
[02:30:30.938 --> 02:30:32.459]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[02:30:32.459 --> 02:30:34.701]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[02:30:34.701 --> 02:30:36.582]  And Dr. Pachinic, let me just ask you what you think.
[02:30:36.582 --> 02:30:37.823]  Because I've not launched this yet.
[02:30:38.063 --> 02:30:38.843]  Brilliant.
[02:30:38.843 --> 02:30:45.928]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[02:30:45.928 --> 02:30:48.890]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[02:30:48.890 --> 02:30:51.711]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[02:30:51.711 --> 02:30:52.392]  Silence.
[02:30:57.754 --> 02:30:59.395]  Owl Killer in New Jersey.
[02:30:59.395 --> 02:30:59.975]  You're on the air.
[02:30:59.975 --> 02:31:00.555]  Go ahead.
[02:31:00.555 --> 02:31:03.317]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[02:31:03.317 --> 02:31:06.398]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[02:31:06.398 --> 02:31:11.681]  So that Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste and that Super Blue Whitening Toothpaste is on another level.
[02:31:11.681 --> 02:31:15.002]  I use the Super Blue in the morning and then the whitening at night.
[02:31:15.002 --> 02:31:16.823]  And it absorbs into your gum.
[02:31:16.823 --> 02:31:19.665]  It is by far the best product that I've ever used in my life.
[02:31:19.665 --> 02:31:22.306]  I literally just took Turbo Force on my way to the gym right now.
[02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:30.589]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[02:31:30.589 --> 02:31:31.930]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[02:31:31.930 --> 02:31:32.870]  Support this man.
[02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:34.351]  Everything that he exposed.
[02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:35.772]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[02:31:35.772 --> 02:31:36.892]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[02:31:36.892 --> 02:31:38.193]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[02:31:38.193 --> 02:31:41.034]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[02:31:41.034 --> 02:31:42.694]  Go look it up yourself.
[02:31:42.694 --> 02:31:43.855]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[02:31:43.855 --> 02:31:45.055]  They definitely want us off the air.
[02:31:45.055 --> 02:31:45.976]  Without you, we're not here.
[02:31:45.976 --> 02:31:47.877]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[02:31:54.991 --> 02:32:00.534]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[02:32:00.534 --> 02:32:03.956]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[02:32:03.956 --> 02:32:04.516]  Yeah.
[02:32:04.516 --> 02:32:07.078]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man, I love women.
[02:32:07.078 --> 02:32:08.699]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[02:32:08.699 --> 02:32:10.079]  You may have problems with her.
[02:32:10.079 --> 02:32:11.340]  You may get a divorce.
[02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:11.960]  You may whatever.
[02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:16.703]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful and I loved.
[02:32:16.983 --> 02:32:30.918]  Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storable foods, we've got the best out there because I want you to get a great result and to come back again and again as a customer and fund our political, spiritual operations against the global system.
[02:32:30.918 --> 02:32:35.784]  So if you want storable foods and everybody else is sold out, and you want them delivered to your door, you want them to be high quality,
[02:32:36.124 --> 02:32:38.345]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:16.801 --> 02:33:20.564]  It's March 3rd, Tuesday, 2020.
[02:33:20.564 --> 02:33:24.207]  244 out from the election.
[02:33:24.207 --> 02:33:30.092]  Deanna Lorraine running against Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, is our guest.
[02:33:30.092 --> 02:33:41.000]  You know, I got sent this by Roger and by his personal lawyer, Tyler Nixon, a few days ago, and I never put it out.
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.943]  It's not violating Judge Jackson's order.
[02:33:45.293 --> 02:33:53.917]  But it's just simply Roger's message of victory and vengeance.
[02:33:53.917 --> 02:33:58.799]  The two Vs. Victory and vengeance.
[02:33:58.799 --> 02:34:05.683]  So that's Roger Stone's message there today.
[02:34:05.683 --> 02:34:10.485]  Again, I just have to be real with listeners.
[02:34:11.932 --> 02:34:13.193]  It's a problem I have now.
[02:34:13.193 --> 02:34:22.417]  20 years ago, I would like lovingly, dripping with, salivating, I would like, oh, look at the leftist, oh, they did this, and oh, look, they did that.
[02:34:22.417 --> 02:34:23.958]  Now it's so horrible.
[02:34:23.958 --> 02:34:27.039]  I look at it once, and then it's almost evil to put it on air.
[02:34:27.039 --> 02:34:31.581]  And I'm not covering stuff up, but I'm being honest with the listeners.
[02:34:31.581 --> 02:34:36.083]  I don't want to say the enemy's getting to me.
[02:34:36.083 --> 02:34:39.265]  I just, man, I don't want to look.
[02:34:40.677 --> 02:34:44.018]  It's like new videos of full-grown men humping little girls.
[02:34:44.018 --> 02:34:46.819]  Now at the Drag Queen Storytime, they like hump them.
[02:34:46.819 --> 02:34:53.441]  I mean, I just... Because the normal response is to go after those people.
[02:34:53.441 --> 02:34:55.161]  But I know we've got to expose it politically.
[02:34:55.161 --> 02:34:57.022]  So I've got to get some therapy or something.
[02:34:57.022 --> 02:34:58.222]  And I'm serious.
[02:34:58.222 --> 02:35:02.424]  Because they're doing this to burn us out and just make us give up.
[02:35:02.424 --> 02:35:05.745]  And quite frankly, at one level it is.
[02:35:05.745 --> 02:35:09.726]  Because I make myself look at this stuff
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:16.564]  And then I go out and I'm too pissed to paint with my children.
[02:35:16.564 --> 02:35:28.734]  So I've been praying to God every minute, literally, internally, like, show me the way to fight this and to expose it, but to not go... because you look in the abyss too long, you become a monster.
[02:35:28.734 --> 02:35:29.575]  You become the abyss.
[02:35:29.575 --> 02:35:31.176]  You fight monsters, you become... I mean, like...
[02:35:32.301 --> 02:35:33.162]  And that's their plan.
[02:35:33.162 --> 02:35:37.345]  They just think they put this green smoke out and it's just so evil.
[02:35:37.345 --> 02:35:39.447]  This is them openly showing who they are.
[02:35:39.447 --> 02:35:40.848]  Oh, we don't get control?
[02:35:40.848 --> 02:35:42.129]  Well, we're going to do this with your kids.
[02:35:42.129 --> 02:35:43.010]  Well, they don't have all the kids.
[02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:44.911]  They're just showing you kids they've captured.
[02:35:44.911 --> 02:35:46.453]  And you know what?
[02:35:46.453 --> 02:35:50.396]  The big, fat, ugly men in clown outfits, little girls crying when they rub themselves on them.
[02:35:50.396 --> 02:35:51.397]  That's bad enough.
[02:35:51.397 --> 02:35:59.904]  But when I watch the mothers rubbing their thighs together and weird men and the people in the background getting off on this pedophilic stuff, that's what hurts me.
[02:36:00.965 --> 02:36:02.426]  It's like, really?
[02:36:02.426 --> 02:36:07.609]  There's that many people that are gone.
[02:36:07.609 --> 02:36:13.873]  So, I know you want to talk about the campaign and all the things you're doing and the insanity of what's unfolding.
[02:36:13.873 --> 02:36:21.357]  Deanna Lorraine running for Congress against Pelosi and your predictions for Super Tuesday and what's coming.
[02:36:21.357 --> 02:36:24.279]  And if you don't win today, we'd love to try to get you to talk show host here on air.
[02:36:24.279 --> 02:36:26.661]  Let's get that officially out to you.
[02:36:26.661 --> 02:36:27.301]  We want to hire you.
[02:36:30.083 --> 02:36:30.964]  I feel sick to my stomach, Alex.
[02:36:30.964 --> 02:36:36.909]  It really makes me sick and it's disturbing that so many people are even okay with it.
[02:36:55.063 --> 02:37:03.168]  You know, that there is something called Drag Queen Story Hour that their parents are dragging their children to, three years old or four years old.
[02:37:03.168 --> 02:37:08.671]  And I've been to pride parades before to try to see, you know, maybe it's innocent.
[02:37:08.671 --> 02:37:12.033]  You know, maybe I'll just believe what they say and it's all innocent.
[02:37:12.033 --> 02:37:21.218]  But no, it's not innocent because these people are, you know, dragging their three-year-olds wearing rainbow pride gear and it's pedophilic, you know?
[02:37:21.218 --> 02:37:24.180]  And then we've got these five-year-old kids dancing.
[02:37:25.332 --> 02:37:26.733]  It's showing their butts and everything.
[02:37:26.733 --> 02:37:27.793]  This is not okay.
[02:37:27.793 --> 02:37:29.313]  It's straight up pedophilia.
[02:37:29.313 --> 02:37:32.054]  It's out in the open, and it's sickening.
[02:37:32.054 --> 02:37:33.614]  So, what are we going to do about it?
[02:37:33.614 --> 02:37:35.835]  I mean, I get really sick about it.
[02:37:35.835 --> 02:37:44.817]  I personally would pass what I call the Protect America's Children Act, and you can check that out on my platform at DeannaForCongress.com.
[02:37:44.817 --> 02:37:50.239]  The Protect America's Children Act would try to remove completely or at least heavily reduce
[02:37:51.079 --> 02:37:57.802]  The pedophilic, the gender, the sex, the abortion type of curriculum in our schools.
[02:37:57.802 --> 02:37:59.623]  Because it's so widespread.
[02:37:59.623 --> 02:38:00.723]  And at the very least... And that's beautiful.
[02:38:00.723 --> 02:38:02.964]  Whether you win or not, Congress needs to take that up.
[02:38:02.964 --> 02:38:04.705]  Here's an article on Infowars.com.
[02:38:04.705 --> 02:38:05.846]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:38:05.846 --> 02:38:11.488]  School in Brooklyn hands out drag queen and training stickers to four-year-olds without parent consent.
[02:38:11.488 --> 02:38:13.929]  This is perverts coming after your kids.
[02:38:13.929 --> 02:38:15.670]  Good God!
[02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:17.111]  No more perverts!
[02:38:17.111 --> 02:38:19.512]  As Trump said, no more perverts in office.
[02:38:20.086 --> 02:38:22.850]  We can't have any more purpose and it's sick and it's normalizing.
[02:38:22.850 --> 02:38:24.332]  That's the worst thing about it, Alex.
[02:38:24.332 --> 02:38:28.819]  These kids are walking around encouraged to try on a different gender.
[02:38:28.819 --> 02:38:32.844]  Encouraged, you know, and they're having mastectomies at age 10 or 15.
[02:38:32.844 --> 02:38:35.989]  These boys, these girls are cutting off their breasts.
[02:38:36.269 --> 02:38:37.169]  They're healthy breasts.
[02:38:37.169 --> 02:38:40.430]  These boys are wanting to be women at 15 years old.
[02:38:40.430 --> 02:38:42.070]  It's disgusting and it's so scary.
[02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:43.950]  We're robbing them of their childhood.
[02:38:43.950 --> 02:38:46.391]  What happened to preserving children's innocence?
[02:38:46.391 --> 02:38:47.471]  What happened to that?
[02:38:47.471 --> 02:38:52.652]  There's nothing wrong with- We have humans, a lot of them are convicted pedophiles, literally wanting to feed on our children.
[02:38:52.652 --> 02:38:55.493]  And they're just launching their full attack.
[02:38:55.493 --> 02:38:57.113]  Let me ask you this.
[02:38:57.113 --> 02:39:02.754]  Looking at Joe Biden, I'm sure you saw the video, he's endorsed Beto to be a national gun czar to confiscate all guns.
[02:39:02.754 --> 02:39:03.354]  Did you see that video?
[02:39:06.054 --> 02:39:09.356]  What the hell is that?
[02:39:09.356 --> 02:39:12.678]  You know, people want socialism, right?
[02:39:12.678 --> 02:39:14.339]  They want to confiscate our guns.
[02:39:14.339 --> 02:39:15.660]  They want to get rid of our guns.
[02:39:15.660 --> 02:39:18.101]  They want to leave us defenseless.
[02:39:18.101 --> 02:39:20.923]  And they want us to be totally okay with it.
[02:39:20.923 --> 02:39:23.044]  I mean, look at Beto and Biden.
[02:39:23.044 --> 02:39:25.846]  I mean, they're such a cute little couple there.
[02:39:28.582 --> 02:39:31.464]  But, can you imagine one of them being Commander-in-Chief?
[02:39:31.464 --> 02:39:34.487]  I mean, that's frightening to think of one of those being Commander-in-Chief.
[02:39:34.487 --> 02:39:37.129]  I don't believe the country of Beto was President or Biden.
[02:39:37.129 --> 02:39:47.558]  And the thing is, is it emblematic for you that Biden literally is degenerating every day, can barely talk, and thinks that Super Thursday is when the election is, and that they keep him up there?
[02:39:47.558 --> 02:39:48.439]  What are they thinking?
[02:39:50.546 --> 02:39:51.968]  I don't know what they're thinking, honestly.
[02:39:51.968 --> 02:40:05.545]  I think it's helpful for people like you and I. It's actually really helpful to get to our campaign that they're keeping these senile, incoherent people up there talking about corn pop, talking about kids grabbing onto his hairy legs in the pool.
[02:40:06.085 --> 02:40:09.006]  You know, I mean, what is that?
[02:40:09.006 --> 02:40:12.307]  But it's a gift to my campaign, it's a gift to people like Trump.
[02:40:12.307 --> 02:40:16.288]  We need to keep them talking, we need to keep them having their mouthpieces out there.
[02:40:16.288 --> 02:40:23.891]  Deanna, you're a gift to America and the world, and I'm going to mail you a $50 external mic, because your voice is incredible in person, but you always use internal mics.
[02:40:23.891 --> 02:40:26.071]  But let's play a clip of what I just mentioned.
[02:40:26.071 --> 02:40:27.232]  Here is last night.
[02:40:28.257 --> 02:40:29.458]  I want to make something clear!
[02:40:56.044 --> 02:40:59.586]  I'm going to guarantee you this is not last year's scene of this guy.
[02:40:59.586 --> 02:41:01.987]  You're going to take care of the gun problem with me.
[02:41:01.987 --> 02:41:04.269]  You're going to be the one who leads this effort.
[02:41:04.269 --> 02:41:05.449]  I'm counting on you.
[02:41:05.449 --> 02:41:07.451]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[02:41:07.451 --> 02:41:08.331]  You're the good guy.
[02:41:08.331 --> 02:41:09.772]  No, no.
[02:41:09.772 --> 02:41:15.735]  And I don't want to make fun of people that have had brain injuries, but I mean, we all know him.
[02:41:15.735 --> 02:41:18.557]  Biden is literally in dementia.
[02:41:18.557 --> 02:41:22.739]  The Democrats have someone with dementia stumbling around like an undead.
[02:41:22.739 --> 02:41:23.360]  Where does this go?
[02:41:25.188 --> 02:41:31.569]  Well, again, it's helpful to us because they keep on getting more and more dementia, and at the same time, we get stronger.
[02:41:31.569 --> 02:41:36.650]  You know, someone like me, who's very, uh, a strong advocate with a strong voice... Yes, I would say you're the opposite.
[02:41:36.650 --> 02:41:40.051]  You're glowing and well-spoken, and Biden is rotting.
[02:41:40.051 --> 02:41:41.832]  Yeah, and so is Nancy Pelosi, by the way.
[02:41:41.832 --> 02:41:42.712]  They're all rotting.
[02:41:42.712 --> 02:41:43.992]  Oh, let's talk about her!
[02:41:43.992 --> 02:41:45.272]  I know folks that know her personally.
[02:41:45.272 --> 02:41:48.713]  They say up close, I'm not being mean, that she literally is frightening.
[02:41:49.918 --> 02:41:52.359]  I think it speaks to their demonic tendencies, right?
[02:41:52.359 --> 02:41:54.739]  The demon is inside these people.
[02:41:54.739 --> 02:41:55.459]  It's satanic.
[02:41:55.459 --> 02:42:00.821]  These people are ugly on the inside, and they're ugly on the outside, and they're not aging very well.
[02:42:00.821 --> 02:42:06.422]  But Alex, when you have God within you, working through you, you become more beautiful.
[02:42:06.422 --> 02:42:08.142]  You become more glowing.
[02:42:08.142 --> 02:42:09.243]  And I think that really speaks to that.
[02:42:09.243 --> 02:42:10.003]  Oh, believe me, I've experienced it.
[02:42:10.003 --> 02:42:10.723]  You're absolutely right.
[02:42:11.323 --> 02:42:16.286]  I've been in churches growing up that weren't fake, like the people were glowing when they were praising God.
[02:42:16.286 --> 02:42:18.006]  I remember being a little kid going, what the?
[02:42:18.006 --> 02:42:20.908]  Like I saw women that were like just glowing like angels.
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:23.601]  It's like the fountain of youth, Alex.
[02:42:23.601 --> 02:42:27.384]  You know, and I think that's the fountain of youth, is having God work through you.
[02:42:27.384 --> 02:42:28.465]  And that's how I think.
[02:42:28.465 --> 02:42:31.447]  I only speak the truth, and truth is from God.
[02:42:31.447 --> 02:42:36.992]  I don't do it, you know, I think... By the way, major studies show that Christians and people live longer.
[02:42:36.992 --> 02:42:38.653]  I mean, it literally is the fountain of youth.
[02:42:38.653 --> 02:42:41.835]  You can energize yourselves with Christ.
[02:42:41.835 --> 02:42:44.477]  Folks, I'm not here harping on Christ all day.
[02:42:44.477 --> 02:42:46.719]  It's all, it's everything.
[02:42:46.719 --> 02:42:48.440]  I mean, I've gone through the darkness.
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:50.362]  It's only Christ.
[02:42:50.362 --> 02:42:51.122]  It's only Christ.
[02:42:51.122 --> 02:42:51.603]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.984 --> 02:43:00.187]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[02:43:00.187 --> 02:43:04.489]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[02:43:04.489 --> 02:43:08.931]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[02:43:08.931 --> 02:43:17.335]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[02:43:17.335 --> 02:43:24.558]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[02:43:24.978 --> 02:43:28.581]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[02:43:28.581 --> 02:43:33.904]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[02:43:33.904 --> 02:43:41.970]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.

[02:43:53.760 --> 02:44:01.945]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness, and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[02:44:01.945 --> 02:44:02.505]  That's good.
[02:44:02.505 --> 02:44:04.907]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[02:44:04.907 --> 02:44:11.891]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[02:44:11.891 --> 02:44:15.553]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[02:44:15.553 --> 02:44:22.558]  And that means, even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[02:44:23.138 --> 02:44:28.342]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[02:44:28.342 --> 02:44:36.627]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[02:44:36.627 --> 02:44:46.033]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra 12, and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.

[02:44:54.239 --> 02:44:55.020]  Everybody needs food.
[02:44:55.020 --> 02:44:56.561]  I'm proud we're selling high quality food.
[02:44:56.561 --> 02:44:59.384]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble.
[02:44:59.384 --> 02:45:01.846]  This is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[02:45:01.846 --> 02:45:06.410]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food.
[02:45:06.410 --> 02:45:11.755]  And I had long discussions this morning, over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this.
[02:45:11.755 --> 02:45:14.698]  Right now the folks running the plants to get the best idea we have.
[02:45:14.838 --> 02:45:15.058]  We're good.
[02:45:39.701 --> 02:45:40.762]  I always promote DNA Force Plus.
[02:45:58.524 --> 02:45:58.564]  No.
[02:46:20.828 --> 02:46:23.631]  Powerful, total booster in your whole life.
[02:46:23.631 --> 02:46:26.513]  Not just for immunity, but for libido, stamina, you name it.
[02:46:26.513 --> 02:46:29.656]  And you need to boost your immunity at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:29.656 --> 02:46:36.862]  With bodies, with DNA Force Plus, with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, with Ultra 12 that's back in stock, and Turbo Force, by the way, just came back into stock.
[02:46:36.862 --> 02:46:38.063]  It just boosts everything.
[02:46:38.063 --> 02:46:39.324]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:39.324 --> 02:46:40.365]  You fund the Info War.
[02:46:40.365 --> 02:46:41.947]  You fund the rebellion against the globalists.
[02:46:41.947 --> 02:46:44.569]  You get great prices and you boost your immune system.
[02:46:44.569 --> 02:46:45.650]  A total 360 win.
[02:46:45.650 --> 02:46:46.250]  Take action.
[02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:47.792]  InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:46:48.172 --> 02:46:49.573]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:17.208 --> 02:47:21.389]  Welcome to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:47:21.389 --> 02:47:25.511]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:25.511 --> 02:47:40.875]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars Sponsor and InfoWarsStore.com has high quality, storable food at the lowest price you're going to find.
[02:47:40.875 --> 02:47:46.377]  They've not raised prices yet, but they're up to 5, 6, 7, 8 weeks for delivery depending on the item.
[02:47:47.341 --> 02:47:50.504]  They're under-promising, over-delivering.
[02:47:50.504 --> 02:47:52.506]  But everybody else has been sold out for a month.
[02:47:52.506 --> 02:47:54.627]  We told you about the FEMA emergency first.
[02:47:54.627 --> 02:47:56.469]  We told you about the cover-up first.
[02:47:56.469 --> 02:48:05.397]  Whether this virus is super deadly or not, they're using the crisis that has come with it to take over and have power and control.
[02:48:05.397 --> 02:48:07.519]  Trump is not trying to do that.
[02:48:09.855 --> 02:48:16.959]  But there's no doubt that everyone I talk to, including myself, I'm not trying to cough here on air to illustrate this.
[02:48:16.959 --> 02:48:17.799]  I can't stop.
[02:48:17.799 --> 02:48:20.221]  I talked to Tyler Nixon during the break, Rodgers' lawyer.
[02:48:20.221 --> 02:48:21.301]  He hasn't been sick in years.
[02:48:21.301 --> 02:48:23.042]  He has pneumonia.
[02:48:23.042 --> 02:48:24.503]  He's super sick right now.
[02:48:24.503 --> 02:48:26.464]  Flew back from D.C.
[02:48:26.464 --> 02:48:29.786]  Everybody I know that's flown is super sick.
[02:48:29.786 --> 02:48:31.026]  That's what Steve McShannock said a month ago.
[02:48:31.026 --> 02:48:32.587]  He said it's already all over the U.S.
[02:48:32.587 --> 02:48:34.508]  That's confirmed now.
[02:48:34.508 --> 02:48:35.489]  It's race-specific, though.
[02:48:35.489 --> 02:48:36.449]  It mainly kills Asians.
[02:48:36.449 --> 02:48:37.530]  Well, that's still a problem.
[02:48:37.530 --> 02:48:38.150]  It's still sad.
[02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:38.811]  We care about them.
[02:48:39.707 --> 02:48:42.188]  But it's the globalist launching this.
[02:48:42.188 --> 02:48:43.908]  It's man-made right now.
[02:48:43.908 --> 02:48:45.669]  That's why you've got to be concerned.
[02:48:45.669 --> 02:48:49.490]  So check that checklist off to get high-quality storable food.
[02:48:49.490 --> 02:48:56.732]  The only place you're going to get it at five times less than store cost, because they mark it up, is InfoWareStore.com.
[02:48:56.732 --> 02:49:01.594]  And if I lied to you and said, oh, it's seven days delivery, we'd have five times the orders, but I won't do it.
[02:49:02.574 --> 02:49:04.356]  The truth is, it's about four-week delivery, they told me.
[02:49:04.356 --> 02:49:11.162]  They said, don't say that on air because people get mad, but most of our stuff's four weeks, but some of it's six, seven weeks with specialty items, so don't tell them that.
[02:49:11.162 --> 02:49:11.702]  Well, you know what?
[02:49:11.702 --> 02:49:12.223]  I'm gonna tell you.
[02:49:13.314 --> 02:49:16.795]  On the corporate contract, six to eight weeks, InfoWareStore.com.
[02:49:16.795 --> 02:49:19.936]  We've got all the other great items, DNA Force Plus, X2.
[02:49:19.936 --> 02:49:24.117]  Boosting your immune system is just as important as having storable foods.
[02:49:24.117 --> 02:49:27.297]  For economic collapse, for war, for whatever, it lasts 25 years.
[02:49:27.297 --> 02:49:30.518]  With inflation, you buy it, it locks in the cost, save money that way.
[02:49:30.518 --> 02:49:32.739]  It's a great investment and it funds the InfoWare.
[02:49:32.739 --> 02:49:35.359]  Take action, InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:35.359 --> 02:49:42.461]  Paul Watson's about to take over, but Deanna Lorraine running for Congress against Nancy Pelosi.
[02:49:44.397 --> 02:49:48.684]  You're a winner any way you slice this in a rigged district like that.
[02:49:48.684 --> 02:49:51.950]  And you've gone through a lot in your fight against her.
[02:49:51.950 --> 02:49:53.492]  What do you expect to see tonight?
[02:49:53.492 --> 02:49:54.935]  And what do you expect to see in the future?
[02:49:54.935 --> 02:49:57.960]  Because we know her expiration date like Joe Biden's up.
[02:49:59.824 --> 02:50:01.324]  No, there's a lot.
[02:50:01.324 --> 02:50:05.805]  There's going to be a lot of funny business, I think, going on with ballot harvesting.
[02:50:05.805 --> 02:50:08.406]  And, you know, I think the election is a bit rich.
[02:50:08.406 --> 02:50:11.086]  But I do hope to see a miracle.
[02:50:11.086 --> 02:50:19.448]  You know, I hope to see some unexpected, surprising results tonight with a lot of people voting.
[02:50:19.448 --> 02:50:19.748]  All right.
[02:50:19.748 --> 02:50:22.729]  Well, her Skype's a little hammered and it's broken up right now.
[02:50:22.729 --> 02:50:23.649]  We'll see if that reconnects.
[02:50:23.649 --> 02:50:25.350]  The miracle of Skype.
[02:50:25.350 --> 02:50:26.650]  I would just tell everyone using Skype.
[02:50:27.628 --> 02:50:29.889]  Go to Radio Shack's out of business.
[02:50:29.889 --> 02:50:30.590]  Go online.
[02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:31.190]  Go wherever.
[02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:32.991]  Hell, we ought to sell them.
[02:50:32.991 --> 02:50:34.032]  Get a $20 mic.
[02:50:34.032 --> 02:50:34.792]  External.
[02:50:34.792 --> 02:50:35.092]  Or a $50.
[02:50:35.092 --> 02:50:37.114]  The $50 ones are amazing.
[02:50:37.114 --> 02:50:40.416]  In fact, I would almost say this is like $300, $400 mic.
[02:50:40.416 --> 02:50:40.896]  Whatever, it's $500.
[02:50:40.896 --> 02:50:42.137]  I don't know what this costs.
[02:50:42.137 --> 02:50:43.577]  It's Electro Voice.
[02:50:43.577 --> 02:50:46.019]  That a little cheap $50 mic is better.
[02:50:46.019 --> 02:50:47.059]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:50:47.059 --> 02:50:49.301]  It's like iPhone mics are so good now.
[02:50:50.194 --> 02:51:01.080]  That the recordings I do in my house on my phone sound better than an expensive microphone and a $3,000 tube amplifier in there.
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:03.681]  It's just incredible what technology has done.
[02:51:03.681 --> 02:51:08.864]  In fact, we're looking, and I may just go to like a little $50 mic in here because it's just going to be better.
[02:51:08.864 --> 02:51:09.565]  Anyways.
[02:51:10.796 --> 02:51:11.336]  We've lost her.
[02:51:11.336 --> 02:51:12.957]  We hope she wins tonight.
[02:51:12.957 --> 02:51:16.879]  But regardless, she won by taking action in this political campaign.
[02:51:16.879 --> 02:51:18.059]  We really appreciate her.
[02:51:18.059 --> 02:51:21.581]  Deanna Lorraine for Congress.
[02:51:21.581 --> 02:51:23.422]  Deanna4Congress.com.
[02:51:23.422 --> 02:51:26.203]  Okay.
[02:51:26.203 --> 02:51:28.484]  Oh, she's back now.
[02:51:28.484 --> 02:51:29.725]  Let's get her to say bye to us.
[02:51:29.725 --> 02:51:31.045]  So what are you expecting tonight?
[02:51:31.045 --> 02:51:32.246]  Where are you going from here, Deanna?
[02:51:43.505 --> 02:51:48.186]  Listen, your mic's out, but we love you.
[02:51:48.186 --> 02:51:50.947]  If you can get an external mic down the street, come back on the war room.
[02:51:50.947 --> 02:51:52.147]  Owen Shorter coming up.
[02:51:52.147 --> 02:51:52.927]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:52.927 --> 02:51:53.787]  Yeah, it's not a big deal.
[02:51:53.787 --> 02:51:54.228]  We're not mad.
[02:51:54.228 --> 02:51:56.368]  There's political or technical problems.
[02:51:56.368 --> 02:51:57.969]  That happens.
[02:51:57.969 --> 02:52:00.829]  It sounds like she's sending us a transmission from Pluto right now.
[02:52:00.829 --> 02:52:02.170]  So I'm going to stick a fork in it.
[02:52:02.170 --> 02:52:03.550]  We're done at that point.
[02:52:03.550 --> 02:52:03.850]  Okay.
[02:52:15.185 --> 02:52:21.687]  I've seen three videos the last week of, because this is all mapped out, whether it's Europe or here, it's the same plan.
[02:52:21.687 --> 02:52:26.549]  They're now humping the children at Drag Queen Storytime.
[02:52:26.549 --> 02:52:37.132]  We saw it a few months ago, six months ago, but now it's like, they're going to be porking them soon, okay?
[02:52:37.132 --> 02:52:40.633]  And, you know, I've got so many articles here that I could cover in so many videos, but
[02:52:41.932 --> 02:52:47.554]  I really just have to keep announcing they're trying to have sex with our children.
[02:52:47.554 --> 02:52:48.555]  But let me just do this.
[02:52:48.555 --> 02:52:51.236]  Let me just behave myself.
[02:52:51.236 --> 02:52:58.059]  And the last time we have here before Paul Watson takes over, let me just read you headlines.
[02:52:58.059 --> 02:53:01.200]  I actually read these articles, a lot of them.
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:03.401]  Probably 10% of these articles I read the whole thing.
[02:53:03.401 --> 02:53:05.081]  The rest I scan over.
[02:53:05.081 --> 02:53:05.782]  Let me just do this.
[02:53:08.939 --> 02:53:11.061]  That's probably the best thing I can do here.
[02:53:11.061 --> 02:53:13.102]  The time we have left.
[02:53:13.102 --> 02:53:23.490]  Scientific study claims liberals are having fewer male babies because... And they say we're aborting males because they're bad.
[02:53:23.490 --> 02:53:24.911]  China says abort the girls.
[02:53:24.911 --> 02:53:29.715]  Boys or girls, don't... As if a male is bad because he's a male.
[02:53:29.715 --> 02:53:31.757]  That is so beyond racist.
[02:53:31.757 --> 02:53:33.498]  It's just like aliens did this.
[02:53:33.498 --> 02:53:35.760]  See, I said I'd just read headlines.
[02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:38.202]  I could talk a whole show about this study.
[02:53:42.608 --> 02:53:43.870]  I'm not a victim.
[02:53:43.870 --> 02:53:46.916]  You talk about PTSD, man.
[02:53:46.916 --> 02:53:47.718]  Watching this?
[02:53:49.068 --> 02:53:55.271]  And mother's going, I love my daughter, would have had a whole great life, but I, it was a two-day abortion.
[02:53:55.271 --> 02:53:58.032]  They put chemicals and the baby fought for its life.
[02:53:58.032 --> 02:54:01.493]  And I felt so powerful when it died and finally stopped kicking.
[02:54:01.493 --> 02:54:06.675]  And you're like, what the fricking, what the hell?
[02:54:06.675 --> 02:54:10.637]  Hellraiser movies aren't like a demon going, and the baby fought for its life.
[02:54:10.637 --> 02:54:14.939]  And then I, and it's Democrats, it's liberals, they're demons!
[02:54:23.246 --> 02:54:24.767]  Sorry, that's just one article.
[02:54:24.767 --> 02:54:25.548]  Look at all these.
[02:54:25.548 --> 02:54:27.729]  I've probably got 500 articles right here.
[02:54:27.729 --> 02:54:32.192]  They're all just as sick and insane, and it's what they're doing to everybody right now.
[02:54:39.801 --> 02:54:41.021]  On purpose.
[02:54:41.021 --> 02:54:45.683]  Vegan demands neighbors, and governments doing this, not cook meat because it smells bad.
[02:54:45.683 --> 02:54:50.524]  How about we don't smell your stinking death, you stinking scum?
[02:54:50.524 --> 02:54:54.625]  Watch, homeowner repels thieves with motion-activated water sprinkler.
[02:54:54.625 --> 02:54:58.006]  That was a fun one I'll never have time to get to.
[02:54:58.006 --> 02:55:01.067]  Putin puts out a doctrine I agree with.
[02:55:01.067 --> 02:55:06.549]  Seeks to create conditions so that nobody wants to fight us.
[02:55:06.549 --> 02:55:07.789]  Hope for peace, prepare for war.
[02:55:10.623 --> 02:55:15.447]  Coronavirus Inc, Shep Gorka, and the CPAC Thought Police.
[02:55:15.447 --> 02:55:20.671]  I never got into the gay will.
[02:55:20.671 --> 02:55:29.518]  Gorka, I mean, the guy said nothing, but he's a great museum piece of an empty flathag.
[02:55:29.518 --> 02:55:30.058]  Top U.S.
[02:55:30.058 --> 02:55:33.581]  doctors says coronavirus now an outbreak, possibly a pandemic.
[02:55:33.581 --> 02:55:33.841]  U.S.
[02:55:33.841 --> 02:55:37.424]  orders cap on Chinese state media personnel because they're really spies in the U.S.
[02:55:39.258 --> 02:55:44.543]  Approximately 15 Sacramento County election staff did not work Tuesday due to coronavirus concern.
[02:55:44.543 --> 02:55:45.924]  It's already affecting the election.
[02:55:45.924 --> 02:55:54.271]  Democrat councilwoman shows support for leftists wanting to intentionally spread coronavirus to kill Trump supporters.
[02:55:54.271 --> 02:55:56.893]  They say if you get it, go to their events and spread it.
[02:55:56.893 --> 02:56:01.017]  And hell, California last year legalized if you have HIV, spreading it or hepatitis.
[02:56:03.311 --> 02:56:06.593]  Now they gotta build legalized pedophilia.
[02:56:06.593 --> 02:56:08.333]  He'll probably pass too.
[02:56:08.333 --> 02:56:10.794]  Look at that whacked out woman.
[02:56:10.794 --> 02:56:14.536]  With that crazy evil look in her eyes.
[02:56:14.536 --> 02:56:17.457]  Who believes like being evil is powerful.
[02:56:17.457 --> 02:56:20.219]  Lady, you're walking into a whole nother world.
[02:56:21.308 --> 02:56:25.011]  You want to get rid of chivalry as a woman and you're going to be a bioweapon?
[02:56:25.011 --> 02:56:27.393]  I mean, you know what really will happen to you, Cupcake?
[02:56:27.393 --> 02:56:32.237]  You ever actually spread coronavirus in public, you're going to get locked up in a Supermax prison for the rest of your life.
[02:56:32.237 --> 02:56:39.303]  And I don't take pleasure in that, but that's where demons go.
[02:56:39.303 --> 02:56:42.485]  They're just flirting with, they say, poking the bear.
[02:56:42.485 --> 02:56:43.666]  Poking the bear.
[02:56:43.666 --> 02:56:45.848]  Poking, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke.
[02:56:45.848 --> 02:56:47.850]  It's like, oh, why'd you do that to me?
[02:56:48.806 --> 02:56:54.253]  It's like Black Lives Matter goes to some black council member's home and starts threatening him and banging on his door.
[02:56:54.253 --> 02:56:55.474]  He comes up with a gun and says, get off my porch.
[02:56:55.474 --> 02:56:58.959]  They go, we're black!
[02:56:58.959 --> 02:57:02.283]  He's like, get off my porch at 2am!
[02:57:02.283 --> 02:57:03.684]  Stop threatening me!
[02:57:03.684 --> 02:57:04.566]  That's what Senator
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:07.721]  Leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, showed up.
[02:57:07.721 --> 02:57:12.322]  People were like, we're going to stab you, we're going to kill you, we're going to burn your house down.
[02:57:12.322 --> 02:57:13.963]  Mitch McConnell stayed inside.
[02:57:13.963 --> 02:57:15.704]  This dude came out and said, I'll shoot your ass.
[02:57:15.704 --> 02:57:20.326]  And they left.
[02:57:20.326 --> 02:57:22.907]  I mean, what the hell, man?
[02:57:22.907 --> 02:57:24.567]  You want to rape our kids?
[02:57:24.567 --> 02:57:26.908]  We'll break your ribs.
[02:57:26.908 --> 02:57:30.650]  I guarantee you, if Tommy Robinson, and I'm not saying he should have heard that, wouldn't have just beat the guy up.
[02:57:30.650 --> 02:57:32.111]  He would have bashed that guy's brains out.
[02:57:32.111 --> 02:57:32.691]  They'd have dropped it.
[02:57:34.301 --> 02:57:49.210]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:58:45.618 --> 02:58:48.078]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[02:58:48.078 --> 02:58:55.080]  Humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world.
[02:58:55.080 --> 02:58:56.960]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[02:58:56.960 --> 02:59:12.103]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant Cloward and Piven program.
[02:59:12.583 --> 02:59:13.123]  The U.N.
[02:59:13.123 --> 02:59:18.107]  also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government.
[02:59:42.483 --> 02:59:47.748]  You are our only hope.
[02:59:47.748 --> 02:59:55.975]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:55.975 --> 03:00:01.580]  All Joseph Watson's suiting up that nobody's ever seen is Empty Chair.
[03:00:10.655 --> 03:00:13.637]  I mailed to him more than 10 years ago.
[03:00:13.637 --> 03:00:16.819]  The first one never got to him, so I mailed him another.
[03:00:16.819 --> 03:00:22.763]  And there is the behind-the-scenes, the fabled lore that only you now are seeing.
[03:00:22.763 --> 03:00:26.185]  I got a map, Paul!
[03:00:26.185 --> 03:00:36.352]  But you heard Deanna Lorraine earlier talk about how she's running for Congress against Nancy Pelosi, how she's getting all this praise
[03:00:38.069 --> 03:00:39.029]  From around the world.
[03:00:39.029 --> 03:00:40.830]  But it's not about, oh, I'm getting praise.
[03:00:40.830 --> 03:00:43.351]  She's getting love.
[03:00:43.351 --> 03:00:44.772]  And she's getting love from me.
[03:00:44.772 --> 03:00:48.894]  Not because she's an attractive woman, because she's taking action as a soldier for freedom and truth.
[03:00:48.894 --> 03:00:53.276]  In fact, she's an attractive woman, there's just gravy on top.
[03:00:53.276 --> 03:01:00.299]  So, and I say that on purpose, because Chris Matthews told guests they weren't attractive, so he's gone.
[03:01:00.299 --> 03:01:04.621]  So you can drag Queen Storytime kids and have pedophilia talk, but don't tell a woman she's attractive.
[03:01:06.465 --> 03:01:09.026]  And man, the way he cucked out at the end and apologized.
[03:01:09.026 --> 03:01:13.108]  Talk about disgusting.
[03:01:13.108 --> 03:01:19.990]  But Gillette lost $8 billion when they ran ads showing a guy with a woman in a movie theater.
[03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:22.151]  And he wants to, he sees the woman, he goes, I like her.
[03:01:22.151 --> 03:01:25.072]  And he goes to say, hey, I like it.
[03:01:25.072 --> 03:01:26.453]  And the guy goes, whoa, that's rape.
[03:01:26.453 --> 03:01:27.913]  You don't talk to women.
[03:01:27.913 --> 03:01:29.694]  Men, you don't talk to women.
[03:01:29.694 --> 03:01:32.635]  But if you're a big, fat, convicted pedophile,
[03:01:34.841 --> 03:01:39.462]  That raped an eight-year-old like in Houston, or the other guy running it, a seven-year-old in Houston.
[03:01:39.462 --> 03:01:43.644]  Well then, horsey time!
[03:01:43.644 --> 03:01:46.405]  Time to ride horsey.
[03:01:46.405 --> 03:01:49.666]  And again, I harp on that because we first told you about it four years ago.
[03:01:49.666 --> 03:01:50.846]  You're like, why are you obsessing on this?
[03:01:50.846 --> 03:01:52.106]  Now it's everywhere.
[03:01:52.106 --> 03:01:53.227]  All over the news.
[03:01:53.227 --> 03:01:59.949]  Submit, submit to men in clown outfits with your children riding their erections through their pants.
[03:02:01.363 --> 03:02:02.603]  And the Boy Scouts is bankrupt.
[03:02:02.603 --> 03:02:10.787]  I remember like five years ago, the Boy Scouts are handing out condoms to seven-year-olds.
[03:02:10.787 --> 03:02:14.668]  And now they're bankrupt because it was a giant pedophile orgy.
[03:02:14.668 --> 03:02:16.729]  This is the takeover.
[03:02:16.729 --> 03:02:19.250]  Satan wants the innocence.
[03:02:19.250 --> 03:02:25.813]  Because if a child's able to grow up and be through decent people, that child 99% of the time is going to join Christ.
[03:02:25.813 --> 03:02:26.853]  It's like the screw tape letters.
[03:02:29.235 --> 03:02:36.902]  But if you can get them while they're young, you can twist them and put them into the cult.
[03:02:36.902 --> 03:02:41.486]  Because the first person that they ever had intimacy with was some fat dude.
[03:02:43.342 --> 03:02:46.603]  And they have all these articles and books they teach in the U.S.
[03:02:46.603 --> 03:02:47.203]  and Australia.
[03:02:47.203 --> 03:02:52.665]  An Obama official wrote one where it's about little kids and men having sex with them.
[03:02:52.665 --> 03:02:53.746]  Seven, eight, nine year olds.
[03:02:53.746 --> 03:02:55.826]  How great it is they make kids read this.
[03:02:55.826 --> 03:03:01.248]  I mean, the fact that we've put up with this is just unbelievable.
[03:03:01.248 --> 03:03:06.230]  Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over.
[03:03:06.230 --> 03:03:08.371]  You know, it was about a month and a half ago.
[03:03:09.554 --> 03:03:12.916]  I was looking at my employees and I was thinking about how great they all are.
[03:03:12.916 --> 03:03:17.039]  And I was thinking, well, I just mortgaged my house and that will pay for things through the year.
[03:03:17.039 --> 03:03:19.300]  God, I don't want to lay these people off.
[03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:22.322]  And I just remember having a prayer and God said, you don't have to worry about it.
[03:03:23.419 --> 03:03:27.041]  If you just stay the course, you're going to get the financing you need.
[03:03:27.041 --> 03:03:31.083]  And coronavirus came along and we've gotten financing.
[03:03:31.083 --> 03:03:34.464]  If current sales continue into next year.
[03:03:34.464 --> 03:03:36.305]  So we didn't ask for it.
[03:03:36.305 --> 03:03:37.386]  We didn't want it.
[03:03:37.386 --> 03:03:41.508]  But now I've got a provision and try to expand things and I will in the fight.
[03:03:42.408 --> 03:03:46.353]  The Lord works a mysterious way, so protect yourself.
[03:03:46.353 --> 03:03:50.437]  Everybody, man, woman, child, should be using DNA Force Plus.
[03:03:50.437 --> 03:03:51.499]  Totally.
[03:03:51.499 --> 03:03:53.401]  The best thing you do for your immune system.
[03:03:53.401 --> 03:03:53.901]  X2, X3.
[03:03:56.004 --> 03:03:58.366]  You should be getting the Vitamin Refusion.
[03:03:58.366 --> 03:04:02.089]  You should be getting the colloidal silver products we have at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:04:02.089 --> 03:04:03.810]  And I never even said this today.
[03:04:03.810 --> 03:04:05.552]  It's been back in a week.
[03:04:05.552 --> 03:04:07.013]  I've been so busy.
[03:04:07.013 --> 03:04:09.055]  Our number one energy seller.
[03:04:09.055 --> 03:04:11.617]  Five, no, six different forms of clean burning energy.
[03:04:11.617 --> 03:04:13.058]  10-hour clean energy.
[03:04:13.058 --> 03:04:16.361]  TurboForce is back in stock after months of being sold out.
[03:04:16.361 --> 03:04:18.002]  40% off at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:04:20.584 --> 03:04:21.825]  And it's a war.
[03:04:21.825 --> 03:04:27.848]  And you work hard, and you put your energy into things, and you get those credits, those digital credits, that are crap.
[03:04:27.848 --> 03:04:33.251]  But you put them into real things, then you transmute the fraud of the bankers into something real.
[03:04:33.251 --> 03:04:36.033]  Your work is real, your labor's real, what they're doing is fraudulent.
[03:04:36.033 --> 03:04:42.956]  But through that, you transmute it, you get the turbo force, and you experience healthy, good, 10-hour energy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:04:42.956 --> 03:04:44.137]  So get yours now.
[03:04:44.137 --> 03:04:46.839]  It's back in stock, 40% off, and so is DNA Force+.
[03:04:46.839 --> 03:04:49.220]  Paul Joseph Watson from England.
[03:04:49.740 --> 03:04:57.903]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[03:04:57.903 --> 03:05:00.624]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[03:05:00.624 --> 03:05:02.325]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[03:05:02.325 --> 03:05:04.006]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[03:05:04.006 --> 03:05:04.946]  That was a crazy week.
[03:05:04.946 --> 03:05:16.630]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:17.951]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[03:05:19.417 --> 03:05:21.819]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[03:05:21.819 --> 03:05:23.220]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[03:05:23.220 --> 03:05:27.463]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[03:05:27.463 --> 03:05:29.684]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[03:05:29.684 --> 03:05:31.205]  I don't think that happens very often.
[03:05:31.205 --> 03:05:32.006]  It's never happened to me.
[03:05:32.006 --> 03:05:34.928]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[03:05:34.928 --> 03:05:36.609]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[03:05:36.749 --> 03:05:39.531]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[03:05:39.531 --> 03:05:47.497]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[03:05:47.497 --> 03:05:50.820]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[03:05:50.820 --> 03:05:52.341]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:03.082]  Paul Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom.
[03:06:03.082 --> 03:06:10.646]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.646 --> 03:06:15.429]  And we are live in the Summit View, now a portion of the show.
[03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:17.971]  Got an absolute ton of news to cover, as per usual.
[03:06:17.971 --> 03:06:27.096]  Gonna start off with an impassioned, crucial, vital speech that was given by Marine Le Pen, who of course narrowly lost out in the French presidential election back in 2017.
[03:06:28.985 --> 03:06:35.129]  At a pivotal moment when they said, this is the end of populism, it stops here with the victory of President Macron.
[03:06:35.129 --> 03:06:37.471]  Didn't quite turn out to be that way, did it?
[03:06:37.471 --> 03:06:41.154]  But she's back in the French Parliament today, giving a speech.
[03:06:41.154 --> 03:06:46.938]  Headline up on summit.news, Marine Le Pen calls for referendum to stop submersion of France.
[03:06:46.938 --> 03:06:51.261]  That's her word, submersion of France via mass immigration.
[03:06:51.261 --> 03:06:57.986]  This was a debate, basically a theatrical Punch and Judy show that they set up to talk about mass immigration.
[03:06:58.812 --> 03:07:26.512]  As tens of thousands of migrants once again mass on the border of Turkey and Greece following President Erdogan's announcement in Turkey that he will basically unleash the floodgates, again using migrants as a weapon, we're taught in the West that migrants are this great source of diversity and cultural enrichment, then why is the President of Turkey literally using them as a weapon to bully and intimidate the EU and European countries?
[03:07:27.478 --> 03:07:39.204]  Well, Marine Le Pen touched on that in her speech today, where she called for a national referendum in order to stop what she called the submersion of France via a globalist program of mass immigration.
[03:07:39.204 --> 03:07:56.473]  Speaking during a debate on the issue in the French Parliament, she scorched the political establishment for overseeing the dilution of French identity at the expense of ordinary people, saying that the last 30 years of immigration laws were designed to be ineffective and resulted in nothing more than political grandstanding.
[03:07:57.136 --> 03:08:06.183]  And again, she said that mass immigration, once a taboo topic to even talk about, is now at the front and centre of political debate.
[03:08:06.183 --> 03:08:20.795]  Despite the continuing efforts by the left, by the globalists, by the mass media, to denounce the very prospect of discussing demographic changes as some great extremist white supremacist conspiracy theory, well Marine Le Pen
[03:08:21.855 --> 03:08:23.236]  Successfully shot that down.
[03:08:23.236 --> 03:08:33.805]  She said French people quote recognize the uncontrolled immigration is a threat, a threat to their daily lives, to their way of life, and even at times a threat to their lives.
[03:08:33.805 --> 03:08:37.228]  She said our country is experiencing a veritable submersion.
[03:08:37.228 --> 03:08:38.248]  Yes, a submersion.
[03:08:38.248 --> 03:08:39.790]  I dare use that term.
[03:08:39.790 --> 03:08:41.131]  Bear in mind this is somebody who
[03:08:42.541 --> 03:08:52.148]  Last time, I haven't checked up on it recently, but she was under threat of going to prison for sharing ISIS propaganda on Twitter, on social media, while denouncing ISIS.
[03:08:52.148 --> 03:08:54.169]  They tried to put her in prison for that.
[03:08:54.169 --> 03:08:56.091]  I think that legal tussle is ongoing.
[03:08:57.017 --> 03:09:13.213]  But now she's talking about mass migration as a form of submersion because it describes the reality of the unbroken wave that is crashing upon our cities, our towns and now because of your irresponsible policy of placing migrants in rural areas, even the smallest villages.
[03:09:13.213 --> 03:09:17.357]  She accused French politicians of treason for failing to defend their people.
[03:09:18.123 --> 03:09:31.008]  She said, without ever consulting the people, they organized the streams of legal migration and tolerated illegal immigration, saying it was driven by the globalist ideology that guides them inexorably.
[03:09:31.008 --> 03:09:36.791]  And she successfully pinpointed how the globalists view the mass of humanity, which is, quote,
[03:09:37.808 --> 03:09:53.645]  Reducing man to his economic dimension as a producer and consumer, an interchangeable man with no identity or cultural reference points, nothing but a cog in the wheel of global commerce, as they import the hordes to be their servants, slave class,
[03:09:54.642 --> 03:10:00.384]  While of course pushing out, marginalising, demonising anyone who stands up against that.
[03:10:00.384 --> 03:10:10.468]  Very opportune, very crucial moment to be talking about mass migration with tens of thousands of migrants, as I said, which the media is calling, once again, refugees.
[03:10:11.497 --> 03:10:13.077]  Massing on the border.
[03:10:13.077 --> 03:10:15.578]  Erdogan's threatened up to a million or more.
[03:10:15.578 --> 03:10:17.498]  Thousands already there.
[03:10:17.498 --> 03:10:20.099]  Stories about migrants being shot, maybe being killed.
[03:10:20.099 --> 03:10:21.479]  The Greek government's denied that.
[03:10:21.479 --> 03:10:22.620]  But why are we talking about this?
[03:10:22.620 --> 03:10:26.221]  Why is it important in relation to France?
[03:10:26.221 --> 03:10:31.942]  Well, because the French massacre, the 2015 France-Paris massacre,
[03:10:32.668 --> 03:10:51.325]  The terrorists, some of them, exploited the refugee program that started in 2015 to slip into France via Greece to carry out that massacre, leading to, what was it, over 150 people dead, hundreds more injured during that horrific night in Paris.
[03:10:51.325 --> 03:10:54.508]  Which is why I flash back to this article, which I wrote in 2015, November 14th, 2015.
[03:10:57.981 --> 03:11:04.206]  Report, Paris attacker was Syrian refugee who arrived in Greece last month.
[03:11:04.206 --> 03:11:20.739]  Literally a month before the Paris massacre, one of the terrorists who helped carry out, slipped through Europe's poorest borders on the back of this refugee humanitarian crisis, went on to help slaughter hundreds of people.
[03:11:20.739 --> 03:11:26.364]  In fact, it later turned out that he was the bomber at the Stade de France during the Germany versus France soccer game.
[03:11:27.668 --> 03:11:35.096]  Because the next month I wrote this article, ISIS brags about exploiting refugee program to send sleeper cells to Europe.
[03:11:35.096 --> 03:11:41.142]  This was their own 99 page manifesto which bragged about how the terror organization had exploited.
[03:11:41.713 --> 03:11:50.657]  The refugee programme, the same programme that mass media is trying to propagandise us into accepting once again, to send jihadist sleeper cells to Europe.
[03:11:50.657 --> 03:12:02.201]  Not my words, the words of ISIS in their own manifesto, in their own magazine called Black Flags of Rome, which we quoted from in this article five years ago.
[03:12:02.201 --> 03:12:10.985]  It says, at least three individuals who posed as refugees have now been connected to the Paris attacks, including the mastermind behind the plot.
[03:12:12.293 --> 03:12:24.049]  Including, as well, the first Stade de France suicide bomber, Ahmad al-Homadad, who used a fake Syrian passport to enter Europe as an asylum seeker via Greece.
[03:12:24.049 --> 03:12:27.454]  And ISIS openly bragged in their own manifesto, quote,
[03:12:28.231 --> 03:12:33.554]  No doubt, some of these refugees were undercover fighters of Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.
[03:12:33.554 --> 03:12:46.983]  They were quick to take the opportunity of entering into the different countries of Europe as early as 2012 via this migrant refugee red carpet, which is happening once again right now.
[03:12:46.983 --> 03:12:49.984]  As we continue to be told, that diversity is a strength.
[03:12:49.984 --> 03:12:57.229]  Meanwhile in Paris, there's an article from a few days ago, Congolese migrants riot in Paris, set fire to dozens of vehicles,
[03:12:58.658 --> 03:13:01.839]  This was a crowd consisting primarily of Congolese migrants who rioted.
[03:13:01.839 --> 03:13:10.362]  They rioted in response to a Congolese musician, I think he was a rapper, who was friendly with the government back in the Congo.
[03:13:10.362 --> 03:13:19.085]  They weren't happy about it, so they decided to respond by just setting fire to 30 different vehicles, because that's a reasonable response, isn't it?
[03:13:19.085 --> 03:13:25.787]  They set fire to areas around Gare de Lyon train station in Paris, which if you've been to Paris since
[03:13:26.744 --> 03:13:32.105]  The migrant wave of 2015 has kind of changed a little bit, just a little bit.
[03:13:32.105 --> 03:13:39.187]  So they set fire to 30 vehicles, they set fire to areas around one of the main train stations there in France.
[03:13:39.187 --> 03:13:50.350]  And again, this is why Marine Le Pen is giving this speech today, calling for a referendum, a national referendum on stopping mass migration before it's too late in France.
[03:13:50.350 --> 03:13:52.290]  Some people would say it was already too late.
[03:13:52.290 --> 03:13:55.491]  And speaking of those migrants who are massing on the border,
[03:13:56.798 --> 03:14:02.261]  The doctors, the lawyers, the scientists who we badly need to culturally enrich our society.
[03:14:02.261 --> 03:14:05.383]  Greek Orthodox Church trashed by refugees.
[03:14:05.383 --> 03:14:12.247]  We saw again, massive wave of attacks on Christian churches across Europe over the past four years.
[03:14:12.247 --> 03:14:13.368]  Gee, I wonder why that is?
[03:14:13.368 --> 03:14:22.774]  And of course, if you even suggest that the Notre Dame Cathedral was not an accidental act, then they'll cancel you.
[03:14:22.774 --> 03:14:24.355]  In fact, I remember the story we had with
[03:14:25.407 --> 03:14:30.148]  The Facebook live feed of Al Jazeera and France 24 Arabic, of course.
[03:14:30.148 --> 03:14:48.351]  As Notre Dame burned in the background, the chat, the live scrolling chat, was literally going absolutely haywire with people celebrating, people saying Al-Araqba, people posting smiley emoticons, people with names, shall we say, of a certain demographic.
[03:14:48.351 --> 03:14:51.472]  BuzzFeed then wrote a story about me claiming that
[03:14:52.032 --> 03:14:56.756]  And said, oh, we don't, they were celebrating, yeah, but we don't know what they were celebrating.
[03:14:56.756 --> 03:15:11.308]  Oh, no, they were just doing it while Notre Dame was burning, while the spire was collapsing, and while a video of the live feed of Notre Dame burning to the ground was playing on the Facebook pages of Al Jazeera and France 24 Arabic.
[03:15:11.308 --> 03:15:13.810]  Gee, I wonder what they were celebrating.
[03:15:13.810 --> 03:15:15.832]  Of course, BuzzFeed called that fake news.
[03:15:16.519 --> 03:15:23.105]  Now, an Orthodox church on the Greek island of Lesbos was trashed by refugees, according to local media reports.
[03:15:23.105 --> 03:15:24.627]  There are pictures of this.
[03:15:24.627 --> 03:15:35.177]  Greek City Times reported more than 500 refugees grouped together to head down to the port of Mytilene from Mariah Kemp, and they trashed yet another Christian church.
[03:15:35.177 --> 03:15:37.479]  I'm going to come back in the next segment and talk about
[03:15:38.405 --> 03:15:42.388]  More in terms of what's coming up in the future of this refugee crisis.
[03:15:42.388 --> 03:15:50.953]  We're going to talk about the WHO once again saying that mean words and insults are more important than preventing the global coronavirus pandemic.
[03:15:50.953 --> 03:15:51.854]  Don't go away.
[03:15:51.854 --> 03:15:53.075]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:53.075 --> 03:15:56.997]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:56.997 --> 03:15:58.538]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.538 --> 03:16:01.060]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:07.066]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:07.066 --> 03:16:08.267]  I can help you too.
[03:16:08.267 --> 03:16:11.190]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.190 --> 03:16:13.412]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.412 --> 03:16:17.857]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.
[03:16:17.857 --> 03:16:19.558]  That's DanPilla.com.

[03:16:21.360 --> 03:16:27.703]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:27.703 --> 03:16:30.744]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:30.744 --> 03:16:36.666]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:36.666 --> 03:16:40.468]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:40.468 --> 03:16:41.728]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:41.728 --> 03:16:43.069]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:43.069 --> 03:16:49.271]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:49.271 --> 03:16:50.712]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:51.701 --> 03:16:54.723]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:16:54.723 --> 03:16:57.626]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[03:16:57.626 --> 03:17:04.832]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[03:17:52.574 --> 03:17:54.296]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[03:17:54.296 --> 03:17:56.399]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[03:17:56.399 --> 03:17:58.161]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[03:17:58.161 --> 03:17:59.903]  But I'll be honest with you.
[03:17:59.903 --> 03:18:05.250]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[03:18:05.250 --> 03:18:07.133]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[03:18:07.133 --> 03:18:08.414]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[03:18:08.414 --> 03:18:09.155]  But here's the bottom line.
[03:18:10.171 --> 03:18:11.631]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[03:18:11.631 --> 03:18:14.332]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[03:18:14.332 --> 03:18:15.492]  I don't want them to win.
[03:18:15.492 --> 03:18:18.413]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[03:18:18.413 --> 03:18:21.513]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[03:18:21.513 --> 03:18:24.674]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[03:18:24.674 --> 03:18:28.475]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[03:18:28.475 --> 03:18:30.055]  These will change your life.
[03:18:30.055 --> 03:18:31.455]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[03:18:31.455 --> 03:18:33.456]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[03:18:33.456 --> 03:18:34.156]  Check it all out.
[03:18:34.156 --> 03:18:36.096]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[03:18:36.096 --> 03:18:37.877]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[03:18:37.877 --> 03:18:39.077]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[03:18:39.457 --> 03:18:40.838]  Get great products the same time.
[03:18:40.838 --> 03:18:43.321]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[03:18:43.321 --> 03:18:45.483]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[03:18:45.483 --> 03:18:48.586]  Take action now and fund the InfoWar for your own future.
[03:18:52.560 --> 03:19:00.890]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[03:19:00.890 --> 03:19:07.857]  And instead of just giving into sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[03:19:07.857 --> 03:19:09.980]  And I say that from personal experience.
[03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:24.911]  Because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day, and that power pack that they have, the AM-PM power pack, well, I wouldn't be so energetic this morning, except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[03:19:25.572 --> 03:19:47.062]  I'll start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose, for our families and for our communities.
[03:19:47.062 --> 03:19:52.345]  And right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[03:19:55.157 --> 03:20:05.463]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:05.463 --> 03:20:14.868]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:14.868 --> 03:20:20.611]  So, Maureen Le Pen, leader of the National Rally, the renamed National Front Party,
[03:20:21.954 --> 03:20:28.142]  She went and did a speech in front of the French Parliament in which she said that France was being subsumed by mass migration.
[03:20:28.142 --> 03:20:33.889]  She's called for a referendum on that, as tens of thousands of migrants again mass at the border.
[03:20:33.889 --> 03:20:40.778]  Of course, if those Greek patrols are broken through, if they're violated, despite the EU promising to send
[03:20:41.790 --> 03:20:47.895]  More security forces down to the border, that could then precipitate another mass wave of migrants heading into Europe.
[03:20:47.895 --> 03:20:50.637]  Up to 2 million already did so in 2015.
[03:20:50.637 --> 03:21:02.027]  Shortly afterwards we had the Paris Massacre, which was carried out by some individuals who exploited that refugee red carpet to slip into Europe via Greece.
[03:21:02.027 --> 03:21:03.608]  I emphasize that over and over again.
[03:21:03.608 --> 03:21:05.710]  ISIS later bragged about it in their own manifesto.
[03:21:06.750 --> 03:21:15.218]  Meanwhile in Paris, Congolese migrants are setting fire to vehicles and areas around the main train station there in Paris, rioting.
[03:21:15.218 --> 03:21:22.604]  Meanwhile, beacon of patriotism, Norwegian MP wants referendum on immigration, so he's mirroring what Marine Le Pen said.
[03:21:22.604 --> 03:21:32.053]  These are the words of Progress Party leader, Christian Tybring-Gedda, who said Norway must put a complete hull on non-Western immigration.
[03:21:32.053 --> 03:21:33.054]  He's calling for that.
[03:21:33.669 --> 03:21:40.214]  We had another church in Greece which was trashed by refugees according to local media reports there.
[03:21:40.214 --> 03:21:45.018]  We had the report yesterday of a migrant allegedly being killed by Greek security forces.
[03:21:45.018 --> 03:21:51.923]  Greece itself, I note, the Greek government denied that that happened, said it was Erdogan putting out fake news.
[03:21:51.923 --> 03:21:58.668]  Then we have this, up on summit.news, Turkish human trafficker brags, I've filled Europe with immigrants.
[03:21:59.366 --> 03:22:10.812]  This is an interview with a man in Turkey who is alleged to be a human trafficker bragging about how he filled Europe with immigrants and how he's making thousands of euros after Turkey opened its borders.
[03:22:10.812 --> 03:22:21.538]  The man said he'd been trafficking people for 20 years and that receives 500 to 600 euros per head for each migrant he successfully exports despite serving six years in jail for the crime.
[03:22:21.538 --> 03:22:26.481]  He brags about how he is back in business following President Erdogan's announcement
[03:22:27.341 --> 03:22:32.542]  That Turkey would be reopening its border and encouraging millions of migrants to invade Europe.
[03:22:32.542 --> 03:22:33.723]  And he's open about it.
[03:22:33.723 --> 03:22:35.583]  He says, I'm making money.
[03:22:35.583 --> 03:22:37.543]  Business is booming.
[03:22:37.543 --> 03:22:42.665]  Again, this is meanwhile, Erdogan's on television saying, I told them it's done, it's finished.
[03:22:42.665 --> 03:22:45.125]  The doors are now wide open.
[03:22:45.125 --> 03:22:47.446]  Now you will take your share of the burden.
[03:22:47.446 --> 03:22:52.947]  He is promising millions more migrants to culturally enrich Europe.
[03:22:52.947 --> 03:22:56.808]  While Greek coast guards, and you've probably seen this video, it's at the bottom of this article,
[03:22:57.785 --> 03:23:06.189]  They're literally using giant poles to try and bat away these migrants in boats trying to get them to go back to Turkey.
[03:23:06.189 --> 03:23:21.577]  So it's an absolutely critical situation and time will tell over the next few days and week or so how bad it really gets because of course if enough of them make it to the border and overwhelm the Greek security forces then it's game on once again.
[03:23:22.563 --> 03:23:29.669]  Meanwhile, Sputnik reports outrage as Muslim tells hijab opponent to move away from Sweden in televised debate.
[03:23:29.669 --> 03:23:47.063]  Sweden, of course, with its Muslim population of, I think it's approaching 10% on last measurements, well now tensions have heated up in the recent episode of Swedish national broadcaster SVT's program, The Meeting, where the local ban on religious headdress in the Skurup municipality was discussed.
[03:23:47.063 --> 03:23:50.326]  Basically a teacher there, a Muslim teacher who wears a hijab,
[03:23:51.576 --> 03:23:59.302]  told her debate opponent who said you cannot come to a country that is secular and equal and live with medieval values.
[03:23:59.302 --> 03:24:06.007]  Well if there's any country which will welcome people into doing that with open arms it's going to be Sweden.
[03:24:06.007 --> 03:24:12.332]  In fact I remember writing stories about how the official church of Sweden during the height of the 2015-2016 migrant crisis
[03:24:15.271 --> 03:24:24.894]  Removed Christian religious symbols from Christian churches as they were bringing in all these Muslim migrants so as not to offend them.
[03:24:24.894 --> 03:24:29.976]  And that seems to be the main bone of contention once again in Sweden with that debate.
[03:24:29.976 --> 03:24:34.297]  Speaking about people being offended, Breitbart reports
[03:24:34.952 --> 03:24:41.353]  World Health Organization warns against hurtful words, damaged feelings in coronavirus fight.
[03:24:41.353 --> 03:24:48.095]  This is literally the fifth or sixth time they've done this in the space of four weeks.
[03:24:48.095 --> 03:24:52.496]  I stopped writing articles about it because I was just repeating myself over and over again.
[03:24:52.496 --> 03:24:54.936]  But they've said it again!
[03:24:54.936 --> 03:25:02.158]  Even as Italy is overwhelmed by coronavirus victims, of course Iran, their own government leaders are dying of coronavirus.
[03:25:02.158 --> 03:25:03.418]  We've got the UK government
[03:25:04.292 --> 03:25:15.096]  Saying worst case scenario, 80% of the entire country may be infected and even if 1 or 2% die, it's still going to mean up to half a million people dead.
[03:25:15.096 --> 03:25:24.600]  They're talking about using Hyde Park, which is literally three miles from where I live, as a temporary morgue to cope with all the victims.
[03:25:24.600 --> 03:25:28.662]  Talking about putting dead bodies in tents in the biggest park in London.
[03:25:29.591 --> 03:25:37.172]  But what's a bigger concern than that is people using mean words on the internet.
[03:25:37.172 --> 03:25:46.894]  Using incorrect words and language may have a negative meaning and fuel stigmatising attitudes towards coronavirus victims, the World Health Organisation warned on Monday.
[03:25:46.894 --> 03:25:56.396]  And it's this same idiot who's fronting this once again, whose name I'm not even going to attempt to pronounce because I attempted it last time and it was a miserable failure.
[03:25:58.502 --> 03:25:59.443]  Let's do it anyway.
[03:25:59.443 --> 03:26:14.873]  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, probably butchering that, don't care because he's a complete idiot, released a document that cautioned those who associate the viral epidemic with China, Wuhan or Asia in particular to be more aware of people's feelings.
[03:26:14.873 --> 03:26:24.659]  So you can't say the word China, Wuhan or Asia when describing a virus that came out of Wuhan in China in Asia.
[03:26:24.659 --> 03:26:27.681]  That's more important than stopping a global pandemic.
[03:26:30.731 --> 03:26:39.476]  He literally said the stigma around coronavirus is, quote, more dangerous than the virus itself.
[03:26:39.476 --> 03:26:40.697]  Tweet.
[03:26:40.697 --> 03:26:43.599]  World Health Organization official Twitter account.
[03:26:43.599 --> 03:26:51.604]  When talking about COVID-19, that's what they renamed it to because apparently coronavirus might may hurt someone's feelings somewhere.
[03:26:51.604 --> 03:26:57.868]  Certain words and language may have a negative meaning for people and fuel stigmatizing attitudes.
[03:26:57.868 --> 03:26:58.929]  And I think he came out with a
[03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:01.421]  Another tweet after that.
[03:27:01.421 --> 03:27:04.222]  Let me try and find it.
[03:27:04.222 --> 03:27:07.564]  Again, World Health Organization official account.
[03:27:07.564 --> 03:27:11.145]  This tweet was put out about an hour later.
[03:27:11.145 --> 03:27:17.088]  Do talk about people acquiring or contracting COVID-19.
[03:27:17.088 --> 03:27:26.893]  Don't talk about people transmitting COVID-19, infecting others or spreading the virus as it implies intentional transmission and assigns blame
[03:27:27.921 --> 03:27:35.245]  So you can't even use the word transmitting or infecting, because again, it might hurt somebody's feelings.
[03:27:35.245 --> 03:27:41.628]  This is the global body tasked with preventing a global pandemic.
[03:27:41.628 --> 03:27:48.091]  And day after day, they're tweeting about politically incorrect words, which are not even politically incorrect.
[03:27:48.091 --> 03:27:49.651]  Yes, it came out of Wuhan.
[03:27:49.651 --> 03:27:51.072]  Yes, it came out of China.
[03:27:51.072 --> 03:27:53.073]  Yes, it's called coronavirus.
[03:27:53.073 --> 03:27:54.894]  Yes, people are infected with it.
[03:27:56.187 --> 03:28:01.151]  Yes, people are spreading it, primarily because of wide open borders.
[03:28:01.151 --> 03:28:07.017]  You'll note that Russia only had a couple of cases because they closed their border with China immediately.
[03:28:07.017 --> 03:28:09.679]  Same with Mongolia and some of these other countries.
[03:28:09.679 --> 03:28:15.604]  Not Italy, not Europe, and now it's everywhere in Europe because we have no borders left.
[03:28:15.604 --> 03:28:17.045]  That's not important though.
[03:28:17.045 --> 03:28:20.829]  What's important is that some Chinese person somewhere might be offended.
[03:28:22.310 --> 03:28:27.152]  The Ethiopian pointed journalists and commentators towards a special WHO document.
[03:28:27.152 --> 03:28:37.855]  They've put out like three of these documents where half the document is, don't use this word, don't talk about it in this way, don't describe it in this way, now it's called something else, now you have to use this term.
[03:28:37.855 --> 03:28:43.497]  Like when they started calling ISIS Daesh and said, oh you shouldn't call it ISIS, it might offend Muslims.
[03:28:43.497 --> 03:28:51.020]  No, we're going to call it what it is, we're going to continue to speak the truth about how it's spreading primarily because of porous borders.
[03:28:51.020 --> 03:28:51.500]  Don't go away.
[03:28:51.980 --> 03:28:53.942]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:53.942 --> 03:28:59.246]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:28:59.246 --> 03:29:00.848]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:00.848 --> 03:29:09.195]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:09.195 --> 03:29:14.900]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:15.060 --> 03:29:16.881]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:16.881 --> 03:29:19.163]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:19.163 --> 03:29:23.546]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:23.546 --> 03:29:25.747]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:29:25.747 --> 03:29:31.791]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their
[03:29:32.091 --> 03:29:33.633]  Cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:32:49.657 --> 03:32:51.979]  InfoWars, brought to you by you.
[03:32:56.098 --> 03:33:05.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.442 --> 03:33:15.027]  Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:18.243 --> 03:33:23.767]  Now, earlier we were talking about the latest with the potentially new global migrant crisis.
[03:33:23.767 --> 03:33:31.432]  Of course, over the past four or five years that has precipitated a wave of increased violent crime in many European countries.
[03:33:31.432 --> 03:33:37.335]  In fact, the German government's own statistics say that 90% of their violent crime increased 10%.
[03:33:37.335 --> 03:33:41.558]  90% of that was the responsibility of migrants brought into the country after that first refugee wave.
[03:33:48.072 --> 03:34:13.347]  We've of course had many grooming gang scandals in the United Kingdom and in other countries, including in Finland, where in 2018, after having suffered their first Islamic terror attack, and I believe it was 2017, in 2018 they had a massive grooming gang scandal in the country of Finland, and once again it turned out that certain authorities, certain politicians, certain media outlets had tried to cover it up, tried to bury it.
[03:34:14.412 --> 03:34:18.354]  And once again, it led to problems with increased rape of women.
[03:34:18.354 --> 03:34:21.456]  Well, now they have a fantastic, ingenious new solution.
[03:34:21.456 --> 03:34:29.421]  I'm going to roll the video here in a second to prevent rape, particularly migrant rape in the aftermath of this refugee wave.
[03:34:29.421 --> 03:34:35.004]  And it's simply and purely to tell the rapist, no.
[03:34:35.004 --> 03:34:38.426]  Yes, that's literally what they're telling women in Finland.
[03:34:38.426 --> 03:34:39.047]  Let's go ahead.
[03:34:39.047 --> 03:34:39.627]  Here's the clip.
[03:34:45.892 --> 03:34:52.357]  Finland's new left-wing government has finally found a solution to the rape problem plaguing Europe.
[03:34:52.357 --> 03:34:53.117]  Stop!
[03:34:53.117 --> 03:34:56.220]  Don't touch me there!
[03:34:56.220 --> 03:34:59.522]  This is my no-no square!
[03:34:59.522 --> 03:35:01.143]  Stop!
[03:35:01.143 --> 03:35:02.844]  Don't touch me there!
[03:35:02.844 --> 03:35:06.507]  This is my no-no square!
[03:35:06.507 --> 03:35:07.668]  Rapists BTFO!
[03:35:07.668 --> 03:35:07.968]  Stop!
[03:35:07.968 --> 03:35:09.369]  Don't touch me there!
[03:35:09.369 --> 03:35:12.151]  Who knew it was that easy to stop a rapist?
[03:35:12.898 --> 03:35:15.299]  Just say no!
[03:35:15.299 --> 03:35:22.003]  When Abdullah's coming for you in a dark alleyway with a thirst for a bit of cultural enrichment, just politely decline.
[03:35:22.003 --> 03:35:24.805]  What could possibly go wrong?
[03:35:24.805 --> 03:35:34.270]  So the idea is that if you're a ten-year-old girl trapped in an apartment with ten horny Iraqis, just say stop, don't touch me there, this is my no-no square, and it'll be fine.
[03:35:35.416 --> 03:35:42.620]  If the galaxy brains behind this video had been just that bit quicker off the draw, maybe Harvey Weinstein and the Me Too movement would have never happened.
[03:35:42.620 --> 03:35:43.340]  Stop.
[03:35:43.340 --> 03:35:44.281]  Don't touch me there.
[03:35:44.281 --> 03:35:46.322]  This is my no-no square.
[03:35:46.322 --> 03:35:53.005]  Apparently this is part of a 2.5 million euro program aimed at combating Finland's rape epidemic.
[03:35:53.005 --> 03:35:56.607]  And if your friendly local rapist does manage to impose on your no-no square,
[03:35:56.887 --> 03:36:02.174]  There's always the backup option of this alarmed anti-rape underwear made in Germany.
[03:36:02.174 --> 03:36:10.724]  Because Europe enjoys open border policies so progressive that women are afraid to walk the streets unless they're wearing high-tech chastity belts.
[03:36:10.724 --> 03:36:11.645]  So progressive.
[03:36:20.473 --> 03:36:32.299]  I just can't decide whether this is more or less cringe than a 2016 video, also out of Finland, which encouraged women to use the force to deter would-be rapists.
[03:36:32.299 --> 03:36:35.000]  Yeah, they actually did that, and this is not a parody video.
[03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:49.387]  The video also educated women that swinging their handbag is a sufficient way to make a determined sexual predator lose his nerve, because Mohammed and his mates are really gonna s*** their pants at the prospect of a Louis Vuitton being weakly flailed in their general direction.
[03:36:50.487 --> 03:37:05.415]  Just be thankful that newly arrived migrants in Finland are being taught not to rape via the medium of children's nursery rhymes.
[03:37:05.415 --> 03:37:06.216]  That'll stop them.
[03:37:06.216 --> 03:37:09.677]  Why is Finland experiencing a migrant rape crisis?
[03:37:09.677 --> 03:37:12.139]  Must be all those Russians and Estonians, right?
[03:37:12.139 --> 03:37:12.359]  Yeah.
[03:37:13.433 --> 03:37:14.535]  Not quite.
[03:37:14.535 --> 03:37:16.597]  But officer, her mouth isn't in the no-no square.
[03:37:28.733 --> 03:37:46.128]  In 2015, as refugees flooded into Europe, Finnish cops were ordered by the country's National Police Board not to publicly identify migrants as criminal suspects over concerns that doing so would encourage a racist backlash against the wave of asylum seekers entering Scandinavia.
[03:37:46.128 --> 03:37:55.156]  Authorities were seemingly more concerned about negative attitudes being attached to asylum seekers than enlisting the public's help to catch rapists and other violent
[03:37:55.777 --> 03:38:02.384]  Then, in early 2016, interest in Finnish women taking self-defence classes suddenly exploded.
[03:38:02.384 --> 03:38:03.766]  Gee, I wonder why?
[03:38:03.766 --> 03:38:12.416]  The mass molestation of 2,000 women in Cologne, Germany on New Year's Eve 2015, committed almost entirely by asylum seekers and migrants,
[03:38:13.560 --> 03:38:15.442]  Might have had something to do with it.
[03:38:15.442 --> 03:38:22.928]  A 2018 study found that 93% of sex crimes in Finland committed by migrants are committed by migrants from Islamic countries.
[03:38:22.928 --> 03:38:33.337]  While only one person in 14 on the Finnish archipelago is of non-Scandinavian descent, their proportion among those convicted of rape is a staggering 38%.
[03:38:33.337 --> 03:38:41.484]  According to official figures, Iraqi and Afghan asylum seekers were up to 40 times more likely than native Finns to be suspects in sexual crimes in Finland.
[03:38:41.584 --> 03:38:51.347]  Finnish refugee counsellor Ala Saeed said that the problem stems from Iraqis coming from a culture where they can do anything to women without facing any consequences.
[03:38:51.347 --> 03:38:57.049]  Also in 2018, Finnish authorities busted a grooming gang in the city of Oulu that trafficked girls as young as 10.
[03:38:58.189 --> 03:39:00.671]  One of the victims later committed suicide.
[03:39:00.671 --> 03:39:06.595]  The gang was made up of migrant men who were reported to be quota refugees from the Middle East.
[03:39:06.595 --> 03:39:17.122]  According to activist Tina Wick, it even turned out that some of the grooming gang members who were convicted were taken to a kids running contest to integrate before they were arrested.
[03:39:17.122 --> 03:39:20.244]  Migrants were subsequently banned from visiting local schools.
[03:39:20.384 --> 03:39:30.087]  This, after a Finnish police superintendent said that asylum seekers with terrorist sympathies should be allowed into schools to expand tolerance.
[03:39:30.087 --> 03:39:41.750]  According to police statistics from the city of Oulu, between 2018 and 2019, rape offences, where crimes in which the suspect is a foreign citizen, jumped by a whopping 157%.
[03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:48.892]  So as you can see, those Russian and Estonian migrants really do need to stop touching those no-no squares.
[03:39:50.083 --> 03:39:53.968]  This video was produced by the city of Ola.
[03:39:53.968 --> 03:39:58.354]  Yes, this is their actual response to everything I just described.
[03:39:58.354 --> 03:40:06.305]  And of course, anyone who draws attention to the true source of the problem, like this group of women in Paris, are attacked and vilified as racists.
[03:40:06.505 --> 03:40:13.793]  While a member of Finland's left-wing Green Party actively tried to stop a plane taking off to prevent a migrant's deportation.
[03:40:13.793 --> 03:40:19.839]  Finland's rape problem is also exacerbated by its weak sentences for convicted rapists.
[03:40:19.839 --> 03:40:27.407]  In 2018, a top Finnish court ruled that despite 23-year-old asylum seeker Yusuf Mohammed Abedin having sex with a 10-year-old girl,
[03:40:27.947 --> 03:40:33.589]  The assault did not constitute rape because supposedly the girl consented.
[03:40:33.589 --> 03:40:42.452]  Last week, Turkey opened the floodgates to tens of thousands of migrants who are now massing at the Greek border, attempting to enter Europe.
[03:40:42.452 --> 03:40:49.634]  And personally, I can't wait for all these new doctors, lawyers and scientists to make their invaluable contribution to society.
[03:40:57.663 --> 03:41:13.808]  There you go, that's how Finland is dealing with its new rape epidemic following the mass migration of hundreds of thousands of people from certain areas of the world who don't tend to share our respect for women.
[03:41:13.808 --> 03:41:15.428]  Just say no!
[03:41:15.428 --> 03:41:19.489]  Meanwhile, I read this story just before I got on the air.
[03:41:19.489 --> 03:41:20.610]  It's up at summit.news.
[03:41:20.610 --> 03:41:25.611]  Waitress attempts to boot Milo from restaurant ends up getting fired.
[03:41:26.471 --> 03:41:36.415]  This was at a restaurant, The Fox and Falcon, in New Jersey, where Milo Yiannopoulos was removed for being racist, or she attempted to remove him.
[03:41:36.415 --> 03:41:38.215]  He wasn't actually removed.
[03:41:38.215 --> 03:41:52.741]  He was dining with his black husband and his black friend, but apparently his table was not sufficiently diverse for the waitress, and she vocally complained, why do we allow racist, sexist, anti-Semitic trash here?
[03:41:53.911 --> 03:41:55.651]  Yes, Milo Yiannopoulos.
[03:41:55.651 --> 03:41:57.872]  Racist with his black husband.
[03:41:57.872 --> 03:42:00.253]  Anti-Semitic with his love of Israel.
[03:42:00.253 --> 03:42:03.534]  Why indeed is he allowed into a restaurant?
[03:42:03.534 --> 03:42:08.115]  Well, Milo responded by emailing the PR company that represents the restaurant.
[03:42:08.115 --> 03:42:09.815]  Drew attention to the tweet.
[03:42:09.815 --> 03:42:16.037]  Said he was going to bring a camera crew because he was working on a news story with a local affiliate to talk about political intolerance.
[03:42:16.761 --> 03:42:20.223]  The restaurant responded by firing the waitress.
[03:42:20.223 --> 03:42:35.991]  The waitress, who is now unemployed and no longer a waitress, responded by deleting her Twitter account, but not before Milo could save a couple of her tweets, one of which said a lot this past year I spent running around trying to be the woman a guy can love, and in the end I'm sitting in the porch with wine and fries alone.
[03:42:36.711 --> 03:42:42.259]  Another tweet said, I'm childless and alone besides the cats.
[03:42:42.259 --> 03:42:47.486]  So good luck to that waitress who is now being fired for her intolerance.
[03:42:47.486 --> 03:42:50.090]  Don't go away, Summit.News will be right back.
[03:42:51.778 --> 03:42:59.980]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[03:42:59.980 --> 03:43:00.540]  That's good.
[03:43:00.540 --> 03:43:02.940]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[03:43:02.940 --> 03:43:09.922]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[03:43:09.922 --> 03:43:13.602]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[03:43:13.602 --> 03:43:20.584]  And that means, even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[03:43:21.184 --> 03:43:26.368]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[03:43:26.368 --> 03:43:34.673]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[03:43:34.673 --> 03:43:44.079]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra 12, and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.
[03:43:44.079 --> 03:43:49.723]  Get yours at InfoWareStore.com today, and support the InfoWare while living a healthy and better life.
[03:43:49.723 --> 03:43:50.123]  A total 360 win.
[03:43:51.778 --> 03:43:54.379]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[03:43:54.379 --> 03:44:01.361]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[03:44:01.361 --> 03:44:11.805]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key co-factors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[03:44:12.225 --> 03:44:18.509]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[03:44:18.509 --> 03:44:19.490]  It is back in stock.
[03:44:19.490 --> 03:44:28.716]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[03:44:28.716 --> 03:44:36.160]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[03:44:36.160 --> 03:44:36.621]  And of course,
[03:44:37.481 --> 03:44:44.213]  Vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[03:44:44.213 --> 03:44:50.323]  And they're both back in stock 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:44:53.433 --> 03:44:54.214]  Real stuff, man.
[03:44:54.214 --> 03:44:55.375]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[03:44:55.375 --> 03:45:00.860]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[03:45:00.860 --> 03:45:03.723]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[03:45:03.723 --> 03:45:05.425]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[03:45:05.425 --> 03:45:08.668]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[03:45:09.208 --> 03:45:12.471]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[03:45:12.471 --> 03:45:14.293]  20 different stickers.
[03:45:14.293 --> 03:45:15.934]  Impeach the Democrats.
[03:45:15.934 --> 03:45:16.995]  Save the Second Amendment.
[03:45:16.995 --> 03:45:18.096]  Defend the First Amendment.
[03:45:18.096 --> 03:45:19.417]  Infowars.com.
[03:45:19.417 --> 03:45:21.599]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[03:45:21.599 --> 03:45:26.404]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[03:45:26.404 --> 03:45:27.945]  People say, why are you doing this?
[03:45:27.945 --> 03:45:28.486]  What's happening?
[03:45:28.486 --> 03:45:30.027]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[03:45:30.027 --> 03:45:32.249]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[03:45:32.249 --> 03:45:35.352]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[03:45:35.612 --> 03:45:36.393]  Brilliant.
[03:45:36.393 --> 03:45:43.481]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[03:45:43.481 --> 03:45:46.424]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[03:45:46.424 --> 03:45:49.247]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[03:45:49.247 --> 03:45:49.748]  Silence.
[03:45:52.057 --> 03:45:53.878]  We always promote being prepared.
[03:45:53.878 --> 03:45:57.501]  Having firearms, knowing how to use them, and being self-sufficient.
[03:45:57.501 --> 03:45:59.842]  And learn how to hunt, and learn how to garden.
[03:45:59.842 --> 03:46:01.383]  I mean, it's just, it's what we're meant to do.
[03:46:01.383 --> 03:46:02.604]  It feels good when we do it.
[03:46:02.604 --> 03:46:04.525]  But we do sell high-quality, affordable food.
[03:46:04.525 --> 03:46:07.647]  I told my Patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[03:46:07.647 --> 03:46:08.668]  I said, I think it's gonna be really big.
[03:46:08.668 --> 03:46:10.109]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[03:46:10.109 --> 03:46:13.251]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund
[03:46:13.591 --> 03:46:14.713]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge.
[03:46:14.713 --> 03:46:18.697]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[03:46:18.697 --> 03:46:19.919]  So those are the type of discussions we have.
[03:46:19.919 --> 03:46:21.981]  I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of us.
[03:46:21.981 --> 03:46:25.064]  This is a hundred times regular volume plus.
[03:46:25.064 --> 03:46:26.426]  It was a hundred times a few days ago.
[03:46:26.426 --> 03:46:27.187]  Now it's about 200 times, okay?
[03:46:28.408 --> 03:46:29.509]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:29.509 --> 03:46:30.650]  You go right in the queue.
[03:46:30.650 --> 03:46:31.710]  First come, first serve.
[03:46:31.710 --> 03:46:35.613]  But the fact that the orders are so ultra-massive, it's dizzying.
[03:46:35.613 --> 03:46:37.014]  I mean, this is just insane.
[03:46:37.014 --> 03:46:39.716]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe.
[03:46:39.716 --> 03:46:44.279]  And then, if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[03:46:44.279 --> 03:46:46.321]  But everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food.
[03:46:46.321 --> 03:46:47.982]  But that's how big this is.
[03:46:47.982 --> 03:46:50.824]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on.
[03:46:50.824 --> 03:46:51.765]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:55.524 --> 03:47:08.351]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.351 --> 03:47:16.935]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:19.158 --> 03:47:26.183]  There's a headline here out of CNBC, it says Amazon, Walmart and others battle price gouging on coronavirus-related products.
[03:47:26.183 --> 03:47:35.210]  Of course, we have had shortages of hand sanitizer, surgical masks and some foodstuffs across the entire world.
[03:47:35.210 --> 03:47:42.196]  In fact, I did an article, I believe it was on Friday, about Japan even experiencing shortages of toilet roll.
[03:47:42.196 --> 03:47:47.840]  In the UK, we've had pasta, we've had rice going out of stock, canned goods going out of stock on shelves.
[03:47:48.559 --> 03:47:53.662]  As people begin to panic by an anticipation of potential shortages.
[03:47:53.662 --> 03:48:02.447]  Now with many products sold out in stores, shoppers are racing to online retailers to order face masks, hand sanitizer, hazmat suits and other items to protect against the coronavirus.
[03:48:02.447 --> 03:48:10.231]  Resellers on Amazon and eBay are vastly inflating their prices to try and take advantage of that.
[03:48:10.231 --> 03:48:13.873]  Of course, that's something that we've not done at infowarstore.com.
[03:48:14.577 --> 03:48:17.920]  Well, we do still have the emergency survival foods.
[03:48:17.920 --> 03:48:23.744]  It is on back order because of the massive demand that we've experienced over the past couple of weeks.
[03:48:23.744 --> 03:48:37.976]  In fact, we got a special update on that page from Alex Jones talking about how the orders will be delayed, but they will get out to you if you get yourself in that queue for delicious, storable food, which lasts up to 25 years.
[03:48:39.835 --> 03:48:43.457]  Again, if nothing happens, you just eat the food and save a ton of money.
[03:48:43.457 --> 03:48:50.661]  We have the one-year supply, the six-month supply, the three-month supply, right down to a 72-hour supply.
[03:48:50.661 --> 03:48:55.184]  In fact, there's also a ready-hour one-week ammo kit as well.
[03:48:55.184 --> 03:49:03.389]  The prices compared to what you will pay on other websites and what you'll pay definitely in Europe, where I'm from, where it's basically impossible to buy this food,
[03:49:04.831 --> 03:49:07.572]  Are extremely small in comparison.
[03:49:07.572 --> 03:49:19.335]  You can see all the fantastic five-star independently certified reviews we've got there for emergency survival foods, 25-year shelf life, a bunch of different great recipes available still.
[03:49:19.335 --> 03:49:26.938]  If you can get yourself in the queue at infowarsstore.com, you may need to wait eight weeks or more in some cases.
[03:49:26.938 --> 03:49:29.158]  But again, vital to prepare the seed.
[03:49:29.158 --> 03:49:31.319]  The Global Seed Bank is stocking up
[03:49:32.116 --> 03:49:40.379]  The Department of Homeland Security put out an advisory last week encouraging people to have at least a two-week supply of food.
[03:49:40.379 --> 03:49:48.101]  So when they say, oh, you're a kook, you're a conspiracy theorist for having storable food, the federal government is literally telling you to do it.
[03:49:48.101 --> 03:49:52.362]  And that's why you've seen some panic buying in some areas of the world.
[03:49:52.362 --> 03:49:58.344]  Hopefully nothing will come of that in terms of massive delays to supplies, but you can get yourself on the list.
[03:49:59.011 --> 03:50:09.815]  For the great storable food, 25-year shelf life at infowarsstore.com right now, and you can check out the other specials on the website too.
[03:50:09.815 --> 03:50:16.278]  Now, headline on Summit.News, School in Brooklyn hands out Drag Queen in Training stickers to four-year-olds!
[03:50:16.983 --> 03:50:21.247]  Because there's nothing sexualized about drag queens, is there?
[03:50:21.247 --> 03:50:25.190]  Not as if they're literally the male version of burlesque dancers.
[03:50:25.190 --> 03:50:33.358]  Now a school in Brooklyn reportedly handed out stickers to four-year-old children during, you guessed it, a drag queen story time.
[03:50:34.637 --> 03:50:38.278]  Event that said, Drag Queen in Training.
[03:50:38.278 --> 03:50:41.460]  That's right, your four-year-old is now a drag queen in training.
[03:50:41.460 --> 03:50:48.682]  Apparently, this was done during a family day at a private school in Brooklyn.
[03:50:48.682 --> 03:50:55.645]  And yet they continue to insist that this is not sexualized, that this is not about grooming.
[03:50:55.645 --> 03:51:00.887]  By the way, one of these drag queens admitted, most people don't remember this, that it is about grooming.
[03:51:02.176 --> 03:51:07.820]  Lafayette Library Board of Control in Louisiana held a Drag Queen Storytime back in July last year.
[03:51:07.820 --> 03:51:15.965]  The drag queen, Dylan Pontiff, said this, quote, This is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[03:51:15.965 --> 03:51:17.946]  Oh, but it's not about grooming.
[03:51:17.946 --> 03:51:21.909]  We featured the story yesterday of the clip out of the UK.
[03:51:22.802 --> 03:51:26.843]  Which showed a drag queen teaching toddlers how to twerk.
[03:51:26.843 --> 03:51:31.965]  Now, try and make the argument that twerking is not a sexualized form of performance.
[03:51:31.965 --> 03:51:33.005]  Try and make that argument.
[03:51:33.005 --> 03:51:35.046]  You're going to fail.
[03:51:35.046 --> 03:51:45.109]  Last week, many drag queens, as we highlighted last week, many drag queens have engaged in sexually explicit behavior, including one here in the UK, again, called Flojob.
[03:51:45.109 --> 03:51:47.570]  That's a great idea to expose your children to a
[03:51:48.579 --> 03:51:57.802]  Individual called Flojob, who visited primary school in Scotland after posting pictures of himself on Twitter using a dildo and a ball gag.
[03:51:57.802 --> 03:52:00.522]  Oh, but it's not sexualized!
[03:52:00.522 --> 03:52:04.904]  A separate video, and these literally come out every day now.
[03:52:04.904 --> 03:52:12.746]  The course controversy last week also showed a drag queen dancing suggestively in front of a little girl while adults in the room cheered and applauded.
[03:52:12.746 --> 03:52:16.447]  You've probably all seen that by now, it's got like 7 million views on Twitter.
[03:52:18.436 --> 03:52:21.097]  And I've been documenting this for over a year.
[03:52:21.097 --> 03:52:34.359]  And in fact, in this article I flash back to some of the previous examples, including one where an admitted pedophile and convicted child porn peddler literally wrote an article on Medium.com.
[03:52:34.359 --> 03:52:37.600]  I see people being banned on Medium.com all the time.
[03:52:37.600 --> 03:52:44.601]  This convicted child porn peddler pedophile, he's still on there, of course he's still on there, wrote an article
[03:52:45.333 --> 03:52:53.136]  In which he describes Desmond is Amazing, the 12-year-old drag queen kid who is celebrated by the mass media as, quote, hot.
[03:52:53.136 --> 03:52:55.797]  Oh, but it's not sexualized.
[03:52:55.797 --> 03:53:08.142]  His mother reacted to concerns over Desmond performing at a gay nightclub in New York where attendees threw money at the child by saying, quote, I don't understand what the controversy is.
[03:53:08.757 --> 03:53:14.861]  So you've got people at a gay nightclub in New York throwing money at a child who is dancing provocatively.
[03:53:14.861 --> 03:53:19.364]  Oh, but it's not sexualized, is it?
[03:53:19.364 --> 03:53:27.689]  Of course, we had the ketamine incident with Desmond is Amazing, where he's literally on camera with other drag queens talking about sniffing ketamine.
[03:53:27.689 --> 03:53:30.110]  That's completely normal.
[03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:32.832]  One of the participants at a Drag Queen Storytime event in Houston
[03:53:33.507 --> 03:53:42.573]  Which we covered last year, 32-year-old Albert Garza later turned out to be a registered sex offender who was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[03:53:42.573 --> 03:53:46.535]  Oh, but it's not sexual!
[03:53:46.535 --> 03:53:55.081]  Meanwhile, UK Council removed transphobic flags because they displayed the dictionary definition of the word woman.
[03:53:55.081 --> 03:53:56.922]  Yes, this actually happened.
[03:53:56.922 --> 03:54:02.906]  The flags, which were flown outside Bootle and Southport town halls, were meant to celebrate International Woman's Day.
[03:54:04.133 --> 03:54:11.100]  But they featured the word woman and the dictionary definition of woman, which is, quote, an adult human female.
[03:54:11.100 --> 03:54:15.764]  We cannot have that vicious hate propaganda displayed on a flag.
[03:54:16.658 --> 03:54:36.673]  Because a Twitter user, a man, called Adrian Harrop complained that the flags were, quote, a transphobic dog whistle and the offending items were removed and then the council prostrated itself on Twitter, caved in and apologised because one frigging idiot complained.
[03:54:36.673 --> 03:54:42.798]  We have been made aware of a potential issue regarding the messaging on a flag flown at Bootle and Southport town halls and have taken them down.
[03:54:43.601 --> 03:54:49.028]  We have a proud history of supporting LGBTQ blah blah blah blah blah.
[03:54:49.028 --> 03:54:53.714]  Another Twitter user called Isa, who first drew attention to this story, tweeted, This isn't a joke.
[03:54:53.714 --> 03:54:54.756]  I'm not exaggerating this in any way.
[03:54:54.756 --> 03:54:56.097]  This is literally what they are saying here.
[03:55:02.771 --> 03:55:04.133]  This was the offensive flag.
[03:55:04.133 --> 03:55:06.896]  They took these flags down because they were seen as offensive.
[03:55:06.896 --> 03:55:20.972]  And of course, you have the added irony on International Women's Day of these flags, which merely state the definition of the word woman being removed because of a single complaint by a man.
[03:55:23.302 --> 03:55:35.527]  I point out in the article in George Orwell's 1984, the Newspeak dictionary shrank in size year after year in order to eliminate language and limit free thought and free speech, making it harder for the plebs to vocalise their opposition to the party.
[03:55:35.527 --> 03:55:45.172]  Because if now you can't even say there are only two genders, and literally proclaim the dictionary definition of the word woman, what can you say?
[03:55:45.172 --> 03:55:48.033]  They control language, they control thought.
[03:55:49.167 --> 03:56:01.152]  Presumably, every dictionary that includes a proper definition of the word woman will now have to be revised and all old copies burned, because that's progress!
[03:56:01.152 --> 03:56:08.194]  Also in the UK, a woman rushed into gender reassignment as a teen is now suing the NHS.
[03:56:08.194 --> 03:56:15.497]  A woman given transgender reassignment therapy as a teen is suing the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust for having rushed her into the treatment.
[03:56:16.041 --> 03:56:36.837]  Of course, I pointed out many times before, the cases of children being given hormone treatment, being given transgender therapy, skyrocketed from 2010 to 2018 to 2019, from just a handful of cases, I think it was like two dozen cases in total, to literally around 3,000.
[03:56:36.837 --> 03:56:43.102]  Now, did that spike, did that percentage spike, which is in the thousands of percentile,
[03:56:43.783 --> 03:56:51.507]  Occur because of children genuinely identifying as transgender and that being a real scientific thing?
[03:56:51.507 --> 03:56:58.210]  Or did it occur because of how the media and the culture normalized it in the period from 2010 to 2018?
[03:56:58.210 --> 03:57:00.831]  Gee I wonder!
[03:57:00.831 --> 03:57:12.377]  Now this individual who's rushed into treatment is suing the hospital because as we know transgender people both before and after treatment, both before and after operations, have
[03:57:13.001 --> 03:57:25.246]  The same suicide rates, or some data shows, increased suicide rates because it's a mental illness and it's not going to be corrected by mutilating somebody's sexual organs.
[03:57:25.246 --> 03:57:26.986]  So that's what's happening in the UK.
[03:57:26.986 --> 03:57:38.651]  Drag queens twerking in front of children, councils removing flags that state the definition of the word woman, and people being rushed into transgender surgery and now suing the NHS.
[03:57:38.651 --> 03:57:40.252]  Welcome to Clown World.
[03:57:40.252 --> 03:57:40.792]  Don't go away.
