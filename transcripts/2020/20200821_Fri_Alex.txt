[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:04.831]  I went and reviewed this morning and last night what they're putting on TV for kids, man.
[00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:06.772]  And I can't handle it.
[00:00:07.652 --> 00:00:08.973]  I mean, I want to start killing people.
[00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:11.194]  I'm going to be... I can't... Get it off the screen!
[00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:13.715]  I'm not kidding around, folks.
[00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:14.675]  I'm at my breaking point.
[00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:27.774]  Because there's a certain Satanism to this, that they just normalize it, where now it's out in the open, and now we talk about it, and they don't even get in trouble, and we do!
[00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:30.955]  I can't handle these people, man!
[00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:35.417]  They got our kids, they're ruining their lives, and they're laughing at us!
[00:00:37.278 --> 00:00:42.960]  And it's not normal to come up here and make it an outrage that we just talk about what they're doing!
[00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:45.681]  I can't look at it!
[00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:46.702]  Because you know what?
[00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:52.993]  We know what they did to the little kid once they took him in there and they show you on TV what they did.
[00:00:55.894 --> 00:00:58.514]  Adults can't handle looking at these crime videos.
[00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:02.615]  Police can't handle it and they do it out in the open.
[00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:13.678]  But then I look at people who won't even look at this and won't even speak out against it and I hate you more than the devil worshipping pedophiles because you can stop it!
[00:01:16.923 --> 00:01:17.503]  But you don't.
[00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:23.665]  So... I don't like the collapse that's coming.
[00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:25.646]  Because I know it's not going to be fun.
[00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:26.526]  But you know what?
[00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:27.586]  We all deserve it.
[00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:46.512]  And so all of you that have been on the fence, that think all this Satanism is funny, and think going along with it's funny, and think you're powerful because you don't care, you think you're strong because you don't care about anybody, and you've got your little world, and that's all you care about, your little empty plastic world is going to be destroyed!
[00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:52.096]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.304]  You are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.
[00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:06.768]  Does that sound like something you are behind?
[00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:11.432]  Well, I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?
[00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:19.619]  Marina Abramovic is a superstar with every weird, twisted, Hollywood, D.C.
[00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.080]  or New York lowlife.
[00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:25.343]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:29.732]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:39.786]  Maxwell participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting his sex trafficking ring, ensuring that approximately three girls a day were made available to him.
[00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:40.827]  Human smuggling.
[00:02:40.847 --> 00:02:42.570]  People think of that as an ancient
[00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.213]  There are more human smugglers right now, traffickers, that go than at any time in the history of our world.
[00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:53.235]  Trump has signed executive orders to expand interdiction of human trafficking.
[00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:54.095]  It's exploded.
[00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.776]  He's got the Navy and the Army involved stopping it.
[00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:59.477]  And they're having huge bust of small children kidnapped.
[00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:03.819]  Operation Cross Country led to the arrest of 120 human traffickers.
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.301]  One of the victims was just three months old.
[00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:06.901]  124 arrests.
[00:03:10.262 --> 00:03:13.464]  339 criminal arrests were made across the state.
[00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:16.986]  84 underage boys and girls forced into prostitution.
[00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:23.369]  Sarasota deputies have announced the arrest of 25 people accused of traveling to have sex with a child.
[00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:27.992]  Tonight, more than half a dozen accused child sexual predators are off the street.
[00:03:28.112 --> 00:03:31.614]  One trafficker was arrested after making a deal with an undercover agent.
[00:03:32.314 --> 00:03:36.176]  To sell a three-month-old girl and her five-year-old sister for sex.
[00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.637]  Human sex trafficking of juveniles.
[00:03:38.877 --> 00:03:47.020]  I am prepared to bring the full force and weight of our government that we can do in order to solve this horrific problem.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:55.343]  The whole Clinton system is just littered with pedophiles and Tony Podesta running, you know, full-page articles about how he loves art of naked children.
[00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.844]  They're throwing it in our face.
[00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.211]  It's Friday, August 21st.
[00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:09.372]  The year is 2020.
[00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:14.735]  We're taking the gloves off of the Deep State and their satanic pedophile networks.
[00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:20.639]  That house of cards is coming down, but the enemy is striking back.
[00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:31.925]  Now that we've drugged them from the darkness into the light of high noon, they're attempting to collapse the world economy and create religious and race war to distract from their crimes.
[00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:33.967]  It will not work.
[00:04:34.747 --> 00:04:36.008]  It will not happen.
[00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:45.263]  You know, I started making a film a few months ago about Bill Gates and COVID-19, and it's ending up being a film about the Shadow Network and Jeffrey Epstein, because that's where it leads back to.
[00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:46.984]  And of course, Bill Gates is involved.
[00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:54.190]  They're not just raping children, they're poisoning them with tainted vaccines, they're keeping them alive after they're aborted.
[00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.376]  It's a whole system based on murdering and killing and diseasing and absolutely torturing our most defenseless.
[00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:08.299]  And going through all these clips, I have all the clips from five years ago, four years ago, three years ago.
[00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.239]  There's no such thing as pedophilia.
[00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:12.160]  There's no networks of pedophiles.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.300]  There's no kids kidnapped.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.600]  There's no sex slavery.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.961]  I went back and researched it.
[00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:25.002]  The UN is a giant child and kidnapped woman sex trafficking operation.
[00:05:25.022 --> 00:05:27.023]  There's a big story at nationalfile.com.
[00:05:27.063 --> 00:05:32.984]  It's also on infowars.com, where they're making a big deal about all these shows that sexualize 10-year-old girls.
[00:05:34.414 --> 00:05:37.357]  My God, they have programs because, you know, be tough for little boys.
[00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:47.906]  They can take it with these vampire-like men dressed up like women leading the children in and saying, oh, this kid's a top.
[00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:53.411]  That means he's pitching and, oh, we're going to have 10-year-old boys having sex.
[00:05:54.517 --> 00:05:56.418]  With other boys that call themselves women.
[00:05:56.718 --> 00:06:05.423]  Just out in the open, on TV, the dungeon keepers leading the children in drag queen story time.
[00:06:07.184 --> 00:06:12.547]  And this is their total, full, out of control assault.
[00:06:14.411 --> 00:06:15.952]  Now that's a short video we just put out.
[00:06:15.972 --> 00:06:20.394]  We're going to put a longer one out that has even more of the information in it at Band.Video.
[00:06:20.834 --> 00:06:28.238]  Roger Stone's got big breaking news on why the Bannon indictment is so important and a bunch of other breaking political news at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:29.199]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:06:30.694 --> 00:06:34.235]  And then we've got other special guests coming up today and a ton of news.
[00:06:34.915 --> 00:06:39.656]  So much more to cover and the whole COVID brainwashing straitjacket going on even tighter.
[00:06:40.016 --> 00:06:43.997]  It's all coming up on this live August 21st Global Transmission.
[00:06:44.677 --> 00:06:45.938]  What happened to Joe Biden?
[00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:52.639]  We first pointed it out two years ago that overnight he went from being an eloquent speaker to not being able to form a single sentence.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.900]  It was the reason I was banned again from Facebook.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.561]  They said not even a common
[00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.491]  A mention can be positive.
[00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:02.951]  He will be banned as well.
[00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:12.634]  We were honored because we knew in the test of time he would become completely delirious and we would be proven right again and it's happened.
[00:07:13.094 --> 00:07:19.337]  Here is some of the new ads that Trump's putting out on this issue and the crime wave on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:07:24.078 --> 00:07:24.578]  He went.
[00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:26.439]  He went.
[00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.539]  He became president.
[00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:29.320]  I didn't go and I'm still vice president.
[00:07:31.773 --> 00:07:42.721]  And, uh, in addition to that, uh, in addition to that, we have to, uh, make sure that we, uh, we are in a position that we are... Think about it.
[00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:49.887]  Everybody has known from day one how smart, how bright Hillary is.
[00:07:50.147 --> 00:07:53.069]  Everybody knows how tough she is.
[00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.894]  You know, the rapidly rising, uh, um, uh, in with, uh,
[00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.871]  With, uh, I don't know.
[00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:05.632]  So be successful!
[00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:09.593]  I sincerely hope some of you become millionaires and billionaires.
[00:08:09.894 --> 00:08:10.474]  I mean that.
[00:08:11.774 --> 00:08:12.695]  But engage!
[00:08:13.475 --> 00:08:26.821]  Um, you know, there's a, uh, during World War II, uh, you know, where Roosevelt came up with a thing, uh, that, uh, you know, was totally different than a, than the, the, he called it the, you know,
[00:08:39.495 --> 00:08:40.956]  Commander-in-Chief.
[00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:42.676]  It's more than just a job.
[00:08:43.116 --> 00:08:55.380]  Since taking office, President Donald Trump has rebuilt our military, repaired a broken VA, and eliminated Soleimani, al-Baghdadi, ISIS, the world's deadliest terrorists, brought to justice.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.161]  Today, America is safer and stronger than ever.
[00:08:59.621 --> 00:09:02.422]  Because to President Trump, it's more than just a job.
[00:09:02.822 --> 00:09:06.243]  It's a sworn duty to keep America safe.
[00:09:06.803 --> 00:09:08.944]  I'm Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message.
[00:09:13.811 --> 00:09:17.948]  They wrecked their force at peaceful protestors.
[00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:21.651]  The vast majority of the protest has been peaceful.
[00:09:21.951 --> 00:09:28.055]  And they're going and just pulling people off the street to make it seem like there are problems going on, when all that's happening are peaceful protests.
[00:09:28.175 --> 00:09:31.777]  And our peaceful protestors' ability to get out at night.
[00:09:32.218 --> 00:09:33.759]  Most of these protests have been peaceful.
[00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:35.980]  I applaud these protestors.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.162]  The majority of these protestors are peaceful.
[00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:39.663]  They have been peaceful for weeks.
[00:09:40.103 --> 00:09:42.985]  It has continued, for the most part, peaceful.
[00:09:43.005 --> 00:09:44.005]  It was peaceful.
[00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:45.807]  We had a number of peaceful protests.
[00:09:55.071 --> 00:10:17.967]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are hundreds of videos coming in, we can't even watch them all, of people going into working class, middle class, and rich neighborhoods and screaming, we're going to take your house, we're going to kill you, we're going to burn your house down.
[00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.431]  And it goes on.
[00:10:23.732 --> 00:10:25.293]  And on and on.
[00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:32.695]  And there's footage of Joe Biden supporters stealing a seven-year-old boy's mega hat and attacking his mother.
[00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:36.676]  There's that footage.
[00:10:39.977 --> 00:10:41.218]  These are women.
[00:10:44.258 --> 00:10:45.119]  Attacking other women.
[00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:45.819]  Get off my property?
[00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:46.880]  Get off my property?
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:47.781]  Are you destroying my property?
[00:10:47.801 --> 00:10:48.161]  Yes, we are.
[00:10:48.341 --> 00:10:49.702]  You know that's a felony?
[00:10:49.722 --> 00:10:54.306]  These are women attacking a mother and her child that have pro-Trump signs.
[00:10:54.586 --> 00:10:55.147]  Get it, Liv.
[00:10:55.227 --> 00:10:55.747]  Get it.
[00:10:55.787 --> 00:10:57.269]  Touch my heart.
[00:10:57.849 --> 00:10:58.510]  Now they punch her.
[00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.594]  We've got to have more demonstrations with Trump signs and info war signs.
[00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:05.215]  Get your hat back, baby.
[00:11:05.235 --> 00:11:07.717]  They just attacked a little girl.
[00:11:07.757 --> 00:11:08.658]  Get your hat back, baby.
[00:11:08.678 --> 00:11:09.638]  Get your hat back, baby.
[00:11:09.659 --> 00:11:12.661]  I want to give this lady a job.
[00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:13.622]  I like the fact that they're
[00:11:15.062 --> 00:11:16.083]  Give me back my hat.
[00:11:16.663 --> 00:11:17.564]  Give me back my hat.
[00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:19.065]  Give me back my hat.
[00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.346]  Give me back my hat.
[00:11:20.906 --> 00:11:22.427]  Give me back my hat.
[00:11:22.968 --> 00:11:24.168]  Give me back my hat.
[00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:25.349]  Give me back my hat.
[00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:26.770]  I'm telling you right now.
[00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.251]  You're gonna steal my property?
[00:11:28.732 --> 00:11:30.713]  I'll follow you to your car and get your license plate.
[00:11:31.433 --> 00:11:34.095]  Tell you what, you slap my kid in the head, you're gonna get your job broken.
[00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:36.997]  Then you're gonna get lucky if your head doesn't start bouncing off concrete.
[00:11:37.017 --> 00:11:38.338]  I don't care if you're a man or a woman.
[00:11:38.418 --> 00:11:38.718]  Taylor!
[00:11:38.758 --> 00:11:38.958]  Taylor!
[00:11:38.978 --> 00:11:40.679]  These people right here are taking your hat!
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.621]  They attacked my son!
[00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:48.438]  Everybody should just beat their ass for that, man.
[00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.599]  Trash.
[00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:51.780]  Smack.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.862]  That's why they attack women, though.
[00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:54.762]  Women attack women.
[00:11:55.263 --> 00:11:56.023]  Men attack women.
[00:11:56.263 --> 00:11:57.424]  Because the left are cowards.
[00:11:58.445 --> 00:12:00.826]  They have no empathy.
[00:12:00.906 --> 00:12:04.368]  No reality.
[00:12:04.448 --> 00:12:04.929]  I like this.
[00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:06.109]  Yeah, look at this.
[00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.851]  Men trying to take the back peacefully.
[00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:08.531]  She's attacking them.
[00:12:09.051 --> 00:12:10.252]  Knock her upside the head, man.
[00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:11.113]  She's in a man's world.
[00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:14.970]  These are the weak-minded people, folks.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.900]  I'm not trying to hit you!
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.301]  I'm not trying to bite you!
[00:12:40.341 --> 00:12:41.721]  You're coming after me!
[00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:42.761]  I'm not afraid of you!
[00:12:42.781 --> 00:12:44.762]  I'm not afraid of you!
[00:12:44.882 --> 00:12:45.862]  I'm not afraid of you!
[00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:47.042]  She came after my son!
[00:12:47.322 --> 00:12:48.122]  I have it on video!
[00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:49.543]  She came after my son!
[00:12:49.563 --> 00:12:51.423]  You notice they attacked a child.
[00:12:51.543 --> 00:12:52.783]  Now she's attacking again.
[00:12:53.663 --> 00:12:56.144]  And they punch him and then say they're not punching.
[00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:00.425]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[00:13:03.125 --> 00:13:05.726]  This is the globalist project to collapse the country.
[00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:12.385]  And even Call of Duty's come out with a new video about it, pointing out that it was what the Soviets tried to do here.
[00:13:12.405 --> 00:13:14.526]  We have to understand the globalists had already taken over Russia.
[00:13:15.366 --> 00:13:16.706]  So it's not the Russians that did it.
[00:13:16.726 --> 00:13:17.787]  It's not about defending Russians.
[00:13:17.847 --> 00:13:25.009]  If the Russians did it, if the Russians, I'm not going to say they're not that smart, but if the Russians did this, I'd blame the Russians.
[00:13:25.689 --> 00:13:32.091]  It was the globalists, the proto-left, that overthrew Russia and did to them what they're trying to do here.
[00:13:33.052 --> 00:13:33.432]  Period.
[00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:41.634]  They couldn't get the Russians to break up their families, they couldn't get the Russians to do as much as they've gotten us to do, I'll be honest with you.
[00:13:42.094 --> 00:13:47.457]  And so the Russians have an understanding of this now, and it's why the Hollywood trash and the New World Order is so upset.
[00:13:48.057 --> 00:13:49.038]  Because if the U.S.
[00:13:49.098 --> 00:13:53.540]  and Russia get together, like General Flynn wanted us to do against the New World Order, it's over for them!
[00:13:56.362 --> 00:13:58.523]  And Russia knows that as well.
[00:14:00.664 --> 00:14:01.745]  Russia actually approached
[00:14:04.073 --> 00:14:04.533]  And the U.S.
[00:14:04.573 --> 00:14:09.175]  approached Russia back in the 60s and 70s about a secret nuclear strike on China.
[00:14:10.256 --> 00:14:11.756]  And Russia refused it once, the U.S.
[00:14:11.776 --> 00:14:12.637]  refused it the next time.
[00:14:12.657 --> 00:14:15.998]  And there was that same geopolitical strategy, like, China's going to be the issue.
[00:14:16.499 --> 00:14:17.219]  Let's not do this.
[00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:18.940]  Let's just annihilate the Communists there.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.321]  Russia is not really working with China.
[00:14:22.141 --> 00:14:23.702]  And of course, that deal never came through.
[00:14:23.742 --> 00:14:25.603]  I don't want to have a nuclear strike on China.
[00:14:25.963 --> 00:14:28.744]  But people knew then China was going to be set up to take over.
[00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:30.125]  And it is.
[00:14:31.178 --> 00:14:32.078]  And so that's where we are.
[00:14:32.298 --> 00:14:35.040]  And while we're busy fighting with Russia, this whole thing's going down.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.360]  Well, that's coming up next segment.
[00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:42.562]  And just the mask news and what's coming out of it is so incredible.
[00:14:42.663 --> 00:14:52.887]  I have seen text messages with the second most high person in government in Hawaii, and I'm trying to get authorization to show these, and I've confirmed that's who it's with.
[00:14:54.209 --> 00:15:00.051]  You know, we have some guests and people on the show that are big film producers and have lived in Hawaii, and they've talked to these folks.
[00:15:00.912 --> 00:15:02.792]  And they said, hey, you know, why are you complaining?
[00:15:03.573 --> 00:15:10.155]  We're going to start the inoculations by this year or next year, and if you don't have a shot, you're not leaving your house.
[00:15:11.836 --> 00:15:13.116]  They're already saying that in Australia.
[00:15:13.156 --> 00:15:13.596]  That's coming.
[00:15:14.297 --> 00:15:16.197]  So this is all UN-directed, folks.
[00:15:16.237 --> 00:15:23.320]  And if they can get you to wear a mask and get you to carry a phone to be contact traced, they know you'll do anything.
[00:15:24.977 --> 00:15:26.418]  And that is the forced inoculation.
[00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:32.820]  Then you'll have it on your phone that you've got it, and you swipe, that you are digitally taking your Bill Gates shots.
[00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:39.143]  And you're gonna see a good 20-30% of the public do it, and they're gonna tell you, you're not getting on airplanes, none of it.
[00:15:39.463 --> 00:15:44.325]  JetBlue stands by, throwing the people off the plane for saying the two-year-old had to put a mask on.
[00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:51.148]  This is a corporate cult, and now the universities everywhere are announcing
[00:15:53.163 --> 00:15:53.563]  Everywhere.
[00:15:54.764 --> 00:16:04.789]  That you're going to have a phone with an app on it that says where you go, and if you leave the college campus, you're expelled or suspended.
[00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.110]  And it also tells you what stores you can go to.
[00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:11.153]  And you get money credits, though, discounts for complying.
[00:16:11.733 --> 00:16:12.834]  It is the social score.
[00:16:13.634 --> 00:16:15.015]  It's already here.
[00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:16.796]  And it's all coming up.
[00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:18.837]  Whether you believe in the Bible or not,
[00:16:19.872 --> 00:16:28.600]  There's a tyrannical anti-human world government that wants to phase humans out and is building a new AI life form it believes that will replace us, an alien life form.
[00:16:28.981 --> 00:16:30.722]  That's the official cosmology of the globalist.
[00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:36.908]  And they're bringing in a system to buy and sell where you must submit to them and your orderly extermination.
[00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.271]  And you know who else is live?
[00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.133]  It's President Trump in Arlington, Virginia.
[00:16:41.153 --> 00:16:45.937]  We paused it a few minutes ago because he was on fire talking about the double standard for Joe Biden.
[00:16:46.197 --> 00:16:48.619]  He can hide under a rock, his wife goes out and speaks for him.
[00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:50.681]  Now he can't even form a single sentence.
[00:16:51.001 --> 00:16:52.462]  The decline is accelerating.
[00:16:52.502 --> 00:16:58.587]  At this rate, I said this two years ago, I believe he won't be able to basically talk by the inauguration if he actually won.
[00:16:58.887 --> 00:16:59.808]  But that's their plan.
[00:17:00.068 --> 00:17:02.030]  So he steps down and in comes Kamala Harris.
[00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.232]  Here's what the President's saying as we speak.
[00:17:05.273 --> 00:17:06.274]  I will say that if
[00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:14.343]  A Republican ever did what Joe Biden did with calling off the prosecutors or you're not going to get a billion dollars?
[00:17:15.524 --> 00:17:16.304]  And he's on tape.
[00:17:16.404 --> 00:17:18.346]  It's not like, oh, gee, I mean, he's on tape.
[00:17:19.642 --> 00:17:20.922]  We wouldn't have had a chance.
[00:17:21.282 --> 00:17:22.142]  It's a disgrace.
[00:17:22.422 --> 00:17:24.263]  The double standard is a disgrace.
[00:17:25.163 --> 00:17:27.403]  And hopefully it'll be brought back to fairness.
[00:17:28.163 --> 00:17:31.664]  And remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught.
[00:17:32.404 --> 00:17:33.724]  They can say what they want.
[00:17:33.784 --> 00:17:40.626]  This FBI agent has just now, first one, admitted that's the beginning, hopefully, of the falling castle.
[00:17:41.506 --> 00:17:44.806]  But he's admitted that he forged documents.
[00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:48.027]  He changed documents, reversing them.
[00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:50.122]  And he admitted it.
[00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:57.708]  So, let's see what's going to happen over the next hopefully short period of time, because it's been unfair that we've had to wait so long.
[00:17:57.788 --> 00:17:59.589]  That was so obvious for a long time.
[00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.874]  And it should never be allowed to happen to another president again, that I can tell you.
[00:18:06.775 --> 00:18:08.656]  And that's for the good of the country.
[00:18:08.676 --> 00:18:13.320]  Not for me, for the good of the country.
[00:18:15.188 --> 00:18:23.813]  We replaced NAFTA, which everybody said was impossible to do, with the brand new and really pro-America USMCA.
[00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.174]  It's a whole different ballgame.
[00:18:26.115 --> 00:18:29.337]  And we don't want to lose our companies to Mexico and Canada.
[00:18:30.097 --> 00:18:33.219]  And this puts a tremendous price tag on doing that.
[00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:35.021]  If they want to do that, they won't be doing that.
[00:18:35.561 --> 00:18:41.365]  In everything we do, my administration is fighting for the American people and delivering one victory after another.
[00:18:42.284 --> 00:18:44.806]  We have appointed more than 230 federal judges.
[00:18:44.826 --> 00:18:47.388]  We expect to be perhaps over 300 federal judges by the end of the year.
[00:19:12.723 --> 00:19:14.744]  Oh, the globalists are scared right now.
[00:19:16.045 --> 00:19:19.227]  Their Chai Combat plan to take down the country is failing.
[00:19:19.247 --> 00:19:22.689]  And now everything we covered...
[00:19:23.936 --> 00:19:25.638]  Like Yuri Bezmenov.
[00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:28.220]  I covered this guy 25 years ago.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.665]  I was playing his former high-level KGB officer's breakdown of the left.
[00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:34.286]  They're planning to demoralize us.
[00:19:34.366 --> 00:19:36.649]  And we got the Saul Alinsky book confirms all of it.
[00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:43.255]  And it's the billionaires, almost all of them together, running it because they want to end the free market so you're a slave.
[00:19:43.976 --> 00:20:05.744]  They get all the money and then they want to bankrupt everybody so they get all your property and whatever's left and then most importantly can dictate culturally what they want and that's Netflix now showing men dressed as women leading young boys with their clothes off or scantily clad into sex dungeons.
[00:20:07.967 --> 00:20:10.949]  And Netflix is defending it and saying they stand by it.
[00:20:11.629 --> 00:20:14.051]  Now people are upset about 10, 11 year old girls twerking.
[00:20:15.171 --> 00:20:18.633]  And a show about how they're sexy and sexualizing them for the pedo viewer.
[00:20:19.774 --> 00:20:25.678]  But now, oh, the little boys are even younger and they're, oh, they're being, let me bring this little boy into a homosexual sex dungeon.
[00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:27.379]  He's a top.
[00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:34.663]  They tell you he's going to go into this sex room on some dirty mattress and he likes to, he, he likes to do the pitching.
[00:20:36.786 --> 00:20:45.968]  With a leering demon, a man in a clown outfit, calling himself a woman, a man stealing a woman's identity to commit these crimes against God.
[00:20:47.369 --> 00:20:53.010]  And leering and smiling all the way into your child's soul.
[00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.291]  It's only Drag Queen Storytime!
[00:20:56.371 --> 00:20:56.951]  Come on!
[00:20:58.283 --> 00:21:07.568]  Men with erections and little girls and boys bouncing on them, with men sharking out like, like, like, like, like fiends from some nightmare.
[00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:16.633]  But here's the former KGB operative, defector, now Call of Duty black ops, this is the new ad.
[00:21:17.593 --> 00:21:19.154]  And I'll narrate for radio listeners, here it is.
[00:21:24.744 --> 00:21:28.367]  At the height of the Cold War, KGB defector issued a chilling warning.
[00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:34.030]  Understand what's going on around you.
[00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.371]  You are in a state of war.
[00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:39.254]  And you have precious little time to save yourself.
[00:21:39.334 --> 00:21:48.741]  And again it lays out the plan to subvert U.S.
[00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:50.382]  vs. Soviet dominance in the arms race.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.542]  To this day, identity and whereabouts remain unknown to this quote operative.
[00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:00.705]  It's a slow process which we call active measures.
[00:22:02.626 --> 00:22:04.747]  The first stage being demoralization.
[00:22:06.088 --> 00:22:09.110]  It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation.
[00:22:10.591 --> 00:22:12.492]  The next stage is destabilization.
[00:22:13.733 --> 00:22:15.094]  What matters is essentials.
[00:22:15.654 --> 00:22:18.416]  Economy, foreign relations,
[00:22:19.531 --> 00:22:20.572]  Inspired by actual events,
[00:22:57.856 --> 00:23:08.063]  So again, if you don't want to be doomed to repeat it, understand that this is coming out, they probably got it by the censors who were too old and didn't understand.
[00:23:08.263 --> 00:23:09.564]  Oh great, it's blaming Russians.
[00:23:09.624 --> 00:23:18.491]  No, this is clearly showing you what's happening currently, and it's the globalist hand that did this to Russia, and then Russia would use this to exploit and overthrow other countries.
[00:23:18.811 --> 00:23:25.516]  Because once a country is taken down by communists, which really is just the political name of the Illuminists, it's the system the slaves are under.
[00:23:25.536 --> 00:23:26.897]  It's not what it is on top.
[00:23:27.617 --> 00:23:35.730]  They then exploit the country to start the next round of the infiltration, the destabilization, the normalization.
[00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.152]  But see, here's the key.
[00:23:37.693 --> 00:23:42.420]  They never got full control here during the normalization once they take over.
[00:23:43.527 --> 00:23:49.830]  The normalization that you're a slave, the normalization you don't have food, the normalization you don't have water, the normalization of troop on the streets.
[00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:56.053]  They put the government into that crisis so that once they get control it's already in place and they can blame it on that.
[00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:58.514]  But they never fully got to that point.
[00:24:00.384 --> 00:24:08.027]  Because there's still elements of the government and the population and corporations and churches and individuals, that's key, that aren't complying and get it!
[00:24:08.727 --> 00:24:13.549]  And so there's a civil war, politically, economically, culturally, about this destiny.
[00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.572]  Yuri Beznamov in new trailer for Black Ops, Cold War, Information Liberation.
[00:24:21.612 --> 00:24:23.772]  It's posted on Infowars.com as well.
[00:24:25.273 --> 00:24:26.833]  We'll post that trailer at Bandot Video.
[00:24:26.874 --> 00:24:27.334]  It's important.
[00:24:27.354 --> 00:24:27.894]  We should run it.
[00:24:29.056 --> 00:24:35.958]  As a promo for them, but we should also take a few minutes of what I've said here and put it interspersed with it so people understand.
[00:24:36.258 --> 00:24:37.878]  And it's not about giving the Russians a pass.
[00:24:38.418 --> 00:24:42.119]  If you believe the Russians cooked this up, you're ignoring history on record.
[00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:45.120]  Who overthrew Russia in 1917?
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:46.881]  The Bolsheviks.
[00:24:46.901 --> 00:24:47.581]  Where'd they come from?
[00:24:47.801 --> 00:24:48.681]  The United States and England.
[00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:50.421]  What did they do?
[00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:52.142]  How long did it take them to take control of Russia?
[00:24:52.442 --> 00:24:53.582]  At least five years.
[00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:56.523]  What'd they do once they got control of the central government?
[00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.231]  I'll tell you later in the second hour about it.
[00:24:59.551 --> 00:25:00.812]  First up, Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:25:00.952 --> 00:25:02.973]  But you gotta know history or you're doomed to repeat it.
[00:25:03.273 --> 00:25:04.454]  We know the enemy!
[00:25:04.814 --> 00:25:05.934]  We know the playbook!
[00:25:06.435 --> 00:25:08.236]  And we are gonna kick their ass!
[00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.611]  The pedophile networks.
[00:25:31.912 --> 00:25:32.972]  It's so important, here it is.
[00:25:34.473 --> 00:25:40.877]  You are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.
[00:25:40.997 --> 00:25:45.319]  Does that sound like something you are behind?
[00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:49.982]  Well, I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?
[00:25:51.104 --> 00:25:58.167]  Marina Abramovic is a superstar with every weird, twisted, Hollywood, D.C.
[00:25:58.227 --> 00:25:59.427]  or New York love life.
[00:26:01.028 --> 00:26:03.889]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[00:26:05.595 --> 00:26:08.256]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[00:26:08.396 --> 00:26:18.321]  Maxwell participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting his sex trafficking ring, ensuring that approximately three girls a day were made available to him.
[00:26:18.421 --> 00:26:19.362]  Human smuggling.
[00:26:19.382 --> 00:26:21.843]  People think of that as an ancient art.
[00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:27.726]  There are more human smugglers right now, traffickers they call them, than at any time in the history of our world.
[00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:31.790]  Trump has signed executive orders to expand interdiction of human trafficking.
[00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:32.651]  It's exploded.
[00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.333]  He's got the Navy and the Army involved stopping it.
[00:26:35.393 --> 00:26:38.056]  And they're having huge busts of small children kidnapped.
[00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:42.400]  Operation Cross-Country led to the arrest of 120 human traffickers.
[00:26:42.581 --> 00:26:44.883]  One of the victims was just three months old.
[00:26:44.923 --> 00:26:45.463]  124 arrests.
[00:26:48.827 --> 00:26:52.010]  339 criminal arrests were made across the state.
[00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.554]  84 underage boys and girls forced into prostitution.
[00:26:55.574 --> 00:27:01.960]  Sarasota deputies have announced the arrest of 25 people accused of traveling to have sex with a child.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.565]  Tonight, more than half a dozen accused child sexual predators are off the street.
[00:27:06.685 --> 00:27:10.189]  One trafficker was arrested after making a deal with an undercover agent.
[00:27:10.869 --> 00:27:14.770]  To sell a three-month-old girl and her five-year-old sister for sex.
[00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.191]  Human sex trafficking of juveniles.
[00:27:17.451 --> 00:27:25.613]  I am prepared to bring the full force and weight of our government that we can do in order to solve this horrific problem.
[00:27:25.953 --> 00:27:33.895]  The whole Clinton system is just littered with pedophiles and Tony Podesta running, you know, full-page articles about how he loves art of naked children.
[00:27:33.996 --> 00:27:35.396]  They're throwing it in our face.
[00:27:42.398 --> 00:27:44.219]  It's a very important short report.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.081]  It's not a campaign ad for Trump.
[00:27:47.121 --> 00:27:50.043]  It's an ad for truth for the children.
[00:27:50.503 --> 00:27:52.865]  Trump unleashes hell on child sex traffickers.
[00:27:53.125 --> 00:27:54.186]  We're going to add to that posting.
[00:27:54.546 --> 00:27:56.047]  Paul Watson's video from a few years ago.
[00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:57.988]  Pedophiles rule the world.
[00:27:58.609 --> 00:28:02.351]  But their empire of evil is going down.
[00:28:02.471 --> 00:28:03.612]  Share that link.
[00:28:03.652 --> 00:28:04.592]  Went up late last night.
[00:28:04.612 --> 00:28:05.353]  114,000 views.
[00:28:05.413 --> 00:28:06.794]  It needs 10 million views.
[00:28:08.675 --> 00:28:12.317]  Well, Roger Stone joins us, and I appreciate him because he's a man of demand and very, very busy.
[00:28:12.758 --> 00:28:14.899]  I wanted to get his take on the Bannon situation.
[00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:19.702]  It's bigger than just Steve Bannon perjuring himself and saying Stone was the Wicked League's connection.
[00:28:20.362 --> 00:28:26.206]  This ties into a bunch of things, and what's happening, he's got campaign news and a lot more.
[00:28:26.226 --> 00:28:28.627]  So, Roger Stone, thank you for coming on with us today.
[00:28:29.588 --> 00:28:31.589]  Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[00:28:32.522 --> 00:28:57.061]  I must say at the top that I take no delight in Steve Bannon's new problems, but they don't surprise me, because we know definitively that he directly contradicted his testimony at my trial, where he was Robert Mueller's top witness, his big secret witness, in his sworn testimony to the House Intelligence Committee.
[00:28:57.942 --> 00:29:03.926]  In fact, it was so egregious and so obvious, the New York Post reported on it.
[00:29:04.987 --> 00:29:06.408]  You can't have it both ways.
[00:29:06.468 --> 00:29:13.174]  He told the House Intelligence Committee that he never spoke to me about WikiLeaks or Julian Assange at any time ever.
[00:29:13.554 --> 00:29:14.715]  That is the truth, by the way.
[00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:23.376]  And then basically on the stand, sealing my guilty verdict, he said, no, we spoke about it in every conversation we had in 2016.
[00:29:24.216 --> 00:29:24.837]  Not true.
[00:29:25.757 --> 00:29:27.658]  So this does not surprise me.
[00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:38.945]  What does surprise me is that in my trial, the government had an obligation to tell us that Steve Bannon, their chief witness, was under federal investigation.
[00:29:39.405 --> 00:29:42.107]  Not doing so is a Brady violation.
[00:29:42.891 --> 00:29:51.134]  It's not that Bannon's federal investigation was exculpatory, but we could have used it to impeach his credibility.
[00:29:51.854 --> 00:29:59.037]  Did Steve try to make a deal on this criminal charge and throw me to the wolves in return?
[00:29:59.237 --> 00:30:02.979]  I'll never know, but I'm praying for him at this point.
[00:30:04.299 --> 00:30:11.163]  I point out that the Ten Commandments tell us, they shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
[00:30:11.784 --> 00:30:16.646]  And the Bible teaches us to pray for those who have trespassed against us.
[00:30:16.686 --> 00:30:18.708]  And vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.
[00:30:19.248 --> 00:30:23.470]  And here he is, groveling, lying, working with the system, leaking on Trump.
[00:30:24.151 --> 00:30:27.373]  And now the very people, as I'm told, I talk to high-level folks in New York,
[00:30:28.013 --> 00:30:32.156]  Yesterday morning they said no, this is the Deep State Democrats trying to embarrass Trump.
[00:30:32.496 --> 00:30:35.618]  So now the Deep State's doing Trump a favor against this traitor.
[00:30:35.939 --> 00:30:37.660]  It just shows there's no honor amongst thieves.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:47.283]  Well, not only that, but I did learn that most of the most prominent neocons in the Trump administration, the most problematic ones, H.R.
[00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:55.246]  McMaster, Rex Tillerson, Rod Rosenstein, these people were sponsored, yes, by Steve Bannon.
[00:30:55.646 --> 00:31:08.310]  So he talks a great game as a nationalist, but he has been crucial in placing some of the neocons who did, I think, real damage to the Trump administration until the president got wise and got rid of them.
[00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.532]  So, look, I don't know how this unfolds.
[00:31:11.572 --> 00:31:20.377]  Remember, the Wall Street Journal has also reported that there are ongoing investigations into Bannon's relationship with a Chinese billionaire.
[00:31:21.098 --> 00:31:22.959]  I don't know what will come of any of that.
[00:31:23.079 --> 00:31:24.840]  I don't know if there's any wrongdoing there.
[00:31:25.581 --> 00:31:28.162]  But this, I think this story is to be continued.
[00:31:30.283 --> 00:31:35.547]  This is a big deal that he groveled to the deep state.
[00:31:36.448 --> 00:31:42.856]  But still, they burned him as a cheap trick against Trump that nobody's buying to try to discredit the wall or something.
[00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:44.238]  Can you speak to that briefly?
[00:31:44.278 --> 00:31:48.523]  And then let's shift gears into another subject I'll bring up in a moment.
[00:31:49.864 --> 00:32:11.253]  Yeah, I think the overriding desire here is to undermine the President, but the truth is, despite the fact that Bannon keeps planting these stories that he's been rehabilitated in the White House and that he's counseling people at the White House are essentially not true, or he may be speaking to people at the White House, but that doesn't mean he has any influence with the President.
[00:32:11.293 --> 00:32:11.873]  Let's remember,
[00:32:12.313 --> 00:32:18.257]  Steve Bannon referred to the Trump Real Estate Company as a organized crime organization.
[00:32:18.677 --> 00:32:22.880]  He called Donald Trump Jr., who is a great patriot, a traitor.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.662]  He accused him of treason, to be more specific.
[00:32:27.243 --> 00:32:30.325]  I don't know why anybody would want this guy back in the tent.
[00:32:31.505 --> 00:32:34.047]  He is really not to be trusted.
[00:32:34.687 --> 00:32:41.372]  And frankly, stealing a million dollars, which is what the indictment accuses him of, is far more serious than the charges
[00:32:42.012 --> 00:32:49.093]  Now Trump just gave a speech, he's still going, but 30 minutes ago he came out and he said you've seen the first indictment of this FBI lawyer that on record
[00:33:11.618 --> 00:33:12.439]  We're good to go.
[00:33:31.505 --> 00:33:39.910]  Now they are really getting scared, and Trump has telegraphed that there are a bunch of indictments and we may actually see Durham take action.
[00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:53.759]  I know I talked to Steve McChinney, who has big Pentagon and CIA connections and is one of the most accurate guys I know, and he said he's surprised that Trump actually did this or could get Barr to do this, but the word is they're going to move against the deep state before the election.
[00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:54.899]  That's what we're hearing now.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.221]  What do you think of that statement, if that's accurate?
[00:33:58.075 --> 00:34:02.719]  Well, first of all, Steve Pichinik is a very credible source, and he has his own sources.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.785]  As a veteran of the counterintelligence establishment, he knows a lot, but he's a truth teller.
[00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:19.354]  At the same time, my fear is that we scapegoat Clinesmith without ever finding out who instructed Clinesmith to do this, who above him.
[00:34:19.914 --> 00:34:36.762]  It's not incidental that Andrew Weissman, the so-called pitbull of the Mueller investigation, actively urging Department of Justice employees not to cooperate with any of these investigations, I believe that's obstruction of justice, has falsely accused me of
[00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:39.343]  Hiding misconduct by the President.
[00:34:39.804 --> 00:34:46.628]  Oh, let's talk about the new Senate committee stuff we're hearing where they're saying that, you know, they have intel you were a Russian, which like WMDs in Iraq.
[00:34:46.928 --> 00:34:48.529]  Roger Stone, straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:51.451]  Roger Stone's our guest.
[00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:52.692]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:34:52.792 --> 00:34:55.354]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday transmission.
[00:34:55.874 --> 00:34:56.574]  Little tidbit.
[00:34:57.795 --> 00:35:00.157]  Last weekend, where they blocked my wife and I,
[00:35:01.038 --> 00:35:01.438]  I don't know.
[00:35:18.396 --> 00:35:20.177]  A lot of, you know, deep research, then I make the decision.
[00:35:20.197 --> 00:35:22.558]  It's like a timer, just ping, and then it's done.
[00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:33.564]  Tomorrow we're going to go and swim where Barton Springs, the creek, comes in, where it's the beautiful, you know, 70 degrees, deep aquifer water.
[00:35:34.064 --> 00:35:35.605]  There's plenty of parking right down there.
[00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:38.946]  But I told folks, I'm getting everybody food for at least 500.
[00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:41.319]  It's by the monkey tree.
[00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:43.960]  It's on the south side of Barton Springs in downtown Austin.
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.081]  Plenty of parking.
[00:35:45.981 --> 00:35:49.483]  And, you know, they've tried to say that the trails are closed, but the parking lots are open.
[00:35:49.523 --> 00:35:50.364]  I'll see you there tomorrow.
[00:35:50.664 --> 00:35:52.425]  All right, let's get back to Roger Stone.
[00:35:53.486 --> 00:35:58.389]  Somebody told me 10 years ago I'd be on air in 2020 going, and we're going to go protest that we're allowed to go to the park!
[00:35:58.889 --> 00:35:59.970]  But that's where we are.
[00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:03.152]  If we were burning down houses and shooting police, we'd be heroes, according to the left.
[00:36:03.612 --> 00:36:08.175]  Roger, this is bigger than your case, and I care about you, and when you said
[00:36:09.329 --> 00:36:11.150]  Three years ago, when they were setting you up, you were worried.
[00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.771]  Two years ago, I thought you were exaggerating.
[00:36:13.011 --> 00:36:14.812]  Then they tried to get me indicted and my dad indicted.
[00:36:14.832 --> 00:36:15.972]  I learned, wow, this is real.
[00:36:16.332 --> 00:36:17.153]  And so I apologize.
[00:36:17.173 --> 00:36:17.553]  You were right.
[00:36:18.673 --> 00:36:19.414]  But it is bigger than you.
[00:36:19.454 --> 00:36:22.095]  It's about all of us, about them saying that we didn't vote for Trump.
[00:36:22.175 --> 00:36:22.876]  Russia did it.
[00:36:23.596 --> 00:36:28.498]  They're back at it again in the Senate with no evidence saying you're a Russian agent recycling that.
[00:36:28.538 --> 00:36:29.879]  So nip that in the bud for us.
[00:36:30.754 --> 00:36:40.359]  Yeah, the Senate Intelligence Committee report was released on Friday, and it is the same fabricated recycling of the same old nonsense.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:51.165]  Interestingly enough, it says in this report that they assessed that Roger Stone spoke multiple times with Donald Trump regarding the release of the WikiLeaks disclosures.
[00:36:51.765 --> 00:36:58.348]  Assessed is always a word that the intelligence agencies use when they have a theory that they have no evidence or proof for.
[00:36:59.029 --> 00:37:16.017]  This is categorically false, but it is designed to bolster the false claim, the big lie, that Roger Stone traded his silence regarding misconduct by the President in conversations that were inappropriate in return for clemency in his case.
[00:37:16.377 --> 00:37:18.898]  There is no evidence of that whatsoever.
[00:37:19.258 --> 00:37:29.170]  You have the uncorroborated plea bargain induced testimony of Michael Cohen and Rick Gates, which they cannot prove because it is false.
[00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:34.536]  They both made a deal to get reduced sentences in return for those lies.
[00:37:34.616 --> 00:37:35.517]  By the way, I passed
[00:37:35.837 --> 00:37:39.142]  Two polygraph tests on this exact question.
[00:37:39.542 --> 00:37:53.000]  So it also says in the report, for example, Alison, July of 2016, I wrote a tweet for Donald Trump, candidate Trump, at his direction, proposing some peace plan with Vladimir Putin.
[00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:55.000]  This is whole cloth.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:01.045]  I wrote no tweets for candidate Trump whatsoever in 2016, including this one.
[00:38:01.565 --> 00:38:03.246]  Where does this information come from?
[00:38:03.647 --> 00:38:10.812]  When you look at the leadership of this committee, it is the disgraced Richard Burr who got caught insider trading.
[00:38:10.952 --> 00:38:12.614]  And it comes out of the rear end of Adam Schiff.
[00:38:13.633 --> 00:38:22.802]  I know you're talking about the Senate, but going back to the House, Schiff is still a central character they want us to forget about.
[00:38:22.902 --> 00:38:25.584]  Isn't he quarterbacking a lot of this?
[00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:41.975]  Thank God the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee were not rhinos, at least not all of them, and they were more aggressive.
[00:38:42.415 --> 00:38:45.338]  And I think Chairman Nunes came to the correct conclusion.
[00:38:45.378 --> 00:38:48.900]  There was no evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.
[00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:54.765]  This document that they released last week implies that there is, but there's no proof to it.
[00:38:55.065 --> 00:38:56.726]  It is a false narrative.
[00:38:57.126 --> 00:39:02.811]  Warner continues to imply that I had something to do with the timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures.
[00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:05.673]  For which there is no evidence at all.
[00:39:05.693 --> 00:39:07.514]  Well, I've seen the Democrats in general, Roger.
[00:39:07.554 --> 00:39:10.135]  They're running ads and stuff about Russiagate again.
[00:39:10.416 --> 00:39:11.336]  They think we're that stupid.
[00:39:11.376 --> 00:39:12.717]  I think this is a losing issue.
[00:39:13.077 --> 00:39:14.498]  I think America has rejected it.
[00:39:14.538 --> 00:39:18.000]  But they're such an alien force wanting to get rid of the country itself.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:24.184]  They have to brand us as the outside pathogen because they're the ones on the Chai Com Dole.
[00:39:24.564 --> 00:39:30.728]  And I really like to see Trump running big ads showing how Joe Biden's bought and paid for by a foreign power.
[00:39:30.748 --> 00:39:31.609]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:39:32.546 --> 00:39:32.906]  I agree.
[00:39:32.926 --> 00:39:37.390]  I think that is one of Biden's several greatest vulnerabilities.
[00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:47.859]  If you watch that snooze fest last night, the Democratic National Convention, this idea that the president bungled the coronavirus crisis is completely false.
[00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:53.784]  This idea that hydrochloroquine and zinc don't work, that's false also.
[00:39:54.505 --> 00:40:01.616]  The president had the audacity to appoint to an inexpensive medication which there's now more than enough of medical evidence.
[00:40:01.636 --> 00:40:07.065]  Yeah, something that actually works at 99% because he wants to fix it instead of create a problem and milk it for 100 years.
[00:40:08.058 --> 00:40:16.165]  And he doesn't want the pharmaceutical companies to cash in on what is a legitimate, but probably overstated, public health crisis.
[00:40:16.185 --> 00:40:16.645]  I totally agree.
[00:40:16.665 --> 00:40:17.806]  Look, we've only got five minutes left with you.
[00:40:17.846 --> 00:40:18.607]  You're a busy man.
[00:40:19.868 --> 00:40:20.649]  People need to support you.
[00:40:20.669 --> 00:40:29.596]  They need to get your Roger Stone still did nothing wrong, because you're a signet, a standard of victory against their evil at your main website.
[00:40:30.057 --> 00:40:31.037]  And we'll get that out in a moment.
[00:40:31.077 --> 00:40:32.899]  But I've been asking the questions today.
[00:40:32.979 --> 00:40:35.141]  What other stuff's on your radar you want to tell people about?
[00:40:36.414 --> 00:40:45.740]  Well, obviously the Republican National Convention is coming up, and the President and his people are working very hard to have a superior presentation.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.143]  These conventions do impact the voters' attitudes.
[00:40:50.183 --> 00:40:52.944]  The President has been gaining in the polls.
[00:40:53.345 --> 00:40:55.246]  He is closing the gap.
[00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:56.847]  That gap is caused
[00:40:57.467 --> 00:41:11.689]  Quite frankly, by the collapse of the economy, because of the measures the President had no choice but to take to protect the country in the COVID-19 crisis, and because of the relentless falsehoods coming from the mainstream media.
[00:41:11.809 --> 00:41:22.891]  At the same time, you have the widespread and increasing censorship of patriots, liberals, Republicans, conservatives, non-liberals, Trump supporters, Christians, on the Internet.
[00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:26.532]  This combined factor is why the President is, I think,
[00:41:27.653 --> 00:41:30.055]  No, I agree.
[00:41:30.075 --> 00:41:35.599]  I just heard a train wreck sound.
[00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:36.740]  Did I really respect you?
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.281]  Because you're an optimist.
[00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:39.863]  You're saying Trump's behind right now.
[00:41:39.883 --> 00:41:41.524]  I heard a record skip there.
[00:41:41.564 --> 00:41:45.047]  Let's start over with that because that makes me have a little bit of a pucker factor here.
[00:41:46.215 --> 00:41:54.100]  I think he is slightly behind probably nationally and in probably more than half of the swing states, but that doesn't concern me.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.921]  He was behind at this point in 2016 as well.
[00:41:55.981 --> 00:42:01.765]  Sure, so they're going to pull the shenanigan on the post office next week to overshadow the convention.
[00:42:02.768 --> 00:42:03.588]  They will try to.
[00:42:03.708 --> 00:42:06.749]  Look, they will try to distract to the extent that they can.
[00:42:07.129 --> 00:42:08.809]  The president can win this contest.
[00:42:08.849 --> 00:42:10.710]  I think he will win this contest.
[00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:14.711]  He needs a more focused approach in the fall, which I think you'll see.
[00:42:15.431 --> 00:42:19.572]  But again, I am not one of those country club Republicans running for the high grass.
[00:42:20.072 --> 00:42:21.812]  I think he's slightly behind today.
[00:42:21.832 --> 00:42:24.873]  I explained why, but I think he can make up that ground.
[00:42:24.893 --> 00:42:28.834]  By the way, you said exactly this four years ago, but in studio with us.
[00:42:29.639 --> 00:42:30.479]  That's exactly right.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:41.906]  Look, institutionally, the combination of the internet censorship and the mainstream media added to the ballot fraud that we expect is what's going to make this a very difficult race.
[00:42:42.366 --> 00:42:43.486]  There's nothing new here.
[00:42:44.467 --> 00:42:49.250]  If you didn't have those factors, if you had an honest election, Donald Trump would run away with this.
[00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:51.731]  But any Republican or any Trump supporter
[00:42:52.429 --> 00:42:57.154]  Who is sitting back thinking that this will be a landslide because the silent majority is going to pull it out.
[00:42:57.734 --> 00:43:01.138]  Overconfidence is one of our most egregious problems.
[00:43:01.538 --> 00:43:06.323]  I still find pockets of overconfidence among the president's supporters.
[00:43:06.403 --> 00:43:07.724]  I keep running into it as well.
[00:43:07.984 --> 00:43:09.646]  Let me just do a few little factoids.
[00:43:09.666 --> 00:43:11.287]  And if you gotta go, you gotta go to do five more.
[00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:12.288]  Just blink.
[00:43:12.408 --> 00:43:13.509]  Can you do five more, Roger?
[00:43:14.445 --> 00:43:16.446]  Actually, I have to end this segment.
[00:43:16.486 --> 00:43:17.006]  No, I know.
[00:43:17.046 --> 00:43:18.007]  You're a busy guy now.
[00:43:18.047 --> 00:43:18.307]  Wow.
[00:43:18.367 --> 00:43:19.027]  Talk about in demand.
[00:43:19.608 --> 00:43:20.168]  Sean Hannity.
[00:43:20.228 --> 00:43:20.888]  I like Sean Hannity.
[00:43:20.928 --> 00:43:23.870]  I think the steltered thing about how he hates the president.
[00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.231]  They're trying to drive a wedge between Hannity and Trump.
[00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:27.231]  I think that's BS gut level.
[00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:27.711]  What do you think?
[00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:29.953]  I love Sean Hannity.
[00:43:29.973 --> 00:43:32.274]  He was very good to me in my epic fight for freedom.
[00:43:32.734 --> 00:43:35.135]  I know that he has great affection for the president.
[00:43:35.515 --> 00:43:36.496]  He's expressed it to me.
[00:43:36.536 --> 00:43:38.757]  I've never heard him say anything of the kind.
[00:43:38.777 --> 00:43:40.958]  So this is another attempted wedge operation?
[00:43:41.806 --> 00:43:44.108]  Yeah, Brian Stelter's not a credible source.
[00:43:44.849 --> 00:43:47.171]  And we don't name whoever supposedly said this.
[00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:51.795]  I happen to know that Sean Hannity has great affection and respect for the President.
[00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.336]  He's told me that numerous times.
[00:43:53.677 --> 00:43:54.918]  Why would he say otherwise?
[00:43:55.658 --> 00:43:57.900]  He might have said the President's crazy like a fox.
[00:43:58.301 --> 00:43:59.242]  He didn't say he's crazy.
[00:44:00.163 --> 00:44:00.903]  Absolutely not.
[00:44:01.224 --> 00:44:02.644]  Look, it's just disinformation.
[00:44:02.724 --> 00:44:04.805]  It's yet another smear attempt.
[00:44:04.845 --> 00:44:07.946]  Remember, I don't believe anything CNN says.
[00:44:08.367 --> 00:44:12.008]  I don't get my news from CNN for the same reason I don't eat out of the toilet.
[00:44:12.048 --> 00:44:15.770]  No, I agree, but they still try to stay relevant by just saying whopper lies.
[00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.711]  And like, even I have trouble sometimes just wanting to know.
[00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:20.112]  Roger, amazing.
[00:44:20.252 --> 00:44:21.732]  Very exciting what's going on.
[00:44:21.752 --> 00:44:26.234]  And we're just glad that you are not in prison, and they are certainly pissed about that.
[00:44:26.514 --> 00:44:27.775]  Have a great weekend, my friend.
[00:44:28.795 --> 00:44:41.883]  I'm now back at StoneColdTruth.com, posting regularly on the latest political news, so folks who saw our hiatus during the gag can go back to StoneColdTruth.com and follow my political analysis there.
[00:44:41.943 --> 00:44:42.484]  Many thanks.
[00:44:42.644 --> 00:44:43.304]  Thank you, Roger.
[00:44:44.005 --> 00:44:46.306]  All right, I had a couple more questions, but they'll come back on next week.
[00:44:46.326 --> 00:44:46.906]  We'll get to those then.
[00:44:46.926 --> 00:44:47.907]  There'll be so much more about that.
[00:44:47.927 --> 00:44:48.848]  And speaking of plugging,
[00:44:49.884 --> 00:44:51.825]  If you don't get an InfoWars t-shirt, you're crazy.
[00:44:51.865 --> 00:44:57.989]  We've got what I think is the official campaign shirt this year, a big, bold American eagle with a Betsy Ross flag that it's perched on top of.
[00:44:58.009 --> 00:44:59.350]  It's not a disrespect to the flag.
[00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.191]  It all goes together like a horse and carriage.
[00:45:01.211 --> 00:45:01.831]  It's very beautiful.
[00:45:02.252 --> 00:45:07.094]  And it's got the American flag on the arm, and it's got Keeping America Great on the back, InfoWars.com.
[00:45:07.114 --> 00:45:08.215]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[00:45:08.815 --> 00:45:11.557]  And we've got high-quality, affordable food now ready to ship within one to two weeks.
[00:45:11.597 --> 00:45:11.877]  They've got it.
[00:45:11.897 --> 00:45:12.718]  They just have to package it.
[00:45:13.198 --> 00:45:16.760]  And we've got so many other great products and a big sale going right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.621]  Thanks for your support.
[00:45:18.986 --> 00:45:20.827]  Let the good times roll!
[00:45:20.847 --> 00:45:28.212]  Yeah, well, the good times ain't rolling for the New World Order, and I'm gonna talk about it next segment.
[00:45:30.234 --> 00:45:32.455]  Their house of cards is coming down.
[00:45:34.977 --> 00:45:38.019]  And our good times are gonna roll after we make it through these hard times.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.260]  Probably take 20, 30 years.
[00:45:41.741 --> 00:45:46.705]  But after that, we're over the mountain, and wow, the eye's not seen, the ear not heard, the next level.
[00:45:48.029 --> 00:45:50.352]  You think all this is amazing compared to somebody a thousand years ago?
[00:45:50.852 --> 00:45:52.595]  This is just the dark side of technology.
[00:45:53.055 --> 00:45:53.776]  The evil side.
[00:45:53.816 --> 00:45:54.557]  Imagine the real side.
[00:45:54.777 --> 00:45:56.359]  Let's go to part of this special report here.
[00:45:56.379 --> 00:46:00.004]  The UN wants your children.
[00:46:01.886 --> 00:46:05.330]  If you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this.
[00:46:06.556 --> 00:46:15.840]  If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can and they will if we don't make a change in this election.
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:24.704]  If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.
[00:46:25.324 --> 00:46:26.625]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:27.779 --> 00:46:30.943]  Big Mike's telling you he's gonna break your kneecaps if you don't do what he says.
[00:46:31.263 --> 00:46:45.221]  Major universities have just announced that you will not be allowed to leave campus and that you will all have to have a issued cell phone authorized that has a tracker app on it and that if you leave for the entire semester you will be expelled.
[00:46:45.686 --> 00:46:51.487]  Syracuse University is using an app called Spotter EDU to track students' locations on campus.
[00:46:52.027 --> 00:46:55.508]  Do you find it creepy that the university has access to your location?
[00:46:56.308 --> 00:46:56.748]  Uh, yeah.
[00:46:56.828 --> 00:46:58.769]  I don't think that I would be okay with something like that.
[00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:04.050]  In regards to privacy and professionalism, I don't think it's necessary for a professor to know where I am.
[00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:10.231]  I mean, students pay a lot of money to go to school, and if they want to not attend that class, I think that's their choice.
[00:47:10.631 --> 00:47:11.671]  Everywhere you go will be tracked.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:13.092]  You will live in a bubble.
[00:47:13.132 --> 00:47:14.092]  Basically, you'll have a
[00:47:14.892 --> 00:47:17.433]  I am especially concerned about the well-being of the world's children.
[00:47:17.453 --> 00:47:21.374]  Thankfully, children have so far been largely spared from the most severe symptoms of the disease.
[00:47:45.011 --> 00:47:47.532]  But their lives are being totally upended.
[00:47:48.933 --> 00:47:51.855]  I appeal to families everywhere and leaders at all levels.
[00:47:52.295 --> 00:47:53.676]  Protect our children.
[00:47:54.249 --> 00:47:56.951]  And it's about destroying the economy and vertically integrating things.
[00:47:56.971 --> 00:48:00.733]  They also say at these universities you can only go to the stores they authorize.
[00:48:01.033 --> 00:48:07.577]  And you tattle on people not wearing masks that it's going to be those that don't have their inoculation records on the app.
[00:48:07.958 --> 00:48:09.579]  This is the dystopian takeover.
[00:48:10.379 --> 00:48:12.120]  But humanity is fighting back.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.441]  There's major resistance to it.
[00:48:13.821 --> 00:48:14.502]  This is a warning.
[00:48:15.342 --> 00:48:15.983]  For what's coming.
[00:48:16.003 --> 00:48:17.764]  It's not going to be peaceful much longer.
[00:48:17.964 --> 00:48:18.605]  It's not going to be rah-rah.
[00:48:18.625 --> 00:48:19.606]  It's not going to be speeches.
[00:48:19.646 --> 00:48:21.808]  It's not going to be gathering outside, saying the Pledge of Allegiance.
[00:48:21.848 --> 00:48:23.289]  It's not going to be waving flags.
[00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:24.470]  It's going to be real.
[00:48:25.131 --> 00:48:27.853]  I've been in combat, and I never want to go back again.
[00:48:28.053 --> 00:48:30.035]  But I'm telling you what, I will to save this country.
[00:48:30.716 --> 00:48:32.797]  If it has to be against our own citizens, it will happen.
[00:48:33.678 --> 00:48:35.099]  And there's a million people like me.
[00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:36.199]  And you won't stop us.
[00:48:36.719 --> 00:48:37.759]  Take the masks off!
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.000]  Quit masking and muzzling your children!
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.021]  The psychological damage you're doing to them is horrible.
[00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:45.982]  I've had six friends kill themselves since it's happened.
[00:48:46.382 --> 00:48:47.483]  Veterans who lost their jobs.
[00:48:48.123 --> 00:48:50.364]  How do you feel about being complicit in perpetuating that?
[00:48:50.684 --> 00:48:52.785]  The greatest toast I've perpetuated on the American people.
[00:48:52.845 --> 00:48:56.226]  It's one thing to know that the UN announced they want this.
[00:48:56.566 --> 00:49:01.548]  It's another thing to see them implement every step of what they said they would.
[00:49:02.268 --> 00:49:18.629]  In Spain, and in Australia, and now in New Zealand, they are taking children from people's homes who are refusing to be COVID-tested when they shut down whole tower blocks, showing that's the weakest point to live in under globalist control is in one of those high-rises, obviously.
[00:49:18.869 --> 00:49:35.241]  The whole country has moved to alert level two and that is that of course everyone across the country outside of Auckland, we're asking for social distancing, we're asking for those limits on mass gatherings again and we're asking everyone to keep track of where they have been.
[00:49:35.481 --> 00:49:40.885]  But they're treading the police and locals who accept it and now we have the newscast, we have the articles, they're on Infowars.com.
[00:49:41.505 --> 00:49:50.847]  Where they signed on to a WHO directive, because that's who directs the COVID hoax response, and they are now taking children.
[00:49:51.308 --> 00:49:56.129]  They specifically mentioned children, and they call it a benefit of the UN.
[00:49:56.469 --> 00:49:57.669]  Oh, a benefit!
[00:49:57.989 --> 00:50:04.491]  Because if they can train you to see men in uniforms taking your children away, they can do anything.
[00:50:05.331 --> 00:50:07.692]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:50:10.101 --> 00:50:10.361]  3 p.m.
[00:50:10.381 --> 00:50:14.703]  I'm here live ahead of the war with Owen Schroyer that comes on after that and David Knight, 8 a.m.
[00:50:14.723 --> 00:50:15.783]  in the morning, doing a great job.
[00:50:16.204 --> 00:50:16.864]  Band out video.
[00:50:18.024 --> 00:50:22.206]  And we're on the satellites, we're on the shortwave, we're on the AM, FM, TV stations.
[00:50:22.786 --> 00:50:26.147]  All of it, you can find it at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:50:27.668 --> 00:50:29.729]  Okay, let me just get into this right now.
[00:50:36.027 --> 00:50:40.229]  When I say I'm going to be honest with you, it just means that I don't want to be honest with you.
[00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:49.572]  And by that, all I've got is that I tell people what I really think.
[00:50:50.072 --> 00:50:53.074]  If I'm joking around, I'll tell you, but still in the satire, you get the truth of what I'm doing.
[00:50:53.294 --> 00:50:54.994]  And 99% of the time I'm being serious.
[00:50:55.755 --> 00:50:58.276]  They always take the satire out of context, even though I love satire.
[00:50:58.496 --> 00:50:59.176]  It's a good escape.
[00:50:59.236 --> 00:50:59.696]  It's fun.
[00:50:59.736 --> 00:51:04.518]  I don't do it very much because it gets taken out of context and I'm not sure that's a good thing.
[00:51:05.657 --> 00:51:09.382]  But man, the enemy's winning in certain ways, they're losing in others.
[00:51:09.762 --> 00:51:21.597]  Their whole globalist house of cards is starting to come down, but their plan to counter that is to implode everything and get us so distracted with trying to feed ourselves, they don't get in trouble, and they run off to all their armored fortresses while we kill each other.
[00:51:22.478 --> 00:51:24.400]  It doesn't mean we don't have real beefs with each other.
[00:51:25.503 --> 00:51:28.704]  Doesn't mean there's not racist white people, racist black people, racist whatever.
[00:51:29.364 --> 00:51:31.045]  It doesn't mean that there isn't real issues.
[00:51:31.365 --> 00:51:35.166]  But the big New World Order mothership is killing everybody.
[00:51:35.907 --> 00:51:37.107]  And we gotta save the ship.
[00:51:38.147 --> 00:51:40.328]  And then later we wanna be idiots and kill each other, we can do that.
[00:51:40.348 --> 00:51:41.769]  At least we're not gonna blow the planet up.
[00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.231]  So I get it, I'm not a racist to hate somebody because of what color they are.
[00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:51.412]  But I'm dealing with a racist group that doesn't like me because of what color I am.
[00:51:53.667 --> 00:51:54.588]  I don't like those people.
[00:51:54.948 --> 00:51:55.668]  I get angry at them.
[00:51:55.868 --> 00:52:03.052]  And when I'm getting attacked by that group of people, it's going to be white people that come to my aid.
[00:52:05.173 --> 00:52:07.434]  That's the way tribalism works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:07.474 --> 00:52:08.915]  And I don't want to punch those buttons.
[00:52:09.635 --> 00:52:14.898]  Because I punch those buttons, I personally will become wealthier and more successful for a little while.
[00:52:16.439 --> 00:52:17.699]  And then we'll all be destroyed together.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.740]  Well, that's not winning the game.
[00:52:20.821 --> 00:52:23.002]  So just from a Machiavellian view, I'm human.
[00:52:25.131 --> 00:52:28.873]  So I've got a pro-human outlook, but what's the thing I don't want to get into?
[00:52:30.634 --> 00:52:31.435]  And I figured this out.
[00:52:31.535 --> 00:52:41.281]  I'm tempted to stop doing research before and after the show and just do like a six hour show, but where I read it and talk about it for the first time on air.
[00:52:41.481 --> 00:52:45.764]  Because my problem is when I get in here and they've got hundreds of articles in front of me, I've already seen a lot of it.
[00:52:46.104 --> 00:52:50.967]  And then it's like, it's almost like, like I'm a devil worshiper to look at this.
[00:52:51.007 --> 00:52:52.248]  Like, I don't want to look at this.
[00:52:53.936 --> 00:52:56.057]  And I don't want to tell you again what I want to do to the people.
[00:52:56.097 --> 00:52:56.797]  You know what I want.
[00:52:56.817 --> 00:53:01.400]  I mean, we're not supposed to be around stuff like this.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.981]  They bombard us with this.
[00:53:04.041 --> 00:53:09.424]  So I went and reviewed this morning and last night what they're putting on TV for kids, man.
[00:53:09.444 --> 00:53:11.365]  And I can't handle it.
[00:53:12.225 --> 00:53:13.566]  I mean, I want to start killing people.
[00:53:13.586 --> 00:53:15.787]  I'm going to be, I can't get it off the screen.
[00:53:17.348 --> 00:53:18.308]  I'm not kidding around folks.
[00:53:18.389 --> 00:53:19.249]  I'm at my breaking point.
[00:53:22.981 --> 00:53:32.345]  Because there's a certain Satanism to this, that they just normalize it, where now it's out in the open, and now we talk about it, and they don't even get in trouble, and we do!
[00:53:35.787 --> 00:53:36.527]  And that's not all.
[00:53:36.727 --> 00:53:43.710]  I went this morning, I got up at 4 a.m., and I saw this story at like 5 a.m., and I went, oh God, I remember that trailer.
[00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.991]  I went and watched it, and then I went and looked at some others.
[00:53:49.537 --> 00:53:55.019]  I was walking down the stairs and I started dry heaving and throwing up on the floor.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.221]  And I actually stumbled into a side bedroom and laid on the ground for about 30 minutes.
[00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:03.382]  And I'm not saying that to, like, get your sympathy.
[00:54:03.462 --> 00:54:04.122]  I'm not a victim.
[00:54:04.142 --> 00:54:04.502]  I'm a warrior.
[00:54:04.802 --> 00:54:07.263]  I can't handle these people, man!
[00:54:07.824 --> 00:54:11.665]  They got our kids, they're ruining their lives, and they're laughing at us!
[00:54:13.547 --> 00:54:19.229]  And it's not normal to come up here and make it an outrage that we just talk about what they're doing!
[00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:21.970]  I can't look at it!
[00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.030]  Because you know what?
[00:54:25.031 --> 00:54:29.293]  We know what they did to the little kid once they took him in there and they show you on TV what they did.
[00:54:32.174 --> 00:54:34.795]  Adults can't handle looking at these crime videos.
[00:54:35.235 --> 00:54:36.195]  Police can't handle it.
[00:54:36.395 --> 00:54:38.796]  And they do it out in the open.
[00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:45.251]  In fact, now, I can't even, I go to that place, I just, I can't even do it.
[00:54:47.191 --> 00:54:50.472]  And it's not, people that listen a long time know, I didn't used to do this thing where I go, I can't do the show anymore.
[00:54:50.492 --> 00:54:52.012]  This is a new thing, the last year.
[00:54:52.032 --> 00:54:58.654]  And it's because, I just, I know you're overloaded too, and that's what the enemies try to do.
[00:54:58.914 --> 00:55:05.455]  So we have to give it to God, and say, God, I'm just gonna get the information out, and I'm not gonna let myself take on the pain of this.
[00:55:05.495 --> 00:55:09.376]  But then, it's a double-edged sword, and God goes, no, you're supposed to take on the pain.
[00:55:12.964 --> 00:55:14.645]  God's like, I took on all of it.
[00:55:14.685 --> 00:55:19.748]  You can't even look at it one little piece, get your ass up and stop being a wimp.
[00:55:20.688 --> 00:55:21.689]  So I'll be honest, I'm a wimp.
[00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:24.731]  That's the process and that's, you know, it is.
[00:55:24.771 --> 00:55:30.314]  We just, but then I look at people who won't even look at this and won't even speak out against it.
[00:55:30.514 --> 00:55:36.097]  And I hate you more than the devil worshiping pedophiles because you can stop it!
[00:55:39.179 --> 00:55:39.739]  But you don't.
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.120]  So.
[00:55:43.846 --> 00:55:47.870]  I don't like the collapse that's coming, because I know it's not going to be fun.
[00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.751]  But you know what?
[00:55:48.831 --> 00:55:49.812]  We all deserve it.
[00:55:50.572 --> 00:56:08.750]  And so all of you that have been on the fence, that think all this Satanism is funny, and think going along with it's funny, and think you're powerful because you don't care, you think you're strong because you don't care about anybody, and you've got your little world, and that's all you care about, your little empty plastic world is going to be destroyed!
[00:56:16.127 --> 00:56:17.648]  And you're too stupid to even know it.
[00:56:17.668 --> 00:56:33.541]  I sit there and I talk to these sociopaths, and I explain to them, I go, you understand that once there's no morals, and once there's no conscience, and once things collapse, you live in this satanic fantasy world where you can just crap over whoever you want and nothing ever comes back.
[00:56:33.821 --> 00:56:37.044]  Don't you understand that it comes back on you very quickly?
[00:56:37.845 --> 00:56:45.291]  But satanists can't think two step, three step, four step, five step, six step, seven step, eight step, because they don't have God.
[00:56:47.148 --> 00:56:49.289]  I have discernment because I'm tied into God.
[00:56:49.329 --> 00:56:50.129]  I'm not bragging about it.
[00:56:50.229 --> 00:56:51.750]  I've got a million steps!
[00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:54.471]  I can see all of it!
[00:56:54.631 --> 00:56:56.071]  And let me tell you, I don't like seeing it.
[00:56:57.092 --> 00:56:58.852]  So maybe that's why these people are like this.
[00:56:58.892 --> 00:57:06.375]  But my God, if you decide you don't want to see the truth and don't want to stand up, just don't be so smiley face about it like it's funny because it ain't funny.
[00:57:06.795 --> 00:57:11.417]  You want to live a few more years and drive your Porsche around and act cool at the country club?
[00:57:11.817 --> 00:57:16.439]  Go ahead, but know you're like a man eating his last meal going up before a firing squad because
[00:57:17.219 --> 00:57:22.563]  If you were actually self-serving, you would want morality, even if you're a sociopath.
[00:57:22.743 --> 00:57:30.689]  But there's something about sociopaths and psychopaths who have a spirit of evil, they're destroying themselves along with all of us!
[00:57:33.051 --> 00:57:37.254]  Because their selfishness is absolutely who they are!
[00:57:46.553 --> 00:57:54.719]  They know why they flaunt this pedophilia and this satanism in front of us, because they know people that don't like it, turn away from it and just give them control of the field.
[00:57:54.759 --> 00:57:56.620]  No, I'm gonna look at all of it!
[00:57:57.361 --> 00:57:58.622]  And I'm gonna attack it all!
[00:57:58.642 --> 00:58:00.844]  And I'm gonna put the most horrible things on air!
[00:58:01.924 --> 00:58:06.308]  And when the TV stations call up and say, sir, you can't put that on, I go, that's what five-year-olds are shown!
[00:58:06.648 --> 00:58:07.749]  You think I wanna look at that?
[00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:09.370]  You think I wanna look at that?!
[00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:11.051]  You think I like that?!
[00:58:13.853 --> 00:58:14.454]  What I wanna do,
[00:58:16.604 --> 00:58:20.528]  You know what I want to do is get these people off the children and off of us!
[00:58:20.548 --> 00:58:21.929]  You think they just want to rape children?
[00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:24.471]  They want to rape your mind.
[00:58:24.732 --> 00:58:25.933]  They want to rape your cells.
[00:58:26.173 --> 00:58:27.534]  They want to rape your DNA.
[00:58:27.715 --> 00:58:28.916]  They want to rape your future.
[00:58:29.096 --> 00:58:30.517]  They want to rape everything!
[00:58:30.537 --> 00:58:31.798]  Because that's who they are!
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.402]  They don't want to love people.
[00:58:35.542 --> 00:58:36.903]  They don't want to nurture things.
[00:58:36.923 --> 00:58:38.285]  They want to cut stuff down.
[00:58:38.325 --> 00:58:39.766]  They want to burn it to the ground!
[00:58:40.607 --> 00:58:41.508]  Well, good!
[00:58:42.947 --> 00:58:47.368]  Because all you parasites that love death so much, you're going to burn.
[00:58:47.388 --> 00:58:50.629]  And you're going to burn very, very slowly forever.
[00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:53.530]  And so that's why justice works that way.
[00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:56.870]  What you are is what you become forever.
[00:58:57.191 --> 00:59:02.232]  You burn us, you hurt us, you torture us, you will be that forever.
[00:59:02.452 --> 00:59:04.732]  God doesn't cast you into a lake of fire.
[00:59:05.032 --> 00:59:06.853]  You are the lake of fire!
[00:59:10.222 --> 00:59:17.147]  So, you just enjoy yourselves all day long while you piss on everything because you're done.
[00:59:20.249 --> 00:59:28.394]  And so, it's like when the police bust some serial killer with 20 bodies buried in the backyard, or in the basement, or in their walls.
[00:59:28.955 --> 00:59:35.119]  And it's disgusting, and it stinks, and they're looking at all of it, and they've shot video of it, but at least the guy's busted and ain't gonna do it anymore.
[00:59:35.899 --> 00:59:37.780]  It's a good thing when you find them.
[00:59:38.081 --> 00:59:39.462]  It's a good thing when you dig them up.
[00:59:40.342 --> 00:59:42.804]  And you deliver the little kids back to their parents so they have a proper burial.
[00:59:43.325 --> 00:59:44.666]  Because at least they got stopped.
[00:59:45.006 --> 00:59:48.890]  So those of you that say I'm obscene because I cover this, NO!
[00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:51.792]  I am here and you are here to destroy them!
[00:59:52.252 --> 00:59:56.456]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:57.437 --> 01:00:04.643]  I have critical microcosm news for you that affects Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, and the entire planet.
[01:00:04.663 --> 01:00:04.803]  My wife,
[01:00:10.751 --> 01:00:26.216]  A few weeks ago, tried to go on the hike and bike trail near our house, and they had people there with clipboards saying you're not allowed to go in COVID-19 to the giant green belt that's, again, 98,000 acres, just one piece of it, with beautiful creeks and everything else.
[01:00:27.817 --> 01:00:32.158]  Well, she still went in and ignored them, but she came back after she went with her friend for a hike.
[01:00:33.809 --> 01:00:38.154]  And I called one security guy and I called a camera guy, Greg Reese.
[01:00:38.715 --> 01:00:43.880]  We went over there and then of course the media edited it down to a minute where I was just yelling at random people.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.322]  No, see the glass window they put up?
[01:00:45.882 --> 01:00:47.624]  They called seven police cars on me.
[01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:51.569]  And the police say, listen, there's no ordinances, this is unenforceable.
[01:00:54.332 --> 01:00:58.575]  And the cops after, you know, we turned the cameras off, we're listeners, you know, said they agreed with us.
[01:00:58.595 --> 01:01:06.181]  I don't want to give them too much trouble, but they obviously want to go after robbers and murderers and child molesters and, you know, burglars and people like that.
[01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:07.882]  They understand they don't need to be in the trail.
[01:01:07.902 --> 01:01:11.364]  They had one of dozens, one of hundreds actually, but one of the top 10 or so.
[01:01:11.985 --> 01:01:12.625]  That was a hell of a lot.
[01:01:13.105 --> 01:01:14.767]  Well, I said, oh, we're going to be out there.
[01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:18.767]  This next Saturday, we're gonna march down to Swimmin' Barton Creek.
[01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:22.770]  Well, we get out there, it's 105, I'm not thinkin' we gotta march down, that's one of the longest entrances.
[01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:23.790]  I apologize.
[01:01:24.211 --> 01:01:40.180]  So then I said last weekend, it was so much fun, about 200 people showed up or more, I said, let's go to actual Barton Springs, where it's, Barton Creek empties into it, but it's a big, deep spring, comes out like 68 degrees, it's about 70 degrees, mixed with a creek, and then it dumps into the Colorado River.
[01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:43.645]  They got paddle boarders and, you know, all the folks are already there.
[01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.507]  They rent kayaks, canoes.
[01:01:46.248 --> 01:01:51.232]  But there's a part that's paid that's just a dammed up spring.
[01:01:53.114 --> 01:01:55.236]  Well, they'd close that and then you get reservations.
[01:01:55.276 --> 01:01:59.841]  So I said, we'll just go to the free part just south of Barton Springs.
[01:02:00.301 --> 01:02:01.322]  It's called the Monkey Tree.
[01:02:02.063 --> 01:02:03.864]  And I'm going to order a food truck to come there.
[01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:04.965]  Well, guess what?
[01:02:05.796 --> 01:02:09.638]  We got a call from inside the Park Service in Austin from one of our sources.
[01:02:09.678 --> 01:02:10.478]  They just filled us in.
[01:02:11.139 --> 01:02:13.160]  They had a big task force meeting about this.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.921]  They're trying to get APD to come out there and stop us.
[01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:18.602]  APD is going to basically, the word is refuse.
[01:02:18.642 --> 01:02:19.983]  It's an unenforceable assignment of law.
[01:02:20.523 --> 01:02:21.544]  Everybody's already out there.
[01:02:21.584 --> 01:02:22.424]  The parks are open.
[01:02:22.464 --> 01:02:23.325]  They try to keep them closed.
[01:02:23.605 --> 01:02:24.525]  Everyone just ignored them.
[01:02:24.745 --> 01:02:28.907]  And the police refused to arrest people the last six months going to Zilker, going everywhere.
[01:02:29.187 --> 01:02:30.128]  The cops know it's BS.
[01:02:30.168 --> 01:02:31.008]  It's outside in the sun.
[01:02:31.228 --> 01:02:32.129]  If you believe the COVID hoax.
[01:02:33.891 --> 01:02:37.813]  And so the cops have the same city council that has their proposal to burn down the city council.
[01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:39.694]  Excuse me, that's a funny slip.
[01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:42.076]  To blow up the police station.
[01:02:44.017 --> 01:02:47.299]  I say we should have a lot of controlled demolition of the city council.
[01:02:47.479 --> 01:02:50.380]  They say the police department isn't viable.
[01:02:51.061 --> 01:02:52.642]  But seriously, this is going on.
[01:02:53.822 --> 01:02:54.142]  And so...
[01:02:55.202 --> 01:03:05.327]  They're going to try to have the police out there as a threat to arrest you if you get in Barton Creek that comes out of the springs, goes for about 300 yards, and then runs into the river.
[01:03:05.587 --> 01:03:07.308]  They can't stop anybody!
[01:03:07.688 --> 01:03:09.969]  The police, I guarantee you, know it's unenforceable.
[01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.930]  It's unlawful.
[01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:15.132]  So, I'll be there 12 noon tomorrow.
[01:03:16.212 --> 01:03:21.415]  I'm not going to say what restaurant has agreed to drive a truck up and deliver us 500 sandwiches.
[01:03:23.527 --> 01:03:24.828]  People don't want food to come out of this.
[01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:26.569]  I just want us to all have a communal event together.
[01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:28.870]  This isn't like loaves and fishes.
[01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.111]  This is just us having fun.
[01:03:31.292 --> 01:03:32.292]  But this is crazy.
[01:03:32.332 --> 01:03:33.993]  In 2020, you've got to do this.
[01:03:37.535 --> 01:03:40.697]  We have to do this in America.
[01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:43.979]  It's absolutely, totally insane.
[01:03:43.999 --> 01:03:44.960]  Dr. McKim, shot please.
[01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:47.902]  Here's Barton Creek that comes in right here.
[01:03:49.622 --> 01:03:54.845]  And then it goes under a spillway and gets diverted, but this is the spring that's dammed up.
[01:03:55.346 --> 01:04:01.910]  We're all gonna meet right over here by the Pagan Grove picnic area and Zilker Park.
[01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:02.450]  It's all beautiful.
[01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.391]  They can't stop it.
[01:04:03.771 --> 01:04:04.692]  It's not closed.
[01:04:05.252 --> 01:04:06.513]  This has not been closed.
[01:04:06.793 --> 01:04:09.094]  They're just saying it's closed because we're coming.
[01:04:09.995 --> 01:04:11.176]  They'd already reopened all this.
[01:04:13.752 --> 01:04:14.833]  It's all color of law.
[01:04:15.533 --> 01:04:20.017]  Here's Savannah Hernandez as part of her report to Sipandot Video, and I'll see you tomorrow high noon.
[01:04:20.197 --> 01:04:21.858]  We'll be back after the break, but here's Savannah Hernandez.
[01:04:27.582 --> 01:04:28.343]  Martin Springs tomorrow.
[01:04:31.765 --> 01:04:33.266]  Don't piss Savannah Hernandez off.
[01:04:36.028 --> 01:04:40.732]  Hey guy, how'd you get in there?
[01:04:41.923 --> 01:04:44.185]  They must have just put this up because this was flat.
[01:04:44.205 --> 01:04:45.506]  Like, today?
[01:04:45.747 --> 01:04:46.307]  This morning?
[01:04:46.507 --> 01:04:47.528]  Yeah, like 30 minutes ago.
[01:04:47.788 --> 01:04:48.349]  Really?
[01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:49.550]  Yeah.
[01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:50.251]  Just go under it.
[01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:56.372]  Okay guys, so as you can see, no one in Austin gives a damn about this blockade.
[01:04:56.712 --> 01:04:59.072]  So, I want to point something out to you guys.
[01:04:59.192 --> 01:05:02.913]  Now, Alex went viral on Twitter because he was at Barton Springs.
[01:05:02.953 --> 01:05:03.654]  They wouldn't let him in.
[01:05:03.694 --> 01:05:05.234]  Apparently, you now need a reservation.
[01:05:05.814 --> 01:05:07.835]  But, this is the free side of Barton Springs.
[01:05:07.855 --> 01:05:09.215]  There's a pay side and a free side.
[01:05:09.435 --> 01:05:10.355]  This is the free side.
[01:05:10.596 --> 01:05:12.656]  It's just a part of nature, just like Zilker Park.
[01:05:12.836 --> 01:05:15.317]  It's a big-ass grass field where people can go.
[01:05:15.777 --> 01:05:17.178]  And this is the free side of Barton.
[01:05:17.618 --> 01:05:20.540]  And we have this huge freaking thing here.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.062]  So I'm just gonna, you know, public service right now.
[01:05:25.043 --> 01:05:26.384]  I'm sorry, but someone's got to do it.
[01:05:28.746 --> 01:05:29.887]  Is this a crime?
[01:05:30.507 --> 01:05:31.648]  Oh look, the lifeguards are coming.
[01:05:31.668 --> 01:05:31.948]  Oh sh**.
[01:05:37.748 --> 01:05:41.909]  Hey guys, so we're now in the free side of Barton and did you guys see how easy that was?
[01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:46.671]  No face masks, no fines, no police officers, no one's stopping us from doing this.
[01:05:46.951 --> 01:05:47.231]  Why?
[01:05:47.451 --> 01:05:55.674]  Because this is nature and we in Austin, the people who pay, the taxpayers who pay for all of these natural parks, should be able to access them.
[01:05:55.934 --> 01:05:58.915]  So here we are in Barton now and as you guys can see in front of me,
[01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:00.595]  There's so many people in here.
[01:06:00.936 --> 01:06:01.156]  Why?
[01:06:01.396 --> 01:06:06.257]  Because nobody cares about these mandates anymore for COVID-19.
[01:06:06.557 --> 01:06:07.678]  Everyone knows it's ridiculous.
[01:06:07.918 --> 01:06:09.658]  There's no overrun hospitals here in Austin.
[01:06:09.898 --> 01:06:11.279]  People are not dying in the streets.
[01:06:11.819 --> 01:06:16.860]  And people should be able to go outside for their own personal health and experience nature.
[01:06:21.122 --> 01:06:28.764]  You know, guys, I've been stuck inside of my apartment for the past three months because of Mayor Adler's bullsh** lockdown orders, and it's time to rage.
[01:06:34.867 --> 01:06:35.687]  America!
[01:06:36.588 --> 01:06:37.308]  Oh, America!
[01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:39.209]  This is real civil disobedience, folks.
[01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.789]  He's criminal.
[01:06:39.809 --> 01:06:40.610]  Where's your mask, sir?
[01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:41.370]  Sir, where's your mask?
[01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:42.571]  They're trying to block everything.
[01:06:42.731 --> 01:06:43.771]  He just hits the end of the world.
[01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:44.632]  Arrest him.
[01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:45.312]  Arrest him now.
[01:06:45.352 --> 01:06:51.675]  And Michelle Obama is telling us that it's never going to end if we vote Trump.
[01:06:52.115 --> 01:06:57.137]  They're doing all this to make us feel depressed, to make us feel sad, and then they admit they are.
[01:06:58.578 --> 01:07:00.359]  Action 7 opens Barton Springs to the public.
[01:07:01.212 --> 01:07:04.174]  I saw Savannah do this a few days after I went down there to another part of it.
[01:07:04.774 --> 01:07:06.716]  Some desolate, you know, corner where I go hiking.
[01:07:06.736 --> 01:07:09.117]  I'm like, why did I lead people to where I go hiking for 10 miles?
[01:07:09.698 --> 01:07:12.600]  Sorry, this is 50 yards from the parking.
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.301]  100 yards max.
[01:07:14.761 --> 01:07:16.402]  And there's no steep grades, no nothing.
[01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:19.785]  There's plenty of rocks and stuff to break your ankles, so, you know, be safe.
[01:07:20.725 --> 01:07:24.448]  But they've tried to close all of this, and I'm not putting up with it.
[01:07:24.888 --> 01:07:25.729]  And I'm going swimming.
[01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.090]  The free side of Martin Springs has always been fun.
[01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:30.052]  I've been going there since I was three years old.
[01:07:31.502 --> 01:07:36.147]  And again, they dammed it up, they charge you at the park, now they don't want you to go to the free part.
[01:07:36.247 --> 01:07:42.414]  What a bunch of control freaks having a big emergency meeting at Austin Parks and Recreation about how they must stop Austinites.
[01:07:43.094 --> 01:07:48.500]  Oh, they want people to burn down the police station and kill people and run checkpoints and antifa, but oh my gosh!
[01:07:49.261 --> 01:07:50.983]  Austinites, you don't go get in the water!
[01:07:54.119 --> 01:07:56.060]  If they try to block me, I'm not going to stop the police.
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:00.923]  I'm going to go down and put a mask and snorkel on and swim up it and come in like a Navy SEAL!
[01:08:01.003 --> 01:08:03.684]  Of course, Navy SEALs can't really swim most of the time, but I can.
[01:08:04.044 --> 01:08:06.506]  So, that's all coming up tomorrow!
[01:08:06.746 --> 01:08:07.226]  Woo!
[01:08:07.546 --> 01:08:08.307]  I want to see you there.
[01:08:08.347 --> 01:08:09.267]  This is going to be fun!
[01:08:09.567 --> 01:08:09.908]  Fun!
[01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:10.568]  Fun!
[01:08:10.828 --> 01:08:11.188]  Fun!
[01:08:11.448 --> 01:08:11.749]  Fun!
[01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:12.509]  High noon!
[01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:13.109]  Hoo!
[01:08:13.329 --> 01:08:13.489]  Hoo!
[01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:13.910]  Hoo!
[01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:14.090]  Hoo!
[01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.350]  Hoo!
[01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:15.511]  Welcome back!
[01:08:17.151 --> 01:08:21.514]  Alright, I got a lot of international news, a lot of national news, a lot of really important stuff to cover.
[01:08:24.218 --> 01:08:27.479]  But I need to put bookends on what I just covered earlier.
[01:08:28.699 --> 01:08:33.820]  The city of Austin has declared a secret Parks and Recreation Department emergency.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.220]  That's what they're calling it.
[01:08:36.021 --> 01:08:44.863]  A secret emergency that we went down last weekend with over 200 people and marched down a trail and jumped in Barton Creek.
[01:08:46.863 --> 01:08:51.284]  And showed how it's totally empty and no one was there in the middle of huge canyons and woods.
[01:08:53.499 --> 01:09:08.512]  And so I said, let's go to the Barton Springs itself, where it's pouring out, where it's cold, where there's a paid park area that then spillways over for 300 yards into the Colorado River, where people are always there with their dogs, always swimming, always having fun.
[01:09:09.192 --> 01:09:10.694]  And we talked to the folks inside.
[01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:11.074]  They called us.
[01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:12.135]  They said, it's incredible.
[01:09:13.831 --> 01:09:17.053]  They're acting like the Comanches are coming to scalp everybody.
[01:09:17.593 --> 01:09:26.639]  They're asking for police and they want, you know, all the security and they want to stop from going even near the river or near the springs.
[01:09:28.721 --> 01:09:30.862]  Even though everybody just ignores it and it's already down there.
[01:09:32.063 --> 01:09:34.344]  So that's us upstream from it.
[01:09:34.664 --> 01:09:37.266]  Under that is a big aquifer.
[01:09:38.547 --> 01:09:43.110]  Under where the creek is, is an aquifer of 68 degree water that comes out by the Colorado.
[01:09:44.807 --> 01:09:46.431]  That's where we're going, downtown Austin.
[01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:54.969]  But imagine that, where they're having full meetings, hundreds of people just scared that their hoax is being called.
[01:09:58.114 --> 01:09:59.415]  They tried to close the parks for months.
[01:09:59.455 --> 01:10:00.335]  Everybody just showed up.
[01:10:00.675 --> 01:10:07.159]  So now they make you COVID register and come over, get your name and put you in a database, then count you as a COVID person, run scams on you.
[01:10:07.539 --> 01:10:10.180]  It's the left becoming law enforcement is what it is.
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.361]  And the police understand this.
[01:10:11.781 --> 01:10:12.802]  They know it's illegal.
[01:10:12.822 --> 01:10:13.442]  It's unlawful.
[01:10:14.102 --> 01:10:16.924]  And the word is the police are not going to enforce their wish to arrest people.
[01:10:16.944 --> 01:10:18.885]  But if I got arrested tomorrow, so be it.
[01:10:19.909 --> 01:10:22.011]  Rosa Parks got arrested for not sitting at the back of the bus.
[01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:23.052]  I get arrested.
[01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:25.214]  You know, it's bad enough to sit at the back of the bus.
[01:10:25.455 --> 01:10:26.936]  How about you can't even get on a bus?
[01:10:27.677 --> 01:10:29.399]  And that's another key thing I haven't gotten to.
[01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.464]  I'll cover it next segment because I'm just too flustered right now.
[01:10:36.141 --> 01:10:37.342]  I get so much data during the breaks.
[01:10:37.423 --> 01:10:38.043]  It's nobody's fault.
[01:10:38.063 --> 01:10:43.850]  It's just like processing it all, because I get told all this in like a break, and I run out and don't tell you.
[01:10:44.391 --> 01:10:47.234]  They're declared on a secret emergency?
[01:10:47.935 --> 01:10:53.100]  And the stuff I was hearing, I mean, it's just... And then I saw the text messages.
[01:10:54.241 --> 01:11:01.763]  From the Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, how starting by next year, if you don't take all the inoculations, whatever the U.N.
[01:11:01.803 --> 01:11:03.524]  says, it says, whatever the U.N.
[01:11:03.564 --> 01:11:05.504]  says, you can't leave your house.
[01:11:06.004 --> 01:11:09.125]  Well, what happens when your power gets turned off?
[01:11:09.145 --> 01:11:10.125]  They're going to evict you.
[01:11:10.185 --> 01:11:12.826]  I mean, the mark of the beast is like, here.
[01:11:14.767 --> 01:11:19.128]  So, God, I knew the new ruler was coming, but man, if they'd have told me.
[01:11:22.773 --> 01:11:25.174]  Well, I mean, they did say they'd lock her right down under a virus hoax.
[01:11:25.194 --> 01:11:25.794]  They're on record.
[01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:26.835]  That's why I made films about it.
[01:11:26.875 --> 01:11:29.796]  But it's one thing to read about it.
[01:11:31.896 --> 01:11:33.597]  It's another thing to be there.
[01:11:37.799 --> 01:11:41.340]  And to actually have your wife come home.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.941]  And I'm cooking eggs and pancakes for the children.
[01:11:45.842 --> 01:11:48.202]  And she comes in at nine, you know, going, well, whatever.
[01:11:48.243 --> 01:11:49.643]  They tried to throw me out of the park.
[01:11:50.283 --> 01:11:50.903]  The green belt.
[01:11:50.944 --> 01:11:51.464]  I'm like, huh?
[01:11:52.902 --> 01:11:54.723]  It's just, it's ridiculous.
[01:11:55.843 --> 01:11:57.243]  And it's all based on lies.
[01:11:57.923 --> 01:11:59.364]  And they admit it's based on lies.
[01:12:01.664 --> 01:12:02.244]  Let me do this.
[01:12:08.126 --> 01:12:13.787]  I'm ready to cover this, but I've got like four stacks I've got to get lined up during the break to make sure I hit every piece of this, because it all ties together.
[01:12:13.807 --> 01:12:19.989]  Just today's news is again a painting, a seismic chart, a gestalt.
[01:12:21.493 --> 01:12:21.713]  I don't
[01:12:45.717 --> 01:12:47.359]  I'd say, actually, you can have my left arm.
[01:12:47.819 --> 01:12:49.901]  You're just not going to control what I say.
[01:12:50.301 --> 01:13:00.010]  In fact, if some billionaire came along and said, here's $500 million, whatever you want, but I want your left arm, I'd say, chop that sucker off right now.
[01:13:00.351 --> 01:13:01.372]  Get the surgeon ready.
[01:13:03.493 --> 01:13:05.375]  Because I could wage war on them.
[01:13:05.395 --> 01:13:07.817]  And here's the thing.
[01:13:08.277 --> 01:13:09.018]  Cars are nice.
[01:13:09.338 --> 01:13:10.119]  Houses are nice.
[01:13:10.139 --> 01:13:11.080]  But it's about security.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:11.740]  I don't worship them.
[01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:22.870]  Money put into films and reporters and justice and freedom and staying alive when they want to shut you down and challenging them and then having victory almost every time we fight back.
[01:13:23.271 --> 01:13:24.572]  I just want to be on that field, baby.
[01:13:26.365 --> 01:13:27.786]  I want you to keep me on that field.
[01:13:27.866 --> 01:13:30.527]  And I want to promote prosperity for everybody and justice.
[01:13:31.308 --> 01:13:32.668]  And I'll just be quite frank with you.
[01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:33.529]  I'm not fatalistic.
[01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:37.271]  But when you get to this level of the fight, you become fatalistic.
[01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:39.412]  You become very good friends with death.
[01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:41.693]  And I'll never commit suicide.
[01:13:41.733 --> 01:13:43.434]  My God, I'll be like Darth Vader trying to stay alive.
[01:13:43.674 --> 01:13:44.755]  But I don't fear the death.
[01:13:46.516 --> 01:13:48.917]  They put a gun to my head and told me to support their Satanism.
[01:13:48.937 --> 01:13:50.258]  I'd say, you pull that trigger.
[01:13:51.633 --> 01:13:53.475]  Because that's my integrity.
[01:13:53.515 --> 01:13:54.896]  That's not heroism.
[01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:56.537]  That's not power.
[01:13:56.597 --> 01:13:58.058]  That's who I am.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.761]  It's not heroic.
[01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:01.882]  It's not stoic.
[01:14:01.942 --> 01:14:03.143]  It's not manly.
[01:14:03.243 --> 01:14:04.204]  It's who you are.
[01:14:04.224 --> 01:14:06.445]  I mean, that's simple.
[01:14:06.485 --> 01:14:07.546]  That's not hard.
[01:14:07.566 --> 01:14:13.691]  And we need people to wake up to who they are and what they were and who they'll be and just say, I am this thing.
[01:14:13.832 --> 01:14:15.073]  I do not bow to your evil.
[01:14:15.353 --> 01:14:16.414]  I do not submit to you.
[01:14:18.319 --> 01:14:21.701]  You're going to hit that point where, well, I don't want to be standoutish.
[01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:22.701]  I don't want to be arrogant.
[01:14:22.781 --> 01:14:25.023]  I don't want to, you're not doing it for arrogance.
[01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:27.444]  You're not doing it for narcissism.
[01:14:27.464 --> 01:14:29.525]  You're not doing it to be a big wheel.
[01:14:30.005 --> 01:14:32.226]  You're doing it because you're under attack and you have to be a leader.
[01:14:33.467 --> 01:14:36.769]  And that doesn't matter how small the leadership is or how big the leadership is.
[01:14:37.389 --> 01:14:43.152]  Just get on the path to being yourself and what God told you to do instead of being led by the devil.
[01:14:45.193 --> 01:14:46.014]  So it's very simple.
[01:14:47.076 --> 01:14:53.861]  We have products you need that are amazing and game changing, and I'm mad at myself all the time that I forget to take them because I was never a supplement person.
[01:14:54.181 --> 01:14:55.382]  I was never a vitamin person.
[01:14:55.642 --> 01:14:56.803]  I was never a mineral person.
[01:14:57.104 --> 01:15:03.909]  I was the guy that ran six miles almost every day and lifted weights and would go to the Chinese buffet and eat 14 plates of food.
[01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:07.211]  Well, not 14, but like eight plates of food.
[01:15:09.773 --> 01:15:14.797]  But as I got older and didn't have that energy, I learned what got me going and what boosted me.
[01:15:16.476 --> 01:15:28.799]  And when I habituate doing it, my life's better, taking the X2, taking the DNA Force Plus, taking the, nobody bought it, so we discontinued it, but my God, gut fusion is incredible, what it did for my life, my energy.
[01:15:29.459 --> 01:15:34.880]  I mean, I was like, I was 15 years old again when it came to the sex department, because it just creates those amino acids in your guts.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.540]  There's only certain things, only made in your intestines, folks.
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:42.001]  That's why you need the, we have something that does some similar things still, because people like it, so we still have it.
[01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:44.782]  Sometimes the best stuff, people don't order it, so it just goes away.
[01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:54.336]  And that, of course, is something people should take advantage of and really take action on.
[01:15:55.116 --> 01:15:57.758]  But we have a lot of big specials going in InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:15:58.219 --> 01:16:00.240]  They had sold out of the black blocket pockets.
[01:16:00.981 --> 01:16:02.042]  More get in next week.
[01:16:02.142 --> 01:16:03.043]  They finally made more.
[01:16:03.423 --> 01:16:10.649]  That way, these little privacy pockets, when you go out and you're not being tracked by the globalists, and they absolutely hate it when you do that.
[01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:15.323]  We also have the Ultimate Fish Oil, back in stock, discounted, free shipping.
[01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:18.826]  Survival Shield X2 Niacin Iodine, back in stock, free shipping.
[01:16:19.286 --> 01:16:23.108]  Prostagard with the Saw Palmetto and Zinc, back in stock, plus free shipping, $19.95.
[01:16:23.489 --> 01:16:25.130]  That's an incredible formula.
[01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:28.952]  Very close to what it cost us to produce it and advertise it and get it out.
[01:16:29.573 --> 01:16:33.595]  We have a lot of other big specials going as well, and I just didn't plug them properly, so I'm just not going to plug them.
[01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:37.438]  We have the Everyday Essentials Specials.
[01:16:38.749 --> 01:16:43.592]  What happens is I go crazy when I can't remember a product name because I'm teleprompter free.
[01:16:43.612 --> 01:16:45.093]  So I've got an OCD about it.
[01:16:45.113 --> 01:16:47.214]  I used to have a photographic memory but now I'm older so I don't.
[01:16:48.295 --> 01:16:55.900]  And so I'm sitting there trying to remember the name of our anti-parasite gut flush product that's beyond a probiotic.
[01:16:57.287 --> 01:17:00.669]  And it drives me insane, not to be able to remember the name of it.
[01:17:00.729 --> 01:17:01.209]  What is that?
[01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:03.351]  It's not APEC Power Stack.
[01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:04.251]  It's not Survival Shield.
[01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:04.992]  It's not Opal Fish Oil.
[01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:06.693]  It's not Survival Shield.
[01:17:06.733 --> 01:17:07.433]  It's not Prostacard.
[01:17:07.453 --> 01:17:08.654]  It's not Krill Oil.
[01:17:08.674 --> 01:17:10.695]  It's not Alexa Pure Breeze, for God's sake.
[01:17:11.536 --> 01:17:13.297]  What is the name of that product?
[01:17:14.257 --> 01:17:15.138]  Sure, none of them can tell me.
[01:17:15.158 --> 01:17:15.538]  See how this is?
[01:17:15.558 --> 01:17:16.699]  I'm not mad.
[01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:17.680]  There's just no one can tell me.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:18.400]  No one can tell me.
[01:17:19.381 --> 01:17:24.044]  I won't be able to rest until I know the name of this product.
[01:17:24.064 --> 01:17:24.524]  Good God.
[01:17:27.096 --> 01:17:29.917]  The fall of the New World Order is almost here.
[01:17:30.657 --> 01:17:34.798]  But first, we're going to make them emerge and launch their full attack.
[01:17:35.598 --> 01:17:38.819]  And then by attrition, we are going to destroy them.
[01:17:39.659 --> 01:17:42.680]  And our destruction in the process will be a holy act!
[01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:50.603]  Yes, the pedophile Satanists who don't know God or themselves are defenseless!
[01:17:52.023 --> 01:17:55.624]  When you run for cover, we're not running for cover.
[01:17:57.190 --> 01:17:58.791]  Escape is not our plan.
[01:18:00.071 --> 01:18:01.112]  You can't retreat.
[01:18:03.773 --> 01:18:08.554]  I spy, the people spy, God spies, like no other!
[01:18:09.515 --> 01:18:10.515]  The real intent!
[01:18:10.755 --> 01:18:12.176]  We see you, Satanists!
[01:18:12.836 --> 01:18:13.836]  Alright, let's get into it right now.
[01:18:18.258 --> 01:18:19.879]  We can run forever.
[01:18:23.109 --> 01:18:24.050]  The enemy doesn't have that.
[01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:24.990]  They can't run forever.
[01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:29.711]  They have their little productions, their little fake events, their little... It's nothing.
[01:18:30.432 --> 01:18:34.873]  Not like the giant thermonuclear hydrogen reactors of a sun exploding.
[01:18:35.373 --> 01:18:36.553]  A controlled explosion.
[01:18:37.414 --> 01:18:38.914]  Trillions of years of energy.
[01:18:39.494 --> 01:18:42.075]  Nothing you can even begin to deal with satanists.
[01:18:42.895 --> 01:18:45.676]  So you murder children all day long, you're gonna pay.
[01:18:45.696 --> 01:18:47.917]  Alright, let's get into it right now.
[01:18:50.134 --> 01:18:52.870]  How their heartbeat runs when they run for cover.
[01:18:54.093 --> 01:18:54.633]  Look at this.
[01:18:55.654 --> 01:18:57.775]  Look at this filthy, disgusting behavior.
[01:18:58.315 --> 01:19:01.537]  American Airlines is dropping service to 15 cities.
[01:19:01.957 --> 01:19:04.718]  This is likely only the beginning, CNN.
[01:19:05.179 --> 01:19:07.460]  The breakdown of general services.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:21.227]  It took hundreds of years of renaissance to build up to this incredible opulence and human freedom you have with automobiles and science and medical and technology and eyeglasses and contact lenses and microchips.
[01:19:22.543 --> 01:19:29.966]  And the very groups hijacked it all, now telling you world government will deliver you everything, when it's designed to take it all away!
[01:19:30.186 --> 01:19:33.367]  Because they don't want you to be empowered!
[01:19:35.508 --> 01:19:36.068]  Here's another one.
[01:19:37.346 --> 01:19:38.146]  I'll play this clip in a moment.
[01:19:38.226 --> 01:19:41.128]  Entrepreneur, New York City is dead and not coming back.
[01:19:41.508 --> 01:19:42.548]  That's the plan.
[01:19:42.969 --> 01:19:47.471]  They have to now unleash the hordes like a university they brainwashed, a city they brainwashed.
[01:19:47.891 --> 01:19:50.432]  Those fleeing, the rats leaving, don't know why they fled.
[01:19:50.712 --> 01:19:57.816]  They carry the bubonic plague, the lice, the spiritual fleas that carry the plague.
[01:19:58.683 --> 01:20:03.164]  They're only the vectors, the harbingers.
[01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:07.486]  They're only the angels that deliver the venom.
[01:20:09.326 --> 01:20:12.647]  As if the fangs go into your thigh from a king cobra.
[01:20:12.927 --> 01:20:14.008]  They are not the venom.
[01:20:14.308 --> 01:20:16.248]  They are the delivery system.
[01:20:18.309 --> 01:20:20.329]  And you say to yourself, oh, it's so horrible.
[01:20:20.569 --> 01:20:21.890]  They destroy everything.
[01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:25.191]  And they go, yes, we do, because they come to destroy you.
[01:20:27.332 --> 01:20:28.673]  You say, please don't destroy me.
[01:20:28.693 --> 01:20:38.118]  I remember one time I was at like a 2000 and no in 1996 at a big smart growth conference in Austin and I was there for days.
[01:20:38.178 --> 01:20:47.083]  I paid to go and they had all these big tech people and I'm like, but they're taking poor people's ranches and farms and you're abusing people and this is illegal and why would you want to hurt people?
[01:20:47.524 --> 01:20:49.265]  And I remember they looked at me and the camera wasn't on.
[01:20:49.285 --> 01:20:50.425]  They go, you idiot.
[01:20:50.505 --> 01:20:51.466]  Of course we are.
[01:20:53.595 --> 01:21:00.238]  There was a famous Dallas Cowboy did that, and he was just all satanic and into himself, and he just brushed aside me.
[01:21:00.678 --> 01:21:01.118]  White guy.
[01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:03.559]  Like he was just, ha ha!
[01:21:03.579 --> 01:21:04.600]  Of course he are!
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:05.100]  Ha ha!
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.461]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:21:08.982 --> 01:21:09.762]  That's the attitude.
[01:21:13.904 --> 01:21:16.145]  You're like, hey, what you're, you know, what you're doing is illegal.
[01:21:16.185 --> 01:21:18.626]  It's stealing and it's, of course it is, you idiot!
[01:21:19.366 --> 01:21:20.186]  Get out of my way!
[01:21:22.509 --> 01:21:24.210]  And that assurity of the Satanist.
[01:21:25.731 --> 01:21:26.511]  That arrogance.
[01:21:27.312 --> 01:21:29.192]  Them, them, them, only them.
[01:21:29.533 --> 01:21:36.536]  Not aggressive, not dominant, not alpha standing up for yourself, but also building something good, but just wanting to screw people.
[01:21:36.876 --> 01:21:37.417]  Loving it!
[01:21:37.777 --> 01:21:40.198]  Anyone that deserves it, gets it.
[01:21:40.338 --> 01:21:42.239]  And deserving it just means you can do it.
[01:21:45.421 --> 01:21:47.442]  Deserving just means they can get away with it.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.421]  And imagine that's the allegory of you get in a public pool and go, well, I could just take a dump in here.
[01:21:55.442 --> 01:21:58.682]  By the time they figure it out, I'll get out.
[01:21:58.743 --> 01:21:59.983]  Yeah, I think I'm going to go home now.
[01:22:00.323 --> 01:22:01.703]  I'm not going to use this pool for a couple of weeks.
[01:22:01.763 --> 01:22:03.624]  Just take a dump in the pool.
[01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:05.325]  That's that's Satanism.
[01:22:05.785 --> 01:22:08.205]  Satanism equals taking a dump in the public pool.
[01:22:08.225 --> 01:22:11.526]  I mean, they're not just pissing in the public pool, folks.
[01:22:11.766 --> 01:22:14.467]  They're taking a dump in the public pool and they like it.
[01:22:16.268 --> 01:22:19.729]  Because they like getting in their car and watch everybody freak out as they drive away.
[01:22:21.052 --> 01:22:22.213]  That's their little treat.
[01:22:22.933 --> 01:22:26.575]  But see, when they do that enough, there's no public pools anymore for them to even go to.
[01:22:26.855 --> 01:22:30.537]  Because enough people start doing it, it becomes a toilet.
[01:22:30.977 --> 01:22:31.817]  And then it closes.
[01:22:32.078 --> 01:22:32.918]  And that's their answer.
[01:22:32.938 --> 01:22:35.259]  Oh yeah, we're closing the whole human system.
[01:22:35.539 --> 01:22:36.240]  It's all gone.
[01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:39.487]  So here's the headline, and I'll play this clip before I get back to the news.
[01:22:39.927 --> 01:22:42.468]  Biden vows to guide U.S.
[01:22:42.548 --> 01:22:43.368]  out of darkness.
[01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:44.809]  Who created the race riots?
[01:22:45.149 --> 01:22:49.970]  Who created the lockdowns and the rolling power outages and the depression?
[01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:50.931]  Who did it all?
[01:22:51.071 --> 01:22:51.391]  Them!
[01:22:53.111 --> 01:23:03.635]  But Big Mike, Michael Obama, I'm sorry, Michelle Obama, says, oh, you think things are bad?
[01:23:03.675 --> 01:23:06.116]  They're a lot worse unless you give in to us.
[01:23:06.236 --> 01:23:06.716]  Here she is.
[01:23:09.181 --> 01:23:12.963]  So if you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this.
[01:23:14.164 --> 01:23:23.469]  If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can and they will if we don't make a change in this election.
[01:23:24.409 --> 01:23:32.334]  If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.
[01:23:33.848 --> 01:23:35.510]  Because the pedo rings are going down.
[01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:37.271]  Their foundation's going down.
[01:23:37.291 --> 01:23:39.854]  Their sellout to Islam and Communist China's going down.
[01:23:39.874 --> 01:23:41.415]  So their lives do depend on it.
[01:23:42.796 --> 01:23:44.078]  But let's keep going through these headlines.
[01:23:44.438 --> 01:23:47.901]  American Airlines is dropping service to at least 15 cities CNN celebrates.
[01:23:48.282 --> 01:23:49.183]  They say probably for good.
[01:23:49.623 --> 01:23:52.085]  Entrepreneur New York City is dead and not coming back.
[01:23:53.707 --> 01:23:56.650]  Joe Biden vows national mask mandate if elected president.
[01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:57.951]  A total cult.
[01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:02.713]  Because if they can get people to bully you to do one order, they'll bully you to do the next order.
[01:24:03.073 --> 01:24:04.394]  They're trying to get the mob going.
[01:24:04.835 --> 01:24:07.237]  I have a right to make sure that my home is secure.
[01:24:07.517 --> 01:24:17.206]  Chicago Mayor Lightfoot defends ban on protest, and defunding of police, and banning guns for citizens, but says she is important.
[01:24:17.927 --> 01:24:19.368]  You're like, well that sounds oxymoronic.
[01:24:19.428 --> 01:24:22.110]  No, it's about her teaching you you have no hope.
[01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:23.951]  She goes, I'm important.
[01:24:24.031 --> 01:24:25.012]  I get to have my hair cut.
[01:24:25.032 --> 01:24:26.393]  Remember a few months ago?
[01:24:26.413 --> 01:24:27.113]  But you don't.
[01:24:27.793 --> 01:24:28.814]  You're like, that's discrediting.
[01:24:28.854 --> 01:24:29.234]  No, no, no.
[01:24:29.695 --> 01:24:34.458]  When you reach this point, it's like Shelchescu in Romania saying, I get power at my palace.
[01:24:34.798 --> 01:24:35.899]  We have electricity.
[01:24:36.919 --> 01:24:38.641]  But the rest of you don't get electricity.
[01:24:42.123 --> 01:24:43.944]  Don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining.
[01:24:43.964 --> 01:24:45.445]  But that's what they do, folks.
[01:24:45.905 --> 01:24:46.646]  It's a cult.
[01:24:50.714 --> 01:24:55.318]  Call of Duty features Soviet defector, a new trailer exposing the new World of Takeover.
[01:24:55.798 --> 01:25:06.107]  Flashback next features ten-year-old trans kid as a top in explicitly sexual terms as they're led into a sex dungeon by a goblin creature dressed as a woman.
[01:25:07.328 --> 01:25:07.448]  Ugh.
[01:25:09.069 --> 01:25:13.613]  I mean, it's just, it's just out in the open.
[01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:16.770]  Savannah Hernandez went out and asked, how long will you wear a mask?
[01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:19.271]  He said, however long it says I'm a hero.
[01:25:19.291 --> 01:25:22.572]  Because they don't have a life, they don't have a future, they don't have an identity.
[01:25:22.792 --> 01:25:24.452]  The media said, wear this, you're a hero.
[01:25:24.472 --> 01:25:25.772]  Doesn't matter, it's all a fraud.
[01:25:26.032 --> 01:25:27.393]  They're a hero, you're not.
[01:25:30.773 --> 01:25:32.454]  They're a hero, you're not.
[01:25:36.694 --> 01:25:39.595]  And I've got all these other articles that are here in my stack.
[01:25:41.408 --> 01:25:46.091]  The deal with all this, and I'll be honest with you, I thought that was my COVID stack.
[01:25:46.131 --> 01:25:47.152]  It's not even my COVID stack.
[01:25:47.172 --> 01:25:48.373]  It's not a COVID stack.
[01:25:48.413 --> 01:25:49.914]  That was like a stack that had some COVID in it.
[01:25:50.494 --> 01:25:52.956]  It's the most insane garbage you've ever seen.
[01:25:53.536 --> 01:25:55.297]  And I'm going to find, oh, here's the COVID stack.
[01:25:55.357 --> 01:25:55.737]  Excuse me.
[01:25:56.498 --> 01:25:57.539]  Now I have the COVID stack.
[01:25:57.599 --> 01:25:58.019]  Excuse me.
[01:25:58.039 --> 01:26:01.861]  We're going to come back and hit that COVID stack when we have a guest here in studio.
[01:26:02.862 --> 01:26:08.286]  Separately, I was having one of those little nervous fits earlier because I couldn't remember the name of that product.
[01:26:08.686 --> 01:26:10.868]  It's got free shipping on it and it's still 50% off.
[01:26:11.368 --> 01:26:12.349]  Living Defense.
[01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:14.591]  This is beyond a probiotic.
[01:26:14.651 --> 01:26:21.315]  It's got all these things known to flush out the bad little visitors in the guts and really get your guts up to optimum condition.
[01:26:21.355 --> 01:26:23.097]  And have you ever thought probiotics were amazing?
[01:26:23.117 --> 01:26:23.457]  Which they are.
[01:26:23.817 --> 01:26:25.919]  This is next level and does it a different way.
[01:26:27.003 --> 01:26:28.564]  It targets and gets rid of bad guys.
[01:26:28.604 --> 01:26:30.025]  It doesn't promote the good guys.
[01:26:30.045 --> 01:26:33.167]  Because when you get rid of the bad guys, the good guys can operate.
[01:26:34.048 --> 01:26:35.268]  The New World Order is targeting your gut.
[01:26:35.489 --> 01:26:37.490]  Living Defense is the best, most powerful formula.
[01:26:37.930 --> 01:26:38.991]  And it is a big bottle.
[01:26:39.151 --> 01:26:40.192]  Let me show TV viewers this.
[01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:41.352]  It's a brand new bottle.
[01:26:43.254 --> 01:26:44.534]  Remember, I haven't taken this in about six months.
[01:26:45.135 --> 01:26:46.075]  I take it about twice a year.
[01:26:46.095 --> 01:26:47.576]  Look at this.
[01:26:48.977 --> 01:26:49.978]  Want to do an overhead shot for me?
[01:26:50.598 --> 01:26:51.179]  Look at that.
[01:26:52.299 --> 01:26:52.680]  Look at this.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.541]  There's so many of them.
[01:26:56.581 --> 01:26:56.961]  Hold on.
[01:26:56.981 --> 01:26:58.202]  There you go.
[01:26:58.322 --> 01:26:59.943]  I mean, once it's on the floor.
[01:27:00.663 --> 01:27:01.683]  These babies are amazing.
[01:27:01.703 --> 01:27:08.466]  You take a few of these a day for a month, you're going to have some results that are, let's just say, magnificent.
[01:27:09.687 --> 01:27:12.168]  And this is Mother Nature gave us.
[01:27:12.268 --> 01:27:13.288]  God gave us a Mother Nature.
[01:27:13.968 --> 01:27:17.110]  It is LivingDefenseInfoWarStore.com and you find the Info War.
[01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:19.551]  So it's a total win-win, win-win-win.
[01:27:20.051 --> 01:27:21.191]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:22.612]  Good evening.
[01:27:23.897 --> 01:27:29.221]  Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement, left us with this wisdom.
[01:27:30.401 --> 01:27:33.784]  Give people light, and they will find the way.
[01:27:34.784 --> 01:27:35.825]  Give people light.
[01:27:37.266 --> 01:27:38.847]  Those are words for our time.
[01:27:40.168 --> 01:27:44.011]  The current president has cloaked American darkness for much too long.
[01:27:46.112 --> 01:27:49.134]  Too much anger, too much fear, too much division.
[01:27:50.235 --> 01:27:52.677]  Here and now, I give you my word.
[01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:58.958]  If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst.
[01:27:59.899 --> 01:28:02.780]  I'll be an ally of the light, not the darkness.
[01:28:03.961 --> 01:28:10.225]  It's time for us, for we the people, to come together and make no mistake.
[01:28:11.125 --> 01:28:16.608]  United, we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America.
[01:28:17.649 --> 01:28:22.632]  We'll choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege.
[01:28:24.130 --> 01:28:25.191]  I'm a proud Democrat.
[01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:30.233]  And I'll be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election.
[01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:38.637]  So it's with great honor and humility, I accept this nomination for President of the United States of America.
[01:28:40.333 --> 01:28:45.258]  But while I'll be a Democratic... He had to fully focus for that 30 seconds to be able to say that.
[01:28:45.278 --> 01:28:48.661]  You can hear him really laboring, having big, big problems.
[01:28:49.081 --> 01:29:03.795]  I want to get into the real economic war and the real economic collapse coming up next segment because admitting it's happening will stop it and the people who engineered it will end up paying for what they've done so they won't use it to get more control and more power over us.
[01:29:03.835 --> 01:29:06.037]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:29:07.381 --> 01:29:10.322]  But first, let me bring up something here that I owe the listeners.
[01:29:12.903 --> 01:29:21.307]  I didn't tell Millie Weaver yesterday that I was no longer going to work with her after working with her for eight years because of the film Shadowgate.
[01:29:22.893 --> 01:29:26.254]  It was when the Shadowgate film got released, I didn't know what was in it.
[01:29:26.874 --> 01:29:31.215]  And then someone they sent over here to the office was saying things that I knew were patently not true.
[01:29:31.895 --> 01:29:40.877]  And when we brought up the things weren't true, what they said on air about Roger Stone working with General Jones and all this stuff, I tried to respond to them and they just acted like I was crazy.
[01:29:41.578 --> 01:29:47.439]  So then I saw the internet researching the people they're involved in, and I was so blown away by it.
[01:29:50.179 --> 01:29:55.661]  That I was like, this is so bad that if I talk about this, the media is going to attack me for it.
[01:29:56.881 --> 01:30:00.422]  But if I don't talk about it, I'm covering something up, and so I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:02.503]  That's how I work.
[01:30:04.004 --> 01:30:05.284]  I don't know what Millie's into.
[01:30:05.544 --> 01:30:06.844]  I want to think she's a good person.
[01:30:07.765 --> 01:30:12.106]  But the people she's involved with are some serious people.
[01:30:12.366 --> 01:30:12.926]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:30:14.841 --> 01:30:20.806]  They've been like sending us Punisher images on Twitter like that threatens us like when people threaten us we get scared or whatever you want the Punisher does.
[01:30:21.167 --> 01:30:21.827]  Okay, great.
[01:30:22.248 --> 01:30:25.451]  So I'll probably go further now because of that because you did that.
[01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:26.412]  That's a rule I have.
[01:30:27.232 --> 01:30:30.676]  But if you go to Band.video, I'm not going to cover this ever again.
[01:30:30.696 --> 01:30:31.576]  I'm not going to respond to it.
[01:30:32.898 --> 01:30:37.482]  The full Shadowgate film now has a write-up that I wrote this morning and then links to what
[01:30:38.956 --> 01:30:47.603]  Caitlin Bennett put out, separately from her own research, that we found, and best of our own belief is accurate, about the people that are involved.
[01:30:47.923 --> 01:30:57.211]  So we're not decoupling because of her getting arrested for reportedly a scuff up and a broken phone with her mom.
[01:30:57.931 --> 01:30:59.613]  And it's not because of the film Shadowgate.
[01:31:00.093 --> 01:31:02.635]  It's because once the film came out,
[01:31:03.649 --> 01:31:05.491]  People are like, do you know who these people are?
[01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:08.054]  And then separately they were attacking us at the same time.
[01:31:08.354 --> 01:31:13.400]  So I went and looked and I had it checked by experts and it was just like, are you kidding me?
[01:31:13.761 --> 01:31:18.646]  But this is what attaches itself to Q. This is what attaches itself to anybody that's successful.
[01:31:18.967 --> 01:31:20.048]  Millie is successful.
[01:31:20.388 --> 01:31:20.949]  She did well.
[01:31:20.969 --> 01:31:22.891]  We gave her total freedom and I'm done.
[01:31:23.191 --> 01:31:23.452]  In fact,
[01:31:24.935 --> 01:31:32.098]  On Monday, I'm going to take the Shadowgate film down and her channel, because it's my site, it's my operation, and I choose to not be associated with it.
[01:31:32.278 --> 01:31:33.218]  And not even because of the film.
[01:31:33.639 --> 01:31:38.340]  I just saw them making statements about, oh, he didn't fund our film, it's our film, so they're acting like they don't want it there.
[01:31:38.501 --> 01:31:38.941]  You got it.
[01:31:39.081 --> 01:31:40.081]  It'll be off the site Monday.
[01:31:40.281 --> 01:31:42.022]  People that want it can go see it, you can download it.
[01:31:42.562 --> 01:31:44.403]  They asked me today to take it down, I'll take it down right now, too.
[01:31:44.963 --> 01:31:45.663]  So, I'm done.
[01:31:45.683 --> 01:31:51.166]  I'll never talk about Millie Weaver again, and I'm just saying, I don't believe a word comes out of any of their mouths, and that's it.
[01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:55.048]  I mean, you couldn't write the script for this stuff.
[01:31:55.428 --> 01:31:56.949]  And I'm just, all I have is the truth.
[01:31:57.249 --> 01:31:57.950]  So I've done it here.
[01:31:58.270 --> 01:31:59.571]  So bon voyage, Millie!
[01:31:59.851 --> 01:32:01.272]  Have fun with those folks you're working with.
[01:32:01.292 --> 01:32:02.793]  I'm sure they'll treat you real good.
[01:32:05.034 --> 01:32:08.656]  But most companies now are encouraging workers to be remote.
[01:32:09.117 --> 01:32:12.199]  Citigroup, JP Morgan, Google, Twitter, Facebook.
[01:32:12.419 --> 01:32:17.602]  They want employees to be remote for maybe years or permanently.
[01:32:18.154 --> 01:32:37.025]  This completely damages not only the economic ecosystem of New York City, the restaurants, transportation, office buildings, commercial real estate, but what happens to the tax base when all of your workers can now live anywhere they want in the country, not even the suburbs.
[01:32:37.265 --> 01:32:41.988]  They're going to go to all of the cities like Nashville, Miami, Austin, Denver.
[01:32:42.268 --> 01:32:43.989]  They're leaving the city because they could
[01:32:44.749 --> 01:32:45.069]  We're going
[01:33:01.773 --> 01:33:03.034]  What's going to reverse that?
[01:33:03.114 --> 01:33:04.615]  It's only going to get worse.
[01:33:04.795 --> 01:33:04.975]  Yeah.
[01:33:05.315 --> 01:33:07.576]  Look, I mean, I think it's very sad, James.
[01:33:07.697 --> 01:33:10.758]  I mean, look, I've lived in the New York area for 40 years.
[01:33:11.159 --> 01:33:12.079]  I love this city.
[01:33:12.199 --> 01:33:13.640]  It is a truly great city.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:14.701]  I've lived in London.
[01:33:14.761 --> 01:33:17.582]  I've lived in all over the world in great cities.
[01:33:17.882 --> 01:33:19.363]  And this is a great city.
[01:33:19.603 --> 01:33:23.125]  And it grieves me to hear you say it's dead forever.
[01:33:23.686 --> 01:33:25.247]  Is there no hope at all?
[01:33:25.287 --> 01:33:27.448]  I mean, sure, it can come back a little bit, can't it?
[01:33:27.508 --> 01:33:28.809]  It just won't be like it was.
[01:33:30.097 --> 01:33:42.801]  Well look, I was born here, I've lived here for my whole adult life, and I have five kids in New York City, but yes, I don't think we're gonna see a return to the old New York.
[01:33:50.003 --> 01:33:52.584]  New York City's dead and it's not coming back.
[01:33:53.864 --> 01:33:55.805]  America's dead and it's not coming back.
[01:33:59.026 --> 01:33:59.466]  Unless...
[01:34:01.058 --> 01:34:02.940]  You totally break with the New World Order.
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:05.382]  Then everything will make sense.
[01:34:06.202 --> 01:34:09.165]  If you just research what I've told you, you won't be listening to me.
[01:34:09.385 --> 01:34:13.228]  You'll be reading the Rockefeller Foundation lockstep program.
[01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:15.269]  You'll be reading Agenda 21.
[01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:22.055]  And you'll look out your window, or you'll go to work, or you'll drive down the street, or you'll go to the store, and you will see it!
[01:34:24.457 --> 01:34:26.759]  You won't be listening to Alex Jones.
[01:34:28.851 --> 01:34:32.112]  You won't be listening to some leftist tell you there's KKK members around every corner.
[01:34:32.352 --> 01:34:34.353]  They don't exist in most areas.
[01:34:35.033 --> 01:34:38.255]  You'll be seeing it for yourself.
[01:34:41.596 --> 01:34:45.497]  It's like somebody telling you, hey, they got really good hamburgers over at that place.
[01:34:46.718 --> 01:34:48.298]  And you go there and it's a delicious hamburger.
[01:34:48.578 --> 01:34:50.079]  You heard it, but you had the hamburger.
[01:34:54.881 --> 01:34:59.683]  Or it's like the doctor telling you, yeah, you see that scan, you got a big brain tumor, you'll probably be dead in about three months.
[01:35:00.144 --> 01:35:00.664]  And you know what?
[01:35:00.684 --> 01:35:03.685]  A couple months later, you're sitting there dying and you're like, wow, that was true.
[01:35:05.306 --> 01:35:11.449]  You know, I don't sit up here and tell you all this because I want to scare you or because I think this is fun.
[01:35:13.330 --> 01:35:18.953]  I got into reading 37 years ago or so.
[01:35:18.973 --> 01:35:19.913]  I got into history books.
[01:35:21.674 --> 01:35:22.795]  And I was about nine years old.
[01:35:25.199 --> 01:35:26.900]  Cause I love science fiction.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:27.900]  I love comic books.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.801]  And then I picked up history books.
[01:35:31.321 --> 01:35:31.781]  Color.
[01:35:35.183 --> 01:35:38.464]  Time-life books that my dad got for me.
[01:35:39.044 --> 01:35:40.565]  And then he never bought me anything.
[01:35:40.625 --> 01:35:47.007]  I got like two pairs of shoes a year and you know, they wanted me to be frugal and I had to get a job when I was like 11.
[01:35:47.547 --> 01:35:49.288]  But man, if I wanted books, they got them for me.
[01:35:49.308 --> 01:35:53.870]  It was just, I had like, I had like 15, 20 color encyclopedias by the time I was about 10.
[01:35:55.928 --> 01:36:03.773]  And it was so incredible hearing about this siege, and the Chinese, or the Greeks, or the Russians, or the British Navy.
[01:36:04.173 --> 01:36:09.756]  I got a whole series when I was about 11 on the occult, time-life books, like 10 volumes.
[01:36:10.317 --> 01:36:12.058]  And I was reading about the whole history of the occult.
[01:36:12.378 --> 01:36:14.579]  It was pretty accurate, too, today, you know, to be an expert on it.
[01:36:18.581 --> 01:36:22.324]  And if you go to college and try to get an education on something today,
[01:36:23.271 --> 01:36:24.572]  You don't get an education on anything.
[01:36:24.852 --> 01:36:31.558]  It's all an education on how to fight with each other and how different ideas are weird and how you can only have this school of thought.
[01:36:31.838 --> 01:36:33.419]  You're being taught to be a slave.
[01:36:35.061 --> 01:36:41.806]  I got a classical education because my parents would buy me any book I wanted.
[01:36:44.869 --> 01:36:49.633]  And I told you the story where my mom dropped me off at the mall when I was like 13.
[01:36:52.281 --> 01:36:59.623]  And I walk in and went back and they had little bookstores and I said, where's your history section?
[01:36:59.643 --> 01:37:00.423]  Cause I couldn't find it.
[01:37:00.783 --> 01:37:02.524]  It turned out it was in a world at war section.
[01:37:03.004 --> 01:37:07.525]  And I bought Mein Kampf, a big orange covered thing with Hitler on the front.
[01:37:08.325 --> 01:37:11.986]  And I walk over to the woman and I hand it to her.
[01:37:12.006 --> 01:37:18.928]  It was a big paperback cover, but it was a big orange Mein Kampf, my struggle.
[01:37:19.649 --> 01:37:20.669]  And I handed it to her.
[01:37:21.912 --> 01:37:25.174]  And she got all scared, she's a white lady, but she goes, oh, oh.
[01:37:26.495 --> 01:37:26.915]  I go, what's wrong?
[01:37:26.935 --> 01:37:28.376]  She goes, you're not a Nazi, are you?
[01:37:30.357 --> 01:37:34.619]  And I remember, it's not wit, it's just that common sense of a young person that's informed.
[01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:37.160]  And I said, you're the one selling it, lady.
[01:37:37.641 --> 01:37:38.341]  What do you think?
[01:37:39.782 --> 01:37:43.023]  And then I realized I was handsome, I had blonde hair, I had blue eyes.
[01:37:44.144 --> 01:37:45.665]  I was wearing a white tucked in shirt.
[01:37:48.069 --> 01:37:56.276]  I was wearing blue jeans and tennis shoes, and because I was a good-looking white guy buying Mein Kampf, you can't really blame her thinking I was a Nazi.
[01:37:56.716 --> 01:38:03.001]  But again, people think reading and being informed is weird.
[01:38:03.522 --> 01:38:07.285]  I mean, that book was unreadable socialist dribble.
[01:38:11.308 --> 01:38:13.190]  Bitching about the Versailles Treaty.
[01:38:16.485 --> 01:38:22.308]  And it was designed to get the German aristocracy of the day to get in bed with Hitler.
[01:38:22.908 --> 01:38:23.488]  And it worked.
[01:38:24.348 --> 01:38:25.409]  But it was not a good book.
[01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:39.955]  And again, once you've read Hitler, you want to read Marx and Engels and Julius Caesar and Sun Tzu and everybody else.
[01:38:42.556 --> 01:38:44.137]  But you know I haven't read a book
[01:38:45.672 --> 01:38:47.013]  On Geopolitics in Years.
[01:38:47.853 --> 01:38:49.995]  I read hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[01:38:50.375 --> 01:38:52.477]  And I, I, hundreds and hundreds a year.
[01:38:52.797 --> 01:38:57.540]  I used to stay up till 2, 3 in the morning, most nights, because I had to read this book.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:58.981]  I had to read this book.
[01:38:59.341 --> 01:39:02.943]  I had to, I have to read every page of Carol Quigley's Strategy and Hope.
[01:39:02.963 --> 01:39:03.984]  All 1,120-something pages.
[01:39:04.344 --> 01:39:06.085]  And it was just, you know what it is?
[01:39:07.066 --> 01:39:20.669]  You don't get knowledge from them, you get how diseased it is, and how twisted it is, and how it's a bunch of sophistic garbage to placate the establishment, to act intellectual.
[01:39:21.209 --> 01:39:35.132]  So robber barons, whose granddaddy stole the money, read it and can't understand it, and so they then think, oh, this guy should be put in charge, because what they've created doesn't make sense.
[01:39:36.775 --> 01:39:39.157]  And see, that's how I learned the insanity of these people.
[01:39:39.457 --> 01:39:43.520]  And now you see the super-extreme production of that.
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:51.847]  I mean, I'd read some captain's report from a battle in the Nile with Napoleon.
[01:39:51.867 --> 01:39:52.787]  It made total sense.
[01:39:53.968 --> 01:39:54.349]  Eloquent.
[01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:55.289]  Well-written.
[01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:56.610]  You'd cross-reference.
[01:39:56.670 --> 01:39:57.431]  It was all accurate.
[01:39:57.451 --> 01:39:58.612]  Everything was about truth back then.
[01:39:58.632 --> 01:40:00.093]  Because if you lied once, don't lie never.
[01:40:00.253 --> 01:40:00.874]  People kill you.
[01:40:01.654 --> 01:40:02.295]  They want truth!
[01:40:02.635 --> 01:40:03.616]  You're dead, you lie!
[01:40:03.776 --> 01:40:04.777]  Death to liars!
[01:40:06.749 --> 01:40:10.771]  And you read the modern stuff, none of it makes any sense because it's not meant to be truthful.
[01:40:10.831 --> 01:40:11.971]  It's all just deception.
[01:40:13.492 --> 01:40:18.634]  And you look at Biden unable to talk, and Big Mike unable to talk, and all of it.
[01:40:18.654 --> 01:40:19.715]  You go, what's wrong with them?
[01:40:20.015 --> 01:40:21.215]  Why do they suck so bad?
[01:40:21.435 --> 01:40:25.477]  Because they don't want to feed you real intellectual, interesting oratory.
[01:40:26.137 --> 01:40:27.818]  They don't want you to have a pro-human idea.
[01:40:27.878 --> 01:40:34.401]  They want you to sign on to something totally devoid of reality and empty as hell.
[01:40:36.186 --> 01:40:42.529]  Because if you eat that, it's just like eating some Monsanto McDonald's hamburger.
[01:40:44.530 --> 01:40:48.752]  It's gonna give you pancreatic cancer faster than you can say, kiss my ass.
[01:40:50.313 --> 01:40:51.994]  And this stuff gives you cancer of the soul.
[01:40:52.594 --> 01:40:53.414]  None of it's real.
[01:40:53.875 --> 01:40:54.935]  None of it's bonafide.
[01:40:55.335 --> 01:40:56.216]  None of it delivers.
[01:40:56.876 --> 01:40:59.617]  You read Plato's Republic, that's how the whole world works.
[01:40:59.878 --> 01:41:02.499]  Every bit of it makes sense, but from an evil perspective.
[01:41:03.493 --> 01:41:06.917]  You read Socrates, it all makes sense, even if you don't agree with it at all.
[01:41:08.039 --> 01:41:14.848]  You read Adolf Hitler or Xi Jinping, it looks like a bunch of donkey turds on the ground.
[01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:17.570]  Because it's crap.
[01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.910]  It's lies.
[01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:20.131]  It's garbage.
[01:41:20.531 --> 01:41:21.351]  It's not real.
[01:41:21.711 --> 01:41:22.492]  It's fraud.
[01:41:22.772 --> 01:41:23.552]  It's mental illness.
[01:41:23.872 --> 01:41:24.673]  It doesn't deliver.
[01:41:24.893 --> 01:41:26.113]  You read the Declaration of Independence?
[01:41:26.413 --> 01:41:26.834]  Eloquence.
[01:41:27.454 --> 01:41:28.354]  You read the Bill of Rights?
[01:41:28.654 --> 01:41:29.014]  Eloquence.
[01:41:29.235 --> 01:41:30.335]  You read our Founding Fathers?
[01:41:30.935 --> 01:41:31.375]  Eloquence.
[01:41:31.435 --> 01:41:33.396]  Because they respected you.
[01:41:33.877 --> 01:41:36.778]  They talked to you like a man or like a woman.
[01:41:37.782 --> 01:41:48.069]  And they expected by their knowledge to be so high to raise you up because they were so confident they were not scared to give you the fire of Prometheus!
[01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:50.931]  And I'm not scared either because I will rise with you!
[01:41:52.292 --> 01:41:55.114]  Scanning the scene of the city tonight.
[01:41:55.934 --> 01:41:58.436]  Looking for you to start up a fight.
[01:41:59.096 --> 01:42:01.378]  There's an evil feeling in our minds.
[01:42:02.859 --> 01:42:05.821]  So stop running away because you're the one we will find.
[01:42:07.927 --> 01:42:10.389]  Scanning the scene of the city tonight.
[01:42:10.909 --> 01:42:13.612]  Welcome to the Civil War.
[01:42:13.912 --> 01:42:14.853]  Ha ha ha!
[01:42:16.414 --> 01:42:17.935]  Hey, don't worry folks.
[01:42:17.955 --> 01:42:18.996]  They want a physical fight.
[01:42:19.036 --> 01:42:21.258]  They start one, we let them start it.
[01:42:21.278 --> 01:42:22.599]  It's like Bunker Hill.
[01:42:23.459 --> 01:42:25.041]  Not before they got shot at by the British.
[01:42:25.081 --> 01:42:35.129]  They said, listen, hold your fire, make them shoot first, but if they came for a war, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, they're gonna get one.
[01:42:39.124 --> 01:42:42.226]  Seek and search and destroy!
[01:42:42.246 --> 01:42:44.267]  All right, that's enough.
[01:42:46.968 --> 01:42:48.909]  Seek and destroy!
[01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:49.029]  Sorry.
[01:42:50.250 --> 01:42:53.331]  Some flashbacks, being about 10 years old, listening to that.
[01:42:53.351 --> 01:42:54.812]  That's some good stuff.
[01:42:55.513 --> 01:42:57.493]  Had to stay up till midnight to hear that when I was about 10.
[01:42:57.614 --> 01:43:00.375]  My parents would be asleep, go down, get the radio on.
[01:43:03.605 --> 01:43:04.205]  Put that on?
[01:43:05.847 --> 01:43:07.428]  Sorry, let's get serious.
[01:43:15.054 --> 01:43:28.506]  The fantastical nature of the cult-like brainwashing going on, the archetypally ridiculousness of it, is mind-blowing.
[01:43:29.707 --> 01:43:31.751]  I mean, to chronicle it is just dizzying.
[01:43:32.291 --> 01:43:40.165]  All of society being fed into the boa constrictor mouth, the maw, the gaping stink.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:50.146]  Total social credit scores, total tracking, none of it to do with safety, all of it in their own words for power and control.
[01:43:51.107 --> 01:43:54.170]  Day one, globalist businesses stay open, all years close.
[01:43:54.751 --> 01:44:04.199]  Just a savage siege, an absolutely barbarous guerrilla attack on all that is decent.
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:09.004]  Humanity should mobilize and say no to this from its very foundation.
[01:44:11.408 --> 01:44:17.975]  But look at these articles, and this is in the BBC, because I know you know InfoWars doesn't lie to you, at least consciously.
[01:44:17.995 --> 01:44:19.436]  We make mistakes sometimes, very rarely.
[01:44:20.017 --> 01:44:21.859]  God, I wish we were wrong about all of it, believe me.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:24.601]  Paul Joseph Watson did an article on this.
[01:44:24.641 --> 01:44:28.926]  They got signs up that say,
[01:44:30.692 --> 01:44:39.261]  Look away from people, and psychologists are coming out saying, okay, this is mind control, this is shaming, this is total 1984.
[01:44:40.462 --> 01:44:46.649]  You know the massacre of fraud, you know COVID's overblown fraud, you know they're lying about the death numbers, you know they said 25 times more would die.
[01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:48.070]  I mean, you know all that!
[01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:49.452]  I mean, you know it, but now!
[01:44:51.064 --> 01:44:56.046]  In the UK, in Airstrip 1 in 1984, look away when passing other people.
[01:44:56.086 --> 01:44:59.168]  It's always more, more, more, more.
[01:44:59.408 --> 01:45:01.069]  Now the mask has to be the proper mask.
[01:45:01.349 --> 01:45:02.870]  Now you can't leave your house with a mask.
[01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:04.951]  Now you're locked down for eight weeks in Australia.
[01:45:05.211 --> 01:45:05.851]  It's all a test.
[01:45:06.151 --> 01:45:09.493]  And now they're going to come and take your kids to make sure they're not sick.
[01:45:10.653 --> 01:45:12.434]  No, it's about kids being taken from adults.
[01:45:12.934 --> 01:45:16.356]  If you'll let them come take your children, you'll do anything.
[01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:24.189]  I could have done the whole four hours on that and taken calls the whole time.
[01:45:27.031 --> 01:45:29.433]  I'm in a good talk show that just wanted to not even have a producer.
[01:45:29.713 --> 01:45:35.657]  There's just one article, four hours, hundreds of calls, incredible information, what's happening to you and your town, how it's being implemented.
[01:45:35.817 --> 01:45:36.737]  This is already in the U.S.
[01:45:36.777 --> 01:45:37.098]  as well.
[01:45:37.358 --> 01:45:37.978]  It's all U.N.
[01:45:38.018 --> 01:45:38.278]  run.
[01:45:38.498 --> 01:45:39.399]  Comes down from the U.N.
[01:45:39.539 --> 01:45:39.899]  The U.N.
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:44.782]  takes the crap up on the top of the hill and it rolls down right into our mouth.
[01:45:46.544 --> 01:45:46.924]  Oh, here it is.
[01:45:48.274 --> 01:45:54.437]  Delta bans Navy SEAL credited with killing Bin Laden for posting picture of himself mask-free.
[01:45:54.758 --> 01:45:58.220]  He goes on to say it's mind control, it's a fraud, it's about... and they said he's banned.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:01.842]  American Airlines dropping service 15 cities.
[01:46:03.663 --> 01:46:07.024]  Chicago mayor bans protests but only on her own block.
[01:46:07.445 --> 01:46:08.645]  You cannot make it up.
[01:46:09.446 --> 01:46:10.326]  She is on TV.
[01:46:10.426 --> 01:46:11.287]  There's videos of this.
[01:46:12.469 --> 01:46:15.090]  Saying, I am important.
[01:46:15.110 --> 01:46:17.050]  She even said, I can get haircuts, you can't.
[01:46:17.410 --> 01:46:18.070]  She said, I'm the mayor.
[01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:20.470]  Imagine the soulless disrespect.
[01:46:20.911 --> 01:46:23.531]  I'm important, I get a haircut, you don't.
[01:46:24.011 --> 01:46:26.052]  And I can play the clip, I've already played it 10 times, I'm gonna play it again.
[01:46:27.552 --> 01:46:29.472]  I'm important, I get a haircut.
[01:46:29.552 --> 01:46:31.352]  If I catch you getting one, you're fired.
[01:46:31.573 --> 01:46:33.153]  What about everybody losing their job?
[01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:35.273]  Oh, she goes, go get the government program.
[01:46:35.633 --> 01:46:37.094]  All the regular folks can't get it.
[01:46:37.834 --> 01:46:39.014]  I have lawyers involved.
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:41.480]  And people are like, hey, you don't want to do this deal.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:42.701]  I said, just, just see if we can get it.
[01:46:43.621 --> 01:46:44.982]  I had lawyers and accountants involved.
[01:46:45.022 --> 01:46:46.002]  We couldn't get the bailout.
[01:46:50.944 --> 01:46:51.304]  No one did.
[01:46:51.784 --> 01:47:03.888]  Everybody I talked to that was a, that was an auto parts salesman or a mechanic or a farmer, uh, or a teacher that was, or, or, or mainly, um, the groups I was talking to was, uh, waitresses and people and bartenders.
[01:47:03.908 --> 01:47:04.208]  They just know.
[01:47:05.316 --> 01:47:06.796]  I went to a hotel, like how long have you been laid off?
[01:47:06.816 --> 01:47:07.336]  Oh, six weeks.
[01:47:07.596 --> 01:47:08.037]  Do you get money?
[01:47:08.097 --> 01:47:08.717]  No, there's no money.
[01:47:08.957 --> 01:47:10.397]  I tried to go on the computer, it would never load.
[01:47:10.417 --> 01:47:11.417]  Yeah, of course it would never load.
[01:47:11.437 --> 01:47:15.018]  Because you weren't given the right code as an insider to get the money.
[01:47:16.858 --> 01:47:19.759]  And it came out like select groups were given preferential treatment.
[01:47:20.179 --> 01:47:22.459]  Welcome to standing in line in Russia, man.
[01:47:22.779 --> 01:47:23.379]  It don't work.
[01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:29.761]  So the Chicago mayor bans protests at her block, but says Black Lives Matter is good.
[01:47:30.061 --> 01:47:31.541]  Can't make it up.
[01:47:36.195 --> 01:47:42.640]  JetBlue doubles down on kicking family off planes because two-year-old wasn't wearing a mask.
[01:47:44.021 --> 01:47:48.505]  Smothering your children, torturing them, training you to abuse your children to submit to the corporates.
[01:47:48.945 --> 01:47:49.506]  There's nothing.
[01:47:49.826 --> 01:47:59.934]  But again, Lightfoot says she has a right to make sure their house is secure, but you can't have police, you can't have guns, and you can't protest at her house, but you can protest anywhere else.
[01:48:01.936 --> 01:48:02.657]  And it goes on.
[01:48:05.649 --> 01:48:10.431]  Belgium doctors urge families to wear masks at home as Belgians tire of COVID rules.
[01:48:10.791 --> 01:48:14.632]  Every time you go, take it off, they go, oh, you gotta wear it when you have sex.
[01:48:15.033 --> 01:48:16.633]  Like, hey, I'm not gonna wear this going down the street.
[01:48:16.853 --> 01:48:17.854]  You need to wear it when you have sex.
[01:48:18.234 --> 01:48:21.055]  They just clamp down when you, that's psychology.
[01:48:21.095 --> 01:48:23.456]  When you say no, you expand.
[01:48:23.976 --> 01:48:26.197]  They contract down to nothing.
[01:48:27.037 --> 01:48:28.738]  It's like in a lawsuit, they go, we want $100 million.
[01:48:28.758 --> 01:48:30.178]  You don't have $5 billion.
[01:48:30.679 --> 01:48:32.939]  But they say that so a million doesn't sound so big.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.020]  Give us 100 million.
[01:48:35.185 --> 01:48:36.347]  And you're like, I don't even have a million.
[01:48:36.787 --> 01:48:38.069]  Okay, well, we'll take the million.
[01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:39.631]  I said I don't have a million.
[01:48:40.553 --> 01:48:41.634]  But see how the psychology works?
[01:48:42.035 --> 01:48:43.196]  Oh, I'm really sick of this.
[01:48:43.637 --> 01:48:44.798]  The scientists admit it's a hoax.
[01:48:45.179 --> 01:48:46.080]  I want this off of me.
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:48.524]  And they go, oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:48:48.544 --> 01:48:50.747]  We want everything.
[01:48:51.926 --> 01:48:53.087]  It's all psychology.
[01:48:53.107 --> 01:48:56.089]  You're like, well, how do we beat psychologists and psychiatrists in the media?
[01:48:56.309 --> 01:48:58.570]  You don't believe a damn word they say, that's how.
[01:48:58.871 --> 01:49:05.775]  And I even catch myself sometimes, like, yeah, Hannity's gonna get fired, he attacked the president, he's an enemy.
[01:49:06.816 --> 01:49:08.157]  And I go look it up, it's not even true.
[01:49:09.217 --> 01:49:11.218]  It's like, why did I even believe that from Brian Stelter?
[01:49:11.239 --> 01:49:13.060]  It's like, I know he's a liar.
[01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:17.563]  I don't wanna use a gross analogy, but let's say you had a donkey's ass.
[01:49:18.746 --> 01:49:20.727]  And they go, oh, cherry pie comes out of the back of this.
[01:49:20.767 --> 01:49:22.128]  You just keep seeing crap coming out of it.
[01:49:22.348 --> 01:49:24.029]  You wait for months for the cherry pie to come out.
[01:49:24.370 --> 01:49:25.991]  Cherry pie don't come out that ass.
[01:49:26.291 --> 01:49:28.072]  Key lime pie, none of it.
[01:49:29.213 --> 01:49:30.894]  It may look like chocolate pie, but it isn't.
[01:49:31.554 --> 01:49:33.435]  Stop expecting that out of CNN.
[01:49:33.675 --> 01:49:34.356]  It craps on you.
[01:49:38.328 --> 01:49:41.130]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:41.710]  We think.
[01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:42.611]  Just let me think.
[01:49:42.671 --> 01:49:47.854]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[01:49:47.874 --> 01:49:48.535]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[01:49:49.235 --> 01:49:49.876]  Damn it!
[01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:50.276]  Why?
[01:49:50.996 --> 01:49:57.040]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[01:49:57.601 --> 01:50:00.743]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[01:50:03.297 --> 01:50:08.340]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:09.321]  You designed it, sir.
[01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:10.321]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:50:10.341 --> 01:50:11.782]  You taught me every television in London!
[01:50:12.002 --> 01:50:15.484]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[01:50:15.905 --> 01:50:25.551]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[01:50:25.591 --> 01:50:25.751]  Cameras.
[01:50:25.791 --> 01:50:26.471]  We need cameras.
[01:50:26.731 --> 01:50:27.472]  How did this happen?
[01:50:28.192 --> 01:50:28.953]  Who's to blame?
[01:50:29.933 --> 01:50:32.574]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:50:32.594 --> 01:50:34.495]  They will be held accountable.
[01:50:34.515 --> 01:50:40.417]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:50:40.777 --> 01:50:41.637]  I know why you did it.
[01:50:41.657 --> 01:50:43.318]  I know why you did it.
[01:50:43.578 --> 01:50:45.818]  I know you were afraid.
[01:50:46.299 --> 01:50:48.359]  War, terror, disease.
[01:50:48.999 --> 01:50:50.360]  There were a myriad of problems.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.845]  Inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:50:55.426 --> 01:51:01.232]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.
[01:51:01.833 --> 01:51:07.980]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:51:14.711 --> 01:51:15.912]  There is a war.
[01:51:16.412 --> 01:51:17.412]  It's happening now.
[01:51:18.273 --> 01:51:20.094]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:51:20.654 --> 01:51:22.455]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:51:23.195 --> 01:51:24.676]  We are the Resistance.
[01:51:25.136 --> 01:51:26.797]  We are the Infowar.
[01:51:33.346 --> 01:51:39.730]  You are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.
[01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:44.193]  Does that sound like something you are behind?
[01:51:44.233 --> 01:51:48.877]  Well, I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?
[01:51:49.977 --> 01:51:57.062]  Marina Abramovic is a superstar with every weird, twisted Hollywood, D.C.
[01:51:57.102 --> 01:51:58.523]  or New York lowlife.
[01:51:59.904 --> 01:52:02.506]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, Nigeria.
[01:52:04.488 --> 01:52:07.170]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:17.217]  Maxwell participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting his sex trafficking ring, ensuring that approximately three girls a day were made available to him.
[01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.257]  Human smuggling.
[01:52:18.417 --> 01:52:20.118]  People think of that as an ancient art.
[01:52:20.319 --> 01:52:26.603]  There are more human smugglers right now, traffickers they call them, than at any time in the history of our world.
[01:52:26.963 --> 01:52:30.667]  Trump has signed executive orders to expand interdiction of human trafficking.
[01:52:30.827 --> 01:52:31.528]  It's exploded.
[01:52:31.968 --> 01:52:34.210]  He's got the Navy and the Army involved stopping it.
[01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:36.913]  And they're having huge busts of small children kidnapped.
[01:52:37.073 --> 01:52:41.277]  Operation Cross-Country led to the arrest of 120 human traffickers.
[01:52:41.458 --> 01:52:43.740]  One of the victims was just three months old.
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.340]  124 arrests.
[01:52:47.263 --> 01:52:50.906]  339 criminal arrests were made across the state.
[01:52:51.267 --> 01:52:54.429]  84 underage boys and girls forced into prostitution.
[01:52:54.449 --> 01:53:00.815]  Sarasota deputies have announced the arrest of 25 people accused of traveling to have sex with a child.
[01:53:00.875 --> 01:53:05.439]  Tonight, more than half a dozen accused child sexual predators are off the street.
[01:53:05.559 --> 01:53:09.062]  One trafficker was arrested after making a deal with an undercover agent.
[01:53:09.742 --> 01:53:13.603]  The sale of three-month-old girl and her five-year-old sister for sex.
[01:53:13.643 --> 01:53:16.083]  Human sex trafficking of juveniles.
[01:53:16.323 --> 01:53:24.445]  I am prepared to bring the full force and weight of our government that we can do in order to solve this horrific problem.
[01:53:24.845 --> 01:53:32.767]  The whole Clinton system is just littered with pedophiles and Tony Podesta running, you know, full-page articles about how he loves art of naked children.
[01:53:32.847 --> 01:53:34.267]  They're throwing it in our face.
[01:53:42.159 --> 01:53:44.701]  Well, Deanna Lorraine is here with us in studio.
[01:53:44.961 --> 01:53:48.383]  We'll do a little bit in the next hour, and then the great Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:53:48.503 --> 01:53:50.664]  Talk about somebody that's a trailblazer like David Icke.
[01:53:50.705 --> 01:53:52.746]  He's been around as long, longer than David Icke.
[01:53:52.766 --> 01:53:57.769]  Kind of that first wave of awakening, he's going to be hosting much of the fourth hour ahead of the war room.
[01:53:58.189 --> 01:54:06.495]  Well, Deanna, I had a lot of fun with you on Area Air State Covering Serious Issues and last night, going out to the lake and checking stuff out with the crew.
[01:54:06.515 --> 01:54:07.135]  Yeah.
[01:54:07.215 --> 01:54:08.036]  A beautiful sunset.
[01:54:08.536 --> 01:54:09.456]  Gorgeous sunset.
[01:54:09.757 --> 01:54:10.257]  Gorgeous.
[01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:11.517]  I love Austin.
[01:54:11.857 --> 01:54:14.378]  It's too bad what's happening right now with everything going on.
[01:54:14.498 --> 01:54:16.859]  It's just crazy that everything... You noticed there were no boats out there?
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:17.640]  Yes!
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:19.020]  And that's abnormal, right?
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:20.401]  I would imagine that's abnormal.
[01:54:20.781 --> 01:54:26.883]  But, you know, everything... What they have to do is systematically strip us from our joy with everything in life right now.
[01:54:27.104 --> 01:54:28.244]  And it's monotony.
[01:54:28.304 --> 01:54:28.904]  Have you noticed?
[01:54:29.244 --> 01:54:31.125]  Everything's the same food right now.
[01:54:31.265 --> 01:54:33.466]  Everything is the same kind of environment right now.
[01:54:33.746 --> 01:54:34.887]  You can't go to a bar.
[01:54:34.967 --> 01:54:35.887]  You can't go singing.
[01:54:35.907 --> 01:54:36.447]  It's all liberal.
[01:54:36.527 --> 01:54:37.968]  All the menus are smaller.
[01:54:38.148 --> 01:54:38.288]  Yes.
[01:54:38.328 --> 01:54:39.588]  And they're all in on it.
[01:54:39.628 --> 01:54:41.309]  They all admit it's about... Yeah.
[01:54:41.329 --> 01:54:43.630]  Well, yeah, they don't even have menus for most places, actually.
[01:54:43.650 --> 01:54:44.830]  You have to do it with your phone.
[01:54:44.850 --> 01:54:45.210]  Well, exactly.
[01:54:45.230 --> 01:54:46.031]  They're getting rid of paper.
[01:54:46.191 --> 01:54:46.431]  Yeah.
[01:54:46.451 --> 01:54:48.011]  Because they want to be able to alter things in real time.
[01:54:48.091 --> 01:54:48.351]  Right.
[01:54:48.531 --> 01:54:51.132]  And I notice here they're trying to get rid of cash.
[01:54:51.252 --> 01:54:52.413]  They're trying to get rid of coins.
[01:54:52.793 --> 01:54:53.853]  In Texas, it's big.
[01:54:54.173 --> 01:54:54.713]  Not so much here.
[01:54:54.753 --> 01:54:54.953]  Oh, yeah.
[01:54:54.993 --> 01:54:55.254]  Oh, yeah.
[01:54:55.274 --> 01:54:55.454]  The U.N.
[01:54:55.474 --> 01:54:56.614]  admits they want to get rid of cash.
[01:54:56.654 --> 01:54:57.454]  This is all a rollout.
[01:54:57.534 --> 01:54:59.395]  People always ask, why do you still print articles?
[01:54:59.955 --> 01:55:03.498]  Well, we used to because it took time to load an article when I was on it 27 years ago.
[01:55:04.119 --> 01:55:06.861]  But now, especially, they change them.
[01:55:07.061 --> 01:55:08.742]  So we actually print everything we look at.
[01:55:08.983 --> 01:55:09.183]  Right.
[01:55:09.363 --> 01:55:10.384]  And you have to see it.
[01:55:10.424 --> 01:55:14.387]  When you're doing the news, when you're doing a show, you kind of want to see everything laid out like this.
[01:55:14.707 --> 01:55:16.289]  But they're trying to get rid of paper, everything.
[01:55:16.909 --> 01:55:22.374]  And they're systematically stripping us from our joy because you can't, at this point in America, you can't really escape
[01:55:22.754 --> 01:55:30.098]  I went to Florida a couple weeks ago just to try to escape from the communist California gruesome new some conditions, which is just crazy.
[01:55:30.158 --> 01:55:31.278]  I mean, it's very oppressive.
[01:55:31.618 --> 01:55:34.520]  And then I go to Florida, but it's really the exact same thing.
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:36.581]  You know, they issue it a statewide 8 p.m.
[01:55:36.641 --> 01:55:38.742]  curfew or, you know, a couple areas.
[01:55:38.762 --> 01:55:40.002]  They say it's 8 p.m.
[01:55:40.042 --> 01:55:41.123]  curfew or 10 p.m.
[01:55:41.163 --> 01:55:41.543]  curfew.
[01:55:41.563 --> 01:55:43.164]  And it's the same thing.
[01:55:43.204 --> 01:55:45.885]  The social distancing signs are everywhere flashing.
[01:55:46.225 --> 01:55:48.526]  The mandatory masks are everywhere.
[01:55:48.947 --> 01:55:51.008]  You have to go and do the same thing.
[01:55:52.128 --> 01:55:57.197]  It's kind of entrapping you in this mental misery, don't you think?
[01:55:57.678 --> 01:55:58.439]  But it's everywhere.
[01:55:58.759 --> 01:56:05.050]  They want you to not escape, so even the strongest, most emotionally strong person really can't escape from this kind of torture.
[01:56:05.891 --> 01:56:06.611]  And they want you to be like that.
[01:56:06.631 --> 01:56:07.052]  They break it down.
[01:56:07.072 --> 01:56:07.972]  And then you get to see all the sheep.
[01:56:07.992 --> 01:56:10.053]  You get to see all the sheep who get off on it.
[01:56:10.433 --> 01:56:12.654]  This morning I got up at about 4 a.m.
[01:56:12.714 --> 01:56:14.915]  I went and at about 6.30 did a hike.
[01:56:15.635 --> 01:56:22.919]  And literally, the first few times it happened, although okay I'm being paranoid, these guys would be jogging on these paths that were like 15 feet wide, 10 feet wide.
[01:56:23.219 --> 01:56:25.220]  They'd jog towards me when they're wearing a mask.
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:26.641]  You're kind of aggressive.
[01:56:26.821 --> 01:56:27.121]  Right.
[01:56:27.141 --> 01:56:30.383]  Because they would like always adjust it when they ran by me.
[01:56:30.703 --> 01:56:33.325]  It's the same weird neurotic tics.
[01:56:33.725 --> 01:56:34.665]  Yes, exactly.
[01:56:34.726 --> 01:56:41.910]  They're turning them into these OCD super neurotic people that are becoming like our Nazis, right?
[01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:43.891]  They're the ones shaming us into submission.
[01:56:43.911 --> 01:56:47.493]  They're the ones trying to shame us and scream at us when we're not following the rules.
[01:56:47.813 --> 01:56:48.574]  Have you heard the new thing?
[01:56:48.614 --> 01:56:51.496]  In the UK they have signs up saying turn your head when you walk by someone.
[01:56:51.516 --> 01:56:52.696]  That is nuts.
[01:56:53.817 --> 01:56:57.999]  Psychologists and psychiatrists testing what mind control they can engage in.
[01:56:58.019 --> 01:56:58.939]  Right, right, exactly.
[01:56:59.039 --> 01:57:07.263]  And it's all conditioning because in, you know, six months earlier we never would have imagined we'd be in this situation where there's something, we never heard the term... Slow down there.
[01:57:07.383 --> 01:57:19.968]  Imagine a year ago if we told you colleges are saying you can't leave for the semester, we're tracking you by phone app, social distancing, Chinese social credit score, turn your head, there's always more.
[01:57:20.208 --> 01:57:20.388]  Right.
[01:57:20.408 --> 01:57:21.369]  There's always more.
[01:57:21.409 --> 01:57:21.929]  And that's the thing.
[01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:28.372]  You can never, you can never let them take an inch because once they let you take an inch, they're going to take 10 miles, run with it and run with it.
[01:57:28.432 --> 01:57:30.494]  We understand the slippery slope because it's true.
[01:57:30.514 --> 01:57:31.934]  Well, we've gone off it.
[01:57:32.054 --> 01:57:32.875]  We were off the slope.
[01:57:32.895 --> 01:57:33.895]  We're like falling now.
[01:57:33.915 --> 01:57:34.936]  We're off the cliff right now.
[01:57:35.256 --> 01:57:43.041]  But this is what they do, you know, they try to just siphon off our joy, siphon off our freedom more and more until there is nothing left.
[01:57:43.061 --> 01:57:44.162]  There's no joy, there's no love.
[01:57:44.482 --> 01:57:56.390]  But you know, up until about six months ago, before we heard of coronavirus, there were study after study that proved it was common knowledge that social isolation is, hey, shocker, it's a bad thing, right?
[01:57:56.470 --> 01:58:01.193]  Social isolation can create misery, can create suicidal tendencies, psychological distress.
[01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:02.674]  It's always been that case.
[01:58:02.714 --> 01:58:04.956]  Why do you think they put people in solitary confinement?
[01:58:05.436 --> 01:58:13.202]  Right, and now all of a sudden the coronavirus appears and now all of a sudden nobody talks about the fact that social isolation has been known to be a very negative thing for people.
[01:58:13.663 --> 01:58:22.029]  This is all mind control training to make sure you stay where you are, you follow the orders, and then now once you follow those orders, more orders, more orders.
[01:58:22.069 --> 01:58:22.890]  What's going to happen?
[01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:26.953]  Because I already have seen the text messages of the Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii.
[01:58:27.413 --> 01:58:30.516]  They plan next year to start no vaccine can't leave your house.
[01:58:31.036 --> 01:58:31.337]  That's...
[01:58:32.057 --> 01:58:35.125]  And Australia has already announced it, so it's not coming, it's here.
[01:58:35.466 --> 01:58:37.210]  What's the awakening going to look like there?
[01:58:38.297 --> 01:58:39.017]  The awakening?
[01:58:39.078 --> 01:58:39.478]  I don't know.
[01:58:39.538 --> 01:58:40.899]  I mean, people have to wake up.
[01:58:40.959 --> 01:58:45.962]  But that's why you and I, we sound the alarm every single day because there's just no, you can't be silent anymore.
[01:58:46.022 --> 01:58:46.942]  We cannot be silent.
[01:58:46.962 --> 01:58:49.024]  We have no room, no time to be silent.
[01:58:49.304 --> 01:58:50.264]  We have to fight this.
[01:58:50.665 --> 01:58:52.206]  And we're at the front lines of this war.
[01:58:52.366 --> 01:58:54.947]  And everyone's just kind of sitting back and letting this happen.
[01:58:55.388 --> 01:58:58.229]  But once they do this, they're not going to just suddenly roll back.
[01:58:58.269 --> 01:59:02.712]  They're not going to suddenly say, oh, we're going to stop reinforcing mandatory vaccines.
[01:59:03.012 --> 01:59:03.753]  I mean, it's coming.
[01:59:04.053 --> 01:59:11.055]  It's just like when they said, you know, we're going to start removing children from the home and putting them into quarantine who are testing positive.
[01:59:11.375 --> 01:59:11.936]  Oh, guess what?
[01:59:11.976 --> 01:59:17.597]  We realized that when you're in your home, you actually are more likely to catch coronavirus than when you're out in public.
[01:59:17.637 --> 01:59:18.498]  And now the U.N.
[01:59:18.538 --> 01:59:19.958]  has started in Australia.
[01:59:19.978 --> 01:59:20.918]  You're absolutely right.
[01:59:20.978 --> 01:59:21.318]  Exactly.
[01:59:21.398 --> 01:59:22.399]  Deanna Lorraine, stay with us.
[01:59:23.839 --> 01:59:27.760]  When I grow up, I want to free planet Earth from the Satanists.
[01:59:28.441 --> 01:59:29.681]  We now take you live.
[01:59:31.182 --> 01:59:32.402]  They're all Satanists.
[01:59:35.265 --> 01:59:36.626]  Deanna Lorraine, you're here.
[01:59:36.746 --> 01:59:38.506]  You wanted to get into something really important.
[01:59:38.526 --> 01:59:39.307]  You're absolutely right.
[01:59:39.947 --> 01:59:44.709]  The Fourth Industrial Revolution, Agenda 2030, all of this is their stated plan.
[01:59:44.729 --> 01:59:46.450]  What's crazy is it's all admitted.
[01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:47.310]  Lay it out for them.
[01:59:47.471 --> 01:59:48.231]  It's all right there.
[01:59:48.291 --> 01:59:55.094]  So, Agenda 2030 is just another term for the Fourth Industrial Revolution by the World Economic Forum.
[01:59:55.274 --> 02:00:04.517]  And if you go to the World Economic Forum's website right now, you can see them promoting what's called the Great Global Economic Reset and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[02:00:04.557 --> 02:00:06.058]  It's right there on the homepage.
[02:00:06.578 --> 02:00:11.320]  And the World Economic Forum is supposed to be a reputable global organization, right?
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:16.342]  Where we're supposed to entrust with our economic concepts and themes.
[02:00:16.382 --> 02:00:19.123]  The AI will run everything.
[02:00:19.143 --> 02:00:20.243]  It's nonpartisan.
[02:00:20.563 --> 02:00:25.186]  And they're talking about, okay, we're going to replace human workers with AI and robots.
[02:00:25.266 --> 02:00:26.247]  Boom, it's right there.
[02:00:26.327 --> 02:00:29.189]  Talks about we're going to have a digital currency.
[02:00:29.269 --> 02:00:31.431]  And they say, well, then phase out humans.
[02:00:31.731 --> 02:00:31.971]  Exactly.
[02:00:32.011 --> 02:00:33.732]  It's like, oh, you're phasing me out of that?
[02:00:33.792 --> 02:00:34.533]  Cool!
[02:00:35.313 --> 02:00:38.195]  But they couch it in this propaganda and this fluffy language.
[02:00:38.436 --> 02:00:40.377]  We're like, oh, we're going to replace you with AI.
[02:00:40.697 --> 02:00:43.439]  And we're going to put a chip inside you that's going to vaccinate you.
[02:00:43.719 --> 02:00:44.940]  And that's going to have birth control.
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:49.243]  That's going to be, you know, charged by a remote control that someone else, I guess, Bill Gates.
[02:00:49.263 --> 02:00:50.224]  And then we talk about it.
[02:00:50.384 --> 02:00:51.945]  Because all that doesn't exist when it does.
[02:00:52.045 --> 02:00:53.525]  It's right there, exactly.
[02:00:53.545 --> 02:00:57.947]  I mean, if they trust Planned Parenthood, then they should, they obviously trust World Economic Forum.
[02:00:58.207 --> 02:00:58.947]  But it's right there.
[02:00:58.967 --> 02:01:01.928]  And the problem that I have with these sheeple is that they're so dumb.
[02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:05.510]  And look, even Republicans, there's a lot of Republicans that don't really know this stuff.
[02:01:05.570 --> 02:01:10.332]  As much as I try to sound the alarm and I'm like, I feel like I'm screaming underwater to deaf people.
[02:01:10.752 --> 02:01:15.654]  But it's like as much as you shout out, a lot of people just still think it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:01:15.674 --> 02:01:16.494]  But that's the key.
[02:01:16.594 --> 02:01:18.895]  If people just go look it up and see it's real.
[02:01:19.195 --> 02:01:19.435]  Yeah.
[02:01:19.615 --> 02:01:20.997]  As they're doing right now on TV.
[02:01:21.017 --> 02:01:25.722]  Because we can show when they push it as good, we say no, they say it doesn't exist.
[02:01:25.782 --> 02:01:26.703]  It's a game they play.
[02:01:26.923 --> 02:01:27.243]  It's a game.
[02:01:27.263 --> 02:01:30.807]  As long as you bypass that, what they actually said, people will reject this.
[02:01:30.867 --> 02:01:32.008]  Yes, they will.
[02:01:32.088 --> 02:01:32.529]  Exactly.
[02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:33.650]  And they're so good at it.
[02:01:33.670 --> 02:01:35.171]  They've been doing it for decades now.
[02:01:35.211 --> 02:01:40.517]  They've been training us to think of things as conspiracy theories that are so wacky like this.
[02:01:40.617 --> 02:01:42.339]  And because they make movies about it,
[02:01:42.739 --> 02:01:44.840]  They see that that desensitizes us to it.
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.842]  So we're like, oh, that's just a sci-fi movie.
[02:01:47.062 --> 02:01:48.082]  You know, that's crazy.
[02:01:48.363 --> 02:01:50.824]  But they're rolling this out right now, step by step.
[02:01:50.844 --> 02:01:53.306]  And in fact, they're escalating the plan.
[02:01:53.386 --> 02:01:57.628]  COVID has escalated the plans, escalated 2030 by a couple of years.
[02:01:57.668 --> 02:02:00.310]  It's a force jumping of the train onto their tracks.
[02:02:00.450 --> 02:02:00.950]  Exactly.
[02:02:01.130 --> 02:02:04.571]  And, you know, they're getting us used to living in these, like, smaller communities and everything.
[02:02:05.011 --> 02:02:11.752]  Even notice that a couple months ago, they're trying harder and harder to tie COVID into sustainable development goals and climate change.
[02:02:11.792 --> 02:02:13.292]  And they say it's good for the Earth.
[02:02:13.752 --> 02:02:15.933]  Actually, COVID's helping lower carbon right now.
[02:02:17.373 --> 02:02:18.093]  And you see it.
[02:02:18.233 --> 02:02:19.613]  You see these articles coming out.
[02:02:19.654 --> 02:02:20.534]  And they're so ridiculous.
[02:02:20.634 --> 02:02:23.174]  I have to laugh at them as saying... Well, they sound like Hitler wrote them.
[02:02:23.514 --> 02:02:26.735]  Because if you know the goal, I mean, this is what Nazis dream of.
[02:02:26.775 --> 02:02:27.255]  This is like...
[02:02:28.075 --> 02:02:35.342]  And they say, the desperation of their ability to tie it in, they say, oh, because of COVID, you should no longer eat meat.
[02:02:35.622 --> 02:02:36.883]  You know, we should all be vegans.
[02:02:37.023 --> 02:02:37.504]  Like, what?
[02:02:37.684 --> 02:02:38.845]  How does that tie into COVID?
[02:02:39.145 --> 02:02:45.531]  Because of COVID, you should consume less, and somehow you should be eating less, and you should be pushed into smaller cities.
[02:02:45.811 --> 02:02:51.853]  Well, they don't want you eating meat because it's been proven that it makes your brain more healthy, higher IQ.
[02:02:52.293 --> 02:02:56.495]  I mean, that's why Homo sapiens got so powerful is the eating meat.
[02:02:56.895 --> 02:02:57.715]  Sure, is it cruel?
[02:02:57.795 --> 02:02:58.735]  Is some of it done wrong?
[02:02:58.755 --> 02:03:00.016]  I feel sorry for the animals.
[02:03:00.076 --> 02:03:00.456]  Sorry!
[02:03:00.496 --> 02:03:01.016]  Yeah, sorry.
[02:03:01.076 --> 02:03:02.677]  We are a alpha predator.
[02:03:03.097 --> 02:03:05.658]  You take meat away, we're little gibbering idiots.
[02:03:07.319 --> 02:03:08.139]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:15.425]  And if you watch this Industrial Revolution show, like go to YouTube and you say, you know, what is the Fourth Industrial Revolution by the World Economic Forum?
[02:03:15.765 --> 02:03:21.529]  It's a creepy ten minute video that literally says that, you know, we're... Well, here's the thing.
[02:03:21.649 --> 02:03:25.752]  You get to that, but like most apes have very low... I'm not saying we're apes, but the things we're...
[02:03:26.809 --> 02:03:27.709]  They have very low IQs.
[02:03:27.769 --> 02:03:30.891]  It's the ones that eat meat that suddenly grow huge craniums and get smart.
[02:03:31.111 --> 02:03:31.591]  Right.
[02:03:31.651 --> 02:03:33.112]  The meat is the fuels.
[02:03:33.392 --> 02:03:34.953]  Fish oil is even better than meat.
[02:03:35.313 --> 02:03:35.593]  Yeah.
[02:03:35.633 --> 02:03:37.874]  So we could like literally cut out meat and just eat fish oil.
[02:03:37.894 --> 02:03:38.574]  We'd be even smarter.
[02:03:38.854 --> 02:03:41.435]  And then you have the fluoride, you know, covering the pineal gland.
[02:03:41.475 --> 02:03:41.836]  Exactly.
[02:03:41.876 --> 02:03:42.176]  Keep going.
[02:03:42.196 --> 02:03:42.676]  I'm interrupting.
[02:03:42.816 --> 02:03:48.759]  Yeah, yeah, no, and then so, so it says, we're trying to blur the lines between human and machine.
[02:03:49.099 --> 02:03:54.801]  We want to put so much technology in you that you don't know that- And the machines have rights that the guild gives it.
[02:03:55.041 --> 02:03:55.361]  Exactly.
[02:03:55.381 --> 02:03:56.142]  Then you're outvoted.
[02:03:56.222 --> 02:03:57.162]  Then you're owned, right?
[02:03:57.202 --> 02:03:57.983]  You're owned by something.
[02:03:58.243 --> 02:04:03.185]  And they also say in this creepy fourth industrial revolution, so they want to blur the lines between human and technology.
[02:04:03.505 --> 02:04:05.366]  They want to- Noah, you're on fire.
[02:04:05.386 --> 02:04:06.946]  For the next two segments, I'm going to shut up.
[02:04:07.306 --> 02:04:08.387]  Start over with your whole thing.
[02:04:09.408 --> 02:04:17.093]  Okay, they want to change the concept of what it means to be a human being.
[02:04:17.513 --> 02:04:20.395]  What it means to be a human being is going to be changed by who?
[02:04:20.735 --> 02:04:23.597]  By Bill Gates and these vaccines and these elites, right?
[02:04:23.637 --> 02:04:30.702]  They're going to tell us what it means to be a human being, and they're going to make us so high-tech that we're not going to know the difference between human and machine.
[02:04:31.142 --> 02:04:35.405]  Then what they're telling us is because it's so scary to have free thoughts right now,
[02:04:35.785 --> 02:04:38.148]  Because it's not very safe to have three free thoughts.
[02:04:38.448 --> 02:04:47.458]  They're going to hijack our brain, hijack our free thoughts, and then give us a safe space via some sort of a digital, something they put in us, a digital chip.
[02:04:47.838 --> 02:04:52.964]  And they're going to tell us and create this safe space for us so that we can think creative thoughts and diverge.
[02:04:52.984 --> 02:04:55.927]  They're going to give us the fake interface in front of our consciousness.
[02:04:56.067 --> 02:04:56.587]  Exactly!
[02:04:56.647 --> 02:05:01.211]  And people are so dumb, just like a Brave New World, they're going to say, oh wow, we have free speech!
[02:05:01.551 --> 02:05:05.454]  They're giving us the free speech, they're giving us the safe space, meanwhile they're monitoring everything.
[02:05:06.095 --> 02:05:15.021]  They're also, a lot of this contact tracing is thought policing, and it's like what they're trying to do is do the minority report crime prediction as well.
[02:05:15.302 --> 02:05:24.629]  So they're going to take our DNA, this is why I refuse to get tested, even if I'm on my deathbed, they're going to take that DNA and they're going to do something nefarious with all the contact tracing.
[02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:42.055]  And they even said, again, they say this stuff, it's not conspiracy, they say it, they say if we now have the right to, because you've been tested, because you are in the system, we have the right to remove you or your children from your home if you have, if you start coughing, if we notice that you have any kind of symptoms whatsoever.
[02:05:42.555 --> 02:05:48.099]  I mean, if that's not literally like child trafficking, like legalized kidnapping, I don't know what is.
[02:05:48.419 --> 02:05:51.662]  But people are so shallow they refuse to actually see it.
[02:05:51.722 --> 02:05:56.145]  You know, you see like the Prime Minister of Ireland saying that we have people in Ventura.
[02:05:56.205 --> 02:05:57.406]  I mean, this is happening in the U.S.
[02:05:57.446 --> 02:05:59.908]  This isn't anything, you know, just international anymore.
[02:06:00.268 --> 02:06:03.090]  So this is what's crazy, but this is not in the near future.
[02:06:03.130 --> 02:06:04.491]  It's happening right now.
[02:06:04.931 --> 02:06:05.392]  Right, Alex?
[02:06:06.192 --> 02:06:12.661]  And notice massive censorship has come in right at the same time to suppress it all, including medical doctors being censored.
[02:06:12.701 --> 02:06:14.123]  I mean, this is, we're here.
[02:06:14.143 --> 02:06:15.505]  We're not going into Orwellville.
[02:06:15.545 --> 02:06:15.886]  It's here.
[02:06:16.066 --> 02:06:17.428]  It's all about global tyranny.
[02:06:17.568 --> 02:06:19.130]  It's all about global tyranny.
[02:06:19.311 --> 02:06:22.155]  I smelled it from the first time that they announced coronavirus.
[02:06:22.515 --> 02:06:23.835]  And I knew Trump knew it too.
[02:06:23.976 --> 02:06:25.736]  I know Trump knows this too.
[02:06:25.996 --> 02:06:28.337]  And I think he's waiting to expose it all at the right time.
[02:06:28.817 --> 02:06:33.058]  But I worry that it's going to be too late because these systems will already be in place.
[02:06:33.359 --> 02:06:38.760]  And then we got Bill Gates saying he's going to re-imagine the school system.
[02:06:39.241 --> 02:06:44.242]  That's like putting Jeffrey Epstein in charge of re-imagining the adoption system.
[02:06:44.542 --> 02:06:45.663]  It doesn't work that way.
[02:06:46.123 --> 02:06:48.544]  And people just give their power right to these elites.
[02:06:48.624 --> 02:06:48.804]  It's nuts.
[02:06:50.304 --> 02:06:55.225]  And he always said, it's not that we support the unions or the teachers or any of that.
[02:06:55.605 --> 02:06:56.185]  They're corrupt.
[02:06:56.486 --> 02:06:57.146]  They're the chumps.
[02:06:57.186 --> 02:06:58.706]  They already got to sell out education.
[02:06:58.746 --> 02:06:59.966]  So we would not accept it.
[02:07:00.346 --> 02:07:01.047]  So we wouldn't want it.
[02:07:01.567 --> 02:07:02.547]  So they've already destroyed it.
[02:07:02.767 --> 02:07:05.308]  And then Bill Gates says, I want virtual learning 10 years ago.
[02:07:05.768 --> 02:07:06.488]  I've got a plan.
[02:07:06.708 --> 02:07:11.649]  And now here comes COVID and they're all acquiescing to it and now paying him and Google for it.
[02:07:11.829 --> 02:07:11.989]  Right.
[02:07:12.130 --> 02:07:15.275]  And they, you know, they act, people act like these plans were just rolled out.
[02:07:15.395 --> 02:07:17.199]  Oh, we just created this plan over the weekend.
[02:07:17.219 --> 02:07:17.700]  Oh my God.
[02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:18.601]  Just because of COVID.
[02:07:18.882 --> 02:07:20.725]  No, these plans have been in place for decades.
[02:07:20.985 --> 02:07:21.947]  That's all I can say.
[02:07:22.007 --> 02:07:24.512]  Eight months ago, they're going to have the vaccine by the fall.
[02:07:24.532 --> 02:07:24.973]  And now they do.
[02:07:25.475 --> 02:07:26.235]  Yeah, of course.
[02:07:26.855 --> 02:07:28.196]  Oh, three years is going to be three years.
[02:07:28.236 --> 02:07:30.336]  No, I knew from the beginning it wasn't going to be three years.
[02:07:30.396 --> 02:07:30.876]  Come on now.
[02:07:30.916 --> 02:07:32.396]  It's going to be, you know, a couple months.
[02:07:32.456 --> 02:07:34.277]  Fauci, they all had this rolled out.
[02:07:34.657 --> 02:07:35.597]  And people are so dumb.
[02:07:35.617 --> 02:07:38.137]  And they're going to be lining up to get this silly vaccine.
[02:07:38.598 --> 02:07:39.258]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:07:39.278 --> 02:07:42.158]  I don't even know if I would want to talk to friends anymore if they literally got it.
[02:07:42.178 --> 02:07:44.179]  Well, then they admit, oh, by the way, it doesn't protect you.
[02:07:44.199 --> 02:07:45.599]  So there'll be experiments.
[02:07:45.899 --> 02:07:47.939]  We're going to take up to five a year to see what works.
[02:07:47.999 --> 02:07:48.239]  Yes.
[02:07:48.419 --> 02:07:49.520]  Like, oh, I'm a guinea pig.
[02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:50.700]  Save me from COVID.
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:55.662]  That kills 25 times less than what they said with the fraudulent numbers.
[02:07:56.002 --> 02:07:56.222]  Right.
[02:07:56.342 --> 02:08:00.303]  And they even say that once we get a vaccine, guess what all the articles are saying now?
[02:08:00.583 --> 02:08:02.784]  You're still going to have to wear a mask and social distancing.
[02:08:03.064 --> 02:08:04.785]  Oh, don't you think that you're going to get back to normal?
[02:08:04.805 --> 02:08:04.965]  No, no, no.
[02:08:04.985 --> 02:08:06.086]  They never give up.
[02:08:06.386 --> 02:08:07.146]  This is their move.
[02:08:07.646 --> 02:08:09.847]  They're never going to give up the power they've grabbed.
[02:08:10.267 --> 02:08:11.788]  Everyone's thinking, I'm a hero.
[02:08:11.848 --> 02:08:12.528]  I'm wearing a mask.
[02:08:12.568 --> 02:08:14.049]  You have greased your own.
[02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:17.230]  I mean, they admit the economy is already irrevocably destroyed.
[02:08:17.610 --> 02:08:18.850]  All the blue cities have fallen.
[02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:19.951]  You go, oh, they're idiots.
[02:08:20.031 --> 02:08:20.211]  No!
[02:08:20.831 --> 02:08:24.353]  They're imploding the refugees into the other areas to implode that.
[02:08:24.573 --> 02:08:24.993]  Exactly.
[02:08:25.013 --> 02:08:27.474]  To then dictate the capitulation.
[02:08:27.714 --> 02:08:36.479]  And when you see, when you see the DNC this week, it's so creepy and dystopian, you know, it's depressing to watch these- Because these are the slaves of this anti-human spirit.
[02:08:36.499 --> 02:08:36.739]  Yeah.
[02:08:36.819 --> 02:08:38.099]  We go, it's easy to beat them.
[02:08:38.159 --> 02:08:38.439]  No.
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:40.721]  That, the enemy has those people.
[02:08:40.801 --> 02:08:41.041]  Right.
[02:08:41.241 --> 02:08:42.902]  You're like, you're like, oh look, they're weak.
[02:08:42.982 --> 02:08:43.962]  And you think, I can beat them.
[02:08:44.002 --> 02:08:44.322]  No.
[02:08:45.423 --> 02:08:46.963]  No, that's a zombie force.
[02:08:47.304 --> 02:08:48.484]  That's not a sign of weakness.
[02:08:48.704 --> 02:08:49.925]  That's a sign of power.
[02:08:50.405 --> 02:08:50.926]  It is!
[02:08:51.086 --> 02:08:58.551]  And you look at all these Zoom digital people superimposed to these rallies last night, quote-unquote rallies, and these sports stadiums.
[02:08:58.571 --> 02:08:59.812]  Turns out that's fake too.
[02:08:59.872 --> 02:09:03.474]  It's the future that they're telling us.
[02:09:03.494 --> 02:09:05.436]  Because they're afraid to bring real crowds in.
[02:09:05.456 --> 02:09:07.637]  Because we're going to say, Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[02:09:08.038 --> 02:09:08.778]  Arrest Fauci!
[02:09:08.858 --> 02:09:09.499]  Arrest Gates!
[02:09:09.799 --> 02:09:10.860]  They know their own people.
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:12.681]  Listen, on the Austin Police Department.
[02:09:14.165 --> 02:09:17.308]  And all the other... We all know what's going on because they're humans.
[02:09:17.348 --> 02:09:18.128]  They're against it.
[02:09:18.368 --> 02:09:19.149]  They gave us all the intel.
[02:09:19.169 --> 02:09:19.669]  They know we're real.
[02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:20.210]  That's right.
[02:09:20.230 --> 02:09:27.315]  That's why they have to do this and cut everybody off because they know there's a human rebellion against this un-human whatever-it-is.
[02:09:27.775 --> 02:09:28.396]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:28.476 --> 02:09:29.137]  Cyborgs.
[02:09:30.478 --> 02:09:36.042]  Deanna Lorraine is on fire and all our guests are on fire, but she's really on fire and she's staying an extra day in Austin.
[02:09:36.482 --> 02:09:39.805]  She'll be out there tomorrow, 12 noon, Barton Springs.
[02:09:41.769 --> 02:09:43.852]  The one downtown, so there's not a long hike down there.
[02:09:43.932 --> 02:09:46.895]  They've declared a citywide emergency, secretly, we've confirmed.
[02:09:47.436 --> 02:09:50.260]  Trying to stop us swimming in the free part of Barton Springs.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:55.867]  So we'll be just south of the paid part of Barton Springs, by the monkey tree, as it's called, tomorrow at noon.
[02:09:56.267 --> 02:09:56.848]  We'll see you there.
[02:09:56.868 --> 02:09:57.949]  But look at these headlines breaking.
[02:09:58.610 --> 02:10:01.912]  Hashtag Netflix pedophilia trends on social media.
[02:10:02.412 --> 02:10:06.774]  Frontline doctors silenced by YouTube and Facebook speaks out on a drowsy chloroquine.
[02:10:07.335 --> 02:10:09.816]  That's all up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:10:09.856 --> 02:10:13.758]  But you, you're knocking out of the park during the breaks about this moment we're at.
[02:10:14.118 --> 02:10:15.859]  They say it's the permanent new thing.
[02:10:15.979 --> 02:10:20.442]  Masks, forced inoculations, contact tracing, social distancing.
[02:10:21.102 --> 02:10:24.584]  Apps tracking us, the Chinese social score, this is their revolution.
[02:10:24.904 --> 02:10:27.065]  They knew we were awake, they were going to launch it later.
[02:10:27.406 --> 02:10:29.307]  We woke up, said no, they launched it early.
[02:10:29.327 --> 02:10:31.107]  I think it's going to go down in flames.
[02:10:31.508 --> 02:10:32.108]  Oh yeah, it is.
[02:10:32.148 --> 02:10:35.630]  And everyone says this is all going to, don't worry, it's just going to disappear by the election.
[02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:37.671]  No, it's not going to just disappear by the election.
[02:10:37.731 --> 02:10:39.351]  That's why Biden said three months at least.
[02:10:39.411 --> 02:10:41.332]  No, their own plan says it never ends.
[02:10:41.392 --> 02:10:41.612]  Yeah.
[02:10:41.932 --> 02:10:42.612]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:42.652 --> 02:10:43.332]  It never ends.
[02:10:43.652 --> 02:10:45.633]  And I think it's just going to get worse after the election.
[02:10:45.653 --> 02:10:49.234]  And even Biden says, if you elect me, it's going to be mandatory masks.
[02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:50.814]  That's the future you can look forward to.
[02:10:51.394 --> 02:10:57.695]  And when we see, you know, what's happening with the DNC, it's all Zoom digitally imposed people.
[02:10:58.195 --> 02:10:58.435]  Right.
[02:10:58.536 --> 02:10:59.976]  And we have these fake people.
[02:11:00.016 --> 02:11:00.616]  They duplicate them.
[02:11:00.776 --> 02:11:01.717]  Well, and duplicate them.
[02:11:02.077 --> 02:11:09.802]  That's the future that they're telling us we can look forward to, is a future where we only see friends and family over Zoom, over Skype.
[02:11:10.023 --> 02:11:11.564]  You know, where we only go to church.
[02:11:11.624 --> 02:11:13.965]  And in the future, AI can impersonate them.
[02:11:14.286 --> 02:11:15.907]  Exactly, which is even scarier.
[02:11:15.927 --> 02:11:18.509]  I don't know about you, Alex, but I don't want a future like that.
[02:11:18.569 --> 02:11:23.392]  I don't want a future where I can only see friends and family, go to church, do my services over Skype.
[02:11:23.472 --> 02:11:27.335]  That's like a mental prison where you're stuck in the same... There's these billboards that say,
[02:11:29.176 --> 02:11:29.977]  Remote church.
[02:11:30.057 --> 02:11:30.657]  It's a thing.
[02:11:30.757 --> 02:11:31.278]  No, it's not.
[02:11:31.618 --> 02:11:32.199]  It's BS.
[02:11:32.259 --> 02:11:32.979]  It's called prison.
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:34.321]  Yeah, it is called prison.
[02:11:34.401 --> 02:11:42.187]  And every day when you're doing the same thing and you can't leave your home, and the only way you can get any kind of stimulus is over a computer, that's killing you.
[02:11:42.447 --> 02:11:44.689]  And also, what are they going to say?
[02:11:44.890 --> 02:11:48.833]  They know that their stimulus, their false stimulus, cannot compete with reality.
[02:11:49.073 --> 02:11:49.793]  Right, exactly.
[02:11:49.813 --> 02:11:51.334]  And so they want to force us onto that.
[02:11:51.514 --> 02:11:52.855]  Yeah, and I'm an extrovert.
[02:11:52.955 --> 02:11:53.895]  I think a lot of people are.
[02:11:53.995 --> 02:11:55.876]  So you actually need that stimulus.
[02:11:56.156 --> 02:11:57.557]  You need to go see friends and family.
[02:11:57.857 --> 02:12:01.119]  You need to be out in public and, you know, changing different environments.
[02:12:01.159 --> 02:12:03.080]  Maybe you want to go to a sports game.
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:04.741]  Maybe you want to go to a restaurant or a bar.
[02:12:05.081 --> 02:12:09.543]  But in the exact same environment, every single day that they're corralling us into, that's literally hell.
[02:12:09.923 --> 02:12:11.144]  And it's, and it's, and it's...
[02:12:11.664 --> 02:12:13.765]  It's all about a test of what can we make you do.
[02:12:14.005 --> 02:12:15.566]  And the left loves it.
[02:12:15.606 --> 02:12:16.346]  It's like cute.
[02:12:16.766 --> 02:12:17.427]  It's fun.
[02:12:17.607 --> 02:12:18.667]  No, they're schmucks.
[02:12:18.907 --> 02:12:21.889]  How do you tell a leftist, Bianna, that you're an idiot?
[02:12:21.989 --> 02:12:23.510]  I mean, you're buying into a fraud.
[02:12:23.610 --> 02:12:24.230]  I try to.
[02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:25.130]  This is what I say.
[02:12:25.170 --> 02:12:35.895]  I say, look, you know, the next time they're going to say, you know, you're going to have to hop on one foot while wearing a mask, while social distancing from your dog because of stopping the spread to COVID.
[02:12:36.095 --> 02:12:37.336]  And they're probably going to do it.
[02:12:37.636 --> 02:12:39.257]  Like, I wonder, do you have a line?
[02:12:39.437 --> 02:12:40.397]  I mean, where is your line?
[02:12:40.417 --> 02:12:41.078]  They don't have a line.
[02:12:41.718 --> 02:12:43.579]  This is the time where I'm going to draw my line.
[02:12:43.839 --> 02:12:46.400]  I don't think they have a line, and that's why we are the line.
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:47.701]  We Patriots are the line.
[02:12:47.721 --> 02:12:48.961]  Well, that's a great quote.
[02:12:48.981 --> 02:12:49.902]  We are the line.
[02:12:49.942 --> 02:12:50.542]  We are the line.
[02:12:50.562 --> 02:12:51.442]  You are the line.
[02:12:51.482 --> 02:12:52.343]  We are the line.
[02:12:52.363 --> 02:12:53.663]  They have no boundaries.
[02:12:53.763 --> 02:12:55.344]  Infowars, the line in the sand.
[02:12:55.444 --> 02:12:56.264]  Yes, yes.
[02:12:56.745 --> 02:12:57.825]  And the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:12:57.905 --> 02:13:00.166]  Well, I'm impressed.
[02:13:00.206 --> 02:13:04.648]  So, we're going to go to break to one more segment.
[02:13:05.148 --> 02:13:06.229]  I got a few clips I want to play.
[02:13:08.562 --> 02:13:11.264]  They had all this on the blueprint to control us.
[02:13:11.404 --> 02:13:12.584]  They never had the nerve to pull it.
[02:13:13.085 --> 02:13:15.867]  Is it our fault we pushed them into a corner?
[02:13:15.987 --> 02:13:18.989]  I don't think it's our fault.
[02:13:19.089 --> 02:13:23.071]  I think we never should have agreed with the original lockdowns back in March.
[02:13:23.151 --> 02:13:24.452]  I don't think we should have agreed with it.
[02:13:24.772 --> 02:13:26.614]  I don't think we should have agreed with the original masks.
[02:13:26.974 --> 02:13:29.916]  I think we should have at that point said, this is sketchy.
[02:13:30.316 --> 02:13:30.857]  No, I agree.
[02:13:30.897 --> 02:13:36.243]  We got, I got, one of the few things I got, because I was like, probably BS, but it's still super dangerous.
[02:13:37.144 --> 02:13:37.965]  Uh, really?
[02:13:38.065 --> 02:13:39.086]  See, I knew from the beginning.
[02:13:39.106 --> 02:13:39.387]  Well, no, no.
[02:13:39.427 --> 02:13:43.612]  And I said I didn't trust it, but I still was like, before the lockdown came, I was against it.
[02:13:44.072 --> 02:13:45.514]  But, but kind of early on, I wasn't sure.
[02:13:45.734 --> 02:13:47.975]  I think Patriots, I think we kind of failed that test.
[02:13:48.015 --> 02:13:49.956]  I hate to say it, I think we failed that test.
[02:13:50.376 --> 02:13:51.317]  And we were tested.
[02:13:51.337 --> 02:13:52.857]  Well, it's because we have a social contract.
[02:13:52.877 --> 02:13:53.758]  We want to care about people.
[02:13:53.778 --> 02:13:56.559]  Exactly, and that's the thing, you know, we were trusting.
[02:13:56.699 --> 02:13:57.979]  We were trusting of everything.
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:03.682]  And we said, you know what, okay, we'll do it this once, even though it's against our greater instinct, we're going to do it this once.
[02:14:04.102 --> 02:14:04.923]  I wore the noodles.
[02:14:05.843 --> 02:14:06.583]  Oh, the noodles.
[02:14:07.044 --> 02:14:09.605]  Yeah, so now they have cardboard cutouts, right?
[02:14:09.625 --> 02:14:13.867]  They have cardboard cutouts and blow-up dolls at restaurants and bars to fill in the empty seats.
[02:14:14.107 --> 02:14:14.527]  Come on!
[02:14:14.887 --> 02:14:17.209]  I don't want to look at a cardboard cutout when I'm out to dinner!
[02:14:17.469 --> 02:14:18.510]  The left is a cult.
[02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:20.051]  They're a disgusting cult of idiots.
[02:14:20.071 --> 02:14:21.212]  Disgusting cult of idiots.
[02:14:21.713 --> 02:14:23.154]  And we can talk about the show later if you want.
[02:14:23.214 --> 02:14:23.594]  Oh yeah.
[02:14:24.355 --> 02:14:28.218]  She is going to be co-hosting The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[02:14:28.238 --> 02:14:34.783]  And we're going to cover the highlights of last night's DNC that was beyond paint drying.
[02:14:35.684 --> 02:14:38.806]  Pocahontas, Biden, all of it.
[02:14:38.887 --> 02:14:39.527]  It's coming up.
[02:14:39.587 --> 02:14:40.288]  But tomorrow!
[02:14:41.550 --> 02:14:42.713]  She's going to be down there with us.
[02:14:43.135 --> 02:14:48.951]  Liana Lorraine, high noon, Barton Springs downtown, by the monkey tree on the south side.
[02:14:50.418 --> 02:14:51.198]  It was closed.
[02:14:51.238 --> 02:14:51.999]  It's open to the public.
[02:14:52.019 --> 02:14:54.139]  Now they're trying to close it again because we're coming.
[02:14:54.159 --> 02:14:55.660]  They're calling it a citywide emergency.
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:15:00.302]  Imagine the thought crime of people swimming in the natural springs there.
[02:15:00.662 --> 02:15:01.262]  It's beautiful.
[02:15:01.602 --> 02:15:02.703]  This is a big event now.
[02:15:03.163 --> 02:15:06.924]  Tell everybody you know it's a peaceful showdown against the control freaks.
[02:15:07.445 --> 02:15:09.205]  The Mind Controllers tomorrow.
[02:15:09.866 --> 02:15:11.746]  Swimming with Alex Jones 2.0.
[02:15:12.147 --> 02:15:13.207]  Barton Springs Edition.
[02:15:13.487 --> 02:15:15.708]  You might just get me to be in a bikini tomorrow.
[02:15:15.868 --> 02:15:17.869]  I haven't been in a bikini since, like, February.
[02:15:17.889 --> 02:15:19.049]  Oh, I'm definitely going.
[02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:22.990]  You know, I'm gay, but I still, you know, would like to see you in a bikini.
[02:15:23.070 --> 02:15:23.951]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:24.071 --> 02:15:27.512]  So, some people might... If I ran a death camp in China, I'd be okay, as long as I'm gay.
[02:15:28.172 --> 02:15:28.492]  You know what?
[02:15:28.552 --> 02:15:29.893]  It's okay, because Tim Cook's gay.
[02:15:31.033 --> 02:15:31.693]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:31.754 --> 02:15:32.434]  And Tim Cook's gay.
[02:15:32.454 --> 02:15:35.875]  I'll be screaming, we'll be screaming with our megaphones and everything.
[02:15:35.895 --> 02:15:39.036]  We'll call it a peaceful BLM protest just so that nobody shows up.
[02:15:39.056 --> 02:15:39.636]  Well, exactly.
[02:15:39.656 --> 02:15:42.037]  Tops, see me probably go BLM, extra burning stuff.
[02:15:42.097 --> 02:15:42.557]  I don't want to.
[02:15:42.657 --> 02:15:43.237]  Okay, great.
[02:15:43.317 --> 02:15:46.258]  Burn, like flamethrowers out, BLM.
[02:15:46.918 --> 02:15:47.899]  Burn a police car.
[02:15:48.359 --> 02:15:53.401]  See, I mean, I think Trump would be such a boss if he just threw a regular-sized rally as he normally does.
[02:15:53.421 --> 02:15:54.421]  And called it a BLM rally.
[02:15:55.562 --> 02:15:57.563]  And he says, hey, I actually think Black Lives Matter.
[02:15:57.643 --> 02:15:58.183]  Everybody does.
[02:15:58.543 --> 02:16:00.405]  Come to the event, they couldn't stop him.
[02:16:00.465 --> 02:16:03.366]  Oh my God, Trump should throw a Black Lives Matter.
[02:16:03.667 --> 02:16:04.327]  You're a genius.
[02:16:04.827 --> 02:16:06.328]  He should do that immediately.
[02:16:06.368 --> 02:16:07.429]  Yes, immediately.
[02:16:07.549 --> 02:16:09.050]  And they couldn't say anything.
[02:16:09.070 --> 02:16:14.654]  Because the media members said like, oh, Black Lives Matter lowered COVID, but Trump caused the nationwide deal.
[02:16:14.934 --> 02:16:20.297]  This is how he could tie in BLM with his rally and with COVID all in the same thing.
[02:16:20.337 --> 02:16:21.518]  What if I wear a bikini?
[02:16:21.798 --> 02:16:22.379]  I would love it!
[02:16:22.479 --> 02:16:23.501]  Why don't you wear a bikini?
[02:16:23.881 --> 02:16:25.303]  Why don't you wear a MAGA bikini?
[02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:27.547]  And we'll both, and we could do like, who wore it better?
[02:16:27.707 --> 02:16:29.089]  You know, we could make a con, we could do a quiz.
[02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:30.651]  Well obviously, I'm gonna wear it better.
[02:16:30.771 --> 02:16:32.494]  Obviously, you're gonna get more votes than me.
[02:16:32.514 --> 02:16:33.555]  Trump should wear a bikini.
[02:16:33.575 --> 02:16:35.518]  Oh my god, I need to lose weight and I gotta work out.
[02:16:35.658 --> 02:16:36.660]  What if Trump wore a bikini?
[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:37.660]  I would love that.
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:38.440]  I think he should.
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:41.681]  I think it should be me, you, and Trump on the catwalk.
[02:16:42.541 --> 02:16:43.701]  We'll see who wears it best.
[02:16:43.921 --> 02:16:44.521]  I don't know.
[02:16:44.601 --> 02:16:45.662]  I'm going to win that one.
[02:16:45.742 --> 02:16:46.442]  I haven't been to a gym.
[02:16:46.462 --> 02:16:47.602]  I predict I would win.
[02:16:47.942 --> 02:16:48.282]  Okay.
[02:16:48.602 --> 02:16:49.702]  I'll predict I'm going to win.
[02:16:50.422 --> 02:16:51.403]  Or maybe Trump is going to win.
[02:16:51.643 --> 02:16:52.463]  I think you would win.
[02:16:52.483 --> 02:16:54.103]  Because I haven't been to a gym in a year.
[02:16:54.123 --> 02:16:56.263]  I haven't gotten my nails done since February.
[02:16:56.403 --> 02:16:57.484]  Diana, that's not true.
[02:16:57.564 --> 02:16:59.764]  Obviously, you will win the bikini.
[02:16:59.864 --> 02:17:00.164]  No, no.
[02:17:00.504 --> 02:17:01.704]  I do wear a bikini regularly.
[02:17:01.744 --> 02:17:02.264]  It's not on there.
[02:17:02.344 --> 02:17:03.825]  If I don't win, I'm going to go jump off the cliff.
[02:17:03.845 --> 02:17:05.025]  I'm actually wearing a bikini right now.
[02:17:05.405 --> 02:17:06.166]  I noticed that.
[02:17:06.306 --> 02:17:09.668]  I thought I noticed that there was like an outline of a bikini, you know, under your suit.
[02:17:09.688 --> 02:17:12.130]  And I said, wow, that must be like his power suit that he does.
[02:17:12.170 --> 02:17:13.151]  He walks to work every day.
[02:17:13.171 --> 02:17:13.971]  Should I show everybody?
[02:17:14.131 --> 02:17:14.752]  I think you should.
[02:17:15.272 --> 02:17:16.073]  It's frisky.
[02:17:16.113 --> 02:17:16.393]  Fine.
[02:17:16.433 --> 02:17:17.734]  I don't normally take my own clothes off.
[02:17:17.754 --> 02:17:19.856]  It's fired up Fridays here.
[02:17:19.896 --> 02:17:20.776]  See the bikini line?
[02:17:20.916 --> 02:17:21.597]  Oh, wow.
[02:17:21.617 --> 02:17:22.998]  See that right there?
[02:17:23.018 --> 02:17:23.478]  Great.
[02:17:23.618 --> 02:17:24.199]  That's great.
[02:17:24.459 --> 02:17:24.939]  That's what it is.
[02:17:24.979 --> 02:17:25.379]  Look at this.
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:28.282]  I would do the same too, but I just waxed my chest, so.
[02:17:29.282 --> 02:17:30.163]  I wax mine too.
[02:17:30.503 --> 02:17:31.364]  That is great.
[02:17:31.524 --> 02:17:31.784]  See?
[02:17:31.824 --> 02:17:32.325]  Right there.
[02:17:32.385 --> 02:17:33.346]  That's going to make you win.
[02:17:33.366 --> 02:17:35.908]  And then I'm going to have to... You can see that I waxed it.
[02:17:35.928 --> 02:17:36.688]  See, there's no hair.
[02:17:37.149 --> 02:17:40.311]  That is definitely a frisky Friday type of thing to do today.
[02:17:40.391 --> 02:17:40.812]  That's right.
[02:17:40.832 --> 02:17:43.254]  Well, you can tell that there's... I waxed.
[02:17:43.274 --> 02:17:43.734]  There's no hair.
[02:17:43.754 --> 02:17:45.375]  Talk about gaslighting.
[02:17:45.435 --> 02:17:46.616]  It's totally hairy.
[02:17:46.656 --> 02:17:48.658]  No, but this is how we gaslight the public.
[02:17:48.678 --> 02:17:50.440]  See, if that were the... This is not hair.
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:51.661]  They would say... No hair.
[02:17:51.841 --> 02:17:52.741]  This is not hair.
[02:17:52.761 --> 02:17:53.602]  This is not hair.
[02:17:53.622 --> 02:17:54.223]  This is no hair.
[02:17:54.243 --> 02:17:55.904]  Biden does not have cognitive problems.
[02:17:56.084 --> 02:17:56.684]  Yeah.
[02:17:56.944 --> 02:17:58.084]  Antifa does not exist.
[02:17:58.164 --> 02:17:58.665]  It's a myth.
[02:17:59.125 --> 02:18:00.365]  I do not have hair on my chest.
[02:18:00.485 --> 02:18:02.025]  And Big Mike is a woman.
[02:18:02.265 --> 02:18:05.166]  Big Mike does not have a roll of silver dollars in her pants.
[02:18:05.246 --> 02:18:08.967]  And they say it enough times, and everyone believes it, just like the rules for wrestling.
[02:18:08.987 --> 02:18:10.027]  What is up with Big Mike?
[02:18:10.667 --> 02:18:24.270]  I think Big Mike, you know, I think, I don't know if it's just a prank on us, that like, or maybe it's sort of a weird fetish that he and Hussein play, where they're like, oh, you know, put a little snake in your pants, and it kind of turns me on, you know, every couple days.
[02:18:24.290 --> 02:18:25.570]  Well, by the way, look at that photo.
[02:18:25.970 --> 02:18:26.531]  I just look like a man.
[02:18:26.552 --> 02:18:27.093]  Put it back up there.
[02:18:27.394 --> 02:18:29.038]  That's a beautiful woman right there.
[02:18:29.258 --> 02:18:30.682]  That's a beautiful woman.
[02:18:30.702 --> 02:18:32.727]  That's the heavyweight champion of the world!
[02:18:32.747 --> 02:18:33.669]  That's a huge bitch.
[02:18:35.916 --> 02:18:36.876]  No, you know what?
[02:18:37.497 --> 02:18:40.578]  I don't know for sure, but there's... Look, look, even adjusted.
[02:18:40.598 --> 02:18:41.118]  Slow that down.
[02:18:41.138 --> 02:18:41.919]  I adjusted it.
[02:18:41.939 --> 02:18:42.379]  Now watch this.
[02:18:42.439 --> 02:18:44.460]  I mean, you're talking about... And Joan Ritter.
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:46.781]  Ain't wearing underwear, dangling around.
[02:18:46.881 --> 02:18:48.242]  That is a dangler right there.
[02:18:48.422 --> 02:18:50.203]  And you know what's an impressive... I'm not trying to be gross.
[02:18:50.223 --> 02:18:52.024]  I was about to say, like, that's eight inches flaccid.
[02:18:52.044 --> 02:18:53.184]  That's like a foot and a half long.
[02:18:53.304 --> 02:18:54.385]  Oh yeah, that's impressive.
[02:18:54.685 --> 02:18:56.266]  That's probably like a world record size.
[02:18:56.326 --> 02:18:57.306]  That's an anaconda.
[02:18:57.346 --> 02:19:00.768]  That's something that a lot of guys would be jealous of, I think.
[02:19:01.548 --> 02:19:03.511]  And then we have, you know, Joan Rivers.
[02:19:03.591 --> 02:19:07.195]  Just a few days later after that, what happened?
[02:19:07.535 --> 02:19:09.858]  Hey, maybe her name should be Anaconda Mike.
[02:19:10.158 --> 02:19:10.699]  I think so.
[02:19:10.819 --> 02:19:11.720]  I think Anaconda Mike.
[02:19:11.941 --> 02:19:13.322]  You know, let's change that name.
[02:19:13.342 --> 02:19:15.765]  I got censored on my nickname.
[02:19:15.785 --> 02:19:16.826]  It's like a rattlesnake.
[02:19:16.867 --> 02:19:18.068]  Let's see.
[02:19:18.488 --> 02:19:18.969]  You got it.
[02:19:19.069 --> 02:19:19.410]  You got.
[02:19:20.444 --> 02:19:20.864]  Oh my god.
[02:19:20.984 --> 02:19:21.385]  It's true.
[02:19:21.525 --> 02:19:22.445]  Anaconda Mike.
[02:19:22.706 --> 02:19:24.027]  Anaconda Mike!
[02:19:24.067 --> 02:19:24.907]  I think we're gonna do it.
[02:19:24.947 --> 02:19:25.247]  It's better.
[02:19:25.307 --> 02:19:27.049]  King Cobra Mike or... Alright.
[02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.929]  Stop it.
[02:19:27.969 --> 02:19:29.310]  This is not Family Show.
[02:19:29.410 --> 02:19:30.031]  It's Fired Up Mike!
[02:19:30.071 --> 02:19:30.992]  Stop it right now!
[02:19:31.252 --> 02:19:32.553]  It's Fiery Friday!
[02:19:32.593 --> 02:19:33.133]  Fiery Friday!
[02:19:33.153 --> 02:19:35.094]  You don't talk about Big Mike.
[02:19:35.255 --> 02:19:35.675]  Look at that.
[02:19:35.855 --> 02:19:36.335]  Look at that.
[02:19:36.375 --> 02:19:36.796]  That is good.
[02:19:36.816 --> 02:19:37.496]  The shoulders.
[02:19:37.997 --> 02:19:38.457]  The chin.
[02:19:39.157 --> 02:19:43.739]  I think they play dress-up, and Hussein throws on a wig, she puts a snake in the paint.
[02:19:43.759 --> 02:19:46.039]  Oh, you know, you know he's catching those pitches.
[02:19:46.159 --> 02:19:46.980]  Yeah, he's catching.
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:47.700]  He's catching.
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:48.340]  From Iron Mike.
[02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:49.841]  This is happening right now.
[02:19:50.041 --> 02:19:51.501]  And I think Bill Gates does too.
[02:19:51.541 --> 02:19:54.982]  You know, him in his pink sweaters, and his wife looks quite manly.
[02:19:55.002 --> 02:20:01.164]  I think there's something going on with the elite where they do this sort of sigh-off on us with the very people that they're married to.
[02:20:01.184 --> 02:20:02.305]  What do you think?
[02:20:02.365 --> 02:20:03.045]  Is that going too far?
[02:20:03.065 --> 02:20:06.626]  Word is, actually, that Bill Gates is actually a woman.
[02:20:07.222 --> 02:20:09.823]  Yeah, I think he's a pitcher or a catcher too.
[02:20:10.523 --> 02:20:13.844]  I don't know who he is, but he's certainly not who he presents himself to be.
[02:20:13.884 --> 02:20:16.325]  That's like saying that George Soros is a humanitarian.
[02:20:17.825 --> 02:20:21.307]  Can we play the clip of Joan Rivers talking about Iron Mike, Big Mike?
[02:20:21.407 --> 02:20:21.967]  Yes!
[02:20:22.107 --> 02:20:23.707]  Here, go ahead and get that clip ready.
[02:20:23.747 --> 02:20:28.309]  Here is Joan Rivers, right before she died, talking about Anaconda Mike.
[02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:28.809]  Here it is.
[02:20:32.608 --> 02:20:35.949]  You made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday.
[02:20:36.009 --> 02:20:38.790]  Is this like a new cottage career move for you?
[02:20:38.810 --> 02:20:39.850]  I am so excited.
[02:20:40.650 --> 02:20:42.431]  And I should do very well because I don't show it.
[02:20:42.571 --> 02:20:46.772]  And do you think the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president?
[02:20:46.792 --> 02:20:48.152]  We already have it with Obama.
[02:20:48.593 --> 02:20:50.433]  So let's just calm down.
[02:20:50.753 --> 02:20:55.254]  You know Michelle is a tramp.
[02:20:55.635 --> 02:20:56.475]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[02:21:09.947 --> 02:21:11.608]  I mean... It's okay!
[02:21:11.968 --> 02:21:13.009]  Who says that?
[02:21:13.069 --> 02:21:16.031]  She said it was so casual, like, it's just, oh yeah, it's just common knowledge.
[02:21:17.012 --> 02:21:17.572]  Everyone knows.
[02:21:17.592 --> 02:21:20.074]  Her, Lavonne Robinson, right?
[02:21:20.094 --> 02:21:20.735]  Isn't that the name?
[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:22.360]  Isn't that the real name?
[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:25.602]  Well, let's just say she's the Louisville Slugger of First Ladies.
[02:21:25.862 --> 02:21:26.442]  Oh, yeah.
[02:21:26.702 --> 02:21:27.783]  But guess what?
[02:21:27.823 --> 02:21:37.648]  The whole transgender agenda that they're pushing fast and furious... Yeah, why are they... I have an article where they're like, this child... This is an adult show, folks, but this is what kids are being taught.
[02:21:37.788 --> 02:21:38.008]  Right.
[02:21:38.108 --> 02:21:46.893]  This 8-year-old is a top, and then it shows... I mean, it's like, you know, the guy pitching, and then it shows the weird dude in clown makeup leading a kid into some sex dungeon.
[02:21:46.913 --> 02:21:47.293]  Oh, my God.
[02:21:47.313 --> 02:21:49.174]  I mean, this is open... They're out in the open.
[02:21:49.514 --> 02:21:53.715]  All right, and they, you know, they have, uh, for their reading, which, oh my god, that is disturbing.
[02:21:53.915 --> 02:21:54.236]  Wow.
[02:21:54.856 --> 02:22:04.179]  And their reading material for kindergartners is My Princess Boy, and, uh, and talking My Fair Lady, and, you know, sex is a funny word.
[02:22:04.199 --> 02:22:07.860]  Because they know men might stand up to what they're doing, but they're worried about men.
[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:15.290]  Exactly, and this is all the feminizing of men, the dehumanizing of people, attacking the family unit, just breaking up the family unit.
[02:22:15.631 --> 02:22:23.481]  And they want men to turn into women, because this is more of a problem, by the way, of men turning into women that's more prevalent on the man's side.
[02:22:24.062 --> 02:22:27.425]  And by the time a kid is 8 years old, all of a sudden they're questioning their identity.
[02:22:27.445 --> 02:22:28.786]  They're questioning their gender.
[02:22:29.087 --> 02:22:30.608]  This is not normal.
[02:22:30.808 --> 02:22:32.690]  They're even instructing kids... This is sexual abuse.
[02:22:32.730 --> 02:22:34.211]  This is perverts messing with your kids.
[02:22:34.291 --> 02:22:34.551]  It is.
[02:22:34.592 --> 02:22:38.755]  And they're instructing kids to play doctor on each other, you know, and sex ed class and everything.
[02:22:38.835 --> 02:22:39.276]  Come on!
[02:22:39.656 --> 02:22:41.797]  And it's like men in goblin outfits?
[02:22:41.877 --> 02:22:43.057]  Goblins, yes!
[02:22:43.157 --> 02:22:45.738]  Yeah, the drag queen story hour.
[02:22:45.938 --> 02:22:48.699]  But then again, at this point, Alex, I blame the parents.
[02:22:48.719 --> 02:22:55.681]  Because if you're a parent and you're not viciously overseeing what's being taught in the schools and what's being handed over to your kids... You're right.
[02:22:55.761 --> 02:22:59.482]  We have acquiesced to goblin creatures having access to our children.
[02:22:59.662 --> 02:23:06.424]  Goblins are sleeping with children at this point and they're reading story time to them and at this point the parents are complicit.
[02:23:06.724 --> 02:23:08.084]  It's time for parents to stand up.
[02:23:08.384 --> 02:23:10.105]  Why aren't parents mass protesting?
[02:23:10.365 --> 02:23:12.545]  Trump should come out against pedophile story time.
[02:23:12.665 --> 02:23:13.766]  He really should.
[02:23:13.866 --> 02:23:16.086]  I mean I think he maybe has a little bit but like this is creepy.
[02:23:16.286 --> 02:23:19.747]  Could you imagine putting your son or your three-year-old
[02:23:19.827 --> 02:23:20.007]  I don't
[02:23:35.797 --> 02:23:36.797]  There's glitter on it.
[02:23:36.857 --> 02:23:39.258]  Here in Austin, like, dudes are humping little girls.
[02:23:39.478 --> 02:23:40.078]  Oh, man.
[02:23:40.298 --> 02:23:41.918]  See, you know it, too.
[02:23:41.938 --> 02:23:44.719]  And then you look into their history, and it turns out they're like a four-time pedophile.
[02:23:44.739 --> 02:23:45.239]  Yeah, of course.
[02:23:45.259 --> 02:23:45.879]  A sex offender.
[02:23:46.159 --> 02:23:46.839]  Well, what are these people?
[02:23:46.879 --> 02:23:48.800]  And guess who sponsors the Drag Queen Story Hour?
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:50.000]  It's Michelle Obama.
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:53.121]  But look at that nice young lady there, leading the small child in.
[02:23:53.381 --> 02:23:57.182]  And they say in the video that they're leading that child to have sex with somebody.
[02:23:57.262 --> 02:24:02.063]  The agenda of sexualizing children is well underway, but... Burn in hell, Satanists!
[02:24:02.103 --> 02:24:02.763]  Burn in hell!
[02:24:04.662 --> 02:24:10.707]  Alright, it's my final prelude as I leave us, but I tell you that tomorrow...
[02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:17.905]  12 noon, Barton Springs, downtown, south side of it, the free side, will be there.
[02:24:17.965 --> 02:24:19.085]  It's called the Monkey Tree.
[02:24:19.105 --> 02:24:26.871]  And they've called a secret citywide emergency that we're trying to go down there unauthorized, even though we forced them to open the parks up.
[02:24:27.291 --> 02:24:30.254]  That's how dystopian and insane this has gotten.
[02:24:30.374 --> 02:24:35.618]  And yeah, I said, hey, thanks for coming down, everybody, last weekend at another area of the park that's harder to get to.
[02:24:35.638 --> 02:24:38.140]  This is very easy to assess and access.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:41.482]  I said, I'm gonna get you P. Terry's hamburgers.
[02:24:41.502 --> 02:24:42.243]  Well, they were scared.
[02:24:42.283 --> 02:24:43.364]  Somebody else is bringing food.
[02:24:43.784 --> 02:24:46.206]  I'm paying for 500 people to get a sandwich and a drink.
[02:24:46.466 --> 02:24:46.847]  Wow.
[02:24:46.987 --> 02:24:47.828]  And so, ah, whatever.
[02:24:47.868 --> 02:24:48.408]  It's all fun.
[02:24:48.808 --> 02:24:57.336]  And so, it's pissing in the face of the globalists and us eating food together, having a fun time in the spring water that comes out at 70 degrees right out of the rocks tomorrow.
[02:24:57.676 --> 02:24:58.477]  12 noon, you'll be there?
[02:24:58.717 --> 02:24:59.477]  I'll be there!
[02:24:59.678 --> 02:25:00.798]  I'll be there in my onesie.
[02:25:01.658 --> 02:25:02.018]  All right.
[02:25:02.058 --> 02:25:02.379]  Yes.
[02:25:02.459 --> 02:25:03.359]  I'll be in a onesie as well.
[02:25:03.439 --> 02:25:03.980]  Okay, great.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.341]  We'll have matching onesies, matching Info Wars onesies.
[02:25:06.361 --> 02:25:07.342]  I have a little onesie I wear.
[02:25:07.362 --> 02:25:08.663]  It's like a little caveman onesie.
[02:25:08.743 --> 02:25:10.645]  You should get Info Wars onesies.
[02:25:10.685 --> 02:25:11.225]  A singlet?
[02:25:11.405 --> 02:25:12.806]  Yeah, for male and for women.
[02:25:12.866 --> 02:25:13.467]  That's what I'll do.
[02:25:13.547 --> 02:25:13.967]  I'll get it.
[02:25:14.127 --> 02:25:16.389]  That is Dr. Nick Begich, Deanna Lorraine.
[02:25:16.529 --> 02:25:17.049]  Hi, Nick.
[02:25:17.189 --> 02:25:21.432]  You're going to be on The War Room with Owen Schroyer, going through the DNC train wreck.
[02:25:21.572 --> 02:25:21.953]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:22.133 --> 02:25:23.334]  Coming up in just about 45 minutes.
[02:25:23.834 --> 02:25:24.474]  Yep, yep.
[02:25:24.794 --> 02:25:25.735]  It'll be a clown show.
[02:25:25.755 --> 02:25:31.797]  And if you watched any of it last night, you will see what an absolute disaster of a clown show is.
[02:25:32.097 --> 02:25:33.517]  And who's driving the clown show?
[02:25:33.717 --> 02:25:34.777]  It's not Joe Biden.
[02:25:35.138 --> 02:25:36.478]  It is not Michelle Obama.
[02:25:36.738 --> 02:25:39.019]  Who do you think is really driving this clown show?
[02:25:39.059 --> 02:25:40.039]  Is it George Soros?
[02:25:40.499 --> 02:25:41.240]  Is it above him?
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:42.220]  Right?
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:43.520]  I think it's an off world.
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:44.461]  I'll be serious.
[02:25:44.541 --> 02:25:45.081]  Yeah, be serious.
[02:25:45.121 --> 02:25:48.342]  Everything, I don't get into flying saucers and all that stuff esoterically.
[02:25:48.982 --> 02:25:52.443]  Just as a scientist, as a researcher, the whole thing's anti-human.
[02:25:52.843 --> 02:25:58.905]  To suppress human potential, turn us against each other, and stop us going type 1 civilization.
[02:25:59.265 --> 02:26:12.270]  Let's ask one of the major trailblazers, there's a few people like David Icke, a trailblazer of esoteric, but around the same time he emerged, Dr. Nick Baggage, whose dad was a famous congressman, brother a senator, I think he's the most influential of the trio.
[02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:18.072]  Gardnick Begich exposed HAARP, the cell towers, all of it with science.
[02:26:18.692 --> 02:26:19.653]  Let's ask that question.
[02:26:19.673 --> 02:26:20.353]  Let him take over.
[02:26:20.393 --> 02:26:21.193]  He's got his own agenda.
[02:26:21.954 --> 02:26:26.936]  Who is at the center of the web, the bottom of the rabbit hole, the top of the mountain, however you look at it?
[02:26:27.336 --> 02:26:28.096]  What runs this?
[02:26:28.777 --> 02:26:31.438]  At just a base level, it looks pretty anti-human.
[02:26:31.738 --> 02:26:33.839]  Dr. Begich, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:26:33.879 --> 02:26:34.239]  Take over.
[02:26:35.339 --> 02:26:38.221]  Well, thanks for having me again, Alex.
[02:26:38.281 --> 02:26:45.926]  You know, when I look at this whole structure, you know, it's really the same set of players at the very top.
[02:26:46.026 --> 02:26:57.754]  It's a lot of economic interests that look at the average person as a herd, really, detached from humanity in a lot of ways.
[02:26:57.814 --> 02:26:59.795]  And a lot of these individuals are detached.
[02:27:00.462 --> 02:27:12.164]  And when you think about, listening to the last segments, thinking about dehumanizing people, taking us away from each other, this is kind of a major piece of that.
[02:27:12.485 --> 02:27:20.666]  You know, the thing that signs are now saying, look away, don't make eye contact, don't look at anybody, wear your mask.
[02:27:20.706 --> 02:27:26.267]  You can't even express true emotion when you're covered up.
[02:27:26.487 --> 02:27:27.208]  They're being honest.
[02:27:27.288 --> 02:27:29.088]  It's about ending human connection.
[02:27:29.958 --> 02:27:30.198]  Right.
[02:27:30.258 --> 02:27:31.278]  No facial expressions.
[02:27:31.539 --> 02:27:32.599]  That is so satanic.
[02:27:32.639 --> 02:27:33.599]  Sorry, I'm going to shut up.
[02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:35.140]  Go ahead.
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:37.561]  No, and it really is, Alex, and it's that.
[02:27:37.621 --> 02:27:49.705]  It's taking the humanity out, substituting electronics, and getting us more and more embedded on systems that track every move you make and every breath you take.
[02:27:50.025 --> 02:27:52.786]  And that's what's really happening.
[02:27:52.926 --> 02:27:59.188]  And as you look at public meetings going to virtualists, you know, you're dealing with
[02:27:59.748 --> 02:28:05.030]  Public policy being made in a vacuum where people aren't allowed to attend meetings.
[02:28:05.390 --> 02:28:15.873]  All of this sort of removes the human factor further and further away from the decision makers and decision making and from one another, which ultimately is where it all begins.
[02:28:17.414 --> 02:28:18.654]  And that's really what we're seeing.
[02:28:19.114 --> 02:28:24.696]  This kind of fracturing, if you will, of humanity in so many different ways.
[02:28:26.997 --> 02:28:27.937]  You know, thinking about
[02:28:29.453 --> 02:28:31.494]  Where we go, where we go next.
[02:28:32.935 --> 02:28:38.037]  Maybe this is the big challenge for listeners and for this century for this election.
[02:28:38.537 --> 02:28:48.221]  Certainly, all of the power and forces pushing against the Trump administration now, and we're low on time.
[02:28:48.261 --> 02:28:51.082]  You know, you got very few days till election, I think 83, 84 days.
[02:28:53.123 --> 02:28:54.104]  We're counted down.
[02:28:54.404 --> 02:28:58.307]  And if there's a October surprise, it ought to be coming out now.
[02:28:58.988 --> 02:29:05.452]  As we get closer to election, it will have less and less impact and media becomes more and more manipulated.
[02:29:05.492 --> 02:29:07.774]  And that's where time is of the essence.
[02:29:07.814 --> 02:29:10.956]  So people need to get involved, get engaged.
[02:29:12.437 --> 02:29:14.138]  And let's see what happens in this cycle.
[02:29:14.218 --> 02:29:17.981]  I mean, this is a big reset on two different directions.
[02:29:18.161 --> 02:29:20.463]  One is, are we going to reset?
[02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:26.694]  Or are we going to wait till January and let them reset us at the next economic forum?
[02:29:27.354 --> 02:29:31.959]  And I think that's kind of the baseline of where we are today in so much of this.
[02:29:34.741 --> 02:29:38.584]  And looking forward, you know, where does it really begin and end?
[02:29:38.665 --> 02:29:43.529]  Is personal privacy something we've been talking about for a long time on this network?
[02:29:44.963 --> 02:29:56.956]  When you think about the work that we began 25 and more years ago, Alex was starting, we were starting around the same time, maybe a year or two before.
[02:29:57.822 --> 02:30:10.230]  But what we saw was a change in the way technology would be used, and we saw it moving very, very rapidly in a direction of increasing controls.
[02:30:10.250 --> 02:30:15.534]  9-11 was kind of the first trigger point, if you will, for a reset.
[02:30:15.574 --> 02:30:21.177]  That's where personal privacy started to evaporate, where fear was really pushed out.
[02:30:23.087 --> 02:30:24.568]  In volumes, and it was looked for.
[02:30:24.669 --> 02:30:29.633]  You know, we talked years ago about a document by the U.S.
[02:30:29.673 --> 02:30:33.196]  Army War College called the Revolution in Military Affairs.
[02:30:33.256 --> 02:30:45.327]  And what it said is that it would create an environment of fear and uncertainty using international drug trafficking and international terrorism as the central themes.
[02:30:45.668 --> 02:30:46.568]  And this was in the late 1980s.
[02:30:47.788 --> 02:30:54.931]  You look at what happened through the 90s and going into this century, that's what it was all about.
[02:30:55.171 --> 02:31:01.893]  Generating a certain level of fear about these adversaries that you couldn't really touch or quantify.
[02:31:02.473 --> 02:31:03.974]  Drug dealers, terrorism.
[02:31:04.454 --> 02:31:09.316]  But if you could whip the public up, this document said, Revolutionary Military Affairs,
[02:31:10.114 --> 02:31:20.242]  That you would have people willing to suspend their civil liberties, suspend their freedom, suspend their rights in exchange for the illusion of freedom.
[02:31:21.022 --> 02:31:22.143]  And this was the plan.
[02:31:22.183 --> 02:31:31.250]  They knew, it even said so, that it violated the Constitution, these approaches, but that people would look the other way and look at the last 25 years.
[02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.790]  Slowly, surely,
[02:31:36.039 --> 02:31:39.901]  One degree at a time, cranking up the temperature so you never notice.
[02:31:40.701 --> 02:31:41.902]  And that's where we are today.
[02:31:42.022 --> 02:31:51.166]  Or as the late Chuck Harter used to say, you know, it's a bunch of bologna being sliced away one slice at a time until the bologna is all gone, right?
[02:31:52.006 --> 02:31:54.427]  And that's where we are in the 21st century.
[02:31:54.567 --> 02:32:00.470]  Entering 2020, are we going to have a clear vision of the future or the obscure vision?
[02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:05.392]  The not the 2020 vision that InfoWars provides?
[02:32:06.201 --> 02:32:20.449]  This is the time that we need to wake up, look around, be calm in the middle of this storm, be the center of that storm as it whips around us, knowing that we're the tip of the spear.
[02:32:20.969 --> 02:32:23.991]  It's about information warfare, and this is a critical moment.
[02:32:24.331 --> 02:32:34.016]  Support this network, take a look at these messages coming up, and support what we're doing on the InfoWars, and let's make America great again.
[02:32:34.625 --> 02:32:37.646]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, we'll be right back after these brief messages.
[02:32:39.867 --> 02:32:49.931]  Hey, thank you for being here and it's good to be here on this Friday afternoon in most of the country and still a little before noon here in Anchorage, Alaska.
[02:32:52.772 --> 02:33:03.116]  You know, thinking about all of the things in the news right now and what's happening today can be extraordinarily unsettling for sure.
[02:33:03.937 --> 02:33:09.853]  And it's been a long time coming, you know, and people go, well, how can you even think about being calm in a mess like this?
[02:33:11.344 --> 02:33:11.824]  Excuse me.
[02:33:11.844 --> 02:33:14.506]  And it is the requirement, actually.
[02:33:14.526 --> 02:33:16.087]  It is what's required right now.
[02:33:16.187 --> 02:33:29.714]  Because let me go over some things I've always covered in the past and what happens when structures, government in particular, private sector also, uses fear as the motivator.
[02:33:30.054 --> 02:33:31.955]  And you see it because it's very effective.
[02:33:31.995 --> 02:33:39.439]  It works really good in the short run, but doesn't hold in the long run because fear eventually dissipates to the calm.
[02:33:40.163 --> 02:33:43.565]  And so here's one of the things I can point out.
[02:33:43.645 --> 02:34:03.779]  When you look at an EEG, which measures brain activity, and you look at what the brain is doing when you're in fear or anxiety or hate or any of these anger, any of the negative, what we call negative emotions, what you see is generally incoherent brain patterns, the kind not associated with higher-ordered thinking.
[02:34:05.019 --> 02:34:15.924]  And not just higher-ordered thinking, but higher-ordered being, because in a state of fear, you don't reach what are referred to as higher states of awareness or consciousness.
[02:34:16.545 --> 02:34:23.968]  And this is extraordinarily important, because if you want to short-circuit humanity, you keep them in a state of anxiety and fear.
[02:34:24.468 --> 02:34:32.552]  See, that's the very first step in breaking down a culture or society, is to inject enough fear to suspend
[02:34:33.559 --> 02:34:36.700]  What you consider normal and what are we seeing in the world today?
[02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:38.260]  Exactly that.
[02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:47.683]  The opportunity for suspending everything that's normal presented itself with the pandemic as being played out across the world.
[02:34:47.803 --> 02:35:00.907]  And, you know, when you think about the economic impacts, but more importantly, lay all of those physical things aside and go down deeper again and talk about what does that do?
[02:35:02.287 --> 02:35:03.468]  To the human spirit.
[02:35:03.928 --> 02:35:20.461]  When you inject fear from all angles, you take away people's employment, you create a total environment of uncertainty, you close all of the schools, you close higher education, you shut it all down and you go, well, this is the new normal.
[02:35:21.822 --> 02:35:22.343]  No, it isn't.
[02:35:23.642 --> 02:35:27.423]  This is not normal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:27.443 --> 02:35:28.564]  This is abnormal.
[02:35:29.064 --> 02:35:30.164]  This is not normal.
[02:35:30.505 --> 02:35:32.385]  This is not a new anything.
[02:35:32.425 --> 02:35:37.707]  This is an old story with a new suit, a new opportunity.
[02:35:38.728 --> 02:35:50.292]  In the age of an international global elite and an international global connected population,
[02:35:51.109 --> 02:35:51.830]  Through the Internet.
[02:35:52.090 --> 02:35:54.932]  And now that is being divided.
[02:35:55.053 --> 02:36:09.425]  Okay, you've got a global elite that now takes control of the communication networks so that individuals who in our belief system are the foundation of government, we are in fact government.
[02:36:10.166 --> 02:36:16.672]  Government exists by virtue of the fact that we give government power as individual souls, as sovereign souls.
[02:36:17.526 --> 02:36:36.821]  And when you start to remove that aspect and push us into some squishy collective of group think, you see, that runs counter to what we are as created individuals, certainly within a larger consciousness, within a larger creation we exist.
[02:36:37.381 --> 02:36:46.168]  But we still function as individuals with free choice and the right and human privilege
[02:36:47.313 --> 02:36:56.095]  And birthright, actually, to move as an individual sovereign to create freely with liberty, right?
[02:36:56.515 --> 02:36:57.815]  What does liberty mean?
[02:36:58.435 --> 02:37:07.136]  It means the lowest amount of government intrusion in our lives and the lowest amount of, let's call it, corporate intrusion in our lives.
[02:37:07.517 --> 02:37:14.818]  How about the lowest level of intrusion into our individual lives as the basis of our sovereignty?
[02:37:15.678 --> 02:37:15.838]  Now,
[02:37:17.205 --> 02:37:27.092]  250 years ago, as people were starting to debate and talk about what that might look like, personal privacy was enshrined in our Constitution.
[02:37:27.492 --> 02:37:32.756]  Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly in the First Amendment to that Constitution.
[02:37:33.677 --> 02:37:41.143]  Foundational concepts of humanity, if you will, to allow us the opportunity to self-govern.
[02:37:41.804 --> 02:37:57.162]  And when the Internet, which is now the global communication vehicle, is being channel locked, gridlocked, if you will, into a traffic jam of political correctness, then it's time for a change.
[02:37:58.224 --> 02:38:00.967]  This is what has to be broken up.
[02:38:01.801 --> 02:38:06.784]  And here's the thing about breaking up big corporations, the owners end up making more money.
[02:38:06.844 --> 02:38:13.408]  If you look at the history of AT&T and some of the others, as they broke them up, they just made more money and got to spread it around.
[02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:16.510]  And that's the way capitalism works.
[02:38:16.590 --> 02:38:17.231]  I get that.
[02:38:17.671 --> 02:38:22.094]  But when you attack something, it's not just about breaking up the monopoly power.
[02:38:22.434 --> 02:38:23.835]  That is not the solution.
[02:38:24.295 --> 02:38:30.099]  It's making it criminal, a criminal event to violate your personal privacy in the 21st century.
[02:38:31.408 --> 02:38:37.090]  The same as it would be if someone kicked in your front door and started rifling through your files and papers without a warrant.
[02:38:37.570 --> 02:38:42.231]  The same should be true on the internet and all forms of electronic communication.
[02:38:42.732 --> 02:38:46.213]  You should always be protected as a fundamental human right.
[02:38:46.693 --> 02:38:56.296]  Now, this doesn't mean that you sign some complicated, long, drawn-out agreement when you sign up for the app or the this or the that.
[02:38:57.017 --> 02:39:08.322]  Where you wave all of your human rights away so they can just pilfer you like rifling through a treasure chest of someone else's owning.
[02:39:09.306 --> 02:39:10.367]  This is what's happening.
[02:39:10.407 --> 02:39:11.927]  You've been commoditized.
[02:39:11.987 --> 02:39:37.920]  You've been made into a commodity called a human being and you generate so much money for the pharmaceutical industry, for the automobile industry, for all these industries that we function as consumers and now through the pipeline of the big multinational distribution hubs because little mom and pops have been wiped out of the face of the planet because of the crap going on right now to manipulate
[02:39:38.604 --> 02:39:39.305]  Us even further.
[02:39:39.825 --> 02:39:54.818]  Through fear, where the reptilian brain kicks in, your flight or fight response kicks in, and then the propaganda just moves you like a hurricane, whipping you around until you're completely destroyed.
[02:39:55.058 --> 02:40:06.848]  Or, you make a different choice, and you stay calm, and you occupy the center of that storm, and you see all of this around you, and then you choose deliberately how you'll engage each and every thing.
[02:40:07.930 --> 02:40:09.030]  Now, the trick.
[02:40:09.550 --> 02:40:10.671]  Okay, there is a couple tricks.
[02:40:11.271 --> 02:40:15.191]  One of them is control of emotion because this is your creative force.
[02:40:15.251 --> 02:40:17.212]  You give it to someone else when you run into fear.
[02:40:17.252 --> 02:40:18.152]  You just hand it off.
[02:40:18.712 --> 02:40:19.612]  Just give it away.
[02:40:20.132 --> 02:40:20.772]  Don't do that.
[02:40:21.612 --> 02:40:29.234]  Keep this power of your emotion when you're in fear or anxiety or any of these things.
[02:40:30.114 --> 02:40:30.894]  Pay attention.
[02:40:31.874 --> 02:40:32.974]  Look at that emotion.
[02:40:33.014 --> 02:40:35.795]  Don't let it carry you a wave like a wave
[02:40:36.593 --> 02:40:37.754]  Like a tidal wave?
[02:40:38.314 --> 02:40:39.915]  Sit on the top of the wave.
[02:40:40.555 --> 02:40:41.976]  Observe the emotion.
[02:40:42.076 --> 02:40:43.196]  Do experience it.
[02:40:43.837 --> 02:40:46.478]  But then you control it when you pay attention.
[02:40:47.058 --> 02:40:51.521]  This is the trick for the 21st century is to pay attention.
[02:40:52.281 --> 02:40:52.861]  Internally.
[02:40:53.582 --> 02:40:54.202]  Externally.
[02:40:54.642 --> 02:40:55.342]  Pay attention.
[02:40:56.343 --> 02:40:57.083]  You're in fear.
[02:40:57.123 --> 02:40:58.024]  You're being herded.
[02:40:58.564 --> 02:40:59.384]  You're giving up.
[02:40:59.805 --> 02:41:01.305]  You're handing off your power.
[02:41:01.345 --> 02:41:02.166]  Don't do that anymore.
[02:41:02.846 --> 02:41:03.667]  That's the mistake.
[02:41:04.187 --> 02:41:06.248]  That is the mistake.
[02:41:07.085 --> 02:41:33.895]  Fear is the adversary and fear is the tool because here's what happens when you combine thought with belief, faith, belief, what you know to be right and true, and you combine thought, belief, faith, and then the emotion, love, empathy, compassion, or you can do fear, anxiety, hate, but you'll create with either one and one creates
[02:41:34.750 --> 02:41:38.375]  Destructively and one creates constructively.
[02:41:38.875 --> 02:41:40.517]  How will you create?
[02:41:41.358 --> 02:41:44.502]  How will we create together the reality that we see?
[02:41:44.542 --> 02:41:54.234]  We would be herded to where all of that negative emotional energy flows into the pipeline of creativity for an evil outcome because that is the world today.
[02:41:55.276 --> 02:41:57.697]  To change the world, we have to change ourselves.
[02:41:57.777 --> 02:42:04.139]  We have to look internally and then reflect externally in a way that shows that we are the tip of the spear.
[02:42:04.199 --> 02:42:04.899]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:06.340 --> 02:42:07.380]  And welcome back.
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:09.861]  It's always good to be here on a Friday afternoon.
[02:42:09.921 --> 02:42:17.323]  And, you know, talking about just what's going on in the world, you know, we can all get pretty excited about about all of it.
[02:42:17.563 --> 02:42:23.085]  And and we do because it's pretty disturbing when you see so much so fast.
[02:42:23.712 --> 02:42:40.582]  And, you know, and part of it is I'm going to call it the whole idea of using the phrase false narrative really just bothers me because this whole concept is a relatively new one in terms of political speech.
[02:42:40.602 --> 02:42:44.464]  And I want to talk a little bit about this because I was talking before the break about how
[02:42:45.202 --> 02:42:51.707]  Combining thought motion is kind of the essence of creative power as you push out into the world.
[02:42:51.748 --> 02:42:55.311]  And this is this is literally the truth matter.
[02:42:55.331 --> 02:43:04.058]  And those involved in the occult understand how you combine that energy to create
[02:43:05.154 --> 02:43:05.755]  Negative.
[02:43:06.175 --> 02:43:14.082]  And likewise, if you combine your choice and in a different direction, it creates a different outcome.
[02:43:14.122 --> 02:43:21.448]  And I think that's the important message of the day, because this is the root of creativity.
[02:43:21.509 --> 02:43:26.073]  Now, part of this can get altered if you think about what's been happening over the years.
[02:43:26.833 --> 02:43:34.314]  The phrase political correctness, the phrase a narrative, a new narrative has come into play.
[02:43:34.935 --> 02:43:36.615]  Let's talk about that just a little bit.
[02:43:37.095 --> 02:43:39.576]  A narrative is a script, all right?
[02:43:39.756 --> 02:43:46.537]  A narrative is something you write down and then you follow like a plan or a script or a speech that's already written.
[02:43:48.177 --> 02:43:51.138]  No, we don't have a narrative going on.
[02:43:51.458 --> 02:43:52.058]  That's again
[02:43:52.987 --> 02:43:53.828]  More B.S.
[02:43:53.848 --> 02:43:55.589]  they're trying to sell as fertilizer.
[02:43:56.409 --> 02:43:59.531]  Its narratives are scripted.
[02:43:59.852 --> 02:44:02.433]  That's not how human beings are intended to operate.
[02:44:02.553 --> 02:44:03.014]  Scripted.
[02:44:03.094 --> 02:44:03.914]  That's not how we do it.
[02:44:04.995 --> 02:44:07.176]  The other one is political correctness.
[02:44:07.697 --> 02:44:08.758]  What does that really say?
[02:44:09.258 --> 02:44:17.303]  That means we have to say things so that people are not offended by what we say.
[02:44:17.423 --> 02:44:19.985]  So we get to a political neutral.
[02:44:20.609 --> 02:44:21.149]  More or less.
[02:44:21.209 --> 02:44:22.430]  We don't offend anyone.
[02:44:22.450 --> 02:44:25.272]  We just kind of mush our way through life.
[02:44:25.352 --> 02:44:26.853]  And that's kind of the concept.
[02:44:27.493 --> 02:44:28.574]  That doesn't work either.
[02:44:29.215 --> 02:44:38.300]  Because within a vigorous democracy or democratic republic like ours, you get this invigorated debate.
[02:44:38.801 --> 02:44:42.323]  And then in our structured government, we have representative government.
[02:44:42.363 --> 02:44:46.926]  So somebody takes that debate, refines it and creates legislation.
[02:44:47.106 --> 02:44:48.787]  You hope that's the way it works.
[02:44:49.672 --> 02:45:04.205]  But when you have powerful interests that are able to sway the politician and the narrative for the public through control of media, and then they even create a new phrase, fake news.
[02:45:05.086 --> 02:45:05.827]  Fake news.
[02:45:06.687 --> 02:45:08.849]  Well, it's not news if it's fake.
[02:45:10.371 --> 02:45:10.691]  Right?
[02:45:10.811 --> 02:45:12.893]  That's just fiction, is what that's called.
[02:45:13.253 --> 02:45:14.314]  Not fake news.
[02:45:14.354 --> 02:45:16.376]  We already have a word for that, it's called fiction.
[02:45:17.003 --> 02:45:19.545]  You have fiction writing and you have non-fiction writing.
[02:45:20.225 --> 02:45:22.887]  Fake news is like an oxymoron.
[02:45:22.927 --> 02:45:27.209]  It's like what I talked about last time I was on doing the impossible.
[02:45:27.249 --> 02:45:28.810]  How can you do something you don't believe in?
[02:45:28.850 --> 02:45:29.311]  You can't.
[02:45:30.311 --> 02:45:37.196]  So these are part of the structure of the new narrative is to create a new way of thinking that really doesn't work.
[02:45:37.796 --> 02:45:44.340]  So it creates a conflict mentally right off the get go, which is a way you start to break down the human being.
[02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:45.761]  Now, the other way you do it is
[02:45:46.806 --> 02:45:55.748]  Through the method of political correctness, and it is a method, because if you get people to start saying things, first you get them to shut up.
[02:45:56.348 --> 02:45:57.668]  Okay, that's called tolerance.
[02:45:57.748 --> 02:46:04.070]  We wrap that around this whole concept, because that's supposed to be some virtuous thing, to be tolerant.
[02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:05.390]  Oh, I'm tolerant.
[02:46:05.950 --> 02:46:07.071]  What does that really say?
[02:46:07.151 --> 02:46:12.332]  That means you shut up about something you believe in, in favor of something you don't believe in.
[02:46:12.632 --> 02:46:13.592]  That's called tolerance.
[02:46:14.412 --> 02:46:17.014]  A deeper level, and I've said it before, is acceptance.
[02:46:17.654 --> 02:46:21.677]  That's where you see what is and you accept what is, but you don't necessarily go along with it.
[02:46:22.457 --> 02:46:23.498]  But you see what is.
[02:46:23.958 --> 02:46:29.061]  You don't argue with facts, but you may interpret how you deal with those facts differently.
[02:46:29.681 --> 02:46:38.607]  So political narratives and political speech and political correctness take all that away and get you to first suspend what you believe in and not say it anymore.
[02:46:39.227 --> 02:46:41.649]  And then when you open your mouth to start saying,
[02:46:42.583 --> 02:46:46.426]  What you know you're expected to say, as opposed to what you believe in.
[02:46:46.927 --> 02:46:57.656]  Now, that is the way to turn off part of your brain that is the consciousness part, the part that connects you to the infinite, the part that dials you in.
[02:46:58.617 --> 02:47:07.064]  OK, when you turn that off and then you just function in the flesh and the world and in fear, then you fall.
[02:47:07.304 --> 02:47:09.706]  That's called the fallen state of man, basically.
[02:47:10.513 --> 02:47:12.274]  It's a simple explanation.
[02:47:12.534 --> 02:47:15.336]  Not a lot of flowery, complex language in that.
[02:47:15.376 --> 02:47:15.977]  It's just simple.
[02:47:17.057 --> 02:47:18.378]  Faith is also simple.
[02:47:18.478 --> 02:47:20.460]  It's acting on what you believe in.
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:22.541]  Not doing the impossible.
[02:47:22.581 --> 02:47:23.582]  Acting on what you believe in.
[02:47:24.042 --> 02:47:26.443]  Which is a big part of what I've been saying lately.
[02:47:26.483 --> 02:47:31.367]  Because when we combine, internally first, find that peace.
[02:47:31.467 --> 02:47:33.488]  Find that empathy.
[02:47:33.568 --> 02:47:34.248]  Find that love.
[02:47:34.308 --> 02:47:35.309]  Find that compassion.
[02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:38.191]  Find what it is that makes your core different.
[02:47:39.105 --> 02:47:47.655]  And then project that in the world with force and power of knowing that what you do matters.
[02:47:48.275 --> 02:47:50.398]  Everything you do matters.
[02:47:51.479 --> 02:47:56.124]  And so don't accept the narrative of, oh, you have no power.
[02:47:56.444 --> 02:47:57.966]  Oh, you can't do anything.
[02:47:58.026 --> 02:48:00.449]  And oh, I got to hide in my closet.
[02:48:01.072 --> 02:48:02.653]  For the rest of eternity.
[02:48:02.833 --> 02:48:04.893]  No, that is not what we are.
[02:48:05.173 --> 02:48:06.594]  And that is not who we are.
[02:48:07.114 --> 02:48:10.195]  And that is not our state of remembering.
[02:48:10.235 --> 02:48:13.536]  Because what I've said often is it's not about evolution.
[02:48:13.556 --> 02:48:19.499]  It's about remembering what we are as human beings and then begin to project differently.
[02:48:19.539 --> 02:48:24.540]  And part of that is recognizing the divinity in each and every person.
[02:48:25.081 --> 02:48:28.722]  And that requires then a level of respect.
[02:48:29.890 --> 02:48:34.038]  Whether you're shown that same respect or not, it requires that of you and me.
[02:48:34.559 --> 02:48:38.207]  That we project differently and that we take our power back.
[02:48:39.221 --> 02:48:46.427]  Let go of fear, take our power back, and begin to project in the world constructively in different ways.
[02:48:46.847 --> 02:48:55.694]  All the ways that we can, individually, because that is what creates a bigger collective, if you will.
[02:48:55.754 --> 02:48:59.857]  But it's individuals that drive that, not the other way around.
[02:49:00.504 --> 02:49:11.849]  And so, again, the idea of political debate, of being able to meet and congregate, and more importantly, face elected officials in public.
[02:49:12.309 --> 02:49:27.016]  You know, the idea, like here in Anchorage, some of the most controversial issues are in front of our local assembly, and they're all hiding in their houses with their mute buttons on, watching TV while their meetings are happening and the public is testifying.
[02:49:27.356 --> 02:49:31.178]  Because now they can really ignore you and not be embarrassed by it because you can't see them.
[02:49:32.499 --> 02:49:37.642]  That is not the type of government we created, at least in this country.
[02:49:37.682 --> 02:49:39.603]  Star Chamber sort of government, right?
[02:49:40.063 --> 02:49:43.766]  But now they can just hide through layers of electronics.
[02:49:44.826 --> 02:49:46.547]  No, this is not the way.
[02:49:47.208 --> 02:49:48.768]  This is not the path forward.
[02:49:49.329 --> 02:49:56.513]  It's reflect internally, gather our power again, let go of fear and move with confidence into a world that we can change.
[02:49:57.506 --> 02:50:00.989]  And here's what I know about that is it doesn't require a mass.
[02:50:01.009 --> 02:50:02.990]  You know, don't wait around for the big majority.
[02:50:03.691 --> 02:50:05.152]  It always starts with a few.
[02:50:05.953 --> 02:50:11.517]  A few voices and then a few powerful voices.
[02:50:11.577 --> 02:50:15.480]  And then the most important thing is every individual.
[02:50:15.540 --> 02:50:17.582]  And here's what's buried in all of that.
[02:50:19.083 --> 02:50:20.204]  We think we're small.
[02:50:21.172 --> 02:50:22.853]  And this is part of the big lie, too.
[02:50:23.494 --> 02:50:26.857]  Think back on the story of the Widow's Might.
[02:50:27.017 --> 02:50:29.359]  It's a small that is actually big.
[02:50:29.399 --> 02:50:32.641]  And I've said it often because we underestimate our power.
[02:50:32.681 --> 02:50:35.604]  And that's part of the big lie, too, is, oh, you can't do anything.
[02:50:36.144 --> 02:50:38.726]  Do what you can.
[02:50:40.167 --> 02:50:41.028]  That has hope in it.
[02:50:41.709 --> 02:50:42.870]  That has faith in it.
[02:50:43.570 --> 02:50:48.014]  That has all the things and all the ingredients that change the world.
[02:50:48.988 --> 02:50:49.188]  In it.
[02:50:49.668 --> 02:50:54.950]  If you begin to act in a different way, project what you believe internally, externally.
[02:50:54.970 --> 02:51:01.252]  Don't just parrot your religion, your philosophy, whatever it is that you say you believe in.
[02:51:02.492 --> 02:51:08.194]  And don't try and explain it all to someone else because you're filling them with words they don't understand.
[02:51:08.774 --> 02:51:14.896]  Act differently and maybe someone will ask you a question of, wow, how come you're so different?
[02:51:15.617 --> 02:51:16.857]  What makes you unique?
[02:51:17.811 --> 02:51:31.854]  Why is it that you're always in this certain state even when everything is flying off the shelves around you and wheels are rolling off the car as you're driving down the road and you're still driving down the road?
[02:51:32.755 --> 02:51:34.615]  It's because of your faith.
[02:51:34.715 --> 02:51:36.135]  It's because of who you are.
[02:51:36.235 --> 02:51:39.436]  It's because of what we do together in the world.
[02:51:39.536 --> 02:51:47.138]  It's changing the way we see the world by self-reflection, not falling into the group thing.
[02:51:47.947 --> 02:51:49.288]  This is how Hitler did it.
[02:51:50.068 --> 02:51:58.774]  You see, he got people first to suspend their beliefs with political correctness of their day, and then your power was gone.
[02:51:59.774 --> 02:52:00.815]  Remember who you are.
[02:52:01.235 --> 02:52:02.336]  Remember what you are.
[02:52:02.776 --> 02:52:09.500]  Remember the person you look at in the eye is created in the same image and likeness of God that you are.
[02:52:10.081 --> 02:52:15.104]  So act divinely and change the world because that's what we're here to do.
[02:52:15.891 --> 02:52:19.940]  And the hour is late and we are at the tip of the spear.
[02:52:20.181 --> 02:52:21.223]  Five minutes to midnight.
[02:52:21.263 --> 02:52:22.446]  Dr. Nick Vegas signing off.
[02:52:32.745 --> 02:52:36.588]  Just a few months ago, almost every storable food manufacturer was sold out.
[02:52:37.128 --> 02:52:40.471]  They were still taking people's orders, and many of the companies have still not fulfilled them.
[02:52:40.931 --> 02:52:42.652]  All the orders we got in have been fulfilled.
[02:52:42.992 --> 02:52:49.237]  Our supplier's the best, the highest quality, the best containers to transport it as well, and they've got the food with four factories in stock.
[02:52:49.517 --> 02:52:51.759]  Takes them two to four weeks to get it shipped out to you.
[02:52:52.159 --> 02:52:53.900]  You need to order your storable food now.
[02:52:54.240 --> 02:52:55.681]  The world is much more dire.
[02:52:55.881 --> 02:52:57.623]  The economic system is collapsing.
[02:52:57.643 --> 02:52:59.124]  The third world's already starving to death.
[02:52:59.384 --> 02:53:00.685]  Food prices are exploding here.
[02:53:01.406 --> 02:53:05.368]  Uh, the farms and the production plants are shutting down because of the COVID hoax.
[02:53:05.668 --> 02:53:08.990]  You need to get your storable food while you still can at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:53:09.010 --> 02:53:09.791]  It's a 360 win.
[02:53:10.071 --> 02:53:11.311]  It also funds our operation.
[02:53:11.592 --> 02:53:13.953]  But you need to get it, whether it's three months, six months, a year.
[02:53:14.253 --> 02:53:18.755]  You need to get that now and have that checkbox off of being prepared and being self-sufficient.
[02:53:18.775 --> 02:53:22.477]  We also have high quality water filtration and air filtration at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:53:22.497 --> 02:53:23.318]  They're an absolute must.
[02:53:23.338 --> 02:53:27.300]  But whatever you do, ladies and gentlemen, don't wait until a bigger crisis comes.
[02:53:27.740 --> 02:53:29.381]  Don't wait till everybody panics.
[02:53:29.621 --> 02:53:30.062]  Take action.
[02:53:30.082 --> 02:53:30.562]  Get ready now.
[02:53:32.543 --> 02:53:38.008]  Owen Schroyer here, host of the InfoWars War Room every day from 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:53:38.188 --> 02:53:43.193]  and that means I have to follow up after the big man and that is not an easy task.
[02:53:43.293 --> 02:53:48.417]  So I need to be as focused and energized as possible every day at 3 o'clock.
[02:53:48.557 --> 02:53:48.978]  So yes,
[02:53:49.278 --> 02:53:51.939]  I am on performance-enhancing drugs.
[02:53:52.400 --> 02:54:14.911]  It's the combination of the energy of the turbo force, the focus of the brain force, and then the VasoBeat Complete, which is a beet supplement, which act as a vasodilator, which makes sure that the nutrients and supplements that you're intaking are getting all throughout the body so that I can maintain proper focus and energy for three hours and beyond.
[02:54:15.111 --> 02:54:16.392]  It's almost three o'clock.
[02:54:16.612 --> 02:54:23.055]  That means it's time to take my performance enhancers that I have conveniently stashed right here at my desk.
[02:54:23.176 --> 02:54:27.018]  I literally will never host a war room without them.
[02:54:27.198 --> 02:54:30.760]  It starts with the Turbo Force right here.
[02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:34.322]  Just get your cup of water, pour in the Turbo Force.
[02:54:34.562 --> 02:54:37.183]  I then take my Vezo Beat Complete right here.
[02:54:38.024 --> 02:54:40.265]  One dropper, two droppers.
[02:54:40.986 --> 02:54:43.087]  Stir it up just a little bit for good measure.
[02:54:44.710 --> 02:55:02.599]  And then, with the energy from the TurboForce and the nitrates in the VesoBeat Complete, with the Focus from BrainForce, with the Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and all the other supplements that are inside of that, those are the supplements I take.
[02:55:03.678 --> 02:55:10.100]  Every day, right before I go on air, for maximum performance, maximum focus, maximum energy.
[02:55:10.540 --> 02:55:23.364]  And the good news is, once I finish drinking this Turbo Force, I've got energy for about 10 hours, so I can continue working, pass the show, work on other things, go and lift weights, run, whatever I need or want to do.
[02:55:23.564 --> 02:55:31.927]  It's all with the Turbo Force, the Brain Force, and the Vezo Beat Complete Trifecta, available only at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:55:32.708 --> 02:55:39.096]  I've talked to the EMS and I've talked to medical doctors, and what makes you nauseated is not just the smell of the piss, but we call the smell of lung piss.
[02:55:39.116 --> 02:55:40.678]  It has that sweet nauseating smell.
[02:55:40.698 --> 02:55:41.759]  It's on the face.
[02:55:41.839 --> 02:55:44.002]  And what it does, it's a sweet stench.
[02:55:44.162 --> 02:55:46.465]  It's like throwing up rotten meat.
[02:55:46.545 --> 02:55:47.907]  It is the crap of dust mites.
[02:55:48.393 --> 02:55:52.515]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist-run neighborhoods?
[02:55:52.895 --> 02:55:59.419]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing, and InfoWars Store has the solution.
[02:55:59.639 --> 02:56:12.086]  InfoWars has created the most powerful herbal lung cleanse and respiratory support product on the market, with over a thousand types of mold and mildew, toxic chemicals, and yes, dust mites.

[02:56:32.653 --> 02:56:37.275]  Four years ago, I added a member to the InfoWars Life team who has developed
[02:56:40.299 --> 02:56:42.401]  We believe it is the strongest in the market.
[02:56:42.421 --> 02:56:44.803]  If somebody else has got one, we don't know about it.
[02:57:07.443 --> 02:57:09.024]  Now, folks absolutely love it.
[02:57:09.064 --> 02:57:10.884]  They love the results that they get from it.
[02:57:11.624 --> 02:57:14.205]  Now, this is apples and oranges because it complements bodies.
[02:57:14.725 --> 02:57:20.927]  But, going back over seven years ago, we had a major supplier of high-quality, organic turmeric that was liquid that you take into the tongue.
[02:57:21.307 --> 02:57:22.087]  And people loved it.
[02:57:22.368 --> 02:57:27.569]  Then we could no longer get any more because that company was so overloaded with orders from other people.
[02:57:27.809 --> 02:57:30.210]  Because getting high-quality turmeric is really a tough thing to do.
[02:57:30.650 --> 02:57:36.597]  We've now secured another company in the last year that has even higher quality turmeric concentrate.
[02:57:36.617 --> 02:57:40.121]  This is one ingredient, pure turmeric extract.
[02:57:40.342 --> 02:57:42.324]  It's the liquid type, taken out of the tongue.
[02:57:42.404 --> 02:57:45.628]  If you love bodies, I think you're really going to love this product.
[02:57:46.028 --> 02:57:50.771]  Some people around the office that have tried it say it's better than bodies, some say it's not, some say it supercharges it.
[02:57:51.232 --> 02:58:00.739]  All I know is this is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, turmeric extracts under the tongue you can find out there, and it's got a different delivery system.
[02:58:01.059 --> 02:58:12.727]  All I know is this is one of the strongest turmeric concentrates that's liquid, that you take under the tongue, that you're going to find out there, and that our developer is extremely proud of it, and the reviews we're getting internally are amazing.
[02:58:13.027 --> 02:58:16.449]  It's 25% off out of the gates at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:16.709 --> 02:58:25.493]  I suggest you secure yours and try it today because if you like bodies, you're going to love our new product, Pure Turmeric Extract at InfoWarsTore.com.
