[00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:19.079]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:36.261]  A so-called anti-fascist website is encouraging, quote, all manner of physical violence against Trump supporters and capitalists.
[00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:41.464]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:47.949]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.590]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.932]  I'll join a million other people surrounding the United States Capitol.
[00:00:52.932 --> 00:00:57.575]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:01.502]  This is a national emergency.
[00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:06.486]  Joe Biden says he is concerned President Trump will try to steal the November election.
[00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:08.527]  This president is going to try to steal this election.
[00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:19.195]  This is a trial run for the President of the United States, who may be organizing to not accept what happens when we have the election.
[00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:26.600]  If he loses, and I expect that he will, then we have to be prepared for what he is going to do in the immediate aftermath of such a loss.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.302]  Whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving.
[00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:35.508]  Here you have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[00:01:35.508 --> 00:01:42.694]  And you have so many rank-and-file military personnel saying, whoa, we're not a military state.
[00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:44.035]  This is not who we are.
[00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:49.060]  If he's not elected, is he going to pull out his military?
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.042]  Is he going to engage us?
[00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:52.783]  It's already alluded to.
[00:01:52.783 --> 00:01:54.205]  There may be a civil war.
[00:01:56.363 --> 00:02:04.007]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:06.129]  These are not acts of peaceful protest.
[00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:10.324]  These are acts of domestic terror.
[00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:11.584]  Seriously, Mr. President?
[00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:16.867]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders.
[00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:21.769]  Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration.
[00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.411]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:31.893]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.
[00:02:31.893 --> 00:02:33.014]  Government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:02:37.188 --> 00:02:38.811]  So I have a lot of enemies out there.
[00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:41.115]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:46.203]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing.
[00:02:46.203 --> 00:02:50.209]  But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other president's gonna do what I do.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.542]  It's August 8th on this live Saturday transmission.
[00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:13.786]  We just kicked it off at 2 o'clock, Texas time, Central Standard Broadcasting Worldwide.
[00:03:13.786 --> 00:03:17.729]  I want to thank this incredible crew for coming in and kicking ass with us.
[00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:18.870]  We can bring you this information.
[00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.392]  We're going to be commercial free.
[00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:30.858]  For the next two hours going out on our TV and radio satellites with, I know, hundreds of thousands of people tuning in right now.
[00:03:30.858 --> 00:03:34.301]  And between now and the election, every Saturday, I'll be here live.
[00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.364]  I'm always here Sunday 4 to 6 p.m., not just 11 a.m.
[00:03:37.364 --> 00:03:37.925]  to 3 p.m.
[00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:41.489]  during the weekdays with the David Knight Show before that and Owen Schroeder in the War Room.
[00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:48.148]  We're also going to do some special nighttime broadcasts with special guests this week coming up.
[00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:56.392]  So be sure and watch for that at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and of course, Banned.Video.
[00:03:56.392 --> 00:03:59.234]  Now you just saw the president from Thursday.
[00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:02.055]  Got almost no attention.
[00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:04.417]  We covered it Friday.
[00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:06.998]  President Trump makes cryptic remark at Ohio speech.
[00:04:06.998 --> 00:04:08.059]  I have a lot of enemies.
[00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:10.380]  This may be the last time you see me for a while.
[00:04:12.844 --> 00:04:16.067]  They are moving against our Republic.
[00:04:16.067 --> 00:04:21.872]  They are attempting to completely collapse this nation.
[00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:26.176]  And it's all under treaty with the UN that traitors in our government signed on to.
[00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:28.338]  Trump has removed us from those treaties.
[00:04:28.338 --> 00:04:31.621]  We'll go over how real Trump is.
[00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:36.685]  And though I get frustrated and wish sometimes he'd do more, he is hamstrung.
[00:04:36.685 --> 00:04:37.126]  He is
[00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:51.059]  Sabotaged by the double and triple agents who work for different power structures around him that continue to not execute the will of the people and the oaths of office that they've sworn.
[00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:56.285]  But most of the power has been removed from the government and is now in corporations and multinational systems.
[00:04:57.113 --> 00:05:03.298]  That's why the president has trouble getting control of the government, because most of it's been transferred out of the American people's hands.
[00:05:03.298 --> 00:05:07.262]  That's why he said we have one more shot to try to regain control of the government.
[00:05:07.262 --> 00:05:13.547]  Doesn't mean our government's perfect, but man, the globalist, chi-com, devil worshiper, pedophile, New World Order government?
[00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:16.350]  Satan's government?
[00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.891]  If they're successful overthrowing the U.S.
[00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:22.896]  government, you're going to look back, I'm going to look back on this and sure wish we'd done more.
[00:05:23.797 --> 00:05:30.001]  That's what I want to say right now to you on this live Saturday afternoon transmission.
[00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:41.109]  History's happening right now, and we're not just spectators on a bench here watching the NBA player, the NFL player, the National Hockey League play.
[00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:44.611]  We're not watching our daughters play volleyball or basketball.
[00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:45.391]  We're not.
[00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:46.292]  All that's fun.
[00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:47.193]  All of it's competitive.
[00:05:47.193 --> 00:05:51.656]  All of it's great, but it's not about the whole future of civilization.
[00:05:51.656 --> 00:05:53.217]  This isn't some NFL Super Bowl.
[00:05:54.588 --> 00:06:00.735]  Game where you got a thousand dollars bet on your team and you sure hope you make that money because you need it to pay the rent.
[00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:06.902]  This is the whole future of humanity as we know it and the evil globalist agenda to take over.
[00:06:08.396 --> 00:06:15.659]  It was 10 years ago or so, a well-known sculptor sent us this sculpture of George Soros.
[00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:16.759]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it.
[00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.521]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to infowars.com forward slash show and find the feed.
[00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:27.444]  And it's just a plastic sculpture, but it's nice of George Soros with devil horns.
[00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:33.886]  And you can say, oh, well, that's just a facsimile of the devil, but it doesn't really take you there of what a real devil he is.
[00:06:33.886 --> 00:06:34.767]  And, you know, we talk about
[00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.823]  George Soros, but he's just one of the top generals of this anti-human globalist system.
[00:06:39.823 --> 00:06:50.532]  But when I was reading about Oprah Winfrey and all the reports that have come out over the years of her, and not just being a lesbian, we're not judging her for that.
[00:06:50.532 --> 00:06:53.595]  Wouldn't want her to hide behind that.
[00:06:53.595 --> 00:06:55.677]  But her being into underage girls.
[00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:58.079]  Well then you have her hanging out with Harvey Weinstein, best friends with him.
[00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.700]  You have her hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.543]  You have her hanging out with Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:07:03.763 --> 00:07:08.448]  At Harvey Weinstein's and at Jeffrey Epstein's.
[00:07:08.448 --> 00:07:13.072]  And you have, now people are digging into all the weird speeches she's given.
[00:07:13.072 --> 00:07:16.515]  Hold on to your horses here, I'm gonna play it in a moment.
[00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:20.459]  With her saying, children enjoy being molested.
[00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:26.024]  You have to understand something.
[00:07:26.024 --> 00:07:28.687]  I was told by Ted Gunderson
[00:07:30.003 --> 00:07:34.006]  And others that she was a pedophile 20 years ago.
[00:07:34.006 --> 00:07:37.308]  And I'm like, we're not touching that because he'd say, can I go here?
[00:07:37.308 --> 00:07:38.229]  Can I go there?
[00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.171]  And I believe Ted Gunnarsson believe what he was saying, but I didn't know that he was a hundred percent right.
[00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:42.612]  Basically.
[00:07:42.612 --> 00:07:43.893]  I thought he might've been a little crazy.
[00:07:43.893 --> 00:07:45.814]  Turned out the guy was completely on it.
[00:07:45.814 --> 00:07:47.575]  He'd be like, and then there's this, and then there's that.
[00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:52.679]  And when you're really telling people about something like this, and you've got 50 years of knowledge, that's how you behave.
[00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:53.059]  If you care.
[00:07:54.428 --> 00:07:58.189]  It's like the end of Body Snatchers, you know, it's a fictional account, but he's like, we're in danger!
[00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.649]  There's aliens!
[00:07:58.649 --> 00:07:59.510]  They're taking over!
[00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.230]  Get the military!
[00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.610]  Stop them!
[00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.770]  I mean, that's how you act.
[00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:15.055]  There have been famous cases where somebody's doing electrical wiring or whatever in a house and a wall slides back and there's four or five dead bodies in there and the person panics and runs out and calls the police and is hyperventilating.
[00:08:15.055 --> 00:08:17.196]  I mean, that's a real way to behave.
[00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:20.957]  I remember David Icke.
[00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:33.229]  On my show 20 plus years ago saying the BBC is run by pedophiles and this particular prime minister would put out plastic every week and they bring in a little girl and they slit her throat.
[00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:38.853]  And man, more than 15 years later, it came out mainstream news that they were doing that.
[00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:41.715]  And Jimmy Savelle would deliver the little girls.
[00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:43.176]  And they'd have sex with the dead bodies.
[00:08:43.176 --> 00:08:48.000]  I mean, this is all confirmed.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.663]  So we can sit here with George Soros as a facsimile of the devil.
[00:08:53.353 --> 00:08:56.975]  But he's just one of a whole group of these guys.
[00:08:56.975 --> 00:09:02.177]  Now I've never been told by anybody that Soros himself has sex with children.
[00:09:02.177 --> 00:09:05.738]  But the word is Oprah Winfrey does.
[00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:11.361]  And now is the season to talk about all this because when I show you these Oprah Winfrey documents here in a moment.
[00:09:13.558 --> 00:09:28.511]  You have to understand, she's at the Epstein elitist eugenics meetings in the Wall Street Journal, in the New York Times, in the Washington Post, ABC News, calling her a hero for this group that wants world government and to depopulate us.
[00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:35.978]  These are quotes.
[00:09:35.978 --> 00:09:39.561]  And she's in there on the board of the secret group.
[00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:43.722]  So she's not just some token black lady they got.
[00:09:43.722 --> 00:09:45.442]  She likes it.
[00:09:45.442 --> 00:09:52.123]  And she'll tell you in a moment, children like to be sexually abused, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:52.123 --> 00:09:52.663]  Well, I don't know.
[00:09:52.663 --> 00:09:53.543]  I was a grown man.
[00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:57.944]  The few times Hollywood producers grabbed me by the genitals, I threatened to kick their ass.
[00:09:57.944 --> 00:10:00.265]  I didn't enjoy it.
[00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:02.665]  And I don't count myself as a victim, but I was about three years old.
[00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:06.766]  So my earliest memories, there was a babysitter, a local teenager.
[00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:13.514]  Teenage boy, and he began to try to molest me, and I did not enjoy it, I will tell you.
[00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:18.057]  And I told my dad, I got him off of me, I told my dad about it, and my dad went and dealt with it.
[00:10:18.057 --> 00:10:19.678]  That's not enjoyable.
[00:10:19.678 --> 00:10:20.559]  It was not fun.
[00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:22.180]  Didn't like it.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.522]  So, Oprah Winfrey is a sick monster.
[00:10:26.522 --> 00:10:29.564]  And it's time that she be exposed for who she is.
[00:10:29.564 --> 00:10:33.807]  That's why Trump said a few years ago, talking about her running against him, he said, oh, she's got a lot of problems.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.862]  Just like he said, you know, Jeffrey Epstein, and that's a pervert island.
[00:10:37.862 --> 00:10:39.843]  They're a bunch of filth.
[00:10:39.843 --> 00:10:42.484]  That's who these people are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:42.484 --> 00:10:43.985]  So Gregory's tweeted this out.
[00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:46.066]  Oprah Winfrey on child molestation.
[00:10:46.066 --> 00:10:51.670]  I have said for years, if the abuser is any good, then you won't even know it happened.
[00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.192]  Just like COVID-19, just like the mass, just like the inoculations.
[00:10:55.192 --> 00:10:59.114]  They inject you and it kills you 10 years later.
[00:10:59.114 --> 00:11:02.256]  That's their whole methodology of the spider.
[00:11:02.256 --> 00:11:04.377]  It weaves its web and you never know what hit you.
[00:11:07.168 --> 00:11:16.473]  And then we're going to get to General Flynn's emergency warning and talk about the plan before the election to remove Trump by force that they're now pushing.
[00:11:16.473 --> 00:11:34.564]  But Greg Reese is uploading the raw video we're about to play with an augmented video that shows backups and clips and a voiceover to Band.Video with the title, Children Enjoy Being Molested, Oprah Winfrey.
[00:11:34.564 --> 00:11:35.585]  But don't listen to me.
[00:11:36.826 --> 00:11:40.808]  Hear it from her own sick, filthy mouth.
[00:11:40.808 --> 00:11:46.851]  Here it is.
[00:11:46.851 --> 00:11:52.134]  In 2019, Oprah Winfrey had a special with child abuse victims of Michael Jackson.
[00:11:52.134 --> 00:11:56.776]  She went on to explain that when done right, child abuse feels good.
[00:11:57.256 --> 00:11:59.058]  So this is what so many people don't understand.
[00:11:59.058 --> 00:12:08.687]  A big part of the confusion and shame for child victims is that the attention and the seduction from the predator who is probably gonna be somebody you know.
[00:12:10.657 --> 00:12:19.620]  In order for it to work, it has to be somebody you know, somebody you admire, somebody you respect, or maybe even love.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.400]  And it feels good.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:31.964]  I mean, if you're seven years old and somebody, which I was trying to say this to my friends who had children, you're seven years old and someone is stroking your penis, it feels good.
[00:12:33.184 --> 00:12:37.626]  Even though you don't have a name for what that is, it feels good.
[00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:45.969]  And when I first said this years ago, people were like, you're crazy because everybody wants to believe it's like sexual assault and you're being thrown up against the wall and you're being raped.
[00:12:45.969 --> 00:12:49.511]  And I have said for years, if the abuser is any good,
[00:12:51.114 --> 00:12:52.636]  You won't even know it's happened.
[00:12:52.636 --> 00:12:56.119]  You will be in it and you won't even know it's happened.
[00:12:56.119 --> 00:13:02.724]  And if the abuser is any good, he or she is going to make you feel like you're a part of it.
[00:13:02.724 --> 00:13:07.028]  I mean, and nothing is more being a part of it than what we discussed earlier.
[00:13:07.028 --> 00:13:09.690]  You say you were married.
[00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.092]  You had marriage vows and you have rings.
[00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:12.272]  Right.
[00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:27.291]  Oprah legitimized the notorious sex criminal Joe Tashira, aka John of God, as a miraculous faith healer, one who could cure cancer, giving him international recognition.
[00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:32.113]  Joe Tashira is now serving 19 years in prison for the rape of four women.
[00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:52.244]  He is facing additional cases related to several sex crimes, including keeping teenage women as sex slaves in underground mines, forcing them to have his children, and selling their babies internationally for tens of thousands of dollars before murdering the women after about 10 years of childbirth.
[00:13:53.337 --> 00:14:09.867]  Oprah runs her own Leadership Academy for Girls in Africa, a $40 million school for disadvantaged girls, where in 2007, several children were sexually abused and parents were only allowed to see their children once a month.
[00:14:09.867 --> 00:14:13.430]  And I have said for years, if the abuser is any good,
[00:14:15.029 --> 00:14:16.671]  You won't even know it's happened.
[00:14:16.671 --> 00:14:22.279]  Oprah was very close with disgraced Hollywood mogul, rapist and abuser Harvey Weinstein.
[00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:26.985]  Her Me Too documentary ignored Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:14:28.286 --> 00:14:31.567]  Oprah was herself a teenage prostitute.
[00:14:31.567 --> 00:14:35.369]  She stokes the fires of racism in America.
[00:14:35.369 --> 00:14:39.951]  And she is a member of the Billionaire Club, or the Good Club.
[00:14:39.951 --> 00:14:53.117]  Along with Bill Gates, George Soros, Warren Buffet, David Rockefeller, and Ted Turner, the so-called Good Club meets behind closed doors and discusses plans for global depopulation.
[00:14:53.117 --> 00:14:54.738]  The Great Awakening is upon us.
[00:14:55.538 --> 00:15:01.962]  When will humanity begin seeing these billionaire celebrities for who they really are?
[00:15:01.962 --> 00:15:07.086]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:15:07.086 --> 00:15:13.751]  Now the other question is, when are people going to start doing something else?
[00:15:13.751 --> 00:15:24.478]  So we build up these Hollywood people, they could be black, they could be white as these idols, but they've been chosen by the powerful corrupt that Christ told us are run by Satan, the God of this world.
[00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:28.067]  To do anything they're told.
[00:15:28.067 --> 00:15:32.429]  Well, if you'll abuse little kids, you'll do anything.
[00:15:32.429 --> 00:15:44.016]  And there is a real hunger for poor children out of Eastern Europe and poor children out of the Caribbean and poor children out of Eastern Asia and out of Africa.
[00:15:44.016 --> 00:15:55.623]  Remember, it's come out and it's confirmed that out of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Jeffrey Epstein purchased more than 15 years ago,
[00:15:58.129 --> 00:16:05.714]  An 11-year-old girl who he then raped and trained to recruit other girls.
[00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:08.116]  And that's what Oprah Winfrey did.
[00:16:08.116 --> 00:16:10.498]  Oprah Winfrey was a child prostitute.
[00:16:10.498 --> 00:16:21.085]  And many people that end up being abused sexually become the procurers of children for the Draculas.
[00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:24.487]  The Prince Charleses.
[00:16:24.487 --> 00:16:25.188]  The Bill Clintons.
[00:16:26.158 --> 00:16:31.541]  And I've told you, Winfrey likes the girls, but she's a Renfield.
[00:16:31.541 --> 00:16:53.113]  She procures the children and is a servant to these people, just like George Soros, when he was 14, 15, and 16, for three years in Eastern Europe, helped round up and find where Jews were hiding.
[00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:55.154]  And after he did that, and worked for the Nazis,
[00:16:56.493 --> 00:17:00.994]  Well, he got picked up by OSS after that, and the rest is history as a deep state agent.
[00:17:00.994 --> 00:17:10.715]  Because, if you'll round up your own people and kill them, and if you'll abuse children, you'll do anything.
[00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:13.776]  It's like Xi Jinping.
[00:17:13.776 --> 00:17:24.018]  The Mal Youth Brigades brutally tortured his sister to death in front of him, and he helped them, reportedly.
[00:17:24.018 --> 00:17:25.078]  His father didn't like it.
[00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.691]  GG Ping denounced him, he was sent for 10 years of forced labor.
[00:17:28.691 --> 00:17:35.174]  When his father came back, he marched in the street, they threw things at him and spit on him, and GG Ping did as well.
[00:17:35.174 --> 00:17:42.096]  You can put a gun to my head and say, spit on your father, denounce your father, pull the trigger.
[00:17:42.096 --> 00:17:42.797]  I'm not doing it.
[00:17:42.797 --> 00:17:46.198]  And that's not special, that's called having a will and a soul.
[00:17:47.987 --> 00:17:58.934]  And you could put a gun to my head and say, have sex with a 10-year-old boy or girl, and I would say, I'm going to take that gun out of your hand and shove it up your ass and pull the trigger.
[00:17:58.934 --> 00:18:06.059]  Everything you see the globalists doing now is being done because they're losing control and there's a global awakening.
[00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:17.126]  Trump signed that executive order on human trafficking to tenfold increase the actions internationally and nationally, and has put Navy ships in the Mediterranean,
[00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:27.628]  The Caribbean, the Atlantic, and the Pacific, around Europe's borders and our borders, to stop these ships smuggling children.
[00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:35.895]  Because on all these migrant Soros-funded ships coming across, they have a cargo of little boys and girls who are not with their parents.
[00:18:35.895 --> 00:18:37.877]  The cargos are always the same.
[00:18:37.877 --> 00:18:41.981]  About 90% male, military age, a couple token women,
[00:18:43.066 --> 00:18:43.626]  We're good to go.
[00:19:03.646 --> 00:19:11.169]  Having them breed children, and after they had on average 10 children, or if their womb goes out, murdering them.
[00:19:11.169 --> 00:19:15.631]  Women kept like milk cows.
[00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:19.992]  Their children taken like eggs from a hen.
[00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:27.855]  And now all over the UK, as these ships arrive, the police are arresting anyone that shows the men and children being offloaded.
[00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:31.617]  They threatened to arrest Nigel Farage, who could have been the British Prime Minister.
[00:19:35.034 --> 00:19:38.838]  And now Boris Johnson is going along with what Tony Blair started.
[00:19:38.838 --> 00:19:40.060]  All of this.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:49.670]  An unlimited, insatiable desire, not just for children they trade, like baseball cards, for sex.
[00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.732]  They kill them.
[00:19:52.523 --> 00:20:00.126]  The Renfields, the servants, were abused as children, so their love, they believe, sexually is with another child.
[00:20:00.126 --> 00:20:06.368]  That's what they know, and they see the child as them, and so they're very childlike, but also demonic and evil.
[00:20:06.368 --> 00:20:08.689]  They have multiple personalities, generally.
[00:20:08.689 --> 00:20:20.633]  But the John of Gods, the Bill Clintons, the Hillary Clintons, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, at that level, they torture these children to death.
[00:20:22.318 --> 00:20:35.271]  And just like every other satanic organization, they then feast on their pituitary glands and on their adrenal glands.
[00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:37.914]  And so it's all coming out.
[00:20:39.381 --> 00:20:57.743]  Oprah Winfrey is in power and was put in power to create racial division and division between the sexes and the destruction of the family because she's been a sex MK ultra type sex slave from the time she was six years old in her own words.
[00:20:57.743 --> 00:20:59.124]  And what do most of those people do?
[00:21:00.239 --> 00:21:15.812]  They embrace it, just like Tony Podesta in the Washington Post did a full spread article about, I've got DeviantArt little kids, and I've got a theater in a dungeon, and we watch it, and we love it, and we're going to do it more.
[00:21:15.812 --> 00:21:18.674]  Because it's about being in your face.
[00:21:18.674 --> 00:21:19.435]  The Catholic Church.
[00:21:20.794 --> 00:21:27.138]  If you want to understand how these sickos behave, and how these delusional, selfish people operate, and why Antifa and all of them are burning Bibles,
[00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:58.939]  And sacrificing animals in front of police stations, it's because we've not stood up to them.
[00:21:58.939 --> 00:22:04.940]  We've not told these devils, to hell with you.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:11.221]  We're not bowing down to your political correctness and you telling us we're not moral because we don't follow your edicts.
[00:22:11.221 --> 00:22:14.862]  They laugh at us that they say they're the moral ones and they give us the orders.
[00:22:17.517 --> 00:22:24.843]  They're a joke and their followers are the stupidest, most pathetic, sad people on the planet.
[00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:31.128]  Who are seeking after power because they don't have any innate power.
[00:22:31.128 --> 00:22:35.231]  Let me show you some of these.
[00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:36.572]  Oprah Winfrey articles right here.
[00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:42.775]  Oprah Winfrey on child molestation.
[00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:51.318]  Guys, download the actual raw footage, because I told Greg to put that report out with added stuff, and that's great, but I want to show it raw without any music in a moment.
[00:22:51.318 --> 00:22:53.079]  Oprah Winfrey on child molestation.
[00:22:53.079 --> 00:22:57.361]  I have said for years, if the abuser is any good, then you won't even know what happened.
[00:22:57.361 --> 00:23:00.822]  I could spend the whole show on that statement, I will.
[00:23:00.822 --> 00:23:02.843]  I'll get to it in a moment.
[00:23:02.843 --> 00:23:08.505]  But she said even more.
[00:23:08.505 --> 00:23:09.446]  She went even further.
[00:23:09.446 --> 00:23:09.926]  She said,
[00:23:11.044 --> 00:23:17.669]  It's usually people close to them, people they love, and they enjoy it.
[00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:23.294]  And she's there obviously getting off, talking to these former sex slaves, while she talks about it.
[00:23:23.294 --> 00:23:26.276]  This is disgusting.
[00:23:26.276 --> 00:23:30.259]  And this is as evil as it gets.
[00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:36.885]  And you look at her whole history, and then she's in the secret world government cult.
[00:23:36.885 --> 00:23:38.686]  The good guy group.
[00:23:38.686 --> 00:23:39.387]  What a sick joke.
[00:23:40.757 --> 00:23:45.160]  With Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein and the rest of the same people.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:50.023]  Because if you think having sex with children is the bottom of the pit, you know nothing.
[00:23:50.023 --> 00:23:53.105]  If you think even killing individual children is the bottom of the pit, you know nothing.
[00:23:53.105 --> 00:24:04.413]  It's about raping our genetics, our genetic code, cutting us off from God, and engaging in absolute carnage and destruction, vandalism against God's creation.
[00:24:06.192 --> 00:24:07.393]  So here's some of the articles.
[00:24:07.393 --> 00:24:10.434]  Lockdowns killed two people for every three that died of coronavirus.
[00:24:10.434 --> 00:24:11.695]  And that's a fraud too.
[00:24:11.695 --> 00:24:13.416]  But look, here's a new video out.
[00:24:13.416 --> 00:24:17.878]  Bill Maher says it's possible horny Clinton was on Epstein Island.
[00:24:17.878 --> 00:24:19.359]  Oh, he was just horny.
[00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:20.299]  They have all the witnesses.
[00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:21.940]  They have all the people, underage girls.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.741]  That was just the beginning.
[00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:31.965]  They would pull in during these parties with children kidnapped in the Caribbean who'd never be seen again.
[00:24:38.587 --> 00:24:45.509]  To a devil worshipper, the pleasure of coming into a dungeon with a little kid strapped up crying, totally scared.
[00:24:45.509 --> 00:24:52.511]  And the psychos describe it, in his mainline psychopaths, of using them up and then the light goes out of their eyes and they believe they drink it in.
[00:24:52.511 --> 00:24:57.553]  Can you imagine the last thing you see is Bill Clinton raping you while he slits your throat?
[00:24:59.105 --> 00:25:02.947]  NYC illegally placed pedophiles near Upper West Side Playground.
[00:25:02.947 --> 00:25:03.887]  They always do.
[00:25:03.887 --> 00:25:06.669]  Hell, the German government placed thousands of children with pedophiles.
[00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:10.971]  They said it's the truest form of love to create a new form of love outside the family.
[00:25:10.971 --> 00:25:17.234]  Children will be taken from Christians and given to convicted pedophiles who will teach them the love of sex.
[00:25:17.234 --> 00:25:19.935]  Just like Oprah said, they love it.
[00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:21.476]  They enjoy it.
[00:25:21.476 --> 00:25:22.877]  And they're externalizing the method.
[00:25:24.881 --> 00:25:28.545]  Mariah Carey's sister says there's upstate satanic coven.
[00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:29.646]  She's taking the police there.
[00:25:29.646 --> 00:25:33.510]  Other children admit that that's true, but they won't get into it.
[00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.273]  Rich, powerful men, little girls taken there at 2 a.m.
[00:25:36.273 --> 00:25:39.397]  to be raped.
[00:25:39.397 --> 00:25:41.118]  They're called the Good Club though.
[00:25:41.118 --> 00:25:41.839]  London Guardian.
[00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:42.960]  And they want to save the world.
[00:25:44.011 --> 00:25:47.013]  By depopulating the planet, especially Africa.
[00:25:47.013 --> 00:25:48.635]  The names of the members are familiar figures.
[00:25:48.635 --> 00:25:52.498]  Bill Gates, George Soros, Warren Buffett, Oprah Winfrey, David Rockefeller, Ted Turner.
[00:25:52.498 --> 00:25:55.500]  But there are others too, like business giants.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.942]  Eli and Edith Broad.
[00:25:57.942 --> 00:25:59.764]  Greekly wealthy, but less known.
[00:25:59.764 --> 00:26:01.605]  And it goes into their alternate world government.
[00:26:01.605 --> 00:26:02.706]  They say world government.
[00:26:02.706 --> 00:26:04.347]  The African youth boom.
[00:26:04.347 --> 00:26:05.768]  What's worrying Bill Gates?
[00:26:05.768 --> 00:26:07.570]  Oh, he wants to kill you, but oh, he loves you.
[00:26:09.189 --> 00:26:10.990]  Billionaires try to sink world population.
[00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.091]  Report says.
[00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:13.192]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:13.192 --> 00:26:15.654]  You can read all about Oprah Winfrey.
[00:26:15.654 --> 00:26:23.740]  How she has big orphanages all across Africa to help little girls.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.483]  Just like John of God helps some billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation.
[00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:30.825]  The Times of the UK.
[00:26:30.825 --> 00:26:32.526]  Oh, Oprah Winfrey.
[00:26:32.526 --> 00:26:33.947]  Michael Bloomberg.
[00:26:33.947 --> 00:26:34.968]  George Soros.
[00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:35.729]  Ted Turner.
[00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:42.903]  Oh, they're good.
[00:26:42.903 --> 00:26:44.884]  They want to save you.
[00:26:44.884 --> 00:26:48.285]  Billionaires try to shrink world population, report says.
[00:26:48.285 --> 00:26:49.146]  Who's involved?
[00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:50.246]  Oprah Winfrey.
[00:26:50.246 --> 00:26:59.190]  And they've got orphanages to help the children while they prep for the apocalypse.
[00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.831]  So let's hear before I get into General Flynn.
[00:27:01.618 --> 00:27:05.260]  And the coup attempt against America and how serious things are with 86 days out.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:10.144]  Because believe me, I was out by the pool with my kids and I got friends inviting me out on their boat.
[00:27:10.144 --> 00:27:13.386]  And I'm sitting there this morning and the crew saying, are you doing a show?
[00:27:13.386 --> 00:27:14.227]  And I said, absolutely.
[00:27:14.227 --> 00:27:15.407]  I got to do it.
[00:27:15.407 --> 00:27:24.293]  Because Gregory sent me this clip of Oprah Winfrey and I'd forgotten she did all these shows about abused kids and people would say, man, she really gets into this.
[00:27:24.293 --> 00:27:26.595]  And I was always thinking about Ted Gunnarsson, Ted Gunnarsson.
[00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:38.673]  And then she's part of a group that wants to depopulate you, but she loves the children so much, and she herself is a child sex abuse victim.
[00:27:38.673 --> 00:27:40.553]  This is so evil.
[00:27:40.553 --> 00:27:44.034]  Here she is talking about children enjoy being molested.
[00:27:44.034 --> 00:27:45.594]  Here it is.
[00:27:45.594 --> 00:27:47.395]  So this is what so many people don't understand.
[00:27:47.395 --> 00:27:57.357]  A big part of the confusion and shame for child victims is that the attention and the seduction from the predator, who is probably going to be somebody you know.
[00:27:57.357 --> 00:27:57.817]  The predator?
[00:27:57.817 --> 00:27:58.477]  Right.
[00:27:58.996 --> 00:28:07.938]  In order for it to work, it has to be somebody you know, somebody you admire, somebody you respect, or maybe even love.
[00:28:07.938 --> 00:28:09.738]  And it feels good.
[00:28:09.738 --> 00:28:11.179]  I mean... Really?
[00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:20.621]  If you're seven years old and somebody, which I was trying to say this to my friends who had children, you're seven years old and someone is stroking your penis, it feels good.
[00:28:20.621 --> 00:28:21.521]  No, it doesn't.
[00:28:21.521 --> 00:28:25.402]  Even though you don't have a name for what that is, it feels good.
[00:28:25.962 --> 00:28:34.308]  And when I first said this years ago, people were like, you're crazy because everybody wants to believe it's like sexual assault and you're being thrown up against the wall and you're being raped.
[00:28:34.308 --> 00:28:37.851]  And I have said for years, if the abuser is any good,
[00:28:39.459 --> 00:28:40.980]  You won't even know it's happened.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.442]  You will be in it and you won't even know it's happened.
[00:28:44.442 --> 00:28:51.065]  And if the abuser is any good, he or she is going to make you feel like you're a part of it.
[00:28:51.065 --> 00:28:55.347]  I mean, and nothing is more being a part of it than what we discussed earlier.
[00:28:55.347 --> 00:28:58.009]  You say you were married.
[00:28:58.009 --> 00:29:00.430]  You had marriage vows and you have rings.
[00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.631]  Right.
[00:29:01.631 --> 00:29:05.613]  You can analyze that minute and a half clip for a hundred years.
[00:29:05.613 --> 00:29:08.034]  It's a skeleton key or Rosetta Stone to everything.
[00:29:10.731 --> 00:29:11.852]  The good ones do it to you.
[00:29:11.852 --> 00:29:12.733]  You don't know what happened.
[00:29:12.733 --> 00:29:15.135]  They include you in it.
[00:29:15.135 --> 00:29:16.336]  They tell you you're not killing a baby.
[00:29:16.336 --> 00:29:17.376]  You go out and kill your baby.
[00:29:17.376 --> 00:29:19.358]  Now you've killed your baby with abortion.
[00:29:19.358 --> 00:29:21.320]  They get you to wear a mask, go along with the fraud.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.240]  Now you're wearing it every day.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.261]  Now you're part of it.
[00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:24.722]  Now you're enforcing it on others.
[00:29:24.722 --> 00:29:27.445]  They're abusing you knowing it's all a fraud.
[00:29:27.445 --> 00:29:37.493]  Everything they do is about including you and your family and your culture in their evil so that you are aiding and abetting their whole operation.
[00:29:38.507 --> 00:29:43.369]  And that's why Governor Northam comes out and says we keep babies alive and we keep their organs and we kill them.
[00:29:43.369 --> 00:29:49.172]  But we decide they're not alive in a ritual and say that the mother doesn't want it so we do not resuscitate.
[00:29:49.172 --> 00:29:51.933]  That means it's going to be killed and they sign a death warrant.
[00:29:51.933 --> 00:29:55.495]  It doesn't mean that it was dead and they didn't save it.
[00:29:55.495 --> 00:29:56.935]  It's all ritual.
[00:29:56.935 --> 00:30:00.577]  We decide this child does not live under bioethics.
[00:30:00.577 --> 00:30:02.118]  We decide it doesn't have a future.
[00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:04.945]  That's what the bioethicists just say.
[00:30:04.945 --> 00:30:06.646]  They say, we'll decide the value.
[00:30:06.646 --> 00:30:12.387]  Peter Singer, former head of PETA, basically the founder of it, he said, we're going to kill children up to age three.
[00:30:12.387 --> 00:30:18.469]  And we'll kill down children anytime we want.
[00:30:18.469 --> 00:30:19.950]  And they said, the police aren't involved.
[00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:20.910]  What did Governor Northam say?
[00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.831]  He said, the police not involved.
[00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:27.492]  The mother involved with maybe one doctor, maybe two.
[00:30:28.476 --> 00:30:31.259]  And we don't get the government involved.
[00:30:31.259 --> 00:30:33.220]  It's a decision we make.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.743]  Resuscitate, baby, not resuscitate.
[00:30:35.743 --> 00:30:44.010]  And then if she don't resuscitate, we keep her comfortable and we take the organ.
[00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.693]  And there's the women sitting there looking at him, not even knowing what they're hearing.
[00:30:46.693 --> 00:30:48.695]  They're going, what?
[00:30:48.695 --> 00:30:49.455]  No, no.
[00:30:49.455 --> 00:30:50.977]  Police not involved.
[00:31:01.072 --> 00:31:02.073]  That's who these people are.
[00:31:02.073 --> 00:31:04.335]  They're teaching you not to stand up for yourself.
[00:31:04.335 --> 00:31:11.941]  And if you won't stand up for the unborn and the born and the old, nobody's going to stand up for you.
[00:31:11.941 --> 00:31:14.283]  Oh, but the ultimate crime is standing up to a globalist.
[00:31:14.283 --> 00:31:21.469]  Oh, then their lives are very valuable.
[00:31:21.469 --> 00:31:26.694]  You know, what if we say Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama,
[00:31:28.422 --> 00:31:30.023]  The whole Rockefeller clan, all of them.
[00:31:30.023 --> 00:31:32.543]  What if we said you're not essential?
[00:31:32.543 --> 00:31:35.084]  You know, the mayor of Austin says the police department's not essential.
[00:31:35.084 --> 00:31:36.625]  Hey, how about you're not essential?
[00:31:36.625 --> 00:31:40.366]  How about your city council that put in its budget to blow up the police department?
[00:31:40.366 --> 00:31:41.646]  Folks, if you're a new viewer, I'm not joking.
[00:31:41.646 --> 00:31:42.427]  I know that sounds crazy.
[00:31:42.427 --> 00:31:43.607]  It's real.
[00:31:43.607 --> 00:31:45.408]  What if we put in the budget to blow up the city council?
[00:31:45.408 --> 00:31:49.689]  Because let me tell you, that's definitely a non-essential group.
[00:31:58.902 --> 00:31:59.142]  All right.
[00:31:59.142 --> 00:32:11.012]  It's Saturday, ladies and gentlemen, and, uh, I'm going to air a little four minute report that, uh, Owen Schroer put together.
[00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:16.156]  And then I'm going to come back into General Flynn's emergency letter to the country.
[00:32:16.156 --> 00:32:16.997]  That's on Infowars.com.
[00:32:16.997 --> 00:32:18.618]  Then I'll have the rest of the news.
[00:32:18.618 --> 00:32:21.961]  Let me just say this right now.
[00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:26.805]  At one level watching Owen's piece, it's cheesy and it's stupid.
[00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:36.490]  Because there he is, really sad that he is burning LeBron James' jerseys that he owns.
[00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.951]  And you're like, who cares about basketball?
[00:32:37.951 --> 00:32:39.832]  Who cares about that?
[00:32:39.832 --> 00:32:45.735]  But at least sports was a celebration of humans and humans doing well and competing.
[00:32:45.735 --> 00:32:47.956]  The Globalists want to get rid of human competition.
[00:32:47.956 --> 00:32:51.017]  So they banned dodgeball, they're trying to ban contact sports.
[00:32:51.017 --> 00:32:52.558]  And so the fact that we do celebrate
[00:32:53.553 --> 00:33:01.139]  Major sports stars, Hollywood, whatever, as long as we're celebrating that people are God-made and that it's fun what we do, it's a healthy thing.
[00:33:01.139 --> 00:33:06.863]  But when the LeBron Jameses or the Arnold Schwarzeneggers or whoever you're liking to watch
[00:33:07.995 --> 00:33:11.616]  Cause they're entertaining or whatever, or you like the action and the competition.
[00:33:11.616 --> 00:33:25.522]  When they sign on to Chinese slave camps or global carbon taxes that kill the third world, they use that humanity against humanity and they need to be absolutely reviled.
[00:33:25.522 --> 00:33:29.043]  And so I see Owen.
[00:33:29.043 --> 00:33:34.186]  Sad when he's burning with Ron James jerseys, cause he plays basketball almost every day, like, you know, six, 7 a.m.
[00:33:34.186 --> 00:33:34.566]  in the morning.
[00:33:34.566 --> 00:33:36.546]  And he used to be a sports broadcaster.
[00:33:36.546 --> 00:33:37.147]  He's into it.
[00:33:37.147 --> 00:33:37.627]  And I get it.
[00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:46.569]  But I guarantee you, six months from now, once he turns off basketball for good, he'll still play basketball.
[00:33:46.569 --> 00:33:47.390]  He'll still have fun.
[00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:48.510]  It's still good with him and his friends.
[00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.511]  In fact, it's going to be better.
[00:33:50.511 --> 00:34:05.220]  Instead of letting some big corporation that sold us out to China, that supports millions in death camps, capturing our sports that we play, and then making it about the people that are the very best at it at some professional level, instead of making it about what we do locally.
[00:34:06.786 --> 00:34:12.671]  And I'm all for human competition, but we should have local golf tournaments and local basketball tournaments.
[00:34:12.671 --> 00:34:16.574]  I remember as a kid growing up in Dallas, I went to basketball games and football games and all that.
[00:34:16.574 --> 00:34:17.455]  My parents were into sports.
[00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:18.236]  I was into it too.
[00:34:18.236 --> 00:34:22.600]  But I remember going down and seeing when they would have these just street competitions.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.042]  I forget the name of it in Dallas for the weekend.
[00:34:25.042 --> 00:34:27.604]  Everybody was actually just playing basketball themselves, regular folks.
[00:34:27.604 --> 00:34:30.627]  That was way more fun and seeing who would advance.
[00:34:30.627 --> 00:34:33.029]  We'd go eat dinner, come back out, see who would advance.
[00:34:33.029 --> 00:34:35.371]  That was way better than going to an NBA game.
[00:34:36.459 --> 00:34:38.060]  Because it's all plastic, it's all fake.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:43.882]  And we have to remember, it's all controlled now to cover up the pedophilia, to cover up the world government.
[00:34:43.882 --> 00:34:49.825]  So when you see an arrogant LeBron James strutting around saying screw Trump, screw America, I don't care.
[00:34:49.825 --> 00:34:52.807]  I'm going to say America sucks and our police suck.
[00:34:52.807 --> 00:34:57.769]  Okay, cops kill on average 14 innocent black men a year where it looks like it was done wrong.
[00:34:59.002 --> 00:35:02.623]  They got millions of people in death camps, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims.
[00:35:02.623 --> 00:35:05.064]  I mean, the worst of it, oh, LeBron James doesn't give a damn about it.
[00:35:05.064 --> 00:35:06.004]  It's all a fraud.
[00:35:06.004 --> 00:35:14.407]  He doesn't care about anybody, including himself, because if he really cared about himself, he'd have empathy and he'd care about other people.
[00:35:14.407 --> 00:35:26.370]  So with all the crimes going on, it kind of feels petty to even play LeBron James, and I'm not putting Owen down, pointing out that, you know, he's sad he's having to burn LeBron James' jersey.
[00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.051]  But I'll tell you, our whole future
[00:35:29.016 --> 00:35:36.166]  And everything's gonna burn if we don't start not just not watching people, but hating them.
[00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:38.870]  And I hate LeBron James.
[00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.472]  And I hate these NFL players.
[00:35:40.472 --> 00:35:41.774]  I don't care what color they are.
[00:35:41.774 --> 00:35:42.195]  I hate them.
[00:35:43.527 --> 00:35:55.150]  Because they're bought and paid for by huge, powerful interests, and they make 10, 20 million dollars a year, and they sit there and complain about a country that's one of the only hopes we've got to turn this around, and it's pathetic.
[00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:59.152]  And if things go down, we're going to lose everything, and they already think America's done.
[00:35:59.152 --> 00:36:00.332]  They already think it's over.
[00:36:00.332 --> 00:36:03.253]  They want to move to China.
[00:36:03.253 --> 00:36:07.234]  And the NBA leadership talks like that, and it shows how sick they are.
[00:36:08.234 --> 00:36:19.260]  They don't appreciate their roots, they don't appreciate where they came from, and they're too dumb to know that once America's gone, the Communist Chinese can muscle in on whoever they want, and then you won't be paid anything!
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.423]  But it's a fight between good and evil.
[00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:33.849]  And when I see a Colin Kaepernick, paid by Nike to cover up its slave labor in China, who never said he was black, white parents,
[00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:41.214]  Hired by an evil corporation to use black people as a shield, as a front to cover up the evil they're doing.
[00:36:41.214 --> 00:36:42.715]  It's disgusting.
[00:36:42.715 --> 00:36:46.517]  You understand these people are conscious about what they're doing.
[00:36:46.517 --> 00:36:53.322]  You'll never hear Colin Kaepernick or LeBron James talk about how 22 million black people got aborted.
[00:36:53.322 --> 00:36:55.703]  And another 40 million other people.
[00:36:55.703 --> 00:36:58.785]  But you will hear Kanye West.
[00:36:58.785 --> 00:37:01.327]  You'll see Kanye West crying and real.
[00:37:01.327 --> 00:37:04.609]  And you can look at Kanye West crying up there and real.
[00:37:06.229 --> 00:37:19.780]  Finally doing the right thing and fulfilled, and you can look at these big, arrogant, narcissistic, sociopathic, satanists like LeBron James, and I thank my lucky stars every day that I'm not LeBron James.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.502]  That I'm not Harvey Weinstein.
[00:37:22.502 --> 00:37:24.043]  That I am not Bill Clinton.
[00:37:24.043 --> 00:37:27.406]  These people are empty sacks of garbage.
[00:37:27.406 --> 00:37:29.928]  And it's well known Bill Clinton was sexually abused as a child as well.
[00:37:34.281 --> 00:37:43.264]  And in their sick, selfish worlds, they like to have sex with kids.
[00:37:43.264 --> 00:37:45.345]  And the whole house of cards is coming down.
[00:37:45.345 --> 00:37:52.487]  And so Hollywood and the New World Order and all your systems better know this, you're coming down.
[00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:55.917]  But it's going to be an explosive fight and it's going to be crazy.
[00:37:55.917 --> 00:37:57.258]  Now, I've got News Blitz.
[00:37:57.258 --> 00:37:59.419]  I've got this General Flynn letter I'm going to read.
[00:37:59.419 --> 00:38:00.900]  I've got the attempted coup against the President.
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.601]  I've got it all coming up.
[00:38:01.601 --> 00:38:08.026]  But I'm going to ask viewers and listeners right now at 2.37 Central Texas time, we're live.
[00:38:08.026 --> 00:38:11.008]  In an hour and a half, we won't be live in a loop until 4 p.m.
[00:38:11.008 --> 00:38:13.169]  tomorrow when I do the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:38:13.169 --> 00:38:13.350]  live.
[00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.432]  But I'm going to tell you, we're an inch away.
[00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:28.649]  From the whole house of satanic cards coming down, and they know it's coming down, so they want to create a global war, a global financial collapse, a global race war, total division, as a smokescreen.
[00:38:28.649 --> 00:38:37.538]  They've done all this, the COVID hoax, all of it as a smokescreen, and the sooner they get openly routed and defeated, which we're just an inch away from,
[00:38:38.865 --> 00:38:41.026]  Hell, by next week it may be a half an inch.
[00:38:41.026 --> 00:38:42.547]  They push back, we're back to an inch.
[00:38:42.547 --> 00:38:43.528]  It's how hard you push.
[00:38:43.528 --> 00:38:50.632]  We're right there to the end, where we're exhausted, and we're pissed, and we're tired, and we've been doing it so long, we just think, oh, the hell with it.
[00:38:50.632 --> 00:38:51.152]  No, no.
[00:38:51.152 --> 00:39:03.020]  Now's the time you gotta say, I'm really gonna get aggressive, I'm really gonna spread the word, I'm gonna really, I gotta fight, when it's getting down to like a fight's been going a couple minutes, and you're both tired, you're both bleeding, you just gotta go ahead and finish this person.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.822]  The analogy is you have to jump on top of and knock that head in the ground a couple times to make sure we win this fight.
[00:39:08.822 --> 00:39:16.506]  You got to reach down there and find those power cells you got and flip those switches and get aggressive about information.
[00:39:16.506 --> 00:39:25.290]  You need to storm your churches, storm live TV legally, storm the counties, the cities, the state houses, the bullhorn globalist houses.
[00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:31.113]  They shut everything down because they're scared of what we did with Bill Clinton's rapist four years ago when you hit them at their rallies.
[00:39:32.281 --> 00:39:35.483]  Go pay local airplanes.
[00:39:35.483 --> 00:39:37.164]  It's only like $1,000, $2,000.
[00:39:37.164 --> 00:39:40.006]  Fly around with a message behind it with a website on it.
[00:39:40.006 --> 00:39:42.568]  Just do something!
[00:39:42.568 --> 00:39:47.812]  And you don't know how that domino you knock over is going to hit those other dominoes, and you don't know whether you're going to get...
[00:39:49.102 --> 00:39:54.086]  A little hand, a big hand, or an ace of spades, or a royal flush.
[00:39:54.086 --> 00:39:55.667]  Or the dead man's hand.
[00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:57.409]  Or snake eyes again.
[00:39:57.409 --> 00:40:04.834]  But let me tell you, sitting on your ass, doing nothing, when you know all this, is going to bring us defeat.
[00:40:04.834 --> 00:40:06.856]  Action is going to bring victory.
[00:40:06.856 --> 00:40:08.978]  Resistance is going to bring victory.
[00:40:08.978 --> 00:40:10.639]  Fearlessness is going to bring victory.
[00:40:12.475 --> 00:40:23.463]  So I run my mouth in every gas station, every grocery store, on the street, every restaurant, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere!
[00:40:23.463 --> 00:40:27.967]  Because I'm not gonna just sit up here on air and think, well I've done what I did, that's enough!
[00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:28.567]  No!
[00:40:28.567 --> 00:40:34.512]  I don't know what little chain reaction I'm gonna hit that's gonna lead to the whole house of cards coming down!
[00:40:34.512 --> 00:40:37.234]  And I know in my life, man, I just keep pulling aces!
[00:40:39.284 --> 00:40:42.451]  Some of you don't pull aces because you never actually tried to pull a card.
[00:40:42.451 --> 00:40:43.733]  You got them.
[00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:45.777]  God gave them to you.
[00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:48.383]  And this is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:48.383 --> 00:40:49.385]  It's all coming down to it.
[00:40:51.806 --> 00:41:02.817]  And we can choose to do this the easy way or the hard way, because we're on the knife's edge, where we can fix this and have a future that's still going to be rough, but we're going to win, and God's going to fix it, and Christ is going to come back.
[00:41:02.817 --> 00:41:15.349]  But there's a couple other journeys that just get worse to worse to worse, where, I mean, we are choosing the future right now, and we better choose it correctly.
[00:41:17.284 --> 00:41:21.007]  And all of you out there that are scared to speak up, you better be scared of not speaking up.
[00:41:21.007 --> 00:41:22.869]  That's why people call in and say, man, you got a lot of courage.
[00:41:22.869 --> 00:41:25.911]  I got a lot of courage?
[00:41:25.911 --> 00:41:27.833]  Are you joking?
[00:41:27.833 --> 00:41:30.495]  These people are total satanic demons trying to take over?
[00:41:30.495 --> 00:41:33.037]  I got courage to just sit back and let them take over?
[00:41:33.037 --> 00:41:36.881]  That's not courage.
[00:41:36.881 --> 00:41:40.304]  I fight these people because I'm concerned.
[00:41:40.304 --> 00:41:41.024]  I'm fighting.
[00:41:41.024 --> 00:41:42.746]  I wouldn't call it fear, it's concern.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.662]  And the only action is to expose them.
[00:41:47.662 --> 00:41:51.344]  So we're going to destroy Oprah Winfrey because she deserves it.
[00:41:51.344 --> 00:41:54.666]  She's a dirty pedophile supporter bare minimum.
[00:41:54.666 --> 00:41:55.887]  And we're going to go after everybody here.
[00:41:55.887 --> 00:41:57.828]  And we're going to take the gloves off.
[00:41:57.828 --> 00:42:00.609]  And like my buddy said, Rob, we're going to put the brass knuckles on.
[00:42:00.609 --> 00:42:02.571]  So the day I said during the break, I said, I'm taking the gloves off.
[00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:04.732]  He said, and then you need to put the brass knuckles on.
[00:42:04.732 --> 00:42:05.913]  And that's right.
[00:42:05.913 --> 00:42:09.315]  We're at a point now where I'm not just going to sit here and fight you with my bare fist.
[00:42:09.315 --> 00:42:10.996]  I'm going to put the brass knuckles on.
[00:42:11.926 --> 00:42:21.516]  That doesn't mean I'm going to exaggerate or I'm going to lie, but it means when I hit you, I'm going to hit you to break your ribs and break your jaw and knock your eyes out of your teeth to put your ass on the ground.
[00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:27.382]  Because you want to destroy humanity and bring in world government with forced inoculations and Satanism and pedophilia.
[00:42:27.382 --> 00:42:34.510]  So let me just say this, when I politically get a shot at you, I am going to punch to take you and put you down six feet under.
[00:42:37.503 --> 00:42:44.393]  That's a good thing because all you Satanists and devil worshippers have been running your mouths and arrogantly running around getting away with all sorts of stuff for a long time.
[00:42:44.393 --> 00:42:48.759]  Let me tell you, the season of your destruction is here.
[00:42:48.759 --> 00:42:49.380]  You understand that?
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:02.822]  And so like I told you a long time ago, it just came to me in a speech, I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[00:43:02.822 --> 00:43:11.924]  And what God wants is that spiritual decision to not be afraid and to not care and to step into your destiny and then God takes everything over from there.
[00:43:11.924 --> 00:43:15.385]  But you've got to make the decision and start taking action.
[00:43:15.385 --> 00:43:17.366]  And it begins going to church and speaking up.
[00:43:17.366 --> 00:43:19.026]  It begins going to city council speaking up.
[00:43:19.266 --> 00:43:23.647]  And calling to talk radio and getting aggressive and not just sitting there doing all this.
[00:43:23.647 --> 00:43:27.988]  You've got to do it now, now, now, now.
[00:43:27.988 --> 00:43:35.370]  Let's go to this LeBron James piece and I'll come back with General Flynn and all this other incredible news on this live original Saturday transmission.
[00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:42.872]  Please spread these live links on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, on your private messenger, on your email, in your word of mouth and break the will of Satan.
[00:43:42.872 --> 00:43:43.252]  Stay with us.
[00:43:44.196 --> 00:43:48.859]  You know, I used to be a fan of LeBron James.
[00:43:48.859 --> 00:43:50.400]  I grew up playing basketball.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.182]  Always was a basketball fan.
[00:43:52.182 --> 00:43:55.164]  Loved watching the NBA on TV.
[00:43:55.164 --> 00:44:05.591]  And sadly, what I've seen professional sports, and more than any of them, the NBA become, is a Marxist, Chinese, anti-American propaganda tool.
[00:44:06.383 --> 00:44:11.527]  And the leader of this in the NBA is LeBron James.
[00:44:11.527 --> 00:44:13.788]  LeBron, I used to be a big fan of yours, man.
[00:44:13.788 --> 00:44:16.170]  I liked watching you play basketball.
[00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:17.891]  I liked watching you win championships.
[00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:20.653]  I appreciated your greatness on the court.
[00:44:20.653 --> 00:44:23.054]  You truly are a great basketball player.
[00:44:23.054 --> 00:44:29.799]  But when it comes to a man, when it comes to an American, you're pathetic.
[00:44:29.799 --> 00:44:35.923]  And now that I know that LeBron James is a slave owner, yeah!
[00:44:36.806 --> 00:44:39.148]  Where do you think LeBron James shoes get made?
[00:44:39.148 --> 00:44:41.610]  Where do you think LeBron James jerseys get made?
[00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:45.213]  And his shirts and all the LeBron memorabilia?
[00:44:45.213 --> 00:44:45.693]  China!
[00:44:46.616 --> 00:44:49.258]  With child labor and slave labor.
[00:44:49.258 --> 00:44:52.421]  Now, LeBron James is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:44:52.421 --> 00:44:54.803]  Nike is a billion-dollar company.
[00:44:54.803 --> 00:45:01.749]  They could easily afford to pay Americans that LeBron James claims to care so much about with Black Lives Matter.
[00:45:01.749 --> 00:45:06.273]  They could afford to pay American kids, even, that want to get their first job.
[00:45:06.273 --> 00:45:08.615]  $15, even $20 an hour.
[00:45:08.615 --> 00:45:09.655]  Pretty good starting wage.
[00:45:10.649 --> 00:45:17.694]  And those American kids could earn that wage in American factories that make American shoes made in America.
[00:45:17.694 --> 00:45:19.055]  But LeBron James doesn't do that.
[00:45:19.055 --> 00:45:19.856]  Nike doesn't do that.
[00:45:19.856 --> 00:45:20.816]  No.
[00:45:20.816 --> 00:45:31.444]  Instead, he puts on the Black Lives Matter shirt, which we now know is just a Marxist, Communist, anti-family agenda.
[00:45:32.944 --> 00:45:35.166]  You can go look at it for yourself, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:38.969]  Black Lives Matter stands for Ending the Nuclear Family.
[00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:51.979]  And just like LeBron is a pathetic American for selling out to China, he's a pathetic father for selling out his own family and his own boys for the Black Lives Matter agenda.
[00:45:51.979 --> 00:45:55.922]  So I'm upset that I have to do this today.
[00:45:55.922 --> 00:46:00.366]  But we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna light this Trader's
[00:46:01.121 --> 00:46:08.765]  This communist trader's, this anti-American trader's jersey on fire here today.
[00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:12.787]  Because this is how America feels about the NBA right now.
[00:46:12.787 --> 00:46:18.069]  This is how America feels about the NBA catering and pandering to the Chinese communists.
[00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:27.274]  This is how America feels about athletes that make more money and are worth more money than the average American could ever even imagine taking a knee
[00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:39.275]  And telling us how we're privileged, taking a knee, telling us how we need to give up our rights, taking a knee, telling us how they're oppressed.
[00:46:39.275 --> 00:46:44.802]  So this is what America thinks now about LeBron James and the NBA.
[00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:46.404]  And by the way, it's mutual.
[00:46:47.315 --> 00:46:51.999]  Because LeBron James came out and said, we don't care if America watches our games or not.
[00:46:51.999 --> 00:46:53.900]  Why would he say something like that?
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:58.524]  Because he knows, ladies and gentlemen, they already sold out to the Chinese.
[00:46:58.524 --> 00:47:01.366]  They're already making their Chinese money.
[00:47:01.366 --> 00:47:11.515]  So if LeBron James ever wants to be taken seriously as a man, and as an American again, he needs to stop pandering for the Chicoms.
[00:47:11.515 --> 00:47:15.138]  He needs to stop attacking the American family.
[00:47:15.814 --> 00:47:23.959]  And he needs to stop attacking the values and principles that we stand for during the National Anthem in this country.
[00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:25.760]  But just know this.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.541]  LeBron James is not a basketball player.
[00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:29.562]  No.
[00:47:29.562 --> 00:47:44.170]  LeBron James is now a slave owner that makes all of his jerseys and shoes, and he's also now a leader of a domestic, anti-family, anti-American terror group known as Black Lives Matter.
[00:47:45.014 --> 00:47:58.004]  That's what LeBron James is.
[00:47:58.004 --> 00:48:00.326]  Mainstream media.
[00:48:00.326 --> 00:48:02.108]  Government cover-ups.
[00:48:02.108 --> 00:48:04.169]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:48:04.169 --> 00:48:06.331]  Well, so does he.
[00:48:06.331 --> 00:48:11.035]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48:13.089 --> 00:48:20.293]  So, LeBron James is another narcissistic, selfish person who thinks he's God and has total disdain for his fans.
[00:48:20.293 --> 00:48:21.834]  He endorsed Hillary Clinton.
[00:48:21.834 --> 00:48:25.216]  He's a mindless loser of the establishment.
[00:48:25.216 --> 00:48:28.017]  Now, is he selfish enough to want to have sex with kids?
[00:48:28.017 --> 00:48:29.998]  No, he's not a Bill Clinton, probably.
[00:48:29.998 --> 00:48:33.760]  But he still fronts and works for that very same system.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.761]  And are they raping kids in those Chinese death camps?
[00:48:35.761 --> 00:48:37.182]  Yeah, they're doing some of that.
[00:48:37.182 --> 00:48:40.104]  But mainly, they're just sucking their soul out.
[00:48:41.206 --> 00:48:48.207]  So the big news here, the reason we're live on this Saturday edition is President Trump makes cryptic remark at Ohio speech.
[00:48:48.207 --> 00:48:49.287]  I have a lot of enemies.
[00:48:49.287 --> 00:48:53.348]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[00:48:53.348 --> 00:48:54.568]  Talking about bringing U.S.
[00:48:54.568 --> 00:49:06.030]  pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States, cutting out more than $100 billion a year from globalist middlemen that set up regulations where we couldn't produce it here in the U.S.
[00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.791]  We want to turn the U.S.
[00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:07.531]  economy back on.
[00:49:07.531 --> 00:49:08.651]  Trump's doing it.
[00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:09.291]  He's the real deal.
[00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:15.377]  But first he's got to take the power in the industry back from the globalists.
[00:49:15.377 --> 00:49:20.382]  Then he can start shutting down the vaccine makers and others that he understands are frauds.
[00:49:20.382 --> 00:49:24.205]  And now he's got Biden eating out of his hand, coming out and saying, we can't trust the vaccine.
[00:49:24.205 --> 00:49:25.526]  Trump's accelerating it.
[00:49:25.526 --> 00:49:26.427]  We're not guaranteeing it.
[00:49:26.427 --> 00:49:28.208]  Trump said nobody has to take it.
[00:49:28.208 --> 00:49:30.670]  And Trump was getting control of the issue.
[00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.633]  So they would partisanly attack him so he could scuttle it.
[00:49:33.633 --> 00:49:35.715]  And now that has indeed taken place.
[00:49:37.179 --> 00:49:39.880]  Doesn't mean I agree with those type of Machiavellian activities.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:45.102]  All right, it is 249 and 35 seconds Central Standard Time.
[00:49:45.102 --> 00:49:46.502]  I'm going to read this important letter.
[00:49:46.502 --> 00:49:48.443]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:49:48.443 --> 00:49:50.544]  It's on Newswars.com.
[00:49:50.544 --> 00:49:56.546]  And it's from the former head of Defense Intelligence, who had access to all U.S.
[00:49:56.546 --> 00:50:00.467]  intelligence that is attached to the military or overseas.
[00:50:00.467 --> 00:50:01.728]  And Flynn, I can tell you,
[00:50:02.759 --> 00:50:16.862]  Became aware of the Clinton Foundation and the United Nations with the Communist Chinese, paying the Clintons more than $4 billion that they would then pay out through their foundation to other Democrats and other traders, some Republicans, mainly Democrats.
[00:50:16.862 --> 00:50:20.603]  And so when Trump brought him in as an advisor, that freaked him out.
[00:50:20.603 --> 00:50:27.985]  And then when he put him in there as the national security advisor, they went apocalyptic because he knew who was who.
[00:50:27.985 --> 00:50:30.886]  He would have advised Trump who to bring in to turn the whole thing around.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.261]  He was advising Trump to say, stop bringing in all these lawyers, people that have been in the swamp.
[00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:37.101]  They're all cowards.
[00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:37.781]  They're all scared.
[00:50:37.781 --> 00:50:45.283]  You need to bring in people out of private industry and out of the military who are officers, but are not traitors.
[00:50:45.283 --> 00:50:46.284]  And he was advising him.
[00:50:46.284 --> 00:50:48.184]  We're not talking three-star, four-star general.
[00:50:48.184 --> 00:50:53.845]  Most of those are globalists, but colonels, majors, things like that, they'll actually follow orders.
[00:50:53.845 --> 00:50:55.026]  Well, that scared the hell out of them.
[00:50:55.026 --> 00:50:56.626]  They had Flynn under surveillance.
[00:50:56.626 --> 00:50:58.487]  They tried to set him up, put him in prison.
[00:50:58.487 --> 00:50:59.247]  You know the rest of the story.
[00:51:01.869 --> 00:51:02.750]  Ordered released.
[00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:05.892]  He's been ordered to have the charges dropped.
[00:51:05.892 --> 00:51:11.056]  But the judge won't do it because it's all about the globalist holding on.
[00:51:11.056 --> 00:51:12.757]  What does Comey say when he puts letters out?
[00:51:12.757 --> 00:51:14.359]  Hold on.
[00:51:14.359 --> 00:51:17.441]  Stay in the government.
[00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.302]  We'll defeat Trump.
[00:51:18.302 --> 00:51:20.463]  He'll be gone soon.
[00:51:20.463 --> 00:51:21.244]  That's what Pelosi says.
[00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:21.684]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:51:21.684 --> 00:51:22.565]  He'll be gone soon.
[00:51:22.565 --> 00:51:23.766]  We're going to remove him.
[00:51:24.787 --> 00:51:33.493]  We're going to have a coup because they need their people to have faith and not drop their one-eyed globalist flag and run for the hills.
[00:51:33.493 --> 00:51:35.735]  They're trying to rally their troops, but they're losing.
[00:51:37.133 --> 00:51:43.355]  Trump is going to win by a landslide in the real numbers, but because of election fraud, mail-in ballots, and the rest of it, he's in grave danger of losing.
[00:51:43.355 --> 00:51:48.137]  But even if he loses, folks, the last four years have been devastating to the enemy.
[00:51:48.137 --> 00:51:49.257]  We have revealed them.
[00:51:49.257 --> 00:51:51.038]  We've drawn them out in the open.
[00:51:51.038 --> 00:51:53.199]  They're now trying to overthrow all the local governments.
[00:51:53.199 --> 00:51:54.919]  They're trying to overthrow the police.
[00:51:54.919 --> 00:51:59.601]  People now irrevocably know the truth about election fraud.
[00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:02.862]  Nobody votes for Democrats in blue cities.
[00:52:02.862 --> 00:52:03.802]  Democrats get control.
[00:52:03.802 --> 00:52:06.023]  They never lose a city because it's fraud.
[00:52:08.171 --> 00:52:13.614]  So General Flynn gets sent to meetings, you know, he gets sent to set up meetings with Putin and other leaders, and then they call that illegal.
[00:52:13.614 --> 00:52:16.015]  All right, let's continue.
[00:52:16.015 --> 00:52:17.996]  Here is the article.
[00:52:17.996 --> 00:52:19.797]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:52:19.797 --> 00:52:25.000]  If there's any homework out there, but what fun homework, saving humanity in the country.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.281]  Share this article from Infowars.com.
[00:52:27.281 --> 00:52:29.622]  General Flynn issues emergency warning.
[00:52:29.622 --> 00:52:32.564]  Communists are attempting to overthrow the United States.
[00:52:32.564 --> 00:52:34.185]  All right, General Flynn, here it is.
[00:52:35.828 --> 00:52:40.289]  We are witnessing a vicious assault by enemies of all that is good.
[00:52:40.289 --> 00:52:45.530]  And our president is having to act in ways unprecedented in decades, maybe centuries.
[00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:53.772]  The biblical nature of good versus evil cannot be discounted as we examine what is happening on the streets of America.
[00:52:53.772 --> 00:53:03.935]  It's Marxism in the form of anti-fund Black Lives Matter movement versus our very capable and very underrepresented law enforcement professionals.
[00:53:05.489 --> 00:53:05.749]  I don't know.
[00:53:24.482 --> 00:53:26.683]  We recognize the divine providence.
[00:53:26.683 --> 00:53:27.904]  That's so key.
[00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:33.207]  We recognize the divine providence, right, General Flynn, is the ultimate judge of our destiny.
[00:53:33.207 --> 00:53:41.813]  Achieving our destiny as a freedom-loving nation, providence compels us to do our part in our communities.
[00:53:41.813 --> 00:53:46.335]  We were given the providence by God through our ancestors.
[00:53:46.335 --> 00:53:48.137]  We can't let them down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:48.137 --> 00:53:51.198]  They were total winners.
[00:53:51.198 --> 00:53:53.280]  It encourages us, that is providence,
[00:53:54.639 --> 00:54:00.463]  In the battle against the forces of evil to face our fears head on.
[00:54:00.463 --> 00:54:06.928]  No enemy on earth is stronger than the united forces of God fearing freedom loving people.
[00:54:06.928 --> 00:54:07.809]  Say that again.
[00:54:07.809 --> 00:54:14.274]  No enemy on earth is stronger than the forces of God fearing people.
[00:54:14.274 --> 00:54:17.156]  No enemy!
[00:54:17.156 --> 00:54:19.838]  Antifa can hardly wipe its ass!
[00:54:19.838 --> 00:54:22.320]  But we bow to it because we're scared of the media and the culture.
[00:54:26.618 --> 00:54:33.243]  We can no longer pretend that these dark forces are going to go away with mere prayer alone.
[00:54:33.243 --> 00:54:35.685]  That's right.
[00:54:35.685 --> 00:54:38.267]  God demands we take action.
[00:54:38.267 --> 00:54:41.470]  Prayers matter, but action is required.
[00:54:43.851 --> 00:54:47.072]  The action is needed at the local, state, and federal levels.
[00:54:47.072 --> 00:54:54.134]  Action is also required in the economic, media, clerical, and ecclesiastical realms.
[00:54:54.134 --> 00:55:02.817]  But they put cowards in almost all those positions because they feared men like General Flynn and men and women like you.
[00:55:02.817 --> 00:55:05.117]  You can't be bought.
[00:55:05.117 --> 00:55:07.838]  You can't be intimidated.
[00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:09.819]  What's that line?
[00:55:09.819 --> 00:55:11.279]  Perfectly written by Hank Williams Jr.
[00:55:11.279 --> 00:55:13.680]  Because you can't starve us out.
[00:55:15.302 --> 00:55:19.283]  You can't make us run because these old boys were raised on shotguns.
[00:55:19.283 --> 00:55:24.105]  We say grace, we say amen, and if you ain't into that, we don't give a damn.
[00:55:24.105 --> 00:55:29.506]  Because it's even got the thing at the Pharisees that tell you saying damn is evil because you meant to take God's name in vain.
[00:55:29.506 --> 00:55:30.827]  I didn't take God's name in vain.
[00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:33.247]  I said, I don't give a damn.
[00:55:33.247 --> 00:55:34.708]  It's your interpretation.
[00:55:34.708 --> 00:55:38.629]  Oh, but the child molesters screw kids all day, but don't say God damn it.
[00:55:38.629 --> 00:55:42.190]  That's just some Baptist thing that they cooked up to tell you
[00:55:43.482 --> 00:55:45.103]  Was taking God's name in vain.
[00:55:45.103 --> 00:55:46.823]  I don't take the Lord's name in vain!
[00:55:46.823 --> 00:55:49.964]  I ask the name of Jesus Christ that he damn these people to hell!
[00:55:49.964 --> 00:55:51.865]  The quicker the better!
[00:55:51.865 --> 00:55:55.386]  I don't take Jesus's name in vain when I say God damn them to hell!
[00:55:55.386 --> 00:55:58.007]  The name of Jesus Christ!
[00:55:58.007 --> 00:56:02.948]  They don't want... When Trump marched over to that church they burned and had the Bible and called on God.
[00:56:02.948 --> 00:56:04.309]  They said it was the worst thing.
[00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:05.369]  He should never do it.
[00:56:05.369 --> 00:56:08.670]  They attacked and squealed because he was calling down God's power!
[00:56:11.084 --> 00:56:15.407]  When you ask God to damn these people to hell, you're asking God to protect you!
[00:56:15.407 --> 00:56:20.591]  I don't need that what some fancy-pants church person tells me.
[00:56:20.591 --> 00:56:21.592]  I know.
[00:56:21.592 --> 00:56:22.452]  I have a conscience.
[00:56:22.452 --> 00:56:26.215]  I know what God likes and what God doesn't like.
[00:56:26.215 --> 00:56:27.516]  And God doesn't like cowards.
[00:56:31.328 --> 00:56:34.910]  And then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs apologized that he walked over with Trump.
[00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:38.832]  Oh, the President, he can't even tell you hydroxychloroquine's good.
[00:56:38.832 --> 00:56:41.894]  He can't even tell you when something's a bombing, when it is.
[00:56:41.894 --> 00:56:45.896]  Oh, he can't march over to a church to give solid... He can't do anything!
[00:56:45.896 --> 00:56:48.797]  He can't... The media will attack us!
[00:56:48.797 --> 00:56:50.098]  Good!
[00:56:50.098 --> 00:56:51.699]  They're the pedophile media!
[00:56:51.699 --> 00:56:53.079]  They're the Chai Com media!
[00:56:53.079 --> 00:56:55.621]  They better be attacking you, or you're not a good person!
[00:57:00.267 --> 00:57:02.148]  People ask me, how are you taking all these attacks?
[00:57:02.148 --> 00:57:03.668]  I'm taking it damn good!
[00:57:03.668 --> 00:57:04.848]  Means I'm over the target!
[00:57:04.848 --> 00:57:09.270]  I didn't get in this fight to play games or to be some fancy pants famous person!
[00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:13.051]  I got in this fight to win!
[00:57:13.051 --> 00:57:15.511]  Let's go back to General Flynn.
[00:57:15.511 --> 00:57:21.733]  We can no longer pretend that these dark forces are going to go away by mere prayer alone.
[00:57:21.733 --> 00:57:24.534]  Prayers matter because God directs you.
[00:57:24.534 --> 00:57:25.974]  But action is required.
[00:57:25.974 --> 00:57:26.495]  Exactly.
[00:57:26.495 --> 00:57:27.655]  Prayer leads the action.
[00:57:28.669 --> 00:57:30.609]  Faith without works is dead.
[00:57:30.609 --> 00:57:34.970]  The action is needed at the local, state, and federal levels.
[00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:43.192]  Action is also required in the economic, media, clerical, and ecclesiastical realms.
[00:57:43.192 --> 00:57:45.573]  Decide how you can act within your abilities.
[00:57:45.573 --> 00:57:48.653]  Stand up and state your beliefs.
[00:57:48.653 --> 00:57:52.874]  Be proud of who you are and what you stand for.
[00:57:52.874 --> 00:57:55.215]  And face head-on
[00:57:56.701 --> 00:58:11.192]  The community leaders, he puts that in quotes, who are willing to allow dark forces to go beyond peaceful protest and destroy and violate your safety and security.
[00:58:11.192 --> 00:58:14.394]  Churches and houses of worship must return to normal.
[00:58:14.394 --> 00:58:24.222]  We want everyone of goodwill to not shrink their responsibilities and shirk responsibilities and instead act in a fraternal fashion, a family.
[00:58:26.061 --> 00:58:38.335]  If for no other reason, or with no other ability, act in a spirit of charity, we cannot disrespect or disregard natural law along with our own religious liberties and freedoms.
[00:58:39.835 --> 00:58:44.399]  I am witnessing elderly people lose their connection to all that is good in their lives.
[00:58:44.399 --> 00:58:47.601]  Connections to their faith, their families, and their individual freedoms.
[00:58:47.601 --> 00:58:50.624]  Especially the simple act of attending church.
[00:58:50.624 --> 00:58:55.128]  Something they have been doing for decades because it's a spiritual connection to God and to the earth.
[00:58:55.128 --> 00:58:56.609]  The enemy wants it cut.
[00:58:56.609 --> 00:58:58.510]  We've got to intensify it.
[00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:04.295]  Let us not be intimidated or fear those who cry out that we are the minority.
[00:59:04.295 --> 00:59:06.057]  We are not!
[00:59:06.057 --> 00:59:08.779]  Good is always more powerful and will prevail over evil.
[00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:23.094]  However, evil will succeed for a time when good people are divided from each other and their personal lives, children away from their teachers, preachers from their congregations, customers from their local businesses.
[00:59:23.094 --> 00:59:25.915]  America will never give in to evil.
[00:59:25.915 --> 00:59:29.076]  Americans work together to solve problems.
[00:59:29.076 --> 00:59:31.257]  That's right, we must identify the enemy of the globalists.
[00:59:31.257 --> 00:59:32.337]  The globalists are the enemy.
[00:59:32.337 --> 00:59:32.977]  They must be defeated.
[00:59:34.639 --> 00:59:42.926]  We do not and should not ever allow anarchy and the evil forces behind it to operate on any street in our nation.
[00:59:42.926 --> 00:59:48.431]  No one should have fear for their life because some dark, disturbed force is challenging
[00:59:49.574 --> 00:59:53.136]  And challenged by the way, the very essence of what America stands for.
[00:59:53.136 --> 00:59:54.156]  Let's read that again.
[00:59:54.156 --> 00:59:55.137]  Your existence is what they hate.
[00:59:55.137 --> 00:59:56.378]  This is an inspired letter.
[01:00:11.172 --> 01:00:19.078]  We are one nation under God, and it is our individual liberties that make us strong, not liberties given by our government.
[01:00:19.078 --> 01:00:23.461]  Our government has no liberty unless and until we, the people, say so!
[01:00:23.461 --> 01:00:25.282]  That's right, it comes from us!
[01:00:25.282 --> 01:00:26.904]  We get it from God!
[01:00:26.904 --> 01:00:33.468]  God bless America, and let's stand by everything that was and is good in our lives, in our communities, and in our country.
[01:00:33.468 --> 01:00:39.553]  Otherwise, America, as the true North Star of humanity, will cease to exist as we know it.
[01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:44.260]  I just said a few weeks ago that America is the North Star.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.841]  This is absolutely inspired by God.
[01:00:45.841 --> 01:00:49.003]  This is such an important letter.
[01:00:49.003 --> 01:00:51.245]  And I pray that you will get it and I pray you will share it.
[01:01:04.025 --> 01:01:05.345]  I need to cover all this news now.
[01:01:05.345 --> 01:01:07.386]  I got all ready with all this.
[01:01:07.386 --> 01:01:10.006]  I've only covered the surface, but man.
[01:01:10.006 --> 01:01:16.287]  Oprah Winfrey, a perverted, demonic child victim herself.
[01:01:16.287 --> 01:01:21.288]  Just getting sexually excited talking about pleasuring little boys.
[01:01:21.288 --> 01:01:22.669]  It's just too much to handle, man.
[01:01:22.669 --> 01:01:25.329]  This is just ridiculous.
[01:01:25.329 --> 01:01:26.790]  But I spent too much time on that.
[01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:32.131]  It just makes me sick.
[01:01:32.131 --> 01:01:33.611]  And I've got all this other news to hit.
[01:01:34.963 --> 01:01:37.066]  On the fraud and the election fraud and everything.
[01:01:37.066 --> 01:01:41.031]  I need a couple minutes after reading that letter.
[01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:47.661]  So let's... Let's air a few of these and just let these speak for themselves.
[01:01:50.293 --> 01:01:54.975]  Woman left with severe bruising after being arrested by police for being outside during lockdown.
[01:01:54.975 --> 01:01:55.895]  During the day!
[01:01:55.895 --> 01:01:57.676]  Can't go outside your house in a bunch of cities in Australia.
[01:01:57.676 --> 01:01:59.636]  Because they're under you in control.
[01:01:59.636 --> 01:02:01.397]  Shameful conservative leader there.
[01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:03.358]  Pure evil.
[01:02:03.358 --> 01:02:05.699]  It's all based on a hoax.
[01:02:05.699 --> 01:02:09.980]  And that ties into Victoria Police forced to smash car windows over non-compliance.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.601]  Oh, they're forced to smash them over non-compliance.
[01:02:12.601 --> 01:02:13.961]  It's just a total power grab.
[01:02:13.961 --> 01:02:15.982]  You talk about bad police, bad government.
[01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.643]  This is when the police are bad.
[01:02:18.283 --> 01:02:22.808]  When they're following the New World Order edict, so dangerous.
[01:02:22.808 --> 01:02:23.869]  But let's air only part of that.
[01:02:23.869 --> 01:02:28.333]  I don't want to air all of clip five because it's too long.
[01:02:28.333 --> 01:02:36.381]  Let's air clip three, part of clip four, and then reported rapist released from jail due to COVID-19 murders.
[01:02:41.101 --> 01:02:41.722]  You know what?
[01:02:41.722 --> 01:02:43.466]  Let's not air that.
[01:02:43.466 --> 01:02:44.668]  I'm going to air that later.
[01:02:44.668 --> 01:02:45.109]  Let's do this.
[01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:46.051]  Let's air clip seven.
[01:02:46.051 --> 01:02:47.133]  It's only two and a half minutes long.
[01:02:47.133 --> 01:02:48.536]  Darin McBrain put this together.
[01:02:48.536 --> 01:02:49.939]  November 2020 is the name of the video.
[01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:55.489]  We started the show with it, but in case you just tuned in, a lot of folks, the average person watches like 20 minutes, we know.
[01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:57.750]  So I've been on air for an hour and two minutes now.
[01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.991]  I started the show with this, but Darren put this together.
[01:02:59.991 --> 01:03:02.932]  This is only part of them saying we're going to have a coup against the president.
[01:03:02.932 --> 01:03:04.753]  He's going to try to stay in office.
[01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:08.275]  That's the way they legitimize removing him outside of law.
[01:03:08.275 --> 01:03:11.356]  They plan to remove him before the election on the next 86 days.
[01:03:11.356 --> 01:03:12.036]  That's their plan.
[01:03:12.036 --> 01:03:13.237]  Will they succeed?
[01:03:13.237 --> 01:03:14.177]  Pray to God they won't.
[01:03:14.177 --> 01:03:15.098]  Take action, they won't.
[01:03:15.098 --> 01:03:16.278]  That's how it works.
[01:03:16.278 --> 01:03:16.899]  Pray to God.
[01:03:16.899 --> 01:03:19.840]  God gives you the discernment, the blueprint.
[01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:22.446]  Lead guys and direct you.
[01:03:22.446 --> 01:03:23.868]  Pray more.
[01:03:23.868 --> 01:03:25.410]  God gives you the next directive.
[01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.353]  And the more you carry out, the more you get.
[01:03:27.353 --> 01:03:29.976]  God never gives you more than you can handle.
[01:03:29.976 --> 01:03:32.259]  I will warn some of you though.
[01:03:32.259 --> 01:03:35.023]  I've been given everything I asked for.
[01:03:35.023 --> 01:03:37.266]  But they say with great knowledge comes great sorrow.
[01:03:40.438 --> 01:03:44.279]  Imagine the Satanists are just these content demons.
[01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:46.020]  They have no idea what they've done.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.520]  Like Christ said, forgive them, Father.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.920]  They know not what they've done.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.521]  God, if they knew what they've done, they'd be so scared.
[01:03:52.521 --> 01:03:53.642]  They want the secrets of the universe.
[01:03:53.642 --> 01:03:55.282]  It's all right there with Christ.
[01:03:55.282 --> 01:03:55.842]  Here's the report.
[01:03:55.842 --> 01:03:56.723]  We'll be back in two and a half minutes.
[01:04:07.078 --> 01:04:14.782]  A so-called anti-fascist website is encouraging, quote, all manner of physical violence against Trump supporters and capitalists.
[01:04:14.782 --> 01:04:19.965]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[01:04:19.965 --> 01:04:26.449]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[01:04:26.449 --> 01:04:27.730]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:31.433]  I'll join a million other people surrounding the United States Capitol.
[01:04:31.433 --> 01:04:38.238]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[01:04:38.238 --> 01:04:39.999]  This is a national emergency.
[01:04:39.999 --> 01:04:44.983]  Joe Biden says he is concerned President Trump will try to steal the November election.
[01:04:44.983 --> 01:04:47.045]  This president is going to try to steal this election.
[01:04:47.045 --> 01:04:52.289]  This is a trial run for the President of the United States, who may be organizing
[01:04:52.987 --> 01:04:57.689]  Uh, to not accept, uh, what happens when we have the election.
[01:04:57.689 --> 01:05:05.092]  If he loses, and I expect that he will, then we have to be prepared for what he is going to do in the immediate aftermath of such a loss.
[01:05:05.092 --> 01:05:08.154]  Whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving.
[01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:13.036]  You have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:21.194]  And you have so many rank-and-file military personnel saying, whoa, we're not a military state.
[01:05:21.194 --> 01:05:22.535]  This is not who we are.
[01:05:22.535 --> 01:05:27.557]  If he's not elected, is he going to pull out his military?
[01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:29.258]  Is he going to engage us?
[01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:34.880]  He has already alluded to there may be a civil war.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.682]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[01:05:38.682 --> 01:05:40.303]  No borders, no walls!
[01:05:42.523 --> 01:05:45.565]  These are not acts of peaceful protest.
[01:05:45.565 --> 01:05:48.827]  These are acts of domestic terror.
[01:05:48.827 --> 01:05:50.088]  Seriously, Mr. President?
[01:05:50.088 --> 01:05:55.392]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders.
[01:05:55.392 --> 01:06:00.295]  Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration.
[01:06:00.295 --> 01:06:04.918]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[01:06:04.918 --> 01:06:10.402]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.
[01:06:10.402 --> 01:06:11.483]  Government's gonna kill this guy.
[01:06:15.703 --> 01:06:17.324]  So I have a lot of enemies out there.
[01:06:17.324 --> 01:06:19.144]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[01:06:19.144 --> 01:06:24.706]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing.
[01:06:24.706 --> 01:06:35.510]  But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other president's gonna do what I do.
[01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:37.231]  All right, we're live on Saturday.
[01:06:37.231 --> 01:06:38.991]  It's 3-0-6 Central.
[01:06:38.991 --> 01:06:43.313]  And if you're watching this on the audio streams or video streams, listening to the streams or watching the video streams,
[01:06:45.219 --> 01:06:49.581]  It'll be obviously looping, but we're live right now.
[01:06:49.581 --> 01:06:51.502]  And I cut several reports.
[01:06:51.502 --> 01:06:52.683]  We're going to premiere here as well.
[01:06:52.683 --> 01:06:57.225]  At the end, I will be taking calls on the Sunday show four to 6 PM tomorrow.
[01:06:57.225 --> 01:07:03.128]  If we're still here on air, because with how crazy the world is folks, I don't take any day or any minute for granted.
[01:07:03.128 --> 01:07:06.410]  Now let's blitz through news now as quickly as we can.
[01:07:08.882 --> 01:07:11.883]  But every second I'm thinking, what do we do to expose the deep state coup?
[01:07:11.883 --> 01:07:13.624]  What do we do to expose their operation?
[01:07:13.624 --> 01:07:20.127]  What do we do to warn America that this isn't like the past attacks that were just probing and conditioning us to stand down when they do outrageous stuff?
[01:07:20.127 --> 01:07:21.608]  This is the big attack.
[01:07:21.608 --> 01:07:23.068]  This is the big takedown.
[01:07:23.068 --> 01:07:25.869]  This is the big move.
[01:07:25.869 --> 01:07:28.310]  Well, the biggest thing you can do is raise the alarm.
[01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:32.112]  The globalists are more afraid of this show than any other.
[01:07:32.112 --> 01:07:34.133]  And I don't say that on a power trip.
[01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:37.274]  Tucker Carlson is very riveting, very populist.
[01:07:37.274 --> 01:07:38.315]  He does an amazing job.
[01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:43.001]  But he's unable to get into the really hardcore stuff that we are.
[01:07:43.001 --> 01:07:44.541]  And he recognizes that.
[01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:45.502]  Publicly and privately.
[01:07:45.502 --> 01:07:47.603]  And I'm not trying to say I'm in competition with Tucker.
[01:07:47.603 --> 01:07:47.943]  I'm not.
[01:07:47.943 --> 01:07:51.405]  I wish Tucker Carlson reached out to a billion people a day.
[01:07:51.405 --> 01:07:54.986]  I wish Tucker Carlson was way better than I was saying all this and I could not do it anymore.
[01:07:54.986 --> 01:07:57.948]  Because believe me, you know, I'm not scared to do this.
[01:07:57.948 --> 01:07:58.768]  It's exhausting though.
[01:07:59.858 --> 01:08:01.399]  Like someday I walk about to shoot me in the head.
[01:08:01.399 --> 01:08:02.639]  I'm like, Oh, thank God.
[01:08:02.639 --> 01:08:03.299]  I mean, I don't want to die.
[01:08:03.299 --> 01:08:06.040]  I'll never commit suicide, but I'm like, Oh wow.
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.621]  Because I mean, it's a responsibility.
[01:08:07.621 --> 01:08:08.061]  You know what I mean?
[01:08:08.061 --> 01:08:10.022]  I just want to be with God.
[01:08:10.022 --> 01:08:12.863]  So anyways, never commit suicide.
[01:08:12.863 --> 01:08:13.223]  Love life.
[01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:13.984]  But you know what I mean?
[01:08:13.984 --> 01:08:16.364]  It's like a duty.
[01:08:16.364 --> 01:08:21.166]  It's an old native American saying that the leadership is about submitting to duty.
[01:08:21.166 --> 01:08:22.667]  It's not about the high heights of power.
[01:08:23.968 --> 01:08:27.050]  Because these tyrants just get off on their power to control people.
[01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:30.612]  Those of us that have responsibility, we just want to turn it around and it's exhausting.
[01:08:30.612 --> 01:08:33.353]  But, continuing.
[01:08:33.353 --> 01:08:35.214]  We've got several videos here.
[01:08:35.214 --> 01:08:37.896]  I don't have a lot of time to play them, but we'll roll some B-roll of this.
[01:08:37.896 --> 01:08:40.597]  They're up on Infowars.com.
[01:08:40.597 --> 01:08:44.299]  Remember Trump, two years ago, officially pulls U.S.
[01:08:44.299 --> 01:08:46.661]  out of the U.N.
[01:08:46.661 --> 01:08:47.121]  Remember that?
[01:08:48.342 --> 01:08:58.532]  Out of the UN Migration Treaty, because under that, signed by George Herbert Walker Bush in 1992, the UN said who we would let in and who could come in.
[01:08:58.532 --> 01:09:11.145]  So that's why when you see footage out of France, or out of Spain, or out of Italy, or out of the UK now, stuff like this, British man arrested for filming migrants being loaded onto coach buses, Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars.com.
[01:09:13.089 --> 01:09:27.704]  A British YouTuber was arrested after he tried to livestream footage of boat migrants being loaded onto coaches, that's buses, in Dover, famous white cliffs of Dover in England, before they were taken to accommodations at three and four-star hotels at taxpayer expense.
[01:09:27.704 --> 01:09:35.812]  Assistant reporter who goes by the name ActivePatriot, I want to get him on, was recording the scene, the public car park, and he was aggressively approached by police.
[01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:40.311]  Yeah, they don't even do this to Muslim pedophiles, but British citizens are the enemy.
[01:09:40.311 --> 01:09:41.811]  The police are really bad in the UK.
[01:09:41.811 --> 01:09:43.231]  Total New World Order, folks.
[01:09:43.231 --> 01:09:44.471]  True enemies.
[01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:47.352]  The left gets control here, the police will be the enemy.
[01:09:47.352 --> 01:09:49.952]  I'm showing the world what's going on, mate, says a reporter.
[01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:51.193]  What's the officer's response?
[01:09:51.193 --> 01:09:53.173]  I think the world knows.
[01:09:53.173 --> 01:09:55.053]  Do they really?
[01:09:55.053 --> 01:09:56.914]  They don't know the extent, though, do they?
[01:09:56.914 --> 01:09:58.614]  Active Patriot response.
[01:09:58.614 --> 01:10:04.455]  First, the officer claims he's arresting him for trespassing charges at the parking lot, but later says breaching the peace.
[01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:11.513]  I guess they didn't want them seeing those kids being loaded either, huh?
[01:10:11.513 --> 01:10:16.517]  Meanwhile, they came to Nigel Farage's house for being at the same port a month ago and threatened to arrest him.
[01:10:16.517 --> 01:10:19.979]  He could be the British Prime Minister, he's so popular.
[01:10:19.979 --> 01:10:22.681]  High-level Member of Parliament in the EU and the UK.
[01:10:22.681 --> 01:10:25.483]  They came and said, you don't film, even though it's totally legal.
[01:10:25.483 --> 01:10:26.424]  This is the intimidation.
[01:10:26.424 --> 01:10:29.126]  These police are monsters.
[01:10:29.126 --> 01:10:34.510]  Police stopped media interview with RT with Asylum Seeker amid controversy of migrants living in UK hotels.
[01:10:35.848 --> 01:10:38.950]  The more they try to shut it down, the more it comes out.
[01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:47.394]  So that's what Soros and the Globalists and their whole thing are funding.
[01:10:47.394 --> 01:10:49.815]  That's what they're running.
[01:10:49.815 --> 01:10:52.897]  Let's get into the latest COVID-19 news and information now.
[01:10:56.345 --> 01:10:57.966]  World's Top Epidemiologist.
[01:10:57.966 --> 01:10:59.768]  This is on Infowars.com and Zero Hedge.
[01:10:59.768 --> 01:11:07.294]  It has all these links to the heads of Sweden, the heads of Norway, the heads of... I mean, the top just saying it's a total fraud, it's a total lie.
[01:11:07.294 --> 01:11:14.900]  Whoever doesn't have the mask has the lowest deaths of COVID-19 because they're not counting the flu and other stuff as it.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.461]  World's Top Epidemiologist.
[01:11:16.461 --> 01:11:17.822]  Mask don't work.
[01:11:17.822 --> 01:11:18.683]  Huge article.
[01:11:18.683 --> 01:11:21.064]  Might want to get it out to everybody you know if you want to defeat the enemy.
[01:11:21.064 --> 01:11:22.846]  This is more homework to take action.
[01:11:24.619 --> 01:11:26.180]  Bill Gates came out in town hall.
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:28.241]  America's coronavirus testing is garbage.
[01:11:28.241 --> 01:11:32.864]  He had his own testing facilities shut down because they were giving false positives.
[01:11:32.864 --> 01:11:38.648]  Now because he knows he's lost the fight, he comes out and exposes what he himself has done.
[01:11:38.648 --> 01:11:40.349]  Let's roll the video of this.
[01:11:40.349 --> 01:11:49.054]  Woman left with severe bruising after being arrested by police for being outside locked down with her daughter.
[01:11:49.054 --> 01:11:51.876]  Out in the daylight, not allowed to leave your homes.
[01:11:53.519 --> 01:12:00.822]  In major cities like Melbourne, Australia, and this is the true face of what's coming here with the U.N.
[01:12:00.822 --> 01:12:04.924]  contact tracers run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with the Clinton Foundation.
[01:12:04.924 --> 01:12:07.965]  Here is the shocking footage.
[01:12:07.965 --> 01:12:10.206]  She's in pain.
[01:12:10.206 --> 01:12:11.267]  She's in pain.
[01:12:11.267 --> 01:12:12.948]  She says she's in pain.
[01:12:12.948 --> 01:12:15.329]  I need you to give them your identification.
[01:12:15.329 --> 01:12:17.330]  I don't have my ID.
[01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:18.110]  Well then where is it?
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:22.361]  Globalists want to rape you with vaccines, rape you with lockdowns.
[01:12:22.361 --> 01:12:23.261]  This is martial law.
[01:12:23.261 --> 01:12:25.282]  I think she's got a sign.
[01:12:25.282 --> 01:12:27.523]  I think her crime was she was protesting.
[01:12:27.523 --> 01:12:28.183]  How dare you, slave!
[01:12:47.521 --> 01:12:50.606]  Australia never stopped me in a prison colony.
[01:12:50.606 --> 01:12:54.172]  Great people, but has this veneer of freedom.
[01:12:54.172 --> 01:12:55.815]  They're going to lose because of this.
[01:12:55.815 --> 01:12:58.559]  She's wearing the mask, but it's not enough.
[01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:05.972]  Those police officers need to be arrested.
[01:13:05.972 --> 01:13:07.893]  Enemies of humanity.
[01:13:07.893 --> 01:13:09.373]  Tell me how I'm doing.
[01:13:09.373 --> 01:13:10.614]  I'm not doing anything wrong.
[01:13:10.614 --> 01:13:11.914]  Yes, you are doing something wrong.
[01:13:11.914 --> 01:13:15.836]  You're out in contravention of the COVID restrictions, alright?
[01:13:15.836 --> 01:13:17.276]  The COVID restrictions?
[01:13:17.276 --> 01:13:19.777]  When Australia... Pull up Australia's death numbers.
[01:13:19.777 --> 01:13:21.058]  It's like not even anything.
[01:13:21.058 --> 01:13:22.438]  And those are fake.
[01:13:22.438 --> 01:13:26.960]  I believe you are, so I need to confirm your ID.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.960]  Arrogant police.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.241]  Enemies of humanity.
[01:13:29.241 --> 01:13:29.961]  No, you tell me.
[01:13:29.961 --> 01:13:31.802]  You're the one being a smart-arse about this.
[01:13:37.381 --> 01:13:39.442]  Do they bruise these women up?
[01:13:39.442 --> 01:13:39.742]  Everything.
[01:13:39.742 --> 01:13:43.144]  They need to go after them politically.
[01:13:43.144 --> 01:13:44.785]  Let's continue.
[01:13:44.785 --> 01:13:52.470]  Pompeo says Communist China knew of person-to-person coronavirus transmission, but didn't tell anyone while conspiring with the United Nations.
[01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:56.492]  He says we're basically at war with China.
[01:13:56.492 --> 01:13:57.933]  It is a bad pneumonia.
[01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:59.354]  It is man-made.
[01:13:59.354 --> 01:14:02.596]  It's got incredible gain of function, so they can say everybody's guilty and has it.
[01:14:02.596 --> 01:14:05.778]  It's meant to lock down the West, but it's still not as bad as the flu.
[01:14:07.324 --> 01:14:08.284]  Are you wearing your mask?
[01:14:08.284 --> 01:14:12.065]  Because public health officials in Colorado are watching you.
[01:14:12.065 --> 01:14:18.907]  Private citizens have been hired to watch and videotape who's not wearing their mask, building their martial law lockdown armies.
[01:14:18.907 --> 01:14:24.128]  Wearing the mask, staying in your house is the cover for martial law, even when they kill the president.
[01:14:24.128 --> 01:14:24.668]  See?
[01:14:24.668 --> 01:14:28.869]  So they need that in place to say, oh, deadly spike, new virus, stay in your houses.
[01:14:28.869 --> 01:14:31.850]  And you're like, oh, it's not because we killed the president?
[01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.331]  And then they start arresting citizens.
[01:14:33.331 --> 01:14:33.911]  Oh, they're trouble.
[01:14:33.911 --> 01:14:34.411]  It's the cover.
[01:14:35.111 --> 01:14:36.632]  And once this hits, you can't submit, folks.
[01:14:36.632 --> 01:14:38.032]  You gotta fight.
[01:14:38.032 --> 01:14:39.893]  Have the police work with the globalists and do this?
[01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:42.954]  They become the enemy.
[01:14:42.954 --> 01:14:43.594]  Insanity.
[01:14:43.594 --> 01:14:50.997]  New Jersey State Teachers Union demands weekly COVID-19 tests, door-to-door, mandatory face mask, forced testing.
[01:14:50.997 --> 01:14:51.697]  It's all U.N.
[01:14:51.697 --> 01:14:53.578]  directed.
[01:14:53.578 --> 01:14:55.439]  All of it's a fraud.
[01:14:55.439 --> 01:14:59.521]  Inside the federal prison where three out of every four inmates have tested positive.
[01:14:59.521 --> 01:15:02.922]  Nobody's dying, but everybody's positive because it's all fake!
[01:15:04.065 --> 01:15:10.471]  Airline will pay medical and funeral costs to get people flying again in COVID-19 world.
[01:15:10.471 --> 01:15:16.956]  The Arab Emirates flight because they know statistically no one's dying so they can do that.
[01:15:16.956 --> 01:15:19.398]  And then this.
[01:15:19.398 --> 01:15:25.804]  Federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials on how best to persuade Americans to take COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:34.356]  And they say they shame you, and they tell you to be a hero, and they tell others to get angry at you.
[01:15:34.356 --> 01:15:35.558]  The 15 ways.
[01:15:35.558 --> 01:15:36.459]  Guilt message.
[01:15:36.459 --> 01:15:37.480]  Embarrassment message.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.341]  Anger message.
[01:15:38.341 --> 01:15:39.662]  Trust in science message.
[01:15:39.662 --> 01:15:42.325]  But everything Fauci told us.
[01:15:42.325 --> 01:15:44.127]  See if we can find him doing the pitch.
[01:15:44.127 --> 01:15:47.211]  Because everybody shows the pitch from the infield.
[01:15:47.211 --> 01:15:48.732]  What about the outfield behind him?
[01:15:48.732 --> 01:15:50.454]  He throws it 40-something feet to the left.
[01:15:51.141 --> 01:15:52.582]  And they cheer.
[01:15:52.582 --> 01:15:54.603]  Everything he does is a fraud.
[01:15:54.603 --> 01:15:57.444]  Psychological brainwashing testing at Yale.
[01:15:57.444 --> 01:15:58.645]  A federal test.
[01:15:58.645 --> 01:16:01.166]  And you see what they did in this test a few months ago?
[01:16:01.166 --> 01:16:05.869]  Is the talking points that the governors and the mayors are saying.
[01:16:05.869 --> 01:16:06.689]  Be a hero.
[01:16:06.689 --> 01:16:08.170]  Stay in.
[01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:09.070]  Don't wear a mask.
[01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:10.171]  Kill people.
[01:16:10.171 --> 01:16:11.852]  All lies.
[01:16:11.852 --> 01:16:13.253]  All fraud.
[01:16:13.253 --> 01:16:13.793]  Of the cult.
[01:16:15.017 --> 01:16:20.379]  Rape suspect who was freed due to coronavirus kills his accuser in Alexandria, police say.
[01:16:20.379 --> 01:16:24.160]  WUSA 9.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.821]  Francis St.
[01:16:25.821 --> 01:16:30.803]  Tropez Resort makes masks mandatory outdoors.
[01:16:30.803 --> 01:16:33.984]  And Denver's getting ready to do it.
[01:16:33.984 --> 01:16:35.865]  Airlines look at social distancing seats.
[01:16:38.206 --> 01:16:42.631]  Workers return to untouched office time capsules four months after lockdown.
[01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.814]  Call it very apocalyptic.
[01:16:44.814 --> 01:16:46.836]  Don't wait until there's total depression.
[01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:48.118]  The food prices are already exploding.
[01:16:48.118 --> 01:16:50.981]  You talk about apocalyptic.
[01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:53.564]  And the whole plan now is to devalue the dollar.
[01:16:53.564 --> 01:16:56.748]  The globalists are now saying we're going to devalue the dollar.
[01:16:57.674 --> 01:16:58.976]  And it'll be end of America.
[01:16:58.976 --> 01:17:01.339]  Yeah, we've got a big giant debt that's untenable.
[01:17:01.339 --> 01:17:06.345]  And then all these folks run around saying it's the end of America when China and the EU are more devalued.
[01:17:06.345 --> 01:17:10.971]  And then if we get devalued first and confidence is lost here, then we're not the world currency.
[01:17:10.971 --> 01:17:16.438]  And it'll make the Great Depression look like a cakewalk, a Boy Scout event, a walk in the park.
[01:17:23.342 --> 01:17:27.563]  This is such an incredible breakdown.
[01:17:27.563 --> 01:17:28.663]  This is a global reset.
[01:17:28.663 --> 01:17:32.324]  We told you that in Greg Reese's report.
[01:17:32.324 --> 01:17:33.025]  How many months ago?
[01:17:33.025 --> 01:17:35.465]  Go ask Greg Reese and he knew his report on global reset.
[01:17:35.465 --> 01:17:36.986]  We were all covering at the time.
[01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:40.567]  And then now Davos came out a week ago and said, this is the global reset.
[01:17:40.567 --> 01:17:44.228]  This is the cover for them popping the bubble to get you into debt.
[01:17:44.228 --> 01:17:46.288]  And they're getting into deeper debt right now.
[01:17:46.288 --> 01:17:49.009]  And I understand that President Trump wants to try to turn this around.
[01:17:50.575 --> 01:17:54.739]  And President Trump's come out with new stimulus packages and direct payments right to citizens.
[01:17:54.739 --> 01:17:57.983]  That's better than giving it to Jeff Bezos, who got $32 billion.
[01:17:57.983 --> 01:17:59.544]  But still, it will cause the inflation.
[01:17:59.544 --> 01:18:00.766]  But I get what Trump's saying.
[01:18:00.766 --> 01:18:02.347]  We stall, we die.
[01:18:02.347 --> 01:18:05.611]  And if we're not number one in the currency race, we die.
[01:18:05.611 --> 01:18:09.835]  So at this point, it's about us being the dominant currency worldwide when the others go down.
[01:18:09.835 --> 01:18:11.497]  So now it's about printing the dollar.
[01:18:13.206 --> 01:18:28.331]  Fiscal responsibility went out the window a long, long, long, long time ago and we're now in the time of mega massive crisis.
[01:18:28.331 --> 01:18:30.672]  Now let's look at this very important article.
[01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:33.973]  It's a CNN article.
[01:18:35.851 --> 01:18:37.792]  And I've seen this in North Carolina.
[01:18:37.792 --> 01:18:38.673]  I've seen it in Virginia.
[01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:39.973]  I've seen it in Minnesota.
[01:18:39.973 --> 01:18:41.014]  I've seen it in California.
[01:18:41.014 --> 01:18:41.994]  I've seen it in Oregon.
[01:18:41.994 --> 01:18:43.775]  I've seen it in Seattle.
[01:18:43.775 --> 01:18:48.678]  Where Democrats come out and claim, there's no Black Lives Matter rioting or burning anything.
[01:18:48.678 --> 01:18:51.700]  There's no Antifa.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.941]  Antifa's a myth, Nadler said.
[01:18:53.941 --> 01:18:56.763]  It's white supremacists dressed up.
[01:18:56.763 --> 01:19:01.085]  And I went, well, it's possible that white supremacists could false flag somebody.
[01:19:01.085 --> 01:19:02.166]  False flagging is so common.
[01:19:03.237 --> 01:19:06.419]  But to have the Democrats admitting that false flagging is a real thing.
[01:19:06.419 --> 01:19:17.167]  I'm being sued in Virginia for saying Soros funded both the right wing and left wing for a clash, which came out on record.
[01:19:17.167 --> 01:19:19.008]  The major universities doing it.
[01:19:19.008 --> 01:19:21.870]  Georgetown, Vatican.
[01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:27.674]  But CNN says the Umbrella Man is part of the Aryan Cowboys out of a prison.
[01:19:27.674 --> 01:19:28.915]  Oh, you mean a prison informant?
[01:19:30.373 --> 01:19:35.254]  So how many times have I told you they get white supremacists who aren't really white supremacists working for the left?
[01:19:35.254 --> 01:19:40.756]  It's come out in court many times to go out and do atrocities to then create division.
[01:19:40.756 --> 01:19:55.921]  But they can also fund one to go out and then have their identity super obvious with his umbrella to get all the attention to be the guy that led the 400 businesses being burned down in Minneapolis and the Black Lives Matter saying, burn the police station down.
[01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:56.941]  They all did that.
[01:19:59.366 --> 01:20:05.088]  But to say that the Umbrella Man did it because he's a white supremacist with no proof, who knows if any of that's true.
[01:20:05.088 --> 01:20:22.074]  But it's still incredible to see the left come out and admit that indeed that's something that really goes on false flagging.
[01:20:22.074 --> 01:20:24.535]  Now let's get into this stack of news right here.
[01:20:24.535 --> 01:20:26.336]  Ahead of these special reports will come up in a few minutes.
[01:20:29.943 --> 01:20:37.326]  QAnon is running amok, and the time has come for interventions, Bloomberg!
[01:20:37.326 --> 01:20:41.447]  Now I told you I know who set up QAnon a few years ago.
[01:20:41.447 --> 01:20:42.508]  One person's been in U.S.
[01:20:42.508 --> 01:20:44.068]  intelligence, the other person works for Trump.
[01:20:44.068 --> 01:20:45.209]  It was their idea.
[01:20:45.209 --> 01:20:46.509]  It got taken away from them.
[01:20:46.509 --> 01:20:47.550]  They got pissed about it.
[01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:48.270]  They told me that.
[01:20:51.328 --> 01:20:55.012]  Then it became this anti-Israel thing.
[01:20:55.012 --> 01:21:01.038]  But then it got taken away from those people and became like a real movement against the pedophile rings and the New World Order.
[01:21:01.038 --> 01:21:08.485]  So I said a few months ago, I guess about three months ago, we put a sticker out saying, I'm with Q. Be careful who tries to get you to do stuff.
[01:21:08.485 --> 01:21:09.786]  Make sure you know who you're working with.
[01:21:09.786 --> 01:21:14.131]  But the idea of citizens getting involved and exposing conspiracy and the New World Order is a good thing.
[01:21:15.356 --> 01:21:18.257]  I said about three months ago, I think it's becoming something positive.
[01:21:18.257 --> 01:21:28.082]  It started good because they looked at how I put out stuff against Hillary and Wikileaks and how I got attacked, how I got sued, how I got all those things that happened.
[01:21:28.082 --> 01:21:36.365]  And they said, how do we put out stuff about spirit cooking and devil worship and the child kidnapping rings and the new world order and the deep state and not get hurt?
[01:21:36.365 --> 01:21:37.486]  Well, we do it through 4chan and 8chan.
[01:21:40.779 --> 01:21:53.881]  But then that all got taken away and kind of got used for this delusional stuff that Robert Mueller's good and, you know, everything's taken care of and Trump's not in trouble and Trump's fine and he's won and everything's handled.
[01:21:53.881 --> 01:21:54.962]  Go to sleep.
[01:21:54.962 --> 01:21:57.682]  You saw Trump say, you may not be seeing him for a while.
[01:21:57.682 --> 01:21:58.502]  They may take him out.
[01:21:58.502 --> 01:21:58.982]  Big enemies.
[01:21:58.982 --> 01:22:00.143]  That's the president.
[01:22:00.143 --> 01:22:02.803]  I know he's not Q level, but you know, cause Q's above Jesus.
[01:22:02.803 --> 01:22:06.964]  Like the Q, the father, the son, the Holy ghost, Trump, you know, and then
[01:22:08.737 --> 01:22:09.657]  Am I being sarcastic?
[01:22:09.657 --> 01:22:11.358]  It's just ridiculous, folks.
[01:22:11.358 --> 01:22:13.619]  I am being sarcastic, but not overly.
[01:22:13.619 --> 01:22:14.899]  That was my problem with it.
[01:22:14.899 --> 01:22:16.660]  I mean, you know, I've talked to the president.
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:17.580]  I've talked to Roger Stone.
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:19.061]  I've been around 26 years.
[01:22:19.061 --> 01:22:21.722]  I mean, you know, I'm here.
[01:22:21.722 --> 01:22:32.086]  So, but now it's gotten so huge and so grassroots that I guess the original creators of it thought it had failed, but then it got even more successful, so I'm all for it.
[01:22:32.086 --> 01:22:34.646]  And the left's really upset about it.
[01:22:34.646 --> 01:22:35.747]  But if you're a Q person,
[01:22:38.188 --> 01:22:53.678]  You should watch Arlington Road and learn how they'll trick you to crash a train into a ship or pull a truck up in front of the Hoover Dam, and how they'll use globalist operatives to make you think you're with Q and make you think you're with secret agents and getting orders to go do things, and that is not the case.
[01:22:53.678 --> 01:23:01.504]  But if it's just about a Q movement exposing the New World Order and doing all that, that's great, but go off what you know!
[01:23:01.504 --> 01:23:03.945]  Go off what's admitted!
[01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:05.786]  Go off what Oprah Winfrey admits!
[01:23:06.877 --> 01:23:08.438]  Go after what's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:23:08.438 --> 01:23:12.119]  I wish the Cube people who are good folks, the followers are good.
[01:23:12.119 --> 01:23:13.440]  It's just, it's like anonymous.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.760]  Anybody can put a Guy Fawkes mask on.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.901]  Do I support anonymous?
[01:23:15.901 --> 01:23:17.041]  People ask me all the time, do you support anonymous?
[01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:19.002]  Well, do you support anonymous?
[01:23:19.002 --> 01:23:20.302]  The media would ask, is anonymous good?
[01:23:20.302 --> 01:23:21.483]  I'm like, well, it's anonymous.
[01:23:21.483 --> 01:23:23.143]  I don't know who's wearing a Guy Fawkes mask.
[01:23:23.143 --> 01:23:34.868]  So, but if we could get the Cube movement to go back to the 2016, hundreds of thousands of emails that we've killed ourselves going through, we're finding new bombshell stuff all the time in there.
[01:23:36.243 --> 01:23:44.829]  And that's what some intelligence operatives I know that have been working with the president who, I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:23:44.829 --> 01:24:00.940]  They like Q as an open source group to not just put out fake breadcrumbs that are esoteric, you know, nebulous stuff that people love as an Easter egg hunt, but to go, oh, here's the new WikiLeaks and a big Q site on Facebook before it got banned.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.401]  That's probably got a ban.
[01:24:02.401 --> 01:24:04.803]  Put out a bunch of like 30,000 Hillary emails.
[01:24:06.747 --> 01:24:11.590]  And, and of course it was four years old, but the Q people went crazy.
[01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:14.972]  They went through it and, and, and we're, and we're like putting it out.
[01:24:14.972 --> 01:24:16.473]  So that was a good thing.
[01:24:16.473 --> 01:24:20.375]  It's just be aware of what you're involved in, understand what you're involved in.
[01:24:20.375 --> 01:24:21.316]  And that's all I'm saying.
[01:24:21.316 --> 01:24:28.100]  Cause when I'm about to jump off, you know, a hundred foot cliff into a river, I don't, if it's murky and brown water, I've never jumped in before.
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:28.981]  I don't do it.
[01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:29.901]  It's crystal clear water.
[01:24:29.901 --> 01:24:32.062]  And I've already swam around down there and know it's safe.
[01:24:32.062 --> 01:24:32.663]  I'm going to jump in.
[01:24:33.646 --> 01:24:35.648]  But I'm not going to do it if I can't see the bottom.
[01:24:35.648 --> 01:24:37.750]  And all I'm saying is, InfoWars, you can see the bottom.
[01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:41.033]  And I'm not in competition with Q. I want to defeat the globalists.
[01:24:41.033 --> 01:24:42.875]  I want to see people get big and successful.
[01:24:42.875 --> 01:24:44.797]  I want to defeat the New World Order.
[01:24:44.797 --> 01:24:52.404]  It's just that that's where I was with Q. But now, you notice I said I think Q's good, because we've taken it back over, and it's now been banned.
[01:24:52.404 --> 01:24:58.109]  An InfoWars.com article, ex-colleague sees Durham dropping bombshells before Labor Day.
[01:25:00.196 --> 01:25:03.457]  You see a lot of discrediting congressional hearings about Durham going on.
[01:25:03.457 --> 01:25:06.659]  That leans towards that actually happening, but I wouldn't hold your breath, folks.
[01:25:06.659 --> 01:25:15.262]  What we do need is for Q, followers, and others to get into the original WikiLeaks and to go through them and just research them and see them.
[01:25:15.262 --> 01:25:16.903]  The ultimate breadcrumbs are right there.
[01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:19.123]  That's what needs to happen.
[01:25:19.123 --> 01:25:28.147]  Germany introduces mandatory coronavirus testing for travelers, continues lockdowns after 1,400,000 march in Berlin against the ongoing lockdown.
[01:25:29.892 --> 01:25:31.953]  Meanwhile, I've never had an RV, but I like to rent them.
[01:25:31.953 --> 01:25:37.536]  And I remember back when COVID started, I said, if this lockdown continues, all the RVs in the country will sell out.
[01:25:37.536 --> 01:25:38.076]  That's happened.
[01:25:52.816 --> 01:25:56.398]  Meet the RVs that are literally driving our country's GDP.
[01:25:56.398 --> 01:26:02.381]  It's the only part of the GDP growing, and that's people getting off the grid in mobile vehicles.
[01:26:02.381 --> 01:26:04.682]  And I tell you, it really is the future.
[01:26:04.682 --> 01:26:09.984]  With all the tyranny and the contact tracers and the bureaucracy and the out-of-control stuff, it is the future.
[01:26:09.984 --> 01:26:16.708]  That's why you've got to really protect your identity and make sure the high-tech tracking that's in a lot of these new vehicles is turned off or removed.
[01:26:18.007 --> 01:26:24.613]  Because it's not that you've done something wrong, it's that the globalists are using your location to control you and rob you and run your life.
[01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:29.558]  And speaking of that, we have it in four different colors.
[01:26:29.558 --> 01:26:33.802]  It is the best Faraday cage that you're going to find out there.
[01:26:33.802 --> 01:26:35.584]  The older generations were much thicker and much bigger.
[01:26:35.584 --> 01:26:38.066]  It takes small phones, it takes big phones.
[01:26:38.066 --> 01:26:39.868]  You slip it into the little Faraday cage.
[01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:49.698]  And now the hackers, the trackers, the Clintons, the bureaucrats, the pedophile controllers, they can't track you and your family.
[01:26:49.698 --> 01:26:52.841]  And it also reminds you how powerful these phones are and what they can do.
[01:26:52.841 --> 01:27:02.108]  When Ghislaine Maxwell got grabbed, you know, there in the middle of the East Coast forest, she had tinfoil wrapped around her cell phones.
[01:27:02.108 --> 01:27:04.110]  That's because they act as Faraday cages.
[01:27:04.110 --> 01:27:05.291]  These are $19.95.
[01:27:05.291 --> 01:27:06.492]  It's a great deal.
[01:27:06.492 --> 01:27:08.634]  Infowarsstore.com, and that's what funds
[01:27:10.017 --> 01:27:12.779]  Our operation, they cost us $11 and change.
[01:27:12.779 --> 01:27:16.240]  We used to sell these big unwieldy ones that have like a 98% rate.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.821]  These are 99% rate.
[01:27:17.821 --> 01:27:23.484]  If you're right by a cell tower, they're so powerful, they can still sometimes beam through and ping your phone and get your data.
[01:27:23.484 --> 01:27:26.626]  They're not just getting your location, and they're sharing with all these other big firms.
[01:27:26.626 --> 01:27:30.208]  We have it in green, black, blue, and red.
[01:27:30.208 --> 01:27:31.969]  Also, it makes a great gift.
[01:27:31.969 --> 01:27:36.291]  I got to tell you, we got to sell a lot of privacy pockets to fund this operation.
[01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:36.552]  Also,
[01:27:37.498 --> 01:27:39.199]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:27:39.199 --> 01:27:42.660]  We have the Reopen America Back to School Special.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:46.481]  50 to 60% off on our best-selling supplements.
[01:27:46.481 --> 01:27:48.562]  Double Patriot points for your next order.
[01:27:48.562 --> 01:27:50.442]  That means X2, that means X3.
[01:27:50.442 --> 01:27:55.144]  Our new turmeric liquid concentrate formula that does not compete with bodies.
[01:27:55.144 --> 01:27:57.265]  It's a concentrated curcuminoid.
[01:27:57.265 --> 01:28:00.186]  This is a concentrated liquid raw turmeric.
[01:28:00.186 --> 01:28:00.946]  They go together.
[01:28:02.546 --> 01:28:05.970]  It is the highest quality you're going to find anywhere.
[01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:07.111]  25% off.
[01:28:07.111 --> 01:28:10.194]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:28:10.194 --> 01:28:11.836]  All of the products are 50 to 60% off.
[01:28:11.836 --> 01:28:13.878]  We're going to have to end those specials.
[01:28:13.878 --> 01:28:16.501]  Already had to end the free shipping because we did the math.
[01:28:16.501 --> 01:28:18.523]  The gross sales were amazing.
[01:28:18.523 --> 01:28:21.246]  But when you took the shipping onto it, we were losing money in some areas.
[01:28:21.246 --> 01:28:22.388]  We just have to fund ourselves.
[01:28:22.388 --> 01:28:23.128]  We also have the
[01:28:24.588 --> 01:28:34.351]  Mouthwash and toothpaste that are very innovative, highest quality, enamel safe, pure, not cheap, activated charcoal, with a bunch of essential oils.
[01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:36.352]  That is an amazing toothpaste.
[01:28:36.352 --> 01:28:39.573]  We have the toothpaste and the mouthwash at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:28:39.573 --> 01:28:40.693]  And again, it funds our operation.
[01:28:40.693 --> 01:28:44.035]  But I would encourage you, if you haven't tried the toothpaste, order some today.
[01:28:44.035 --> 01:28:45.455]  Order some tonight.
[01:28:45.455 --> 01:28:50.137]  And for those of you that are middle class or wealthy, buy extra as gifts for family.
[01:28:50.137 --> 01:28:50.797]  Buy the new
[01:28:52.082 --> 01:28:55.704]  American Eagle, Betsy Ross flag t-shirts in two designs.
[01:28:55.704 --> 01:28:57.646]  It's not a copy.
[01:28:57.646 --> 01:28:59.847]  It's better than what the Trump campaign came out with.
[01:28:59.847 --> 01:29:01.248]  They called those Nazi.
[01:29:01.248 --> 01:29:03.630]  They called those evil a month ago.
[01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:06.111]  So I said, let's make our own beautiful American Eagle flag shirt.
[01:29:06.111 --> 01:29:07.272]  We were already planning it.
[01:29:07.272 --> 01:29:09.093]  But that spurred me to do it.
[01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:11.795]  It's got an American Eagle on the left-hand shoulder.
[01:29:11.795 --> 01:29:13.316]  Usually they do it on the right-hand shoulder.
[01:29:13.316 --> 01:29:14.157]  This one's probably on the left hand.
[01:29:14.157 --> 01:29:14.417]  Whatever.
[01:29:14.417 --> 01:29:17.038]  It's a limited edition.
[01:29:17.038 --> 01:29:19.020]  It's got the 20 stars around the eagle.
[01:29:20.094 --> 01:29:23.436]  With the Betsy Ross flag, or it's got the eagle bigger without the stars.
[01:29:23.436 --> 01:29:30.500]  Those two different versions at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:35.283]  And it is the way that you support the broadcast, but also have a beautiful election t-shirt.
[01:29:35.283 --> 01:29:39.626]  Because if you click on the back, it says InfoWars.com.
[01:29:39.626 --> 01:29:41.307]  Keep America Great!
[01:29:42.489 --> 01:29:44.009]  So you want to meet like-minded people.
[01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:46.290]  You want to spread the word in red areas.
[01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:47.570]  You might get your lunch bought for you.
[01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:49.531]  You might meet your future husband or wife.
[01:29:49.531 --> 01:29:50.511]  You might meet a new friend.
[01:29:50.511 --> 01:29:54.352]  I mean, you're going to really turn a lot of heads and meet a lot of people.
[01:29:54.352 --> 01:29:55.052]  It's very fun.
[01:29:55.052 --> 01:29:55.732]  You spread the word.
[01:29:55.732 --> 01:29:58.432]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:29:58.432 --> 01:30:01.473]  But if you're in a blue area and they see that info wars, look out.
[01:30:01.473 --> 01:30:03.434]  They may try to hit you in the head with a hammer.
[01:30:03.434 --> 01:30:09.355]  So it's definitely a big deal to wear an eye-catching triggering shirt like this.
[01:30:09.355 --> 01:30:09.635]  Okay.
[01:30:11.874 --> 01:30:17.619]  Like I said, I'll be back tomorrow, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:30:17.619 --> 01:30:18.019]  Central.
[01:30:18.019 --> 01:30:23.624]  We're going to re-air this as soon as these three special reports on Antifa is not a myth.
[01:30:23.624 --> 01:30:25.145]  John Bowne usually does five-minute reports.
[01:30:25.145 --> 01:30:26.846]  This one's nine minutes.
[01:30:26.846 --> 01:30:33.572]  And then first, I've got a report on Democrats announce COVID-19 tracing for all Americans and begin rolling out the apps.
[01:30:33.572 --> 01:30:35.413]  It ties into what I was just covering.
[01:30:35.413 --> 01:30:37.735]  And then is economic collapse imminent?
[01:30:37.735 --> 01:30:39.236]  What will you do?
[01:30:39.236 --> 01:30:40.778]  And just remember in all of this,
[01:30:42.717 --> 01:30:43.817]  Of course it's fiat.
[01:30:43.817 --> 01:30:44.818]  Of course it's ballooned.
[01:30:44.818 --> 01:30:46.718]  Of course big banks stole most of the money.
[01:30:46.718 --> 01:30:54.540]  Now Trump's doing another stimulus directly to you because he learned that they bypassed the common people even though the law said it went to common people first.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:57.641]  The globe was running it made sure the computers and the servers wouldn't let you get in.
[01:30:57.641 --> 01:30:59.021]  People tried for weeks to do it.
[01:30:59.021 --> 01:31:02.442]  So Trump's about to sign an executive order tonight that we put that on screen.
[01:31:02.442 --> 01:31:04.483]  You guys gave it to me and I lost the article.
[01:31:04.483 --> 01:31:05.743]  With direct money to the people.
[01:31:05.743 --> 01:31:06.863]  It's still dangerous.
[01:31:06.863 --> 01:31:10.064]  But we're against China and against the EU and others.
[01:31:11.325 --> 01:31:13.565]  They're all doing it.
[01:31:13.565 --> 01:31:18.947]  And so if they end up being the main currency because more people adopt it, then all we are is fiat.
[01:31:18.947 --> 01:31:21.167]  If you're going to be fiat, you got to be king.
[01:31:21.167 --> 01:31:22.427]  Venezuela had fiat.
[01:31:22.427 --> 01:31:24.988]  They're not king because nobody picked it up.
[01:31:24.988 --> 01:31:30.169]  Zimbabwe, you know, $20 million to get a sandwich because it was only Zimbabwe.
[01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:32.090]  It was only one African country.
[01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:36.230]  If you can have a fiat currency, everybody believes in it for a while.
[01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:38.571]  It's still bad, but put that headline back up on screen for me, please.
[01:31:40.325 --> 01:31:41.186]  From Fox News, please.
[01:31:41.186 --> 01:31:41.747]  There it is.
[01:31:41.747 --> 01:31:47.132]  Trump signed controversial relief executive orders Saturday to help unemployed Americans and others.
[01:31:47.132 --> 01:31:54.280]  I was reading the article when I had it here in my stack of hundreds of articles, and it said, direct checks to the American people.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.942]  And again, as bad as that is, the Democrats, the U.N.
[01:31:56.942 --> 01:31:58.204]  created the hoax.
[01:31:58.204 --> 01:32:00.065]  They put us in the cardiac arrest.
[01:32:00.065 --> 01:32:01.187]  They panicked everything.
[01:32:03.086 --> 01:32:07.428]  To put us into a stall like the Soviets did, the Communists did when they took over Russia in 1917.
[01:32:07.428 --> 01:32:14.730]  They put them into a depression for a few years to make them come beg on their knees to be permanently put on welfare.
[01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:17.351]  Trump wants it directly to keep small businesses going.
[01:32:17.351 --> 01:32:18.652]  He wants to reopen the economy.
[01:32:18.652 --> 01:32:20.272]  He never wanted to close it.
[01:32:20.272 --> 01:32:21.313]  He got bullied into it.
[01:32:21.313 --> 01:32:22.473]  People said he wasn't going to respond.
[01:32:22.473 --> 01:32:23.593]  He was going to get blamed.
[01:32:23.593 --> 01:32:27.095]  I kind of bought into that at first, realized the bigger picture later.
[01:32:27.095 --> 01:32:29.656]  It's just an incredible time that we see unfolding.
[01:32:29.656 --> 01:32:30.076]  So as I
[01:32:30.876 --> 01:32:33.738]  Close out before these three critical reports that are so powerful.
[01:32:33.738 --> 01:32:35.759]  I want you to see them and share the live links.
[01:32:35.759 --> 01:32:37.120]  Pray for President Trump.
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:37.881]  Pray for the world.
[01:32:37.881 --> 01:32:39.022]  Pray for justice.
[01:32:39.022 --> 01:32:48.748]  Pray for the children abused by these satanic covens that use them as a blood sacrifice currency to Satan and use them as a blackmail system to bring down the Western world and the rest of the planet.
[01:32:48.748 --> 01:32:52.011]  And pray for a global awakening together in the name of Jesus.
[01:32:52.930 --> 01:33:06.801]  Because it is a spiritual fight, as General Flynn said, and please go to InfoWars.com and get the General Flynn letter about how we're fighting evil and how it's satanic, so we can turn the tide against this together.
[01:33:06.801 --> 01:33:11.724]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:33:11.724 --> 01:33:14.767]  Give the couple hundred thousand people, so that we can tell what's watching,
[01:33:15.447 --> 01:33:18.648]  Couple hundred, two hundred and something thousand are watching the streams right now, okay?
[01:33:18.648 --> 01:33:21.709]  And we're on satellite and TV and all of it, who knows how many there.
[01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:31.332]  If all of you call somebody right now and say, powerful two hours, just watched it, special reports now, InfoWars.com forward slash show, banned out video.
[01:33:31.332 --> 01:33:39.594]  If you send that link for the live Saturday show, Trump warns of new coup attempt and say, open this up, it's happening right now, it will change the world.
[01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.215]  Because then $200,000 is $400,000.
[01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:43.396]  And then $400,000 is $800,000.
[01:33:43.396 --> 01:33:47.378]  And then $800,000, you get the math.
[01:33:47.378 --> 01:33:48.439]  You understand.
[01:33:48.439 --> 01:33:53.341]  It's up to you whether you want to let them win or whether you want to stand up and humanity win.
[01:33:53.341 --> 01:33:53.802]  God bless you.
[01:33:53.802 --> 01:33:54.402]  I want to thank the crew.
[01:34:10.422 --> 01:34:15.206]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:34:15.206 --> 01:34:24.854]  It is very important that InfoWars and yours truly Alex Jones not get credit for being right.
[01:34:24.854 --> 01:34:32.701]  Because when people continue to believe that I magically know what's coming next and I'm a prophet, we lose.
[01:34:32.701 --> 01:34:35.063]  That's not what's happening.
[01:34:35.063 --> 01:34:35.263]  If I
[01:34:35.908 --> 01:34:42.954]  Read the newspaper and it tells me that William Shatner is coming to town and I can buy tickets in a month to go see him.
[01:34:42.954 --> 01:34:52.621]  I'm not a prophet for knowing William Shatner is going to show up on a certain date like the time 15 years ago I saw in the paper and bought tickets for my wife and I. I read it in the paper.
[01:34:52.621 --> 01:34:54.543]  I knew William Shatner was coming.
[01:34:54.543 --> 01:34:55.884]  I paid my hundred bucks.
[01:34:55.884 --> 01:34:59.587]  I went and saw William Shatner.
[01:34:59.587 --> 01:35:04.150]  The reason we know the whole COVID thing is staged is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:35:04.150 --> 01:35:04.731]  I'm getting chills.
[01:35:05.822 --> 01:35:18.389]  In 2010, and then the Bill Gates Foundation in 2019, war-gamed and drilled two events out of more than a hundred that I don't have time to mention here.
[01:35:18.389 --> 01:35:24.912]  Lockstep in 2010, Event 201 in 2019.
[01:35:24.912 --> 01:35:34.878]  And in it, they laid out how there'll be a global pandemic, it'll bring in global government, the WHO will be made the authority of the planet, and then they will have contact tracing everywhere
[01:35:35.711 --> 01:35:54.516]  with a global bureaucracy that trains us to accept their control and that we would then have apps on our phones that track us in real time and control social distancing and that then we'll control whether we can fly or then have a job or go to a store or leave our houses.
[01:35:54.516 --> 01:35:56.897]  And they talk about how it's a global authoritarianism
[01:35:57.776 --> 01:36:02.637]  But how it's good for us, and how they're going to put the pressure on, then release it.
[01:36:02.637 --> 01:36:04.298]  Put the pressure on, release it.
[01:36:04.298 --> 01:36:07.299]  But still, tighten down each time.
[01:36:07.299 --> 01:36:09.560]  So that's how I told you 6-7 months ago when this started.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.780]  They'll tighten down, they'll release.
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.661]  They'll tighten down even more, they'll release.
[01:36:14.661 --> 01:36:16.262]  And now that's what they're doing.
[01:36:16.262 --> 01:36:18.662]  Because it's all wargamed out.
[01:36:18.662 --> 01:36:20.243]  It's all a program.
[01:36:20.243 --> 01:36:21.023]  It's an agenda.
[01:36:22.225 --> 01:36:32.134]  And they are using tests that even the New York Times reported back in 2007 and 2010 with headlines like the pandemic that wasn't.
[01:36:32.134 --> 01:36:46.526]  That these type of tests for the flu and for coronavirus are almost always false positive because if you have any of the detritus of already having an infection in the last decade or so of the flu or of corona, you're going to show that you're positive.
[01:36:47.608 --> 01:36:50.289]  So again, they admit it's all fraud.
[01:36:50.289 --> 01:36:51.729]  They admit it's all a scam.
[01:36:51.729 --> 01:36:54.350]  It wasn't 2.5 million or 2.2 million that died.
[01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:57.771]  It's 150,000 and almost all of those are people that died of other things.
[01:36:57.771 --> 01:37:04.994]  But still we're told, sorry, we're going to turn your water and your power off in California if you have a party.
[01:37:04.994 --> 01:37:11.896]  Oh, sorry, CNN says, just like we wear seatbelts, America will submit to wearing masks at all times, including
[01:37:13.266 --> 01:37:15.867]  In your house, this is a dystopia.
[01:37:15.867 --> 01:37:20.128]  We talk about Islam making women wear things up with their mask as an act of power and domination.
[01:37:20.128 --> 01:37:21.048]  That's all this is.
[01:37:21.048 --> 01:37:25.529]  And Fauci says it's about training you to submit to science.
[01:37:25.529 --> 01:37:27.410]  Except he's been wrong.
[01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:31.551]  He's lied about everything he said at every point and every level.
[01:37:31.551 --> 01:37:39.933]  And he's set with Bill Melinda Gates at the UN level, at the WHO, who is in control and who is running the entire show.
[01:37:41.325 --> 01:37:50.652]  They create the directives, those directives come down to us, and then they have corporations in blue cities and blue states implement it, regardless of what the federal government does.
[01:37:50.652 --> 01:37:54.715]  And when the feds don't do everything they want, they say, oh, you've caused the death.
[01:37:54.715 --> 01:37:56.497]  And again, all of that based on fraud.
[01:37:56.497 --> 01:38:04.463]  And then Fauci throws the opening pitch at a Major League Baseball game, and throws it way into left field, the worst you've ever seen, and they even praise that.
[01:38:04.463 --> 01:38:05.704]  Because criticism of him
[01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:07.531]  Is he legal?
[01:38:07.531 --> 01:38:15.258]  When Trump tweets out the truth about hydroxychloroquine or anything else, they ban the president now because Fauci and the UN are our gods.
[01:38:15.258 --> 01:38:26.228]  About a week ago, Gateway Pundit reported on a public operation between the federal government and Yale testing 15 different systems to brainwash you and make you submit.
[01:38:26.228 --> 01:38:32.114]  But they've already found in a study the best way is shaming you and saying you're going to make other people sick if you don't wear the mask.
[01:38:32.774 --> 01:38:39.197]  And they also talk about telling you that you're a hero when you wear the mask and other things to manipulate you.
[01:38:39.197 --> 01:38:41.418]  And again, it's all based on fraud.
[01:38:41.418 --> 01:38:44.980]  The M95 mask only protects air coming in, not out.
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:46.401]  It's totally unfiltered.
[01:38:46.401 --> 01:38:48.022]  But that's a fraud to begin with.
[01:38:48.022 --> 01:38:52.064]  Top scientists in Holland and Sweden have come out and said it's a total fraud.
[01:38:52.064 --> 01:38:52.904]  It doesn't protect people.
[01:38:53.266 --> 01:39:09.315]  Again, it's an active submission preparing you for the global social credit score that they're going to use that's tied to this new medical ID app that's already on all the droids and all the iPhones and the two companies are working together to bring forward this system and force you onto it.
[01:39:09.995 --> 01:39:31.082]  Already, Virginia, California and other states are taking the federal dollars that Congress has given them and putting out apps that they're making government employees and big corporate employees all use to monitor their distance from others and to monitor who they've been around so they can then be made suspect when somebody has a false positive COVID test.
[01:39:31.082 --> 01:39:38.065]  They also follow the NIH and UN directive in Virginia and even Texas, now it's the majority of states, that if one person has COVID-19,
[01:39:39.412 --> 01:39:42.353]  One person tests positive, most of the time false.
[01:39:42.353 --> 01:39:45.154]  Fifteen around them are then told they have it.
[01:39:45.154 --> 01:39:49.516]  That's why people who have never been in a clinic or never been tested are being told they have COVID-19.
[01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:51.437]  And again, the fraud is all admitted.
[01:39:51.437 --> 01:39:54.218]  They call it a metric or a formulae.
[01:39:54.218 --> 01:39:56.739]  What it is, is smoke and mirrors and a lie.
[01:39:56.739 --> 01:39:59.340]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we have to speak out against this.
[01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:00.500]  We have to say no to this.
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:03.041]  And we have to become conscious of it and warn others.
[01:40:03.041 --> 01:40:06.523]  But there's a very exciting phenomenon taking place right now.
[01:40:07.981 --> 01:40:23.088]  Denise Richards and all these other so-called Hollywood stars are now tweeting and Facebooking about how they use Faraday cage pouches to put around their phones so they can't be tracked by the government, by contact tracers, and of course by stalkers, by hackers, you name it.
[01:40:23.088 --> 01:40:25.729]  And a lot of the general public is getting really excited.
[01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:29.151]  We've been selling privacy pockets for more than 10 years.
[01:40:29.151 --> 01:40:34.073]  Little Faraday cages that you put your phone in and then the cell towers can't ping it and you can't be tracked.
[01:40:34.073 --> 01:40:35.454]  It's just a good basic thing to do
[01:40:35.914 --> 01:40:42.900]  To protect your privacy, but also to train yourself to realize that this phone is a Trojan horse of the globalist.
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:51.447]  It has a lot of good uses, but it is a system designed to track, control, and trace us, and bring in the global social credit score that's already been war-gamed in China.
[01:40:51.447 --> 01:40:53.368]  We normally sold a couple hundred of these a month.
[01:40:53.368 --> 01:41:01.295]  We're selling a thousand a day of these on average, because people really get it, and they're wanting to educate others.
[01:41:01.295 --> 01:41:04.297]  They're buying, usually three or four of them to give to friends and family,
[01:41:04.557 --> 01:41:06.639]  And then educating people about this.
[01:41:06.639 --> 01:41:08.940]  So the public is really awake right now.
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:10.401]  They understand what's happening.
[01:41:10.401 --> 01:41:11.983]  This is just a stopgap measure.
[01:41:11.983 --> 01:41:15.786]  We need Congress to pass laws to outlaw this tracking, involuntary tracking.
[01:41:15.786 --> 01:41:20.389]  And we need to educate the public more about what's happening so that we can stop this system.
[01:41:20.829 --> 01:41:31.276]  This is how the global corporates plan to take full control of the planet and micromanage every facet of our lives and shut down all small businesses and farms and infrastructure they don't control.
[01:41:31.276 --> 01:41:34.238]  That's the admitted plan of this vertical integration.
[01:41:34.238 --> 01:41:36.580]  So research more of these facts at Band.Video.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:39.382]  Go to InfoWareStore.com and get your Privacy Pocket.
[01:41:39.602 --> 01:41:40.823]  They were the ones that lied!
[01:42:04.019 --> 01:42:06.782]  From A to Z about everything about coronavirus.
[01:42:06.782 --> 01:42:07.943]  They lied about the death toll.
[01:42:07.943 --> 01:42:09.825]  They lied about how they were doing the testing.
[01:42:09.825 --> 01:42:13.368]  They lied and counted people that died of gunshot wounds and car wrecks.
[01:42:13.368 --> 01:42:25.720]  And these same frauds that then own the patents on the very vaccines they're trying to force us to take, with incredible conflicts of interest, come out now and tell us that the whole world is collapsing in a planetary reset
[01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:33.896]  Not because they created all this fiat currency, not because they stole trillions of dollars, not because they created this huge bubble, but because of coronavirus.
[01:42:33.896 --> 01:42:43.764]  And I said six months ago, and so did our reporter Greg Reese, we'll play his report in a moment, that this was part of the great global reset that Deimos and others have been calling for.
[01:42:43.764 --> 01:42:46.086]  That way the establishment doesn't get the blame.
[01:42:46.391 --> 01:42:46.611]  Absolutely.
[01:43:07.554 --> 01:43:13.759]  With a police state and a surveillance tech grid with the contact tracers over the organized collapse.
[01:43:13.759 --> 01:43:19.484]  And so the people would accept having a permanent loss in their standard of living to lower their carbon.
[01:43:19.484 --> 01:43:21.406]  Well, now they've come out and admitted that.
[01:43:21.406 --> 01:43:26.170]  Michelle Obama has said COVID is going to help us re-engineer the world and redistribute wealth.
[01:43:26.170 --> 01:43:29.472]  And CNN and the New York Times have said, this is good for the earth.
[01:43:29.472 --> 01:43:31.254]  It's lowering our carbon footprint.
[01:43:31.254 --> 01:43:34.877]  But the richest people in the world are leftist and communist and socialist.
[01:43:35.976 --> 01:43:36.337]  I think?
[01:43:56.559 --> 01:44:04.506]  And authored and implemented by the globalist to bring in world government to put the United Nations WHO in charge.
[01:44:04.506 --> 01:44:12.993]  And now we see videos all over Europe and all over the US and the UK, Australia, where there'll be a woman not wearing a mask in a store and people walk up and say, you can't be here without a mask.
[01:44:12.993 --> 01:44:18.838]  The WHO says, and the woman's like, but local law says, if I have asthma or something, I'll have to wear it.
[01:44:18.838 --> 01:44:19.678]  He says, I don't care.
[01:44:19.678 --> 01:44:22.261]  The UN says, get out of here.
[01:44:22.261 --> 01:44:23.542]  So you wake up and you're under
[01:44:24.844 --> 01:44:25.645]  The United Nations.
[01:44:25.645 --> 01:44:27.266]  And it brings in the cashless society.
[01:44:27.266 --> 01:44:28.547]  They're refusing cash everywhere.
[01:44:28.547 --> 01:44:43.079]  And it allows them to surveil us and track us and control us with the Clinton Global Initiative running the worldwide tracking program that the taxpayer money by the billions is then forked over to them to make money while they track and trace and control our lives.
[01:44:44.482 --> 01:44:49.285]  Big Tech was always set up to destroy the freedom of the web and to consolidate power and to censor.
[01:44:49.285 --> 01:45:02.673]  And now that they've silenced almost everyone off the internet, they're moving forward now to silence hundreds of prominent doctors, virologists, epidemiologists, and other scientists that are exposing that the entire COVID-19 story is a lie.
[01:45:02.673 --> 01:45:07.216]  And now they're talking about arresting people that question Fauci and the United Nations.
[01:45:07.216 --> 01:45:11.679]  We've gone off the edge of the cliff into high-tech modern tyranny.
[01:45:11.679 --> 01:45:13.580]  And only being honest about it is going to stop it.
[01:45:14.272 --> 01:45:22.495]  Now the United States is seeing food prices massively spike because if there's a positive at a farm of COVID-19, they shut it down for a few weeks.
[01:45:22.495 --> 01:45:25.497]  If there's a positive at a warehouse, they shut it down for a few weeks.
[01:45:25.497 --> 01:45:28.858]  Even if people are asymptomatic in almost every case and not sick.
[01:45:28.858 --> 01:45:31.199]  China's been open for business the entire time.
[01:45:31.199 --> 01:45:33.420]  Only the United States is still locked down.
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:37.802]  Only the United States is told we're the bad guys because we've done a hundred times the testing of anybody else.
[01:45:38.362 --> 01:45:41.125]  And the tests again are almost all false positive.
[01:45:41.125 --> 01:45:42.386]  They were designed to be.
[01:45:42.386 --> 01:45:51.454]  This was cooked up in modern globalist warfare circles to bring down the nation state and bring down America and punish us for electing President Trump.
[01:45:51.454 --> 01:45:55.358]  And President Trump has dropped the ball stopping the coordinated racketeering of big tech
[01:45:55.638 --> 01:45:58.519]  We are under an existential threat to destroy our very existence.
[01:45:58.519 --> 01:46:05.443]  There's a letter that General Flynn put out yesterday that lays this out where he explains this is a spiritual war to bring down the United States and that this is clearly Satanism
[01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:24.931]  The United States is sliding rapidly into Venezuela.
[01:46:44.449 --> 01:46:45.309]  We're good.
[01:47:01.892 --> 01:47:05.073]  The United States is going because the globalists want to collapse us.
[01:47:05.073 --> 01:47:18.397]  They want to break us and they're starting with the blue cities and blue states, creating artificial depressions, putting out the fentanyl, advertising that you can be homeless and live on the street to destroy confidence and to collapse the entire United States.
[01:47:18.397 --> 01:47:20.318]  That's why they're wrecking things by design.
[01:47:20.318 --> 01:47:22.038]  That's why they're saying overthrow the police.
[01:47:22.038 --> 01:47:28.740]  That's why they're saying blow up the police stations officially in the city of Austin budget because they are overthrowing America.
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:30.321]  They are engaged in a takeover.
[01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:36.711]  In closing, I'll tell listeners this, and viewers, this is the most critical time in human history, not just U.S.
[01:47:36.711 --> 01:47:37.351]  history.
[01:47:37.351 --> 01:47:49.956]  Eighty days out from the election, you need to share the articles and the videos from BandOnVideo and NewsWorks.com and Infowars.com like your very life depends on it because it does, ladies and gentlemen, it does.
[01:47:51.562 --> 01:48:03.525]  And it is so important now, when people are so hungry, when everybody else is being silenced, to know that hundreds of doctors and others that have been silenced are all in the banned video section of Banned.Video, where you can see them.
[01:48:03.525 --> 01:48:07.186]  And many of them have millions of views, but they need to have tens of millions of views.
[01:48:07.186 --> 01:48:10.727]  And also, you need to support InfoWars so we can pay for the bandwidth.
[01:48:10.727 --> 01:48:20.489]  Buy a t-shirt, buy a book, buy a film, buy a privacy pocket at InfoWarsTore.com and help yourself and help us, because it takes money to fight this war.
[01:48:20.865 --> 01:48:23.559]  But whatever you do, pray for us and keep spreading the word and sharing the links.
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:32.464]  Because we are really hurting the globalists, and we're about 50-50 right now, at the brink, sudden death over time, in the Super Bowl for humanity's future.
[01:48:32.464 --> 01:48:42.509]  And again, we have storable food right now, with 3-4 week delivery, highest quality, in stock, the best packaging, last 25 years, at InfoWareStore.com, powered by my Patreon.
[01:48:42.509 --> 01:48:46.852]  And I'm telling you, the way the world's going, whether Trump gets elected or not, things are just going to get crazier.
[01:48:46.852 --> 01:48:53.615]  You need to have storable food for the future, so that you're not dependent on the system when things collapse, and when inflation comes in, because of what's unfolding.
[01:48:53.775 --> 01:48:58.577]  And if there's a successful plunge in the dollar, this country is going to look like Venezuela in six months.
[01:48:58.577 --> 01:49:00.898]  It won't take five years like Venezuela to get to that point.
[01:49:00.898 --> 01:49:13.304]  So I would suggest everyone go to MFulwarestore.com and get a three month, a six month, a year supply and hide that food and know it's got the best packaging and the highest quality and it lasts 25 years because you need firearms.
[01:49:13.304 --> 01:49:14.224]  You need to know how to use them.
[01:49:14.224 --> 01:49:16.045]  You need water filtration, air filtration.
[01:49:16.045 --> 01:49:17.606]  You need storable food.
[01:49:17.606 --> 01:49:19.647]  We have everything with the firearms at MFulwarestore.com.
[01:49:20.486 --> 01:49:21.990]  We have other survival accessories.
[01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:26.942]  All I'm just saying is get ready and get serious and talk to your neighborhood, talk to your neighbors, talk to your family.
[01:49:27.341 --> 01:49:29.242]  And have an emergency plan.
[01:49:29.242 --> 01:49:32.864]  None of us have a perfect emergency plan, but we've got to start looking at that.
[01:49:32.864 --> 01:49:39.228]  I've been so focused on fighting the Globalist offensively, I've never even gotten ready for my own personal self on my own device.
[01:49:39.228 --> 01:49:51.575]  Things have gotten so serious, I bought a little piece of land, about 30 miles, 35 miles outside Austin, and I'm putting in the well, and I'm putting in the trailer, and I'm getting it ready in case things totally collapse, ladies and gentlemen, so I can
[01:49:52.595 --> 01:49:54.439]  Basically evacuate if the power goes off.
[01:49:54.439 --> 01:50:01.090]  I mean, the New World Order, just like Larry Grafwold exposed, really plans to implode everything and end this country forever.
[01:50:01.638 --> 01:50:16.109]  Okay, they really plan to collapse things, turn off the food, turn off the water, and make you come and sue for peace, and get on your knees and turn in your guns, and take your implantable chip that Gates is proposing, and take your forced inoculation, and carry your little Obama phone, your 2.0, that tracks what you do.
[01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:16.829]  I mean, it's here.
[01:50:16.829 --> 01:50:17.990]  This is the dystopia.
[01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:19.591]  They've been preparing for it for decades.
[01:50:19.591 --> 01:50:21.393]  It's now collapsing into us.
[01:50:21.393 --> 01:50:22.874]  This is it.
[01:50:22.874 --> 01:50:25.836]  So get ready, and get prepared, and just remember that
[01:50:26.857 --> 01:50:30.720]  People are already having to sell their children to slavery all over the world just to be able to feed their other children.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:30.840]  Okay?
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.941]  You have to decide what child to sell them to sex slavery.
[01:50:32.941 --> 01:50:34.843]  That's in the news.
[01:50:34.843 --> 01:50:39.026]  It will become like that overnight here as well and it's so sad, it's so disgusting.
[01:50:39.026 --> 01:50:42.288]  And again, I'm just begging people to realize we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:50:42.288 --> 01:50:43.909]  We're not in a normal situation anymore.
[01:50:43.909 --> 01:50:47.151]  We're fighting existentially for our very existence.
[01:50:47.151 --> 01:50:49.113]  That's why they're causing race war to divide everybody.
[01:50:49.113 --> 01:50:50.934]  That's why they're causing economic war.
[01:50:50.934 --> 01:50:54.377]  It's why they're causing this total lockdown because we are under new old order attack.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:01.904]  And if American people aren't strong enough to admit that to themselves, Trump won't be strong enough to tell us the truth and really do what needs to be done.
[01:51:01.904 --> 01:51:03.025]  But this is it.
[01:51:03.025 --> 01:51:04.545]  Pray to God for guidance.
[01:51:04.545 --> 01:51:05.286]  God bless and good luck.
[01:51:08.314 --> 01:51:12.217]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract
[01:51:38.434 --> 01:51:39.035]  We're good to go!
