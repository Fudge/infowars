[00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:04.381]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:05.542]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:07.023]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:08.685]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[00:00:08.785 --> 00:00:09.786]  I want them shut down.
[00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.767]  I want them silenced.
[00:00:10.827 --> 00:00:11.507]  I want them muted.
[00:00:11.527 --> 00:00:13.449]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:14.390]  You kept us on air.
[00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.831]  We did the analysis first.
[00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:17.112]  It's now gone mainstream.
[00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:19.174]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:25.140]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.781]  You need to stop right now.
[00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:27.963]  And they're very, very serious.
[00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:30.466]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:31.648]  This is not gonna happen.
[00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:33.350]  So, they are moving out to destroy me.
[00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.233]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.976]  Save yourself, save the world.
[00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.157]  We're in this together.
[00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:40.218]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:41.920]  Communism's up here.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.043]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:47.264]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:49.006]  My children are right here!
[00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:51.468]  But I need money to fight a war!
[00:00:51.648 --> 00:00:52.749]  And I need word of mouth!
[00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:53.850]  And I need prayer!
[00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.971]  And I need action!
[00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:56.912]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.575]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:19.031]  Well, this is going to be an astounding live, teleprompter-free Sunday, September 6th, 2020 transmission.
[00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:20.072]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:22.432]  We are 57 days out from the election.
[00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.033]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:32.035]  If you're a radio listener, I have a three-inch tall stack here of the bottom falling out of the COVID-19 hoax.
[00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:42.792]  I have the World Bank saying COVID-19 has been around since at least 2018, and all the funding listing with Fauci and Gates and the Wuhan lab.
[00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.934]  Now, we already knew that, but this is incredible to have them admitting it.
[00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:52.239]  AP reports, UN says new polio outbreak in Sudan caused by oral vaccine.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.203]  Number one cause of polio death is the vaccine.
[00:01:56.803 --> 00:01:57.504]  That's AP.
[00:01:58.364 --> 00:02:00.286]  Now, we've known this forever, but this is incredible.
[00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:06.452]  It is all coming up bombshell after bombshell after bombshell.
[00:02:07.172 --> 00:02:14.414]  And now Facebook, Twitter, Google, all of them are blocking the World Bank links.
[00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:20.136]  And they're also linking Nature and New Scientist links.
[00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:22.936]  They are running scared.
[00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:27.378]  They have committed crimes that are incredible, hiding in plain view and trying to use them against us.
[00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:28.738]  I am just stunned right now.
[00:02:28.818 --> 00:02:28.998]  Okay.
[00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:44.055]  We're going to cover that second hour with a great researcher and great reporter from National File, Patrick Howley at Patrick National File.
[00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:46.016]  That is coming up.
[00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:53.819]  But I will, front and center when we come back, cover this stack just to go through the basics because this is too big.
[00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.540]  And then we'll dig into it next hour.
[00:02:57.341 --> 00:03:00.502]  Then, after the second segment, I'm going to hit the third segment.
[00:03:02.546 --> 00:03:05.267]  The most surreal information.
[00:03:05.447 --> 00:03:11.948]  We've got CNN and others saying it's fiery but mostly peaceful 2.0.
[00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:18.529]  We have them saying that throwing mom-off cocktails at police is a form of protest.
[00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.231]  And we have the media saying that if someone's trying to stab a police officer, they can't defend themselves.
[00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.051]  This is beginning beyond absurdist.
[00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:32.092]  And then a bunch of armed, crazy black supremacists
[00:03:33.743 --> 00:03:35.523]  Marching on the Kentucky Derby.
[00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:37.984]  We've got all of that footage.
[00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:52.408]  And we've got Black Lives Matter, this time not 90% white, about half black, so it is actually a black racist mob, going into a restaurant, overturning tables, throwing chairs at people, busting out the windows, and screaming, get out of here.
[00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:57.569]  And then just like Mars Attacks, like I always make that joke, saying, don't run.
[00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.190]  We are your friends.
[00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.330]  Nobody did anything to you.
[00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.051]  You don't need to run.
[00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:02.331]  You don't need to cry.
[00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:07.573]  Like when they shot the poor guy on the chest last week and he died, Black Lives Matter got over him and said, you're all right.
[00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:09.673]  You're doing all right.
[00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:10.654]  Get up.
[00:04:12.974 --> 00:04:17.316]  Oh, by the way, the scumbag that killed that poor gentleman out in Portland,
[00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:20.669]  Turns out they have the photos and video of him stalking him.
[00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.369]  He was peaceful.
[00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:29.555]  He was not hurting a person of color, as Michael Reinholdt lied and said.
[00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:31.476]  And he also said he was in the military.
[00:04:31.496 --> 00:04:32.277]  Of course, he's a liar!
[00:04:33.097 --> 00:04:36.019]  Looks like a meth-head, devil-worshipper, pedophile to me.
[00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:38.601]  A glow-in-the-dark.
[00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:43.685]  I always describe them as ghouls, because they don't just have white skin.
[00:04:45.714 --> 00:04:49.097]  I'm telling you, these people, when you get up close to them, have like green skin.
[00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:49.898]  You can see through it.
[00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:53.822]  It's very translucent.
[00:04:54.703 --> 00:05:00.268]  And even black people that go into this demonic craze, they kind of get like brownish green skin.
[00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.554]  Go to a, go to a, go have an anti-abortion rally, and they'll always show up, no matter what city you're in.
[00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.912]  And they'll have pentagrams on them and they'll tell you they love Satan.
[00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:14.253]  It's always the same thing.
[00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:17.374]  Over and over and over again.
[00:05:17.394 --> 00:05:24.258]  You know, every time I get in the studio, it's so dry with the air conditioners or whatever, it makes me cough.
[00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:33.022]  And when I forget to take my lung cleanse, it gets scratchy and I've got to go get my lung cleanse.
[00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.289]  Ah.
[00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.791]  Thank you, Lundklens.
[00:05:59.113 --> 00:06:00.697]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[00:06:00.817 --> 00:06:04.866]  Thank you for joining us on this live, Sunday, September 6th global transmission.
[00:06:05.608 --> 00:06:06.691]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:07.782 --> 00:06:09.003]  The quickening is here.
[00:06:09.523 --> 00:06:11.845]  The quickening of the quickening, 57 days out.
[00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:16.248]  Owen Schroyer is hosting a new show called Sunday Live.
[00:06:16.268 --> 00:06:18.630]  Only has six minutes of breaks an hour.
[00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.792]  Four minutes at the bottom, two minutes at the end of the hour.
[00:06:21.592 --> 00:06:25.295]  For our local TV and radio stations that want to pick it up, Owen is knocking it out of the park.
[00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:27.757]  So you get your local breaks, but we don't take any breaks.
[00:06:28.157 --> 00:06:30.139]  That is six to eight central.
[00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.421]  Saturday Live has also been launched.
[00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:34.042]  That is
[00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:36.138]  2 to 4 p.m.
[00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:36.699]  that I come in.
[00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:38.900]  We also do six minutes of breaks.
[00:06:39.361 --> 00:06:41.682]  You have this classic Sunday show I've been doing for 16 years.
[00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:45.465]  You've got the weekday show that I do from 11 a.m.
[00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:46.225]  to 3 p.m.
[00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.567]  Central and the other great InfoWars Network shows.
[00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:54.851]  You can find all the links in our affiliate page for the TV and radio satellites for stations in your area.
[00:06:55.111 --> 00:06:59.794]  If you don't have a station, you want to call those TV and radio stations and ask them to pick up the transmission.
[00:07:01.607 --> 00:07:03.688]  Okay, again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:03.728 --> 00:07:06.370]  Thank you so much for joining us here today.
[00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.111]  Where should we start?
[00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:09.372]  Where should we begin?
[00:07:10.752 --> 00:07:22.319]  Well, next segment, I'm gonna hit the main story that deals with the headline, that is the headline, that I know they're printing for me right now, of the show.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.261]  Every day at InfoWars.com, we do a show.
[00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:29.804]  We post an article that deals with the top story.
[00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:32.326]  And here it is, Sunday Live.
[00:07:33.227 --> 00:07:37.831]  Dimms vow not to accept election results if they lose.
[00:07:39.712 --> 00:07:42.014]  We're going to play that clip for you next segment.
[00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:47.559]  Now remember, I've been telling you that for 14 months because it was floating around in their academic circles.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.541]  But what are they going to do when they contest it?
[00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:51.882]  And what's going to happen?
[00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:53.984]  I'll tell you what's going to happen.
[00:07:54.004 --> 00:07:55.986]  Depending on
[00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:01.714]  What we do, coming up next segment.
[00:08:02.354 --> 00:08:10.319]  But this is like barreling towards an unstoppable force that hits the immovable object.
[00:08:10.359 --> 00:08:12.781]  This is going to be spectacular.
[00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:15.783]  And they've already told us what they're going to do in the academic papers.
[00:08:15.843 --> 00:08:19.085]  Now they haven't told you in the mainstream yet, but they're starting to.
[00:08:19.785 --> 00:08:26.109]  Secession, plunging the stock market, more economic terrorism, more stuff like COVID-19.
[00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:28.172]  That's coming up.
[00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:38.247]  And then after that segment, whether it's Dallas or whether it's Portland or whether it is the Kentucky Derby in Louisville or
[00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:58.724]  Whether it is Rochester, New York, or New York, or whether it is Chicago, racial attacks on white people, just vicious murder attacks, shootings, stabbings, just bricks upside the head, women being stabbed in the throat, all because they're white and the media is saying it is a wonderful good thing.
[00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.406]  The Democratic Party we know is the party of racial attacks and of the KKK.
[00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:05.328]  And they've just flipped it around now onto white people.
[00:09:05.428 --> 00:09:07.490]  It's really a nightmarish situation.
[00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.494]  And we've got video of them throwing Molotov cocktails at police and getting themselves caught on fire.
[00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:14.975]  We've got so much more.
[00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:21.520]  It is all coming up at 33 After.
[00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:28.445]  Incredible footage of hundreds of armed black supremacists marching on the
[00:09:29.744 --> 00:09:31.666]  Kentucky Derby, threatening people.
[00:09:32.707 --> 00:09:42.098]  This is all being funded by the Globalists to try to trigger a race war, to distract us from the multinational banks and the CHICOMs that are trying to destroy the dollar and sink the country for all of us.
[00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:43.559]  They're trying to sink the ship.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.021]  This is absolute folly.
[00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:46.703]  This is absolute madness.
[00:09:47.183 --> 00:09:48.064]  That is all coming up.
[00:09:48.104 --> 00:09:50.707]  But let me just run through this stat for you now.
[00:09:51.488 --> 00:09:54.230]  Because this is something we can really do something about.
[00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:00.593]  And then we're going to have a special guest investigative journalist that's been reporting on this joining us in the next hour.
[00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:03.995]  The story's on Infowars.com.
[00:10:05.816 --> 00:10:06.737]  It's very, very important.
[00:10:08.438 --> 00:10:09.579]  Here's the Associated Press.
[00:10:10.808 --> 00:10:14.850]  UN says new polio outbreak in Sudan caused by oral vaccine.
[00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:17.392]  That is a big deal to have them admit what we know.
[00:10:17.952 --> 00:10:19.793]  My grandmother got polio from the vaccine.
[00:10:19.873 --> 00:10:20.354]  How do we know?
[00:10:20.734 --> 00:10:22.515]  The doctor told her in the 1950s.
[00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:25.657]  She was in a wheelchair for the rest of her life in incredible pain.
[00:10:26.017 --> 00:10:26.938]  Died at 92.
[00:10:26.978 --> 00:10:28.999]  Reuters.
[00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:33.081]  Coronavirus traces found in March of 2019 sewage sample.
[00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:34.762]  Spanish study shows.
[00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:37.424]  It's been out for years, folks.
[00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:40.007]  Let's see, it is an artificial virus.
[00:10:40.027 --> 00:10:41.068]  Bill Gates had it created.
[00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.750]  Here's the big one.
[00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:48.374]  World Bank Records COVID-19 test kits exported in 2018.
[00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:49.555]  You guessed it.
[00:10:50.236 --> 00:10:54.480]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded groups doing COVID testing on the public.
[00:10:55.532 --> 00:10:57.474]  And testing what they were going to launch in the future.
[00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:10.749]  And here's all the World Bank documents and World Integrated Trade Solution page detailing all of that with the COVID-19 virus produced by Fauci and Bill Gates in Wuhan because it was illegal to produce in the United States.
[00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:13.271]  Don't just believe me, let me show you mainstream news.
[00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:14.933]  This is
[00:11:16.098 --> 00:11:16.578]  Newsweek.
[00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:19.880]  Dr. Fauci bat-controversial Wuhan lab with U.S.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.184]  dollars for risky coronavirus research with an exact virus that looks just like COVID-19.
[00:11:26.864 --> 00:11:29.966]  This is five years before that.
[00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:31.266]  The Scientist.
[00:11:31.346 --> 00:11:32.967]  Lab-made coronavirus triggers debate.
[00:11:33.428 --> 00:11:39.231]  SARS-like coronavirus with a SARS-COVID mix, which is exactly what we have now with gain-of-function.
[00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:40.411]  New Scientist.
[00:11:41.252 --> 00:11:41.812]  Here's another one.
[00:11:41.832 --> 00:11:44.574]  Engineered bat virus stirs debate over risky
[00:11:45.612 --> 00:11:48.014]  Research by the Journal of Nature.
[00:11:48.715 --> 00:11:52.077]  And it gets into who was producing it and who was funding it, you bet.
[00:11:52.898 --> 00:11:57.442]  Bill Gates and Fauci running illegal research in the Wuhan lab.
[00:11:57.462 --> 00:11:59.664]  Here it is from the NIH website.
[00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:02.947]  COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation.
[00:12:03.908 --> 00:12:09.395]  New coronavirus emerges from bats in China, devastates young swine two years ago.
[00:12:09.956 --> 00:12:12.580]  They fed it then at Wuhan to other piglets.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.306]  Piglets that died were then ground up and they would extract the virus from them.
[00:12:17.566 --> 00:12:18.508]  Who ran the operation?
[00:12:18.528 --> 00:12:19.389]  Dr. Fauci.
[00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:25.350]  Continuing here, we've only got through an inch of the stack.
[00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.730]  There's at least two inches left here.
[00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:31.033]  How China's bat woman hunted down viruses for SARS to the new coronavirus.
[00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:36.576]  That was in June of 2020, but what they don't tell you here is it was all under Fauci and Bill Gates.
[00:12:37.777 --> 00:12:38.297]  Here's another one.
[00:12:39.698 --> 00:12:46.182]  Difference in receptor uses between severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and SARS-like coronavirus of bat origin.
[00:12:46.202 --> 00:12:48.023]  Before they called it COVID-19, several
[00:12:50.168 --> 00:13:01.070]  Decade plus ago, 13 years ago, 2007, they found it had a better gain of function, which they then souped up even more giving it the HIV receptor site delivery system.
[00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.111]  That's mainstream news.
[00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:03.171]  Oh, look!
[00:13:04.011 --> 00:13:05.111]  This is Patrick Howley.
[00:13:05.131 --> 00:13:06.391]  He's the reporter joining us next hour.
[00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:06.871]  Busted!
[00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:10.692]  NIH owns financial stake in Gates-funded coronavirus vaccine.
[00:13:11.152 --> 00:13:13.253]  So does Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci.
[00:13:13.713 --> 00:13:13.893]  Hmm.
[00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:22.433]  Bill Gates confronted on CBS News about widespread vaccine side effects, where they admit 20% go to the hospital, 80% get very ill.
[00:13:23.954 --> 00:13:35.420]  Then we've got the European patent specification for humans and animals for the exact virus sequence coding of the original COVID-19 by subsidiaries of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:13:37.661 --> 00:13:40.943]  Oh, I get TV viewers can see all of this for yourselves.
[00:13:42.813 --> 00:13:46.814]  COVID-19 tracking bracelets and invisible tattoos to monitor Americans.
[00:13:46.894 --> 00:13:48.695]  Bets Bill Gates in March proposing it.
[00:13:48.755 --> 00:13:49.415]  Now it's official.
[00:13:49.755 --> 00:13:50.476]  They're pushing it.
[00:13:51.076 --> 00:13:58.818]  And more and more documents all about the patents he's got on COVID-19 style viruses.
[00:13:58.858 --> 00:14:01.099]  He loves you so, so much.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.121]  Bill Gates funds quarantine research on how to lock you up going back over 20 years.
[00:14:06.501 --> 00:14:09.402]  Bill Gates says Indian pharma industry soon will be able to produce it.
[00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.413]  Bill Gates' Reuters reports bought up the entire vaccine control system worldwide.
[00:14:17.994 --> 00:14:19.595]  Then I've got all these articles.
[00:14:19.635 --> 00:14:29.282]  Here's the UN website about circulating vaccine-derived polio type in Sudan giving all those Africans polio, killing them and sterilizing them.
[00:14:29.302 --> 00:14:30.282]  That's what I showed you earlier.
[00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:32.844]  Ethiopia destroyed by the Bill Gates vaccine.
[00:14:33.124 --> 00:14:33.945]  That's the UN website.
[00:14:33.965 --> 00:14:34.505]  I won't even hide it.
[00:14:35.045 --> 00:14:37.267]  Pakistan destroyed by it.
[00:14:38.648 --> 00:14:39.869]  Just on and on and on.
[00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:47.729]  And there's another, UN says new polio outbreak should Sudan caused by oral vaccine funded by Bill Gates.
[00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.952]  And then we get into all the latest fake news they're putting out.
[00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:56.975]  Woman who died six months ago suddenly test positive for COVID-19.
[00:14:57.015 --> 00:15:01.958]  They're just scraping names of people that are dead they know won't complain and saying they had COVID to jack up numbers.
[00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:09.983]  Fox News Judge Jeanine confirms what we in the Gateway Pundit reported weeks ago that 90 plus percent of COVID-19 tests are false positives and fake.
[00:15:10.947 --> 00:15:11.527]  It doesn't matter.
[00:15:11.567 --> 00:15:13.848]  They want you to wear the mask as a sign of enslavement.
[00:15:14.068 --> 00:15:18.689]  It's all a giant Milgram experiment or a Stanford prison experiment.
[00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:23.271]  We'll tell you about that in the second hour because this isn't just going to blow over.
[00:15:23.351 --> 00:15:24.371]  This is their takeover.
[00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:26.892]  They're coming with the forced inoculations very, very soon.
[00:15:27.172 --> 00:15:29.533]  Kamala Harris says, though, she wouldn't trust a vaccine from Trump.
[00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:30.833]  So is Trump with the vaccines?
[00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:32.694]  I'll tell you what's really going on second hour.
[00:15:33.074 --> 00:15:36.895]  But coming up next, we'll tell you about their plan to contest the election and trigger civil war.
[00:15:38.575 --> 00:15:40.396]  Welcome back again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:15:41.496 --> 00:15:45.277]  And if you're tuning in driving down the highway somewhere and you're going, what in the world is this guy covering?
[00:15:46.698 --> 00:15:58.622]  Believe me, I can't believe they're out in the open setting up world government, funding race riots, admitting that millions of people have been given polio and many of them killed with the vaccine.
[00:15:58.642 --> 00:16:01.163]  I mean, I've known that forever, but they've covered it up.
[00:16:01.223 --> 00:16:02.143]  Now they're not even hiding it.
[00:16:05.981 --> 00:16:06.822]  Stuff's getting crazy.
[00:16:06.862 --> 00:16:08.342]  Now, let's talk about Kamala Harris.
[00:16:09.563 --> 00:16:10.604]  Joe Biden can't talk.
[00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:18.509]  His dementia is so clear now, when he sees his wife during a speech, he goes, ah, there's my wife.
[00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:23.672]  Her name, she's my, my wife, my wife, my, my, my wife.
[00:16:24.172 --> 00:16:28.735]  I mean, this is later onset.
[00:16:29.778 --> 00:16:36.139]  I'd say on a scale of 1 to 100, 1's the beginning of realizing you're starting to have Alzheimer's to 100, being your total vegetable.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:48.421]  In a coma, I mean, Biden's about a 65 or 70, and once you go past that, I've had family it happens to, it's very sad.
[00:16:49.001 --> 00:16:50.722]  I mean, in like a month, they're like an 80.
[00:16:52.202 --> 00:16:57.763]  And then they're a 90, and then it kind of goes back to an 80, and then they're in a coma for a week, and then they're kind of back to knowing who you are.
[00:16:59.016 --> 00:17:05.481]  It's it's it comes it's very very sad but I mean this is who they're putting forward because he's a puppet.
[00:17:08.223 --> 00:17:09.343]  This is really frightening.
[00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:14.487]  So Kamala Harris came out and she said oh because we know the Russians are manipulating.
[00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:16.709]  I mean even Nancy Pelosi
[00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:22.953]  said two weeks ago, oh, China is rooting for Biden and China is openly owns most of Hollywood.
[00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:27.375]  It's allowed to run all its propaganda on Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, attack America.
[00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:28.896]  All the patriots are censored.
[00:17:29.116 --> 00:17:33.218]  The president's censored on Twitter and everywhere else.
[00:17:35.098 --> 00:17:38.380]  Facebook said they won't even take political ads starting in a few weeks from the Republicans.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.943]  But they're going to say again after it was all debunked that, oh, we're going to contest it because
[00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:48.252]  The Russians.
[00:17:49.574 --> 00:17:55.003]  She says no matter what, if they lose, they're going to contest.
[00:17:55.043 --> 00:18:00.872]  Now I told you that 14 months ago, because they first used the CIA operatives.
[00:18:03.422 --> 00:18:09.126]  That they got into Congress and others to circulate at the CFR that we need to trigger COG.
[00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:10.648]  We need to contest no matter what.
[00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:14.110]  We need to have the states secede and put Biden in.
[00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:21.716]  And even if Trump won't leave and the Pentagon sides with him, we'll have the blue cities and blue states, and we will have our own inauguration.
[00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:30.243]  And then, five weeks ago, Pelosi comes out and says word for word
[00:18:32.005 --> 00:18:33.146]  The military is going to remove him.
[00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:33.886]  We're going to fumigate him.
[00:18:33.906 --> 00:18:35.647]  But even if he doesn't leave, we'll have our own inauguration.
[00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:38.168]  The presidency is not about a geography.
[00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:39.929]  He may just stay in the White House.
[00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.851]  And now every major Democrat has said it.
[00:18:43.091 --> 00:18:44.432]  The Clintons every day.
[00:18:44.652 --> 00:18:46.073]  We're going to contest no matter what.
[00:18:47.253 --> 00:18:48.475]  Oh, the Red Mirage.
[00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:56.363]  He'll win big, but we'll just keep having these 80 million mail-in ballots that blue states and blue cities printed up that aren't even under federal or state law.
[00:18:56.543 --> 00:19:02.089]  They've just got them, and they're going to just sabotage it and confuse and then have people riot and burn everything.
[00:19:02.109 --> 00:19:02.530]  And you notice...
[00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:17.962]  It's escalated now to highway checkpoints by BLM and Antifa shooting people, and Molotov cocktails, and armed groups going to the Kentucky Derby, and groups of black supremacists with their white cohorts going into Rochester, and overturning tables of people eating dinner and screaming at them.
[00:19:18.762 --> 00:19:24.363]  And it's just upping the ante, upping the ante, upping the ante, and then demonizing any police response back to it.
[00:19:25.743 --> 00:19:29.564]  And you notice, you shoot people, kill people, you don't get in trouble.
[00:19:29.604 --> 00:19:33.025]  But if you defend yourself, you get murder one thrown at you.
[00:19:34.622 --> 00:19:35.462]  So that's the plan.
[00:19:35.482 --> 00:19:45.405]  They've been war-gamed with the article, how the media could get the election wrong again.
[00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:57.808]  And in there they say, oh, Podesta, again, five weeks ago, was war-gaming with Hillary and with Kamala Harris and with Joe Biden.
[00:19:59.858 --> 00:20:03.581]  How they're going to contest it and have the country secede and then hold the stock market hostage.
[00:20:04.061 --> 00:20:13.747]  I mean, that's like Lex Luthor level, Dr. Evil stuff, but it's really going on and the Justice Department may have some good people in it, but it's still run by the deep state.
[00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:20.232]  They're going to sit there with their thumbs in their rears while the super criminals just carry this out of America.
[00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:29.309]  Now there's the headline, a bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election.
[00:20:29.389 --> 00:20:31.110]  It wasn't pretty.
[00:20:35.513 --> 00:20:46.000]  And I've got new articles out today that are on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:20:49.189 --> 00:20:55.333]  Where they're bragging in the news how they're going to plunge the country into total civil war and kill the dollar.
[00:20:56.454 --> 00:20:58.836]  By the way, that headline I just read to you and they're printing it off for me?
[00:20:59.316 --> 00:21:01.557]  That's the Boston Globe.
[00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:10.083]  How they're gonna plunge the country into civil war and secession of the states.
[00:21:10.403 --> 00:21:14.046]  They're now externalizing the entire thing.
[00:21:17.045 --> 00:21:17.865]  So what do you do about it?
[00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:19.706]  I mean, I keep telling you.
[00:21:20.206 --> 00:21:24.167]  Why have they suppressed and censored the President and Infowars and anybody that tells the truth?
[00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.027]  Because if people learn this, they're going to be against it.
[00:21:27.107 --> 00:21:38.210]  They're in Democrat publications in their own operations getting their people ready, while when we cover it, they go, oh, that's just crazy conspiracy theories because they don't want us to develop a plan to say no to this.
[00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:39.350]  It needs to happen.
[00:21:41.186 --> 00:21:45.830]  And that we need to have a debate about, because this is the end of the country as we know it, because these aren't just another party.
[00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:50.234]  This isn't the Democrats that caused the last civil war, you know, 150, 160 years ago.
[00:21:50.794 --> 00:21:56.779]  This is Democrats that work for China and the globalists that say the country shouldn't exist.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:03.165]  I've got them in New York, in Portland, everywhere chanting, death to America and death to white people.
[00:22:08.032 --> 00:22:08.733]  Here's another article.
[00:22:08.793 --> 00:22:13.159]  Bipartisan Washington insiders reveal their plan for chaos if Trump wins the election.
[00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:15.843]  Their plan for chaos!
[00:22:17.965 --> 00:22:21.130]  So let's hear a little bit of Kamala talking about this today.
[00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:21.470]  Here it is.
[00:22:23.226 --> 00:22:30.649]  Yeah, the Department of Homeland Security bulletin said that Russia is trying to amplify... Just hit pause, hit pause.
[00:22:30.729 --> 00:22:31.989]  I'm gonna go to break, come back with this.
[00:22:32.449 --> 00:22:33.590]  Back it up to the first second, though.
[00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.650]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:48.875]  They're like 30 feet apart, this kabuki theater, that, oh, you're a dirty human, I can't get near you, COVID's so bad, when they now admit 94% of people they say died of it didn't, so 9,000-something people died from it, and then it turns out that's almost all a fraud.
[00:22:50.976 --> 00:22:52.517]  Meanwhile, millions have gotten
[00:22:53.732 --> 00:22:55.613]  Tuberculosis had died from it last year.
[00:22:55.633 --> 00:22:56.533]  1.4 million.
[00:22:56.734 --> 00:22:57.654]  That's a real pandemic.
[00:22:57.814 --> 00:22:58.795]  But that's open borders.
[00:22:58.835 --> 00:22:59.395]  They don't care.
[00:22:59.735 --> 00:23:03.877]  When kids come in from Latin America that have it, they don't give them treatment, and they don't give your kids treatment.
[00:23:04.037 --> 00:23:05.238]  They just spread it, spread it, spread it.
[00:23:05.798 --> 00:23:07.899]  Oh, but if you're not wearing a mask, you're not a hero.
[00:23:08.139 --> 00:23:11.241]  It's about living in the sick cult of these monsters.
[00:23:13.282 --> 00:23:16.364]  1.4 million died in 2019 of TB in the U.S.
[00:23:16.384 --> 00:23:16.684]  Look it up.
[00:23:17.869 --> 00:23:18.290]  1.4 mil.
[00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:19.631]  1.4 mil.
[00:23:19.651 --> 00:23:20.872]  1.4 mil.
[00:23:21.132 --> 00:23:28.238]  They say 180,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 and the CDC releases it and goes, okay, we just put it on the death certificate because they got money for that.
[00:23:28.558 --> 00:23:29.379]  It was 9,400 and something.
[00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:29.839]  94% different number.
[00:23:34.738 --> 00:23:40.282]  And I'm reading the AP that's a whitewash about the polio, but admits it's the main spreader of polio is the vaccine.
[00:23:41.343 --> 00:23:42.384]  It's a live vaccine!
[00:23:42.664 --> 00:23:44.425]  Hell, that's just a live virus vaccine!
[00:23:44.445 --> 00:23:44.946]  That's bad enough!
[00:23:45.787 --> 00:23:53.873]  Bill Gates has got three new vaccines that are DNA vaccines, not even tested on animals, that go in and change your cell at the nuclei level.
[00:23:58.236 --> 00:23:58.596]  Wow!
[00:23:59.634 --> 00:24:01.676]  All right, we're going to come back and hit this on the other side.
[00:24:01.716 --> 00:24:02.176]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:02.196 --> 00:24:06.840]  We'll get into all the rioting and the rest of it, but let me tell you, everybody's been sitting on the fence.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.281]  You're not going to be on the fence much longer.
[00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:09.662]  The fence is going down.
[00:24:17.388 --> 00:24:19.489]  Senator Rand Paul's been shot at.
[00:24:23.032 --> 00:24:24.953]  He's had his ribs broken, his lungs punctured.
[00:24:24.993 --> 00:24:28.096]  He's had people scream, we're going to kill you, and attack police officers that can barely protect him.
[00:24:29.246 --> 00:24:30.567]  He's had countless death threats.
[00:24:31.367 --> 00:24:33.148]  He's a soldier in the fight for the Republic.
[00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:42.894]  J. Aaron Danielson, who was murdered last week in Portland, Oregon.
[00:24:43.154 --> 00:24:50.058]  They've now released the footage and photos of the demon, Michael Reinold, chasing him, following him, stalking him.
[00:24:50.438 --> 00:24:52.279]  Said he killed him because he was going to attack a black person.
[00:24:52.299 --> 00:24:53.340]  There were no black people around.
[00:24:54.824 --> 00:24:59.687]  The lion, Michael Reinold, also said he was a veteran, never in the military.
[00:25:01.548 --> 00:25:04.389]  Well, they had a memorial service for Jay.
[00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:14.615]  And edit, when the guy was in the parking lot, militant leftists ran over the Trump supporter who's in a coma with brain bleeds right now.
[00:25:20.725 --> 00:25:21.405]  This is unbelievable.
[00:25:21.425 --> 00:25:24.647]  We've got to get Enrique Tarrio on top of what happened to this man.
[00:25:26.168 --> 00:25:27.408]  Remember the Proud Boys Hospital?
[00:25:27.428 --> 00:25:36.192]  A lot of severe injuries were being hit by a car for attempting a memorial for Aaron J. Danielson, the President Donald Trump supporter, who was murdered by Antifa in Portland.
[00:25:37.013 --> 00:25:38.113]  That goes into what happened to this man.
[00:25:39.514 --> 00:25:40.054]  So there you go.
[00:25:40.094 --> 00:25:41.615]  Who's running people over with cars, folks?
[00:25:41.675 --> 00:25:42.055]  It's them.
[00:25:45.302 --> 00:25:46.963]  And now Kamala Harris has come out.
[00:25:47.863 --> 00:25:49.064]  The New York Times has come out.
[00:25:49.124 --> 00:25:53.145]  The Boston Globe has come out and said, we're going to contest.
[00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:54.146]  We know we're going to lose.
[00:25:56.146 --> 00:25:58.847]  They tried to bring America down, tried to bankrupt it, tried to kill the dollar.
[00:25:58.867 --> 00:25:59.748]  They still may be able to.
[00:26:00.288 --> 00:26:01.248]  They know they're getting the blame.
[00:26:01.288 --> 00:26:02.529]  Americans have a memory suddenly.
[00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:04.150]  It wasn't that we didn't have a memory.
[00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.530]  We were lazy, not paying attention.
[00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.250]  We were asleep.
[00:26:06.511 --> 00:26:07.211]  We were distracted.
[00:26:09.172 --> 00:26:10.052]  Hell, I know I was.
[00:26:10.072 --> 00:26:11.152]  I mean, I've been fighting hard.
[00:26:11.493 --> 00:26:12.453]  I'm a lot more focused now.
[00:26:17.793 --> 00:26:18.874]  I know we're down to the wire.
[00:26:24.698 --> 00:26:27.380]  And I just see all the horrible things these people have done and how evil they are.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.182]  We just can't let them control this country and the world.
[00:26:30.222 --> 00:26:33.125]  We have to push back and we are taking the planet back from the globals.
[00:26:33.145 --> 00:26:34.686]  That's why they're launching all these attacks.
[00:26:36.288 --> 00:26:45.415]  But let's go back to Kamala Harris on TV, social distancing, 20 foot from a woman, all of this, the theater, like you're idiots, like you're monkey see monkey do.
[00:26:46.075 --> 00:26:55.282]  And here's this criminal globalist, this lying fraud that said Joe Biden's a racist, not fit to be president.
[00:26:55.562 --> 00:26:58.264]  Now he's the best guy since sliced bread because he's going to step down.
[00:26:58.324 --> 00:27:02.828]  She's going to move into the position and somebody with her, you probably guess who that is.
[00:27:04.582 --> 00:27:06.722]  Pelosi has said she will have the position.
[00:27:07.803 --> 00:27:14.904]  And in the Constitution, if no one's been chosen as president, because they've contested it on January 20th, the president and vice president leave the White House.
[00:27:15.264 --> 00:27:17.205]  So we're in this constitutional crisis.
[00:27:17.245 --> 00:27:18.205]  They've said they're doing it.
[00:27:19.765 --> 00:27:23.786]  It's like somebody pulling a gun out saying, I'm going to kill you, and they've got the safety off their finger on the trigger.
[00:27:23.826 --> 00:27:24.446]  They're doing it.
[00:27:24.986 --> 00:27:29.207]  Or somebody swinging a baseball bat, or your head's in a guillotine, and they kick the switch, and it starts falling.
[00:27:29.427 --> 00:27:31.028]  The guillotine's falling 57 days out.
[00:27:36.752 --> 00:27:37.654]  What are we going to do?
[00:27:41.262 --> 00:27:43.246]  Constitutionally, legally and lawfully?
[00:27:43.327 --> 00:27:43.467]  Well...
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:28:04.438]  They're going to have riots nationwide and say it's race attacks and try to go in and attack white people everywhere to get white people to fight back, to have the image of whites and blacks fighting, because they believe they can then, and I'm not the racist here, it's George Soros that says this, and Alexander Soros and the documents we got in the WikiLeaks, that they will then trigger blacks to riot nationwide and burn down the country.
[00:28:04.818 --> 00:28:07.220]  And that then they can kill the dollar because the U.S.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.702]  collapses and they sink the whole ship.
[00:28:10.424 --> 00:28:13.706]  A Nazi collaborator talking about how they're going to make black people destroy the country.
[00:28:14.506 --> 00:28:16.087]  That's why some whites get threatened by this.
[00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:24.271]  They see racist blacks attacking them and you start buying into the fact that that is a small minority of minority that is dumbed down and criminal and stupid and certainly defend yourself.
[00:28:24.651 --> 00:28:26.953]  And I'm not defending black people attacking white people.
[00:28:26.993 --> 00:28:31.055]  I'm saying what matters is the end game to bring the whole country down.
[00:28:33.356 --> 00:28:36.517]  And so you got a bunch of white people getting ready to go crazy too, not just black people.
[00:28:37.038 --> 00:28:37.958]  This is not going to be good.
[00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:39.459]  I can assure you.
[00:28:42.776 --> 00:28:44.937]  There's gonna be a lot of dead people.
[00:28:46.127 --> 00:28:49.990]  And once white people go crazy, a lot of dead black people, which is not good.
[00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:53.832]  Because the real black people getting killed are in the abortion mills, like Kanye said.
[00:28:54.052 --> 00:28:55.733]  So let's not take the bait.
[00:28:56.214 --> 00:29:14.066]  But they're pushing hard, so you gotta expose the bait, you gotta expose the operation, while they march in hundreds of these black supremacists on a white person with them, saying whites are evil, marching into Kentucky Derby, hoping to have a fight in Kentucky, hoping to get in a riot and clashing with other people at the Kentucky Derby.
[00:29:14.126 --> 00:29:15.887]  This is a time bomb.
[00:29:17.448 --> 00:29:18.890]  This is organized crime.
[00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:26.436]  This is Antifa and Soros and others literally funding an attempt for the country to go down in flames.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:35.044]  And they got such peckerwoods in this group, every time they march, they shoot one of their own people.
[00:29:35.724 --> 00:29:36.745]  It's happened like four times.
[00:29:38.267 --> 00:29:40.629]  I mean, this is a peckerwood convention.
[00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:42.831]  And then you get a bunch of drunk
[00:29:44.295 --> 00:29:46.577]  Killbillies and rich people, black, white, you name it.
[00:29:46.958 --> 00:29:48.440]  This is not a good situation.
[00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:54.246]  Meanwhile, they call Proud Boys a white supremacist group, but it's a very diverse group of great people.
[00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:58.370]  That's a supremacist group we just showed you on screen for TV viewers.
[00:29:58.731 --> 00:30:05.198]  Let's go to Kamala Harris, saying, oh, Russiagate is why they're going to contest when they lose.
[00:30:06.664 --> 00:30:10.905]  Because the Russians are so powerful and so magic, they've made us not accept the joke.
[00:30:11.045 --> 00:30:14.265]  They've been in the news saying that it's Russia with no proof.
[00:30:14.685 --> 00:30:17.126]  Russia makes people think Biden can't talk.
[00:30:17.626 --> 00:30:19.106]  Gee, I thought it was because he can't talk.
[00:30:21.407 --> 00:30:23.367]  Again, if you fall on a banana peel, it's the Russians.
[00:30:24.207 --> 00:30:33.129]  If you didn't remember to put your deodorant on or floss your teeth, or maybe your homework got lost, it's the Russians.
[00:30:33.936 --> 00:30:42.480]  But here she is, folks, because they're the globalists, they're the outsiders, telling you, we're going to say Trump's with the outsiders when they're the people ending the country.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:48.283]  And we'll come back after her with the chant, Death to America by Antifa in New York.
[00:30:48.543 --> 00:30:49.484]  It's all over the country.
[00:30:49.664 --> 00:30:50.805]  They have banners printed out.
[00:30:51.025 --> 00:30:51.605]  It's who they are.
[00:30:51.665 --> 00:30:51.985]  Here it is.
[00:30:53.996 --> 00:30:55.017]  No, they didn't.
[00:31:24.196 --> 00:31:25.397]  Well, it was.
[00:31:27.859 --> 00:31:29.941]  They say Roger Stone was a Russian asset.
[00:31:30.401 --> 00:31:31.942]  He was never even investigated for that.
[00:31:31.982 --> 00:31:33.503]  It was for talking to WikiLeaks, which wasn't even true.
[00:31:33.704 --> 00:31:35.185]  That's just another lie out of her mouth.
[00:31:35.205 --> 00:31:35.625]  Continue.
[00:31:37.507 --> 00:31:42.230]  ...will be foreign interference in the 2020 election and that Russia will be at the front of the line.
[00:31:42.911 --> 00:31:44.112]  Could it cost you the White House?
[00:31:44.732 --> 00:31:45.673]  Theoretically, of course.
[00:31:47.113 --> 00:31:47.413]  Yes.
[00:31:47.874 --> 00:31:50.996]  And that's based on what you're hearing publicly?
[00:31:51.077 --> 00:31:52.658]  Or you mentioned you're on the same intelligence committee.
[00:31:52.678 --> 00:31:53.719]  Listen, let me just tell you something.
[00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:55.400]  We have to be a realist.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.481]  And I'm a realist about it.
[00:31:56.521 --> 00:31:57.582]  Joe's a realist about it.
[00:31:58.323 --> 00:32:01.506]  We have classic voter suppression at play in this election coming up.
[00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:20.347]  Where after the Supreme Court gutted the voting rights act in 2013, dozens of states passed laws that were designed to suppress the black vote, to suppress students from voting, to suppress our indigenous people from voting, so much so that in North Carolina...
[00:32:21.227 --> 00:32:26.253]  Democrats passed laws in their states where you can get a driver's license with no ID or proof and then vote.
[00:32:26.633 --> 00:32:30.577]  Republican states just passed laws saying you gotta have a driver's license and be a citizen to vote.
[00:32:30.918 --> 00:32:32.219]  That's called the law, you witch!
[00:32:32.279 --> 00:32:32.840]  Let's continue.
[00:32:34.136 --> 00:32:40.298]  The law was passed with surgical precision to get in the way of black voters from voting.
[00:32:40.378 --> 00:32:40.859]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:32:40.899 --> 00:32:42.879]  So we have classic voter suppression.
[00:32:43.219 --> 00:32:46.741]  We have what happened in 2016, which is foreign interference.
[00:32:47.201 --> 00:32:57.205]  We have a president who is trying to convince the American people not to believe in the integrity of our election system and compromise their belief that their vote might actually count.
[00:32:58.205 --> 00:32:59.966]  These things are all at play.
[00:33:00.766 --> 00:33:15.073]  And I am very realistic, Joe is very realistic about the fact that until we can win and get in and put some teeth back in the Voting Rights Act and bring back the public's confidence in the system, that there will be many obstacles.
[00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:20.610]  Um, that people are intentionally placing in front of Americans' ability to vote.
[00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.091]  But we will surpass and surmount and get around those obstacles.
[00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:28.753]  It's Republicans that overrode the Democrats and had voting rights for blacks, you lying witch.
[00:33:29.293 --> 00:33:31.314]  And that got black people guns, you lying monster.
[00:33:31.714 --> 00:33:35.215]  And they're the ones saying the election isn't legitimate, run by Russians already!
[00:33:35.455 --> 00:33:38.917]  And that if Trump contests their contention, the military should take him out.
[00:33:38.957 --> 00:33:39.937]  Bill Clinton said that last week.
[00:33:40.177 --> 00:33:40.577]  Well, guess what?
[00:33:40.597 --> 00:33:42.558]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs said that's illegal.
[00:33:42.878 --> 00:33:44.739]  You asked for a coup, you monster!
[00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:46.340]  Pedophile Bill Clinton?
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.721]  Burn in hell, Clinton!
[00:33:47.741 --> 00:33:51.604]  Burn in hell!
[00:33:52.284 --> 00:33:56.327]  Oh, the New World Order is so scared that Trump should get that second term.
[00:33:56.347 --> 00:33:59.590]  That he really will get that swamp drain.
[00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:00.270]  He's the real deal.
[00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:08.016]  Let's talk about why they're so scared of Trump that they get into all this escalation of rioting, looting, and killing towards the election, which is their plan.
[00:34:08.036 --> 00:34:13.561]  The smoke screen for trying to remove President Trump under continuity of government emergency, separate from the 25th Amendment.
[00:34:16.636 --> 00:34:19.477]  We already covered Dems vowed to not accept election results.
[00:34:20.398 --> 00:34:25.960]  If they lose, the bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump election.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:26.800]  It wasn't pretty.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.041]  It's a bunch of never-Trumpers, neocons, deep staters.
[00:34:31.342 --> 00:34:33.303]  A new article on InfoWars.com today.
[00:34:33.823 --> 00:34:38.185]  Bipartisan Washington insiders reveal their plan for chaos if Trump wins the election.
[00:34:38.465 --> 00:34:39.025]  Secession.
[00:34:39.105 --> 00:34:39.725]  Civil War.
[00:34:40.806 --> 00:34:42.126]  Hold the stock market hostage.
[00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:44.167]  This is incredibly criminal stuff.
[00:34:45.047 --> 00:34:46.068]  But they're the establishment.
[00:34:47.381 --> 00:34:50.984]  They've now had John Malkovich's son arrested in Portland riot.
[00:34:51.525 --> 00:34:56.589]  They've got all these other millionaire and billionaire kids caught attacking in New York and arrested.
[00:34:56.629 --> 00:35:01.213]  This is the armies of the ultra-rich out trying to get black people to riot.
[00:35:04.576 --> 00:35:06.138]  Systematic collapse of society.
[00:35:06.198 --> 00:35:08.240]  Manufactured election crisis and famine.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.322]  Another big article on Infowars.com.
[00:35:11.465 --> 00:35:12.446]  Why are they so angry?
[00:35:12.466 --> 00:35:13.046]  Because of this.
[00:35:13.766 --> 00:35:16.928]  Trump pulling us out of Afghanistan, pulling us out of Syria, 95%.
[00:35:16.968 --> 00:35:23.412]  After 21 years, breakthrough reach between Serbia and Kosovo.
[00:35:23.472 --> 00:35:25.353]  An actual peace deal.
[00:35:25.413 --> 00:35:26.094]  A huge deal.
[00:35:26.834 --> 00:35:28.935]  For three years, he's gotten North Korea back down.
[00:35:29.576 --> 00:35:30.936]  It ain't perfect, but de-escalated 90%.
[00:35:33.217 --> 00:35:38.180]  They're pissed because Trump's a realist and just wants prosperity for everybody and wants to make deals with people.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.501]  He wants to build hotels in North Korea and free that population.
[00:35:43.282 --> 00:35:44.223]  But evil doesn't want that.
[00:35:44.723 --> 00:35:50.546]  Trump wants black people to be successful and wealthy and white people and old people and young people and he's not against Jews.
[00:35:50.586 --> 00:35:51.526]  He's not against Muslims.
[00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:55.088]  He's not against anybody who's not against freedom and America and prosperity.
[00:35:55.348 --> 00:35:56.109]  Trump's the real deal.
[00:35:57.014 --> 00:35:58.076]  He's an industrialist.
[00:35:58.356 --> 00:35:59.498]  He's a businessman.
[00:35:59.518 --> 00:36:00.720]  He's a service economy guy.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.882]  He believes in people.
[00:36:02.263 --> 00:36:03.384]  He likes to have children.
[00:36:03.404 --> 00:36:04.186]  He likes women.
[00:36:04.646 --> 00:36:06.129]  He's not a devil worshipper.
[00:36:06.149 --> 00:36:08.953]  So that's why they're angry.
[00:36:08.973 --> 00:36:11.037]  The big peace deal that the media's not even covering.
[00:36:12.748 --> 00:36:14.529]  Let me tell you about the folks attacking the president.
[00:36:15.049 --> 00:36:36.395]  This Jeffrey Goldberg worked for Israeli intelligence and a bunch of their operations and he works for the deep state and he wanted to meet with me, I guess this was about six years ago, and he came here and I read his article that he didn't write then, he just wrote this a few months ago and what he said in there about me, part of it was true, part of it was totally not true.
[00:36:37.256 --> 00:36:41.557]  So the guy saying that Trump runs around and says he hates the troops and they're losers,
[00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.811]  Everybody knows Trump fetishizes the trims.
[00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:48.492]  If anything, he gives too much respect to the brass when he should not trust some of them.
[00:36:49.513 --> 00:36:56.096]  But this idea came right out of the guy who wrote, The Conspiracy Theorists Are Winning.
[00:36:58.117 --> 00:37:01.898]  And notice he says in the article that I claim vaccines are giving people polio.
[00:37:02.499 --> 00:37:03.639]  Well, that didn't age well.
[00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:05.140]  Or vaccines are sterilizing people.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.300]  That didn't age well.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.782]  In fact, you know, the article is needles raining down.
[00:37:12.346 --> 00:37:14.368]  Because I'm crazy, you know, vaccines never did anything.
[00:37:14.788 --> 00:37:18.832]  Friday, AP, number one cause of polio worldwide, vaccines.
[00:37:21.654 --> 00:37:33.804]  And so he comes here and just acts all smug and brags to me for an hour about how the guy that hired him that owns the Atlantic is a big Democrat.
[00:37:34.895 --> 00:37:37.057]  Brought ponies over to show his daughter.
[00:37:37.477 --> 00:37:38.458]  That's in the article!
[00:37:38.938 --> 00:37:41.981]  Him bragging about the guy brought ponies to his house.
[00:37:42.361 --> 00:37:42.562]  What?
[00:37:43.542 --> 00:37:50.548]  I've done that at a bunch of my girls' parties where you call and for $300 they bring a couple ponies and kids ride ponies in your yard.
[00:37:51.609 --> 00:37:53.130]  What kind of weird brain is this?
[00:37:53.531 --> 00:37:59.376]  He's the famous guy that made up the WMD stuff and is credited as the number one fraudster.
[00:38:00.768 --> 00:38:17.798]  So this known fraud that lies about me and Twist comes out and says Trump hates the veterans and wouldn't fly on a helicopter to a deal when they've confirmed the Marines said they couldn't fly helicopters because of high winds?
[00:38:18.518 --> 00:38:19.639]  There was one case in Virginia.
[00:38:19.679 --> 00:38:20.399]  This was in France.
[00:38:20.419 --> 00:38:21.340]  I got the two confused.
[00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:25.582]  So that's Jeffrey Goldberg.
[00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:33.272]  But he works, I guess, for like Omert and the leftists in Israel, not the Netanyahu crowd.
[00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:41.796]  And the Democrats were caught saying that a veteran that has his face burned off is with them, and he wasn't.
[00:38:42.096 --> 00:38:42.976]  That was all a big lie.
[00:38:43.016 --> 00:38:44.337]  You're a scum, Iraq War veteran.
[00:38:44.357 --> 00:38:47.198]  Blast Democrats for using his image and disparaging Trump.
[00:38:49.537 --> 00:38:56.281]  And all the military's coming out saying he visited them in the hospital and did a great job and really had tears in his eyes and they've never been treated so well.
[00:38:56.722 --> 00:39:00.484]  You know, he's got the VA partially fixed when the Democrats didn't give a damn about you.
[00:39:00.744 --> 00:39:02.505]  I mean, don't believe reality, just believe their lies.
[00:39:02.846 --> 00:39:08.329]  Oh, and now Cohen, the stoolie, the jailbird, he says Trump's racist.
[00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.651]  Of course, of course he is.
[00:39:13.993 --> 00:39:18.656]  So, that's all they got, folks, is another big giant bucket
[00:39:19.747 --> 00:39:20.948]  A fake news and lies.
[00:39:20.968 --> 00:39:27.776]  And they plan a big race war thing on top of it.
[00:39:27.816 --> 00:39:38.066]  And so now they're escalating Black Lives Matter going in and attacking white people eating dinner and running over people at funeral services and antifa shooting people in the head, in the chest.
[00:39:38.347 --> 00:39:40.309]  But it's not working.
[00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.110]  But you know what?
[00:39:43.231 --> 00:39:44.331]  Let's play this clip right now.
[00:39:44.351 --> 00:39:45.052]  This is important.
[00:39:45.132 --> 00:39:45.532]  Back it up.
[00:39:46.052 --> 00:39:47.773]  This is in Rochester two nights ago.
[00:39:48.113 --> 00:39:49.634]  I got a stack of video even worse.
[00:39:50.174 --> 00:39:52.976]  They're now throwing mall-off cocktails and running people over and shooting them.
[00:39:52.996 --> 00:39:56.878]  But imagine, there's families out at night eating dinner, and here comes Black Lives Matter.
[00:39:57.198 --> 00:39:58.619]  Actually, half of them are black.
[00:39:58.859 --> 00:39:59.740]  That's not usually the case.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:05.323]  And they start climbing on top of people's houses and then saying, when we commit crimes, don't videotape it.
[00:40:05.343 --> 00:40:09.185]  And then they're smashing tables saying, don't run, nobody was mean to you.
[00:40:10.828 --> 00:40:12.108]  Don't run, we are your friends.
[00:40:13.449 --> 00:40:14.890]  So they even add the doublespeak.
[00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.110]  While, where's Nadler?
[00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.312]  Like, oh, Antifa and Black Lives Matter, they don't exist.
[00:40:21.132 --> 00:40:27.114]  Here, go ahead and go to the clip.
[00:40:27.154 --> 00:40:29.295]  Radio listeners, this is an outdoor restaurant.
[00:40:29.315 --> 00:40:36.278]  They attack, overturn stuff, then go inside for smashing glasses in people's faces and throwing chairs through windows.
[00:40:41.941 --> 00:40:45.842]  Somebody gets shot in Texas doing this.
[00:40:46.142 --> 00:40:50.003]  I hope that didn't happen.
[00:40:52.904 --> 00:40:56.445]  Literally paid black people by Soros to start a race riot.
[00:41:01.046 --> 00:41:08.588]  In Dallas they attacked a black owned restaurant and the black guys are throwing them out.
[00:41:12.205 --> 00:41:14.105]  And then they attack and go inside the restaurant.
[00:41:15.066 --> 00:41:16.446]  They start knocking the windows out.
[00:41:16.626 --> 00:41:19.487]  I mean, this is insane, man.
[00:41:19.547 --> 00:41:21.327]  A giant mob of crazy people.
[00:41:23.308 --> 00:41:25.688]  And the white dudes tell them, folks, don't break in.
[00:41:25.708 --> 00:41:26.728]  The black lady goes, no, we are.
[00:41:26.748 --> 00:41:31.770]  So then they storm into the restaurant with a flag after taking Iwo Jima.
[00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.530]  If you don't give us our shit!
[00:41:35.791 --> 00:41:38.951]  If you don't give us our shit!
[00:41:39.031 --> 00:41:39.671]  No, we gotta watch.
[00:41:39.691 --> 00:41:40.652]  Go ahead and turn this off.
[00:41:40.712 --> 00:41:41.632]  I thought this was bleeped.
[00:41:42.773 --> 00:41:44.955]  And then they smash tables, throw stuff through the windows.
[00:41:47.216 --> 00:41:49.618]  Oh my gosh, this just gets worse and worse, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:50.439 --> 00:41:55.923]  I mean, imagine families surrounded, they start smashing the table, throwing chairs through the windows.
[00:41:59.405 --> 00:42:03.608]  And again, you're at the Kentucky Derby and here come like 400 armed black people telling you your baggage are white.
[00:42:04.009 --> 00:42:06.711]  This is how the Democrats respond, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:09.073 --> 00:42:11.054]  But let's go ahead and roll the TMZ video.
[00:42:11.114 --> 00:42:12.055]  That's bleeped.
[00:42:12.315 --> 00:42:13.516]  Yeah, there's George Soros.
[00:42:13.736 --> 00:42:14.076]  $220 million.
[00:42:14.297 --> 00:42:15.878]  The Black Lives Matter to do what you just saw.
[00:42:16.138 --> 00:42:17.299]  He's overthrown Ukraine.
[00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:18.580]  He's overthrown Egypt.
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:19.980]  He's overthrown Syria.
[00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:21.321]  He's overthrown Libya.
[00:42:22.642 --> 00:42:24.804]  Oh, yeah, all these places where black folks are getting killed.
[00:42:25.684 --> 00:42:26.865]  So he thinks he's gonna win again.
[00:42:26.905 --> 00:42:27.786]  That's why he's so arrogant.
[00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:40.034]  But here's the footage of Portland last night, where they try to throw them all off cocktail police, and the idiot drops it and catches himself on fire and thinks running while you're on fire is the thing to do.
[00:42:40.094 --> 00:42:40.434]  Here it is.
[00:42:56.257 --> 00:42:59.399]  Again, here's the guy getting himself caught on fire, and he thinks
[00:43:27.188 --> 00:43:28.729]  No one tells him to get the shoes off, man.
[00:43:30.831 --> 00:43:32.712]  They're trying to put gasoline out with their hands.
[00:43:34.314 --> 00:43:35.375]  These are real morons.
[00:43:36.135 --> 00:43:38.557]  And they're trying to hit his foot with a shield.
[00:43:38.577 --> 00:43:39.118]  That'll help.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.401]  It's called gasoline.
[00:43:43.561 --> 00:43:45.002]  A highly explosive propellant.
[00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:48.605]  Now the police come and put him out, and then they attack the police.
[00:43:49.906 --> 00:43:50.847]  Cops shouldn't have put him out.
[00:43:53.712 --> 00:43:54.612]  Alright, alright, alright.
[00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:55.493]  Listen, we're out of time.
[00:43:55.513 --> 00:43:56.013]  We're out of time.
[00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:57.294]  We gotta start hour number two.
[00:43:57.534 --> 00:43:59.015]  Some stations don't care the first five minutes.
[00:43:59.035 --> 00:44:04.938]  We're gonna air a very powerful video that's a Band-Odd video in the Gregory section titled, Written House, The Line in the Sand.
[00:44:04.958 --> 00:44:10.821]  That's coming up and an investigative journalist getting into something so out of control that it's hard to believe.
[00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:12.621]  Even I can't believe it, but it's all documented.
[00:44:12.641 --> 00:44:13.762]  Hour number two coming up.
[00:44:15.803 --> 00:44:21.326]  Four deaths in late August 2020 have anchored a line in the sand in America.
[00:44:22.443 --> 00:44:30.186]  On the morning of August 25th, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was working as a lifeguard in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[00:44:30.786 --> 00:44:42.230]  After his shift, he volunteered to clean graffiti, where he got in touch with some concerned local business owners, and volunteered to protect their property and provide medical aid.
[00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:47.872]  So people are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business, and part of my job is also helping people.
[00:44:48.132 --> 00:44:50.452]  If there's somebody hurt, I'm running into harm's way.
[00:44:50.873 --> 00:44:51.833]  That's why I have my rifle.
[00:44:55.483 --> 00:44:59.526]  His weapon never crossed state lines and was legal to carry.
[00:45:00.467 --> 00:45:03.129]  Rittenhouse was assaulted and threatened by the mob.
[00:45:03.149 --> 00:45:07.793]  We're protecting from the citizens and I just got pepper sprayed by a person in the crowd.
[00:45:08.254 --> 00:45:11.296]  And continued offering first aid to all who needed it.
[00:45:11.316 --> 00:45:14.499]  So you had non-lethal but you didn't respond?
[00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:15.820]  We don't have non-lethal.
[00:45:16.776 --> 00:45:19.039]  So you guys are full on ready to defend the property?
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.141]  Yes we are.
[00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:22.284]  Now if I can ask, can you guys step back?
[00:45:22.624 --> 00:45:23.025]  Medical!
[00:45:23.285 --> 00:45:26.569]  EMS right here!
[00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:31.176]  The mob became angry that citizens were out protecting businesses.
[00:45:36.004 --> 00:45:38.846]  And we see Rosenbaum getting combative.
[00:45:42.569 --> 00:45:45.632]  Later, we see Rittenhouse attempting to put out a fire.
[00:45:46.453 --> 00:45:48.514]  And the mob responded by chasing him.
[00:45:49.695 --> 00:45:53.178]  As Rittenhouse is fleeing the mob, we hear gunshots.
[00:45:54.099 --> 00:45:57.222]  It appears someone behind him has fired a gun in the air.
[00:45:57.862 --> 00:46:01.926]  As the mob descended upon him, he turned and fired upon Rosenbaum.
[00:46:03.854 --> 00:46:10.838]  He stopped to quickly inspect the body, make a phone call to notify a friend, and then headed towards the police.
[00:46:12.459 --> 00:46:14.340]  He was again chased by the mob.
[00:46:15.901 --> 00:46:17.402]  Rittenhouse stumbles and falls.
[00:46:18.102 --> 00:46:20.684]  He is assaulted by Huber and fires upon him.
[00:46:22.945 --> 00:46:28.368]  Before Rittenhouse can get to his feet, Groskritts closes in on him, brandishing a handgun.
[00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:31.730]  Rittenhouse fires upon Groskritts.
[00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:39.114]  The mob then gave way for Rittenhouse to safely make his way to the police, where he surrendered himself.
[00:46:40.635 --> 00:46:51.065]  Rosenbaum and Huber died from their wounds, and Groskritts lived to tell a friend his only regret was not emptying an entire magazine into Rittenhouse.
[00:46:52.486 --> 00:46:57.110]  Rittenhouse was arrested, charged with murder, and slandered in the media.
[00:46:58.174 --> 00:47:01.355]  Now compare this to the recent shooting in Portland.
[00:47:02.195 --> 00:47:07.237]  Video shows a group of people on the evening of August 29th yelling, we got one.
[00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:22.502]  We then see Michael Reinohl approach Aaron Danielson and shoot him execution style, murdering him in the middle of the street.
[00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.873]  Five days later, Reinold was found by U.S.
[00:47:27.933 --> 00:47:28.394]  Marshals.
[00:47:29.175 --> 00:47:33.519]  He resisted arrest, brandished a firearm, and was shot and killed.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:43.950]  But not before he was given a voice to defend himself by the mainstream media, where he claimed he was defending a person of color from being killed.
[00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.893]  I could have sat there and watched him kill a friend of mine of color.
[00:47:48.376 --> 00:47:49.437]  But I wasn't gonna do that.
[00:47:49.477 --> 00:47:54.881]  Reinold said he was 100% Antifa and had a BLM tattoo on his neck.
[00:47:55.741 --> 00:48:00.405]  BLM protesters proudly celebrated the murder of Danielson.
[00:48:01.165 --> 00:48:03.167]  They said they took out the trash.
[00:48:03.367 --> 00:48:03.667]  Hey!
[00:48:03.887 --> 00:48:04.948]  I just got word!
[00:48:05.228 --> 00:48:08.070]  The person who died was a Patriot Panther person!
[00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:10.252]  He was a fucking Nazi!
[00:48:10.552 --> 00:48:12.354]  Our community held it to our own!
[00:48:12.954 --> 00:48:14.095]  I took out the trash!
[00:48:14.488 --> 00:48:20.872]  The mainstream media spins criminals into heroes, and heroes into criminals.
[00:48:21.432 --> 00:48:31.798]  Kyle Rittenhouse killed two criminals defending his life and serving his community, including a pedophile convicted of raping his girlfriend's children.
[00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:35.300]  Rittenhouse did everything right.
[00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:43.638]  And if he is ever convicted, then our God-given right to defend ourselves becomes a criminal offense.
[00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:46.741]  And America will have officially fallen.
[00:48:47.842 --> 00:48:50.224]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:49:06.474 --> 00:49:09.238]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:12.402 --> 00:49:16.627]  Well, there's an old Chinese parable, may you live in interesting times, and it has a double-headed meaning.
[00:49:17.408 --> 00:49:19.271]  That could mean really good things or really bad things.
[00:49:19.331 --> 00:49:23.156]  Well, I think it's up to us and what we do now to determine that future destiny.
[00:49:23.196 --> 00:49:24.458]  But now is the time when
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.061]  Society's been kind of frozen.
[00:49:27.121 --> 00:49:33.427]  It's being put into a liquid form by the globalists and their own missions to try to transform the planet into the tyranny they want.
[00:49:33.847 --> 00:49:39.492]  We can use this transformative period to actually not just hold on to what we have, but lead us forward into the new renaissance.
[00:49:39.953 --> 00:49:40.993]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:49:41.034 --> 00:49:41.774]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:49:42.475 --> 00:49:45.457]  Owen Troyer will be hosting two hours of the new Sunday Live.
[00:49:46.243 --> 00:49:50.087]  Coming up in about 55 minutes when this live transmission is over.
[00:49:50.107 --> 00:49:54.211]  It'll also be popping in the last five minutes or so of this transmission to tell you what is coming up.
[00:49:54.531 --> 00:49:55.512]  I know a lot is going on.
[00:49:55.532 --> 00:49:56.213]  He has a lot to cover.
[00:49:56.233 --> 00:49:58.095]  All right.
[00:49:58.175 --> 00:50:00.297]  For regular listeners and viewers of this show,
[00:50:01.715 --> 00:50:05.376]  This is going to be deja vu and you're going to say, tell me something I don't already know.
[00:50:05.516 --> 00:50:29.646]  But if you actually do daily research, not just on what's coming out in the white papers and the drug reports and the vaccine announcements and the lawsuits, if you're actually studying the larger picture, you have to ask yourself, why are they admitting now that the number one cause of polio on the planet is the polio vaccine and that it's contaminant?
[00:50:30.879 --> 00:50:32.722]  With SV4 to eat cancer viruses.
[00:50:33.444 --> 00:50:38.012]  Why are they admitting that it's killing and maiming little African children?
[00:50:39.856 --> 00:50:42.641]  This is well known, and why are they admitting Bill Gates is running it?
[00:50:44.707 --> 00:50:46.447]  Is this a civil war inside the deep state?
[00:50:46.527 --> 00:50:47.048]  I think so.
[00:50:47.588 --> 00:50:56.750]  Why is Trump saying, oh, warp speed, I have the vaccine, to take control away from Gates and others, to make the stock market go up, to make people not be scared anymore, so if idiots actually want it, they can go get it.
[00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.671]  Trump wants to take power away from them by taking control of the issue.
[00:51:00.711 --> 00:51:04.992]  He's already exposed that vaccines are tainted, they've got bad side effects, but it's a real science.
[00:51:05.472 --> 00:51:07.272]  The problem is, what is Gates jacking into it?
[00:51:07.532 --> 00:51:09.853]  Why are his vaccines so much dangerous than everybody else's?
[00:51:10.753 --> 00:51:13.434]  And this is even on CBS News and ABC News, so why?
[00:51:15.145 --> 00:51:15.826]  Look at this article.
[00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:16.266]  Reuters.
[00:51:16.446 --> 00:51:20.869]  Coronavirus traces found in March of 2019 in sewage sample.
[00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.870]  Why does that matter?
[00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.692]  It supposedly didn't get out until January.
[00:51:26.394 --> 00:51:29.676]  And now the big story is why our guest Patrick Howley is joining us.
[00:51:30.537 --> 00:51:31.518]  Nationalfile.com.
[00:51:31.538 --> 00:51:32.999]  The article is also on Infowars.com.
[00:51:33.299 --> 00:51:36.762]  World Bank records COVID-19 test kits exported
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:38.200]  In 2018.
[00:51:38.701 --> 00:51:40.542]  And then we went and looked.
[00:51:41.003 --> 00:51:44.667]  We found documents where they called it COVID-19 even before that.
[00:51:45.407 --> 00:51:52.835]  And it was a big scandal that Fauci and Obama, when it was illegal, made illegal in the U.S., they moved it to Wuhan.
[00:51:52.875 --> 00:51:53.996]  Here is Newsweek.
[00:51:54.436 --> 00:51:57.459]  Dr. Fauci back controversial Wuhan lab with U.S.
[00:51:57.499 --> 00:51:58.760]  dollars for risky coronavirus.
[00:51:59.181 --> 00:52:00.943]  That's why they're covering up the Chinese origin.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:02.921]  But what is it really?
[00:52:03.001 --> 00:52:04.584]  It's something Gates can own.
[00:52:04.984 --> 00:52:10.912]  It's a mixture of different virus species, so he can then make everybody guilty that has it, because it spreads really easy.
[00:52:11.132 --> 00:52:11.974]  That's really its danger.
[00:52:12.394 --> 00:52:18.202]  If you're super rundown with no vitamins or minerals and above 85 and have cancer and heart attacks, the guy can kill you.
[00:52:20.711 --> 00:52:24.233]  The reason it's so important is they own it and they're going to own the response to it.
[00:52:24.933 --> 00:52:28.656]  And so they don't want Trump bringing in other companies, other groups that actually have a good vaccine for it.
[00:52:28.856 --> 00:52:30.176]  They want him cut out of the equation.
[00:52:30.417 --> 00:52:31.157]  They don't want hope.
[00:52:31.777 --> 00:52:32.778]  Here it is, new scientist.
[00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:33.458]  The scientist.
[00:52:33.739 --> 00:52:35.359]  Lab-made coronavirus triggers debate.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.781]  Obama authorizes Fauci.
[00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:38.681]  Gain of function.
[00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:39.242]  SARS.
[00:52:39.702 --> 00:52:40.202]  COVID.
[00:52:41.763 --> 00:52:42.404]  Chimera.
[00:52:44.905 --> 00:52:49.588]  Absolutely incredible to have all these huge admissions coming out on top
[00:52:50.353 --> 00:52:50.973]  Patrick Howley.
[00:53:07.239 --> 00:53:09.822]  Almost all the tests, 90 plus percent, were false positive.
[00:53:10.362 --> 00:53:12.044]  There's an internal war going on here.
[00:53:12.064 --> 00:53:15.508]  I mean, it's not just, why is the UN admitting that vaccines are killing people?
[00:53:16.089 --> 00:53:17.030]  Have they gotten a conscience?
[00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:20.614]  We know last December, the head of the vaccine program said we shouldn't be giving these.
[00:53:20.634 --> 00:53:21.314]  They're hurting people.
[00:53:21.495 --> 00:53:22.175]  There's no testing.
[00:53:22.396 --> 00:53:23.096]  I played those clips.
[00:53:23.877 --> 00:53:27.759]  Or are they just gonna push this on us like lemons and tell us it'll hurt us up front?
[00:53:28.319 --> 00:53:39.404]  What do you really think's going on, Patrick Howley, investigative journalist who reads for the Epoch Times, Breitbart, Daily Caller, and of course, mainly now as the main writer over there at nationalfile.com.
[00:53:40.125 --> 00:53:44.347]  At Howley Reporter, this is a complex issue, but it's big.
[00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:44.847]  It's big.
[00:53:46.536 --> 00:54:01.363]  Well, Alex, this is a tremendous time to be alive because for the first time, and I was just watching some idiotic CDC official on Fox News, I don't know why, but it's incredible because now they are starting to admit that there are serious problems with the vaccine.
[00:54:01.403 --> 00:54:04.984]  And the reason is, and I study the media very closely, here's the reason.
[00:54:05.424 --> 00:54:13.588]  CNN was predictive programming that there wasn't going to be a vaccine available until after the election, which gives them the pretext in their mind to push for a vote by mail.
[00:54:14.358 --> 00:54:16.600]  Trump then one-ups them.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.841]  He says, all right, we're going to do Operation Warp Speed.
[00:54:18.861 --> 00:54:20.242]  We're going to get a vaccine.
[00:54:20.282 --> 00:54:21.243]  We're going to control it.
[00:54:21.643 --> 00:54:25.366]  Now you have Kamala Harris saying, I don't trust Trump with a vaccine.
[00:54:25.626 --> 00:54:29.909]  Now you have all of the officials in the mainstream media saying, oh, I don't know about this vaccine.
[00:54:30.189 --> 00:54:34.472]  So for the first time ever, due to the fact that vote by mail is more important to them,
[00:54:35.232 --> 00:54:43.658]  They are starting to finally recognize in the mainstream, from their own mouths, what people, including my friend Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:54:43.678 --> 00:54:56.707]  and others, have been saying for decades, which is that there are massive, massive complications with vaccines, including in Africa, where it's eugenics, and they're killing, according to people I've spoken to in Africa, killing little black kids.
[00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:58.828]  And what you said is spot on.
[00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:04.111]  And again, Trump brought me in over two years ago, and his people did, and they said,
[00:55:04.972 --> 00:55:07.013]  He's going to use reverse psychology.
[00:55:07.033 --> 00:55:09.454]  And we're just letting you know this.
[00:55:09.534 --> 00:55:10.995]  And they didn't even say, I can't tell people.
[00:55:11.075 --> 00:55:14.256]  He said he's going to come out and tell Pelosi, fine, we'll give you whatever you want.
[00:55:14.296 --> 00:55:15.076]  Tell us what you want.
[00:55:15.436 --> 00:55:17.757]  So she'd say, I'm going to ban all the semi-autos.
[00:55:18.018 --> 00:55:18.918]  Then Trump said, hell no.
[00:55:19.758 --> 00:55:20.739]  He just knows they're mentally ill.
[00:55:20.759 --> 00:55:21.319]  They can't help it.
[00:55:21.639 --> 00:55:25.140]  And so that's the same thing here, I'm told, is we know vaccine technology is real.
[00:55:25.181 --> 00:55:26.701]  We know they can create clean vaccines.
[00:55:26.921 --> 00:55:28.042]  They still have some side effects.
[00:55:28.082 --> 00:55:29.262]  They still can do it.
[00:55:29.382 --> 00:55:33.324]  But if you don't let them be adulterated or have something added on purpose,
[00:55:33.644 --> 00:55:37.865]  They're a lot better, just like elites that came out in China and Europe get, quote, clean vaccines.
[00:55:37.905 --> 00:55:39.106]  The rich people get them.
[00:55:39.546 --> 00:55:41.987]  We want that for the general public, and if you choose to take it, take it.
[00:55:42.247 --> 00:55:43.907]  So Trump took control from Gates.
[00:55:44.288 --> 00:55:48.969]  He took control of them trying to keep the country locked down, just psychologically, and you're absolutely right, that's what he's done.
[00:55:49.209 --> 00:55:54.791]  And they are now, we'll play the clip next segment, Kamala Harris has come out and said, I don't trust Trump, don't take the vaccine.
[00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:56.652]  So talk about playing them.
[00:55:56.872 --> 00:55:58.172]  This is 3D chess.
[00:55:58.572 --> 00:55:59.593]  This is 5D chess.
[00:55:59.613 --> 00:56:00.673]  This is mega-chumping.
[00:56:02.142 --> 00:56:02.822]  Absolutely right.
[00:56:02.942 --> 00:56:05.663]  Including CBS News, which I have appeared on recently.
[00:56:06.464 --> 00:56:07.664]  Actually, it's funny.
[00:56:07.704 --> 00:56:09.045]  I mean, you can manipulate these people.
[00:56:09.405 --> 00:56:16.748]  They had to push Bill Gates on the fact that the Moderna vaccine has over 80% of the people that got side effects from it.
[00:56:17.128 --> 00:56:18.588]  That was my next question.
[00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:19.549]  In fact, they're getting the clip.
[00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:22.050]  How is CBS coming out against Gates?
[00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:22.710]  What's going on here?
[00:56:23.871 --> 00:56:36.344]  Because their motive is to make sure that the vaccine doesn't come out before the election, so that they don't give Trump credit, so that they can use the pretext of you have to vote by mail, so that they can stretch the election out for several weeks after election day with the vote counting.
[00:56:36.384 --> 00:56:41.270]  Then they'll have a Dick Gatorship under Kamala, and brain damage Joe, and make us take it.
[00:56:42.628 --> 00:56:47.011]  Bill Gates was going too fast for their plan, they felt, and was getting out of hand.
[00:56:47.031 --> 00:56:51.634]  So you have CBS fighting against Bill Gates because they got their lines crossed.
[00:56:51.934 --> 00:57:02.121]  And so when you, as we do here, clip this stuff, save this stuff, preserve this stuff, and you show it one after the other, you show how we are basically just throwing
[00:57:03.301 --> 00:57:04.042]  Let's be clear.
[00:57:20.657 --> 00:57:35.701]  They did it 2D chess, or 1D, where they just planned it and said, we'll do this, we'll control the media with the Rockefeller Foundation ten years ago, but now they didn't think of all the butterfly effects and all the corollary systems, and now it's jackknifing, it's going cattywampus.
[00:57:36.974 --> 00:57:38.135]  That's always their arrogance.
[00:57:38.155 --> 00:57:40.076]  It was the same thing with the Hillary campaign last time.
[00:57:40.116 --> 00:57:41.897]  It's the same thing with the Biden campaign this time.
[00:57:41.957 --> 00:57:44.179]  And frankly, they rolled this out too soon.
[00:57:44.499 --> 00:57:47.801]  All of our viewers know that this is a scandemic now, okay?
[00:57:48.221 --> 00:57:52.804]  If they had launched coronavirus today, they might have had a better chance of influencing the election.
[00:57:53.044 --> 00:57:54.385]  Too many people are woken up now.
[00:57:54.445 --> 00:57:56.947]  They did not do this correctly because they didn't count on us.
[00:57:57.691 --> 00:57:58.051]  You're right.
[00:57:58.091 --> 00:57:58.391]  Okay.
[00:57:58.432 --> 00:57:58.652]  Wow.
[00:57:58.672 --> 00:57:59.352]  You're on fire.
[00:57:59.832 --> 00:58:01.854]  We're going to talk to you on the other side of this break.
[00:58:01.874 --> 00:58:05.316]  Please don't forget our websites are InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:58:05.696 --> 00:58:10.380]  This great article with the actual screenshots confirmed that COVID-19 was around years ago.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:13.862]  We have other articles confirming it, too, from the CDC itself.
[00:58:13.902 --> 00:58:14.482]  That's coming up.
[00:58:14.743 --> 00:58:18.805]  Patrick Howley is our guest at Howley Reporter on Twitter, NationalFile.com.
[00:58:19.166 --> 00:58:21.968]  He and Tom Papert and their crew do a fantastic job.
[00:58:23.112 --> 00:58:30.114]  I know you as listeners are aware of all this stuff, but just never forget, keep it in the front of your mind, the back of your mind, and deep in the heart of your gut.
[00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:33.814]  Without you telling folks about the live show, no one will know about this.
[00:58:34.294 --> 00:58:37.235]  People need to know that it's all going down, it's all unfolding.
[00:58:37.475 --> 00:58:38.595]  Tell them how to tune in right now.
[00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:39.356]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.636 --> 00:58:43.416]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Transmission.
[00:58:43.436 --> 00:58:45.497]  Please tell everybody you know to tune in now.
[00:58:46.037 --> 00:58:50.498]  Patrick Halley is a great investigative journalist who's often exposed to pedophile rings.
[00:58:52.065 --> 00:58:54.068]  The Globalist saw a lot of other big stories.
[00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:57.734]  Corruption and... He put out a big story.
[00:58:57.754 --> 00:58:59.557]  And this is all confirmed.
[00:58:59.577 --> 00:59:00.538]  You go right to the IMF.
[00:59:01.259 --> 00:59:02.381]  Right to the World Bank documents.
[00:59:02.541 --> 00:59:04.885]  World Bank records COVID-19 test kits.
[00:59:05.703 --> 00:59:06.143]  Exported in 2018.
[00:59:06.204 --> 00:59:13.190]  Well, we've got Reuters saying that they were picking up COVID-19 international tests, calling it that in March of 2019.
[00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:23.038]  And we've got Fauci and them with genetic scans of the virus, the exact same virus under other names, five years ago, illegally in the U.S., ordered to move it to China.
[00:59:23.639 --> 00:59:24.740]  And that's even in Newsweek.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:31.586]  So they're hoping this doesn't come out and get into it and how big this is.
[00:59:33.661 --> 00:59:37.662]  Alex, this has been planned for a long, long time.
[00:59:38.482 --> 00:59:50.426]  There is a reason why Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is supposedly this allergy bureaucrat, was there with Bill Gates Sr., who we know from your show, Alex, is longtime Planned Parenthood.
[00:59:50.446 --> 00:59:53.807]  He was on the board of Planned Parenthood prior to Roe v. Wade, longtime eugenicist.
[00:59:54.127 --> 00:59:55.067]  He was there with Ted Turner.
[00:59:55.107 --> 00:59:56.328]  He was there with George Soros.
[00:59:56.628 --> 00:59:57.788]  He was there with Tom Brokaw.
[00:59:58.008 --> 01:00:00.929]  He was there with Barbara Walters, David Rockefeller, Ted Turner.
[01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:07.451]  All of these folks, back in 2001, 2001, when this thing went into hyperdrive.
[01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:14.053]  Then 2003, the Stephen King-created television series, The Dead Zone, predictive program this entire thing.
[01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:15.714]  Why do they spell this all out?
[01:00:16.014 --> 01:00:27.998]  Because they think that their occultic rituals, their black magic, is more powerful if they telegraph to people what they are doing, and the people don't notice, and the people don't wake up.
[01:00:28.018 --> 01:00:29.058]  That's why Aleister Crowley
[01:00:29.358 --> 01:00:30.499]  Was on the cover of the Sgt.
[01:00:30.579 --> 01:00:32.620]  Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Beatles album.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:37.203]  That's why there's predictive programming in Hollywood telling us exactly what they're gonna do.
[01:00:37.243 --> 01:00:38.984]  And by the way, they admit all of this.
[01:00:39.004 --> 01:00:47.970]  We got the WikiLeaks and the top Democrats are worshipping Alistair Crowley and these horrible cowards and Lady Gaga and Ibramovic and all of these people.
[01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.133]  And Bill Gates admits he wants to depopulate us.
[01:00:51.393 --> 01:00:55.157]  And more importantly than his dad, his mother was on the IBM board and a big Nazi.
[01:00:55.497 --> 01:00:56.798]  So this is a monster creature.
[01:00:56.859 --> 01:00:58.720]  Who is Bill Gates for those that don't know him?
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.282]  He says he wants to kill everybody.
[01:01:00.542 --> 01:01:01.643]  He wants to kill old people.
[01:01:01.844 --> 01:01:04.066]  But he wants you to take a shot so you're safe.
[01:01:05.711 --> 01:01:16.100]  Yes, that's right, and it's too bad that Nancy Pelosi isn't wearing a mask when she goes to the salon because, you know, her husband has had a rough year with this scandemic.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:23.366]  He can't go to his Bohemian Grove ritual, so I wonder if he's going to be able to worship Malik via Skype or Zoom.
[01:01:24.673 --> 01:01:28.677]  Where do you think, let's look at this as a football game, but it's life and death.
[01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:30.759]  How's it going for the New World Order right now?
[01:01:31.099 --> 01:01:37.166]  How's it going where they've got to externalize, they're going to challenge the election no matter what, they're going to try to have secession of states.
[01:01:37.566 --> 01:01:40.289]  I mean, this is really, to me, a dying group of individuals.
[01:01:41.946 --> 01:01:43.887]  It is not going that well for them.
[01:01:43.907 --> 01:01:52.994]  There have been so many things that have complicated this plan, and so many of those things have come from the world of citizen journalism, not from the fake media.
[01:01:53.054 --> 01:02:00.559]  They were so arrogant, and they continuously underestimate us, because they underestimate everyone, because they truly have contempt for us.
[01:02:00.599 --> 01:02:02.500]  They believe that we are animalistic.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:03.241]  We're below them.
[01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:03.861]  And
[01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:32.330]  Is going to repel the majority that right now they have.
[01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.770]  They have so many normies right now.
[01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:37.832]  They have so many women and people who have gone through public school system.
[01:02:37.852 --> 01:02:41.474]  They have a lot of soft followers that have become very soft off America's largess.
[01:02:42.856 --> 01:02:52.340]  Yes, but if they push this thing to a point where we cross the threshold and we don't have America anymore in two months' time, that will backfire on them.
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:53.320]  No, no, I agree.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:58.602]  They thought taking everything away would make people be scared and hate Trump.
[01:02:58.702 --> 01:03:00.323]  Everyone knows that the Democrats did this.
[01:03:00.363 --> 01:03:01.283]  Even Democrats know that.
[01:03:02.163 --> 01:03:03.964]  So it's really backfiring.
[01:03:05.552 --> 01:03:08.513]  It is, and there's not enough people who have Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:03:08.633 --> 01:03:19.479]  Even the lefties who attack us, even the lefties who come out of the woodwork and recite the talking points or call me a Russian agent or whatever it is they say that comes down from David Brock's creative writing seminars.
[01:03:20.699 --> 01:03:23.681]  David Brock doing the lines of Coke, reportedly.
[01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:28.284]  The people are not accepting it.
[01:03:28.324 --> 01:03:30.186]  They're rejecting it.
[01:03:30.266 --> 01:03:46.640]  And so, right now is really a turning point where I think everything that you have been trying to do for so many decades in exposing the 2D narrative, exposing how the deep state is creative writers who write this stuff out, Ben Rhodes, David Brock, the Creative Writing Corp.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:54.643]  People are beginning to understand it now, and this contested election will wake up more people than anything in history, and so we have one opportunity now.
[01:03:54.663 --> 01:03:57.164]  I totally haven't explained that, because they admit they're a bunch of writers.
[01:03:57.664 --> 01:04:01.786]  Even Karl Rove said that, oh, we're history's writers now, we control reality.
[01:04:01.826 --> 01:04:13.571]  But once Hollywood falls, once they fall, once people don't buy the narratives, it's like the Emperor's New Clothes, it's like Wizard of Oz, when Toto pulls back the curtain, and they just can't believe that no one believes them anymore.
[01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.590]  Absolutely.
[01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.512]  And Hollywood is losing relevance.
[01:04:17.552 --> 01:04:22.499]  Hollywood still gets a lot of astroturfed views on their YouTube videos, which is all manipulated.
[01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:28.206]  And it goes mostly to teenagers and young people who live in modernity and the parents are a little bit trapped out.
[01:04:28.226 --> 01:04:28.566]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:04:28.586 --> 01:04:29.848]  Having a bunch of zombies doesn't count.
[01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:30.849]  We have the thinkers.
[01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:32.732]  They have the zombies.
[01:04:34.389 --> 01:04:34.629]  Right.
[01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:36.931]  And so, and that's okay.
[01:04:36.951 --> 01:04:38.172]  There's always going to be zombies.
[01:04:38.192 --> 01:04:39.633]  There's always going to be a normie class.
[01:04:39.673 --> 01:04:40.574]  There's always going to be that.
[01:04:40.594 --> 01:04:42.095]  We're not globalists that want to kill all of them.
[01:04:42.135 --> 01:04:45.418]  We're just saying they don't count because they want to sit there and be idiots.
[01:04:47.099 --> 01:04:47.340]  Right.
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:56.507]  And so, you know, on the level that we need to operate at, we are beginning to, I think we're beginning to make big, big progress.
[01:04:56.527 --> 01:05:01.671]  You see it because, I mean, even the FBI can't ignore the Pelosi family scams anymore.
[01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:03.673]  I talked to two associates of
[01:05:04.193 --> 01:05:10.476]  Nancy Pelosi's son, the FBI, came to one of his, the guy's house, knocked on his door, said, where's Paul Pelosi Jr.?
[01:05:10.516 --> 01:05:11.397]  Where is whereabouts?
[01:05:12.237 --> 01:05:17.660]  There is a pushback against these people, even within the military, even within some elements of the deep state.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.161]  People are like, enough is enough.
[01:05:19.201 --> 01:05:21.562]  These people are leading us off a cliff to Armageddon.
[01:05:21.842 --> 01:05:22.743]  Well, here's an example.
[01:05:23.343 --> 01:05:26.565]  They've been beating the drum now for three months that the military is going to remove Trump.
[01:05:27.365 --> 01:05:29.847]  And of course, we knew they were canvassing behind the scenes and first raised the alarm.
[01:05:29.867 --> 01:05:31.387]  Just pointing out, we don't make this stuff up, folks.
[01:05:34.602 --> 01:05:39.203]  Then the Joint Chiefs came out a week and a half ago and said, that's illegal, that's treason, we will not be part of that.
[01:05:39.563 --> 01:05:43.144]  And Bill Clinton's still running around going, the military's going to remove Trump.
[01:05:43.744 --> 01:05:50.205]  They're still hoping with their black magic, with their Aleister Crowley stuff, that it's magically going to happen.
[01:05:51.585 --> 01:05:57.887]  And I think what they're beginning to realize is that there is not a supernatural element to the things that they do.
[01:05:57.967 --> 01:06:00.167]  I do not believe that Lucifer... No, I agree.
[01:06:00.187 --> 01:06:02.328]  People were asleep, that's how they got away with it.
[01:06:02.568 --> 01:06:04.268]  Now the magic's gone because we're awake.
[01:06:05.692 --> 01:06:05.972]  Yes.
[01:06:06.253 --> 01:06:07.514]  And that's what the wizardry is.
[01:06:07.594 --> 01:06:08.955]  It's not a supernatural thing.
[01:06:08.995 --> 01:06:13.919]  I do believe that Lucifer might exist, but their wizardry is all about Hollywood.
[01:06:13.959 --> 01:06:15.301]  It's all about putting things on the screen.
[01:06:15.341 --> 01:06:16.442]  It's all about dumbing us down.
[01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:20.565]  And there are some people at the top who realize that there was never a supernatural element to it.
[01:06:20.805 --> 01:06:25.730]  But the dupes, the ones in the middle, like Epstein, like Bill and Hillary Clinton, they're operatives.
[01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:31.074]  They were duped all along thinking, oh wow, Lucifer is, you know, guiding all of this.
[01:06:31.334 --> 01:06:38.199]  And now I think they're beginning to realize that it was the Wizard of Oz behind the, you know, whatever, the whole time.
[01:06:38.419 --> 01:06:46.985]  And the Wizard of Oz was David Rockefeller and Bill Gates and these kinds of sinister folks who knew the entire time that they were pulling a fast one on all these people.
[01:06:47.005 --> 01:06:50.167]  Yeah, I've even noticed the body language on CNN.
[01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:50.788]  We can play this.
[01:06:51.548 --> 01:06:59.235]  And on CBS everywhere is they're now not kissing Gates's ass, they're like laughing at him and giving him dirty looks because they know every one of their family hates him now.
[01:06:59.295 --> 01:07:00.896]  He's like the most hated person on earth.
[01:07:01.497 --> 01:07:12.005]  Wow, let's talk about that ladies and gentlemen on the other side and then let's get into the election, the rioting, the left escalating into full-on civil war with Patrick Howley.
[01:07:12.066 --> 01:07:15.669]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, but the biggest vaccine news ever
[01:07:16.289 --> 01:07:17.910]  Breaking from the UN itself.
[01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:20.992]  Remember their own scientist came out last year and said what we're doing is wrong.
[01:07:21.312 --> 01:07:22.413]  Maybe they have a soul.
[01:07:25.054 --> 01:07:30.817]  Since I mentioned it, here's Kamala Harris saying she wouldn't trust a vaccine now that Trump's pushing it.
[01:07:31.138 --> 01:07:32.398]  Perfect reverse psychology.
[01:07:32.418 --> 01:07:33.119]  They just took the bait.
[01:07:33.139 --> 01:07:33.539]  There it is.
[01:07:34.039 --> 01:07:39.142]  So let's just say there's a vaccine that is approved and even distributed before the election.
[01:07:39.162 --> 01:07:40.263]  Would you get it?
[01:07:41.041 --> 01:07:44.042]  Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us.
[01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:49.523]  I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump.
[01:07:50.603 --> 01:08:00.925]  And it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he's talking about.
[01:08:01.005 --> 01:08:02.206]  I will not take his word for it.
[01:08:02.266 --> 01:08:03.946]  He wants us to inject bleach.
[01:08:03.966 --> 01:08:05.386]  No, I will not take his word for it.
[01:08:05.406 --> 01:08:06.467]  Never said that, you liar.
[01:08:07.367 --> 01:08:08.127]  Okay, so.
[01:08:10.276 --> 01:08:18.541]  I was in the coffee room with Owen Schroer about four months ago and he said, you know, I know we don't do reverse psychology, but maybe Trump should come out for the vaccines.
[01:08:19.502 --> 01:08:20.963]  I said, that's a very dangerous game.
[01:08:21.023 --> 01:08:22.644]  He did that with the, with the gun stuff.
[01:08:23.344 --> 01:08:26.646]  And even though he didn't say I'm for the gun control, he said, tell me what you want.
[01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:27.347]  We'll probably do it.
[01:08:28.246 --> 01:08:30.267]  And then he got her to reveal herself and that blew up in her face.
[01:08:30.287 --> 01:08:31.308]  I mean, I was let in on that.
[01:08:31.788 --> 01:08:34.269]  I'm not trying to brag, just on key things Trump's smart.
[01:08:34.289 --> 01:08:37.010]  It's like, let Jones know this is, I'm manipulating these people.
[01:08:37.331 --> 01:08:39.252]  That's why they're so pissed, because he is smarter than them.
[01:08:39.712 --> 01:08:40.872]  But it's a very dangerous game.
[01:08:44.793 --> 01:08:51.796]  The question is, what is it like to see Bill Gates say, I want to depopulate the earth, but now I want to give you a shot.
[01:08:52.316 --> 01:08:54.617]  Now I want to put something in your body, and he's not even a doctor.
[01:08:55.217 --> 01:09:02.680]  And then now they've been tricked from saying it's safe and effective to admitting that, oh, it's really dangerous, something Trump first said.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:06.302]  I mean, if anything's 3, 4, 5-D chess, this is it, Patrick.
[01:09:06.482 --> 01:09:07.782]  I don't mean to go back to another subject.
[01:09:07.822 --> 01:09:09.803]  I've got plenty of subjects to cover, but this is crazy.
[01:09:11.007 --> 01:09:15.850]  And we've made Kamala Harris, an establishment politician, an anti-vaxxer, which is fascinating.
[01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:19.532]  This issue cuts across all lines.
[01:09:20.852 --> 01:09:28.356]  I was just at a store and there was a young black man who was laughing along with me when I was making fun of Bill Gates in front of everyone, as I always do.
[01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:30.878]  I make a scene wherever I go now when I don't wear a mask.
[01:09:31.318 --> 01:09:31.438]  Yeah.
[01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:59.043]  And even the empty talking heads that turns out Bill Gates paid a couple hundred million dollars to those networks to promote him, they even diss him on air because they know he's a mentally ill, eugenicist, crazy person that everyone turned against.
[01:09:59.103 --> 01:10:01.965]  I mean, wow, they must know the real numbers.
[01:10:01.985 --> 01:10:03.205]  I know they've got a lot of schematics.
[01:10:03.225 --> 01:10:03.806]  What do you think?
[01:10:03.946 --> 01:10:06.888]  Is Gates the most unpopular person in modern history now?
[01:10:08.234 --> 01:10:08.795]  Absolutely.
[01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:10.177]  He's losing power.
[01:10:10.257 --> 01:10:11.739]  He's finally losing power.
[01:10:11.759 --> 01:10:21.994]  And you have to understand, since our money isn't really backed up by anything, their power through finance is also illusionary in terms of... It's faith in it.
[01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:22.335]  Absolutely.
[01:10:22.415 --> 01:10:23.116]  It's all about faith.
[01:10:24.258 --> 01:10:32.284]  Yeah, and if there is an economic reset or if there's a big disturbance like the kind they are bringing about, then they will lose power.
[01:10:32.324 --> 01:10:35.606]  They will strip themselves of their own power because of their arrogance and their stupidity.
[01:10:35.646 --> 01:10:37.087]  Well, that's what I think.
[01:10:37.368 --> 01:10:38.628]  Patrick, I don't think I know.
[01:10:39.209 --> 01:10:40.570]  They implemented this out of panic.
[01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.171]  Now they're even more panicked.
[01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:45.774]  My concern is what may they pull next to get out of this?
[01:10:45.814 --> 01:10:48.736]  Because they keep like degenerate gamblers just doubling down here.
[01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.630]  Yep.
[01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:54.453]  The riots are now being counteracted by Trump and the federal government.
[01:10:54.633 --> 01:10:57.975]  The mask thing is overreach.
[01:10:58.035 --> 01:10:59.276]  Everybody knows that it's overreach.
[01:10:59.316 --> 01:11:02.138]  Only Antifa wants people to go around and wear masks at this point.
[01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:03.839]  And there are mask burnings.
[01:11:03.879 --> 01:11:05.140]  There are anti-mask rallies.
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.380]  People are against them.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.243]  They're finally waking up that it's humanity against the insect people.
[01:11:10.283 --> 01:11:11.344]  And I don't mean that literally.
[01:11:11.384 --> 01:11:15.586]  They're just very, very misguided, delusional elitists here on planet Earth.
[01:11:15.606 --> 01:11:15.866]  Sociopathic.
[01:11:15.926 --> 01:11:16.827]  Yes, sociopathic.
[01:11:17.227 --> 01:11:18.928]  But finally, we have
[01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:24.072]  We've done what I thought Trump was always going to do as soon as he first ran.
[01:11:24.332 --> 01:11:30.137]  And we've gotten to the point where we've basically broken down the right versus left paradigm that they keep us locked in on cable news.
[01:11:30.417 --> 01:11:33.559]  And we've gotten to a point where it is humanity against the social controllers.
[01:11:33.819 --> 01:11:44.547]  And I knew Trump being a brilliant guy, even if he didn't necessarily see that this was all going to go down the way that it is, he navigating this has helped us to get to this point.
[01:11:44.647 --> 01:11:46.288]  He's like a jazz player.
[01:11:46.449 --> 01:11:48.210]  He knows how to roll with the punches.
[01:11:49.517 --> 01:11:50.277]  He does, yes.
[01:11:50.997 --> 01:11:53.158]  It's brilliant to watch, and it's fascinating to watch.
[01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:58.820]  And he has the right people around him, like Peter Navarro and Mark Meadows, thankfully, who are plugged into what he's doing.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:03.721]  What are they going to do when he wins in a landslide, which they already admit their internal numbers show?
[01:12:03.761 --> 01:12:08.483]  People still need to vote, though, folks, because we're going to have to... Because at first, it looked like we won, but they're going to bring in all the fake ballots.
[01:12:08.503 --> 01:12:11.404]  We've got to have a huge, huge landslide to beat that, in my view.
[01:12:11.564 --> 01:12:12.184]  Is that your view?
[01:12:13.064 --> 01:12:15.186]  They admit they're going to pull secession, rioting.
[01:12:15.647 --> 01:12:17.088]  What does Trump do at that point?
[01:12:17.148 --> 01:12:22.373]  Because then you can't have the military and police stand down when they're burning everything down to destroy the dollar.
[01:12:22.393 --> 01:12:24.235]  Because they admit their next thing is destroy the dollar.
[01:12:24.556 --> 01:12:32.764]  And I just want the Democrats to know, if everybody actually goes bankrupt and our dollars worthless and we go into a civil war, I mean, you're going to be blamed jerks, not Trump.
[01:12:32.844 --> 01:12:34.646]  I mean, people are going to be pissed, man.
[01:12:36.232 --> 01:12:43.459]  Every election since 2014, I've been in some kind of a war room, and I've always caught their shenanigans because I see them developing before other people.
[01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:46.282]  In 2016, they were going to withhold Milwaukee.
[01:12:46.482 --> 01:12:48.464]  Oh, well, there's a problem in Milwaukee.
[01:12:48.504 --> 01:12:50.786]  We might not get the results tonight, right?
[01:12:51.207 --> 01:12:52.448]  You have to monitor CNN.
[01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:54.410]  You have to monitor what they're doing in real time.
[01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:58.935]  Florida, they announced on Fox News, Ron DeSantis wins.
[01:12:59.195 --> 01:13:03.099]  Then all of a sudden I get a call, oh, they're gonna mess everything up in Broward County.
[01:13:03.319 --> 01:13:03.800]  What happens?
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.385]  It drags on in Broward County, Florida, where they're pushing ballots through the airport late at night.
[01:13:08.725 --> 01:13:17.155]  It drags on in Georgia, and our people had to go down there and win for the GOP in Georgia because Stacey Abrams was finding all these votes in Fulton County.
[01:13:17.535 --> 01:13:20.157]  So this time they've had four years to plan this out.
[01:13:20.177 --> 01:13:24.801]  Stacey Abrams is still involved in their strategic, you know, what they're doing.
[01:13:25.161 --> 01:13:28.444]  The Obama machine is much more involved this time than they were last time.
[01:13:28.484 --> 01:13:30.786]  They sat last one out basically because they didn't like Hillary.
[01:13:31.126 --> 01:13:36.530]  This time you've got the Obama people running it who are the most deceptive people in the world and a little bit smarter than Hillary.
[01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:42.114]  And what they're going to do is they're going to call down to CNN and they're going to say, hey Wolf, you're not going to call this tonight.
[01:13:42.315 --> 01:13:45.497]  There's no way in heck that Wolf Blitzer is going to call this tonight.
[01:13:45.857 --> 01:13:46.538]  I don't like Fox
[01:13:46.618 --> 01:13:48.199]  They've already put out the pre-talking point.
[01:13:48.259 --> 01:13:49.140]  Do not call it.
[01:13:49.441 --> 01:13:50.281]  They're going to drag it out.
[01:13:50.341 --> 01:13:50.842]  Period.
[01:13:51.943 --> 01:13:52.103]  Yep.
[01:13:52.403 --> 01:13:55.846]  So that's why you need Fox News to call it, but Fox News isn't going to, I don't think.
[01:13:56.187 --> 01:14:01.792]  And then, you know, OANN... And Google says they will not carry anyone, including Trump's announcement of victory.
[01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:09.258]  I mean, you talk about like a proletariat, or like the Politburo, not the proletariat, the Politburo, sitting up and deciding who gets in.
[01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:09.939]  This is crazy.
[01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:15.737]  Yep, and Alex, you've got to do an election night show because you have got to counteract these people.
[01:14:15.777 --> 01:14:17.462]  Don't worry, we're going to be on the air then.
[01:14:18.524 --> 01:14:19.045]  God willing.
[01:14:21.345 --> 01:14:29.551]  There's this girl at Breitbart who is the deputy managing editor who they plugged in in the last weeks of the election last time, trying to get Breitbart to call the election for Hillary early that night.
[01:14:29.611 --> 01:14:30.952]  It all happens in real time.
[01:14:31.172 --> 01:14:31.713]  It's a fight.
[01:14:31.953 --> 01:14:33.534]  It's a real fight against these people.
[01:14:33.554 --> 01:14:41.560]  Well no, as soon as it shows he's got the electoral numbers, as soon as it shows majority of votes, Talley will say protected Trump win, and we'll call it when we really think it is.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.262]  And obviously, all the real numbers show he's totally delivered.
[01:14:44.282 --> 01:14:45.663]  They've seen the attack, the Russia game.
[01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:47.905]  He's fabulously popular.
[01:14:48.385 --> 01:14:49.587]  Americans don't like being bullied.
[01:14:49.607 --> 01:14:56.560]  It's like Hitler bombing London to make them give up and it made it go from 90% against the war to 98% for a new war.
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.225]  I don't know why does the left think bullying always works.
[01:14:59.285 --> 01:15:00.127]  I just don't understand it.
[01:15:01.641 --> 01:15:07.927]  And they haven't set up their apparatus to even prepare for what happens once they destabilize this country.
[01:15:07.967 --> 01:15:14.493]  They think that they've pumped out enough hate out there and they have enough money that, whatever, just let it burn and we'll see if America can go down organically.
[01:15:14.513 --> 01:15:14.773]  Well, exactly.
[01:15:14.793 --> 01:15:17.776]  They'll just fly off in private jets and just see if it works.
[01:15:17.796 --> 01:15:21.380]  But next time, the globalists in Soros, there's now criminal investigations.
[01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:23.782]  They need to pay for what they've done.
[01:15:25.598 --> 01:15:40.726]  That's absolutely right, and by the way, I'm breaking a story about how Nancy Pelosi rented office space to California First Five, which was chaired by Rob Reiner, of all people, Meathead, and the legendary pedophile William Ayers was the figurehead of this group.
[01:15:40.806 --> 01:15:41.446]  I have the lease.
[01:15:42.087 --> 01:15:42.807]  It's all coming out.
[01:15:43.007 --> 01:15:44.068]  It's all going to come out this week.
[01:15:44.088 --> 01:15:45.889]  Oh yeah, Rob Reiner works behind the scenes.
[01:15:47.287 --> 01:15:52.494]  Yeah, Tom Pappert and I are doing an anti-mask rally that's going to make worldwide headlines on Tuesday morning.
[01:15:52.534 --> 01:15:53.415]  Very peaceful, by the way.
[01:15:53.455 --> 01:15:54.376]  Very peaceful rally.
[01:15:54.556 --> 01:15:57.820]  It's going to kick off the greatest week in the history of independent journalism.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.763]  And I'm proud to call you my brother, Alex Jones.
[01:15:59.783 --> 01:16:00.183]  You're a great man.
[01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:00.624]  You too, brother.
[01:16:00.644 --> 01:16:01.745]  Where is that demonstration going to be?
[01:16:03.167 --> 01:16:04.889]  It's going to be in the great state of Kansas.
[01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:06.071]  In Wichita.
[01:16:07.278 --> 01:16:07.598]  That's right.
[01:16:08.219 --> 01:16:10.081]  Where I'm on the local TV station that Pappert runs.
[01:16:10.662 --> 01:16:11.482]  Pappert's awesome.
[01:16:11.623 --> 01:16:12.924]  We call him Emperor Pappert Team.
[01:16:12.944 --> 01:16:14.005]  All right, brother.
[01:16:14.065 --> 01:16:15.126]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:16:15.146 --> 01:16:15.727]  We really appreciate it.
[01:16:15.747 --> 01:16:17.909]  Patrick Howley at Howley Reporter on Twitter.
[01:16:17.949 --> 01:16:18.250]  Thank you.
[01:16:19.251 --> 01:16:19.571]  Thank you.
[01:16:20.392 --> 01:16:20.712]  Okay.
[01:16:21.413 --> 01:16:25.637]  We've got Owen Schroer coming in the final segment to tell us what's coming up in the two hours he's going to do.
[01:16:26.724 --> 01:16:26.984]  of course.
[01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:54.897]  How about sharing the next two hours, and when this show archives, in the next 30 minutes or so, to InfoWars.com or to Bandai Video, how about you share this feed?
[01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.559]  That's how we defeat the globalists.
[01:16:56.599 --> 01:16:57.539]  That's how the dog hunts.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.981]  That's how we crush the globalists.
[01:16:59.041 --> 01:17:02.304]  We're going to defeat them, but it's going to take energy, and I know you're going to do it, so thank you.
[01:17:03.324 --> 01:17:04.285]  Hello, my friends.
[01:17:04.305 --> 01:17:05.606]  This is George Soros.
[01:17:06.707 --> 01:17:08.088]  I made happy making of Hitler.
[01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:16.388]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:17.409 --> 01:17:22.995]  Whatever you do, do what my son Alexander Soros says.
[01:17:23.776 --> 01:17:27.521]  We know you're weak, and we're going to get you Americans.
[01:17:29.336 --> 01:17:30.057]  Owen Troyer's here.
[01:17:30.077 --> 01:17:33.799]  He's about to take over for two hours live with the new show, Sunday Live.
[01:17:33.819 --> 01:17:35.601]  And I said, what's front and center for you?
[01:17:35.621 --> 01:17:36.841]  You've got some compilations.
[01:17:36.922 --> 01:17:43.886]  I mean, Joe Biden has gone from being a bumbling, fumbling, stroke-addled idiot for the last two years to collapsing it.
[01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:45.367]  He doesn't even know where he is.
[01:17:45.468 --> 01:17:48.129]  That's my wife.
[01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:50.951]  I mean, I said this six months ago.
[01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:51.212]  I said,
[01:17:52.092 --> 01:17:55.174]  By the election, he'll be a vegetable at the current decline rate.
[01:17:55.635 --> 01:17:58.697]  When you put it all together, Alex, it's really telling.
[01:17:58.917 --> 01:18:06.582]  And we tend, you know, because the news cycle is so crazy these days and everything moves so fast, we tend to not look at the overall picture.
[01:18:06.622 --> 01:18:16.649]  But when you look at him from the debates all the way through to now, and we've got some compilations and we'll pull up some videos tonight, the Sunday Night Live election countdown, we're going to take a lot of your phone calls too, like we do every Sunday.
[01:18:17.029 --> 01:18:17.870]  Tons of phone calls.
[01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:20.792]  And since we don't have the normal breaks, plenty of time to get to all of them.
[01:18:21.132 --> 01:18:25.737]  But when you put it all together, Alex, it just shows that it has been a slow creep.
[01:18:26.157 --> 01:18:27.178]  It's getting worse.
[01:18:27.859 --> 01:18:31.442]  It really looks to the point now where you look at a guy that doesn't even want to win.
[01:18:31.502 --> 01:18:37.909]  I mean, you're looking at a guy who just feels like he's going up there, reading off a script, like, okay, like, uh, like, do you even want to be president?
[01:18:37.929 --> 01:18:39.270]  Do you even know you want to be president?
[01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:40.511]  Like, do you even know what's going on?
[01:18:41.112 --> 01:18:47.754]  And so, meanwhile, Trump, on the other hand, has, I think, three different record boat parades over the weekend.
[01:18:47.774 --> 01:18:54.537]  I think Georgia, Florida, there was another one here in Lake Austin, some of the boats... So big in Austin they sunk, because the waves got so big.
[01:18:54.877 --> 01:18:59.098]  Well, yeah, because... I know that part, they were going through a part where it's not that wide.
[01:18:59.118 --> 01:19:01.739]  It's too narrow, right, and the wakes... It wasn't good.
[01:19:01.759 --> 01:19:03.180]  I think seven vessels sunk.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:06.441]  Seven vessels sunk because the Trump... That's where I got my finger cut off.
[01:19:06.841 --> 01:19:11.063]  Because it was too busy a day too, like 15 summers ago, and a big wave hit him.
[01:19:11.203 --> 01:19:12.623]  I fell off and my finger got cut off.
[01:19:13.384 --> 01:19:14.724]  And the motor spinning on the back?
[01:19:14.824 --> 01:19:15.845]  No, it wasn't that.
[01:19:16.065 --> 01:19:17.765]  I was helping a barge and then a big wave hit.
[01:19:17.805 --> 01:19:19.326]  But I mean, that's what happens.
[01:19:19.586 --> 01:19:21.147]  I've never seen action like that busy.
[01:19:22.205 --> 01:19:27.112]  And you know, we've been out there too, Alex, on the 4th and other holidays, and it gets really choppy, it gets really crowded.
[01:19:27.232 --> 01:19:27.973]  Seven vessels.
[01:19:28.034 --> 01:19:28.935]  Never seen a vessel sink.
[01:19:29.456 --> 01:19:30.437]  Seven vessels.
[01:19:30.537 --> 01:19:33.241]  And the media spun that like, look, it's a sign he's going down.
[01:19:33.261 --> 01:19:34.843]  In other words, 5,000 boats.
[01:19:34.863 --> 01:19:37.647]  No, Alex, here's what I'm saying.
[01:19:39.148 --> 01:19:44.311]  People are so excited and so desperate to show their support for Trump, they're like, HELL TO MY VESSEL!
[01:19:44.612 --> 01:19:46.192]  I'M GOING DOWN!
[01:19:46.393 --> 01:19:47.173]  DAMN THE VESSEL!
[01:19:47.233 --> 01:19:48.614]  I'M SHOWING SUPPORT FOR TRUMP!
[01:19:48.694 --> 01:19:49.374]  I GOT MY FLAT!
[01:19:49.394 --> 01:19:50.875]  It's like, that's how crazy it is.
[01:19:50.935 --> 01:19:53.477]  It's reached, it's fanatical, Alex.
[01:19:53.877 --> 01:19:54.457]  It's fanatical.
[01:19:54.497 --> 01:19:57.759]  The support of Trump is fanatical beyond anything I've ever seen.
[01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:58.800]  Beyond anything I've ever seen.
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:01.901]  It's like a movie, and Joe Biden is like a fart in the wind.
[01:20:01.921 --> 01:20:03.342]  Well, I talked to folks that live out the lake.
[01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:06.144]  They said, literally, on the big part of the lake, he was just like,
[01:20:06.724 --> 01:20:08.485]  Fourth of July was not even 10% of this.
[01:20:08.525 --> 01:20:09.786]  They said it was solid boats.
[01:20:10.326 --> 01:20:11.046]  But Alex, think about it.
[01:20:11.887 --> 01:20:13.968]  They know it's a landslide coming for Trump.
[01:20:14.008 --> 01:20:16.269]  I mean, at this point, it's elementary.
[01:20:16.649 --> 01:20:18.691]  My buddy Shane Stoddard and his red helicopter.
[01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:20.592]  They were out there too.
[01:20:20.712 --> 01:20:20.992]  Look at her.
[01:20:21.012 --> 01:20:21.612]  She's screaming.
[01:20:21.632 --> 01:20:23.233]  She's like, four more years!
[01:20:24.094 --> 01:20:26.175]  See the waves it causes when there's those big cabin cruisers?
[01:20:26.735 --> 01:20:29.898]  Because there were like thousands of giant ones, it was like, oh lord.
[01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:32.740]  So this is the fanatical level of the Trump support.
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:36.243]  He shows up in Pennsylvania the other day, 10,000 overflow on a 24-hour announced event.
[01:20:39.366 --> 01:20:43.789]  You know, Biden announces three days, three days before he goes to Kenosha.
[01:20:43.829 --> 01:20:44.809]  Look at the boats!
[01:20:45.329 --> 01:20:45.530]  Yeah.
[01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:46.930]  Man, we gotta do this again.
[01:20:47.211 --> 01:20:50.212]  Alex, this was in Florida, this was in Georgia, this was in Texas.
[01:20:50.793 --> 01:20:51.433]  It was everywhere.
[01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:54.114]  No, I'm saying there were multiple events just like this.
[01:20:54.775 --> 01:20:55.695]  Everywhere over the weekend.
[01:20:55.795 --> 01:20:56.916]  Look at the helicopters.
[01:20:57.016 --> 01:20:58.357]  I bet they'll be tomorrow.
[01:20:58.377 --> 01:21:00.098]  Who's the Congressional Medal of Honor winner?
[01:21:00.138 --> 01:21:01.619]  He flies around with shame, the Dakota fellow.
[01:21:02.119 --> 01:21:14.307]  I think one of them had some sort of a Trump flag, or American flag, because there was some lefty that was on their apartment or something, he was all mad, like, the Trump supporters out there with their helicopters, look at them with their helicopters.
[01:21:14.667 --> 01:21:16.309]  Anyways.
[01:21:17.169 --> 01:21:18.350]  But that's, I mean, again, Kenosha Joe.
[01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:19.030]  What were you doing there?
[01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:20.011]  I was up here on air.
[01:21:20.471 --> 01:21:21.192]  Kenosha Joe.
[01:21:21.212 --> 01:21:23.253]  Were you lollygagging, lavishing yourself?
[01:21:23.593 --> 01:21:24.314]  No, no.
[01:21:24.334 --> 01:21:25.495]  You only work six days a week?
[01:21:26.269 --> 01:21:27.550]  I know, I'm a lazy bum.
[01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:33.075]  And now I'm daring to organize the crew to, in fact, go to Barton Creek tomorrow for another swim.
[01:21:33.155 --> 01:21:33.755]  You should come out.
[01:21:33.995 --> 01:21:38.319]  I am announcing, I am announcing that we're having another cruise next Saturday.
[01:21:38.759 --> 01:21:39.880]  Everybody's going to want to have it.
[01:21:40.321 --> 01:21:41.302]  This time we're going out.
[01:21:41.382 --> 01:21:42.903]  Trump boat parade next Saturday?
[01:21:42.943 --> 01:21:44.704]  We'll go live, absolutely.
[01:21:44.744 --> 01:21:45.305]  Next Saturday?
[01:21:45.545 --> 01:21:46.065]  Next Saturday.
[01:21:46.326 --> 01:21:48.127]  So that would be, what would that be guys?
[01:21:48.167 --> 01:21:49.769]  September 10th, I think?
[01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.949]  Let's do it again.
[01:21:50.969 --> 01:21:54.753]  I'm scared to go out there on my little boat though, God.
[01:21:59.019 --> 01:22:02.261]  We should get one of those party barges that has like the water slide and everything.
[01:22:02.281 --> 01:22:02.602]  Yeah.
[01:22:02.622 --> 01:22:03.522]  You know what I'm talking about?
[01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:03.983]  That little one?
[01:22:04.363 --> 01:22:06.385]  Yeah, we'll get one of those.
[01:22:06.445 --> 01:22:07.125]  I'm not kidding.
[01:22:07.145 --> 01:22:09.247]  We're going to have... You're going to get that party barge?
[01:22:09.367 --> 01:22:11.129]  It's going to start at what, 2 p.m.?
[01:22:12.069 --> 01:22:13.851]  Saturday, September.
[01:22:13.891 --> 01:22:14.611]  Guys, we need to get it.
[01:22:14.992 --> 01:22:15.872]  Saturday, September 12th.
[01:22:17.313 --> 01:22:21.116]  Saturday, September 12th, the Trump boat parade.
[01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.237]  Party barge!
[01:22:22.277 --> 01:22:24.259]  Let me call Shane Steiner up.
[01:22:24.299 --> 01:22:25.480]  Party barge!
[01:22:26.081 --> 01:22:27.121]  Can you imagine?
[01:22:27.522 --> 01:22:28.463]  Oh my gosh!
[01:22:29.203 --> 01:22:32.686]  Is that InfoWars and Alex Jones on a party barge?
[01:22:33.127 --> 01:22:33.567]  Oh my gosh!
[01:22:33.967 --> 01:22:34.728]  Oh my gosh!
[01:22:35.168 --> 01:22:38.151]  I just saw Alex Jones on a party barge!
[01:22:38.691 --> 01:22:40.353]  I meant to call him to ask about how the thing was.
[01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:41.734]  Let's see the answers.
[01:22:44.804 --> 01:22:45.445]  We'll see if he answers.
[01:22:45.525 --> 01:22:46.666]  We've got Joe Rogan up next.
[01:22:46.706 --> 01:22:47.767]  You never know what happens here.
[01:22:47.787 --> 01:22:48.727]  We'll see if he answers.
[01:22:49.328 --> 01:22:51.410]  You just get a phone call from Alex Jones, live on air.
[01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:52.171]  He usually answers.
[01:22:52.211 --> 01:22:52.671]  We'll see if he does.
[01:22:52.691 --> 01:22:53.972]  He might be flying around with his helicopter.
[01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:55.053]  He doesn't even drive cars now.
[01:22:55.073 --> 01:22:56.895]  He may just take a call on the helicopter, you know.
[01:22:57.956 --> 01:22:58.196]  Hey.
[01:22:58.576 --> 01:22:59.157]  Hey, I'm sorry.
[01:22:59.177 --> 01:23:00.118]  Hey, I'm live on air.
[01:23:00.158 --> 01:23:00.798]  Shane, how you doing?
[01:23:01.539 --> 01:23:01.899]  I'm good.
[01:23:01.919 --> 01:23:02.259]  How are you?
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:02.620]  Good.
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:04.742]  I meant to call you, then I forgot to do it yesterday.
[01:23:04.982 --> 01:23:07.444]  Was that your red helicopter I saw at that giant thing at the lake?
[01:23:08.185 --> 01:23:08.705]  Yeah, it was.
[01:23:09.246 --> 01:23:10.166]  Well, you're on air, buddy.
[01:23:10.186 --> 01:23:10.927]  Sorry to spring this on you.
[01:23:10.947 --> 01:23:11.728]  Can you talk for a second?
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.981]  Show's almost over, just tell us what it was like.
[01:23:16.441 --> 01:23:19.342]  Man, I'll tell you, that was an amazing day.
[01:23:19.362 --> 01:23:23.564]  I mean, to see all those people out there just happy, having fun.
[01:23:24.744 --> 01:23:26.905]  It was really amazing.
[01:23:27.405 --> 01:23:30.066]  Have you ever seen that many boats in the lake?
[01:23:30.747 --> 01:23:33.128]  It looked like you could get out and just walk on the boats.
[01:23:33.388 --> 01:23:34.868]  I mean, there was just so many of them.
[01:23:34.948 --> 01:23:35.789]  There must have been 5,000 boats.
[01:23:38.029 --> 01:23:54.800]  But it was, it was, the water was so churned up from all the boats going, and also they said, about all these boats sinking, I saw one boat, and I spent about three hours going up and down the lake, and it was a tiny little fishing boat that had overturned.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.221]  Well how about this, how about we do it again next weekend?
[01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:59.383]  Yeah, let's do it!
[01:23:59.643 --> 01:24:01.985]  I think every Saturday we should have a Trump boating deal.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.221]  You'll go live on the boat.
[01:24:06.261 --> 01:24:08.443]  You'll go live from the helicopter.
[01:24:08.463 --> 01:24:09.684]  Can I go on the helicopter next week?
[01:24:10.325 --> 01:24:11.206]  Let's do it.
[01:24:11.766 --> 01:24:12.967]  Did you get Joe Rogan out there with you?
[01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:15.970]  No, I haven't talked to him yet.
[01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:18.552]  Alright, well, we gotta get him out.
[01:24:18.572 --> 01:24:19.453]  You know, he's a neighbor now.
[01:24:19.473 --> 01:24:21.515]  Yeah, that's what I heard.
[01:24:21.615 --> 01:24:22.376]  He's a neighbor of yours.
[01:24:22.396 --> 01:24:24.278]  We won't say where you live, but he's a neighbor of yours.
[01:24:24.338 --> 01:24:25.499]  I'm sure you know that now.
[01:24:27.108 --> 01:24:29.069]  Yeah, I've been hearing rumors about it.
[01:24:29.410 --> 01:24:30.010]  Oh yeah, I'm sure.
[01:24:30.511 --> 01:24:31.872]  Anyways, pretty exciting, man.
[01:24:32.292 --> 01:24:35.194]  What do you make of the exodus out of California and all this craziness happening?
[01:24:36.455 --> 01:24:37.116]  I didn't hear that.
[01:24:37.136 --> 01:24:39.598]  What do you make of the exodus out of California and everything?
[01:24:41.599 --> 01:24:55.550]  Well, anybody that has any brains, it seems kind of smart, but, you know, they're, I mean, Disneyland, all that, everybody that is, they're just getting tired of being taxed to death and all their money taken away and being surrounded by
[01:25:02.283 --> 01:25:06.586]  Did you hear that the left was really mad about the helicopters?
[01:25:06.626 --> 01:25:08.447]  They were really mad that Trump supporters had helicopters?
[01:25:14.813 --> 01:25:19.556]  All the stuff from the Trump pages were all supportive, but all those videos would get shared.
[01:25:19.736 --> 01:25:30.001]  And then I would read on Reddit where they were talking about reporting me to the FAA and all this other kind of stuff and saying I was dangerous and I was endangering people.
[01:25:30.021 --> 01:25:33.403]  But yeah, I got to read a bunch of that stuff.
[01:25:34.023 --> 01:25:36.325]  Well, you are the head of the helicopter mafia in Austin.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.103]  Well, I'm not the head, but I am a member.
[01:25:40.583 --> 01:25:41.925]  Was Dakota up there with you guys?
[01:25:42.887 --> 01:25:51.158]  No, Dakota is a, he works the fire department, so he was out working yesterday, so he got to miss all the fun stuff.
[01:25:51.258 --> 01:25:53.702]  I just noticed, there were like three Ravens up there, right?
[01:25:56.108 --> 01:25:58.430]  There was, I think, four of us that I knew.
[01:25:58.450 --> 01:26:05.337]  There was three Ravens, an R-66, and I also saw tons of other helicopters.
[01:26:05.377 --> 01:26:06.619]  Well, look, I'm jealous.
[01:26:06.779 --> 01:26:07.720]  I wanted to be part of it.
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:08.761]  I said months ago we should do it.
[01:26:09.101 --> 01:26:12.345]  I'm announcing we're doing another one Saturday, and I'm going to see you out there, brother.
[01:26:12.365 --> 01:26:12.645]  All right?
[01:26:12.665 --> 01:26:13.786]  I'll call you after the show.
[01:26:13.806 --> 01:26:14.387]  We love you, Shane.
[01:26:15.197 --> 01:26:16.277]  I love you too, buddy.
[01:26:37.902 --> 01:26:39.323]  You're coming up for two hours.
[01:26:39.403 --> 01:26:40.284]  It's going to be powerful.
[01:26:40.664 --> 01:26:42.145]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:26:42.185 --> 01:26:45.668]  You'll see the live feed page posted there on Infowars.
[01:26:45.708 --> 01:26:46.868]  Just share that feed.
[01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:49.430]  We're working seven days a week, even harder during all this.
[01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:50.451]  I want to thank the great crew.
[01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:51.632]  I want to thank all the listeners.
[01:26:51.672 --> 01:26:52.733]  He's taking phone calls.
[01:26:53.193 --> 01:26:55.735]  He's looking at Biden, the brainiac.
[01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:58.332]  Beyond sleepy Joe Biden.
[01:26:59.273 --> 01:27:03.099]  We're selling a new t-shirt, by the way, that's Joe Biden for Nursing Home 2020.
[01:27:03.539 --> 01:27:04.260]  I'm not kidding.
[01:27:04.281 --> 01:27:05.542]  We're only selling it for one month.
[01:27:05.943 --> 01:27:06.844]  Infowarshore.com.
[01:27:06.864 --> 01:27:07.545]  We got a big sale.
[01:27:08.875 --> 01:27:10.956]  I want to thank the listeners for all your financial support.
[01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:12.537]  Without you, we would not be here.
[01:27:12.877 --> 01:27:14.258]  But it is a beautiful time to be alive.
[01:27:14.738 --> 01:27:15.759]  Oh, and we're going to be part of it.
[01:27:15.779 --> 01:27:17.740]  It's going to be an even bigger boat event next weekend.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.141]  Biden for Nursing Home 2020.
[01:27:19.221 --> 01:27:20.742]  We've got to rent a giant boat, though.
[01:27:20.762 --> 01:27:21.482]  My boat's too little.
[01:27:22.082 --> 01:27:23.883]  I'm telling you, get a party bar.
[01:27:23.924 --> 01:27:24.724]  Get a party bar.
[01:27:24.744 --> 01:27:28.006]  A little bitty, tiny little... Final summer blowout with Alex Jones.
[01:27:28.086 --> 01:27:29.046]  All right, hey!
[01:27:29.246 --> 01:27:30.687]  Sunday Live's coming up now.
[01:27:30.767 --> 01:27:31.288]  Share those links.
[01:27:31.308 --> 01:27:32.008]  We love you all.
[01:27:32.268 --> 01:27:33.389]  Please support our local affiliates.
[01:27:40.325 --> 01:27:41.826]  Hey, you there.
[01:27:42.286 --> 01:27:44.228]  The battle for the Republic is on.
[01:27:44.648 --> 01:27:48.110]  The American Revolution 2.0 is happening right now.
[01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:53.634]  But the corrupt establishment doesn't want you to know, and they certainly don't want you to get involved.
[01:27:54.014 --> 01:27:56.696]  But you can at Banned.Video.
[01:27:56.916 --> 01:27:59.898]  The truth lives at Banned.Video.
[01:28:00.118 --> 01:28:04.541]  The information they don't want you to see is at Banned.Video.
[01:28:04.961 --> 01:28:06.102]  This is your destiny.
[01:28:06.462 --> 01:28:08.904]  This is the epic battle for the future of humanity.
[01:28:09.345 --> 01:28:12.136]  America will survive as long as you fight.
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:13.522]  I've gotta go.
[01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:40.864]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[01:28:41.445 --> 01:28:43.048]  This is taken under the tongue
[01:28:44.002 --> 01:28:45.183]  It is pure turmeric.
[01:28:46.183 --> 01:28:54.868]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[01:28:55.388 --> 01:29:03.412]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:06.694]  The two formulas are different but both are concentrates
[01:29:06.994 --> 01:29:07.354]  We're good to go.
[01:29:36.787 --> 01:29:43.113]  I talk to the EMS, I talk to the medical doctors, and what makes you nauseated is not just the smell of piss, but what we call the smell of lung piss.
[01:29:43.133 --> 01:29:44.695]  It has this sweet nauseating smell.
[01:29:44.955 --> 01:29:45.976]  It's on the face.
[01:29:45.996 --> 01:29:50.140]  All it does, it's a sweet, it's a sweet stench that makes you want to throw up like rotten meat.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.002]  It is, it is the crap of dust mites.
[01:29:52.402 --> 01:29:56.564]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist-run neighborhoods?
[01:29:56.924 --> 01:30:03.446]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing, and InfoWars Store has the solution.

[01:30:37.501 --> 01:30:48.329]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.

[01:30:51.632 --> 01:30:55.455]  Bobby in New York, a postal worker on the mail-in ballots and the NRA.
[01:30:55.495 --> 01:30:55.835]  Welcome.
[01:30:55.875 --> 01:30:56.876]  Hey, what's going on Alex?
[01:30:56.956 --> 01:30:58.897]  I'm an United States Postal Service worker.
[01:30:59.098 --> 01:31:01.319]  I listen to the show every day when I'm out walking my route.
[01:31:01.519 --> 01:31:06.183]  And we were briefed before they even had us start wearing masks in the office that we're doing mail-in ballots.
[01:31:06.323 --> 01:31:06.463]  Bingo!
[01:31:06.543 --> 01:31:11.989]  That way they've already voted not knowing that Biden is just a shoehorn to just wait for the next person they're going to put in.
[01:31:24.482 --> 01:31:24.962]  Is that credible?
[01:31:42.295 --> 01:31:47.179]  They're telling you, oh, before the masks were even being put on, we're going to have to have mail-in ballots.
[01:31:47.439 --> 01:31:50.701]  And so before the debates are even done, most people would have already voted.
[01:31:50.781 --> 01:31:52.002]  That is so sneaky.
[01:31:52.082 --> 01:31:52.923]  That is so dangerous.
[01:31:52.943 --> 01:31:58.287]  And that gives the Democrats time to rig those mail-in ballots and stuff those ballots and pull all sorts of games.
[01:31:58.367 --> 01:32:00.989]  That's their secret weapon to remove Trump and defeat America.
[01:32:01.289 --> 01:32:04.493]  But honestly, in any other election, we haven't had mail-in voting.
[01:32:04.513 --> 01:32:05.894]  So how could you tell people that?
[01:32:05.954 --> 01:32:10.439]  You can't go to the ballot, you can't give an actual vote, and this person's not the legitimate president.
[01:32:10.479 --> 01:32:17.187]  The whole four years that he's been in office, and then the moment that comes time to actually get into the ballot to vote, you can't actually go and do it.
[01:32:17.247 --> 01:32:18.648]  You gotta do it through the mail-in system.
[01:32:18.848 --> 01:32:21.271]  And who knows how legitimate that could actually be?
[01:32:21.451 --> 01:32:27.417]  Well, you know how the scam works.
[01:32:27.498 --> 01:32:29.339]  They mail these out of the homes of dead people.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:32.643]  They mail these out of the homes of people that know they're getting the ballots of dead people.
[01:32:32.743 --> 01:32:36.327]  And they mail these out to people whose cat died 10 years ago and then somebody else fills it out.
[01:32:36.527 --> 01:32:39.850]  And then when they get a lot of these ballots back, they can just falsify them however they want.
[01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:43.893]  This is the takeover, and they've already said that if Trump challenges this, he's a dictator.
[01:32:43.913 --> 01:32:49.297]  So they're already saying, we're going to steal it, and if you challenge it, you're a dictator, and we're going to arrest whoever aids you.
[01:32:49.337 --> 01:32:50.598]  That was the Washington Post headline.
[01:32:50.618 --> 01:32:53.520]  If any of his cabinet doesn't agree, we'll put you in jail too.
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:58.824]  So see, that's why they invoked this for the election, and Trump had better take action with 88 days out.
