[00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:31.362]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking developments right now as the Alex Jones Show goes live.
[00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:43.067]  The latest plan to take out President Trump will be broken down by Alex Jones in T minus five minutes.
[00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:46.709]  He's getting the final intel right now before he comes and breaks this news to you.
[00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.846]  Live here on air.
[00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:51.446]  Owen Troyer will be sitting in here.
[00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:52.967]  That's me.
[00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:56.068]  Co-hosting with Alex, who will be joining me in studio.
[00:00:56.068 --> 00:00:59.829]  We've also got Patrick Byrne lined up to join me today.
[00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.351]  Of course, he has not been so subtle.
[00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:08.312]  Talking about what he's been up to the last week or so.
[00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:15.154]  Meeting with the President in the White House, Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn, and others.
[00:01:16.223 --> 00:01:27.430]  But last night, we're going to air this clip today on the Alex Jones Show, but two important videos from President Trump.
[00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.712]  It's not the best strategy, in my opinion, how he's doing this, but he's doing it nonetheless.
[00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:38.616]  And he put out two statements last night from the White House, one addressing the voter fraud, a 10-minute speech.
[00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:39.837]  We're going to air that coming up.
[00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:49.155]  And then a five minute address on the stimulus bill that is just blatant robbery of the American people.
[00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:52.878]  I don't know how else to put it.
[00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:59.223]  It's the Republicans and the Democrats teaming up to rob us dry.
[00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:01.545]  And President Trump said he would veto that bill.
[00:02:01.545 --> 00:02:09.572]  So, a corrupt deep state made up of Republicans and Democrats are now going back to the drawing board and saying, well, wait a second.
[00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.860]  Just make it a $1 trillion stimulus bill.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.861]  Don't cut any of the aid to the foreign countries we're giving it to, but we'll give the people $2,000.
[00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:26.464]  So they shut down the entire economy for a whole year and say, here's a couple thousand bucks, American.
[00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:28.364]  Get bent.
[00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:29.945]  Oh, I mean, we love you.
[00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:32.165]  Here's some free money.
[00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:36.267]  When all they really have to do is reopen the economy and they know it.
[00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:37.667]  Let's see, they're taking orders from China.
[00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:50.765]  And they're taking orders from globalists in the corporate government that run their campaigns and fund it and fund the media.
[00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:53.106]  And so they say, no, you cannot give Trump an inch.
[00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:57.588]  But Trump is now signaling he's ready to lead from the front.
[00:02:57.588 --> 00:02:59.369]  He's been leading from behind.
[00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.810]  We were a little harsh on President Trump yesterday.
[00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.991]  He comes out and makes two important statements.
[00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.152]  Now he looks like he wants to lead from the front.
[00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:20.836]  As we turn the calendar to Christmas and the New Year, and then it's a matter of days that the President has to save the United States of America, it may come down to Mike Pence as well.
[00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:27.520]  And we're going to have a news update on that situation.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.664]  But now that Trump is signaling he's going to lead from the front, maybe the Deep State and the CHICOMS thought he was lying down.
[00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:35.545]  Maybe they really did.
[00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:40.822]  Hell, we probably maybe considered that to be a reality.
[00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:43.703]  But now he's signaling he's going to lead from the front.
[00:03:43.703 --> 00:04:01.507]  So they have to launch a new plan to stymie him and do whatever it takes to relinquish any powers that he has or harm him in the coming days before the President of the United States steps up to save the Republic.
[00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:04.848]  And when you look at the two-pronged attack against us right now,
[00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:18.198]  Whether it's the rigged presidential election that we just saw, or it's the blatant theft, the blatant theft of our money.
[00:04:18.198 --> 00:04:27.846]  You know, I got real upset yesterday about this, and just talking about it right now, I'm starting to get my blood boiling again, but I'm gonna take a deep breath and calm down.
[00:04:27.846 --> 00:04:31.509]  It's just so egregious, it's so blatant.
[00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:42.454]  And I just don't know how every American of every race, color, creed, size, shape, all of it isn't fuming mad.
[00:04:42.454 --> 00:04:53.618]  Our politicians and our media steal our elections and now they're trying to steal every last dollar you have while they shut the economy down.
[00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:55.039]  It's an attack on our country.
[00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.360]  It's time to accept it, recognize it, stand up and fight back.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:11.131]  This message is not for our regular listeners who are informed and understand about the value of essential vitamins and minerals, meaning if you don't have them, you die long term.
[00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:12.673]  It's for new listeners.
[00:05:12.673 --> 00:05:16.617]  The power structure works around the clock to try to debilitate you and try to make you sickly.
[00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:18.979]  Please research, because this is life and death.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.141]  Vitamins that are essential and minerals that are essential.
[00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:24.922]  Just type that into a search engine.
[00:05:24.922 --> 00:05:28.263]  You will see the top universities, CDC, all of them telling you this.
[00:05:28.263 --> 00:05:39.307]  But you won't see this on the nightly news because they don't want you at the big pharma companies to understand how to protect yourself to a great extent from what's going on in the world on a routine basis.
[00:05:39.987 --> 00:05:46.591]  We now have back in stock Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your body's immune system.
[00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:48.632]  Back in stock, sold out for months.
[00:05:48.632 --> 00:05:54.975]  It is essential, it is vital, and it is 50% off, so you have no excuse but to get it for yourself and your family.
[00:05:54.975 --> 00:05:58.737]  Winter Sun, back in stock, 50% off at Infowarestore.com.
[00:06:14.693 --> 00:06:19.015]  This country is doomed.
[00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:30.840]  It is doomed, not just because of African Americans, but because by 2040, this country is going to be minority white European.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.960]  Hear me?
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.561]  Minority white European.
[00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:41.144]  And you guys are going to have to start working more with Hispanics, who make up a larger portion of the population than y'all do.
[00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.933]  In terms of raw numbers.
[00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:50.176]  So, if you want to know Joe Biden's policies for America, we are doomed.
[00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:56.741]  If you ever could hire an agent to destroy your country during a crisis, they would stand up and tell everybody, we're doomed.
[00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:00.124]  That's the archetypal, we're doomed.
[00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:06.589]  In fact, foreign armies used to hire generals and pay them off, and then they would have them stand up in the middle of a battle and say, we're doomed!
[00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:08.851]  And then they would run, and they'd be paid off for doing it.
[00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:13.715]  So, we're now hearing that we are doomed from Joe Biden.
[00:07:13.715 --> 00:07:17.258]  That is his official political view for America.
[00:07:17.258 --> 00:07:18.319]  Make America great again.
[00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.600]  Keep America great.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.320]  Bring back jobs.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.743]  As soon as Trump got in, the stock market doubled because people said, oh, we're open for business again?
[00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:26.025]  We weren't under globalism.
[00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:26.766]  And so here we are.
[00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:33.551]  So the reason I'm here, supposed to take a few days off, Owen's gracious enough to try to get me to take off, is because I woke up at 3 a.m.
[00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:34.032]  I couldn't sleep.
[00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:43.616]  I already wanted to come on air and explain to the public what was happening to Trump and things I was seeing in the media that told me they were going to go 25th Amendment to try to remove him.
[00:07:43.616 --> 00:07:46.819]  And my gut and political analysis is never wrong when I go with my gut.
[00:07:47.881 --> 00:07:54.946]  And then all of a sudden at 5 a.m., Richard Reeves, my good friend, sends me a clip of Patrick Byrne, who is advising Trump for many months.
[00:07:54.946 --> 00:07:55.366]  I knew this.
[00:07:55.366 --> 00:07:56.186]  Didn't want to tell people.
[00:07:56.186 --> 00:07:56.787]  He didn't want me to.
[00:07:56.787 --> 00:08:02.190]  It was at the White House with Powell and with Flynn for four hours last week.
[00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.492]  They did discuss civil emergency.
[00:08:04.492 --> 00:08:07.994]  They did discuss the Insurrection Act because we're facing a foreign takeover.
[00:08:11.048 --> 00:08:13.190]  I also checked with other people.
[00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.772]  Trump is totally surrounded.
[00:08:14.772 --> 00:08:17.735]  Basically, he's got less than 10% of his original staff.
[00:08:17.735 --> 00:08:19.877]  The Marines are still there flying around the helicopter.
[00:08:19.877 --> 00:08:21.699]  That's about it.
[00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:25.282]  The people serving him his food love him.
[00:08:25.282 --> 00:08:26.643]  The people that know who he is like him.
[00:08:26.643 --> 00:08:31.969]  But other than that, all the lawyers, all the scum, all the trash literally yelling him to his face.
[00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:34.171]  And if he fires them, they just send more in.
[00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:37.672]  Because, imagine, he's like a brain that has nerves.
[00:08:37.672 --> 00:08:38.732]  He's a quadriplegic.
[00:08:38.732 --> 00:08:40.972]  There's no nerves below the brainstem.
[00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:42.373]  So, Trump can talk.
[00:08:42.373 --> 00:08:43.533]  That's about it.
[00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:44.653]  And boy, is he surrounded.
[00:08:44.653 --> 00:08:45.313]  Is he perfect?
[00:08:45.313 --> 00:08:45.493]  No.
[00:08:45.493 --> 00:08:46.853]  But everybody wants to desert him now.
[00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:49.554]  Looks like he's a loser and go, well, he's for red flag laws.
[00:08:49.554 --> 00:08:53.295]  No, he knew how to kill their operation by saying he was for that in the debate.
[00:08:53.295 --> 00:08:56.435]  Because if Trump was for the guns, it would make them rally against the guns.
[00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.076]  And that was his inside baseball.
[00:08:58.076 --> 00:08:59.676]  Doesn't mean I even agree with what he did.
[00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:03.665]  But it worked so far on the assault weapons ban and other things.
[00:09:03.665 --> 00:09:05.069]  But everybody copping out on Trump.
[00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:06.091]  We elected him.
[00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:07.836]  It's not about even his policies at this point.
[00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:16.435]  Is that globalists are involved in a hostile takeover with Joe Biden, who says America is doomed.
[00:09:16.435 --> 00:09:19.057]  And you see Al Sharpton and everyone nodding.
[00:09:19.057 --> 00:09:21.018]  They don't want America to even exist.
[00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:27.562]  They're globalists that have parlayed a deal to end the country and use our diversity as a weapon against us, okay?
[00:09:27.562 --> 00:09:30.444]  And they're setting blacks up as the fall guy for this.
[00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:33.305]  And we're, oh, we don't want old white people to get the shot.
[00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:34.146]  They're bad.
[00:09:34.146 --> 00:09:34.626]  They're white.
[00:09:34.626 --> 00:09:35.367]  That's mainstream news.
[00:09:36.307 --> 00:09:37.748]  Blacks, we love you, take the shot.
[00:09:37.748 --> 00:09:40.510]  Well, the good news is blacks aren't buying into that.
[00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.892]  It's not about patronizing blacks.
[00:09:41.892 --> 00:09:43.413]  I don't care what damn color your skin is.
[00:09:43.413 --> 00:09:45.995]  I care about your soul and your red blood, okay?
[00:09:45.995 --> 00:09:50.318]  And if I can get the blacks to wake up and wake up others, I can get anybody to wake up, and that's what I want to do.
[00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:52.320]  If I can get old people to wake up, I can wake up anybody.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.022]  If I can wake up white people, I can wake up anybody, okay?
[00:09:55.022 --> 00:09:59.766]  I'm here to get—if I can get leftists woken up, I can wake up anybody, anybody.
[00:10:01.786 --> 00:10:03.447]  We're doing it here, okay?
[00:10:03.447 --> 00:10:08.629]  And we're trying as hard as we can because, to me, it isn't about earthly treasures.
[00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:10.510]  It's not about being part of the New World Order.
[00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.110]  It's about my soul.
[00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.212]  And God tells me, you don't sit there and engage in this type of evil.
[00:10:16.212 --> 00:10:17.112]  You don't play God.
[00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:18.513]  Well, Bill Gates broke that rule.
[00:10:19.253 --> 00:10:20.593]  And he's running the world government now.
[00:10:20.593 --> 00:10:22.734]  They've announced he runs the G8 now.
[00:10:22.734 --> 00:10:26.755]  They had a major South American country say Bill Gates is now in control of our nation.
[00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:31.116]  Harrison Smith has a clip of that he didn't get to during American Journal this morning that I took over.
[00:10:31.116 --> 00:10:32.696]  He'll be airing it during the War Room today.
[00:10:32.696 --> 00:10:34.757]  Your normal show, Owen.
[00:10:34.757 --> 00:10:37.637]  But people are asking, okay, what's the huge news?
[00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:43.919]  I had a headline for American Journal this morning of national emergency, emergency broadcast.
[00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:44.859]  I'm paraphrasing.
[00:10:44.859 --> 00:10:47.800]  Maybe you guys can pull up the live show feed and scroll down a little bit.
[00:10:49.676 --> 00:10:53.519]  And I basically said there is an active coup against the President.
[00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.680]  They're planning on removing him by next week.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.301]  Now, people say, well, how do you know that?
[00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:02.565]  Well, I've learned when they're capos, get up on television.
[00:11:02.565 --> 00:11:08.288]  And when they say they're going to do X, Y, and Z, they do X, Y, and Z. And you've had Pelosi.
[00:11:08.288 --> 00:11:10.049]  You've had Maxine Waters.
[00:11:10.049 --> 00:11:11.390]  You've had all of them.
[00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.451]  Again, it's on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:13.592]  I can pull it up for you.
[00:11:13.592 --> 00:11:14.933]  It's a live show feed.
[00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:16.013]  Here, I'll pull it up for you.
[00:11:16.013 --> 00:11:16.714]  I'll go out there and do it.
[00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:19.478]  It's a live show feed.
[00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:20.920]  Live show feed, guys.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.262]  Alright.
[00:11:23.262 --> 00:11:24.183]  I'll pull it up.
[00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:24.663]  I'm not mad.
[00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:26.785]  I just like... Every day we do a live show feed.
[00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:27.426]  Everybody knows that.
[00:11:27.426 --> 00:11:35.774]  And if you go to the live show feed, it will show what I was saying that the show was about today when I did the show.
[00:11:35.774 --> 00:11:36.594]  But I'll find it.
[00:11:36.594 --> 00:11:37.775]  I'm not mad here.
[00:11:37.775 --> 00:11:38.236]  I'll just find it.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.421]  Okay, right there at the top, you have an overhead shot, I'll show people.
[00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:49.283]  Breaking live, Biden announces plan, America is doomed.
[00:11:49.283 --> 00:11:51.924]  Okay, he actually said that, we just showed you that.
[00:11:51.924 --> 00:11:53.784]  Now here's the sub headline from the last show.
[00:11:53.784 --> 00:11:56.065]  Okay, a little bit of a problem there.
[00:11:56.065 --> 00:11:58.346]  All right, we're gonna just keep going until we get it.
[00:11:58.346 --> 00:11:59.446]  Yeah, go ahead and scroll down, guys.
[00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:05.769]  Go ahead and scroll down, guys.
[00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:09.310]  American Journal, Trump completely surrounded deep state planning
[00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:10.712]  Yes.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:43.705]  And Arizona and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Michigan has all come out with the state legislature saying we found fraud, the forensic experts finding fraud, the OAN footage of the very fraudsters that said the water main broke and had the suitcases and kicked everybody out and did all that, they're Democratic.
[00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:48.027]  Now we've got them running the same stack over and over and over again on video.
[00:12:48.027 --> 00:12:55.009]  So now because all that's coming out, the system is completely and totally, absolutely panicked.
[00:12:55.894 --> 00:13:03.460]  And so now, they understand, and they've got Brennan and Clapper and The Nation, all of them saying, arrest four people.
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.664]  President Trump, Powell, Flynn, and Jones.
[00:13:08.664 --> 00:13:09.945]  Look it up!
[00:13:09.945 --> 00:13:13.968]  It's on CNN, it's on Atlantic Monthly, it's on The Nation, it's everywhere.
[00:13:13.968 --> 00:13:23.496]  And you saw the former CIA director call for my arrest last week, because they're involved in a criminal heist, and if they get defeated in this criminal heist, it all goes down in flames, Owen.
[00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:42.000]  Well, and I think, you know, the analogy here with Biden saying, oh, this country is doomed, it's a eugenics operation, except on nation states, where it's like, if you have terminal cancer and you're in total pain and you're in misery and you have no control over your bowels or anything, and you say, you know, some people say, hey, you know what?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.460]  Just kill me.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.661]  You know, I can't take this anymore.
[00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:44.883]  I don't want my family to see this.
[00:13:44.883 --> 00:13:46.665]  So it's all about convincing America
[00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:57.912]  You have terminal cancer, you're dead, you're in pain from our shutdown, you're dying from a disease, and all this stuff, and Biden says, see, you're doomed, so we just gotta kill ya, and we gotta bring in the CHICOMs and take care of you now.
[00:13:57.912 --> 00:13:59.312]  You died, you don't deserve to live.
[00:13:59.312 --> 00:14:03.295]  They're saying, give up, give up, give up, you're doomed, it's over.
[00:14:03.295 --> 00:14:05.696]  That's what the CHICOM, what did the Chinese say?
[00:14:05.696 --> 00:14:07.217]  Queue it up, guys, the Cruise Crate.
[00:14:07.217 --> 00:14:09.018]  Sorry I flipped out, you weren't in the headline.
[00:14:09.018 --> 00:14:10.219]  I get why they were looking for the headline.
[00:14:10.219 --> 00:14:14.982]  I said they were finding the new headline, but it was a sub-headline from earlier this morning, which they did find.
[00:14:14.982 --> 00:14:16.803]  Pull up the Chinese national media.
[00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:25.545]  Tucker aired two weeks ago, but we first aired, it's not about that, but you'll find it with Tucker, where he says, America's never reopening, America's defeated.
[00:14:25.545 --> 00:14:30.366]  The headline is, we control people in the highest circles of the United States.
[00:14:30.366 --> 00:14:38.788]  And there's the other national Chinese TV show that's an official Chinese communist saying, headline, Chinese sociologist says America is dead.
[00:14:39.548 --> 00:14:48.253]  And they say, we control COVID, they will never reopen, we control the top of their government, we control, they will never come out of their houses again and start laughing at you.
[00:14:48.253 --> 00:14:54.056]  So when you see a leftist idiot with a mask, feel sorry for him, they still think they're in America.
[00:14:54.056 --> 00:14:56.277]  They don't know they're under CHICOM-UN control.
[00:14:56.277 --> 00:14:57.178]  Well, and that's what it is.
[00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:58.859]  That's why they're laughing.
[00:14:58.859 --> 00:15:01.880]  They look at America and they say, wow, they just fell for a fake pandemic.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.921]  Wow, they just fell for a fake election.
[00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:06.682]  And now we're just telling them all of this is happening, and they don't even care.
[00:15:06.682 --> 00:15:08.043]  So let's see what else we can do.
[00:15:08.043 --> 00:15:18.308]  Let's tell them we're going to give them a COVID stimulus bill relief package, and we'll give them some Trump change, and then we'll give all these foreign nations hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:15:18.308 --> 00:15:22.310]  And that'll really be the final rape of the American people to prove that they're dead.
[00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.231]  And this is a Chi-Com operation.
[00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.432]  You called it from day one.
[00:15:25.752 --> 00:15:27.735]  Others in the media pointed this out, too.
[00:15:27.735 --> 00:15:34.946]  We're under a foreign takeover and a foreign attack, and it's time for the president to start leading from the front, and it looks like his statement last night proves that.
[00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:35.987]  And let's talk about that.
[00:15:35.987 --> 00:15:39.412]  Let's talk about that statement and play it when we come back, and play the Chi-Com statements.
[00:15:39.412 --> 00:15:41.575]  We'll go to these calls they've been holding since the last show.
[00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:44.158]  But you're absolutely right, Owen.
[00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:47.981]  We need the declaration of the Insurrection Act.
[00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:48.661]  Absolutely.
[00:15:48.661 --> 00:15:49.302]  I want it.
[00:15:49.302 --> 00:15:51.203]  I don't want Chai Khan martial law.
[00:15:51.203 --> 00:15:54.806]  I want Trump to take control of the military and rout these criminals right now.
[00:15:54.806 --> 00:15:57.408]  I want him to arrest the heads of the FBI now.
[00:15:57.408 --> 00:15:58.689]  Let's go to war!
[00:15:58.689 --> 00:16:03.213]  Introducing Infowars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.794]  This is taken under the tongue
[00:16:05.755 --> 00:16:07.937]  It is pure turmeric.
[00:16:07.937 --> 00:16:17.145]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[00:16:17.145 --> 00:16:22.990]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.152]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[00:16:25.592 --> 00:16:28.835]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:30.677]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[00:16:30.677 --> 00:16:32.798]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[00:16:32.798 --> 00:16:34.980]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.341]  Some like bodies better.
[00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:39.484]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action.
[00:16:39.484 --> 00:16:40.485]  It's so much more.
[00:16:40.485 --> 00:16:41.666]  And they fund the InfoWars.

[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.941]  Thank you for holding.
[00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:03.442]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:17:03.442 --> 00:17:04.843]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[00:17:04.843 --> 00:17:06.104]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[00:17:06.104 --> 00:17:06.824]  How are you?
[00:17:06.824 --> 00:17:07.605]  I love you, man.
[00:17:07.605 --> 00:17:09.926]  I want to make a quick plug.
[00:17:09.926 --> 00:17:11.808]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[00:17:11.808 --> 00:17:18.432]  I've been using it quite a while and I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that it contains quercetin,
[00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:31.270]  Which, according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine, and it helps channel that zinc into the cells.
[00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.252]  So, people might want to take a look at that.
[00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:52.535]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive products and it was really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this.
[00:17:52.535 --> 00:17:53.997]  So thanks, thanks for the plug.
[00:18:01.731 --> 00:18:04.350]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:21.933]  Well, I tell you, we're inside world government now.
[00:18:21.933 --> 00:18:29.038]  Owen Schroer hosts the Alex Jones Show, and the Potbelly Goblin himself is here, hobbling around, coming after you.
[00:18:29.038 --> 00:18:29.339]  Wow.
[00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:33.642]  Okay, we got loaded phone lines with everybody that's been holding in the order they've been received.
[00:18:33.642 --> 00:18:40.047]  Elton, and Mark, and Trask, and Mike, and Connell, and then Todd, Sean, Mike, and you've got...
[00:18:42.523 --> 00:18:47.627]  The big guest coming on who was in the White House meetings for four hours confirmed, I confirmed he was there.
[00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.568]  Incredible what happened, what we already know.
[00:18:49.568 --> 00:18:50.789]  Trump's totally surrounded.
[00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:53.211]  Which makes him even more powerful to now attack.
[00:18:53.211 --> 00:18:55.632]  He's saying, why shouldn't I sign the insurrection act?
[00:18:55.632 --> 00:18:57.073]  Why shouldn't I stand up?
[00:18:57.073 --> 00:19:00.296]  He's got the power, he's got to use it now.
[00:19:00.296 --> 00:19:02.237]  People say, oh, well it's martial law.
[00:19:02.237 --> 00:19:03.618]  They've already had media martial law.
[00:19:03.618 --> 00:19:04.919]  They've already had big tech martial law.
[00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:08.968]  They've already got the left burning down cities everywhere in their own leftist occupying system.
[00:19:08.968 --> 00:19:10.551]  They're threatening to release them?
[00:19:10.551 --> 00:19:12.416]  Trump will just call us out!
[00:19:12.416 --> 00:19:13.398]  But he hasn't done it yet.
[00:19:13.398 --> 00:19:14.360]  He hasn't made the decision.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.162]  I was told by the White House.
[00:19:17.185 --> 00:19:19.967]  Almost 48 hours ago, within 48 hours he would make his decisions.
[00:19:19.967 --> 00:19:22.349]  That's why we're in a real zeitgeist right now.
[00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:27.534]  And I woke up at 3 a.m., got these calls, checked all this, and confirmed what I was told is all accurate.
[00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:29.295]  What an incredible time, Owen Schreier.
[00:19:29.295 --> 00:19:44.489]  If he just, the president that is, you know, whether it's he allows a media scrum into the White House once, or he steps out onto the White House lawn and takes questions from media, if he just says, he doesn't have to sign anything yet, but if he just says, you know, I'm considering the Insurrection Act,
[00:19:45.229 --> 00:19:48.630]  All of these traders' balls would shrivel up like rays.
[00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:49.190]  Exactly.
[00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.610]  They'd all start rolling over.
[00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:51.290]  Yeah, and exactly.
[00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:55.711]  And then they'd start singing like Canaries, the ones that aren't in it so deep.
[00:19:55.711 --> 00:20:03.073]  And I think that that may be... He should host a 24-hour telethon where people march up and admit they were traitors and say they're sorry.
[00:20:03.073 --> 00:20:04.173]  And that's what I was going to say.
[00:20:04.173 --> 00:20:05.213]  Oh my God, that's what he should do.
[00:20:05.213 --> 00:20:06.034]  And that's what I was going to say.
[00:20:06.034 --> 00:20:08.114]  I mean, the videos that he put out last night are great.
[00:20:08.114 --> 00:20:09.674]  They're great statements from the Oval Office.
[00:20:09.674 --> 00:20:11.395]  Why do you take that as a signal he's going to war?
[00:20:11.395 --> 00:20:12.235]  Because that's the word I've got.
[00:20:12.475 --> 00:20:21.320]  Because he's been leading from behind for the last couple of weeks, and I understand why he does that, because he doesn't want them to just look at him and say, this is what he's doing, this is who he's doing.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:28.984]  He lets his lawyers do it, he lets people in Congress say it, and he lets, you know, certain senators and stuff, and he has people in, and Sidney Powell, and all these people.
[00:20:28.984 --> 00:20:32.806]  But then he's like, okay, eventually I have to take the lead, and I think that that's what he signaled last night.
[00:20:32.806 --> 00:20:36.789]  Now the problem is, and I don't know the measurement that the President's team does, or he does,
[00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:41.090]  Those videos are nice, they're not, they don't have the viral power.
[00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.172]  We need El Presidente at the Resolute Desk to claim more on the Chi Com.
[00:20:45.172 --> 00:21:04.198]  He needs to say, I'm doing a live statement, he can even open up the White House switchboard and take calls, and he says, I'm doing a live statement from the Oval Office, put out the date, January 5th, whatever, build that momentum, force the viral power, and then American people will see, oh look, Fox News isn't covering this live, wow, they really are dead here.
[00:21:04.198 --> 00:21:06.619]  I agree with you, but he has to start doing events every night.
[00:21:07.847 --> 00:21:17.709]  He has to do the events every night, and he needs to build them to a crescendo, and he needs to explain exactly what's happening and ask America, do you want the Insurrection Act?
[00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.610]  Do you want a redo of these states?
[00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.390]  And think about it, too.
[00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:27.892]  All he has to do is mention the Insurrection Act, and I think January 5th is the perfect night to do it, or even the 4th if you wanted to build it up a little more.
[00:21:27.892 --> 00:21:29.072]  He's due before that.
[00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:31.213]  And then he puts all the pressure on the White House.
[00:21:31.213 --> 00:21:31.833]  Oh, here's the problem.
[00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:32.573]  You're absolutely right.
[00:21:32.573 --> 00:21:33.173]  You're absolutely right.
[00:21:33.173 --> 00:21:34.594]  You're thinking 10 steps ahead, not 50 steps ahead.
[00:21:34.594 --> 00:21:35.434]  I'm not bloopering you.
[00:21:36.556 --> 00:21:38.117]  They know Trump's on the right track.
[00:21:38.117 --> 00:21:39.698]  They know the evidence of fraud's coming out.
[00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:42.420]  That's why they want to try a 25th Amendment thing now.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.582]  They're trying to organize something against him now.
[00:21:44.582 --> 00:21:46.343]  Yeah, they have to do it before January 6th.
[00:21:46.343 --> 00:21:49.726]  Yeah, he needs to start, he needs to launch operations now.
[00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:51.867]  He needs to come out tonight.
[00:21:51.867 --> 00:22:01.134]  He definitely needs to do something before January 6th, but... What do you make of these photos where he's looking at Lincoln, he's looking at Jackson, he's looking at Churchill?
[00:22:01.134 --> 00:22:03.315]  I mean, I think he's telling you, because remember, Winston Churchill
[00:22:04.176 --> 00:22:06.277]  Was a laughing stock saying Hitler was bad.
[00:22:06.277 --> 00:22:12.499]  Winston Churchill was made fun of wanting to go to war and stand up until the last minute, and that's what Trump's saying.
[00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:19.722]  Well, it's all symbolic, but I think it's time for Trump to start putting pressure on certain people like Mike Pence.
[00:22:19.722 --> 00:22:21.902]  And that's why I think January 4th or 5th would be such a thing.
[00:22:21.902 --> 00:22:25.984]  If he says Insurrection Act, all these people are going to start crapping their britches.
[00:22:25.984 --> 00:22:31.086]  But if he comes out and makes a statement before January 6th, that puts all the pressure on Mike Pence to do the right thing.
[00:22:32.626 --> 00:22:33.467]  No, I agree.
[00:22:33.467 --> 00:22:38.112]  I mean, what we need is the leadership to say, big text, he should start, my fellow Americans out here, because...
[00:22:49.335 --> 00:22:54.681]  Google, through YouTube, censored a Senate hearing on election fraud, where Evans was shown a fraud.
[00:22:54.681 --> 00:22:57.904]  Since when in America does Google censor the U.S.
[00:22:57.904 --> 00:22:58.905]  Senate?
[00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:03.170]  That's where we're going to start tonight, is with that opening statement, they censored.
[00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.233]  Now that you see what they're censoring, let me show you some more of the evidence.
[00:23:06.233 --> 00:23:09.717]  He shows it, shows it, and he says, now let me explain the Communist Chinese.
[00:23:10.017 --> 00:23:11.638]  Here are the secret documents.
[00:23:11.638 --> 00:23:12.678]  Here's who they've infiltrated.
[00:23:12.678 --> 00:23:14.099]  Here's what they've done.
[00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:15.500]  Joe Biden is their agent.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.401]  His plan is total doom, the end of America.
[00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:18.941]  Hear from him.
[00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:19.762]  Play that.
[00:23:19.762 --> 00:23:22.403]  And then just say, I have the power to stop this.
[00:23:22.403 --> 00:23:25.424]  I was elected by you, but I need to know that you support me.
[00:23:25.424 --> 00:23:26.625]  I need 10 million of you here now.
[00:23:29.306 --> 00:23:32.108]  I mean, it's here, it's waiting within our grasp.
[00:23:32.108 --> 00:23:33.308]  He must execute it.
[00:23:33.308 --> 00:23:38.231]  And you know, he's totally alone calling in Powell and Flynn, who are great people.
[00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:39.732]  One's a great lawyer, one's a great general.
[00:23:39.732 --> 00:23:41.693]  They're lightweights compared to Infowars.
[00:23:41.693 --> 00:23:43.353]  And I'm not asking to be in the White House.
[00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:45.315]  He used to get the clips from Don Jr.
[00:23:45.315 --> 00:23:46.035]  every day.
[00:23:46.035 --> 00:23:48.236]  He still seeks out Alex Jones.
[00:23:48.236 --> 00:23:49.697]  Back then, remember, like, headline.
[00:23:50.217 --> 00:23:55.498]  General Kelly's main mission is that Trump not see Jones, because he resonates with what I say.
[00:23:55.498 --> 00:23:56.759]  He sees what I say.
[00:23:56.759 --> 00:23:58.819]  If he just heard this, he would do it.
[00:23:58.819 --> 00:24:04.021]  So imagine, if we get Trump this message, whatever reason, he doesn't listen to hardly anybody.
[00:24:04.021 --> 00:24:05.301]  I'm not trying to brag here, folks.
[00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:07.501]  Trump hears me, it's like he doesn't.
[00:24:07.501 --> 00:24:09.282]  And Miller and the rest of them.
[00:24:09.562 --> 00:24:10.903]  Because I'm real, man.
[00:24:10.903 --> 00:24:14.146]  I live this 24-7 like he does, like you do.
[00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:17.188]  And so I'm just saying, it's not about Alex Jones, like, oh, aren't I big?
[00:24:17.188 --> 00:24:18.249]  No, we're in deep trouble.
[00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:20.731]  We have to get this message to him somehow.
[00:24:20.731 --> 00:24:22.632]  He didn't even know we were having a rally two weeks ago.
[00:24:22.632 --> 00:24:24.074]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[00:24:24.074 --> 00:24:29.037]  Who was it that stood in front of Congress during the impeachment hearings and said, you're the Democrats committing treason?
[00:24:29.037 --> 00:24:29.618]  That was Infowars.
[00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:34.003]  Who was it that led the first rally in D.C.
[00:24:34.003 --> 00:24:34.824]  to stop the steal?
[00:24:34.824 --> 00:24:35.986]  That was Infowars.
[00:24:35.986 --> 00:24:37.047]  So they know all that.
[00:24:37.047 --> 00:24:39.570]  They can try to siphon the energy and claim it's their movement.
[00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.851]  And we don't want the credit.
[00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:43.815]  We're saying we have the blueprints.
[00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:45.016]  We have the victory.
[00:24:45.016 --> 00:24:48.801]  All these people that go into the White House, Alex, they tell Trump what he can't do.
[00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:49.422]  They're no men.
[00:24:49.582 --> 00:24:50.623]  They say, no, you can't do that.
[00:24:50.623 --> 00:24:51.304]  No, you can't do that.
[00:24:51.304 --> 00:24:51.624]  No.
[00:24:51.624 --> 00:24:54.328]  He needs people to go in there and say, no, this is what you can do.
[00:24:54.328 --> 00:24:55.149]  This is what you must do.
[00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:55.789]  And he can!
[00:24:55.789 --> 00:25:01.576]  We have a CHICOM, big media takeover, martial law, lockdown, COVID.
[00:25:01.576 --> 00:25:06.322]  We need Trump to declare an emergency to end their emergency.
[00:25:06.322 --> 00:25:07.083]  Look at that, Alex.
[00:25:07.083 --> 00:25:07.383]  And you know,
[00:25:08.628 --> 00:25:13.490]  The energy is there, people can't go to work, they can't go to church, they can't go to school.
[00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:18.192]  I'm amazed at how many people are just at the drop of a hat, willing and ready to go to D.C.
[00:25:18.192 --> 00:25:21.553]  I mean, for conservatives and Republicans... And they're scared of the 6th.
[00:25:21.553 --> 00:25:24.334]  That's why we have to go before then.
[00:25:24.334 --> 00:25:28.336]  And I think... What I think is, I think after Christmas, if it waits that long, maybe we should go now.
[00:25:28.336 --> 00:25:31.177]  I don't care about the Christmas thing.
[00:25:31.177 --> 00:25:33.518]  If we go the day after Christmas, then we just stay in D.C.
[00:25:33.518 --> 00:25:34.318]  I think we move to D.C.
[00:25:35.728 --> 00:25:36.549]  In fact, I don't think.
[00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:37.330]  We go to D.C.
[00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.010]  now.
[00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.551]  We go to D.C.
[00:25:38.551 --> 00:25:38.711]  now.
[00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:39.292]  Keep going.
[00:25:39.292 --> 00:25:39.912]  You're going to D.C.?
[00:25:39.912 --> 00:25:41.194]  Yeah, I'm going to D.C.
[00:25:41.194 --> 00:25:41.974]  I'm not sitting around.
[00:25:41.974 --> 00:25:44.537]  I mean, let me tell you.
[00:25:44.537 --> 00:25:46.119]  They're like, Jones, you're going to prison.
[00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:47.620]  We're going to get you to do this.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.463]  We're going to put us all in prison, you damn pedophiles.
[00:25:50.463 --> 00:25:51.945]  Screw you, man.
[00:25:51.945 --> 00:25:53.446]  Screw you and your damn intimidation.
[00:25:53.446 --> 00:25:54.507]  You got the wrong guy.
[00:25:54.507 --> 00:25:57.731]  They have us in house imprisonment right now, and they're just trying to make it worse.
[00:25:58.885 --> 00:26:02.854]  But, I mean, there's 70 million plus.
[00:26:02.854 --> 00:26:08.026]  I mean, maybe all 74, 80, however many people voted for Trump, they are all... We decide!
[00:26:09.059 --> 00:26:14.963]  And I think it's hilarious that the same media that literally caused all the riots this summer that cost over $2 billion in property damage.
[00:26:14.963 --> 00:26:17.465]  I think it's funny that the media that caused those riots, they should be held responsible.
[00:26:17.465 --> 00:26:18.205]  I'm serious.
[00:26:18.205 --> 00:26:19.166]  They should be held responsible for that.
[00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:20.387]  They should be paying those damages.
[00:26:38.499 --> 00:26:40.461]  CNN, MSNBC, and the mainstream news.
[00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:44.626]  I think it's funny that they'll sit here and point the finger at us saying, how dare you go to DC?
[00:26:44.626 --> 00:26:45.727]  How dare you have rallies?
[00:26:45.727 --> 00:26:50.853]  No, how dare you instigate $2 billion worth of property damage in riots?
[00:26:50.853 --> 00:26:52.114]  To intimidate America.
[00:26:52.114 --> 00:26:53.756]  We're calling your bluff, scumbags.
[00:26:53.756 --> 00:26:54.797]  We'll be back with Call State.
[00:26:56.857 --> 00:27:10.842]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government-corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[00:27:10.842 --> 00:27:16.724]  It's all now completely official, part of the UN Great Reset of the Devos Group.
[00:27:16.724 --> 00:27:22.986]  And Klaus Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them,
[00:27:23.206 --> 00:27:25.551]  At 10 to 21, 10 to 20, 30, it's here.
[00:27:25.551 --> 00:27:30.962]  And only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper, or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[00:27:32.737 --> 00:27:39.059]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[00:27:39.059 --> 00:27:41.240]  We must start valuing human life again.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:48.142]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[00:27:48.142 --> 00:27:50.883]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[00:27:50.883 --> 00:27:54.304]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[00:27:56.735 --> 00:27:59.117]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[00:27:59.117 --> 00:28:01.899]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[00:28:01.899 --> 00:28:02.720]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.160]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:10.686]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[00:28:10.686 --> 00:28:14.308]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[00:28:14.308 --> 00:28:22.855]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[00:28:22.855 --> 00:28:26.698]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old going on 20, thanks to this.
[00:28:26.978 --> 00:28:29.099]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[00:28:29.099 --> 00:28:29.620]  We didn't know.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.181]  We didn't screen your call.
[00:28:31.181 --> 00:28:32.481]  We had no idea.
[00:28:32.481 --> 00:28:36.244]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[00:28:36.244 --> 00:28:36.764]  Living Defense.
[00:28:36.764 --> 00:28:37.284]  Living Defense.
[00:28:57.381 --> 00:28:59.782]  TheResistance.Video.

[00:29:17.089 --> 00:29:20.611]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:25.593]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[00:29:26.853 --> 00:29:27.253]  We're good.
[00:29:59.941 --> 00:30:02.550]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:14.602 --> 00:30:16.023]  By the way, the Washington D.C.
[00:30:16.023 --> 00:30:18.625]  is trying to put Owen in prison right now.
[00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:19.826]  We'll tell you about that later.
[00:30:19.826 --> 00:30:22.848]  Alright, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:22.848 --> 00:30:26.451]  I'm going to get out of here in a little while so Owen can get to his big guest next hour.
[00:30:26.451 --> 00:30:29.733]  I appreciate Elton and all these people holding.
[00:30:29.733 --> 00:30:32.195]  So, because I've made you hold and I apologize for that.
[00:30:32.195 --> 00:30:36.939]  I've done a better job on the New American Journal Show weekday mornings getting a lot of calls.
[00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:37.599]  Today we didn't.
[00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:38.199]  I apologize.
[00:30:38.199 --> 00:30:38.880]  We held you over.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.201]  You've been holding again.
[00:30:40.201 --> 00:30:42.002]  Elton in Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:30:42.002 --> 00:30:42.523]  You're on the air.
[00:30:42.523 --> 00:30:42.823]  Welcome.
[00:30:44.386 --> 00:30:52.687]  Yes, Alex, I was just wondering, you guys have seen the inauguration stage there, right?
[00:30:52.687 --> 00:30:56.668]  Yeah, Trump is building the stage, even though Biden says he'll do a virtual stage.
[00:30:56.668 --> 00:30:58.348]  So there's two ways to look at that.
[00:30:58.348 --> 00:31:06.190]  Biden doesn't want protesters, so he's going to say he's not having an inauguration, but then he shows up last minute for the imaging, which he is not below doing.
[00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.030]  He's a total decepticon.
[00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:12.211]  Or, we try to get answers, Trump is continuing because he knows he's going to win.
[00:31:12.211 --> 00:31:12.951]  What do you think is happening?
[00:31:13.973 --> 00:31:21.160]  Well, I was just making sure there was like, it wasn't any kind of gallo or something, because I haven't seen it, you know, in real life like you guys have or anything.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:31.470]  But I remember listening to you like five years ago or whatever, and they had like a three-man plastic coffin that would fit about 80 million people.
[00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.851]  Do you remember that?
[00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:35.553]  Like in Georgia or whatever?
[00:31:35.553 --> 00:31:38.155]  Yes, FEMA has stockpiles of coffins.
[00:31:38.155 --> 00:31:39.837]  All we did was ask, why do they have them?
[00:31:39.837 --> 00:31:42.439]  They went, oh, you're claiming FEMA's going to kill everybody.
[00:31:42.439 --> 00:31:45.061]  We're like, no, you've got stockpiles of coffins.
[00:31:45.061 --> 00:31:47.824]  And remember, you went to the guy that signed the bill.
[00:31:47.824 --> 00:31:48.705]  You went to his office.
[00:31:48.705 --> 00:31:50.606]  You said, hey, what's this bill about these coffins?
[00:31:50.606 --> 00:31:51.928]  And he's like, oh, I've never seen that.
[00:31:51.928 --> 00:31:54.170]  And you're like, well, here's your signature right there.
[00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.492]  He's like, oh, get out of my office.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.983]  That sounds about enough for Trump supporters or conservatives and Christians.
[00:32:01.983 --> 00:32:07.227]  I mean, there's probably more than that, but, you know... Listen, they just want to kill everybody.
[00:32:07.227 --> 00:32:10.669]  I mean, it's... The globalists want to depopulate the Earth.
[00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:11.690]  It's theirs, they believe.
[00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:12.831]  They stole it.
[00:32:12.831 --> 00:32:13.811]  They got it through fraud.
[00:32:13.811 --> 00:32:15.112]  They want us off their property.
[00:32:15.112 --> 00:32:18.435]  They want to exterminate the roaches.
[00:32:18.435 --> 00:32:22.598]  I just figured it'd be us first, and then it'd be easier to kill them next.
[00:32:24.628 --> 00:32:29.512]  I just think 2021 is going to be a bad year.
[00:32:29.512 --> 00:32:32.514]  They're already trying to condition us on the news right now anyway.
[00:32:32.514 --> 00:32:35.217]  It's a dark winter.
[00:32:35.217 --> 00:32:37.118]  It's going to be a lot worse than ever.
[00:32:37.118 --> 00:32:38.059]  But China's open.
[00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:38.760]  They're partying.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.381]  It's China shutting us down.
[00:32:40.381 --> 00:32:41.542]  That's the bottom line.
[00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:42.483]  Brings in world government.
[00:32:42.483 --> 00:32:43.623]  Brings in digital IDs.
[00:32:43.623 --> 00:32:44.324]  Brings in control.
[00:32:44.324 --> 00:32:45.185]  Thank you so much.
[00:32:45.185 --> 00:32:47.767]  And it's like anything else.
[00:32:47.767 --> 00:32:49.248]  Things just line up in time.
[00:32:49.248 --> 00:32:53.872]  Whether it's Saturn and Jupiter lining up in space or just opportunities lining up.
[00:32:55.089 --> 00:32:56.390]  It's a race.
[00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:01.913]  Either we arrest the criminals that have occupied our country, and maybe other places around the world.
[00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:03.034]  And notice how God works.
[00:33:03.034 --> 00:33:08.117]  He's given us a person who will do it, in this time, and it's like the light's disappearing.
[00:33:08.117 --> 00:33:08.898]  He's got to fire.
[00:33:08.898 --> 00:33:09.438]  He's got to do it.
[00:33:09.438 --> 00:33:10.479]  He's got to do it.
[00:33:10.479 --> 00:33:23.287]  And it's a race against time, because if we don't arrest the criminals, and I would include Biden in that, and all of Obama's administration, which I mean, it may be far-fetched, but it's either they get arrested or prosecuted, or Trump gets arrested and, you know, everything falls apart.
[00:33:23.287 --> 00:33:24.308]  Because we're going into total judgment.
[00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:24.848]  That's it.
[00:33:24.848 --> 00:33:25.909]  You're going into total judgment.
[00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:27.350]  Let's take another call.
[00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.531]  Thank you, Elton.
[00:33:28.531 --> 00:33:30.031]  Let's talk to Mark in Ohio.
[00:33:30.031 --> 00:33:30.652]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:33:30.652 --> 00:33:33.394]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:33:33.394 --> 00:33:35.635]  Welcome, sir.
[00:33:35.635 --> 00:33:40.418]  Hey, I'm 64 years old and I'm the lead general in Father God's army on Earth.
[00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.691]  And this is not a beta test.
[00:33:42.691 --> 00:33:46.253]  This is the Second Coming, and Satan is on his way.
[00:33:46.253 --> 00:33:57.959]  And it's not China, it's Satan and his army, the Deep State, who are the rich, elite banker Jews that own the earth and govern the earth, are doing their final play.
[00:33:57.959 --> 00:34:04.202]  In Scripture, there are seven nations that do not join the Antichrist army.
[00:34:04.202 --> 00:34:05.783]  And this is what it's all about.
[00:34:05.783 --> 00:34:08.765]  The USA is, I mean, we're out of time.
[00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:18.751]  The only thing that has to be done, and I hope me and you can do it, Alex, is we've got to get through to Trump and he has to declare martial law.
[00:34:18.751 --> 00:34:29.155]  He has to arrest Obama and Lynch and Clinton and Clapper and the whole 1,000 Comeys and all of them and declare martial law.
[00:34:29.155 --> 00:34:30.815]  Let me just say this.
[00:34:30.815 --> 00:34:34.256]  I don't try to get into religious groups or ethnic groups, but I'll tell you this.
[00:34:34.256 --> 00:34:34.917]  You're right.
[00:34:34.917 --> 00:34:35.757]  It's not China.
[00:34:35.757 --> 00:34:36.737]  It's Satan.
[00:34:36.737 --> 00:34:37.818]  But what does the Bible say?
[00:34:37.818 --> 00:34:38.778]  Satan is the dragon.
[00:34:39.378 --> 00:34:44.582]  And so, I don't blame the Chinese people, but the dragon is the muscle that the whore of Babylon rides on.
[00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:49.526]  China is the beast, the system, and then the whore rides upon him.
[00:34:49.526 --> 00:34:53.369]  And then you've also got this new devil pope giving all his power under the beast.
[00:34:53.369 --> 00:34:54.310]  It's all being fulfilled.
[00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.232]  I agree with you that I thought Revelation would be out further.
[00:34:57.232 --> 00:34:59.394]  It looks like they're going ahead and bringing it in.
[00:34:59.394 --> 00:35:00.275]  Thanks for the call, Owen.
[00:35:00.495 --> 00:35:02.637]  Well, this is, I mean, we're just talking geopolitics.
[00:35:02.637 --> 00:35:07.583]  And by the way, the Pope is said to be stepping down before the end of the year.
[00:35:07.583 --> 00:35:10.085]  But, you know, I was listening to that caller and something struck me.
[00:35:10.085 --> 00:35:17.513]  I don't even know what he said that did it, but I'm beginning to think that the whole reason why they're doing this with multiple rounds of the COVID vaccine
[00:35:18.254 --> 00:35:36.865]  Is because the way that Trump tried to take it over with Operation Warp Speed and promoting the vaccines and everything, it sent them into this weird panic mode where they can't roll out the real bioweapon in the vaccine until Trump gets out of office, but they still had to go with it, they still had the hundreds of billions of dollars from Trump, they still had to act like they wanted it.
[00:35:36.865 --> 00:35:40.407]  I thought that this morning, because they're like, oh, now there's a new mutation, a new vaccine's needed.
[00:35:42.248 --> 00:35:44.529]  Exactly, they give us a different vaccine and the real one comes out.
[00:35:44.529 --> 00:35:53.572]  So then it's like, oh, now it's the second wave, and that's the one where then you'll see every nurse that gets it, oh, fainting and going into, you know, shock.
[00:35:53.572 --> 00:35:54.352]  That's the thing, seizing up.
[00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:55.813]  They finally have to attack you.
[00:35:55.813 --> 00:35:57.954]  It's like, this is it.
[00:35:57.954 --> 00:35:58.294]  This is it.
[00:35:58.294 --> 00:36:00.135]  All right, let's see another call in here.
[00:36:00.135 --> 00:36:01.515]  Trask in Dallas.
[00:36:01.515 --> 00:36:03.016]  Trask, you're on the air.
[00:36:03.016 --> 00:36:04.916]  Thank you.
[00:36:04.916 --> 00:36:05.717]  Hello.
[00:36:05.717 --> 00:36:06.177]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:36:06.177 --> 00:36:09.558]  So I had a message for Trump.
[00:36:11.201 --> 00:36:19.187]  Man needs to just do the Insurrection Act and be damned with how it looks.
[00:36:19.187 --> 00:36:33.597]  We're fighting for the Republic and, you know, if the news wants to keep on putting out propaganda, we need to send the military in there and take it over.
[00:36:33.597 --> 00:36:35.139]  I agree with you a trillion percent.
[00:36:35.139 --> 00:36:38.301]  If I was in front of President Trump right now, I'd say, Mr. President,
[00:36:39.622 --> 00:36:40.923]  You didn't start the martial law.
[00:36:40.923 --> 00:36:42.443]  You didn't put us under the UN martial law.
[00:36:42.443 --> 00:36:44.304]  You didn't explain that you've been hoodwinked.
[00:36:44.304 --> 00:36:45.144]  It's been a scam.
[00:36:45.144 --> 00:36:49.266]  Tell the American people and explain that I'm not here to overthrow the Constitution.
[00:36:49.266 --> 00:36:50.506]  I'm here to defend it.
[00:36:50.506 --> 00:36:53.467]  And we're marching in and we're having new elections.
[00:36:53.467 --> 00:36:56.509]  There would be celebrations in the streets everywhere.
[00:36:56.509 --> 00:36:58.149]  Oh my God.
[00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.450]  People would be on their knees.
[00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.951]  It's not like martial law where you can't go outside your house.
[00:37:03.294 --> 00:37:06.097]  It's not like martial law where you don't have a life.
[00:37:06.097 --> 00:37:09.301]  It's martial law to stop their martial law.
[00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:15.187]  And I think, too, the public perception of the media is zero.
[00:37:15.187 --> 00:37:16.949]  The public perception of Congress is zero.
[00:37:16.949 --> 00:37:19.111]  And Trump could have a twist of fate, you know?
[00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:22.395]  I mean, I'm not sitting here like a Q person saying, oh, this was all planned out.
[00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:39.147]  I mean, you look at Gina Haspel, you look at Bill Barr, you look at Chris Wray, I mean, they're just as implicated in the Obama administration crimes as the Obama administration itself, specifically Gina Haspel, and then Barr going back into the Bush years.
[00:37:39.147 --> 00:37:46.692]  So, I mean, imagine if Trump actually went after the Republicans first, and his own people first, saying, okay, here's the crime.
[00:37:46.692 --> 00:37:47.793]  What would the Democrats do?
[00:37:47.793 --> 00:37:48.994]  Let's be clear.
[00:37:48.994 --> 00:37:52.597]  No one's ever called the deep state's bluff that hijacked America, had America's power.
[00:37:53.217 --> 00:37:56.058]  And so there are all these inbred weird pedophiles and people.
[00:37:56.058 --> 00:37:56.899]  No one ever called it.
[00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:58.980]  As soon as the dominoes start falling, it's over.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.340]  By the way, I'm not ignoring the caller.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.202]  My wireless headset just went out because the battery went bad or whatever.
[00:38:04.202 --> 00:38:05.263]  It just cut out.
[00:38:05.263 --> 00:38:07.064]  So let him finish his point.
[00:38:07.064 --> 00:38:07.744]  I'll get a new headset.
[00:38:07.744 --> 00:38:09.965]  We'll come back and take calls next segment.
[00:38:09.965 --> 00:38:10.885]  Go ahead, Trash.
[00:38:10.885 --> 00:38:12.666]  Finish your point.
[00:38:12.666 --> 00:38:13.347]  All right.
[00:38:13.347 --> 00:38:22.431]  So another thing that a good idea would be is to protect ourselves from these vaccines being mandated by companies.
[00:38:23.166 --> 00:38:36.657]  We need to get into the states and write a bill that says these companies cannot deny a service for medical apparatus or medical procedures.
[00:38:36.657 --> 00:38:40.120]  That's already actually written in via the HIPAA laws.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.421]  I mean, you can't deny somebody service like that anyway.
[00:38:42.421 --> 00:38:46.585]  So that's another angle where if they did make a claim like that, that's totally illegal.
[00:38:46.585 --> 00:38:48.086]  I mean, that's medical tyranny.
[00:38:48.086 --> 00:38:49.647]  Oh, you have to take this vaccine to get a shot.
[00:38:49.647 --> 00:38:50.468]  That's bullcrap.
[00:38:50.968 --> 00:38:55.691]  In the HIPAA, somebody shows up and their leg's dangling off and they're bleeding out, they have to receive care.
[00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:57.632]  So, I mean, that would be another level.
[00:38:57.632 --> 00:39:02.436]  Oh, and that's what I'm saying about all of this, is it's a revolution against our checks and balances and our laws.
[00:39:02.436 --> 00:39:05.017]  All this is illegal.
[00:39:05.017 --> 00:39:06.658]  They skipped the animal trials.
[00:39:06.658 --> 00:39:08.520]  They skipped everything and now it's causing problems.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:14.484]  Well, Trask was just saying that we need, Trump needs to sign a bill that says, oh, you can't be rejected any sort of care or business.
[00:39:14.484 --> 00:39:16.045]  No, no, but the law already says that.
[00:39:16.045 --> 00:39:16.565]  I know, I know.
[00:39:16.565 --> 00:39:18.426]  I'm just saying he should double down on it.
[00:39:18.426 --> 00:39:19.587]  That's Trask is saying he should.
[00:39:19.687 --> 00:39:20.447]  No, Trask is right.
[00:39:20.447 --> 00:39:22.188]  Alright, we appreciate you, brother.
[00:39:22.188 --> 00:39:23.529]  Alright, I got a new headset on.
[00:39:23.529 --> 00:39:24.270]  I'm good.
[00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:25.851]  Let's come back, jam in some more calls.
[00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:37.758]  And Owen, you've got the guy who's the center of the news, Patrick Burron, who was there at the White House meeting for four hours with the President.
[00:39:37.758 --> 00:39:38.518]  Will it really happen?
[00:39:38.518 --> 00:39:39.919]  I've confirmed from sources that were there.
[00:39:41.434 --> 00:39:42.495]  It indeed happened.
[00:39:42.495 --> 00:39:45.637]  And now we've got Georgia and other states saying we've certified fraud.
[00:39:45.637 --> 00:39:46.418]  None of it's on the news.
[00:39:46.418 --> 00:39:49.640]  We have Congress being censored right now, trying to report on all this.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.762]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:39:55.816 --> 00:40:03.182]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[00:40:03.182 --> 00:40:04.623]  We've got two different big sales.
[00:40:04.623 --> 00:40:11.869]  We've got Super Bowl Vitality, Turbo Force, and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[00:40:11.869 --> 00:40:17.334]  We've got Bodies, Vazo Beats, and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack, at 40% off.
[00:40:17.334 --> 00:40:24.880]  But if you get both of these packs together, they are 60% off with free shipping and double Patriot Points.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.400]  The best deal ever.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.862]  I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you to go to InfoWarsTore.com today and take advantage of this.
[00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:34.603]  And you can't lose because it funds the InfoWar.
[00:40:34.603 --> 00:40:42.045]  Again, get the great products at InfoWarsTore.com and fund the Second American Revolution worldwide at a time that it's more critical than ever.
[00:40:42.045 --> 00:40:48.567]  Again, the year 2021 is here and I am committed to you to fight against the globalists harder than ever.
[00:40:48.567 --> 00:40:51.367]  So thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight.
[00:40:51.367 --> 00:40:53.008]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[00:40:55.854 --> 00:40:59.955]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[00:40:59.955 --> 00:41:02.315]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[00:41:02.315 --> 00:41:09.956]  Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out force, for a political or financial reason.
[00:41:09.956 --> 00:41:13.857]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[00:41:13.857 --> 00:41:17.318]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[00:41:17.318 --> 00:41:19.758]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[00:41:19.758 --> 00:41:22.139]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:23.959]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine.
[00:41:24.719 --> 00:41:30.984]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[00:41:30.984 --> 00:41:31.905]  Okay?
[00:41:31.905 --> 00:41:36.489]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[00:41:36.489 --> 00:41:38.791]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[00:41:38.791 --> 00:41:39.612]  These are real numbers.
[00:41:39.612 --> 00:41:40.873]  These are real facts.
[00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:48.279]  This is the chicken little event where we all run in our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential, while the big box stores and Amazon take over the planet.
[00:41:48.759 --> 00:41:49.539]  Rebuke it.
[00:41:49.539 --> 00:41:50.720]  Stand up against it.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.480]  This is slavery.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.042]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[00:41:57.042 --> 00:42:00.103]  Winter Sun has been sold out for months.
[00:42:00.103 --> 00:42:01.163]  It's now back in stock.
[00:42:01.163 --> 00:42:04.664]  It's the highest quality vitamin D3 you're going to find anywhere.
[00:42:04.664 --> 00:42:09.966]  You take it out of the tongue for maximum absorption or just put it in your mouth and drink it down.
[00:42:09.966 --> 00:42:15.288]  It's absolutely an essential vitamin, meaning if you don't have it and you have a deficiency from it, you will die.
[00:42:15.868 --> 00:42:17.329]  The system doesn't want you to know this.
[00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:24.672]  And they don't want you to know that they've lowered the allowance of what they claim you need every day to a level that makes you very, very sickly and easy to control.
[00:42:24.672 --> 00:42:28.954]  But now we have Winter Sun with vitamin D3 and vitamin K that helps it upload better.

[00:43:39.369 --> 00:43:40.230]  It's groundbreaking.
[00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.331]  It's been sold out for months.
[00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:42.892]  Back in Stock, Natural Defense,
[00:43:43.012 --> 00:43:43.973]  Bullet in my shoulder.
[00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:16.642]  Blood running down my vest.
[00:44:16.642 --> 00:44:26.565]  Twenty in the posse, and they're never gonna let me rest.
[00:44:26.565 --> 00:44:31.606]  Till I became a wanted man, I never even owned a gun.
[00:44:31.606 --> 00:44:38.528]  But now they hunt me like a mountain cat, and I'm always, always,
[00:44:40.965 --> 00:44:51.330]  The Globalists want to run everything, they want to control everything, but they can't.
[00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:56.492]  Owen Schroer is hosting, I'm Alex Jones, I'm about to get out of here.
[00:44:56.492 --> 00:45:01.815]  Because I got a lot of stuff to take care of, and my vacations are work-cations.
[00:45:01.815 --> 00:45:04.236]  We got a lot of callers to get to, but I just wanted to say this.
[00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:09.293]  I'm not bitching, I'm not complaining, because I love it.
[00:45:09.293 --> 00:45:10.033]  It's bittersweet.
[00:45:10.033 --> 00:45:20.439]  We've got, I'd say three to five times, depending on the website, we've got about five times really, about four and a half times, the viewers and listeners we had a year ago.
[00:45:20.439 --> 00:45:30.204]  So when it comes to reaching people, we are in high cotton, we're kicking some ass, we're like knocking grand slams here at the baseball field.
[00:45:30.204 --> 00:45:35.807]  When it comes to money, less money this month, we brought in last year in December, and I'm spending money like it's going out of style.
[00:45:36.943 --> 00:45:39.505]  It's kind of fun, because I don't like worrying about it.
[00:45:39.505 --> 00:45:41.026]  I finally just said, screw it.
[00:45:41.026 --> 00:45:43.268]  I'll just spend my own everything and just fight as hard as I can.
[00:45:43.268 --> 00:45:44.910]  And I just hope you're going to support us.
[00:45:45.882 --> 00:45:49.304]  We had a caller from Lithuania said his bank doesn't let him buy from us now.
[00:45:49.304 --> 00:45:51.045]  And I'm sure that's what it is.
[00:45:51.045 --> 00:45:52.366]  It's all that digital crap.
[00:45:52.366 --> 00:45:55.307]  It's all the, it's all the big brother stuff going on.

[00:46:40.218 --> 00:46:42.299]  Winter Sun back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.747]  Okay, let's talk to Mike in Florida.
[00:46:44.747 --> 00:46:45.892]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[00:46:45.892 --> 00:46:46.996]  You're on the air with Owen Stroyer.
[00:46:46.996 --> 00:46:47.278]  Go ahead.
[00:46:50.578 --> 00:46:51.658]  I want to just say this.
[00:46:51.658 --> 00:46:55.019]  We're all patriots and this has to happen.
[00:46:55.019 --> 00:46:58.040]  First of all, we have to have the 10 million people.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.360]  Indiana had it right.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.960]  They got to be there, but we can't wait until the 6th.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.621]  It has to start today.
[00:47:03.621 --> 00:47:09.082]  You need to say at the beginning of each segment, at the end of each segment, calling on all patriots.
[00:47:09.082 --> 00:47:10.682]  We need to inhabit D.C.
[00:47:10.682 --> 00:47:11.503]  and do what he said.
[00:47:11.503 --> 00:47:13.463]  7 million around the White House.
[00:47:13.983 --> 00:47:16.585]  A couple million around the Capitol.
[00:47:16.585 --> 00:47:19.748]  A million around the damn Supreme Court.
[00:47:19.748 --> 00:47:20.949]  But he can't wait.
[00:47:20.949 --> 00:47:22.450]  He cannot wait.
[00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:24.051]  It is time, man.
[00:47:24.051 --> 00:47:25.032]  It is time.
[00:47:25.032 --> 00:47:27.114]  And is the military with him?
[00:47:27.114 --> 00:47:30.957]  If the military's not, we gotta be the military.
[00:47:30.957 --> 00:47:32.018]  It is time, dude.
[00:47:33.197 --> 00:47:48.790]  You know, speaking of the military real quick, there was an interesting clip, I have the story here somewhere, where somebody thanked Mike Pence, I can't find this in my stack of news, saying, thank you Mike Pence, we just had the greatest
[00:47:49.491 --> 00:47:50.792]  Here it is right here.
[00:47:50.792 --> 00:47:58.615]  Acting Secretary of the Department of Defense Chris Miller thanks Vice President Pence for effort in most complex military operation in history.
[00:47:58.615 --> 00:48:00.656]  No details or context was given.
[00:48:00.656 --> 00:48:04.698]  That was just a statement that he made thanking the Vice President for that.
[00:48:04.698 --> 00:48:07.219]  So I mean, I believe the military is on Trump's side.
[00:48:07.219 --> 00:48:09.080]  You're going to have top generals and stuff that have been turned over.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.661]  And by the way, I don't want to fetishize the military.
[00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:12.061]  They follow orders from politicians.
[00:48:12.061 --> 00:48:14.102]  But we're literally at the end of the country.
[00:48:14.102 --> 00:48:15.843]  I mean, I don't have words.
[00:48:15.843 --> 00:48:17.264]  I can't hype it up big enough.
[00:48:18.084 --> 00:48:22.888]  And it's not like the country's being taken over by the Romans, and we're the British, and they've got more advanced technology.
[00:48:22.888 --> 00:48:27.211]  So, okay, we're going to have, you know, massages now.
[00:48:27.211 --> 00:48:30.373]  This is pedophile devil worshippers are taking over.
[00:48:30.373 --> 00:48:31.434]  I mean, this is not good.
[00:48:31.434 --> 00:48:33.876]  Yeah, slave factories in China.
[00:48:33.876 --> 00:48:35.117]  Yeah.
[00:48:35.117 --> 00:48:36.058]  I mean, no value.
[00:48:36.058 --> 00:48:39.980]  Big Tech runs slave factories in China, which shows what they'll do to us.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:40.661]  God Almighty.
[00:48:40.661 --> 00:48:41.241]  Mike, anything else?
[00:48:42.358 --> 00:48:44.859]  Yeah, let's get the people there.
[00:48:44.859 --> 00:48:46.859]  Everybody, put Christmas off.
[00:48:46.859 --> 00:48:48.260]  This is more important.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.720]  No, I totally agree with you.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.441]  And so just to mobilize, it'll take me a few days.
[00:48:52.441 --> 00:48:53.701]  I think we should still have Christmas.
[00:48:53.701 --> 00:48:55.442]  I think Trump can hang on until then.
[00:48:55.442 --> 00:48:57.102]  They are playing for the Fifth Amendment.
[00:48:57.102 --> 00:48:59.663]  I believe we should surround the White House peacefully.
[00:48:59.663 --> 00:49:02.224]  That's why they have Black Lives Matter there and Antifa to surround it.
[00:49:02.224 --> 00:49:02.944]  So we can't be there.
[00:49:02.944 --> 00:49:03.804]  We're going to be there.
[00:49:03.804 --> 00:49:05.805]  We surround it.
[00:49:05.805 --> 00:49:06.485]  And then we also
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.682]  I mean, I'm going to be there.
[00:49:08.682 --> 00:49:12.568]  I'm going to be there just encamped at the White House within a few days.
[00:49:19.295 --> 00:49:22.137]  They dressed up as Native Americans.
[00:49:22.137 --> 00:49:28.960]  And in a way, it's almost like we kind of have to reenact that by, because they won't let us anywhere, but, oh, we'll be Black Lives Matter.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.941]  Oh, we have a Black Lives Matter flag and shirt.
[00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:33.703]  And then they'll just, oh, oh, okay, here, walk around the White House.
[00:49:33.703 --> 00:49:34.964]  Here, walk into the park.
[00:49:34.964 --> 00:49:35.584]  I'm not even kidding.
[00:49:35.584 --> 00:49:36.404]  I mean, that's almost like.
[00:49:36.404 --> 00:49:37.345]  The boys will bat us.
[00:49:37.345 --> 00:49:38.846]  Yeah, because I mean, you show up.
[00:49:39.466 --> 00:49:44.709]  With a Trump flag, or an American flag, and you're a patriot, oh, you'll get shut down, you'll get arrested, you're not allowed to mobilize.
[00:49:44.709 --> 00:49:51.412]  But, oh, if your Black Lives Matter, you can own the streets, you can burn buildings, burn churches, go around the White House.
[00:49:51.412 --> 00:50:00.878]  So, I mean, we kind of have to do that where we put on the Indian garb, like the Boston Tea Party, except we pretend we're Black Lives Matter, and then we take over D.C., and then you take the Trump flag out of your pocket.
[00:50:00.878 --> 00:50:01.918]  That's an interesting idea.
[00:50:01.918 --> 00:50:06.741]  Really, they were using it as a disguise, and saying, we are Native, we will beat you.
[00:50:07.441 --> 00:50:08.681]  They just won the French-Indian War.
[00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:10.822]  They were saying, we're savages.
[00:50:10.822 --> 00:50:12.382]  Which was a positive thing.
[00:50:12.382 --> 00:50:15.083]  It's just finding ways to get around.
[00:50:15.083 --> 00:50:21.664]  I mean, there's loopholes in the ridiculous... We're savages, and we're tired of all you lawyers running our lives.
[00:50:21.664 --> 00:50:23.244]  And I just, I mean, we've seen it.
[00:50:23.244 --> 00:50:26.585]  Whether it's our events, whether it's what happened in Oregon the other day, whatever.
[00:50:26.585 --> 00:50:28.286]  We're not allowed to activate.
[00:50:28.286 --> 00:50:30.386]  We're not allowed to have any penetration.
[00:50:30.386 --> 00:50:32.887]  But if you're the left... And it's not even the left.
[00:50:32.887 --> 00:50:34.607]  If you're a communist, if you're a child molester.
[00:50:34.707 --> 00:50:36.268]  I was thinking about this last night, Alex.
[00:50:36.268 --> 00:50:39.992]  I need to practice this.
[00:50:39.992 --> 00:50:42.374]  It's not even left or right, Democrat or Republican.
[00:50:42.374 --> 00:50:43.755]  It's Soros.
[00:50:43.755 --> 00:50:44.456]  Soros.
[00:50:44.456 --> 00:50:45.437]  It's Soros groups.
[00:50:45.437 --> 00:50:45.857]  It's not Democrats.
[00:50:45.857 --> 00:50:46.218]  It's not leftists.
[00:50:46.218 --> 00:50:50.942]  The average liberal, why are you promoting war and torture and Assange in jail?
[00:50:50.942 --> 00:50:51.723]  Shame on you.
[00:50:51.723 --> 00:50:52.604]  Join us.
[00:50:52.604 --> 00:50:54.526]  We're populist, you dumbasses.
[00:50:54.526 --> 00:50:55.567]  It's not Democrats.
[00:50:56.367 --> 00:50:58.048]  It's populist versus globalist.
[00:50:58.048 --> 00:50:59.088]  It's Soros groups.
[00:50:59.088 --> 00:51:01.610]  So Soros groups are allowed to go into state buildings.
[00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:04.271]  Soros groups are allowed to shut down autonomous zones.
[00:51:04.271 --> 00:51:06.052]  Soros groups are allowed to riot.
[00:51:06.052 --> 00:51:08.433]  But you, an American patriot, have no rights.
[00:51:08.433 --> 00:51:12.915]  So just pretend you're a Soros organizer and activist, and then the whole world opens up for you.
[00:51:12.915 --> 00:51:16.157]  And then once you get to the point you need to be at, that's when you take out the Trump flag.
[00:51:16.157 --> 00:51:17.698]  That's when you put on the Trump hat.
[00:51:17.698 --> 00:51:21.099]  That's when you, oh, and then see, oh, then the police will probably move in on you.
[00:51:21.099 --> 00:51:22.060]  But it'll be too late then.
[00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:24.311]  Holy Toledo.
[00:51:24.311 --> 00:51:25.351]  See, this is what you get to do.
[00:51:25.351 --> 00:51:26.512]  So I'm telling you... Canela!
[00:51:26.512 --> 00:51:32.034]  Canela in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:51:32.034 --> 00:51:33.175]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:51:33.175 --> 00:51:37.197]  Oh man, I'm just... I'm watching the Battle of the Gods here, brother.
[00:51:37.197 --> 00:51:38.117]  Oh, I feel you, man.
[00:51:38.117 --> 00:51:44.501]  You know, for the... I want to talk in particularly to my age group, that's, you know, in the 20s and 30s, uh, year olds.
[00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:51.084]  Um, I've spent the last 10 years in the music industry, traveling around Central, South, and North America, and, uh,
[00:51:52.785 --> 00:52:01.173]  I've always told the truth about what was going on, but I was on the fence about it in the sense that I didn't tell it right to their face.
[00:52:01.173 --> 00:52:05.056]  You know, I kind of said what it had to say to get by in that industry.
[00:52:05.056 --> 00:52:08.259]  Well, the time for that is over.
[00:52:08.259 --> 00:52:14.225]  And everybody, everybody in my generation, everybody in the generation before me, we all
[00:52:14.853 --> 00:52:16.414]  Need to stand up now.
[00:52:16.414 --> 00:52:19.596]  Because there is no other choice outside of that, you know?
[00:52:19.596 --> 00:52:20.817]  Don't you feel that calling?
[00:52:20.817 --> 00:52:22.278]  Like, I'm ready to die right now.
[00:52:22.278 --> 00:52:23.979]  Well, there's no more time for denial, either.
[00:52:23.979 --> 00:52:25.880]  People have been denying how drastic it is.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.301]  People have been denying how bad it is.
[00:52:27.301 --> 00:52:30.503]  People have been denying, oh no, I still live in America, I'm still free.
[00:52:30.503 --> 00:52:31.704]  Well, take a look around.
[00:52:31.704 --> 00:52:34.646]  So, I mean, it's time to stop living in denial.
[00:52:34.646 --> 00:52:41.690]  Yeah, you know, and another interesting thing, you know, I was looking into these cycles of tyranny and violence throughout history.
[00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.172]  Kind of like you guys were talking about this morning in the American Journal.
[00:52:45.243 --> 00:52:58.969]  And, uh, I noticed that it's coinciding at this point in history with the natural cycles that the sun's going through, and that the Earth itself is in turmoil, and there hasn't really been an experience like that yet.
[00:52:58.969 --> 00:53:04.011]  So, this is a multifaceted battle, and it starts in the spiritual realm.
[00:53:04.011 --> 00:53:10.334]  No, I agree, but don't they get that, like, I can feel it, like, they're not gonna be able to stop what's about to happen, like, it's like, bleh.
[00:53:10.334 --> 00:53:12.515]  I mean, you're not gonna stop this now.
[00:53:13.948 --> 00:53:22.236]  Yeah, and another thing for the people who are calling for Trump to strike now, I just want to put this out there.
[00:53:22.236 --> 00:53:32.447]  You know, we're watching a massive sword battle right now, a one-on-one, Trump and this giant snake of a deep state, and we're watching it from 50 yards, and it might look
[00:53:33.351 --> 00:53:36.752]  Pretty bad right now, but just know, that's not Trump's game.
[00:53:36.752 --> 00:53:43.053]  And he's going to wait until that snake sticks its head out of the hole, and he's going to give a decisive blow.
[00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:44.153]  No, I hear you brother.
[00:53:44.153 --> 00:53:47.254]  I'm not disagreeing with you and I appreciate your call, but I know all the lawyers.
[00:53:47.254 --> 00:53:47.834]  I know Trump.
[00:53:47.834 --> 00:53:48.674]  I talked to him.
[00:53:48.674 --> 00:53:49.754]  He is surrounded.
[00:53:49.754 --> 00:53:51.335]  That's not a negative thing.
[00:53:51.335 --> 00:53:51.755]  He needs us.
[00:53:51.755 --> 00:53:53.535]  You understand that?
[00:53:53.535 --> 00:53:54.595]  Yes, he has the ideas.
[00:53:54.595 --> 00:53:56.016]  Yes, he wanted a landslide.
[00:53:56.016 --> 00:53:58.816]  Yes, he's a great guy.
[00:53:58.816 --> 00:54:01.757]  He is surrounded by scum and cowards.
[00:54:02.796 --> 00:54:04.177]  That's what I'm telling you.
[00:54:04.177 --> 00:54:10.661]  He is surrounded by lawyers that are the filth of the planet that would sell their mother out for a stick of bubblegum.
[00:54:10.661 --> 00:54:12.722]  And so he needs everybody to go to D.C.
[00:54:12.722 --> 00:54:12.902]  now.
[00:54:12.902 --> 00:54:15.184]  We need just people to start going to D.C.
[00:54:15.184 --> 00:54:15.764]  now.
[00:54:15.764 --> 00:54:16.365]  Don't wait.
[00:54:16.365 --> 00:54:17.025]  Go to D.C.
[00:54:17.025 --> 00:54:17.685]  Go to D.C.
[00:54:17.685 --> 00:54:18.526]  Go to D.C.
[00:54:18.526 --> 00:54:19.767]  Go to the White House.
[00:54:19.767 --> 00:54:21.228]  Just go to the White House!
[00:54:21.228 --> 00:54:21.488]  Go!
[00:54:21.488 --> 00:54:21.548]  Go!
[00:54:21.548 --> 00:54:21.968]  Go!
[00:54:21.968 --> 00:54:22.228]  Go!
[00:54:22.228 --> 00:54:22.288]  Go!
[00:54:22.288 --> 00:54:22.729]  Go!
[00:54:22.729 --> 00:54:22.949]  Go!
[00:54:28.487 --> 00:54:30.548]  Alright, Owen Troyer's gonna take over.
[00:54:30.548 --> 00:54:32.269]  He's got a few more calls.
[00:54:32.269 --> 00:54:33.649]  And then he's got this big guest coming on.
[00:54:33.649 --> 00:54:35.610]  He was in that White House meeting.
[00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:42.353]  I only tell you how dire the straits are, so you know we can attack in all directions, to quote the Marine Corps General in Florida.
[00:54:42.353 --> 00:54:43.133]  Ha ha ha!
[00:54:43.133 --> 00:54:46.094]  Victory is ours!
[00:54:46.094 --> 00:54:47.775]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[00:54:47.775 --> 00:54:49.196]  Thank you for holding.
[00:54:49.196 --> 00:54:49.876]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.081]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:53.341]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[00:54:53.341 --> 00:54:54.062]  How are you?
[00:54:54.062 --> 00:54:54.842]  I love you, man.
[00:54:54.842 --> 00:54:57.163]  I want to make a quick plug.
[00:54:57.163 --> 00:54:59.044]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[00:54:59.044 --> 00:55:15.511]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[00:55:16.169 --> 00:55:21.571]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[00:55:21.571 --> 00:55:35.076]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[00:55:35.076 --> 00:55:39.777]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this.
[00:55:39.777 --> 00:55:41.238]  So thanks for the plug.
[00:55:48.331 --> 00:55:54.636]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy or technocrats.
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:56:10.613]  You'll get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that they want businessmen technocrats over it.
[00:56:10.613 --> 00:56:11.954]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[00:56:11.954 --> 00:56:17.238]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[00:56:17.238 --> 00:56:19.961]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[00:56:20.953 --> 00:56:26.216]  See, he believes because he's hidden in plain view, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:28.338]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[00:56:28.338 --> 00:56:29.759]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[00:56:29.759 --> 00:56:34.282]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[00:56:34.282 --> 00:56:36.583]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism.
[00:56:36.583 --> 00:56:37.824]  In his own words.
[00:56:37.824 --> 00:56:43.267]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you, before you take those shots.
[00:56:43.267 --> 00:56:45.749]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[00:56:50.433 --> 00:56:57.298]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:57.298 --> 00:57:04.243]  Alright, I'm going to try to take these last callers on the line here before Patrick Byrne joins us for what is going to be a bombshell interview.
[00:57:04.243 --> 00:57:05.844]  Let's go quickly here.
[00:57:05.844 --> 00:57:08.586]  Sarah in Houston, you are on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:08.586 --> 00:57:10.447]  Go ahead, Sarah.
[00:57:10.447 --> 00:57:11.608]  Hi, Owen.
[00:57:11.608 --> 00:57:19.874]  Yes, I have to agree with Indiana and all the other callers as well as Alex in saying that it's really our duty
[00:57:20.447 --> 00:57:22.708]  To support the President.
[00:57:22.708 --> 00:57:33.095]  I can only imagine how terrible the situation is, and he's the only one there holding the line, but we're here behind him, but we need to... Occupy D.C.
[00:57:33.095 --> 00:57:34.656]  You can go for a day?
[00:57:34.656 --> 00:57:35.256]  Great.
[00:57:35.256 --> 00:57:37.858]  You can go for two, three, four?
[00:57:37.858 --> 00:57:38.578]  Awesome.
[00:57:38.578 --> 00:57:40.219]  We need to occupy D.C.
[00:57:40.219 --> 00:57:43.261]  If you can't go, then sponsor someone.
[00:57:43.261 --> 00:57:48.364]  Sponsor someone in your network, in your family, your friends.
[00:57:48.364 --> 00:57:49.305]  Someone to send.
[00:57:50.439 --> 00:57:59.021]  We need to be that spark to ignite this man so that he understands Donald Trump, understands that he's not alone in that den of lions.
[00:57:59.021 --> 00:58:06.543]  We're there with him, and the Holy Spirit is within all of us, and we together can unite to slay this dragon.
[00:58:06.543 --> 00:58:10.864]  It is a spiritual war, and you know what?
[00:58:10.864 --> 00:58:15.386]  It didn't really occur to me, and I've been a Christian all my life.
[00:58:15.386 --> 00:58:19.887]  My great-grandparents, the United Methodists, okay, they converted from Catholicism.
[00:58:20.889 --> 00:58:28.777]  And I have a five-month-old baby girl, and I went to my church, and I've been going for years.
[00:58:28.777 --> 00:58:30.478]  I wanted to baptize her.
[00:58:30.478 --> 00:58:41.548]  I went through the whole hour, whatever they have, you know, as a Methodist, you have to speak to the pastor to sort of tell you the liturgy of it and everything, which I love.
[00:58:41.548 --> 00:58:42.309]  I love liturgy.
[00:58:42.907 --> 00:58:43.347]  Okay.
[00:58:43.347 --> 00:58:44.888]  I love my church.
[00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:45.589]  Love God.
[00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:47.370]  Yeah, and churches need to be rising up.
[00:58:47.370 --> 00:58:48.190]  I mean, that's a big thing.
[00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:50.331]  I mean, preachers need to be organizing and activating.
[00:58:50.331 --> 00:58:50.932]  I mean, it's sad.
[00:58:50.932 --> 00:58:56.295]  These big mega churches, they just tell their flock, if you will, oh no, everything's fine.
[00:58:56.295 --> 00:58:57.315]  Oh no, just pray to God.
[00:58:57.315 --> 00:58:58.176]  Oh, everything will be fine.
[00:58:59.276 --> 00:59:00.977]  No, we're in a war right now.
[00:59:00.977 --> 00:59:02.658]  God wants us to fight.
[00:59:02.658 --> 00:59:07.181]  And if you can't get to D.C., by the way, rallies are happening at state capitals all the time, too.
[00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:09.882]  Saturdays at noon at state capitals seem to be the time.
[00:59:09.882 --> 00:59:10.743]  So, absolutely.
[00:59:10.743 --> 00:59:11.904]  Sarah, thank you so much for the call.
[00:59:11.904 --> 00:59:13.985]  Let's go to Mike in Irvine.
[00:59:13.985 --> 00:59:15.045]  I guess that's Irvine, Texas.
[00:59:15.045 --> 00:59:15.626]  Mike, go ahead.
[00:59:15.626 --> 00:59:20.749]  Yeah, it's actually Irvine, California.
[00:59:20.749 --> 00:59:22.330]  Irvine, California, Owen.
[00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:26.532]  Hey, I was on a sunset hike last night and listening to your show.
[00:59:27.336 --> 00:59:35.237]  And totally heard all of your meltdown about how all of this money from the COVID relief package isn't going to the people.
[00:59:35.237 --> 00:59:38.378]  It's going to all these other countries.
[00:59:38.378 --> 00:59:42.899]  I think 700 of the 900 billion is going outside the U.S.
[00:59:42.899 --> 00:59:52.820]  I mean, this is like if you gave your money to a financial advisor and said, hey, I want to put, you know, $50,000 into a college fund for my for my grandkids or something.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.401]  And then you come back the next day and you're like, hey, where'd that 50 grand go?
[00:59:56.081 --> 01:00:04.027]  And he said, well, you know, I got a new car and then I gave some to my mechanic and then, you know, I gave some to this contractor over here.
[01:00:04.027 --> 01:00:05.248]  I built myself a new house.
[01:00:05.248 --> 01:00:06.409]  I put some of it in my pocket.
[01:00:06.409 --> 01:00:10.132]  But don't worry, I put $50 in the college fund for your grandkids.
[01:00:10.132 --> 01:00:11.092]  I mean, you'd be like, what?
[01:00:11.092 --> 01:00:11.713]  You'd be outraged.
[01:00:11.713 --> 01:00:12.874]  You'd fire the guy immediately.
[01:00:12.874 --> 01:00:13.835]  You'd call for his arrest.
[01:00:13.835 --> 01:00:18.758]  I'm going to tell you and I'm going to tell the audience where that money went.
[01:00:18.758 --> 01:00:24.903]  That money is being used to pay off politicians, military, medical professionals.
[01:00:25.436 --> 01:00:31.058]  All over the globe so that Bill Gates' vaccine is going to be stuck in their arms.
[01:00:31.058 --> 01:00:32.218]  And the U.S.
[01:00:32.218 --> 01:00:34.119]  government is funding that.
[01:00:34.119 --> 01:00:39.941]  That's why Bill Gates, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, got billions of dollars in the COVID relief package.
[01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:54.598]  I mean, if that is the case, then Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi and whoever else wrote that and organized that, I mean, how is it these countries are like, are we talking to them?
[01:00:54.598 --> 01:00:55.819]  Hey, Egypt, how much money do you need?
[01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:57.080]  Hey, Israel, how much money do you need?
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.441]  I mean, what the hell, man?
[01:00:58.441 --> 01:01:03.645]  So, I mean, whoever wrote that bill should be immediately investigated, whether it was McConnell and Pelosi, I'd call them up front.
[01:01:03.985 --> 01:01:06.046]  So absolutely, it was ridiculous.
[01:01:06.046 --> 01:01:08.148]  And that's why Trump should go after the Republicans.
[01:01:08.148 --> 01:01:09.429]  He should call Mitch McConnell in.
[01:01:09.429 --> 01:01:12.170]  He should do it live on TV and say, Mitch McConnell, what the hell?
[01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:13.891]  Why did you just screw us over?
[01:01:13.891 --> 01:01:15.492]  Put Mitch's ass in the grass.
[01:01:15.492 --> 01:01:16.233]  Alright.
[01:01:16.233 --> 01:01:17.134]  Henry in Chicago.
[01:01:17.134 --> 01:01:18.174]  I got 30 seconds, man.
[01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:18.594]  I'm sorry.
[01:01:18.594 --> 01:01:25.139]  Go ahead.
[01:01:25.139 --> 01:01:26.700]  Henry, if you're there, fire off.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:30.542]  Alright, looks like we lost Henry out there in Chicago.
[01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:31.623]  Alright, when we come back.
[01:01:32.892 --> 01:01:34.234]  We're going to have Patrick burn on.
[01:01:34.234 --> 01:01:35.775]  He's not being subtle about this.
[01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:38.699]  He's been having meetings in the White House.
[01:01:38.699 --> 01:01:43.405]  So he's going to tell you what's going on, what's on his mind, the next level.
[01:01:43.405 --> 01:01:45.007]  And, I mean, this is incredible.
[01:01:45.007 --> 01:01:49.032]  It's almost like if you're thirsty in the desert, you can only drink so much before you're not thirsty anymore.
[01:01:49.032 --> 01:01:52.416]  I mean, there's so much evidence of voter fraud, it's like I'm sick of seeing it all.
[01:01:55.049 --> 01:01:59.233]  Christmas 2020 is here but will soon be gone.
[01:01:59.233 --> 01:02:11.663]  But I want to encourage all of you to recommit the year 2020, and I'm talking to myself when I say this, to exercise and to treat our bodies better and to take high quality supplements along with a nutritious diet.

[01:02:59.249 --> 01:03:01.932]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:03:01.932 --> 01:03:07.497]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:03:07.497 --> 01:03:10.360]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.525]  It's my great honor.
[01:03:14.525 --> 01:03:17.047]  We're about to be joined by Patrick Byrne.
[01:03:17.047 --> 01:03:20.591]  But ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand something.
[01:03:22.341 --> 01:03:25.682]  Running InfoWars is not a cheap enterprise.
[01:03:25.682 --> 01:03:30.524]  We have to build our own infrastructure, we have to pay for all the data processing, all of it.
[01:03:30.524 --> 01:03:34.786]  That's what happens when you get totally banned off of all the mainstream media stuff.
[01:03:34.786 --> 01:03:39.427]  Hey, that's fine, but we fund ourselves, you fund us by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:03:39.427 --> 01:03:44.289]  So, this hour, with Patrick Byrne, it's about to be a great interview here.
[01:03:44.289 --> 01:03:45.770]  He's been all over the headlines.
[01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:48.791]  This hour is brought to you by Winter Sun Plus.
[01:03:49.611 --> 01:03:52.893]  The greatest vitamin D supplement you're going to find.

[01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:06.944]  It's Winter Sun Plus, the premier vitamin D supplement.

[01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:15.370]  Patrick, you've not been subtle.
[01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:16.571]  You've been meeting in the White House.
[01:04:16.571 --> 01:04:21.314]  You've been calling out the fraud from a very analytical, technical level.
[01:04:21.314 --> 01:04:23.416]  Here you are today, back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:23.416 --> 01:04:26.278]  What do you have to report today?
[01:04:26.278 --> 01:04:27.999]  Hello, young man.
[01:04:27.999 --> 01:04:29.721]  What do I have to report to you?
[01:04:29.721 --> 01:04:31.182]  I'm sorry, I thought I was on with Alex.
[01:04:31.182 --> 01:04:32.083]  What's your name again, sir?
[01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:32.783]  I know we've met before.
[01:04:32.783 --> 01:04:33.524]  That's all right.
[01:04:33.524 --> 01:04:34.264]  Owens Troyer here.
[01:04:34.264 --> 01:04:34.885]  Hey, that's okay.
[01:04:34.885 --> 01:04:36.466]  I know you're very busy.
[01:04:36.466 --> 01:04:37.667]  Now you'll remember it, though.
[01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:39.671]  I will remember.
[01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:43.214]  You know, it's proper etiquette.
[01:04:43.214 --> 01:04:49.739]  If you get a chance to be in the White House and certainly in the Oval Office, one never is supposed to discuss what was discussed.
[01:04:49.739 --> 01:05:00.007]  However, 12 hours after I walked out of the Oval Office, there was a leak in the New York Times about that meeting.
[01:05:00.007 --> 01:05:05.872]  And I believe the leak came from the General Counsel, a guy named Pat Cipollone.
[01:05:06.956 --> 01:05:08.758]  And it was heavily spun.
[01:05:08.758 --> 01:05:16.464]  It was probably put out through his normal journalist, this woman named Maggie Haberman at the New York Times.
[01:05:16.464 --> 01:05:26.892]  And sure enough, 12 or 14 hours after I walked out, just after midnight of the White House, there was, by mid-afternoon the next day, there was this whole story about the meeting.
[01:05:26.892 --> 01:05:34.198]  The meeting was heavily, it was all, it was spun so badly, I thought, you know, I'm breaking etiquette.
[01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:44.416]  But if that guy who was in the meeting can leak and lie like a little weasel about what happened, it's incumbent upon me to... If he can lie, I can tell the truth publicly.
[01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:46.698]  If he can lie through leaks, I can tell the truth publicly.
[01:05:46.698 --> 01:05:48.219]  That's what I'm telling the truth publicly.
[01:05:48.219 --> 01:05:55.263]  The New York Times wrote a heavily spun version and there were some outright fabrications in it.
[01:05:55.263 --> 01:05:57.045]  It was absolutely false.
[01:05:57.045 --> 01:05:57.765]  Absolutely false.
[01:05:57.765 --> 01:05:59.106]  Martial law was discussed.
[01:06:00.241 --> 01:06:04.126]  Uh, or, or even, uh, the Insurrection Act was discussed.
[01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.567]  None of that was discussed in the meeting.
[01:06:05.567 --> 01:06:11.434]  That was pure fabrication on the part of that, uh, the leaker, who's the White House General Counsel.
[01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:14.056]  One of the interesting things that happened in the meeting.
[01:06:14.056 --> 01:06:20.203]  So I was in with General Flynn, Sidney Powell, another attorney who, that's, yeah, that's just, I see that headline.
[01:06:20.203 --> 01:06:21.024]  That's a flat lie.
[01:06:22.003 --> 01:06:24.164]  That's an absolute flat lie.
[01:06:24.164 --> 01:06:27.284]  And that's just an example of how the New York Times knows this.
[01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:31.105]  A lie makes its way around the world before the truth even puts its pants on.
[01:06:31.105 --> 01:06:37.647]  That's just a rewrite of the original New York Times false news from Business Insider and so other people pick it up.
[01:06:37.647 --> 01:06:38.867]  And it's funny that it's Maggie Haberman.
[01:06:38.867 --> 01:06:42.728]  I mean, she always seems to be the one lying about what goes on in D.C.
[01:06:42.728 --> 01:06:44.609]  She seems to be the henchman of the deep state.
[01:06:46.479 --> 01:06:49.961]  Yeah, well, it doesn't surprise me.
[01:06:49.961 --> 01:06:55.584]  What's really funny is while I was in the meeting, none of the reports that came out mentioned me.
[01:06:55.584 --> 01:07:05.891]  Not that I care about being mentioned, but some of the smarter people, a smart journalist, contacted me and said, and that was his first question, why would they leave you out?
[01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:08.372]  What do you make of the fact, Owen, that they would leave me out?
[01:07:08.372 --> 01:07:08.612]  Why?
[01:07:08.612 --> 01:07:12.415]  Well, they obviously don't want anybody, you know, looking you up.
[01:07:12.415 --> 01:07:16.137]  They don't want anybody seeing what you're actually saying, and that's how they try to control the narrative.
[01:07:16.957 --> 01:07:18.718]  Yeah, it's kind of funny.
[01:07:18.718 --> 01:07:24.581]  So that, uh, it was a horrible, it was a wonderful meeting in certain ways.
[01:07:24.581 --> 01:07:27.082]  One, my feelings about the president changed quite a bit.
[01:07:27.082 --> 01:07:29.683]  I, as I've mentioned before, I didn't vote for him.
[01:07:29.683 --> 01:07:33.745]  Uh, and I had, but I still sort of bought into the public perception.
[01:07:33.745 --> 01:07:39.788]  I can tell you he's quite a bit, quite a bit different than is commonly conveyed in the press.
[01:07:39.788 --> 01:07:43.290]  Uh, he's gentle and kind and rather soft-spoken.
[01:07:44.405 --> 01:07:49.289]  Uh, and when he got angry, he didn't get nearly as angry as I would have, or as angry as he should have.
[01:07:49.289 --> 01:07:51.211]  We caught his people in lies.
[01:07:51.211 --> 01:07:52.412]  They were lying to his face.
[01:07:52.412 --> 01:07:56.275]  There were points where his own lawyers were standing up and yelling at him.
[01:07:56.275 --> 01:08:02.460]  Now, what they were yelling was false, but on numerous occasions, they're giving horrible legal advice.
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:06.123]  But just the fact that they're sitting there yelling at the president in the Oval Office,
[01:08:07.632 --> 01:08:08.513]  It was surreal.
[01:08:08.513 --> 01:08:12.856]  Flynn and I started nudging each other and saying, is this the most surreal thing you ever saw?
[01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:15.158]  We started arguing with these lawyers.
[01:08:15.158 --> 01:08:22.083]  I've no, I'd say if there's one flaw that I see in general in President Trump is that he's too nice.
[01:08:22.083 --> 01:08:23.163]  He's way too nice.
[01:08:23.163 --> 01:08:27.587]  I wouldn't put up, I'd fire a cat like that in a New York minute if he ever spoke to me.
[01:08:27.587 --> 01:08:34.632]  And, but President Trump did turn to me several times and say, can you believe, we had a couple sort of CEO to CEO moments.
[01:08:35.814 --> 01:08:43.077]  And entrepreneur moments and on several occasions he said things like, can you believe what I have to put up with here?
[01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:45.398]  I've had to put up with this for four years.
[01:08:45.398 --> 01:08:59.042]  Can you imagine what I could have gotten done if I hadn't had if he even said at one point, you know, I've had right in front of them, by the way, this all happened right in front of them, you know, where he said things like all my life, I've had the best lawyers in the world.
[01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:02.344]  People call me from all over the world to say, what lawyer should I use on this?
[01:09:02.344 --> 01:09:03.144]  What should I use on that?
[01:09:04.062 --> 01:09:08.287]  These lawyers, can you believe what I put up with here?
[01:09:08.287 --> 01:09:10.749]  They're in perpetual no mode.
[01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:16.115]  Whatever gets asked or any questions or proposals, nope, nope, nope, we can't do that.
[01:09:16.115 --> 01:09:21.040]  And it's actually quite basic stuff.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.402]  I see that headline, that's another flat lie.
[01:09:23.402 --> 01:09:25.465]  You can see what General Flynn actually said
[01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:30.227]  Because what he said was in a Newsmax interview last Friday.
[01:09:30.227 --> 01:09:44.698]  So go and look at the Newsmax interview of General Flynn last Friday, and you can see what he said is, if we have to, you know, we've got to stay within the Constitution, but if we have to rerun election in some of these swing states, we'd have the military rerun the election, you know, so everyone would trust it.
[01:09:44.698 --> 01:09:46.559]  And that's all he said.
[01:09:46.559 --> 01:09:52.164]  And from that statement in Newsmax, and by the way, elections get rerun in this country.
[01:09:52.164 --> 01:09:55.346]  There was one rerun last year in, I think it was Louisiana.
[01:09:56.139 --> 01:10:11.112]  Um, and you know, when election, when it goes to a judge, if the judge can pull out, if there's been cheating and the judge can extract what the cheating was, you can then, you know, you can take the election results and then extract the cheating and you have the real results.
[01:10:11.112 --> 01:10:16.057]  But if the cheating is so intense and it scrambles up the whole election,
[01:10:16.618 --> 01:10:19.060]  There's no way to extract it.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.383]  At that point a judge orders a rerun of the election.
[01:10:23.383 --> 01:10:38.653]  I want to get back to the White House meeting for a second because I think this is such a key window into what Trump is dealing with and honestly his calmness in this situation kind of gives me some more confidence that he knows he's on solid footing and he has the ace of spades in his hand if you will.
[01:10:39.494 --> 01:10:41.275]  He's been dealing with this for four years.
[01:10:41.275 --> 01:10:43.136]  I want you to kind of reiterate that.
[01:10:43.136 --> 01:10:54.901]  The arrogance of New York City and Washington D.C., mostly politicos, that go into the White House and point their finger at Trump telling him how to do the job, telling him how the country is run.
[01:10:54.901 --> 01:10:56.541]  They have no jurisdiction.
[01:10:56.541 --> 01:10:58.002]  Nobody elected them.
[01:10:58.002 --> 01:11:00.343]  And it just shows how these people in D.C.
[01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:01.704]  really think they're above everybody.
[01:11:01.704 --> 01:11:04.225]  I mean, they have the most elitist approach to everything.
[01:11:04.225 --> 01:11:07.306]  And it makes me sick knowing that that's what the president deals with every day.
[01:11:08.407 --> 01:11:13.838]  Oh, it would have made you sick to see what we what we saw from these from the people around him.
[01:11:13.838 --> 01:11:16.143]  They're mediocre.
[01:11:16.937 --> 01:11:19.799]  Mendacious mediocrities, as I think I described.
[01:11:19.799 --> 01:11:21.380]  Mendacious mediocrities.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:24.762]  You know, everything that was proposed, they would say, no, you can't do that.
[01:11:24.762 --> 01:11:27.664]  And, you know, Sidney or Flynn would say, of course he can do that.
[01:11:27.664 --> 01:11:29.265]  He can right now, you know.
[01:11:29.265 --> 01:11:35.069]  So at one point he said, well, I would like to hire Sidney as special counsel, special White House counsel.
[01:11:35.069 --> 01:11:41.833]  And they say, well, the clearance process is going to take X many months and this and that.
[01:11:41.833 --> 01:11:46.476]  He's like, and Flynn says, you have the right right now to declare that she has a top secret clearance.
[01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:48.791]  And you have the right to hire him.
[01:11:48.791 --> 01:11:52.452]  So everything that was proposed, they were saying, no, no, no, you can't do that.
[01:11:52.452 --> 01:11:56.114]  And it turns out he has the authority to do all of that on his word.
[01:11:56.114 --> 01:11:59.635]  He can say, Sidney Powell, you now have a top secret clearance, which he did.
[01:11:59.635 --> 01:12:04.618]  He also said, Sidney Powell, I've decided to hire you, your White House special counsel.
[01:12:04.618 --> 01:12:07.119]  To give you a great example, he did that.
[01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:07.979]  He hired her.
[01:12:07.979 --> 01:12:09.820]  He told her your White House special counsel.
[01:12:10.623 --> 01:12:18.832]  With a top-secret clearance, the next morning, Sidney called Mark Meadows and said, OK, this is Saturday morning, looks like I'm going to need an office in the White House.
[01:12:18.832 --> 01:12:22.475]  And Mark Meadows said, oh, no, sorry, we don't know if we can really get that done.
[01:12:22.475 --> 01:12:27.200]  And she said, well, OK, at least I need a pass, a badge, so I can come and go.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.823]  Mark Meadows said, oh, no, I'm not sure we can get that done either.
[01:12:30.363 --> 01:12:35.026]  You know, so they were just undercutting and submarining and sabotaging the direct orders.
[01:12:35.026 --> 01:12:42.289]  You know, he's in the room when he heard it, and the next morning he's just absolutely, he and the General Counsel are refusing to execute the President's orders.
[01:12:42.289 --> 01:12:44.150]  I mean, this is unbelievable, folks.
[01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:46.571]  This is an eyewitness account to this.
[01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:47.952]  You have D.C.
[01:12:47.952 --> 01:12:51.734]  politicos who are trying to be the President of the United States.
[01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:52.895]  We'll be right back with Patrick Byrne.

[01:13:11.823 --> 01:13:13.364]  Ban.video.
[01:13:13.364 --> 01:13:16.865]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[01:13:16.865 --> 01:13:21.868]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:23.529]  We're good.
[01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:56.870]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:13:56.870 --> 01:14:01.192]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:14:01.192 --> 01:14:09.697]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:14:10.057 --> 01:14:26.668]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:14:26.668 --> 01:14:37.715]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:14:38.195 --> 01:14:46.680]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.

[01:15:12.063 --> 01:15:19.106]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:19.106 --> 01:15:28.850]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:31.712]  We are back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:32.964 --> 01:15:45.778]  Patrick Byrne is with us from a remote location and he's talking about the White House meeting that he was in, which has been incredibly bombshell, the details that have emerged so far.
[01:15:45.778 --> 01:15:50.142]  And what's interesting about this, not just the details that Patrick is discussing here, but
[01:15:50.703 --> 01:16:02.670]  The coverage of this, and how you apply it to the four years under Trump, how the media lies about everything that happens in the White House, they lie about Trump, they lie about his advisors, and it's all D.C.
[01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:13.957]  embedded politicos that think they're bigger than the White House, bigger than the American people, doesn't matter who's in office, they think they run the country, and just like I said in the first hour with Alex, it's a bunch of people telling him what he can't do!
[01:16:14.477 --> 01:16:17.520]  And he needs people in there telling him what he can do and it sounds like that's what's going on.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:26.367]  So, Patrick Byrne, are there any other details from this meeting or any other lies you want to address about this meeting that the media is perpetuating?
[01:16:26.367 --> 01:16:26.627]  Sure.
[01:16:26.627 --> 01:16:31.972]  Well, I'm sure that the journalist is no staunch
[01:16:33.058 --> 01:16:35.899]  Defender of Trump or defender of the truth.
[01:16:35.899 --> 01:16:37.840]  I wouldn't put the lies down to her.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.723]  This is the general counsel lied What's going on is these folks?
[01:16:42.723 --> 01:16:44.583]  Trying to get this set up a little bit better.
[01:16:44.583 --> 01:16:56.429]  What's going on is these folks here are being told in Washington they have jobs one of the three lawyers that was his last day and he had a job I don't what you guys are doing with your camera.
[01:16:56.429 --> 01:16:57.650]  You're actually great right there.
[01:16:57.650 --> 01:17:00.031]  Don't worry about it Patrick he had a
[01:17:01.816 --> 01:17:05.193]  It was his, one of the people, it was his last day and the president said...
[01:17:05.836 --> 01:17:20.467]  And that fellow seemed like an okay guy, kind of milk toast, but it was his last day on the job and the president said at one point, you know this fellow's leaving me, he's been making ten times as much money across town, so you're leaving me for a job he can make ten times as much money across town.
[01:17:20.467 --> 01:17:33.017]  All of these people are being told if you do good work and get the president out the door on January 20, there'll be jobs waiting for you, a million and a half dollar, two million dollar jobs at Sullivan Cromwell and places like that.
[01:17:33.687 --> 01:17:39.389]  If there'll be, you know, you'll be accepted in socialite circles in New York.
[01:17:39.389 --> 01:17:42.250]  If you don't, all that goes away.
[01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:44.751]  So all of these people are in the mode of getting them out.
[01:17:44.751 --> 01:17:47.272]  I have numerous young people in the administration.
[01:17:47.272 --> 01:17:50.093]  And so I've spent two months in D.C.
[01:17:50.093 --> 01:17:51.754]  and sort of swimming around the edges of this.
[01:17:52.406 --> 01:17:58.388]  And numerous younger people in the administration are being told, just get the president to concede.
[01:17:58.388 --> 01:17:59.528]  Just get him to concede.
[01:17:59.528 --> 01:18:01.008]  Help him get in transition mode.
[01:18:01.008 --> 01:18:02.649]  Help us get him in transition mode.
[01:18:02.649 --> 01:18:08.070]  So the young people in the White House, who work in the White House, are being told that by their superiors.
[01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:12.151]  And that includes the Office of the General Counsel, and that includes Mark Meadows.
[01:18:12.151 --> 01:18:17.313]  So President Trump is relying on advice from people whose mentality is that.
[01:18:18.321 --> 01:18:19.562]  And he's getting horrified.
[01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:23.305]  Well, that kind of sounds like an end around, and I don't want people to assume who you're talking about here.
[01:18:23.305 --> 01:18:25.347]  Obviously, you don't have to name names.
[01:18:25.347 --> 01:18:28.009]  But that sounds like an end around where the D.C.
[01:18:28.009 --> 01:18:31.211]  corrupt establishment is going to these young people that, you know, they kind of want to get around.
[01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:32.212]  They want to build a resume.
[01:18:32.212 --> 01:18:33.913]  They want to get this reputation.
[01:18:33.913 --> 01:18:38.117]  So they're saying, oh, you know, oh, go tell Trump to concede and you'll stick around in D.C.
[01:18:38.117 --> 01:18:41.059]  And they're probably just like, well, I guess this is what I have to do to stick around.
[01:18:41.059 --> 01:18:43.861]  Is there any resistance there?
[01:18:43.861 --> 01:18:44.962]  There's definite resistance.
[01:18:44.962 --> 01:18:47.163]  The young people who work there love them.
[01:18:47.163 --> 01:18:47.724]  They love them.
[01:18:48.496 --> 01:18:50.658]  And I don't think they're getting that.
[01:18:50.658 --> 01:18:53.760]  I mean, they may be getting that message subtly from the D.C.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.461]  establishment.
[01:18:54.461 --> 01:18:57.943]  What's more problematic is they're getting it from their bosses.
[01:18:57.943 --> 01:19:00.445]  Their bosses are giving them this message.
[01:19:00.445 --> 01:19:03.448]  And when I did inform that, I won't tell you much about what Trump said.
[01:19:03.448 --> 01:19:06.510]  I'm going to tell you what went on between myself and the lawyers.
[01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:07.531]  I'll name two names.
[01:19:07.531 --> 01:19:08.932]  Pat Cipollone.
[01:19:08.932 --> 01:19:11.694]  And now Mark Meadows, I happen, he's a nice man.
[01:19:11.694 --> 01:19:13.496]  I don't think he's venal.
[01:19:13.496 --> 01:19:14.897]  I think Pat Cipollone is venal.
[01:19:14.897 --> 01:19:16.458]  I think Mark Meadows is a weak man.
[01:19:16.958 --> 01:19:18.580]  And he's probably got some job lined up.
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:24.826]  I bet you'll see him with a job at a lobbying firm for a million bucks a year or more before the winter's over.
[01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:25.687]  I'll make that prediction.
[01:19:25.687 --> 01:19:27.048]  That's just the way things work here.
[01:19:27.048 --> 01:19:32.414]  So they, it's the problem is the leadership in the White House is telling this to the people below.
[01:19:32.414 --> 01:19:33.535]  That's pretty crazy.
[01:19:34.016 --> 01:19:36.517]  So they are giving horrible advice.
[01:19:36.517 --> 01:19:38.998]  The people closest to Trump are giving horrible advice.
[01:19:38.998 --> 01:19:43.440]  And since all this happened Friday, they have thrown an iron curtain around Trump.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.561]  No one can get to him.
[01:19:44.561 --> 01:19:45.961]  No one can get to him with information.
[01:19:45.961 --> 01:19:51.524]  I mean, people are telling me who have been able for four years, people who could pick up the phone and call Trump.
[01:19:52.684 --> 01:19:58.390]  Our President Trump are being told they cannot talk to him.
[01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:05.616]  Mark Meadows and the General Counsel have thrown Trump in a box since Saturday and no one can get to the guy.
[01:20:05.616 --> 01:20:08.219]  Even longtime acquaintances, longtime supporters.
[01:20:08.775 --> 01:20:17.019]  Everything, as well as... So, the problem is the leadership in the White House is giving this order down.
[01:20:17.019 --> 01:20:18.780]  I confronted them in front of Trump.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.541]  I told all this to President Trump in front of them.
[01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:22.641]  And he said, who?
[01:20:22.641 --> 01:20:23.522]  Who is doing that?
[01:20:23.522 --> 01:20:26.343]  And I said, this is Pat Cipollone, right?
[01:20:26.343 --> 01:20:28.064]  That's him.
[01:20:28.064 --> 01:20:34.307]  I can get three people up here in 30 minutes who can tell you that they are getting orders from this guy to get you to concede.
[01:20:35.083 --> 01:20:39.724]  Which is down to top order, which is completely out of sync.
[01:20:39.724 --> 01:20:42.845]  I mean, I don't know if that's how it normally goes, but no, the president is the boss.
[01:20:42.845 --> 01:20:49.987]  Now doesn't this just confirm to you, and you mentioned this, how your opinion of Trump changed, doesn't this confirm to you how real Trump is?
[01:20:49.987 --> 01:20:51.447]  He has the grassroots.
[01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:53.267]  He really wants to fight for the country.
[01:20:53.267 --> 01:20:57.128]  He's shocked at how surrounded he is by traitors and corrupt individuals.
[01:20:57.128 --> 01:21:04.270]  So, I mean, talk about that personal level of just, hey, this is a genuine guy who is not at all what the media is portraying him to be.
[01:21:04.884 --> 01:21:06.385]  He's not at all with the media.
[01:21:06.385 --> 01:21:09.926]  So I think I was clear on your show before I did not vote for Mr. Trump.
[01:21:09.926 --> 01:21:12.067]  I was never, I was not a never Trumper.
[01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:14.508]  You know, I vote Libertarian all my life.
[01:21:14.508 --> 01:21:17.509]  I voted Libertarian for president since the first time I voted.
[01:21:17.509 --> 01:21:22.190]  And so I've never voted for a man who won because all we've had are Republicans and Democrats.
[01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:27.172]  But all that said, you know, my attitude is also who wins, I salute and that's the president.
[01:21:27.172 --> 01:21:34.115]  And, you know, and, uh, so, uh, he's a very genuine and nice guy.
[01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:37.602]  He's another thing he's really smart and I don't mean to be
[01:21:40.484 --> 01:21:42.465]  Obnoxious about it, but I'm a CEO.
[01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:45.167]  I've built a number of businesses, including a $2 billion business.
[01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:48.149]  When I'm meeting with people like this, I'm always evaluating.
[01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:49.590]  It's just natural to me.
[01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:57.155]  See how quickly they get things, how quickly they get jokes, how quickly they put together things that were said in different parts of the conversation.
[01:21:57.155 --> 01:21:59.136]  President Trump is really smart.
[01:21:59.136 --> 01:22:01.738]  I spend time with lots of really smart people.
[01:22:01.738 --> 01:22:04.860]  Well, not lots of, I spend time with few people this bright.
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.661]  I mean, he's very smart.
[01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:07.782]  He puts things together so quickly.
[01:22:09.835 --> 01:22:13.878]  And he sees through BS very quickly.
[01:22:13.878 --> 01:22:15.339]  He's a really bright guy.
[01:22:15.339 --> 01:22:25.025]  And I guess I've learned since then that his uncle, some of the media doesn't mention, I'm told his uncle was the president of MIT and that he had a lot of influence from his uncle.
[01:22:25.025 --> 01:22:27.507]  Are you talking about his uncle John Trump?
[01:22:27.507 --> 01:22:28.448]  Don't know, don't know.
[01:22:28.448 --> 01:22:32.450]  I never met the same one that was involved with the Tesla papers.
[01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:32.951]  That's wild.
[01:22:33.996 --> 01:22:34.776]  I don't know.
[01:22:34.776 --> 01:22:41.220]  He's a very intelligent man, and he's also quite a bit kinder and gentler than I would have ever guessed.
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:46.683]  Well, and you said he was nice, too, and we have a minute, and I just want to address this before we get into the final segment with you.
[01:22:46.683 --> 01:22:49.624]  To me, the niceness, I take that as confidence.
[01:22:49.624 --> 01:22:56.108]  I mean, when I'm nice in a hostile situation, that means I'm confident in my stance and I have the final move.
[01:22:56.108 --> 01:22:57.569]  I have the ace of spades.
[01:22:57.569 --> 01:23:01.711]  Do you take that same approach when you see Trump being so nice to these people?
[01:23:04.864 --> 01:23:08.312]  Well, from your lips to God's ear, I don't know.
[01:23:08.312 --> 01:23:13.563]  I think one thing I determined is what a mistake it was to get rid of Flynn.
[01:23:14.338 --> 01:23:19.559]  You know, it was Pence who pushed Flynn out, and Pence made a big deal about it.
[01:23:19.559 --> 01:23:21.540]  He should never have gotten rid of Flynn.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:24.440]  Flynn would have straightened these guys out, and they knew Eric Bannon.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.581]  We straightened them out right there.
[01:23:25.581 --> 01:23:30.742]  There was a point where General Flynn got on his feet and said, can we just ask, you know, let me ask you a simple question.
[01:23:30.742 --> 01:23:34.863]  You folks, you do think he won on November 3rd, right?
[01:23:34.863 --> 01:23:40.764]  And three lawyers put their toe in the dirt and hemmed and hawed and wouldn't give a straight answer.
[01:23:41.264 --> 01:23:43.605]  It's like, come on, so what are we even talking about?
[01:23:43.605 --> 01:23:47.088]  See, that's so, and that's so brilliant for Trump to just put this simple question.
[01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:49.809]  Hey, does anybody here think 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[01:23:49.809 --> 01:23:50.690]  Some people say no.
[01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:52.651]  Okay, you're a problem.
[01:23:52.651 --> 01:24:07.159]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold, you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[01:24:07.159 --> 01:24:08.881]  Well, that's where we are in the year 2020.
[01:24:09.881 --> 01:24:13.824]  Global government, the United Nations, all these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it.
[01:24:13.824 --> 01:24:21.370]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control, and that they're not even worried about COVID-19.
[01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:23.772]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[01:24:23.772 --> 01:24:25.153]  Think about how insane that is.
[01:24:25.153 --> 01:24:27.094]  Oh, and big tech's got to track you.
[01:24:27.094 --> 01:24:27.895]  They've got to trace you.
[01:24:27.895 --> 01:24:28.656]  They've got to control you.
[01:24:28.656 --> 01:24:30.817]  You've got to have apps leave your house.
[01:24:30.817 --> 01:24:31.438]  Why?
[01:24:31.438 --> 01:24:33.920]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you because
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:41.489]  My God, this thing has one-tenth of one percent chance of killing you if you're debilitated and have cancer or a heart attack.
[01:24:41.489 --> 01:24:43.131]  This is their takeover.
[01:24:43.131 --> 01:24:45.454]  Imagine on America's death certificate.
[01:24:45.454 --> 01:24:47.977]  Killed by the fear of the common cold.
[01:24:47.977 --> 01:24:49.099]  Yeah, that's fear-mongering.
[01:24:49.099 --> 01:24:49.800]  That's mind control.
[01:24:51.877 --> 01:24:54.258]  The post-industrial world.
[01:24:54.258 --> 01:25:03.520]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.022]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[01:25:08.022 --> 01:25:13.903]  Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:19.247]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:22.892]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[01:25:22.892 --> 01:25:24.854]  It is making the population poor.
[01:25:24.854 --> 01:25:30.782]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[01:25:30.782 --> 01:25:34.086]  They're destroying civilization, rebuilding it, and they're dystopic.
[01:25:35.027 --> 01:25:36.408]  Image.
[01:25:36.408 --> 01:25:40.351]  We are fighting this at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:25:40.351 --> 01:25:47.476]  We are fighting for a pro-human future, and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others, and join the fight.
[01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:48.357]  God bless you.
[01:25:48.357 --> 01:25:51.860]  Visit us, spread the word, at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.081]  You must guard your humanity.
[01:25:54.081 --> 01:25:56.923]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[01:25:56.923 --> 01:25:59.705]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[01:25:59.705 --> 01:26:02.688]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world.
[01:26:03.982 --> 01:26:08.206]  They are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[01:26:08.206 --> 01:26:15.613]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on Earth through the GMO crops.
[01:26:15.613 --> 01:26:22.600]  And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity, with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.824]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted, cloned fetuses.
[01:26:28.007 --> 01:26:30.289]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:27:10.322 --> 01:27:13.465]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:13.465 --> 01:27:16.187]  Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:27:16.187 --> 01:27:18.889]  Patrick Byrne is with us for one more segment.
[01:27:18.889 --> 01:27:21.451]  It's been an incredible interview.
[01:27:21.451 --> 01:27:23.613]  We've got a few things to address before he departs.
[01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:32.973]  One, the fact, Patrick, that they put the removal of the Insurrection Act into this COVID bill means that they're afraid.
[01:27:32.973 --> 01:27:35.074]  I know that that wasn't brought up in the White House meeting.
[01:27:35.074 --> 01:27:35.835]  I don't mean to interrupt.
[01:27:35.835 --> 01:27:36.895]  I'm supposed to be off right now.
[01:27:36.895 --> 01:27:37.935]  I appreciate Patrick coming on.
[01:27:37.935 --> 01:27:38.796]  He's amazing.
[01:27:38.796 --> 01:27:40.076]  I checked with folks who were in the meeting.
[01:27:40.076 --> 01:27:41.317]  He's totally there.
[01:27:41.317 --> 01:27:41.917]  It all happened.
[01:27:41.917 --> 01:27:42.437]  He's amazing.
[01:27:42.437 --> 01:27:44.218]  We appreciate his patriotism.
[01:27:44.218 --> 01:27:45.999]  You're getting there with the question, but I've got to ask.
[01:27:46.579 --> 01:27:52.303]  Get into the Martial Law discussion, get into the Insurrection Act discussion, and what really happened versus what the media says.
[01:27:52.303 --> 01:27:53.964]  This is major breaking news.
[01:27:53.964 --> 01:27:54.484]  Sorry to interrupt.
[01:27:54.484 --> 01:27:55.665]  You were already there, but I ran in here.
[01:27:55.665 --> 01:27:57.146]  Go ahead.
[01:27:57.146 --> 01:27:58.347]  Sure.
[01:27:58.347 --> 01:27:59.648]  Hello, Alex.
[01:27:59.648 --> 01:28:06.713]  Well, if you want to know the entirety of the Martial Law and Insurrection Act discussion, you can see for yourself.
[01:28:06.713 --> 01:28:10.835]  Look up Newsmax last Friday, which would have been, what, the 18th?
[01:28:12.136 --> 01:28:22.144]  General Flynn was on Newsmax, and at one point in the Newsmax, when they were saying what can be done, he said, Trump has options.
[01:28:22.144 --> 01:28:27.488]  And if, you know, I don't know the direct quote, I don't remember the word for word quote, but it was a very measured thing.
[01:28:27.488 --> 01:28:28.969]  Trump has options.
[01:28:28.969 --> 01:28:35.374]  If there's a rerun of this election in those six swing states, he could bring in the military to rerun the election.
[01:28:36.014 --> 01:28:38.534]  That's all he said, and then he went on with other things.
[01:28:38.534 --> 01:28:46.976]  That has gotten spun up into this nonsense that General Flynn was calling for martial law, and then as far as what he said in the White House about it, that's really simple to convey.
[01:28:46.976 --> 01:28:53.077]  I saw, I was there for four and a half hours, every word of the conversation, this is what he said about it in the White House.
[01:28:53.077 --> 01:28:54.197]  Zero.
[01:28:54.197 --> 01:28:54.617]  Zero.
[01:28:54.617 --> 01:28:56.258]  It's a flat fabrication.
[01:28:56.258 --> 01:28:58.178]  There was any discussion that he's in.
[01:28:58.178 --> 01:29:03.299]  So all of this that is being spun up and amplified and such is pure fabrication.
[01:29:04.076 --> 01:29:09.659]  So to me that just represents that they're afraid of that, because Trump doesn't even bring it up.
[01:29:09.659 --> 01:29:13.422]  So they bring it up like, oh no, he can't do that, he never even brought it up.
[01:29:13.422 --> 01:29:15.663]  So they're the ones thinking about it, because they're the ones committing the crime.
[01:29:15.663 --> 01:29:17.604]  Now those are my words, not Patrick's.
[01:29:17.604 --> 01:29:19.906]  But let's get back to where you're at.
[01:29:19.906 --> 01:29:22.967]  So you're in the White House, Sidney Powell is there, others.
[01:29:22.967 --> 01:29:30.372]  Trump is essentially drafting American citizens, American heroes, whether they voted for him or not, like yourself, to say, hey look,
[01:29:30.812 --> 01:29:35.676]  I'm not getting any help from within, you know, what do you make of this steal of our election?
[01:29:35.676 --> 01:29:45.044]  You, as somebody I would consider an expert in, you know, in technology, you know, I'm putting words in your mouth perhaps, but you're an expert in technology.
[01:29:45.044 --> 01:29:46.585]  So he says, you know, what do you think about this?
[01:29:46.585 --> 01:29:52.610]  And you say, look, I mean, to me, Patrick, it's like, if you're thirsty in the desert, you can only drink so much water before you're sick of water.
[01:29:53.166 --> 01:29:57.715]  I'm so, I've seen so much evidence of election fraud, it's like I don't even want to see it anymore!
[01:29:57.715 --> 01:30:03.086]  I mean now you have, they flip votes in Pennsylvania, dead people, I mean it's just non-stop, it's over the top!
[01:30:03.962 --> 01:30:08.603]  There's so much more that it keeps coming in that I can't tell you about yet.
[01:30:08.603 --> 01:30:11.223]  I mean, that's really the problem.
[01:30:11.223 --> 01:30:14.024]  I'm working with the real technologists.
[01:30:14.024 --> 01:30:16.244]  I'm not a technologist, but I play one on TV.
[01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:17.965]  I'm a philosopher of technology.
[01:30:17.965 --> 01:30:22.966]  I had a thousand of them working for me, and I built Overstock.com, built a $2 billion e-commerce company.
[01:30:22.966 --> 01:30:30.787]  I can tell you that we're digging stuff up, and as we dig stuff up, we're feeding it to the lawyers, and as the lawyers get it,
[01:30:31.397 --> 01:30:35.602]  You know, they're turning it into filings and interviewing, making it official and such.
[01:30:35.602 --> 01:30:41.808]  So what the lawyers are filing is always about maybe one to two weeks behind where our state of knowledge is.
[01:30:41.808 --> 01:30:50.838]  Now, as of three weeks ago, Sidney Powell filed some cases at the Supreme Court, and it reflects our state of knowledge as of about three or four weeks ago.
[01:30:51.397 --> 01:30:53.638]  What we have now is a mountain.
[01:30:53.638 --> 01:31:13.230]  All that time is our enemy, but what we have, I mean, we have, I put, I mentioned in something yesterday, we now have a direct connection between a Chinese company coming in over the internet to a, to a wireless and a, and a thermostat and accounting room connecting to a,
[01:31:15.023 --> 01:31:20.185]  Dominion machine in the counting room that's doing the tabulation during the actual counting.
[01:31:20.185 --> 01:31:21.726]  All that soup to nuts.
[01:31:21.726 --> 01:31:22.866]  This is actually incredible.
[01:31:22.866 --> 01:31:23.827]  I've never heard this.
[01:31:23.827 --> 01:31:31.170]  They're using the smart meters and the smart grid as like a proxy to hack into the voting machines.
[01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:31.290]  Yep.
[01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:40.073]  And we have all that right down to the IP addresses and everything, and the company back in China, the IP address of the company back in China.
[01:31:40.073 --> 01:31:40.753]  And what do you know?
[01:31:40.753 --> 01:31:45.474]  It's a company back in China whose name has already come up at the periphery of some of these matters.
[01:31:45.474 --> 01:31:47.915]  I wonder if it's a company that the Bidens aren't involved in.
[01:31:47.915 --> 01:31:49.976]  I've got five minutes left with you here.
[01:31:49.976 --> 01:31:52.437]  I've got so many questions.
[01:31:52.437 --> 01:31:53.217]  Let me ask you this.
[01:31:54.315 --> 01:32:06.382]  What do you think, or what has Trump said, or maybe you can't say that, but what do you think Trump is going to do about all of this, and what do you think Americans should do about this theft of our election?
[01:32:06.382 --> 01:32:17.308]  The bigger, I don't want to make any predictions for the President, that's his own thing, but I can tell you what the President needs you to do, needs your viewers to do, and that is, it is time we
[01:32:18.777 --> 01:32:26.502]  In a civil and respectful First Amendment kind of manner, begin planning to peaceably assemble.
[01:32:26.502 --> 01:32:28.403]  And the emphasis there is on peaceably.
[01:32:28.403 --> 01:32:29.584]  We're the good guys.
[01:32:29.584 --> 01:32:31.765]  We maintain the moral high ground.
[01:32:31.765 --> 01:32:38.189]  On the other hand, we don't need to get our asses kicked anymore in the streets by goons, as has been going on for months.
[01:32:38.189 --> 01:32:39.050]  And intimidated.
[01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:40.931]  They're bringing intimidation.
[01:32:43.261 --> 01:32:43.581]  I don't know.
[01:33:10.464 --> 01:33:13.033]  To show Congress we do not bend a knee.
[01:33:13.033 --> 01:33:16.625]  They've asked us to bend a knee to intrusions on freedom of speech, freedom of religion.
[01:33:17.598 --> 01:33:20.560]  Rights to assemble without goons attacking us.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.322]  You know, innocent until proven guilty.
[01:33:22.322 --> 01:33:25.564]  All kinds of things have been compromised in the last decade or two.
[01:33:25.564 --> 01:33:29.947]  We're not going to compromise on accepting a fraudulent election.
[01:33:29.947 --> 01:33:35.051]  Because when you compromise on, the core value of our system is consent of the governed.
[01:33:35.051 --> 01:33:38.953]  First thing you learn in third grade about our country, consent of the governed.
[01:33:38.953 --> 01:33:41.835]  Which, how do you figure out what the governed consent to?
[01:33:41.835 --> 01:33:45.338]  You figure it out by having elections that are free, fair, and transparent.
[01:33:45.738 --> 01:33:51.701]  If we bend the knee to this, we are betraying the most fundamental concept of the American experiment.
[01:33:51.701 --> 01:33:56.344]  So we cannot accept an obviously fraudulent election.
[01:33:56.344 --> 01:33:58.645]  And we got a protest in Washington, D.C.
[01:33:58.645 --> 01:33:59.726]  And I'm not a violent guy.
[01:33:59.726 --> 01:34:01.127]  I'm not a protester.
[01:34:01.127 --> 01:34:05.769]  But I want millions of people here for at least the 5th and 6th.
[01:34:05.769 --> 01:34:09.251]  The Congress is going to be meeting on the 1 o'clock on the 6th.
[01:34:09.251 --> 01:34:10.992]  We have to make clear to them.
[01:34:10.992 --> 01:34:13.573]  And if you can't make it to D.C., you're doing it in your state capitol.
[01:34:14.834 --> 01:34:24.797]  We have to do something that's never been done on our side, that in my lifetime we have to take to the streets and make our displeasure and refusal to accept.
[01:34:24.797 --> 01:34:27.118]  You know, here's another thing you need to know about Trump.
[01:34:27.118 --> 01:34:29.919]  He said very clearly, look, if we investigate this
[01:34:30.559 --> 01:34:30.639]  Yes.
[01:34:50.064 --> 01:34:50.705]  Yeah.
[01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:18.938]  You know, today, Kemp, Governor Kemp was down in Georgia and he went somewhere to do some rally and he was mobbed by people saying, you're a traitor and all this stuff.
[01:35:18.938 --> 01:35:24.962]  And he started lying and saying, oh, no one's done more for President Trump than I have and things like this.
[01:35:24.962 --> 01:35:25.803]  It's all a lie.
[01:35:25.803 --> 01:35:32.988]  We have to confront our politicians, just like the goons are confronting people, except we do it like adults and we do it without threatening violence.
[01:35:34.218 --> 01:35:40.125]  And we have to, American people cannot accept this and have to let their politicians know this is inappropriate.
[01:35:40.125 --> 01:35:41.707]  We're not going to bend any to it.
[01:35:41.707 --> 01:35:42.908]  We just want an answer.
[01:35:42.908 --> 01:35:44.871]  We want an investigation and we want an answer.
[01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:53.956]  Alright Patrick, and by the way, what you're describing there with the goons and the thugs in the streets, that's the definition of terrorism.
[01:35:53.956 --> 01:35:58.420]  Now that's my words, not Patrick's, but that's what it is when they're out beating us and intimidating us in the streets.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:59.701]  One more quick question.
[01:35:59.701 --> 01:36:03.505]  Did the issue of internet censorship come up in the White House meetings?
[01:36:03.505 --> 01:36:05.667]  Because you talk about the iron curtain around Trump.
[01:36:05.667 --> 01:36:10.832]  I mean, we know he's on Twitter, but if the information isn't on there because it's being censored, is he still getting it?
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:19.542]  He's, uh, well there's really, there's an iron curtain around him and there's an iron curtain around the American people.
[01:36:19.542 --> 01:36:23.364]  You can't say certain things on Twitter, you can't put certain things on YouTube.
[01:36:23.364 --> 01:36:25.505]  When did, when did this happen in America?
[01:36:26.795 --> 01:36:27.876]  You know, hydrochloroquine.
[01:36:27.876 --> 01:36:34.319]  I wonder if it's still illegal on YouTube to discuss the dangerous hydrochloroquine.
[01:36:34.319 --> 01:36:36.160]  He's got an iron curtain around him.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.621]  We have one about us around us.
[01:36:38.621 --> 01:36:40.121]  Listen, it's not going to get any better.
[01:36:40.121 --> 01:36:43.003]  If you bend a knee to this, it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:36:43.003 --> 01:36:45.964]  The craziness you experienced in the last year is going to get worse.
[01:36:45.964 --> 01:36:47.545]  Thank you so much, Patrick.
[01:36:47.545 --> 01:36:48.185]  We salute you.
[01:36:48.185 --> 01:36:50.866]  Look forward to talking again soon and seeing you in D.C.
[01:36:50.866 --> 01:36:52.547]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[01:36:52.547 --> 01:36:53.947]  Thank you for holding.
[01:36:53.947 --> 01:36:54.668]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:36:55.461 --> 01:36:56.882]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[01:36:56.882 --> 01:36:58.103]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[01:36:58.103 --> 01:36:58.823]  How are you?
[01:36:58.823 --> 01:36:59.623]  I love you, man.
[01:36:59.623 --> 01:37:01.945]  I want to make a quick plug.
[01:37:01.945 --> 01:37:03.826]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[01:37:03.826 --> 01:37:20.255]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which, according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[01:37:20.928 --> 01:37:26.350]  And it helped channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:39.835]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products and it was really only cost something like 50 bucks.
[01:37:39.835 --> 01:37:44.556]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[01:37:44.556 --> 01:37:45.997]  So thanks for the plug.
[01:37:51.983 --> 01:37:58.327]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy, or technocrats.
[01:37:58.327 --> 01:38:13.618]  You'll get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that they want businessmen technocrats over them.
[01:38:14.158 --> 01:38:15.398]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[01:38:15.398 --> 01:38:20.720]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.361]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[01:38:24.361 --> 01:38:29.883]  You see, he believes, because he's hidden in plain view, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[01:38:29.883 --> 01:38:31.983]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[01:38:31.983 --> 01:38:33.424]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[01:38:33.424 --> 01:38:37.945]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[01:38:37.945 --> 01:38:39.866]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism.
[01:38:39.866 --> 01:38:40.806]  It is what it works.
[01:38:41.446 --> 01:38:46.896]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines for sterilization before you take those shots.
[01:38:46.896 --> 01:38:49.260]  You might just want to find out who this villain is.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:49.561]  Alright?
[01:38:52.654 --> 01:39:03.622]  This message is not for our regular listeners who are informed and understand about the value of essential vitamins and minerals, meaning if you don't have them, you die long term.
[01:39:03.622 --> 01:39:05.163]  It's for new listeners.
[01:39:05.163 --> 01:39:09.126]  The power structure works around the clock to try to debilitate you and try to make you sickly.
[01:39:09.126 --> 01:39:11.468]  Please research, because this is life and death.
[01:39:12.168 --> 01:39:15.650]  Vitamins that are essential and minerals that are essential.
[01:39:15.650 --> 01:39:17.411]  Just type that into a search engine.
[01:39:17.411 --> 01:39:20.753]  You will see the top universities, CDC, all of them telling you this.
[01:39:20.753 --> 01:39:30.719]  But you won't see this on the nightly news because they don't want you at the big pharma companies to understand how to protect yourself to a great extent from what's going on in the world.
[01:39:30.859 --> 01:39:31.419]  We're good to go.

[01:40:12.877 --> 01:40:16.380]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:21.083]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[01:40:22.624 --> 01:40:23.024]  We're good.
[01:40:54.603 --> 01:40:57.192]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:25.162 --> 01:41:27.563]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:27.563 --> 01:41:31.766]  We changed lanes, but it's the same highway.
[01:41:31.766 --> 01:41:35.508]  You're hearing talk about President Trump lining up pardons.
[01:41:36.570 --> 01:41:41.912]  Whether or not that's fake news or what's really going on, we'll have to wait and see.
[01:41:41.912 --> 01:41:50.975]  But there is no doubt, an individual who deserves a pardon, perhaps more than anybody else, is Julian Assange.
[01:41:50.975 --> 01:41:54.376]  Now, the website is PardonAssange.com.
[01:41:55.590 --> 01:42:02.578]  And we'd love for Julian's people or whoever else to take control of this website if they would like.
[01:42:02.578 --> 01:42:08.565]  The hashtag is PardonAssangeNow and we need to get this message to President Trump now.
[01:42:10.521 --> 01:42:22.226]  A pardon of Julian Assange from the President is just another step for the President to say, look, I'm with you, the people, I'm not with the deep state, and I'm glad there's somebody out there exposing the fake wars.
[01:42:22.226 --> 01:42:28.749]  Now, Cassandra Varavans has been an intermediary between Julian Assange and the American press for some time.
[01:42:28.749 --> 01:42:33.131]  I'm not sure the last time they've spoke, but she joins us now to discuss this.
[01:42:33.131 --> 01:42:33.751]  Cassandra, what
[01:42:34.091 --> 01:42:37.713]  Are you hearing, if anything, about a potential pardon for Julian Assange?
[01:42:37.713 --> 01:42:42.316]  And how do we get this message to the president to try to spur this action?
[01:42:42.316 --> 01:42:56.105]  Hey, well, actually, you guys already donated a pardon Assange to the cause, and somebody created a tool which shows it goes through the last thousand or so people who have influenced Trump's Twitter feed.
[01:42:56.995 --> 01:43:00.219]  And you can use it to tweet directly at them.
[01:43:00.219 --> 01:43:08.186]  It'll show you 50 random people every time you reload who have either been in Trump's Twitter feed or have influenced things that he's retweeted.
[01:43:08.186 --> 01:43:12.331]  And if you could go use that and kindly request that they
[01:43:14.531 --> 01:43:20.774]  You know, send a message of support for Julian Assange and for pardoning him.
[01:43:20.774 --> 01:43:23.835]  That would be really helpful and really great.
[01:43:23.835 --> 01:43:24.916]  You know, it's funny.
[01:43:24.916 --> 01:43:33.840]  I remember when we first made PardonAssange.com, I went out for a week in Texas with a clipboard and we just did the old school paper technique.
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:41.806]  And I literally just got people to sign pieces of paper and I had to go in and put that all in the system to email out updates and stuff.
[01:43:41.806 --> 01:43:47.691]  But you're saying now people can go there and they can send a message, they can register for updates and stuff?
[01:43:47.691 --> 01:43:49.652]  Yeah, everything you need will be right there.
[01:43:49.652 --> 01:43:54.616]  You just click on the button and it'll show you 50 random people from the last 1,000.
[01:43:57.179 --> 01:43:58.880]  Who have, you know, influenced his feed.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:02.301]  And so those are people that we need to be tweeting support for Apartan.
[01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:06.762]  And if you could just nicely message them and say, hey, do you support Apartan for Julian?
[01:44:06.762 --> 01:44:08.923]  Could you maybe share it?
[01:44:08.923 --> 01:44:10.823]  Or whatever, whatever message you like.
[01:44:10.823 --> 01:44:13.024]  Just be nice.
[01:44:13.024 --> 01:44:15.705]  That could be a really big help for the cause.
[01:44:16.494 --> 01:44:19.016]  Make the case right now.
[01:44:19.016 --> 01:44:20.957]  You don't, I mean, we've got seven minutes here.
[01:44:20.957 --> 01:44:24.640]  You probably can make it concise, but you may go long here.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.783]  Make the case for Trump to pardon Julian Assange.
[01:44:28.783 --> 01:44:34.207]  Well, Julian Assange was not even the first person to publish the war logs that he's being charged for.
[01:44:34.207 --> 01:44:35.048]  They had already leaked.
[01:44:35.048 --> 01:44:36.569]  They were on Crypto.org.
[01:44:36.569 --> 01:44:38.070]  They were on Pirate Bay.
[01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:40.112]  Nobody has been charged besides him.
[01:44:40.112 --> 01:44:45.676]  How do you charge the third or fourth or fifth person who published something and not the first two?
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:49.381]  So, it's not fair on that front.
[01:44:49.381 --> 01:44:53.104]  It shows that it's clearly political.
[01:44:53.104 --> 01:45:04.051]  Also, there's people like Heritage Foundation who have been pushing these malicious lies that Julian got people killed with these publications.
[01:45:04.051 --> 01:45:05.252]  That's not true.
[01:45:05.252 --> 01:45:08.314]  The Pentagon has repeatedly said that that's not true.
[01:45:08.314 --> 01:45:10.296]  They said it during the Manning trial.
[01:45:10.296 --> 01:45:10.716]  The U.S.
[01:45:10.716 --> 01:45:14.939]  prosecutors during the extradition hearing said that it's not true.
[01:45:15.791 --> 01:45:18.413]  So, don't let the neocons push this lie.
[01:45:18.413 --> 01:45:20.635]  Combat it whenever you see it.
[01:45:20.635 --> 01:45:27.480]  Well, this is actually important because those claims that they're making about Assange could potentially be true, but not about Assange.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.222]  It's about Hillary Clinton.
[01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:33.906]  It's about the people that ran her State Department that released that information.
[01:45:33.906 --> 01:45:37.268]  I mean, there were people killed because private information got leaked.
[01:45:37.268 --> 01:45:38.489]  It wasn't Assange.
[01:45:38.489 --> 01:45:40.611]  It was people inside the Clinton State Department.
[01:45:41.718 --> 01:45:53.528]  Well, and the Clinton State Department, if you go over to Project Veritas, they had a video that just came out with 75 minutes of audio of Julian Assange making a phone call to the State Department.
[01:45:53.528 --> 01:45:58.692]  It was one of seven phone calls where he was like, hey, this stuff is about to get out of control.
[01:45:58.692 --> 01:46:04.817]  It's getting online because he had been going through and redacting everything for nine months and he was, you know, trying to release it in a
[01:46:06.144 --> 01:46:06.845]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:06.845 --> 01:46:12.909]  He believed that the information was important and people had a right to know it, but he also didn't want anybody to get killed over it.
[01:46:28.464 --> 01:46:30.847]  So they were going through trying to do it responsibly.
[01:46:30.847 --> 01:46:32.148]  It leaked online.
[01:46:32.148 --> 01:46:36.053]  He called Hillary Clinton's State Department and was like, Hey guys, we have a problem.
[01:46:36.053 --> 01:46:40.598]  You know, maybe we should work together to try to mitigate damage here.
[01:46:40.598 --> 01:46:41.379]  And they blew him off.
[01:46:41.379 --> 01:46:42.940]  They repeatedly blew him off.
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:45.924]  She had warnings just like, you know, with Benghazi, she blows off.
[01:46:47.186 --> 01:46:50.509]  Any warning that she gets, she's going to be careful.
[01:46:50.509 --> 01:47:09.947]  Now that I'm thinking about this, I mean I know that there was an internal problem with a WikiLeaks person that he was addressing in that phone call, but now I'm beginning to wonder, did, let me ask you this, do you believe that the Hillary Clinton State Department actually framed Julian Assange, intentionally putting that information out there to then blame Julian Assange?
[01:47:11.428 --> 01:47:11.928]  I don't know.
[01:47:11.928 --> 01:47:15.530]  I mean, I couldn't really speculate on that, but anything's possible.
[01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:17.211]  She's a terribly evil woman.
[01:47:17.211 --> 01:47:22.975]  I'm no fan, as you know.
[01:47:22.975 --> 01:47:24.055]  That wouldn't surprise me at all.
[01:47:24.055 --> 01:47:26.277]  I mean, that's the kind of operations that Hillary Clinton runs.
[01:47:26.277 --> 01:47:31.520]  I mean, like you said, this is a political evil genius, quite frankly.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.900]  I mean, I'll give her credit where credit's due.
[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:37.183]  She is an evil genius, politically, with some of the stuff that she's pulled off.
[01:47:38.407 --> 01:47:42.693]  What are you hearing from inside of DC, you know, with people that you're talking to?
[01:47:42.693 --> 01:47:47.860]  Is there pressure mounting in the White House to pardon Assange, or is it kind of just, you know, floating around?
[01:47:48.957 --> 01:47:50.658]  Um, it's about 50-50.
[01:47:50.658 --> 01:47:57.161]  There's a good amount of people in the White House who do support a pardon, and then there's a good amount of people who don't.
[01:47:57.161 --> 01:48:02.143]  And it kind of just depends on who ends up with Trump's ear, I think, at this point.
[01:48:02.143 --> 01:48:07.186]  Um, you know, I was hearing for a while that he was gonna do it, and then I heard that he wavered.
[01:48:07.186 --> 01:48:13.969]  Um, it's just been back and forth, and every source that I've talked to has heard different things.
[01:48:13.969 --> 01:48:17.451]  So we really don't know, and we really just gotta try and keep pressure up, I think.
[01:48:18.326 --> 01:48:25.253]  And make it clear that his supporters support this, and that it would be, you know, not political suicide to do it.
[01:48:25.253 --> 01:48:25.993]  Oh, not at all.
[01:48:25.993 --> 01:48:27.074]  It'd be the exact opposite.
[01:48:27.074 --> 01:48:34.481]  It'd be politically a slam dunk, in my opinion, and I think most fair intellectual observers here.
[01:48:34.481 --> 01:48:38.725]  But, you know, I can say one name for sure who's in Trump's ear telling him not to do this.
[01:48:40.087 --> 01:48:41.589]  And maybe they're similar people.
[01:48:41.589 --> 01:48:44.133]  What do you make of Lindsey Graham?
[01:48:44.133 --> 01:48:53.265]  I've stated my opinions on why I think Lindsey Graham is doing this, but why do you think Lindsey Graham is saying that Julian Assange is an evil person and should not be pardoned and belongs in jail?
[01:48:53.265 --> 01:48:56.410]  What do you make of Lindsey Graham doing that, who's certainly trying to influence the president there?
[01:48:57.782 --> 01:49:03.846]  Well, he's a neocon, and he's crooked, and he cares about the war lobby.
[01:49:03.846 --> 01:49:08.049]  You know, he likes his donations from the military-industrial complex.
[01:49:08.049 --> 01:49:11.291]  And he's never seen a bill for war he didn't sign.
[01:49:11.291 --> 01:49:14.073]  Yeah, there's no nation that he hasn't wanted to bomb, I'm sure.
[01:49:14.073 --> 01:49:16.335]  He's just like John McCain.
[01:49:16.335 --> 01:49:21.558]  And, you know, Wikileaks really, when they released the war logs, support for war went down.
[01:49:23.454 --> 01:49:24.717]  And they can't have that.
[01:49:24.717 --> 01:49:29.367]  That hurts their donors and their bottom line and their wallet.
[01:49:29.367 --> 01:49:32.374]  So they don't, you know, they don't want him free for that reason.
[01:49:33.254 --> 01:49:34.735]  Well, and Trump is a peace president.
[01:49:34.735 --> 01:49:36.895]  Trump is getting peace deals signed.
[01:49:36.895 --> 01:49:39.796]  He hasn't started any fake wars.
[01:49:39.796 --> 01:49:46.258]  The bombings that he has initiated, he's been very clear and transparent about what's going on with that.
[01:49:46.258 --> 01:49:51.960]  Whether you support it or not, there's been very little to no death in those bombings either.
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.121]  They've been very strategic.
[01:49:53.641 --> 01:50:03.629]  So I mean, this to me could be kind of a capstone, if you will, in President Trump as the anti-war peace president to say, here's an individual who exposed all the fake wars.
[01:50:03.629 --> 01:50:09.274]  Here's an individual who exposed all the criminals that got rich and perpetuated these fake wars.
[01:50:09.274 --> 01:50:18.402]  Now let's actually come together as an entire planet to stop the fighting, to stop the wars that enrich people in D.C.
[01:50:18.402 --> 01:50:19.062]  Absolutely.
[01:50:19.062 --> 01:50:22.445]  I think Trump has been great on it, and it really disappoints me that the left
[01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:28.580]  When after him so hard when I remember when I was on the left back in the day, we were protesting war.
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:34.009]  Now they're like, let's just stick some more war bongers in there and get rid of this great peace president.
[01:50:35.015 --> 01:50:41.838]  Well, it just shows how the left doesn't have any actual principles or ideals or foundation at all.
[01:50:41.838 --> 01:50:43.159]  They're just reactive.
[01:50:43.159 --> 01:50:44.239]  Oh, what is Trump like?
[01:50:44.239 --> 01:50:45.119]  I'm against it.
[01:50:45.119 --> 01:50:46.340]  Oh, what is a Trump supporter like?
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:46.980]  I'm against it.
[01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:54.443]  So sometimes they like war, sometimes they don't like war, sometimes they want to bomb, you know, millions of people in the Middle East under Obama, under Bush, they don't like it.
[01:50:54.443 --> 01:50:59.666]  And by the way, most of this stuff that Assange really exposed was from the Bush administration.
[01:50:59.666 --> 01:51:02.527]  So you know the neocons are in there trying to stop Trump from doing this.
[01:51:04.366 --> 01:51:05.607]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:05.607 --> 01:51:06.267]  And you know what?
[01:51:06.267 --> 01:51:20.676]  Another great thing that happened recently, Sarah Palin, back in the day, he released her emails, she compared him to the Taliban, and she's now put out a video calling for his pardon, saying that she was wrong, and that she had been misled, and that she had, you know, made a mistake.
[01:51:21.449 --> 01:51:25.710]  And I think we need more people to do that, and she's amazing for it.
[01:51:25.710 --> 01:51:27.710]  I highly recommend going and finding that video.
[01:51:27.710 --> 01:51:31.691]  It just shows that she's a real person, and people like Lindsey Graham are political hacks.
[01:51:31.691 --> 01:51:33.432]  Cassandra Fairbanks, thank you so much.
[01:51:33.432 --> 01:51:36.252]  The website, pardonassange.com.
[01:51:36.252 --> 01:51:40.513]  The hashtag, pardonassange now.
[01:51:40.513 --> 01:51:41.214]  The best product.
[01:51:41.214 --> 01:51:45.775]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[01:51:45.775 --> 01:51:47.115]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[01:51:48.527 --> 01:51:50.208]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[01:51:50.208 --> 01:51:51.889]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[01:51:51.889 --> 01:51:52.830]  That was a crazy week.
[01:51:52.830 --> 01:52:04.517]  I don't remember sleeping, but... As far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:05.818]  Nobody wakes up in the morning...
[01:52:07.301 --> 01:52:09.703]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[01:52:09.703 --> 01:52:11.084]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[01:52:11.084 --> 01:52:15.347]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[01:52:15.347 --> 01:52:17.568]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[01:52:17.568 --> 01:52:19.089]  I don't think that happens very often.
[01:52:19.089 --> 01:52:19.890]  It's never happened to me.
[01:52:19.890 --> 01:52:22.812]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[01:52:22.812 --> 01:52:24.513]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[01:52:24.653 --> 01:52:27.394]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[01:52:27.394 --> 01:52:35.376]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your health right now, and support the resistance.
[01:52:35.376 --> 01:52:38.697]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[01:52:38.697 --> 01:52:40.218]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[01:52:43.018 --> 01:52:46.460]  The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.562]  Chuckie Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[01:52:49.562 --> 01:52:53.905]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[01:52:53.905 --> 01:52:55.587]  Why do they love death?
[01:52:55.587 --> 01:52:58.569]  Because they hate themselves.
[01:52:58.569 --> 01:53:03.232]  They project their own disgust with their soul onto us.
[01:53:04.258 --> 01:53:09.402]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[01:53:09.402 --> 01:53:11.144]  That's why they hate InfoWars.
[01:53:11.144 --> 01:53:12.265]  We believe in humanity.
[01:53:12.265 --> 01:53:13.466]  We think you're beautiful.
[01:53:13.466 --> 01:53:15.107]  We think you're amazing.
[01:53:15.107 --> 01:53:20.531]  InfoWars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[01:53:20.531 --> 01:53:22.953]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[01:53:22.953 --> 01:53:24.174]  It's now upon us.
[01:53:24.174 --> 01:53:29.699]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about InfoWars now more than ever, when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[01:53:30.359 --> 01:53:31.920]  We know you're gonna override these globalists.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:33.001]  We know you're gonna defeat them.
[01:53:33.001 --> 01:53:36.022]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done.
[01:53:36.022 --> 01:53:44.126]  Because God's on our side, and the globalists know it.
[01:53:44.126 --> 01:53:46.768]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:05.342 --> 01:54:07.703]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:07.703 --> 01:54:10.524]  Theresistance.video is the new URL.
[01:54:10.524 --> 01:54:16.066]  Yeah, it won't be long before they start banning that too, but we'll play Whack-A-Mole and get another one.
[01:54:16.066 --> 01:54:20.207]  It's all possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com, by the way.
[01:54:20.207 --> 01:54:25.929]  And don't forget to get your vitamin D supplement, Winter Sun Plus, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:54:25.929 --> 01:54:29.671]  Back in stock, 50% off right now.
[01:54:29.671 --> 01:54:32.692]  I want to address something really quick here, and then when we come back for the
[01:54:34.801 --> 01:54:36.022]  Most of this hour.
[01:54:36.022 --> 01:54:39.143]  I'm going to cover the other news here.
[01:54:39.143 --> 01:54:48.507]  And then we've got important videos and reports coming up from Alex Jones as well at the end of this hour and into the next hour with Jon Rappaport.
[01:54:48.507 --> 01:54:51.128]  But look, I don't know what it is.
[01:54:51.128 --> 01:54:53.809]  It's honestly kind of weird.
[01:54:53.809 --> 01:54:55.430]  To be frank, because
[01:54:57.108 --> 01:55:03.155]  I mean, we don't go out and hire billionaires.
[01:55:03.155 --> 01:55:05.737]  We don't go out and hire valedictorians.
[01:55:05.737 --> 01:55:07.780]  I mean, there's no elitism here.
[01:55:09.682 --> 01:55:17.425]  I don't know how to explain it, but it's weird to literally be the best news team out there.
[01:55:17.425 --> 01:55:18.285]  I don't know how to say that.
[01:55:18.285 --> 01:55:21.226]  And it's because we don't like, it's not about bragging or anything.
[01:55:21.226 --> 01:55:22.947]  It's just, it's true.
[01:55:22.947 --> 01:55:27.308]  Our analysis is by far beyond anyone else's out there.
[01:55:27.308 --> 01:55:28.949]  And that's not an insult to other people.
[01:55:28.949 --> 01:55:29.569]  It's just the truth.
[01:55:30.129 --> 01:55:32.190]  And that's just because we have the courage to go with our gut.
[01:55:32.190 --> 01:55:37.772]  We have the courage to say what everybody's thinking, and we don't filter ourselves, we don't censor ourselves.
[01:55:37.772 --> 01:55:44.394]  It's from the soul, it's from the spirit, and then right out, onto the airwaves.
[01:55:44.394 --> 01:55:52.417]  So, when I saw last week, and I mean, part of my crew is in here, they work on the Alex Jones Show too, they'll probably remember when I was addressing this.
[01:55:52.417 --> 01:55:59.040]  When I saw last week, the big cyber security attack, cyber security hack, oh my gosh, it's the worst thing ever.
[01:56:00.876 --> 01:56:11.138]  And I saw the presentation, and I saw the parties that be freaking out about it, and I saw the twisting and the manipulation, it was just instinctual, okay, this is fake news.
[01:56:12.641 --> 01:56:15.145]  This is being used to attack Donald Trump.
[01:56:15.145 --> 01:56:18.028]  This is being used to make Trump look incompetent.
[01:56:18.028 --> 01:56:24.216]  And this is being used as an alley-oop to Joe Biden to come in and say, see, Trump-Russia again.
[01:56:24.216 --> 01:56:25.718]  Oh, it's happening again.
[01:56:25.718 --> 01:56:26.599]  We need to stop it.
[01:56:26.599 --> 01:56:27.420]  Trump's incompetent.
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:28.421]  He can't figure anything out.
[01:56:28.421 --> 01:56:30.284]  Look, a massive cyber attack.
[01:56:30.284 --> 01:56:30.965]  The worst thing ever.
[01:56:32.383 --> 01:56:37.524]  So then Trump came out, I believe it was on Monday or Tuesday, and maybe the crew can find the tweet.
[01:56:37.524 --> 01:56:40.365]  He's tweeting hundreds of times a day, so they may not be able to find it.
[01:56:40.365 --> 01:56:47.987]  But Trump came out and put out in a tweet, in a statement, and he said, look, the cyber attack you're hearing about all over the news, you know, Fox News building it up too.
[01:56:47.987 --> 01:56:53.048]  Fox News is now on their anti-Trump stage, just like we told you that was coming.
[01:56:53.048 --> 01:56:54.148]  Again, next year's news today.
[01:56:55.424 --> 01:57:04.852]  So Trump puts out a statement saying, the cyber attack is being overblown, it's not as bad, the whole thing's under control, it's being hyped up to make me look bad.
[01:57:04.852 --> 01:57:07.434]  Just like I said it was.
[01:57:07.434 --> 01:57:24.148]  And now, the completion, the completion of the hoax, the completion of the fake news, the alley-oop dunk for Biden has now been finalized, and Biden puts out a statement, and by the way, Joe Biden's statements in the videos, and guys you can just play the video, just the B-roll,
[01:57:25.663 --> 01:57:26.848]  The guy's weak.
[01:57:26.848 --> 01:57:27.752]  He's frail.
[01:57:27.752 --> 01:57:28.836]  He's pale in the face.
[01:57:28.836 --> 01:57:29.841]  I mean, seriously.
[01:57:31.776 --> 01:57:37.418]  If you've ever experienced a loved one dying of cancer in their old age, that's what he looks like.
[01:57:37.418 --> 01:57:40.419]  He looks like he's on his deathbed.
[01:57:40.419 --> 01:57:44.721]  But they powder his face and put a suit on him and put him in front of a camera and he reads off a teleprompter.
[01:57:44.721 --> 01:57:47.242]  He doesn't know what he's saying, he doesn't know where he is.
[01:57:47.242 --> 01:57:50.203]  Folks, he's literally on the steps of death.
[01:57:50.203 --> 01:58:00.667]  But that's the agenda, is to give you the weakest leader possible from China, and then hopefully he just goes away and then Harris comes in and just makes you into a communist country.
[01:58:01.667 --> 01:58:07.570]  Biden makes a statement and says, the cyber security attack happened on Donald Trump's watch.
[01:58:07.570 --> 01:58:14.853]  So he sits there, blames Donald Trump, and then says, but rest assured that even if he does not take it seriously, I will.
[01:58:14.853 --> 01:58:17.194]  So no, it's not that Trump didn't take it seriously.
[01:58:17.194 --> 01:58:19.435]  He told you it's more fake news.
[01:58:19.435 --> 01:58:20.296]  Yeah, there's the tweet from Trump.
[01:58:20.296 --> 01:58:23.277]  The cyber attack is far greater in the fake news media than in actuality.
[01:58:23.277 --> 01:58:25.518]  I've been fully briefed and everything is well under control.
[01:58:25.518 --> 01:58:27.239]  Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant.
[01:58:27.719 --> 01:58:40.767]  When anything happens because lamestream is, for the most, mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China, it may, there could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election.
[01:58:40.767 --> 01:58:47.691]  So Trump says, hey, this cyber attack is something they're lying about, but the real cyber attack was on our election systems on election night.
[01:58:49.858 --> 01:58:52.919]  Winter Sun has been sold out for months.
[01:58:52.919 --> 01:58:53.980]  It's now back in stock.
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:57.481]  It's the highest quality vitamin D3 you're going to find anywhere.
[01:58:57.481 --> 01:59:02.784]  You take it under the tongue for maximum absorption or just put it in your mouth and drink it down.
[01:59:02.784 --> 01:59:08.106]  It's absolutely an essential vitamin, meaning if you don't have it and you have a deficiency from it, you will die.
[01:59:08.686 --> 01:59:10.147]  The system doesn't want you to know this.
[01:59:10.147 --> 01:59:17.492]  And they don't want you to know that they've lowered the allowance of what they claim you need every day to a level that makes you very, very sickly and easy to control.
[01:59:17.492 --> 01:59:21.535]  But now we have a winner's sum of vitamin D3 and vitamin K that helps it upload better.
[01:59:21.535 --> 01:59:25.378]  And it's also excellent for your immune system at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:25.378 --> 01:59:26.159]  Sold out for months.
[01:59:26.679 --> 01:59:31.101]  I'm still gonna sell it at 50% off, because everyone needs it.
[01:59:31.101 --> 01:59:37.605]  Get it for yourself, get it for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors, especially folks that work indoors and don't get any sun.
[01:59:37.605 --> 01:59:42.407]  It's absolutely critical to get your Winter Sun, now available again, at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:59:42.407 --> 01:59:46.609]  Again, Winter Sun at InfoWareStore.com is back in stock.
[01:59:46.609 --> 01:59:48.911]  Merry Christmas!
[02:00:04.386 --> 02:00:06.687]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:06.687 --> 02:00:10.028]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.028 --> 02:00:13.249]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:00:13.249 --> 02:00:16.209]  Still with you in the captain's chair.
[02:00:16.209 --> 02:00:22.651]  We do have a couple emergency reports coming up from Alex Jones shortly.
[02:00:22.651 --> 02:00:24.852]  And John Rappaport hosting the fourth hour.
[02:00:24.852 --> 02:00:24.992]  And...
[02:00:26.454 --> 02:00:29.998]  A statement from President Trump that you may not have seen yet.
[02:00:29.998 --> 02:00:30.819]  Very important.
[02:00:30.819 --> 02:00:32.881]  We're going to air that as well.
[02:00:32.881 --> 02:00:38.788]  I'm going to do some news coverage here in the next two segments just so you can see the full waterfront of what's going on.
[02:00:38.788 --> 02:00:39.609]  Before I do that...
[02:00:40.583 --> 02:00:59.279]  It is imperative, ladies and gentlemen, for your health, for your immune system to be sufficient in vitamin D. Now, I'm not going to get into all the science about vitamin D, but I can put it pretty flatly here using current events to explain how important it is.
[02:01:00.339 --> 02:01:04.661]  Yes, we know the whole COVID thing is an overblown hoax, there's no pandemic.
[02:01:04.661 --> 02:01:22.928]  But, they're even admitting, in the actual COVID deaths, not the people that get shot and they say are from COVID, not the 96-year-olds that die of old age and they say is of COVID, not the people that get run over by cars and they say has died of COVID, which is about half of the COVID deaths probably, but it's really people that die of the flu and they just say it's COVID.
[02:01:22.928 --> 02:01:28.190]  So, they admit though, in the actual flu deaths, which they claim is COVID,
[02:01:29.850 --> 02:01:46.096]  They have 80% of those individuals that died from the flu, or renamed, rebranded as COVID, they're deficient in vitamin C, or excuse me, vitamin D. Probably vitamin C too, but vitamin D in the winter is key because you're not getting as much sun.
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:51.461]  And that's one of the main sources to get the vitamin D. That's why they have the orange juice.
[02:01:51.461 --> 02:01:53.061]  They call it Sunny D and all of this stuff.
[02:01:53.061 --> 02:01:57.742]  It's the vitamin D. It's essential for your immune system to stay healthy in the winter.
[02:01:57.742 --> 02:02:02.823]  That's why we have Winter Sun Plus at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:02:02.823 --> 02:02:07.884]  Now this is the premier vitamin D supplement right here.
[02:02:07.884 --> 02:02:08.784]  Winter Sun Plus.
[02:02:08.784 --> 02:02:11.245]  The premier vitamin D supplement.
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:18.904]  We sold out of Wintersun Plus very quickly, our last run of it.
[02:02:18.904 --> 02:02:29.110]  So I mean, if we were just straight business people and that was our number one priority, we wouldn't be selling this to you at 50% off.
[02:02:29.110 --> 02:02:33.593]  But see, it's the same reason why I only plugged once last hour and I'm bad because of that.
[02:02:33.593 --> 02:02:37.156]  We're more intent on getting you the information here.
[02:02:37.156 --> 02:02:41.719]  We're more intent in just being on air than actually making money.
[02:02:42.813 --> 02:02:46.674]  So maybe that's kind of a downside of us here, but it's the ultimate priority.
[02:02:46.674 --> 02:02:52.557]  So, Wintersun Plus, back in stock, 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:02:52.557 --> 02:02:54.497]  Folks, this is a no-brainer.
[02:02:54.497 --> 02:02:57.078]  Order yourself Wintersun Plus from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:02:57.078 --> 02:03:00.460]  Get two, get three, get ten bottles right now while it's in stock.
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:01.780]  Give them to your family and friends.
[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:03.641]  Make sure you're stocked up for winter.
[02:03:03.641 --> 02:03:05.461]  It's Wintersun Plus.
[02:03:05.461 --> 02:03:11.944]  It's exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com, and it is the Premier Vitamin D Supplement.
[02:03:13.061 --> 02:03:15.403]  Okay.
[02:03:15.403 --> 02:03:18.907]  Let me start to pile drive into this news.
[02:03:18.907 --> 02:03:21.930]  Let me just pick it up right here, right now.
[02:03:21.930 --> 02:03:24.573]  Headline from the Gateway Pundit.
[02:03:24.573 --> 02:03:28.076]  Liberal Democrats support Trump's plan to increase payments to $2,000.
[02:03:28.076 --> 02:03:35.704]  Now I'm beginning to wonder if this wasn't a bait and switch from the Democrats because you had all these Democrat frauds and commies
[02:03:37.065 --> 02:03:45.750]  Like Cortez, Alexandra Cortez, who said, oh, this, this stimulus bill is ridiculous.
[02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:46.651]  I can't believe it.
[02:03:46.651 --> 02:03:50.993]  Only 600 for people and then all this billions for all these foreign countries.
[02:03:50.993 --> 02:03:52.094]  I won't sign it.
[02:03:52.094 --> 02:03:53.695]  And then that fraud signed the bill.
[02:03:53.695 --> 02:03:55.015]  I mean, AOC is a total fraud.
[02:03:55.015 --> 02:03:55.456]  You know this.
[02:03:55.456 --> 02:03:58.517]  So she signed the bill.
[02:03:58.517 --> 02:03:59.418]  Even though she said it was bad.
[02:04:00.549 --> 02:04:03.970]  And then Pelosi signed the bill and all the Democrats signed the bill except Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:04:03.970 --> 02:04:11.932]  But now they all come out in unison today and they say, well, we the Democrats demand 2,000 indirect payments.
[02:04:11.932 --> 02:04:13.313]  Do you realize how big of a joke it is?
[02:04:13.313 --> 02:04:15.133]  I'm telling you, this is so fake.
[02:04:15.133 --> 02:04:16.794]  Pelosi wrote the damn bill.
[02:04:17.825 --> 02:04:25.709]  If she wanted the $2,000 in there for the American people, she would have put it in there, and Mitch McConnell is just a total cuck.
[02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:40.157]  So, I mean, Pelosi basically cucks Mitch McConnell in these meetings, writes the bill, gives you $600, so that they can come around and then act like they're the heroes and say, oh, never mind, we'll give you $2,000.
[02:04:40.157 --> 02:04:42.919]  It's a bait-and-switch, it's a setup, and by the way,
[02:04:44.286 --> 02:05:00.877]  Of the $900 billion that they put in that fake stimulus bill, which is to stimulate the world economy and rob you blind, if they would have instead just divided that, just the original $900 billion, every American would have received $2,700.
[02:05:00.877 --> 02:05:02.718]  So, this is still not even the full amount.
[02:05:07.802 --> 02:05:14.627]  And all they're gonna do is they're proposing to bring it up to a trillion dollars so that they can give you some Trump change.
[02:05:14.627 --> 02:05:18.029]  Now remember, I forget the actual number.
[02:05:18.029 --> 02:05:20.972]  It may have been $2,000.
[02:05:20.972 --> 02:05:33.261]  President Trump gave the American people a tax cut and it equaled $2,000 per household.
[02:05:33.261 --> 02:05:33.501]  Okay?
[02:05:33.501 --> 02:05:34.602]  It's a tax cut.
[02:05:35.583 --> 02:05:47.668]  Everybody used to want to get their taxes cut, but now the Democrat Party is Chinese Communists, and any liberal progressive is just a brainwashed Stockholm Syndrome foot soldier that just does whatever they're told to do, or do the opposite of what Trump does.
[02:05:47.668 --> 02:05:49.669]  Trump says cancer is bad, they say they love cancer.
[02:05:50.461 --> 02:05:53.603]  So Trump says, oh, look, $2,000 return.
[02:05:53.603 --> 02:05:54.603]  We're cutting your taxes.
[02:05:54.603 --> 02:05:55.744]  Here's $2,000.
[02:05:55.744 --> 02:05:56.444]  Good for you.
[02:05:56.444 --> 02:05:59.286]  Pelosi says, oh, that's breadcrumbs.
[02:05:59.286 --> 02:06:01.787]  How dare he insult you with $2,000?
[02:06:01.787 --> 02:06:08.091]  And then she comes around and says, look, I'm giving you $2,000 in COVID relief.
[02:06:08.091 --> 02:06:09.331]  I'm a hero.
[02:06:09.331 --> 02:06:10.192]  You're a fraud.
[02:06:10.192 --> 02:06:11.012]  You're a liar.
[02:06:11.012 --> 02:06:11.733]  And you're a witch.
[02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:14.373]  Nancy Pelosi.
[02:06:14.373 --> 02:06:19.843]  But see, Mitch McConnell's such a cuck, he just sits in there with Pelosi and lets her write the whole bill.
[02:06:19.843 --> 02:06:22.428]  By the way, Trump said he's gonna veto this bill.
[02:06:23.661 --> 02:06:25.562]  And I just want to correct a statement I made earlier.
[02:06:25.562 --> 02:06:27.904]  The Insurrection Act was not mentioned in the stimulus bill.
[02:06:27.904 --> 02:06:36.769]  It was mentioned in the most recent NDAA Authorization Act, National Defense Authorization Act, that I believe Trump will veto, too.
[02:06:36.769 --> 02:06:39.551]  So Trump said he's going to veto the original stimulus bill.
[02:06:39.551 --> 02:06:41.612]  Now the Democrats are acting like heroes.
[02:06:41.612 --> 02:06:43.433]  Oh, we'll give you $2,000.
[02:06:43.433 --> 02:06:46.495]  You could have done that the first time, Pelosi, you liar.
[02:06:46.495 --> 02:06:47.996]  So it's just a proof they set this up.
[02:06:47.996 --> 02:06:49.697]  So the Democrats are actually great at this.
[02:06:49.697 --> 02:06:50.878]  They alley-oop each other.
[02:06:51.238 --> 02:06:53.199]  They alley-oop each other with fake news.
[02:06:53.199 --> 02:06:56.141]  They alley-oop each other with these bills that they don't actually want.
[02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:58.182]  They just want to alley-oop to the next bill.
[02:06:58.182 --> 02:06:58.982]  So that's what they did.
[02:06:58.982 --> 02:07:02.344]  That's what they did with the cybersecurity hack, blaming Russia.
[02:07:02.344 --> 02:07:06.866]  They alley-ooped it so Biden can come in and say, see, Trump's bad, but I'll stop it.
[02:07:06.866 --> 02:07:11.729]  And now they've done it with this COVID stimulus, where they say, oh, here's the bill, $900 billion, and you get $6.
[02:07:14.571 --> 02:07:17.252]  And then they say, oh, wait a second, this is no good.
[02:07:17.252 --> 02:07:18.672]  You get $2,000.
[02:07:18.672 --> 02:07:19.413]  See, we love you.
[02:07:19.413 --> 02:07:20.153]  We're the heroes.
[02:07:20.153 --> 02:07:21.793]  No, you're spitting in our eye.
[02:07:21.793 --> 02:07:22.934]  Here's an idea.
[02:07:22.934 --> 02:07:24.394]  Open up the economy.
[02:07:24.394 --> 02:07:25.515]  We don't need stimulus.
[02:07:25.515 --> 02:07:26.915]  We don't want your stimulus.
[02:07:26.915 --> 02:07:28.656]  We want a free country.
[02:07:28.656 --> 02:07:32.837]  We want to be able to go back to work and school and church.
[02:07:32.837 --> 02:07:35.098]  But see, the CHICOMS run the Democrat Party.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:43.127]  They run the media, and so they have an illegal shutdown over a fake pandemic.
[02:07:43.127 --> 02:07:46.410]  Now, I know you know this, so let's just move on.
[02:07:46.410 --> 02:07:50.794]  Mitch McConnell, this guy, what dirt do they have on Mitch McConnell?
[02:07:50.794 --> 02:07:51.515]  I'm beginning to wonder.
[02:07:51.515 --> 02:07:55.078]  I mean, do you really think it's that far-fetched, folks?
[02:07:55.078 --> 02:08:00.543]  Everything you do is documented on the internet.
[02:08:00.543 --> 02:08:01.004]  Everything.
[02:08:03.499 --> 02:08:08.521]  You cheat on your wife once, the Chinese Communists know it, Silicon Valley knows it.
[02:08:08.521 --> 02:08:10.361]  Apple knows it, Google knows it.
[02:08:10.361 --> 02:08:12.882]  You don't think that that could be used as blackmail?
[02:08:12.882 --> 02:08:22.285]  Or maybe, you know, you're married and maybe you hang out at the bathhouses with Bubble Boy Rubio and you like to dabble in that department.
[02:08:22.285 --> 02:08:26.486]  China knows it, Google knows it, Silicon Valley knows it, Apple knows it, boom, you get blackmailed like that.
[02:08:26.486 --> 02:08:28.147]  So, I mean, it's not that far-fetched.
[02:08:28.147 --> 02:08:29.447]  And now Mitch McConnell
[02:08:31.383 --> 02:08:39.490]  Says that they're going to return to Congress on December 29th to override Trump's veto of the stimulus bill.
[02:08:39.490 --> 02:08:43.673]  So Mitch McConnell is a traitor.
[02:08:43.673 --> 02:08:54.782]  Mitch McConnell wants to give $800 billion to foreign countries and call it a COVID relief bill for you.
[02:08:56.442 --> 02:09:01.725]  This is the most insulting thing perhaps Congress has ever done to us, and that is saying a lot.
[02:09:01.725 --> 02:09:15.634]  To do this right in front of our faces, to say, here's your COVID relief, America, and then give you Trump change, and give every other country in the world that has a phone to call billions of dollars.
[02:09:15.634 --> 02:09:25.561]  It's criminal, and the fact that Mitch McConnell now wants to override the veto of this tells you he's corrupt, he's bought and paid for, maybe it's his wife Elaine Chao,
[02:09:26.684 --> 02:09:28.686]  Maybe Mitch McConnell just cucks to his wife, too.
[02:09:28.686 --> 02:09:30.267]  In fact, no.
[02:09:30.267 --> 02:09:33.910]  Mitch McConnell is the wife of Elaine Chao.
[02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:36.152]  Elaine Chao wears the pants in that relationship.
[02:09:36.152 --> 02:09:38.715]  She obviously dominates Cuck McConnell.
[02:09:38.715 --> 02:09:44.740]  And so Mitch Cuck McConnell wants to give $800 billion to foreign countries, and he wants to give you $600.
[02:09:46.141 --> 02:09:48.362]  Mitch McConnell, you suck.

[02:11:43.915 --> 02:11:45.536]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[02:11:51.698 --> 02:11:54.283]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:03.846 --> 02:12:06.687]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:12:06.687 --> 02:12:12.568]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:12.568 --> 02:12:15.809]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:12:15.809 --> 02:12:18.229]  We've got breaking news coming up from Alex Jones.
[02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:24.091]  We've also got a very important message that most people probably haven't seen yet from President Trump.
[02:12:24.091 --> 02:12:28.292]  It's kind of hiding in plain sight, but with all the censorship and fake television news, they won't show it.
[02:12:28.292 --> 02:12:30.252]  We're going to air it here on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:30.252 --> 02:12:33.213]  I'm going to do a brief news blitz, but, you know, let me just address something first.
[02:12:35.249 --> 02:12:45.697]  Two days ago I hosted the show, and if you were listening, I was really hot and bothered, and I was talking about what was going on at the Oregon Capitol Building in Salem, and I was supportive of their activity.
[02:12:45.697 --> 02:12:47.238]  Now, I'm honest.
[02:12:47.238 --> 02:12:49.700]  If I get something wrong, I'll come in and correct the record.
[02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:51.501]  We have nothing to hide here.
[02:12:51.501 --> 02:12:52.722]  I was wrong about one thing.
[02:12:52.722 --> 02:12:55.804]  There was property damage done to the Capitol Building that day.
[02:12:55.804 --> 02:12:58.947]  A couple of the doors in the front were kicked in.
[02:12:58.947 --> 02:13:00.628]  Probably a couple hundred dollars worth of damage.
[02:13:00.948 --> 02:13:06.239]  The individual that did that should step up and come forward and pay for that and apologize.
[02:13:06.239 --> 02:13:07.261]  Now having said that...
[02:13:08.798 --> 02:13:18.702]  All I am saying is that this is inevitable when they're literally stealing our money, shutting down our economy, stealing our elections.
[02:13:18.702 --> 02:13:22.663]  So what do you expect Americans to do when you've stolen everything from them?
[02:13:22.663 --> 02:13:25.124]  Their money, their elections, their integrity.
[02:13:25.124 --> 02:13:29.966]  Of course people are going to start going to Capitol buildings and having rallies.
[02:13:29.966 --> 02:13:31.386]  I don't want to become violent.
[02:13:31.386 --> 02:13:32.887]  I'm not a violent revolutionary.
[02:13:32.887 --> 02:13:33.687]  I'm a peaceful guy.
[02:13:34.738 --> 02:13:41.444]  But I'm also not going to sit here and say these people are bad when everything is being stolen from them.
[02:13:41.444 --> 02:13:42.245]  But here's the catch.
[02:13:43.751 --> 02:13:57.595]  The real reason why I got so upset about this, again, if you're a Soros protester, under the moniker of Black Lives Matter, or Antifa, or the Women's March, all these other things that he owns, you're allowed to do anything you want!
[02:13:57.595 --> 02:14:01.396]  You can riot, you can rob, you can murder, literally!
[02:14:01.396 --> 02:14:02.516]  They've gotten away with all of it!
[02:14:02.516 --> 02:14:08.278]  They just had a Black Lives Matter protester run over a guy in the streets, they dropped the charges.
[02:14:08.278 --> 02:14:09.198]  That's attempted murder!
[02:14:09.938 --> 02:14:11.519]  But only if you're a Trump supporter.
[02:14:11.519 --> 02:14:14.501]  If you're a Soros protester, you can get away with anything.
[02:14:14.501 --> 02:14:25.108]  So, that's my rub here, is that I'm sick of the left and the Soros protests having all the rights, but if you have an American flag or a Trump flag, you have no rights, and police attack you.
[02:14:25.108 --> 02:14:35.155]  So, I didn't mean to attack the police, and quite frankly, it's not something that I regret, it's just, we speak from the heart here.
[02:14:36.067 --> 02:14:37.769]  There's no teleprompters.
[02:14:37.769 --> 02:14:39.011]  There's no self-censorship.
[02:14:39.011 --> 02:14:45.159]  So yeah, there's times where I'm going to say something that maybe I could have walked back a little bit or shouldn't go on to the extreme, but there's no regrets here.
[02:14:45.159 --> 02:14:45.740]  We do what it is.
[02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:47.462]  Now, I have to give credit though.
[02:14:47.462 --> 02:14:50.105]  Media Matters puts out a story.
[02:14:51.052 --> 02:14:57.977]  With the headline, InfoWars host praises violent attempted takeover of Oregon Statehouse, rails at police for intervening.
[02:14:57.977 --> 02:15:06.083]  Now, I must say, Timothy Johnson, who loves following everything I do, this is the best story you've ever written, Timothy, so congratulations.
[02:15:06.083 --> 02:15:07.204]  It's a great story, actually.
[02:15:07.204 --> 02:15:07.725]  Very well done.
[02:15:08.485 --> 02:15:11.448]  And whoever John Whitehouse is, probably a fake name, he seems to be new.
[02:15:11.448 --> 02:15:15.151]  And then I love research contributions from Brendan Carrot and Andrew Lawrence.
[02:15:15.151 --> 02:15:16.292]  What research?
[02:15:16.292 --> 02:15:20.475]  All they do is publish the transcript of everything I said in that segment.
[02:15:20.475 --> 02:15:22.477]  Which, again, I'm dead serious.
[02:15:22.477 --> 02:15:25.859]  Timothy, we'll pay for your transcript, writers.
[02:15:25.859 --> 02:15:33.946]  We'd love to get the transcript, so if you could just send us whoever does the transcript of all of our broadcasts that you guys put on your website, Media Matters, we would love that.
[02:15:33.946 --> 02:15:35.067]  We'd love those transcribers.
[02:15:36.547 --> 02:15:37.727]  Here's the irony.
[02:15:37.727 --> 02:15:40.548]  Yeah, you take one look at that guy, what do you think he does at night?
[02:15:40.548 --> 02:15:43.208]  Here's the irony.
[02:15:43.208 --> 02:15:47.649]  InfoWars host praises violent attempted takeover of Oregon Statehouse.
[02:15:47.649 --> 02:16:01.852]  This entire year, mainstream media has praised, perpetuated, and instigated the biggest riots, the most violent riots, and the most expensive riots we've ever seen in our country.
[02:16:02.796 --> 02:16:05.297]  George Floyd, you name it.
[02:16:05.297 --> 02:16:08.098]  All summer, more than $2 billion of property damage.
[02:16:08.098 --> 02:16:09.798]  That's more than ever at any riot.
[02:16:09.798 --> 02:16:11.138]  That's all the mainstream media.
[02:16:11.138 --> 02:16:12.239]  That's all they do.
[02:16:12.239 --> 02:16:14.599]  That was their baby.
[02:16:14.599 --> 02:16:21.181]  But then they're mad at me for saying, hey, I appreciate what was, for the most part, an actual peaceful thing.
[02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:22.782]  I admit that there was property damage now.
[02:16:23.581 --> 02:16:26.503]  But other than that, there was no property damage and nobody harmed.
[02:16:26.503 --> 02:16:28.305]  So that's peaceful.
[02:16:28.305 --> 02:16:29.466]  That's beyond peaceful.
[02:16:29.466 --> 02:16:35.471]  That's like angelic in comparison to the Soros protests, to the Democrat riots.
[02:16:35.471 --> 02:16:38.994]  So they're mad at, again, it just shows the irony, but then it's even funnier.
[02:16:40.285 --> 02:16:44.166]  They're mad that I'm railing against the police, as they say.
[02:16:44.166 --> 02:16:49.147]  Which, I talked to police after this, they're like, yeah, you're kind of right, but you know, you have to understand there's bad eggs everywhere.
[02:16:49.147 --> 02:16:49.887]  Okay?
[02:16:49.887 --> 02:16:51.147]  So, think about this.
[02:16:51.147 --> 02:17:06.110]  The mainstream media that hates the police, and that just caused the largest riots in the history of our country, are now mad at me because I said, hey, this is a nice protest, and the police are in the wrong.
[02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:07.531]  Think about that irony.
[02:17:07.531 --> 02:17:08.811]  Again, it's total proof
[02:17:09.511 --> 02:17:16.514]  That the modern day left in America has no ideology, no principles, no values, no foundation.
[02:17:16.514 --> 02:17:18.995]  Honestly, I'm like, it's like, everything's so crazy.
[02:17:18.995 --> 02:17:20.896]  Maybe these are literally clones or something.
[02:17:20.896 --> 02:17:24.098]  That literally can't think, but they're programmed.
[02:17:24.098 --> 02:17:25.018]  It's that wild.
[02:17:25.018 --> 02:17:27.279]  So, I just think that's hilarious.
[02:17:27.279 --> 02:17:34.422]  You guys are the most hypocritical, ironic people in the history of mankind, and it's funny to me that you don't even realize that.
[02:17:34.422 --> 02:17:37.144]  But, when you look like Timothy Johnson, maybe it makes sense.
[02:17:38.308 --> 02:17:39.389]  This is crazy.
[02:17:39.389 --> 02:17:47.133]  So Fox News's ratings are collapsing, Newsmax's ratings are on the rise, and part of the reasons for that is Chris Wallace.
[02:17:47.133 --> 02:17:49.014]  Now, you tell me.
[02:17:49.014 --> 02:17:56.419]  Did Chris Wallace go on 60 Minutes in drag, pretending to be a Pfizer executive?
[02:17:56.419 --> 02:17:57.760]  Okay?
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:03.443]  I'm not trying to get too conspiratorial here, but what the hell, man?
[02:18:03.443 --> 02:18:07.085]  Tell me that's not Chris Wallace in drag!
[02:18:07.085 --> 02:18:07.426]  Okay.
[02:18:08.483 --> 02:18:10.525]  Oh my gosh, yes, I'm Chris Wallace.
[02:18:10.525 --> 02:18:13.066]  Or, I mean, I'm Betty Lou from Pfizer today.
[02:18:13.066 --> 02:18:22.433]  Uh, boy, that's... It's either really funny or like the craziest thing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:18:22.433 --> 02:18:23.754]  Chris Wallace in drag.
[02:18:23.754 --> 02:18:27.837]  60 minutes pretending to be a Pfizer executive.
[02:18:27.837 --> 02:18:29.158]  Alright.
[02:18:29.158 --> 02:18:29.558]  Oh, man.
[02:18:30.786 --> 02:18:36.368]  Oh, we've got the mutant COVID now in the United Kingdom, the mutant COVID.
[02:18:36.368 --> 02:18:41.469]  So COVID isn't making you scared enough, so now it's the muta... it's a mutant COVID, oh!
[02:18:41.469 --> 02:18:52.632]  And by the way, the mutant COVID now means that your COVID vaccine is totally irrelevant and won't stop COVID, so just total fraud, but they assume the average person is so stupid they won't put two and two together.
[02:18:55.096 --> 02:19:01.783]  Newt Gingrich writes a powerful op-ed warning America headed for a serious bitter struggle amid voter fraud controversy.
[02:19:01.783 --> 02:19:03.745]  Yeah, they were caught stealing our election.
[02:19:03.745 --> 02:19:10.511]  President Trump tweets gateway pundit video showing poll workers stuffing ballots into tabulators numerous times on election nights.
[02:19:10.511 --> 02:19:12.553]  You have eyewitness accounts that confirm that.
[02:19:13.496 --> 02:19:18.562]  By the way, a live stream, I think it's happening right now, Georgia House of Representatives hold hearing on election fraud.
[02:19:18.562 --> 02:19:21.625]  Thank God for right-side broadcasting, otherwise nobody would ever air it.
[02:19:21.625 --> 02:19:22.647]  And YouTube would censor it.
[02:19:22.647 --> 02:19:26.791]  YouTube removes video of Trump's lawyer's opening statement at Senate Committee hearing.
[02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:29.194]  We've published that at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:30.035 --> 02:19:34.239]  Anti-Trump Georgian election official catches woman trying to vote illegally using his home address.
[02:19:34.239 --> 02:19:35.200]  And this is one of the funniest things.
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:40.524]  So this guy hates Trump, but he caught people illegally voting from his address and I guess using his identity.
[02:19:40.524 --> 02:19:43.187]  And he's like, well, you know, he's kind of like sloughing it off.
[02:19:43.187 --> 02:19:45.289]  Like, well, I guess what she did was illegal.
[02:19:45.289 --> 02:19:47.310]  Uh, no, it's definitely illegal.
[02:19:47.310 --> 02:19:48.491]  He just hates Trump so much.
[02:19:48.491 --> 02:19:50.013]  He won't admit, well, maybe it was a mistake.
[02:19:50.013 --> 02:19:50.894]  No, you know what happened.
[02:19:51.736 --> 02:19:54.157]  Oh, last night on Tucker Carlson, powerful footage.
[02:19:54.157 --> 02:19:55.637]  This is stunning.
[02:19:55.637 --> 02:20:03.200]  Shocking body cam footage of police responding to altercation between Georgia Democrat Senate candidate Raphael Warnock and his wife released.
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:07.382]  Folks, his wife is a battered woman and was bawling on camera.
[02:20:07.382 --> 02:20:09.502]  I can't believe the Democrats would vote for this guy.
[02:20:09.502 --> 02:20:12.083]  I mean, this is like Keith Ellison level stuff.
[02:20:12.083 --> 02:20:18.306]  Acting Secretary of the Department of Defense Chris Miller thanks Vice President Pence for efforts in most complex military operation in history.
[02:20:18.306 --> 02:20:18.866]  What's that about?
[02:20:19.926 --> 02:20:22.929]  Pence plans to oversee January 6th Electoral College vote.
[02:20:22.929 --> 02:20:24.031]  He could save America.
[02:20:24.031 --> 02:20:25.692]  Then he leaves for Israel.
[02:20:25.692 --> 02:20:29.477]  Trump infuriated by Pence not fighting hard enough for election integrity.
[02:20:29.477 --> 02:20:31.739]  That just could be fake news from Axios.
[02:20:31.739 --> 02:20:33.962]  But either way, Pence has the opportunity to save America.
[02:20:33.962 --> 02:20:34.362]  Will he do it?
[02:20:35.323 --> 02:20:41.228]  And Think Tank star lawsuit witness admits to Tommy Robinson that they bribed him for testimony against U.S.
[02:20:41.228 --> 02:20:42.329]  Congressional staffer.
[02:20:42.329 --> 02:20:43.930]  Remember Tommy Robinson, folks.
[02:20:43.930 --> 02:20:46.732]  All right, we've got an emergency report from Alex Jones coming up.
[02:20:46.732 --> 02:21:00.463]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[02:21:00.683 --> 02:21:02.685]  It's all now completely official.
[02:21:02.685 --> 02:21:08.132]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab.
[02:21:08.132 --> 02:21:13.758]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them.
[02:21:13.758 --> 02:21:15.420]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here.
[02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:20.767]  And it only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[02:21:22.583 --> 02:21:28.905]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[02:21:28.905 --> 02:21:31.086]  We must start valuing human life again.
[02:21:31.086 --> 02:21:37.989]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:40.730]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[02:21:40.730 --> 02:21:44.151]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[02:21:46.530 --> 02:21:48.933]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[02:21:48.933 --> 02:21:51.816]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[02:21:51.816 --> 02:21:52.958]  Yes sir, yes sir.
[02:21:52.958 --> 02:22:00.487]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[02:22:00.487 --> 02:22:03.751]  I said man, I gotta get on that show and give him an update.
[02:22:04.131 --> 02:22:12.637]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[02:22:12.637 --> 02:22:18.562]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20, thanks to this Tenfold War Store products.
[02:22:18.562 --> 02:22:25.066]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night, so I'm doing what I can, brother.
[02:22:25.066 --> 02:22:28.429]  My contention is, why don't we start this new year off right?
[02:22:28.829 --> 02:22:31.810]  With everybody getting a couple bottles of Living Defense.
[02:22:31.810 --> 02:22:35.011]  Now you gotta follow that up with the Micro ZX.
[02:22:35.011 --> 02:22:36.052]  I learned that.
[02:22:36.052 --> 02:22:38.632]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[02:22:38.632 --> 02:22:39.293]  We didn't know.
[02:22:39.293 --> 02:22:40.453]  We didn't screen your call.
[02:22:40.453 --> 02:22:41.233]  We had no idea.
[02:22:41.233 --> 02:22:44.975]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[02:22:44.975 --> 02:22:45.615]  Living Defense.
[02:22:45.615 --> 02:22:47.175]  Living Defense.
[02:22:47.175 --> 02:22:47.656]  Living Defense.
[02:22:49.594 --> 02:22:52.015]  The Resistance dot video.
[02:22:52.015 --> 02:22:54.236]  The Resistance dot video.
[02:22:54.236 --> 02:22:56.398]  The Resistance dot video.
[02:22:56.398 --> 02:22:58.579]  The Resistance dot video.
[02:22:58.579 --> 02:23:01.440]  The Resistance dot video.
[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:03.421]  Infowars.com.
[02:23:03.421 --> 02:23:05.362]  Newswars.com.
[02:23:05.362 --> 02:23:06.903]  Ban dot video.
[02:23:06.903 --> 02:23:10.405]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[02:23:10.405 --> 02:23:15.408]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[02:23:16.608 --> 02:23:20.351]  Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[02:23:20.351 --> 02:23:25.014]  But the new website is TheResistance.Video.
[02:23:25.014 --> 02:23:26.935]  TheResistance.Video.
[02:23:26.935 --> 02:23:31.498]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[02:23:31.498 --> 02:23:42.004]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at TheResistance.Video.
[02:23:42.004 --> 02:23:42.905]  Share the link.
[02:23:42.905 --> 02:23:44.506]  TheResistance.Video.
[02:23:44.506 --> 02:23:45.667]  TheResistance.Video.
[02:23:49.875 --> 02:23:58.103]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:58.103 --> 02:23:59.705]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:59.705 --> 02:24:03.028]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:24:03.028 --> 02:24:04.009]  I'm telling America.
[02:24:15.111 --> 02:24:26.056]  Today I want to explain to you why I am so determined to pursue every legal and constitutional option available to stop the theft of the presidential election.
[02:24:26.056 --> 02:24:32.938]  As president, one of my most solemn duties is to protect the integrity of your sacred right to vote.
[02:24:32.938 --> 02:24:36.200]  This year, using the virus as a pretext,
[02:24:37.045 --> 02:24:51.536]  Democrat officials in the key swing states illegally violated their own state laws in order to enable, encourage, and facilitate fraud on a scale never before seen in the history of our country.
[02:24:51.536 --> 02:24:54.698]  The truth is, we won the election by a landslide.
[02:24:54.698 --> 02:24:56.199]  We won it big.
[02:24:56.199 --> 02:24:59.561]  Today, I'm going to give you the facts that every American needs to know.
[02:25:00.402 --> 02:25:03.623]  Let's go back to the night of the election.
[02:25:03.623 --> 02:25:07.684]  By midnight, we had a commanding lead in the swing states.
[02:25:07.684 --> 02:25:10.885]  We won Florida by a record number of votes.
[02:25:10.885 --> 02:25:14.087]  We won Ohio by a record number of votes.
[02:25:14.087 --> 02:25:21.529]  And likewise, we won Iowa by 8.2%, far different than the false narrative portrayed
[02:25:22.324 --> 02:25:28.850]  In the media, we were up by 293,000 votes in Michigan, 112,000 votes in Wisconsin, 356,000 votes in Georgia, and nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania, all swing states.
[02:25:28.850 --> 02:25:31.752]  These numbers were absolutely impossible for Joe Biden to overcome.
[02:25:44.443 --> 02:25:46.324]  And the Democrats knew it.
[02:25:46.324 --> 02:25:50.486]  And everybody forecasting knew it and understood it well.
[02:25:50.486 --> 02:25:55.389]  Our nation's greatest political professionals were calling to congratulate me on our victory.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:59.943]  Then suddenly everything started to disappear.
[02:25:59.943 --> 02:26:02.225]  Everything started to change.
[02:26:02.225 --> 02:26:06.609]  The vote counting abruptly stopped in multiple states.
[02:26:06.609 --> 02:26:16.318]  In the middle of the night, a series of massive and statistically inconceivable vote dumps overturned the results in state after state.
[02:26:17.737 --> 02:26:23.661]  At 6.31am, very early in the morning, Michigan suddenly reported 147,224 votes.
[02:26:23.661 --> 02:26:24.561]  94% for Biden, 6% for Trump.
[02:26:33.797 --> 02:26:43.484]  At 4.42 a.m., Wisconsin reported 143,279 votes, almost all of them for Biden.
[02:26:43.484 --> 02:26:48.788]  A similar massive drop of ballots happened in Georgia at 1.34 a.m.
[02:26:48.788 --> 02:26:52.790]  Again, almost all of these votes for Biden.
[02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:56.073]  These gigantic and ridiculously one-sided spikes
[02:26:56.673 --> 02:27:04.360]  We're miraculously just enough to push Joe Biden into the lead in all of the key swing states.
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:08.184]  These glaring anomalies are just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:27:08.184 --> 02:27:19.234]  We won 18 of 19 bellwether counties, a record that have correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election for the last 40 years.
[02:27:19.234 --> 02:27:21.697]  We also won Ohio, Florida,
[02:27:22.077 --> 02:27:23.359]  We're good to go.
[02:27:37.876 --> 02:27:39.617]  And it wasn't even close.
[02:27:39.617 --> 02:27:47.001]  With Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, the Democrats lost 25 out of 26 toss-up House seats.
[02:27:47.001 --> 02:27:48.202]  That's a record.
[02:27:48.202 --> 02:27:59.008]  Democrats were projected to gain 15 seats, and instead, because of my success and coattails, as they call them, they lost 14 seats.
[02:27:59.008 --> 02:27:59.829]  So think of that.
[02:28:00.329 --> 02:28:04.312]  They were going to win big and they ended up losing big.
[02:28:04.312 --> 02:28:08.275]  My campaign received more votes than any president in history.
[02:28:08.275 --> 02:28:11.598]  Almost 75 million people voted for me.
[02:28:11.598 --> 02:28:16.982]  We earned approximately 12 million more votes than we got in 2016.
[02:28:16.982 --> 02:28:21.905]  The largest vote increase for an incumbent president ever recorded.
[02:28:21.905 --> 02:28:25.308]  I also received the largest share of non-white voters
[02:28:25.828 --> 02:28:29.009]  of any Republican in over 60 years.
[02:28:29.009 --> 02:28:50.595]  In fact, we did better with African-American and Hispanic voters everywhere in the country, except for a small handful of corrupt Democrat-run cities in key swing states, places notorious for fraud, such as Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta, and Philadelphia, all run by Democrat machine politicians.
[02:28:51.275 --> 02:28:56.980]  No president has ever lost re-election while making such extraordinary gains across the board.
[02:28:56.980 --> 02:28:59.883]  There's never been anything like it.
[02:28:59.883 --> 02:29:06.389]  Yet despite all of this evidence of a thundering Trump victory, and all of those projections all through the night,
[02:29:07.210 --> 02:29:21.032]  They want us to believe that Joe Biden, who seldom left his basement to campaign, somehow received 11.7 million more votes than Barack Obama, and he beat Barack Obama all over the country.
[02:29:21.863 --> 02:29:26.567]  It is historically, mathematically, politically, and logically impossible.
[02:29:26.567 --> 02:29:27.909]  It did not happen.
[02:29:27.909 --> 02:29:29.330]  He did not win.
[02:29:29.330 --> 02:29:31.332]  We won by a landslide.
[02:29:31.332 --> 02:29:41.501]  Over the past seven weeks, we have put forth abundant evidence proving how the Democrats perpetrated this monstrous fraud on the American people and indeed the world.
[02:29:42.242 --> 02:29:58.636]  First, we have shown that officials in virtually every key swing state brazenly violated their own state laws in order to change election procedures, eliminate safeguards, promote fraud, and illegally benefit Joe Biden.
[02:29:58.636 --> 02:30:04.120]  And legislatures which have to make the changes were seldom, if ever, used.
[02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:07.964]  For example, Pennsylvania's radical Democrat Secretary of State
[02:30:08.664 --> 02:30:19.130]  Suspended all signature verification requirements, breaking Pennsylvania law, not to mention the big and very illegal ballot drops.
[02:30:19.130 --> 02:30:31.457]  In Michigan, the Secretary of State, a Democrat, illegally flooded the state with absentee ballot applications, even though Michigan law strictly limits the distribution of absentee ballots.
[02:30:32.017 --> 02:30:46.163]  In Wisconsin, the major Democrat cities deployed over 500 unmanned, unsecured ballot drop boxes that were blatantly illegal, paving the way for unlawful ballot harvesting and tremendous fraud.
[02:30:46.163 --> 02:30:51.826]  In Georgia, the Secretary of State began illegally processing ballots weeks before Election Day
[02:30:52.566 --> 02:30:58.370]  And also destroyed the signature verification systems in violation of the law.
[02:30:58.370 --> 02:31:01.773]  Many other horrible things were done in Georgia.
[02:31:01.773 --> 02:31:06.457]  These actions alone were more than enough to rig the election results for Democrats.
[02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:15.964]  Second, the absentee ballot rejection rates proved that hundreds of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted in the key states.
[02:31:15.964 --> 02:31:20.727]  This was sufficient to change the election results all on its own.
[02:31:21.528 --> 02:31:26.837]  In 2016, 6.4% of mail-in ballots were rejected in Georgia.
[02:31:27.728 --> 02:31:33.592]  This year, fewer than a tiny percentage of 1% were rejected.
[02:31:33.592 --> 02:31:39.476]  So you went all the way down, a difference of more than 30 times.
[02:31:39.476 --> 02:31:43.338]  The same phenomenon occurred in Pennsylvania and other states.
[02:31:43.338 --> 02:31:49.882]  They were accepting all of these ballots, many of which were absolutely illegal.
[02:31:49.882 --> 02:31:53.405]  In a year in which the number of mail-in ballots was the highest ever,
[02:31:53.905 --> 02:32:00.010]  The rejection rate was magically the lowest ever, and it wasn't even close.
[02:32:00.010 --> 02:32:08.816]  The only possible explanation is that tens of thousands of ballots were unlawfully processed and counted.
[02:32:08.816 --> 02:32:20.045]  Most Americans would be shocked to learn that in no swing state is there any meaningful attempt to verify citizenship, residency, identity, or eligibility.
[02:32:20.485 --> 02:32:27.772]  Third, hundreds and hundreds of witnesses have come forward to testify under penalty of perjury about the cheating and fraud they saw with their own eyes.
[02:32:39.784 --> 02:32:57.472]  Witnesses have sworn that they saw poll workers illegally backdating thousands of ballots, counting batches of the same ballots many times, and unloading boxes and boxes of ballots all bearing the same signature, and all for Joe Biden.
[02:32:58.052 --> 02:33:08.114]  Other witnesses have testified to seeing thousands of so-called pristine ballots with no creases or folds, all voting for Biden.
[02:33:08.114 --> 02:33:11.775]  When you have no fold, it means it wasn't mailed.
[02:33:11.775 --> 02:33:13.896]  It means it was a fraud.
[02:33:13.896 --> 02:33:24.018]  Republican poll watchers were denied critical access as hundreds of thousands of votes were counted in Democrat-run cities in the essential states.
[02:33:24.018 --> 02:33:26.439]  There is even security camera footage from Georgia
[02:33:27.119 --> 02:33:37.665]  That shows officials telling poll watchers to leave the room before pulling suitcases of ballots out from under the tables and continuing to count for hours.
[02:33:37.665 --> 02:33:46.050]  The reason they were forced to leave the room, as they said, there was a major water main break.
[02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:47.751]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[02:33:47.751 --> 02:33:49.132]  Thank you for holding.
[02:33:49.132 --> 02:33:49.873]  How you doing Alex?
[02:33:50.666 --> 02:33:52.087]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[02:33:52.087 --> 02:33:53.307]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[02:33:53.307 --> 02:33:54.028]  How are you?
[02:33:54.028 --> 02:33:54.828]  I love you, man.
[02:33:54.828 --> 02:33:57.129]  I want to make a quick plug.
[02:33:57.129 --> 02:33:59.010]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[02:33:59.010 --> 02:34:15.457]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[02:34:16.135 --> 02:34:21.540]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:35.051]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products, and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[02:34:35.051 --> 02:34:39.754]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[02:34:39.754 --> 02:34:41.216]  So thanks for the plug.
[02:34:45.922 --> 02:34:49.283]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[02:34:49.283 --> 02:34:52.403]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[02:34:52.403 --> 02:35:00.044]  Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out force, for a political or financial reason.
[02:35:00.044 --> 02:35:03.925]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[02:35:03.925 --> 02:35:07.406]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[02:35:07.406 --> 02:35:09.826]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[02:35:09.826 --> 02:35:12.227]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[02:35:12.227 --> 02:35:14.027]  COVID more devastating than you'd ever imagine.
[02:35:14.787 --> 02:35:21.051]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[02:35:21.051 --> 02:35:21.991]  Okay?
[02:35:21.991 --> 02:35:26.574]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[02:35:26.574 --> 02:35:28.875]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[02:35:28.875 --> 02:35:29.696]  These are real numbers.
[02:35:29.696 --> 02:35:30.957]  These are real facts.
[02:35:30.957 --> 02:35:36.240]  This is the chicken little event where we all run in our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential.
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:38.341]  All the big box stores and Amazon take over the planet.
[02:35:38.821 --> 02:35:40.782]  Rebuke it, stand up against it.
[02:35:40.782 --> 02:35:42.562]  This is slavery.
[02:35:42.562 --> 02:35:47.243]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[02:35:47.243 --> 02:35:51.424]  Christmas 2020 is here, but will soon be gone.
[02:35:51.424 --> 02:36:03.928]  But I want to encourage all of you to recommit the year 2020, and I'm talking to myself when I say this, to exercise and to treat our bodies better, and to take high quality supplements along with a nutritious diet.
[02:36:04.908 --> 02:36:17.995]  We got back in stock just a few days ago a big shipment of Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3 you're going to find, also with vitamin K. These are essential vitamins for your immune system.
[02:36:17.995 --> 02:36:22.197]  With everything going on in the world, it's important for all of us to protect ourselves.
[02:36:22.197 --> 02:36:27.460]  It's for children, it's for women, it's for men, it's for young, it's for old, it's for everybody.
[02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:30.922]  It's Winter Sun sold out for almost three months.
[02:36:30.922 --> 02:36:32.402]  Now back in stock, 50% off.
[02:36:33.843 --> 02:36:35.704]  Introducing Infowars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[02:36:35.704 --> 02:36:37.585]  This is taken under the tongue.
[02:36:37.585 --> 02:36:38.305]  It is pure turmeric.
[02:36:57.350 --> 02:37:06.562]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[02:37:06.562 --> 02:37:12.409]  This is absorbed under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[02:37:12.409 --> 02:37:14.552]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[02:37:14.992 --> 02:37:18.233]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[02:37:18.233 --> 02:37:20.073]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[02:37:20.073 --> 02:37:22.193]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[02:37:22.193 --> 02:37:24.374]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[02:37:24.374 --> 02:37:25.734]  Some like bodies better.
[02:37:25.734 --> 02:37:29.875]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[02:37:29.875 --> 02:37:31.055]  And they fund the InfoWare.

[02:37:49.815 --> 02:37:52.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:37:58.628 --> 02:38:04.853]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:38:20.143 --> 02:38:31.668]  Last weekend, I had to go to a mediation for a lawsuit that I'm in, and I'm there at this big law firm for about five hours, and there's other legal things going on in the building.
[02:38:31.668 --> 02:38:41.493]  I had been there for another mediation and short court hearing about two months ago, and while I was there, got information from the CEO of a very
[02:38:42.654 --> 02:38:42.834]  I don't
[02:39:05.457 --> 02:39:06.358]  Here's what I'm getting at.
[02:39:06.358 --> 02:39:10.060]  This story I'm telling you is as real as the sun coming up this morning.
[02:39:10.060 --> 02:39:11.060]  This happened.
[02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:13.802]  And if you type in the name of this company, boom, you'd see it all over the place.
[02:39:13.802 --> 02:39:14.622]  Kind of leave it at that.
[02:39:14.622 --> 02:39:19.205]  Let's just say they're experts on everything you see happening with this mRNA information.
[02:39:19.205 --> 02:39:26.949]  Because these folks develop real stuff, real antibodies, that do absolutely incredible stuff that the FDA has not approved a bunch of.
[02:39:26.949 --> 02:39:30.191]  And we're talking about antibodies that actually just destroy cancer, just knock it out.
[02:39:30.751 --> 02:39:32.953]  We're talking super live extension type stuff.
[02:39:32.953 --> 02:39:39.877]  He said months ago that Fauci is a complete fraud and this is all about money and that Gates is a big scammer.
[02:39:39.877 --> 02:39:48.283]  But now he had more information and he had just met with these lawyers a few days before on another issue not related to me and was telling them
[02:39:49.384 --> 02:39:51.546]  I'm sticking his finger out in their chest, which he never done.
[02:39:51.546 --> 02:39:52.827]  They've known him many years.
[02:39:52.827 --> 02:39:53.648]  They're friends with him.
[02:39:53.648 --> 02:40:01.935]  And yet he's a scientist, saying, you do not take that mRNA vaccine for Moderna or Pfizer if your life depends on it.
[02:40:01.935 --> 02:40:05.918]  And he then went into a big rant, and the lawyers didn't even want to tell me.
[02:40:05.918 --> 02:40:06.819]  But let me explain something.
[02:40:06.819 --> 02:40:08.520]  These are both high-powered lawyers.
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:12.404]  One of them looked completely scared and said, well, you ought to just reach out and talk to him yourself.
[02:40:12.404 --> 02:40:13.184]  But basically,
[02:40:14.105 --> 02:40:14.285]  Okay.
[02:40:34.975 --> 02:40:41.460]  Chief Scientist of Pfizer saying the same thing, that we've looked at this and this could kill you easily.
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:45.703]  This will turn your immune system off, it will turn it up, it will cause autoimmune disorders.
[02:40:45.703 --> 02:40:47.745]  What the world are you doing?
[02:40:47.745 --> 02:40:51.588]  It attacks a basic protein that's in the body.
[02:40:51.588 --> 02:40:54.450]  So on its face it looks like it's meant to cause an autoimmune disorder.
[02:40:55.891 --> 02:41:00.656]  Weeks go by like seconds now with Trump and the White House and the battles and all things going on.
[02:41:00.656 --> 02:41:03.319]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is end-of-the-world type stuff.
[02:41:03.319 --> 02:41:12.828]  I mean, we're being hit with something that's super dangerous and deadly, and that the first effects are very, very bad, that they've undoubtedly already tested the animal secretly.
[02:41:12.828 --> 02:41:14.750]  When they claim they skipped animal testing, that's not true.
[02:41:15.871 --> 02:41:19.253]  We know they've been testing this type of stuff all over the world on animals.
[02:41:19.253 --> 02:41:25.798]  And bottom line, it will attack the placenta, so women can't have their embryo attached in the uterus.
[02:41:25.798 --> 02:41:28.239]  Bottom line, it's just full of nastiness.
[02:41:28.239 --> 02:41:33.523]  And it is the virus as well, which itself is some type of weird nanotech creation.
[02:41:33.523 --> 02:41:34.724]  So when people look at this,
[02:41:35.444 --> 02:41:37.025]  They're top scientists.
[02:41:37.025 --> 02:41:37.885]  And a bunch of them are named.
[02:41:37.885 --> 02:41:38.765]  I just named some of them.
[02:41:38.765 --> 02:41:40.966]  But this is someone that is in Texas.
[02:41:40.966 --> 02:41:42.827]  This is someone that knows this.
[02:41:42.827 --> 02:41:46.609]  And is literally sticking his finger in people's chest saying, do not take it.
[02:41:46.609 --> 02:41:47.869]  And it's the craziness of this.
[02:41:47.869 --> 02:41:49.530]  Like, how are they going to get away with it?
[02:41:49.530 --> 02:41:51.951]  Like, what's the bigger plan here?
[02:41:51.951 --> 02:41:53.232]  Why are they moving so quick?
[02:41:53.232 --> 02:41:54.672]  Like, they have a gun to their head.
[02:41:54.672 --> 02:41:58.774]  People overuse the Nazi analogy, but this is what this is.
[02:41:58.774 --> 02:42:01.155]  This doesn't just violate the Nuremberg Code or the Geneva Convention.
[02:42:01.155 --> 02:42:02.555]  This blows them into pieces.
[02:42:02.555 --> 02:42:03.216]  The good news is,
[02:42:04.568 --> 02:42:11.490]  Black folks particularly are refusing to take the vaccine because they know the secret history of experimentation and the rest of it, but everybody's getting experimented on.
[02:42:11.490 --> 02:42:16.211]  And again, I'm going to say it for the hundredth time, this is not a vaccine.
[02:42:16.211 --> 02:42:17.212]  This is not a vaccine.
[02:42:17.212 --> 02:42:18.332]  This is not a vaccine.
[02:42:18.332 --> 02:42:19.692]  So I'm going to get on the phone today.
[02:42:19.692 --> 02:42:22.493]  I'm going to try to contact this person, try to see if they'll go public.
[02:42:22.493 --> 02:42:26.955]  And again, I'm so demonized, my show might not be the place for it to happen, but I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:42:26.955 --> 02:42:29.175]  But again, why am I even talking about this?
[02:42:29.175 --> 02:42:31.336]  We have the former chief scientist
[02:42:32.136 --> 02:42:36.499]  Who quit at a good point in his life, no problems, no background, not disgraced.
[02:42:36.499 --> 02:42:40.841]  Ed Pfizer saying exactly what this scientist is saying.
[02:42:40.841 --> 02:42:44.644]  But the thing is, this scientist is particularly a world expert on this.
[02:42:44.644 --> 02:42:47.406]  I mean, I spent hours when I first learned about this.
[02:42:48.166 --> 02:42:54.411]  Reading his Curricula Vitae and all the stuff he's done and then I spent more hours a few days ago and then just like I woke up at 5 a.m.
[02:42:54.411 --> 02:42:56.913]  I was like, why did you not cover this yet?
[02:42:56.913 --> 02:42:58.475]  So there you go folks.
[02:42:58.475 --> 02:42:59.115]  I don't know what to say.
[02:42:59.115 --> 02:43:00.116]  I don't know what to do.
[02:43:00.116 --> 02:43:03.519]  I don't know how to get people to think for themselves at this point.
[02:43:03.519 --> 02:43:10.064]  But I know you know as an audience what's going on, but we are like basically locked in in this purgatory in this phantom zone.
[02:43:10.825 --> 02:43:11.466]  We're all in grave danger.
[02:43:34.008 --> 02:43:40.335]  A lot of people have been asking me in the last week, is it true that Vice President Mike Pence could refuse to certify the electors?
[02:43:40.335 --> 02:43:42.277]  And the answer is, absolutely.
[02:43:42.277 --> 02:43:44.960]  And then people say, well, you know, is it true what Patrick Howley says?
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:49.545]  Is it true what National File says about this memo and about the letters being circulated at the White House?
[02:43:49.545 --> 02:43:51.087]  Yes, folks, it's all true.
[02:43:51.087 --> 02:43:55.191]  And today is the day that if Pence is going to reject it, he's got to do it.
[02:43:55.191 --> 02:43:55.652]  December 23rd.
[02:43:56.152 --> 02:44:10.321]  Remember two weeks ago, I reported a story on air, the headline was from CNN, saying Mike Pence will seal Trump's fate December 23rd, and then they were bragging about how Pence will deliver the final blow like Brutus to Julius Caesar.
[02:44:10.321 --> 02:44:13.583]  So you can pull up that article, you can see where they said it, where they gloated about it.
[02:44:13.923 --> 02:44:18.869]  So what I think is going on here is a lot of people in the liberty movement are like, hey, look, we discovered this.
[02:44:18.869 --> 02:44:19.570]  This is going on.
[02:44:19.570 --> 02:44:20.831]  We need to do something.
[02:44:20.831 --> 02:44:25.536]  And folks then just kind of let it go by the wayside because, oh, that's just the liberty movement.
[02:44:25.536 --> 02:44:27.378]  You know, that's just that's just national follow.
[02:44:27.378 --> 02:44:28.360]  That's just in force.
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:28.700]  And it's this.
[02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:33.882]  The thing we do, it's like the psychology, like we're on the outside, like we're small.
[02:44:33.882 --> 02:44:40.844]  And I see this over and over again, that when we have all these incredible tools that are so damning to the globalists, we don't promote them or we deny them.
[02:44:40.844 --> 02:44:41.805]  We don't believe it's real.
[02:44:41.805 --> 02:44:53.569]  And I think a lot of that is also the Q movement, and I'm not putting down Q people, whatever, always wanting to believe in nebulous things that are secret and esoteric and encoded instead of all the real stuff that's out there, folks.
[02:44:53.769 --> 02:45:10.640]  You know, Rudolph Giuliani just did an interview on The War Room, not our War Room, the other one that Steve Bannon does, still a good show, and he said that it's very possible that today or tomorrow the Arizona legislature is going to vote to decertify Biden and certify Trump because they did find the hundreds of thousands of votes.
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:13.842]  A judge also said 200,000 votes were fraudulent.
[02:45:14.722 --> 02:45:16.784]  In Wisconsin, you don't see that anywhere on the news.
[02:45:16.784 --> 02:45:20.086]  It's on Infowars.com, it's on Gateway Pundit, really nowhere else.
[02:45:20.086 --> 02:45:20.506]  No one cares.
[02:45:20.506 --> 02:45:22.808]  It's like, you know, just give up.
[02:45:22.808 --> 02:45:33.034]  And then the legislature in Georgia came out two days ago and said, we find evidence of master fraud and Joe Biden should be decertified.
[02:45:33.034 --> 02:45:34.555]  And they voted in the committee to say that.
[02:45:34.555 --> 02:45:36.356]  So it needs to go to the full legislature.
[02:45:36.356 --> 02:45:39.238]  But as you know, they've not called in that emergency session the way they should.
[02:45:40.239 --> 02:45:42.120]  When they say there's no evidence of fraud, that's not true.
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:52.928]  What's going on is there isn't the political will to stand up and point this fraud out and say that Joe Biden's a scammer because he's run the giant hoax, just like Russiagate, just like the impeachment, just like all of it.
[02:45:52.928 --> 02:46:03.216]  Now they have this big hoax where he's up there with his background saying president-elect and the media all goes along with it and China Mitch, Mitch McConnell, he goes along with it and it's just absolutely insane.
[02:46:03.216 --> 02:46:05.657]  We are watching this be stolen.
[02:46:05.657 --> 02:46:07.439]  President Trump is absolutely right.
[02:46:07.439 --> 02:46:08.759]  This is a fraud and
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:10.600]  He has the evidence.
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:12.061]  And so the question is, what does Trump do?
[02:46:12.061 --> 02:46:12.941]  What do we do?
[02:46:12.941 --> 02:46:18.023]  Well, we get these articles, all of which are posted on fullwords.com and we get them out to everybody.
[02:46:18.023 --> 02:46:20.884]  And you go to gatewaypundit.com and you get it out to everybody.
[02:46:20.884 --> 02:46:25.586]  And you print copies of it and you hand it around your office or you talk about it at Christmas because
[02:46:26.306 --> 02:46:28.187]  We have to do this grassroots.
[02:46:28.187 --> 02:46:34.549]  Grassroots, upwards of 80% of Americans say they will not take the vaccine because they believe it's secret experimentation.
[02:46:34.549 --> 02:46:37.370]  Despite all the propaganda, the grassroots got the truth out.
[02:46:37.370 --> 02:46:39.751]  And it's the same on every other subject.
[02:46:39.751 --> 02:46:41.972]  The more these globalists push, the less power they have.
[02:46:42.432 --> 02:46:43.873]  That's why they've done the mask.
[02:46:43.873 --> 02:46:46.854]  It's a symbol of our shame, a symbol that we're all dirty and bad.
[02:46:46.854 --> 02:46:47.655]  Humans are bad.
[02:46:47.655 --> 02:46:48.655]  Get rid of humans.
[02:46:48.655 --> 02:46:56.179]  As an exercise of peer pressure over us, where we don't do it for ourselves, we do it for other people believing that it's virtuous.
[02:46:56.179 --> 02:46:57.620]  It's not virtuous.
[02:46:57.620 --> 02:46:59.320]  It's spreading bacterial pneumonia.
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:00.401]  Evidence shows where they wear the
[02:47:00.421 --> 02:47:01.141]  We're good to go.
[02:47:29.619 --> 02:47:35.742]  Just because somebody's driving out of your parking lot with your truck doesn't mean it's theirs just because they stole the keys.
[02:47:35.742 --> 02:47:36.222]  Okay?
[02:47:36.222 --> 02:47:37.122]  And that's what's going on here.
[02:47:37.122 --> 02:47:38.543]  Joe Biden's stolen the country.
[02:47:38.543 --> 02:47:39.343]  He says it's his.
[02:47:39.343 --> 02:47:40.144]  He's an imposter.
[02:47:40.144 --> 02:47:40.844]  He's a fraud.
[02:47:40.844 --> 02:47:47.747]  It's like coming home from a year-long business trip or something and somebody's moved into your house and has told your neighbors that they're your brother or cousin.
[02:47:47.747 --> 02:47:49.088]  And you say, no, this is not my brother.
[02:47:49.088 --> 02:47:50.168]  And they say, I am your brother.
[02:47:50.168 --> 02:47:51.389]  And you're like, no, you're not my brother.
[02:47:51.389 --> 02:47:53.089]  And they sit there with total confidence.
[02:47:53.089 --> 02:47:57.391]  Your neighbor, listen, I am his brother and I have the deed to the house now.
[02:47:57.391 --> 02:47:58.692]  And if he says with enough confidence,
[02:47:59.352 --> 02:48:01.954]  And you've been gone a year, the neighbors will believe it.
[02:48:01.954 --> 02:48:03.274]  There's actually been cases like this.
[02:48:03.274 --> 02:48:05.816]  Because people just can't believe they're being conned.
[02:48:05.816 --> 02:48:08.237]  If the con artist has total and complete confidence.
[02:48:08.237 --> 02:48:09.558]  And so that's what's going on here.
[02:48:09.558 --> 02:48:11.539]  So yes, it's true.
[02:48:11.539 --> 02:48:14.261]  Yes, Mike Pence has it all in his hands.
[02:48:14.261 --> 02:48:15.541]  And we're gonna see what he's gonna do today.
[02:48:15.541 --> 02:48:21.965]  I have a stinging suspicion he's gonna probably betray the president because of all the peer pressure and because he's a politician that was drawn from the swamp.
[02:48:21.965 --> 02:48:24.787]  I may be pleasantly surprised, so we should all pray.
[02:48:24.787 --> 02:48:25.047]  Thank you.
[02:48:36.238 --> 02:48:39.359]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[02:48:39.359 --> 02:48:43.221]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[02:48:43.221 --> 02:48:53.086]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[02:48:53.086 --> 02:48:55.127]  They are going to explode gas prices.
[02:48:55.127 --> 02:48:57.247]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[02:48:57.247 --> 02:48:59.569]  They're going to cut off the energy source to the U.S.
[02:48:59.569 --> 02:49:02.310]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[02:49:02.310 --> 02:49:03.910]  This is economic domination.
[02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:04.751]  This is economic war.
[02:49:05.231 --> 02:49:06.272]  We're being consolidated.
[02:49:06.272 --> 02:49:07.473]  We're being taken over.
[02:49:07.473 --> 02:49:10.895]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[02:49:10.895 --> 02:49:20.201]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heel and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[02:49:20.201 --> 02:49:22.102]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[02:49:22.102 --> 02:49:23.823]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[02:49:23.823 --> 02:49:26.345]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[02:49:26.345 --> 02:49:27.986]  That's what social distancing is.
[02:49:27.986 --> 02:49:31.429]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years.
[02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:33.610]  No small businesses will be there.
[02:49:33.610 --> 02:49:34.791]  This is a master plan.
[02:49:34.791 --> 02:49:35.071]  Say no.
[02:49:38.114 --> 02:49:45.441]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy, or technocrats.
[02:49:45.441 --> 02:49:56.872]  You will get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments.
[02:49:57.592 --> 02:49:59.693]  But they want businessman technocrats over it.
[02:49:59.693 --> 02:50:01.535]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[02:50:01.535 --> 02:50:07.018]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[02:50:07.018 --> 02:50:10.480]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:12.842]  You see, he believes because he's hidden in plain view.
[02:50:13.742 --> 02:50:15.083]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:50:50.546 --> 02:50:57.272]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:50:57.272 --> 02:51:01.696]  You better believe you've got one!
[02:51:01.696 --> 02:51:06.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:51:19.070 --> 02:51:19.151]  you
[02:51:26.271 --> 02:51:30.253]  Ah, the globalist crime lords are licking their lips.
[02:51:30.253 --> 02:51:36.256]  They've been fighting for decades to undermine and divide and bankrupt this country, and now they're so close.
[02:51:36.256 --> 02:51:37.917]  Look at the CNN headline.
[02:51:37.917 --> 02:51:45.180]  Who's Who in Donald Trump's Desperate Last Stand by Michael Warren and Kevin Liptack.
[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:49.042]  A ragtag team of former-age lawyers, elected Republicans, and
[02:51:49.782 --> 02:51:50.763]  Sick offense.
[02:51:50.763 --> 02:51:52.264]  Talk about projection.
[02:51:52.264 --> 02:52:02.672]  From the outside have grabbed Donald Trump's ear at a time when many of his longtime allies and government have backed away from the president, increasingly extreme ploys for staying in office.
[02:52:02.672 --> 02:52:08.897]  Oh, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has acknowledged Joe Biden won the election in a speech to the floor of the Senate.
[02:52:08.897 --> 02:52:14.101]  Outgoing Attorney General William Barr has said there was no widespread election fraud and instead
[02:52:14.861 --> 02:52:15.141]  That's right.
[02:52:35.546 --> 02:52:38.067]  And he knows he won this election, and the evidence is overwhelming.
[02:52:38.067 --> 02:52:39.347]  We've already gone over it.
[02:52:39.347 --> 02:52:51.831]  And Big Tech is having to censor Senate hearings where Senator Rand Paul says there's clear evidence of fraud, and other senators present it in hours of powerful bombshell testimony.
[02:52:51.831 --> 02:52:53.171]  So you remember that.
[02:52:53.171 --> 02:52:54.532]  This evidence is so fake.
[02:52:54.532 --> 02:52:56.052]  This evidence is not real.
[02:52:56.052 --> 02:52:58.133]  It doesn't exist, so you're not allowed to see it.
[02:52:58.133 --> 02:53:00.514]  This is a systematic attack on our way of life.
[02:53:01.354 --> 02:53:05.416]  Not just on our speech, but on the very existence of our country itself.
[02:53:05.416 --> 02:53:13.601]  And voting is a major form of action, a major form of speech, and they are nullifying it in front of us, and then trying to gaslight us.
[02:53:13.601 --> 02:53:15.782]  This is not President Trump's last stand.
[02:53:15.782 --> 02:53:19.905]  One of the most true things he ever said was, they don't hate me, they hate you.
[02:53:19.905 --> 02:53:21.626]  And they've got to get through me to get to you.
[02:53:22.526 --> 02:53:24.286]  And we've come so far together.
[02:53:24.286 --> 02:53:25.387]  They're going to fight us hard.
[02:53:25.387 --> 02:53:28.047]  We can win this, but it's not going to be easy.
[02:53:28.047 --> 02:53:30.708]  I'm paraphrasing, but you've already said that many times.
[02:53:30.708 --> 02:53:31.748]  And it's absolutely true.
[02:53:31.748 --> 02:53:32.868]  And that goes for your life.
[02:53:32.868 --> 02:53:33.788]  It goes for your family.
[02:53:33.788 --> 02:53:34.788]  It goes for my family.
[02:53:34.788 --> 02:53:35.848]  It goes for my life.
[02:53:35.848 --> 02:53:37.629]  I am proud to stand with President Trump.
[02:53:37.629 --> 02:53:39.929]  I am proud to stand with you, the Infowarriors.
[02:53:39.929 --> 02:53:43.370]  I am brought to tears every time you come in and thank me.
[02:53:43.370 --> 02:53:44.650]  And people say, why don't you let me thank you?
[02:53:44.650 --> 02:53:45.990]  It's because it humbles me.
[02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.871]  And I appreciate you.
[02:53:46.871 --> 02:53:47.471]  And I love you.
[02:53:47.471 --> 02:53:48.591]  And it makes me get a tear in my eye.
[02:53:49.471 --> 02:53:56.317]  I know you're counting on me, and I don't know if I'm going to be strong enough myself to carry this through, but I'll tell you who is strong enough, and that's God Almighty.
[02:53:56.317 --> 02:54:13.090]  So we all need to get on our knees before Jesus Christ, Son of God, every day, and thank God for life and consciousness and will, everything good in this universe that we've been given, and to ask God to come into our hearts and our souls stronger than ever before, to lead, guide, and direct us in this holy cause of standing up against the globalists.
[02:54:14.051 --> 02:54:16.693]  As negative as all this is, we woke up.
[02:54:16.693 --> 02:54:17.613]  We woke up the world.
[02:54:17.613 --> 02:54:22.676]  We forced the globalists out in the open, and that's why they're throwing all their forces at us now.
[02:54:22.676 --> 02:54:33.882]  So I just want to pray in the name of Jesus for InfoWars, for President Trump, for America, for the whole world, for all the children in bondage, for all the women in bondage, for all the innocents in bondage, and for all the captives and all the slaves.
[02:54:33.882 --> 02:54:40.126]  And I pray in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that he break the bonds of Satan as he did on Calgary.
[02:54:40.626 --> 02:54:41.166]  We're good to go.
[02:55:06.561 --> 02:55:11.884]  That will trigger an even greater insurrection against Satan and his minions for the innocent, for the children.
[02:55:11.884 --> 02:55:17.367]  And we know no matter what happens to Trump, no matter what, no matter what happens to us, it's all part of your greater plan.
[02:55:17.367 --> 02:55:18.747]  And we understand that.
[02:55:18.747 --> 02:55:19.648]  And we're thankful for that.
[02:55:19.648 --> 02:55:21.289]  And we're just thankful for being part of it.
[02:55:21.289 --> 02:55:27.532]  We know it's up to us to do the right thing to stand up and tell the truth and that you work in mysterious ways and the outcome is up to you.
[02:55:27.532 --> 02:55:29.253]  We all know it's part of your greater plan.
[02:55:29.253 --> 02:55:31.714]  We thank you in the name of your son, Jesus Christ.
[02:55:45.163 --> 02:55:48.845]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[02:55:48.845 --> 02:55:58.529]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big pharma are all pushing the cub as the most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[02:55:58.529 --> 02:56:01.790]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[02:56:01.790 --> 02:56:04.391]  That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes.
[02:56:04.391 --> 02:56:13.995]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones,
[02:56:14.275 --> 02:56:16.417]  Are basically bioweapons and are super deadly.
[02:56:16.417 --> 02:56:19.679]  And now they're having to resuscitate people that die, basically.
[02:56:19.679 --> 02:56:22.902]  When they take it, just like newborn babies, they get vaccines.
[02:56:22.902 --> 02:56:25.904]  They have to resuscitate them all the time, or a lot of times they just let them die.
[02:56:25.904 --> 02:56:27.946]  And that's on the record, it does that.
[02:56:27.946 --> 02:56:31.489]  Guillain-Barré's, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases.
[02:56:31.489 --> 02:56:32.790]  But they tell you, safe and effective.
[02:56:32.790 --> 02:56:33.471]  No one's getting hurt.
[02:56:33.471 --> 02:56:34.671]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[02:56:34.671 --> 02:56:38.254]  And then all the fine print says can kill you absolutely deadly.
[02:56:38.254 --> 02:56:41.997]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous.
[02:56:41.997 --> 02:56:43.799]  Because the media says it's safe, they do it.
[02:56:47.182 --> 02:56:53.647]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:59.665 --> 02:57:02.187]  It's Wednesday, December 23rd.
[02:57:02.187 --> 02:57:03.647]  The year is 2020.
[02:57:03.647 --> 02:57:12.853]  We're only 27 days out from the attempted inauguration of a communist Chinese spy, Joe Biden, to the presidency of the United States.
[02:57:12.853 --> 02:57:25.681]  If this happens, it becomes a 90 plus percent chance that you can basically create a tombstone saying United States of America born July 4th, 1776, United States of America dead January 20th, 2021.
[02:57:27.802 --> 02:57:35.448]  And as I've said many times, unlike a person, a country or an idea or an organization can be resurrected from the ashes.
[02:57:35.448 --> 02:57:39.932]  But this will constitute the death of our republic.
[02:57:39.932 --> 02:57:49.219]  It's that serious, the stakes are that high, and the globalists know there's going to be a counter-push, and so they're going to come down on us with both feet stomping on our political heads and souls.
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:53.042]  Biden has said the worst is yet to come with COVID.
[02:57:53.042 --> 02:57:53.783]  Gates of the U.N.
[02:57:53.783 --> 02:57:55.885]  say it never ends.
[02:57:55.885 --> 02:57:57.506]  Never ends.
[02:57:57.506 --> 02:57:59.187]  Small businesses locked down.
[02:57:59.187 --> 02:58:00.148]  Masks.
[02:58:00.148 --> 02:58:01.149]  Forced inoculations.
[02:58:01.149 --> 02:58:07.954]  And as I predicted, we've got our archivists looking for it, but you heard me say this probably 50 times in the last 10 months.
[02:58:07.954 --> 02:58:13.198]  A new strain arrived in England and now the vaccines won't work.
[02:58:13.198 --> 02:58:13.979]  That's actually true.
[02:58:14.858 --> 02:58:15.859]  That's actually true.
[02:58:15.859 --> 02:58:24.744]  So they've never had a vaccine for the common cold, which COVID's base virus is a common cold with four more viruses nested inside of it, a total bioweapon.
[02:58:24.744 --> 02:58:31.309]  But it's a bioweapon that spreads everywhere, never goes away, only kills the old and those that don't have the right supplements, the right vitamins, the right minerals.
[02:58:31.309 --> 02:58:38.854]  But it's nevertheless basically a nanotech virus tracker that then they can claim ownership of you if you have it.
[02:58:39.434 --> 02:58:39.594]  Okay.
[02:59:03.513 --> 02:59:04.553]  Edward Snowden.
[02:59:04.553 --> 02:59:06.454]  Snowden is doing just fine.
[02:59:06.454 --> 02:59:15.597]  He's asked that he be passed over and that Assange, who has been in solitary confinement for many years and who is almost losing his mind, be released.
[02:59:15.597 --> 02:59:22.539]  My friends, President Trump needs so desperately to do this to repudiate the entire corrupt system of Assange and others have exposed.
[02:59:22.539 --> 02:59:26.301]  But regardless, there's still time for him to do it and still time for him to take action.
[02:59:26.301 --> 02:59:27.761]  He's called for us to march on D.C.
[02:59:27.761 --> 02:59:28.641]  January 6th.
[02:59:28.641 --> 02:59:29.802]  He's also more and more
[02:59:30.442 --> 02:59:44.712]  Uh, preparing a resistance that CNN is so angry about, they call ragtag, that isn't giving up and is planning to challenge the, quote, electors in the House of Representatives that is federal law.
[02:59:44.712 --> 02:59:56.840]  They're trying out, this is some terrible thing, but Biden and the Democrats said they thought they would lose, there'd be a red mirage, that they were going to challenge right through until inauguration and then wouldn't even accept inauguration.
[02:59:56.840 --> 02:59:59.942]  They didn't have enough votes through the fraudulent ballots, the 80 million mail-ins.
[03:00:00.482 --> 03:00:05.184]  They froze it, stuffed the ballot boxes, and they believe won the election.
[03:00:05.184 --> 03:00:14.807]  Now even the committee in Georgia set out by the legislature to investigate crime says they found clear evidence of systematic election fraud for Joe Biden.
[03:00:14.807 --> 03:00:16.008]  Guess what's happening?
[03:00:16.008 --> 03:00:21.250]  Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are blocking members of the legislature and their findings.
[03:00:21.710 --> 03:00:30.097]  Just like they blocked the Senate committee that investigated over the weekend and found fraud when they made their statements, that too was blocked.
[03:00:30.097 --> 03:00:33.119]  This is the systematic cutting off of our communications.
[03:00:33.119 --> 03:00:34.740]  Who did Trump pardon?
[03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:37.863]  He pardoned different Republican congressmen.
[03:00:38.143 --> 03:00:38.783]  We're good to go.
[03:01:06.568 --> 03:01:12.131]  Crazed Piranha on PCP with rabies, famously.
[03:01:12.131 --> 03:01:16.173]  He cut the state funding to a corruption oversight board that she ran.
[03:01:16.173 --> 03:01:19.815]  He vetoed it and then they criminally indicted him.
[03:01:19.815 --> 03:01:21.196]  Lots of reasons to go after Rick Perry.
[03:01:21.196 --> 03:01:21.977]  He has a lot of problems.
[03:01:22.637 --> 03:01:22.777]  One of
[03:01:42.865 --> 03:01:43.485]  Edward Snowden.
[03:01:43.485 --> 03:01:55.889]  We need checks and balances on the police state, on the surveillance grid, on the system that was illegally spying on Trump and illegally trying to keep him from ever even getting into office and spying on him after he was in office.
[03:01:55.889 --> 03:02:03.991]  Judge Arpaio, Sheriff Arpaio, had a judge sentence him to jail without a jury trial claiming he was in contempt.
[03:02:03.991 --> 03:02:04.872]  Remember that?
[03:02:04.872 --> 03:02:09.333]  And Trump gave him a pardon and overrode what happened to Sheriff Arpaio.
[03:02:09.333 --> 03:02:12.074]  So again, Trump has a good history of standing up for people and not
[03:02:12.854 --> 03:02:12.934]  No.
[03:02:27.791 --> 03:02:28.071]  I don't know.
[03:02:50.282 --> 03:02:54.163]  Go to Bandot Video, and it's in the Banned Videos of Banned Videos section.
[03:02:54.163 --> 03:02:56.343]  So it's Bandot Video, that's the Banned Video section.
[03:02:56.343 --> 03:03:01.245]  You will find the Congressional testimony, the Senate testimony they're trying to censor, and so much more.
[03:03:01.245 --> 03:03:08.846]  And then you can share it to people and say, here is the proof of election fraud that the big multinational tech companies don't want you to know about.
[03:03:08.846 --> 03:03:10.667]  All right, please spread the word about the live feed.
[03:03:10.667 --> 03:03:12.487]  Your Paul Revere.
[03:03:12.487 --> 03:03:15.448]  Okay, this is John Rappaport here.
[03:03:15.448 --> 03:03:19.809]  The last hour for our weekly chat.
[03:03:21.656 --> 03:03:25.298]  Got about three minutes here coming up against the break.
[03:03:25.298 --> 03:03:33.443]  So the new vaccine, the COVID vaccine, there's a program called V-safe, which is a new program.
[03:03:33.443 --> 03:03:46.850]  And it's where people have an app on their cell phones and they report what the CDC is calling health impact events, which means unable to work or perform daily duties or to
[03:03:49.088 --> 03:03:53.491]  Need required health care from a doctor.
[03:03:53.491 --> 03:04:06.178]  So as of December 18, with 112,000 shots of the new vaccine being given, roughly 3,000 people had already reported health impact events.
[03:04:06.178 --> 03:04:06.738]  That's about 3%.
[03:04:06.738 --> 03:04:08.879]  That's gigantic.
[03:04:08.879 --> 03:04:18.725]  If you want to do the arithmetic, just imagine what happens when there's 100 million people vaccinated at 3% having serious adverse reactions.
[03:04:19.961 --> 03:04:35.688]  And that's only the beginning of the story because, first of all, we know from adverse drug events, medical drug events, let's say 10% are reported.
[03:04:35.688 --> 03:04:42.091]  So you can then multiply that figure of 3,000 from the vaccine to 30,000.
[03:04:42.091 --> 03:04:46.753]  That would be a conservative estimate.
[03:04:46.753 --> 03:04:49.254]  Those of you watching can see the chart on the screen there.
[03:04:50.037 --> 03:04:59.723]  The other factor is that since December 18th, this v-safe surveillance chart has apparently gone dark.
[03:04:59.723 --> 03:05:07.708]  I've been looking to see the updates, which until that time were daily, and I don't find any new ones.
[03:05:07.708 --> 03:05:12.592]  So this could very well be the CDC saying, oops, look what's happening here.
[03:05:12.592 --> 03:05:14.533]  We're seeing an alarming amount of
[03:05:15.251 --> 03:05:18.193]  Serious adverse reaction to the vaccine.
[03:05:18.193 --> 03:05:24.338]  We don't want to report this anymore and so we're going to go dark and go silent.
[03:05:24.338 --> 03:05:32.485]  So this is a an alert, a serious alert to people as this vaccine is rolling out.
[03:05:32.485 --> 03:05:36.608]  Again, as of December 18th, 112,000 reported adverse reactions with
[03:05:43.368 --> 03:05:48.689]  Sorry, 3,000 reported adverse reactions with 112,000 vaccines given.
[03:05:48.689 --> 03:05:52.330]  That's about 3%.
[03:05:52.330 --> 03:05:56.171]  That is a gross underestimate.
[03:05:56.171 --> 03:06:00.852]  Try multiplying that 3,000 by 10, you get 30,000.
[03:06:00.852 --> 03:06:07.954]  There's a lot of people that don't even know that there's this app.
[03:06:07.954 --> 03:06:11.535]  Wouldn't know how to load it on their phones if they knew about it.
[03:06:12.301 --> 03:06:18.183]  Or don't have cell phones, and those will never be reported.
[03:06:18.183 --> 03:06:21.885]  So we're looking at a gross underestimate here.
[03:06:21.885 --> 03:06:24.106]  And it's right in front of your eyeballs.
[03:06:24.106 --> 03:06:29.948]  It's there for anybody to see as to how dangerous this vaccine is as it comes out.
[03:06:29.948 --> 03:06:31.629]  Serious adverse events.
[03:06:32.367 --> 03:06:39.654]  Unable to work or to perform daily duties or needed medical care, which would include anaphylaxis.
[03:06:39.654 --> 03:06:41.596]  We will be back after the break.
[03:06:41.596 --> 03:06:43.118]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:06:43.118 --> 03:06:45.520]  The Resistance, not video.
[03:06:45.520 --> 03:06:47.923]  The Resistance, not video.
[03:06:47.923 --> 03:06:50.165]  The Resistance, not video.
[03:06:50.165 --> 03:06:52.347]  The Resistance, not video.
[03:06:52.347 --> 03:06:54.509]  The Resistance, not video.
[03:06:54.509 --> 03:06:56.131]  The Resistance, not video.
[03:06:57.330 --> 03:07:06.317]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Ban.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[03:07:06.317 --> 03:07:12.021]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[03:07:12.021 --> 03:07:16.264]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[03:07:16.264 --> 03:07:20.928]  But the new website is the Resistance.video.
[03:07:20.928 --> 03:07:22.849]  The Resistance.video.
[03:07:22.849 --> 03:07:26.772]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[03:07:27.292 --> 03:07:37.904]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video, and all of our videos, and all of our documentaries, and all the special reports, and all the suppressed information, is at TheResistance.Video.
[03:07:37.904 --> 03:07:38.805]  Share the link.
[03:07:38.805 --> 03:07:40.406]  TheResistance.Video.
[03:07:40.406 --> 03:07:41.547]  TheResistance.Video.
[03:07:42.640 --> 03:07:49.262]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.

[03:08:45.143 --> 03:08:58.847]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:58.847 --> 03:09:07.009]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:09:07.009 --> 03:09:10.410]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:10.410 --> 03:09:12.711]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:09:18.105 --> 03:09:26.152]  Okay, we're back after the break here.
[03:09:26.152 --> 03:09:36.542]  So you may not have heard about this story, but protesters actually stormed the Capitol in Argonne the other day.
[03:09:36.542 --> 03:09:41.566]  We're talking about anti-lockdown protesters.
[03:09:41.566 --> 03:09:44.969]  Stormed the Capitol where the legislature was in session.
[03:09:46.530 --> 03:09:51.172]  Broke into the building to register their protest.
[03:09:51.172 --> 03:09:52.433]  Lots of cops in there.
[03:09:52.433 --> 03:09:58.215]  Uh, standoff, scuffles.
[03:09:58.215 --> 03:10:00.696]  Apparently pepper spray was being used.
[03:10:00.696 --> 03:10:03.517]  Details are a little bit uncertain.
[03:10:03.517 --> 03:10:14.302]  One of the legislators came out of session and talked to the protesters inside the Capitol building in Oregon and said, I'm with you.
[03:10:15.342 --> 03:10:29.310]  Went back inside, addressed the legislature with his mask on and said, okay, now I'm going to take off this mask in violation of your rules.
[03:10:29.310 --> 03:10:39.236]  You can either show yourselves to be the cowards that you are and do nothing or the fascists that you want to be and arrest me.
[03:10:39.236 --> 03:10:43.418]  At which point he took off his mask and stood there silently for 30 seconds.
[03:10:44.758 --> 03:10:48.719]  And of course, nothing happened.
[03:10:48.719 --> 03:10:55.460]  So my point to lockdown politicians all over the world is.
[03:10:55.460 --> 03:11:09.324]  What did you expect was going to happen sooner or later as you keep imposing these lockdowns on more and more and more people, more and more vicious lockdowns, destroying more lives, more businesses, more economies.
[03:11:09.324 --> 03:11:10.844]  We know that's the op.
[03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:12.721]  That's the covert op.
[03:11:12.721 --> 03:11:13.842]  It isn't anything else.
[03:11:13.842 --> 03:11:14.823]  It's not the virus.
[03:11:14.823 --> 03:11:16.544]  It's not the pandemic.
[03:11:16.544 --> 03:11:18.085]  All of that is the cover story.
[03:11:18.085 --> 03:11:21.968]  We know what the routine is.
[03:11:21.968 --> 03:11:26.451]  So what did you expect was going to happen?
[03:11:26.451 --> 03:11:39.041]  When the lockdowns became so severe that people were completely crippled in their ability to earn a living, be free, walk outside, live their lives, etc, etc.
[03:11:40.632 --> 03:11:42.473]  What did you think was going to happen?
[03:11:42.473 --> 03:11:46.035]  And do you think this is the end of it?
[03:11:46.035 --> 03:11:49.838]  There are protests that have been sweeping across all of Europe.
[03:11:49.838 --> 03:11:55.401]  There are people that are pushing back who own businesses in the United States.
[03:11:55.401 --> 03:11:58.043]  These protests are getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[03:11:58.043 --> 03:12:08.369]  A lot of these people understand now the scientific fraud of Coke.
[03:12:08.369 --> 03:12:09.590]  Others who don't.
[03:12:10.717 --> 03:12:16.821]  Just understand that they're being destroyed by the lockdowns.
[03:12:16.821 --> 03:12:21.344]  So what choice do they have is the way they look at it.
[03:12:21.344 --> 03:12:40.216]  I mean, you can say all you want to about the deadly this and the deadly strain of that and all of this, but if at the same time you're locking down all these populations and keeping them indoors and destroying their ability to work and earn money, and then you throw a few pittance pennies at them,
[03:12:40.894 --> 03:12:48.237]  As recompense for their troubles, and you stand back and you think nothing is going to happen?
[03:12:48.237 --> 03:12:49.717]  Really?
[03:12:49.717 --> 03:12:54.979]  Is that your attitude?
[03:12:54.979 --> 03:13:00.401]  The resistance is not only growing, but it's taking different shapes.
[03:13:00.401 --> 03:13:03.882]  And again, I'm talking to you lockdown politicians.
[03:13:03.882 --> 03:13:08.404]  I'm just putting it right there on the table.
[03:13:08.404 --> 03:13:09.624]  What did you expect?
[03:13:10.086 --> 03:13:12.368]  Was going to happen.
[03:13:12.368 --> 03:13:35.090]  Did you really think that you could do this forever without any reaction whatsoever from the people whose lives you're destroying that you could keep clamping down and pressing down for months after you said it was just going to be a matter of weeks and then months and months and now it's getting on to a year and this is the darkest winter Biden is saying.
[03:13:35.823 --> 03:13:49.673]  England, which I'll have something to say about very quickly here, instituted new levels of lockdowns, and you really think that nothing is going to happen?
[03:13:49.673 --> 03:14:01.501]  The resistance is taking all kinds of shapes, all manner of shapes, that are out of your control, completely out of your control.
[03:14:04.494 --> 03:14:08.837]  So now what do we have in England?
[03:14:08.837 --> 03:14:15.082]  We have this baloney about a new mutant strain of the virus.
[03:14:15.082 --> 03:14:16.663]  A new mutant strain.
[03:14:16.663 --> 03:14:18.084]  A new mutant strain.
[03:14:18.084 --> 03:14:19.205]  A new mutant strain.
[03:14:19.205 --> 03:14:23.228]  And it's being publicized up to the sky and whatever, whatever.
[03:14:23.228 --> 03:14:28.332]  I've been showing evidence for the last nine months that there isn't even a first strain of the virus.
[03:14:28.332 --> 03:14:30.133]  But now there's a new mutant strain.
[03:14:30.133 --> 03:14:31.854]  Oh yeah, big alarm.
[03:14:31.854 --> 03:14:33.956]  It's so scary, fantastically scary.
[03:14:34.591 --> 03:14:37.132]  Drudge, oh yeah, keeps running headlines.
[03:14:37.132 --> 03:14:39.792]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[03:14:39.792 --> 03:14:48.675]  And on that basis, a new tier of level four lockdown, Boris Johnson is declaring in the UK.
[03:14:48.675 --> 03:14:50.955]  Cancel Christmas, forget the whole thing.
[03:14:50.955 --> 03:14:53.156]  Nobody goes, nobody moves.
[03:14:53.156 --> 03:14:57.457]  Lockdown, lockdown, lockdown, lockdown, lockdown.
[03:14:57.457 --> 03:15:01.418]  So where are they getting their data from about this new strain that is supposedly
[03:15:03.294 --> 03:15:07.455]  70% more contagious than the original strain of the virus?
[03:15:07.455 --> 03:15:19.879]  Well, it's yet another report from the Imperial College of London, which I've covered on this show and in articles at NoMoreFakeNews for months now.
[03:15:19.879 --> 03:15:24.840]  But if you read the actual report from the Imperial College, it states
[03:15:25.580 --> 03:15:38.925]  That it's really too early to tell if this computer prediction about the new strain 70% more contagious and dangerous than the old strain is really true.
[03:15:38.925 --> 03:15:40.606]  It's too early to tell.
[03:15:40.606 --> 03:15:42.067]  We don't really know.
[03:15:42.067 --> 03:15:43.807]  That's what they're saying.
[03:15:43.807 --> 03:15:45.768]  But it doesn't matter to Boris Johnson.
[03:15:45.768 --> 03:15:49.570]  He's acting anyway on this information.
[03:15:49.570 --> 03:15:54.772]  And who is the face on television that is promoting
[03:15:55.319 --> 03:16:01.922]  This criminal non-science and the lockdowns right now.
[03:16:01.922 --> 03:16:08.245]  Who is being the spokesman for all of this crime?
[03:16:08.245 --> 03:16:16.029]  Conspiratorial crime by the British UK mob boss Boris Johnson.
[03:16:16.029 --> 03:16:16.569]  Why?
[03:16:16.569 --> 03:16:17.489]  Guess who?
[03:16:17.489 --> 03:16:19.350]  It's Neil Ferguson.
[03:16:19.350 --> 03:16:25.073]  Neil Ferguson, the disgraced and failed computer modeler
[03:16:25.589 --> 03:16:52.696]  Who made the first original prediction about 500,000 deaths in the UK by this past summer and 2 million in the US by this past summer that directly influenced Boris Johnson and Trump to declare states of emergency and reverse their positions that the economy had to be left open and instead supported closing and shutting down the economy.
[03:16:53.297 --> 03:17:17.599]  That guy, that failed modeler, Neil Ferguson, who had, by the way, carried on an affair with his married mistress during the lockdowns that he helped perpetuate, was caught in the act and resigned his government position and slunk off into the darkness.
[03:17:17.599 --> 03:17:18.620]  He's back!
[03:17:18.620 --> 03:17:19.561]  He's on television!
[03:17:20.686 --> 03:17:25.591]  The British people are sitting there watching this.
[03:17:25.591 --> 03:17:33.778]  The British politicians and the planners are rubbing the noses of the public into the new destructive explosive lockdowns.
[03:17:33.778 --> 03:17:37.221]  What do they expect is going to happen?
[03:17:37.221 --> 03:17:37.742]  Stay with us.
[03:17:37.742 --> 03:17:39.063]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:17:41.016 --> 03:17:56.150]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold, you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:57.251]  Well, that's where we are in the year 2020.
[03:17:58.252 --> 03:18:02.216]  Global government, the United Nations, all these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it.
[03:18:02.216 --> 03:18:09.743]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19.
[03:18:09.743 --> 03:18:12.146]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[03:18:12.146 --> 03:18:13.527]  Think about how insane that is.
[03:18:13.527 --> 03:18:15.469]  Oh, and big tech's got to track you.
[03:18:15.469 --> 03:18:16.150]  They've got to trace you.
[03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:17.030]  They've got to control you.
[03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:19.193]  You've got to have apps leave your house.
[03:18:19.193 --> 03:18:19.573]  Why?
[03:18:19.573 --> 03:18:22.376]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you because
[03:18:23.076 --> 03:18:29.859]  My God, this thing has one-tenth of one percent chance of killing you if you're debilitated by cancer or a heart attack.
[03:18:29.859 --> 03:18:31.499]  This is their takeover.
[03:18:31.499 --> 03:18:33.820]  Imagine on America's death certificate.
[03:18:33.820 --> 03:18:36.341]  Killed by the fear of the common cold.
[03:18:36.341 --> 03:18:37.462]  Yeah, that's fear-mongering.
[03:18:37.462 --> 03:18:38.182]  That's mind control.
[03:18:40.011 --> 03:18:43.072]  Winter Sun has been sold out for months.
[03:18:43.072 --> 03:18:44.132]  It's now back in stock.
[03:18:44.132 --> 03:18:47.633]  It's the highest quality vitamin D3 you're going to find anywhere.
[03:18:47.633 --> 03:18:52.935]  You take it under the tongue for maximum absorption or just put it in your mouth and drink it down.
[03:18:52.935 --> 03:18:58.257]  It's absolutely an essential vitamin, meaning if you don't have it and you have a deficiency from it, you will die.
[03:18:58.857 --> 03:19:00.298]  The system doesn't want you to know this.
[03:19:00.298 --> 03:19:07.645]  And they don't want you to know that they've lowered the allowance of what they claim you need every day to a level that makes you very, very sickly and easy to control.
[03:19:07.645 --> 03:19:11.709]  But now we have a winner's sum of vitamin D3 and vitamin K that helps it upload better.
[03:19:11.709 --> 03:19:15.092]  And it's also excellent for your immune system at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:19:15.452 --> 03:19:16.833]  It's sold out for months.
[03:19:16.833 --> 03:19:21.257]  I'm still gonna sell it at 50% off because everyone needs it.
[03:19:21.257 --> 03:19:27.763]  Get it for yourself, get it for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors, especially folks that work indoors and don't get any sun.

[03:19:40.157 --> 03:19:42.540]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:42.540 --> 03:19:47.545]  Just in time for Christmas, one of our best sellers, sold out for months, is now back in stock, Living Defense.
[03:19:47.545 --> 03:19:50.108]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is a next-level probiotic.
[03:19:50.108 --> 03:19:51.810]  It's not a bacteria that reads your gut.
[03:19:51.810 --> 03:19:59.058]  It's a whole bunch of known herbalist ingredients that are organic, that are documented historically to do amazing things for the health of your gut.
[03:19:59.158 --> 03:20:07.760]  What is in Living Defense Back in Stock, the ultimate stocking stuffer, the ultimate thing to put under the Christmas tree this year, and a great New Year's resolution as well.
[03:20:07.760 --> 03:20:20.723]  It's got the Grapefruit Seed Extract, it's got the Grape Seed Extract, it's got Organic Black Walnut Leaf and Stem that the regular black walnut, when it's green, from the hull, Organic Olive Leaf, Organic Neem Leaf, Organic Ginger Root, and so much more.
[03:20:20.723 --> 03:20:22.304]  We're really proud of this formula.
[03:20:22.304 --> 03:20:23.084]  It's groundbreaking.
[03:20:23.084 --> 03:20:24.084]  It's been sold out for months.
[03:20:24.284 --> 03:20:25.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:21:09.132 --> 03:21:27.242]  Okay, so just before the break I was talking about Neil Ferguson, the failed computer modeler who is now the face of the new level of lockdowns in UK.
[03:21:27.242 --> 03:21:28.563]  So what do we know about this guy?
[03:21:29.332 --> 03:21:38.656]  Well, we know that he made ridiculous, absurd, insane criminal predictions about COVID deaths that led to the lockdowns back in March.
[03:21:38.656 --> 03:21:44.979]  But before that, in 2005, he made a prediction about bird flu.
[03:21:44.979 --> 03:21:50.142]  He said it could kill up to 200 million people.
[03:21:50.142 --> 03:21:54.384]  The final official tally was several hundred.
[03:21:54.384 --> 03:21:55.364]  Several hundred.
[03:21:56.413 --> 03:22:11.862]  In 2001, he made a prediction about Mad Cow in Britain that led to billions of dollars of losses and millions of killed animals in England said, untold, you know, huge numbers of people could die from it.
[03:22:11.862 --> 03:22:16.045]  Again, official statistics at the end, several hundred.
[03:22:16.045 --> 03:22:18.886]  Same with swine flu in 2009.
[03:22:18.886 --> 03:22:22.528]  So this guy has been a failed computer modeler from the beginning.
[03:22:22.528 --> 03:22:25.070]  Has a long, long history.
[03:22:25.629 --> 03:22:29.352]  So, why is anybody listening to him?
[03:22:29.352 --> 03:22:30.693]  Why do people obey him?
[03:22:30.693 --> 03:22:32.395]  Why is he on television?
[03:22:32.395 --> 03:22:34.577]  Why does he influence governments?
[03:22:34.577 --> 03:22:37.399]  Because he's bankrolled by Bill Gates.
[03:22:37.399 --> 03:22:44.965]  Because his institute at the Imperial College of London is bankrolled by Bill Gates at tens of millions every year.
[03:22:44.965 --> 03:22:50.030]  He is the guy who is the mouthpiece for Bill Gates.
[03:22:50.543 --> 03:22:51.784]  Who wants the lockdowns?
[03:22:51.784 --> 03:22:52.825]  Who wants the fear?
[03:22:52.825 --> 03:22:54.446]  Who wants the terror?
[03:22:54.446 --> 03:23:06.396]  Who wants COVID, COVID, COVID fraud broadcast all over the world with dire predictions so that the vaccine, which is now released, will come true.
[03:23:06.396 --> 03:23:08.617]  That's been the plan all along.
[03:23:08.617 --> 03:23:15.243]  And Neil Ferguson is one of the major mouthpieces for the whole thing.
[03:23:15.243 --> 03:23:17.444]  Okay.
[03:23:17.444 --> 03:23:19.266]  So I want to ask a couple of questions now.
[03:23:21.997 --> 03:23:28.040]  Why do political officials break their own COVID rules?
[03:23:28.040 --> 03:23:29.400]  Politicians.
[03:23:29.400 --> 03:23:31.822]  We've seen this with Deborah Birx.
[03:23:31.822 --> 03:23:38.245]  The Coronavirus White House Task Force traveled on Thanksgiving after she warned everybody not to do it.
[03:23:38.245 --> 03:23:45.628]  Gavin Newsom, the presidential would-be, delusional, from California.
[03:23:46.832 --> 03:23:53.514]  Boo did the same thing on Thanksgiving and then he was caught dining indoors without a mask for 12 people.
[03:23:53.514 --> 03:23:59.135]  And we've had other examples along the way where politicians say, no, no, no, don't do this.
[03:23:59.135 --> 03:23:59.775]  Don't do this.
[03:23:59.775 --> 03:24:00.335]  Don't do this.
[03:24:00.335 --> 03:24:02.536]  You got to block down, stay indoors and all this.
[03:24:02.536 --> 03:24:08.077]  And then they go out and they break their own rules.
[03:24:08.077 --> 03:24:09.598]  Why?
[03:24:09.598 --> 03:24:15.039]  Well, reasons have been given for this because they think they're above the law.
[03:24:15.839 --> 03:24:20.983]  Because they want to thumb their noses at the public, etc., etc.
[03:24:20.983 --> 03:24:25.847]  Yes, no doubt, no doubt, these reasons are true, so on.
[03:24:25.847 --> 03:24:34.994]  But there's another reason that's staring us in the face, and I'll frame it as another question.
[03:24:34.994 --> 03:24:45.082]  If these politicians were actually concerned about, quote, the virus in terms of their own health,
[03:24:46.553 --> 03:24:50.156]  Would they go out and break their own rules?
[03:24:50.156 --> 03:24:58.543]  Would they be dining out indoors with people not of their own household and not wearing masks?
[03:24:58.543 --> 03:25:10.453]  Would they do that if they were truly concerned for their own health vis-a-vis this virus?
[03:25:10.453 --> 03:25:13.836]  No.
[03:25:13.836 --> 03:25:14.917]  What does that lead us to?
[03:25:16.192 --> 03:25:22.074]  That there are a number of politicians who know that this is no threat.
[03:25:22.074 --> 03:25:24.794]  Who know that the pandemic is a fraud.
[03:25:24.794 --> 03:25:26.655]  Who know it's a fake.
[03:25:26.655 --> 03:25:31.656]  Who know that they are not personally in danger for breaking all their own rules.
[03:25:31.656 --> 03:25:35.137]  Who know that they can go out and do anything they want to.
[03:25:35.137 --> 03:25:41.939]  They can go to Mexico and sit in a condo and announce a lockdown in Texas.
[03:25:41.939 --> 03:25:44.300]  They can do whatever they want to because they know
[03:25:45.814 --> 03:25:50.557]  That the pandemic is a fraud.
[03:25:50.557 --> 03:25:53.459]  Now that's a very interesting conclusion.
[03:25:53.459 --> 03:25:58.301]  It's a true conclusion.
[03:25:58.301 --> 03:26:08.768]  So this leads us to understand that we're not dealing here with a secret conspiracy with 12 guys in a room that's sealed off and that's it.
[03:26:08.768 --> 03:26:10.008]  No, no, no.
[03:26:10.008 --> 03:26:12.650]  We're talking about something much wider than that.
[03:26:13.903 --> 03:26:33.672]  Twelve guys, including Bill Gates, may have dreamed up the whole idea 20 years ago, but the people who maintain the fake pandemic, who administer it, who give the orders for the lockdowns, who are the mouthpieces, they know.
[03:26:33.672 --> 03:26:37.034]  They know that it's a fraud, that it is no danger.
[03:26:37.034 --> 03:26:39.695]  They understand that.
[03:26:39.695 --> 03:26:43.217]  So we could rightfully call it an open secret.
[03:26:47.502 --> 03:26:54.408]  Shared by many, but certainly not broadcast by those many to you and me.
[03:26:54.408 --> 03:26:57.611]  No, no, no, no.
[03:26:57.611 --> 03:26:58.933]  Let's not stop there.
[03:26:58.933 --> 03:27:04.538]  Let's go to another level of people who would be sharing this secret.
[03:27:04.538 --> 03:27:08.081]  This open secret that the pandemic is a fraud.
[03:27:08.081 --> 03:27:09.963]  Government scientists and doctors.
[03:27:11.477 --> 03:27:16.540]  Many of them understand that this is a total fraud from a scientific point of view.
[03:27:16.540 --> 03:27:20.222]  They know that the PCR test is a complete fraud.
[03:27:20.222 --> 03:27:21.102]  It's worthless.
[03:27:21.102 --> 03:27:22.623]  It's valueless.
[03:27:22.623 --> 03:27:28.186]  It doesn't really identify a virus at all, any virus.
[03:27:28.186 --> 03:27:39.933]  And yet it is used to churn out false positive results like a fire hose, jack up the fake case numbers that lead to the lockdowns,
[03:27:41.906 --> 03:27:50.210]  They understand all of this and more, and yet they say nothing either.
[03:27:50.210 --> 03:27:56.594]  They remain silent, just like the politicians do.
[03:27:56.594 --> 03:28:05.378]  So that widens the realm of this shared secret that the pandemic is a fraud.
[03:28:05.378 --> 03:28:07.119]  Well, let's take it one step further.
[03:28:08.706 --> 03:28:14.910]  What about all of the labs in the world, of which there are many, that are actually doing the PCR tests?
[03:28:14.910 --> 03:28:24.656]  They're running all of these tests, as I've documented on the show and in numerous articles at my site.
[03:28:24.656 --> 03:28:34.582]  The test is done in what's called cycles, amplifying the size of the tiny portion of the test sample taken from the patient.
[03:28:36.112 --> 03:28:37.113]  It's well known.
[03:28:37.113 --> 03:28:48.804]  In fact, Fauci readily asserted this, that if you do the tests at more or at up to 35 cycles or above, it's meaningless.
[03:28:48.804 --> 03:28:50.425]  It means nothing whatsoever.
[03:28:50.425 --> 03:28:58.072]  And yet, public health agencies like the CDC and the FDA recommend doing it at up to 40 cycles.
[03:28:58.072 --> 03:28:59.874]  And that's the way labs are doing it.
[03:29:00.549 --> 03:29:03.650]  Which turns out false positives all the time.
[03:29:03.650 --> 03:29:08.172]  Jacks up the case numbers, leads to the lockdowns.
[03:29:08.172 --> 03:29:19.717]  Well, the PCR techs in these labs all over the world understand exactly what they're doing every day in the lab.
[03:29:19.717 --> 03:29:24.899]  They're complicit in the crime of centuries.
[03:29:24.899 --> 03:29:25.519]  They know.
[03:29:26.886 --> 03:29:33.071]  They're the technical people who understand everything about the test.
[03:29:33.071 --> 03:29:36.834]  So they know that the pandemic is a fraud too.
[03:29:36.834 --> 03:29:40.076]  And they're not saying anything about it.
[03:29:40.076 --> 03:29:55.408]  Has any PR tech currently working in a lab stepping forward and saying, I'm blowing the whistle on the whole fraud and I'm urging my fellow PCR techs in these labs to do the same?
[03:29:55.408 --> 03:29:55.608]  No.
[03:29:57.958 --> 03:30:00.399]  More conspiracy of silence.
[03:30:00.399 --> 03:30:12.204]  The PR techs, the government scientists and doctors, some of the politicians, many of the politicians who know that the whole thing is a total fraud.
[03:30:12.204 --> 03:30:17.426]  This sheds a whole different light on what's going on here.
[03:30:17.426 --> 03:30:22.708]  It's not just, you know, a few guys in a little room somewhere.
[03:30:22.708 --> 03:30:26.430]  This is widely held knowledge kept from the public
[03:30:27.048 --> 03:30:36.016]  By a vast conspiracy of silence based on fear, based on pride, blackmail, threats.
[03:30:36.016 --> 03:30:39.359]  It's dangerous.
[03:30:39.359 --> 03:30:41.041]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[03:30:41.041 --> 03:30:42.482]  Thank you for holding.
[03:30:42.482 --> 03:30:43.143]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:30:43.939 --> 03:30:45.360]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:46.600]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[03:30:46.600 --> 03:30:47.321]  How are you?
[03:30:47.321 --> 03:30:48.121]  I love you, man.
[03:30:48.121 --> 03:30:50.442]  I want to make a quick plug.
[03:30:50.442 --> 03:30:52.323]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[03:30:52.323 --> 03:31:08.791]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[03:31:09.426 --> 03:31:14.829]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[03:31:14.829 --> 03:31:26.595]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive product in them.
[03:31:26.595 --> 03:31:28.336]  It's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[03:31:28.336 --> 03:31:33.059]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[03:31:33.059 --> 03:31:34.500]  So thanks for the plug.
[03:31:40.499 --> 03:31:47.821]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy or technocrats.
[03:31:47.821 --> 03:31:59.224]  You'll get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments.
[03:31:59.964 --> 03:32:02.105]  But they want businessman technocrats over it.
[03:32:02.105 --> 03:32:04.186]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[03:32:04.186 --> 03:32:09.388]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[03:32:09.388 --> 03:32:12.109]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[03:32:13.203 --> 03:32:18.366]  He believes, because he's hidden it to blame you, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[03:32:18.366 --> 03:32:20.507]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[03:32:20.507 --> 03:32:21.928]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[03:32:21.928 --> 03:32:26.450]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[03:32:26.450 --> 03:32:29.992]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism, in his own words.
[03:32:29.992 --> 03:32:35.415]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you, before you take those shots.
[03:32:35.415 --> 03:32:37.877]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[03:32:41.693 --> 03:32:44.074]  The post-industrial world.
[03:32:44.074 --> 03:32:53.336]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[03:32:53.336 --> 03:32:57.857]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[03:32:57.857 --> 03:33:03.698]  Klaus Schwab, the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[03:33:06.559 --> 03:33:09.582]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[03:33:09.582 --> 03:33:12.705]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[03:33:12.705 --> 03:33:14.667]  It is making the population poor.
[03:33:14.667 --> 03:33:20.592]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[03:33:20.592 --> 03:33:23.895]  They're destroying civilization, rebuilding it, and they're dystopic.
[03:33:24.776 --> 03:33:26.297]  We're good to go.
[03:33:41.829 --> 03:33:44.230]  TheResistance.video.

[03:33:46.650 --> 03:33:48.871]  TheResistance.video.
[03:33:48.871 --> 03:33:51.031]  TheResistance.video.
[03:33:51.031 --> 03:33:53.212]  TheResistance.video.
[03:33:53.212 --> 03:33:56.072]  TheResistance.video.
[03:33:56.072 --> 03:33:58.053]  InfoWars.com.
[03:33:58.053 --> 03:34:00.013]  NewsWars.com.
[03:34:00.013 --> 03:34:01.554]  Ban.video.
[03:34:01.554 --> 03:34:05.035]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[03:34:05.035 --> 03:34:10.016]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[03:34:11.316 --> 03:34:12.336]  We're good to go.
[03:34:43.115 --> 03:35:00.509]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:35:00.509 --> 03:35:04.172]  Okay, John Rappaport here for the last segment here in this hour.
[03:35:04.172 --> 03:35:06.654]  As I was talking before the break,
[03:35:08.829 --> 03:35:20.576]  It's an open secret that the pandemic is a fraud and it's shared in a conspiracy of silence based on fear, based on intimidation by many people.
[03:35:20.576 --> 03:35:32.302]  Politicians, government scientists and doctors, people who work in labs and are doing the fake fraudulent PR, PCR test, the techs in these labs.
[03:35:32.302 --> 03:35:37.505]  You can fill out your own list of people who understand that this whole thing is a fraud.
[03:35:40.982 --> 03:35:50.288]  So when you look at this amazing thing, this landscape of a conspiracy of silence, what does it remind you of?
[03:35:50.288 --> 03:36:08.199]  What it reminds you of, or should, is the massive bureaucracies of Nazi Germany, USSR, China, North Korea, where people are
[03:36:08.860 --> 03:36:12.542]  Receiving orders, passing along those orders.
[03:36:12.542 --> 03:36:13.683]  They're not thinking.
[03:36:13.683 --> 03:36:16.164]  They're just looking at this.
[03:36:16.164 --> 03:36:17.525]  Okay, here's what I'm getting.
[03:36:17.525 --> 03:36:19.185]  This is what I'm transferring.
[03:36:19.185 --> 03:36:22.667]  This is what they want me to do now, so I do it.
[03:36:22.667 --> 03:36:25.409]  This is what I have to tell these people to do.
[03:36:25.409 --> 03:36:28.170]  This is what I'm supposed to do.
[03:36:28.170 --> 03:36:37.795]  The faceless bureaucracies that are massive, that are maintaining and sustaining and administering
[03:36:38.462 --> 03:36:46.504]  The fake and fraudulent pandemic, the lockdowns, the restrictions, the vaccinations, the whole nine yards.
[03:36:46.504 --> 03:36:52.686]  Don't you think there are people in the military who get these shots all the time?
[03:36:52.686 --> 03:36:58.048]  Where they have a huge number of unreported adverse reactions, I'm sure.
[03:36:59.363 --> 03:37:07.308]  That are now supposed to be administering the COVID vaccinations who know how dangerous this is and are saying nothing.
[03:37:07.308 --> 03:37:15.453]  That's another group of people you can add to the list of those who understand that this whole thing is a fraud.
[03:37:15.453 --> 03:37:29.141]  In these situations you have the faceless bureaucracies of obedience and interconnection that are absolutely necessary to maintaining the structure
[03:37:29.577 --> 03:37:35.560]  of tyranny against which we are resisting.
[03:37:35.560 --> 03:37:37.381]  That's the picture.
[03:37:37.381 --> 03:37:42.564]  That's the picture that you need to understand and see.
[03:37:42.564 --> 03:37:45.246]  And there will be defections.
[03:37:45.246 --> 03:37:49.228]  There are people who have already opted out of that bureaucracy.
[03:37:49.228 --> 03:37:54.911]  There are people who have quietly opted out and retired and left and resigned.
[03:37:55.646 --> 03:37:57.626]  And occasionally one is speaking up.
[03:37:57.626 --> 03:38:09.129]  There will be more as the severity of these lockdowns, which is the real aim here, the destruction of Phase 1 of the New World Order, proceeds.
[03:38:09.129 --> 03:38:13.809]  So understand all of this.
[03:38:13.809 --> 03:38:21.431]  So in the few minutes remaining, I want to give you some deep background on this.
[03:38:21.431 --> 03:38:22.171]  I.G.
[03:38:22.171 --> 03:38:22.631]  Farben.
[03:38:24.062 --> 03:38:33.626]  IG Farben was, at the outbreak of World War II, a German cartel, chemical cartel, pharmaceutical cartel.
[03:38:33.626 --> 03:38:37.067]  It was instrumental in putting Hitler over the top in 1933.
[03:38:37.067 --> 03:38:43.150]  They green-lighted the rise of Hitler.
[03:38:43.150 --> 03:38:50.753]  To give you a sense of how huge this cartel was at the outbreak of World War II, not only did it have
[03:38:51.420 --> 03:38:56.823]  A significant alliance with Standard Oil, Rockefeller.
[03:38:56.823 --> 03:39:10.692]  But in the early phases of World War II, a government employee named Josiah Dubois was sent on a mission to Guatemala to look into the influence of IG Farben.
[03:39:10.692 --> 03:39:17.096]  Dubois later wrote a book, which you can look for, called The Devil's Chemists, about IG Farben.
[03:39:17.975 --> 03:39:29.624]  He came back from Guatemala and he said, as far as I can see, Guatemala is a wholly owned subsidiary of IG Farben.
[03:39:29.624 --> 03:39:38.710]  So, after World War II and the defeat of Germany, a Plan B was organized.
[03:39:38.710 --> 03:39:46.316]  It had many dimensions, including the European Common Market, the eventual rise of the European Commission,
[03:39:46.914 --> 03:39:51.698]  And the European Union, war by other means.
[03:39:51.698 --> 03:40:14.277]  But one of the things that happened in Germany was that at the Nuremberg trials, the division that was headed up by Telfer Taylor, who was chief prosecutor against German corporate leaders, failed to produce the degree and level of conviction that they were looking for, because they were trying to show
[03:40:15.191 --> 03:40:23.498]  That these enablers of the Nazi regime were just as guilty as the SS or anybody else in Germany.
[03:40:23.498 --> 03:40:27.100]  But the sentences handed out were generally fairly light.
[03:40:27.100 --> 03:40:43.133]  For example, Fritz Termir, who had been the very high-ranking science executive on the board of IG Farben, was tried for mass murder and slavery.
[03:40:44.053 --> 03:41:00.179]  Found guilty and received a seven-year sentence, which was partially commuted, and he eventually became a major pharmaceutical executive in Germany post-World War II.
[03:41:00.179 --> 03:41:13.344]  The theme under cover, so to speak, in post-World War Europe and in other countries was rebuilding the pharmaceutical empire.
[03:41:14.008 --> 03:41:25.073]  To become war on the people by other means, by chemical, by vaccine, by drug.
[03:41:25.073 --> 03:41:35.898]  I have often cited the most mainstream study I would say that's ever been done on the devastation caused by pharmaceuticals.
[03:41:36.718 --> 03:41:51.604]  In the United States, July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Barbara Starfield, who at the time was a revered public health expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.
[03:41:51.604 --> 03:42:05.050]  She found that every year in the U.S., the medical system kills 100,000, 106,000 people from the correct administration of FDA approved pharmaceutical drugs.
[03:42:06.059 --> 03:42:21.568]  I interviewed her about a year before her death in 2009 and she told me that was a conservative estimate and that other studies and analyses done since her 2000 study have shown higher figures.
[03:42:21.568 --> 03:42:24.390]  Yes, some much higher figures.
[03:42:24.390 --> 03:42:34.336]  But even that, 106,000 people killed by correct administration of FDA-approved pharmaceutical drugs in the U.S.
[03:42:35.362 --> 03:42:37.284]  Only in the U.S.
[03:42:37.284 --> 03:42:48.132]  That comes out to a million killings per decade from pharmaceutical drugs, not including vaccines.
[03:42:48.132 --> 03:42:50.894]  Now, the FDA knows this.
[03:42:50.894 --> 03:42:55.157]  They approved the drugs in the first place as safe and effective.
[03:42:55.157 --> 03:42:57.299]  The medical journals know this.
[03:42:57.299 --> 03:43:02.303]  They published the studies that claim that the drugs were safe, effective, and brilliant.
[03:43:03.123 --> 03:43:06.724]  The drugs that later killed all these people.
[03:43:06.724 --> 03:43:10.905]  The editors of the medical journals know this.
[03:43:10.905 --> 03:43:12.305]  The FDA knows this.
[03:43:12.305 --> 03:43:15.766]  The CDC knows this.
[03:43:15.766 --> 03:43:18.846]  All kinds of people know this, and yet nothing is ever done.
[03:43:18.846 --> 03:43:30.049]  I asked Starfield, had she ever been contacted by the government to consult them on trying to remedy this genocidal assault by medical drugs on the public?
[03:43:30.049 --> 03:43:31.729]  She said, no, absolutely not.
[03:43:33.462 --> 03:43:41.328]  I asked her whether she was aware of any overall effort to remedy this horrendous tragedy of killing.
[03:43:41.328 --> 03:43:45.212]  She said no.
[03:43:45.212 --> 03:43:54.399]  What emerged out of World War II and IG Farben was a new form of killing, a new killing machine, war by other means.
[03:43:54.399 --> 03:44:01.825]  And we've seen it come to fruition slowly, gradually, by the declaration of fake epidemics
[03:44:03.007 --> 03:44:22.915]  One after another that have never taken hold, but each one has promoted vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, toxic drug, toxic drug, toxic drug, until finally this plan caught hold, aided by the Chinese regime.
[03:44:22.915 --> 03:44:25.016]  The lockdowns.
[03:44:25.016 --> 03:44:27.397]  The lockdowns, the lockdowns, the lockdowns.
[03:44:27.397 --> 03:44:31.919]  The treatment with toxic medical drugs like Remdesivir, antivirals.
[03:44:32.563 --> 03:44:40.169]  The use of ventilators and heavy sedation to kill the elderly and frail.
[03:44:40.169 --> 03:44:47.876]  And now the vaccine, which I started out by saying, look, here's the reactions.
[03:44:47.876 --> 03:44:53.741]  3,000 reactions reported so far, only a fraction of the real number.
[03:44:53.741 --> 03:45:01.347]  After only 112,000 shots have been given and the CDC goes dark and doesn't report any more since
[03:45:01.789 --> 03:45:05.051]  December 18th, that I can find.
[03:45:05.051 --> 03:45:10.374]  This is war against you, against me, against all of us by other means.
[03:45:10.374 --> 03:45:12.355]  The Plan B people, as I call them.
[03:45:12.355 --> 03:45:13.856]  The killing machine.
[03:45:13.856 --> 03:45:17.278]  The pharmaceutical death machine.
[03:45:17.278 --> 03:45:20.780]  That's the deep background behind all of this.
[03:45:20.780 --> 03:45:23.282]  The takeover of the New World Order.
[03:45:23.282 --> 03:45:26.404]  John Rappaport, see you again, next time.
