[00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:15.133]  The year is 2020, and we are watching a foreign, multinational, communist Chinese takeover of the United States take place.
[00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:24.877]  And we are here in the really sacred hollows of one of the most important and historical monuments in the United States, the Lincoln Memorial.
[00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:28.739]  Now, why is the Lincoln Memorial so incredibly important?
[00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.121]  Because it was, back at that time,
[00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.695]  In the 1860s, the powerful multinational forces tried to split the United States up.
[00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.997]  Now, some would call Lincoln a tyrant.
[00:00:40.017 --> 00:00:41.399]  Others would call him a hero.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:51.288]  But it's a fact that he was fighting against multinational forces, the British namely, who had already attempted to break this country up in the War of 1812 and later against Andrew Jackson.
[00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.631]  That's why I'm starting this broadcast today from D.C.
[00:00:55.212 --> 00:00:57.934]  to bring into context the historic moment we're in.
[00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:01.239]  The country is fighting for its life.
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.384]  And anyone that denies that is lying to you.
[00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:06.947]  Joe Biden is not a legitimate president.
[00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:08.309]  He's not a legitimate president-elect.
[00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.918]  Even if Joe Biden had won this election fair and square, which he hasn't, the fraud's overwhelming, he is a communist Chinese agent.
[00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:20.928]  Where there was no evidence of Trump with the Russians, there is total evidence of Joe Biden and the Communist Chinese and the Russians.
[00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:28.830]  If Donald Trump had done 1% of what Joe Biden has done with foreign powers to sell out the entrance of this country, I would say that Donald Trump should be in prison.
[00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.190]  But Donald Trump has done absolutely none of it.
[00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:33.971]  That's why we stand here.
[00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:44.049]  And use this as a very powerful illustration of the fact that our country is not on the verge of a civil war.
[00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:49.973]  It is in the midst of a civil war and the factions against America and against Trump are globalist.
[00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:54.376]  So this is not like the Southerners who had some arguments, but were probably in the wrong in many ways.
[00:01:55.016 --> 00:02:04.823]  This is communist Chinese backed, this revolution against America with 3 million innocent Muslims in death camps, a million Christians and a million Buddhists.
[00:02:05.953 --> 00:02:11.657]  And that is the entire leftist model of the entire planet with the cashless society, the social credit score, and all the rest of it.
[00:02:11.937 --> 00:02:14.719]  So I'm going to give you a little bit of a tour around D.C.
[00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:23.904]  in the first few segments and break the latest news and huge developments and play some clips of the big speeches that happened here yesterday in the second Million Maga march that was very successful.
[00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:25.986]  And then Harris D. Smith is going to be taking over.
[00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:33.651]  But again, I want to encourage you all on this live Sunday transmission to realize history is happening now, and if you acquiesce to this takeover,
[00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:35.571]  You have absolutely no future.
[00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:37.192]  This isn't like past elections.
[00:02:37.552 --> 00:02:39.413]  This isn't like past crises this country faced.
[00:02:39.873 --> 00:02:51.177]  It's a greater threat than what we had in the Civil War because at least the southern and northern cultures came out of the same country and were brothers and were sisters and were fathers and mothers and it was brother against brother sometimes.
[00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:54.859]  But it was two cultures that were very similar who had major disagreements.
[00:02:56.087 --> 00:03:02.831]  With the globalist takeover and the globalist model, it is outside multinational forces that are doing this and trying to destroy our country.
[00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:07.173]  And so that's why we're here pointing this out.
[00:03:07.534 --> 00:03:10.876]  That's why we're here trying to get people to realize that we are in the midst
[00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:12.557]  A lot of patriots in here!
[00:03:52.654 --> 00:04:00.762]  Our forebearers did not have separation of church and state as they spin it.
[00:04:01.162 --> 00:04:05.627]  It means the state has no jurisdiction over any of us.
[00:04:08.843 --> 00:04:12.426]  Our relationship with God is sacred and is eternal.
[00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:16.288]  So no, whatever happens, we will never give up.
[00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.709]  We will never surrender.
[00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:29.377]  We will never back down to the satanic, pedophile, globalist, New World Order, and their walking dead, reanimated corpse, Joe Biden.
[00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.401]  And we will never recognize him.
[00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.886]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:53.196]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.313 --> 00:05:02.635]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday edition.
[00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:03.916]  It is the 13th day of December 2020.
[00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:07.079]  We're 40 days out from the inauguration.
[00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:20.691]  Isn't it interesting that we have Joe Biden saying he's not going to be at the inauguration at the classic place that you do it in front of the Capitol, just a mile or so down the road from here, that he's going to do a virtual
[00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:22.169]  I think?
[00:05:50.165 --> 00:06:00.253]  But the bigger issue is the fact that Joe Biden is a globalist that said that Communist China should run every facet of our lives.
[00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:04.116]  And if we continue to... Come on over here!
[00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:04.957]  Get on air with us!
[00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:05.297]  Come on!
[00:06:06.478 --> 00:06:07.119]  Oh, you got one?
[00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:08.300]  Is that your IQ?
[00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:10.542]  That's your big IQ?
[00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:14.905]  Hey, we're not antifa like you that are anti-free speech!
[00:06:15.766 --> 00:06:16.907]  You're on air, smart man!
[00:06:17.487 --> 00:06:18.008]  Come on over here!
[00:06:19.082 --> 00:06:20.242]  Oh, wear your little panty mask?
[00:06:21.283 --> 00:06:21.643]  No, no, no.
[00:06:21.783 --> 00:06:22.823]  Oh, I'm coming after you.
[00:06:22.964 --> 00:06:24.264]  You're the one who ran your mouth.
[00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:27.225]  You're the one who wears a little panty diaper over your face.
[00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:31.167]  Yeah, you wear your little slave diaper over your face there, buddy.
[00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:32.987]  Huh?
[00:06:33.888 --> 00:06:34.508]  Come on over.
[00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:35.688]  Get interviewed by us, big man.
[00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:39.270]  Or is that all you got, your one-figure IQ, huh?
[00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:43.344]  Okay, so a lot of great fans out here.
[00:06:43.364 --> 00:06:43.424]  USA!
[00:06:43.764 --> 00:06:43.884]  USA!
[00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:44.165]  USA!
[00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:44.565]  USA!
[00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:45.066]  USA!
[00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:45.346]  USA!
[00:06:45.366 --> 00:06:45.787]  USA!
[00:06:51.331 --> 00:06:53.712]  So we're out here, unscripted folks, no teleprompter.
[00:06:53.972 --> 00:06:54.873]  Let's just go to this now.
[00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:58.374]  Let's go to my speech at the Jericho event that was amazing.
[00:06:58.815 --> 00:06:59.735]  Tens of thousands there.
[00:06:59.895 --> 00:07:00.936]  Owen Schroer also spoke.
[00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:02.837]  Let's go to some highlights of those speeches.
[00:07:02.857 --> 00:07:13.922]  Then we're going to come back and I'll get into the chi-coms and the globalists, the next leg of the fight, and what America's facing if Joe Biden gets in, or Trump's very limited path to overturning this fraud that really lies in our hands.
[00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:18.084]  So here are those two pieces of information, and we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:07:18.484 --> 00:07:25.048]  Folks, in the spirit of unity, I'd like to bring out my new friend, Alex Jones, is it?
[00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:28.810]  I think his name is Alex Jones.
[00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:39.777]  Yeah!
[00:07:40.817 --> 00:07:44.319]  Praise God, America is awakening!
[00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:46.441]  Humanity is awakening!
[00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:47.261]  And Jesus Christ is
[00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:58.988]  Not David Rockefeller, not Bill Gates, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, but Jesus Christ is King!
[00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:07.252]  And God gave us and rose up Donald Trump to stand against the enemy and draw out the enemy.
[00:08:07.652 --> 00:08:15.075]  So as dark as some of these days are, understand this is the beginning of the great revival before the Antichrist comes!
[00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:19.162]  World government!
[00:08:19.602 --> 00:08:21.103]  Implantable microchips!
[00:08:21.463 --> 00:08:22.164]  Satanism!
[00:08:22.264 --> 00:08:23.365]  It's out of the open!
[00:08:23.585 --> 00:08:25.466]  The Bible is fulfilled!
[00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:27.347]  Revelation is fulfilled!
[00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:29.508]  Jesus Christ is fulfilled!
[00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.990]  God Almighty is in charge!
[00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.152]  And we follow that mighty God!
[00:08:37.994 --> 00:08:39.935]  You look at the miserable globalists.
[00:08:40.656 --> 00:08:42.677]  You look at people like Bill Gates.
[00:08:43.037 --> 00:08:47.040]  And you look at people like Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of them.
[00:08:48.163 --> 00:08:56.987]  They are miserable slaves of Satan, and we pray for them and hope that the Holy Spirit can still touch their soul.
[00:09:00.388 --> 00:09:10.192]  But more importantly, we pray for President Donald John Trump in this incredibly serious moment.
[00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:21.006]  And we pray for all the women in America who the system's trying to lie to, to kill their babies, and we say, don't kill your babies!
[00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:27.231]  The enemy has been forced out in the open.
[00:09:27.892 --> 00:09:29.773]  World government is here.
[00:09:30.434 --> 00:09:38.320]  And the system is publicly stealing this election from the biggest landslide and the biggest political realignment since 1776!
[00:09:44.231 --> 00:09:56.620]  Our God is the God of the universe, our God is the God of strength and honor and will, and God is in control, and God is on our side!
[00:10:00.242 --> 00:10:09.569]  So we praise God, and we thank God, and we know that it's all in God's plan, and the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:17.152]  Christ's crucifixion was not our defeat, it was our greatest victory!
[00:10:19.634 --> 00:10:25.297]  When he rose again on the third day, he broke the chains of hell and death!
[00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:29.940]  We have the deed to this planet!
[00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:32.942]  We have the deed to eternal life!
[00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:37.125]  And we praise Jesus Christ and the Father!
[00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:52.781]  The enemy wants to keep the whorehouses open and the liquor stores open and the Walmarts open and the Targets and the Amazons while they tell you the churches are not essential!
[00:10:55.884 --> 00:11:02.490]  Congress shall make no law establishing the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.762]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or the free exercise thereof.
[00:11:11.162 --> 00:11:16.663]  Meaning, our forebears did not have separation of church and state as they spent it.
[00:11:17.083 --> 00:11:21.604]  It means the state has no jurisdiction over any of us.
[00:11:24.765 --> 00:11:28.286]  Our relationship with God is sacred and is eternal.
[00:11:29.557 --> 00:11:32.178]  So no, whatever happens, we will never give up.
[00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:33.639]  We will never surrender.
[00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:38.802]  We will never back down to the satanic, pedophile, globalist, New World Order.
[00:11:40.443 --> 00:11:45.325]  And their walking dead, reanimated corpse, Joe Biden.
[00:11:47.727 --> 00:11:50.388]  And we will never recognize him.
[00:11:52.869 --> 00:11:55.050]  President Trump had zero connection to Russians.
[00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:56.191]  No proof.
[00:11:56.511 --> 00:11:57.632]  Four years of investigation.
[00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:01.211]  With the Biden's it's open and shut.
[00:12:01.812 --> 00:12:06.536]  So I don't know who's going to the White House in 38 days, but I sure know this.
[00:12:07.136 --> 00:12:12.782]  Joe Biden is a globalist and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.
[00:12:19.267 --> 00:12:20.649]  Our great first president,
[00:12:21.693 --> 00:12:23.134]  We literally are here on his farm.
[00:12:23.174 --> 00:12:23.855]  That's where we're at.
[00:12:24.475 --> 00:12:27.177]  George Washington didn't want to be king.
[00:12:27.197 --> 00:12:31.120]  And after he served two terms and set that precedent, he left.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.343]  He was a very quiet man and didn't talk about his beliefs when he was a Christian.
[00:12:35.703 --> 00:12:39.926]  But those that knew him privately knew he knew God controlled battlefields.
[00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:41.607]  God controlled governments.
[00:12:41.967 --> 00:12:43.408]  God controls the games.
[00:12:43.869 --> 00:12:48.292]  And all his success was because of his love of God.
[00:12:50.271 --> 00:12:52.572]  And being in line with God.
[00:12:53.353 --> 00:12:58.875]  So never forget, we worship the true God that created the universe and all of us.
[00:12:59.655 --> 00:13:06.499]  And the satanic globalists trying to take control of us and trying to play God are fallen and are failed.
[00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:11.121]  And we need to just keep our eyes on Christ and never back down and never surrender.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.961]  At four o'clock today, we're going to march back to the Supreme Court.
[00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:19.542]  You got some other great folks at Freedom Plaza.
[00:13:19.762 --> 00:13:21.643]  If some of you aren't here later, go get them.
[00:13:21.963 --> 00:13:24.663]  Lead them to the Supreme Court at four at this great event.
[00:13:25.024 --> 00:13:26.084]  But pray for America.
[00:13:26.304 --> 00:13:27.024]  Pray for the world.
[00:13:27.324 --> 00:13:28.045]  Pray for Trump.
[00:13:28.245 --> 00:13:30.425]  And realize you're not going to get instant gratification.
[00:13:30.825 --> 00:13:32.346]  But with Trump, it's as close as it got.
[00:13:32.626 --> 00:13:34.387]  Look how far we've come.
[00:13:34.867 --> 00:13:36.587]  Look at what we've been able to do.
[00:13:36.847 --> 00:13:38.428]  And this is just the beginning.
[00:13:39.108 --> 00:13:44.592]  I'm going to turn this over to my buddy for two minutes, my great co-host at InfoWars.com, Owen Troyer.
[00:13:45.493 --> 00:13:49.896]  And then the next great guests are coming up here, but remember this.
[00:13:51.057 --> 00:13:57.701]  God ordained this republic to stand against the satanic empires, the Nazis and the communists and others.
[00:13:58.582 --> 00:14:01.944]  And so 1776 is God's number of victory over the satanic 1984.
[00:14:02.044 --> 00:14:03.365]  God bless you all.
[00:14:09.477 --> 00:14:10.317]  And I salute you!
[00:14:10.357 --> 00:14:11.257]  Thank you, Jesus!
[00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:22.000]  How do we feel about Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:33.722]  I'm a little happy for Chris to know here.
[00:14:46.547 --> 00:15:01.287]  That's the, uh... I can't.
[00:15:02.199 --> 00:15:05.160]  You just heard some of the speech I gave at the Jericho Group and what Owen did.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.641]  It was great being invited out there where those folks really enjoyed it.
[00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:10.022]  And this is this fight between good and evil.
[00:15:10.582 --> 00:15:19.145]  But during our shooting for this Sunday transmission, the live part of it's coming up with Harrison Smith here in about 15 minutes, a guy came over and started saying, F-U, F-U, F-U.
[00:15:19.665 --> 00:15:22.086]  So we said, hey, come on over here and talk to us.
[00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:23.787]  Come on air.
[00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:26.408]  Don't show us your one-point IQ when they flip us off.
[00:15:27.168 --> 00:15:28.668]  And he said, oh, you're intimidating me.
[00:15:28.688 --> 00:15:29.429]  You're threatening me.
[00:15:29.469 --> 00:15:29.989]  You're a bully.
[00:15:30.956 --> 00:15:33.937]  So it's Antifa that beats people up, shuts down people's speech.
[00:15:34.438 --> 00:15:37.599]  It's Antifa and the Democrats and big tech that are censoring everybody.
[00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:41.300]  They're the ones taking people's bank accounts that are nationalist or patriots or pro-Trump.
[00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:42.921]  They're the ones brainwashing our children.
[00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:44.742]  They're the ones funding authoritarian regimes.
[00:15:45.222 --> 00:15:46.943]  They're the ones that are engaged in all this, but then...
[00:15:48.251 --> 00:15:53.116]  When they see us out here and say, F you, we say, come on over, be on camera, tell us how we're bad.
[00:15:53.136 --> 00:15:54.798]  Oh, no, you're threatening me.
[00:15:55.198 --> 00:15:56.840]  Oh, you want to attack me.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.001]  It's crazy.
[00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:03.066]  Here we are at one of the very historic and also very haunting memorials.
[00:16:03.086 --> 00:16:06.289]  This is the Korean War or Korean Conflict Memorial.
[00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:24.373]  Where a lot of people died and again that was fighting the communist Chinese who were oppressing and taking control of the North Koreans And we see that fight ongoing today, and we see President Trump trying to get a successful peace deal with North Korea We see President Trump getting all of these huge peace deals
[00:16:25.413 --> 00:16:25.773]  I think?
[00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:55.222]  Then they turn around and say that we're anti-free speech by even talking back to them.
[00:16:55.583 --> 00:17:03.248]  That's how the left operates because they're communist and you've got big major corporations that are allied with the communists because they don't want free market.
[00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:06.191]  They don't want to have to deal with free people that have due process.
[00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:09.133]  They want to consolidate control and power.
[00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:13.476]  So that's why we're out here today again just to get a little bit of a tour around D.C.
[00:17:13.496 --> 00:17:18.100]  And I want to make one other point before we come back to the next segment and break down the latest news and huge developments.
[00:17:19.235 --> 00:17:21.277]  I love all the groups that were here in DC for Trump.
[00:17:21.757 --> 00:17:23.498]  And I don't normally come out to a lot of events.
[00:17:23.558 --> 00:17:24.959]  I don't normally come out and give big speeches.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.821]  We do stuff digitally at InfoWars.
[00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:27.922]  We reach millions of people a day.
[00:17:28.642 --> 00:17:33.146]  And there have been a lot of different groups out here running demonstrations and having events.
[00:17:33.326 --> 00:17:39.771]  And anytime I show up at one of those events, it becomes a big disturbance because so many people come over and start trying to talk to us.
[00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:43.334]  And I was going to the Supreme Court building
[00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:46.442]  Yes, because I heard there was going to be a rally that I was invited to.
[00:17:46.462 --> 00:17:47.622]  Didn't even know who was really doing it.
[00:17:47.662 --> 00:17:52.843]  I told a big crowd of people, hey, when this is over at the Jericho March, let's go over at 4 o'clock to the Supreme Court.
[00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:54.484]  About an hour later, we get there.
[00:17:55.244 --> 00:17:55.864]  I'm walking up.
[00:17:55.884 --> 00:17:56.504]  There's a hill.
[00:17:56.624 --> 00:17:57.205]  People are standing there.
[00:17:57.225 --> 00:17:58.105]  I came to see what's happening.
[00:17:58.485 --> 00:18:03.426]  And a bunch of security guys kind of run into us and say, hey, you're not going to, quote, take over our stage.
[00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:05.147]  And so I said, that's fine.
[00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:06.067]  We're going to play that video in a moment.
[00:18:06.107 --> 00:18:06.827]  I said, hey, that's fine.
[00:18:06.847 --> 00:18:07.547]  Get your hands off me.
[00:18:07.968 --> 00:18:08.728]  We'll go over here.
[00:18:09.208 --> 00:18:12.909]  But then as soon as we walked away, everybody followed us away and went over there to hear me speak.
[00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:13.609]  I think?
[00:18:39.002 --> 00:18:39.523]  We're good to go.
[00:18:52.011 --> 00:18:52.231]  I don't
[00:19:18.337 --> 00:19:18.898]  We're good to go.
[00:19:34.451 --> 00:19:35.512]  That's what Infowars is about.
[00:19:35.552 --> 00:19:38.954]  It's a platform to promote all these great guests, all these great people we have on.
[00:19:39.254 --> 00:19:40.915]  And I just love all the Trump folks.
[00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:42.516]  And some of us are libertarians.
[00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.056]  Some of us are more populist.
[00:19:44.397 --> 00:19:45.937]  Some of us are more super right-wing.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.840]  Other people are kind of mainline liberals, but they're anti-war, so they like Trump.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.821]  Some of us are for decriminalization of drugs.
[00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:52.321]  It doesn't matter.
[00:19:52.581 --> 00:19:53.462]  We're all Americans.
[00:19:53.663 --> 00:19:56.767]  For every race, color, and creed, we care about freedom, and that's what it all comes down to.
[00:19:57.047 --> 00:19:58.750]  So here's the video of what happened.
[00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.134]  I'm trying to find our own video, which we don't have, of what happened right at the first.
[00:20:02.154 --> 00:20:03.856]  As you can see, they charge into us.
[00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:04.557]  We stop.
[00:20:04.597 --> 00:20:05.138]  We turn around.
[00:20:05.198 --> 00:20:05.579]  We leave.
[00:20:05.899 --> 00:20:06.820]  We're friends with those folks.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.224]  Not sure who they are exactly, but everything's great.
[00:20:09.404 --> 00:20:09.925]  Here's that footage.
[00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:15.266]  Maybe I just got a little enthusiastic, but we're gonna do it!
[00:20:15.286 --> 00:20:16.986]  So go to TrumpMarch.com!
[00:20:17.086 --> 00:20:19.967]  You're not allowed to be here!
[00:20:20.027 --> 00:20:22.608]  You're not allowed to be here!
[00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.270]  Alex!
[00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.631]  Alex!
[00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:36.031]  Alex!
[00:21:00.327 --> 00:21:02.228]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:21:25.652 --> 00:21:29.214]  Okay, so there's what actually happened at that event, not what some folks have been spinning.
[00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.015]  Let's move on to the really important news.
[00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:39.179]  Hunter Biden subpoenaed, over Burisma, two dozen other entities as part of four criminal investigations.
[00:21:39.679 --> 00:21:40.380]  Communist China,
[00:21:41.328 --> 00:21:49.394]  The Ukrainians, the Russians, it's all being investigated, but it's being investigated by the same Justice Department that never does anything.
[00:21:50.094 --> 00:21:56.639]  And then if Joe Biden is able to insert himself into power, we've got a really, really serious problem.
[00:21:56.939 --> 00:22:04.665]  Because then they'll get even more of their people into the Justice Department and more of their swamp creatures into the depths of these lairs to be able to basically be above the law.
[00:22:05.509 --> 00:22:11.772]  If you think the Clintons and the Bushes and Obama were corrupt, Joe Biden doesn't even know what planet he's on.
[00:22:12.172 --> 00:22:20.456]  And so the lobbyists of special interest that are going to overrun Washington is a real national security crisis and a threat to the entire world.
[00:22:20.516 --> 00:22:23.038]  Now, let's get back to fake news.
[00:22:23.098 --> 00:22:27.660]  Hate to make ourselves the center of the news, but it's a great case point of the propaganda and disinfo.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.903]  I gave that Jericho speech that you just saw last segment, where I said, Joe Biden's a reanimated corpse.
[00:22:35.211 --> 00:22:41.993]  And he's not going to be our president one way or the other, whether he doesn't get in now or whether we remove him with impeachment for being a globalist CHICOM agent.
[00:22:42.433 --> 00:22:47.355]  The media spun that, that I was saying that I want to kill Joe Biden.
[00:22:47.415 --> 00:22:50.015]  The last thing I want is to kill Joe Biden.
[00:22:50.415 --> 00:22:51.536]  That would turn him into a martyr.
[00:22:52.316 --> 00:22:54.077]  Turn a horrible monster into a martyr.
[00:22:54.277 --> 00:22:56.297]  We want to kill the ideas he's pushing.
[00:22:56.557 --> 00:23:01.379]  We want to kill his agenda of bankrupting America and turning off our plants and cutting off our oil.
[00:23:01.739 --> 00:23:04.720]  We want to kill the New World Order idea of tyranny.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:16.043]  We don't want to hurt the puppet of it all and then... So we've seen all these surrogates of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and their minion, their front man, the senile
[00:23:17.699 --> 00:23:24.901]  Empty suit Joe Biden saying that they wanted to kill Trump, that they want to destroy America, that they don't want our borders to even exist.
[00:23:24.921 --> 00:23:25.681]  They hate our military.
[00:23:25.701 --> 00:23:26.281]  They hate the police.
[00:23:26.301 --> 00:23:29.662]  They hate everything because they want full control over society.
[00:23:30.222 --> 00:23:32.783]  Look at the latest article on Infowars.com.
[00:23:33.343 --> 00:23:34.283]  Unity and healing.
[00:23:34.503 --> 00:23:37.984]  Joe Biden posts pictures of dogs tearing up Trump doll.
[00:23:38.885 --> 00:23:40.365]  And sure, you can say that's funny.
[00:23:40.485 --> 00:23:41.205]  It actually is.
[00:23:42.786 --> 00:23:43.826]  But imagine if
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.927]  Trump posted images of Hillary being torn up by dogs.
[00:23:51.007 --> 00:23:52.589]  It would be the end of the world.
[00:23:53.209 --> 00:23:59.817]  And that's the thing about these people, is that the rules they want you to play by, they don't play by.
[00:24:00.778 --> 00:24:04.743]  And they consistently get away with whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:24:05.831 --> 00:24:19.920]  And when I try to explain to viewers and listeners how much danger all of us are in society by letting Joe Biden get into office through fraud, it's really unlimited how dangerous it is.
[00:24:21.662 --> 00:24:25.044]  The globalists I've coined a term are dystopics.
[00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:36.816]  They believe in creating a dystopic future as a system of management and control because it's hard to build a good society and you're going to make mistakes.
[00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:45.702]  But if you artificially try to enslave and oppress people, authoritarianism, and try to actually build a dystopia on purpose, then you're a dystopic.
[00:24:47.423 --> 00:24:48.885]  And that's what this group is.
[00:24:49.895 --> 00:24:55.959]  And that's why you can never project onto them enough evil because that's who they are.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.982]  You can never imagine any depths to them.
[00:25:00.162 --> 00:25:05.706]  That's what the Bible calls hell, a bottomless pit, because there's no bottom to who these individuals are.
[00:25:06.347 --> 00:25:13.112]  We project our goodness, our decency, wanting to work with people, wanting to treat others like we want to be treated, onto them, and that's not how it works.
[00:25:13.692 --> 00:25:14.273]  Here's an example.
[00:25:15.205 --> 00:25:15.966]  I've been here in D.C.
[00:25:15.986 --> 00:25:24.312]  for three days, and I have talked to hundreds of people that have told me in restaurants and in hotels, hey, put your mask on.
[00:25:24.652 --> 00:25:36.961]  And I say, hey, listen, I know you're told to do that, but did you know that the new vaccine, MRNA vaccine, has HIV in it, and that's why it's giving positive HIV tests?
[00:25:37.782 --> 00:25:39.203]  And they look at me and say, that's crazy.
[00:25:39.483 --> 00:25:42.265]  And I pull my phone out and I show them the Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:25:43.186 --> 00:25:50.411]  And I explained that it has HIV in it, and the HIV delivery system, and I've gotten a few people brought to tears.
[00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:51.312]  Because you know what?
[00:25:51.352 --> 00:25:52.433]  They should be brought to tears.
[00:25:53.013 --> 00:25:53.874]  You see those children?
[00:25:54.855 --> 00:25:57.437]  A lot of these parents are virtue signalers.
[00:25:58.297 --> 00:26:06.023]  And even though they're recommending in the UK children not have the COVID shot, the left, as a sacrament of their subservience to the system,
[00:26:07.423 --> 00:26:12.326]  Are making two-year-old children wear masks and are saying we're going to inject our kids with more vaccines.
[00:26:12.787 --> 00:26:30.019]  And when they have convulsions or they become brain damaged, they love it because it is a symbol like human sacrifice where people will sacrifice their kids throughout history to the system and a symbol of how cuck they are and how they want to live completely and totally under the Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:26:30.679 --> 00:26:35.583]  And here's an example how the globalists are these dystopians that want to create a dystopic system.
[00:26:36.323 --> 00:26:37.484]  So again, they are the dystopians.
[00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:52.497]  They know full well that almost everyone that gets sick from COVID, which is a real virus but very, very weak, have a vitamin and mineral deficiency of zinc, vitamin D3, and C. If you have those, any virus will kill you.
[00:26:53.037 --> 00:27:01.684]  There's another major study out that 80% of people that have been hospitalized from COVID that are actually sick have a vitamin D deficiency in their blood tests.
[00:27:02.265 --> 00:27:02.465]  Again,
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.960]  But that's buried news.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:14.283]  And when all these medical doctors and all these scientists came out in the last 10 months and said, get your vitamin D3, get your zinc, get your C, the media said, that's BS.
[00:27:14.503 --> 00:27:15.764]  There's no treatment for COVID.
[00:27:16.904 --> 00:27:21.686]  Well, that's like saying there's no treatment for dying of thirst and malnutrition.
[00:27:22.626 --> 00:27:23.266]  Yes, there is.
[00:27:23.406 --> 00:27:25.687]  Drink water and you won't die of thirst.
[00:27:26.767 --> 00:27:28.748]  You won't die of dehydration.
[00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:29.930]  It's
[00:27:45.422 --> 00:27:57.593]  Medical doctors' facilities in Michigan and other areas because people had COVID and they wanted to come in and get an alternative treatment that was a cocktail of vitamin D3, vitamin C, zinc, and other things directly in their blood.
[00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:00.575]  Those places are all over the country and all over the world because they work.
[00:28:01.296 --> 00:28:03.658]  I'm not a big medical guy, but I go in and get IVs sometimes.
[00:28:03.678 --> 00:28:09.163]  They make me feel wonderful with the same stuff, and I'm not doing it for COVID, but we have free will in this country.
[00:28:09.803 --> 00:28:12.586]  But why would the dystopics tell you
[00:28:13.962 --> 00:28:21.706]  Nothing can save you, nothing can help you, and then lie to you about, if you're malnourished, any regular virus will kill you.
[00:28:22.547 --> 00:28:29.791]  Because they want to make the world a hellish place, and then only they have the solutions that give them more power and more control.
[00:28:31.178 --> 00:28:32.359]  I'll be on the radio tomorrow.
[00:28:32.379 --> 00:28:34.361]  Harrison Smith's going to take over here in a few minutes.
[00:28:34.401 --> 00:28:38.224]  But the big news I just wanted to announce is they're trying to suppress the Great Awakening.
[00:28:38.624 --> 00:28:39.905]  Trump wanted a landslide.
[00:28:40.186 --> 00:28:46.371]  So as depressing as all this criminal theft is, they're being forced to do it in the power structure because they've been repudiated.
[00:28:46.751 --> 00:28:47.652]  They've been rejected.
[00:28:48.172 --> 00:28:52.056]  And the whole world is turning against their globalist system right now.
[00:28:52.516 --> 00:28:54.097]  So don't get jejected.
[00:28:54.618 --> 00:28:55.278]  Realize that
[00:28:55.999 --> 00:28:58.961]  The fight against the New World Order has just begun.
[00:28:59.722 --> 00:29:10.149]  And everything the system does is to make you a victim and to make you give in to the system instead of you getting the knowledge and the information to overcome it and become aware of how you can defeat this system.
[00:29:11.038 --> 00:29:11.538]  I want to be clear.
[00:29:11.558 --> 00:29:14.460]  It doesn't mean just because I have all this advice, I always follow around perfect.
[00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:17.202]  All of this is part of a process of life.
[00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:21.925]  But the first thing you've got to realize is the globalists are bad news.
[00:29:22.445 --> 00:29:23.326]  They're out to get you.
[00:29:24.046 --> 00:29:25.527]  Communist China is their model.
[00:29:26.187 --> 00:29:29.009]  And if you submit to them, things are only going to get worse.
[00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.291]  Now, there's so many other points I can go over.
[00:29:32.151 --> 00:29:39.076]  And we've got a whole other hour plus coming up with Harrison Smith, and then we've got Sunday Live continuing into Overdrive, 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:29:39.116 --> 00:29:39.476]  Central.
[00:29:39.837 --> 00:29:43.920]  But Owen Schroer blew his voice out giving all these big speeches, but I'm making him get over here.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.462]  He's been whispering in my ear during the breaks, telling me some key points I haven't been making.
[00:29:49.369 --> 00:29:50.690]  Yeah, I probably sound like hell.
[00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.451]  Someday I'll probably eventually sound like Alex over there.
[00:29:53.511 --> 00:30:00.955]  But, you know, losing my voice for a week or a couple days or, you know, extending a little voice trauma for even the rest of my life is barely a sacrifice.
[00:30:01.475 --> 00:30:08.898]  You know, I was just over at the Korean War Memorial and my grandfather fought in the Korean War.
[00:30:09.159 --> 00:30:09.539]  And so,
[00:30:10.219 --> 00:30:15.381]  You know, many great men, better than us, better than we can even imagine, put everything on the line for this country.
[00:30:15.441 --> 00:30:22.523]  So, for me to be yelling for a week straight, having all these rallies and, you know, dealing with the voice issues, you know, it's a small price to pay.
[00:30:22.763 --> 00:30:24.704]  It's a small price to pay for freedom.
[00:30:24.884 --> 00:30:27.785]  It's a small price to pay to live in America, which is all I want.
[00:30:28.365 --> 00:30:35.328]  I just want to live in a free country, and I hope I'd be blessed if my voice is the only thing I have to sacrifice.
[00:30:35.949 --> 00:30:39.730]  Because many men before me had to sacrifice much, much more.
[00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:46.134]  In fact, many made the ultimate sacrifice, and we know what that is, and we honor that with all the great war memorials that we see out here.
[00:30:46.194 --> 00:30:49.995]  So more people, though, are stepping up and putting their lives on the line.
[00:30:50.015 --> 00:30:54.277]  More people are realizing that if they don't step up and fight now, they're going to have nothing left to fight for.
[00:30:55.638 --> 00:30:56.899]  The next great fight for America.
[00:30:56.939 --> 00:30:59.561]  This is the next great historical battle for the future of America.
[00:30:59.881 --> 00:31:01.582]  Call it the Great American Renaissance.
[00:31:01.602 --> 00:31:03.363]  Call it the Great American Awakening.
[00:31:03.383 --> 00:31:04.584]  The World Awakening.
[00:31:04.864 --> 00:31:05.664]  1776 worldwide.
[00:31:05.744 --> 00:31:06.405]  American Revolution 2.0.
[00:31:06.945 --> 00:31:07.806]  But we're in it.
[00:31:08.026 --> 00:31:09.147]  It's an honor to be in it with you.
[00:31:09.627 --> 00:31:10.668]  And you know Infowars.
[00:31:10.688 --> 00:31:12.169]  It's going to put it all on the line.
[00:31:12.689 --> 00:31:13.830]  Victory or death.
[00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:15.551]  Liberty or death.
[00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:16.872]  Thank you Owen.
[00:31:16.892 --> 00:31:17.372]  Great points.
[00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:18.553]  I'm going to say this in closing.
[00:31:18.573 --> 00:31:20.194]  I'm going to hand them off to Don to Harrison Smith.
[00:31:20.934 --> 00:31:21.855]  We're not giving in.
[00:31:22.035 --> 00:31:23.016]  We're not backing down.
[00:31:23.396 --> 00:31:26.018]  Because giving in and backing down only makes things worse in the future.
[00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:28.259]  Joe Biden's illegitimate.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.440]  The UN's illegitimate.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.782]  Xi Jinping and the Communist Chinese are illegitimate.
[00:31:32.122 --> 00:31:40.909]  This whole satanic leftist system and the universities and the big banks are all criminal, parasitic frauds, domesticating you and dumbing you down to control you.
[00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:42.550]  That's why we've got to be opposed.
[00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:44.090]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:49.752]  I want to tell you, we can't finance this and fight this hard without your support, so do your Christmas shopping at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:32:01.516 --> 00:32:03.017]  We're going to go to break.
[00:32:03.077 --> 00:32:03.977]  Harris is just coming up.
[00:32:04.237 --> 00:32:09.139]  He's got more highlights of the big marches and events, and a lot of the gigantic breaking news.
[00:32:09.399 --> 00:32:09.919]  Stay with us.
[00:32:10.099 --> 00:32:11.420]  The revolution is televised.
[00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:17.253]  And I want to salute you all!
[00:32:17.273 --> 00:32:23.957]  I want to salute you all for your indefensibility against brutality!
[00:32:23.977 --> 00:32:25.378]  I salute you!
[00:32:25.458 --> 00:32:28.920]  President Trump won by a landslide.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:37.986]  The pedophile Joe Biden is a globalist operative in America, and the world is not accepting
[00:32:40.839 --> 00:32:48.187]  There's a big discussion as Americans, as patriots, as populists, as Christians, as parents, and just as humans we have to have.
[00:32:49.108 --> 00:32:57.397]  What do we do politically to make sure that the Trumpian revolution that we created, we pushed, the populism continues?
[00:32:58.458 --> 00:32:59.599]  Is the Republican Party
[00:33:00.543 --> 00:33:02.945]  Betraying President Trump by not backing him further.
[00:33:02.986 --> 00:33:03.967]  Has the Supreme Court done it?
[00:33:04.427 --> 00:33:05.008]  Absolutely.
[00:33:05.448 --> 00:33:18.762]  We're about to show you a viral clip of Nick Fuentes yesterday speaking to over 100,000 people and the video has over 5 million views, just one version, because it resonates with people that we need to destroy the GOP.
[00:33:19.102 --> 00:33:20.944]  Now I'm not disagreeing with Nick Fuentes.
[00:33:21.064 --> 00:33:21.865]  I get his position.
[00:33:22.469 --> 00:33:28.453]  I understand we need to destroy the establishment GOP, but what about take over the GOP?
[00:33:28.933 --> 00:33:31.454]  What about continue what we did with Trump?
[00:33:31.895 --> 00:33:34.056]  We forced their counter-establishment revolution.
[00:33:34.576 --> 00:33:35.797]  Now we fully take it over.
[00:33:35.977 --> 00:33:40.300]  I think we should take over the GOP, not destroy the GOP.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.601]  I think we should take over the Democratic Party if we could.
[00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:43.141]  That'd be easier.
[00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:43.862]  We probably can't.
[00:33:44.402 --> 00:33:45.323]  It's destroying America.
[00:33:45.383 --> 00:33:45.863]  It's global.
[00:33:45.883 --> 00:33:47.084]  It's just trying to get rid of the nation.
[00:33:47.384 --> 00:33:50.906]  But here's the clip of Nick Fuentes, then we'll get Owen Schroer's take on this.
[00:33:53.629 --> 00:34:02.877]  In the first Million MAGA March, we promised that if the GOP would not do everything in their power to keep Trump in office, then we would destroy the GOP.
[00:34:02.897 --> 00:34:14.147]  And as we gather here in Washington DC for a second Million MAGA March, we're done making promises.
[00:34:14.607 --> 00:34:15.968]  It has to happen now.
[00:34:16.229 --> 00:34:17.910]  We are going to destroy the GOP.
[00:34:24.307 --> 00:34:25.147]  Let's go!
[00:34:25.187 --> 00:34:26.328]  Let's go!
[00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:27.948]  Destroy the GOP!
[00:34:27.988 --> 00:34:29.629]  Destroy the GOP!
[00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:31.290]  Destroy the GOP!
[00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.951]  Destroy the GOP!
[00:34:32.991 --> 00:34:34.452]  Destroy the GOP!
[00:34:34.592 --> 00:34:36.272]  Destroy the GOP!
[00:34:36.312 --> 00:34:37.953]  Destroy the GOP!
[00:34:37.993 --> 00:34:39.714]  Destroy the GOP!
[00:34:39.734 --> 00:34:41.355]  Destroy the GOP!
[00:34:41.415 --> 00:34:48.418]  The GOP wants us to hold the line and vote for rhinos like David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in New Jersey.
[00:34:54.249 --> 00:34:55.850]  Nick Fuentes is a smart guy.
[00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:56.831]  I like Nick Fuentes.
[00:34:56.871 --> 00:34:57.992]  I think his heart's in the right place.
[00:34:58.352 --> 00:34:59.694]  And I'm not saying he's wrong.
[00:35:00.374 --> 00:35:08.181]  I think we should destroy the RINO establishment, GOP, and get more Trumpists, more Nationalists, more Infowarriors elected.
[00:35:08.341 --> 00:35:09.362]  I think that's the answer.
[00:35:09.722 --> 00:35:13.065]  I've seen Twitter and others not blocking videos like this because they kind of want to drive a wedge.
[00:35:13.565 --> 00:35:15.647]  But just because they think it drives a wedge, I don't think it does.
[00:35:15.747 --> 00:35:17.649]  I think we say we take over the GOP.
[00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:24.646]  You know, I think that people just tend to forget that the Republican Party didn't want Trump four years ago.
[00:35:24.786 --> 00:35:30.048]  And so it's kind of this, you know, after they pretended to like Trump or made some deals with Trump, you know.
[00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:34.936]  Now we're in this place where we realize, oh wait, they never had our back to begin with.
[00:35:35.257 --> 00:35:37.237]  Trump's nominees in the Supreme Court stabbed us.
[00:35:37.257 --> 00:35:39.958]  The Republican Party is letting the Democrats steal the election.
[00:35:39.998 --> 00:35:47.120]  So I think it's a matter of that reminder that the Republican Party tried to reject Trump in 2015 and 2016, and we just overcame that.
[00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:51.922]  And then they kind of played along and got along with us, but now they're back to normal establishment politics.
[00:35:52.202 --> 00:35:54.183]  That's right, you just said it way better than I can.
[00:35:54.404 --> 00:35:55.324]  Sure, that's why I love Owen.
[00:35:55.664 --> 00:35:56.225]  Absolutely.
[00:35:57.045 --> 00:35:58.667]  Are we feeling like we're crestfallen?
[00:35:58.687 --> 00:36:02.589]  Are we being road hard put away wet that the Republican establishment doesn't like Trump?
[00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:08.754]  When we won and forced his agenda through, they bid their time and claimed they were for Trump because of the support.
[00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:24.141]  So I think we destroy the neocons and the globalist Republican Party, but we make our main focus on the Democrats and on the Senate seats in Georgia and on taking control of the House and Senate and removing rhinos and removing neocons and putting populist patriots in.
[00:36:24.341 --> 00:36:26.482]  And that goes for Democrats too, like Tulsi Gabbard or others.
[00:36:26.883 --> 00:36:31.145]  If people want to be more populist and liberal, they should be supported in districts that are going to go Democrat anyways.
[00:36:31.425 --> 00:36:35.627]  We should have a takeover of populism in the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.
[00:36:35.707 --> 00:36:35.787]  Owen?
[00:36:36.207 --> 00:36:38.911]  Yeah, there have been a couple Democrats that even switched Republican.
[00:36:38.951 --> 00:36:41.135]  Vernon Jones is obviously one of the big ones.
[00:36:41.155 --> 00:36:42.477]  There's another one on the East Coast.
[00:36:42.517 --> 00:36:43.578]  I forget the gentleman's name.
[00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:51.651]  So, I think that populism and just really just logic and common sense is what needs to rue the day for whatever party wants to be successful into the future.
[00:36:52.196 --> 00:36:52.536]  That's right.
[00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:55.218]  I'm going to ask Nick Fuentes right now, as soon as we stop here.
[00:36:55.238 --> 00:36:58.680]  I'm going to call him and say, please come on the Monday show, because I wanted to run into him while I was here.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.861]  I miss Roger Stone and him.
[00:37:00.521 --> 00:37:01.482]  But hey, we're not a cult.
[00:37:01.522 --> 00:37:03.003]  We don't all agree with the exact same thing.
[00:37:03.023 --> 00:37:04.163]  We're all going in the same direction.
[00:37:04.464 --> 00:37:06.465]  Freedom, liberty, you know, a pro-human future.
[00:37:06.525 --> 00:37:11.428]  But those that are attacking Fuentes for saying this, hey, the Republican Party establishments the enemy.
[00:37:11.888 --> 00:37:13.809]  And people that want to destroy them are the good guys.
[00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.111]  You can differ on what does that destruction mean?
[00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:17.732]  I mean to take it over.
[00:37:18.092 --> 00:37:18.793]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:37:18.833 --> 00:37:21.015]  This is InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:37:21.195 --> 00:37:22.916]  And now Harrison Smith takes over.
[00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:23.377]  Stay with us.
[00:37:25.083 --> 00:37:49.499]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen this is Harrison Smith taking over for Alex Jones who is right now in Washington DC with a who's who a full cast of right-wing dissidents of true American patriots there celebrating the Trump victory which is really what it was and there are still several paths towards victory that Trump is going to take one of these being sort of the final parachute pull of
[00:37:50.179 --> 00:37:50.259]  It's
[00:38:15.425 --> 00:38:19.627]  COVID-19 deal more outrageous activity by the Democrats of course.
[00:38:19.907 --> 00:38:26.111]  Last night and all of yesterday in Washington DC was in many places a total bloodbath.
[00:38:26.211 --> 00:38:35.235]  Four stabbed during battles between Black Lives Matter activists and what has the Daily Mail puts it the defeated president's supporters in Washington DC.
[00:38:35.695 --> 00:38:39.738]  The as of yet still president of the United States Donald Trump supporters.
[00:38:40.338 --> 00:38:41.839]  Proud boys out there protecting
[00:38:42.765 --> 00:39:10.060]  People who were there showing their support for the president, because I don't know if you remember this, I know so much happens that it's sometimes impossible to cast your mind back into the far distant past of just a few weeks ago, when the Million MAGA March, as it was wrapping up, as the sun was going down, suddenly out from the shadows, from the alleys and the underways of Washington DC, crawled Antifa and Black Lives Matter, these mask-clad, black-wearing
[00:39:11.243 --> 00:39:16.727]  Terrorists coming out to attack and bash and yell at and stab.
[00:39:16.767 --> 00:39:25.434]  I mean, just all-out anarchy to absolutely destroy the peaceful protesters that were there protesting to stop the steal for the Million Maga March.
[00:39:26.054 --> 00:39:27.355]  That didn't happen last night.
[00:39:27.395 --> 00:39:40.645]  Last night, those terrorists, those evil scumbags who were around attacking families and elderly people and young couples, who were all there, just absolutely
[00:39:42.352 --> 00:39:46.494]  Terrorizing everybody involved in the Million MAGA March several weeks ago.
[00:39:47.055 --> 00:39:49.016]  Well now they had a defense force.
[00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:50.216]  Now they had backup.
[00:39:50.296 --> 00:39:55.819]  Now the Proud Boys were there to make sure that those innocent protesters were not targeted by Black Lives Matter.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.722]  I think all four of these people who have been stabbed are still in critical condition.
[00:40:00.762 --> 00:40:01.542]  Cops made at least 23 arrests.
[00:40:03.814 --> 00:40:06.615]  During the event, it was a massive, massive showing.
[00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:09.956]  You had Michael Flynn, Alex Jones, Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys.
[00:40:09.996 --> 00:40:16.057]  I mean everybody who's anybody on this side, not even just this side of the aisle, this side of this side of the aisle.
[00:40:16.077 --> 00:40:22.999]  If you've got the aisle down the middle, that's the left and the right of the Democrats and the Republicans, there's still a distinct divide between the
[00:40:24.773 --> 00:40:43.700]  Blue blood establishment Republicans, the respectable Republicans who will very respectably go down with the ship, who will very respectably allow the Democrats to cheat them out of a country, versus the pro-America, America first, dissident right.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:48.522]  And that's the Alex Joneses, that's the Nick Fuenteses, the Roger Stones, the Donald J. Trumps.
[00:40:49.611 --> 00:40:50.131]  of the party.
[00:40:50.372 --> 00:40:51.452]  And so it was a massive showing.
[00:40:51.752 --> 00:40:56.015]  And so even in just that, we can take a massive victory lap.
[00:40:56.836 --> 00:41:02.480]  I saw somebody on Twitter yesterday say, I never thought I would see Alex Jones go mainstream.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:10.245]  And it was under that video that you saw earlier in the program of Alex Jones speaking to an absolutely massive crowd, getting cheers at his every word.
[00:41:10.725 --> 00:41:14.708]  His very name elicits a massive eruption of support
[00:41:15.228 --> 00:41:17.209]  From whichever crowd he's getting in front of.
[00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:21.192]  This is something unprecedented and it's for one simple reason.
[00:41:21.332 --> 00:41:22.954]  It's because Alex Jones tells the truth.
[00:41:23.294 --> 00:41:34.302]  Because we here at InfoWars have done everything we can to reveal the lies and destroy the plans of the globalists to put us under a worldwide system of total control.
[00:41:34.862 --> 00:41:35.943]  And people who are aware
[00:41:36.971 --> 00:41:37.391]  We're good to go.
[00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:57.273]  I had a write-up recently in the Austin Chronicle.
[00:41:57.313 --> 00:42:01.035]  They're quoting the ADL and they're calling me a racist, an anti-Semite.
[00:42:01.315 --> 00:42:05.877]  They say my toxic rage targets blacks and the LGBT.
[00:42:06.337 --> 00:42:07.178]  None of this is true.
[00:42:07.438 --> 00:42:10.439]  And my family sees this and they go, what the hell is going on here?
[00:42:10.819 --> 00:42:12.460]  Why are they calling you all of these things?
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.101]  This is horrible.
[00:42:13.361 --> 00:42:15.762]  It's like I have to remind them I'm an enemy of the state.
[00:42:16.842 --> 00:42:19.303]  Not the American state, not the United States.
[00:42:19.664 --> 00:42:21.104]  I'm not an enemy of patriots.
[00:42:21.504 --> 00:42:22.225]  I'm not an enemy of
[00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:48.139]  Those that want to do good and want to uphold our constitutional republic, but I am an enemy of the subversive state, of the global state, of the World Organization, the World Health Organization, and the UN, and the ADL, and the SPLC, and all of these non-governmental organizations that are telling our government what to do, telling our government who to censor, and controlling our big tech and everybody else that's circumventing our freedoms.
[00:42:49.059 --> 00:42:50.841]  So, it's an interesting position to be in.
[00:42:50.881 --> 00:42:57.527]  Here I am, not a racist, not an anti-Semite, love women, love men, love everybody, and yet I'm an enemy of the state.
[00:42:57.567 --> 00:43:00.389]  And that's just what you have to deal with, I guess, as a patriotic American.
[00:43:00.429 --> 00:43:02.271]  The good news is, that's turning around.
[00:43:02.311 --> 00:43:06.655]  The good news is, we are rapidly approaching that critical mass.
[00:43:07.056 --> 00:43:08.577]  That means victory is assured.
[00:43:08.617 --> 00:43:09.278]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:43:09.298 --> 00:43:10.659]  Second Hour begins in one minute.
[00:43:12.762 --> 00:43:26.696]  Patriots marched and spoke at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington, D.C., knowing that the glue that held America together had disintegrated after the betrayal of the Supreme Court decision, which blatantly ignored our constitutional republic.
[00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:00.848]  USA!
[00:44:01.328 --> 00:44:02.368]  USA!
[00:44:02.788 --> 00:44:11.593]  Americans from all walks of life, many who fought in foreign wars for this country, protested against all of the propaganda skewing their message.
[00:44:11.913 --> 00:44:22.998]  So it's amazing to be here in DC today, standing up for the President of the United States, saying we will not bow to the propaganda that the mainstream media keeps pushing down our throat.
[00:44:23.078 --> 00:44:24.379]  We will not bow.
[00:44:24.399 --> 00:44:27.160]  We want the truth.
[00:44:28.522 --> 00:44:29.989]  And stop the steal!
[00:44:30.009 --> 00:44:33.262]  They are trying to steal!
[00:44:35.421 --> 00:44:39.524]  They are trying to steal this country, not just from the president, but from us.
[00:44:39.965 --> 00:44:51.934]  The smug left came out in droves on Twitter, some calling for the arrest of Alex Jones for saying something countless Mockingbird Media pundits and celebrities had been saying for the past four years.
[00:44:52.114 --> 00:44:55.417]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:44:55.797 --> 00:44:57.378]  I want to clarify, I'm not an actor.
[00:44:59.184 --> 00:45:00.525]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[00:45:00.805 --> 00:45:03.346]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:45:03.886 --> 00:45:12.089]  As expected, the goons of radical socialism brought their brainwashed, useful, idiot monotony to the patriots who had taken the gloves off.
[00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:20.452]  Local police tried repeatedly to separate the patriots and the communists, and as the night wore on, that became increasingly more difficult to do.
[00:45:20.472 --> 00:45:22.213]  Oh, what the f***?
[00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:29.631]  Hey!
[00:45:29.651 --> 00:45:30.492]  Get out!
[00:45:30.712 --> 00:45:32.374]  We got your shields!
[00:45:32.394 --> 00:45:32.474]  USA!
[00:45:32.494 --> 00:45:32.654]  USA!
[00:45:32.754 --> 00:45:32.854]  USA!

[00:45:46.486 --> 00:45:46.546]  USA!
[00:45:46.566 --> 00:45:46.646]  USA!
[00:45:46.686 --> 00:45:46.766]  USA!

[00:45:47.306 --> 00:45:47.426]  USA!
[00:45:47.467 --> 00:45:47.527]  USA!
[00:45:47.547 --> 00:45:47.667]  USA!
[00:45:47.687 --> 00:45:47.907]  USA!
[00:45:48.107 --> 00:45:48.167]  USA!
[00:45:48.187 --> 00:45:48.307]  USA!
[00:45:48.327 --> 00:45:48.387]  USA!
[00:45:48.407 --> 00:45:48.467]  USA!
[00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:51.370]  USA!
[00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.550]  USA!
[00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:51.650]  USA!
[00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.830]  USA!
[00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:51.910]  USA!
[00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:51.990]  USA!
[00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.091]  USA!
[00:45:52.151 --> 00:45:52.251]  USA!
[00:45:52.967 --> 00:45:53.287]  Yes!
[00:45:53.388 --> 00:45:53.628]  Hey!
[00:45:53.708 --> 00:45:53.948]  No!
[00:45:54.129 --> 00:45:55.771]  I'm ready to go!
[00:45:55.911 --> 00:45:56.512]  I'm ready!
[00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:14.829]  The media will spin all of the events in this report as right-wing extremism.
[00:46:14.929 --> 00:46:25.555]  Intimidation and threats to election officials and lawmakers are feeding fears about violence amid calls by President Trump supporters to stop the certification of election results.
[00:46:25.855 --> 00:46:30.758]  But at this point, even they know it's simply Americans fighting for their lives.
[00:46:41.705 --> 00:46:43.946]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:47:18.564 --> 00:47:18.984]  Alright, folks.
[00:47:19.065 --> 00:47:20.046]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.066 --> 00:47:22.388]  It's Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex the second hour.
[00:47:22.528 --> 00:47:24.670]  We'll continue in just one minute, folks.
[00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:25.351]  Stay with us.
[00:47:25.651 --> 00:47:29.636]  Remember, this is InfoWars, brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:47:29.676 --> 00:47:30.156]  Go there now.
[00:47:30.216 --> 00:47:31.237]  Do your Christmas shopping.
[00:47:31.277 --> 00:47:34.941]  Keep us alive in this fight to destroy the New World Order.
[00:47:34.981 --> 00:47:35.522]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:47.634 --> 00:47:49.376]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:49.456 --> 00:47:56.104]  It's the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.com brought to you exclusively by InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:47:56.204 --> 00:48:00.489]  Something to remember in these days where small businesses are shutting down left and right.
[00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:03.012]  InfoWars is in fact a small business.
[00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:04.394]  We have a single owner.
[00:48:04.454 --> 00:48:06.696]  We're not part of some massive conglomerate.
[00:48:06.736 --> 00:48:14.803]  We're not owned by Univision, that's in turn owned by Time Warner, that's in turn owned by Goldman Sachs, which is in turn owned by BlackRock.
[00:48:14.843 --> 00:48:15.083]  No, no.
[00:48:15.283 --> 00:48:15.763]  None of that.
[00:48:16.244 --> 00:48:17.705]  No, we're a small independent business.
[00:48:17.745 --> 00:48:19.687]  We aren't even sponsored by those people.
[00:48:19.727 --> 00:48:22.229]  We don't even take their commercials on our programs.
[00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:38.136]  Now everything you see here, all of the political activism that you see in Washington D.C., the two massive, unparalleled expressions of patriotism with the Million MAGA March and the Jericho March and all of the marches yesterday, all of that,
[00:48:38.716 --> 00:48:47.583]  All of InfoWars' activities, all of our broadcasts, all of our publications, the website, absolutely every- even the development of Band.Video!
[00:48:47.623 --> 00:48:59.351]  I mean, it's incredible what we've been able to achieve, and when I say we, I mean all of us, not just here at InfoWars, but you out there as well, by sharing the stories, by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com, by supporting us or praying for us.
[00:48:59.612 --> 00:49:01.053]  We have all done this together, so...
[00:49:01.593 --> 00:49:05.155]  It's incredible what we've been able to achieve, but folks, we're just getting started.
[00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:16.223]  People are just waking up, as President Trump tweeted out yesterday, quoting the founder of the American Navy, and of course, Alex Jones says it all the time, we have just begun to fight.
[00:49:16.823 --> 00:49:20.366]  Or in another way, if you're looking for a fight, you better believe you got one.
[00:49:20.386 --> 00:49:26.830]  And you know, it's interesting, as I go through all of these stories that we have in front of me today, I'm once again sort of
[00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:32.587]  Having trouble figuring out how to put them into different categories.
[00:49:33.067 --> 00:49:34.648]  You've got China over here.
[00:49:34.968 --> 00:49:36.729]  You've got the election over here.
[00:49:36.749 --> 00:49:38.049]  You've got them stealing the election.
[00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.850]  You've got Biden.
[00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:41.591]  But then you've got Biden and his engagement with China.
[00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:45.352]  And then you've got China influencing YouTube to censor things about Biden.
[00:49:45.672 --> 00:49:46.693]  It's all interconnected.
[00:49:46.713 --> 00:49:51.175]  And this is why it can be so complicated to express some of this stuff at times, because
[00:49:52.495 --> 00:49:53.416]  You can't just say one thing.
[00:49:53.436 --> 00:49:54.356]  You can't just point out one thing.
[00:49:54.376 --> 00:49:57.477]  You point out one thing, and hey, that doesn't sound great, but it's probably just one person.
[00:49:57.758 --> 00:50:04.521]  Never attribute to malice what can be explained by a big ol' oopsie, by an accident, yet another glitch.
[00:50:05.301 --> 00:50:10.764]  You know, I'm doing a... I'm working on a year in review, and it's... it's insurmountable.
[00:50:10.804 --> 00:50:17.567]  I mean, just the sheer number of stories that came out, just the sheer number of stuff that happened this year is almost impossible to quantify.
[00:50:18.688 --> 00:50:19.228]  But, uh...
[00:50:21.026 --> 00:50:22.948]  Anyway, it's almost impossible.
[00:50:22.988 --> 00:50:25.831]  So you have to try to draw the lines between everything.
[00:50:26.312 --> 00:50:34.661]  So where we're going to start here is with one overarching theme that you find suffused in all of these stories, and that's hypocrisy.
[00:50:35.102 --> 00:50:37.324]  Overwhelming hypocrisy.
[00:50:37.925 --> 00:50:40.728]  Complete lies told with a straight face.
[00:50:41.869 --> 00:50:42.550]  Shocking, really?
[00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:44.251]  When you see some of these pictures?
[00:50:44.431 --> 00:50:45.692]  Here's a story from NewsWars.com.
[00:50:46.053 --> 00:50:46.973]  Unity in healing!
[00:50:47.294 --> 00:50:50.376]  Joe Biden posts pictures of dogs tearing up a Trump doll.
[00:50:51.477 --> 00:50:52.338]  From NewsWars.com.
[00:50:53.019 --> 00:51:00.345]  In another show of hypocrisy from Biden, the Instagram account for his dogs, Major and Champ, posted a picture of the pups playing tug-o-war with a Trump rag doll.
[00:51:01.223 --> 00:51:07.369]  What he's previously said is, quote, when the campaign is over, it's time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.
[00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:10.312]  It's time for America to unite and to heal.
[00:51:10.833 --> 00:51:15.478]  Oh, by the way, here is a picture of my dogs tearing Donald Trump apart.
[00:51:15.998 --> 00:51:17.240]  Yeah, unity and healing.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.681]  Wonderful stuff.
[00:51:18.881 --> 00:51:21.124]  Thank you, Mr. President-elect.
[00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:26.266]  It's absurd but it's not just the rhetoric and of course we've seen the rhetoric all over the place.
[00:51:26.286 --> 00:51:27.608]  We've seen it for the last four years.
[00:51:27.628 --> 00:51:29.731]  We saw it before Trump even got into office.
[00:51:29.751 --> 00:51:33.597]  We saw it during the 2016 election campaign.
[00:51:34.819 --> 00:51:35.440]  But this is not
[00:51:37.305 --> 00:51:38.446]  This is not fear-mongering.
[00:51:38.466 --> 00:51:41.527]  This is not to say, oh my gosh, they're coming for us.
[00:51:41.727 --> 00:51:43.889]  Oh, you know, they're going to come for you at night.
[00:51:43.929 --> 00:51:44.149]  No, no.
[00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:45.349]  They are making plans.
[00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.170]  They are telling you what they're going to do.
[00:51:47.531 --> 00:51:49.812]  So this is from the independent.co.uk.
[00:51:50.172 --> 00:51:54.274]  Will Trump be arrested as Biden gets sworn in as president?
[00:51:54.895 --> 00:51:57.636]  They say, imagine the scene come the 20th of January.
[00:51:57.656 --> 00:52:02.219]  It's a frigid day in Washington, both inside and outside the White House and Capitol.
[00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.240]  And throughout this story, they are
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:13.266]  They are writing a fantasy story about Donald Trump being arrested, but saying this is exactly what could actually happen.
[00:52:13.286 --> 00:52:16.749]  They say, you know, Joe Biden is there being inaugurated.
[00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:18.170]  Trump isn't at the inauguration.
[00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:22.052]  He's flying off to Florida to start his new life as a citizen.
[00:52:22.092 --> 00:52:29.418]  They say once Trump and Melania walk down the mobile stairs off of Air Force One, or what would then be Executive One, since he would no longer be the president,
[00:52:30.703 --> 00:52:35.989]  As Trump and Melania walk down the mobile stairs and onto the Florida soil to begin the next phase of their lives, there's confusion.
[00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.593]  Where will the questioning take place?
[00:52:40.273 --> 00:52:58.060]  After a heated scuffle caught on camera by tens of local, national and international media outlets on hand at Palm Beach International Airport to chronicle his return to civilian life, the FBI team and the Secret Service detail agree he'll ride in the USS Suburban with the federal agent's vehicles falling in behind in a mixed motorcade.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:03.963]  Imagine the split screens on television across the country and the world on one side, a smiling and ebullient
[00:53:04.443 --> 00:53:06.325]  Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.
[00:53:06.365 --> 00:53:10.510]  He's waving to supporters as he prepares to enter the Oval Office as president for the first time.
[00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:23.244]  On the other, a dour-faced and angry Donald John Trump is seen tapping on his iPhone and then yelling at someone unlucky enough to be on the other side of his first phone call as an official federal criminal suspect.
[00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:26.669]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:53:26.689 --> 00:53:27.490]  I mean, it's a fantasy.
[00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:31.171]  I mean, you can see the person drooling out of their mouth while they write this.
[00:53:31.211 --> 00:53:36.733]  I mean, this is their fantasy that they're portraying, but this is based on real cases.
[00:53:36.793 --> 00:53:38.413]  This is based on a reality.
[00:53:38.453 --> 00:53:47.537]  This is based on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and several other members of the United States government saying, we must prosecute Trump and his supporters the minute he's out of office.
[00:53:48.357 --> 00:53:51.458]  So I hope Republicans understand the threat that they are under.
[00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:54.632]  I hope Trump understands the threat that he's under.
[00:53:54.853 --> 00:53:56.134]  That this will not just go away.
[00:53:56.154 --> 00:54:09.843]  That once the election is over, if Joe Biden gets into office, which I think is increasingly rare, the likelihood that that would happen, but if that does take place, they're going to come after you with everything they can.
[00:54:10.104 --> 00:54:11.565]  And for the American people out there,
[00:54:12.205 --> 00:54:13.566]  Don't think you're going to get off the hook.
[00:54:13.666 --> 00:54:18.308]  Don't think you're going to be let off for supporting the person that they have determined is a criminal.
[00:54:18.348 --> 00:54:27.533]  So right now, there are at least 12 federal and state investigations into Trump, his 2016 campaign, and his business dealings, according to a list compiled by the New York Times.
[00:54:27.793 --> 00:54:29.394]  So, our country is dead.
[00:54:29.614 --> 00:54:31.015]  I hope everybody realizes that.
[00:54:31.075 --> 00:54:36.637]  The idea of a free and fair republic based on a constitution is over.
[00:54:37.158 --> 00:54:40.259]  They're openly talking about political prosecutions.
[00:54:40.539 --> 00:54:41.240]  Persecutions.
[00:54:42.093 --> 00:54:54.658]  They're going to use every ounce of power that they're granted by their sheep-like, zombie, zombified followers who vote for these people for God knows what reason.
[00:54:54.678 --> 00:54:59.600]  They're going to use every ounce of power that they're given to target us with everything that they've got.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:04.682]  Anybody that ever supported Trump, anybody that looks like Trump, anybody that Trump's ever had business with.
[00:55:04.722 --> 00:55:06.422]  By the way, I don't know if you remember this.
[00:55:06.482 --> 00:55:10.484]  Again, we're going back into the past, which is so difficult to do these days.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:15.082]  With the media lying and obfuscating everything that has come before.
[00:55:16.262 --> 00:55:18.323]  In true 1984 style.
[00:55:20.424 --> 00:55:21.905]  Four years of investigation.
[00:55:22.365 --> 00:55:33.330]  Two years of unregulated, unlimited, $50 million of investigation into Trump and everybody who ever talked to anybody that ever talked to Trump.
[00:55:33.891 --> 00:55:35.011]  We've had these investigations.
[00:55:35.271 --> 00:55:35.932]  That's not enough.
[00:55:36.272 --> 00:55:37.452]  They're gonna find something.
[00:55:37.693 --> 00:55:40.374]  They're gonna go in there and find something to try to pin on Donald Trump.
[00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.869]  I'm
[00:55:59.201 --> 00:56:06.585]  A congresswoman, I guess, from, uh, I think Milwaukee, come out and say, you know, the soldiers, her soldiers need to make Trump supporters pay.
[00:56:06.805 --> 00:56:11.548]  Just the latest in a long line of thinly veiled threats at Trump supporters.
[00:56:12.408 --> 00:56:20.293]  This guy named Tom Elliott tried to post that video showing that threat, showing her making threats to Trump supporters on a political basis.
[00:56:21.433 --> 00:56:24.335]  Something that should be treated as treason and should be punished accordingly.
[00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:29.852]  But he says YouTube doesn't want people knowing about Democratic lawmakers threatening the lives of Trump voters.
[00:56:29.912 --> 00:56:31.272]  Not newsworthy, I guess.
[00:56:31.312 --> 00:56:41.136]  And he posts a screenshot of a message from YouTube to him saying, hi, our team has reviewed your content and unfortunately we think it violates our violent criminal organizations policy.
[00:56:41.517 --> 00:56:43.817]  We've removed the following content from YouTube.
[00:56:43.858 --> 00:56:49.500]  The video was, quote, make them pay Michigan Democratic State Rep Cynthia Jones threatens Trump supporters.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:59.306]  So they can make threats to you, they can call their supporters out to punish you for your political beliefs, try to post evidence of that, and YouTube will take it down.
[00:56:59.666 --> 00:57:05.050]  I don't know if YouTube is calling the Democratic Party a violent criminal organization, but I think that would be giving them too much credit.
[00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:08.131]  I don't think they're aware enough to understand that that's exactly what they are.
[00:57:08.451 --> 00:57:16.515]  I think they just use any excuse at hand to destroy any messages that go counter to the narrative, the false narrative, that they're trying to portray.
[00:57:17.055 --> 00:57:21.357]  So we're entering into very dangerous, uncharted waters as a nation and as a world.
[00:57:21.857 --> 00:57:22.718]  Especially as a nation.
[00:57:22.758 --> 00:57:24.619]  Here in the United States, I don't know if we've ever
[00:57:25.619 --> 00:57:28.782]  I mean, even during the Civil War, weren't people a little bit smarter than this?
[00:57:29.382 --> 00:57:33.526]  Were there really these types of open threats to imprison the sitting president?
[00:57:34.207 --> 00:57:36.508]  Trump, if he knows what's good for him, he'll never leave that office.
[00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:43.995]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:57:44.913 --> 00:57:49.079]  Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones as he's in Washington, D.C.
[00:57:49.259 --> 00:57:51.382]  spearheading the movement and the march.
[00:57:51.842 --> 00:57:55.747]  Quite literally spearheading the march to save this republic.
[00:57:56.656 --> 00:57:59.738]  Truly heroic stuff going on across the nation right now.
[00:58:00.399 --> 00:58:03.901]  Very, very honored to be sitting in this chair and sharing this news with you.
[00:58:03.921 --> 00:58:11.986]  Of course, the main story of the day, the big story of the day is these leaked files exposing mass infiltration of firms all over the world by the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:58:12.006 --> 00:58:12.787]  And we'll get to that.
[00:58:13.027 --> 00:58:24.174]  We're taking a meandering path here because, as I said in the last segment, all of these different topics, all these different categories are all very intricately intertwined.
[00:58:24.615 --> 00:58:26.096]  So, of course, we start with the idea that
[00:58:26.956 --> 00:58:28.477]  Joe Biden is actually the president-elect.
[00:58:28.497 --> 00:58:29.658]  Well, he's not.
[00:58:30.078 --> 00:58:31.939]  Those votes will be cast actually tomorrow.
[00:58:31.979 --> 00:58:39.364]  The 14th of December will be when the electoral votes are actually cast, but it's not until the 6th of January that those are counted.
[00:58:39.384 --> 00:58:44.748]  In the meantime, there are multiple court cases, including that Texas Supreme Court case being refiled.
[00:58:45.028 --> 00:58:50.631]  There's a movement that could be made with Mike Pence as vice president choosing to throw out contested votes.
[00:58:50.671 --> 00:58:54.294]  There's lots of paths to victory yet available, including
[00:58:55.174 --> 00:59:10.802]  And the sort of last resort path, the pulling the pin on the grenade path of martial law, which at the greatest reach is necessary.
[00:59:11.262 --> 00:59:12.123]  And hopefully it doesn't get to that.
[00:59:12.803 --> 00:59:17.506]  Pray to God that it doesn't actually have to come to that, that some of these Republicans and some of the state houses
[00:59:18.737 --> 00:59:19.237]  We're good to go.
[00:59:41.027 --> 00:59:44.069]  Stories coming out about mail-in balloting.
[00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:51.354]  But if all of that fails, then at least we have that final stopgap measure of martial law, and hopefully we don't have to get there.
[00:59:52.455 --> 00:59:55.437]  But frankly, it could be worse.
[00:59:55.737 --> 00:59:56.257]  It could be worse.
[00:59:56.297 --> 00:59:58.559]  We could be taken over by Chinese communists.
[00:59:58.599 --> 01:00:02.982]  We could be completely usurped by globalist slave masters.
[01:00:03.242 --> 01:00:06.264]  So, martial law, a little bit preferable to that, in my personal opinion.
[01:00:07.588 --> 01:00:13.429]  So we start with the contested election, and we go on to see what Joe Biden is saying.
[01:00:13.449 --> 01:00:16.410]  Of course, he wants unity, by which he means subjugation.
[01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:23.811]  He wants togetherness, by which he means bend the knee, shut up, and let us abuse you without speaking out too much.
[01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:29.132]  And of course, he posts pictures of his dogs tearing apart a Trump doll.
[01:00:29.172 --> 01:00:35.093]  You have this Michigan lawmaker threatening the lives of Trump supporters.
[01:00:36.104 --> 01:00:50.034]  And then you have somebody trying to post that on YouTube, trying to make awareness of the fact that Democrats are complete hypocrites, total liars, and dangerously pushing us towards civil war as they refuse to behave in any sort of civilized manner whatsoever.
[01:00:51.018 --> 01:01:01.607]  He tries to post this video, this guy known on YouTube as Grabian, and YouTube says, no, no, no, you can't put videos of Democrats threatening Trump supporters.
[01:01:01.827 --> 01:01:04.329]  No, no, that's a violation of our terms of service.
[01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:07.852]  Yes, yet another example of this big tech censorship.
[01:01:08.112 --> 01:01:15.198]  Another rather outrageous overreach of the big tech ability to silence everyone and anyone who opposes their
[01:01:16.536 --> 01:01:17.457]  Insidious plans.
[01:01:18.057 --> 01:01:22.639]  Twitter briefly limits users interacting with Trump tweets about stolen election.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.881]  So Trump came out and said he believes that the election was stolen from him.
[01:01:27.722 --> 01:01:32.504]  And Twitter didn't let users like or retweet those assertions.
[01:01:32.584 --> 01:01:44.491]  And you also really have to pay attention to this because anytime you see one of these little labels under one of Trump's tweets or anybody's tweet, a lot of times it's under a tweet of an opinion.
[01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:47.887]  You have to understand, that's what censorship is.
[01:01:49.628 --> 01:01:50.749]  It's not just about... There you go.
[01:01:50.769 --> 01:01:51.950]  Most corrupt election in U.S.
[01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:52.290]  history.
[01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:54.051]  The claim about election fraud is disputed.
[01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:56.733]  See, this is where their power levels are now.
[01:01:57.154 --> 01:01:58.915]  Right now, they can put a little label on it.
[01:01:58.955 --> 01:02:00.696]  They're scared to go any farther than that.
[01:02:01.196 --> 01:02:08.462]  Give them institutional power, elect them into office, and that same standard of fact-checking will be applied to your opinions.
[01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:10.182]  This is what you need to understand.
[01:02:10.202 --> 01:02:12.623]  It has nothing to do with so-called fact-checking.
[01:02:13.223 --> 01:02:20.225]  Just like YouTube didn't remove that video because it showed violence, you know, criminalized, organized violence.
[01:02:20.585 --> 01:02:22.846]  It didn't show that, but that was the excuse they used to bring it down.
[01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:31.569]  And so, when these people get the power that they want, if they're allowed to achieve the heights of control that they're reaching for,
[01:02:32.429 --> 01:02:34.250]  They will use that same standard.
[01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.470]  So you have to understand this.
[01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:37.471]  It won't matter if it's factual or not.
[01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.932]  It will matter whether it serves them or not.
[01:02:40.032 --> 01:02:43.433]  It can be your opinion, they'll say that's false, and they'll censor you for it.
[01:02:43.473 --> 01:02:55.437]  Right now they're doing it on Twitter, but give them institutional power, give them total control of the government, give them what they want, and they'll use that same standard to destroy every aspect of your speech.
[01:02:55.837 --> 01:02:56.798]  So it's worth paying attention to.
[01:02:57.745 --> 01:03:01.889]  YouTube's also removing videos about questioning Biden's election victory.
[01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:07.634]  Google-owned video platform YouTube has announced plans to remove any content that questions Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 U.S.
[01:03:07.674 --> 01:03:12.199]  presidential election, despite the fact that legal challenges involving multiple states continue.
[01:03:12.579 --> 01:03:17.604]  YouTube also announced it will be promoting authoritative news sources such as NBC and CBS in video recommendations.
[01:03:18.385 --> 01:03:21.788]  Not new, but definitely an escalation of their previous practices.
[01:03:21.968 --> 01:03:22.769]  I think that's obvious.
[01:03:24.304 --> 01:03:25.064]  It's truly incredible.
[01:03:25.124 --> 01:03:34.847]  And, you know, it happened with Kyle Rittenhouse, it happened with several other situations where you have arguments being made, sometimes being made in front of the Senate, sometimes being made in courthouses.
[01:03:36.447 --> 01:03:50.831]  If you can make an argument in a court, if you can make an argument in front of the Senate, but that same argument gets deleted from major free speech platforms, major platforms like YouTube and Twitter and Facebook, they are superseding the American government.
[01:03:51.451 --> 01:04:06.545]  And of course the people they adhere to, the people they bow to, are not elected, they're not responsible to a public that they serve, they're completely independent, their ambitions are their own, the reasons they do things are completely on their own, and you don't have a say over that.
[01:04:07.285 --> 01:04:13.591]  But they, in many ways, supersede the court, supersede any sort of national safeguards that we have.
[01:04:14.957 --> 01:04:17.198]  And so this brings us to sort of back around.
[01:04:17.739 --> 01:04:26.924]  And again, we're all we're sort of in a we're in a big Venn diagram of the Biden election, the Biden presidency, the stolen election, China, big tech.
[01:04:27.184 --> 01:04:28.305]  And we're here right in the middle.
[01:04:28.705 --> 01:04:28.985]  You know, it.
[01:04:30.126 --> 01:04:32.267]  At the intersection of hypocrisy, okay?
[01:04:32.888 --> 01:04:36.790]  Biden transition quietly brings on Facebook and Google employees.
[01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:43.553]  When the Biden transition team released the names of hundreds of personnel on November 10th, there were zero current Facebook or Google employees among them.
[01:04:43.833 --> 01:04:44.514]  That's changed.
[01:04:44.554 --> 01:04:52.298]  The transition website quietly added four Facebook and Google employees to its agency review team on or close to Thanksgiving.
[01:04:52.998 --> 01:04:58.002]  Zayed Zayed, a Facebook public policy official, joined the State Department and international development teams.
[01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:02.206]  Christopher Upperman, a Facebook manager, was added to the Small Business Administration team.
[01:05:04.014 --> 01:05:08.836]  A Facebook director and associate general counsel now sits on the intelligence community team.
[01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:16.520]  Dion Scott, a Google programmer and manager and alum of Obama's Homeland Security Department, will serve on the DHS team.
[01:05:17.161 --> 01:05:29.707]  Silicon Valley critics have pressured the incoming administration not to hire people with ties to the tech industry, to the senior post, particularly individuals associated with Facebook and Google, which are fending off massive antitrust lawsuits.
[01:05:30.666 --> 01:05:36.427]  Long story short, there is massive overlap between Big Tech and the incoming Biden administration.
[01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:43.069]  The administration, and when I say things like incoming Biden administration, just know there's sarcastic quotes around that.
[01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:44.649]  Please put those in yourself.
[01:05:44.769 --> 01:05:45.510]  Add those in yourself.
[01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:50.831]  Massive overlap to the administration that they have censored.
[01:05:51.792 --> 01:05:52.172]  I think so.
[01:06:16.852 --> 01:06:18.293]  Welcome back, folks, to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:18.313 --> 01:06:22.414]  Harrison Smith sitting in today for Alex Jones, who is still in Washington, D.C.
[01:06:22.935 --> 01:06:37.781]  In the last segment, I talked about some of the newly revealed big tech insiders that will now be a part of Biden's team and the way that those were secretly sort of slipped in after the announcement was made of who would be in his transition team.
[01:06:37.801 --> 01:06:42.823]  They then later sort of added, just sort of slipped in these big tech insiders into this.
[01:06:42.843 --> 01:06:44.904]  But of course, we've known about this for a long time.
[01:06:45.264 --> 01:06:46.145]  Breitbart.com.
[01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:48.322]  From mid-November.
[01:06:49.568 --> 01:07:09.862]  According to the Financial Times, presidential contender Biden has hired both Jessica Hertz, a former associate general counsel at Facebook, Cynthia Hogan, former Apple vice president for government affairs to his transition team, Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive, has been a big fundraiser and is being talked about to lead a new technology industry task force in the White House.
[01:07:09.902 --> 01:07:19.248]  So all of these people that are censoring you, all of these people that are working hand in hand with Communist China, all of these people that are telling you it's literally a sin for you to have free speech,
[01:07:20.088 --> 01:07:22.530]  Tim Cook in Apple, Eric Schmidt in Google.
[01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:28.613]  They're going to have official government positions under the Biden campaign that they helped to bring about.
[01:07:28.773 --> 01:07:29.994]  This is crony capitalism.
[01:07:30.314 --> 01:07:33.696]  This is the mafia that is seeking to rule all of our lives.
[01:07:34.416 --> 01:07:40.880]  Another thing that was revealed yesterday, Facebook's fact-checking czar just happens to be a Hillary Clinton fangirl.
[01:07:42.028 --> 01:07:54.952]  As if we needed more evidence that Facebook is biased against conservatives, it appears that the person in charge of deciding which entities are allowed to be fact-checkers for the social media site might not be as fair of an arbiter of content moderation as the company wants us to think.
[01:07:55.372 --> 01:07:56.292]  Oh, you don't say.
[01:07:56.312 --> 01:07:57.632]  Aw, jeez, what?
[01:07:57.972 --> 01:07:59.233]  Facebook being dishonest?
[01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:00.454]  I hope so.
[01:08:18.445 --> 01:08:34.931]  And American University School of Communication professor Margot Suska is unashamedly politically biased, but she was responsible for issuing 19 fact check licenses or reviews for organizations to become fact checkers.
[01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:42.234]  They include Check Your Fact, Associated Press, Decryptors, Lead Stories, MediaWise, and The Dispatch.
[01:08:43.803 --> 01:08:48.488]  Suska has made appearances on news outlets criticizing President Trump, saying, I've been on Team Hillary since 08.
[01:08:49.509 --> 01:08:55.576]  In a conversation with Russia Today, Suska admitted that she has difficulty being objective about President Trump.
[01:08:55.596 --> 01:09:01.402]  She said, quote, it is hard for me to be an objective observer of the presidential administration for when years now
[01:09:02.143 --> 01:09:08.968]  They have continually tried to delegitimize and marginalize news reporters for doing their constitutionally protected job.
[01:09:08.988 --> 01:09:16.794]  Despite Siska's obvious bias, Facebook has given her power to decide which organizations be allowed to moderate content on the site.
[01:09:17.495 --> 01:09:19.216]  Truly, truly incredible.
[01:09:19.236 --> 01:09:21.958]  She's like, yes, I'm an extreme partisan.
[01:09:22.218 --> 01:09:23.980]  I think everything Donald Trump does is a
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.881]  There's a major threat to democracy?
[01:09:27.281 --> 01:09:30.823]  Oh, well great, go ahead and put her in charge of who's allowed to say things on Facebook.
[01:09:30.963 --> 01:09:31.663]  That's fantastic.
[01:09:32.604 --> 01:09:33.844]  YouTube, Facebook, they're all the same.
[01:09:33.864 --> 01:09:36.546]  YouTube deletes comments critical of Chinese Communist Party.
[01:09:36.586 --> 01:09:40.347]  And this was actually sort of a scandal a little while ago, but it's resurfaced.
[01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:44.890]  YouTube has been deleting comments critical of China's ruling party due to a software flaw.
[01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:46.971]  Yeah, just another little flaw, another little glitch.
[01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:49.572]  I actually was going to mention this earlier.
[01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:56.896]  When I do put together my year in review, I want you to take a shot every time a glitch goes in the favor of the Democrats.
[01:09:57.076 --> 01:09:58.476]  You'll be drunk by February.
[01:09:58.937 --> 01:09:59.257]  Alright?
[01:09:59.817 --> 01:10:11.623]  Every glitch, every software malfunction, every accident that happens in big tech or election engineering or just anything ever, every accident, every oopsie-daisy,
[01:10:12.503 --> 01:10:13.423]  is in one direction.
[01:10:13.784 --> 01:10:15.184]  It favors the Democrats.
[01:10:15.284 --> 01:10:18.786]  God, man, they must think we're really dumb, don't they?
[01:10:18.826 --> 01:10:27.550]  They really think we're so stupid that they can just go, ah, oopsie, every time they're caught, every single time they're caught, they're like, ah, turns out it was a glitch.
[01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:29.250]  Just another one of those glitches.
[01:10:29.511 --> 01:10:30.131]  Gosh darn it.
[01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:32.052]  And it's been going on the entire year.
[01:10:32.092 --> 01:10:34.593]  So, yes, it was a software flaw.
[01:10:35.595 --> 01:10:42.119]  The company said on Tuesday in response to criticism of the practice, the spokesperson said the issue was not the result of a policy change.
[01:10:42.399 --> 01:10:50.464]  Some comments posted in the Chinese language such as communist bandit or 50 cent party, a derogatory term for the ruling party, were deleted within seconds.
[01:10:50.845 --> 01:10:54.647]  YouTube's automatic filters eliminate contents that violate company policies.
[01:10:55.248 --> 01:10:57.189]  Very, very interesting.
[01:10:57.409 --> 01:10:59.250]  Just yet another one of these little glitches.
[01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:00.271]  Of course, YouTube
[01:11:01.414 --> 01:11:08.117]  There was speculation, that is, that there was outside influence, that somebody was maybe taking advantage of the way YouTube was set up.
[01:11:08.137 --> 01:11:16.121]  Maybe you had 10,000 Chinese people in a bot farm somewhere who were just, you know, automatically tagging anything that came up.
[01:11:16.161 --> 01:11:16.621]  But no, no, no.
[01:11:16.741 --> 01:11:20.262]  YouTube has clarified it did not happen from any sort of outside force.
[01:11:20.703 --> 01:11:23.824]  They say it was caused by internal activity.
[01:11:25.376 --> 01:11:27.177]  Okay, yeah, of course they say it was an accident.
[01:11:27.237 --> 01:11:29.198]  Oopsie-daisy, sorry, our bad.
[01:11:29.478 --> 01:11:35.001]  Although YouTube comments today offer more detail than previously supplied, they leave important questions unanswered.
[01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:38.623]  How exactly did this error enter the system and why did it go unnoticed for months?
[01:11:38.943 --> 01:11:46.647]  These aren't trivial issues as YouTube's lack of proper explanation has enabled political figures to accuse the company of bias towards the CCP.
[01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:47.647]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:11:47.907 --> 01:11:48.788]  The problem is that
[01:11:49.548 --> 01:11:52.290]  People are pointing out that they have a bias for the CCP.
[01:11:52.470 --> 01:12:05.997]  Yeah, it's a real big issue when YouTube is deleting comments that are critical of the Chinese Communist Party, who keep Uyghurs in slave camps, who enslave their own people in work camps for Apple and Nike and others.
[01:12:07.138 --> 01:12:12.601]  It's a real big problem when that's revealed, when it's revealed that China is censoring people who are against that sort of thing.
[01:12:13.735 --> 01:12:15.636]  From the Geller Report, maybe this explains it all.
[01:12:16.056 --> 01:12:21.260]  YouTube employs Chinese Communist State Secrecy Bureau software engineers.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:35.208]  A host of software engineers for the platform, YouTube, have formerly worked for the Chinese Communist Party-run institutions, raising the question as to why a revolving door exists between YouTube and the China-based universities.
[01:12:35.228 --> 01:12:41.052]  The software engineer for the video platform previously worked as a project manager for Guangzhou Xin Technology.
[01:12:41.952 --> 01:12:42.493]  I don't know.
[01:12:58.723 --> 01:13:09.153]  YouTube engineer led software efforts on behalf of the PLA, appearing to reference the China's People Liberation Army, the Communist Army, and a host of Chinese government-led intelligence bodies.
[01:13:09.454 --> 01:13:16.100]  What's more, he notes, he, quote, garnered numerous staff awards for excellent performance.
[01:13:16.561 --> 01:13:17.442]  And he's not the only one.
[01:13:17.482 --> 01:13:21.446]  It goes on to list employee after employee.
[01:13:22.321 --> 01:13:28.603]  Working at YouTube since February 2014, despite previously working as a developer for Beijing-based Peking University.
[01:13:28.663 --> 01:13:36.106]  Peking University, which has seen its researchers sentenced by the FBI for stealing intellectual property and failing to disclose Chinese Communist Party ties.
[01:13:36.186 --> 01:13:38.707]  It's funded and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:13:39.127 --> 01:13:40.408]  Fan Yang, another YouTube...
[01:13:40.928 --> 01:13:41.669]  So, as this article puts it...
[01:13:59.429 --> 01:14:01.871]  Revolving door between them and big tech.
[01:14:02.431 --> 01:14:06.654]  There's also a revolving door between Joe Biden's administration and big tech.
[01:14:06.694 --> 01:14:08.035]  It's all one revolving door.
[01:14:08.415 --> 01:14:09.056]  It's not a door.
[01:14:09.116 --> 01:14:10.997]  It's one big building and they all live in it.
[01:14:12.338 --> 01:14:12.958]  There is no door.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:24.967]  That leads us, of course, to the biggest story of the day, which is this leaked files expose a mass infiltration of UK firms by the China Chinese Communist Party.
[01:14:26.391 --> 01:14:29.094]  Party insiders in the ranks is the way the Australian puts it.
[01:14:29.114 --> 01:14:32.618]  The Chinese Communist Party has infiltrated the Australian, British and U.S.
[01:14:32.658 --> 01:14:41.367]  consulates in Shanghai with a government-run recruitment agency placing advisors into Western embassies for more than a decade.
[01:14:42.048 --> 01:14:55.151]  Foreign affairs experts warn the employment of China Communist Party members in the consulate, some for up to 16 years, could be a part of a state-sponsored spy ring, while intelligence officers labeled it a breach of protocol and a risk to national security.
[01:14:55.651 --> 01:15:10.835]  The database has also revealed that CCP members working in global companies such as Boeing, which has had billions of dollars in defense contracts, and inside Pfizer and AstraZeneca, pharmaceutical companies which are developing the coronavirus vaccines, and at Western universities.
[01:15:13.103 --> 01:15:16.846]  Is it all becoming clear to you what power we're up against?
[01:15:17.226 --> 01:15:18.907]  What the cabal looks like?
[01:15:19.868 --> 01:15:20.208]  I mean, it's...
[01:15:21.806 --> 01:15:22.527]  Truly incredible.
[01:15:22.567 --> 01:15:25.850]  I almost say unbelievable, but it's perfectly believable, isn't it?
[01:15:25.890 --> 01:15:35.259]  We've had at least 16 years, more like 40 years, of people in our government who hate the American people and are seeking to sell us out at every opportunity.
[01:15:35.499 --> 01:15:39.904]  So it's not that unbelievable that they would welcome in members of the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:15:39.944 --> 01:15:43.807]  They would brush aside any red flags that this might put up.
[01:15:44.628 --> 01:15:53.696]  Leaked files expose mass infiltration of UK firms by Chinese Communist Party, including AstraZeneca, Rolls-Royce, HSBC, and Jaguar Land Rover.
[01:15:54.036 --> 01:15:58.300]  Totally undetected for 16 years to a million Chinese agents.
[01:15:59.369 --> 01:16:01.752]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:02.092 --> 01:16:05.375]  My name is Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex today folks.
[01:16:06.036 --> 01:16:11.422]  I have to remind you everything you see here and of course the major trip to Washington DC.
[01:16:11.462 --> 01:16:17.147]  The several major trips we've taken over the last month to attempt to stop the steel bringing with us upwards of a million.
[01:16:17.788 --> 01:16:21.969]  Patriotic Americans to protest the blatant theft of their elections.
[01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:25.610]  All of this has been brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:29.311]  And might I suggest for the winter months, Winter Sun Plus.
[01:16:29.611 --> 01:16:31.712]  This is the D3 droplets.
[01:16:32.172 --> 01:16:35.233]  Get your extra ultimate vitamin D3.
[01:16:35.513 --> 01:16:42.135]  I do suggest that if you're looking for something to help you get through the winter and maintain your health as best as possible.
[01:16:42.155 --> 01:16:42.495]  And of course,
[01:16:43.456 --> 01:16:47.364]  Christmas is coming up and there are presents for everyone, even people that hate InfoWars.
[01:16:47.705 --> 01:16:50.130]  They'll love our presents and they don't have to know where you got it.
[01:16:51.263 --> 01:16:54.105]  They don't have to know where that amazing air filter came from.
[01:16:54.505 --> 01:16:55.405]  You don't have to tell them.
[01:16:55.465 --> 01:17:15.036]  Or you can tell them, and let them know, hey, these guys that you think are crazy conspiracy theorists, that you think are hateful bigots, that are all your Ottola stuff, hey, it turns out they're just really into health, and human activity, and helping people to live their best lives, and to be safe, and free, and independent in an increasingly slavish world.
[01:17:15.916 --> 01:17:17.837]  So InfoWarsStore.com is how we do all of this.
[01:17:17.877 --> 01:17:20.159]  And we're going to circle back, like I said we were.
[01:17:20.319 --> 01:17:36.230]  We're going to, as we've meandered on through the stolen election, to the violence being perpetrated, to the big tech censoring that violence, to big tech being in bed with the Chinese communists, to, it turns out, everybody's in bed with the Chinese communists with this incredible leak.
[01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:37.571]  The story from NationalFile.com.
[01:17:47.237 --> 01:17:48.037]  We're good to go.
[01:18:04.707 --> 01:18:05.447]  Exclusive U.S.
[01:18:05.507 --> 01:18:08.868]  Treasury breached by hackers backed by foreign government sources.
[01:18:09.548 --> 01:18:12.950]  A sophisticated hacking group backed by a foreign government stole information from the U.S.
[01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:14.250]  Treasury Department and a U.S.
[01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:20.172]  agency responsible for deciding policy around the Internet and telecommunications, according to people familiar with this matter.
[01:18:20.232 --> 01:18:24.873]  That is all the information we have out of Reuters from a hack that occurred today.
[01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:27.194]  They don't tell us which foreign government it is, but let's
[01:18:27.694 --> 01:18:30.196]  Let's put all the pieces together, shall we, and speculate.
[01:18:30.216 --> 01:18:32.137]  Eh, it's probably the Communist Chinese.
[01:18:32.217 --> 01:18:33.739]  Probably the Communist Chinese.
[01:18:33.779 --> 01:18:34.539]  Probably not Russia.
[01:18:34.559 --> 01:18:37.101]  I'm going to come out and say, probably not Russia.
[01:18:37.241 --> 01:18:37.562]  Okay?
[01:18:38.222 --> 01:18:41.825]  And this is a lesson that we've had to learn over and over again for the last four years.
[01:18:43.066 --> 01:18:44.207]  But lo and behold...
[01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:50.533]  Yet another confirmation of what we here at InfoWars have been talking about forever.
[01:18:50.613 --> 01:18:54.276]  Hunter Biden, President-elect's son, says federal prosecutors probing his taxes.
[01:18:54.936 --> 01:19:01.220]  I want to take a moment to really reflect on this headline and its subtitle.
[01:19:01.801 --> 01:19:02.361]  Here's the headline.
[01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:08.185]  Hunter Biden, the President-elect's son, says federal prosecutors are probing his taxes.
[01:19:08.725 --> 01:19:09.486]  Here's the subtext.
[01:19:10.407 --> 01:19:20.355]  The probe was revealed weeks after an election in which President Donald Trump and his allies made unfounded and baseless claims of corruption regarding Hunter Biden and his father.
[01:19:21.816 --> 01:19:31.545]  So, if you're a normal person and you can read these two headlines and not have an aneurysm just from sheer cognitive dissidence,
[01:19:32.543 --> 01:19:37.146]  I'm not sure my explanation will do any more to further your ability to think critically.
[01:19:37.847 --> 01:19:40.608]  Because this is so obvious, it should be like a slap in the face.
[01:19:41.629 --> 01:19:41.809]  Right?
[01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:47.093]  Oh, he is under investigation, but the claims he was under investigation were unfounded.
[01:19:47.373 --> 01:19:49.634]  That's literally what they're telling you.
[01:19:49.714 --> 01:19:54.658]  You have to be dumb as a brick to actually believe this.
[01:19:54.858 --> 01:19:59.481]  To actually absorb this level of hypocrisy, this level of just blatant
[01:20:00.774 --> 01:20:06.917]  Obfuscation and not have some part of your brain set off an alarm that goes, hey, they're lying to you.
[01:20:06.977 --> 01:20:07.838]  Hey, they're full of crap.
[01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:13.000]  Hey, take everything they say with a grain of salt because they clearly are hiding something from you.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:14.861]  It's just incredible, isn't it?
[01:20:15.281 --> 01:20:18.743]  Hunter Biden says federal prosecutors are probing his taxes.
[01:20:18.763 --> 01:20:24.226]  This comes weeks after an election where Trump and his allies made unfounded and baseless claims of corruption.
[01:20:25.129 --> 01:20:31.323]  Unfounded and baseless claims that turned out to be well-founded and have a rock-solid base.
[01:20:33.066 --> 01:20:33.506]  Incredible.
[01:20:33.987 --> 01:20:38.991]  Hunter Biden, President-elect Joe Biden's son, said Wednesday federal officials in Delaware are investigating his taxes.
[01:20:39.031 --> 01:20:44.835]  This news came weeks after an election campaign in which President Donald Trump and his allies made unfounded, baseless claims of corruption.
[01:20:44.855 --> 01:20:45.876]  They just repeated it over and over.
[01:20:46.456 --> 01:20:55.483]  They also alleged that Hunter Biden used his father's influence to enrich himself through business deals in Ukraine and China, and that his father not only facilitated that, but may have benefited financially.
[01:20:56.104 --> 01:20:58.005]  Trump provided no evidence of this claim.
[01:20:58.025 --> 01:20:59.807]  Like, this is the type of crap they say.
[01:21:00.167 --> 01:21:02.789]  Trump provided no evidence for their claims.
[01:21:04.028 --> 01:21:10.310]  So, I mean, they expect you to believe that Trump just made something up out of thin air, and this is what they always do.
[01:21:10.330 --> 01:21:13.011]  They're always just like, God, no evidence, no foundation.
[01:21:13.031 --> 01:21:14.031]  They're just making it up.
[01:21:14.091 --> 01:21:16.352]  It's like, we don't just sit here and make things up.
[01:21:16.832 --> 01:21:17.932]  How dumb would that be?
[01:21:18.352 --> 01:21:24.014]  To sit here and go, gosh, let's say, I don't know, let's say Hunter Biden, internationals.
[01:21:24.054 --> 01:21:24.394]  I don't know.
[01:21:24.414 --> 01:21:26.815]  Let's just like throw something out there and let's just like lie about it.
[01:21:27.975 --> 01:21:28.556]  We don't do that.
[01:21:29.077 --> 01:21:29.938]  We just don't do that.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:39.595]  What we had was the New York Post receiving a laptop that showed incontrovertible proof that this is what was happening, and then we reported on that.
[01:21:41.186 --> 01:21:46.670]  But according to the NBC paper here, Trump provided no evidence, no evidence for the claim.
[01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:49.913]  Well, he and his family remained under ethical scrutiny.
[01:21:50.353 --> 01:21:54.516]  Yeah, they've been under scrutiny the entire time they've been in office and even beforehand.
[01:21:54.556 --> 01:22:02.402]  And absolutely nothing has come of it because they're not crooked in the way that Biden and his family certainly are.
[01:22:02.983 --> 01:22:07.426]  Let's do some little little couple little comparisons on this story, shall we?
[01:22:07.786 --> 01:22:10.468]  Just in case, again, like the liberals, your
[01:22:11.311 --> 01:22:12.468]  Memory is that of a goldfish.
[01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:14.335]  From Sam Stein.
[01:22:44.635 --> 01:22:48.176]  They'll take something that you have evidence for, and they'll say it's baseless and you have no evidence.
[01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:56.058]  You can publish that evidence in a major newspaper, in fact the oldest newspaper in existence in America, and they'll censor that.
[01:22:56.278 --> 01:22:56.998]  They'll delete that.
[01:22:57.138 --> 01:23:03.519]  Facebook literally came out and said, we have no information to counter this claim, but we're going to censor it anyway.
[01:23:03.839 --> 01:23:07.640]  Out of an overabundance of caution, we're going to go ahead and censor our political enemies.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:08.760]  It's for your safety.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.200]  Trust us.
[01:23:11.521 --> 01:23:12.121]  Truly incredible.
[01:23:13.035 --> 01:23:14.075]  Went largely unnoticed.
[01:23:14.215 --> 01:23:20.056]  So they'll censor that information, and then later when they're forced to admit it, they'll go, oh, it went largely unnoticed.
[01:23:20.557 --> 01:23:23.337]  It went largely unnoticed, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:24.017 --> 01:23:26.838]  Yeah, the corpse you buried in the woods, it went largely unnoticed.
[01:23:27.858 --> 01:23:31.379]  The trash you swept under the rug went largely unnoticed.
[01:23:31.399 --> 01:23:34.579]  No, you hid it from us, you absolute scoundrels.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.740]  Hunter Biden's story is Russian, this is so... Now let's look at political.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.721]  Let's look at one particular outlet, shall we?
[01:23:42.537 --> 01:23:48.159]  Here's the story recently, Hunter Biden's story, or no, this is the old one, I have these out of order, but it's fine, it works either way.
[01:23:48.439 --> 01:23:49.019]  Here's the old story.
[01:23:49.259 --> 01:23:53.720]  Hunter Biden's story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:24:03.283]  So this is when it came out, they censored it, they tried to say it was unsubstantiated, baseless, and then they went a step farther and said, no, actually it's Russian disinformation.
[01:24:03.363 --> 01:24:04.863]  That's right, that's how dumb they think you are.
[01:24:05.244 --> 01:24:09.665]  Hunter Biden's story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.
[01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:11.113]  Cut to... Oh dear!
[01:24:11.774 --> 01:24:13.175]  I mean, I mean, do you think...
[01:24:25.666 --> 01:24:26.486]  They believe this?
[01:24:27.246 --> 01:24:28.787]  Please tell me you don't think they believe this.
[01:24:28.967 --> 01:24:38.148]  Please tell me you don't think that the people running our major institutions and our major media outlets are this dumb, because they're not this dumb.
[01:24:38.368 --> 01:24:40.409]  They are this duplicitous.
[01:24:40.469 --> 01:24:42.289]  They are liars.
[01:24:42.889 --> 01:24:43.329]  So there you go.
[01:24:44.069 --> 01:24:48.050]  DOJ probe into Hunter Biden reportedly extends beyond Burisma to some other stuff.
[01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:52.671]  Hunter Biden requests keys for his new office mates, Joe Biden and a Chinese emissary.
[01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:55.957]  To the CEFC Chairman email show.
[01:24:56.538 --> 01:25:03.241]  Hunter Biden emails reportedly name Kamala Harris, others as key contracts for joint venture with China Energy Company.
[01:25:03.901 --> 01:25:09.204]  And of course, Joe Biden's brother under federal investigation for role in bankrupt healthcare firm.
[01:25:09.944 --> 01:25:15.467]  So basically everybody in Joe Biden's family, Joe Biden's running mate, and Joe Biden himself are all implicated in this.
[01:25:16.147 --> 01:25:20.770]  And it would have made a major difference if it had come out before the election in November.
[01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:22.991]  Big Tech did everything it could.
[01:25:24.226 --> 01:25:24.526]  I don't know.
[01:25:36.069 --> 01:25:36.469]  And that was it.
[01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.670]  And that was it.
[01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:38.610]  That was all they did.
[01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.870]  That's what happened.
[01:25:40.111 --> 01:25:42.351]  The story continued to be shadow banned.
[01:25:42.952 --> 01:25:45.272]  The New York Post continued to be banned outright.
[01:25:45.513 --> 01:25:47.433]  The story continued to be swept under the rug.
[01:25:47.693 --> 01:25:59.378]  And now that they've successfully captured the American election in their own estimation, they've successfully captured the American election, now they can come out and say, gosh, if only we'd known about this beforehand.
[01:26:00.018 --> 01:26:16.671]  The level of lies, level of cognitive dissonance, level of just absolute BS that we're being fed day after day, it makes a hell of a lot of sense that every one of our institutions is currently under occupation by two million highly motivated Chinese communists, doesn't it?
[01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:18.332]  Really incredible stuff, folks.
[01:26:18.772 --> 01:26:22.755]  The Sunday night election countdown starts in just one minute.
[01:26:23.176 --> 01:26:24.577]  Signing off, this is Harrison Smith.
[01:26:24.837 --> 01:26:27.439]  Tom Papert takes over for me on the other side, folks.
[01:26:27.459 --> 01:26:28.560]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:26:31.984 --> 01:26:38.486]  Look, all of my pitches to you are 100% straight up.
[01:26:38.786 --> 01:26:47.910]  I'm always a straight shooter, but with what's happening in the country in the last month of 2020, I'm just going to be completely honest.
[01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:50.311]  I need money to keep fighting the globalists.
[01:26:51.191 --> 01:26:54.333]  I need money to have this crew and to run this independent media operation.
[01:26:54.693 --> 01:26:55.473]  Let me explain something.
[01:26:57.254 --> 01:26:59.055]  Apple is a trillion dollar company.
[01:26:59.926 --> 01:27:01.988]  Google's like a $900 billion company.
[01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:10.338]  All those big tech companies have spent hundreds of billions of dollars to develop their own infrastructure.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.264]  I'm very proud of my five-man IT team.
[01:27:16.246 --> 01:27:20.750]  That we have banned on video and our own video platform that reaches like 10 million people a day.
[01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:30.199]  And we have our own streams, our own satellite uplinks for radio and TV, our own email servers, everything we have to do ourselves.
[01:27:30.259 --> 01:27:30.880]  I'm not a victim.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:31.440]  I'm not bitching.
[01:27:32.001 --> 01:27:40.369]  I'm just simply saying it took a lot with them deplatforming us three years ago and all the Democrat lawsuits and all the attacks.
[01:27:40.973 --> 01:27:44.496]  To stay on air to this moment, I spent basically almost everything I've got.
[01:27:44.516 --> 01:27:48.979]  I mortgaged my house because I knew it would come down to the wire right now.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:53.082]  And now people can see how close it is, this race against good versus evil.
[01:27:53.143 --> 01:27:53.323]  So...
[01:27:54.727 --> 01:27:56.347]  First, I want to thank you for keeping us on the air.
[01:27:56.367 --> 01:27:57.368]  I want to salute you.
[01:27:57.388 --> 01:28:03.149]  I want to tell you, hey, you've done an amazing job, and we've done a pretty good job as well not giving up.
[01:28:03.209 --> 01:28:07.770]  But I'm asking you right now to realize that we've come so far together.
[01:28:08.230 --> 01:28:10.171]  We don't want the globalists to win.
[01:28:10.751 --> 01:28:13.731]  So listen, I've got great products you need.
[01:28:14.612 --> 01:28:15.872]  Air filtration for your house.

[01:28:20.633 --> 01:28:21.193]  Best deal.
[01:28:21.513 --> 01:28:22.474]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:28:22.874 --> 01:28:23.894]  The water filtration.
[01:28:24.867 --> 01:28:25.567]  Alexa Pure.
[01:28:26.087 --> 01:28:26.868]  Highest rated.

[01:28:38.991 --> 01:28:40.131]  I want to stay in this fight.
[01:28:40.611 --> 01:28:41.551]  That's all I care about.
[01:28:41.591 --> 01:28:42.592]  I've been fighting so long.
[01:28:42.612 --> 01:28:44.112]  27 years on air.
[01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:45.392]  You've kept me in the fight.
[01:28:45.412 --> 01:28:51.274]  We're in this together, but I'm telling you right now, as we close out 2020 and enter into this future,
[01:28:52.014 --> 01:28:55.878]  The globalists did not count on us being on air at this time.
[01:28:56.538 --> 01:28:59.561]  So the revolutionary act of you going to InfoWarsTore.com
[01:29:00.759 --> 01:29:03.000]  Can you imagine the world without InfoWars?
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:08.342]  Can you imagine if we hadn't been on the air in the last 27 years?
[01:29:08.382 --> 01:29:11.923]  Can you imagine what would have happened to you and countless others?
[01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:34.319]  Had it supported us, we would not be in a position right now to even be able to contend with the Globalists.
[01:29:34.339 --> 01:29:35.802]  We would have already been defeated.
[01:29:35.842 --> 01:29:36.903]  So, I'm going to tell you again.
[01:29:38.396 --> 01:29:39.897]  Now is the time for your word of mouth.
[01:29:40.197 --> 01:29:41.278]  Now is the time for your prayer.
[01:29:41.478 --> 01:29:43.800]  Now is your time to financially support InfoWars.

[01:30:10.559 --> 01:30:14.422]  But regardless, I'm doing this in front of God, so what matters is I carry out the task.
