[00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:11.227]  I rarely get goosebumps.
[00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:20.655]  I rarely get chills up and down my spine, but I tell you I'm getting them every few minutes now because the world is at such an incredible crossroads right now.
[00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:25.479]  We have two very special guests coming up on the transmission today.
[00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:35.007]  I'll tell you about a little bit later, but I also want to open the phones up for listeners to give their comments on just the state of the world,
[00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:55.537]  The huge adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines, the deaths around the world, and all the other facts surrounding this that show how at every level, it is the greatest fraud, the greatest scam, the greatest hoax that this planet has ever seen.
[00:00:56.317 --> 00:01:00.018]  And you know what Hitler said, you're gonna tell a lie, you're gonna tell it so big,
[00:01:01.772 --> 00:01:02.532]  And you could say that
[00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:34.664]  That was a uniquely German stubbornness.
[00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:35.785]  Germans are known for that.
[00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.827]  But I think it's something that's in all peoples.
[00:01:38.887 --> 00:01:45.552]  In fact, the Germans have had some of the most oppressive COVID-19 global government lockdowns, but they've also had some of the stiffest resistance.
[00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:56.379]  There's a new video out of a member of a state parliament in Germany, who's a medical doctor, who says, I've called around to hospitals and they have no COVID patients.
[00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:01.503]  But I showed you yesterday from the CDC's own numbers that Austin
[00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:14.099]  Has 9% of its beds allotted for COVID, filled with COVID, but the mayor just announced nighttime curfews because the hospitals are full.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.761]  But I can go to the CDC's own site and show you how many COVID patients they've got at one time.
[00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:30.684]  I said 77, excuse me, when I actually went to the number, it was 75, the number had changed, who are actually in intensive care with COVID right now.
[00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:35.937]  And the studies are there that you should not intubate someone that has COVID.
[00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:37.738]  It's an autoimmune response normally.
[00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:39.519]  They need steroids.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.620]  But they're not getting that.
[00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.962]  And that leads us to this next nightmare report that illustrates everything.
[00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:55.026]  Congressman Luke Letlow, Congressman-elect, tested positive for COVID.
[00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:56.947]  96% of the tests were false.
[00:02:57.047 --> 00:02:58.608]  Said, well, we need to put you in the emergency room.
[00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:06.397]  And then they were doing a procedure intubating him while he was awake, shoving tubes into his lungs.
[00:03:07.037 --> 00:03:08.998]  And they said the procedure killed him.
[00:03:09.018 --> 00:03:17.022]  It actually says he died of a heart attack while having them shove tubes into his lungs.
[00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:21.985]  Guess he didn't like it too much when they turned on the pressure.
[00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:23.826]  They say it's excruciating torture.
[00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.843]  You're having an autoimmune response, and they pump your lungs up full of air.
[00:03:28.603 --> 00:03:30.424]  We've known day one, 11 months, don't do it.
[00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:33.726]  But they did it, and he's dead.
[00:03:34.687 --> 00:03:36.688]  Deader than a box of hammers.
[00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.014]  But when you see the headlines, oh, he died of COVID, and the left celebrated it.
[00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:47.915]  Oh, he's a Republican.
[00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:49.196]  Oh, he deserves it.
[00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:49.696]  Oh.
[00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:52.518]  But you see, we already have the CDC's own numbers.
[00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:54.997]  Year to date, the year's almost over.
[00:03:55.857 --> 00:04:00.279]  Right at about the same amount of deaths we had in 2019, we've had in 2020.
[00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:07.941]  The facts don't lie, but oh, what happened to Epstein's jailmate that got moved the day before he was killed?
[00:04:10.062 --> 00:04:12.183]  He got his neck broken, reportedly, like Epstein.
[00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:14.364]  But they said he died of COVID.
[00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:17.979]  You know, Kennedy died of COVID.
[00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.820]  Yeah, he didn't get his head blown off or anything.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.941]  So that's all coming up.
[00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:22.881]  Died of car wreck?
[00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:23.321]  COVID.
[00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:24.862]  Died of motorcycle accident?
[00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:25.322]  COVID.
[00:04:25.542 --> 00:04:28.884]  When I grow up, I want to see Bill Gates put in prison.
[00:04:29.064 --> 00:04:33.206]  We now take you live to the front lines of the fight for the human future.
[00:04:33.746 --> 00:04:35.227]  It is December 30th.
[00:04:35.487 --> 00:04:42.290]  The year is 2020, and we are 21 days out from the inauguration of the Chinese Communist agent.
[00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:44.472]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:44.732 --> 00:04:45.012]  Woo!
[00:04:47.728 --> 00:04:52.051]  You know, as negative as things seem, I gotta get my Ric Flair on and say, WOO!
[00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:59.815]  Because, if you look back 20 years ago, 10 years ago, a year ago, the world is white-hot awake to the New World Order right now.
[00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:04.678]  And they've been forced to try to steal this election in front of God and the whole world.
[00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:15.525]  And just everything they do is turning to pure crap as they try to wreck the economy, as they put us under siege, as everything they do gets exposed, they're a bunch of criminals.
[00:05:16.997 --> 00:05:20.839]  And so humanity's not going down without an explosive fight.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.683]  And humanity is fighting back, and the New World Order is in a absolute panic.
[00:05:28.843 --> 00:05:36.848]  Okay, we've got that New York nurse that first came on and showed how they are intubating people that are totally healthy and do not have COVID-19 and killing them.
[00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:42.010]  She's gonna pop back in today, big whistleblower, because this is in the news.
[00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:44.252]  Congressman-elect Luke Letlob
[00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.806]  Suffered a heart attack following operation.
[00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:52.687]  They were doing, they were intubating him and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:55.807]  And they say he died of a heart attack, not of COVID.
[00:05:57.608 --> 00:06:02.249]  Well, that's exactly what this nurse and many medical doctors have said is going on.
[00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:04.149]  But when you read the rest of the news, that's the New York Post.
[00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:13.631]  Fox reporter backpedals at his mocking of Republican representative-elect from COVID after Twitter beatdown.
[00:06:15.247 --> 00:06:16.627]  But he didn't die of COVID.
[00:06:16.647 --> 00:06:24.209]  They say he died of a heart attack from the procedures they were doing to his lungs, lungs, lungs, lungs, lungs.
[00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:30.130]  Simply amazing.
[00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.091]  We're gonna be going through all of the latest COVID information today.
[00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:42.012]  Also, we have Joe Hoft, the analyst,
[00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:49.524]  Corporate Fraud Auditor with a lot of big new developments on the election fraud front popping in.
[00:06:51.746 --> 00:07:02.195]  And we also have a very interesting analyst and former world champion, Bare Knuckles boxer, Andrew Tate of CobraTate.com joining us.
[00:07:02.695 --> 00:07:03.997]  He lives in Eastern Europe.
[00:07:04.872 --> 00:07:12.676]  I can give you a breakdown on the Islamic ongoing invasion, the UN lockdowns, how Eastern European countries are resisting in some cases, submitting in others.
[00:07:13.156 --> 00:07:16.198]  That should be a very informative talk as well.
[00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:28.471]  Trump said three days ago, I'm going to sign the bill because they've promised to go back and vote on $2,000 per person, $4,000 per family.
[00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:32.454]  And the left attacked him for that and said it was evil and wrong.
[00:07:33.074 --> 00:07:37.877]  They wanted to give 90 plus percent of the emergency package to foreign banks and dictatorships.
[00:07:38.477 --> 00:07:42.040]  And Trump said, no, we should give the majority of the money if we're going to do this out of the Treasury.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.501]  It's their tax money anyways to them.
[00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:46.122]  I think it's a very dangerous game to begin with.
[00:07:46.202 --> 00:07:53.387]  You keep doing these stimuluses and it's the road to inflation, it's the road to dependency, but it is a lesser of two evils if there ever was one.
[00:07:53.407 --> 00:08:04.475]  Instead of giving all the money to foreign countries and dictators and corrupt institutions and gender studies in Africa, teaching African men how to be women, literally,
[00:08:06.212 --> 00:08:08.713]  Shouldn't it just be direct payments to kickstart the economy?
[00:08:08.733 --> 00:08:14.397]  Because the whole point of the Globalist is to shut down the economy, to bankrupt Main Street, to bankrupt the middle class.
[00:08:14.497 --> 00:08:15.137]  That's on record.
[00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:16.038]  That's the Great Reset.
[00:08:16.398 --> 00:08:17.178]  That's the New World Order.
[00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:20.940]  So Trump is trying to directly fight that.
[00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:24.002]  But I mean, what, the last stimulus money was six months ago?
[00:08:25.863 --> 00:08:26.704]  Well, it was $2,000.
[00:08:28.184 --> 00:08:29.765]  Now it's $2,000 again?
[00:08:30.906 --> 00:08:32.627]  Even if Mitch McConnell can get the bill through?
[00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:35.072]  It is a lesser of two evils.
[00:08:35.112 --> 00:08:43.540]  It would be much better to end the lockdowns, to end the shutdown, and get the talking point out that Communist China is bragging.
[00:08:44.687 --> 00:08:50.030]  We've played the clip, so has Tucker Carlson, on national TV that, haha, the Americans will not even exist soon.
[00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.570]  America will be dead.
[00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.451]  These are quotes.
[00:08:53.111 --> 00:08:54.752]  We control their higher circles.
[00:08:54.832 --> 00:08:56.553]  They will never reopen again.
[00:08:57.173 --> 00:08:58.414]  We did right with COVID.
[00:08:58.454 --> 00:08:58.934]  They didn't.
[00:08:59.174 --> 00:09:01.835]  Of course, they just did a fake lockdown and were never really closed.
[00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:04.897]  And now, because they did bad, they have all the cases.
[00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:06.978]  They've stopped the PCR test.
[00:09:10.407 --> 00:09:17.573]  Here, if three people take the test, sometimes they make businesses, make people, some of them, take it three times a day.
[00:09:17.593 --> 00:09:18.794]  I mean, three times a week.
[00:09:20.715 --> 00:09:25.459]  We had a DC cop and we had some Maryland cops as security last time we were in DC.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.763]  And I went out to dinner with a few of them because I wanted to pick their brains.
[00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:33.206]  And they said, listen, we do auxiliary work for the Secret Service.
[00:09:34.312 --> 00:09:43.260]  And when we work for the Feds, every time we go in for a shift, they do a PCR test in a little automatic machine like Joe Rogan had me do for his show.
[00:09:46.203 --> 00:09:55.451]  And when somebody does test positive, they keep testing them and they count it as a COVID each time, even though they admit, no, you really don't have COVID.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.642]  But that's put into a database of all these COVID numbers, and now they just count everyone that dies of something else as COVID.
[00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:04.622]  And we all know that.
[00:10:06.163 --> 00:10:15.266]  But at the minute I saw that this congressman had, quote, died of COVID, I said, I bet when I read deeper, there'll be a footnote that he died of something else.
[00:10:16.286 --> 00:10:19.607]  And sure, as the sun came up, he died of a heart attack.
[00:10:21.348 --> 00:10:25.369]  It's like, the head Palestinian negotiator died of COVID.
[00:10:26.547 --> 00:10:34.134]  And it said two years ago, he got a risky double lung transplant because of lung cancer.
[00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:37.558]  He also had liver cancer and had been in a coma.
[00:10:39.319 --> 00:10:41.882]  He died in Israel of COVID.
[00:10:47.605 --> 00:11:00.989]  But as soon as I saw CNN, you know, oh, the head Palestinian died, and then I read, not even CNN, I had to read other places, oh, that he had had a double lung transplant years ago and had been in a coma and had cancer?
[00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.371]  So basically, if you get hit by a car, if you get eaten by a shark,
[00:11:09.434 --> 00:11:13.736]  If you die of cancer, if you die of pneumonia, if you die of the flu, you are COVID.
[00:11:14.036 --> 00:11:16.497]  And every winter, they'll say, oh, COVID is up.
[00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.118]  We've got a lockdown again.
[00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:19.599]  And notice, all the lockdowns don't work.
[00:11:19.819 --> 00:11:20.499]  It only gets worse.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.982]  Because what does Cuomo and what does Newsom and what does all of them say?
[00:11:26.142 --> 00:11:28.143]  Testing, testing, testing, testing.
[00:11:28.523 --> 00:11:30.504]  Ventilators, ventilators, ventilators, ventilators.
[00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.686]  Get a bunch of people that aren't sick, put them on ventilators, kill them.
[00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:34.666]  Get your $53,000.
[00:11:34.706 --> 00:11:35.066]  Hype up the fear.
[00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:40.874]  It's simply incredible.
[00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:45.576]  So I want to ask you, what do you think Trump should do with 21 days out?
[00:11:47.077 --> 00:11:52.579]  Do you think he's going to be at the big, giant march on Wednesday?
[00:11:52.599 --> 00:11:55.159]  Gee, I don't know.
[00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:58.341]  I don't even know what time he's speaking on Wednesday.
[00:11:58.941 --> 00:12:00.581]  But I'm going to let the president announce that.
[00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:03.662]  And the word is, he should be making an announcement this afternoon.
[00:12:05.463 --> 00:12:07.244]  But he said, please come to D.C.
[00:12:07.284 --> 00:12:08.064]  It's going to be wild.
[00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:25.480]  And we need millions and millions of people there when the Congress is set to have senatorial debate on not accepting these electors from Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, where now
[00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.791]  People just become kind of numb to it.
[00:12:29.251 --> 00:12:30.472]  The evidence of fraud.
[00:12:30.532 --> 00:12:32.193]  They had total evidence a month ago.
[00:12:32.593 --> 00:12:34.514]  Complete over-the-top evidence two weeks ago.
[00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:38.976]  And now, it's just videos of people stuffing ballot boxes.
[00:12:39.296 --> 00:12:41.617]  Videos of people running the same stack of ballots over and over again.
[00:12:41.877 --> 00:12:46.199]  Videos of them kicking everybody out and covering up the windows and then engaging in the fraud.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.380]  Michigan, you name it.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.081]  Pennsylvania, Georgia.
[00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:56.470]  Democrat judges trying to block signature checks when they're found.
[00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.471]  They're getting ready to steal Georgia with both the Senate seats.
[00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:04.191]  I mean, this is absolutely out of control and crazy.
[00:13:05.272 --> 00:13:08.892]  I think Trump should be at the Resolute Desk every night exposing this and fighting this.
[00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:13.473]  I guess he wants to build up the crescendo so when he does speak, people really listen.
[00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:14.594]  I don't think that's the strategy.
[00:13:14.634 --> 00:13:16.034]  We're running out of time.
[00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:18.682]  What do you think you should do?
[00:13:18.962 --> 00:13:30.209]  And what are you going to do when they try to intimidate you to take these deadly vaccines, which they now admit, Pfizer, Moderna, they all came out and said quietly, by the way, this won't even protect you from COVID.
[00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:36.433]  It won't protect you from mutations and you'll have to get five of them a year and you'll still be able to spread it.
[00:13:37.374 --> 00:13:40.176]  Now the head of the WHO, the head vaccine program, she said that yesterday.
[00:13:41.044 --> 00:13:46.147]  And now nurses that took the shot two weeks ago are going, they say I've got COVID now!
[00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:49.769]  Of course the vaccine made you test positive, Dumbo!
[00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.991]  Why do you think they're testing positive for HIV?
[00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:56.313]  I mean, this is such an evil rollout.
[00:13:57.434 --> 00:14:03.497]  We'll open the phones up, we'll get the number out when we come back, and I'll explain the methodology behind what's happening, why this is so obvious.
[00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:05.979]  I can tell you, my friends, this
[00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:09.483]  January 6th in D.C.
[00:14:10.303 --> 00:14:11.744]  has got the establishment scared.
[00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:16.808]  They've had the CIA and the FBI following me around for over a month.
[00:14:17.429 --> 00:14:18.650]  They've been following other people around.
[00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.511]  They've had people reach out to us.
[00:14:20.811 --> 00:14:24.534]  They've come and visited us and just said, please be careful in D.C.
[00:14:24.934 --> 00:14:26.035]  Please be careful at these rallies.
[00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.677]  Please don't incite anyone.
[00:14:28.537 --> 00:14:29.738]  Please, it's so dangerous.
[00:14:29.778 --> 00:14:31.019]  We're so concerned.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.241]  They had a big ABC Nightly News.
[00:14:35.106 --> 00:14:40.690]  Anchor, I'll leave it at that, say one of their big people, call me up and say, we're so scared, you're not planning anything.
[00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.812]  And I always say to them, you know, that's funny.
[00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:50.678]  Antifa is the one that burned down all those police stations and public housing and shot people in the head and ran checkpoints and did all that terrible stuff.
[00:14:51.779 --> 00:15:00.565]  And BLM, they got $10.6 billion and it's been the left calling for all this violence and the overthrow of the government and no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:15:00.605 --> 00:15:03.608]  It's the UN building refugee centers, then hammering our borders.
[00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:11.013]  It's Hollywood saying they wanted to bankrupt the economy and basically use COVID to drive Trump for power.
[00:15:12.714 --> 00:15:18.598]  And so past activity is always the best indicator of future activity.
[00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:23.181]  And so no, we're not planning to come to DC to overrun the Capitol.
[00:15:24.684 --> 00:15:26.204]  We're not planning to go to D.C.
[00:15:26.264 --> 00:15:28.965]  to shoot anybody or bomb anything.
[00:15:29.005 --> 00:15:29.885]  That's the last thing we want.
[00:15:30.085 --> 00:15:35.026]  We're there to show the numbers that Joe Biden can't get 1,000 people out or 100 people out.
[00:15:35.266 --> 00:15:40.327]  And everywhere Trump goes, he can get 20,000, 50,000, 100,000 or 5 million.
[00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:42.688]  We're voting with our feet.
[00:15:42.728 --> 00:15:46.128]  The Democrats are closing a bunch of the hotels and saying, oh, you're not allowed in the city.
[00:15:46.368 --> 00:15:46.809]  You know what?
[00:15:46.869 --> 00:15:47.969]  But the illegal aliens are.
[00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:49.649]  We're just not allowed.
[00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:53.750]  I got footage out of San Antonio where our listeners went to the mall.
[00:15:55.506 --> 00:15:58.328]  Didn't wear their mask and got assaulted by police.
[00:15:58.888 --> 00:16:02.771]  But if they were BLM burning the place down, the police would salute them.
[00:16:04.932 --> 00:16:09.155]  Because this is a disgusting political takeover.
[00:16:12.577 --> 00:16:13.377]  That's what this is.
[00:16:13.437 --> 00:16:15.919]  And so, I say this.
[00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:16.399]  We're going to DC.
[00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:18.080]  There's going to be millions of people there.
[00:16:18.601 --> 00:16:21.202]  And anti-fund BLM aren't going to show their little rat faces.
[00:16:23.064 --> 00:16:24.925]  If you are with children,
[00:16:26.428 --> 00:16:30.131]  You don't want to go out unaccompanied at parking garages or at night.
[00:16:32.073 --> 00:16:34.475]  Because there aren't really children or people in D.C.
[00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:34.695]  now.
[00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:36.857]  It's been locked down for months and months and months.
[00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:40.640]  And so, yes, they will attack women and children, but it's only a few cases of it.
[00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:42.882]  And that is if you get off the beaten path.
[00:16:43.843 --> 00:16:51.750]  And if you're wearing a Make America Great Again hat or any type of American flag, that is like a red banner to a bull.
[00:16:53.083 --> 00:17:05.592]  But we will outnumber them a thousand to one, and the police are under globalist control in D.C., but they are not about to try to start anything with millions of American people.
[00:17:05.652 --> 00:17:08.594]  So all of you should come to D.C.
[00:17:08.954 --> 00:17:09.895]  for this historic event.
[00:17:09.935 --> 00:17:16.800]  This is the same level as July 4, 1776, as we declare independence against the globalists and their operatives.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.442]  And believe me, you're going to want to be there on the 5th and the 6th.
[00:17:22.352 --> 00:17:25.674]  And depending on what happens, a lot of people are going to end up just staying in D.C.
[00:17:26.334 --> 00:17:30.236]  and occupying it because Joe Biden is not our president.
[00:17:31.437 --> 00:17:32.277]  Be part of history.
[00:17:32.517 --> 00:17:33.237]  Fight for Trump.
[00:17:33.297 --> 00:17:33.998]  Fight for yourself.
[00:17:34.038 --> 00:17:34.798]  Fight for America.
[00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:36.539]  Fight for voting integrity.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.782]  Fight with the First Amendment and with nonviolent action.
[00:17:43.683 --> 00:17:47.805]  Now, let's go to the puppet in chief, the so-called president-elect,
[00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:51.719]  Joe Biden again says the quiet part aloud.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.282]  President-elect Kamala Harris.
[00:17:54.302 --> 00:17:54.722]  Here it is.
[00:17:57.164 --> 00:17:59.706]  I took it to instill public confidence in the vaccine.
[00:18:00.427 --> 00:18:04.130]  President-elect Harris took hers today for the same reason.
[00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:11.075]  And when the president's doctors recommend it, President Trump should take it and instill the same degree of confidence.
[00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:22.095]  Here is Joe Biden yesterday saying he's not getting his military briefings as a communist Chinese agent.
[00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:30.261]  With his son going, I work for the head communist Chinese, me and my dad are under criminal investigation, we get billions from them, I'm scared!
[00:18:31.182 --> 00:18:32.803]  But Bill Barr says no problem.
[00:18:33.784 --> 00:18:38.127]  And now Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate was found with his neck broken in his apartment.
[00:18:38.167 --> 00:18:43.051]  He died of COVID, just like this congressman they killed with innovation with a heart attack.
[00:18:44.071 --> 00:18:44.592]  Died of COVID.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.162]  Next they're gonna say Jesus died of COVID, not of being crucified and bayoneted in the side.
[00:18:53.402 --> 00:19:01.505]  Let's go ahead and go to Joe Biden, whining that as a Chinese Communist agent, he hasn't been given the keys to the nukes yet to give the CHICOMs.
[00:19:01.525 --> 00:19:01.865]  Here it is.
[00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:11.688]  And right now, as our nation is in a period of transition, we need to make sure that nothing is lost in the handoff between administrations.
[00:19:13.103 --> 00:19:19.650]  My team needs a clear picture of our force posture around the world and our operations to deter our enemies.
[00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:32.542]  We need full visibility into the budget planning underway at the Defense Department and other agencies in order to avoid any window of confusion or catch-up that our adversaries may try to exploit.
[00:19:32.843 --> 00:19:33.563]  Our adversaries?
[00:19:33.784 --> 00:19:34.865]  As I said from the beginning,
[00:19:35.913 --> 00:19:42.819]  We have encountered roadblocks from the political leadership at the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:53.589]  Right now, we just aren't getting all the information that we need from the ongoing administration in key national security areas.
[00:19:54.565 --> 00:19:57.487]  It's nothing short in my view of irresponsibility.
[00:19:57.967 --> 00:19:59.068]  Irresponsibility.
[00:19:59.108 --> 00:20:07.872]  You're the ones that had a shadow government and shadow diplomacy with you and John Kerry and Obama following Trump around the world telling world leaders don't listen to him.
[00:20:08.193 --> 00:20:09.173]  He'll be gone soon.
[00:20:09.213 --> 00:20:10.374]  Your previous coup attempts.
[00:20:11.434 --> 00:20:14.956]  You're the ones that tried to keep him from even getting an office.
[00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:17.678]  You're the ones that had the bureaucracy not do what the president said.
[00:20:19.986 --> 00:20:20.447]  Unbelievable.
[00:20:21.147 --> 00:20:22.148]  Let's go to this next clip.
[00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:28.114]  This is Australian Senator Jim Malone, former Major General on Communist China.
[00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:33.639]  Cutting edge night vision helmets soon to be distributed to more than 5,000 ADF personnel.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.523]  It's part of the Morrison Government's record $270 billion investment in defence capability over the next decade.
[00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:47.765]  The ADF has never been better than it is now.
[00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:50.486]  And according to some, there's a reason for that.
[00:20:50.786 --> 00:21:00.031]  We are likely in the next three to five years, or in the next five to ten years, to be involved in a war between China and the United States.
[00:21:00.151 --> 00:21:08.134]  Former Major General and Liberal Senator Jim Molan says Australia must develop a national security strategy to prepare for war.
[00:21:08.554 --> 00:21:12.496]  A war is more likely now than it's been probably for 75 years.
[00:21:12.796 --> 00:21:14.476]  And security experts agree.
[00:21:14.777 --> 00:21:18.258]  It's certainly a much higher risk than we've seen for a long, long time.
[00:21:18.638 --> 00:21:24.820]  There are also concerns that the United States, our most powerful ally, is not at its greatest military capacity.
[00:21:25.721 --> 00:21:29.942]  In 1991, the US Navy was 600 warships strong.
[00:21:30.062 --> 00:21:31.343]  Now, it's less than 300.
[00:21:31.463 --> 00:21:34.304]  There's limits even to what the Americans can actually do.
[00:21:34.824 --> 00:21:39.867]  Labor says speculating about war is only making a bad situation with China worse.
[00:21:40.207 --> 00:21:44.109]  What we need now is a calm and strategic approach from Scott Morrison.
[00:21:44.449 --> 00:21:47.911]  Others within the coalition believe that we shouldn't be arguing with China.
[00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:53.134]  Rather, we should send officials to Beijing to try and repair the damaged relationship.
[00:21:53.674 --> 00:22:01.899]  Former Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce told 7Sunrise that Scott Morrison should not have demanded an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.
[00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:05.701]  You don't walk into the pub and pick a fight with the biggest person and think that you're not going to get punched back.
[00:22:06.141 --> 00:22:10.543]  One thing everyone agrees on, the current environment is extremely volatile.
[00:22:11.003 --> 00:22:12.804]  Jennifer Beshawati, 7 News.
[00:22:13.224 --> 00:22:14.544]  Did you hear that capitulation?
[00:22:14.604 --> 00:22:15.985]  China's basically taken over.
[00:22:17.907 --> 00:22:27.876]  Australia, they've taken control of all the rare earth minerals, they've bought off most of the city leaders, they implemented the lockdowns there, and so the Australian central government's trying to struggle away right now, that's what's happening.
[00:22:28.216 --> 00:22:34.462]  You heard the appeasement of some of the Democrat Labour leaders, like, you don't mess with the big guy, you do what they say.
[00:22:35.123 --> 00:22:40.107]  These are the Neville Chamberlains of our age, and now they're putting in their agent, Joe Biden, into the White House.
[00:22:40.507 --> 00:22:42.069]  That will only make them more aggressive.
[00:22:42.349 --> 00:22:42.869]  God help us.
[00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:48.673]  I cannot stress to you how incredibly important this time is we're all alive in.
[00:22:48.693 --> 00:22:55.198]  How important opening up a channel to God and asking God for guidance and discernment in the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:55.998 --> 00:22:58.360]  That is beyond critical, it is essential.
[00:23:01.772 --> 00:23:03.914]  I want to open the phones up in this segment and the next.
[00:23:04.434 --> 00:23:08.058]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:23:08.378 --> 00:23:12.662]  First time callers, long time callers, callers that disagree, callers that agree, I don't care.
[00:23:12.702 --> 00:23:13.602]  I want to move you quick.
[00:23:14.123 --> 00:23:17.025]  What's your take on what Trump needs to do with 21 days out?
[00:23:17.206 --> 00:23:17.966]  He's not giving up.
[00:23:18.246 --> 00:23:19.287]  More evidence is coming out.
[00:23:19.668 --> 00:23:20.468]  What's going to happen on the 6th?
[00:23:21.229 --> 00:23:22.629]  What do you make of all the COVID news?
[00:23:22.649 --> 00:23:23.990]  People dying from the vaccine.
[00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.230]  People convulsing.
[00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.810]  People getting paralyzed.
[00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.911]  People going into comas.
[00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:29.691]  The media trying to cover it up.
[00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:31.912]  It is just an insane time.
[00:23:31.932 --> 00:23:34.532]  What do you make of China threatening to attack the U.S.
[00:23:34.572 --> 00:23:35.893]  and threatening to attack Australia?
[00:23:36.273 --> 00:23:36.873]  Toll free number 877-789-2539.
[00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:38.013]  What would you call this time we're in?
[00:23:38.113 --> 00:23:39.434]  That's the big question.
[00:23:39.454 --> 00:23:39.674]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:23:49.838 --> 00:23:50.799]  Let me tell you who's coming up.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.823]  Joe Hoff, the expert from Gateway Pond on the latest on election fraud.
[00:23:56.205 --> 00:24:03.012]  Nurse Erin Olszewski, that big whistleblower where they were killing people on purpose up in New York at the so-called epicenter of epicenters.
[00:24:03.032 --> 00:24:07.137]  That ties into this congressman-elect that they just killed intubating, it looks like.
[00:24:07.717 --> 00:24:09.820]  Many died of a heart attack during, quote, intubation.
[00:24:11.289 --> 00:24:16.431]  Andrew Tate, living in Eastern Europe, world champion, bare-knuckles jiu-jitsu fighter.
[00:24:16.451 --> 00:24:19.952]  He's going to be joining us, giving his take on what's happening in the world.
[00:24:20.032 --> 00:24:23.193]  And John Rappaport, no more fake news, great investigative journalist.
[00:24:24.434 --> 00:24:29.496]  I'm going to go to Sarah and Chris and Josh and everybody here in just a moment.
[00:24:31.216 --> 00:24:33.337]  But I do want to remind you and I want to thank you
[00:24:35.467 --> 00:24:36.448]  For your support.
[00:24:36.688 --> 00:24:40.010]  You have taken InfoWars so far and you are InfoWars.
[00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.431]  That's not rhetoric, that's the truth.
[00:24:42.792 --> 00:24:46.355]  So thank you, all of you, for your support.
[00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:47.676]  Thank you for buying t-shirts.
[00:24:47.716 --> 00:24:56.502]  Thanks for buying books and films and shortwave radios and storable food and non-GMO heirloom seeds and all the great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:24:56.902 --> 00:25:01.025]  Thank you for keeping us on the air in a symbiotic relationship.
[00:25:02.284 --> 00:25:05.428]  Back in stock, sold out for eight months because the supply chain broke down.
[00:25:06.369 --> 00:25:09.854]  Pollen block to counter seasonal discomfort, allergies.
[00:25:09.994 --> 00:25:11.296]  It is back in stock.
[00:25:11.336 --> 00:25:13.358]  It's a natural formula, not a chemical.
[00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:16.242]  It comes from specially fed quail eggs in France.
[00:25:16.282 --> 00:25:17.063]  It's proprietary.
[00:25:17.484 --> 00:25:18.305]  There are studies on it.
[00:25:18.605 --> 00:25:19.166]  It's amazing.
[00:25:19.246 --> 00:25:19.967]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:24.010]  Prostagard is great for men, but also women.
[00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.831]  Yeah, study shows it's great for your prostate, good for all your glands.
[00:25:27.271 --> 00:25:31.892]  It's got the vitamin D3, the selenium, the zinc, all that great stuff that's for your immune system.
[00:25:32.312 --> 00:25:33.593]  It's back in stock, discounted.
[00:25:34.393 --> 00:25:36.334]  We also have X2, sold out for months.
[00:25:36.474 --> 00:25:40.015]  Our original deep earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[00:25:40.055 --> 00:25:41.695]  Nobody else has got iodine like this.
[00:25:42.616 --> 00:25:50.018]  X3 is triiodine with two other types, because some people can't absorb, it's a very low percentage, a couple points, cannot absorb pure iodine.
[00:25:51.138 --> 00:25:53.600]  So it's got the Deep Earth Crystal and two other types that are also good.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.282]  That's X3.
[00:25:55.342 --> 00:25:59.386]  But X2 is the original Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[00:25:59.446 --> 00:26:00.747]  It's been sold out of Central.
[00:26:01.308 --> 00:26:05.752]  The UN admits over 2 million people have cognitive deficiencies from lack of iodine.
[00:26:06.983 --> 00:26:08.764]  It's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[00:26:09.344 --> 00:26:11.965]  X2, back in stock, 50% off.
[00:26:12.585 --> 00:26:16.186]  Cold-pressed, super male vitality, also great for women, sold out for months.
[00:26:16.786 --> 00:26:18.907]  Back in stock, 50% off as well.
[00:26:19.227 --> 00:26:22.288]  And your purchases make everything possible, so I want to thank you also.
[00:26:25.714 --> 00:26:29.916]  Thank you for supporting our local AM and FM affiliates and local TV affiliates.
[00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:33.697]  Please tell them that you appreciate them picking us up.
[00:26:33.757 --> 00:26:34.918]  Please support their sponsors.
[00:26:35.418 --> 00:26:39.720]  Please become a sponsor, but whatever you do, spread the word about those local fine stations.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.161]  That's just as critical as supporting us.
[00:26:42.761 --> 00:26:46.422]  Okay, let's go to Josh in Texas first.
[00:26:46.743 --> 00:26:48.403]  You're on the air on COVID-19.
[00:26:50.064 --> 00:26:51.545]  Alex, good afternoon, sir.
[00:26:51.665 --> 00:26:52.345]  Thank you for
[00:26:53.087 --> 00:26:55.748]  Everything that you guys, InfoWars, has done.
[00:26:55.768 --> 00:27:05.291]  Because the only way to truly understand what's going on in this time is to really look from a 50,000 foot view, which you have done for us.
[00:27:08.732 --> 00:27:09.732]  Well, give me your view on that.
[00:27:09.892 --> 00:27:11.212]  What is that 50,000 foot view?
[00:27:12.853 --> 00:27:17.274]  Unfortunately, as you've shown us, they are coming at us from multiple angles.
[00:27:18.274 --> 00:27:20.375]  Medical, pedophilia,
[00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:24.600]  They are attacking us this year from multiple angles.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.120]  It is so sick.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.500]  It is so genius.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.081]  And it is so devious.
[00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:31.121]  And I cannot believe it is working.
[00:27:31.741 --> 00:27:33.462]  I'm an angry, happy American.
[00:27:34.102 --> 00:27:35.102]  I'm a 31-year-old.
[00:27:35.142 --> 00:27:39.703]  I got three young kids fighting this battle against the left every day.
[00:27:40.203 --> 00:27:42.683]  They're trying to force an mRNA vaccine.
[00:27:43.364 --> 00:27:43.864]  It's sick.
[00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:46.944]  This plan is so devious.
[00:27:47.444 --> 00:27:47.965]  So sick.
[00:27:48.725 --> 00:27:50.125]  Coming at us from so many angles.
[00:27:50.583 --> 00:27:54.346]  The only way to truly understand it is to be able to follow over the last couple years.
[00:27:54.806 --> 00:28:02.732]  And so it's so hard to get through to these people, trying to teach them a COVID particle is 0.01 microns in size.
[00:28:03.293 --> 00:28:03.793]  The mask!
[00:28:04.181 --> 00:28:05.041]  Does it work?
[00:28:05.522 --> 00:28:09.443]  The micron, the particle is too small, but people don't hear it.
[00:28:09.844 --> 00:28:19.848]  In fact, the studies that show it's worse, even the M95 mask, what it does is, the M95 protects you a little bit, but not people breathing out.
[00:28:20.409 --> 00:28:25.251]  Instead, it gets into the aerosolization of the saliva
[00:28:25.931 --> 00:28:31.616]  It helps concentrate it, just like nucleization with raindrops, and actually helps spread it worse.
[00:28:31.636 --> 00:28:38.922]  That's why studies show as soon as the masks go in, you get higher death rates, but not really from COVID, but from bacterial pneumonia.
[00:28:38.942 --> 00:28:39.743]  Thank you so much.
[00:28:41.504 --> 00:28:44.547]  The globalists call this a full-spectrum dominance effect.
[00:28:46.101 --> 00:29:00.385]  And what they do is they create a whole false environment where you can beat one attack, two attacks, three attacks, five attacks, ten attacks, but when the entire system is designed to lie to you, to confuse you and destroy you, people go into learned helplessness.
[00:29:01.445 --> 00:29:13.768]  But if you're fully aware of the paradigm and have a connection to God and pull back and start looking at how the operation works and you're not a victim, you see it as an obstacle course, then you become stronger.
[00:29:14.838 --> 00:29:16.299]  First, don't see yourself as a victim.
[00:29:17.019 --> 00:29:19.060]  See this as a spiritual challenge God has given us.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.921]  Know that God is in control.
[00:29:21.501 --> 00:29:22.601]  Know the finish line is there.
[00:29:23.122 --> 00:29:24.282]  We've just got to move forward.
[00:29:25.283 --> 00:29:28.444]  But yes, the enemy's throwing everything they've got at us because there was a global awakening.
[00:29:30.825 --> 00:29:33.146]  All right, let's go to Carlos in Canada.
[00:29:33.166 --> 00:29:34.086]  Carlos, thanks for holding.
[00:29:34.126 --> 00:29:34.466]  Go ahead.
[00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:36.487]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:29:36.567 --> 00:29:37.228]  Happy New Year.
[00:29:37.628 --> 00:29:37.928]  Welcome.
[00:29:39.188 --> 00:29:42.670]  Basically, the next, I guess what President Trump
[00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:50.654]  I should be looking for at this stage is to remind everyone that it wasn't just a Trump election that took place.
[00:29:50.714 --> 00:29:53.576]  It was a Trump-Pence team election.
[00:29:53.937 --> 00:30:03.043]  The Vice President in the Constitution, by law, cannot receive an election that has not been held according to the standards under law under the Constitution.
[00:30:03.712 --> 00:30:17.437]  So, I believe, with all respect to all those people that may be disappointed, that the Vice President will look at the presentation of the Electoral College results and the fact that the election was not held.
[00:30:17.457 --> 00:30:26.520]  I mean, obvious evidence is everywhere that this election was not held under the rules and cannot qualify them, regardless of what.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:33.262]  Now, the best revenge against such manipulation of the electoral process for the Democrats will be the next
[00:30:34.591 --> 00:30:41.339]  Twelve years should be Trumpicans, I guess I call them, because they're Republicans that follow Trump.
[00:30:41.419 --> 00:30:42.060]  Trumpist.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.063]  Trumpist is what Antifa calls us.
[00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:53.447]  Well, I call them Trumpicants, because the real Trump Republicans are the ones that are now offering an alternative to the Republican Party.
[00:30:53.827 --> 00:31:04.430]  The main populist movement to take America back is going through the Republican Party, because the Democrats are pure communist chi-com agents, so the only venue we've got right now is the Republicans.
[00:31:05.253 --> 00:31:11.175]  But if you have heard the last speech given by Vice President Pence to the youth military, I believe.
[00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:12.515]  I'm not sure, I think it was he.
[00:31:12.835 --> 00:31:14.696]  I heard it and he was amazing.
[00:31:15.136 --> 00:31:19.457]  This is a man that is committed to the Vice Presidency of the United States under the Constitution.
[00:31:19.737 --> 00:31:22.698]  He's not defending Pence, he's defending the Vice Presidency.
[00:31:23.518 --> 00:31:27.019]  So why do you think he didn't no-bill the electors on the 23rd?
[00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:30.260]  You think he'll do the right thing on the 6th of January?
[00:31:31.788 --> 00:31:36.291]  Because it was precisely at that point a personal opinion, okay?
[00:31:36.331 --> 00:31:42.595]  The fact is that he must now open the debate, and when he does, he cannot under law, given the presentation of the facts.
[00:31:43.556 --> 00:31:45.857]  It's not personal opinion on the Vice President's part.
[00:31:46.178 --> 00:31:57.906]  It has to be measured by data and evidence, and the debate on the floor will show enough evidence already in the media, and the judges have already shown that, in fact, hundreds of thousands of votes were not qualified.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.981]  All right, thank you so much, Carlos.
[00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:06.206]  We'll all be in DC while the vote and the debate's going on with millions of other Americans, and so will the President, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:06.886 --> 00:32:07.326]  That's right.
[00:32:08.087 --> 00:32:08.827]  Trump will be speaking.
[00:32:08.847 --> 00:32:09.468]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:10.969]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.529]  Stay with us.
[00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.871]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[00:32:14.952 --> 00:32:21.796]  Millions of Americans already on their way, preparing to go to DC on January 5th and 6th.
[00:32:23.427 --> 00:32:32.583]  And then whatever happens, we're going to continue to fight on because the election was a fraud and Joe Biden is a globalist operative who plans to never let the lockdown end.
[00:32:32.683 --> 00:32:35.648]  Communist China now has all their stock markets exploding.
[00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:39.540]  Their investment is the biggest ever.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.542]  Now Bloomberg is celebrating, saying, oh, they're going to surpass the U.S.
[00:32:44.602 --> 00:32:44.982]  in 2028.
[00:32:45.662 --> 00:32:49.204]  America's done because of the COVID lockdowns.
[00:32:49.364 --> 00:32:50.564]  China's open for business.
[00:32:50.704 --> 00:32:51.244]  We're not.
[00:32:51.765 --> 00:32:53.025]  This is so transparent.
[00:32:53.845 --> 00:32:54.946]  This is so over the top.
[00:32:56.806 --> 00:32:58.127]  It's so incredibly evil.
[00:33:00.205 --> 00:33:02.266]  And every facet is a fraud.
[00:33:02.306 --> 00:33:07.888]  The PCR test, all of it, and they just keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing.
[00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:13.270]  Imagine where we'll be in a couple years if we submit to President Harris.
[00:33:14.651 --> 00:33:17.872]  That's who the President is now, if you let this fraud get in.
[00:33:19.193 --> 00:33:20.813]  It's a fraud at every level.
[00:33:22.654 --> 00:33:24.235]  Okay, who's up next here?
[00:33:26.076 --> 00:33:28.176]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Rhode Island.
[00:33:28.236 --> 00:33:29.157]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:33:30.868 --> 00:33:33.230]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:41.015]  First-time caller, long-time listener, love InfoWars, love the products, love your spirit and your analysis.
[00:33:41.496 --> 00:33:43.277]  Woken a lot of people up, including me.
[00:33:43.297 --> 00:33:51.003]  I went from being essentially a half-asleep, liberal, indoctrinated,
[00:33:51.887 --> 00:34:01.394]  With ideas of doing the right thing for everybody, but not realizing how the liberal agenda actually twists us and paints us into a corner and delivers the opposite of what we think we should have.
[00:34:01.954 --> 00:34:07.958]  Two, listening to you and then dialing into other alternative media and finally figuring out what the heck was going on.
[00:34:08.458 --> 00:34:12.261]  I just want to amplify what you're saying, which is everybody has to be in D.C.
[00:34:12.301 --> 00:34:21.247]  on the 6th, and I think we should think of it as more of a long-term occupation as needed to peacefully surround and protect the White House
[00:34:21.927 --> 00:34:28.009]  To ensure that it's not overtaken by, you know, authoritarians and tyrants that want to destroy this country.
[00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.790]  One of the problems, Alex, I've lived and worked overseas.
[00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.311]  I've been in authoritarian countries.
[00:34:32.331 --> 00:34:33.331]  I see how it works.
[00:34:33.391 --> 00:34:37.332]  I see how the people are, you know, suppressed and controlled.
[00:34:37.352 --> 00:34:38.173]  It's a tragedy.
[00:34:38.953 --> 00:34:41.434]  The people are good, but they just don't have any power.
[00:34:41.754 --> 00:34:43.254]  And that's coming to the United States.
[00:34:43.395 --> 00:34:45.195]  We take for granted the freedom that we have.
[00:34:45.535 --> 00:34:49.277]  We take for granted the self-empowerment and self-determination that we have.
[00:34:49.317 --> 00:34:50.517]  It's hard for us to imagine
[00:34:50.965 --> 00:34:51.646]  Not having it.
[00:34:52.206 --> 00:34:55.909]  You know, fortunately, half the country is awake and understands what the stakes are.
[00:34:56.249 --> 00:35:02.634]  The biggest challenge we have is waking up the other half, who are being lulled into a false sense of security by the lying mainstream media.
[00:35:03.155 --> 00:35:06.838]  So, one of the things I'd like to suggest is that, A, we go down to D.C.
[00:35:06.878 --> 00:35:08.579]  on the 6th, but we plan to come back.
[00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:19.228]  We plan to maintain a continuous presence of civil disobedience to ensure that that White House is protected and the Constitution is preserved until we get a fair adjudication of what's happened.
[00:35:19.628 --> 00:35:19.989]  We're good.
[00:35:38.504 --> 00:35:46.307]  And try to come to some kind of a sense about what's going on and not be blindsided and just painted into a corner, incarcerated and made obsolete.
[00:35:46.367 --> 00:35:49.869]  Well, that's right, because this is a foreign multinational takeover.
[00:35:49.929 --> 00:35:58.772]  Not only did Biden clearly try to steal this election and get caught with his pants down, it doesn't matter how much the mainstream media gaslights or turncoat politicians say he's the president, we know the truth.
[00:35:59.133 --> 00:36:04.255]  It's that he's an open foreign agent, part of the same cartel that tried all these coups on the president.
[00:36:05.135 --> 00:36:06.735]  And now we're just supposed to roll over to them.
[00:36:06.815 --> 00:36:19.938]  They are going to fully keep us shut down because he's a Chinese agent for the globalists, because the globalists have all invested in China to ensure that we are economically bankrupted under the Great Reset, that's mission is to make us poor.
[00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:25.420]  You will own nothing, you will have nothing, and you will like it under this new corporate global fascism.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.980]  So this is the main move on America.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.761]  So it's bigger than Trump.
[00:36:30.161 --> 00:36:31.381]  It's even bigger than Joe Biden.
[00:36:32.537 --> 00:36:34.938]  We the people must recognize this is the takeover.
[00:36:34.998 --> 00:36:38.819]  We need governors, we need legislatures to recognize this is not secession.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:52.564]  We need, if they're able to kick Trump out, to have the states pull back and say, we reconstitute the republic under the Declaration of Independence, under the Constitution, under the Bill of Rights, and we do not recognize what is in D.C.
[00:36:53.025 --> 00:36:54.485]  That is the point we're here at.
[00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:56.466]  We are going under the New World Order.
[00:36:56.506 --> 00:36:57.946]  We are going under world government.
[00:36:58.187 --> 00:36:59.687]  We are going under the end of the country.
[00:36:59.727 --> 00:37:01.468]  We are going under economic siege.
[00:37:02.068 --> 00:37:06.750]  And we're going under classical Marxism directed by these trillion dollar companies.
[00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:08.791]  Thank you for the call, Mike.
[00:37:08.811 --> 00:37:10.872]  The order of the calls are received.
[00:37:11.472 --> 00:37:16.034]  And the next caller here would be Jessica in Michigan.
[00:37:16.074 --> 00:37:17.095]  Jessica, thanks for calling.
[00:37:18.715 --> 00:37:19.196]  Hi, Alex.
[00:37:19.236 --> 00:37:19.716]  How are you?
[00:37:21.256 --> 00:37:21.857]  I'll tell you this.
[00:37:21.897 --> 00:37:22.537]  I'm not bored.
[00:37:22.557 --> 00:37:23.497]  I'm on the edge of my seat.
[00:37:23.517 --> 00:37:25.238]  I mean, you could cut the suspense with a knife.
[00:37:25.278 --> 00:37:26.859]  We are living in incredible times.
[00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:32.092]  You know, if anybody's bored right now, then I have to say that, uh, you know, that's a problem.
[00:37:32.673 --> 00:37:38.496]  Um, but, uh, yeah, I, I have to thank you first of all, for awakening me and my husband about 10 years ago.
[00:37:38.636 --> 00:37:46.941]  If not, we, he probably wouldn't be alive right now because you got us into, uh, going into the natural stuff along with the political stuff.
[00:37:46.961 --> 00:37:56.586]  And if we hadn't gone that route, he would have been on a bunch of prescriptions and probably died because the doctors did nothing for him basically, other than give him a bunch of tests and say, we can't find nothing wrong with you.
[00:37:56.626 --> 00:37:56.746]  So.
[00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.432]  I appreciate everything that you do every day.
[00:37:59.492 --> 00:38:01.493]  God bless you and your products are amazing.
[00:38:27.549 --> 00:38:32.791]  I can't get a note from my doctor because her upper said that she's not allowed to write mask exceptions for people.
[00:38:33.172 --> 00:38:35.853]  So I have to wear it while I'm at work, but I don't wear it as a customer.
[00:38:36.233 --> 00:38:40.675]  So when I have people come through my line that aren't wearing a mask, I thank them for not wearing a mask.
[00:38:40.735 --> 00:38:42.176]  I start a conversation with them.
[00:38:42.196 --> 00:38:46.438]  You know, even some of the people that are wearing masks, you can tell they really don't want to be wearing it.
[00:38:46.498 --> 00:38:48.799]  And I'll sit here and I'll talk about things with people and then
[00:38:49.588 --> 00:38:55.933]  Sometimes they'll say like random things like, oh well that sounds like a Trump supporter when it's something that a Biden supporter did.
[00:38:55.953 --> 00:38:56.933]  And I'm like, wait, what?
[00:38:56.973 --> 00:39:02.157]  Like we were on the same page up until the very last moment there and it just shows like how far divided the country is.
[00:39:02.177 --> 00:39:07.621]  You have to keep fighting and explain to them that it's an economic weapon to shut down the mom and pops.
[00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:10.043]  It's tell them they need to search the Great Reset.
[00:39:10.683 --> 00:39:16.725]  Tell them they need to understand this is economic warfare and that it's about teaching us that we're bad and we're dirty.
[00:39:17.045 --> 00:39:21.887]  I'd also tell them the mask can give you bacterial pneumonia and to look up those studies.
[00:39:22.808 --> 00:39:24.308]  Oh yeah, I've been telling them all sorts of that.
[00:39:24.348 --> 00:39:34.052]  Every time they say that they love the mask or whatever they say, I say, well, you know that there's a study out that says the majority of people that caught COVID were wearing their masks while they had, you know, their avid... Absolutely.
[00:39:34.092 --> 00:39:35.372]  Jessica, thank you so much.
[00:39:35.432 --> 00:39:36.233]  Have a great new year.
[00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.093]  We're all in this together.
[00:39:37.213 --> 00:39:38.954]  Let's go to Chase in California.
[00:39:38.994 --> 00:39:39.654]  Go ahead, Chase.
[00:39:41.468 --> 00:39:42.988]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:39:43.668 --> 00:39:46.009]  I want to say also, Texas is quite a great place.
[00:39:46.209 --> 00:39:49.530]  I live in California, but I decided to take my family to Texas.
[00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:53.791]  Went to the Texas University football game last night, so God bless Texas.
[00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:54.931]  God bless you, brother.
[00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:56.051]  We're trying to keep it Texas.
[00:39:57.131 --> 00:39:57.691]  I'll tell you what.
[00:39:57.751 --> 00:40:00.012]  Hey, I want to talk about the ammo shortage, though.
[00:40:00.032 --> 00:40:01.272]  I don't know if you've been following this.
[00:40:01.472 --> 00:40:02.932]  It's a big deal, yeah.
[00:40:02.952 --> 00:40:03.593]  Tell folks about it.
[00:40:04.533 --> 00:40:07.953]  Yeah, for months now, you cannot buy ammo of just about any caliber.
[00:40:08.274 --> 00:40:10.574]  You can't buy any primers for reloading.
[00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:19.677]  And I have concerns that maybe they're trying to prevent the Patriots from being able to defend themselves or respond if something happens in the near future.
[00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:24.439]  Because we see Josh Hawley saying he's going to be denying the Electoral College vote.
[00:40:24.979 --> 00:40:28.960]  We're seeing January 6th, thousands if not millions headed to D.C.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.421]  And so as we're all preparing to defend ourselves and our families and our liberty,
[00:40:34.051 --> 00:40:38.372]  It seems like there's someone or something denying us the ability to defend ourselves with ammo.
[00:40:38.392 --> 00:40:40.152]  And I don't know if you've heard or seen anything about it.
[00:40:40.172 --> 00:40:41.853]  Well, we know the globalists want our guns.
[00:40:41.873 --> 00:40:51.155]  I mean, the UN's official policy at their UNIDIR board is civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:40:51.595 --> 00:40:54.396]  Well, that's a true statement other than legitimate power monopoly.
[00:40:54.456 --> 00:40:55.276]  Power monopoly
[00:40:55.876 --> 00:40:56.536]  Exactly.
[00:40:56.576 --> 00:40:57.757]  You know, when you go to a 7277, remember,
[00:41:19.212 --> 00:41:30.216]  When you talk about the State Department working with the United Nations to disarm not only the American people, but they want to create an international military force to be able to implement their government control.
[00:41:35.063 --> 00:41:38.584]  Look up, say, apartment memorandum 200, Henry Kissinger, depopulate the third world.
[00:41:38.984 --> 00:41:39.785]  It's all there.
[00:41:40.105 --> 00:41:42.145]  And the left goes, oh, open us up to the third world.
[00:41:42.185 --> 00:41:47.607]  They collapsed the third world on purpose and then flood us with them as a weapon, making us all destroy each other.
[00:41:47.987 --> 00:41:48.988]  Thank you, sir, for the call.
[00:41:51.348 --> 00:41:52.509]  A little short segment coming up.
[00:41:52.549 --> 00:41:53.649]  I'll take a few more calls.
[00:41:53.749 --> 00:41:56.730]  Then we've got special guests joining us.
[00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:01.132]  Joe Hoff from GatewayPundit.com are the leading groups with their
[00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:11.395]  You know, laser beams right on election fraud and the latest developments coming up in our number two, InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:42:11.995 --> 00:42:20.699]  Coming up next segment in about five minutes, Joe Hoffman, Gateway Pundit's got all the latest intel on the fight to expose the election fraud that is mountainous.
[00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:22.440]  It's like saying, where are the mountains?
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.141]  And you're in the Himalayas and you're like, you're in them.
[00:42:26.362 --> 00:42:28.243]  Let's take a few more calls before he joins us.
[00:42:28.303 --> 00:42:31.084]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Florida.
[00:42:31.165 --> 00:42:31.785]  Adam, you're on the air.
[00:42:32.851 --> 00:42:35.552]  Alex, man, I'm just excited to get Hunter in there.
[00:42:35.572 --> 00:42:41.354]  I heard he's going to run the White House official Pornhub channel, and he's also... I appreciate your call, Adam.
[00:42:41.835 --> 00:42:46.576]  If you've got any serious, real stuff against Trump, you disagree, you're welcome to call in.
[00:42:46.596 --> 00:42:49.398]  But if you call in and just say stupid stuff, we're not going to talk to you.
[00:42:50.238 --> 00:42:51.298]  That's Howard Stern Show.
[00:42:51.318 --> 00:42:51.738]  Call into that.
[00:42:51.758 --> 00:42:52.279]  It's pretty funny.
[00:42:52.999 --> 00:42:54.099]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:42:54.119 --> 00:42:55.760]  Let's talk to Jefferson in Virginia.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.021]  Jefferson, you're on the air.
[00:42:57.061 --> 00:42:57.361]  Welcome.
[00:42:58.861 --> 00:42:59.441]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:42:59.482 --> 00:43:00.222]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:43:02.298 --> 00:43:04.859]  Welcome, go ahead.
[00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:07.980]  We're in a precarious situation here, and I think we have a way of getting out of it.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:19.125]  Ivan Reikland has a great idea about the two-hour debate period after they contest the states, the seven states that are swing states, and have contested electors.
[00:43:19.805 --> 00:43:22.486]  But what they really ought to do is expand that to every state.
[00:43:22.526 --> 00:43:31.890]  They should contest every state, which gives them 100 hours of debate time, and the emergency alert system should be used to telecast that very debate for 100 hours, which means
[00:43:32.606 --> 00:43:38.112]  If you're there on the 6th, they won't have a final vote until Friday or Saturday at the earliest.
[00:43:38.832 --> 00:43:42.936]  That will tie them up and give us free time to take over the airways and essentially make our case for 100 hours.
[00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:48.500]  I mean, this is a foreign takeover.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:44:00.487]  I think everything and anything is on the table, but we need a coalition of governors, a coalition of legislatures that recognize a foreign takeover and or the president coming out and saying it and giving us marching orders.
[00:44:01.147 --> 00:44:06.931]  We need George Washington to stand up right now and if Trump leads, I'm ready to follow against this foreign takeover.
[00:44:07.771 --> 00:44:15.758]  I mean, we are being raped, we are having our birthright taken, we are being taken over, the globalists admit it, and Trump should use the emergency alert system.
[00:44:16.078 --> 00:44:18.560]  They are using the emergency alert system right now against him.
[00:44:19.921 --> 00:44:26.527]  That's what all those announcements on the internet are, that he's wrong and he's a liar on COVID-19 and on the election.
[00:44:26.947 --> 00:44:32.072]  That is all internet kill switch, Obama, EAS 2.0, and Trump should be using it.
[00:44:33.544 --> 00:44:35.027]  Alright, so you guys have Ivan's number.
[00:44:35.048 --> 00:44:40.520]  Somebody should call him and say, you should take advantage of this opportunity to basically control Congress for a hundred hours.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.703]  That's like four or five days.
[00:44:42.505 --> 00:44:43.808]  Where if Mo Brooks and, uh...
[00:44:44.718 --> 00:44:51.584]  Holly or all these senators and congressmen can agree, start with Alabama, start with Alaska, and just say we can test these.
[00:44:51.804 --> 00:44:53.205]  That gives us two hours of debate.
[00:44:53.485 --> 00:44:57.508]  We'll put it on television and we'll make our case then right in front of Congress.
[00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:00.230]  So this way Congress can't say they didn't see it.
[00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:04.533]  It's like a captive audience situation where they have to be there to listen to the debate.
[00:45:04.673 --> 00:45:07.736]  We can put it on the airways over the emergency alert system.
[00:45:08.216 --> 00:45:09.257]  Everybody gets to hear.
[00:45:09.992 --> 00:45:19.096]  It's like this report this morning on American Journal where they were talking about in Pennsylvania they clearly stole 35,000 votes at 1108 on election night.
[00:45:19.156 --> 00:45:20.856]  It's right there, the Edson system.
[00:45:22.057 --> 00:45:25.878]  Switched the votes, 35,000 of them, and no one knows this happened.
[00:45:25.898 --> 00:45:29.900]  That's only gotten like 222 views on the internet.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.600]  It's amazing.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.302]  That's right, we have the raw footage of that and Joe Hoff can speak to that when we come back.
[00:45:34.322 --> 00:45:34.882]  Thank you for the call.
[00:45:36.243 --> 00:45:38.444]  By the way, I started thinking about what that first caller said.
[00:45:38.464 --> 00:45:40.246]  I thought he was being a smart mouth.
[00:45:40.926 --> 00:45:44.448]  And then I realized, Hunter, I guess, is bigger than that.
[00:45:44.548 --> 00:45:46.189]  He's a pedophile, really, the evidence shows.
[00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.970]  Hunter Biden.
[00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.251]  So, caller, you can call back.
[00:45:48.311 --> 00:45:48.911]  I apologize.
[00:45:49.271 --> 00:45:50.812]  I thought you were being a prank caller.
[00:45:51.352 --> 00:45:52.633]  I'm in such a bad mood right now.
[00:45:52.653 --> 00:45:53.894]  I don't want to say I'm in a bad mood.
[00:45:53.914 --> 00:45:56.316]  I am enraged by what's going on.
[00:45:56.436 --> 00:45:58.137]  And now I have this filter of anger.
[00:45:58.737 --> 00:46:01.961]  That I'm having to deal with and that then makes me make mistakes.
[00:46:02.021 --> 00:46:06.306]  So, uh, after I hung up on that caller, I was like, he wasn't being smart mouth.
[00:46:06.327 --> 00:46:07.087]  He was being serious.
[00:46:07.168 --> 00:46:07.888]  And so I apologize.
[00:46:07.908 --> 00:46:09.811]  The caller, the caller before the last one.
[00:46:10.552 --> 00:46:11.933]  Um, it's just, things are insane.
[00:46:11.994 --> 00:46:12.634]  Things are insane.
[00:46:12.654 --> 00:46:16.519]  We've got to keep our love going and know we're doing this for our children and for freedom.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.300]  We don't do this.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:17.901]  We hate the enemy.
[00:46:17.981 --> 00:46:20.282]  But I'm having some real, real anger problems.
[00:46:20.322 --> 00:46:22.403]  I know you are as well, so stay with me.
[00:46:22.443 --> 00:46:25.284]  Back in 60 seconds with Joe Hoft of GatewayPundit.com.
[00:46:25.364 --> 00:46:27.685]  Alex Jones with Band.Video.
[00:46:27.725 --> 00:46:29.686]  Not band like a music band, you know, like it's been banned.
[00:46:30.126 --> 00:46:32.407]  Band, like censored.Video.
[00:46:32.627 --> 00:46:37.369]  Well, Joe Hoft is a major corporate auditor and fraud investigator.
[00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:40.271]  He was drafted by his brother at GatewayPundit.com.
[00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:40.991]  It's
[00:46:58.629 --> 00:47:01.992]  The main testing they're using is 96% false.
[00:47:02.032 --> 00:47:04.053]  The inventor said it's totally false.
[00:47:04.494 --> 00:47:05.534]  The PCR testing.
[00:47:06.475 --> 00:47:10.158]  So he'll give us in the next two segments his breakdown on both those fronts.
[00:47:10.198 --> 00:47:14.121]  But a lot of huge developments have happened since he was on with us a few weeks ago.
[00:47:14.141 --> 00:47:18.304]  We're 21 days out from either the coronation of the Chinese agent Biden.
[00:47:19.125 --> 00:47:21.546]  Yeah, Alex, great to be here again, as always.
[00:47:21.586 --> 00:47:22.026]  Great to see you.
[00:47:22.066 --> 00:47:25.667]  And I can really feel the frustration and the rage that you're feeling that you expressed earlier.
[00:47:42.076 --> 00:47:45.723]  This is a, you know, I'm still in the fight mode.
[00:47:45.763 --> 00:47:52.275]  Let's just do everything we can to legally through our system that's in place through our constitution.
[00:47:52.662 --> 00:47:57.544]  To address this stuff, but there's a lot of rage behind it that's keeping us going.
[00:47:57.624 --> 00:48:06.988]  And I don't think the Republicans or the Democrats want to see what's going to happen, you know, if this doesn't get addressed properly through the proper channels.
[00:48:07.088 --> 00:48:08.829]  So here's the good news, Alex.
[00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:11.850]  This morning, two big things in my opinion.
[00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.332]  One, Josh Hawley mentioned, comes out and says, I will
[00:48:16.099 --> 00:48:20.242]  He says, I cannot vote to certify the Electoral College results on January 6th.
[00:48:20.282 --> 00:48:23.184]  So that is a big, that's a big statement.
[00:48:23.485 --> 00:48:24.906]  We've wondered about Holly.
[00:48:24.946 --> 00:48:28.068]  He says a lot of great things, but is he willing to back them up?
[00:48:28.608 --> 00:48:37.154]  And today it appears that he has done that, although I think a lot of Americans would suggest it's, you know, he should have done this second number one.
[00:48:37.194 --> 00:48:39.416]  But at least the Show Me State is showing us.
[00:48:40.885 --> 00:48:41.505]  That's right.
[00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:44.666]  And so, hat tip to Josh Hawley, and that's great news.
[00:48:44.726 --> 00:48:50.027]  And our understanding is there will be some other senators behind him that will be following up.
[00:48:50.107 --> 00:48:54.969]  And actually, I think every single Republican senator should stand up.
[00:48:55.049 --> 00:48:59.590]  If they don't, we will mark them for life.
[00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:02.471]  These people will not get our support ever again.
[00:49:02.831 --> 00:49:06.632]  This is the most atrocious thing that's ever happened to our republic.
[00:49:06.652 --> 00:49:07.752]  We're under a communist.
[00:49:08.303 --> 00:49:08.703]  I think?
[00:49:32.788 --> 00:49:41.398]  Jovan Hutton Pulitzer, who's an inventor and just a real bright guy, come and audit the results of these swing states.
[00:49:41.939 --> 00:49:46.464]  He has the ability to do this in a very short period of time.
[00:49:46.824 --> 00:49:51.069]  Now this morning he was in front of the Senate in Georgia and he gave a presentation.
[00:49:51.505 --> 00:49:53.047]  And it was fantastic.
[00:49:53.087 --> 00:49:55.409]  And I know Alex, reach out to him.
[00:49:55.469 --> 00:49:57.531]  I'm sure he'd be, if you need a contact, let me know.
[00:49:57.951 --> 00:49:59.593]  I'm sure he'd be happy to be on your show.
[00:49:59.913 --> 00:50:14.447]  We need to put pressure on our, on our legislatures at these states and on President Trump to set up an executive order to have him do this and for our legislatures to make this happen before January 6th, if possible.
[00:50:14.827 --> 00:50:17.689]  Mr. Pulitzer can can check balance.
[00:50:17.709 --> 00:50:21.451]  He says I could go through 500,000 ballots in a matter of a couple hours.
[00:50:21.731 --> 00:50:23.472]  He can give us answers just like that.
[00:50:23.952 --> 00:50:29.015]  In Georgia this morning, he presented his case where he shows over and over again.
[00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:30.792]  The fraud that was involved.
[00:50:30.832 --> 00:50:33.714]  And he says, we don't need to get into the machines.
[00:50:33.775 --> 00:50:35.416]  We don't need to get into the code.
[00:50:35.816 --> 00:50:36.337]  All of that.
[00:50:36.457 --> 00:50:40.780]  We don't really maybe even have the time to try to understand the how between the machines.
[00:50:41.181 --> 00:50:44.003]  His theory is, let's look at the ballots.
[00:50:44.043 --> 00:50:45.684]  And he's an expert on this stuff.
[00:50:45.704 --> 00:50:58.475]  He's he's been he's been behind technology that you use when you go through and use your laptop or not your laptop, but your iPhone at an airport to check in.
[00:50:58.931 --> 00:51:05.798]  Or the technology at a polling station as you go drive through it and it'll automatically credit your card.
[00:51:06.458 --> 00:51:07.399]  That's the guy behind.
[00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:13.245]  He said he's got like 12 million devices around 12 billion devices around the world that are using his technology.
[00:51:13.285 --> 00:51:17.128]  So he's no dummy and he knows this this area very well.
[00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:21.552]  And he's he gave a presentation a couple weeks ago that we noted we put it up.
[00:51:21.632 --> 00:51:23.054]  We said we got to get this guy.
[00:51:23.474 --> 00:51:24.454]  In front of the president.
[00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:26.055]  We've reached out to him.
[00:51:26.095 --> 00:51:26.955]  We've worked with him.
[00:51:26.995 --> 00:51:31.557]  We've pushed his name to some individuals that we know with related to Trump.
[00:51:32.037 --> 00:51:37.598]  This guy's the answer because he can legitimately look at the ballots and tell us if they're fraudulent or not.
[00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:40.399]  He can determine if there's creases in a ballot or not.
[00:51:40.419 --> 00:51:42.900]  If there's no creases, it's not a legitimate ballot.
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.081]  And there's other things that he's already identified this morning in Georgia.
[00:51:46.121 --> 00:51:52.303]  He pointed out that the ballots that were going to the Republican areas were different than the ballots going to the Democrat areas.
[00:51:52.743 --> 00:51:52.883]  I think?
[00:52:15.445 --> 00:52:24.489]  Somewhere, by themselves, without the proper segregation of duties or chain of custody, is making a decision on what that ballot should be.
[00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:27.750]  And we know that Dominion has the ability to change ballots.
[00:52:28.131 --> 00:52:35.334]  So 90-some percent of the ballots in one section of Fulton County had to be adjudicated.
[00:52:35.374 --> 00:52:38.015]  This means somebody reviewed all of these.
[00:52:38.575 --> 00:52:42.457]  And what we believe is they switched them all to Biden from Trump.
[00:52:43.187 --> 00:52:46.129]  And so he can, he can check this.
[00:52:46.189 --> 00:52:48.611]  He can see this stuff by just looking at the ballots.
[00:52:48.631 --> 00:52:51.733]  He says, he said this morning, it was a brilliant presentation.
[00:52:51.813 --> 00:52:54.194]  He said, he said, the U.S.
[00:52:54.234 --> 00:52:55.935]  was founded on a piece of paper.
[00:52:56.796 --> 00:52:59.858]  And we need to get those same pieces with the paper today.
[00:52:59.878 --> 00:53:03.240]  It was used in the, in the, in these, this election.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.362]  We need to look at these, these actual paper copies.
[00:53:06.382 --> 00:53:08.964]  He says, the machine is all just a head fake.
[00:53:09.597 --> 00:53:18.120]  We need the ballots, the paper copies, and we can determine, he said, like I mentioned earlier, in two hours he can go through 500,000 or so ballots.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.001]  He can look at them all, and he can tell us what's fraud.
[00:53:21.061 --> 00:53:22.201]  He knows what to look for.
[00:53:22.642 --> 00:53:29.384]  There's various things on these ballots that we don't know about, that he knows about, that should be in place, and if they're not there, then they should be thrown out.
[00:53:29.464 --> 00:53:32.225]  So, some real hope there too, Alex.
[00:53:32.325 --> 00:53:35.366]  You know, two things, Holly, and now this Mr. Pulitzer.
[00:53:37.702 --> 00:53:55.431]  Studying world elections, the UN and the State Department, our own government authority and the precious all-knowing UN, say that if a country doesn't have ballot transparency, doesn't allow poll watchers, that then, and if the methodology is not documented and published, then it's thrown out and they recommend a new election.
[00:53:55.471 --> 00:54:00.654]  Well, bare minimum, Trump should be calling if he doesn't get them to take the right action on January 6th.
[00:54:01.414 --> 00:54:03.175]  It looks like more of that is starting to build towards that.
[00:54:03.215 --> 00:54:03.835]  Very exciting.
[00:54:03.855 --> 00:54:08.638]  Thank God finally some will out there against this takeover.
[00:54:09.218 --> 00:54:13.440]  But he should at least just then call and demand a new election in those states.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.301]  And I think declare the Insurrection Act.
[00:54:16.341 --> 00:54:17.942]  I mean, I think a legitimate reason.
[00:54:18.282 --> 00:54:21.704]  I mean, we've seen that done by Eisenhower because they wouldn't let black kids in school.
[00:54:22.124 --> 00:54:23.065]  This is just as important.
[00:54:23.085 --> 00:54:25.246]  I think everybody's vote is just as important as that.
[00:54:26.138 --> 00:54:27.118]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:27.238 --> 00:54:28.439]  And I agree, Alex.
[00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:33.080]  Whatever needs to be done properly through the various channels, get this thing done right.
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:39.062]  Because nobody has belief that these elections were done properly or that the results are valid.
[00:54:40.122 --> 00:54:43.063]  It's the same signature of fraud in all these states.
[00:54:43.263 --> 00:54:44.244]  It's all done the same way.
[00:54:45.144 --> 00:54:45.584]  That's right.
[00:54:45.624 --> 00:54:47.164]  We saw it the night of the election.
[00:54:47.224 --> 00:54:48.745]  Five or so states all shut down.
[00:54:49.229 --> 00:54:50.170]  And they stopped counting.
[00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:51.891]  When did we ever see that in our election?
[00:54:52.131 --> 00:54:52.351]  Ever.
[00:54:52.992 --> 00:54:53.272]  Ever.
[00:54:53.612 --> 00:54:54.373]  It was shocking.
[00:54:54.413 --> 00:54:56.815]  And then the way the media handled it, big tech, etc.
[00:54:57.115 --> 00:54:58.516]  Big tech warned us ahead of time.
[00:54:58.556 --> 00:55:08.364]  If you say anything on Twitter or Facebook that on election night that somebody's a winner or that there's a fraud, we're going to delete it.
[00:55:08.404 --> 00:55:09.545]  We're not going to let you say that.
[00:55:09.565 --> 00:55:11.927]  Well, that's the other big thing is, you know,
[00:55:13.274 --> 00:55:16.575]  We're not going to let you contest anything, but we're going to contest if we lose.
[00:55:17.595 --> 00:55:22.717]  And all the pre-programming, all the preconditioning, Biden not campaigning because he didn't need to.
[00:55:23.357 --> 00:55:27.978]  And then accelerating the states he won, freezing the states Trump won.
[00:55:28.218 --> 00:55:29.618]  This was ridiculously obvious.
[00:55:30.479 --> 00:55:30.959]  How about it?
[00:55:31.019 --> 00:55:39.581]  And the thing that's really outrageous to Alex is seeing my president, the president of the United States, send out a simple message on a simple
[00:55:40.066 --> 00:55:55.277]  Technology called Twitter or Facebook and having little bold letters underneath it in red or blue saying Joe Biden won the election because somebody told us that and just disregard what this guy's saying because basically they're calling our president a clown.
[00:55:55.618 --> 00:55:58.720]  That just enrages me.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.260]  Me too.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.680]  Absolute gaslighting.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.661]  And imagine how bad it's going to get if they put their CHICOM agent in.
[00:56:04.001 --> 00:56:04.981]  Katie, bar the door.
[00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:07.242]  This is an explosive situation.
[00:56:07.282 --> 00:56:08.302]  Joe Hoff, GatewayPundit.com.
[00:56:08.322 --> 00:56:10.543]  This is our guest on Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:56:10.563 --> 00:56:16.784]  We're going to come back and look more at the election, but also the COVID global rollout lockdown 2 and the fraud.
[00:56:17.364 --> 00:56:18.464]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:56:18.764 --> 00:56:21.085]  Joe Hoff, GatewayPundit.com.
[00:56:21.965 --> 00:56:24.846]  There's been the tip of the spear and this fraud is with us.
[00:56:26.078 --> 00:56:29.784]  And all of this, the UN, the COVID lockdown, it's all about mail-in ballots.
[00:56:29.824 --> 00:56:31.166]  It's all about shutting down society.
[00:56:31.186 --> 00:56:32.588]  It's all about putting the nation under siege.
[00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.351]  It's all about the Great Reset.
[00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:36.634]  It's all about America never reopening.
[00:56:37.014 --> 00:56:39.779]  Communist China has said America's never reopening.
[00:56:39.819 --> 00:56:40.760]  We're totally reopened.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.421]  COVID has...
[00:56:42.102 --> 00:56:46.785]  With one blow helped us defeat America and Bloomberg brags the American century is gone.
[00:56:47.185 --> 00:56:47.986]  Trump is defeated.
[00:56:48.086 --> 00:56:50.947]  Our globalist investments in China are paramount now.
[00:56:51.368 --> 00:56:52.588]  It's all interconnected.
[00:56:52.608 --> 00:57:01.093]  And I know you've worked internationally, lived in Asia just up until earlier this year, tying COVID and the election together and the fraud.
[00:57:01.133 --> 00:57:03.775]  Spend a few minutes on that that you've been spearheading as well.
[00:57:06.038 --> 00:57:08.343]  Yeah, excellent point, Alex.
[00:57:08.363 --> 00:57:10.687]  I lived in Hong Kong for a decade and worked there.
[00:57:10.707 --> 00:57:13.914]  I've been in and out of China maybe a hundred times.
[00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:29.931]  The thing that I noticed after President Trump was elected, even remember the messaging that we got as Obama's years were ending and while they were preparing for the Hillary years, was that, well, the era of the United States is done.
[00:57:30.271 --> 00:57:31.012]  The U.S.
[00:57:31.132 --> 00:57:33.734]  is fading and China is growing.
[00:57:33.754 --> 00:57:36.316]  There was even some reports that China's GDP
[00:57:36.796 --> 00:57:37.196]  We're good.
[00:58:04.313 --> 00:58:13.397]  And in a loving way, as you recall, he went over to China and tried to build a relationship with Xi, and then immediately started doing the things that he needed to do.
[00:58:13.457 --> 00:58:14.738]  And he said it in a loving way to them.
[00:58:14.778 --> 00:58:17.018]  He said, hey, you guys are taking care of your country.
[00:58:17.359 --> 00:58:19.139]  We need people to take care of our country.
[00:58:19.179 --> 00:58:24.262]  You're doing the right thing, trying to protect your country, trying to make yourself prosperous, et cetera.
[00:58:24.502 --> 00:58:26.102]  But we need people that need to do that.
[00:58:26.122 --> 00:58:27.643]  And I don't blame you, China.
[00:58:27.963 --> 00:58:29.224]  I blame our politicians.
[00:58:29.724 --> 00:58:32.205]  And Trump was right, and that strategy worked really well.
[00:58:32.845 --> 00:58:35.366]  And he destroyed China, Alex.
[00:58:35.806 --> 00:58:38.407]  By the end of 2019, the U.S.'
[00:58:38.367 --> 00:58:41.088]  's GDP was almost twice as large as China's.
[00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:44.330]  You won't hear anybody report upon that, but you could see it.
[00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:44.690]  The U.S.
[00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:49.452]  was around 23, and China around 13 or so trillion dollars in GDP.
[00:58:50.733 --> 00:58:54.455]  You could see that companies were moving out of China.
[00:58:54.495 --> 00:59:03.161]  Trump had even encouraged companies to do it because China wouldn't come to the table and sign a trade agreement that was good for all parties.
[00:59:03.221 --> 00:59:05.482]  They continue to steal our intellectual property.
[00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:15.989]  What Trump did was he saw that they need the United States in order to survive and in order for their economy to thrive.
[00:59:16.636 --> 00:59:20.239]  And what he did is he threatened that in a big way.
[00:59:20.259 --> 00:59:21.961]  And so I'm in Hong Kong.
[00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:25.904]  I talked to some CEO who talked to two other CEOs in China.
[00:59:26.311 --> 00:59:28.672]  We're saying the economy was horrible.
[00:59:28.752 --> 00:59:29.972]  That was like two years ago.
[00:59:30.393 --> 00:59:50.800]  A year ago, I talked to a guy who was a plant manager in China, moving a 10,000 member plant down to, they wanted to move to Thailand or to Vietnam, but they couldn't because all the property there was filled up from companies leaving China, getting into Southeast Asia where they can easier do business with the United States.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.801]  They ended up having to put their plants in Thailand.
[00:59:53.201 --> 00:59:54.922]  So businesses were leaving.
[00:59:55.363 --> 00:59:58.765]  Their GDP was going, I believe it was going down.
[00:59:58.825 --> 01:00:01.967]  They've never admitted that, but I believe their GDP went down.
[01:00:02.768 --> 01:00:04.749]  And this was before COVID.
[01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:14.696]  And then Trump got pressured them into signing this, this deal that they didn't want to sign, but they basically had to because Trump had them exactly where, where they needed to be.
[01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:16.338]  He saw that they were at a weak point.
[01:00:16.898 --> 01:00:22.482]  And so here's China in early this year, then dropping this COVID bomb on the world.
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:34.564]  And it was a sinister, yet probably in their eyes, a very successful move on their part, because they haven't been penalized any bit.
[01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:37.325]  No way Joe Biden will penalize them for what they've done.
[01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:42.628]  And the world has suffered immensely, just immensely, as we all know.
[01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:48.270]  Today, Jim, my twin brother, we know a gentleman who's in the hospital.
[01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:55.817]  With COVID and he's over 80 and he's overweight and you know, that's not a good place to be.
[01:00:56.337 --> 01:00:57.779]  And we can thank China for this.
[01:00:58.968 --> 01:01:00.688]  Anyways, let's expand on that.
[01:01:00.729 --> 01:01:11.671]  We have this congressman-elect who they say died of COVID, but then when I read the fine print, it said that Luke Letlow was being intubated in some type of surgery and died of a heart attack.
[01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:13.592]  It says right here, died of a heart attack.
[01:01:13.612 --> 01:01:15.512]  The hospital says that's the New York Post.
[01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:21.034]  Local news says died of a heart attack, but Politico, the New York Times said died of COVID.
[01:01:22.165 --> 01:01:23.926]  That's unbelievable, Alex, isn't it?
[01:01:24.006 --> 01:01:26.267]  The way they've counted numbers has been atrocious.
[01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:27.607]  We brought this up in the summer.
[01:01:28.048 --> 01:01:34.750]  The CDC itself said that only 6% of all deaths that they're counting as COVID deaths are actually caused by COVID only.
[01:01:35.131 --> 01:01:39.292]  The rest are deaths with COVID, not deaths caused by COVID.
[01:01:39.733 --> 01:01:41.333]  And we got a lot of flack for that.
[01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:45.335]  All the fact checkers came after us, even though we were using data from the CDC.
[01:01:45.855 --> 01:01:46.956]  We did it again this week.
[01:01:46.996 --> 01:01:47.556]  Look at 6% of the 330,000
[01:01:50.628 --> 01:01:51.916]  Deaths is closer to 20,000.
[01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:56.098]  And deaths that are just from COVID.
[01:01:56.298 --> 01:02:05.979]  And you know the statistic I've found that really gets people, as you know, two months ago, John Hopkins ran a story saying year to date about the same number died in 2019 and died this year.
[01:02:06.239 --> 01:02:09.640]  Well, they all went well, maybe CDC numbers aren't all in and the year isn't over.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.100]  So now I've hired a statistician we've used before.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:12.841]  He's got a degree.
[01:02:13.221 --> 01:02:17.541]  He's a well-known guy, but we don't use his name because you'll get attacked, you know, telling the truth as you were just saying.
[01:02:18.122 --> 01:02:20.362]  Journalists, doctors that come out and tell the truth get fired.
[01:02:21.142 --> 01:02:28.808]  But he's looking at the numbers, he's almost done with them, and it looks like we may have less dead this year than actually died in 2019.
[01:02:29.128 --> 01:02:31.390]  That number, there's no way they can avoid that.
[01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:33.103]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[01:02:33.143 --> 01:02:33.903]  And here's another thing.
[01:02:33.923 --> 01:02:35.645]  Somebody sent me an email just recently.
[01:02:35.665 --> 01:02:47.454]  I haven't acted on it yet as far as written anything up, but said, hey, look, usually these flu seasons begin in like November or October of the prior year and end around whatever, March, let's say.
[01:02:47.754 --> 01:02:53.378]  And yet they're still adding up all these deaths now going forward into their original numbers.
[01:02:53.959 --> 01:03:00.964]  So the whole way they've been managing this, they've been counting for this, the way they've talked about masks, no masks,
[01:03:02.131 --> 01:03:09.413]  And whether you can, and now it's coming out per a study in Florida, that if you don't have any symptoms, there's no way you're getting anybody sick.
[01:03:09.793 --> 01:03:12.753]  And so people are just, you know, have had enough, you know?
[01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:15.054]  And people are at a tipping point here.
[01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:17.254]  So that needs to be addressed.
[01:03:17.274 --> 01:03:18.175]  I totally agree with you.
[01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:19.235]  And I want to start a slogan.
[01:03:19.775 --> 01:03:22.575]  The only way the masks are coming off is if we take them off.
[01:03:23.036 --> 01:03:26.836]  And I've been doing this for a long time, but with my family or friends, I don't make a scene.
[01:03:26.876 --> 01:03:28.557]  I wear the mask in the restaurant until we sit down.
[01:03:28.797 --> 01:03:29.617]  I'm not doing it now.
[01:03:30.177 --> 01:03:34.079]  And I'm going around everywhere and I'm educating people nicely and lovingly about it.
[01:03:34.879 --> 01:03:36.740]  And they're backing down.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.361]  Now I've noticed they will bully women.
[01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:41.562]  There's something about men and women will bully another woman if they're not wearing a mask.
[01:03:41.582 --> 01:03:43.363]  But I've noticed they're pretty much leaving men alone.
[01:03:44.335 --> 01:03:48.416]  Yeah, we had a, there was a girl who was on Twitter who decided she'd had enough.
[01:03:48.836 --> 01:03:52.297]  And we put up a post yesterday just when it took off.
[01:03:53.017 --> 01:03:54.177]  Because a lot of people have had enough.
[01:03:54.457 --> 01:03:56.798]  You know, we're just, you know, we're tired of wearing these masks.
[01:03:56.878 --> 01:04:01.859]  Alright, well listen, I hope to see you up there on January 6th, but regardless, thanks for popping in and giving us updates.
[01:04:02.199 --> 01:04:05.340]  Joe Hoffman, you and your brother and crew are kicking butt over at GatewayPlanet.com.
[01:04:06.345 --> 01:04:07.765]  God bless America, Alex.
[01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:08.806]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:04:08.826 --> 01:04:10.226]  Pray for America, pray for justice.
[01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:12.227]  And Joe Biden might drop dead any minute.
[01:04:12.287 --> 01:04:13.507]  I mean, who knows what's going to happen?
[01:04:13.927 --> 01:04:14.587]  We don't want that to happen.
[01:04:14.607 --> 01:04:15.608]  We don't want him to turn into a martyr.
[01:04:15.928 --> 01:04:17.988]  I'm just saying, things are very, very fluid.
[01:04:18.249 --> 01:04:20.689]  He's already calling her the president again, Joe Biden is.
[01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:23.210]  We'll be right back with that whistleblower nurse.
[01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:26.811]  Nurse Erin Olszewski is about to be with us.
[01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:29.172]  I really appreciate her coming on on short notice.
[01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:42.512]  Because she's the big whistleblower, and we've had so many other doctors and nurses expose this, but she was one of the first to say, healthy people come in, they test non-positive, we still intubate them, and the breathing machine kills them.
[01:04:44.093 --> 01:04:47.894]  Well, that's, it looks like what happened with this new congressman-elect.
[01:04:48.654 --> 01:04:54.576]  They said they did a medical procedure intubating him, and he died of a heart attack during it, and now they're saying he died of COVID-19.
[01:04:57.056 --> 01:05:02.961]  The last cellmate of Jeffrey Epstein was also found with his neck broken in his apartment.
[01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:03.682]  He'd been released.
[01:05:04.282 --> 01:05:05.363]  They said COVID killed him.
[01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:09.306]  Did you know Kennedy in 1963 got killed by COVID?
[01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:11.668]  Jesus was killed by COVID before he rose from the grave.
[01:05:11.928 --> 01:05:13.009]  Now, I'm not trying to be blasphemous.
[01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:14.270]  I'm saying it's sarcastic.
[01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:16.692]  It's ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:19.655]  The Hindenburg was brought down by COVID.
[01:05:21.707 --> 01:05:22.568]  Simply insane.
[01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:23.749]  We're going to go to her in just a moment.
[01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:25.691]  Folks are very excited.
[01:05:25.831 --> 01:05:27.673]  I know that I am excited as well.
[01:05:28.974 --> 01:05:32.478]  X2 is an essential nutrient.
[01:05:33.139 --> 01:05:37.823]  It is clean, pure atomic iodine from 12,000 foot deep crystals.
[01:05:38.544 --> 01:05:40.366]  It's a byproduct of oil and gas drilling.
[01:05:41.613 --> 01:05:46.097]  We're the only ones to ever go out and actually get this type of true, pure, atomic iodine.
[01:05:46.117 --> 01:05:47.738]  We have to get a DEA license to get it.
[01:05:47.758 --> 01:05:48.479]  It's crazy.
[01:05:48.499 --> 01:05:49.840]  It goes right into your cells.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.601]  It's essential.
[01:05:51.101 --> 01:05:54.784]  It's the good halogen, the opposite of fluoride and bromide and bromine and all of that.
[01:05:55.264 --> 01:05:56.646]  Look into the iodine conspiracy.
[01:05:56.666 --> 01:05:57.726]  This is the best you're going to get.
[01:05:58.516 --> 01:05:59.337]  It's back in stock.
[01:05:59.717 --> 01:06:00.818]  X2 sold out for months.
[01:06:01.559 --> 01:06:02.480]  50% off.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.341]  People are very excited.
[01:06:03.822 --> 01:06:06.264]  Also back in stock after eight months because the COVID lockdown.
[01:06:06.484 --> 01:06:07.385]  Couldn't get it from France.
[01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:08.627]  Pollen Block.
[01:06:08.707 --> 01:06:10.268]  It's from specially fed quail.
[01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:12.551]  Their eggs have this natural antihistamine.
[01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:13.532]  It's amazing.
[01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:14.072]  People love it.
[01:06:15.454 --> 01:06:17.036]  It gives you that anti-allergy effect.
[01:06:17.677 --> 01:06:19.580]  Some better for others, but it works for most folks.
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.342]  Not for some people, just like some medicines don't.
[01:06:21.763 --> 01:06:23.084]  This is all natural from quail eggs.
[01:06:23.745 --> 01:06:24.486]  It's back in stock.
[01:06:24.546 --> 01:06:25.848]  Pollen Block is back in stock.
[01:06:26.289 --> 01:06:29.834]  And also back in stock is our fluoride-free concentrated
[01:06:31.496 --> 01:06:34.697]  Okay, let's now go to Nurse Erin Olszewski.
[01:06:34.737 --> 01:06:35.958]  So much has happened, so much has unfolded.
[01:06:35.978 --> 01:06:38.359]  Now the vaccine's rolling out, people are dying from the vaccine.
[01:07:01.454 --> 01:07:04.397]  South Korea, in Switzerland, in Germany.
[01:07:04.717 --> 01:07:07.420]  There's reports of them covering up deaths here in the U.S.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:11.323]  There's all these ER head doctors collapsing, nurses collapsing.
[01:07:12.284 --> 01:07:13.826]  People are getting Bell's palsy.
[01:07:13.966 --> 01:07:22.393]  I want somebody who's really got her nose to the grindstone as a registered nurse watching all this, who's also got her big conference coming up for nurses that was going to be in Florida.
[01:07:22.694 --> 01:07:23.655]  Now it's going to be in D.C.
[01:07:23.715 --> 01:07:24.295]  on the 6th.
[01:07:24.756 --> 01:07:26.697]  I look forward to hopefully meeting her in person.
[01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:32.993]  Yeah, it's history repeating itself, you know, and that's why a lot of us have been very outspoken to stop this from happening.
[01:07:46.383 --> 01:07:49.446]  It's really hard to get people to actually listen and pay attention.
[01:07:49.526 --> 01:07:55.691]  But the more that this is happening, the more people are really starting to listen.
[01:07:55.771 --> 01:08:01.275]  You know, we're looking around and, you know, you were talking about Luke Letlow a little bit ago.
[01:08:01.295 --> 01:08:04.098]  I mean, that likely could have been avoided.
[01:08:04.438 --> 01:08:12.585]  You know, I don't know the details of everything, but obviously we knew the ventilators are literally killing people.
[01:08:12.885 --> 01:08:16.108]  And that's ultimately, I think, what ended up killing him.
[01:08:19.744 --> 01:08:23.007]  I could ask a million questions, but you're really the expert.
[01:08:23.948 --> 01:08:27.332]  Being a nurse, being on the front lines, you were at the epicenter of the epicenter.
[01:08:27.352 --> 01:08:29.174]  Your book is of that title.
[01:08:29.294 --> 01:08:34.579]  Explain to people the hospital you were in and what you saw, and then moving it forward 10 months, what you're witnessing now.
[01:08:36.441 --> 01:08:41.526]  Well, I was in New York at Elmhurst Hospital, so that was known as the epicenter of the epicenter, I guess.
[01:08:43.877 --> 01:08:46.719]  Ultimately, it was kind of an assembly line to a body bag.
[01:08:46.759 --> 01:08:51.522]  These patients would come in with symptoms of whatever.
[01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:54.204]  I mean, it honestly really didn't matter at that point.
[01:08:54.244 --> 01:09:11.675]  They were considered COVID patients and, you know, shuttled off to floors, you know, mismanaged treatment and protocols that were knowingly killing these patients, ultimately putting them on ventilators and they'd end up, you know, in the freezer trucks in the back.
[01:09:12.225 --> 01:09:14.528]  And, you know, they weren't dying from COVID.
[01:09:14.548 --> 01:09:22.056]  They were dying from the treatments, the medications, the medications that they wouldn't use.
[01:09:22.076 --> 01:09:24.539]  You know, they refused any alternative treatments.
[01:09:24.579 --> 01:09:30.145]  It was ventilators, sedatives, paralytics, and, you know, just drugs.
[01:09:30.425 --> 01:09:33.168]  They just drugged them up till their bodies couldn't handle it anymore.
[01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:36.489]  And, um, you know, this is still happening.
[01:09:52.077 --> 01:09:55.139]  But still were intubated and were basically killed.
[01:09:55.219 --> 01:09:58.041]  I mean, it doesn't get more dramatic than this.
[01:09:58.081 --> 01:10:02.204]  And you're talking to other health care providers about what's going on and how scandalous this is.
[01:10:02.504 --> 01:10:03.365]  This isn't a movie.
[01:10:03.385 --> 01:10:07.267]  This isn't some made-for-TV shocker about a crazy hospital where they're killing people.
[01:10:07.607 --> 01:10:09.649]  This is a systematic operation.
[01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.330]  It is.
[01:10:12.591 --> 01:10:14.252]  And it's still going on.
[01:10:14.672 --> 01:10:15.352]  And they know it.
[01:10:15.553 --> 01:10:16.393]  That's the problem.
[01:10:16.673 --> 01:10:19.575]  They know they're killing these patients.
[01:10:19.835 --> 01:10:20.456]  First of all,
[01:10:21.089 --> 01:10:33.813]  You know, they're not even listening to us, you know, and so I really, really appreciate, I mean, you putting this out there and, you know, other nurses and doctors coming forward, but ultimately they censor us.
[01:10:33.853 --> 01:10:37.194]  They are censoring us so hard that we have to take it boots on the ground.
[01:10:37.514 --> 01:10:40.975]  And, you know, this is how we're going to stop it.
[01:10:41.115 --> 01:10:44.556]  And hopefully this will wake up a lot more patriots.
[01:10:44.836 --> 01:10:46.757]  Like the, we, we have to stop this.
[01:10:47.728 --> 01:10:52.612]  Because every single day we're watching the news and there's more and more people dying and it's unnecessary.
[01:10:52.672 --> 01:10:53.773]  They don't have to die.
[01:10:53.933 --> 01:10:55.434]  People don't have to die.
[01:10:55.454 --> 01:11:01.098]  This is treatable.
[01:11:01.138 --> 01:11:03.620]  Honestly, it's very unnecessary and it's awful.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.883]  It does feel like a movie, but it's not.
[01:11:07.183 --> 01:11:12.627]  This is where our world is right now and we're at a very, very slippery slope.
[01:11:14.517 --> 01:11:22.220]  This can go in a very bad direction very quickly if people don't, you know, start researching and speaking up and getting involved, you know.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:22.581]  You're right.
[01:11:22.621 --> 01:11:24.481]  This is an authoritarian takeover.
[01:11:24.502 --> 01:11:30.784]  When we come back, ER nurse tests positive for COVID-19, eight days after receiving it, says, what's the point?
[01:11:31.004 --> 01:11:34.246]  Well, Pfizer and Moderna have told us this won't protect you from COVID.
[01:11:34.446 --> 01:11:36.027]  They've told us it won't stop you spreading it.
[01:11:36.347 --> 01:11:38.208]  That's why Bill Gates says you gotta take five a year.
[01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:39.488]  So what is the point?
[01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:40.389]  It's a problem?
[01:11:41.405 --> 01:11:42.805]  In search of a solution.
[01:11:43.285 --> 01:11:44.346]  And there is no solution.
[01:11:44.406 --> 01:11:46.046]  It's the perfect corporate takeover.
[01:11:48.747 --> 01:11:48.987]  Yeah.
[01:11:49.307 --> 01:11:51.667]  I mean, why would they want to fix something like this?
[01:11:51.787 --> 01:11:52.608]  This is the plan.
[01:11:52.948 --> 01:11:57.329]  You know, the system is not built to help people.
[01:11:57.729 --> 01:12:01.890]  You know, the system is built and it's working exactly how it's built.
[01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:03.170]  It's intended
[01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:03.993]  Yeah.
[01:12:13.211 --> 01:12:17.554]  Well, that's right.
[01:12:17.574 --> 01:12:21.917]  Going back 20 years ago, many medical schools got rid of the Hippocratic Oath of Hippocrates, as you know.
[01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:22.918]  Do no harm.
[01:12:23.358 --> 01:12:25.400]  Because we've seen a lot of medical tyrannies throughout history.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.241]  We've seen the priest clasped of doctors.
[01:12:27.682 --> 01:12:33.546]  Many cultures would become abusive because they had the hidden knowledge, and they would use it against the people, even the royalty.
[01:12:34.006 --> 01:12:43.733]  And so we're right back there again with a medical tyranny, a world ID, a corporate takeover, wanting to force us to take things in our bodies and claiming they have liability protection from that.
[01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:45.475]  That's a godlike power, isn't it?
[01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:52.760]  Well, yeah, I mean, the oath, the Hippocratic Oath is long gone in the health care system.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:59.645]  And, you know, even those that do want to follow their oath and do what's right, I mean, we're fired.
[01:12:59.765 --> 01:13:00.526]  We are fired.
[01:13:01.579 --> 01:13:02.519]  Censored.
[01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:04.540]  Some have lost their jobs.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:08.180]  There's license being threatened for doing what's right.
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.420]  That's terrifying.
[01:13:10.481 --> 01:13:12.761]  And no, these companies don't have liability.
[01:13:12.801 --> 01:13:17.802]  These hospitals right now don't have liability because we're under this emergency situation.
[01:13:17.882 --> 01:13:24.243]  So under the guise of public health, they use it to take control.
[01:13:24.563 --> 01:13:26.403]  And yeah, liability-free.
[01:13:26.443 --> 01:13:28.764]  Nothing good comes from anything liability-free.
[01:13:29.844 --> 01:13:30.764]  It's dangerous.
[01:13:31.557 --> 01:13:32.221]  Again, I've got him.
[01:13:33.359 --> 01:13:49.070]  I've got a million questions here I want to get to, but I want to ask you, when you're talking to other medical people, what they're saying, what they're planning to do, because everybody I know in the medical field is really awake and really angry and mad that they're being persecuted and told to shut up, not just censored online, and they're being told, take these inoculations.
[01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:54.393]  And I know people very closely that work in the medical field that did take the shot and got really sick from it, but are scared to go public.
[01:13:54.594 --> 01:13:56.415]  Nurse Erin Olszewski is our guest.
[01:13:56.435 --> 01:14:01.979]  She's one of the most important whistleblowers, if not the most important to go public, showing all the videos.
[01:14:02.759 --> 01:14:09.165]  Of homeless people they just grab up, bring in, they didn't have COVID, stick a tube down their lungs, blow their lungs out, kill them.
[01:14:10.086 --> 01:14:11.046]  She got all the footage.
[01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:12.268]  Where's the FBI?
[01:14:12.328 --> 01:14:12.628]  Nowhere.
[01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:19.034]  You saw them send folks with COVID into nursing homes where they don't have vitamin D3 to give you about half the deaths in the country.
[01:14:19.932 --> 01:14:21.313]  And now it's all happening again.
[01:14:22.053 --> 01:14:28.415]  There are videos of a medical doctor in a major state of Germany in the parliament saying, I've called the head doctors.
[01:14:28.736 --> 01:14:30.516]  There's no one in our hospitals with COVID.
[01:14:30.976 --> 01:14:33.397]  But the same hospitals are on the news saying we're overwhelmed.
[01:14:33.798 --> 01:14:34.898]  It's not even the doctors doing it.
[01:14:34.938 --> 01:14:38.559]  It's the PR firms that corporately run these damn hospitals.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:47.924]  This footage is just pouring out, but here's an ER nurse test positive for COVID-19 eight days after receiving the vaccine and says, what is the point?
[01:14:47.964 --> 01:15:02.993]  Well, a lot of evidence shows it gives you a false positive, not just for COVID or any other coronavirus, but also for HIV because the coronavirus is a chimera with HIV delivery system, not HIV, the HIV P shuttle gene insertion.
[01:15:03.273 --> 01:15:03.693]  Here it is.
[01:15:04.974 --> 01:15:08.796]  I think this illustrates that the vaccine effectiveness is not immediate.
[01:15:09.758 --> 01:15:16.840]  Health experts weighing in after a local nurse tested positive for COVID-19 eight days after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:26.283]  As ABC 10 News reporter Michael Chen tells us, a doctor involved with the local vaccine rollout says this case does not reveal anything about the vaccine's effectiveness.
[01:15:27.492 --> 01:15:35.256]  This was a Facebook post from Matthew, an ER nurse at two different local hospitals after receiving the Pfizer vaccine December 18th.
[01:15:35.396 --> 01:15:38.978]  He tells me his arm was sore for a day, but he suffered no other side effects.
[01:15:39.098 --> 01:15:45.561]  Six days later, on Christmas Eve, after working a shift in the COVID unit, he became sick, he writes in another Facebook post.
[01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:48.682]  He got the chills and later came down with muscle aches and fatigue.
[01:15:48.742 --> 01:15:53.925]  The day after Christmas, he went to a drive-up hospital testing site and tested positive for COVID-19.
[01:15:54.685 --> 01:15:55.846]  No, not expected at all.
[01:15:55.866 --> 01:16:00.247]  And when you work through the numbers, this is exactly what we would expect to happen if someone is exposed.
[01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:06.350]  Dr. Christian Ramers is an infectious disease specialist on the clinical advisory panel for the county's vaccine rollout.
[01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:13.193]  He points out it's possible Matthew may have been infected before receiving the vaccine, as the incubation period may be as much as two weeks.
[01:16:13.253 --> 01:16:19.095]  But Dr. Ramers says if Matthew did contract it after the vaccine, it's still in line with what we know.
[01:16:19.668 --> 01:16:25.133]  We also know from the vaccine clinical trials that it takes about 10 to 14 days for you to start to develop.
[01:16:25.253 --> 01:16:26.534]  Okay, so let's shut this down.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:29.621]  We have Pfizer saying it may not even protect you.
[01:16:29.641 --> 01:16:32.102]  We have the head of the WHO vaccine program.
[01:16:32.462 --> 01:16:34.163]  She came out on Monday and says it doesn't help you.
[01:16:34.783 --> 01:16:36.664]  Every level of this is a fraud, Erin.
[01:16:36.704 --> 01:16:37.524]  What's really going on?
[01:16:37.724 --> 01:16:44.587]  I mean, you burrow into the testing, you burrow into the virus, you burrow into where it came from, you burrow into is the vaccine effective?
[01:16:44.648 --> 01:16:45.168]  Is it safe?
[01:16:45.228 --> 01:16:46.088]  It's all lies.
[01:16:46.428 --> 01:16:48.649]  I mean, what is this giant criminal rollout?
[01:16:48.989 --> 01:16:51.110]  I mean, I guess they're just going for broke and don't care.
[01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:53.591]  Money.
[01:16:54.272 --> 01:16:54.732]  Control.
[01:16:55.779 --> 01:17:02.202]  I mean, the vaccine is, I think we discussed this last time, but it's literally going to cause a mass genocide.
[01:17:02.362 --> 01:17:07.985]  It's going to create revenue for hospitals, pharmaceutical companies.
[01:17:08.105 --> 01:17:17.149]  You know, there's, first of all, I mean, what do we need a vaccine for, you know, with a virus that has a 99.9% survival rate?
[01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:19.910]  It's literally, I mean, it's common sense.
[01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:22.391]  We don't, you know, and there,
[01:17:23.174 --> 01:17:25.356]  They've been promoting this for a long time.
[01:17:25.376 --> 01:17:28.578]  I honestly think that this is what it's always been about.
[01:17:28.918 --> 01:17:31.000]  It's always been about this vaccine.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.922]  And they started with the Yale study.
[01:17:34.522 --> 01:17:44.429]  It was a few months ago that they funded a Yale study on how to convince people to vaccinate with the COVID vaccine.
[01:17:44.489 --> 01:17:46.831]  So I mean, they're putting a lot of money into this.
[01:17:47.011 --> 01:17:47.371]  So why?
[01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:53.178]  It just, it always just points right back to money.
[01:17:53.498 --> 01:17:55.358]  Money is the root of all evil with this.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:02.400]  Continue.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:02.980]  Sorry.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.300]  Yeah, please continue.
[01:18:05.201 --> 01:18:06.081]  My mic was breaking.
[01:18:06.121 --> 01:18:07.601]  I was switching mics out while you were talking.
[01:18:07.661 --> 01:18:08.061]  Go ahead.
[01:18:09.462 --> 01:18:10.122]  I'm like, all right.
[01:18:10.422 --> 01:18:15.483]  No, you know, even just the, just the scripts in general.
[01:18:15.603 --> 01:18:19.244]  So I have had a lot of nurses messaging me from all over
[01:18:19.824 --> 01:18:29.448]  The United States Globe, they're receiving, you know, emails of scripts of what to say and how to promote this vaccine.
[01:18:30.328 --> 01:18:41.152]  And if you look around right now, ever since this rolled out, you'll notice that there's a lot more medical professionals and nurses within these hospitals coming out on social media.
[01:18:41.532 --> 01:18:47.554]  You know, I vaccinated, you have to do this too, you know, trying to create this norm.
[01:18:47.634 --> 01:18:48.875]  And it's really disappointing.
[01:18:49.841 --> 01:19:07.577]  For me, being part of this, you know, in this profession, to look around and I'm disappointed, you know, that they are pressuring the public to take a vaccine that is literally causing more harm than
[01:19:09.241 --> 01:19:09.481]  Ever.
[01:19:09.722 --> 01:19:16.750]  And that's really what they're setting the precedent for, is like a form of human sacrifice, where we know we're dying, we know it's hurting us, but under peer pressure we just do it.
[01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:26.562]  We know it doesn't protect us, we know it rewrites our genetics, we know it has all these side effects, we don't even know what the long-term effects are, it's not even a vaccine, it's an mRNA that literally takes over our DNA.
[01:19:26.942 --> 01:19:27.703]  I mean, this is next
[01:19:28.644 --> 01:19:29.724]  Of course.
[01:19:29.744 --> 01:19:31.785]  I mean, that's exactly what they want.
[01:19:31.825 --> 01:19:33.345]  So how do we get people to start saying no?
[01:19:33.365 --> 01:19:34.285]  I feel I'm looking around and it's
[01:19:57.779 --> 01:20:11.061]  I literally feel like I'm living in the Twilight Zone and I don't know how to convince people and show them the truth, you know, because it is so hard because we're so censored.
[01:20:11.261 --> 01:20:25.264]  And if that isn't a red flag for people that, you know, aren't convinced that maybe this vaccine is as awful as we say it is, you know, just the censorship should kind of have them start questioning this a little bit more.
[01:20:29.056 --> 01:20:35.982]  I could ask a million different questions here, but as a nurse, as a whistleblower, as a mother, as a patriot, what other points would you like to make to the American people?
[01:20:39.025 --> 01:20:39.926]  Gosh, there's a lot.
[01:20:40.126 --> 01:20:48.794]  Well, first of all, I do have a lot of nurses coming in on the 6th of January.
[01:20:49.154 --> 01:20:50.215]  We're going to be speaking at 9 a.m.
[01:20:52.825 --> 01:20:54.526]  In downtown Washington.
[01:20:54.967 --> 01:20:56.588]  And by the way, I'm going to be there.
[01:20:56.668 --> 01:20:58.749]  I was invited by Mr. Bigtree to be at that.
[01:20:59.150 --> 01:20:59.910]  Owen was as well.
[01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:02.012]  I look forward to being there with you at 9 a.m.
[01:21:02.352 --> 01:21:02.832]  And where is that?
[01:21:02.852 --> 01:21:03.933]  It's in front of the Capitol, correct?
[01:21:05.054 --> 01:21:09.056]  Yeah, I think it's Section 7, but I'll give you the information.
[01:21:09.076 --> 01:21:12.339]  But yeah, it's not far from the Supreme Court.
[01:21:13.508 --> 01:21:15.749]  Um, yeah, I'm so thankful.
[01:21:15.809 --> 01:21:18.190]  We have at least 10 nurses that are flying in.
[01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:19.731]  Two of them are from Canada.
[01:21:19.751 --> 01:21:22.772]  One is coming, um, hopefully from Mexico, around the U.S.
[01:21:22.892 --> 01:21:26.134]  And we're going to just, we're, we're putting it on the line.
[01:21:26.454 --> 01:21:30.376]  Um, there's one that, you know, will be fired if she came, her employer already said it.
[01:21:30.436 --> 01:21:32.277]  So the majority of us have lost our jobs.
[01:21:32.317 --> 01:21:33.257]  So we're like, you know what?
[01:21:33.337 --> 01:21:35.758]  Like, this is how we're going to save humanity and turn things around.
[01:21:35.898 --> 01:21:38.920]  Because if not us, then who, you know, we have to do this.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:39.160]  It's,
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:46.945]  Well, we've got a rooftop area running with all the rest of the big media, and so I definitely want to get you and some of those other nurses to come up and do interviews with us after that.
[01:21:47.345 --> 01:21:50.367]  There's going to be a huge rally, obviously, that kicked off at noon.
[01:21:50.387 --> 01:21:54.229]  And I know the location, but I'm not going to announce that until the president does.
[01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:55.810]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:57.431]  That's going to be done later this afternoon.
[01:21:57.651 --> 01:21:58.912]  There's also going to be a big rally
[01:22:00.926 --> 01:22:06.371]  99% sure I'll be able to announce this later today that's going to be in that same Freedom Square on the 5th.
[01:22:06.391 --> 01:22:12.697]  Because the big votes in the Senate and the big battle that Senator Hawley is going to come out swinging for America.
[01:22:13.298 --> 01:22:16.941]  So it looks like some good stuff is about to happen on January 6th, one of the big last shots here.
[01:22:17.782 --> 01:22:20.745]  And so the 5th is so critical for everybody to get to D.C.
[01:22:21.025 --> 01:22:24.489]  by the afternoon of the 5th and regardless be there
[01:22:25.723 --> 01:22:36.028]  In Freedom Square, and again, that is also 9am over by the Capitol with you guys getting into the dangers of the COVID vaccine side effects and the rest of it.
[01:22:36.088 --> 01:22:38.250]  Do you know the name of the marching event?
[01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:41.091]  I mean, I know that Owen Schroeder was telling me that Big Tree invited us.
[01:22:41.591 --> 01:22:44.753]  I just missed the name of the event or organization.
[01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:47.014]  It is.
[01:22:47.774 --> 01:22:48.295]  I'm sorry.
[01:22:48.535 --> 01:22:52.357]  Yeah, Dell is on the same stage that we are, so it's the same.
[01:22:53.542 --> 01:22:57.047]  One, I'd have to look it up for you, but... It's okay.
[01:22:57.287 --> 01:22:59.870]  Yeah, I just heard 9 a.m.
[01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:02.594]  exposing COVID-19 nurses and folks there.
[01:23:02.614 --> 01:23:04.997]  So I figured it was the same place, same time, same speech.
[01:23:05.037 --> 01:23:06.138]  So that's the same event.
[01:23:06.158 --> 01:23:09.642]  So people just can watch InfoWars and learn as soon as it's all codified.
[01:23:09.662 --> 01:23:10.704]  These things are moving very quickly.
[01:23:11.994 --> 01:23:15.877]  You called me a little bit early today, but we're working on a website.
[01:23:15.917 --> 01:23:22.181]  It's GlobalFrontlineNurses.com, so that should be up and then we'll have more details for location and things like that.
[01:23:22.201 --> 01:23:27.024]  Well, it's like George Washington said, don't wait for orders from headquarters, go to the sound of the guns.
[01:23:27.105 --> 01:23:28.886]  And so you are like Paul Revere out there.
[01:23:29.286 --> 01:23:32.188]  And I'm so glad that you're switching your event from Florida to D.C.
[01:23:32.368 --> 01:23:34.549]  Everyone must converge on D.C.
[01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:35.770]  This is the big one.
[01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:37.992]  We need 5 million people there.
[01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:41.214]  We need events for days, not just on the 5th and 6th.
[01:23:41.314 --> 01:23:43.995]  And I can't wait to shake your hand.
[01:23:44.296 --> 01:23:45.236]  Also, your book.
[01:23:46.097 --> 01:23:46.797]  We should talk about that.
[01:23:46.817 --> 01:23:50.500]  The Undercover Epicenter Nurse with Nurse Erin Olszewski.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.361]  How do people find that as well?
[01:23:52.421 --> 01:23:53.842]  At Nurse Erin on Twitter?
[01:23:55.623 --> 01:23:58.525]  I'm on Parler at Nurse Erin, yeah.
[01:23:59.093 --> 01:24:00.794]  Okay, on your parlor at Nurse Erin.
[01:24:00.854 --> 01:24:01.155]  All right.
[01:24:01.535 --> 01:24:02.316]  Thank you so much.
[01:24:02.696 --> 01:24:04.938]  I'm going to come back and give you five minutes.
[01:24:04.958 --> 01:24:05.958]  Give me the floor for five minutes.
[01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:12.123]  Nurse Erin Olszewski is here for another five minutes, and I'm going to give her the floor.
[01:24:13.103 --> 01:24:18.067]  Just kind of recap what's coming up, the name of the event in DC on the 6th at 9 a.m.
[01:24:18.087 --> 01:24:19.628]  in front of the Capitol, and more.
[01:24:19.668 --> 01:24:22.070]  Then I'm going to come back and break down the latest developments.
[01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:23.992]  A lot of big things are going on.
[01:24:24.032 --> 01:24:25.273]  A lot of big things are happening.
[01:24:25.813 --> 01:24:30.737]  I'm dealing right now with the big rally on the 6th, making decisions that must be made right now.
[01:24:30.757 --> 01:24:32.538]  So I'm going to let her take over for four minutes.
[01:24:32.558 --> 01:24:32.959]  Here she is.
[01:24:34.636 --> 01:24:35.076]  Thank you.
[01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:46.843]  So yeah, the website for the Freedom Rally in general to see who's all speaking at our event is freedomrally2021.com.
[01:24:48.124 --> 01:24:59.590]  And then for more specifics, I guess, once Alex caught me in the middle, so I'm not quite done with our website, but it will be globalfrontlinenurses.com.
[01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:01.151]  So you can read about the nurses,
[01:25:02.729 --> 01:25:10.212]  And, you know, donate if possible, because most of us are, have been fired from our jobs for speaking out and telling the truth.
[01:25:10.372 --> 01:25:14.834]  And, um, you know, coming there is, it's, it's a travel.
[01:25:15.054 --> 01:25:29.640]  It's a, it's, it's expensive to, to do that, but we all feel that if we don't do that and do this and speak out and tell the truth, then we're, we're, our world is, is not going to be in a good place.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.320]  And the,
[01:25:31.223 --> 01:25:37.546]  The job of a nurse is to care for our patients and make sure that we do no harm.
[01:25:39.107 --> 01:25:42.889]  There's harm being done right now to people and it's hard.
[01:25:43.129 --> 01:25:47.711]  It's hard to look at what's happening in our world and stay quiet.
[01:25:50.453 --> 01:25:57.436]  Since I've come out, there's been a lot more nurses that have contacted me and they see it happening all over the world right now.
[01:25:59.392 --> 01:26:07.077]  What's been happening over the past year almost, you know, has kind of all brought us to where we are today.
[01:26:07.338 --> 01:26:10.400]  So we're in the biggest fight for our lives.
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:17.084]  And I think that this event in Washington is probably going to be one of the most important days in history.
[01:26:17.465 --> 01:26:24.589]  And to be a part of that is, I'm humbled to be a part of it and stand on the right side of history.
[01:26:25.871 --> 01:26:41.695]  I really do hope that we can open some eyes and with all these nurses coming out, we can shift the healthcare system that we have into one that's made to help people and not to hurt people.
[01:26:42.015 --> 01:26:47.756]  And hopefully, being a whistleblower, we could have more protection.
[01:26:48.196 --> 01:26:53.478]  I think that's one of the biggest things right now is people are afraid because they get fired.
[01:26:56.339 --> 01:26:57.780]  Your whole entire life changes.
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.521]  And I'm just a mom.
[01:27:01.822 --> 01:27:02.483]  I'm a mom.
[01:27:02.543 --> 01:27:03.704]  I was a nurse.
[01:27:03.804 --> 01:27:09.588]  I was happy living my life trying to do the best I can to help my patients.
[01:27:10.028 --> 01:27:15.372]  And this has now been my focus because I'm terrified of what's going to happen.
[01:27:17.034 --> 01:27:22.178]  When I'm no longer here to fight for my kids, you know, what I don't, that's why I'm here.
[01:27:22.418 --> 01:27:44.215]  You know, I don't want them to grow up in a world that is unrecognizable and that they have to fight, you know, for their lives or, you know, live in, you know, something that is just completely unrecognizable and, you know, being, um, you know, in the military and fighting overseas, I was in Iraq for a little over a year.
[01:27:44.235 --> 01:27:44.275]  Um,
[01:27:46.974 --> 01:27:48.455]  That fight's still in me, you know?
[01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:49.736]  Now my boots are on the ground here.
[01:27:49.956 --> 01:27:53.219]  So, um, against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:27:53.259 --> 01:27:58.083]  So this, this right here is a domestic war and, um, I'm, I'm here to fight it.
[01:27:58.563 --> 01:28:13.356]  Um, they, I guess they, they probably didn't expect people like me and people, you know, other people that are speaking out, um, you know, we're, we're kind of throwing a wrench in, in their game plan and that's exactly what, what I intend to continue doing.
[01:28:13.376 --> 01:28:13.416]  So.
[01:28:15.398 --> 01:28:24.084]  I just am very grateful for the opportunity to use my voice, and as long as I can speak, I'm going to keep on talking and telling the truth.
[01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:27.827]  Alright, well Nurse Erin Olszewski, we love you, we appreciate you.
[01:28:27.887 --> 01:28:29.468]  You're on Parlor at Nurse Erin.
[01:28:29.508 --> 01:28:32.630]  You can also find us on Parlor at InfoWars.
[01:28:33.111 --> 01:28:35.632]  And we really look forward to seeing you guys out there.
[01:28:35.652 --> 01:28:38.394]  A lot of big rallies coming up on the 5th and 6th.
[01:28:39.355 --> 01:28:40.796]  The 5th is just as important as the 6th.
[01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:43.098]  We need a huge showing on the 5th.
[01:28:43.138 --> 01:28:44.960]  I can tell you that's directly from Trump.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:46.381]  That's all I'm going to say.
[01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:48.263]  I've literally been on the phone.
[01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:50.545]  I'm just going to leave it at that so it's not a national issue.
[01:28:50.965 --> 01:28:53.927]  But this big announcement is about to be made today by Trump about the 6th.
[01:28:54.228 --> 01:28:55.289]  Thank you, Nurse Erin.
[01:28:55.709 --> 01:28:56.369]  Welcome back.
[01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:58.111]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:28:58.151 --> 01:29:02.415]  And I've got big international news that I could break right now on air.
[01:29:03.553 --> 01:29:09.017]  About Trump and the rally on the 6th and all the inside baseball that is extremely important.
[01:29:09.438 --> 01:29:10.278]  It's very, very pertinent.
[01:29:11.299 --> 01:29:14.442]  But I'm not sure I'm going to scoop the president.
[01:29:15.322 --> 01:29:22.828]  But at a certain point, I kind of need to just because I want people to understand the big picture and what's really going on.
[01:29:22.848 --> 01:29:24.549]  But I'm not ready to talk about it right now.
[01:29:24.569 --> 01:29:28.873]  I'm not ready to talk about it just this second.
[01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:35.136]  I'm having to think about this a little bit.
[01:29:35.156 --> 01:29:39.238]  I'm going to think about this a little bit more, but there's a reason I have that nice nurse.
[01:29:40.079 --> 01:29:48.443]  Like, hey, you go ahead and host a segment or so, or hey, I'm not going to be at the microphone for a minute because this stuff is all moving so incredibly quick.
[01:29:49.284 --> 01:29:55.608]  And the good news is, I'll just leave it at that, Mike Pence just announced he was going to be in Israel on the 6th.
[01:29:56.929 --> 01:30:02.053]  So he could dodge overseeing the debate about challenging the election and the electors.
[01:30:02.554 --> 01:30:05.496]  He just canceled going to Israel on the 6th.
[01:30:06.497 --> 01:30:13.023]  Daily Beast reports Pence cancels his post-election Florida vacation and his trip to Israel.
[01:30:13.043 --> 01:30:15.465]  He'll now be in Washington, D.C.
[01:30:17.747 --> 01:30:19.848]  So that's just some of what we're about to be breaking down.
[01:30:19.888 --> 01:30:23.131]  VP Pence's final visit to Israel is canceled.
[01:30:23.592 --> 01:30:25.093]  Here is the report.
[01:30:27.927 --> 01:30:43.033]  So, there is a real chance, a real chance, that you're going to see a new election called for in those five states, and that's where everything's angling.
[01:30:43.753 --> 01:30:49.375]  I'll make a statement on this at the start of the next hour before the next host takes over.
[01:30:50.996 --> 01:30:52.457]  And I'm going to decide how much I'm going to say.
[01:30:53.556 --> 01:30:55.957]  The President may announce a bunch of this before I even get to it.
[01:30:56.718 --> 01:31:00.960]  But when the President makes the announcement, I want you to have the rest of the backstory on this.
[01:31:01.461 --> 01:31:03.122]  Alright, Andrew Tate's a good friend of mine.
[01:31:03.142 --> 01:31:03.882]  He's a great guy.
[01:31:05.183 --> 01:31:07.004]  He's a world champion kickboxer.
[01:31:07.024 --> 01:31:13.188]  His brother's a top boxer as well, an MMA guy, kickboxer.
[01:31:13.688 --> 01:31:16.870]  And his dad is a former world champion chess player.
[01:31:18.228 --> 01:31:23.853]  Emory Andrew Tate III is an American-British cruiserweight kickboxer, mixed martial artist, businessman, sports commentator, and vlogger.
[01:31:24.433 --> 01:31:29.157]  As a kickboxer, Tate is a three-time ISKA World Champion and Infusion Champion.
[01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:33.401]  Born in Washington, D.C., he fought out of London, England until his retirement.
[01:31:34.041 --> 01:31:40.286]  Tate made his return February 2020 at KO Master 7 in Bucharest, Romania, where he currently resides.
[01:31:41.087 --> 01:31:42.028]  CobraTate.com.
[01:31:42.388 --> 01:31:44.370]  And I wanted to get him on
[01:31:45.930 --> 01:32:00.145]  To give his view, living in the US, living in England, living in Eastern Europe, between those places, the COVID lockdown, the world government, what's happening to Trump, where he sees this going, how he would categorize this time in history, because he's a smart guy, and I respect his opinion.
[01:32:00.825 --> 01:32:02.948]  But now you've got all these other big developments happening.
[01:32:03.548 --> 01:32:04.749]  Tate, it's great to have you back with us.
[01:32:04.789 --> 01:32:05.971]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:32:07.557 --> 01:32:08.097]  Hello, sir.
[01:32:08.157 --> 01:32:10.018]  Good to see you again, always.
[01:32:10.319 --> 01:32:10.739]  Good to see you.
[01:32:10.759 --> 01:32:12.660]  I think that absolutely everything is linked.
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:14.081]  Absolutely everything is linked.
[01:32:14.641 --> 01:32:24.487]  And for me, the most pertinent issue, and I know it's been widely discussed, but it absolutely has to be this scam safety coronavirus
[01:32:25.345 --> 01:32:35.130]  This big, I don't want to swear on live television, but I think you know the word I'm looking for, all in the name of safety, they're trying to dehumanize us and enslave us.
[01:32:35.551 --> 01:32:42.374]  And they're trying to remove any element of masculinity left amongst the population so that we accept all of their fallacies.
[01:32:42.834 --> 01:32:44.695]  And that's what I believe coronavirus is.
[01:32:45.376 --> 01:32:47.337]  And it's extremely upsetting for me to witness.
[01:32:47.377 --> 01:32:50.779]  And it's extremely upsetting for me to see how successful they've been.
[01:32:51.619 --> 01:32:52.880]  This is what upsets me the most.
[01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:58.159]  I can't believe how successful they've been with a 99% survival rate.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.604]  People are walking around with their faces muzzled.
[01:33:00.965 --> 01:33:02.247]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:33:04.867 --> 01:33:05.648]  I totally agree.
[01:33:05.708 --> 01:33:10.232]  This has been a major Chicken Little meets Salem Witch Trial success.
[01:33:11.193 --> 01:33:18.799]  We know that they psychologically tested it at Stanford and other universities for decades before they rolled out their plan, and they even admit it's a plan.
[01:33:18.839 --> 01:33:24.004]  They even admit it's a great reset, which is even worse that they're so confident they're rubbing it in, Andrew.
[01:33:25.549 --> 01:33:27.771]  Yeah, because you have to understand this.
[01:33:27.851 --> 01:33:30.973]  It's always been the men of society which have resisted.
[01:33:31.434 --> 01:33:33.315]  This is our job as men is to resist.
[01:33:33.735 --> 01:33:41.822]  So when they try and demasculinize us and feminize us, it's done very, very specifically so that we will not revolt in the face of obvious tyranny.
[01:33:42.442 --> 01:33:57.259]  They tried for a very long time to turn men into women, or to demasculinize men, and then they come along with a 99% survival rate virus, and command everyone to cover their faces, quit their jobs, lose their incomes, sit at home like cowards!
[01:33:57.859 --> 01:34:00.160]  And people have absolutely and utterly complied.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:03.961]  I had very little faith in the sheep people.
[01:34:04.001 --> 01:34:09.662]  But before COVID, I now understand how Nazi Germany committed all the atrocities.
[01:34:09.722 --> 01:34:11.203]  Everything starts to make sense to me now.
[01:34:11.683 --> 01:34:14.784]  There is no reason for a full grown man to be afraid of anything.
[01:34:15.084 --> 01:34:21.565]  And they are still muzzling themselves and sacrificing their financial freedom for a 99.9% survival rate.
[01:34:21.886 --> 01:34:23.286]  It's more dangerous to get in a car.
[01:34:23.946 --> 01:34:25.427]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:34:25.487 --> 01:34:28.748]  I've lost faith in the men of society to resist this.
[01:34:29.668 --> 01:34:36.371]  I do not understand why- And by the way, when you talk to him and you say, all you need is vitamin D- It's been nearly a year!
[01:34:37.325 --> 01:34:38.006]  I totally agree.
[01:34:38.086 --> 01:34:44.190]  And when you say to them, all you need is vitamin D3C, all you need is exercise, and then it's not even 99.999.
[01:34:45.811 --> 01:34:47.072]  It's basically impossible to get it.
[01:34:47.432 --> 01:34:50.394]  They don't want to hear it because they want to act like they're virtue signalers.
[01:34:50.674 --> 01:34:51.935]  It's about being posers.
[01:34:52.215 --> 01:34:53.436]  It's about going along.
[01:34:53.696 --> 01:34:57.459]  They don't get that that's what makes you a slave and makes the predators come.
[01:34:57.679 --> 01:35:02.182]  They think submitting gets them ahead, but they're all about to find out that's not the case.
[01:35:02.222 --> 01:35:06.284]  What do you expect to happen when it dawns on them that the lockdown causes a global depression?
[01:35:07.205 --> 01:35:09.787]  Absolutely.
[01:35:09.807 --> 01:35:10.607]  You're completely correct.
[01:35:10.868 --> 01:35:14.030]  And they think by being completely submissive, they're going to somehow help.
[01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:18.633]  Oh, if I'm completely submissive, then my master one day will be a little bit nice to me.
[01:35:18.933 --> 01:35:19.794]  Let me tell you something.
[01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:23.416]  This crap doesn't end until people stop accepting it.
[01:35:23.757 --> 01:35:26.979]  And the countries where people have stopped accepting this garbage
[01:35:27.419 --> 01:35:33.661]  It's ended, and in the places where people continue to comply with these ridiculous rules, the rules remain.
[01:35:34.081 --> 01:35:45.144]  Until people stand up and say, listen, I'm an adult, and I'm responsible for my safety, and I will not give all of my freedom away in the name of safety for a government which doesn't care about me anyway.
[01:35:45.464 --> 01:35:48.425]  Until people do something about this, it is never going to stop.
[01:35:48.845 --> 01:35:51.026]  We are human beings and life carries risk.
[01:35:51.386 --> 01:35:52.786]  Virus will never disappear.
[01:35:53.127 --> 01:35:54.567]  COVID is going to be here forever.
[01:35:55.087 --> 01:35:59.069]  There's going to have to become a day we take our masks off and live our lives.
[01:35:59.529 --> 01:36:00.749]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:02.010]  This is a test.
[01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:06.151]  For a long time, they tried to feminize men and remove our fight in spirit.
[01:36:06.391 --> 01:36:09.653]  And they came along with this obvious, they did it very purposely.
[01:36:09.873 --> 01:36:12.114]  They made it very clear that the survival rate is high.
[01:36:12.394 --> 01:36:17.036]  They were made it very, very obvious that you are not, you are safe to take your mask off and go outside.
[01:36:17.396 --> 01:36:19.477]  And they want to see you comply regardless.
[01:36:19.797 --> 01:36:20.517]  This is a test.
[01:36:20.897 --> 01:36:24.059]  And until people stand up and do something about this, it's never going to stop!
[01:36:50.797 --> 01:36:51.678]  It's never going to end.
[01:36:52.298 --> 01:36:53.278]  And Andrew, you're absolutely right.
[01:36:53.339 --> 01:36:54.759]  They admit it's never going to end.
[01:36:55.079 --> 01:36:57.621]  They admit it's to destroy the economy, to vertically integrate.
[01:36:57.661 --> 01:37:00.423]  They admit big tech and the big banks have doubled their profits.
[01:37:00.703 --> 01:37:04.725]  They admit it's a cold-blooded move to make more people poor permanently to control them.
[01:37:04.745 --> 01:37:06.526]  And then they say it's for your own good.
[01:37:06.806 --> 01:37:08.847]  It's so disgusting and sick.
[01:37:09.087 --> 01:37:14.470]  And then we watch all these men, and you see two-to-one women complying, loving the servitude.
[01:37:15.051 --> 01:37:18.673]  We've already gone under something worse than radical Islamic control.
[01:37:20.237 --> 01:37:21.357]  Absolutely this is worse.
[01:37:21.897 --> 01:37:23.358]  This is absolutely insane.
[01:37:23.618 --> 01:37:27.279]  This is one of the largest mass slavery exercises in history.
[01:37:27.739 --> 01:37:29.839]  What's happening now is nearly unprecedented.
[01:37:30.139 --> 01:37:33.420]  You're going to come along to citizens and lock them in their houses?
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.120]  You demand their taxes.
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:36.461]  You demand they work.
[01:37:36.681 --> 01:37:38.161]  You take all their money from them anyway.
[01:37:38.181 --> 01:37:40.662]  Now you're going to lock them in their house and not allow them to leave?
[01:37:40.682 --> 01:37:42.402]  I thought, where's the freedom?
[01:37:42.942 --> 01:37:44.122]  There's zero freedom left.
[01:37:44.382 --> 01:37:47.243]  They're attempting to replace freedom with safety.
[01:37:47.503 --> 01:37:48.544]  This is what they want to do.
[01:37:48.824 --> 01:37:51.485]  Because of men like you, Alex, you're telling the truth.
[01:37:51.825 --> 01:37:54.526]  They tried to censor the truth, and it wasn't working.
[01:37:54.786 --> 01:37:56.646]  People like you and me are getting the message out.
[01:37:56.706 --> 01:37:58.727]  So they said, okay, too many people are waking up.
[01:37:58.987 --> 01:38:06.349]  So let's take all of their freedom away, and let's tell them they're not safe unless they completely comply and throw all of their freedom out the window.
[01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:08.470]  Because they don't want people thinking for themselves.
[01:38:08.590 --> 01:38:08.950]  That's right.
[01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:11.250]  Stay at home, be afraid.
[01:38:11.530 --> 01:38:12.571]  That's all they want of us.
[01:38:12.591 --> 01:38:13.071]  They want slaves.
[01:38:13.091 --> 01:38:23.593]  That's right, we gotta go to break, but the police... Bow down to Black Lives Matter burning down buildings, but then if you try to not wear a mask in San Antonio, the police brutally attack you because they've been told to go out and do it.
[01:38:23.813 --> 01:38:25.993]  It's disgusting, and they're idiots, and it's wrong.
[01:38:26.313 --> 01:38:31.174]  We have from CobraTate.com, Andrew Tate, a really fired up fella on the other side.
[01:38:31.194 --> 01:38:31.775]  We'll be right back.
[01:38:31.795 --> 01:38:32.215]  Stay with us.
[01:38:32.475 --> 01:38:33.015]  Welcome back.
[01:38:33.155 --> 01:38:36.596]  Andrew Tate of CobraTate.com is our guest.
[01:38:36.676 --> 01:38:38.416]  He is world champion kickboxer.
[01:38:39.136 --> 01:38:42.137]  He's also a successful businessman, and he's a smart guy.
[01:38:42.357 --> 01:38:43.378]  His brother's also really smart.
[01:38:43.398 --> 01:38:44.278]  Had a lot of fun with him.
[01:38:44.598 --> 01:38:47.460]  Hardly was already last Christmas around this time.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:48.360]  They were actually here in Texas.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:53.642]  We got dinner down at a nice steakhouse back when we weren't wearing masks and we were still quasi-free.
[01:38:54.003 --> 01:38:57.104]  This is a globalist revolution against humanity, against men.
[01:38:57.504 --> 01:38:58.104]  They admit it.
[01:38:58.685 --> 01:39:01.986]  They're letting men into women's sports, saying that they are women.
[01:39:02.566 --> 01:39:03.967]  This is a biological attack.
[01:39:04.007 --> 01:39:08.129]  They admit it is, and it's so egregious, it's so criminal, and it's really a
[01:39:09.815 --> 01:39:14.878]  Total assault, a full spectrum move by the corporations to domesticate humanity.
[01:39:14.938 --> 01:39:15.618]  That's what it is.
[01:39:16.499 --> 01:39:18.380]  The Carnegie Foundation after World War II was...
[01:39:19.724 --> 01:39:19.904]  Yes.
[01:39:50.805 --> 01:39:51.665]  Absolutely correct.
[01:39:52.045 --> 01:39:55.347]  And we have to do the best we can to simply not comply.
[01:39:55.888 --> 01:40:00.791]  Since this lockdown garbage has started, since this coronavirus has started, I've been to 13 countries.
[01:40:01.191 --> 01:40:02.512]  I refuse to put a mask on.
[01:40:02.952 --> 01:40:04.993]  If someone says I'm going to call the police, say, okay, call the police.
[01:40:05.393 --> 01:40:06.534]  And I don't want to get arrested.
[01:40:06.554 --> 01:40:07.795]  I don't want to fight with anybody.
[01:40:08.195 --> 01:40:13.378]  So if the police come and they say, you must put on a mask, I'll say, okay, I'll put it on for 10 seconds.
[01:40:13.398 --> 01:40:14.899]  And when they walk off, I'll take it off again.
[01:40:15.439 --> 01:40:21.127]  If everybody made it so difficult for them to enforce these rules that the rules had no weight, it would end overnight.
[01:40:21.607 --> 01:40:26.293]  I will not put a mask on unless you get police officers to the venue and force me.
[01:40:26.614 --> 01:40:29.617]  Then I will put it on, and the second they leave, I will take it off.
[01:40:30.158 --> 01:40:32.962]  And I will continue to do that, and if everyone did that, this shit would end.
[01:40:33.602 --> 01:40:35.243]  People are complying too easily.
[01:40:35.583 --> 01:40:38.284]  And the reason people are complying is not because they're scared of the virus.
[01:40:38.605 --> 01:40:41.566]  I say to people in their masks, do you wear a mask at home?
[01:40:42.086 --> 01:40:44.667]  Do you wear a mask where you're allowed to not wear a mask?
[01:40:45.048 --> 01:40:46.728]  No, you're not afraid of Corona.
[01:40:47.009 --> 01:40:48.830]  You're afraid of not complying.
[01:40:49.230 --> 01:40:50.690]  That shows your cowardice.
[01:40:51.191 --> 01:40:55.433]  You cannot comply with something you know to be false purely out of fear.
[01:40:55.673 --> 01:40:57.914]  That is not the masculine attitude towards life.
[01:40:58.522 --> 01:41:04.383]  This whole mask escapade is a mark of submission.
[01:41:04.703 --> 01:41:07.524]  When you want someone to be submissive, you humiliate them.
[01:41:07.904 --> 01:41:17.946]  Making you wear a mask when you go for a piss in a bathroom, but allowing you to take it off to drink, laugh, and kiss whoever's next to you has nothing to do with medical science.
[01:41:18.626 --> 01:41:20.106]  It's a humiliation tactic.
[01:41:20.386 --> 01:41:22.107]  Because if you're humiliated, you're submissive.
[01:41:22.427 --> 01:41:26.688]  And the people who are in charge of the world don't want to hide what they're doing anymore.
[01:41:27.008 --> 01:41:28.108]  They can't hide it, Alex.
[01:41:28.723 --> 01:41:29.884]  There's people like you out there.
[01:41:30.085 --> 01:41:31.246]  There's other people on the Internet.
[01:41:31.526 --> 01:41:32.847]  All of their secrets are coming out.
[01:41:33.128 --> 01:41:33.949]  They can't hide it.
[01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:35.590]  They killed Epstein in our face.
[01:41:35.851 --> 01:41:37.613]  They rigged the election in our face.
[01:41:37.853 --> 01:41:39.274]  They no longer want to hide it.
[01:41:39.515 --> 01:41:41.837]  Their new tactic is we won't hide anything.
[01:41:42.137 --> 01:41:45.381]  We'll just do it right in their face and they won't do anything about it.
[01:41:45.681 --> 01:41:47.003]  And that's what this whole Corona
[01:41:47.763 --> 01:41:49.465]  Exercise is linked to.
[01:41:49.745 --> 01:41:50.666]  That's what all of this is.
[01:41:50.706 --> 01:41:57.133]  They want to just continue to do whatever they want, blatantly, in broad daylight, and everyone be too afraid to do anything about it.
[01:41:57.173 --> 01:41:58.855]  That's their master plan.
[01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:09.596]  And again, people think it's a throwback to see aggressive men that are loud and angry, and I've met you and your brother, you're really big and posing guys, but that's a good thing.
[01:42:09.636 --> 01:42:13.379]  That makes me feel secure that humanity's strong and aggressive and smart.
[01:42:13.819 --> 01:42:17.982]  And these globalist nerds always associate big and strong with dumb.
[01:42:18.022 --> 01:42:19.543]  That's actually not even how it works.
[01:42:19.943 --> 01:42:21.885]  And it's up to those of us that are not.
[01:42:22.825 --> 01:42:27.869]  Modern, domesticated, soft people, and who are more caveman-like, which is the stronger attributes.
[01:42:27.889 --> 01:42:29.290]  We're getting weaker, not stronger.
[01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:38.416]  All the studies show they dig up people in Africa, they dig up people from England 5-10,000 years ago, and the average farmer was stronger than, you know, a top Olympic athlete.
[01:42:38.856 --> 01:42:40.157]  We are all degenerating.
[01:42:40.177 --> 01:42:41.778]  We need to get back to what we were.
[01:42:41.998 --> 01:42:43.079]  We were more intelligent.
[01:42:43.279 --> 01:42:44.040]  We lived longer.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.121]  If you survived past being a baby.
[01:42:47.682 --> 01:42:55.875]  I mean, there's so much going on here, we must rediscover our humanity, celebrate humanity, and that will defeat this post-human world the big corporations are building.
[01:42:57.230 --> 01:42:57.730]  Absolutely.
[01:42:58.071 --> 01:43:00.893]  It's absolutely no mistake and it's completely by design.
[01:43:00.933 --> 01:43:02.274]  They tell men don't be strong.
[01:43:02.334 --> 01:43:03.034]  Don't be loud.
[01:43:03.074 --> 01:43:03.895]  Don't have an opinion.
[01:43:03.935 --> 01:43:04.736]  Don't be aggressive.
[01:43:05.056 --> 01:43:06.257]  Just put the mask on.
[01:43:06.537 --> 01:43:07.417]  Just stay at home.
[01:43:07.718 --> 01:43:09.199]  Just throw your business away.
[01:43:09.479 --> 01:43:10.620]  Don't think for yourself.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:11.901]  Just comply.
[01:43:12.201 --> 01:43:13.142]  I will keep you safe.
[01:43:13.202 --> 01:43:14.182]  You don't need freedom.
[01:43:14.403 --> 01:43:15.343]  You need safety.
[01:43:15.563 --> 01:43:17.585]  You're only safe if you listen to me.
[01:43:17.825 --> 01:43:19.006]  You don't need an income.
[01:43:19.266 --> 01:43:20.867]  You know what the best stimulus check is?
[01:43:21.288 --> 01:43:21.808]  A job.
[01:43:22.208 --> 01:43:23.529]  That's what the best stimulus check is.
[01:43:23.889 --> 01:43:24.510]  You know what the best
[01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:26.271]  Safety is for humanity.
[01:43:26.591 --> 01:43:28.252]  People out there doing what they need to do.
[01:43:28.532 --> 01:43:31.333]  If they really cared about humanity, why haven't they built any new hospitals?
[01:43:31.654 --> 01:43:38.537]  Why didn't they keep all the businesses open, ask for $50 a week from each one and build 200 new hospitals?
[01:43:38.817 --> 01:43:42.159]  We can have hospitals all over the world for the cost of this economic downturn.
[01:43:42.539 --> 01:43:44.100]  They don't care about us.
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:45.340]  They don't care.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:51.242]  They want slaves who are afraid, who comply, who give away all of their money on demand.
[01:43:51.523 --> 01:43:53.603]  That's all they want, it's all they ever wanted.
[01:43:53.623 --> 01:43:58.425]  Because if you're in charge of the world, the only thing you enjoy is control.
[01:43:58.665 --> 01:44:02.246]  You're above money, you're above sports cars, you're above fancy boats.
[01:44:02.526 --> 01:44:06.048]  The only way you can get any kind of buzz in your life is control.
[01:44:06.268 --> 01:44:08.549]  That's right, and these are from inbred, multi...
[01:44:10.356 --> 01:44:28.853]  And they're from inbred, multi-generational families that are so unhappy on average, their only happiness is making us miserable because they see a big, vibrant middle class out on their powerboats with their hot wives, their healthy children, and the David Rockefellers and Bill Gateses of the world and Prince Charles of the world get pissed about that!
[01:44:29.073 --> 01:44:33.096]  And they enjoy trying to have us under their stinking pedophile thumbs!
[01:44:34.264 --> 01:44:34.724]  Completely.
[01:44:34.764 --> 01:44:35.645]  They don't want us happy.
[01:44:35.965 --> 01:44:37.847]  Why would they want us to be happy when they are miserable?
[01:44:38.187 --> 01:44:39.368]  That's the last thing they want.
[01:44:39.768 --> 01:44:42.610]  They want us in perpetual slavery.
[01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:43.851]  That's all they want.
[01:44:44.151 --> 01:44:45.612]  And think of the ego trip.
[01:44:45.892 --> 01:44:56.460]  If you have a control problem, if you're a power freak, if you're a control freak, imagine the ego trip of saying to somebody, there's a 99% survival rate, but you will give up your business.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:57.921]  You will go bankrupt.
[01:44:58.201 --> 01:45:00.402]  You will stay in your house and you will not leave.
[01:45:00.763 --> 01:45:03.705]  And if you do want to leave, you'll take a random injection.
[01:45:03.985 --> 01:45:10.089]  That nobody knows the effects of, and they're going to allow us to inject you anyway, even though you do not need it.
[01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:11.811]  That is a power trip.
[01:45:12.171 --> 01:45:12.992]  That's all that is.
[01:45:13.032 --> 01:45:18.976]  It's a power trip for people who are control freaks, because all these people who are in charge of the world enjoy one thing only, control.
[01:45:19.296 --> 01:45:21.798]  And that's why they're so overt with what they do.
[01:45:22.058 --> 01:45:24.440]  They didn't try and hide this stealing this election.
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:25.621]  They haven't tried to hide any of it.
[01:45:25.901 --> 01:45:27.182]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:45:27.522 --> 01:45:29.624]  They know exactly what they're doing, and they're loving every second of it.
[01:45:30.024 --> 01:45:31.245]  It's an absolute travesty.
[01:45:32.517 --> 01:45:34.458]  Well, the good news is, we'll play this clip when we come back.
[01:45:35.898 --> 01:45:45.081]  From California to Texas to New York to Ohio, people are going to malls, they're going to grocery stores, they're going to Costco's en masse, and they're not wearing masks, and they're educating people.
[01:45:45.121 --> 01:45:48.382]  In most places, the cops are nice, do their job, and don't violate rights.
[01:45:48.402 --> 01:45:51.763]  But in San Antonio, they arrested a Marine Corps decorated veteran.
[01:45:51.803 --> 01:45:52.823]  We'll play the clip next segment.
[01:45:53.905 --> 01:45:58.810]  For simply going to the mall to educate people that the masks are never coming off until you take them off.
[01:45:59.071 --> 01:46:00.993]  Bill Gates has said they're never coming off!
[01:46:01.253 --> 01:46:02.635]  My God, this is insane!
[01:46:04.907 --> 01:46:06.188]  This is what I don't understand.
[01:46:06.828 --> 01:46:11.210]  Tell me when this virus, COVID-19, is due to disappear.
[01:46:11.551 --> 01:46:15.212]  Because if it's going to be here forever, does that mean we wear masks forever?
[01:46:15.633 --> 01:46:19.715]  Or will a day come when the virus exists and we no longer need masks?
[01:46:20.115 --> 01:46:21.416]  There's no reason to put the masks on.
[01:46:21.436 --> 01:46:24.417]  I'll tell you what's coming next and I think you- We don't wear them.
[01:46:24.838 --> 01:46:27.239]  It doesn't make sense in any other logical universe.
[01:46:27.719 --> 01:46:29.020]  All right, well, you're on fire, my friend.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:30.841]  We got to get you back up more often than once a year.
[01:46:31.201 --> 01:46:35.344]  They started rerunning an old ad you were nice enough to cut for us live on air the other day.
[01:46:35.364 --> 01:46:36.785]  And I said, we got to get Tate on.
[01:46:36.845 --> 01:46:39.667]  I bet he is super pissed and also follow some of your stuff.
[01:46:39.687 --> 01:46:41.468]  So you got to come on at least once a month.
[01:46:41.488 --> 01:46:42.909]  We got to get you back over here to the US.
[01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:44.610]  I'm trying to get Paul out of the UK.
[01:46:44.690 --> 01:46:46.031]  He's literally under martial law.
[01:46:46.331 --> 01:46:47.072]  Everything's closed.
[01:46:47.452 --> 01:46:49.394]  And I told him a year ago, I said, get out of there.
[01:46:49.774 --> 01:46:52.035]  It's going into martial law before COVID even popped up.
[01:46:52.075 --> 01:46:52.996]  I've got all the documents.
[01:46:53.296 --> 01:46:54.397]  I'll tell you where it's going.
[01:46:54.417 --> 01:46:55.758]  And I want to get your take on what we should do.
[01:46:56.178 --> 01:46:57.059]  Andrew Tate, stay with us.
[01:46:57.079 --> 01:46:57.559]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.961]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:47:01.541 --> 01:47:04.703]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and Andrew Tate is riding shotgun with us.
[01:47:05.444 --> 01:47:08.606]  When he leaves us, I'm going to tell you what's coming up in D.C.
[01:47:09.166 --> 01:47:14.990]  You notice I had to go to rebroadcast the first five minutes of the hour, or had a guest host, because I had to talk to some folks.
[01:47:15.630 --> 01:47:21.234]  I went live at six after, and I said I would expect the president any minute to announce he is speaking.
[01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:25.112]  At the event on the 6th.
[01:47:25.813 --> 01:47:28.415]  And you notice right at that second, he tweeted that out.
[01:47:29.175 --> 01:47:32.458]  So I'll tell you next hour why they were waiting to pull the trigger.
[01:47:33.792 --> 01:47:36.694]  Until they had made a few phone calls.
[01:47:36.814 --> 01:47:37.775]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:47:38.176 --> 01:47:41.558]  But the media is really going to have a major heart attack over this, I can tell you.
[01:47:42.419 --> 01:47:43.320]  I can guarantee you.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.681]  Because there's a lot of stuff coming up in D.C.
[01:47:45.701 --> 01:47:47.543]  on the 5th and 6th that I'm privy to.
[01:47:48.343 --> 01:47:52.267]  And it's really all just because I paid for the stages, part of the stages and the permits.
[01:47:52.887 --> 01:47:58.030]  And then I went ahead and just handed those over to the White House so it can be their deal.
[01:47:58.050 --> 01:47:59.390]  Because we knew we had to get it.
[01:47:59.410 --> 01:48:00.231]  We knew we had to pay for it.
[01:48:00.251 --> 01:48:02.132]  We knew we had to do it because nobody else would.
[01:48:02.312 --> 01:48:03.793]  And boom, in comes the president.
[01:48:04.193 --> 01:48:08.375]  So I hand the ball off and I'm not in control of it.
[01:48:08.855 --> 01:48:09.415]  And that's great.
[01:48:10.416 --> 01:48:15.719]  And so I'll tell you what is coming up next hour and with the big events.
[01:48:15.819 --> 01:48:16.979]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:48:17.039 --> 01:48:17.920]  This is going to be historic.
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:20.701]  You are going to want to get to D.C.
[01:48:21.121 --> 01:48:22.022]  on the 5th and the 6th.
[01:48:24.104 --> 01:48:27.387]  But I only came on air and told you, you'll see the President announce this anytime.
[01:48:28.148 --> 01:48:29.309]  And then of course, he did.
[01:48:29.329 --> 01:48:31.891]  And you'll see more of that happening.
[01:48:31.911 --> 01:48:38.337]  So he announced it literally one minute after I said that that was the case, just to give our enemies a little bit of heartburn there.
[01:48:39.818 --> 01:48:41.480]  Okay, going back to Andrew Tate.
[01:48:43.113 --> 01:48:49.157]  Here is a clip of a Marine Corps veteran who was on the show with Owen Schroyer just yesterday.
[01:48:49.177 --> 01:48:55.441]  This weekend they went in to, or I guess Monday, they went into a mall in San Antonio.
[01:48:56.021 --> 01:48:58.242]  And boy, they were Black Lives Matter, shooting people and burning stuff.
[01:48:58.262 --> 01:49:03.225]  It would have been fun if there were a bunch of white kids standing there representing black people working for Soros or they'd burn down a police station.
[01:49:03.245 --> 01:49:03.866]  That would have been great.
[01:49:04.226 --> 01:49:07.411]  But they didn't wear their masks, so the cops tackled them because they're good little heroes.
[01:49:07.671 --> 01:49:10.215]  The cops are wearing their little burkas, following their orders.
[01:49:10.275 --> 01:49:17.106]  This is so disgusting to watch the home of the free land the brave become the home of the neurotic chicken little cowards on their little witch hunt.
[01:49:17.126 --> 01:49:17.466]  Here it is.
[01:49:21.941 --> 01:49:22.561]  Freedom!
[01:49:22.721 --> 01:49:23.802]  Freedom!
[01:49:23.902 --> 01:49:25.723]  Liberty!
[01:49:25.884 --> 01:49:26.624]  Liberty!
[01:49:26.644 --> 01:49:27.325]  Stop!
[01:49:27.505 --> 01:49:28.225]  Stop!
[01:49:28.245 --> 01:49:28.726]  Stop!
[01:49:28.906 --> 01:49:32.448]  That's his wife!
[01:49:33.409 --> 01:49:37.853]  That's his wife!
[01:49:51.650 --> 01:49:52.546]  So that's Eric Bright.
[01:49:54.437 --> 01:49:58.878]  And there are the horrible goon security guards all look like a bunch of fat little lemon.
[01:49:59.398 --> 01:50:01.278]  And you got the cops there doing it just disgraceful.
[01:50:01.298 --> 01:50:07.419]  And you've got the veteran who's a Native American and went to pray where his tribe was from at a tribal site.
[01:50:07.839 --> 01:50:09.180]  You can see the parking lot right there.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:11.340]  He just walks off and gets on his knees to pray.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:23.282]  And a crazy weird control freak, the worst of these park rangers because they're usually leftist, comes over and starts tasing him as he begs and then starts assaulting him more with total mentally ill pleasure.
[01:50:24.082 --> 01:50:26.884]  So, again, the left love police brutality.
[01:50:26.904 --> 01:50:27.744]  They love oppression.
[01:50:27.764 --> 01:50:29.326]  Where they're in control, they have death camps.
[01:50:29.906 --> 01:50:31.347]  And they're dreaming about that here.
[01:50:31.627 --> 01:50:35.910]  They've got big lists on Twitter of who they want arrested and how they want me dead.
[01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:38.031]  Andrew Tate, where do you see all this headed?
[01:50:38.051 --> 01:50:38.912]  Where do you see this going?
[01:50:40.114 --> 01:50:41.495]  These people are never happy, Alex.
[01:50:41.856 --> 01:50:42.816]  There's no bottom.
[01:50:43.217 --> 01:50:46.380]  There's no ending to this absolute insanity.
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.001]  You're never woke enough.
[01:50:48.402 --> 01:50:49.563]  You're never liberal enough.
[01:50:49.943 --> 01:50:51.524]  You're never compliant enough.
[01:50:51.965 --> 01:50:56.069]  If you breathe without paperwork, one day you're going to be fined.
[01:50:56.129 --> 01:50:59.632]  If you don't pay that fine, even though they've taken your job, you're going to jail.
[01:50:59.932 --> 01:51:01.854]  There's no ending for these people.
[01:51:02.154 --> 01:51:04.356]  There's nothing they're ever going to be happy with.
[01:51:04.696 --> 01:51:08.099]  You cannot comply and satisfy them on any level.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.123]  In 10 years from now, people are going to be sitting and wondering, what went wrong?
[01:51:13.604 --> 01:51:14.765]  What happened to the world?
[01:51:15.205 --> 01:51:17.647]  Why didn't we resist when we had the chance?
[01:51:18.067 --> 01:51:19.589]  The chance is right now!
[01:51:20.353 --> 01:51:21.434]  Now is your chance.
[01:51:21.874 --> 01:51:22.474]  This is it.
[01:51:22.854 --> 01:51:25.415]  This is the beginning of something which is never going to end.
[01:51:25.816 --> 01:51:29.858]  And unless people stand up and do something, it's going to get perpetually worse.
[01:51:30.158 --> 01:51:33.579]  These people cannot be satisfied on any level, ever.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:45.725]  And when people finally understand and realize that, they'll realize they're not taking your livelihood and destroying your ability to visit your own family on a holiday because they care about you.
[01:51:46.065 --> 01:51:53.450]  They're doing it to dehumanize you, to upset you, to put you in a point of submissiveness so they can turn you into a slave.
[01:51:53.850 --> 01:51:55.812]  I do not use that word lightly.
[01:51:56.132 --> 01:52:03.337]  This is nothing other than an exercise purely attributed towards creating slaves.
[01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:24.917]  This is a slave induction ceremony of cult-like total submission of throwing away all logic, all science, all facts, all based on lies, and then even sending COVID patients into nursing homes to give half the deaths, and then giving themselves awards for actually killing half the people themselves, killing the rest with these
[01:52:26.238 --> 01:52:28.761]  Ventilators that they admit are actually killing the people.
[01:52:29.442 --> 01:52:32.025]  This new congressman went in sick.
[01:52:32.446 --> 01:52:33.707]  They put a tube down his throat.
[01:52:33.727 --> 01:52:34.568]  He had a heart attack.
[01:52:34.868 --> 01:52:35.910]  They said he died of COVID.
[01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:37.331]  The doctor says he died of a heart attack.
[01:52:37.592 --> 01:52:42.878]  This is just a giant organized revolution of criminal control freak takeover.
[01:52:43.098 --> 01:52:43.819]  You're absolutely right.
[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:47.441]  History is repeating itself, and I don't want this to be tyranny.
[01:52:47.561 --> 01:52:48.962]  I don't want us to be in deep trouble.
[01:52:49.282 --> 01:52:51.443]  But denial, folks, is getting us there.
[01:52:51.743 --> 01:52:54.004]  The mayor of Austin's trying to declare martial law.
[01:52:54.324 --> 01:52:58.306]  He's trying to declare nighttime curfews for COVID, saying the hospitals are full.
[01:52:59.046 --> 01:53:01.507]  Yesterday showed you the CDC up-to-the-day numbers.
[01:53:02.608 --> 01:53:06.509]  The hospital beds in Austin are at 9% capacity.
[01:53:06.829 --> 01:53:08.290]  It's a damn hoax!
[01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:10.311]  The mayor is a criminal liar!
[01:53:12.418 --> 01:53:13.438]  Absolutely it's a lie!
[01:53:13.858 --> 01:53:14.739]  All of it is a lie!
[01:53:14.799 --> 01:53:16.139]  From the beginning it's been a lie!
[01:53:16.419 --> 01:53:17.719]  The death rates are a lie!
[01:53:17.959 --> 01:53:19.300]  The case numbers are a lie!
[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:21.320]  The hospitals being full are a lie!
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:22.921]  It's all a lie!
[01:53:23.221 --> 01:53:39.165]  And even though they get caught repeatedly, Alex, the people who demand you stay in your home and don't see your family get caught breaking their own rules and people are still complying!
[01:53:39.978 --> 01:53:48.823]  If that doesn't prove that the mass agenda towards slavery is at least in some parts successful, I don't know what will!
[01:53:49.264 --> 01:53:52.886]  How does that not prove their slavery agenda is successful?
[01:53:53.226 --> 01:54:02.772]  People are getting caught, the people making the rules are ignoring the rules, but these bitch-made humans are still complying with the laws!
[01:54:03.439 --> 01:54:04.441]  This is slavery!
[01:54:05.222 --> 01:54:06.123]  Andrew, you're on fire!
[01:54:06.183 --> 01:54:06.824]  You're on fire!
[01:54:06.844 --> 01:54:07.805]  You ever want to guest host?
[01:54:08.066 --> 01:54:08.807]  You ever want to guest host?
[01:54:08.827 --> 01:54:09.387]  Come to the whole show.
[01:54:09.407 --> 01:54:09.968]  Let me just say this.
[01:54:10.509 --> 01:54:18.420]  Every hour I see a mayor or a member of parliament or a member of congress or every democrat governor whether it's Whitmer or whether it is
[01:54:19.721 --> 01:54:22.103]  All of them have been caught out at big parties.
[01:54:22.243 --> 01:54:22.803]  No mask.
[01:54:22.903 --> 01:54:23.944]  They get to go out on boats.
[01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:24.984]  Nobody else can.
[01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:25.865]  They go to restaurants.
[01:54:25.905 --> 01:54:26.525]  Nobody else can.
[01:54:26.785 --> 01:54:29.447]  The governor owns a bunch of restaurants in California.
[01:54:29.507 --> 01:54:30.307]  His stay opens.
[01:54:30.387 --> 01:54:31.188]  No one else can.
[01:54:31.208 --> 01:54:32.648]  And people go, that's not right.
[01:54:32.728 --> 01:54:37.171]  It's an exercise of pissing on our face, rubbing it in, dominating us.
[01:54:37.211 --> 01:54:37.931]  That's what this is.
[01:54:38.111 --> 01:54:45.075]  This is an exercise of humiliation and of a paradox of hypocrisy by these goddamn fucking criminals.
[01:54:45.415 --> 01:54:46.216]  Sorry, delay that.
[01:54:48.124 --> 01:54:49.184]  Absolutely, that's what it is.
[01:54:49.664 --> 01:54:59.427]  They love the control element that comes from us knowing, us knowing they want us to know that the rules are for us, but the rules are not for them.
[01:54:59.747 --> 01:55:03.048]  The destruction of livelihoods is for us, but it's not for them.
[01:55:03.308 --> 01:55:07.489]  The restriction of freedom is for us, but it will never be for them.
[01:55:07.809 --> 01:55:11.730]  They enjoy the power that comes with us knowing that.
[01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:13.511]  They are not trying to hide it.
[01:55:13.811 --> 01:55:15.731]  They make it very obvious and apparent.
[01:55:16.132 --> 01:55:17.792]  You are a second class
[01:55:27.794 --> 01:55:30.155]  History is coming, January 5th and 6th.
[01:55:30.915 --> 01:55:40.417]  I've talked a lot to the White House, I've talked a lot to people surrounding that, and they agree that we need to have a giant crowd there.
[01:55:40.457 --> 01:55:44.358]  The 5th, I'll explain at the start of the next hour, ahead of John Rappaport taking over.
[01:55:45.879 --> 01:55:52.181]  But as I told you earlier in the show, and then right before Trump tweeted, I said I would expect imminent Trump will say he's going to be at this rally.
[01:55:52.541 --> 01:55:54.662]  Here he is, January 6th, see you in DC.
[01:55:55.142 --> 01:55:58.964]  And then supposedly by the night, you'll hear specifics of where it is and what's going to be happening.
[01:56:00.785 --> 01:56:01.765]  No one will put the money up.
[01:56:03.145 --> 01:56:05.386]  And this is like a couple weeks ago.
[01:56:05.506 --> 01:56:06.967]  So I began to put some of the money up.
[01:56:08.874 --> 01:56:12.377]  It takes hundreds of thousands for those big stage jumbotrons and all the rest of it.
[01:56:13.017 --> 01:56:15.740]  And then other people came in and helped pay for the lion's share of it.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:16.841]  We're very appreciative to them.
[01:56:17.461 --> 01:56:19.643]  God really came through, but it was a lot of money.
[01:56:20.925 --> 01:56:25.907]  And then I just got asked to put more money in for the 5th today, and I'm going to put forward the money.
[01:56:26.167 --> 01:56:28.148]  In fact, I just pulled the trigger and wired it earlier.
[01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:29.969]  So they were like, are you good for this?
[01:56:29.989 --> 01:56:30.489]  We're doing this.
[01:56:30.509 --> 01:56:30.930]  You do that?
[01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.790]  I'm like, yep, boom.
[01:56:32.090 --> 01:56:32.550]  Pull the trigger.
[01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:33.951]  You saw what happened a minute later.
[01:56:34.371 --> 01:56:39.753]  So we're all in coordination, attack formation, peacefully to awaken the world and say no to the globalists.
[01:56:39.774 --> 01:56:45.056]  But the president is behind all of this, and I knew he would be, but I had to be a leader and take action first.
[01:56:45.436 --> 01:56:46.376]  It's not about taking credit.
[01:56:46.797 --> 01:56:48.437]  It's about you can do this too, folks.
[01:56:48.497 --> 01:56:49.338]  It's leadership.
[01:56:49.958 --> 01:56:57.043]  Alright, talking about leadership, Andrew Tate's a world champion kickboxer, not in the little weenie leagues, you know, in the big ones.
[01:56:59.085 --> 01:57:02.307]  He's definitely got a big slice of his dad, world champion chess player.
[01:57:02.548 --> 01:57:03.809]  He and his brother are both great guys.
[01:57:05.111 --> 01:57:06.091]  Your brother on here sometime.
[01:57:06.111 --> 01:57:07.072]  He's really smart as well.
[01:57:07.492 --> 01:57:09.132]  And I just want to hear your idea.
[01:57:09.152 --> 01:57:10.093]  You challenge me.
[01:57:10.133 --> 01:57:10.773]  I'll challenge you.
[01:57:10.793 --> 01:57:11.633]  We challenge everybody.
[01:57:11.673 --> 01:57:18.355]  Let's up our game as leaders, as men, and let's be leaders and really get aggressive against this fraud.
[01:57:18.716 --> 01:57:25.998]  Sue companies that try to make you wear a mask, showing you give you bacterial pneumonia and doesn't help the fraud, going in public, not wearing them, educating people.
[01:57:25.998 --> 01:57:30.820]  I'm going to drive around the next few days my armored vehicle saying I'm not obeying the mayor's curfew.
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:31.521]  Burning hell.
[01:57:32.181 --> 01:57:35.503]  I'm going to drive around a couple hours tonight, a couple hours tomorrow night.
[01:57:35.783 --> 01:57:36.603]  And it's fun!
[01:57:36.623 --> 01:57:38.564]  It's not making me weak, it's making me stronger.
[01:57:38.884 --> 01:57:40.425]  Andrew, what do you think we should do?
[01:57:41.923 --> 01:57:42.823]  Absolutely agree with you.
[01:57:42.904 --> 01:57:44.824]  And I think this is a war of attrition.
[01:57:45.365 --> 01:57:46.485]  I will give you a quick example.
[01:57:46.885 --> 01:57:49.807]  I was in Germany recently where absolutely everybody complies.
[01:57:50.307 --> 01:57:54.969]  If you don't wear a mask, the police instantly deploy and ask you to wear a mask.
[01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:59.891]  And I'm also, I live in Romania where people are far more, they're Eastern European.
[01:58:00.171 --> 01:58:01.492]  They've been through these communist
[01:58:02.176 --> 01:58:02.396]  I think?
[01:58:17.536 --> 01:58:19.758]  Unless you're asked to wear a mask.
[01:58:20.118 --> 01:58:22.160]  If everybody does that, it will end.
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:27.964]  Imagine you work in a store, and every single person who walks in, please put a mask on, even if they put it on.
[01:58:28.244 --> 01:58:30.506]  Okay, next, please put a mask on, please put a mask on.
[01:58:30.766 --> 01:58:32.988]  After two days, you're going to be bored of it.
[01:58:33.508 --> 01:58:34.349]  You're going to be bored of it.
[01:58:34.429 --> 01:58:35.430]  It's a war of attrition.
[01:58:35.930 --> 01:58:40.213]  Until you tell me to comply and threaten me, I don't comply.
[01:58:40.574 --> 01:58:42.775]  I will not voluntarily muzzle myself.
[01:58:42.896 --> 01:58:43.776]  I don't want to get arrested.
[01:58:43.816 --> 01:58:45.578]  I'm not recommending anyone get themselves in big trouble.
[01:58:45.838 --> 01:58:46.498]  Just walk out.
[01:58:46.779 --> 01:58:47.519]  Don't wear a mask.
[01:58:47.819 --> 01:58:48.500]  Live your life.
[01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:51.302]  And if they really threaten you, okay, put one on.
[01:58:51.603 --> 01:58:52.524]  Crisis averted.
[01:58:52.764 --> 01:58:58.529]  But if everybody did this, the people who are in charge, the little do-gooders of the police, they'd get tired of it.
[01:58:58.749 --> 01:59:02.292]  They'd get tired of constantly asking, please put a mask on.
[01:59:02.513 --> 01:59:05.816]  It's a war of attrition, and I've seen this in countries where people don't comply.
[01:59:05.836 --> 01:59:08.198]  In Romania at the beginning, they used to ask.
[01:59:08.618 --> 01:59:11.761]  Now they're at the point where I walk in with no mask, and you know what they do?
[01:59:12.081 --> 01:59:13.563]  They just think, whatever.
[01:59:13.963 --> 01:59:15.785]  People don't wear them now, whatever.
[01:59:16.125 --> 01:59:17.166]  It's a war of attrition.
[01:59:17.406 --> 01:59:24.953]  We have to grind them down by showing, if you want me to comply with your slavery, you need to be prepared to enforce it.
[01:59:25.313 --> 01:59:27.175]  They cannot enforce it against all of us.
[01:59:27.535 --> 01:59:31.018]  They rely on us enforcing it on ourselves.
[01:59:31.359 --> 01:59:38.005]  They rely on us masking up before we go out without any kind of threat of repercussion, without any kind of enforcement.
[01:59:38.445 --> 01:59:40.446]  Stop doing that!
[01:59:40.466 --> 01:59:44.188]  You can always afford to avoid getting yourself arrested and just put the mask on.
[01:59:44.568 --> 01:59:45.949]  Nothing bad is going to happen to you.
[01:59:46.329 --> 01:59:51.392]  Worst case, you put a mask on when they call the police and say, sorry, I didn't realize I had one in my pocket.
[01:59:51.792 --> 01:59:52.572]  End of crisis.
[01:59:52.933 --> 01:59:54.013]  It's a war of attrition.
[01:59:54.333 --> 01:59:57.115]  If everybody started doing that, this would end.
[01:59:57.615 --> 02:00:06.021]  The only reason the police feel compelled to destroy the one person without a mask is because he's the one person without a mask.
[02:00:06.301 --> 02:00:08.283]  They cannot enforce it on all of us.
[02:00:08.543 --> 02:00:16.709]  You have a duty as an adult and as a man to save your family and your children and future generations from slavery and tyranny.
[02:00:17.029 --> 02:00:21.592]  And you do that by not complying to slavery at this point in your life.
[02:00:21.992 --> 02:00:24.374]  Do not comply without enforcement.
[02:00:24.914 --> 02:00:29.878]  Every single person watching this, if you start doing that, you'll see a shift in the narrative near instantly.
[02:00:29.918 --> 02:00:36.022]  I've seen it myself in real time in countries where people just stop putting them on unless the police tell them to.
[02:00:36.322 --> 02:00:37.863]  Within a week, it's over.
[02:00:38.404 --> 02:00:42.347]  And Andrew Tate, if you look at Australia, it's the socialist run cities are the worst.
[02:00:42.487 --> 02:00:43.247]  Same thing in the UK.
[02:00:43.607 --> 02:00:45.929]  The more you submit, the deeper the lockdowns get.
[02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:49.632]  We've gotten internal documents out of the EU, the UK, Australia and Canada.
[02:00:49.952 --> 02:00:51.133]  They're all unified saying
[02:00:51.613 --> 02:00:54.355]  We've got COVID 2.0, COVID, you know, 2030.
[02:00:54.715 --> 02:00:58.978]  They've got all these rollouts, never going to let us get out of it, never going to stop.
[02:00:59.058 --> 02:01:03.780]  And by increments, they show us what happens in Australia 12 months ago, or nine months ago.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:04.581]  Now it comes here.
[02:01:05.121 --> 02:01:08.163]  They're literally monkey see, monkey do, showing us how to be good slaves.
[02:01:08.403 --> 02:01:09.404]  We've got to start pushing back.
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:22.474]  If you love control, if it's the number one thing you desire in the world, and you manage to steal huge amounts of control and huge amounts of freedom from the general populace, would you ever give it back?
[02:01:24.356 --> 02:01:30.503]  No, if I was a control freak or a psychopath that just is compelled to have power over people, I would be happier than a pig, and you know what?
[02:01:30.523 --> 02:01:31.424]  Like Bill Gates is right now.
[02:01:32.637 --> 02:01:34.199]  Absolutely, I would never give it back.
[02:01:34.499 --> 02:01:41.166]  And I would come up with COVID 2.0, COVID iPad Max Pro, COVID 38.
[02:01:41.306 --> 02:01:51.035]  I'd come up with any excuse to make people stay at home so I can go out when they're not allowed and feel some pathetic immature buzz knowing that they're a second class human.
[02:01:51.416 --> 02:01:52.277]  That's all this is.
[02:01:52.857 --> 02:01:57.058]  People, listen, I'm not saying, I said this to one of my, to my girlfriend.
[02:01:57.098 --> 02:01:58.979]  I said, look, I don't want you getting arrested.
[02:01:58.999 --> 02:01:59.459]  You're a girl.
[02:01:59.479 --> 02:02:00.740]  I don't want you tackled to the ground.
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.800]  Don't put it on unless they threaten you.
[02:02:03.441 --> 02:02:15.865]  And you'd be amazed how far you can get just not wearing it, putting a smile on your face, being polite, being a human to other humans, walking into a store with a smile saying, oh, sorry, I forgot mine.
[02:02:16.085 --> 02:02:17.125]  I just want to grab something.
[02:02:17.145 --> 02:02:17.606]  Andrew.
[02:02:36.286 --> 02:02:38.528]  And Andrew, what you said is so key, I need to make a bigger deal out of this.
[02:02:39.048 --> 02:02:58.465]  The globalists like Larry Page and Sergey Brin and others at Google, worth 50, 100 billion a piece, whatever, ones like worth 50, ones worth like 60, they have giant palatial estates, they have jumbo jets, they have everything, and also they don't follow the rules, so all these billionaires that are going along with this, other than Elon Musk who's been fighting it,
[02:02:58.925 --> 02:03:01.229]  They all exempt themselves just as you said.
[02:03:01.489 --> 02:03:02.691]  They go on private jets.
[02:03:02.932 --> 02:03:04.334]  They're not wearing masks on there.
[02:03:04.394 --> 02:03:05.436]  It's a class thing.
[02:03:05.736 --> 02:03:07.960]  It's absolutely a class thing and they love it.
[02:03:09.352 --> 02:03:10.212]  Of course they love it!
[02:03:10.592 --> 02:03:12.453]  You are a second-class citizen!
[02:03:12.693 --> 02:03:14.673]  I'll tell you an absolutely true story, Alex.
[02:03:14.713 --> 02:03:15.333]  I'll make it quick.
[02:03:15.713 --> 02:03:23.275]  I flew on a budget airline from Bucharest, Romania to London, England and was forced to wear a mask in the airport and on the plane and landing.
[02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:24.475]  It upset me.
[02:03:24.755 --> 02:03:28.136]  So on the way back, I chartered a private jet from London to Bucharest, €15,000.
[02:03:28.256 --> 02:03:30.836]  I chartered a private jet.
[02:03:31.056 --> 02:03:33.097]  There were no masks in the private airport.
[02:03:33.377 --> 02:03:34.857]  Not a single mask on the plane.
[02:03:35.217 --> 02:03:39.982]  The pilots were not wearing a mask, no COVID paperwork, no masks when I landed.
[02:03:40.202 --> 02:03:44.987]  There was no mention of COVID-19 or masks once they realized I was rich.
[02:03:45.328 --> 02:03:46.989]  It is for second-class citizens.
[02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:50.213]  Putting a mask on your face is agreeing and accepting.
[02:03:50.593 --> 02:03:57.681]  I am a slave to the globalists who control the financial system and have rigged it to keep me too poor to provide for my family.
[02:03:57.961 --> 02:04:03.965]  You are sacrificing the freedom of yourself and your entire lineage every time you put a mask on your face.
[02:04:04.246 --> 02:04:05.487]  It is not a small deal.
[02:04:05.907 --> 02:04:06.707]  It's a big deal.
[02:04:07.008 --> 02:04:14.193]  A government cannot mandate what you put on your face in the name of safety for something which is not dangerous.
[02:04:14.573 --> 02:04:15.514]  It is tyranny.
[02:04:15.814 --> 02:04:17.555]  It is nothing less than tyranny.
[02:04:18.096 --> 02:04:18.416]  That's right.
[02:04:18.436 --> 02:04:19.557]  Let's expand on that.
[02:04:19.577 --> 02:04:20.798]  What you said is absolutely true.
[02:04:22.335 --> 02:04:44.148]  The establishment has exempted itself from everything, and this is a class thing, and we have to say no to them, and let them know that we know, and let them know the economic turmoil and the collapse is on them, and let them know that we know all their companies have basically doubled their wealth during this, and it's disgusting, and so we've just got to unify around this.
[02:04:45.879 --> 02:04:46.480]  Absolutely.
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:48.081]  They're taking control of everything.
[02:04:48.101 --> 02:04:52.204]  They want to control the water you drink, the land you live on, the air you breathe.
[02:04:52.504 --> 02:04:56.747]  They're going to own absolutely everything, and it doesn't matter what number you give them.
[02:04:56.767 --> 02:04:57.867]  It doesn't matter about money.
[02:04:58.108 --> 02:04:59.228]  They're beyond billions.
[02:04:59.268 --> 02:05:00.489]  They're beyond the stock market.
[02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:01.450]  They're going to own
[02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.630]  Yes.
[02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:02.611]  Hold on, let's do five more minutes.
[02:05:02.631 --> 02:05:03.111]  Five more minutes.
[02:05:30.953 --> 02:05:39.067]  Back in two minutes, I want to do five more minutes with Andrew Tate, who's absolutely, I mean, everybody's got to get this interview and send it around to folks, because he's definitely hitting on all cylinders today.
[02:05:39.548 --> 02:05:42.333]  And then I'm going to tell you what's really coming up with the big Trump rally in
[02:05:44.005 --> 02:05:44.465]  D.C.
[02:05:44.605 --> 02:05:46.886]  on the 5th and 6th, and where you're going to want to be.
[02:05:47.487 --> 02:05:47.767]  Okay?
[02:05:48.367 --> 02:05:51.609]  Because now I can tell you what is going on.
[02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:57.292]  So I'm very, very excited to be able to break all this news and information for you, coming up.
[02:05:57.332 --> 02:05:57.952]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:58.192 --> 02:06:02.955]  Well, Trump's totally surrounded by globalists, and he's been deserted by most of the other pieces on the board.
[02:06:03.315 --> 02:06:08.878]  But this pawn is still in the fight, because it's about ideas, not about just these chess pieces.
[02:06:09.807 --> 02:06:12.108]  And we can be resurrected, ladies and gentlemen, politically.
[02:06:12.508 --> 02:06:16.931]  Physically, an individual dies, but ideas are bulletproof, as V said in Viva Vendetta.
[02:06:17.391 --> 02:06:24.495]  Andrew Tate's going to host the last four minutes of this segment, then I'm going to come back and give you some inside baseball, some really important info, and then Jon Rappaport's going to take over.
[02:06:24.535 --> 02:06:27.396]  But, Andrew Tate, you've been on fire, particularly today.
[02:06:27.416 --> 02:06:28.477]  Go ahead and close us out.
[02:06:30.404 --> 02:06:31.004]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:06:31.044 --> 02:06:38.149]  I think the last thing I want to talk about, I get asked a lot, constantly, about this vaccine and if I will be taking the vaccine.
[02:06:38.589 --> 02:06:48.516]  And I want to make it very, very clear that I will be doing my utmost to resist allowing any vaccine to be injected into me for a disease which cannot hurt me.
[02:06:49.096 --> 02:06:52.719]  It is widely accepted and reported that COVID-19 has an over 99% survival rate.
[02:06:54.701 --> 02:07:03.714]  Why do I need an injection if my body and my immune system has a 99.9% survival rate?
[02:07:03.954 --> 02:07:05.797]  I'm already immune to this disease.
[02:07:05.857 --> 02:07:07.059]  I can beat this disease.
[02:07:07.702 --> 02:07:12.345]  This injection, in the best possible case, is useless.
[02:07:12.865 --> 02:07:15.907]  In the worst possible case, it is going to harm me.
[02:07:16.327 --> 02:07:17.308]  It is going to hurt me.
[02:07:17.688 --> 02:07:22.311]  And the fact they are trying to mandate this, and that's what they will do, they will do it slowly.
[02:07:22.611 --> 02:07:25.933]  They will not mandate it by law because there'll be mass uprising.
[02:07:26.233 --> 02:07:27.734]  They'll mandate it slowly.
[02:07:28.014 --> 02:07:30.616]  If you want to work here, you need the vaccine.
[02:07:30.936 --> 02:07:32.977]  If you want to go here, you need the vaccine.
[02:07:33.298 --> 02:07:35.639]  If you want to travel, you need the vaccine.
[02:07:35.919 --> 02:07:37.981]  You can't get on a plane without the injection.
[02:07:38.261 --> 02:07:41.203]  The never-ending small encroachments of freedom.
[02:07:41.464 --> 02:07:42.905]  That's how they take your freedom away.
[02:07:43.185 --> 02:07:44.026]  Not all at once.
[02:07:44.386 --> 02:07:48.749]  The only mass freedom-stealing exercise I've seen are these lockdowns.
[02:07:49.090 --> 02:07:50.611]  In general, they do it little by little.
[02:07:51.051 --> 02:07:54.493]  And they're doing it with this injection, which has not been tested.
[02:07:54.533 --> 02:07:56.054]  We have no long-term testing.
[02:07:56.494 --> 02:08:03.018]  It's the quickest, the quickest instruction of and discovery of a vaccine in human history.
[02:08:03.378 --> 02:08:06.299]  We have no idea what the side effects could possibly be.
[02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:15.304]  And they're telling you for your own safety, even though your body is perfectly capable of beating this disease, you must take this injection.
[02:08:15.705 --> 02:08:19.907]  If that does not inspire some degree of
[02:08:21.172 --> 02:08:22.333]  Resistance in you.
[02:08:22.653 --> 02:08:27.417]  You must sit there and question, why do they want me to take this injection so badly?
[02:08:28.458 --> 02:08:30.099]  What is possibly in this injection?
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:31.781]  Maybe the injection won't hurt me.
[02:08:32.061 --> 02:08:35.764]  Okay, but why do they want me to take it so badly when my body can already beat it?
[02:08:35.824 --> 02:08:36.925]  And I'll tell you something.
[02:08:37.358 --> 02:08:40.440]  There's a few people who have taken the injection and they seem to be perfectly fine.
[02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:42.481]  We can talk to them in 10 years from now.
[02:08:42.781 --> 02:08:45.623]  But I have another theory and my theory is very, very simple.
[02:08:46.063 --> 02:08:50.245]  There is no bigger and no better power control.
[02:08:50.546 --> 02:08:57.790]  There's nothing more than a control freak would love than to force people to take a meaningless injection on mass.
[02:08:58.170 --> 02:08:59.891]  And if you want the power trick,
[02:09:00.451 --> 02:09:07.657]  If you want the power trip of forcing people to inject themselves, you're not going to enjoy it if they believe they need the injection.
[02:09:08.017 --> 02:09:11.179]  If they believe they need it, then you're not going to enjoy it the same.
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:13.121]  How do you enjoy control?
[02:09:13.521 --> 02:09:17.464]  You tell people, this coronavirus cannot hurt you.
[02:09:17.804 --> 02:09:20.727]  You have a 99.9% survival chance.
[02:09:21.047 --> 02:09:22.388]  You are perfectly fine.
[02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:25.289]  Go get an injection anyway.
[02:09:25.770 --> 02:09:26.890]  Nobody knows what's in it.
[02:09:27.371 --> 02:09:29.031]  Nobody knows what the side effects are.
[02:09:29.392 --> 02:09:34.835]  Go get it anyway, even though you don't need it because I said so.
[02:09:35.315 --> 02:09:36.515]  That is a power trip.
[02:09:37.076 --> 02:09:38.176]  That's all this is.
[02:09:38.516 --> 02:09:39.497]  And let me tell you something.
[02:09:39.757 --> 02:09:41.618]  There's a level beyond millions of dollars.
[02:09:41.858 --> 02:09:43.559]  There's a level beyond billions of dollars.
[02:09:43.839 --> 02:09:51.382]  And if you're born into that world, the only enjoyment you can possibly get from this existence is control.
[02:09:51.642 --> 02:09:52.983]  That's all they've ever wanted.
[02:09:53.283 --> 02:09:54.724]  It's all they're ever going to want.
[02:09:55.064 --> 02:09:57.445]  And they will never have enough.
[02:09:57.785 --> 02:10:02.106]  There will never be a point where they're happy with the amount of control they have over your life.
[02:10:02.426 --> 02:10:08.248]  This is the first pointless injection of very, very many if everybody complies.
[02:10:08.628 --> 02:10:11.409]  You do not need that injection because you are fine without it.
[02:10:11.649 --> 02:10:13.449]  You were fine without it in 2019.
[02:10:13.709 --> 02:10:15.150]  You're fine without it right now.
[02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:17.290]  And you're going to be fine without it in 2021.
[02:10:17.630 --> 02:10:21.531]  This mass injection exercise is nothing more than a power trip.
[02:10:22.051 --> 02:10:23.972]  And I'm telling you, there's going to be casualties.
[02:10:24.492 --> 02:10:29.534]  This power trip is going to cost lives, and they have no remorse, no guilt.
[02:10:30.014 --> 02:10:37.756]  So when they tell you they care about your safety, or that they care about the lives of other people, you can know it is absolutely a fallacy.
[02:10:38.116 --> 02:10:39.477]  They don't care who dies.
[02:10:39.837 --> 02:10:45.719]  They just want to see you, the second class people, the people below them, they want to see you comply.
[02:10:46.179 --> 02:10:52.861]  All right, folks, we've got some big, breaking, exclusive news here for you that I am now authorized to tell you.
[02:10:54.215 --> 02:10:55.655]  Going back when I was in D.C.
[02:10:55.735 --> 02:11:13.900]  two weeks ago, we looked at the date, January 6, and we thought, that's probably going to be one of the most important times to shoot down the attempted fraudulent installation or installment of the Chinese Communist puppet, Joe Biden.
[02:11:14.441 --> 02:11:21.343]  That's when they'll try to have a debate about the Senate going ahead and seating the electors towards the 20th and
[02:11:23.868 --> 02:11:24.608]  The inauguration.
[02:11:25.188 --> 02:11:29.150]  And the stage is being built for the inauguration, but Joe Biden says he's not going to be there because it's going to be virtual.
[02:11:29.890 --> 02:11:31.190]  I think that's a bait and switch.
[02:11:32.691 --> 02:11:33.551]  He knows he's hated.
[02:11:33.671 --> 02:11:35.272]  He wants to say he's not going to have one.
[02:11:35.292 --> 02:11:37.432]  I think a day before he'll announce and be there.
[02:11:37.632 --> 02:11:39.433]  They're worried about us being there to protest him.
[02:11:39.633 --> 02:11:40.353]  Of course we will.
[02:11:41.534 --> 02:11:42.694]  If they go down that path.
[02:11:44.795 --> 02:11:44.975]  So.
[02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:51.935]  I'm going to talk a lot of folks and they said, yes, the 6th is a good day to do that.
[02:11:52.515 --> 02:11:58.959]  And then you notice Trump, I guess it was in the ether, said big demonstration coming up on the 6th.
[02:11:59.139 --> 02:12:00.140]  I will see you there.
[02:12:01.421 --> 02:12:07.625]  Because he didn't even know about the demonstration we had on the 12th until it happened.
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:11.982]  So we had one a month ago.
[02:12:12.002 --> 02:12:13.585]  We had one a few weeks ago.
[02:12:14.186 --> 02:12:17.612]  The first one was the biggest one, probably a million people, conservatively half a million.
[02:12:18.213 --> 02:12:20.677]  The second one, a few hundred thousand, but a bunch of different groups split up.
[02:12:21.358 --> 02:12:23.622]  This one's going to be the big one to repudiate the whole system.
[02:12:25.359 --> 02:12:43.111]  And so, I began to reach all the different groups and organizations that actually had permits, the different groups, and I learned that no one was putting the money up, even though they had, these groups had the permits, for Freedom Plaza, for other areas, and also for the Ellipse in front of the White House.
[02:12:44.692 --> 02:12:47.454]  And so, I put down the first amount of money.
[02:12:48.334 --> 02:12:54.058]  We started looking around for some other donors, none came, and then magically a big donor came through and really helped, that was great.
[02:12:55.509 --> 02:12:57.870]  And the Secret Service is worried about where Trump's going to do it.
[02:12:58.351 --> 02:13:06.655]  First, they didn't want it at Freedom Plaza, then they wanted it on the Mall, then they wanted it at the Ellipse in front of the White House, but spanning out into the larger park.
[02:13:07.215 --> 02:13:08.336]  And so that's where it's going to be.
[02:13:09.056 --> 02:13:24.305]  And the president has not decided exactly when he's going to speak, but it's going to be him with his supporters on the 6th, probably at about 1230, right before all of the big debates in the Senate kick off.
[02:13:26.227 --> 02:13:27.228]  At 1 p.m.
[02:13:27.348 --> 02:13:27.688]  Eastern.
[02:13:29.969 --> 02:13:34.931]  And so, they obviously talked to the different folks that have been involved in this today.
[02:13:35.511 --> 02:13:39.613]  And I said, I'm absolutely happy to, you know, go along with whatever.
[02:13:39.853 --> 02:13:43.475]  I was just there trying to make sure the place was available and ready.
[02:13:44.555 --> 02:13:45.536]  And so now that's the case.
[02:13:45.576 --> 02:13:50.578]  But the president really thinks it's important to have people there on the 5th.
[02:13:50.758 --> 02:13:52.719]  It's almost more important than the 6th.
[02:13:53.619 --> 02:13:54.880]  Even though Trump's going to be the big draw.
[02:13:55.848 --> 02:13:59.649]  And that is going to be an event that I did partially finance.
[02:13:59.709 --> 02:14:01.350]  Another donor came through and financed.
[02:14:02.991 --> 02:14:05.892]  The event on the 5th, it's going to go from about 1 p.m.
[02:14:05.932 --> 02:14:08.112]  in the afternoon into the evening.
[02:14:09.433 --> 02:14:15.095]  And I'm going to be speaking, Roger Stone's going to be speaking, many others, but what it's really about is all of you.
[02:14:15.795 --> 02:14:23.638]  And so you need to get there Sunday, Monday, Tuesday at the latest, because Tuesday and Wednesday are the times.
[02:14:23.698 --> 02:14:23.998]  And listen,
[02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:26.978]  They've already closed some hotels.
[02:14:26.998 --> 02:14:28.899]  They've already said, oh, we don't want these Trump people here.
[02:14:28.939 --> 02:14:31.140]  The mayor's already said, oh, COVID, no one's allowed to come in.
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:32.521]  If you're an illegal alien, that's fine.
[02:14:32.541 --> 02:14:34.022]  If you're a criminal, it's fine.
[02:14:34.683 --> 02:14:35.923]  But citizens don't come to D.C.
[02:14:36.224 --> 02:14:38.545]  Folks, park your car wherever you want.
[02:14:38.645 --> 02:14:39.966]  Sleep on the ground wherever you want.
[02:14:40.306 --> 02:14:42.047]  Put tents up in front of the Washington Monument.
[02:14:42.467 --> 02:14:44.709]  It's time to stop complying.
[02:14:44.829 --> 02:14:46.910]  It's time for civil disobedience.
[02:14:47.530 --> 02:14:49.992]  The illegal aliens can build whatever they want.
[02:14:50.452 --> 02:14:51.333]  The homeless can put up
[02:14:52.622 --> 02:14:55.223]  Tense in front of our houses here in Austin or in Los Angeles.
[02:14:55.243 --> 02:14:56.663]  But oh, don't come to D.C.
[02:14:56.943 --> 02:15:03.105]  If you're a Trump supporter, don't come here and camp out on your own land, on public land, and saying we're not accepting the fraud that is Joe Biden.
[02:15:04.705 --> 02:15:06.846]  But there are hotels in Virginia right across the river.
[02:15:07.686 --> 02:15:10.166]  But get your hotels now or come in your RV.
[02:15:11.627 --> 02:15:16.848]  But whatever you do, they're going to start shutting the roads down in downtown D.C.
[02:15:17.928 --> 02:15:18.969]  on the 5th.
[02:15:19.749 --> 02:15:20.149]  In the morning.
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:22.321]  And that could change.
[02:15:22.361 --> 02:15:23.961]  It could be on the force now.
[02:15:25.342 --> 02:15:29.044]  But I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:15:29.064 --> 02:15:30.405]  I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[02:15:30.545 --> 02:15:33.286]  And I told you, we don't have a lot of extra money around here.
[02:15:34.207 --> 02:15:39.310]  But I have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in making sure this happened.
[02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:41.551]  And I want you to know that's where your money's been going.
[02:15:42.051 --> 02:15:45.353]  And I was spending money in the next year's budget that I didn't have.
[02:15:46.041 --> 02:15:51.803]  And then a big donor came through, just like in the Bible with the widow's mite, and refilled us right at that point.
[02:15:52.564 --> 02:15:57.266]  But still, our coffers are not where they need to be, and so I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:15:58.566 --> 02:16:05.609]  I would go to infowarestore.com, where X2, the good, clean, deep-earth crystal iodine is back in stock.
[02:16:06.409 --> 02:16:07.430]  That's been sold out for months.
[02:16:08.643 --> 02:16:12.766]  We also have pollen block from specially fed quail eggs from France.
[02:16:13.266 --> 02:16:16.208]  It's a natural antihistamine and gets great results, great reviews.
[02:16:16.548 --> 02:16:19.570]  That's been sold out for eight months because the supply chain broke down.
[02:16:21.151 --> 02:16:26.274]  We also have winter sun, high quality vitamin D3 and vitamin K taken under the tongue.
[02:16:27.095 --> 02:16:28.556]  Absolutely essential for your immune system.
[02:16:29.670 --> 02:16:31.911]  For every virus and every bacteria and everything that's out there.
[02:16:31.931 --> 02:16:32.892]  It's the building blocks, the body.
[02:16:33.112 --> 02:16:34.072]  D3 is really a hormone.
[02:16:34.332 --> 02:16:34.833]  Look into it.
[02:16:35.313 --> 02:16:41.016]  That's massively discounted and in full war store.com and we're selling out very, very quickly.
[02:16:41.056 --> 02:16:43.777]  So it's going to go back to 25% off tomorrow.
[02:16:44.097 --> 02:16:45.518]  It's 50% off today.
[02:16:46.078 --> 02:16:47.659]  Also sold out for months.
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:58.005]  Super male vitality is made by a private label by a very famous organization in Utah that makes these super high-end
[02:16:59.468 --> 02:16:59.928]  Tinctures.
[02:17:00.689 --> 02:17:01.809]  This is cold-pressed.
[02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:03.290]  It's not an alcohol-based.
[02:17:03.590 --> 02:17:08.413]  Takes about three to four times the amount of herbs to make a bottle of this because it's not powdered.
[02:17:08.473 --> 02:17:09.394]  It's not dried.
[02:17:09.514 --> 02:17:11.095]  It's when it's alive and healthy.
[02:17:11.635 --> 02:17:18.239]  They press it like wine, concentrate it, and then condense it three different times.
[02:17:19.019 --> 02:17:22.021]  So they don't just use three to four times the amount of herbs to press it.
[02:17:22.461 --> 02:17:26.624]  They do three pressings of three different groups, and then they let it
[02:17:27.581 --> 02:17:35.425]  Or each group gets pressed three times and then they let it dry out in a vat and then they keep concentrating it on top of it.
[02:17:35.965 --> 02:17:44.309]  That's why people love it so much for stamina, libido, energy, super male vitality, powers the info war.
[02:17:44.369 --> 02:17:47.010]  It's been sold out for months, back in stock, 50% off.
[02:17:47.050 --> 02:17:49.391]  So X tube, super male vitality, 50% off.
[02:17:50.936 --> 02:17:54.080]  And then we've got all the other great products there as well.
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:56.703]  DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[02:17:56.803 --> 02:17:59.046]  The fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:17:59.387 --> 02:18:02.771]  The activated charcoal that's really, really, really popular.
[02:18:03.051 --> 02:18:03.772]  That's been sold out.
[02:18:03.812 --> 02:18:04.633]  That's back in stock.
[02:18:05.014 --> 02:18:05.815]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:07.594 --> 02:18:11.516]  And a lot of people are like, Jones, man, the system is really pissed at you stepping up like this.
[02:18:11.536 --> 02:18:12.417]  They're going to come after you more.
[02:18:12.697 --> 02:18:14.278]  They're coming after everybody.
[02:18:14.358 --> 02:18:18.460]  And I just can't get in a ditch and put my head between my legs and kiss my ass goodbye.
[02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:22.362]  I'm not going down without a full exposure of the globalists.
[02:18:22.682 --> 02:18:27.064]  They're doing all these lockdowns and all this election theft because they're weak, not because they're strong.
[02:18:27.464 --> 02:18:29.926]  And people need to stop bowing to the mouse that roars.
[02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:33.071]  So I know as an audience, you know that you've stood with us.
[02:18:33.091 --> 02:18:33.692]  We've stood with you.
[02:18:33.752 --> 02:18:34.212]  We love you.
[02:18:34.552 --> 02:18:36.213]  We appreciate you and you finance this.
[02:18:36.614 --> 02:18:38.795]  And so you better believe I've committed to you.
[02:18:39.175 --> 02:18:39.515]  I'll give you 110%.
[02:18:39.816 --> 02:18:42.717]  I may stumble sometimes, but I'll never give in.
[02:18:43.378 --> 02:18:44.118]  I'll never give up.
[02:18:44.278 --> 02:18:46.900]  I could give out, but that's all in God's hands.
[02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:52.043]  So please pray for my stamina and my focus and please pray for America and the world to awaken.
[02:18:52.063 --> 02:18:53.124]  Please pray for President Trump.
[02:18:54.175 --> 02:19:01.819]  Please pray for my great crew and the amazing job that they are doing, and we will just all continue to fight together.
[02:19:01.859 --> 02:19:06.382]  But I gotta tell you, I don't care how you get to D.C.
[02:19:06.702 --> 02:19:09.604]  The first event had probably a million people, the next a few hundred thousand.
[02:19:09.644 --> 02:19:13.906]  It wasn't because a couple hundred antifa in the dead of night beat up a few people in parking garages.
[02:19:14.907 --> 02:19:16.888]  They think they scared people off from the second event.
[02:19:17.967 --> 02:19:18.187]  No.
[02:19:18.787 --> 02:19:19.988]  They do that though to try to scare people.
[02:19:20.028 --> 02:19:20.628]  It doesn't work.
[02:19:20.968 --> 02:19:22.629]  We're going to be even bigger this time.
[02:19:22.649 --> 02:19:24.149]  So don't let anything worry you.
[02:19:24.169 --> 02:19:25.269]  Don't let the crowds worry you.
[02:19:25.610 --> 02:19:26.350]  You come there.
[02:19:26.490 --> 02:19:27.090]  You be there.
[02:19:27.450 --> 02:19:29.051]  You let them know they're not going to steal your vote.
[02:19:29.351 --> 02:19:30.631]  The 5th and the 6th.
[02:19:30.671 --> 02:19:32.332]  But the 5th is critical.
[02:19:32.732 --> 02:19:34.112]  The 5th is critical.
[02:19:34.152 --> 02:19:37.954]  We need a giant mass there on the 5th into the 6th.
[02:19:38.994 --> 02:19:40.355]  They try to steal it, continue on.
[02:19:40.575 --> 02:19:41.736]  We're coming back on the 20th.
[02:19:41.816 --> 02:19:42.997]  This is a fight.
[02:19:43.337 --> 02:19:47.861]  Just like you see in Egypt or Romania or wherever, when a government's not legitimate, everybody hits the streets.
[02:19:47.881 --> 02:19:52.844]  Well, this election isn't legitimate, and we've only begun to fight and expose these monsters, and we'll never back down.
[02:19:53.064 --> 02:19:53.885]  We'll never surrender.
[02:19:53.925 --> 02:19:58.348]  And one way or another, politically, lawfully, and legally, Joe Biden will be removed.
[02:19:58.569 --> 02:19:59.889]  He is a Chi-Com traitor.
[02:20:00.310 --> 02:20:00.750]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:01.871]  Sean Rappaport's about to take over.
[02:20:02.531 --> 02:20:03.232]  Okay, folks.
[02:20:04.053 --> 02:20:07.275]  Hello again from the bunker.
[02:20:09.531 --> 02:20:16.234]  Let's start off with the fake mutation story, because that's what has everybody all agog.
[02:20:17.355 --> 02:20:34.742]  This is obviously just a piece of drooling fiction designed to perpetuate the lockdowns, to enforce more vaccinations so that they can say, well, we need 16 vaccinations, different ones instead of one, because it keeps mutating.
[02:20:34.822 --> 02:20:38.184]  So everybody like the flu vaccine is going to have to get it every year.
[02:20:38.993 --> 02:20:40.334]  Or even every six months.
[02:20:42.056 --> 02:20:44.177]  They have no idea what they're talking about.
[02:20:44.778 --> 02:20:49.842]  Even within their own crime syndicate, they're sending mixed messages.
[02:20:50.703 --> 02:20:52.424]  They're a complete total mess.
[02:20:53.105 --> 02:20:59.530]  There is no mutation strain, a new mutation strain, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:21:00.090 --> 02:21:06.856]  It's just a prop job that was designed to occur now as the vaccine is being released.
[02:21:07.799 --> 02:21:18.327]  To perpetuate them saying, well, you see, we're not even sure if after you get the vaccine that that's going to stop you from transmitting the virus.
[02:21:19.488 --> 02:21:26.053]  And you'll be partially protected, but you have to keep wearing the masks and we have to keep locking you down.
[02:21:26.814 --> 02:21:30.076]  And businesses, more businesses will be destroyed.
[02:21:30.657 --> 02:21:33.779]  And it's just going to go on and on and on and on and on.
[02:21:36.772 --> 02:21:37.773]  That's what they're saying.
[02:21:39.094 --> 02:21:44.697]  Through every possible orifice that they can grab of government and major media.
[02:21:46.018 --> 02:21:50.501]  How can there be a new strain when they have no evidence there was an old strain?
[02:21:52.343 --> 02:21:55.505]  That's the real story in case anybody's interested.
[02:21:59.508 --> 02:22:02.369]  And I've described that story many times here on the show.
[02:22:04.811 --> 02:22:05.712]  The documents
[02:22:07.062 --> 02:22:21.214]  That are original documents with both the CDC and the so-called Drosten Group in Europe, in which they were putting together the PCR tests for the virus, and they readily admitted that they did not have the virus.
[02:22:21.234 --> 02:22:29.401]  You know, we're going to make a test for the virus, and this is going to be a really good test, and there's only one problem.
[02:22:29.421 --> 02:22:30.542]  We don't have the virus.
[02:22:31.821 --> 02:22:39.106]  We don't have the virus because we can't get the virus because nobody has the virus because everybody's concocting stories about the virus.
[02:22:39.766 --> 02:22:41.127]  They don't actually have it.
[02:22:42.868 --> 02:22:45.190]  It's never been proven to exist.
[02:22:47.131 --> 02:22:51.034]  So when they talk about a mutating strain, a mutating strain of what?
[02:22:52.435 --> 02:22:54.936]  A mutating strain of the story.
[02:22:55.937 --> 02:22:57.278]  That's what they're actually talking
[02:22:58.354 --> 02:23:27.545]  So we're broadcasting today a new mutated strain of the fiction that we began with a year ago when we reported on what was supposedly happening in Wuhan, where, by the way, everybody is celebrating night and day now, having a marvelous time, partying, everything is fabulous, the economy is wide open, and the Chinese are just laughing at the West for buying the fiction, the original fiction,
[02:23:28.223 --> 02:23:29.304]  about the virus.
[02:23:31.445 --> 02:23:32.925]  That was the operation.
[02:23:33.646 --> 02:23:36.247]  That was the covert op, and it still is.
[02:23:37.367 --> 02:23:46.252]  It was the exporting of a story about a lockdown model to the West that Bill Gates was prepared to trumpet.
[02:23:46.912 --> 02:23:51.114]  So was the CDC and the World Health Organization, and that led to all the lockdowns.
[02:23:51.954 --> 02:23:55.536]  So in case there's anybody still out there who really thinks
[02:23:56.929 --> 02:24:01.370]  That the introduction of the vaccine is somehow going to mitigate these lockdowns.
[02:24:02.050 --> 02:24:07.372]  You can now see that that was a pipe dream and a complete fake idea.
[02:24:08.492 --> 02:24:10.352]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:24:11.473 --> 02:24:13.813]  The new normal is meant to be permanent.
[02:24:15.634 --> 02:24:20.235]  And of course, here come these people at the UN and the World Health Organization.
[02:24:21.152 --> 02:24:34.918]  And the CDC and the Coronavirus Task Force, all the little Fauci's, etc, etc, talking about extending lockdowns as if, you know, it's just kind of an irritation.
[02:24:34.998 --> 02:24:36.839]  It's not really a serious problem.
[02:24:37.459 --> 02:24:40.040]  It's not as if we're destroying nations.
[02:24:40.140 --> 02:24:41.001]  Certainly not.
[02:24:42.041 --> 02:24:42.301]  No?
[02:24:43.302 --> 02:24:43.642]  Really?
[02:24:43.662 --> 02:24:47.683]  Their paychecks are secure.
[02:24:47.783 --> 02:24:49.004]  Their money is secure.
[02:24:49.810 --> 02:24:52.272]  It's only everybody else's that's disappearing.
[02:24:55.135 --> 02:24:56.036]  I mean, come on!
[02:24:57.697 --> 02:24:58.218]  Wake up!
[02:24:58.778 --> 02:25:00.780]  Understand what's really going on here.
[02:25:02.081 --> 02:25:04.844]  This is the ramping up of the lockdowns.
[02:25:05.645 --> 02:25:11.470]  This is the perpetuation and acceleration of more lockdowns that you're seeing.
[02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:15.614]  You're seeing in California, you're seeing in New York, you're seeing in other places.
[02:25:16.283 --> 02:25:23.469]  The attempt to do this in Austin now, leading to a firefight between the mayor of Austin and the governor of Texas.
[02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:38.802]  This is all part of the plan to step up the lockdowns, to make them more serious, more destructive, so that businesses that were on the edge of bankruptcy
[02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:55.715]  But thinking of opening and now trying to open, can't open, shut down one more time and now hundreds of thousands of more of these businesses go begging and just enter into total ruins, ashes, destruction.
[02:25:58.478 --> 02:26:03.122]  So only the insane would believe
[02:26:04.648 --> 02:26:11.411]  That the new level of lockdowns is simply an irritation that we have to learn to live with.
[02:26:12.472 --> 02:26:12.732]  No!
[02:26:13.292 --> 02:26:16.634]  It's the complete and utter destruction of the global economy.
[02:26:17.354 --> 02:26:34.043]  It's bringing to a halt the production engine of the planet as the gateway to force everybody into brave new technocratic world of utter wall-to-wall surveillance
[02:26:34.631 --> 02:26:40.534]  Social credit score, currency reset, everybody on the dole, the public dole.
[02:26:42.034 --> 02:26:49.838]  You receive checks that may or may not enable you to survive barely by a hair.
[02:26:51.659 --> 02:27:00.503]  But even if you do, this money, this new money, is meant to control your behavior because if you don't obey and do everything,
[02:27:01.334 --> 02:27:18.065]  That the authorities tell you to do, that the brutal police tell you to do, not only are you going to be isolated and locked down, but your payments are going to be reduced as minimal as they already are, or they'll be wiped out altogether.
[02:27:19.867 --> 02:27:21.868]  That's the reality that is here.
[02:27:23.069 --> 02:27:27.872]  That's the reality that we're seeing taking more solid shape every day.
[02:27:28.713 --> 02:27:30.594]  That's what is actually going on.
[02:27:33.095 --> 02:27:53.686]  And so the mutating strain friggin baloney is just one more pillar being put in place to destroy civilization, to destroy populations, to destroy people, humans, to bring them to their knees.
[02:27:55.888 --> 02:27:58.389]  And there are answers and there are solutions.
[02:27:58.874 --> 02:28:08.037]  But people have to be ready to do something about those solutions and not just say, well, that's not going to work because no, that's not acceptable anymore.
[02:28:08.077 --> 02:28:11.539]  That's not going to work because you've got to consider this and that.
[02:28:11.639 --> 02:28:13.820]  No, no, absolutely not.
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:16.040]  You know, that's a bunch of crap.
[02:28:16.661 --> 02:28:21.442]  There's got to be answers and there are and people have to do something about them.
[02:28:22.483 --> 02:28:23.743]  Stay with us on the other side.
[02:28:23.783 --> 02:28:24.403]  We'll be back.
[02:28:25.104 --> 02:28:25.844]  OK, we're back.
[02:28:26.795 --> 02:28:28.697]  So let's talk about a few solutions.
[02:28:29.377 --> 02:28:33.941]  Let's talk about religious leaders, lawyers, business, small business owners.
[02:28:34.601 --> 02:28:36.322]  And let's start with the religious leaders.
[02:28:36.342 --> 02:28:38.324]  I've talked about this before on the show.
[02:28:39.785 --> 02:28:41.286]  But I want to take it further now.
[02:28:43.248 --> 02:28:45.990]  We have in this country separation of church and state.
[02:28:46.650 --> 02:28:47.851]  That's not an accident.
[02:28:47.911 --> 02:28:50.153]  That was not something that was just an afterthought.
[02:28:50.854 --> 02:28:53.896]  That was serious and it still is serious.
[02:28:55.529 --> 02:29:10.141]  Religious leaders, by whom I mean anybody that has a congregation, a church, a temple, whatever, that has already organization, audience, congregation, members.
[02:29:12.824 --> 02:29:16.967]  They know that their ultimate authority is from God.
[02:29:17.688 --> 02:29:20.810]  That is where they go for ultimate authority.
[02:29:20.850 --> 02:29:22.312]  That's why they have a church.
[02:29:22.832 --> 02:29:24.013]  That's what it's all about.
[02:29:25.490 --> 02:29:41.918]  And are we really to believe that these religious leaders think that their God or their text, their fundamental text, wants lockdowns?
[02:29:42.879 --> 02:29:47.841]  Wants to destroy the right to earn a living as if God is dictating that?
[02:29:48.421 --> 02:29:53.484]  Or is God saying something else about freedom?
[02:29:55.046 --> 02:30:11.411]  About where ultimate loyalty lies, and these religious leaders have to not only say where ultimate loyalty lies to God and not to the state, but it's time to tell their congregations to rebel.
[02:30:12.852 --> 02:30:24.055]  To rebel against the state dictates the destruction of human life, the destruction of the ability to earn a living, the destruction of money,
[02:30:24.582 --> 02:30:39.473]  The destruction of property, the destruction of freedom, all that's going on now, being against God and therefore the right to rebel against the state.
[02:30:41.595 --> 02:30:53.944]  Not only through protests, but in the most fundamental way possible, which is by opening up the economy every which way you can.
[02:30:55.658 --> 02:30:58.019]  I've talked about this several times on the show.
[02:31:00.199 --> 02:31:15.702]  This is the sacred duty of religious leaders in this country and all over the world to tell their congregations to rebel because their highest duty is to God and not to the state.
[02:31:16.342 --> 02:31:22.544]  That has to be clarified and driven home over and over again.
[02:31:23.344 --> 02:31:24.524]  Why are we a church?
[02:31:25.194 --> 02:31:26.415]  Why do we congregate?
[02:31:26.555 --> 02:31:29.557]  Why do we come here in this house of worship?
[02:31:30.177 --> 02:31:35.461]  The rebellion isn't just about the ability to gather and to worship together.
[02:31:37.582 --> 02:31:41.725]  There are churches that have defied the lockdowns on that basis.
[02:31:42.185 --> 02:31:42.565]  Fine.
[02:31:43.006 --> 02:31:44.406]  That's just the beginning of it.
[02:31:44.747 --> 02:31:53.692]  That's not time to sit back and smugly say, well, we have services and they're every Sunday and the people don't wear masks and so everything is peachy keen.
[02:31:53.752 --> 02:31:54.413]  No, it isn't.
[02:31:55.518 --> 02:31:56.299]  No it isn't!
[02:31:57.499 --> 02:32:07.206]  Where is the deeper doctrine and the deeper and higher doctrine of God as opposed to the state?
[02:32:09.428 --> 02:32:11.429]  Where is the understanding of that?
[02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:23.278]  So to say to the congregations, you must rebel in every way possible to reopen
[02:32:24.048 --> 02:32:29.912]  The world to reopen your lives, not just here on Sunday, but everywhere.
[02:32:31.553 --> 02:32:38.217]  To defy the dictates of the state against God.
[02:32:41.519 --> 02:32:43.801]  There was a time when this would have been obvious.
[02:32:44.781 --> 02:32:46.322]  Nobody would say, what is he saying?
[02:32:46.542 --> 02:32:50.625]  Oh, there was a time in every early religion.
[02:32:51.909 --> 02:33:01.811]  Where this would have been obvious, and it was obvious, and that's how these religions survived against the state of their day.
[02:33:01.831 --> 02:33:08.713]  I was recently reading some early history of Christianity under the Roman Empire.
[02:33:08.733 --> 02:33:20.116]  An estimate of two million Christians killed, not just persecuted, but killed for their faith, for their
[02:33:21.380 --> 02:33:22.961]  Duty to God.
[02:33:26.044 --> 02:33:27.565]  So now is that?
[02:33:28.066 --> 02:33:29.627]  Oh, well, that's completely outmoded.
[02:33:29.647 --> 02:33:30.568]  We don't believe in that.
[02:33:30.608 --> 02:33:31.408]  That's ridiculous.
[02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:33.690]  Nobody would ever go to that lengths anymore.
[02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:35.392]  Really?
[02:33:37.153 --> 02:33:37.534]  Why not?
[02:33:39.695 --> 02:33:40.856]  What is God saying?
[02:33:42.298 --> 02:33:43.238]  What is God written?
[02:33:46.421 --> 02:33:49.544]  Why are religious leaders backing away
[02:33:50.686 --> 02:33:53.368]  from saying what is their truth?
[02:33:55.790 --> 02:34:06.819]  Why aren't they saying the command is for all the congregation to rebel on behalf of God against the state?
[02:34:07.860 --> 02:34:12.404]  Not just to have Sunday services, okay?
[02:34:13.064 --> 02:34:16.527]  Not just to be able to gather and pray
[02:34:17.932 --> 02:34:23.674]  Religion is more than Sunday service and gathering to pray.
[02:34:25.434 --> 02:34:27.114]  It was always more than that.
[02:34:27.975 --> 02:34:30.035]  Always a lot more than that.
[02:34:32.536 --> 02:34:47.320]  And as I said the last time I brought this issue up on the show, if the religious leaders, the heads of these congregations, can't bring themselves
[02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:58.544]  to tell their membership that their duty is to rebel against the state, then these leaders should confess that and step down.
[02:35:01.124 --> 02:35:01.685]  Step down.
[02:35:03.605 --> 02:35:04.225]  Move away.
[02:35:05.666 --> 02:35:11.388]  During a service, just say to their congregations, I don't have the courage for this.
[02:35:12.868 --> 02:35:14.649]  I don't have the courage to go
[02:35:15.307 --> 02:35:20.031]  To the length to which I'm supposed to go on behalf of God.
[02:35:21.071 --> 02:35:21.952]  I confess it.
[02:35:23.213 --> 02:35:26.896]  And therefore, I'm stepping down from my position as your leader.
[02:35:27.616 --> 02:35:32.080]  And I'm asking right now here amongst you.
[02:35:33.421 --> 02:35:36.043]  Who is brave enough to take over?
[02:35:37.664 --> 02:35:38.645]  And go all the way.
[02:35:41.227 --> 02:35:44.169]  And if there isn't anybody, that church is done.
[02:35:45.839 --> 02:35:49.702]  If there is, that person takes charge.
[02:35:53.125 --> 02:35:54.626]  It's pretty simple, really.
[02:35:58.529 --> 02:35:59.590]  What is a religion?
[02:36:00.171 --> 02:36:01.612]  What is religious duty?
[02:36:02.072 --> 02:36:10.960]  What is the limit to which a member of a religious congregation is supposed to go?
[02:36:13.362 --> 02:36:14.763]  These are the fundamentals.
[02:36:15.925 --> 02:36:21.987]  This is not just reading and study and learning and worshipping on Sunday and praying.
[02:36:22.007 --> 02:36:38.372]  I mean, if a religion, and we're going back thousands of years in the history of some religion, if these religions, if that's all they were, do you think they would have somehow survived until today?
[02:36:38.992 --> 02:36:45.574]  If they were never about anything more than those superficial realities, do you think, really, they would have survived?
[02:36:46.283 --> 02:36:51.727]  I'm not talking about the buildings and the businesses of the churches.
[02:36:51.767 --> 02:36:55.609]  I'm talking about the memberships, the devotion.
[02:37:00.693 --> 02:37:01.713]  Isn't this obvious?
[02:37:04.655 --> 02:37:06.516]  We're in a titanic struggle here.
[02:37:09.498 --> 02:37:13.361]  It's a test of faith and courage on many levels and many dimensions.
[02:37:18.416 --> 02:37:33.741]  And people have to be awakened to what is happening to us and therefore how far they should be willing to go to defy tyranny.
[02:37:36.061 --> 02:37:45.344]  That's a test of faith that everybody, all of us, faces on some level every day in every way.
[02:37:47.733 --> 02:37:49.614]  It's not just an occasional question.
[02:37:49.694 --> 02:37:53.176]  I don't care who you are, where you are, what you are.
[02:37:53.856 --> 02:38:01.960]  On some level of your consciousness, you're dealing with that question of the test of your own faith and courage every day.
[02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:07.583]  Okay, I want to talk about a couple of other groups here besides the religious leaders.
[02:38:08.523 --> 02:38:16.327]  Let's take a look at the lawyers, especially the constitutional lawyers of which we have in this country untold thousands.
[02:38:17.358 --> 02:38:19.979]  And all over the world, the same.
[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:26.461]  Now, I've met some very good lawyers.
[02:38:27.601 --> 02:38:29.182]  I've met a few great lawyers.
[02:38:30.242 --> 02:38:36.144]  And I've seen a whole lot of lawyers that I wouldn't go near with a 10-foot pole.
[02:38:40.105 --> 02:38:47.107]  But there are enough good lawyers to be filing right now in the US alone.
[02:38:48.357 --> 02:38:53.681]  Literally, thousands of cases in states against the lockdowns.
[02:38:56.143 --> 02:39:10.593]  And again, what I mean by defying the state, rebelling against the state, is primarily, aside from protests, is finding ways to reopen the economy every which way we can.
[02:39:12.134 --> 02:39:15.016]  To go back to life, to go back to freedom, to go back to
[02:39:16.368 --> 02:39:21.312]  The fundamentals as spelled out in the Constitution of the American Republic.
[02:39:23.414 --> 02:39:28.679]  It is those principles that lawyers, especially constitutional lawyers, are familiar with.
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:44.212]  And many of them, many, many, many, many, many, many should be filing now, should have already filed thousands of cases against states for illegal, illegitimate, destructive, unconstitutional lockdowns.
[02:39:47.992 --> 02:39:50.674]  Some of these people say, well, because the cases are not going to work.
[02:39:50.714 --> 02:39:51.575]  So why file them?
[02:39:51.595 --> 02:39:54.898]  Because we know the thing in the court and the judges and that I don't care.
[02:39:55.819 --> 02:39:57.220]  File the cases.
[02:39:58.721 --> 02:40:02.544]  You don't understand how this, how a counter op works.
[02:40:04.426 --> 02:40:13.013]  Simply the filing of these cases, whether they succeed or not, ultimately can create the
[02:40:14.105 --> 02:40:20.090]  Leveraged into publicity on behalf of what is right and good and true and constitutional.
[02:40:21.712 --> 02:40:42.249]  And if you have thousands of these cases being filed and more coming in every day, the accumulation of this wisdom and truth and relentless capacity to embolden the original meaning of the Constitution begins to have an effect on the mind of the public and everybody.
[02:40:43.746 --> 02:40:46.308]  Regardless of outcome of these cases.
[02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:51.353]  So the familiar excuse that's always wheeled out there.
[02:40:51.373 --> 02:40:56.837]  Well, the case is not really going to work because you see the technical issue comes down to this and so forth.
[02:40:57.178 --> 02:40:59.480]  And then we got the precedence of so far cases.
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:01.121]  I don't care about any of that.
[02:41:01.361 --> 02:41:03.443]  Okay, that's all a bunch of crap.
[02:41:04.824 --> 02:41:11.430]  Lawyers who understand the Constitution know at the most fundamental level, this whole COVID operation is entirely
[02:41:12.188 --> 02:41:15.189]  Fascistic, tyrannical, and destructive of the Constitution.
[02:41:15.589 --> 02:41:37.532]  Because if you destroy a person's ability to work and earn a living, and destroy that right and that freedom, then you tell me what other freedoms spelled out in the Constitution still have any meaning whatsoever and are not completely null and void, okay?
[02:41:38.533 --> 02:41:38.993]  Come on!
[02:41:39.573 --> 02:41:40.053]  Wake up!
[02:41:40.233 --> 02:41:40.873]  Realize it!
[02:41:41.437 --> 02:41:43.239]  I'm talking to the lawyers now.
[02:41:43.879 --> 02:41:56.950]  What was your original impetus when you were young and free and still believed in something before you put it all aside for money and deals and this and that and technical issues?
[02:41:57.031 --> 02:42:01.675]  And, oh, we have to be talking to our own colleagues and we have to be talking to the media.
[02:42:01.715 --> 02:42:03.076]  We're not talking to the people.
[02:42:03.396 --> 02:42:04.277]  Yes, you are.
[02:42:05.888 --> 02:42:07.569]  The people depend on you.
[02:42:08.050 --> 02:42:22.741]  That's what you wanted when you were 17 years old and you still cared about life, about reality, about the fundamental brilliance of the Constitution as an idea that was put into action.
[02:42:26.284 --> 02:42:28.666]  Restore that faith.
[02:42:29.306 --> 02:42:31.088]  File those cases.
[02:42:31.628 --> 02:42:34.891]  There is no Constitution if the state can
[02:42:35.746 --> 02:42:48.889]  At its whim, declare states of emergency illegally and then not be forced in court to justify those states on the basis of fact and merit and science.
[02:42:49.689 --> 02:42:53.911]  You take that away, you destroy the entire foundation of a country.
[02:42:54.931 --> 02:42:55.611]  Because then,
[02:42:56.348 --> 02:43:00.311]  This day can come along and say, well, we have this state of emergency and we got that one.
[02:43:00.652 --> 02:43:02.433]  And here's another one we have to declare.
[02:43:02.793 --> 02:43:09.679]  And so this is another reason why we have to lock you down and we can't let you out of the house and we can't let you open your business.
[02:43:12.681 --> 02:43:15.203]  We have to destroy your business.
[02:43:17.105 --> 02:43:17.425]  I mean.
[02:43:18.666 --> 02:43:19.467]  The founders.
[02:43:20.057 --> 02:43:37.070]  Never thought that they needed to embed a clause in the Constitution that would explicitly prevent the central government from destroying a business owner's business or destroying the worker's right to work and earn a living.
[02:43:37.651 --> 02:43:42.355]  It never occurred to them that such a thing would ever be done to the population.
[02:43:43.095 --> 02:43:44.596]  But it's being done now.
[02:43:45.397 --> 02:43:46.578]  It's being done now.
[02:43:47.924 --> 02:43:57.907]  And implicit in the Constitution, as any idiot or fool can see, is the right to own a business, to work, to earn a living.
[02:43:58.328 --> 02:44:03.569]  Because again, if you take that right out and remove it, what are you left with?
[02:44:04.109 --> 02:44:06.150]  No rights, no freedoms, nothing.
[02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:14.173]  The entire Constitution, just light a match and burn it up and make an end of it and say, we are all fascists.
[02:44:14.453 --> 02:44:16.274]  We are all tyranny.
[02:44:16.454 --> 02:44:17.614]  We are all destruction.
[02:44:19.699 --> 02:44:26.625]  It's the lawyers that have to step up to the plate, along with the religious leaders, and file cases.
[02:44:28.526 --> 02:44:31.729]  It should take 24 hours to write up a filing.
[02:44:32.349 --> 02:44:36.512]  Don't give me, oh, six weeks and we have to refer to this and that and the other thing.
[02:44:37.053 --> 02:44:38.854]  I've seen filings.
[02:44:39.475 --> 02:44:40.656]  I know what they're about.
[02:44:42.537 --> 02:44:45.780]  You can pull one out of your hat in 24 hours and file it.
[02:44:48.689 --> 02:45:00.934]  And it's going to be news if hundreds and more hundreds and more hundreds and thousands of cases against the lockdowns are filed in America and other countries, as they should be, as they must be.
[02:45:01.334 --> 02:45:09.338]  This is not something, oh, this is a pipe dream, Rappaport is concocting, you know, just in order to say that there's maybe an answer.
[02:45:09.638 --> 02:45:11.899]  No, this is a necessity.
[02:45:11.919 --> 02:45:16.581]  This is a necessity for any country
[02:45:16.991 --> 02:45:24.494]  That has any shred of freedom embedded in it whatsoever in its founding documents, in its laws.
[02:45:26.154 --> 02:45:41.680]  That there be thousands of cases piled upon thousands more filed every day against the state for the illegitimate and destructive and inhumane and murderous friggin' lockdowns.
[02:45:44.088 --> 02:45:45.289]  That is reality.
[02:45:45.829 --> 02:45:50.753]  Not all this other crap, but well, we don't know, we're not sure, and the technical issue, and then there was a precedent case in 1873.
[02:45:51.413 --> 02:45:53.554]  That's not reality.
[02:45:55.115 --> 02:46:01.700]  That's everything put up there to deny looking at one's own test of faith and courage.
[02:46:03.021 --> 02:46:09.505]  We move that out of the way, and what we're left with is the reality of the necessity of filing these cases.
[02:46:12.116 --> 02:46:23.158]  And finally, when we come to the small and medium-sized business owners who are being beaten over the head, left and right, in every possible way and direction, they have to organize.
[02:46:25.118 --> 02:46:27.119]  They have to become powerful entities.
[02:46:27.959 --> 02:46:39.681]  Bar owners associations, restaurant owners associations, hair salon associations, barbershop associations, shoe repair owner associations, and on and on and on.
[02:46:40.530 --> 02:46:49.878]  Many associations because in this case what we're faced with is strength in numbers.
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:56.464]  I've seen the heartbreaking heroic videos like you have.
[02:46:57.384 --> 02:47:04.468]  Of the bar owner who stands up to the authorities as the fines of over several thousand a day are ringing up against him.
[02:47:04.808 --> 02:47:14.273]  And he's saying to the camera, we're going to do everything we can to stay open because we know this locks down is is unconstitutional and destroying life.
[02:47:14.813 --> 02:47:17.955]  And we want to stand up to it and so on and so forth.
[02:47:18.915 --> 02:47:25.539]  And this guy and his friends are, you know, they're drowning in a sea of trouble brought on by
[02:47:26.601 --> 02:47:28.382]  Vicious, murderous governors.
[02:47:31.504 --> 02:47:33.146]  So there is strength in numbers.
[02:47:34.266 --> 02:47:35.848]  I mean, it's just necessity.
[02:47:37.088 --> 02:47:43.973]  This bar owner has to get together with other bar owners who get together with other bar owners and form an association.
[02:47:45.815 --> 02:47:51.979]  So that when they stand up, they are standing up as many, not one.
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:56.202]  And there are ways to get publicity for this.
[02:47:57.916 --> 02:48:13.093]  And impress it on people's minds that there are many of these associations that are against the lockdowns and defying the lockdowns and opening up the economy and changing what's happening before us.
[02:48:14.234 --> 02:48:14.835]  Many thanks.
[02:48:15.756 --> 02:48:17.237]  John Rappaport, see you next time.
[02:48:27.421 --> 02:48:35.144]  The year 2021 is now here and world government and the New World Order and their post-human agenda is out in the open.
[02:48:35.825 --> 02:48:42.948]  It's now more important than ever that all of you realize that the fact that you're awake and you're informed and you're involved means you're the brain trust.
[02:48:42.988 --> 02:48:48.210]  You're the tip of the spear that understands what's really going on in the planet and the globalists fear you.
[02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:53.372]  That's why they've been trying to censor you and silence you and silence organizations like InfoWars
[02:48:54.721 --> 02:49:00.308]  Where those of us who understand what's happening are able to congregate, share information, and move against their operation.
[02:49:00.929 --> 02:49:03.472]  Their plan is very diabolical and over-the-top evil.
[02:49:03.873 --> 02:49:09.180]  But if people are simply informed about it and resist it, it can and will, and really must be defeated.
[02:49:10.404 --> 02:49:14.125]  Now in that fight, we fund ourselves by selling products directly to the public.
[02:49:14.205 --> 02:49:18.947]  Because as you know, the globalists shut down and boycott all of their opposition.
[02:49:19.267 --> 02:49:22.108]  But we've built the model of resistance that can take them down.
[02:49:22.488 --> 02:49:26.030]  Because you are supporting us and buying products directly from M4 Wars.
[02:49:26.910 --> 02:49:28.130]  Now I've gotten a lot of complaints.
[02:49:28.531 --> 02:49:33.992]  Thousands of them saying in the last eight months or so, a lot of our favorite products are unavailable.
[02:49:34.093 --> 02:49:34.413]  Why?
[02:49:35.553 --> 02:49:37.774]  That's because of the COVID lockdown, not COVID.
[02:49:38.536 --> 02:49:42.177]  Many of the proprietary, patented ingredients in our products were unavailable.
[02:49:42.237 --> 02:49:43.218]  Warehouses were shut down.
[02:49:43.298 --> 02:49:44.058]  Factories were shut down.
[02:49:44.378 --> 02:49:53.161]  And so for eight months, one of our most popular products, Pollen Block, to deal with seasonal irritations and the rest of it, is back in stock.
[02:49:53.721 --> 02:49:56.702]  And so is activated charcoal toothpaste.
[02:49:57.659 --> 02:50:00.060]  Both of these are in our Top 10 Best Sellers.
[02:50:00.581 --> 02:50:01.501]  They've been unavailable.
[02:50:01.902 --> 02:50:03.022]  This one for about 4 months.
[02:50:03.743 --> 02:50:06.204]  Pollen Block for, again, 8 plus months.
[02:50:06.625 --> 02:50:09.606]  And we only got a quarter of the shipment that we tried to get.
[02:50:10.247 --> 02:50:11.768]  Because, again, things are breaking down.
[02:50:12.008 --> 02:50:13.149]  These proprietary products.
[02:50:13.209 --> 02:50:14.049]  Look into Pollen Block.
[02:50:14.069 --> 02:50:14.970]  Why it's so special.
[02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:16.110]  Why it's so amazing.
[02:50:16.511 --> 02:50:23.055]  And check out our Concentrated Activated Charcoal Toothpaste as well that my dad, a dentist, designed at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:50:23.335 --> 02:50:25.096]  Get yours today and thank you all for your support.
