[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.413]  So is Trump having a sympathetic response to a regular cold or flu going around the White House?
[00:00:06.594 --> 00:00:07.595]  Is it a false test?
[00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:09.197]  Has he been poisoned?
[00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:11.699]  Will they say he died of COVID or he died of something else?
[00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.360]  That's how I do it.
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.641]  That's the easiest way.
[00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:19.265]  You just poison him right after you say he has the positive COVID test.
[00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.126]  Because they're going around testing the whole White House all the time.
[00:00:21.947 --> 00:00:22.648]  And so, oh boom!
[00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:23.728]  Test positive.
[00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:25.710]  9 out of 10 tests are fake.
[00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.692]  Now they're slipping.
[00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:29.354]  I don't know.
[00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:47.744]  Obviously, there's more threats to the president than any other president combined.
[00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:49.545]  Obviously, poison's the way they want to go.
[00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:55.227]  They're always saying he's 74, overweight, he's going to have a heart attack, he has a medical checkup, it's the end of the world.
[00:00:56.168 --> 00:00:58.869]  What they'll do is say he has COVID and poison him with something else.
[00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.191]  Or give him weaponized COVID, because it's a carrier platform, and do it.
[00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:05.812]  I mean, this is a big deal 31 days out.
[00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.372]  And I told you this was all coming.
[00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.854]  And already the COVID shutdown is annihilating the worldwide economy.
[00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:13.715]  I mean, stuff is serious!
[00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:19.300]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:25.150]  It's Friday, October 2nd.
[00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.171]  The year is 2020.
[00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:30.413]  We are 32 days out from the election.
[00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:37.977]  The deep state Democrats have said they will contest and they will try to drive the country into civil war, balkanization, and even secession.
[00:01:38.657 --> 00:01:46.762]  And right on time, we learned that President Trump has tested positive for COVID-19 and so has his wife, Melania.
[00:01:48.544 --> 00:01:49.645]  Now let's talk about this.
[00:01:49.985 --> 00:02:00.052]  Many times I have said that one scenario would be the president getting COVID-19 near the election date and they could use that to try to put him under house arrest.
[00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:06.776]  How can the president, again, be put under quarantine and made to stay in one spot for 14 days?
[00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:17.403]  It's simply outrageous and it's part of the paralyzation of our economy where one person has COVID-19 in a meatpacking plant or a warehouse and they shut the whole thing down when the facts are 100% clear.
[00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:30.454]  COVID-19 has a lower death rate than the flu by many magnitudes when you take out the comorbidities of 94% of the people that died of COVID-19 really died of something else.
[00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:33.436]  But that's the facts and they don't want the facts to get in the way.
[00:02:33.877 --> 00:02:42.304]  All over Fox, CNN, oh we told you so, those of you that say COVID-19's a hoax, well you see that Trump and Melania have it.
[00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:46.632]  So it's always about there being more cases, not there being more deaths.
[00:02:46.672 --> 00:02:59.818]  But now that fall is here, and now that winter is coming, and people are indoors not getting vitamin D3 from the sun, you're going to see the regular flu deaths, the pneumonia deaths, the cold deaths of old people that will be put in the COVID-19 column.
[00:03:00.258 --> 00:03:02.319]  But here's the big takeaway, and here's some of the articles.
[00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.839]  They're at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.560]  We'll break down more in the next segment.
[00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:10.042]  No one else asked this question as of us publishing this about an hour ago.
[00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:10.702]  No one.
[00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:11.262]  I searched it.
[00:03:11.282 --> 00:03:12.463]  I got up at 4.30 this morning.
[00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.782]  My phone was ringing off the hook.
[00:03:15.702 --> 00:03:23.166]  I'd gone to sleep last night, had missed Trump's tweet at like 11.55, that he and Melania had tested positive, supposedly, for COVID-19.
[00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:29.309]  I wake up 4.30, my phone is loaded with text messages and calls saying, President Trump and Melania have COVID-19.
[00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.169]  No, they've tested positive for it.
[00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.150]  So I searched.
[00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.791]  Hey, is it a false positive?
[00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:44.997]  No one even asked that question until Paul Joseph Watson and I put this article out on Infowars.com, which is scary because remember, you'd hear whole football teams had it and it was all false positives.
[00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:46.318]  Remember that?
[00:03:46.378 --> 00:03:49.060]  Or you'd hear a whole school had it and they were all false positives.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.481]  Even the New York Times had to admit that.
[00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:53.798]  Upwards of 90% of the tests are false positives.
[00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:54.559]  Simply incredible.
[00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.280]  So here's the headline.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.483]  Could Trump's coronavirus test be a false positive?
[00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:01.226]  And it goes over the history and the evidence of it.
[00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:02.788]  What an important article.
[00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.209]  We'll cover more next segment.
[00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.711]  Meanwhile, you knew this was coming.
[00:04:06.592 --> 00:04:10.115]  Leftists claim Trump faked his coronavirus infection.
[00:04:11.156 --> 00:04:12.957]  And I think it's fine to always question things.
[00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:14.158]  Does he have a motive?
[00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:16.259]  Does he want to be locked down for 14 days?
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:25.245]  The deep state and Democrats have used COVID-19 to keep things locked down and the economy to try to stop Trump rallies, but their BLM rallies and other rallies are supposedly okay.
[00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:29.008]  Trump does not have a motive to say he has COVID-19.
[00:04:29.048 --> 00:04:32.370]  I'll talk about what I believe has probably happened more in the next segment, but
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:44.427]  Democrats are certainly welcome, and I think it's reasonable to question any government official, any agency, any corporation, any big group, or any individual, and say, there's a history of lying.
[00:04:44.807 --> 00:04:48.029]  There's a history of people staging that they've been attacked, or that they're sick.
[00:04:48.349 --> 00:05:02.638]  And so it's totally reasonable, with all the fake folks that say they have cancer, that do GoFundMes, and all the babies in incubators being killed by Saddam that didn't exist, and all the Jussie Smollett's, and all the Bubba Wallace's, and all of that going on,
[00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:16.990]  To say, did Trump stage this to get sympathy, to make himself look human, to counter-strike against all those that say he's the guy that ignored COVID so he made it worse than it was, but now that he's got it, he's one of us.
[00:05:17.631 --> 00:05:20.513]  I've looked at the calculus and I don't believe that that's what happened.
[00:05:20.573 --> 00:05:21.394]  This hurts Trump.
[00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:22.415]  It doesn't help Trump.
[00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:23.856]  Plus, I know how Trump operates.
[00:05:24.497 --> 00:05:28.019]  He is neurotically pragmatic and by the book.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.823]  I mean, just extremely, almost to an autistic level in a good way.
[00:05:32.163 --> 00:05:35.105]  And Trump knows he can't trust people around him, even if he was corrupt.
[00:05:35.506 --> 00:05:41.951]  He's not gonna pull some fake thing like this and have others in on it when they're leaking information and it would surely come out.
[00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:42.311]  No.
[00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:46.455]  This man is an island, if any man ever was, and he knows that.
[00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:47.796]  It's Friday, October 2nd, 2020.
[00:05:47.836 --> 00:05:49.257]  We're 32 days out from the election.
[00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:28.086]  And we've got exclusive, beyond bombshell, game-changing, world-event-defining, chill-up-and-down-the-back-of-your-spine-level information.
[00:06:28.186 --> 00:06:45.090]  If people will just listen to me, and if we can just get Tucker Carlson to talk about this, and Sean Hannity, and Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck, and Senator Cruz, and Senator Paul, especially Medical Doctor, we can save America and the world.
[00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:50.876]  You knew there'd be a dirty trick 30-something days out from the election.
[00:06:51.577 --> 00:07:04.712]  And I'm on record, the crew's digging it up, we'll have it later in the broadcast, here on this Friday edition, where I said they could use a false positive COVID test on the president to lock him down, and that I predicted they'd do it in and around the election.
[00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:08.119]  I also said they could give him a weaponized strain.
[00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:12.260]  When I came in this morning, the crew reminded me of that, and again, they're digging it out.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.640]  But look, that's just a scenario.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.301]  That's just analysis of a probability, of a possibility, knowing the MO.
[00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:19.822]  It doesn't matter.
[00:07:21.662 --> 00:07:26.223]  Listen to me very, very, very, very carefully.
[00:07:27.724 --> 00:07:31.905]  Not only do we have proof that this is almost certainly a false positive, and I'll present it in a moment,
[00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:48.364]  But then if we don't get Trump to understand that, and if he goes the Boris Johnson victim route and plays along with it, it will only help intensify the lockdown and let the deep state blame Trump for the COVID-19 deaths, which are really China's fault that they've already been hyping.
[00:07:48.564 --> 00:07:54.488]  So let me break down this political calculus, this political trigonometry, if you want to win.
[00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:56.469]  Now let's get into it right now.
[00:07:58.322 --> 00:07:59.984]  These articles are on Infowars.com.
[00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:01.145]  They've got all the links proving it.
[00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:03.587]  Then I'll go over the actual original articles for you right after that.
[00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:08.492]  Could Trump's coronavirus test be a false positive?
[00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:11.655]  Paul Joseph Watson, Alex Jones, Infowars.com.
[00:08:12.996 --> 00:08:19.202]  As of 6 o'clock in the morning when we got this article out, no one else had asked the question, even though it came out last night.
[00:08:20.823 --> 00:08:22.345]  It's not about us being cutting edge.
[00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:23.065]  That's scary.
[00:08:23.948 --> 00:08:31.754]  Whole football teams, I'll show you the articles, and whole groups of sports teams would test positive, and then they'd go get tested again, and they'd all be negative.
[00:08:32.454 --> 00:08:34.596]  But they'd make them get two more tests to prove it.
[00:08:34.896 --> 00:08:35.696]  Three in a row.
[00:08:36.377 --> 00:08:37.958]  Some teams, four in a row.
[00:08:38.238 --> 00:08:38.799]  Five in a row.
[00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:40.500]  I'll show you the articles, but you remember that.
[00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:45.624]  So, they now admit 90% of the average tests are false positive.
[00:08:45.804 --> 00:08:49.987]  The new rapid reaction test that Trump got convinced to put out, that the White House uses?
[00:08:51.288 --> 00:08:54.150]  They're saying they may be like 98% false positive.
[00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.072]  So, think about that.
[00:08:57.092 --> 00:09:04.898]  This is all hidden in plain view, that almost everyone is false positive, but on this test, we don't even hear, let's get a second opinion.
[00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:06.665]  That's the first thing you do.
[00:09:06.685 --> 00:09:10.566]  They tell you you have cancer or you've got something else or you've got a venereal disease.
[00:09:10.586 --> 00:09:11.446]  You go get a second opinion.
[00:09:11.686 --> 00:09:21.628]  They're telling the most important person in the world, the leader of the free world, that he's got something and he's got to just go away for 14 days in the homestretch of a campaign and kill his ground game.
[00:09:22.388 --> 00:09:23.968]  This helps America's enemies.
[00:09:24.028 --> 00:09:27.269]  And China is laughing at us saying, oh, look, it's our fault.
[00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:30.089]  The Democrats are calling it the Trump virus.
[00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:34.310]  And no one in his own campaign is getting other doctors in.
[00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:36.009]  We're good to go.
[00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.451]  Well, how did he fake it if they went and tested him?
[00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:13.977]  But there's a kernel of truth there, because if almost all these tests are false positive, if 9 out of 10 times they're false positive, well then, you'd be reasonable to say it's a fake test.
[00:10:13.997 --> 00:10:19.901]  90% chance, conservatively, it is a false positive, but asking that question is evil and horrible, and the media spins it.
[00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:22.902]  Well, Jones is saying COVID-19's a hoax.
[00:10:22.962 --> 00:10:23.362]  No, it's not.
[00:10:24.043 --> 00:10:29.406]  It's a man-made virus, game of function, Fauci, Bill Gates, even mainstream news, Newsweek, AP reported.
[00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:33.008]  So they can own it and patent it and control it, and there are worse strains out there.
[00:10:33.308 --> 00:10:35.510]  But compared to many other flus and things, it's not that deadly.
[00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:52.000]  But it does spread, so people get tested positive, so they can then be identified and be told they've got to be contact traced, got to have apps on your phone, got to have a social credit score, got to shut society down, got to bring in the carbon tax, got to have the Great Reset the Davos Group is openly talking about.
[00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:54.967]  Do I think Trump staged this?
[00:10:55.007 --> 00:10:55.147]  No.
[00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:55.948]  This hurts Trump.
[00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.591]  This hurts the recovery.
[00:10:57.671 --> 00:10:58.573]  This hurts America.
[00:10:58.593 --> 00:11:02.439]  This helped shut him down with just 32 days left.
[00:11:02.479 --> 00:11:05.765]  Now let's go into those articles that I just mentioned.
[00:11:06.085 --> 00:11:07.127]  These are all mainstream news.
[00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:13.169]  Up to 90% of those who tested positive for COVID-19 wrongly diagnosed.
[00:11:13.909 --> 00:11:17.051]  And even Lancet Medical Journal is saying that.
[00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:22.494]  Trump administration's new rapid coronavirus test plagued by confusion and lack of planning.
[00:11:22.894 --> 00:11:26.776]  Washington Post, and it says most of them are false positives.
[00:11:27.176 --> 00:11:28.017]  Here's the New York Times.
[00:11:28.917 --> 00:11:30.398]  Your coronavirus test is positive.
[00:11:30.598 --> 00:11:31.579]  Maybe it shouldn't be.
[00:11:32.594 --> 00:11:35.276]  And they say in here upwards of 90% or more are false positives.
[00:11:35.936 --> 00:11:47.265]  Chinese state media gloats about Trump catching coronavirus, but really what he did is he got tested with something that... Let's say if 9 times out of 10 you won the lottery, you didn't really win.
[00:11:47.985 --> 00:11:52.829]  Would them announcing you won the lottery mean you won if 9 times out of 10 it turned out it wasn't a win?
[00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:54.150]  You'd be like, oh no!
[00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:56.692]  They've got a 10% chance of winning the lottery.
[00:11:57.192 --> 00:11:57.973]  It's the same thing here.
[00:11:59.053 --> 00:12:00.294]  It's total fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:02.034]  90% chance it's a false positive.
[00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:04.295]  But where's the talk of more tests?
[00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:05.016]  It's the President.
[00:12:05.356 --> 00:12:06.456]  We want more tests.
[00:12:06.756 --> 00:12:07.777]  We want a blood test.
[00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:08.617]  We want it now.
[00:12:10.038 --> 00:12:10.538]  Continuing.
[00:12:10.598 --> 00:12:16.080]  Connecticut State Lab finds 90% false positives out of 144 coronavirus tests administered in mid-June.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.401]  I just have dozens of articles.
[00:12:18.622 --> 00:12:23.764]  NFL has 77 apparently false positive COVID-19 tests from the lab.
[00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.053]  Thousands of Swedes got false COVID-19 results due to test kit fault.
[00:12:32.034 --> 00:12:36.558]  California will soon be paying $1,350 to people who test positive for coronavirus.
[00:12:36.778 --> 00:12:38.579]  That just incentivizes this whole damn thing.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.743]  Rhode Island received 113 false positive COVID-19 test results from private lab.
[00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.705]  I mean, these are just the articles I printed before we went live here.
[00:12:47.406 --> 00:12:47.946]  This is nothing.
[00:12:49.517 --> 00:12:49.877]  This is nothing.
[00:12:50.017 --> 00:12:53.798]  There's articles where hundreds of labs in Florida all said 100% positive.
[00:12:53.838 --> 00:12:55.919]  Turned out they didn't even test the people.
[00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:01.760]  Former FDA commissioner says coronavirus antibody tests are returning tons of false positives.
[00:13:03.381 --> 00:13:09.182]  Musk urges COVID-19 results to ridiculous number of false positives.
[00:13:11.863 --> 00:13:15.004]  Three Titans players, five personal test positive for COVID-19,
[00:13:16.417 --> 00:13:17.977]  Suspend in-person activities.
[00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:21.238]  And then, of course, it turned out they didn't really have COVID-19.
[00:13:22.318 --> 00:13:25.599]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:27.620]  And people are getting upset about this.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.300]  People are getting mad about this.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.781]  America is in a war for its very survival.
[00:13:33.121 --> 00:13:40.143]  And now our president battling against the communist Chinese, the globalists, and others in an open worldwide economic war.
[00:13:41.584 --> 00:13:47.612]  Is being told he's got to stay locked up for 14 days, legitimizing this entire giant fraud.
[00:13:48.857 --> 00:13:52.038]  What we know is 90% of the tests are false positive conservatively.
[00:13:52.718 --> 00:13:57.120]  What we know is there are people inside the White House that want to lock the President down.
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.221]  There have been all these coup plans by people in the White House.
[00:14:00.241 --> 00:14:02.042]  You had Mattis trying to organize a coup.
[00:14:02.602 --> 00:14:07.924]  And I said all along, one way to do it with this COVID-19 is to give him a false positive test.
[00:14:08.364 --> 00:14:10.505]  They could then poison his Diet Coke or something.
[00:14:10.805 --> 00:14:13.166]  He gets really sick and they said it's COVID-19.
[00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:17.188]  So I would also advise the Secret Service to be extra diligent about
[00:14:18.373 --> 00:14:24.718]  What the president ingest, because they could now use COVID as the cover to kill the president.
[00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:31.083]  If you simply look at this from a Machiavellian view and start studying the different angles, historically, it's very, very serious.
[00:14:31.123 --> 00:14:44.853]  Another reason COVID-19 is so important, and it's not a hoax in that it does kill people, is that it's a classic chimera, five species virus, man-made, all the top scientists, the discoverer of HIV, Nobel Prize winners, they've all come out, it's confirmed.
[00:14:45.293 --> 00:14:46.955]  And the media tries to censor that because it's true.
[00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:55.435]  It was developed as a whole group of viruses that you can then manipulate and weaponize at any time.
[00:14:56.431 --> 00:14:59.372]  So it has incredible gain of function, HIV delivery system.
[00:14:59.412 --> 00:15:02.572]  Doesn't give you HIV, but has the delivery system through your mucous membranes.
[00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:10.374]  And so it's a very dangerous weaponized virus in that it has incredible gain of function, but imagine it is the missile that carries the payload.
[00:15:10.814 --> 00:15:18.376]  Most of the strains are not very dangerous, not very bad if you have your zinc, your vitamin D3, and of course your vitamin C, as Fauci's been forced to say.
[00:15:19.542 --> 00:15:21.828]  Those are the upfront therapeutics people need.
[00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.578]  We're going to come back in the next segment and break down the next shoe to drop.
[00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:28.345]  I'm Alex Jones, spread the word, InfoWars.com.
[00:15:29.892 --> 00:15:30.452]  Welcome back.
[00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:32.253]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:15:32.754 --> 00:15:38.277]  I'll be back in studio coming up a little bit later, but David Knight is really extremely well-researched.
[00:15:38.297 --> 00:15:49.024]  He's an engineer into all the COVID-19 fraud, all the different scams, the exaggerations, the dead people put on lists as dying of COVID-19, the gain of function, the test being false positive.
[00:15:49.064 --> 00:15:51.686]  He's going to be in studio with Owen Schroer.
[00:15:52.626 --> 00:15:55.911]  Coming up, and then Owen's going to continue into the second hour.
[00:15:55.931 --> 00:16:01.720]  Then we have a medical doctor coming on, a great lady who's been exposing the COVID-19 power grab.
[00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.144]  She's going to be joining us on air as well.
[00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:07.389]  But let me show you one more story before I get into the election itself.
[00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:22.401]  Remember all the meat packing plants and other shipping facilities, warehouses, where you'd have 2,000 employees, 3,000 employees, 4,000 employees, and they would test them all, and in some cases, half of them would test positive, but none of them were sick and they were asymptomatic.
[00:16:23.407 --> 00:16:28.572]  Well, some of them had COVID-19, but it didn't make them sick, because they had their vitamins and minerals and nutrients.
[00:16:28.952 --> 00:16:32.035]  But the others, it turned out, were false positives, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:32.235 --> 00:16:33.276]  In fact, the vast majority.
[00:16:33.636 --> 00:16:35.518]  Yet again, remember all of that.
[00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:36.739]  But what does this do?
[00:16:36.819 --> 00:16:40.642]  It shuts down our industry, makes our economy collapse, and when we collapse...
[00:16:41.618 --> 00:16:42.539]  The third world dies.
[00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:47.242]  So it's not heroic to sit there and say, oh, I'm going to wear my mask.
[00:16:47.342 --> 00:16:48.203]  Oh, I'm not going to go out.
[00:16:48.303 --> 00:16:49.504]  Oh, I'm going to stay home.
[00:16:49.524 --> 00:16:57.609]  Oh, I'm going to live on welfare because that is going to bring us into an unending depression, which is what the Davos group, the top banks want to make us dependent on them.
[00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.271]  They want a post-industrial world.
[00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:00.591]  They don't want you self-sufficient.
[00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:02.653]  They don't want you to be able to take care of yourself.
[00:17:02.873 --> 00:17:05.095]  They want a guaranteed universal income.
[00:17:06.414 --> 00:17:11.318]  So they can dictate to you how you live your life, what your politics are, and what you can and can't do.
[00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:16.582]  That's why major cycling stars that just say, yeah, I like Trump, get fired off their team.
[00:17:17.723 --> 00:17:19.825]  You're not even allowed in America to say you like Trump.
[00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:21.586]  Imagine this into the future.
[00:17:21.786 --> 00:17:22.487]  Well, you're a Christian.
[00:17:22.507 --> 00:17:23.428]  Sorry, you can't have a bank account.
[00:17:23.628 --> 00:17:24.248]  Can't have a job.
[00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:25.710]  Oh, you're a gun store owner.
[00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.610]  You can't have a bank account.
[00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.171]  Can't have a job.
[00:17:27.391 --> 00:17:28.212]  It's already here.
[00:17:29.468 --> 00:17:30.589]  That's Trump's greatest failing.
[00:17:30.629 --> 00:17:39.915]  It's not standing up against the censorship and the harassment of Christians and conservatives in America and patriots that has not been seen since the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[00:17:40.855 --> 00:17:44.758]  I mean, in Nazi Germany, under Lenin, they targeted Christians.
[00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:53.023]  Under Hitler, they targeted Jews and others, and they would shut down their bank accounts, their businesses, and their lives to then impoverish them and then finally kill them.
[00:17:53.624 --> 00:17:54.484]  Well, here it is.
[00:17:54.825 --> 00:17:57.967]  Americans increasingly believe violence is justified
[00:17:59.247 --> 00:18:00.267]  The other side wins.
[00:18:00.407 --> 00:18:06.089]  Well, that's what the Democrats have been preparing, but they can't beat us politically, so they want to beat us by having a civil war.
[00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:17.533]  And a lot of states like Michigan and Pennsylvania have had rulings that they can just keep the election open indefinitely, bring in the 20th Amendment, and have Nancy Pelosi and the House of Representatives elect who the president is.
[00:18:17.793 --> 00:18:25.916]  But we've had some victories, two huge court rulings in GOP, Maine blocks illegal Democrat, ballot harvesting, Texas blocks straight party ballot option.
[00:18:27.153 --> 00:18:28.595]  So all of that is happening as well?
[00:18:29.115 --> 00:18:37.245]  And what are they trying to cover up with America sucks and America's behind COVID-19 and Communist China's cheerleading and saying Trump's the bad guy?
[00:18:37.966 --> 00:18:38.727]  News like this story.
[00:18:39.696 --> 00:18:40.096]  Huge!
[00:18:40.236 --> 00:18:40.497]  U.S.
[00:18:40.557 --> 00:18:46.181]  Marshal Service announces rescue of more than 1,300 missing children, including victims of sex trafficking.
[00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:50.725]  Trump has doubled the number of rescues just in the last year.
[00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:57.630]  And that's what Hunter Biden, and that's what John Podesta, and that's what Hillary Clinton, and Laura Silsby,
[00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:11.881]  And all these people are so concerned about, because they know the Brothman sex cult, the NXIVM devil cult, all of it, John of God, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates involved with Jeffrey Epstein, they know it's all coming down.
[00:19:12.141 --> 00:19:23.170]  But to recap this, if the vast majority of the tests are false positive, with the four types of tests there are, and we've learned this, that's why the death rate isn't high, but the testing positive rate is high.
[00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.733]  It's not about getting sick now, it's about, oh you have it, and oh you don't want to get it.
[00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:30.041]  And so again, Trump must be multiple tested.
[00:19:30.341 --> 00:19:32.222]  He must have independent outside groups do it.
[00:19:32.542 --> 00:19:33.963]  I don't trust the people in the White House.
[00:19:34.203 --> 00:19:35.504]  They've proven to be double agents.
[00:19:36.345 --> 00:19:37.866]  We've got to get the message out to the President.
[00:19:38.346 --> 00:19:39.367]  He needs to be tested again.
[00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:42.349]  And that he shouldn't be locked down during this campaign.
[00:19:42.689 --> 00:19:43.550]  This is siege.
[00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.171]  This is manipulation.
[00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:51.435]  This is the shutdown of the campaign, of the President, of everyone, and now it's got them saying Trump said it was a hoax.
[00:19:51.675 --> 00:19:52.576]  He never said it was a hoax.
[00:19:53.236 --> 00:19:56.639]  He said the hoax was saying 2.5 million would die.
[00:19:57.711 --> 00:20:02.233]  The hoax was saying that the hospitals were all going to be filled and we had to shut the economy completely down.
[00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:09.896]  The hoax was them saying that Trump didn't shut down flights from China when they were the ones saying don't shut down the flights from China.
[00:20:10.336 --> 00:20:12.657]  In closing, before Owen Schroer and David Knight take over...
[00:20:13.544 --> 00:20:13.984]  We're good to go!
[00:20:30.709 --> 00:20:32.311]  My Patreon's already got the lowest prices.

[00:20:57.133 --> 00:20:59.494]  They're going to have to go up in food prices here very, very soon.
[00:20:59.715 --> 00:21:00.915]  They've already bought out six months.
[00:21:00.955 --> 00:21:01.856]  That's almost run out.
[00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:03.217]  They've got the food on hand.
[00:21:03.577 --> 00:21:04.498]  It ships within a week.

[00:21:17.966 --> 00:21:19.127]  At infowarsstore.com,
[00:21:19.887 --> 00:21:23.049]  We have the InfoWars Total Blowout Sale, because things are so crazy.
[00:21:23.229 --> 00:21:24.390]  We've never had a sale this big.
[00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:39.481]  Up to 60% off across the board, free shipping, 8-pack PowerStack, X2, DNA Force Plus, Vazzo Beats, Ultimate Turmeric Formula Bodies, the Winter Sun with a high-quality vitamin D3, because you need that anyways for anybody's immune system.
[00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:43.564]  Of course you need to boost your immune system, even the King of Earth, Fauci, has now said it.
[00:21:43.884 --> 00:21:44.845]  Whatever you do, realize
[00:21:45.325 --> 00:21:47.427]  Now is the time to spread the word.
[00:21:47.507 --> 00:21:48.608]  Now is the time to be informed.
[00:21:48.928 --> 00:22:03.400]  Now is the time to fund the info war at this critical time because we need capital to fund ourselves into next year and things are so bad and supply chains are breaking down that the storable foods and the supplements and the t-shirts and the things we have in stock may be the last run.
[00:22:03.661 --> 00:22:09.606]  That's why a lot of great sellers we've had aren't coming back because the companies have shut down or the supply chains have broke down.
[00:22:09.966 --> 00:22:14.889]  And it's coming out in the news that food prices are going up, and scarcity, and the third world already 2 million starved to death.
[00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.632]  And they were saying 135 million might die, now the UN says 200 plus million.
[00:22:18.992 --> 00:22:20.713]  I mean folks, this is dire.
[00:22:20.953 --> 00:22:21.994]  This is the new world order.
[00:22:22.014 --> 00:22:23.135]  This is the global shutdown.
[00:22:23.415 --> 00:22:24.496]  This is the great reset.
[00:22:24.756 --> 00:22:27.898]  And we're the tip of the spear, and the enemy wants us shut down.
[00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:30.420]  So tell folks about those local Aminathem stations.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.401]  Tell folks about the local TV stations.
[00:22:32.701 --> 00:22:34.482]  And spread the word about those affiliates.
[00:22:34.863 --> 00:22:38.325]  And spread the word about InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:22:38.665 --> 00:22:39.286]  And get the links.
[00:22:40.426 --> 00:22:43.148]  To the articles and the videos and all of it, and about everybody you know.
[00:22:43.348 --> 00:22:46.990]  We're doing a special 24-hour broadcast also that kicks off next Wednesday.
[00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:48.491]  I'll tell you more about that.
[00:22:49.792 --> 00:22:52.133]  But we are just in such a historic position.
[00:22:52.273 --> 00:22:53.754]  America is fighting for its life.
[00:22:54.094 --> 00:22:58.737]  And if we just identify who's attacking America and who the players are, we can turn this around and stop it.
[00:22:59.737 --> 00:23:08.763]  But if people don't realize this is happening and are too scared to admit the truth, then you really better be scared because the evil will be able to take over.
[00:23:09.705 --> 00:23:15.431]  Admitting all of this is happening is what enables us to say no to it and to stop it.
[00:23:15.471 --> 00:23:18.053]  And so we're coming down to the end here.
[00:23:18.293 --> 00:23:28.183]  If Trump doesn't win, if things go crazy in the civil war, the internet kill switch goes in, they're going to implement on the day of the election to selectively shut down conservatives and patriots worldwide, not just here in the U.S.
[00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:30.815]  I may never get to talk to you guys again.
[00:23:31.496 --> 00:23:40.525]  I mean, we're down to the point where it may just be over email at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter to go sign up for the free email where I'm sending you underground videos and articles that way.
[00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:42.988]  I mean, this is really a possibility now.
[00:23:44.127 --> 00:23:45.088]  We're in the New World Order.
[00:23:45.108 --> 00:23:45.828]  We're in the U.N.
[00:23:45.868 --> 00:23:46.308]  takeover.
[00:23:46.348 --> 00:23:47.349]  We're in the world government.
[00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:48.410]  We're in the lockdowns.
[00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.791]  We're in the forced inoculations.
[00:23:50.051 --> 00:23:50.711]  It's all here.
[00:23:51.252 --> 00:23:52.692]  Everything we told you about is real.
[00:23:53.513 --> 00:23:54.574]  So we've got to stay on air now.
[00:23:55.274 --> 00:23:56.535]  Again, thank you for watching.
[00:23:56.595 --> 00:23:59.417]  Coming up live in studio, Owen Schroer, David Knight, and so much more.
[00:23:59.437 --> 00:24:00.858]  I'll be back live in studio later.
[00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:03.219]  I'm dealing with a family emergency, but I'll be right back.
[00:24:03.379 --> 00:24:03.739]  God bless.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.983]  Owen Schroer and David Knight in studio here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:09.223 --> 00:24:12.385]  And ladies and gentlemen, obviously everybody is talking about President Trump.
[00:24:13.894 --> 00:24:17.436]  And the First Lady testing positive for COVID-19.
[00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:20.958]  Of course, the questions are amassing.
[00:24:21.098 --> 00:24:23.479]  Is it a false positive?
[00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:26.701]  Was the President set up during the debates?
[00:24:27.301 --> 00:24:30.282]  What is a two-week quarantine going to mean for the President?
[00:24:30.763 --> 00:24:34.725]  Conveniently, even if he did two weeks, he would still be available the night of the debates.
[00:24:35.305 --> 00:24:35.685]  I don't think so.
[00:24:57.639 --> 00:25:08.982]  We had college football teams, we had CDC releasing numbers, and then they had to change the percentages of how fatal it was, all the false positives, I mean, just all of the nonsense.
[00:25:09.422 --> 00:25:17.343]  But it's just, oh, the president tested positive, even though he's been campaigning, shown no signs, shown no symptoms, as far as we can tell, and he's on the public view every day.
[00:25:17.844 --> 00:25:18.924]  Oh, he has to be shut down.
[00:25:18.944 --> 00:25:20.824]  Oh my gosh, COVID is really deadly.
[00:25:20.864 --> 00:25:22.045]  They're telling you this on CNN.
[00:25:22.085 --> 00:25:23.485]  See, we told you, Trump supporters.
[00:25:24.568 --> 00:25:26.350]  But no questions of, is it fake?
[00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.593]  And no talks about, well, it's not even that fatal.
[00:25:30.074 --> 00:25:37.782]  Well, you know, as you pointed out, football teams, and so we're going to have to, we don't know what we're going to do because we had several people test positive on a football team, so we're going to shut this down.
[00:25:38.242 --> 00:25:44.870]  You've had schools, one school doing 10,000 tests, and we had a lot of students that have tested positive.
[00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:45.991]  Nobody's gone to the hospital.
[00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:48.132]  So, you know, what do we do about this?
[00:25:48.432 --> 00:25:49.853]  They've changed the goalposts.
[00:25:49.893 --> 00:25:51.874]  First, it's going to be we've got to flatten the curve, right?
[00:25:52.214 --> 00:25:57.837]  That was about a death toll, and it was about presumed deaths because they didn't have the test.
[00:25:58.217 --> 00:26:02.359]  There was a big aha moment, I call it, because it was American Hospital Association.
[00:26:02.759 --> 00:26:04.680]  They came back about a month ago.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:12.484]  They said, wait a minute, we're getting these notifications from Medicare saying they're not going to pay us the COVID bonus because we haven't
[00:26:12.944 --> 00:26:13.544]  We're good to go.
[00:26:36.832 --> 00:26:37.032]  Talks
[00:26:55.086 --> 00:27:07.780]  And unlike the PCR kits where they do that long swab that goes up into your nose and then they send that off to a lab and you get the result back in, you know, I guess days, this happens in 15 minutes.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.501]  It's a credit card size, five bucks.
[00:27:10.422 --> 00:27:12.544]  And they want to get a lot of these things put around.
[00:27:12.584 --> 00:27:13.985]  They said, well, this is a game changer.
[00:27:14.005 --> 00:27:21.310]  Well, the whole gist of this article from the Washington Post on Monday was to talk about how there were all these complaints about false positives.
[00:27:21.591 --> 00:27:28.175]  Now, if the Trump administration has just jumped into this with both feet, and we've got the testing czar, an admiral, and by the way,
[00:27:29.016 --> 00:27:34.580]  These people who are running the vaccine program, who are running this COVID response, it's mostly military people.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.121]  If that doesn't raise a red flag with you, nothing will.
[00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:43.306]  But anyway, this testing czar is now saying, you know, we know with every test there's going to be false positives.
[00:27:43.366 --> 00:27:44.727]  Don't worry about the false positives.
[00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:46.388]  And the whole thing is about false positives.
[00:27:46.528 --> 00:27:49.590]  Health administration officials knew the tests could be less reliable.
[00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.732]  They've encountered more false positives than expected.
[00:27:52.992 --> 00:27:57.515]  And so there's a lot of information that makes us believe this is a false positive.
[00:27:57.535 --> 00:27:58.656]  The New York Times story
[00:27:59.216 --> 00:28:07.240]  That said, 90% of those who tested positive out of three states, they were false positives.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.782]  But their response to the New York Times was, well, therefore we need to test more people.
[00:28:12.382 --> 00:28:12.662]  You know?
[00:28:13.603 --> 00:28:15.404]  This is the definition of insanity.
[00:28:15.684 --> 00:28:19.125]  You got a test that's only 10% right, so they say, well, let's do more of these.
[00:28:19.245 --> 00:28:20.466]  But they need those numbers.
[00:28:20.526 --> 00:28:21.747]  That's what it's all about.
[00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:22.927]  It's about the numbers.
[00:28:23.087 --> 00:28:26.469]  And it's more important than shutting down a university or shutting down a football team.
[00:28:27.069 --> 00:28:28.630]  Uh, or of NFL season.
[00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.853]  When they get at the beginning of this, they said, well, we got somebody who tested positive at a meatpacking plant.
[00:28:34.053 --> 00:28:35.754]  Let's shut down the entire meatpacking plant.
[00:28:35.774 --> 00:28:52.563]  That's how we got the shortages of beef, of pork, of other things like that, because we have such a centralized now that there's so few places where they actually do meatpacking that if you shut something down like that, because you got a false positive or because you just got a case and they're getting
[00:28:53.143 --> 00:28:58.705]  Positives off of people who don't have symptoms, who aren't sick, and then they're shutting down universities.
[00:28:58.745 --> 00:29:00.825]  They shut down the University of North Carolina when we were there.
[00:29:01.346 --> 00:29:02.126]  Five people.
[00:29:02.706 --> 00:29:05.727]  They had tests out of tens of thousands, I think, on campus.
[00:29:05.767 --> 00:29:08.128]  But they shut down the entire university system.
[00:29:08.548 --> 00:29:12.049]  And if they shut down your food supply based on this, we got real big problems.
[00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:14.850]  But I don't know that Trump
[00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:29.881]  It's positive when we look at all of this, but I do know that these rapid tests are very dangerous nose under the tent from the camel because along with this rapid response test, the key selling point with them,
[00:29:30.581 --> 00:29:30.921]  I think so.
[00:29:51.434 --> 00:29:58.240]  For rapid tests, so they don't have to quarantine people, begging to add this to the queue at the TSA lines.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:07.667]  And this is all going to be used to condition people for the vaccine immunity passport, which is really what this endgame is coming to.
[00:30:07.887 --> 00:30:11.150]  And also, after you have queued up, I mean, that's only 15 minutes, right?
[00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.192]  15 minutes is a long time to sit.
[00:30:13.792 --> 00:30:14.533]  And wait for something.
[00:30:14.893 --> 00:30:19.896]  Assuming that there's not a DMV type of line to get tested in addition to that.
[00:30:19.936 --> 00:30:23.118]  You could sit there for maybe a couple of hours for this rapid test.
[00:30:23.698 --> 00:30:29.402]  And after you've done this a few times, they're going to condition people and say, wait a minute, if you take the vaccine, this all goes away.
[00:30:30.182 --> 00:30:35.426]  And you just, you know, shine the little digital thing that Gates developed last year with MIT.
[00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:39.108]  So we can see you've been vaccinated, you've got your little invisible tattoo.
[00:30:39.448 --> 00:30:41.850]  We can do the same thing with that that we do with the immunity passport.
[00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:47.676]  Well, and of course, and by the way, this story came out today, you mentioned the nasal test.
[00:30:48.337 --> 00:30:55.240]  A woman leaked cerebrospinal fluid from her nose after a nasal swab COVID-19 test.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.621]  Whoa, I joked about that today.
[00:30:57.641 --> 00:31:01.302]  I said, yeah, you don't have to hit it up there and punch through your brain.
[00:31:01.383 --> 00:31:03.243]  Well, you see how they do it.
[00:31:03.263 --> 00:31:04.084]  Yeah, I know, it goes on.
[00:31:05.164 --> 00:31:06.345]  So, David, here's what they've done.
[00:31:06.725 --> 00:31:15.788]  I think this is the most general consensus, and it's not, you know, accurate, and it's, you know, if you want to bear down, but I mean, they've rebranded the flu, is what they've done.
[00:31:15.948 --> 00:31:29.653]  They've rebranded the flu, and they've used this to strike fear into people, they've used this to get people to want a vaccine, they've used this to completely control the economy, all commerce, all flows of traffic, at least that's what they want.
[00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:32.255]  And they keep moving the goalposts, like you said.
[00:31:32.315 --> 00:31:35.598]  So in the beginning it was, oh, this is so deadly, 15 days to slow the spread.
[00:31:35.618 --> 00:31:43.005]  Okay, well now we tested everybody and their mom, and we know that it's a 99% survival rate, and who really knows about a spread?
[00:31:43.045 --> 00:31:49.491]  Maybe there's a spread we've never done a... I mean, it's like a World Health Organization test of, let's see how a virus really spreads.
[00:31:49.831 --> 00:31:52.193]  Now, they're not being honest about that, but that's really what this is.
[00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:54.836]  We could do this for flu, you could do this for herpes, you could do this for anything.
[00:31:54.856 --> 00:31:56.057]  You'd get probably worse numbers.
[00:31:56.237 --> 00:31:56.477]  That's right.
[00:31:56.517 --> 00:32:05.481]  But they've already made it a fear factor with COVID, so everybody thinks, oh, it's legitimate that we change the face of the earth and civilization over this COVID.
[00:32:06.101 --> 00:32:09.402]  And just like the masks, it's social conditioning.
[00:32:09.522 --> 00:32:13.004]  It allows them to have a justification to do what they want to do anyway.
[00:32:13.224 --> 00:32:15.685]  With the masks, your masks don't protect you, they protect other people.
[00:32:15.905 --> 00:32:22.748]  That's what they were telling us about the MMR vaccine a year ago when they start mandating it in the schools and when Trump said, you just got to get the vaccine.
[00:32:22.768 --> 00:32:23.548]  That's all there is to it.
[00:32:24.228 --> 00:32:25.830]  And we've seen this game before.
[00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.671]  You're talking about how they've escalated the flu.
[00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:31.976]  We've seen the same game before every year, as a matter of fact, for several years now.
[00:32:32.516 --> 00:32:37.621]  We've seen this from the CDC, talking about how many flu cases there are and so forth.
[00:32:37.681 --> 00:32:39.322]  And we've had, I've had on my show,
[00:32:40.284 --> 00:32:48.817]  Del Bigtree and others who have shown the documents where the CDC sent information out to doctors and said, look, don't send us a test.
[00:32:48.857 --> 00:32:50.239]  We don't have enough tests.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.501]  We're overwhelmed.
[00:32:51.521 --> 00:32:52.042]  We can't do it.
[00:32:52.322 --> 00:32:54.466]  If it looks like the flu, it is the flu.
[00:32:54.506 --> 00:32:55.047]  Just count it.
[00:32:55.507 --> 00:32:56.628]  And that's where they get their numbers.
[00:32:56.668 --> 00:32:58.529]  That's why I didn't believe this stuff from the very beginning.
[00:32:58.749 --> 00:33:00.070]  And it's getting even more absurd.
[00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.752]  But they're using the massive rollout of tests.
[00:33:03.072 --> 00:33:05.374]  We're talking about 150 million tests to start with.
[00:33:05.414 --> 00:33:11.478]  Now, the Democrats, as part of their stimulus bill, are talking about $75 billion, with a B.
[00:33:11.738 --> 00:33:14.280]  $75 billion for testing and contact tracing.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.862]  I'm assuming that's not going to be the PCR test, that's going to be the rapid test.
[00:33:18.143 --> 00:33:21.345]  That means at $5 a pop, that they could get 15 billion tests.
[00:33:23.226 --> 00:33:26.188]  That's 45 tests for every man, woman, and child.
[00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:30.650]  That means they're going to run this thing out for a long time, and they're going to do a lot of control.
[00:33:32.251 --> 00:33:33.752]  That's President Trump with COVID.
[00:33:33.972 --> 00:33:34.452]  Feels good.
[00:33:35.392 --> 00:33:36.913]  Melania says she feels good, too.
[00:33:36.953 --> 00:33:37.654]  He's dancing.
[00:33:38.654 --> 00:33:39.114]  Yeah!
[00:33:39.394 --> 00:33:40.095]  Get that COVID.
[00:33:40.115 --> 00:33:40.635]  Feel good!
[00:33:40.655 --> 00:33:42.556]  Alright, we're not making light.
[00:33:42.596 --> 00:33:45.117]  People are very sick, but this whole thing is just pathetic.
[00:33:45.157 --> 00:33:47.799]  And David and I were talking in the breakout.
[00:33:47.879 --> 00:33:49.320]  The President's been playing ball with this.
[00:33:50.407 --> 00:33:54.170]  But he has the chance to change the rules now, that he has the bully pulpit.
[00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:59.994]  And, you know what, I got all this news with how the vaccines are causing worse side effects than COVID.
[00:34:00.254 --> 00:34:02.795]  Eventually, I mean, really the vaccine is going to be more deadly than COVID.
[00:34:03.056 --> 00:34:03.856]  They won't tell you that.
[00:34:05.617 --> 00:34:09.140]  Twitter and all the rest censoring the truth about COVID, that's continuing to go on.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.563]  Massive facial acne is breaking out across the nation right now.
[00:34:13.603 --> 00:34:14.564]  I wonder why, because of masks?
[00:34:14.924 --> 00:34:17.646]  And you know, funnily enough... Buy stock and clear a cell, yeah.
[00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:19.367]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:34:19.427 --> 00:34:19.907]  There you go.
[00:34:19.947 --> 00:34:22.729]  There's your stock advice for the day right there.
[00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:24.971]  Your advice for the day right there on the stock market.
[00:34:26.892 --> 00:34:34.478]  But here's what I'm trying to figure out, David, because I was thinking about this today and then you brought up some of the other oddities about this test, the antigen test.
[00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:36.039]  But I'm seeing this too.
[00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:43.465]  I'm seeing this theme as, well, the test, you know, you could have trace amounts of COVID or small amounts of COVID and, you know, it's still a positive test.
[00:34:44.065 --> 00:34:45.966]  Well, in comparison to what?
[00:34:46.346 --> 00:34:47.666]  Because this is a virus.
[00:34:47.746 --> 00:34:48.907]  A virus is not alive.
[00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:49.647]  So what?
[00:34:49.667 --> 00:34:52.748]  So I'm just, I'm confused because I've never heard anybody explain this to me.
[00:34:52.768 --> 00:34:53.328]  I'm not a doctor.
[00:34:53.808 --> 00:35:03.592]  So, I mean, I'm led to believe that there's this virus that's not alive that can somehow, I guess, procreate or expand and now it's floating in the air and it can fly.
[00:35:03.792 --> 00:35:05.192]  And now I may have a million COVIDs.
[00:35:05.212 --> 00:35:06.152]  I may have one COVID.
[00:35:06.353 --> 00:35:07.593]  It still tests positive for COVID.
[00:35:07.613 --> 00:35:08.873]  If I have a million COVIDs, I'm really sick.
[00:35:08.893 --> 00:35:10.154]  If I have one COVID, I'm not sick at all.
[00:35:10.894 --> 00:35:11.895]  None of it makes any sense.
[00:35:11.955 --> 00:35:13.356]  Nobody's explained any of this to us.
[00:35:13.736 --> 00:35:15.637]  We just look at the TV, we see the numbers go up.
[00:35:15.957 --> 00:35:16.597]  Oh my gosh!
[00:35:17.158 --> 00:35:20.019]  They say, oh it's deadly, oh it's not deadly, oh look at all the cases.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.481]  Well, you could have a little in you, but how could you even have a lot in you?
[00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:25.402]  So none of it makes any sense at all, David.
[00:35:25.422 --> 00:35:27.764]  Nobody's even using basic logic to question this.
[00:35:27.964 --> 00:35:30.145]  Well, you know, John Rapoport questioned this at the very beginning.
[00:35:30.285 --> 00:35:34.107]  And he said, look, they've tried to use the PCR test many times for a lot of other things, and it doesn't work.
[00:35:34.148 --> 00:35:37.609]  The guy who invented it, who got a Nobel Prize for it, said you can't use it for this.
[00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.910]  Why?
[00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.952]  Because it doesn't do a quantitative analysis.
[00:35:41.092 --> 00:35:48.919]  It can flag somebody without them having a sufficient viral load to be sick or most importantly to pass it on.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.242]  And so that's why the guy who invented it said you can't use it for this.
[00:35:53.282 --> 00:35:55.704]  Now a lot of people are saying that now and I'm surprised that
[00:35:56.425 --> 00:35:58.726]  It's not being reported more widely.
[00:35:59.226 --> 00:36:03.307]  John was the only one saying that six months ago, but now a lot of people are aware of that and talking about it.
[00:36:03.347 --> 00:36:08.708]  But this test, the antigen test, the Abbott Lab rapid test, is even worse.
[00:36:09.268 --> 00:36:14.750]  Because it doesn't even look for a DNA fragment at any level.
[00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:20.131]  Instead, what it looks for, the antigens it's looking for, are proteins that are associated with the virus.
[00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:23.292]  It's not even looking for the virus, it's looking for proteins associated with it.
[00:36:23.692 --> 00:36:33.147]  Now, the problem that we have, besides the quantitative, the lack of any quantitative information, which would tell you that, you know, President Trump is not sick, but he's tested positive, right?
[00:36:33.808 --> 00:36:35.010]  He doesn't have a viral load.
[00:36:35.885 --> 00:36:38.927]  But beyond that, it's the qualitative issue as well.
[00:36:39.448 --> 00:36:43.891]  Because it's not able to distinguish one coronavirus from another.
[00:36:44.131 --> 00:36:46.933]  And there's a gazillion coronaviruses out there.
[00:36:46.953 --> 00:36:53.397]  All the cold and flu variants that we have out there because your body is constantly replicating this RNA and you're getting copying errors.
[00:36:53.518 --> 00:36:57.941]  So you're getting a lot of different strains of this and it can't distinguish one from the other.
[00:36:58.381 --> 00:37:03.244]  So it's qualitatively BS, it's quantitatively BS, but it's fast.
[00:37:04.365 --> 00:37:08.209]  And we're going to use it as a passport to everything.
[00:37:08.249 --> 00:37:09.630]  And that's what's really troubling about this.
[00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.953]  A good example is this Monday story again from the Washington Post.
[00:37:12.993 --> 00:37:18.577]  And they're going into this in detail because this is an opportunity for them to attack President Trump because he jumped in on this.
[00:37:18.637 --> 00:37:22.541]  And he deserves to be attacked for jumping into this because it's bad.
[00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:24.923]  It's bullsh... It's BS, okay?
[00:37:25.763 --> 00:37:29.904]  And they talk about a particular example in Manchester, Vermont.
[00:37:30.904 --> 00:37:37.326]  They did a test, some patients in one study, they had 65 patients that tested positive.
[00:37:37.926 --> 00:37:42.267]  There were actually on second and longer tests, they found that only four of them had it.
[00:37:42.487 --> 00:37:44.948]  So we're talking about 93% false positive.
[00:37:45.208 --> 00:37:48.069]  This is why everybody's talking about, wait, you got a lot of problems with false.
[00:37:48.289 --> 00:37:53.030]  If you've got something where 93% of the people get a false positive,
[00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.512]  It's back up to the PCR level, or worse.
[00:37:57.333 --> 00:38:01.536]  But they're going to be rolling this out for everybody, and this is part of the programming aspect.
[00:38:01.556 --> 00:38:11.104]  In terms of talking about how this could be a good thing, if President Trump shows that he is in charge and he's going to have to do that, are they going to use the 25th Amendment or something to replace him?
[00:38:11.624 --> 00:38:16.468]  But if he does that, if he gets well, like Louie Gohmert did, and we've been down this whole road before.
[00:38:16.748 --> 00:38:18.530]  Remember the panic with CPAC?
[00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.031]  Oh yeah, the spread.
[00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:22.433]  You guys were there at CPAC, right?
[00:38:22.814 --> 00:38:24.695]  Everybody that was at CPAC was going to die.
[00:38:25.055 --> 00:38:26.737]  You had a couple people who tested positive.
[00:38:26.897 --> 00:38:28.478]  I don't think that anybody even got sick.
[00:38:28.538 --> 00:38:31.021]  I mean, a lot of people quarantined, but I don't think anybody got sick.
[00:38:31.641 --> 00:38:34.503]  And then you had Rand Paul who got sick, but he was treated.
[00:38:34.823 --> 00:38:36.885]  You had Bolsonaro.
[00:38:36.905 --> 00:38:40.928]  The left was applauding the fact that Bolsonaro was sick, but he recovered.
[00:38:41.228 --> 00:38:43.249]  You had Boris Johnson in the UK.
[00:38:43.269 --> 00:38:43.730]  He got sick.
[00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.650]  He actually went to the hospital.
[00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.571]  He was very sick with that.
[00:38:45.871 --> 00:38:47.352]  Probably didn't have any HCQ.
[00:38:48.033 --> 00:38:49.213]  But he recovered as well.
[00:38:49.234 --> 00:38:50.134]  You got a 99.9% chance to recover.
[00:38:52.876 --> 00:39:12.691]  And so the good news about this is that everybody watches President Trump, and if he uses HCQ, if he uses hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, zinc, and like Louie Gohmert said, I used all three of those, plus we did the asthma inhaler, the over-the-counter asthma inhaler, which is a steroid.
[00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:14.673]  And he said, I feel better than I ever felt.
[00:39:14.854 --> 00:39:16.216]  Nobody paid any attention to that.
[00:39:16.296 --> 00:39:20.061]  Remember everybody celebrating when Louie Gohmert was diagnosed as positive.
[00:39:20.662 --> 00:39:23.686]  And yet, they completely ignored it when he recovered.
[00:39:24.414 --> 00:39:30.377]  Yeah, and I think that what the President needs to do is he needs to prove, hey, there's nothing to be afraid of here.
[00:39:30.517 --> 00:39:30.857]  That's right.
[00:39:31.137 --> 00:39:33.478]  I tested positive, maybe I have it, maybe I don't.
[00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:34.799]  I'll test again every day, whatever.
[00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:37.320]  But, I'm okay.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.360]  I'm not dying.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.521]  The fear has to be seen.
[00:39:39.541 --> 00:39:40.681]  Yeah, I'm not dying.
[00:39:40.761 --> 00:39:41.221]  You know what?
[00:39:41.682 --> 00:39:45.583]  If you want to get a vaccine, fine, it's just like the flu, but you don't need to get a vaccine.
[00:39:45.643 --> 00:39:51.206]  Most people are going to survive this, and he can change the rules of the whole COVID thing overnight with this.
[00:39:51.226 --> 00:39:51.726]  If he wants to.
[00:39:51.966 --> 00:39:52.787]  With this test.
[00:39:53.127 --> 00:39:54.909]  And if he wants to, we'll see what happens.
[00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:57.831]  And obviously there's going to be people trying to steer him in each direction.
[00:39:58.291 --> 00:40:03.296]  But you know, I can't help but get my mind out of the gutter on this one, David.
[00:40:03.776 --> 00:40:06.058]  Nobody's ever really explained any of this to me.
[00:40:06.618 --> 00:40:12.804]  And so I'm sitting here like a layman, seeing this whole COVID thing change the world and society as I know it, but none of it makes any sense.
[00:40:12.884 --> 00:40:15.526]  Okay, so you have a virus, which is not alive.
[00:40:15.586 --> 00:40:16.387]  It can't procreate.
[00:40:16.427 --> 00:40:18.288]  It can't remake itself.
[00:40:18.348 --> 00:40:19.930]  I mean, I've never heard of a virus like that.
[00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.752]  But yet, okay, then how does it go?
[00:40:23.193 --> 00:40:24.133]  How does it get everywhere?
[00:40:24.173 --> 00:40:25.575]  How does your viral load change?
[00:40:25.615 --> 00:40:27.156]  How is one person sicker than the other?
[00:40:27.176 --> 00:40:28.257]  It doesn't make any sense!
[00:40:28.798 --> 00:40:31.440]  We've been lied to at the very outset of this.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.883]  A virus is something that attaches itself to your cells.
[00:40:34.903 --> 00:40:37.545]  Your cells bring it in and they replicate it.
[00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:42.346]  Reproduce it, because, you know, the RNA-DNA code is just like a computer code.
[00:40:42.366 --> 00:40:45.329]  So it's got a code, so it reproduces, and they destroy themselves.
[00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:49.293]  And so it becomes very destructive, but your body actually manufactures that.
[00:40:49.353 --> 00:41:02.026]  That's why it's so concerning when you look at this mRNA approach, because what they're doing is giving you an RNA sequence to get your body to replicate something that is an antigen.
[00:41:02.606 --> 00:41:07.488]  And there is a correlation between several different types of cancer and viruses.
[00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:07.848]  Why?
[00:41:07.968 --> 00:41:20.832]  Because when you start modifying and tricking human cells into replicating something that is foreign or should not be in that place, you get a particular kidney cancer or something, your body starts replicating.
[00:41:21.172 --> 00:41:21.812]  We're good to go.
[00:41:39.019 --> 00:41:44.763]  One of the persons said I had chills so bad that I cracked a tooth chattering.
[00:41:45.103 --> 00:41:54.149]  I mean, they've got some severe side effects and all of these early vaccine candidates, all of them have been selected for Operation Warp Speed White because they were fast.
[00:41:54.209 --> 00:41:55.229]  We don't care if it's safe.
[00:41:55.489 --> 00:41:56.570]  We don't care if it's effective.
[00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:57.891]  We don't care how much it costs.
[00:41:58.211 --> 00:42:00.833]  We want it fast, because that's our ticket to get out of here.
[00:42:01.033 --> 00:42:07.918]  And that's the most dangerous thing about this, is that President Trump has accepted this as the endgame to get out of the lockdown.
[00:42:08.178 --> 00:42:10.159]  The lockdown is what has destroyed the economy.
[00:42:10.419 --> 00:42:13.241]  The lockdown is what has screwed up the elections.
[00:42:13.962 --> 00:42:15.583]  The lockdown is the lockdown, stupid.
[00:42:15.743 --> 00:42:16.663]  It really is this time.
[00:42:17.144 --> 00:42:18.985]  And that's not the way to get out of it with a vaccine.
[00:42:19.425 --> 00:42:24.368]  Yeah, and people are weakening their immune systems when they wear the mask and when they quarantine.
[00:42:24.389 --> 00:42:26.110]  But see, that's what scares me, David.
[00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:27.531]  They can take
[00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:34.113]  They can take the science of this and then sell you an RNA-modifying vaccine as a good thing.
[00:42:34.433 --> 00:42:36.774]  Like, oh, you'll never have to worry about a virus again.
[00:42:36.794 --> 00:42:40.095]  Oh, forget about the people that took the vaccine and died.
[00:42:40.135 --> 00:42:40.855]  Don't worry about them.
[00:42:41.295 --> 00:42:43.016]  You'll never see their names in court or on TV.
[00:42:43.556 --> 00:42:44.657]  No, this is going to be good.
[00:42:44.697 --> 00:42:47.039]  It's going to reprogram your cells to defeat any virus.
[00:42:47.059 --> 00:42:48.380]  You'll have super cells now.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.382]  And then, of course, that'll create some other mutation that'll kill you dead in a hammer.
[00:42:51.682 --> 00:42:52.363]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:42:52.743 --> 00:42:54.685]  Twelve billion dollars was the last number I saw.
[00:42:54.785 --> 00:42:57.687]  Twelve billion dollars on the table for who gets the first vaccine out.
[00:42:58.127 --> 00:42:58.208]  Oh!
[00:42:59.008 --> 00:43:00.310]  Yeah, we pay for it.
[00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:08.119]  We keep them immune from any damage charges to anybody because Fauci took care of that first thing when he went to the NIA.
[00:43:08.139 --> 00:43:09.961]  He's well trained at that.
[00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:13.845]  And then we have the military deliver it and perhaps even inject it to people.
[00:43:13.865 --> 00:43:16.788]  I don't know how they're going to roll this thing out, but you've already got
[00:43:17.469 --> 00:43:22.392]  A guy from Bill Gates' vaccine organization, Gavi, saying, well, you know, we're going to have to do mass vaccines.
[00:43:22.432 --> 00:43:23.352]  Everybody's going to be lined up.
[00:43:23.673 --> 00:43:25.413]  It's not going to be a doctor that's going to be doing this.
[00:43:25.473 --> 00:43:27.274]  It's just going to be, you know, going to go to a shed or whatever.
[00:43:27.895 --> 00:43:36.620]  I've got people sending me plans of buildings that they're being paid to build that are, you know, just a basic shed.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.221]  They said, do it fast.
[00:43:38.501 --> 00:43:38.221]  $50,000.
[00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:40.562]  We don't care about anything except electrical code.
[00:43:41.002 --> 00:43:46.125]  And it says for immunization and for phlebotomy, you know, blood drawing and so forth.
[00:43:46.385 --> 00:43:47.926]  So they said, we're just going to be doing this everywhere.
[00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:53.630]  So we're going to have to have some way that we can identify who got the first shot and who got the follow-up second shot.
[00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.833]  So we need to have a central database, which means we've got to have the ID.
[00:43:58.033 --> 00:43:58.253]  ID 2020.
[00:43:58.333 --> 00:43:59.594]  We need tyranny.
[00:43:59.694 --> 00:44:00.035]  That's all.
[00:44:00.635 --> 00:44:01.536]  Tyranny is what we need.
[00:44:01.576 --> 00:44:02.756]  That's what they tell you every time.
[00:44:03.477 --> 00:44:04.378]  You need to be a slave.
[00:44:04.398 --> 00:44:05.278]  It's the only way to free you.
[00:44:06.879 --> 00:44:10.222]  Yeah, the virus of the deep state is much worse than COVID.
[00:44:10.422 --> 00:44:11.623]  It's Chris Wray.
[00:44:11.723 --> 00:44:12.883]  It's Gina Haspel.
[00:44:14.144 --> 00:44:14.665]  It's Fauci.
[00:44:16.513 --> 00:44:17.954]  These are the real viruses right here.
[00:44:18.015 --> 00:44:19.816]  Now, final segment with David Knight.
[00:44:19.856 --> 00:44:21.598]  I was going to make this comparison and it's perfect.
[00:44:21.638 --> 00:44:23.220]  This comes right across my desk right now.
[00:44:24.481 --> 00:44:30.587]  You've got thousands of Central American migrants attempting to come into the U.S.
[00:44:30.627 --> 00:44:31.068]  illegally.
[00:44:31.108 --> 00:44:32.129]  It's another migrant caravan.
[00:44:34.181 --> 00:44:43.148]  And I see these Biden handlers coming out and saying, Biden is being very safe, very conservative, we all need to be very safe with this virus, very conservative, protect yourself.
[00:44:43.608 --> 00:44:44.729]  But then the border's wide open!
[00:44:45.009 --> 00:44:49.433]  And they carry in disease, and they carry in viruses, and guns, and rapists, and murderers.
[00:44:49.713 --> 00:44:58.479]  But oh, David, we need to take every precaution and every measure to make sure, and your mask, and gloves, and you know, just don't even leave the house, and you know, get tested every day.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.963]  But hey, down at the border, oh, it's a free-for-all down there, don't worry about anything, David.
[00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:08.253]  Yeah, and of course, that was the card that played with Trump at the beginning when he said, all right, we're going to limit travel coming in.
[00:45:08.313 --> 00:45:09.374]  They called him xenophobic.
[00:45:09.414 --> 00:45:10.795]  They complained about that as well.
[00:45:11.355 --> 00:45:12.976]  Here's the bottom line, Owen.
[00:45:13.757 --> 00:45:15.998]  They will complain about whatever he did.
[00:45:16.058 --> 00:45:17.159]  He can't please them.
[00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:18.600]  So he needs to do the right thing.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.102]  And he put all of his trust in terms of ending the lockdown.
[00:45:22.143 --> 00:45:23.283]  The lockdown is the key.
[00:45:23.583 --> 00:45:26.465]  The lockdown is destroying the economy.
[00:45:26.545 --> 00:45:33.370]  The lockdown is the basis for which they are rigging this election with all the ballot harvesting and all this other stuff.
[00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:35.631]  And so the lockdown itself has to end.
[00:45:35.831 --> 00:45:45.893]  But for other reasons, other than just the election, and for other reasons than Trump is going to make everything right, we've got to start building things from the ground up.
[00:45:45.933 --> 00:45:53.315]  And I was really happy to see that Shelly Luther, the hair salon owner, she got into a race with a candidate that was supported by Abbott.
[00:45:53.755 --> 00:45:54.215]  I don't think so.
[00:46:13.649 --> 00:46:15.130]  They're cutting us off.
[00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:20.051]  100,000 businesses shut down with this lockdown, and all the people that they employed.
[00:46:20.732 --> 00:46:24.973]  And so President Trump has to enforce our individual liberties.
[00:46:25.013 --> 00:46:26.214]  He has to stand up for that.
[00:46:26.394 --> 00:46:28.575]  He has to stand up for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:46:29.055 --> 00:46:40.359]  He has to stop this when it's being done by governors, and a lot of this is being done by Republican governors, like Abbott, like Little, like Ivey in Alabama, just extending the mask mandates and so forth.
[00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:42.440]  This is happening all over the country.
[00:46:43.188 --> 00:46:48.730]  Get out of this partisan, blinder situation and understand who's doing what.
[00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.110]  And then respond accordingly.
[00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.571]  Don't support these people if they're going to keep doing this.
[00:46:53.951 --> 00:47:00.673]  But President Trump put all of his hope in the vaccine thing, and now all these vaccine guys are going to give him a fast vaccine, and he gave him $12 billion.
[00:47:01.373 --> 00:47:02.654]  Now they're all saying, no, you can't have it.
[00:47:03.174 --> 00:47:04.255]  We're going to keep this thing going.
[00:47:04.375 --> 00:47:05.596]  And they know they're going to keep it going.
[00:47:05.796 --> 00:47:12.281]  They've already been saying for several months that they're going to extend this at least into next summer, probably 2022.
[00:47:14.403 --> 00:47:14.843]  But never.
[00:47:15.044 --> 00:47:15.944]  It'll never stop.
[00:47:15.964 --> 00:47:17.866]  They'll always need a new one, just like the flu shot.
[00:47:17.886 --> 00:47:19.527]  They'll always say it's just a few months away.
[00:47:23.334 --> 00:47:24.155]  story this morning.
[00:47:24.235 --> 00:47:25.855]  He got his vaccine, David.
[00:47:25.875 --> 00:47:26.896]  You gotta get your vaccine.
[00:47:26.916 --> 00:47:27.797]  I mean, it's good.
[00:47:27.857 --> 00:47:29.277]  And he has a psychopath smile.
[00:47:29.558 --> 00:47:31.339]  But see, here's what I wish.
[00:47:31.359 --> 00:47:32.679]  I mean, because we live in the clown world.
[00:47:32.719 --> 00:47:34.740]  We can debate vaccines and all.
[00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:35.921]  We can debate things all day long.
[00:47:35.961 --> 00:47:49.129]  But when there's no logic, when logic is dead, when reasoning is dead, and the average American can't look at how this COVID hoax is destroying our economy, destroying the world economy, just tearing apart our way of life, forcing people to live in fear.
[00:47:49.149 --> 00:47:49.629]  But hey, again,
[00:47:50.506 --> 00:47:56.652]  Border's wide open, people are coming pouring in by the thousands, bringing disease, murderers, rapists, hey yo, not all bad, not all bad, whatever.
[00:47:57.633 --> 00:48:07.863]  It's the paradigm of how come we don't have the same treatment of our border, which is safety, general safety, and precautions, and conservatives, but oh, but
[00:48:08.183 --> 00:48:09.824]  You know, you need to be afraid of COVID.
[00:48:10.065 --> 00:48:10.725]  It's all political.
[00:48:10.825 --> 00:48:11.766]  The masks are political.
[00:48:11.786 --> 00:48:12.447]  Everything is political.
[00:48:12.467 --> 00:48:15.149]  Look, people are now starting to understand.
[00:48:15.169 --> 00:48:17.491]  I just talked to Eric Peters this morning.
[00:48:17.511 --> 00:48:22.995]  He said, yeah, see, as I go around places, all of these signs everywhere, you got to wear the mask, got to wear the mask.
[00:48:23.055 --> 00:48:23.836]  I don't wear the mask.
[00:48:23.896 --> 00:48:26.058]  And now people are not even saying anything to me about it.
[00:48:26.158 --> 00:48:28.280]  I had the same experience when we went back to North Carolina.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.122]  Signs everywhere there and in Tennessee and you go in and people got the mask under their nose.
[00:48:33.162 --> 00:48:33.702]  They don't care.
[00:48:33.722 --> 00:48:35.483]  They don't even look at you twice about this.
[00:48:35.523 --> 00:48:37.104]  We all know it's a fraud.
[00:48:37.144 --> 00:48:38.044]  Why do we know it's a fraud?
[00:48:38.524 --> 00:48:44.347]  Because we've got some churches that have been holding church since March and they've got thousands of people and they're not sick.
[00:48:44.387 --> 00:48:54.832]  We've got the church in LA that the LA people are coming after because they've got 7,000 people packed into a church, no social distancing, no masks, singing, nobody's getting sick.
[00:48:54.912 --> 00:48:55.852]  We know it's a fraud.
[00:48:56.193 --> 00:48:56.773]  Live your life.
[00:48:59.718 --> 00:49:03.119]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[00:49:03.139 --> 00:49:04.260]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.841]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[00:49:06.021 --> 00:49:07.401]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[00:49:07.521 --> 00:49:08.542]  I want them shut down.
[00:49:08.602 --> 00:49:09.502]  I want them silenced.
[00:49:09.562 --> 00:49:10.243]  I want them muted.
[00:49:10.283 --> 00:49:12.183]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:49:12.203 --> 00:49:13.144]  You kept us on air.
[00:49:13.264 --> 00:49:14.544]  We did the analysis first.
[00:49:14.845 --> 00:49:15.845]  It's now gone mainstream.
[00:49:15.905 --> 00:49:17.706]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[00:49:17.986 --> 00:49:23.909]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[00:49:24.089 --> 00:49:25.549]  And you need to stop right now.
[00:49:25.649 --> 00:49:26.690]  And they're very, very serious.
[00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:29.231]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:30.392]  This is not going to happen.
[00:49:30.412 --> 00:49:32.052]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[00:49:32.513 --> 00:49:33.613]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[00:49:34.073 --> 00:49:34.974]  Rescue InfoWars.
[00:49:35.054 --> 00:49:35.694]  Save yourself.
[00:49:36.054 --> 00:49:36.695]  Save the world.
[00:49:37.015 --> 00:49:37.875]  We're in this together.
[00:49:37.995 --> 00:49:39.936]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:49:39.956 --> 00:49:40.637]  Communism's up here.
[00:49:40.817 --> 00:49:43.778]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[00:49:44.159 --> 00:49:45.980]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.740]  My children are right here!
[00:49:48.481 --> 00:49:50.202]  But I need money to fight a war!
[00:49:50.422 --> 00:49:51.462]  And I need word of mouth!
[00:49:51.682 --> 00:49:52.583]  And I need prayer!
[00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:53.683]  And I need action!
[00:49:54.084 --> 00:49:55.644]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[00:49:56.365 --> 00:49:58.326]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[00:49:59.815 --> 00:50:14.308]  Trump set to declare a national emergency, and then the sub-headline at Infowars.com is the fact that the deep state wants to assassinate Trump and blame it on coronavirus.
[00:50:14.448 --> 00:50:22.916]  Oh, make no mistake, the ether has been swimming with that for about a week here at the office, and I wasn't ready to go to it until
[00:50:24.634 --> 00:50:25.094]  Wednesday.
[00:50:26.955 --> 00:50:32.537]  And then I came up here last night to shoot a video on it and I didn't get it done because I was dealing with other stuff.
[00:50:33.217 --> 00:50:34.237]  There's a lot going on.
[00:50:35.318 --> 00:50:40.439]  But I will talk about that at the start of the next segment.
[00:50:40.639 --> 00:50:45.561]  But can we pull up on InfoWars.com the main feed of the show?
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:51:00.375]  If you just go to InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com and you'll see the live feed of the show right there and it says Trump said to declare a national emergency, leftist.
[00:51:01.653 --> 00:51:05.276]  Targeting 45 for an assassination to be blamed on coronavirus.
[00:51:05.316 --> 00:51:06.697]  Well, that's quite a claim.
[00:51:08.279 --> 00:51:16.886]  It's like the claim we said six weeks ago that they're going to, that the virus comes back, like HIV, over and over again and you can't get rid of it.
[00:51:17.046 --> 00:51:20.109]  Oh, that's now Reuters AP.
[00:51:22.651 --> 00:51:23.191]  Everything today.
[00:51:26.594 --> 00:51:26.975]  Truth is,
[00:51:28.698 --> 00:51:31.059]  The globalist problem is they're science.
[00:51:31.479 --> 00:51:35.521]  So they can use science for evil, but there are other institutions and universities and people that aren't evil.
[00:51:36.021 --> 00:51:37.722]  They go and they look and they tell us this.
[00:51:38.823 --> 00:51:40.543]  And they're like, shut up, it's not true.
[00:51:40.683 --> 00:51:42.964]  Shut up, University of Wisconsin.
[00:51:43.044 --> 00:51:44.565]  Shut up, University of New Delhi.
[00:51:45.005 --> 00:51:47.947]  Shut up, you know, University in Switzerland.
[00:51:47.967 --> 00:51:53.369]  We're like, hey, this thing has HIV delivery system.
[00:51:56.932 --> 00:51:57.675]  Oh, shut up.
[00:51:57.755 --> 00:52:01.126]  And like, oh yeah, HIV, drugs, treat it.
[00:52:01.146 --> 00:52:01.869]  People are like, what?
[00:52:01.969 --> 00:52:03.173]  Alex said that six weeks ago.
[00:52:04.991 --> 00:52:06.792]  And again, it's not that we're that smart.
[00:52:07.473 --> 00:52:08.914]  We understand how stuff works.
[00:52:09.294 --> 00:52:10.135]  Everyone's not evil.
[00:52:10.915 --> 00:52:12.296]  Everyone's not involved in a conspiracy.
[00:52:12.837 --> 00:52:23.304]  That's the globalist problem, is there's all these professional classes and all these smart people that are out there that actually have studied things and they know what they're seeing, and they're going, hey, this is manufactured.
[00:52:23.324 --> 00:52:24.165]  They're like, shut up!
[00:52:24.605 --> 00:52:24.985]  Shut up!
[00:52:25.025 --> 00:52:25.686]  Your funding's cut!
[00:52:25.706 --> 00:52:32.711]  They're like, whoa, well, the university says I'm fired if I don't withdraw my paper and say it's wrong, but I'm not going to withdraw my paper and say it's wrong.
[00:52:34.554 --> 00:52:35.555]  I'll just withdraw my paper.
[00:52:36.776 --> 00:52:43.801]  And then three more universities come out and say, yeah, not only is this artificial, it's been weaponized.
[00:52:46.002 --> 00:52:58.852]  And that's really the big story, is that it's mutating, and it's the perfect cover for an off-the-shelf bioweapon that you can go and tweak parts of it
[00:53:00.089 --> 00:53:06.595]  And then release it on a certain group as race-specific, or even on an individual, and then it mutates and becomes harmless right after it.
[00:53:08.117 --> 00:53:09.759]  It has a very quick half-life.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:11.861]  Think about that.
[00:53:13.402 --> 00:53:18.727]  The left is trying to parlay it that the patriot president of Brazil has it, and that Trump has it.
[00:53:19.528 --> 00:53:21.490]  The Brazilian president has tested negative.
[00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:23.051]  The media is running with the fact that he has it.
[00:53:23.902 --> 00:53:26.584]  They're not talking about quarantining Trump, removing him from power.
[00:53:27.024 --> 00:53:32.308]  They could release a designer bioweapon on the president and say the coronavirus did it.
[00:53:32.928 --> 00:53:34.550]  That's something I'll cover at the bottom of the hour.
[00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:36.371]  I said I'd get into it earlier, but I got sidetracked.
[00:53:37.312 --> 00:53:51.642]  I wonder if that's going to be a precursor into maybe postponing the election along with their posting pictures of Trump with these leaders who are positive or supposedly positive of coronavirus.
[00:53:52.995 --> 00:53:57.216]  Oh, they're 100% getting ready to say Trump has coronavirus, then kill him and say it killed him.
[00:53:57.736 --> 00:53:58.057]  That's it.
[00:53:58.157 --> 00:54:06.699]  Or, or, or the 25th Amendment, which he's disabled and can't run for the country, and then bring Hillary on a broker convention.
[00:54:07.659 --> 00:54:14.721]  Notice they said that Brazil's Bolsonaro says he's tested negative, but he's really got the virus.
[00:54:15.741 --> 00:54:16.701]  And Trump's got it!
[00:54:17.442 --> 00:54:22.063]  So they can hit him with a bioweapon or whatever and say, oh, Trump died from coronavirus.
[00:54:23.504 --> 00:54:27.765]  And most people that Trump's come in contact with have had this virus.
[00:54:28.725 --> 00:54:31.826]  But I just find it funny that none of the Democrats have it.
[00:54:32.326 --> 00:54:35.627]  And at least if they do, I've not seen it come out yet.
[00:54:36.487 --> 00:54:37.908]  But I support the president.
[00:54:38.228 --> 00:54:39.288]  I'm actually worried about him.
[00:54:39.608 --> 00:54:41.589]  I know he's doing his best.
[00:54:41.669 --> 00:54:41.969]  He's 73.
[00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:48.090]  And I just don't know what's going to happen with him or this country.
[00:54:48.331 --> 00:54:49.831]  But this is a spiritual battle.
[00:54:51.192 --> 00:54:53.853]  It's all these celebrities and famous people, right?
[00:54:54.314 --> 00:54:57.655]  So I'm a little worried about Trump, like the other callers are saying.
[00:54:57.735 --> 00:55:02.718]  I think that this is just- That's what the whole office, like, a week ago, and then I was like, oh, whatever.
[00:55:03.078 --> 00:55:05.159]  Then two days ago, it was like, everybody's like, no.
[00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:08.240]  It's an excuse to kill Trump and say it's a bioweapon.
[00:55:08.601 --> 00:55:11.022]  And then it started clicking, because all they do is just like, he's got it!
[00:55:11.262 --> 00:55:11.902]  He's got it!
[00:55:12.202 --> 00:55:12.883]  Take him out!
[00:55:13.523 --> 00:55:17.365]  He didn't, he created it, he did it, and Trump's got it.
[00:55:18.553 --> 00:55:27.456]  Exactly, and I think because of his age, and they say that he eats McDonald's and all that, they're just going to use it as an excuse to say that he was, you know, not healthy enough to fight it.
[00:55:27.476 --> 00:55:28.957]  Well, I know this.
[00:55:29.057 --> 00:55:35.479]  A group collective, the Oracle of the People, is saying they're trying to poison Trump and give him the coronavirus.
[00:55:36.879 --> 00:55:38.920]  They're hyping it up massively.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.141]  So, that's what they're actually saying now.
[00:55:43.142 --> 00:55:45.983]  Yesterday, I'm like, well, they blame him for corona and say he's got it.
[00:55:46.043 --> 00:55:47.003]  Now they're actually saying it.
[00:55:48.609 --> 00:56:00.065]  There's the Alex Jones Show back in March of this year, ladies and gentlemen, and... It's all... It's all getting a little too real, but you know, I... I've got a bunch of news and I'm gonna come back and cover it.
[00:56:02.967 --> 00:56:04.988]  Here's my setback for today.
[00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:07.069]  Here's my mental block for today.
[00:56:07.089 --> 00:56:08.990]  Because, I mean, it's like one of the biggest news days ever.
[00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:13.152]  I mean, we're sitting here in limbo now over the president has COVID.
[00:56:13.192 --> 00:56:21.756]  But see, you know, I know, the crew knows, David Knight knows, Alex Jones knows, anybody with a brain knows, this is just a distraction.
[00:56:23.017 --> 00:56:26.758]  This is just a shiny object distracting us from whatever is really going on.
[00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:29.600]  Trump tests positive for COVID?
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.300]  Who cares?
[00:56:31.741 --> 00:56:32.161]  He's fine.
[00:56:33.427 --> 00:56:37.190]  COVID is 99.9% survival.
[00:56:39.212 --> 00:56:41.615]  So, it's a big nothing burger.
[00:56:42.135 --> 00:56:56.969]  But it's not a nothing burger in that, uh-oh, you see the left cheering for Trump's death, you see Nancy Pelosi going on national news talking about how she could become the president because of the way the Constitution is written, all of a sudden she cares about the Constitution.
[00:56:57.964 --> 00:57:01.207]  You see the vaccines getting pushed and then pushed back.
[00:57:01.868 --> 00:57:03.650]  We see the shutdown continuing.
[00:57:04.271 --> 00:57:06.413]  We see the fear-mongering continuing.
[00:57:07.214 --> 00:57:08.535]  But yet, whoa!
[00:57:09.336 --> 00:57:10.698]  Now we're all kind of paused.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.782]  Okay, Trump has COVID, so now what?
[00:57:17.104 --> 00:57:18.306]  So when Trump comes out of this,
[00:57:20.011 --> 00:57:20.812]  Harm free?
[00:57:21.452 --> 00:57:21.813]  Then what?
[00:57:22.153 --> 00:57:23.534]  Do we continue the fake panic?
[00:57:23.674 --> 00:57:26.797]  Do we continue the illegal shutdown?
[00:57:26.817 --> 00:57:28.478]  Do we continue the fear mongering?
[00:57:29.059 --> 00:57:30.920]  Do we continue the push for the vaccine?
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:31.781]  President?
[00:57:32.401 --> 00:57:34.283]  Old man, just got it, didn't even have a symptom!
[00:57:36.365 --> 00:57:37.325]  What's all the fear about?
[00:57:39.087 --> 00:57:46.313]  And you know, honestly, I think that, and this is just the current time space, who knows what could happen in a week, two weeks, three weeks.
[00:57:47.494 --> 00:57:48.575]  31 days left in the election.
[00:57:50.606 --> 00:58:07.482]  This is now the greatest opportunity President Trump has ever had in his presidency to do what we all know needs to be done.
[00:58:10.164 --> 00:58:11.766]  Alright, he's quarantined, he's at the office.
[00:58:13.968 --> 00:58:15.269]  He can't leave, he can't campaign.
[00:58:17.728 --> 00:58:24.012]  He needs to dig in deep to get all the Russian collusion hoax documents released.
[00:58:24.493 --> 00:58:27.114]  And if that means getting rid of Gina Haspel, then so be it.
[00:58:28.235 --> 00:58:40.083]  He needs to make sure that the Democrat terror squads, whether it's people masquerading as Antifa or BLM or anything else in between, are shut down and treated like domestic terrorists.
[00:58:41.644 --> 00:58:45.927]  But more than anything, he needs to come out about the truth about COVID.
[00:58:48.499 --> 00:58:55.722]  And say how the economic shutdown is not worth it, there's no point wearing a mask, and it's time to end this whole charade.
[00:58:56.782 --> 00:59:01.424]  And he can do all of it in this golden opportunity with the bully pulpit and all the attention on him.
[00:59:02.764 --> 00:59:12.988]  And, you know, if he doesn't use this next two weeks to really come out and defeat these lies and this cage of lies we're living in, people are going to be really upset.
[00:59:13.608 --> 00:59:14.569]  Really missed opportunity.
[00:59:15.478 --> 00:59:18.341]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:18.361 --> 00:59:26.027]  You know, I gotta tell ya, I'm just kind of at a crossroads right now about what to do here for the rest of this hour.
[00:59:26.648 --> 00:59:28.970]  I've got a bunch of news, and I've got some videos.
[00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:36.977]  We've got a great guest coming up, by the way, Dr. Carrie Medej, who's been calling out the COVID hoax and the real agenda behind it for a while now.
[00:59:37.057 --> 00:59:37.977]  She's gonna be joining us.
[00:59:39.159 --> 00:59:41.621]  And Alex may be back in studio for that.
[00:59:42.342 --> 00:59:46.206]  We've got Satanists on Twitter celebrating Trump's COVID positive test.
[00:59:46.226 --> 00:59:48.528]  We're gonna have a story at InfoWars.com on that.
[00:59:48.548 --> 00:59:49.489]  It's just crazy stuff.
[00:59:49.509 --> 00:59:50.630]  You've never even seen it before.
[00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:53.473]  You've got... I mean, that's the thing.
[00:59:53.533 --> 00:59:54.574]  I can get in all this news.
[00:59:55.895 --> 00:59:59.618]  I want to play the clip where they leak the Melania phone calls, which just makes me like...
[01:00:00.444 --> 01:00:02.925]  Head over heels in love with Melania hearing that phone call?
[01:00:02.965 --> 01:00:03.785]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:00:04.385 --> 01:00:05.546]  They think that makes her look bad?
[01:00:05.606 --> 01:00:06.866]  It makes her look better than she's ever looked?
[01:00:07.526 --> 01:00:07.726]  Ever.
[01:00:08.446 --> 01:00:09.547]  And she's always looking good.
[01:00:11.047 --> 01:00:15.148]  But man, I mean, part of me just wants to open up the phone lines, because folks, this is all a distraction.
[01:00:15.428 --> 01:00:16.489]  This is all a big distraction.
[01:00:16.729 --> 01:00:17.769]  What is it a distraction from?
[01:00:17.889 --> 01:00:18.869]  What is actually going on?
[01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:20.070]  Do they have Trump?
[01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:22.671]  Has Trump been caught in a trap?
[01:00:24.191 --> 01:00:27.032]  Or is he setting a trap?
[01:00:29.053 --> 01:00:30.334]  Because that's really what this comes down here.
[01:00:30.634 --> 01:00:38.217]  Either Trump is caught in a trap, and this is gonna go bad, or Trump is setting a trap.
[01:00:38.257 --> 01:00:42.899]  Because if Trump is just gonna say, oh, okay, well, we've tested positive for COVID, we're gonna quarantine.
[01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:47.630]  And then he comes out of it and it's just like, yep, okay, pandemic's still going, we still need masks and everything.
[01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:49.310]  Well then what the hell's going on here?
[01:00:50.411 --> 01:00:51.672]  What is the president doing at this point?
[01:00:51.872 --> 01:00:53.392]  Why is Chris Wray still running the FBI?
[01:00:53.592 --> 01:00:55.313]  Why is Gina Haspel still running the CIA?
[01:00:55.533 --> 01:00:57.414]  They're covering up for Democrat crimes.
[01:00:57.594 --> 01:00:59.375]  They're covering up for the crimes of Obama.
[01:01:00.496 --> 01:01:02.777]  They're covering up for the Democrat terrorists on the streets.
[01:01:03.377 --> 01:01:04.878]  They're covering up for George Soros.
[01:01:06.218 --> 01:01:06.999]  That's what's going on.
[01:01:08.284 --> 01:01:13.585]  And now we, the American people, are going to sit here and let Trump go into quarantine for two weeks over a virus that doesn't even make him sick?
[01:01:13.805 --> 01:01:14.446]  Where he's fine?
[01:01:14.786 --> 01:01:17.006]  Mark Meadows was just on TV saying the President's fine.
[01:01:17.626 --> 01:01:19.427]  He's energetic, he's working, he's in high spirits.
[01:01:19.627 --> 01:01:20.487]  Yeah, we just saw him!
[01:01:20.647 --> 01:01:21.927]  He works every damn day!
[01:01:24.868 --> 01:01:29.749]  Hell, half the people that are completely healthy don't work as much as Trump with COVID!
[01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:32.510]  If it's even a real test result!
[01:01:35.023 --> 01:01:36.283]  If it's not a false positive.
[01:01:36.323 --> 01:01:38.384]  So, I mean, I'm tempted to get to the... You know what?
[01:01:38.684 --> 01:01:39.164]  I can do both.
[01:01:40.924 --> 01:01:42.085]  What do you think is going on?
[01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:47.786]  We can take calls for at least two segments before the doctor comes on and then Alex rejoins us as well.
[01:01:47.806 --> 01:01:48.206]  877-789-2539.
[01:01:49.527 --> 01:01:52.627]  I can get you on two minutes max.
[01:01:52.887 --> 01:01:54.268]  Try to get it out in 90 seconds.
[01:01:54.408 --> 01:01:55.588]  What do you think is really going on?
[01:01:56.068 --> 01:01:57.649]  Has Trump been caught in a trap?
[01:01:59.009 --> 01:02:00.369]  Is Trump caught in the COVID trap?
[01:02:00.409 --> 01:02:01.410]  Will he fight his way out of it?
[01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:02.810]  Is Trump setting a trap?
[01:02:03.932 --> 01:02:15.303]  Using this distraction to build momentum for something bigger, or is Trump just really numb or ignorant to it all and he's just going along with the whole thing and it's just, oh, this is just normal life now.
[01:02:15.423 --> 01:02:18.085]  We just all pretend like COVID is the biggest story in the world.
[01:02:19.727 --> 01:02:23.070]  So, I'm gonna do calls for two segments before the good doctor joins us.
[01:02:24.397 --> 01:02:27.639]  Two minutes max, try to get it out in 90 seconds so I can take as many as possible.
[01:02:27.659 --> 01:02:28.780]  8-7-7-7-8-9-2-5-3-9.
[01:02:29.181 --> 01:02:35.065]  Because this is just, because it's weird, like, this is such a story, you see everybody freaking out.
[01:02:35.345 --> 01:02:36.586]  It's not even impacting me at all.
[01:02:36.866 --> 01:02:38.608]  I'm wondering what's really going on.
[01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:42.731]  What is really going on?
[01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:44.572]  Has Trump been caught in a trap?
[01:02:44.913 --> 01:02:46.114]  Is Trump setting a trap?
[01:02:46.874 --> 01:02:50.537]  Or is this just Trump accepting the new normal which is COVID just dictates our lives?
[01:02:51.698 --> 01:02:52.719]  Now, in the meantime, let me do
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.062]  In fact, let's go to the Melania Trump leaked phone call.
[01:02:58.242 --> 01:02:58.822]  Oh my gosh.
[01:02:59.022 --> 01:03:06.044]  Think about all these people that spy on Trump and go into his records and Melania and all these people and they leak all this crap and they have nothing!
[01:03:06.745 --> 01:03:07.585]  They have nothing!
[01:03:08.245 --> 01:03:11.246]  Listen to a phone call they leak of Melania Trump that they think makes her look bad.
[01:03:11.446 --> 01:03:16.228]  She's never been more personable in her life than this phone call being leaked.
[01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:20.852]  They say I'm complicit.
[01:03:21.513 --> 01:03:22.535]  I'm the same like him.
[01:03:22.655 --> 01:03:23.497]  I support him.
[01:03:23.577 --> 01:03:24.459]  I don't say enough.
[01:03:24.579 --> 01:03:25.601]  I don't do enough.
[01:03:26.362 --> 01:03:29.208]  Where I am, I'm working like a...
[01:03:30.194 --> 01:03:37.299]  Ask my Christmas staff, you know, who gives a f**k about Christmas stuff and decoration, but I need to do it, right?
[01:03:37.319 --> 01:03:40.481]  Yeah, but 100%, you have no choice.
[01:03:41.141 --> 01:03:48.887]  And okay, and then I do it, and I say that I'm working on Christmas, planning for the Christmas, and they say, oh, what about the children?
[01:03:48.907 --> 01:03:49.707]  They were separated.
[01:03:50.067 --> 01:03:50.728]  Give me a f**k.
[01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:51.128]  I know.
[01:03:51.148 --> 01:03:52.270]  But here's my thing.
[01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:54.132]  Did you hear what you just said?
[01:03:54.252 --> 01:03:55.193]  But instead of that, if
[01:04:13.487 --> 01:04:16.889]  You just, your messaging, you were so loved.
[01:04:16.909 --> 01:04:19.191]  They would not do the story.
[01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:20.572]  We put it out.
[01:04:20.612 --> 01:04:22.813]  They would not do the story.
[01:04:22.833 --> 01:04:25.155]  You would not believe it.
[01:04:25.515 --> 01:04:35.501]  They would not do the story because they are against us because they are liberal media.
[01:04:35.582 --> 01:04:38.403]  Yeah, if I go to Fox, they will do the story.
[01:04:38.423 --> 01:04:39.524]  I don't want to go to Fox.
[01:04:40.024 --> 01:04:42.206]  Maybe Melania Trump should be the press secretary.
[01:04:43.951 --> 01:04:45.472]  Give them a tongue lashing every day.
[01:04:47.294 --> 01:04:49.255]  And they think that makes Melania Trump look bad?
[01:04:49.315 --> 01:04:51.737]  No, that's going to make her more popular than ever.
[01:04:52.057 --> 01:04:52.738]  And it already has.
[01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.580]  But look at the fake news media.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:57.061]  Look at these dirtbags.
[01:04:57.441 --> 01:04:58.762]  Look at Jim Acosta.
[01:04:59.303 --> 01:05:00.644]  What a scumbag.
[01:05:00.804 --> 01:05:07.549]  Even Chris Wallace has asked Trump three times now if he disavows white supremacists, and every time Trump has, and then Wallace says he still hasn't done it.
[01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:09.751]  What a dirtbag.
[01:05:10.431 --> 01:05:12.153]  Jim Acosta tweets this out.
[01:05:13.154 --> 01:05:16.195]  Trump has finally condemned white supremacists on Hannity.
[01:05:16.335 --> 01:05:16.935]  That was last night.
[01:05:18.095 --> 01:05:24.016]  Except it was Jim Acosta in 2017 that tweeted out Trump condemns KKK and white supremacists.
[01:05:27.377 --> 01:05:27.797]  Jim!
[01:05:30.138 --> 01:05:30.578]  Jim!
[01:05:32.718 --> 01:05:33.759]  These people are so fake.
[01:05:33.919 --> 01:05:34.839]  Here's another example.
[01:05:35.819 --> 01:05:39.140]  CNN contributor Asha Rangpapa
[01:05:40.612 --> 01:05:46.754]  She tweets out a response to Melania Trump and she's like, I can't stop focusing on why she's standing sideways.
[01:05:47.094 --> 01:05:50.215]  Folks, her Twitter picture is her standing sideways!
[01:05:50.515 --> 01:05:51.935]  You can't make this crap up!
[01:05:53.336 --> 01:06:01.898]  It's like she tried to mimic the stance of Melania Trump in her picture and then she did it for her picture and then she says, I can't believe Melania Trump stands sideways when she takes pictures.
[01:06:02.538 --> 01:06:03.558]  And then she's doing the same thing.
[01:06:04.579 --> 01:06:05.659]  These people have gone mad!
[01:06:09.667 --> 01:06:13.650]  We'll get into more of this COVID news when the doctor comes on.
[01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:17.192]  Yeah, Trump has condemned white supremacy more than any president in modern history.
[01:06:20.334 --> 01:06:21.514]  It's such a joke, man.
[01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:23.115]  It's such a joke.
[01:06:23.696 --> 01:06:26.257]  But you don't have to condemn Planned Parenthood that murders babies.
[01:06:26.277 --> 01:06:30.040]  You don't have to condemn Antifa or Black Lives Matter that's engaged in terrorism in the streets.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:30.860]  No, no, no, no.
[01:06:34.738 --> 01:06:37.139]  But now, you have to condemn QAnon.
[01:06:37.819 --> 01:06:40.940]  And this is actually being debated in the halls of Congress today.
[01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:43.341]  House Resolution 1154.
[01:06:46.842 --> 01:06:51.003]  Condemning QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy theories it promotes.
[01:06:51.784 --> 01:06:54.405]  Of course, the Democrat proposes this legislation.
[01:06:55.025 --> 01:06:56.945]  We must condemn QAnon.
[01:06:56.965 --> 01:06:58.806]  We must condemn free speech.
[01:07:01.547 --> 01:07:02.347]  Boy, oh boy.
[01:07:03.568 --> 01:07:03.928]  Meanwhile,
[01:07:06.195 --> 01:07:14.662]  North Carolina Democrat Senate candidate sexed messages with veteran's wife have just been leaked out on national file.
[01:07:14.962 --> 01:07:15.963]  No one's going to condemn that.
[01:07:17.184 --> 01:07:19.185]  But you've got to condemn the Proud Boys!
[01:07:20.086 --> 01:07:27.151]  And then when one Republican has a spine and says, no, I don't condemn the Proud Boys, defends them as patriotic masculinists.
[01:07:28.192 --> 01:07:29.994]  And that's Lauren Witski.
[01:07:30.074 --> 01:07:32.355]  So they hate Lauren Witski because she has a spine.
[01:07:32.535 --> 01:07:33.176]  She's courageous.
[01:07:33.456 --> 01:07:34.197]  She tells the truth.
[01:07:35.316 --> 01:07:41.879]  But then Lindsey Graham, a maggot, a MAGGOT comes out and says, We must condemn QAnon!
[01:07:42.359 --> 01:07:44.099]  Lindsey Graham, you are a MAGGOT!
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:53.263]  And Lauren Witski has more balls than Lindsey Graham has on his best day, watered down.
[01:07:53.283 --> 01:07:57.305]  Alright, no time to waste.
[01:07:57.845 --> 01:08:00.686]  Each caller can get 90 seconds maximum.
[01:08:01.366 --> 01:08:03.227]  Okay, Trump tested positive for COVID.
[01:08:04.295 --> 01:08:04.875]  No big deal.
[01:08:05.156 --> 01:08:05.936]  President's fine.
[01:08:06.036 --> 01:08:06.637]  Should be fine.
[01:08:06.677 --> 01:08:08.058]  But what's the distraction?
[01:08:08.078 --> 01:08:09.519]  What's the story behind this story?
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.181]  Has Trump laid a trap?
[01:08:11.241 --> 01:08:12.442]  Has Trump been set in a trap?
[01:08:12.582 --> 01:08:15.204]  Or is Trump accepting the new normal that COVID runs our lives?
[01:08:16.205 --> 01:08:19.047]  Let's begin with DeCarlo in D.C.
[01:08:19.107 --> 01:08:20.008]  DeCarlo, go ahead.
[01:08:21.209 --> 01:08:22.750]  Hey man, how you doing man?
[01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:23.891]  I love the show.
[01:08:23.951 --> 01:08:26.233]  I love Alex Jones, man.
[01:08:26.903 --> 01:08:27.964]  I'm black too, man.
[01:08:28.024 --> 01:08:29.505]  I'm a real Trump supporter, man.
[01:08:29.885 --> 01:08:36.350]  I've been supporting Trump before 2016 because I come from the messed up Democrat cities.
[01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:38.131]  Baltimore, D.C.
[01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:40.072]  I've been living in California.
[01:08:40.092 --> 01:08:46.097]  I went to prison under Kamala Harris being the Attorney General there.
[01:08:46.697 --> 01:08:51.520]  This whole thing, man, this COVID thing is like a little game, man.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.141]  I think Trump
[01:08:52.739 --> 01:08:54.580]  Trump, he knows what he's doing, man.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.701]  We just got this trust in him.
[01:08:56.741 --> 01:08:59.523]  He knows what he's doing, man.
[01:08:59.863 --> 01:09:01.184]  He's really draining the swamp.
[01:09:01.264 --> 01:09:05.046]  That's what I think going on here with the COVID thing.
[01:09:05.567 --> 01:09:06.267]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:09:06.307 --> 01:09:07.708]  He's draining the swamp, man.
[01:09:07.928 --> 01:09:16.293]  So you think Trump is going to use this massive gravity towards him and anything he says right now to use it for good and drain the swamp?
[01:09:17.304 --> 01:09:17.524]  Right.
[01:09:17.784 --> 01:09:31.235]  But see, the thing about it is, we need to make sure that they didn't try to do anything to him because he was around Biden for that, when they did that little debate.
[01:09:31.715 --> 01:09:35.198]  So it's like, you know, we got to be real, real careful because
[01:09:35.774 --> 01:09:37.435]  Hey, how's it going, bro?
[01:09:37.555 --> 01:09:39.997]  I think Trump's just reorganizing his
[01:10:04.892 --> 01:10:09.256]  You know, creating some more plans to defeat those, you know, idiots.
[01:10:10.056 --> 01:10:20.785]  But, uh, last time when I went to his rally, you know, he was pretty energized, but, you know, you can see him, uh, tired.
[01:10:21.165 --> 01:10:29.772]  But, you know, it's a good time for him to organize, uh, create some more plans to defeat all those, you know, swamp people.
[01:10:30.733 --> 01:10:33.916]  And then me, myself, you know, I'm a Russian big
[01:10:34.628 --> 01:10:36.389]  You know, huge supporter of Trump.
[01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:41.012]  I'm actually became a citizen just because of the Trump.
[01:10:41.252 --> 01:10:51.099]  You know, I've lived here for 19 years and then this is, I became like, you know, super patriot of this country and I love it.
[01:10:52.399 --> 01:10:56.142]  But I think he's creating some more plans to defeat those guys.
[01:10:57.142 --> 01:10:57.882]  Well, I hope so.
[01:10:58.423 --> 01:11:00.044]  That's what he needs to be doing right now.
[01:11:00.504 --> 01:11:01.665]  Max, thank you so much for the call.
[01:11:02.045 --> 01:11:09.650]  By the way, when Trump was in Minnesota, I guess it was two nights ago, he was throwing out hats and stuff to the crowd, so they'll probably use that against him, say he spread COVID, put him in jail or something.
[01:11:10.671 --> 01:11:12.152]  David in Arizona, go ahead.
[01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:15.191]  Hi, Owen.
[01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:20.695]  Basically, what I think's going on is Trump's just using this as a play-action fake.
[01:11:21.056 --> 01:11:27.861]  In other words, he might use this to show that hydroxychloroquine works and that we actually don't need Gates' vaccine.
[01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:31.163]  Or a lockdown, or a mask, or anything.
[01:11:32.043 --> 01:11:32.624]  Exactly.
[01:11:32.644 --> 01:11:39.769]  So I'm hoping that's what it is, but worst-case scenario, you know, hopefully he's not, you know, defending the swamp.
[01:11:39.849 --> 01:11:42.311]  But, you know, of course, nobody wants to think that, so...
[01:11:42.867 --> 01:11:48.352]  You know, hopefully it's just a play-action fake in its political theater, you know, in order to shut down this vaccine.
[01:11:49.893 --> 01:11:51.174]  All right, David, thanks for the call.
[01:11:51.214 --> 01:11:52.655]  Miguel in Indiana.
[01:11:52.716 --> 01:11:53.656]  Miguel, what do you think?
[01:11:55.558 --> 01:11:56.499]  Owen, can you hear me?
[01:11:56.819 --> 01:11:57.019]  Yep.
[01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:09.410]  Owen, what this is, I'm pretty sure Trump wants to beef up his security detail with healthcare-looking people.
[01:12:11.605 --> 01:12:13.807]  This is just a fake coming from Trump.
[01:12:14.328 --> 01:12:22.615]  He wants to beef up his security detail with more bodyguards looking like nurses and doctors.
[01:12:23.235 --> 01:12:26.498]  Because I'm pretty sure he got massive threats from the left.
[01:12:27.359 --> 01:12:31.663]  I used to work for the Deep State and spend some time in jail because of that.
[01:12:32.163 --> 01:12:33.244]  That's all I can say now.
[01:12:34.385 --> 01:12:34.746]  Thank you.
[01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:36.127]  Thank you for taking my call, Owen.
[01:12:36.867 --> 01:12:38.289]  And God bless you all.
[01:12:39.244 --> 01:12:39.844]  Very interesting.
[01:12:39.884 --> 01:12:40.444]  Thank you, Miguel.
[01:12:40.604 --> 01:12:42.505]  Let's go to Kevin in Alabama.
[01:12:42.545 --> 01:12:43.385]  Kevin, what do you think?
[01:12:44.545 --> 01:12:45.446]  Hey, Owen.
[01:12:46.066 --> 01:12:48.886]  Retired Air Force F-16 crew chief here.
[01:12:50.067 --> 01:12:51.607]  Here's what I think, man.
[01:12:53.187 --> 01:12:58.269]  I think President Trump is just playing the ultimate checkmate.
[01:12:59.469 --> 01:13:07.351]  I think that maybe it's possible that he may wait about two weeks from now and resign.
[01:13:09.464 --> 01:13:13.545]  And all the Russian collusion, all the Hillary, all the Pelosi crap goes away.
[01:13:14.466 --> 01:13:16.006]  Pence is put on the ballot.
[01:13:16.587 --> 01:13:21.268]  It negates all the other ballots that have been messed with with Trump's name on them.
[01:13:22.168 --> 01:13:23.089]  They all go away.
[01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:26.250]  Everybody's watching Ilhan Omar right now.
[01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:28.111]  They got too much light on them.
[01:13:28.691 --> 01:13:30.011]  They won't have time to cheat.
[01:13:31.412 --> 01:13:33.652]  And Pence wins in a landslide.
[01:13:34.393 --> 01:13:35.213]  We get what we want.
[01:13:35.956 --> 01:13:37.217]  The left gets what they want.
[01:13:37.277 --> 01:13:37.958]  Trump's gone.
[01:13:38.398 --> 01:13:39.919]  The man can live his life in peace.
[01:13:40.319 --> 01:13:42.801]  We can get back to some kind of normal existence.
[01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:44.162]  That's what I think.
[01:13:45.303 --> 01:13:45.963]  Alright, Kevin.
[01:13:45.983 --> 01:13:46.724]  Thank you for the call.
[01:13:47.184 --> 01:13:49.006]  Let's go to Stephen in Florida.
[01:13:49.046 --> 01:13:49.806]  Stephen, go ahead.
[01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:52.468]  Yeah, here's my take.
[01:13:52.909 --> 01:13:53.809]  A couple things.
[01:13:53.949 --> 01:13:54.570]  First of all,
[01:13:55.473 --> 01:14:06.259]  I would love it if Greg Reese or John Bowne or whoever, one of your great researchers, would research to find out who is responsible for having Trump tested.
[01:14:06.279 --> 01:14:10.482]  I can almost guarantee you're going to find a connection between that
[01:14:11.142 --> 01:14:15.205]  To Biden and the Democrats, or even Gates and Fauci.
[01:14:15.765 --> 01:14:25.492]  Now, that being said, Trump has been handed a golden opportunity here to diffuse this whole coronavirus scandemic.
[01:14:25.892 --> 01:14:40.042]  Because if he does his research and gets his ducks in line, he can come out and say, I've got credible evidence proving that this whole thing is a hoax as far as the way it's being presented to the American public.
[01:14:40.686 --> 01:14:41.969]  Now let me also say this.
[01:14:43.472 --> 01:14:47.459]  Here's what Trump really needs to get across with this election campaign.
[01:14:48.441 --> 01:14:52.149]  This is a statement I wrote out and I'd really love to hear him say something like this.
[01:14:53.167 --> 01:15:07.438]  I have come to this point in time, this juncture in the history of our nation and the world, to say that as Mr. Biden and I face off in this election, let it be known that each one of us embodies what we stand for and what we represent.
[01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:12.722]  The battle of good versus evil, right versus wrong, truth versus lies.
[01:15:13.182 --> 01:15:21.268]  I therefore stand here today stating unequivocally and absolutely my wholehearted support of what the founders of America envisioned
[01:15:21.468 --> 01:15:28.413]  Yeah, and it's basically whatever Trump does next is going to receive so much momentum, so much attention, he has to knock it out of the park.
[01:15:28.913 --> 01:15:29.434]  Exactly.
[01:15:29.974 --> 01:15:30.455]  J.D.
[01:15:30.615 --> 01:15:31.675]  in Missouri, go ahead.
[01:15:33.197 --> 01:15:34.397]  Hey Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[01:15:34.778 --> 01:15:36.599]  Quick shout out to the crew for all the hours you're working.
[01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:40.662]  I'm really hoping that Trump's setting up a trap.
[01:15:41.262 --> 01:15:48.307]  Hopefully he'll take another test and try and shine a spotlight on the false positives and maybe hopefully get Fauci out of there.
[01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:49.929]  Because think about what that does.
[01:15:50.638 --> 01:15:58.685]  If Trump takes another test and shows negative and then it comes out as a negative or a bad result, a false positive, then it just destroys everything.
[01:15:58.825 --> 01:15:59.926]  It just destroys everything.
[01:16:00.086 --> 01:16:04.169]  Now the kicker of that is it won't matter because everything's already been destroyed and yet we're still here.
[01:16:04.549 --> 01:16:09.693]  But if the President does it in that light, with that attention, with the momentum, maybe it makes a different impact.
[01:16:10.434 --> 01:16:10.614]  Right.
[01:16:11.235 --> 01:16:18.961]  And a quick note, I think we should start spelling Fauci's name with an X instead of a C. It'll be F-A-U-X-I because he's
[01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:22.540]  Not a very good doctor, is my opinion.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.340]  Hopefully he uses us to take out some of the deep state.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.901]  I don't know.
[01:16:27.981 --> 01:16:28.941]  He might be getting set up.
[01:16:29.481 --> 01:16:30.181]  Might be a bit of both.
[01:16:30.201 --> 01:16:31.541]  I don't know.
[01:16:32.162 --> 01:16:42.224]  It's just hard to believe that it's just a coincidental or happenstance or just a normal thing with 31 days to the election and this is just such a game-changing thing or has the potential to be.
[01:16:42.484 --> 01:16:43.664]  Alright, let's squeeze in one last call.
[01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:45.104]  Joey in California, real quick.
[01:16:46.325 --> 01:16:47.405]  Hey Owen, how's it going?
[01:16:47.985 --> 01:16:48.145]  Good.
[01:16:49.952 --> 01:16:56.516]  So it's possible that he's proving that the human body knows how to take care of something like this.
[01:16:58.177 --> 01:17:14.525]  I have a kidney transplant so I take immunosuppressive drugs and the doctors strictly warn against taking Chinese medicine because it boosts the immune system and they want to keep my body from attacking my transplant.
[01:17:15.105 --> 01:17:16.506]  What is that telling you in a verse?
[01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:18.287]  That they know that these things work.
[01:17:20.234 --> 01:17:22.456]  Yeah, they know they work.
[01:17:22.516 --> 01:17:25.439]  Fauci's prescribed people hydroxychloroquine.
[01:17:25.459 --> 01:17:26.140]  He's written about it.
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:27.681]  Obama was on hydroxychloroquine.
[01:17:27.741 --> 01:17:28.162]  Absolutely.
[01:17:28.202 --> 01:17:29.043]  Thank you for the call, Joey.
[01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:29.303]  Wow.
[01:17:29.683 --> 01:17:31.845]  We had nine calls for that segment, folks.
[01:17:32.446 --> 01:17:33.107]  Nine calls.
[01:17:33.527 --> 01:17:37.331]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us back in studio in a very short amount of time.
[01:17:37.731 --> 01:17:38.352]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:17:43.418 --> 01:17:43.978]  Good morning.
[01:17:44.078 --> 01:17:48.542]  Obviously we had a great jobs report this morning.
[01:17:48.662 --> 01:17:59.790]  Unemployment down below 8% and the economy continues to be robust in its v-shaped recovery and unfortunately that's not what everybody's focused on this morning.
[01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:02.552]  As all of you know the
[01:18:04.071 --> 01:18:08.813]  The President and the First Lady tested positive for COVID-19.
[01:18:09.914 --> 01:18:11.454]  They remain in good spirits.
[01:18:13.035 --> 01:18:21.059]  The President does have mild symptoms and as we look to try to make sure that
[01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:28.543]  Not only his health and safety and welfare is good, we continue to look at that for all of the American people.
[01:18:30.104 --> 01:18:33.707]  He continues to be not only in good spirits, but very energetic.
[01:18:34.167 --> 01:18:37.409]  We've talked a number of times this morning.
[01:18:37.509 --> 01:18:42.852]  I got the five or six things that he had tasked me to do like I do every single morning.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:49.903]  He is certainly wanting to make sure that we stay engaged.
[01:18:49.983 --> 01:18:59.610]  I think the other thing that is critically important, the doctors continue to monitor both his health and the health of the First Lady.
[01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:01.871]  We'll continue to do that.
[01:19:01.911 --> 01:19:10.036]  They'll be glad to provide some updates later today as we look at this, but I think the
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:19.746]  The great thing about this president is not only is he staying committed to working very hard on behalf of the American people.
[01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:23.629]  His first question to me this morning was...
[01:19:25.831 --> 01:19:27.914]  How's the economy doing?
[01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:31.358]  How are the stimulus talks going on Capitol Hill?
[01:19:32.179 --> 01:19:44.474]  A number of us in the core team of the White House continue to get tested on a daily basis like we are, like we have been, and as we look to that
[01:19:46.156 --> 01:20:09.297]  We're very excited about making sure that not only that the health and safety of the President and the First Lady is addressed, but certainly that we address this battle together as a nation, together, and the American people can rest assured that we have a President that
[01:20:11.977 --> 01:20:14.118]  It's Friday, October 2nd.
[01:20:14.299 --> 01:20:17.120]  31 days out from the historic election.
[01:20:19.142 --> 01:20:21.283]  CNN says 32, Fox says 31.
[01:20:21.363 --> 01:20:24.345]  It's 31 days until Election Day.
[01:20:24.365 --> 01:20:26.527]  32 until the real chaos kicks in.
[01:20:26.547 --> 01:20:31.190]  If you count November 3rd and the 79 days of hell starts.
[01:20:32.833 --> 01:20:42.540]  It wasn't very hard back in March to predict that they would say that Trump got COVID-19 either with a real COVID-19 he got or with a false test, which is the most common thing to happen.
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:43.301]  That's a fact.
[01:20:44.161 --> 01:20:56.170]  Or they have COVID-type chimeras that COVID-19 is a platform for, that they can then implant a more deadly viral effect.
[01:20:56.970 --> 01:21:01.394]  But then they'll also know, because they've genetically engineered it, that when it mutates,
[01:21:02.637 --> 01:21:03.658]  We will no longer be deadly.
[01:21:04.578 --> 01:21:07.079]  So, the problem with bioweapons is they blow back on you.
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:10.021]  Even race-specific ones.
[01:21:11.181 --> 01:21:15.964]  They can now tailor bioweapons down to a very individual if they can get some of your DNA.
[01:21:17.124 --> 01:21:25.849]  And so, I've been really worried about designer COVID, which will then show up on the toe tag of President Trump if they're able to kill him with it.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:31.862]  And then that adds the fear and adds the hysteria, though statistically it doesn't kill a lot of people.
[01:21:32.222 --> 01:21:34.782]  They have a tailored COVID-19 for the president.
[01:21:35.283 --> 01:21:36.643]  You know, I said that back in March.
[01:21:37.863 --> 01:21:43.645]  Knowing what COVID-19 was, knowing how the enemy operates, that was a prime projection.
[01:21:43.705 --> 01:21:45.326]  That was a possibility.
[01:21:45.366 --> 01:21:48.807]  That was not a prediction as much.
[01:21:49.987 --> 01:21:52.988]  But the six minutes of me talking about it in detail is at Band.video.
[01:21:54.266 --> 01:22:13.471]  Right now, Alex Jones predicted President Trump would get COVID, but actually what I said was, is I postulated that he could get it, and they could use it as the cover to either poison him, and then just a regular COVID virus didn't really kill him, but they say it's the cause of death, or they could load it up with a weaponized COVID.
[01:22:13.951 --> 01:22:14.791]  Because I want to explain something.
[01:22:16.091 --> 01:22:22.813]  COVID is a five virus HIV delivery system weapon platform.
[01:22:23.817 --> 01:22:31.499]  But if I have, in fact, ask one of the guys to open a safe and give me a Glock 9mm of some type, unloaded though.
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.560]  But I want the magazine.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.581]  Because that's the allegory.
[01:22:36.441 --> 01:22:38.221]  COVID-19 is the Glock.
[01:22:39.442 --> 01:22:42.143]  The magazine with the bullets is what they load into it.
[01:22:42.783 --> 01:22:44.403]  COVID-19 is an aircraft carrier.
[01:22:45.444 --> 01:22:47.124]  COVID-19 is a delivery system.
[01:22:47.424 --> 01:22:48.004]  Think of it this way.
[01:22:49.205 --> 01:22:49.465]  COVID-19
[01:22:51.405 --> 01:22:53.930]  Is the powder and is the shell casing.
[01:22:54.751 --> 01:22:56.434]  And then what they load into it is the bullet.
[01:22:59.079 --> 01:23:12.262]  And when I looked at it and read all the signs, they're saying they're like, this looks like what we had with H1N1 when we learned the year before, they put an attenuated H1N1 that was still alive in the flu shot the year before to track it in a big global test.
[01:23:12.722 --> 01:23:15.883]  But then they said, oh, but it turns out the simulant did get some people sick.
[01:23:15.963 --> 01:23:16.403]  Well, no.
[01:23:16.963 --> 01:23:25.346]  When people died of other causes, pneumonia, another flu, other natural causes, heart attack, cancer, they would then say it was H1N1.
[01:23:27.446 --> 01:23:30.308]  So H1N1 was the first big simulant.
[01:23:31.109 --> 01:23:39.034]  And it even came out in medical literature that they put H1N1 attenuated in the vaccine the year before as part of a global herd immunity test.
[01:23:39.475 --> 01:23:43.738]  So they're guinea pigging people and admitting all this.
[01:23:43.798 --> 01:23:50.382]  And so when I saw COVID, I said, wait a minute, it's a weapons platform because they're easily able to then
[01:23:51.468 --> 01:23:57.411]  Create a certain mutation variety of it that, again, is way more deadly, but has a very short half-life.
[01:23:57.952 --> 01:24:08.958]  I don't mean that in a truly radiological term, but in its mutations, they've already in a lab mutated it because it's engineered, and they know it'll mutate to not be harmful once it's been in its host subject.
[01:24:09.238 --> 01:24:15.882]  But for the first gen, for the first person who breathes it or it's sprayed on, like Trump, it's extremely deadly.
[01:24:16.262 --> 01:24:19.404]  Now, I'm not saying that's what's happened, but Trump could be dead in two days.
[01:24:22.913 --> 01:24:26.596]  People are saying, oh, he staged this to make it look like he's a man of the people.
[01:24:27.116 --> 01:24:31.960]  No, when I found out that Boris Johnson, people that I know that were around, they said he did have trouble breathing, got really sick.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:35.703]  Well, they obviously just sprayed some real weaponized COVID in his face.
[01:24:36.223 --> 01:24:37.324]  They tried to get Bolsonaro.
[01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:38.505]  Hell, they already stabbed him in the stomach.
[01:24:39.005 --> 01:24:41.787]  So if you've got people not going along, see how this is a perfect cover.
[01:24:42.047 --> 01:24:47.932]  While there's COVID hysteria, then you can have targeted assassinations with your souped up COVID.
[01:24:48.672 --> 01:24:54.678]  That, again, after it hits first phase mutation, it's like a terminator seed, it's no longer deadly.
[01:24:55.318 --> 01:24:58.441]  Again, I always go back to terminator seeds, that's their archetype for all of this.
[01:24:59.862 --> 01:25:03.826]  You get the seed, it grows one soybean plant, but can't produce seeds that produce another plant.
[01:25:03.966 --> 01:25:05.828]  You have to go back to the factory to get the engineered.
[01:25:06.388 --> 01:25:07.089]  Same thing with COVID.
[01:25:07.409 --> 01:25:13.114]  They have got thousands of varieties now, they know, some super deadly, some not, but they find the deadly ones burn out real fast.
[01:25:13.991 --> 01:25:21.456]  Well, that's because they've already tested the permutations of it and they've already know how it basically is going to operate.
[01:25:23.077 --> 01:25:25.559]  So again, they can poison him and then say COVID killed him.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:27.661]  It could be a false test.
[01:25:27.741 --> 01:25:28.741]  Most of them are false.
[01:25:30.282 --> 01:25:31.703]  And that way he needs another test.
[01:25:31.743 --> 01:25:32.964]  That should be a top story.
[01:25:33.044 --> 01:25:33.885]  Is he being tested again?
[01:25:36.587 --> 01:25:41.230]  Or again, it's a real bioweapon and they've already assassinated the president.
[01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:42.411]  He's walking dead right now.
[01:25:43.717 --> 01:25:45.818]  And boy, that'll really help with the permanent lockdown, won't it?
[01:25:46.479 --> 01:25:48.960]  And the whole conspiracy theory, assassinations never happen.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.162]  Assassinations are part of history with kings and emperors and presidents and lords.
[01:25:53.582 --> 01:25:54.963]  A lot of our presidents have been shot.
[01:25:55.343 --> 01:25:56.484]  A lot of them have been assassinated.
[01:25:56.824 --> 01:25:58.925]  Now they have high-tech weapons in the 21st century.
[01:25:59.366 --> 01:26:08.350]  So I would be very, very, very concerned if that was everyone, because the media will say, oh, Jones says he's been assassinated, or Jones says it's a bioweapon, or Jones says it's a hoax.
[01:26:08.370 --> 01:26:08.410]  No.
[01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:15.935]  I'm wargaming for you the real possibilities and we've been proven right over and over again in the wide spectrum analysis.
[01:26:17.176 --> 01:26:30.844]  I don't know exactly what's going on but it was easy to predict that in all this hysteria they were gonna end up saying he had COVID and it's probably a false test and now he's saying well I kind of got a headache and some sniffles having some mild symptoms.
[01:26:31.344 --> 01:26:32.425]  Is that psychosomatic?
[01:26:34.943 --> 01:26:38.185]  You know, the bad placebo, like you take a sugar pill, you think you're better.
[01:26:38.546 --> 01:26:39.787]  Oh, people are sick around you.
[01:26:40.527 --> 01:26:50.014]  You've seen responses where someone throws up and so you feel sick and throw up even though you haven't eaten the bad fish they ate.
[01:26:50.094 --> 01:26:51.996]  Those are sympathetic responses.
[01:26:53.657 --> 01:26:56.018]  There's a lot of these and the average person isn't aware of it.
[01:26:56.239 --> 01:27:00.542]  So is Trump having a sympathetic response to a regular cold or flu going around the White House?
[01:27:02.728 --> 01:27:03.748]  Is it a false test?
[01:27:04.409 --> 01:27:05.329]  Has he been poisoned?
[01:27:05.849 --> 01:27:07.850]  Will they say he died of COVID, he dies of something else?
[01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:09.490]  That's how I do it.
[01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:10.791]  That's the easiest way.
[01:27:10.811 --> 01:27:15.412]  You just poison him right after you say he has the positive COVID test.
[01:27:15.432 --> 01:27:17.273]  Because they're going around testing the whole White House all the time.
[01:27:18.093 --> 01:27:18.773]  And so, oh, boom!
[01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:19.874]  Test positive.
[01:27:19.894 --> 01:27:21.854]  9 out of 10 tests are fake.
[01:27:22.294 --> 01:27:23.775]  Now they slip him.
[01:27:25.117 --> 01:27:27.980]  The synthetic poison that'll cause him to have a heart attack.
[01:27:28.361 --> 01:27:29.342]  It'll metabolize out.
[01:27:29.362 --> 01:27:30.463]  They won't be able to find it in the blood.
[01:27:31.024 --> 01:27:33.046]  But now they're creeping in with the weapons.
[01:27:33.086 --> 01:27:35.569]  Trump could be dead in hours if that's the scenario.
[01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:39.413]  Well, we'll discuss it all coming up in hour number three.
[01:27:39.433 --> 01:27:40.454]  Got a big special guest.
[01:27:40.894 --> 01:27:42.276]  Infowars.com.
[01:27:42.536 --> 01:27:43.718]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:49.293]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[01:27:49.313 --> 01:27:50.494]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:27:50.734 --> 01:27:52.035]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[01:27:52.215 --> 01:27:53.596]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[01:27:53.716 --> 01:27:54.737]  I want them shut down.
[01:27:54.797 --> 01:27:55.698]  I want them silenced.
[01:27:55.758 --> 01:27:56.538]  I want them muted.
[01:27:56.598 --> 01:27:58.360]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.320]  You kept us on air.
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.741]  We did the analysis first.
[01:28:01.022 --> 01:28:02.042]  It's now gone mainstream.
[01:28:02.102 --> 01:28:03.904]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[01:28:04.184 --> 01:28:10.069]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:11.710]  You need to stop right now.
[01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:12.891]  And they're very, very serious.
[01:28:13.012 --> 01:28:15.474]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[01:28:15.514 --> 01:28:16.575]  It's not gonna happen.
[01:28:16.595 --> 01:28:18.277]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[01:28:18.718 --> 01:28:21.160]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:22.902]  Save yourself, save the world.
[01:28:23.222 --> 01:28:24.083]  We're in this together.
[01:28:24.163 --> 01:28:25.164]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:28:25.825 --> 01:28:26.805]  Communism's up here.
[01:28:27.005 --> 01:28:29.966]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[01:28:30.366 --> 01:28:32.166]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[01:28:32.386 --> 01:28:33.926]  My children are right here!
[01:28:34.667 --> 01:28:36.407]  But I need money to fight a war!
[01:28:36.607 --> 01:28:37.647]  And I need word of mouth!
[01:28:37.867 --> 01:28:38.767]  And I need prayer!
[01:28:38.907 --> 01:28:39.867]  And I need action!
[01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:41.848]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[01:28:42.548 --> 01:28:44.528]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[01:28:45.448 --> 01:28:49.129]  Here's my analysis in Wargaming.
[01:28:50.029 --> 01:28:54.330]  Back in March of this year, a good six months ago, here it is.
[01:28:56.758 --> 01:29:11.287]  Trump set to declare a national emergency, and then the sub-headline at Infowars.com is the fact that the deep state wants to assassinate Trump and blame it on coronavirus.
[01:29:11.427 --> 01:29:22.053]  Oh, make no mistake, the ether has been swimming with that for about a week here at the office, and I wasn't ready to go to it until Wednesday.
[01:29:23.937 --> 01:29:29.520]  And then I came up here last night to shoot a video on it and I didn't get it done because I was dealing with other stuff.
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:31.201]  There's a lot going on.
[01:29:32.301 --> 01:29:37.423]  But I will talk about that at the start of the next segment.
[01:29:37.463 --> 01:29:42.626]  But can we pull up on InfoWars.com, the main feed of the show?
[01:29:43.846 --> 01:29:51.410]  If you just go to InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com and you'll see the live feed of the show right there and it says Trump said
[01:30:00.419 --> 01:30:03.680]  Well, that's quite a claim.
[01:30:05.261 --> 01:30:13.863]  It's like the claim we said six weeks ago that they're going to, that the virus comes back, like HIV, over and over again and you can't get rid of it.
[01:30:14.023 --> 01:30:17.084]  Oh, that's now Reuters AP.
[01:30:19.625 --> 01:30:20.165]  Everything today.
[01:30:23.566 --> 01:30:23.946]  Truth is,
[01:30:25.695 --> 01:30:28.036]  The globalist problem is they're science.
[01:30:28.477 --> 01:30:32.519]  So they can use science for evil, but there are other institutions and universities and people that aren't evil.
[01:30:32.999 --> 01:30:34.720]  They go and they look and they tell us this.
[01:30:35.821 --> 01:30:37.522]  And they're like, shut up, it's not true!
[01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:39.943]  Shut up, University of Wisconsin.
[01:30:40.043 --> 01:30:41.564]  Shut up, University of New Delhi.
[01:30:42.004 --> 01:30:44.926]  Shut up, you know, University in Switzerland.
[01:30:44.946 --> 01:30:50.369]  We're like, hey, this thing has HIV delivery system.
[01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:54.650]  Oh, shut up!
[01:30:54.730 --> 01:30:58.198]  And like, oh yeah, HIV, drugs, treat it!
[01:30:58.218 --> 01:31:00.142]  People are like, well, Alex said that six weeks ago.
[01:31:01.977 --> 01:31:03.778]  And again, it's not that we're that smart.
[01:31:04.498 --> 01:31:05.879]  We understand how stuff works.
[01:31:06.279 --> 01:31:07.119]  Everyone's not evil.
[01:31:07.899 --> 01:31:09.300]  Everyone's not involved in a conspiracy.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:20.304]  That's the globalist problem, is there's all these professional classes and all these smart people that are out there that actually have studied things and they know what they're seeing, and they're going, hey, this is manufactured.
[01:31:20.324 --> 01:31:21.144]  And they're like, shut up!
[01:31:21.565 --> 01:31:22.685]  Shut up, you're funding's cut!
[01:31:22.725 --> 01:31:29.688]  And they're like, whoa, well, the university says I'm fired if I don't withdraw my paper and say it's wrong, but I'm not going to withdraw my paper and say it's wrong.
[01:31:31.513 --> 01:31:32.533]  I'll just withdraw my paper.
[01:31:33.774 --> 01:31:40.797]  And then three more universities come out and say, yeah, not only is this artificial, it's been weaponized.
[01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:55.843]  And that's really the big story, is that it's mutating, and it's the perfect cover for an off-the-shelf bioweapon that you can go and tweak parts of it
[01:31:57.065 --> 01:32:03.567]  And then release it on a certain group as race-specific, or even on an individual, and then it mutates and becomes harmless right after it.
[01:32:05.167 --> 01:32:06.728]  Has a very quick half-life.
[01:32:08.308 --> 01:32:08.829]  Think about that.
[01:32:10.389 --> 01:32:15.691]  The left is trying to parlay that the patriot president of Brazil has it, and that Trump has it.
[01:32:16.491 --> 01:32:20.012]  The Brazilian president has tested negative, the media is running with the fact that he has it.
[01:32:20.879 --> 01:32:23.581]  They're not talking about quarantining Trump, removing him from power.
[01:32:24.021 --> 01:32:29.284]  They could release a designer bioweapon on the president and say the coronavirus did it.
[01:32:29.925 --> 01:32:31.566]  That's something I'll cover at the bottom of the hour.
[01:32:31.586 --> 01:32:33.347]  I said I'd get to it earlier, but I got sidetracked.
[01:32:34.288 --> 01:32:48.617]  I wonder if that's going to be a precursor into maybe postponing the election, along with their posting pictures of Trump with these leaders who are positive or supposedly positive of coronavirus.
[01:32:49.631 --> 01:32:54.192]  Oh, they're 100% getting ready to say Trump has coronavirus, then kill him and say it killed him.
[01:32:54.712 --> 01:32:55.032]  That's it.
[01:32:55.132 --> 01:33:03.674]  Or, or, or the 25th Amendment, which he's disabled and can't run the country, and then bring Hillary on a broker convention.
[01:33:04.635 --> 01:33:11.696]  Notice they said that Brazil's Bolsonaro says he's tested negative, but he's really got the virus.
[01:33:12.716 --> 01:33:13.677]  And Trump's got it!
[01:33:14.437 --> 01:33:19.058]  So they can hit him with a bioweapon or whatever and say, oh, Trump died from coronavirus.
[01:33:20.484 --> 01:33:24.746]  And most people that Trump's come in contact with has had this virus.
[01:33:25.706 --> 01:33:28.807]  But I just find it funny that none of the Democrats have it.
[01:33:29.307 --> 01:33:32.629]  And at least if they do, I've not seen it come out yet.
[01:33:33.489 --> 01:33:34.909]  But I support the president.
[01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:36.270]  I'm actually worried about him.
[01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:38.571]  I know he's doing his best.
[01:33:38.651 --> 01:33:38.971]  He's 73.
[01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:45.073]  And I just don't know what's going to happen with him or this country.
[01:33:45.313 --> 01:33:46.814]  But this is a spiritual battle.
[01:33:48.183 --> 01:33:50.844]  It's all these celebrities and famous people, right?
[01:33:51.305 --> 01:33:54.646]  So I'm a little worried about Trump, like the other callers are saying.
[01:33:54.726 --> 01:33:59.709]  I think that this is just... That's what the whole office was like a week ago, and then I was like, oh, whatever.
[01:34:00.049 --> 01:34:05.231]  Then two days ago, it was like, everybody's like, no, it's an excuse to kill Trump and say it's a bioweapon.
[01:34:05.592 --> 01:34:06.832]  And that's where the clicking is on the news.
[01:34:06.892 --> 01:34:07.993]  It's like, he's got it.
[01:34:08.233 --> 01:34:08.893]  He's got it.
[01:34:09.193 --> 01:34:09.874]  Take him out.
[01:34:10.494 --> 01:34:10.914]  He didn't.
[01:34:10.954 --> 01:34:12.035]  He created it.
[01:34:12.395 --> 01:34:13.175]  He did it.
[01:34:13.355 --> 01:34:14.356]  And Trump's got it.
[01:34:15.524 --> 01:34:24.426]  Exactly, and I think because of his age and they say that he eats McDonald's and all that, they're just going to use it as an excuse to say that he was, you know, not healthy enough to fight it.
[01:34:24.446 --> 01:34:25.946]  Well, I know this.
[01:34:25.986 --> 01:34:32.487]  The group collective, the oracle of the people, is saying they're trying to poison Trump and give him the coronavirus.
[01:34:33.507 --> 01:34:35.888]  They're hyping it up massively.
[01:34:36.408 --> 01:34:39.108]  So that's what they're actually saying now.
[01:34:40.128 --> 01:34:42.969]  Yesterday I'm like, well, they blame him for corona and say he's got it.
[01:34:43.029 --> 01:34:43.969]  Now they're actually saying it.
[01:34:46.246 --> 01:34:48.787]  All right, I'm excited about our next guest.
[01:34:49.147 --> 01:34:50.527]  We're going to break, we're going to come back with her.
[01:34:50.548 --> 01:34:56.289]  She's a doctor and she's been speaking out about COVID and a lot of the things she said have been confirmed.
[01:34:57.030 --> 01:35:01.251]  A lot of other doctors have said similar things, they've been confirmed, but the media and the UN are trying to suppress it.
[01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:11.755]  She's talking about Humans 2.0 with this new DNA manipulating vaccines that they've got with Moderna and all the rest of them pushing this.
[01:35:13.024 --> 01:35:15.886]  And of the strangest of things happened to me today, and I have to leave it at that.
[01:35:18.048 --> 01:35:21.290]  I got some really interesting information from a very high level today.
[01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:29.576]  I'm not able to give you where the information came from, but it's one of the reasons that I was not on air in the last hour.
[01:35:31.277 --> 01:35:32.938]  And this is incredible information.
[01:35:33.419 --> 01:35:35.160]  And I think when I start the next hour,
[01:35:36.598 --> 01:35:40.382]  I'm going to get to as much of this as I can, but I'm almost speechless right now.
[01:35:40.402 --> 01:35:44.966]  Just trying to digest all of this as best I can.
[01:35:45.567 --> 01:35:46.167]  We'll be right back.
[01:35:46.247 --> 01:35:47.348]  Infowars.com.
[01:35:47.869 --> 01:35:48.750]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:35:51.243 --> 01:35:53.744]  Well, Dr. Carrie Made is our guest.
[01:35:53.784 --> 01:35:55.504]  We really appreciate her coming on.
[01:35:55.524 --> 01:36:06.388]  She's a medical doctor and her videos have been seen millions of times online when she came out and just read from what's in the mainline science that a bunch of these vaccines that Bill Gates and others are coming up with
[01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:13.934]  Are these mRNA vaccines that aren't what you'd call a vaccine where it teaches your body how to defeat something and creates an autoimmune response?
[01:36:13.954 --> 01:36:14.935]  It does something else.
[01:36:15.555 --> 01:36:25.083]  And so she called it, you know, Humans 2.0 and really Monsanto that has its own divisions in vaccine making, making you a GMO Franken creature.
[01:36:25.123 --> 01:36:27.925]  So we've already seen them do it with the soybeans and the corn and everything else.
[01:36:28.526 --> 01:36:29.707]  Now they're moving on to us.
[01:36:29.767 --> 01:36:30.808]  We've got President Trump.
[01:36:31.408 --> 01:36:31.588]  I don't
[01:36:54.176 --> 01:36:56.578]  Then how can they be sure about this?
[01:36:56.598 --> 01:36:58.499]  Why aren't we hearing about further tests?
[01:36:58.519 --> 01:36:59.600]  There's so much to cover.
[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:01.161]  I've been trying to get her on for about a month.
[01:37:01.241 --> 01:37:05.763]  It's perfect timing that she's been set up the last few days for now with all this coming out.
[01:37:05.804 --> 01:37:09.666]  So, Dr. Carey, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[01:37:10.006 --> 01:37:11.987]  Dr. Carey Maude is here with us.
[01:37:12.568 --> 01:37:13.508]  And where would you like to start?
[01:37:13.528 --> 01:37:15.470]  I've got so many questions with what's happening to Trump.
[01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:19.874]  With the lockdowns, with the numbers, some will say you're saying it's a hoax.
[01:37:19.894 --> 01:37:20.675]  You're not saying it's a hoax.
[01:37:20.695 --> 01:37:21.716]  You're saying it's overblown.
[01:37:22.917 --> 01:37:24.198]  They're now saying, look, Trump's got it.
[01:37:24.479 --> 01:37:25.700]  You guys said it was a hoax.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.280]  You're full of it.
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.062]  But we have the morbidity numbers.
[01:37:28.142 --> 01:37:29.383]  I mean, we have the facts.
[01:37:29.423 --> 01:37:31.946]  We know it's way overblown from what they originally told us.
[01:37:31.966 --> 01:37:33.508]  So where would you like to start, doctor?
[01:37:33.528 --> 01:37:34.709]  And we salute you for your courage.
[01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:37.071]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:37:37.111 --> 01:37:37.932]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:37:39.451 --> 01:37:42.617]  I guess, you know, start with the vaccine itself.
[01:37:43.138 --> 01:37:45.282]  And I've studied vaccines for
[01:37:46.383 --> 01:37:51.487]  You know, since my early 20s, because I was very concerned about them.
[01:37:51.988 --> 01:37:56.712]  And I'd like to say that the vaccines are not what we think they are.
[01:37:57.412 --> 01:38:02.257]  And a little story just to give some of your listeners some history of vaccines.
[01:38:03.137 --> 01:38:10.944]  The tetanus vaccine, when I studied that, there's a long story behind that, but it turns out really it's an abortion vaccine.
[01:38:12.463 --> 01:38:22.108]  It's been noted by the NIH, the NIH has admitted this, that there is a pregnancy hormone called the HCG hormone that is inside a lot of the vaccines.
[01:38:22.168 --> 01:38:25.289]  Now, I don't know if all of them have this, but many of them do.
[01:38:25.949 --> 01:38:36.874]  Latino countries, the Vatican has discovered this, that when a woman gets this vaccine, that when she gets pregnant, she can abort the baby quickly, okay?
[01:38:36.894 --> 01:38:38.215]  She would not even know she's pregnant.
[01:38:38.755 --> 01:38:40.296]  So this is not for tetanus.
[01:38:40.336 --> 01:38:42.336]  This is something, you know, different.
[01:38:42.376 --> 01:38:44.197]  This is an abortion vaccine.
[01:38:44.717 --> 01:38:46.618]  So they're outright lying to us.
[01:38:46.878 --> 01:38:52.800]  So if they're lying to us from decades ago, why do you think they're going to tell you the truth now?
[01:38:54.514 --> 01:38:57.897]  So that just goes into a little history of vaccines in general.
[01:38:58.318 --> 01:38:59.739]  So jump forward to this one.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:08.588]  I started researching this and I was horrified because we are using technology that has never been unveiled on the human race before.
[01:39:09.341 --> 01:39:21.630]  We are messing with the DNA, our genome, which makes us human, which it has the blueprint that makes us know how to reproduce, how to create, how to evolve, how to heal ourselves.
[01:39:22.151 --> 01:39:24.953]  And one tiny little, you know,
[01:39:25.834 --> 01:39:30.979]  Translocation, one little insert, one little deletion can make horrible effects.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:37.266]  You can be very sick, you can have mutations, you can have cancers, or turn into something else.
[01:39:37.326 --> 01:39:37.786]  We don't know.
[01:39:37.806 --> 01:39:39.288]  And make you sterile.
[01:39:40.322 --> 01:39:41.783]  So why are we doing this?
[01:39:41.843 --> 01:39:47.605]  Why are we rushing this vaccine with something that's brand new technology that we've never used before?
[01:39:48.265 --> 01:40:06.313]  So this is very, very concerning because I've attended a meeting, a scientific meeting with Dr. Craig Venter, who was one of the founders of the Human Genome Project, and he's still very involved with uploading genomes into the cloud and downloading them, mapping them out.
[01:40:06.997 --> 01:40:15.200]  He actually says that, you know, we can actually patent a gene or a genome of something that's synthetic.
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:26.085]  So technically, when we are getting a piece or this vaccine, and if it does become permanent within our genome, it's synthetic, that part of us can be patented and owned.
[01:40:26.584 --> 01:40:30.585]  People need to understand this because patents have owners.
[01:40:30.685 --> 01:40:31.385]  Who would own us?
[01:40:31.445 --> 01:40:32.546]  Who would own part of us?
[01:40:32.706 --> 01:40:33.826]  This is insane.
[01:40:34.286 --> 01:40:39.108]  No human should be owned, no part of a human should be owned, and this is my alarm call to the world.
[01:40:40.268 --> 01:40:54.672]  He also said, this scientist, researcher, said that in the genomes that they were patenting, he and the other scientists were putting their name into the genome, branding you already.
[01:40:55.976 --> 01:40:56.998]  This is unbelievable.
[01:40:57.618 --> 01:41:02.665]  So would an organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, would the Department of Defense own part of you?
[01:41:03.607 --> 01:41:04.908]  Who else could own part of you?
[01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:06.230]  What could they do with that?
[01:41:06.671 --> 01:41:09.515]  You need to understand this because this is the law right now.
[01:41:10.896 --> 01:41:15.098]  On top of that, they're trying to unveil technology with this vaccine.
[01:41:16.198 --> 01:41:22.440]  They haven't formally announced it, but in their studies, they're using nanotechnology, something called Hydrogel.
[01:41:23.881 --> 01:41:28.043]  They're also using, they want to brand you with something called Luciferase.
[01:41:28.363 --> 01:41:30.323]  It's an ID for ID 2020.
[01:41:30.484 --> 01:41:39.127]  And that would give you a unique identifier to make sure that you were vaccinated because they want to make sure everybody's vaccinated in the world.
[01:41:39.967 --> 01:41:45.589]  And with that ID, they can also hold your medical information, your vaccination record.
[01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:49.431]  It can gather your biometric information from your body.
[01:41:49.451 --> 01:41:57.894]  And also, with this nanotechnology, this ID, this can link you up to the internet of everything into the 5G cloud.
[01:41:58.435 --> 01:41:58.715]  Okay.
[01:41:59.515 --> 01:42:01.356]  So, why would they want to do that?
[01:42:01.476 --> 01:42:12.682]  Well, interestingly enough, they put a patent or they published a patent in March 26th of 2020 with the number 060606, an international patent.
[01:42:13.783 --> 01:42:24.089]  With this patent, of course, Microsoft published this, Bill and Linda Gates, they say that they could actually use these biometric data from your body
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:31.031]  And that would be hooked to cryptocurrency, meaning your body would then become your commodity.
[01:42:31.532 --> 01:42:38.204]  So you, your body would become your money, not your credit card anymore, not your cash, your body.
[01:42:39.426 --> 01:42:42.450]  We're talking about the ultimate enslavement of humanity.
[01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:45.713]  And we need to wake up and realize this is happening.
[01:42:46.154 --> 01:42:49.718]  If you want to, I encourage everyone, look this stuff up for yourself.
[01:42:49.778 --> 01:42:51.080]  Look up the patent numbers.
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:51.720]  They exist.
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:52.181]  They're there.
[01:42:52.201 --> 01:42:54.223]  And the same names keep coming up.
[01:42:54.624 --> 01:42:55.725]  The same people will keep
[01:42:56.479 --> 01:42:56.699]  We're good.
[01:43:13.789 --> 01:43:21.651]  Bill Gates will openly have the hydrogel, have the nanotech tracker chips, and we'll have MIT and everybody else saying, oh, we do this for Bill Gates.
[01:43:22.151 --> 01:43:30.833]  Then the media will try to discredit it by covering one program he's doing and claim that we're saying this program does that instead of the program we're talking about, and then try to discredit it.
[01:43:31.013 --> 01:43:37.594]  But then he'll be back in the news the next month going, oh, I do want to put an implantable liquid chip in your body to make sure you've had the vaccine.
[01:43:37.634 --> 01:43:41.755]  So they've got a real problem here because the world, as scary as all this is,
[01:43:42.815 --> 01:43:45.478]  I'm on the street, so I see it, and I know you're now well-known.
[01:43:45.858 --> 01:43:50.983]  People are really rejecting this across all cultural, racial, historic, and political lines.
[01:43:52.544 --> 01:43:55.147]  Yes, and you know, people tell me, oh, that won't happen.
[01:43:55.167 --> 01:43:55.827]  Well, guess what?
[01:43:55.887 --> 01:43:57.369]  It's already happening in Africa.
[01:43:57.809 --> 01:44:08.419]  MasterCard and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they are using this vaccine with the biometric ID with the children and the adults in Africa as we speak right now.
[01:44:09.377 --> 01:44:10.378]  You know, I saw that.
[01:44:10.558 --> 01:44:11.178]  I saw that.
[01:44:12.219 --> 01:44:12.900]  We go to break, guys.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:13.440]  Let's pull that up.
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:14.181]  I want to show people.
[01:44:14.461 --> 01:44:16.082]  And then I just forgot to even cover it.
[01:44:16.283 --> 01:44:22.908]  It's like we're all so conditioned now that this stuff is here in the third world and that means it's coming here next.
[01:44:22.948 --> 01:44:24.049]  This is so diabolical.
[01:44:25.999 --> 01:44:26.480]  I agree.
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:27.240]  I agree.
[01:44:28.081 --> 01:44:30.623]  The more you look into it, the more you'll find out more and more.
[01:44:30.683 --> 01:44:36.608]  DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is a huge player in this.
[01:44:37.029 --> 01:44:41.012]  People need to understand that they are behind transhumanism.
[01:44:42.513 --> 01:44:48.355]  And Elon Musk, who's now in the vaccine industry, he's been a proponent of transhumanism as well.
[01:44:48.555 --> 01:44:50.976]  Google, Ray Kurzweil, many people are.
[01:44:52.036 --> 01:44:58.978]  But the people that are pushing these vaccines, they are behind eugenics, meaning, you know, there's too many people on the planet.
[01:44:59.138 --> 01:45:00.379]  Let's get rid of some of us.
[01:45:01.239 --> 01:45:03.762]  And who's going to choose who stays, who goes?
[01:45:04.182 --> 01:45:09.728]  And then the rest of us, obviously, with all these technologies they're trying to roll out, they ultimately want to control us.
[01:45:09.908 --> 01:45:13.191]  All right, Dr. Carrie Madej, medical doctor, amazing lady.
[01:45:13.552 --> 01:45:16.995]  She's with us at Twitter, at Dr. Madej.
[01:45:17.396 --> 01:45:21.079]  That's M-A-D-E-J, YouTube, Dr. Carrie Madej.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.220]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:22.941]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:45:22.981 --> 01:45:23.482]  Stay with us.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.802]  Dr. Kari Maade is our guest.
[01:45:26.822 --> 01:45:27.722]  She's a medical doctor.
[01:45:27.742 --> 01:45:33.428]  You can read her whole background on YouTube at Dr. Kari Maade and on Twitter, Dr. Maade.
[01:45:33.448 --> 01:45:35.530]  That's M-A-D-E-J.
[01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:37.271]  On Facebook, Kari Maade.
[01:45:37.291 --> 01:45:40.895]  And she's got the SerendipityGroup.org.
[01:45:40.915 --> 01:45:42.536]  That's the most important spot.
[01:45:43.077 --> 01:45:43.977]  SerendipityGroup.org.
[01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:50.692]  Since you mentioned Elon Musk, we've got a short clip of him that we've never got to.
[01:45:50.712 --> 01:45:51.972]  I read the transcript on Monday.
[01:45:51.992 --> 01:45:57.034]  It's like an hour-long interview, but we've gotten down to three minutes where he really viciously attacks Bill Gates, which sounds good.
[01:45:57.654 --> 01:46:03.677]  And I know people that know Musk, and Musk tells them he's a listener, and he's made comments about the show before that are positive.
[01:46:03.697 --> 01:46:04.857]  So I want to think he's a good guy.
[01:46:04.877 --> 01:46:05.817]  I don't want to single him out.
[01:46:06.057 --> 01:46:09.539]  We know Gates is bad news from his own statements of wanting to depopulate, but
[01:46:10.359 --> 01:46:11.740]  Is he good cop, bad cop?
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:21.743]  Because he's pushing a vaccine company, he's pushing the satellites, the 5G, the brain chips, but then he's telling us Bill Gates is bad and that his COVID-19 vaccine is bad.
[01:46:22.043 --> 01:46:23.104]  What do you think is really going on there?
[01:46:24.684 --> 01:46:25.965]  I'm confused by him.
[01:46:26.045 --> 01:46:33.728]  He goes back and forth on his viewpoints and so I don't know what to make of him either, but I've got my eyes wide open on everybody.
[01:46:35.259 --> 01:46:35.919]  I agree.
[01:46:36.379 --> 01:46:41.741]  We hit the break and you were getting into the mRNA vaccines that shouldn't be called vaccines.
[01:46:41.761 --> 01:46:45.642]  They should be called genetic rewriting, which is what we call cancer.
[01:46:45.822 --> 01:46:50.284]  I mean, how they, in fact, I was researching studies they've done in animals with these.
[01:46:50.464 --> 01:46:54.005]  As you know, it kills a lot of them and it causes autoimmune issues.
[01:46:54.065 --> 01:47:00.327]  It makes the cells create proteins that are supposedly going to block viruses, but that can also mess up the chromosomes.
[01:47:00.627 --> 01:47:01.647]  I was reading about the
[01:47:01.647 --> 01:47:03.388]  The eighth chromosome being manipulated?
[01:47:03.848 --> 01:47:05.670]  Have you run into that as a medical doctor?
[01:47:05.710 --> 01:47:05.990]  Yes.
[01:47:07.111 --> 01:47:07.831]  Yes, yes.
[01:47:07.891 --> 01:47:10.493]  That has to do with your intellect, of course.
[01:47:12.274 --> 01:47:17.177]  If they manipulate that, they could potentially affect our intellect, among other things.
[01:47:17.257 --> 01:47:18.458]  It's quite important, right?
[01:47:18.578 --> 01:47:23.341]  And it says, yeah, right in the medical literature that, oh, this is fertility and intellect.
[01:47:25.663 --> 01:47:25.723]  Yes.
[01:47:25.783 --> 01:47:25.883]  Wow.
[01:47:26.707 --> 01:47:31.750]  Yes, they've already been manipulating our fertility, like I said, with the tetanus vaccine and perhaps other ones as well.
[01:47:33.691 --> 01:47:35.272]  So we need to be on the lookout for this.
[01:47:35.312 --> 01:47:46.458]  But I would like to say, even if you don't want to believe any of the fantastical things I just said, just know this, that for the last 20 years, they have done research with this kind of vaccine only on animals.
[01:47:47.196 --> 01:47:50.719]  And in the animal studies, they looked like it was a success.
[01:47:50.979 --> 01:47:53.221]  Okay, the animals had a robust immune system.
[01:47:53.301 --> 01:47:54.922]  They had a great T cell response.
[01:47:55.002 --> 01:47:55.302]  Great.
[01:47:55.863 --> 01:48:00.206]  But then they did a challenge test, which is unethical to do in humans, but they can do a challenge test.
[01:48:00.826 --> 01:48:02.648]  And I should have opened the show up with this.
[01:48:03.789 --> 01:48:09.153]  Because when they did the challenge test, it caused a horrible autoimmune response.
[01:48:10.563 --> 01:48:16.647]  To whatever the outside pathogen was, and that is exactly the information I came into receipt of today.
[01:48:17.087 --> 01:48:20.189]  Serendipity, synchronicity, providence.
[01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:22.311]  What have I told you?
[01:48:22.391 --> 01:48:27.094]  I ran into the head scientist at one of the major biotech labs.
[01:48:28.955 --> 01:48:34.278]  Didn't know who he was, found out, researched what he was saying, and it was all true.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:38.401]  And what did he tell me?
[01:48:40.606 --> 01:48:41.307]  He told me a lot.
[01:48:42.708 --> 01:48:43.769]  What does the information tell me?
[01:48:48.492 --> 01:49:00.622]  If you take a vaccine for COVID-19, its main platform is a regular cold virus, with a bunch of stuff stacked onto it, genetic traits stacked on, called stacking.
[01:49:03.424 --> 01:49:04.205]  If you do that,
[01:49:05.936 --> 01:49:09.939]  And then your body learns to have an autoimmune response to that particular virus.
[01:49:10.019 --> 01:49:22.608]  It's so broad, you will now have an autoimmune response to the regular coronavirus that's so common it's everywhere, making it where you can't even go outside because you'll get so sick from regular cold viruses.
[01:49:22.688 --> 01:49:27.551]  And so they're trying to get rid of your immunity to the cold virus, but not just your immunity.
[01:49:27.591 --> 01:49:29.853]  They're trying to make it where you're allergic to it.
[01:49:30.253 --> 01:49:30.593]  We're good to go.
[01:49:49.059 --> 01:49:53.640]  That's why they can't get an immunity with COVID patients and why it comes back because it's so weak.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:58.361]  The body doesn't even see it as a threat and won't create immunity to it.
[01:49:58.641 --> 01:50:05.522]  So they have to soup it up and add things to the vaccine that you're also allergic to so you have an autoimmune response to both with the adjuvant.
[01:50:06.763 --> 01:50:17.185]  But then just like they used to grow vaccines on peanuts, so suddenly kids that ate peanuts would die because their body saw that as an outside pathogen because they've been given it in the flu shot or whatever it was they got when they were younger.
[01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:19.510]  And so they know what they're doing.
[01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:21.951]  They are jacking with us hard, folks.
[01:50:22.791 --> 01:50:26.772]  And I'm talking to a head of a biotech lab, major one.
[01:50:26.852 --> 01:50:36.215]  I mean, we're talking major, major billion dollar deals all the time with antibodies, with artificial nanotech antibodies.
[01:50:37.656 --> 01:50:39.536]  And they were just saying, no, it's a total scam.
[01:50:40.156 --> 01:50:45.518]  And it is just a franchise of a new frankenvirus they've made so that new versions can come out in the future.
[01:50:47.677 --> 01:50:48.917]  What this is, is a simulant.
[01:50:49.718 --> 01:50:53.719]  So this is just the introduction to it all, exactly what we'd already reverse engineered.
[01:50:54.279 --> 01:51:06.763]  Oh, they gave it to all these animals, and they had an incredible autoimmune response, and it boosted their immune system until they ran into the actual thing they were supposedly gonna be protected from, and then they died.
[01:51:08.504 --> 01:51:11.925]  Because the body just went, whoa, I don't know how to deal with this, and it was over.
[01:51:13.146 --> 01:51:15.107]  So, the most common virus is Corona.
[01:51:15.407 --> 01:51:15.987]  It's everywhere.
[01:51:16.027 --> 01:51:16.747]  It's on your hands.
[01:51:16.827 --> 01:51:17.467]  It's in the air.
[01:51:17.507 --> 01:51:18.568]  It comes out of your body.
[01:51:18.628 --> 01:51:19.188]  It's just everywhere.
[01:51:19.908 --> 01:51:33.212]  Now, we're going to be given a vaccine that is super strong to make us have an autoimmune response to something our body recognizes as part of it.
[01:51:34.616 --> 01:51:40.321]  Which is what the whole other area of gene and virus and cell theory is, is that no, viruses really just come out of us.
[01:51:40.601 --> 01:51:50.790]  Well, we know viruses go in and program cells to replicate themselves, but now they're learning that things that are basically viruses come out of ourselves as well, as a form of the cells getting waste out of them.
[01:51:51.730 --> 01:52:00.558]  So, they know how all this works now, and we're still following hundred-year-old germ theory, and the globalists have got us in just an absolutely terrible spot.
[01:52:00.958 --> 01:52:02.880]  I want to encourage listeners to realize that
[01:52:04.266 --> 01:52:05.547]  They want you dependent on them.
[01:52:05.647 --> 01:52:06.447]  They want you unhealthy.
[01:52:06.467 --> 01:52:07.168]  They want you dumbed down.
[01:52:07.208 --> 01:52:07.988]  They want you stupid.
[01:52:09.209 --> 01:52:13.491]  And one of the biggest things is if your immune system's not up, anything's going to attack you and hurt you.
[01:52:13.851 --> 01:52:14.932]  They don't want you to know about that.
[01:52:14.952 --> 01:52:17.974]  That's why Fauci didn't want to talk about vitamin D. He didn't want to talk about zinc.
[01:52:17.994 --> 01:52:22.396]  He didn't want to talk about any of that stuff, because these people want you at their own mercy.
[01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:30.001]  Well, I'm always promoting vitamins and minerals, and we have some of the highest quality ones out there, period, that are essential for your body's regular function.

[01:52:51.951 --> 01:52:53.712]  Can't even get the formula anymore because it's got 13 pills.
[01:52:54.813 --> 01:52:55.394]  We're good to go.
[01:53:17.503 --> 01:53:24.786]  At the end of April, with many new cases every day, he tweeted, quote, FREE AMERICA NOW, in all caps.
[01:53:25.987 --> 01:53:28.148]  On this issue, we do not agree.
[01:53:28.168 --> 01:53:33.890]  I mean, this is a hot button issue where rationality takes a back seat.
[01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:38.272]  So in the grand scheme of things, I think this is
[01:53:39.665 --> 01:53:44.326]  You know, what we have is something with a very low mortality rate and high contagion.
[01:53:45.146 --> 01:53:50.427]  And something that is of low risk to a young person is of high risk to an older person.
[01:53:51.107 --> 01:54:02.590]  Essentially, the right thing to do would be to not have done a lockdown for the whole country, but to have, I think, anyone who's at risk should be quarantined until the storm passes.
[01:54:03.345 --> 01:54:05.326]  All right, but this storm is coming again.
[01:54:05.346 --> 01:54:10.427]  You know, you're talking a lot about saving humanity, but these are humans that die in the process.
[01:54:10.768 --> 01:54:11.488]  Everybody dies.
[01:54:12.488 --> 01:54:13.308]  I know that, Elon.
[01:54:13.649 --> 01:54:14.149]  I get that.
[01:54:14.789 --> 01:54:17.430]  The question is, what on balance is the greater good?
[01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:19.871]  And you feel lockdowns did not do that?
[01:54:19.891 --> 01:54:20.231]  No.
[01:54:22.992 --> 01:54:24.692]  This is a no-win situation.
[01:54:25.313 --> 01:54:28.054]  It has diminished my faith in humanity, this whole thing.
[01:54:28.514 --> 01:54:28.954]  Because?
[01:54:30.995 --> 01:54:32.155]  The irrationality.
[01:54:34.276 --> 01:54:35.356]  Of people in general.
[01:54:36.017 --> 01:54:37.018]  Will you get a vaccine?
[01:54:37.818 --> 01:54:38.999]  What do you do with your own family?
[01:54:39.039 --> 01:54:39.940]  You won't get a vaccine.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:40.500]  Why is that?
[01:54:41.461 --> 01:54:45.244]  I'm not at risk for COVID, nor am I kidding.
[01:54:46.085 --> 01:54:47.866]  So you won't do that?
[01:54:47.946 --> 01:54:48.046]  No.
[01:54:48.106 --> 01:54:49.127]  And what do you do now?
[01:54:49.167 --> 01:54:50.688]  Do you just go to work?
[01:54:50.748 --> 01:54:53.150]  Is that how you're conducting yourself and your family?
[01:54:53.530 --> 01:54:53.710]  Yeah.
[01:54:54.804 --> 01:54:58.465]  This entire time SpaceX has been at work through this entire thing.
[01:54:59.086 --> 01:54:59.886]  We didn't skip a day.
[01:55:00.306 --> 01:55:04.047]  We had national security clearance because we're doing national security work.
[01:55:04.487 --> 01:55:06.308]  We sent astronauts to the space station and back.
[01:55:07.028 --> 01:55:14.231]  Tesla has been apart from several weeks where we're shut down by the state and then the overzealous Alameda County, which is a travesty.
[01:55:14.651 --> 01:55:19.933]  But apart from that, we've been making cars this entire time and it's been great.
[01:55:20.413 --> 01:55:21.835]  How do you answer your employees?
[01:55:21.855 --> 01:55:25.338]  You say, I think you're putting me and my family at risk.
[01:55:25.598 --> 01:55:26.780]  What do you say to them then?
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:27.580]  Great, stay home.
[01:55:28.381 --> 01:55:28.802]  Stay home.
[01:55:29.603 --> 01:55:29.943]  That's it?
[01:55:30.503 --> 01:55:30.724]  Yeah.
[01:55:31.545 --> 01:55:37.611]  Do they get penalized for that or just what's it's what can they do if they feel that they are at risk?
[01:55:38.572 --> 01:55:43.377]  I mean, if they have a legitimate reason to be at risk, then they, you know, they should stay home.
[01:55:43.837 --> 01:55:55.084]  All right, so when they decide, this is your policy, when these workers are worried, and do you feel that they have a, I want to just get back to that, put yourselves in their shoes, do you feel they have a good reason to be worried?
[01:55:55.805 --> 01:56:03.770]  And do you feel a duty to pay them and make sure they're okay, despite the fact that you don't agree with how they feel about COVID versus how you feel about COVID?
[01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:04.310]  Let's just move on.
[01:56:04.911 --> 01:56:05.431]  Just move on?
[01:56:05.951 --> 01:56:06.592]  That's what you want to do?
[01:56:09.538 --> 01:56:15.086]  Cara, I do not want to get into a debate about the current situation.
[01:56:15.566 --> 01:56:16.488]  Okay, all right, okay.
[01:56:16.588 --> 01:56:19.372]  I want to finish up talking about... You want to end the podcast?
[01:56:19.412 --> 01:56:19.893]  Now we can do it.
[01:56:20.365 --> 01:56:20.605]  Okay.
[01:56:20.645 --> 01:56:20.966]  What do you say?
[01:56:20.986 --> 01:56:21.346]  No, we don't.
[01:56:21.386 --> 01:56:21.946]  I don't want to end it.
[01:56:21.966 --> 01:56:23.548]  I just want to understand where you're at.
[01:56:23.588 --> 01:56:23.908]  But I do.
[01:56:23.928 --> 01:56:25.229]  I feel like I understand where you are.
[01:56:25.770 --> 01:56:32.996]  And I should say, we've also spent quite a lot of time with the Hobbit epidemiology team doing antibody studies.
[01:56:33.497 --> 01:56:37.100]  Tesla makes the vaccine machines for CureVac.
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:39.682]  Gates said something about me not knowing what I was doing.
[01:56:39.782 --> 01:56:45.047]  It's like, hey, knucklehead, we actually make the vaccine machines for CureVac, that company you're invested in.
[01:56:45.509 --> 01:56:54.237]  Seems like you have a lot of passion around this topic, like that you feel this has been blown and that there are better ways to do it, which is what you do in your other parts of your life, correct?
[01:56:54.638 --> 01:57:03.466]  Whether it's Tesla or SpaceX, the rockets aren't being reused, the cars aren't electric, the way we address viruses is irrational.
[01:57:04.387 --> 01:57:05.308]  It's very irrational.
[01:57:07.930 --> 01:57:08.711]  All right, we have Dr.
[01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:11.391]  Maude, back with us.
[01:57:11.431 --> 01:57:13.894]  I wanted to show you this International Business Times headline.
[01:57:14.375 --> 01:57:15.176]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:57:15.817 --> 01:57:20.883]  And it says, Coronavirus Update Vaccine Skips Important Animal Testing Phase Straight to Humans.
[01:57:21.523 --> 01:57:23.065]  Now, why is that going on?
[01:57:23.939 --> 01:57:29.181]  Well, because they've done mRNA testing with similar pathogens.
[01:57:29.721 --> 01:57:34.262]  And if you could just recap and start over, because your Skype cut out and you got cut off on your phone line next, doctor.
[01:57:34.842 --> 01:57:40.804]  If you could just start over where you were about the animal testing, looked like it was working great, and then what happened next?
[01:57:44.171 --> 01:57:54.215]  Similar studies on animals and in the initial trials, they looked like they had great immune responses, great antibody levels, T cell responses.
[01:57:54.635 --> 01:57:58.997]  Then they were challenged with that virus, which is unethical in human studies, but
[01:57:59.477 --> 01:58:00.698]  You could do that with the animals.
[01:58:01.339 --> 01:58:08.685]  And when they challenged the animals, they had a cytokine storm, meaning they actually had a worsened response.
[01:58:08.765 --> 01:58:11.708]  They actually got sicker and they even died.
[01:58:11.868 --> 01:58:14.571]  So they had lung inflammation, liver failure, etc.
[01:58:15.111 --> 01:58:21.477]  So perhaps that's why we are purposely skipping the animal trials in this particular vaccine for us.
[01:58:22.222 --> 01:58:23.504]  That's what I'm concerned about.
[01:58:23.564 --> 01:58:29.976]  Now explain the storm and how that ties into the 1918 Spanish flu for folks that don't know.
[01:58:29.996 --> 01:58:33.943]  It wasn't the flu replicating that killed him, it was the autoimmune response in the lungs.
[01:58:33.983 --> 01:58:34.483]  Correct, Doctor?
[01:58:35.959 --> 01:58:37.820]  Yes, that is correct.
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:40.201]  The body has an exaggerated immune response.
[01:58:40.221 --> 01:58:45.144]  It doesn't have a normal immune response and that's what we're afraid of happening with this exact vaccine.
[01:58:45.504 --> 01:58:50.346]  This is some of the things that have been brought up by the researchers themselves behind the vaccines.
[01:58:50.386 --> 01:58:53.548]  They say this is definitely something that can happen.
[01:58:53.888 --> 01:59:01.012]  So when you see the common cold, you see the common flu, you see something in that same family of coronaviruses,
[01:59:01.392 --> 01:59:12.620]  You could, instead of having a better immune response, you can have a worsened immune response and perhaps be one of those people in the intensive care unit who even dies or has other comorbidities from that.
[01:59:13.481 --> 01:59:14.481]  Why are we doing this?
[01:59:14.582 --> 01:59:16.763]  Why are we going to be in the experiment?
[01:59:16.843 --> 01:59:22.267]  Because this, not one experiment will be fully completed before October of 2021.
[01:59:22.407 --> 01:59:26.170]  We will all be inside of an experiment.
[01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:36.341]  And I thought that we were supposed to go with the Nuremberg Code from World War II where we should not be forced into any experiment without informed consent and our consent.
[01:59:36.921 --> 01:59:38.183]  So what is happening here?
[01:59:38.243 --> 01:59:42.627]  Why are they trying to tell us that we need to have this vaccine to go back to normal?
[01:59:42.667 --> 01:59:46.412]  This does not make sense to me and to me this goes against the Nuremberg Code.
[01:59:47.455 --> 01:59:52.736]  Well it doesn't just go against the Nuremberg Code that obviously comes out of Nazi Germany that was then picked up into the Geneva Convention.
[01:59:52.976 --> 01:59:56.938]  It goes against all common sense, common law, federal state laws around the world.
[01:59:57.238 --> 02:00:03.219]  And it's all coercion by a guy that isn't even a medical doctor that tells us he's going to hold us hostage until we do this.
[02:00:03.559 --> 02:00:10.881]  They have British ministers and Australian ministers saying you'll be locked up in your house basically if you don't let the military come give you this shot.
[02:00:11.161 --> 02:00:12.822]  And then they admit it's making 80% of people sick.
[02:00:15.143 --> 02:00:16.344]  20% are going to the hospital.
[02:00:16.624 --> 02:00:19.846]  That's the weaker vaccine, the mRNA vaccine.
[02:00:20.166 --> 02:00:27.471]  I know Gates is pushing one where 100% of people get sick and some die, and then they admit they skipped the animals because they don't want to have all these dead animals.
[02:00:27.551 --> 02:00:32.594]  I mean, this is a bold move, Doctor, because this is going to have major backlash.
[02:00:36.036 --> 02:00:37.577]  Yes, you're right.
[02:00:38.018 --> 02:00:42.260]  We need to know everything that's going on right now because, in my opinion,
[02:00:43.976 --> 02:00:45.237]  There is a plan behind this.
[02:00:45.637 --> 02:00:48.659]  I think that they're already talking about the second wave.
[02:00:48.719 --> 02:00:50.540]  I think they already are expecting this.
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:01:00.726]  The second wave could simply be the people that get the vaccines are now more at immune risk of getting very sick from any sort of coronavirus they come across.
[02:01:01.987 --> 02:01:04.768]  So then they'll blame it on the COVID-20, right?
[02:01:04.948 --> 02:01:05.869]  And then they'll say, look,
[02:01:06.570 --> 02:01:07.891]  You guys didn't behave yourselves.
[02:01:07.911 --> 02:01:09.352]  You should have been in lockdown longer.
[02:01:09.392 --> 02:01:10.653]  You should have worn your mask more.
[02:01:11.193 --> 02:01:16.876]  Perhaps we should take people out of your homes like the World Health Organization has been threatening us with.
[02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:19.158]  We could take your child or you from your home.
[02:01:19.178 --> 02:01:19.458]  That's right.
[02:01:19.478 --> 02:01:22.600]  They're making normal viruses normally being sick.
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:26.161]  And they're saying, you don't need vitamins, you don't need minerals, you need these vaccines.
[02:01:26.221 --> 02:01:30.183]  And by the way, if you don't do what we say and don't take constant tests, we're going to take your children away.
[02:01:30.203 --> 02:01:31.784]  It's actually starting in Australia.
[02:01:31.824 --> 02:01:32.844]  It's starting in Canada.
[02:01:33.345 --> 02:01:33.945]  And the U.N.
[02:01:34.005 --> 02:01:34.685]  is directing it.
[02:01:34.725 --> 02:01:35.205]  I mean, how?
[02:01:35.486 --> 02:01:37.626]  This is true dystopia, doctor.
[02:01:37.647 --> 02:01:40.328]  I agree with you.
[02:01:40.608 --> 02:01:43.569]  And in Spain, you know, they already have containment camps set up.
[02:01:43.609 --> 02:01:49.252]  And I believe they're saying all asymptomatic carriers will go into that containment camp.
[02:01:49.572 --> 02:01:51.893]  Healthy people, not the sick people.
[02:01:52.765 --> 02:01:55.166]  What are we doing in our world?
[02:01:55.566 --> 02:02:00.608]  We need to really pay attention to what's happening around the world because it's being mirrored in all the countries.
[02:02:01.008 --> 02:02:03.549]  So I have people tell me, well, that's not the United States.
[02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:05.069]  That's a wrong idea.
[02:02:05.089 --> 02:02:11.291]  It's a wrong thought process because we have to care what's going on because this is a world issue.
[02:02:11.371 --> 02:02:13.712]  It is not just one country or another country's issue.
[02:02:13.792 --> 02:02:14.072]  That's right.
[02:02:14.092 --> 02:02:16.553]  It's the UN and we've got to fight it globally and locally.
[02:02:16.573 --> 02:02:17.293]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:17.333 --> 02:02:18.134]  This lady's amazing.
[02:02:18.154 --> 02:02:19.254]  Dr. Carrie Madej.
[02:02:21.395 --> 02:02:22.095]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:02:23.302 --> 02:02:30.550]  We're sitting here covering the mRNA vaccine, the mRNA vaccine, all of it.
[02:02:30.851 --> 02:02:31.692]  It makes my head spin.
[02:02:32.433 --> 02:02:35.216]  And we're looking at this news that's breaking.
[02:02:35.977 --> 02:02:37.358]  This is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:02:37.799 --> 02:02:41.703]  Pelosi discusses continuity of government following Trump COVID diagnosis.
[02:02:42.742 --> 02:02:43.302]  I told you.
[02:02:43.583 --> 02:02:48.245]  I said they could say he had COVID, poison him, and then use COG to remove him.
[02:02:48.726 --> 02:02:50.707]  And now you notice I've been harping on COG.
[02:02:50.747 --> 02:02:51.707]  Like, what's COG?
[02:02:52.208 --> 02:02:53.388]  Now it's at NewsWorks.com.
[02:02:53.449 --> 02:02:55.069]  I'll play that clip next hour.
[02:02:55.090 --> 02:03:00.513]  I'm going to go ahead and host some of it in the next hour because this is an emergency situation under Nick Baggett until the last two segments.
[02:03:01.667 --> 02:03:08.033]  But we're joined by Dr. Carrie Maudet here, and I really appreciate her coming all this.
[02:03:08.053 --> 02:03:12.777]  She's a medical doctor, and she had Skype cut out, never happens, then her phone cut out.
[02:03:12.797 --> 02:03:13.418]  That was crazy.
[02:03:13.878 --> 02:03:17.302]  And with all the internet censorship and big tech even getting into private messages now,
[02:03:17.842 --> 02:03:26.767]  And censoring, I mean, who knows, they probably are doing that because they've been censoring doctors across the board, scientists, epidemiologists, prestigious, you know, former head of the Rockefeller Hospital.
[02:03:27.287 --> 02:03:34.811]  All these people, and they've been proven right about herd immunity, they've been proven right about the numbers of dead, of other things being added to COVID-19.
[02:03:35.151 --> 02:03:40.154]  Just in general, doctor, you're a smart lady, watching all this unfold.
[02:03:41.584 --> 02:03:42.646]  Where do you see it going?
[02:03:44.008 --> 02:03:51.920]  What do you see unfolding when Gates is on CBS and goes, yeah, 20% go to the hospital, some die, and 700 million are going to get sick?
[02:03:55.365 --> 02:03:57.567]  I mean, it just makes your head spin.
[02:03:57.787 --> 02:03:59.048]  They want in our bodies.
[02:03:59.108 --> 02:04:04.813]  And then we learn what they're doing is guinea pigging and changes our DNA and makes us this new creature.
[02:04:05.114 --> 02:04:06.415]  This is like an alien takeover.
[02:04:06.435 --> 02:04:13.681]  I mean, whether aliens are real on another planet, Bill Gates thinks he's a god who wants to have this genetic revolution over us.
[02:04:14.642 --> 02:04:17.344]  And again, folks, they want Trump out.
[02:04:17.384 --> 02:04:18.465]  They've already tried coups.
[02:04:19.617 --> 02:04:22.179]  Obviously, there's more threats to the president than any other president combined.
[02:04:22.519 --> 02:04:24.000]  Obviously, poison's the way they want to go.
[02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:29.664]  They're always saying he's 74, overweight, he's going to have a heart attack, he goes to a medical checkup, it's the end of the world.
[02:04:30.624 --> 02:04:33.306]  What they'll do is say he has COVID and poison him with something else.
[02:04:33.486 --> 02:04:37.649]  Or give him weaponized COVID, because it's a carrier platform, and do it.
[02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:40.250]  I mean, this is a big deal 31 days out.
[02:04:40.391 --> 02:04:41.811]  And I told you this was all coming.
[02:04:42.172 --> 02:04:45.314]  And already the COVID shutdown is annihilating the worldwide economy.
[02:04:46.311 --> 02:04:49.634]  I mean, stuff is serious when I lay this out.
[02:04:51.195 --> 02:04:52.195]  When I tell you all of this.
[02:04:53.256 --> 02:04:54.317]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[02:04:54.337 --> 02:05:03.884]  When I tell you the supply chain's breaking down, when I tell you our big food supply actually has the food, and all the other places are sold out, and they're trying to buy food months and months out, the price has already gone up 20-30%.
[02:05:04.445 --> 02:05:05.926]  I mean, this is really going on.
[02:05:06.686 --> 02:05:11.210]  And they're really coming in Australia, in Canada, in leftist areas of Europe, the U.S.
[02:05:11.230 --> 02:05:12.731]  saying we're going to forcibly inject you.
[02:05:14.264 --> 02:05:15.905]  And if you don't, you can't leave your house.
[02:05:15.945 --> 02:05:17.646]  And they're gonna make it a waiting list to get it.
[02:05:17.907 --> 02:05:19.528]  And there's a lot of people bought into the fear.
[02:05:19.548 --> 02:05:32.377]  And it's all weird fetishizing that, oh, you're heroes because you wear the mask, you're saving lives.
[02:05:32.797 --> 02:05:33.978]  And it's like, oh, just wear the mask.
[02:05:34.078 --> 02:05:35.259]  Oh, just take the inoculation.
[02:05:35.319 --> 02:05:36.539]  Oh, just have the tracker chip.
[02:05:36.639 --> 02:05:39.141]  Oh, just have the tracker app.
[02:05:39.241 --> 02:05:39.962]  Oh, just be a hero.
[02:05:41.561 --> 02:05:42.762]  And then everything that comes with it.
[02:05:43.022 --> 02:05:55.972]  And then they know, in mass Stockholm Syndrome, once they get people to do something that brain damages their kids and hurts them and sterilizes them, and as you get the medical problems that come with it, they've already argued and said, COVID-19's magical.
[02:05:56.352 --> 02:05:59.454]  It'll give you all these brain disorders and it'll sterilize you.
[02:05:59.875 --> 02:06:01.596]  But it's the vaccine that's doing it.
[02:06:01.916 --> 02:06:03.417]  We know who's behind it.
[02:06:03.477 --> 02:06:04.678]  We know what's in the literature.
[02:06:04.979 --> 02:06:06.140]  We know the background of it.
[02:06:07.130 --> 02:06:12.892]  And then Pelosi comes out two months ago and goes, he will be fumigated out of the White House one way or another, and we'll use the military to remove him.
[02:06:12.932 --> 02:06:20.295]  And I already met with COG, and they say I'm number two in command, even though it's the vice president.
[02:06:22.236 --> 02:06:24.157]  And then they start saying, oh, the military needs to remove him.
[02:06:24.177 --> 02:06:25.297]  The military says, we won't do that.
[02:06:25.577 --> 02:06:26.958]  They go, oh, Trump wants the military.
[02:06:27.838 --> 02:06:29.379]  Then they're going to hold up the election with the ballots.
[02:06:30.019 --> 02:06:32.820]  And then on January 20th, if Trump hasn't
[02:06:33.988 --> 02:06:38.131]  Well, in the election, clearly she will vote at the House of Representatives and install who she wants.
[02:06:38.972 --> 02:06:41.654]  And they've got it all fired up right now.
[02:06:42.114 --> 02:06:43.015]  No one gives you power.
[02:06:43.035 --> 02:06:44.056]  You have to take it from them.
[02:06:44.076 --> 02:06:45.757]  That's what Pelosi famously said.
[02:06:47.819 --> 02:06:48.460]  And who she worked for?
[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:50.201]  The chi-coms and the globalists.
[02:06:50.601 --> 02:06:54.404]  An empty nobody who hates this country put in power by the satanic cult.
[02:06:55.085 --> 02:06:55.745]  So here she is.
[02:06:56.846 --> 02:07:00.709]  Pelosi discusses continuity of government following Trump COVID diagnosis.
[02:07:00.929 --> 02:07:01.250]  Here it is.
[02:07:02.295 --> 02:07:05.598]  We'll talk about the Heroes Bill in a moment, but this is a very serious health threat.
[02:07:06.178 --> 02:07:08.220]  You are second in line for the presidency.
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:12.083]  Has the White House contacted you about the continuity of government?
[02:07:13.450 --> 02:07:24.576]  No, they haven't, but that is an ongoing, not with the White House, but with the military, quite frankly, in terms of some officials in the government.
[02:07:24.916 --> 02:07:28.058]  But let us just all pray for the President's health.
[02:07:28.118 --> 02:07:31.860]  Thank God the Vice President has tested positive.
[02:07:32.876 --> 02:07:36.018]  Negatively, and the second lady as well.
[02:07:36.639 --> 02:07:41.222]  So again, that continuity of government is always in place.
[02:07:42.783 --> 02:07:50.128]  I always say it's a relic of the past, but nonetheless, they say we have our job, we have to do, and this is what we'll do.
[02:07:50.288 --> 02:07:52.709]  Alright, let me decipher that for you.
[02:07:53.050 --> 02:07:58.533]  They tried to go to the system of COG that knows it's supposedly under lawful government and try to get an overthrow Trump.
[02:07:58.573 --> 02:07:59.094]  They've said that.
[02:08:00.144 --> 02:08:04.029]  The House Armed Services Committee Democrats wrote a letter two months ago and said, please overthrow Trump.
[02:08:04.329 --> 02:08:05.530]  And they said, hell no, this is illegal.
[02:08:05.550 --> 02:08:05.991]  You're crazy.
[02:08:07.332 --> 02:08:10.976]  So now they're like, oh, it's a relic of the past, but don't worry, the military's in charge.
[02:08:12.258 --> 02:08:16.543]  Well, really the military launched the four doomsday planes.
[02:08:18.595 --> 02:08:25.458]  To let the deep state know, even if they try to blow up federal buildings or assassinate people, that Trump has aircraft in the air.
[02:08:26.198 --> 02:08:31.680]  And that's what that is, is the military under Trump saying, no, we have aircraft in the air, you can't stop us.
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:34.221]  Because they know the Democrats are in league with the Chi-Coms and others.
[02:08:34.481 --> 02:08:40.003]  And America is at war with China and the deep staters and with Bill Gates and the whole nine yards right now.
[02:08:41.764 --> 02:08:44.365]  So she tried to say COGs are savior will remove Trump.
[02:08:44.605 --> 02:08:47.666]  Oh, now it's a relic of the past and you know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:08:48.882 --> 02:08:51.544]  But see, they could use the command-and-control system.
[02:08:51.824 --> 02:08:52.705]  Seen the movie Valkyrie?
[02:08:54.887 --> 02:08:56.248]  Tom Cruise's space military story?
[02:08:56.849 --> 02:09:06.016]  How Hitler had a martial law plan to keep control of the government, but they reversed Operation Valkyrie and tried to use that COG system against Hitler.
[02:09:06.837 --> 02:09:12.221]  Well, Pelosi's seeing Trump as Hitler, so they already tried this, it's not working, and now Valkyrie's in the air.
[02:09:14.483 --> 02:09:16.665]  That's why all four, they're never up at the same time.
[02:09:16.885 --> 02:09:17.886]  They're all up right now.
[02:09:22.090 --> 02:09:24.371]  Tomorrow's news today, folks, we're not playing games.
[02:09:27.333 --> 02:09:28.634]  All right, Dr. Maude is here.
[02:09:28.694 --> 02:09:31.656]  Dr. Carrie Maude, a lot of problems with her Skype and phone.
[02:09:31.856 --> 02:09:34.618]  I'm thinking it probably is on purpose with the massive censorship.
[02:09:34.838 --> 02:09:41.282]  What do you make of the censorship doctors around the world and prestigious scientists have gone through trying to suppress what you have to say?
[02:09:41.522 --> 02:09:42.722]  That's unprecedented as well.
[02:09:44.864 --> 02:09:48.586]  Well, I think we've always been censored, but now it's at an all-time high.
[02:09:49.296 --> 02:09:49.796]  I don't
[02:10:05.402 --> 02:10:12.646]  If you write the prescription for hydroxychloroquine, the pharmacist has the right to deny your prescription just because.
[02:10:12.746 --> 02:10:14.007]  They don't have to give a reason.
[02:10:14.467 --> 02:10:15.688]  And I heard a record skip there.
[02:10:15.728 --> 02:10:30.536]  That's on record that you have the medical degree, you have the license, it's something you're allowed to prescribe, it's known as safe, it's an off-market drug, it's cheap, it's good, it's moral, it pushes zinc into the cells, but now Big Pharma's the god, they can say no to the doctor.
[02:10:32.367 --> 02:10:33.368]  Exactly.
[02:10:33.388 --> 02:10:36.690]  They're also breaking their own federal laws.
[02:10:36.751 --> 02:10:38.332]  Privacy laws that are being broken.
[02:10:38.392 --> 02:10:42.015]  But they're doing this all under the guise of the Emergency Preparedness Act.
[02:10:42.155 --> 02:10:44.176]  Well, what is actually happening?
[02:10:44.216 --> 02:10:48.259]  Because if you look at the data, this does not be an emergency act right now.
[02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:50.882]  It does not support an emergency act.
[02:10:50.962 --> 02:10:51.322]  Exactly.
[02:10:51.402 --> 02:10:53.544]  It's doctors talking about the data they censor.
[02:10:53.584 --> 02:10:55.185]  Get into the real data about COVID.
[02:10:55.245 --> 02:10:57.567]  What is COVID from your research and what are the real numbers?
[02:10:59.403 --> 02:11:01.304]  Well, I mean, what are the numbers?
[02:11:01.484 --> 02:11:05.387]  They're actually very much manipulated and falsified.
[02:11:05.427 --> 02:11:15.454]  I mean, for instance, just the state of Florida, they found over 300 individual labs saying they had 100% of the cases positive when they were investigated less than 10%.
[02:11:16.575 --> 02:11:20.858]  Don't tell me that was just a mistake because over 300 is not a mistake.
[02:11:21.383 --> 02:11:24.546]  This has been replicated in other states as well.
[02:11:24.606 --> 02:11:37.897]  We're seeing that along with other things of just giving incentives to the hospitals and the doctors for having different diagnoses, putting COVID on the death certificate, they get more money, or from a discharge, get more money.
[02:11:38.137 --> 02:11:41.360]  I mean, come on, these are inflated numbers.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:47.485]  So if you look at what's really happening, it's about on par with maybe the H1N1 flu season.
[02:11:47.545 --> 02:11:49.507]  We didn't declare a pandemic over that.
[02:11:50.236 --> 02:11:54.417]  So no, we're not going by sound science and data.
[02:11:54.437 --> 02:11:56.218]  So what is going on here?
[02:11:56.238 --> 02:12:01.740]  And I believe it's really a bigger plan of having control over everybody.
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:04.501]  It's a world plan, not just one country.
[02:12:05.410 --> 02:12:08.732]  And a little story, I have to go to a doctor.
[02:12:08.812 --> 02:12:09.592]  Doctors, stay there.
[02:12:09.612 --> 02:12:14.374]  We're going to come right back to Dr. Carrie Madej on the other side, at Dr. M-A-D-E-J.
[02:12:14.394 --> 02:12:16.875]  She's amazing, and it's great having her.
[02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:20.337]  I appreciate her staying late because she's had some Skype problems, or we have, or whatever the hell's going on.
[02:12:20.777 --> 02:12:21.778]  Hour number four is coming up.
[02:12:21.798 --> 02:12:22.838]  She'll leave us in about 15 minutes.
[02:12:22.898 --> 02:12:26.520]  I'm going to blitz huge news, and then Dr. Nick Begich, stay with us.
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:30.002]  Global governments had lost control.
[02:12:30.822 --> 02:12:32.643]  Nationalists and populists were getting elected.
[02:12:33.677 --> 02:12:40.803]  The UN Director of the Vaccine Program said in December of last year, the front lines wobbly, doctors say vaccines are hurting people, not helping them.
[02:12:41.964 --> 02:12:45.647]  Sort of coming out that most of the polio on the planet was being caused by the polio vaccine.
[02:12:45.667 --> 02:12:48.529]  What were they going to do?
[02:12:49.150 --> 02:12:50.531]  Fail forward, too big to fail.
[02:12:50.971 --> 02:12:53.993]  Bring in the biggest global scare ever and watch the sheep line up.
[02:12:54.574 --> 02:12:56.936]  Bring in a global taxation system, a tracking system.
[02:12:58.191 --> 02:13:01.454]  Social credit score, total surveillance, enforced inoculations.
[02:13:01.994 --> 02:13:04.036]  Dr. Carrie Madej is here with us.
[02:13:04.056 --> 02:13:05.237]  She's a medical doctor.
[02:13:05.257 --> 02:13:08.019]  This is a short segment, long segment that she's going to leave us.
[02:13:08.199 --> 02:13:09.540]  You were getting into the big picture.
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:10.521]  Other facets of this.
[02:13:10.561 --> 02:13:11.221]  Please continue.
[02:13:11.762 --> 02:13:12.042]  Yeah.
[02:13:13.543 --> 02:13:14.264]  Yes, Alex.
[02:13:14.424 --> 02:13:19.588]  I just wanted to let your listeners know that my opinion is not coming just from research.
[02:13:19.688 --> 02:13:24.312]  I've actually attended meetings where control of people was discussed.
[02:13:24.412 --> 02:13:26.714]  And the one meeting I'd like to bring up briefly is
[02:13:27.225 --> 02:13:28.967]  A business owner's meeting in Atlanta.
[02:13:29.547 --> 02:13:37.955]  And this meeting was talking about how to get more companies internationally to come to Atlanta, but they had problems with the behavior of the people in Atlanta.
[02:13:38.455 --> 02:13:41.818]  That they were too racist, that they weren't amenable to different cultures.
[02:13:42.139 --> 02:13:43.480]  This is exactly what they said.
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:45.041]  So they had a plan.
[02:13:45.562 --> 02:13:47.243]  This is like about five years ago.
[02:13:47.363 --> 02:13:52.408]  They said they would introduce a health app, which is already downloaded on all our phones now.
[02:13:52.884 --> 02:13:59.567]  And in this health app, this would connect the person immediately to the cloud and give biometric data.
[02:13:59.667 --> 02:14:12.252]  So, an example is, if somebody lied, they would know, the phone would know they're lying immediately because of the GPS, of course, but also their voice inflection would know that they're lying.
[02:14:12.532 --> 02:14:16.694]  There's an electrodermal analysis that would be on par with the police station.
[02:14:16.734 --> 02:14:17.774]  That would know they're lying.
[02:14:18.194 --> 02:14:21.856]  If they're drinking alcohol, the alcohol content would be immediately known.
[02:14:22.577 --> 02:14:22.937]  We're good.
[02:14:45.089 --> 02:14:56.194]  somebody's behavior by saying you're lying and then have repercussions for lying, you could instantly change the behavior of a population in an area within 30 days.
[02:14:56.214 --> 02:14:58.015]  So think about that.
[02:14:58.075 --> 02:15:02.558]  And that technology is what we're talking about right now with the 06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06-06
[02:15:10.336 --> 02:15:15.521]  They called the first internet, when they declassified it in 1962, the Intergalactic Communications Network.
[02:15:15.842 --> 02:15:26.312]  And a psychiatrist at DARPA, I'm sure you know this, came up with the idea to have terminal computers that are wireless with little handheld computers that monitor our physiology, our behavior.
[02:15:26.392 --> 02:15:29.956]  They surmised they would have instruments strong enough and miniaturize the future.
[02:15:31.274 --> 02:15:32.695]  I wonder where they got all these ideas.
[02:15:33.615 --> 02:15:46.684]  And that they would then be able to track everything we do in live time and study the stimuli they put out through the TVs, through the broadcast, with the handheld devices to track our behavior so they could tune us under the control of the system.
[02:15:46.904 --> 02:15:48.284]  And it sounds like that's what you just said.
[02:15:49.845 --> 02:15:51.186]  Yes, this is a real plan.
[02:15:51.226 --> 02:15:54.368]  This is a real business owner's meeting.
[02:15:54.668 --> 02:15:56.990]  This is my alarm call to the world.
[02:15:57.290 --> 02:16:00.232]  They want to implement this in Atlanta, which is one of the pilot cities.
[02:16:02.179 --> 02:16:13.204]  Well, and that's why they've got alerts on our phones now, and alerts on our TVs, and alerts that are more and more and more, and messages and messages, and all the big tech watches your text messages, they're even censoring text messages now.
[02:16:13.485 --> 02:16:15.426]  They admit, I mean, this is all happening, isn't it?
[02:16:17.447 --> 02:16:22.209]  It's very true, and there's so much more technology than, you know, what we can go over on this segment.
[02:16:22.868 --> 02:16:23.009]  Yes.
[02:16:37.003 --> 02:16:46.889]  And I know the CIA and other globalist ARPA groups, through business groups, through executive groups, introduce what they're planning to roll out later, so people feel like they're part of the inside.
[02:16:46.909 --> 02:16:48.430]  Just like we have all these off-camera videos.
[02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:06.885]  Hot mics of Democrats going, we just wear the mask for theater to scare them.
[02:17:07.125 --> 02:17:08.087]  Come on, wear the mask.
[02:17:08.747 --> 02:17:10.750]  And so a lot of folks are in on this, too.
[02:17:10.810 --> 02:17:11.391]  It's incredible.
[02:17:11.431 --> 02:17:12.653]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[02:17:13.033 --> 02:17:15.376]  I want you, doctor, to recap what you just said.
[02:17:15.416 --> 02:17:16.378]  That is amazing.
[02:17:18.618 --> 02:17:22.241]  All right, you know, what Dr. Carrie Monday said is absolutely on target.
[02:17:22.542 --> 02:17:23.983]  This is all social engineering.
[02:17:24.163 --> 02:17:31.310]  They admit that's what the cell phones are, is social controls that track us and control us, that are watching, listening to us in live time, the home assistants.
[02:17:31.950 --> 02:17:37.755]  Facebook has a plan where in the future they'll own big buildings along with Amazon that are like 200 square foot for each person.
[02:17:38.176 --> 02:17:39.897]  Even families are in communal areas.
[02:17:40.718 --> 02:17:40.978]  I think so.
[02:18:01.445 --> 02:18:04.467]  You get to have a life, at least for a little while.
[02:18:04.727 --> 02:18:07.249]  They have so many robots, so many factories, so many computers.
[02:18:07.569 --> 02:18:10.010]  They can produce all the food, produce everything now.
[02:18:10.090 --> 02:18:11.131]  They don't need you anymore.
[02:18:11.571 --> 02:18:13.933]  But to get you to go along with it, they get you to acquiesce.
[02:18:14.333 --> 02:18:15.634]  And once you give into it, it's over.
[02:18:15.794 --> 02:18:22.878]  So, Doctor, recap what you said on your Skype spec about Atlanta five years ago, how you got brought into this, how it blew you away.
[02:18:22.958 --> 02:18:24.699]  I know the stuff you're talking about is very, very real.
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:26.400]  What they described as a
[02:18:27.461 --> 02:18:27.621]  Yeah.
[02:18:45.487 --> 02:18:47.329]  We have this window to say no now.
[02:18:47.870 --> 02:18:48.711]  This is the window.
[02:18:49.352 --> 02:18:51.094]  It's not, oh, just wear a mask for 15 days.
[02:18:51.374 --> 02:18:52.135]  Oh, just stay inside.
[02:18:52.235 --> 02:18:52.395]  No.
[02:18:52.616 --> 02:18:53.377]  I told you it would never end.
[02:18:53.637 --> 02:18:55.219]  Now CNN says it never goes back.
[02:18:55.419 --> 02:18:56.280]  You never stop masks.
[02:18:56.380 --> 02:18:57.241]  And there's going to be shots.
[02:18:57.622 --> 02:19:00.525]  And we'll decide on your app when you can go out and when you can drive.
[02:19:01.426 --> 02:19:04.270]  The mega, the megaopolis videos 10 years ago.
[02:19:05.677 --> 02:19:12.440]  For Children's TV in the UK said, you'll be told by your phone when you can go out, when you can have meat, when you can have a job, when you can marry.
[02:19:13.140 --> 02:19:14.261]  You get meat once a year.
[02:19:14.421 --> 02:19:16.542]  This is a total societal takeover plan.
[02:19:16.802 --> 02:19:21.844]  And once they get you Pavlovianly to follow orders on something simple like a mask, everything else follows.
[02:19:21.884 --> 02:19:29.487]  So Dr. Carey Maude, the time we've got here with you, recap what happened in Atlanta and then talk about that window of opportunity you just discussed.
[02:19:31.363 --> 02:19:38.790]  Yes, just going back over, I'm not speaking just from a scientific background and researching.
[02:19:38.890 --> 02:19:51.983]  I also attended business meetings where the plan to control people was discussed, and it was a real plan with a timeline, and there were people in the big tech world, people that you might see on CNN,
[02:19:53.086 --> 02:20:01.249]  We're in small business owners, and we're serious about trying to modify and augment a group of individuals' behavior.
[02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:07.712]  So within a city, within a county, within a state, and perhaps, you know, bigger areas than that.
[02:20:08.152 --> 02:20:12.374]  So they want to control what you say, what you think.
[02:20:13.137 --> 02:20:19.910]  How you behave, and you'd have repercussions, and this would be done through the smartphone, through the health app that you have.
[02:20:20.391 --> 02:20:24.980]  If you look on your health app, you'll find dropdowns if you really look at subcategories.
[02:20:25.518 --> 02:20:32.604]  Well, it tells you how many times you've had sex, how many drugs you keep, the medicines in your body, the illicit drugs in your body.
[02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:35.026]  Everything about you is known.
[02:20:35.046 --> 02:20:36.467]  Your emotions are known.
[02:20:36.827 --> 02:20:43.472]  So everything that you're doing would be transmitted to your cell phone, which would go into the cloud and some AI connection.
[02:20:43.913 --> 02:20:51.919]  And then if it wasn't the kind of behavior deemed worthy or good for society, for the good of the whole, there would be repercussions.
[02:20:52.472 --> 02:20:54.573]  Yeah, and I see her do interviews all the time.
[02:20:54.653 --> 02:20:55.753]  Her Skype's being cut off.
[02:20:55.833 --> 02:20:56.793]  Her phone's being cut off.
[02:20:56.833 --> 02:20:57.934]  She's not doing this on purpose.
[02:20:57.954 --> 02:20:59.114]  This is the next level of it.
[02:20:59.834 --> 02:21:01.074]  And that's what the Chinese Communist said.
[02:21:01.094 --> 02:21:06.836]  They said, we're in your phones and we will not let you take two steps outside your house if you don't submit to us.
[02:21:07.756 --> 02:21:10.657]  And they're now celebrating President Trump being sick.
[02:21:11.197 --> 02:21:12.718]  They're now celebrating all of this.
[02:21:12.798 --> 02:21:13.418]  It's nightmarish.
[02:21:13.438 --> 02:21:15.579]  I want to show you a photo here for TV viewers.
[02:21:15.899 --> 02:21:17.259]  Look at the true face of evil.
[02:21:17.279 --> 02:21:20.140]  Let's pull up the digital photo on InfoWars.com if we can.
[02:21:21.542 --> 02:21:26.062]  Michael Morse's evil genius Trump could be lying about having COVID to postpone the election.
[02:21:27.571 --> 02:21:28.672]  Trump's going to win the election.
[02:21:28.692 --> 02:21:33.396]  It's Democrats that want to postpone it with mail-in ballots saying months and months and then it'll never be decided.
[02:21:33.716 --> 02:21:37.299]  So see, if you have any intelligence, you know Democrats do the mail-in ballots.
[02:21:37.799 --> 02:21:38.580]  They want to lock down.
[02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:40.101]  They say they're going to contest no matter what.
[02:21:40.121 --> 02:21:40.982]  They know they're losing.
[02:21:41.202 --> 02:21:42.203]  They want 20th Amendment.
[02:21:42.243 --> 02:21:42.883]  That's their plan.
[02:21:43.243 --> 02:21:44.825]  He comes out and says Trump's fake.
[02:21:45.085 --> 02:21:45.886]  He's not sick.
[02:21:46.166 --> 02:21:47.527]  He wants to hold off the election.
[02:21:47.847 --> 02:21:49.428]  When that's their, just look at that man.
[02:21:49.468 --> 02:21:51.390]  Would you let him babysit your children?
[02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:54.592]  How about he and Brian Stelter pull up to your house as contact tracers?
[02:21:55.573 --> 02:21:57.376]  Oh, sorry, you didn't submit to the inoculations.
[02:21:57.396 --> 02:21:58.318]  We're taking your children.
[02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:06.492]  You know your children are gonna have a good, good time with Uncle Stelter and Uncle Moore.
[02:22:08.871 --> 02:22:11.132]  Doctor, continuing here, what was it like for you?
[02:22:11.152 --> 02:22:16.114]  Because I know the CIA, you're saying this is like through CNN, they really are like the deep, deep part of that.
[02:22:16.134 --> 02:22:19.656]  I know people that have actually been in similar meetings, lawyers, politicians, others.
[02:22:20.296 --> 02:22:24.518]  I actually ran into a high-level guy today that went ahead and told me a bunch of stuff because he's so freaked out.
[02:22:25.338 --> 02:22:28.360]  And I guess you're a good-looking woman, you're a medical doctor, you're a smart person.
[02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:32.301]  Did you get invited to this to see if you'd buy into it, to see if you'd be a change agent?
[02:22:32.541 --> 02:22:33.682]  For them, why'd they invite you to this?
[02:22:35.268 --> 02:22:41.493]  No, I'm surprised that I was, and the person that really tried to get me to come, I finally went.
[02:22:41.713 --> 02:22:44.055]  I said, why would you ever invite me to that kind of a meeting?
[02:22:44.855 --> 02:22:46.736]  And they said, well, you'll soon see.
[02:22:47.097 --> 02:22:48.278]  It's either us or them.
[02:22:48.778 --> 02:22:50.079]  What side do you want to be on?
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:53.241]  And I said, well, I'll never be like you.
[02:22:53.321 --> 02:22:54.602]  I will never think like that.
[02:22:54.682 --> 02:22:57.644]  And I will never think that way of other people of humanity.
[02:22:57.945 --> 02:23:02.328]  And I said, do you really think that you will be exempt from this technology because you won't?
[02:23:03.047 --> 02:23:04.727]  I said, you are foolish to believe.
[02:23:05.247 --> 02:23:09.808]  And as they discussed this plan, people were clapping and standing ovation.
[02:23:10.409 --> 02:23:14.649]  And I definitely was the black sheep there because I was in shock.
[02:23:14.949 --> 02:23:18.290]  I could not believe what they were suggesting and what the plan was.
[02:23:18.350 --> 02:23:22.171]  So my point to you is, we have a window of opportunity here.
[02:23:22.711 --> 02:23:24.932]  And we have the power, the people have the power.
[02:23:24.972 --> 02:23:26.372]  We always have had the power.
[02:23:26.432 --> 02:23:28.732]  We are amazing, brilliant, cherished beings.
[02:23:29.352 --> 02:23:31.953]  All we have to do is say no and stand up for ourselves.
[02:23:32.503 --> 02:23:34.024]  Be united, not divided.
[02:23:34.545 --> 02:23:40.110]  And if we just say no to this tyranny, to this insanity, we can change our world for the better.
[02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:42.051]  We have the ability to have free energy.
[02:23:42.091 --> 02:23:43.813]  We have the ability for clean energy.
[02:23:44.133 --> 02:23:46.415]  We have cures for just about anything you can think of.
[02:23:46.855 --> 02:23:47.396]  We have it.
[02:23:47.936 --> 02:23:51.579]  So let's stand together and be united and stop this.
[02:23:51.659 --> 02:23:53.321]  And stop the masks, stop the
[02:23:55.868 --> 02:23:59.591]  You know, not taking these experimental drugs and vaccines.
[02:24:00.071 --> 02:24:00.952]  Enough is enough.
[02:24:01.452 --> 02:24:03.253]  And this is my alarm bell to the world.
[02:24:03.274 --> 02:24:04.935]  Well, doctor, did they make you sign a nondisclosure?
[02:24:04.955 --> 02:24:07.797]  Because a nondisclosure doesn't cover criminal activity anyways.
[02:24:08.338 --> 02:24:10.539]  I mean, you should come back.
[02:24:10.599 --> 02:24:12.321]  We ought to fly you here to Austin.
[02:24:13.181 --> 02:24:14.522]  No, they did not make me sign it.
[02:24:14.582 --> 02:24:18.686]  What they did is jammed our phone and we weren't allowed to leave the building and we were bussed in.
[02:24:19.166 --> 02:24:20.227]  But I did not sign anything.
[02:24:22.319 --> 02:24:23.740]  Well, no, that's how this actually works.
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:24.901]  You know, this happened to my dad.
[02:24:26.262 --> 02:24:32.007]  The plan wasn't as far along then, but he was top of his class when he was about 15, and he was already at 16.
[02:24:32.267 --> 02:24:42.456]  At 15, he worked at MD Anderson and some stuff, and then as an assistant, and then he got advanced to Plan 2, University of Texas, and they brought him in on it to see it.
[02:24:42.756 --> 02:24:48.641]  Only five other students in Texas at the time, at that age, were brought into that plan at UT, and it was pretty much the same thing.
[02:24:49.541 --> 02:25:13.962]  You know, they had nuclear reactors nobody knew about, they had CD-ROMs back in the mid-60s, and they were basically telling my dad this, and he decided not to be part of it, but they've recruited a lot of people to the technocracy to be the little minion overlords, and the idea is you get all this power of the breakaway civilization that's 10, 20 years ahead of us, 30 years, but the low-level folks get, you know, five years ahead, like they were doing for you, and I mean, this is evil.
[02:25:14.022 --> 02:25:15.143]  Is this not diabolical?
[02:25:16.818 --> 02:25:20.520]  It is evil, and to me, we're not just battling on the physical realm.
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:21.861]  It's a spiritual battle, too.
[02:25:22.001 --> 02:25:24.382]  It's a battle for our minds, bodies, and souls.
[02:25:25.063 --> 02:25:31.406]  That is my belief, you know, after studying this and researching this and going to meetings.
[02:25:31.546 --> 02:25:34.068]  I mean, we are in a war.
[02:25:34.128 --> 02:25:36.429]  We are in a battle, and we need to stand up for ourselves.
[02:25:36.489 --> 02:25:37.850]  It doesn't have to be that hard.
[02:25:37.870 --> 02:25:38.871]  We wouldn't have to have that.
[02:25:38.891 --> 02:25:39.311]  It wouldn't be
[02:25:39.935 --> 02:25:41.997]  Really so much force or violence.
[02:25:42.437 --> 02:25:45.880]  If we just said no and stop, they need us to consent.
[02:25:46.341 --> 02:25:48.603]  So do not consent to this insanity.
[02:25:49.043 --> 02:25:54.288]  You know, let's stand up for ourselves and finally make this earth the paradise it was always supposed to be.
[02:25:56.701 --> 02:26:03.948]  Well listen, I want to fly you to Austin, Texas to be on all our shows and work with us for a week or so if you've got the time, Doctor, during all this craziness.
[02:26:03.968 --> 02:26:04.948]  So come next week if you want.
[02:26:04.988 --> 02:26:05.729]  Come the week after that.
[02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:07.291]  I want to have you in the studio.
[02:26:07.371 --> 02:26:11.154]  I want to really hear what you have to say because I know when something's real, I know when it's not.
[02:26:11.174 --> 02:26:14.977]  And I know what you were invited into because I know a lot of people that have been.
[02:26:15.318 --> 02:26:16.579]  They use media organizations.
[02:26:16.599 --> 02:26:18.060]  They use law enforcement organizations.
[02:26:18.421 --> 02:26:19.461]  They use fraternal groups.
[02:26:21.423 --> 02:26:25.226]  And they are recruiting people into this technocracy that we now see emerging.
[02:26:25.246 --> 02:26:26.346]  That's what big tech is.
[02:26:26.747 --> 02:26:30.289]  I had a pretty high-level Google person meet with me about a year ago here in Austin.
[02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:32.170]  He told me basically the same story.
[02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:36.553]  He was recruited out of college into a similar deal, and they can get into your private messages, everything.
[02:26:36.593 --> 02:26:38.054]  It's just a big power trip for them.
[02:26:38.434 --> 02:26:42.537]  So, Dr. Carey, we really appreciate Dr. Carey Madej for joining us.
[02:26:42.557 --> 02:26:45.078]  You can find her at serendipitygroup.org.
[02:26:45.419 --> 02:26:46.499]  Serendipitygroup.org.
[02:26:46.519 --> 02:26:47.600]  I'll come back with a final segment.
[02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:48.561]  Head of Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:26:48.581 --> 02:26:48.921]  Stay with us.
[02:26:50.353 --> 02:26:57.439]  Look, humans are attaining secrets of the universe and we're attaining a lot of godlike power, but we're not God.
[02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:05.806]  And you've got a lot of really sick people that have set up national security apparatuses around the world to keep the public from having that knowledge.
[02:27:07.608 --> 02:27:17.777]  And the first thing they do is add fluoride and GMO and electromagnetic radiation and now genetic engineering viruses into our cells
[02:27:19.209 --> 02:27:21.590]  To guinea pig us and reprogram us.
[02:27:21.630 --> 02:27:29.895]  So, when I say that Michael Moore looks like a nightmare pedophile to me, I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[02:27:29.935 --> 02:27:31.976]  His spirit, though, is a monstrous creature.
[02:27:33.057 --> 02:27:37.880]  Not because he's obese, but because he's obviously a very wicked person.
[02:27:39.201 --> 02:27:39.921]  It shines through.
[02:27:41.202 --> 02:27:42.763]  But he wants forced inoculation.
[02:27:44.175 --> 02:27:49.180]  So he wants to rape you with a genetic material from a big company that has liability protection.
[02:27:51.042 --> 02:27:57.868]  I mean, if you were a child hypothetically raped by him, you know, he might not be able to give you one of his diseases, though I'm sure he'd want to if he was that type of creature.
[02:27:58.509 --> 02:28:05.396]  But with these vaccines that are nanotech that reprogram you, it's the ultimate rape of your genetic code!
[02:28:07.517 --> 02:28:17.683]  And if someone's trying to rape you with a needle that's got liability protection, who just so happens to have the hobby of wanting to depopulate the earth, you have a right and you have a duty to defend yourself.
[02:28:18.103 --> 02:28:19.324]  So never forget that.
[02:28:20.484 --> 02:28:22.246]  And remember, we've gone off the edge of the cliff here.
[02:28:22.886 --> 02:28:24.607]  Compliance isn't gonna get you ahead now.
[02:28:27.669 --> 02:28:34.793]  This is a nightmare system of the Hollywood scum and the big tech scum and the Rockefeller and the Rothschild and all the old money.
[02:28:36.305 --> 02:28:44.890]  That are slaves of the dark side, and their God wants to kill people, and they're scared, and they're slaves, and they're carrying out.
[02:28:45.271 --> 02:28:46.511]  You're like, why would they want to do this?
[02:28:46.591 --> 02:28:47.432]  Why are they so evil?
[02:28:47.492 --> 02:28:48.853]  Because they're turned over!
[02:28:48.873 --> 02:28:52.375]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[02:28:53.376 --> 02:29:00.220]  Plans for continuing government in place after Trump coronavirus diagnosis, Pelosi, in case he dies.
[02:29:02.312 --> 02:29:04.373]  And everybody's like, oh, you thought it was a hoax.
[02:29:04.973 --> 02:29:05.754]  Trump got it.
[02:29:06.234 --> 02:29:09.056]  And even medical doctors are like, most of the tests are false positive.
[02:29:09.076 --> 02:29:10.076]  Let's check that.
[02:29:10.316 --> 02:29:12.237]  But the death thing is low.
[02:29:13.018 --> 02:29:14.099]  They're testing everybody.
[02:29:14.179 --> 02:29:16.940]  I mean, Trump just signed $75 million for more testing.
[02:29:18.581 --> 02:29:26.826]  And the budget is $7-plus billion to test every American over and over and over again to have a job.
[02:29:26.866 --> 02:29:28.066]  They got the wristbands ready.
[02:29:28.346 --> 02:29:29.507]  Singapore already rolled them out.
[02:29:29.647 --> 02:29:30.628]  Australia already rolled them out.
[02:29:31.528 --> 02:29:32.489]  Spain already rolled it out.
[02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:35.871]  Quebec City already rolled it out.
[02:29:35.991 --> 02:29:37.251]  Ohio's trying to roll it out.
[02:29:38.012 --> 02:29:39.773]  And they're on the news saying, we're gonna come take your kids.
[02:29:39.793 --> 02:29:44.696]  They've got contact tracers that come and demand blood in Houston and Atlanta and L.A.
[02:29:44.916 --> 02:29:51.700]  I mean, they're just building their army of weird little political medical officers that come to your house!
[02:29:53.921 --> 02:29:55.042]  And Hitler always said it.
[02:29:56.182 --> 02:30:00.465]  First you get the women on your side, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:12.130]  And man, I run into these women particularly, and I'm wearing my mask, and I go, well, you know that that type of mask doesn't even protect people on the outside.
[02:30:12.190 --> 02:30:12.791]  That's an M95.
[02:30:12.931 --> 02:30:13.892]  It only protects you.
[02:30:14.272 --> 02:30:14.652]  Oh, really?
[02:30:14.672 --> 02:30:15.313]  That's not true.
[02:30:15.573 --> 02:30:16.514]  They don't care.
[02:30:17.055 --> 02:30:23.121]  They want to feel good, because to them, watching a movie or a video game is as real as walking through the forest.
[02:30:23.971 --> 02:30:28.253]  Having a baby that's online that's imaginary is the same as having a baby.
[02:30:28.533 --> 02:30:33.835]  People have had it so soft, so long, and are such followers, and are so programmed, and are so stupid.
[02:30:34.675 --> 02:30:35.395]  It's men too.
[02:30:37.496 --> 02:30:39.537]  All we have to do is divide ourselves from them now.
[02:30:40.057 --> 02:30:47.360]  Lovingly talk to them, lovingly give them advice, but then don't be their friends, don't work with them, because they're going to come and make you take shots.
[02:30:47.580 --> 02:30:48.560]  They're going to take your kids.
[02:30:48.580 --> 02:30:50.781]  They're going to make you submit to them.
[02:30:53.533 --> 02:30:56.073]  So you better stop submitting to them.
[02:30:57.294 --> 02:31:00.494]  Yeah, let's play the Pennsylvania State Rep with Governor Wolf.
[02:31:00.994 --> 02:31:02.935]  She's like, no, no, go ahead and wear your mask up on stage.
[02:31:03.075 --> 02:31:04.315]  It's political theater.
[02:31:05.995 --> 02:31:06.835]  It creates fear.
[02:31:06.875 --> 02:31:08.676]  It's how they're the good guys.
[02:31:09.056 --> 02:31:11.356]  And Trump should be running ads about this instead.
[02:31:13.236 --> 02:31:14.076]  He's a by-the-book guy.
[02:31:14.116 --> 02:31:15.077]  Oh, a medical doctor comes in.
[02:31:15.137 --> 02:31:16.657]  Oh, you're going to check us for COVID?
[02:31:16.697 --> 02:31:17.617]  All right, the weekly test.
[02:31:18.017 --> 02:31:19.097]  Oh, we came up positive.
[02:31:19.977 --> 02:31:22.738]  Nine times out of 10 with that test, it's false positive.
[02:31:24.138 --> 02:31:25.699]  But oh, now he might have the snivels.
[02:31:25.799 --> 02:31:34.846]  Oh, then he'll be a hero and he'll beat it in two weeks and be up there with Biden and... They've decided to go along with the COVID narrative to take control of it.
[02:31:36.207 --> 02:31:37.167]  I think Trump's staging it?
[02:31:37.228 --> 02:31:37.448]  No.
[02:31:39.049 --> 02:31:40.250]  He can't even trust people around him.
[02:31:40.270 --> 02:31:41.030]  He isn't that type of guy.
[02:31:41.351 --> 02:31:42.531]  They'd leak that instantly.
[02:31:43.192 --> 02:31:45.393]  No, they've, they've... Who knows what they sprayed on him?
[02:31:45.434 --> 02:31:45.974]  Who knows?
[02:31:46.014 --> 02:31:47.195]  He's been out, exhausted.
[02:31:47.215 --> 02:31:48.196]  He's 74 years old.
[02:31:48.936 --> 02:31:49.837]  It's psychosomatic.
[02:31:50.797 --> 02:31:51.298]  It's, it's a...
[02:31:54.116 --> 02:31:55.937]  Emotional response in a lot of cases.
[02:31:56.317 --> 02:31:58.097]  They call it a sympathetic response.
[02:31:58.697 --> 02:31:59.338]  I'll explain it again.
[02:32:00.098 --> 02:32:00.918]  They've done the studies.
[02:32:01.178 --> 02:32:01.818]  You've all seen it.
[02:32:02.679 --> 02:32:04.479]  One person throws up, other people start throwing up.
[02:32:06.420 --> 02:32:08.280]  Like one bird takes off, all the birds take off.
[02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:09.601]  It's a sympathetic response.
[02:32:10.141 --> 02:32:11.361]  I'm not saying that's what happened here.
[02:32:11.782 --> 02:32:15.403]  I'm saying we're not in Kansas anymore, as I've said a thousand times.
[02:32:15.703 --> 02:32:20.164]  Here's the state rep a couple days ago telling Governor Wolf, hey man, wear your mask up on the podium.
[02:32:20.544 --> 02:32:21.965]  It's a political theater.
[02:32:22.005 --> 02:32:22.325]  Here it is.
[02:32:25.841 --> 02:32:36.526]  Whenever I tell you that that's going on, I don't just tell you that for no reason.
[02:32:38.767 --> 02:32:38.847]  So,
[02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:53.690]  Now the president, they say, could be C.O.G.
[02:32:53.730 --> 02:32:55.111]  The doomsday planes are in the air.
[02:32:56.251 --> 02:32:57.651]  The world depression has already started.
[02:32:57.691 --> 02:32:58.871]  Two million have already starved to death.
[02:32:58.891 --> 02:33:00.792]  A hundred plus million could starve to death.
[02:33:00.812 --> 02:33:01.232]  Now the U.N.
[02:33:01.252 --> 02:33:02.472]  says 200-and-something million.
[02:33:02.932 --> 02:33:05.933]  I mean, they've already dominoed things down, so you better get ready.
[02:33:05.953 --> 02:33:07.433]  You've got three days left.
[02:33:07.453 --> 02:33:09.274]  Get the best durable food out there at the lowest price.
[02:33:09.294 --> 02:33:10.154]  It's already a great deal.
[02:33:10.454 --> 02:33:11.474]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:33:12.354 --> 02:33:14.114]  But preparewithalex.com.
[02:33:14.775 --> 02:33:15.935]  You can get
[02:33:17.136 --> 02:33:24.807]  $160 off the three-month, $300 off the six-month, $600 off the year, and already at that price.
[02:33:24.868 --> 02:33:26.630]  That is such a massive discount.
[02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:27.932]  No more excuses.
[02:33:28.313 --> 02:33:29.394]  No more procrastination.
[02:33:30.643 --> 02:33:33.304]  People complain because we're only offering a three-month supply discount.
[02:33:33.344 --> 02:33:35.644]  So they came back with this six-day deal.
[02:33:35.684 --> 02:33:38.045]  It'll be over on, I guess, Monday.
[02:33:38.785 --> 02:33:41.886]  Three days, 11 hours, 31 minutes, 42 seconds.
[02:33:42.586 --> 02:33:45.447]  And if you look at it, one-year supply, $600 off.
[02:33:45.867 --> 02:33:47.567]  Six-month supply, $300 off.
[02:33:48.807 --> 02:33:49.488]  Three-month supply, $160.
[02:33:50.208 --> 02:33:51.848]  They've got discounts on water filtration.
[02:33:52.268 --> 02:33:54.409]  They've got discounts on some of those survival items.
[02:33:55.461 --> 02:33:56.102]  It's a great deal.
[02:33:56.462 --> 02:33:56.862]  Check it out.
[02:33:56.903 --> 02:33:57.924]  PrepareWithAlex.com or 888-411-0350.
[02:33:57.944 --> 02:33:58.364]  That's 888-411-0350.
[02:33:58.404 --> 02:33:59.085]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[02:34:10.484 --> 02:34:16.848]  And separately, at InfoWarsTore.com, they have the full selection of food at the lowest price you're going to find, other than those few specials that are right there.
[02:34:17.149 --> 02:34:18.650]  Those are still some substantive specials.
[02:34:18.970 --> 02:34:20.891]  But the full catalog is at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:34:21.412 --> 02:34:23.553]  InfoWars Emergency Election Sale is going.

[02:34:38.339 --> 02:34:39.381]  That makes it basically a cost.
[02:34:39.401 --> 02:34:40.923]  8-Pack Power Stack.
[02:34:41.243 --> 02:34:41.904]  NX2.
[02:34:42.185 --> 02:34:42.766]  60% off free shipping.
[02:34:44.244 --> 02:34:50.126]  Take advantage of it all, and when we come back, we'll play the clip, and then Dr. Nick Begich will take over.
[02:34:50.146 --> 02:34:56.048]  It's a short clip of the state rep with the governor saying, it's political theater, keep your mask on for the public.
[02:34:56.068 --> 02:35:01.390]  We'll come in, play that, go to Dr. Nick Begich, who I really appreciate taking over from EarthPulse.com.
[02:35:01.710 --> 02:35:05.071]  EarthPulse.com, mark that site, EarthPulse.com.
[02:35:05.091 --> 02:35:05.491]  Stay with us.
[02:35:10.984 --> 02:35:13.726]  So, Wendy, I'm going to take my mask off.
[02:35:14.867 --> 02:35:15.547]  I will as well.
[02:35:15.807 --> 02:35:19.010]  I'm waiting so that we can do a little political theater.
[02:35:21.992 --> 02:35:23.113]  So that it's on camera.
[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:31.622]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:35:31.642 --> 02:35:32.802]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:35:33.042 --> 02:35:34.343]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:35:34.543 --> 02:35:35.924]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:35:36.024 --> 02:35:37.044]  I want them shut down.
[02:35:37.124 --> 02:35:38.025]  I want them silenced.
[02:35:38.065 --> 02:35:38.865]  I want them muted.
[02:35:38.905 --> 02:35:40.686]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:35:40.726 --> 02:35:41.647]  You kept us on air.
[02:35:41.787 --> 02:35:43.067]  We did the analysis first.
[02:35:43.347 --> 02:35:44.348]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:35:44.408 --> 02:35:46.229]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:35:46.489 --> 02:35:52.372]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:35:52.952 --> 02:35:54.033]  You need to stop right now.
[02:35:54.133 --> 02:35:55.214]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:35:55.334 --> 02:35:57.877]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:35:57.897 --> 02:35:58.657]  It's not gonna happen.
[02:35:58.677 --> 02:36:00.579]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[02:36:00.599 --> 02:36:03.482]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[02:36:03.582 --> 02:36:05.223]  Save yourself, save the world.
[02:36:05.524 --> 02:36:06.384]  We're in this together.
[02:36:06.404 --> 02:36:07.485]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:36:08.146 --> 02:36:09.127]  Communism's up here.
[02:36:09.327 --> 02:36:12.290]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[02:36:12.690 --> 02:36:14.492]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:36:14.712 --> 02:36:16.254]  My children are right here!
[02:36:16.994 --> 02:36:18.716]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:36:18.936 --> 02:36:19.977]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:36:20.197 --> 02:36:21.098]  And I need prayer!
[02:36:21.258 --> 02:36:22.199]  And I need action!
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:24.161]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[02:36:24.902 --> 02:36:26.844]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[02:36:27.404 --> 02:36:37.491]  I want to pick up from where everyone kind of left off on this whole manipulation, really what I would call the maximum of propaganda, right?
[02:36:37.571 --> 02:36:45.736]  I mean, we're talking about controlling behavior, we're talking about controlling what people think, we're talking about political correctness.
[02:36:46.357 --> 02:36:52.581]  Really, all of that, when you stop and think about it, then the feedback device, you know, your cell phone to tell you when you're lying,
[02:36:53.081 --> 02:36:53.481]  You know what?
[02:36:54.181 --> 02:37:01.524]  Back when Jim Roderick and I wrote Earth Rising the Revolution, you know, this was in 2000, 20 years ago.
[02:37:02.084 --> 02:37:15.208]  And one of the devices that we mentioned there was the toilets, where you would use the toilet in a public place and analyze your waste and determine all the drugs you're on, get a little DNA sample.
[02:37:15.648 --> 02:37:17.389]  I mean, your whole profile.
[02:37:17.629 --> 02:37:21.050]  And this was where the technology was headed, as we reported it.
[02:37:21.710 --> 02:37:23.730]  Two decades ago, all right?
[02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:36.313]  And so what the doctor was saying about devices, about instant information, about biometrics on this level, this is what the literature said so long ago.
[02:37:36.333 --> 02:37:50.215]  For those that caught last night's Coast to Coast, I was on with George for a couple hours and we've done a lot of shows over the 18 years and we were talking about surveillance technology in terms of its broad
[02:37:50.915 --> 02:37:50.995]  Okay.
[02:38:06.449 --> 02:38:19.541]  Cambridge Analytica and how they feed that back, and how the surveillance capitalism system works for gathering data, feeding it back, selling us garbage we don't need, including politicians we don't want.
[02:38:19.941 --> 02:38:31.591]  You know, but this whole mechanism of gathering feedback, gathering feedback, is an amplification loop that also is like the optimum push-pull.
[02:38:31.711 --> 02:38:32.492]  It's designed
[02:38:33.112 --> 02:38:35.754]  To jam us into a tunnel and keep us there.
[02:38:36.174 --> 02:38:44.518]  And then when you look at the rollout on tagging the population with your little code, what is that about?
[02:38:44.538 --> 02:38:53.463]  It's again another level of commoditizing a human being, making us a piece of meat for consuming until that's inconvenient.
[02:38:54.023 --> 02:38:56.865]  And you know, when I think about all of this,
[02:38:57.245 --> 02:39:01.768]  The dehumanizing of what we are as human beings, which so much of this is done.
[02:39:01.888 --> 02:39:03.209]  Think of the mass media.
[02:39:03.690 --> 02:39:12.556]  Think of the programming fed to all of us through television, through all of it, you know, and media was set up.
[02:39:13.263 --> 02:39:14.003]  The design.
[02:39:14.043 --> 02:39:20.504]  And I was talking about this, you know, from Brave New World, which Alex was talking about earlier in the week, 1984.
[02:39:20.584 --> 02:39:22.685]  You know, the guy died in the early 60s.
[02:39:23.125 --> 02:39:24.265]  He wrote it in 1932.
[02:39:24.905 --> 02:39:30.326]  But what everybody forgets is he also wrote Brave New World Revisited, which I believe was 58.
[02:39:30.626 --> 02:39:32.387]  The year was I was born.
[02:39:32.887 --> 02:39:36.027]  And this was where he went, oh, wow, was I so wrong?
[02:39:36.267 --> 02:39:37.828]  More of an essay, not a storybook.
[02:39:38.288 --> 02:39:38.748]  And he said,
[02:39:39.674 --> 02:39:43.319]  I was so wrong because it's way ahead of where I thought it would be.
[02:39:43.359 --> 02:39:45.782]  And this is in 1958, 62 years ago.
[02:39:45.822 --> 02:39:50.348]  You know, for goodness sake, this is not an accident.
[02:39:50.448 --> 02:39:56.697]  Ladies and gentlemen, it was indeed a script and an understanding that is elevated to the point where
[02:39:57.435 --> 02:40:02.318]  Big tech has been the handmaiden of the intelligence agencies.
[02:40:02.699 --> 02:40:07.842]  Someone, you know, it was asked of me last night about Epstein, you know, and, and I mentioned Alex.
[02:40:07.982 --> 02:40:15.407]  I said, because Alex was talking about this stuff 20 years ago, you know, one of the, one of the earlier conversations I remember Alex, we're talking about all this crazy stuff.
[02:40:16.088 --> 02:40:19.290]  And I thought, you know, this is really over the edge, but I, I trust Alex.
[02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:22.312]  I know Alex, you know, and I wait and see was my attitude.
[02:40:22.372 --> 02:40:25.534]  And as life unfolds and you see all this, you go,
[02:40:26.286 --> 02:40:29.207]  If somebody had told me this 20 years ago, would I believe it?
[02:40:30.027 --> 02:40:31.228]  Well, I wouldn't have discounted.
[02:40:31.268 --> 02:40:32.068]  That's my nature.
[02:40:32.128 --> 02:40:32.568]  And I didn't.
[02:40:33.068 --> 02:40:41.011]  And now we see it unfold for the same reasons that when you develop your data carefully, and then you present it, you go, well, here it is.
[02:40:41.592 --> 02:40:43.912]  Now, what do I really think was going on there?
[02:40:44.633 --> 02:40:50.675]  I think that was an intelligence operation and Epstein made his money by figuring out a way
[02:40:51.542 --> 02:40:58.286]  To extort black male national leaders for the benefit of intelligence agencies, and that's worth a lot of money.
[02:40:58.306 --> 02:41:02.168]  I mean, think about what a B-1 bomber costs, you know, billions of dollars.
[02:41:02.728 --> 02:41:08.031]  Hey, to pay a guy like that a half a billion bucks or, you know, it seems like a huge amount of money, right?
[02:41:08.391 --> 02:41:09.632]  500 million dollars.
[02:41:09.752 --> 02:41:10.652]  Wow.
[02:41:11.473 --> 02:41:19.317]  But if he could extort national leaders in a half a dozen countries, what a cheap investment for a government, right?
[02:41:20.353 --> 02:41:22.294]  Really, think about it from that scale.
[02:41:22.374 --> 02:41:23.554]  It's a cheap investment.
[02:41:24.135 --> 02:41:47.005]  Now you look at what's being rolled out on us by technocrats and something that we've been talking about for a quarter of a century, ladies and gentlemen, and not through speculation, but behind me and in all those cabinets are stacks of books and a couple of firearms, but stacks of books that are intended to develop knowledge.
[02:41:47.025 --> 02:41:49.006]  You know, you want to see my stack for this week?
[02:41:49.066 --> 02:41:49.886]  It's sitting there on the
[02:41:50.546 --> 02:41:51.587]  You know, on the table.
[02:41:52.067 --> 02:42:03.617]  You know, the thing about it is, gather the knowledge, digest it, and dissect it, and then put it out there in a way that we can all look at it together.
[02:42:03.797 --> 02:42:07.680]  That's what InfoWars has always been about.
[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:12.704]  And sometimes it's way out there, and people go, wow, I gotta wait for time to catch up with the truth.
[02:42:13.244 --> 02:42:14.826]  But the fact is, it does.
[02:42:14.846 --> 02:42:15.026]  It did.
[02:42:15.246 --> 02:42:15.446]  It has.
[02:42:15.466 --> 02:42:15.906]  It was.
[02:42:17.432 --> 02:42:29.470]  Alex talks about some of the things we were writing back there that myself and my colleagues we put together and it was like we were predicting the future and it's true we were but not on some esoteric basis but based on the
[02:42:30.097 --> 02:42:36.940]  What they've published for goodness sake and they started calling us aggregators and villainizing us as if that's a bad thing.
[02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:46.023]  They used to call that investigative journalism and that's where I talk about word games and political correctness and why words are so powerful and how you mix words with emotion.
[02:42:46.063 --> 02:42:52.745]  You get what's the essence of occult magic and you also get the force of creativity when you mix it all together in the right way.
[02:42:52.825 --> 02:42:53.886]  What we're intended to do
[02:42:55.111 --> 02:43:02.736]  And these transhumanist dehumanizing aspects of what we're being fed with technology is to take that away from us, to duplicate it.
[02:43:02.776 --> 02:43:23.150]  These are materialists who don't even know, you know, their view of extending the human consciousness is loaded into an AI system that kind of links us all together in sort of a squishy whatever, you know, but they don't understand that consciousness that links us all together is what we are.
[02:43:24.369 --> 02:43:29.470]  And now they want to corrupt our carriers, our bodies, with more BS.
[02:43:29.970 --> 02:43:30.751]  They already have.
[02:43:30.771 --> 02:43:36.232]  You know, we've got synthetic food, we've got GMO, we've got all the garbage they feed us and all the chemicals that are in it.
[02:43:36.732 --> 02:43:39.133]  And here's what I would say about a lot of it.
[02:43:39.913 --> 02:43:43.014]  I've talked about wealth before, what it means, those four factors.
[02:43:43.034 --> 02:43:46.375]  You can look back on band.video and see all that.
[02:43:46.435 --> 02:43:52.016]  But the important thing when you start to look at all this is self-determination, self-sufficiency,
[02:43:53.916 --> 02:43:54.456]  We're in it!
[02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:22.582]  To win it, we don't have to go and wait for the group to form.
[02:44:22.602 --> 02:44:23.883]  It already did.
[02:44:24.563 --> 02:44:46.476]  It's called the human race, the human being that was created to do something different with a set of rights that made us unique for 242 years in this country in a way of thinking that was to break the back of the tyranny that we all lived under in every place on the planet.
[02:44:47.109 --> 02:44:48.831]  And that's what we're talking about.
[02:44:48.911 --> 02:44:50.212]  And you're the tip of the spear.
[02:44:50.632 --> 02:44:55.797]  We're the tip of the spear together because this is the Infowar and we are in it to win.
[02:44:56.397 --> 02:45:02.583]  To win in the 21st century by recognizing who and what we are and act in that way.
[02:45:02.623 --> 02:45:03.343]  We'll be right back.
[02:45:03.384 --> 02:45:06.046]  This is Dr. Nick Begich and you're listening to Infowar.
[02:45:07.157 --> 02:45:08.298]  And welcome back.
[02:45:08.358 --> 02:45:15.842]  You know, I always forget to plug my website earthpulse.com e-a-r-t-h-p-u-l-s-e dot com and go there.
[02:45:16.542 --> 02:45:18.363]  There's a lot of free information there.
[02:45:18.423 --> 02:45:21.544]  There's a link to it says 50 free videos.
[02:45:21.604 --> 02:45:26.227]  And what that is, is it links you right back into what I've been doing on InfoWars for the last couple of years.
[02:45:26.727 --> 02:45:30.289]  And it'll hook you into a chronological list of everything I've been doing.
[02:45:30.962 --> 02:45:34.564]  And if you haven't tuned in before, go back and take a look.
[02:45:34.684 --> 02:45:36.225]  It's all done by Subject Matter.
[02:45:36.245 --> 02:45:43.489]  The guys, the people in the team that put together the graphics and all the things that make it work really do a great job.
[02:45:43.550 --> 02:45:45.551]  So support the InfoWars.
[02:45:46.131 --> 02:45:48.392]  Look at band.video.
[02:45:48.833 --> 02:45:52.455]  Check out the videos of all the various hosts and various issues.
[02:45:53.055 --> 02:45:54.976]  And look at earthpulse.com.
[02:45:55.016 --> 02:45:56.057]  I appreciate it when you do.
[02:45:56.577 --> 02:46:05.565]  You know, just thinking about the last segment in terms of this sort of really rush to push everybody around, and that's really what it is.
[02:46:05.585 --> 02:46:13.732]  It's the rush to be pushed around by a bunch of idiots that really have us on a panic party and know exactly what they're doing.
[02:46:13.772 --> 02:46:15.734]  And here's the thing about panic parties.
[02:46:16.235 --> 02:46:23.456]  When you're in that flight or fight response, if you look at your brain activity under an EEG and examine it, what happens?
[02:46:23.476 --> 02:46:29.137]  You get these very incoherent brain patterns that are associated with flight or fight, right?
[02:46:29.177 --> 02:46:29.797]  I mean, that's it.
[02:46:30.297 --> 02:46:43.840]  But when you're in the calm, in other words, when something bad happens and you see it and you recognize it and you feel the emotion of it, but you pay attention to the emotion of it instead of reacting to it, the brain activity is different.
[02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:45.300]  Now, let me say that again.
[02:46:46.089 --> 02:46:47.150]  Because it's really important.
[02:46:47.650 --> 02:46:57.660]  When you have an emotion and you recognize, whether it's fear or anxiety or any of this, hate, whatever, you know, whatever the thing is you want to tune down a bit, pay attention to it.
[02:46:57.700 --> 02:46:59.762]  As soon as you notice it, you actually control it.
[02:46:59.842 --> 02:47:00.622]  That's the secret.
[02:47:00.642 --> 02:47:01.343]  It's very simple.
[02:47:02.024 --> 02:47:03.185]  But here's the point.
[02:47:04.106 --> 02:47:09.871]  All of the media and the way it's designed now is to whip you up and keep you pushed.
[02:47:10.655 --> 02:47:27.306]  With the adrenaline rush that keeps your brain activity in an incoherent brain pattern that doesn't allow you to reach a higher state of awareness that's associated with higher-ordered intellectual thinking that allows us as sovereign individuals to make better decisions, right?
[02:47:27.426 --> 02:47:28.887]  That's how the brain is supposed to work.
[02:47:29.427 --> 02:47:33.950]  So we have to find the center of the storm when all craziness is all around us.
[02:47:33.970 --> 02:47:34.951]  That's what we're seeing.
[02:47:35.643 --> 02:47:37.244]  That's what Alex was alluding to.
[02:47:37.285 --> 02:47:49.295]  We got to kind of separate ourselves out of the chaos and stand in the calm of who we are and then begin to do what we know we can with confidence.
[02:47:49.775 --> 02:47:51.076]  Not what we're afraid of.
[02:47:51.136 --> 02:47:52.057]  That won't work out.
[02:47:52.137 --> 02:47:54.359]  No, there's other people out there doing that part.
[02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:57.042]  Do the part you're confident in.
[02:47:57.162 --> 02:47:58.763]  That's the secret.
[02:47:58.983 --> 02:47:59.243]  Okay.
[02:47:59.263 --> 02:48:02.026]  And the big secret is that's called faith.
[02:48:02.466 --> 02:48:03.127]  Do what you know.
[02:48:04.051 --> 02:48:10.076]  You can do, and begin to do that in your own way, in the calm of it.
[02:48:10.456 --> 02:48:15.600]  You're always in the calm when you're working in your gift, whatever that is.
[02:48:15.861 --> 02:48:17.722]  Do that, and that'll be all right.
[02:48:17.902 --> 02:48:24.568]  And know that there's millions of other people doing the same, and it never requires millions to change anything.
[02:48:24.608 --> 02:48:25.569]  It only requires one.
[02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:31.952]  Taking the right action in the right moment at the right time and you don't know who that is and it just might be you.
[02:48:32.412 --> 02:48:46.618]  So do that and we get the game going and it goes a different direction because we're not waiting for a group they can infiltrate or a system they can crash because you can't crash human consciousness.
[02:48:47.018 --> 02:48:48.498]  You cannot crash what we are.
[02:48:48.798 --> 02:48:49.739]  Now they don't get it
[02:48:50.379 --> 02:49:01.450]  They think you can embed all that in AI and you can hook it up to a human being and augment the carrier and keep this carrier limping along with your consciousness in it for a while longer.
[02:49:01.870 --> 02:49:03.372]  Yeah, you know, science is pretty good.
[02:49:03.392 --> 02:49:04.593]  You can do a lot of things, but
[02:49:06.522 --> 02:49:12.427]  The expiration date for the physical body does kick in and the consciousness checks out.
[02:49:12.828 --> 02:49:15.070]  And so that's the way it goes.
[02:49:15.871 --> 02:49:27.801]  If you believe that, and most of us get that, it's hard to come to that sometimes when intellect gets in the way and you've got to develop an intellect that allows you to analyze all that and say, you know, that's a logical conclusion.
[02:49:28.715 --> 02:49:30.437]  You know, what you see is what you got.
[02:49:30.577 --> 02:49:45.093]  And here's what I what I'm worried about more than anything else right now is that using technology to get people to agree on things we don't agree on is not a democracy, not a republic, not anything even close.
[02:49:45.654 --> 02:49:46.575]  And that's what
[02:49:47.483 --> 02:49:50.525]  We're concerned about is how they how this can be done.
[02:49:50.725 --> 02:49:57.290]  And the simple thing of your device feeding you back, you're lying, you're lying to get you to say something different, even though you don't believe it.
[02:49:57.830 --> 02:50:00.732]  See, that's the way you break down the psyche.
[02:50:01.352 --> 02:50:10.819]  That's the way you break down your connection, because that little voice in the head that tells you what you need to do gets conflicted when that happens.
[02:50:11.099 --> 02:50:15.662]  And then you start turning off the voice in the head, which is really your consciousness connection.
[02:50:16.497 --> 02:50:20.138]  And that's what you should be listening to, your gut, whatever you want to call it.
[02:50:22.519 --> 02:50:25.620]  But this is your connection to really what we are.
[02:50:25.860 --> 02:50:41.526]  And so having said that, and to strip it down a little tighter here, these technologies have been designed to gather data, feed it back, and manipulate us, and worse, if they can.
[02:50:41.906 --> 02:50:45.187]  So getting everyone to do something, wear a mask, for example,
[02:50:45.951 --> 02:50:48.413]  See, this is again, how does a herd react?
[02:50:48.453 --> 02:50:49.134]  What will happen?
[02:50:49.174 --> 02:50:52.136]  Will people start yelling at other people for not wearing their masks?
[02:50:52.196 --> 02:50:53.517]  Yeah, look around.
[02:50:54.058 --> 02:50:57.781]  Man, there is some hysteria going on over this stuff.
[02:50:59.864 --> 02:51:01.025]  And it's created.
[02:51:01.045 --> 02:51:07.492]  I referenced another book, The Unreality, you know, creation of all of this.
[02:51:07.532 --> 02:51:09.093]  And it was a 1989 book.
[02:51:09.294 --> 02:51:22.747]  And the book was talking about the unreality industry, about the media and fake news in 1989, about the construct of emotionally driven fake news, what we see being rolled out
[02:51:23.550 --> 02:51:25.512]  Systematically over 20 years.
[02:51:25.552 --> 02:51:30.836]  You know, the quality of news reporting, the aggregate quality has diminished.
[02:51:32.097 --> 02:51:34.479]  What's been done in research is phenomenal.
[02:51:34.519 --> 02:51:42.926]  What people can do, you know, and when you look at good, well-researched books with, you know, a third of the book is footnotes of sources that are legitimate,
[02:51:43.450 --> 02:51:46.713]  You know, there's some great material, and I like books.
[02:51:46.813 --> 02:51:51.558]  I like hard copy because it doesn't change online, you know, as you decide to re-narrate history.
[02:51:52.038 --> 02:51:52.999]  I like books.
[02:51:53.379 --> 02:51:55.521]  Printed, document books.
[02:51:55.601 --> 02:51:56.262]  They're useful.
[02:51:56.934 --> 02:52:01.878]  You know, for figuring things out, you know, even now, I mean, you can learn anything online, right?
[02:52:02.098 --> 02:52:04.460]  If you don't mind sharing everything you're learning with everyone else.
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:13.027]  You know, the library used to go into, you could study whatever you want, you could read whatever you want, you could put whatever you want in your head, and it was nobody's business but yours.
[02:52:13.467 --> 02:52:17.891]  Today, because the way systems are set up, that is not the case.
[02:52:19.052 --> 02:52:22.474]  All of that information is held by someone else and then utilized.
[02:52:23.575 --> 02:52:25.597]  And that just is simply wrong.
[02:52:31.096 --> 02:52:32.178]  It's raping us.
[02:52:32.538 --> 02:52:34.360]  It's kicking in your digital doorway.
[02:52:34.741 --> 02:52:35.982]  It's all those things.
[02:52:36.002 --> 02:52:41.769]  And I'm trying to give it the full flavor of what it is because they keep tuning down the length.
[02:52:42.304 --> 02:52:44.905]  Political correctness, a nice name for lying to yourself.
[02:52:45.806 --> 02:52:48.707]  I mean, get real, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:48.847 --> 02:52:54.550]  Let's cut through the focus group new word scheme, you know, because that's what they do here.
[02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:57.972]  What happens is they test ideas.
[02:52:58.012 --> 02:53:00.473]  They don't work so well, so they reframe them.
[02:53:01.033 --> 02:53:02.834]  They change the narrative.
[02:53:02.934 --> 02:53:09.197]  See, we've been talking about this the last several weeks because it's all about a scripted programming.
[02:53:09.873 --> 02:53:15.514]  That is rolled out so effectively with the mediums everyone so willingly dials into.
[02:53:15.594 --> 02:53:22.215]  My fiancé and I have been talking about the children we're finishing up with, our last two, right?
[02:53:22.235 --> 02:53:23.135]  They're 14 and 13.
[02:53:24.275 --> 02:53:29.356]  And talking about just the value systems they're exposed to right now is horrendous.
[02:53:30.376 --> 02:53:37.938]  And the media that they're plugged into is really nothing but a
[02:53:40.146 --> 02:53:41.567]  A gulag of sorts.
[02:53:41.627 --> 02:53:51.833]  You know, when you think about how people are trapped in these various aspects of the digital world, you know, you got to jerk them out of there every once in a while and get them out into the wilderness and do something different.
[02:53:52.293 --> 02:54:02.159]  Get them off of the electronics long enough to breathe and do the things children need to do and young kids need to do and maybe even get in a little bit of trouble occasionally that you have to straighten them out with.
[02:54:02.219 --> 02:54:04.040]  But now's the time.
[02:54:05.160 --> 02:54:10.843]  To rethink about this in terms of our base values, our independence as individuals.
[02:54:11.264 --> 02:54:12.144]  What can we do?
[02:54:12.524 --> 02:54:13.525]  What do we need to do?
[02:54:13.925 --> 02:54:18.048]  And can we simplify our lives in ways that give quality back to it?
[02:54:18.648 --> 02:54:20.549]  How complicated have we made it?
[02:54:21.329 --> 02:54:26.592]  How much have we bought into the other guy's system that isn't ours and doesn't reflect our values?
[02:54:27.413 --> 02:54:30.875]  And it's time to take it back one piece at a time.
[02:54:31.587 --> 02:54:32.787]  Because that's how we lost it.
[02:54:32.907 --> 02:54:33.908]  That's how we get it back.
[02:54:34.068 --> 02:54:34.928]  One piece at a time.
[02:54:35.008 --> 02:54:35.908]  One person at a time.
[02:54:36.448 --> 02:54:37.628]  And let's start with ourselves.
[02:54:37.648 --> 02:54:38.929]  Let's improve who we are.
[02:54:38.949 --> 02:54:41.309]  Let's become stronger information warriors.
[02:54:41.689 --> 02:54:43.510]  More powerful information warriors.
[02:54:43.930 --> 02:54:46.410]  And let's change the way we see the world together.
[02:54:46.510 --> 02:54:48.071]  Because we can.
[02:54:48.151 --> 02:54:50.011]  And we don't have to have their vision in 2020.
[02:54:50.131 --> 02:54:50.851]  Let's get 2020 vision.
[02:54:50.871 --> 02:54:51.571]  A 2020 vision.
[02:54:55.086 --> 02:54:56.147]  For the Infowarrior.
[02:54:56.567 --> 02:54:57.488]  For this century.
[02:54:57.848 --> 02:55:01.430]  For our great-grandchildren who we haven't even probably met yet.
[02:55:02.411 --> 02:55:06.774]  Let's see what we can do with our vision for the future.
[02:55:07.114 --> 02:55:08.775]  Let's take it back from the elite.
[02:55:09.296 --> 02:55:12.237]  Let's go into the weekend with a different view of the world.
[02:55:12.398 --> 02:55:15.440]  A view that says we can take it back.
[02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:18.302]  And we can do it by being the center of the storm.
[02:55:18.362 --> 02:55:19.562]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:55:19.602 --> 02:55:20.423]  Thanks for being here.
[02:55:31.058 --> 02:55:32.919]  You can feel it.
[02:55:32.999 --> 02:55:34.159]  You can see it.
[02:55:34.239 --> 02:55:35.400]  You can taste it.
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:37.680]  You can smell it.
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:39.681]  You can touch it.
[02:55:41.181 --> 02:55:42.722]  And deep in my spirit,
[02:56:00.990 --> 02:56:06.715]  I've got a fiery tingle up and down my spine that goes into my jaw and into my eyes.
[02:56:07.276 --> 02:56:24.111]  I'm on fire right now because I know in the next 40 days of this election and the insanity and the globalist nuclear meltdown that we're going to see when Trump wins, that everything you do and everything I do is going to affect the future of the world for good or for bad.
[02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:30.722]  The globalists have made a very dangerous authoritarian move with all this massive censorship and surveillance.
[02:56:31.322 --> 02:56:32.343]  Just think about censorship.
[02:56:32.403 --> 02:56:35.844]  It takes surveillance of what you're doing and saying to have that censorship.
[02:56:36.424 --> 02:56:38.245]  They've had this massive AI move.
[02:56:38.265 --> 02:56:42.587]  They've had their street bullies out shooting cops and burning down buildings and setting up checkpoints.
[02:56:42.987 --> 02:56:45.448]  They have really launched an authoritarian takeover.
[02:56:46.226 --> 02:56:49.629]  And it's because they're losing the hearts and minds, not just here, but worldwide.
[02:56:49.929 --> 02:56:55.675]  And they know that the tide is turning against them, so they're throwing everything they've got at us right now.
[02:56:56.215 --> 02:57:06.504]  But if we let them normalize all of this tyranny, and their COVID power grab, and their free speech annihilations, and all their physical attacks, then we will go under their tyranny, and they would have broken our will.
[02:57:07.304 --> 02:57:08.585]  And then things are going to get a lot worse.
[02:57:09.366 --> 02:57:23.841]  The New World Order is on record that if they're able to defeat Trump, Bolsonaro, and others around the world that are patriots, if they're able to successfully and effectively silence you and I, that they're going to move to a level very, very quick of unthinkable oppression and total control.
[02:57:24.542 --> 02:57:31.788]  That's why they're admitting that the new forced inoculations coming next year will actually maim and kill a lot of people because Bill Gates knows he can't hide it.
[02:57:32.248 --> 02:57:40.215]  That's why Trump is taking control of the process saying he's going to have an early vaccine from a company that doesn't make one that is so dangerous or that doesn't change our DNA.
[02:57:40.435 --> 02:57:43.037]  And I'm not even forcing what Trump's doing, but I understand what he's doing.
[02:57:43.738 --> 02:57:46.700]  So, things have been critical for 20 plus years that I've been on air.
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:53.166]  They were critical before that, but they're all building, building, building, building towards this moment now and what is going to happen in the future.
[02:57:53.891 --> 02:58:01.912]  And so the way we respond to this now and the way we take action to this now is like a game of pool when you first break the balls.
[02:58:02.472 --> 02:58:07.813]  It's going to dictate so much of the coming game how we carry this out right now.
[02:58:08.113 --> 02:58:10.614]  So ladies and gentlemen, pray to God for a global awakening.
[02:58:11.094 --> 02:58:19.155]  Pray to God to give you discernment and lead God and direct you to know how to fight the enemy politically, spiritually, culturally, financially, and physically if they attack you defend yourself.
[02:58:19.695 --> 02:58:22.436]  And realize that InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear.
[02:58:23.220 --> 02:58:24.121]  We're seeing a lot of folks come through.
[02:58:24.141 --> 02:58:25.422]  We're seeing orders massively increase.
[02:58:50.811 --> 02:58:53.272]  But with everything going on, it's still not enough.
[02:58:53.332 --> 02:58:55.072]  So get products you already need.
[02:58:55.092 --> 02:58:56.293]  Get high-quality, storable food.
[02:58:56.333 --> 02:59:05.816]  Get books, films, supplements that are so good for your body, so good for your immune system, and know that you are funding an operation that is challenging the globalists effectively on a massive scale.
[02:59:06.496 --> 02:59:07.756]  Thank you so much for all you've done.
[02:59:07.796 --> 02:59:15.819]  I salute you, and I ask you to now count the costs, look at the historical juncture point we're at, and to make the right decision at this fork in the road.
[02:59:16.199 --> 02:59:19.640]  I'm Alex Jones, and if you're watching this, never forget, you are the resistance.
[02:59:32.500 --> 02:59:35.902]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:59:35.922 --> 02:59:37.063]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:59:37.083 --> 02:59:38.644]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:59:38.824 --> 02:59:40.225]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:59:40.305 --> 02:59:41.326]  I want them shut down.
[02:59:41.386 --> 02:59:42.286]  I want them silenced.
[02:59:42.346 --> 02:59:43.047]  I want them muted.
[02:59:43.067 --> 02:59:44.968]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:59:44.988 --> 02:59:45.929]  You kept us on air.
[02:59:46.069 --> 02:59:47.370]  We did the analysis first.
[02:59:47.630 --> 02:59:48.630]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:59:48.690 --> 02:59:50.492]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:59:50.772 --> 02:59:56.716]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:59:56.896 --> 02:59:58.357]  And you need to stop right now.
[02:59:58.437 --> 02:59:59.497]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:59:59.657 --> 03:00:01.979]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[03:00:02.159 --> 03:00:04.822]  This is not going to happen, so they are moving now to destroy me.
[03:00:04.842 --> 03:00:07.745]  I used to say support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[03:00:07.845 --> 03:00:09.486]  Save yourself, save the world.
[03:00:09.807 --> 03:00:10.668]  We're in this together.
[03:00:10.688 --> 03:00:18.796]  Because let me tell you something, communism's up here, InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting, and you and I are all down here with our families.
[03:00:18.996 --> 03:00:20.477]  My children are right here!
[03:00:21.258 --> 03:00:22.979]  But I need money to fight a war!
[03:00:23.199 --> 03:00:24.260]  And I need word of mouth!
[03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:25.381]  And I need prayer!
[03:00:25.521 --> 03:00:26.481]  And I need action!
[03:00:26.862 --> 03:00:28.443]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[03:00:29.163 --> 03:00:31.104]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[03:00:36.229 --> 03:00:41.975]  And I want to just salute Keith Bessemer and the folks at MyPatriotSupply because they've been a sponsor for 13 years.
[03:00:42.475 --> 03:00:43.636]  They've been around 14 years.
[03:00:44.177 --> 03:00:46.579]  They immediately bought up some of the bigger, better companies.
[03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:48.281]  We immediately got good feedback.
[03:00:48.862 --> 03:00:50.163]  I didn't want a bunch of food sponsors.
[03:00:50.223 --> 03:00:51.444]  I wanted one good one I could trust.
[03:00:51.484 --> 03:00:51.865]  I got them.
[03:00:52.465 --> 03:00:55.428]  And so we sell their whole food line at FullRestore.com.
[03:00:57.011 --> 03:01:11.114]  Because of the communist Chinese attacks on our servers, and where you've got to put in a little code to prove you're a human to get in, and the rest of it, just decimating the amount of folks that get in infowarestore.com to buy the books, the films, the water filtration, the supplements.
[03:01:12.374 --> 03:01:14.915]  I called them a few weeks ago, and I said, look, we're under this attack.
[03:01:15.435 --> 03:01:19.176]  Can you just set up a URL for us, and then we get a percentage of the sales we get?
[03:01:19.196 --> 03:01:22.356]  Because I've got to move in to just not even having our websites anymore.
[03:01:22.396 --> 03:01:23.877]  I mean, we're under this level of attack.
[03:01:25.854 --> 03:01:27.916]  They weren't sure they could even do it in a month.
[03:01:28.116 --> 03:01:28.576]  Boom!
[03:01:29.277 --> 03:01:31.899]  And Keith Bessemer, the president of MyPatreon, goes, oh, no, no.
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:33.561]  We got it done for you.
[03:01:34.762 --> 03:01:40.927]  And so a discount on top of everything at a special URL that leads you to a special page.
[03:01:41.848 --> 03:01:45.190]  $170 discount on something that's already the best price you're going to find.
[03:01:45.210 --> 03:01:47.272]  So again, Keith, you've got the floor here.
[03:01:47.312 --> 03:01:49.214]  Tell folks about the special that's running right now.
[03:01:49.254 --> 03:01:53.137]  This is unprecedented because you guys already have the lowest price for the quality of food you've got.
[03:01:53.177 --> 03:01:54.038]  That's well known in the industry.
[03:01:54.338 --> 03:01:58.221]  So the three things are the air, the food, and the water.
[03:01:58.902 --> 03:02:07.089]  We've talked about the food, and the first time we've been able to run a sale or a special all year because we've worked so hard with the suppliers to get the $100 savings.
[03:02:07.509 --> 03:02:10.591]  That's exclusive right now with preparewithalex.com.
[03:02:11.292 --> 03:02:13.854]  Then there's the water, and this is just as important.
[03:02:13.894 --> 03:02:15.676]  You know, you only can live three days without water.
[03:02:16.116 --> 03:02:20.660]  This is a kit we've never offered before that could help support the InfoWar.
[03:02:20.740 --> 03:02:23.182]  And for your viewers, your listeners, Alex,
[03:02:23.689 --> 03:02:29.097]  It's the Alexa Pure Pro that you always hear about, and that only comes with one filter that filters up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:02:29.578 --> 03:02:34.746]  Well, we've kind of amped this up, just like that sports car you were talking about there 20 minutes ago, the Shelby and all.
[03:02:35.106 --> 03:02:39.573]  We've amped this baby up where you can put four filters into the Alexa Pure Pro.
[03:02:40.189 --> 03:02:47.571]  This thing can flow with gravity, meaning no electricity, and purify up to 20,000 gallons of water.
[03:02:47.591 --> 03:02:50.792]  It sits on a nice stand that comes included in this kit.
[03:02:51.212 --> 03:02:56.854]  You can put some of the water into a collapsible water storage container, and we've even given you replacement parts.
[03:02:56.914 --> 03:03:04.176]  Today, on this site, RepairWithAlex.com, the Alexa Pure Pro Ultimate Kit is with $170 savings.
[03:03:06.564 --> 03:03:07.925]  So that's all sitting there as well.
[03:03:08.226 --> 03:03:09.727]  And then, of course, the Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:03:09.787 --> 03:03:16.394]  I mean, what a mess with the air and all the problems, wildfires from the West Coast blowing all the way across the northern states.
[03:03:16.814 --> 03:03:19.316]  New York was showing pictures yesterday of it and such.
[03:03:19.637 --> 03:03:22.279]  You don't want to breathe that junk in your home.
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:25.562]  That's what the Alexa Pure Breathe is all about.
[03:03:25.662 --> 03:03:27.444]  It's an indoor air filtration unit.
[03:03:27.764 --> 03:03:31.348]  It has a true HEPA system inside, a four-stage process that helps
[03:03:32.001 --> 03:03:32.542]  I think so.
[03:03:51.804 --> 03:03:52.365]  We're good to go.
[03:04:09.238 --> 03:04:13.420]  I know I guess I'm locked into some type of funding, but this is very, very exciting.
[03:04:13.460 --> 03:04:15.360]  Preparewithalex.com.
[03:04:15.380 --> 03:04:16.481]  Preparewithalex.com.
[03:04:16.921 --> 03:04:19.742]  This is no doubt the best deals anywhere.
[03:04:19.762 --> 03:04:21.763]  This is the best deal you're going to find ever.
