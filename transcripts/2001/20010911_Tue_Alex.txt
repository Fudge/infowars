[00:00.000 --> 00:03.760]  Like the Fed can profit from lending U.S. currency, but when its member banks get into
[00:03.760 --> 00:07.840]  financial trouble, a government institution called the FDIC will bail them out.
[00:07.840 --> 00:12.560]  Is it good business for taxpayers to print Fed's currency taking payment for materials
[00:12.560 --> 00:17.040]  and labor in the same species? Should we have to take on debt and have money for commerce?
[00:17.040 --> 00:22.800]  In 1791, Jefferson debated Hamilton, refusing to leave our country in the grip of perpetual debt.
[00:22.800 --> 00:32.880]  Knowledge is power for a free banking report. Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32.880 --> 00:40.720]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:40.720 --> 00:49.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:49.600 --> 00:53.920]  Well, I've been warning you about it for at least five years. All terrorism that we've
[00:53.920 --> 00:59.680]  looked at from the World Trade Center of Oklahoma City to Waco has been government actions.
[00:59.680 --> 01:05.440]  They need this as a pretext to bring you and your family martial law. They're either using
[01:05.440 --> 01:12.800]  provocateur Arabs and allowing them to do it, or this is full complicity with the federal
[01:12.800 --> 01:16.400]  government. The evidence is overwhelming to bring you up to speed on what's happened
[01:16.400 --> 01:24.800]  at 8.50 a.m. EDT. Plane hits World Trade Center 920. FBI says at least one plane hijacked 930.
[01:24.800 --> 01:29.520]  Eastern second jet crashes into World Trade Center. Plane hits Pentagon 940. Federal
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.360]  officials said a U.S. airplane has hit the Pentagon. The crash comes nearly an hour after
[01:33.360 --> 01:37.520]  two planes hit the World Trade Center building. All U.S. buildings in Capitol Hill evacuated
[01:37.520 --> 01:46.160]  1013. 1015. World Trade Center South Tower collapses. 1020. Report explosion at Capitol. 1030. U.S.
[01:46.160 --> 01:49.840]  congressional leaders top cabinet officials moving to secure facilities. 1030. Anchor
[01:50.960 --> 01:55.920]  another hijacked plane reported 20 minutes south of Washington, D.C. Second tower north
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.000]  collapses. Hijacked plane crashes south of Pittsburgh, PA. Officials investigating it
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.640]  another hijacking with a plane headed towards D.C. And 1045. All federal buildings in D.C.
[02:06.640 --> 02:11.040]  have been evacuated. And then we're told other planes are in the air. They're finding bombs at
[02:11.040 --> 02:14.400]  schools. We don't know how many of these reports are accurate. We know the two planes have crashed
[02:14.400 --> 02:19.840]  into the World Trade Center. Both columns, both buildings with 50,000 plus people in them,
[02:19.840 --> 02:24.480]  have collapsed in the last hour. They did a simulcast with the Derry-Brownfield syndicated
[02:24.480 --> 02:30.160]  program. We had Jim Wright on, who's a family friend of mine who lives out in Fredericksburg,
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.520]  Texas. He's in an investment banking and leasing and was in the building right next door
[02:35.520 --> 02:41.200]  to the World Trade Center towers. The one World Trade Center towers, as they're now called,
[02:41.200 --> 02:48.480]  piles of dead bodies everywhere, body parts up to six blocks away. The buildings are absolutely
[02:48.480 --> 02:56.000]  leveled. He was right there in the midst of it. This is pandemic. This is one of the biggest
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.560]  stories of the last century and now in to the 21st century. We're going to have Dave
[03:02.560 --> 03:07.920]  von Kleis and Joyce Riley joining us. Other Genesis hosts, one of which lives in New York,
[03:07.920 --> 03:12.880]  but we have an eyewitness coming up after this break in his cell phone holes. Jim Wright,
[03:12.880 --> 03:17.280]  we also have a landline for him, but landlines aren't working too well. There are massive
[03:17.280 --> 03:23.680]  phone line and digital phone line disturbances across the country. We're having trouble connecting
[03:23.680 --> 03:28.640]  the ISD in line to Liberty Works Radio Network based in Maryland. Are we connected with them yet?
[03:28.640 --> 03:34.160]  We will continue to bring you all of this information. I know we're carried by a lot of
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.240]  stations that don't normally carry the show because they know that I have been predicting
[03:38.240 --> 03:44.480]  this for years. If you go to infowars.com, you'll find some interesting evidence there.
[03:45.280 --> 03:50.240]  The story from back in April out of the Baltimore Sun where the joint chiefs of staff were caught
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.920]  wanting to blow up civilian airliners, attack the Marines at Guantanamo Bay using an army company
[03:55.920 --> 04:03.440]  disguised as Cubans, bomb Washington DC. We have the James Bamford story,
[04:04.720 --> 04:10.560]  best-selling author, former 2020 executive with the CIA and NSA documents. The feds wanted to
[04:10.560 --> 04:16.400]  blow up civilian airlines, wanted to bomb Washington, wanted to shoot people in Miami as a pretext to
[04:16.400 --> 04:24.720]  invade Cuba in 1962. That is on infowars.com, mainstream, but Kennedy said no. Six months
[04:24.720 --> 04:31.920]  later his head was blown off. We have become a different society in 2001. Back in 1993,
[04:31.920 --> 04:37.280]  it was in the New York Times, October 28th that the feds trained the bombers, trained the drivers,
[04:37.280 --> 04:42.160]  cooked the bomb and allowed that bombing to go forward. They got caught because one of the
[04:42.160 --> 04:46.800]  informants recorded the FBI telling him to let the bombing go forward because he was worried about
[04:46.800 --> 04:52.160]  being framed for it. What am I saying? I'm saying who stands to gain from this? Who has the motive?
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.560]  Who can bring you martial law and destroy your freedom? The government, it's not our government,
[04:56.560 --> 05:04.720]  stay with us. The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[05:04.720 --> 05:07.040]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[05:07.040 --> 05:23.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, in the last hour I was on with Derry Brownfield. We'll be
[05:23.360 --> 05:26.800]  joining us a little bit later in the show, syndicated talk show host. We talked to Jim Wright,
[05:26.800 --> 05:31.280]  one of my family friends who is an investment banker who lives in Fredericksburg, Texas,
[05:31.280 --> 05:38.160]  but lives half a year in New York. He was in the building on the banking center's right next door
[05:38.800 --> 05:43.040]  to the World Trade Center towers when the first jets slammed into it this morning,
[05:43.040 --> 05:48.480]  then another one slammed into it. He was there as the towers collapsed, dead bodies up to six
[05:48.480 --> 05:56.160]  blocks away, arms, legs, you name it, another hijacked plane crashed south of Pittsburgh,
[05:56.160 --> 06:01.760]  PA, officials investigating it, another hijacking with the plane headed towards DC.
[06:02.960 --> 06:10.240]  They are declaring a threat com level Delta, the highest military threat under threat com Delta.
[06:10.240 --> 06:14.320]  They are loading the nuclear bombs onto the planes, the missiles are ready,
[06:14.960 --> 06:20.400]  everybody is buzzing around on the streets like bees, radios and televisions are on. People are
[06:20.400 --> 06:25.120]  absolutely focused into it. We haven't seen something in this magnitude since the Kennedy
[06:25.120 --> 06:33.280]  assassination back in 1963. We were able to get Jim via his cell phone there on the scene amongst
[06:33.280 --> 06:38.800]  all of the carnage. We should be praying for the dead and dying and praying for this country
[06:38.800 --> 06:44.640]  and the God heal this land, this modern Babylon that would create something like this. I'll tell
[06:44.640 --> 06:50.640]  you the bottom line, 98 percent chance this was a government orchestrated control bombing.
[06:50.640 --> 06:55.360]  I've been telling you this was going to happen just two weeks ago. I put the call out again
[06:55.360 --> 07:00.800]  for operation expose the government terrorist. We are not anti-government, we are anti-corrupt
[07:00.800 --> 07:07.360]  New World Order system that is taking control of our government every day. I read news stories
[07:07.360 --> 07:10.320]  where they were telling you that we were going to be hit by terrorists, that it was going to
[07:10.320 --> 07:15.120]  happen anytime, give up your rights. They've been telling us we're going to get hit by anthrax,
[07:15.120 --> 07:20.960]  we're going to get hit by smallpox. The AP reported on a secret meeting with the Joint Chiefs of
[07:20.960 --> 07:27.760]  Staff, the heads of the media with fake newscast they produced back in June where they predicted
[07:27.760 --> 07:34.240]  one to four million dead for anthrax. Martial law was the term used. I'm not saying this is going
[07:34.240 --> 07:39.920]  to happen, but they've been preparing for it and they have been saying it's going to happen.
[07:39.920 --> 07:46.080]  Repeat, they plan to blow up airlines and bomb Washington in 1962, Joint Chiefs of Staff documents
[07:46.080 --> 07:52.080]  confirmed by the Baltimore Sun and James Bamford, retired 2020 executive who's been on this show.
[07:52.640 --> 07:56.720]  Oklahoma City was a government bombing. We've proven that with General Benton Parton,
[07:56.720 --> 08:03.360]  former head of Air Force weapons development on this show. We have also proven it with Dr.
[08:03.360 --> 08:08.800]  Frederick Whitehurst, former head of the FBI crime lab, Hoppy Heidelberg, Grand Jurb. We know Waco
[08:08.800 --> 08:14.160]  was a government action and only government stands to gain from this horrible event.
[08:16.240 --> 08:21.520]  Only the police state. Now we have Chris McCarskey who is a Genesis broadcaster and who lives in
[08:21.520 --> 08:29.120]  New York. Going back to Jim Wright, I witness family friends that I know personally. Jim,
[08:29.120 --> 08:34.320]  tell us where you work, what you saw and basically run down for this audience exactly what developed
[08:34.320 --> 08:41.840]  this morning at 8.50 a.m. when the first plane slapped in, slammed into the South World Trade
[08:41.840 --> 08:46.000]  Center. Go ahead, sir. Sure, Alex. I'm in the World Trade Center. I was at that time in the
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.160]  World Finance Center directly across the street from the World Trade Center, between the World
[08:50.160 --> 08:58.640]  Trade Center and the Hudson River. We heard a shock, you know, 10, 10 till 9 or so. I actually
[08:58.640 --> 09:05.120]  saw walls vibrating in some of the neighboring buildings. Heard a noise. It sounded like cherry
[09:05.120 --> 09:12.640]  bombs followed by almost like a dump truck dumping gravel sound. We looked out one side of our
[09:12.640 --> 09:18.240]  building where I thought the noise came from on the river side. That wasn't it. We went back to
[09:18.240 --> 09:25.600]  the front and at that point a number of people lined up on the 15th floor watching one World
[09:25.600 --> 09:33.280]  Trade Center burn. It was burning from about the hundredth floor up. While we were watching it,
[09:33.280 --> 09:39.920]  you could actually see bodies coming out of the windows. Some were obviously dead. Others were
[09:39.920 --> 09:46.960]  flailing as they came down. Were they on fire? Just smoke. Just smoke. That's a little gruesome, but
[09:46.960 --> 09:59.360]  I'm getting the details. Yeah, anyway, after the third or fourth party we observed come out,
[10:01.360 --> 10:06.000]  they were trying to set us assured in our building that it was another building that was
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.720]  affected. We shouldn't be concerned. Well, about that time, the second plane hit. We actually saw
[10:12.720 --> 10:22.240]  that all the flames shoot out hundreds of feet. That plane looked like it hit maybe the 80th floor,
[10:23.200 --> 10:30.560]  75th to 80th floor. At that point we knew this was a target. We evacuated the building, our building,
[10:30.560 --> 10:36.400]  and went out towards the Hudson River to catch a ferry back across the river. Yeah, this is not a
[10:36.400 --> 10:45.440]  B-23 in World War II and fog crashing into the Empire State Building. No, no, no. The plane that
[10:45.440 --> 10:52.640]  we saw looked like a full-sized passenger plane, not necessarily a big wide body. What color was
[10:52.640 --> 10:59.440]  the plane? All I saw was like a flash of white, Alex. Just barely caught the glimpse of, I'm not
[10:59.440 --> 11:07.600]  even sure if it was a fin section or the tip of the wing. Watching the footage of a passenger plane,
[11:07.600 --> 11:12.400]  a medium-sized passenger plane slamming into the World Trade Center and exploding out the other side,
[11:12.400 --> 11:17.280]  that was so surreal. What was it like to see it with your own two eyes, Jim? It's like it was
[11:17.280 --> 11:24.240]  slow motion. It's like a movie. It's like reading a techno thriller. You just can't believe something
[11:24.240 --> 11:32.080]  like this really, truly can happen. Jim, I guess the perfect word. Absolutely. We appreciate you
[11:32.080 --> 11:35.760]  joining us, and I know your family is very happy and proud that you're alive and listening right
[11:35.760 --> 11:43.120]  now on 91.7 FM. What exactly developed after the second plane slammed into the building?
[11:43.120 --> 11:50.400]  Well, we got out and went to the river side to catch a ferry. We still saw several more bodies
[11:50.400 --> 11:59.040]  come out. We got across the river and we were watching the buildings. Suddenly, at one World
[11:59.040 --> 12:05.840]  Trade Center, you could hear the shock. It looked like an explosion or things blowing out from around
[12:05.840 --> 12:13.920]  the 70th or 80th floor all the way around the building. The building just dropped straight down.
[12:13.920 --> 12:20.560]  The building was literally gone within five seconds. Alex, I used to be a structural engineer,
[12:20.560 --> 12:25.600]  and I've watched buildings implode. It was the most perfect implosion I've ever seen in my life.
[12:26.320 --> 12:32.160]  It came straight down in one monolithic piece. Now, you are a structural engineer. How could
[12:32.160 --> 12:36.640]  fire in the upper floors, you say one plane hit about the 100th floor, the other hitting about
[12:36.640 --> 12:42.480]  the 70th floor, how does that cause a building to completely collapse? I don't believe it does,
[12:42.480 --> 12:48.480]  Alex. I mean, looking at the way the building came down, it looked like there was charges up
[12:48.480 --> 12:53.600]  around the 70th, but I just got to believe there was also charges at the base of the building.
[12:54.800 --> 13:00.640]  And to bring something down that fast, one of the things has to happen. The charges have to be
[13:00.640 --> 13:08.320]  so perfectly placed. I mean, engineered, or there has to be so much there that it just obliterates
[13:08.320 --> 13:14.880]  everything. Jim Wright, this is like a bad nightmare. I know you're familiar with what I do. I have
[13:14.880 --> 13:19.680]  produced a film showing the feds removing unexploded bombs from the columns at the Oklahoma
[13:19.680 --> 13:24.800]  City Building that was blown out, obviously not blown in. This is government. What you have just
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.400]  told us, sir, I saw those buildings collapse. You were right there. I was watching it on the news.
[13:30.400 --> 13:37.360]  They wanted massive death. So you're saying as a structural engineer, you are witnessing this,
[13:37.360 --> 13:44.000]  it is collapsing, and then both the structures only placed charges are so precise. Is that what
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.600]  you're saying? That's what it appeared to be, Alex. And I'm not a PE, a professional engineer,
[13:49.600 --> 13:59.040]  but I studied at the master's level and I had a degree. They were just perfect
[13:59.040 --> 14:05.200]  enclosures, both of them. The second building came down a little bit slower. The first one
[14:05.200 --> 14:12.880]  took five seconds. The second building took 10. The corner outside corner column stayed up
[14:12.880 --> 14:17.440]  for a bit, but then just because of lack of stability, they came down also.
[14:18.880 --> 14:25.200]  So you're telling me, sir, again, exactly what's your job there at the World Financial Center?
[14:25.200 --> 14:31.040]  Well, I'm a financial analysis with one of the accounting firms, one of the big five accounting
[14:31.040 --> 14:38.960]  firms, and I've been out of engineering for close to 20 years. I want to qualify what I
[14:38.960 --> 14:43.120]  understand. But still, we've all seen buildings get blown up on the news in Las Vegas when they're
[14:43.120 --> 14:47.760]  getting rid of them, how they collapse symmetrically. And then this was one of the most symmetrical
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.480]  collapses I've ever seen, but then it was obscured by smoke. What did you see there? Where were you
[14:52.480 --> 14:58.320]  on the ground when the first tower collapsed, Jim? I was across the river, across the Hudson River,
[14:58.320 --> 15:05.760]  about a block from the waterfront, but we had a perfect view of everything. I would say this is
[15:05.760 --> 15:14.320]  about a mile and a half away from the World Trade Center site. Now I'm sitting on the back of my
[15:14.320 --> 15:19.760]  boat in a marina at the Statue of Liberty Park, and I'm about still about a mile and a half from
[15:19.760 --> 15:25.440]  the site. Now we have the top third and the top halves of these buildings burning, and suddenly
[15:25.440 --> 15:29.840]  they just collapse. So they're steel reinforced. You would think that they would just lean over to
[15:29.840 --> 15:36.000]  the side or fall over, not completely collapse. That's exactly what you would think, Alex. You
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.440]  would have thought they would have come down so much slow that they would have been. They would
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.720]  have distorted. Jim, you know I could have blew up Oklahoma City. Do you see how the government
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.840]  could stand again to bring us a police state from this happening? Alex, I'm not even going to go
[15:49.840 --> 15:57.600]  there. I have no opinion on that. I'll just tell you the facts I see. I'm not going to speculate
[15:57.600 --> 16:03.120]  who did this or anything like that. That's way beyond my knowledge base. Certainly you heard
[16:03.120 --> 16:09.600]  about Hitler burning the Reichstag as a pretext to declare martial law. Hitler burning the Reichstag
[16:09.600 --> 16:16.640]  as a pretext to declare martial law. I've been predicting this for five years. I'm just so glad
[16:16.640 --> 16:22.640]  that you're alive. Have you had a chance to talk to your wife? Yeah, I have, Alex. As far as I know,
[16:22.640 --> 16:28.640]  you know, all the people I know got out and we're just, you know, we're very thankful we're not a
[16:28.640 --> 16:33.440]  victim. Well, Jim, we've got to break again. I want to ask you questions about what happened
[16:33.440 --> 16:38.160]  after the two buildings collapsed, the carnage, what authorities were doing. Can you stay with
[16:38.160 --> 16:44.160]  us for 10 more minutes? Sure, Alex. All right, we're talking to Jim Wright, my good buddy Kevin
[16:44.160 --> 16:52.720]  Booth. His sister is Mr. Wright's wife, and I've enjoyed many good dinners and out there at Credit
[16:52.720 --> 16:59.120]  Park with him. It's just amazing. Then we'll go to Derry Brownfield. Hey, folks, Alex Jones here,
[16:59.120 --> 17:03.600]  and I wouldn't have believed it myself if I hadn't seen it with my own two eyes. You've heard the
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.480]  rumors of the dark workings of the global elite. Now I have proof from the secret of Bohemian Club.
[17:08.480 --> 17:13.120]  Many of our world leaders are heavily involved in occult practices. Here are just a few clips from
[17:13.120 --> 17:24.960]  my two hour film. It's bad to have something as secret elite and pagan at the same time. Yeah,
[17:24.960 --> 17:30.720]  feels like Satan's building his home. Satan's building his army. It's part of public record
[17:30.720 --> 17:34.720]  that world leaders attend. How could any of us sleep knowing that the people controlling our
[17:34.720 --> 17:40.160]  lives are involved in dark occult activity? Help us expose this evil, order dark secrets inside

[19:56.800 --> 20:01.920]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can
[20:01.920 --> 20:06.240]  have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[20:06.240 --> 20:10.080]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[20:10.080 --> 20:16.080]  to the skin. The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron and
[20:16.080 --> 20:21.360]  it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower. The media is non-toxic,
[20:21.360 --> 20:27.360]  environmentally sound, and is recyclable. The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons
[20:27.360 --> 20:31.840]  or one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities
[20:31.840 --> 20:38.320]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your

[21:02.480 --> 21:07.680]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[21:08.880 --> 21:15.600]  Securities, commodities have stopped trading globally. Stuff is going absolutely not on the
[21:15.600 --> 21:22.160]  stock markets from China to London. It's just pandemic and sanity financially. We have Derry
[21:22.160 --> 21:25.680]  Brownfield syndicated broadcaster on the line. I know Derry will hold right there because I want to
[21:25.680 --> 21:31.440]  get his study analysis of all of this as well. We have other listeners in New York that will be
[21:31.440 --> 21:36.400]  able to come on the show. We have an eyewitness on right now coming up financial news for you,
[21:36.400 --> 21:40.560]  which is really central to all of this. Jim Wright, you're in the whole financial sector,
[21:40.560 --> 21:46.160]  working at some of the highest levels of this. Talk about what was housed in that world trade
[21:46.160 --> 21:50.400]  center and how you think this will affect the markets and then, of course, continuing with
[21:50.400 --> 21:56.960]  what you saw after the two towers collapsed. Sure. Obviously, everything is just going to
[21:56.960 --> 22:01.120]  shut down. I don't think any of the buildings, even around the trade center,
[22:01.920 --> 22:07.200]  will be able to open for quite a while. It's still hot here. Everybody has the air conditioning
[22:07.200 --> 22:13.040]  systems on, so they're drawing tremendous amounts of smoke and debris into the buildings.
[22:13.040 --> 22:21.040]  Back when the trade center was bombed, I know it was weak that it took to just get all the smoke
[22:21.040 --> 22:27.680]  damage and debris damage out of surrounding buildings. How many blocks did the collapse
[22:27.680 --> 22:32.320]  of the buildings create? It looked like it was stretching for 100 blocks. As far as the actual
[22:32.320 --> 22:37.280]  blast, there's no way I could tell from my vantage point. You were right there in it.
[22:37.280 --> 22:44.720]  I was across the street. Because there are so many tall buildings around you,
[22:44.720 --> 22:51.200]  you really can't see more than a block away. Where are you now, Jim? Alex, I'm across the Hudson
[22:51.200 --> 22:58.640]  River near about half a mile from the Statue of Liberty and about a mile and a half from the
[22:58.640 --> 23:06.880]  trade center site. What are the authorities doing? It's just solid sirens everywhere. On this side
[23:06.880 --> 23:13.920]  of the river, they're just trying to move people away from the river. A lot of berries and various
[23:13.920 --> 23:19.040]  emergency vehicles are both bringing people into our marina to load on the ambulances.
[23:19.680 --> 23:23.520]  I don't know if they're picking people up from the side or out of the water. I haven't been
[23:23.520 --> 23:28.640]  down. How many people worked in the trade center? I'm told it's at least 50,000. We were speculating
[23:28.640 --> 23:33.040]  between 40 and 50,000. And if both buildings collapsed, do you have any idea how many people
[23:33.040 --> 23:40.000]  got out? Surely I don't. People tend to start the day. I mean, maybe it's fortunate. People
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.520]  start the day a little bit later here just because of the time zone we're in. So you do have a lot
[23:45.520 --> 23:51.680]  of people that are still pulling into work after 9 o'clock between 9 and 10. So the fact that it
[23:51.680 --> 23:58.160]  was at least before 9 should be helpful. One thing I'll point out is just looking at the amount
[23:58.160 --> 24:05.360]  of time between the time the planes hit and the time that these buildings were imploded, however
[24:05.360 --> 24:11.520]  that was brought about. In one hand, it was almost like they were giving people time, what people
[24:11.520 --> 24:18.400]  could be evacuated, civilians to be evacuated. But it seemed like it was about 45 minutes,
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.760]  which also seemed like... It was almost like they were giving them time to evacuate. Again,
[24:24.800 --> 24:31.520]  degreed in the structural engineer area. You're saying it was the most beautiful implosion
[24:31.520 --> 24:36.560]  you've ever seen and of some of the biggest buildings in the world. Absolutely. It was
[24:36.560 --> 24:41.200]  perfectly engineered as far as the way it came down. But you know, when you think about the
[24:41.200 --> 24:46.320]  amount of time that passed between the initial head and the implosions, it almost appears that if
[24:46.320 --> 24:52.720]  it was designed to maximize the number of emergency personnel that would be affected because,
[24:52.720 --> 24:59.280]  you know, as you're bringing civilians out, you're shipping tactical emergency personnel
[24:59.280 --> 25:06.400]  into the building and it just seems like this was engineered in a lot of ways.
[25:06.400 --> 25:09.360]  Well, I think it's safe to say now that I'm going to cancel the Janet Reno
[25:09.360 --> 25:16.960]  protest or it may still go forward in Waco tomorrow or two days from now. Jim, what were you feeling?
[25:16.960 --> 25:20.800]  I mean, what was going through your mind as the plane, the second one, exploded out the other
[25:20.800 --> 25:26.240]  end of the building at about the 75th floor and then they collapsed and now watching all of this
[25:26.240 --> 25:36.000]  bedlam? Oh, it was just the thought that this is not an accident or a building failure. This is
[25:36.000 --> 25:43.440]  a deliberate act of sabotage in some form. This whole area is a target and the thing to do is
[25:43.440 --> 25:48.640]  just to leave the building calmly while everybody else in the building is also behaving calmly.
[25:48.640 --> 25:56.240]  And we don't want to forget the Pentagon has been hit by a large aircraft also in Pennsylvania
[25:56.240 --> 26:02.400]  right outside Pittsburgh. It's slammed into the International Airport there. This is massive.
[26:02.400 --> 26:10.080]  We will continue to bring you late breaking news. Jim, how many bodies did you see?
[26:12.400 --> 26:17.200]  You know, I saw four or five, I guess, on the ground that they hauled off early on
[26:18.240 --> 26:23.600]  and over the course of time, I probably saw another eight bodies come out of the building
[26:23.600 --> 26:28.000]  inside of the upper floors. Jumping out of the building? You're being blown out?
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.800]  Some were smoldering and just dropped like faxes for that. So I presume they were dead or
[26:35.360 --> 26:41.760]  out of it. Other ones were flailing. Stay with us for one more quick segment and I want to check
[26:41.760 --> 26:45.280]  in with you throughout the day. We really appreciate you. Gary Brownfield is coming up and then some
[26:45.280 --> 27:01.200]  financial news. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the two aircraft slammed into both the World Trade Center towers.
[27:09.600 --> 27:13.600]  They have collapsed a lot of deaths there on the ground. We should be praying for everyone.
[27:13.600 --> 27:18.880]  We have another plane smashing into the Pentagon. Part of the structure has caved
[27:18.880 --> 27:24.640]  in as being reported. Another one slammed into the Pittsburgh PA airport right outside
[27:24.640 --> 27:31.600]  town, the International Airport. This just in US Canada, Mexico borders have been sealed.
[27:31.600 --> 27:35.680]  That is martial law, ladies and gentlemen. We have three streams now available on the
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.000]  Internet. Record listenership there. Obviously people trying to get the truth and the information.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.720]  And we're on two global courtway frequencies. We're about to go back to Jim Wright, our eyewitness,
[27:44.720 --> 27:49.680]  but then we're going to get to Gary Brownfield and Ted Anderson with the financial news. Everybody
[27:49.680 --> 27:53.760]  bear with us. Let's quickly go to John Stappmiller for an announcement that we're broadcasting to
[27:53.760 --> 27:58.800]  the military right now on an emergency frequency, not just on our AM and FM transmitters. We're
[27:58.800 --> 28:07.440]  on a licensed military transmitter. Go ahead, John. Yeah, Alex. We are going to maintain the 12172
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.480]  for our Genesis audience. We're not going to switch gears. Initially, we thought it might
[28:12.480 --> 28:18.240]  be a good idea to switch for the military from the 12172 standard short way broadcast to the
[28:18.960 --> 28:24.240]  upper single sideband. And for the sake of our listeners, we are not going to do that.
[28:24.240 --> 28:31.040]  David France provided an emergency transmitter on 9.320 on upper single sideband, and he will
[28:31.040 --> 28:35.600]  continue broadcasting on that frequency. John, 30 seconds. You're coming up for two hours after
[28:35.600 --> 28:39.920]  me today at two o'clock central. Your analysis of this, I think we can tell who's behind it.
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.760]  You just heard Jim, who's got a degree in engineering, saying that thing was brought
[28:43.760 --> 28:49.680]  down beautifully with precision. It definitely was. And this is an orchestrated thing. Ironically,
[28:49.680 --> 28:56.160]  they waited until both the House and the Senate was back in session to do this. There is some word,
[28:56.160 --> 29:00.960]  of course, the U.S. financial market that's been closed. The Mexican border is now being
[29:00.960 --> 29:07.840]  spilled off. All of the U.S. air traffic, all the airports around the country are being shut down
[29:07.840 --> 29:14.000]  and evacuated. So this FEMA has, you have not heard anything out of FEMA, but what I have heard,
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.960]  and I need to confirm this, that FEMA had been brought up on alert before the first plane hit
[29:18.960 --> 29:23.600]  the tower in New York City. As usual, the local news is reporting they're evacuating government
[29:23.600 --> 29:27.760]  buildings here in Austin and talking about troops on the streets. I heard that on KLBJ.
[29:27.760 --> 29:31.840]  John, we'll continue to bring people breaking news. Check back in with us in the next two hours.
[29:32.560 --> 29:37.920]  Thank you, John. Thank you, Alex. All right, 9320. Let's go back to Jim Wright. Jim, I appreciate
[29:37.920 --> 29:43.120]  you holding any other key points as an eyewitness there, working at the World Financial Center
[29:43.120 --> 29:48.480]  as it's developed today. Sure, Alex. I mean, to look at the skyline now, it's like a kid
[29:48.480 --> 29:52.640]  padded to teeth pulled out. I mean, it's just the most bizarre thing to see if a New York
[29:52.640 --> 29:58.640]  lower Manhattan skyline without those two towers. Right now, I can tell you a third building that's
[29:58.640 --> 30:04.800]  across the street from the old towers. It's also in the World Trade Complex is on fire. I can,
[30:04.800 --> 30:10.880]  it's about a 50, 60-story building. I can see fire through the windows on about, well, about
[30:10.880 --> 30:16.000]  halfway up the building around the 30th floor. The whole side of the building is smoking on the
[30:16.000 --> 30:19.520]  side of the building. So we now have a 50 to 60-story building on fire as well. Do you know
[30:19.520 --> 30:24.640]  the name of that building? It's one of the World Trade Center buildings. It's probably like five
[30:24.640 --> 30:30.480]  or World Trade Center five or World Trade Center six, something like that. Unbelievable. Will you
[30:30.480 --> 30:34.800]  be available at this number for another update in the next hour? Yeah, it should be, Alex. We'll
[30:34.800 --> 30:40.560]  just get a little five-minute updates from you throughout the day. Jim, Wright, again, any
[30:40.560 --> 30:46.880]  other information that listeners need to know? Just be careful because who knows where this is
[30:46.880 --> 30:57.920]  going to happen next. Yeah, and imagine the pretext for control. You think there'll be a
[30:57.920 --> 31:02.720]  call for us to give up some of our rights for safety? Well, I don't know. I don't know what is
[31:02.720 --> 31:07.600]  all going on right now except, you know, they've shut down the airports. We only have one television,
[31:07.600 --> 31:13.840]  network television station that we can see here, which is up around channel 68. Wait a minute.
[31:13.840 --> 31:17.760]  They've shut down the networks? Well, I think it's because all the antennas were on top of the
[31:17.760 --> 31:25.280]  Trade Center. Oh my goodness. You know, those giant TV antennas. We can only get one network
[31:25.280 --> 31:32.240]  television right now. It's one of the Spanish stations. The NBC affiliate just brought, you can
[31:32.240 --> 31:38.400]  barely in the fuzz, see that they're broadcasting a still kind of a still photo with, you know, no
[31:38.400 --> 31:45.120]  backup. Unbelievable. So there is an eyewitness now a mile and a half away. You see World Trade
[31:45.120 --> 31:49.920]  Center building five or six of 5060 story building on fire as well. That's correct. How much of the
[31:49.920 --> 31:57.040]  building is consumed by flame? Well, you can only see flame coming out the windows about the, I don't
[31:57.040 --> 32:02.400]  know, middle two or three floors, but the entire building top to bottom is obscured in smoke.
[32:02.400 --> 32:08.240]  All right. It looks like, you know, the fire goes all the way up. I don't know if something actually
[32:08.240 --> 32:14.640]  happened that ignited within that building or if that's collateral damage from the from the towers.
[32:14.640 --> 32:21.600]  All right. Jim Wright, right there on the scene. I can confirm I know Jim personally,
[32:21.600 --> 32:26.240]  and we really appreciate Jim giving us that eyewitness report. We'll check back in with you,
[32:26.240 --> 32:30.000]  Jim, and be careful. Okay. Well, I'm dropping off. You want to say out of your family listening
[32:30.000 --> 32:35.120]  in Fredericksburg? Yeah, that and maybe walk down by the water, see if I can help out any,
[32:35.760 --> 32:39.760]  if they need emergency boats or anything. All right. Oh, because you've got your boat there.
[32:39.760 --> 32:45.120]  Yeah. All right, Jim, thank you. Take care, guys. There you have it. And when I tell you that I know
[32:45.120 --> 32:52.640]  Jim, that's just to confirm that I know this individual. They have a summer home in Fredericksburg,
[32:52.640 --> 32:58.800]  and that's been out of their place many times. And there is Jim actually on the scene, an eyewitness
[32:58.800 --> 33:05.280]  we can confirm, and a structural engineer agreed in it, doesn't practice it, watching those buildings
[33:05.280 --> 33:12.240]  collapse with military precision. This is amazing. Let's go to Derry Brownfield, syndicated radio
[33:12.240 --> 33:16.240]  talk show host who will graciously allow myself and others on the air that will have check-ins
[33:16.960 --> 33:20.960]  from Joyce Riley and Dave von Kleist as well as Ted Anderson coming up here in about five minutes.
[33:20.960 --> 33:26.160]  Derry, thank you for holding, sir. You've been covering this stuff for years. You know, I've
[33:26.160 --> 33:31.680]  been on your show predicting this, warning people, I put out press releases on it, that this was
[33:31.680 --> 33:35.520]  going to happen and that a police state would arise. What is your take on all of this, Mr.
[33:35.520 --> 33:41.520]  Brownfield? Well, you know, Alex, believe it or not, it did not shock me very much when all this
[33:41.520 --> 33:47.040]  happened today. And the reason is because in my listeners, if my listeners have heard me say this
[33:47.040 --> 33:52.880]  hundreds of times, I've read the back of the book. We pretty well have an idea of what's going on.
[33:52.880 --> 33:58.880]  We know, in fact, we know what's going on. I have a little interesting information here that I did
[33:58.880 --> 34:03.840]  not have when I was on the air with you earlier, when you were on my show earlier today. But
[34:04.480 --> 34:13.280]  my original plan today was to talk with Charlotte Heiselbert. And I called her, she was on the
[34:13.280 --> 34:17.200]  individuals that didn't know a thing about this until I contacted her and I said, well, we need
[34:17.200 --> 34:23.440]  to change our programming. And she just called back a moment ago and she said that her husband
[34:23.440 --> 34:30.720]  has a friend that a Belgian, a Belgian businessman. And he says that all of Europe is full of the
[34:30.720 --> 34:38.480]  news that two men with Belgian passport entered into Afghanistan and killed Ben Lod two days ago.
[34:39.120 --> 34:43.120]  He says this is all over Europe, but not here in the United States.
[34:43.120 --> 34:51.040]  Have you heard anything about that? Yes, last night on local cable, in fact,
[34:51.040 --> 34:57.120]  I'm going to get that. Greg Erickson, one of my associates, was covering that. And I'm so used to
[34:57.120 --> 35:01.520]  seeing all this. I didn't even cover it last night. We become so, come on from nine to midnight,
[35:01.520 --> 35:06.080]  central would become so conditioned to all of it. In fact, violent, bring me that please.
[35:06.640 --> 35:10.160]  Derry, what do you think about them? Ceiling the Canada and Mexican border
[35:10.160 --> 35:14.560]  and declaring civil emergency, which they've done. They now have it at Threat Con Delta,
[35:14.560 --> 35:18.160]  the highest military readiness. Nuclear warheads have been loaded on the planes.
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.080]  Cruise missiles are loaded into the B-52s. The missiles are activated.
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.280]  The center of government has moved an underground secret installation. They won't tell us where.
[35:27.280 --> 35:33.680]  Bush is airborne right now on Air Force One. They could be nuking somewhere in the Middle East
[35:33.680 --> 35:37.760]  anytime now. What do you see coming up? I have no idea, but you mentioned the
[35:37.760 --> 35:43.040]  borders being closed. And I heard you say earlier on your show that that definitely
[35:43.040 --> 35:49.840]  is martial law. For whatever it were, if this came from Missouri's governor, just no one could go.
[35:50.800 --> 35:55.840]  Governor Holden in Missouri has placed the State National Guard, the State Highway Patrol,
[35:55.840 --> 36:04.240]  and the Capitol Police on Height and Alert. Now, he goes on to say all high-traffic areas
[36:04.240 --> 36:09.200]  in the state have been placed under federal alert. Now, I don't know what that means.
[36:09.760 --> 36:13.920]  I don't know what federal alert. This is under FEMA command. That's what I got on the local news.
[36:13.920 --> 36:18.320]  They're going to have troops out the whole nine yards. I reported last Friday, Derry,
[36:18.320 --> 36:24.480]  that the Austin Police are being trained to drive city buses on pickup routes for citizens. I actually
[36:24.480 --> 36:29.200]  talked to two of the top trainers at Capitol Metro, the bus authority, the transit authority.
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.840]  I also have one of their senior drivers on, and I thought some of them wouldn't come on the air,
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.960]  some did, with the union. They have never seen or heard of anything like this. It's under some
[36:38.960 --> 36:45.440]  emergency directive over and above the union contract. This is some scary stuff, sir. And did
[36:45.440 --> 36:51.200]  you hear Jim Wright, who I know personally. He's a wealthy guy, works for a big bank internationally,
[36:51.200 --> 36:54.320]  got an engineering degree. He worked on the right side of the street today, didn't he?
[36:54.320 --> 36:57.920]  Yeah, he was on the right side of the street today. My point is he's a credible guy.
[36:57.920 --> 37:03.440]  He said those buildings were the most beautiful implosions. He said charges had to be placed
[37:03.440 --> 37:07.440]  on the columns, and Jim doesn't agree with me about this whole new world order.
[37:07.440 --> 37:10.800]  Frankly, Jim is an establishment guy getting pretty rich off of it.
[37:11.360 --> 37:16.320]  You know, I was just handed another news release, Evacuation Nationwide.
[37:17.520 --> 37:21.840]  We're ordered at the United Nations Building in New York, the Sears Tower in Chicago, the
[37:21.840 --> 37:26.720]  tallest skyscrapers in Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Seattle Space Needle.
[37:26.720 --> 37:31.600]  I'm sorry for screaming, everybody. I don't know. Was I on just saying?
[37:31.600 --> 37:35.360]  You were on. They were just telling me that we're going to cease most of our
[37:35.360 --> 37:38.480]  commercials. And if local stations want to air theirs, go ahead.
[37:38.480 --> 37:40.640]  Okay. I was not ignoring you, Darryl. They popped in.
[37:40.640 --> 37:44.160]  Oh, that's fine. No, that's fine. I understand how this business works.
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.720]  But anyway, they've evacuated the U.N. building, the Sears Tower in Chicago, the
[37:50.720 --> 37:54.560]  oldest skyscrapers in Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Seattle Space Needle.
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.440]  In Massachusetts and Maine, most state employees were staying home in state buildings shut down.
[37:59.440 --> 38:04.320]  By the way, the governor in Missouri, and I happened to be in Missouri, they said all state
[38:04.320 --> 38:11.040]  offices would stay open today. In Louisiana, the state police urged petrochemical and pipeline
[38:11.040 --> 38:16.000]  companies to be on the alert. In California, Governor Gray Davis has convened a meeting
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.400]  of the State Emergency Council and requested height security in all state buildings.
[38:20.400 --> 38:26.800]  In Los Angeles, the police went on tactical alert and mobilized an anti-terrorist division.
[38:26.800 --> 38:34.160]  Maybe they'll drive four black APCs from East Germany into a neighborhood and spray 14 houses.
[38:35.280 --> 38:38.320]  That'll save us from the terrorists. This is the point I've been making, Darry.
[38:38.320 --> 38:42.560]  The Chinese military has the Long Beach Naval Base. They have the Panama Canal.
[38:42.560 --> 38:47.760]  Russians were given 12 islands off the coast of Alaska by Clinton. But it's us that are the enemy
[38:47.760 --> 38:53.680]  with grandpa shotgun in the closet. It's moms in minivans. And out of this whole thing,
[38:53.680 --> 38:57.840]  we're going to never, we're seeing the end of America. You're going to see a police state
[38:57.840 --> 39:04.160]  like you've never seen it before after this. And only the global elite stand again from this,
[39:04.160 --> 39:10.080]  regardless of whether Ben Lawton or the Easter Bunny did this. This is so sophisticated,
[39:10.080 --> 39:15.840]  only the CIA or an agency of that power could pull that off. And we've got the British putting
[39:15.840 --> 39:21.520]  out misinformation right now. Darry Brownfield, what is your bottom line analysis? What's your
[39:21.520 --> 39:27.920]  gut level feeling on all of this? Who do you think's behind it? Well, you know, as far as I
[39:27.920 --> 39:33.360]  can't name names and give telephone numbers. But as I mentioned earlier in this show, and I have
[39:33.360 --> 39:38.480]  said it thousands of times on the air, I read the back of the book. And I'm referring here to
[39:38.480 --> 39:43.040]  the Holy Scriptures. I tried to get Hal Lindsey on earlier this morning to see what he thought
[39:43.040 --> 39:48.720]  about it, and I couldn't reach him. But we know that we're going to have one world order,
[39:48.720 --> 39:54.000]  a new world government. We know it's coming. We know the Antichrist is in the wings standing by.
[39:54.000 --> 40:00.560]  Oh, yes. You who he is, I don't know who he is, but he certainly does have the power
[40:00.560 --> 40:06.400]  to clean all this mess up and make it wonderful. So we will have to, and that's going to be his
[40:06.400 --> 40:13.120]  pitch. We're seeing the EU rise as the EU money flows into Europe, Eastern Europe, into Africa
[40:13.120 --> 40:19.280]  as the currency gold back. The dollar began to plunge last week, markets crashing all over
[40:19.280 --> 40:25.520]  the place, and suddenly the center of the world's financial system in New York literally collapses.
[40:26.960 --> 40:35.680]  You see, I was surprised that it was the world trade powers. And that was it. I honestly have
[40:35.680 --> 40:40.800]  expected all of this time for New York to just disappear. And I go back to the scriptures
[40:40.800 --> 40:50.400]  that Babylon shall fall in one day. But maybe he knows Babylon is the Federal Reserve financial
[40:50.400 --> 40:57.840]  system. It is behind it. Yes. Well, the international bankers, yes. Well, Derry, will you stay with us
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.320]  because I want to, speaking of the devil, speaking of the financial system, will you stay right
[41:02.320 --> 41:06.320]  there? I want to bring Ted Anderson up who's got all the news wires there. Right. Can I take about
[41:06.320 --> 41:09.920]  a two minute break? I'm just going to lay the phone down, and I'll be right back.
[41:09.920 --> 41:15.040]  We'll put you on hold and bring you right back up. Let's go to Ted Anderson, owner of Genesis
[41:15.040 --> 41:20.240]  Communications and of Midas Resources, who's put up with me screaming at him all morning.
[41:20.240 --> 41:26.720]  I am very upset about all of this. My testosterone level is flowing just like yours are out there.
[41:26.720 --> 41:31.120]  Ted Anderson, God bless you, sir, for providing this network and a place for people to get accurate
[41:31.120 --> 41:35.360]  information. What's happening financially? Well, obviously, there's a lot of crazy,
[41:35.360 --> 41:40.960]  mixed up emotions going on in all the markets right now. With the World Trade Center, that is
[41:40.960 --> 41:46.080]  where gold and silver trades in the United States. It's the largest market for gold and silver, grains.
[41:46.880 --> 41:51.440]  Anything that you see, if you ever want to watch, if you know anything about the futures market,
[41:51.440 --> 41:56.480]  that's where the futures market used to happen. Obviously, it's now closed, and it says that it
[41:56.480 --> 42:01.680]  will close, will not open until further notice is what it says on the thing. The London gold market
[42:01.680 --> 42:06.320]  is going up. There's a lot of things that are happening right now. The silver market is right
[42:06.320 --> 42:13.680]  now at 432. It seems rather calm, but it's a big crapshoot right now. There's a lot of people
[42:13.680 --> 42:17.680]  that are very concerned, of course, what are the paper markets and how are they going to react to
[42:17.680 --> 42:21.920]  this particular... And we know that those are the most speculative markets. Some of them leverage
[42:21.920 --> 42:30.400]  not 20 to 1, but 100, 150 to 1. This is pandemic. Ted Anderson, any other financial information?
[42:30.400 --> 42:34.640]  Well, yeah. As a matter of fact, to give you a little bit of a brief update on what's going on
[42:34.640 --> 42:39.520]  in the precious metals market, because that's where I am. That's what we do here at Midas Resources.
[42:39.520 --> 42:43.600]  Most of my suppliers have shut down, and they said, we can't sell you right now. We've sold
[42:43.600 --> 42:47.280]  everything out, and we don't know where the markets are going to open up at. We've got a
[42:47.280 --> 42:51.600]  few suppliers that are still open, but it's very amazing to me to watch this happen. I've never
[42:51.600 --> 42:56.480]  experienced this in the 23 years now that I've been in the business where the markets have actually
[42:56.480 --> 43:02.400]  been shut down like this and won't open up until further notice. And the borders are now sealed
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.760]  troops, federal troops, for taking control of downtown cities under security arrangements?
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.160]  Well, obviously, Alex, a major concern right now is for the people that are sitting there in the
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.720]  paper wondering what's going to happen. They've got their life savings tied up, and here you have
[43:16.720 --> 43:21.920]  chaos, and hopefully the markets stay stable, and they can get out with reasonable cost.
[43:21.920 --> 43:25.200]  Yeah, I'm told that there are already giant lines forming at the banks.
[43:25.200 --> 43:29.360]  Well, there's a bit of a stampede going on here at Mitus Resources, and if you've been calling
[43:29.360 --> 43:32.640]  in on the 800 number, please be patient. We've got a lot of people working them,
[43:33.600 --> 43:38.240]  but you will be taken care of. There's a lot of people that are looking to have gold right now
[43:38.240 --> 43:41.920]  with the markets shut down. Obviously, in the United States, it's going to be much tougher to
[43:41.920 --> 43:51.680]  buy the stuff. Not every option is open to you anymore, so if you are calling in, do that.
[43:51.680 --> 43:58.240]  Just be patient. Well, the EU is rolling out with a 15 to 30% gold back currency,
[43:58.880 --> 44:04.960]  and we have a fiat paper currency here, and the reason we can still buy cheap goods is because
[44:04.960 --> 44:10.160]  that dollar was the World Reserve currency. Well, the fiat currency of choice, now it is
[44:10.160 --> 44:16.160]  imploding. Ted, watching the World Trade Center's collide, what was it like for you? Was it surreal
[44:16.160 --> 44:21.360]  for you as it was for me to watch them implode like that? Oh, I tell you what, it wasn't a
[44:21.360 --> 44:27.360]  whole lot different looking than watching a building that's been demolitioned, where they
[44:27.360 --> 44:31.120]  blow them up and they implode. That's what the engineer just said on the show. Yeah, the only
[44:31.120 --> 44:34.480]  difference I can see with this one is this one looked more like it was peeling apart like a
[44:34.480 --> 44:39.440]  banana. I'd like to see the damage that happened to the buildings that are surrounding it. My
[44:39.440 --> 44:46.560]  heart goes out to all the victims. It just makes me sick. It really does, and it's hard for me
[44:46.560 --> 44:51.360]  to comprehend because I'm so far away. We have Chris Markowski who had called in a little earlier.
[44:51.360 --> 44:57.040]  Ted, hold on one second. We are about to break. We're not running our ads. We're not going into
[44:57.040 --> 45:00.560]  this particular ad here, so just keep right on going. Yeah, just to let the stations know if
[45:00.560 --> 45:04.800]  you want to break, go ahead. I don't think you probably would want to. Nobody else is. Ted,
[45:05.520 --> 45:09.040]  we're going to get Chris Markowski, who was right across the river from it, back on. We're
[45:09.040 --> 45:13.280]  going to have Jim Wright, who was in the building next door and got out a family friend of mine.
[45:13.280 --> 45:17.360]  We're going to have others checking in. It's good to know that we're on an emergency military
[45:17.360 --> 45:24.080]  channel at 9320 right now, broadcasting to the troops. Ted, you know I've been predicting this,
[45:24.080 --> 45:28.160]  haven't I? Yeah, you sure I've been talking about it quite a bit, and there's no question about it
[45:28.160 --> 45:33.200]  in my mind right now. Whoever blew up the Trade Center, I don't know, but I know one thing for
[45:33.200 --> 45:39.120]  sure. It's just like the Oklahoma City bombing or when the kids were shot in the schools out there.
[45:39.120 --> 45:44.720]  There's always legislation to take away more American freedoms. Now folks, think about that
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.200]  before you start supporting the effort. We do need to support our troops. Somebody is going
[45:49.200 --> 45:55.440]  to have to defend this nation, but let's keep a close eye on the new world. Yeah, we're now
[45:55.440 --> 46:02.240]  getting information that it looks like that plane that was blown up at the airport outside Pittsburgh
[46:02.240 --> 46:08.240]  may have had terrorists on board and that it was taken out. We know F-16s are all flying around.
[46:08.240 --> 46:13.840]  We've got F-16s flying around above Austin right now to shoot down any planes. This is
[46:13.840 --> 46:20.160]  pandemic. And again, the Pentagon was attacked. The Pentagon on fire. Now a World Trade Center
[46:20.160 --> 46:26.320]  building, one of the sub buildings, a 50 to 60 story building. Our eyewitnesses report is on fire,
[46:26.320 --> 46:30.880]  ladies and gentlemen. And it doesn't Peter Jennings look like this is all rehearsed. Well,
[46:30.880 --> 46:35.680]  they did rehearse this just a few months ago, according to the Associated Press. And I have
[46:35.680 --> 46:42.240]  the script from Fox News, excuse me, from Fox Television from the Lone Gunman TV show about
[46:42.240 --> 46:46.880]  four months ago. The only Lone Gunman I ever watched. I told Violet, go to Fox's website,
[46:46.880 --> 46:52.560]  see if they have it. Now Lone Gunman had a story where a secret government body had remote control
[46:52.560 --> 46:59.440]  747s and we're trying to crash them, ladies and gentlemen. This is unbelievable into the
[46:59.440 --> 47:05.120]  World Trade Center. Talk about throwing it in your face. The script of that show is posted
[47:05.120 --> 47:12.880]  on info wars.com. Now with the World Trade Center bombing in 93 repeat October 28 93
[47:13.520 --> 47:18.160]  article in the New York Times admitted the feds trained the drivers, built the bomb and
[47:18.160 --> 47:23.760]  let the bombing go forward. Mr. Salam recorded the FBI chief telling him to do it with FEMA.
[47:24.320 --> 47:29.760]  I mean, we have got the smoking gun on this one. Whether they use Islamic terrorists, no telling.
[47:29.760 --> 47:36.240]  This is from MSNBC breaking news. Bin Laden comes home to roost. His CIA ties are only the beginning
[47:36.240 --> 47:46.160]  of a woeful story. CIA. He was the CIA darling. His family sits on iridium satellite board.
[47:46.160 --> 47:52.240]  Osama Bin Laden is a minion of the new world order. His family builds all of the military bases
[47:52.240 --> 48:00.880]  in Saudi Arabia to this day gets the contracts. He is a CIA boy and here is MSNBC, New York.
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.560]  At the CIA, it happens often enough to have a code name blowback simply defined. This is the
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.440]  term that describes an agent, an operative or an operation that is turned on its creators.
[48:11.440 --> 48:17.200]  Osama Bin Laden, our new public enemy number one is the personification of blowback and the fact
[48:17.200 --> 48:22.160]  that it is viewed as a hero by millions of Islamic world leaders proves again the old image
[48:22.160 --> 48:30.480]  and the old adage. You reap what you sow. Here is MSNBC posted. Bin Laden is a CIA asset. Ted,
[48:30.480 --> 48:36.640]  any comments on that? Well, it just drives me crazy with the stuff that I see in Poland,
[48:36.640 --> 48:43.280]  this country. Nothing surprises me anymore, Alex. The thing about this is I hate speculating.
[48:43.280 --> 48:47.920]  I like to see a little bit more evidence before I can step forward and say I think this is the
[48:47.920 --> 48:52.720]  place that's doing it. The thing that really concerns me whether, like I say, whether if this
[48:52.720 --> 48:58.240]  is a terrorist attack from some other country and whether it's orchestrated by our government or not,
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.520]  the thing about it is the results are the same. We've got to watch for the results. Who stands
[49:03.520 --> 49:09.520]  to gain? Who has the motive? Who has been telling us that this is going to happen? Give up our right?
[49:09.520 --> 49:15.200]  Who is training the police to drive buses on citizen pickups confirmed with bus company
[49:15.200 --> 49:20.160]  employees on last Friday night's show that I did? Who is building FEMA camps and who has been
[49:20.160 --> 49:24.960]  making the prediction I have that all of this would happen? I'm not saying George Bush even
[49:24.960 --> 49:29.760]  knows what's happening. I'm not saying the senators are behind it. I'm saying the intelligence
[49:29.760 --> 49:35.600]  agencies create these monsters and they let the monsters bomb the World Trade Center in 93.
[49:35.600 --> 49:40.960]  That is not speculation. That was in the New York Times and I've made a film. I've had
[49:40.960 --> 49:45.760]  General Parton on this show. I've had countless others, police detectives who will tell you
[49:45.760 --> 49:50.720]  Oklahoma City was a government bombing. Now I'm asking the people out there, if they knew
[49:50.720 --> 49:56.160]  Iraq or they knew Pakistan or they knew Afghanistan, you're going to have this incredible
[49:56.160 --> 50:00.960]  nationalistic fervor and it's going to sweep everybody into it. Anybody that doesn't go
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.600]  along with it is going to be an enemy. Let me say now, I support this government. I support
[50:05.600 --> 50:11.360]  whoever they knew. I support FEMA camps. I support the takeover. How's that? I can be on ABC Nightly
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.720]  News now, Ted. Well, Alex, now just using that as a partner. I just had one of the guys step in
[50:16.720 --> 50:19.920]  and there's a lot of people that are calling in that are concerned about the markets and what's
[50:19.920 --> 50:26.480]  going on. We will be keeping you posted at mitusresources.com. If you do have some questions
[50:26.480 --> 50:30.160]  about it and what's going on and when the markets are going to be open and how your portfolio could
[50:30.160 --> 50:34.960]  be doing and how is this affecting it, you can call our representatives if you'd like.
[50:34.960 --> 50:42.880]  If you don't have to do any transactions, that's not what this is about, but you can call 1-800-686-2237.
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.960]  That's 1-800-686-2237. We'll keep you posted and what's going on. Alex, I got a lot of things
[50:48.960 --> 50:53.520]  that I've got to cover. You're doing a great job. Hopefully, we can find a few more experts,
[50:53.520 --> 50:56.880]  a few more people that are in the field that are looking at it and get them up here and let's get
[50:56.880 --> 51:03.520]  some explanation. All right, Ted Anderson, thank you. Ted has been in, he's all registered with
[51:03.520 --> 51:07.760]  every stock thing you can imagine in gold and financial news is really what he covers. I'm
[51:07.760 --> 51:13.680]  tuned into the Mitus Report from 4-5 Central today. We've got Derry Brownfield on the line. Derry,
[51:13.680 --> 51:18.560]  I appreciate you holding. He is the host of one of the longest running talk shows in the country.
[51:18.560 --> 51:22.400]  How long have you been broadcasting on the radio, Derry? Well, I go back to broadcasting all the
[51:22.400 --> 51:27.920]  way back to the early 1960s. Have you ever seen anything this big or this bizarre since World War
[51:27.920 --> 51:34.080]  II? Well, no, of course not. No one else has either. But as I mentioned earlier on your show,
[51:34.080 --> 51:39.360]  for those that are just now tuning in, perhaps, this really did not shock me. Now, when the
[51:39.360 --> 51:43.600]  first airplane we watched here on television is just as I was coming into work this morning,
[51:44.400 --> 51:49.440]  when the first airplane hit the trade center, an airplane hit the trade center. When the second
[51:49.440 --> 51:55.760]  one did, I knew immediately what had taken place. Well, absolutely. I would tell everybody,
[51:55.760 --> 52:00.160]  make sure you've got your cars full of gas. Make sure you've got plenty of food,
[52:00.160 --> 52:04.800]  those water filters. If the martial law stuff starts cranking up, I'm going to go over to my
[52:04.800 --> 52:08.960]  parents' house, grab my dad around the scrub of the neck and say, you're leaving the country and
[52:08.960 --> 52:14.320]  you're taking my little sister out of here now who's 16 years younger than me and who's in high
[52:14.320 --> 52:20.160]  school. You're getting out of here and you're leaving now. You're going to Costa Rica now and
[52:20.160 --> 52:24.080]  I'm going to stay here and I'm going to fight for this country, for the United States against
[52:24.080 --> 52:30.080]  Arab, Paris or anybody else. Gary Brownfield, will you stay with us? You bet I will. All right,
[52:30.080 --> 52:35.920]  infowars.com for all the updates and all the news. The pilot's got 50 articles posted,
[52:35.920 --> 52:40.080]  the newest analysis, and everything's shutting down. The boarders, you name it,
[52:40.080 --> 52:45.120]  martial law is here and we're not going to let them get away with it. We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[52:45.120 --> 52:54.320]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[52:54.320 --> 52:59.040]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state. Here's just a
[52:59.040 --> 53:08.720]  sample. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[53:08.720 --> 53:17.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[53:18.480 --> 53:25.760]  It's just like Ted Anderson said in the last break. No matter who did this, some filthy Arab
[53:25.760 --> 53:30.800]  terrorist, part of it's part of this world government that founded the CIA and the NSA and
[53:30.800 --> 53:36.000]  the rest of it. Read your history bugs. Don't let them give you a police state out of it. We
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.320]  have the power, the American people, to all police agencies and military. I know that 75% of the
[53:42.320 --> 53:48.160]  military is awake to what's happening. About half the cops are. We need to pray for the people that
[53:48.160 --> 53:54.000]  have died. Our hearts go out to their families and I would just pray here on the air, Lord,
[53:54.000 --> 53:59.520]  heal our land. We seek your face. We want this land to be healed. We don't want to be part
[53:59.520 --> 54:05.120]  of an evil system. We want our country to be brought back to its former decency and please,
[54:05.120 --> 54:09.600]  God, we pray that no biological attacks are engaged in as the government has been predicting
[54:09.600 --> 54:15.120]  what happened in Fox and ABC in the last month that I've read where they talk about one to four
[54:15.120 --> 54:21.360]  million dead and the fake and nightline newscast they did last year where they talked about 50,000
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.720]  dead and martial law. They've been talking so much about this, Lord, as you know, please heal
[54:26.720 --> 54:33.280]  this land. Please put a protective hedge up against America. We are so sorry for the abortion and
[54:33.280 --> 54:38.000]  the infanticide and the support of China and giving them the Olympic games when they kill
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.800]  political dissidents and sell their organs. We're so sorry that George Bush came back from Russia
[54:42.800 --> 54:47.200]  two months ago and said he looked into Vladimir Putin's eyes and saw a man with a soul he could
[54:47.200 --> 54:52.880]  trust and a man of love when Vladimir Putin has press conferences taking 30,000 slaves from North
[54:52.880 --> 55:00.640]  Korea in the BBC for payment for a $5 billion debt. We didn't do that, Lord. We're fighting it as
[55:00.640 --> 55:04.320]  hard as we can. Please protect the good people of this country. Amen.
[55:05.600 --> 55:11.040]  Gary Brownfield, would you agree with that? Well, yes, I will. But let me say this, and I mentioned
[55:11.040 --> 55:16.960]  this on my own show today. It's difficult for me, Alex, to pray for America anymore. Now,
[55:16.960 --> 55:22.800]  that sounds unfatriotic and I can pray for God's people. That's a totally different group of people.
[55:22.800 --> 55:28.720]  I'm not sure we have too many of God's people left in this country, but it's difficult for me to see
[55:28.720 --> 55:34.960]  that God could ever bless America when our own school children in the government schools
[55:34.960 --> 55:39.440]  are not allowed to stand up and sing, God bless America, then how can he do it?
[55:41.280 --> 55:47.200]  Again, we have three planes, four planes confirmed slamming into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, slamming
[55:47.200 --> 55:52.080]  into the Pentagon, of course, two slamming into the World Trade Center buildings that collapsed
[55:52.080 --> 55:57.920]  about an hour after 45 minutes after they were hit. I have a news release here that
[55:57.920 --> 56:03.440]  we might share with our listeners, Alex. Okay, please. FEMA has now responded to the terrorism
[56:03.440 --> 56:09.200]  attack. FEMA is now working closely with the White House and other federal agencies to provide
[56:09.200 --> 56:16.160]  assistance following several apparent terrorism attacks. That's almost the understatement of
[56:16.160 --> 56:22.960]  the day, isn't it? Yes. High-level meetings between senior officials in all federal agencies
[56:22.960 --> 56:30.800]  and the vice president and Condozella Rice are underway. FEMA has activated its operation center.
[56:31.360 --> 56:36.400]  All federal agencies play a role to respond to the effects of these attacks as part of the federal
[56:36.400 --> 56:44.000]  response plan, and FEMA will coordinate these efforts on behalf of President Bush. So far,
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.480]  we have not heard from President Bush, have we? No, he's on board Air Force One.
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.040]  Well, but he can talk. He's got his phone. That Air Force One has a cell phone in it.
[56:53.040 --> 56:56.800]  It actually has a satellite uplink sticking off the bottom. I know that. But what I'm saying is
[56:56.800 --> 57:03.200]  he could have... He can broadcast nationwide on TV from Air Force One. You know, let's go back
[57:03.200 --> 57:10.640]  another year or two. I was one of the people back a year and a half ago, whenever Y2K was,
[57:10.640 --> 57:17.520]  you know, at the turn of the century, that believed that this was going to be, and I honestly thought,
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.800]  in a deep in my heart, that we were going to see something of this nature happen
[57:24.960 --> 57:28.320]  at the turn of the century, maybe even on New Year's Eve.
[57:28.320 --> 57:33.600]  But that was just a pretext for them to put in their FEMA bunkers, their FEMA command centers.
[57:33.600 --> 57:38.480]  That's absolutely right. Y2K was the cover for them to put in the military control grid.
[57:38.480 --> 57:43.360]  Why didn't they go ahead and do it that night? Because the world was ready for it.
[57:43.360 --> 57:49.520]  Also, Vladimir Putin had just taken power. Yeltsin had disappeared. A lot of power jockeying was going on.
[57:51.920 --> 57:58.000]  But I still believe that this is the plan that they had for Y2K.
[58:00.080 --> 58:06.560]  Russian troops. And then the two media moguls got arrested and the TV station radio network got
[58:06.560 --> 58:15.520]  taken over by Ted Turner. Are they going to try to silence Alex Jones?
[58:16.560 --> 58:22.240]  Well, I know this. Ted Turner, they arrested the media heads in Russia, the two private groups,
[58:22.240 --> 58:28.000]  and Ted Turner took over. So, see, Jane Fonda does. No, no, they're not going to be able to do that here.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.600]  I mean, I walked into a grocery store this morning while it was going on to grab something,
[58:31.600 --> 58:35.120]  brought down the street, everybody's going, Alex, Alex, it's the government. It's the government.
[58:35.120 --> 58:39.760]  I have like 20 people around me, so they can't get away with it. There's too many people.
[58:39.760 --> 58:44.160]  There's too many networks. There's too much force out there. Most people in government don't even know
[58:44.800 --> 58:48.640]  what's behind this. We don't know if the government did it. We don't know if they provocative.
[58:48.640 --> 58:54.880]  It may be Bin Laden's crowd, but bottom line, we know Bin Laden was a CIA asset, MSNBC,
[58:54.880 --> 59:01.760]  oninfowars.com. Bin Laden comes home to Russia. CIA ties are only the beginning of the story.
[59:01.760 --> 59:07.440]  MSNBC posted. That's not Alex Jones. Are they going to shut down MSNBC? So,
[59:07.440 --> 59:10.960]  we gave him stinger missiles. We gave him weapons. We gave him bombs.
[59:10.960 --> 59:17.600]  It may just be Bin Laden. We don't know, Derry. Now, I mentioned this earlier on your show,
[59:17.600 --> 59:21.600]  but I have some information here that they say the news is all over Europe,
[59:22.240 --> 59:27.280]  but not here in the United States that some Afghanistanians killed Bin Laden a couple of days ago.
[59:27.280 --> 59:31.280]  Yeah, that's being reported by the BBC.
[59:33.760 --> 59:36.800]  Derry, what do you think we should all do during this situation? What should families
[59:36.800 --> 59:40.720]  be doing right now? Well, I'd say a lot of this depends, of course,
[59:40.720 --> 59:47.040]  of the first thing you're going to do is ask for some divine guidance. But I think a lot
[59:47.040 --> 59:51.920]  of it depends upon where you are. I'm just glad that I live out in the sticks and the hills and
[59:51.920 --> 59:59.040]  the hollers, and I'm not in New York City. You're in Austin, Texas. That's not as bad as New York
[59:59.040 --> 1:00:04.480]  City, but it's not as good as Sandy Hook, Missouri. Let me tell you something. Two months ago,
[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:09.120]  they sealed Fort Hood. It's bigger than Dallas and Fort Worth, put together north of Austin.
[1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:15.040]  They got Newt bases, underground facilities there. They sealed Fort Hood. They sealed Fort
[1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:21.280]  Knox. They sealed 100 other military bases. Here in Missouri, and I don't have the story,
[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:27.440]  but I heard one of our newscasters make the comment that you see Fort Leonard Wood is in
[1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:34.240]  Missouri, and one of our newscasters made the comment that everybody was under what Jeff just
[1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:38.800]  walked in. Do you remember what they said, Jeff, about the ID at Fort Leonard Wood?
[1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:42.960]  You can bring Jeff up if you'd like. What's going on?
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:47.280]  100% ID verification. Okay, go ahead.
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:52.560]  A new process put in. In other words, you used to could just drive right through the base.
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:56.640]  Anybody that wanted to could go any player on the base just like you were in another town.
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:00.080]  That's all stopped, and that stopped a couple of weeks ago.
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:07.600]  Yes, and then we find out Friday that the city of Austin Police are trying to drive the buses on
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:11.920]  routes to people's homes. Mr. Brownfield, how does that factor in?
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:17.600]  Well, that looks like the gun collection, doesn't it?
[1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:21.280]  Certainly does. I don't know. I don't know. What people would they pick up?
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:25.600]  They're not telling us. We haven't confirmed. I mean, I had the bus people on the air.
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:30.720]  What did the bus people say? The union is just hopping nabble. They say it's a violation of
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:36.000]  every contract and that they're telling them that the police don't even need a commercial vehicle
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:41.600]  or large vehicle operators license. They're giving them just emergency training to drive
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:45.120]  city buses on routes and teaching them the routes around Central Texas.
[1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:50.400]  OK, here's a couple of other news releases. American Airlines reports it's lost two aircraft.
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:57.920]  American Flight 11, Boeing 767, flying from Boston to LA. Had 81 passengers and 11 crew aboard.
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:03.280]  Flight 77, a Boeing 757, and read from Washington's Dulles Airport to Los Angeles,
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:09.920]  had 58 passengers and six crew members aboard. 11.16 a.m. this morning CNN reported that the
[1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:15.520]  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing bioterrorism themes to respond to the
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:22.960]  incident in a precautionary move that preparation is not based on any known bioterrorism threat.
[1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:27.840]  Here's another one. FEMA is working closely with the White House and other federal agencies
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:32.800]  to provide assistance following several apparent terrorism attacks today. High-level meetings
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:37.360]  between... Well, I mentioned that earlier. FEMA has activated its operation center.
[1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:40.880]  And that's about all I have just at this moment.
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:45.920]  All right. Jerry Brownfield, will you call back in or can we call you in about another 20 or 30
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:51.280]  minutes to get more updates from you? OK, then I'm going to have to leave within the next hour.
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:55.040]  I'll have to leave. I have another meeting I have to attend.
[1:02:55.040 --> 1:02:58.560]  We'll check in with you in about 20 minutes. OK, good enough. God bless you, sir.
[1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:06.880]  All right, let's go ahead and bring Ted Anderson, owner of Genesis Broadcasting, back up on the
[1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:14.240]  air. And then we will start going to some calls. If you'd like to join us on air with your comments,
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:17.440]  your take, what you've seen on the news. I'm sitting there watching the news this morning
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:21.280]  and they report it's a government plane that smashed into it. I mean, go telling what's going
[1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:30.000]  on out there. Your eyes and ears, 1-800-686-2237. Just thought of that, Alex, just a real quick
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:35.920]  update. I did have a customer that was looking to wire some funds and it's hard to tell what's
[1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:41.920]  going on out there, but asked their bank to wire funds over to the account here and the bank said
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:46.640]  that they had suspended all wire transactions. So that's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing big
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:52.880]  lines at the bank, too. Yeah, I think they're probably trying to avoid a bank run. With fractional
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:57.040]  reserve banking, there's only about 6% of the money that's actually on deposit. It won't take
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:00.720]  too many people to show up at the door to try to draw it out. And if you're transferring money out
[1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:08.320]  of accounts, of course, that greatly affects it as well. So financially, the powers that be,
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:13.680]  which are not the government, but the private institutions that run the financial system here
[1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:20.640]  are right now taking precautions to try to stop a run from happening. Just a quick understanding
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:26.880]  is that people go in, they make deposits, the banks lend them out. They keep about 6% on hand
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:30.720]  for anybody who wants to take money out. Yeah, 90 plus percent of it's all digital. The money
[1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:35.680]  doesn't even exist in cash form. I frankly don't even hardly want to talk about this because it
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:40.160]  could cause something, but we have to. We have to bring people the news and information. Ted,
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:46.560]  this gets scarier and scarier by the minute. Well, and the thing about it is perhaps we've
[1:04:46.560 --> 1:04:51.040]  been very speculative here in this country and we've been living on the edge for quite some time
[1:04:51.040 --> 1:04:55.120]  and we've always expected that we'd always be safe and nothing could ever happen on our borders.
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:05:00.880]  But obviously things can happen on our borders. So a bit of caution out there. I just want to
[1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:06.000]  let people know. And the borders are shut down right now. Yeah, it's, you know, travel is going
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:12.640]  to be, I've heard a lot of things and I like to confirm what's going on. But I've heard that there
[1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:17.680]  are checkpoints being set up. I've heard that there's limitations on various different things.
[1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:21.120]  But one of the major concerns to me is that this is something that
[1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:25.360]  financially could affect every listener out there. Yeah, setting checkpoints up in rural America.
[1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:29.200]  That'll stop the Islamic terrorist. Yeah. Well, anyways, Alex, I just thought I'd give a quick
[1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:32.960]  update on that. I'll try to keep an eye on the financial markets and let you know what's going
[1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:39.200]  on. Ted, thank you so much. We're going to check back in a little bit later with Jim Wright,
[1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:43.760]  one of my good friends who lives out in Fredericksburg, Texas, but half the year lives in New
[1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:50.880]  York and worked at the World Financial Center next door and actually saw the, well, the first
[1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:55.440]  plane slammed in. They felt that they were outside and saw the second one hit at about the 75th
[1:05:55.440 --> 1:06:02.240]  floor as the building exploded, caught fire and then collapsed 45 minutes later. The Pentagon
[1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:09.200]  has had a large fixed wing aircraft crashed into it, also outside of Pittsburgh, PA. The airport
[1:06:09.200 --> 1:06:16.240]  was hit by a plane, may have been shot down by F-16s or other fighter jets. The borders have been
[1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:20.880]  sealed and they're basically declaring civil emergency all over the country and federal
[1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:25.920]  troops are making their way into your capitals of your states. I thought they'd use foot and
[1:06:25.920 --> 1:06:30.240]  mouth to get this done. They passed a martial law provision. That's not rumor. That's the fact
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:34.960]  on my website, the foot and mouth section. They said if foot and mouth was released, people would
[1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:39.600]  have to stay indoors and the army would bring you food. Yeah, right. Logistically, they could do that.
[1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:44.320]  And notice they've cut our military back to nothing and then small portions of it have
[1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:50.160]  been left as security agencies to everybody in government, speak the truth, stand up to what's
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:55.360]  happening, find out who's responsible and make them pay. Frankly, we probably never will find
[1:06:55.360 --> 1:07:00.640]  out who's responsible, but talking to Jim Wright, who's not just a big financial guru. He's also,
[1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:05.600]  as an engineering degree, that building was brought down with shape charges, precision,
[1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:10.160]  collapsing. At the top, some of it peeled off and then suddenly the whole thing just collapsed
[1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:17.120]  top down. And then the other one collapsed top down in about 5 to 10 seconds. That just doesn't
[1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:25.440]  happen. This just gets more and more bizarre by the minute we are living history right now.
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:30.240]  And I am honored to be your host. I'm so thankful for Genesis and Liberty Works and all of our
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:39.520]  other AM and FM affiliates across the country, WWFV, Global Shortwave, at 12.172 and 9320
[1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:43.360]  emergency frequency to all the military out there in upper single sign band. And of course,
[1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:48.800]  m2ktalk.com, we've just tripled our record listenership here as people are hungry for
[1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:54.800]  the truth and the accuracy in what's developing. And I'm engaging in a lot less speculation
[1:07:54.800 --> 1:08:00.720]  than the mainstream media. But here I am reading an NBC news story. Ben Laden comes home to Roost.
[1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:06.080]  His CI ties are only the beginning of a woeful story. You reap what you sow.
[1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:12.000]  Why is his family on the board of Iridium Satellite? Why do they get the contracts
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.480]  after bombings to rebuild the buildings in Saudi Arabia supposedly bombed by
[1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:21.760]  the wicked son of Ben Laden? Why was he given stinger missiles?
[1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:26.720]  I mean, are they going to tell us like TWA, Flight 800? They don't know who did this.
[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:33.680]  And then we just sit here and no one pays for it. And we get more and more surveillance society.
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:37.280]  You know, there were hearings coming up in a couple of weeks about the surveillance society
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:44.400]  we reported yesterday. What's going to happen now with that? Violet is perpetually updating
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:52.480]  infowars.com with all the latest developments. They had a lone gunman show on Fox,
[1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:57.360]  their ex file show, variant show four months ago that I saw on a Sunday night.
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:06.320]  And it actually showed the government, a secret group in the government controlling
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:12.560]  the planes by remote control and trying to crash a huge jumbo jet into the side of the
[1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:19.200]  World Trade Center. You see, let's say Ben Laden did this or let's say the Easter Bunny did it.
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:22.560]  Or, you know, the moon, you know, the men from the moon, whoever did it.
[1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:32.800]  This horrible tragedy. Whoever engaged in this. Why does the media continually hype terrorism?
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:41.200]  Why do they continually promote all of this? Why are they continually peddling this and
[1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:46.000]  telling the world how vulnerable we are in the newspapers and how we're wide open?
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:52.160]  The old rule on terrorism is don't give terrorist attention. Don't talk about your weak points.
[1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:59.200]  Don't talk about the main targets. That's all we see in the newswires every day. Inviting Arab
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:05.200]  terrorists to attack. Inviting communist terrorists to attack. And what did Bill Clinton do before he
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:11.680]  left office? He released 16 members of the FALN convicted of 130 mass bombings of police
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:17.920]  and military installations and FBI offices, killing dozens, injuring thousands.
[1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:27.200]  No fanfare. Just release them. Release them. Release known bombing masterminds. They didn't
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:31.120]  hype those bombings up in the 70s and 80s when they did them. They ignored them like you're
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:40.880]  supposed to. Ben Clinton releases them. Think about that. Think about that long and hard.
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:49.360]  Who stands to gain from all of this? Now, I know we skipped the break and I have some developing
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:54.640]  news here in front of me. Let's go to about two minutes of renegades and I'm going to read over
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:58.480]  some of this newest developments and we're going to come back and go straight to your calls.
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:09.040]  If you would like to join us online, toll-free number to do so, 1-800-259-9231. I actually gave
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:15.040]  the minus number out because I'm just so flustered. We will continue to cover this. President Bush
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:21.360]  spoke briefly earlier today addressing people on education. Looks like he's going to be addressing
[1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:24.320]  the nation here pretty soon. We'll see if we're going to cover that. I'm sure our stations will
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:34.640]  break away and cover Bush bringing the country together up there, keeping us safe. All right,
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:39.760]  though. I'll be back in two minutes and we will go straight to your calls. This is Genesis Broadcasting
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:12:05.760]  Worldwide, the 11th of September, 2001, smack dab in the middle of the New World Order takeover.
[1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:19.760]  Some would make him change, others couldn't stand for that. The cross was a pollution,
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:32.560]  but it rose again. Wise men follow him, but it rose again. Wise men follow him,
[1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:47.360]  so thank God for the renegade, let the lightning lead for the hell's sake. Without the renegade,
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:13:03.360]  the Lord knows where we'd be when it comes to heroes renegade your mind.
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:17.840]  They railed against the crowd, another red-tag bet, declaring independence.
[1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:30.640]  They divided down on a bloody war, a liberty for their descendants.
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:42.640]  Thanks for the renegade, for free today. Thanks to the renegade, for free today.
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:58.640]  Thanks God for the renegade, let the lightning lead for the hell's sake. Without the renegade,
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:14.640]  the Lord knows where we'd be when it comes to heroes renegade your mind.
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:40.640]  Where's the renegade, in the world today? Who are the renegades, in the world today?
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:49.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, back live. As you know, the Pentagon was a kamikaze
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:56.240]  attacked by a large airliner of some type. The World Trade Center, both towers have collapsed,
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:02.720]  hit by two planes this morning. Another plane crashed the International Airport outside of
[1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:08.560]  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We're about to go to your calls a little bit later. Check in with Jim
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:15.200]  right there on the ground in New York. He was in the building right next door, one of my good
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:19.440]  friends. We can vouch for everything he says here on the air. People jumping out of the buildings,
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:28.960]  burning, smoking bodies falling out. Top news, ladies and gentlemen, I just saw McCain on CBS
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:35.520]  saying that we are going to have to change the way we live our lives and give up a bunch of our
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:41.920]  rights for security and that things will never go back to the way they were. And he's out there
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:48.880]  peddling it. They have the feds taking over central areas of downtown cities and capitals confirmed.
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:55.600]  This is the New World Order. And look for them the next few weeks to say we need to turn in our
[1:15:55.600 --> 1:16:01.680]  guns so the terrorists don't blow up buildings. It'll be something along those lines. Regardless
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:08.160]  of who did this, only big brother stands to gain. And repeat, John McCain, not a question of if,
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:12.080]  but when this was going to happen. We've got to change the way we live our lives and give up our
[1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:17.600]  rights. And police will feel just fine searching your car at the checkpoints in your papers and
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:23.200]  your digital thumb scan, your face scan, because we've got to keep America safe. So we could be
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:28.400]  watching the death of America because of this terrorist bombing, giving into the terrorism,
[1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:33.600]  giving you and your family a nightmarish police state. We're not going to back down globalist.
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:38.320]  I understand that we're going to find out who did this and we're going to expose you. That's why
[1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:43.280]  Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center being government events were so important. That's why
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:50.320]  James Bamford, best selling author, 2020 executive, the Baltimore Sun story on info wars.com.
[1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:56.320]  The feds wanted to blow up airliners bomb buildings as a pretext to invade Cuba in 62. Kennedy said,
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:04.400]  no, that's why all that's why I cover that so much on this show and have courage, have honor.
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:08.080]  Oh, that most people in government are good and decent, but they're going to be blinded by this
[1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:12.480]  and get into an absolute frenzy. The good news is they don't have the infrastructure for anything
[1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:18.000]  massive. Thank God we do have the infrastructure that is against the people to stop any planes to
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.560]  shut them down. But now they're, now they're clamping down the borders. You name it. Let's go
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:28.320]  ahead and take some calls on attack on America, folks. That's what's happening. Wyatt in Maryland,
[1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:34.000]  we have predicted it. And now it's happening. Go ahead. Right. Okay. I'm watching Washington DC
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:39.520]  Channel 9 and it's showing the Pentagon. It's got a massive split. If you know how the Pentagon
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:45.280]  shaped, it's just a big chunk taking right out of it. They reported that 26 people were injured.
[1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:50.960]  They haven't caused, they haven't said any deaths as of yet. Thank God that's low numbers now.
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:57.280]  That's right. Okay. Now, listen, you predicted this. We didn't, we didn't realize, you know,
[1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:01.920]  we always said, well, though they incrementally have been successful. We said, well, one day
[1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:06.720]  they'll come down. The only reason they haven't come down with a big hammer is because we have guns.
[1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:13.280]  Well, this is the big hammer. This is the entire destruction of this nation as we know it. Every
[1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:18.640]  thing we do for now one will be entirely different. Alex, everything we do, that's what
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:24.000]  McCain is saying. That's right. Now, I work at the, I work for BWI Airport and I go past the
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.080]  Pentagon all the time and I often say, my God, the Pentagon is wide open for attack, but that's
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:34.320]  the, that decides that. Now, listen, Alex, I'm not a Bible thumper at all. Okay. But just listen
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:38.800]  to me for a second, please. Because, because everyone listening can take their Bibles and look
[1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:45.040]  at this. Revelation 17 describes exactly what's taking place right now at this very moment.
[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:50.880]  What happened in New York? Now, if you take the airlines. Well, read it to us. Okay. Oh my God,
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:55.920]  Alex, it's too long. It's, it's huge. I mean, it's, it's lots of words. Yeah. Okay. Now,
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:19:06.160]  just here are the flight numbers. Flight 11, flight 77, flight 175 and flight 33. Now,
[1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:11.680]  numbers is a language just like our language. Yeah. 33, the occultist at Bohemian Grove and all
[1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:16.640]  of this are obsessed with it. Okay. You take these numbers and you add them together and you get a
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:28.400]  total of 296. Now, you take two plus nine is 11 plus six is 17. And in Revelation 17, it describes
[1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:35.280]  what's taking place. Now, I have no idea if it's coincidence or whatever, but still the numbers
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:42.000]  are there. The language is there. This as your guest indicated, I watched that building come
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.720]  down time and time again. And I said, that's an implosion. There's no way that building could
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:52.640]  do what it did. This is, this was designed. I said, I told my friends, I told everybody I know,
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:56.640]  I said, no, I'm not accusing anyone of this. Listen, I'm not accusing anyone. I said,
[1:19:57.280 --> 1:20:02.240]  President Bush is not in Crawford, Texas for a 30. You've never put them on like they should.
[1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:08.080]  You got it right. You got it right. So it was planned. But look, those buildings are designed
[1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:13.440]  to prevent that from happening. I agree with you. There's something wrong that there was a
[1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:18.560]  progressive explosion process that brought those buildings down. Well, we had the engineer on to
[1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:23.040]  talk about it. Those buildings went straight down. John, what do you see happening? They're
[1:20:23.040 --> 1:20:29.520]  really gearing up. Oh, yeah. Life has changed. I don't think we can accept what we've expected.
[1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:35.600]  I don't think that there's anything new to make of all of this. It's the world turned upside down.
[1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:42.720]  So what are you going to do? I'm going to clean my weapon, man. I'm going to clean my weapon.
[1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:50.160]  My problem, my only worry is that I don't want to go alone. I'm not afraid to go,
[1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:56.400]  but I just don't want to go by myself. These people, these government agents,
[1:20:56.400 --> 1:21:02.000]  they ought to be ostracized. First, they ought to be identified, and then they ought their pictures
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:07.520]  and posters ought to be publicly displayed. They ought to be ostracized in the church and
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:11.680]  everywhere else. John, I appreciate your call. We don't know if the government did this. We know
[1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:14.880]  they did the other ones. We know they kept telling us it was going to happen, and we know who stands
[1:21:14.880 --> 1:21:20.320]  to gain. I know this, though, ladies and gentlemen. I'm not going to any FEMA center. What about you?
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:25.760]  We kept warning you about this over and over again. We weren't playing games,
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:30.320]  and now it's unfolding in front of your face. All the latest news from everywhere
[1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:38.640]  is on infowars.com. Oh my goodness. You talk about patriotism. I'm the ultimate patriot.
[1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:43.760]  I love this country. I fight for it every day. There's going to be a patriotism whipped up
[1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:50.640]  to attack the Middle East, a total invasion. Iran, Iraq, you name it, Pakistan, Afghanistan.
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:56.400]  It came out a few weeks ago, World Net Daily, ABC, that Bush was preparing for a ground war with Iraq.
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:01.360]  And, you know, there's one person that might be able to pull this off, but everything he does
[1:22:01.360 --> 1:22:06.720]  is tapped and traced, and that is Saddam Hussein. Why this government ever put him in power in the
[1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:12.000]  70s? Why he was our big buddy to fight Iran? Why he was given the chemical and biological weapons
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:16.800]  from Houston? If Saddam did do this, and there is a chance that this is not the government,
[1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:22.720]  that it is Saddam Hussein, I want that country nuked, and I want it nuked now. And the question is,
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:31.600]  why didn't they take Saddam out in 1991? I asked you that question. What did you just say, Mark?
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:41.040]  And General Parton's not home? Busy signal. Whoever's calling Parton, please quit. When I
[1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:45.520]  mentioned that, everybody probably called him. Just keep trying, Mark. And we'll get Derry Brownfield
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:52.320]  back on, and then Jim right there at the scene in New York. Let's go ahead. For those that don't
[1:22:52.320 --> 1:23:00.160]  know, we've had planes crashing, plane crashing the Pentagon. It blew up, was on fire outside
[1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:05.360]  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the International Airport. A huge plane crashed and blew up
[1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:14.880]  on the runway. We had two planes. The first one this morning wanted 850 Eastern Time, hit the
[1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:25.680]  World Trade Center, a larger plane at 920, and then the towers began imploding about an hour later.
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:33.280]  So that's what's developing there. 1015 Eastern World Trade Center, South Tower collapses.
[1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:42.320]  1030, Second Tower, North collapses. And now they've got civil emergency. Just replace that with
[1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:49.200]  Marshall Law. Rolling in the country. My goodness. Bill in Tennessee, you're on the air. Thanks for
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:55.200]  holding. At Texas. Okay, Texas. Go ahead, Bill. Well, I don't see you. First of all, I don't think
[1:23:55.200 --> 1:24:01.280]  there's a government sponsor. That's my opinion. Okay. Secondly, you know, I don't see how an
[1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:05.680]  act like this is going to help with illegal immigration and the movement towards that. If
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:13.680]  anything, if anything, I think it's going to make people refocus on why illegal immigration is so
[1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:17.120]  bad. Well, that's the point I've made. They tell us to give up our rights and drive through
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:21.120]  checkpoints. We live in the heartland, but then they've got the borders wide open and
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:26.320]  porous and then have been advertising how open we are to terrorist attack. That in and of itself
[1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:31.360]  is a grand crime. No question. And I think that people will get refocused on that. And I think
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:36.720]  they're going to have a really tough time modifying the law. I really don't see Marshall
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:43.280]  Law being declared. Sir, it's already civil emergency. And I've got dozens of the states.
[1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:48.640]  But, but Alex, this is a normal response to a major issue. I mean, so are you in the military?
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:54.080]  I used to be. Okay. I'm a retired officer. Well, we support the military. Most of the troops I
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:58.560]  know agree with the analysis we have here. We don't know who's done this, but are you telling me
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:04.560]  how someone been locked and could coordinate all of these, these, these four attacks?
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:09.200]  Well, I'm telling you that there are lots of people who are mercenary for hire that have been
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:14.320]  caught in covert activities for many countries. A mercenary is going to fly a plane into a building.
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:18.480]  No, you didn't let me finish what I was saying. I believe that there are enough
[1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:23.920]  panicles by organizations throughout the world and have enough finances and connections to pull off
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:28.000]  something like this. I will say this is a good chance Europe could be behind this. They're rolling
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:34.400]  out their Euro right now. It becomes the full currency in two and a half months. And with the
[1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:38.320]  World Trade Center collapsing the center of the dollar and they're partially go back with their
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:44.240]  Euro, you might have a point there. But I'm more, I more think it's that than the U.S.
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:48.960]  government behind it. I really, well, who controls and owns our Federal Reserve though? Well, the
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:57.520]  European family. You got it. I'm not saying that, you know, that, that Ashcroft knows about this.
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:03.280]  These people don't run our country, sir. Big giant tax free foundations and the council on
[1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:08.640]  farm relations and the rest of them. I know the council in Rome with all the families that go
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:12.880]  back from whenever are the ones that call a lot of shots and have all the wealth and
[1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:18.800]  have been plotting this for years. And put Hitler into power. I mean, they torched Europe to get a
[1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:25.680]  U.N. They failed World War I to get the League of Nations. Well, the only reason I say it's not a
[1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:33.280]  U.S. attack, Alex, is simply that it appears to me by all the things I've seen and read and they
[1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:37.680]  looked a little caught off guard by this quite frankly. Yeah, Bush looked pretty freaked out,
[1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:45.200]  didn't he? He did. He did. Well, keep sending the message out. Thanks for taking my call.
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:50.640]  All right, I appreciate the call. I know this, that little creature McCain, that Manchurian
[1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:55.440]  candidate who turned against the men in the plantation. He wasn't in the Hanoi Hilton
[1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:01.760]  has been dancing around telling us we need a police state. And now I've got him on tape.
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:06.480]  I gotta go change the tape during the next break on the VCR. I got that creature on tape saying,
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:09.920]  we'll never live the same. Gotta give up our rights. Who's up next here, Mark?
[1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:15.360]  John in Washington State, you're on the air, sir. Welcome.
[1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:23.920]  Hi, Alex. I just thought I'd tell you what was going on up here. The sheriff just declared Spokane
[1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:32.080]  on a special alert and they're claiming that we're going to be highly scrutinized. They say
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:40.640]  that they have their operatives keeping close eyes on all those patriot type. And I have another
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:47.040]  little goodie for you last Friday. I was coming home from a doctor's appointment and saw a strange
[1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:52.560]  parade going down the road. Was a bunch of APCs. They weren't National Guard, they were Army.
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:28:00.320]  And they had huge generators, the kind that you use to power small cities. They had several of them.
[1:28:00.320 --> 1:28:06.560]  They had a tanker truck following that. So I followed them. And I followed them for about 35,
[1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:12.880]  40 miles. And then they go to a place called Missile Steyer Road. They pull in. I was really
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:17.840]  unfamiliar with the area, but I had been around there before. And then right down towards the
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:23.280]  end of the road, they fanned out and threw up a roadblock. And two guys got out of a black pickup
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:32.160]  truck and went out of a white Astro van, dressed in navy blue, poplin, Cambridge style jackets
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:37.920]  and slacks. And they had Tech DC-9. Well, I sure wish you'd had a video camera. I got pictures.
[1:28:38.480 --> 1:28:44.320]  I want to overnight photograph everything except where they pulled out the weapons because at
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:50.320]  that point, frankly, I was hauling these loins in another direction. I spun my truck around
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:57.520]  through gravel all over them and left right between the two of them. My wife actually,
[1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:03.600]  a week before, saw a tank out there at the same place when she was riding her 10-speed bike.
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:07.840]  I did see that they had other trends or other generators set up out there.
[1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:13.040]  We have Czechoslovakian troops over the last three years massing in Texas.
[1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:18.560]  We have military checkpoints on video on infowars.com. Just watch the clips for free.
[1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:24.640]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen them and I've got your tapes as well. But I'm also the fellow that
[1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:32.880]  occasionally calls you. I'm a commissioner up here. And so they drew down on me. And I went down
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:38.080]  this morning and tendered my resignation. I'll not be part of any of this or even be mildly
[1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:43.040]  associated with it. You should have stayed in to help warm people. Oh, no, no, no, no. They treat
[1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:47.840]  me like dirt anyway. Now, they treat me. They treat me terribly because I say all those stupid
[1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:54.080]  nasty words like Constitution Bill of Rights. Yeah, yeah, the stuff that gets buildings blown up.
[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:58.000]  Oh, yeah. Well, I have no doubt that I'm being watched now, too, because the sheriff just said
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:05.120]  so on television. He said that he has his people out here watching all these patriot types closely.
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:10.320]  And also, I might tell you that down here at Rock Point Center is one of our nicest
[1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:18.000]  office buildings. The FBI just threw out everybody in the executive suite and took the
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:27.040]  entire executive suite over. And they have moved over 200 additional new agents into this city,
[1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:33.920]  residing at Rock Point Center on Washington Avenue. And they've taken over the entire
[1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:41.840]  executive suite area. So I happened to have weedled my way in there last Friday as well and got
[1:30:41.840 --> 1:30:47.920]  photographed of it. It's empty as a gourd. And I ran into two guys that were pulling fiber optic
[1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:55.600]  cable through the offices there. And they asked me what I was doing in there. And I had my trailer
[1:30:55.600 --> 1:31:02.480]  and a jumpsuit on. So I look like I was a mover or something. And the guys asked me what I was
[1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:08.160]  doing in there. And I told them I kind of like one of those numbers you pull the Bohemian Grove.
[1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:13.760]  I kind of had to think on my feet. And I said, I'm here for the death. And the two guys said,
[1:31:14.320 --> 1:31:18.560]  oh, well, get that blank, the blank thing out of here. And they took me over there. And lo and
[1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:24.800]  behold, there was in fact a death. And they made me take a desk out of the FBI office and put it
[1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:31.200]  in my truck and take it away. And now I've got the thing. They made me steal the death. It was either
[1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:38.560]  that or get caught. But I got photographed of that too. Sir, don't send me the originals. Do you
[1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:44.080]  have access to a computer to email them as a JPEG to Alex at info wars.com? Yeah, I'll do that.
[1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:50.080]  I need the APPs now. Get on it, sir. I appreciate the call. I've got another set of documents that
[1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:57.200]  I need to send you on this that is the job roster from the internal communications of the military.
[1:31:57.200 --> 1:32:02.160]  And it's the job roster for the training of all the people that they're going to be needing and
[1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:07.280]  using to secure this. And it's called red train opportunities. Does that ring a bell?
[1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:13.840]  The red and blue list and so forth. I don't know. Listen, I really appreciate the call, sir.
[1:32:15.120 --> 1:32:24.880]  Again, to recap at 850 a.m. Eastern time, Plain Hidth World Trade Center 820 FBI says at least
[1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:30.800]  one plane hijacked 930. Second jet crashes into the World Trade Center 940 Eastern. Plain hits
[1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:37.280]  Pentagon. Federal officials said a U.S. airplane has hit the Pentagon. The crash comes nearly
[1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:42.160]  an hour after two planes hit the World Trade Center building. Folks, this is 100 times bigger than
[1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:47.120]  Pearl Harbor. Why do you think all these films came out? Band of brothers, all these war movies,
[1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:51.280]  even a Washington Post writer said, well, we get ready for a war. This always happens.
[1:32:51.280 --> 1:32:58.880]  1013, all U.S. buildings, Capitol Hill evacuated. 1015, World Trade Center South Tower collapses.
[1:32:58.880 --> 1:33:03.120]  1020, report explosion at Capitol. 1030, U.S. congressional leaders,
[1:33:03.120 --> 1:33:09.520]  top cabinet officials moving to secure facilities. 1030, another hijacked plane reported 20 minutes
[1:33:09.520 --> 1:33:17.120]  south of Washington, D.C. 1030, second tower north collapses. 1043, hijacked plane crashes
[1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:21.280]  south of Pittsburgh, PA. Officials investigating at another hijacking with a plane headed toward
[1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:25.760]  D.C. never heard what happened with that. Probably been shot down. 1045 AM EDT, all federal
[1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:32.400]  buildings in D.C. have been evacuated. By the way, October 1st, all new cell phones have to have
[1:33:32.400 --> 1:33:39.520]  a satellite tracking chip in them. Men reporting on that for years. The children are already having
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:43.520]  to come stand to get their school lunches and 100-plus school districts. Come on, people.
[1:33:43.520 --> 1:33:50.320]  I'm not trying to scare you. Be bold. Stand up. They're not going to get away with this pretext.
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:57.680]  Let's go ahead, and before we go to more calls, let's get Derry Brownfield back on the line.
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:34:02.560]  But first, let's get Jim Wright on there in New York. It was in the World Financial Center
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:07.360]  next door who heard the first plane hit, walked out and saw the second one hit, and then saw
[1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:11.040]  them collapse from a mile and a half away, dead bodies, people falling out of the windows.
[1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:18.800]  The whole nine yards. I can't believe this is actually happening, but it is. I didn't make the
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:24.400]  stuff up when I told you it would here on the air. It is a travesty. Police, military, if you love
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:31.200]  your family, fine. Fight the enemy and we find out it's terrorist. But they're going to tell us
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:34.880]  their whole society has to change now that the people are the enemy. They're announcing that on
[1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:40.480]  the news. It is not going to help anything. You know, they'll have us running through checkpoints
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:44.320]  daily and having our houses searched. I guarantee you that southern border is going to stay open,
[1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:49.760]  and it's just a travesty. Europe may be behind this. There is a fishery. There is an internal
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:56.400]  struggle between the New World Order right now. Germany runs the EU. They swore the annihilation
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:04.400]  of the US. They put people into power to take over this country, and it's in between Muslim
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:08.560]  terrorists being provocateur and allowed to do this. It's in between our government doing it,
[1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:12.640]  and it's in between the EU doing it. Frankly, I'm starting to lean towards the EU and that power
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:20.320]  block that runs a lot of our news here. Alright, let's bring Jim right up. Jim, you were there
[1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:26.000]  today. Now World Trade Center 5 or 6 is burning. Another 50-60 story building. What are you seeing
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:30.960]  there? What's happening? Well, it's truly about the same as last time we talked to Alex. That
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:39.600]  building's still burning about the same amount. We don't hear the sirens anymore than we were
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:47.440]  hearing earlier. It's just kind of settling in for the siege to see how long it takes to get
[1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:53.760]  the smoke out. So that building is still on fire? Still standing, still on fire.
[1:35:53.760 --> 1:36:01.040]  I wondered if it's going to collapse in an instant like the other ones. It's no way of knowing.
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:05.200]  And again, you have a degree in engineering. Have you ever heard of a building that's on fire on
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:16.320]  the top collapsing with such precision? No, I haven't. Well, it's an absolute nightmare.
[1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:21.040]  Can you briefly recap what you saw this morning when the first plane hit and you heard the
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:29.280]  vibration and then what happened? Yeah, we saw the first building that was on fire about the top
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:36.720]  10 floors or from 100 up. We were watching that for some time. I actually saw some
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:45.600]  bodies come out of the building. Some were smoldering, others were flailing and evidently conscious.
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:58.560]  After, I don't know, 15 minutes, I caught the glimpse of, I guess, an airplane just a tip of it
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:05.200]  and saw a huge fireball come out of the building. At that time we evacuated our building, which was
[1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:12.720]  across the street, eventually made our way back across the river about a mile and a half away
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:21.120]  from the site. When we watched the first one building, it blew up from some of the other
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:26.880]  upper floors, almost like a ring of charges all the way around it. And within five seconds,
[1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:32.080]  the building was completely gone. I went straight down in a perfect implosion.
[1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:38.960]  About 20, 30 minutes, I guess, after that, pretty much the same thing happened to the
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:46.400]  second tower. That one took a few more seconds to come down, but it was just a perfect drop of a
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:54.320]  building. No stumps left, no nothing. And from engineering, what does that? It looked like
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:58.960]  it was somehow detonated very heavily or very strategically from the lower floors.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.640]  So no one could get into the wreckage of those planes and find out the evidence of who was behind
[1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:11.840]  it, just like Oklahoma City. They destroyed that building just a few weeks after, still standing
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:15.760]  and buried it under guard at a landfill outside Oklahoma City.
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:23.840]  Well, these buildings are landfill now, but I have no idea what it looks like on the other side
[1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:32.400]  of the plaza to see if any of the wreckage of the planes is left on top. To me, it looked like
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:44.640]  Independence Day, sir. Yeah, it was a war. It was like Armageddon, just certainly like a movie.
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:53.840]  It just wasn't real. It wasn't real. Unbelievable. Anything else you'd like to add,
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:39:00.640]  Jim Wright? What are the local security forces doing? Obviously, on high alert,
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:06.480]  we haven't seen too many military aircraft in the immediate vicinity, just a couple of Tomcats
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:18.960]  circling around once or twice. F-14s? Yeah. Just a couple of them. They're not only circling there,
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:28.480]  they were heading somewhere. All of the emergency personnel seem to be very heavily involved with
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:33.600]  getting people off the island, off of Manhattan Island. They're bringing them into our marina here
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:40.960]  at Liberty State Park because by the fact of Liberty, there's just kind of a low, low of people
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:46.480]  coming from the ferry trying to make their way up toward the turnpike and the light rail system.
[1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:55.360]  I understand all the roadways or the main turnpike is shut down where it parallels Manhattan.
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:01.280]  People aren't able to get out? They seem to be getting out somehow.
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:06.720]  I don't know if they're just walking and walking or exactly how they're doing it,
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:12.000]  but I can tell you that one of the main arteries of New Jersey Turnpike right here
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:19.360]  in the vicinity of St. Acosta River from lower Manhattan, there is no traffic on that roadway.
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:24.080]  They've shut the road down. Now they've shut the borders down. Why do you think they do that,
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:31.200]  Jim? They're on the scene. The water? Excuse me? Why do you think they shut down the roads?
[1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:35.520]  I don't know. I have no idea. I've heard nothing on the news whether or not it's
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:45.280]  get emergency vehicles through or I honestly don't know. I don't own a vehicle.
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:50.320]  All the TV stations are down other than the Spanish-speaking language?
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:55.760]  Yeah, but last time I checked, it's been a while since actually I've tried to flip through.
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:41:03.200]  I've been listening to emergency radio, VHF. It looks like we're still in the same situation
[1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:08.640]  with News Network, TV. Because the main antennas were on top of that building?
[1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:14.480]  I presume that's what's happened, yeah. Did you ever think you'd see this in the United States?
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:22.000]  No, I really didn't. We've been kind of always conditioned to believe this is the one place we
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:28.480]  haven't had any overt, at least foreign terrorism and I'm presuming this is foreign. Who knows?
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:35.440]  Maybe it's internal, maybe not. But yeah, we feel pretty insulated against that.
[1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:40.720]  We're getting the analysis that it may be the EU. They're rolling out their new currency.
[1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:45.520]  It's already starting to throttle the dollar. They're distributing it as a world currency to
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:52.240]  Africa, Middle East, Asia, and then suddenly our financial center is brought down. We've been in
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:59.760]  two wars with Europe and I have the EU observer here. From yesterday, Prince Socialist developed
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:06.080]  European strategies and a new manifesto. They call for Europe first against the US.
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:12.320]  They call for international Tobin tax and UN expanded power. Frankly, the EU stands more to
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:16.960]  gain from this than any Islamic terrorist or this government. The more I look at it,
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:22.640]  you probably don't want to comment on that. I'm sure there's probably a lot of people that would
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:28.720]  see themselves as gaining from a tragedy like this and maybe that's a plausible one and there's
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:32.640]  probably a lot of other plausible scenarios. I know you work in Europe in these financial
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:39.280]  sectors. The EU is pretty powerful. Well, the EU is pretty powerful, but I tell you what, a lot of,
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:44.480]  at least in Europe, a lot of those countries are very, very dependent upon stability in the US
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:51.920]  and US currency flowing overseas. I don't know. For everybody that may get help by this,
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:59.280]  there's probably a lot of entities or people that get hurt by it. Jim Ryan, I will probably
[1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:04.080]  check in with you another hour, so just for a quick five minute update. We really appreciate
[1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:07.680]  you and you're really handling this in a calm fashion. Frankly, better than I am and I'm here
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:15.280]  in Austin, Texas. Well, I don't know. Maybe that's your job. I don't know. Anyway, yeah,
[1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:22.000]  sure, Alex. I'll try to stick around. All right. Thank you, sir. There goes Jim Wright, family friend.
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:27.360]  His family lives out in Fredericksburg, Texas, listening to 91.7 want to say hi to the booths
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:31.760]  out there on the right. We're going to continue with your calls throughout the broadcast. I want
[1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:36.160]  to thank Ted Anderson for the opportunity to cover this uncensored. I want to thank all our AM&M
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:43.360]  affiliates. This is so important that we get the news and information out to everybody.
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:50.320]  And I will continue the broadcast for the next hour and five minutes, and then you'll have the
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:54.960]  John Stathamiller with the National Intel Report. Then after that, the modest report,
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:44:02.240]  Dr. Stan Montee will be live countless other excellent shows to bring you exactly
[1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:08.000]  what you need to know about the developments here and the analysis of some of the foremost experts
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:15.920]  in the country. I wanted to recap this. Bin Laden comes home to ruse to CIA ties only the beginning
[1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:24.640]  of a woeful story. At the CIA, it happens often enough to have a code name, Blow Black. Simply
[1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:31.120]  define this term who describes an agent, an operative or an operation that has turned on its
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:36.160]  creators. Some of Bin Laden, our new public enemy number one, is the personification of Blow Black,
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:41.120]  and the fact that he is viewed as a hero of millions of Islamic world proves, again, the old
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:49.200]  adage, you reap what you sow. MSNBC. Let's bring Derry Brown filled up. He's got to go to a meeting
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:54.960]  in a few minutes. Mr. Brown filled any of the latest developments and your take on this,
[1:44:54.960 --> 1:45:00.880]  one of the biggest tragedies in American history. Well, I have some information here.
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:05.600]  We said earlier in the show, Alex, that the barters had been closed in Canada and Mexico.
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:15.520]  I have here some information. Let me see where it comes from. The FAA says 50 flights are in U.S.
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:21.600]  Airspace, but none are reporting any problems. The Immigration and Naturalization Service says
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:27.200]  U.S. barters with Canada and Mexico are on high a state of alert, but no decision has been made
[1:45:27.200 --> 1:45:32.320]  about closing barters. That's funny. I have the AP story here where they say that. Say they have
[1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:37.760]  closed a barter. Well, I don't know. A lot of confusion. Yeah, there is. San Francisco International
[1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:42.240]  Airport is evacuated and shut down. Can you stay with us for five more minutes? Sure, sure. We'll
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:52.480]  be back in 60 seconds. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen. According to the news and medical
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:58.560]  journals, Americans are under assault from a new monster, Fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia affects
[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:06.480]  millions with supposedly no real cure. Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:14.880]  Do you want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now,
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:18.560]  live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:30.880]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live. We've got loaded phones. We're going to go to them.
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:37.760]  We've got Derry Brownfield, nationally syndicated radio talk show host. And we're also going to
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:41.920]  cover Bush's remarks from his nationally televised address. Going back to Derry Brownfield,
[1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:46.800]  then to your calls. Mr. Brownfield, any other information that you've been tracking down
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:52.800]  or any other points you'd like to make about this, this attack? Is that the San Francisco
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:58.000]  International Airport was shut down. The airport was the destination of American Airlines Flight
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:05.680]  77. And that was one of the aircraft that went into the World Trade Center. And then LA International
[1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:12.080]  Airport, the destination of two of the hijacked American Airlines flight is evacuated. The United
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:18.720]  Airlines confirms that Flight 175 from Boston to LA has crashed with 56 passengers and nine crew
[1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:24.640]  members abroad. Emergency personnel at the scene say there are no survivors. Why are these airplanes
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:31.040]  crashing? Do you have any idea, Alex? Now, is this a plane other than the four that went into the
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:37.680]  Trade Center into the... Well, I don't know. Into Pittsburgh and into the Pentagon? I don't have any
[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:45.200]  idea. Well, we know they've got fighter jets scrambled everywhere. So they could have shot
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:49.840]  the thing down, you suppose? Yeah, we'll probably never know. That's something they're not going to
[1:47:49.840 --> 1:47:55.280]  ever announce. I have no idea. I guess it'll be like TWA Flight 800. They'll just tell us
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:01.120]  that it doesn't matter. We've got Army witnesses that you didn't see a missile. But frankly,
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:05.040]  I mean, that's a question. Would we support shooting down an airplane full of people that
[1:48:05.040 --> 1:48:09.280]  have been hijacked if it's going for a World Trade Center? And I have to say, frankly, yes.
[1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:13.840]  But at the same time, how many is it going to kill when it hits the ground in a population center?
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:20.560]  Well, I was going to say, how many people were killed when it hit the World Trade Center?
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:26.240]  It certainly would have been better off shot down out over the harbor someplace,
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:31.760]  wouldn't it? No, I agree with you wholeheartedly. So what are they going to do? Start stationing
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:37.200]  guys with stinger missiles on top of buildings everywhere? I know I've seen video of the White
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:44.080]  House before with guys with stinger missiles on the top. I have no idea. I'll tell you what,
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:51.040]  I'm becoming sort of numb about this whole thing. Oh, I am too. I've already been on the air three
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:55.040]  hours counting your show and we're just going to continue to cover it throughout the day, Mr.
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:49:01.360]  Brownfield. Jeff just walked in here. I'm going to let him take a moment to mark up some copy.
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:10.240]  Here's what he's saying. He says, in 1945, an Army Air Corps B-25, a twin-engine bomber,
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:15.600]  crashed into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building in Denton. Oh, it didn't hurt the building
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:21.840]  if you remember. Yes. I mean, you may not remember 1945, but I do. Well, it's an old-fashioned building
[1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:30.960]  and it's a lot tougher. But do you really believe that it probably is? But I still don't believe
[1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:35.200]  that plane would have taken. In fact, when the planes hit those buildings, they didn't go down
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:40.320]  right away. Hey, we had a guy on the show who's one of the witnesses who has an engineering degree.
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:43.680]  He says, that looked like textbook explosives planted on the columns.
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:51.040]  Yeah, I heard that. Here's another comment. The Navy has ordered a pair of aircraft carriers
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:56.640]  to depart the Norfolk Virginia Naval Station and deploy off the coast of New York City and
[1:49:56.640 --> 1:50:03.280]  Washington to provide air cover to both cities in case of new threat following terrorist attacks.
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:10.480]  The President has no choice but to strike back. But the key questions are how and at whom.
[1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:16.800]  Bush must decide where to take revenge. I'm just reading some of the...
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:21.920]  Just then, Tony Blair, British Prime Minister, admitted communist has stopped all civil
[1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:25.680]  flights over the U.K., but he's going to keep us safe. And there he stays right there,
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:30.960]  because I want you to continue. This is Bush's comments. Bush promises to track down terrorists.
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:37.600]  This is Barksdale Air Force Base. Louisiana has chaos. Unhinged, New York and Washington,
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:43.760]  President Bush commanded the full force of the United States government to hunt down and find
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:48.800]  the terrorists responsible. Terrorism against our nation will not stand, he declared, Tuesday.
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:53.520]  If they don't attack somebody and level entire countries, we'll be attacked daily.
[1:50:53.520 --> 1:50:58.880]  In Florida, a pair of education speeches, the President scrapped his schedule and said at the
[1:50:58.880 --> 1:51:06.080]  first reports of attacks on New York, came up on the board and said that nine stands for judgment
[1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:14.160]  and 11 for disorder. Really? And it shows how the globalist, everything is 33, everything is 7-11,
[1:51:14.160 --> 1:51:18.960]  all of these occultic numbers. That makes sense as well. I'm making this stuff up, folks. I mean,
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:25.600]  look at all this. Look at the flight numbers, 33. Flight 800 also. Flight 800 is one of them.
[1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:30.880]  I recall hearing a flight 800, didn't you? Yeah, they do it over and over again.
[1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:34.800]  Derry Brownfield, this stuff gets weirder and weirder, but look at Scullin' Bones, New York
[1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:38.800]  Observer dressed up in devil outfits, slitting women's throats. And I don't want to get off
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:43.280]  into all of this, but you talked about it. This is judgment one way or another, isn't it?
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.480]  If it is, and it's like you're smacking us in the face with it.
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:48.960]  Do we have Derry Brownfield there? Yeah, I'm still here.
[1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:52.160]  Derry, any comments on what our guest is bringing up?
[1:51:52.160 --> 1:51:57.280]  No, not really on the 9-1-1. I do have a little information on Israel here that
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:04.400]  the Israel is pledging to aid. Pledging aid to U.S. Ally called for an all-out war on terrorist
[1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:09.280]  ill... Israel pledged to give its full support to the United States and called for an all-out
[1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:15.520]  war on terrorism following the attacks on its leading ally on Tuesday in a defensive move
[1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:21.600]  and following the U.S. example after the plane attacked Israel, closed it their airport airspace
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:27.440]  for 24 hours through all incoming flight. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said the Jewish
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:33.120]  state was ready to provide the United States with all possible aid in talks with U.S. Ambassador.
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:36.480]  And that means they're nuclear weapons. Well, I would assume so.
[1:52:36.480 --> 1:52:41.680]  Yeah, we could see nuclear war within the day. In fact, I had a report last night that we covered
[1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:49.040]  that Israel's very upset saying Iran now has nukes and the missiles to deliver them.
[1:52:51.120 --> 1:52:57.040]  It's just, folks, this could be the beginnings of Armageddon. I hate to say that, but we certainly
[1:52:57.040 --> 1:53:01.120]  have the ingredients, don't we, Derry? Well, it looks like it, doesn't it? And you've heard
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:06.480]  me say time and time again, once you read the back of the book, you begin to see a different picture.
[1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:12.240]  And you look at the overall picture, I'd definitely say we are in the end time.
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:17.760]  I believe it's right as well, Alec. Now, when we talk about the end times to Christians,
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:20.720]  that doesn't mean the end. That means the start of the good stuff.
[1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:27.680]  Yes. Do you see what I mean? I think we're the true believers are looking forward
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:38.240]  to this next thousand years. So, but again, you have to have studied this.
[1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:44.480]  The person can also be part of the birth pains. Absolutely. And again, if people don't understand
[1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:48.880]  this, I caught world leaders. It's been an Esquire magazine. It's been in the press, Democrat,
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:55.120]  front page, mainstream, San Francisco paper. It's been on national television in Europe.
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:59.360]  I stuck in and caught world leaders in black and red robes, worshiping the devil.
[1:53:59.360 --> 1:54:02.960]  So, why are you offended by us talking about how we're Christians and how our
[1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:08.400]  Bible tells us this would happen in detail? And we're kooky, but world leaders can dance
[1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:12.720]  around worshiping MOLIC. I mean, if world leaders are worshiping the devil, we're going to be
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:17.520]  judged. Nations are judged. That is the bottom line. Would you agree, Mr. Brownfield?
[1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:21.440]  Absolutely. And that's what I said earlier today. I think I've said it two or three times on
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:29.600]  national radio that it's difficult for me to pray for America today. I can pray for God's people,
[1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:34.160]  and I can pray that as many of people are going to be saved as they possibly can. But when our
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:40.960]  own children cannot go to a public American government school and stand up and sing, God bless
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:46.960]  America. How can God bless America? I think the fetal tissue is part of it. I think the
[1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:51.680]  trading with China, giving them the Olympics when they killed their political dissidents and blew up 450 churches
[1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:58.000]  publicly last year when they're murdering the Tibetans. Well, go a little closer to home.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:03.200]  How about all the murdering we're doing to our own children? Yes. The drugging of them, the abortion.
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:08.960]  We're being judged, ladies and gentlemen. Now, this is the, I think it's just the beginning,
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:17.040]  Alex. And decadent societies are always judged. Well, they have been, and they will continue to be.
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:20.960]  That's you guys are exactly right. I'll leave you alone. Thank you, Darren.
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:27.360]  Blessed is the nation that believes in God, you know, and cursed is the ones that don't.
[1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:34.400]  And you can see who all these years have benefited and who all these years have starved and had
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:39.440]  war. See, America, American people don't even know what war is. To my knowledge, this is the
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:44.480]  first time there has ever been an attack on American soil. Other than the British.
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:48.960]  Well, yeah, but I'm talking about in modern history, anything that anybody can remember.
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:53.680]  See, we went through two World Wars and never was attacked.
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:01.520]  Yeah, we had some German agents, blow up a weapons dump in New York with the media never
[1:56:01.520 --> 1:56:05.440]  covered that. They said it was an accident. Well, I don't know. But no, you're right.
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:10.160]  That's the only, I mean, nothing that we consciously saw or could address. That was on the
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:14.880]  history channel, though. You're right. Nothing massive like this. I just don't know what to
[1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:17.600]  say to any of it. For those just tuning in that don't know what we're talking about.
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:22.400]  Four planes, both the World Trade Center towers with tens of thousands of people in them have
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:29.840]  collapsed, hit by large passenger planes. A plane hit the Pentagon blowing up a large portion of
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:34.720]  that catching it on fire. And then outside Pittsburgh, PA, one slam into their international
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:41.040]  airport, probably shot down by by fighters. Fighters are swarming everywhere. Four carriers
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:46.560]  have delivered their payload of planes out into the air. We've got jets scrambled everywhere.
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:52.080]  They're flying around here in Texas right now above us. And they're declaring civil emergency
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:56.560]  and putting the feds out on the streets in major capital cities. Why would they be flying over
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:02.880]  Austin, Texas? I don't know. I was outside earlier and there goes a jet flying by.
[1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:08.320]  We've got Fort Hood and they may be deploying them. We've got about five
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:12.880]  airport spaces just south of me in San Antonio. Okay. Well, I'm not very far from
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:20.080]  the base up at Warnsburg and where they keep the self jets. And I haven't seen or heard anything.
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:26.560]  I don't know. It's amazing. Absolutely amazing. Who's up next again, Mark?
[1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:33.120]  Wally in Minnesota, you're on the air with Derry Brownfield and Alex Jones as we watch
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:38.880]  the teeth being pulled out of the front of America's mouth. That's basically what those
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:44.640]  buildings look like. Like they've knocked our teeth out. Go ahead, Wally. Hi,
[1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:50.720]  Alex. Morning, Alex. I couldn't believe it. I worked the graveyard shift and so I usually
[1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:57.520]  sleep till about noon. I woke up this morning, turned on the TV here. I was totally floored.
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:04.800]  I can't believe what I'm seeing. New York City's on fire. I think this obviously shows
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:10.880]  that the United States immigration policy is flawed. The borders of this country should have
[1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:17.520]  been closed down or restricted many, many, many moons ago. Obviously, the terrorists were able
[1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:21.760]  to get in this country. They're not going to do that. They're going to track and trace you and
[1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:25.840]  your family biometrically. The thumb scan to get food as they're already putting them in,
[1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:29.520]  and the borders are going to be wide open, brother. You know, as well as I do, Alex,
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:34.560]  that is the fatal flaw that we have made. These terrorists were able to come into the United
[1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:41.920]  States, get on a commercial jet, coordinate their tourist activities, hijack at least four,
[1:58:41.920 --> 1:58:46.400]  and maybe two others. Right. Now, what does that say about our immigration policy in the United
[1:58:46.400 --> 1:58:52.480]  States? It says, hey, come on over, throw bombs at the World Trade Center, throw planes at the
[1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:58.320]  World Trade Center. It doesn't matter. Now, the next question I have is this. Before Clinton was
[1:58:58.320 --> 1:59:03.600]  in office, there was another plane that crashed into the White House area when Clinton was in
[1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:09.440]  office. Now, another plane, a commercial jet that crashed into the Pentagon. I'm wondering what kind
[1:59:09.440 --> 1:59:16.000]  of radar protection and protection our government facilities have. Obviously, none. If somebody
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:23.200]  can take a commercial jet. This is a highly, highly, highly sophisticated coordinated action.
[1:59:23.200 --> 1:59:29.280]  That plane flew its route until it got to New York from Boston. It turned dramatically, flew
[1:59:29.280 --> 1:59:35.440]  under radar, literally in between buildings. Right. That's what I'm saying. Now, how does the plane,
[1:59:35.440 --> 1:59:41.600]  how is that possible? Don't our major government facilities are protected at all by our air force?
[1:59:42.400 --> 1:59:46.160]  It doesn't seem like it. We're going to pull housewives out of their cars at military checkpoints
[1:59:46.160 --> 1:59:49.760]  like we've already been doing in Texas and Tennessee. That's on my website, Main Street
[1:59:49.760 --> 1:59:54.560]  News Stories. That is not, Alex, you know as well as I do. This is not only a terrorist,
[1:59:54.560 --> 2:00:00.560]  don't worry about the Chinese military in the Panama Canal. The threat is the housewife
[2:00:00.560 --> 2:00:04.480]  that has an old revolver in her closet. Mr. Brownfield, any comments? Thanks for the call,
[2:00:04.480 --> 2:00:10.320]  Wally. Not really. I'll tell you what, I have a meeting downtown in about 45 minutes,
[2:00:10.320 --> 2:00:15.360]  so I'm going to need to leave you, Allie. All right, Mr. Brownfield, we appreciate the
[2:00:15.360 --> 2:00:18.880]  opportunity to visit with you and to be on your show and to visit with your listeners.
[2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:22.320]  Well, I know you'll be covering this more throughout the week on your show. Tell them
[2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:30.480]  how they can tune in on your website. Okay. Oh, eriebrownfield.com. And by the way,
[2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:37.760]  Derry is D like in dog, D-E-R-R-Y. And you're on the hour before me on what, 8790 stations?
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:42.320]  Right. Something like that. All right, sir. God bless you. You bet. Thanks again.
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:46.640]  Take care. Let's talk to Tim in Minnesota. Tim, you're on the air. Welcome, sir.
[2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:52.640]  Hey, Alex. What's up? Well, you know what's going on. Take over. I should say what's down.
[2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:57.600]  Anyways, I got a few frequencies for your listeners so they can listen into the
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:05.600]  Marshall Law in progress. It's really active on 10.194 megahertz,
[2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:14.960]  except that's not voice transmissions. But the voice transmission that's pretty active is 10.493
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:24.240]  megahertz. That's 10.493. And that's on the short way of emergency dialed.
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:36.400]  Yeah. Also, there's one more FEMA. 5.211. That's 5.211. The military, they're pretty active.
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:46.160]  I've got one frequency. 11.175 megahertz. 11.175. All right. We'll continue to bring
[2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:50.720]  people up to speed on this. We predicted it, Tim. I predicted it last week, didn't I?
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:56.720]  Yep. I wasn't listening, but I'll take your word for it. Okay. I'm asking you,
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:59.520]  how many times have you heard me say something just like this was going to happen?
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:05.920]  Yeah, we've been all kind of been waiting for something like this to happen. And it's here.
[2:02:05.920 --> 2:02:11.360]  It's time to clean dust off your guns and make sure they're ready to go.
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:16.960]  Absolutely. My car's gassed up. The bags are packed. I'm ready to hit the road if need be.
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:23.680]  All right. Appreciate the call, Tim. Richard in Texas. You're on the air.
[2:02:24.800 --> 2:02:31.360]  Alex. Yes. NBC News, Tom Brokaw. I was shocked when I heard this that possibly
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:36.320]  secondary explosions could have brought down the building. Oh, yeah. There's no way just
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:41.120]  like Oklahoma City. Outside bombs don't do that. They also referred to the 9-1-1 from
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:47.920]  the other caller too. Up here, Dallas DFW National is closed. Lovefield is closed. There's military
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:53.440]  on both airports. There's also reports that the banks, I don't know why they're saying this,
[2:02:53.440 --> 2:02:58.960]  will have money in case you need to withdraw. And that ATM machines will be working. I don't
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:04.320]  know why they're reporting this. It's almost like they want to run. Right. Also, we know Congress
[2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:09.200]  is in hiding. Nobody knows where they are at. Kay Billie Hutchison, one of the senators here,
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:13.760]  is telling her staff to stay away from mass transportation. What does that tell you?
[2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:19.680]  And we have the police here in Austin training to drive pickup routes, as I reported Friday.
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:24.320]  Exactly. Hey, Alex, one more thing. Watch out for yourself. You're a main voice,
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:30.240]  so you know what happens. Hey, you only live once, brother. I look forward to whatever happens. I
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:35.920]  really do. I wasn't born to be a slave. I was born to fight the New World Order. We're going in.
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:40.560]  We're going in full throttle. Nothing can stop us now. We're going to be just fine.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:46.160]  We are folks. There's a lot of good people in the government, a lot of good people in the military,
[2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:50.960]  a lot of good police out there that know what's going on. We warned them up front about all this.
[2:03:50.960 --> 2:03:58.000]  Let's shut the borders down. Let's support the illegals. Let's annihilate whoever did this.
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:03.120]  If they start trying something else, we'll know who's behind it, and then we'll know what to do,
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:09.040]  won't we? Okay. Let's go ahead and go to Ted Anderson. Yeah, go ahead and do Genesis with
[2:04:09.040 --> 2:04:13.520]  an update. Then we'll go to Michael and others. Go ahead, Ted. Yeah, just a quick financial update.
[2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:17.360]  Some of the institutions here in Minneapolis have put limits on the money that you can draw out of
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:21.760]  the account, so don't be too surprised. If you do show up at your bank and they're not going to say,
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:27.520]  yeah, you can walk out with your $40,000 or whatever you have there. There is a lot of chaos
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:32.080]  in the system. I'm sure that the dust will settle within a few days and things will be more back
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:36.080]  to normal, hopefully. Anyways, that's what we hope for. Or this could be the kickoff
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:40.400]  for biological attack, and I'm not speculating. They're reporting that now, Ted. Yeah, I know
[2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:46.560]  they are. I guess basically what I'm saying is don't be too surprised if you walk up your
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:52.720]  institution and find that it's not there. They do have the ability and the written laws and
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:05:01.280]  rights to close down trading the doors at the bank and column. Moratorium, there's been just a few
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:07.600]  guys here in this particular area who have stopped into some of the major central banks,
[2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:12.480]  the major banks, and they have a limit on what you can take out right now. Well,
[2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:16.320]  the Federal Reserve two years ago and their policy board said they want to use the tracking
[2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:21.280]  strip and all the new money to limit the amount of money you take out. And if you hoard money,
[2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:26.960]  they will make it worthless according to the strip. Well, it's just the cracks in the wall.
[2:05:27.520 --> 2:05:31.760]  It's the monetary system that we have. It's a fractional reserve banking system. And now the
[2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:37.920]  center of our commodities and trading has been leveled, Ted. It only bombs and the lower floors
[2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:41.760]  could do that. And that's now being reported, as we're told by the media. This is amazing.
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:45.760]  Are you blown away like I am? Oh, God. And my heart goes out to the people first thing. I
[2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:51.760]  picture this being caught up in this thing or having a family member caught up in this thing.
[2:05:53.280 --> 2:05:59.600]  It's mind-boggling to think of the tragedy that just occurred. But then it's a financial
[2:05:59.600 --> 2:06:05.280]  institution. Those two buildings were worth a tremendous amount of money. And the investors
[2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:11.360]  that put the money behind that particular thing, it sends a shock wave in the financial
[2:06:11.360 --> 2:06:16.320]  industry. There's no question about it. I mean, basically, billions of dollars have just been
[2:06:16.320 --> 2:06:23.280]  lost within a matter of seconds. Right as the EU euro dollars are going online and being delivered.
[2:06:23.280 --> 2:06:26.800]  Well, but that's one of the reasons why a lot of people get into gold, because there could be
[2:06:26.800 --> 2:06:30.240]  gold sitting in the basement of that building. And after they dig the rubble out, the gold's still
[2:06:30.240 --> 2:06:35.920]  valuable. It's the financial institutions right now that we're looking at right now. And with a
[2:06:35.920 --> 2:06:42.080]  very cautious eye, I look at insurance companies, for example, they have these trusts and they have
[2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:49.760]  a tremendous amount of money tied into real estate. If you had a portfolio with these two
[2:06:49.760 --> 2:06:54.320]  buildings in it, you could have basically wiped out a very substantial portion of that.
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:07:00.640]  This is massive. And for those that don't know, let me run back through the basics, a good suggestion
[2:07:00.640 --> 2:07:10.640]  that Ted has made. We had massive attacks at approximately 8.50 this morning. One plane
[2:07:10.640 --> 2:07:19.040]  slammed into World Trade Center South. Then another plane slammed into Trade Center North,
[2:07:19.040 --> 2:07:31.600]  as this unfolds. Then the Pentagon at 9.40 was hit, very concerted. First plane at 8.50. Next one at
[2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:40.400]  8.30. Next one at 9.40. All U.S. buildings on Capitol Hill evacuated at 10.13. Eastern,
[2:07:40.400 --> 2:07:47.200]  10.15. World Trade Center South Tower collapses. 10.20 report explosion at Capitol, 10.30. U.S.
[2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:51.200]  congressional leaders, top cabinet officials moving to secure facilities. 10.30. Another
[2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:57.040]  hijacked plane reported 20 minutes south of Washington, D.C. 10.30. Second Tower North
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:08:03.920]  collapses. Now we're told upwards of five other buildings are burning in downtown New York City.
[2:08:04.800 --> 2:08:09.360]  10.43 hijacked plane crashes south of Pittsburgh, PA. Officials investigating another hijacking
[2:08:09.360 --> 2:08:14.480]  with the plane headed towards D.C. 10.45. EDT. All federal buildings in D.C. have been evacuated
[2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:20.240]  and that's happening across the country. Ted, any other financial developments? What do you see
[2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:24.720]  happening? Well, there's just been a few things. Now some of my customers have been able to wire
[2:08:24.720 --> 2:08:29.680]  funds and there have been some transactions conducted in that fashion. Other banks have
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:35.280]  disallowed that type of activity. Some people have gone into their banks and tried to draw some
[2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:40.560]  money and found that there was a cap or a limit placed on them at this particular time. It's
[2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:45.520]  good to have actually the truth in front of us rather than the fictional lie that there's always
[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:52.560]  cash to be drawn out. But it is a very interesting test on today's economic world. We've been sitting
[2:08:52.560 --> 2:08:59.600]  in a position where we've basically living in a credit card economy and leveraged the health and
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:06.800]  this is a test of the system. It shows how their control makes us all weak. For more details on
[2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:13.680]  the financial news, they're updating MidasResources.com and DCNLive.com as we speak. Infowars.com is
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:20.560]  the news center for all of it. Violet is up there hardly updating everything. Details coming up on
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:25.280]  George W. Bush and his latest address to the public. Ted Anderson, thank you for joining us.
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:29.840]  Please check back in. Yeah, thanks. They'll be checking in throughout the broadcast. Keep it
[2:09:29.840 --> 2:09:35.680]  locked in to your local affiliates and to Genesis Broadcasting. Again, a lot of the evidence of
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:41.200]  government-sponsored terrorism in the past from Pearl Harbor to the World Trade Center in 93
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:49.520]  to Waco to Oklahoma City from sources like the Baltimore Sun are on Infowars.com, MSNBC,
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:55.760]  Bin Laden, known CIA asset. Chickens coming home to roost. We don't make idle claims
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:01.600]  as sensational as it sounds. The smoking gun is coming out of Europe or out of Washington.
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:09.520]  And a bunch of sand at people, and that's what they are. That one could not pull this off.
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:14.240]  They had to train the drivers, cook the bomb in the first World Trade Center bombing that
[2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:17.920]  they meant to take down that building on that support column, but the fuel oil didn't do it.
[2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:23.120]  Let's go to Michael and Georgia, then we'll go to other callers. Michael and Georgia,
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:28.160]  you're on the air, sir. Well, Alex, according to the scenario given put forth by Martin Feeding
[2:10:28.160 --> 2:10:35.040]  and the final D-Hod, the sand people didn't do it alone. They had help from conspirators,
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:41.040]  which were domestic enemies. Let's tell people who this Keating fellow is and how it came out
[2:10:41.040 --> 2:10:46.400]  three years before Oklahoma City. Tell us the story. This morning, Keating has long ties to
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:51.440]  these secret agencies within the United States government to such a degree that he has looked
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:57.520]  upon as a fear, as a profit, that his predictions come eerily, eerily have a tendency to come
[2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:02.960]  true. This is Governor Frank Keating, former PI agent, highest levels. This is his brother
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:09.680]  three years before Oklahoma City bombing. He wrote Final D-Hod where a McVeigh fellow bombs
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:15.760]  the federal building. The article appeared in the USA Today where he was lauded for being so
[2:11:15.760 --> 2:11:21.200]  accurate that while the manuscript said at his publisher an actual guy named McVeigh,
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:25.760]  with ties to right-wing radical Christians, bombed a U.S. federal building. They said,
[2:11:25.760 --> 2:11:30.640]  oh, this guy is a prophet. He had an article that he sent out when you got autographed copies of
[2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:35.360]  his book. He sent you an article from the USA Today calling him a prophet. He should have been
[2:11:35.360 --> 2:11:41.200]  arrested on the spot. Exactly. And listen, over and over again, when you read the covers of this
[2:11:41.200 --> 2:11:47.520]  book and you see how it says, well, his prophecies come true so eerily, you know, fine tingling
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:52.640]  to spin. How does he do it? How is he able to put, listen to this? And then he says inside the book
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:58.320]  to the Knights of the Secret Circle, I dedicate this book. Yeah, exactly. Now, and of course,
[2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:04.960]  I've told you before, the publishing company, Logical Signet Book, their logo is a bomb,
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:11.360]  okay, a lit-use bomb, believe it or not. On the front cover, there are souls and demon heads in
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:18.000]  the pattern in the United States flag that's been patterned by rabbits by terrorism. You can see
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:23.280]  souls and demon heads. I'm not kidding you. And inside this book contained within the covers of
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:28.480]  this book are terrorist attack after terrorist attack where thousands and tens of thousands of
[2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:34.240]  people die almost on every other page. I kid you not. The only thing that what I'm seeing today
[2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:39.760]  is it seems to me is the wet dream of one marked eating coming true. This guy is substantiated
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:45.920]  by these events. And Alex, if we don't go along with whatever George Bush and the government
[2:12:45.920 --> 2:12:52.080]  officials say at this point, we'll be painted as un-American. We'll be painted as if that is
[2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:57.440]  those people that killed these innocent Americans. And what we're going to have to do is we're
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:13:02.720]  really going to have to step up the attack ever since they were killed. To get us into a war
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:10.240]  caught in SA Baltimore Sun. That's on Alex Jones. We're going to be just fine. We're going to shut
[2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:15.760]  down the Baltimore Sun, too. We've also got all these other reports coming out. We're mainstream.
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:20.400]  We're normal. We're just quoting the facts, bringing you the evidence. Now, I'm going to be
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:24.400]  live tonight from nine to midnight. If you don't have an AM or FM station today, be a good day
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:27.360]  for them to switch on and turn the nighttime show. And you'll get the best analysis, the best
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:33.360]  guess. We're trying to get General Benton parting on Craig Roberts, decorated Marine Corps officer
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:38.160]  and sniper SWAT team commander helicopter pilot who helped expose Oklahoma City as a government
[2:13:38.160 --> 2:13:43.200]  bombing to help analyze this for us. I'm in a lot of a bunch of people tonight from nine to midnight.
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:49.040]  There are going to be other great shows all day long for you. Who knows? I might pop in on the
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:52.720]  Midas report. I was Michael Trudeau. He probably won't that. And by four, I'll be charming at the
[2:13:52.720 --> 2:13:59.120]  bit to get back on. But we have very able hosts that will be bringing you the news and information.
[2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:03.280]  I might even have something developed while John's on the air. I might call in if he's gracious,
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:07.280]  have me on to hit some points, but we'll have that with everybody. In fact, I wanted Dave and Joyce.
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:10.160]  I don't know where they're at, but they're doing a great job. I wanted them on.
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:16.720]  I wanted everybody on. The show was for everybody today. We can talk about what's happening here,
[2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:22.640]  this disaster. Let's take some final calls. Who's up next there? I'm sorry. Mark.
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:28.000]  Father Grigorian up in New York. Go ahead, sir. You're on the air.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:41.200]  Yeah. How you do, Alex? I was just watching Fox News and WMS NBC, and they said that the borders
[2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:49.120]  with Canada and the borders with Mexico are now closed. They got two warships and the National
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:56.160]  Guard are on their way to New York. Fighter planes are patrolling the skies over New York.
[2:14:56.160 --> 2:15:04.240]  And you noticed all the war movies we've seen lately? Pearl Harbor, Sneak Attack, The Brotherhood,
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:11.520]  Band of Brothers, all of this getting us ready. And even commentators were saying,
[2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:14.880]  are we getting ready for a war or something? Why all this push?
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:22.240]  Well, I firmly believe, like I said earlier when I spoke with you and Jerry Brownfield,
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:29.520]  that I agree with you guys. I don't think the president needs to look too far to find out who
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:37.040]  was behind this. And it's all been done, like you said, cause something to get us under martial law.
[2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:42.320]  Problem, reaction, solution, only corrupt government stands again. And I know you're a
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:47.040]  listener. How long have I been analyzing this, pleading, begging people to get the word out?
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:50.960]  Well, I've been listening to you now for about a year, and you've been doing it ever since I've
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:55.680]  been listening. Well, I told you folks, and stuff is only going to go downhill from here,
[2:15:55.680 --> 2:16:01.200]  unless we really get bold and have courage and speak out. I mean, do you think any Arab
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:05.440]  country would really do this and want to be turned into a parking lot? If they were going to do that,
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:10.560]  they would have nuked Israel and Iran now has nukes. Syria has nukes. Why wouldn't they go
[2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:17.280]  ahead and do that? No, no, no, no. Bin Laden is a CIA asset. I believe the EU was involved in this.
[2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:22.480]  There is a fissure. There is a tectonic power struggle in the New World Order right now.
[2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:32.480]  Well, I don't believe that this was done by the Arabs. And I myself feel it.
[2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:37.120]  But it's going to feel good to attack and bomb them and to get all the favor going
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:44.400]  during a nationalistic war. During World War I, they hung people that protested the war.
[2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:49.440]  So, I'll be here on the air all the way supporting the war. Don't you worry.
[2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:56.480]  Well, I'd like to see the militias take up arms and really start doing something now.
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:01.680]  And as far as... Well, let me say, I don't want to... We don't know who did this. We don't have
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:06.000]  the details. We know that building was brought down with shape charges. That's even on the news now.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  Did they just fall down like that? They could fall over or pieces could fall off, but not just
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:20.720]  in five seconds. Boom! Well, they said on MSNBC that at about, I think it was 1038,
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:25.760]  a fourth explosion racked the World Trade Center rubble.
[2:17:27.600 --> 2:17:33.840]  438 MSNBC, one of the unexploded bombs. Yeah, they got the unexploded bombs out
[2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:39.440]  in Oklahoma City quite nicely, didn't they? Yeah. All right, sir. I appreciate the call.
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:42.480]  Joan in Florida, you're on the air globally. Welcome to the airwaves.
[2:17:43.200 --> 2:17:46.480]  Alex? Yes. What's today's date?
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:49.840]  9-1-1. Yeah, what does that mean?
[2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:55.040]  Well, I haven't confirmed it, but supposedly in 1980,
[2:17:55.840 --> 2:18:00.960]  President Reagan signed on this date that 9-1-1 be the official emergency number.
[2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:05.440]  Yeah, interesting, isn't it? My daughter sent me off to that. She found it fascinating.
[2:18:05.440 --> 2:18:10.560]  But on the more serious side. Emergency, save us, Seema.
[2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:13.600]  Yeah, emergency, emergency. Yeah, nobody seemed to care about the
[2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:20.000]  four black East German APCs with M-60s mounted firing into 14 houses two weeks ago
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:30.560]  and a server of a Los Angeles. Well, I have a family member that called into my daughter this
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:36.720]  morning. Is that the colonel or the general? No, no. You told me about that guy.
[2:18:36.720 --> 2:18:43.280]  No, this guy's retired. Anybody worked for these subcontractors? And last week,
[2:18:43.920 --> 2:18:48.320]  I believe it was last week or two weeks ago, he was down at Denton, Texas,
[2:18:49.200 --> 2:18:58.240]  working on a new program package with another friend that's retired. And his friend was over at
[2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:03.440]  Washington at the Pentagon. And what they were working on with putting a program together,
[2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:08.320]  a new package for communications with another satellite program.
[2:19:08.320 --> 2:19:12.480]  Yeah, I understand. Joe, we got to jump. We got to jump. Thanks for the call.
[2:19:13.040 --> 2:19:16.720]  I'm almost out of time. Continue to go to infowars.com,
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:24.720]  infowars.net. Don't let this paralyze you. Move forward like a bunch of bees.
[2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:30.800]  Just call into all the talk shows. Tell them to go to infowars.com and click and listen live
[2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:35.920]  for the truth, guerrilla warfare information. Stat Miller will continue with the broadcast
[2:19:35.920 --> 2:19:40.240]  and our local affiliates, other great hosts that don't care the rest of the broadcasting.
[2:19:40.240 --> 2:19:43.600]  Programming will be covering it. And I'll be back tonight from nine to midnight.
[2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:49.920]  The State Department had issued on Friday a worldwide alert regarding Osama bin Laden
[2:19:49.920 --> 2:19:56.560]  and the possible terrorist attacks. All parties were subpoenaed to be on a,
[2:19:57.840 --> 2:20:02.240]  or supposedly on a heightened state of alert. The Lincoln tunnel has been closed and other
[2:20:02.240 --> 2:20:06.880]  New York airports have been closed. Arm jets patrolling Manhattan ready to shoot down other
[2:20:06.880 --> 2:20:12.240]  threads. President Bush has just made a statement saying that we will use the full response of
[2:20:12.240 --> 2:20:16.640]  resources of the federal government to hunt down the people who have perpetrated this act.
[2:20:16.640 --> 2:20:20.320]  And the terrorism against our nation will not stand.
[2:20:22.240 --> 2:20:28.320]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen. After the two planes slammed into the World Trade Center,
[2:20:28.320 --> 2:20:33.600]  they collapsed 45 minutes later from munitions in the bottom, obviously. Of course, the Pentagon
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:38.480]  had a plane crashing to it and part of it burned a large section. Also outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
[2:20:38.480 --> 2:20:43.120]  through international airport, a jet crash and blew up. 1030 U.S. congressional leaders,
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:47.680]  top cabinet officials moved to secure facilities. Another hijacked plane reported 20 minutes
[2:20:47.680 --> 2:20:51.200]  south of Washington, D.C. Never heard what happened there. Second tower north collapses.
[2:20:51.200 --> 2:20:56.160]  1043 hijacked plane crashes south of Pittsburgh. 1045. All federal buildings in D.C. have been
[2:20:56.160 --> 2:21:02.400]  evacuated. 1122 a.m. American Airlines confirms loss of two flights. United Airlines confirms
[2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:07.200]  loss of flight 93 from Newark, New Jersey. General Clark tells CNN Osama bin Laden's
[2:21:07.200 --> 2:21:13.840]  terror organization is only one that has claimed his kind of capability. They don't even have that.
[2:21:13.840 --> 2:21:17.440]  Also, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich appeared on Fox TV and described today's
[2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:21.440]  national emergency as an act of war and said he had no doubt that acts perpetrated today
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:27.280]  were perpetrated by states and power sponsors. He said the acts were on the par with Pearl Harbor.
[2:21:27.280 --> 2:21:33.280]  They're much larger, ladies and gentlemen. This is 10 times bigger than Pearl Harbor. The Pentagon
[2:21:33.280 --> 2:21:39.920]  has been attacked. The two biggest buildings in our country lay in rubble. We've got airports
[2:21:39.920 --> 2:21:46.560]  blowing up. And who stands to gain? Who stands to gain? Who stands to gain from this? Senator
[2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:51.520]  McCain's on TV saying we'll never live the same. Give up our rights. What do we do? We didn't do
[2:21:51.520 --> 2:21:56.080]  anything. We've been telling you to shut down the border. We've been telling you to defend our country.
[2:21:56.080 --> 2:22:04.240]  He gave the Chinese a Panama Canal. Everybody, great job. More powerful shows coming up. And
[2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:08.000]  I'll be back tonight from nine to midnight. Look for me to pop up on other shows. Staten

[2:23:33.440 --> 2:23:39.520]  The American dream has become a nightmare
[2:23:39.520 --> 2:23:48.480]  Times of the time on cardboard on corners and down
[2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:54.560]  There's a cancer called crime in our city
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:01.120]  That an unspoken fear was on our way down
[2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:10.080]  We must take the medical back Put an end to the games and the drugs and the
[2:24:10.080 --> 2:24:16.160]  freedom And the facts and the bad guys Most always go free that is wrong
[2:24:19.200 --> 2:24:24.080]  We need leaders who lead us Not take us and bleed us
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:27.920]  And take all our money and sex Let's go, Mark.
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:32.080]  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is the National Intel Report. I'm your host,
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:36.000]  John Statmiller. We're live. Genesis Communications,
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:43.360]  WWFB 12172 Standard AM Shortwave Broadcast for the time being. Today's date, of course,
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:50.320]  is the 11th of September, 2001. Needless to say, we're probably not going to hear any more
[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:57.840]  Gary Condit stories, John Bonnet Ramsey stories, probably for weeks and maybe even months to come.
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:03.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, what we have witnessed here this morning, starting at about nine o'clock,
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:09.920]  Eastern Standard Time, was terrorism in the United States. But the question is, whom?
[2:25:11.280 --> 2:25:17.440]  Who had to gain from this? It was a well orchestrated and planned event.
[2:25:17.440 --> 2:25:22.240]  Simultaneous actions, not only against the World Trade Center, a few minutes following that. It was
[2:25:22.240 --> 2:25:29.440]  a Pentagon. A few minutes after that, it was a down plane, 80, 70, 80 miles outside of Pittsburgh.
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:38.400]  And it's apparently, according to the some of the House and Ways Committee on the military
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:46.080]  expenditures and funding, that this just proves that our military is too weak, that our intelligence
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:54.080]  and counterintelligence agencies are woefully lacking. And if anybody thinks that any of these
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:26:00.080]  supposed terrorists that hijacked American planes went through the little gates that you and I
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:06.480]  have as traveling passengers in this country have to do, you're sadly mistaken. The situation as it
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:13.040]  stands right now, the Mexican-U.S. border is being shut down. All planes in the United States have
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:22.480]  been grounded. The report I just got is refineries are shutting down as we speak. Nobody knows what
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:28.240]  kind of effect this is going to have on the markets. We're already seeing ramifications of
[2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:36.000]  European markets. The Wall Street gang is down today. And that's following many hits here on
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:41.760]  the financial markets. We do not know at this point if Wall Street opens up tomorrow what exactly is
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:47.280]  going to happen. I'm still trying to get my mind wrapped around this. I have Steve Quayle standing
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:55.120]  by. Steve, are you with me? Hi, John. Steve, horrendous day here in America. And I know you've
[2:26:55.120 --> 2:27:01.600]  been on the phone all morning as I have. What's your thoughts on this, Steve? Well, first of all,
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:06.480]  I think it's really important that people understand that this type of orchestrated
[2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:12.320]  terrorism and deep covered the hijacking of multiple aircraft. And by the way, John, we're
[2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:17.760]  still getting reports that Camp David was hit. I had a call from a young lady who was crying
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:21.760]  for dad with that Camp David. And this is something the network that played down. Obviously,
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:27.360]  for good reason, the military doesn't want to acknowledge it. But I just don't see any reports
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:31.600]  on that. Suffice it to say, a young lady called her dad in the military there, and he said it was
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:35.840]  just devastated. So there's something that people have got to keep their eyes on. Let's face it,
[2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:42.640]  World Trade Center, gone. The Pentagon. Let's face it, that represents the most sophisticated
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:48.160]  military in the world. And as I heard your opening, we don't have a clue. Our military has been so
[2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:54.800]  emasculated what's going on. And I think this will change the entire history, not only of the
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:28:00.000]  world, but the United States. Look, before the markets even opened this morning, when this
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:06.480]  thing first started to unwind, the Dow futures were down 200 points. That would translate John
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:14.080]  most likely into a 600 to 1,000 point drop. London sold off 4%. Now, in Europe, too, most people
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:19.200]  need to understand this. In London specifically, all the financial center and all the major,
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:24.880]  quote, terrorist targets have been evacuated. So what basically I see taking place now is you've
[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:30.720]  got the world financial system that was up until this point really close to being totally
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:37.200]  destabilized. Now you've got the ultimate linchpin being pulled, and I think it's going to be a
[2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:43.680]  comfy, dumpy time in the coming week. Well, Steve, I have said this many times on my broadcast
[2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:50.800]  that I do believe that for martial law to be declared in this country, any actions taken
[2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:56.880]  of robbing us from our constitutional rights of self-protection, confiscation of firearms,
[2:28:57.840 --> 2:29:02.880]  terrorism, and the one thing I heard this morning, and it hasn't been repeated since,
[2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:08.320]  was this operation in New York City. The response to this was called Ark Angel,
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:15.280]  and that the reports I have right now that FEMA was aware of the situation before the first plane
[2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:21.200]  hit in Twin Towers. Now we cannot call up FEMA right now and get a confirmation on that fact,
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:27.520]  but that's some of the information I've got coming in to me. The important thing here is that I
[2:29:27.520 --> 2:29:34.080]  firmly believe that in order for this global, the escalation of the New World Order taking place,
[2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:41.760]  further seat themselves in power and in control. The key emphasis here is on control. I always said
[2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:46.480]  that it would have to come through a financial collapse, and what I didn't count on is it
[2:29:46.480 --> 2:29:55.280]  being exacerbated by a terrorist attack. They went after the financial district here in the
[2:29:55.280 --> 2:30:00.480]  United States. They went right after Wall Street. Yesterday, John, on the program that I have that
[2:30:00.480 --> 2:30:05.440]  follows yours by a couple hours, I was talking about the cyber attack that was going to take
[2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:10.160]  place in the financial market and that these things would be concurrent happenings. In other
[2:30:10.160 --> 2:30:15.840]  words, there would be a financial attack of some kind that would be followed by what I believe is
[2:30:15.840 --> 2:30:19.760]  the Middle East war that's getting ready to break out. Look at the mainstream press now.
[2:30:19.760 --> 2:30:28.240]  Senators are likening this thing to World War II. What did Pearl Harbor do for us that got us into
[2:30:28.240 --> 2:30:34.240]  World War II? If they are using that historic parallel, then I think we've got to recognize
[2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:38.000]  that we are probably going to get into it a big way. By the way, my sources for the record are
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:44.480]  telling me Iran is behind it. Iran funded it. Iran coordinated it. It will be interesting, John, to
[2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:49.680]  see if they try and cover that part of it up as opposed to allowing the chips to fall where they
[2:30:49.680 --> 2:30:56.640]  may, because this is such a horrendous loss of life on the Rudge website. They're talking
[2:30:56.640 --> 2:31:03.440]  somewhere between 40,000 and 100,000 people killed. 40,000 to 100,000.
[2:31:03.440 --> 2:31:09.280]  Well, we do know that the, and it was two airlines, and I find this rather strange that was United
[2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:16.240]  Airlines and American Airlines. They just recently did a merger. I find it odd that these planes,
[2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:20.560]  and by the way, if you've noticed all these flights that were coming out of Dallas or
[2:31:20.560 --> 2:31:25.600]  Dallas Airport or Boston, they were either headed for Los Angeles or San Francisco,
[2:31:25.600 --> 2:31:31.120]  transcontinental flights. But what disturbs me about this, and I've said this before,
[2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:36.080]  and you've done this going to the airport, going through the little checkpoint here, Steve,
[2:31:36.080 --> 2:31:41.760]  that there is no organization that would ever perform a terrorist act. There's going to go
[2:31:41.760 --> 2:31:47.680]  through a metal detector, not to be scanned. I mean, you get uniforms, you get ID tags,
[2:31:47.680 --> 2:31:53.440]  you jump fences, you do whatever you have to do. These people apparently, from all indications so
[2:31:53.440 --> 2:31:58.640]  far, commandeered these aircraft. Now, what's not been clear is how that was accomplished.
[2:31:58.640 --> 2:32:04.400]  John, they can do it a number of ways. For instance, some of these guys have been deep
[2:32:04.400 --> 2:32:08.720]  cover in this country for a number of years. They can work as baggage handlers. They can
[2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:13.440]  work as food prep people. They can work in any number. One of the first things the FBI will do
[2:32:13.440 --> 2:32:18.240]  is they'll run, obviously, background checks on who showed up at work, who is still at work,
[2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:23.680]  who is networked, and they'll go and do their job, which is to find out who did this. But
[2:32:23.680 --> 2:32:28.400]  what they're going to find out is that these were cells independently, I think, orchestrated,
[2:32:28.400 --> 2:32:33.840]  and I think, again, getting back to who has the most to gain by this. Iran has gone on record
[2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:38.880]  year after year on their diatribe that we are the great state and that they themselves
[2:32:38.880 --> 2:32:43.920]  were going to bring us down. Now, that may get lost in the Palestinians taking credit for this,
[2:32:43.920 --> 2:32:49.840]  and Yasser Arafat's condolences being nothing to us or should any American. Here's the guy that
[2:32:49.840 --> 2:32:55.920]  sends little kids out to become martyrs for Allah, and the deal is that all of this terrorism is
[2:32:55.920 --> 2:33:01.200]  orchestrated. Our intelligence community knows who's doing it, and now it's time to strike at it,
[2:33:01.200 --> 2:33:06.800]  and Hezbollah and Hamas have both denied now any involvement in it. Well, that's kind of like
[2:33:06.800 --> 2:33:11.120]  asking, how do you know when a politician is lying? It's when he's addressing a crowd, okay?
[2:33:11.120 --> 2:33:15.040]  But as you know as well as I do, I mean, we're through the looking glass here.
[2:33:15.040 --> 2:33:20.160]  Right? Black is white and white is black. It very well could be that we have organizations out there
[2:33:20.160 --> 2:33:26.160]  that could be set up. There might be an independent action and the known terrorist groups. Now, what
[2:33:26.160 --> 2:33:33.200]  I heard this morning was not Iran. What I heard this morning was actually Afghanistan. Well,
[2:33:33.200 --> 2:33:38.400]  can I tell you who funds Afghanistan? The Iranians. See, here's what you've got to understand, okay?
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:44.480]  You've got a hub on a wheel, okay? And that hub on the wheel has spokes going out to the rim,
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:50.400]  okay? The rim is what makes the action of the wheel be able to go from one position to another.
[2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:55.680]  In my meta, this little illustration I'm trying to share with you, the hub is still what supports
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:01.200]  the spokes that allow the wheel to travel. You follow what I'm saying? And the Taliban and
[2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:08.720]  Afghanistan, listen, the Iranian revolution, if you will, is very much responsible for
[2:34:08.720 --> 2:34:14.320]  orchestrated terrorism, especially in the Middle Eastern world. When I'm saying directly responsible,
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:20.400]  look, everybody is on everybody's payroll in this world. Obviously, the Russians have enough
[2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:27.600]  spies in New York City to know probably who did it, what color shirts they had on it, etc., etc.
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:32.880]  It seems like when we come to this point, we always get our senators, congressmen, politicians
[2:34:32.880 --> 2:34:37.520]  saying, gee, we don't have enough intelligence to know what's going on. I guarantee you, John,
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:42.160]  that if an ordinary man with enough money went and beat the bush, he could find out the name of
[2:34:42.160 --> 2:34:46.800]  the guy that Shusi is wearing and exactly what he had for breakfast. That's how close it is.
[2:34:46.800 --> 2:34:51.440]  If they wanted to find Osama bin Laden, unless this guy would go to the Antarctic,
[2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:58.080]  dig a hole in the snow and pull the snow over him, we could find him. The issue here with Iran,
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:35:03.760]  with the coalition forces, I've always said that this was Herbert Walker Bush's way of
[2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:11.280]  demonstrating the entire planet that the new UN coalition is there. They had ample opportunity
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:20.400]  to go in and go after the Iranian government its seat of power. We did not do that. We kept this
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:27.040]  thing on a slow rolling boil to bring it up later. The thing that bothers me about this, Steve, is
[2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:33.600]  and the indications are that the American intelligence agencies and their counterintelligence,
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:42.720]  the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, which now has 140 some offices around the world, that the indications
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:49.120]  are that they knew something was going to happen. Now, are they turning a blind eye to escalate
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:56.480]  things in order to make a drastic sea change here? Is it just the simple issue of money for
[2:35:56.480 --> 2:36:01.680]  rebuilding the military or to have more funding? John, it's New World Order total takeover.
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:08.160]  There we go. Let me share this with you. Please, there's no contest to what you're saying.
[2:36:08.160 --> 2:36:14.880]  The thing that most people don't understand is foreign policy extension is terrorism.
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:20.240]  You use cutouts, you use different third parties, but the bottom line is somebody always runs a
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:26.080]  terrorist. There's no ideology involved. It's big bucks. They're on somebody's payroll. When
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:33.120]  something like that, a major event like this takes place, somebody tapes somebody to see
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:40.000]  that it took place. I think what people have got to understand is what's going to happen. It's the
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:47.200]  Hegelian dialectic. You basically produce the problem, you solve the problem, and then by
[2:36:47.200 --> 2:36:52.320]  solving the problem, you bring about the change that you want to have occur. That's called synthesis.
[2:36:52.320 --> 2:36:58.240]  So you've got thesis, i.e., the World Trade Center going up, and i.e., the Pentagon, and i.e.,
[2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:04.240]  Camp David, and whatever other places go up. The point being is then you've got the response.
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:08.800]  We've got to find out the punishes, but what's going to happen? This is the first time in history.
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:16.240]  Every plane has been grounded. John, they're talking about bank runs now because I was on
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:24.000]  the internet. I'm just telling you it's on there. I've talked to people in North Carolina,
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:28.480]  I've talked to people in Colorado, Wyoming, and already people are. I'm not saying they should,
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:32.320]  but I'm just saying they're concerned with their money. Greenspan has said he'll provide all the
[2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:39.600]  liquidity possible. But what terror does, it puts the terrorists in control of the situation.
[2:37:39.600 --> 2:37:44.720]  What you are basically saying point blank is we should have been proactive, and now all we can do
[2:37:44.720 --> 2:37:51.040]  is be reactive, and then being reactive will the New World Order crew achieve their goal.
[2:37:51.040 --> 2:37:56.000]  Remember, it's their stated intention to foment World War III. And John, I want to go on record
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:01.120]  as stating that I believe this is the beginning of that. I don't know if it's three days from now
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:06.640]  or three months from now, but the bottom line is once we've got the whole thing in the Middle East
[2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:11.360]  going off, the panic in the United States, all of the things are going to happen here,
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:15.200]  then it's perfect for them to launch everything we've all been talking about and talk about for
[2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:20.400]  the past 10 years. I've watched the news reports, and by the way, anybody that's got cable out there,
[2:38:21.680 --> 2:38:30.560]  the World News Channel. I was getting reports here of the Taliban in Afghanistan. I saw them
[2:38:30.560 --> 2:38:36.000]  denouncing that they knew the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. They had their doubts that
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:44.160]  Osama bin Laden was responsible for this. We've also heard from the former foreign minister,
[2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:52.400]  the Shimon Perez. He's already saying that his country, Israel, is going to give it full support
[2:38:52.400 --> 2:39:08.880]  the United States on an all-out war on terrorism, and his words exactly are that, let me see, we
