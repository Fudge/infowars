[00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:06.389]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.110]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.950]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.410]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.111]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:17.492]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:21.992]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:37.925]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:42.108]  It's already the 20th day of June 2007.
[00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.031]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:56.839]  Israel has now launched airstrikes into Gaza as the tribal warfare there between at least four different factions intensifies.
[00:00:57.483 --> 00:00:57.883]  The U.S.
[00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:01.065]  and Israel have finalized their Iran strike plan.
[00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:03.566]  The question is, will they go ahead with it?
[00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.747]  We'll be talking about that today as well.
[00:01:06.408 --> 00:01:21.456]  And the latest shockwaves from the breaking news here yesterday with the loose change crew, with the final cut that we're producing right now, 9-11 bombshell, WTC security official details explosions inside buildings.
[00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:35.726]  Now they broke the news here yesterday, but then on their own show here on the GCN Radio Network, Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas were challenged by a caller that they were making this up, so they went ahead and started basically leaking who the individual is.
[00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:39.307]  The individual that they've interviewed for the film that will be out in a few months
[00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:46.992]  They're just trying to spare him from the two big bouts of publicity and phone calls and harassment he's going to get.
[00:01:47.012 --> 00:01:50.534]  And he's asked that his name not be released until the film comes out.
[00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:55.578]  But he does know that it's probably impossible to completely contain it.
[00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:57.659]  And he is a public official.
[00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:58.400]  He is well known.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.582]  He was on television several times on 9-11.
[00:02:01.862 --> 00:02:05.185]  He was inside the Office of Emergency Management in Building 7.
[00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:10.197]  And when he was summoned there after the first tower had been hit, even before the second tower got hit.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.461]  He saw still steaming coffee, half-eaten sandwiches.
[00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:15.782]  They were there looking for Giuliani.
[00:02:16.242 --> 00:02:18.402]  He was there with another city official.
[00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:21.403]  And they began to make their way out of the buildings.
[00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:23.944]  The elevator was shut down, wasn't working.
[00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:25.865]  Even the freight elevator wasn't working.
[00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.326]  So they got in the stairwell and heard huge explosions.
[00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.387]  When they came out in the lobby, there were dead bodies everywhere.
[00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:34.528]  Now the official story was, for two years, no one died in the building.
[00:02:34.948 --> 00:02:39.049]  Since then, they had to say, well, we lied to you, but for your own good, we won't say why.
[00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.810]  Some people did die, but we won't say how many.
[00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:42.646]  That's on record.
[00:02:42.786 --> 00:02:44.147]  So this is just confirming that.
[00:02:44.527 --> 00:02:46.127]  Dead bodies strewn all over the place.
[00:02:46.847 --> 00:02:48.408]  And then they're let out.
[00:02:48.448 --> 00:02:50.529]  And this is before the second tower was even hit.
[00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:57.111]  Now we're told that the second tower being hit caused Building 7, later that afternoon, to fall.
[00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:59.711]  We've seen a lot of different disinformation put out there.
[00:03:00.572 --> 00:03:03.092]  So we'll be going over this, Part 2, today.
[00:03:03.552 --> 00:03:06.473]  And also taking your phone calls on that subject.
[00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:08.554]  Some of the big neocon
[00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:23.093]  Websites have now struck back as we knew they would do against Michael Moore, our reporter with WeAreChange.org and Infowars.com a few nights ago at a screening of his film Sicko.
[00:03:25.077 --> 00:03:25.497]  We're good to go.
[00:03:48.363 --> 00:03:54.825]  And then spills his guts about, yeah, all the firefighters I've talked to said they heard explosions, what they thought were bombs going off in the buildings.
[00:03:55.645 --> 00:04:08.348]  Yes, why is the Pentagon not releasing the 80-plus cameras, in Moore's words, the hundred camera shots of the plane supposedly coming in to hit it?
[00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:13.449]  And he went on to talk about how the 9-11 Commission clearly hasn't told us half the truth.
[00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:16.623]  Just amazing revelations from Michael Moore.
[00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:20.888]  And if Michael Moore has a crooked toenail, it is international news.
[00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:35.001]  We'll see if Fox News and CNN are able to contain this huge news that Michael Moore has now gone public for 9-11 Truth and called for a new investigation and said that he is going to be working in the future and looking very closely at 9-11.
[00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:35.502]  Clearly allusions
[00:04:37.183 --> 00:04:39.766]  Uh, foreshadowing for his second Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:42.629]  So we'll talk about that huge news as well.
[00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.454]  The great-grandson of Geronimo wants his skull back from the Bush death cult.
[00:04:47.794 --> 00:04:49.756]  This and a lot more on the other side.
[00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:50.256]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.577 --> 00:05:07.761]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.122 --> 00:05:10.044]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:18.054]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:25.788]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:37.612]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.912 --> 00:05:41.854]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:43.834]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:47.996]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.170]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:09.413]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:14.015]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:23.239]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:27.061]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:32.368]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:32.668 --> 00:06:39.377]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:06:39.884 --> 00:06:40.525]  What about you?
[00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:46.550]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.691]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:49.652]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.902]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[00:07:04.422 --> 00:07:05.543]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:07:05.743 --> 00:07:09.926]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:07:10.506 --> 00:07:15.389]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:22.334]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.772]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:35.900]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.863]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:07:39.943 --> 00:07:46.428]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:07:46.608 --> 00:07:47.649]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:48.789]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[00:07:52.712 --> 00:07:56.754]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[00:07:56.994 --> 00:07:59.355]  That's KenSolar.com.
[00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:08.720]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.321]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.228 --> 00:08:35.418]  A lot of you have probably noticed if you bought a new PC, laptop, or a new Mac laptop, or even a new Mac computer, they're getting smaller and smaller, which is convenient and wonderful.
[00:08:36.118 --> 00:08:39.721]  But at the same time, the monitor itself tends to be the computer.
[00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:41.763]  The computer is inside the monitor.
[00:08:42.323 --> 00:08:50.549]  And the standard, almost every model I've seen, has a built-in microphone and camera in the monitor.
[00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:52.471]  We're right above the monitor.
[00:08:54.792 --> 00:09:05.556]  And I remember reading different technology publications five, six years ago that they were holding in Tokyo, Japan, and Chicago, Illinois, USA.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:24.928]  Where they were saying in the future there's going to be cameras built into your cell phone, cameras built into your computers, cameras built into everything, and we're going to use those cameras to track and trace everything you do, get marketing information, but also for Big Brother to tune into what you're doing.
[00:09:25.728 --> 00:09:34.092]  And then of course it's come out now that the FBI does without warrants routinely use OnStar to dial into your car and listen to what you're saying and doing.
[00:09:35.236 --> 00:09:38.279]  That came out several years after we broke that from internal sources.
[00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:51.757]  Google last year, and their stock shot up when they announced this, said that they're going to use the built-in cameras and microphones, now that are on most computers, even older computers have internal microphones, that they can remotely access.
[00:09:51.777 --> 00:09:52.698]  And they said, don't worry,
[00:09:53.902 --> 00:09:55.524]  We're not going to have a person listening.
[00:09:55.544 --> 00:10:15.138]  We're going to have a computer listening with keyword software to log everything you're saying and then the computer goes through those keywords and creates an algorithm, a psychological profile for you to more accurately target you with advertising while you're surfing on the computer and then also to sell that data profile on you and on your household.
[00:10:15.158 --> 00:10:17.960]  And it said there's a dog barking in the background of your house.
[00:10:18.978 --> 00:10:22.000]  They will use that data to put dog food commercials on your computer screen.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.321]  This is a microphone and cameras watching and listening to you.
[00:10:26.102 --> 00:10:36.306]  They said we are going to know what kind of TV you're watching by the computer logging the types of words being used in the sentences.
[00:10:37.047 --> 00:10:37.447]  Okay?
[00:10:38.147 --> 00:10:45.991]  They said, now understand, this is a microphone and a camera in your house listening to everything you do, tracking everything you do.
[00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:47.792]  If you had a neighbor
[00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:54.952]  Come up to your door and knock on the door and say, hey, I'm going to plant a camera in your house and a microphone and listen to what you're saying and doing.
[00:10:55.912 --> 00:11:00.815]  You would probably physically assault them or at least yell and scream at them and slam the door and call the police.
[00:11:02.171 --> 00:11:06.514]  Especially if you caught them planting a microphone or a camera in your home.
[00:11:06.955 --> 00:11:15.560]  But Google just calmly announces that they're going to be doing this and that we need to go along with this and accept it.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:22.464]  And we wrote a story about it directly from Google's own press release and it got a lot of attention in technology publications.
[00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:28.188]  But we were actually criticized for not liking it and saying it was Big Brother.
[00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:37.351]  Now we have several new Macs in this office and they have cameras built and microphones built because we needed the latest computers.
[00:11:39.212 --> 00:11:42.753]  We covered up the microphone and the cameras with a piece of tape.
[00:11:43.694 --> 00:11:46.195]  But still it's there and you need to consciously think about that.
[00:11:46.535 --> 00:11:48.396]  Why do I raise this today?
[00:11:49.696 --> 00:11:52.738]  I have the Associated Press here in front of me.
[00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:57.465]  And this AP article is posted up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:57.846 --> 00:12:00.270]  We have a link to the story.
[00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:08.322]  And it reads, cameras may watch you take tests online.
[00:12:10.376 --> 00:12:16.960]  New technology will place cameras inside students' homes to ensure that those taking exams online don't cheat.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:28.806]  This fall, Troy University in Alabama will begin rolling out the cameras for many of its approximately 11,000 online students, about a third of whom are at U.S.
[00:12:28.846 --> 00:12:30.547]  military installations around the world.
[00:12:31.047 --> 00:12:38.011]  The device, made by Cambridge Mass-Based Software Secure, is similar to many respects to other online
[00:12:39.966 --> 00:12:41.147]  Test taking software.
[00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:46.231]  It locks down a computer while the test is being taken, preventing students from searching files on the internet.
[00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:55.719]  The latest version also includes fingerprint identification to help ensure the person taking the test isn't a ringer.
[00:12:56.849 --> 00:13:02.134]  But the new development is a small webcam and microphone that is set up where the student takes the exam.
[00:13:02.354 --> 00:13:09.341]  The camera points into a reflective ball which allows it to capture a full 360 degree image.
[00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:11.182]  Now, let's just stop right there.
[00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:19.310]  And I don't want police driving around, or school teachers driving around, or auto mechanics, or doctors, or anybody out there rolling your eyes and laughing at this.
[00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:21.652]  I want you to type it into a search engine.
[00:13:22.446 --> 00:13:28.031]  Houston Police Chief calls for cameras in private homes.
[00:13:29.573 --> 00:13:35.498]  And the Houston Police Chief last year came out and he said, I think that homes need cameras inside of them.
[00:13:37.802 --> 00:13:44.969]  And I remember three years ago Toyota said they're moving because that summer 30-something children died and it will save children.
[00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:45.889]  It's all for the children.
[00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:52.856]  That they want infrared cameras and they have new concept cars that have this.
[00:13:54.117 --> 00:13:56.039]  And these new concept cars
[00:13:57.822 --> 00:14:04.768]  Have a infrared camera in them that is hooked to a cell phone system that wires to the local FEMA command center.
[00:14:04.788 --> 00:14:07.571]  You know it as your local county emergency management center.
[00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:09.092]  It's really a federal control node.
[00:14:09.852 --> 00:14:25.306]  And if there's pressure on the seats, there's pressure gauges, pressure sensors, and the car goes above 99 degrees, they know a person's inside the hot car, and the infrared camera dials in and calls the police, and that flickers up on a screen.
[00:14:26.454 --> 00:14:36.423]  Under the cell phone laws that the Feds got passed in 96, they paid $9 billion to telecommunications companies to put snooping hubs into all the major backbone systems.
[00:14:36.923 --> 00:14:45.050]  That was breaking news the last year and a half about AT&T in San Francisco having all the spy systems on that particular floor.
[00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.331]  That was all put in at 96.
[00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:50.474]  It isn't that the NSA taps in.
[00:14:50.494 --> 00:14:54.638]  The phone companies have whole NSA floors where everything goes through them first.
[00:14:56.385 --> 00:15:07.940]  And it's the same thing here with the millions of federally installed cameras on the street corners that are face scanning, that are also tracking your biometric signature or fingerprint of your walk.
[00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.721]  that are reading your lips and also chronicling that.
[00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:21.489]  Cameras in your computers and inside your computers and in microphones tracking everything you're saying and doing in almost all homes now that have modern computers.
[00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:27.854]  Cameras to watch you take tests in your home with a 360 shot of what's happening inside.
[00:15:28.235 --> 00:15:30.757]  Police chiefs wanting cameras in your homes.
[00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:31.077]  Why?
[00:15:31.117 --> 00:15:32.058]  It'll keep you safe.
[00:15:32.438 --> 00:15:33.339]  Why are you against it?
[00:15:34.489 --> 00:15:46.181]  I remember learning in 1999 AP reported in Michigan that they quietly put cameras inside all the toilet stalls in many of the Michigan rest stops.
[00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:47.783]  That's now gone in nationwide.
[00:15:49.002 --> 00:15:56.408]  They're putting cameras in school bathrooms nationwide, and they're even sharing it on police nets online.
[00:15:56.728 --> 00:15:58.790]  They've been caught criminally distributing that.
[00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:07.576]  Of course, statistically, we know where those type of people that are into that sickness go, so they can get away with their activities, and that is inside the government and the system.
[00:16:08.775 --> 00:16:16.402]  So, the bathrooms are already wired in many areas of the country, inside the nation, in the schools and the rest areas.
[00:16:17.243 --> 00:16:25.130]  Google admits they're using the microphones and cameras to watch and listen to you, with AI computers tracking all that and then chronicling it.
[00:16:26.191 --> 00:16:28.313]  And now, you see, if you want to take a test,
[00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:31.033]  Now, you see, AP is announcing this to you.
[00:16:31.694 --> 00:16:39.842]  I remember eight years ago learning that most public schools... I remember the whole Clinton initiative to put internet in all the schools.
[00:16:40.222 --> 00:16:41.263]  Let's help our children.
[00:16:41.624 --> 00:16:45.728]  Sounded reasonable, but it was federal, so they decided how it was spent.
[00:16:46.188 --> 00:16:50.673]  And most schools from sixth grade on to stop plagiarism
[00:16:51.741 --> 00:17:09.389]  Everything you write is on a computer and it's put into a national database under federal control that's quote quasi-public private and everything your child writes is then scoured by the feds and is being put in databases.
[00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:16.773]  You can go pull that up for yourself and that's been going on for again seven, eight years.
[00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:35.605]  Now, and so when they make the announcement in the AP that, oh, a microphone and a camera are going to watch 360 with people that are taking online tests, guaranteed that data is going to be sold.
[00:17:35.765 --> 00:17:36.546]  Guaranteed.
[00:17:37.428 --> 00:17:39.088]  This is part of a larger federal initiative.
[00:17:39.348 --> 00:17:44.729]  I haven't had time to look at this particular company, but in all the other cases, that's exactly what's happening.
[00:17:45.069 --> 00:17:48.330]  So I challenge everyone to go look at this for yourself.
[00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.350]  See, what happens is it comes out here, it comes out there.
[00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.051]  Oh, the Houston Police Chief wants cameras in private homes.
[00:17:54.411 --> 00:17:55.331]  To keep you safe, of course.
[00:17:55.771 --> 00:18:02.292]  And oh, they want to have a 360 view of everything going on in your house and listen to you while you take tests and it takes over your computer.
[00:18:02.752 --> 00:18:05.753]  This is what the software does to the university.
[00:18:07.074 --> 00:18:12.277]  Which Eisenhower told you was already controlled by the Pentagon and DARPA and the military industrial complex.
[00:18:12.937 --> 00:18:18.260]  And, oh, there's cameras in the school bathrooms and in the classrooms and cameras on the street corners reading your lips.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.241]  I mean, are you starting to get the bigger picture here?
[00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:33.267]  Also, they have federal grants on safe schools and secure schools and BATF programs where they deputize the local sheriff's deputy who's in the middle school year-round.
[00:18:34.845 --> 00:18:41.209]  And with that, they have the children, and we have this in my film, Police State 2, the takeover, the actual documents.
[00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:52.437]  This is happening in thousands of school districts, where not only do they have federally funded spies, literally in the schools, asking the children, what's in your parents' medicine cabinet?
[00:18:52.457 --> 00:18:53.577]  What type of guns do they have?
[00:18:53.798 --> 00:18:56.459]  Do they have magazine clips that look like this?
[00:18:56.499 --> 00:18:57.400]  Are the guns illegal?
[00:18:58.311 --> 00:19:02.799]  Open, Soviet-style, Stasi, Nazi-style, literal big brother.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.606]  They have them write family ledgers every week.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.963]  In thousands of school districts under federal control, and it's about your family.
[00:19:12.383 --> 00:19:13.044]  And they tell you.
[00:19:13.304 --> 00:19:20.829]  In fact, in some of the schools, they have a semester class each year that's taught by a deputized local sheriff's deputy in over a $100,000 grant.
[00:19:20.849 --> 00:19:23.171]  Some of them are as high as $200,000.
[00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:30.136]  And he's there saying, report on your parents, tell us what's going on, what's in the medicine cabinet.
[00:19:30.897 --> 00:19:35.260]  And in these grants, it says they get unfettered access on the playground, at lunch.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.621]  You've got federally
[00:19:37.879 --> 00:19:43.243]  Deputized commissariats in the school cafeterias.
[00:19:43.944 --> 00:19:44.764]  This is hell on earth.
[00:19:44.824 --> 00:19:45.965]  I mean, it's already here.
[00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:47.406]  Big Brother isn't coming.
[00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:48.147]  It's here.
[00:19:48.967 --> 00:19:52.130]  Alright, I'm going to get into some of the other international national news.
[00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.892]  And we're going to have open phones today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:54.912 --> 00:19:54.972]  1-800-259-9231.

[00:21:00.472 --> 00:21:07.517]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.738 --> 00:21:13.581]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.782 --> 00:21:16.524]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:16.564 --> 00:21:17.705]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:19.006 --> 00:21:23.589]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.526 --> 00:21:31.790]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.852]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:35.912 --> 00:21:41.454]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:57.492]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.632 --> 00:22:04.837]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:14.404]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.845 --> 00:22:22.050]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.762 --> 00:22:28.246]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:02.088 --> 00:23:03.889]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:23:03.969 --> 00:23:05.210]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.292]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:08.652 --> 00:23:11.414]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:11.955 --> 00:23:18.699]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:49.059]  That's 877-873-9626.
[00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:29.339]  Welcome back.
[00:24:29.439 --> 00:24:31.300]  Open Phones coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.280]  End of the third hour.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.001]  We're going to have the Loose Change crew back on.
[00:24:36.062 --> 00:24:48.907]  Maybe give you some more details of this huge story they've broken concerning the controlled demolition of Building 7 that began even before the second tower had been struck.
[00:24:51.701 --> 00:24:57.826]  Just recapping and finishing up the point I was making in the last segment, we are in Big Brother Land.
[00:24:57.886 --> 00:24:59.368]  We are inside the New World Order.
[00:24:59.408 --> 00:25:00.689]  We are under surveillance.
[00:25:01.169 --> 00:25:06.053]  Our children are being trained to be prisoners in the public schools and in the private schools and in the system.
[00:25:06.834 --> 00:25:12.378]  Everything is being surveilled and we're being taught that, oh yeah, we want to put a camera in your house to make you safe.
[00:25:12.499 --> 00:25:14.921]  Oh yeah, we're going to watch and track everything you do.
[00:25:14.941 --> 00:25:20.105]  Oh yeah, we're going to do this to verify that you're not cheating.
[00:25:20.638 --> 00:25:23.021]  You notice it's guilty until proven innocence.
[00:25:24.503 --> 00:25:25.685]  That is the opposite.
[00:25:26.105 --> 00:25:31.633]  Guilty until proven innocent is Napoleonic or tyrannical law.
[00:25:31.733 --> 00:25:34.457]  It is not innocent until proven guilty.
[00:25:34.497 --> 00:25:36.379]  And that's how we're being treated everywhere.
[00:25:36.399 --> 00:25:37.581]  And it starts with the
[00:25:38.496 --> 00:25:44.540]  Airlines, where they randomly search people and literally poke and prod and yell at old people.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:55.987]  I've seen folks on walkers who have got oxygen tanks with literally somebody who can't even speak English as the security person poking and jabbing and yelling at them.
[00:25:56.007 --> 00:26:02.672]  I'll never forget seeing a World War II vet in San Francisco who was getting on a plane to fly out to
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.480]  Hawaii for a Pearl Harbor remembrance.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:13.102]  There were a couple of them, and they were literally being harassed by the security people and prodded and yelled at over their oxygen tanks.
[00:26:13.182 --> 00:26:14.382]  Two of them had oxygen tanks.
[00:26:14.402 --> 00:26:16.362]  I mean, one of them looked like he was about to die.
[00:26:16.382 --> 00:26:18.983]  You could tell he probably couldn't even hear the guy that was yelling at him.
[00:26:19.003 --> 00:26:20.563]  He was just staring up at him.
[00:26:21.323 --> 00:26:26.004]  And I mean, I really felt intense feelings of rage when I witnessed that.
[00:26:27.064 --> 00:26:32.425]  And I don't know how we've gone from the land of the free, the home of the brave, to the land of the surveilled sheep.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.321]  And the land of the cowards.
[00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:38.364]  I love America, and I know we're still a good country with great people.
[00:26:38.824 --> 00:26:48.430]  But we've forgotten what made this nation great, and we've also bought into the false political idea that if you give up liberty, you get security.
[00:26:48.831 --> 00:26:51.412]  When you give up liberty, you get tyranny.
[00:26:51.712 --> 00:26:55.515]  And I know that you, the listeners, understand that, but we have to get that message out to people.
[00:26:56.996 --> 00:27:01.219]  The public's been sold, and I was watching Frontline a few weeks ago,
[00:27:02.082 --> 00:27:16.391]  Their new documentary about the NSA spying, as they were bringing forward revelations that we brought out over a decade ago, but at least, you know, better late than never, but they were putting out the false idea that, well, should we give up all of our liberty to be safe?
[00:27:17.151 --> 00:27:18.132]  That's not true!
[00:27:18.472 --> 00:27:20.133]  You give up liberty, you get a Hitler!
[00:27:20.413 --> 00:27:21.314]  You get a Stalin!
[00:27:21.574 --> 00:27:22.355]  You get a Mao!
[00:27:23.215 --> 00:27:24.056]  You get tyranny!
[00:27:24.696 --> 00:27:25.837]  You do not get freedom!
[00:27:26.917 --> 00:27:31.020]  Now, some of the other news that I have here in front of me today,
[00:27:32.282 --> 00:27:40.326]  deals with the different developments in the Middle East.
[00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:44.849]  And people are calling me and emailing me and saying, Alex, you need to talk more about this.
[00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:46.329]  What is there to talk about?
[00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:57.195]  The Palestinians and the Israelis have been warring with each other since David and Goliath.
[00:27:58.702 --> 00:28:10.832]  And they're all related, they're closer than cousins, and it is a sad thing, but ancient tribal enmity and ancient tribal scores
[00:28:12.384 --> 00:28:42.016]  are very hard to get rid of and uh... uh... i mean i can sit here and give you every gory detail of how many one thousand pound bombs the israelis dropped on the gaza strip or what their uh... apache gunship helicopters did or i can talk about how Hamas is running around shooting people on the street and trying to overthrow the elected uh... government uh... there in the west bank the pragmatic government as the israelis call them but it'll it'll be the same report next week or next month
[00:28:43.152 --> 00:28:52.889]  What is important is that the White House has stated that they are planning to
[00:28:54.454 --> 00:28:57.276]  finalize military plans to attack.
[00:28:57.496 --> 00:28:58.156]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:28:58.637 --> 00:29:00.638]  They're not saying they're going to attack.
[00:29:00.998 --> 00:29:07.602]  They're saying they are finalizing the battle plans for an attack and saying they may attack.
[00:29:07.962 --> 00:29:14.246]  And Israel has said they may attack out of the clear blue sky to try to stop Iran's supposed nuclear weapons development.
[00:29:14.666 --> 00:29:22.151]  The CIA's own assessments say that it's at least eight and a half years until Iran can get a device, much less a delivery system.
[00:29:22.191 --> 00:29:23.992]  That is two separate things entirely.
[00:29:24.907 --> 00:29:26.388]  Now, the Israelis say three years.
[00:29:27.129 --> 00:29:36.335]  So, uh, this is more about Iran's oil, and more about Iran going off the dollar to the euro to buy oil, or to sell oil, for those that want to buy it.
[00:29:36.915 --> 00:29:42.079]  And this is more about weapons sales and a larger plan to destabilize the Middle East for hegemonic domination.
[00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:48.683]  We'll finish up with what's really developing in the Middle East and Central Asia when we get back, and go straight to your calls.
[00:29:48.703 --> 00:29:49.063]  Stay with me.
[00:29:52.043 --> 00:29:55.050]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.992 --> 00:29:58.658]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:04.442]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:30:04.902 --> 00:30:07.183]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[00:30:07.483 --> 00:30:10.564]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:30:11.044 --> 00:30:13.204]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:30:13.364 --> 00:30:14.745]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[00:30:15.005 --> 00:30:19.126]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[00:30:19.466 --> 00:30:22.567]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.

[00:31:06.428 --> 00:31:09.351]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:09.691 --> 00:31:12.253]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:12.614 --> 00:31:17.438]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:17.819 --> 00:31:23.184]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:23.504 --> 00:31:26.467]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:31:26.627 --> 00:31:27.187]  We're good to go.

[00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:30.198]  Three and a half years ago, just eight, nine months into the invasion, the second invasion of Iraq, the overthrow, we, of course, broke here on air with our sources out of Europe and Canada that there were already U.S.
[00:33:30.218 --> 00:33:39.746]  Special Forces leading Al-Qaeda forces in attacks on the Iranians there on their western border with eastern Iraq.
[00:33:41.531 --> 00:33:52.619]  And that they were staging destabilization operations, bombing dams, bombing schools, shooting police, attempting to get the Iranians to come over the border.
[00:33:56.428 --> 00:34:15.457]  Our media has been claiming, the controlled corporate media, the defense contractor owned media, has been claiming that Iran is sending fighters over, but now we've got top British generals and Spanish generals and others saying, no, we were over there, there's no weapons coming across from Iran, Iran doesn't want a war, they're trying to de-escalate.
[00:34:15.737 --> 00:34:20.059]  Remember, it was our government that financed Saddam to attack Iran during the 80's.
[00:34:20.911 --> 00:34:26.514]  And gave him the poison gas, gave him the weather reports and the satellite advice on when to spray.
[00:34:26.534 --> 00:34:32.457]  And then demonized Saddam, who was trained by the CIA when he was 18 years old, in 1958.
[00:34:32.857 --> 00:34:35.718]  Helped put him into power in the coup d'etat in 79.
[00:34:36.098 --> 00:34:38.279]  But again, the average American doesn't know this.
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.341]  And so it's important to know the history of what's happened in Iraq.
[00:34:42.361 --> 00:34:43.822]  We're looking at over 3 million dead.
[00:34:45.398 --> 00:34:48.221]  650,000 just in the first three years of the occupation.
[00:34:48.481 --> 00:34:50.843]  We're now four and a half years into the occupation.
[00:34:53.125 --> 00:34:57.269]  600,000 plus dead just in the first three years.
[00:34:57.769 --> 00:35:00.852]  Over 3 million total since the sanctions started in 1990.
[00:35:00.972 --> 00:35:04.415]  We are now almost 17 years into the total siege of Iran.
[00:35:11.613 --> 00:35:23.999]  of Iraq, the total siege of Iraq that has been surrounded and controlled and dominated and bombed on and off every month or so for the last 17 years.
[00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:36.945]  Their water treatment plants, their power plants, their bridges, their universities, anything that had military applications, their science, their technology, their infrastructure.
[00:35:38.544 --> 00:36:04.382]  And so Iran, who had their government, their elected government overthrown in 1953, the dreaded Savak and the Shah put into power, and again I'm not even defending Iran, they're not perfect either, they're literally trying to de-escalate the situation in Iraq, they're being blamed with supplying fighters and military aid to the different factions, and our media
[00:36:05.228 --> 00:36:09.629]  We'll get up on the news and say, oh, Iran's funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:11.009 --> 00:36:15.470]  And then they will say, the Shiite Al-Qaeda fighters.
[00:36:17.291 --> 00:36:20.792]  That's like saying, Superman is Bizarro.
[00:36:21.872 --> 00:36:25.593]  Or that's like saying, Batman is the Penguin, or the Joker.
[00:36:26.833 --> 00:36:34.615]  Shiites are the opposite of the Sunnis, from which you derive these supposed Al-Qaeda organizations.
[00:36:35.225 --> 00:36:36.946]  Which are really globalist CIA puppets.
[00:36:38.027 --> 00:36:39.408]  And you try to explain this, people.
[00:36:39.428 --> 00:36:41.590]  Let me just put it as simply as I can here.
[00:36:43.852 --> 00:36:44.873]  As simply as I can.
[00:36:47.575 --> 00:37:03.427]  The media and the government that manipulates that media knows that even committee chairmen in the Congress, who are running the war funding and much of the policy, even the committee chairmen, multiple committee chairmen on the news, have been asked
[00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:07.920]  What is the difference between a Shia and a Sunni?
[00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:11.142]  And the two main branches of Islam?
[00:37:12.022 --> 00:37:15.643]  And they cannot tell the press that.
[00:37:16.804 --> 00:37:20.085]  Now, if a committee chairman can't, Americans certainly can.
[00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:24.707]  They've had polls where over 90% of Americans don't even know what a Shiite or a Sunni are.
[00:37:24.747 --> 00:37:26.328]  They don't even know that's a Muslim group.
[00:37:27.348 --> 00:37:28.528]  I mean, it's separate.
[00:37:28.548 --> 00:37:29.809]  It's Catholic and Protestant.
[00:37:31.906 --> 00:37:33.207]  There's just no conception.
[00:37:33.547 --> 00:37:51.414]  And so the Pentagon can get up on the news and say the Shiites are running Al-Qaeda operations when the Shiites are the opposite of Al-Qaeda, even if you believe Al-Qaeda exists and isn't some construct of the New World Order.
[00:37:54.435 --> 00:37:55.836]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:37:56.756 --> 00:37:59.177]  So you can't have a real debate with the 22%
[00:38:00.936 --> 00:38:03.278]  In average polls of Americans who are still for the war.
[00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:07.781]  Because they don't know where Iraq is on a map.
[00:38:07.901 --> 00:38:10.643]  They don't know the history of the Babylonians.
[00:38:10.663 --> 00:38:12.724]  They don't know the history of the Persians, the Iranians.
[00:38:13.325 --> 00:38:18.569]  They just know that somewhere over there there's some round people and let's nuke them and turn them into a parking lot.
[00:38:19.769 --> 00:38:21.851]  And it's really an accepted form of racism.
[00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:31.440]  Now, I'm not saying that there aren't Muslim extremists, and there aren't people who do want to kill Westerners, and people who are mad about the occupation of their nations, and who will target civilians.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:32.461]  There are real terrorists.
[00:38:32.721 --> 00:38:33.782]  There are real suicide bombers.
[00:38:34.426 --> 00:38:41.671]  But more than half of the major terror attacks we see, and all the spectacular events, are government-sponsored terror, and we've proven that!
[00:38:41.911 --> 00:38:43.392]  We have declassified U.S.
[00:38:43.432 --> 00:38:49.857]  government documents where they admittedly are staging terror attacks in the Middle East, in Europe, and the United States.
[00:38:50.177 --> 00:38:52.279]  We have attacks they carried out that are declassified.
[00:38:52.499 --> 00:38:59.704]  We have other planning attacks where the government planned it, and they never carried it out, and those have been released, like Operation Northwood.
[00:38:59.944 --> 00:39:02.386]  That was to be blamed, though, on communists.
[00:39:02.626 --> 00:39:04.988]  And then they were going to set up a police state here domestically.
[00:39:05.388 --> 00:39:06.990]  So they've done this over and over again.
[00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:13.935]  Create crises, stage terror attacks, stage horrible events, or provocateur those events as a pretext for war, greater control.
[00:39:14.155 --> 00:39:15.016]  It's the oldest trick on the book.
[00:39:15.056 --> 00:39:23.683]  It's like Hitler firebombing his own Reichstag and then grabbing a poor mentally retarded man, Marinus van der Lubbe, and convicting him and chopping his head off.
[00:39:23.723 --> 00:39:28.267]  And then later at the Nuremberg trials, Hermann Göring bragged that now he had set fire to the Reichstag.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:37.423]  Goering was certainly there in the middle of the night when they caught the naked Marinus van der Leeuw, clearly drugged, rolling around in an alley.
[00:39:38.124 --> 00:39:46.528]  He supposedly had gone from end to end in the Reichstag, the heavily guarded German parliament, the capital, pouring petrol everywhere, gasoline everywhere.
[00:39:47.868 --> 00:39:52.571]  So that's what we're facing, that's what we're dealing with, and think about Iran.
[00:39:54.315 --> 00:39:57.338]  We broke the news here three and a half years ago that U.S.
[00:39:57.358 --> 00:40:06.885]  Special Forces were staging destabilization terror attacks and funding radical, Wahhabist, true Al Qaeda.
[00:40:07.626 --> 00:40:13.551]  True, real Al Qaeda to launch attacks against the Shiite-dominated Iranians.
[00:40:15.385 --> 00:40:25.311]  So understand, Iran is being blamed for being behind Al-Qaeda attacks when Iranian clerics and their system is the opposite of the religious sect that Al-Qaeda comes from.
[00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:29.253]  So A, they're being blamed for carrying out Al-Qaeda attacks.
[00:40:30.354 --> 00:40:39.399]  B, true Al-Qaeda, and this has now been admitted by Cy Hirsch at the New Yorker and even the Associated Press, it's admitted now,
[00:40:40.892 --> 00:40:47.816]  And the US government and the Pentagon and Bush has admitted that destabilization, economically and internally, militarily, is going on.
[00:40:48.236 --> 00:40:59.563]  And yes, special forces troops are inside Iran, very dangerous, reportedly some of them have been killed, but that's all kept quiet, carrying out military operations against Iran.
[00:41:00.883 --> 00:41:08.868]  And Iran is laying there, taking it, not because they're angels, but because they know this is a war provocation to bring them into war.
[00:41:10.988 --> 00:41:14.529]  Now, again, even if you don't want to believe me, listeners, I challenge you.
[00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:34.837]  You're driving along in your car, you're tuned in to KCXL in Kansas City, or WBCR in Tennessee, or one of our affiliates in Ohio, or one of our affiliates in California, a new one here, 1340 AM, Freedom Rings, the next generation of talking needles, California, KTOX, 1340 AM.
[00:41:37.856 --> 00:41:39.417]  You're listening for the first time.
[00:41:39.737 --> 00:41:40.757]  Do not believe me.
[00:41:41.697 --> 00:41:42.418]  Go find out.
[00:41:43.138 --> 00:41:45.599]  Is Iran Shiite dominated?
[00:41:46.139 --> 00:41:46.999]  What is a Shiite?
[00:41:47.279 --> 00:41:50.120]  They believe for you to be a religious, clerical, high-level leader.
[00:41:50.381 --> 00:41:53.022]  You've got to claim lineage back to the Prophet Muhammad.
[00:41:55.222 --> 00:41:58.103]  Versus the Wahhabist out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:41:58.123 --> 00:41:59.484]  And there's sub-sects of each group.
[00:41:59.704 --> 00:42:00.524]  And it is confusing.
[00:42:00.864 --> 00:42:05.266]  But go find out for yourself and find out that Iran is the opposite of Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:05.965 --> 00:42:19.548]  And that Iran fights Al Qaeda, and Iran is now being attacked by admitted, true, organic, real Al Qaeda groups, while being blamed for carrying out Al Qaeda attacks.
[00:42:20.649 --> 00:42:30.111]  It is about as rich as it can get, and it is somewhat complex, but if you go study the politics in the Middle East and Central Asia, you'll find out very, very quickly.
[00:42:30.371 --> 00:42:33.932]  And then you'll watch the news, and they're up there just announcing
[00:42:34.875 --> 00:42:39.057]  Stuff that has no validity and reality on its face.
[00:42:39.357 --> 00:42:51.004]  They know they're lying, they know the public doesn't know the basic players are, and so you're being lied to, you're being conditioned, you're being propagandized.
[00:42:51.904 --> 00:43:01.349]  You can go up to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, our two main websites, and you can see all the literally hundreds of articles that Paul Watson and Steve Watson have written on this subject.
[00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.151]  And so now we stand at the precipice
[00:43:05.419 --> 00:43:05.979]  With the U.S.
[00:43:06.019 --> 00:43:17.722]  and Israel finalizing the Iran strike plan, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert visited Washington yesterday and met with U.S.
[00:43:17.782 --> 00:43:25.344]  President George W. Bush to finalize plans for a joint U.S.-Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.
[00:43:26.505 --> 00:43:31.746]  President Bush hinted that actions against Iran will form the core of their discussion.
[00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:43.571]  I'm sure that we will find some time also to discuss other measures such as the danger of Iran and the threats that come from the President of Iran who talks all the time about the liquidation of the State of Israel.
[00:43:44.311 --> 00:43:53.713]  Something that is totally intolerable and unacceptable, he said, and we have to continue measures taken in order to stop the Iranian efforts to establish unconventional weapons.
[00:43:54.313 --> 00:43:59.374]  Now let's be clear about what Ahmadinejad has said.
[00:44:00.856 --> 00:44:02.017]  Who I'm not defending here.
[00:44:02.077 --> 00:44:04.880]  Government tends to be bad and tyrannical and out of control.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:10.526]  It's just that Iran's a small tyranny compared to the larger globalist tyranny here that we're talking about.
[00:44:12.628 --> 00:44:15.491]  What he said is the Zionist state will be wiped off the map.
[00:44:16.192 --> 00:44:22.198]  And whether you agree with the State of Israel, which is a Zionist state, a middle-east Zionist,
[00:44:24.165 --> 00:44:30.454]  Or whether you disagree with it, we need to politically be honest about the terms being used here.
[00:44:30.815 --> 00:44:34.340]  He said we're going to wipe that government off the map.
[00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:37.625]  Which is a provocative, incendiary statement.
[00:44:38.502 --> 00:44:46.284]  Because it makes him politically popular with the hardliners and helps his government stay in power when the polls are going against him.
[00:44:46.504 --> 00:44:58.747]  The Iranians, the young people, the majority, are sick of Ahmadinejad and they're sick of the clerics and they're sick of the imams and they're tired of being restricted in how they live and what they can do.
[00:44:59.647 --> 00:44:59.967]  Okay?
[00:45:00.287 --> 00:45:01.467]  So this isn't black and white.
[00:45:01.547 --> 00:45:02.648]  We're good, they're bad.
[00:45:02.908 --> 00:45:06.089]  It's out-of-control governments wanting to have wars with each other.
[00:45:06.929 --> 00:45:07.929]  They had a moderate
[00:45:08.855 --> 00:45:19.905]  Extremely pragmatic leader who wanted and let the UN do whatever they wanted, weren't developing any nuclear weapons capabilities and the West didn't want that and threw down the gauntlet and pushed him out of power.
[00:45:20.425 --> 00:45:25.650]  And slapped Iranians in the face and helped bring Ahmadinejad into power.
[00:45:27.632 --> 00:45:33.417]  Again, these are the facts because Washington wants to have a conflict.
[00:45:33.517 --> 00:45:35.459]  The defense contractors want to be able to sell weapons.
[00:45:36.488 --> 00:45:43.534]  Ahmadinejad, he gets more support when he's standing up, quote, against the West and the Great Satan, quote, against the Great Satan.
[00:45:43.834 --> 00:45:49.058]  And so again, this is the complex dance that's going on.
[00:45:49.118 --> 00:45:55.703]  Instead of our media trying to educate the public about the reality, no, it's just there's some bad people that are brown and they got nukes and they want to kill us.
[00:45:55.963 --> 00:45:57.945]  It's like, Saddam had nukes and wanted to kill us.
[00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:01.167]  Alright, I'm going to go ahead and take some calls.
[00:46:01.247 --> 00:46:01.568]  It's just,
[00:46:02.984 --> 00:46:05.465]  It looks like they're gearing up in the next few years.
[00:46:05.585 --> 00:46:08.746]  Israel has said that they are going to strike by the elections.
[00:46:09.206 --> 00:46:11.227]  They have said that we're going to strike by the elections.
[00:46:11.887 --> 00:46:14.368]  Now the question is, will the United States be part of that?
[00:46:14.748 --> 00:46:15.848]  Will they go along with that?
[00:46:16.088 --> 00:46:17.949]  Or is this just more saber-rattling?
[00:46:18.289 --> 00:46:25.671]  We have to take Israel at their word, because they did attack the reactor in the early 80s in Iraq.
[00:46:26.781 --> 00:46:29.362]  And the Iranians are enriching at a higher level.
[00:46:29.742 --> 00:46:32.543]  This could cause a meltdown if they attack the reactor.
[00:46:32.863 --> 00:46:41.586]  It could cause a Chernobyl-type event that areas of the Middle East, Russia, even Western Europe are going to get hit by.
[00:46:42.086 --> 00:46:43.787]  We'll see higher radiation levels here.
[00:46:45.287 --> 00:46:51.129]  Tens of thousands have died from radiation exposure in the surrounding plume area from Chernobyl.
[00:46:51.689 --> 00:46:55.971]  And we have to ask ourselves, do we want to radiate the surrounding nations?
[00:46:58.234 --> 00:47:06.380]  We're talking about what many top strategists, former members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were saying could be the beginning of World War III.
[00:47:08.282 --> 00:47:08.862]  And it's simple.
[00:47:09.283 --> 00:47:10.664]  The Soviet Union has fallen.
[00:47:11.905 --> 00:47:17.109]  We see Putin and Bush trying to resurrect that again as a unifying system.
[00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:24.134]  We see, with the fall of the Soviet Union, they need a new boogeyman.
[00:47:24.154 --> 00:47:25.455]  That's going to be Muslim extremists.
[00:47:26.118 --> 00:47:36.983]  The generals want war, the defense contractors want war, the banks want war, it gets the country further into debt to them, and I just hope Cooler Heads prevail here and we don't let the New World Order carry this out.
[00:47:37.523 --> 00:47:44.727]  Okay, I know that we have loaded phone lines here and we will go to your calls.
[00:47:45.467 --> 00:47:46.648]  I do want to
[00:47:47.833 --> 00:47:56.701]  I want to mention to all of the listeners in Central Texas area, Austin and surrounding suburbs, that I am having an event tonight at Brave New Books.
[00:47:56.721 --> 00:47:59.903]  There's maps up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:59.923 --> 00:48:01.124]  It is on the western end.
[00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:13.275]  It is literally the last building on the west side, the southwest end of the drag off of UT campus, off of Guadalupe in Austin, Texas.
[00:48:14.298 --> 00:48:18.700]  It is right at the corner of Guadalupe and MLK tonight at Brave New Books.
[00:48:19.181 --> 00:48:20.621]  I'm going to be having a book and video signing.
[00:48:20.641 --> 00:48:25.204]  We're going to show a little sneak peek, about 10-15 minutes of my new film in game.
[00:48:25.864 --> 00:48:30.786]  And then of course, tomorrow night, the tickets are almost sold out of this double sneak peek.
[00:48:30.806 --> 00:48:39.831]  I'm going to show 17 minutes plus, 17 new minutes of footage in my new film.
[00:48:43.427 --> 00:48:48.090]  Terror Storm, a special edition that we're releasing next month.
[00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:53.754]  But we're going to show about 30 minutes of that total of the new version of Terror Storm.
[00:48:53.774 --> 00:48:58.537]  Then I'm going to show a little over an hour of the new two-hour film that I've almost completed.
[00:48:58.557 --> 00:48:59.738]  It'll be done in the next month or so.
[00:49:00.218 --> 00:49:04.681]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:49:05.001 --> 00:49:08.844]  I'll be showing that at the Alamo Draft House tomorrow night, 7 to 10.
[00:49:09.064 --> 00:49:10.125]  I'm going to give a speech.
[00:49:11.495 --> 00:49:20.343]  I think that the composer, the musicians that I'm using in Endgame are going to be there playing some music from Terror Storm and Endgame.
[00:49:21.404 --> 00:49:24.948]  This is kind of an impromptu sneak peek we decided to do just a few days ago.
[00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:26.730]  He should be down there.
[00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.211]  So this should be very interesting.
[00:49:28.251 --> 00:49:30.053]  The tickets are going fast.
[00:49:30.513 --> 00:49:33.997]  If you can't go online and buy them at InfoWars.com or PresentPlanet.com,
[00:49:34.897 --> 00:49:43.322]  You can simply go, if you live in Austin, to the Alamo Draft House South Lamar and buy the tickets at the door today and tomorrow.
[00:49:43.702 --> 00:49:45.783]  But it's going to shell out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:46.043 --> 00:49:48.484]  They normally hold 20 or 30 for the hour before.
[00:49:48.504 --> 00:49:51.786]  So if you get in line then, you may be able to buy some at the door.
[00:49:51.826 --> 00:49:56.828]  But they're going to shell 200 tickets and they hold 30 or more, so the theater only holds about 230.
[00:49:57.509 --> 00:50:01.771]  So you can either get there the hour before, or buy them now in line, or go to the door now.
[00:50:02.873 --> 00:50:04.974]  So we've got Alamo Draft Town South Lamar tomorrow.
[00:50:04.994 --> 00:50:07.675]  We're going to break and then I promise we're going to go right to your calls.
[00:50:07.855 --> 00:50:12.917]  Bill, Vincent, Chris, Jeremiah, Paul, many others.
[00:50:12.937 --> 00:50:15.838]  The toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:15.959 --> 00:50:22.121]  There are also new attacks on Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:50:23.021 --> 00:50:26.723]  They now see him as a serious threat so they are trying to dig up dirt and go after him.
[00:50:27.083 --> 00:50:28.864]  They are attacking the Constitutionalists.
[00:50:29.664 --> 00:50:34.167]  Who is now getting a lot of attention and starting to make some major waves.
[00:50:34.688 --> 00:50:36.869]  So we will get into that later in the next hour.
[00:50:37.289 --> 00:50:45.935]  But right now we're going to come back and go to your calls on the geopolitical temperature that's rising in the Middle East.
[00:50:46.784 --> 00:50:49.048]  We'll talk about government-sponsored terror.
[00:50:49.649 --> 00:50:55.539]  We will also get into the Amnesty Bill, the end of the United States, the North American Union.
[00:50:55.559 --> 00:50:58.224]  They're trying to slit the country's throat right now.
[00:50:58.244 --> 00:50:59.166]  We'll discuss that as well.
[00:51:04.901 --> 00:51:10.390]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:18.382]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.065 --> 00:51:26.108]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.528 --> 00:51:37.953]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.253 --> 00:51:41.754]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.214 --> 00:51:44.155]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.475 --> 00:51:48.317]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:51.893]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:51.913 --> 00:52:55.216]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:52:55.456 --> 00:52:57.918]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:16.574]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.735 --> 00:53:21.638]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.838 --> 00:53:30.865]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:53:31.205 --> 00:53:37.209]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[00:53:37.469 --> 00:53:39.991]  Turn your internet on and off with one simple
[00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:40.672]  I think so.
[00:54:25.613 --> 00:54:34.677]  I wish that I could fly, into the sky, so very high, just like a dragonfly.
[00:54:35.897 --> 00:54:44.660]  I'd fly above the trees, over the seas, in all degrees, to anywhere I please.
[00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:56.465]  Welcome back.
[00:54:56.485 --> 00:54:59.327]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:54:59.827 --> 00:55:01.588]  Bill, in Iowa, you're on the air.
[00:55:01.608 --> 00:55:03.208]  Hello.
[00:55:03.809 --> 00:55:04.209]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:04.249 --> 00:55:04.609]  Welcome.
[00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.629]  Welcome.
[00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:06.670]  You're doing a great job.
[00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:08.991]  I had three quick points I wanted to say.
[00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:14.333]  I was over in the Philippines, and when I was there, I noticed they do have all kinds of checkpoints.
[00:55:15.254 --> 00:55:16.534]  Militaries all over that place.
[00:55:17.735 --> 00:55:18.875]  That's how we're going to be living here.
[00:55:18.935 --> 00:55:19.355]  Go ahead.
[00:55:19.896 --> 00:55:22.977]  And the other thing is, my nephew's in the Navy.
[00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:28.294]  And he's told me we have all kinds of Filipinos that are in our military right now.
[00:55:30.456 --> 00:55:39.022]  And then, uh, I had, uh, my credit card was, my bank account was, the number got stolen offline somehow and somebody cleaned out my bank account.
[00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:50.471]  And when I went to the authorities and turned it in, the first thing the cop did was accuse my 10 year old kid, had me bring him into the police station and then told him that
[00:55:51.149 --> 00:55:55.060]  As soon as he found out that it was him, he was going to come out and pick him up and arrest him.
[00:55:56.989 --> 00:55:58.190]  Your ten-year-old child.
[00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:04.793]  Well, yeah, that's why Third World is so corrupt, because people know the police are corrupt, and we're now, that's now starting to happen here.
[00:56:04.813 --> 00:56:12.136]  I mean, I'm blown away by how many cases just locally where I live, where the cops get caught framing innocent people just because it makes their job easy.
[00:56:12.497 --> 00:56:14.197]  Oh, I'm ruining your whole life!
[00:56:14.558 --> 00:56:23.642]  Somebody doesn't resist the cops, and we have video of it, and they charge them with assaulting cops, and people go to prison for ten years, and just for nothing, and it's, oh, I just ruined your life, no problem.
[00:56:24.878 --> 00:56:29.701]  We had the police, again, who I'm not against, but I mean, I can't put up with what they're doing, come up to us.
[00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:32.623]  We were protesting a few weeks ago and just say, if you don't leave, we're going to arrest you.
[00:56:33.043 --> 00:56:33.964]  And I said, it's a free country.
[00:56:34.004 --> 00:56:34.725]  Go ahead and arrest me.
[00:56:34.745 --> 00:56:36.146]  And they said, OK, we're going to arrest you.
[00:56:36.166 --> 00:56:37.106]  And they masked the cops.
[00:56:37.146 --> 00:56:39.848]  And I told them, I'm going to sue you for wrongful arrest.
[00:56:40.328 --> 00:56:42.390]  And they backed off, because I know my rights.
[00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:44.511]  They were there trying to destroy my country.
[00:56:44.951 --> 00:56:46.672]  They were there trying to kill my First Amendment.
[00:56:47.173 --> 00:56:50.435]  America is just more dirt if we don't have the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:56:51.184 --> 00:56:55.686]  And, you know, in New York I've had cops walk up, and I've seen them arrest people for just videotaping.
[00:56:56.446 --> 00:57:01.248]  It's getting worse and worse and worse, but going back to, why is it bad?
[00:57:02.369 --> 00:57:11.993]  Just two nights ago, it was on MSNBC, that Dan Abramson guy was going, what's wrong with legalizing the illegal aliens and making them our military?
[00:57:12.651 --> 00:57:13.472]  What's wrong with that?
[00:57:13.492 --> 00:57:15.975]  What's wrong with having foreigners make up our military?
[00:57:15.995 --> 00:57:24.405]  Because now Americans are learning that over 20% of the ground force in Iraq and the army is predominantly illegal alien Latin Americans who were then legalized.
[00:57:24.866 --> 00:57:29.311]  And that they've now opened even bigger recruiting stations in Mexico City, Manila...
[00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:39.796]  In the Philippines, and that the Pentagon is lobbying for the amnesty bill to then make the majority of the army illegal alien.
[00:57:39.816 --> 00:57:44.419]  I mean, when you have a foreign army that moves in and then becomes your military,
[00:57:45.129 --> 00:57:47.131]  I mean, Stalin couldn't even ask for something that good.
[00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:51.454]  He just released the prisoners and then made them his commissariat enforcers.
[00:57:53.175 --> 00:57:57.879]  Now, in the Soviet Union, they would send troops from one country to another because they would oppress.
[00:57:57.899 --> 00:58:00.100]  So, I mean, it's the oldest trick in the book.
[00:58:00.761 --> 00:58:03.443]  Later, some of the corrupt Caesars and Romans declined.
[00:58:03.883 --> 00:58:04.503]  Well, that's about it.
[00:58:04.603 --> 00:58:06.704]  But we do have Filipinos in the Navy right now.
[00:58:26.761 --> 00:58:28.982]  We're saying Filipino foreigners.
[00:58:29.443 --> 00:58:31.064]  Filipino nationals.
[00:58:31.944 --> 00:58:32.645]  Absolutely, sir.
[00:58:32.685 --> 00:58:35.666]  There's whole army units that are nothing but MS-13.
[00:58:36.207 --> 00:58:37.327]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:40.689]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:46.212]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.987 --> 00:59:02.191]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.812 --> 00:59:03.652]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.393 --> 00:59:05.314]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.334 --> 00:59:09.658]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.138 --> 00:59:14.302]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.563 --> 00:59:21.228]  We are already into the second hour of this live June 20th, 2007 edition.
[00:59:24.256 --> 00:59:31.401]  I'm Alex Jones, and we're going to be going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:59:32.562 --> 00:59:37.665]  Vincent, Chris, Jeremiah, Paul, many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:59:38.146 --> 00:59:39.767]  What are we discussing today?
[00:59:39.907 --> 00:59:41.928]  What are we talking about today?
[00:59:41.948 --> 00:59:45.010]  Well, we talk about every day.
[00:59:45.751 --> 00:59:53.356]  All the different facets and different wrinkles and different layers of the onion that is the New World Order system that we're living under.
[00:59:53.863 --> 00:59:55.264]  The world government that we're living under.
[00:59:55.724 --> 00:59:58.945]  How many Americans know that we're already in a North American Union?
[00:59:59.406 --> 01:00:06.189]  Already being merged with the European Union through fiat, through bureaucratic agreements.
[01:00:06.449 --> 01:00:08.130]  Well, more and more, but not enough.
[01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.470]  We're here to expose that.
[01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:17.114]  We're here to expose the fact that the elites wage war against each other, really as a way to wage war against their domestic populations.
[01:00:17.794 --> 01:00:21.976]  We are now becoming more and more aware that governments stage terror attacks.
[01:00:22.801 --> 01:00:24.543]  As a pretext for control.
[01:00:24.983 --> 01:00:26.985]  To scare their populations into submission.
[01:00:27.305 --> 01:00:28.846]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:00:29.527 --> 01:00:30.587]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:00:30.788 --> 01:00:31.728]  Vincent in Texas.
[01:00:31.748 --> 01:00:32.329]  You're on the air.
[01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:34.611]  Hello Alex.
[01:00:34.991 --> 01:00:35.912]  Yes Vincent, welcome.
[01:00:36.732 --> 01:00:46.460]  I just want to, before I get to my question, I just want to say that I'm calling from Fort Hood and I've made over 100 copies of Martial Law and 100 copies of Terror Storm.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.003]  I've passed them to all my fellow soldiers and about 80%, at least 80%,
[01:00:52.355 --> 01:00:59.200]  I agree with everything that is presented in that video and in TerrorStorm.
[01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:03.103]  And everybody agrees on everything in that video.
[01:01:03.724 --> 01:01:15.613]  And my question to you is that the people who don't agree, I'd have to say the Christians, they say that it's prophesied in the Bible that all this is going to happen.
[01:01:17.228 --> 01:01:18.869]  My question is, how do I counter that?
[01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:22.713]  When they ask me that question, how do I counter them saying... Okay.
[01:01:23.493 --> 01:01:23.833]  Okay.
[01:01:24.634 --> 01:01:38.465]  You're at Fort Hood, you say you've made over 100 copies of Terror Storm, you've given those copies out to people, and about 20% disagree with you, about 80% agree.
[01:01:38.845 --> 01:01:45.571]  First, let's talk about those that agree that most terrorism is government-sponsored, or criminal elements of the government are sponsoring it.
[01:01:46.413 --> 01:01:48.157]  And what is their feedback?
[01:01:48.217 --> 01:01:52.426]  Then we can talk about the 20% that say worshiping Bush is a blood.
[01:01:53.248 --> 01:01:55.072]  We must have nuclear conflagration.
[01:01:56.742 --> 01:01:57.863]  By the way, that's not Christian.
[01:01:57.903 --> 01:01:58.763]  That's not in the Bible.
[01:01:59.003 --> 01:02:00.424]  That's total occultism.
[01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:08.287]  That's simply the government taking over Christianity and using it as a political tool, just like the Mullahs do in Iran with Islam.
[01:02:09.047 --> 01:02:09.988]  But let's go back.
[01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:16.110]  What are the people saying in your unit and others you talk to that agree with TerrorStorm?
[01:02:17.371 --> 01:02:21.032]  Well, the only thing they say is everything in that video makes sense.
[01:02:21.092 --> 01:02:22.673]  Not just TerrorStorm, Marshall as well.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:32.683]  They just say everything makes sense and they agree with everything and there are a few soldiers right now who are thinking twice about reenlisting now that they've seen the videos.
[01:02:34.144 --> 01:02:46.028]  But then it's a catch-22 because then we lose the citizens and instead it's people from the Philippines, Mexico, and the Ukraine who will fire on American citizens, many of them, in order to do so.
[01:02:46.508 --> 01:02:48.288]  Well let me, this is a big subject.
[01:02:49.169 --> 01:02:50.169]  I've been raised a Christian
[01:02:51.229 --> 01:02:56.711]  I've studied the teachings of Jesus Christ, I believe it, and so you can call me a follower of Christ.
[01:02:57.211 --> 01:02:59.772]  But do not call me a modern Christian.
[01:03:00.433 --> 01:03:07.816]  I mean, I watch these pastors like Hagee on TV, and he says, nuke the Middle East, basically kill them all that's of the Lord.
[01:03:07.836 --> 01:03:12.197]  I mean, that's not what Jesus would do, like the bumper sticker reads.
[01:03:13.038 --> 01:03:20.881]  And it's just pure hatred, and what happened is, the private interests that are running and controlling our government,
[01:03:21.733 --> 01:03:23.835]  Aren't they going to try to infiltrate religion?
[01:03:23.935 --> 01:03:24.355]  They have.
[01:03:25.336 --> 01:03:26.557]  When we get back, we'll talk about it.
[01:03:26.617 --> 01:03:27.257]  Okay, stay there.
[01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:28.218]  Stay there, Vincent.
[01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:30.220]  We'll go to Chris, Jeremiah, Paul, everybody else.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:37.525]  But this is a extremely central issue that we are discussing here today.
[01:03:38.546 --> 01:03:43.249]  And so we'll come back and talk about more of this on the other side.
[01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:46.212]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[01:03:46.332 --> 01:03:49.274]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:53.951 --> 01:03:59.193]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:07.415]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:04:07.675 --> 01:04:14.717]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:04:14.957 --> 01:04:15.818]  We're good to go!
[01:04:42.094 --> 01:04:46.095]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:04:49.516 --> 01:04:51.957]  It's here.
[01:04:57.259 --> 01:05:02.040]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.401 --> 01:05:10.023]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:17.783]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.183 --> 01:05:29.608]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.908 --> 01:05:33.470]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:35.811]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.131 --> 01:05:39.993]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.453 --> 01:05:56.396]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:05:56.556 --> 01:06:01.801]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:02.081 --> 01:06:07.366]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:07.786 --> 01:06:08.907]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:09.268 --> 01:06:18.216]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:06:18.576 --> 01:06:20.198]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.
[01:06:20.418 --> 01:06:24.602]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:06:54.006 --> 01:06:56.227]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.788 --> 01:06:59.550]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.667 --> 01:07:25.830]  I've got to look into it, but I'm told there's been some big new developments in the government's propaganda war against the people, trying to shore up the collapsing official 9-11 fable that jet fuel made three buildings collapse, including Building 7 that was not hit by an airplane.
[01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:27.030]  We'll be going over that.
[01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:30.051]  We've got the Loose Change crew joining us in the second half of the third hour.
[01:07:30.491 --> 01:07:37.792]  Right now we're talking to Vincent in Texas, and Vincent in Texas, for the stations that just joined us,
[01:07:38.636 --> 01:07:39.597]  He's out at Fort Hood.
[01:07:39.637 --> 01:07:52.926]  He says he's given out over a hundred copies of my film Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, and that about 80% of the people he's given it to have woken up and said it makes sense that 9-11 was government-sponsored as well as other terror.
[01:07:54.387 --> 01:08:06.336]  But he said that about 20% won't listen to him, that they say they're, quote, Christians, and that it's all ordained and nothing can stop it, and that this war has to happen, and that it's some type of holy war.
[01:08:08.044 --> 01:08:20.418]  And yes, about 80 years ago, the Rockefeller Foundation set up the World Council of Churches, first called the National Council of Churches, and they go on with big money, grants, funding.
[01:08:20.478 --> 01:08:25.784]  Bush's faith-based initiative would violate the First Amendment and have the government fund billions to the churches.
[01:08:26.761 --> 01:08:30.504]  And you watch him on television, on TBN, I mean, it's of the Lord.
[01:08:31.085 --> 01:08:33.727]  We all get to go see Jesus after the nuclear war.
[01:08:34.428 --> 01:08:37.110]  We'll make Jesus come back by nuking everything.
[01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:39.772]  I mean, this is total Jim Jones cult stuff.
[01:08:40.953 --> 01:08:49.501]  And Pastor Hagee stomps around, screaming, you know, calling for total warfare and genocide in the Middle East and nuking everyone.
[01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:55.483]  And I've seen reports that, yeah, there are these knots.
[01:08:55.503 --> 01:08:56.844]  And really, they're not real Christians.
[01:08:57.324 --> 01:09:02.587]  They're cult members on these bases, mainly the officers.
[01:09:03.408 --> 01:09:06.569]  And they're saying, yeah, it's a holy war against Islam.
[01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:11.212]  It's our own crusade against their jihad.
[01:09:11.232 --> 01:09:17.336]  And this war's got to happen with Gog and Magog for the end to happen.
[01:09:17.376 --> 01:09:21.478]  And then they believe Jesus is going to appear and rule in Jerusalem.
[01:09:22.771 --> 01:09:37.271]  Now what you say to him for a religious argument, you go, funny revelations that you say you believe in says that the Antichrist will appear saying he's the Christ and bringing peace in the Middle East and he will be worshipped as Christ first.
[01:09:38.232 --> 01:10:04.669]  Then the war in the Middle East starts, there at the Tigris, Euphrates, and then there's giant worldwide war, and two-thirds of the world population is killed, and the ocean is poisoned with all this, what sounds like genetic engineering, giant red tides, you know, it talks about mountains of fire and plumes and flying, you know, giant bumblebees dropping firebombs, I mean, it's wild stuff!
[01:10:07.555 --> 01:10:11.916]  John the Revelator certainly saw something.
[01:10:12.036 --> 01:10:13.636]  I don't think they had PCP back then.
[01:10:15.877 --> 01:10:31.020]  So off of the Bible itself, and in Daniel and all of it, and the real Christian scholars who really read it say, no, no, no, you're going to have the fake Christians who are going to follow Antichrist and call for world government out of Europe, and that that will happen.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:35.181]  And literally, you tell that to one of these occult Christians, they're not really Christians,
[01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:38.863]  And you show them in the Bible, they'll start going, cannot compute, cannot compute.
[01:10:38.883 --> 01:10:40.164]  Kind of like Robbie the Robot.
[01:10:40.184 --> 01:10:43.025]  You tell him something he can't compute, smoke starts coming out of his ears.
[01:10:43.646 --> 01:10:45.427]  And he's going, cannot compute, cannot compute.
[01:10:45.987 --> 01:10:47.147]  Because you go, well, wait a minute.
[01:10:48.728 --> 01:10:52.750]  And so, they're just cult members.
[01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:54.411]  But listen, they don't even matter.
[01:10:54.911 --> 01:10:58.553]  You've got 70% of the troops a year and a half ago wanting out of Iraq now.
[01:10:59.113 --> 01:11:00.894]  Now polls are coming out that it's over 80%.
[01:11:00.954 --> 01:11:02.735]  A similar number you're seeing you've got at Fort Hood.
[01:11:04.742 --> 01:11:08.704]  So, the 20% thinks they're dragging, and salt-kicking, and streaming to do this.
[01:11:09.085 --> 01:11:12.687]  Like, oh well, yeah, the majority of you don't want the war, but we know best.
[01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:22.352]  I want to take their little power trip away, because I know a lot of the neocon followers who aren't in the military, but at the grassroots, and they say, yeah, you guys don't want the war, but we know best.
[01:11:22.392 --> 01:11:23.473]  President Bush knows best.
[01:11:24.173 --> 01:11:26.034]  Well, don't think you're part of the power structure either.
[01:11:26.535 --> 01:11:28.956]  When it's 10% support in the war, it's going to be ongoing.
[01:11:30.592 --> 01:11:34.976]  Okay, this is the elite, this is the military-industrial complex, and they'll use foreign troops.
[01:11:35.737 --> 01:11:47.067]  I mean, I remember we reported here a year and a half before because Celica Stillo, the head DEA agent for all the Latin American operations who reported here on CIA drug trafficking, eyewitnessed to it.
[01:11:47.924 --> 01:11:59.935]  You know, he told us a year into the war, three years ago, years before it came out in the news, that, oh yes, they've hired all the former death squad commanders and the Latin American military out of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala.
[01:12:00.275 --> 01:12:06.641]  They're paying over a hundred grand apiece, and they're running a lot of the death camps and secret prisons in Iraq and in other countries.
[01:12:07.401 --> 01:12:20.252]  So, a lot of these ghost detainees, enemy combatants, torture flights going into former Eastern Bloc and into Jordan and into Saudi Arabia are allies.
[01:12:21.793 --> 01:12:23.735]  This is not even being run by American troops!
[01:12:24.295 --> 01:12:29.700]  These are death squad commanders that Negroponte, by the way, commanded during the 70s and 80s.
[01:12:30.861 --> 01:12:33.123]  During the 80s, correction, during the 80s.
[01:12:35.515 --> 01:12:36.275]  They're doing it now!
[01:12:36.736 --> 01:12:37.796]  And they're going to run it here!
[01:12:38.197 --> 01:12:56.487]  He told you that Las Vectas, the Mexican paramilitary gangs, are working for the CIA to run hits in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, as far north as Indiana, rocket attacks, journalists being killed on both sides of the border, truck bombs, cars being burned out, and so he kept very small on the news!
[01:12:57.193 --> 01:12:58.334]  So these are their enforcers.
[01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:02.856]  So the good ol' boys are starting to wake up that this war isn't good and they've been scammed.
[01:13:03.096 --> 01:13:05.017]  Yeah, I don't need you good ol' boys!
[01:13:05.597 --> 01:13:07.458]  They got Latin American death squads.
[01:13:07.959 --> 01:13:08.959]  Hundred grand a pop.
[01:13:08.979 --> 01:13:10.240]  And they got Blackwater.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:11.380]  U.S.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:11.961]  mercenaries.
[01:13:11.981 --> 01:13:13.201]  They don't need you anymore.
[01:13:14.122 --> 01:13:20.005]  So that's their response and that's their answer.
[01:13:20.285 --> 01:13:21.826]  But I do want to say this to the military people.
[01:13:21.866 --> 01:13:24.507]  There are folks starting their fourth and fifth tours now in this war.
[01:13:26.548 --> 01:13:29.651]  And remember, they promised the troops would be home in six months in time for Christmas.
[01:13:30.131 --> 01:13:31.132]  And mission accomplished.
[01:13:31.512 --> 01:13:35.596]  But Pentagon declassified documents say they're going to be there for at least 60 years.
[01:13:36.096 --> 01:13:41.821]  They're building, what, 30-plus multi-thousand-person giant embassies.
[01:13:42.081 --> 01:13:46.184]  They're not embassies, they're command bases to carry out the genocide against the Iraqi people.
[01:13:47.586 --> 01:13:48.506]  So it's that simple.
[01:13:50.928 --> 01:13:51.689]  And that's what's happening.
[01:13:52.296 --> 01:13:55.317]  People say they're there for the oil, and then they go, well, as much oil isn't flowing.
[01:13:55.638 --> 01:13:56.838]  That disproves the oil argument.
[01:13:57.178 --> 01:13:57.718]  No, it doesn't.
[01:13:58.259 --> 01:14:03.701]  They were mad at Saddam in 1990 for quote, over-pumping, and OPEC was mad he was driving down the price.
[01:14:03.921 --> 01:14:09.183]  By turning off the oil, or slowing it down, it increases oil prices' artificial scarcity.
[01:14:10.304 --> 01:14:12.905]  Just like we have with diamonds and so many other commodities.
[01:14:14.846 --> 01:14:16.287]  These are monopoly controlled.
[01:14:17.267 --> 01:14:19.268]  OPEC is an oil cartel monopoly.
[01:14:20.606 --> 01:14:22.789]  De Beers is a diamond cartel monopoly.
[01:14:23.069 --> 01:14:25.332]  They have monopolies over the gold, but that's the opposite.
[01:14:25.352 --> 01:14:26.593]  They want to suppress the price there.
[01:14:26.613 --> 01:14:27.975]  This is what they're doing.
[01:14:28.015 --> 01:14:30.598]  So for your Christian friends to go, is lying good?
[01:14:30.638 --> 01:14:32.160]  Who's the father of lies?
[01:14:33.931 --> 01:14:35.432]  Who is the father of lies?
[01:14:35.532 --> 01:14:37.633]  Why did we lie and say we'd be back?
[01:14:37.653 --> 01:14:41.095]  And they'll go, well, Bush didn't know things wouldn't work and we'd be bogged down.
[01:14:41.556 --> 01:14:41.976]  Oh, really?
[01:14:42.016 --> 01:14:53.183]  P-2-O-G, Pentagon's $6 million-a-year program to stimulate real terror attacks and real resistance as a way to widen the conflict and destabilize the whole Middle East into a big vortex black hole that sucks us into World War III.
[01:14:53.363 --> 01:14:54.884]  Here, here's the official Pentagon document.
[01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.325]  Oh, here's a plan where the Pentagon said they'd be there 60 years.
[01:14:59.404 --> 01:15:00.085]  I don't want to see that.
[01:15:00.585 --> 01:15:02.287]  Oh, let me pray.
[01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:04.309]  I mean, they're just cult members, folks.
[01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:07.352]  Just like some suicide bomber in the West Bank is a cult member.
[01:15:08.573 --> 01:15:09.474]  They're fruitcakes.
[01:15:10.535 --> 01:15:12.537]  You talk to them, they're glassy-eyed.
[01:15:13.018 --> 01:15:15.761]  Oh, we must start the nuclear war and make Jesus come.
[01:15:16.001 --> 01:15:17.342]  These people are deadly dangerous.
[01:15:18.463 --> 01:15:20.045]  They got access to the bio-weapons.
[01:15:20.908 --> 01:15:22.469]  They've got access to the nuclear weapons.
[01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:25.471]  They've got access to the neutron weapons.
[01:15:25.852 --> 01:15:29.494]  They've got access, what the Air Force has admitted, they now have antimatter weapons.
[01:15:30.115 --> 01:15:34.398]  We're worried about... Look it up, because they've got antimatter bombs.
[01:15:35.439 --> 01:15:43.205]  Which top scientists and physicists and quantum mechanics and nuclear physicists have said could cause a chain reaction and blow the whole planet or solar system up.
[01:15:43.445 --> 01:15:45.206]  It could create a black hole!
[01:15:46.307 --> 01:15:49.009]  They're just testing it in the superconducting super colliders.
[01:15:49.642 --> 01:15:50.543]  Let's go back to Vincent.
[01:15:50.623 --> 01:15:51.784]  I've got to hurry up here through the calls.
[01:15:51.824 --> 01:15:52.624]  I'm kind of belaboring it.
[01:15:52.864 --> 01:16:00.150]  Does that answer your question, how to approach these deep occultists who have, you know, many would come in my name.
[01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:02.772]  Many would come and lie as false prophets.
[01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:04.533]  But don't.
[01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:05.774]  They love their false prophet.
[01:16:06.134 --> 01:16:11.118]  So when they're getting dropped into the lake of fire, they're going to love it.
[01:16:11.298 --> 01:16:11.899]  Yes, you're right.
[01:16:11.919 --> 01:16:12.619]  You're completely right.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.383]  And I didn't know anything about that Rockefeller and him setting up those churches back in
[01:16:17.904 --> 01:16:19.685]  Back years ago, I'd have to look that up.
[01:16:20.305 --> 01:16:25.187]  Well, also, a lot of these big, top televangelists are on the government payroll or on the Israeli payroll.
[01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:28.348]  The Israelis pay millions publicly to major televangelists.
[01:16:29.688 --> 01:16:31.689]  Foreign governments openly buy off our preachers.
[01:16:32.429 --> 01:16:37.571]  And then I've seen Pastor Hagee say, we must worship Israel and worship the Israeli leadership.
[01:16:37.631 --> 01:16:39.852]  That is the new Christianity, is to worship Israel.
[01:16:41.012 --> 01:16:43.973]  That's the new religion, actual worship on their knees, worshiping Israel.
[01:16:45.433 --> 01:16:52.236]  Not just that, but earlier you mentioned about those embassies, those very, very large embassies that they're building in Iraq.
[01:16:52.256 --> 01:16:52.317]  Yes.
[01:16:52.597 --> 01:16:55.038]  I don't know if you remember me, but I'm the one that gave you those pictures.
[01:16:55.758 --> 01:17:00.581]  The pictures I gave you, I have the pictures in the green zone of the embassies that they're building.
[01:17:00.601 --> 01:17:02.141]  By the way, I gave those to Aaron to post.
[01:17:02.161 --> 01:17:02.902]  Did you ever post those?
[01:17:04.142 --> 01:17:04.663]  I haven't checked.
[01:17:05.023 --> 01:17:07.844]  We just moved into a brand new barracks.
[01:17:07.884 --> 01:17:09.325]  I haven't had the internet within the last month.
[01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:10.913]  I haven't seen anything.
[01:17:10.953 --> 01:17:12.174]  I recently was in Las Vegas.
[01:17:12.234 --> 01:17:12.674]  No, I remember.
[01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:16.978]  I've seen you at several demonstrations and you gave me some of the Iraqi money, which I gave to my son.
[01:17:16.998 --> 01:17:17.818]  He's got it up on his wall.
[01:17:17.878 --> 01:17:19.480]  Thank you, Vincent.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.942]  And I remember you giving me the photos in the Green Zone.
[01:17:22.983 --> 01:17:23.823]  Very interesting stuff.
[01:17:26.585 --> 01:17:27.866]  Yes, and can I say one more thing?
[01:17:29.288 --> 01:17:29.528]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:29.548 --> 01:17:29.848]  Go ahead.
[01:17:30.469 --> 01:17:30.769]  Okay.
[01:17:31.549 --> 01:17:38.435]  I want to say, first I want to say that I am a Hispanic American and I am against illegal anybody coming into
[01:17:40.419 --> 01:17:44.640]  I'm against the North American Union, and I am against the Amnesty Bill.
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:57.626]  But I do want to say that my grandfather, back in the 40s, came to this country, and he joined the Army, and he served this country in World War II, and was honorably discharged, and he lived in this country ever since then.
[01:17:58.486 --> 01:17:59.467]  And he loves this country.
[01:18:01.157 --> 01:18:08.383]  No, no, I fully understand, and I know there are a lot of great foreigners, but with the Mexicans, it's not really the same, because they are Texans, they are Americans.
[01:18:08.523 --> 01:18:10.624]  We're all from the same history, basically.
[01:18:11.205 --> 01:18:15.808]  But what I'm saying, when it's 5-10%, it's one thing, and when it's Mexicans.
[01:18:16.148 --> 01:18:28.177]  But when it's Filipinos, and it's Eastern Bloc, the point is, when our military starts becoming large portions, 25-30% foreigner, don't you agree that's a dangerous trend?
[01:18:28.197 --> 01:18:29.558]  Yes, you are right.
[01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.730]  I agree.
[01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.571]  Absolutely.
[01:18:31.591 --> 01:18:32.511]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:18:32.551 --> 01:18:33.552]  We really appreciate you.
[01:18:35.092 --> 01:18:35.713]  Absolutely.
[01:18:35.773 --> 01:18:42.016]  I mean, listen, if we could educate people from these foreign countries about the American way and about not being against the New World Order, it would be great.
[01:18:42.336 --> 01:18:44.157]  The problem is our whole military is New World Order.
[01:18:44.897 --> 01:18:45.217]  Okay?
[01:18:45.657 --> 01:18:46.978]  I mean, that's my point.
[01:18:47.078 --> 01:18:51.060]  Our own military is lobbying for the end of national sovereignty and the North American Union.
[01:18:53.559 --> 01:18:56.281]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[01:20:14.217 --> 01:20:17.859]  Japanese refiners by 550,000 barrels switching dollar to yen.
[01:20:17.939 --> 01:20:19.380]  Bad news for US currency.
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.761]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[01:20:21.941 --> 01:20:23.342]  Trading equals permanent loss.

[01:22:13.015 --> 01:22:13.375]  I think so.
[01:22:35.037 --> 01:22:36.318]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[01:22:36.338 --> 01:22:37.379]  Let's go ahead and go directly
[01:23:04.817 --> 01:23:05.778]  To Chris in Florida.

[01:23:06.619 --> 01:23:07.019]  Go ahead.
[01:23:07.039 --> 01:23:09.321]  Hi, Alex.
[01:23:10.042 --> 01:23:13.465]  I'm a biology student here at the University of Central Florida.
[01:23:14.226 --> 01:23:17.909]  And I'm really concerned about what's going on here in America right now.
[01:23:18.009 --> 01:23:21.352]  I just wanted to wake up as many people as I can.
[01:23:21.372 --> 01:23:27.197]  And I'm no orator, but I do have some talent in making films and documentaries.
[01:23:27.217 --> 01:23:28.819]  And I was just wondering, in your opinion,
[01:23:29.548 --> 01:23:32.610]  What area of the movement needs more light to be shed on it?
[01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:37.993]  Because there's been so many 9-11 films that I think are really good and have gotten the job done.
[01:23:38.053 --> 01:23:45.977]  I just, I didn't want to regurgitate just another film out there, so I wanted to, I don't know, produce something new, like something to, I don't know, wake more people up.
[01:23:45.997 --> 01:23:59.084]  If I had time, I would do a film on the destruction of language, how they manipulate the semantics of everything, you know, basically what George Orwell, Eric Blair talked about at Ingsoc, kind of the last chapters of that book.
[01:24:00.024 --> 01:24:06.188]  Uh, how they're changing the, how words are used, what they mean, uh, just the propaganda.
[01:24:06.548 --> 01:24:13.193]  I'd make a film, Propaganda of the Police State, showing how all these TV shows are, you know, torturing children is good.
[01:24:13.213 --> 01:24:16.254]  The good guys are really evil, but we're evil for a good reason.
[01:24:16.795 --> 01:24:17.935]  In justifies the means.
[01:24:18.476 --> 01:24:26.521]  I'd also like to make a film, somebody should make a film, about cameras in the school bathrooms, cameras that take your test, an online test.
[01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:30.091]  Uh, police chiefs wanting, you know, what I talked about in the first hour.
[01:24:30.391 --> 01:24:31.451]  Cameras in our homes.
[01:24:31.891 --> 01:24:35.272]  Google admitting they're listening to us and watching us with cameras on our computers.
[01:24:36.112 --> 01:24:38.773]  Uh, just, just, I mean, just how deep we're into the police state.
[01:24:39.233 --> 01:24:45.315]  You know, really a film that gets into all of it, and might be a good way to do it, is just show somebody going through their daily life.
[01:24:46.007 --> 01:24:56.211]  You know, like show maybe one guy who lives in London what a week in his life is like, how much he's under surveillance, and then maybe showing some junior high student who's under surveillance and what their life's like.
[01:24:56.251 --> 01:24:57.892]  Maybe two or three people show their life.
[01:24:58.572 --> 01:25:01.694]  If I had time to actually make documentaries that were in that style, that's what I would do.
[01:25:01.714 --> 01:25:03.875]  Okay, thank you.
[01:25:03.915 --> 01:25:06.736]  I will definitely, I don't know, I'll produce a film like that.
[01:25:07.416 --> 01:25:07.996]  That's what we need.
[01:25:08.016 --> 01:25:09.297]  Alright, thank you.
[01:25:09.557 --> 01:25:10.558]  You bet, good to hear from you.
[01:25:11.118 --> 01:25:13.719]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremiah.
[01:25:14.444 --> 01:25:16.386]  In Missouri, you're on the air, Jeremiah.
[01:25:16.746 --> 01:25:17.326]  Hello, Alex.
[01:25:17.627 --> 01:25:17.887]  Hi.
[01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:21.670]  I've got a couple questions for you on Ed Brown.
[01:25:22.531 --> 01:25:22.811]  Yes.
[01:25:23.131 --> 01:25:24.412]  Press conference on the 18th.
[01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:32.178]  I was kind of upset a little bit by some of these guys on the national news and local news for the area over there.
[01:25:32.639 --> 01:25:34.260]  They were cutting up their words pretty bad.
[01:25:35.021 --> 01:25:40.405]  And I went looking around on the internet to see what I could find for actual footage of it.
[01:25:41.226 --> 01:25:42.767]  And I found two clips of
[01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:46.132]  Ed Brown and his wife, but I didn't find anything over Andy Weaver.
[01:25:46.633 --> 01:25:52.418]  So, uh, I was trying to see if you could find any video clips over Andy Weaver's speech.
[01:25:53.178 --> 01:25:58.203]  Yeah, well, we did our best here to carry it for you, and we did carry the speech.
[01:25:58.263 --> 01:25:59.363]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:59.704 --> 01:26:08.071]  For those that just joined us, Ed Brown and Elaine Brown are in a standoff with federal agents who work for the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[01:26:09.016 --> 01:26:09.376]  I don't know.
[01:26:29.287 --> 01:26:30.608]  Monday was very successful.
[01:26:30.628 --> 01:26:32.850]  It was all over the national news and local news.
[01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:43.778]  And attention, you know, thanks to Randy Weaver going, one of the survivors of the Ruby Ridge Massacre in 1992, did bring a lot of attention to that.
[01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:50.082]  And actually, if you go onto YouTube, and just, I type in my name every day just to see what's up there.
[01:26:50.142 --> 01:26:51.343]  Hundreds of new things usually.
[01:26:51.663 --> 01:26:55.306]  I typed in Alex Jones last night, not to watch all the videos, just to see what had been posted.
[01:26:56.207 --> 01:27:04.450]  And there was a bunch of stuff shot by independent people of the whole press conference if you're looking for that.
[01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:05.590]  Let's cram in one more.
[01:27:06.371 --> 01:27:09.792]  Let's talk to Paul in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:27:09.852 --> 01:27:11.793]  Paul, you're on the air from Canada.
[01:27:12.453 --> 01:27:13.133]  Hello, Alex.
[01:27:13.393 --> 01:27:13.853]  Hello, sir.
[01:27:14.594 --> 01:27:16.594]  I know you're really busy.
[01:27:18.388 --> 01:27:29.650]  I think you missed a few pieces just because I know you're really busy, but did you hear the story in Virginia about the no-touch rule where students in middle school, it's called Kilmer Middle School, they're not allowed to touch each other?
[01:27:30.391 --> 01:27:34.391]  Yes, in fact I have that in the stack, and that goes into this whole police state.
[01:27:35.232 --> 01:27:46.574]  That's part of, they're not allowed to play tag, not allowed to hug, in some areas now they're not allowed to speak throughout the entire day, and we have the official Department of Education documents
[01:27:47.245 --> 01:27:50.366]  From Charlotte Isserby, who was the number two at the Department of Education under Reagan.
[01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:53.447]  And they were openly saying back then, we're going to train them how to be prisoners.
[01:27:53.847 --> 01:27:58.888]  And she has the workbooks, which basically describes the American as a drugged zombie.
[01:27:59.648 --> 01:28:10.131]  And that's what the schools, they are now prisons, barbed wire fences, armored doors, children being searched, cameras in the bathrooms, pushing Ritalin, Prozac, serotonin reuptake inhibitors on them.
[01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:12.431]  When we get back to the next segment, I'll spend a few minutes on that.
[01:28:12.771 --> 01:28:13.772]  Very central issue.
[01:28:15.052 --> 01:28:15.452]  Anything else?
[01:28:16.232 --> 01:28:18.633]  Yeah, I just wanted to mention a couple things.
[01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:22.954]  Also, Chavez has booked a trip to Russia and Iran.
[01:28:22.994 --> 01:28:27.095]  He was just put out today.
[01:28:27.155 --> 01:28:31.256]  Also, Ron Paul was denied to be a part of the Iowa Presidential Forum.
[01:28:31.296 --> 01:28:33.577]  We've got Ron Paul coverage coming up in the next hour.
[01:28:33.617 --> 01:28:34.617]  Yes, very important.
[01:28:35.218 --> 01:28:36.518]  Let me cover that when we get back.
[01:28:36.538 --> 01:28:42.880]  Stay on hold so you can comment on my analysis of the zero tolerance rules.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:43.620]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.142 --> 01:28:47.145]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.065 --> 01:28:50.848]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:58.894]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Deagles, a nuclear medical reporter here on Genesis after Alex Jones 2 to 4 Monday to Friday.
[01:28:59.214 --> 01:29:07.481]  Develop the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[01:29:07.561 --> 01:29:08.882]  Defense tabs block virus
[01:29:08.882 --> 01:29:09.502]  We're good to go!
[01:29:32.692 --> 01:29:35.254]  Stay well and protect your loved ones today!
[01:29:54.215 --> 01:29:56.697]  Do you know that you can go solar for under $1,200 now?
[01:29:57.218 --> 01:29:58.339]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:29:58.539 --> 01:30:02.702]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:30:03.283 --> 01:30:08.187]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:30:08.687 --> 01:30:15.113]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[01:30:15.851 --> 01:30:18.553]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:28.700]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:32.663]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:30:32.723 --> 01:30:39.207]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:30:39.387 --> 01:30:40.428]  Are you ready to go solar?
[01:30:40.628 --> 01:30:41.589]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[01:30:45.492 --> 01:30:49.541]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[01:30:49.802 --> 01:30:52.087]  That's KenSolar.com.
[01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:55.091]  Investments and securities involve the risk of loss.
[01:30:55.211 --> 01:30:57.412]  You may not think of yourself as being affluent.
[01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:59.913]  You may not think of yourself as a high-net-worth investor.
[01:31:00.153 --> 01:31:03.375]  But it doesn't matter what kind of car you drive or the home you live in.
[01:31:03.735 --> 01:31:08.077]  If your investments are $500,000 or more, you're a high-net-worth investor.
[01:31:08.377 --> 01:31:14.460]  And one thing we know about you is that there are eight common mistakes high-net-worth investors can make without even knowing it.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.022]  We're Fisher Investments, and we've put together a special free report just for you.
[01:31:19.463 --> 01:31:22.244]  It's called The 8 Biggest Mistakes Investors Make and How
[01:31:22.244 --> 01:31:22.624]  I think so.
[01:31:37.797 --> 01:31:38.478]  We're good to go.
[01:32:18.777 --> 01:32:26.965]  You know, I always criticize people for not giving folks the big picture, but the picture's so big that it's hard to cover it all.
[01:32:31.531 --> 01:32:46.162]  Now, in the last hour, I was talking about cameras in school bathrooms, barbed wire fences, the students being searched, everyone being told to line up randomly, and police dogs grabbing children's bags and ripping them open, and all these famous cases, but it's happening everywhere.
[01:32:46.422 --> 01:32:49.004]  Thumbs scanning to get school lunches, no cash allowed.
[01:32:49.724 --> 01:32:53.207]  These are the new indoctrination centers, and we have Department of Education documents
[01:32:54.204 --> 01:33:02.409]  Where they admit that they're going to train the new society to live in the new authoritarian police state system in the schools.
[01:33:02.489 --> 01:33:04.110]  That's where the brainwashing is going on.
[01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:07.251]  That's where the big changes are being made.
[01:33:08.392 --> 01:33:20.559]  But a whole other facet isn't just the police and the metal detectors and all the rest of it and they lock the school down every time there's a shooting and the cops don't go in for hours like Virginia or Columbine and let it all intensify.
[01:33:22.831 --> 01:33:34.427]  It's also, they've banned nationwide, in almost every school district we've seen, thousands of them, first it's dodgeball, then it's tag, then it's running at recess, then it's talking loud, then it's talking.
[01:33:35.068 --> 01:33:36.330]  Schools just announced, no talking!
[01:33:37.208 --> 01:33:38.028]  Not at lunch anywhere.
[01:33:38.088 --> 01:33:41.210]  You'll be kicked out of school and then given criminal charges.
[01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:51.574]  In your writing class, if you write the word gun or write about a bank robbery or do anything creative, stuff I did when I was growing up in English, you're arrested or kicked out of school.
[01:33:52.074 --> 01:33:58.697]  You bring a pie to the end of school for your school function and you've got some plastic knives and you're arrested.
[01:33:59.237 --> 01:34:00.918]  Again, training us how to be prisoners.
[01:34:01.378 --> 01:34:05.960]  Well, the Charleston Daily Mail reports, no touch school policy
[01:34:06.747 --> 01:34:08.308]  Restrict hugs and high-fives.
[01:34:09.389 --> 01:34:10.890]  This is not the only school that has these.
[01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:13.712]  No high-fives, no slaps on the backs, no hugs.
[01:34:14.933 --> 01:34:15.273]  Training?
[01:34:15.313 --> 01:34:16.114]  You ought to be prisoners.
[01:34:16.414 --> 01:34:18.155]  And they have shakedowns at these very same schools.
[01:34:18.175 --> 01:34:20.137]  They have you line up and they shake everybody down.
[01:34:20.157 --> 01:34:22.999]  It's for your safety, of course, but the border is wide open.
[01:34:24.223 --> 01:34:25.644]  They release all these violent criminals.
[01:34:25.804 --> 01:34:28.086]  No, it's about training you how to be a slave.
[01:34:28.106 --> 01:34:29.627]  Now, I tried to find it during the break.
[01:34:29.967 --> 01:34:33.169]  It was in several big British newspapers, and I can't remember the exact headline.
[01:34:33.529 --> 01:34:36.271]  Maybe somebody can call in who did see it and knows the headline.
[01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:37.692]  It was in my stack yesterday.
[01:34:37.712 --> 01:34:38.512]  I didn't get to it.
[01:34:39.573 --> 01:34:41.074]  And I've since cleaned my desk off.
[01:34:41.214 --> 01:34:52.121]  But it says that if a woman's had more than two drinks, and even if she says that she wanted to have sexual relations with you in England, that they are going to arrest you.
[01:34:54.093 --> 01:35:01.154]  So, they're pushing the drugs, they're pushing all the anti-depressants and all this stuff on you and this wild culture.
[01:35:01.474 --> 01:35:07.116]  But now, if the woman's been drinking, the government may decide to charge you.
[01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:09.956]  In fact, we did find it here.
[01:35:09.976 --> 01:35:13.277]  Blair de Tuffen Rape Laws.
[01:35:13.337 --> 01:35:15.057]  This is out of the Times of London.
[01:35:15.097 --> 01:35:19.518]  This is not the article I had, but let's go ahead and read some of it.
[01:35:20.269 --> 01:35:30.577]  Now, for the listeners out there, the article I read yesterday out of a British paper said that, well, just more than two drinks and the police will be watching and they're going to decide.
[01:35:32.158 --> 01:35:33.959]  Now, not to mention crazy women.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:45.608]  I mean, look, men do bad things, women do bad things, but statistically I've found women are more predisposed to, that's how they get at people, crazy women, bad women, is to say things.
[01:35:46.609 --> 01:35:48.310]  And say things that haven't happened.
[01:35:50.847 --> 01:35:52.188]  I mean, it's pretty amazing.
[01:35:52.908 --> 01:35:54.348]  And this is going to be hell on earth.
[01:35:54.388 --> 01:35:57.289]  But again, it's about getting everybody into the system.
[01:35:58.310 --> 01:36:00.991]  The average person reading this is like, oh Blair to get tough on rape laws.
[01:36:01.191 --> 01:36:06.172]  He also called for restricting internet free speech last week and regulating internet news and getting rid of free speech.
[01:36:07.193 --> 01:36:13.034]  Men who have sex with drunken women risk being found guilty of rape under proposals to increase conviction rates.
[01:36:13.775 --> 01:36:17.496]  Ministers want to close a legal loophole which results in thousands of cases.
[01:36:18.951 --> 01:36:21.593]  Failing to reach the courts because the victims have been drinking!
[01:36:24.995 --> 01:36:35.021]  Now, folks, how many cases, how many psychologists have documented, psychiatrists, the propensity of people to claim they were raped when they were not?
[01:36:35.321 --> 01:36:37.903]  There certainly is real rape going on, real problems.
[01:36:39.111 --> 01:36:41.992]  You know, people grabbing women off the street and raping them, that stuff goes on.
[01:36:42.012 --> 01:36:49.655]  I mean, remember, four or five years ago, it was longer in New York, all the raping going on in the park, and the cops would do nothing, and it was politically incorrect to talk about it?
[01:36:49.916 --> 01:36:50.796]  I mean, it goes on.
[01:36:51.676 --> 01:36:52.797]  There's a lot of sick men.
[01:36:52.817 --> 01:37:00.120]  I don't know what man would not... That's the whole point of sex, is that you love the woman, and you want her to have enjoyment.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.901]  So that's so alien to me, it just blows my mind.
[01:37:03.801 --> 01:37:05.022]  That's the whole point, is that
[01:37:06.037 --> 01:37:10.141]  I don't want to get off into sexual discussions here, but at least that's what floats my boat.
[01:37:10.241 --> 01:37:14.264]  I'm just going to leave it there.
[01:37:14.645 --> 01:37:19.449]  I can't imagine wanting to rape somebody, but again, for sickos, that's the whole point of the power.
[01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:24.453]  See, this is a hard thing to say is bad, because, well, you're not for rape, are you?
[01:37:24.593 --> 01:37:26.835]  But see, this isn't rape.
[01:37:27.255 --> 01:37:32.339]  Women go out to these meat market bars, they get drunk, and
[01:37:33.974 --> 01:37:36.035]  They go back to their apartment or back to his apartment.
[01:37:36.295 --> 01:37:37.295]  Maybe he gets rough.
[01:37:37.795 --> 01:37:39.936]  Maybe he's mean, tells her to get out of the bed in the morning.
[01:37:40.596 --> 01:37:41.476]  And that's it, folks.
[01:37:41.916 --> 01:37:42.656]  Rape charges.
[01:37:43.416 --> 01:37:46.437]  So, don't do a high-five in school.
[01:37:46.897 --> 01:37:48.218]  Don't talk in many of the schools.
[01:37:48.258 --> 01:37:49.198]  Don't have dodgeball.
[01:37:49.218 --> 01:37:50.038]  Don't play tag.
[01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:53.959]  Everything you do on your test is going to be uploaded for the feds to read it.
[01:37:54.199 --> 01:37:56.320]  For everyone's security and safety with your essays.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.760]  And Blair to Tuffin, rape laws.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:02.161]  And then you read, at present women are deemed to be capable of
[01:38:02.890 --> 01:38:06.873]  Consenting to sex as long as they are not so drunk that they are unconscious.
[01:38:08.074 --> 01:38:20.604]  However, under the proposals which could be announced as early as next month in the Queen's speech, the Queen, see she tells you what's going to happen and then her orders are followed and then her own PR factories tell you she doesn't have any power.
[01:38:21.224 --> 01:38:26.308]  It will be up to juries to decide whether the woman was sober enough to know what she was doing.
[01:38:29.261 --> 01:38:31.503]  But then you read the spin, it's actually worse than that.
[01:38:32.024 --> 01:38:35.347]  Because the juries may be able to decide whether it was right themselves.
[01:38:36.207 --> 01:38:40.351]  The move would have huge implications for couples who have sex after getting drunk.
[01:38:41.072 --> 01:38:46.697]  Oh, see that's... In fact, this is a decent article, guys, but can you find me as many others as you can?
[01:38:46.717 --> 01:38:51.922]  Because the article I had actual had text of the report, and that's the thing I was getting to.
[01:38:52.142 --> 01:38:54.504]  This is a whitewash here that's been found.
[01:38:55.111 --> 01:39:04.375]  Just type RAPE LAWS ENGLAND into Google, and I have to have my staff do it because, again, it's hard to sit here and talk on air and do the Googling at the same time.
[01:39:05.555 --> 01:39:07.596]  But now we're getting into the meat and potatoes here.
[01:39:08.716 --> 01:39:11.357]  They're even saying that couples... Your girlfriend!
[01:39:12.157 --> 01:39:14.738]  Oh, you... Your girlfriend had a few beers!
[01:39:15.559 --> 01:39:16.199]  That's rape!
[01:39:17.559 --> 01:39:19.660]  See, this is what they teach in college now.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.481]  All sex is rape.
[01:39:22.404 --> 01:39:23.105]  Men are evil.
[01:39:23.145 --> 01:39:25.926]  See, it's the government making everything sick, everything good and beautiful.
[01:39:26.166 --> 01:39:29.108]  They want to make it sick to get good people in the system.
[01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:45.878]  The move would have huge implications for couples who have sex, getting drunk, placing a heavy responsibility on men to ensure that women was fully conscious of her actions.
[01:39:46.528 --> 01:39:51.450]  It raises the possibility that even if a woman agreed to sex while drunk, this is what I saw in the other story.
[01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:52.530]  Let me read that again.
[01:39:52.951 --> 01:40:01.554]  It raises the possibility that even if a woman agreed to sex while drunk, a jury could rule that she had been too inebriated to give meaningful consent.
[01:40:02.974 --> 01:40:05.755]  Folks, that's what women do as an excuse to go out.
[01:40:05.816 --> 01:40:06.856]  That's the whole point.
[01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:09.996]  What about the man?
[01:40:10.056 --> 01:40:10.596]  He's drunk.
[01:40:11.057 --> 01:40:18.178]  Maybe he would, you know, that's what women who, I guess, don't meet the norms of society's attractiveness, they go out to the bars.
[01:40:18.198 --> 01:40:20.959]  Because they know the guys have got their beer goggles on.
[01:40:22.759 --> 01:40:23.600]  What about men?
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:29.081]  Can men, see, and all this hyper-political correctness is not about being liberal and helping people.
[01:40:29.141 --> 01:40:31.302]  It's about social engineering and control.
[01:40:31.502 --> 01:40:32.542]  And it's always one-sided.
[01:40:34.878 --> 01:40:49.503]  You see, I get attacked by five illegal aliens, and they break my leg, which happened, and when I was 16 years old, and I was so politically correct, I didn't even know as they were saying gringo, they were kicking me in the face, that it was a racial attack.
[01:40:50.523 --> 01:40:51.404]  And see, I'm an anti-racist.
[01:40:51.484 --> 01:40:52.364]  I go protest the Klan.
[01:40:53.004 --> 01:40:56.985]  But see, it's still politically correct for me to say I've been racially attacked because I'm white.
[01:40:57.266 --> 01:40:57.646]  Same thing.
[01:40:57.826 --> 01:40:58.406]  These men
[01:41:00.047 --> 01:41:04.451]  You know, they go out and get drunk, and women waylay them, and that certainly happens.
[01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:07.373]  Women get drunk men and drag them off and ply them with more shots.
[01:41:07.673 --> 01:41:08.214]  I've seen it!
[01:41:09.895 --> 01:41:11.737]  Well, see, no, that's not rape of him.
[01:41:12.097 --> 01:41:13.699]  It's only rape if it's a woman.
[01:41:13.939 --> 01:41:15.821]  See, this is not... But here it is!
[01:41:16.101 --> 01:41:17.222]  Oh, the woman wanted to have sex!
[01:41:17.262 --> 01:41:17.642]  Doesn't matter.
[01:41:17.802 --> 01:41:20.184]  The government's going to decide to charge you with rape.
[01:41:21.566 --> 01:41:25.169]  So, going back to Paul in Vancouver.
[01:41:25.209 --> 01:41:26.350]  Paul, does that answer your question?
[01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:28.209]  Yes, it does.
[01:41:29.410 --> 01:41:33.011]  I called them up myself and I asked them what kind of police state are they setting up here.
[01:41:33.031 --> 01:41:38.592]  I told them, you know, how unnatural can you be and whatnot.
[01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:39.813]  So yeah, thank you for that, Alex.
[01:41:39.913 --> 01:41:42.373]  And I just had a really quick question, if that's okay.
[01:41:44.174 --> 01:41:46.595]  Would you be for a global republic?
[01:41:47.795 --> 01:41:52.236]  Sort of like a libertarian type of style?
[01:41:52.356 --> 01:41:54.177]  I mean, I'm all for a federation.
[01:41:54.975 --> 01:42:08.583]  I'm all part of people voluntarily having true voting rights, and the international power never being able to supersede any, because in a republic, one little country couldn't be made to go along with the wishes of all the others.
[01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:22.451]  That's not how the United Nations is set up, because there's the argument of, we're seeing, it's been framed as progress to have agrarian hunter-gatherers, well first human society, hunter-gatherers,
[01:42:23.348 --> 01:42:30.435]  Then the first farming agrarian societies, then the first city-states, then nation-states, then empires.
[01:42:30.455 --> 01:42:31.996]  You know, that's the progression.
[01:42:32.056 --> 01:42:34.399]  So, everything's supposedly going to merge.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.122]  The problem is, national sovereignty is a firewall.
[01:42:38.483 --> 01:42:39.664]  It's like bulkheads in a ship.
[01:42:39.944 --> 01:42:44.909]  If you hit an iceberg, the bulkheads are only supposed to flood this area, but the bulkheads block it from flooding the whole ship.
[01:42:45.655 --> 01:42:48.656]  Well, national boundaries, like the U.S.
[01:42:48.676 --> 01:42:51.077]  with Canada and Mexico, those are firewalls.
[01:42:51.097 --> 01:42:56.420]  You get a dictator in Canada, or a dictator in Mexico, he isn't able to take over the U.S.
[01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:59.321]  Or you get a dictator in the U.S., he's not able to take over Mexico.
[01:43:00.161 --> 01:43:04.263]  Or you get a dictator in Germany, the other countries can get together and defeat that.
[01:43:04.303 --> 01:43:05.083]  It's a firewall.
[01:43:05.403 --> 01:43:11.746]  You get a global government, everybody's signed on, a global police force, you get a dictator over the new world parliament, it's over!
[01:43:12.327 --> 01:43:18.749]  There's no resistance, and other great tyrannies have been defeated by other federations getting together and beating it.
[01:43:19.009 --> 01:43:19.889]  Alliances.
[01:43:20.469 --> 01:43:21.930]  So I believe in firewalls.
[01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:23.951]  And that's what national sovereignty is.
[01:43:24.151 --> 01:43:25.491]  That's why we have 50 states.
[01:43:25.791 --> 01:43:27.712]  You used to could run to a state that was freer.
[01:43:28.032 --> 01:43:31.953]  I don't like an income tax here in Massachusetts, so I'm going to go to Texas.
[01:43:32.413 --> 01:43:36.214]  Well, see, they go ahead and get you a tax in Texas, but they just call it something else.
[01:43:36.954 --> 01:43:40.936]  Okay, so that's what the UN wants, is global tax rates set at about 75%.
[01:43:42.651 --> 01:43:43.332]  They say the U.S.
[01:43:43.392 --> 01:43:44.313]  is a tax shelter.
[01:43:44.733 --> 01:43:45.454]  It only half.
[01:43:45.734 --> 01:43:47.196]  Man, I'm paying too many taxes right now.
[01:43:47.216 --> 01:43:48.657]  I could do a lot more if I had my own money.
[01:43:49.378 --> 01:43:49.598]  See?
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:57.266]  So that's why globalism is bad, because the people pushing this form of globalism, it's tyrannical.
[01:43:57.427 --> 01:43:58.748]  China is the model.
[01:43:59.779 --> 01:44:01.800]  China is the model for the UN.
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:02.740]  They get all the awards.
[01:44:03.021 --> 01:44:08.583]  They have forced abortion, infanticide, they mowed down more than 12,000 people conservatively at Tiananmen Square.
[01:44:08.603 --> 01:44:14.486]  I mean, I've got video of peaceful families just sitting there waiting, and the tanks drive right up and just spray machine gun bullets into them.
[01:44:14.946 --> 01:44:17.367]  And then our government doesn't even criticize China anymore?
[01:44:17.387 --> 01:44:18.868]  I appreciate your call.
[01:44:19.828 --> 01:44:22.989]  In fact, speaking of that, I'm going to go to a clip from the CBC from 1989.
[01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.570]  I want you to remember
[01:44:27.802 --> 01:44:34.905]  And these are brave reporters out there, and then we're going to go to a BBC report from on the ground with what happened when we get back from break.
[01:44:34.925 --> 01:44:39.267]  We'll start the next hour, get to more of your calls, Ron Paul developments, and a lot more.
[01:44:39.887 --> 01:44:45.910]  Here is Tiananmen Square to understand the type of tyranny, because the global order uses China as the model.
[01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:47.971]  This is how they'd like us to live here.
[01:44:48.698 --> 01:44:52.320]  The same Chinese internet censorship system is going in here.
[01:44:52.441 --> 01:44:53.561]  It's all happening, folks.
[01:44:53.881 --> 01:44:57.764]  China is the model, and this is the future of America if we don't turn it around.
[01:44:57.784 --> 01:44:58.164]  Here it is.
[01:44:58.865 --> 01:45:00.366]  Good evening, I'm Peter Mansbridge.
[01:45:00.406 --> 01:45:03.448]  Tonight, a special extended edition of Sunday Report.
[01:45:03.668 --> 01:45:08.191]  Extended because of the extraordinary number of major news developments around the world.
[01:45:08.351 --> 01:45:14.735]  We'll get to Iran and the Soviet Union a bit later, but first to China and Beijing, where it's already Monday morning.
[01:45:15.146 --> 01:45:16.467]  The city is in shock.
[01:45:16.687 --> 01:45:18.429]  The military is in control.
[01:45:18.829 --> 01:45:21.492]  But it is control won at a terrifying price.
[01:45:21.932 --> 01:45:25.495]  Their merciless storming of Tiananmen Square has cost many lives.
[01:45:25.896 --> 01:45:33.723]  There is no official count of the dead and wounded, but hospital sources in Beijing say at least 1,400 people were killed.
[01:45:34.143 --> 01:45:35.885]  They say 10,000 were hurt.
[01:45:36.345 --> 01:45:38.207]  And the worst of it may not be over yet.
[01:45:38.707 --> 01:45:43.490]  The Army had a statement a few hours ago, a frightening statement given all that has gone on.
[01:45:44.031 --> 01:45:48.534]  It said the assault on Tiananmen Square was, quote, just an initial victory.
[01:45:48.894 --> 01:45:54.118]  And it said there was still a long fight ahead against, and again we quote, the dregs of society.
[01:45:54.861 --> 01:45:57.242]  On this broadcast, we're going to bring you right up to date.
[01:45:57.662 --> 01:46:00.024]  But to do that, you really have to go back first.
[01:46:00.224 --> 01:46:01.464]  Back 24 hours.
[01:46:01.945 --> 01:46:04.586]  That's when the People's Liberation Army was set loose.
[01:46:04.986 --> 01:46:07.888]  When the rebellion for democracy was literally crushed.
[01:46:08.428 --> 01:46:12.710]  The Chinese government made it impossible to get videotape out of the country until today.
[01:46:13.150 --> 01:46:14.711]  But now the pictures are out.
[01:46:15.151 --> 01:46:18.713]  And Tom Kennedy takes us through them from the Chinese capital.
[01:46:23.226 --> 01:46:27.529]  At dawn this morning, the streets of Beijing looked and sounded like a war zone.
[01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:31.892]  Beijing residents were still challenging the might of the People's Liberation Army.
[01:46:32.273 --> 01:46:33.534]  But it was a hopeless cause.
[01:46:39.338 --> 01:46:42.520]  They were being shot, and everywhere, evidence of the carnage.
[01:46:45.442 --> 01:46:48.825]  Hospitals all over the city were flooded with the wounded and the dead.
[01:46:49.528 --> 01:46:57.272]  Doctors contacted by reporters were exhausted and were saying simply they had no idea how many were killed and they were too busy to talk.
[01:47:05.336 --> 01:47:12.419]  In Tiananmen Square lines of tanks and soldiers were a clear sign that the military had total control of the center of the city.
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:20.146]  Periodic shooting demonstrated that they were not going to move away, and that any further resistance would cost people their lives.
[01:47:23.388 --> 01:47:26.171]  In all, the army put on a vicious show of brute force.
[01:47:27.051 --> 01:47:30.374]  Midnight Beijing time, Saturday night, it began its attack.
[01:47:31.035 --> 01:47:33.737]  It moved towards the square from both the east and the west.
[01:47:42.472 --> 01:47:44.633]  Millions of city residents were out in the streets.
[01:47:45.214 --> 01:47:51.697]  In some places, they succeeded in stopping whole columns, shouting, begging soldiers to go no further.
[01:47:58.561 --> 01:48:01.643]  The People's Army, someone shouted, must not attack the people.
[01:48:02.443 --> 01:48:04.164]  But it was only a temporary respite.
[01:48:04.895 --> 01:48:09.656]  Tanks, armored personnel carriers, and thousands of soldiers blasted their way through.
[01:48:10.436 --> 01:48:19.518]  They were under orders from Supreme Leader Deng Xiaoping, who official sources say gave the order to attack from a hospital bed where he is being treated for cancer.
[01:48:20.718 --> 01:48:24.359]  One million Chinese, Deng said, can be considered a small number.
[01:48:25.239 --> 01:48:27.840]  So soldiers began shooting anyone who got in their way.
[01:48:31.989 --> 01:48:36.911]  On the major routes into the city center, people fought back with the only weapons available to them.
[01:48:36.931 --> 01:48:39.432]  Stones, bricks, Molotov cocktails.
[01:48:42.453 --> 01:48:44.634]  Dozens of armored vehicles were set on fire.
[01:48:44.654 --> 01:48:50.456]  Soldiers who became separated from the main column faced mob justice.
[01:49:04.329 --> 01:49:16.653]  When the army finally arrived in Tiananmen Square, the massacre began.
[01:49:29.707 --> 01:49:31.689]  Thank you very much.
[01:49:56.997 --> 01:50:02.461]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.841 --> 01:50:10.466]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.167 --> 01:50:18.210]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.630 --> 01:50:30.055]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.355 --> 01:50:33.876]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.316 --> 01:50:36.277]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.577 --> 01:50:40.419]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:55.538 --> 01:51:00.041]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:51:00.381 --> 01:51:04.463]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:51:04.763 --> 01:51:05.324]  We listened.
[01:51:05.624 --> 01:51:10.607]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:51:10.887 --> 01:51:11.367]  We listened.
[01:51:11.748 --> 01:51:14.789]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:51:15.210 --> 01:51:15.750]  We listened.
[01:51:16.210 --> 01:51:20.273]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:51:20.653 --> 01:51:21.153]  We listened.
[01:51:21.493 --> 01:51:26.716]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:51:27.137 --> 01:51:28.497]  Again, we listened.
[01:51:28.858 --> 01:51:30.438]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[01:51:30.639 --> 01:51:36.182]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[01:51:54.951 --> 01:51:58.653]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:58.973 --> 01:52:01.195]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[01:52:08.058 --> 01:52:12.981]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.181 --> 01:52:22.126]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:52:55.127 --> 01:53:00.272]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.953 --> 01:53:03.255]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:17.627 --> 01:53:25.613]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to this other news piece from 1989 to understand what we're facing.
[01:53:25.953 --> 01:53:29.295]  Incredibly brave Chinese people just being machine-gunned.
[01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:30.616]  Here it is.
[01:53:33.478 --> 01:53:36.841]  The noise of gunfire rose from all over the center of Peking.
[01:53:37.901 --> 01:53:38.802]  It was unremitting.
[01:53:42.634 --> 01:53:51.237]  On the streets leading down to the main road to Tiananmen Square, curious people stared in disbelief at the glow in the sky, listening to the sound of shots.
[01:53:52.198 --> 01:53:58.760]  Heading down the road was a hazardous business, but hundreds of people cheered as buses were set alight and army trucks caught fire too.
[01:53:58.780 --> 01:54:08.244]  They yelled and shouted, and then as troop lorries were seen moving down the road, there was gunfire from those lorries.
[01:54:12.803 --> 01:54:19.649]  The troops have been firing indiscriminately, but still, there are thousands of people on the streets who will not move back.
[01:54:20.469 --> 01:54:22.691]  The bicycle rickshaw scooped up the injured.
[01:54:22.971 --> 01:54:25.853]  Others were shunted onto bikes and peddled to hospital.
[01:54:26.574 --> 01:54:29.176]  Many were carried away by frantic local residents.
[01:54:30.137 --> 01:54:36.862]  There was confusion and despair among those who could hardly credit that their own army was firing wildly at them.
[01:54:37.811 --> 01:54:42.675]  Many were bystanders, perhaps naive about the savagery of the situation.
[01:54:43.715 --> 01:54:52.161]  Indeed, it was hard at times to grasp that this army was launching into an unarmed civilian population, as if charging into battle.
[01:54:53.222 --> 01:54:58.546]  From Tiananmen Square, the sound of gunfire sounded like a battle, but it was one-sided.
[01:54:58.566 --> 01:55:03.810]  A line of soldiers were strung out, facing a huge crowd.
[01:55:04.568 --> 01:55:06.731]  The air was filled with shouts of fascists!
[01:55:07.592 --> 01:55:08.373]  Stop killing!
[01:55:11.076 --> 01:55:13.019]  We were in the line facing the troops.
[01:55:13.499 --> 01:55:15.662]  They were about 250 yards away.
[01:55:16.403 --> 01:55:20.689]  Young people were singing the Internationale to a background of gunfire.
[01:55:26.245 --> 01:55:32.308]  After hours of shooting and facing a line of troops, the crowd is still here.
[01:55:32.348 --> 01:55:40.892]  They're shouting, stop the killing and down with the government!
[01:55:40.992 --> 01:55:44.995]  A huge volley of shots just as I left the front line caused panic.
[01:55:45.895 --> 01:55:47.816]  The young man in front of me fell dead.
[01:55:48.336 --> 01:55:49.057]  I fell over him.
[01:55:50.003 --> 01:55:51.764]  Two others were killed yards away.
[01:55:52.364 --> 01:55:54.824]  Two more people lay wounded on the ground near me.
[01:55:57.085 --> 01:56:00.486]  Ambulances screamed up to the troop line and were turned away.
[01:56:00.786 --> 01:56:02.166]  They couldn't get to the square.
[01:56:02.607 --> 01:56:04.727]  Two ambulance drivers were shot and injured.
[01:56:06.268 --> 01:56:11.409]  Earlier, we'd been driving at the back of the Forbidden City, the old part of Peking, near the square.
[01:56:11.809 --> 01:56:18.571]  We picked up a woman with a bullet in the head and took her to the nearby children's hospital into a scene of near mayhem.
[01:56:21.582 --> 01:56:24.023]  Casualties were arriving every few seconds.
[01:56:24.603 --> 01:56:28.345]  On bikes, rickshaws, park benches, carried in.
[01:56:29.325 --> 01:56:30.526]  All with gunshot wounds.
[01:56:31.006 --> 01:56:34.988]  Housewives, elderly residents, people shot while sitting in their homes.
[01:56:36.148 --> 01:56:38.029]  The operating theatre was overflowing.
[01:56:38.409 --> 01:56:39.890]  Many of the staff in tears.
[01:56:41.091 --> 01:56:44.872]  In 20 minutes, 40 seriously injured were brought for emergency surgery.
[01:56:45.272 --> 01:56:46.413]  Two were already dead.
[01:56:48.288 --> 01:56:52.732]  In the streets, many came up to us, shaking with anger and disbelief and fear.
[01:56:53.873 --> 01:56:56.735]  Many were terrified, saying there would be retribution.
[01:56:57.175 --> 01:57:01.039]  There was not one voice on the streets which did not express despair and rage.
[01:57:01.059 --> 01:57:02.640]  Tell the world, they said to us.
[01:57:33.689 --> 01:57:38.592]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.203 --> 01:57:50.844]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.524 --> 01:57:52.545]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.285 --> 01:57:54.426]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.046 --> 01:57:55.887]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.628 --> 01:57:57.548]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.189 --> 01:58:02.031]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.371 --> 01:58:06.514]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.857 --> 01:58:13.279]  Well, I tell ya, this broadcast has just blasted past us.
[01:58:13.919 --> 01:58:17.462]  I do have some important Ron Paul news, several pieces of news for you coming up.
[01:58:18.490 --> 01:58:31.754]  We've also got the crew from Lucy Change with a final cut with some big developments on the control demolition of Building 7 and an eyewitness report from inside their own security system.
[01:58:33.074 --> 01:58:35.055]  Right now we're taking your phone calls.
[01:58:36.135 --> 01:58:40.496]  Let's go ahead and talk to Doug in Wisconsin.
[01:58:40.536 --> 01:58:41.357]  Doug, you're on the air.
[01:58:41.417 --> 01:58:41.737]  Welcome.
[01:58:42.477 --> 01:58:43.337]  Hey Alex, what's up?
[01:58:44.117 --> 01:58:45.878]  Doing an international radio show.
[01:58:47.823 --> 01:58:51.785]  I live down the street from a federal district court here in Madison, Wisconsin.
[01:58:51.985 --> 01:58:52.225]  Yes.
[01:58:52.966 --> 01:59:04.270]  And a few days ago, I noticed several hundred, I had to have been at least about 300 of the local Hmong immigrant population from Laos, and they were protesting outside the court.
[01:59:04.891 --> 01:59:14.555]  I don't know if you heard anything about this, but apparently General Vang Pao, who is a big Hmong leader and a former general in the Laotian army,
[01:59:15.134 --> 01:59:20.058]  Who's been fighting the, um, communist coup government in Laos.
[01:59:20.398 --> 01:59:25.322]  He's a well-known narcotics... He's a well-known... He's a well-known narcotics... Put him on hold for just a second.
[01:59:25.342 --> 01:59:26.183]  I'm gonna finish his statement.
[01:59:26.503 --> 01:59:28.124]  Yeah, he's a well-known narcotics trafficker.
[01:59:28.184 --> 01:59:28.865]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[01:59:29.465 --> 01:59:30.046]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:59:30.166 --> 01:59:35.630]  Actually also involved with, uh, helping the CIA to transport opiates using Air America.
[01:59:36.010 --> 01:59:44.157]  And, um, he was recently... Well, his phone just, uh, disconnected there.
[01:59:45.314 --> 01:59:47.655]  I do want to have two-way conversations with you, though, folks.
[01:59:48.335 --> 01:59:50.496]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jenna in Ottawa.
[01:59:50.856 --> 01:59:52.877]  You're on the air from the capital of Canada.
[01:59:54.177 --> 01:59:54.557]  Hello.
[01:59:54.577 --> 01:59:55.698]  Hi, welcome.
[01:59:55.938 --> 01:59:56.498]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:56.518 --> 01:59:57.458]  This is Jenna calling.
[01:59:57.478 --> 02:00:00.519]  I'm actually calling from North Bay, Ontario, though.
[02:00:01.219 --> 02:00:04.240]  The only reason that's relevant is because I have a few things.
[02:00:04.641 --> 02:00:09.902]  In the past four months or so, I've noticed that there's been quite a few changes around here.
[02:00:09.922 --> 02:00:14.584]  There's probably three or four times more police than there were before.
[02:00:15.325 --> 02:00:21.911]  And, like, pretty much on my way to work, I'll see five, six, seven police cars pulling anyone over, like, a lot of action.
[02:00:22.351 --> 02:00:28.336]  And also, our military has started, uh, doing their exercises around town.
[02:00:28.436 --> 02:00:33.981]  Like, they, you'll see them running downtown and jumping over things, and I found that kind of odd.
[02:00:34.141 --> 02:00:37.584]  It's the same thing in Germany, it's the same thing in the U.S., same thing in Canada.
[02:00:37.624 --> 02:00:39.086]  Have you seen my police state films?
[02:00:39.366 --> 02:00:41.788]  Yes, I have, and that's why I'm so concerned about it.
[02:00:42.665 --> 02:00:45.806]  They've been doing takeover martial law drills, and we have the documents.
[02:00:46.586 --> 02:00:48.586]  I mean, I've interviewed police chiefs who they've admitted it to.
[02:00:49.026 --> 02:00:52.967]  See, they have to acclimate us to see Marines and Army and checkpoints.
[02:00:53.367 --> 02:00:57.608]  They have almost tripled the number of police we had just 14 years ago.
[02:00:57.908 --> 02:00:59.009]  They're only adding more.
[02:00:59.329 --> 02:01:03.350]  You'll be out in the middle of nowhere in Montana, and there'll be a cop car every couple miles.
[02:01:03.710 --> 02:01:04.430]  They'll pull you over.
[02:01:04.450 --> 02:01:05.650]  They'll want to search your vehicle.
[02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:06.730]  You'll say, why?
[02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:09.291]  And they'll say, things have changed in America.
[02:01:09.751 --> 02:01:20.961]  And that's why it illustrates what a fraud it is, that the borders are open, they give the illegal aliens amnesty, they don't even have to show who they are to get a new ID and a social security card and to get into the system.
[02:01:20.981 --> 02:01:33.812]  The point is, the war on terror is a war on freedom and a war on our liberties, and they're doing nothing to truly secure this country, and we have the evidence that the major terror attacks are being staged by criminal elements of the military-industrial complex.
[02:01:34.853 --> 02:01:35.914]  Uh, for sure.
[02:01:35.934 --> 02:01:37.035]  So what are they doing in, uh,
[02:01:37.902 --> 02:01:41.124]  In Ontario, which is close enough to Ottawa, what are they doing up in Ontario?
[02:01:41.144 --> 02:01:41.745]  What are you seeing?
[02:01:41.965 --> 02:01:44.246]  Well, we have NORAD here.
[02:01:44.346 --> 02:01:47.248]  This town is very military in the first place.
[02:01:47.749 --> 02:01:51.431]  And you used to be able to go and they would give you a tour of this place.
[02:01:51.491 --> 02:01:54.233]  It's underground and it's pretty high tech.
[02:01:54.393 --> 02:01:55.794]  There's not too many people that have it.
[02:01:56.655 --> 02:02:01.338]  And recently they stopped touring and they told us, it was in the paper, that it had shut down.
[02:02:02.059 --> 02:02:03.240]  They weren't operating anymore.
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:06.143]  Um, and we just found out that it's fully operational.
[02:02:06.323 --> 02:02:07.925]  They're just not letting us see it anymore.
[02:02:08.025 --> 02:02:12.089]  So we, we kind of like, we don't really know what's going on, but it's kind of, it's kind of scary.
[02:02:12.189 --> 02:02:17.674]  And actually all of our police cars have been repainted in the past month and they're black and white now.
[02:02:17.814 --> 02:02:20.857]  Like, like, like you guys have, they all look American.
[02:02:20.897 --> 02:02:24.621]  They used to say OPP and have like little symbols and those are gone.
[02:02:25.638 --> 02:02:33.905]  Well, I remember last year they reported that Texas State Troopers are in Canada teaching your Mounties how to violate people's rights.
[02:02:34.666 --> 02:02:37.248]  I mean, it's just... It's called tyranny.
[02:02:37.268 --> 02:02:39.030]  They're letting us know that, hey, we're corrupt.
[02:02:39.570 --> 02:02:40.671]  There's a new king in town.
[02:02:40.711 --> 02:02:41.752]  His name is Boss Hogg.
[02:02:42.033 --> 02:02:42.953]  Roll over and take it.
[02:02:43.214 --> 02:02:43.554]  Stay there.
[02:02:43.574 --> 02:02:44.415]  I want to hear more about this.
[02:02:47.697 --> 02:02:58.966]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:02:59.186 --> 02:03:07.173]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:03:07.453 --> 02:03:17.121]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals
[02:03:17.681 --> 02:03:19.742]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[02:03:19.802 --> 02:03:20.982]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[02:03:21.002 --> 02:03:22.822]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:03:48.789 --> 02:03:54.253]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.613 --> 02:04:02.258]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.958 --> 02:04:10.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.401 --> 02:04:21.824]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:22.144 --> 02:04:26.066]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:26.106 --> 02:04:28.066]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:28.367 --> 02:04:32.208]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:49.964 --> 02:04:52.607]  But every time I get a pedicure my feet look great!
[02:04:53.397 --> 02:04:54.498]  For a while, anyway.
[02:04:54.518 --> 02:04:58.201]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[02:04:58.821 --> 02:05:01.143]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:05:01.463 --> 02:05:04.966]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:05:05.306 --> 02:05:07.588]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:05:08.128 --> 02:05:08.869]  What's the name again?
[02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:10.230]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:05:10.610 --> 02:05:11.450]  It's CalX.
[02:05:11.731 --> 02:05:11.971]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:05:14.287 --> 02:05:15.947]  What makes Kallax Ointment so different?
[02:05:16.167 --> 02:05:24.489]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:05:25.509 --> 02:05:30.070]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Kallax Ointment.
[02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:39.392]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Wong's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:05:40.132 --> 02:05:41.213]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[02:05:41.253 --> 02:05:41.933]  I'll be right back.
[02:05:42.193 --> 02:05:43.133]  I'm getting some Kallax.
[02:05:45.501 --> 02:05:50.564]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.904 --> 02:05:53.226]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.167 --> 02:05:58.869]  Our world is changing in a big way.
[02:06:02.291 --> 02:06:04.132]  Laws are selectively enforced.
[02:06:05.793 --> 02:06:08.194]  The police state reigns supreme.
[02:06:11.576 --> 02:06:14.658]  If you're an illegal alien, don't have a driver's license, they let you go.
[02:06:16.317 --> 02:06:17.918]  If you're a citizen, I'd throw the book at you.
[02:06:18.579 --> 02:06:19.839]  Thousands of dollars of fines.
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:20.740]  Jail time.
[02:06:22.481 --> 02:06:23.742]  And they just say, that's the way it is.
[02:06:24.042 --> 02:06:25.963]  See, that illustrates it's a fraud.
[02:06:27.044 --> 02:06:27.845]  It's a fraud.
[02:06:29.306 --> 02:06:32.848]  And this is Planet of the Control Freaks.
[02:06:33.828 --> 02:06:45.136]  A world ruled by Control Freaks, each successive generation of them, getting more and more obsessive-compulsive and psychopathic in their implementation of their control.
[02:06:46.596 --> 02:06:47.096]  And they love it!
[02:06:48.317 --> 02:06:49.638]  Don't do high fives in school.
[02:06:49.658 --> 02:06:52.000]  We're going to videotape you in the bathroom.
[02:06:52.401 --> 02:06:54.462]  We're going to search your computers.
[02:06:55.343 --> 02:06:57.044]  We're going to watch everything you do.
[02:06:57.064 --> 02:06:58.765]  We're going to pull you over and search your car.
[02:06:59.386 --> 02:07:05.170]  But my God, everything the government does is going to be secret, because we're keeping you safe from Al-Ci-Ada.
[02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:06.291]  I mean Al-Qaeda.
[02:07:07.152 --> 02:07:10.074]  Going back to Jenna, who's calling from Ontario, Canada.
[02:07:10.875 --> 02:07:12.416]  So you said the military just does drills?
[02:07:12.456 --> 02:07:13.617]  You see them out on the streets now, huh?
[02:07:14.150 --> 02:07:14.510]  Everywhere.
[02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:15.610]  Absolutely everywhere.
[02:07:15.630 --> 02:07:20.851]  I've actually phoned the base more than once now to address chemtrails.
[02:07:22.592 --> 02:07:23.692]  They have a script.
[02:07:24.092 --> 02:07:25.832]  They say word for word every time I call.
[02:07:25.872 --> 02:07:27.692]  It can be three different people I talk to.
[02:07:29.053 --> 02:07:30.813]  They say the exact same thing every time.
[02:07:31.713 --> 02:07:32.713]  None of it's true, of course.
[02:07:32.733 --> 02:07:33.393]  What do they say?
[02:07:33.433 --> 02:07:37.454]  We're here to simply support local community efforts.
[02:07:38.274 --> 02:07:39.234]  We're here to love you.
[02:07:39.274 --> 02:07:40.435]  We care about you.
[02:07:40.455 --> 02:07:42.015]  What's wrong there, ma'am?
[02:07:43.277 --> 02:07:44.097]  Yeah, it's horrible.
[02:07:44.177 --> 02:07:44.657]  It's horrible.
[02:07:44.677 --> 02:07:46.818]  We feel like we're on lockdown big time around here.
[02:07:46.838 --> 02:07:51.980]  And so you say now you see just many more police just feeding on everyone?
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:53.340]  Oh, it's horrible.
[02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:54.141]  They're everywhere.
[02:07:54.321 --> 02:07:54.841]  Everywhere you look.
[02:07:54.861 --> 02:07:55.901]  And this is a small city.
[02:07:55.921 --> 02:07:57.642]  We've only got 60,000 people.
[02:07:57.702 --> 02:07:58.622]  It's cottage country.
[02:07:58.662 --> 02:08:00.343]  Like, mostly seniors here.
[02:08:00.383 --> 02:08:03.544]  So, I just... So, where specifically?
[02:08:03.584 --> 02:08:04.724]  What town are you specifically in?
[02:08:05.004 --> 02:08:06.085]  North Bay, Ontario.
[02:08:06.105 --> 02:08:07.405]  Okay, so you're in a suburb.
[02:08:09.013 --> 02:08:11.254]  You don't feel good with the men in black uniforms?
[02:08:11.274 --> 02:08:12.954]  No, I'm very uncomfortable.
[02:08:12.994 --> 02:08:16.796]  I'm thinking of moving actually, and I was just wondering, like, is it like this everywhere?
[02:08:16.816 --> 02:08:16.876]  Yes.
[02:08:16.896 --> 02:08:18.857]  Or is it just because it's a military town?
[02:08:18.897 --> 02:08:21.498]  Oh, it's like this in Africa, Latin America.
[02:08:22.098 --> 02:08:24.459]  We're the last to fall, and we're going to fall very hard.
[02:08:24.479 --> 02:08:34.544]  I mean, look, you can count on two hands how many governments have been quasi-free.
[02:08:35.382 --> 02:08:36.604]  ...had any semblance of freedom.
[02:08:36.884 --> 02:08:37.966]  You can count on two hands.
[02:08:38.426 --> 02:08:39.848]  How many countries, how many governments.
[02:08:40.489 --> 02:08:47.278]  There are thousands in history of corrupt dictatorships and corrupt king rats and strong men and empires.
[02:08:47.518 --> 02:08:47.959]  Thousands!
[02:08:48.479 --> 02:08:51.203]  Freedom is the rarest jewel
[02:08:52.111 --> 02:08:53.971]  I mean, it's literally the needle in the haystack.
[02:08:54.391 --> 02:09:08.694]  And they've just taught us, oh, no, everything's fine, let us have secret arrest, Jack Bauer's your hero, he tortures children to get the answers, the unjustifies the means, and then the public just fantasizes with that, and, oh, they're keeping me safe from the terror threat.
[02:09:09.754 --> 02:09:13.915]  Which is nothing but a manufactured pretext to bring in high-tech slavery.
[02:09:14.655 --> 02:09:20.736]  And the best way to stay out of their system is to be clean-cut, to be straight,
[02:09:21.664 --> 02:09:24.730]  To not drink, to not use their facilities, to not go to their bars.
[02:09:26.189 --> 02:09:36.574]  And to let them know, I don't go to your restaurants, I don't go downtown anymore because of you, and to go to your city council and speak up about it, and be vocal and say, we see what's going on.
[02:09:36.954 --> 02:09:39.115]  They definitely are trying to acclimate us right now.
[02:09:39.135 --> 02:09:41.376]  This is the domestication process.
[02:09:41.776 --> 02:09:44.237]  And most of the people in the military see what's happening.
[02:09:44.257 --> 02:09:53.321]  In fact, a lot of them, when they call in, they say, you know, nothing ever made sense, but then I saw your films and it was all accurate about what we're doing secretly, but then it never made sense to me before.
[02:09:53.341 --> 02:09:54.242]  Now it all makes sense.
[02:09:55.151 --> 02:09:57.672]  Because you helped me see it from another angle, you see.
[02:09:57.692 --> 02:10:10.739]  I mean, I had so many special forces operators, people who were colonels, generals, black ops commanders, who were so engrossed in it for their whole lives, they're now retired, most of them, that they go, oh, now I can see it all.
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:13.260]  A lot of them do see it, I think.
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:18.783]  It's like they almost feel bad, at least the younger ones, anyways, the ones that you can tell haven't been there too long.
[02:10:19.684 --> 02:10:24.066]  They're almost sympathetic, because I had approached them, and I said, you know, I don't think we really, like,
[02:10:24.636 --> 02:10:27.317]  I appreciate the presence that you've, you know what I mean?
[02:10:27.337 --> 02:10:35.341]  Like we don't appreciate it and they're like, I know, you know, like they do, they feel kind of bad almost, so I'm hoping that they have an understanding of what they're doing.
[02:10:35.381 --> 02:10:48.308]  Oh yeah, I talked to cops in Ottawa, they're covering Milderberg and they were, well they were all nice during the day and then at night they were like freaking out and telling us we couldn't park in designated parking spaces and you know, were trying to harass us and threatening us, so that was sad to see.
[02:10:48.608 --> 02:10:50.809]  Listen, I appreciate you calling in, Jenna, take care.
[02:10:51.414 --> 02:10:51.834]  You too.
[02:10:52.235 --> 02:10:53.796]  James in D.C.
[02:10:53.856 --> 02:10:54.556]  You're on the air.
[02:10:54.656 --> 02:10:55.356]  Go ahead, James.
[02:10:55.737 --> 02:10:56.657]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:10:57.098 --> 02:11:01.180]  I have a couple of comments on amnesty and immigration reform.
[02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:05.202]  I think immigration reform could be solved with simple law enforcement.
[02:11:06.143 --> 02:11:06.923]  Right off the bat.
[02:11:07.224 --> 02:11:08.464]  And I have another comment.
[02:11:09.645 --> 02:11:15.369]  I mean, Bush is like some kind of date rapist with this amnesty thing over and over and over again.
[02:11:15.809 --> 02:11:16.589]  No means no.
[02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:18.971]  The truth is coming out and
[02:11:19.958 --> 02:11:21.119]  9-11 is an inside job.
[02:11:21.159 --> 02:11:21.699]  Have a good day.
[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:22.820]  Thank you.
[02:11:22.860 --> 02:11:26.723]  I appreciate the call, James, in the District of Criminals up there in D.C.
[02:11:28.624 --> 02:11:31.346]  But again, they phrase it as if it's a reform.
[02:11:31.386 --> 02:11:32.646]  That's semantical deception.
[02:11:33.567 --> 02:11:35.788]  People think of reform as automatically being good.
[02:11:36.249 --> 02:11:38.210]  Reform just means to change to form of.
[02:11:39.351 --> 02:11:39.611]  Okay?
[02:11:39.631 --> 02:11:47.596]  If I go out and get hit by a bus and I'm reformed and my head's knocked off my body and my guts are all over the street, I've been reformed.
[02:11:47.756 --> 02:11:48.297]  Is that good?
[02:11:49.409 --> 02:11:53.051]  People a hundred years ago knew semantically that reform just means to change.
[02:11:53.331 --> 02:11:54.892]  They've taught us the word reform means good.
[02:11:54.912 --> 02:11:56.612]  So they say, aren't you for reform?
[02:11:57.193 --> 02:11:58.993]  Don't you want us to fix the problem?
[02:11:59.033 --> 02:12:08.678]  And what it would do was legalize all the illegals and legalize hardcore aggravated felons and give them tax amnesty, something citizens don't get.
[02:12:08.698 --> 02:12:13.540]  So the average bleeding heart, well-meaning liberal goes, of course, let's help these poor people.
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:15.261]  Oh my gosh, let's be reasonable.
[02:12:16.308 --> 02:12:26.332]  What they don't understand is the larger plan to drive down wages, the larger plan to bankrupt the state so the feds can come in because of the welfare, the average illegal gets about triple in services what they actually pay in taxes.
[02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:29.874]  So see, people aren't getting the big picture here.
[02:12:30.394 --> 02:12:33.796]  So you're even coming at it from the angle, sir, of, well, we could fix it with simple law enforcement.
[02:12:33.836 --> 02:12:34.376]  But you could!
[02:12:36.237 --> 02:12:36.637]  You could!
[02:12:36.657 --> 02:12:43.960]  I mean, if you went after employers and did this and deported people who were here illegally, it would be fixed overnight!
[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:45.241]  Literally, in just a few months!
[02:12:47.019 --> 02:12:49.021]  People say the government's dumb, they can't fix it.
[02:12:49.321 --> 02:12:51.123]  They caused the problem, folks!
[02:12:52.805 --> 02:12:57.610]  They can sure run your life and watch everything you do, and believe they can get control of that problem if they wanted to.
[02:12:57.630 --> 02:12:58.711]  So that's another fraud.
[02:12:59.011 --> 02:13:00.993]  George Bush is too dumb to carry out 9-11.
[02:13:03.001 --> 02:13:04.782]  The government's too dumb to carry out 9-11.
[02:13:04.882 --> 02:13:17.726]  Well, let's be clear, I'm not saying George Bush himself orchestrated it, but the military-industrial complex that he fronts for clearly did, and we have evidence up one side and down the other, and it's in my films, Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, and Terror Storm.
[02:13:17.746 --> 02:13:20.887]  And it's in many books and other award-winning films.
[02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:24.288]  Like Loose Change Final Cut coming out soon.
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:29.982]  People say Bush screwed up in Iraq.
[02:13:30.903 --> 02:13:31.944]  The government can't do that.
[02:13:31.984 --> 02:13:32.805]  They can't do anything else.
[02:13:33.065 --> 02:13:34.827]  They can shoot a cruise missile down your chimney.
[02:13:35.387 --> 02:13:36.649]  They can land men on the moon.
[02:13:37.289 --> 02:13:38.831]  They can sure make these computers work.
[02:13:38.851 --> 02:13:40.392]  They can sure mail you a red light ticket.
[02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:47.499]  The bureaucracy tells you nothing can get done, so they just ignore you when you come to them and make you think that's just how it works.
[02:13:48.107 --> 02:13:53.708]  At the top, it's precision run, because they're fighting with each other, they're cutting each other off, they're trying to get in systems.
[02:13:54.709 --> 02:14:01.810]  The big global CEOs, 46 of the biggest economies out of the top 100 aren't countries, they're corporations.
[02:14:02.230 --> 02:14:03.331]  They know what they're doing.
[02:14:04.051 --> 02:14:13.953]  And you see, on the surface you think, well, Iraq's a big failure because Bush said he wanted to democratize it and be out of there in six months, and boy, he screwed up.
[02:14:14.716 --> 02:14:30.901]  But if you read the actual Pentagon plans, Bush has done a precision job of wrecking their economy, taking them from first world to third world, millions of them dead in the 16 years, over 600,000 dead in the last four years of occupation,
[02:14:33.812 --> 02:14:34.973]  The oil's been shut off.
[02:14:35.153 --> 02:14:38.074]  Oil prices are up because of that, because of artificial scarcity.
[02:14:38.374 --> 02:14:42.436]  Hundreds of billions a year in no-bid weapons contracts and other contracts.
[02:14:42.716 --> 02:14:44.396]  Huge mercenary armies formed.
[02:14:44.697 --> 02:14:47.318]  His campaign contributors making billions of dollars.
[02:14:48.558 --> 02:14:50.099]  Permanent bases being built.
[02:14:50.379 --> 02:14:57.582]  And he's on Iran's doorstep, now out of Saudi Arabia with a main base there at the Saddam International Airport.
[02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:04.552]  The real goal, according to PNAC and the Pentagon documents, was to go into Iraq.
[02:15:05.492 --> 02:15:18.417]  Dick Cheney wrote in September of 2000, before he was even Vice President, in the PNAC documents, which they published, they don't hide this, he said, Saddam is not a threat militarily, but it's a convenient pretext to say he is with WMDs.
[02:15:18.917 --> 02:15:21.518]  Because he knows the media they own isn't going to point that out.
[02:15:23.709 --> 02:15:41.733]  He says, we're going to go into Iraq, we're going to break it up in three parts, and we're going to use Iraq as a projection point for a control matrix to invade Iran or Syria both, and then link up Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, right to China's doorstep.
[02:15:41.973 --> 02:15:47.914]  And then you have Russia ringed by Western Europe, into the Middle East, into Central Asia,
[02:15:49.605 --> 02:15:50.926]  Japan is a military base.
[02:15:50.966 --> 02:15:52.187]  The Philippines is a military base.
[02:15:52.447 --> 02:15:56.430]  They're encircling Russia and China.
[02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:58.852]  And, by the way, I didn't just figure that out.
[02:15:58.892 --> 02:15:59.732]  Ooh, I'm so smart!
[02:16:00.413 --> 02:16:02.074]  The Pentagon says this!
[02:16:03.755 --> 02:16:04.075]  Okay?
[02:16:04.436 --> 02:16:05.897]  They say that's what they're doing.
[02:16:07.237 --> 02:16:12.201]  The Arabs aren't a threat, ladies and gentlemen, to our military or our government.
[02:16:13.167 --> 02:16:18.772]  But the military, the military missile complex had to stage those 9-11 attacks so you would feel like it was a threat.
[02:16:19.233 --> 02:16:21.595]  What does the Big New Brzezinski say in his book, The Grand Chessboard?
[02:16:21.855 --> 02:16:26.719]  Without a catastrophic Pearl Harbor event, we're not going to be able to have imperial mobilization.
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:37.489]  To mobilize our slaves, that's what we are to them, to fight the barbarians in Russia and China and in the Middle East and Central Asia.
[02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:39.050]  That's his word for them, the barbarians.
[02:16:39.631 --> 02:16:41.271]  We've got to have a terror attack to do that.
[02:16:41.491 --> 02:16:46.553]  What did the PNAC document, same document written by Dick Cheney, Rebuilding America's Defenses, what did it say?
[02:16:47.453 --> 02:17:03.517]  Dick Cheney says, we're going to move into Iraq, we're going to stay there forever, we're going to build permanent bases, we're going to project power to overthrow the governments or invade or just bomb, any of those options, into the West, into Syria, into the East, into Iran, to link up and do that.
[02:17:04.238 --> 02:17:11.643]  And they say it's for a one world government, a new world order, with the engine of it being the United States as the Pax Americana linked up with the EU.
[02:17:13.624 --> 02:17:22.029]  And then Europe, which really owns this country predominantly, uses us as their pit bull to go out and do the dirty work.
[02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:24.871]  Alright, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:17:25.882 --> 02:17:26.643]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:26.663 --> 02:17:28.025]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:28.526 --> 02:17:37.698]  The news websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and JonesReport.com, as well as Infowars.net.
[02:17:37.738 --> 02:17:38.779]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:38.799 --> 02:17:39.200]  Stay with us.
[02:17:47.836 --> 02:17:51.977]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:17:52.197 --> 02:17:53.958]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:17:54.218 --> 02:18:00.520]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:06.921]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:18:07.161 --> 02:18:09.002]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:18:09.082 --> 02:18:09.462]  We're good.
[02:18:32.979 --> 02:18:36.300]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625 That's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[02:18:45.809 --> 02:18:46.810]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[02:18:46.850 --> 02:18:47.050]  June 20, 2007.
[02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.431]  Golds at $660.40.
[02:18:47.551 --> 02:18:49.492]  Old school coins can be purchased for $681.77, $336.40 for half, $168.20 per quarter.
[02:18:49.532 --> 02:18:49.993]  That's $681.77, $336.40, and $168.20.
[02:18:50.033 --> 02:18:51.154]  70% of China's $1 trillion reserves are in dollar.
[02:18:51.174 --> 02:18:53.035]  Now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[02:18:53.095 --> 02:18:55.037]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[02:18:55.057 --> 02:18:55.577]  Bad news for U.S.

[02:21:38.732 --> 02:21:40.892]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride.
[02:21:57.876 --> 02:22:18.322]  With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The masters hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[02:22:20.086 --> 02:22:23.748]  But I am still alive.
[02:22:26.409 --> 02:22:27.870]  I was a sailor.
[02:22:28.730 --> 02:22:31.452]  I was born upon the tide.
[02:22:31.472 --> 02:22:36.614]  With the sea I did abide.
[02:22:38.335 --> 02:22:42.857]  I sailed a schooner around the whole of New Mexico.
[02:22:44.398 --> 02:22:47.680]  I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a float.
[02:22:52.065 --> 02:22:53.046]  Welcome back!
[02:22:53.086 --> 02:22:59.329]  We're going to have Jason Bermasalis in the next segment.
[02:22:59.409 --> 02:23:02.271]  He's decided to play even more of the interview.
[02:23:13.104 --> 02:23:22.852]  Frankly, people put two and two together and have already figured out who this government official, who this security individual was inside the Office of Emergency Management when he went over there.
[02:23:24.093 --> 02:23:30.337]  And it's already out there, people surmising, but they promised not to say the name themselves until loose change final cut came out.
[02:23:30.377 --> 02:23:37.543]  The fella knew it probably would leak out anyways, but we're keeping our word on this until it breaks somewhere else and then we will do a big write-up on it.
[02:23:37.583 --> 02:23:40.785]  But he is going to give you a little bit more information coming up in the next segment.
[02:23:40.805 --> 02:23:42.607]  For those that just joined us, what are we talking about?
[02:23:42.987 --> 02:23:48.411]  Not only Michael Moore starting to say 9-11 could be an inside job and really joining 9-11 Truth yesterday.
[02:23:48.791 --> 02:23:57.058]  The neocons are now savaging him and myself at the same time as Hot Air and Michelle Malkin who writes books about putting everybody in concentration camps right now.
[02:23:57.878 --> 02:23:58.759]  But what are we discussing?
[02:23:58.779 --> 02:24:09.587]  9-11 bombshell, WTC security officials, details explosions inside building, says bombs were going off in 7 before either tower collapsed.
[02:24:10.732 --> 02:24:27.928]  And we did welcome the Loose Change creators Dylan Avery and Jason Berman to discuss an exclusive interview they had conducted last week with an individual in high-level security clearances who was inside the Office of Emergency Management in World Trade Center 7 and has described the detailed explosions inside the building prior to the collapse.
[02:24:28.866 --> 02:24:31.387]  ...of any of the buildings at Ground Zero on 9-11.
[02:24:31.867 --> 02:24:43.452]  The interview to be featured in the forthcoming final cut of Loose Change is currently under wraps, but the creators have allowed some details to leak purely to protect themselves and the individuals involved who have asked to remain anonymous until the film is released.
[02:24:43.492 --> 02:24:57.417]  But, again, people... because we made the point, hey, this guy's real, he's been on national TV, interviewed, they edited up what he had to say, and he talked about, yeah, I was going down the stairwell and heard the explosions and the bombs go off.
[02:24:58.044 --> 02:25:04.966]  What they cut, though, just like what William Rodriguez, who was in one of the towers, said, that the bombs were going off in seven.
[02:25:05.266 --> 02:25:06.987]  They acted like he was in tower one or two.
[02:25:07.707 --> 02:25:10.368]  They acted like Rodriguez was talking about bombs going off.
[02:25:11.148 --> 02:25:16.930]  William Rodriguez, the janitor who saved a bunch of people, one of the last to get out alive, collapsed on him.
[02:25:17.671 --> 02:25:21.732]  He was talking about bombs exploding before the building, long before it collapsed.
[02:25:22.863 --> 02:25:27.387]  I mean, in the basement, explosions and people having their skin blown off, you name it.
[02:25:27.707 --> 02:25:29.168]  Those explosives inside the buildings.
[02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:32.210]  So, this is huge.
[02:25:32.470 --> 02:25:39.195]  And, of course, they got challenged last night on air about all this, and basically, colleagues were calling in who had already basically figured out who it is.
[02:25:40.176 --> 02:25:43.699]  This is not long until everybody knows, but we're going to still keep our mouths shut.
[02:25:44.292 --> 02:25:44.953]  We're good to go.
[02:26:01.787 --> 02:26:02.448]  I don't know.
[02:26:22.327 --> 02:26:24.608]  Well, this is just absolutely amazing development.
[02:26:24.628 --> 02:26:29.809]  When we get back, I'm going to play the clips you heard yesterday, and then you're going to hear a new clip.
[02:26:29.849 --> 02:26:31.350]  He's sending it up to the network right now.
[02:26:31.370 --> 02:26:33.550]  We just decided to do this a few minutes ago.
[02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:38.391]  And then Jason Burmiss will fill you in on all of this.
[02:26:39.012 --> 02:26:40.732]  So this is breaking news.
[02:26:41.192 --> 02:26:43.993]  You see, they wanted to keep it anonymity, but then people challenged the story.
[02:26:44.553 --> 02:26:49.114]  So maybe it's a good thing that it's now starting to come out.
[02:26:49.154 --> 02:26:50.735]  But we are not going to be the ones to tell.
[02:26:51.474 --> 02:26:53.015]  That is certainly the case.
[02:26:53.055 --> 02:27:00.441]  But if people can figure this out, like Sherlock Holmes, then it's elementary, my dear Watson, as they say.
[02:27:00.522 --> 02:27:02.123]  So that is coming up.
[02:27:02.803 --> 02:27:12.932]  Before I end this segment, I do want to encourage everyone to join me tonight from 7 to 9 o'clock at Brave New Books at the end of The Drag, or the start of The Drag, depending on which direction you're coming from.
[02:27:13.232 --> 02:27:14.393]  They're on the south end.
[02:27:17.953 --> 02:27:20.195]  I guess you would call it, yes, the south end of the drag.
[02:27:20.615 --> 02:27:21.796]  The southwest end of the drag.
[02:27:22.156 --> 02:27:26.659]  And Brave New Books for a book signing, video signing, and to show a sneak peek of my new film, Endgame.
[02:27:26.879 --> 02:27:32.664]  And then tomorrow night, I'm gonna show about half of it at the Alamo Drafts House, as well as some sneak peeks of Terror Storm.
[02:27:36.346 --> 02:27:37.267]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.747 --> 02:27:39.348]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.269 --> 02:27:42.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.741 --> 02:27:47.902]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:27:48.022 --> 02:27:50.144]  of the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:27:50.424 --> 02:27:53.427]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:27:53.487 --> 02:27:54.167]  is a real thing.
[02:27:54.227 --> 02:28:01.113]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:28:01.233 --> 02:28:12.122]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[02:28:12.262 --> 02:28:20.970]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of disease activators that cause chronic health issues and means a much higher level of wellness for you and your family.

[02:28:38.484 --> 02:28:40.825]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:28:46.932 --> 02:28:53.716]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:28:54.076 --> 02:29:00.480]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:29:00.961 --> 02:29:10.867]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:29:11.347 --> 02:29:14.809]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:29:15.109 --> 02:29:17.790]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:29:18.430 --> 02:29:21.111]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[02:29:21.672 --> 02:29:25.793]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[02:29:25.833 --> 02:29:27.174]  Box 969 Soquel, S-O-Q-U-E-L, California 95073.

[02:29:45.856 --> 02:29:49.898]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:50.118 --> 02:29:53.520]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:57.182]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:57.442 --> 02:30:00.703]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:00.723 --> 02:30:06.186]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:30:06.206 --> 02:30:11.369]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill,
[02:30:11.749 --> 02:30:15.814]  Well, going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:15.954 --> 02:30:17.255]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:30:17.275 --> 02:30:22.802]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:23.242 --> 02:30:27.707]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:27.767 --> 02:30:29.069]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:29.289 --> 02:30:35.330]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 Or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll free number again?
[02:30:35.350 --> 02:30:40.191]  1-877-928-8822 While you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[02:31:03.009 --> 02:31:07.470]  The place is where you used to play.
[02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:16.311]  It was an inside joke, that it well connected.
[02:31:16.411 --> 02:31:21.552]  You're an inner protest, so merrily rejected.
[02:31:21.672 --> 02:31:28.074]  It was an inside joke, like it always is.
[02:31:28.174 --> 02:31:30.434]  Chalk it, to sin.
[02:31:32.419 --> 02:31:34.360]  Chalk it up to business as usual.
[02:31:35.180 --> 02:31:40.102]  Governments have always been run by tyrannical, out-of-control individuals.
[02:31:40.142 --> 02:31:41.603]  And sometimes they're worse than others.
[02:31:41.623 --> 02:31:43.023]  You get a Stalin.
[02:31:43.043 --> 02:31:43.664]  You get a Hitler.
[02:31:44.044 --> 02:31:46.145]  You might... you get a Mao Zedong.
[02:31:48.546 --> 02:31:49.706]  A Pol Pot.
[02:31:51.907 --> 02:31:52.767]  All right.
[02:31:54.088 --> 02:31:57.169]  We've got Jason Burmess waiting in the wings of loose change.
[02:31:59.610 --> 02:31:59.990]  911.com.
[02:32:00.030 --> 02:32:00.991]  We've got links up on
[02:32:01.747 --> 02:32:03.669]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:32:03.689 --> 02:32:06.731]  The big story we broke yesterday thanks to their help.
[02:32:07.252 --> 02:32:08.373]  Thanks to them bringing it here.
[02:32:08.393 --> 02:32:15.659]  9-1-1 Bombshell WTC7 security official details explosions inside building.
[02:32:15.979 --> 02:32:20.082]  Says bombs were going off in WTC7 before either tower collapsed.
[02:32:20.102 --> 02:32:21.123]  Now I know his name.
[02:32:21.624 --> 02:32:24.546]  He's a prominent individual associated with New York security.
[02:32:25.206 --> 02:32:30.571]  There have been videos of him on the news saying this on the day, but they cut it up to edit it
[02:32:31.198 --> 02:32:35.702]  Where it was just him talking about explosions and they made you think that was when the tower started falling.
[02:32:35.782 --> 02:32:36.182]  No, no, no.
[02:32:36.523 --> 02:32:40.026]  This is Building 7 when the second tower hadn't even been hit yet.
[02:32:42.368 --> 02:32:47.192]  He also saw dead bodies all over the place and was told not to look at them by the firemen and police.
[02:32:49.674 --> 02:32:53.618]  And he's been interviewed for the final cut of loose change coming out in the next few months.
[02:32:54.679 --> 02:32:58.102]  We didn't want him to get hit by two waves of phone calls and threats.
[02:32:58.789 --> 02:33:04.834]  Better for him to just deal with it when the film came out, but people are good detectives and basically folks have been figuring out who it is.
[02:33:06.896 --> 02:33:16.144]  So, there's a few names getting batted around and people have certainly hit bullseye, but I'm not going to tell them which name is it, because we're not going to be the ones to break this.
[02:33:17.165 --> 02:33:22.310]  As soon as people do figure it out, though, we'll get a big article up on PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:33:23.351 --> 02:33:33.576]  Before we go to these clips and then back to Jason Bermas to set up the next clip for you, why would criminal elements of the government carry out 9-11?
[02:33:33.836 --> 02:33:37.958]  Why would Hitler burn his own Reichstag to declare martial law to get a police state going?
[02:33:38.438 --> 02:33:41.540]  The government's own documents, Operation Northwood, U.S.
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:52.485]  government plan, back in the 60s said, we'll bomb D.C., we'll commit sniper attacks, we'll attack the Marine Corps base at Guantanamo Bay and blame it on the Cubans to start World War III with the Russians.
[02:33:53.503 --> 02:34:07.390]  We'll commit sniper attacks, how to frame Patsy's, we'll bomb the Capitol, we'll bomb Miami, we'll shoot down planes, claim a bunch of college students got killed because young people really makes the public mad, cause a hopeful wave of national indignation.
[02:34:07.410 --> 02:34:14.214]  If anybody asks me why elements, small elements, but the powerful, in positions of power elements, why they would be involved in attacks,
[02:34:14.893 --> 02:34:21.137]  It's to get the beehive of America all stirred up to go steal the oil and have the weapon systems and take over the Middle East.
[02:34:21.817 --> 02:34:27.300]  And, more importantly, set up a domestic police state here in the United States.
[02:34:28.601 --> 02:34:31.442]  And there's so many pieces of evidence to 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:34:31.462 --> 02:34:43.649]  We just challenge people to go to Google Video, watch Terror Storm for free, watch Loose Change 2nd Edition for free, see Road to Tyranny for free, the films I've made and the films that others have made, and go check out the evidence and facts we bring forward.
[02:34:44.599 --> 02:34:51.323]  You know, there have been a few, quote, debunking things written, and you actually, now books have been written debunking the debunking, because it's all frauds.
[02:34:51.343 --> 02:34:52.423]  What they're saying is lies.
[02:34:52.443 --> 02:34:55.185]  They're counting on you not checking out what we're saying.
[02:34:55.485 --> 02:34:56.906]  There were bombs in all the buildings.
[02:34:57.266 --> 02:35:01.749]  We have hundreds of police, firemen, and others on record saying, I was in there and bombs were going off.
[02:35:01.989 --> 02:35:03.870]  Boom, boom, boom was as if there were detonators.
[02:35:04.528 --> 02:35:12.595]  Building 7 was down the street, not hit by a plane, small fires at the CIA, the FBI, the Office of Emergency Management, all based in it, and imploded.
[02:35:13.475 --> 02:35:27.847]  We've got international media here with us today, I'm not going to get into who or why, but I wanted you to just comment, Jason Burmish, I mean, sum it up in two minutes before we get into these clips, why this is important, and how it's just one more smoking gun for the mountain of smoking guns.
[02:35:28.027 --> 02:35:32.451]  I mean, you sum it up, why 9-11 is an inside job, Jason Burmish.
[02:35:33.456 --> 02:35:45.444]  Well, when you look at the official story behind Building 7, it's that when the North and South Tower collapsed, collapses happened, the damage to the building was so great that at 520 it simply imploded in on itself.
[02:35:45.984 --> 02:35:49.667]  Makes no mention of any loss of life in that building and no explosions in it.
[02:35:50.187 --> 02:35:59.213]  And now we have this official coming forward saying he was called up on the phone after the first plane had hit, he was in the building before the second plane had hit, he went up to the
[02:36:00.029 --> 02:36:10.276]  OEM, which was where he was supposed to go, that's where local government and, uh, you know, federal agencies were coordinated because, you know, again, the CIA, the IRS, the DOD, the Secret Service were all there.
[02:36:11.316 --> 02:36:12.877]  And he gets up there and he's locked out.
[02:36:13.798 --> 02:36:15.319]  This guy's not supposed to be locked out.
[02:36:16.019 --> 02:36:22.744]  Then, all of a sudden, he goes all the way down, escorts him up through the freight elevator with another individual.
[02:36:23.324 --> 02:36:26.086]  They get into the Office of Emergency Management and it's a ghost town.
[02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:33.034]  Um, now we know it was manned just prior to him getting in there because we have cups of coffee with steam coming off them, half-eaten sandwiches.
[02:36:33.434 --> 02:36:36.276]  He then gets a call from his supervisor who asks him where he is.
[02:36:36.917 --> 02:36:40.679]  When he tells him he's in Building 7, there's worry in his voice, there's a long pause.
[02:36:41.059 --> 02:36:44.061]  He says, get out of that building, call me when he's there.
[02:36:44.081 --> 02:36:49.745]  The individual he was actually with at the time... Listen, somebody pick the phone up, and I heard him talk earlier.
[02:36:49.765 --> 02:36:51.486]  If they can get off the line, that'd be nice.
[02:36:51.826 --> 02:36:54.228]  Can you go back about a minute and start over, Jason?
[02:36:54.875 --> 02:36:55.055]  Sure.
[02:36:56.317 --> 02:37:00.521]  Basically, again, this guy gets called up after the first plane has hit the World Trade Center.
[02:37:00.741 --> 02:37:03.283]  He goes to where he's supposed to go, which is the 23rd floor of Building 7.
[02:37:03.584 --> 02:37:05.306]  That's where the Office of Emergency Management is.
[02:37:05.746 --> 02:37:06.226]  He gets there.
[02:37:06.266 --> 02:37:07.307]  Police are all in the lobby.
[02:37:07.828 --> 02:37:11.131]  He can't get through the regular destination with another individual.
[02:37:12.773 --> 02:37:14.735]  They get escorted through a freight elevator.
[02:37:15.709 --> 02:37:19.792]  As they get escorted through a freight elevator, they get into the Office of Emergency Management.
[02:37:20.112 --> 02:37:22.234]  It's literally deserted and just deserted.
[02:37:22.554 --> 02:37:25.336]  Again, coffee, still hot, half-eaten sandwiches.
[02:37:25.697 --> 02:37:29.760]  He gets a call from his supervisor, tells him he's in Building 7, there's worry in his voice.
[02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:31.961]  Long pause, tells him to get out of there immediately.
[02:37:32.502 --> 02:37:35.344]  The other individual he was with was slow and they had to take the staircase.
[02:37:35.844 --> 02:37:37.606]  And he told me that's what saved his life.
[02:37:38.266 --> 02:37:44.451]  Because when they got down to the 8th floor, down to the 7th, almost to the 6th, huge explosion from underneath them.
[02:37:45.197 --> 02:37:46.278]  Uh, he was trapped on the side.
[02:37:46.298 --> 02:37:48.059]  He climbed back up into the 8th floor.
[02:37:48.079 --> 02:37:54.243]  Uh, clearly, both towers were still standing when this happened because he was communicating with firemen outside.
[02:37:54.263 --> 02:37:57.405]  Uh, he had actually knocked out a window with a fire hydrant.
[02:37:57.765 --> 02:38:03.809]  And this just proves that there were explosives detonated in Building 7 prior to either collapse of Building 1 and 2.
[02:38:06.025 --> 02:38:14.850]  And he also sees all these dead bodies and is told he didn't see it, which at first they claimed no one ever died, then they had to admit that people did die in there, but again, he's confirming all that.
[02:38:15.390 --> 02:38:25.455]  And for those that don't know, the head of FEMA, local FEMA, the Kenny, and they changed the name to Kennedy, was on ABC News that night of 9-11.
[02:38:25.755 --> 02:38:30.938]  He said, yeah, we got here last night, and we deployed this morning for the attacks in Tripod 2.
[02:38:31.278 --> 02:38:34.240]  Then we found out Tripod 2 was real, they first tried to deny it,
[02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:43.633]  They had moved everybody out already that morning to the end of the pier for a drill set up months before of terrorists attacking the entire World Trade Center complex.
[02:38:44.033 --> 02:38:51.504]  So the CIA, the FBI, the Office of Emergency Management, FEMA, the county, the city, they're already down on the pier for Mobile Command Centers.
[02:38:51.784 --> 02:38:54.326]  Running a drill of terrorist attacking conveniently.
[02:38:54.547 --> 02:38:56.308]  Well, this emergency manager wasn't in the loop.
[02:38:56.388 --> 02:39:02.254]  He showed up to be there at his office and, you know, to go find the mayor.
[02:39:02.514 --> 02:39:08.179]  He's there with another city official, very high level, and shows up, and boom, there it is!
[02:39:08.599 --> 02:39:13.324]  And they're going to have a lot of trouble spinning this when his name and the information comes out, Jason Burmess.
[02:39:13.784 --> 02:39:19.090]  Well, I think so too, especially because their claim is, well, that explosion he felt was the first tower collapsing.
[02:39:19.270 --> 02:39:19.951]  No, not true.
[02:39:20.171 --> 02:39:24.215]  When he was communicating with the firefighters, he could see both buildings, okay?
[02:39:24.435 --> 02:39:30.161]  He witnessed both buildings collapsing because he was communicating with the firefighters as it happened and they ran away.
[02:39:30.442 --> 02:39:31.943]  He didn't get out of that building until about 1-1-30.
[02:39:33.058 --> 02:39:36.120]  And they actually had to make a makeshift hole down in the lobby.
[02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:36.960]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:42.563]  Both the towers falling only knocked out a few windows and banged into the edge.
[02:39:43.044 --> 02:39:46.145]  They keep showing other buildings and saying that's the damage.
[02:39:46.205 --> 02:39:46.746]  It's a fraud.
[02:39:46.786 --> 02:39:48.287]  The fires didn't start until later.
[02:39:48.527 --> 02:39:53.309]  We have all these firefighter photos up close of 5 and 6 and others burning.
[02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:55.491]  And you see 7 right there, clear as day.
[02:39:55.511 --> 02:39:57.652]  They like to aim from the north side.
[02:39:58.442 --> 02:40:05.827]  Absolutely, and that's just another piece of the puzzle, and now we have a corroborating witness saying there were explosives in Building 7 prior to the collapse of the building, which is
[02:40:22.142 --> 02:40:25.945]  A huge blow to the official version because, again, there was no loss of life.
[02:40:26.005 --> 02:40:29.047]  And plus, we know this guy testified before the 9-11 Commission.
[02:40:29.347 --> 02:40:33.409]  I mean, he told us, and he was like, you know, I thought they were just conducting a real investigation.
[02:40:33.790 --> 02:40:36.652]  He's like, I don't know if they like the answers I gave, but I told the truth.
[02:40:37.032 --> 02:40:38.593]  And he never heard anything back from them.
[02:40:39.013 --> 02:40:40.114]  And he's got his questions.
[02:40:40.554 --> 02:40:40.794]  Sure.
[02:40:41.034 --> 02:40:46.398]  Now, we're going to play a clip you haven't played yet, but I want to play the two clips from yesterday to introduce this.
[02:40:46.438 --> 02:40:49.320]  The first two clips we played yesterday, what if we described those, Jason?
[02:40:50.384 --> 02:40:52.405]  Yeah, they basically just tell what I just told.
[02:40:52.445 --> 02:40:55.147]  He gets into the building after the first plane is hit.
[02:40:55.507 --> 02:40:56.247]  It's a ghost town.
[02:40:56.287 --> 02:40:58.268]  He gets down to around the 6th floor.
[02:40:58.288 --> 02:41:00.789]  Huge explosion from under them and he gets trapped into the building.
[02:41:01.289 --> 02:41:02.470]  And that's about it.
[02:41:03.390 --> 02:41:04.851]  Let's go ahead and play those clips first.
[02:41:04.891 --> 02:41:05.411]  Here it is.
[02:41:07.112 --> 02:41:15.136]  I was asked to go and man the Office of Emergency Management at the World Trade Center 7th on the 23rd floor.
[02:41:16.531 --> 02:41:19.832]  As I arrived there, there were police all in the lobby.
[02:41:23.152 --> 02:41:24.613]  They showed me the way to the elevator.
[02:41:24.653 --> 02:41:26.653]  We got up to the 23rd floor.
[02:41:27.073 --> 02:41:27.713]  We couldn't get in.
[02:41:28.393 --> 02:41:29.274]  We had to go back down.
[02:41:30.054 --> 02:41:34.635]  Then security and police took us to the freight elevators where they took us back up and we did get in.
[02:41:35.335 --> 02:41:43.236]  Upon arriving into the OEM EOC, we noticed that everybody was gone.
[02:41:44.357 --> 02:41:45.997]  I saw coffee that was on the desk.
[02:41:46.858 --> 02:41:49.039]  Still, the smoke was still coming off the coffee.
[02:41:49.219 --> 02:41:51.300]  I saw half-eaten sandwiches.
[02:41:53.001 --> 02:42:00.825]  And after I called several individuals, one individual told me to leave and leave right away.
[02:42:02.666 --> 02:42:03.827]  So I came running back in.
[02:42:03.847 --> 02:42:05.528]  He said, we're the only ones up here.
[02:42:05.548 --> 02:42:06.188]  We got to get out of here.
[02:42:06.228 --> 02:42:07.109]  He found the stairwell.
[02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:12.051]  So we subsequently went to the stairwell, and we're going down the stairs.
[02:42:12.932 --> 02:42:14.593]  When we reached the sixth floor,
[02:42:17.102 --> 02:42:18.783]  The landing that we were standing on gave way.
[02:42:19.483 --> 02:42:22.064]  There was an explosion and the landing gave way.
[02:42:23.404 --> 02:42:24.205]  I was left there hanging.
[02:42:24.425 --> 02:42:27.606]  I had to climb back up and now I had to walk back up to the 8th floor.
[02:42:29.366 --> 02:42:30.907]  After getting to the 8th floor, everything was dark.
[02:42:33.015 --> 02:42:34.196]  Alright, that's the first clip.
[02:42:34.516 --> 02:42:36.057]  We're going to put a second and then a third.
[02:42:36.097 --> 02:42:37.198]  The new clip, no one's heard yet.
[02:42:37.278 --> 02:42:41.561]  Now, to be clear, it's also big news there that he's confirming what Giuliani said.
[02:42:41.581 --> 02:42:48.065]  Giuliani slipped up to Peter Jennings and said, yeah, I was told to get out of Building 7 because the other towers were going to collapse.
[02:42:48.906 --> 02:42:50.547]  Now, this is what he's saying.
[02:42:50.567 --> 02:43:00.133]  Now, Giuliani confirmed this, then the media tried to spin it and deny it, and our reporters, we are Change.org and InfoWars.com reporters, just a few weeks ago talked to Giuliani three times.
[02:43:00.891 --> 02:43:08.095]  And he said, I never said I was told Tower 1 and 2 were going to collapse, though he told Peter Jennings, and then he told the 9-11 Commission the same thing.
[02:43:08.356 --> 02:43:09.556]  So now he's been caught in a lie.
[02:43:10.297 --> 02:43:15.240]  New York NBC did confirm he's lying, did post his quotes from the 9-11 Commission.
[02:43:15.780 --> 02:43:16.520]  Caught in a lie.
[02:43:17.321 --> 02:43:22.804]  But here is another emergency manager, high-level, and saying that he was told, get out of there.
[02:43:23.224 --> 02:43:24.585]  Okay, he's told, get out of the building.
[02:43:24.825 --> 02:43:26.026]  That's important, isn't it, Jason?
[02:43:26.486 --> 02:43:29.428]  It is important, and actually Giuliani was on Barkley Street
[02:43:29.921 --> 02:43:33.263]  When he had been told that the first tower was going to collapse.
[02:43:33.563 --> 02:43:43.407]  However, discussing with this individual, he told me that Giuliani was in 7 earlier in the day.
[02:43:43.528 --> 02:43:45.528]  And that's why the other individual was with him.
[02:43:45.849 --> 02:43:46.969]  He was told to meet him there.
[02:43:47.509 --> 02:43:52.772]  And in the hurry that a lot of these people left, I would only assume that they were setting up tripod.
[02:43:53.366 --> 02:44:06.954]  As, uh, you know, this guy also confirmed to me, and that they had it somewhat manned, but when this, when this thing went down, they probably called up the office and said, you know, get out of there right away, come down... Well, they always use, I mean, for those that don't know, they always use a drill as a cover.
[02:44:06.994 --> 02:44:12.157]  That way, if your operatives get caught in the government planting bombs, to be blamed on somebody, you can say you're part of the drill.
[02:44:12.477 --> 02:44:17.880]  Take during the G8 a few weeks ago, they caught American agents, major German newspapers, with plastic explosive bombs.
[02:44:18.341 --> 02:44:20.602]  Notice that was the time we did confirm Bush was sick.
[02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:22.260]  Bush wasn't going to be there.
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:22.861]  He was sick.
[02:44:22.921 --> 02:44:24.582]  And then they catch U.S.
[02:44:24.642 --> 02:44:25.462]  agents with bombs.
[02:44:25.842 --> 02:44:27.303]  And they said, oh, it's just a drill!
[02:44:27.903 --> 02:44:32.205]  And on 7-7 in London, drills of the exact same trains, exact same time, being bombed.
[02:44:33.065 --> 02:44:33.906]  Yeah, by Pfizer consultants.
[02:44:33.986 --> 02:44:34.826]  It's unbelievable.
[02:44:34.986 --> 02:44:43.490]  And on 9-11, they had drills that the Pentagon was running of hijacked jets being flown to the World Trade Center's Pentagon and Capitol traveling and building in San Francisco.
[02:44:43.510 --> 02:44:44.111]  I mean, we've got them.
[02:44:44.131 --> 02:44:44.951]  Here's the second clip.
[02:44:45.091 --> 02:44:46.191]  Then we'll play the new clip in a moment.
[02:44:46.492 --> 02:44:47.212]  Here's the second clip.
[02:44:48.385 --> 02:44:51.866]  Well, I'm just confused about one thing and one thing only.
[02:44:52.727 --> 02:44:54.907]  Why World Trade Center 7 went down in the first place?
[02:44:55.367 --> 02:44:56.428]  I'm very confused about that.
[02:44:56.848 --> 02:44:57.568]  I know what I heard.
[02:44:59.129 --> 02:44:59.909]  I heard explosions.
[02:45:01.189 --> 02:45:06.691]  The explanation I got was it was the fuel oil tank.
[02:45:08.732 --> 02:45:09.572]  I'm an old boiler guy.
[02:45:11.032 --> 02:45:14.153]  If it was a fuel oil tank, it would have been one side of the building.
[02:45:15.294 --> 02:45:16.294]  When I got to that lobby,
[02:45:17.549 --> 02:45:20.492]  The lobby was totally destroyed.
[02:45:21.353 --> 02:45:23.895]  It looked like King Kong had came through it and stepped on it.
[02:45:24.916 --> 02:45:27.238]  And it was so destroyed, I didn't know where I was.
[02:45:28.479 --> 02:45:31.202]  And it was so destroyed, they had to take me out through a hole in the wall.
[02:45:31.982 --> 02:45:35.185]  A makeshift hole that I believe the fire department made to get me out.
[02:45:36.166 --> 02:45:36.867]  Me and Mr. Hess out.
[02:45:37.828 --> 02:45:43.113]  Alright, now... This next clip, shut it up for us.
[02:45:43.935 --> 02:45:50.420]  Basically it's just a short clip confirming that that explosion that took place on the sixth floor was prior to both towers collapsing.
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:54.543]  He just confirmed it because we wanted to make sure and clear because we knew what the debunkers were going to say.
[02:45:54.563 --> 02:45:58.246]  We're going to say, oh, well that explosion was just the first tower collapsing.
[02:45:58.446 --> 02:45:59.267]  Absolutely not.
[02:45:59.567 --> 02:46:01.448]  He confirms right here it was prior to both.
[02:46:01.908 --> 02:46:02.309]  Here we go.
[02:46:03.249 --> 02:46:10.815]  As I told you earlier, both buildings were still standing because I looked to, I looked one way, looked the other way.
[02:46:10.935 --> 02:46:11.916]  Now there's nothing there.
[02:46:13.263 --> 02:46:17.073]  When I got to the 6th floor before all this time, when I got to the 6th floor, there was an explosion.
[02:46:17.313 --> 02:46:19.459]  That's what forced us back to the 8th floor.
[02:46:20.301 --> 02:46:21.424]  Both buildings were still standing.
[02:46:23.624 --> 02:46:24.525]  This is massive.
[02:46:24.925 --> 02:46:28.407]  Jason, you guys better put your heads together up there, because you're smart guys.
[02:46:28.427 --> 02:46:29.408]  You can come up with the answer.
[02:46:29.488 --> 02:46:31.189]  I promised not to break who this is.
[02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:34.131]  You've got my word on that, but I brought it up to you this morning.
[02:46:34.171 --> 02:46:35.853]  I said, I'm already getting emails.
[02:46:35.913 --> 02:46:36.913]  People basically know.
[02:46:36.933 --> 02:46:40.276]  It's in between two or three people, and it looks like they figured it out.
[02:46:40.696 --> 02:46:45.840]  Now, it's our job not to break the confidence, but we also knew it would probably get out.
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:46.600]  He knows that.
[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:48.621]  When do we decide it's now broken?
[02:46:52.584 --> 02:46:53.945]  I mean, are you guys going to do that tonight?
[02:46:53.965 --> 02:46:55.545]  Because it's now out there.
[02:46:56.066 --> 02:47:01.748]  Well, I'm not going to be able to confirm or deny any names until the movie actually comes out, just because of this guy's job.
[02:47:01.788 --> 02:47:04.809]  And I promised him that we weren't going to bring his job into it.
[02:47:04.829 --> 02:47:12.352]  Unfortunately, the information that does connect him to September 11th, that's out there, that's public knowledge, does say where he works.
[02:47:12.432 --> 02:47:19.755]  And one of the big things in my mind is I've seen other people come forward with this kind of stuff, like Kevin Ryan and Stephen Jones, and they lost their jobs.
[02:47:20.285 --> 02:47:25.427]  And this guy is literally three years away from his pension, and I just, I couldn't do that to this man.
[02:47:25.487 --> 02:47:27.887]  Well, I agree, and I mean, let's talk about that.
[02:47:29.088 --> 02:47:36.890]  Stephen Jones, top-level physicist, award-winning, I mean, he's in the very A-plus top tier, creme de la creme, and he lost his job.
[02:47:37.390 --> 02:47:38.451]  We're going public on 9-11.
[02:47:38.471 --> 02:47:40.771]  They didn't say his data was wrong, they just said, we want you to go.
[02:47:41.591 --> 02:47:49.854]  Kevin Ryan, Underwriting Laboratories, the head of a whole division, he saw their internal report that fire wouldn't melt the steel, and that Underwriting Laboratories believed there was a cover-up.
[02:47:50.672 --> 02:47:53.994]  No, I haven't seen it yet Alex, but I'm sure I'm going to get emails about it shortly.
[02:48:21.042 --> 02:48:22.804]  All right, well, we're going to do a final segment.
[02:48:22.824 --> 02:48:23.705]  Let me talk to you during the break.
[02:48:23.745 --> 02:48:24.505]  Come back for one minute.
[02:48:24.826 --> 02:48:31.872]  On the other side is Jason Burmiss, one of the hardest working guys out there in the fight against the New World Order with the Loose Change crew.
[02:48:32.212 --> 02:48:36.936]  And I'm honored to be the executive producer on their Loose Change final cut coming out in the next four or five months.
[02:48:36.956 --> 02:48:37.497]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:49.213 --> 02:48:54.658]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.038 --> 02:49:02.685]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.385 --> 02:49:10.429]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.829 --> 02:49:22.275]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House probe to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.555 --> 02:49:26.197]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.518 --> 02:49:28.459]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.799 --> 02:49:32.621]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:45.967 --> 02:50:47.687]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.927 --> 02:50:51.628]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:51.948 --> 02:50:54.149]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:54.669 --> 02:50:58.690]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more.
[02:50:58.890 --> 02:51:00.870]  All in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:05.932]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:06.132 --> 02:51:07.832]  Every time you walk away from your computer
[02:51:08.172 --> 02:51:08.812]  We're good to go.
[02:51:24.258 --> 02:51:24.478]  I think so.
[02:52:03.965 --> 02:52:11.633]  I'll be down at Brightman Books tonight, 7 to 9 o'clock, give a speech, sign books and videos, shake your hand, always love meeting you and seeing you and seeing old friends.
[02:52:12.695 --> 02:52:19.182]  And also tomorrow night, from 7 to 10, I'm going to give a speech, going to have a musical surprise, we're probably
[02:52:20.026 --> 02:52:20.346]  Probably.
[02:52:20.386 --> 02:52:20.747]  We'll see.
[02:52:21.688 --> 02:52:25.311]  And I'm also going to be showing about an hour from my new film, Endgame.
[02:52:25.851 --> 02:52:26.492]  It's not in that part.
[02:52:26.512 --> 02:52:27.272]  It isn't even done yet.
[02:52:27.312 --> 02:52:31.096]  The whole two hours is basically done, but we're sweetening it and adding stuff and taking stuff out.
[02:52:31.376 --> 02:52:32.477]  But you'll get to see that sneak peek.
[02:52:32.497 --> 02:52:33.498]  I'll be able to get your feedback.
[02:52:33.818 --> 02:52:34.839]  The tickets are almost gone.
[02:52:34.859 --> 02:52:35.640]  It only seats like 230, 240 people.
[02:52:37.721 --> 02:52:45.267]  It's almost sold out, so you better drop by in person at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, or go to InfoWars.com and link through and buy tickets online.
[02:52:45.708 --> 02:52:50.031]  Also, you can buy Terror Storm, the second edition, that has now come out.

[02:53:08.206 --> 02:53:11.869]  Your support makes everything we do here possible.
[02:53:11.909 --> 02:53:13.310]  Going back to Jason Burmiss.
[02:53:13.330 --> 02:53:17.354]  Yeah, you guys held up your end of the thing, I have to, about who this is.
[02:53:18.434 --> 02:53:21.275]  Absolutely, and I mean, we really did our homework for this one, Alex.
[02:53:21.295 --> 02:53:23.236]  For all those naysayers and people who said that we didn't do our own research,
[02:53:45.478 --> 02:53:49.082]  We didn't go out and get these interviews ourselves, but we did it this time.
[02:53:49.362 --> 02:53:53.045]  We had the means this time and we went everywhere from D.C.
[02:53:53.085 --> 02:53:59.292]  to Georgia to New York City to New Jersey to get the interviews that are really going to put the lid on this thing.
[02:53:59.752 --> 02:54:02.194]  We've got the people on the scene at the Pentagon.
[02:54:03.208 --> 02:54:07.469]  You know, the people on the scene at World Trade Center, so we've got people on the scene at the towers.
[02:54:07.549 --> 02:54:14.711]  So, you know, these first-hand accounts are powerful for people, and they really open people's eyes to the fact that the media has manipulated their minds.
[02:54:14.991 --> 02:54:15.651]  I can't wait.
[02:54:15.711 --> 02:54:16.731]  It's ultra-massive.
[02:54:16.871 --> 02:54:18.372]  Good job, gentlemen.
[02:54:18.472 --> 02:54:20.272]  And I'm going to give Dylan a call in the next 10 minutes.
[02:54:20.292 --> 02:54:23.293]  Just tell him to... or ask him to call me, okay?
[02:54:23.897 --> 02:54:24.277]  You got it.
[02:54:24.317 --> 02:54:25.438]  We've got something else we've got to work on.
[02:54:25.758 --> 02:54:26.678]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:26.718 --> 02:54:33.280]  This is Jason Burmish and they do a show weeknights here on the GCN Radio Network from 8 to 10 Eastern.
[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:35.561]  I am out of time.
[02:54:35.581 --> 02:54:39.362]  I will see you this evening from 7 to 9.
[02:54:39.782 --> 02:54:40.502]  Brave New Brooks.
[02:54:40.662 --> 02:54:45.804]  It's on the south side of Guadalupe on the UT drag.
[02:54:46.631 --> 02:54:48.253]  And I look forward to seeing you all there.
[02:54:48.273 --> 02:54:53.519]  I'll play about 10-15 minutes of Endgame and again give a speech and sign some books and videos.
[02:54:53.699 --> 02:54:54.960]  It's a great bookstore, great people.
[02:54:54.980 --> 02:54:56.482]  I look forward to seeing you out there tonight.
[02:54:56.722 --> 02:55:02.749]  And then tomorrow night it is the Alamo Draft House sneak peek of an hour, I'm going to air about an hour and five minutes.
[02:55:02.769 --> 02:55:08.375]  I've already got the cut in there, of the two hour film that's coming out in October that is Endgame.
[02:55:09.668 --> 02:55:10.389]  We're good to go.
[02:55:24.838 --> 02:55:25.779]  Out of control, by the way.
[02:55:26.299 --> 02:55:29.441]  From Istanbul to Ottawa, Canada to Austin, Texas.
[02:55:29.881 --> 02:55:31.162]  We went all over the world for this one.
[02:55:31.182 --> 02:55:32.242]  We got footage from all over the world.
[02:55:32.962 --> 02:55:33.883]  And it's something else.
[02:55:33.923 --> 02:55:34.803]  We show you the global elite.
[02:55:34.823 --> 02:55:35.824]  That is tomorrow night.
[02:55:36.464 --> 02:55:41.187]  And don't forget to get Terror Storm First or Second Edition at InfoWars.com right now.
