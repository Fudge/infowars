[00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:06.492]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:08.233]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:10.055]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:11.516]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:13.178]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:17.581]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:22.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:25.688]  Well, it is Friday.
[00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:28.110]  It's been an amazing week for 9-11 Truth and
[00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:37.498]  Well, anyone who wants to bring down the New World Order and expose the corrupt oligarchy that runs our planet today.
[00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:43.741]  We're going to have wide open phones in the first, second, and third hour.
[00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:58.850]  We do have David Bay joining us of Cutting Edge Ministries to talk about just an amazing film, Part 2, that he has produced of a series of three that they're putting together.
[00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:08.444]  The newest one is Riddles in Stone, and it's very professionally produced, and it gets into all the occult imagery in Washington, D.C.
[00:01:08.484 --> 00:01:10.125]  and other areas around the nation.
[00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:26.669]  That DVD has now arrived, is now available at Infowars.com, and we also have some big discounts on it and other films we carry, like The Order of Death, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove Combo.
[00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:30.357]  So we'll tell you more about that a little bit later.
[00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:33.958]  We also have a whole host of clips I want to play.
[00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:49.903]  I've got Jim Cramer of Real Money in the most bizarre interview I've ever seen where he is on this Yahoo video news show.
[00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:56.085]  It's carried by Yahoo News and he's just laying out
[00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:03.034]  How the stock market is a complete fraud and a scam, and almost completely staged.
[00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:04.455]  Now, we know this.
[00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:12.659]  For anybody that actually has studied the stock market or how the global financial system works, we already know this.
[00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:19.922]  But to have Jim Cramer just up there admitting crimes that he has committed
[00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:25.694]  And saying, you know, that he'll never get in trouble for it, it just shows how widespread it is.
[00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:28.936]  So, we'll be playing that clip.
[00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:37.981]  Obviously, there have been big new developments with the Charlie Sheen slash Rosie O'Donnell slash Loose Change soap opera.
[00:02:40.582 --> 00:02:49.427]  Yesterday morning, I learned that someone, or multiple parties, had leaked information to the New York Post, page 6, the biggest gossip column in the country.
[00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:57.588]  That Charlie Sheen was going to be voicing and was involved in Loose Change Final Edition.
[00:02:58.748 --> 00:03:11.774]  Now, I've known about this since its inception, even before the great Loose Change crew knew that Charlie wanted to contact them and talk about, you know, redoing and re-releasing it.
[00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:23.906]  Because we had been talking about the best plan, the best way to get 9-11 Truth in theaters nationwide and we had the idea to just make a full-length feature film with actors.
[00:03:25.362 --> 00:03:53.688]  and uh... obviously it'd be hard to raise fifty a hundred million to make a film that would take that type of quality and be much easier to try to fight the new world order by just reissuing redoing loose change and then boom off the races there they went getting very close to that happening i can't get into details of it but it would be cinematic legendary it would be uh... cinematic history i mean rosebud citizen kane orson welles got blacklisted blackballed
[00:03:55.086 --> 00:04:11.092]  Completely, for making a film that vaguely attacked Hearst Publishing, and William Randolph Hearst, the lord of Hollywood and print, and Hearst Castle and the whole nine yards, there in California.
[00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:17.495]  The king of yellow journalism, the king of popular mechanics today, the king of government black ops.
[00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:20.256]  And he was blacklisted, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.497]  One of the hottest directors in Hollywood.
[00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:31.232]  Well, I mean, putting loose change in theaters, and boy, you ought to see what the redo looks like in the script.
[00:04:31.512 --> 00:04:32.333]  It's very powerful.
[00:04:33.954 --> 00:04:36.196]  Can you imagine putting loose change in theaters?
[00:04:37.316 --> 00:04:44.741]  Well, O'Reilly, in a thuggish, mafioso manner, went on TV last night, very threatening as usual, and said, It's over for yous.
[00:04:45.822 --> 00:04:48.864]  It's over for you, Matthew, you make that film!
[00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:51.266]  You'll never work again!
[00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:52.607]  Or worse!
[00:04:53.906 --> 00:04:55.127]  I mean, total thuggery.
[00:04:55.147 --> 00:04:55.787]  We'll cover it.
[00:04:55.827 --> 00:04:56.648]  We'll play the clips.
[00:04:56.668 --> 00:04:58.569]  I don't know where to start.
[00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:05.153]  It's here.
[00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:10.115]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:18.080]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.812 --> 00:05:25.857]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.257 --> 00:05:37.705]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.006 --> 00:05:41.468]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.948 --> 00:05:43.930]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.073]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:04.276]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:06:04.576 --> 00:06:09.498]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:06:09.758 --> 00:06:14.119]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:23.322]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:06:23.522 --> 00:06:27.143]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:06:27.443 --> 00:06:32.471]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:32.771 --> 00:06:39.522]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:40.543]  What about you?
[00:06:41.281 --> 00:06:46.646]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:04.960]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.281]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:07.562 --> 00:07:17.668]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:20.310]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:55.301]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:24.235]  All right, we're going to shift gears today in the second hour and get into the religion of the elite, a cult architecture in the Western world, predominantly in Washington, D.C.
[00:08:25.355 --> 00:08:29.097]  We're going to do that with David Bay in the second hour.
[00:08:29.297 --> 00:08:32.859]  Very important new film out, part two in there.
[00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:37.062]  We're going to have three parts.
[00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:39.463]  We're now carrying that at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:39.863 --> 00:09:03.492]  Then I'm going to briefly have 9-11 Truth from Philly on, who really upset Alan, I Love Torture, Darchewicz a few days ago, and just did a great job bringing up 9-11 Truth inside a neocon love fest where they were calling for eternal war and a great glorious police state here domestically.
[00:09:05.513 --> 00:09:09.236]  Also, I have really serious news on the immigration front.
[00:09:09.276 --> 00:09:19.263]  They have introduced a modified blanket amnesty plan as a guest worker program, but they're calling it a temporary, temporary guest worker program.
[00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:28.289]  The last temporary guest worker program was complete and total amnesty for anyone who was here in the United States illegally, anyone who can get here for six years.
[00:09:29.432 --> 00:09:39.035]  And it also allowed corporations to fund, on buses, trains, and airplanes, unlimited visas for skilled and unskilled workers.
[00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:44.057]  Two days ago I learned of this legislation that has just been reintroduced.
[00:09:44.097 --> 00:09:50.579]  I have since scanned over the legislation and it is the exact same thing, basically.
[00:09:51.295 --> 00:10:16.023]  It just calls it a temporary temporary, so they're playing more word games, so the end of the nation, I mean if your nation doesn't have borders, and doesn't have controls, and if anybody can come in and be part of the country, and have instant welfare, then you don't have a nation, and this is the globalist plan to kill the country, and they're literally strangling the nation to death right in front of us, the country has turned blue, now it's turning white, the country has passed out,
[00:10:16.893 --> 00:10:18.773]  And they can take their hands off our throat.
[00:10:18.813 --> 00:10:20.814]  We're probably still going to be a brain-damaged country.
[00:10:21.294 --> 00:10:23.334]  I mean, we're probably done for.
[00:10:23.354 --> 00:10:25.655]  It's just how deep will we fall?
[00:10:25.715 --> 00:10:30.096]  How bad will the peon ship that we're all going to enjoy be?
[00:10:30.576 --> 00:10:32.136]  How bad will the police state be?
[00:10:32.176 --> 00:10:34.557]  Do we have any chance of climbing out of this hellhole?
[00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:36.257]  That's being decided right now.
[00:10:37.278 --> 00:10:43.579]  But the globalists have done everything they can to destroy this nation, and they have done an absolutely fabulous job.
[00:10:44.457 --> 00:10:56.122]  And the drug war has gotten 7 million people in the system, and there's more drugs than ever on the streets, and the government ships in the narcotics that launders the money through their banks, and uses that to finance the buy-up of government and so-called privatization.
[00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:58.063]  They're looting everything wholesale.
[00:10:58.163 --> 00:10:59.844]  Total criminality has been unleashed.
[00:11:00.164 --> 00:11:02.105]  Both parties are bought and paid for by the same people.
[00:11:02.826 --> 00:11:05.627]  So we have that as well here in front of us today.
[00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:11.878]  The websites again are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:11.898 --> 00:11:13.961]  They've all been updated today for you.
[00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:15.082]  JonesReport.com.
[00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:17.645]  Aaron Dyke stayed up here until...
[00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:24.369]  I'm told about three in the morning, finishing an article that he put together last night.
[00:11:24.929 --> 00:11:29.151]  Paul Watson wrote another article this morning, which would be around the same time in England.
[00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:31.332]  He's six hours earlier than us.
[00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:38.575]  And they're both excellent stories that need to be put on the message boards and dug and gotten out to people.
[00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:43.778]  I must sound like a complete beatnik when I said they need to be dug.
[00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:49.058]  Some good old boys going, Doug, that's some kind of hippie, yippie, commie.
[00:11:49.738 --> 00:11:55.881]  Doug is, again, one of the biggest websites, and you can vote it up to the top news page.
[00:11:55.921 --> 00:11:59.282]  When I say Doug, that is a nomenclature for that.
[00:11:59.522 --> 00:12:00.703]  Dig it, daddy-o.
[00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:02.604]  Like, totally cool.
[00:12:04.064 --> 00:12:07.686]  Let's go ahead now and get into the news here.
[00:12:09.927 --> 00:12:12.328]  Where to start, first off,
[00:12:13.374 --> 00:12:29.775]  Back on Monday and Tuesday, we did our best to force the mainstream media to report that Rosie O'Donnell, in three separate detailed posts last week, went public on 9-11 truth, detailing that Bush obviously would have been whisked out of the
[00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:46.141]  Elementary school in Florida, that his itinerary was known internationally, there were airports nearby, that it was standard operating procedure to remove him, that he looked like he already knew and they came up and told him, that building 7 was clearly blown up and she gave all the evidence.
[00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:50.722]  She didn't just link to what really happened, as the media said, how dare her just cut and paste something.
[00:12:51.142 --> 00:12:56.324]  She put dozens of links, I mean there was probably 20 something links in one post she did.
[00:12:57.617 --> 00:12:57.777]  I don't
[00:13:20.376 --> 00:13:20.736]  I don't think so.
[00:13:45.271 --> 00:13:48.834]  They tried to set up Sheen and demonize him and run those black ops on him.
[00:13:49.214 --> 00:13:50.315]  That blew up in their face.
[00:13:50.335 --> 00:13:51.576]  He's more popular than ever.
[00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.798]  His show went from number three to number one.
[00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:55.920]  His stock just went up.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.964]  They tried to demonize everybody else to again set the precedent and it's not working.
[00:14:01.004 --> 00:14:03.866]  The dam is breaking on them and they know it.
[00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:07.769]  Total public acceptance that 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.851]  The destruction of their myth
[00:14:10.512 --> 00:14:18.257]  That it was an outside attack, hence we need to lose all our liberties, kill the Bill of Rights, kill America, and have endless war and all these slaves.
[00:14:20.258 --> 00:14:33.147]  And so we did everything we could, you did, the listeners, and you already before this went supernova, and it did go supernova yesterday, you had already pushed it over the edge and mainstream news was starting to break Thursday.
[00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:47.526]  Morning and then you have the added combo and I guess the individuals that linked it to the page six are trying to kill the project, but it looks like it backfired because the publicity is just Accelerating the project now.
[00:14:47.566 --> 00:14:59.370]  I've been told by inside sources and so that's certainly good news But if there's any ever doubt there was ever a doubt that we're literally just seeing old-fashioned, New York gangsterism where
[00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:04.410]  My mom went and saw a documentary that had South by Southwest.
[00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.892]  Let me digress and tell this story.
[00:15:06.992 --> 00:15:07.612]  I didn't see it.
[00:15:08.052 --> 00:15:08.893]  I even forget the name of it.
[00:15:08.913 --> 00:15:10.334]  I was with her the other night.
[00:15:10.354 --> 00:15:15.558]  We went to the rodeo with the kids and she spent like 30, 20 minutes or so telling the story of this film.
[00:15:16.939 --> 00:15:22.824]  It's something I've seen a hundred times in my own life about an upstate New York flea market.
[00:15:23.954 --> 00:15:26.836]  This is where O'Reilly would do nicely in his life.
[00:15:26.896 --> 00:15:32.559]  He'd be the shopkeeper who bullied all the other shopkeepers 150 years ago.
[00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:40.783]  He'd be like a fishmonger and he'd go around intimidating people and bossing them around until somebody stood up to him.
[00:15:42.284 --> 00:15:43.344]  He's that type of person.
[00:15:43.364 --> 00:15:43.525]  A thug.
[00:15:45.587 --> 00:15:46.608]  Nothing against tall people.
[00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:47.930]  I'm of average height.
[00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.473]  I don't care if you're short or tall.
[00:15:50.553 --> 00:15:51.995]  It doesn't matter to me.
[00:15:52.816 --> 00:15:55.920]  Some tall guys like to lean over you and get in your face.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.201]  They think it intimidates you.
[00:15:57.522 --> 00:15:58.623]  You want to break their neck.
[00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:00.125]  That's the instinct.
[00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.329]  Back when I was a fighting man,
[00:16:04.139 --> 00:16:10.081]  I've gotten a few fights, people my own size, and I can never seem to really get turned, you know, get fired up, get turned on.
[00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:20.085]  When some big guy, or a couple of big guys, it was even better, would get me down, boy, it would just, incredible hulk would come out and his bones would start breaking, teeth would start popping out.
[00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:21.466]  Why am I digressing?
[00:16:21.486 --> 00:16:28.849]  I just, I'm sorry, I'm thinking about O'Reilly and his intimidation, his bullying behavior, and old instincts are rising.
[00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:31.350]  Sorry, we fight in the info war here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:32.939 --> 00:16:33.920]  Let me settle down a little bit.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:45.950]  My mother was telling this story as we were driving to the rodeo in the livestock show about how she went to South by Southwest and saw some of the films at the film festival.
[00:16:46.231 --> 00:17:00.323]  She saw this documentary about this spontaneous flea market that had popped up in upstate New York and all these poor people who were there trying to make a living and they were squatting and how this kind of thuggish type
[00:17:01.067 --> 00:17:29.197]  This guy just showed up and started shaking him down and then became the boss and how he would go around intimidating everybody and there was he had no authority he had no power he just had a couple thugs with him and he would tell them he was the boss and tell them he had the authority and then the city wanted to kick him out of this shut down mall parking lot and so he actually helped set them up and get them kicked off of there for it's alluded to you know some type of payoff
[00:17:30.879 --> 00:17:33.520]  And I just thought about that, and I'm not knocking people up north.
[00:17:34.441 --> 00:17:34.761]  Okay?
[00:17:34.781 --> 00:17:39.023]  I mean, there's plenty of boss hogs and small-town corruption in the South.
[00:17:40.304 --> 00:17:43.445]  And there's plenty of the same type of behavior in the West.
[00:17:43.986 --> 00:17:50.329]  But not as bad, because... Well, I mean, I know my Eastern history.
[00:17:50.349 --> 00:17:59.674]  200, 230 years ago, you told somebody up North, or in the South, in the Carolinas, or wherever, that I'm going to shake your business down for money, or I'm going to tell you what to do.
[00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.350]  They would say, let's go out in the street and have a shootout.
[00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.311]  Let's go have a duel.
[00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:12.552]  And, uh, you know, it was the New Englanders and the rest of them, you know, that led the charge against the Redcoats.
[00:18:14.473 --> 00:18:25.215]  But, then, in the last 130 years or so, massive influx of people from Eastern and Central Europe and other feudal states where there was no history of freedom,
[00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:30.506]  Where they were used to having tribal bosses and mob bosses ruling over them.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:58.634]  And so, when you go to New York, you experience the culture of the police bossing you around and telling you you're a slave, and, you know, fat-bellied guys waddling around who are Italian, who everybody thinks they're a gangster and has power and you better be scared of them, and, you know, everyone being threatened, everyone being scared, everyone stooping over and, you know, bending their backs and bending their knees to this type of stuff.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:06.046]  There are many famous cases of classical mafia trying to come into the South or the West and it just didn't work.
[00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:14.755]  Now it does work now because now we're cowardly, chicken neck, land of the coward, home of the slaves down here on average.
[00:19:15.716 --> 00:19:20.500]  And so now you have the mafia starting to flourish and people being ordered around in fear.
[00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:23.003]  I don't understand it.
[00:19:23.123 --> 00:19:23.884]  I mean when somebody
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:25.380]  I don't know.
[00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:47.486]  I'm like a porcupine.
[00:19:47.526 --> 00:19:48.267]  Just leave me alone.
[00:19:48.307 --> 00:19:49.749]  I got a bunch of spines sticking out.
[00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:54.155]  Go find some other, you know, uh, slaves to feed on.
[00:19:54.275 --> 00:19:55.357]  I'm not one of those.
[00:19:55.377 --> 00:19:59.222]  So when we get back, I'll get into O'Reilly and his mafia threats.
[00:20:01.525 --> 00:20:06.808]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:09.089]  Your source for free solar electricity.

[00:20:16.572 --> 00:20:28.118]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[00:20:28.498 --> 00:20:30.179]  Its multi-voltage capabilities
[00:20:30.199 --> 00:20:35.882]  These multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for a flexible source of auxiliary backup power.

[00:21:00.377 --> 00:21:08.643]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.663 --> 00:21:13.486]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.686 --> 00:21:17.589]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the US dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:23.533]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.453 --> 00:21:28.196]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth,
[00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:31.693]  It is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.694 --> 00:21:35.756]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:35.996 --> 00:21:41.360]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.621]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:43.882 --> 00:21:45.743]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.144 --> 00:21:52.988]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:53.684 --> 00:21:56.125]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.206 --> 00:21:59.748]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.509 --> 00:22:04.991]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.551 --> 00:22:13.616]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a sting indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:19.399]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:27.579]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.124]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[00:22:33.005 --> 00:22:36.308]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass.
[00:22:37.209 --> 00:22:41.612]  And offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:42.173 --> 00:22:43.734]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:43.794 --> 00:22:44.134]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:44.194 --> 00:22:44.615]  Call now.
[00:22:44.635 --> 00:22:47.216]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:01.863 --> 00:23:03.904]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.544 --> 00:23:13.466]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:13.906 --> 00:23:21.108]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:27.320]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:38.663]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:39.383 --> 00:23:41.484]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:41.964 --> 00:23:43.584]  For more information, call 702-953-LACE.
[00:23:48.547 --> 00:23:49.048]  We're good.
[00:24:22.885 --> 00:24:24.847]  Welcome back!
[00:24:43.263 --> 00:24:51.189]  Alright, let me make a long story short because I want to come back and cover some more news and take your calls at 1-800-259-9231 here on this Friday edition.
[00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.253]  O'Donald Sheen back at 9-11 Conspiracy Theory.
[00:24:56.273 --> 00:24:58.675]  This is CBS News, New York.
[00:25:00.556 --> 00:25:06.500]  A controversial new film about 9-11 is raising eyebrows not only for its content but for the people involved in the project.
[00:25:06.941 --> 00:25:08.762]  Rosie O'Donald and Charlie Sheen.
[00:25:09.623 --> 00:25:11.184]  Now, literally, folks,
[00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:12.864]  I didn't count them up.
[00:25:12.924 --> 00:25:14.264]  It's like 30 or 40.
[00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:16.486]  I had to stop counting last night and this morning.
[00:25:17.547 --> 00:25:20.388]  I just didn't have time to click through each story, but I saw all the links.
[00:25:21.469 --> 00:25:33.857]  Hollywood Reporter and Variety and just Inside Edition and five Fox TV shows and they're all reporting.
[00:25:36.498 --> 00:25:37.439]  Everybody but O'Reilly did.
[00:25:38.152 --> 00:25:41.834]  That Rosie O'Donnell is making loose change final cut.
[00:25:42.435 --> 00:25:46.677]  That is totally false, and again, I'm... Well, we're in contact.
[00:25:46.737 --> 00:25:47.918]  I'm in contact with folks now.
[00:25:47.938 --> 00:25:53.581]  We're probably going to be able to get some interesting folks on next week, maybe even Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:25:53.922 --> 00:25:54.462]  We'll just see.
[00:25:54.482 --> 00:25:55.222]  We're working on it.
[00:25:57.484 --> 00:26:02.247]  You know, Charlie's only come on my show, and then on Jimmy Kimmel, talked a little bit about Building 7 when he got asked.
[00:26:03.027 --> 00:26:05.909]  And I don't want to... I could twist his arm and get him on, but...
[00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:11.361]  We wanted to get him on again when they were about to launch the film as part of the promotion for it.
[00:26:12.441 --> 00:26:14.543]  But, uh, we'll see.
[00:26:14.563 --> 00:26:15.683]  I'm going to talk to him later today.
[00:26:16.764 --> 00:26:18.125]  But that's not who we're talking about.
[00:26:18.205 --> 00:26:19.085]  You know, somebody else.
[00:26:19.826 --> 00:26:21.146]  Rosie O'Donnell, we're working on it.
[00:26:21.887 --> 00:26:24.568]  We're working on it, so keep your mouth shut!
[00:26:25.309 --> 00:26:27.270]  Anyways, I'm going to stop joking around here.
[00:26:28.531 --> 00:26:30.652]  There's no research they put into any of this.
[00:26:31.644 --> 00:26:43.150]  They're just all saying that Rosie O'Donnell's involved in this now, because the people writing these articles are so dumbed down, a lot of them aren't even operatives, that they can't even differentiate.
[00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:53.056]  They've just heard through the grapevine, through all the emails and stories that have been suppressed, as we've been pushing the last week and a half to get this story out, that Rosie O'Donnell has gone public on 9-11 Truth.
[00:26:53.376 --> 00:27:01.020]  So that must mean she's involved with loose change, because that's kind of become the cultural signpost, or the symbol.
[00:27:03.286 --> 00:27:04.147]  Of 9-11 truth.
[00:27:04.207 --> 00:27:05.027]  I mean, it really has.
[00:27:06.808 --> 00:27:07.388]  And that's great.
[00:27:07.488 --> 00:27:11.170]  We need, though, to have multiple symbols so they can't shoot down individual symbols.
[00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:16.393]  We need to have Terror Storm or Government Sponsored Terror or Inside Job.
[00:27:16.453 --> 00:27:19.135]  Inside Job is one of the other signposts we've got.
[00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:30.930]  It's probably a little bit bigger cultural meme or semantical hieroglyph, signet, logo, than the term was changed.
[00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:38.636]  But Alex Jones has become somewhat of a diminutive form of the symbol.
[00:27:39.077 --> 00:27:41.258]  But we need to get Terror Storm out there.
[00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:42.880]  Again, simple term.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.504]  As well, more juggernauts, more
[00:27:49.685 --> 00:27:53.092]  cultural logos, signets, symbols.
[00:27:55.577 --> 00:28:00.147]  But they couldn't even get that straight that it was not Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:03.581]  But regardless, it's broken now, and they can't stop it.
[00:28:04.001 --> 00:28:04.801]  And that's the good news.
[00:28:04.841 --> 00:28:26.974]  Now, another major national discussion and debate, and the enemies of freedom and liberty are going public, saying there is no inside job, we're all liars, and they said five separate times on O'Reilly last night, in about five minutes, that it's Holocaust denial, people hate Jews, anti-Semitism, Jews, Jews, Jews.
[00:28:27.594 --> 00:28:29.996]  I mean, there's no discussion of Jews in loose change.
[00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.171]  But they kept saying it's white denying the holocaust.
[00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:35.393]  Rosie O'Donnell's denying the holocaust.
[00:28:35.753 --> 00:28:36.973]  They're denying the holocaust.
[00:28:36.994 --> 00:28:37.614]  Holocaust.
[00:28:37.894 --> 00:28:38.314]  Hitler.
[00:28:38.354 --> 00:28:38.714]  Hitler.
[00:28:38.775 --> 00:28:39.415]  Third Reich.
[00:28:39.755 --> 00:28:40.055]  Third.
[00:28:40.095 --> 00:28:40.696]  We're Hitler.
[00:28:40.736 --> 00:28:41.916]  Third Reich propaganda.
[00:28:42.277 --> 00:28:43.317]  Man, everybody's Hitler.
[00:28:43.357 --> 00:28:43.877]  Bin Laden.
[00:28:43.897 --> 00:28:44.278]  Saddam.
[00:28:44.298 --> 00:28:44.858]  Now us.
[00:28:45.578 --> 00:29:00.167]  Now, I want you to remember, and by the way, both these, Diedl, who looks like a mafioso, acts like one, and O'Reilly, the other mafioso, I mean, at the beginning of the show, we didn't send this up to the network, but we should,
[00:29:01.275 --> 00:29:06.217]  He just starts the show going, yeah, shut up, be quiet, it's the O'Reilly factor.
[00:29:07.017 --> 00:29:14.619]  I mean, these are people that want to sit there in their chairs and have some guy act tough, and he literally, his propaganda isn't even good.
[00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:18.561]  It's like third grade level, second grade, first grade level.
[00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:28.964]  He just keeps going, that's your opinion, eh, prove it, eh, eh, eh, oh, the White House wrote a memo saying we torture children, eh, prove it, do you haves it?
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.662]  Shut your mouth!
[00:29:34.363 --> 00:29:37.364]  Shut your pie hole!
[00:29:38.165 --> 00:29:42.567]  Shut your pie hole, eater!
[00:29:42.587 --> 00:29:45.989]  I mean, you're a punk, O'Reilly!
[00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:47.570]  You're a cowardly chicken-neck!
[00:29:51.892 --> 00:29:52.833]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.293 --> 00:29:54.894]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.814 --> 00:29:58.516]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.154 --> 00:30:08.658]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:30:08.878 --> 00:30:12.881]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:30:13.141 --> 00:30:15.322]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:30:15.663 --> 00:30:22.627]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:30:23.007 --> 00:30:25.610]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:29.394]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:30:29.654 --> 00:30:37.542]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:30:37.943 --> 00:30:39.404]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:42.187]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X.
[00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:43.788]  I think so.
[00:31:01.724 --> 00:31:05.326]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:31:05.586 --> 00:31:06.427]  Look no further!
[00:31:06.727 --> 00:31:09.308]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.

[00:31:35.913 --> 00:31:36.253]  I don't know.
[00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:03.742]  This is Elizabeth Border.

[00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:16.431]  War in Iran?
[00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:18.633]  A coming One World Church?
[00:32:19.393 --> 00:32:24.676]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[00:33:20.475 --> 00:33:22.016]  Shut your pie holes!
[00:33:22.156 --> 00:33:25.238]  The O'Reilly Factors and Stoughtonses!
[00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:29.281]  All of you better keep your mouths shut!
[00:33:29.561 --> 00:33:31.822]  I'm gonna call the FBI on ya!
[00:33:31.882 --> 00:33:35.985]  You see, don't forget, we can compile all this.
[00:33:37.185 --> 00:33:39.587]  Every week it seems I'm sent clips or we play clips.
[00:33:41.092 --> 00:33:47.780]  Where Bill O'Reilly gets up there and he says, well I called the FBI on this guy and got him arrested, and yeah, the guy was found not guilty.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.344]  He has a guest on he disagrees with, and he goes, that's it, I'm calling them on you!
[00:33:52.165 --> 00:33:53.506]  The original mafia, the FBI.
[00:33:54.702 --> 00:33:55.763]  I'm going to
[00:34:13.934 --> 00:34:15.696]  You're gonna lose your TV show.
[00:34:15.796 --> 00:34:16.857]  You better stop it.
[00:34:16.897 --> 00:34:17.858]  You better shut up.
[00:34:18.138 --> 00:34:20.761]  The New York Post said, just shut your mouth!
[00:34:20.821 --> 00:34:21.962]  It said, shut up!
[00:34:22.403 --> 00:34:23.364]  Just shut your mouth!
[00:34:23.384 --> 00:34:27.508]  In fact, the exact quote was... I've got the New York Post here somewhere.
[00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.933]  Some celebrities don't know when to keep their traps shut.
[00:34:32.273 --> 00:34:34.195]  And then it goes into all of it.
[00:34:34.235 --> 00:34:35.096]  That's the New York Post.
[00:34:36.832 --> 00:34:38.673]  And then, it's universal.
[00:34:38.713 --> 00:34:40.534]  They say we're Nazis.
[00:34:40.674 --> 00:34:41.054]  Yeah.
[00:34:41.555 --> 00:34:48.498]  The President, who's the puppet who helped carry out the attacks, his grandfather was the admitted head Nazi agent in the U.S.
[00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:54.301]  I mean, don't you love how your Americans, your grandfathers fought Hitler?
[00:34:54.921 --> 00:34:56.903]  Both of my grandfathers were in World War II.
[00:34:57.103 --> 00:34:58.403]  Both my grandfathers enlisted.
[00:34:59.524 --> 00:35:01.445]  One of them was in B-17s in Europe.
[00:35:05.826 --> 00:35:09.728]  The other flew in smaller planes and crashed one and got out of the military.
[00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:14.210]  But the point is that I resent that.
[00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:19.533]  I resent that the media has now turned it around that Americans are Nazis.
[00:35:19.593 --> 00:35:21.093]  Have you noticed everything is Nazi?
[00:35:21.473 --> 00:35:28.137]  And that only the good people that run the media, they're good, they're going to take good care of us, and everyone else is Nazi.
[00:35:28.577 --> 00:35:29.897]  We lost World War II.
[00:35:30.037 --> 00:35:30.978]  We were Hitler.
[00:35:31.661 --> 00:35:33.022]  I mean, you don't believe in global warming?
[00:35:33.142 --> 00:35:33.863]  It should be banned.
[00:35:33.903 --> 00:35:36.064]  It's like denying Hitler and the Holocaust.
[00:35:37.105 --> 00:35:38.967]  You question official stories?
[00:35:39.307 --> 00:35:40.228]  You're like Hitler.
[00:35:40.768 --> 00:35:41.889]  You're not for the Iraq War?
[00:35:41.969 --> 00:35:43.050]  You support Saddam.
[00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:44.011]  He was like Hitler.
[00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:47.833]  Hitler, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler.
[00:35:48.214 --> 00:35:56.120]  In fact, instead of me just saying this, listen to this five-minute clip of O'Reilly last night as he just
[00:35:57.694 --> 00:35:59.255]  Folks, he literally didn't start the piece.
[00:35:59.315 --> 00:36:01.935]  He started the show by saying, shut up!
[00:36:03.075 --> 00:36:04.796]  It's the O'Reilly factors!
[00:36:06.216 --> 00:36:09.157]  And again, I like old folks.
[00:36:09.177 --> 00:36:15.718]  A lot of old folks are great patriots in a way, but his main audience is old people sitting there who are scared, who want their Social Security check.
[00:36:16.339 --> 00:36:18.279]  Oh, and by the way, I ought to write a book about O'Reilly.
[00:36:19.105 --> 00:36:19.805]  Here's the formula.
[00:36:20.105 --> 00:36:21.086]  Terrorists are going to get you.
[00:36:21.186 --> 00:36:22.586]  There's liberal commies everywhere.
[00:36:22.887 --> 00:36:26.588]  He says liberal on the show, on every other piece, like every ten seconds.
[00:36:27.028 --> 00:36:28.629]  The far-left liberals wrote this.
[00:36:28.649 --> 00:36:29.849]  The far-extreme left.
[00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:31.910]  Who's the worst leftist of them all?
[00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:33.271]  And they're not even leftists.
[00:36:33.311 --> 00:36:35.492]  The leftists are all part of the same power structure.
[00:36:36.112 --> 00:36:38.693]  But it's there to entrench and brainwash people.
[00:36:40.009 --> 00:36:43.792]  And then it was DIRTY TEENAGERS DANCING NECKED NEXT!
[00:36:44.252 --> 00:36:45.112]  PORN!
[00:36:45.573 --> 00:36:49.615]  Let's show you lots of blurred out porn video!
[00:36:50.196 --> 00:36:52.357]  And then after that we'll show you more porn!
[00:36:52.878 --> 00:37:05.346]  So it's the terrorists that are going to get you, the liberals are going to get you, but let's sit there and make it okay for the 75-80 year olds to look at porn on the O'Reilly Factor when he's totally obsessed with it and been in all that trouble.
[00:37:05.931 --> 00:37:08.873]  I mean, this is just, it's pervert television, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:10.314]  That's what it is.
[00:37:10.335 --> 00:37:11.375]  I mean, you can assess it.
[00:37:11.716 --> 00:37:19.942]  And it's tailored for a bunch of people who are basically two inches out of the grave, uh, who just want to believe the lies and are totally brain dead.
[00:37:20.122 --> 00:37:21.543]  That's the only audience he's got.
[00:37:21.763 --> 00:37:26.227]  Two and a half million dead people every night that tune into his garbage.
[00:37:26.447 --> 00:37:27.368]  Now, here it is.
[00:37:30.643 --> 00:37:35.086]  In fact, segment tonight, the far left fringe has embraced the conspiracy theory that elements of the U.S.
[00:37:35.126 --> 00:37:36.867]  government carried out the attacks on 9-11.
[00:37:37.147 --> 00:37:38.988]  It's unbelievable, but that's what they're saying.
[00:37:39.569 --> 00:37:41.910]  Now, some mainstream individuals are buying into it.
[00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:50.796]  Rosie O'Donnell discussed it on her blog, and the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, billionaire Mark Cuban, may distribute a movie called Loose Change.
[00:37:50.876 --> 00:37:54.338]  That piece of propaganda may be narrated by Charlie Sheen,
[00:37:54.958 --> 00:37:55.878]  And it says the U.S.
[00:37:55.898 --> 00:37:59.020]  government was criminally negligent on 9-11.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.421]  With us now, Bo Dietl, former New York City detective, knows about the local investigation on 9-11.
[00:38:04.062 --> 00:38:09.904]  From Miami, Gerald Posner, the author of the book, Why America Slept, The Reasons Behind Our Failure to Prevent 9-11.
[00:38:09.924 --> 00:38:11.425]  Alright, Gerald, I'll begin with you.
[00:38:11.445 --> 00:38:14.786]  When you hear this conspiratorial stuff, what goes through your mind?
[00:38:15.971 --> 00:38:17.712]  Well, you know, Bill, it used to surprise me.
[00:38:17.772 --> 00:38:20.813]  Now, nothing surprises me what these wackos can come up with.
[00:38:20.853 --> 00:38:22.654]  What goes through my mind, though, is I get angry.
[00:38:22.954 --> 00:38:27.036]  And then when I see mainstream figures like Rosie O'Donnell, she essentially did a cut and paste.
[00:38:27.476 --> 00:38:29.497]  She took it from one side and put it on her blog.
[00:38:29.617 --> 00:38:30.057]  You know what?
[00:38:30.417 --> 00:38:31.098]  You can't do that.
[00:38:31.118 --> 00:38:33.839]  It would be like putting on something that said the Holocaust didn't exist.
[00:38:33.879 --> 00:38:36.560]  And she has... she should be socially responsible.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.560]  Stop it right there.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.381]  She can't do that.
[00:38:38.461 --> 00:38:38.901]  It's wrong.
[00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:42.913]  He's saying this, it's like saying the Holocaust didn't exist.
[00:38:43.333 --> 00:38:44.714]  She can't do it cut and paste.
[00:38:45.414 --> 00:38:50.838]  Gerald Posner, despite the fact that 90 plus percent of Americans know the government killed Kennedy, all the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:38:51.298 --> 00:38:58.282]  This guy writes these operative books and has given unlimited attention, and he is a former high-level Clinton operative.
[00:38:58.723 --> 00:39:00.163]  Clinton-Gore operative.
[00:39:00.764 --> 00:39:02.705]  I mean, this guy is a thoroughbred operative.
[00:39:03.025 --> 00:39:03.405]  Period.
[00:39:03.465 --> 00:39:04.226]  He worked for him.
[00:39:04.366 --> 00:39:04.666]  Okay?
[00:39:04.926 --> 00:39:05.847]  That's not our opinion.
[00:39:06.937 --> 00:39:09.178]  And remember, a lot of these people are openly on the payroll.
[00:39:09.678 --> 00:39:13.059]  And they also say a detailed study later by Popular Mechanics.
[00:39:13.499 --> 00:39:18.761]  Popular Mechanics is owned by Hearst Publishing, the literal name in yellow journalism, and black ops.
[00:39:19.502 --> 00:39:29.545]  And the first cousin of Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff ran the piece against me and lied to me and said that it wasn't a hit piece and swore it was just an objective piece.
[00:39:30.626 --> 00:39:32.906]  I knew it was a fake straw man debunking.
[00:39:34.087 --> 00:39:34.647]  And NIST,
[00:39:35.675 --> 00:39:40.159]  The federal government and FEMA have said that they don't know why seven fell now and that it could have been bombs.
[00:39:40.259 --> 00:39:40.519]  Okay?
[00:39:40.759 --> 00:39:44.543]  They can't put a report out saying why because they know scientists will look at it.
[00:39:45.363 --> 00:39:49.707]  Underwriting laboratories went public and said that fire couldn't have done that.
[00:39:50.436 --> 00:39:52.898]  Okay, their chief engineer over a whole project.
[00:39:53.218 --> 00:39:55.580]  They had a secret year-long internal test.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:56.940]  They underwrote those buildings.
[00:39:57.381 --> 00:39:59.642]  But no, don't confuse us with the facts.
[00:39:59.842 --> 00:40:03.665]  Then they mention Oklahoma City, excuse me, World Trade Center, the first attack, 1993.
[00:40:04.345 --> 00:40:14.072]  New York Times, CBS News, admitted we have the tapes, we can play them here, we've played them many times, where the informant who they gave the money, the FBI did millions to build the bomb, gave them the detonators,
[00:40:14.472 --> 00:40:16.915]  First you said, hey, we were supposed to build a dummy bomb.
[00:40:16.935 --> 00:40:18.096]  Then you said build a real bomb.
[00:40:18.296 --> 00:40:19.217]  Now I built a real bomb.
[00:40:19.237 --> 00:40:20.378]  Then you gave me detonators.
[00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:22.740]  Now you're going to let the bombing go forward?
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.262]  And they're like, yeah, we're pulling you off.
[00:40:25.003 --> 00:40:29.868]  I mean, the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, like they always do, folks.
[00:40:30.508 --> 00:40:31.910]  I mean, this is incredible!
[00:40:32.991 --> 00:40:33.451]  And this cop...
[00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:39.055]  Uh, former steel worker, I bet he did some arm twistin's, is it?
[00:40:39.816 --> 00:40:43.799]  Uh, he's sitting there, he's been forced over the unions!
[00:40:44.399 --> 00:40:45.580]  And now I'm a cop!
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.442]  And now I'm a contributor to Fox News!
[00:40:49.243 --> 00:40:52.185]  And these are potato chips falling down, is it?
[00:40:52.505 --> 00:40:53.286]  Alright, I'm gonna stop it.
[00:40:54.066 --> 00:40:56.488]  You didn't like me doing hick imitations when I'm a hick, folks?
[00:40:56.728 --> 00:41:00.271]  Well, I'm gonna have some fun with our New York friends, who I love to death, by the way.
[00:41:00.551 --> 00:41:02.573]  I'm just, I just, these guys are thugs.
[00:41:03.193 --> 00:41:03.513]  Okay?
[00:41:03.653 --> 00:41:04.234]  They're cretins.
[00:41:04.992 --> 00:41:12.665]  And they're ashamed, you know, that they represent the great people in New York, by the way, who almost universally know that there's a cover-up and an inside job.
[00:41:12.685 --> 00:41:13.747]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[00:41:13.787 --> 00:41:14.609]  Just go back to the piece.
[00:41:15.236 --> 00:41:16.917]  It goes through my mind, though, as I get angry.
[00:41:17.237 --> 00:41:21.299]  And then when I see mainstream figures like Rosie O'Donnell, she essentially did a cut and paste.
[00:41:21.759 --> 00:41:23.780]  She took it from one side and put it on her blog.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.320]  You know what?
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.381]  You can't do that.
[00:41:25.401 --> 00:41:28.102]  It would be like putting on something that said the Holocaust didn't exist.
[00:41:28.162 --> 00:41:31.523]  And she should be socially responsible to know better.
[00:41:31.964 --> 00:41:34.185]  Mark Cuban, he may be great at making money.
[00:41:34.205 --> 00:41:35.385]  He's worth over a billion dollars.
[00:41:35.405 --> 00:41:39.467]  But this was the guy who said, remember, when Kobe Bryant was arrested, it'll be good for the NBA.
[00:41:39.907 --> 00:41:41.828]  And he says on this issue he's agnostic.
[00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:44.169]  He does things that are good about 9-11.
[00:41:44.269 --> 00:41:46.649]  He also distributes this because it's on the other side.
[00:41:46.689 --> 00:41:47.550]  We don't have an opinion.
[00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:48.370]  But guess what, Mark?
[00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.351]  You don't get to be agnostic on this.
[00:41:50.431 --> 00:41:51.411]  You have to have an opinion.
[00:41:51.791 --> 00:42:02.914]  Either 19 hijackers, Muslim fundamentalists, who wanted to destroy the West, flew those planes into the World Trade Center and into the Pentagon, killing 3,000 people on 9-11, or otherwise you're right and it's a conspiracy.
[00:42:02.935 --> 00:42:03.435]  And you know what?
[00:42:03.715 --> 00:42:05.535]  You don't get to straddle both sides of the fence.
[00:42:05.595 --> 00:42:07.576]  You have an obligation to come clean on this.
[00:42:07.896 --> 00:42:09.037]  And not distribute that film.
[00:42:09.077 --> 00:42:11.178]  The same with Charlie Sheen in narrating it.
[00:42:11.238 --> 00:42:11.899]  It's a disgrace.
[00:42:12.039 --> 00:42:12.299]  All right.
[00:42:12.499 --> 00:42:13.199]  How do you see it, Bo?
[00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:14.640]  You were down here when it happened.
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.182]  You actually worked on the World Trade Center when they were building it.
[00:42:17.402 --> 00:42:20.744]  I was an iron worker back in the late 60s before I became a cop.
[00:42:21.164 --> 00:42:28.229]  And you know, the whole construction of the World Trade Center was heavy, thick steel walls around the outside with six inches of concrete floors.
[00:42:28.529 --> 00:42:32.832]  And what happened that day is when that melted, that went down and it became like potato chips.
[00:42:33.152 --> 00:42:34.753]  And I watched the buildings go down.
[00:42:34.793 --> 00:42:35.953]  It looked like they were imploding.
[00:42:35.973 --> 00:42:36.674]  They were imploding.
[00:42:36.994 --> 00:42:37.875]  Let's stop right there.
[00:42:37.895 --> 00:42:40.477]  How many of the victims' families have we had on here?
[00:42:59.904 --> 00:43:00.545]  How many police?
[00:43:00.605 --> 00:43:01.345]  How many firemen?
[00:43:01.365 --> 00:43:02.566]  How many emergency workers?
[00:43:03.007 --> 00:43:05.709]  And not just on this show, how many interviews have we played from other shows?
[00:43:06.049 --> 00:43:06.890]  How many news articles?
[00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:07.911]  It's in the hundreds now.
[00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:13.836]  Bill Doyle, head of the biggest victims family group, the chairman, the head of the group, lost his son Joey.
[00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:20.275]  Bill Doyle says over half know it's an inside job, and he knows it's an inside job.
[00:43:20.815 --> 00:43:39.391]  I mean, I remember being up in Minnesota visiting Genesis about four years ago, being in the hotel room, I wish I could have taped it, and they said, there's a protest against Bush saying he was involved in 9-11, and it's around the White House, and it showed all these 9-11 truth signs, and victims' families saying Bush did it, Bush knew, around the White House.
[00:43:39.892 --> 00:43:41.473]  But you never see it other than that.
[00:43:42.739 --> 00:43:45.860]  I mean, again, they misrepresent everything.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.921]  And I'm sorry you don't have a monopoly in the media anymore.
[00:43:49.262 --> 00:43:50.282]  The people are learning.
[00:43:51.742 --> 00:43:52.523]  We wrote articles.
[00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:53.523]  Paul did.
[00:43:53.983 --> 00:43:54.383]  Aaron did.
[00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:57.144]  For PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com.
[00:43:57.344 --> 00:43:58.045]  Two different articles.
[00:43:58.085 --> 00:43:58.645]  Go get them, folks.
[00:43:58.665 --> 00:43:59.125]  They're excellent.
[00:43:59.145 --> 00:43:59.765]  Get them out to people.
[00:44:00.406 --> 00:44:01.706]  Every statement's a hyperlink.
[00:44:01.786 --> 00:44:02.946]  Every statement's backed up.
[00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:05.067]  We say the federal government said something, we link to it.
[00:44:05.347 --> 00:44:07.008]  We say a fireman said something, we link to it.
[00:44:07.805 --> 00:44:09.607]  We say that steel melts at a temperature?
[00:44:09.687 --> 00:44:10.227]  We link to it.
[00:44:10.568 --> 00:44:10.988]  You know what?
[00:44:11.028 --> 00:44:12.249]  You don't link to nothing.
[00:44:12.489 --> 00:44:15.492]  You're just counting on a bunch of people to sit there and buy your lies.
[00:44:15.832 --> 00:44:16.653]  Go back to the tape.
[00:44:17.314 --> 00:44:17.854]  The victims.
[00:44:17.894 --> 00:44:20.597]  What about the firemen, the cops that died down there, their families?
[00:44:20.837 --> 00:44:24.561]  And the people down there that lost their husbands, wives, daughters, and sons.
[00:44:25.541 --> 00:44:27.824]  This is complete moron stuff now.
[00:44:28.184 --> 00:44:31.427]  I saw the engine of the plane that was down there on the ground.
[00:44:31.467 --> 00:44:32.528]  It went right through the building.
[00:44:32.908 --> 00:44:39.073]  I saw people down there, when we got down there, when number 7 came down, they say about the building number 7 coming down the same way.
[00:44:39.133 --> 00:44:43.756]  Yeah, because so much heaviness came off from the World Trade Center coming down onto 7.
[00:44:44.397 --> 00:44:48.160]  7 came down, the foundation was all out of whack because of them coming down.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.602]  There could have been more buildings coming down around.
[00:44:50.822 --> 00:44:57.407]  Why it happened that way, only architects and only... Well, we went over it with the popular mechanics, people who have done exhaustive study.
[00:44:58.067 --> 00:45:06.174]  I agree with you that I think that, you know, bringing this stuff up, accusing your own country of murdering your own citizens is painful for people who lost people.
[00:45:06.654 --> 00:45:10.697]  You go back... We're not accusing our own country of that.
[00:45:10.737 --> 00:45:13.760]  We're accusing criminal elements of doing it.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.182]  We didn't say America.
[00:45:16.562 --> 00:45:22.707]  The United States gave black men syphilis over 45 years and let them spread it and tens of thousands died from it.
[00:45:24.073 --> 00:45:29.478]  We didn't say that America radiated over 10,000 American children, tested radiation on them, and killed them.
[00:45:29.658 --> 00:45:30.779]  Declassified public.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.242]  We said criminal elements did.
[00:45:33.482 --> 00:45:34.683]  So shut your mouth.
[00:45:35.023 --> 00:45:37.326]  You're the ones trying to put the blame on America.
[00:45:38.046 --> 00:45:44.132]  It's parasites like you that support the criminals in government that are to blame, you piece of trash, O'Reilly.
[00:45:44.572 --> 00:45:45.053]  Back to it.
[00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:54.598]  I agree with you that I think that, you know, bringing this stuff up, accusing your own country of murdering your own citizens, is painful for people who lost people.
[00:45:55.058 --> 00:46:03.881]  You go back, you go back with the blind cleric, and then with Yusof, the connection was right there when they bombed World Trade Center 1, and they go to... But don't confuse anybody with facts.
[00:46:04.122 --> 00:46:05.082]  Don't confuse them with facts.
[00:46:05.382 --> 00:46:11.303]  But I will say this, Gerald, I believe that if Charlie Sheen puts his voice and name on this, he's through.
[00:46:11.783 --> 00:46:16.224]  I think that people won't watch his television program, they'll hold it against him.
[00:46:16.644 --> 00:46:24.106]  Now you said something earlier, you said it makes you angry when these conspiratorialists put this stuff out.
[00:46:24.406 --> 00:46:27.167]  They have freedom of speech, I mean, you know, they can say what they want.
[00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:28.167]  Why does it make you angry?
[00:46:28.647 --> 00:46:33.113]  It makes me angry, Bill, because they're making up, in some cases, what they call facts.
[00:46:33.173 --> 00:46:34.675]  They're distributing false information.
[00:46:34.696 --> 00:46:35.817]  In many cases, they know it.
[00:46:35.997 --> 00:46:36.298]  Stop.
[00:46:36.418 --> 00:46:37.259]  Okay, what?
[00:46:37.419 --> 00:46:38.180]  What is it true?
[00:46:39.382 --> 00:46:43.227]  Again, Posner, you little Al Gore, Bill Clinton operative, you piece of filth.
[00:46:43.287 --> 00:46:43.828]  Get back to him.
[00:46:46.087 --> 00:46:47.068]  Why does it make you angry?
[00:46:47.688 --> 00:46:51.991]  It makes me angry, Bill, because they're making up, in some cases, what they call facts.
[00:46:52.052 --> 00:46:53.533]  They're distributing false information.
[00:46:53.573 --> 00:46:54.694]  In many cases, they know it.
[00:46:55.034 --> 00:46:56.695]  And the product today is much slicker.
[00:46:56.715 --> 00:47:04.921]  You know, in the old days, you used to get a right-wing revisionist who would stand up and say, oh, by the way, the Holocaust is a myth, and they would just deny it, and we all knew they were crazy, and that was the end of it.
[00:47:06.062 --> 00:47:08.342]  These films that they're putting out are very slick.
[00:47:08.382 --> 00:47:13.743]  They tend to show things in a way that if you watch it and you're impressionable, it's like JFK that Oliver Stone did.
[00:47:13.823 --> 00:47:15.284]  Look, it was a good propaganda film.
[00:47:15.464 --> 00:47:21.425]  I view these often as propaganda films, as good as anything that the Third Reich turned out, but they can change impressionable minds.
[00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:25.466]  So the reason I get angry as a journalist is the same reason you would as a journalist.
[00:47:25.826 --> 00:47:31.207]  You see the historical record here being completely muddied up on a case that should be straightforward.
[00:47:31.267 --> 00:47:32.287]  No, I'm stopping.
[00:47:33.067 --> 00:47:33.768]  So, there you go.
[00:47:33.808 --> 00:47:44.236]  They admit that their false history, their lie, their myth, their religion of government worship and tyranny worship and black ski mask worship is falling apart.
[00:47:44.857 --> 00:47:48.019]  They admit that we're engaging them and beating them and stopping them.
[00:47:48.419 --> 00:47:51.342]  I mean, everybody knows JFK is extremely accurate.
[00:47:51.362 --> 00:47:52.903]  You've been totally disproven, you kook.
[00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:54.081]  Okay?
[00:47:55.041 --> 00:47:55.942]  You know, how dare you?
[00:47:55.982 --> 00:47:57.802]  You're going to be exposed on 9-11.
[00:47:58.142 --> 00:47:59.703]  Charlie Sheen's got more viewers.
[00:47:59.763 --> 00:48:00.983]  He's more popular than ever.
[00:48:01.103 --> 00:48:02.743]  Look at the polls, you twit.
[00:48:03.443 --> 00:48:03.784]  Okay?
[00:48:03.844 --> 00:48:04.724]  You're a loser.
[00:48:05.024 --> 00:48:05.804]  You're going to lose.
[00:48:05.864 --> 00:48:07.104]  You don't control history.
[00:48:07.364 --> 00:48:08.205]  The people do.
[00:48:08.465 --> 00:48:09.325]  You understand that?
[00:48:09.505 --> 00:48:10.765]  You understand that, you rat?
[00:48:11.546 --> 00:48:13.006]  And there he goes back to Hitler.
[00:48:13.046 --> 00:48:14.266]  We're Hitler now, man.
[00:48:14.286 --> 00:48:15.026]  We're slick.
[00:48:15.366 --> 00:48:16.067]  We're Hitler.
[00:48:16.687 --> 00:48:18.867]  No, we've got the news and we've got the facts.
[00:48:18.987 --> 00:48:21.068]  Back to that Al Gore operative.
[00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:23.490]  You hate the country!
[00:48:23.691 --> 00:48:25.152]  You hate the country, O'Reilly!
[00:48:25.192 --> 00:48:25.813]  You're helping kill it!
[00:48:40.646 --> 00:48:42.066]  But most of these people buy into this.
[00:48:42.147 --> 00:48:43.867]  They just hate the country.
[00:48:44.067 --> 00:48:46.388]  You know, it's just something that people have to be negative.
[00:48:46.688 --> 00:48:48.949]  Look, we're all not happy with what the President's been doing.
[00:48:49.489 --> 00:48:50.529]  I was a Republican.
[00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:53.910]  I'm not happy with my President, what he's been doing, and what's been happening.
[00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:54.931]  But you want to know something?
[00:48:55.111 --> 00:48:56.171]  I'm not going to go against
[00:48:56.531 --> 00:48:57.572]  Well, I was a Muslim.
[00:48:57.592 --> 00:48:59.013]  You know, Muslims try to blame it on Islam.
[00:49:16.863 --> 00:49:17.464]  It's devastating to me.
[00:49:17.484 --> 00:49:22.471]  The one most important thing, Bill, is the people that died there on September 11th and their families.
[00:49:22.711 --> 00:49:24.353]  This is a disgrace to them.
[00:49:24.734 --> 00:49:27.718]  And Martin Sheen's kid there, better watch it.
[00:49:27.778 --> 00:49:28.579]  I agree.
[00:49:28.839 --> 00:49:30.061]  I wouldn't watch anything.
[00:49:30.081 --> 00:49:31.543]  We're looking out for you, Charlie Sheen.
[00:49:32.319 --> 00:49:32.919]  Don't do this.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.000]  You're not going to come back from it if you do.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:35.881]  And that's not a threat.
[00:49:36.221 --> 00:49:36.841]  I'm just telling you.
[00:49:36.861 --> 00:49:37.481]  I know the country.
[00:49:37.521 --> 00:49:38.382]  Bo knows the country.
[00:49:38.402 --> 00:49:39.082]  Gerald knows the country.
[00:49:39.102 --> 00:49:40.923]  We won't watch that two and a half kids thing at all.
[00:49:40.943 --> 00:49:41.903]  Not going to do it any good.
[00:49:42.264 --> 00:49:43.744]  Gentlemen, as always, thanks for... Alright.
[00:49:44.385 --> 00:49:46.065]  So, watch yourself.
[00:49:46.085 --> 00:49:51.148]  You know, I'm not going to burn down your grocery store, your gas station here.
[00:49:51.168 --> 00:49:58.591]  But if you hire my cousin Billy and pay him, you know, four or five times regular wages,
[00:50:00.562 --> 00:50:02.163]  Somebody won't burn you down.
[00:50:02.904 --> 00:50:04.125]  How's your daughter doing?
[00:50:04.165 --> 00:50:07.407]  I saw your seven-year-old daughter walking to school the other day.
[00:50:09.469 --> 00:50:10.470]  It's not a threat.
[00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:13.692]  I just want to, you know what I'm saying, I'll look out for her for you.
[00:50:13.712 --> 00:50:16.194]  Would you like me to look out there for you?
[00:50:16.214 --> 00:50:19.436]  I've been really happy to do this for you, dear.
[00:50:19.457 --> 00:50:21.598]  Does that sound good to you, sir?
[00:50:22.239 --> 00:50:24.060]  No, it doesn't sound good to me, sir.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.001]  Okay, sir?
[00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:27.363]  We're going to do what we want, sir.
[00:50:27.583 --> 00:50:28.724]  You understand, sir?
[00:50:28.904 --> 00:50:30.826]  And we're going to clean your clocks, sir.
[00:50:31.106 --> 00:50:32.007]  You got that?
[00:50:32.427 --> 00:50:33.508]  You understand me?
[00:50:35.189 --> 00:50:37.351]  You're not going to stop us, you murderers!
[00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:39.453]  We are coming for you!
[00:50:41.374 --> 00:50:43.276]  We are coming for you, New World Order!
[00:50:43.696 --> 00:50:44.497]  We're committed!
[00:50:44.657 --> 00:50:45.818]  We're ready to die!
[00:50:45.958 --> 00:50:47.359]  You're never going to stop us!
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:52.544]  And all your intimidation and all your garbage won't put your fraud together again.
[00:50:53.644 --> 00:51:00.647]  All the king's horses and all the king's men will not put your stinking New World Order back together again!
[00:51:00.667 --> 00:51:07.950]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.251]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.611 --> 00:51:18.214]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.945 --> 00:51:25.986]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.406 --> 00:51:37.848]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:41.589]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.

[00:54:17.942 --> 00:54:19.642]  Sit down and shut up!
[00:54:19.662 --> 00:54:23.024]  It's disgusting.
[00:54:24.004 --> 00:54:26.785]  Some people are impressed by that mafioso swagger.
[00:54:26.845 --> 00:54:27.225]  I'm not.
[00:54:28.126 --> 00:54:29.166]  This isn't your thing.
[00:54:29.186 --> 00:54:30.507]  This is the American people's thing.

[00:54:36.369 --> 00:54:37.069]  See what happens.
[00:54:37.089 --> 00:54:40.151]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:54:40.171 --> 00:54:41.111]  We got a big guest coming up.
[00:54:41.131 --> 00:54:41.951]  Let's just start going to them.
[00:54:42.011 --> 00:54:43.072]  Matt and Florida, you're on the air.
[00:54:43.112 --> 00:54:43.432]  Go ahead.
[00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:46.095]  Hello, Matt.
[00:54:46.115 --> 00:54:48.276]  Okay, he's gone.
[00:54:48.316 --> 00:54:49.637]  Let's talk to Gary in New York.
[00:54:49.677 --> 00:54:50.477]  Gary, you're on the air.
[00:54:50.497 --> 00:54:50.797]  Welcome.
[00:54:51.578 --> 00:54:52.218]  Hey, Alex.
[00:54:52.298 --> 00:54:52.958]  God bless.
[00:54:53.859 --> 00:54:55.340]  Finally glad to be on your show.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.762]  I just want to issue a warning about a 9-11 Truth member.
[00:54:59.782 --> 00:55:12.908]  I represent New York 9-11 Truth, and there's a character by the name of Wes Jameson that stole our account, that has been selling DVDs at Ground Zero.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.620]  And he's splitting up the whole group.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.761]  So we're basically issuing a warning about him and making it public.
[00:55:20.481 --> 00:55:23.662]  And we expect that... You know, I've met Les a few times.
[00:55:23.702 --> 00:55:25.022]  He seems like a nice fellow, sir.
[00:55:25.402 --> 00:55:27.582]  And I just don't know about this laundry.
[00:55:27.983 --> 00:55:30.983]  And so that's why it's kind of hard for me to... I mean, this is a big show.
[00:55:31.083 --> 00:55:33.864]  People will... This will turn into a whole big issue.
[00:55:33.904 --> 00:55:35.844]  And I know groups split up and people have fights.
[00:55:35.864 --> 00:55:41.145]  And I've heard some inkling about split-ups and things and that's too bad and stuff like that happens.
[00:55:41.765 --> 00:55:43.386]  But anything else on your mind?
[00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:46.006]  What do you think of this whole Charlie Sheen, Bill O'Reilly?
[00:55:46.046 --> 00:55:47.467]  I mean, I'm talking about Bill O'Reilly.
[00:55:47.507 --> 00:55:48.887]  It's all over Fox.
[00:55:48.907 --> 00:55:50.388]  It was covered on Hannity and Combs.
[00:55:51.328 --> 00:55:53.028]  That David Gibson guy.
[00:55:53.048 --> 00:55:54.949]  I mean, it's all over everywhere.
[00:55:55.429 --> 00:55:59.590]  It's sad that they didn't cover our protest by ABC Studios.
[00:56:00.431 --> 00:56:07.973]  And it's very sad how, you know, you look at the TV set and you just want to break it.
[00:56:09.106 --> 00:56:12.548]  I just, you know, it's really see-through for what it is.
[00:56:12.568 --> 00:56:14.088]  There's really nothing to say about it.
[00:56:14.108 --> 00:56:16.909]  These guys are the lowest scum of the earth.
[00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:20.471]  They're going to be tried very soon.
[00:56:20.491 --> 00:56:22.012]  This thing is splitting up every day.
[00:56:22.032 --> 00:56:23.392]  There's new evidence coming out.
[00:56:24.213 --> 00:56:25.693]  They're very worried.
[00:56:25.753 --> 00:56:27.434]  They can't sleep right at night.
[00:56:28.255 --> 00:56:29.497]  And it's really over for them.
[00:56:29.557 --> 00:56:37.947]  And unless they create some big economic collapse, some big disaster in the big open-minded cities like LA or New York, they're gone.
[00:56:38.308 --> 00:56:38.989]  And they're done for.
[00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.392]  I agree with you, sir, and I really appreciate your call.
[00:56:42.412 --> 00:56:45.654]  Is there any website or alternative group you guys are setting up?
[00:56:46.635 --> 00:56:58.363]  Well, we're part of... I'm actually friends with Luke Rutkowski, and... Sure, so the website is... WeAreChange.org, and we're basically working on a website every day.
[00:56:58.403 --> 00:57:01.105]  We're going to make it an everyday news website.
[00:57:01.145 --> 00:57:02.766]  We're adding new materials.
[00:57:02.806 --> 00:57:07.530]  We're working on a new movie, probably going to be called America Double Crossbones.
[00:57:13.952 --> 00:57:21.555]  What do you think of O'Reilly and all these guys with a mafioso?
[00:57:21.916 --> 00:57:22.816]  You better watch it.
[00:57:22.856 --> 00:57:23.756]  You better shut up.
[00:57:23.816 --> 00:57:26.998]  I mean, this is... And then other shows, he says, I'm going to call the police on you.
[00:57:27.358 --> 00:57:29.639]  Well, that's just exposing their tactics.
[00:57:29.659 --> 00:57:31.760]  They're just killing their credibility more and more.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.401]  It just shows how they're very, very nervous.
[00:57:34.501 --> 00:57:36.542]  And this show is just about to collapse.
[00:57:36.602 --> 00:57:37.542]  They're losing ratings.
[00:57:38.603 --> 00:57:39.404]  No, it's in the toilet.
[00:57:40.125 --> 00:57:51.979]  Right, so everything they've ever built on, everything they've ever stood for is about to collapse on them and they're really afraid because the higher up you are, the harder you're going to fall.
[00:57:52.459 --> 00:57:54.362]  Absolutely, I appreciate your call.
[00:57:55.465 --> 00:57:56.406]  Absolutely, yeah.
[00:57:56.466 --> 00:58:00.869]  He's like King Kong up on the top of the Empire States Building and you know how that ends.
[00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:03.210]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan.
[00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:04.371]  Dan in Detroit hung up.
[00:58:04.491 --> 00:58:05.832]  Ken in New York.
[00:58:05.872 --> 00:58:06.612]  Ken, thanks for holding.
[00:58:06.632 --> 00:58:06.993]  Go ahead.
[00:58:07.533 --> 00:58:08.133]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:58:08.173 --> 00:58:08.634]  Good morning.
[00:58:08.834 --> 00:58:09.194]  Good morning.
[00:58:09.214 --> 00:58:09.954]  I'll hold you over too.
[00:58:09.974 --> 00:58:10.995]  We're about to break, but go ahead.
[00:58:11.015 --> 00:58:11.696]  Alright, thanks.
[00:58:13.397 --> 00:58:22.823]  You were talking about the New York Post and we just heard all that propaganda and all those threats on the Rupert Murdoch-Owen Fox Network.
[00:58:23.704 --> 00:58:33.009]  And a post in its March 4th Sunday edition had a full page ad on an interview that they had with Newt Gingrich.
[00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:35.891]  And I think you might be interested in seeing that.
[00:58:36.031 --> 00:58:38.952]  Well, is he still giving the speech of the First Amendment must die?
[00:58:38.972 --> 00:58:40.013]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:40.153 --> 00:58:40.753]  Be right back.
[00:58:41.794 --> 00:58:45.696]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.

[00:58:57.972 --> 00:58:58.613]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.273 --> 00:59:00.333]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.033 --> 00:59:02.174]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.794 --> 00:59:03.614]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:05.274]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.955 --> 00:59:09.856]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.116 --> 00:59:14.197]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.401 --> 00:59:18.022]  Welcome back.
[00:59:18.442 --> 00:59:19.023]  Second hour.
[00:59:19.043 --> 00:59:20.565]  We've got a guest coming up.
[00:59:21.005 --> 00:59:21.846]  Incredible topic.
[00:59:21.866 --> 00:59:22.827]  I'm going to shift gears.
[00:59:22.847 --> 00:59:28.753]  In the third hour, we'll get back to the 9-11 truth and all the other audio clips and stock market fraud news.
[00:59:28.874 --> 00:59:33.959]  I mean, remind me in the third hour, John, to make sure I go to all those clips.
[00:59:34.179 --> 00:59:35.060]  Such important stuff.
[00:59:35.721 --> 00:59:37.042]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:59:37.082 --> 00:59:38.364]  Let's talk to Ken in New York.
[00:59:39.036 --> 00:59:55.379]  He was making a point about the New York Post, which is Rupert Murdoch-owned, Fox News, and it's the same theme, shut up, shut up, you shouldn't have free speech, you're Nazis, you're Hitler, you want to kill Jews, when you question 9-11, which I think you protest too much.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.440]  Why do they keep bringing Jews into this?
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.720]  Pretty obvious what they're doing.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.641]  Me thinks you protest too much, as Shakespeare said,
[01:00:03.583 --> 01:00:05.204]  This is very, very suspicious.
[01:00:05.684 --> 01:00:07.345]  You were going to make a point about their Sunday edition.
[01:00:07.365 --> 01:00:07.725]  Go ahead.
[01:00:08.185 --> 01:00:09.685]  Right, this is on March 4th.
[01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:14.067]  Full page, post-opinion, it's called, of their regular feature.
[01:00:15.047 --> 01:00:16.648]  And it's entitled, Make It Work.
[01:00:17.808 --> 01:00:21.990]  And the subhead is, America, the war, and the world, according to Newt.
[01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:26.532]  So right below that, there's a big picture of him gesturing with his hand.
[01:00:27.212 --> 01:00:31.113]  And I'll just read you the introduction to the interview that they had with Gingrich.
[01:00:31.734 --> 01:00:32.414]  And it says, note,
[01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:43.417]  The Post's editors sat down with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich last week to discuss the state of American politics and government during the War on Terror.
[01:00:44.337 --> 01:00:48.440]  Themes core to his forthcoming book, American Solutions.
[01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:53.843]  And then it gives a basic transcript or an excerpt of their interview.
[01:00:54.323 --> 01:01:02.488]  And basically Gingrich is saying that the War on Terror is what the next president should all be about, that that's the only overriding concern.
[01:01:03.143 --> 01:01:12.308]  And of course he had nothing but praise for Giuliani, and the Post obviously is pushing the Giuliani presidency, and also Gingrich.
[01:01:13.228 --> 01:01:30.878]  And, you know, Alex, I don't scout the papers as much as you do, and maybe your staff, but I bet my bottom dollar that the New York Post, which I used to read until about seven years ago, I couldn't take it anymore, but the New York Post is probably warmonger paper number one in this country.
[01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:32.990]  And I think this is deliberate.
[01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:36.391]  I think Murdoch is just absolutely demented.
[01:01:36.871 --> 01:01:41.613]  Well, we played a clip of him from Davos a few weeks ago where he said they try to control opinion.
[01:01:42.813 --> 01:01:43.033]  Right.
[01:01:43.353 --> 01:01:44.213]  Did you hear that clip?
[01:01:44.994 --> 01:01:45.774]  Yes, I did hear it.
[01:01:46.394 --> 01:01:57.877]  And I urge people just to boycott anything of Rupert Murdoch, whether it's Fox News, whether it's the New York Post, Zondervan Publishing Company, which he bought out a few years ago.
[01:01:58.966 --> 01:02:06.230]  And that's the company that published Rick Warren's book, The Purpose Driven Life, and Rick Warren joined the CFR recently.
[01:02:08.492 --> 01:02:10.393]  And that's all part of taking over Christianity.
[01:02:10.413 --> 01:02:11.854]  Well, undermining it, at least.
[01:02:12.894 --> 01:02:16.316]  I mean, they're taking it over, man.
[01:02:16.396 --> 01:02:24.061]  I mean, most mainline Christians think world governments to be worshipped, that George Bush is to be worshipped, that Israel can do no wrong.
[01:02:24.501 --> 01:02:25.561]  I mean, it's bizarre.
[01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:27.783]  And then laying down to evil is what you're supposed to do.
[01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:40.531]  And lastly, just listening to that interview, or the Fox clip, I heard Posner at least four or five times make references to the Holocaust.
[01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:42.252]  I think four or five times.
[01:02:43.113 --> 01:02:55.142]  Anybody like you, or anybody else who wants more facts to be known about 9-11, or more research to be known, we are all basically complicit in a way, in some kind of mass murder scheme.
[01:02:56.034 --> 01:02:56.715]  Well, that's it.
[01:02:57.215 --> 01:03:00.979]  And we're involved in Hitler propaganda, as slick as Hitler's.
[01:03:01.179 --> 01:03:02.060]  We're just like them.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.383]  Yeah, just like them.
[01:03:05.443 --> 01:03:08.926]  I mean, this is off the charts, mindless.
[01:03:09.326 --> 01:03:11.128]  But listen, America's a changing place.
[01:03:11.168 --> 01:03:12.069]  I've got an article here.
[01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:17.293]  And it says Florida City to seize homes over $5 parking ticket.
[01:03:18.214 --> 01:03:20.056]  And this is mainstream news.
[01:03:21.602 --> 01:03:23.203]  This is the Brooksville City Council.
[01:03:23.684 --> 01:03:25.004]  I have their website.
[01:03:25.325 --> 01:03:26.766]  I'm going to get these folks on next week.
[01:03:27.466 --> 01:03:31.869]  I mean, look, petty things will mean ten years in prison in a work camp.
[01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:33.610]  Petty things.
[01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:37.653]  I mean, in the Soviet Union, you didn't go to, you didn't lose your house for a five dollar parking ticket.
[01:03:38.634 --> 01:03:45.718]  And they'll just have lots of local bullies on radio and TV, telling everybody, shut up, shut up, it's good.
[01:03:46.259 --> 01:03:47.379]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:47.419 --> 01:03:48.040]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:48.695 --> 01:03:49.855]  Yeah, I'm in the New York Post.
[01:03:50.196 --> 01:03:52.816]  Look, Tony Snow at Fox is now the White House press person.
[01:03:53.837 --> 01:03:57.258]  It's here.
[01:03:57.418 --> 01:04:02.199]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:10.162]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.911 --> 01:04:17.956]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.356 --> 01:04:29.804]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.105 --> 01:04:33.687]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.047 --> 01:04:36.009]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.329 --> 01:04:40.172]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:55.307 --> 01:05:57.408]  Does this sound bring on a sudden onset of fear?
[01:05:57.868 --> 01:05:59.788]  A fear of not knowing who's on the other end?
[01:06:00.068 --> 01:06:04.529]  Do you avoid picking up the phone knowing it's just going to be another harassing phone call from a debt collector?
[01:06:04.689 --> 01:06:09.151]  Do you resent your daily trips to the mailbox knowing it will be flooded with notices from creditors?
[01:06:09.451 --> 01:06:12.411]  Over 1 million credit card holders will declare bankruptcy this year.

[01:06:26.992 --> 01:06:28.892]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:06:29.612 --> 01:06:32.793]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:06:33.433 --> 01:06:39.895]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:06:58.268 --> 01:07:02.469]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.

[01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:05.590]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:10.191]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.431 --> 01:07:14.552]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.713 --> 01:07:22.955]  I remember about a year ago being sent Part 1
[01:07:25.712 --> 01:07:33.219]  In a series, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1 of the Secret Mysteries series.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:39.586]  And I mean, this was Discovery Channel, History Channel quality, but it was even better.
[01:07:41.167 --> 01:07:42.929]  And I've known David Bay for many years.
[01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:46.653]  I don't know, five, six, seven or so.
[01:07:47.153 --> 01:07:47.694]  I don't remember.
[01:07:48.154 --> 01:07:49.035]  He can probably tell you.
[01:07:49.907 --> 01:07:51.669]  And I called him up and I said, who made this?
[01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:55.492]  He goes, well we found this really good director and film producer and he financed it.
[01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:59.916]  And he made Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings Volume 1.
[01:07:59.996 --> 01:08:00.597]  It was excellent.
[01:08:00.637 --> 01:08:04.300]  Well, a couple days ago the DVDs came in because I knew I wanted to carry it.
[01:08:06.022 --> 01:08:08.123]  And so I got a copy of the DVD to watch.
[01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:11.106]  And I was just, it's even better.
[01:08:12.127 --> 01:08:12.828]  If that's possible.
[01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:27.057]  And I've always meant to make a film about, I mean actually I have, a small section of the Order of Death that I made two years ago, a year and a half ago, a small section of that 46 minute film
[01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:32.391]  does get into the occult architecture in D.C.
[01:08:32.431 --> 01:08:33.072]  and other areas.
[01:08:33.392 --> 01:08:46.861]  I've done a few special reports where we show how they always put the goddess Andromeda or the goddess Diana or Eulogia looking down over war memorials in D.C.
[01:08:46.922 --> 01:08:47.522]  or in Europe.
[01:08:47.802 --> 01:08:49.303]  That's the sacrifice to her.
[01:08:49.323 --> 01:08:54.427]  I had Russian TV here with me a few months ago.
[01:08:55.203 --> 01:08:56.364]  Yeah, I think.
[01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:20.328]  And it's also admitted that the Masons got in an argument with the folks in D.C.
[01:09:20.348 --> 01:09:31.214]  because there's these little internal courts they have about their... because they believe architecture gives them power and these are like their temples, these ambulances, and they put them on key positions on the Earth's surface.
[01:09:31.374 --> 01:09:33.995]  I mean, this is crazy stuff, okay?
[01:09:34.476 --> 01:09:36.697]  I'm not saying I believe this stuff.
[01:09:37.217 --> 01:09:38.278]  I'm saying they do.
[01:09:38.618 --> 01:09:45.502]  It'd be like if I was a prosecutor prosecuting a hillside strangler who had a pentagram card in his hand and worshipped Lucifer publicly.
[01:09:46.703 --> 01:09:50.085]  I mean, I don't worship Lucifer, but he does.
[01:09:51.566 --> 01:09:53.748]  It's crazy, but truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:09:55.329 --> 01:09:58.631]  And there's this whole underworld out there that's real.
[01:09:59.852 --> 01:10:02.014]  And if you go to D.C., it's the worst I've ever seen.
[01:10:02.054 --> 01:10:04.196]  Well, Paris is worse worldwide.
[01:10:04.236 --> 01:10:07.458]  I mean, it's the worst, but London's next, and then D.C.
[01:10:08.679 --> 01:10:14.063]  But the globalists and the New World Order Illuminati crowd, with their frontmen, the Masons,
[01:10:15.422 --> 01:10:17.504]  We're able to kind of build D.C.
[01:10:17.564 --> 01:10:17.984]  anew.
[01:10:18.744 --> 01:10:22.747]  So you could argue that it's got the most Masonic influence, but I don't know.
[01:10:23.148 --> 01:10:25.449]  I've been in other foreign cities and it's just ridiculous.
[01:10:25.649 --> 01:10:26.630]  You ought to see Ottawa.
[01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:32.214]  That thing's like something out of Lord of the Rings, what a fortress looks like in Mordor.
[01:10:32.594 --> 01:10:35.637]  Skulls, demons everywhere, pentagrams.
[01:10:36.437 --> 01:10:38.719]  I mean, it's un... I mean, that thing's like a...
[01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:46.567]  You ever lived in a big city and when you were younger went to one of the big fancy haunted houses where they just built this big scaffolding of a dark tower?
[01:10:46.947 --> 01:10:49.169]  I mean, that's what Ottawa looks like.
[01:10:49.509 --> 01:10:50.409]  Look, I want to go to our guest.
[01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:51.390]  I'm already digressing here.
[01:10:51.430 --> 01:11:02.618]  My point is that this professionally, and it shows both sides, walks through it and shows the history and the admissions and then
[01:11:03.653 --> 01:11:17.280]  All of the occultism, you know, the National Press Clubs, the owl with the staff and the Aladdin's lamp, the three things they use in the rituals at Bohemian Grove, and then of course the press founded that, and the Western Press Club did.
[01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:23.552]  And you go to the Supreme Court building and it's devils and owls and gargoyles and everything else.
[01:11:23.892 --> 01:11:35.558]  They admit that the Canadian Parliament, this is mainstream news, has the sun calculation of 666 in its major room and has an Ark of the Covenant redo inside a marble box.
[01:11:35.939 --> 01:11:40.941]  But when they were asked about it, they admitted they've got a... I mean, these people, folks, they are obsessed with this.
[01:11:43.448 --> 01:11:45.170]  And their architecture is everywhere.
[01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:47.712]  And so let's play the trailer to Riddles in Stone.
[01:11:47.752 --> 01:11:49.993]  We've got it for you at Infowars.com.
[01:11:50.574 --> 01:11:53.316]  If you want to order it, we just started carrying it.
[01:11:53.356 --> 01:11:54.097]  It just came out.
[01:11:55.338 --> 01:11:57.299]  We hope that you get Riddles in Stone.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.583]  And we hope you get it out to everybody at $29.95, because it cost a lot for them to make.
[01:12:02.083 --> 01:12:04.105]  And we appreciate them allowing us to carry it.
[01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:10.770]  Now, if you get it, we've got a deal where you can get a discount on the Order of Death when you do get it, if you'd like.
[01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:12.872]  If you haven't gotten the Order of Death, which is a pretty good film I made,
[01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:13.930]  We're good to go.
[01:12:33.112 --> 01:12:44.021]  You also get my original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, cut from 2 hours and 5 minutes down to 130 minutes, with new information added and re-digitally mastered.
[01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:45.943]  We went to the original tapes we had.
[01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:50.707]  When I got back from Bohemian Grove in 2000, I ran in with the digital tapes, but edited
[01:12:52.488 --> 01:12:56.591]  Digital, linear, editing, three-quarter inch deck, folks.
[01:12:56.611 --> 01:12:58.913]  And I did it in two weeks while I was getting death threats.
[01:12:59.353 --> 01:13:01.034]  I mean, I literally almost didn't sleep.
[01:13:01.115 --> 01:13:02.295]  I'd do the radio show.
[01:13:03.816 --> 01:13:05.398]  I'd have to get into the studio when I could.
[01:13:05.458 --> 01:13:07.599]  I'd stay up there all night because nobody was there at night.
[01:13:07.859 --> 01:13:10.061]  And it was a decent film, but I've redone that one, too.
[01:13:11.242 --> 01:13:17.546]  But I'm going to shut up and play the trailer, and then we're going to go to David Bay, who was the visionary on getting this done.
[01:13:17.566 --> 01:13:20.789]  And we're going to have the director on next week, by the way.
[01:13:21.549 --> 01:13:22.429]  Who's a genius.
[01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:25.671]  Let's go ahead and play the trailer for Riddles in Stone.
[01:13:25.911 --> 01:13:28.371]  You can watch it up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:13:28.412 --> 01:13:28.832]  Here it is.
[01:13:31.433 --> 01:13:34.874]  We have a unique nation, a republic, like no others.
[01:13:36.414 --> 01:13:37.995]  And so this must be unique.
[01:13:39.755 --> 01:13:41.356]  This will be our nation's capital.
[01:14:08.118 --> 01:14:14.223]  Clearly, a lot of the designers and architects of Washington D.C.
[01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:19.688]  were masons, starting with George Washington himself, who was a guiding force.
[01:14:20.888 --> 01:14:26.393]  I do not believe that there are any secret plans or designs related to Freemasonry.
[01:14:26.633 --> 01:14:29.916]  Well, it was definitely designed according to Masonic principles.
[01:14:29.996 --> 01:14:31.338]  The streets are laid out that way.
[01:14:31.638 --> 01:14:33.120]  The buildings are laid out that way.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:39.906]  Conspiracists are always looking under their bed for evidence that there is some vast conspiracy.
[01:14:39.926 --> 01:14:44.751]  And Masons may very well say that they really aren't influential as far as Washington, D.C.
[01:14:44.831 --> 01:14:47.634]  is concerned, and yet the cornerstone was laid by Masons.
[01:14:48.916 --> 01:14:55.467]  You see the inverted five-pointed star, which is the Goat of Nimbus, built into the streets of Washington, D.C.
[01:14:55.567 --> 01:14:59.193]  No, there are no satanic plans in the street plans of Washington, D.C.
[01:15:01.101 --> 01:15:03.743]  A pentagram to the north of the White House.
[01:15:03.803 --> 01:15:06.925]  But the streets don't actually connect to form a pentagram.
[01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:07.945]  This is geometry.
[01:15:08.566 --> 01:15:09.066]  It happens.
[01:15:09.086 --> 01:15:11.287]  No one can have that happen accidentally.
[01:15:11.387 --> 01:15:15.330]  The anti-Masons want to show that there is some demonic conspiracy.
[01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:16.451]  It's veil worship.
[01:15:16.671 --> 01:15:17.691]  That's what you're involved in.
[01:15:18.032 --> 01:15:20.973]  That is what Masonry is based upon, the power of the dragon.
[01:15:21.113 --> 01:15:21.554]  In a word,
[01:15:22.214 --> 01:15:22.735]  Hogwash.
[01:15:22.755 --> 01:15:27.159]  When you want to talk about symbols and what they mean, you really have to look at who's authored these symbols.
[01:15:27.339 --> 01:15:29.280]  The symbols, they're always multiple levels.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.122]  Symbols reveal and they conceal.
[01:15:32.023 --> 01:15:34.285]  And that's why they're used and that's why they're so important.
[01:15:34.605 --> 01:15:39.369]  They reveal to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.
[01:15:39.389 --> 01:15:43.713]  If I would have told you this 15 years ago, I might have gotten shot.
[01:15:43.953 --> 01:15:45.915]  When they're shooting at you, you know they're serious.
[01:16:14.881 --> 01:16:15.561]  Alright, folks.
[01:16:16.242 --> 01:16:20.164]  David Bay, a long intro, but I tell ya, this is just fantastic.
[01:16:20.684 --> 01:16:26.947]  Out of the gates, tell us about yourself, and then tell us about the director, and how Part 1 and now Part 2 got made.
[01:16:27.327 --> 01:16:31.449]  And I love it when, as the parts get better as you go, that's not normally the case.
[01:16:31.469 --> 01:16:33.470]  But congratulations, and good work.
[01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:34.230]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:16:34.671 --> 01:16:35.751]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:16:35.871 --> 01:16:37.212]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[01:16:38.212 --> 01:16:41.594]  The research behind
[01:16:42.259 --> 01:16:50.126]  These seven series of films that we are going to produce all under the Secret Mysteries of America's Beginning headline.
[01:16:50.146 --> 01:16:50.867]  Then I was ignorant.
[01:16:50.887 --> 01:16:51.567]  It's not three.
[01:16:51.767 --> 01:16:52.608]  Was it originally three?
[01:16:52.668 --> 01:16:53.349]  Now it's going to be seven?
[01:16:53.549 --> 01:16:54.630]  It was originally four.
[01:16:55.050 --> 01:16:55.311]  Okay.
[01:16:55.331 --> 01:17:08.402]  There is so much material that we just feel like we have to extend this because there's just so much more material we couldn't fit into the first video or the second video.
[01:17:09.848 --> 01:17:12.270]  And so we are now going to make seven.
[01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:16.972]  But this represents 14 years of research.
[01:17:17.413 --> 01:17:24.617]  And like I said, last year when we talked, I found this excellent filmmaker, Chris Pinto.
[01:17:24.917 --> 01:17:30.761]  He's a Christian filmmaker, probably the only one in the industry, but he's really, really terrific.
[01:17:31.161 --> 01:17:35.904]  I'm so pleased the way he took the material that I presented him and
[01:17:36.849 --> 01:17:45.264]  And some material that he found on his own and just, uh, uh, you know, uh, he, he, uh, weaved into a magnificent storyline, I think.
[01:17:46.067 --> 01:17:48.909]  Now, again, the Loose Change guys have put out a powerful film.
[01:17:49.449 --> 01:17:54.591]  You are the guy that put out some documentaries and Get Better and Better and basically an online video and bookstore.
[01:17:54.952 --> 01:17:55.672]  You did this.
[01:17:56.132 --> 01:18:00.094]  I mean, I think that you're showing how you can trailblaze and, you know, tip my own hat.
[01:18:00.114 --> 01:18:01.135]  I have a few feathers here.
[01:18:01.175 --> 01:18:02.996]  I've kind of trailblazed a few things myself.
[01:18:03.036 --> 01:18:03.716]  That's right, you have.
[01:18:03.916 --> 01:18:07.418]  But the point here is, is everybody can do this with God's guidance.
[01:18:07.478 --> 01:18:11.120]  If you ask God to lead, guide, and direct you, and I know you've done that, David Bay.
[01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:13.263]  Yes, I mean absolutely.
[01:18:13.303 --> 01:18:15.925]  Cutting Edge Ministries has been the Lord's work ever since I started in 1989.
[01:18:23.009 --> 01:18:29.351]  But this is the film that I felt that the Lord wanted me to put out.
[01:18:30.312 --> 01:18:33.413]  It shows masonry for what it really is.
[01:18:33.533 --> 01:18:43.936]  And it shows that while America's cultural foundation is people's values, we're Christian, it's leaders, we're secret society pagans.
[01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:48.637]  And what I wanted to do is... Well stay there, stay there, we're going to get back.
[01:18:48.717 --> 01:18:50.398]  And you know what, I'm going to dig that clip up.
[01:18:51.252 --> 01:18:52.353]  Of the Hellfire Club.
[01:18:52.714 --> 01:18:53.134]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.655 --> 01:18:54.436]  Terrorism!
[01:18:54.576 --> 01:18:55.337]  Terrorism!
[01:18:55.417 --> 01:19:01.504]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:19:01.744 --> 01:19:03.326]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:19:03.586 --> 01:19:06.029]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:19:06.429 --> 01:19:21.001]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:21.041 --> 01:19:21.361]  government.
[01:19:21.541 --> 01:19:23.382]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:19:23.723 --> 01:19:29.627]  It's presented by a housewife, as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:29.787 --> 01:19:34.211]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:19:43.998 --> 01:19:46.139]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:20:00.094 --> 01:20:04.918]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:05.118 --> 01:20:07.860]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.001]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:10.362 --> 01:20:14.965]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:15.886 --> 01:20:23.151]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:27.194]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:29.344 --> 01:20:32.807]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:35.070]  Call for your copy today.
[01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:37.512]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.573 --> 01:20:44.419]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:20:45.039 --> 01:20:45.200]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:45.500]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.809 --> 01:20:56.231]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:20:56.751 --> 01:21:00.073]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:21:00.433 --> 01:21:03.375]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:21:03.655 --> 01:21:10.039]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:14.502]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:21:14.742 --> 01:21:19.124]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:21:19.265 --> 01:21:21.866]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:21:21.886 --> 01:21:24.667]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:21:25.128 --> 01:21:27.669]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:31.951]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:21:32.011 --> 01:21:32.852]  Treasury bonds.
[01:21:33.132 --> 01:21:37.773]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:21:37.953 --> 01:21:42.754]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:21:42.994 --> 01:21:51.376]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:21:52.756 --> 01:21:58.777]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:21:59.338 --> 01:22:01.578]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business,
[01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:06.488]  We're good.
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:25.640]  I think so.
[01:22:57.085 --> 01:22:58.774]  Day after day, alone.
[01:23:03.869 --> 01:23:04.750]  Welcome back!
[01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:10.175]  David Bay of Cutting Edge Ministries is our guest.
[01:23:29.005 --> 01:23:34.427]  We are carrying his new film, Riddles in Stone, Part 2 of the Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings.
[01:23:35.328 --> 01:23:37.248]  An unbelievably good film.
[01:23:38.049 --> 01:23:46.852]  First off, I wanted to play a clip from about a four-year-old TV program about Benjamin Franklin, who ended up dying in England, and the satanic worship he enjoyed.
[01:23:47.313 --> 01:23:49.193]  Now, this is admitted mainstream news.
[01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:52.455]  For anyone who knows history, the general public will laugh all day.
[01:23:52.515 --> 01:23:55.176]  Franklin was really a British agent, all evidence shows.
[01:23:55.236 --> 01:23:57.337]  Tried to throw the war, but he failed.
[01:23:57.377 --> 01:23:57.737]  Here it is.
[01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:05.059]  America was born in rebellion, and a few of its greatest icons made alliances with the host of hell.
[01:24:08.901 --> 01:24:21.965]  In the late 1700s, a group of Englishmen formed the first Hellfire Club, a fraternity dedicated to drinking, sex, and at times, ridiculing Christianity and mocking its sacred rituals.
[01:24:23.408 --> 01:24:28.150]  Members met at ruined monasteries to revel in black masses and drunken orgies.
[01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:35.032]  An occasional participant was the American ambassador to Great Britain, Benjamin Franklin.
[01:24:36.713 --> 01:24:40.414]  Alright, David Bay, your film goes a lot deeper than the History Channel.
[01:24:40.474 --> 01:24:41.735]  This is documented.
[01:24:41.795 --> 01:24:44.155]  Break down the film and why folks need to get it.
[01:24:44.976 --> 01:24:51.538]  Well, the film documents the fact that our founding fathers
[01:24:52.599 --> 01:24:59.864]  We're following the Illuminati plan set forth by Sir Francis Bacon, Queen Elizabeth, when they founded this nation.
[01:25:00.364 --> 01:25:12.392]  And that plan was that America was to be the leading nation of all the nations of the world, gradually leading them into a global economy, a global religion, and a global government, a global dictatorial government.
[01:25:13.013 --> 01:25:14.594]  And then, you know,
[01:25:19.824 --> 01:25:35.596]  You know, uh, phase out of it, you know, once it's led the world into the, you know, into this new global system, then America, America's influence would phase out, America would shrink to just another, just one of the, just one of the nations, you know, in the, in the global system.
[01:25:35.636 --> 01:25:36.156]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:36.416 --> 01:25:45.963]  Use the United States as an engine for global hegemon and empire, working with the British Empire, and then phase those out into the larger global government structure.
[01:25:45.983 --> 01:25:46.244]  Right.
[01:25:46.644 --> 01:25:48.125]  But once that's done,
[01:25:49.224 --> 01:25:58.409]  Then, the Illuminati plan is to stage a Masonic Christ, and he will then lead the world into a thousand years of peace.
[01:25:58.869 --> 01:26:02.671]  And they really believe this, and they've written books about this.
[01:26:02.731 --> 01:26:08.954]  Supreme Grand Headmasons have said this, and that they believe Lucifer is Christ, or that Christ is really the devil.
[01:26:09.354 --> 01:26:14.817]  Well, they believe in the as above, so below maxim, which means, among other things,
[01:26:15.382 --> 01:26:19.645]  Means that Lucifer and Jesus Christ are opposite but equal gods.
[01:26:20.586 --> 01:26:24.569]  And they serve Lucifer, and not Jesus.
[01:26:24.589 --> 01:26:30.254]  But they don't look upon Jesus as being omnipotent God, as the Bible says, and Lucifer being a beaten foe.
[01:26:30.374 --> 01:26:30.634]  Oh no!
[01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:34.067]  They believe that Lucifer is an equal to Jesus Christ.
[01:26:34.407 --> 01:26:40.212]  Absolutely, and that's admitted, and they feel the power of Lucifer seething in their hands in the words of Albert Pike.
[01:26:40.633 --> 01:26:44.256]  And they believe they're energized by this power.
[01:26:44.296 --> 01:26:48.360]  Then you've got the general public who sees the pyramid symbols, the all-seeing-eye symbols,
[01:26:50.021 --> 01:26:53.062]  Interlocking triangles, symbols, hundreds of Illuminati symbols.
[01:26:53.322 --> 01:26:54.182]  They're everywhere.
[01:26:54.262 --> 01:26:57.082]  It's a whole language and the general public isn't even aware.
[01:26:57.342 --> 01:26:58.923]  How does architecture come in?
[01:26:58.963 --> 01:27:01.423]  Because we know it's their central temple.
[01:27:02.263 --> 01:27:02.503]  Right.
[01:27:05.244 --> 01:27:09.745]  We discovered that the architecture of Washington DC tells this story.
[01:27:10.185 --> 01:27:14.326]  If you know what you're looking for, it tells this story.
[01:27:14.486 --> 01:27:16.666]  That America is to lead the nations of the world
[01:27:17.122 --> 01:27:23.908]  To a man whom they call, you know, not only their Masonic Christ, but they call him Destiny.
[01:27:24.649 --> 01:27:42.364]  And when a Luciferian creates a symbol, whether it's on a piece of paper, or whether it's on the ground as the street layout, or whether it's a building, they believe, not you and I believe it, but they believe that that
[01:27:45.038 --> 01:27:57.914]  Uh, that, uh, that symbol, that design, that building, that street design, uh, begins to pulsate with a cold power from the supernatural realm 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:27:58.595 --> 01:28:03.040]  And that that power will move the, move
[01:28:03.644 --> 01:28:08.528]  The world moved the nation in the direction that they want it to be moved.
[01:28:08.548 --> 01:28:11.710]  Yeah, they believe it's a focusing tool or a vortex.
[01:28:12.911 --> 01:28:14.132]  A giant amulet.
[01:28:15.433 --> 01:28:18.175]  And they believe further that when they dedicate
[01:28:18.675 --> 01:28:20.356]  We're on the march.
[01:28:20.816 --> 01:28:22.196]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.939 --> 01:28:50.721]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.843 --> 01:28:56.465]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[01:28:56.606 --> 01:29:02.750]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[01:29:02.890 --> 01:29:12.037]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[01:29:12.257 --> 01:29:13.018]  It's called Slender FX.

[01:30:07.731 --> 01:30:11.417]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[01:30:11.678 --> 01:30:19.249]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[01:32:54.254 --> 01:32:59.936]  If you'd like to get it as a combo deal with Secret Mysteries of America, we've got a little discount.
[01:33:00.396 --> 01:33:07.057]  We've got a huge discount if you get it with my film, The Order of Death, that is pretty darn good if I don't say so myself.
[01:33:07.637 --> 01:33:14.099]  And it comes free with a whole other film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, remastered, recut, and updated in 2005.
[01:33:15.619 --> 01:33:30.540]  So you get the new film Order of Death with Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grub on the same DVD over three hours and then you two films are not over it's two and a two and a half hours now because we cut some out that's right to make it
[01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:31.558]  No, I don't.
[01:33:54.153 --> 01:33:56.915]  Reynolds and Stone's Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[01:33:56.935 --> 01:34:03.880]  will continue to explore the fascinating history behind the origins and focus of the world's most powerful nation, America.
[01:34:04.841 --> 01:34:14.288]  And it is such important work, and we're blessed to have David Bay and his director, who together collaborated to make Part One, which I thought was, again, amazing.
[01:34:15.903 --> 01:34:19.550]  It's, they're both good, but this one I've got to say is stronger.
[01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:25.880]  Just because it's more, you know, it's closer into history, it's closer to our time, and you can see the evidence everywhere.
[01:34:28.064 --> 01:34:29.965]  And again, this is admitted by the elites.
[01:34:30.005 --> 01:34:35.269]  They're totally... I mean, Tony Blair every day is possessed by the great white spirit, he calls it.
[01:34:35.309 --> 01:34:36.430]  He flops around on the ground.
[01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:40.012]  He goes to weird Aztec temples and does rituals and goes to Greece and does them.
[01:34:40.592 --> 01:34:45.175]  Ronald Reagan gave speeches down to the exact minute of when the astrologer said, do it.
[01:34:45.235 --> 01:34:47.237]  That's kind of low-level occult stuff.
[01:34:48.017 --> 01:34:50.639]  The point is, you need to get this new film.
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.061]  It is extremely powerful.
[01:34:53.141 --> 01:34:54.021]  Riddles in stone.
[01:34:54.061 --> 01:34:56.103]  Available at infowarriors.com or by calling 888.
[01:34:57.902 --> 01:35:01.407]  Alright, going back to David Bay, then we're going to go to these loaded phone lines.
[01:35:15.898 --> 01:35:20.980]  David, again, just kind of in a thumbnail sketch, walk through why the elite do this.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.461]  They really believe there's going to be a world government leader.
[01:35:23.961 --> 01:35:25.441]  They're Christ.
[01:35:25.902 --> 01:35:27.822]  They're Masonic Christ.
[01:35:27.962 --> 01:35:28.903]  One world religion.
[01:35:28.943 --> 01:35:30.083]  They want to reduce our numbers.
[01:35:30.623 --> 01:35:36.105]  I'm making a film parallel to this right now that just gets into the actual politics of it.
[01:35:37.247 --> 01:35:38.849]  You know, instead of the history of it.
[01:35:39.609 --> 01:35:43.052]  But, I mean, break it down, because I want people tuning in to understand.
[01:35:43.873 --> 01:35:47.556]  You know, you're 14 years of research, and I've done the same amount of research.
[01:35:47.996 --> 01:35:51.219]  Unfortunately, it's horrifying that this is real.
[01:35:51.259 --> 01:35:54.322]  We're not telling you about... I mean, take Ghostbusters.
[01:35:54.362 --> 01:35:55.763]  I mentioned that, and then we ran into the break.
[01:35:56.283 --> 01:36:05.511]  In that movie, which of course is ridiculous, most of it, but it says there's a crazy architect in New York who built a building to channel spiritual energy.
[01:36:06.423 --> 01:36:09.405]  Well, the truth is, that's what they admit capitals are built for.
[01:36:10.426 --> 01:36:14.649]  The Frost Bank building downtown looks like the building out of Ghostbusters.
[01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:19.192]  There's weird crystal pyramids throughout the building and pyramids all over the place.
[01:36:19.572 --> 01:36:21.794]  I mean, they believe they get power from this.
[01:36:22.995 --> 01:36:23.495]  David Bay?
[01:36:24.596 --> 01:36:32.442]  Not only that, Alex, but they use our hard-earned tax dollars to build those things.
[01:36:33.282 --> 01:36:35.624]  But yes, the capital was made to
[01:36:36.534 --> 01:36:44.403]  What was made to reverberate with a very powerful occult energy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:36:45.304 --> 01:36:53.713]  And they felt that America would have to be this leader into this global system.
[01:36:54.181 --> 01:37:00.004]  For somewhat over 200 years, people with this system could come into play.
[01:37:00.164 --> 01:37:02.525]  They also build them on key meridian lines.
[01:37:02.965 --> 01:37:03.665]  Yes.
[01:37:03.705 --> 01:37:16.311]  Washington, D.C., as we show in Volume 1, the New Atlantis was on the southernmost city, built on a line with each other.
[01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:22.794]  It was Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, all built on a ley line.
[01:37:23.456 --> 01:37:35.666]  And as you extend that line out over the Atlantic, the line goes right smack-dab through the middle of Stonehenge, which is, you know, a tremendous pagan black magic symbol.
[01:37:36.086 --> 01:37:37.187]  But Washington, D.C.
[01:37:37.227 --> 01:37:51.859]  was not only the southernmost city on that ley line of the five cities, but she's also on a north-south meridian, on the 77th meridian, which is considered by a cult to be God's meridian.
[01:37:52.728 --> 01:37:55.329]  No, no, no.
[01:37:55.629 --> 01:37:57.169]  Elaborate on Atlanta.
[01:37:57.209 --> 01:37:58.410]  That's really key to them.
[01:38:00.230 --> 01:38:00.370]  What?
[01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:01.210]  Atlantis, you mean?
[01:38:01.671 --> 01:38:02.651]  No, Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:38:04.231 --> 01:38:11.253]  Well, Atlanta, Georgia was named after their mythical city, Atlanta.
[01:38:11.913 --> 01:38:18.975]  And it's a city that's just alive with all sorts of occultic goings-on.
[01:38:19.015 --> 01:38:20.656]  You know, it's amazing.
[01:38:22.114 --> 01:38:24.255]  Denver also is a major power site.
[01:38:24.495 --> 01:38:28.117]  Austin, San Francisco, why are those cities so important to them?
[01:38:29.597 --> 01:38:37.201]  They are all believed to be on an occult, sacred site.
[01:38:37.421 --> 01:38:38.782]  Not secret, but sacred site.
[01:38:39.302 --> 01:38:50.867]  Denver, for example, is, you know, the occultists believe that Denver is sitting right on, you know, openings in the ground that go into the inner earth.
[01:38:51.565 --> 01:38:55.793]  And cultures believe that there is such a thing as an inner earth.
[01:38:55.813 --> 01:38:58.578]  The inner earth that's been depicted in movies, they believe in that.
[01:39:06.063 --> 01:39:09.507]  It's amazing.
[01:39:09.787 --> 01:39:11.108]  They've got your tax dollars.
[01:39:11.128 --> 01:39:17.014]  They command our armies and our forces and all of our weapons.
[01:39:17.434 --> 01:39:19.596]  It's a force that is absolutely to be reckoned with.
[01:39:25.778 --> 01:39:31.700]  Earlier I was babbling, I didn't get to the story because I moved on to something else, but a couple of months ago, Russian TV was here.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:40.483]  And I was explaining that capitals themselves are heaps, you know, they're breast, that obelisks are of course the male sexual organ.
[01:39:41.743 --> 01:39:43.864]  That's 101 anthropology in college.
[01:39:43.884 --> 01:39:46.164]  It's not, you know, some secret occult studies.
[01:39:46.504 --> 01:39:48.105]  That's what those are fashioned after.
[01:39:48.465 --> 01:39:51.586]  But I explained to them that it was, you know, goddess Diana
[01:39:52.754 --> 01:40:01.393]  That was on top of the tower, on top of the Capitol building here in Austin with the Lone Star in her hand.
[01:40:02.609 --> 01:40:05.591]  And the Russians, you know, were rolling their eyes.
[01:40:06.131 --> 01:40:16.276]  We get into the building and they put up some display about the goddess of the building and how she helps the building and the history of the goddess and how it's a temple.
[01:40:16.837 --> 01:40:22.840]  And the Russians had their mouths, one particular Russian lady, had her mouth hanging open.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:26.322]  So, I mean, that was kind of fortuitous or a blessing that that happened.
[01:40:27.828 --> 01:40:31.772]  The goddess is prevalent in Washington, D.C.
[01:40:32.053 --> 01:40:46.048]  In fact, one author, who has now become a Freemason, David Oberson, has written a book about the Masonic secret architecture of Washington, and he says that all of Washington is about the goddess.
[01:40:46.656 --> 01:40:53.138]  Well, that's a half-truth, because what Washington is really about is the right-angled triangle.
[01:40:53.158 --> 01:40:53.878]  There's always both sides.
[01:40:54.018 --> 01:40:55.598]  There's always the male and the female.
[01:40:55.618 --> 01:40:57.839]  There's always the goddess and then the horned stag.
[01:40:58.279 --> 01:41:06.841]  But see, they picture, in the layout of Government Center, they have two right-angled triangles.
[01:41:07.262 --> 01:41:11.103]  The larger Lawn Fawn triangle and the smaller Federal triangle.
[01:41:11.623 --> 01:41:15.904]  And according to their reinterpretation of the Pythagoras right-angled triangle,
[01:41:16.704 --> 01:41:32.875]  The Divine Child, the Masonic Christ, is produced by a mystical reunion between the male, which is the upright part of the right triangle, and the female, the Goddess, which is the horizontal.
[01:41:35.176 --> 01:41:43.762]  They mystically unite sexually, and the Divine Child is formed, and he is pictured by the hypotenuse.
[01:41:44.639 --> 01:41:51.363]  So, Pennsylvania is the hypotenuse of both the Federal Triangle and the Law and Bond Triangle.
[01:41:52.004 --> 01:42:05.192]  And so, in the street design of Washington... And then, of course, you have the Oval Office, that is, the ovaries, and then you've got all the obelisks, it's all coming together there at the White House, and then down at the bottom of the pentagram, you've got the Capitol.
[01:42:07.011 --> 01:42:10.354]  Yeah, well, not the pentagram, but the right angle triangle, right.
[01:42:10.754 --> 01:42:14.036]  Yeah, the Capitol is at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:42:14.377 --> 01:42:18.660]  The White House is at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:19.621]  That's the hypotenuse.
[01:42:20.041 --> 01:42:21.522]  That is the Divine Child.
[01:42:22.103 --> 01:42:30.289]  And then, on the National Archives building, facing Pennsylvania Avenue, you know, Pennsylvania Avenue is the hypotenuse, which is the Divine Child.
[01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:32.451]  You've got the man, Destiny.
[01:42:33.619 --> 01:42:39.441]  Uh, uh, uh, depicted in the Tempanium, uh, at the very top of the Archives Building.
[01:42:39.861 --> 01:42:42.002]  And he is sitting on a throne of the world!
[01:42:42.382 --> 01:42:44.302]  And he is ruling the world!
[01:42:44.782 --> 01:42:49.704]  And above him are six stars, and of course, six is the number of a perfected man, to the occultist.
[01:42:50.342 --> 01:42:54.846]  So he is overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, which is the Hyde Park.
[01:42:54.926 --> 01:42:59.129]  And the Bible tells us, let he who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast.
[01:42:59.169 --> 01:43:00.550]  And they put it right out in front of us.
[01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:02.191]  They hang their sign right out.
[01:43:02.231 --> 01:43:03.392]  They hang their shingle out.
[01:43:04.053 --> 01:43:09.057]  Well, Adolf Hitler used to love to say that the best way to hide something is to put it out in the open.
[01:43:10.058 --> 01:43:11.519]  And that's exactly what they've done.
[01:43:11.759 --> 01:43:13.781]  They've counted on the fact that as Americans,
[01:43:15.349 --> 01:43:29.320]  That as America rolled through its history, got further and further away from the Great Awakening revival of the late 1700s, that the people would become less and less aware of occult symbols and occult beliefs.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:36.786]  Well, if you want to get into occult symbols, what about all the... I mean, once we get into this, we realize it's everywhere, though.
[01:43:37.146 --> 01:43:41.770]  Most of the churches have these male member steeples.
[01:43:43.254 --> 01:43:43.834]  Yeah, right.
[01:43:43.934 --> 01:43:44.715]  Well, yeah.
[01:43:44.875 --> 01:43:51.663]  Occultists claim that church steeples are disguised obelisks.
[01:43:52.163 --> 01:43:52.383]  Yes.
[01:43:53.164 --> 01:43:53.425]  Uh-huh.
[01:43:54.346 --> 01:44:02.955]  And of course, in many, many of your mainline churches, if you look in their graveyards, many of the graves are obelisks.
[01:44:04.349 --> 01:44:08.933]  I mean, it's been in American society since the very, very beginning.
[01:44:09.293 --> 01:44:13.056]  Now, we're not saying that every church has got a steeple, that your preacher is a devil worshipper.
[01:44:13.076 --> 01:44:13.617]  No, absolutely not.
[01:44:13.657 --> 01:44:15.538]  The point is, this stuff is just everywhere.
[01:44:15.799 --> 01:44:16.319]  It's everywhere.
[01:44:16.639 --> 01:44:16.799]  Yeah.
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:20.803]  And, you know, it's just permeating our society.
[01:44:22.544 --> 01:44:27.488]  What people need to understand is, and I go back to it, the foundation of America
[01:44:29.006 --> 01:44:33.347]  As far as the people's values are concerned, the cultural values, was based on Christian principles.
[01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:41.249]  But, the government itself was steeped in paganism, and it's the kind of paganism that the Bible foretells at the end of the age.
[01:44:42.049 --> 01:44:45.389]  And this is going to fulfill Bible prophecy when this is fully worked out.
[01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:49.510]  Now, from my research, about what, 60% of the Founding Fathers were Masons?
[01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:52.071]  Probably, yeah.
[01:44:52.131 --> 01:44:54.391]  Well, probably.
[01:44:54.471 --> 01:44:58.512]  Although, Manly P. Hall,
[01:44:59.042 --> 01:45:04.468]  Who is declared by masons to be the greatest modern mason ever.
[01:45:05.008 --> 01:45:11.756]  He said that 50 of the 55 signers of the Declaration of Independence were free masons.
[01:45:12.496 --> 01:45:15.179]  And we run into similar, you know, 50, 52, you know,
[01:45:19.248 --> 01:45:28.859]  But let's be clear though, a lot of them were porch masons, that is, they weren't at the highest levels worshipping the black dragon in the pit.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.661]  That's true, that's true.
[01:45:30.901 --> 01:45:31.622]  That is a fact.
[01:45:31.662 --> 01:45:35.526]  There are two types of Masonic lodges, the visible and the invisible.
[01:45:35.947 --> 01:45:40.272]  And the visible lodge is what is visible, of course, everybody sees it.
[01:45:40.752 --> 01:45:46.897]  And about 95% of all Masons at any one time are members of the Visible Lodge.
[01:45:47.198 --> 01:45:50.260]  And that's not even an outer gate to their real temples.
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.663]  That's only one outer gate that could lead to their real temples.
[01:45:53.903 --> 01:45:55.745]  They have many gates, many front groups.
[01:45:56.045 --> 01:45:58.087]  Yeah, it's a smoke and mirrors society.
[01:45:58.407 --> 01:46:04.993]  But Manly Hall says the purpose of the Visible Lodge is to hide the very existence of the invisible.
[01:46:05.515 --> 01:46:10.457]  And what we're talking about here are mostly our guys in the Invisible Lodge.
[01:46:10.637 --> 01:46:12.997]  I mean, the Invisible Lodge.
[01:46:13.037 --> 01:46:23.881]  And that lets the Invisible Lodge have false motives for mainline masons so they can also keep an eye in a secret brotherhood on many of the good and prominent men.
[01:46:23.901 --> 01:46:27.222]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:46:28.643 --> 01:46:32.204]  It's an organization that is not only smoking mirrors, but it is
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:40.686]  It's as deceptive as you can imagine, and the people in the Visible Lodge are lied to all their lives.
[01:46:41.226 --> 01:46:47.771]  Guys can be a 33rd degree mason, have been a mason for 40 years, and not realize that everything they've been taught is a lie.
[01:46:48.732 --> 01:47:01.342]  And, you know, Albert Pike said in his book, Morals and Dogma, it is not necessary for members, for Freemasons to actually learn the meaning of the symbols,
[01:47:01.784 --> 01:47:05.706]  It's only necessary that they think they know the meaning of the symbol.
[01:47:06.687 --> 01:47:08.247]  And so they lie to their own people.
[01:47:08.768 --> 01:47:17.252]  But that's, you know, that's Freemasonry, but that's the kind of society that founded our country and rules it today.
[01:47:18.473 --> 01:47:24.576]  We quote the House Resolution number 33, which was passed in January of this year.
[01:47:25.896 --> 01:47:30.719]  And it says that most of the founding fathers
[01:47:31.388 --> 01:47:32.469]  Were Masons.
[01:47:32.949 --> 01:47:37.232]  Now that, the House Resolution number 33, passed just this year.
[01:47:37.493 --> 01:47:39.954]  Now of course, 33 is a very important number to them.
[01:47:40.315 --> 01:47:45.118]  Oh yeah, it's the, you know, number 11 to them is the number of their Masonic Christ.
[01:47:45.839 --> 01:47:51.543]  And anything times 11 is considered also to be a number of their coming Christ.
[01:47:51.583 --> 01:47:53.925]  So, 22 and 33 are very important.
[01:47:53.945 --> 01:47:55.126]  33 also goes into Pi.
[01:47:56.106 --> 01:47:57.027]  Yes.
[01:47:57.067 --> 01:47:57.988]  Yeah, they just love it.
[01:47:58.642 --> 01:48:01.123]  Yeah, it all just seems to flow together, you know?
[01:48:02.303 --> 01:48:10.687]  But this film, Riddles and Stones, Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., shows the story that's being told in
[01:48:12.230 --> 01:48:14.052]  In Washington D.C.
[01:48:14.112 --> 01:48:16.235]  and how it all flows.
[01:48:18.978 --> 01:48:21.761]  The obelisk, which you mentioned, is the male shaft.
[01:48:21.922 --> 01:48:25.225]  To be exact, it's Bale's shaft.
[01:48:25.266 --> 01:48:26.487]  It's the devil's member.
[01:48:32.290 --> 01:48:32.890]  Right.
[01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:38.672]  Well, the bail is considered to be, you know, has become synonymous with the devil.
[01:48:39.052 --> 01:49:00.498]  But the corn, wine, and oil ceremony, which the Masons have, you know, used to dedicate, they dedicated the ground originally that the Capitol was built on, they built, they dedicated with corn, wine, and oil every single major building, you know, in the government center, all the way up through the
[01:49:02.265 --> 01:49:04.726]  The time of Franklin Roosevelt.
[01:49:04.766 --> 01:49:05.787]  Explain why they do that.
[01:49:06.627 --> 01:49:13.410]  Well, corn, wine, and oil, according to Hosea chapter 1, is a bail ceremony.
[01:49:13.851 --> 01:49:20.634]  And God said, you did not know that it was I who gave you the corn, wine, and oil, which you then prepared for bail.
[01:49:21.584 --> 01:49:32.621]  So it is veil worship, and it's interesting, we allow Freemasons apologists pretty good time on this video.
[01:49:32.661 --> 01:49:34.524]  We let them have their say.
[01:49:36.078 --> 01:49:40.540]  And occasionally, they came out with some unexpected gems.
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:44.382]  For example, Trevor McEwen... Stay there!
[01:49:44.462 --> 01:49:44.762]  Stay there!
[01:49:44.782 --> 01:49:46.844]  We're going to come back and talk to George in Arizona and others.
[01:49:47.204 --> 01:49:49.385]  Got this segment, one other left, and we're going to get to all your calls.
[01:49:49.425 --> 01:49:52.627]  Coming up in the third hour, also got a special guest joining us, a bunch of audio clips.
[01:49:56.994 --> 01:50:02.464]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.825 --> 01:50:10.418]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.147 --> 01:50:18.189]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:30.013]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.334 --> 01:50:34.235]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.275 --> 01:50:36.215]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.556 --> 01:50:40.397]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.522 --> 01:50:58.604]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.664 --> 01:51:05.967]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:06.127 --> 01:51:16.751]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.951 --> 01:51:21.493]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.793 --> 01:51:26.774]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.974 --> 01:51:29.915]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.135 --> 01:51:39.818]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:52:32.205 --> 01:52:32.625]  I think so.
[01:53:02.283 --> 01:53:29.132]  Imagine the leaders of almost every major nation striving for a one world government of total tyranny and oppression so they're
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:36.063]  Their leader, the one with destiny carved on his head, can be our ruler.
[01:53:36.103 --> 01:53:38.784]  I know he has special presence for all his servants.
[01:53:39.444 --> 01:53:40.124]  Don't worry.
[01:53:40.605 --> 01:53:42.145]  The churches will hail it as Jesus.
[01:53:43.286 --> 01:53:44.566]  People wonder how this could happen.
[01:53:44.606 --> 01:53:45.847]  They're already set up to do it.
[01:53:47.307 --> 01:53:57.452]  Meanwhile, 15 soldiers detained by Iranian Navy and our government, the British, sent a man to have confrontations in their waters to grab Iranian ships
[01:53:58.357 --> 01:54:03.019]  And the Israelis are saying that embassies in Tehran are preparing escape plans.
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:04.880]  So it looks like they're trying to start it.
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.722]  I mean, this could happen any time, but we're seeing all the tell-tale signs.
[01:54:08.102 --> 01:54:09.402]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:10.903 --> 01:54:11.783]  David Bay is our guest.
[01:54:11.803 --> 01:54:13.944]  We've got to get him up again in the near future.
[01:54:13.964 --> 01:54:14.665]  We're going to have his...
[01:54:15.749 --> 01:54:21.852]  The director who made the film up as well, Riddles in Stone, Secret Architecture in Washington, D.C.
[01:54:22.453 --> 01:54:24.774]  Such an important film available on Infowars.com.
[01:54:24.814 --> 01:54:25.454]  I hope you get it.
[01:54:25.734 --> 01:54:29.736]  Let's go to George in Arizona for David Bay.
[01:54:29.756 --> 01:54:30.717]  You're on the air, George.
[01:54:31.757 --> 01:54:32.898]  Hi Alex and David Bay.
[01:54:32.938 --> 01:54:33.958]  Thank you for letting me come on.
[01:54:34.259 --> 01:54:37.440]  I wanted to ask the question and then I'm going to read you the answer, okay?
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.642]  What is the connection between Freemasonry and the Rothschild Bank of England?
[01:54:41.764 --> 01:54:45.707]  And what I'm going to read is page 74, Mortals and Dogma, by Albert Pike.
[01:54:46.367 --> 01:54:46.647]  Okay?
[01:54:47.388 --> 01:54:51.570]  All truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Jewish Kabbalah and returned to it.
[01:54:52.771 --> 01:54:58.375]  All of the Masonic associations owe to the Jewish Kabbalah the secrets and their symbols.
[01:54:58.395 --> 01:55:02.518]  So all secrets and symbols of Freemasonry come out of the Jewish Kabbalah.
[01:55:02.978 --> 01:55:05.600]  Now let me read page 321, one or two sentences.
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.262]  This is the second most secret of the Freemasons.
[01:55:10.091 --> 01:55:11.493]  Lucifer, the Light Bearer.
[01:55:11.953 --> 01:55:16.538]  Strange and mysterious name to give to the spirit of darkness.
[01:55:16.919 --> 01:55:19.782]  Lucifer, the son of the Eastern Star.
[01:55:20.523 --> 01:55:28.732]  It is he who bears the light, and with its splendors, intolerably blinds feeble and selfish souls.
[01:55:29.253 --> 01:55:29.934]  Doubt it not.
[01:55:30.703 --> 01:55:35.806]  So, the tie-in is always, why is the Rothschild Bank of England a Freemasonry?
[01:55:36.347 --> 01:55:37.688]  And the answer is, it's the Walla.
[01:55:38.068 --> 01:55:39.149]  Sure, let me comment on that.
[01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:43.371]  Have you seen the new Israeli Supreme Court building?
[01:55:43.411 --> 01:55:44.392]  It's a giant, all-seeing eye.
[01:55:44.412 --> 01:55:44.952]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:45.133 --> 01:55:46.714]  DIP sent that to me, that's correct.
[01:55:46.774 --> 01:55:50.036]  With Thunderbolt shooting out of it, but let me...
[01:55:50.865 --> 01:55:53.749]  And again, I'm not defending Israel or defending the Kabbalah here.
[01:55:53.769 --> 01:55:55.511]  People take this out of context.
[01:55:56.032 --> 01:55:58.315]  I'm saying it all comes out of the same place.
[01:55:58.936 --> 01:56:03.562]  So for Pike to say it's all Jewish is really deceptive.
[01:56:03.662 --> 01:56:04.744]  It's the same thing.
[01:56:04.784 --> 01:56:06.546]  It's like if you have, again, three bank robbers.
[01:56:06.786 --> 01:56:07.968]  They're all three bank robbers.
[01:56:08.448 --> 01:56:12.392]  Okay, so I'm not defending, I'm saying that's bad and wicked, and we're exposing it.
[01:56:12.932 --> 01:56:14.914]  The point is, where did the Jews learn that?
[01:56:15.234 --> 01:56:17.876]  They learned that in Egypt, when they were in captivity.
[01:56:19.318 --> 01:56:20.439]  In Babylon.
[01:56:20.479 --> 01:56:29.767]  Well, I understand, but Egypt had its own construction mystery schools, then they went into captivity in Babylon, and then you got the Zohar, and all that later.
[01:56:29.807 --> 01:56:35.812]  But it didn't matter, the Babylonians, the Greeks, the Egyptians were all doing the same thing too.
[01:56:36.252 --> 01:56:38.152]  That's right.
[01:56:38.472 --> 01:56:43.153]  It's a combined Gentile-Jewish conspiracy.
[01:56:43.593 --> 01:56:52.255]  The fact that the Kabbalah formed the cornerstone for their belief is true, but it doesn't mean that this is all a Jewish conspiracy.
[01:56:52.715 --> 01:56:54.656]  It's a Gentile-Jewish conspiracy.
[01:56:54.896 --> 01:56:55.996]  I agree with what you're saying.
[01:56:56.296 --> 01:57:05.758]  It looks like God moved His people west and ended up here in the New World, but also God moved the bad guys west.
[01:57:06.468 --> 01:57:17.915]  Uh, you know, Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, and then they went to Greece, and then they went to Rome, and then they went to Paris, and then they went to, you know, London, and then they went to, uh, what's that called?
[01:57:17.935 --> 01:57:19.016]  The, uh... New York.
[01:57:19.316 --> 01:57:24.720]  New York City, but I can't, uh... What's the name of that hotel that's with the big, uh, uh, British, uh, spy base?
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:26.721]  Um... I can't think of it.
[01:57:26.861 --> 01:57:28.582]  Anyway, one of those guys went down with it.
[01:57:29.062 --> 01:57:29.883]  Stay there, caller.
[01:57:29.923 --> 01:57:31.004]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:57:33.749 --> 01:57:38.332]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.352 --> 01:57:38.872]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.052 --> 01:57:39.852]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.872 --> 01:57:42.974]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:44.035 --> 01:57:46.756]  You want answers?
[01:57:46.896 --> 01:57:48.997]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.055 --> 01:58:02.038]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.238 --> 01:58:06.361]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.162 --> 01:58:10.164]  Already into the third and final hour of this Friday edition.
[01:58:10.184 --> 01:58:11.765]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:11.805 --> 01:58:15.948]  Central Time, syndicated out of the News Radio 590K LBJ Studios.
[01:58:17.269 --> 01:58:18.890]  Matt, Louis, Bill, Jeff,
[01:58:23.268 --> 01:58:26.089]  We're going to get to all your calls.
[01:58:26.109 --> 01:58:29.971]  We've got a mini-guest coming up from 9-11 Truth Philly who shot down Alan Dershowitz.
[01:58:29.991 --> 01:58:30.792]  We promise to do that.
[01:58:30.872 --> 01:58:31.892]  It's coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:32.332 --> 01:58:33.453]  David Bay is our guest.
[01:58:33.473 --> 01:58:35.474]  The amazing film that he produced.
[01:58:35.494 --> 01:58:38.095]  We've got the director coming on next week.
[01:58:38.175 --> 01:58:39.616]  Riddles in Stone.
[01:58:40.176 --> 01:58:42.177]  Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[01:58:42.938 --> 01:58:45.599]  Amazing film available at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:46.665 --> 01:58:47.146]  Right now.
[01:58:48.106 --> 01:59:04.461]  George, finish up your point about the mystic Kabbalah, you know, stuff out of the Pharisees, and how that ties into all this, according to the Supreme Grand International Mason Head, Albert Pike, in Morals and Dogma, written in the 1870s.
[01:59:05.161 --> 01:59:14.029]  Okay, I'll just make one more point, because I don't want to hog the phone line, but today we should notice that virtually all of the Muslim Islamic leaders are 33rd degree Freemasons,
[01:59:14.733 --> 01:59:23.841]  Like Qaddafi, Mubarak from Egypt, and the others, you know, Hussein from Jordan.
[01:59:24.342 --> 01:59:31.388]  They're all Freemasons, and so that means they're controlled by the British Secret Intelligence Service, you know, which is controlled by the Rothschild Bank of England.
[01:59:31.408 --> 01:59:32.249]  So that's all I have.
[01:59:32.449 --> 01:59:33.890]  I'll just point that out, and I'll let Glenn go.
[01:59:34.210 --> 01:59:35.251]  Yeah, that's pretty accurate.
[01:59:35.271 --> 01:59:37.613]  David, go ahead.
[01:59:37.633 --> 01:59:39.175]  Yes, I mean, when we invaded
[01:59:42.239 --> 01:59:51.505]  You know, Iraq in 1991, in the Cold War I, the top mason in the world was King Hussein of Jordan.
[01:59:52.266 --> 01:59:57.229]  And so yeah, Freemasonry is always held.
[01:59:57.329 --> 02:00:11.478]  If you're going to stage a conflict that will move the world where you want it to go, and that's what the Illuminati does in their dialectic plan, you have to control both sides.
[02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:22.258]  And Freemasonry has always had a tremendous strong arm in the Islamic world, always.
[02:00:22.498 --> 02:00:27.601]  But again, to call it Freemasonry, that's only one arm or one tentacle, one head of the hydra.
[02:00:27.641 --> 02:00:31.164]  It's the same mystery school, just different names, different flavors.
[02:00:31.544 --> 02:00:32.185]  Right, right.
[02:00:32.405 --> 02:00:33.526]  And if you look at the Shriners,
[02:00:33.926 --> 02:00:39.310]  They are totally giving over to Islam.
[02:00:40.851 --> 02:00:52.879]  The Red Fez, the Hella Temple, with the Islamic sword, with the crescent moon, the Red Fez hat, it's all Islamic.
[02:00:54.841 --> 02:01:00.825]  In fact, the big problem... Well, Napoleon was a big nation and he joined Islam.
[02:01:02.847 --> 02:01:03.447]  Did you know that?
[02:01:03.768 --> 02:01:04.308]  No, I didn't.
[02:01:04.688 --> 02:01:04.928]  Yeah.
[02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.449]  I didn't.
[02:01:05.749 --> 02:01:26.062]  But, you see, the civil war that's threatening between Abbas's Fatah group and the Hamas-Palestinian group is over the fact that Abbas is a Freemason and trying to move the Palestinians where the Illuminati wants them, and Hamas is not a Freemason and wants nothing part of it.
[02:01:27.322 --> 02:01:28.303]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:01:28.543 --> 02:01:29.404]  Yeah, it's really amazing.
[02:01:32.119 --> 02:01:37.522]  Well, I want to know how Islam isn't allowed to have idols, but they've got the idols all in their temples.
[02:01:38.482 --> 02:01:44.205]  Well, it's another one of those instances where they say one thing and do another.
[02:01:44.225 --> 02:01:47.807]  You know, that's quite common in major religions.
[02:01:48.447 --> 02:01:50.768]  Too common in Christianity, I think.
[02:01:50.788 --> 02:01:50.888]  Yeah.
[02:01:50.908 --> 02:01:52.349]  David Batty, great job on this.
[02:01:52.369 --> 02:01:53.830]  Can't wait to interview your director.
[02:01:54.250 --> 02:01:55.590]  And we'll be talking to you very soon.
[02:01:55.610 --> 02:01:56.311]  And God bless you.
[02:01:56.371 --> 02:01:57.391]  Godspeed on your work.
[02:01:57.772 --> 02:01:58.372]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:59.153 --> 02:01:59.573]  Take care.
[02:01:59.593 --> 02:02:00.554]  There goes David Bay.
[02:02:00.574 --> 02:02:01.335]  We're carrying it.
[02:02:02.015 --> 02:02:04.777]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have it discounted out of the gates.
[02:02:04.857 --> 02:02:05.778]  Riddles in Stone.
[02:02:06.338 --> 02:02:12.342]  You can get $5 off on it when you get it with Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings.
[02:02:12.402 --> 02:02:13.823]  And you get a discount on that as well.
[02:02:14.304 --> 02:02:17.626]  Or you can save, what is it, 30 plus percent?
[02:02:18.627 --> 02:02:19.207]  Or more.
[02:02:19.467 --> 02:02:23.070]  I just came up with these specials today when we got the DVDs in.
[02:02:25.074 --> 02:02:25.714]  They're up there.
[02:02:26.235 --> 02:02:28.195]  There's three different discounts, three different specials.
[02:02:28.235 --> 02:02:32.037]  You can get it alone, or get it with Part One, or get it with Order of Death.
[02:02:32.157 --> 02:02:35.259]  That then comes free with Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:02:35.759 --> 02:02:38.660]  So really, that'd be like half off with that one, because that's a pre-film.
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:41.561]  Alright, InfoWars.com.
[02:02:41.661 --> 02:02:43.042]  Get it, get it out to everybody.
[02:02:43.542 --> 02:02:44.303]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:44.323 --> 02:02:44.703]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.852 --> 02:02:54.218]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.619 --> 02:03:02.227]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.941 --> 02:03:10.004]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.404 --> 02:03:21.809]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:25.591]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.091 --> 02:03:28.052]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.352 --> 02:03:32.134]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:48.457 --> 02:03:51.237]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.497 --> 02:03:55.658]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.078 --> 02:03:56.918]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.218 --> 02:04:01.799]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.279 --> 02:04:04.401]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.901 --> 02:04:05.802]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:04:06.203 --> 02:04:19.614]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.654 --> 02:04:26.720]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:04:45.123 --> 02:04:49.685]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:04:50.086 --> 02:04:53.027]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:04:53.347 --> 02:04:55.909]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:04:56.269 --> 02:05:05.353]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:05:05.653 --> 02:05:08.615]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:05:08.795 --> 02:05:09.375]  We're good to go.
[02:05:32.205 --> 02:05:40.068]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:05:40.248 --> 02:05:42.970]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:05:45.611 --> 02:05:51.633]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:52.234 --> 02:05:55.215]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.300 --> 02:05:59.900]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:00.481 --> 02:06:05.882]  We are now already into the third and final hour, eight minutes in.
[02:06:06.782 --> 02:06:08.002]  And boy, we got a lot to cover.
[02:06:08.782 --> 02:06:11.423]  UK, 15 soldiers detained by Iranian Navy.
[02:06:11.983 --> 02:06:14.544]  Israel's talking about war could kick off any minute.
[02:06:14.904 --> 02:06:16.704]  This is the type of provocation we said.
[02:06:16.764 --> 02:06:20.605]  Have some soldiers captured, have one of their patrol boats fired on by having
[02:06:21.397 --> 02:06:21.818]  We're good to go.
[02:06:37.731 --> 02:06:51.403]  Until they got captured, and so they've kidnapped our people, but it was in the news that they've been captured several miles into Lebanon, and then Israel starts bombing, and then Lebanon starts shooting Katyusha rockets, and then the news announces, they're firing Katyushas for no reason!
[02:06:53.584 --> 02:07:04.814]  It's just so mindless, but that's how they operate, and they want to start this war, so we'll get into that after we talk to this guest, and before we cover the Iranians, I'll get to Matt and Gary, and
[02:07:06.827 --> 02:07:08.968]  I've got so many calls here, I can't keep track of them anymore.
[02:07:10.188 --> 02:07:16.190]  Actually, we'll go to Kyle in the Czech Republic, Jeff, Bill, Lewis, Matt, but Lewis and Matt are first.
[02:07:16.890 --> 02:07:21.931]  But right now, let's go to Nick Lasko, Philly 9-11 Truth.
[02:07:22.532 --> 02:07:26.853]  They confronted Alan Dershowitz a few days ago, and we played this yesterday.
[02:07:27.774 --> 02:07:29.055]  And they did an excellent job.
[02:07:29.135 --> 02:07:30.837]  Headline from PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:07:30.857 --> 02:07:34.741]  9-11 Truthers confront Alan Mingula Dershowitz.
[02:07:35.402 --> 02:07:37.003]  This is the guy that says torture is good.
[02:07:37.043 --> 02:07:39.666]  He's their brainwashing group of Christians and Jews.
[02:07:40.712 --> 02:07:48.655]  About how they need to be Kool-Aid drinkers, and world government's wonderful, and global fight on terrorism's wonderful, and we've got to get ready for the next war.
[02:07:48.955 --> 02:07:51.015]  And they're having these meetings everywhere, getting everybody ready.
[02:07:51.495 --> 02:07:58.818]  But we're going to play part of the clip again, but to get it directly from the folks at Philadelphia 9-11 Truth, here is Nick Lasko.
[02:07:59.138 --> 02:08:03.159]  And Nick, I'm told you're related to Meg's over at Popular Mechanics.
[02:08:03.639 --> 02:08:08.781]  It's pretty embarrassing, but basically me and
[02:08:09.501 --> 02:08:23.926]  My uncle Jim Meigs, we basically agree that we both really strongly disagree on how he handled 9-11, how he handled his piece on it, and especially just how he called
[02:08:24.648 --> 02:08:29.874]  Jason and Dylan Holocaust Deniers when, if anything, it would be the exact opposite?
[02:08:30.295 --> 02:08:31.476]  Well, that's all they do, though.
[02:08:31.496 --> 02:08:33.138]  I mean, did you just hear the O'Reilly Factor?
[02:08:33.658 --> 02:08:38.103]  Where I said four times, actually five times, they said Nazis, Holocaust Deniers.
[02:08:38.164 --> 02:08:40.146]  I mean, this is just... It isn't gonna work.
[02:08:40.286 --> 02:08:41.948]  I mean, that's slander, number one.
[02:08:43.325 --> 02:08:44.326]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:08:44.366 --> 02:08:59.602]  And when you hear, these days, when you hear someone just being called a Holocaust denier, I always just really bet whoever that is, and you know, nine times out of ten, it turns out it's someone who's talking about the New World Order or false flag terrorism or something totally controversial.
[02:08:59.622 --> 02:09:01.885]  You're saying global warming isn't man-made?
[02:09:01.905 --> 02:09:03.967]  You're now called a Nazi, a Holocaust denier.
[02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:14.722]  I mean, if you complain to the dog catcher that your dog was running around the front yard and he took him, will they come arrest you and say you're one to kill Jews?
[02:09:15.463 --> 02:09:15.783]  I know.
[02:09:16.544 --> 02:09:21.210]  I mean, pretty soon if you go complain about your property tax, they'll say, my gosh, you're a Jew-hater.
[02:09:22.211 --> 02:09:24.174]  And I'm serious, this is starting to get ridiculous.
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:31.023]  I mean, it just shows how desperately they're clinging on to the ridiculous official story regarding 9-11.
[02:09:31.043 --> 02:09:36.146]  Well, they're saying if you're against the Iraq War, you want to aid people that were like Hitler.
[02:09:37.226 --> 02:09:45.451]  And then you find out that Bush's grandfather actually funded Hitler, so... I mean, if anything, they're the Nazis.
[02:09:45.511 --> 02:09:50.193]  Well, not just funded, they were the head of the bank, the secret Nazi bank.
[02:09:51.329 --> 02:09:53.631]  It's amazing from every angle.
[02:09:54.431 --> 02:10:00.315]  It's like Arnold gets ADL awards because he says he admires Hitler and wants to be like Hitler someday.
[02:10:00.355 --> 02:10:01.716]  That's on record mainstream news.
[02:10:01.956 --> 02:10:05.359]  And that's good, but if you fight Hitler, the ADL says you're bad.
[02:10:06.059 --> 02:10:06.580]  Exactly.
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:10.803]  And then he appraises Kurt Waldheim and says he's a great guy.
[02:10:11.624 --> 02:10:15.808]  You know, no Nazi war criminal, but I guess that's the way it is.
[02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:16.649]  I don't know.
[02:10:16.729 --> 02:10:25.798]  Now tell us about when this was, what happened, exactly what they did do to you, what they did do to you, if that's English, I mean, what we couldn't get from just the video.
[02:10:26.764 --> 02:10:28.885]  Well, let me just preface this real quick.
[02:10:29.125 --> 02:10:40.230]  One of my compatriots saw the Dershowitz talk, speech, speaking engagement being advertised on I-95 on a billboard which said, Global Terrorism, the New World War.
[02:10:40.290 --> 02:10:45.392]  And it depicted the towers smoking and one of the planes flying into them and whatnot.
[02:10:45.432 --> 02:10:47.933]  So we went there and we thought it was going to be talking about 9-11.
[02:10:48.906 --> 02:10:49.226]  I'm good.
[02:11:07.559 --> 02:11:12.201]  And on and on and on, just pontificating about this whole, about terrorism and whatnot.
[02:11:12.441 --> 02:11:13.801]  WMDs everywhere!
[02:11:13.902 --> 02:11:15.402]  Cats and dogs living together!
[02:11:15.562 --> 02:11:16.322]  Armageddon!
[02:11:16.542 --> 02:11:17.523]  Worship government!
[02:11:17.563 --> 02:11:18.983]  Attack them or you're dead!
[02:11:20.464 --> 02:11:20.944]  Exactly.
[02:11:20.984 --> 02:11:31.288]  And so, basically I, at the end they had a Q&A and luckily I ran up and became third in line and I, you know, I said,
[02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:43.972]  Looking at all the previous examples of government-sponsored terrorism, of false flag operations like the Reichstag and the Gulf of Tonkin, you know, 9-11 really resembles a false flag operation from, you know, every angle.
[02:11:44.052 --> 02:11:45.313]  And then what else did you say?
[02:11:45.353 --> 02:11:51.634]  Because of the they-live, body-snatcher hissing, we couldn't hear a word of what you said.
[02:11:51.654 --> 02:11:57.255]  Well, as soon as I started to say, well, allow me to enumerate some evidence,
[02:11:57.854 --> 02:11:58.094]  I don't
[02:12:21.059 --> 02:12:31.850]  Well, you have this one old guy down in the front who, if you see in the lower right corner, he gets up and just like an umpire throwing out an angry coach at a baseball game.
[02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:33.291]  He's just like, get out of here!
[02:12:33.331 --> 02:12:34.072]  Get out of here!
[02:12:34.092 --> 02:12:36.574]  It was just, it was ridiculous.
[02:12:36.674 --> 02:12:39.898]  Me thinks you protest too much.
[02:12:41.559 --> 02:12:44.282]  And the thing was, I think there were a little bit of,
[02:12:44.795 --> 02:12:50.497]  You know, I'm comfortable with the fact that someone exercised their free speech right, and... Well, I mean, let's be clear.
[02:12:50.557 --> 02:13:06.623]  You probably talked 30 seconds for it, or 20, before they started screaming and freaking out, and they could have just said, okay, you're a kook, get out of here, and they were slick, but instead, they know, deep down, this is some serious, you know, high-powered hoodoo, and so they are upset.
[02:13:07.279 --> 02:13:08.981]  Oh yeah, they were really freaking out.
[02:13:09.021 --> 02:13:13.365]  And you'll hear Malcolm Holmline, the other speaker, both him and Dershowitz were up there.
[02:13:13.805 --> 02:13:15.326]  He said, don't worry, just sit down.
[02:13:15.527 --> 02:13:17.909]  We'll take your question after a few other questions.
[02:13:17.949 --> 02:13:18.770]  I was thinking, what?
[02:13:19.210 --> 02:13:21.272]  You answer everyone else's questions directly.
[02:13:21.292 --> 02:13:25.196]  I was like, no, I'm just going to stand up there and keep the man if they ask it.
[02:13:25.216 --> 02:13:27.057]  I'll just answer the question.
[02:13:27.077 --> 02:13:29.339]  And then finally, Dershowitz gives
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:34.882]  You know, since how he knows two or three people on the 9-11 Commission who are students.
[02:13:34.922 --> 02:13:35.503]  He taught them!
[02:13:35.543 --> 02:13:36.503]  They're his students!
[02:13:37.023 --> 02:13:39.024]  All these old men are his students.
[02:13:40.265 --> 02:13:42.266]  And of course, appointed by Bush.
[02:13:42.326 --> 02:13:45.348]  It's such an independent commission that it was appointed by Bush.
[02:13:45.868 --> 02:13:48.729]  And he first wanted to have Henry Kissinger, who it turns out has been running everything.
[02:13:49.029 --> 02:13:50.590]  Let's just play a minute or two of this.
[02:13:51.230 --> 02:13:51.651]  Here it is.
[02:13:51.691 --> 02:13:56.053]  I mean, you would have thought he would have bashed this toddler's brains out the way they behave.
[02:13:56.073 --> 02:13:56.353]  Here it is.
[02:13:57.108 --> 02:14:20.837]  Looking back at history, looking at such catalyzed events as the Reichstag fire and the Belt and Tonkin incident, both having emerged as classic false flag operations, never happened, were entirely carried out by no respective governments or elements within.
[02:14:21.597 --> 02:14:23.038]  I'm looking at 9-11.
[02:14:23.458 --> 02:14:31.003]  It really emerges as another classic false flag operation where elements within the government actually carry out the attack.
[02:14:31.023 --> 02:14:34.745]  I mean, just look at the evidence.
[02:14:35.325 --> 02:14:41.328]  The head of the Visa Bureau... This is the head of the Visa Bureau in Genesis.
[02:14:41.368 --> 02:14:46.231]  The court signed and invited the CIA, a bunch of the hijackers... Get out!
[02:14:46.271 --> 02:14:47.072]  Get out!
[02:14:53.294 --> 02:14:57.455]  Go on YouTube and watch how he do's it.
[02:14:57.775 --> 02:15:09.019]  Now they start screaming and yelling more.
[02:15:09.039 --> 02:15:11.239]  Yeah, that's their big intellectual.
[02:15:11.259 --> 02:15:12.940]  He brings up the head of the
[02:15:14.170 --> 02:15:17.773]  One of the major embassies is told to let them in.
[02:15:17.813 --> 02:15:19.194]  He says, but their flag is terrorist.
[02:15:19.214 --> 02:15:21.857]  They say, no, here's a designation for anti-terror training.
[02:15:22.177 --> 02:15:23.158]  They're government operatives.
[02:15:23.478 --> 02:15:25.380]  That's incredible bombshell information.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:28.923]  It was in Canadian papers, in German and British and other papers.
[02:15:29.123 --> 02:15:29.924]  Not in our papers.
[02:15:30.224 --> 02:15:31.445]  I've interviewed him several times.
[02:15:31.905 --> 02:15:33.306]  Other embassies said the same thing.
[02:15:33.587 --> 02:15:37.030]  We got colonels, the heads of bases, going public saying they were government agents.
[02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:39.572]  That's Associated Press, but again,
[02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:43.735]  You go see Howdy Doody on your YouTube-y!
[02:15:44.315 --> 02:15:45.997]  You little dum-dum!
[02:15:46.437 --> 02:15:52.021]  Well, and then you stood right back up to him and you said, no, government-sponsored terror is part of history.
[02:15:52.482 --> 02:15:53.763]  I tell you what, you did a great job.
[02:15:53.983 --> 02:15:54.783]  Now, what else happened?
[02:15:54.843 --> 02:15:56.204]  I mean, did you make it out of there?
[02:15:56.225 --> 02:15:57.525]  Did the cops escort you out?
[02:15:57.766 --> 02:16:00.067]  Were they hissing or like body snatchers?
[02:16:00.087 --> 02:16:04.571]  Was there any... You know how they do in the body snatcher movie where they point at you and then hiss?
[02:16:04.911 --> 02:16:05.792]  I mean, what was happening?
[02:16:06.627 --> 02:16:14.951]  Well, they just kept trying to shout me down, and if you watch the clip, after a while, one of the guys running the event says, oh, we're calling security.
[02:16:14.971 --> 02:16:16.772]  We're calling security right now.
[02:16:16.852 --> 02:16:18.313]  And I just kept on talking about it.
[02:16:18.333 --> 02:16:20.154]  He was the guy right up on the right side of me.
[02:16:20.194 --> 02:16:20.954]  I kept on saying, well, what?
[02:16:21.334 --> 02:16:22.295]  Oh, they said the police, too.
[02:16:23.387 --> 02:16:24.848]  I felt like, well, what are they going to arrest me with?
[02:16:24.868 --> 02:16:26.149]  He's like, I'm not going to tell you now.
[02:16:26.169 --> 02:16:27.130]  You just have to leave.
[02:16:27.250 --> 02:16:28.091]  Please leave.
[02:16:28.972 --> 02:16:30.233]  It was ridiculous.
[02:16:30.253 --> 02:16:32.415]  Just please let us bring America down.
[02:16:32.835 --> 02:16:34.276]  Just please let us have a police state.
[02:16:34.296 --> 02:16:34.997]  We are slaves.
[02:16:35.197 --> 02:16:35.958]  Don't struggle.
[02:16:35.978 --> 02:16:37.039]  Just submit to us.
[02:16:37.059 --> 02:16:39.481]  9-11 is for your own good.
[02:16:39.941 --> 02:16:40.321]  Just shut up.
[02:16:45.109 --> 02:16:51.871]  And so, you know, after about five minutes or so, they just moved on to the next guy.
[02:16:52.011 --> 02:16:54.812]  They both gave their ridiculous explanations.
[02:16:55.332 --> 02:17:00.014]  Oh yeah, Dershowitz said there was overwhelming evidence that Bin Laden was behind it.
[02:17:00.054 --> 02:17:01.494]  At that point, I was so disgusted.
[02:17:01.554 --> 02:17:04.095]  I was just like, the FBI said no hard evidence.
[02:17:05.271 --> 02:17:07.773]  It's a total, complete double thank you.
[02:17:22.526 --> 02:17:22.886]  Amen!
[02:17:23.247 --> 02:17:23.707]  Amen!
[02:17:24.028 --> 02:17:24.608]  Amen!
[02:17:24.889 --> 02:17:25.489]  Amen!
[02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:26.390]  Amen!
[02:17:26.651 --> 02:17:27.191]  Amen!
[02:17:27.291 --> 02:17:33.258]  All these fake Christians who couldn't go to Israel and preach a word without being thrown in prison.
[02:17:33.618 --> 02:17:34.159]  Amen!
[02:17:34.519 --> 02:17:35.160]  Amen!
[02:17:35.461 --> 02:17:36.141]  Amen!
[02:17:36.402 --> 02:17:37.142]  Amen!
[02:17:37.443 --> 02:17:38.124]  Amen!
[02:17:38.404 --> 02:17:39.004]  Amen!
[02:17:39.025 --> 02:17:41.607]  I love you!

[02:18:33.426 --> 02:18:35.727]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:35.847 --> 02:18:40.550]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:40.570 --> 02:18:42.751]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:44.592 --> 02:18:46.773]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:01.733 --> 02:19:06.337]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:07.257 --> 02:19:14.523]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[02:19:44.252 --> 02:19:49.035]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[02:19:49.255 --> 02:19:53.238]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.

[02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:47.710]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:50.692]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:20:51.072 --> 02:20:53.834]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[02:21:44.685 --> 02:22:01.182]  Barbara Walters' hand-picked co-host, Rosie O'Donnell, is now suggesting the United States government was responsible for the September 11th attacks and willingly killed 3,000 Americans at the Twin Towers to protect George W. Bush's friends at Enron.
[02:22:01.722 --> 02:22:08.429]  The ABC host said this, quote, Firefighters withdrawing from the area stated that the building was going to blow up.
[02:22:09.269 --> 02:22:19.051]  WTC7 contained offices of the FBI, Department of Defense, and IRS, which contained prodigious amounts of corporate tax fraud, including inlines.
[02:22:19.772 --> 02:22:29.554]  And on TV, Barbara Walters has allowed Rosie's radical rants to be broadcast front and center on Barbara's ABC show at the expense of herself and others.
[02:22:29.594 --> 02:22:30.314]  Wait a minute, Elizabeth.
[02:22:30.334 --> 02:22:31.074]  You have to stop.
[02:22:31.094 --> 02:22:31.794]  You have to stop.
[02:22:31.814 --> 02:22:34.655]  You can ask a question, but you can't just blather on your opinion.
[02:22:37.316 --> 02:22:39.418]  And who defends Rosie's radical rants?
[02:22:39.498 --> 02:22:42.200]  Well, veteran journalist Barbara Walters.
[02:22:42.381 --> 02:22:42.901]  Take a look.
[02:22:44.462 --> 02:22:47.145]  Rosie's opinions are... I'm gonna say this every day!
[02:22:47.165 --> 02:22:49.567]  Rosie's opinions are rants, right?
[02:22:50.723 --> 02:22:55.747]  But are Rosie's unhinged ravings causing the sad demise of a once great journalist?
[02:22:55.767 --> 02:22:59.049]  Here now is Matthew Felling, Media Director for the Center for Media and Public Affairs.
[02:22:59.489 --> 02:23:00.950]  Also with us, Steve Adubato.
[02:23:00.970 --> 02:23:01.430]  Right there.
[02:23:01.911 --> 02:23:03.092]  That's a ten minute clip.
[02:23:03.532 --> 02:23:05.773]  We've got Hannity and Combs.
[02:23:06.354 --> 02:23:08.475]  We've got Glenn Beck.
[02:23:09.016 --> 02:23:12.258]  We've got, I mean this thing went Nova, Nova, Nova, Supernova.
[02:23:13.272 --> 02:23:14.692]  And it's just exploding.
[02:23:14.832 --> 02:23:20.533]  Now we told you, Monday, we're going to push O'Donnell over the edge, we're going to push it out there, and I am in contact.
[02:23:21.014 --> 02:23:23.194]  And we're going to push the Charlie Sheen thing over the edge.
[02:23:24.054 --> 02:23:37.857]  Now, I didn't like the loose change thing blowing up, but it looks like that triggered this, so for whoever blabbermouthed, good job, because I just hope it doesn't derail the film, but look, we've got to expose these terrorists, and
[02:23:39.784 --> 02:23:42.186]  We need everybody to contact Scarborough Country.
[02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:45.408]  I've never done this because they'll never have me on.
[02:23:45.428 --> 02:23:52.292]  I've been contacted many times by all these shows and cancelled because they know that I'm very aggressive and I cover my points and ignore them.
[02:23:52.892 --> 02:23:54.233]  I don't get sucked into their games.
[02:23:54.693 --> 02:23:58.135]  It's not a very complex strategy, but it works.
[02:23:58.936 --> 02:23:59.436]  It's simple.
[02:23:59.536 --> 02:23:59.916]  Attack.
[02:24:00.137 --> 02:24:01.157]  Ignore their propaganda.
[02:24:01.978 --> 02:24:03.639]  And call Scarborough.
[02:24:03.699 --> 02:24:04.339]  Call Fox.
[02:24:04.419 --> 02:24:05.140]  Call everybody.
[02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:08.842]  They admitted you got Ron Paul on Fox the other day because hundreds of you called.
[02:24:09.705 --> 02:24:10.046]  Tell them.
[02:24:10.567 --> 02:24:13.712]  I'll go on and I'll debate them about this.
[02:24:13.912 --> 02:24:15.074]  I'll discuss these issues.
[02:24:16.135 --> 02:24:21.344]  By the way, they're doing straw men of three big posts she did with dozens of links each post.
[02:24:22.828 --> 02:24:26.031]  She made one comment about, oh, isn't it interesting that the Enron records were there.
[02:24:26.072 --> 02:24:36.522]  See, now they're saying, this is the script, that it's anti-Semitic, never talked about Jews, but, and that they're claiming it was all for Enron, because everybody knows that kind of sounds dumb, do all that for Enron.
[02:24:36.823 --> 02:24:40.647]  No, it was an added bonus, they picked a spot to cover a lot of bases.
[02:24:42.014 --> 02:24:50.146]  And we're going to come back, cover some other important war news, get into some other things, but I just want to thank Nick Lasko for coming on 9-11 Truth in Philly.
[02:24:50.566 --> 02:24:52.008]  Any websites for you guys?
[02:24:52.028 --> 02:24:54.752]  You did a great job with the YouTube video and it's good to have you on the team.
[02:24:59.662 --> 02:25:04.164]  Truth.org and then PA911visibility.com.
[02:25:04.184 --> 02:25:12.108]  And then if you're a college or high school graduate, go to Temple911Truth Facebook group and Global Vanguard Against False Flag Terrorism Facebook group.
[02:25:12.488 --> 02:25:16.810]  And check out John Gold's blog on 9-1-1 Blogger and the Truth Squad blog.
[02:25:16.930 --> 02:25:23.213]  And yeah, we're also going to be releasing some very, very interesting exposé.
[02:25:23.253 --> 02:25:26.355]  I can't really say too much about it, but it'll be up soon.
[02:25:27.250 --> 02:25:29.873]  And I think everyone will want to check it out.
[02:25:30.614 --> 02:25:33.998]  Will you lavish us with that exclusive?
[02:25:34.038 --> 02:25:35.840]  Will you call my producer when you're ready to launch that?
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:36.861]  Oh, of course!
[02:25:37.962 --> 02:25:39.624]  What does it have to do with?
[02:25:40.542 --> 02:25:42.043]  Um, kind of.
[02:25:42.083 --> 02:25:45.506]  You know, I really, it's kind of still sensitive at this point.
[02:25:45.526 --> 02:25:46.586]  Come on, it's just you and me.
[02:25:46.646 --> 02:25:46.967]  Tell me.
[02:25:48.188 --> 02:25:52.431]  It kind of had to do a little bit with COINTELPRO.
[02:25:52.811 --> 02:25:54.312]  I can't really say any more than that.
[02:25:54.612 --> 02:25:56.754]  Oh, you mean you've red-handed caught infiltrators?
[02:25:57.534 --> 02:25:59.836]  It's pretty, it's pretty suspect.
[02:25:59.896 --> 02:26:02.498]  It's pretty suspect and it'll damage the
[02:26:03.218 --> 02:26:05.079]  It'll do a lot of damage to the opposition out there.
[02:26:05.099 --> 02:26:06.139]  Well, here's the problem, though.
[02:26:06.159 --> 02:26:09.220]  Unless you've got them red-handed, that's how COINTELPRO works.
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:13.762]  When you respond to them, it only gives them more energy and gives oxygen to the flame.
[02:26:15.303 --> 02:26:15.743]  Well, yeah.
[02:26:15.823 --> 02:26:25.746]  I mean, but with this... Well, that may be the case, but it'll just show people... I just think it's really important to expose the whole COINTELPRO operation in general.
[02:26:26.046 --> 02:26:29.868]  Well, I think it's always good to expose things, but I know exactly who operatives are.
[02:26:30.735 --> 02:26:31.316]  I don't know.
[02:26:31.336 --> 02:26:31.656]  I don't know.
[02:26:55.626 --> 02:26:56.306]  Just let me see it.
[02:26:56.807 --> 02:26:57.447]  Do what you want.
[02:26:57.547 --> 02:26:58.028]  I mean, you know.
[02:26:58.488 --> 02:26:59.749]  Oh yeah, I'll run it by you.
[02:26:59.769 --> 02:27:01.410]  No, you don't have to run it by me.
[02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:03.591]  I thought it was something to do with 9-11 or something.
[02:27:04.071 --> 02:27:08.534]  I mean, if it's just, you know, some kook out causing problems... Well, we'll see what happens.
[02:27:08.574 --> 02:27:09.254]  Good to talk to you.
[02:27:09.274 --> 02:27:10.015]  Appreciate you coming on.
[02:27:10.435 --> 02:27:11.316]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:27:11.596 --> 02:27:11.856]  You bet.
[02:27:11.876 --> 02:27:12.596]  Good to hear from you.
[02:27:13.117 --> 02:27:15.918]  Okay, I know we've had crawlers holding and time immemorial.
[02:27:16.439 --> 02:27:20.101]  And we will zap through those as quickly as possible.
[02:27:20.121 --> 02:27:21.782]  Get into the escalation.
[02:27:22.262 --> 02:27:23.243]  They're in the...
[02:27:24.538 --> 02:27:25.078]  Gulf.
[02:27:25.118 --> 02:27:26.319]  The Persian Gulf.
[02:27:26.399 --> 02:27:27.359]  There with the Persians.
[02:27:27.599 --> 02:27:29.179]  You know them as the Iranians.
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:30.780]  Or I-Rabs.
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:33.201]  I don't like them I-Rabs.
[02:27:34.821 --> 02:27:35.741]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.201 --> 02:27:37.822]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.742 --> 02:27:41.423]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.001 --> 02:27:45.402]  Attention!
[02:27:45.522 --> 02:27:48.326]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.

[02:27:53.254 --> 02:27:53.935]  Listen closely.
[02:27:54.596 --> 02:28:00.005]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product considered to be the single most
[02:28:00.245 --> 02:28:00.706]  We're good to go.
[02:28:17.208 --> 02:28:26.677]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[02:28:26.877 --> 02:28:32.502]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.

[02:28:44.438 --> 02:28:53.086]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[02:28:53.867 --> 02:28:58.812]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[02:28:59.572 --> 02:29:05.541]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[02:29:06.262 --> 02:29:14.694]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their One World Government.
[02:29:15.447 --> 02:29:23.071]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[02:29:45.379 --> 02:29:49.522]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:29:49.742 --> 02:29:51.503]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:29:51.763 --> 02:29:58.047]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:29:58.348 --> 02:30:04.472]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:04.712 --> 02:30:06.573]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:30:06.813 --> 02:30:07.234]  I think so.
[02:30:21.630 --> 02:30:25.113]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.

[02:30:27.975 --> 02:30:29.056]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:29.316 --> 02:30:30.357]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:30:30.497 --> 02:30:33.159]  For more information call BioSolutions toll-free 1-866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.179 --> 02:30:33.399]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.419 --> 02:30:33.479]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:30:50.609 --> 02:30:53.191]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:30:53.231 --> 02:30:55.552]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:30:55.632 --> 02:30:58.594]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:30:58.654 --> 02:31:02.376]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[02:31:04.037 --> 02:31:06.018]  Big John!
[02:31:06.818 --> 02:31:09.120]  Big John!
[02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:11.401]  Big Mad John!
[02:31:12.542 --> 02:31:13.582]  Big John!
[02:31:15.692 --> 02:31:18.334]  Nobody saw John called home.
[02:31:18.374 --> 02:31:21.035]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[02:31:21.055 --> 02:31:22.656]  Didn't say much.
[02:31:22.716 --> 02:31:23.456]  I got so much here.
[02:31:23.476 --> 02:31:24.897]  This is insane to try to cover all this.
[02:31:24.937 --> 02:31:25.938]  I said I'd get to your calls.
[02:31:25.958 --> 02:31:28.779]  Let's do it quickly because I want to give each of you a chance.
[02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:31.781]  Let's talk to Kyle in the Czech Republic.
[02:31:32.201 --> 02:31:32.942]  Welcome, Kyle.
[02:31:32.962 --> 02:31:33.602]  You're on the air.
[02:31:34.442 --> 02:31:34.883]  Hey, Alex.
[02:31:34.923 --> 02:31:35.383]  How are you?
[02:31:35.643 --> 02:31:35.763]  Good.
[02:31:35.783 --> 02:31:37.884]  What are you doing over in the Czech Republic?
[02:31:39.285 --> 02:31:41.166]  My family's actually from this country.
[02:31:41.226 --> 02:31:43.848]  We're some Czechs, I guess you could call us.
[02:31:44.844 --> 02:31:47.686]  We immigrated over to Texas, um, during the 60s.
[02:31:47.966 --> 02:31:48.547]  Oh, cool!
[02:31:48.607 --> 02:31:48.907]  Cool!
[02:31:49.467 --> 02:31:49.828]  Yeah.
[02:31:50.548 --> 02:32:11.964]  And I'm actually a landowner in Texas, and it looks like the North American Union, which anniversary is today, is going to take that land, but... Well, I guess, uh... So, I'm... I don't know what to do about it, but... But anyway, what I wanted to call you about was, is that I wanted to tell you that when I left the States back in September, I actually lived in Ukraine for a long time and couldn't call in.
[02:32:11.984 --> 02:32:13.105]  What I wanted to call you about
[02:32:13.772 --> 02:32:24.335]  Was that, um, as I was boarding the plane, this was during the liquid bomber plot thing that was going on, and a Homeland Security agent, he stopped me, and he said, sir, may I see your document?
[02:32:24.415 --> 02:32:37.339]  And he only has a country that this has happened to me, and it was in Russia, and so I gave him my passport because I wanted to get out, and so, uh, he looked at my passport and he said, Mr. Brim, why are you leaving us here in the United States?
[02:32:38.479 --> 02:32:42.340]  And, and, and I was like, oh my God, am I seriously being asked this question?
[02:32:43.306 --> 02:32:49.967]  And I told him tourism, and he asked it again, and I said tourism, and then he let me board the plane, so I just wanted to tell you that.
[02:32:50.488 --> 02:32:51.488]  Well, it's part of freedom.
[02:32:52.368 --> 02:32:56.569]  Now, you can come into the country easy, but leaving's hard.
[02:32:56.949 --> 02:32:58.629]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[02:33:00.049 --> 02:33:03.150]  You don't have to have ID cards to get bank accounts, but you do.
[02:33:03.370 --> 02:33:10.272]  The only other country that that's happened to me in is Russia, so... Land of the coward, home of the slaves.
[02:33:10.292 --> 02:33:11.952]  It's really sad to see it happen all at once.
[02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:18.931]  Listen, the guys running this country want to have you to live under total jack buddhism.
[02:33:19.531 --> 02:33:21.552]  And they think they're going to get away with it, my friend, they're not.
[02:33:21.612 --> 02:33:26.533]  But I heard a lot of folks are waking up to the new world order over in the Czech Republic, though.
[02:33:27.433 --> 02:33:29.894]  Oh, everyone knows about it overseas.
[02:33:30.054 --> 02:33:32.494]  Everyone knows that 9-11 wasn't an inside job.
[02:33:32.534 --> 02:33:40.476]  Like, when I lived in Ukraine, I was a teacher over in Ukraine, and I would tell my students this, and they'd be like, oh yeah, we know, we know.
[02:33:41.380 --> 02:33:54.891]  Everyone overseas knows that it's a complete fraud and inside job, and they're so confused as to why the American people, who they actually have respect for, they don't have respect for the American government, but they have respect for the American people, and they're just confused as to why we don't see it.
[02:33:55.672 --> 02:34:03.438]  Well, that's because it scared the American people, and tell them it's scarier when you actually live in the country that did it.
[02:34:03.914 --> 02:34:05.314]  You know, run by the people that did it.
[02:34:05.334 --> 02:34:10.516]  You know, it's like a lot of people couldn't recognize Hitler living under him because they couldn't face it.
[02:34:10.936 --> 02:34:11.836]  Or under Stalin.
[02:34:12.197 --> 02:34:13.677]  But listen, good to hear from you, Kyle.
[02:34:13.717 --> 02:34:14.577]  Call back again.
[02:34:14.957 --> 02:34:16.418]  Matt in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:34:16.458 --> 02:34:16.798]  Welcome.
[02:34:19.399 --> 02:34:19.659]  Hello?
[02:34:19.859 --> 02:34:20.139]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:20.179 --> 02:34:20.499]  Go ahead.
[02:34:21.379 --> 02:34:21.919]  Yeah, hi.
[02:34:21.999 --> 02:34:22.680]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:22.980]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.641]  I would like to bring attention to your callers and yourself.
[02:34:25.881 --> 02:34:27.601]  A guy named Kent Hovind.
[02:34:27.721 --> 02:34:28.481]  He's a pastor.
[02:34:28.521 --> 02:34:32.023]  He travels around the country and he debates evolution versus creation.
[02:34:32.443 --> 02:34:32.783]  Uh-huh.
[02:34:32.823 --> 02:34:33.443]  Oh, there he is.
[02:34:34.415 --> 02:34:42.679]  And I know you talked about that briefly last week, and I just wanted to let you know that the IRS has given Kent Hovind 10 years in prison.
[02:34:42.699 --> 02:34:45.020]  I actually believe he's in Florida.
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:46.500]  I think I've interviewed him a couple times.
[02:34:47.221 --> 02:34:47.581]  Oh, really?
[02:34:48.701 --> 02:34:50.362]  That's the fellow that was from Florida, right?
[02:34:51.143 --> 02:34:51.403]  Right.
[02:34:52.303 --> 02:34:53.744]  He had a museum.
[02:34:54.504 --> 02:34:55.364]  He does the same thing.
[02:34:55.565 --> 02:34:56.605]  Yeah, he's Dr. Dino.
[02:34:57.425 --> 02:35:00.227]  He does the same thing with the videos that you do.
[02:35:00.527 --> 02:35:02.188]  He puts them out for free online.
[02:35:03.564 --> 02:35:06.725]  Check out Dangers of Evolution, I think that's the one I'd like to recommend.
[02:35:06.905 --> 02:35:14.348]  Yeah, all I was saying is that I don't get into how God made things, and I'm not going to sit around and have arguments about this all day.
[02:35:14.388 --> 02:35:17.429]  I'm going to go out and fight government child kidnapping rings.
[02:35:18.049 --> 02:35:24.551]  And then somebody called in and said, what, you're saying you don't believe that it's 6,000 years old?
[02:35:24.611 --> 02:35:27.472]  And I said, well, that's another preacher saying that.
[02:35:27.972 --> 02:35:30.193]  And I just said, I'm not going to get into the whole debate.
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:37.602]  Okay, and that's all I was saying, because most Christians I know do nothing but fight over evolution, all day long.
[02:35:38.562 --> 02:35:41.223]  And I guess it's safe for them to do that, and that's fine.
[02:35:41.883 --> 02:35:50.785]  But that really is about half worship Israel, the other half worship the fight over how old the Earth is.
[02:35:51.912 --> 02:35:55.778]  I think Christians ought to be involved in what the Founding Fathers were.
[02:35:55.798 --> 02:35:59.805]  You know, those that weren't under Beelzebub's complete tutelage.
[02:36:00.225 --> 02:36:01.868]  And, you know, actually fight some tyranny.
[02:36:02.248 --> 02:36:03.530]  Stand up against some corruption.
[02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:04.933]  Stand up for the widows and orphans.
[02:36:05.618 --> 02:36:06.519]  I know God's real.
[02:36:06.539 --> 02:36:07.299]  I don't have to debate.
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:10.422]  I don't have to debate God all day with a bunch of fruitcakes, okay?
[02:36:10.702 --> 02:36:15.206]  I can look at the stars at night and tell you that this didn't pop into existence out of nothing.
[02:36:15.626 --> 02:36:17.668]  I can look at a human cell and tell you that.
[02:36:18.108 --> 02:36:24.653]  I mean, the way they say evolution works is that a pocket watch in the middle of a desert blew together out of sand.
[02:36:24.973 --> 02:36:25.854]  We know it's bull.
[02:36:26.174 --> 02:36:30.898]  But then to have all these, I'm not saying Dr. Dino is, but these kooky preachers over here
[02:36:31.038 --> 02:36:32.258]  I ain't no monkey!
[02:36:32.539 --> 02:36:34.039]  I didn't come from no monkey!
[02:36:34.279 --> 02:36:36.320]  Well, nobody's saying you came from a monkey.
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:41.622]  They're saying you're along the same genetic line, which, you know, some of the genetics is the same.
[02:36:41.682 --> 02:36:44.323]  I share genetics with a dog, because the same creator made us.
[02:36:44.703 --> 02:36:45.163]  Anything else?
[02:36:45.183 --> 02:36:53.726]  Um, also, yeah, I wanted to ask you, whenever the time comes for the national ID card, what are we all supposed to do whenever... That's your decision.
[02:36:53.766 --> 02:36:54.626]  That's your decision.
[02:36:54.666 --> 02:36:56.327]  You already have a national ID card.
[02:36:56.367 --> 02:36:59.908]  Your state driver's license was federally standardized many years ago.
[02:37:00.774 --> 02:37:04.997]  They tell you it's coming as a trick, so you don't know you already have it.
[02:37:05.338 --> 02:37:07.720]  Okay, let's just boil it down to the way it works.
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:08.400]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:09.441 --> 02:37:10.041]  What you gonna do?
[02:37:10.061 --> 02:37:10.422]  I don't know.
[02:37:11.302 --> 02:37:22.851]  I know when some slack-jawed teenager asks me for my, when I'm paying for cash for a fishing rod, or underwear, or shaving cream at the store, and I go, no.
[02:37:23.312 --> 02:37:24.733]  They go, well it's just for marketing.
[02:37:24.773 --> 02:37:26.394]  I go, yeah, and you gotta pay me for that.
[02:37:26.714 --> 02:37:29.877]  I'm here doing you a favor, buying your slack-jawed junk.
[02:37:30.723 --> 02:37:32.224]  And then now it's, I want your phone number.
[02:37:32.284 --> 02:37:33.585]  Oh, I want you to give me this.
[02:37:33.685 --> 02:37:34.786]  I want you to answer a question.
[02:37:35.087 --> 02:37:35.367]  No!
[02:37:36.648 --> 02:37:42.232]  I've tried to buy stuff before at a computer store and they want my name and stuff and ID when I'm buying cash.
[02:37:42.433 --> 02:37:42.673]  No!
[02:37:42.793 --> 02:37:44.434]  And I got smart and I walked out.
[02:37:44.714 --> 02:37:46.716]  They were chasing me down the street going, come back, it's okay.
[02:37:46.736 --> 02:37:47.517]  And I said, get that.
[02:37:47.537 --> 02:37:48.117]  Excuse me.
[02:37:48.317 --> 02:37:49.578]  I said, get out of my face.
[02:37:50.299 --> 02:37:50.679]  Okay?
[02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:53.021]  I'm not buying your garbage.
[02:37:54.142 --> 02:37:55.463]  That's how you behave with these people.
[02:37:55.483 --> 02:38:00.187]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:38:01.314 --> 02:38:04.956]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Illinois.
[02:38:31.678 --> 02:38:39.625]  I actually lived in Corpus before and I moved to Austin for the sole purpose of getting more involved in this because it's more of a protest town.
[02:38:39.705 --> 02:38:43.048]  Corpus is really not very protest-y at all.
[02:38:44.009 --> 02:38:47.072]  All that goes on in Corpus Christi is worshipping Whataburger.
[02:38:47.555 --> 02:38:49.717]  Oh yeah, worshipping, Whataburger, and gang activity.
[02:38:49.977 --> 02:38:57.324]  But what I wanted to say was, I'm willing to come down and donate maybe 10-15 hours of my free time to help you out.
[02:38:57.344 --> 02:38:58.806]  I've got a lot of computer experience.
[02:38:58.826 --> 02:39:00.447]  Sure, listen, listen, here's the deal.
[02:39:00.467 --> 02:39:02.089]  I don't have a big enough office for that yet.
[02:39:02.729 --> 02:39:07.674]  I don't have the funds to get a bigger office properly for that, and then I don't have the time to tell people what to do.
[02:39:07.694 --> 02:39:19.145]  I need to stop everything and for six months build an infrastructure and an architecture to be able to manage things and properly use all the great people that want to help us.
[02:39:20.246 --> 02:39:23.389]  But it's just so much of what I do I have to do.
[02:39:25.379 --> 02:39:27.980]  I do need help and the problem is I like to pay people too.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:32.863]  I don't like to just have people volunteer and then I don't have the capital to hire the people I need.
[02:39:33.183 --> 02:39:39.006]  So the biggest thing listeners can do is go to InfoWars.com and get Terror Storm, get Marshall Law.
[02:39:40.047 --> 02:39:41.628]  Get the new video we're carrying.
[02:39:42.188 --> 02:39:42.929]  Get my films.
[02:39:42.989 --> 02:39:43.549]  Make copies.
[02:39:43.590 --> 02:39:44.330]  Get them out to people.
[02:39:44.690 --> 02:39:45.591]  Make your own film.
[02:39:45.611 --> 02:39:46.592]  You know, you're making a film.
[02:39:46.612 --> 02:39:47.533]  You put a trailer out.
[02:39:47.813 --> 02:39:48.594]  We link to it.
[02:39:48.874 --> 02:39:50.135]  We're here to build everybody up.
[02:39:50.415 --> 02:39:55.920]  You see, that's how you help me as being a leader, starting your own organization, fighting the new world order.
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:59.983]  Because that's the pattern we're trying.
[02:40:00.183 --> 02:40:02.225]  But, I mean, I'm glad you live in Austin, sir.
[02:40:02.405 --> 02:40:04.467]  At a time in the future, I may be able to use some help.
[02:40:05.107 --> 02:40:07.589]  It's just that, I mean,
[02:40:09.056 --> 02:40:12.038]  Just send me an email and we'll put it in the file of people who want to help.
[02:40:12.098 --> 02:40:12.998]  I appreciate your call.
[02:40:14.979 --> 02:40:18.221]  We'll take more of your calls here in a few minutes, but I've got to get to this next audio clip.
[02:40:18.261 --> 02:40:18.962]  I can't play it all.
[02:40:19.422 --> 02:40:22.844]  Here is Glenn Beck calling Rosie O'Donnell all sorts of names.
[02:40:22.864 --> 02:40:24.405]  Now the point is, you can call her names if you want.
[02:40:24.445 --> 02:40:26.426]  I think I did a few years ago on some other issues.
[02:40:26.826 --> 02:40:27.366]  Gun control.
[02:40:27.746 --> 02:40:32.349]  But she's silly and she's ignorant, but she's got guts and guts is enough, as they say in Full Metal Jacket.
[02:40:33.183 --> 02:40:36.509]  Hang on, Private Rosie is silly and ignorant, but she's got guts and guts is enough.
[02:40:36.769 --> 02:40:38.051]  You're fired, scumbag!
[02:40:38.292 --> 02:40:40.335]  Rosie O'Donnell, you're promoted to squad leader!
[02:40:40.676 --> 02:40:41.177]  Disappear!
[02:40:41.197 --> 02:40:44.141]  Alright, but anyways, uh, man, silly there.
[02:40:45.356 --> 02:40:46.257]  She's got courage.
[02:40:46.417 --> 02:40:48.079]  She has nothing to gain out of this but freedom.
[02:40:48.099 --> 02:40:49.941]  You know it freaks her out to know it's an inside job.
[02:40:50.201 --> 02:40:52.303]  Charlie Sheen went through hell over what he did.
[02:40:52.903 --> 02:40:54.345]  You can nitpick their past.
[02:40:54.505 --> 02:40:55.486]  Nobody's perfect, folks.
[02:40:55.506 --> 02:40:56.687]  The point is they're being good now.
[02:40:56.727 --> 02:40:57.748]  They're doing the right thing now.
[02:40:58.028 --> 02:41:00.571]  And I happen to know for a fact she knows all about the New World Order now.
[02:41:00.911 --> 02:41:03.654]  Rosie's had her paradigm massively shifted.
[02:41:03.694 --> 02:41:06.196]  Not completely, but she's coming over to our way.
[02:41:06.697 --> 02:41:06.957]  Okay?
[02:41:06.997 --> 02:41:08.178]  She's coming over to us.
[02:41:08.759 --> 02:41:09.940]  We need to understand that.
[02:41:11.252 --> 02:41:15.176]  I mean, look at the two thieves hanging on the cross by Christ.
[02:41:16.017 --> 02:41:17.980]  It's never too late to turn back, folks.
[02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:25.228]  And people like sniveling, pasty-skinned little chicken necks like Glenn Beck.
[02:41:25.628 --> 02:41:27.310]  I mean, he's a disgusting little creature.
[02:41:27.570 --> 02:41:28.031]  Here he is.
[02:41:29.119 --> 02:41:36.961]  You have Rosie O'Donnell coming out this week on her blog saying that the United States government took down World Trade Center No.
[02:41:36.981 --> 02:41:41.762]  7 to cover, I think it was for Halliburton or Enron, one of those companies.
[02:41:41.802 --> 02:41:42.962]  She's making that charge.
[02:41:43.162 --> 02:41:53.344]  How is that a mainstream point of view in America that shouldn't have a very strong balance to it in that program or another program?
[02:41:53.564 --> 02:42:01.031]  Well, frankly, I don't care what happens on The View, because I only seem to see clips of it when Danny DeVito comes on drunk, or when Rosie does something outrageous.
[02:42:01.812 --> 02:42:05.096]  What I have a problem with is what this represents for the broader left, and I think you're right.
[02:42:05.116 --> 02:42:14.765]  This conspiratorial mindset is very problematic, because how can you engage in a debate with someone when you are going from facts, and they are going from their own facts, right?
[02:42:15.005 --> 02:42:16.407]  They have this worldview...
[02:42:17.532 --> 02:42:21.273]  They name-crawl, they say they have facts, and they say our facts are lies.
[02:42:21.313 --> 02:42:22.613]  No, we have the facts.
[02:42:22.713 --> 02:42:23.554]  We have the evidence.
[02:42:23.614 --> 02:42:24.374]  We've put it on.
[02:42:24.814 --> 02:42:25.734]  That's why you're losing.
[02:42:26.034 --> 02:42:27.815]  Folks, I see fear in all their faces.
[02:42:28.355 --> 02:42:34.217]  Because their ratings are plunging, no one's watching them, no one believes them anymore, and people are looking at the facts.
[02:42:34.457 --> 02:42:34.977]  Yahoo!
[02:42:35.017 --> 02:42:35.397]  Here it is.
[02:42:36.112 --> 02:42:39.536]  ...are going from facts, and they are going from their own facts, right?
[02:42:39.756 --> 02:42:44.201]  They have this worldview that's made up out of whole cloth, this fictional mythology.
[02:42:44.221 --> 02:42:49.747]  Well, you can't have a debate where you're taking facts and they're taking storybook time.
[02:42:49.807 --> 02:42:50.648]  Okay, stop right there.
[02:42:51.149 --> 02:42:53.051]  Fictional mythology.
[02:42:54.071 --> 02:43:04.535]  I mean, the 9-11 narrative, within 20 minutes they said, the world's changed, your freedoms are gone, it's a new world order, everything's different now, everything will be different, this is the new foundation of Earth.
[02:43:05.055 --> 02:43:07.376]  Every decision you ever make will be off this.
[02:43:08.256 --> 02:43:09.277]  It's all over!
[02:43:09.317 --> 02:43:10.217]  We've got to torture!
[02:43:10.237 --> 02:43:14.078]  And it's a total mythology.
[02:43:14.679 --> 02:43:17.980]  Your official story is the biggest conspiracy theory of it all.
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:20.921]  Continue with Chicken Necks program.
[02:43:21.710 --> 02:43:23.230]  Taking storybook time.
[02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:24.351]  It doesn't work.
[02:43:24.431 --> 02:43:27.411]  And then, when you can't have a debate, you end up getting fights.
[02:43:27.771 --> 02:43:29.792]  And the civility and discourse is gone.
[02:43:30.192 --> 02:43:32.292]  And I think it's tragic that we're seeing that.
[02:43:32.612 --> 02:43:33.692]  We've only got 30 seconds.
[02:43:34.913 --> 02:43:38.553]  Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Moore now being discredited by the left.
[02:43:39.434 --> 02:43:41.974]  Al Gore, I think, is going to become the next Cindy Sheehan.
[02:43:42.034 --> 02:43:43.434]  Cindy Sheehan was discredited.
[02:43:44.535 --> 02:43:50.136]  How long does Rosie O'Donnell keep her credibility when she's saying conspiracy theories about 9-11 and everything else?
[02:43:52.020 --> 02:43:55.741]  You lost me, Glenn, when you said Rosie O'Donnell has credibility.
[02:43:55.801 --> 02:43:56.141]  She has.
[02:43:56.221 --> 02:44:00.462]  I'm telling you, mainstream people watch The View and they think she's funny.
[02:44:00.742 --> 02:44:07.004]  Yeah, I guess they think she's funny, but do you think many of these people who are watching on daytime television are taking their political cues from her?
[02:44:07.204 --> 02:44:08.765]  That's the scary thing about it.
[02:44:08.785 --> 02:44:10.185]  I mean, that is a serious comment.
[02:44:10.225 --> 02:44:11.605]  Maybe a few, but I don't know.
[02:44:11.645 --> 02:44:12.106]  I think you're right.
[02:44:12.126 --> 02:44:15.086]  Look, Cindy Sheehan, the war mom, they were really excited about her.
[02:44:15.447 --> 02:44:19.068]  And then, of course, it turns out that, yeah, she's a little nuts.
[02:44:19.188 --> 02:44:20.008]  All right, Joel, thanks.
[02:44:21.411 --> 02:44:22.912]  Okay, now did you hear all that?
[02:44:22.952 --> 02:44:23.693]  They repeated it.
[02:44:23.873 --> 02:44:25.014]  It's all sophomoric.
[02:44:25.054 --> 02:44:25.734]  It's a formula.
[02:44:26.115 --> 02:44:26.655]  You're nuts.
[02:44:26.695 --> 02:44:27.175]  You're nuts.
[02:44:27.215 --> 02:44:27.656]  You're nuts.
[02:44:27.696 --> 02:44:28.156]  You're nuts.
[02:44:28.456 --> 02:44:29.717]  You're not the mainstream.
[02:44:29.997 --> 02:44:32.419]  The mainstream of people don't listen to them.
[02:44:32.719 --> 02:44:34.321]  The mainstream isn't into this.
[02:44:34.621 --> 02:44:36.222]  The mainstream is against it.
[02:44:36.462 --> 02:44:37.903]  You'll be looked down on.
[02:44:38.243 --> 02:44:41.646]  That's a message to all of you not to speak up and not to get involved.
[02:44:42.046 --> 02:44:55.598]  That's a message to you that, oh, the sheep are all going in this direction, the school of minnows, the school of sardines are all swimming in this direction, the school of lemmings are running off this particular parapet.
[02:44:56.899 --> 02:44:58.500]  I mean, just look at it!
[02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:02.003]  It's all psychological base mindlessness!
[02:45:03.104 --> 02:45:09.770]  I heard another clip of her, of him talking about how he called her a fat witch, so I guess there's more going back or something?
[02:45:10.996 --> 02:45:11.996]  Oh, that one's ready too?
[02:45:12.016 --> 02:45:14.197]  Oh, we don't have time to get to it.
[02:45:14.237 --> 02:45:16.297]  Okay, I'll just make sure I did hear that yesterday.
[02:45:16.317 --> 02:45:17.218]  I thought I was going crazy.
[02:45:17.578 --> 02:45:18.298]  So you do have that.
[02:45:18.338 --> 02:45:21.339]  Well, maybe after the next break if we have time, we'll play it.
[02:45:21.459 --> 02:45:24.880]  But, I mean, these are tactics.
[02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:27.880]  Do you like tactics being used against you?
[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:29.681]  I mean, I don't have to sit here and formulate tactics.
[02:45:29.721 --> 02:45:32.581]  I just come on the air, cover the news, let it all hang out.
[02:45:33.142 --> 02:45:35.962]  Just a normal person who sees the tyranny and I'm going to fight it.
[02:45:36.302 --> 02:45:37.083]  I'm threatened by it.
[02:45:37.123 --> 02:45:38.523]  You bet I've got my hackles up.
[02:45:39.304 --> 02:45:41.125]  You bet I got my eyes bulging out.
[02:45:42.125 --> 02:45:43.525]  Because I'm in war mode here.
[02:45:43.565 --> 02:45:44.966]  Folks, I know these people are killers.
[02:45:45.866 --> 02:45:48.847]  And they got a bunch of little soft wimps running around cheerleading them.
[02:45:49.127 --> 02:45:56.449]  People who rose in society because they were yes-men and, you know, polished boots with their tongues and their lips.
[02:45:56.569 --> 02:45:57.909]  I mean, I'm not going to be part of this.
[02:45:58.950 --> 02:46:00.310]  And they're scared now.
[02:46:00.330 --> 02:46:01.410]  I mean, you can look at Glenn Beck.
[02:46:01.490 --> 02:46:02.111]  He's scared.
[02:46:02.291 --> 02:46:03.111]  All of them are scared.
[02:46:03.966 --> 02:46:05.707]  And you look, I mean, they are scared, folks.
[02:46:05.928 --> 02:46:07.428]  Number one, they know they're up there lying.
[02:46:07.449 --> 02:46:08.149]  They're not stupid.
[02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:10.951]  Number two, they know they're using psychological tactics on you.
[02:46:11.151 --> 02:46:13.352]  And number three, they can see the tea leaves.
[02:46:13.833 --> 02:46:15.334]  They can read the intros.
[02:46:15.754 --> 02:46:20.997]  And they know this is just going to get worse and worse and worse and worse for them.
[02:46:21.378 --> 02:46:22.759]  And this is not going to go away.
[02:46:22.779 --> 02:46:26.121]  And this is not left or right as they desperately try to contain it.
[02:46:26.501 --> 02:46:30.764]  This is the grassroots who doesn't want to live under terrorism and under tyranny.
[02:46:31.064 --> 02:46:32.405]  I mean, if this isn't terrorism,
[02:46:34.349 --> 02:46:57.391]  I have the actual David L. Crock's attorney, city attorney, I mean I don't just have the, this is unbelievable, I don't just have the actual news article, this is Brooksville, Florida, where they have that big military base and they have that martial law takeover drill that you see in Police State 2, the takeover.
[02:46:58.708 --> 02:47:03.132]  Where the sheriff and police departments are just... I was there, and this was back in the late nineties.
[02:47:03.152 --> 02:47:04.413]  There's cop cars everywhere.
[02:47:04.633 --> 02:47:06.514]  They're constantly stopping everyone.
[02:47:06.554 --> 02:47:16.282]  I mean, you'll go a quarter mile, and there's people pulled out with their stuff being searched, and everyone's in fear, and they see a camera when you're in the Dairy Queen, and they go, don't let the cops see it.
[02:47:16.342 --> 02:47:18.283]  I mean, it's hellish.
[02:47:18.824 --> 02:47:20.185]  Hellish in Brooksville.
[02:47:21.125 --> 02:47:22.667]  And, well, you can see video of it.
[02:47:22.687 --> 02:47:24.748]  And we get chased by the troops and all the rest of it.
[02:47:25.048 --> 02:47:25.989]  I just noticed this.
[02:47:26.029 --> 02:47:27.090]  I was reading it during the break.
[02:47:28.857 --> 02:47:34.221]  Florida City to seize homes over $5 parking ticket.
[02:47:35.362 --> 02:47:38.304]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and this is going to be the model nationwide.
[02:47:38.324 --> 02:47:39.725]  This whole town is a military run.
[02:47:40.286 --> 02:47:46.330]  Florida proposes to foreclose homes and seize cars over less than $20 in parking tickets.
[02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:56.517]  The City Council of Brooksville, Florida voted this week to advance a proposal granting city officials the authority to place liens and foreclose on homes of motorists accused of failing to pay a single $5 ticket.
[02:47:59.133 --> 02:48:01.695]  And it says non-homeowners will have their vehicles seized.
[02:48:03.016 --> 02:48:04.137]  And it goes on for $5.
[02:48:04.337 --> 02:48:11.903]  Of course, a bunch of people in Houston have had their homes seized over, in one case, $35 in parking tickets.
[02:48:12.163 --> 02:48:17.688]  The woman had broken her hip and was unable to pay them, and they did take the home.
[02:48:17.708 --> 02:48:18.909]  I remember interviewing her lawyer.
[02:48:19.549 --> 02:48:20.770]  And they will take yours, too.
[02:48:21.131 --> 02:48:23.773]  And they will blow out the economy where you can't pay these.
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:30.223]  You see, and you can't escape all these petty things, and it's going to be hard time in debtors' prisons.
[02:48:30.763 --> 02:48:32.223]  They're going to set all those up again.
[02:48:32.864 --> 02:48:41.227]  Oh yeah, we're not in tyranny, you little soft... I mean, just looking at Glenn Beck, he radiates weakness.
[02:48:41.708 --> 02:48:42.208]  You're weak.
[02:48:47.734 --> 02:48:53.180]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.561 --> 02:49:01.169]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.900 --> 02:49:08.941]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.341 --> 02:49:20.803]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.063 --> 02:49:24.664]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.024 --> 02:49:26.964]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.304 --> 02:49:31.145]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:44.848 --> 02:51:51.194]  A guy who was the mastermind behind 9-11, she can make him into some sort of a martyr!
[02:51:52.205 --> 02:51:57.867]  Without anybody at ABC, NBC, CBS, mainstream media, they say nothing about that.
[02:51:58.867 --> 02:51:59.327]  Nothing.
[02:52:01.128 --> 02:52:08.790]  She goes off on her opinion every step of the way, but there's a conservative on the set who's shut down!
[02:52:11.090 --> 02:52:12.791]  You can't just say your opinion.
[02:52:13.391 --> 02:52:16.952]  What the hell is this show all about, ya fat witch?
[02:52:17.812 --> 02:52:20.273]  What is this show about?
[02:52:20.293 --> 02:52:20.433]  Okay.
[02:52:21.272 --> 02:52:24.195]  Now, notice it's all about liberal-conservative.
[02:52:24.235 --> 02:52:27.118]  I mean, I watched O'Reilly last night, and I'm not kidding, it was like 50 times.
[02:52:27.398 --> 02:52:30.280]  Liberal, liberal, liberal, ultra-liberal, super-liberal, who's the biggest leftist?
[02:52:30.300 --> 02:52:31.021]  Liberal, liberal, liberal.
[02:52:32.382 --> 02:52:32.663]  Liberal?
[02:52:32.683 --> 02:52:33.243]  I mean, liberal?
[02:52:33.263 --> 02:52:35.385]  You're not mainstream Lynne Beck on CNN?
[02:52:36.406 --> 02:52:38.228]  I mean, and liberal, liberal, liberal?
[02:52:39.049 --> 02:52:44.434]  She was covering... I remember Rosie's rant on that, and she was right about the secret torture, the secret arrest.
[02:52:44.794 --> 02:52:46.876]  She said you can't believe stuff that comes from that.
[02:52:48.329 --> 02:52:50.269]  He supposedly did things that were impossible.
[02:52:50.310 --> 02:52:51.370]  That's now been admitted!
[02:52:52.470 --> 02:52:59.631]  But see, instead of attacking all the credible people who don't have all her baggage, more credible, they claim it's just the nut rosy.
[02:52:59.691 --> 02:53:00.591]  See, they need her.
[02:53:02.372 --> 02:53:11.133]  Before I take a few final calls from Jeff in Illinois and Jeff in Washington State, folks, go to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and JonesReport.com.

[02:54:28.947 --> 02:54:30.128]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:30.668 --> 02:54:33.748]  Okay, I'm trying to hurry here so I can take a few final calls.
[02:54:34.628 --> 02:54:35.789]  Let's talk to Jeff in Illinois.
[02:54:35.829 --> 02:54:36.369]  Jeff, go ahead.
[02:54:36.749 --> 02:54:37.689]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:54:37.869 --> 02:54:38.229]  Good.
[02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:39.509]  I'm just going to be real quick.
[02:54:39.549 --> 02:54:42.230]  I want to tell you about what took place at my daughter's school this week.
[02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:48.831]  All the third graders brought home a letter to where the students had to do a speech on presidents.
[02:54:49.311 --> 02:54:50.271]  And she drew Kennedy.
[02:54:50.851 --> 02:54:53.372]  While all the other kids were talking about
[02:54:54.907 --> 02:55:07.775]  The government history books were telling them my daughter actually stood up and she had a real nice three-fold panel display that was postered with Operation Northwoods and actually had a M4 bumper sticker on it.
[02:55:08.195 --> 02:55:14.019]  But her speech went over the limit and she covered all kinds of things that we all know about.
[02:55:14.039 --> 02:55:16.300]  It was just a real good speech.
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:17.841]  The class applauded.
[02:55:18.461 --> 02:55:21.603]  It's actually on her boards on display.
[02:55:22.436 --> 02:55:28.237]  And, uh, it was just, you know, she's a unique girl, well informed, and, uh... How old is she?
[02:55:28.638 --> 02:55:28.779]  Eight.
[02:55:29.545 --> 02:55:30.566]  Well, you're blessed.
[02:55:31.186 --> 02:55:33.028]  I tell you, that's a wonderful testament.
[02:55:33.328 --> 02:55:35.529]  So she used that to educate the people.
[02:55:35.850 --> 02:55:36.550]  Yes, she did.
[02:55:36.750 --> 02:55:58.586]  She talked about... I helped her, obviously, you know, to try to put it in words that other kids would understand, but she covered the bankers and the mob and the CIA and the generals, and she ended her speech with... She couldn't understand all these powerful people with motive, means, and opportunity, why the press, you know, tried and condemned and actually showed the public execution of Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:56:00.161 --> 02:56:00.762]  Good job.
[02:56:00.862 --> 02:56:02.803]  I apologize to Jeff in Washington State.
[02:56:02.823 --> 02:56:05.284]  We can't get to you because we're out of time.
[02:56:05.324 --> 02:56:07.045]  I didn't play the Jim Cramer clip.
[02:56:07.065 --> 02:56:12.587]  It's up on Infowars.net where he says it's all insider trading, the whole stock market stage.
[02:56:12.687 --> 02:56:13.428]  We already knew that.
[02:56:13.728 --> 02:56:15.489]  Now Jim Cramer money says that.
[02:56:16.149 --> 02:56:17.930]  He's a conspiracy theorist too.
[02:56:18.650 --> 02:56:19.691]  See you back on 74 to 6.
[02:56:20.431 --> 02:56:21.131]  Back on Monday.
[02:56:21.191 --> 02:56:22.032]  God bless you all.
