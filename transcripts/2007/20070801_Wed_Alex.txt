[00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:08.638]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:10.099]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:11.740]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:16.343]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:20.706]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:44.159]  Coming up in one hour, we're scheduled to have Deborah J. Palfrey, the big D.C.
[00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:55.546]  madam, on the broadcast with us to discuss that growing scandal that threatens to engulf the entire government because of the politicians' hypocrisy.
[00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.128]  She is coming up with us here on air in one hour.
[00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:09.211]  It is Monday, the 23rd day of July 2007, and we're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:17.536]  I am so intensely working on finishing Endgame that I didn't even do my Sunday show yesterday.
[00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:20.778]  I ran a rebroadcast, though it was a good rebroadcast, we had it on in the background.
[00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:27.562]  That's how, not even behind isn't the word, it's how important it is for me to finish Endgame properly.
[00:01:28.436 --> 00:01:30.458]  So there's a little piece of trivia for you.
[00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:42.391]  I was chomping at the bit to get on air over the weekend, and then just in the final equation I said, I've just got to stay here at the office, and we worked till 3.30 last night on this film.
[00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:44.473]  It is such an amazing documentary.
[00:01:45.574 --> 00:01:51.040]  That said, it deals with this exact subject, at least a large portion of the film does.
[00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:58.816]  Bush's Marshall Law Plan is so shocking even Congress can't see it.
[00:02:00.757 --> 00:02:03.697]  Executive branch over entire government.
[00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:06.318]  Unchallengeable.
[00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:15.879]  Uber Alice as members of Homeland Security Committee barred from viewing post-terror attack provisions.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.020]  Let me make that clear.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.440]  Congress
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.443]  Passes the laws, Congress instructs the President, who then executes.
[00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:30.768]  The Homeland Security Committee is not allowed to see the Marshall Law Plan.
[00:02:30.808 --> 00:02:36.692]  Now, none of this is secret because Bush has had to claim the powers and executive orders.
[00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.354]  So we actually know exactly what's in there.
[00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:44.438]  We also know from individuals inside FEMA that have leaked the actual documents.
[00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:45.539]  So,
[00:02:46.693 --> 00:03:03.867]  Just as I told you in 1996 that every major phone company has an entire floor that is NSA run, and that everything goes through it, and then it came out, ooh, big breaking news in the San Francisco Chronicle and the ABC News last year, exactly what I told you.
[00:03:04.607 --> 00:03:06.829]  Because we know exactly what they're doing.
[00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.890]  Exactly.
[00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:11.353]  Down to the amounts of money, everything.
[00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:13.579]  That's what intelligence is.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.181]  We don't need to be in the secret meetings and in the bunkers with Bush and Cheney.
[00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:23.262]  We know the 50-year growth of the Gulag Archipelago in this country.
[00:03:24.023 --> 00:03:28.064]  And we know exactly what they've set up and exactly what they're doing.
[00:03:28.424 --> 00:03:37.667]  So I'm going to go over this new report, which is the... I mean, I frankly... I saw this Friday night.
[00:03:39.054 --> 00:03:42.416]  And I, frankly, was freaked out about it all weekend.
[00:03:42.476 --> 00:03:54.282]  Knowing even what I know, just to see them really exercising the powers of a dictator, of a dictatorship, of a despotism, to tyrannize the people.
[00:03:55.122 --> 00:03:57.683]  You see, it's one thing to have martial law powers.
[00:03:57.744 --> 00:04:00.105]  It's one thing to have the mechanisms in place.
[00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:02.686]  It's one thing to build it up.
[00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:04.427]  That was seen under
[00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:09.315]  Jimmy Carter and Reagan and Bush Sr.
[00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:14.279]  and Clinton and now Bush, but it's another thing entirely to pull the trigger.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.901]  And they are pulling the trigger.
[00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.185]  They are pulling the trigger with savage force.
[00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:30.593]  They are openly announcing every day in four or five big statements that they're above everything.
[00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:32.235]  Everything.
[00:04:34.512 --> 00:04:38.153]  And that really concerns me, because we've never seen this.
[00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:40.374]  Not in my lifetime, not in your grandparents' lifetime.
[00:04:40.774 --> 00:04:46.816]  I mean, this is... Not since the 1860s have we seen anything like this.
[00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:55.399]  And folks, you are now seeing the executive literally take control of the legislative.
[00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:56.319]  Publicly.
[00:04:59.986 --> 00:05:00.747]  Terrorism!
[00:05:00.907 --> 00:05:01.627]  Terrorism!
[00:05:01.747 --> 00:05:07.812]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:05:08.072 --> 00:05:09.673]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:05:09.933 --> 00:05:12.395]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:27.365]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:27.726]  government.
[00:05:27.886 --> 00:05:29.687]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:35.969]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:40.590]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:07.911]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:08.312 --> 00:06:15.955]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:23.687]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:24.087 --> 00:06:35.512]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:39.334]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.755]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:45.897]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.001]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:06.362]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.245 --> 00:08:30.346]  I love my family as much as the next person, probably even more.
[00:08:33.287 --> 00:08:41.571]  And over the weekend I had a lot of thoughts about what we face as a society.
[00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:43.111]  They're really doing it.
[00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:49.934]  They're really exercising dictatorial criminal power on the face of everything.
[00:08:50.712 --> 00:09:06.757]  And for Americans that do not know what the separation of powers mean, or Europeans listening, or folks in Asia, Africa, Latin America, or ships at sea, go research the separation of powers between the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
[00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:09.998]  It is extremely important to understand what we're facing.
[00:09:10.058 --> 00:09:14.820]  Now, I happen to have read volume after volume of the Federalist Papers,
[00:09:16.002 --> 00:09:19.365]  And I've also read volume after volume of the Anti-Federalist Papers.
[00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:28.373]  I have read large volumes, indexed, republished, and in many cases actually reprints of newspaper debates.
[00:09:28.674 --> 00:09:34.099]  They would debate each day or each week with each other with different columns that they would write, the Founding Fathers.
[00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:39.744]  And it was of the great consensus, and there were only a few issues that had a consensus.
[00:09:39.764 --> 00:09:42.046]  The Second Amendment, state sovereignty,
[00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:52.004]  But also the separation of powers, and that the Congress was the prime mover.
[00:09:52.124 --> 00:10:01.507]  That Congress, of the delegated separation of powers, had the greater balance of power, though only slight.
[00:10:02.196 --> 00:10:05.058]  Because they understood despotism was the norm.
[00:10:05.118 --> 00:10:08.320]  Despotism continually reared its ugly head.
[00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:18.067]  Liberty was that unknown holy grail that they had finally attained at least some semblance of and they wanted to shepherd and lay down defenses to guard it.
[00:10:19.648 --> 00:10:27.814]  And the founders talked about how because the legislative had the most members from their diverse communities,
[00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:43.827]  And because it would be harder to get a dictatorship because of the separation of powers, within the legislative itself, then set upon and set against the division of powers, separation of powers with the judicial and the executive.
[00:10:44.908 --> 00:10:49.051]  Of the three branches, the executive was to be the weakest.
[00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:52.874]  Now, Alexander Hamilton later came along and said, no, we should make
[00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:59.954]  The Presidency, a king, and the Parliament, or the Congress, should be a vassal, as well as the courts.
[00:11:00.434 --> 00:11:02.915]  And they said, let's step outside, and they killed him.
[00:11:04.536 --> 00:11:06.237]  Okay, that's how that was handled.
[00:11:06.257 --> 00:11:07.778]  Let's just step outside, punk.
[00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:11.831]  And in those days, people would step outside and that was the end of it.
[00:11:12.252 --> 00:11:14.013]  That was handled quite quickly and quite easily.
[00:11:14.293 --> 00:11:18.736]  A lot of other people that wanted to have a monarch or wanted to have a police state got killed.
[00:11:19.197 --> 00:11:25.821]  You know, they said, we just fought a revolution and step outside or you're a coward.
[00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:29.684]  So, and they would step outside and they would die.
[00:11:30.445 --> 00:11:36.029]  Because generally, the chicken necks that wanted a police state weren't quick enough on the draw or fast enough with their sword.
[00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:40.516]  They weren't on guard, as they say.
[00:11:40.536 --> 00:11:43.738]  But I'm already digressing here, my friends.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.641]  We have seen this chain of events.
[00:11:48.701 --> 00:12:04.692]  I mean, last year, when the federal government, under the out-of-control executive, came out and funded tens of billions of dollars in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[00:12:05.885 --> 00:12:06.605]  Of 2007.
[00:12:07.466 --> 00:12:08.746]  For martial law.
[00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:11.907]  And it says for insurrection.
[00:12:11.987 --> 00:12:13.568]  It says for resistance.
[00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:20.611]  And it uses term after term after term describing rebellion.
[00:12:20.631 --> 00:12:22.512]  It uses the word rebellion.
[00:12:24.813 --> 00:12:27.914]  If you ask yourself, what rebellion are they planning on us having?
[00:12:28.274 --> 00:12:33.136]  What is it that's so horrible that the government believes yuppies are going to rebel?
[00:12:35.709 --> 00:12:36.990]  What is it they're planning to do?
[00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:43.753]  And then, of course, you have the, not just the Defense Authorization Act, but Patriot Act 1 and Patriot Act 1.5.
[00:12:44.113 --> 00:12:46.794]  They never got the entire expansion they wanted.
[00:12:47.574 --> 00:12:48.034]  Thank God.
[00:12:48.395 --> 00:12:51.976]  And then you've got the Military Commissions Act, which says they can strip U.S.
[00:12:51.996 --> 00:12:56.498]  citizens secretly of citizenship, secretly torture you, secretly execute you.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.142]  And the President then starts announcing the Vice President is above the law and outside the executive.
[00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:09.646]  And then last week, Cheney then declared executive privilege.
[00:13:09.686 --> 00:13:12.710]  So he's outside the executive, but he also has executive privilege.
[00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:20.241]  And now they just told Congress that no one, not even grand juries, can indict any members of the White House staff for any crime.
[00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:21.763]  We are the law.
[00:13:23.173 --> 00:13:37.928]  I mean, folks, when a branch of government starts announcing that it is above the law publicly, I mean, now they're just saying they're above regular run-of-the-mill laws, as we said they would do if they were really getting ready for martial law.
[00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:44.715]  And they're setting these precedents, they're announcing these powers over and over and over and over again.
[00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.193]  And the federal government, Homeland Security, is constantly locking down the Capitol.
[00:13:51.254 --> 00:13:53.696]  They're now constantly shoving congressmen and women around.
[00:13:54.036 --> 00:14:10.070]  I've seen them on the news when a congressman is on television with a news camera out front the Capitol and some car backfires and men run up and start yelling and screaming and hatefully shoving congressmen who are totally separate and above them.
[00:14:12.347 --> 00:14:14.207]  But you see, it's the executives' troops.
[00:14:14.468 --> 00:14:15.328]  That's what Caesar did.
[00:14:15.368 --> 00:14:16.708]  He brought in his legions.
[00:14:16.988 --> 00:14:19.489]  He made them the Praetorian, the Legion of Rome.
[00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:22.309]  They'd never been allowed to have legions in Rome before.
[00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:25.130]  Now they brought in their legions, and the first Legion of Rome!
[00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.691]  The Praetorian Guard!
[00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:32.252]  The Praetorian Guard run around in literal Darth Vader outfits designed decades ago for intimidation.
[00:14:35.413 --> 00:14:40.654]  And we learn a year plus ago, and we got the actual documents and ended up making the news nationally,
[00:14:41.886 --> 00:14:46.849]  Thanks to Pastor Bush Paul and his contacts in Pennsylvania, and then we get 13,000 plus counties.
[00:14:47.369 --> 00:14:49.190]  Every county in the US, there's that many.
[00:14:50.611 --> 00:14:51.792]  Over a hundred in Texas alone.
[00:14:53.313 --> 00:14:58.496]  That... No, it's 13,000 plus preachers in thousands of counties.
[00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.797]  We have all the articles, all the documents.
[00:15:01.237 --> 00:15:02.518]  We have links to it up in this story.
[00:15:02.558 --> 00:15:06.700]  Bush's martial law plan is so shocking, even Congress can't see it.
[00:15:08.982 --> 00:15:09.302]  Okay?
[00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:22.247]  And it said in there that they had gotten the preachers ready, coast-to-coast, and they were already preaching, turn in your guns when the government says, go to the relocation centers, take the inoculations, don't resist, it's of the Lord.
[00:15:22.647 --> 00:15:23.027]  Romans 13.
[00:15:23.647 --> 00:15:39.438]  The federal government, secretly, is teaching preachers, and this is now admitted, they now admit it, coast-to-coast, to tell their flocks to submit to government and hand their guns in, and take inoculations, and let their children be taken on separate vehicles to separate facilities.
[00:15:40.447 --> 00:15:43.289]  They're having drills coast-to-coast and the schools doing the same thing.
[00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.471]  I mean, that's right out of Red Dawn.
[00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:50.474]  That's right out of America with a K. That's right out of Soviet Union.
[00:15:50.494 --> 00:15:51.915]  That's right out of nightmares.
[00:15:56.259 --> 00:16:05.305]  And then, members of the Homeland Security Committee, because if you read carefully, it's the whole committee's been denied, said, we'd like to see provisions of what Bush signed May 17th.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:17.502]  Presidential Decision Directive 51 that says in the first couple paragraphs, if there's an emergency, Bush is above the Congress now.
[00:16:17.842 --> 00:16:20.742]  It's a headline, Bush grants himself new powers.
[00:16:20.782 --> 00:16:24.083]  That was one of the mainstream media headlines.
[00:16:24.163 --> 00:16:27.884]  Bush grants himself, it'd be like if Alex Jones says he's above the law.
[00:16:28.124 --> 00:16:29.784]  Alex Jones says he can rob banks.
[00:16:29.804 --> 00:16:31.425]  It's the same thing.
[00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:33.725]  No one is above the law.
[00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.093]  Unless you're a dictator and you then claim that prerogative and have the force to enforce that.
[00:16:40.134 --> 00:16:44.436]  And so the President comes out and says, secret continuity of government.
[00:16:44.977 --> 00:16:48.459]  If we're attacked, Congress no longer has authority.
[00:16:49.099 --> 00:16:50.420]  I am above Congress.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.982]  They are not involved in continuity of government.
[00:16:54.303 --> 00:16:57.725]  And so Congress says, we would like to see that plan.
[00:16:58.025 --> 00:16:59.326]  And what does President Bush say?
[00:16:59.966 --> 00:17:00.266]  No.
[00:17:01.227 --> 00:17:02.528]  You cannot see it.
[00:17:03.328 --> 00:17:04.029]  I am above you.
[00:17:07.873 --> 00:17:24.480]  Now ladies and gentlemen, if that doesn't cause serious chills to run up the length and breadth of your spine, your brain getting into fight mode going, whoa, I feel something bad looking down on me, then you don't have any survival mechanism left in you.
[00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:35.084]  And it came out in the Oregonian, it also came out in several other newspapers.
[00:17:37.449 --> 00:17:41.333]  Congressman denied access to federal post-terror attack plans.
[00:17:43.335 --> 00:17:44.396]  This is the Oregonian.
[00:17:45.477 --> 00:17:54.845]  Oregonian's called Peter DeFazio's office, worried that there was a conspiracy buried in a classified portion of a White House plan for operating the government after a terror attack.
[00:17:55.546 --> 00:18:00.591]  Well, he wasn't buried, it's said in the PDD that he is Supreme Ruler.
[00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.671]  There is no Bill of Rights, there is no Congress.
[00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.672]  I mean, you can stick a fork in it right there.
[00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:07.393]  He is announcing those powers.
[00:18:07.433 --> 00:18:25.602]  Now, with this action, he is fully declaring them a second time and implementing one of the most central actions of a dictator to tell the Parliament, hey, you don't matter.
[00:18:26.346 --> 00:18:26.986]  I'm over you.
[00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:28.727]  I mean, what does Emperor Palpatine do?
[00:18:28.747 --> 00:18:36.652]  You know, let's use entertainment or the movie analogy, because that can reach some people that don't know history.
[00:18:36.892 --> 00:18:38.132]  Remember the bad man?
[00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:46.477]  Stages of events, stages of terror attacks, so he can come out and announce himself Emperor, and then put regional governors in control?
[00:18:46.857 --> 00:18:50.259]  See, when that happens, things are not going well.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:51.720]  Okay?
[00:18:53.574 --> 00:19:01.978]  Oregonians called Peter DeFazio's office worried there was a conspiracy buried in the classified portion of the White House plan for operating the government after a terror attack.
[00:19:02.758 --> 00:19:03.759]  As a member of the U.S.
[00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:08.941]  House Homeland Security Committee, DeFazio of Oregon is permitted to enter a secure bubble room.
[00:19:09.401 --> 00:19:10.121]  Oh, how nice!
[00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:11.062]  He's permitted!
[00:19:11.422 --> 00:19:12.542]  He's elected by us!
[00:19:12.782 --> 00:19:13.843]  He's a Bob Bush!
[00:19:14.223 --> 00:19:15.203]  But see, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:16.264 --> 00:19:17.364]  Oh, he's permitted.
[00:19:17.384 --> 00:19:19.105]  See how the executive already has creeped in?
[00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:20.966]  In the Capitol,
[00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.211]  And examine classified materials, so he asked the White House to see the secret documents.
[00:19:26.672 --> 00:19:28.712]  On Wednesday, DeFazio got his answer.
[00:19:28.912 --> 00:19:29.713]  Denied.
[00:19:30.613 --> 00:19:33.034]  As the entire committee has been denied.
[00:19:33.054 --> 00:19:39.956]  He said, maybe the people who think there's a conspiracy out there are right, DeFazio said.
[00:19:40.496 --> 00:19:43.117]  Hey DeFazio, go read PDD 50.
[00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:48.839]  The declarative announcement of dictatorship is there.
[00:19:50.403 --> 00:19:53.229]  Then we reverse engineered what their attack profile is.
[00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:54.932]  When we get back, we'll tell you what that is.
[00:20:01.523 --> 00:20:12.768]  Now, you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:20:12.988 --> 00:20:20.972]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:20:21.252 --> 00:20:30.937]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals
[00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:33.578]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[00:20:33.618 --> 00:20:34.779]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.100]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.867 --> 00:21:06.570]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:06.591 --> 00:21:11.434]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:11.634 --> 00:21:14.356]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:14.416 --> 00:21:15.537]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:21.481]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:22.402 --> 00:21:29.587]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:30.643 --> 00:21:33.704]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:35.845 --> 00:21:39.306]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:40.286 --> 00:21:42.266]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:42.446 --> 00:21:44.027]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.067 --> 00:21:50.929]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:51.609 --> 00:21:52.029]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:52.269]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.641]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:12.204]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:12.644 --> 00:22:19.846]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:26.064]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:26.545 --> 00:22:37.378]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:38.138 --> 00:22:40.161]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:40.701 --> 00:22:43.482]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:22:43.522 --> 00:22:43.662]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:22:43.682 --> 00:22:45.302]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:49.123]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:23:06.562 --> 00:23:22.736]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[00:23:23.676 --> 00:23:28.881]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[00:23:29.705 --> 00:23:37.651]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:38.652 --> 00:23:39.173]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:39.193 --> 00:23:39.513]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:39.553 --> 00:23:40.934]  The call is free.
[00:23:40.954 --> 00:23:45.318]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:24:19.981 --> 00:24:41.739]  Mid-level and even high-level FEMA officials from congressional testimony that we even have video footage of in 1986, from preachers, from police officers, people who have been recruited by FEMA, from their own documents, because again, they have to break these down into order-level memorandum to go out to the different subdivisions.
[00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:44.561]  We have a crystal-clear picture.
[00:24:45.905 --> 00:24:49.930]  Of what has been built in this country, and let me just tell you what's been built.
[00:24:51.332 --> 00:24:53.935]  We have gone, and again, this isn't about Bush, okay?
[00:24:53.955 --> 00:24:54.916]  This is ongoing.
[00:24:54.936 --> 00:24:56.358]  This is the elite making their move.
[00:24:56.398 --> 00:24:57.119]  Bush is a puppet.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.924]  It's like Hillary or whoever comes after her will be if we don't get Dr. Paul in.
[00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:06.378]  This is a movement by the elite.
[00:25:06.438 --> 00:25:09.479]  In 1986, they started a secret program with U.S.
[00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:14.061]  citizens at labor camps at 12 locations in the United States.
[00:25:14.662 --> 00:25:22.045]  A copy of the document with a phone number to the Army, Yanni Wildanger was the contact, talks about it.
[00:25:22.065 --> 00:25:23.465]  It was kept secret from 86 until 97.
[00:25:26.047 --> 00:25:28.069]  That's just one little piece of it, okay?
[00:25:28.089 --> 00:25:31.693]  There's thousands and thousands of points here that we could go over, that we have studied.
[00:25:31.713 --> 00:25:33.335]  It's like, people say, well, how do you know all this?
[00:25:33.375 --> 00:25:34.336]  You get the knowledge.
[00:25:34.756 --> 00:25:39.120]  So much knowledge studying in every day, and, you know, it's the point of even trying to articulate it, it's hard.
[00:25:40.742 --> 00:25:41.423]  But let me try.
[00:25:41.443 --> 00:25:49.311]  They've also gone from having less than a million in the system to over seven million in the system, four million behind bars in any one time.
[00:25:50.245 --> 00:25:54.769]  They've also built prisons all over the country that are now stand empty, that were never filled.
[00:25:55.009 --> 00:25:58.833]  They have refurbished places like Manazar in the high desert of California.
[00:25:59.493 --> 00:26:11.424]  Over 200 former prisoner of war camps that held Germans and their allies in World War II, including one right outside Austin, Texas in Bastrop.
[00:26:12.128 --> 00:26:14.450]  A former prisoner of war facility that helped Germans.
[00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:15.891]  It's been reopened, repainted.
[00:26:16.331 --> 00:26:17.452]  Toilets are in, it's ready.
[00:26:17.732 --> 00:26:22.715]  They've also built emergency relocation centers at airports or near airport spurs.
[00:26:23.195 --> 00:26:24.796]  Pier 57 in New York.
[00:26:25.297 --> 00:26:28.819]  Big, giant bus terminal out over the river.
[00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:30.880]  Can hold over 10,000 people.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.702]  They put over 2,000 in it in one day alone.
[00:26:34.202 --> 00:26:36.624]  Barbed wire fences inside, porta-potties inside.
[00:26:37.004 --> 00:26:38.465]  We got photos from inside out.
[00:26:38.505 --> 00:26:39.846]  Thanks to camera phones, they missed.
[00:26:40.456 --> 00:26:42.158]  Remember what's in the takeover.
[00:26:42.999 --> 00:26:44.480]  Made in 1999.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.202]  Police state to the takeover.
[00:26:47.343 --> 00:26:48.004]  What do we have?
[00:26:48.344 --> 00:26:58.774]  Local news admitting that they've got the old 747 hangers with bolts and chains in the floors, barbed wire facing in, inside the hangers, port-a-potties and cots.
[00:26:59.915 --> 00:27:00.636]  For thousands.
[00:27:01.548 --> 00:27:10.562]  Every major city and then if you got small towns in between your four or five counties, there'll be a federally designed FEMA emergency Threat integration center.
[00:27:10.582 --> 00:27:11.143]  It'll be called the
[00:27:12.162 --> 00:27:17.985]  Tri-County, or the Bi-County, or the Quad-County Emergency Threat Integration Center.
[00:27:18.005 --> 00:27:19.625]  But really, it's all FEMA paid for.
[00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:22.427]  The cameras, the computers, they're always selling them.
[00:27:22.687 --> 00:27:23.727]  Oh, there's a new function!
[00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:25.308]  Now you can track everybody's cell phone.
[00:27:25.328 --> 00:27:27.729]  But this is classified, don't tell everybody.
[00:27:27.749 --> 00:27:32.471]  I need you to sign a national security letter, please.
[00:27:33.171 --> 00:27:36.293]  You'll be getting an extra check now that you're an Auxiliary Federal Officer.
[00:27:36.393 --> 00:27:37.293]  Oh, thank you.
[00:27:37.733 --> 00:27:39.154]  You have no idea.
[00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:42.490]  No idea what you've been brought into.
[00:27:43.611 --> 00:27:51.354]  They're now putting up big high-tension cables all over the United States, in between the medians, on interstate highways, in the middle of nowhere.
[00:27:51.934 --> 00:27:58.237]  Every small town at their four-way stops have FEMA installed, federally funded, through the state governments to further federalize them.
[00:27:59.338 --> 00:28:03.840]  Cameras reading your license plates, scanning your face, reading your lips.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.461]  I mean, it's all going in.
[00:28:06.341 --> 00:28:08.142]  By the way, we are chained, confronted, FEMA.
[00:28:09.016 --> 00:28:13.958]  Over the weekend, and it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, and got FEMA to admit some of this.
[00:28:14.018 --> 00:28:14.858]  It's pretty incredible.
[00:28:14.878 --> 00:28:17.739]  And then they find out there's a camera, and they get mad and say, you can't tape this.
[00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:20.240]  But we're doing an article on that as soon as Aaron gets in.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.602]  I don't blame him for not being in yet.
[00:28:24.562 --> 00:28:26.603]  He'll do a blurb for Jones Report on that front.
[00:28:27.983 --> 00:28:31.505]  It is, and again, there's too much data for my small team to even handle.
[00:28:31.525 --> 00:28:32.545]  I mean, where do I, it's just...
[00:28:33.493 --> 00:28:36.658]  It's the old saying of we're completely surrounded, don't let any of them escape.
[00:28:41.726 --> 00:28:58.090]  Military-Industrial Complex, 30-plus year program to build massive camps, to expand the prison systems, to build relocation centers, to build hubs that are at the center of rail, air, and bus terminals.
[00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.171]  And they've built them everywhere.
[00:28:59.451 --> 00:29:03.532]  They've got bus terminals right by rail, right by ship, right by an airport.
[00:29:03.592 --> 00:29:04.492]  That's where you'll see these.
[00:29:04.532 --> 00:29:08.153]  And they'll admit it's an emergency FEMA relocation port.
[00:29:09.171 --> 00:29:10.334]  And they're building them everywhere.
[00:29:10.354 --> 00:29:12.979]  They're training the local cops in riot gear on their buses.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.349]  They're training the public with the image of rubber bullets being fired for the police to fire real bullets.
[00:29:19.077 --> 00:29:22.800]  They're delivering armored vehicles, helicopters, military surplus, training.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.363]  Delta Force is coming in and liaisoning with local communities.
[00:29:27.063 --> 00:29:28.164]  Slowly building it.
[00:29:28.524 --> 00:29:29.845]  Crafting it lovingly.
[00:29:30.166 --> 00:29:31.447]  Like a craftsman does.
[00:29:32.367 --> 00:29:34.129]  Crafting the death of America.
[00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:35.570]  Again, lovingly.
[00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.952]  Got the country literally strapped down to the lethal injection bed.
[00:29:38.972 --> 00:29:42.215]  The government smiling with extreme pleasure.
[00:29:42.855 --> 00:29:46.518]  We'll be right back to continue with this incredible martial law development.
[00:29:50.111 --> 00:29:53.132]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.032 --> 00:29:56.813]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.254 --> 00:30:02.495]  This is Elizabeth Border.

[00:30:09.737 --> 00:30:10.337]  Hard-hitting?
[00:30:10.697 --> 00:30:13.658]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:15.198]  War in Iran?
[00:30:15.698 --> 00:30:17.339]  A coming One World Church?
[00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:23.423]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[00:30:57.517 --> 00:31:02.858]  Do you know that you can go solar for under $1,200 bucks now?
[00:31:03.378 --> 00:31:04.498]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:31:04.678 --> 00:31:08.819]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:31:09.426 --> 00:31:14.330]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:21.256]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[00:31:22.012 --> 00:31:24.694]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:31:24.874 --> 00:31:34.842]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:31:35.102 --> 00:31:38.825]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:31:38.865 --> 00:31:41.307]  You know, power companies, government.
[00:31:41.707 --> 00:31:45.370]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.591]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:31:46.791 --> 00:31:47.731]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[00:32:29.305 --> 00:32:33.990]  Northern Voice Bookstore offers a broad range of different perspectives
[00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:34.550]  I don't know.
[00:33:07.845 --> 00:33:10.467]  You know, people aren't the only things that die.
[00:33:11.228 --> 00:33:15.992]  Civilizations, societies, races die.
[00:33:17.174 --> 00:33:21.958]  So let's play a minute or two of this song, so you realize the stakes this country's facing.
[00:33:27.128 --> 00:33:32.473]  Seasons don't fear the reaper, nor do the wind and the sun and the rain.
[00:33:32.513 --> 00:33:34.315]  We can be like they are.
[00:33:34.515 --> 00:33:37.097]  So come on baby, don't fear the reaper.
[00:33:37.278 --> 00:33:39.520]  Baby take my hand, don't fear the reaper.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.904]  We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper.
[00:34:30.043 --> 00:34:32.064]  We're good to go.
[00:34:58.869 --> 00:35:00.590]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:10.372]  The globalists see the destruction of the United States as just a notch in their belt.
[00:35:10.692 --> 00:35:22.776]  Not only do they bring in world government, they get to redesign and recodify the laws and the systems of governance into guilty until proven innocent, one-child policies, very oppressive systems.
[00:35:22.816 --> 00:35:26.157]  They can take your bank account, your house, your home, if they feel like it.
[00:35:26.764 --> 00:35:29.846]  The state taking control of families even further than they already have.
[00:35:30.286 --> 00:35:32.247]  This is what they have to offer.
[00:35:33.228 --> 00:35:38.911]  So for all of you that plan to go along with this New World Order, I hope the black uniforms keep you company.
[00:35:38.931 --> 00:35:40.031]  I hope they keep you warm.
[00:35:41.052 --> 00:35:44.394]  Because you are literally destroying your future as well.
[00:35:44.474 --> 00:35:45.875]  Just be apprised of that.
[00:35:45.895 --> 00:35:49.677]  It's always fun at first to stomp around and act tough.
[00:35:50.686 --> 00:35:58.511]  Later, you're going to get to actually walk a mile in the shoes that you so feverishly demanded that we allow you to put on.
[00:36:00.092 --> 00:36:04.074]  Now, we have Congress saying, we'd like to see your new secret plan.
[00:36:04.134 --> 00:36:12.740]  It says here, in your PDD, in your executive order, that you signed in mid-May, that the Congress isn't involved in government anymore, and that you run everything.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.761]  I'm sorry, you can't see that.
[00:36:16.862 --> 00:36:17.663]  In fact, denied.
[00:36:17.703 --> 00:36:18.603]  You're not going to look at it.
[00:36:19.084 --> 00:36:19.664]  We're above you.
[00:36:21.702 --> 00:36:23.343]  Now, Congress is above the President.
[00:36:23.403 --> 00:36:25.143]  Congress funds the President.
[00:36:25.203 --> 00:36:26.443]  Congress directs the President.
[00:36:26.483 --> 00:36:29.544]  See, that's why it meant something back when they stopped declaring war.
[00:36:29.644 --> 00:36:30.925]  Because Congress was instructing.
[00:36:31.225 --> 00:36:32.845]  Congress created a bill of particulars.
[00:36:32.885 --> 00:36:33.646]  What was to be done.
[00:36:33.886 --> 00:36:34.706]  Who the enemy was.
[00:36:34.746 --> 00:36:35.566]  What the goals were.
[00:36:35.886 --> 00:36:36.887]  What the time frame was.
[00:36:36.927 --> 00:36:37.887]  They control things.
[00:36:40.188 --> 00:36:42.728]  People said, oh no, just let the President run things.
[00:36:42.768 --> 00:36:43.449]  He knows best.
[00:36:43.549 --> 00:36:43.889]  Okay.
[00:36:44.849 --> 00:36:46.229]  You didn't read your history books.
[00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:48.330]  Well, now we're seeing it happen.
[00:36:49.272 --> 00:36:51.135]  And Bush may just be shutting these precedents.
[00:36:51.195 --> 00:36:53.159]  I mean, I hope that's what's happening so we can buy time.
[00:36:53.179 --> 00:36:55.804]  Because we are waking people up and making major inroads.
[00:36:56.562 --> 00:36:58.964]  But it started to look like that may not be the case, folks.
[00:36:59.664 --> 00:37:10.491]  You see, everybody saw Bill Clinton building camps and gearing up and funding and setting up federal police and putting up cameras, and I remember by the last two years of he was in office, I said, no, he's not going to declare martial law.
[00:37:10.511 --> 00:37:13.753]  People started asking, are you some kind of hardcore commie?
[00:37:14.153 --> 00:37:14.634]  What do you mean?
[00:37:14.654 --> 00:37:15.334]  He's getting ready.
[00:37:15.374 --> 00:37:15.674]  Look.
[00:37:16.055 --> 00:37:20.638]  And I said, no, the infrastructure isn't robust enough yet, though it's radically growing.
[00:37:21.278 --> 00:37:22.539]  And I said, these people are puppets.
[00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:24.480]  It's going to be the next president or the next.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.901]  And that is still the case.
[00:37:26.591 --> 00:37:46.544]  Bush sets the precedent, sets these things in motion, it doesn't get challenged properly, a Hillary comes in, a Fred Thompson comes in, somebody else comes in, and then they are sitting there with this precedent set and these new powers, and then they move the ball down the field, and the next new old running back moves it down even further.
[00:37:47.774 --> 00:38:10.524]  Though I have to say, when they start saying the President isn't part of the executive, but he is, and all of our, anyone who works for the White House, or the 2,000 plus direct executive employees under his control, and all the agencies under them, we are now above the law, and you can't indict us, you can't subpoena us, you can't, I mean it's getting just la la land right now.
[00:38:11.804 --> 00:38:13.885]  And so a congressman, let me just read you this article.
[00:38:13.905 --> 00:38:15.366]  Let me just read the articles.
[00:38:17.643 --> 00:38:20.864]  See, we're just one more step down the pit here, but this is a big step.
[00:38:21.784 --> 00:38:24.844]  Congressman denied access to federal post-terror attack plans.
[00:38:25.664 --> 00:38:32.906]  Oregonians called Peter DeFazio's office, worried there was a conspiracy buried in the classified portion of the White House plan for operating the government after a terror attack.
[00:38:33.486 --> 00:38:34.686]  As a member of the U.S.
[00:38:34.706 --> 00:38:41.467]  House of... on Homeland Security Committee, DeFazio, a Democrat of Oregon, is permitted... See how they moved that in?
[00:38:41.867 --> 00:38:46.168]  Oh, he's permit... See, first it's... See, they just announce powers that don't exist.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.789]  That's like your neighbor telling you you're allowed to go in your own backyard.
[00:38:50.581 --> 00:38:53.403]  Oh, I'm gonna... You ever had control freaks try that with you?
[00:38:53.423 --> 00:39:00.908]  They'll tell you, oh, you're allowed to do things that you already have a right to do that isn't... See, they're claiming things that aren't theirs.
[00:39:01.329 --> 00:39:12.457]  But see, the Oregonian, I don't think is a bad writer, Jeff Kossoff, the point is, is that Jeff's so conditioned, you know, that, oh, Congress is permitted by the President, how nice of him!
[00:39:13.077 --> 00:39:15.439]  The Fuhrer is permitting them!
[00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:19.902]  Oh, how... I mean, this is... This is... Well, they got a term down here in Texas.
[00:39:21.098 --> 00:39:24.419]  But I'm not going to use it because we have children listening, but it's bleep backwards.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.761]  I mean, this is completely backwards, the way this is supposed to work.
[00:39:30.082 --> 00:39:31.422]  As a member of the U.S.
[00:39:31.442 --> 00:39:42.186]  House on Homeland Security Committee, DeFazio is permitted to enter a secure bubble room in the Capitol and examine classified material.
[00:39:43.187 --> 00:39:45.908]  So he asked the White House to see the secret documents.
[00:39:46.048 --> 00:39:49.049]  On Wednesday, DeFazio got his answer denied.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.341]  And see, this will go unchallenged.
[00:39:52.861 --> 00:39:53.621]  Precedent set.
[00:39:55.382 --> 00:40:03.764]  I just can't believe they're going to deny a member of Congress the right of reviewing how they plan to conduct the government of the United States after a significant terror attack, DeFazio said.
[00:40:04.385 --> 00:40:06.705]  DeFazio, the executive order is there.
[00:40:07.146 --> 00:40:08.766]  It says Congress isn't involved.
[00:40:09.126 --> 00:40:09.466]  Period.
[00:40:10.347 --> 00:40:10.567]  Okay?
[00:40:10.607 --> 00:40:12.627]  It says the President is a dictator.
[00:40:12.988 --> 00:40:17.329]  In clear, black and white English, as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said last week on the show.
[00:40:18.314 --> 00:40:25.519]  Father of Reaganomics, former Wall Street Journal editor, head of the Treasury, under Reagan.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:26.380]  Okay?
[00:40:27.421 --> 00:40:28.802]  I mean, and by the way, I talked to him on-air.
[00:40:28.882 --> 00:40:32.244]  He is, he is the most concerned he's ever been, by the way, folks.
[00:40:32.665 --> 00:40:37.288]  Because he knows history, he's studied history, he's been in the executive, he knows, folks.
[00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:43.393]  We are in deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep trouble.
[00:40:43.573 --> 00:40:43.793]  Okay?
[00:40:44.753 --> 00:40:47.394]  I don't know if it's going to be this month, next year, or Hillary that does it.
[00:40:47.674 --> 00:40:49.734]  But man, you can see them, bunch of wolves.
[00:40:49.834 --> 00:40:50.674]  Just look at them.
[00:40:51.214 --> 00:40:53.855]  Doesn't your gut tell you, much less all the evidence?
[00:40:54.435 --> 00:40:56.036]  I mean, these people are going for broke.
[00:40:57.776 --> 00:40:58.796]  And you know why I know that?
[00:40:58.816 --> 00:41:01.597]  Because they look completely freaked out and exhausted and unhappy.
[00:41:01.617 --> 00:41:03.137]  They're not even smiling anymore.
[00:41:03.157 --> 00:41:04.957]  They're not even enjoying it anymore, folks.
[00:41:05.358 --> 00:41:07.278]  They're following orders to gut this country.
[00:41:08.408 --> 00:41:10.749]  And they know they're going to end up being demonized in the end.
[00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:17.973]  But that's the big thing with the globalists, is that to be a globalist minion, you have to fall on your sword, you have to take one for the team, you have to be destroyed publicly.
[00:41:19.094 --> 00:41:26.198]  Bush knows he's going down in history as a piece of garbage, Hillary knows it, but that's the deal they made to be servants of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.142]  And they get demonized in history, but the system moves on.
[00:41:33.802 --> 00:41:36.404]  And then they'll be rehabilitated later, in the media zone.
[00:41:39.628 --> 00:41:44.391]  I just can't believe they're going to deny a member of Congress the right to review how they plan to conduct the government.
[00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:47.553]  Because the executive order DeFazio says you're not part of it!
[00:41:48.553 --> 00:41:48.934]  Get it?
[00:41:49.654 --> 00:41:56.498]  Homeland Security Committee staffers told his office at the White House initially approved the request, but it was later quashed.
[00:41:57.459 --> 00:42:00.501]  DeFazio doesn't know who did it or why.
[00:42:01.441 --> 00:42:04.603]  We're talking about the continuity of government in the United States of America.
[00:42:05.183 --> 00:42:05.784]  DeFazio
[00:42:07.466 --> 00:42:08.787]  Again, we called DeFazio's office.
[00:42:08.807 --> 00:42:09.628]  They don't know us from Adam.
[00:42:09.648 --> 00:42:10.789]  They said, are you on in Oregon?
[00:42:10.809 --> 00:42:12.450]  That's one of the few states we don't have an affiliate in.
[00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.592]  You know, we're short of internet there and huge presence on the web.
[00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:19.856]  And the office said, well, we're not going to have him on because we don't know who you are.
[00:42:19.896 --> 00:42:21.417]  If you were on in Oregon, we would.
[00:42:21.437 --> 00:42:26.621]  Maybe we need to call DeFazio's office and say, hey, you need to come on Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:26.701 --> 00:42:27.301]  It's a big show.
[00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:28.362]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:42:28.682 --> 00:42:31.985]  We'd like to bring you to DeFazio so we can maybe educate him a little bit.
[00:42:36.023 --> 00:42:42.329]  Read the executive order in PDD 51 to him, and go see here, see what this says?
[00:42:46.173 --> 00:42:49.536]  It says in continuity of government, Congress isn't involved anymore.
[00:42:49.736 --> 00:42:50.077]  That's it.
[00:42:50.277 --> 00:42:50.957]  Dictatorship.
[00:42:51.178 --> 00:42:51.518]  Period.
[00:42:51.878 --> 00:42:53.620]  And it's been congressionally funded last year.
[00:42:55.353 --> 00:42:59.997]  Which, again, shows they're the authority, but it's kind of like shelling someone the gun they kill you with.
[00:43:00.057 --> 00:43:04.401]  It's like in Terminator, where the guy, you know, hands him the shotgun and the shells to kill him with.
[00:43:04.421 --> 00:43:06.302]  You know, hey, you can't do that here.
[00:43:06.422 --> 00:43:06.863]  Wrong.
[00:43:07.443 --> 00:43:08.504]  That's what Bush is doing.
[00:43:09.305 --> 00:43:10.386]  Hey, you can't do that here.
[00:43:10.526 --> 00:43:10.986]  Wrong.
[00:43:13.508 --> 00:43:18.753]  We're talking about the continuity of government of the United States of America, DeFazio says, I think.
[00:43:19.617 --> 00:43:24.341]  That would be irrelevant to any member of Congress, let alone a member of the Homeland Security Committee.
[00:43:24.862 --> 00:43:30.487]  Why didn't you say separation of powers, congressional prerogative and powers under the Tenth Amendment?
[00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:35.892]  Why didn't you just... It's the basic makeup of the country.
[00:43:35.912 --> 00:43:37.354]  It's the chain of command.
[00:43:41.277 --> 00:43:42.538]  And Bush is saying, no!
[00:43:43.539 --> 00:43:44.240]  I'm in command.
[00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:55.673]  Bush administration spokesman, Trey Bond, declined to say why Defazio was denied access.
[00:43:55.973 --> 00:44:00.515]  We do not comment through the press on the process that this access entails.
[00:44:00.995 --> 00:44:07.118]  It is important to keep in mind that such, that much of the information related to the Continental Government is highly sensitive.
[00:44:07.438 --> 00:44:08.779]  Oh, see, it's highly sensitive.
[00:44:08.799 --> 00:44:17.083]  We can't have someone on the Homeland Security or anyone on the committee saying, hmm, because the executive order, the declaration of the new tyrannical power says it.
[00:44:17.343 --> 00:44:18.764]  You're not involved, Mac!
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:27.965]  Norm Olsteen, a legal scholar who studies government continuity at the Conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he cannot think of one good reason.
[00:44:28.345 --> 00:44:31.387]  Doesn't matter if there's a quote, good reason, or something that sounds good to the sheeple.
[00:44:31.647 --> 00:44:33.448]  The President doesn't have this power, Olsteen.
[00:44:33.468 --> 00:44:34.108]  We're going to get him on.
[00:44:34.669 --> 00:44:39.051]  Deny access to a member of Congress who serves on the Homeland Security Committee, he said.
[00:44:39.712 --> 00:44:44.495]  I find it inexplicable and probably reflective of the usual knee-jerk over
[00:44:45.988 --> 00:44:50.449]  extension of executive power that we see from this White House, Ornstein said.
[00:44:50.729 --> 00:44:52.870]  Hey Ornstein, there's nothing knee-jerk about it.
[00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:57.091]  This is the first time DeFazio has been denied access to documents.
[00:44:57.111 --> 00:45:04.393]  DeFazio has asked Homeland Security Chairman Denny Thompson, Benny Thompson of Mass, to help him access the documents.
[00:45:04.813 --> 00:45:08.234]  Maybe the people who think there's a conspiracy out there are right, DeFazio said.
[00:45:08.254 --> 00:45:15.236]  Well, DeFazio, we understand you're good at wearing a fancy suit and tie and playing golf and in business.
[00:45:15.766 --> 00:45:17.347]  And at glad-handing special interest.
[00:45:17.827 --> 00:45:19.429]  But we study this here, Bubba.
[00:45:19.969 --> 00:45:21.490]  And let me just tell you again.
[00:45:22.571 --> 00:45:25.613]  The PDD says why you haven't been given it.
[00:45:26.233 --> 00:45:27.594]  That's why things have changed.
[00:45:27.894 --> 00:45:29.695]  It says you're not involved anymore.
[00:45:30.676 --> 00:45:32.437]  It says you've been cut out of the process.
[00:45:33.198 --> 00:45:34.178]  You understand that?
[00:45:35.719 --> 00:45:42.724]  This is basically like the police department of Austin, Texas telling the mayor he doesn't run anything anymore and is doing whatever they want.
[00:45:43.382 --> 00:45:47.867]  Which I kind of guess they do, so I mean, you know, this is where we're going, alright?
[00:45:48.167 --> 00:45:50.390]  This is what happened in Rome and everywhere else.
[00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:56.216]  It's just the guys in the uniforms, the generals, get together with a clique and they start robbing and running wild.
[00:45:59.319 --> 00:46:05.086]  And it's the norm in history and it's happening here, but I guess bigger and better here in the good old U.S.
[00:46:05.126 --> 00:46:05.306]  of A.
[00:46:08.889 --> 00:46:10.511]  And I have a stack of such stories.
[00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:18.338]  We've got one up on PrisonPlanet.com that indexes this Oregonian story that we want to get up on the main page of Dig so millions can see it.
[00:46:18.698 --> 00:46:19.299]  Please help us.
[00:46:19.679 --> 00:46:23.964]  Bush's martial law plan is so shocking even Congress can't see it.
[00:46:25.245 --> 00:46:32.632]  Executive Uberalus, meaning overall, as member of Homeland Security Committee barred from viewing post-terror attack provisions
[00:46:33.726 --> 00:46:54.519]  President Bush's post-terror attack martial law plan is so shocking that even sitting members of Congress and homeland security officials are barred from viewing in another example of Executive Uberalus in a chilling portent of what is to come as constant reminders of the invariability of terror attacks reverberate.
[00:46:54.899 --> 00:46:57.181]  Yeah, we forget we've got this backdrop of
[00:46:57.797 --> 00:46:59.639]  Terrorists are going to attack us any minute.
[00:46:59.679 --> 00:47:00.540]  Give up your rights.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.303]  New fake Bin Laden videos admitted to be staged.
[00:47:04.443 --> 00:47:05.605]  Constant propaganda.
[00:47:05.645 --> 00:47:13.052]  I mean, when the government's saying Iran's Al Qaeda, but then publicly saying our government's funding Al Qaeda to attack Iran, we've entered la-la land.
[00:47:13.092 --> 00:47:16.155]  We've entered cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs propaganda world.
[00:47:18.237 --> 00:47:19.798]  I mean, I can't even watch the news anymore.
[00:47:19.898 --> 00:47:20.419]  It is so...
[00:47:22.183 --> 00:47:25.844]  Ten years ago, the media would just lie, like they're doing now, because there was no internet to challenge them.
[00:47:26.204 --> 00:47:30.865]  Then, for the last eight, nine years, they kind of would just try to spin things and lie sparingly.
[00:47:31.165 --> 00:47:33.606]  Now, they've gone for broke, which is another indicator.
[00:47:34.146 --> 00:47:37.367]  I mean, just full-out lying about everything.
[00:47:37.587 --> 00:47:39.088]  Spinning, you name it.
[00:47:39.148 --> 00:47:41.748]  I mean, the big, dominant CNN foxes out there.
[00:47:42.648 --> 00:47:48.130]  They show a lot of good, independent media embedded even inside the main systems that slip through editors.
[00:47:50.856 --> 00:47:56.118]  And there's editors having second thoughts who are upset, who are, you know, letting some truth come out and hoping their bosses above them don't see it.
[00:47:57.358 --> 00:48:05.180]  There is a rebellion going on, thank goodness, thank God, right here at the end, right here at the wall, right here at impact point.
[00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:09.122]  I mean, people are finally going, my gosh, Alex Jones and others were right!
[00:48:10.642 --> 00:48:15.203]  See, I've studied history, and so I knew what tyranny looked like when I saw it developing.
[00:48:16.964 --> 00:48:20.565]  I mean, if you know anything about history, folks, we've been down this road over and over again,
[00:48:23.556 --> 00:48:28.380]  But now the government and the criminals that run it don't have spears and shields and short swords.
[00:48:29.481 --> 00:48:36.646]  They've got bio-weapons, chemical weapons, race-specific weapons, brainwashed cops with machine guns, huge FEMA camps everywhere, face-scanning cameras.
[00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:43.732]  And remember, this is the same crowd that flew those planes into those buildings.
[00:48:45.293 --> 00:48:48.836]  And let's just say the government didn't do that for the sake of art, which of course we know criminal elements did.
[00:48:49.392 --> 00:48:51.053]  What about all the declassified admissions?
[00:48:51.113 --> 00:48:53.894]  Israel admits they staged the hostage deal with Idi Amin.
[00:48:54.114 --> 00:48:57.995]  The Germans admit they staged events after the Munich deal with the Muslims.
[00:48:58.955 --> 00:48:59.716]  That's mainstream.
[00:49:00.156 --> 00:49:04.417]  Academy Award winning film has the former head of German intelligence admitting they staged terror attacks.
[00:49:05.558 --> 00:49:08.059]  Hundreds of admitted examples where they staged terror attacks.
[00:49:08.419 --> 00:49:13.060]  Every time I bring this up to neocons or liberals, they just go, oh, you're a liar, that doesn't exist.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.221]  And I go, no, please, please.
[00:49:15.021 --> 00:49:15.801]  Please check it out.
[00:49:15.861 --> 00:49:17.402]  Please, please, please, please.
[00:49:18.354 --> 00:49:20.096]  No, I don't think so.
[00:49:22.297 --> 00:49:25.720]  I'm going to get a pedicure right now.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.161]  Hey, the dollar is plunging.
[00:49:27.201 --> 00:49:28.222]  They are robbing us.
[00:49:28.242 --> 00:49:29.523]  They are robbing our savings.
[00:49:29.803 --> 00:49:32.065]  They are destroying all that this country has left.
[00:49:32.085 --> 00:49:33.266]  We don't have industry anymore.
[00:49:33.586 --> 00:49:35.027]  All we have is the fiat currency.
[00:49:35.528 --> 00:49:37.609]  Fiat currency?
[00:49:37.969 --> 00:49:39.671]  Are you going to build me a burger?
[00:49:39.751 --> 00:49:41.152]  A builder burger burger?
[00:49:44.139 --> 00:49:49.242]  And I'm like, no, no, no, all the top, even conservative top lawyers and scholars are saying we're going into martial law.
[00:49:50.743 --> 00:49:53.805]  I mean, here's a cynical example of what they're doing.
[00:49:55.967 --> 00:50:12.858]  Saturday night, or was it Friday night, I heard on Kelby Jay, or luckily as I was driving home at about two in the morning, Fox News announced President Bush has signed an executive order allowing the CIA to get rough with the interrogation subjects, but banning torture.
[00:50:14.117 --> 00:50:15.157]  Well, that was double-speak.
[00:50:15.597 --> 00:50:23.819]  So I go home, I fire up the computer, I go to the whitehouse.gov, I read the executive order, and it says, you're not allowed to torture, you're only allowed to waterboard people.
[00:50:25.279 --> 00:50:29.960]  Well, that's just a reiteration of what his Chief Counsel, now Attorney General, said in 2002.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.260]  That, well, it isn't torture anymore, we just don't call it torture.
[00:50:35.261 --> 00:50:43.202]  And then, but then AP and everybody else reported, alright, Bush caved in to pressure, he's no longer torturing, well, because they just said they changed the meaning of it.
[00:50:45.336 --> 00:50:45.897]  You see that?
[00:50:48.862 --> 00:50:52.208]  Alright, we'll be right back with some other key news.
[00:50:52.228 --> 00:50:54.031]  We've got a big guest coming up.
[00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:54.833]  Stay with me.
[00:50:54.873 --> 00:50:57.578]  PrisonPlanet.tv is one of the key websites.
[00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:06.133]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:06.473 --> 00:51:08.415]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:08.775 --> 00:51:16.422]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.102 --> 00:51:24.165]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:24.565 --> 00:51:36.010]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.792]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:40.252 --> 00:51:42.193]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:42.533 --> 00:51:46.295]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:00.457]  Terrorism!
[00:52:00.637 --> 00:52:01.357]  Terrorism!
[00:52:01.477 --> 00:52:07.562]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:52:07.803 --> 00:52:09.404]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:52:09.644 --> 00:52:12.126]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:12.506 --> 00:52:27.098]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:27.118 --> 00:52:27.458]  government.
[00:52:27.619 --> 00:52:29.400]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:35.704]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:35.824 --> 00:52:40.306]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:52:59.244 --> 00:53:04.749]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:53:05.189 --> 00:53:09.413]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:53:09.834 --> 00:53:16.700]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:23.841]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:53:24.162 --> 00:53:25.762]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:53:26.062 --> 00:53:29.243]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:53:29.523 --> 00:53:31.983]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:53:32.283 --> 00:53:39.045]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:53:46.227 --> 00:53:48.008]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for Biosolutions.
[00:54:12.874 --> 00:54:25.961]  And all of a sudden the wind blew me away And made me fly in the sky, little angel.
[00:54:26.081 --> 00:54:28.783]  I'll fly, I'll sing,
[00:54:35.627 --> 00:54:36.647]  We're good to go.
[00:55:05.693 --> 00:55:11.638]  I'll tell you right now, I'd rather be with my children at the beach.
[00:55:11.658 --> 00:55:12.658]  Sand all over me.
[00:55:13.359 --> 00:55:14.520]  Drinking a cold drink.
[00:55:16.521 --> 00:55:17.662]  Listen to music like this.
[00:55:18.443 --> 00:55:25.408]  But I'll tell you right now, it's a man's job to stand up against evil and protect your family.
[00:55:25.428 --> 00:55:30.072]  And all you men out there that haven't been involved in the fight against the New World Order, you've got a serious problem.
[00:55:31.113 --> 00:55:32.374]  Because these people are killers.
[00:55:33.564 --> 00:55:41.132]  They've basically already wrecked this country's name in the world, our economy, our currency, and they're going for broke, and they're not working for this country.
[00:55:41.152 --> 00:55:42.434]  They're working for the New World Order.
[00:55:44.116 --> 00:55:48.560]  See, a lot of good old boys say, yeah, we know things are bad, but, you know, America's doing this for America.
[00:55:49.962 --> 00:55:54.647]  If the elite were corrupt and bad, but had some allegiance to the nation, and some allegiance to the people,
[00:55:55.405 --> 00:55:56.866]  It would not be one-tenth as bad.
[00:55:57.386 --> 00:55:59.947]  The point is, this is the most virulent form of elite.
[00:56:00.268 --> 00:56:09.132]  They cold-bloodedly laugh at sovereignty, laugh at allegiance, and they use your allegiance to empower their system, and it's a big joke to them.
[00:56:09.192 --> 00:56:12.534]  They write thousands of books on the subject, laughing at you.
[00:56:12.554 --> 00:56:20.918]  Let me tell you, they go to full martial law and Bush puts troops on the streets and tries to
[00:56:23.564 --> 00:56:25.805]  Do some of the things they're attempting to set up right now.
[00:56:28.647 --> 00:56:35.210]  Police and military are literally going to have the very lifeblood of this country in their hands.
[00:56:37.471 --> 00:56:48.297]  And elites always want to bring in martial law because they've always engaged in so much criminality and corruption that if there's any liberty or decency or justice left, they're going to end up going to jail.
[00:56:48.337 --> 00:56:49.718]  They've got to go for broke
[00:56:51.391 --> 00:56:55.192]  And basically take the country hostage so that they can just maintain their control.
[00:56:57.493 --> 00:56:58.793]  That's also the nature of this.
[00:56:58.853 --> 00:57:05.675]  I mean, as Bush gets his back more and more against the wall, it may cause him to go ahead and trigger... I mean, let me tell you, 9-11 was spectacular.
[00:57:05.835 --> 00:57:11.096]  The Clintons just blew up a federal building, which was bad for 160-something people, including that daycare.
[00:57:11.817 --> 00:57:18.318]  But, I mean, you know, you start killing 3,000 people, or close to that, and you do it in a big, spectacular way, that is chutzpah.
[00:57:19.079 --> 00:57:20.619]  I mean, that is a lot of bravado.
[00:57:22.333 --> 00:57:23.633]  That is super macho.
[00:57:23.913 --> 00:57:25.114]  Mooey mooey macho.
[00:57:25.634 --> 00:57:28.194]  And that shows these guys, these guys are serious.
[00:57:30.535 --> 00:57:31.575]  I mean, they're going for broke.
[00:57:31.615 --> 00:57:32.816]  They like the danger.
[00:57:33.276 --> 00:57:35.076]  They like the fact they're on the razor's edge.
[00:57:36.717 --> 00:57:42.238]  I've gotten reports they even like going on the internet and seeing us talk about them because it like, it's something that excites them anymore.
[00:57:42.842 --> 00:57:47.364]  The hookers and the male prostitutes and the parties and the drugs don't do it anymore, folks.
[00:57:47.404 --> 00:58:00.351]  These people... In fact, I was reading quotes by a bunch of top futurists yesterday about, we're a nihilistic elite who just may want to kill everybody, including ourselves, to be in control.
[00:58:01.101 --> 00:58:01.901]  And give meaning.
[00:58:01.981 --> 00:58:06.523]  I mean, they are... If you've studied elites throughout history, this is what... It's like a sickness they get.
[00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:10.765]  It's like if you dive under a hundred feet with normal oxygen, you get narcosis.
[00:58:11.145 --> 00:58:14.746]  Well, it's kind of like at the heights of power, you get another type of narcosis.
[00:58:16.287 --> 00:58:18.328]  Folks, get the films at Infowars.com.
[00:58:18.368 --> 00:58:21.669]  Get the late, great USA by Jerome Corsi.
[00:58:21.689 --> 00:58:22.069]  We have it for $19.95.
[00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:23.129]  I heard it being sold for $28 today.
[00:58:23.209 --> 00:58:23.389]  It's $26 on

[00:58:57.253 --> 00:59:01.456]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.097 --> 00:59:02.938]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.678 --> 00:59:04.659]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.239 --> 00:59:08.882]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.423 --> 00:59:13.546]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:28.384]  Well, it's been making headlines for the last three or four months.
[00:59:29.024 --> 00:59:31.206]  One of the biggest stories in the country.
[00:59:31.906 --> 00:59:38.211]  And that is a, well in her words, an escort service, in the media's words, a call girl operation.
[00:59:39.092 --> 00:59:40.193]  Much smaller in D.C.
[00:59:40.213 --> 00:59:43.476]  than the male operations, which the politicians really like.
[00:59:44.717 --> 00:59:47.038]  But they've gone after her.
[00:59:47.299 --> 00:59:50.221]  And so she's standing up and saying, I'm releasing this phone list.
[00:59:50.871 --> 00:59:57.355]  Because this is extremely hypocritical, and she joins us to spend the full hour with us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:59:57.735 --> 01:00:01.338]  We'll take 30 minutes of calls on this subject.
[01:00:02.478 --> 01:00:05.060]  Jean, thank you so much for having the courage to come on the radio.
[01:00:06.741 --> 01:00:17.488]  We're going to break here in about three minutes, but in this short segment, just for those that don't know your story or your side of it, just in a nutshell, tell us basically what's happened.
[01:00:19.105 --> 01:00:48.401]  Well, from what I gather, and I'll try to compress it as much as I possibly can because it's a very convoluted and detailed story, but from what I gather, I was under investigation more or less, and it could have been prior to this, but more or less from March or so of 2004 until last October 4th of 2006 when there was a raid conducted on my home, a search warrant executed upon my home.
[01:00:48.996 --> 01:00:54.679]  Now, I'm going to use, I'm using the word investigated or investigation rather loosely here.
[01:00:55.399 --> 01:01:04.744]  It does not appear to have been an investigation into prostitution related services or activities, since, oh by the way, prostitution is not a federal crime.
[01:01:04.764 --> 01:01:13.389]  It is left for the state, states, in the lower state courts, I might say, to adjudicate.
[01:01:14.099 --> 01:01:17.661]  However, it's a local vice issue.
[01:01:17.922 --> 01:01:19.683]  It's a local vice issue, absolutely.
[01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:30.951]  What appears to have taken place, however, is some sort of a gathering of evidence on Deborah Jean Palfrey, sort of a la J. Edgar Hoover style.
[01:01:32.111 --> 01:01:35.133]  Personal information, financial information and the like.
[01:01:35.554 --> 01:01:39.036]  There does not appear to have been any sort of actual
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:47.185]  I gather, and I am 10 months into this now, and I've gone through a civil process, now I'm into a criminal process.
[01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:59.015]  Well, I'll tell you from what I've seen in the past, and just instinctively I've seen this before, they may have been tracking what was going on with your business to use that without your knowledge for higher-ups to actually blackmail people.
[01:02:00.176 --> 01:02:04.019]  That's kind of my thinking, or something as nefarious as that.
[01:02:05.527 --> 01:02:07.248]  Or something as nefarious as that.
[01:02:07.268 --> 01:02:09.668]  That's exactly what we believe has occurred.
[01:02:10.228 --> 01:02:12.329]  Ah, you don't see that in the media.
[01:02:12.369 --> 01:02:13.089]  Please continue.
[01:02:13.749 --> 01:02:16.310]  No, you sure don't.
[01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.951]  And you're very on point with that observation.
[01:02:22.976 --> 01:02:25.778]  Why did they pull the trigger on October 4 last year?
[01:02:25.798 --> 01:02:35.927]  I mean, I could still be ongoing here, except I did a couple of unusual things last year, which I think whoever they are that were watching me became very concerned.
[01:02:36.567 --> 01:02:44.814]  Last July, I put my house of 15, 16 years on the market simultaneously within a few weeks, early August of last year.
[01:02:45.439 --> 01:02:52.153]  I closed my business, the one in question, Pamela Martin & Associates, which I had operated non-stop for 13 years.
[01:02:55.759 --> 01:02:56.940]  That's an unexpected move.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:03.003]  So they thought maybe you were planning to kind of leave the mafia, and they don't ever let you leave, kind of.
[01:03:03.063 --> 01:03:05.444]  You know, that's another very good observation.
[01:03:05.484 --> 01:03:16.230]  You know, as long as the status quo was ongoing, because I was so reliable, I was so dependable, I ran such a nice service, sort of in the style of the Mayflower Madam from New York from back in the 1980s.
[01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:20.292]  No drugs, we paid our taxes every year, believe it or not.
[01:03:21.022 --> 01:03:25.785]  Uh, everything was just so nicely done, and then I, all of a sudden, quit.
[01:03:27.146 --> 01:03:36.832]  Yeah, they got paranoid, and then, uh, the wicked flee when none pursueth, uh, basically because they were paranoid, now they've triggered what they were worried about.
[01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:47.959]  Or, perhaps they were trying to trigger a chain of events, because they had assessed you to cause you to stand up and fight back against them, because they had assessed you psychologically to run, now, a massive blackmailing operation.
[01:03:48.299 --> 01:03:48.739]  Stay with us.
[01:03:48.759 --> 01:03:49.760]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:54.652]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:03:54.972 --> 01:03:57.756]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:03:58.037 --> 01:04:02.183]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:02.623 --> 01:04:03.445]  So what do you do?
[01:04:03.765 --> 01:04:08.332]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:04:08.812 --> 01:04:10.933]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:04:11.413 --> 01:04:26.119]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:04:54.708 --> 01:05:00.176]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:00.557 --> 01:05:08.148]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:08.877 --> 01:05:15.922]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:16.342 --> 01:05:27.769]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:31.552]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:32.032 --> 01:05:33.973]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:34.293 --> 01:05:38.076]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:51.474 --> 01:05:54.417]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:05:54.577 --> 01:05:59.762]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:00.102 --> 01:06:05.467]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:05.827 --> 01:06:06.948]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:16.237]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:06:16.617 --> 01:06:18.219]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[01:07:00.505 --> 01:07:01.625]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.265 --> 01:07:03.085]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.845 --> 01:07:04.706]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.126 --> 01:07:09.046]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.587 --> 01:07:13.707]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.088 --> 01:07:25.850]  Back in late 2001, when Fox News did a three-part series on Israeli spy rings in connection with 9-11,
[01:07:27.282 --> 01:07:28.382]  That was done for a reason.
[01:07:28.422 --> 01:07:29.283]  That was a threat.
[01:07:29.783 --> 01:07:35.845]  Whether it was Fox saying, give me more licenses, or get off my back, or don't audit me, as they were being at the time.
[01:07:36.525 --> 01:07:39.046]  Or whether that was the Bush administration saying something to Israel.
[01:07:39.386 --> 01:07:50.610]  When you see the New York Post come out and say that, what, three years ago, that the Bohemian Grove busses in $2,000 an hour gay porn stars to service our Christian conservative leaders.
[01:07:51.331 --> 01:07:51.651]  I think so.
[01:08:02.486 --> 01:08:03.306]  We're good to go.
[01:08:25.897 --> 01:08:28.078]  And Malacosa Nostra, I mean the larger Wasp Mob.
[01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:30.759]  Jean Palfrey is our guest.
[01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:31.819]  She's the big D.C.
[01:08:31.939 --> 01:08:34.720]  madam, ladies and gentlemen, and you've got the floor.
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:35.460]  Please continue.
[01:08:36.521 --> 01:08:39.502]  Well, you know, I wasn't part of the boys' crowd here.
[01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:42.783]  You know, if I was a member, I didn't know I was a member.
[01:08:42.823 --> 01:08:43.563]  Let me clarify that.
[01:08:43.583 --> 01:08:51.046]  Well, that's what I mean, but I mean, once you've done a bit, exactly, but I'm saying once you've done business, once you become a fixture, they get real scared once they see you leave.
[01:08:51.869 --> 01:09:10.714]  You know, and I think that's exactly what happened, because not only did I put my house on the market in late July, unexpectedly closed the business in early August, a few months later I wired $70,000 on September 28th to Germany to buy a small retirement flat, a 100,000 euro flat, which is about $125,000.
[01:09:13.667 --> 01:09:31.895]  And this wire transfer was picked up on this Bush terrorist tracking program, all wires going into and out of the country, because the next day what appeared to have been, and again I use the word investigation very loosely, would appear to have been some sort of two and a half plus year, 31 month investigation at this point in time.
[01:09:32.436 --> 01:09:37.038]  The next day on September 29th, the feds went into warp mode
[01:09:37.498 --> 01:10:06.012]  We made plane reservations and within a few days, the following Tuesday, October 3rd, we had two postal inspectors, I had two postal inspectors, Agent Joe Clark and Agent Maria Kuvion, calling my realtor, now keep in mind my house is on the market, the for sale sign is in the front yard, calling my realtor while I'm in Germany closing escrow on my little retirement flat, asking my realtor if they could see the property that afternoon.
[01:10:07.549 --> 01:10:13.518]  They were not identifying themselves as postal agents from the United States Postal Inspector's Office.
[01:10:13.799 --> 01:10:23.193]  They were identifying themselves as Joe and Maria, a couple... Yeah, that's extremely illegal for the feds, without a warrant, to use some trick like calling your realtor to get in your house.
[01:10:24.502 --> 01:10:30.207]  They were identifying themselves as Joe and Maria, a couple being transferred from Washington, D.C.
[01:10:30.247 --> 01:10:31.228]  to San Francisco.
[01:10:31.288 --> 01:10:32.329]  They loved my neighborhood.
[01:10:32.369 --> 01:10:33.250]  They loved my house.
[01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:35.091]  Could they see the house that afternoon?
[01:10:35.111 --> 01:10:36.672]  They had to see it that afternoon.
[01:10:36.993 --> 01:10:47.041]  Well, my agent had to tell them that her client was in Europe for another week, and that two, her client would not allow the house to be seen without being present, and she did not have a key.
[01:10:47.924 --> 01:10:57.651]  At this point in time, I surmise that these two postal inspector agents, Joe Clark and Maria Kubion, who flew cross-country from Washington, D.C.
[01:10:57.772 --> 01:11:12.203]  especially for this little event to get into my property, I believe for a little look-see, a little fishing expedition, I think they panicked at that point because that's when they went up to Sacramento, which is about an hour drive from where I live.
[01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:13.964]  They went to a magistrate.
[01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:22.521]  They got and obtained, unbelievably obtained, a search warrant based upon information three to five years old.
[01:11:22.882 --> 01:11:32.927]  Now if you're listening audience may not understand the probable cause that's necessary time-wise for a warrant.
[01:11:33.407 --> 01:11:42.152]  Rarely are warrants issued on information any older than six months anywhere in this country in any type of situation.
[01:11:42.611 --> 01:11:51.002]  They went to this magistrate, they got a warrant based upon information, three to five years old, written in third person by Agent Maria Kuvion.
[01:11:51.062 --> 01:11:58.452]  And that's all because of the new anti-terror paradigm, that's how you originally had your wire transferred intercepted, was their own terror system.
[01:11:59.319 --> 01:12:00.400]  That's right, that's right.
[01:12:00.661 --> 01:12:01.541]  There's no question.
[01:12:01.842 --> 01:12:14.294]  There was no, in other words, there was no warrant at my bank, which was the Wells Fargo Bank at the time, where I made the wire transfer from, from a money market account to an escrow agent over in Germany, the $70,000.
[01:12:14.874 --> 01:12:16.276]  There wasn't a probable cause.
[01:12:16.396 --> 01:12:22.502]  And by the way, anybody in two seconds could have gone and looked at that file and known that it was for a house, that it was an escrow agent.
[01:12:23.567 --> 01:12:24.147]  You would think.
[01:12:24.527 --> 01:12:25.088]  You would think.
[01:12:25.668 --> 01:12:31.991]  Nonetheless, nonetheless, they were able to obtain this warrant, this search warrant from this magistrate in Sacramento.
[01:12:32.511 --> 01:12:37.874]  They came in the next morning, they executed it on Wednesday, October 4th.
[01:12:38.374 --> 01:12:43.216]  Apparently, from what I understand, because again, I was not here, there were a dozen plus agents
[01:12:43.736 --> 01:12:45.758]  Swarming all over this property.
[01:12:45.878 --> 01:12:50.201]  I can only assume with dogs it was quite the sight to see from what I understand.
[01:12:50.361 --> 01:12:57.966]  And in fact didn't your security company call you and they said that when they called there was an agent on the phone.
[01:12:57.986 --> 01:12:58.567]  Tell that story.
[01:12:59.027 --> 01:13:12.677]  Oh yeah that's kind of funny because you know when I realized what might be going on I immediately checked my messages and my messages said that there was a phone call from ADT security so I immediately contacted ADT
[01:13:13.699 --> 01:13:40.838]  ADT security and I said to them what's happening and they said well we just called and when the person picked up the phone it was a man it wasn't a woman it wasn't you miss Palfrey it was a man and the man when we asked the man for your password and what he was doing in the property he could not give us your password or code and we said we are calling the police and it's at that point that the man who was agent Joe Clark I believe said don't bother we are the police.
[01:13:41.973 --> 01:13:44.506]  Now, how many different agencies were there?
[01:13:44.567 --> 01:13:45.894]  How many different federal departments?
[01:13:46.772 --> 01:13:48.653]  There were at least two that I know of.
[01:13:48.773 --> 01:13:52.596]  There were the postal inspectors and there was the IRS.
[01:13:53.176 --> 01:13:57.118]  And let me state for the record here, this is not a tax evasion case.
[01:13:57.158 --> 01:13:58.339]  This is not a tax case.
[01:13:58.379 --> 01:14:03.022]  I'm not being charged with tax evasion or any sort of tax violation.
[01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:05.743]  I paid my taxes every March, April.
[01:14:06.884 --> 01:14:08.845]  Never once audited, never once questioned.
[01:14:08.865 --> 01:14:12.287]  Well, they have some of the most unconstitutional powers, so they're regularly used.
[01:14:12.888 --> 01:14:14.028]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:14.809]  That's correct.
[01:14:16.232 --> 01:14:19.436]  No, they've set the precedent to basically ignore the Bill of Rights, so where did it go from there?
[01:14:20.777 --> 01:14:23.560]  Well, uh, they of course pulled the trigger.
[01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:32.891]  Uh, they froze all my property, all my assets, real estate, bank accounts, retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, they took, they wiped me out.
[01:14:33.413 --> 01:14:34.955]  They left me basically indigent.
[01:14:36.116 --> 01:14:39.220]  At this point in time, I get back to the United States.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.804]  Long story short, I get back to the United States about a week later as scheduled.
[01:14:43.205 --> 01:14:44.727]  I had no idea what was going on.
[01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:49.533]  I thought when I actually landed at Dulles, of all places, in Washington, D.C.
[01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:53.057]  to clear customs, I was going to be arrested and taken into custody.
[01:14:53.457 --> 01:14:56.640]  At this point in time, it was only my property which had been arrested.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:01.684]  Nonetheless, I got back to the United States, was able to hire an attorney within a week or so.
[01:15:01.724 --> 01:15:04.807]  Mr. Sibley, I'm sure you've seen and heard of him in the news.
[01:15:06.148 --> 01:15:07.429]  He came to my rescue.
[01:15:07.449 --> 01:15:10.292]  He's one of the leading civil asset forfeiture attorneys in the country.
[01:15:10.312 --> 01:15:12.073]  He explained to me what I was being charged with.
[01:15:12.113 --> 01:15:12.894]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:15:12.914 --> 01:15:14.275]  I couldn't believe the government could do
[01:15:14.956 --> 01:15:22.491]  Let's make this clear though, they grab everything you've got so you can't even defend yourself before you've ever even been in a court of law facing a jury.
[01:15:22.832 --> 01:15:26.379]  So they take everything you've got first, guilty until proven innocent.
[01:15:26.986 --> 01:15:27.907]  Oh, that's absolutely right.
[01:15:27.927 --> 01:15:45.585]  And if you have any money left over, most attorneys, almost all attorneys, and this is why I think Mr. Sibley is just an angel who came to my rescue, most attorneys will not touch your case because if you ultimately lose, the government can take back that money from the attorney who you gave it to.
[01:15:45.705 --> 01:15:49.689]  So if they missed anything, and you give an attorney the missed money,
[01:15:50.409 --> 01:15:54.670]  Uh, the attorney may have to ultimately forfeit that if the case is lost.
[01:15:54.770 --> 01:16:02.393]  Now, by the way, the way this works is it started with British law and admiralty being able to seize enemy ships or other neutral ships aiding the enemy.
[01:16:02.413 --> 01:16:03.633]  Absolutely right.
[01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:04.753]  Then they brought it here.
[01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:06.474]  It's not constitutional.
[01:16:06.794 --> 01:16:07.614]  They just do it.
[01:16:08.195 --> 01:16:08.855]  They just do it.
[01:16:09.215 --> 01:16:11.596]  And it's getting worse and worse and worse.
[01:16:11.636 --> 01:16:12.236]  Go ahead, please.
[01:16:12.256 --> 01:16:15.157]  So, I hired Mr. Sibley.
[01:16:15.377 --> 01:16:16.277]  He comes to my rescue.
[01:16:19.224 --> 01:16:20.605]  I don't understand what's going on.
[01:16:20.905 --> 01:16:22.046]  He tries to get discovery.
[01:16:22.066 --> 01:16:23.908]  He tries to get the government to talk to him.
[01:16:24.248 --> 01:16:25.489]  The government won't speak to him.
[01:16:25.509 --> 01:16:26.970]  The government won't give him discovery.
[01:16:27.011 --> 01:16:29.493]  The government even stood him up for an appointment.
[01:16:30.433 --> 01:16:34.737]  One of the first things he says to me is, Gene, I've been in this business for 25 years.
[01:16:34.817 --> 01:16:36.679]  I'm an expert in civil asset forfeiture.
[01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:38.140]  I have never seen a case like this.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:46.447]  He said, usually the government is so anxious to tell you what they've got against the client, they practically throw it in your face.
[01:16:47.128 --> 01:16:50.471]  Here, they won't tell me anything, they won't speak to me, they won't do anything.
[01:16:51.111 --> 01:16:56.335]  We go back and forth, back and forth, trying to get them to talk to us, trying to submit motions to the court.
[01:16:56.715 --> 01:16:58.937]  We go through this process for five months.
[01:16:59.317 --> 01:17:03.580]  It's getting more and more profound as the weeks and months are going by.
[01:17:03.741 --> 01:17:09.345]  Finally, the government seeing that we are not going to bend, and I am not going to deal in any way, shape, or form.
[01:17:09.665 --> 01:17:12.167]  Because we're going to the government saying, look, what is it that you want?
[01:17:12.367 --> 01:17:13.728]  Do you want her to be queen for the day?
[01:17:13.988 --> 01:17:16.590]  Does she have some sort of information that you need?
[01:17:16.951 --> 01:17:19.413]  Say, uh, something about terrorism?
[01:17:19.433 --> 01:17:21.314]  Maybe terrorists who might have used her service?
[01:17:21.354 --> 01:17:22.095]  She'll come forward.
[01:17:22.115 --> 01:17:24.136]  You don't have to do this, uh, to her.
[01:17:24.176 --> 01:17:26.258]  She'll come forward of her own free will and volition.
[01:17:26.838 --> 01:17:29.460]  But the government wouldn't take our offers.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:30.721]  We came to them three times.
[01:17:30.781 --> 01:17:34.404]  We came to them, we went to them in late October, early November.
[01:17:34.444 --> 01:17:36.186]  We went back to them in mid-January.
[01:17:36.226 --> 01:17:37.006]  Well, to break this down, folks.
[01:17:37.166 --> 01:17:38.007]  And then in February.
[01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:38.387]  Sure.
[01:17:40.243 --> 01:17:45.327]  Uh, your main line topless bars are basically, you know, their real business.
[01:17:45.388 --> 01:17:48.370]  Most of them is prostitution, but the owners aren't even involved in it.
[01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:49.231]  They've got the girls.
[01:17:49.271 --> 01:17:52.814]  The girls are there because if they want to, they can go sleep with somebody for money.
[01:17:53.254 --> 01:17:56.637]  And I mean, is that a fair way of boiling down really what these escort services are as well?
[01:17:58.545 --> 01:18:00.466]  Uh, no, I wouldn't necessarily say that.
[01:18:00.806 --> 01:18:09.251]  But what I would say to the question of here is, it doesn't even matter if prostitution is legal or illegal.
[01:18:09.271 --> 01:18:12.173]  Because the feds are involved, that's not even their purview, why does this happen?
[01:18:12.853 --> 01:18:13.373]  Exactly.
[01:18:13.433 --> 01:18:15.434]  I mean, this is not even of relevance.
[01:18:15.915 --> 01:18:17.996]  This is almost a smoke and mirrors game.
[01:18:18.636 --> 01:18:19.197]  No, I understand.
[01:18:19.217 --> 01:18:19.957]  So that's my question.
[01:18:20.057 --> 01:18:22.218]  Why are they so interested in you?
[01:18:22.358 --> 01:18:24.740]  Why did they do this?
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.441]  It's a riddle, but I think we can unravel it.
[01:18:27.481 --> 01:18:28.262]  Stay there, Jean.
[01:18:28.282 --> 01:18:38.428]  On the other side, I want to continue to go through this with you, and I want to talk about why you've gone public, why you've released the phone numbers, and where you think this is going in the future.
[01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:40.649]  We'll also open the phones up for our guests.
[01:18:40.689 --> 01:18:44.732]  We've got a link up to our website as well, at infowars.com.
[01:18:44.832 --> 01:18:45.292]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.743 --> 01:18:58.267]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:58.607 --> 01:19:02.711]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:02.991 --> 01:19:03.552]  We listened.
[01:19:03.852 --> 01:19:08.836]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:09.097 --> 01:19:09.597]  We listened.
[01:19:09.977 --> 01:19:13.020]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:13.961]  We listened.
[01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:18.484]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:19:18.864 --> 01:19:19.344]  We listened.
[01:19:19.704 --> 01:19:24.947]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:19:25.348 --> 01:19:26.708]  Again, we listened.
[01:19:27.069 --> 01:19:28.649]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:34.393]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:37.496]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[01:19:37.696 --> 01:19:37.896]  Only $279.
[01:19:37.956 --> 01:19:38.537]  Call New Millennium, 888-03-4438.
[01:19:38.577 --> 01:19:38.817]  That's 888-03-4438.

[01:19:40.519 --> 01:19:41.480]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:56.518]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:56.919 --> 01:20:02.345]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:02.825 --> 01:20:03.906]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:20:03.926 --> 01:20:07.931]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:08.611 --> 01:20:21.957]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:21.977 --> 01:20:27.740]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:33.923]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:44.032]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.735 --> 01:20:55.237]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:55.897 --> 01:21:04.502]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[01:21:05.462 --> 01:21:10.405]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[01:21:11.485 --> 01:21:13.306]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:21:13.686 --> 01:21:14.467]  There may be more.
[01:21:15.652 --> 01:21:22.458]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[01:21:23.138 --> 01:21:30.985]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:31.825 --> 01:21:33.386]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:33.406 --> 01:21:33.747]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:45.865 --> 01:21:46.465]  Call now.
[01:21:46.666 --> 01:21:49.407]  Our operators are standing by to take your order.
[01:21:52.289 --> 01:21:54.691]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:21:55.211 --> 01:21:56.692]  After a pedicure, they look great.
[01:21:57.032 --> 01:22:00.875]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:22:01.315 --> 01:22:03.497]  Haven't you heard about Kalex ointment?
[01:22:03.937 --> 01:22:07.279]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:22:07.679 --> 01:22:10.141]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:22:10.641 --> 01:22:11.682]  What's that name again?
[01:22:12.082 --> 01:22:13.263]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:22:13.643 --> 01:22:14.624]  It's Kalex.
[01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:19.254]  C-A-L-L-E-X What makes Calex Oitman so different?
[01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:28.646]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:22:29.086 --> 01:22:34.789]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:46.313]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:22:46.969 --> 01:22:48.075]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[01:22:48.416 --> 01:22:49.079]  I'll be right back.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:50.908]  I'm getting some callux for my heels.
[01:23:04.086 --> 01:23:10.932]  Alright, so we've got the neocon government, the liberal government, they're all the same.
[01:23:13.894 --> 01:23:19.559]  Just mainline hookers are more common than water fountains as they've said in Washington D.C.
[01:23:19.579 --> 01:23:22.361]  and across the country, especially with the elites.
[01:23:23.142 --> 01:23:25.744]  I mean, it's come out about the CIA director, remember?
[01:23:26.508 --> 01:23:29.111]  Gosh, up there at the Watergate with a whole floor.
[01:23:29.231 --> 01:23:33.114]  One floor was the women, the next floor was the gambling and the booze and the drugs.
[01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:40.901]  I mean, what Deborah Jean Palfrey was doing paled in significance.
[01:23:41.301 --> 01:23:43.984]  So why the bizarre activities here?
[01:23:44.004 --> 01:23:48.548]  And I have to tell you, and I'm not sure of this, but probability-wise, it fits the MO.
[01:23:49.598 --> 01:24:01.446]  Some intelligence group, some substratum, there's a bunch of different mafias that all are within the system, kind of nexus at the top though, that are using this as a massive fleshing exercise.
[01:24:01.486 --> 01:24:08.971]  I think probably arresting her with some shot across, or going after her, seizing her assets with some shot across the bow at somebody.
[01:24:09.431 --> 01:24:11.333]  And now it looks like it's gotten out of control.
[01:24:11.873 --> 01:24:15.115]  And sometimes it's the smallest bungles that bring systems down.
[01:24:15.135 --> 01:24:16.716]  This could be like the Watergate burglary.
[01:24:17.197 --> 01:24:19.018]  It could have just been some overzealous
[01:24:20.465 --> 01:24:25.890]  Government agents, postal inspectors wanting a terrorism collar and bumping into the big DC madam.
[01:24:27.231 --> 01:24:28.532]  We've got links up to her website.
[01:24:28.552 --> 01:24:33.396]  We can learn more, see the phone numbers and also try to help her in her defense.
[01:24:34.396 --> 01:24:41.222]  She's certainly having her rights violated and you can do that at Deborah Jean Palfrey, P-A-L-F-E.
[01:24:42.683 --> 01:24:47.607]  That's Deborah Jean Palfrey, P-A-L-F-R-E-Y.com or just go to InfoWars.com.
[01:24:47.687 --> 01:24:49.869]  We've got a big link right there underneath her picture.
[01:24:50.598 --> 01:24:51.099]  I don't think so.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.761]  I'll make you have an accident.
[01:25:09.361 --> 01:25:17.187]  Now, in the words of Jennifer Flowers, Bill Clinton's girlfriend or bimbo, you know, she went on Larry King Live and hardball and said that they're killing people.
[01:25:17.227 --> 01:25:18.248]  And they said, why are you saying that?
[01:25:18.268 --> 01:25:18.769]  They'll kill you.
[01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:20.630]  And she said, no, I'm going public.
[01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:22.151]  I'm putting all my cards on the table.
[01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:25.894]  That protects me, which in my experience, it actually is the safer course.
[01:25:25.914 --> 01:25:28.236]  But let me ask you, why did you decide to go public?
[01:25:29.773 --> 01:25:32.034]  Well, I decided to go public for two reasons.
[01:25:32.154 --> 01:25:38.975]  One, the hypocrisy aspect, and that's been played out with Senator Vitter and certainly was played out with Randall Tobias a couple of months ago.
[01:25:39.516 --> 01:25:51.419]  And for all the very things that you are alleging right now, you are saying everything that my attorney and I and others behind the scenes have been saying for quite a while now.
[01:25:52.279 --> 01:25:55.960]  The two reasons, the hypocrisy and the susceptibility to blackmail.
[01:25:57.981 --> 01:26:02.667]  I mean you could be blackmailed forever and then there's all these powerful people that are afraid of what info is coming out.
[01:26:02.707 --> 01:26:05.710]  You're the only one that can really confirm if that number was accurate.
[01:26:06.151 --> 01:26:07.172]  You had to go public.
[01:26:08.693 --> 01:26:09.935]  In some respects I did.
[01:26:09.955 --> 01:26:13.259]  I have not feared for my life.
[01:26:14.667 --> 01:26:19.309]  I feel that I'm being protected somehow, some way here, either by God or by somebody.
[01:26:20.529 --> 01:26:25.851]  Thus far, I'm fine, but you're absolutely right, by putting the numbers out there, that's it.
[01:26:26.492 --> 01:26:30.393]  There's nothing more that they could have, take from me or get from me.
[01:26:31.713 --> 01:26:35.695]  Did you ever see any evidence that somebody high up was trying to get the pressure off of you?
[01:26:36.955 --> 01:26:38.636]  No, nobody has come to my rescue.
[01:26:38.916 --> 01:26:39.817]  Absolutely no one.
[01:26:40.117 --> 01:26:43.458]  So they use the service, but then they're more than happy to flush you down the toilet?
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.241]  It seems that way.
[01:26:46.903 --> 01:26:47.924]  It sure seems that way.
[01:26:48.004 --> 01:26:56.332]  I had 10,000 or so clients who, it's estimated, use my service, and 133 or so women who apparently worked for me over the years.
[01:26:56.772 --> 01:27:01.998]  Not one, except for a gal who worked for me in the mid-90s, has come forward to say, I want to help you.
[01:27:02.158 --> 01:27:04.240]  Now why don't they arrest Fox News reporter
[01:27:06.666 --> 01:27:09.368]  Why don't they, Jeff Gannon, why don't they go get him?
[01:27:09.388 --> 01:27:20.156]  I mean, he was bringing male prostitutes in, he does gay video, he was running a string of horses under him.
[01:27:20.937 --> 01:27:22.738]  Why haven't they arrested the Fox News reporter?
[01:27:23.291 --> 01:27:36.500]  Well, you know, why haven't they arrested the hundreds and hundreds of other escort services that have been in operation all along, from the onset of my debacle last October until now, and all the ones that were in operation prior to this?
[01:27:36.941 --> 01:27:39.022]  You know, they haven't gone after anyone but me.
[01:27:39.903 --> 01:27:49.349]  They haven't gone after the clients, they haven't gone after the girls, and they haven't gone after the hundreds of other agencies, services, businesses, independents in the Washington and D.C.
[01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:50.230]  Baltimore areas.
[01:27:51.912 --> 01:27:52.653]  Here's the question.
[01:27:52.974 --> 01:28:01.828]  I mean, I know you ran women, but it just seems from my study and what we keep seeing pop up that Republicans tend to be more on the gay side than Democrats.
[01:28:04.351 --> 01:28:05.552]  I don't know about that.
[01:28:05.832 --> 01:28:09.194]  I seem to think that as well by reading news reports.
[01:28:09.775 --> 01:28:13.637]  But my agency was strictly a heterosexual agency.
[01:28:14.018 --> 01:28:15.058]  Women for men.
[01:28:15.278 --> 01:28:16.299]  Well, that may be the problem.
[01:28:16.479 --> 01:28:19.241]  That probably upsets some people high up in the administration.
[01:28:19.261 --> 01:28:21.262]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:28:21.302 --> 01:28:23.003]  Maybe you weren't providing what they liked.
[01:28:23.023 --> 01:28:23.844]  Alright, I'm gonna...
[01:28:24.504 --> 01:28:25.645]  That's just unbelievable.
[01:28:26.065 --> 01:28:27.786]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:27.866 --> 01:28:33.349]  On the other side, the lady who's got a lot of courage, whether she knows it or not, she's Jean Palfrey.
[01:28:33.789 --> 01:28:36.631]  And you can simply go to Infowars.com and link to her site.
[01:28:36.891 --> 01:28:40.553]  Stay with us for lots of other key questions and answers straight ahead in your phone calls.
[01:28:42.254 --> 01:28:43.175]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.655 --> 01:28:45.256]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.176 --> 01:28:48.858]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.734 --> 01:28:54.455]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:28:54.615 --> 01:28:55.896]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:28:56.096 --> 01:28:58.938]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:28:59.298 --> 01:29:02.060]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:29:02.601 --> 01:29:09.345]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:29:09.885 --> 01:29:17.551]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.
[01:29:18.491 --> 01:29:19.112]  We're good to go.
[01:29:33.302 --> 01:29:33.502]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:29:33.562 --> 01:29:36.184]  That's 877-873-9626 and express your freedom of speech today!
[01:29:36.244 --> 01:29:36.904]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:29:36.924 --> 01:29:37.184]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:29:51.809 --> 01:29:54.531]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:29:54.971 --> 01:30:00.634]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:30:01.135 --> 01:30:03.276]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:30:03.436 --> 01:30:12.661]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:30:12.961 --> 01:30:17.184]  With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the helping hand it needs
[01:30:17.524 --> 01:30:17.764]  I think so.
[01:30:34.794 --> 01:30:40.376]  To order Live 52 and for the best source of research herbal products visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[01:30:40.396 --> 01:30:42.557]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:42.577 --> 01:30:43.498]  Each night when you sleep
[01:30:54.898 --> 01:30:59.280]  Your body uses the time to restore itself so that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.201]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[01:31:02.661 --> 01:31:10.405]  Now there's NightSkin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[01:31:10.925 --> 01:31:17.488]  NightSkin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[01:31:17.968 --> 01:31:23.192]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage.
[01:31:23.873 --> 01:31:25.474]  All while you get a good night's sleep.
[01:31:25.914 --> 01:31:31.158]  Try NightSkin today and see what it's like to wake up feeling renewed both inside and out.
[01:31:31.518 --> 01:31:33.800]  Try NightSkin risk-free by calling 1-800-894-3418.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:39.184]  NightSkin is guaranteed to renew your skin overnight.
[01:31:39.464 --> 01:31:41.686]  Turning back the clock has never been this easy.
[01:31:42.046 --> 01:31:43.988]  Try NightSkin risk-free today.
[01:31:44.388 --> 01:31:44.748]  Call 1-800-894-3418.
[01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.970]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[01:31:48.010 --> 01:32:03.173]  Our guest has agreed to stay with us for about 20 minutes into the next hours.
[01:32:03.193 --> 01:32:04.714]  We have more time to take your calls.
[01:32:04.734 --> 01:32:07.314]  Your calls are coming up in about 10-15 minutes.
[01:32:07.574 --> 01:32:15.576]  Specifically on the DC Madam case and just overall espionage using sex as their main mode.
[01:32:16.434 --> 01:32:24.019]  But I tell you, the stuff going on here is extremely tame compared to what's going on right now at Bohemian Grove in Northern California.
[01:32:24.059 --> 01:32:31.084]  So it's a mystery as to why this all happened, but it has the marks of espionage and blackmail all over it.
[01:32:32.825 --> 01:32:39.710]  Now, before we go back to our guest, I want to tell all the listeners about Horrible Foods.
[01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:42.752]  Now, it's not that you're living in fear that you do this.
[01:32:42.792 --> 01:32:44.493]  You do this because you're in charge.
[01:32:44.593 --> 01:32:45.614]  You're taking control of your life.
[01:32:46.677 --> 01:32:50.680]  I have three separate purchases of food I've made in the last eight, nine years.
[01:32:51.301 --> 01:32:53.782]  One of them is only a few months old, the other is about eight years old.
[01:32:54.603 --> 01:32:55.804]  They last more than ten years.
[01:32:56.384 --> 01:32:57.445]  High quality, storable foods.
[01:32:57.465 --> 01:33:03.569]  If there's a hurricane or a depression or a breakdown of society, all the things we hear about, I can eat my investment.
[01:33:03.809 --> 01:33:04.170]  In fact,
[01:33:05.473 --> 01:33:06.294]  I don't know.
[01:33:22.615 --> 01:33:24.676]  And I certainly hope that you'll give them a call.
[01:33:24.716 --> 01:33:25.816]  I mean, look at the Superdome.
[01:33:25.856 --> 01:33:26.897]  Look at what happened in New Orleans.
[01:33:27.317 --> 01:33:31.278]  If you don't have food, the government can bring in total control over you and your family.
[01:33:31.558 --> 01:33:33.819]  And they're openly talking about using food as a weapon.
[01:33:34.019 --> 01:33:36.660]  They're talking about really cracking down on this country.
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:37.560]  I hope it doesn't happen.
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:39.541]  The point is, if it does, I'm ready.
[01:33:40.101 --> 01:33:41.362]  And you need to give them a call.
[01:33:41.422 --> 01:33:43.763]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:33:43.783 --> 01:33:47.084]  You'll never have to turn your guns in to get food if you have the affordable foods.
[01:33:47.865 --> 01:33:57.427]  And it's 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:33:57.527 --> 01:34:00.908]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633.
[01:34:00.928 --> 01:34:06.649]  And you can call up, get a catalog, food samples, things like that.
[01:34:06.689 --> 01:34:07.509]  It's so important.
[01:34:07.989 --> 01:34:11.750]  Also, it's just going crazy at the bookstore right now at infowars.com.
[01:34:13.661 --> 01:34:15.642]  And I'm glad, because we need to get this information out.
[01:34:15.762 --> 01:34:19.404]  The late, great USA, the coming merger with Mexico and Canada.
[01:34:19.744 --> 01:34:21.185]  We have it for $19.95.
[01:34:21.765 --> 01:34:23.346]  I heard it being sold on the radio this morning for $28.
[01:34:23.666 --> 01:34:26.327]  It's $26 in stores.
[01:34:26.347 --> 01:34:29.068]  $19.95 at Infowars.com.
[01:34:29.889 --> 01:34:34.431]  The late, great USA, the coming merger with Mexico and Canada.
[01:34:34.851 --> 01:34:38.633]  The European Union was put into place incrementally over 50 years, and now
[01:34:40.602 --> 01:34:44.904]  It's happening here with a North American Union, not by the citizens of the member states.
[01:34:44.924 --> 01:34:49.966]  It's being done by stealth, and Dr. Jerome Corsi's done a fabulous job putting all this together.
[01:34:50.006 --> 01:34:57.529]  The late, great USA, the coming merger with Mexico and Canada, available at a discounted price, out of the gates, at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:57.889 --> 01:35:00.591]  Also, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:35:00.891 --> 01:35:03.932]  Final cut, the special edition I put out one year after the first release.
[01:35:04.512 --> 01:35:06.154]  It's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:06.214 --> 01:35:08.015]  And now shipping, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:08.435 --> 01:35:11.318]  Now shipping, and your orders are going out within 24 hours.
[01:35:11.438 --> 01:35:13.079]  We've got a great shipping department here.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.600]  TerrorStorm, now available.
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.821]  Loose Change, second edition.
[01:35:16.142 --> 01:35:19.524]  America, Freedom to Fascism, discounted massively.
[01:35:20.005 --> 01:35:23.568]  All at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:35:23.588 --> 01:35:31.274]  Alright, Paul and Texas and many others, we're going to get to your calls in a few minutes, but I want to go back to our guests.
[01:35:32.363 --> 01:35:38.685]  Jean, any other facets or areas I haven't brought up or important points or parts of the story that people should know about?
[01:35:39.685 --> 01:35:40.546]  Oh, well, there are many.
[01:35:41.446 --> 01:35:50.249]  But I think you're hitting on the main aspects here of how truly twisted and puzzling and bizarre this situation is.
[01:35:50.549 --> 01:35:52.749]  This is not a case about prostitution.
[01:35:52.789 --> 01:35:55.170]  It never was, it isn't now, and it never will be.
[01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:57.631]  There's something very rotten at the core of all this.
[01:35:58.051 --> 01:35:59.852]  And yes, there is something that comes to mind.
[01:36:00.472 --> 01:36:00.792]  Why
[01:36:01.801 --> 01:36:04.382]  Hasn't this case really come to light?
[01:36:04.802 --> 01:36:07.243]  And it still hasn't come to light, even as we speak.
[01:36:07.703 --> 01:36:10.524]  The mainstream media pays no attention to this.
[01:36:10.984 --> 01:36:17.987]  My attorney, Mr. Sibley, my civil attorney, Mr. Sibley and I have persisted for months and months and months trying to get this story out.
[01:36:18.427 --> 01:36:21.048]  Nobody wants to listen to us in the mainstream media.
[01:36:21.688 --> 01:36:30.591]  Interestingly, when we put the records out for availability the other week, the Washington Post nor the New York Times came to us.
[01:36:31.090 --> 01:36:36.095]  Very few of the main media outlets or the press came to us.
[01:36:36.155 --> 01:36:40.198]  That's because half of them use similar services, and that's what's so hypocritical.
[01:36:40.218 --> 01:36:47.124]  They'll stand by while you just ran an escort service, and again, we're not debating the moral things here, folks.
[01:36:47.144 --> 01:36:48.986]  We're just putting it out there.
[01:36:49.326 --> 01:36:54.831]  They can all use you, and they can all be involved, and then they're not going to say a word while you're being ruined.
[01:36:55.762 --> 01:37:07.644]  I don't understand why they are not coming forward, because we keep telling them that there is more to this story than prostitution, that this is a very peculiar situation that involves constitutional and civil rights abuses.
[01:37:09.554 --> 01:37:10.816]  They just don't seem to be interested.
[01:37:10.856 --> 01:37:16.362]  Well, I mean, they're bought and paid for by the same military industrial complex that runs brothels right there at the Watergate right now, 24-7.
[01:37:16.382 --> 01:37:21.408]  So, I mean, we know why they're not doing this, and they know it goes all the way to the top.
[01:37:21.789 --> 01:37:26.114]  The question is, why did they initiate this and force you to then defend yourself?
[01:37:26.654 --> 01:37:36.006]  Well, you know, your point a little while ago about how this should never have come out, that this was something bungled, like the Watergate burglary was bungled years ago.
[01:37:36.026 --> 01:37:41.313]  And if it wasn't for the bungled burglary, perhaps Watergate never would have surfaced.
[01:37:41.753 --> 01:38:03.260]  This may be a very similar situation, that I still contend, and I will continue to contend forever, most likely, that Joe and Maria came out here only on a fishing expedition, and when they couldn't gain access to my property, because I was in Germany, the realtor couldn't let them in, that's when they made, I believe, the fatal mistake when they went up to Sacramento and got the search warrant.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:07.641]  And how they got the search warrant based upon information three to five years old, I have no idea.
[01:38:09.353 --> 01:38:15.675]  It's amazing, and I know you're not here talking about names or ratting out.
[01:38:16.115 --> 01:38:19.876]  You're just putting out the phone numbers that were brought into the court case.
[01:38:20.757 --> 01:38:29.339]  But I mean, how high, or any other little tidbits you can give us you haven't yet talked about, how high does this go or any other facets?
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:32.380]  Well, you know, I don't know how high it goes.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:38.282]  I'm learning more about my clients through the media than I probably knew about them during the 13 years that I actually knew them.
[01:38:38.929 --> 01:38:42.533]  Uh, but we now know it goes as high as at least a United States Senator.
[01:38:42.953 --> 01:38:51.601]  I'm hearing rumors of similar from other people, that there are other possibilities in that stratosphere, so to speak, on that level.
[01:38:51.621 --> 01:38:53.122]  I don't know.
[01:38:53.142 --> 01:38:55.725]  I do know that there are a tremendous amount of lobbyists
[01:38:56.226 --> 01:39:07.649]  There are all sorts of people I think here who, and I estimate anywhere between a couple of dozen to a hundred or so people, who will be noteworthy individuals exposed before this is all over.
[01:39:08.069 --> 01:39:12.851]  But most of these people are sort of like Harlan Ullman or Randall Tobias.
[01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:17.632]  Harlan Ullman was Mr. Shock and Awe and Randall Tobias was the former Deputy Secretary of State.
[01:39:18.132 --> 01:39:19.392]  Not household names.
[01:39:19.712 --> 01:39:20.453]  Not household names.
[01:39:20.733 --> 01:39:22.933]  But the people who are really the movers and shakers.
[01:39:23.093 --> 01:39:26.834]  Yeah, the actual technocrats that are really pulling the strings, setting the policy.
[01:39:27.154 --> 01:39:27.694]  That's right.
[01:39:27.754 --> 01:39:30.975]  And I anticipate anywhere between a few dozen to a hundred or so.
[01:39:31.315 --> 01:39:33.615]  Are there going to be some big names that come out of this?
[01:39:34.555 --> 01:39:35.216]  I wouldn't doubt it.
[01:39:35.376 --> 01:39:36.376]  I really wouldn't doubt it.
[01:39:36.576 --> 01:39:44.817]  You know, we also have, you know, off to the side here, we have Mr. Larry Flint, who has his own little operation going on.
[01:39:45.158 --> 01:39:47.198]  He's trying to out various hypocrites.
[01:39:48.059 --> 01:39:51.976]  He is not connected to me except through a mutual acquaintance.
[01:39:52.515 --> 01:39:56.538]  Other than that, Mr. Flint is off doing more or less his own thing here.
[01:39:57.079 --> 01:40:09.769]  And he claims, according to his statement on Larry Flint the other night, he claims that there are approximately 30 or so individuals who he is going to be bringing forward.
[01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:15.133]  This is coming from that Washington Post ad that he put out all about a month and a half or so ago.
[01:40:15.994 --> 01:40:20.317]  He started with 300 solid leads, and he is down to about 30 or so.
[01:40:21.539 --> 01:40:26.705]  Well, I've known a lot of young women.
[01:40:26.725 --> 01:40:30.950]  I grew up around in Dallas and Austin, Texas, who moved to D.C.
[01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:35.956]  or ended up in D.C., and they said they were propositioned repeatedly to join, you know, these things.
[01:40:35.976 --> 01:40:37.178]  It's such a big industry.
[01:40:37.828 --> 01:40:39.510]  There is.
[01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:47.400]  I mean, what is it about Washington that they seem to have, you know, kind of like New Orleans is known for this as well, but also, you know, the biggest consumers of alcohol.
[01:40:47.861 --> 01:40:52.767]  Why is it, why does he see such a big consumer of the sex trade?
[01:40:53.573 --> 01:40:55.515]  Well, you know, I don't know if it is or if it isn't.
[01:40:56.676 --> 01:41:01.121]  I don't know if it's any different from Atlanta or any other city or town in this country.
[01:41:01.521 --> 01:41:03.683]  Although, perhaps it might be because of power.
[01:41:03.943 --> 01:41:06.566]  You know, because of the power, because there is the money there.
[01:41:08.048 --> 01:41:10.550]  You know, Randall Tobias, you know, the arrogance also.
[01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:14.194]  He made the statement, ordering an escort is like ordering a pizza.
[01:41:14.274 --> 01:41:15.215]  It's no more difficult.
[01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:19.195]  I mean, there's a certain amount of arrogance and power with some of these folks.
[01:41:19.655 --> 01:41:26.465]  So maybe there's a point that it may be a more active city in this regard.
[01:41:27.967 --> 01:41:29.549]  Well, obviously, I think you hit the nail on the head.
[01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:30.250]  It's the money.
[01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:31.612]  It's the power.
[01:41:33.725 --> 01:41:35.147]  Where does it go from here?
[01:41:35.567 --> 01:41:38.890]  I mean, what are you hoping to see resolved?
[01:41:39.110 --> 01:41:42.273]  I mean, in a perfect world, how would things remedy themselves?
[01:41:42.454 --> 01:41:43.775]  Well, I have an excellent case.
[01:41:43.855 --> 01:41:47.438]  You know, I really have an excellent case on so many levels and in so many ways.
[01:41:47.598 --> 01:41:50.141]  And I have numerous motions before the court right now.
[01:41:50.681 --> 01:41:53.644]  Uh, any one of which could kill this case quickly.
[01:41:54.125 --> 01:41:57.728]  It's before, all these motions are before Judge Glass Kessler.
[01:41:57.788 --> 01:42:01.271]  Judge Kessler is a 70-ish year old woman about to retire.
[01:42:01.291 --> 01:42:08.958]  She's the protege of Sandra Day O'Connor, Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Ginsburg, Justice Ginsburg.
[01:42:09.579 --> 01:42:11.020]  She comes from that old school.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.362]  She's a Clinton appointee.
[01:42:13.242 --> 01:42:17.965]  I mean, what's the dollar amount on the assets they've stolen from you?
[01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:43.622]  About a million and a half, perhaps a little bit more, a million and three quarters depending upon market value.
[01:42:44.724 --> 01:42:47.350]  So we're talking a million and a half plus here.
[01:42:47.751 --> 01:42:49.013]  How's your legal defense fund going?
[01:42:50.316 --> 01:42:52.417]  Well, I'm not accepting any money from that.
[01:42:52.697 --> 01:42:57.719]  We're redoing the site as we speak, and we're taking the legal defense part off of there.
[01:42:57.739 --> 01:43:10.924]  I took some monies for the first month or so, and after taking some $5 and $10 donations from people who you knew, who I knew, $5 and $10 meant a lot to, I just decided, you know, I can't do this in good conscience.
[01:43:11.593 --> 01:43:20.240]  However, the court has appointed, because I am an indigent person, the court has appointed a first-rate attorney to me, Preston Burton, a criminal attorney.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:24.544]  He represented Monica Lewinsky during the Bill Clinton impeachment.
[01:43:24.904 --> 01:43:34.492]  He also represented Robert Hanson, the fellow, the FBI bad actor, the recent movie, Breach, and he also represented Aldrich James back in the 90s.
[01:43:35.305 --> 01:43:38.767]  So, this woman has been very, very good to me, Judge Kessler.
[01:43:39.067 --> 01:43:42.968]  She's appointed... Sounds like she's appointed you a pretty high-powered... She sure did.
[01:43:43.069 --> 01:43:54.314]  She appointed about as good an attorney as I could get to get me, I hope, get me the representation that I need to give her, I hope, the tools that she needs to help us all get out of this.
[01:43:54.334 --> 01:43:56.475]  Well, sounds like that lawyer's got some big connections.
[01:43:56.515 --> 01:43:59.416]  You're going to find out real quick if the establishment wants this to go away.
[01:44:01.559 --> 01:44:06.381]  I think that Judge Kessler, more than anything, is a very fair woman.
[01:44:06.942 --> 01:44:12.604]  Again, she did lift the injunction on the court record, or on the phone record, but that was a big statement right then and there.
[01:44:13.204 --> 01:44:17.866]  And Mr. Burton has written some fabulous legal motions.
[01:44:17.946 --> 01:44:18.746]  Have you been in court?
[01:44:18.766 --> 01:44:22.368]  Have you seen these different government federal agents?
[01:44:22.388 --> 01:44:23.388]  Have you talked to them?
[01:44:23.488 --> 01:44:24.949]  Oh yeah, oh sure, sure.
[01:44:25.089 --> 01:44:26.910]  I've put faces to names.
[01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:31.973]  A long ago, and they're all about 30 years of age, give or take.
[01:44:31.993 --> 01:44:35.895]  Now, they got a huge crop of really young agents out there, don't they?
[01:44:36.135 --> 01:44:50.583]  They sure do, they sure do, and that's what amazed me, because when I kept seeing these names, Troy Burroughs from the IRS, and Maria Kubion from the Postal Inspector's Office, I mean, I was imagining in my mind 35, 40 plus year old men and women.
[01:44:52.083 --> 01:44:54.225]  And when I met them, they were about 28 years of age.
[01:44:57.435 --> 01:44:59.836]  If they are any older, I mean, I would be floored.
[01:45:00.116 --> 01:45:01.256]  I mean, they look twenty-one.
[01:45:01.336 --> 01:45:02.576]  Well, I'm not knocking young people.
[01:45:02.636 --> 01:45:03.697]  I mean, I'm pretty young.
[01:45:03.777 --> 01:45:06.277]  I'm not either, but you don't have... you need some expertise.
[01:45:06.357 --> 01:45:08.558]  Oh, no, I agree.
[01:45:08.598 --> 01:45:16.740]  I mean, the image of an FBI agent or a high-level IRS criminal investigator is, you know, fifty-five-year-old man or woman, gray hair, real serious.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:19.340]  And, no, I've been out at events and covered things and seen it.
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:21.961]  I mean, secret service that look like babies.
[01:45:22.501 --> 01:45:23.901]  An FBI that look like babies.
[01:45:23.941 --> 01:45:26.162]  And they're literally, you know, gum-chewing,
[01:45:26.912 --> 01:45:28.613]  Almost nose-picking adolescents.
[01:45:28.913 --> 01:45:32.654]  I mean, I don't know the shift that's taken place, but it's frightening.
[01:45:33.415 --> 01:45:40.657]  It is frightening, and when I saw them, I thought, oh my God, this is why you jumped the gun and went up to Sacramento and got that search warrant.
[01:45:41.138 --> 01:45:42.998]  They made a very foolish mistake.
[01:45:43.979 --> 01:45:49.561]  Well, they're using all these anti-terror powers just in routine cases that, as you said, aren't even federal.
[01:45:50.291 --> 01:45:52.693]  That's correct and you have to think about it for just a second.
[01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:59.178]  If let's say these folks are not 28 but they're 30 or 31 and they've spent the last five or six years under this administration.
[01:45:59.518 --> 01:46:08.825]  They've been working under this administration their entire career for all intents and purposes since they got out of college or graduate school in their mid-twenties or so.
[01:46:09.185 --> 01:46:16.050]  They know no other way and of course you couple that with the arrogance and we were all 28 and 30 at one time or another.
[01:46:16.411 --> 01:46:18.312]  The arrogance of your average 28 or 30 year old with power
[01:46:20.026 --> 01:46:21.567]  My God, it's a scary thought.
[01:46:22.908 --> 01:46:27.752]  It doesn't take much to realize that you can get to the point where I'm at right now.
[01:46:28.312 --> 01:46:29.413]  Muddled mistakes.
[01:46:29.613 --> 01:46:31.434]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[01:46:31.494 --> 01:46:34.176]  David in California, you're our first caller for our guest.
[01:46:34.196 --> 01:46:34.577]  Go ahead.
[01:46:34.597 --> 01:46:37.559]  And I've been waiting to talk to you for a long time.
[01:46:38.657 --> 01:46:47.285]  Sandra Day O'Connor was talking today about those terror things and people being able to search without the warrants and what they have done to you.
[01:46:47.646 --> 01:46:53.651]  You're very brave, and I hope your lawyer gets as much publicity as he did when he was with Monica Lewinsky.
[01:46:55.733 --> 01:46:57.455]  Oh, I'm sure he is.
[01:46:57.495 --> 01:46:59.617]  But you know, Mr. Burton is a very modest man.
[01:46:59.637 --> 01:47:01.899]  Believe it or not, he shies away from the press.
[01:47:02.432 --> 01:47:06.373]  I believe, and that's probably the smarter way to do it, especially right now with the press, what they're doing.
[01:47:06.413 --> 01:47:08.354]  In fact, you see how young these kids are.
[01:47:08.754 --> 01:47:12.015]  They're easily, you can mold them that young.
[01:47:12.315 --> 01:47:16.797]  In fact, if you notice how they're doing the campaign on CNN through YouTube.
[01:47:17.677 --> 01:47:21.899]  I actually watch and talk to these kids and they treat them like little kids that don't know anything.
[01:47:22.499 --> 01:47:28.341]  They're supposed to be a man or a woman by the time you're 18 and people were 100 years ago, but now I meet a lot of 30-year-old children.
[01:47:29.108 --> 01:47:33.611]  And it's like a rest of development, but do you have a question specifically for our guest?
[01:47:35.132 --> 01:47:39.515]  Actually, I just got a question as far as how we're going to fix the whole problem.
[01:47:39.935 --> 01:47:41.596]  We need to just band together.
[01:47:41.616 --> 01:47:47.200]  I'm going through my neighborhood just in case something does happen, and they do try to implement martial law.
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:50.682]  We're going to get together, and we're going to make sure that they can't come and take us away.
[01:47:51.022 --> 01:47:52.223]  That's important, and God bless you.
[01:47:52.243 --> 01:47:54.024]  It's going to be more of an incremental martial law, I think.
[01:47:54.325 --> 01:47:56.246]  Fred in Philadelphia, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:47:56.266 --> 01:47:56.606]  Go ahead.
[01:47:56.626 --> 01:47:57.287]  What do you see, madam?
[01:48:00.154 --> 01:48:17.024]  I want to talk about the guise of terrorism or the pretext of terrorism to really have financial control and prevent basically any accumulation of capital.
[01:48:17.634 --> 01:48:27.941]  Well, Bush just signed an executive order, and I've talked to top lawyers just over the weekend, and my interpretation was correct, so was Dr. Roberts, that they can start seizing property if you protest the war.
[01:48:28.241 --> 01:48:39.168]  Now, let's see them try that, but the point is... Well, what I meant is that when your guests have the wire transfer, that apparently
[01:48:41.432 --> 01:48:45.073]  With the motivation to then move into action.
[01:48:45.253 --> 01:48:46.753]  And notice it was warrantless.
[01:48:47.353 --> 01:48:48.774]  They're just looking at everything.
[01:48:49.394 --> 01:48:50.354]  Comments on that, Jean?
[01:48:51.594 --> 01:48:58.936]  Oh yeah, there's no question that the wire transfer was the trigger because for two and a half years, 31 months prior to that, they did absolutely nothing.
[01:48:59.336 --> 01:49:02.877]  And I think when I wired the money, it was the straw that broke the camel's back.
[01:49:02.957 --> 01:49:07.998]  And they sort of panicked and wondered, what was I possibly doing out here in California?
[01:49:08.258 --> 01:49:10.559]  That's when they made the plane reservations and came out here.
[01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:12.722]  So they thought you were getting ready to leave?
[01:49:13.442 --> 01:49:15.443]  I don't know what they thought I was about to do.
[01:49:15.943 --> 01:49:17.103]  But they wanted to find out.
[01:49:17.443 --> 01:49:26.047]  I rather suspect that they wanted to get in here and pretend to be a potential buyer, talk to me, chat me up, take a look around, and figure it out for themselves.
[01:49:28.608 --> 01:49:29.048]  Amazing!
[01:49:29.108 --> 01:49:35.030]  Our borders are wide open, the dollar's being devalued, our society's falling apart,
[01:49:36.258 --> 01:49:41.642]  And there are giant teams of feds running around going after escort service honors.
[01:49:43.103 --> 01:49:45.625]  Yeah, that's what's going on in our country.
[01:49:46.386 --> 01:49:46.806]  Stay there.
[01:49:46.866 --> 01:49:47.787]  Thanks for the call, Fred.
[01:49:47.827 --> 01:49:49.008]  More calls for our guests at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:55.015 --> 01:49:58.217]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:58.557 --> 01:50:00.479]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:00.859 --> 01:50:08.504]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.184 --> 01:50:16.247]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.647 --> 01:50:28.052]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.372 --> 01:50:31.894]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.334 --> 01:50:34.295]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:34.595 --> 01:50:38.457]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:51.935 --> 01:50:57.157]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:57.297 --> 01:51:05.379]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:05.639 --> 01:51:12.701]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:12.841 --> 01:51:13.802]  We're good to go!
[01:51:40.063 --> 01:51:44.067]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:44.927 --> 01:51:46.489]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:48.370]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:56.317]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:51:56.638 --> 01:51:58.519]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.782]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:52:01.942 --> 01:52:05.085]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:52:05.385 --> 01:52:07.207]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:52:07.507 --> 01:52:07.887]  We're good.
[01:52:23.952 --> 01:52:28.274]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[01:52:28.594 --> 01:52:32.856]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[01:52:33.176 --> 01:52:39.038]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[01:52:39.358 --> 01:52:41.779]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:42.820]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.180]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[01:52:56.399 --> 01:52:57.082]  I think so.
[01:53:39.896 --> 01:53:40.557]  Welcome back!
[01:53:40.617 --> 01:53:41.678]  This world is ruled!
[01:53:41.958 --> 01:53:45.181]  Alright, Deborah Jean Palfrey is our guest.
[01:53:45.201 --> 01:53:46.241]  Goes by Jean Palfrey.
[01:53:46.301 --> 01:53:47.943]  She's a big DC madam.
[01:53:47.983 --> 01:53:49.144]  Made all these headlines and
[01:54:07.484 --> 01:54:15.450]  Again, the Fed's going after somebody for something that a large portion of the leadership publicly engages in.
[01:54:15.490 --> 01:54:21.774]  I mean, Barney Frank, ladies and gentlemen, in the late 90s was caught in Maryland running underage male prostitutes.
[01:54:22.215 --> 01:54:29.220]  We're talking hardcore felonies, stuff he should be in trouble for, out of his three-story townhouse.
[01:54:30.319 --> 01:54:32.940]  Now, now, that is serious business.
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:39.402]  But, oh, he came out here at a press conference, he said, if this doesn't drop right now, the government's going down.
[01:54:39.602 --> 01:54:45.183]  And they went, oh, because, you know, we all know about the true leadership, what they're really into.
[01:54:45.663 --> 01:54:51.865]  In fact, this list that Palfrey has would be the who's who if she ran a mail brothel.
[01:54:52.205 --> 01:54:52.725]  But it's not.
[01:54:53.946 --> 01:54:58.827]  So it's, I guess, more the functionaries that were, and some senators that were involved in this.
[01:54:59.917 --> 01:55:02.739]  But it's just off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:03.019 --> 01:55:07.742]  Now, we have a call that disagrees, and I have a rule that people who disagree go to the head of the line as long as they're nice.
[01:55:07.762 --> 01:55:12.385]  But before we go to Jeff, Mike, DJ, and many others that are holding, our guest will be with us 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:55:12.405 --> 01:55:26.393]  Gene, we were talking during the break, and you were saying that finally you're starting to get in contact with media that doesn't censor you, and you're finally now able to talk about what's really going on here and not just, you know, the watch list of who's going to be outed next.
[01:55:27.324 --> 01:55:27.745]  That's true.
[01:55:27.845 --> 01:55:31.573]  Finally the tide is turning that people are starting to ask...
[01:55:32.299 --> 01:55:33.320]  Why is this happening?
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.321]  What's going on here?
[01:55:34.421 --> 01:55:36.443]  Why is it this woman and this woman alone?
[01:55:36.944 --> 01:55:37.884]  Why no one else?
[01:55:38.325 --> 01:55:57.883]  Do you know that my Federal Public Defender, who was my criminal attorney before I was appointed, Mr. Preston Burton, told me that in his 16 years, and he is the Chief Federal Public Defender for the District of Columbia, 16 years in Washington at that office, he has never seen a case like mine, nor have any of his colleagues.
[01:55:58.965 --> 01:56:00.366]  There's something going on here.
[01:56:00.526 --> 01:56:01.847]  Well, let me just ask you in your gut.
[01:56:02.288 --> 01:56:09.373]  My gut, and by my gut, the history I've studied, and you can never be sure, tells me there's some type of black op going on here.
[01:56:09.854 --> 01:56:12.056]  You were saying your lawyers and others do believe that as well?
[01:56:12.836 --> 01:56:14.978]  Or do you think, I mean, what's the chance?
[01:56:14.998 --> 01:56:18.220]  50-50, it's a black op versus young idiots?
[01:56:18.721 --> 01:56:22.424]  Or did the young idiots do this and then trigger a black op?
[01:56:22.444 --> 01:56:23.625]  What do you think's going on?
[01:56:24.446 --> 01:56:26.527]  I think there was something going on.
[01:56:26.668 --> 01:56:30.771]  There was a very good reason why I was being watched and not touched for quite a while.
[01:56:31.332 --> 01:56:32.313]  I think they panicked.
[01:56:32.413 --> 01:56:34.555]  They came out here to find out what was going on.
[01:56:34.655 --> 01:56:37.498]  I don't think that they expected to do what they did.
[01:56:37.518 --> 01:56:42.943]  Then we had the stupidity of these young kids come in and they triggered this entire mess.
[01:56:43.945 --> 01:56:44.825]  That's what I think.
[01:56:44.865 --> 01:56:47.246]  There is something serious at the core of all of this.
[01:56:47.827 --> 01:56:54.009]  What that is, I don't know at this point in time, but something happened and something was going on behind my back with this agency.
[01:56:54.609 --> 01:56:58.731]  And when I made all these aberrant moves, selling my house, closing the business, wiring the money,
[01:56:59.191 --> 01:57:04.235]  That's when they panicked a little and came out here to find out what was going on.
[01:57:04.455 --> 01:57:06.637]  So something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[01:57:06.877 --> 01:57:07.417]  Oh, you bet.
[01:57:07.898 --> 01:57:09.419]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:57:09.479 --> 01:57:12.101]  I'm going to go directly to Jeff in Canada who disagrees with something.
[01:57:12.481 --> 01:57:22.929]  You go to the head of the line, then Mike in Rhode Island, DJ in Illinois, and many, many others, 1-800-259-9231, specifically on this subject.
[01:57:23.789 --> 01:57:27.952]  And it's a wide subject and a very important subject as we turn over the rocks.
[01:57:28.273 --> 01:57:28.713]  Stay with us.
[01:57:32.119 --> 01:57:37.229]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:58:15.733 --> 01:58:23.559]  Some economic news is taking place.
[01:58:23.619 --> 01:58:31.105]  These daily, sometimes three, four times daily, announcements on different fronts of the presidency being supposedly above the law.
[01:58:33.106 --> 01:58:37.710]  It's never before been seen, even during a civil war, the president didn't say it was above the law.
[01:58:39.551 --> 01:58:41.994]  So we are definitely in the twilight zone here.
[01:58:43.016 --> 01:58:44.217]  Jean Palfrey, the D.C.
[01:58:44.278 --> 01:58:47.362]  Madam, one of the biggest stories of the last 10 months, is our guest.
[01:58:47.382 --> 01:58:48.323]  We're honored to have her.
[01:58:49.064 --> 01:58:53.250]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Canada, who I'm told disagrees with something.
[01:58:53.290 --> 01:58:53.770]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:58:54.331 --> 01:58:54.992]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:58:55.152 --> 01:58:55.853]  Good afternoon, Jean.
[01:58:56.614 --> 01:58:57.095]  Good afternoon.
[01:58:58.418 --> 01:58:59.199]  I have two points.
[01:58:59.439 --> 01:59:00.581]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:59:01.202 --> 01:59:06.309]  The first point is, the world's going to hell in a handbasket, as we all know, and we're talking about prostitution in politics.
[01:59:06.769 --> 01:59:12.076]  These are the oldest institutions in the world.
[01:59:13.117 --> 01:59:13.937]  Hold on, let me stop you.
[01:59:14.618 --> 01:59:15.698]  We haven't made it clear here.
[01:59:15.758 --> 01:59:17.079]  That's the whole point of this.
[01:59:17.459 --> 01:59:19.239]  They have violated our constitutional rights.
[01:59:19.459 --> 01:59:20.760]  They've grabbed our assets.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.421]  They've done it through anti-terror auspices.
[01:59:23.721 --> 01:59:27.042]  This can affect anybody, whether you're running a car dealership or a restaurant.
[01:59:27.722 --> 01:59:29.283]  This stuff's going on everywhere.
[01:59:29.303 --> 01:59:33.344]  And that's the whole point, is they're a pack of hypocrites.
[01:59:35.225 --> 01:59:39.846]  This is a story, just like we do every day here, about what's happening to individuals.
[01:59:40.987 --> 01:59:41.427]  Keep going.
[01:59:41.997 --> 01:59:43.037]  Let me finish my point, please.
[01:59:43.057 --> 01:59:43.738]  Thank you very much.
[01:59:44.778 --> 01:59:49.360]  I totally disagree with you and your call that the mob shakes down businesses all the time, as do the police.
[01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:50.321]  This is no different.
[01:59:50.901 --> 01:59:52.061]  I think that Ms.
[01:59:52.081 --> 01:59:55.103]  Palfrey needs to go back to Thomas Jefferson and finish her law degree.
[01:59:55.403 --> 02:00:00.025]  I'm disturbed that you would openly recruit female students from local universities for your business.
[02:00:00.865 --> 02:00:02.586]  And you've had prior legal problems, Ms.
[02:00:02.606 --> 02:00:06.867]  Palfrey, including a restraining order from her former boyfriend in 1989 and a 1990 arrest for prostitution.
[02:00:11.067 --> 02:00:23.814]  When you're involved in these types of businesses, this is the type of activity that mobsters and gangsters in the government will be attracted to, and they will try to shake you down, obviously, and this is what's obviously going on.
[02:00:24.215 --> 02:00:26.236]  I don't think this should surprise anybody.
[02:00:26.856 --> 02:00:28.458]  Well let me talk.
[02:00:28.478 --> 02:00:32.161]  We're not saying that this surprises anybody.
[02:00:32.441 --> 02:00:43.050]  We're here because it's a big national case and the government is being hypocritical and so the attitude of just accepting that gangsters run the society and so that somehow we're wrong to be talking about this
[02:00:43.690 --> 02:00:45.631]  Uh, you know, really shows a nihilistic view.
[02:00:45.911 --> 02:00:47.993]  Now, now, you, you sound like an articulate person.
[02:00:48.053 --> 02:00:57.398]  Boil down what your particular, uh, acts to grind is with her or some personal thing that's happened to you in life, uh, that you're now psychologically attaching to her.
[02:00:57.458 --> 02:00:58.759]  I mean, what's the whole point here?
[02:00:59.409 --> 02:01:04.453]  Well, there's nothing like that at all, but I appreciate the attempt to try and misalign the issue.
[02:01:04.493 --> 02:01:05.074]  No, there is no attempt.
[02:01:05.094 --> 02:01:06.115]  You talk like a lawyer.
[02:01:06.155 --> 02:01:07.916]  I want to know what actions you got behind.
[02:01:07.936 --> 02:01:14.962]  The fact of the matter remains that your guest has spent a number of years trying to complete a law degree.
[02:01:15.022 --> 02:01:17.084]  I would suggest that she go and complete that degree.
[02:01:17.104 --> 02:01:19.006]  Yeah, that's an ad hominem attack.
[02:01:19.506 --> 02:01:19.886]  Not at all.
[02:01:19.906 --> 02:01:20.167]  Not at all.
[02:01:20.187 --> 02:01:20.547]  Not at all.
[02:01:35.383 --> 02:01:36.264]  Well, yeah.
[02:01:36.304 --> 02:01:38.646]  Let me just address the law school degree.
[02:01:38.926 --> 02:01:40.848]  I have a four-year degree in pre-law.
[02:01:41.208 --> 02:01:47.513]  I did go to law school for a year, and I do have an MBA in international business, so I don't think I'm a bit of a wash-up there.
[02:01:47.533 --> 02:01:49.194]  I didn't call you a wash-up.
[02:01:49.315 --> 02:01:50.155]  I didn't call you a wash-up.
[02:01:53.618 --> 02:01:54.218]  Put him on hold.
[02:01:54.438 --> 02:02:02.321]  He condescendingly, like the snake in the jungle book, went, I suggest you continue.
[02:02:02.641 --> 02:02:04.141]  I suggest you try.
[02:02:04.362 --> 02:02:08.203]  I mean, don't cast those stones and claim you didn't throw them.
[02:02:08.223 --> 02:02:08.503]  Go ahead.
[02:02:09.083 --> 02:02:16.465]  Well, also, regarding the age of the women that I hired, I hired women ages 23 to 25 years of age and up.
[02:02:16.545 --> 02:02:20.826]  I did not solicit young girls specifically for the very reason he's implying.
[02:02:21.166 --> 02:02:25.907]  And most of the women actually were in their mid to late 20s, 30s, and some even into their 40s.
[02:02:26.007 --> 02:02:29.827]  I'm gonna give Snake Man the final word on the other side on this and then take more calls.
[02:02:29.888 --> 02:02:30.868]  Dean, stay with us.
[02:02:31.888 --> 02:02:32.648]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:33.208 --> 02:02:36.469]  Baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you.
[02:02:44.529 --> 02:02:49.491]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:02:49.791 --> 02:02:55.233]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:02:55.273 --> 02:02:59.554]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:02:59.895 --> 02:03:02.916]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:03:03.216 --> 02:03:06.657]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:03:06.997 --> 02:03:16.339]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:03:16.599 --> 02:03:20.100]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:27.442]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:03:46.776 --> 02:03:52.238]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:52.619 --> 02:04:00.262]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:00.962 --> 02:04:08.008]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:08.408 --> 02:04:19.837]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:20.158 --> 02:04:23.741]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:24.121 --> 02:04:26.062]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:26.383 --> 02:04:30.226]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:43.436 --> 02:04:47.538]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[02:04:47.778 --> 02:04:52.861]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[02:04:53.161 --> 02:04:57.804]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[02:04:58.144 --> 02:05:00.105]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[02:05:00.425 --> 02:05:06.268]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:07.349]  And it works.
[02:05:07.842 --> 02:05:09.303]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[02:05:09.684 --> 02:05:10.705]  Now it's your turn.
[02:05:10.945 --> 02:05:13.327]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[02:05:13.467 --> 02:05:17.751]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[02:05:18.051 --> 02:05:21.154]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[02:05:21.514 --> 02:05:23.736]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:26.278]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:26.318 --> 02:05:26.578]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:26.598 --> 02:05:28.440]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:05:35.766 --> 02:05:36.467]  Guaranteed.
[02:05:36.647 --> 02:05:39.409]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:39.629 --> 02:05:40.510]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:40.991 --> 02:05:55.563]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:56.164 --> 02:05:59.206]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.627 --> 02:06:03.150]  We're talking with Gene Palfrey.
[02:06:05.743 --> 02:06:07.044]  And we're taking your calls right now.
[02:06:07.084 --> 02:06:11.346]  We're about to go to Mike and DJ, Rodney, Clayton and others.
[02:06:11.366 --> 02:06:14.148]  We've only got about 15 more minutes here or less.
[02:06:14.838 --> 02:06:19.220]  Real fast, Jeff in Canada, finish up your operation there.
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:19.800]  Thanks, Al.
[02:06:20.081 --> 02:06:22.742]  Name calling won't dissuade me or distract me from my fight.
[02:06:22.802 --> 02:06:28.565]  Referring to me as Snake Man, as you went out to the break there.
[02:06:28.885 --> 02:06:31.286]  Dirty politicians and prostitutes need to get right with God.
[02:06:31.306 --> 02:06:32.827]  Your moral compass is all over the place.
[02:06:33.067 --> 02:06:43.352]  Second point out, don't tell your callers to buy food, because the first thing the spooks do is they go to the database where all these people buy food, and they determine where people have stored food,
[02:06:43.712 --> 02:06:51.975]  And the first thing when they declare martial law, they go out to these houses that have weapons and caches of food, and they seize them, and they make public examples of these people.
[02:06:52.276 --> 02:06:52.756]  That's it.
[02:06:53.176 --> 02:06:54.817]  And by the way, you have a great show.
[02:06:54.857 --> 02:06:55.717]  I've enjoyed your show.
[02:06:55.737 --> 02:06:57.018]  You woke me up to the New World Order.
[02:06:57.058 --> 02:06:58.998]  I just think this is a major distraction.
[02:06:59.739 --> 02:07:00.379]  And that's it, Alex.
[02:07:00.459 --> 02:07:02.820]  Listen, I appreciate, sir, I appreciate your call.
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:04.721]  You know, that's ridiculous.
[02:07:06.161 --> 02:07:12.664]  I told my listeners, and we're going to run back to Gene in a minute, I told my listeners five, six, seven years ago to do what I do.
[02:07:13.431 --> 02:07:17.796]  Whatever I say to people that I think they should do is what I believe they should do.
[02:07:18.416 --> 02:07:20.399]  Get a small piece of property out in the country.
[02:07:20.779 --> 02:07:21.960]  I don't care if it's in the desert.
[02:07:22.561 --> 02:07:25.004]  As insurance, and also regular insurance too.
[02:07:25.965 --> 02:07:27.106]  Have some storable food.
[02:07:27.566 --> 02:07:28.667]  Have some firearms.
[02:07:28.928 --> 02:07:29.749]  Know how to use them.
[02:07:29.789 --> 02:07:32.071]  I tell women, go out and take a gun course.
[02:07:32.511 --> 02:07:33.733]  Protect yourself from predators.
[02:07:34.951 --> 02:07:37.552]  I tell people to buy gold at $300 an ounce.
[02:07:37.612 --> 02:07:38.572]  It's gone over $700.
[02:07:38.832 --> 02:07:40.013]  It's at $600 something right now.
[02:07:40.293 --> 02:07:42.713]  And the dollar's been devalued by 57% since then.
[02:07:43.033 --> 02:07:45.714]  I mean, the stuff I come up with is no-brainer.
[02:07:46.314 --> 02:07:46.554]  Okay?
[02:07:46.574 --> 02:07:49.515]  And if you start giving in to don't-own-guns, you'll be in a database.
[02:07:49.655 --> 02:07:51.996]  Or don't-have-storable-foods, they'll come get it from you.
[02:07:52.396 --> 02:07:55.177]  No, the government doesn't have the power to go get everybody's guns and food.
[02:07:55.577 --> 02:07:57.797]  They shut off the food and water, like New Orleans.
[02:07:58.058 --> 02:07:59.598]  They make you come in for help.
[02:08:00.217 --> 02:08:00.657]  Okay?
[02:08:01.298 --> 02:08:05.700]  So, I mean, that is totally wrong in your philosophy there too, sir.
[02:08:06.501 --> 02:08:08.102]  Jean, you want to comment on anything he was saying?
[02:08:09.843 --> 02:08:25.892]  Well, you know, I see these kinds of comments on the internet from time to time, and I tend to believe you didn't hit the nail on the head when you said that this really has more to do with him and his, perhaps, insecurities about whatever in life, women, whatever.
[02:08:26.311 --> 02:08:29.233]  Then it has to do with me and my particular situation.
[02:08:29.973 --> 02:08:35.376]  Many of the things he said have been greatly skewed and greatly taken out of proportion.
[02:08:36.257 --> 02:08:47.323]  The example here about the women in the Diamondback newspaper, that is a University of Maryland college newspaper, and I, for a very short period of time, advertised for graduate level age and above.
[02:08:47.782 --> 02:08:49.763]  Which is 22, 23 and above.
[02:08:50.103 --> 02:08:54.706]  Well look, regardless, we're having a discussion here about the police state and about hypocrisy.
[02:08:54.966 --> 02:08:57.187]  And you know, I'm a Christian.
[02:08:57.547 --> 02:09:04.931]  And I'm tired of people that get so pious and so worshipful of themselves that they won't even talk to tax collectors or prostitutes.
[02:09:05.191 --> 02:09:07.252]  But that's all that Jesus hung around with.
[02:09:07.772 --> 02:09:09.574]  So, I mean, I've just had enough of it.
[02:09:09.654 --> 02:09:11.456]  Enough of the holier-than-thou.
[02:09:11.536 --> 02:09:13.598]  You know, all of us have got problems.
[02:09:13.938 --> 02:09:14.819]  None of us are perfect.
[02:09:15.039 --> 02:09:16.801]  The point is, we're talking about hypocrisy here.
[02:09:17.222 --> 02:09:17.782]  That's correct.
[02:09:17.802 --> 02:09:18.202]  That's correct.
[02:09:18.223 --> 02:09:23.588]  There's not one of us who can't have their life, if examined under a microscope, just ripped apart.
[02:09:24.432 --> 02:09:25.713]  In one fashion or another.
[02:09:25.913 --> 02:09:26.334]  Exactly.
[02:09:26.354 --> 02:09:27.655]  That's why I'm not here judging.
[02:09:27.675 --> 02:09:31.358]  In fact, I mean, I don't think people should go to jail for using drugs.
[02:09:31.778 --> 02:09:32.759]  Not that I think drugs are good.
[02:09:32.799 --> 02:09:33.760]  I say don't use them.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:34.300]  They're bad.
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:37.082]  But, I mean, then Limbaugh says send everybody to prison.
[02:09:37.102 --> 02:09:37.903]  He uses drugs.
[02:09:37.943 --> 02:09:39.284]  It turns out he's on drugs.
[02:09:39.324 --> 02:09:40.145]  He doesn't go to prison.
[02:09:40.465 --> 02:09:43.428]  You know, I mean, I want people to live by the standards they put out.
[02:09:43.848 --> 02:09:44.989]  That's the whole point here.
[02:09:46.230 --> 02:09:48.131]  Let's go to Mike in Rhode Island.
[02:09:48.151 --> 02:09:48.732]  You're on the air.
[02:09:48.772 --> 02:09:49.112]  Go ahead.
[02:09:49.132 --> 02:09:50.493]  Hey, Alex.
[02:09:50.533 --> 02:09:51.494]  How are we doing today?
[02:09:51.614 --> 02:09:51.834]  Good.
[02:09:51.854 --> 02:09:53.756]  I haven't heard from you in a while, buddy.
[02:09:56.454 --> 02:09:58.295]  Does this go to the Grove, you figure?
[02:10:00.017 --> 02:10:04.460]  Well, we know they bring male prostitutes in there.
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:06.362]  It's going on right now in Northern California, but no.
[02:10:07.303 --> 02:10:09.004]  Have you ever heard of the Bohemian Grove?
[02:10:10.505 --> 02:10:10.765]  Me?
[02:10:10.865 --> 02:10:11.086]  No.
[02:10:11.146 --> 02:10:12.607]  No, I have not.
[02:10:12.787 --> 02:10:13.307]  No, I have not.
[02:10:13.568 --> 02:10:15.009]  That's north of San Francisco.
[02:10:15.089 --> 02:10:18.752]  It's an elite retreat where the mainly Republican leadership goes to frolic.
[02:10:19.672 --> 02:10:21.194]  Well, maybe that's why I haven't heard of it.
[02:10:22.094 --> 02:10:22.795]  Mike, anything else?
[02:10:23.690 --> 02:10:27.354]  Uh, yeah, just one more thing on a little different subject.
[02:10:28.155 --> 02:10:31.259]  Did you see the alert that Hal Turner put out?
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:33.221]  No, I didn't.
[02:10:34.262 --> 02:10:37.766]  Basically, somebody gave a document that they say came from the military.
[02:10:38.311 --> 02:10:42.413]  Talked about, uh, they're preparing for an insurgency in this country.
[02:10:43.154 --> 02:10:44.614]  Well, sir, that's admitted.
[02:10:44.634 --> 02:10:49.017]  I mean, we have a big article up on PrisonPlanet.com about that right now.
[02:10:49.037 --> 02:10:51.718]  I mean, that was in PDD 51.
[02:10:51.758 --> 02:10:53.919]  That was in John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:57.261]  I mean, that's coming up later in the show.
[02:10:57.301 --> 02:10:59.022]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:10:59.603 --> 02:11:02.924]  Let's talk to DJ in Illinois.
[02:11:02.944 --> 02:11:03.785]  You're on the air, DJ.
[02:11:04.705 --> 02:11:05.025]  Okay.
[02:11:05.166 --> 02:11:07.647]  Number one, I come pretty much from the same
[02:11:08.407 --> 02:11:15.593]  From the point of view that you are, Alex, I don't have anything good to say about prostitution and many other things.
[02:11:16.153 --> 02:11:31.586]  But, something comes to mind about someone named Hitler going after those classified as undesirables to set precedents.
[02:11:33.187 --> 02:11:37.371]  And a court precedent completely obliterating
[02:11:38.072 --> 02:11:49.279]  Due process, where the average person would say, well I'm not going to do anything about it, is one of the things that comes to mind.
[02:11:49.679 --> 02:11:54.202]  Yeah, they're using anti-terror provisions on her when she has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:11:55.362 --> 02:12:03.227]  And I'm also wondering if originally they were either looking for somebody amongst clients or whatever,
[02:12:04.147 --> 02:12:07.850]  ...to out or keep handy to out for a new media circus.
[02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:12.873]  Oh, there's no doubt that every time he decided he needed another diversion for one of his stunts.
[02:12:13.254 --> 02:12:14.134]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:12:14.374 --> 02:12:16.676]  I mean, going back 50 years, especially in D.C.
[02:12:16.716 --> 02:12:29.225]  and Maryland, and this has been congressional hearings, they have agents and people, and in such a big business, they even have P.I.s doing it and giving the data to the agencies, Defense Intelligence, CIA, and 50 others you haven't heard of, folks.
[02:12:29.685 --> 02:12:34.849]  And their shadow, you know, these normal operations and then are collecting the data there.
[02:12:34.889 --> 02:12:36.990]  That's just basic blackmail intelligence.
[02:12:37.571 --> 02:12:40.293]  Yes, a couple of things that popped in my head.
[02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:45.596]  And I don't think, this is kind of, you know, all you have to do is think.
[02:12:45.936 --> 02:12:48.498]  By the way, Jean, pop in any time with comments, but go ahead.
[02:12:48.558 --> 02:12:52.261]  Oh, no, I think the points that are being made are absolutely correct.
[02:12:53.081 --> 02:12:57.985]  Well, a couple other ones that have popped into my head is this idea of dragging all of this out.
[02:12:59.669 --> 02:13:11.606]  Um, these people are not only power mad, they're insane, they're paranoid, they're schizophrenic, and the list could go on.
[02:13:12.026 --> 02:13:12.507]  No, you're right.
[02:13:12.547 --> 02:13:13.188]  I gotta jump.
[02:13:13.248 --> 02:13:14.209]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:14.289 --> 02:13:16.512]  Rodney in Texas, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:13:16.532 --> 02:13:16.893]  Go ahead.
[02:13:17.952 --> 02:13:32.255]  Yeah, Saturday I was reading in the Washington Post that one of the young ladies that was involved in one of the professional ladies of leisure there, Miss Jean, that she turned up dead.
[02:13:32.355 --> 02:13:44.578]  They claim that she committed suicide, but based on what I heard Jean say about the profile that she used to recruit her girls, these ladies are very, very stable.
[02:13:45.228 --> 02:13:47.270]  Very strong-minded individuals.
[02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:54.658]  So I just don't believe that this young lady named Brandi Britton committed suicide.
[02:13:54.718 --> 02:13:55.960]  And I agree with you, Alex.
[02:13:56.060 --> 02:14:02.467]  It sounds to me like this was a black operation that turned sour.
[02:14:02.587 --> 02:14:07.072]  Well, remember right before 9-11 how they found the young aides' bones in the woods?
[02:14:07.995 --> 02:14:10.956]  Yeah, but I'd like to hear what Jean has to say about this, girl.
[02:14:10.976 --> 02:14:12.917]  I don't believe she committed suicide.
[02:14:12.937 --> 02:14:16.979]  And what else can you tell us about her situation?
[02:14:17.039 --> 02:14:21.021]  Because they're saying she committed suicide, but I don't believe that.
[02:14:21.802 --> 02:14:22.942]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:14:22.962 --> 02:14:26.304]  There's a lot of speculation whether or not it was suicide or homicide.
[02:14:26.758 --> 02:14:34.684]  Brandy worked for me a few years back when she committed suicide or was murdered, whatever the case may be.
[02:14:35.084 --> 02:14:38.807]  She was not in my employ and had not been for a year or so.
[02:14:38.827 --> 02:14:41.008]  So would you say she was stable?
[02:14:42.610 --> 02:14:45.031]  Yeah, I do remember her.
[02:14:45.091 --> 02:14:46.452]  She was a college professor.
[02:14:46.512 --> 02:14:48.234]  She had a PhD in sociology.
[02:14:48.254 --> 02:14:49.695]  Oh yes, of course she was stable.
[02:14:50.175 --> 02:14:52.036]  Yeah, she was in her early 40s.
[02:14:52.076 --> 02:14:52.857]  She was a mother.
[02:14:52.957 --> 02:14:54.078]  She had a couple of minor children.
[02:14:54.258 --> 02:14:54.778]  I think so.
[02:14:54.878 --> 02:14:55.919]  I think so.
[02:15:24.231 --> 02:15:25.973]  That is very much up in the air.
[02:15:26.774 --> 02:15:28.915]  And I just want to say this finally.
[02:15:29.336 --> 02:15:38.664]  I'm glad that you're exposing these two-faced people in Washington DC like David Vitter and Randall Tobias and probably the list goes on and on.
[02:15:39.145 --> 02:15:46.571]  And I just hope that you don't let these people pay you off and go ahead and expose them for what they really are.
[02:15:47.032 --> 02:15:50.415]  And thank you for your time Miss Jean and you too Alex.
[02:15:50.535 --> 02:15:51.135]  You bet, Rodney.
[02:15:51.175 --> 02:15:51.735]  Good to hear from you.
[02:15:51.755 --> 02:15:55.036]  Well, look, I mean, she's already dropped the atomic bomb on him.
[02:15:55.056 --> 02:15:56.896]  She's already released the numbers.
[02:15:58.376 --> 02:15:59.257]  Yeah, yeah, I have.
[02:15:59.377 --> 02:16:07.558]  And not to be concerned, I have no intention of letting anyone buy me off or make any kind of a deal with me.
[02:16:07.898 --> 02:16:09.498]  And you're not planning to commit suicide?
[02:16:09.718 --> 02:16:11.659]  And I'm not planning to commit suicide either.
[02:16:12.819 --> 02:16:15.099]  Well, it's definitely crazy times right now.
[02:16:15.519 --> 02:16:18.620]  Clayton in Texas, last call that we have time for with our guest.
[02:16:19.298 --> 02:16:21.099]  Alex, thank you so much for the job that you do.
[02:16:21.119 --> 02:16:27.122]  I just want to say, Gene, man, my heart goes out to you.
[02:16:27.142 --> 02:16:31.364]  Moral arguments aside, you have a right to due process.
[02:16:31.744 --> 02:16:32.305]  All of us do.
[02:16:32.325 --> 02:16:34.186]  You have a right to know what you're being charged for.
[02:16:34.546 --> 02:16:36.347]  You have a right for evidence to be presented.
[02:16:36.687 --> 02:16:40.729]  You have a right to not have your assets freeze so you can defend yourself.
[02:16:41.689 --> 02:16:53.933]  I run my own business, I pay my taxes, I've got 940, 941's, I've got stuff out the wazoo, I can't even hardly keep up with it all, and I do everything that I can to do the right thing, but I know when I go to my P.O.
[02:16:53.993 --> 02:17:00.335]  box, I just wonder when I'm going to get the letter that I missed something, and they're going to take everything I've worked my whole life.
[02:17:00.355 --> 02:17:01.556]  They're the mafia.
[02:17:01.616 --> 02:17:02.456]  It's insane!
[02:17:02.536 --> 02:17:06.137]  It is out of control, and we need to start standing up for ourselves.
[02:17:06.517 --> 02:17:10.080]  I agree, Clayton, we're out of time.
[02:17:11.101 --> 02:17:12.882]  I want to get you back up as this develops.
[02:17:12.982 --> 02:17:15.484]  Thank you, Jean Palfrey, for spending time with us.
[02:17:15.504 --> 02:17:18.106]  There's a link to your website with more details and the phone numbers.
[02:17:18.166 --> 02:17:21.629]  Everybody can help investigate on this, on your website.
[02:17:21.869 --> 02:17:24.971]  So again, thank you so much for your courage and coming on the show.
[02:17:26.872 --> 02:17:29.273]  Should we be looking for any big news we break in the next few weeks?
[02:17:30.094 --> 02:17:31.434]  There's a distinct possibility.
[02:17:32.035 --> 02:17:33.435]  There's a distinct possibility.
[02:17:34.696 --> 02:17:36.656]  We'll just have to see how it rolls out.
[02:17:37.017 --> 02:17:37.277]  All right.
[02:17:37.317 --> 02:17:39.017]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:17:39.037 --> 02:17:40.018]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:17:40.698 --> 02:17:42.039]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:42.059 --> 02:17:42.419]  Stay with me.

[02:18:37.948 --> 02:18:38.530]  Not available in Iowa.
[02:18:42.512 --> 02:18:42.972]  Gold.
[02:18:43.312 --> 02:18:44.593]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:44.853 --> 02:18:50.936]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:51.116 --> 02:18:54.938]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:55.298 --> 02:18:57.179]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:57.239 --> 02:18:59.520]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:07.244]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:19:07.244 --> 02:19:08.005]  We're good to go.
[02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:28.163]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[02:19:39.008 --> 02:19:44.511]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:45.071 --> 02:19:48.673]  Did you know that our founding fathers gave us a Republican form of government?
[02:19:49.332 --> 02:19:53.256]  Why is all you ever hear from our leaders is that we're a democracy?
[02:19:53.856 --> 02:19:59.541]  You can receive a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine by calling our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:59.561 --> 02:20:00.022]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:12.245 --> 02:20:14.667]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:15.367 --> 02:20:19.730]  Have you ever been told the truth about why Russian Communism seemingly has fallen?
[02:20:20.511 --> 02:20:23.393]  Why did our government let Mikhail Gorbachev come here?
[02:20:24.334 --> 02:20:29.477]  You can receive a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine by calling our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:29.497 --> 02:20:29.697]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:41.997 --> 02:20:45.140]  Musicians are writing songs in his honor.
[02:20:48.344 --> 02:20:51.447]  Citizens create their own videos about him.
[02:20:51.467 --> 02:20:53.029]  They chant his name in the streets.
[02:20:59.856 --> 02:21:14.450]  The man so loved by the people that he has sparked an electoral American revolution has now inspired a radio program dedicated to his campaign for the presidency of the United States.
[02:21:15.169 --> 02:21:27.011]  I'm Stephen Vincent, and I host Ron Paul Radio on GCN, Mondays through Fridays, from 3 to 4 Pacific, 5 to 6 Central, and 6 to 7 Eastern.
[02:21:27.331 --> 02:21:31.052]  Ron Paul Radio is the live voice of the freedom message.
[02:21:31.492 --> 02:21:41.134]  If you want to learn more about Ron Paul, and if you want to support his bid for the White House, tune in and call in to Ron Paul Radio.
[02:21:53.636 --> 02:21:57.222]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[02:21:59.408 --> 02:22:01.130]  So long, Texas!
[02:22:24.071 --> 02:22:25.632]  You get your guts kicked in.
[02:22:26.152 --> 02:22:31.476]  You know, that's the incredible thing about Mexico.
[02:22:31.496 --> 02:22:33.377]  100 million and growing.
[02:22:33.397 --> 02:22:36.079]  30% of their population living here.
[02:22:36.119 --> 02:22:38.000]  Highly nationalistic.
[02:22:38.100 --> 02:22:39.421]  Don't blame them, that's fine.
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:55.881]  That's normal, that's what you should be.
[02:22:57.042 --> 02:23:03.667]  And if you go down there, when you're not supposed to be there, they will beat the daylights out of you, suck any money out of you, steal your car.
[02:23:03.707 --> 02:23:04.828]  The government will, publicly.
[02:23:06.209 --> 02:23:10.193]  Call your family up and demand money out of you, and then you'll be lucky if you ever get out of there alive.
[02:23:11.514 --> 02:23:18.179]  And if you come into Mexico or Guatemala, they put you in a concentration camp for at least six months to work off the cost of arresting you.
[02:23:20.589 --> 02:23:24.190]  And you do anything wrong in Mexico, they will hang you out to dry.
[02:23:26.211 --> 02:23:36.735]  But then there's all this whining, and the cops in major cities don't give them DWIs or arrest them, but the citizens, because again, we're the dumb idiots.
[02:23:37.475 --> 02:23:40.436]  The government looks at us and goes, look, there's the morons.
[02:23:40.996 --> 02:23:43.717]  There's the people that think they're free and giggle and snicker to themselves.
[02:23:43.997 --> 02:23:44.597]  Well, not me.
[02:23:44.757 --> 02:23:46.578]  I want my real freedom, and I'm going to get it.
[02:23:47.122 --> 02:23:50.126]  And I'm not going to be living under martial law, and I'm not going along with this baloney.
[02:23:50.386 --> 02:23:52.209]  At least I'm not going to go down without a fight, I know that.
[02:23:54.852 --> 02:24:00.099]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, you know, we had a couple calls saying basically she was an evil demon because she ran an escort service.
[02:24:03.281 --> 02:24:17.449]  Uh, yes, that's not really a good thing, folks, but my point is, is that it's hypocritical for the government leadership to be involved in stuff far worse than enforcing against this lady, and then violating her due process and Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:24:17.970 --> 02:24:18.310]  That's it!
[02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:20.271]  It's a real simple equation.
[02:24:21.352 --> 02:24:32.098]  I mean, we get up here, I mean, you know, I, uh, I remember interviewing, uh, Christopher Boland when he worked for American Free Press many times, nice fella,
[02:24:32.890 --> 02:24:40.254]  Until I, I don't know, under pressure or whatever, he just got on with some weird people that, and just horrible things were written about me and other things.
[02:24:40.654 --> 02:24:41.094]  I don't care.
[02:24:41.114 --> 02:24:42.535]  I mean, really, I don't.
[02:24:42.575 --> 02:24:44.416]  That just sends people to listen to the show.
[02:24:44.676 --> 02:24:47.998]  That's what the people that attack me in the government and others don't realize, is I love it.
[02:24:48.778 --> 02:24:50.359]  When you're over the target, you get flack.
[02:24:50.379 --> 02:24:52.180]  I mean, if they're not attacking you, you're not doing your job.
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:59.443]  But even when the cops did violate his rights up in Illinois, up in Chicago, I mean, they did.
[02:24:59.463 --> 02:25:00.844]  It was in their own report.
[02:25:01.883 --> 02:25:10.246]  Frankly, I didn't believe a word he was saying by that point until I read their own report, and I was like, they say they tackled him in his own front yard, and they call that assaulting them?
[02:25:11.307 --> 02:25:12.567]  I went on there and I said it was wrong.
[02:25:15.288 --> 02:25:21.190]  So, uh, you know, I mean, it doesn't matter who it is out there, I try to stand up for people's rights.
[02:25:23.171 --> 02:25:26.252]  And more often than not, get bit in the hind end for it, but I mean, I don't care.
[02:25:26.912 --> 02:25:29.013]  Folks, either we all hang together or we hang separate.
[02:25:30.534 --> 02:25:31.154]  It's that simple.
[02:25:33.027 --> 02:25:37.749]  And I see it in so many squad car videos on YouTube and on television and in my own life.
[02:25:38.370 --> 02:25:46.873]  I've been to trials of friends where the cops grab you out of the car, slam you to the ground, you don't even resist them, and they charge you with assaulting them.
[02:25:46.973 --> 02:25:48.074]  Watch the Abbey Newman video.
[02:25:49.022 --> 02:25:52.343]  It's a naval veteran, no criminal record, buying and canning supplies in town.
[02:25:52.604 --> 02:25:53.784]  Doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
[02:25:53.984 --> 02:25:55.925]  She comes to a checkpoint or search everybody's car.
[02:25:56.185 --> 02:25:56.925]  They want to search her.
[02:25:56.945 --> 02:25:57.606]  She says no.
[02:25:58.166 --> 02:26:01.167]  They jerk her out of the car and go, what are we going to charge you with?
[02:26:01.547 --> 02:26:02.668]  A saltinose?
[02:26:03.868 --> 02:26:06.509]  And they went home that night and went to sleep and felt good!
[02:26:07.029 --> 02:26:08.830]  Because she's not a human being to them.
[02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:10.131]  They become psychopathic.
[02:26:10.371 --> 02:26:11.251]  And they don't even know it!
[02:26:12.091 --> 02:26:13.432]  I mean, folks, it's psychopathic!
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:21.063]  You know how bad I would feel if I was a cop and I was about to ruin somebody's life and have them on probation or prison time?
[02:26:21.483 --> 02:26:23.344]  She was facing two counts of three years each.
[02:26:25.224 --> 02:26:30.787]  How bad I would feel if I was a cop, if I was about to send some woman to prison for something she hadn't done?
[02:26:30.847 --> 02:26:32.407]  I mean, I would not be able to sleep.
[02:26:32.907 --> 02:26:34.308]  I would be racked with guilt.
[02:26:35.168 --> 02:26:37.509]  Because let me tell you something, my head is screwed on straight, folks.
[02:26:38.450 --> 02:26:44.132]  Because instinctively, in my very programming, I know that if I did bad stuff to people, that's going to come back on me.
[02:26:45.592 --> 02:26:49.173]  Now, at the conscious level, it's not a self-serving attitude that keeps you from being evil.
[02:26:50.013 --> 02:26:52.674]  At a conscious level, you know, it has the feeling of immoral.
[02:26:53.154 --> 02:26:56.235]  And, you know, I do the right thing because it feels good to me.
[02:26:57.236 --> 02:26:58.596]  The establishment calls that sappy.
[02:26:58.936 --> 02:27:01.437]  But really, it's just my ingrained self-preservation.
[02:27:01.837 --> 02:27:07.179]  I don't want to be in a tribe with a bunch of backstabbing, tattling, snitch scum all over the place.
[02:27:09.439 --> 02:27:11.880]  That's what we've become, just a pack of evil.
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:13.120]  Not just our police.
[02:27:13.901 --> 02:27:14.721]  We're evil, folks.
[02:27:15.390 --> 02:27:16.570]  Have you watched our television?
[02:27:16.890 --> 02:27:18.331]  You've seen the 50 million abortions?
[02:27:20.311 --> 02:27:21.252]  You've seen what's going on?
[02:27:21.272 --> 02:27:25.133]  I mean, we are mooey wicked.
[02:27:26.833 --> 02:27:28.114]  We're some evil hombres.
[02:27:29.154 --> 02:27:31.415]  We've got to turn it around, folks, or we're going to be judged.
[02:27:31.775 --> 02:27:32.595]  It's the way it works.
[02:27:33.175 --> 02:27:34.095]  We're on the march.
[02:27:34.555 --> 02:27:36.176]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.076 --> 02:27:39.777]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.243 --> 02:27:48.725]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:49.165 --> 02:27:53.387]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:53.827 --> 02:28:00.670]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:01.130 --> 02:28:07.836]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:08.157 --> 02:28:09.758]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:28:10.059 --> 02:28:13.242]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:13.522 --> 02:28:15.984]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:28:16.284 --> 02:28:23.031]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:23.451 --> 02:28:26.134]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:28:26.394 --> 02:28:29.777]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[02:28:29.817 --> 02:28:30.178]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:30.198 --> 02:28:31.999]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:28:43.323 --> 02:28:47.404]  We've all seen the Tornado device on TV and wondered if it really worked.
[02:28:47.845 --> 02:28:57.048]  I was also skeptical at first until we tested six Tornado units and in every case we got more miles per gallon and felt more power.
[02:28:57.348 --> 02:29:02.729]  Gasoline is expensive so when we find something that saves us money it just makes sense to get it.
[02:29:03.010 --> 02:29:09.652]  Call 800-500-8880 and order your Tornado unit today or visit TornadoAir.com
[02:29:12.635 --> 02:29:13.676]  Oil is oil.
[02:29:14.236 --> 02:29:15.317]  Don't kid yourself!
[02:29:15.457 --> 02:29:18.579]  Technology makes better oils possible, like Royal Purple.
[02:29:18.759 --> 02:29:21.941]  Royal Purple reduces friction and increases film strength.
[02:29:22.242 --> 02:29:28.266]  Go to RoyalPurple.com and you'll find independent test results from North Carolina and Oklahoma State.
[02:29:28.426 --> 02:29:30.027]  Not hype, just facts.
[02:29:30.307 --> 02:29:31.067]  What's in it for you?
[02:29:31.188 --> 02:29:35.871]  Superior protection, fewer oil changes, more horsepower, torque, and better gas mileage.
[02:29:36.031 --> 02:29:41.634]  Find Royal Purple at Napa, O'Reilly's, your local high-performance center, and RoyalPurple.com.
[02:29:41.915 --> 02:29:42.235]  Today!
[02:29:43.916 --> 02:29:49.678]  Millions of people suffer daily with back pain, hip pain, leg pain, sciatica, poor posture and more.
[02:29:50.118 --> 02:29:55.260]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home anytime you need to help relieve the pain and not just treat the symptoms?
[02:29:55.901 --> 02:30:01.963]  All of these people are relaxing on a unique device placed under the hips to elevate the sacrum and let tight muscles relax.
[02:30:02.443 --> 02:30:05.925]  It's called the Sacroedgy.
[02:30:06.125 --> 02:30:10.947]  And was invented by a sports trainer to first help his athletes and now is helping thousands.
[02:30:12.529 --> 02:30:17.911]  The Sacro Wedgie is not a quick fix, but a lifestyle and can even be used sitting at a desk or in the car.
[02:30:18.451 --> 02:30:19.571]  Of course, results will vary.
[02:30:19.771 --> 02:30:22.913]  However, the more balanced you are, the fewer problems you'll have.
[02:30:23.353 --> 02:30:25.133]  Relax 20 minutes daily for release.
[02:30:25.493 --> 02:30:30.075]  It only costs $29.95 for the Sacro Wedgie and $12.95 for the Neck Roll.
[02:30:30.475 --> 02:30:33.556]  Visit our website at www.sacrowedgie.com or call 1-800-737-9295 for a free brochure.
[02:30:33.576 --> 02:30:35.277]  The Sacro Wedgie works when all else fails.
[02:30:47.335 --> 02:30:47.516]  Oh, yeah.
[02:31:12.546 --> 02:31:17.594]  Monday through Friday, defending liberty, resisting tyranny from 11 a.m.
[02:31:17.674 --> 02:31:19.496]  until 2 p.m.
[02:31:19.536 --> 02:31:23.983]  Back on The Big Bird at The Network, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:31:24.023 --> 02:31:26.828]  You can listen on the Internet whenever you wish.
[02:31:28.727 --> 02:31:30.930]  At Infowars.com.
[02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.711]  21 hours a day.
[02:31:31.751 --> 02:31:35.897]  We restream the show after the live program from 2 back until it starts again at 11 a.m.
[02:31:35.917 --> 02:31:40.783]  You can listen at 9 in the morning, 10 at night, doesn't matter, 3 a.m.
[02:31:40.803 --> 02:31:43.126]  You can also tune in via the podcast.
[02:31:43.667 --> 02:31:44.908]  At InfoWars.com.
[02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:46.410]  Free to subscribers.
[02:31:46.430 --> 02:31:50.293]  You just go click on it and it goes right to your MP3 player or iPod or iPhone.
[02:31:50.833 --> 02:31:52.295]  I know a lot of you already use that.
[02:31:52.435 --> 02:31:53.776]  I hope you'll spread the word about it.
[02:31:53.816 --> 02:31:55.137]  That's how we reach new people.
[02:31:55.197 --> 02:31:59.981]  That's how, you know, instead of talking to yourself, blowing the phase, which I think is also important, get my films.
[02:32:00.061 --> 02:32:00.862]  Make copies of them.
[02:32:00.902 --> 02:32:03.704]  All the other Patriot documentaries that we carry, you're allowed to make copies of.
[02:32:05.726 --> 02:32:07.828]  Go get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:32:07.848 --> 02:32:10.390]  Print off 20, 30 copies of America.
[02:32:12.173 --> 02:32:16.979]  In Detroit by Design, go print off copies of all of my films that are up there.
[02:32:16.999 --> 02:32:18.400]  Print off my books.
[02:32:19.301 --> 02:32:20.042]  The book I wrote.
[02:32:20.062 --> 02:32:22.065]  9-11 dissent and deterrenty.
[02:32:22.105 --> 02:32:23.026]  Burn it on the disk.
[02:32:23.106 --> 02:32:24.127]  Put the file on a disker.
[02:32:24.407 --> 02:32:25.369]  Print out hard copies.
[02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:26.990]  Print out Order Out of Chaos.
[02:32:27.050 --> 02:32:28.492]  Elite Sponsor Terror and the New World Order.
[02:32:28.772 --> 02:32:29.674]  No longer in print.
[02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:31.856]  I frankly don't have the money to print 5,000 more copies of it.
[02:32:33.186 --> 02:32:34.367]  It's probably never even sell that.
[02:32:34.427 --> 02:32:35.087]  It's a great book.
[02:32:35.107 --> 02:32:38.609]  We're getting a lot of requests for it, but we get to the point where we can't even print stuff again.
[02:32:38.629 --> 02:32:48.474]  Well, it's there at PrisonPlanet.tv, along with all my films, including the new Terror Storm special edition, and weekly TV reports, and just all this material.
[02:32:48.534 --> 02:32:49.675]  Thousands of pieces of media.
[02:32:50.075 --> 02:32:51.195]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:51.295 --> 02:32:52.176]  It is a foundry.
[02:32:52.656 --> 02:32:54.337]  It is an armory.
[02:32:54.497 --> 02:32:58.179]  It is an arsenal of resistance against the New World Order.
[02:33:00.197 --> 02:33:03.099]  And it is literally you, the listeners, that allow us to reach new people.
[02:33:04.040 --> 02:33:24.214]  And I think that it's safe to say that when you point people in the direction of this radio show or my films or the materials we offer, much of it free, that you're putting them in touch with some of the best information out there, bar none, because we cover it all, we've done our homework, we understand the New World Order's operations, and we're here fighting them toe-to-toe.
[02:33:25.635 --> 02:33:31.467]  Now, before I go to a loaded bank of calls, I'm going to take five calls in a row and that's going to be it for those holding the longest.
[02:33:32.889 --> 02:33:36.977]  And then I'm going to hit some news I haven't gotten to yet and recap some martial law news as well.
[02:33:38.450 --> 02:33:40.932]  Let me tell you about a couple of our sponsors.
[02:33:41.072 --> 02:33:47.237]  One of them is Shellicate, and the company that puts it out gives it the name of Shellocene.
[02:33:47.597 --> 02:33:54.002]  And really it's just 84 different types of minerals in ionic form mined out of the Himalayas.
[02:33:54.022 --> 02:33:56.484]  There's also one area in Scandinavia where you can find it.
[02:33:57.105 --> 02:33:59.967]  And it is an alluvial deposit of minerals.
[02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:04.063]  And it's powerful stuff.
[02:34:04.543 --> 02:34:07.286]  And minerals, more and more I learn and research, are the key.
[02:34:07.926 --> 02:34:09.648]  And they've got a deal until the end of this week.
[02:34:10.069 --> 02:34:11.270]  It's only until the end of the month.
[02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:13.111]  So I guess a few days into next week.
[02:34:13.492 --> 02:34:24.983]  And then he's going to stop offering this deal, where you can order it just with your name and address, no credit card number, and if you like it in three months, pay for the first order, they'll send you a second.
[02:34:25.538 --> 02:34:27.259]  I mean, you talk about try it before you buy it.
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:29.401]  This is literally try it before you buy it.
[02:34:29.741 --> 02:34:34.445]  It's not some gimmick where you give the credit card number and then can reverse it if you want and spend an hour doing that.
[02:34:34.725 --> 02:34:36.767]  This is if you like it, want to order more, you pay for it.
[02:34:37.287 --> 02:34:38.388]  You cannot beat that deal.
[02:34:38.408 --> 02:34:39.829]  877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or blacklistedherb.com, blacklistedherb.com.
[02:34:48.809 --> 02:34:57.559]  Also, you can check out all our sponsors, including the one I'm about to tell you about at prisonplanet.com, there in the banner section, there on the right hand side.
[02:34:59.861 --> 02:35:02.224]  There's also Researched Herbs at researchedherbs.com.
[02:35:03.979 --> 02:35:06.800]  And they've got hundreds of the well-documented, mainline stuff.
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:17.884]  By mainline, most of you, probably including myself, didn't know about them, that for hundreds of years have been known for their nutritive and healing effects for different problems, both preventative and once you have a problem.
[02:35:18.244 --> 02:35:21.105]  LIV52 is the world's best-selling liver support formula.
[02:35:21.385 --> 02:35:24.586]  Go find out about that one particular product there on their website.
[02:35:24.966 --> 02:35:28.968]  Endorsed by over 200,000 healthcare professionals, an herbal registered drug in 45 countries.
[02:35:30.883 --> 02:35:32.924]  Just deliver detox, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:35:33.285 --> 02:35:33.865]  1-800-845-3841.
[02:35:34.625 --> 02:35:43.971]  Or check out, not just Liz52, but all their great products at researchherbs.com.
[02:35:45.192 --> 02:35:47.153]  Let's go ahead, and I'm going to go fast here through your calls.
[02:35:47.473 --> 02:35:48.794]  Paul in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:35:48.834 --> 02:35:49.134]  Go ahead.
[02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:50.231]  Hi, Alex.
[02:35:50.351 --> 02:35:51.493]  Many of us are grateful to Ms.
[02:35:51.553 --> 02:35:51.994]  Palfrey.
[02:35:52.054 --> 02:36:00.667]  She has done the unthinkable, and it's the only strategy when you've been targeted by these weakling cowards who, as you say, are in all these mafias within the system.
[02:36:00.707 --> 02:36:02.069]  People have to understand this.
[02:36:02.490 --> 02:36:04.694]  When you have a target on you, when they've targeted you,
[02:36:05.114 --> 02:36:11.738]  The only solution, the only way you're going to survive is to paint an even bigger target on your front, on your back, and make a big noise.
[02:36:11.818 --> 02:36:14.159]  We had a circumstance in our family, it's ongoing.
[02:36:14.299 --> 02:36:17.821]  The court system shook us down for millions of dollars.
[02:36:17.841 --> 02:36:20.102]  There are people in our family who have been murdered over this.
[02:36:20.202 --> 02:36:21.663]  I can verify everything I say.
[02:36:22.143 --> 02:36:37.113]  And what stopped these bums, these no-good cowards in Naples, Florida and Providence, Rhode Island, who frequent the courthouse, what stopped them dead in their tracks, Alex, is when I went out to the Internet and started writing about them and now they're just tearing out their hair and they're beside themselves.
[02:36:37.133 --> 02:36:41.776]  They're threatening libel suits and we say, good, go ahead, it'll be their undoing.
[02:36:42.156 --> 02:36:46.279]  These people are cowards, Alex, and like insects, you shine light on them,
[02:36:46.775 --> 02:36:51.840]  They wither, shrivel, and blow away in the wind like dried-up cow manure that they are.
[02:36:52.701 --> 02:36:53.682]  Well, absolutely.
[02:36:53.962 --> 02:37:00.608]  And, you know, some people are like, well, that woman doesn't have a right to defense or a right to her due process because of what she did and basically attacked her.
[02:37:00.988 --> 02:37:02.069]  It doesn't matter who you are.
[02:37:02.109 --> 02:37:03.311]  You deserve due process.
[02:37:03.331 --> 02:37:05.673]  You know, people always say, let's get the globalists and string them up.
[02:37:06.033 --> 02:37:06.894]  No, let's have trials.
[02:37:08.215 --> 02:37:12.917]  We need to maintain our rule of law and our system, you know, number one.
[02:37:13.037 --> 02:37:14.278]  And it is going to see.
[02:37:14.318 --> 02:37:23.482]  That's what happened in Soviet Russia, and Nazi Germany, and China, is that these elites just get so abusive, and their minions get so abusive, that they start just wrecking the society.
[02:37:23.522 --> 02:37:26.484]  And right now, who can deny the bureaucrats are out of control?
[02:37:27.085 --> 02:37:33.228]  They're completely out of control and such sanctimony, such hypocrisy from these people criticizing Ms.
[02:37:33.288 --> 02:37:33.788]  Palfrey.
[02:37:34.188 --> 02:37:35.529]  What about her clients?
[02:37:35.769 --> 02:37:52.917]  And even worse, the scum, the human garbage that calls itself government agents, that harass this woman for committing absolutely no crime, for doing nothing wrong, other than the fact somebody might spill the beans on these bums and they'll be in trouble when they come home to their boyfriend at night.
[02:37:53.397 --> 02:37:53.998]  Absolutely.
[02:37:54.038 --> 02:37:55.599]  Go, Mrs. Palfrey.
[02:37:55.639 --> 02:37:56.719]  Keep publicizing.
[02:37:57.179 --> 02:37:58.780]  These people hate publicity.
[02:37:58.860 --> 02:38:00.081]  It frightens them to death.
[02:38:00.842 --> 02:38:02.263]  And that's what she's saying.
[02:38:02.323 --> 02:38:04.784]  She's saying, why aren't you going after any of the Johns?
[02:38:04.824 --> 02:38:05.184]  That's it.
[02:38:05.224 --> 02:38:05.905]  I'm releasing it.
[02:38:06.645 --> 02:38:09.147]  And that'll certainly teach them next time.
[02:38:09.207 --> 02:38:10.147]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:10.748 --> 02:38:12.188]  Let's talk to Phillip in Florida.
[02:38:12.228 --> 02:38:13.069]  Phillip, you're on the air.
[02:38:13.109 --> 02:38:13.509]  Go ahead.
[02:38:13.529 --> 02:38:18.032]  Go in once, Phillip.
[02:38:18.712 --> 02:38:19.613]  Go in twice, Phillip.
[02:38:20.248 --> 02:38:20.568]  Gone.
[02:38:21.348 --> 02:38:23.449]  Uh, Sean in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:38:23.469 --> 02:38:25.209]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:38:25.229 --> 02:38:25.569]  Good, sir.
[02:38:26.109 --> 02:38:39.911]  Um, well, I'm in Brooklyn, I've been here basically all my life, and I can tell you that, uh, from the time that I've been a kid up until now, I've been here all my life, you can see the intensity of the police department growing.
[02:38:39.931 --> 02:38:49.353]  Well, they've doubled the numbers, and I mean, they literally run up and just scream at people for no reason, and they've been told to let everybody know that they're the boss.
[02:38:50.981 --> 02:38:55.585]  I had an idea for the people going around with video cameras in New York.
[02:38:56.205 --> 02:39:02.671]  Perhaps they should take a laptop and maybe one of those wireless cards for Sprint or whoever.
[02:39:02.691 --> 02:39:03.772]  That's what people are already doing.
[02:39:03.792 --> 02:39:05.693]  WeAreChange.org does that all the time.
[02:39:06.074 --> 02:39:08.556]  Yeah, because they should stream it and archive it.
[02:39:08.576 --> 02:39:10.878]  That way even if they take the camera, it's out there.
[02:39:11.218 --> 02:39:14.561]  Well, that's what happened when our reporters from WeAreChange.org.com
[02:39:16.302 --> 02:39:21.604]  Just a month or so ago, we were at the RNC debate, and they arrested them.
[02:39:21.684 --> 02:39:23.284]  They were wirelessly sending it out.
[02:39:23.464 --> 02:39:31.306]  I saw it live as it happened, and the technology is still a little bit shaky, but as it gets better, it's just going to be amazing.
[02:39:31.906 --> 02:39:32.386]  Anything else?
[02:39:32.406 --> 02:39:39.028]  Yeah, I had a comment on the eugenics that's going on, especially over in Africa.
[02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:41.409]  Basically, it seems like
[02:39:42.472 --> 02:39:53.421]  They're trying to wipe out the human DNA, and if you believe in evolution, that everybody came out of Africa, it's like they're trying to wipe out the original DNA so that it can't be rebuilt at some time in the future.
[02:39:55.282 --> 02:39:56.243]  Well, I know this.
[02:39:56.263 --> 02:40:01.207]  The elite are completely insane, and they're schizophrenic at the same time.
[02:40:01.247 --> 02:40:02.148]  I appreciate your call.
[02:40:02.608 --> 02:40:05.070]  They openly have policies to end
[02:40:09.045 --> 02:40:18.348]  You know, the white sub-race, or the Anglo variety, Nordic variety, I mean, those policies have been declassified.
[02:40:18.368 --> 02:40:19.788]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[02:40:19.828 --> 02:40:27.810]  They have a policy to make sure white people, at any cost to the media, the hype, in any of their diversity.
[02:40:27.850 --> 02:40:29.131]  People can marry whoever they want.
[02:40:29.151 --> 02:40:30.071]  It doesn't matter to me.
[02:40:30.111 --> 02:40:32.572]  My point is, why is the media aggressively pushing it?
[02:40:32.592 --> 02:40:33.392]  The point is, they are.
[02:40:33.832 --> 02:40:35.032]  So we're just reporting on that fact.
[02:40:35.353 --> 02:40:36.873]  Now, at the same time, they have an agenda.
[02:40:37.828 --> 02:40:39.289]  To tell blacks to intermarry, too.
[02:40:39.309 --> 02:40:47.332]  They don't want blacks, you know, staying cohesive or having any type of, you know, care about their group or any pride in their history.
[02:40:49.133 --> 02:40:53.415]  And then, they certainly are carrying out more aggressively against Africans than any other group.
[02:40:53.435 --> 02:40:55.536]  And the New World Order has it out for Africa.
[02:40:55.676 --> 02:40:57.097]  See, we're just reporting the facts here.
[02:40:58.077 --> 02:40:59.798]  And that's what I mean by schizophrenic policy.
[02:40:59.838 --> 02:41:02.379]  The same elites have got it out for white people.
[02:41:03.050 --> 02:41:04.390]  The general, you know, whites.
[02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:08.931]  And a lot of evidence shows it because they believe they're going to get competition from that group if they say that.
[02:41:09.331 --> 02:41:11.852]  I say a lot of evidence, they state it, so I just answered my own question.
[02:41:12.152 --> 02:41:13.892]  But it's important to ask those questions of yourselves.
[02:41:13.912 --> 02:41:15.192]  You'll come up with different angles of it.
[02:41:16.172 --> 02:41:19.113]  But they really have it out for blacks.
[02:41:20.613 --> 02:41:24.054]  And then secondarily, they have it out for Latin Americans.
[02:41:24.734 --> 02:41:26.434]  And then after that, they have it out for Asians.
[02:41:27.694 --> 02:41:30.375]  And, I mean, the stuff they've done.
[02:41:30.395 --> 02:41:30.975]  I mean, I've got
[02:41:32.333 --> 02:41:41.138]  I've got 1995 articles here out of the Times of London front page where top scientists and the government admitted that they were putting AIDS in smallpox shots in Africa.
[02:41:41.538 --> 02:41:44.799]  Like, I just came across that again today and was reminded of seeing it years ago.
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:48.341]  The media just says, oh, the conspiracy theorists say that.
[02:41:48.982 --> 02:41:51.283]  It's absolutely proven.
[02:41:51.703 --> 02:41:53.204]  It's not like it's our opinion.
[02:41:54.424 --> 02:42:00.087]  And that's what's so frustrating about this, is that they're doing this.
[02:42:00.107 --> 02:42:01.208]  These people are nuts, man.
[02:42:02.378 --> 02:42:05.820]  They say over and over again, they want to dumb down the mass of humanity.
[02:42:05.860 --> 02:42:08.602]  They want to dumb down their competition, which they're very racist.
[02:42:08.622 --> 02:42:10.564]  They see whites as their main competition.
[02:42:11.824 --> 02:42:15.207]  And so the elite at one level are waging war on the number of whites.
[02:42:16.628 --> 02:42:19.550]  And again, I'm not saying that's legitimate, but I'm saying what the elite believes.
[02:42:19.570 --> 02:42:24.453]  They believe, specifically Nordics, blonde-haired, blue-eyed types,
[02:42:25.593 --> 02:42:26.534]  With the high cheekbones.
[02:42:27.134 --> 02:42:29.615]  They believe that that is the super race.
[02:42:30.416 --> 02:42:34.538]  And that they're actively trying to call back the numbers of those because that's a competition for them.
[02:42:35.078 --> 02:42:52.927]  And at the same time, because they believe the non-dominant variant of Homo Sapien Sapien, the Anglo, since it's so precious, and since blacks have the original DNA code, and it just tends to be more dominant, that they need to be exterminated first and foremost.
[02:42:52.947 --> 02:42:53.327]  So yes.
[02:42:54.213 --> 02:42:55.774]  A. They're knocking out their competition.
[02:42:56.595 --> 02:42:58.016]  B. They want to kill the blacks.
[02:42:58.036 --> 02:43:00.417]  That's their near and dear heart to do that.
[02:43:01.258 --> 02:43:03.179]  And kill everybody else for that matter.
[02:43:03.899 --> 02:43:06.621]  I mean, it's so incredible when you read book after book.
[02:43:06.641 --> 02:43:12.845]  I mean, I was up here last night finishing the final voiceover for Endgame and I just didn't know... I had to cut it down.
[02:43:12.865 --> 02:43:16.328]  It took me days because I couldn't make the film five hours long.
[02:43:16.888 --> 02:43:22.412]  It's already 130 plus minutes long and I've already cut about as much as I can cut.
[02:43:24.261 --> 02:43:25.202]  I'm already digressing.
[02:43:25.242 --> 02:43:25.562]  What is it?
[02:43:25.903 --> 02:43:29.486]  It's just... It's just so incredible.
[02:43:31.228 --> 02:43:37.254]  And then to have these Live Aid concerts, and Earth Aid, and Live Earth, and... Oh, we're helping the Africans!
[02:43:37.374 --> 02:43:39.196]  It is so cynical!
[02:43:40.817 --> 02:43:48.745]  I mean, Planned Parenthood's helping the blacks, and... and the Gates and... Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Warren Buffett are helping them.
[02:43:49.483 --> 02:43:54.086]  Meanwhile, we got quotes from Ted Turner, you know, giving a billion to do it, calling them all sorts of names.
[02:43:55.347 --> 02:44:01.651]  I mean, I cannot imagine being a multi-billionaire and wanting to give my money away to sterilize black people.
[02:44:03.552 --> 02:44:04.993]  I mean, can you imagine that?
[02:44:05.513 --> 02:44:06.694]  When, by the way, that won't work.
[02:44:07.154 --> 02:44:10.076]  It just shows that those that aren't sterilized just end up having the five children.
[02:44:11.388 --> 02:44:14.711]  What works is going and lifting those people up and industrializing them.
[02:44:15.311 --> 02:44:17.153]  And people say, well, blacks can't be industrialized.
[02:44:17.173 --> 02:44:19.394]  They always descend into butchery.
[02:44:21.296 --> 02:44:27.161]  Well, most primitive societies do that, and it's very rare that you get a society, a free society, where it's able to build.
[02:44:27.661 --> 02:44:28.742]  You're able to get a renaissance.
[02:44:29.648 --> 02:44:39.258]  I mean, the Germanic tribes were killing each other for thousands of years and could never build up a civilization, even though they were very smart, because they were too busy killing each other and enslaving each other, just like the Africans.
[02:44:39.638 --> 02:44:49.569]  So I've actually studied sociology and ancient sociology, archaeology, and the ancient cultures, and so a lot of the stereotypes you see put on black civilization
[02:44:50.609 --> 02:44:51.889]  aren't particularly accurate.
[02:44:52.109 --> 02:44:55.450]  Or let's say they're taking data and then mis-extrapolating it.
[02:44:55.750 --> 02:45:01.911]  Like, I know for a fact that they'll go finance one tribe to kill another every time they build a city or a civilization.
[02:45:02.131 --> 02:45:04.612]  Or every time blacks get some resources.
[02:45:06.252 --> 02:45:12.593]  Blacks actually do organize themselves into operating societies in many cases thousands of years ago.
[02:45:15.273 --> 02:45:17.994]  And then climate change and other things knock those civilizations out.
[02:45:19.006 --> 02:45:23.348]  Uh... but uh... I mean regardless folks, regardless.
[02:45:23.388 --> 02:45:25.089]  Let's say you're a racist and you don't like black people.
[02:45:26.110 --> 02:45:27.851]  I just want to give you a little news tip.
[02:45:27.951 --> 02:45:29.832]  You're not going to be safe with this elite running things.
[02:45:29.872 --> 02:45:31.233]  By the way, you're in the crosshairs too.
[02:45:32.113 --> 02:45:33.994]  And we all just have to come to that realization.
[02:45:34.014 --> 02:45:37.616]  I mean that's what I tell these radical racist Mexicans in La Reconquista.
[02:45:38.447 --> 02:45:40.828]  I'm like, what do you think you're doing with your Raza and all this?
[02:45:41.268 --> 02:45:42.889]  And oh yeah, you're gonna bring down America.
[02:45:43.249 --> 02:45:45.390]  Don't you know the globalists are using you?
[02:45:45.790 --> 02:45:48.532]  And opening the door for you and literally greasing the skids?
[02:45:48.952 --> 02:45:53.494]  And telling the police that you live by two sets of rules and that you're above the law?
[02:45:53.514 --> 02:45:55.775]  I mean, why do you think the door is open?
[02:45:56.315 --> 02:45:58.196]  Why do you think you're getting VIP status?
[02:45:58.296 --> 02:46:00.357]  It's not to help you and your people.
[02:46:00.517 --> 02:46:02.578]  I mean, let me give you a newsflash here.
[02:46:03.339 --> 02:46:05.340]  You're being used to bring this country down.
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:06.120]  Period.
[02:46:06.852 --> 02:46:10.293]  And the same thing for the radical black groups like Khalid Mohammed.
[02:46:11.593 --> 02:46:12.953]  We never played that clip of him.
[02:46:13.413 --> 02:46:16.174]  Do you have the one where all the GDs and stuff are cut out of it?
[02:46:18.274 --> 02:46:20.074]  I just spurred the moment I told John to find out.
[02:46:20.094 --> 02:46:21.155]  We never heard it a few weeks ago.
[02:46:21.175 --> 02:46:22.355]  You know, we kill the women?
[02:46:22.375 --> 02:46:24.315]  Why don't we kill the white babies?
[02:46:24.395 --> 02:46:26.896]  Beautiful, blue-eyed, blonde-haired babies?
[02:46:27.496 --> 02:46:28.676]  Why don't we kill the woman?
[02:46:28.736 --> 02:46:33.677]  Because when the white woman lays down on her back every nine months, the reinforcements roll out.
[02:46:34.611 --> 02:46:36.833]  Well, see, that's the elite's attitude, Mr. Muhammad.
[02:46:37.053 --> 02:46:37.773]  That's what he says!
[02:46:38.374 --> 02:46:41.316]  He said, well, they've been killing us, we're gonna kill them!
[02:46:43.157 --> 02:46:44.418]  That's what the New World Order said.
[02:46:46.139 --> 02:46:46.860]  That's what they say.
[02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:48.000]  They say it's whoever can kill.
[02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:49.261]  It's whoever can take over.
[02:46:50.802 --> 02:46:52.364]  Let me tell the black leadership something.
[02:46:52.584 --> 02:46:58.047]  The New World Order can snap its fingers and kill every black person on the planet in a matter of weeks.
[02:46:59.008 --> 02:47:01.430]  Those that aren't living below ground in pressurized facilities.
[02:47:02.188 --> 02:47:07.114]  They got stuff on the shelf that will kill people by specific genose subtypes.
[02:47:08.496 --> 02:47:12.020]  They got stuff that will kill a Belgian, but won't kill your average German.
[02:47:12.421 --> 02:47:15.685]  But if that German's mama was a Belgian, he's gonna be dead.
[02:47:17.071 --> 02:47:25.999]  They got stuff that will kill Arabs, but won't kill a Jew unless they've got more than half Semitic blood in them.
[02:47:26.099 --> 02:47:28.481]  So 80 plus percent of the Jews would live and survive.
[02:47:28.501 --> 02:47:29.842]  80 plus percent are not truly Semitic.
[02:47:30.322 --> 02:47:31.683]  And then they openly talk about this.
[02:47:31.723 --> 02:47:34.886]  I mean, we're here at the edge of total destruction.
[02:47:35.086 --> 02:47:36.688]  And I don't mean some fake Cold War
[02:47:40.487 --> 02:47:42.610]  Mumbo-jumbo about the Russians are going to nuke us.
[02:47:42.690 --> 02:47:43.391]  It was all staged.
[02:47:43.811 --> 02:47:49.217]  I mean, they got real bioweapons and they're openly discussing and considering when they're going to use them on us.
[02:47:52.341 --> 02:47:57.727]  And I just want people to know as this stuff happens, frankly, most of us right now are dead.
[02:47:58.453 --> 02:48:00.535]  We're dead already, and you just better realize that.
[02:48:00.895 --> 02:48:03.657]  There's a small chance God will give us some reprieve.
[02:48:03.697 --> 02:48:09.761]  Even if you're secular, there's a small chance that the elite will back off and stop it, but I don't see that.
[02:48:09.781 --> 02:48:17.647]  These people, most of them are 75 years old, heart problems, who are completely decadent and love death, and are just total scum.
[02:48:18.988 --> 02:48:20.049]  And they're nuts.
[02:48:20.829 --> 02:48:22.190]  They're absolutely nuts.
[02:48:25.871 --> 02:48:29.995]  My God, folks, if you studied what I studied, you'd understand why I can't even tell you.
[02:48:30.436 --> 02:48:32.137]  I can't even explain it, it's so big and bad.
[02:48:32.157 --> 02:48:34.800]  I mean, it's just off the charts.
[02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:36.501]  That's the word, off the charts.
[02:48:37.162 --> 02:48:38.103]  It's off the charts.
[02:48:46.002 --> 02:48:51.484]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:51.844 --> 02:48:59.506]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:00.186 --> 02:49:07.248]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:07.628 --> 02:49:14.590]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[02:49:15.006 --> 02:49:19.049]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:19.349 --> 02:49:22.832]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:23.312 --> 02:49:25.273]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:25.573 --> 02:49:29.516]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:42.865 --> 02:50:47.128]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:50:47.389 --> 02:50:52.212]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:50:52.472 --> 02:50:53.834]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:53.994 --> 02:50:57.496]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:51:20.308 --> 02:51:21.889]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[02:51:35.072 --> 02:51:41.693]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:51:52.896 --> 02:51:57.037]  All I've tried to do is tell you the truth.
[02:51:59.797 --> 02:52:04.058]  All I've attempted to do was research as best I could and find out the truth.
[02:52:05.703 --> 02:52:07.405]  And I get deeper into the truth every day.
[02:52:07.425 --> 02:52:10.907]  We weren't wrong about our analysis in the past.
[02:52:10.947 --> 02:52:18.934]  We just underestimated just how dire things are, just how far along they are, just how serious they are.
[02:52:21.076 --> 02:52:22.317]  And I'm going to tell you something right now.
[02:52:23.618 --> 02:52:25.119]  And I can tell you this with all certainty.
[02:52:26.340 --> 02:52:28.982]  The gravy train is ending.
[02:52:31.104 --> 02:52:33.546]  And if you don't get involved now,
[02:52:35.166 --> 02:52:40.208]  If you don't speak up now, if you don't fight the new world order now, we don't have any hope.
[02:52:42.668 --> 02:52:43.889]  I know that much.
[02:52:44.869 --> 02:52:54.972]  I know we've got loaded phones lined with Josh and Brandon and many others that are patiently holding here.
[02:52:55.152 --> 02:52:57.953]  I just look at the articles of the last week.
[02:52:58.033 --> 02:53:01.794]  Proof Bin Laden tape is five years old, re-release footage, documented, admitted.
[02:53:03.001 --> 02:53:04.843]  Bush administration officials thought W.C.D.
[02:53:04.863 --> 02:53:06.724]  Towers were charged, his biographer.
[02:53:07.645 --> 02:53:10.927]  Former Reagan official, Bush may stage false flag terror, reinstate the draft.
[02:53:11.848 --> 02:53:23.798]  And now Bush has told Congress that, told Congress, that they're not allowed to see the continuity of government martial law plans.
[02:53:23.898 --> 02:53:25.479]  And that's mainstream news.
[02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:27.441]  That is martial law.
[02:53:28.381 --> 02:53:31.424]  Then I got another article here, Bush signed an executive order when Congress
[02:53:32.344 --> 02:53:35.588]  Passed a law saying no more mercury in vaccines.
[02:53:36.048 --> 02:53:39.111]  First off, remember five years ago they told you they took the mercury out.
[02:53:39.592 --> 02:53:40.773]  First they said there was no mercury.
[02:53:40.793 --> 02:53:41.914]  Remember six, seven years ago.
[02:53:42.155 --> 02:53:43.837]  You can plot and chronicle all this.
[02:53:44.357 --> 02:53:45.558]  You can chart it.
[02:53:46.119 --> 02:53:47.801]  First they said there was no mercury.
[02:53:48.590 --> 02:53:51.011]  Then they said there was mercury and it was good for you.
[02:53:51.431 --> 02:53:53.072]  Then they said they took the mercury out.
[02:53:53.392 --> 02:53:55.333]  Now they said mercury was good for you again.
[02:53:55.794 --> 02:53:59.255]  Then they said they took it out again, and you notice it's in every major vaccine.
[02:53:59.796 --> 02:54:12.562]  What the federal regulator said was that companies should, if they want, that they're encouraged to, there's not even a strong regulation, to create lots available that don't have thimerosal in them.
[02:54:12.582 --> 02:54:12.962]  Eli Lilly.
[02:54:14.863 --> 02:54:15.844]  Where is it in my stack?
[02:54:15.884 --> 02:54:16.364]  I had it here.
[02:54:18.829 --> 02:54:22.251]  And so, I should have spent all day on this article alone.
[02:54:22.311 --> 02:54:23.712]  It was over the weekend.
[02:54:23.732 --> 02:54:25.374]  It's up on Infowars.net.
[02:54:27.275 --> 02:54:28.556]  And the great work of Steve Watson.
[02:54:31.858 --> 02:54:35.500]  And Bush just comes right out and says, no, we're going to keep the mercury in.
[02:54:36.621 --> 02:54:41.244]  Folks, they know full well that has brain damaged millions and millions of our boys.
[02:54:42.825 --> 02:54:45.087]  And then the media goes, but see, it's genetic.
[02:54:46.272 --> 02:54:53.577]  Boys, ladies and gentlemen, those boys don't have the gene, or it's inactive, that allows it to pass the blood-brain barrier.
[02:54:54.637 --> 02:54:57.779]  It is a gene sequence that's off in many males.
[02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:00.721]  And it also correlates to the age of the male.
[02:55:01.021 --> 02:55:05.984]  The truth is it's a problem with sperm, generally in men over 40 years of age or men who have used drugs.
[02:55:06.364 --> 02:55:08.385]  But that only adds to it.
[02:55:08.445 --> 02:55:14.209]  That is some of the cases, but the vast majority are caused by the mercury.
[02:55:16.255 --> 02:55:22.978]  And it usually expresses in boys that already have the absorption problem, who absorb too much of it.
[02:55:23.598 --> 02:55:28.940]  And it's the same gene that affects tissues in the gut that block out toxins.
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:30.741]  I don't know, it gets real complex.
[02:55:30.781 --> 02:55:32.942]  I've spent many, many days studying it over the years.
[02:55:34.262 --> 02:55:42.485]  We've got that story, and of course the big one of the day, and this one really upset me this weekend.
[02:55:42.506 --> 02:55:43.386]  I mean, this is serious.
[02:55:44.202 --> 02:55:49.403]  The Bush-Marshall Law Plan is so shocking, even Congress can't see it.
[02:55:50.983 --> 02:55:54.364]  Now, that's the biggin', and I hope you get it out to everybody.
[02:55:54.424 --> 02:55:56.844]  It's oninfowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:55:57.225 --> 02:56:02.305]  Big report coming out on one of the FEMA Deputy Directors being confronted by We Are Change.
[02:56:02.325 --> 02:56:03.306]  Just incredible folks.
[02:56:05.366 --> 02:56:06.626]  Just an amazing job.
[02:56:06.646 --> 02:56:07.406]  They're on fire.
[02:56:07.466 --> 02:56:09.987]  That's the type of leadership we need to see from all of you right now.
[02:56:11.288 --> 02:56:14.809]  They're just on fire confronting FEMA on the camps and Building 7.
[02:56:15.349 --> 02:56:17.090]  That'll be up on Jones Report in the next few hours.
[02:56:17.850 --> 02:56:18.690]  God bless you all.
