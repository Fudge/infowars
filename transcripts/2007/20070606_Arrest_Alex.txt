[00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:02.839]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:04.242]  Welcome.
[00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:04.903]  Here we are.
[00:00:04.903 --> 00:00:06.727]  It is the sixth day of June 2007.
[00:00:06.727 --> 00:00:09.634]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:13.104 --> 00:00:16.406]  Senator Sessions has finally gotten a copy of the complete bill.
[00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:19.528]  It's even semi-secret from high-ranking senators.
[00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:22.510]  It is total, absolute mega-amnesty.
[00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.733]  The worst ever, even worse than we thought from the subsections that we've gotten.
[00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:31.856]  We'll be going over the 20 total loopholes, the end of America, in the second hour.
[00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:32.917]  In the first hour!
[00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:53.508]  Matt Lepasic, reporting for InfoWars.com and WeAreChange.org, with Luke Rudowsky and Michael Narb, were at the Republican debates last night in New Hampshire, in the big media gymnasium area, separate from the debates.
[00:00:53.508 --> 00:01:01.993]  They went in, said who they were with, got CNN press passes, they were letting, you know, small newspapers, TV stations, all over the country, didn't matter, Big Ten,
[00:01:02.927 --> 00:01:20.824]  They went in and they asked serious follow-up questions to Rudolph Giuliani's minions about the two separate times in the last two weeks where they confronted him in New York and surrounding areas, politely as well, asking him about his comments that he was told Tower One and Two were going to fall.
[00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:21.945]  He then denied it.
[00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:26.249]  We have played, of course, the national television program Giuliani was on with
[00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:36.037]  The now, of course, deceased anchor of ABC News, Peter Jennings, he also said it in front of the 9-11 Commission.
[00:01:36.037 --> 00:01:40.381]  And his head pollster said, no, it's a lie, you don't have any documentation.
[00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:44.003]  And then the press secretary was there in the crowd and ran off.
[00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.606]  We have this from eyewitnesses and I was watching a live video cam feed.
[00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:52.370]  It's not on the main video feed that's out there on the web.
[00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.490]  And
[00:01:53.599 --> 00:02:05.505]  They went and got the police and the state police came in and arrested Matt LePacek and charged him with criminal trespass, ladies and gentlemen, which depending on how they apply, it could be a felony or a misdemeanor.
[00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:08.327]  He has since now gotten out of jail in the early morning.
[00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:10.111]  Hours.
[00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:20.597]  It was historical because they had wireless internet via a cell phone hooked up to the laptop and when they took his camera away and unplugged it, he still had the audio separately hooked into the laptop.
[00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:24.900]  That went out for about five minutes in the squad car.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.441]  The only question is, were we able to save it?
[00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:29.402]  I was watching it at home as it happened.
[00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:31.663]  It was cutting in and out because of buffering issues.
[00:02:31.663 --> 00:02:34.945]  So many people trying to watch it, which we were worried about.
[00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:36.826]  But for other people, it wasn't buffering.
[00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:37.787]  They were able to see it.
[00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:46.816]  So I saw a lot of this live from the camera that he was holding in his hand, one of the Infowars cameras that we donated.
[00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:48.038]  Just absolutely amazing.
[00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:49.840]  We have Matt LePacek with us.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.885]  When we get back in the second segment, we're going straight to him.
[00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:55.787]  It is on the front page of the Drudge Report.
[00:02:56.816 --> 00:02:59.777]  It is on the front page of Dig.
[00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:01.598]  It has gotten massive attention.
[00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:02.838]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:04.259]  Go to JonesReport.com.
[00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:11.942]  We stayed up here until 2 in the morning writing this article and expanding it and putting it out last night about the incredible tyranny that everyone's witnessing.
[00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:17.055]  And I haven't discovered who put the video up on the web yet.
[00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:22.957]  I was thinking it would take, you know, until today to get somebody with all these cameras to get the video up.
[00:03:22.957 --> 00:03:33.042]  It is somebody uploaded it and it is up on the Drudge Report all over the place right now.
[00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:37.764]  So we're going to be breaking all this down coming up in the
[00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:40.094]  Next segment.
[00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:41.615]  This is huge news.
[00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:44.676]  We also have Ron Paul's campaign popping in.
[00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:51.981]  At the first debate, and this has been timed out, one candidate got 16 minutes, but another candidate only got five and a half.
[00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.602]  Last night it was the same thing.
[00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:59.265]  The first half of the debate was just three of the ten people.
[00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:00.246]  These are staged debates.
[00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:01.586]  This has never happened before.
[00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:03.948]  That's huge news.
[00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:06.629]  We've got open talk of strikes on Iran.
[00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:07.710]  Wall-to-wall bedlam.
[00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:21.495]  We'll be right back with Matt Lepacek, Luke Rudowsky, and the rest of the WeAreChangeInfoWars.com team.
[00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:22.196]  It's here.
[00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:27.337]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:34.980]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:43.132]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:54.856]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:58.837]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:04:58.837 --> 00:05:01.098]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:01.098 --> 00:05:04.939]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:22.090]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:31.552]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:06:31.552 --> 00:06:38.634]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:45.366]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:06:56.936 --> 00:06:59.519]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.140]  For more information, call 702-953-ZERO.
[00:07:03.442 --> 00:07:11.630]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.392]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:38.499]  We've got the Ron Paul campaign popping in today in the aftermath of another stage debate that he still won in every major poll.
[00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:41.481]  I've looked and it's got to be more than 20, including the CNN poll.
[00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:43.102]  He's winning right now at 56%.
[00:07:43.102 --> 00:07:48.306]  It is Wednesday, the 6th day of June 2007.
[00:07:48.306 --> 00:07:53.970]  Senator Sessions releases a list of 20 loopholes in the Senate Immigration Bill.
[00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.971]  Huge news.
[00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:56.592]  It's worse than we even thought.
[00:07:57.475 --> 00:07:59.776]  It's worse than I even reported.
[00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:02.857]  You know, I get accused all the time of exaggerating.
[00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:04.298]  No, I do my homework.
[00:08:04.298 --> 00:08:06.959]  We happen to know how dire the straits are.
[00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:11.281]  Frankly, in almost every case, I underestimate or I under-report.
[00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:14.222]  Okay?
[00:08:14.222 --> 00:08:15.903]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:08:15.903 --> 00:08:18.204]  So that's coming up.
[00:08:18.204 --> 00:08:20.465]  Let me just read part of this article, then we're going to go to him.
[00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:23.046]  Reporter arrested on orders of Giuliani Press Secretary.
[00:08:24.384 --> 00:08:27.786]  Now, again, we know that his head press people were there.
[00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:36.031]  They were Matt Lepesek and others, Luke Rudowsky and others were questioning, and even mainline media was going, those are good questions, and were bringing up Ron Paul to him first.
[00:08:36.031 --> 00:08:44.936]  They, of course, then accused some older gentleman who was with a major publication of being with our people.
[00:08:44.936 --> 00:08:46.737]  If anybody brought up Ron Paul, they got mad.
[00:08:46.737 --> 00:08:48.758]  This went on and on and on and on.
[00:08:48.758 --> 00:08:51.440]  I was watching it on the live link at WeAreChanged.org.
[00:08:53.054 --> 00:08:57.735]  I'd get to watch a minute, then it would cut out for a minute because so many people were hitting it.
[00:08:57.735 --> 00:09:05.457]  But a reporter arrested on orders of Giuliani, and then Matt Lepacek says, you know, we've questioned Giuliani twice in the last few weeks.
[00:09:05.457 --> 00:09:17.081]  He says he didn't say that the towers, that he got word that they were going to fall before they did, but he told Peter Jennings, he told C-SPAN, we're going to play this audio later after our guests are gone, but it's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now if you want to see it.
[00:09:20.814 --> 00:09:25.097]  Then he says, back off, and starts walking away.
[00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:29.280]  But they were just asking him the questions.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.022]  And by then, his people had already scurried off to get the state police.
[00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:38.466]  They came over and grabbed Luke, grabbed Matt, grabbed some other people, dug them outside.
[00:09:38.466 --> 00:09:42.869]  Now, Matt, I talked to people that were in the line with Matt when he went up and said who he was with.
[00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:46.305]  And they gave them CNN press passes.
[00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:47.365]  Everybody got those.
[00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:50.027]  It took special passers to get into the debate hall.
[00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:53.029]  This was outside of an auditorium across the street.
[00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:57.331]  This was a big facility with hundreds and hundreds of reporters.
[00:09:57.331 --> 00:09:59.093]  This was a big overflow.
[00:09:59.093 --> 00:10:02.255]  I mean, if you were writing for the local Five and Dime, you could get in.
[00:10:02.255 --> 00:10:04.296]  You know, the local Green Sheet.
[00:10:04.296 --> 00:10:06.057]  Anybody who said they were media got in.
[00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:19.782]  They got CNN press passes, and they ran up to him and CNN, to their credit, went outside and said, don't arrest Luke, don't arrest Matt, don't arrest these people, we issued press passes.
[00:10:19.782 --> 00:10:22.043]  And the state police said, we don't care.
[00:10:22.043 --> 00:10:27.426]  The complaint was made by Giuliani's people, he's going to jail, we're putting charges on him.
[00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:34.851]  Now, they've gotten so cavalier about these false charges, they then went on to say, we may charge you with espionage,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.061]  We may charge you for having a hidden camera.
[00:10:38.061 --> 00:10:39.381]  Nothing hidden about it.
[00:10:39.381 --> 00:10:44.243]  They have the microphone in their hand, they have another handheld camera, and they have the other camera as backup to the laptop.
[00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:48.844]  In fact, he's up there in their face saying, we're transmitting this live over the internet.
[00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:51.425]  There's other live cameras there for national television.
[00:10:51.425 --> 00:10:55.746]  It's a building filled with hundreds, and I mean, there probably was 500 press there.
[00:10:55.746 --> 00:10:57.527]  Just giant throngs.
[00:10:57.527 --> 00:11:04.009]  This is the Republican debates, the third, in New Hampshire, the key battleground state.
[00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:05.309]  All of this is going on.
[00:11:07.532 --> 00:11:21.461]  And then the sickest thing on Dig, and on my message board, and on 9-11 blogger, I was looking and there are people on there saying, good, arrest them all, I'm sick of these 9-11 truthers, they deserve it, Alex Jones deserves to be arrested.
[00:11:21.461 --> 00:11:24.023]  Talking about when I asked Bush a question and he had me arrested.
[00:11:24.023 --> 00:11:26.945]  Almost broke my arm off, the state police did.
[00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:29.707]  I mean, this is the new America!
[00:11:29.707 --> 00:11:32.368]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to Matt Lepacek.
[00:11:32.368 --> 00:11:35.671]  They didn't charge him with espionage, as if he worked for a foreign government.
[00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:36.111]  No, he works for
[00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:38.745]  The American people.
[00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:45.367]  And they told him that we could charge you for having a hidden camera.
[00:11:45.367 --> 00:11:54.009]  No, that's if you had a hidden camera in a bathroom, or a hidden camera in somebody's house, or a hidden camera that isn't in a public place, okay?
[00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:58.531]  I've read the laws, federal and state, and international as well, and let me just give it to you.
[00:11:58.531 --> 00:12:02.592]  If you're in an area which does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy,
[00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:08.054]  Those laws don't apply, you lying pieces of trash.
[00:12:08.054 --> 00:12:14.256]  You don't go to a football game and say if somebody's got a camera and you're not allowed to tape them.
[00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:23.439]  You don't go to a gigantic press circus with huge TV cameras everywhere and say you're not allowed to videotape me.
[00:12:23.439 --> 00:12:28.121]  And all over the nation, I've had cops walk up to me and say, you're not allowed to tape me, that's eavesdropping, I'm gonna arrest you.
[00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:30.421]  I go, go ahead, it's First Amendment, I'm gonna sue you.
[00:12:30.421 --> 00:12:32.462]  You may beat the rep, you're not gonna beat the ride, pal.
[00:12:34.056 --> 00:12:40.685]  And I'm going to sue them, and they know it, they look right in my eyes, and they decide I'm going to leave this person alone.
[00:12:40.685 --> 00:12:47.293]  You think you're... and I watched this big state trooper shoving them down, they were physically attacked, Luke and Matt.
[00:12:47.293 --> 00:12:51.899]  It was supposedly even worse once they got outside, this big thug in his Marine Corps drill sergeant hat.
[00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.720]  You know, they love killing America.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.521]  They love hating this country.
[00:12:56.521 --> 00:12:59.744]  They love shoving us around and working for the New World Order.
[00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:01.004]  They enjoy it.
[00:13:01.004 --> 00:13:03.646]  And don't think for a minute they won't man the FEMA camps.
[00:13:03.646 --> 00:13:06.008]  Don't think for a minute they won't come and take your guns.
[00:13:06.008 --> 00:13:10.330]  Don't think for a minute they don't want to play Jack Bauer on you and your family.
[00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.291]  Alright, Matt LePacek!
[00:13:11.912 --> 00:13:13.713]  Thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[00:13:13.713 --> 00:13:20.217]  By the way, let's call Ron Paul's press secretary and let's see if we can get him on at about 40 after to the 30 after, so I have time with these guys.
[00:13:20.217 --> 00:13:23.899]  If not, I'll just hold them for five minutes when their guy comes on and hold them in the next hour.
[00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:25.900]  Matt Lepacek, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.940]  Hello, Super Patriot.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.001]  Alex Jones, how you doing, sir?
[00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:36.106]  No, you are the Super Patriot, and you guys are on just an absolute rampage of liberty and freedom engaging these people.
[00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:36.706]  Al Gore,
[00:13:37.581 --> 00:13:47.169]  John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani twice, Hillary Clinton, one of our reporters, just two days ago, got physically assaulted and thrown out for asking Hillary a question.
[00:13:47.169 --> 00:13:48.610]  We haven't even done a report on that.
[00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.731]  You guys have done so much.
[00:13:49.731 --> 00:13:52.053]  David Rockefeller, confronted.
[00:13:52.053 --> 00:13:58.778]  Police walking up to you guys and saying, we're going to say you've got bombs on you, if you don't leave and stop protesting at Ground Zero.
[00:13:58.778 --> 00:14:02.401]  Open frame-ups, total wickedness, all on video.
[00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:04.843]  You are incredible, but listen, I'm excited, I'm going to try to shut up.
[00:14:05.343 --> 00:14:14.050]  Describe exactly what happened last night, because obviously your eyes and ears and other people that witness things can describe it even better than the video, which is riveting.
[00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.211]  Alright, I'm trying to bear with me here.
[00:14:15.211 --> 00:14:16.692]  We're going on a bit of sleep.
[00:14:16.692 --> 00:14:21.215]  We had a four-hour trip back here from New Hampshire yesterday evening, but here we go.
[00:14:21.215 --> 00:14:23.637]  As you said earlier, we were there.
[00:14:23.637 --> 00:14:26.179]  We had CNN press pass, CNN credentials.
[00:14:26.179 --> 00:14:28.581]  We went to the press pass office.
[00:14:28.581 --> 00:14:33.825]  We spoke to the woman in person on the Sunday when we were there for a Democratic debate, and we received contacts.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:40.703]  We then later contacted that person on the, um, Tuesday morning and secured our press passes.
[00:14:40.703 --> 00:14:55.571]  Went down to CNN, went down to, um, I think it was Saint, I forget the name of the college over there, Saint Anselm College, where they were holding debates over there, and, um, what they call Manchester, New Hampshire, which is really, uh, Gofftown, New Hampshire.
[00:14:55.571 --> 00:15:02.374]  Anyhow, so we're inside the spin room, as they appropriately have named it, and
[00:15:03.223 --> 00:15:04.003]  We're waiting around.
[00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:09.364]  We've got Sam and we've got Jason Bermes and a couple other guys out there who's changed people.
[00:15:09.364 --> 00:15:11.044]  Luke Podolsky, myself.
[00:15:11.044 --> 00:15:12.565]  We've got our guys Mike Barr.
[00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:23.867]  We've got Mir and Brian and Oscar and a whole bunch of other guys sitting in the Truth Mobile 1 over there in the RV that we had taken up there with us.
[00:15:23.867 --> 00:15:29.948]  And we're inside, waiting around, and all of a sudden we're expecting the candidates to come out.
[00:15:30.737 --> 00:15:44.184]  Now, we have been there over there on Sunday, covering the Democratic debate, and we've got some excellent footage on that, which I don't know if you guys have talked about yet, but we were aware that the big candidates aren't really coming into the spin room.
[00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:50.747]  They're either being flown immediately out, or they're going to their private parties, and we had actually RSVP'd that evening for Rudy Giuliani's party.
[00:15:50.747 --> 00:15:53.989]  We didn't have an opportunity to make it over there, as it seems.
[00:15:53.989 --> 00:15:59.592]  So we were well prepared for the event that the main candidate, you know, Giuliani,
[00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:18.226]  And some of the other frontrunners over there around me, we're not going to actually... And let's get into what actually happened to you and when they took you to jail, and I heard you were pretty concerned when you got your one phone call out to the guys at Truth One, back to the RV, that they were talking about moving you, other charges.
[00:16:18.226 --> 00:16:18.926]  Let's get into it.
[00:16:20.174 --> 00:16:22.155]  So basically, we have a representative come out there.
[00:16:22.155 --> 00:16:23.195]  I don't even know his name.
[00:16:23.195 --> 00:16:24.796]  He represented Rudy Giuliani.
[00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:26.016]  Two or three questions get asked.
[00:16:26.016 --> 00:16:27.917]  The question right before me was Sam Matero.
[00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:29.317]  It's his pollster.
[00:16:29.317 --> 00:16:30.478]  It's a national pollster.
[00:16:30.478 --> 00:16:32.218]  But his press secretary was there in the crowd.
[00:16:32.218 --> 00:16:34.819]  We've got witnesses that ran off and made the report.
[00:16:34.819 --> 00:16:36.540]  Or it was his acting press secretary.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.340]  But go ahead.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.501]  Well, there was a question that there was prior to mine, which I can't even recount.
[00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:42.402]  You'll have to look at the video to see it.
[00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:44.782]  And they spun it, and they would not answer the question.
[00:16:44.782 --> 00:16:47.403]  And we were interjecting, saying, sir, please answer the question.
[00:16:47.403 --> 00:16:48.884]  All of a sudden, here it is, my opportunity.
[00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.787]  You guys are looking at me directly in the face.
[00:16:51.787 --> 00:16:54.429]  And we did the same thing, which you guys keep hearing the same question.
[00:16:54.429 --> 00:16:58.073]  You know, we confronted him on Tuesday at Seashore Restaurant.
[00:16:58.073 --> 00:17:01.777]  He appeared on an ABC video interview with Peter Jennings.
[00:17:01.777 --> 00:17:05.761]  Giuliani admitted that the World Trade Center said he had foreknowns they were going to collapse.
[00:17:05.761 --> 00:17:09.345]  Then that Tuesday morning, when we went there at Seashore Restaurant,
[00:17:10.054 --> 00:17:15.337]  He told us that he never made such a statement, and that he did not have $4.
[00:17:15.337 --> 00:17:23.561]  The gentleman said that, you know, I would like to see that video, or something to that effect, and I said, sir, I have it open right here in my bag, if you'd like, we can go sit down and take a look at it right now.
[00:17:23.561 --> 00:17:29.644]  He was acknowledging me for the fact that he was... And then he yells, back off, and you start backing off, and the police come and arrest you.
[00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:30.557]  Indeed.
[00:17:30.557 --> 00:17:33.659]  And I can't even recount because I haven't watched the video myself.
[00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:36.561]  And of course he says back off and you see his people run.
[00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:37.122]  They're behind him.
[00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.903]  You can see them suddenly move away.
[00:17:38.903 --> 00:17:41.024]  They run and go, Oh my God!
[00:17:41.024 --> 00:17:42.345]  It's one of them!
[00:17:42.345 --> 00:17:46.748]  And the state police big ol' guy comes over and just, you're a pretty tall guy yourself, and just, Rah!
[00:17:46.748 --> 00:17:47.208]  Pushes you.
[00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:48.729]  Get out of here, boy!
[00:17:48.729 --> 00:17:49.970]  Yeah, they were warning me in advance.
[00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.491]  They were saying, Oh, if that's enough, that's enough.
[00:17:51.491 --> 00:17:54.493]  And all we're doing is we're pressing the question because he's still engaging us, okay?
[00:17:54.986 --> 00:18:00.734]  We were in the middle of engaging a question, when I had gentlemen put their hands on me, three of them, and drag me out.
[00:18:00.734 --> 00:18:05.401]  And I was later told that Luke Brodowski, who later said, Hey, what are you doing?
[00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:06.503]  He didn't do anything.
[00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.466]  He was later dragged out by Mirror Association.
[00:18:09.033 --> 00:18:15.177]  So, um, it was a wink and a nod, it happened for the press secretary, and that's when I was outside, I tried to clarify, who kicked me out?
[00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:16.658]  If it was CNN!
[00:18:16.658 --> 00:18:25.263]  You've gotta, and let me explain law, we actually, I have it in front of me, we actually pulled up New Hampshire law, we pulled up the code, I have it here in front of me, it's the same as Texas or any other state.
[00:18:25.863 --> 00:18:26.224]  Yes, I do.
[00:18:46.005 --> 00:18:52.126]  Then you have to be warned to leave if you were first invited, and then if you don't leave, they can get you on trespass.
[00:18:52.126 --> 00:18:53.366]  They didn't do this!
[00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:58.927]  Those police are criminals, and I call for their indictment on official oppression!
[00:18:58.927 --> 00:19:00.988]  I want them arrested!
[00:19:00.988 --> 00:19:03.888]  They are enemies of the Republic!
[00:19:03.888 --> 00:19:06.629]  They are treasonous demons!
[00:19:06.629 --> 00:19:10.169]  They are enemies of the very soul of this Republic!
[00:19:10.169 --> 00:19:14.110]  And all of our veterans, all of our founding fathers are spinning in their graves.
[00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.990]  Stay with me, Matt!
[00:19:18.798 --> 00:19:24.061]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:39.172]  Percent of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[00:20:39.172 --> 00:20:42.893]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels switching dollar to yen.
[00:20:42.893 --> 00:20:44.574]  Bad news for US currency.
[00:20:44.574 --> 00:20:46.895]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[00:20:46.895 --> 00:20:48.296]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[00:20:48.576 --> 00:20:50.797]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro.
[00:20:50.797 --> 00:20:52.057]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:20:52.057 --> 00:20:54.778]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[00:20:54.778 --> 00:20:56.859]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[00:20:56.859 --> 00:20:59.559]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:00.640]  Why attack Iran?
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.681]  Jerome O. Corsi's Iran leads attack against the U.S.
[00:21:03.681 --> 00:21:05.261]  dollar document spells it out.

[00:21:07.762 --> 00:21:11.423]  The value of your hard earned money is being destroyed in a global game of chess.

[00:21:18.032 --> 00:21:23.016]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:21:23.016 --> 00:21:26.259]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:21:26.259 --> 00:21:29.202]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:21:29.202 --> 00:21:34.406]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:21:34.406 --> 00:21:40.071]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:21:40.071 --> 00:21:43.034]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:21:43.214 --> 00:21:43.794]  We're good to go.
[00:22:06.624 --> 00:22:11.987]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.

[00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:13.928]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer!
[00:22:13.928 --> 00:22:16.089]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[00:22:25.965 --> 00:22:27.606]  For a while, anyway.
[00:22:27.606 --> 00:22:31.388]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[00:22:31.388 --> 00:22:34.029]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:37.871]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:22:37.871 --> 00:22:40.692]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:41.793]  What's the name again?
[00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:43.194]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:22:43.194 --> 00:22:44.354]  It's CalX.
[00:22:44.354 --> 00:22:45.295]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:22:46.861 --> 00:22:48.742]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:58.084]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:22:58.084 --> 00:23:02.865]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:12.688]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:23:12.688 --> 00:23:13.848]  Hey, there's a drug store.
[00:23:13.848 --> 00:23:14.769]  I'll be right back.
[00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:15.709]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[00:23:18.459 --> 00:23:20.180]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:40.760]  We're good to go.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.343]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:08.206]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[00:24:08.206 --> 00:24:10.507]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever.
[00:24:10.507 --> 00:24:12.209]  Picture me buying this scam.
[00:24:12.209 --> 00:24:13.430]  I said never.
[00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.092]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting.
[00:24:16.092 --> 00:24:17.533]  I stay committed, give or take.
[00:24:17.533 --> 00:24:18.714]  Die or lose commission.
[00:24:18.714 --> 00:24:21.356]  It's all a part of fighting devil state mind control.
[00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:23.918]  And all about the battle for your body, mind and soul.
[00:24:23.918 --> 00:24:26.681]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you.
[00:24:26.681 --> 00:24:28.262]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us everything.
[00:24:28.442 --> 00:24:29.643]  I know we're crazed.
[00:24:29.643 --> 00:24:33.045]  I know you see a lot of energy in us and we seem like maniacs.
[00:24:33.045 --> 00:24:42.471]  We should respond with anger and force and energy to total corruption, our country being overrun, criminal police everywhere feeding on everyone.
[00:24:43.536 --> 00:24:48.679]  Let's go back to Matt, who was literally kidnapped by the state police and taken to jail.
[00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:50.640]  Matt, what happened once they grabbed you?
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.281]  Describe it blow-by-blow for us.
[00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:54.503]  Then we're going to get Luke Rodowski and others.
[00:24:54.503 --> 00:24:56.384]  I'm going to keep you guys on into the next hour.
[00:24:56.384 --> 00:24:57.465]  This is so important.
[00:24:57.465 --> 00:25:01.227]  We're going to have Ron Paul people pop in in just a moment for a few minutes first, but go ahead.
[00:25:01.227 --> 00:25:04.969]  And please speed me along here if I go too slowly because I'm a playwright.
[00:25:04.969 --> 00:25:06.830]  I understand you basically had no sleep.
[00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.791]  You're exhausted.
[00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:09.732]  Just turbo up and tell the story.
[00:25:09.732 --> 00:25:12.454]  Okay, so basically we're asking the question and all of a sudden
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:33.632]  I got people behind me, and they grab me, turn me around, I have my hand, they are holding on to my body, forcing me forward, you know, I'm walking along with them, I'm making statements publicly, making sure not to scream, but to say loudly and calmly I'm being escorted out of this premises for asking the Reverend Rudy Giuliani the question, okay?
[00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:35.714]  Making similar declarations such as that.
[00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:43.313]  Going all the way outside, the officers finally take me to the staircase, where I'm escorted out of the building, and they let me go.
[00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:44.134]  Okay?
[00:25:44.134 --> 00:25:45.437]  And they said, you have to leave.
[00:25:45.437 --> 00:25:46.379]  Okay?
[00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:47.201]  So I did that, and I said,
[00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:51.916]  For the most part, under whose authority am I being forced to leave?
[00:25:51.916 --> 00:25:53.837]  You can watch the video to see exactly what I said.
[00:25:53.837 --> 00:25:58.820]  So you weren't supposed to talk to the gods, that's them claiming then that it was trespass?
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:06.745]  Well, no, what actually happened here is that I asked them, okay, under whose authority here am I actually being, is my trespass voided, you know?
[00:26:07.245 --> 00:26:09.586]  Is it just because of your discretion you decided to remove me?
[00:26:09.586 --> 00:26:10.847]  You know, I'm a press pass.
[00:26:10.847 --> 00:26:14.329]  If that press pass is not avoided, it's your discretion of which you're choosing to do.
[00:26:14.329 --> 00:26:18.251]  But now talking back in Soviet America sends you to the gulag.
[00:26:18.251 --> 00:26:19.872]  That's forwarding, yeah, exactly.
[00:26:19.872 --> 00:26:23.534]  So I say to them, you know, you're not providing to me any information here.
[00:26:23.534 --> 00:26:25.055]  If I walk past you right now, is that me?
[00:26:25.055 --> 00:26:26.016]  I'm going to get arrested.
[00:26:26.016 --> 00:26:28.497]  And I say, okay, sir, I'm going to walk past you.
[00:26:28.914 --> 00:26:32.757]  And sure enough, I get arrested, and they say, this is what you wanted, this is what you wanted, you know, is that what I wanted?
[00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:50.110]  I wanted clarification, I wanted to stand up for my rights, and know what the heck is going on, and they never told me... Yeah, they've already put us in free speech zones, they've already restricted us, they're doing all this criminal stuff, you've got an official press pass, then Luke told me that at that point, CNN got involved, saying, no, please don't arrest him, what happened then?
[00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:54.372]  Yes, you know, I heard someone from CNN getting the police officer's attention.
[00:26:54.372 --> 00:26:58.214]  I don't know exactly what they said, but nevertheless, then I was, you know, escorted.
[00:26:58.214 --> 00:26:59.455]  That's because they know they're liable.
[00:26:59.455 --> 00:27:01.956]  You didn't do anything, and they gave you those passes.
[00:27:01.956 --> 00:27:03.337]  You were unbelievable.
[00:27:03.337 --> 00:27:05.398]  Handcuffs, you know, right there on the front gate.
[00:27:05.398 --> 00:27:06.898]  You know, they're saying this is something they wanted.
[00:27:06.898 --> 00:27:09.840]  Did anybody get footage of the handcuffing?
[00:27:10.871 --> 00:27:12.332]  You know, I'm not entirely certain.
[00:27:12.332 --> 00:27:14.374]  We haven't reviewed any of the footage yet.
[00:27:14.374 --> 00:27:21.980]  Now, I've seen scores of posts who heard the audio once they ripped the camera off of you.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.463]  My internet cut out, but if mine's buffering, other people's wasn't.
[00:27:25.463 --> 00:27:34.210]  And I've seen it, and basically from all these angles, that the audio continued out in the parking lot where they were saying, hey boy, this is what you wanted, do you like it?
[00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.753]  And then comments in the squad car.
[00:27:37.753 --> 00:27:39.514]  That was recorded on the laptop, correct?
[00:27:39.514 --> 00:27:40.295]  Have you gotten that back?
[00:27:40.911 --> 00:27:50.274]  You know, the information, actually, in order to have battery operate, make the battery last as long as possible, we're not doing client-side recording on that notebook.
[00:27:50.274 --> 00:27:56.437]  I'll be contacting the encoders today, Camstream, to see if they can provide it with our... We've got to buy you a bigger battery pack or something.
[00:27:56.437 --> 00:27:57.297]  We've got to get you better gear.
[00:27:57.297 --> 00:28:00.478]  We've got all kinds of stuff we need to get over here, you know, but... Well, here's the next question.
[00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:04.680]  Well, we're going to help you out, and I'm going to help you with your defense, too, and I'm told one of the cameras got damaged.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.880]  Do I need to send more cameras?
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.381]  Well, not only did they get damaged, the camera was dropped.
[00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:12.004]  I didn't see this, but I have several people who have told me it was stepped on, okay?
[00:28:12.004 --> 00:28:14.085]  And the camera right now is inoperable.
[00:28:14.085 --> 00:28:18.188]  So, uh, as well as what happened... So they broke the, they broke one of the Sonys I sent?
[00:28:18.188 --> 00:28:19.890]  Yeah, it just so happened to hit the ground.
[00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:22.412]  We're gonna send you two more for that one.
[00:28:22.412 --> 00:28:28.176]  Just like they broke into your thing and stole your famous 9-11 inside job sign you've had for four years.
[00:28:28.176 --> 00:28:30.298]  We're gonna send you, and then you made two?
[00:28:30.298 --> 00:28:31.859]  You made two of those signs?
[00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:34.201]  We're gonna send you two more cameras.
[00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:34.721]  How's that sound?
[00:28:35.459 --> 00:28:36.399]  You know, whatever else we can do.
[00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:39.640]  I would like to have those people standing up, doing the same thing, going out there.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.240]  That's what we want.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.941]  More than money, more than donations, more than anything we could possibly do in order to change the world.
[00:28:43.941 --> 00:28:45.441]  We need numbers, and to strengthen numbers.
[00:28:45.441 --> 00:28:46.281]  That's what they're afraid of.
[00:28:46.281 --> 00:28:47.522]  They're afraid of our unity.
[00:28:47.522 --> 00:28:50.142]  You know, they can take our heartbeat, but they can't take our soul.
[00:28:50.142 --> 00:28:50.402]  You know?
[00:28:50.402 --> 00:28:56.904]  That's right, and they are afraid of your energy, they're afraid of your will, on your mission.
[00:28:56.904 --> 00:28:57.584]  They're scared.
[00:28:57.584 --> 00:29:02.465]  Their whole police state, the whole tracking grid, is because they're afraid of citizens engaging them.
[00:29:02.865 --> 00:29:04.106]  That's what this is all about.
[00:29:04.106 --> 00:29:05.368]  They are scared.
[00:29:05.368 --> 00:29:09.011]  These thugs are scared!
[00:29:09.011 --> 00:29:10.413]  We're on the march.
[00:29:10.413 --> 00:29:12.935]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:12.935 --> 00:29:15.638]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:18.655 --> 00:29:21.819]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:29:21.819 --> 00:29:27.966]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:29:27.966 --> 00:29:30.288]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:29:30.288 --> 00:29:39.499]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:50.882]  With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[00:29:50.882 --> 00:29:53.943]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[00:29:53.943 --> 00:30:01.265]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.
[00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:02.586]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:30:02.586 --> 00:30:03.727]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:03.727 --> 00:30:06.329]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:06.329 --> 00:30:09.271]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:28.837 --> 00:30:36.143]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:31:03.466 --> 00:31:04.927]  Are you lacking energy on a daily basis?
[00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:06.428]  Do you feel tired all the time?
[00:31:24.659 --> 00:31:28.523]  Then it's time for you to try A.C.T., the healthy energy drink.
[00:31:28.523 --> 00:31:29.084]  A.C.T.

[00:31:34.769 --> 00:31:35.370]  A.C.T.
[00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:39.974]  contains no caffeine, 4 grams of sugar, and only 22 calories per serving.
[00:31:39.974 --> 00:31:40.495]  A.C.T.
[00:31:40.495 --> 00:31:41.336]  works within minutes.
[00:31:41.536 --> 00:31:41.936]  I think so.
[00:32:02.466 --> 00:32:03.467]  That's right.
[00:32:32.179 --> 00:32:36.242]  In the coming days, we're going to analyze this whole thing because it's so important.
[00:32:36.242 --> 00:32:43.326]  We've got emails and calls pouring in from people who did shoot video in the parking lot at the gates.
[00:32:43.326 --> 00:32:46.688]  Other people inside, they're going to be uploading it to YouTube and Google Video.
[00:32:46.688 --> 00:32:54.913]  I also want to get the students for 9-11 Truth on, who shot some of the video, to get their perspective on what happened.
[00:32:56.736 --> 00:33:06.944]  That is in the big green room area where all the media was let in, just asking Giuliani's minions a question about some of his statements.
[00:33:06.944 --> 00:33:12.848]  They ordered the state police to come in and throw him out and arrest him.
[00:33:12.848 --> 00:33:21.435]  We're going to go back to Matt LePacek and Luke Rodowski and others that have gotten back to New York, drove back overnight, here in about 10 minutes, but right now,
[00:33:22.404 --> 00:33:30.047]  Jesse Benton, press secretary, press coordinator for Congressman Ron Paul's presidential run, for the presidency, about the debate.
[00:33:30.047 --> 00:33:35.870]  He's won every major poll, but yet again, Jesse said he hoped yesterday he'd be given equal time.
[00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:40.091]  Ron Paul was literally stuck on the end, in the shadows.
[00:33:40.091 --> 00:33:44.713]  One of my writers, Aaron Dykes, left at about 3 in the morning last night, but today he's going to time it all out.
[00:33:44.713 --> 00:33:47.134]  But in past debates, we've seen 16-minute to 5-minute ratios.
[00:33:49.065 --> 00:33:50.386]  It may even be worse this time.
[00:33:50.386 --> 00:33:53.929]  It appears that three candidates were given about 60 plus percent of the time.
[00:33:53.929 --> 00:33:56.151]  These are rigged debates.
[00:33:56.151 --> 00:34:06.819]  I know you guys don't want to sound like sore losers because you won anyways as underdogs, but it needs to be stated that even in a rigged race, it's like a horse race where it's a 10 lap race and they
[00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:10.112]  Let the other horses get five laps ahead.
[00:34:10.112 --> 00:34:18.154]  They turn Ron Paul loose and he ran circles around them and literally wins by five laps when he was five laps behind.
[00:34:18.154 --> 00:34:19.795]  This is untold.
[00:34:19.795 --> 00:34:21.456]  This is off the charts.
[00:34:21.456 --> 00:34:23.656]  Jesse Benton, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:34:23.656 --> 00:34:25.917]  Thanks for having me Alex, I appreciate it.
[00:34:25.917 --> 00:34:31.779]  I also want to get your take on one of the biggest Las Vegas
[00:34:33.664 --> 00:34:48.124]  uh... groups that analyzes sports and they've been very accurate every election they're now saying that Ron Paul has a good chance of winning and it basically sounds like your analysis or my analysis about how he's the only republican that can win against Hillary
[00:34:48.784 --> 00:34:49.825]  But I'm going to shut up about that.
[00:34:49.825 --> 00:34:56.627]  Please get into the debate and your take on, or are you going to try to be a good sport and let them cheat?
[00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:57.668]  I'm not trying to be mean, Jesse.
[00:34:57.668 --> 00:34:59.608]  You guys are just too good at sports.
[00:34:59.608 --> 00:35:06.151]  When they're cheating out in the open, and you see the ref being paid off, you know, $1,000 by Don Carleone, you know there's a problem.
[00:35:07.316 --> 00:35:13.341]  Well, I've got to admit, I'm a little frustrated with the amount of coverage last night.
[00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:32.535]  This is unofficial because I haven't verified it yet, but I had one of my assistants back at the office, Michael Crakel, doing some analysis for me, and by his calculations, Ron got 8 questions and spoke for a total of 6 and a half minutes, whereas Rudy Giuliani got 14 questions and spoke for about 17 minutes.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.041]  Yeah, and you know, that's a little frustrating.
[00:35:37.041 --> 00:35:46.745]  And you know, more so, right after the fact, Romney, McCain, and Giuliani all got immediate interviews with either Wolf Blitzer or Larry King.
[00:35:46.745 --> 00:35:53.728]  And, you know, while Skinhead was pretty generous about offering Ron to come on their morning program today, which he couldn't do because of his flights,
[00:35:54.208 --> 00:35:56.270]  You know, it's the after-debate interviews.
[00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.372]  We were a little frustrated we were shut out.
[00:35:58.372 --> 00:35:59.572]  Well, we've looked at the numbers.
[00:35:59.572 --> 00:36:05.938]  What is there, about one-tenth of viewers on CNN morning, compared to a huge debate?
[00:36:05.938 --> 00:36:07.679]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:13.043]  Look, we don't want to cry too much about this, and you know, we are still... Yeah, but you have to!
[00:36:13.043 --> 00:36:13.644]  You have to!
[00:36:13.644 --> 00:36:15.866]  Listen, you're winning from behind.
[00:36:15.866 --> 00:36:17.367]  The American people are behind you.
[00:36:17.367 --> 00:36:19.749]  He's a populist constitutionalist.
[00:36:19.749 --> 00:36:21.710]  This is a major political realignment.
[00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:22.471]  They're panicking.
[00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:27.795]  So they literally, and I know lighting, I know cameras, they stuck him in the dark on the edge.
[00:36:27.795 --> 00:36:30.337]  They never cut to him.
[00:36:30.337 --> 00:36:35.681]  That was our calculation just watching it last night while I was busy dealing with a reporter being arrested.
[00:36:35.681 --> 00:36:37.542]  One of my reporters for no reason, literally.
[00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:44.405]  I was watching, and that's what the numbers we had, was Giuliani around 18, Ron Paul around 6 1⁄2.
[00:36:44.405 --> 00:36:48.869]  That means they got nearly triple the time of Ron Paul.
[00:36:48.869 --> 00:36:52.212]  Now, by any stretch of the imagination, that's not fair, Jesse.
[00:36:52.212 --> 00:36:55.395]  And look, in past debates, it was always fair exactly.
[00:36:55.395 --> 00:36:57.637]  Each person got an exact amount of time.
[00:36:57.637 --> 00:37:01.561]  This is rigged, and I think Ron Paul needs to speak out about it.
[00:37:02.572 --> 00:37:12.617]  Well, you know, the mainstream media has always been behind the curve on these kind of things, and they're behind the curve on picking up the through-grass-fire support for Ron Paul.
[00:37:12.617 --> 00:37:19.741]  You know, at the same time, I think that Ron did with his six minutes so much more than the other guys were able to do with triple their time.
[00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:20.421]  And you know what?
[00:37:20.421 --> 00:37:25.564]  I'm not so sure that giving these guys all this extra time is necessarily a great thing for them.
[00:37:25.564 --> 00:37:30.407]  You know, the American people want to hear Rudy Giuliani go on and on about
[00:37:31.227 --> 00:37:31.868]  Well, Jesse, that's key.
[00:37:31.868 --> 00:37:32.849]  He's not speaking to us, though.
[00:37:32.849 --> 00:37:35.070]  And a lot of top analysts have said this, even after we made the point.
[00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.091]  And I'll only say that today.
[00:37:36.091 --> 00:37:38.373]  We're not the only ones seeing this.
[00:37:38.373 --> 00:37:44.078]  It's as if the Republicans are playing to the elite and to foreign lobbies and don't even care what the people want to hear.
[00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:03.753]  Giuliani knows it's incredibly unpopular, even with Republicans, this war now.
[00:38:03.753 --> 00:38:08.054]  He knows over 80% from 75 a few months ago are now against the war.
[00:38:08.054 --> 00:38:08.875]  He doesn't care!
[00:38:08.875 --> 00:38:12.856]  He said we need to forge our military into nation-building?
[00:38:12.856 --> 00:38:14.817]  That means imperial troops?
[00:38:14.817 --> 00:38:17.258]  I mean, this guy's like Emperor Palpatine!
[00:38:17.258 --> 00:38:18.538]  Oh, yeah, you heard him last night.
[00:38:18.538 --> 00:38:24.220]  He said that we need to train our United States Army to be a nation-building force.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:28.222]  That came out of his mouth last night, so it's pretty clear what he would do if he was president.
[00:38:28.642 --> 00:38:37.448]  And, you know, I gotta say, I am a Republican, I'm a die-hard Republican, and I think that a Rudy Giuliani candidacy would be a death nail for the Republican Party.
[00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:43.252]  We would see a Democratic big government majority become permanent if we run Rudy Giuliani.
[00:38:43.252 --> 00:38:57.802]  You see the shrinking of the Republican base because of our dissatisfaction with the war and with police state nation-building, and, you know, quite frankly, our base shrinking because of the lack of conservative values.
[00:38:58.742 --> 00:38:59.203]  I don't know.
[00:39:13.579 --> 00:39:20.667]  By the way, that's what the top Las Vegas oddsmakers, who by the way are almost never wrong, they're the most accurate we've seen.
[00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:24.712]  You ought to read this NFL bookmaker analysis.
[00:39:24.712 --> 00:39:27.515]  It says only Ron Paul can beat the Democrats.
[00:39:27.515 --> 00:39:31.179]  They've done the spreads, they've done the analysis, and of course they're betting on him.
[00:39:31.179 --> 00:39:33.162]  There is literal betting going on.
[00:39:33.662 --> 00:39:34.163]  Right now.
[00:39:34.163 --> 00:39:36.564]  So the media is telling you Ron Paul doesn't exist.
[00:39:36.564 --> 00:39:38.406]  They're saying they're cheating in the polls.
[00:39:38.406 --> 00:39:41.348]  They're saying these numbers don't fit with their analysis.
[00:39:41.348 --> 00:39:51.576]  Las Vegas is saying that Ron Paul is the strong underdog and that Ron Paul is the only person that can win the presidency from the Republican ticket.
[00:39:51.576 --> 00:39:53.378]  Exactly what I've been telling you people.
[00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:58.541]  I think we should listen to what they say and take what they say very seriously.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.983]  Oh, absolutely, because they're not just putting out political announcements.
[00:40:19.983 --> 00:40:22.145]  Their whole world is on being right.
[00:40:22.145 --> 00:40:28.631]  Their whole world is on getting it 19 times out of 20, literally, or they're out of business.
[00:40:28.631 --> 00:40:34.296]  And this is one of the top analysts out there, especially on NFL, and they've done all the number spreads on this.
[00:40:34.296 --> 00:40:37.138]  Now, what's the strategy now?
[00:40:37.138 --> 00:40:38.179]  When is the next debate?
[00:40:38.179 --> 00:40:39.120]  How can we help Ron Paul?
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.902]  The next debate that we are officially in will be August the 5th.
[00:40:43.902 --> 00:40:50.866]  There's going to be a special edition of ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, so it's going to be Sunday morning, August the 5th.
[00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:55.229]  The way to keep helping Ron Paul is to keep sending all the money that you can afford to.
[00:40:55.229 --> 00:41:03.213]  These things are expensive and we're doing well financially, but we need to start buying some media buys and producing some commercials.
[00:41:03.213 --> 00:41:07.135]  Also, we're going to continue to do as much as we can with the internet through our YouTube channel.
[00:41:07.575 --> 00:41:09.376]  I think it's the most important thing.
[00:41:09.376 --> 00:41:20.503]  And just continue your online support with the blogs, with emailing reporters, with writing in to your local newspapers about Ron and about why you support him.
[00:41:20.503 --> 00:41:27.047]  Jesse Benton, Press Secretary, the head of media operations for the presidential campaign for Ron Paul.
[00:41:27.047 --> 00:41:30.829]  Have you seen the Washington Post article admitting that Ron Paul is very strong?
[00:41:32.233 --> 00:41:33.294]  Which article was that?
[00:41:33.294 --> 00:41:36.336]  I just saw one they wrote on our New Hampshire coordinator yesterday.
[00:41:36.336 --> 00:41:37.136]  It's a brand new one.
[00:41:37.136 --> 00:41:40.658]  I know there's so much coming out you can't keep track of it all because you're dealing with the media.
[00:41:40.658 --> 00:41:45.641]  But I mean they are admitting that he is now what they're calling a very powerful dark horse.
[00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:48.720]  Well, I think that's absolutely correct.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:55.602]  I would say that we still have to wear the Dark Horse mantra, because of our lack of access to tens of millions of dollars.
[00:41:55.602 --> 00:42:03.944]  But I think we are a powerful Dark Horse, and I think we're knocking right on the door, and I think we've got some of the quote-unquote top-tier candidates pretty nervous.
[00:42:06.451 --> 00:42:09.433]  What type of coverage did the congressman get last night?
[00:42:09.433 --> 00:42:15.477]  Because I need the specifics, as you were there, you were watching it all happen.
[00:42:15.477 --> 00:42:27.284]  We went into the spin room, which is apparently where your gentleman had some trouble right outside of, but went into the spin room and it's hard to tell, you know, because I try to collect cards from everyone that talks to Ron.
[00:42:27.284 --> 00:42:32.528]  There was a lot of alternative media, some general mainstream media, cameras, blogs,
[00:42:33.613 --> 00:42:36.794]  And he was probably getting the most attention of anybody in there.
[00:42:36.794 --> 00:42:40.936]  We were just kind of swamped by, engulfed in a circle of reporters.
[00:42:40.936 --> 00:42:42.257]  That was very good.
[00:42:42.257 --> 00:42:51.001]  This morning he went on Judge Napolitano's radio show, and then tonight he's going to be the lead on the Tucker Carlson show on MSNBC.
[00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:54.282]  He's got talking to some other major print reporters.
[00:42:54.282 --> 00:42:59.384]  There's going to be a major New York Times article, New York Times Magazine, coming out in about 10 days.
[00:42:59.384 --> 00:43:00.585]  But he was not given
[00:43:04.607 --> 00:43:07.148]  Post coverage by the big networks.
[00:43:07.148 --> 00:43:09.288]  That is outrageous.
[00:43:09.288 --> 00:43:11.209]  No, it wasn't for lack of trying.
[00:43:11.209 --> 00:43:15.151]  I tried to pin them down and we couldn't get that.
[00:43:15.151 --> 00:43:17.071]  Now they know he's the hot ticket.
[00:43:17.071 --> 00:43:20.813]  They know that's what the people want and they know they keep giving him FaceTime.
[00:43:20.813 --> 00:43:21.513]  It's over.
[00:43:21.513 --> 00:43:23.154]  He's going to win the nomination.
[00:43:23.154 --> 00:43:31.737]  Jesse, I'm going to let you go in just a minute and I appreciate all your time and I want to get you and the campaign chairman and the congressman back up in the next two to three weeks.
[00:43:32.077 --> 00:43:37.941]  Or anytime you want to pop in with an announcement or if you need support or need to rally the troops in any way with our audience.
[00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:38.982]  And again, we're honored to have you.
[00:43:38.982 --> 00:43:42.605]  We're all praying for you and the Congressman and the whole team.
[00:43:42.605 --> 00:43:48.149]  Just to give you details, an Infowars.com reporter was in and he's on the line right now.
[00:43:48.149 --> 00:43:49.990]  I'm going to bring him up after you're gone.
[00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.591]  He was there.
[00:43:51.357 --> 00:43:57.679]  He just confronted Giuliani about some of his actions on 9-11, where Giuliani said he got word the towers were going to fall.
[00:43:57.679 --> 00:43:58.639]  He told Peter Jennings that.
[00:43:58.639 --> 00:43:59.860]  We have the video.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.040]  We talked to Giuliani a week ago about this.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.761]  He denied he ever said it.
[00:44:03.761 --> 00:44:05.201]  Now we have the interview.
[00:44:05.201 --> 00:44:10.423]  They went back and talked to his campaign people and said, hey, you said this, and they just freaked out and said, get away from me.
[00:44:10.423 --> 00:44:14.664]  And the police ran up and arrested our reporter and then threatened to charge him.
[00:44:14.664 --> 00:44:15.464]  I'm not joking.
[00:44:15.464 --> 00:44:16.845]  They said with espionage.
[00:44:18.065 --> 00:44:21.987]  Does this sound like America to you when he had official CNN press passes?
[00:44:21.987 --> 00:44:38.113]  I have not seen anything other than your report at this point right now, so for me to comment too strongly would be inappropriate, but I am very much looking forward to seeing these videos up on YouTube and getting a little bit of information, because on first sniff, this just stinks.
[00:44:38.573 --> 00:44:40.434]  And I can't wait to see a little bit more.
[00:44:40.434 --> 00:44:47.856]  And if it's anything like the reports are right now, then the American people need to take a real strong look at this.
[00:44:47.856 --> 00:44:48.276]  All right.
[00:44:48.276 --> 00:44:50.316]  Jesse Benton, thank you for all the time.
[00:44:50.316 --> 00:44:51.917]  We'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[00:44:51.917 --> 00:44:53.137]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:44:53.137 --> 00:44:54.337]  There goes Jesse Benton.
[00:44:54.337 --> 00:44:58.739]  He is the media coordinator, the head of the media operations for President Ron Paul 2008.
[00:44:58.739 --> 00:45:02.060]  Congresswoman's run for the presidency.
[00:45:05.189 --> 00:45:11.795]  Going back to Matt Lepacek and of course Luke Radowski, and I'm going to keep you guys into the next hour.
[00:45:11.795 --> 00:45:13.336]  I appreciate you all holding.
[00:45:13.336 --> 00:45:20.862]  Had really no sleep driving back the four hours from New Hampshire to New York, Manhattan, where they live.
[00:45:20.862 --> 00:45:23.784]  They're at Luke's apartment right now.
[00:45:23.784 --> 00:45:32.031]  Matt, please continue with what happened once they put you in handcuffs, the stepping on the camera, the rest of it, where that went from there.
[00:45:32.031 --> 00:45:32.752]  All right.
[00:45:33.334 --> 00:45:38.203]  So, um, they pretty much, they put me, you know, they bend you over the police car, right?
[00:45:38.203 --> 00:45:41.729]  Made me sit there bent over the police car for three minutes and so I look like an idiot.
[00:45:42.668 --> 00:45:48.130]  All right, and they put me into the back of the police car waiting around for 10-15 minutes because no one knew what was going on.
[00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:49.671]  I didn't know what I was being charged with.
[00:45:49.671 --> 00:45:51.131]  I was never told what I was charged with.
[00:45:51.131 --> 00:45:52.652]  Yeah, they had to find somebody.
[00:45:52.652 --> 00:45:58.774]  They had to find somebody preemptively, I mean retroactively, after the fact to claim that you were trespassing.
[00:45:58.774 --> 00:45:59.334]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:45:59.334 --> 00:46:06.597]  Okay, so basically I'm in the car and they put me in the front seat to begin with, all right, and I've got my
[00:46:07.362 --> 00:46:13.443]  Uh, but basically I start, you know, moving around or whatever, trying to adjust my handcuffs, you know, just moving.
[00:46:13.443 --> 00:46:15.384]  I'm not in this particular situation before.
[00:46:15.384 --> 00:46:16.484]  I've never been arrested.
[00:46:16.484 --> 00:46:17.304]  I'm not a renegade.
[00:46:17.304 --> 00:46:19.224]  I'm not a radical.
[00:46:19.224 --> 00:46:19.944]  You know?
[00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:29.106]  So, I tried to adjust it, and this guy, one of these cops officers looked at me, opened up the door, took me out, tightened the cuffs even tighter, just like you see on cops, you know?
[00:46:29.106 --> 00:46:32.767]  And put me back in there, and said, if you do that again, you're going to be charged with this, this, this, and that, or whatever.
[00:46:33.877 --> 00:46:36.138]  So whatever, we'll wait around a couple more minutes.
[00:46:36.138 --> 00:46:40.179]  By the way, I've been arrested quite a few times at protests and things.
[00:46:40.179 --> 00:46:44.540]  And yeah, when they put them on really tight, of course you want to wiggle and move, or it's hurting.
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.661]  Oh no, see, now moving is a crime.
[00:46:47.661 --> 00:46:49.962]  We've got to fill all these labyrinth prisons.
[00:46:49.962 --> 00:46:51.122]  Go ahead.
[00:46:51.122 --> 00:46:55.383]  So another car pulls up, they transfer me to it.
[00:46:55.383 --> 00:46:56.964]  I go into the other cop car, I'm on the way.
[00:46:57.862 --> 00:47:02.905]  And, uh, long story short, I had an opportunity to speak with a lot of these cops there.
[00:47:02.905 --> 00:47:04.745]  Um, three of them were absolutely a-holes.
[00:47:04.745 --> 00:47:09.568]  The one that I was speaking with, not to say that he was, you know, he had a phone call to say, shoot the guy, he wouldn't, you know.
[00:47:09.568 --> 00:47:13.189]  But, uh, the guy I was speaking to, dude, he really, he was receptive.
[00:47:13.189 --> 00:47:14.930]  We gave him all the Alex Jones information.
[00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.191]  I don't know, mysteries, terror storm, the whole deal.
[00:47:17.191 --> 00:47:19.012]  Anyhow, this guy was sort of receptive.
[00:47:19.012 --> 00:47:26.756]  And when I got back to the booking office and everything, we were talking about this whole thing for the entire time, talking about everything, you know, from this, that, A to Z. This one guy,
[00:47:27.318 --> 00:47:30.720]  You know, in comparison to all the other a-holes over there, you know?
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.000]  Really stood out among the crowd.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.063]  Again, not to say that if you got a phone call saying, throw this guy in a cage, he wouldn't do anything, you know?
[00:47:37.063 --> 00:47:39.904]  But, um, it was interesting, that perspective.
[00:47:39.904 --> 00:47:48.289]  This is the guy that you heard, um, you know, when they went to turn off the notebook after we actually got back to the police station.
[00:47:48.289 --> 00:47:49.849]  We pulled up to this.
[00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:54.652]  It was freaking me out, actually, because, obviously, I'm aware that Giuliani is mafioso, alright?
[00:47:55.402 --> 00:48:04.331]  So, you know, there's also always a paranoia part of this, as you're going through these things, you're trying to react the best you possibly can, remain calm.
[00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:07.775]  You're not sure whether you're pretending to remain calm, or are you sure you actually are.
[00:48:07.775 --> 00:48:17.024]  But for the most part, we get in there, we pull up, we reach this gate, the gate starts to rise up, we pull in, it's a small little cubby, we go out,
[00:48:17.691 --> 00:48:21.193]  Do they freak out when you explain this has been transmitted over the web live?
[00:48:34.139 --> 00:48:37.800]  I was saying that the whole time, because Alex, I researched this a long time ago and I found out about it.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.621]  As long as you tell them it's fine, yeah.
[00:48:39.621 --> 00:48:40.941]  I told them a thousand times.
[00:48:40.941 --> 00:48:42.081]  You're on LiveInner Television.
[00:48:42.081 --> 00:48:44.442]  We're trying to make a spectacle out of this stuff, understand?
[00:48:44.442 --> 00:48:46.403]  We're trying to make truth TV and take back the media here.
[00:48:46.403 --> 00:48:47.063]  Yeah, what do you think?
[00:48:47.063 --> 00:48:49.743]  We're broadcasting a TV show here, you twit!
[00:48:49.743 --> 00:48:53.104]  Yeah, I mean, uh, this is, uh, CNN, uh, anti-propaganda.
[00:48:53.104 --> 00:48:55.825]  You know, they have a sign over there that says CNN equals politics.
[00:48:55.825 --> 00:48:56.205]  Duh!
[00:48:56.205 --> 00:48:57.406]  CNN equals politics.
[00:48:57.406 --> 00:48:58.186]  Yeah, we know that already.
[00:48:58.186 --> 00:48:59.246]  Thank you very much.
[00:48:59.246 --> 00:49:00.286]  CNN equals propaganda.
[00:49:00.286 --> 00:49:02.047]  So what happened once they learned that it had been recorded?
[00:49:02.791 --> 00:49:08.241]  So, once they were on the record, he says, you know, that's where he gives me the explanation, and perhaps you've heard it on the live stream.
[00:49:08.241 --> 00:49:10.145]  He said, actually, in New Hampshire, we have this law.
[00:49:10.145 --> 00:49:14.894]  And I said, you know, actually, I researched a little bit before, and it's actually a two-party, yadda yadda, as long as one of us...
[00:49:15.601 --> 00:49:33.581]  as uh... consent then it doesn't matter they're at a public event there's no expectation of privacy i don't like that they say i don't want to the rest of me they put handcuffs on me i never had an opportunity to turn off the equipment okay i've got handcuffs on me it's up and they're off their criminals they're criminal enemies of america please continue their enemies go ahead
[00:49:35.382 --> 00:49:36.162]  Look, they're scum.
[00:49:36.162 --> 00:49:37.443]  Let's start admitting what they are.
[00:49:37.443 --> 00:49:37.723]  Go ahead.
[00:49:37.723 --> 00:49:40.503]  They are, okay, but we have to convert them.
[00:49:40.503 --> 00:49:41.043]  They're our friends.
[00:49:41.043 --> 00:49:42.043]  We need their style tactics.
[00:49:42.043 --> 00:49:43.604]  Let me tell you something.
[00:49:43.604 --> 00:49:47.044]  Most of these guys would blow toddlers' heads off if they were ordered to.
[00:49:47.044 --> 00:49:48.204]  Okay, I've studied them.
[00:49:48.204 --> 00:49:49.985]  They'd run incinerators.
[00:49:49.985 --> 00:49:50.885]  Let me stop you.
[00:49:50.885 --> 00:49:52.905]  They'd run incinerators if they were told to.
[00:49:52.905 --> 00:49:56.426]  They'd line up old women all day and blow their heads off, okay?
[00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:57.766]  That's what America is now.
[00:49:57.766 --> 00:49:59.106]  They watch Jack Bauer.
[00:49:59.106 --> 00:50:01.247]  They fantasize about torturing people.
[00:50:01.247 --> 00:50:02.127]  This is who they are.
[00:50:02.862 --> 00:50:04.205]  I've seen them frame people.
[00:50:04.205 --> 00:50:07.490]  I've seen them torture women into signing documents to take their children.
[00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:09.193]  I've seen it over and over again.
[00:50:09.193 --> 00:50:13.120]  Not all cops, but these cops are absolute enemies of America.
[00:50:21.653 --> 00:50:27.477]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:50:27.477 --> 00:50:35.122]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:50:35.805 --> 00:50:43.248]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:50:43.248 --> 00:50:54.992]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:50:54.992 --> 00:50:58.974]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:50:58.974 --> 00:51:01.214]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:01.214 --> 00:51:05.076]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:31.649 --> 00:51:35.130]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:39.893]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.

[00:51:50.819 --> 00:51:56.542]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:51:56.542 --> 00:52:03.166]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp

[00:52:20.394 --> 00:52:24.417]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:52:24.417 --> 00:52:27.139]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[00:52:33.523 --> 00:52:38.626]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:52:38.626 --> 00:52:47.572]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:53:48.248 --> 00:53:52.492]  We still don't know who the mystery person is because they were driving all night to get back to New York.
[00:53:52.492 --> 00:54:04.444]  Somebody shot video, uploaded it to the web with no bugs, no InfoWars.com, no we are changed, no 9-11 students for truth.
[00:54:04.444 --> 00:54:05.165]  Just it's up there.
[00:54:05.165 --> 00:54:05.846]  That's fine.
[00:54:05.846 --> 00:54:06.987]  It's on the Drudge Report.
[00:54:06.987 --> 00:54:07.928]  It's all over the place.
[00:54:09.506 --> 00:54:11.027]  It's the top story on Digg.
[00:54:11.027 --> 00:54:12.428]  It's huge.
[00:54:12.428 --> 00:54:14.989]  Because it illustrates the tyranny right there on camera.
[00:54:14.989 --> 00:54:16.690]  Now I know we've got Jason Bermas holding.
[00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:17.431]  I've forgotten that.
[00:54:17.431 --> 00:54:18.711]  I apologize, Jason.
[00:54:18.711 --> 00:54:19.872]  Of the Loose Change crew.
[00:54:19.872 --> 00:54:23.414]  I'm executive producing with the new Final Cut.
[00:54:23.414 --> 00:54:28.236]  My good friend and comrade-in-arms in the fight against the New World Order for the Republic.
[00:54:28.236 --> 00:54:31.438]  As Ron Paul said last week, this is the final battle for the Republic.
[00:54:31.438 --> 00:54:33.879]  The country is fighting for its life right now.
[00:54:33.879 --> 00:54:34.900]  It's happening right now!
[00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:37.693]  That's why they're showing their teeth.
[00:54:37.693 --> 00:54:39.555]  That's why they're really making a move.
[00:54:39.555 --> 00:54:41.056]  That's why we're not pulling any punches.
[00:54:41.056 --> 00:54:43.097]  We're showing ours too, folks.
[00:54:43.097 --> 00:54:45.499]  We're just starting to fight, okay?
[00:54:45.499 --> 00:54:52.923]  We haven't even begun to unleash the full power of the American people with the spirit of God's light shining through us.
[00:54:52.923 --> 00:54:55.145]  Thank Jesus for all that.
[00:54:55.145 --> 00:54:59.948]  And God does get all the glory and all the good things in this world come from God and our Creator.
[00:54:59.948 --> 00:55:02.610]  Now, I also want to go to Luke Rodowski, who's been holding.
[00:55:03.234 --> 00:55:06.635]  And let's continue and finish your story on what happened in jail, what happened right now.
[00:55:06.635 --> 00:55:07.915]  Let's bring up Luke Rudowsky.
[00:55:07.915 --> 00:55:09.615]  Let's bring up Jason Burmash.
[00:55:09.615 --> 00:55:12.756]  Folks, I'm so busy I'm not going to even plug my films really right now.
[00:55:12.756 --> 00:55:14.997]  Just go to InfoWars.com if you want to support us.
[00:55:14.997 --> 00:55:16.897]  Get the books, get the videos, get the materials.
[00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:22.638]  That's how I fund a lot of this and we're just literally extinguishing all our funds right now in the fight.
[00:55:22.638 --> 00:55:24.919]  We're putting it all in right now to fund all this.
[00:55:25.679 --> 00:55:27.281]  I mean, this is one of the worst things ever.
[00:55:27.281 --> 00:55:31.224]  I mean, in America, you ask a politician a question and you're going to be arrested?
[00:55:42.611 --> 00:55:47.013]  I mean, and you're going to be charged with criminal trespassing even though you have credentialed trespassers?
[00:55:47.013 --> 00:55:48.153]  I mean, this is criminal!
[00:55:48.153 --> 00:55:52.895]  I mean, I don't know, I don't know how these scum, treasonous scum could get away with this.
[00:55:52.895 --> 00:55:55.336]  I mean, it was, it was crazy wild.
[00:55:55.336 --> 00:55:58.557]  Matt Rapacious asked a question to Giuliani's people.
[00:55:59.051 --> 00:56:00.292]  I was there with the camera.
[00:56:00.292 --> 00:56:01.953]  I was recording everything, right?
[00:56:01.953 --> 00:56:03.114]  The Giuliani people got mad.
[00:56:03.114 --> 00:56:06.216]  They pointed to him, and I don't know why they also pointed to me.
[00:56:06.216 --> 00:56:09.018]  I didn't even ask a question, but they pointed to me also.
[00:56:09.018 --> 00:56:14.402]  And then the cops came, the big cops came, and then the guy who was talking to the Giuliani people... Yeah, that's important.
[00:56:14.402 --> 00:56:18.245]  You're the eyewitness, and every other witness I've talked to, like five, said the same thing.
[00:56:18.245 --> 00:56:20.346]  They pointed you guys out.
[00:56:20.346 --> 00:56:21.227]  They gave the order.
[00:56:21.707 --> 00:56:25.009]  Yeah, and what's really funny, they pointed me out, and I was even silent.
[00:56:25.009 --> 00:56:26.610]  I was the camera person.
[00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:27.551]  I was quiet.
[00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:28.911]  That's the weird thing about it.
[00:56:28.911 --> 00:56:30.452]  None of the candidates came out.
[00:56:30.452 --> 00:56:33.974]  It was like they knew we were there, just to prevent us from questioning them.
[00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:35.335]  And you know what's really weird?
[00:56:35.335 --> 00:56:41.019]  Matt LePage was the gentleman asking the question, and the pollster, the guy, the Giuliani's campaign manager, engaged Matt.
[00:56:41.679 --> 00:56:42.059]  Major news!
[00:56:42.059 --> 00:56:42.800]  I didn't know that.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.680]  Give me details.
[00:57:07.262 --> 00:57:10.705]  Give me the details of the attempted theft by the Giuliani campaign.
[00:57:10.705 --> 00:57:12.686]  They were grabbing my camera about three times.
[00:57:12.686 --> 00:57:13.447]  They hit the camera.
[00:57:13.447 --> 00:57:16.770]  They tried to steal the camera, so I couldn't stop recording Matt getting arrested.
[00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:18.051]  Well, that's because they're mad!
[00:57:18.051 --> 00:57:22.754]  It was on Fox and MSNBC, the footage you guys shot of confronting Giuliani last week.
[00:57:22.754 --> 00:57:23.355]  They're mad!
[00:57:24.051 --> 00:57:27.712]  Look, they physically abused, they physically assaulted Matt Lipasek.
[00:57:27.712 --> 00:57:30.273]  And that's not even, it gets worse than that.
[00:57:30.273 --> 00:57:31.914]  I mean, for God's sake.
[00:57:31.914 --> 00:57:34.694]  I mean, I was even a part, I was even with Matt that time.
[00:57:34.694 --> 00:57:40.957]  Stay there, I want to come back to you and what you witnessed inside and how, specifically, who these weasels are on the video.
[00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:43.857]  I need you to start identifying them on the video that's online.
[00:57:43.857 --> 00:57:45.218]  These are criminal charges.

[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.902]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:23.095 --> 00:59:24.396]  Big Brother.
[00:59:24.396 --> 00:59:26.176]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:26.176 --> 00:59:27.917]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:27.917 --> 00:59:29.498]  You want answers?
[00:59:29.498 --> 00:59:31.058]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:31.058 --> 00:59:35.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:41.923]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:41.923 --> 00:59:50.827]  On Infowars.com, reporter Matt Lepacek was kidnapped by paramilitary forces of the federal government, idiot state police, who I guarantee you
[00:59:51.847 --> 00:59:59.674]  Don't even know they're part of federal police set up under the British Commonwealth reorganization of the United States under the War Powers Act of 1933.
[00:59:59.674 --> 01:00:04.258]  If you didn't know that, you fools, don't you sit there and laugh at me.
[01:00:04.258 --> 01:00:08.982]  You go read it for yourself and find out who you really work for.
[01:00:08.982 --> 01:00:10.343]  This is unbelievable.
[01:00:11.443 --> 01:00:15.224]  And we've got Luke Rodowski of InfoWars.com and WeAreChange.org.
[01:00:15.224 --> 01:00:16.284]  He was there.
[01:00:16.284 --> 01:00:18.304]  They broke our camera.
[01:00:18.304 --> 01:00:20.945]  They assaulted his camera, which is my camera as well.
[01:00:20.945 --> 01:00:22.445]  Tried to get it away from him.
[01:00:22.445 --> 01:00:27.646]  The Loose Change crew was there reporting for American Freedom from Fascism as well as InfoWars.com.
[01:00:27.646 --> 01:00:31.647]  And they witnessed a lot of this.
[01:00:31.647 --> 01:00:35.468]  You've got the local, well they have to be based there in New Hampshire, but the national
[01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:37.942]  Students for 9-11 Truth.
[01:00:37.942 --> 01:00:40.344]  Need to get their site and plug that, too.
[01:00:40.344 --> 01:00:41.505]  They're all there.
[01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:42.506]  This is unbelievable.
[01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:49.251]  And the big story here is on Dig, that I'm reading right now, and other places, it's saying, hey, I'm glad they arrested him.
[01:00:49.251 --> 01:00:49.491]  Good.
[01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:50.672]  Put him in camps.
[01:00:50.672 --> 01:00:52.593]  Hey, you're not allowed to ask questions.
[01:00:52.593 --> 01:00:54.435]  The officer says, leave, you gotta leave.
[01:00:54.435 --> 01:01:04.162]  I guess if a cop comes to my door and goes, knock, knock, mow my yard, or routinely here in Austin, hey, they pull over the topless dancers when they leave drunk, I'll take you into jail unless you go have sex with me right now.
[01:01:04.162 --> 01:01:05.363]  I guess that's a lawful order.
[01:01:06.472 --> 01:01:07.974]  You know, I guess you've got to start locking Mexico.
[01:01:07.974 --> 01:01:08.855]  You've got to pay them off.
[01:01:08.855 --> 01:01:10.136]  It's a lawful order.
[01:01:10.136 --> 01:01:10.496]  No!
[01:01:10.496 --> 01:01:13.119]  This is not how America is supposed to run.
[01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:16.302]  By the way, Judge, we've got huge immigration news coming up, folks.
[01:01:16.302 --> 01:01:17.443]  Wait until you hear this.
[01:01:17.443 --> 01:01:19.185]  But I'm going to continue with our guest right now.
[01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:22.191]  This one lady in particular started grabbing at the camera and started hitting it.
[01:01:22.191 --> 01:01:23.551]  She hit it three times.
[01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:48.613]  I don't know how they recognized me because I was the camera person.
[01:01:48.613 --> 01:01:50.835]  I was separate away from Matt.
[01:01:50.835 --> 01:01:53.157]  It was like me and Matt were two separate people.
[01:01:53.157 --> 01:01:54.758]  And we were just asking questions.
[01:01:54.758 --> 01:01:56.720]  And they somehow pointed me out.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.662]  And they made a connection between me and Matt.
[01:01:58.662 --> 01:01:59.622]  I don't know how.
[01:01:59.622 --> 01:02:01.404]  It's like they had foreign knowledge of who we were.
[01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:04.750]  And after that, after they tried to grab these cameras, I told this lady, no!
[01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:06.910]  What you're doing is illegal, you just assaulted me!
[01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:09.971]  She started hitting and grabbing at the camera, I told her no!
[01:02:09.971 --> 01:02:13.192]  So what she did, she went back, and then she got the police.
[01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:24.455]  Then she got the police, she got about five, seven officers to go... By the way, we got video of illegal aliens busting Americans' heads open, and then they go get the cops, and the citizen is arrested for having their heads split.
[01:02:24.455 --> 01:02:26.455]  That's the new America, go ahead.
[01:02:26.455 --> 01:02:29.996]  And the semi-police officers are running, are coming to me, and I...
[01:02:30.397 --> 01:02:33.552]  And, um, I walk up right to these police officers, like, do you guys have a problem?
[01:02:33.552 --> 01:02:34.114]  What happened here?
[01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:35.051]  Right?
[01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:41.857]  And the police officer, one grabs me by my left arm, other one grabs me by my right arm, they pick me up and they start dragging me out the room for no reason!
[01:02:41.857 --> 01:02:43.918]  And I'm not even with Matt at this point!
[01:02:43.918 --> 01:02:44.899]  I'm not even with him!
[01:02:44.899 --> 01:02:46.540]  And they start dragging me out!
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.981]  I assaulted him!
[01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:48.722]  He killed him!
[01:02:48.722 --> 01:02:49.883]  He's evil!
[01:02:49.883 --> 01:02:51.604]  And they're like, who's paying you to be here?
[01:02:51.604 --> 01:02:52.625]  Who's paying you to be here?
[01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:53.506]  What are you doing here?
[01:02:53.506 --> 01:02:55.467]  And they start questioning, interrogating me!
[01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:57.168]  They physically assaulted me!
[01:02:57.168 --> 01:03:01.172]  Did you tell the enemies of America that you were with the American people?
[01:03:01.172 --> 01:03:01.712]  I told them!
[01:03:01.712 --> 01:03:04.274]  I'm an American citizen reporting for InfoWars.com!
[01:03:04.574 --> 01:03:10.195]  I only have a question for this scum Giuliani that he is, because he lies to the family members and rescue workers.
[01:03:10.195 --> 01:03:12.316]  I represent those family members and rescue workers.
[01:03:12.316 --> 01:03:17.037]  I told the people that they're loud there, and they were dragging me out of there, and I didn't even do nothing.
[01:03:17.037 --> 01:03:23.099]  They just made the association, whatever, they must have known who the hell I was, and they just started dragging me out of there.
[01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:27.280]  Stay there, I want to hear more about this, but I want to bring up next, Jason Burmiss.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.020]  Jason, we're about to break, but stay there when we get back.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.821]  I want to get your take on this, but in the 45 seconds we've got, what was this like?
[01:03:33.807 --> 01:03:34.607]  It was incredible.
[01:03:34.607 --> 01:03:40.669]  This was all put together by AFTF Media and Samuel Otero, basically the director.
[01:03:40.669 --> 01:03:46.971]  He shot some stuff for the final cut out in Shanksville and last week contacted me and said, you know, we can get these press passes.
[01:03:46.971 --> 01:03:54.873]  So me and Samuel were correspondents for LTAFTF, InfoWars, and then we got in there with our two cameramen and it was wild.
[01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:58.614]  The first people we went to were Giuliani's people and it got live real quick, Alex.
[01:03:59.719 --> 01:04:02.582]  And then you were able to stay after everybody else got grabbed.
[01:04:02.582 --> 01:04:03.923]  We'll also hear about that.
[01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:07.827]  Actually, Alex, I'll give you the whole thing and how the whole thing started with Giuliani's people right after.
[01:04:07.827 --> 01:04:08.287]  Stay there.
[01:04:08.287 --> 01:04:08.627]  Stay there.
[01:04:08.627 --> 01:04:09.128]  We got a break.
[01:04:09.128 --> 01:04:13.672]  We'll come right back to Jason Bermas, then back to Matt, and then, of course, Luke Radowski.
[01:04:13.672 --> 01:04:14.813]  And there's other folks there as well.
[01:04:14.813 --> 01:04:16.034]  We're going to get them all on.
[01:04:16.034 --> 01:04:16.515]  Stay with me.
[01:04:21.883 --> 01:04:22.544]  It's here.
[01:04:22.544 --> 01:04:27.709]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:27.709 --> 01:04:35.316]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:36.047 --> 01:04:43.489]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:43.489 --> 01:04:55.212]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:55.212 --> 01:04:59.193]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:59.193 --> 01:05:01.454]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:01.454 --> 01:05:05.295]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:18.769 --> 01:05:21.970]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:26.151]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:26.151 --> 01:05:28.771]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:28.771 --> 01:05:31.292]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:31.292 --> 01:05:39.793]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:39.793 --> 01:05:41.234]  The brookie light is different.
[01:05:41.234 --> 01:05:47.235]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:05:47.415 --> 01:05:59.289]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals and nitrates.
[01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:05.657]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:06:05.657 --> 01:06:16.064]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium, 888-803-4438, or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:06:16.064 --> 01:06:18.326]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:18.326 --> 01:06:22.849]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:25.711]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[01:06:25.711 --> 01:06:28.332]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:35.077]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[01:06:35.357 --> 01:06:36.538]  What does this mean in the garden?
[01:06:36.538 --> 01:06:47.944]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength, blue-ribbon garden produce jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-bricks wheatgrass.
[01:06:47.944 --> 01:06:51.126]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[01:06:51.126 --> 01:06:53.928]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[01:06:53.928 --> 01:07:00.932]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[01:07:01.212 --> 01:07:06.013]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and might just be the ultimate hard times barter item.
[01:07:06.013 --> 01:07:09.994]  To grow tastier fruits and vegetables right now, go to growlikecrazy.com.
[01:07:09.994 --> 01:07:12.075]  That's growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:07:12.075 --> 01:07:12.135]  877-327-0365.
[01:07:12.135 --> 01:07:13.195]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:14.415]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:33.319 --> 01:07:33.399]  Yeah.
[01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:44.837]  All right, let's go back to Jason Bermas, Luke Rodowski.
[01:07:44.837 --> 01:07:47.277]  Let's bring up Luke and Jason both at the same time.
[01:07:47.277 --> 01:07:48.558]  You guys just go back and forth.
[01:07:48.558 --> 01:07:50.198]  You've got the floor.
[01:07:50.198 --> 01:07:58.460]  Incredible attack on the First Amendment inside of the whole debate complex in the big press area, the main overflow area.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:01.180]  What you witnessed, what happened, how this all broke down.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.241]  And Luke, you come back in.
[01:08:02.241 --> 01:08:05.661]  The lady assaults you, then she calls the police on you.
[01:08:05.661 --> 01:08:08.402]  And then put Matt back on the phone after you're done.
[01:08:08.402 --> 01:08:08.702]  Go ahead.
[01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:13.637]  Well, I'd just like to say that this didn't even really start with Luke, myself, or Matt.
[01:08:13.637 --> 01:08:24.002]  There was an independent journalist, about 4'5", maybe 55 years old, who stepped into the middle and started talking about Ron Paul to these three press people.
[01:08:24.002 --> 01:08:26.904]  They seemed to get a little agitated, and I asked a follow-up question.
[01:08:26.904 --> 01:08:28.745]  Well, you know, it made mainstream media.
[01:08:28.745 --> 01:08:33.827]  Ron Paul asked if he had read the 9-11 Commission report, blowback, imperial hubris, and others.
[01:08:33.827 --> 01:08:36.709]  Basically, his argument for why they hate us.
[01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:38.202]  And they couldn't answer me.
[01:08:38.202 --> 01:08:39.403]  They couldn't answer me.
[01:08:39.403 --> 01:08:40.843]  They tried to turn it around and I ran.
[01:08:40.843 --> 01:08:44.624]  It was at that moment that Matt asked about the collapse yet again.
[01:08:44.624 --> 01:08:49.906]  And by that time you really saw the press coming up and then you saw the police coming up.
[01:08:49.906 --> 01:09:00.208]  Now, Matt starts asking his question about that and as they're dragging him away, Samuel Otero asks his people about his connections to Centrist Corp.
[01:09:00.208 --> 01:09:02.469]  And they start dragging Samuel away.
[01:09:02.469 --> 01:09:05.790]  So, we actually have the tape of Matt getting arrested and cuffed outside.
[01:09:06.195 --> 01:09:07.935]  We literally didn't get back till 7 a.m.
[01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:08.836]  today.
[01:09:08.836 --> 01:09:11.056]  Slept for four hours, and I'm sitting next to him right now.
[01:09:11.056 --> 01:09:13.737]  We're trying to upload everything to digital file.
[01:09:13.737 --> 01:09:20.498]  I'll put it on a server, get it up for you guys for YouTube, and we're gonna try to get some mp3s going for The Loud and the Word's radio show on GCN Live.
[01:09:20.498 --> 01:09:26.960]  It's on Stream 4, so hopefully we'll have some stuff for that, but basically when they took Samuel out, he's like, look, we're on the list.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.080]  We're Press Credentials.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.860]  You don't know about Centrist Corp.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:30.780]  I mean, you're the media.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.321]  You're supposed to know, so please let him back in.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.361]  All of a sudden, the media surrounded Samuel.
[01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:37.283]  He told them all about Centrist Corp.
[01:09:37.283 --> 01:09:39.725]  Meanwhile, you know, Matt is being arrested.
[01:09:39.725 --> 01:09:45.811]  Yeah, for those that don't know, that's the big Spanish-slash-Australian company that Perry's handed over 8,000 miles of roads.
[01:09:45.811 --> 01:09:48.993]  They're handing over all the major... I mean, the biggest deal in world history.
[01:09:48.993 --> 01:09:51.696]  All the major power plants that supply at least six states.
[01:09:51.696 --> 01:09:53.717]  We even sell it to California.
[01:09:53.717 --> 01:09:55.419]  They're handing over all the major lakes.
[01:09:55.419 --> 01:09:56.520]  Total raping.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.642]  Private companies hiring giant SWAT teams.
[01:09:59.102 --> 01:10:03.624]  Secret intelligence operations, foreign troops, total wall-to-wall New World Order.
[01:10:03.624 --> 01:10:05.065]  We are under total takeover.
[01:10:05.065 --> 01:10:07.166]  Giuliani's running the whole thing.
[01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:08.786]  I mean, the country is dying!
[01:10:08.786 --> 01:10:11.087]  I'm in the middle of the attack right here in Texas.
[01:10:11.087 --> 01:10:13.208]  They're in the middle of the attack in New Hampshire.
[01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.749]  First Amendment being stomped on.
[01:10:14.749 --> 01:10:17.750]  Idiot state police stomping around.
[01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:19.351]  Just please, this is making me sick!
[01:10:19.952 --> 01:10:24.535]  Yeah, I mean, so to look at it, they didn't want to answer the independent journalist questions.
[01:10:24.535 --> 01:10:28.778]  Other journalists started asking who we were and what our credentials were.
[01:10:28.778 --> 01:10:30.940]  And when we had them, they were very upset with us, Alex.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.140]  All this is on tape.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.182]  They didn't know whether they had read the 9-11 Commission report.
[01:10:35.182 --> 01:10:41.907]  Apparently, they didn't know that he was involved in the centrist group, which literally is a pathway to the North American Union.
[01:10:41.907 --> 01:10:44.409]  People, you really need to look at this stuff.
[01:10:44.409 --> 01:10:45.609]  And that was a huge story.
[01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:49.072]  And that's really only part of it, Alex, because I've got four other presidential
[01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:53.725]  Uh, campaigners there, on record about the Pakistani ISI wire.
[01:10:53.725 --> 01:10:54.745]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:10:54.745 --> 01:10:55.625]  Here's the deal.
[01:10:55.625 --> 01:11:00.186]  I'm at picture lock in like three weeks, and I wanna, I've got a section on the roads.
[01:11:00.186 --> 01:11:02.866]  I need, I know we've got other video, but I want the video you guys shot.
[01:11:02.866 --> 01:11:04.327]  Those can be really good.
[01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:11.148]  Uh, of this being brought up about CentraCore, because I was leaving Giuliani out, because I didn't think it would make sense, you're showing some news articles about it.
[01:11:11.148 --> 01:11:14.248]  I'd love to show that, so get that to me as quickly as you can, Burmese.
[01:11:14.248 --> 01:11:17.129]  Absolutely, like I said, we got here at seven,
[01:11:17.965 --> 01:11:19.285]  Like three, four hours sleep.
[01:11:19.285 --> 01:11:21.286]  Everything is being dubbed and uploaded right now.
[01:11:21.286 --> 01:11:22.887]  I'm going to be doing the encoding.
[01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:25.087]  Hopefully I'll have MP3s up by tonight.
[01:11:25.087 --> 01:11:25.907]  Now that's fantastic.
[01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:27.668]  I'm talking about the next day or two.
[01:11:27.668 --> 01:11:29.569]  Make me a DVD tape and send it to me.
[01:11:29.569 --> 01:11:30.009]  You got it.
[01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:30.649]  You got it.
[01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:31.489]  Just give me some selects.
[01:11:31.489 --> 01:11:33.030]  I know you're busy, but you can do that.
[01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:34.010]  Now, listen.
[01:11:35.296 --> 01:11:36.597]  Let's continue here.
[01:11:36.597 --> 01:11:39.920]  Let's bring up Matt Lepacek and Luke Radowski.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.181]  Luke, are you on the line?
[01:11:41.181 --> 01:11:42.002]  Yeah, I'm here, Matt.
[01:11:42.002 --> 01:11:44.625]  Let's have you finish up, and then I want to bring Matt back on.
[01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:53.713]  Finish up with, we're at the point of the Giuliani lady assaults you, attacks the camera, hits it three times, and then runs off and sicks the police on you.
[01:11:53.713 --> 01:11:55.214]  They come up to you.
[01:11:55.214 --> 01:11:55.995]  What happens from there?
[01:11:56.235 --> 01:11:59.819]  They start dragging me out, asking me who I'm with, who's paying me to be here.
[01:11:59.819 --> 01:12:07.568]  They drag me outside, they push me in a wall, and they have police officers right in my face, grabbing my press credentials, trying to rip the press credentials off my neck.
[01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:10.512]  Saying, who you are, what you're being, give me your ID, give me your identification.
[01:12:10.512 --> 01:12:12.053]  I was like, what did I do, sir?
[01:12:12.053 --> 01:12:14.575]  All I did was ask a question, this is nothing illegal.
[01:12:14.575 --> 01:12:16.596]  And then the police are just intimidating me.
[01:12:16.596 --> 01:12:20.699]  They had six foot five cops here, looking me straight in the eyes, trying to intimidate me, trying to scare me.
[01:12:20.699 --> 01:12:25.142]  With drill sergeant hats on, you work for stinking foreign banks, you dumb cops.
[01:12:25.142 --> 01:12:28.505]  They shoot your kids up full of cancer viruses and mercury.
[01:12:28.505 --> 01:12:30.386]  You fools, where are your friends?
[01:12:30.386 --> 01:12:31.647]  You idiots!
[01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:33.188]  Exactly, and they don't understand that.
[01:12:33.368 --> 01:12:38.412]  They don't understand that we're confronting these scum, and these scum are against them, and we're trying to work with the police department.
[01:12:38.412 --> 01:12:42.436]  But then the CNN people come by, and they're like, wait, he didn't do nothing.
[01:12:42.436 --> 01:12:43.537]  Don't arrest him.
[01:12:43.537 --> 01:12:44.838]  And they didn't arrest me.
[01:12:44.838 --> 01:12:47.981]  And it was too late, because they... So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:12:47.981 --> 01:12:49.482]  Who stopped you from getting arrested?
[01:12:49.482 --> 01:12:50.403]  The CNN people.
[01:12:50.403 --> 01:12:51.724]  The CNN people.
[01:12:51.724 --> 01:12:53.966]  And they also tried to stop, I'm told, from witnesses.
[01:12:53.966 --> 01:12:55.087]  LePacek, but that didn't work.
[01:12:55.623 --> 01:12:56.183]  That didn't work.
[01:12:56.183 --> 01:12:57.944]  They already had LePacek in handcuffs.
[01:12:57.944 --> 01:12:59.806]  They were taking all my information down.
[01:12:59.806 --> 01:13:01.226]  They were about to handcuff me.
[01:13:01.226 --> 01:13:03.588]  So the CNN people came by and they were like, don't arrest him.
[01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:05.769]  You know, he didn't do nothing wrong.
[01:13:05.769 --> 01:13:06.569]  And they just let him go.
[01:13:06.569 --> 01:13:10.972]  It was Giuliani's thugs, Giuliani's campaign managers, who really, you know, organized everything.
[01:13:10.972 --> 01:13:12.453]  And they really are responsible for all this.
[01:13:12.453 --> 01:13:14.994]  And it's sick and disgusting what they're doing!
[01:13:14.994 --> 01:13:19.177]  I'll tell you what I hate is after they drag you guys out and arrest Matt LePacek,
[01:13:20.558 --> 01:13:27.301]  His head pollster, his head campaign strategist, it's the press secretary that runs off and does the tattling.
[01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:32.064]  He turns around with satisfied pleasure and goes, and that's what they deserve.
[01:13:32.064 --> 01:13:37.266]  They normally would assault me with a pie and claims you were assaulting.
[01:13:37.266 --> 01:13:38.167]  I mean, implies it.
[01:13:38.167 --> 01:13:39.427]  They're just such trash.
[01:13:39.427 --> 01:13:43.169]  He was actually engaging us with conversation afterwards.
[01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.130]  No, no, he runs back.
[01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:46.051]  They run off the tattle.
[01:13:46.758 --> 01:13:53.782]  And then he comes back, and then Matt's going, Sir, we could sit down, and we're going to play this later, we could sit down and talk about this.
[01:13:53.782 --> 01:13:56.043]  I could show you on the laptop Giuliani saying it.
[01:13:56.661 --> 01:13:57.401]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:57.401 --> 01:14:01.283]  And this guy's smiling, and then he had these little press secretary girls.
[01:14:01.283 --> 01:14:05.624]  There was also females, though, that were running around and doing all this, getting the police officers there.
[01:14:05.624 --> 01:14:07.105]  And it's criminal what they did.
[01:14:07.105 --> 01:14:11.746]  See, man, the whole... He's talking bad about the Don!
[01:14:11.746 --> 01:14:14.427]  You don't talk about the Don!
[01:14:14.427 --> 01:14:15.388]  You understand?
[01:14:15.388 --> 01:14:19.609]  This is a new America, with the son of a known capo mob boss.
[01:14:19.609 --> 01:14:21.330]  He's gonna be running things, capisce?
[01:14:22.268 --> 01:14:22.748]  Exactly.
[01:14:22.748 --> 01:14:24.789]  These guys are criminals and they're going down, man.
[01:14:24.789 --> 01:14:26.510]  And I don't know, I mean, it's disgusting.
[01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:29.011]  I was sick to my stomach and I'm pissed off right now, man.
[01:14:29.011 --> 01:14:29.832]  Let me tell you something.
[01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:31.413]  I got home, let me just tell you something.
[01:14:31.413 --> 01:14:34.734]  I got home at 2.30 because we posted that article at around 10.
[01:14:34.734 --> 01:14:37.636]  We called you right before it happened, got it posted.
[01:14:37.636 --> 01:14:42.578]  I stayed up here until about 2, all jacked up, working on Endgame and adding to the article there in Dykes.
[01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:46.540]  And I got in bed at 2.30 and couldn't go to sleep.
[01:14:47.181 --> 01:14:52.388]  Okay, and I couldn't go to sleep till like four, rolling around on the bed, literally sick.
[01:14:53.104 --> 01:14:56.066]  Because it was the image of those big, mean cops.
[01:14:56.066 --> 01:14:59.129]  They were literally daggers going into America's heart.
[01:14:59.129 --> 01:15:01.050]  And I realize they'll do whatever they're told.
[01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:02.291]  They'll do whatever they're told.
[01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:03.512]  And it's sick and disgusting.
[01:15:03.512 --> 01:15:05.173]  Matt Lepacek is not a criminal.
[01:15:05.173 --> 01:15:09.577]  These police officers, these Giuliani thugs, should be arrested for treason.
[01:15:09.577 --> 01:15:12.619]  It's the destruction of freedom of speech and the Constitution.
[01:15:12.619 --> 01:15:13.820]  And we have to stand up for it.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:15.221]  We have to make this case public.
[01:15:15.221 --> 01:15:17.322]  We have to bail out Matt Lepacek yesterday with $400.
[01:15:18.203 --> 01:15:19.904]  He has a court date, July 3rd.
[01:15:19.904 --> 01:15:23.826]  He has criminal charges against him for asking a damn question!
[01:15:23.826 --> 01:15:25.567]  I mean, people, wake up!
[01:15:25.567 --> 01:15:26.868]  They broke our camera.
[01:15:26.868 --> 01:15:28.089]  They stole the battery.
[01:15:28.089 --> 01:15:30.670]  The battery that came with the camera is stolen.
[01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:32.031]  They still have it.
[01:15:32.031 --> 01:15:33.532]  They didn't give it back to us.
[01:15:33.532 --> 01:15:35.653]  But I sent you extra batteries, right?
[01:15:35.653 --> 01:15:36.394]  Yeah, that's extra batteries.
[01:15:36.394 --> 01:15:38.115]  Well, listen, here's the deal.
[01:15:38.115 --> 01:15:42.778]  I'm gonna send you two new cameras, five new batteries, and I'm gonna send $400 for LaPace.
[01:15:43.923 --> 01:15:45.063]  God bless you, man.
[01:15:45.063 --> 01:15:47.204]  That would definitely help us out.
[01:15:47.204 --> 01:15:49.264]  That would definitely work, you know.
[01:15:49.264 --> 01:15:54.105]  Listen, and we're going to make sure those hundreds, we're going to make sure, in fact, I've got it all on the stack.
[01:15:54.105 --> 01:15:58.006]  I've got the Governor's number, I've got the numbers to the New Hampshire State Police.
[01:15:58.006 --> 01:16:09.709]  We are going to incinerate their lines in the next few days and get everybody to call them and to call for criminal charges against the State Police and call for criminal charges on Giuliani's people.
[01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:11.130]  Exactly!
[01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:12.952]  Matt Lipasek is not a criminal.
[01:16:12.952 --> 01:16:14.053]  I am not a criminal.
[01:16:14.053 --> 01:16:15.094]  All we did is ask questions.
[01:16:15.094 --> 01:16:18.277]  By the way, they'll twist that and say it's an Al Qaeda plot to burn up phone lines.
[01:16:18.277 --> 01:16:22.081]  I mean, figure of speech, so many phone calls coming through, it'll burn up the lines.
[01:16:22.081 --> 01:16:27.366]  They'll probably have a CNN headline, Terrorist Jones plan to blow up phone lines.
[01:16:27.366 --> 01:16:31.510]  I'm saying, we will make so many calls that the phone lines figuratively melt.
[01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:32.411]  Gotta watch them now.
[01:16:32.411 --> 01:16:33.212]  Gotta watch them.
[01:16:33.212 --> 01:16:34.513]  They'll claim that was espionage.
[01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:42.082]  We have to support each other, we have to stand strong, and we can't allow these treasonous activities to be allowed.
[01:16:42.082 --> 01:16:43.023]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:16:43.023 --> 01:16:49.068]  I'm getting all these calls and emails of other people that shot this, other reporters, saying they want to send me the footage, want to give me the footage.
[01:16:49.068 --> 01:16:50.269]  Don't do that.
[01:16:50.269 --> 01:16:59.317]  Upload it to Google, to YouTube, put some website you believe in, whether it's InfoWars.com or WeAreChange.org or whatever site you want to put up.
[01:17:00.452 --> 01:17:02.793]  Yeah, I mean I have video also of it.
[01:17:02.793 --> 01:17:04.954]  I have the camera as they are dragging me out.
[01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.334]  We're going to be releasing the footage.
[01:17:06.334 --> 01:17:07.475]  I'm going to be working on it right now.
[01:17:07.475 --> 01:17:08.815]  We're going to release the footage.
[01:17:24.621 --> 01:17:26.402]  Later on tonight, I'm going to be working very hard.
[01:17:26.402 --> 01:17:27.082]  We just got home.
[01:17:27.082 --> 01:17:27.822]  We're going to work very hard.
[01:17:27.822 --> 01:17:28.723]  We're going to release the footages.
[01:17:28.723 --> 01:17:30.724]  And by the way, you've got David Gergen.
[01:17:30.724 --> 01:17:33.525]  You've got other presidential candidates.
[01:17:33.525 --> 01:17:42.368]  You've got Hillary Clinton, that nobody's seen yet, being confronted a few days ago on 9-11, and the person being assaulted, Fodi being assaulted, a great patriot.
[01:17:42.368 --> 01:17:43.609]  You guys are on fire!
[01:17:43.609 --> 01:17:47.270]  And what I like is, first it's one of you, then it's two of you, then it's five of you.
[01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:49.111]  Now it's like six or eight patriots.
[01:17:49.111 --> 01:17:52.432]  Isn't that exciting, Jason Burnham, that the numbers are just swelling?
[01:17:52.452 --> 01:17:58.156]  And I gotta tell you, it's the path to success and it's the path to regaining our constitutional republic.
[01:17:58.156 --> 01:18:02.920]  Now that we actually have press credentials and are able to get them through CNN like we didn't.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:03.760]  We didn't lie to CNN.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.363]  We said, look, we're representatives of American freedom to fascism and loose change.
[01:18:07.363 --> 01:18:11.806]  And one of the reporters took me aside and he's like, you know, who are you?
[01:18:11.806 --> 01:18:12.867]  Who are you with?
[01:18:12.867 --> 01:18:15.429]  And I handed him loose change second edition and he looks at me.
[01:18:15.871 --> 01:18:19.675]  And he's like, oh, you made that 9-11 crackpot documentary.
[01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:21.236]  I can't believe you're in here.
[01:18:21.236 --> 01:18:22.618]  Did you tell him who you were?
[01:18:22.618 --> 01:18:24.780]  I'm like, first of all, did you even watch it?
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.822]  And he's like, oh, I saw some of it.
[01:18:26.822 --> 01:18:27.943]  I'm like, no, you didn't.
[01:18:27.943 --> 01:18:30.385]  You heard what Neocon said about it and you prejudged it.
[01:18:30.385 --> 01:18:31.506]  Here's a copy.
[01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:33.568]  And I'm like, why wouldn't I get a press pass?
[01:18:33.568 --> 01:18:36.271]  We have the most watched internet documentary of all time.
[01:18:36.271 --> 01:18:37.332]  We've been on the History Channel.
[01:18:37.825 --> 01:18:40.326]  I do a weekly radio show.
[01:18:40.326 --> 01:18:41.107]  I am a reporter.
[01:18:41.107 --> 01:18:43.388]  We are the media.
[01:18:43.388 --> 01:18:45.789]  We never demand respect because I don't care.
[01:18:45.789 --> 01:18:47.370]  But the world needs to know.
[01:18:47.370 --> 01:18:52.673]  PrisonPlanet.com is tens of thousands of times bigger than RushLimbaugh.com in every rating service.
[01:18:52.673 --> 01:18:53.573]  They're a joke.
[01:18:53.573 --> 01:18:55.354]  You're a dinosaur scum.
[01:18:55.354 --> 01:18:58.196]  Your days are numbered where you monopolize everything.
[01:18:58.982 --> 01:19:01.923]  I want to hear what else this scum said to you.
[01:19:01.923 --> 01:19:02.263]  They are!
[01:19:02.263 --> 01:19:02.943]  They're scum!
[01:19:02.943 --> 01:19:04.524]  We have to start hating these people!
[01:19:04.524 --> 01:19:05.864]  We have to start getting aggressive!
[01:19:05.864 --> 01:19:07.725]  We're not trying to take their tax money!
[01:19:07.725 --> 01:19:09.046]  We're not trying to feed on them!
[01:19:09.046 --> 01:19:11.346]  We're not trying to take their country away!
[01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:14.167]  We're fighting for a country that's going down!
[01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:19.209]  We need to start hating these people!
[01:19:19.209 --> 01:19:22.250]  Do you know that you can go with solar for under $1,200 bucks now?
[01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:23.571]  Hi, this is Ken Soler.
[01:19:23.571 --> 01:19:27.672]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:33.705]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:19:33.705 --> 01:19:40.130]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[01:19:40.868 --> 01:19:43.729]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:53.971]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:19:53.971 --> 01:19:57.731]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:19:57.731 --> 01:20:00.572]  You know, power companies, government.
[01:20:00.572 --> 01:20:04.413]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:20:04.413 --> 01:20:05.633]  Are you ready to go solar?
[01:20:05.633 --> 01:20:06.593]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[01:20:11.535 --> 01:20:25.100]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:30.122]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:30.122 --> 01:20:32.904]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:32.904 --> 01:20:33.984]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:40.874]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:40.874 --> 01:20:49.140]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:52.442]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:52.442 --> 01:20:58.786]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:20:58.786 --> 01:21:00.127]  Call for your copy today.
[01:21:00.127 --> 01:21:00.307]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:10.097]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:21:10.097 --> 01:21:10.257]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:10.257 --> 01:21:10.497]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:23.113]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:21:23.113 --> 01:21:30.576]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:21:30.576 --> 01:21:41.402]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:21:41.402 --> 01:21:45.944]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:21:46.244 --> 01:21:51.428]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:21:51.428 --> 01:21:54.610]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:54.610 --> 01:22:04.497]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:18.843]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[01:22:18.843 --> 01:22:22.084]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[01:22:22.084 --> 01:22:25.145]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[01:22:25.145 --> 01:22:25.885]  is a real thing.
[01:22:25.885 --> 01:22:32.727]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[01:22:33.547 --> 01:22:43.898]  Fuel is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[01:22:43.898 --> 01:22:52.548]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of disease activators that cause chronic health issues and means a much higher level of wellness for you and your family.

[01:23:08.661 --> 01:23:12.744]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:23:28.125 --> 01:23:33.607]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:23:33.607 --> 01:23:39.029]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:23:39.029 --> 01:23:41.750]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-coming.
[01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.751]  There wasn't as many as there was a-whaling.
[01:23:44.011 --> 01:23:44.732]  Welcome back.
[01:23:44.732 --> 01:23:47.415]  We've got another cameraman who is inside separately.
[01:23:47.415 --> 01:23:49.297]  He's going to be calling in the studio in about 10 minutes.
[01:23:49.297 --> 01:23:51.559]  I need to get into the huge immigration news.
[01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:52.760]  It is massive.
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.202]  The bill has now leaked out.
[01:23:54.202 --> 01:23:56.745]  Senators have released the 20 loopholes.
[01:23:56.745 --> 01:23:58.266]  It is complete amnesty.
[01:23:58.266 --> 01:24:00.008]  Worse than I first thought.
[01:24:00.008 --> 01:24:01.610]  That's almost impossible, but it is.
[01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:03.472]  It's worse than previous bills that have been public.
[01:24:05.231 --> 01:24:08.755]  Uh, from what the analysis we've gotten, it's a secret bill, is it was as bad.
[01:24:08.755 --> 01:24:10.297]  No, no, it's far worse.
[01:24:10.297 --> 01:24:15.643]  Uh, we have a bunch of Ron Paul clips and Giuliani clips calling for, you know, imperial government and everything else.
[01:24:15.643 --> 01:24:16.484]  That's all coming up.
[01:24:17.296 --> 01:24:19.717]  We'll also take some calls in the third hour.
[01:24:19.717 --> 01:24:20.757]  I want to get to it all.
[01:24:20.757 --> 01:24:22.258]  I mean, I have all of Ron Paul's comments.
[01:24:22.258 --> 01:24:23.638]  It's only six minutes long.
[01:24:23.638 --> 01:24:26.660]  We have Giuliani's comments that were 17 minutes.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:27.820]  Oh, that's a fair debate.
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:30.601]  You heard Ron Paul's campaign saying, yes, it's rigged.
[01:24:30.601 --> 01:24:31.922]  It's rigged!
[01:24:31.922 --> 01:24:34.783]  Six minutes versus over 15 minutes.
[01:24:34.783 --> 01:24:35.403]  He's rigged.
[01:24:35.903 --> 01:24:36.824]  Okay.
[01:24:36.824 --> 01:24:38.484]  Matt, let's bring Matt Lepacek up.
[01:24:38.484 --> 01:24:41.266]  This is an Infowars.com reporter who got grabbed.
[01:24:41.266 --> 01:24:42.886]  Matt, I want to say you've got the right stuff.
[01:24:42.886 --> 01:24:44.047]  You were very calm.
[01:24:44.047 --> 01:24:44.867]  You were very focused.
[01:24:44.867 --> 01:24:48.129]  We're going to air the three-minute audio of this coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:48.129 --> 01:24:55.672]  But what else happened to you, Matt Lepacek, when you were inside of the state police facility?
[01:24:55.672 --> 01:25:02.035]  Well, basically, within the state police facility, I'm sitting there waiting around, wondering what I'd be in charge with, because I'd asked that question several times in the car.
[01:25:02.648 --> 01:25:05.110]  If at all we think it's trespassing, we're not exactly sure.
[01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:07.733]  We're going to get back to the station and get this all figured out.
[01:25:07.733 --> 01:25:16.782]  So I'm sitting there waiting around, and he all of a sudden gets a phone call and says, OK, yes, it's criminal trespassing, right?
[01:25:16.782 --> 01:25:25.050]  And from that point forward, we received another phone call from a gentleman saying that someone was coming to pick me up, having no idea who this person was.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:34.684]  And then we then started contacting Mike Naar and the other guys, the team leaders over here that are with us trying to see who was going to come pick me up from the place.
[01:25:34.684 --> 01:25:36.905]  So I ended up being in there for about an hour and a half or so.
[01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:41.720]  And, uh, there wasn't too many other events that took place once I was actually in there.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:51.683]  Um, I can tell you that once we got outside of the parking lot, all of us were there, we were all filming them, and they tried the police officer, who I was saying was, you know, uh, respectable at least, okay?
[01:25:51.683 --> 01:25:57.245]  Um, and it was taking issue with the fact that we were recording them, and again, bringing up the fact that... You always gotta love that!
[01:25:57.245 --> 01:26:02.866]  I mean, I mean, they got cameras in school bathrooms, cameras all over the streets, and they're like, Don't film us!
[01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:04.527]  Oh, it's our privacy!
[01:26:04.527 --> 01:26:04.567]  Oh!
[01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:07.621]  Yeah, way, way, way.
[01:26:07.621 --> 01:26:12.222]  These people... Progressive grassroots is how we're going to take control of this machine.
[01:26:12.222 --> 01:26:14.423]  We have to understand it's an uphill battle.
[01:26:14.423 --> 01:26:15.723]  But we can do this.
[01:26:15.723 --> 01:26:17.504]  One man can do it.
[01:26:17.504 --> 01:26:18.464]  Anybody can do this.
[01:26:18.464 --> 01:26:26.926]  Hey, and Matt, it's a lot more exciting, isn't it, to be fighting the New World Order than bowling or trying to act cool for some girl.
[01:26:26.926 --> 01:26:33.707]  I mean, this is how you really... You are a man, but this is how you really become a man, is fighting the New World Order.
[01:26:33.707 --> 01:26:34.868]  This is what it's all about.
[01:26:34.868 --> 01:26:36.028]  It's what men are supposed to do.
[01:26:36.668 --> 01:26:43.553]  And you guys are just... I admire you guys, and I just am glad to be associated with you and everybody in this movement.
[01:26:43.553 --> 01:26:45.454]  I am just so blessed.
[01:26:45.454 --> 01:26:48.896]  So they were trying to tell you to quit videotaping, and that is just so classic.
[01:26:48.896 --> 01:26:51.938]  And on that I would say, Alex, I mean, obviously you know this already here.
[01:26:51.938 --> 01:26:53.799]  I mean, you're like a recharge for us over here.
[01:26:53.799 --> 01:27:01.304]  I mean, if we didn't have you to listen to, we'd have someone to bitch about, to moan, and basically represent us and fight for us.
[01:27:01.866 --> 01:27:04.927]  You know, we wouldn't have the necessary strength and energy that we have.
[01:27:04.927 --> 01:27:08.627]  So I think the Brotherhood and the Sisterhood of all of us together know what we're doing here.
[01:27:08.627 --> 01:27:12.468]  We stand up as one against these evil mothers, you know.
[01:27:12.468 --> 01:27:14.949]  If we actually do something, we can take this back.
[01:27:14.949 --> 01:27:17.809]  The small ideas, creativity, truth TV.
[01:27:17.809 --> 01:27:19.930]  Take back the media once at that time.
[01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:22.250]  We've got this whole live air coverage to you guys.
[01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:23.750]  We're not doing this to become powerful.
[01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:25.731]  We're doing this because we want you guys to do it.
[01:27:25.731 --> 01:27:27.471]  We've got a six-page white paper we're publishing.
[01:27:27.471 --> 01:27:30.952]  You guys are going to be able to do the same thing on your own cell phones and be able to publish this stuff.
[01:27:31.332 --> 01:27:36.354]  We are encouraging everyone to get out there, ask the same questions, start meet-up groups.
[01:27:36.354 --> 01:27:50.818]  That's always been the problem is that they can grab your cameras, like when I had special forces order, just in San Antonio, order the MPs to come up with guns to our chest and steal our tape that was in World Net Daily because the troops admitted they did arrest us or detain us.
[01:27:51.478 --> 01:27:54.181]  But, you know, we don't have the video because they took it.
[01:27:54.181 --> 01:27:55.803]  And so many times they take it.
[01:27:55.803 --> 01:28:00.848]  But if you've got this live feed, I mean, literally, I thought, I wonder what the guys are doing.
[01:28:00.848 --> 01:28:02.490]  So I just put the children to bed.
[01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:03.411]  I was about to go back to work.
[01:28:04.719 --> 01:28:05.800]  I just kissed my wife goodnight.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.583]  I walked downstairs about 8.30 Central, 9.30 Eastern, about 8.20 actually.
[01:28:10.583 --> 01:28:15.145]  I click on WeAreChanged.org and there's the stream and I'm like, oh, it hasn't crashed.
[01:28:15.145 --> 01:28:21.029]  And just to see the exchange right before you got grabbed, right when the cops came up, and then it cut out.
[01:28:21.821 --> 01:28:25.544]  And then I left, and I looked at message boards, and they said, yeah, I heard him in the squad car.
[01:28:25.544 --> 01:28:26.265]  I heard it all.
[01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:27.926]  This is the future.
[01:28:27.926 --> 01:28:35.772]  And it's just, we've got to get some better connectivity system and get some more... You know, right now, this is just a question of, we're trying to streamline this so we don't have to pay for the bandwidth.
[01:28:35.772 --> 01:28:41.416]  We're using free services, and we've gone from one after another, Stick'em, to Camtrain, and... It won't work.
[01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.837]  None of the free stuff works.
[01:28:42.837 --> 01:28:44.058]  Let me tell you something.
[01:28:44.058 --> 01:28:48.742]  It would have cost to feed everybody... Listen, if we put that on our front page, and we tried to stream it out,
[01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:59.600]  Let's say to 15,000 people, which probably would have tried to watch it last night, just randomly, that's a guesstimation, it would have been about... Eh, probably about three grand.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.641]  But you know what?
[01:29:00.641 --> 01:29:01.822]  I'll dump the money into it.
[01:29:01.822 --> 01:29:02.963]  I just don't care anymore.
[01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:09.229]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:10.610]  We're on the march.
[01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:13.152]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:13.152 --> 01:29:15.855]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:35.964 --> 01:29:36.244]  I think so.
[01:29:53.368 --> 01:30:00.109]  And believe strongly that the American people need alternative sources of information in order to understand the society they live in today.
[01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:03.350]  You won't find a better selection of books or videos anywhere.

[01:30:27.516 --> 01:30:28.376]  Concise?
[01:30:28.376 --> 01:30:29.357]  Hard-hitting?
[01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:32.639]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[01:30:32.639 --> 01:30:34.361]  War in Iran?
[01:30:34.361 --> 01:30:36.002]  A coming One World Church?
[01:30:36.762 --> 01:30:42.586]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[01:31:19.332 --> 01:31:27.478]  Attention women over 40, if you want to look as much as 20 years younger in less than one minute, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:31:27.478 --> 01:31:28.199]  Here's why.
[01:31:28.199 --> 01:31:32.642]  There's a brand new cosmetic product that makes wrinkles almost invisible to the naked eye.
[01:31:32.642 --> 01:31:38.067]  In fact, the new product allows some women to look so young so fast that it makes them feel like they're cheating.
[01:31:38.067 --> 01:31:40.128]  They are in a way, but it works.
[01:31:40.128 --> 01:31:43.731]  By the way, it's also a jealously guarded secret used by professional models.
[01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:49.095]  You see, these women often have to look much younger than they really are, or else they lose their jobs.
[01:31:49.095 --> 01:31:56.461]  The product uses something like a magician's trick to actually de-age the appearance of human skin, and it's now available to listeners of this station.
[01:31:56.461 --> 01:32:00.805]  Want to take years off your appearance and don't want cosmetic surgery or painful injections?
[01:32:01.005 --> 01:32:06.832]  There is now a very real chance you can do it with this new cream called Simply Magician's Formula 987.
[01:32:06.832 --> 01:32:07.653]  Just go to 987magic.com.
[01:32:07.653 --> 01:32:08.494]  That's 987magic.com.
[01:32:08.494 --> 01:32:09.035]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:32:09.035 --> 01:32:09.315]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:29.411 --> 01:32:36.779]  The front page of CNN, columnist, author, released after being arrested in a spin room.
[01:32:36.779 --> 01:32:39.582]  A reporter, an accredited reporter was arrested.
[01:32:39.582 --> 01:32:41.263]  They said it was an accident.
[01:32:41.263 --> 01:32:45.588]  That makes the front page of CNN Manchester, New Hampshire.
[01:32:45.588 --> 01:32:46.429]  But the brutal
[01:32:47.276 --> 01:32:53.498]  Assault on our cameras, breaking a camera, attacking another, dragging someone out, falsely charging him.
[01:32:53.498 --> 01:32:56.159]  That's not going to be on CNN.
[01:32:56.159 --> 01:33:00.961]  We have gotten a call, a contact through Countdown with Keith Uberman.
[01:33:00.961 --> 01:33:02.202]  We're trying to work on that.
[01:33:02.202 --> 01:33:04.482]  Everybody call CNN, call Fox, call them all.
[01:33:04.482 --> 01:33:07.063]  Tell them they need to cover this attack on the First Amendment.
[01:33:07.063 --> 01:33:08.424]  They can't miss the video.
[01:33:08.424 --> 01:33:09.704]  It's on the Drudge Report.
[01:33:09.704 --> 01:33:11.285]  I know they all watch the Drudge Report.
[01:33:12.071 --> 01:33:13.692]  And I know they all know where the video came from.
[01:33:13.692 --> 01:33:23.956]  There's also a plug for InfoWars in there, audibly, from Matt Lepacek, who, again, ladies and gentlemen, if we were handing out medals, he deserves a Congressional Medal of Honor in the InfoWars for what he's done.
[01:33:23.956 --> 01:33:26.417]  So does Luke Radowsky, so does Jason Bermas.
[01:33:26.417 --> 01:33:27.718]  Finishing up with everybody right now.
[01:33:27.718 --> 01:33:29.739]  We'll have Part 2 of this tomorrow, if they can do it.
[01:33:29.739 --> 01:33:32.760]  I know a bunch of uploads are going up on WeAreChange, InfoWars.com.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:37.601]  Prison Planet, LooseChange911.com, all of it.
[01:33:37.601 --> 01:33:40.842]  Jason Bermas, you did get an interview with Sit Down with Ron Paul last night.
[01:33:40.842 --> 01:33:42.123]  That's going up soon.
[01:33:42.123 --> 01:33:48.824]  You did get one with Brownback about the Pakistani-ISI connection, which, by the way, you know is huge.
[01:33:48.824 --> 01:34:01.148]  Did you know Luke got, and I'm sure, I know he's coming up there soon, I hope we can get that in the new film, Luke got video, the team got video, bringing up the Pakistani
[01:34:02.436 --> 01:34:05.798]  ISI connection at the last debate.
[01:34:05.798 --> 01:34:07.439]  But let's bring Luke and you up together.
[01:34:07.439 --> 01:34:09.360]  We'll go back to Matt LePace in a minute.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.042]  There's so many here I can't keep track of anymore.
[01:34:12.042 --> 01:34:15.204]  Who was it specifically you guys got to talk about ISI?
[01:34:15.204 --> 01:34:16.184]  It was Biden.
[01:34:16.184 --> 01:34:18.826]  Senator Biden admitted that he met with the ISI chief.
[01:34:18.826 --> 01:34:21.268]  We got an article out on that at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:21.268 --> 01:34:23.249]  It's an orgy of news, folks.
[01:34:23.249 --> 01:34:25.010]  I could talk a week about each one of these articles.
[01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:27.511]  I don't even know how we're supposed to cover it all.
[01:34:27.511 --> 01:34:29.092]  I'm literally phoning at the mouth here.
[01:34:29.092 --> 01:34:30.093]  There's so many targets.
[01:34:30.093 --> 01:34:35.095]  I mean, it's like the Marines when they were surrounded in the fight against North Korea back in the 50s.
[01:34:35.095 --> 01:34:39.738]  And they said, you know, they radioed in to the general, sir, we're surrounded.
[01:34:39.738 --> 01:34:41.099]  The general was in the middle of them.
[01:34:41.099 --> 01:34:43.640]  And he said, good, don't let any of them escape.
[01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:45.442]  I mean, this is just awesome.
[01:34:45.442 --> 01:34:50.424]  I mean, this is what you want when you're in the info war, swinging your battle axes to have them all around you.
[01:34:50.424 --> 01:34:51.925]  Just more people you can't miss.
[01:34:51.925 --> 01:34:53.765]  Just start hacking.
[01:34:53.765 --> 01:35:06.171]  But, Jason, that's pretty exciting that they did get the ISI discussion with Senator Biden, but come in with your info with Brownback you were able to talk to.
[01:35:06.611 --> 01:35:11.014]  Yeah, I talked to Brownback among others, but Brownback's answer was the most interesting of all.
[01:35:11.014 --> 01:35:19.000]  None of the candidates I talked to actually denied the ISI transfer, and that was Duncan Hunter, Jim Gilmore, and Sam Brownback.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.222]  I think I got somebody else, but Brownback said something pretty funny to me.
[01:35:22.222 --> 01:35:26.685]  I said, well, you know, why don't the American people know about this Pakistani funding?
[01:35:26.685 --> 01:35:30.548]  He's like, well, probably the same reason that they don't know about the Saudi Arabian funding.
[01:35:30.548 --> 01:35:31.669]  And then I followed it up with,
[01:35:32.168 --> 01:35:38.050]  Well, could these two foreign governments be involved in the 27 redacted pages of the Congressional Report?
[01:35:38.050 --> 01:35:42.471]  And he just, he looked for a second, he kind of shook his head, and he said, I can't really comment on that.
[01:35:42.471 --> 01:35:50.073]  So, I mean, everybody I talked to in the mainstream couldn't deny the actual ISI connection at all.
[01:35:50.073 --> 01:35:52.774]  It was just, yeah, it was pretty wild, man.
[01:35:52.774 --> 01:35:53.614]  And you know, these guys,
[01:35:54.124 --> 01:35:59.149]  These guys can't deny it anymore, and I think this is a good angle to start, you know, this independent investigation.
[01:35:59.149 --> 01:36:07.858]  I keep telling listeners, when your congressmen or women come to your local church to give a speech, and they come to the local Rotary Club, when they go to anything, you need to be there.
[01:36:07.858 --> 01:36:15.025]  Whether you're an old Korean War vet, or a school teacher, or a black man, a white woman, it doesn't matter.
[01:36:15.766 --> 01:36:20.268]  Hispanic, Black, Texas, New York, California, I don't care.
[01:36:20.268 --> 01:36:21.689]  All of you have a responsibility.
[01:36:21.689 --> 01:36:28.692]  If we start confronting them, and I made this point earlier but I want to make it again, that's why they're setting up this national police state in this worldwide grid.
[01:36:28.692 --> 01:36:38.197]  They're banning confronting or even talking to the Royals or members of Parliament or having video cameras in sites all over England while they put up tens of millions of cameras.
[01:36:38.197 --> 01:36:39.958]  Now over five million in London alone.
[01:36:39.958 --> 01:36:42.319]  They're trying to ban speech here with free speech zones.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.326]  That's why they want cracker chips, as Nick Rockefeller told Aaron Russo, that's coming up in endgame.
[01:36:48.326 --> 01:36:49.768]  They're doing all of this.
[01:36:49.768 --> 01:36:51.390]  By the way, I've got to get that Tommy Thompson from you.
[01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:52.672]  That will go in endgame.
[01:36:52.672 --> 01:36:53.913]  I'm so glad you got that, Bermas.
[01:36:53.913 --> 01:36:55.896]  Jason Bermas, I commend you.
[01:36:55.896 --> 01:36:58.258]  All of this happening, all of this going on.
[01:37:00.742 --> 01:37:02.243]  I mean, because they're afraid.
[01:37:02.243 --> 01:37:05.544]  They've got to get their grit in, because they want to do all these bad things to us.
[01:37:05.544 --> 01:37:07.064]  They want to take over the economy.
[01:37:07.064 --> 01:37:08.284]  They want to bankrupt the dollar.
[01:37:08.284 --> 01:37:09.885]  They want to take your pension funds.
[01:37:09.885 --> 01:37:10.865]  They've said they're going to do it.
[01:37:10.865 --> 01:37:16.607]  They've changed the rules, so they claim they can, but they can't until they can oppress you when you fight back.
[01:37:16.607 --> 01:37:17.727]  Jason, comments?
[01:37:17.727 --> 01:37:18.507]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:18.507 --> 01:37:25.890]  I got some of these, you know, candidates to actually admit that, yes, the current immigration legislation is worse than blanket amnesty.
[01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:26.930]  Everything you're saying about it,
[01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.771]  It's true.
[01:37:27.771 --> 01:37:29.472]  It's not a pathway to citizenship.
[01:37:29.472 --> 01:37:33.916]  It's a worker's visa for citizenship, and then you can bring in 11 of your family members.
[01:37:33.916 --> 01:37:34.917]  That is the truth.
[01:37:34.917 --> 01:37:36.639]  This would kill this country.
[01:37:36.639 --> 01:37:39.101]  I talked about the American Union with a lot of these people.
[01:37:39.101 --> 01:37:43.044]  None of them are publicly for it, but we all know what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:37:43.044 --> 01:37:49.330]  And I just want to let people know that all this video is going to be uploaded, hopefully, to FreedomToFascism.com within the next couple of days.
[01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:52.052]  You can get the latest update, again, on my show tonight, 8 to 10 Eastern.
[01:37:53.166 --> 01:37:56.191]  And all the articles, of course, you're going to be able to go to Prison Planet and Infowars.
[01:37:56.191 --> 01:37:57.894]  You know, Aaron Dykes does a great job for you guys.
[01:37:59.591 --> 01:38:04.415]  So does Paul Watson and Steve Watson and the whole crew, and just everything is now coming to a head.
[01:38:04.415 --> 01:38:06.757]  There's lots of other videos being uploaded as well.
[01:38:06.757 --> 01:38:13.703]  We'll be posting them all up on theprisonplanet.com, infowars.com, and jonesreport.com, and of course right there at wearechange.org.
[01:38:13.703 --> 01:38:18.327]  A lot of great places, more and more venues to get the truth and the information, and that's so exciting.
[01:38:18.327 --> 01:38:23.952]  Jason, thank you, and I want to get you back up tomorrow to debrief you more on all the big events that happened and the other interviews you got.
[01:38:24.492 --> 01:38:29.855]  And just as fast as you can, give me that Tommy Thompson and that Ron Paul in the mail, my brother, and I thank you.
[01:38:29.855 --> 01:38:36.878]  You got it, Alex, and I'd just like to thank Aaron Russo and Samuel Otero again, AFTF Media and FreedomOfFascism.com.
[01:38:36.878 --> 01:38:38.379]  Thanks again, Alex, and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
[01:38:38.379 --> 01:38:40.600]  You bet, and I'm going to call you during the next break, okay?
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:41.040]  You got it.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:41.921]  Alright, here we go.
[01:38:41.921 --> 01:38:43.501]  Let's go back now.
[01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:44.282]  You just popped in my ear.
[01:38:44.282 --> 01:38:44.742]  What did you say?
[01:38:44.742 --> 01:38:50.525]  Okay, Chris Caesar was there, correct, and he got some footage.
[01:38:51.507 --> 01:38:58.612]  Let's go to Chris Caesar and then we're going to go back to Matt and others to finish up our discussion with them.
[01:38:58.612 --> 01:39:01.494]  Matt Lepacek and of course Luke Radowski.
[01:39:01.494 --> 01:39:02.634]  Let's go to Chris Caesar.
[01:39:02.634 --> 01:39:04.235]  Chris, you were there?
[01:39:04.235 --> 01:39:05.656]  Yes, I was, Alex.
[01:39:05.656 --> 01:39:08.438]  Listen, I really appreciate you contacting us.
[01:39:08.438 --> 01:39:10.159]  You said you shot some video of this.
[01:39:10.159 --> 01:39:11.720]  What did you see happen?
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:14.162]  Well, I actually just shot some audio of it.
[01:39:14.162 --> 01:39:14.982]  I took some pictures.
[01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:15.963]  I didn't have a camera on me.
[01:39:16.877 --> 01:39:23.341]  From what I saw, my vantage point was actually exactly the same as the camera that's on the Jones Report.
[01:39:23.341 --> 01:39:32.067]  So, I pretty much saw it all in person, and I could see someone gesturing to the police, and the police just came over and took him right out.
[01:39:32.067 --> 01:39:37.090]  And I asked him why he got arrested and just followed him out.
[01:39:37.090 --> 01:39:38.771]  Did you get photos of him being cuffed?
[01:39:39.587 --> 01:39:40.988]  I have photos of that, yes.
[01:39:40.988 --> 01:39:41.648]  Oh, awesome.
[01:39:41.648 --> 01:39:43.609]  Because we don't have that yet.
[01:39:43.609 --> 01:39:47.611]  How soon do you think you can email those to AaronAtInfoWars.com?
[01:39:47.611 --> 01:39:48.872]  Almost immediately.
[01:39:48.872 --> 01:39:49.652]  I mean, don't you love it?
[01:39:49.652 --> 01:39:55.075]  I'm here during the breaks, writing articles on the telephone, telling folks, you know, my take on articles.
[01:39:55.075 --> 01:39:56.956]  I'm gathering data on air.
[01:39:56.956 --> 01:39:58.617]  Listeners, you're getting the whole bird's eye view.
[01:39:58.617 --> 01:40:00.178]  This is how it all operates.
[01:40:00.178 --> 01:40:02.779]  Paul Watson always jokes, why should the government listen to our phones?
[01:40:02.779 --> 01:40:04.059]  They hear it all on the air.
[01:40:04.059 --> 01:40:04.780]  This is our life.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.201]  This is what we do.
[01:40:06.201 --> 01:40:08.463]  We kind of multitask and do it all in one spot.
[01:40:08.463 --> 01:40:11.646]  And it's citizen reporters like yourself, Chris Caesar.
[01:40:11.646 --> 01:40:12.586]  Are you with the media?
[01:40:12.586 --> 01:40:14.788]  I mean, tell us about yourself.
[01:40:14.788 --> 01:40:20.033]  Well, I actually just won a contest that the network was holding for bloggers.
[01:40:20.033 --> 01:40:22.995]  So I am a reporter for a really small paper nearby.
[01:40:22.995 --> 01:40:23.756]  Oh, tell us!
[01:40:23.756 --> 01:40:25.477]  Tell us all about it.
[01:40:25.477 --> 01:40:26.798]  It's called the Tritown Times.
[01:40:26.798 --> 01:40:28.900]  I mean, it's certainly nothing of note.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:32.243]  But yeah, this is certainly more important.
[01:40:33.613 --> 01:40:38.299]  I mean, what did you just, you know, just in a sentence or two sum it up?
[01:40:38.299 --> 01:40:40.601]  What was it like seeing this happen?
[01:40:40.601 --> 01:40:42.203]  It was terrifying.
[01:40:42.203 --> 01:40:47.629]  And I mean, after I'd also witnessed Eric Alterman get arrested, which was a shocking thing.
[01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:51.334]  Okay, now we've got the CNN whitewash on that.
[01:40:51.334 --> 01:40:53.196]  What really happened with Eric Alterman?
[01:40:53.843 --> 01:41:10.389]  Well, I didn't see the inciting incident, but it seemed like he was being totally calm, and from what he said, he was standing in a public venue as it was, and gave an answer to the police officer that he didn't necessarily like, and he cuffed him.
[01:41:10.389 --> 01:41:16.692]  And, uh, I mean, so with that in mind, and with seeing your reporters getting arrested, I was trying to be as cautious as possible.
[01:41:17.475 --> 01:41:28.318]  But when the police weren't even giving their badge numbers, I started to get a little heated myself, and eventually we got them to give the badge numbers, but yeah, so it was just a completely terrifying thing to see.
[01:41:28.318 --> 01:41:34.600]  It is scary because CNN even admits this guy, CNN report right here, they admit he did nothing.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:41.902]  He was just sitting there, he had press passes, cops walk up, and they said, we're cuffing you, and this is just some separate guy with a local newspaper,
[01:41:42.829 --> 01:41:48.954]  They're in New Hampshire, and we've got another local New Hampshire News reporter, Chris Caesar, on the line with us.
[01:41:48.954 --> 01:41:50.596]  Let's bring up Matt Lepacek.
[01:41:50.596 --> 01:41:53.398]  Matt, what is it like now seeing things through the eyes of Chris Caesar?
[01:41:55.074 --> 01:42:00.679]  Well, I mean, for the most part, I don't know if I really have a comment, but I've got to look at the footage myself.
[01:42:00.679 --> 01:42:02.100]  I can barely remember what I said.
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:02.841]  I was in the spirit.
[01:42:02.841 --> 01:42:03.642]  I was in the moment there.
[01:42:03.642 --> 01:42:05.483]  But I mean, now you're hearing it from his angle.
[01:42:05.483 --> 01:42:06.704]  See, I've talked to so many people.
[01:42:06.704 --> 01:42:08.766]  We're getting a really clear picture of this.
[01:42:08.766 --> 01:42:12.549]  This is Giuliani's people just going, seize that name!
[01:42:12.549 --> 01:42:13.790]  In the name of the crown!
[01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:15.672]  And then you're just off to the who-scale.
[01:42:15.672 --> 01:42:17.193]  Yeah, I'm glad we had the opportunity to do this.
[01:42:17.193 --> 01:42:18.835]  You know, there's this guy over here, Mike Nara.
[01:42:18.835 --> 01:42:20.056]  We've got so many guys working with us.
[01:42:20.461 --> 01:42:21.824]  We wouldn't have had a dime to do this.
[01:42:21.824 --> 01:42:24.188]  We wouldn't have a 35-foot RV.
[01:42:24.188 --> 01:42:27.335]  You know, we wouldn't have had the funding to do this kind of stuff.
[01:42:27.335 --> 01:42:29.699]  We could change the world overnight.
[01:42:29.699 --> 01:42:31.222]  I'm telling you people.
[01:42:31.222 --> 01:42:32.565]  Overnight revolution.
[01:42:33.055 --> 01:42:37.019]  All right, and patrons like this who have a little bit of the funding to help us out make all the difference.
[01:42:37.019 --> 01:42:46.428]  So, so what's happening is, is like, I sent you a few cameras and some money, other people donate cameras, people come and donate the use of an RV, it's just whatever you need is coming together.
[01:42:46.428 --> 01:42:49.251]  Side by side, this is our, we are change partners.
[01:42:50.652 --> 01:42:52.633]  Crucial member of this organization.
[01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:59.257]  That's so exciting, but again, my point is that everybody together, you're finding the resources you need.
[01:42:59.257 --> 01:43:01.938]  Absolutely, and we're just starting this thing.
[01:43:01.938 --> 01:43:08.882]  You know, we started with a Stickum broadcast and we're evolving slowly but surely.
[01:43:08.882 --> 01:43:11.103]  And God knows where we will be in a week from now.
[01:43:11.103 --> 01:43:12.844]  Look what we've done in five, six weeks.
[01:43:12.844 --> 01:43:16.886]  Look what Luke started by himself with General Brzezinski, without a brother near him, okay?
[01:43:18.874 --> 01:43:23.581]  He went there with an hour's notice and went and attacked these people himself verbally, okay?
[01:43:23.581 --> 01:43:27.246]  And this is a revolution, and we have to understand that we have the power.
[01:43:27.246 --> 01:43:30.170]  One man can do it, but it doesn't need to be, alright?
[01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:35.497]  Every one of us can stand up to these people, and we're gonna get this white paper out there because you will be surprised, okay?
[01:43:35.797 --> 01:43:38.599]  How secure and how full of yourself do you feel when you have a camera on you?
[01:43:58.295 --> 01:43:59.296]  Yeah, man, it's been a crazy day.
[01:43:59.296 --> 01:44:01.156]  I mean, we have Mike Nara here, man.
[01:44:01.156 --> 01:44:03.117]  He's the one who really done most of the work here.
[01:44:03.117 --> 01:44:04.758]  He's the one who really organized everything here.
[01:44:19.717 --> 01:44:21.219]  And he was there, actually.
[01:44:21.219 --> 01:44:23.181]  He was watching the live feed from the RV.
[01:44:23.181 --> 01:44:25.504]  As soon as he found out they were arresting him, he ran there.
[01:44:25.504 --> 01:44:27.005]  And he had an inside perspective.
[01:44:27.005 --> 01:44:28.967]  The police actually also detained him.
[01:44:28.967 --> 01:44:31.350]  They detained Mike Knarr, one of our guys.
[01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:36.536]  Let me talk to Mike Knarr, and then we'll go back to somebody who was out there while this was happening.
[01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:38.618]  Mr. Cesar, Chris Cesar.
[01:44:38.618 --> 01:44:40.220]  Mike Knarr, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:44:41.289 --> 01:44:44.012]  I know you guys are passing the phone around.
[01:44:44.012 --> 01:44:45.214]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:44:45.214 --> 01:44:53.404]  Describe what you saw when you were watching it on the video stream cam in the RV over the wireless internet and then you ran out to see them being let out the front.
[01:44:53.404 --> 01:44:54.625]  Talk about from different angles.
[01:44:54.625 --> 01:44:55.787]  This is the future.
[01:44:55.787 --> 01:44:57.088]  Tell us what you witnessed.
[01:44:57.088 --> 01:45:00.713]  Well actually from the RV you know the feed was cutting a little bit in and out and we kind of went from a
[01:45:01.153 --> 01:45:05.697]  An interview to a pop-up of an audio saying, why am I being arrested?
[01:45:05.697 --> 01:45:12.563]  So we just reacted very quickly and I was acting kind of in the capacity of Luke's and Matt's producer on this.
[01:45:12.563 --> 01:45:28.077]  So I ran over there as fast as I could and you know by the time I got there I was pretty out of breath and I came on the scene there was already four cops that had Matt pinned up against the wall and I demanded to know as the producer
[01:45:28.776 --> 01:45:33.659]  Uh, why my man was being, uh, arrested and what charges were being filed against him.
[01:45:33.659 --> 01:45:46.845]  And, uh, I think what we have here is a local, you know, police force, you know, that just got themselves involved in something, you know, that they thought, you know, there's a big time operation, you know, I get to deal with Secret Service and all these, and they really got themselves in the middle of this thing.
[01:45:47.558 --> 01:45:49.079]  And I don't know how they're going to dig themselves out.
[01:45:49.079 --> 01:45:52.401]  Did it look like Secret Service was directing the arrest?
[01:45:52.401 --> 01:45:58.144]  Because when we called last night, we were told Secret Service was running it, and then we had to talk to them.
[01:45:58.144 --> 01:45:58.724]  Absolutely.
[01:45:58.724 --> 01:46:00.085]  Let me tell you exactly what happened.
[01:46:00.085 --> 01:46:01.646]  The chief of police was running around.
[01:46:02.359 --> 01:46:04.960]  Like a man, like a chicken with its head cut off, okay?
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:13.885]  He came down to the arresting area, and I was on my cell phone, I was telling... They were all baby Jack Bowers, this was their day to fight Al Qaeda.
[01:46:13.885 --> 01:46:27.491]  Exactly, and I was telling them I was on the cell phone with corporate, I was on the cell phone with legal, we're demanding to know exactly right now, this moment, we have live internet feeds that saw this whole thing go down, they were all on camera,
[01:46:27.871 --> 01:46:28.872]  We're good to go.
[01:46:48.462 --> 01:46:53.127]  And it was during this process that they were trying to explain how we were not legitimate media, okay?
[01:46:53.127 --> 01:46:56.531]  They were trying to figure out... They decide, and oh, you're asking questions.
[01:46:56.531 --> 01:46:58.193]  Arrest him, too!
[01:46:58.193 --> 01:47:00.155]  Well, here's the great thing.
[01:47:00.155 --> 01:47:06.242]  Up walks this man in a small party of people, and he says, hey, I'm looking for my dad, Ron Paul.
[01:47:07.413 --> 01:47:10.134]  Okay, so Ron Paul's son was standing, right?
[01:47:10.134 --> 01:47:14.474]  I said, you just came upon the scene, I said, you know where Alex Jones is?
[01:47:14.474 --> 01:47:18.855]  And the police are standing there, and they're like, of course we know who Alex Jones is!
[01:47:18.855 --> 01:47:22.256]  He's one of the biggest, you know, my dad's always on that show!
[01:47:22.256 --> 01:47:25.816]  And so, they're just sitting there with their mouths dropped.
[01:47:25.816 --> 01:47:27.476]  So Ron Paul's son is there?
[01:47:27.476 --> 01:47:30.837]  Ron Paul's son was immediately on the scene, yeah.
[01:47:30.837 --> 01:47:36.358]  Bedlam going on, yeah, I talked to his media guy, he already heard about it today, even before I got him on air.
[01:47:37.276 --> 01:47:38.817]  This is just total insanity.
[01:47:38.817 --> 01:47:49.722]  Yeah, I mean, he ran up the steps and, you know, he had a powwow with some people and then he came back down and I said, you know, you're telling me if I leave this position, you're going to arrest me?
[01:47:49.722 --> 01:47:53.423]  You know, he said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, now you're not detained.
[01:47:53.423 --> 01:47:54.284]  You can do anything you want.
[01:47:54.284 --> 01:47:56.845]  I said, now getting back to this charge, what is the charge again?
[01:47:57.718 --> 01:48:00.160]  We think it's going to be criminal trespassing.
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.483]  That's a license or privilege to enter a situation, okay?
[01:48:04.483 --> 01:48:07.645]  I mean, if you're at a bar and you cause a disruption, you're thrown out.
[01:48:07.645 --> 01:48:09.226]  That's disorderly conduct.
[01:48:09.226 --> 01:48:15.189]  If they tell you not to re-enter the bar, and you'd have to have the bar owner's permission, you know what I mean?
[01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:24.135]  You'd have to have a complainant that you are trespassing, then they have to ascertain you were not invited, and then they could do a basic trespass.
[01:48:24.135 --> 01:48:25.516]  Certainly not a criminal trespass.
[01:48:25.516 --> 01:48:26.837]  No, it's a false charge.
[01:48:27.077 --> 01:48:31.880]  Right, and exactly what Matt was trying to ascertain is who is the complainant?
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.421]  Who is the one directing this?
[01:48:33.421 --> 01:48:34.741]  Ansem College?
[01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:35.081]  CNN?
[01:48:35.081 --> 01:48:37.043]  And we know who it was.
[01:48:37.043 --> 01:48:39.344]  It was Giuliani goons.
[01:48:39.344 --> 01:48:45.067]  Some woman who was with his entourage, with the campaign, assaulted Luke and my equipment.
[01:48:45.872 --> 01:48:50.156]  Uh, and then she'd get herself out of trouble as some women have a tendency to do.
[01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:52.137]  She went and made up a story.
[01:48:52.137 --> 01:48:55.160]  Okay, they had a whisk Matt away because they knew.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:00.524]  So I told them, I said, you know, because the other media then started coming up and starting asking me questions.
[01:49:00.524 --> 01:49:01.365]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:49:01.365 --> 01:49:02.066]  We want to cover this.
[01:49:02.626 --> 01:49:04.287]  And so they had to get him out of there.
[01:49:22.198 --> 01:49:22.579]  Absolutely.
[01:49:22.579 --> 01:49:22.919]  Sure.
[01:49:22.919 --> 01:49:24.800]  My blog is just chriscaeser.gather.com.
[01:49:51.323 --> 01:49:53.705]  ChrisCaesar.gather.com.
[01:49:53.705 --> 01:49:54.345]  That's right.
[01:49:54.345 --> 01:49:56.286]  ChrisCaesar.gather.com.
[01:49:56.286 --> 01:49:58.027]  Sir, thank you for sending those photos.
[01:49:58.027 --> 01:49:58.948]  We will get them up.
[01:49:58.948 --> 01:50:00.929]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:50:00.929 --> 01:50:05.652]  Just that I asked the woman that made the charge, you know, why she did it.
[01:50:05.652 --> 01:50:08.173]  Didn't she think that... Oh, stay there!
[01:50:08.173 --> 01:50:09.694]  You saw the goon!
[01:50:09.694 --> 01:50:11.235]  Oh my gosh, this is huge.
[01:50:11.235 --> 01:50:14.657]  We're getting all the pieces with these witnesses right here now.
[01:50:14.657 --> 01:50:15.398]  Publicly.
[01:50:15.398 --> 01:50:15.858]  Stay there.
[01:50:22.117 --> 01:50:27.947]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:27.947 --> 01:50:35.600]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:36.283 --> 01:50:43.725]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:43.725 --> 01:50:55.468]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:55.468 --> 01:50:59.429]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:59.429 --> 01:51:01.710]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:51:01.710 --> 01:51:05.551]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:18.886 --> 01:51:19.807]  Terrorism.
[01:51:19.807 --> 01:51:20.667]  Terrorism.
[01:51:20.667 --> 01:51:26.992]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:51:26.992 --> 01:51:28.833]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:51:28.833 --> 01:51:31.695]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:51:31.695 --> 01:51:46.304]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:51:46.304 --> 01:51:46.785]  government.
[01:51:46.785 --> 01:51:48.506]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.

[01:51:55.010 --> 01:51:59.773]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:52:33.587 --> 01:52:38.689]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:38.689 --> 01:52:47.632]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:53:26.169 --> 01:53:31.915]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.915 --> 01:53:35.159]  Alright, the next hour I'm going straight into the huge immigration news.
[01:53:35.159 --> 01:53:38.343]  It is massive, it is of the utmost importance.
[01:53:38.343 --> 01:53:40.785]  20 loopholes in it, biggest amnesty ever.
[01:53:40.785 --> 01:53:44.590]  Cities now issuing ID cards to illegals outside the matricula.
[01:53:45.799 --> 01:53:48.922]  Up in Farmer's Branch, they tried to block the illegals taking over.
[01:53:48.922 --> 01:53:55.969]  Federal judge, a state judge said, no way, total legalization by fiat, criminality everywhere by the government.
[01:53:55.969 --> 01:53:56.730]  It's not our government.
[01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:58.952]  It works for foreign interest to bring down the U.S.
[01:53:58.952 --> 01:54:01.835]  and a bunch of idiot police and bureaucrats don't know that.
[01:54:01.835 --> 01:54:03.697]  We're here to wake you up if you'll listen.
[01:54:03.697 --> 01:54:05.018]  You're destroying your own future.
[01:54:05.018 --> 01:54:08.181]  You're literally cutting your nose off despite your face.
[01:54:08.181 --> 01:54:08.921]  Let's go back to
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:17.625]  Our guest, who is a writer for a local newspaper, also has his own blog, and he's Chris Caesar.
[01:54:17.625 --> 01:54:22.889]  Chris, you ended up talking, I guess, afterwards to the lady that was going after Luke's camera.
[01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:24.751]  Did you see that?
[01:54:24.751 --> 01:54:27.233]  A. B. When you came up later to her, what did she say?
[01:54:27.233 --> 01:54:29.515]  I didn't see her take the camera.
[01:54:29.515 --> 01:54:33.798]  I saw the camera get broken when they arrested Matt.
[01:54:33.798 --> 01:54:34.699]  I mean, that's a separate one.
[01:54:34.699 --> 01:54:37.821]  I mean, whenever she was at first going after Luke and the camera.
[01:54:38.869 --> 01:54:46.515]  Yeah, she definitely made a gesture, and I think it was the same woman I saw afterwards who was talking to police and wanted a statement from her.
[01:54:46.515 --> 01:54:49.618]  So I assume that she definitely made the complaint.
[01:54:49.618 --> 01:54:56.903]  And I just asked her, you know, don't you think that they would have been less... because she was telling him that they were being antagonistic and stuff.
[01:54:56.903 --> 01:55:03.669]  And I said, don't you think they would have been a lot more polite and respectful if the campaign staffer answered the question?
[01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:07.652]  And she looked at me like I was from Mars and said, you know, what question?
[01:55:09.033 --> 01:55:13.658]  Well, number one, who is she to be going around ordering people to be arrested?
[01:55:13.658 --> 01:55:14.679]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:55:14.679 --> 01:55:16.020]  Did you get her name tag?
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:17.482]  What was her name?
[01:55:17.482 --> 01:55:19.264]  She didn't have a name tag, unfortunately.
[01:55:19.264 --> 01:55:25.190]  I might have her voice very faintly on my tape recorder here, but I couldn't identify her.
[01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:27.252]  Man, upload that if you can.
[01:55:27.252 --> 01:55:27.913]  You are awesome.
[01:55:27.913 --> 01:55:29.935]  We'll put it up on YouTube or Google.
[01:55:29.935 --> 01:55:31.276]  And again, I really appreciate you.
[01:55:31.276 --> 01:55:31.737]  Anything else?
[01:55:33.463 --> 01:55:42.051]  Not that I can think of, just that I told Ron Paul about it when it came out afterwards, and he commented that, you know, aren't we supposed to be spreading democracy across the world?
[01:55:42.051 --> 01:55:43.532]  We can't even handle it here in New Hampshire.
[01:55:44.384 --> 01:55:46.085]  Wow, so Ron Paul had that statement.
[01:55:46.085 --> 01:55:47.726]  Can you upload that?
[01:55:47.726 --> 01:55:48.667]  Yes, sir, I can.
[01:55:48.667 --> 01:55:49.447]  You are the best.
[01:55:49.447 --> 01:55:50.388]  Put it up on your blog.
[01:55:50.388 --> 01:55:52.149]  We'll link to your blog, my friend.
[01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.750]  Thank you, sir.
[01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:53.630]  That is awesome.
[01:55:53.630 --> 01:55:54.491]  No, thank you.
[01:55:54.491 --> 01:55:55.652]  This is wonderful.
[01:55:55.652 --> 01:55:58.413]  I can go to so many angles, so many different people.
[01:55:58.413 --> 01:56:00.035]  This is real media.
[01:56:00.035 --> 01:56:00.875]  I am so blessed.
[01:56:00.875 --> 01:56:04.538]  Thank you, God, for putting me in this position to fight this corruption.
[01:56:04.538 --> 01:56:09.621]  We've let Luke and Matt and all of them go, correct?
[01:56:09.621 --> 01:56:11.802]  John?
[01:56:11.802 --> 01:56:12.643]  They're Sayonara.
[01:56:12.643 --> 01:56:13.964]  We've let the other guys go, right?
[01:56:15.111 --> 01:56:16.072]  Okay, just tell them thank you.
[01:56:16.072 --> 01:56:17.494]  We're going to get them back up tomorrow.
[01:56:17.494 --> 01:56:20.198]  Let's schedule them.
[01:56:20.198 --> 01:56:24.524]  Get my producer with them because I want to get them all set back up again tomorrow as more of this develops.
[01:56:24.524 --> 01:56:27.428]  A couple of program notes.
[01:56:27.428 --> 01:56:29.851]  I've been so busy this week.
