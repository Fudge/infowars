[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.222]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:13.002]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:15.323]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:18.604]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:22.345]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.766]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:28.567]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:38.726]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.151]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:43.811]  Welcome.
[00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:46.794]  It is the 17th day of June 2007.
[00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:51.518]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours, roughly.
[00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:55.062]  We will have open phones for you today.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:10.630]  The toll-free number to join us anywhere around the country, listing on the AM or FM dial, Internet Satellite or shortwave, 877-590-5525, 877-590-KLBJ.
[00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:20.238]  After the mothership station, we broadcast out on this radio, 590-KLBJ, here in Austin, Texas, and locally in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:26.824]  You're always welcome to drop me a call there as well, and there's a message board on the
[00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:35.491]  On the Homebase Station's website, 590KLBJ.com, we'll be looking at that message board and perhaps going over some of those questions or comments today.
[00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:53.682]  I was up at about three in the morning last night working and it's always in the late evening or early morning hours that you can be more reflective and just really honestly look at what we face and what's happening with our society.
[00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:58.740]  And I think the easiest way to describe this is matrix-like.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.460]  It's matrix-like.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.042]  It's one cannot be told about the matrix, one must see it for themselves.
[00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:24.610]  How many of you, who even think you know about the New World Order, consciously understand that in plain view, over 75% of all the taxes you pay have been delivered directly to private, predominantly offshore corporations?
[00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:45.456]  And that over 75% of the taxes, all the many, many different types of taxes, really over 50 of them that the average person pays, depending on the state you live in, that since the end of World War II, that is taken directly and put into global corporations that are now bigger than most nations.
[00:02:46.317 --> 00:02:48.339]  And that those corporations publicly
[00:02:48.923 --> 00:02:58.187]  ...are working to destroy the sovereignty of the United States in the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and they openly admit it in public policy papers.
[00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:04.550]  Or that they publicly admit that they have bought up over 200 refineries in the U.S.
[00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.872]  and shut them down to artificially raise gas prices.
[00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:12.294]  How many of you know this?
[00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:14.755]  This is absolute fact.
[00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:16.996]  It's called the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:22.969]  That's the gateway to learn of the real world, of the magician behind the curtain in the land of Oz.
[00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.091]  Now, when it comes to the true financial architecture of the world.
[00:03:29.652 --> 00:03:38.997]  See, we all operate and live within that very narrow spectrum where we're supposed to live and be informed and invest.
[00:03:39.657 --> 00:03:45.400]  And that is just a very small area of the total financial world architecture.
[00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:49.282]  And now, they've got more than 75% of the wealth.
[00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:52.263]  The middle class of the world is extremely tiny.
[00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:53.964]  Yet again, they've reached their goal.
[00:03:54.944 --> 00:03:57.505]  And they don't need free market anymore.
[00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:59.206]  They don't need freedom anymore.
[00:03:59.786 --> 00:04:04.047]  And the New World Order architects are moving to set up a hellish planet.
[00:04:05.688 --> 00:04:13.831]  And they confuse you with different flavors of liberal, different flavors of conservative, and debates of little or no significance that literally mean nothing, or next to nothing.
[00:04:15.027 --> 00:04:17.928]  And they are now moving in with their final phase.
[00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.332]  What hit me was I was doing the final voiceover for my film, Endgame.
[00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:31.594]  Because what I do is I write a basic outline, but I don't really script my documentaries.
[00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:36.676]  As I make them over a year plus period, I collate the data, I have the latest information.
[00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:40.278]  I mean, when my film comes out, it'll have stuff in it from a week before.
[00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:46.007]  I mean, I'm constantly going back and adding the newest info.
[00:04:46.968 --> 00:05:02.817]  And there with all my years of studying how many people governments have killed, I was looking at official State Department, official Chinese government, official Russian archives, the admission is over 200 million people killed by government last century alone.
[00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:04.178]  Over 200 million.
[00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:09.477]  Now, about 100 million of those were forcibly, by design, starved to death.
[00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:13.480]  The other 100 million or so were shot or hung.
[00:05:17.743 --> 00:05:28.491]  And it's just unbelievable to realize that the number one cause of non-natural death, that is cancer, heart attacks, things like that, are natural.
[00:05:29.692 --> 00:05:33.074]  The number one cause of non-natural death
[00:05:34.022 --> 00:05:35.063]  Without any debate.
[00:05:35.223 --> 00:05:37.444]  I went and pulled the numbers from the World Almanac.
[00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.085]  I did a lot of number crunching last night.
[00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.806]  Above everything is government.
[00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:46.489]  Government is just an absolute scourge on humanity.
[00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.770]  And it is an absolute nightmare.
[00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:56.154]  And there have been thousands of corrupt, tyrannical governments in the last 6,000 years of civilization.
[00:05:56.594 --> 00:06:00.136]  Since man set up city-states and nation-states and empires.
[00:06:00.956 --> 00:06:09.621]  There have been thousands of corrupt empires, thousands of corrupt leaders, and there have been less than ten semi-free societies.
[00:06:10.742 --> 00:06:29.573]  Now, if you think you can sit there and do nothing but watch football, and nothing but go to topless bars, and nothing but party, and nothing but go out on your boat, and nothing but smoke pot and drink whiskey, and live in a free society, and just giggle and laugh at everything, you've got another thing coming.
[00:06:30.985 --> 00:06:31.325]  Okay?
[00:06:31.905 --> 00:06:33.746]  Now, I'm not saying you can't go out on your boat.
[00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:34.826]  I'm not saying you can't drink a beer.
[00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:36.967]  My point is that's all you do.
[00:06:37.227 --> 00:06:45.810]  You know all the football scores, but you don't know anything about history or anything about the world architecture or what the elite are saying they're going to do.
[00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:52.752]  And for those of you that say it can't happen here, it won't happen here, it isn't going to happen here,
[00:06:54.933 --> 00:07:01.999]  Every top law professor out there on both sides of the false political paradigm say we're going into tyranny.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.364]  Even the UN put out a report today saying that the West is going into pure fascism.
[00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.506]  Of course, that's how these tyrants do it, though.
[00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:10.867]  They'll report on the other tyrant.
[00:07:11.408 --> 00:07:15.031]  The fascists will report on the communists, and the communists will report on the fascists.
[00:07:17.384 --> 00:07:21.606]  But bottom line, we have a corrupt elite completely out of control right now.
[00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:24.087]  Just absolutely out of control.
[00:07:24.187 --> 00:07:27.169]  And you and your family mean absolutely nothing to them.
[00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.573]  I want today to talk about the so-called immigration reform bill.
[00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:37.534]  I have a copy of the bill.
[00:07:37.674 --> 00:07:39.535]  This has only been public now for about a week and a half.
[00:07:41.036 --> 00:07:42.597]  And it was worse than we had first thought.
[00:07:42.637 --> 00:07:43.657]  I talked about that last week.
[00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:45.358]  But more than just the immigration bill,
[00:07:46.522 --> 00:07:51.507]  And how they keep resurrecting it on a daily basis, and how that's a psychological warfare tactic.
[00:07:51.807 --> 00:08:01.196]  I want to cover what it means that we have over 90% of Americans in major Gallup polls against it, and that the government, both parties, don't care and are doing it anyways.
[00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:12.406]  And what it means for the mainstream media, who's still acting like everyone's for it, and trying to spin it.
[00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:42.627]  And I wanted to bring that in and connect that in with the denial by conservatives in this country, because I was on town hall today and a bunch of other big sites, and I noticed that they were saying, Ron Paul isn't a conservative, he's bad, he's not good for America, they're real conservatives, and there is no NAU, there is no North American Union, the immigration bill's good, it's not amnesty, and they're counting on you folks not reading the bill.
[00:08:43.553 --> 00:08:44.893]  I mean, they lie to you.
[00:08:46.094 --> 00:08:46.794]  They lie to you.
[00:08:46.834 --> 00:08:50.955]  They sit there and tell you they're conservative all day long when they're not.
[00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:54.656]  I mean, Free Republic, Town Hall, Human Events, all of them.
[00:08:55.296 --> 00:08:56.597]  They're not stupid, folks.
[00:08:56.677 --> 00:08:57.537]  They know.
[00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:07.900]  They know that they're lying to you, and they know that most of you are not going to go pull up the bill.
[00:09:11.249 --> 00:09:15.730]  And it's just mind-blowing to me that they'll just sit there and lie to you.
[00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.091]  And you won't be insulted by that.
[00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:23.111]  And the same thing goes for the fake left in this country.
[00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:26.572]  Global warming man-made is such a fraud, even if you believe in it.
[00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:28.713]  Carbon tax is a global tax.
[00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:31.753]  It's a new system of taxation and feudalism.
[00:09:32.313 --> 00:09:33.774]  One-child policy, you name it.
[00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:35.574]  And you don't even know that.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.180]  Let me get back.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.981]  I'm going to go into this.
[00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:41.482]  There's been open calls by Trent White to start shutting down talk radio.
[00:09:41.502 --> 00:09:43.503]  The Republican Party is very upset.
[00:09:44.204 --> 00:09:46.145]  And Tony Blair is calling for shutting down the internet.
[00:09:46.165 --> 00:09:46.625]  Free speech.
[00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:48.146]  We'll tell you about it, folks.
[00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:49.386]  It's serious news.
[00:09:49.926 --> 00:09:50.427]  Stay with us.
[00:09:50.447 --> 00:09:50.987]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:06.822]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:10:07.162 --> 00:10:09.124]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:17.130]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:24.890]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:36.678]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:40.541]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:40.961 --> 00:10:42.923]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:47.086]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:02.415 --> 00:11:05.937]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:11:07.138 --> 00:11:11.961]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:14.902]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:11:14.942 --> 00:11:16.023]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:21.984]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:11:22.905 --> 00:11:30.170]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.253]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:39.856]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:11:40.837 --> 00:11:42.098]  Call for your copy today.
[00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:42.338]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:45.598 --> 00:11:51.442]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:11:52.023 --> 00:11:52.203]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:52.223 --> 00:11:52.523]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:04.330]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.471]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:10.171]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:12:10.792 --> 00:12:19.094]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:20.115]  An example?
[00:12:20.655 --> 00:12:23.496]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:27.137]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:12:27.517 --> 00:12:30.758]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:36.741]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:38.861]  Money is not the problem.
[00:12:39.082 --> 00:12:40.082]  Availability is.
[00:12:40.582 --> 00:12:42.443]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[00:12:42.703 --> 00:12:46.364]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:12:46.984 --> 00:12:49.125]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[00:12:49.165 --> 00:12:50.045]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:12:50.065 --> 00:12:50.105]  800-409-5633.
[00:13:00.618 --> 00:13:03.339]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:09.460]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.081]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:13:12.261 --> 00:13:21.463]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:13:21.763 --> 00:13:26.004]  With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the helping hand it needs
[00:13:26.124 --> 00:13:26.524]  I think so.
[00:13:43.596 --> 00:13:45.216]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:13:45.236 --> 00:13:46.077]  Well, search no more!
[00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:46.817]  We are the GCN Radio Network!
[00:14:12.344 --> 00:14:15.225]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:18.547]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:20.648 --> 00:14:26.691]  I know we've got calls from as far away as Canada and Michigan, USA.
[00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:31.414]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:14:32.474 --> 00:14:38.017]  And I'm going to detail some of the things I'm about to talk about more later in the next hour and 40 minutes that we've got left here.
[00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:42.590]  But I want to go over some facts.
[00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:47.091]  I know several times in the last few weeks I've covered the 20 loopholes in the immigration bill.
[00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:47.932]  They're not loopholes.
[00:14:48.892 --> 00:14:51.513]  A loophole is something that, you know, built into it so you can get out of it.
[00:14:52.073 --> 00:14:53.214]  This thing is an amnesty.
[00:14:53.494 --> 00:14:54.454]  It's true that they say that.
[00:14:54.514 --> 00:14:56.895]  It's complete capitulation and the end of the country.
[00:14:57.276 --> 00:14:57.756]  Literally.
[00:14:58.536 --> 00:14:59.977]  And I'm not the only person saying that.
[00:15:00.037 --> 00:15:02.498]  You really should go read this bill for yourself.
[00:15:03.398 --> 00:15:05.579]  But the big news here is that
[00:15:07.051 --> 00:15:24.856]  The New York Times a few weeks ago came out and admitted that the states are lobbying and big telecommunications companies are lobbying to literally end the internet, to end net neutrality where you can't travel around where you want, when you want, whole sections of the web being hacked off and private domains and deals with major corporations.
[00:15:26.397 --> 00:15:30.218]  Just a couple years ago, Level 3 and Cogent, two big internet backbone
[00:15:31.207 --> 00:15:36.150]  Relay systems had a fight with each other and about 40% of the web was inaccessible.
[00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.731]  Remember that?
[00:15:36.751 --> 00:15:37.231]  Remember that?
[00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:38.712]  Maybe you don't.
[00:15:39.933 --> 00:15:54.582]  But this is very, very serious and enforcing us on the Internet, too, where you waive your rights, where you don't have free speech, where you've got to register yourself, where you've got to have a subdomain under 50 corporations or 50 universities that are part of a hundred group.
[00:15:54.982 --> 00:15:56.123]  It's a controlled monopoly.
[00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:56.463]  It's like
[00:15:57.003 --> 00:16:03.407]  What Texas is doing, handing over our existing roads to some foreign company to throw toll booths on it and tax you.
[00:16:03.467 --> 00:16:04.188]  It's just looting.
[00:16:05.549 --> 00:16:06.549]  That's how they operate.
[00:16:06.569 --> 00:16:09.491]  And the New York Times said, yes, there are bills to tax email.
[00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:11.733]  Yes, there are bills to start shutting down the web.
[00:16:12.173 --> 00:16:12.473]  Okay?
[00:16:12.493 --> 00:16:13.694]  And they were all for it, of course.
[00:16:17.367 --> 00:16:24.652]  One of the Senate leaders in the Republican Party, Trent Lott, is in a New York Times article today titled, Senate Leaders Agree to Revive Immigration Bill.
[00:16:24.672 --> 00:16:26.373]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:16:26.393 --> 00:16:28.935]  You can go to Drudge and link through to it as well.
[00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:33.038]  He's changed the headline to link to Trent Lott Tax Talk Radio.
[00:16:33.078 --> 00:16:36.460]  But you read his actual quote, he says that talk radio
[00:16:37.439 --> 00:16:45.985]  Hate radio is running America today, and so we've got to start regulating it and controlling it, exactly what Hillary Clinton and others have been talking about.
[00:16:46.285 --> 00:16:50.048]  And hey, since the mid-eighties, folks, you know, we've had quote, free speech on talk radio.
[00:16:50.248 --> 00:16:51.829]  People think, you know, they can never take it away.
[00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:55.011]  It didn't exist before, until people challenged it in the courts.
[00:16:55.311 --> 00:16:56.772]  It's called the Fairness Doctrine.
[00:16:57.483 --> 00:17:06.707]  If I got up here and said Al Gore is a piece of trash, or George Bush is a piece of filth, or they're a bunch of scallywags, then, whoa, someone could demand political equal time.
[00:17:07.007 --> 00:17:08.187]  Now, I got free speech.
[00:17:08.968 --> 00:17:10.288]  By the way, the genie's out of the bottle.
[00:17:10.568 --> 00:17:12.289]  You guys can try this all day long.
[00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:14.550]  Just keep showing everybody who you are.
[00:17:15.245 --> 00:17:27.873]  The scary thing is they've got the major newspaper associations behind them, they've even got a lot of the big talk radio associations behind them, they've got the big TV network execs behind them, all over the planet, not just in the US, and I've got those articles here in front of me today.
[00:17:28.413 --> 00:17:28.794]  Why?
[00:17:28.954 --> 00:17:41.842]  Because alternative media is taking over the old media, literally merging with it, and because old media can't survive unless they do it, and it's simply even dwarfing those mergers.
[00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:49.999]  And the exponential growth of alternative media is so straight up in its growth curve
[00:17:52.213 --> 00:18:00.198]  But it's like the old line, old guard noticing a tsunami tidal wave is hitting them when it's a hundred yards from their front porch on the beach.
[00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:01.639]  There's no running!
[00:18:01.879 --> 00:18:03.440]  There's nothing you can do!
[00:18:03.921 --> 00:18:06.222]  I just want to give you that little newsflash.
[00:18:06.302 --> 00:18:12.566]  I've studied history and trends, and I've also looked at all the big government analysis of this, and you can try to even unplug the whole web.
[00:18:13.006 --> 00:18:13.747]  It isn't going to work.
[00:18:13.787 --> 00:18:15.348]  You can't put perfume on a pig.
[00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:19.991]  But yeah, Senate leaders agree to revive the immigration bill.
[00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:22.529]  That's a whole other tactic right there.
[00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:28.530]  Remember, I told you three weeks ago, I told you last week, I said, watch, it's not dead, it'll be reintroduced.
[00:18:29.451 --> 00:18:30.631]  And it wasn't a hard call.
[00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:32.932]  They did that with campaign finance reform.
[00:18:33.332 --> 00:18:36.113]  Just because they use the word reform doesn't mean it's good.
[00:18:36.593 --> 00:18:38.093]  Reform just means to change.
[00:18:39.354 --> 00:18:41.935]  Well, I mean, if you gain a hundred pounds, is that a good reform?
[00:18:41.975 --> 00:18:44.335]  No, you've just been reformed.
[00:18:44.675 --> 00:18:49.337]  But semantically, we've been taught to believe the word reform means it's good.
[00:18:50.208 --> 00:18:54.290]  Folks, probably one of the worst things in there isn't just that it allows aggravated felons.
[00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.291]  That means hardcore rapists.
[00:18:56.331 --> 00:18:57.071]  It says it in the bill.
[00:18:59.212 --> 00:19:01.693]  Felons, armed robbers, to be instantly legalized.
[00:19:01.813 --> 00:19:02.173]  Instantly.
[00:19:02.494 --> 00:19:05.175]  Given a social security card, legalized for 12 years, boom.
[00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:07.996]  Worse than the previous bill, it was for six years.
[00:19:09.517 --> 00:19:12.578]  No, one of the worst things is five years, no taxes.
[00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.059]  Back taxes, waived.
[00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.740]  It has pardon provisions in it.
[00:19:19.302 --> 00:19:28.950]  Uh, I remember my dad basically having everything he had, even though I remember him going, my God, I paid him and the accountants out of the lawyers to do the retroactive 89 tax law and came back and said, you owe all this.
[00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:29.391]  Remember that?
[00:19:29.411 --> 00:19:31.753]  I remember seeing my dad have everything he had taken.
[00:19:32.173 --> 00:19:37.138]  He didn't get what the Mexicans are going to get or what the Russians are going to get or what any other illegal aliens are going to get.
[00:19:37.418 --> 00:19:40.801]  Because again, Americans, it's open season on us.
[00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:45.005]  Just like cops pull you over and you're an illegal alien, don't have a driver's license, they let you go.
[00:19:45.346 --> 00:19:46.227]  It's admitted.
[00:19:46.247 --> 00:19:49.191]  If you're a citizen, you might get your head slammed in the car.
[00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:51.294]  Because you're here to be run over.
[00:19:51.554 --> 00:19:52.715]  You're here to be spit on.
[00:19:52.956 --> 00:19:54.518]  You're here to be treated like trash.
[00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:56.220]  You're here to be run over.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.342]  You understand that?
[00:19:57.998 --> 00:19:58.919]  Because you're stupid!
[00:19:59.159 --> 00:19:59.840]  You're fat!
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.381]  And I mean psychologically you're fat.
[00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:02.161]  You're slovenly.
[00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:03.602]  You think everything's owed to you.
[00:20:03.723 --> 00:20:04.703]  You think you've got rights.
[00:20:04.863 --> 00:20:05.944]  You've been living in denial.
[00:20:05.964 --> 00:20:08.827]  Oh, they've been building concentration camps all around you!
[00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:10.828]  And finally it's in the Houston Chronicle!
[00:20:11.288 --> 00:20:12.910]  And saying we need to get rid of free speech!
[00:20:14.591 --> 00:20:16.513]  Do you understand how late in the game it is?
[00:20:19.575 --> 00:20:20.315]  But here's the deal.
[00:20:20.656 --> 00:20:27.181]  Not only is Trent Lott saying restrict talk radio today, Tony Blair, now folks, the birthplace of modern free speech,
[00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:30.302]  Literally 800 years ago in 1215.
[00:20:30.342 --> 00:20:34.243]  790-something years ago.
[00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:35.524]  It run in me.
[00:20:35.544 --> 00:20:37.184]  If you don't know what it is, you better learn about it.
[00:20:39.925 --> 00:20:40.565]  Was England.
[00:20:41.966 --> 00:20:45.507]  Now Tony Blair, when he got elected in the late 90's, said, I'm getting rid of the Magna Carta.
[00:20:45.767 --> 00:20:46.607]  And man, he meant it.
[00:20:46.647 --> 00:20:47.948]  I remember reading that in the BBC.
[00:20:48.508 --> 00:20:51.489]  He gave a speech saying, we're getting rid of the Magna Carta.
[00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.670]  Now that's what the Bill of Rights is based on.
[00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.510]  He just came right out and said it.
[00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.591]  And you know what?
[00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:57.471]  He's done it, folks.
[00:20:58.607 --> 00:21:01.469]  They arrest you if you criticize the government now in England.
[00:21:01.489 --> 00:21:02.069]  You don't believe me?
[00:21:02.089 --> 00:21:03.130]  I have hundreds of articles.
[00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.911]  And the articles are saying it's good.
[00:21:07.313 --> 00:21:08.594]  Folks, I've been in England.
[00:21:09.014 --> 00:21:13.437]  I've been in England two years ago, and they walk right up and say, I'm taking your name down, putting you in a terror database.
[00:21:13.737 --> 00:21:16.019]  You're not allowed to even be out here walking around the streets with a camera.
[00:21:16.219 --> 00:21:18.461]  With just millions of cameras aimed at the people of London.
[00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:21.503]  Now they're making it even more draconian.
[00:21:21.763 --> 00:21:23.764]  They call it hate speech if you criticize the government.
[00:21:23.964 --> 00:21:25.705]  See, it starts with some minority group.
[00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:26.906]  You go, oh, that sounds reasonable.
[00:21:27.146 --> 00:21:27.807]  And then it's everything.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.242]  Here is Tony Blair, Blair Black's new online journalism regulator.
[00:21:33.882 --> 00:21:37.023]  That is a speech he gave, he's about to leave office.
[00:21:37.523 --> 00:21:49.828]  Tony Blair comes right out, gives a speech at a media convention to Reuters, and he says that new restrictions on internet journalism
[00:21:50.632 --> 00:21:58.256]  Shang that has become more pernicious and less balanced, and he said, let me read you the exact quote, that the alternative media behaves like a feral beast.
[00:21:58.276 --> 00:21:59.216]  That means you don't control us.
[00:21:59.596 --> 00:22:00.257]  Yeah, we are feral.
[00:22:01.417 --> 00:22:05.919]  But he had particularly harsh words for the non-traditional media outlets, particularly the internet.
[00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:09.581]  I used to be thought, and I included myself in this, this was a help on the horizon.
[00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:15.824]  New forms of communications will provide new outlets to bypass the increasingly shrill tenor of the traditional media.
[00:22:17.046 --> 00:22:23.893]  In fact, the new forms can be even more pernicious, less balanced, more intent on the latest conspiracy theory multiplied by five.
[00:22:24.654 --> 00:22:30.019]  Now this is a guy who's admittedly taken money and bribes publicly.
[00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:32.841]  And he's mad about that and he wants to be able to shut the media down.
[00:22:33.202 --> 00:22:35.544]  He's already issuing denotices to the mainstream media.
[00:22:35.764 --> 00:22:37.546]  They don't have free speech now in the media in England.
[00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:38.987]  Now he wants to shut the web down.
[00:22:40.129 --> 00:22:40.309]  Okay?
[00:22:41.241 --> 00:22:42.682]  Now, now, they're not playing games.
[00:22:42.702 --> 00:22:47.286]  When we get back, we'll tell you what this traitor, the latest thing he's done is, and how it ties into the U.S.
[00:23:00.689 --> 00:23:04.772]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:23:04.972 --> 00:23:08.395]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:23:08.555 --> 00:23:12.078]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:23:12.278 --> 00:23:15.581]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:19.924]  This basic tenant of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we
[00:23:20.825 --> 00:23:21.465]  We're good to go.
[00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:42.532]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:23:42.612 --> 00:23:43.973]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:23:44.133 --> 00:23:47.955]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[00:24:01.225 --> 00:24:04.767]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:24:04.827 --> 00:24:05.347]  are located?
[00:24:05.547 --> 00:24:08.928]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:24:09.148 --> 00:24:13.870]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:26:01.307 --> 00:26:07.072]  Millions of people suffer daily with back pain, hip pain, leg pain, sciatica, poor posture and more.
[00:26:07.492 --> 00:26:12.656]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home anytime you need to help relieve the pain and not just treat the symptoms?
[00:26:13.296 --> 00:26:19.341]  All of these people are relaxing on a unique device placed under the hips to elevate the sacrum and let tight muscles relax.
[00:26:19.841 --> 00:26:23.404]  It's called the Sacroedgy.
[00:26:23.524 --> 00:26:28.348]  And was invented by a sports trainer to first help his athletes and now is helping thousands.
[00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:35.325]  The Sacro Wedgie is not a quick fix, but a lifestyle and can even be used sitting at a desk or in the car.
[00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:36.946]  Of course, results will vary.
[00:26:37.166 --> 00:26:40.289]  However, the more balanced you are, the fewer problems you'll have.
[00:26:40.749 --> 00:26:42.510]  Relax 20 minutes daily for relief.
[00:26:42.871 --> 00:26:47.474]  It only costs $29.95 for the Sacro Wedgie and $12.95 for the Neck Roll.
[00:26:47.854 --> 00:26:52.558]  Visit our website at www.sacrowedgie.com or call 1-800-737-9295 for a free brochure.
[00:26:52.578 --> 00:26:54.179]  The Sacro Wedgie works when all else fails.
[00:27:00.683 --> 00:27:07.325]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:27:07.365 --> 00:27:12.046]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:27:12.206 --> 00:27:13.907]  Raging for the truth.
[00:27:14.107 --> 00:27:15.567]  Exposing corruption.
[00:27:16.147 --> 00:27:19.548]  Dismantling a false left-right paradigm.
[00:27:19.808 --> 00:27:21.409]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:26.562]  Yeah, our phone system crashed out with all the callers on it.
[00:27:27.002 --> 00:27:35.104]  We went to the backup, so if you want to call back in at 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525, we'll get you up on the air.
[00:27:35.124 --> 00:27:41.245]  If you're listening locally in Central Texas, off the mothership station that we broadcast out of, it's 836-0590.
[00:27:41.365 --> 00:27:46.706]  And we'll get those calls names lined back up and get you back up on air here.
[00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:48.106]  Appreciate the folks in there doing that.
[00:27:49.227 --> 00:27:51.207]  Let me cover some news right now.
[00:27:52.566 --> 00:28:03.973]  Listen, I'm not joking about these White House memos where they're so degenerate and so evil that they say, yeah, we can torture small children in front of their families, and then it came out that they do do that.
[00:28:04.473 --> 00:28:08.215]  And I don't mean the public camp, the military laboratory.
[00:28:08.435 --> 00:28:09.996]  They admit it's a torture laboratory.
[00:28:10.016 --> 00:28:11.677]  They know everybody's innocent there.
[00:28:12.718 --> 00:28:17.681]  The CIA deputy director went public a couple of years ago.
[00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:19.482]  In fact, we interviewed the CIA section chief.
[00:28:20.459 --> 00:28:22.600]  Who was over the Afghan operations in the war.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.681]  This is directly from him.
[00:28:24.641 --> 00:28:30.885]  And they just admitted that they knew that the Taliban would just go grab whole villages that literally didn't even know where the U.S.
[00:28:30.925 --> 00:28:37.648]  was on a map or part of nothing and sell them for between $5,000 and $24,000 a piece per person.
[00:28:37.748 --> 00:28:41.210]  Boys as young as 11 and up to old men.
[00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.271]  And they were totally innocent.
[00:28:42.291 --> 00:28:46.473]  And they would just load them on C-130s and fly them out to Gitmo for torture testing.
[00:28:47.014 --> 00:28:49.116]  Where they have a CIA laboratory internally.
[00:28:49.816 --> 00:28:50.957]  This is mainstream news, by the way.
[00:28:50.998 --> 00:28:52.419]  Don't roll your neocon eyes.
[00:28:52.459 --> 00:28:53.840]  I want you to face up to your evil.
[00:28:54.741 --> 00:28:55.441]  Knowingly.
[00:28:55.461 --> 00:28:57.143]  Those real kids tried to get us.
[00:28:57.423 --> 00:28:57.864]  No, they weren't.
[00:28:57.904 --> 00:28:59.645]  Even if you believe the fairy tale about 9-11.
[00:29:00.266 --> 00:29:01.226]  These renaissance people.
[00:29:01.847 --> 00:29:03.408]  So what, let them die like it?
[00:29:03.889 --> 00:29:04.549]  Safe, you're tough.
[00:29:04.589 --> 00:29:06.571]  Well, you're going to be safe too with everything you've got.
[00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:09.534]  So you think, when you don't care about other people, you think you're going to be safe?
[00:29:09.734 --> 00:29:10.475]  That's what I do.
[00:29:10.695 --> 00:29:11.195]  Well, good then.
[00:29:11.215 --> 00:29:11.976]  Just go ahead then.
[00:29:12.864 --> 00:29:13.584]  You little punks!
[00:29:14.065 --> 00:29:15.826]  But I want you to know, you're scum and you're weak!
[00:29:16.326 --> 00:29:18.787]  And you don't know history and you don't know how dangerous the world is!
[00:29:19.588 --> 00:29:24.511]  My God, just this morning I was researching for Endgame, I'm finishing up right now, my new film.
[00:29:25.211 --> 00:29:35.116]  You know, I find these quotes by Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Advisor, co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, where he was supporting Pol Pot, killing millions.
[00:29:35.977 --> 00:29:39.479]  And I think, oh God, this is on Wikipedia, this could be wrong.
[00:29:40.188 --> 00:29:41.629]  This encyclopedia is wrong sometimes.
[00:29:41.649 --> 00:29:43.830]  I go, this can't be true.
[00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:44.770]  I mean, I know he's evil.
[00:29:45.991 --> 00:29:47.452]  But I go, this can't be true.
[00:29:47.492 --> 00:29:58.218]  And then I'm on an official website of his, one of the think tanks he writes for, where he actually found the entire audio of it, and the actual speech, where it was different from the quote I found.
[00:29:58.258 --> 00:29:59.859]  He was repeating it, and it was even worse.
[00:29:59.939 --> 00:30:01.580]  And I was just like, Jesus Christ.
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:07.883]  Because every major leader we've got, I've got them where they write books saying they're killing millions of innocent people's good.
[00:30:08.695 --> 00:30:12.978]  I can find quotes where they're saying, torture children, Republican, Democrat, it doesn't matter.
[00:30:13.658 --> 00:30:18.501]  I can find, uh, I can just, it's just, they're a pack of murdering killers.
[00:30:18.561 --> 00:30:19.962]  I mean, that's all I can tell you folks.
[00:30:20.002 --> 00:30:21.362]  They are so bloodthirsty.
[00:30:21.923 --> 00:30:23.824]  You haven't, I mean, they actually one up each other.
[00:30:23.844 --> 00:30:25.965]  They brag to each other about how ruthless they are.
[00:30:26.905 --> 00:30:30.668]  And then they start talking about how they want to get the American people and how they can't wait to get you.
[00:30:30.688 --> 00:30:34.590]  I just, and I see y'all running around like a bunch of children.
[00:30:36.005 --> 00:30:40.509]  I see these men when I'm at the pool or when I'm at the movies or when I'm at the mall or when I'm on the street.
[00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.753]  I see these men and they're real proud, they strut, they stick their chin up.
[00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:49.858]  You see their girlfriend or wife behind them just really getting into how manly their man is.
[00:30:49.918 --> 00:30:54.983]  And you'll see them just enjoy opening up their car and getting in it.
[00:30:55.383 --> 00:31:00.107]  You'll just see them loving life and feeling like they're a million dollars and nothing can stop them.
[00:31:00.127 --> 00:31:01.689]  And I'm not even saying any of that's bad.
[00:31:02.446 --> 00:31:11.248]  But I know that they're so haughty that if I was to talk to them and go, hey, there's a plan for world government, there's a plan to take your freedom, there's a plan to... I need you to rally to fight this.
[00:31:11.268 --> 00:31:14.168]  They're just like, ha ha ha, there ain't nothing can touch me!
[00:31:14.488 --> 00:31:15.468]  Everything's great!
[00:31:16.209 --> 00:31:20.029]  Just like Germans, just like Russians, just like the Chinese, just like everybody else.
[00:31:20.709 --> 00:31:23.210]  You've got to learn for yourself, don't you?
[00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.051]  You just, most of you don't know history and that's why you're doomed to repeat it.
[00:31:28.271 --> 00:31:29.071]  And I come across
[00:31:30.527 --> 00:31:33.888]  I come across Bush Claims Oversight Exemption 2.
[00:31:34.968 --> 00:31:40.010]  The White House says the President's own order on classified data does not apply to the Office of the Vice President.
[00:31:42.411 --> 00:31:44.151]  Now their own orders don't apply to them.
[00:31:46.912 --> 00:31:50.373]  And I got former Soviet dissident warns of EU dictatorship.
[00:31:50.413 --> 00:31:53.714]  I'll get into that later if I want, but let me cover this now and then we'll go to some of your calls.
[00:31:56.812 --> 00:31:59.254]  This is out of the Associated Press today.
[00:31:59.294 --> 00:32:00.656]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:32:01.056 --> 00:32:03.599]  Cameron's bag raises a few eyebrows.
[00:32:03.619 --> 00:32:05.601]  And yeah, I talked about this last week.
[00:32:06.481 --> 00:32:16.051]  When you walk up to me and you're wearing a communist star, frankly, just don't talk to me because I really have a compulsion to punch you in the nose.
[00:32:17.805 --> 00:32:18.305]  I mean, really!
[00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:19.426]  I mean, it's not a joke.
[00:32:19.446 --> 00:32:20.146]  I see you as a threat.
[00:32:20.526 --> 00:32:23.647]  Believe me, I've been out protesting skinheads before, folks.
[00:32:23.927 --> 00:32:27.369]  They've got big Nazi flags and Nazi armbands, and I want to punch them in the nose.
[00:32:27.989 --> 00:32:33.031]  Now, I don't do it, but most of them are feds, and I'd go to prison for punching a federal officer.
[00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:34.532]  That's why there's so many cops guarding them.
[00:32:34.592 --> 00:32:35.172]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[00:32:35.672 --> 00:32:41.014]  Just out in Orlando a few months ago, it turned out the whole rally was FBI people.
[00:32:41.034 --> 00:32:42.235]  It was just all states.
[00:32:42.255 --> 00:32:43.335]  Those groups aren't real.
[00:32:43.755 --> 00:32:45.196]  So yeah, that's why there's so much police protection.
[00:32:46.044 --> 00:32:47.825]  You've got to have your protest, you're not going to have that much.
[00:32:47.845 --> 00:32:49.266]  They've got to protect the Feds.
[00:32:49.686 --> 00:32:50.927]  They're creating the illusion of all this.
[00:32:50.947 --> 00:32:54.769]  But my point is that I feel violent towards it.
[00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:58.791]  Because folks, Hitler only caused the deaths of 22 million.
[00:32:58.811 --> 00:32:59.551]  That's terrible.
[00:33:01.172 --> 00:33:03.553]  But as Stalin said, when one man dies, it's a statistic.
[00:33:03.593 --> 00:33:06.515]  When a million die, it is a... or when one man dies, it's a...
[00:33:08.165 --> 00:33:10.547]  I always said, when one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:33:10.587 --> 00:33:12.168]  When 10,000 dies, it's a statistic.
[00:33:12.188 --> 00:33:14.249]  I actually was searching for the actual quote.
[00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:15.410]  It was in the Russian archives.
[00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:15.890]  It is.
[00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:16.530]  It was in a speech.
[00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.711]  I've said it many times.
[00:33:18.211 --> 00:33:18.832]  And on radio.
[00:33:19.152 --> 00:33:21.734]  It is, when one man dies, it is a tragedy.
[00:33:21.774 --> 00:33:23.215]  When a million dies, it's a statistic.
[00:33:25.596 --> 00:33:29.298]  They killed over 120 million people.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:36.803]  From Pol Pot, to Mao Zedong, to Vladimir Lenin, and
[00:33:38.038 --> 00:33:38.318]  All of them.
[00:33:38.978 --> 00:33:39.478]  Stalin.
[00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:42.179]  Mr. Steele.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:52.842]  And so you got this young Hollywood starlet, and she's out there, and she's out in Peru, and no doubt she did this on purpose.
[00:33:52.882 --> 00:33:56.522]  She probably wanted to think, she's probably scared going to those places she's visiting.
[00:33:56.542 --> 00:33:58.863]  She thinks, oh, Shining Path will like me.
[00:33:59.423 --> 00:34:04.444]  Shining Path would come into a village, and if you didn't convert, they would kill everyone, including newborn babies.
[00:34:05.225 --> 00:34:06.845]  They would cut babies out of women,
[00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.772]  They would do whatever they wanted for terror, and thank God they failed.
[00:34:12.814 --> 00:34:16.937]  Actress Cameron Diaz appears to have committed a major fashion crime in Peru.
[00:34:17.718 --> 00:34:24.583]  Oh, see, it's a cute little joke here from the Associated Press.
[00:34:25.324 --> 00:34:32.069]  The voice of Princess Fiona in the animated Shrek films may have inadvertently offended Peruvians.
[00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:32.910]  Well, how dare them?
[00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:36.293]  By the way, it wasn't the trendies coming up, it was the little peasants.
[00:34:37.338 --> 00:34:38.338]  Because they knew what it meant.
[00:34:38.378 --> 00:34:41.019]  What she had on there was the banners that the Shining Path used.
[00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:42.339]  They were scared.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.520]  They were freaking out.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.780]  It's real funny to the trendies.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.600]  Oh, look at them.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.381]  They're scared.
[00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:48.401]  They don't like me having something slaughtered.
[00:34:48.421 --> 00:34:50.222]  They're not cool.
[00:34:52.762 --> 00:35:02.545]  They suffered decades of violence from a malice guerrilla insurgency by touring there on Friday with a bag emblazoned with one of Mao Zedong's favorite political slogans.
[00:35:03.387 --> 00:35:07.771]  I wonder how those little Peruvian immigrants feel when they're up in Denver where they've got Mal's Restaurant, they've got one in London.
[00:35:08.111 --> 00:35:09.693]  All the trendies, you just can't keep them out.
[00:35:10.013 --> 00:35:13.756]  They love going to Mal's Restaurant and buying all the paraphernalia.
[00:35:14.877 --> 00:35:28.910]  While she explored the Inca city of Machu Picchu, high in the Peruvian Andes, Diaz wore over her shoulder an olive green messenger bag emblazoned with a red star and the words, serve the people.
[00:35:29.921 --> 00:35:32.603]  He sure served them when he killed at least 60 mil.
[00:35:33.103 --> 00:35:35.184]  Actual number of those 70 mil will be conservative.
[00:35:35.705 --> 00:35:43.029]  Serve the people printed in Chinese on the flat perhaps Chinese Communist leader Mao's most famous political slogan.
[00:35:43.049 --> 00:35:45.571]  In another article about it she said there's just something about Mao.
[00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:49.693]  Yeah, gibbering demon creatures like Mike Tyson like him too.
[00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:54.036]  Making 20-30 mil a fight and he's got Mao Zedong on his arm.
[00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:02.031]  I mean, to make up for the number he killed, you'd have to have three Hitlers on you.
[00:36:03.332 --> 00:36:13.060]  But again, the media doesn't ever tell you it's bad, because David Rockefeller and the globalists, they wrote books about it, helped fund Mao, that now admits that the CIA put Mao in over the Nationalists.
[00:36:14.681 --> 00:36:18.084]  And again, the people running America wanted the Khmer Rouge.
[00:36:18.485 --> 00:36:20.846]  The people running America now put Mao in.
[00:36:21.347 --> 00:36:25.030]  The people running America want to do that here.
[00:36:26.488 --> 00:36:28.549]  You understand that, Cameron Diaz?
[00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:39.377]  It says, the Maoist Shining Path insurgency took Peru to the edge of chaos in the 1980s and 90s in a campaign of massacres, assassinations and bombings, claiming the lives of 70,000 people!
[00:36:39.677 --> 00:36:42.339]  Yeah!
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.482]  So keep your Mao BS!
[00:36:47.542 --> 00:36:48.883]  Excuse me, I'm out of control today.
[00:36:49.203 --> 00:36:50.304]  KEEP IT TO YOURSELF!
[00:36:51.425 --> 00:36:53.226]  KEEP IT TO YOURSELF, YOU SCUM!
[00:36:54.046 --> 00:36:56.128]  And keep all the rest of your bull to yourself!
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.841]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[00:37:00.543 --> 00:37:03.285]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[00:37:03.645 --> 00:37:10.610]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.

[00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.931]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:03.231 --> 00:38:06.072]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:38:06.572 --> 00:38:08.773]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:38:09.394 --> 00:38:17.697]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:38:18.177 --> 00:38:18.717]  An example?
[00:38:19.258 --> 00:38:22.099]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:25.740]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:38:26.121 --> 00:38:29.382]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:35.343]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:38:35.983 --> 00:38:37.464]  Money is not the problem.
[00:38:37.684 --> 00:38:38.685]  Availability is.
[00:38:39.205 --> 00:38:41.046]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[00:38:41.306 --> 00:38:44.968]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:38:45.588 --> 00:38:47.689]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[00:38:47.769 --> 00:38:48.750]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:48.810]  800-409-5633.
[00:39:01.235 --> 00:39:09.599]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.

[00:39:37.248 --> 00:39:38.268]  Full color photograph.
[00:39:38.268 --> 00:39:38.708]  Hey Emily!
[00:39:38.728 --> 00:39:39.288]  Wow, you look great!
[00:40:03.783 --> 00:40:04.564]  I feel great.
[00:40:04.844 --> 00:40:06.705]  I've been using Medi-Cleanse Colin-Cleanse.
[00:40:07.125 --> 00:40:07.425]  Really?
[00:40:07.626 --> 00:40:08.066]  What is it?
[00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:08.666]  How does it work?
[00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:15.751]  Well, Medi-Cleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[00:40:16.071 --> 00:40:18.332]  Medi-Cleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:40:18.713 --> 00:40:23.836]  You take two tablespoons of Medi-Cleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:40:24.336 --> 00:40:24.817]  That's it?
[00:40:25.057 --> 00:40:26.638]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:40:26.959 --> 00:40:27.679]  It is easy.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:34.586]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:40:34.886 --> 00:40:36.227]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:40:36.407 --> 00:40:37.188]  That's amazing!
[00:40:37.528 --> 00:40:42.873]  And, the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:40:43.133 --> 00:40:43.434]  Wow!
[00:40:43.634 --> 00:40:44.695]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:40:45.135 --> 00:40:48.136]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:40:48.236 --> 00:40:52.118]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:40:52.338 --> 00:40:52.818]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[00:40:52.838 --> 00:40:53.078]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:40:53.098 --> 00:40:58.280]  News, politics, sports, cars, home improvement, health, and everything in between.
[00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:03.022]  We've got you covered.
[00:41:03.122 --> 00:41:05.563]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:12.051 --> 00:41:15.133]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:18.294]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show!
[00:41:21.796 --> 00:41:23.477]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[00:41:24.017 --> 00:41:26.118]  Here's an example of how the New World Order is all around us.
[00:41:27.559 --> 00:41:35.003]  In the KLVJ studios where I broadcast out of, they've got the television on with Gordon Brown, the new British Prime Minister, with Tony Blair leaving.
[00:41:35.703 --> 00:41:41.606]  Now I happen to have the skinny on Gordon Brown, he publicly gives speeches calling for world government, destruction of England's sovereignty, openly!
[00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:44.113]  He calls himself a conservative.
[00:41:44.133 --> 00:41:49.579]  He's about as conservative as... as Mao Zedong.
[00:41:51.181 --> 00:41:51.982]  It's just sick!
[00:41:52.903 --> 00:41:54.845]  And man, you talk about scary when this guy talks.
[00:41:54.865 --> 00:41:57.148]  He's got eyes that look like they're great white sharks.
[00:41:57.568 --> 00:41:58.470]  Completely dead.
[00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.392]  But it's the words that matter.
[00:42:01.463 --> 00:42:03.684]  And I just started thinking about what they're doing.
[00:42:03.724 --> 00:42:08.806]  I mean, here in the U.S., Dick Cheney and Bush have announced they're above the law, even their own federal laws, even their own executive orders.
[00:42:09.086 --> 00:42:11.407]  They're above all laws, including murder and torture.
[00:42:11.647 --> 00:42:12.987]  And that's in White House memos now.
[00:42:13.668 --> 00:42:15.308]  And it's just, this is ABC News.
[00:42:15.648 --> 00:42:16.669]  Cheney power grabs us.
[00:42:16.689 --> 00:42:17.989]  White House rules don't apply to him.
[00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:20.270]  Let me pull up some more for you.
[00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:25.932]  Cheney declares VP, not part of executive branch, autonomous from entire government and all laws.
[00:42:26.352 --> 00:42:28.293]  I mean, folks, we are in trouble.
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.161]  Here's an editorial about it.
[00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:33.722]  Cheney exempts himself from reality.
[00:42:34.082 --> 00:42:47.370]  But again, Dick Cheney is nothing but a complete puppet who runs the now offshore corporation, Halliburton, that has a move to Dubai, Pakistan, but will still get all the no-bid contracts on the ongoing war that, by the way, is going exactly as the Pentagon planned.
[00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:51.553]  Expand it, stay there, have chaos, exterminate the population.
[00:42:51.813 --> 00:42:53.094]  That's an official U.S.
[00:42:53.154 --> 00:42:54.915]  and Israeli document, but of course you won't read them.
[00:42:55.315 --> 00:42:58.497]  You'll just make the decision to claim that it's not true what I just said.
[00:42:59.614 --> 00:43:04.858]  The people running the US, the people running England, are working to destroy them.
[00:43:05.158 --> 00:43:07.460]  Do you understand that?
[00:43:08.981 --> 00:43:21.049]  I have all the mainstream articles right here in front of me, where Tony Blair, the last thing he did, leaving office last week, was to sign an executive order, which again has no force of law over the Parliament,
[00:43:21.866 --> 00:43:41.652]  Claiming that something Europe got to vote on two years ago, and the Europeans said, no, we don't want to lose all of our local courts, we don't want to lose our Bill of Rights, under the EU Constitution, a tax on free speech, private property, all these things, it's billed as a, but by the time it's on our media, it is billed as a human rights law.
[00:43:41.672 --> 00:43:49.455]  Oh, Tony Blair just wants human rights, a new law, and then you read it, and it puts England under the EU super courts.
[00:43:52.179 --> 00:43:58.004]  In fact, let me just go to PrisonPlanet.com because I have a bunch of articles I meant to print off and they're not here in the stack.
[00:43:58.484 --> 00:44:04.589]  But if you go down to the globalization section on the site, we have all the headlines.
[00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:08.953]  Treaty hands swaths of power to Brussels.
[00:44:08.993 --> 00:44:10.974]  That's the capital of the EU.
[00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:12.476]  Here's another one.
[00:44:12.516 --> 00:44:16.459]  Blair hands power to EU time bomb as treaty starts to unravel.
[00:44:16.699 --> 00:44:18.901]  Now they always say that to fool you so it can pass.
[00:44:19.953 --> 00:44:21.975]  Over 90% in major polls.
[00:44:22.015 --> 00:44:24.797]  It was 80+, but when they did the secret deal, new polls just came out.
[00:44:25.158 --> 00:44:27.159]  Over 90% of the British people are against this.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.560]  What's the government do?
[00:44:28.841 --> 00:44:38.629]  Both major parties, both the conservative Tories and Labour, have circled the wagon and are announcing, sorry, that's the way it is, we're doing it.
[00:44:40.583 --> 00:44:45.368]  We're handing over total control of the EU to the EU of our government.
[00:44:45.568 --> 00:44:49.632]  And there he is, that traitor, right now on the television set, Gordon Brown.
[00:44:49.652 --> 00:44:50.873]  What a piece of filth!
[00:44:53.536 --> 00:44:55.037]  Oh man, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:44:55.077 --> 00:44:56.659]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[00:44:58.115 --> 00:45:02.137]  Coming up, I'm going to get into viruses that are in vaccines that attack your brain.
[00:45:02.638 --> 00:45:04.139]  But they tell you they're good for you.
[00:45:04.859 --> 00:45:07.120]  The good news is the people are waking up that the government is corrupt.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.842]  Also, Michael Moore, 9-11 could be an inside job.
[00:45:09.862 --> 00:45:13.244]  Of course, on the heels of it, he's putting out a movie about how socialized health care is good.
[00:45:13.264 --> 00:45:16.165]  So, it's Michael Moore or something else, man.
[00:45:18.647 --> 00:45:19.167]  We'll get into that.
[00:45:19.207 --> 00:45:22.189]  Oh, by the way, the EU earlier this week, this is mainstream news.
[00:45:22.927 --> 00:45:28.631]  It's sad that if you say the EU is bad and you resist it politically, you're on a terrorist list.
[00:45:29.172 --> 00:45:30.853]  Folks, you can't make this type of stuff up.
[00:45:30.893 --> 00:45:32.154]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[00:45:32.234 --> 00:45:33.455]  It's just incredible!
[00:45:34.075 --> 00:45:35.876]  Do you know what's in the Patriot Act?
[00:45:36.017 --> 00:45:36.517]  I've read it.
[00:45:36.837 --> 00:45:37.778]  Man, it's scary.
[00:45:38.058 --> 00:45:40.099]  Do you know what's in the Military Commissions Act?
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:44.363]  Do you know what is in the Enemy Combatant Act?
[00:45:44.423 --> 00:45:45.023]  Do you know?
[00:45:45.083 --> 00:45:45.844]  Well, I do.
[00:45:46.524 --> 00:45:48.065]  And I read what Cheney just said.
[00:45:49.486 --> 00:45:51.808]  Cheney now claims that if he just writes something, it's law.
[00:45:54.591 --> 00:45:59.455]  Folks, this is the same thing as saying that they can kill people on the White House lawn and barbecue people.
[00:45:59.796 --> 00:46:00.817]  I mean, hell, they might as well.
[00:46:00.837 --> 00:46:02.778]  They've said worse things in the memos.
[00:46:03.479 --> 00:46:04.480]  They can torture children.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:11.406]  I mean, we're living in the Twilight Zone, but you're wedded to them because, well, I'm a conservative and they're better than Hillary.
[00:46:12.507 --> 00:46:13.668]  Don't you understand?
[00:46:13.688 --> 00:46:15.249]  Do you like being gamed and fooled?
[00:46:16.951 --> 00:46:20.434]  Don't you understand that they're running a bunch of dead horse candidates?
[00:46:21.374 --> 00:46:25.196]  I mean, Giuliani is more liberal in many cases than even Hillary.
[00:46:26.057 --> 00:46:27.397]  And more pro-war, so you like him.
[00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:31.680]  Giuliani, the penguin, the son of a known capo mob boss.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.641]  I mean, this is what a joke we've become.
[00:46:35.782 --> 00:46:36.763]  You're like, I don't believe that.
[00:46:36.983 --> 00:46:37.723]  Go look it up!
[00:46:37.783 --> 00:46:39.084]  It's mainstream news!
[00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:41.465]  I didn't even know that until a few months ago, though.
[00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:43.106]  I thought, well, nobody had mob connections.
[00:46:43.346 --> 00:46:45.207]  And then I went and read, my God!
[00:46:45.587 --> 00:46:48.549]  Mainstream books and newspaper articles.
[00:46:48.609 --> 00:46:50.150]  He's a, he, oh my God.
[00:46:52.006 --> 00:46:56.073]  My point is that he will lose the Republican nomination.
[00:46:56.594 --> 00:47:01.262]  If Giuliani was to win the Republican nomination, he would lose hands down against Democrats.
[00:47:02.344 --> 00:47:02.845]  No problem.
[00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:04.368]  And then you're going to get Hillary.
[00:47:05.188 --> 00:47:05.989]  You're going to get Hillary.
[00:47:06.509 --> 00:47:07.771]  Only Ron Paul can beat Hillary.
[00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:10.974]  Then Las Vegas, a month after I've been reporting that, did the odds.
[00:47:11.314 --> 00:47:15.979]  One of the biggest booking odds agencies.
[00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.520]  The big one that does all the NFL stuff.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.561]  It's pretty exact.
[00:47:18.601 --> 00:47:19.462]  It's NFL something.
[00:47:19.882 --> 00:47:24.387]  They and several others did the analysis and they said Ron Paul is the only one that can beat Hillary.
[00:47:25.348 --> 00:47:26.529]  And they took him from 200-1 to 15-1 and now he's only 5-1.
[00:47:30.325 --> 00:47:33.067]  See, they're saying to win the Republican nomination.
[00:47:33.307 --> 00:47:35.708]  But if he was to win it, he could beat Hillary.
[00:47:36.149 --> 00:47:37.749]  And I'm not going to go through the whole breakdown and why.
[00:47:37.769 --> 00:47:38.570]  I've done that before.
[00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:39.731]  Most of you know why.
[00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:42.312]  That's why they're not giving him the attention.
[00:47:42.332 --> 00:47:47.455]  That's why the Republican Party in Iowa is blocking him from that televised forum that they're going to have.
[00:47:47.475 --> 00:47:48.956]  There's going to be a giant demonstration there.
[00:47:48.976 --> 00:47:50.337]  They're not going to distract from Ron Paul.
[00:47:50.677 --> 00:47:52.158]  He's going to be out front talking to the cameras.
[00:47:52.987 --> 00:48:05.990]  Turns out the head of the Iowa group that's blocking Ron Paul from the next forum, they're not calling it a debate, it's a televised forum, a discussion, it is a debate, is one of John McCain's top campaign managers.
[00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.911]  He's the manager in that state, but also on his board.
[00:48:11.412 --> 00:48:14.172]  And of course, John McCain's not meant to win.
[00:48:14.212 --> 00:48:15.613]  He's a ringer too, folks.
[00:48:15.853 --> 00:48:20.594]  They're running a bunch of old, broke-back horses against that demon-eyed thoroughbred Hillary.
[00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:30.022]  While Fox Television and News Corp and Roger Ailes are advising her, and Rupert Murdoch has dinner with her each week for the last four years, they are behind her.
[00:48:30.402 --> 00:48:34.546]  They got the nerve to have Sean Hannity up there claiming his show's about defeating Hillary.
[00:48:34.906 --> 00:48:35.387]  Bull!
[00:48:36.027 --> 00:48:41.552]  It's about keeping you in your place and making sure it's conservative if you don't actually wake up until it's too late.
[00:48:42.113 --> 00:48:43.794]  You ever heard of camouflage in the military?
[00:48:44.015 --> 00:48:47.678]  You ever heard of enemy forces dressing up in your own uniform?
[00:48:48.473 --> 00:48:55.976]  All these neocon talk show hosts, they dress up in conservative uniforms and they walk right up to you and when you turn your back they stick that stiletto right in your neck.
[00:48:56.196 --> 00:49:01.418]  And you're like, oh thank you Hannity, thank you Wiener Savage, thank you all of you.
[00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:05.579]  Oh, oh thank you for being traitors to the republic.
[00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:07.580]  Oh, oh it's so sweet of you.
[00:49:08.871 --> 00:49:09.912]  You just love losing.
[00:49:09.932 --> 00:49:10.933]  You love being conned.
[00:49:10.953 --> 00:49:12.093]  You love being gamed.
[00:49:12.514 --> 00:49:14.575]  See, I won't sit here and tell you, you're a great American.
[00:49:14.735 --> 00:49:15.496]  You're a great American.
[00:49:15.816 --> 00:49:16.917]  Oh, we're great Americans.
[00:49:17.277 --> 00:49:18.258]  Oh, America's great.
[00:49:18.618 --> 00:49:19.439]  Oh, everything's fine.
[00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:20.660]  Oh, we're the good guys.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.461]  Oh, we're the da-da-da-da-da.
[00:49:22.761 --> 00:49:24.102]  No, man, we're decadent.
[00:49:24.123 --> 00:49:24.623]  We're evil.
[00:49:24.803 --> 00:49:25.403]  We're in trouble.
[00:49:25.444 --> 00:49:31.328]  We've been overrun by foreign corporations that are literally looting us and selling us out and acting like the ship's gonna sink.
[00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:33.950]  I mean, folks, if five years ago you thought corporate
[00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:39.111]  Moves overseas, and you thought the brain drain was bad in the U.S.
[00:49:39.631 --> 00:49:41.312]  For the first time in history that people are leaving here.
[00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:45.633]  And the elite buying private islands was bad, and escaping.
[00:49:46.073 --> 00:49:48.794]  That was like they'd taken the couches and maybe the bookshelves out.
[00:49:49.014 --> 00:49:50.374]  They're ripping the wallpaper out.
[00:49:50.394 --> 00:49:51.554]  They're taking out the chandeliers.
[00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:53.735]  They're ripping the sinks out of the country right now.
[00:49:55.316 --> 00:49:57.156]  I mean, they're pulling up the flooring, man.
[00:49:57.236 --> 00:49:58.436]  Running out the back door with it.
[00:49:58.676 --> 00:50:00.437]  Hell, they're even pulling the walls out now.
[00:50:02.037 --> 00:50:09.001]  While wrapping themselves in American flags on the news going, America, oh yeah, fighting for your freedom!
[00:50:09.481 --> 00:50:14.123]  They just flap an American flag in front of you like a zombie, you go, oh, America, patriotic!
[00:50:14.624 --> 00:50:26.129]  It's this very Republican Party with the Democrats, in league, right now, for total amnesty, of convicted, aggravated felons, they get tax exemption, no taxes for five years, that's in the bill!
[00:50:30.172 --> 00:50:30.852]  That's in there!
[00:50:33.001 --> 00:50:39.363]  But you're like America, and you got your big ol' truck with big ol' tires and rebel flags and support the troop flags everywhere.
[00:50:39.583 --> 00:50:41.484]  You're driving around, had a few liquors.
[00:50:42.484 --> 00:50:47.346]  Oh yeah, you're feeling real good right now, boy.
[00:50:47.726 --> 00:50:50.607]  America's doing so good for you.
[00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:53.148]  Everything's gonna be alright.
[00:50:53.648 --> 00:50:56.189]  You're a country, and you love America.
[00:50:56.209 --> 00:50:59.010]  I mean, that's the spirit of it.
[00:50:59.594 --> 00:51:00.874]  And I'm going, no, no, they've taken over!
[00:51:00.894 --> 00:51:01.835]  They're destroying the nation!
[00:51:01.955 --> 00:51:02.975]  They're lowering our defenses!
[00:51:02.995 --> 00:51:04.115]  They're totally selling us out!
[00:51:04.315 --> 00:51:06.296]  Mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday!
[00:51:06.656 --> 00:51:09.197]  You're just listening to that hardcore commie over there.
[00:51:09.217 --> 00:51:14.818]  And I'm like, no, actually, our own government funded the Soviets and funded the Maoists and funded them all.
[00:51:15.099 --> 00:51:16.359]  Here, here, they wrote books about it!
[00:51:16.499 --> 00:51:17.699]  Here, the people that did it admit it!
[00:51:17.879 --> 00:51:20.840]  Here, here's History Channel with the head of the CIA admitting they put Mao in.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.221]  Shut up, commie!
[00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:25.642]  But no, I'm against the communists!
[00:51:25.702 --> 00:51:26.762]  I bet you are, commie.
[00:51:27.765 --> 00:51:28.986]  I just like Newt Gingrich.
[00:51:29.026 --> 00:51:32.628]  He says we should ban First Amendment and shut you up right now!
[00:51:33.028 --> 00:51:35.389]  And Trent Lott says shut down talk radio!
[00:51:35.409 --> 00:51:37.330]  I kinda like Hillary now!
[00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:41.853]  I like to be conservative!
[00:51:42.293 --> 00:51:43.634]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:51:43.654 --> 00:51:45.675]  We will come back and go right to your calls, I promise.
[00:51:46.035 --> 00:51:49.177]  And then we've got the new loving vaccines that attack your brain!
[00:51:50.966 --> 00:51:52.006]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:52.106 --> 00:51:56.927]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[00:51:57.028 --> 00:51:59.928]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[00:52:00.068 --> 00:52:04.069]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[00:52:04.389 --> 00:52:10.391]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[00:52:10.571 --> 00:52:11.811]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:11.851 --> 00:52:13.231]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:21.841 --> 00:52:24.343]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:52:24.803 --> 00:52:26.704]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:27.424 --> 00:52:30.586]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:31.247 --> 00:52:37.710]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:52:38.491 --> 00:52:40.692]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:52:41.072 --> 00:52:41.513]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:41.593 --> 00:52:42.994]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:51.521 --> 00:53:01.026]  Let's do it.
[00:53:02.047 --> 00:53:03.387]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:04.808 --> 00:53:06.629]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:09.571]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:10.051 --> 00:53:12.812]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:13.753 --> 00:53:15.574]  Call Alex now, toll free.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:16.801]  At 877-590-5525.
[00:53:16.861 --> 00:53:20.769]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:31.931]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:53:32.052 --> 00:53:33.212]  It is July 1st, 2007.
[00:53:33.332 --> 00:53:37.534]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours, roughly.
[00:53:37.994 --> 00:53:50.399]  We're going to have open phones as well at 877-590-5525, or if you're listening to where this broadcast originates from, off our mothership home station, KLBJ-590, 8360-590.
[00:53:50.539 --> 00:53:57.422]  I want to thank all the AM and FM affiliates that do pick up the show.
[00:53:58.257 --> 00:54:00.118]  New station's turning us on every few weeks.
[00:54:00.238 --> 00:54:03.880]  In fact, quite a few inquiries just this week about picking up the show.
[00:54:05.481 --> 00:54:09.043]  As it grows, been doing it now for about, what, six months syndicated.
[00:54:09.063 --> 00:54:14.586]  Been in here almost a year total now doing this Sunday radio show from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:54:15.006 --> 00:54:17.688]  Central Standard Time, I guess five days a week.
[00:54:18.148 --> 00:54:20.089]  Been in a syndicated radio show since 1998.
[00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:22.491]  Is not enough for me.
[00:54:22.571 --> 00:54:23.051]  Weekdays.
[00:54:23.673 --> 00:54:29.336]  I am here on Sundays because so much happens over the weekend, and it is a news broadcast.
[00:54:29.376 --> 00:54:39.142]  It is a broadcast dedicated to exposing corruption and the powerful globalist forces attempting to really end the United States as we know it.
[00:54:39.622 --> 00:54:40.943]  And it's not just here in the U.S.
[00:54:40.983 --> 00:54:43.785]  They are setting up tyranny all over the planet.
[00:54:45.045 --> 00:54:47.747]  So again, thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:54:47.787 --> 00:54:51.129]  We will be going to your calls a little bit later in this hour.
[00:54:51.289 --> 00:54:52.730]  Obviously, we'll be talking about
[00:54:53.385 --> 00:54:55.766]  The new terror threat in the United Kingdom.
[00:54:56.727 --> 00:55:03.770]  We've got two failed firebombings, is how they could properly be termed.
[00:55:03.791 --> 00:55:08.473]  I don't want to give the scaremonger media, who's calling it a fiery holocaust, the proper term.
[00:55:08.493 --> 00:55:14.996]  They'd really love to fearmonger with that, but I guess the boys at the CIA haven't figured out yet that they can call this firebombings.
[00:55:15.857 --> 00:55:21.780]  But two failed firebombings, thanks to the bravery of the constabulary
[00:55:22.607 --> 00:55:30.111]  In and around London, and of course one successful attack, clearly an attack, up in Glasgow, Scotland, on an airport.
[00:55:30.591 --> 00:55:36.414]  We'll be going over that today, what's being termed as a fiery holocaust.
[00:55:36.714 --> 00:55:44.538]  No one died, but Fox News in particular, you would think that the sun had exploded and the earth was destroyed yesterday.
[00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:52.952]  But nevertheless, an image of a burning car certainly will get a lot of gas mileage towards butchering what's left of British national sovereignty.
[00:55:53.352 --> 00:55:58.253]  And we'll go into what's really behind all of this and the past history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:55:58.273 --> 00:56:08.396]  I think I will surprise some people by telling you that just looking at this, studying this the last two days, I tend to think this is actually real terrorism.
[00:56:09.396 --> 00:56:12.937]  I have to say that right now, this is prompt.
[00:56:12.957 --> 00:56:14.277]  Now again, we're not sure about that.
[00:56:15.906 --> 00:56:18.487]  But I'd have to say I'm more than fifty percent sure.
[00:56:19.487 --> 00:56:25.388]  I'm leaning towards this being a real homegrown Muslim terrorist.
[00:56:26.848 --> 00:56:30.509]  But we will go over that today and discuss it.
[00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:35.270]  There is no doubt though that the government of the U.S.
[00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:42.851]  and the government of England, that is the private corporations owned by private banks that call themselves the government, are engaging in mass terror
[00:56:43.793 --> 00:56:52.317]  That is terrorizing the public into basically convulsing in fear and begging to have their liberties and freedoms taken.
[00:56:53.037 --> 00:56:59.380]  So we'll break down the real definition of terrorism and who is really engaging in classical fear-mongering.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:09.865]  We'll be going over that because we have international statistics and federal statistics and depending on which ones you look at, you're between 300
[00:57:11.562 --> 00:57:23.067]  And fifty and six hundred times more likely to die in an automobile accident, depending on which country you live in, here in the US it's over four hundred, than to die by terrorist.
[00:57:23.747 --> 00:57:26.268]  You are over two hundred times more likely to die by grounding.
[00:57:26.989 --> 00:57:28.449]  These are unnatural forms of death.
[00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:33.071]  But it doesn't matter, we don't see everyone running around hyperventilating in fear.
[00:57:33.091 --> 00:57:37.033]  I was driving around the governor's mansion Friday night
[00:57:38.344 --> 00:57:51.430]  Getting video shots for a film I'm making about, well, a section of the film, a few minutes, is about Perry going to Bilderberg a few weeks ago, criminally, violating the Logan Act, federal law, going to an international meeting to set policy with private interests.
[00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:57.332]  That is illegal unless you have a presidential, state, department, or congressional letter of authorization to do so.
[00:57:58.113 --> 00:57:59.733]  And I'm just driving around twice.
[00:57:59.753 --> 00:58:02.815]  We're in a red Mustang convertible that one of my employees has.
[00:58:03.275 --> 00:58:04.575]  We're videotaping out the back.
[00:58:04.615 --> 00:58:05.676]  It's clear as day what we're doing.
[00:58:06.323 --> 00:58:08.685]  State police run out into the middle of the road.
[00:58:09.206 --> 00:58:13.609]  Thank God we saw this guy because I could see it.
[00:58:13.669 --> 00:58:18.253]  It had been on the news we were Al-Qaeda trying to... Who knew Alex Jones was Al-Qaeda?
[00:58:18.794 --> 00:58:20.695]  And trying to fight our valiant state police.
[00:58:20.715 --> 00:58:22.777]  But the guy ran out in the middle of the street in front of us.
[00:58:22.817 --> 00:58:23.357]  We stopped.
[00:58:24.198 --> 00:58:26.020]  And then he asked for our papers.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:26.720]  We showed it to him.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.621]  But of course it was due to the...
[00:58:30.487 --> 00:58:36.411]  Oh, Alex Jones, and then some Austin cops rushed up and they didn't even say anything to us, they just laughed and got back and drove off.
[00:58:36.531 --> 00:58:38.832]  The heightened security!
[00:58:38.892 --> 00:58:41.234]  Deadly, deadly Al-Qaeda!
[00:58:42.615 --> 00:58:45.276]  But we will go over that for you.
[00:58:46.197 --> 00:58:51.440]  It's much more cinematic to get some rolling shots of the Governor's Mansion and then roll past with the Capitol in the background.
[00:58:52.221 --> 00:58:57.664]  And that, again, they must have thought our Sony video cameras were plutonium beams or
[00:58:58.399 --> 00:58:58.839]  Who knows?
[00:58:58.879 --> 00:59:00.260]  Maybe kryptonite cannons.
[00:59:01.861 --> 00:59:02.281]  I don't know.
[00:59:03.262 --> 00:59:07.485]  Some type of super laser weapon or something.
[00:59:07.525 --> 00:59:08.845]  You should be worried about the border.
[00:59:09.226 --> 00:59:13.648]  Only two miles of border fence has been built.
[00:59:14.129 --> 00:59:16.670]  Get up on TV and claim they built thousands of miles of it.
[00:59:17.531 --> 00:59:18.812]  You ought to really worry about that.
[00:59:18.872 --> 00:59:19.952]  Or the open northern border.
[00:59:20.012 --> 00:59:21.833]  Really worried about all these terrorists.
[00:59:21.853 --> 00:59:23.054]  But again, they're not really worried.
[00:59:23.074 --> 00:59:26.556]  They just use that to fear-monger the police into setting up a police state.
[00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:27.617]  Oh, the cops are afraid!
[00:59:28.386 --> 00:59:30.908]  But again, that's all part of the brainwashing.
[00:59:30.968 --> 00:59:32.829]  So we'll go over that.
[00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:34.930]  Also, in the second hour, I want to get into chemtrails.
[00:59:36.972 --> 00:59:43.135]  NBC News did a report on chemtrails over California, and the broadcast basically said they were real.
[00:59:44.256 --> 00:59:45.957]  This is a very delicate subject.
[00:59:45.977 --> 00:59:55.303]  You've got a lot of schizophrenics, a lot of crazy people, who think that the moon is following them and the sun is following them.
[00:59:56.289 --> 01:00:03.794]  And that there are leprechauns basically in their clothes hamper in the bathroom, you know, with red glowing eyes at 3 a.m.
[01:00:03.814 --> 01:00:07.456]  trying to eat them by way of their feet sticking out from under the covers.
[01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:14.940]  We've got people who think that any condensation trail is a nerve gas affluent to kill everyone.
[01:00:16.461 --> 01:00:22.325]  So they give everybody a bad name that actually looks at the fact of until the mid-1990s, jet trails didn't form
[01:00:23.138 --> 01:00:24.599]  Any lower than 20,000 feet.
[01:00:24.679 --> 01:00:27.642]  They did it normally in the winter, and they were only up there for a few minutes.
[01:00:27.902 --> 01:00:29.623]  I have seen trails at 5,000 feet.
[01:00:30.284 --> 01:00:32.025]  I have seen trails that are there four hours later.
[01:00:32.386 --> 01:00:43.935]  I've seen them form cloud banks, and something's going on with the atmosphere, and now the Pentagon, the federal government, and even government textbooks admit they've got some program, secret program going on, altering our climate.
[01:00:44.796 --> 01:00:50.581]  And we've got one of these government climatologists on tape basically admitting this, and
[01:00:51.638 --> 01:00:59.362]  I talked to the father of weather weapons, Ben Livingston, last year, after we talked to him at broken papers around the country, including the Associated Press.
[01:01:00.094 --> 01:01:02.696]  That they just declassified so he was willing to talk about it at that time.
[01:01:02.736 --> 01:01:06.319]  No one paid attention to the fact that it had been declassified until he went public about it.
[01:01:06.699 --> 01:01:11.824]  About whether weapons that are being employed around the world, the question is are they being employed here?
[01:01:12.144 --> 01:01:18.469]  So I'm going to probably spend a segment on that and play a five minute clip from NBC for purposes of comment so we can analyze that.
[01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:23.293]  That is coming up in the latter half of the next hour.
[01:01:24.554 --> 01:01:26.896]  I will spend some time on that
[01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:33.193]  Also, in the next hour, I want to get into famous quotes of the New World Order.
[01:01:33.234 --> 01:01:39.197]  Now, there are so many thousands of these, but I'm only going to read 10 or 15, depending on time allows.
[01:01:39.718 --> 01:01:52.306]  These are from published works of some of the most powerful people in the world, saying that they're setting up a world government, saying that they want to take your liberties and freedoms, and saying they'll use terrorism to get it done.
[01:01:53.787 --> 01:01:55.548]  So this is pretty darn important.
[01:01:56.557 --> 01:02:02.078]  And we will go over this coming up in the next hour.
[01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:07.780]  I do want to break and then come back and get into the Scotland and London Terror Alert.
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:14.522]  What, just a month ago the Fed said it looked for airports to be bombed, truck bombs, car bombs in the U.S.
[01:02:14.822 --> 01:02:19.783]  Then they busted some non-Al Qaeda affiliated group that wanted to blow up JFK.
[01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:21.583]  Turned out that was a fraud.
[01:02:22.204 --> 01:02:23.384]  But we'll go over it.
[01:02:25.154 --> 01:02:33.159]  And then we will get into the attacks on free speech here in the country, on talk radio, cameras on street corners, everything.
[01:02:34.059 --> 01:02:36.560]  Big show, lined up for you, a lot of important information.
[01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:40.643]  With this Fourth of July coming up in just three days, we need to remember what made this country great.
[01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.124]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[01:02:43.144 --> 01:02:43.884]  Stay with us.
[01:02:55.265 --> 01:02:55.745]  It's here!
[01:02:55.945 --> 01:03:00.706]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:01.086 --> 01:03:08.748]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.408 --> 01:03:16.469]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:23.751]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:03:24.255 --> 01:03:28.258]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:28.599 --> 01:03:32.121]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:32.562 --> 01:03:34.463]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:34.824 --> 01:03:38.727]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:01.749 --> 01:05:03.870]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:14.814]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body, with more than 500 vital functions.

[01:05:55.865 --> 01:05:57.669]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:05:58.169 --> 01:05:59.953]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[01:06:00.253 --> 01:06:03.399]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:06:03.419 --> 01:06:05.463]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[01:06:08.817 --> 01:06:13.260]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.122]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[01:06:16.762 --> 01:06:25.228]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:06:25.768 --> 01:06:28.490]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:31.913]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[01:06:32.433 --> 01:06:36.896]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark.

[01:06:50.641 --> 01:06:54.523]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:09.194]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show!
[01:07:15.859 --> 01:07:16.519]  Welcome back.
[01:07:16.579 --> 01:07:19.462]  It is July 1st, 2007.
[01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:23.545]  We're live here on this Sunday edition.
[01:07:25.746 --> 01:07:26.127]  Okay.
[01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:35.534]  Now, I may be wrong about this, but I'm going to give the government the benefit of the doubt.
[01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:40.772]  And by that, there's different layers of government.
[01:07:41.192 --> 01:07:44.734]  But I'm going to give the government the benefit of the doubt.
[01:07:46.515 --> 01:07:56.641]  And say, okay, these are real Muslim terrorists that are attempting to set off, basically, firebombs.
[01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:05.827]  Petrol bombs, gasoline-laden Mercedes and Jeep Cherokees.
[01:08:07.668 --> 01:08:17.311]  Two failed events, of course, on Friday in London, down at Piccadilly Circus, where I have stayed when I've been visiting England.
[01:08:17.851 --> 01:08:18.391]  Know it well.
[01:08:19.831 --> 01:08:22.612]  And, of course, up at the airport in Glasgow, Scotland.
[01:08:24.853 --> 01:08:25.653]  But we know this.
[01:08:25.873 --> 01:08:31.955]  The response that we've seen, the unbelievable hand-wringing, I mean, they've called it a
[01:08:32.722 --> 01:08:37.266]  Fiery apocalypse, thick black plumes of death.
[01:08:37.306 --> 01:08:40.949]  Why, the death toll could have been in the thousands.
[01:08:41.049 --> 01:08:42.510]  It's the end of freedom.
[01:08:43.337 --> 01:08:47.500]  We've got to have secret arrest and secret imprisonment and a new war on terror.
[01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:50.843]  This could change society forever.
[01:08:50.963 --> 01:08:52.544]  It's unbelievable!
[01:08:52.905 --> 01:08:58.849]  My God, no one's died, but there could be hundreds of new truck bomb and car bomb attacks.
[01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:08.517]  The reporters are freaking out on air, saying they're having flashbacks of Baghdad and explosives going off at the markets.
[01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.619]  I mean, it is clear that the media,
[01:09:11.337 --> 01:09:18.319]  He is trying to scare the daylights, the living daylights, out of everyone who was watching television.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:23.281]  Now, Gordon Brown is a total New World Order globalist.
[01:09:24.701 --> 01:09:31.703]  Gordon Brown just came in as the new Prime Minister two days before these attacks took place, started on Friday.
[01:09:32.704 --> 01:09:39.786]  There was already talk of no confidence votes in the Parliament, and Gordon Brown could be out of office in just a few months if he didn't reverse
[01:09:40.521 --> 01:09:46.350]  uh... the occupation of iraq in the unpopular war coming up on five years here in just a few months
[01:09:48.527 --> 01:09:52.388]  And then magically, right on time, he said, look, terrorists are going to strike us.
[01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:53.889]  They're going to hit any minute.
[01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:58.931]  You haven't given me the new secret arrest, secret imprisonment powers I want.
[01:09:59.011 --> 01:10:02.252]  I have the BBC transcript here in front of me from just Wednesday.
[01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:04.773]  If you don't do this, the terrorists will strike.
[01:10:04.793 --> 01:10:05.813]  And the people said, no.
[01:10:06.153 --> 01:10:10.355]  We're tired of the millions of cameras, the checkpoints, the loss of liberty in this country.
[01:10:10.935 --> 01:10:12.075]  No, Gordon Brown.
[01:10:13.356 --> 01:10:14.296]  And boom!
[01:10:15.225 --> 01:10:24.067]  Why, the terrorists attack, and they attack Glasgow because that's where Gordon Brown's from, and they're testing him.
[01:10:24.107 --> 01:10:28.468]  The terrorists want to see if the British will now run like cowards.
[01:10:29.088 --> 01:10:35.169]  They want to see if the Scots will run like cowards after the evil Muslim terrorists struck.
[01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:43.611]  Will they give the terrorists what they want, or will they show that incredible British stiff upper lip we've always seen, and have courage?
[01:10:47.705 --> 01:10:53.408]  It's like clockwork, and they get to bring out all the images of the 7-7 bombings again two years ago.
[01:10:53.428 --> 01:10:55.208]  You know, I went there right after the first bombings.
[01:10:55.629 --> 01:10:58.650]  Then they had the next stage bombings right after I left.
[01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:07.234]  And we've proven in my film Terror Storm, about 30 minutes of the two-hour film is on the London bombings, that it was a government attack.
[01:11:07.934 --> 01:11:08.895]  Absolute proof.
[01:11:08.915 --> 01:11:16.118]  You can watch Terror Storm for free on Google Video, or if you want to just Google Terror Storm, or you want to get a high-quality DVD,
[01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.540]  And support me, the filmmaker.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.402]  I spent $100,000 making that film.
[01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:24.906]  I haven't made the money back yet, but my accountant says I might in the next three or four months.
[01:11:25.847 --> 01:11:31.631]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a 15-cent a day membership and watch it in super high quality, a lot better than Google Video.
[01:11:32.192 --> 01:11:36.375]  They're at PrisonPlanet.tv or go to InfoWars.com or Amazon.com and order a copy.
[01:11:36.716 --> 01:11:38.577]  They're off the site, the high quality DVD.
[01:11:39.999 --> 01:11:42.461]  But, again, just for free, Google Video, if you'd like.
[01:11:42.721 --> 01:11:43.802]  I put it out for free because
[01:11:44.505 --> 01:11:47.847]  Folks, we just want people to find out that the government's staging terror.
[01:11:48.727 --> 01:11:52.089]  Now people may say, well then why are you saying that this isn't staged terror?
[01:11:56.471 --> 01:12:01.294]  Hundreds of different points go into this analysis, and again, I may be wrong.
[01:12:01.894 --> 01:12:07.817]  Many times I've given the government the benefit of the doubt, because we know that there are real Muslim terrorists.
[01:12:07.877 --> 01:12:10.519]  There are real Muslims out there,
[01:12:11.599 --> 01:12:16.161]  Who do go on an Israeli bus in Tel Aviv and stab 14 people.
[01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.042]  There are real suicide bombers.
[01:12:19.623 --> 01:12:24.585]  There are real combatants that do go and engage in asymmetrical warfare.
[01:12:25.005 --> 01:12:25.605]  That's really what it is.
[01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:27.646]  It's warfare against civilian targets.
[01:12:27.666 --> 01:12:29.027]  And if you don't think Israel and the U.S.
[01:12:29.087 --> 01:12:31.668]  and England don't do that, then you've got another thing coming too.
[01:12:31.728 --> 01:12:32.869]  Let's just be real about this.
[01:12:34.009 --> 01:12:37.391]  You know, when a 2,000 pound bomb drops into a place that kills 500 civilians,
[01:12:38.419 --> 01:12:39.500]  It's called collateral damage.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.541]  When a Muslim does it up close, it's called the end of Earth.
[01:12:42.581 --> 01:12:43.501]  Give up all your rights.
[01:12:43.841 --> 01:12:46.042]  Oh my God, we're so scared the boogeyman's going to get us.
[01:12:48.103 --> 01:12:54.546]  Now, the bottom line here is that there is really four different types of terrorism.
[01:12:55.126 --> 01:12:55.426]  Okay?
[01:12:55.446 --> 01:12:59.608]  There is the state-sponsored, purely state-sponsored events like 9-11.
[01:13:00.048 --> 01:13:03.450]  Big, spectacular events like 9-11.
[01:13:04.483 --> 01:13:05.304]  That the official U.S.
[01:13:05.324 --> 01:13:17.053]  government plan to carry it out, Operation Northwoods, talks about big spectacular events to cause a helpful wave of national indignation and to launch a new war, as Brzezinski talks about, or as Dick Cheney talks about in the Phenak documents.
[01:13:17.934 --> 01:13:22.077]  Needing that big Pearl Harbor-style attack to launch the New World Order.
[01:13:23.238 --> 01:13:25.820]  And to re-kick-start the stalled program in 2000.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:28.222]  They said, we don't have a big terror attack.
[01:13:28.462 --> 01:13:30.384]  We have Republican memos, too.
[01:13:30.664 --> 01:13:33.086]  If we don't have big terror attacks, it's over!
[01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:36.350]  That people will not go along with expanding war in a world government.
[01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:37.490]  We've got to have them.
[01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:38.190]  Boom, they happen.
[01:13:38.511 --> 01:13:40.211]  Then you look at the evidence, it's an inside job.
[01:13:42.632 --> 01:13:44.692]  So you've got the big spectacular events.
[01:13:45.853 --> 01:13:48.253]  Then you've got two different types of provocateur actions.
[01:13:48.273 --> 01:13:52.375]  You've got, well there's even more types than that, but two basics.
[01:13:52.415 --> 01:14:02.838]  But you've got where the government goes out here in the US and recruits literally mentally retarded black street children in Miami for a year and a half, gives them over a hundred thousand dollars,
[01:14:03.362 --> 01:14:07.325]  They found young, literally retarded, black, Rasta children.
[01:14:08.366 --> 01:14:15.071]  And they told them, you know, you're Christians, we want to bring you to this warehouse, give you machine guns, weapons, you're going to fight for Jesus.
[01:14:15.091 --> 01:14:20.915]  And they said, you get another $20,000 if you'll go videotape the FBI building and say that you're going to be part of a crimson jihad.
[01:14:21.616 --> 01:14:24.618]  And they gave them another $20,000, they went and videotaped it, and they literally were retarded.
[01:14:24.658 --> 01:14:25.659]  That later came out in the news.
[01:14:26.249 --> 01:14:33.579]  I mean, I could go out and provocateur homeless people for bottles of whiskey to say they were going to carry out attacks and then slap handcuffs on them.
[01:14:35.061 --> 01:14:36.223]  This is just more sophisticated.
[01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:40.669]  There's that type of provocateur action, and we saw that last year up in
[01:14:44.099 --> 01:14:53.905]  Toronto, Canada, where they couldn't get the teenagers to shoot their mouths off, so the Royal Mounties just delivered thousands of pounds of fertilizer to the door and busted them.
[01:14:53.925 --> 01:15:01.029]  A few months later that all came out in court, but by then you'd already heard the fair mongering in front of the papers, you never read the retraction, which you can go pull up if you'd like.
[01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:09.994]  And we heard about riots and plots in London, how they were going to kill everybody, and there have literally been more than 20 of those different plots that turned out to be totally fake.
[01:15:11.147 --> 01:15:16.892]  When we get back, I'll tell you about the other type of provocateur actions, and then real terror, and why this is probably real terror.
[01:15:17.773 --> 01:15:24.498]  And then we'll talk about another form of real terror, using an event to fearmonger and terrorize the people psychologically.
[01:15:25.119 --> 01:15:28.141]  Then we'll take your calls, and a lot more.
[01:15:28.822 --> 01:15:29.682]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:29.742 --> 01:15:37.389]  My news websites, again, are JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:37.409 --> 01:15:39.070]  They've all got a lot of powerful news and info.
[01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:39.771]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:42.291]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:53.080]  Attention!
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.001]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:15:56.321 --> 01:16:00.601]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:16:00.941 --> 01:16:01.622]  Listen closely.
[01:16:02.262 --> 01:16:09.723]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:16:10.023 --> 01:16:18.784]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:16:19.104 --> 01:16:22.045]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[01:16:22.285 --> 01:16:24.607]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:16:24.907 --> 01:16:34.373]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:16:34.553 --> 01:16:40.196]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.

[01:16:54.119 --> 01:16:55.159]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:16:55.479 --> 01:16:58.280]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:02.702]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:17:03.122 --> 01:17:03.962]  So what do you do?
[01:17:04.262 --> 01:17:08.824]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:11.446]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:17:11.947 --> 01:17:26.641]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:17:26.681 --> 01:17:33.748]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:56.637]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:17:57.017 --> 01:17:59.959]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:18:00.279 --> 01:18:02.841]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:08.024]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:18:08.404 --> 01:18:13.768]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:18:14.068 --> 01:18:17.030]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:17.910]  We're good to go.
[01:18:40.618 --> 01:18:40.858]  We're good.
[01:18:52.699 --> 01:18:56.562]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:18:56.822 --> 01:19:00.685]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[01:19:01.045 --> 01:19:06.069]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[01:19:06.349 --> 01:19:17.537]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalinize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[01:19:17.857 --> 01:19:22.201]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[01:19:22.461 --> 01:19:31.809]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified, RO water but not tap water, microstructured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[01:19:31.949 --> 01:19:41.577]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Miracle Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel, Sport Performance Drink, and 888-212-8871

[01:19:48.301 --> 01:19:51.162]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I, Medical.com.

[01:19:57.145 --> 01:20:01.407]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:04.348]  Raging for the truth.
[01:20:04.949 --> 01:20:06.349]  Exposing corruption.
[01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:10.211]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[01:20:10.671 --> 01:20:12.152]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:17.899]  You know, I talk to really intelligent neighbors who I know own successful businesses.
[01:20:18.059 --> 01:20:20.401]  I talk to family who I know are pretty well informed.
[01:20:21.042 --> 01:20:22.283]  And they'll go, what's eugenics?
[01:20:22.323 --> 01:20:23.343]  I've heard of that before.
[01:20:24.324 --> 01:20:34.152]  Folks, you better find out what eugenics is because that pseudoscience that really grew out of Thomas Malthus and then into Galton and
[01:20:35.575 --> 01:20:36.316]  Runs everything.
[01:20:36.656 --> 01:20:38.597]  That's the religion of the global elite.
[01:20:38.637 --> 01:20:44.301]  But you know elites were already into inbreeding and thinking that they were the best and they were gods compared to the commoners.
[01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:47.504]  And elites have always wanted excuses to feed on the population.
[01:20:47.924 --> 01:20:51.707]  Well, they just scientifically codified this in the last 200 years, but really in the last 150.
[01:20:51.927 --> 01:20:53.968]  And the U.S.
[01:20:54.029 --> 01:20:55.009]  and England pioneered it.
[01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:56.851]  It was born in England.
[01:20:56.871 --> 01:20:57.371]  The U.S.
[01:20:57.431 --> 01:20:58.091]  energized it.
[01:20:58.452 --> 01:20:59.993]  Mexico, Japan picked it up.
[01:21:01.109 --> 01:21:09.815]  And they had fitter families contest, churches had the best contest, they had billboards up around the country saying, Jesus believes in eugenics.
[01:21:10.575 --> 01:21:17.559]  And the CPS, the Health and Human Services, was founded in England in around 1900.
[01:21:17.619 --> 01:21:19.700]  Within five years they had it here.
[01:21:20.381 --> 01:21:29.066]  And over 400 plus thousand women that we know of, when we started keeping records, 40s until the 80s, were forced sterilized.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:33.802]  We know that it was hundreds of thousands before that, and many of them were killed.
[01:21:34.482 --> 01:21:39.043]  In fact, we even have newsreels where it shows the good doctor refusing to take care of a sick baby.
[01:21:39.884 --> 01:21:43.325]  And so now you hear about right to die and hemlock societies and all of this.
[01:21:43.705 --> 01:21:45.066]  It all rolls together.
[01:21:45.446 --> 01:21:50.228]  And let me tell you something, it's so diabolical that I've actually been having nightmares about it, okay?
[01:21:50.788 --> 01:21:52.028]  Now, let me explain something to you folks.
[01:21:52.088 --> 01:21:53.209]  I've had people threaten to kill me.
[01:21:53.249 --> 01:21:54.249]  I've been physically attacked.
[01:21:54.716 --> 01:21:58.638]  I've had all sorts of stuff happen, and it's never freaked me out.
[01:21:58.798 --> 01:22:00.419]  Learning about this, and I thought I knew.
[01:22:01.059 --> 01:22:02.700]  Now I'm learning it runs everything.
[01:22:03.441 --> 01:22:05.061]  I mean, these people are everywhere.
[01:22:05.442 --> 01:22:06.482]  It is a death cult.
[01:22:07.082 --> 01:22:08.643]  I mean, that's all you can call it, is a cult.
[01:22:09.083 --> 01:22:09.484]  The Nazis!
[01:22:09.564 --> 01:22:11.605]  You know, they wore skull and crossbones on their hats.
[01:22:12.205 --> 01:22:17.088]  Arnold Schwarzenegger three weeks ago is on the front page of Time Magazine wearing an SS Nazi belt buckle.
[01:22:17.588 --> 01:22:19.329]  I knew I'd seen those before at gun shows.
[01:22:19.409 --> 01:22:20.109]  Hundreds of dollars.
[01:22:20.489 --> 01:22:21.110]  Authentic SS
[01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:27.291]  He's wearing a death's head, not when his dad of course was a high-level SS officer.
[01:22:27.591 --> 01:22:32.252]  He's wearing a Nazi belt buckle on the cover of Time Magazine with Mayor Bloomberg.
[01:22:32.292 --> 01:22:32.492]  See?
[01:22:32.772 --> 01:22:33.732]  In our face!
[01:22:34.933 --> 01:22:36.013]  In our face!
[01:22:36.993 --> 01:22:38.233]  I've had enough of it!
[01:22:39.693 --> 01:22:41.034]  I can't handle it anymore!
[01:22:44.694 --> 01:22:45.715]  Alright, I'm digressing here.
[01:22:47.115 --> 01:22:47.775]  I'm digressing.
[01:22:49.304 --> 01:22:55.107]  The official UN documents, and by the way, they want to put this debate into a left-right paradigm.
[01:22:55.468 --> 01:23:00.311]  They want to make you think conservatives are against this, and Bush is against this, and, oh, don't worry, it's not going to happen.
[01:23:00.971 --> 01:23:02.632]  I have documents with Bush Sr.
[01:23:02.872 --> 01:23:11.857]  in 1990, talking to Mikhail Gorbachev and the UN and others, and to the French Prime Minister, about how do we get a carbon tax passed?
[01:23:12.198 --> 01:23:13.759]  And they said, should it be a tax on the wellhead?
[01:23:13.779 --> 01:23:15.880]  And they said, no, we want it to be on human activity.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:16.740]  Well, that's going to be harder.
[01:23:17.001 --> 01:23:17.741]  How are they going to get it?
[01:23:20.874 --> 01:23:27.217]  And now I have mainstream articles where they're now announcing, oh yeah, the carbon tax is going to be also on your children.
[01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:34.360]  And now England, and Germany, and France, and they're talking about passing in here, this is Times of London, a tax if you have more than one child.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:35.480]  See, that's a one-child policy.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.001]  That's how it started in China in the 60s, was a tax.
[01:23:38.302 --> 01:23:39.802]  Then in 80, they said it's the law.
[01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:45.685]  And now, mainstream news, if you've had more than two, they will come take your baby and drown it in front of you.
[01:23:46.245 --> 01:23:48.026]  And then they take the baby for medical experiments.
[01:23:49.195 --> 01:23:49.435]  Okay?
[01:23:50.756 --> 01:23:51.857]  They have forced abortion.
[01:23:52.237 --> 01:23:55.920]  Now, you may be all for abortion out there, folks, but are you for forced abortion?
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:00.023]  I would think nobody is, but actually some of, when I've talked about it, have emailed me defending it.
[01:24:00.483 --> 01:24:04.085]  Now, Pat Robertson, of all people, remember five years ago, got in all that trouble?
[01:24:04.626 --> 01:24:09.129]  He came and said, well, China is having forced abortions and infanticide, but they're doing what they have to do.
[01:24:09.429 --> 01:24:13.472]  And that was on CNN, and his clarification was, well, yeah, they got a lot of people.
[01:24:15.211 --> 01:24:18.893]  Once you let government have that power, folks, you're going to get a Nazi Germany.
[01:24:18.913 --> 01:24:19.893]  You're going to get a Stalin.
[01:24:20.053 --> 01:24:22.774]  I learned Stalin was funded by the U.S.
[01:24:22.834 --> 01:24:24.575]  and British governments to carry out this stuff.
[01:24:24.795 --> 01:24:34.479]  You always hear about all the poor, starving Russian orphans and orphanages with thousands of kids, naked, and piles of, you know what, all over the floor.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:35.920]  That was eugenics!
[01:24:38.081 --> 01:24:44.664]  I didn't know that the whole Chinese system was eugenics and that they were getting IMF World Bank loans and being developed because they agreed to do it.
[01:24:45.376 --> 01:24:51.320]  I mean, my God, folks, we are in so much trouble, I cannot even tell you.
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:53.222]  It just gets worse and worse.
[01:24:53.322 --> 01:24:56.524]  I always think I know it all, and then, my God, it gets ten times worse.
[01:24:57.004 --> 01:24:58.165]  People say I overstate things.
[01:24:58.345 --> 01:25:00.747]  I cannot state to you how bad it is.
[01:25:00.947 --> 01:25:12.816]  I cannot even... So, the very elite running things, the founder of the Human Genome Project ran the Coal Springs Harbor Research Facility, the big national eugenics lab in the U.S.
[01:25:12.976 --> 01:25:14.297]  that Hitler learned everything from.
[01:25:16.061 --> 01:25:19.563]  The modern genome is for the elites to have all the cures and the people to have nothing.
[01:25:20.004 --> 01:25:21.144]  And they're putting bio-weapons.
[01:25:21.164 --> 01:25:22.645]  They've been caught in the vaccines.
[01:25:22.665 --> 01:25:28.549]  They've been caught in mainstream news putting pathogens and vaccines in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to sterilize the women.
[01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:31.291]  They've been caught doing it here.
[01:25:31.431 --> 01:25:35.133]  They've been caught putting cancer viruses, more than 20 varieties, in different shots.
[01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:37.195]  Not just polio and SV40.
[01:25:37.755 --> 01:25:39.176]  And it's still going on.
[01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:43.098]  Of course cancer's up by several thousand percentage points the last 30 years.
[01:25:43.319 --> 01:25:45.340]  And who funded research on cancer?
[01:25:46.092 --> 01:25:50.114]  And on cancer viruses, I got the documents from UT of all places.
[01:25:51.655 --> 01:25:51.695]  1920s!
[01:25:52.275 --> 01:25:55.517]  UT pioneered fluoride in the water to make you docile.
[01:25:55.677 --> 01:25:58.658]  Then I found out Pulitzer Prize winning books about World War II.
[01:25:58.858 --> 01:26:00.699]  Admit, it wasn't a wives' tale.
[01:26:00.999 --> 01:26:03.961]  The Nazis really did put it in the water in the camps to make them docile.
[01:26:04.881 --> 01:26:06.802]  My God, it's all true, folks!
[01:26:07.022 --> 01:26:08.503]  They're running everything!
[01:26:09.568 --> 01:26:11.809]  Everything, all the major institutions.
[01:26:12.009 --> 01:26:13.610]  There's pockets of resistance out there.
[01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:24.295]  YouTube, stations like you're listening to us on right now, whether it's in Kansas City, or upstate New York, or Tennessee, or California.
[01:26:26.316 --> 01:26:30.178]  Just God, I mean, and there's so many facets, so much info I've got.
[01:26:32.939 --> 01:26:35.040]  I mean, I don't even know what to say.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.682]  We don't just read some quote on some eugenics university
[01:26:39.598 --> 01:26:45.583]  Harvard University History of Eugenics site, or Kansas State, or... We have all those.
[01:26:45.603 --> 01:26:47.224]  We actually go and order the books.
[01:26:47.324 --> 01:26:48.045]  We buy them.
[01:26:48.385 --> 01:26:49.166]  And they come.
[01:26:50.187 --> 01:26:53.650]  We've paid like a hundred bucks before for some rare book written by a eugenicist.
[01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:56.372]  We don't just take the university's word.
[01:26:56.432 --> 01:26:57.693]  We get the stuff!
[01:26:58.213 --> 01:26:59.795]  We go and read in Mein Kampf.
[01:27:00.435 --> 01:27:02.096]  Yes, we went and got Mein Kampf.
[01:27:03.437 --> 01:27:04.358]  We went and read it.
[01:27:04.739 --> 01:27:07.621]  It's in there, thanking America for teaching him everything he knew.
[01:27:09.096 --> 01:27:11.440]  That piece of filth riding that in 1924!
[01:27:16.349 --> 01:27:17.872]  And then they protected all those Nazis?
[01:27:18.393 --> 01:27:20.717]  Not just for rocketry or weapons, but eugenics!
[01:27:24.311 --> 01:27:25.812]  And so they've got all these names for it.
[01:27:26.152 --> 01:27:38.117]  Meanwhile, the very group are the ones doing cross-species splicing, which the top Nobel Prize winners, the real scientists, are saying is deadly dangerous and could actually cause a chain reaction in the biospheres.
[01:27:38.517 --> 01:27:39.818]  That could really mess up the Earth.
[01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:45.440]  I mean, this Earth developed with the radiation of the sun, all the volcanic activities, huge meteor impacts.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.561]  It's hard to kill life.
[01:27:47.121 --> 01:27:47.901]  Life is tough.
[01:27:48.442 --> 01:27:49.402]  The Earth is resilient.
[01:27:49.904 --> 01:27:54.606]  But you start tinkering with new genetic forms, it is already causing major crises.
[01:27:54.626 --> 01:28:10.492]  It's conclusively been proven that the main, of all the ingredients, the main cocktail, the main ingredient in the cocktail is this BT corn from Monsanto that has a, where the plant produces a pesticide so other bugs won't eat it, but honeybees still will and they're dying.
[01:28:10.932 --> 01:28:11.873]  Well, that's hard to believe.
[01:28:11.893 --> 01:28:12.413]  Oh, really?
[01:28:15.274 --> 01:28:17.135]  That's just one example of what we're talking about.
[01:28:18.959 --> 01:28:21.281]  Yes, they can make the corn, grow the pesticide they want.
[01:28:22.682 --> 01:28:32.930]  And please, if you're some geneticist out there, don't email me and go, well, Monsanto only engineered that the plant grow internally a fungus that naturally grows on the outside in very small amounts.
[01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:40.376]  This is hundreds of times higher of the fungus that's been engineered and altered and it secretes internally in the plant.
[01:28:41.076 --> 01:28:41.457]  Okay?
[01:28:41.717 --> 01:28:45.520]  For different absorption in the guts of the insects and the humans.
[01:28:46.306 --> 01:28:48.927]  I actually, this isn't me, I interview the top scientists.
[01:28:49.087 --> 01:28:50.348]  I constantly read the papers.
[01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:52.669]  They're scientific papers.
[01:28:53.009 --> 01:28:54.770]  You understand we're eating this stuff?
[01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:58.011]  You understand upwards of 30% of the corn you eat has it in it?
[01:28:59.572 --> 01:29:00.592]  Pesticide!
[01:29:02.133 --> 01:29:03.294]  It's killing the bees!
[01:29:04.634 --> 01:29:05.555]  Are they, so folks,
[01:29:07.069 --> 01:29:11.011]  Nerve gasping, dumping the ocean everywhere, burning all the trees down, stuff like that is important.
[01:29:11.471 --> 01:29:17.914]  But the stuff Al Gore and Lord Rothschild are bringing forward does absolutely nothing to deal with that.
[01:29:18.254 --> 01:29:18.635]  Nothing!
[01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:27.399]  It takes your rightful concern and you put all your energy in there like a bunch of suckers to go pay money for these concerts and you go to these things
[01:29:28.424 --> 01:29:29.685]  Are you lacking energy on a daily basis?
[01:29:29.705 --> 01:29:30.865]  Do you feel tired all the time?
[01:29:59.110 --> 01:30:02.351]  It's time for you to try A.C.T., the healthy energy drink.
[01:30:02.591 --> 01:30:03.132]  A.C.T.
[01:30:03.172 --> 01:30:08.554]  helps your body with a natural blend of fruit extracts, herbs, and vitamins to deliver healthy cellular energy.
[01:30:08.734 --> 01:30:09.274]  A.C.T.
[01:30:09.334 --> 01:30:13.596]  contains no caffeine, 4 grams of sugar, and only 22 calories per serving.
[01:30:13.896 --> 01:30:14.356]  A.C.T.
[01:30:14.396 --> 01:30:16.297]  works within minutes, lasts for hours.
[01:30:16.557 --> 01:30:17.117]  A.C.T.
[01:30:17.217 --> 01:30:19.458]  is the healthy, feel-good energy drink.
[01:30:19.678 --> 01:30:21.819]  Enjoy big savings by ordering A.C.T.
[01:30:21.879 --> 01:30:23.920]  wholesale from your own free website.
[01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:25.541]  Share your website with friends.
[01:30:25.821 --> 01:30:29.002]  Go to GCNlive.com and click on the sponsors link.
[01:30:29.002 --> 01:30:29.422]  I think so.
[01:30:52.617 --> 01:30:55.240]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:00.605]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:00.965 --> 01:31:02.686]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:03.007 --> 01:31:07.551]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:07.551 --> 01:31:08.072]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.994 --> 01:31:31.995]  How much will you need?
[01:31:32.215 --> 01:31:32.836]  We don't know.
[01:31:33.116 --> 01:31:34.037]  How much do you want?
[01:31:34.217 --> 01:31:34.978]  All you can get.
[01:31:35.158 --> 01:31:36.019]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:36.259 --> 01:31:39.022]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:39.322 --> 01:31:41.304]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:41.324 --> 01:31:42.005]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:54.354 --> 01:31:58.878]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:31:59.198 --> 01:32:03.282]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:32:03.622 --> 01:32:04.123]  We listened.
[01:32:04.443 --> 01:32:09.427]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:32:09.648 --> 01:32:10.188]  We listened.
[01:32:10.568 --> 01:32:13.611]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:32:14.072 --> 01:32:14.572]  We listened.
[01:32:15.053 --> 01:32:18.916]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:32:19.496 --> 01:32:19.857]  I think so.
[01:32:35.448 --> 01:32:38.090]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[01:32:38.290 --> 01:32:38.490]  Only $279.
[01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:39.130]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:39.410]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:41.091]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:32:41.111 --> 01:32:42.072]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:32:51.688 --> 01:33:03.639]  JLS Research, the makers of the all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates that those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[01:33:03.799 --> 01:33:10.524]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[01:33:10.665 --> 01:33:18.011]  By using organic and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[01:33:18.371 --> 01:33:21.434]  As it responds, body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[01:33:21.714 --> 01:33:25.337]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[01:33:25.638 --> 01:33:29.041]  Grape seed skins, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[01:33:29.301 --> 01:33:33.925]  It's so effective, you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[01:33:34.246 --> 01:33:35.427]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[01:33:37.128 --> 01:33:39.309]  Go online and order First Responder at no-bo.com.
[01:33:39.349 --> 01:33:40.470]  Visit no-bo.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.810]  That's 850-723-8599.
[01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:41.551]  You're listening to GCN.
[01:33:41.591 --> 01:33:43.252]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:33:43.312 --> 01:33:44.152]  Raging for the truth.
[01:33:44.192 --> 01:33:44.993]  Exposing corruption.
[01:34:07.009 --> 01:34:10.151]  Dismantling a false left-right paradigm.
[01:34:10.712 --> 01:34:12.133]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:34:13.354 --> 01:34:14.695]  Let me just give you a news flash.
[01:34:15.215 --> 01:34:35.651]  It isn't just possible, it is somewhat likely, according to the entire body of the physicists that look at this, that if you slam antimatter particles into anything it could cause, a chain reaction that would make all of our nuclear weapons detonating at once look like child's play,
[01:34:36.161 --> 01:34:42.002]  Slamming it into uranium and plutonium isotopes makes it probable... Let me give you a news flash.
[01:34:42.342 --> 01:34:43.803]  They are doing it.
[01:34:44.403 --> 01:34:44.703]  Okay?
[01:34:45.343 --> 01:34:50.864]  And if we all die and it blows up the whole planet or the solar system or creates a black hole, don't worry, you just won't feel anything.
[01:34:50.884 --> 01:34:53.865]  You might feel a split second of heat on your cheek, maybe.
[01:34:53.905 --> 01:34:55.265]  Just, oh, you're gone.
[01:34:55.505 --> 01:34:56.485]  Boom, evaporated.
[01:34:56.765 --> 01:34:58.686]  The government's wildly running around doing that.
[01:34:59.506 --> 01:35:02.607]  I know, nuclear reactors and stuff don't exist either, right?
[01:35:02.647 --> 01:35:03.927]  There's not two of them here in Austin.
[01:35:04.375 --> 01:35:07.717]  Every time I mention that we've got reactors here in town... Hey, Trey, I mean, I know you're a smart guy.
[01:35:07.737 --> 01:35:08.677]  I'm not putting you down.
[01:35:08.737 --> 01:35:10.198]  Did you know we have reactors here in town?
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.201]  Every time I talk about that, people... Did not know that.
[01:35:15.361 --> 01:35:17.061]  Yeah, yeah, we have reactors.
[01:35:17.422 --> 01:35:17.882]  Right here in town.
[01:35:18.402 --> 01:35:20.643]  But they don't want to bother the public with those, though.
[01:35:21.083 --> 01:35:22.124]  Everything's alright.
[01:35:22.704 --> 01:35:26.286]  We have someone who disagrees, and I'll go to Paula and Kerry.
[01:35:26.326 --> 01:35:27.507]  I promise I'll get to Paula and Kerry.
[01:35:27.807 --> 01:35:31.028]  But Neil in Colorado disagrees with me about stem cell research.
[01:35:31.289 --> 01:35:33.870]  Well, seeing as I didn't talk about stem cell research,
[01:35:35.094 --> 01:35:39.898]  Boy, I didn't know how he disagrees with me, but see, that's one of these fake national debates they have.
[01:35:40.238 --> 01:35:41.119]  Oh, is Bush for it?
[01:35:41.159 --> 01:35:41.739]  Is he against it?
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.421]  They didn't stop any of it.
[01:35:43.441 --> 01:35:45.562]  It was just federal funds for that on the books.
[01:35:46.403 --> 01:35:50.406]  By the way, there's trillions that have been spent in the aggregate in the last 50 years on secret genetic projects.
[01:35:51.247 --> 01:35:51.847]  Trillions.
[01:35:52.608 --> 01:35:55.390]  Let's go ahead and go to Neil in Colorado.
[01:35:55.410 --> 01:35:56.010]  Go ahead, Neil.
[01:35:56.530 --> 01:35:56.951]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:57.011 --> 01:35:58.872]  Alex, I just want to say God bless you, sir.
[01:35:58.892 --> 01:36:01.214]  You're a great American, and I've been trying to get in for a long time.
[01:36:01.553 --> 01:36:02.433]  Pleasure to talk with you.
[01:36:02.453 --> 01:36:05.394]  Well, it's a pleasure to talk to you, but I'm not a great person.
[01:36:05.654 --> 01:36:06.394]  I'm doing my job.
[01:36:06.414 --> 01:36:06.734]  Go ahead.
[01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:07.095]  Okay.
[01:36:07.115 --> 01:36:07.275]  Yeah.
[01:36:07.355 --> 01:36:07.615]  Okay.
[01:36:07.635 --> 01:36:11.476]  I just want to say, I'm like a lot of your, sirs, I'm actually blind.
[01:36:11.616 --> 01:36:19.338]  That's why I'm interested in stem cell research because... Do you know they can get just as good cells out of the breast?
[01:36:19.598 --> 01:36:20.158]  Out of a breast?
[01:36:20.518 --> 01:36:22.219]  Out of your sister or your mother's breast.
[01:36:22.259 --> 01:36:22.539]  Really?
[01:36:22.879 --> 01:36:24.439]  Now that works even better.
[01:36:24.899 --> 01:36:25.140]  Yeah.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:25.360]  Okay.
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:26.700]  Now you can get it out from any woman.
[01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:33.650]  Yeah, because I think that stem cell research really is pretty scary in patients, but there are a lot of very, very good
[01:36:34.512 --> 01:36:45.296]  Let's be clear, that is taking human cells and putting them in Parkinson's patients' brains or in your nerve clusters, but sir, they already have electrodes in the brain that can give you pretty good sight.
[01:36:45.576 --> 01:36:48.617]  It's just that you're never going to be able to probably get it because the elite isn't going to let you have it.
[01:36:48.877 --> 01:36:55.359]  They're going to blow out the economy, bring in socialized health care first to give them control to make sure you don't get all the life extension.
[01:36:55.579 --> 01:36:56.520]  That's what this is all about.
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:00.181]  The elite want to cull our population, reduce our numbers because they don't want to give
[01:37:00.901 --> 01:37:03.904]  If you're 40 years old, you should be able to live to be 150.
[01:37:04.104 --> 01:37:06.126]  That's what all the top scientists are saying right now.
[01:37:07.186 --> 01:37:11.850]  Sir, they've got thousands of secret cures, hundreds in the public.
[01:37:12.351 --> 01:37:14.552]  It's just that they've never allowed widespread development.
[01:37:15.253 --> 01:37:17.354]  Really?
[01:37:18.676 --> 01:37:27.823]  You haven't heard that they've successfully, for at least 10 years, been doing the neuron implants and giving clear
[01:37:28.337 --> 01:37:29.518]  I mean, black and white sight.
[01:37:29.538 --> 01:37:31.019]  I mean, you could see... No way.
[01:37:31.039 --> 01:37:33.221]  To totally blind people?
[01:37:33.361 --> 01:37:33.761]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:34.362 --> 01:37:35.162]  You've got to be kidding me.
[01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:36.083]  I haven't heard that at all.
[01:37:36.143 --> 01:37:36.884]  At least 10 years.
[01:37:37.304 --> 01:37:38.785]  Actually, secret documents have been released.
[01:37:38.805 --> 01:37:43.609]  They were doing it in the 50s, but that was just, you know, black and white where you could see blobs.
[01:37:44.049 --> 01:37:49.373]  Now, depending on how many neuroinsertions they do into the tissues of the brain, it's very small.
[01:37:49.673 --> 01:37:51.155]  It's just a surgery right to the eye.
[01:37:51.475 --> 01:37:52.336]  Works quite nicely.
[01:37:52.836 --> 01:37:53.937]  Wow, that's incredible.
[01:37:54.037 --> 01:37:55.458]  I have another quick question for you.
[01:37:56.019 --> 01:37:57.160]  I've been thinking a lot about this.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:05.645]  You know, all the presidents that we've had, you know, in the past however long, you know, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, they're all obviously, you know, New World Order.
[01:38:05.665 --> 01:38:06.985]  Total puppets run nothing.
[01:38:07.325 --> 01:38:07.506]  Yeah.
[01:38:08.026 --> 01:38:10.887]  Reagan was the running thing and was good at first, so they shot him.
[01:38:10.907 --> 01:38:11.188]  Go ahead.
[01:38:11.568 --> 01:38:16.651]  Have we ever in our entire history of America had a president that wasn't that?
[01:38:16.671 --> 01:38:24.115]  Yes, we have had good presidents off and on, but after they killed Kennedy, we have had nothing but pure evil.
[01:38:24.577 --> 01:38:25.458]  Yeah.
[01:38:25.478 --> 01:38:28.540]  Could you just give me a few examples of ones that would have been good ones?
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:29.440]  Well then, yes.
[01:38:29.901 --> 01:38:31.162]  Then this will start big debates.
[01:38:31.802 --> 01:38:33.903]  Okay, now remember, the times they were in.
[01:38:33.923 --> 01:38:36.305]  There was slavery going on in Africa too at the same time.
[01:38:36.565 --> 01:38:37.286]  Black on black.
[01:38:37.646 --> 01:38:40.468]  Blacks always want to go become Muslims, and I'm not attacking them for that.
[01:38:40.488 --> 01:38:42.770]  My point is, they think Muslims fought the slave trades.
[01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:43.830]  Muslims wrote the book on it.
[01:38:44.731 --> 01:38:47.633]  At least in more modern times with transatlantic, they taught the Europeans how to do it.
[01:38:48.817 --> 01:38:51.159]  He was pro-slavery, folks, but back then it wasn't a question.
[01:38:51.579 --> 01:38:55.702]  Andrew Jackson, if you want anti-New World Order president, who really was for the United States.
[01:38:56.302 --> 01:38:57.883]  He wasn't good for Native Americans or blacks.
[01:38:57.903 --> 01:39:03.047]  But if you want to talk about who was anti-New World Order, Andrew Jackson's as good as it gets, okay?
[01:39:03.107 --> 01:39:04.387]  George Washington was the real deal.
[01:39:04.768 --> 01:39:06.129]  Thomas Jefferson was the real deal.
[01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:09.651]  Anybody they assassinated was the real deal.
[01:39:10.191 --> 01:39:11.232]  And there was quite a few of those.
[01:39:12.433 --> 01:39:16.976]  But they have been totally bought and paid for
[01:39:17.586 --> 01:39:19.927]  Since they greased Kennedy 43 years ago.
[01:39:20.508 --> 01:39:21.868]  Okay, I've got to hurry here.
[01:39:22.288 --> 01:39:26.010]  Paula, in Florida, and then we'll go to Kerry.
[01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:27.831]  Then I've got to get some final news here.
[01:39:28.411 --> 01:39:29.872]  Paula, you are on the air.
[01:39:29.932 --> 01:39:30.232]  Welcome.
[01:39:32.153 --> 01:39:32.834]  Oh no, that's Kerry.
[01:39:32.974 --> 01:39:34.294]  We'll just go ahead and Kerry now and Lovett.
[01:39:34.334 --> 01:39:34.575]  Go ahead.
[01:39:34.955 --> 01:39:35.595]  Lovett, Texas.
[01:39:35.915 --> 01:39:36.816]  Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[01:39:36.836 --> 01:39:38.717]  Hey, I have two or three questions right quick.
[01:39:38.977 --> 01:39:41.398]  There's a movie going around on the internet called Zeke Geist.
[01:39:42.205 --> 01:39:43.625]  It's got some quotes from you on it.
[01:39:43.645 --> 01:39:44.806]  I was wondering if you were aware of it.
[01:39:44.866 --> 01:39:47.006]  Yeah, I don't agree with the thing about Jesus at the front.
[01:39:47.046 --> 01:39:47.506]  That's not true.
[01:39:47.546 --> 01:39:48.246]  It's been disproven.
[01:39:48.666 --> 01:39:51.347]  And I can't help what people do with clips of me and stuff.
[01:39:51.607 --> 01:39:55.088]  But overall, it's got some good 9-11 info, but it's kind of like rat poison.
[01:39:55.128 --> 01:39:58.529]  You know, it's 98% nutritious, but it's the 2% that gets the rat.
[01:39:59.029 --> 01:39:59.309]  All right.
[01:39:59.809 --> 01:40:04.330]  And then I was wondering, you mentioned last Thursday about the United Nations Living Zones.
[01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:05.890]  Can you tell the person where they can find that?
[01:40:06.230 --> 01:40:09.831]  And then my last deal is... What, the United Nations Corridor Biosphere Zones?
[01:40:10.447 --> 01:40:16.228]  Yeah, well, they're talking about they're going to do population reduction and they're going to have these zones that humans can live in.
[01:40:16.248 --> 01:40:21.969]  Oh, thousands of pages, hundreds of... UNESCO documents, eugenics documents, it's all on my film, Endgame.
[01:40:22.810 --> 01:40:28.831]  Just type in biosphere, compact cities, type in global one-child policy.
[01:40:28.851 --> 01:40:30.191]  Do you have a computer?
[01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:31.151]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:31.351 --> 01:40:31.511]  Yes.
[01:40:31.751 --> 01:40:33.012]  Just do keywords on that.
[01:40:33.032 --> 01:40:34.092]  I don't have those in front of me.
[01:40:34.432 --> 01:40:38.953]  I mean, it's basically hundreds of books, thousands of documents, CIA documents.
[01:40:39.073 --> 01:40:40.093]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[01:40:40.766 --> 01:40:48.952]  And the last thing, most important, and this is very important, Alex, is, you know, in Texas, it's legal to use deadly force in defense of a third person.
[01:40:49.432 --> 01:40:58.538]  And I think we need to realize that the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, and these type of people, anybody that you've lost in a war or to cancer, is the blood of those people is on their hands.
[01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:04.943]  And I think that we need to make these people, these families, pay for their transgressions against humanity.
[01:41:05.598 --> 01:41:09.200]  Well, listen, I am not calling for physical violence against people.
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:13.804]  They want to make it a physical game so they can preemptively try to stop our free speech.
[01:41:13.824 --> 01:41:15.925]  Look, they're trying to ban videotaping cops in New York.
[01:41:16.305 --> 01:41:17.586]  Total attack on the First Amendment.
[01:41:17.786 --> 01:41:19.187]  That is textbook police state.
[01:41:19.567 --> 01:41:20.808]  Textbook Soviet Union.
[01:41:21.268 --> 01:41:22.069]  Death of America.
[01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:26.892]  There's a lot of things that are happening now, like torture, secret arrest of citizens.
[01:41:26.972 --> 01:41:27.973]  That's total police state.
[01:41:28.253 --> 01:41:29.334]  People say, well, you're still on air.
[01:41:29.997 --> 01:41:33.998]  There are people on air until 41, you know, speaking out against Hitler.
[01:41:34.018 --> 01:41:36.998]  He didn't grab the biggest people until the end, until the war had already started.
[01:41:38.218 --> 01:41:40.319]  We're trying to fight going into a full-bore police state.
[01:41:40.339 --> 01:41:41.459]  It's like steps downward.
[01:41:41.479 --> 01:41:43.539]  You know, we're halfway down the stairs towards hell.
[01:41:43.959 --> 01:41:44.880]  And I'm trying to stop that.
[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:46.960]  And again, when I say police state, it doesn't mean the average cop.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.760]  It means the system is out of control.
[01:41:52.001 --> 01:41:54.221]  I do not, you know, there are some good Rockefellers, I guarantee you.
[01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:55.281]  There are some good Rothschilds.
[01:41:55.361 --> 01:41:56.962]  It's the prominent ones that we know are evil.
[01:41:57.122 --> 01:41:58.162]  I don't wish them any harm.
[01:41:58.647 --> 01:42:03.950]  I want to intellectually defeat them, I want to expose them, and then I want a jury of their peers.
[01:42:05.130 --> 01:42:06.891]  Grand juries to call for indictments.
[01:42:06.951 --> 01:42:08.352]  I mean, that's how this needs to work.
[01:42:09.072 --> 01:42:16.656]  I agree, the Rockefeller documents on eugenics that David was part of, he needs to be, grand juries need to get those and he needs to be indicted.
[01:42:17.637 --> 01:42:19.658]  I'll call for the indictment of David Rockefeller here on air.
[01:42:20.018 --> 01:42:25.841]  I'll call for the indictment of Governor Perry for going to Istanbul in violation of Federal Law Logan Act.
[01:42:26.656 --> 01:42:27.637]  Don't roll your eyes, cops.
[01:42:27.657 --> 01:42:28.718]  Stop Logan acting to Google.
[01:42:29.618 --> 01:42:32.100]  He went there, Bilderberg ribs were real, it's the Dallas Morning News.
[01:42:32.701 --> 01:42:39.306]  I remember seven years ago, the LA Times, not the LA Times, the New York Times said I was delusional and Bilderberg didn't exist.
[01:42:39.846 --> 01:42:41.387]  Yeah, it doesn't exist.
[01:42:41.607 --> 01:42:43.149]  You know, you guys are something else.
[01:42:43.509 --> 01:42:44.330]  That's all I can say.
[01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:45.791]  Let's talk to Paula.
[01:42:46.691 --> 01:42:48.893]  And Paula is calling from Florida.
[01:42:48.913 --> 01:42:49.353]  Last caller.
[01:42:49.373 --> 01:42:49.894]  Go ahead, Paula.
[01:42:50.394 --> 01:42:50.915]  Hi, Alex.
[01:42:51.335 --> 01:42:55.298]  What that gentleman said about you was very right about everything that you're doing.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.862]  And people need to listen to you, and more and more people are.
[01:42:58.423 --> 01:43:01.466]  And I mean, you've got the whole country behind you, but anyway... Well, I don't know about that.
[01:43:01.486 --> 01:43:04.830]  We've got millions of people that have woken up, and I'm only one soldier in this fight.
[01:43:05.150 --> 01:43:12.258]  Well, hey, you're a great soldier, but anyway, this thing about the genetic thing, the farmers are now saying they're not going to have anything to do with it.
[01:43:13.206 --> 01:43:15.647]  But they are all saying they don't want to happen.
[01:43:15.667 --> 01:43:16.128]  Exactly.
[01:43:16.628 --> 01:43:19.729]  But Bonsanto knew that was going to happen and so did the others that produced this.
[01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:28.894]  Then their pollen infects your plants, your plant shows any history of that, cross-pollinization, then they literally founded and run the St.
[01:43:28.934 --> 01:43:33.156]  Louis Federal Court that does all the genetic engineering cases and then everyone loses.
[01:43:33.777 --> 01:43:34.977]  So again, it's a rigged game.
[01:43:35.017 --> 01:43:35.878]  The dice are loaded.
[01:43:36.298 --> 01:43:38.719]  Everybody knows the dice are loaded.
[01:43:39.319 --> 01:43:40.420]  Who sings that song, Otta?
[01:43:42.035 --> 01:43:43.016]  Play that as bumper music.
[01:43:43.276 --> 01:43:45.638]  Folks, we are out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:46.939 --> 01:43:47.980]  I've got a weekday show course.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.882]  I'll be back here next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:43:49.922 --> 01:43:50.963]  I come in on Sundays and do this.
[01:43:51.304 --> 01:43:55.768]  I'm going to work tonight on my film, Endgame, because I know this is deadly serious what we're facing.
[01:43:56.108 --> 01:44:01.934]  I meant to get to all the news that we didn't get to, but I'd love to do it next week or something.
[01:44:01.954 --> 01:44:04.536]  You just can never cover it all, these types of subjects.
[01:44:04.577 --> 01:44:05.938]  I've got a Reuters article
[01:44:07.412 --> 01:44:08.493]  No, AP, excuse me.
[01:44:08.833 --> 01:44:10.515]  Congress looks to push U.S.
[01:44:10.615 --> 01:44:11.135]  tourism.
[01:44:11.516 --> 01:44:13.617]  Tourism has fallen massively.
[01:44:15.399 --> 01:44:16.320]  It has plummeted.
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:19.662]  I mean, the numbers are just off the charts.
[01:44:20.183 --> 01:44:22.565]  Tens of billions of dollars, 20-plus percent drop.
[01:44:24.077 --> 01:44:25.018]  3.7 million less visits.
[01:44:25.739 --> 01:44:25.979]  Why?
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:27.902]  Because they're sending questionnaires at the police state.
[01:44:28.323 --> 01:44:30.606]  I've got a reporter I sent to China, Paul Watson.
[01:44:30.626 --> 01:44:31.927]  He said, no police state.
[01:44:32.148 --> 01:44:33.690]  You know, if they want to grab you, they just come kill you.
[01:44:35.172 --> 01:44:37.114]  Everybody who comes here says it's unbelievable police state.
[01:44:37.395 --> 01:44:39.317]  See, we've been living in it, so we're used to it.
[01:44:39.597 --> 01:44:40.278]  God bless you all.
[01:44:40.298 --> 01:44:40.599]  Take care.
[01:44:42.515 --> 01:44:46.757]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.
[01:44:46.877 --> 01:44:49.678]  Now you can do even more to hear Genesis shows in your area.

[01:45:16.291 --> 01:45:19.353]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offered forward.
[01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:27.198]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:45:27.258 --> 01:45:30.801]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
