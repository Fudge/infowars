[00:00:00.858 --> 00:00:03.860]  You prepare yourself for a talk radio interview.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.941]  You're screaming like no other.
[00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:06.961]  Like no other.
[00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.302]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:08.922]  Hold on.
[00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.264]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:14.545]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:15.906 --> 00:00:17.467]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:20.669]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.511]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:40.565]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:42.727]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:43.167]  Welcome.
[00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:52.274]  Thank you so much for joining me all over the country and right here in Central Texas on our AM and FM affiliates, the Internet, Global, Shortwave, and Satellite.
[00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:54.296]  Thank you for tuning in.
[00:00:55.337 --> 00:00:59.000]  It is the 21st day of January, 2007.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.505]  Hard to believe the first month of the new year is already getting a bit long in the tooth.
[00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:07.347]  We have a very important transmission for you today.
[00:01:07.387 --> 00:01:14.533]  We'll have wide open tones as well on any issue you'd like to discuss concerning the news and developments on our planet today.
[00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:23.861]  The criminal, the witch, the socialist, the un-American piece of filth, Hillary Clinton, the liar,
[00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:30.733]  Has announced, as you know, over the weekend, Saturday morning, that she will be running for president.
[00:01:30.773 --> 00:01:44.339]  Now, I pulled up her statements two years ago, a year ago, and six months ago, and we're writing an article about this for PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com that will be up by tomorrow evening, where she lied
[00:01:44.998 --> 00:01:52.142]  And promised that she was not going to run for president and said that she had no intention to and was not going to.
[00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:59.285]  Now when the Clintons tell you something, you know it is the complete 180 degree polar opposite.
[00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:06.609]  And indeed it is the polar opposite in every single respect.
[00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.624]  But the field isn't any better on the Republican side.
[00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:17.631]  Newt Gingrich, who's been calling for an end to the First Amendment, a total domestic surveillance police state, and open borders.
[00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:21.815]  Newt Gingrich, who has been pushing for a North American Union.
[00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:27.481]  Newt Gingrich, the Council on Foreign Relations co-chairman, is just as bad.
[00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.845]  He is not a conservative, and he is a danger to this Republic.
[00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:36.002]  And we've got all the rest of them, Barack Obama, all of them.
[00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:46.012]  If they're being given national attention, and they're being pushed, and the media is telling you how good they are, you can believe they're in the hip pocket of the New World Order.
[00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:55.662]  That's the big global banks that own our Federal Reserve, and literally own our country, and are waging war against our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:08.262]  Now, you probably haven't heard the press give a lot of attention of what was announced now, I guess, nine, ten days ago, not this Friday, but the Friday before, when Congressman Ron Paul
[00:03:09.108 --> 00:03:12.790]  Announced that he is running for president in 2008.
[00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:21.634]  A Vietnam veteran, a medical doctor, the most conservative member of Congress with the most conservative voting record.
[00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:24.075]  He will openly talk about the World Government Program.
[00:03:24.315 --> 00:03:26.636]  He will openly talk about a cover-up on 9-11.
[00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:29.797]  I've interviewed him probably 50, 60 times over the years.
[00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:31.758]  I've had dinner with him several times.
[00:03:31.838 --> 00:03:33.179]  I know Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.180]  He is the best candidate.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.802]  I mean, he'd be a good candidate in 1776.
[00:03:37.142 --> 00:03:39.044]  He'd be a good candidate in 1800.
[00:03:39.484 --> 00:03:42.406]  I mean, this guy is founding father type material.
[00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:48.251]  A perfect voting record on the borders, on the Second Amendment, on everything.
[00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:49.832]  A real conservative.
[00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:52.114]  The liberals like him because he's anti-war.
[00:03:52.154 --> 00:03:54.296]  That is real liberals, real grassroots liberals.
[00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:55.997]  Conservatives like him.
[00:03:56.017 --> 00:03:57.899]  He's pro-gun, wants to control our borders.
[00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:02.943]  And the libertarians love him because he's really a libertarian and sprung from the libertarian ranks.
[00:04:03.802 --> 00:04:04.523]  I was out of town.
[00:04:04.563 --> 00:04:05.944]  I took a well-deserved break.
[00:04:05.964 --> 00:04:08.405]  It was great just to get out of Austin and the allergies.
[00:04:09.045 --> 00:04:09.966]  It was rejuvenating.
[00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:11.146]  I took a week-long vacation.
[00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.067]  I wasn't here last Sunday.
[00:04:12.107 --> 00:04:14.969]  I'm here now, back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.873]  I was unable to interview him last week, but my fill-in host, Jack Blood, did sit in.
[00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:23.774]  That was for a 20-minute interview.
[00:04:23.854 --> 00:04:25.755]  In the next few weeks, I'm going to have a full hour
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.942]  With the congressman on my syndicated radio show.
[00:04:28.982 --> 00:04:30.304]  In fact, that's my weekday one.
[00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:43.215]  I think I might just invite the congressman on this new Sunday syndicated transmission we're doing in a little marriage with Ennis and Genesis Communications here at the studios of News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:47.919]  So, I'm very excited about that and I'm going to give Ron Paul my full support.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.864]  The problem is the Democrats, which is my right as an American in the First Amendment,
[00:04:54.628 --> 00:05:01.831]  It's my right, but the Democrats, as was predicted, it wasn't hard to predict, the Democrats are calling for the Fairness Doctrine to be brought back.
[00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:03.771]  That's like calling the Patriot Act patriotic.
[00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:06.532]  You've got to love these Orwellian terms, the Fairness Doctrine.
[00:05:06.752 --> 00:05:07.733]  Totally unfair!
[00:05:08.173 --> 00:05:12.694]  Did you know until 1988, you couldn't have a talk radio show in the U.S.
[00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:14.595]  and mention anything about politics.
[00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:16.356]  You couldn't say you were pro-gun.
[00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:18.636]  You couldn't say you were against or for abortion.
[00:05:18.836 --> 00:05:22.218]  You couldn't say you were for missile defense or not for missile defense.
[00:05:22.298 --> 00:05:23.478]  And it got changed
[00:05:23.911 --> 00:05:28.294]  And a whole industry and free speech burgeoned out of that.
[00:05:28.334 --> 00:05:33.858]  They're openly talking about bringing back the Fairness Doctrine, but not just to talk radio.
[00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:34.638]  Oh no!
[00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:36.039]  Oh no!
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.824]  I have here before me bloggers who criticize government may face prison time.
[00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:52.150]  I have the actual subsections of the bill that has now, believe it or not, already passed out of the House and gone into the Senate.
[00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.691]  I mean, this is happening
[00:05:54.159 --> 00:06:04.264]  Right now, and I have the subsection of the legislation here in front of me, we'll be covering that for you that will not allow you to have political views on the internet.
[00:06:04.724 --> 00:06:07.265]  And by the way, how many years is that?
[00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:08.486]  10, 12, and 7?
[00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:16.669]  We're talking about 17, 18 years since the Fairness Doctrine was overturned.
[00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.790]  Before that,
[00:06:18.652 --> 00:06:21.734]  Because they overturned it in 1988 and didn't go into effect until 1989.
[00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:33.384]  Before that, you didn't have free speech in this country in many respects, when it came to print media, when it came to broadcast media, and now they're trying to bring it back to the internet as well.
[00:06:33.404 --> 00:06:37.707]  They're doing the same thing in England, the same thing on the continent, in Europe.
[00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:43.072]  It is just absolutely incredible.
[00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:46.074]  So, again, 19 years ago this changed.
[00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:47.615]  18 years ago it went into effect.
[00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:49.437]  Some semblance of the First Amendment.
[00:06:49.477 --> 00:06:51.018]  That's free speech, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:58.223]  And now they're having a frontal assault on it, and Bush is talking about signing it!
[00:06:59.364 --> 00:07:02.166]  Remember Bush signed campaign finance reform.
[00:07:03.174 --> 00:07:04.435]  There's no reform about it.
[00:07:04.455 --> 00:07:11.841]  It doubled the money corporations could give, but then restricted the money that American citizens individually could give.
[00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:16.124]  So it actually restricted the people and empowered multinational corporations.
[00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:20.928]  There are two full-time lobbyists for each member of Congress.
[00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:24.791]  There is a full-time paid lobbyist plus
[00:07:25.748 --> 00:07:33.614]  For every single member of a state legislature in this country, and more than half of them are foreign registered lobbyists.
[00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:34.675]  Okay?
[00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:44.082]  So foreign governments and foreign corporations can lobby our government, but they're doing everything they can so the American people can't do it.
[00:07:45.023 --> 00:07:46.104]  Now let me tell you something.
[00:07:46.124 --> 00:07:54.430]  When they passed that campaign finance reform bill, it stated that I, and any other talk show host or any other website operator or news site or blogger,
[00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:58.970]  Shea couldn't interview the head of the NRA six weeks before an election.
[00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.651]  You know what we did?
[00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:04.394]  We said, you can take a hike and you can go right off the nearest cliff if you feel like.
[00:08:04.434 --> 00:08:06.676]  You can go fly a kite, jump in the lake, whatever you want to do.
[00:08:06.896 --> 00:08:08.798]  We're ignoring this, and we did ignore it.
[00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:10.039]  Everyone ignored it!
[00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:11.901]  And they were unable to implement it.
[00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:14.403]  Okay, I'll interview whoever I want.
[00:08:14.423 --> 00:08:18.666]  If I want to interview Ralph Nader right before the election, I didn't support him for president, but I interviewed him.
[00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:19.647]  I'm gonna do it!
[00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:23.601]  And if I want to interview Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America, I'm going to do it!
[00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:25.722]  And let me tell you something else I'm going to do.
[00:08:25.742 --> 00:08:34.546]  I'm going to write whatever I want on the internet, I'm going to say whatever I want, and I don't care, you know, damn the torpedoes, we're going full steam ahead.
[00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:40.769]  This is the United States of America, and Hillary Clinton, or George Bush, or any, and they're all in business together.
[00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.172]  Don't delude yourselves, you know, don't be fooled by that dog and pony show.
[00:08:45.672 --> 00:08:47.113]  It is the elite against the people.
[00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:47.633]  By the way,
[00:08:48.726 --> 00:08:53.992]  Two separate Rupert Murdoch newspapers today have endorsed Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:54.793 --> 00:09:04.385]  Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes, the phony conservative kingmakers, they're there to control and manipulate the conservative movement and make sure it never helps take this country back.
[00:09:06.025 --> 00:09:22.718]  It came out three years ago that every week he has a two to four hour meeting with her, dinner with her, Ailes is there, they go on vacation together, he is pushing her for Senate, pushing her for President, but trying to keep it covert, and he thinks we're dumb, like we don't know the New York Post is owned by Murdoch, like we don't know the Times of London's owned by him.
[00:09:22.898 --> 00:09:26.241]  I got both of them right here in my hand, endorsing this witch!
[00:09:26.561 --> 00:09:27.522]  This liar!
[00:09:28.663 --> 00:09:29.543]  Unbelievable!
[00:09:29.864 --> 00:09:33.867]  We're onto you, phony conservatives, and we're gonna bring you down!
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.581]  Up with Ron Paul!
[00:09:35.721 --> 00:09:36.962]  Down with Hillary Clinton!
[00:09:37.162 --> 00:09:40.024]  Down with Newt Gingrich and all the rest of you open borders traitors!
[00:09:40.264 --> 00:09:41.125]  We'll be right back!
[00:09:41.365 --> 00:09:42.446]  I'm Alex Jones!
[00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:04.390]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:11.434]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[00:10:11.894 --> 00:10:25.240]  For example, did you know that LIV52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.982]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:37.858]  Including those for cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, cirrhosis, and hepatitis, among others, is extremely well documented.

[00:11:00.695 --> 00:11:04.358]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:10.184]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:11:10.644 --> 00:11:11.705]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[00:11:11.765 --> 00:11:15.789]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:11:16.451 --> 00:11:29.797]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:35.579]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:41.762]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:11:42.522 --> 00:11:44.305]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:48.529]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:49.571]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:51.793]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:51.873]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:06.976]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:12:07.336 --> 00:12:09.277]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:12:09.637 --> 00:12:17.300]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:25.023]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:28.344]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:12:28.745 --> 00:12:31.066]  A White House probe to disseminate fake news.
[00:12:31.486 --> 00:12:32.306]  NSA spying.
[00:12:32.805 --> 00:12:36.847]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:40.648]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:43.049]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:47.290]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:14:10.612 --> 00:14:13.514]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.

[00:14:28.643 --> 00:14:32.325]  Orbs, locally in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:34.627]  Joel, Todd, Jeff, many others.
[00:14:35.147 --> 00:14:36.928]  We'll get into your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:39.490]  I've got a lot here in front of me, a lot on my plate.
[00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:53.124]  There's this disgusting article out of the Times of London, there's another one out of the New York Post, about how wonderful Hillary is, and how good she is, and how she's a wonderful person, how we all need to vote for her.
[00:14:54.345 --> 00:15:00.187]  Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch's having campaign contribution events, raising her millions of dollars.
[00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:04.649]  I mean, the elite are really trying to position Hillary, and they're trying to...
[00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:06.038]  Well, she's a woman!
[00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:07.519]  It's like Nancy Pelosi!
[00:15:07.979 --> 00:15:09.140]  Another traitor to America.
[00:15:09.601 --> 00:15:11.542]  Oh, since it's a woman, you can't be against her!
[00:15:12.463 --> 00:15:18.968]  Oh, and Bill Richardson has now announced the New Mexico governor, who was involved in all the Clinton cover-ups.
[00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:21.490]  It's incredible.
[00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.431]  Meanwhile, Bush Sr.
[00:15:22.451 --> 00:15:28.076]  vacations with the Clintons and calls Clinton his surrogate son, and Hillary wants to expand the war.
[00:15:28.856 --> 00:15:30.077]  Hillary's for the Patriot Act.
[00:15:30.117 --> 00:15:31.599]  She voted for the domestic
[00:15:33.249 --> 00:15:34.490]  Security Enhancement Act.
[00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.433]  She voted for all of this legislation that has nothing to do with security and everything with a police stake.
[00:15:39.733 --> 00:15:40.274]  It's simple.
[00:15:40.954 --> 00:15:44.096]  The elite have circled the wagons against the people.
[00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:46.197]  It's happened all throughout history.
[00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:56.603]  They know we're waking up to their corruption, and they're trying to do everything they can to restrict our freedoms, restrict our free speech, while at the same time of the North American Union busting open our borders.
[00:15:56.943 --> 00:16:00.946]  And Bush right now, the Democratic-controlled Congress, is trying to pass
[00:16:01.924 --> 00:16:06.747]  The amnesty plan that they have repackaged as a guest worker program.
[00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:16.052]  As if 30 million, and that's the real number, illegal aliens in this country isn't enough to bring down the wages and bring down the sovereignty of this country.
[00:16:16.112 --> 00:16:24.877]  Also, they love all the illegal aliens becoming citizens because they have no history of freedom, and they'll pull the lever in the voting booth for gun control, socialism, you name it.
[00:16:25.868 --> 00:16:32.611]  But let me right now get into the First Amendment attacking issue that I discussed as a story that we put together up on InfoWars.net.
[00:16:32.631 --> 00:16:37.994]  But if you go read the article, again, every statement we make is sourced and linked to the legislation.
[00:16:38.254 --> 00:16:39.234]  Let me read some of this.
[00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:42.896]  Bloggers who criticize government may face prison.
[00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:47.178]  Bill would allow rounding up and imprisoning of non-registered political writers.
[00:16:48.973 --> 00:16:55.540]  And it goes on to say, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it was some new restriction on free speech in Communist China, but it isn't.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.321]  The U.S.
[00:16:56.361 --> 00:17:04.670]  government wants to force bloggers and online grassroots activists to register and regularly report their activities to Congress and be under campaign finance laws.
[00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:05.471]  Let me go back.
[00:17:34.139 --> 00:17:45.948]  Even bloggers who communicate to 500 or more members of the public or policy matters to register and report quarterly to Congress the same as the big K Street lobbyist.
[00:17:46.289 --> 00:17:53.895]  Section 220 would amend existing lobbying reporting law by creating the most expansive intrusion on First Amendment rights ever.
[00:17:53.915 --> 00:17:59.379]  For the first time in history, critics of Congress will need to register and report with Congress itself.
[00:17:59.952 --> 00:18:03.753]  And it goes on to talk about the actual wording and the laws that we'll be under.
[00:18:04.013 --> 00:18:05.834]  That's current lobbying laws.
[00:18:06.114 --> 00:18:13.816]  So now, all of your free speech on the internet, and there also, there's an accompanying section on Talk Radio, of course, will have to be registered.
[00:18:14.117 --> 00:18:18.398]  If I say I don't like Hillary Clinton, oh, I've been political now!
[00:18:19.758 --> 00:18:21.739]  This is all political sleight of hand.
[00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:23.120]  Take churches 50 years ago.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:28.903]  Did you know churches 50 years ago didn't have 501c3 and 501c4 tax exemptions?
[00:18:28.963 --> 00:18:36.827]  You just... First Amendment says, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:18:37.187 --> 00:18:38.568]  Congress shall make no law!
[00:18:38.648 --> 00:18:39.408]  Has no power!
[00:18:39.748 --> 00:18:41.910]  But they just told churches, oh, it's a new regulation.
[00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.370]  Just fill out these forms.
[00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:43.951]  It's free.
[00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:44.471]  Send them in.
[00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:45.591]  You get your tax exemption.
[00:18:46.252 --> 00:18:48.333]  Churches have always had it since the founding of this country.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.061]  But it was all just sleight of hand.
[00:18:51.581 --> 00:18:52.262]  It wasn't even a law.
[00:18:52.302 --> 00:18:53.042]  It was color law.
[00:18:53.062 --> 00:19:00.245]  Then they signed onto a contract with that tax exemption form and volunteered into the system.
[00:19:00.725 --> 00:19:02.046]  So it was a contract.
[00:19:02.086 --> 00:19:06.248]  They signed a civil contract with the state.
[00:19:07.034 --> 00:19:16.364]  And then now, I've had friends that go to Baptist churches, bring me back letters they give them saying, don't talk about politics in the pews, don't talk about it in Sunday school, don't talk about it at church-sponsored dinners at steakhouses.
[00:19:17.045 --> 00:19:18.466]  Don't talk about who you're for!
[00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:20.168]  We could lose our exemption!
[00:19:21.129 --> 00:19:24.333]  I mean, now they're saying preachers don't have any free speech, and then the
[00:19:25.347 --> 00:19:27.488]  The parishioners don't have any free speech.
[00:19:27.688 --> 00:19:28.548]  It's the same thing with this.
[00:19:28.588 --> 00:19:30.789]  They just go, oh, we're just telling you to register.
[00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:35.070]  We're telling you that you can't interview people six weeks before an election.
[00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.271]  Nothing political anymore.
[00:19:36.311 --> 00:19:39.612]  They just tell you and we just go along with it.
[00:19:41.673 --> 00:19:43.093]  It's unbelievable.
[00:19:43.213 --> 00:19:44.714]  Of course we have free speech.
[00:19:44.774 --> 00:19:48.995]  Of course I can get on talk radio and talk about the people I support or the people I don't support.
[00:19:49.255 --> 00:19:52.576]  You can call in and talk about what you believe and what you think.
[00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:54.837]  It's so un-American.
[00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.051]  And both political parties are supporting this legislation.
[00:19:59.471 --> 00:20:00.131]  Why is that?
[00:20:00.212 --> 00:20:18.157]  Because with all the money that the telecommunications companies spent in 2006, in 2006 the Associated Press reported that over 150 million dollars was spent by the big telecommunications companies, much of which are global by the way, aren't even US-based,
[00:20:18.826 --> 00:20:26.829]  In Congress, just federally, they're also lobbying at the state level to pass this new telecommunications package.
[00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.371]  Remember the end of net neutrality, the end of net freedom?
[00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:36.433]  And it failed by a couple votes because of our gargantuan grassroots resistance.
[00:20:37.031 --> 00:20:42.193]  They want to label your website, your blog, your MySpace account, everything you do.
[00:20:42.413 --> 00:20:46.735]  And see, they're not going to be able to shut it down individually, so they're going to go after ISPs, the Internet Service Providers.
[00:20:46.955 --> 00:21:01.581]  They're going to go after the radio stations, the radio networks, and they're going to have the executives of those companies implement this over the people that work in the talk radio industry and over people who have blogs and websites on a server at a telecommunications company.
[00:21:02.282 --> 00:21:03.983]  That's how they bring you this stuff.
[00:21:04.043 --> 00:21:07.366]  It isn't even laws, it's just all mumbo-jumbo.
[00:21:08.446 --> 00:21:15.852]  But then they will loop you into a law under campaign finance reform and add you into it, and that's where the criminal penalties come in.
[00:21:17.173 --> 00:21:20.255]  And you try to explain this to the average person, they just don't even have a clue.
[00:21:20.315 --> 00:21:24.558]  The basic question for everyone out there is, are you going to let them take your power away?
[00:21:25.942 --> 00:21:33.269]  To, in a yearly period, if you communicate with over 500 people on the internet, you are now a registered lobbyist.
[00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:39.314]  You have to register with them, and that's just the start, and more and more regulations will get piled on on top of this.
[00:21:39.755 --> 00:21:40.015]  No!
[00:21:40.575 --> 00:21:42.497]  I'm not going to go along with it, I'm not going to be part of it.
[00:21:42.657 --> 00:21:45.700]  Here's an analogy, here's something analogous to that locally.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.205]  This morning I wanted to take my wife and children down and walk on the Greenbelt because the Barton Creek's got some water in it.
[00:21:51.986 --> 00:21:52.626]  I drove down there.
[00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:55.267]  Anytime it rains, any amount, they shut it all down.
[00:21:55.307 --> 00:21:56.267]  It's what control freaks do.
[00:21:56.307 --> 00:21:59.227]  It's to train you that the state and the government is in control of everything.
[00:22:00.508 --> 00:22:02.468]  There were probably 60 cars there.
[00:22:03.928 --> 00:22:05.209]  No one was following it.
[00:22:05.369 --> 00:22:06.629]  Families, you name it.
[00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:10.030]  Groups of children out on some type of field trip.
[00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:16.171]  There were hundreds of people down there, but the place we parked, 50, 60 cars, everybody just climbed the fence and went right in.
[00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:17.531]  It's the same thing.
[00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:21.956]  It's what the government's saying, and they did say, black people aren't human beings, they're slaves.
[00:22:22.336 --> 00:22:25.118]  Blacks finally said, no, I'm a human being, and I'm not your slave.
[00:22:25.378 --> 00:22:26.379]  It's natural law.
[00:22:26.439 --> 00:22:27.420]  It's God-given rights.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.982]  Okay, we'll use the green belts if we want to.
[00:22:30.162 --> 00:22:31.743]  We'll have free speech if we want to.
[00:22:31.763 --> 00:22:35.606]  You can try to surveil us and control us and manipulate us, it isn't going to work.
[00:22:35.886 --> 00:22:39.029]  We'll come back, go right to your calls, get into a bunch of other news.
[00:22:39.089 --> 00:22:40.370]  I got tons of stuff.
[00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.093]  They're talking about a huge strike, even an invasion of Iran.
[00:22:44.353 --> 00:22:45.494]  We'll give you the details of that.
[00:22:53.015 --> 00:23:06.287]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[00:23:06.647 --> 00:23:09.629]  Since that time I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.893]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with building blocks for good health.
[00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:18.357]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[00:23:18.957 --> 00:23:23.461]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[00:23:24.542 --> 00:23:28.506]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery, and Jim said no.
[00:23:28.986 --> 00:23:33.290]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others, but never been surpassed.
[00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.213]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops, 4-ounce bottle, for only $79.99.
[00:23:37.814 --> 00:23:42.698]  Call the Power Hour at 877-817-9829.
[00:23:42.718 --> 00:23:43.759]  877-817-9829.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.703]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula?
[00:23:47.963 --> 00:23:50.185]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[00:23:50.225 --> 00:23:50.485]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:53.267]  Now you can really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[00:24:00.775 --> 00:24:03.160]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.745]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:24:05.805 --> 00:24:10.494]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:24:11.155 --> 00:24:17.980]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:31.389]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:24:31.849 --> 00:24:35.832]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:24:36.292 --> 00:24:40.275]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[00:24:40.835 --> 00:24:46.360]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.742]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[00:24:50.142 --> 00:24:51.363]  That's Wristease.
[00:24:51.784 --> 00:24:56.748]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[00:24:56.908 --> 00:24:59.530]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:25:00.479 --> 00:25:02.540]  Imagine living truly debt-free.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.741]  No credit card debt, no car payments, no mortgage.
[00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:07.902]  Just your daily living expenses.
[00:25:08.162 --> 00:25:11.063]  And you can do this with just the money you already make.
[00:25:11.344 --> 00:25:15.285]  I'm John Commuta, creator of the Transforming Debt Into Wealth program.
[00:25:15.525 --> 00:25:19.467]  I did it and so have nearly a half million others using my proven system.
[00:25:19.627 --> 00:25:21.948]  I'm completely debt-free now thanks to John Commuta.
[00:25:22.168 --> 00:25:26.951]  I will be able to pay off my house in approximately two and a half years on a 30-year mortgage.
[00:25:27.452 --> 00:25:29.553]  It works no matter how much debt you have.
[00:25:29.813 --> 00:25:32.975]  My system doesn't consolidate your debt, it eliminates it.
[00:25:33.235 --> 00:25:36.458]  It's easy, risk-free, and works with any income level.
[00:25:36.718 --> 00:25:40.760]  And once we got on the system, we were able to eliminate about 90% of our debt.
[00:25:41.141 --> 00:25:44.823]  I never have to worry about who's calling me or who's knocking on my door.
[00:25:44.963 --> 00:25:49.066]  Call now and I'll rush you a free tape that will show you the power of my proven system.
[00:25:50.879 --> 00:25:51.039]  1-800-400-8498.
[00:25:51.059 --> 00:25:51.119]  1-800-400-8498.
[00:25:51.199 --> 00:25:51.399]  That's 1-800-400-8498.
[00:25:51.479 --> 00:25:54.181]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:25:54.201 --> 00:25:55.861]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:10.731]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:15.917]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:26:16.298 --> 00:26:21.665]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:26:21.985 --> 00:26:24.949]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:26:25.129 --> 00:26:25.689]  We're good to go.
[00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:53.983]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:26:54.003 --> 00:26:54.544]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:26:54.604 --> 00:26:56.025]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:56.045 --> 00:26:57.866]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:26:57.946 --> 00:27:00.669]  At 6, on News Radio 590, KLVJ.
[00:27:00.729 --> 00:27:04.512]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:18.982 --> 00:27:20.023]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:27:36.016 --> 00:27:37.558]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:38.338 --> 00:27:43.583]  We're going to plunge into your phone calls now and then I will get into several really important
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:51.142]  Reports here concerning the First Amendment, not just the attack on bloggers, the internet, any free speech, having to register as a lobbyist.
[00:27:52.482 --> 00:27:57.603]  New York Court, FBI might have violated First Amendment in efforts to take down conspiracy film.
[00:27:58.123 --> 00:28:01.704]  This isn't from PrisonPlanet.com, it's from the Associated Press.
[00:28:01.824 --> 00:28:08.566]  Yes, they don't even like conspiracy documentaries about concentration camps and martial law.
[00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:10.386]  So we'll be going into that.
[00:28:10.546 --> 00:28:13.287]  Also, US plans invasion, broad attack,
[00:28:13.917 --> 00:28:14.678]  on Iran.
[00:28:14.698 --> 00:28:17.880]  This is all over the foreign press from England to Japan.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.322]  The particular report I have is out of the Korea Times.
[00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:21.042]  U.S.
[00:28:21.102 --> 00:28:24.785]  plans invasion, broad attack on Iran.
[00:28:24.945 --> 00:28:36.233]  A lot broader than what you've been hearing about these precision strikes using a combination of conventional bunker busters and low-yield nuclear warheads.
[00:28:36.914 --> 00:28:41.057]  So I will be breaking that down as well for you.
[00:28:42.202 --> 00:28:45.663]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the phone calls.
[00:28:45.983 --> 00:28:48.584]  Let's talk to Mark in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:28:48.864 --> 00:28:49.525]  You're on the air.
[00:28:49.625 --> 00:28:50.625]  Worldwide welcome.
[00:28:51.225 --> 00:28:51.785]  Hey, Alex.
[00:28:51.805 --> 00:28:52.266]  How are you doing?
[00:28:52.306 --> 00:28:52.666]  Good, sir.
[00:28:53.466 --> 00:28:54.906]  It's a pleasure to speak with you.
[00:28:54.926 --> 00:29:02.629]  Yeah, I just wanted to... I know there's so many different important stories, Alex, and I get a headache from having to keep up with all this stuff that's going on.
[00:29:02.709 --> 00:29:03.469]  Oh, I'm going to stop you.
[00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:05.050]  I'm going to stop you, Mark, and then I'm going to let you talk.
[00:29:05.683 --> 00:29:16.010]  I literally got back from vacation yesterday afternoon, and literally today, I was sitting there in front of my computer for like three hours before I drove down to the studio, and I almost was like spinning.
[00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:17.251]  I was like, what do I cover?
[00:29:17.471 --> 00:29:18.191]  There's so much!
[00:29:18.231 --> 00:29:18.652]  How do I?
[00:29:18.812 --> 00:29:22.934]  Because I can't just mention a story, I have to get into some detail, so there's no way to cover it all.
[00:29:22.974 --> 00:29:23.555]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:29:23.835 --> 00:29:26.537]  Yeah, very diffused range of issues.
[00:29:26.697 --> 00:29:34.422]  Well, there's so much proof of just the ongoing criminal program by the private interests that own our country now to totally enslave us and rob the hell out of us.
[00:29:35.018 --> 00:29:36.379]  The government's criminal!
[00:29:36.439 --> 00:29:37.800]  It's just out-of-control criminal!
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:38.621]  Yes.
[00:29:39.181 --> 00:29:50.089]  Anyway, what I wanted to talk about, and not that I agree with all those positions anymore, I've kind of changed my position on certain things, i.e.
[00:29:50.469 --> 00:29:55.553]  border security and that sort of thing, because I'd be concerned the government might use that to, like, trap us in.
[00:29:55.913 --> 00:30:00.156]  But I was on Pat Buchanan's Steering Committee for his 2000 campaign, and I'll never forget
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:06.506]  You know, we got, like, very little traction and the media wouldn't cover our campaign and stuff like that.
[00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:14.153]  And the usual refrain, the standard refrain coming from the media was, well, we cover the candidates that the people want to see.
[00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:22.381]  And you know, that's so circular, Alex, because nobody knows who's running for office unless the media tells them about it to begin with.
[00:30:22.521 --> 00:30:24.002]  And so this is what I wanted to get into.
[00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:24.923]  Well, let me just comment on that.
[00:30:24.983 --> 00:30:25.964]  It's a feedback loop.
[00:30:26.542 --> 00:30:27.803]  They decide who to hype.
[00:30:27.823 --> 00:30:35.789]  I mean, Barack Obama, some freshman senator, you know, really no credibility or background, and they hype him like it's the second coming of Jesus.
[00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:37.090]  Same thing with Hillary.
[00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.792]  Newt Gingrich, total slimeball.
[00:30:40.492 --> 00:30:45.496]  And this is what so upsets me, and I'm so sad, because here we have Ron Paul, very intelligent man.
[00:30:45.516 --> 00:30:46.897]  You know, he's an M.D.
[00:30:48.017 --> 00:30:51.720]  I mean, yeah, the most conservative voting... I mean, that guy knows the Constitution.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.302]  He actually votes in favor of the Constitution.
[00:30:54.795 --> 00:30:55.776]  And nobody knows who he is.
[00:30:55.856 --> 00:30:58.458]  In fact, this kind of crystallizes this whole situation.
[00:30:59.238 --> 00:31:02.261]  My stepdad has always been apolitical.
[00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:03.702]  He's never cared about politics.
[00:31:03.722 --> 00:31:09.766]  All of a sudden he asked me, you know, how would I go about getting involved with the Barack Obama campaign?
[00:31:10.186 --> 00:31:11.908]  I'm like, look, I'm not going to tell you that.
[00:31:12.188 --> 00:31:13.989]  I'm going to be helping out Ron Paul's campaign.
[00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.630]  He's like, who?
[00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.151]  I know, it's amazing.
[00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:18.520]  It's so frustrating, but listen.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.501]  I'm supporting Ron Paul's campaign.
[00:31:21.102 --> 00:31:25.005]  Just getting him into Republican debates will be a great platform to educate the public.
[00:31:25.505 --> 00:31:27.627]  The Republican Party has targeted him.
[00:31:28.327 --> 00:31:33.831]  Tom DeLay helped rewrite his district in an attempt to defeat him, because he's a conservative and they're not.
[00:31:34.371 --> 00:31:40.616]  And they don't like someone showing the fact that they're acting like conservatives, wolves in sheep's clothing, rhinos, Republican in name only.
[00:31:41.329 --> 00:31:48.751]  And even though they rewrote his district into a Democratic area, he then won by, what, 66% of the vote at this last midterm election.
[00:31:49.512 --> 00:31:55.514]  So he is well-known in conservative circles, and he has a good chance of getting a nomination.
[00:31:55.534 --> 00:32:00.415]  I think if he goes and camps out in New Hampshire, if he can win New Hampshire, Ron Paul can really get in there.
[00:32:00.435 --> 00:32:02.176]  But I think overall it's a diversion.
[00:32:02.796 --> 00:32:07.597]  That is, we get 55-60% turnouts for presidential elections.
[00:32:08.198 --> 00:32:09.038]  Why don't we get that?
[00:32:09.665 --> 00:32:11.746]  Why is it 8% nationally on average?
[00:32:11.866 --> 00:32:15.227]  Austin has the same average as the nation.
[00:32:15.247 --> 00:32:15.227]  8%?
[00:32:15.947 --> 00:32:16.247]  Why?
[00:32:16.347 --> 00:32:17.268]  Why do we have 8%?
[00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:19.368]  That's where we can really take over.
[00:32:19.408 --> 00:32:20.609]  That's where we can have an effect.
[00:32:20.929 --> 00:32:24.230]  That's where we can circumvent the big lobbyists and all their money.
[00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.791]  I mean, the big guns are on Washington.
[00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:26.791]  They pretty much conquered it.
[00:32:27.211 --> 00:32:29.032]  Why aren't we focusing more on the locals?
[00:32:29.052 --> 00:32:33.473]  Because again, the media doesn't give attention like it should to the local races.
[00:32:33.913 --> 00:32:35.774]  Or they give it to the local good old boys.
[00:32:36.034 --> 00:32:37.034]  The local kingmakers.
[00:32:37.775 --> 00:32:38.355]  Let's go ahead
[00:32:39.048 --> 00:32:42.951]  And I'll take a call here from George in Florida.
[00:32:43.011 --> 00:32:44.011]  George, thanks for holding.
[00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:44.632]  You're on the air.
[00:32:45.632 --> 00:32:47.894]  Well, I've missed you, Alex, all week.
[00:32:48.234 --> 00:32:48.994]  Well, I'm back.
[00:32:49.595 --> 00:32:55.659]  Well, anyway, you know, I started going to Republican Party's meetings, starting to sell Ron Paul.
[00:32:55.759 --> 00:33:06.746]  I mean, I was one of those people who was getting ready to change Republican and go Constitutionalist or Libertarian, but when Ron Paul threw his hat in the ring, I said, all right, I'm going to stay in the GOP for two more years.
[00:33:07.608 --> 00:33:16.134]  But I found out just going to some of these local party meetings and events that the people in the base are alienated from the leadership.
[00:33:16.254 --> 00:33:19.817]  Oh, hey, listen, listen, listen, listen.
[00:33:19.837 --> 00:33:32.946]  84% in two separate national scientific polls, Mason Dixon and Angus Reid, 84% right before the last election a few months ago, 84% give the entire Congress a bad approval rating.
[00:33:33.266 --> 00:33:33.606]  Okay?
[00:33:33.807 --> 00:33:36.148]  Dick Cheney only has a 12% approval rating.
[00:33:36.388 --> 00:33:36.629]  Okay?
[00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:41.692]  Conservatives know the Republican Party is a bunch of New World Order elitists.
[00:33:41.752 --> 00:33:48.718]  Now, you've got the diehards out there that are Republicans who aren't conservatives, and they're still going to support it because they hate Democrats so much.
[00:33:49.218 --> 00:33:57.124]  But we can show the American people that it's two parties teamed up together against the American people, and we can get Ron Paul elected.
[00:33:57.164 --> 00:33:57.765]  I'm telling you!
[00:33:59.066 --> 00:34:05.511]  Well, what really broke the new straw on the camel's back was when they elected Mel Martinez to head the RNC.
[00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:12.394]  Well, I mean, look, look, how many Republican governors are anti-Second Amendment, anti-gun, anti-self-defense?
[00:34:13.762 --> 00:34:14.943]  Who are for victim disarmament.
[00:34:15.163 --> 00:34:19.967]  How many Republicans, almost all of the leadership, are for total open borders, New World Order?
[00:34:19.987 --> 00:34:21.649]  I mean, even Lou Dobbs will tell you that now.
[00:34:22.009 --> 00:34:22.830]  So I'm telling you.
[00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.152]  But it's got to be a multi-pronged effect.
[00:34:25.172 --> 00:34:27.774]  You've got to try to educate the public about the Global Crime Syndicate.
[00:34:28.194 --> 00:34:29.495]  Continue that education process.
[00:34:29.515 --> 00:34:30.636]  They're now willing to wake up.
[00:34:30.656 --> 00:34:31.978]  They now know we've been telling them the truth.
[00:34:32.578 --> 00:34:35.941]  How many people out there heard me 12 years ago talk about the New World Order?
[00:34:36.121 --> 00:34:36.802]  You didn't believe me?
[00:34:36.842 --> 00:34:37.623]  Now you see it on CNN.
[00:34:38.383 --> 00:34:38.683]  Okay?
[00:34:38.923 --> 00:34:41.464]  How many people did I... I broke all this down.
[00:34:41.484 --> 00:34:43.265]  I told you they'd use terrorism to take our liberties.
[00:34:43.705 --> 00:34:44.806]  I was reading their own handbooks.
[00:34:45.426 --> 00:35:06.094]  Listen, the elitists are so arrogant that every year their big think tanks, Rand Corporation, Council on Foreign Relations think tank, a bunch of other big think tanks, hell, the Naval War College, the top, the head of the Naval War College, Professor Thomas Barnett,
[00:35:07.649 --> 00:35:08.850]  Went on C-SPAN.
[00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.212]  I have the little creature on video.
[00:35:11.352 --> 00:35:18.957]  I've played clips of it, saying, the military works for the New World Order, the military works for the global government, we work for Wall Street.
[00:35:19.798 --> 00:35:30.065]  I mean, they don't even mince words, but they know that only, I guess, in the past, weirdos, in quotes, like Alex Jones, watch C-SPAN, read Rand Corporation documents.
[00:35:30.945 --> 00:35:31.285]  Okay?
[00:35:31.685 --> 00:35:33.226]  That's how I knew all this stuff.
[00:35:33.686 --> 00:35:34.526]  I know how to read.
[00:35:34.586 --> 00:35:35.266]  It isn't hard.
[00:35:35.526 --> 00:35:42.868]  I mean, hell, folks, you can go buy British and German prime ministers and chancellors' autobiographies, American presidents' biographies.
[00:35:43.948 --> 00:35:47.809]  Because they know only a select few, inside the loop, read that stuff.
[00:35:48.729 --> 00:35:52.029]  And, I mean, it's all world government this, world government that.
[00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.330]  I mean, it's just so frustrating.
[00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.590]  Let me boil it down for you.
[00:35:58.171 --> 00:35:59.151]  I've never liked bullies.
[00:36:00.054 --> 00:36:01.095]  I've never liked scammers.
[00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:02.116]  I've never liked con artists.
[00:36:02.236 --> 00:36:04.138]  I always rooted for the guy in the white hat.
[00:36:04.178 --> 00:36:06.420]  You know, I didn't like the guys in the black hats and the westerns.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.961]  I'm a sap, folks.
[00:36:08.762 --> 00:36:11.805]  You know, I mean, last night, this is going to be a weird analogy, but I'm going to tell it.
[00:36:12.846 --> 00:36:14.527]  I got home, we had the dog sitter there.
[00:36:14.587 --> 00:36:15.648]  My dogs were real happy to see me.
[00:36:15.688 --> 00:36:18.731]  I got the food out, was feeding my dogs, and I was sitting there watching my dogs eat.
[00:36:19.792 --> 00:36:20.793]  And I just felt good.
[00:36:21.073 --> 00:36:22.575]  I was like, I want to take care of my dogs.
[00:36:22.635 --> 00:36:23.616]  I like taking care of things.
[00:36:23.656 --> 00:36:24.417]  I like being nice.
[00:36:24.497 --> 00:36:25.838]  I like, you know, I'm a softie.
[00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:28.180]  And you're going, what does that mean?
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.581]  My point is, I'm a nice guy.
[00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:30.622]  Most of you are nice people.
[00:36:32.244 --> 00:36:35.607]  You know, but I take that instinct of wanting to be nice to a puppy dog further.
[00:36:35.728 --> 00:36:36.689]  I want to help the people.
[00:36:37.009 --> 00:36:38.490]  I want to warn you about corruption.
[00:36:38.811 --> 00:36:43.836]  There's a whole other world out there, a real world out there, that the average person isn't even aware of.
[00:36:44.196 --> 00:36:45.117]  You're being scammed.
[00:36:45.177 --> 00:36:45.938]  I want to warn you.

[00:38:01.443 --> 00:38:02.264]  Come on, Bill.
[00:38:02.484 --> 00:38:04.344]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[00:38:04.525 --> 00:38:07.726]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[00:38:08.046 --> 00:38:08.606]  What did you do?
[00:38:08.726 --> 00:38:09.547]  Rob Bill Gates?
[00:38:09.647 --> 00:38:10.407]  No, John.
[00:38:10.467 --> 00:38:11.627]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:38:11.928 --> 00:38:17.510]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:24.092]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:38:24.433 --> 00:38:26.673]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:38:26.934 --> 00:38:28.254]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[00:38:30.635 --> 00:38:31.036]  Whoa!
[00:38:31.436 --> 00:38:32.657]  What was that website again?
[00:38:32.737 --> 00:38:36.260]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:36.561 --> 00:38:37.682]  Now write this down, John.
[00:38:37.822 --> 00:38:42.186]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:38:42.306 --> 00:38:42.906]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:38:43.186 --> 00:38:44.388]  I'm going there right now.
[00:38:44.828 --> 00:38:45.509]  Check, please.
[00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:48.751]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[00:38:49.232 --> 00:38:49.832]  Sure, John.
[00:38:50.053 --> 00:38:54.457]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:54.757 --> 00:38:56.458]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:38:56.619 --> 00:38:56.879]  Deal.
[00:39:00.553 --> 00:39:03.715]  But Shelly, you make it... Oh wait, why did you turn that down?
[00:39:04.115 --> 00:39:06.316]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[00:39:06.796 --> 00:39:11.299]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[00:39:11.479 --> 00:39:13.920]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.381]  I can do something like that.
[00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:17.802]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:20.824]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[00:39:20.884 --> 00:39:22.685]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[00:39:22.805 --> 00:39:25.046]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[00:39:25.426 --> 00:39:26.066]  I guess you're right.
[00:39:26.446 --> 00:39:27.107]  Why don't we try it?
[00:39:27.307 --> 00:39:29.248]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[00:39:29.682 --> 00:39:34.044]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[00:39:34.064 --> 00:39:35.725]  I know where we can get some more information.
[00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:40.508]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[00:39:40.748 --> 00:39:44.030]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[00:39:50.353 --> 00:39:51.634]  The BedFan is the answer.

[00:40:01.123 --> 00:40:01.824]  Attention!
[00:40:02.064 --> 00:40:03.486]  Attention everyone!
[00:40:03.506 --> 00:40:06.069]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:40:06.149 --> 00:40:07.831]  It's called Wrist Ease.
[00:40:07.891 --> 00:40:10.835]  The new patented, portable, ergonomic wrist support.
[00:40:11.497 --> 00:40:18.322]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.

[00:40:57.248 --> 00:40:59.969]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:41:02.211 --> 00:41:04.112]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:41:05.753 --> 00:41:08.034]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:41:15.084 --> 00:41:28.871]  I'm making a film right now about global government.
[00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:37.476]  I literally have hundreds of clips of world leaders talking about how they're going to create a one world government.
[00:41:38.152 --> 00:41:55.725]  I have their founding documents where they state a worldwide one-child policy, worldwide forced vaccinations, worldwide forced sterilizations, social workers managing and regulating every aspect of your lives.
[00:41:56.365 --> 00:42:00.168]  Folks, this stuff was written in the 1920s and is being implemented now.
[00:42:00.468 --> 00:42:02.369]  This is a long-term strategic goal.
[00:42:02.429 --> 00:42:04.891]  Basically, the money from the British Empire
[00:42:06.064 --> 00:42:07.926]  Teamed up with European and U.S.
[00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:14.192]  banking money, the Carnegies, the Mellons, the Reynolds, the Rockefellers, and about 10 other families.
[00:42:14.753 --> 00:42:27.866]  They openly got together and said, we're going to create multinational organizations, multinational governing bodies, League of Nations that failed, UN, 1945, IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, World Trade Organization.
[00:42:29.028 --> 00:42:31.431]  And we are going to implement a world government.
[00:42:31.752 --> 00:42:35.316]  Then meanwhile they have model UN and every high school and middle school in the U.S.
[00:42:35.356 --> 00:42:38.901]  and most private schools where they brainwash and take your children to UN events.
[00:42:39.461 --> 00:42:40.483]  You didn't know about this parent?
[00:42:40.503 --> 00:42:41.243]  Just ask your child.
[00:42:41.263 --> 00:42:42.465]  They've heard about it at their public school.
[00:42:42.765 --> 00:42:44.027]  Even at their private school, most of them.
[00:42:45.553 --> 00:43:00.656]  And to know about this, to see this happening, to see this ongoing, to see property rights being destroyed, to see our borders being destroyed, to see our military, now they're saying it's going to be more and more mercenaries, our police are going to be, quote, private.
[00:43:01.127 --> 00:43:02.527]  With governmental powers.
[00:43:03.188 --> 00:43:08.950]  Twenty percent of our ground force in Iraq, it was illegal and it was legalized to join many of the aggravated felons.
[00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:14.251]  Now they're talking about boosting that to half of the ground forces by the start of 2010.
[00:43:17.092 --> 00:43:19.513]  Now I read this in Army documents three or four years ago.
[00:43:19.593 --> 00:43:20.893]  Now it's in the AP!
[00:43:22.074 --> 00:43:23.974]  And they pitch it like it's good!
[00:43:24.975 --> 00:43:28.036]  I mean this stuff is earth-shattering.
[00:43:29.742 --> 00:43:30.603]  Here's another analogy.
[00:43:30.723 --> 00:43:36.066]  It's like you have a neighbor, and you know that they're robbing the other neighbor.
[00:43:36.106 --> 00:43:42.411]  The other neighbors have their car broken into three times, their house broken into twice, and you've seen the neighbor do it.
[00:43:44.452 --> 00:43:52.778]  And you call the police, and the police say, well, you saw him run towards that house, but you don't really know it's your neighbor, it was dark, you know the cop's gotta have evidence, okay, fine, whatever.
[00:43:53.178 --> 00:43:57.441]  But you go tell your neighbor, hey man, I saw Bill over here break into your car.
[00:43:58.321 --> 00:43:59.362]  Bill's on drugs, whatever.
[00:43:59.778 --> 00:44:02.399]  And your neighbor goes, oh I know Bill, that isn't true, I trust Bill.
[00:44:02.839 --> 00:44:04.740]  So you go pull up Bill's record.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.780]  You pay a PI to do it.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:06.680]  This is all hypothetical.
[00:44:06.961 --> 00:44:11.082]  And you find out Bill got out of prison three years earlier for a robbery.
[00:44:11.622 --> 00:44:17.384]  Then you go show your other neighbor, who's your good friend, hey look, Bill got out of jail for robbery.
[00:44:18.265 --> 00:44:19.765]  And just please read it.
[00:44:20.585 --> 00:44:21.026]  Please.
[00:44:21.146 --> 00:44:22.846]  And no, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:44:23.086 --> 00:44:24.067]  I'm not going to read it.
[00:44:25.647 --> 00:44:27.648]  That's basically what my job's like.
[00:44:29.093 --> 00:44:31.354]  Because everything I talk about is documented.
[00:44:31.654 --> 00:44:53.118]  When I get up on air and I say, the United Nations and several global private corporations, and I name them, are running giant child kidnapping rings, in the millions total over the last few years, and I reported that years ago, now it's been all over the foreign press, and then it's finally in the Chicago Tribune, two different pieces, because the governor calls for an investigation.
[00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:56.959]  DynCorp and Halliburton.
[00:44:58.587 --> 00:45:00.729]  And I have people call me up threatening me to shut up.
[00:45:00.809 --> 00:45:01.609]  I'm not going to shut up.
[00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:06.913]  I can't believe the public isn't in the streets protesting, freaking out, pulling their hair out.
[00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:09.976]  I mean, this is... That's just one of thousands of things!
[00:45:11.417 --> 00:45:24.185]  I know full well, and we have the university studies from the 20s and 30s with all these eugenicists and the Rockefellers funding the Nazis, but they were studying how to put different pathogens in vaccines, cancer viruses, toxins to sterilize women.
[00:45:24.406 --> 00:45:27.928]  The UN then got caught in Africa, India, and Latin America doing it.
[00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:32.191]  I have BBC reports, but again, the average person doesn't know about this.
[00:45:32.471 --> 00:45:34.112]  And then I tell you, don't take vaccines!
[00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:37.052]  This is the same government that gave black men syphilis!
[00:45:37.092 --> 00:45:38.493]  The same government with atomic soldiers!
[00:45:38.674 --> 00:45:40.755]  The same government that radiated tens of thousands of U.S.
[00:45:40.795 --> 00:45:41.176]  children!
[00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:45.800]  Just type Project Shad into Google.
[00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:47.521]  Project Shad.
[00:45:47.862 --> 00:45:50.624]  They would take our troops and say, uh, just march into this chamber.
[00:45:50.644 --> 00:45:53.527]  They'd hit them with nerve gas, kill our own troops, and then dissect their bodies.
[00:45:53.967 --> 00:45:55.429]  That's who runs our government!
[00:45:57.871 --> 00:45:58.471]  You know H.G.
[00:45:58.511 --> 00:46:00.153]  Wells, the father of science fiction.
[00:46:00.948 --> 00:46:02.269]  was the Queen's Futurist.
[00:46:02.669 --> 00:46:10.655]  He wrote more non-fiction books than he wrote books of fiction, like War of the Worlds, The Time Machine, and other famous books.
[00:46:11.896 --> 00:46:27.147]  I've got a clip I'm going to play in the next hour of a film that was made out of a book he wrote, Things to Come, where they openly announce a new world order, and they say they're not going to allow any nation states, and they're going to basically go after anybody that tries it.
[00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:32.912]  And the bad guys are the people, basically the Americans, that don't want world government.
[00:46:33.152 --> 00:46:38.155]  I mean, we got Hollywood movies made in 1937 about a new world order!
[00:46:42.517 --> 00:46:44.658]  I mean, this is what frustrates me.
[00:46:44.698 --> 00:46:53.722]  This thing is real, this thing is here, this thing is getting worse and worse and worse and worse, and they own both parties.
[00:46:53.882 --> 00:46:56.203]  Rupert Murdoch is behind Hillary Clinton.
[00:46:58.666 --> 00:47:03.709]  The Republicans and Democrats golf together, they sleep together, they go on vacations together.
[00:47:03.769 --> 00:47:05.310]  It's a big joke!
[00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.972]  You're talking about trillions of dollars they control.
[00:47:08.832 --> 00:47:13.395]  Multinational corporations have come in, private intelligence agencies and government intelligence agencies have come in.
[00:47:13.635 --> 00:47:15.236]  They've compromised our whole government.
[00:47:15.836 --> 00:47:19.358]  They basically milk the people's tax money that goes directly to corporate welfare.
[00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:22.620]  It's not free market, and I'm sick of it, and I want it to stop!
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.281]  Before we get into H.G.
[00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:28.004]  Wells in the next hour, when we start the next hour, I'll get into U.S.
[00:47:28.024 --> 00:47:28.344]  plans,
[00:47:29.324 --> 00:47:32.025]  Invasion, broad attack on Iran.
[00:47:32.105 --> 00:47:35.886]  We'll cover that first, but right now let's blitz through some of your phone calls.
[00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:42.488]  Joel, well, let's go to... There was a caller there that wanted to talk about Hillary.
[00:47:42.568 --> 00:47:43.808]  I guess they just hung up.
[00:47:43.848 --> 00:47:46.569]  That's why I looked back at my screen and they were gone.
[00:47:46.949 --> 00:47:49.410]  So let's go ahead and go to Joel in Wisconsin.
[00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.890]  You're on the air.
[00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.570]  Thanks for holding.
[00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.850]  Hey Alex.
[00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:52.851]  Belated Happy New Year.
[00:47:53.011 --> 00:47:53.711]  Good to hear from you.
[00:47:53.731 --> 00:47:54.331]  What's on your mind?
[00:47:55.223 --> 00:48:02.244]  Well, there's nothing more local than personal liberties, and I had the misfortune of having some campus security go on a fishing trip.
[00:48:02.624 --> 00:48:14.346]  It started with an illegal policy of unlawful use of a public internet terminal, and despite the fact that I am a student, they were going to charge me pretty much with a theft of service thing.
[00:48:14.666 --> 00:48:15.047]  Okay.
[00:48:15.527 --> 00:48:23.128]  It's illegal, so what they had to do was they dropped that, but they bait-and-switched me to give me a disorderly conduct.
[00:48:24.122 --> 00:48:31.909]  Now, I know you can't give legal advice, but if you... Well, I can do whatever I want, but I'm not going to give you legal advice because I don't know all the circumstances.
[00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:39.535]  Okay, but if you have like a personal anecdote or something I can Google, I know that... Well, I mean, it's simple.
[00:48:39.755 --> 00:48:40.936]  They'll try to make you plead bargain.
[00:48:40.956 --> 00:48:41.977]  You demand a jury trial.
[00:48:41.997 --> 00:48:43.639]  As long as you didn't touch them, you don't have a problem.
[00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:45.320]  Well, it's not even that.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:51.225]  What they're trying to do is they're trying to claim that the excuse they're using is what holds water, and I'm saying
[00:48:51.883 --> 00:48:56.084]  They instigated this whole thing to begin with because if they had even chosen... Oh, I know.
[00:48:56.104 --> 00:49:05.047]  Listen, there's hundreds of cases I see every month where the police come up and don't even have a reason to arrest you and then claim you were disorderly and arrest you for that.
[00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:08.888]  And then we get the squad car video and the person just, just, just ask questions.
[00:49:08.968 --> 00:49:11.148]  Talking, you know, to the police isn't allowed.
[00:49:11.168 --> 00:49:13.449]  And this is part of living in a third world police state.
[00:49:13.509 --> 00:49:14.749]  And listen, let me get something clear here.
[00:49:15.809 --> 00:49:21.331]  I was at Pokey Joe's today with my family and there are these two officers sitting there laughing at me the whole time I'm eating.
[00:49:22.136 --> 00:49:39.701]  And I don't know if their fans are like me, a lot of police like me, and are sophisticated enough to know I'm not anti-police, I'm anti-corruption, I'm anti the job they've been given, how their training has changed, and I don't like the fact that more and more of them will violate the Constitution and their oath of office.
[00:49:41.741 --> 00:49:42.862]  Their oath that they've sworn.
[00:49:44.742 --> 00:49:46.663]  Most of them haven't read the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:49:47.983 --> 00:49:50.904]  And I'm not against police, I'm against the fact
[00:49:51.656 --> 00:49:57.260]  That they have been federalized in their training, and more and more are federalized, just out and out federalized.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:03.423]  And that they're helping by... that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:50:03.443 --> 00:50:05.785]  I mean, tyranny comes to your door in a uniform, boys and girls.
[00:50:06.825 --> 00:50:10.528]  That at the end of the day, they're destroying their own children's future.
[00:50:10.608 --> 00:50:17.272]  And at the end of the day, they've been subtly twisted, subtly brainwashed, convinced that all these things they're doing are good.
[00:50:18.211 --> 00:50:29.695]  I mean, I got a sickening article today here where they're recruiting firemen now to be spies and tattletales, and firemen to have cameras videotaping people who are talking on cell phones or don't have their seatbelts on.
[00:50:30.095 --> 00:50:31.436]  You know, I love firemen.
[00:50:31.456 --> 00:50:32.616]  They're wonderful people.
[00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:35.257]  They're the last true public servants.
[00:50:35.557 --> 00:50:37.198]  They're heroes, firemen and women.
[00:50:37.678 --> 00:50:38.518]  I salute you.
[00:50:38.578 --> 00:50:39.879]  I give money to the fire department.
[00:50:40.699 --> 00:50:43.580]  They've done stuff to help me with my grandparents in the past.
[00:50:44.136 --> 00:50:44.636]  I don't think so.
[00:51:00.154 --> 00:51:05.157]  The government and the media has always got excuses to surveil and manipulate and violate rights.
[00:51:05.177 --> 00:51:16.225]  But at the end of the day, those running and owning and lobbying and manipulating and pulling the strings of our government are criminal, in spades, and they're the ones that need to be watched, arrested, controlled, dominated.
[00:51:16.665 --> 00:51:18.086]  And I just want the police to know that.
[00:51:18.546 --> 00:51:20.007]  You're not criminal, most of you.
[00:51:20.047 --> 00:51:21.268]  Most of you are good men and women.
[00:51:21.528 --> 00:51:22.489]  You've got a tough job.
[00:51:22.989 --> 00:51:28.733]  But the state you work for, the government you work for, is totally rogue, totally out of control,
[00:51:29.384 --> 00:51:30.966]  And destroying our country.
[00:51:31.786 --> 00:51:32.607]  Now, you've got a choice.
[00:51:32.627 --> 00:51:37.731]  You're going to stand with the people and the Republic, or with the private corporations that have had a hostile takeover of our government.
[00:51:38.092 --> 00:51:39.673]  We'll be right back with a second hour.
[00:51:40.113 --> 00:51:40.614]  Stay with us.
[00:51:50.583 --> 00:51:51.764]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:51.884 --> 00:51:56.687]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[00:51:56.807 --> 00:51:59.688]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[00:51:59.828 --> 00:52:03.831]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[00:52:04.151 --> 00:52:10.174]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[00:52:10.334 --> 00:52:11.915]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:11.995 --> 00:52:14.337]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:21.536 --> 00:52:24.018]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:52:24.478 --> 00:52:26.399]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:30.282]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:30.923 --> 00:52:37.407]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:52:38.168 --> 00:52:40.369]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:41.190]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.391]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:43.311]  Yes, there is one.
[00:52:52.617 --> 00:52:59.221]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio interview.
[00:52:59.381 --> 00:53:00.562]  Scrap your soul, Shannon.
[00:53:00.602 --> 00:53:01.182]  Hold on.
[00:53:02.183 --> 00:53:03.564]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:04.964 --> 00:53:06.785]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:08.166 --> 00:53:09.727]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:10.127 --> 00:53:12.949]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:16.771]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:26.996]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:30.159 --> 00:53:32.582]  We'll have wide open phones in the second hour.
[00:53:32.602 --> 00:53:34.404]  I'm here every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:36.306]  Central Standard Time.
[00:53:36.326 --> 00:53:37.007]  That's 5 to 7 p.m.
[00:53:37.107 --> 00:53:38.409]  Eastern Time.
[00:53:39.246 --> 00:53:53.953]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525, or locally in Central Texas, if you're listening to the Mothership station I broadcast out of, that's 836-0590, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:53:54.033 --> 00:53:56.934]  Todd, Tom, many others that are patiently holding, we'll get to you.
[00:53:57.254 --> 00:54:00.576]  Let me first, at the start of this hour, get into war news.
[00:54:01.809 --> 00:54:05.893]  Twenty-three soldiers died in one day over the weekend.
[00:54:05.953 --> 00:54:12.720]  This is the first of the surge of 3,600 troops arrived in Baghdad and surrounding areas.
[00:54:13.061 --> 00:54:25.113]  The surge, and of course every general, every top military expert who's just neutral on this, has said that taking the troops out of the armored compounds like the Green Zone
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:38.466]  And what's sticking them in 16 extra little police substations, unguarded, in Baghdad and other areas, other hotspots, is just providing more targets and guaranteeing an acceleration of the troops being killed.
[00:54:38.806 --> 00:54:39.966]  And that indeed has happened.
[00:54:39.986 --> 00:54:43.608]  They started sticking them outside the high-walled bases and they're dying!
[00:54:43.868 --> 00:54:45.168]  And it does absolutely nothing!
[00:54:46.129 --> 00:54:49.210]  It just gives the insurgency more people to shoot at.
[00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.011]  But Bush talks about sacrifice
[00:54:51.536 --> 00:54:53.497]  Yes, it's human sacrifice we're talking about.
[00:54:54.777 --> 00:54:55.797]  What's the logic there?
[00:54:55.817 --> 00:54:57.298]  Escalating the war.
[00:54:59.158 --> 00:55:02.199]  Now, let's get into a story here out of the Korea Times.
[00:55:02.219 --> 00:55:05.140]  It's also in several other major international publications.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:09.421]  The story is reposted up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:55:10.382 --> 00:55:16.203]  Right now, as a top story, if you'd like to go read it along with me, or read the entire story, I'm just going to read a few paragraphs.
[00:55:16.343 --> 00:55:16.624]  U.S.
[00:55:16.664 --> 00:55:21.245]  plans invasion, broad attack on Iran.
[00:55:21.857 --> 00:55:34.849]  You see, the plan originally, with the Israeli 83 plan, that was implemented in 2002 for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was not what you heard on the news, to go put the lights on and help the people and, you know, take care of them and get in and get out.
[00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:44.638]  It was always to build permanent bases and to use Iraq, as the PNAC documents written by the Vice President and Jeb Bush stated, as in Wolfowitz and Perl and the rest of them,
[00:55:46.044 --> 00:55:49.507]  And Crystal to launch an attack on Iran and Syria.
[00:55:49.547 --> 00:55:59.254]  So even if you're for this war, the government and the media were dishonest together against the people and lied to us and lied to the troops and said you'll be back by next Christmas.
[00:56:00.034 --> 00:56:01.676]  Which was a complete and total lie.
[00:56:01.696 --> 00:56:07.060]  They said less than one year and we're coming up on four years here in just a few months.
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.182]  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:56:10.202 --> 00:56:11.443]  They're also doing stop-loss.
[00:56:11.483 --> 00:56:13.705]  People have already served two, three, four tours.
[00:56:13.725 --> 00:56:15.306]  They're now starting over there.
[00:56:16.249 --> 00:56:16.570]  U.S.
[00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:18.772]  plans invasion, broad attack on Iran.
[00:56:19.173 --> 00:56:19.433]  U.S.
[00:56:19.453 --> 00:56:27.664]  contingency planning for military action against Iran's nuclear program goes beyond limited strikes and would effectively unleash a war against the country, a former U.S.
[00:56:27.724 --> 00:56:29.566]  intelligence analyst said on Friday.
[00:56:29.926 --> 00:56:31.108]  I've seen some of the planning.
[00:56:31.529 --> 00:56:34.172]  You're not talking about a surgical strike, said Wayne White.
[00:56:34.412 --> 00:56:39.994]  Who was a top Middle East analyst for the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research until March of 2005.
[00:56:40.375 --> 00:56:44.977]  You're talking about a war against Iran that likely would destabilize the Middle East for years to come.
[00:56:45.017 --> 00:56:46.497]  And then we've got to stay even longer, see?
[00:56:46.837 --> 00:56:49.078]  They're getting us into a fight that just gets bigger and bigger.
[00:56:49.799 --> 00:56:50.019]  Why?
[00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:53.780]  Do defense contractors make more money if we were there 6 months or if we were there 20 years?
[00:56:54.301 --> 00:56:56.001]  And now they admit we'll be there 30 years.
[00:56:56.061 --> 00:56:57.402]  You see, they lied to us again.
[00:56:59.512 --> 00:57:00.132]  It continues.
[00:57:00.152 --> 00:57:05.815]  You're talking about a war against Iran that would likely destabilize the Middle East for years, White told the Middle East Policy Council of Washington.
[00:57:05.835 --> 00:57:06.276]  Think Tank.
[00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:11.098]  We're not talking about just surgical strikes against an array of targets inside Iran.
[00:57:11.338 --> 00:57:22.344]  We're talking about clearing a path to the targets by taking out much of the Iranian Air Force, Kilo-class submarines, anti-ship missiles that could target commerce or U.S.
[00:57:22.384 --> 00:57:26.626]  warships in the Gulf, and maybe even Iran's ballistic missile capability, White said.
[00:57:27.805 --> 00:57:28.846]  Hundreds of targets.
[00:57:29.246 --> 00:57:31.769]  I'm much more worried about the consequences of a U.S.
[00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:41.398]  or Israeli attack against Iran's infrastructure, which would prompt vigorous Iranian retaliation, he said, than the civil war in Iraq, which could be confined to that country.
[00:57:41.438 --> 00:57:44.541]  So basically, the global private banks are destroying our borders.
[00:57:45.359 --> 00:57:46.280]  Figure this out, folks.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:58:01.107]  The same people destroying the dollars valued, in case you hadn't checked, it's been devalued by half now, the same people destroying our borders and our sovereignty, the same people destroying our Bill of Rights and Constitution, the heart of what America is all about, are the same ones running these phony wars.
[00:58:01.708 --> 00:58:04.929]  It doesn't matter if it's Democrats or Republicans, they're all together.
[00:58:05.129 --> 00:58:12.093]  All the committee chairmen, all the major leadership, unless you're talking about Senator Hagel, who's just positioning himself for the 08 run for the presidency.
[00:58:13.733 --> 00:58:18.359]  President George W. Bush has stressed he is seeking a diplomatic solution, just as he promised.
[00:58:18.399 --> 00:58:20.382]  Remember, I promised we want a diplomatic resolution.
[00:58:20.402 --> 00:58:21.683]  There's no plan to attack Iraq.
[00:58:21.924 --> 00:58:23.326]  Turned out it was a total lie.
[00:58:23.346 --> 00:58:25.729]  They planned to attack them all along and lied to the public.
[00:58:25.749 --> 00:58:29.814]  Again, the point is, even before the war, they cannot lie to us all the time.
[00:58:30.464 --> 00:58:31.424]  This is improper.
[00:58:31.765 --> 00:58:32.585]  This is a fraud.
[00:58:33.065 --> 00:58:37.187]  They didn't just mess up, oh, we screwed up, we thought WMDs were there.
[00:58:37.707 --> 00:58:49.293]  We have the White House memo, the White House confirms is authentic, where four months before the attack, him and Tony Blair in the White House for hours talking about how to stage WMD fines, how to lie, how to frame people!
[00:58:51.134 --> 00:58:52.695]  Does that not make you mad?
[00:58:52.735 --> 00:58:53.555]  It makes me angry.
[00:58:56.207 --> 00:58:56.667]  It goes on.
[00:58:56.727 --> 00:59:00.929]  President Bush has stressed he is seeking a diplomatic solution to the dispute over Iran's nuclear program.
[00:59:01.009 --> 00:59:01.589]  Total lie.
[00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:04.070]  But he has not taken the military option off the table.
[00:59:04.611 --> 00:59:13.394]  At his recent rhetoric plus together financial sanctions and actions against Iran, involvement in Iraq has revived talk in Washington about a possible U.S.
[00:59:13.474 --> 00:59:14.835]  attack on Iran.
[00:59:15.075 --> 00:59:22.178]  The Bush administration and many of its Gulf allies have expressed growing concern about Iran's rising influence in the region and the prospect of it acquiring nuclear weapons.
[00:59:23.112 --> 00:59:32.458]  George Bush Senior, Bill Clinton, and then Bush, even his first eight months, nine months in office, publicly blocked FBI investigations of AQ Khan Laboratories.
[00:59:32.478 --> 00:59:40.423]  If you don't know what that is, if you're going to shoot your mouth off about having to turn the place into a parking lot, but you can't find it on a map, you need to know the facts.
[00:59:41.023 --> 00:59:50.269]  Our government, the British government, the Israeli government, helped transfer the materials, controlled materials, to build nuclear weapons and missiles to Pakistan!
[00:59:52.606 --> 00:59:56.449]  Again, just like they helped arm Russia, helped arm China, helped arm North Korea.
[00:59:56.489 --> 01:00:03.774]  Who was on the board of ABB, the Swiss company, as the chairman, when they transferred reactors to make A-bombs to Kim Jong-il of North Korea?
[01:00:04.055 --> 01:00:09.479]  Donald Rumsfeld, who transferred the chemical and biological weapons in 1983 and 1984 to Saddam.
[01:00:09.679 --> 01:00:11.840]  Donald Rumsfeld, who got aspartame approved.
[01:00:11.861 --> 01:00:17.945]  Donald Rumsfeld, who got Terminator genes in the seeds, destroying our crops and screwing up the whole biosphere.
[01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:19.046]  Donald Rumsfeld!
[01:00:21.981 --> 01:00:23.543]  I mean, my gosh!
[01:00:24.784 --> 01:00:25.824]  This gets me boiling.
[01:00:25.844 --> 01:00:27.085]  So I'm done with that report.
[01:00:27.846 --> 01:00:31.169]  We are going to break here in a few minutes, but let's jam one call in.
[01:00:31.389 --> 01:00:32.670]  We'll go to Todd, then Tom.
[01:00:33.251 --> 01:00:35.552]  Let's talk to Todd in Corpus Christi, Texas.
[01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:36.273]  You're on the air.
[01:00:36.313 --> 01:00:36.853]  Sir, go ahead.
[01:00:37.574 --> 01:00:38.355]  Hi there, Mr. Jones.
[01:00:38.395 --> 01:00:39.295]  Welcome back from your vacation.
[01:00:39.516 --> 01:00:43.299]  I just want to start out by saying the gentleman who set in for you did a wonderful job while you were gone.
[01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:45.721]  I love Dacey's take on the U.N.
[01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:48.843]  and the internationalists, and Jack Blood is just awesome.
[01:00:48.863 --> 01:00:49.384]  Two great hosts.
[01:00:51.198 --> 01:00:59.269]  Yeah, I wanted to recommend to your audience out there, um, I picked up America Freedom to Fascism, one of my latest purchases from your online shop, and that is a fantastic movie.
[01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:05.318]  Extremely powerful, and I just want to, you know, for the record, you know, ask you again, now copies of that are authorized, right?
[01:01:06.141 --> 01:01:08.303]  I didn't make America Freedom to Fascism.
[01:01:08.343 --> 01:01:21.692]  No, I know, but... Aaron Russo did, and he said on my show, you can make copies of America Freedom to Fascism, you can buy America Freedom to Fascism, the history of the Federal Reserve, the IRS, and The Globalist at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:01:24.685 --> 01:01:29.450]  Right now, if somebody in your audience hasn't seen it yet or purchased it, it is highly recommended.
[01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:29.930]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:35.255]  Now, this, to me, seems like the greatest blow to the internationalists, exposing the Federal Reserve.
[01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:36.456]  Yeah, the Federal Reserve's private.
[01:01:36.997 --> 01:01:41.982]  Folks, the true elite aren't, quote, into going out and having free market businesses and making money.
[01:01:42.182 --> 01:01:43.483]  They literally make the money.
[01:01:43.563 --> 01:01:44.084]  They print it.
[01:01:44.424 --> 01:01:46.025]  They give orders to our Treasury.
[01:01:46.345 --> 01:01:47.445]  It is a total fraud.
[01:01:47.505 --> 01:01:48.506]  It is British owned.
[01:01:48.846 --> 01:01:49.626]  It is a joke.
[01:01:49.666 --> 01:01:51.707]  We were reconquered by Britain in 1913.
[01:01:51.827 --> 01:01:53.467]  It is an absolute fact.
[01:01:53.788 --> 01:02:01.770]  Listen, Alan Greenspan in 1968 published a book that was published by the imprint of Ayn Rand, exposing the Federal Reserve.
[01:02:01.911 --> 01:02:03.271]  I own the ridiculous thing.
[01:02:03.591 --> 01:02:05.572]  Okay, he was an anti-New World Order guy.
[01:02:05.612 --> 01:02:08.853]  They came and bought him off in 84 and made him Fed Chairman.
[01:02:09.113 --> 01:02:11.094]  I got Alan Greenspan talking like me.
[01:02:11.707 --> 01:02:15.791]  Alan Greenspan wrote a book saying it's privately owned and a fraud and a scam.
[01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:18.453]  And he was so effective at fighting them, they hired him!
[01:02:19.374 --> 01:02:19.914]  Anything else?
[01:02:20.575 --> 01:02:20.935]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:20.955 --> 01:02:22.376]  Can I continue on the other side, or hold?
[01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:24.058]  Well, what else you got to cover?
[01:02:24.618 --> 01:02:26.119]  Well, it deals with the Federal Reserve.
[01:02:26.139 --> 01:02:27.961]  I've got a couple of two-point... Real fast.
[01:02:28.021 --> 01:02:28.601]  I'll put you on hold.
[01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:29.342]  We'll get back.
[01:02:29.382 --> 01:02:30.203]  We'll go to you in another call.
[01:02:30.223 --> 01:02:31.284]  You've got to give another call each time.
[01:02:31.544 --> 01:02:32.625]  Tons of more news straight ahead.
[01:02:32.645 --> 01:02:33.025]  Stay with us.
[01:02:40.425 --> 01:02:40.966]  Yeah.
[01:02:52.242 --> 01:02:53.122]  It's no secret.
[01:02:53.382 --> 01:02:58.863]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[01:02:59.043 --> 01:03:03.804]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:03:04.144 --> 01:03:06.445]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:03:06.645 --> 01:03:09.225]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called No-BO.
[01:03:09.465 --> 01:03:17.627]  No-BO eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[01:03:17.807 --> 01:03:21.988]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in No-BO.
[01:03:22.348 --> 01:03:28.550]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:32.891]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[01:03:33.051 --> 01:03:37.413]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[01:03:37.593 --> 01:03:41.534]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[01:03:41.894 --> 01:03:44.435]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[01:03:44.575 --> 01:03:47.376]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[01:03:51.912 --> 01:03:55.515]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[01:04:48.394 --> 01:04:52.395]  Oh, crap!
[01:04:52.435 --> 01:04:55.736]  It's here!
[01:04:55.916 --> 01:05:00.678]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:05:01.038 --> 01:05:08.660]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:16.439]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:16.839 --> 01:05:19.742]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:05:20.163 --> 01:05:22.485]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:05:22.905 --> 01:05:23.726]  NSA spies.
[01:05:24.201 --> 01:05:28.243]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:28.563 --> 01:05:32.164]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:32.524 --> 01:05:34.465]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:34.785 --> 01:05:38.687]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:51.638 --> 01:05:54.159]  We're talking with Paul Dow from Timeshares Only.
[01:05:54.239 --> 01:05:58.001]  Paul, I hear you've just come out with this great new kit that you're giving away?
[01:05:58.101 --> 01:06:05.744]  Yeah, it's called the Top 10 Secrets to Buying and Selling Timeshares, and it's just a phenomenal resource for anybody looking to sell their timeshare.
[01:06:05.904 --> 01:06:06.805]  Well, tell us about it.
[01:06:06.945 --> 01:06:09.906]  Well, first of all, it tells you what your timeshare is really worth.
[01:06:10.186 --> 01:06:10.566]  Uh-huh.
[01:06:10.807 --> 01:06:12.949]  And more importantly, how to sell it for top dollar.
[01:06:12.989 --> 01:06:16.492]  Well, there are thousands of people out there just waiting to buy your timeshare.
[01:06:17.112 --> 01:06:20.315]  But you sort of need to learn the secrets to getting the most cash for it.

[01:06:21.876 --> 01:06:27.001]  Yes, but it's only a limited time offer, so you need to call our toll-free number now, and we'll rush it right out.
[01:06:27.181 --> 01:06:30.824]  Well, sounds like a pretty sweet thing for really anybody who owns a timeshare.
[01:06:31.204 --> 01:06:31.825]  It really is.
[01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:33.726]  It could make you thousands of dollars.
[01:06:34.587 --> 01:06:37.729]  Okay, the top ten secrets to buying and selling timeshares.
[01:06:37.809 --> 01:06:39.030]  Here's the phone number to call.
[01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:39.650]  It's 1-800-550-3903.
[01:06:39.691 --> 01:06:40.211]  Again, that's 1-800-550-3903.
[01:06:40.231 --> 01:06:40.291]  1-800-550-3903.
[01:06:40.311 --> 01:06:43.593]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:07:04.419 --> 01:07:16.366]  All right, I want to take your calls on the Iran situation, the fact that it's a much larger attack and invasion even of western areas of the country that of course just so happen to have most of their oil supplies.
[01:07:17.526 --> 01:07:25.711]  And I want to get into HG Wells and how long futurists and different leaders, intellectual leaders, have been calling for a world government.
[01:07:26.931 --> 01:07:27.772]  That's coming up.
[01:07:28.314 --> 01:07:29.095]  In the next segment.
[01:07:29.135 --> 01:07:30.456]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:07:30.516 --> 01:07:31.256]  Real quick, Todd.
[01:07:31.276 --> 01:07:31.717]  Finish up.
[01:07:32.657 --> 01:07:33.278]  In Corpus Christi.
[01:07:33.318 --> 01:07:33.838]  Go ahead, Todd.
[01:07:34.679 --> 01:07:36.140]  Yeah, this is not Corpus Christi.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.061]  This is Tom.
[01:07:37.341 --> 01:07:37.921]  Tom, you finish.
[01:07:37.981 --> 01:07:38.602]  Okay, Tom.
[01:07:39.082 --> 01:07:39.503]  I'm sorry.
[01:07:40.063 --> 01:07:42.325]  Tom, you talk about what you have to talk about.
[01:07:42.345 --> 01:07:43.085]  Then I'll go back to Todd.
[01:07:43.105 --> 01:07:43.466]  Go ahead.
[01:07:44.006 --> 01:07:45.767]  Oh, I'm sorry, Alex.
[01:07:45.807 --> 01:07:46.488]  Good talk to you.
[01:07:46.808 --> 01:07:48.650]  Let's try to keep it short and sweet here.
[01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:55.795]  My wife reached in her mailbox and pulled out a letter that on the front of it says, your response is required by law.
[01:07:55.815 --> 01:07:57.096]  That's read it up off the envelope.
[01:07:57.691 --> 01:08:04.713]  And then on the inside it says, 2006 Agricultural Identification Survey.
[01:08:04.813 --> 01:08:07.513]  Do I have to send this information in?
[01:08:07.573 --> 01:08:09.094]  I don't want to chip my chickens.
[01:08:09.634 --> 01:08:10.354]  Worked all my life.
[01:08:10.394 --> 01:08:13.154]  Now, is that a federal or is that a state survey?
[01:08:14.475 --> 01:08:15.135]  Well, let me see.
[01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:18.616]  It is from... I got the envelope right here and a lamp.
[01:08:19.236 --> 01:08:20.096]  I'm enjoying myself.
[01:08:20.136 --> 01:08:21.016]  My pond is full.
[01:08:21.056 --> 01:08:22.677]  Ron Paul's running for president.
[01:08:22.717 --> 01:08:23.817]  My God, I got hope again.
[01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:24.797]  Where are you calling from?
[01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:26.491]  Bertram, Texas.
[01:08:29.173 --> 01:08:32.375]  National Agricultural Statistics Service.
[01:08:33.256 --> 01:08:34.957]  Jeffersonville, Indiana.
[01:08:35.597 --> 01:08:36.858]  Okay, let me break this down.
[01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:40.661]  Big agribusiness and all big global corporations do this.
[01:08:40.721 --> 01:08:45.645]  They lobby governments to write regulatory laws to shut down small producers.
[01:08:45.685 --> 01:08:52.410]  The number one poultry, and of course you've got raised chickens, poultry, Tyson and others, lobbied millions of dollars
[01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:53.330]  We're good to go.
[01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:11.790]  Your phone was just breaking up.
[01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:21.173]  To shut down small beef producers, small herd, the average ranch is about 40 head of cattle.
[01:09:21.193 --> 01:09:23.134]  That's just enough to pay the taxes and pay for the land.
[01:09:24.094 --> 01:09:25.555]  So it's targeted to shut that down.
[01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:31.277]  And out of all 50 states, only three states adopted the federal guidelines.
[01:09:31.337 --> 01:09:33.238]  It's not really a law, it's guidelines.
[01:09:33.518 --> 01:09:35.099]  Texas fully adopted
[01:09:36.014 --> 01:09:41.459]  And they're talking about $1,000 a day fines if you don't report a cow that dies within three days.
[01:09:42.299 --> 01:09:44.041]  So it's just a whole new level.
[01:09:44.061 --> 01:09:46.823]  It's like a new IRS just got added to your life.
[01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:49.824]  You need to get involved with the groups that are fighting it.
[01:09:50.344 --> 01:09:56.751]  On Texas Independence Day, there's going to be a huge demonstration with Democrats, Republicans, you name it, in downtown Austin against it all over the country.
[01:09:56.791 --> 01:09:57.652]  It's being thrown out.
[01:09:58.192 --> 01:10:00.955]  State governors are refusing to implement it, so it's in deep trouble.
[01:10:01.296 --> 01:10:03.618]  But in Texas, we implement everything first.
[01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:09.024]  The global toll roads that foreign companies run, as long as they have billboards of you guys with cowboy hats,
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.701]  Saying it's a Texas thing to have a tracker chip and get taxed.
[01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.181]  And you know, radio ads.
[01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:15.261]  I'm a Texan!
[01:10:15.541 --> 01:10:16.961]  I get tracked by chips!
[01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:18.662]  See how dumb they think we are?
[01:10:18.842 --> 01:10:21.502]  They just have some stupid cowboy image.
[01:10:22.442 --> 01:10:23.803]  They sell us our slavery.
[01:10:24.283 --> 01:10:26.483]  I've got tracker chips on my chickens!
[01:10:26.603 --> 01:10:27.563]  I'm a good boy!
[01:10:28.004 --> 01:10:29.364]  I'm fighting Al-Qaeda!
[01:10:30.684 --> 01:10:35.485]  I could go on for hours about the National Animal Identification Program.
[01:10:36.312 --> 01:10:42.695]  This, what you mentioned, is part of the National Premises Identification Program, and it should state the U.S.
[01:10:42.775 --> 01:10:43.175]  Code.
[01:10:43.215 --> 01:10:49.458]  You need to get in touch with, you need to use the search engine, get in touch with different organizations that have formed to fight it.
[01:10:50.398 --> 01:11:04.644]  The head group that fights it here in Texas is based here in Austin, and that would take a whole show to get into that, but no, it's a fraud, it's a scam, and if everybody just ignores it and says no to it, it'll just go away, or you can start answering hundreds of questions about your farm or ranch,
[01:11:04.997 --> 01:11:09.480]  Two bureaucrats in Washington, the new American way, here in the land of the cowards, the home of the slaves.
[01:11:09.781 --> 01:11:19.848]  I'd like it to be the land of the free, home of the brave again, but this, I mean, you know, it's like I heard it on radio news earlier, going, doctors will now be interrogating you, does anyone beat you, does anyone hurt you?
[01:11:20.148 --> 01:11:21.630]  So they can report that to the police.
[01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:27.214]  And see, it all sounds good, but it's all about the state getting control of everybody's lives.
[01:11:27.614 --> 01:11:31.137]  The new system is literally social workers running our lives.
[01:11:31.457 --> 01:11:32.298]  Total control.
[01:11:32.358 --> 01:11:32.758]  Remember,
[01:11:33.328 --> 01:11:36.949]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions, but the people that run our government are criminal.
[01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:39.310]  So no matter how good it sounds, it's bad.
[01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:40.211]  Okay?
[01:11:40.251 --> 01:11:42.912]  If a crime has been committed, you need to call the police and they can handle it.
[01:11:43.372 --> 01:11:44.752]  You know, it's the same thing in California.
[01:11:45.332 --> 01:11:47.853]  They've introduced a bill to ban any spanking.
[01:11:48.934 --> 01:11:50.694]  Now, I'm not going to debate whether that's good or bad.
[01:11:51.655 --> 01:11:54.856]  The point is, this is about the state getting involved in your life.
[01:11:55.156 --> 01:11:58.357]  This is about the state and the schools it says are going to interrogate your children.
[01:11:58.537 --> 01:12:00.238]  This is about the schools being prisons.
[01:12:00.962 --> 01:12:13.550]  I mean, we go from the schools ten years ago giving you pops when you get in a fight or, you know, yell at your teacher, and I got plenty of them, and I think it was good, to now the school being a secret police facility spying and tattling on parents.
[01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:17.553]  If a child is hurt by their parents, then that's criminal.
[01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:20.815]  But you notice that most people
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.105]  I think that spanking's illegal when it isn't, but the feds are trying to lobby states to pass laws to do it.
[01:12:27.485 --> 01:12:29.487]  Most people think vaccines are the laws.
[01:12:29.707 --> 01:12:30.388]  There is no law.
[01:12:30.408 --> 01:12:31.569]  You've got to take these vaccines.
[01:12:31.909 --> 01:12:33.771]  It's all color of law fraud.
[01:12:34.131 --> 01:12:37.795]  Same thing with the Premises Identification Act passed last year.
[01:12:38.635 --> 01:12:39.877]  Let's jam some more in here.
[01:12:40.677 --> 01:12:42.419]  Let's go back to Todd quickly.
[01:12:42.479 --> 01:12:44.241]  Corpus Christi had a comment about the Federal Reserve.
[01:12:44.261 --> 01:12:44.581]  Go ahead.
[01:12:48.783 --> 01:12:49.664]  I'm going to let him go.
[01:12:49.744 --> 01:12:54.108]  Let's now go ahead and talk to Ed in Utah.
[01:12:54.268 --> 01:12:54.989]  Ed, you're on the air.
[01:12:55.029 --> 01:12:55.449]  Go ahead.
[01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.171]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:12:57.431 --> 01:13:00.174]  Very good news about Ron Paul running for president.
[01:13:00.634 --> 01:13:09.462]  In fact, it's your listeners, Alex, that will be a big part of his push, along with, of course, as you know, he has ties to the rank and file of the John Birch Society.
[01:13:10.123 --> 01:13:11.965]  He writes a column in the American Free Press.
[01:13:12.352 --> 01:13:13.533]  And he's also a libertarian.
[01:13:13.573 --> 01:13:15.394]  We need to bring all those forces together.
[01:13:15.695 --> 01:13:18.277]  But I think you're one of the driving forces behind this, Alex.
[01:13:18.417 --> 01:13:19.818]  Well, he's got the trifecta.
[01:13:19.838 --> 01:13:21.639]  He's got the Democrats because he's anti-war.
[01:13:21.699 --> 01:13:24.862]  He's got any Republican who's got half a brain because he's a true conservative.
[01:13:25.302 --> 01:13:27.564]  And he's got the libertarians because he is a libertarian.
[01:13:28.124 --> 01:13:29.045]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:13:29.445 --> 01:13:37.592]  And I just want to ask you, in light of your opening monologue about these Judas Goats, these people that pretend to be conservative, etc.
[01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:45.673]  Is there any chance, given that Alex, that you would bring on Michael Piper, who has just authored that book by that name, The Judas Ghost?
[01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:47.755]  You know he's with the American Free Press, of course.
[01:13:48.836 --> 01:13:49.456]  Yes, I do.
[01:13:49.476 --> 01:13:55.581]  In fact, you were up in Canada with his colleague there, Jim Tucker?
[01:13:55.801 --> 01:13:57.182]  Yes, covering the Bilderberg Conference.
[01:13:57.282 --> 01:13:57.822]  Right, right.
[01:13:57.902 --> 01:14:06.589]  But Michael Piper has named the whole supposed anti-war antics and whatnot of both Bill, who was spying on anti-war people,
[01:14:06.949 --> 01:14:09.611]  He was actually working as an employee of the CIA.
[01:14:09.631 --> 01:14:10.471]  Many people know this.
[01:14:10.872 --> 01:14:13.853]  But John Kerry... Exactly.
[01:14:13.893 --> 01:14:15.314]  Bill Clinton was really CIA.
[01:14:15.594 --> 01:14:19.857]  It's now mainstream news in England that Tony Blair was MI5 all through college.
[01:14:20.117 --> 01:14:22.138]  Look, presidents are spooks now.
[01:14:22.419 --> 01:14:24.760]  Presidents are intelligence agency officers.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.321]  We don't have real presidents.
[01:14:26.621 --> 01:14:27.942]  It's all completely staged.
[01:14:28.002 --> 01:14:29.583]  I appreciate your call.
[01:14:29.603 --> 01:14:30.664]  You're absolutely right.
[01:14:30.964 --> 01:14:34.126]  Let's talk to Victor in Granite Shoals.
[01:14:34.546 --> 01:14:36.448]  Texas, you're on the air.
[01:14:36.568 --> 01:14:36.929]  Welcome.
[01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:38.790]  Alex.
[01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:39.551]  Yes.
[01:14:40.352 --> 01:14:50.842]  Yeah, I'm curious about the things that you've exposed about the police state and what they're doing nationally and going in unauthorized, searching and stuff like that.
[01:14:50.943 --> 01:14:51.663]  I'm a gun owner.
[01:14:52.624 --> 01:14:55.447]  And first of all, I want to say that I appreciate all that you're doing.
[01:14:55.487 --> 01:14:57.309]  I pray for you because I think you need prayer.
[01:14:58.461 --> 01:15:02.245]  What can you say about how this is going to correlate to the end times?
[01:15:02.305 --> 01:15:10.872]  I mean, I'm a proponent of the pre-trib rapture, and it looks almost like you're talking tribulation stuff here.
[01:15:11.812 --> 01:15:15.075]  Well, here's the thing, and I appreciate your call.
[01:15:15.095 --> 01:15:16.456]  It's a very important question.
[01:15:16.496 --> 01:15:20.720]  I may not have time in this segment to answer it, but I may have some time to cover it in the next segment.
[01:15:22.321 --> 01:15:26.925]  I'm a Christian, but I do a news show and I analyze it
[01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:30.280]  From a secular perspective.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.121]  That is, I just cover what's happening.
[01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:35.822]  You can decide spiritually what that means to you.
[01:15:36.622 --> 01:15:42.025]  But I do have comments about the pre-tribulation rapture crowd.
[01:15:43.025 --> 01:15:47.267]  And I'm not going to try to take you to the bloodshed here on this, but this is important.
[01:15:47.287 --> 01:15:47.767]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:51.869 --> 01:15:55.912]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:15:56.132 --> 01:15:59.534]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:15:59.694 --> 01:16:03.216]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:16:03.436 --> 01:16:06.678]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:16:06.858 --> 01:16:12.182]  This basic tenant of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[01:16:12.222 --> 01:16:17.465]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill,
[01:16:17.665 --> 01:16:21.847]  Now, going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:16:21.967 --> 01:16:23.268]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:29.230]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:33.692]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:16:33.772 --> 01:16:35.093]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:16:35.313 --> 01:16:39.675]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822, or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:16:39.855 --> 01:16:41.196]  That toll-free number again?
[01:16:41.216 --> 01:16:41.276]  1-877-928-8822.
[01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:42.557]  Shelly, you look ex... Oh, wait!
[01:16:42.937 --> 01:16:44.197]  Why did you turn that down?
[01:16:44.237 --> 01:16:46.458]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[01:16:58.107 --> 01:17:02.670]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:05.292]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[01:17:05.552 --> 01:17:06.753]  I think it's something like that.
[01:17:06.773 --> 01:17:12.216]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night, and you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[01:17:12.256 --> 01:17:14.057]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[01:17:14.177 --> 01:17:16.419]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[01:17:16.819 --> 01:17:17.440]  I guess you're right.
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:18.500]  Why don't we try it?
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.662]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[01:17:21.102 --> 01:17:25.465]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer, and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[01:17:25.765 --> 01:17:27.106]  I know where we can get some more information.
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:31.863]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[01:17:32.123 --> 01:17:35.406]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[01:17:52.498 --> 01:17:54.863]  Attention, attention everyone!
[01:17:54.983 --> 01:17:57.448]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:17:57.508 --> 01:17:59.192]  It's called Wrist Ease.
[01:17:59.252 --> 01:18:02.218]  The new patented, portable, ergonomic wrist support.
[01:18:02.862 --> 01:18:09.683]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.

[01:18:23.546 --> 01:18:27.526]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.

[01:18:32.547 --> 01:18:38.051]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.

[01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:43.074]  That's Wristease.

[01:18:48.617 --> 01:18:50.458]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[01:18:52.037 --> 01:19:00.545]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:19:00.785 --> 01:19:02.587]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:19:02.807 --> 01:19:03.928]  That's one in four adults.
[01:19:04.312 --> 01:19:10.417]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[01:19:10.677 --> 01:19:14.360]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[01:20:17.321 --> 01:20:18.601]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:18.641 --> 01:20:19.701]  Glad that you've joined us here.
[01:20:19.722 --> 01:20:21.002]  We've got two segments left.
[01:20:21.022 --> 01:20:29.203]  We're going to go to some of the callers that are patiently holding here in just a few minutes at 877-590-5525 or locally 836-0590.
[01:20:29.343 --> 01:20:33.644]  Let me just answer the caller in the last segment's question.
[01:20:33.664 --> 01:20:37.905]  He said, pre-trib or mid or post.
[01:20:39.105 --> 01:20:46.507]  And in Revelations, it talks about when Christ returns, first the dead and Christ rising and then the living.
[01:20:48.394 --> 01:20:54.057]  And then they came out with the Schofield Reference Bible, a little over a hundred years ago, and they said, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:54.578 --> 01:20:56.419]  Christians have nothing to worry about.
[01:20:56.459 --> 01:20:57.899]  You'll never face the Antichrist.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:04.103]  Well, the Bible says that you'll make war on the saints and overcome them, and persecute Christians and others.
[01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:11.528]  And then, basically, when Hitler came to power, people said, oh, he's the Antichrist.
[01:21:11.548 --> 01:21:12.909]  He said, oh, don't worry, we'll be raptured.
[01:21:12.929 --> 01:21:13.689]  And you saw what happened.
[01:21:14.415 --> 01:21:19.937]  And whenever Africans are getting killed, Christian Africans, they always think, oh, we'll be raptured, and then they get killed.
[01:21:20.698 --> 01:21:22.738]  It just happens over and over and over again.
[01:21:22.758 --> 01:21:25.880]  They thought they were going to be raptured when the Romans were killing them.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:32.743]  So this was going on before Schofield, but he really codified it, and a few other people pushed it.
[01:21:33.803 --> 01:21:43.427]  And regardless of whether God's going to pull us out of this next week, or ten years from now, or a million years from now, I have a moral job to stand up against corruption.
[01:21:44.013 --> 01:21:48.154]  Chicago Tribune reports our government and private corporations are running giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:21:49.734 --> 01:21:50.554]  I'm going to talk about it.
[01:21:52.035 --> 01:21:56.676]  And people say, oh, well, praise God, that means the end is near.
[01:21:57.116 --> 01:22:05.517]  No, it means evil is growing and out of control because good men and women have done little or nothing to stop what's happening and to fight the corruption.
[01:22:07.098 --> 01:22:13.359]  And nowhere, you'll hear your preacher all Sunday long tell you're going to be raptured out of this before anything ever bad happens because you're so scared of the devil.
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.923]  I never saw that in the Bible, and it's nowhere in there.
[01:22:17.104 --> 01:22:24.613]  But the government has lobbied and helped fund a lot of these fake preachers, and it is a religion of laying down and going along with corruption.
[01:22:25.505 --> 01:22:27.046]  And it's absolutely amazing.
[01:22:27.307 --> 01:22:45.862]  You know, I challenge people to tell me where it is in the Bible, not in some reference or not in some footnote some preacher added to a Bible, where it is in Revelation, where it is in Daniel, where it is anywhere in the Bible that a golden rope is going to fall down out of heaven and jerk you out of a bad situation or out of the end times.
[01:22:47.343 --> 01:22:48.925]  I mean, please explain it to me and tell me.
[01:22:49.005 --> 01:22:50.386]  Alright, now let's get back to the news here.
[01:22:51.604 --> 01:22:52.804]  It's just a huge cop-out.
[01:22:52.844 --> 01:22:56.565]  I don't have to do anything because God's going to pull me out of it before anything bad happens.
[01:22:57.006 --> 01:22:58.446]  And you look at what's going on around us.
[01:22:59.826 --> 01:23:01.507]  No, God helps those that help themselves.
[01:23:01.747 --> 01:23:04.528]  We're supposed to stand up against the wicked ones.
[01:23:05.068 --> 01:23:05.968]  Over and over again in the Bible.
[01:23:06.008 --> 01:23:07.228]  Who will stand up against the wicked ones?
[01:23:07.268 --> 01:23:08.389]  Who will stand up against corruption?
[01:23:08.589 --> 01:23:10.049]  Who will stand up for the widows and orphans?
[01:23:10.589 --> 01:23:14.330]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:16.931]  Not pull people out on golden ejection seats.
[01:23:17.991 --> 01:23:20.252]  Now, I talked earlier about a book.
[01:23:20.896 --> 01:23:21.617]  I forget the name.
[01:23:21.657 --> 01:23:22.697]  It was so many years ago.
[01:23:22.757 --> 01:23:23.498]  Somebody gave it to me.
[01:23:23.518 --> 01:23:24.058]  I looked it up.
[01:23:24.498 --> 01:23:28.581]  And it was a compilation of essays by four or five people by Ann Rand.
[01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:31.583]  And the big essay in there, the biggest one was written in 1968 by...
[01:23:35.003 --> 01:23:41.287]  The former Federal Reserve Chairman, but at the time he was just an economist in New York, Alan Greenspan.
[01:23:41.307 --> 01:23:45.009]  Against the Federal Reserve, it's private, the New World Order, we've got to fight it.
[01:23:45.610 --> 01:23:54.656]  I'm glad I thought of that today, because I need to go find the name of that book, because it's somewhere in my house, and I've got to do storage things, and God knows how many books I've got.
[01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.497]  I was looking around for it a few years ago and couldn't find it.
[01:23:56.517 --> 01:23:57.377]  I just remembered it again.
[01:23:58.438 --> 01:24:01.200]  But there it is in that book, Alan Greenspan laying it all out.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:08.622]  And there's hundreds of books like that, but there's also books written by globalists who are for it, admitting that they're setting up a New World Order.
[01:24:09.803 --> 01:24:11.824]  Stalin said he was setting up a New World Order.
[01:24:12.224 --> 01:24:14.084]  Hitler said he was setting up a New World Order.
[01:24:14.865 --> 01:24:24.928]  That's why people who were informed, the guy that set up Rhodesia, north of South Africa, Cecil Rhodes, the head of the Diamond Monopoly for the Queen of England, said he was setting up a New World Order.
[01:24:24.968 --> 01:24:28.850]  He set up the Rhodes Scholarship that Bill was a member of.
[01:24:29.877 --> 01:24:40.524]  And they openly bring them in to be minions of the New World Order, to be captains, to be Ringwraith Nazgul, basically, to go out and enforce all of this.
[01:24:41.824 --> 01:24:44.146]  And so when George Bush Sr.
[01:24:44.266 --> 01:24:55.153]  in 1990, 1991, and 1992 gave State of the Union speeches saying a New World Order, a New World Order coming into view, people freaked out because historians and folks that were informed knew what it meant.
[01:24:55.233 --> 01:24:57.274]  Now, who coined the phrase
[01:24:59.170 --> 01:25:05.235]  Well, the father of science fiction, but he wrote more non-fiction and more futurist books than he wrote fiction.
[01:25:06.156 --> 01:25:13.362]  The Time Machine, The Island of Dr. Maru, just on and on and on, War of the Worlds, H.G.
[01:25:13.402 --> 01:25:13.682]  Wells.
[01:25:15.764 --> 01:25:16.044]  H.G.
[01:25:16.104 --> 01:25:24.571]  Wells, ladies and gentlemen, was a futurist to the Queen, an admitted socialist, he believed in one-child policies, he believed in human culling.
[01:25:24.991 --> 01:25:25.912]  I've read his book
[01:25:26.607 --> 01:25:27.487]  I mean, I remember its title.
[01:25:27.507 --> 01:25:28.187]  It's easy to remember.
[01:25:28.427 --> 01:25:29.628]  The New World Order.
[01:25:29.668 --> 01:25:31.588]  Just type The New World Order by H.G.
[01:25:31.608 --> 01:25:32.388]  Wells into Google.
[01:25:32.668 --> 01:25:34.388]  You can read it for free online.
[01:25:34.868 --> 01:25:35.849]  Or go to the library.
[01:25:35.909 --> 01:25:36.689]  They'll have a copy.
[01:25:37.969 --> 01:25:38.309]  Okay?
[01:25:39.369 --> 01:25:44.110]  The guy who wrote War of the Worlds wrote a non-fiction book called The New World Order.
[01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:46.530]  And he wrote it, what was it, like 1908.
[01:25:47.571 --> 01:25:50.911]  Now, he writes a book called The New World Order.
[01:25:52.831 --> 01:25:55.792]  And he calls for the three regions, American Union,
[01:25:57.148 --> 01:26:01.552]  European Union, Asian Union, and they say no nation-states, one-child policies.
[01:26:02.012 --> 01:26:03.494]  That's everything you see now!
[01:26:03.954 --> 01:26:05.776]  That's why China gets all the big UN awards.
[01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:06.556]  They're the model.
[01:26:06.736 --> 01:26:10.880]  With all their tyranny and censorship and control, that's what the global owners want to make America like.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.201]  The Queen of England loved it.
[01:26:12.241 --> 01:26:13.202]  The King of England loved it.
[01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:14.123]  They funded it.
[01:26:14.363 --> 01:26:15.824]  Cecil Rhodes implemented it.
[01:26:16.085 --> 01:26:18.447]  This guy was worth billions, you know, a hundred years ago.
[01:26:18.987 --> 01:26:20.548]  The guy had countries named after him.
[01:26:20.588 --> 01:26:21.069]  Rhodesia!
[01:26:21.621 --> 01:26:29.486]  And they implemented it, and they got the best minds, and they set up the intelligence agencies, the CIA, OSS before that, and they did it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:29.786 --> 01:26:30.526]  They set it up.
[01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:31.407]  They did it.
[01:26:31.727 --> 01:26:33.408]  They were able to do it.
[01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:35.269]  Now, here is a clip.
[01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:37.730]  This is a clip from the 1937 film, Things to Come.
[01:26:43.081 --> 01:26:52.647]  These big black stealth bombers, it looks like a stealth bomber, they land with these emissaries, saying, we don't have a government, but if you don't do what we say, we'll come bomb you and take you over.
[01:26:53.048 --> 01:27:03.034]  The good guy wears a black Nazi uniform, he shows up at these different warring areas, and says, oh, I forgot, because this is happening in the late 40s, there's World War II.
[01:27:03.154 --> 01:27:04.575]  Remember, this is written in 1937.
[01:27:05.656 --> 01:27:10.359]  World War II happens, and out of World War II is birthed a new world order.
[01:27:10.979 --> 01:27:11.820]  A new order.
[01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:14.432]  I'll show you the control these people have got.
[01:27:15.252 --> 01:27:15.952]  This was written in 1937.
[01:27:16.012 --> 01:27:21.895]  He wrote a book 20 years before that called The New World Order that was non-fiction.
[01:27:21.955 --> 01:27:22.635]  This was fiction.
[01:27:22.855 --> 01:27:24.156]  This was called The Things to Come.
[01:27:24.696 --> 01:27:25.517]  He actually wrote it before that.
[01:27:25.557 --> 01:27:26.177]  The movie came out in 1937.
[01:27:27.178 --> 01:27:32.340]  And so, in this, he comes in and he tells the king of this little area
[01:27:33.021 --> 01:27:39.042]  That he's not allowed to have wars, and he's not allowed to have a national government.
[01:27:39.062 --> 01:27:40.343]  There's going to be a world government.
[01:27:40.783 --> 01:27:42.343]  But the world government isn't really a government.
[01:27:42.383 --> 01:27:44.104]  It's just a group of masons.
[01:27:44.664 --> 01:27:46.604]  He's not really, I guess, talking about classic Freemasons.
[01:27:46.624 --> 01:27:49.025]  That's a whole other area of discussion.
[01:27:49.085 --> 01:27:50.465]  But listen to this.
[01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:52.666]  This is from the 1937 film.
[01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:57.147]  I think we've got time to play.
[01:27:57.187 --> 01:27:58.087]  Okay.
[01:27:58.207 --> 01:27:59.447]  Let's play it now before we go to break.
[01:27:59.487 --> 01:27:59.747]  Go ahead.
[01:27:59.847 --> 01:28:00.207]  Here it is.
[01:28:03.089 --> 01:28:04.590]  So that's the sort of man your boss is.
[01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:06.251]  Not an unusual type.
[01:28:06.352 --> 01:28:09.674]  Everywhere we find these little semi-military upstarts robbing and fighting.
[01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:11.956]  That's what endless warfare has led to.
[01:28:12.336 --> 01:28:12.817]  Brigandage.
[01:28:13.417 --> 01:28:14.158]  What else could happen?
[01:28:15.118 --> 01:28:19.722]  But we, who are all the left of the old engineers and mechanics, have paged ourselves to salvage the world.
[01:28:20.282 --> 01:28:21.763]  We have the airways, all that's left of them.
[01:28:22.004 --> 01:28:22.744]  We have the seas.
[01:28:24.145 --> 01:28:25.426]  And we have ideas in common.
[01:28:26.807 --> 01:28:27.948]  The brotherhood of efficiency.
[01:28:28.809 --> 01:28:30.090]  The Freemasonry of science.
[01:28:32.168 --> 01:28:35.089]  We're the last trustees of civilization when everything else has failed.
[01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:36.370]  Where'd you come from?
[01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:37.771]  Who are you?
[01:28:37.791 --> 01:28:38.731]  Wings over the world.
[01:28:40.492 --> 01:28:42.713]  Oh, you know you can't come into a country like this in this fashion.
[01:28:43.033 --> 01:28:43.374]  I'm here.
[01:28:43.414 --> 01:28:45.535]  Do you mind if I sit down?
[01:28:47.616 --> 01:28:51.257]  And now, for the fourth time, who are you?
[01:28:51.718 --> 01:28:53.298]  I tell you, wings over the world.
[01:28:53.498 --> 01:28:53.919]  That's nothing.
[01:28:53.959 --> 01:28:54.979]  What government do you under?
[01:28:55.079 --> 01:28:55.640]  Common sense.
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:58.201]  I belong to world communication.
[01:28:59.221 --> 01:29:00.222]  We just run ourselves.
[01:29:01.581 --> 01:29:03.902]  You want him to tumble every time I'm here in wartime?
[01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:06.084]  What's the game?
[01:29:07.164 --> 01:29:08.085]  Order and trade.
[01:29:08.285 --> 01:29:09.106]  Trade, eh?
[01:29:10.426 --> 01:29:12.888]  Now look here, Mr. Levy, let's see how we stand.
[01:29:12.928 --> 01:29:14.149]  Come down to actuality.
[01:29:15.029 --> 01:29:17.951]  The way you swagger, you don't seem to realize you're under arrest.
[01:29:19.252 --> 01:29:22.434]  Okay, when we get back, we'll back up a few seconds where he says, what's your goal?
[01:29:23.582 --> 01:29:25.243]  Order, world order, and trade.
[01:29:25.363 --> 01:29:26.063]  See, that's globalism.
[01:29:26.103 --> 01:29:27.083]  Oh, it's a trade deal.
[01:29:27.103 --> 01:29:27.803]  It's a trade deal.
[01:29:27.823 --> 01:29:28.784]  Oh, we're going to end war.
[01:29:28.984 --> 01:29:30.484]  Meanwhile, they're behind all the wars.
[01:29:30.684 --> 01:29:32.165]  They're there to destroy a free market.
[01:29:32.565 --> 01:29:33.845]  They're there to totally enslave you.
[01:29:33.945 --> 01:29:35.006]  We'll come back, finish it up.
[01:29:35.026 --> 01:29:35.386]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.756 --> 01:29:54.500]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[01:30:52.269 --> 01:30:54.270]  Pinch me, Bill.
[01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:55.471]  I can't believe it.
[01:30:55.911 --> 01:30:58.653]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[01:30:59.073 --> 01:31:01.555]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[01:31:02.722 --> 01:31:03.823]  I know what you mean, John.
[01:31:04.223 --> 01:31:07.946]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[01:31:08.526 --> 01:31:12.329]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:12.429 --> 01:31:13.990]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:19.354]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[01:31:19.654 --> 01:31:20.715]  And I owe it all to you.
[01:31:21.315 --> 01:31:24.616]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:24.696 --> 01:31:27.717]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[01:31:27.737 --> 01:31:29.077]  I want to tell everybody.
[01:31:29.297 --> 01:31:32.658]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[01:31:33.018 --> 01:31:34.699]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[01:31:34.979 --> 01:31:37.600]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:43.962]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[01:31:44.222 --> 01:31:45.062]  What a concept!
[01:31:52.051 --> 01:31:52.652]  It's a fact.
[01:31:52.832 --> 01:31:57.255]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:31:57.715 --> 01:32:02.919]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:06.402]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:32:06.662 --> 01:32:13.768]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:32:14.128 --> 01:32:21.335]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:32:21.755 --> 01:32:23.597]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:32:24.058 --> 01:32:32.506]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt instead of living each day in fear.
[01:32:32.826 --> 01:32:34.087]  It's time to turn your life around
[01:32:34.087 --> 01:32:34.447]  I think so.

[01:34:03.935 --> 01:34:04.975]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:06.656 --> 01:34:07.836]  Alright, final segment.
[01:34:07.876 --> 01:34:08.996]  Got four or five calls.
[01:34:09.016 --> 01:34:10.057]  I want to try to jam in here.
[01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:10.897]  Everybody be patient.
[01:34:10.917 --> 01:34:12.177]  But let me finish up with this H.G.
[01:34:12.217 --> 01:34:13.678]  Wells thing for those that just joined us.
[01:34:13.978 --> 01:34:14.758]  He's a futurist.
[01:34:14.778 --> 01:34:18.659]  He wrote a book called The New World Order almost a hundred years ago.
[01:34:19.369 --> 01:34:20.710]  He was the futurist of the Queen.
[01:34:20.730 --> 01:34:23.152]  They adopted many of his plans.
[01:34:24.032 --> 01:34:26.814]  This clip is from a fiction book he wrote, Things to Come.
[01:34:26.874 --> 01:34:28.555]  It was made into a 1937 movie.
[01:34:29.016 --> 01:34:32.518]  This is a propaganda film made prior to World War II.
[01:34:33.078 --> 01:34:46.888]  This movie shows a utopian vision after an apocalyptic war, where the saviors of mankind come dressed as Nazi stormtroopers and stealth bombers, dropping peace gas and taking over the world from sovereign nations to bring a, quote, free masonry of science.
[01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:52.843]  This is a Sikh vision, which is promoted by many groups today, hoping for their new order.
[01:34:53.163 --> 01:34:56.344]  The Nazis tried this out, as many others have come to do the same.
[01:34:56.424 --> 01:35:05.987]  Ironically, the future seat of the Sikh New World Order in the movie is Basra, Iraq, where the white men of the New World Order developed their technology to subdue rogue nations.
[01:35:06.787 --> 01:35:06.967]  And H.G.
[01:35:07.387 --> 01:35:10.008]  Wells wrote that World War III would happen in Iraq.
[01:35:10.675 --> 01:35:11.595]  As did Albert Pike.
[01:35:11.635 --> 01:35:12.736]  He wrote that in 1876.
[01:35:13.996 --> 01:35:15.457]  These guys have a long-term plan.
[01:35:15.477 --> 01:35:16.678]  I mean, these are published books.
[01:35:17.038 --> 01:35:20.839]  But this... Let's go back to the clip where he's saying order and trade is their goal.
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:22.460]  No, no, no, no.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.061]  They don't have a government, but they have a military.
[01:35:24.081 --> 01:35:25.921]  They'll smash you if you don't go under their command.
[01:35:25.941 --> 01:35:27.142]  So that's doublespeak.
[01:35:27.842 --> 01:35:28.663]  Let's go back to the clip.
[01:35:29.563 --> 01:35:31.044]  I belong to world communication.
[01:35:32.104 --> 01:35:33.084]  We just run ourselves.
[01:35:33.145 --> 01:35:33.505]  Hey!
[01:35:34.445 --> 01:35:37.026]  You are in the tumbling economy here in wartime.
[01:35:38.487 --> 01:35:38.927]  What's the game?
[01:35:40.023 --> 01:35:40.944]  Order and trade.
[01:35:41.144 --> 01:35:42.004]  Trade, eh?
[01:35:43.305 --> 01:35:44.586]  Now look here, Mr. Aviator.
[01:35:44.626 --> 01:35:45.746]  Let's see how we stand.
[01:35:45.786 --> 01:35:47.027]  Come down to actuality.
[01:35:47.907 --> 01:35:50.789]  The way you swagger, you don't seem to realize you're under arrest!
[01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:52.350]  You and your machine!
[01:35:53.491 --> 01:35:56.572]  You will find other planes looking for me if I happen to be delayed.
[01:35:56.752 --> 01:35:57.973]  We'll deal with them later.
[01:35:59.454 --> 01:36:01.315]  I even started a trading agency here, if you like.
[01:36:01.335 --> 01:36:02.636]  I have no objection.
[01:36:03.336 --> 01:36:06.638]  The first thing we shall want is to get our planes in the air again.
[01:36:06.938 --> 01:36:07.178]  What?
[01:36:07.438 --> 01:36:08.299]  A laudable ambition?
[01:36:09.090 --> 01:36:11.551]  But our new order has an objection to private aeroplanes.
[01:36:11.611 --> 01:36:12.371]  The impudence!
[01:36:12.891 --> 01:36:14.352]  I'm not talking about private aeroplanes.
[01:36:15.412 --> 01:36:17.072]  Our aeroplanes are public aeroplanes.
[01:36:17.973 --> 01:36:20.614]  This is an independent sovereign state at war.
[01:36:21.494 --> 01:36:23.054]  I know nothing about any old order.
[01:36:24.015 --> 01:36:28.276]  I'm the chief here, and I'm not taking any orders old or new from you.
[01:36:28.296 --> 01:36:31.837]  I suppose I've walked into trouble.
[01:36:32.017 --> 01:36:33.518]  Yeah, you can take that as right.
[01:36:37.219 --> 01:36:38.139]  Where have you come from?
[01:36:39.358 --> 01:36:41.459]  I flew from our headquarters at Basra this morning.
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.642]  We have some hundreds of new type planes and we're building more, fast.
[01:36:46.082 --> 01:36:47.283]  The factories are working again.
[01:36:47.703 --> 01:36:50.865]  We're gradually restoring order and trade in the whole Mediterranean area.
[01:36:51.225 --> 01:36:53.446]  We're scouting this region now to see how things are.
[01:36:53.486 --> 01:36:54.427]  You'll find out.
[01:36:55.407 --> 01:36:57.528]  This is an independent sovereign state.
[01:36:57.989 --> 01:36:59.429]  Yes, we must talk about that.
[01:36:59.590 --> 01:37:00.850]  We don't discuss it.
[01:37:01.811 --> 01:37:04.232]  We don't approve of independent sovereign states.
[01:37:04.332 --> 01:37:05.553]  You don't approve?
[01:37:05.993 --> 01:37:06.974]  We mean to stop them.
[01:37:07.414 --> 01:37:08.074]  That's war.
[01:37:08.415 --> 01:37:08.875]  If you will.
[01:37:11.937 --> 01:37:13.478]  Well, I think we know how we stand.
[01:37:15.038 --> 01:37:17.119]  Listen, stick with me.
[01:37:17.159 --> 01:37:19.720]  If it gives you any trouble, cut it.
[01:37:21.221 --> 01:37:24.923]  Okay, so they're against war, but they're gonna come attack them, and they do.
[01:37:25.083 --> 01:37:39.069]  They hit them with knockout gas, and then enslave everybody, and then it moves on to the West going to the stars, and everything's a utopia under world government, with a secret group, who won't say who they are, who swoop down and bomb you so you can't develop weapons of mass destruction.
[01:37:41.113 --> 01:37:44.254]  And he wrote this years before it was made into a film in 1937.
[01:37:44.334 --> 01:37:55.476]  I mean, this is the type of in-your-face, and he's an admitted pro-world government, the number one science fiction writer of all time who wrote more non-fiction books than fiction.
[01:37:55.876 --> 01:38:03.498]  So this is like a literal religion for these people.
[01:38:04.498 --> 01:38:06.078]  Okay, you already had a world empire.
[01:38:06.579 --> 01:38:08.719]  The British Empire tied in with big central banks.
[01:38:09.477 --> 01:38:12.559]  And it teamed up with the robber barons here in the U.S.
[01:38:12.599 --> 01:38:19.603]  and a few in Europe, and they all openly brag about this, and they got hooked up with a bunch of futurists.
[01:38:20.383 --> 01:38:29.269]  The Huxley family, Aldous Huxley in 1962, right before he died, gave a speech saying, hey, I wrote Brave New World because my brother, you know, is involved in eugenics.
[01:38:29.309 --> 01:38:36.313]  He later became the head of the United Nations eugenics program, the head of UNESCO, Julian Huxley, and he said,
[01:38:37.854 --> 01:38:48.297]  They married into the Darwin family, and they basically sold to the Queen, and to the King, and to the big banks, this plan of how to order the world government.
[01:38:48.317 --> 01:38:50.897]  Literally, some science fiction writers, H.E.
[01:38:50.937 --> 01:39:01.180]  Wells is the number one individual in this group, went and cooked up this whole thing, and folks, here we are, a hundred years after the program's been launched, and we're in the middle of it.
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:06.501]  And they say we must start wars to then make the people beg for world government to stop wars.
[01:39:07.136 --> 01:39:08.657]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:39:08.957 --> 01:39:11.700]  So now you know the game plan, my friends.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.843]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andy in Central Austin.
[01:39:15.863 --> 01:39:16.743]  You're on the air, Andy.
[01:39:16.763 --> 01:39:17.364]  Thanks for holding.
[01:39:17.804 --> 01:39:18.084]  All right.
[01:39:18.765 --> 01:39:19.125]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:39:19.165 --> 01:39:19.425]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:20.606 --> 01:39:21.867]  I was just curious.
[01:39:21.927 --> 01:39:24.870]  I realize your show is syndicated nationwide, but I was just curious.
[01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:31.375]  Well, it's only on about six stations now, but it's growing, and we're really excited.
[01:39:31.515 --> 01:39:33.176]  Plus, we have a huge Internet listenership, yes.
[01:39:33.766 --> 01:39:34.267]  Okay, okay.
[01:39:34.287 --> 01:39:37.109]  I was just curious if you were going to be at TalkFest next weekend.
[01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:43.015]  Okay, George Norrie called me about a month ago and said that he wanted me to be in studio.
[01:39:43.315 --> 01:39:47.980]  If he was coming to Austin on Friday, he wasn't sure to do his show in studio.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.344]  Then, a week before I went on vacation, they called me and said, yeah, he's coming.
[01:39:52.604 --> 01:39:56.548]  We want you to co-host with him for two hours of the show, be in studio here at KLBJ.
[01:39:56.808 --> 01:39:57.869]  So I know that's happening.
[01:39:58.565 --> 01:40:09.813]  And I know he mentioned, and I'll probably want you at TalkFest, but how it happened last time is I was up here co-hosting with him in studio for three hours, and he just said, hey, come on down tomorrow and be with me.
[01:40:10.113 --> 01:40:13.736]  So, yes, there's a good chance I'll be there.
[01:40:14.076 --> 01:40:16.157]  If not, I'm just as happy to be at home with my family.
[01:40:16.758 --> 01:40:17.498]  All right, well, thanks, Alex.
[01:40:17.939 --> 01:40:19.900]  Yeah, TalkFest is coming up, what, next Saturday?
[01:40:20.529 --> 01:40:20.889]  That's right.
[01:40:21.190 --> 01:40:22.030]  It's going to be huge.
[01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:25.793]  I mean, last time it was like three or four thousand people.
[01:40:26.054 --> 01:40:27.455]  Just when I was there, there was that many.
[01:40:27.735 --> 01:40:29.516]  It was overflow down at the convention center.
[01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:36.642]  Neil Bortz will be there, Clark Howard, George Norey, and some of the local crew are going to be there.
[01:40:36.662 --> 01:40:37.463]  So it's going to be exciting.
[01:40:39.044 --> 01:40:39.184]  Cool.
[01:40:39.204 --> 01:40:40.025]  Well, thank you for taking my call.
[01:40:40.045 --> 01:40:40.966]  All right, man.
[01:40:41.006 --> 01:40:41.867]  Hope to see you there.
[01:40:43.188 --> 01:40:48.032]  What I've been trying to talk about today is the fact that the plan for world government is real.
[01:40:48.992 --> 01:40:49.633]  It's happening.
[01:40:51.042 --> 01:41:01.966]  And the Royals and the big Robert Barron elites got sold on a plan for world government, a covert plan for world government.
[01:41:02.226 --> 01:41:03.846]  And now we're in the North American Union.
[01:41:04.106 --> 01:41:05.527]  Now the European Union is here.
[01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:11.489]  And under this system, they remove nation-states because they don't like our Republic.
[01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:13.330]  They don't like our Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:15.450]  They don't like England's Magna Carta from 1215.
[01:41:18.129 --> 01:41:32.077]  You know, for those out there who are for world government, I get your emails, I get your calls, you'll admit, you'll say, okay Alex, yeah, we're setting up a world government, you're not even part of it, but you think you are, and it'll end war and be a utopia and we'll have wonderful freedom and man working together.
[01:41:33.338 --> 01:41:35.840]  That's how they sell people on the outer room.
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:39.442]  That's how they sell people that are more low-level.
[01:41:40.916 --> 01:41:52.409]  Really, it's about powerful elites that are control freaks, who want to totally dominate human development, and who want one-child policies, and like Dr. Bianca at UT, want to eliminate 90% of the world's population!
[01:41:52.429 --> 01:41:54.651]  I mean, that's in UN documents!
[01:41:55.592 --> 01:41:56.853]  And I'm just here warning you!
[01:41:57.514 --> 01:41:59.877]  And I'm going to continue to be here warning you!
[01:42:00.417 --> 01:42:01.598]  This stuff is real!
[01:42:02.039 --> 01:42:03.020]  This is happening!
[01:42:03.889 --> 01:42:05.472]  And we've got to defend this country.
[01:42:06.193 --> 01:42:07.015]  We are just out of time.
[01:42:07.055 --> 01:42:10.641]  I know we have a few other callers on the board here, but I don't have time to get to your calls.
[01:42:10.701 --> 01:42:13.065]  Please join me next week from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:42:14.027 --> 01:42:14.388]  right here.
[01:42:15.657 --> 01:42:18.378]  At this same time, you can listen via InfoWars.com.
[01:42:18.398 --> 01:42:23.260]  You can listen to some of our stations also stream as well, like NewsRadio 590KLBJ.
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:25.581]  We have a link to that up on InfoWars.com.
[01:42:25.601 --> 01:42:26.721]  A whole bunch of streams available.
[01:42:26.842 --> 01:42:30.863]  I know a few of the other stations that pick us up also stream their shows over the internet.
[01:42:31.183 --> 01:42:34.184]  So there's a lot of different ways to listen to the show or write off the satellite.
[01:42:34.625 --> 01:42:40.947]  A caller called in earlier talking about America, freedom to fascism, that off their own documents and own admissions and the IRS Commissioner's own admissions.
[01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:45.439]  Talk about the private Federal Reserve, the IRS, the North American Union.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.044]  We have that at InfoWars.com on the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[01:42:50.404 --> 01:42:53.967]  I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com and get America free from the fascism.
[01:42:54.027 --> 01:42:58.311]  Or my new film, Terror Storm, the history of government sponsored terror.
[01:42:58.331 --> 01:42:59.312]  It's a two hour film.
[01:42:59.612 --> 01:43:02.555]  The first thirty minutes is CIA.gov documents.
[01:43:02.975 --> 01:43:06.959]  The government admits they staged terror, but they go in the forties and fifties and sixties.
[01:43:07.359 --> 01:43:09.921]  They don't admit it past that point, but it's declassified.
[01:43:10.341 --> 01:43:12.903]  Our government, which is not our government, it's a criminal group.
[01:43:12.923 --> 01:43:19.128]  I'm talking about the people who really run the government, not the puppet presidents, and I'm talking about the intelligence agencies, the bureaucracies, the State Department.
[01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:23.892]  They admit they blew up school buses, churches, mosques, they shot crowds.
[01:43:24.412 --> 01:43:32.539]  From Guatemala to Iran, to Vietnam, they staged... Have you ever seen Graham Greene's The Quiet American?
[01:43:32.599 --> 01:43:34.020]  That's based on a true story.
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:35.221]  They just changed the names.
[01:43:35.854 --> 01:43:39.338]  Where the CIA is bombing women and children to blame it on people.
[01:43:39.978 --> 01:43:47.686]  Meanwhile, funding the Communists of the Soviet Union to Vietnam to keep the war going, to then create an anti-war movement in the U.S.
[01:43:47.926 --> 01:43:50.028]  to be channeled into support of the U.N.
[01:43:50.329 --> 01:43:56.575]  They stage the wars, they build up the dictators, they create the crises, then they offer their world government solution.

[01:44:06.681 --> 01:44:07.982]  We had a four-camera shoot there.
[01:44:08.082 --> 01:44:09.843]  It's also the extra on the film.
[01:44:11.084 --> 01:44:11.844]  So powerful.

[01:44:30.444 --> 01:44:33.388]  I want to thank Ennis, Genesis, all the sponsors, and you, the listeners.
