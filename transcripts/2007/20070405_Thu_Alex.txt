[00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.969]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.710]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.530]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.990]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.731]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:17.251]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:21.572]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:41.458]  Well, we have a huge broadcast lined up for you today on the fifth day of April 2007.
[00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:44.479]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:51.482]  Dr. Stephen Jones, the physicist, will be joining us to go over the latest 9-11 inside job developments.
[00:00:51.702 --> 00:01:00.286]  And we've got William Rodriguez joining us, a hero, one of the heroes of 9-11, in the third hour with some important developments as well.
[00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:09.495]  I'm also now carrying his film with his speeches and presentations, it's excellent, up on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:18.361]  Yesterday, at about 2.15, I got the idea to start a website with petitions to support Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:26.526]  And within a few hours, well, really about 8, 9 at night, they had it up, but we'd never had
[00:01:28.993 --> 00:01:34.276]  I guess petition software or message board software ever on my websites, which we're going to do in the future.
[00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:36.557]  We're going to do it soon.
[00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:43.361]  And so we use the HoloScan, HaloScan system, and like over 1,500 people signed up for it.
[00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:45.882]  It crashed their ridiculous system.
[00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:47.943]  I guess it's designed to not let you have that many.
[00:01:48.383 --> 00:01:52.986]  We've retrieved the signatures for the petition in support of free speech and Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:59.329]  And this will, I guess, take a while to get loaded onto another page saved.
[00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:05.071]  And then you can keep posting on the HoloScan, and then we'll move those to another page of your petition.
[00:02:05.752 --> 00:02:09.073]  And I want to get 10,000 of these by the end of the day up there.
[00:02:10.494 --> 00:02:12.855]  But we've got to get it rolling first, which we're working on.
[00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:31.105]  It's important because CNN, Fox, MSNBC, CNBC, mainstream broadcast television, magazines, newspapers are all calling Dennis Miller for Rosie O'Donnell's head, basically.
[00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:41.092]  And they're calling for her to be crucified for her free speech, for the First Amendment, to set the precedent that no one else go public.
[00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:48.216]  Do you understand a whole gaggle of big Hollywood stars are inches from going public on 9-11 being an inside job?
[00:02:49.901 --> 00:03:00.546]  Do you realize that there is a domino effect of Air Force officers and Marine Corps officers and Army officers and Navy officers that have already gone public and that more and more are going public?
[00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:07.809]  It's in the hundreds now and it's going to soon be in the thousands as it becomes safer for more and more people to come across the line.
[00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:09.369]  That's why this is important.
[00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.872]  We're not covering this because it's got a big TV host, you know, slash movie stars.
[00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:15.792]  He's been in a lot of movies.
[00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:18.333]  And oh, it's a Hollywood issue.
[00:03:18.373 --> 00:03:19.293]  We could care less.
[00:03:19.674 --> 00:03:22.255]  The point is America pays attention to stars.
[00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:25.476]  This does take a lot of courage on Rosie O'Donnell's part.
[00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:31.739]  A lot of people are watching to see where she stuck her toe in the water in a pretty bold way.
[00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.600]  And we're going to see what happens here.
[00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.241]  We need to support her.
[00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:37.922]  This is destiny here.
[00:03:38.382 --> 00:03:44.285]  And we need to go up to the new website that we have started.
[00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.492]  And you need to go up to the supportrosie.com.
[00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:53.095]  We have links to it up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:56.757]  Go up there, link over to the site, and then send an email.
[00:03:57.218 --> 00:03:58.018]  Email everybody.
[00:03:58.058 --> 00:04:01.821]  Go to every message board and post it and tell them, sign the petition.
[00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:04.883]  We're going to physically have it registered, mailed.
[00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:11.087]  Just at the end of this week, we'll send the first 10,000, 20,000, whatever we've got over to them.
[00:04:11.107 --> 00:04:13.609]  We're going to email it to them as well on the site.
[00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:14.470]  There's a place where you can
[00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.552]  Contact and email ABC.
[00:04:16.652 --> 00:04:17.933]  Phone numbers to ABC.
[00:04:18.293 --> 00:04:19.495]  ABC message boards.
[00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:21.176]  Because this is important.
[00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:25.901]  O'Reilly and Fox News and CNN and they're all doing it.
[00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:29.044]  I mean now even mainline CNN are saying she needs to be fired.
[00:04:29.304 --> 00:04:30.185]  Everybody hates her.
[00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:31.466]  She needs to be shut down.
[00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:32.507]  That's not the case.
[00:04:32.888 --> 00:04:34.509]  But they're trying to create that illusion.
[00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.873]  And so you need to go over to the new website we've launched.
[00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:39.274]  We've gotten up.
[00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:49.785]  Hell, we could just put an email up there and you can just email us your email in support of our petition and we'll forward that.
[00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:52.207]  I mean, we'll get this done by hook or by crook.
[00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:54.430]  We will use carrier pigeon if need be.
[00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:08.579]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:16.544]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:24.319]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:36.144]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:40.386]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.347]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:42.687 --> 00:05:46.529]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:54.580]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:04.747]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:04.807 --> 00:06:12.109]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:22.872]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:06:23.093 --> 00:06:27.634]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:27.914 --> 00:06:32.920]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.064]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:36.284 --> 00:06:46.115]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:06:46.175 --> 00:06:51.018]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.118 --> 00:06:53.139]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at perkywater.com.
[00:07:00.842 --> 00:07:03.403]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:03.563 --> 00:07:05.724]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:16.110]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.731]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:23.012]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[00:07:23.212 --> 00:07:28.913]  They're all natural, they're triple concentrated, they're factory direct, factory owned and operated since 1947.

[00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.642]  Call today for a Calvin Soap catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:57.608]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at calvinpuresoap.com.
[00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:07.056]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:10.659]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:15.764]  DefendRosie.com is the new website.
[00:08:15.804 --> 00:08:25.271]  DefendRosie.com It says on the page there's close to 2,000 signatures since this went up late last night.
[00:08:27.353 --> 00:08:40.363]  We got the idea after the show yesterday to do this and we used another message board system to embed it to do it to be quick and the cheesy company doesn't like it when you get thousands of postings
[00:08:41.132 --> 00:08:47.177]  And so, we had to go in there and retrieve the signatures, and right now the signature system is shut down.
[00:08:47.557 --> 00:08:52.782]  If we have to, we'll go to you just sending us emails and we'll post those there onto the site.
[00:08:53.302 --> 00:09:06.313]  Because this has to move quick, we need to be able to go and say, we got 10,000 emails, 10,000 people signing the petition, and it says when you sign onto there that you support her right to free speech.
[00:09:07.217 --> 00:09:08.838]  Uh, and that she shouldn't be fired.
[00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:13.202]  We need to be able to say, in less than 24 hours, we got 10,000 signatures.
[00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:24.150]  Which would be absolutely no problem, but, you know, stupid technology glitches, which we're trying to get deeper and deeper into to get more resilient and to be able to do things ourselves, I guess.
[00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:26.372]  But we're working on it.
[00:09:26.412 --> 00:09:27.513]  Folks are doing a good job there.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.142]  Just get it out to everybody right now.
[00:09:31.282 --> 00:09:33.164]  DefendRosie.com.
[00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:37.889]  If you forget the URL, we've got links up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.334]  We've got links up on InfoWars.com directly to the new site.
[00:09:43.735 --> 00:09:49.741]  It has places where you can link through to Rosie O'Donnell's subpage and support her there on her blog.
[00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:51.342]  It's got links to the ABC.
[00:09:52.323 --> 00:09:53.024]  We're good to go.
[00:10:16.238 --> 00:10:19.823]  Literally, we've got like eight TV clips from yesterday.
[00:10:19.983 --> 00:10:22.226]  We might play one or two today.
[00:10:22.306 --> 00:10:23.968]  We just can't spend all day on this.
[00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:25.670]  We've got geopolitical news.
[00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.912]  We've got economic news.
[00:10:26.932 --> 00:10:27.933]  I want to take your calls.
[00:10:28.214 --> 00:10:29.675]  We've got a bunch of 9-11 news.
[00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:33.921]  But they're trying to set the precedent to shut down free speech.
[00:10:34.804 --> 00:10:44.913]  They're desperately trying to set the precedent to fire her, to create a chilling effect, to shut down everybody else that might defend her.
[00:10:45.213 --> 00:10:48.076]  So the best thing to do is to go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:48.136 --> 00:10:49.938]  Help us in this info war.
[00:10:50.178 --> 00:10:51.679]  This is a key battle right now.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.242]  Go get the story that Paul Watson has written.
[00:10:54.522 --> 00:10:57.144]  Help defend Rosie and save free speech in America.
[00:10:57.585 --> 00:10:59.046]  Sign the petition.
[00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:04.078]  So, you know, at least people will see the petition and know the fight's going on.
[00:11:04.338 --> 00:11:12.663]  Go ahead and get the article out to everybody and hopefully we'll get some type of message board up there on the site.
[00:11:12.703 --> 00:11:20.688]  I mean, again, we had it and it was working and then the stupid thing just won't take all those signatures and Lord knows why.
[00:11:21.189 --> 00:11:26.492]  We're going to figure out message boards and we're going to have big message boards on our sites in the near future.
[00:11:26.872 --> 00:11:28.754]  In the past, they just descended into such
[00:11:30.974 --> 00:11:36.136]  Mindless trolling and disinfo that we had one and we shut it down, but I don't even care.
[00:11:36.176 --> 00:11:37.356]  I'm just going to set up a big one.
[00:11:37.736 --> 00:11:52.942]  We're going to pick some good moderators, and as long as it isn't just total slander, or this person's got cocaine in their house, or that person's a such and such, it's going to be free speech on them, and we're going to have big message boards on Prison Planet and InfoWars.
[00:11:53.542 --> 00:11:59.625]  I don't know why we send a dig and why we send a halo scan as much traffic as Prison Planet gets.
[00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:00.546]  I don't know why we don't.
[00:12:01.006 --> 00:12:03.267]  But we're going to have that on the sites.
[00:12:03.668 --> 00:12:13.993]  You can absolutely put that in the bank and know that because I'm tired of relying on other places and other organizations and other groups.
[00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:16.115]  I'm just busy trying to make a film.
[00:12:16.615 --> 00:12:20.297]  I apologize for not having this done correctly, but it's not our fault.
[00:12:20.857 --> 00:12:21.798]  Just the way things work.
[00:12:22.138 --> 00:12:27.101]  I was up here until 1.30 last night working on the new film, End Game, and we're just trying to grow.
[00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:28.322]  We're trying to do a better job.
[00:12:28.662 --> 00:12:41.730]  That's why it's important that you buy the books and videos that we carry and the films I've made off the Secure Online Video and Bookstore at InfoWars.com because that's how we fund what we're doing and how we have enough personnel to be able to get the job done.
[00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:46.493]  Alright, let me just go ahead and read this article Paul Watson wrote.
[00:12:47.242 --> 00:12:50.024]  Help defend Rosie and save free speech in America.
[00:12:50.504 --> 00:13:05.652]  Rosie O'Donnell has been savagely attacked by talking heads on major news networks and others simply for exercising her First Amendment right to ask questions about 9-11, questions that are shared by the majority of family members of the victims.
[00:13:06.112 --> 00:13:13.676]  A relentless campaign on behalf of the anti-American haters of free speech is underway to force ABC to fire O'Donnell
[00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:18.035]  From her position as a host on The View with 30 million viewers.
[00:13:18.796 --> 00:13:34.508]  The petition was created to show that a significant and vocal number of Americans recognize and support Rosie O'Donnell's stance in displaying the highest form of patriotism, asking questions of government and demanding the truth about what really happened on September 11th.
[00:13:34.988 --> 00:13:36.189]  Sign the petition now.
[00:13:36.309 --> 00:13:36.929]  Click here.
[00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.392]  And when that rocket's ready to lift off, you can go do that.
[00:13:41.275 --> 00:13:47.762]  And it continues, calls for Rosie to be fired, censored, and in one case, even executed.
[00:13:47.822 --> 00:13:51.845]  That's right, they're calling for her murder on television now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:53.087 --> 00:13:54.308]  They're calling for her death.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:07.466]  Calls for Rosie to be fired, censored, and in one case, even executed, came after Rosie simply raised the question of what caused WTC Building 7 to collapse on September 11th.
[00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:21.593]  WTC 7 was a 47-story building in the WTC complex that was not hit by a plane, yet collapsed in a perfect, symmetrical implosion at free-fall speed in the late afternoon of September 11th.
[00:14:23.018 --> 00:14:35.783]  If the collapse of the building was an accident, why were Ground Zero personnel, firefighters, and police told to vacate the area surrounding Building 7 in advance because the structure was, quote, going to be brought down?
[00:14:36.203 --> 00:14:47.988]  If the collapse did not involve the use of demolition charges, why did NYPD officer Craig Bartmer report bombs, and I've interviewed him personally, face-to-face, tearing down the building as he ran away from it?
[00:14:48.348 --> 00:14:59.053]  Why did WTC Complex leaseholder Larry Silverstein admit on a 2002 PBS documentary that WTC7 was deliberately pulled to pull as industry jargon for controlled demolition?
[00:14:59.374 --> 00:15:04.476]  Why was NIST changed its explanation for the collapse of Building 7 on several different occasions?
[00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:08.258]  And why to this day has it still not come to a conclusion?
[00:15:08.798 --> 00:15:22.207]  How can fire damage have caused the building, which has been structurally reinforced, to collapse and free fall when photos taken immediately before it fell show limited fires confined sporadically to just eight floors?
[00:15:22.687 --> 00:15:25.089]  And now they claim that a third of the building or something was knocked off.
[00:15:25.109 --> 00:15:25.769]  That's a total lie.
[00:15:25.789 --> 00:15:27.591]  They show another building's photo.
[00:15:27.611 --> 00:15:28.631]  We've caught them doing that.
[00:15:28.892 --> 00:15:29.972]  You show the actual damage.
[00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.394]  It's just a little corner has been bashed.
[00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:41.747]  Why did the news networks let CNN and BBC report the collapse of WTC7 over 20 minutes before the building actually fell?
[00:15:42.128 --> 00:15:59.035]  Why are news networks like Fox, CNN and MSNBC so eager to throw out ad hominem insults and employ smear tactics against Rosie O'Donnell simply for raising these kinds of questions, yet universally refuse to debate the cold, hard facts surrounding Building 7?
[00:15:59.995 --> 00:16:06.020]  Why are enemies of free speech attempting to have Rosie O'Donnell thrown off the air simply for discussing the issue?
[00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:16.109]  Show your support for Rosie's stance, for the survival of free speech in America, and for a full investigation of what really happened on 9-11 by signing the petition.
[00:16:16.369 --> 00:16:27.919]  Send a message to those that wish to create a chilling atmosphere of intimidation that their anti-American assault on the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment will be repelled by a substantial and sustained counterattack.
[00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:29.119]  And you know what?
[00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:30.320]  Just go to ABC.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:36.643]  Go to the website that we set up, DefendRosie.com and just it says contact ABC.
[00:16:36.843 --> 00:16:37.443]  Hit them there.
[00:16:37.783 --> 00:16:38.363]  Hit them there.
[00:16:38.423 --> 00:16:38.944]  That's up.
[00:16:38.984 --> 00:16:39.904]  You can hit them there.
[00:16:40.264 --> 00:16:45.807]  Go right there and send them emails and tell them we know it's an inside job.
[00:16:45.907 --> 00:16:47.687]  You can't stop the truth from coming out.
[00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:50.769]  84% in major polls believe that there's a cover-up of 9-11.
[00:16:50.789 --> 00:16:52.550]  36% are willing to say total inside job and
[00:16:56.477 --> 00:17:02.639]  We are going to boycott Disney if you fire her, because that's what they're saying on CNN, on Fox, on MSNBC.
[00:17:02.659 --> 00:17:04.459]  They're saying, don't go to Disney World.
[00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:11.041]  Don't worry, I won't anyway, because they RFID you with a bracelet and thumb scan you to get in.
[00:17:11.581 --> 00:17:12.701]  Total brainwashing.
[00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:20.283]  But tell them, I'm not taking my children, I'm not going to Disneyland in California, or Disney World in Orlando, Florida.
[00:17:21.397 --> 00:17:28.542]  If you're over in France, tell them you're not going to their Disney Europe, that monstrosity, or Disney Japan, or wherever you're at.
[00:17:28.842 --> 00:17:39.849]  You call them, you let them know, you let those corporates know that, and you call them to these talk radio shows, and you don't let them... Blacklist 9-11 Truth.
[00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.210]  Let me tell you how important this is.
[00:17:41.631 --> 00:17:43.452]  Bush is going to leave office in a year and a half.
[00:17:44.486 --> 00:18:03.202]  A lot of 9-11 truth momentum will be dampened at that time, because it'll be seen that he's gone, Hillary will be in, or Chuck Hagel, or some other monster, who of course are all part of the same New World Order system, and it'll just keep moving forward, and still it'll be a big movement, and we can never stop it.
[00:18:03.222 --> 00:18:04.964]  9-11 truth, as I've said, is the key.
[00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:12.347]  Because it takes their tool of false flag terror away, and it shows just how ruthless and criminal these individuals are.
[00:18:12.627 --> 00:18:23.672]  If we don't take 9-11 away from them, that they use to pose as saviors, that they use to pose as the good guys and the heroes, if we don't do that, they're going to use it to kill America!
[00:18:24.412 --> 00:18:41.495]  Either 9-11 is going to be a dagger to be plunged into the heart of America, or it is going to literally be something that saves this country and backfires on the New World Order and becomes a shield and a sword for the Republic to rise against the New World Order.
[00:18:42.285 --> 00:18:43.728]  Okay, that's the bottom line.
[00:18:43.768 --> 00:18:44.369]  And they know that.
[00:18:44.409 --> 00:18:49.157]  They said it's the foundational, catalyzing event of the New World Order.
[00:18:49.278 --> 00:18:51.802]  We must attack the fraud.
[00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:54.888]  We must attack this cult-like religion.
[00:18:55.552 --> 00:19:09.019]  That is based on nothing but lies we have got to do it and right now the frontline fight right now the most important fight is this Rosie O'Donnell issue in this theater of the fight on 9-11.
[00:19:09.079 --> 00:19:14.942]  You know we have a clip coming up later and she says, GD I don't think I'm going to play it.
[00:19:15.302 --> 00:19:16.883]  It's in a video clip that's up on
[00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:20.312]  It should be up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:19:20.332 --> 00:19:22.893]  I've been requesting it go up since yesterday and it should be up there.
[00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:25.674]  Amazing, amazing piece put together.
[00:19:26.735 --> 00:19:33.618]  And the mother shows the picture of her daughter who died on 9-11 and he says, President Bush took my daughter and used her name for his war.
[00:19:33.818 --> 00:19:36.299]  And that's exactly what we're doing.
[00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:37.059]  You understand?
[00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:38.480]  They don't just kill us.
[00:19:39.401 --> 00:19:46.086]  They take the names of those they killed, and they take them unto themselves, and they say all the evil they're doing is in their name!
[00:19:46.506 --> 00:19:47.046]  Can you imagine?
[00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:51.049]  They murder them, and then murder others in the name of those they've murdered!
[00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.471]  This is too unbelievable!
[00:19:53.811 --> 00:19:54.552]  It's too evil!
[00:19:54.852 --> 00:19:55.672]  Well, they're right back!
[00:19:55.692 --> 00:19:56.133]  Stay with me!
[00:19:59.966 --> 00:20:02.027]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:02.647 --> 00:20:11.589]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:12.009 --> 00:20:19.211]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:19.944 --> 00:20:25.450]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:36.761]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:37.522 --> 00:20:39.524]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:40.084 --> 00:20:44.385]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:20:44.465 --> 00:20:49.046]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:20:49.146 --> 00:20:54.307]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists
[00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:11.332]  We're good to go.
[00:21:37.532 --> 00:21:42.277]  Get the facts and call Midas Resources toll free at 888-292-2709.
[00:21:42.537 --> 00:21:46.381]  That's 888-292-2709.
[00:21:46.621 --> 00:21:51.967]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty silver half dollar.
[00:21:59.002 --> 00:22:07.249]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:22:07.509 --> 00:22:11.872]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:22:12.153 --> 00:22:21.080]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.903]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[00:22:25.183 --> 00:22:30.229]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:37.258]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:22:37.739 --> 00:22:38.279]  What about you?
[00:22:39.028 --> 00:22:43.930]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:44.390]  A $14 savings.
[00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.590]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.491]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:22:59.372 --> 00:23:05.878]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:23:06.098 --> 00:23:10.122]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:23:10.382 --> 00:23:12.524]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:23:12.885 --> 00:23:19.851]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:23:20.211 --> 00:23:22.834]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:23:23.094 --> 00:23:26.618]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:23:26.878 --> 00:23:29.801]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:34.746]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:23:35.166 --> 00:23:36.648]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:23:36.928 --> 00:23:39.411]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X.
[00:23:40.592 --> 00:23:41.292]  Alright, here's the deal.
[00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:14.410]  You're going to continue to be able to sign the petition, but we're going to launch a new petition system sometime today.
[00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:26.840]  So we'll take all the old signatures, transform them into another format, have those posted at DefendRosie.com and then you'll just have the new petition system and we'll just put those two numbers together.
[00:24:27.421 --> 00:24:31.324]  Tomorrow I'm going to shoot a video here in studio with the thousands of petitions in my hand.
[00:24:31.344 --> 00:24:35.447]  I'm going to print them off and I'm going to put a YouTube out saying here are the thousands of petitions.
[00:24:36.328 --> 00:24:37.189]  Those little snakes
[00:24:38.177 --> 00:24:48.403]  Those little neocon snakes who after two days of Fox News promoting their anti-Rosie website, FireRosie, only had a few thousand signatures.
[00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:52.725]  And when you go look, you can't put a comment like you can on ours.
[00:24:53.386 --> 00:24:54.506]  It's just a
[00:24:57.561 --> 00:25:02.525]  Name, but it'll be like Ronald McDonald or Rosie Rules or Inside Job.
[00:25:03.646 --> 00:25:16.037]  Most of the people on there are against them, and they're using those numbers to go all over TV going, look, we've got thousands, and they've got a stack of stuff that says Ronald McDonald and Inside Job and, you know, love Rosie.
[00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:30.056]  Okay, well you can go up to our petition, which our guys did a great job, and they built a whole website, got it launched, and counted on some, you know, I told them to use HoloScan because we were having trouble installing a message board ourselves, which we're going to do.
[00:25:30.757 --> 00:25:33.199]  So, and remember, they're updating websites while they're at it.
[00:25:33.219 --> 00:25:34.761]  They're running my IT stuff while they're at it.
[00:25:34.781 --> 00:25:35.741]  We just don't have the personnel.
[00:25:36.102 --> 00:25:37.343]  That's why you need to support us.
[00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:38.924]  That's why I should spend more time.
[00:25:39.164 --> 00:25:42.928]  I think I spent like one minute and three hours yesterday plugging my videos.
[00:25:43.795 --> 00:25:45.156]  And then I look at the bank account.
[00:25:45.196 --> 00:25:46.538]  I don't have money to hire more people.
[00:25:46.618 --> 00:25:48.339]  I don't mean to talk about this on air.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.322]  It's just that we're in an info war here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:51.622 --> 00:25:53.044]  And that's why we need your support.
[00:25:53.304 --> 00:25:56.247]  But right now, Rosie needs your support.
[00:25:56.307 --> 00:25:58.629]  Because if they're able to get her fired...
[00:25:59.412 --> 00:26:00.132]  And then spin it.
[00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:06.735]  It's going to scare, because believe me folks, they know that two weeks ago a whole bunch of high-powered Hollywood people met in secret in L.A.
[00:26:07.355 --> 00:26:10.516]  I was invited, but was given two days notice, just I didn't go.
[00:26:11.117 --> 00:26:14.538]  I probably should have, but I'm just, I'm tired, folks, and I'm, you know, I can't do everything.
[00:26:15.518 --> 00:26:21.841]  Most people would kill to be in a, you know, in a secret room in Hollywood, but the point is, is that I'm just ready for them to go public.
[00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:26.622]  When they go public, I don't care whose shows they go public on, just go public and get the word out.
[00:26:27.363 --> 00:26:27.683]  Okay?
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:35.885]  And, uh, you know, Charlie Sheen hit the barbed wire in this pop culture where that's God, where that's King, and it had a huge effect.
[00:26:36.626 --> 00:26:39.028]  You resonated with his courage.
[00:26:39.808 --> 00:26:40.849]  You picked up on that.
[00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:48.134]  Now Rosie's done it, and she's got tens of millions of women that are big fans of her.
[00:26:48.454 --> 00:26:49.795]  They're now all talking about it.
[00:26:49.815 --> 00:26:56.120]  9-11 Truth is exploding, and I'm telling you, if you really want to see George Bush arrested, and that can happen,
[00:26:56.693 --> 00:27:00.597]  You just envision that, and you move forward in the real world to take action and make sure that happens.
[00:27:00.858 --> 00:27:18.637]  If you want to see Dick Cheney arrested, if you want to see the MI6 and Mossad agents clearly involved in 9-11 arrested, if you want to see this criminal government fall, if you want to see Bill Clinton clearly involved in the setup of all of this arrested, if you want to see the Rockefellers go into prison, it can happen!
[00:27:19.611 --> 00:27:24.812]  You're already seeing a lot of them getting indicted, a lot of them, you know, on the run and in trouble and getting out of the country.
[00:27:25.153 --> 00:27:29.894]  I mean, there are already over a hundred countries that a bunch of these guys can't go to because there's indictments on them.
[00:27:30.234 --> 00:27:33.415]  Major European nations on Henry Kissinger and others.
[00:27:34.875 --> 00:27:38.976]  So, and they're not as arrogant as they were in the past now.
[00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:41.217]  They're beginning to realize they're in trouble.
[00:27:41.838 --> 00:27:51.742]  But I'm telling you, we've got to grow exponentially 9-11 Truth now, in the year and a half we've got, before George Bush leaves office.
[00:27:51.822 --> 00:27:56.244]  We have got to hammer this drum like we never have.
[00:27:57.165 --> 00:27:59.405]  There's a great organization that I've learned of,
[00:28:00.826 --> 00:28:02.207]  I believe it's called the 11th day.
[00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:03.507]  We're every 11th day of the month.
[00:28:03.568 --> 00:28:07.289]  I know they've been having that here in Austin for about a year on the 11th day of the month.
[00:28:07.329 --> 00:28:08.670]  I don't know if that started here.
[00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:12.232]  I know they've been doing that here, but it's a website, an organization.
[00:28:12.632 --> 00:28:17.155]  They put a great video together that I saw last night that literally brought tears to my eyes.
[00:28:17.235 --> 00:28:21.297]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:28:21.317 --> 00:28:22.457]  Get that out to everyone.
[00:28:22.497 --> 00:28:23.898]  This deserves to be seen.
[00:28:24.298 --> 00:28:25.739]  It's only three and a half minutes long.
[00:28:26.339 --> 00:28:29.481]  It literally says it all in that three and a half minutes.
[00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.752]  We are going to win this fight with God's help and with you taking action.
[00:28:35.532 --> 00:28:57.501]  And this is so important right now that everybody go to DefendRosie.com, that you get that URL, that you get it out to everyone, that you sign the petition, and that you also contact ABC and you tell them, look, we know your military industrial complex, we understand that, but understand this, we will never go to your Disney World
[00:28:59.402 --> 00:29:00.083]  We're good to go.
[00:29:16.653 --> 00:29:20.714]  Of the top five people in Hollywood, three of them are 9-11 truthers.
[00:29:21.555 --> 00:29:27.536]  I have directly talked to two of them and know a high-level associate of the third.
[00:29:28.277 --> 00:29:34.358]  Of the biggest five, three of them constantly are obsessed with 9-11 truth.
[00:29:35.319 --> 00:29:38.480]  One of them has known since days after 9-11 happened.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.340]  Okay?
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.981]  We need them to go public.
[00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:42.981]  And Rosie is a test case.
[00:29:43.641 --> 00:29:45.202]  We'll be right back, get into other news.
[00:29:45.222 --> 00:29:45.662]  Stay with me.
[00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:51.981]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.904 --> 00:29:55.592]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.486 --> 00:29:59.907]  Attention!
[00:30:00.027 --> 00:30:02.829]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:30:03.129 --> 00:30:07.433]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:30:07.754 --> 00:30:08.434]  Listen closely.
[00:30:09.075 --> 00:30:16.561]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:30:16.862 --> 00:30:22.667]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis.
[00:30:22.867 --> 00:30:23.367]  We're good to go.
[00:30:43.712 --> 00:30:46.997]  If you're a customer, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:30:47.197 --> 00:30:50.762]  Shipments will be filled on a first come, first serve basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:30:51.003 --> 00:30:54.348]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:31:00.261 --> 00:31:07.067]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[00:31:07.448 --> 00:31:13.853]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[00:31:14.333 --> 00:31:24.182]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:31.168]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness, and you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[00:31:31.788 --> 00:31:34.511]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[00:31:35.031 --> 00:31:39.315]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[00:31:39.355 --> 00:31:43.658]  Box 969 Soquel, S.O.Q.U.E.L., California, 95073,
[00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:48.906]  $32 to Radio Liberty, Box 969, Soquel, CA 95073 or call 1-800-544-8927 1-800-544-8927
[00:31:59.204 --> 00:32:01.846]  Is your child disrespectful, defiant, or obnoxious?
[00:32:02.186 --> 00:32:04.368]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?
[00:32:04.688 --> 00:32:06.390]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman.
[00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.773]  I'll help you turn your child's behavior around right now with the Total Transformation.
[00:32:11.254 --> 00:32:16.158]  After the Total Transformation, there's no more arguing, no more lecturing, no more backtalking.
[00:32:16.538 --> 00:32:18.439]  Now when I ask him to do something, he does it.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:23.944]  We've learned verbiage from the Total Transformation program, and it's almost like magic.
[00:32:24.284 --> 00:32:26.705]  If you say those words, they stop arguing.
[00:32:26.785 --> 00:32:32.068]  Defiant, back-talking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[00:32:32.288 --> 00:32:35.790]  The Total Transformation will help you solve even the worst behavior problems.
[00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:40.692]  I guarantee your child will listen to you again and you get peace and sanity back in your home.

[00:32:45.374 --> 00:32:45.835]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 Call now.
[00:32:45.855 --> 00:32:45.915]  1-800-373-0402
[00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:53.439]  We're good to go.
[00:33:38.846 --> 00:33:45.968]  These things, the good things that have been done, the reforms that have been made, the wars that have been stopped, was not done by government edict.
[00:33:46.248 --> 00:33:48.909]  It was not done by the three branches of government.
[00:33:49.049 --> 00:33:54.631]  It was not done by that structure called Orlando Junior High School, which they say is democracy.
[00:33:54.851 --> 00:33:56.952]  It was all done by citizens' movements.
[00:33:56.972 --> 00:34:05.855]  And then keep in mind that great movements in the past have risen from small movements, from these tiny clusters of people that have gotten together here today.
[00:34:06.415 --> 00:34:10.057]  What really matters is what are people doing?
[00:34:10.177 --> 00:34:12.299]  What are people saying?
[00:34:12.339 --> 00:34:18.142]  What are people doing?
[00:34:18.883 --> 00:34:21.744]  We're happy to see you and all your penile guys doing the perp walk.
[00:34:22.165 --> 00:34:22.365]  Perp.
[00:34:22.805 --> 00:34:24.226]  You're in discretion with 9-11.
[00:34:24.346 --> 00:34:25.747]  We know that y'all get it.
[00:35:11.097 --> 00:35:17.658]  Again, folks, it is a hundred times more powerful when you actually go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:17.678 --> 00:35:22.379]  This is the most powerful, short 9-11 truth piece I've ever seen.
[00:35:23.499 --> 00:35:30.761]  I mean, you've got to, that's only about half of it, you've got to go up to PrisonPlanet.com right now and we have it posted
[00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:36.538]  And get this video clip and get it out to everybody because it says it all.
[00:35:37.338 --> 00:35:50.582]  And I tell you, when it shows that Iraqi woman with her son dying in her arms, and you can just see how she lovingly, she's very calm, she just puts her head down and puts her cheek up against his after he's been cluster bombed.
[00:35:50.602 --> 00:35:52.763]  I mean, it made me cry last night.
[00:35:53.803 --> 00:35:55.664]  And I literally watched this clip like ten times.
[00:35:55.984 --> 00:35:58.645]  I just, it is so well done and I
[00:36:00.687 --> 00:36:02.293]  I am so thankful.
[00:36:03.518 --> 00:36:04.883]  I am so honored.
[00:36:05.782 --> 00:36:07.783]  That I woke up to the New World Order.
[00:36:07.803 --> 00:36:15.565]  I am humbled that I know about the New World Order, that I learned about it, and that I stood up and fought it, and that I have had some effect.
[00:36:15.645 --> 00:36:22.526]  I know I'm not the best at what I do, but at least I'm in the fight, and you're in the fight, and I feel this sense of kinship with you.
[00:36:22.546 --> 00:36:29.928]  I feel this sense of brotherhood and sisterhood, and that we're all together.
[00:36:30.068 --> 00:36:32.929]  I can feel your strength.
[00:36:33.946 --> 00:36:45.104]  I can feel the power of humanity, led by God's Holy Spirit, literally rising against the darkness of the New World Order.
[00:36:45.968 --> 00:37:05.557]  And just to be able to have this sense of true belonging with a real community of loving, intelligent, involved, compassionate, engaged people is the most valuable and precious and wonderful thing in my life, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:06.358 --> 00:37:10.640]  I mean, the feeling of love that I only have for my children
[00:37:11.648 --> 00:37:13.549]  I now feel that love for you.
[00:37:13.569 --> 00:37:15.611]  It is so amazing.
[00:37:15.711 --> 00:37:17.432]  We are family.
[00:37:18.432 --> 00:37:22.875]  We are brothers and sisters, and I love you.
[00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:25.397]  I love your courage.
[00:37:25.617 --> 00:37:27.058]  I love your honor.
[00:37:27.238 --> 00:37:28.599]  I love your strength.
[00:37:29.019 --> 00:37:38.225]  I love the art you produce, and the things you do, and the courage you've shown, and the things you've stood up against, and the miles you've walked.
[00:37:39.276 --> 00:37:43.079]  I just am one with you, and I can feel your spirit.
[00:37:43.799 --> 00:37:45.220]  We are together.
[00:37:46.321 --> 00:37:48.663]  This is so wonderful.
[00:37:50.024 --> 00:37:58.550]  And I tell you right now, folks, I know things now about Rosie O'Donnell, and as I've said, she's been silly and ignorant in the past, but she's got guts, and guts is enough.
[00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:06.936]  And I didn't, somebody was trying to contact me for two weeks, who'd met with her, and had talked with her, and had been to her house, and had dinner with her, and
[00:38:07.759 --> 00:38:15.106]  I was so busy I didn't get in contact with them and they sent me the photographs and the information and they told me what I already knew by looking in her eyes.
[00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:18.269]  I mean Rosie O'Donnell has been crying.
[00:38:18.369 --> 00:38:19.450]  She is freaked out.
[00:38:20.377 --> 00:38:24.238]  She doesn't even know whether she should basically stay in this country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:24.578 --> 00:38:26.539]  It has totally blown her worldview.
[00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:28.499]  It's not liberal or conservative anymore.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.500]  She's come face-to-face with the new old order.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:36.962]  She's been hit by a thunderbolt and knocked off her horse, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:38:37.542 --> 00:38:39.943]  And that's going to happen to more and more people!
[00:38:40.783 --> 00:38:45.488]  And they can kill some of us, and they can ruin some of us, but they can't kill the truth!
[00:38:45.768 --> 00:38:47.329]  And they can't kill ideas!
[00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:54.296]  And they can't kill the love we've got for humanity and the children being killed by this New World Order!
[00:38:54.657 --> 00:38:57.019]  And we stand against the New World Order!
[00:38:57.299 --> 00:38:59.942]  And we're going to defeat the New World Order!
[00:39:02.834 --> 00:39:06.217]  I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, we are part of history.
[00:39:06.517 --> 00:39:08.659]  We have now stepped into the flow of history.
[00:39:08.859 --> 00:39:10.501]  We are now actors in history.
[00:39:10.701 --> 00:39:14.524]  We are not on the sideline like Karl Rove told the New York Times.
[00:39:14.784 --> 00:39:17.046]  He said, America and the world mean nothing.
[00:39:18.247 --> 00:39:19.548]  He said, none of you count.
[00:39:19.648 --> 00:39:20.609]  We run everything.
[00:39:20.909 --> 00:39:21.970]  We control history.
[00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.311]  No, you don't!
[00:39:27.344 --> 00:39:39.076]  And you do not expropriate and take the names of the dead women and children and men that you killed on 9-11 and take them under your evil and use their strength for your power!
[00:39:39.817 --> 00:39:41.198]  We take it back from you!
[00:39:41.218 --> 00:39:42.780]  And you do not
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:58.670]  Take the name of America and our soldiers that you put in harm's way and die, and you do not take the reflected glory, and you do not take the reflected honor, and the reflected courage of those people who do believe they're fighting for America, and take it unto yourself.
[00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.951]  You do not take their names anymore!
[00:40:01.892 --> 00:40:03.953]  You do not do this in our names anymore!
[00:40:03.993 --> 00:40:05.875]  You do not do this in our names anymore!
[00:40:06.155 --> 00:40:10.518]  You do not do this in America, in the United States' name anymore!
[00:40:11.735 --> 00:40:16.199]  We need to rebuke these devils, rebuke the New World Order, and stand against them!
[00:40:22.964 --> 00:40:25.106]  Alright, we have him scheduled for the next five minutes.
[00:40:26.627 --> 00:40:28.789]  It's very important to take action in this fight.
[00:40:29.289 --> 00:40:34.454]  It's important to have firearms and ammunition, have them properly stowed, know how to properly use them.
[00:40:34.474 --> 00:40:35.815]  I don't want you buying guns.
[00:40:37.483 --> 00:40:42.047]  Unless you go out, and if you weren't raised with them especially, you need to go out and take five, ten lessons.
[00:40:42.507 --> 00:40:44.869]  You need to know how to use that handgun or shotgun or rifle.
[00:40:45.529 --> 00:40:47.130]  You need to practice with it.
[00:40:48.091 --> 00:40:48.972]  But you need to have it.
[00:40:49.012 --> 00:40:50.012]  You need to have guns.
[00:40:50.032 --> 00:40:51.073]  You need to have ammunition.
[00:40:51.113 --> 00:40:52.334]  You need to have storable foods.
[00:40:52.735 --> 00:40:55.837]  And ladies and gentlemen, you need to have water filtration systems.
[00:40:56.217 --> 00:40:57.158]  And you need to be ready.
[00:40:58.493 --> 00:41:01.696]  Okay, because God knows what these killers are going to do.
[00:41:01.816 --> 00:41:08.481]  I mean, the CFR that of course told you about the 9-11 attacks and said get ready for them, they're saying we will be nuked, all this stuff will happen.
[00:41:08.601 --> 00:41:09.302]  I don't know, folks.
[00:41:09.562 --> 00:41:11.444]  I just know these criminals are capable of anything.
[00:41:11.884 --> 00:41:15.487]  And we do have a sponsor coming up with us, Adam Locke from New Millennium Concepts.
[00:41:15.547 --> 00:41:17.769]  And Adam, it's great to have you with us today.
[00:41:18.129 --> 00:41:19.130]  People need to get prepared.
[00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:19.831]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:41:20.624 --> 00:41:21.706]  Alex, thank you.
[00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:23.288]  Always a pleasure to be on your show.
[00:41:23.348 --> 00:41:28.495]  We certainly appreciate you allowing us a little bit of time to talk about water and what's going on with water and why.
[00:41:29.403 --> 00:41:32.844]  You really should consider a water filtration and purification system.
[00:41:33.205 --> 00:41:37.226]  And it's not just what's coming up, it's what's currently going on in the water too.
[00:41:37.966 --> 00:41:42.308]  Water in the News, I love talking about this stuff because it's here, it's happening now.
[00:41:42.808 --> 00:41:53.913]  In England, for example, water customers are going to have to foot the bill for a two billion pound super sewer system to stop the sewage from ending up in their wonderful Thames River.
[00:41:54.907 --> 00:41:59.370]  The 20-mile tunnel that they're going to build is going to catch raw sewage and rainwater discharge.
[00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:03.192]  This stuff is spewing into the river anytime they have a heavy rainfall.
[00:42:03.693 --> 00:42:09.216]  Estimated 32 million tons a year overflows into that river alone.
[00:42:11.517 --> 00:42:12.218]  Albany, New York.
[00:42:13.268 --> 00:42:19.871]  The testing uncovers elevated lead levels in the drinking water of six Albany elementary schools.
[00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:21.611]  Of course, Alex, I'm sure you know.
[00:42:21.691 --> 00:42:26.673]  Look, the water is so dirty, I don't know how anyone out there doesn't filter it.
[00:42:27.774 --> 00:42:29.254]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:42:29.314 --> 00:42:30.815]  I use big burkeys in the office.
[00:42:31.175 --> 00:42:31.916]  I give them as gifts.
[00:42:32.236 --> 00:42:36.017]  But yesterday I had water people over, you know, putting whole filters on my entire house.
[00:42:36.357 --> 00:42:37.318]  I mean, I just spent big money.
[00:42:37.338 --> 00:42:38.618]  Folks, I believe in this.
[00:42:38.978 --> 00:42:39.719]  This is real.
[00:42:39.779 --> 00:42:42.960]  And you're nuts if you don't at least filter the water going down your gullet.
[00:42:43.945 --> 00:42:45.827]  You can't even trust the bottle of water.
[00:42:46.608 --> 00:42:53.617]  The FDA last week reissued a warning for consumers not to drink a particular brand because it has arsenic in it.
[00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:57.542]  Five separate types of this product have been recalled since March 7th.
[00:42:57.722 --> 00:42:59.404]  Even the bottle of water.
[00:43:03.675 --> 00:43:12.928]  Look, I know 95% of our audience who's educated and informed is just so in the habit of drinking tap water that they know you're telling the truth, Adam, but they're not calling.
[00:43:13.509 --> 00:43:15.752]  And folks, I mean, this is something simple.
[00:43:16.343 --> 00:43:19.405]  I mean, if not for you, yeah, the old term, and it's true, the children.
[00:43:19.825 --> 00:43:35.433]  I mean, I try to get my children to drink out of glasses, too, even when they were little, because the dioxin in the plastic, I mean, I'm sorry the world's full of all these dangers, but I'm telling you, the herbicide, the pesticide, the oil, I mean,
[00:43:37.617 --> 00:43:46.966]  I mean, Austin supposedly has good water, and I was reading, they do water testing every week here in Austin, the allowable levels in the town where I live, I mean, it is a witch's brew, Adam.
[00:43:48.407 --> 00:43:51.750]  I know, and it's all over the world, Alex, not just here in the U.S.
[00:43:52.591 --> 00:43:55.954]  The Minister for Environment, over in Ireland, throwing fits.
[00:43:56.874 --> 00:44:01.919]  They've come up with cryptosporidia contamination in the water there, in Galway, 125 people hit,
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.781]  90,000 potential homes and businesses at risk.
[00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:10.323]  The Berkey systems are designed with simplicity in mind, Alex.
[00:44:10.343 --> 00:44:10.923]  You know that.
[00:44:11.403 --> 00:44:15.644]  It's a very, very simple point-of-use system to purify your water.
[00:44:16.185 --> 00:44:19.706]  You've got things running from one and a half up to six gallons in size.
[00:44:20.086 --> 00:44:23.627]  You can purify from 2 to 25 gallons an hour.
[00:44:23.647 --> 00:44:26.108]  So, this is what they're for.
[00:44:26.448 --> 00:44:28.589]  They're to take care of you, take care of your family.
[00:44:29.898 --> 00:44:35.386]  Now, I buy the extra filter, because it cuts out all the bacteria, everything down to non-detectable levels.
[00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:38.089]  I mean, this is a new standard with electron microscopes.
[00:44:38.189 --> 00:44:42.135]  But, one thing, fluoride is so small, it even goes through reverse osmosis.
[00:44:42.415 --> 00:44:44.137]  It even goes through these gravity systems.
[00:44:44.878 --> 00:44:47.522]  You have to get a post-filter, which we have at the warranty office.
[00:44:48.022 --> 00:44:55.425]  And then it reduces it, I'd say by 80%, where you only get a, I guess if you kept four or five gallons a day, but that should be for your drinking water.
[00:44:55.685 --> 00:44:59.286]  Now, the regular system reduces the fluoride, it just doesn't knock it all out.
[00:44:59.546 --> 00:45:00.606]  I mean, it's that hard.
[00:45:00.666 --> 00:45:08.129]  There aren't very many even on the market, and that's why I found Berkey eight, nine years ago.
[00:45:08.169 --> 00:45:11.470]  I was looking for filters that knocked out fluoride, and you were one of the few.
[00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.391]  In fact, I couldn't find any then.
[00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:14.391]  Now I think there are a couple.
[00:45:14.651 --> 00:45:16.492]  I mean, explain how tough fluoride is.
[00:45:17.012 --> 00:45:22.576]  The problem with fluoride and arsenic reduction is to add those into the elements, our purification element.
[00:45:22.616 --> 00:45:24.237]  It would make them unwieldy inside.
[00:45:24.257 --> 00:45:25.518]  They'd just be simply too big.
[00:45:26.038 --> 00:45:32.922]  So we had to come up with something, and it's a post-reduction filter as you said, that attaches to the bottom of the purification element.
[00:45:33.483 --> 00:45:38.166]  And even in that, it's only going to run six months before the media inside it has expired.
[00:45:38.546 --> 00:45:40.087]  Fluoride and arsenic is some nasty stuff.
[00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.616]  You're literally dealing with a chemical weapon attack by the New World Order, folks, and I'm sorry, that's what it takes.
[00:45:47.337 --> 00:45:53.004]  And, uh, I mean, I love my children, so I go through this regimen, and my children look better than all the other children.
[00:45:53.245 --> 00:45:56.329]  Their eyes literally burn with electric, uh, life force.
[00:45:56.949 --> 00:45:59.553]  The other kids are zombie, you know, children, most of them.
[00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:14.461]  I mean, this is what it takes to not let them put the fluoride in that attacks the key pituitary and other glands that are literally, as scientists have said, are the glands associated with the soul.
[00:46:15.141 --> 00:46:16.704]  And, uh, this is a new old order, folks.
[00:46:16.744 --> 00:46:26.396]  They traffic in the souls of men, as Revelation says, and I don't know why you drink fluoride when Pulitzer Prize winning books on World War II say that Hitler used it in the camps.
[00:46:26.637 --> 00:46:27.979]  That is a historical fact.
[00:46:28.199 --> 00:46:31.183]  I don't care how many Dr. Strangelove movies say we're kooks, Adam.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.845]  Well, you know, fluoride is not allowed in the water in many European countries.
[00:46:36.166 --> 00:46:40.071]  That's a socialized health system, and the government would have to pay for the health problem, so they're not going to.
[00:46:40.091 --> 00:46:46.520]  Further, you know, it's used in aggressive bulls to calm them down, and it's a transgenerational contaminant.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.602]  It's a moving target.
[00:46:50.094 --> 00:46:51.716]  That's right, it passes on.
[00:46:52.297 --> 00:46:55.341]  It's one of the few things that passes through the placenta into the fetus.
[00:46:55.401 --> 00:46:56.682]  It's absolutely wicked!
[00:46:57.263 --> 00:47:06.134]  And of course, my parents didn't know this when I was growing up, so I did pass on some fluoride to my children, but at least they're not getting all the continual contamination.
[00:47:06.474 --> 00:47:07.496]  Here is the number.
[00:47:08.676 --> 00:47:26.301]  888-803-4438, 888-803-4438, or Berkeywater.com, and in the comments section, tell them it's an Alex Jones special to get discounted prices and free gifts like free filtration sports bottles, potassium iodate, shelter-in-place DVD films,
[00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:29.124]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Berkeywater.com.
[00:47:29.144 --> 00:47:33.628]  You can link through at the banner on InfoWars.com or order on the shopping cart of InfoWars.com.
[00:47:33.668 --> 00:47:36.751]  We fax the orders over daily at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:38.793]  Just tell them it's an Alex Jones special, 888-803-4438.
[00:47:38.973 --> 00:47:41.216]  Adam Locke, thanks for joining us.
[00:47:43.738 --> 00:47:44.959]  Alex, thank you, always a pleasure.
[00:47:45.019 --> 00:47:46.080]  It's always great to have you on.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:50.404]  We have him on at least once a week now because I haven't had Debbie on in like a month and I said, what am I doing?
[00:47:50.424 --> 00:47:51.985]  Why aren't I promoting water more?
[00:47:52.385 --> 00:47:55.428]  It supports the show, it's a sponsor, and it's something we can do.
[00:47:55.448 --> 00:48:06.557]  I mean, it's something concrete because a few weeks ago I started getting madder and madder just thinking about how they put stuff in our water, how they put it in our air, how they're just a bunch of scum!
[00:48:06.637 --> 00:48:09.820]  And I'll tell you what really made me refocus on this
[00:48:10.968 --> 00:48:12.969]  I'm doing all this eugenics research for the new film.
[00:48:13.369 --> 00:48:14.629]  And the problem is, there's too much evidence.
[00:48:14.649 --> 00:48:16.490]  I mean, now I'm thinking about making a three-part series.
[00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:22.532]  I was going to put it all in Endgame, and now I'm trying to think of, you know, giving it a sub-headline, and, you know, part one in the series.
[00:48:22.592 --> 00:48:24.713]  Because, huh, I could make a whole film.
[00:48:25.353 --> 00:48:27.334]  I could make ten films on eugenics alone.
[00:48:27.374 --> 00:48:29.915]  This is a film that just one-third of the film is about eugenics.
[00:48:30.515 --> 00:48:32.475]  And I mean, too much evidence.
[00:48:33.196 --> 00:48:39.418]  Folks, I'm reading stuff where they're openly talking about how they were going to poison you, and vaccinate you, and dumb you down with chemicals.
[00:48:40.763 --> 00:48:45.308]  Now I'm reading the stuff that Aldous Huxley wrote, and that's why he wrote the book in the 30s.
[00:48:45.368 --> 00:48:55.678]  In 33, he wrote a book about genetic engineering and dumbing people down at birth or in the womb, and then he gave a speech in 62 before he died at Berkeley saying this is the real government plan.
[00:48:56.718 --> 00:48:57.658]  I'm just warning you about it.
[00:48:57.678 --> 00:48:59.019]  I've been in the government facilities.
[00:48:59.059 --> 00:49:01.680]  His brother, of course, ran the UN's program on this.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.500]  He was the Director General of UNESCO.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.961]  And I remember reading, and he says it's real.
[00:49:06.001 --> 00:49:08.782]  Well, now I've read the stuff he was reading in the 30s!
[00:49:08.822 --> 00:49:10.962]  Man, these people are nuts, okay?
[00:49:11.262 --> 00:49:13.523]  We are in a science fiction horror movie!
[00:49:14.136 --> 00:49:15.096]  You understand this?
[00:49:16.437 --> 00:49:18.817]  People are busy arguing about Republican, Democrat.
[00:49:19.057 --> 00:49:21.478]  That is a total matrix of disinformation.
[00:49:21.678 --> 00:49:25.299]  And I've always said that because, you know, I mean, I meant it to a certain extent.
[00:49:25.339 --> 00:49:27.519]  Now I'm beginning to realize it's totally fake.
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.740]  I mean, it's totally fake, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:37.922]  And it's all about the illusion of a debate going on and the illusion that they're still in power.
[00:49:38.022 --> 00:49:38.842]  I mean, it's just
[00:49:42.685 --> 00:49:45.546]  I just can't believe how innocent and good things are in the world.
[00:49:45.826 --> 00:49:47.006]  How much goodness there is.
[00:49:47.046 --> 00:49:47.706]  How much beauty.
[00:49:48.106 --> 00:49:49.767]  And I see that and I'm like smiling.
[00:49:49.827 --> 00:49:50.267]  I love it.
[00:49:51.467 --> 00:49:55.448]  And then I look at the New World Order and it's like, what in the world is this?
[00:49:56.928 --> 00:50:00.469]  I mean, it is the things these people have done.
[00:50:00.489 --> 00:50:04.350]  I try to make this point.
[00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:06.190]  200 million plus people they killed.
[00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:08.711]  How many sports stadiums of 100,000 people is that?
[00:50:11.337 --> 00:50:20.099]  And you know, yuppies and trendies and nerds, and I'm a nerd myself, but you know what I mean, the nerd type, who just giggle and laugh at everything.
[00:50:20.679 --> 00:50:24.420]  They tune into this show, man, and I see their comments later, and they go, that guy's nuts, he's crazy.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.720]  Man, I wish I was nuts and crazy, okay?
[00:50:26.961 --> 00:50:28.201]  This stuff's real!
[00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:29.961]  Okay?
[00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:30.701]  It's real!
[00:50:31.321 --> 00:50:32.442]  This isn't a game!
[00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:36.163]  They're hurting so many innocent people!
[00:50:36.803 --> 00:50:37.983]  They're hurting so much beauty!
[00:50:38.641 --> 00:50:42.043]  They get away with so much, I just want to see them beaten.
[00:50:43.144 --> 00:50:45.145]  I want to see them with their guts stomped out, folks.
[00:50:45.385 --> 00:50:50.048]  I want to see these criminals and bullies and sickos where they deserve to be six feet under.
[00:50:51.168 --> 00:50:51.849]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:51.869 --> 00:50:53.230]  Stay with me.
[00:51:02.111 --> 00:51:05.297]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:05.617 --> 00:51:07.541]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:07.942 --> 00:51:15.555]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:16.269 --> 00:51:23.332]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:23.712 --> 00:51:35.137]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:35.457 --> 00:51:39.019]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:39.419 --> 00:51:41.360]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.522]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:59.294 --> 00:52:02.877]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:02.917 --> 00:52:03.417]  are located?
[00:52:03.617 --> 00:52:06.999]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:07.239 --> 00:52:11.943]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:52:58.627 --> 00:53:01.229]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[00:53:01.369 --> 00:53:07.513]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[00:53:07.673 --> 00:53:16.800]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.261]  It's called SlenderFX.
[00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:25.306]  SlenderFX opens the door for a healthy metabolism, permanent weight loss, reduction of low thyroid symptoms, and considerably increased

[00:54:03.326 --> 00:54:04.987]  We're all riders on the storm.
[00:54:05.107 --> 00:54:06.649]  You only live one time.
[00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:08.811]  Make account for yourself.
[00:54:21.478 --> 00:54:25.501]  You know, there's a killer on the road.
[00:54:25.561 --> 00:54:27.563]  His brain is squirming.
[00:54:49.997 --> 00:54:54.481]  Yep.
[00:54:57.443 --> 00:55:00.546]  Welcome back.
[00:55:02.367 --> 00:55:05.570]  Look, I want to take calls today, and we're going to do it for Dr. Stephen Jones.
[00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.472]  Coming up, we're going to get on right as the next hour starts.
[00:55:10.453 --> 00:55:12.195]  The good news is, the sailors were released.
[00:55:12.235 --> 00:55:13.716]  Dr. Nadine Desjardins released them.
[00:55:14.767 --> 00:55:16.768]  And again, I'm no fan of any government, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:16.788 --> 00:55:17.708]  It's always going to be corrupt.
[00:55:17.728 --> 00:55:21.429]  But Iran, compared to the New World Order, is Tinkerbell.
[00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:33.373]  And expanding on that, the British, three days ago, two and a half days ago, were in the London Guardian, and the Foreign Office said, OK, there were some navigational mistakes made.
[00:55:33.593 --> 00:55:34.494]  We've told Iran.
[00:55:34.634 --> 00:55:35.614]  Now, that was in the news.
[00:55:36.314 --> 00:55:39.215]  But they said, OK, we're being diplomatic behind the scenes.
[00:55:40.596 --> 00:55:41.556]  We made some mistakes.
[00:55:41.656 --> 00:55:42.756]  Iran said, oh, that's it.
[00:55:43.077 --> 00:55:43.537]  They're released.
[00:55:43.577 --> 00:55:44.037]  Thank you.
[00:55:45.894 --> 00:55:52.678]  And, again, the Foreign Office had to admit that quote mistakes were made, which Tony Blair then ignored, and the media then pretty much ignored.
[00:55:52.698 --> 00:55:53.558]  It was in the back of the paper.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:09.947]  Because the former head of their Maritime Administration, who before that ran that very sector, said, well, they were in the no man's land, and probably up in the, it was hard to tell, but in the Iranian waters, and they were searching boats, and we would have arrested them if they were that far over in our waters.
[00:56:10.887 --> 00:56:11.788]  In the Iraqi waters.
[00:56:12.791 --> 00:56:17.733]  I mean, as soon as... I mean, look, they've got people grabbing their diplomats, shooting their people.
[00:56:17.873 --> 00:56:18.073]  U.S.
[00:56:18.093 --> 00:56:19.773]  Special Forces are in Iran.
[00:56:20.053 --> 00:56:21.554]  That's admitted by our own news.
[00:56:21.574 --> 00:56:26.536]  Can you imagine if Iranian troops were running around bombing things here in the U.S.?
[00:56:27.376 --> 00:56:35.239]  And so, Iran then sees these patrol boats coming up into its waters.
[00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:41.161]  Again, the guy that ran this for Britain said British troops would have arrested them.
[00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:48.452]  So he's been in the position of running the Persian Gulf, and then at the national, international position of running it all.
[00:56:48.752 --> 00:56:52.994]  In the British government, he's been a Lord High Commissioner, all that, and you ought to go read the guy's bio.
[00:56:53.054 --> 00:56:54.455]  We've had him on before on other issues.
[00:56:55.515 --> 00:56:56.716]  That's just the facts.
[00:56:57.616 --> 00:57:02.479]  And so now Blair's spinning and going, because Doc Mendenshott said, well, the British apologized, so we let him go.
[00:57:03.139 --> 00:57:06.240]  And then after Britain gets him back, notice they didn't say that until they got him back.
[00:57:07.721 --> 00:57:10.102]  And then Britain, after they got him back, said, no, we never said that.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.102]  And I wonder out of those 15 if they'll get one of them to come out and say they were pressured.
[00:57:14.703 --> 00:57:16.664]  But see, the problem is it'll be like Private Lynch then.
[00:57:17.044 --> 00:57:18.525]  Others will say, no, we weren't pressured.
[00:57:22.067 --> 00:57:24.569]  No, those Marines were ordered to go into there.
[00:57:24.669 --> 00:57:26.550]  I guarantee you they were scared to death when they were doing it.
[00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:27.430]  They knew what they were doing.
[00:57:27.691 --> 00:57:31.113]  The British had just changed the maps and claimed they controlled Iranian waters.
[00:57:31.393 --> 00:57:33.054]  They knew they were going to get grabbed, probably.
[00:57:34.289 --> 00:57:43.252]  So of course, I mean, they weren't tortured, they weren't pressured, they weren't raped with battery acid like the Army report says people were at Abu Ghraib.
[00:57:43.872 --> 00:57:46.653]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's not Grindhouse.
[00:57:47.353 --> 00:57:53.195]  You know, it's not some Quentin Tarantino movie like Terror Planet.
[00:57:54.516 --> 00:57:55.996]  All at the Grindhouse.
[00:57:56.456 --> 00:57:58.457]  It was the real world.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:04.242]  At Abu Ghraib and twenty-something other camps, and Camp X-Ray, and secret camps around the world.
[00:58:04.302 --> 00:58:06.282]  It was pliers and toddlers.
[00:58:07.683 --> 00:58:09.583]  White House... White House report!
[00:58:09.983 --> 00:58:14.585]  And I hear all these ninnies on talk radio... They heard that they were tortured!
[00:58:14.825 --> 00:58:15.745]  They're iranians!
[00:58:15.785 --> 00:58:16.806]  They're so evil!
[00:58:17.106 --> 00:58:21.287]  And I heard those same whiners calling in when the torture news was big a year ago going, Good!
[00:58:21.367 --> 00:58:21.947]  Torture them!
[00:58:22.227 --> 00:58:23.788]  Jack Bauer gets tough on 24!
[00:58:24.228 --> 00:58:26.549]  You're a scum!
[00:58:28.339 --> 00:58:31.462]  Can you imagine the soft cowards if they got tortured?
[00:58:31.482 --> 00:58:33.364]  Can you imagine the scum?
[00:58:33.604 --> 00:58:34.625]  You're not our countrymen!
[00:58:34.865 --> 00:58:37.928]  Stop calling yourselves American!
[00:58:39.209 --> 00:58:43.453]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:43.473 --> 00:58:43.773]  Hello Fo-
[00:58:55.356 --> 00:58:56.016]  Big Brother.
[00:58:56.677 --> 00:58:57.717]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:58.437 --> 00:58:59.558]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.198 --> 00:59:01.018]  You want answers?
[00:59:01.778 --> 00:59:02.739]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:07.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.521 --> 00:59:11.602]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.806 --> 00:59:30.234]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, and we have Professor Stephen Jones joining us.
[00:59:30.254 --> 00:59:39.365]  I'm very honored to have this scholarly, gentlemanly, extremely intelligent, trailblazing, award-winning scientist.
[00:59:40.129 --> 00:59:43.691]  With us, I just want to recap that we have DefendRosie.com.
[00:59:44.251 --> 00:59:47.693]  The petition got up close to 2,000 after just a few hours.
[00:59:47.713 --> 00:59:52.276]  It went up last night with no promotion, then it went crazy, and then the little message board system crashed.
[00:59:52.536 --> 00:59:57.159]  But they're getting it back up, and so you can just keep spreading that URL everywhere.
[00:59:57.179 --> 01:00:07.465]  You can also send us an email to DefendRosie at InfoWars.com, and with your statement, and then your name, and then we will add you to the petition.
[01:00:09.145 --> 01:00:13.746]  And we will have all those posted to the site on a daily basis in a separate area.
[01:00:14.066 --> 01:00:17.386]  DefendRosie at Infowars.com.
[01:00:18.127 --> 01:00:21.167]  Again, for stations just joining us, why is this important?
[01:00:21.207 --> 01:00:30.289]  Because Fox News, CNN, ABC, they're all saying, all these different show hosts are saying, we need to destroy her so that no one else talks like this.
[01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:38.230]  They're openly saying, fire her to set the precedent when a lot of other big, high-powered people in government, out-of-government media
[01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:40.049]  Are about to go public.
[01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.271]  This is a new blacklist.
[01:00:43.171 --> 01:00:46.894]  Now, they railroaded Professor Jones, but he got out of it pretty good.
[01:00:46.914 --> 01:00:50.037]  Amazing trumped-up stuff.
[01:00:50.097 --> 01:00:50.978]  Incredible lies.
[01:00:51.018 --> 01:00:52.099]  They had to back off of that.
[01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:55.241]  They have gone after and fired so many people.
[01:00:55.361 --> 01:01:03.147]  Of course, Mr. Barnett, the fella at Underwriting Laboratories.
[01:01:04.295 --> 01:01:08.397]  So many people who went public and said this is impossible have been fired.
[01:01:08.737 --> 01:01:10.558]  A lot of people have paid a great price.
[01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:11.999]  We need to pray for them.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.561]  But I tell you, they're building up treasures in heaven.
[01:01:15.221 --> 01:01:18.763]  And they're making this world we live on today a lot better place.
[01:01:19.283 --> 01:01:20.284]  And they're trailblazers.
[01:01:20.564 --> 01:01:21.304]  They're heroes.
[01:01:22.125 --> 01:01:26.747]  And again, just an incredible bio, Professor Stephen Jones.
[01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:31.190]  And we're about to break here in just a moment, but Professor Jones, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:32.510]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:33.771]  I'm glad to be on again.
[01:01:34.727 --> 01:01:36.290]  Good to talk to you.
[01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:39.898]  That was at Underwriter Labs, that's my friend Kevin Ryan.
[01:01:40.038 --> 01:01:42.503]  Kevin Ryan, my memory is, I'm self-conscious today.
[01:01:42.603 --> 01:01:45.128]  There's lots of good people coming out, aren't there?
[01:01:46.553 --> 01:01:48.315]  To be hard to keep track of all of them.
[01:01:50.176 --> 01:01:54.080]  We interviewed him about a year ago and he was there and saw the report and told to shut up.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.421]  They did internal testing.
[01:01:55.441 --> 01:01:55.862]  Kevin Ryan.
[01:01:55.882 --> 01:01:58.084]  Lots of us coming out of the woodwork.
[01:01:58.204 --> 01:01:58.885]  I know it's Kevin Ryan.
[01:01:58.945 --> 01:02:01.987]  I've got his face there in front of me.
[01:02:07.372 --> 01:02:07.752]  Good for you.
[01:02:07.852 --> 01:02:09.373]  I've just got to thank Nolan, Ryan.
[01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:12.274]  I'm so flustered with this whole Rosie O'Donnell thing.
[01:02:12.294 --> 01:02:12.734]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:13.034 --> 01:02:13.795]  Isn't that something?
[01:02:13.935 --> 01:02:17.016]  First off, tell us, in the minute we've got before we've got a break, about yourself.
[01:02:17.036 --> 01:02:17.516]  Who you are.
[01:02:18.476 --> 01:02:20.377]  Well, I'm Stephen Jones.
[01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:35.163]  I'm a retired now professor of physics and work, of course, at Cornell University and in Canada, Japan, Russia.
[01:02:37.492 --> 01:02:43.855]  In Russia, it wasn't so much work at the lab as visits there at the lab to talk to them about the work.
[01:02:43.935 --> 01:02:47.817]  But England, did some work in England on fusion energy.
[01:02:49.217 --> 01:02:54.079]  I've run a few laps around the track, Alex.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:03:01.122]  Well, I mean, I didn't know until recently, and I knew a lot about you, Professor Jones, that you're seen as one of the top people in your field.
[01:03:01.983 --> 01:03:03.123]  In fusion, yeah.
[01:03:03.183 --> 01:03:06.985]  Metal-catalyzed fusion and muon-catalyzed fusion, that is correct.
[01:03:07.643 --> 01:03:08.163]  Actually, I haven't.
[01:03:08.303 --> 01:03:18.669]  And then, it's amazing, there are people who don't even have true scientific degrees, who have more philosophical stuff, that shoot their mouth off and call themselves the greatest scientists ever.
[01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:22.071]  Yeah, well, right.
[01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:35.158]  I don't know if we want to name those, but there are some with some very... You know, I don't mind speculative theories as long as they're backed up with civility, for one thing, and with evidence, solid evidence.
[01:03:35.858 --> 01:03:36.939]  Those two factors are...
[01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.437]  Of course, it's a standard for science.
[01:03:40.118 --> 01:03:41.100]  Well, it's just too bad.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:46.409]  We're going to go to break and come back with Professor Steven Jones, and we're going to lay out what really happened with those buildings.
[01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:49.034]  We're 9-11 Truth is Today, and take your call.
[01:03:49.074 --> 01:03:49.475]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.346 --> 01:03:59.790]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:07.756]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:08.504 --> 01:04:15.548]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:15.948 --> 01:04:27.374]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:27.694 --> 01:04:31.296]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:31.657 --> 01:04:33.578]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:33.918 --> 01:04:37.760]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:45.352]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:04:51.943 --> 01:05:01.009]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:12.497]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:12.838 --> 01:05:17.661]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:05:17.861 --> 01:05:18.081]  I think so.
[01:05:36.681 --> 01:05:40.003]  Let's get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:41.725]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.745 --> 01:05:42.085]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:43.846]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:53.995]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:05:54.495 --> 01:05:57.777]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:05:58.197 --> 01:06:01.139]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:06:01.419 --> 01:06:07.783]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:12.266]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:06:12.506 --> 01:06:16.867]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:06:17.027 --> 01:06:19.628]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:06:19.648 --> 01:06:22.409]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:06:22.889 --> 01:06:25.410]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:29.711]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:30.611]  Treasury bonds.
[01:06:30.891 --> 01:06:35.534]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:06:35.714 --> 01:06:40.497]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:40.757 --> 01:06:49.143]  That's 1-888-XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:06:51.224 --> 01:06:56.808]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:11.174]  Kevin Ryan of Underwriting Laboratories went public a few years ago about internal studies that Underwriting Laboratories had underwrote at the World Trade Center Complex and Building 7.
[01:07:12.614 --> 01:07:16.676]  Internal reports that showed that fire really couldn't have brought down those buildings the way they fell.
[01:07:17.817 --> 01:07:18.517]  He got fired.
[01:07:19.277 --> 01:07:26.480]  Professor Stephen Jones, award-winning, seen as one of the leaders in the field of different types of fusion.
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.922]  I mean, you talk about right up there at the marquee level.
[01:07:31.386 --> 01:07:34.248]  Just many published papers in the most prestigious journals.
[01:07:34.648 --> 01:07:49.137]  He's been public now for a few years on the fact that Building 7 and Tower 1 and 2 are clearly inside jobs and has pioneered amazing research and he's been attacked by a lot of the disinfo operatives and their fellow travelers and useful idiots and court jesters.
[01:07:50.057 --> 01:07:54.860]  But the point is, now Rosie O'Donnell is under massive, sustained attack.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:05.292]  And they're openly saying on Fox, MSNBC, CNN that she needs to be ruined publicly for questioning the government, that that's not America, that she hates the troops, she hates America.
[01:08:05.872 --> 01:08:06.313]  In truth,
[01:08:07.245 --> 01:08:15.233]  We know from behind-the-scenes sources that Rosie is completely freaked out, that Rosie is very upset, that she's done massive research.
[01:08:15.293 --> 01:08:32.789]  The postings, now there's like 10 of them she's done on her blog about 9-11, about Building 7, with links to sites that Professor Jones is involved with, and sites that we're involved with, and she's quoted Terror Storm on her blog, I mean, word for word.
[01:08:33.946 --> 01:08:34.726]  On false flag.
[01:08:34.746 --> 01:08:35.987]  We know she's done her research.
[01:08:36.507 --> 01:08:42.048]  I know some things that I'm not at liberty to talk about until she's ready to go public.
[01:08:43.169 --> 01:08:44.649]  But so much has happened.
[01:08:45.509 --> 01:08:47.350]  And they're trying to fire her.
[01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:49.230]  They're trying to get her removed.
[01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:55.792]  And then this will cause a chilling effect to shut down literally hundreds and hundreds of other prominent scientists.
[01:08:56.709 --> 01:09:09.258]  High level brass in the military, they had two weeks ago a huge secret Hollywood meeting with some top Hollywood people, country singers, TV people, I mean a lot of them at the very highest level about how they should go public.
[01:09:10.559 --> 01:09:17.163]  So the battle is joined and this is one of the top news, this is bigger than Anna Nicole Smith's diversion right now.
[01:09:18.047 --> 01:09:18.887]  This is real news.
[01:09:19.207 --> 01:09:22.949]  So we started DefendRosie.com with a petition there.
[01:09:23.629 --> 01:09:24.449]  It's gotten so many.
[01:09:24.489 --> 01:09:25.270]  It crashed today.
[01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.410]  We're re-uploading it.
[01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:32.432]  So you can also send your name to be added to the petition to DefendRosie at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:33.373 --> 01:09:34.533]  And we'll get it posted up there.
[01:09:35.394 --> 01:09:39.575]  But somebody who knows about persecution is Professor Steven Jones.
[01:09:39.615 --> 01:09:40.836]  And I know he's a winner.
[01:09:41.196 --> 01:09:45.917]  So he doesn't like to get into all the things he went with and how he was... And they didn't claim any
[01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:54.675]  Academic dishonesty or anything he'd done or any problems, they just said, hey, we'd like to pay you to leave.
[01:09:55.396 --> 01:09:56.277]  And he did that.
[01:09:56.457 --> 01:09:59.360]  And since I brought that up, you've been persecuted, but it hasn't worked.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.541]  And that's a lesson here.
[01:10:01.021 --> 01:10:02.142]  You're a hero to this country.
[01:10:02.242 --> 01:10:11.470]  Can you just briefly tell us about Professor Stephen E. Jones, your history, recapping for stations that just joined us, and then what happened to you, and then now you've been contacted by Rosie's people.
[01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:20.075]  And of course, you're such a gentleman, they wanted you on the show, and so you gave them the names of other physicists that have now gone public.
[01:10:20.275 --> 01:10:22.756]  Hopefully, they'll have you and some of the other physicists on.
[01:10:23.716 --> 01:10:34.060]  But Professor, just first off, tell us about yourself and what you've been through, your trials, your tribulations, kind of the Job Chronicle that you went through.
[01:10:35.061 --> 01:10:36.542]  Well, I appreciate that, Alex.
[01:10:38.203 --> 01:10:39.903]  It's been an interesting life, you know.
[01:10:39.923 --> 01:10:40.644]  I just turned 58.
[01:10:40.804 --> 01:11:02.108]  I look back over the years and my career really got started with muon catalyzed fusion as regards research and right off the bat we had a result, an experimental result, that defied the theory of muon catalyzed fusion.
[01:11:02.168 --> 01:11:05.869]  So then our experimental results were suspect and I remember being
[01:11:06.508 --> 01:11:12.270]  Roundly criticized by a professor at UC Berkeley, actually.
[01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:13.991]  I won't name him.
[01:11:14.091 --> 01:11:17.592]  But anyway, it turns out we were right.
[01:11:17.792 --> 01:11:23.654]  But it took other other work and experimenters coming forward and saying, look, these
[01:11:24.355 --> 01:11:25.156]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:43.935 --> 01:11:47.398]  Small energy increases, but the point is you proved it's real.
[01:11:47.658 --> 01:11:49.620]  It's now confirmed that it's real.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.701]  The problem is just capturing it.
[01:11:52.302 --> 01:11:53.142]  And small, right.
[01:11:53.182 --> 01:12:00.468]  Now that gets us over into metal-catalyzed fusion, which both of these areas are called cold fusion.
[01:12:00.508 --> 01:12:02.430]  That's why there's a confusion there.
[01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:03.390]  Confusion.
[01:12:03.931 --> 01:12:08.154]  But yeah, in the metal-catalyzed fusion, again, we had controversial results.
[01:12:09.073 --> 01:12:13.755]  As far as the scientific community, but our results have been verified.
[01:12:14.575 --> 01:12:18.036]  And the problem, as you mentioned, is that it's just small.
[01:12:18.236 --> 01:12:20.897]  The effect is a small one, but it's very real.
[01:12:21.617 --> 01:12:26.819]  And we are working on some experiments to beef up, to increase the yield.
[01:12:26.859 --> 01:12:35.642]  I'm very interested in, of course, energy in general, getting us off the oil as much as we possibly can for various reasons.
[01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:39.287]  But fusion is very promising in that regard.
[01:12:39.307 --> 01:12:43.511]  It's just also very difficult to control fusion in terms of energy.
[01:12:43.731 --> 01:12:45.993]  You've also pioneered some other areas of science.
[01:12:46.874 --> 01:12:58.043]  Well, the metal-catalyzed fusion and the muon-catalyzed fusion, I was principal investigator for the Department of Energy, actually, because I wrote the proposal and people joined me.
[01:12:58.283 --> 01:13:00.145]  By the way, there's a little, well, there's some stories.
[01:13:00.165 --> 01:13:01.066]  There's always stories.
[01:13:01.606 --> 01:13:03.668]  There was a group that tried to
[01:13:04.868 --> 01:13:09.452]  Take away from from me that is they wanted to be the leader.
[01:13:09.512 --> 01:13:32.991]  This was actually a Fellow at Los Alamos National Lab has now become a friend, but at the time He was trying to take the he said you know we would like to leave this project and I talked to I was at the Idaho National Engineering Lab at the time and they said no you you wrote the proposal you don't have to let them and
[01:13:33.819 --> 01:13:34.739]  Take the lead on it.
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:39.801]  You have that right as having originated the research.
[01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:42.082]  So it worked out in the end.
[01:13:42.182 --> 01:13:44.963]  I did get to retain the leadership.
[01:13:46.864 --> 01:13:52.586]  I would say that despite your pioneering energy developments, I think you're pioneering on exposing 9-11.
[01:13:53.146 --> 01:13:56.647]  That's been quite an experience there.
[01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:59.789]  It's just amazing the amount of flack I've had.
[01:13:59.829 --> 01:14:01.029]  I mean I had some flack on
[01:14:01.897 --> 01:14:02.297]  We're good.
[01:14:21.556 --> 01:14:24.697]  Gosh, that's offensive to me when people say you must be a U.S.
[01:14:24.717 --> 01:14:26.817]  hater to talk about these things.
[01:14:27.057 --> 01:14:33.358]  Well, in fact, it's the very people destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution that is the heart and soul of this republic.
[01:14:33.739 --> 01:14:35.539]  They're the ones that carried out 9-11!
[01:14:36.019 --> 01:14:37.039]  Well, that's the problem.
[01:14:37.579 --> 01:14:40.680]  That's surely the indication I get from these data.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:45.701]  And, you know, my area, Alex, is looking primarily at the hard physical evidence.
[01:14:46.401 --> 01:14:49.262]  And I would like to talk about some of that, which I will be talking now.
[01:14:50.789 --> 01:14:53.070]  That's right.
[01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:58.433]  I can't wait for you to get to meet my wife, hopefully, sometime on Saturday and Sunday while you're here.
[01:14:59.274 --> 01:15:00.455]  I can take you out to dinner.
[01:15:00.475 --> 01:15:04.437]  There's going to be a big event that we haven't even talked about yet, folks, next weekend.
[01:15:04.477 --> 01:15:06.018]  Not this weekend, but next weekend in Austin.
[01:15:06.038 --> 01:15:12.081]  But before we run out of time, because I'm sitting you down rabbit trails, Professor, let's go back now.
[01:15:13.422 --> 01:15:14.363]  You gave me some interesting news.
[01:15:14.403 --> 01:15:17.506]  I know a few weeks ago we had tried to give your info to Rosie's people.
[01:15:17.626 --> 01:15:20.548]  I'm not saying that's what triggered this, but you did get contacted.
[01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:22.270]  Tell us about this exciting development.
[01:15:22.931 --> 01:15:23.491]  Well, sure.
[01:15:23.691 --> 01:15:35.622]  So a person from Rosie's team contacted me by email and of course I had heard just that very morning that Rosie had gone public.
[01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:39.706]  It was on a blog or something, but anyway, she'd talked about her
[01:15:40.467 --> 01:16:07.641]  Concerns about 9-11 and the voice this interest in having a physicist on her show Well, there are a few of us now physicists that have come out and studied and written and talked about 9-11 as an inside job based on evidence and So I wrote back to them and said I would be glad to appear and I named two other physicists who I trust now Who could also appear?
[01:16:08.869 --> 01:16:12.131]  And tell folks the names of those individuals.
[01:16:12.592 --> 01:16:13.012]  You bet.
[01:16:13.132 --> 01:16:22.838]  The other physicists, and both of these have written in the journal of 911studies.com, so I'll put a plug in for that journal, because it represents solid research.
[01:16:23.739 --> 01:16:26.381]  And these are Professor David Griscom,
[01:16:27.495 --> 01:16:28.756]  G-R-I-S-C-O-M.
[01:16:28.796 --> 01:16:31.597]  He's a fellow of the American Physical Society.
[01:16:31.657 --> 01:16:32.857]  I was so pleased to see him.
[01:16:32.877 --> 01:16:35.759]  We're not going to find any Marvin Martian proponents over there.
[01:16:35.999 --> 01:16:36.379]  No, no.
[01:16:36.699 --> 01:16:37.019]  You won't.
[01:16:37.079 --> 01:16:40.140]  Oh dear!
[01:16:42.982 --> 01:16:46.743]  The other one is Greg Jenkins, PhD.
[01:16:46.863 --> 01:16:47.744]  A young PhD.
[01:16:48.044 --> 01:16:49.304]  Lives out in the Washington D.C.
[01:16:49.384 --> 01:16:49.625]  area.
[01:16:49.685 --> 01:16:50.505]  Part of the D.C.
[01:16:50.525 --> 01:16:52.486]  9-11 Truth Group out there.
[01:16:52.546 --> 01:16:55.067]  Very good scientist as well.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:04.123]  So they contacted you and she's back from vacation in a week and a half and they're saying that they want to get you on the show?
[01:17:04.983 --> 01:17:05.943]  That's what they said.
[01:17:06.003 --> 01:17:09.505]  Now of course they said something like we need to get permission from the
[01:17:11.303 --> 01:17:13.624]  I don't know, broadcast or ABC or something like that.
[01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.484]  So it's not, it's still tentative.
[01:17:16.005 --> 01:17:21.746]  Well, exactly, and that's where I can bring in some new information, but I almost talked about this yesterday, but I've got to be careful.
[01:17:21.766 --> 01:17:22.767]  I can't let out too much.
[01:17:22.807 --> 01:17:23.407]  Yeah, sure.
[01:17:23.467 --> 01:17:26.208]  But I'm going to think about it and try to form my words.
[01:17:26.228 --> 01:17:35.371]  When we get back from break, I'm going to add a little bit more to this, just a little bit more, and I'm just going to leave it at that because I don't want to endanger some of the other big things that could be happening.
[01:17:37.168 --> 01:17:40.989]  If somebody would have told me 10, 15 years ago, I'd be doing this now, I'd tell them they were nuts.
[01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:43.030]  Do you ever feel the same way?
[01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:43.230]  Me too.
[01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:44.450]  I mean, I'm just amazed too.
[01:17:44.490 --> 01:17:46.191]  But to me, it's the data.
[01:17:46.351 --> 01:17:50.392]  Oh man, we got some data this week, Alex, that just blew me away.
[01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:53.433]  And the student I was working with was sitting there, wow!
[01:17:54.173 --> 01:17:55.113]  I'll talk to you about that.
[01:17:55.173 --> 01:17:57.074]  I don't mind talking to him about that.
[01:17:57.794 --> 01:18:04.516]  Well, I guarantee you that they don't want to have an award-winning physicist like yourself or other physicists up there.
[01:18:04.816 --> 01:18:06.597]  Tell us a little bit about these other two physicists.
[01:18:07.499 --> 01:18:18.867]  Well, let's see, Greg Jenkins is a young PhD, University of Maryland, as I recall, at College Park out there.
[01:18:21.368 --> 01:18:35.918]  He's written a paper, actually he took on this, what do you call it, Star Wars beam idea, and he went through and did calculations and showed that that idea just won't work in terms of energy balance.
[01:18:36.257 --> 01:18:41.507]  In other words, it takes too much energy and power to run.
[01:18:41.587 --> 01:18:44.733]  Also, you would visually see the event.
[01:18:45.394 --> 01:18:45.795]  Stay there.
[01:18:45.835 --> 01:18:46.436]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:51.443 --> 01:18:56.688]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:18:56.828 --> 01:19:04.916]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:19:05.176 --> 01:19:12.243]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:19:12.403 --> 01:19:13.684]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:19:13.764 --> 01:19:19.669]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:19:19.849 --> 01:19:24.933]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:19:25.053 --> 01:19:33.941]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:19:34.201 --> 01:19:37.483]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:19:39.585 --> 01:19:39.926]  We're good.
[01:19:51.467 --> 01:19:53.368]  Hi, Ted Anderson for Midas Resources.
[01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:54.128]  It's April 3rd, 2007.
[01:19:54.168 --> 01:19:54.709]  Gold is at $662.80.
[01:19:54.749 --> 01:19:57.790]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $686.25, $345.68 for half ounce, and $172.84 for quarter ounce coins.
[01:19:57.810 --> 01:19:58.070]  That's $686.25, $345.68, and $172.84.
[01:20:10.496 --> 01:20:14.078]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:20:14.138 --> 01:20:17.139]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:20:17.239 --> 01:20:26.323]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:20:26.643 --> 01:20:31.945]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:20:32.405 --> 01:20:34.687]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:37.189]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:20:37.589 --> 01:20:40.831]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.911 --> 01:20:44.614]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:44.914]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.934 --> 01:20:45.135]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.175 --> 01:20:49.698]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror.
[01:21:01.528 --> 01:21:04.691]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[01:21:04.911 --> 01:21:08.615]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:16.823]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[01:21:50.911 --> 01:21:59.424]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:21:59.664 --> 01:22:01.487]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:02.889]  That's one in four adults.
[01:22:03.209 --> 01:22:06.194]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it.
[01:22:06.494 --> 01:22:09.275]  The American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[01:22:37.691 --> 01:22:43.375]  Visit us online at researchedherbs.com or call us at 1-800-845-3841 to start protecting yourself from the silent killer.
[01:22:43.395 --> 01:22:43.595]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:22:54.108 --> 01:22:56.629]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:22:57.129 --> 01:22:59.849]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:07.371]  You know, I hate to give attention to this, but it has to be addressed occasionally.
[01:23:07.431 --> 01:23:12.993]  We're only going to spend a minute or two more on it, then we're going to get into the new hard data that's coming out.
[01:23:18.739 --> 01:23:20.220]  This is a novice, kind of a hobby.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:24.061]  Since I was a kid, I looked into the Star Wars program, STI lasers.
[01:23:24.401 --> 01:23:25.762]  My dad worked on it in college.
[01:23:25.822 --> 01:23:29.303]  I've interviewed Bowman, who headed up the program, and many others.
[01:23:29.363 --> 01:23:36.546]  A laser that could even, say, shoot through ten feet of steel, that would be so bright it would blind you.
[01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:39.347]  It would be like the sun, suddenly, a huge bright flash.
[01:23:41.428 --> 01:23:43.309]  Something that would destroy those steel buildings
[01:23:43.982 --> 01:23:49.751]  Well, the calculations have been done, and you're talking about the solar-type eruption power.
[01:23:50.933 --> 01:23:53.617]  And, again, no planes at the towers.
[01:23:53.718 --> 01:23:57.584]  I have friends and family that saw the first plane.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:03.945]  This is the type of disinfo that the government and their minions are putting out to discredit real hard research.
[01:24:03.965 --> 01:24:05.206]  And we expect them to do this.
[01:24:05.247 --> 01:24:12.473]  You know, it's come out now in the Kennedy assassination that they had all those CIA and FBI people inside Garrison's deal feeding him with disinfo.
[01:24:12.793 --> 01:24:13.754]  This is gonna happen.
[01:24:15.096 --> 01:24:17.718]  Professor Jones is the real McCoy and that's why he's being attacked.
[01:24:17.998 --> 01:24:22.863]  Finish up with the Marvin the Martian space beam and then let's get into the new real data.
[01:24:23.423 --> 01:24:24.844]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[01:24:25.205 --> 01:24:48.805]  Yeah, so if you look at the Journal of 9-11 Studies, I always encourage people as they get into these questions to go to the journal because there we have peer-reviewed papers and Greg Jenkins in the February issue has a paper entitled, The Overwhelming Implausibility of Using Directed Energy Beams to Demolish the World Trade Center.
[01:24:49.345 --> 01:24:50.106]  And he goes through the
[01:24:50.945 --> 01:24:59.628]  Fundamental reasons using physics arguments to demolish this theory that, you know, Star Wars beams would be used.
[01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:01.489]  And he did a good job.
[01:25:01.829 --> 01:25:09.452]  It's thorough and it could be answered if they if anybody wanted to, but boy, they'd have to come up with some very good explanations.
[01:25:09.832 --> 01:25:20.216]  For instance, he points out that the power required to knock down a tower would be at least five times the total power output of the entire Earth.
[01:25:21.545 --> 01:25:22.586]  And you just can't.
[01:25:22.906 --> 01:25:24.047]  There's just absolutely no way.
[01:25:24.387 --> 01:25:31.892]  You know, with a power requirement like that, you can't drive any type of weapon.
[01:25:32.032 --> 01:25:42.339]  Plus, from space, you've got the atmosphere to go through, you've got diffraction problems, clouds, all sorts of things that would tend to interrupt the beam.
[01:25:42.379 --> 01:25:44.681]  Plus, it would be at the tippy-top that it would start.
[01:25:44.741 --> 01:25:47.042]  Now, I think we've all seen the towers.
[01:25:47.102 --> 01:25:47.903]  They do not start
[01:25:48.982 --> 01:25:50.645]  Disintegrating at the tippy-top.
[01:25:50.765 --> 01:25:52.228]  It's down several floors.
[01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:57.118]  You know, 15 floors for the North Tower and about 30 floors down for the South Tower.
[01:25:58.465 --> 01:26:05.828]  Well, there wouldn't be a disintegration, the whole thing, if there was enough power, if they had a Death Star out there with Darth Vader piloting it.
[01:26:05.928 --> 01:26:09.130]  I mean, it would simply melt and then ooze down.
[01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:11.030]  That's another point, yeah.
[01:26:11.991 --> 01:26:12.831]  Yeah, there's so many.
[01:26:13.151 --> 01:26:24.136]  As you look at the physics of it, again, and of course that's what we did with the official conspiracy theory too, Alex, is we looked at their arguments and, you know, we can quite easily say,
[01:26:25.737 --> 01:26:39.120]  The buildings will not collapse like that, because you have to conserve energy, you have to conserve momentum, and frankly, you've got a lot of, well, hundreds of thousands of tons of steel and concrete in the way.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:44.321]  You can't get them to just fall at free fall speed without getting that material out of the way.
[01:26:44.841 --> 01:26:47.422]  So, you know, these are fundamental physics arguments.
[01:26:47.842 --> 01:26:53.503]  And we apply the laws of physics to various hypotheses, and if something comes along,
[01:26:54.421 --> 01:27:00.627]  You know, Star Wars hypothesis will apply the laws of physics as Greg Jenkins did in detail in his paper.
[01:27:01.488 --> 01:27:02.569]  Photographs and so on.
[01:27:02.589 --> 01:27:04.931]  He did a quite a very thorough job, I'd say.
[01:27:05.792 --> 01:27:08.474]  And we do the same thing with the official conspiracy theory.
[01:27:08.494 --> 01:27:13.518]  We demolish these theories because they don't stand up to the laws of physics.
[01:27:13.539 --> 01:27:15.240]  It's really quite straightforward.
[01:27:16.201 --> 01:27:19.364]  Dr. Griscom did a paper like that too.
[01:27:19.804 --> 01:27:20.245]  He wrote
[01:27:21.535 --> 01:27:41.772]  Manuel Garcia in Counterpunch, you may have heard about that, wrote a pro-official story paper in Counterpunch and David Griscom just got tired of it and he said, look this paper's full of holes and so he went through and that of course was in response to another physicist.
[01:27:41.812 --> 01:27:43.053]  So this is good.
[01:27:43.073 --> 01:27:45.895]  David Griscom then has joined our side, our way of
[01:27:47.499 --> 01:27:56.885]  Approaching and looking, applying science to the study of the destruction of the World Trade Center.
[01:27:56.905 --> 01:28:02.369]  9-11 is, and we'll get back and talk about some of the new data that you've discovered, but 9-11 is just getting bigger and bigger.
[01:28:02.389 --> 01:28:02.689]  It is.
[01:28:02.929 --> 01:28:11.095]  It is becoming a central issue because we've continued to push it and because the enemies continue to use it as the pretext for wars and domestic police states.
[01:28:11.375 --> 01:28:12.475]  Where do you see it going?
[01:28:13.336 --> 01:28:14.397]  Well, you know, I see this
[01:28:15.276 --> 01:28:19.217]  Taking off as more and more people join us, Alex, yourself.
[01:28:19.797 --> 01:28:25.358]  And people out there handing out DVDs and literature, they're doing a lot, too.
[01:28:25.378 --> 01:28:29.298]  This is spreading, like I say, I think it's spreading like wildfire at the grassroots level.
[01:28:29.478 --> 01:28:29.999]  I agree.
[01:28:30.199 --> 01:28:32.319]  Professor Stephen Jones, Dr. Jones, stay with us.
[01:28:32.339 --> 01:28:37.340]  We're going to come back, get into some of the new data you've gotten on the controlled demolition, and then we'll take calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:38.420]  We're on the march.
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.540]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.328 --> 01:28:48.110]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:51.814 --> 01:28:52.814]  How are you doing today?
[01:28:53.035 --> 01:28:53.515]  Why ask?
[01:28:53.555 --> 01:28:59.740]  Because if you have health challenges, then reading our free e-booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.464]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.
[01:29:04.764 --> 01:29:10.429]  It's a centuries-old medicinal fruit whose time has come, and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:15.812]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potential of this amazing fruit.
[01:29:16.053 --> 01:29:22.557]  The powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over with health concerns just like yours.
[01:29:22.897 --> 01:29:26.059]  You can have this 22-page e-booklet absolutely free.
[01:29:26.239 --> 01:29:30.422]  We'll also offer you a website with links to actual testimonials and product information.
[01:29:30.642 --> 01:29:32.824]  Could this fruit help you in your quest for total health?
[01:29:33.104 --> 01:29:40.569]  Find out why Mangosteen is known as the Queen of All Fruits and why it's fast becoming the best-selling wellness product ever brought to the market.
[01:29:40.689 --> 01:29:41.509]  We're good to go.
[01:30:06.792 --> 01:30:07.192]  We're good.
[01:30:25.029 --> 01:30:25.469]  I think so.
[01:30:52.375 --> 01:30:56.417]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:56.637 --> 01:31:00.039]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:00.219 --> 01:31:03.721]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:03.961 --> 01:31:07.222]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:07.242 --> 01:31:12.705]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:12.725 --> 01:31:17.888]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:31:18.268 --> 01:31:18.969]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:31:35.822 --> 01:31:37.223]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822.
[01:31:37.383 --> 01:31:40.204]  Or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:40.304 --> 01:31:41.864]  That toll free number again?
[01:31:41.884 --> 01:31:43.085]  1-877-928-88... We don't need no education.
[01:31:43.445 --> 01:31:46.326]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:32:15.741 --> 01:32:17.843]  All right, we did get the petition back up and working.
[01:32:17.863 --> 01:32:20.505]  There's thousands and thousands and thousands of people that have signed.
[01:32:20.525 --> 01:32:25.769]  This went up late last night, and we started the website DefendRosie.com.
[01:32:25.829 --> 01:32:27.150]  It's going absolutely gangbusters.
[01:32:27.190 --> 01:32:27.911]  Keep pushing it.
[01:32:28.592 --> 01:32:29.452]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:32:29.492 --> 01:32:30.913]  Get that URL out to everybody.
[01:32:30.933 --> 01:32:33.135]  Get the article Paul Watson wrote out to everybody.
[01:32:33.395 --> 01:32:34.436]  This is a call to action.
[01:32:34.456 --> 01:32:35.757]  You're doing a fabulous job.
[01:32:36.138 --> 01:32:37.479]  Let's redouble our efforts.
[01:32:39.236 --> 01:32:47.020]  At the same time, O'Reilly has been plugging this ABC News poll we learned against Rosie, and he was winning it.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.882]  But now people learned of it, and it's neck and neck.
[01:32:49.902 --> 01:32:54.504]  It's like 7,000-something votes for Rosie, 7,000-something for O'Reilly.
[01:32:55.109 --> 01:33:02.512]  And the neocon websites are all linked to it saying, vote her down, that she's bad and that Bill O'Reilly's good.
[01:33:03.092 --> 01:33:04.092]  We need to defeat it.
[01:33:04.152 --> 01:33:04.572]  Bill has 7,266.
[01:33:04.632 --> 01:33:04.932]  She has 7,095.
[01:33:05.153 --> 01:33:06.593]  2,125 said they find her annoying.
[01:33:06.613 --> 01:33:07.693]  Get up there and vote now.
[01:33:07.733 --> 01:33:08.854]  How do you find the link?
[01:33:08.874 --> 01:33:10.775]  Prisonplanet.com.
[01:33:21.187 --> 01:33:23.148]  We never talked about Anna Nicole Smith.
[01:33:23.168 --> 01:33:24.128]  We never talked about O.J.
[01:33:24.168 --> 01:33:24.548]  Simpson.
[01:33:24.568 --> 01:33:26.009]  We never talked about Michael Jackson.
[01:33:26.429 --> 01:33:28.670]  We don't talk about Hollywood stars and these people.
[01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:31.951]  We're talking about this because she's got courage.
[01:33:32.051 --> 01:33:32.952]  She's gone public.
[01:33:33.492 --> 01:33:37.493]  We know behind the scenes, and I'll go ahead and talk about this and go back to Professor Steven Jones and your calls.
[01:33:39.634 --> 01:33:42.055]  We know behind the scenes she's very upset.
[01:33:42.315 --> 01:33:48.398]  She's done her research and she has, I'm just going to say this, been meeting with 9-11 victims.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:53.485]  And she's been reaching out to experts, and she's known about this for a while.
[01:33:54.787 --> 01:33:59.234]  And she's been doing her homework just like Charlie Sheen did, and she just can't keep her mouth shut.
[01:33:59.754 --> 01:34:05.543]  If you've got any soul, and please don't judge her for some of the things in her personal life, none of us are perfect.
[01:34:07.076 --> 01:34:10.058]  She's silly and she's been ignorant in the past, but she's got guts and guts is enough.
[01:34:10.638 --> 01:34:14.001]  I mean, how many of you have done things that aren't too good?
[01:34:14.561 --> 01:34:16.723]  How many of you have been wrong about politics and issues?
[01:34:17.383 --> 01:34:19.445]  She knows about the New World Order now.
[01:34:19.805 --> 01:34:21.086]  She knows about globalism.
[01:34:21.146 --> 01:34:22.687]  She's gotten the big picture, okay?
[01:34:24.028 --> 01:34:27.630]  I actually have talked to three different people that know her, that have met with her.
[01:34:28.591 --> 01:34:29.692]  She's been given my material.
[01:34:29.732 --> 01:34:30.692]  She knew about my material.
[01:34:31.213 --> 01:34:33.174]  Last week she quoted Terror Storm, folks.
[01:34:34.055 --> 01:34:35.696]  You know, the part where I talk about false flags?
[01:34:36.807 --> 01:34:41.570]  She quotes the script, the voiceover of Terror Storm for a full paragraph.
[01:34:41.670 --> 01:34:43.852]  I'm not going to say too much about it.
[01:34:43.932 --> 01:34:49.935]  It's just that I know some other really riveting and important stuff, but this is such an important fight.
[01:34:49.955 --> 01:34:51.496]  They're trying to set this chilling effect.
[01:34:51.737 --> 01:35:03.304]  Professor Jones, can you speak in defense of Rosie or add your point as you've gone through being blackballed, being attacked, being demonized, how important it is to stand up for whistleblowers or for people that have the type of courage that Rosie's had?
[01:35:04.148 --> 01:35:20.840]  It's very important Alex and you know I've been on I voted on those polls myself and I get to support Rosie of course and I'd be glad to be on her show if I whatever I can do to help bring out these truths.
[01:35:21.221 --> 01:35:31.268]  I had a professor yesterday actually here tell me that my being well put on leave was it had a chilling effect that was his word to a chilling effect on
[01:35:31.769 --> 01:35:35.491]  Some of the people around here who've been interested in this same subject.
[01:35:36.371 --> 01:35:37.892]  So yeah, there's that.
[01:35:38.512 --> 01:35:46.536]  It does seem to be definitely a concerted effort when somebody stands out and speaks out, they're knocking them down.
[01:35:46.556 --> 01:35:50.878]  At least they haven't locked you up like they did Galileo for seven years.
[01:35:57.163 --> 01:35:58.324]  No, you're right there.
[01:35:58.484 --> 01:36:02.746]  I'm really glad that I'm able to keep researching and publishing.
[01:36:04.787 --> 01:36:14.152]  It's what I like to do, of course, is to study things to get to the bottom of matters using hard physical evidence wherever possible.
[01:36:14.955 --> 01:36:44.704]  Well, you know, now they're talking about outlawing, saying global warming isn't real, because the majority of the real climatologists and ice core specialists and folks that study the Arctic are saying that this isn't true, that carbon dioxide, this conclusive, comes after the warming, and that plants breathe more of it, and it creates more oxygen, more plankton, more fish, and that actually we are in an oxygen-poor environment compared to what we've been previously, and that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.
[01:36:45.498 --> 01:36:49.181]  Yeah, that's another issue.
[01:36:49.261 --> 01:36:55.045]  It's time for scientists to realize that when they speak out, it's going to make a difference.
[01:36:55.085 --> 01:37:00.148]  But we've got to stand up and speak out, even if we get some opposition.
[01:37:00.188 --> 01:37:01.670]  You have to expect that.
[01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:05.252]  My greatest hero, Alex, is Jesus.
[01:37:05.572 --> 01:37:07.374]  He had a lot of opposition.
[01:37:11.161 --> 01:37:12.841]  This quick story comes to mind if I could.
[01:37:13.142 --> 01:37:17.743]  A friend of mine was talking about Jesus saying, why won't you scribe Pharisees hypocrites?
[01:37:18.263 --> 01:37:21.144]  And someone in class raised their hand and said, wait a minute, that's not Christian!
[01:37:21.164 --> 01:37:25.585]  That's not Christian to attack, you know, these are the nation's leaders.
[01:37:26.345 --> 01:37:27.705]  How could anybody do that?
[01:37:28.145 --> 01:37:31.946]  And the teacher paused me and said, well, this is Jesus Christ himself.
[01:37:31.986 --> 01:37:34.467]  He defines what is Christian.
[01:37:34.527 --> 01:37:37.908]  You know, so I feel... Amazing.
[01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:47.317]  Yeah, so you know, we do need to speak out, and it's time for scientists to, and we're realizing that, you know, there's been some stifling.
[01:37:49.078 --> 01:37:55.303]  And I'm so glad to see people speaking out, like Rosie, and like Professor Griscom and Jenkins and others now.
[01:37:55.991 --> 01:37:58.212]  Kevin Ryan and so on, speaking out on 9-11.
[01:37:58.252 --> 01:38:00.053]  You know, there's hundreds now.
[01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:02.875]  Well, look at how they put Charlie Sheen through the ringer.
[01:38:03.155 --> 01:38:07.818]  They've called for Mark Cuban, funding Loose Change Final Cut to be sent to prison.
[01:38:08.658 --> 01:38:12.720]  In fact, on MSNBC, on Scarborough Country, they said they wanted Rosie to be murdered.
[01:38:13.341 --> 01:38:14.842]  Yeah, wasn't that something, that guy?
[01:38:15.782 --> 01:38:18.824]  I don't know why they didn't get him
[01:38:20.054 --> 01:38:23.596]  Prosecutor, you know, he has to have some accountability.
[01:38:23.816 --> 01:38:29.018]  I bet money if you or I went on national TV and said somebody needs to be killed, we'd get a visit from the cops.
[01:38:29.779 --> 01:38:34.181]  Oh yeah, we'd be right away putting the lock up, absolutely.
[01:38:34.561 --> 01:38:36.762]  Now you've got some new developments.
[01:38:37.262 --> 01:38:38.023]  I do, yeah.
[01:38:38.543 --> 01:38:40.664]  I would like to talk about these a bit.
[01:38:40.984 --> 01:38:46.867]  I alluded back in February to some of these things at the Arizona conference, but these are the metal
[01:38:49.437 --> 01:38:51.058]  Getting my tongue twisted here a little bit.
[01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:55.301]  Metal spheres that are found in the World Trade Center dust.
[01:38:55.742 --> 01:38:56.962]  Now others have noticed this.
[01:38:57.163 --> 01:39:01.025]  In particular, USGS talks about these metal spheres.
[01:39:01.065 --> 01:39:05.869]  But I found one back in January that was a millimeter.
[01:39:05.909 --> 01:39:08.751]  It's about a sixteenth of an inch with my naked eye.
[01:39:09.111 --> 01:39:10.272]  Now we have gone in
[01:39:12.409 --> 01:39:21.398]  That's some cooperation of a lab with an electron microscope to look at these spheres and to look at the elements inside of these spheres.
[01:39:22.179 --> 01:39:24.861]  This is just amazing.
[01:39:25.101 --> 01:39:29.145]  First of all, to form a droplet, Alex, it requires a liquid.
[01:39:30.126 --> 01:39:34.871]  I mean, many of these are nearly perfect spheres as I'm looking at them here on my screen.
[01:39:35.918 --> 01:39:37.799]  from the electron microscope.
[01:39:38.399 --> 01:39:48.843]  So you form a liquid and then surface tension pulls it into a sphere and then as this material travels through the air, metal, it hardens and retains that spherical shape.
[01:39:49.303 --> 01:39:53.285]  But the shape alone is telling us with the metal content.
[01:39:53.305 --> 01:39:55.725]  So you're finding previously molten spheres?
[01:39:56.466 --> 01:39:57.606]  That's exactly right.
[01:39:58.486 --> 01:39:59.247]  You got the point.
[01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:05.289]  Previously molten metal and we're looking inside comparing the contents with
[01:40:05.908 --> 01:40:12.752]  World Trade Center steel with aluminum alloy and with thermate residues.
[01:40:12.972 --> 01:40:16.054]  Thermate also produces these spheres.
[01:40:16.515 --> 01:40:19.256]  I have electron micro photographs of those as well.
[01:40:20.177 --> 01:40:23.359]  So that, in other words, photos with an electron microscope.
[01:40:24.379 --> 01:40:28.002]  So you have these spheres formed, you know, of course we've talked about thermate.
[01:40:28.882 --> 01:40:33.225]  And a lot of people have looked at that interview you and I had, by the way, Alex, on thermate.
[01:40:33.865 --> 01:40:34.846]  Well, this adds to it.
[01:40:35.385 --> 01:40:39.128]  So, in the dust itself, we have this information.
[01:40:40.029 --> 01:40:47.375]  And, you know, I just have to thank Jeanette McKinley for saving that dust and letting me have a sample of it.
[01:40:48.135 --> 01:40:55.461]  Because the origin of these spheres, I mean, it's like locked up information.
[01:40:55.481 --> 01:40:56.582]  How did these form?
[01:40:56.722 --> 01:40:57.603]  Where did you come from?
[01:40:57.943 --> 01:41:01.065]  Well, you interrogate them using what's called EDX.
[01:41:02.438 --> 01:41:05.024]  You look at an individual sphere, you say, what are you made of?
[01:41:05.906 --> 01:41:06.948]  What's your composition?
[01:41:07.008 --> 01:41:07.950]  Where did you come from?
[01:41:08.912 --> 01:41:13.262]  And using x-ray methods then, it tells you.
[01:41:13.875 --> 01:41:16.336]  And it's hard to explain over the radio.
[01:41:16.416 --> 01:41:20.597]  I think maybe it's better if I reserve the actual content.
[01:41:20.717 --> 01:41:26.379]  Doesn't it just create a spectrum of a graph of the different elements and combinations that it's made up of?
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:27.580]  Exactly.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.601]  Okay, what did you find then?
[01:41:31.401 --> 01:41:36.403]  Okay, I'll tell you some, but I want to hold most of this for the
[01:41:37.733 --> 01:41:39.335]  Uh, you know, UT Austin.
[01:41:39.635 --> 01:41:43.638]  I understand you also want to have it all published and put out correctly, but just, just, just give us a... Okay.
[01:41:44.178 --> 01:41:45.759]  Alright, I'll give you the bottom line.
[01:41:46.299 --> 01:41:51.643]  In these spheres, uh, we are seeing, of course, iron.
[01:41:51.863 --> 01:41:52.604]  We expect that.
[01:41:52.784 --> 01:41:58.288]  But already, though, you know, that's over 2,700 Fahrenheit to melt this iron.
[01:41:59.068 --> 01:42:01.370]  In addition, Alex, we see aluminum.
[01:42:03.332 --> 01:42:06.674]  Significant quantities of aluminum and sulfur
[01:42:08.477 --> 01:42:14.144]  You know, when I saw this, these data, I just thought, man, that's just what we expected.
[01:42:14.164 --> 01:42:17.828]  We see the same elements in the spheres from Therm8.
[01:42:20.331 --> 01:42:42.877]  Unbelievable, so this is, again, you look at what can cause the steel to melt and the clear 45 degree angle cuts, then you find thermate, then you find out that there is the explosive type used for cutting, patented, then you get multiple samples from different sites around the country
[01:42:43.737 --> 01:42:50.340]  Yes, and you do have the custody chain on that, then that matches what your hypothesis was.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.721]  In other words, it's all just dovetailing.
[01:42:53.041 --> 01:43:06.227]  And it just continues, and then you get the video from multiple choppers and on the ground of molten metal pouring out like water out of the towers, and then meanwhile Fox News says
[01:43:06.767 --> 01:43:08.708]  That's exactly right.
[01:43:08.748 --> 01:43:10.270]  These are tiny droplets of the order of 10
[01:43:24.705 --> 01:43:25.745]  50 microns.
[01:43:25.765 --> 01:43:29.327]  Of course, the one I saw was 1000 microns, a millimeter across.
[01:43:29.347 --> 01:43:30.888]  So you get all sizes.
[01:43:30.948 --> 01:43:37.932]  Does it tend to take some type of gaseous injection during the formation that's spewing these out?
[01:43:38.152 --> 01:43:48.558]  I mean, even if you saw steel brought to a melting point, you know, in a founder, you normally don't see huge spews of little circular gobulins flying out.
[01:43:48.578 --> 01:43:50.920]  I mean, does that fit in with the explosive reaction?
[01:43:51.565 --> 01:43:52.185]  Well, it does.
[01:43:52.766 --> 01:43:54.266]  Let me point this out.
[01:43:54.366 --> 01:43:56.987]  With Thermate, you can tailor this stuff.
[01:43:57.708 --> 01:44:01.389]  Ultra-fine is explosive, and then you get lots of little droplets.
[01:44:01.829 --> 01:44:06.712]  What we found is we used fine powders of aluminum and iron oxide.
[01:44:06.792 --> 01:44:12.974]  We added potassium permanganate, and that gave us a lot of droplets in the air, too.
[01:44:12.994 --> 01:44:16.716]  So, let me mention one of the things we did recently, Alex.
[01:44:16.856 --> 01:44:19.357]  You know, things are just coming along so rapidly.
[01:44:19.941 --> 01:44:29.829]  If you take ordinary thermite, then you get molten steel at a white-hot temperature over 2700 Fahrenheit, and it flows.
[01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:32.151]  And I've got a picture of this.
[01:44:32.511 --> 01:44:44.861]  And then if you let it drop on sand, typically is what we do in our demos here, you can pick up the white, yellow, white-hot iron, the residue, with tongs.
[01:44:45.021 --> 01:44:46.622]  Because, I mean, it solidifies.
[01:44:47.822 --> 01:44:50.083]  At around 2700 Fahrenheit.
[01:44:50.504 --> 01:44:54.346]  Now, the next thing we did then is to add sulfur.
[01:44:54.626 --> 01:44:57.427]  I said, let's add a lot of sulfur.
[01:44:57.467 --> 01:45:01.249]  We put about 15% sulfur in with the thermite.
[01:45:01.289 --> 01:45:02.310]  Now it becomes thermate.
[01:45:03.491 --> 01:45:09.894]  And just as expected, this stuff stays liquid.
[01:45:10.254 --> 01:45:12.936]  So even at orange hot temperature, it's still liquid.
[01:45:12.976 --> 01:45:14.777]  Now that's a very important point because
[01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:21.615]  I've had, well, for instance, Judy Wood, you know, said, well, how could you get the iron to flow at orange hot?
[01:45:21.995 --> 01:45:24.137]  The answer is with sulfur added.
[01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:25.057]  It's a good question.
[01:45:25.938 --> 01:45:28.080]  But, you know, there is an answer.
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.504]  And the answer is that when sulfur is added to iron, it makes a eutectic and it flows.
[01:45:33.984 --> 01:45:41.170]  And by the way, you have this confirmed by FEMA in this report, saying they had very unusual sulfidation.
[01:45:41.630 --> 01:45:42.511]  That's exactly right.
[01:45:42.551 --> 01:45:42.991]  Good point.
[01:45:43.789 --> 01:45:45.130]  Alex, I'd like to bring that in, too.
[01:45:45.810 --> 01:45:47.551]  WPI did a measurement on the steel.
[01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:54.455]  They found sulfidation, high temperature sulfidation, and they couldn't explain where that sulfur came from in their paper.
[01:45:54.495 --> 01:45:55.475]  You know, they published that.
[01:45:55.495 --> 01:46:06.541]  They said, well, here it is, but we do not explain these high temperatures and then the sulfur attacking the steel in this way and doing sulfidation, which weakens the steel, of course, and melts it.
[01:46:07.526 --> 01:46:12.770]  And so all of these facts are confirming very strongly the use of thermite.
[01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:20.756]  The other point there is that NIST, you know, should have looked for high temperature accelerants.
[01:46:20.796 --> 01:46:21.897]  This is a crime scene.
[01:46:21.937 --> 01:46:22.818]  It involved fire.
[01:46:23.338 --> 01:46:27.381]  The code, the NFPA 921 code, requires that they look for thermite.
[01:46:28.142 --> 01:46:28.762]  It's spelled out.
[01:46:28.983 --> 01:46:29.403]  Thermite.
[01:46:29.503 --> 01:46:29.883]  Look for it.
[01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:34.567]  Well, they said, well, we didn't look for thermite residues in the steel, and I'm saying,
[01:46:35.424 --> 01:46:37.105]  You know, that's part of the requirement.
[01:46:37.145 --> 01:46:37.845]  That's the code.
[01:46:38.746 --> 01:46:43.708]  And hopefully they will correct their inaction on that.
[01:46:43.948 --> 01:46:54.233]  I shouldn't be the only one that has to... Not that I'm the only one, but I mean... It should be NIST and the FBI doing this, setting this as the crime scene.
[01:46:55.925 --> 01:47:01.426]  There's definitely now evidence for the use of aluminothermics, as we call it.
[01:47:01.626 --> 01:47:05.307]  So the science continues to concur and stack up.
[01:47:05.347 --> 01:47:06.187]  Very much.
[01:47:06.387 --> 01:47:11.168]  And of course, you'll obviously have video, photos, slides, and be able to show photographs.
[01:47:11.548 --> 01:47:15.169]  And that's coming up next weekend, April 14th and 15th.
[01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:20.430]  Not this weekend, in two days, but the week after here in Austin, Texas.
[01:47:20.530 --> 01:47:22.610]  The last time we had just a three-hour event
[01:47:24.148 --> 01:47:30.276]  Uh, that I spoke at at the University of Texas a few months ago, and a thousand people showed up.
[01:47:30.316 --> 01:47:31.537]  They had to turn away hundreds.
[01:47:32.358 --> 01:47:41.990]  I've been asking how many this holds, and I believe we're going to have the gentleman on from PNAC, Project for New American Citizens,
[01:47:42.630 --> 01:47:54.513]  That is a takeoff on PNAC, Project for a New American Century, and this is going to be starting next Saturday at 11 a.m.
[01:47:54.693 --> 01:48:02.475]  going until in the evening, and then it's going to be on Sunday from 10 a.m.
[01:48:02.555 --> 01:48:05.616]  until the evening, and I've been asked to emcee it, but
[01:48:07.199 --> 01:48:11.103]  I already had to do interviews with NBC News that's coming in for a two-hour documentary.
[01:48:11.123 --> 01:48:13.526]  They're going to kill two birds with one stone and also interview Jones.
[01:48:13.546 --> 01:48:18.791]  There will be a few emcees and I don't like to hog things and so I'll be speaking Saturday night.
[01:48:19.532 --> 01:48:21.174]  Have they told you when you're speaking, Professor Jones?
[01:48:22.327 --> 01:48:24.529]  Yeah, Saturday evening also.
[01:48:24.549 --> 01:48:26.170]  In fact, I think I follow you.
[01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:29.973]  I did that in Chicago, you remember?
[01:48:29.993 --> 01:48:31.054]  You're going to do a great job.
[01:48:31.074 --> 01:48:31.894]  What are you talking about?
[01:48:31.934 --> 01:48:32.375]  Well, thanks.
[01:48:32.475 --> 01:48:32.895]  It's hard.
[01:48:32.955 --> 01:48:34.016]  It's hard to follow Alex.
[01:48:34.036 --> 01:48:38.859]  I'm down at 710 then, so you'll be on right after 730 or so.
[01:48:38.879 --> 01:48:40.300]  Folks, this is the University of Texas, RM.
[01:48:45.124 --> 01:48:52.947]  We're going to get a banner up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with this.
[01:48:53.567 --> 01:49:01.651]  It's PNAC Citizens.org and it's sponsored by Brave New Books of Austin.
[01:49:02.211 --> 01:49:04.793]  Protest the Empire, 5 p.m.
[01:49:04.933 --> 01:49:07.274]  at the main mall, UT Tower.
[01:49:07.695 --> 01:49:15.560]  So I guess it goes late on Saturday, ends early on Sunday, and I'm going to scurry off and do my Sunday syndicated radio show.
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:17.161]  So it's going to be jam-packed.
[01:49:17.481 --> 01:49:24.546]  Come all and please especially come for the protest demonstration that's going to be on Sunday, even if you can't make it into the hall.
[01:49:25.226 --> 01:49:32.532]  I don't know how many this haul holds, but I've got a sneaking suspicion, with even really no promotion, that it's going to be gangbusters.
[01:49:32.572 --> 01:49:38.737]  So I can't wait to see Professor Jones here in Austin, Texas, deep in the heart of the resistance, coming up next week.
[01:49:38.917 --> 01:49:42.179]  We're going to jam in some phone calls for the professor on the other side.
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.581]  Maybe keep him five minutes to the next hour.
[01:49:43.761 --> 01:49:47.724]  Then we've got William Rodriguez joining us, and the PNAC boys as well.
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.944]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:00.324 --> 01:50:07.969]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:08.658 --> 01:50:15.720]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.121 --> 01:50:27.544]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:27.844 --> 01:50:31.506]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:31.806 --> 01:50:33.746]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:34.067 --> 01:50:37.928]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.128 --> 01:51:01.217]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as Triamethylenes, Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:01.457 --> 01:51:12.687]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:13.027 --> 01:51:17.852]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,

[01:52:45.952 --> 01:52:46.573]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091
[01:52:57.082 --> 01:52:58.703]  By the way, there have been 21,000 signatures.
[01:52:58.723 --> 01:52:59.964]  And that's why it crashed the system.
[01:52:59.984 --> 01:53:01.225]  Last night it was a couple thousand.
[01:53:01.245 --> 01:53:02.585]  I went to bed, it was crashed this morning.
[01:53:02.645 --> 01:53:05.407]  People were able to sign up, you just couldn't see the petition.
[01:53:05.427 --> 01:53:06.488]  They went and retrieved it. 21,000.
[01:53:24.122 --> 01:53:25.063]  We're good to go.
[01:53:40.456 --> 01:53:50.084]  Uh, and so, you're talking about like 12 hours or so, and it's got 21,000, or 14 hours or so, 21,000 signatures.
[01:53:50.444 --> 01:53:53.367]  The neocons with their Fox News show only have a few thousand.
[01:53:53.847 --> 01:53:59.032]  They're like, shut her down, get her on, get her.
[01:53:59.052 --> 01:53:59.732]  21,000 plus signatures.
[01:54:00.093 --> 01:54:02.835]  Keep signing, we're going to send them all to ABC News.
[01:54:03.553 --> 01:54:05.975]  Uh, don't forget, uh, Terror Storm.
[01:54:06.035 --> 01:54:18.223]  It's free on Google Video, but if you want the high quality DVD and to support what we're doing here, get the history of government-sponsored terror, Terror Storm, at Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:54:18.423 --> 01:54:21.525]  I had my whole call list here and it just erased in front of me.
[01:54:21.665 --> 01:54:23.486]  Uh, who's up first here for Professor Jones?
[01:54:25.388 --> 01:54:27.149]  Richard in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:54:28.547 --> 01:54:29.147]  Hello, Alex.
[01:54:29.347 --> 01:54:30.108]  A couple of things.
[01:54:30.308 --> 01:54:43.314]  One, I wanted to mention that on the Jon Stewart Show on Comedy Central earlier this week, he spent a very serious, approximately two minutes, going through false flag terrorism and saying that
[01:54:43.994 --> 01:54:50.658]  It's clear that these false flag events have taken place in the Middle East and that makes me wonder what else has gone on.
[01:54:50.678 --> 01:54:54.300]  Wait a minute, that's another huge, giant headline.
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:57.362]  What day did Stuart say this?
[01:54:57.782 --> 01:54:59.743]  I'm pretty sure it was Monday night, Alex.
[01:55:00.023 --> 01:55:01.004]  Monday night?
[01:55:01.404 --> 01:55:02.865]  Hold on, that's another massive...
[01:55:03.465 --> 01:55:05.128]  See, folks, we're missing everything.
[01:55:05.428 --> 01:55:06.389]  And he was serious.
[01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:11.176]  That's a comedy show, but he didn't crack a smile during that, and it was like two minutes long.
[01:55:11.236 --> 01:55:13.059]  So it was like during his little comment section.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:13.660]  Yes.
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.142]  See, that's a massive headline.
[01:55:15.182 --> 01:55:18.347]  Jon Stewart goes public on government-sponsored terror or on false flag.
[01:55:18.367 --> 01:55:19.648]  I'm getting Paul Watson on right now.
[01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:24.173]  We did this with the Building 7 when a listener alerted us that BBC had reported.
[01:55:24.414 --> 01:55:31.101]  Paul, we got a caller and he sounds credible just like last time a caller told us about BBC reporting Building 7 had fallen before it did.
[01:55:31.461 --> 01:55:35.806]  We just got a call saying Jon Stewart did two minutes on false flag terror Monday night.
[01:55:36.046 --> 01:55:37.067]  You've got to find that.
[01:55:37.728 --> 01:55:41.732]  Paul, what's the main email for folks who can help find it and get it to you?
[01:55:44.924 --> 01:55:49.229]  Watson at PrisonPlanet.com, or they can post it in the general comments section to help you, okay?
[01:55:49.449 --> 01:55:50.310]  Get on it right now!
[01:55:50.530 --> 01:55:52.512]  Launch the operation, I'll see ya!
[01:55:53.172 --> 01:55:55.154]  Okay, sorry, go ahead.
[01:55:56.276 --> 01:55:57.497]  Hello?
[01:55:57.897 --> 01:55:58.858]  Professor Jones was commenting.
[01:55:58.878 --> 01:56:00.460]  Would you like to comment on this, sir?
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:01.801]  I think it's great.
[01:56:01.941 --> 01:56:04.904]  There's all these revelations, it's hard to keep up with them.
[01:56:05.084 --> 01:56:05.625]  But go ahead.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.461]  One other quick thing, Alex.
[01:56:08.501 --> 01:56:20.731]  There have been some pictures posted about a week ago, roughly, on the Rents website that showed cars and fire trucks and all that sort of thing along FDR Drive, which is quite a distance from the World Trade Center complex.
[01:56:21.052 --> 01:56:23.594]  And these things were melted and melted in weird ways.
[01:56:23.634 --> 01:56:28.938]  And I'm not trying to promote any kind of a beam technology, but I'm wondering if you guys have seen that and any comments.
[01:56:28.958 --> 01:56:31.620]  Yeah, I've seen that and I've seen explanations for it.
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.261]  Professor Jones?
[01:56:32.881 --> 01:56:33.722]  Excellent question.
[01:56:36.164 --> 01:56:58.697]  Two papers in the Journal of 9-1-1 studies that talk about this and show that this is consistent with thermate damage to cars and then later these cars being towed to FDR Drive because that's where they were going to be put on a... Yeah, that's the intel I've seen is this is days after and the streets obviously for months had dust and they've hauled them out and you can see that.
[01:57:01.079 --> 01:57:02.860]  But then again, there's a lot of disinfo going on.
[01:57:03.462 --> 01:57:04.463]  Yeah, be careful about that.
[01:57:04.663 --> 01:57:07.626]  But there's some good papers that discuss that thoroughly in the journal.
[01:57:08.026 --> 01:57:14.673]  Look for James Gurley and Greg Jenkins.
[01:57:14.873 --> 01:57:18.376]  Professor Jones is going to be here in Austin, Texas next week.
[01:57:18.416 --> 01:57:20.258]  We've got the young men coming on right now.
[01:57:20.318 --> 01:57:21.579]  They'll talk to Professor Jones.
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:23.861]  And then I don't want to twist his arm too bad.
[01:57:23.881 --> 01:57:27.004]  I almost want to keep him on Willie Rodriguez so we can take calls then.
[01:57:27.044 --> 01:57:28.946]  But we're going to move quick on the other side.
[01:57:31.403 --> 01:57:36.431]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:47.452 --> 01:57:48.113]  Big Brother.
[01:57:48.773 --> 01:57:49.814]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.555 --> 01:57:51.636]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.296 --> 01:57:53.117]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.878 --> 01:57:54.799]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.439 --> 01:57:59.103]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.623 --> 01:58:03.747]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:04.608 --> 01:58:09.032]  Tens of thousands of people are on the website, TheFinRosie.com.
[01:58:09.072 --> 01:58:12.255]  Links to it on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:12.395 --> 01:58:13.676]  We've got Matt Dayton and others.
[01:58:14.661 --> 01:58:19.941]  From Project for New American Citizens, joining us, the big event coming up next week at UT Austin, which
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:23.101]  We're going to find out how many people it really seats.
[01:58:23.241 --> 01:58:24.542]  They better try to get a bigger room.
[01:58:24.622 --> 01:58:26.384]  I mean, you could probably get 3,000 people in there.
[01:58:26.404 --> 01:58:31.968]  I mean, if I don't even promote something and 1,000 show up and they turn away a couple hundred, this is going to be a three-ring circus.
[01:58:32.288 --> 01:58:36.972]  But I don't want that to discourage you from coming because they've got a bunch of other rooms, I'm told, and we'll give you the details.
[01:58:36.992 --> 01:58:39.254]  William Rod Riggles will be with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:58:39.274 --> 01:58:40.194]  We're almost out of time.
[01:58:41.095 --> 01:58:43.897]  But real fast, let's get to Kyle in Iowa.
[01:58:44.177 --> 01:58:45.698]  You're on with Professor Stephen Jones.
[01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:46.059]  Go ahead.
[01:58:47.395 --> 01:58:47.956]  Go ahead.
[01:58:48.356 --> 01:58:48.996]  Am I on the air?
[01:58:49.136 --> 01:58:49.657]  Yes, you are.
[01:58:50.077 --> 01:58:50.477]  Oh, good.
[01:58:50.558 --> 01:58:51.258]  Okay.
[01:58:52.439 --> 01:58:52.999]  Wow, okay.
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:59:06.070]  I just want to make one point, and I don't know if I've ever heard you make this point before, but for a lot of people who doubt that fire could have melted these things, I want to point out one thing.
[01:59:06.450 --> 01:59:15.497]  These engines that are in these airplanes, if they're made out of steel, how do they make these transcontinental flights over and over with little or no maintenance?
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:17.601]  That's a good point.
[01:59:18.021 --> 01:59:23.045]  And also even your wood-burning stove and kerosene stove.
[01:59:23.405 --> 01:59:25.186]  Jet fuel is a type of kerosene.
[01:59:25.526 --> 01:59:31.731]  I have a kerosene stove and it's steel and I'm not worried about that puppy melting, you know, anytime soon.
[01:59:31.751 --> 01:59:32.812]  So you raise a good point.
[01:59:32.872 --> 01:59:35.574]  Even jet engines don't melt.
[01:59:36.214 --> 01:59:36.434]  Right.
[01:59:36.474 --> 01:59:43.920]  Well, I've been doing some research on this myself and I noticed that it was saying that on an open air burn, actually, of
[01:59:44.835 --> 01:59:46.717]  Or an uncontrolled burn of jet fuel.
[01:59:46.757 --> 01:59:51.161]  It's roughly going to be between 5 and 600 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:59:51.341 --> 01:59:57.387]  Yeah, when we say 1800, that is the maximum with air injected in a turbo condition.
[01:59:57.807 --> 01:59:58.228]  Okay.
[01:59:58.388 --> 02:00:00.610]  Or like liquid oxygen or something like that.
[02:00:01.391 --> 02:00:02.512]  Professor, you want to comment on that?
[02:00:03.152 --> 02:00:05.154]  Yeah, those numbers are reasonable.
[02:00:05.234 --> 02:00:08.037]  And remember, to melt steel would require
[02:00:08.983 --> 02:00:12.605]  Uh, right around 2800 Fahrenheit.
[02:00:12.925 --> 02:00:15.086]  1538 centigrade is typical for structural steel.
[02:00:15.406 --> 02:00:17.467]  So you're nowhere near the temperatures.
[02:00:17.567 --> 02:00:20.228]  And NIST, to their credit, does point that out.
[02:00:20.688 --> 02:00:25.950]  But then, how do they explain this molten metal seen pouring out of the South Tower just minutes before its collapse?
[02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:27.631]  Well, they're hard put.
[02:00:27.691 --> 02:00:31.332]  They do talk about aluminum, and I've shown that aluminum is silvery.
[02:00:32.033 --> 02:00:32.613]  I and others
[02:00:34.047 --> 02:00:36.648]  It also cools quickly and flakes and turns white.
[02:00:36.668 --> 02:00:38.829]  This stuff stays yellow for a long time.
[02:00:54.577 --> 02:00:58.500]  Contains so much information, it's like... Because it proves it isn't aluminum!
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:01.082]  You've got the steel droplets!
[02:01:01.602 --> 02:01:02.502]  It is, yeah.
[02:01:02.723 --> 02:01:09.367]  Now, it's not, I wouldn't call it steel either, although I understand the term, Alex, but these are, it's a mixture... It's an alloy.
[02:01:10.308 --> 02:01:14.471]  It's what you see in thermate residue, which gives you droplets also.
[02:01:14.831 --> 02:01:16.352]  So that's what I'll be showing at UT.
[02:01:16.412 --> 02:01:18.133]  Is alloy the proper term?
[02:01:18.173 --> 02:01:19.454]  I mean, is it a mixture of things?
[02:01:19.594 --> 02:01:20.715]  It's a mixture of metals.
[02:01:21.315 --> 02:01:21.776]  It's fairly
[02:01:22.897 --> 02:01:24.939]  It's what you get with thermate.
[02:01:24.959 --> 02:01:29.642]  You get these droplets that form, and I'm talking about thermate with potassium permanganate added.
[02:01:29.902 --> 02:01:34.005]  I'll show you why later in UT Austin.
[02:01:34.265 --> 02:01:44.152]  But anyway, the point is you get these droplets and they contain the information of where they came from as you look at these then and interrogate with x-rays.
[02:01:45.288 --> 02:01:46.469]  Well, this is unbelievable.
[02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:54.793]  I can't wait to videotape your presentation and get it up on the web immediately once you get to town and give the presentation next Saturday night, Professor.
[02:01:55.274 --> 02:02:01.837]  God bless you and Godspeed, and hopefully after the presentation we can sneak off and I can take you guys to dinner.
[02:02:02.398 --> 02:02:04.619]  Yeah, let me just draw on one thing, Alex.
[02:02:04.659 --> 02:02:08.261]  Since this is at the University of Texas, I would invite
[02:02:08.974 --> 02:02:14.499]  I mean, I'd look at this as a scientific colloquium.
[02:02:14.819 --> 02:02:21.105]  I'll be a little more technical on this one than I have, at least in part, because I want to get into these data and show the spectra.
[02:02:21.681 --> 02:02:24.343]  Well, you won't have me interrupting and you'll have visual aids.
[02:02:25.784 --> 02:02:32.550]  And I know that Matt and others involved with the student group are inviting all of the engineering staff and the science staff.
[02:02:33.210 --> 02:02:35.492]  Professor, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:02:35.992 --> 02:02:36.273]  Great.
[02:02:36.553 --> 02:02:37.153]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:37.213 --> 02:02:37.934]  Always a pleasure.
[02:02:38.114 --> 02:02:38.574]  God bless.
[02:02:38.594 --> 02:02:39.235]  See you next week.
[02:02:39.595 --> 02:02:41.617]  We'll be right back with William Rodriguez and...
[02:02:46.181 --> 02:02:51.646]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:52.026 --> 02:02:59.633]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:00.345 --> 02:03:07.409]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:07.810 --> 02:03:19.237]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:19.537 --> 02:03:23.179]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:23.499 --> 02:03:25.460]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:29.623]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:42.961 --> 02:03:43.741]  Terrorism!
[02:03:43.882 --> 02:03:44.622]  Terrorism!
[02:03:44.742 --> 02:03:50.805]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:51.045 --> 02:03:52.646]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:52.906 --> 02:03:55.367]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:55.747 --> 02:04:10.315]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:10.355 --> 02:04:10.675]  government.
[02:04:10.855 --> 02:04:12.656]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:13.036 --> 02:04:18.940]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:23.583]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:04:42.850 --> 02:04:44.571]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:04:44.732 --> 02:04:46.053]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:04:46.233 --> 02:04:49.035]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:52.177]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:04:52.718 --> 02:04:59.463]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:05:29.187 --> 02:05:32.308]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:32.368 --> 02:05:33.809]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.879 --> 02:05:59.100]  Well, he's an amazing individual.
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:00.680]  He's William Rodriguez.
[02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:23.006]  And riding shotgun with him for this segment is going to be Matt Dayton, another amazing individual, who heads up a student group on UT that's had, I don't know, 10, 20 big demonstrations with hundreds of people, had an event that I was at that had over 1,900 in there, hundreds that tried to get in, and got covered by the newspapers and TV and stuff.
[02:06:24.048 --> 02:06:26.090]  They've had other events with 400, 500 people.
[02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:29.752]  They've got one coming up next week with Steven Jones, Webster Tarpley, myself and others.
[02:06:29.772 --> 02:06:31.734]  I'm going to be an interesting part of it and speaking.
[02:06:33.115 --> 02:06:33.875]  That's all coming up.
[02:06:35.136 --> 02:06:37.638]  I was thinking I was going to try to get Willie in, but he's so busy.
[02:06:40.075 --> 02:06:47.178]  My big concern is that I'm told the hall only holds 550 people, but there's side rooms next to it that I guess they might be able to put TVs in.
[02:06:48.499 --> 02:06:54.561]  Matt, I'm going to tell you right now, and I know you guys got this hall booked before you had the other event, so you didn't know how big this would get.
[02:06:54.581 --> 02:07:04.225]  I'm not tooting my horn, but if this show is promoting it, with all our great listeners out there that really do the promoting, Matt Dayton with Project for New American Citizens.
[02:07:06.741 --> 02:07:07.521]  What are we going to do here?
[02:07:07.561 --> 02:07:10.143]  Because if we do promote this, it's going to go supernova.
[02:07:10.443 --> 02:07:14.185]  But then if we say, oh, it's going to go supernova, then people won't come because they think they won't be able to get in.
[02:07:14.766 --> 02:07:20.189]  Regardless, Sunday there's a demonstration downtown, so everybody should come to that bottom line.
[02:07:20.209 --> 02:07:22.130]  And there's going to be some other events around town.
[02:07:22.150 --> 02:07:23.891]  But Matt, fill us in on what's happening.
[02:07:24.451 --> 02:07:26.573]  OK, well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:07:26.893 --> 02:07:32.836]  And yeah, I mean, the biggest room that we could get was this was this Berdyne 106 room.
[02:07:34.351 --> 02:07:39.652]  The room that we had you in, which was the ballroom, we could not get that booked.
[02:07:39.892 --> 02:07:42.132]  That gets booked way in advance.
[02:07:42.172 --> 02:07:43.793]  We just looked out when we got you in there.
[02:07:45.253 --> 02:07:48.434]  So what we're going to try and do is, you know, we're going to have the conference.
[02:07:48.454 --> 02:07:49.494]  It's going to be two days.
[02:07:50.274 --> 02:08:01.136]  I have a feeling people aren't going to want to stay the entire day for both days, so that's going to hopefully help us out with the numbers, and then we're going to have some spillover rooms in order to
[02:08:02.037 --> 02:08:13.741]  Either try and broadcast live what's happening in the main room, or if we have some of our speakers who are willing to maybe give another lecture in those other rooms, or in that other room that we have.
[02:08:14.241 --> 02:08:15.221]  How big is the other room?
[02:08:16.282 --> 02:08:19.923]  It'll be probably around another hundred, or a couple hundred.
[02:08:22.184 --> 02:08:22.664]  Okay.
[02:08:22.684 --> 02:08:25.705]  You know what's going to happen?
[02:08:25.725 --> 02:08:28.846]  All these people are going to show up, and UT's pretty nice, at least their staff are.
[02:08:29.186 --> 02:08:31.507]  They're probably going to accommodate, and they're going to open more up.
[02:08:32.108 --> 02:08:36.009]  Okay, yeah, I mean, we're doing the best we can.
[02:08:36.949 --> 02:08:37.569]  Are you kidding?
[02:08:37.609 --> 02:08:39.029]  No, you guys are super!
[02:08:39.450 --> 02:08:40.290]  You're my heroes.
[02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:44.210]  I love how you're taking action, taking the bull by the horns, getting involved.
[02:08:44.911 --> 02:08:48.571]  I mean, for Stephen Jones coming in alone, you'd probably get 800 people.
[02:08:48.951 --> 02:08:51.492]  With me, now you're promoting at 1,000.
[02:08:52.392 --> 02:08:55.353]  With Tarpley, hundreds and hundreds of people love Tarpley.
[02:08:55.573 --> 02:08:56.393]  You've got more people.
[02:08:57.328 --> 02:09:00.670]  Just to make darn sure, I got a couple seats saved for my camera guys.
[02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:03.591]  This is going to be awesome, my friend.
[02:09:03.611 --> 02:09:04.551]  This is going to be great.
[02:09:04.571 --> 02:09:08.753]  But we want everybody to come, because the ticker here is this thing's free, isn't it?
[02:09:09.153 --> 02:09:10.314]  Yes, it's free.
[02:09:12.114 --> 02:09:18.817]  We wanted to make this free because we wanted to encourage as many people who aren't necessarily interested in the topic.
[02:09:18.857 --> 02:09:24.960]  So we didn't want to discourage people who are fence sitters, because we know we would get
[02:09:25.690 --> 02:09:37.913]  A bunch of people who love Steven Jones and who are totally on board with this information, but we wanted to try and do something to get more people, and that's hopefully what we'll do.
[02:09:38.733 --> 02:09:50.196]  We do have the option of, we know people really want to come to this event, so we've made it the option that you can reserve a spot
[02:09:50.908 --> 02:09:51.268]  I think so.
[02:10:14.864 --> 02:10:44.570]  donations uh... from our listener are from you know people who are going to come to the event and also just uh... basically the matter you're getting out of you said people can reserve it you're gonna have five hundred and fifty reserve in two minutes well i give up a contact point for that uh... basically uh... uh... on our website at p n a citizen dot org uh... you can you know donate there and see the uh... the tentative schedule of of the speaker that we're gonna have uh... for uh... saturday and sunday
[02:10:46.361 --> 02:10:51.323]  Well, it's going to be amazing, and I can't wait to see you there, and I appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:52.303]  Give out the website again.
[02:10:52.583 --> 02:10:58.905]  It's PNACITIZEN.ORG, so that's P-N-A-C-I-T-I-Z-E-N, so P-N-A-C-I-T-I-Z-E-N.ORG.
[02:10:59.265 --> 02:11:01.886]  Okay, well, it's going to be big, and I appreciate you joining us.
[02:11:02.266 --> 02:11:03.007]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[02:11:03.547 --> 02:11:05.087]  Alright, let's go to William Rodriguez.
[02:11:05.127 --> 02:11:06.948]  I appreciate joining us today.
[02:11:07.488 --> 02:11:09.609]  By the way, we're now carrying his new film,
[02:11:10.734 --> 02:11:21.002]  It's a compilation of the unbelievably strong presentation he gave at the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium in June of last year, shot with, I believe, five cameras.
[02:11:21.582 --> 02:11:24.064]  Two of it's our shots, then three other cameras he had.
[02:11:25.245 --> 02:11:27.046]  And just an amazing presentation.
[02:11:27.066 --> 02:11:30.348]  In fact, I meant to edit it together and put it out, never had time.
[02:11:31.559 --> 02:11:32.420]  I'm glad he did.
[02:11:32.941 --> 02:11:38.007]  We're now carrying that and it's available on the online shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:38.468 --> 02:11:43.254]  He is the last civilian survivor of the towers.
[02:11:43.394 --> 02:11:49.863]  He went up with the key to open the different landings and doorways with the police and firemen.
[02:11:51.577 --> 02:11:53.458]  And he's just an amazing individual.
[02:11:53.678 --> 02:11:55.639]  Oh, I meant to send this to the network for when he came on.
[02:11:55.679 --> 02:11:56.479]  I forgot to send the clip.
[02:11:56.779 --> 02:12:01.741]  I'll go find the YouTube clip and get it up to the network, because this is an example.
[02:12:01.841 --> 02:12:12.686]  All over TV where he goes, when he gets ready to say, and then there were explosions with bombs going off, they cut it and go, there were explosions, and then they cut and say, then the plane caused the explosion.
[02:12:13.166 --> 02:12:14.046]  Very deceptive.
[02:12:16.369 --> 02:12:19.631]  Again, just an amazing individual and we're honored to have him.
[02:12:20.812 --> 02:12:21.852]  William, thanks for coming on.
[02:12:21.872 --> 02:12:23.633]  Thank you for having me.
[02:12:23.773 --> 02:12:32.058]  It's very important that you mention that because I found that clip because of the amount of presentations that I did on September the 11th last year.
[02:12:32.419 --> 02:12:34.480]  I haven't been able to digitize everything.
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:43.105]  When I saw that, I was so appalled by the manipulation and the editing of the content just to fit what their views are.
[02:12:43.553 --> 02:12:49.138]  You see how cleverly they caught on the right moment, and everybody knows the story out there.
[02:12:49.799 --> 02:12:53.843]  And they just go into establishing that it was a plane, what I heard first.
[02:12:53.863 --> 02:12:57.426]  It's just so funny because they cut the whole sentence out.
[02:12:57.886 --> 02:13:08.256]  And you see, even though they did a nice profile in the general clip, you see that it did fit whatever they wanted to put out there.
[02:13:08.656 --> 02:13:11.417]  But the real story was never out.
[02:13:11.717 --> 02:13:12.557]  It's incredible.
[02:13:12.577 --> 02:13:14.298]  And this is ABC News.
[02:13:14.838 --> 02:13:18.640]  And that shows you how they choose and pick whatever they want.
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:23.521]  We posted a clip a few days ago on PrisonPlanet.com when you sent it to us.
[02:13:23.641 --> 02:13:28.423]  Yeah, they can go to YouTube and type William Rodriguez, ABC, and they will get it.
[02:13:28.943 --> 02:13:39.110]  Okay, then let me just tell the network, William Rodriguez, ABC, and it just starts with Willie at Ground Zero, and he's sitting there going, and then there was a big explosion, and they cut and go, and the plane hit.
[02:13:39.531 --> 02:13:40.732]  What did you really say?
[02:13:40.752 --> 02:13:51.559]  I said there was a huge explosion that pushed us upwards, and at that moment I felt it was a bomb or something explosive-like that blew up onto the basement.
[02:13:51.939 --> 02:13:55.722]  And then when I went to verbalize it, I heard the impact of the plane all the way on the top.
[02:13:55.802 --> 02:13:56.683]  They cut all that part.
[02:13:59.646 --> 02:14:02.942]  They just use whatever they want just to put out...
[02:14:03.328 --> 02:14:11.334]  You see, it has been an experience for the last five years, how they have taken my story and they have manipulated.
[02:14:11.794 --> 02:14:29.226]  Actually, I am putting together hours and hours, we're talking about hundreds of hours of interviews that I've done, and digitizing them all at once to be able to put it out there so people will see that, you know, I've been telling the same story from the very beginning and people keep manipulating the whole thing.
[02:14:29.853 --> 02:14:34.819]  Well, some folks will go get the news that's cut you up, and then say, oh, well, Willie didn't say.
[02:14:34.839 --> 02:14:36.080]  In fact, the neocons do that.
[02:14:36.301 --> 02:14:37.782]  Well, they have done that.
[02:14:37.822 --> 02:14:41.327]  Willie has said a plane hit it, and now it's the reporter.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.580]  They say that constantly, yes.
[02:14:43.601 --> 02:14:49.542]  Oh, he didn't say this, or he didn't mention that, or he said one thing and then he said another thing.
[02:14:49.882 --> 02:14:56.564]  You know, they manipulate that for their own needs just to debate me, but they don't debate me directly.
[02:14:56.584 --> 02:15:01.026]  They say, if you want to get the real stuff, get the real raw footage from the networks.
[02:15:01.386 --> 02:15:02.346]  You will never get it.
[02:15:02.526 --> 02:15:03.707]  I want to get back into this.
[02:15:03.747 --> 02:15:04.687]  We're going to get the clip.
[02:15:04.707 --> 02:15:06.327]  We're going to play it coming up today.
[02:15:06.347 --> 02:15:07.788]  In about ten minutes or so, we'll have it.
[02:15:07.808 --> 02:15:08.288]  We'll play it.
[02:15:08.788 --> 02:15:11.469]  But before we go to break, Willie, let's get into 9-11 Truth Itself.
[02:15:12.209 --> 02:15:18.197]  I know you can't say too much, but Rosie O'Donnell, all the things that are happening, where do you see this going?
[02:15:18.217 --> 02:15:19.699]  I mean, are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing?
[02:15:19.719 --> 02:15:20.701]  This is make it or break it.
[02:15:21.001 --> 02:15:25.207]  We're exploding exponentially, but they're trying to set the precedent by getting her fired.
[02:15:26.281 --> 02:15:39.571]  They are trying to make her not only an icon of the negativity that is out there, they are attacking her, they are calling for her death, basically, on national television, and these people are not being prosecuted.
[02:15:40.591 --> 02:15:46.776]  They are hypocrites, because they have attacked this woman for just asking questions.
[02:15:46.956 --> 02:15:48.797]  All she did was ask questions.
[02:15:49.238 --> 02:15:50.679]  I definitely, 100% support
[02:15:52.842 --> 02:15:58.209]  Rosie O'Donnell, I have written directly to the producers of The O'Reilly Factor.
[02:15:58.510 --> 02:15:59.791]  They have not called me back.
[02:15:59.831 --> 02:16:08.523]  They don't want me to be on the show because, you know, how do you get a survivor, a person that was inside the building to support Rosie
[02:16:10.109 --> 02:16:13.011]  The show will be amazingly on our favor.
[02:16:13.551 --> 02:16:14.551]  You see, they don't want that.
[02:16:14.591 --> 02:16:15.212]  They don't need that.
[02:16:15.232 --> 02:16:16.172]  They want to attack.
[02:16:16.492 --> 02:16:18.113]  They are so nervous.
[02:16:18.513 --> 02:16:21.475]  They are shaking on their hands.
[02:16:21.655 --> 02:16:23.256]  You can see the fear, can't you?
[02:16:24.088 --> 02:16:24.928]  Oh, yes, definitely.
[02:16:25.008 --> 02:16:26.409]  I'm seeing better in their eyes, aren't you?
[02:16:27.169 --> 02:16:34.312]  Oh, well, you know, what I've seen here from the very beginning is what I've been seeing for the last four and a half years.
[02:16:34.692 --> 02:16:40.835]  But now I feel that they are so nervous that the truth is coming out that they want to attack anybody that comes out.
[02:16:41.365 --> 02:16:48.087]  You see, the people that have been out, like you, me, other survivors, firemen, they don't attack them.
[02:16:48.127 --> 02:16:52.968]  They don't even acknowledge our existence because we've been at it from the very beginning.
[02:16:53.008 --> 02:17:03.550]  But it's also the key to them to keep the illusion going that the firemen and police and heroes, like William Rodriguez, are all buying into the Al Qaeda did it story.
[02:17:03.590 --> 02:17:04.830]  Does it ever make you sick?
[02:17:04.850 --> 02:17:07.371]  And I want your answers after the break, Willie.
[02:17:08.172 --> 02:17:28.125]  And it makes me sick, and I'm not a hero like you are on 9-11, it makes me sick to see them wrap themselves in the dead, wrap themselves in the people that the military-industrial complex killed, and then claim that all the victims agree with them, when Bill Doyle, who lost his son Joey, says the majority of his group, the biggest group, he's the head of it, believe it's an inside job.
[02:17:28.165 --> 02:17:30.647]  We'll get William Rodriguez's take on that, because I never ask him this.
[02:17:31.348 --> 02:17:33.471]  Even publicly or privately, what is it like?
[02:17:33.491 --> 02:17:35.535]  I mean, we've actually got a hero, a victim here.
[02:17:36.116 --> 02:17:39.521]  What is it like to see the killers using people like him?
[02:17:39.541 --> 02:17:40.463]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.933 --> 02:17:56.197]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:17:56.417 --> 02:18:02.860]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:03.721]  We're good to go!
[02:18:26.138 --> 02:18:28.241]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:18:28.301 --> 02:18:30.283]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[02:18:30.343 --> 02:18:30.984]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:31.024 --> 02:18:31.344]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:31.384 --> 02:18:32.926]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:32.986 --> 02:18:33.907]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:44.836 --> 02:18:45.877]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:46.277 --> 02:18:51.759]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:52.840]  That's right.
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:55.441]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:55.761 --> 02:19:02.925]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:03.485 --> 02:19:11.196]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:11.636 --> 02:19:16.423]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:22.125]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:22.905 --> 02:19:27.049]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:27.429 --> 02:19:27.670]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:27.690 --> 02:19:29.631]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:29.691 --> 02:19:29.992]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.292 --> 02:19:30.572]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:42.785 --> 02:19:47.733]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:19:48.053 --> 02:19:49.936]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:19:50.136 --> 02:19:53.181]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:19:53.361 --> 02:19:56.506]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:19:56.806 --> 02:19:58.649]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:19:58.909 --> 02:20:02.614]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:20:02.895 --> 02:20:05.558]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:20:06.179 --> 02:20:10.485]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:20:10.685 --> 02:20:14.931]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:20:15.371 --> 02:20:19.694]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:20:19.994 --> 02:20:24.256]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:20:24.596 --> 02:20:30.460]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:33.201]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:20:33.401 --> 02:20:34.222]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:20:34.242 --> 02:20:35.582]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:20:42.859 --> 02:20:43.439]  It's a fact.
[02:20:43.639 --> 02:20:48.060]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:53.601]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:20:53.881 --> 02:20:57.082]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[02:20:57.342 --> 02:21:04.483]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:21:04.804 --> 02:21:11.985]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:21:12.245 --> 02:21:14.346]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[02:21:14.747 --> 02:21:21.091]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[02:21:21.311 --> 02:21:25.134]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[02:21:25.454 --> 02:21:28.016]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[02:21:28.076 --> 02:21:28.896]  to 5 p.m.
[02:21:28.956 --> 02:21:30.177]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[02:21:30.197 --> 02:21:30.417]  That's 920-293-8024.
[02:21:30.437 --> 02:21:31.278]  And ask for Robert.
[02:21:31.298 --> 02:21:32.799]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[02:21:45.846 --> 02:21:49.987]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:21:50.047 --> 02:21:54.029]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:21:54.909 --> 02:21:58.350]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[02:21:58.450 --> 02:22:01.591]  And when you're out there, without care, yeah I was out of touch.
[02:22:01.631 --> 02:22:03.511]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[02:22:21.312 --> 02:22:22.813]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:23.033 --> 02:22:24.214]  Willie Rodriguez is our guest.
[02:22:24.234 --> 02:22:28.196]  We have links to his website up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:22:29.396 --> 02:22:38.621]  We are carrying his incredible five-camera shoot presentation on what happened on 9-11 and what he went through up on InfoWars.com.
[02:22:38.641 --> 02:22:39.782]  You can also get it from his website.
[02:22:39.802 --> 02:22:41.543]  We'll tell you about that later.
[02:22:42.183 --> 02:22:45.305]  I do want to try to jam in a few of your calls before he leaves us in the next half hour.
[02:22:45.345 --> 02:22:46.245]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:51.104 --> 02:22:54.231]  William, so much is happening, so much is going on in the next segment.
[02:22:54.251 --> 02:23:02.067]  I'm going to play a few minutes of that clip where they misrepresent you continually and let you comment on that, but the point I raised before we hit the last break...
[02:23:02.941 --> 02:23:13.944]  To see how they expropriate the dead, expropriate the heroes, how they use the troops, how they use all of the courage of the American people, and people like yourself, and then totally ignore you.
[02:23:13.964 --> 02:23:27.387]  I mean, they gave you the big medals and awards and wanted you to run for Congress and had you at the White House, but you said, no, there were explosions, there were bombs, they'd offered you all this money, and you said, no, I'm going to tell the truth, because, again, you're that type of person.
[02:23:28.787 --> 02:23:32.248]  What is it like to see them continue to use the victims and the heroes?
[02:23:32.862 --> 02:23:33.403]  We're good to go.
[02:23:54.449 --> 02:23:54.949]  I think so.
[02:24:15.706 --> 02:24:24.116]  So, you see, this election, upcoming election, will be marred constantly by the 9-11 issue.
[02:24:24.496 --> 02:24:27.039]  On top of that, you have the first responders dying.
[02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:28.180]  Constantly.
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:31.481]  You have a hundred first responders that have died since 9-11.
[02:24:31.821 --> 02:24:33.961]  All the rescue dogs have died.
[02:24:34.361 --> 02:24:41.303]  You have close to 60,000 people sick because of the environmental effect, and they don't want to recognize that.
[02:24:41.663 --> 02:24:47.624]  Because, of course, it's going to be the biggest liability lawsuit ever presented to the city.
[02:24:48.024 --> 02:24:54.165]  So you have the mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, a billionaire who really doesn't care about the families.
[02:24:54.225 --> 02:24:56.546]  He's calling the shots of everything that is being built
[02:24:57.046 --> 02:24:57.527]  All right.
[02:25:07.501 --> 02:25:23.994]  And she has told you directly how her group has been in constant fight with the city of New York to try to get a respectful and dignified memorial to have the ash and remains of the people that died on 9-11 be placed on Ground Zero.
[02:25:24.074 --> 02:25:25.155]  And the city don't want to do that.
[02:25:25.175 --> 02:25:29.178]  They actually use the ash and remains to fill potholes.
[02:25:30.618 --> 02:25:44.868]  And when we are being used, politicized constantly by not only the city and the state, but also by the federal and the government in general for agendas that we don't agree with, we feel sick.
[02:25:45.048 --> 02:25:55.995]  We feel that we have to open our mouth and take an action constantly against these people that are actually putting out a whole story that doesn't agree with what we have been going through
[02:25:56.335 --> 02:25:56.675]  Well, I agree.
[02:26:17.951 --> 02:26:30.030]  We are here, but it's so convenient for them to use us for every single agenda to create this new police state all over the nation that it doesn't... I mean, it just makes you sick.
[02:26:31.039 --> 02:26:39.362]  Well, it makes me sick, and I can't imagine seeing people die and saving so many people and being in the middle of it, and being in your position, it must be unbearable.
[02:26:39.943 --> 02:26:44.444]  Have you seen that video clip of that mother who had the daughter named Langer?
[02:26:44.905 --> 02:26:51.627]  It's so powerful, it makes me cry when I see it, when she says, you know, George Bush used my daughter, he used her for his war, he used her picture.
[02:26:51.887 --> 02:26:57.510]  Well, I've taken it back, but I mean, the way she says it, you can just hear the strength, the anger.
[02:26:58.370 --> 02:26:58.630]  We have
[02:27:15.169 --> 02:27:18.731]  It's not only Cindy Sheehan opening her mouth out there.
[02:27:18.831 --> 02:27:24.714]  You have the mothers of 9-11 trying to get the real truth out to the nation and to the world.
[02:27:25.014 --> 02:27:26.375]  You have Sally Reginhardt.
[02:27:26.715 --> 02:27:27.495]  Sally Reginhardt... Stay there.
[02:27:27.535 --> 02:27:28.596]  We got a break, William.
[02:27:28.636 --> 02:27:28.996]  Stay there.
[02:27:29.016 --> 02:27:30.257]  We're going to come back and talk more about it.
[02:27:33.358 --> 02:27:34.279]  We're on the march.
[02:27:34.759 --> 02:27:36.380]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:39.962]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.413 --> 02:27:49.534]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:27:49.774 --> 02:27:51.515]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:27:51.795 --> 02:27:58.077]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:27:58.357 --> 02:28:04.499]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:28:04.739 --> 02:28:10.761]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[02:28:11.061 --> 02:28:17.467]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:28:17.607 --> 02:28:21.151]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:28:21.451 --> 02:28:25.154]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:28:25.354 --> 02:28:27.897]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:28:28.017 --> 02:28:29.078]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:29.358 --> 02:28:31.039]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[02:28:31.079 --> 02:28:33.620]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:35.501]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[02:28:35.561 --> 02:28:37.982]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[02:28:58.366 --> 02:29:01.048]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:29:01.068 --> 02:29:03.669]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:29:03.709 --> 02:29:06.271]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:29:23.507 --> 02:29:24.188]  It is liquid.
[02:29:24.528 --> 02:29:25.189]  It is private.
[02:29:25.549 --> 02:29:26.310]  It owes no one.
[02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:27.731]  It cannot go bankrupt.
[02:29:28.092 --> 02:29:29.973]  And it maintains its purchasing power.

[02:29:33.597 --> 02:29:34.057]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:29:43.149 --> 02:29:45.752]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[02:29:45.912 --> 02:29:52.039]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[02:29:52.199 --> 02:30:01.348]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[02:30:01.569 --> 02:30:02.450]  It's called Slender FX.

[02:31:21.978 --> 02:31:22.519]  I mean folks,
[02:31:23.440 --> 02:31:27.963]  I can't keep track of all the big 9-11 developments that are taking place and happening.
[02:31:28.603 --> 02:31:39.650]  I mean, I go to these different sites and I go look at the articles written by Marine Corps colonels, Air Force colonels, Army colonels, generals, all these new people.
[02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:41.791]  And I mean, they're not just saying, there's questions about 9-11.
[02:31:41.872 --> 02:31:45.514]  They're going, it's clear this is a blackout, run by the blah blah blah.
[02:31:46.314 --> 02:31:49.756]  I mean, I'm just like, and all these pilots and fighter pilots.
[02:31:49.796 --> 02:31:52.098]  I mean, it's just like hundreds of them.
[02:31:52.921 --> 02:31:55.423]  I mean, folks, the dam broken, I've gotten flooded by it.
[02:31:55.483 --> 02:32:03.449]  I can't even... I mean, I'm like in here, we got so many forces now, I don't even know how to interface with them or even know who's in the field against the New World Order.
[02:32:03.729 --> 02:32:05.831]  I mean, I'm telling you, don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:32:05.891 --> 02:32:21.222]  Make copies of DVDs, burn them, pass around video clips on the web, post all over message boards, go wild, letters to the editor, calling to talk radio, go nuts, protest, march, get involved, never just start talking in the middle of grocery stores, put bumper stickers on your cars,
[02:32:22.572 --> 02:32:32.644]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, ladies and gentlemen, and get the new film by William Rodriguez, What Really Happened on 9-11.
[02:32:32.804 --> 02:32:36.728]  It's $15, and it's over an hour long.
[02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:38.751]  It's a five-camera shoot.
[02:32:41.364 --> 02:32:46.330]  I saw the presentation live and everybody I talked to said this is the most powerful thing that's happened at this event.
[02:32:46.350 --> 02:32:47.211]  People were crying.
[02:32:48.292 --> 02:32:49.994]  It is a very well done piece.
[02:32:50.014 --> 02:32:57.063]  9-11 hero William Rodriguez has put out what really happened on 9-11.
[02:32:57.083 --> 02:32:58.725]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:58.765 --> 02:32:59.566]  Be safe and secure.
[02:33:00.066 --> 02:33:01.167]  We're good to go.
[02:33:18.023 --> 02:33:19.764]  Well, this is what really happened on 9-11.
[02:33:19.784 --> 02:33:43.578]  This was the presentation that we did for your symposium in California, and it was so powerful, like you said, where Charlie Sheen actually came over with Esai Morales, the famous actor from La Bamba, and they were so taken away because of not only the information, but the actual roller coaster.
[02:33:43.679 --> 02:33:46.060]  Their expression was, I went with you, Willie,
[02:33:46.414 --> 02:33:56.402]  Through the stairs, I got the anger, I got the laugh, I got the crying part, because I was experiencing the same emotions that you presented on that day.
[02:33:56.782 --> 02:34:14.216]  It's a very powerful documentary, not documentary, presentation, and the money that we are raising for selling the DVD is going to be to actually produce the European tour, the film from the European tour that we just did in the UK.
[02:34:15.096 --> 02:34:20.800]  And of course, this is part of what we are doing, trying to get the information out.
[02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:30.847]  And I just want to add that one of the activism that we have created, and I want you to be part of this activism, is that we are calling up volunteers
[02:34:31.471 --> 02:34:34.152]  All over the world that are listening to us right now.
[02:34:34.632 --> 02:34:35.232]  Volunteers.
[02:34:35.272 --> 02:34:38.433]  We need all kind of volunteers of any kind of experience.
[02:34:38.453 --> 02:34:39.833]  You have experience in Photoshop.
[02:34:39.873 --> 02:34:41.093]  You have experience in Premiere.
[02:34:41.354 --> 02:34:42.814]  You have experience in Final Cut Pro.
[02:34:43.274 --> 02:34:44.894]  Any kind of experience.
[02:34:45.215 --> 02:34:49.656]  So you can actually be part of this spreading of the information.
[02:34:49.976 --> 02:34:53.637]  And I already have like 900 volunteers from all over the world.
[02:34:54.097 --> 02:34:56.357]  So we want to expand at least to 10,000.
[02:34:56.657 --> 02:34:58.978]  So we can spread the information as fast as possible.
[02:35:00.276 --> 02:35:01.282]  Well, that's what's happening!
[02:35:02.199 --> 02:35:11.482]  In fact, there's a video I put together that's three and a half minutes long, that literally brought tears to my eyes last night, that was put together by some folks we're going to get on the show tomorrow.
[02:35:11.542 --> 02:35:12.803]  It's up on PrismHunter.com.
[02:35:13.163 --> 02:35:17.024]  That's how you can find the YouTube clip the best, and it is just so strong.
[02:35:17.925 --> 02:35:25.087]  And that's what's going to bring the New World Order down, is that there's all these activists, all these artists, all these people that really are our brothers and sisters.
[02:35:25.767 --> 02:35:29.769]  And, you know, I always have this subconscious feeling, or even a conscious feeling, but I never really think about it.
[02:35:29.809 --> 02:35:30.409]  I'm so busy.
[02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:48.716]  But I just last night, William, I thought about the fact of how blessed I am, even in all this adversity, and how honored I am and humbled I am to be involved in any way with all of these wonderful people in 9-11 Truth and then the heroes and people like yourself, William.
[02:35:48.736 --> 02:35:56.839]  I mean, you ever, despite all the evil and the sickeningness of it, on the other side, being part of this community, it really hit me last night
[02:35:57.419 --> 02:35:58.140]  Yes, I agree with you.
[02:36:17.863 --> 02:36:19.264]  You know, so much fakeness.
[02:36:19.304 --> 02:36:33.488]  People see me, for example, I get attacked constantly that I'm probably making a fortune by going around the world and speaking, and they don't even know that last year I only made less than $15,000 by going around the world and speaking.
[02:36:33.748 --> 02:36:34.768]  Less than $15,000.
[02:36:35.548 --> 02:36:41.230]  That's less than half of what I used to make as a janitor at the World Trade Center.
[02:36:43.339 --> 02:36:49.344]  But then it's okay for Giuliani, who all the firefighters hate, the police all hate him, the families literally 90% hate him.
[02:36:49.504 --> 02:36:51.126]  That's all over New York News nationally.
[02:36:51.186 --> 02:36:51.746]  They love him.
[02:36:52.027 --> 02:36:52.647]  He's a hero.
[02:36:52.947 --> 02:36:54.509]  He has made $100,000 for speaking engagement.
[02:36:54.529 --> 02:36:55.830]  $3.5 million for advance for his book.
[02:37:03.476 --> 02:37:04.137]  We're good to go.
[02:37:25.106 --> 02:37:26.807]  Put together, think about it.
[02:37:26.947 --> 02:37:28.207]  Well, that's how they operate, though.
[02:37:28.227 --> 02:37:44.932]  The very people that carried out the attacks, that are fat on the blood of our children and women and people that died in there, these pigs, and then we're literally trying to get funds to fight and move forward and do a better job, so we can, you know, keep up... We need the people to open their eyes, and that's why, Alex, I'm fighting back.
[02:37:45.032 --> 02:37:45.772]  I'm fighting back.
[02:37:45.832 --> 02:37:49.133]  I'm putting my gloves on, and I'm fighting back as much as I can.
[02:37:49.173 --> 02:37:51.834]  If somebody accuses me of something, I put them on.
[02:37:53.295 --> 02:37:58.718]  If I sue the President to sue somebody else that cannot validate what they're saying, I'll sue them as well.
[02:37:59.098 --> 02:38:01.039]  Because we need to fight back.
[02:38:01.279 --> 02:38:09.042]  We need to take these people, and as electrified they are, because they're totally electrified, they're like non-stop attacking us.
[02:38:09.222 --> 02:38:11.043]  We have to do the same thing back to them.
[02:38:11.483 --> 02:38:20.927]  I will be tomorrow, as a matter of fact, flying to Chicago, because on Saturday I will be doing a free presentation in Ann Arbor.
[02:38:21.611 --> 02:38:22.152]  I don't
[02:38:42.565 --> 02:38:49.528]  Well, it's not going to work, and everybody needs to get William Rodriguez's What Really Happened on 9-11 for $15 at InfoWars.com.
[02:38:49.548 --> 02:38:51.369]  And I will sign each one of them.
[02:38:52.229 --> 02:38:53.690]  I will sign each one of them.
[02:38:54.490 --> 02:38:54.930]  That's right.
[02:38:54.970 --> 02:39:00.312]  In fact, these are all signed that you've gotten to us, and it is, again, those are signed.
[02:39:00.352 --> 02:39:03.513]  We forgot to make that point.
[02:39:03.533 --> 02:39:04.954]  And William, also give them your website.
[02:39:05.894 --> 02:39:11.057]  It's 911keymaster.com or William911.com.
[02:39:11.197 --> 02:39:13.979]  It's the same website.
[02:39:14.399 --> 02:39:16.861]  William911.com.
[02:39:17.021 --> 02:39:25.326]  Now, before we play this audio clip and get your analysis of how they misrepresent you continually, I want to talk to Alex, Mark, Dan, Linda and a few others.
[02:39:26.266 --> 02:39:27.607]  How important is it for people
[02:39:28.832 --> 02:39:36.796]  To support Rosie O'Donnell, I mean, what she's got, and it's not about her personally even, even though we should support her and I appreciate what she's doing and admire her courage.
[02:39:37.177 --> 02:39:47.382]  If they're able, as you said, to set the precedent by demonizing her and by shutting her down, then it's going to scare others from going public and these murderers will be able to carry out more attacks.
[02:39:47.662 --> 02:39:56.227]  Go to PrisonBurner.com, go to InfoWars.com, go to the website we've put up and sign the petition and spread the word about that website.
[02:39:56.267 --> 02:39:56.487]  William?
[02:39:57.436 --> 02:39:58.956]  I agree with you 100%.
[02:39:59.056 --> 02:40:00.097]  We have to protect her.
[02:40:00.457 --> 02:40:03.158]  We have to come out and open our mouth.
[02:40:03.678 --> 02:40:05.138]  They are trying to demonize her.
[02:40:05.298 --> 02:40:06.558]  They are trying to criminalize her.
[02:40:06.899 --> 02:40:09.639]  We have to take a stand and say no more.
[02:40:10.039 --> 02:40:10.780]  We support her.
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:13.540]  We want her to speak freely.
[02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:17.281]  It's a matter of free speech even if you don't agree with her.
[02:40:18.022 --> 02:40:18.282]  You see?
[02:40:18.402 --> 02:40:21.042]  Even if you don't agree with her, we have to defend her.
[02:40:21.322 --> 02:40:22.183]  But I agree with her 100%.
[02:40:22.243 --> 02:40:22.423]  You see?
[02:40:24.372 --> 02:40:37.926]  I cannot comment too much because we're working things behind the whole media thing, but we'll wait for that.
[02:40:38.066 --> 02:40:42.210]  We are actually calling for people to support her as much as they can.
[02:40:42.851 --> 02:40:45.994]  And if they put a poll, flood the poll to support her, please.
[02:40:49.606 --> 02:40:51.368]  Oh, that was the other point I forgot to mention.
[02:40:51.388 --> 02:40:57.315]  There's an ABC poll running neck and neck with her and it's literally dead heat.
[02:40:58.376 --> 02:41:00.659]  We're talking nose margins on who's going to win this poll.
[02:41:00.919 --> 02:41:06.746]  If people agree with Rosie or they agree with O'Reilly the Demon, it's just unbelievable.
[02:41:07.972 --> 02:41:13.594]  Well, they have nowhere to go, and that's why they are fighting, because they see their status quo being changed.
[02:41:13.694 --> 02:41:17.715]  Well, are you hearing them more and more say, we need to be arrested, we need to be killed?
[02:41:17.735 --> 02:41:18.955]  They're not just saying that about Rosie.
[02:41:18.995 --> 02:41:21.196]  I mean, they're saying, we are Al-Qaeda, William.
[02:41:23.037 --> 02:41:24.297]  But you see, they don't face me.
[02:41:24.557 --> 02:41:25.738]  I want them to face me.
[02:41:25.818 --> 02:41:26.578]  They don't face me.
[02:41:26.598 --> 02:41:27.938]  They are afraid to put me on the show.
[02:41:29.119 --> 02:41:29.959]  I want to be on the show.
[02:41:29.979 --> 02:41:31.039]  I'm ready.
[02:41:31.439 --> 02:41:36.501]  Remember what happened last time, that they wanted to attack Charlie, and they called me, they sent a car to my house.
[02:41:37.338 --> 02:41:37.979]  To my house.
[02:41:38.459 --> 02:41:41.082]  And when I said no, I support Charlie, they took the car away.
[02:41:58.177 --> 02:42:03.040]  When they wanted me to go on Fox News on a tape show with Mancow, and I was really burnt out at the time.
[02:42:03.060 --> 02:42:05.902]  I was working all the time, still doing that, but I didn't want to fly.
[02:42:05.922 --> 02:42:09.484]  I'd just been to New York, and I'd gotten the flu while I was there.
[02:42:09.504 --> 02:42:11.465]  Thank God I didn't get sick until the flight back.
[02:42:11.905 --> 02:42:13.466]  I mean, that was like the worst flu I ever had.
[02:42:13.486 --> 02:42:15.487]  And I was just like, I don't want to go back to New York.
[02:42:15.507 --> 02:42:16.328]  I don't want to go back to New York.
[02:42:16.348 --> 02:42:17.228]  It's kind of like you've got a hangover.
[02:42:17.248 --> 02:42:18.389]  You don't want to drink that drink again.
[02:42:19.170 --> 02:42:19.990]  I think so, yes.
[02:42:37.370 --> 02:42:37.670]  You see?
[02:42:37.690 --> 02:42:38.251]  You see?
[02:42:38.271 --> 02:42:43.894]  And the thing is that also, if they ask me to be on a show, it's going to be a recorded show, and I always say no.
[02:42:44.294 --> 02:42:50.938]  If you want me, I want to be live, because I don't want to be edited because of the experience that you're actually going to play now.
[02:42:51.419 --> 02:42:56.722]  But the problem is that, you know, I want to be confronted with argumentation and debate
[02:42:57.242 --> 02:43:00.203]  With people that understand what I went through that day.
[02:43:00.483 --> 02:43:01.104]  I was there.
[02:43:01.124 --> 02:43:01.844]  They weren't.
[02:43:02.064 --> 02:43:03.605]  So they have no argument with me.
[02:43:03.945 --> 02:43:06.926]  And since I don't fit their format, they will take me out.
[02:43:07.166 --> 02:43:08.007]  They won't put me on.
[02:43:08.587 --> 02:43:09.007]  Absolutely.
[02:43:09.047 --> 02:43:10.928]  Let's play part of this clip and then go to some calls.
[02:43:11.468 --> 02:43:15.570]  Now tell folks, William, which particular TV show this is.
[02:43:15.610 --> 02:43:18.831]  This is the ABC News here in New York.
[02:43:19.051 --> 02:43:23.353]  And that was the profile that they did for the 9-11 Five Year Ceremony.
[02:43:26.558 --> 02:43:29.299]  Uh, presenting me as one of the big heroes of 9-11.
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:33.941]  But they're not letting, uh, what you had to say show up on the tape.
[02:43:34.201 --> 02:43:37.543]  They edited it to misrepresent that the plane caused the explosion.
[02:43:37.583 --> 02:43:38.043]  Here's the clip.
[02:43:38.083 --> 02:43:38.323]  Correct.
[02:43:38.743 --> 02:43:40.044]  He stays with you forever.
[02:43:40.064 --> 02:43:40.944]  He's imprinted.
[02:43:41.384 --> 02:43:43.105]  Rodriguez worked at the North Tower.
[02:43:43.325 --> 02:43:46.286]  He was a custodian responsible for cleaning the stairwell.
[02:43:46.686 --> 02:43:49.147]  On the morning of 9-11, he was in the basement.
[02:43:49.748 --> 02:43:50.548]  We hear, BOOM!
[02:43:51.431 --> 02:43:55.472]  An explosion so loud that pushed us upwards on the air.
[02:43:56.093 --> 02:43:57.273]  And we started screaming.
[02:43:57.293 --> 02:43:58.173]  We didn't know what it was.
[02:43:58.393 --> 02:44:00.954]  It was the first hijacked plane that hit the tower.
[02:44:01.174 --> 02:44:02.194]  We call it the Key of Hope.
[02:44:02.394 --> 02:44:05.155]  Rodriguez had one of only five master keys.
[02:44:05.395 --> 02:44:08.696]  Back that up about 20 seconds to where he says, it was an explosion.
[02:44:08.756 --> 02:44:09.777]  It pushed us upwards.
[02:44:09.817 --> 02:44:13.258]  And then he went on to say, we believe it was an explosion in the basement.
[02:44:13.798 --> 02:44:18.464]  No, they cut that and say it was the plane, as if he, the eyewitness, was saying that.
[02:44:18.844 --> 02:44:21.508]  William, what did you say at the point where they cut?
[02:44:22.088 --> 02:44:28.556]  I said, we didn't know what it was, and the first thing that came to my mind is that one of the generators blew up in the basement.
[02:44:28.877 --> 02:44:30.559]  It sounded like a bomb.
[02:44:31.241 --> 02:44:36.285]  And, uh, when I went to verbalize it, uh, we heard the impact of the plane all the way on the top.
[02:44:36.665 --> 02:44:39.547]  They caught all of that, and they put the plane on the top right away.
[02:44:39.607 --> 02:44:45.031]  Now, again, to be clear, then you saw people coming up out of the basement with their faces and hands and skin... Correct.
[02:44:45.231 --> 02:44:53.177]  ...hanging off like zombies, uh, you know, out of some, uh, you know, out of some horror movie, which, proving it was down there, we know there was a big explosion.
[02:44:53.437 --> 02:44:55.358]  So, see, and the firefighters and police say this, too.
[02:44:56.079 --> 02:44:57.400]  Again, play the editing.
[02:44:57.460 --> 02:44:58.981]  This is Big Brother, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:59.381 --> 02:45:01.643]  On the morning of 9-11, he was in the basement.
[02:45:02.483 --> 02:45:03.324]  We hear BOOM!
[02:45:04.144 --> 02:45:08.207]  An explosion so loud, that put us upwards on the air.
[02:45:08.827 --> 02:45:10.888]  And we started screaming, we didn't know what it was.
[02:45:11.128 --> 02:45:13.670]  It was the first hijacked plane that hit the tower.
[02:45:13.910 --> 02:45:14.931]  We call it the Key of Hope.
[02:45:15.111 --> 02:45:17.832]  Rodriguez had won of only five national teams.
[02:45:18.013 --> 02:45:20.174]  Ladies and gentlemen, realize what's happening now.
[02:45:20.314 --> 02:45:26.278]  ABC's own Rosie O'Donnell, with her top rated morning show, 30 million viewers, to O'Reilly's two and a half mil, okay?
[02:45:26.578 --> 02:45:28.299]  That's the numbers we're talking about, that's why they're so jealous.
[02:45:29.447 --> 02:45:46.436]  Now understand ladies and gentlemen, I can't get into it, William can't get into it, but Jones admitted on air, so I can talk about that, that Rosie's people told him that they have to get it approved.
[02:45:46.456 --> 02:45:47.316]  We'll just leave it at that.
[02:45:49.137 --> 02:45:50.898]  They're calling for censorship, it's already going on.
[02:45:51.852 --> 02:45:57.016]  They've got a big problem on their hands because if this chain reaction, which it's starting to do, it's over folks.
[02:45:57.036 --> 02:45:58.297]  9-11 is going to fall.
[02:45:58.637 --> 02:46:05.802]  Their main terror tactic that they use to set up the police state and the New World Order and the demonization of America worldwide, because that's what they're doing with all this.
[02:46:07.103 --> 02:46:08.644]  Domestically, we think they're the good guys.
[02:46:08.664 --> 02:46:10.005]  Internationally, everybody knows the truth.
[02:46:10.877 --> 02:46:12.858]  My God, William, this is incredible!
[02:46:12.898 --> 02:46:15.758]  We're on the edge of one of the greatest things in history.
[02:46:15.818 --> 02:46:17.159]  We can win this right now!
[02:46:17.179 --> 02:46:18.179]  Mm-hmm.
[02:46:18.459 --> 02:46:19.619]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[02:46:19.699 --> 02:46:21.420]  We are fighting back.
[02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:22.880]  We need to fight back.
[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:25.220]  Please, people, listen to the story.
[02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:31.782]  If you never heard my story, please, I talk about explosions in the building before the plane hit the tower.
[02:46:32.242 --> 02:46:43.628]  And after the plane hit the tower, as I went up the stairwells with the firemen following me, behind me, as I went up opening doors and saving people, I heard explosions as I went up as well.
[02:46:44.248 --> 02:46:45.589]  And they don't want to hear this.
[02:46:45.629 --> 02:46:46.809]  They don't want to talk about this.
[02:46:47.109 --> 02:46:58.375]  I had the opportunity, I wanted to have the chance to say hello to Professor Jones, but he had to go on the show, to actually have a presentation with him for the first time on stage
[02:46:58.796 --> 02:47:02.491]  With the father of depleted uranium, Dr. Doc Rocky.
[02:47:03.124 --> 02:47:06.546]  And all three of us shared the stage for the first time in Irvine, California.
[02:47:06.986 --> 02:47:10.508]  And I was blown away because of the data that they presented there.
[02:47:10.928 --> 02:47:11.908]  And these are the experts.
[02:47:11.968 --> 02:47:14.570]  And the only question that I had, listen, I was a janitor.
[02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:17.331]  I don't understand anything about the scientific process.
[02:47:18.031 --> 02:47:21.673]  All I want to know is that this information validates my story.
[02:47:22.133 --> 02:47:31.118]  And they came out at the same time I unison and said, not only it proves your story, but it proves that explosives were used on the towers on 9-11.
[02:47:33.144 --> 02:47:33.944]  Absolutely.
[02:47:34.505 --> 02:47:35.685]  It is so important, folks.
[02:47:35.885 --> 02:47:39.707]  Get the new video, What Really Happened on 9-11, by William Rodriguez.
[02:47:39.727 --> 02:47:45.989]  9-11 hero William Rodriguez tells his story in this powerful and emotional DVD produced by William Rodriguez himself.
[02:47:46.798 --> 02:47:55.804]  The 9-11 hero presents his incredible story of bravery and the subsequent horrors and accolades, excuse me, honors and accolades.
[02:47:56.124 --> 02:48:00.447]  He turned his back on in the search for the real truth of what happened that fateful day.
[02:48:00.467 --> 02:48:13.075]  I will be giving you, I will be giving you, last Sunday in Puerto Rico was a television special presented by Carmen Jovet, the top journalist over there.
[02:48:13.395 --> 02:48:15.016]  It has a show like 60 minutes.
[02:48:15.649 --> 02:48:17.230]  And it was seen by 3 million people.
[02:48:17.250 --> 02:48:18.771]  They are sending me the video.
[02:48:18.971 --> 02:48:21.533]  I will give you this video so you can post it.
[02:48:21.953 --> 02:48:26.556]  Where you can see, even though it's in Spanish, that they presented my story unedited!
[02:48:26.837 --> 02:48:33.901]  Well, that's the amazing thing is, folks, if you think the official story is imploding domestically, internationally, there's no going back.
[02:48:33.941 --> 02:48:34.702]  They've already lost.
[02:48:35.022 --> 02:48:35.783]  We are gonna win.
[02:48:35.803 --> 02:48:36.263]  9-11 proves the key.
[02:48:36.283 --> 02:48:36.523]  The key.
[02:48:36.543 --> 02:48:36.803]  The key.
[02:48:46.394 --> 02:48:46.834]  It's here!
[02:48:47.074 --> 02:48:51.817]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:52.197 --> 02:48:59.821]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:00.552 --> 02:49:07.596]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:07.996 --> 02:49:19.422]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:19.722 --> 02:49:23.244]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:23.705 --> 02:49:25.626]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:25.946 --> 02:49:29.808]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:53.263]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:53.683 --> 02:49:54.524]  So what do you do?
[02:49:54.844 --> 02:49:59.407]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:49:59.887 --> 02:50:02.009]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:50:50.348 --> 02:50:52.129]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[02:50:52.369 --> 02:50:57.811]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[02:50:58.011 --> 02:51:03.994]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[02:51:04.214 --> 02:51:06.636]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.

[02:52:27.332 --> 02:52:28.933]  Final segment, William Rodriguez.
[02:52:28.973 --> 02:52:30.234]  I know we've got a lot of phone lines here.
[02:52:30.254 --> 02:52:31.474]  Let's try to jam some of them in.
[02:52:31.935 --> 02:52:34.496]  Alex in British Columbia, you're on the air with William Rodriguez.
[02:52:34.516 --> 02:52:34.896]  Go ahead.
[02:52:35.196 --> 02:52:37.818]  Mr. Jones and Mr. Rodriguez, how's it going?
[02:52:39.499 --> 02:52:39.919]  Thank you.
[02:52:40.039 --> 02:52:40.720]  Thank you for calling.
[02:52:42.180 --> 02:52:44.702]  I just wanted to say I'm calling from Vancouver, British Columbia.
[02:52:45.542 --> 02:52:50.345]  And the ship, with a P, the ship is going to hit the fan this summer.
[02:52:51.266 --> 02:52:53.887]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:52:53.947 --> 02:52:54.768]  I appreciate your call.
[02:52:55.473 --> 02:52:57.314]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan.
[02:52:57.334 --> 02:52:58.274]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:52:58.354 --> 02:52:58.754]  Go ahead.
[02:52:58.774 --> 02:53:00.895]  Hey, how are you?
[02:53:01.155 --> 02:53:01.815]  Good, go ahead.
[02:53:02.576 --> 02:53:06.857]  I have a quick announcement that William mentioned earlier.
[02:53:06.877 --> 02:53:10.639]  There's going to be a 9-11 Truth event in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
[02:53:11.439 --> 02:53:17.681]  Yes, it's going to be in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the Michigan League at 9-11 North University.
[02:53:17.701 --> 02:53:18.122]  2 to 5 p.m.?
[02:53:18.142 --> 02:53:19.362]  2 to 5, that is correct.
[02:53:22.333 --> 02:53:23.313]  That is Saturday, yes.
[02:53:23.493 --> 02:53:24.734]  And there's 500 people.
[02:53:24.774 --> 02:53:26.474]  It's free.
[02:53:26.494 --> 02:53:26.774]  500-seater.
[02:53:26.794 --> 02:53:27.954]  Totally free.
[02:53:27.994 --> 02:53:29.595]  So bring as many people as you want.
[02:53:29.615 --> 02:53:33.695]  Yeah, man, well, I just, you know, I want to say, like, you've been a real inspiration to me.
[02:53:33.995 --> 02:53:37.296]  Alex, it's good to talk to you, and, um, yeah, keep it up, man.
[02:53:37.316 --> 02:53:38.216]  All right, take care.
[02:53:38.636 --> 02:53:38.977]  Thank you.
[02:53:39.037 --> 02:53:40.197]  I appreciate your call, David.
[02:53:40.217 --> 02:53:40.557]  Thank you.
[02:53:40.797 --> 02:53:41.657]  And that's important.
[02:53:41.877 --> 02:53:45.738]  Anybody that wants to put together an event, we will go over there and we'll speak.
[02:53:46.600 --> 02:53:57.248]  It has to be a big event, meaning at least 150 to 250 people or more to make it feasible to actually make the trip, but we will do it.
[02:53:57.529 --> 02:54:11.339]  If you can put it together, one of the ideas that we give to the activists is that we can do a faith tour, because we can go to churches that have probably a congregation of 200 people, and it makes it easier because you already have the venue.
[02:54:12.555 --> 02:54:14.515]  Linda, where are you calling us from today, Linda?
[02:54:14.736 --> 02:54:16.316]  I'm calling you from Chicago.
[02:54:16.636 --> 02:54:16.976]  Welcome.
[02:54:17.476 --> 02:54:17.916]  Thank you.
[02:54:18.056 --> 02:54:18.656]  It's an honor.
[02:54:18.996 --> 02:54:28.978]  I wanted to bring up a piece of the 9-1-1 puzzle that was exposed by Christopher Bolin, who's actually from Hoffman Estates in this area.
[02:54:30.059 --> 02:54:33.419]  He was beaten up about six months ago on his front lawn.
[02:54:33.899 --> 02:54:37.520]  He made some phone calls that day to the SEC and the U.S.
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:41.001]  Attorney's Office asking how this Jacob
[02:54:41.497 --> 02:54:49.770]  Also known as Kobe, Alexander was able to wire $60 million to his account in Israel and flee New York without anybody sapping him.
[02:54:50.345 --> 02:54:51.586]  Sure, I'm familiar with the case.
[02:54:51.626 --> 02:55:00.475]  Thank you for the information, but anyway, I'm just doubting a lot of the work that Christopher Bolin has done, because he even wrote an article attacking me.
[02:55:00.835 --> 02:55:04.639]  Yeah, you know, I mean, I'm not going to say, yeah, ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[02:55:05.039 --> 02:55:08.302]  You know, Willie's a good guy, all he does is help people, that's all I do.
[02:55:08.442 --> 02:55:14.007]  The things, the people he traffics with, and I've interviewed the guy, I've never been anything but nice, the things that have been said about me,
[02:55:15.268 --> 02:55:23.153]  I mean, if I open my mouth about these people and the information that I have against them, they will be totally destroyed.
[02:55:23.173 --> 02:55:24.573]  Their reputation will be on the floor.
[02:55:24.954 --> 02:55:26.234]  But I'm not that kind of guy.
[02:55:26.294 --> 02:55:27.275]  Yeah, we're not going to do it.
[02:55:27.375 --> 02:55:34.939]  I mean, no, the thing is that it's unbelievable the type of things that have been said about me for no reason.
[02:55:35.639 --> 02:55:40.502]  I mean, folks, the worst things you can say, and I did just sue somebody over something, but we fixed that.
[02:55:40.802 --> 02:55:42.163]  I've sued people three other times.
[02:55:43.070 --> 02:55:43.471]  I'm a go as a...
[02:56:02.220 --> 02:56:06.422]  Uh, viewer, on the court case, just to, uh... Yeah.
[02:56:06.603 --> 02:56:07.603]  ...listen if it's needed.
[02:56:07.663 --> 02:56:08.504]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:56:08.524 --> 02:56:09.284]  That's a side issue.
[02:56:09.304 --> 02:56:11.105]  I'm not gonna give the operatives any attention.
[02:56:11.125 --> 02:56:16.067]  The point is, uh, let's support Rosie O'Donnell with a petition online at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:56:16.388 --> 02:56:17.288]  Get over there, sign it.
[02:56:17.508 --> 02:56:18.749]  William, God bless you, my friend.
[02:56:19.249 --> 02:56:19.829]  God bless you.
