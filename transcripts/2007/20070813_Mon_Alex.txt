[00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:10.052]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:11.512]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:14.173]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.193 --> 00:00:17.613]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:22.094]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:47.103]  In the middle of last week we had New American writer and local TV host Bob Dacey in studio to talk about the two days he attended
[00:00:48.076 --> 00:01:05.281]  Where they were pushing for the North American Union and the funding mechanism, the NAFTA superhighways, and openly admitting that they were going to take over the existing roads and put toll roads on it, and how they were going to propagandize the public, and $700 billion offered by the foreign banks, literally to take control of the United States.
[00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.382]  We ran out of time in that one-hour discussion.
[00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:11.083]  He'll be with us again today in the third hour.
[00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:15.659]  It is the 13th day of August 2007.
[00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:19.621]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:21.562]  We're going to have open phones later in the show.
[00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:31.287]  You know, we have a members forum up on PrisonPlanet.tv with tens of thousands of posts and quite a few members.
[00:01:32.047 --> 00:01:37.510]  Frankly, it's members of PrisonPlanet.tv or anybody who's ever been a member of PrisonPlanet.tv is able to join.
[00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:41.511]  And then a lot of the people have been able to join by their friends adding them.
[00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:49.296]  We're not sure how that works, but we now have another forum for everybody at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:51.598]  Forum.PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:51.938 --> 00:01:54.379]  You can find a link to it at the top of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.360]  There's a link right to it.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.141]  Or at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:01.324]  There's a big fat link, a little green square right in the middle of the screen.
[00:02:02.044 --> 00:02:03.125]  You can link through there.
[00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:08.069]  I said I was going to do this yesterday, but I was just so jam-packed in the two hours I have on Sunday.
[00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.992]  I also had a debate with somebody I'll tell you about later if you missed it.
[00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:18.917]  One of these neocon types pushing this new martial law system, former JAG officer, head of the St.
[00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:22.840]  Mary's terrorism school down in San Antonio.
[00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:26.754]  I didn't get to any of it, but I am going to do it today.
[00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:34.544]  If you go to the forum, you will notice that the top link is questions for Alex live on the show.
[00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:38.109]  So you can post your questions or your comments there.
[00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:39.751]  Short is nice.
[00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:47.133]  It's better, and then I can read some of those on the air or answer some of your questions or read some of your statements on air.
[00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:55.855]  Live questions for Alex's live show forum, and that just went up last night and it's there and I will be taking some of those today.
[00:02:56.295 --> 00:03:08.898]  An alternative to being able to call in, because I know sometimes you can't get in when the phones are busy or not taking calls, but you can get a question into our guest or into myself or a brief statement via the forum.
[00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:24.629]  at http://forum.prisonplanet.com or again it's much easier simply go to prisonplanet.com or infowars.com and look for the link at the top to the forum right there.
[00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.311]  I haven't really yet plugged the forums.
[00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:28.733]  There they are now off to the races.
[00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:36.999]  Stocks trade higher after central banks add massive liquidity.
[00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.620]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.090]  Also Bush war advisor says draft work worth a look.
[00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:48.712]  Pentagon response today that was said on Friday by saying no no no there's no plan for a draft.
[00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:54.093]  Also over 1 million Iraqi deaths in 2003 it's not the 600,000 it's now a million and these are
[00:03:57.182 --> 00:03:58.243]  Independent U.S.
[00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:01.505]  and British-based organizations that are nonpartisan.
[00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:10.850]  Those are conservative numbers, so while we're talking about money and the price of our houses, people are in the middle of a globalist genocide operation.
[00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:15.593]  Hackers protest U.S.-Israel actions on the U.N.
[00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:16.234]  website.
[00:04:16.754 --> 00:04:17.714]  Iran says U.S.
[00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:18.975]  supports terrorists in Iraq.
[00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:20.996]  Well, that's a White House admission!
[00:04:23.078 --> 00:04:26.100]  I mean, that's admitted, but Iran says the U.S.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.640]  may be?
[00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:30.578]  Has Iran not actually read White House press releases?
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.961]  It's admitted.
[00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.664]  Karl Rove has stepped down.
[00:04:35.724 --> 00:04:36.244]  Who cares?
[00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:39.167]  Karl Rove never ran anything.
[00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:42.050]  That's all part of the theater, all part of the fiction.
[00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:43.172]  Okay?
[00:04:43.692 --> 00:04:45.394]  Now what does it mean that they've thrown him overboard?
[00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:49.018]  Large, fat, stinking,
[00:04:50.036 --> 00:04:58.094]  Know-it-all, little creamy-skinned, soft, disgusting maggot has left the Kazoo Marzoo.
[00:04:58.655 --> 00:04:59.197]  Be right back.
[00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:11.672]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:23.136]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:05:23.476 --> 00:05:28.518]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:28.838]  I think so.
[00:05:47.537 --> 00:05:49.158]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[00:05:49.218 --> 00:05:50.058]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:05:50.078 --> 00:05:50.418]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:50.478 --> 00:05:51.859]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:04.537 --> 00:06:07.721]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:10.003]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.364 --> 00:06:18.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:25.732]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:37.557]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:41.339]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.780]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.962]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:06:48.542 --> 00:07:00.485]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:04.286]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:09.667]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[00:07:09.987 --> 00:07:15.309]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:16.789]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:26.253]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:26.493 --> 00:07:28.114]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:07:28.334 --> 00:07:37.178]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:39.659]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.160]  Keep it natural.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:50.623]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[00:07:50.884 --> 00:07:54.885]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:56.366]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:08.748]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.368 --> 00:08:12.349]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.385 --> 00:08:30.888]  Alright, welcome back now into the second segment on this live 13th day of August 2007 edition.
[00:08:30.908 --> 00:08:44.616]  The websites are jonesreport.com, infowars.net, prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, not to mention arnoldexposed.com and marshalllaw911.info.
[00:08:45.237 --> 00:08:48.179]  And in the next month we're going to be launching a new website.
[00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:52.161]  It will be launched in September.
[00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.744]  We're going to keep that under wraps until that happens.
[00:08:54.764 --> 00:08:55.585]  We're also redesigning.
[00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:58.767]  This has been happening forever, but we did one redesign and we didn't like it.
[00:08:58.787 --> 00:09:04.192]  We're doing another fellow doing a redesign of InfoWars.com with a more, you know, Web 2.0 look instead of the Web Dinosaur look.
[00:09:04.733 --> 00:09:06.174]  But some people like the Web Dinosaur look.
[00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:07.655]  I mean, Drudge's Web Dinosaur look.
[00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:11.138]  It's the information that matters.
[00:09:11.158 --> 00:09:18.525]  We're back in the Plasticine era, or back in the Cretaceous, back in the ancient era.
[00:09:21.124 --> 00:09:38.446]  Okay, I got a lot of really important news here in front of me, but the Ron Paul camp said that they didn't trust the straw poll with the uncertified, decertified in California, in Florida, and many other states.
[00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:55.804]  The Uncertified, De-Certified, Die-Bold Machines, that are black boxes with wireless internet connections, run by a company that is well known to be military industrial complex control, that publicly brags that they work for the neocons and quote, will deliver elections to them.
[00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:59.586]  Where everywhere they're used, the exit polls say the opposite.
[00:10:00.346 --> 00:10:02.327]  We've never before seen numbers like this.
[00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:11.312]  I mean, you'll have Howard Dean winning by 10 points in straw polls and in exit polls in New Hampshire, and then he loses by 10 points.
[00:10:11.332 --> 00:10:18.316]  I mean, that's a 20 point difference in New Hampshire back during 2004 with the Democratic primaries.
[00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:21.698]  I mean, you see things in Iowa, in Ohio.
[00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:24.780]  You see situations in New Mexico.
[00:10:25.402 --> 00:10:29.934]  Where clearly the anti-war candidates, the anti-Bush candidates, win.
[00:10:31.438 --> 00:10:32.060]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.664]  They just say, hey, Diebold's counting.
[00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:34.186]  Doesn't matter.
[00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:35.395]  Doesn't matter.
[00:10:35.655 --> 00:10:38.517]  Doesn't matter if Diebold's been caught with convicted hacker felons.
[00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:41.239]  Felons running things as vice president.
[00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:45.201]  It doesn't matter if their own engineers quit and said they were hired to create machines for fraud.
[00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:55.507]  It doesn't matter if other companies' chief engineers testified before the legislatures that I was hired and told I was hired to create a fraud and steal elections.
[00:10:55.987 --> 00:11:01.891]  It's just kept real quiet and there's video shot by the statehouse and that's on the web and then Google deletes that video off.
[00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:06.431]  It's like they delete martial law when it gets 700,000 views in a week.
[00:11:07.011 --> 00:11:07.972]  And it's number one.
[00:11:08.692 --> 00:11:11.754]  So it doesn't get stuck up there at the top where millions will see it.
[00:11:12.834 --> 00:11:13.835]  This is how they roll.
[00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:22.419]  And still the general public can't believe that a government that will lie to you about everything else and run every type of scam you can imagine wouldn't steal elections.
[00:11:24.702 --> 00:11:27.503]  Sure enough, they had malfunctions all over the state.
[00:11:27.543 --> 00:11:32.326]  You know, Fox News reported that one machine that counted 1,500 votes had malfunctioned.
[00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:33.046]  Out of what?
[00:11:33.086 --> 00:11:35.287]  Only about less than 20,000 votes cast.
[00:11:36.448 --> 00:11:41.651]  Then it turned out other machines shut down and special technicians came in to fix things.
[00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:44.952]  And then magically, Mip Romney won.
[00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:49.595]  And then there was another level of spin here.
[00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:54.377]  Another level of manipulation.
[00:11:56.534 --> 00:12:00.478]  And that was that, oh, Giuliani wasn't in the poll.
[00:12:01.298 --> 00:12:02.800]  And McCain wasn't in the poll.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.462]  And Fred Thompson, they didn't compete.
[00:12:05.802 --> 00:12:06.663]  They didn't show up.
[00:12:08.104 --> 00:12:12.528]  Well, very few candidates ever show up to campaign this early in the key Iowa straw poll.
[00:12:12.988 --> 00:12:20.915]  But they were all listed, they were all competing, they've all been all over national television up to a million times, promoted and pushed, and on the cover of major magazines.
[00:12:21.035 --> 00:12:21.936]  Ron Paul hasn't.
[00:12:26.033 --> 00:12:30.535]  And so, to say that, oh, well, they were behind Ron Paul.
[00:12:31.195 --> 00:12:35.277]  It would place 9 and 8 and 7 behind Ron Paul.
[00:12:35.317 --> 00:12:36.437]  Ron Paul at number 5.
[00:12:36.938 --> 00:12:39.739]  Ron Paul got 9.5% of the votes.
[00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:40.859]  Almost 10% of the votes.
[00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:44.601]  The New York Times and others are saying, wow, this shows he's a first-tier contender.
[00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:46.862]  Wow, he got 5th place.
[00:12:46.922 --> 00:12:51.143]  That really does show he's, you know, see, that's spin on top of spin.
[00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:55.165]  I'll bet you my bottom dollar Ron Paul really won the Iowa Straw Poll.
[00:12:55.874 --> 00:13:02.000]  Just from what I've seen in the past and the Diebold machines and how all over the state there were thousands of Ron Paul supporters.
[00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:19.436]  I, Sunday night went and was looking and Saturday night was looking at the 10 or 15 Iowa TV stations and I was watching video clips there and reading local news reports and it was, they'd have a stadium with thousands of people and 80% of them would be Ron Paul supporters.
[00:13:19.496 --> 00:13:20.517]  It was just everywhere.
[00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:37.087]  And they were doing informal polling outside the straw polls, and people were saying, oh yeah, I'm going to vote for Ron Paul, but magically fifth place, with magical Diebold malfunctions, magically.
[00:13:37.847 --> 00:13:50.190]  And of course, if you look at elections, every time they malfunction, and then special technicians show up, and see, those are just the machines that they're having trouble wirelessly flipping, or having trouble with an algorithm stealing or hacking in.
[00:13:50.945 --> 00:14:00.068]  When you see the others are all being controlled, you only see them when there's a problem, and these special technicians show up and fix everything for everyone.
[00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:04.349]  And we literally now have hundreds of cases of this.
[00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:05.790]  Let me say it again.
[00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.170]  We have the engineers.
[00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.131]  We have them going public saying it's a fraud.
[00:14:09.571 --> 00:14:17.834]  And the other engineers who won't say it's a fraud, it turns out, are felons who spent hard jail time as top hackers!
[00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:19.585]  Running it!
[00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:22.187]  Running it with Schwarzenegger when he won.
[00:14:25.469 --> 00:14:34.415]  This is why you can have a 25% approval rating for Bush, you can still win, or a 12% for Congress, and these people can still win.
[00:14:36.817 --> 00:14:43.602]  We saw Michael McCall, who's married to the daughter of the owner of Clear Channel, who owns the voting machines that he voted on, and Travis
[00:14:45.535 --> 00:15:05.991]  Hayes and Williamson counties he was behind by what was it 15 points and then magically won by 14 that's that's 29 point difference from what polls and exit polls were showing that doesn't happen okay but he's involved in Homeland Security he was Janet Reno's personal lawyer and ran the Waco cover-up and the OKC op so
[00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.250]  He's in.
[00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.951]  Period.
[00:15:08.231 --> 00:15:08.811]  End of story.
[00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:09.931]  He's a black operator.
[00:15:10.352 --> 00:15:10.752]  Period.
[00:15:10.892 --> 00:15:11.792]  He rules, Austin.
[00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:12.733]  He rules.
[00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:14.653]  And it doesn't matter what you vote.
[00:15:14.833 --> 00:15:16.274]  It doesn't matter what you do.
[00:15:16.454 --> 00:15:17.034]  He rules!
[00:15:17.194 --> 00:15:22.917]  And there are massing cops, and machine guns, and armored vehicles, and helicopters, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:24.277]  And they got weapons!
[00:15:24.557 --> 00:15:25.598]  And that's all that matters.
[00:15:25.878 --> 00:15:26.838]  Shut up, scum!
[00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:28.179]  We rule!
[00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:29.039]  Period!
[00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:32.781]  That's their attitude.
[00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:49.218]  Coming up, I want to play 10 minutes of Ron Paul giving his speech at Iowa with the disgusting Loretta Ingram introducing him and making little sniveling neocon jokes as she tries everything she can to pacify conservatives and ensure the destruction of the republic takes place.
[00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:55.382]  My dad was driving to San Antonio this morning on business and he heard Neil Bortz.
[00:15:55.442 --> 00:15:56.463]  And folks, I don't listen to Neil.
[00:15:56.483 --> 00:15:58.684]  I mean, I might listen to him once a week, but I'm driving in the car.
[00:15:59.144 --> 00:16:00.865]  He's on twice a day on Kelby Jazz Station.
[00:16:00.905 --> 00:16:01.626]  I'm on here locally.
[00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:04.762]  And, uh, all he does is talk about me.
[00:16:04.802 --> 00:16:05.723]  It must be every day.
[00:16:05.743 --> 00:16:09.625]  He supposedly said, Everybody, I want you to watch Alex Jones' websites.
[00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:13.707]  I don't know what they are, but just type Alex Jones into a search engine.
[00:16:14.588 --> 00:16:16.969]  And I might have paraphrased all this, but he just heard it.
[00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:18.690]  So he says it's accurate.
[00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.331]  You can call in if you heard it.
[00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:27.275]  Uh, Alex Jones, I want you to watch his websites for when he announces that George Bush blew up the bridge.
[00:16:30.417 --> 00:16:31.097]  In Minnesota.
[00:16:32.563 --> 00:16:34.645]  Well, number one, we've said we don't know what happened.
[00:16:34.685 --> 00:16:37.267]  We know that it had construction going on.
[00:16:37.567 --> 00:16:39.169]  We know bridges collapse every week.
[00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:42.932]  I mean, what, three or four bridges collapsed last week, or overpasses.
[00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:50.938]  People reported hearing a blast, reported... I mean, I've got newscasts where they're saying it, but I don't go off that.
[00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:54.761]  It probably wasn't a government operation.
[00:16:55.462 --> 00:16:55.882]  Borts.
[00:16:56.863 --> 00:17:01.527]  But I'm starting to think, as I've heard it a few times, and callers have called me about it, and I've seen YouTube clips of it,
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.501]  People put the audio up on YouTube.
[00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:07.102]  But I think Bortz is a fan.
[00:17:08.203 --> 00:17:09.603]  And I'm not saying this sarcastically.
[00:17:10.204 --> 00:17:21.629]  There is a better than 60% chance that Bortz knows the truth, knows that the company's going to Hades in a handbasket, and actually is just plugging me.
[00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:24.731]  I mean, look, he's a very smart, successful lawyer.
[00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:26.832]  He's been in talk radio for 30-plus years.
[00:17:26.892 --> 00:17:28.933]  He's from Austin, by the way.
[00:17:28.973 --> 00:17:30.474]  He's from right outside Austin.
[00:17:30.514 --> 00:17:31.214]  He's from Bastrop.
[00:17:34.301 --> 00:17:37.482]  That's a suburb and beautiful area of the Piney Woods start.
[00:17:37.963 --> 00:17:40.404]  And, you know, Neil, I appreciate it.
[00:17:40.424 --> 00:17:41.384]  And I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:17:42.125 --> 00:17:46.286]  I really think that... I'm pretty sure of it, but I can't be completely sure.
[00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:48.647]  He's a pretty smart guy.
[00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:49.908]  He's savvy.
[00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:50.508]  Savvy.
[00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:54.230]  And... Thank you, sir.
[00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.931]  I mean, the guy plugs me every day.
[00:17:57.351 --> 00:17:58.512]  Go to my website.
[00:18:00.773 --> 00:18:02.954]  Go to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:18:06.557 --> 00:18:09.939]  So, look, I want Neil Bortz on this show.
[00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:17.923]  Let's call his people, Jones Broadcasting, and let's syndicate him.
[00:18:18.463 --> 00:18:19.903]  Call his offices in Atlanta.
[00:18:20.704 --> 00:18:22.165]  He broadcasts from there and Florida.
[00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.606]  It's like Limbaugh, he broadcasts all over the place.
[00:18:25.286 --> 00:18:26.427]  Out of his house, you name it.
[00:18:26.827 --> 00:18:27.667]  Get him on.
[00:18:28.247 --> 00:18:29.428]  Let's go ahead and get Neil on.
[00:18:31.229 --> 00:18:35.511]  When I met him, when he walked over, sort of cussing at me and teasing me and laughing,
[00:18:36.388 --> 00:18:43.870]  I don't think he was totally converted at that point, but I could see it in his eyes, he knew it was true, and I brought it to him in New York in 2004.
[00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.291]  He said, hey, I'll have you on the program.
[00:18:47.211 --> 00:18:48.551]  Save it for the program, Alex.
[00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:56.713]  So, I want to go on Neil's show, and then he can have me on his, and I'll have him on mine.
[00:18:58.794 --> 00:19:00.574]  I don't want to sit here and talk about myself all day.
[00:19:00.614 --> 00:19:03.555]  The point is, is that there is no way
[00:19:06.365 --> 00:19:14.368]  He is not so arrogant and haughty that he thinks it's hurting me to plug an attack.
[00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:20.070]  They have to know that it only helps.
[00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:29.474]  Now, they may be trying to inoculate conservatives who are now being converted to real conservatism and real liberty, real defense of the republic.
[00:19:30.034 --> 00:19:31.414]  Right when she needs it, boys!
[00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:32.615]  I mean, on the knees!
[00:19:34.033 --> 00:19:35.334]  This country is worse than on its knees.
[00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:36.675]  It's in a ditch, bleeding to death.
[00:19:37.535 --> 00:19:40.337]  And it's time for you to realize Laura Ingraham is an enemy of the Republic.
[00:19:41.338 --> 00:19:43.679]  And Michael Savage is a fake conservative enemy of the Republic.
[00:19:44.239 --> 00:19:45.760]  And Rush Limbaugh is an enemy of the Republic.
[00:19:47.682 --> 00:19:53.325]  And it's time for you, if you want to defend the Republic, and keep your Second Amendment, and keep your sovereignty, it's time for you to wake up!
[00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:56.167]  When wake up now, before it's too late.
[00:19:56.887 --> 00:19:57.548]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.568 --> 00:19:58.008]  Stay with me.
[00:20:01.841 --> 00:20:07.045]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:15.291]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:20:15.551 --> 00:20:22.596]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:20:22.756 --> 00:20:23.696]  We're good to go!
[00:20:49.964 --> 00:20:50.305]  We're good.
[00:21:01.657 --> 00:21:05.560]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:18.069]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:18.890]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:24.514]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.914 --> 00:21:27.116]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.977 --> 00:21:30.037]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:30.077 --> 00:21:32.918]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:33.038 --> 00:21:39.059]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.840]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:49.242]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:21:49.822 --> 00:21:53.829]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:53.949 --> 00:21:54.149]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.370]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:08.803]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[00:22:08.963 --> 00:22:11.464]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.

[00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:04.646]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:19.233]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion and establish a world government?
[00:23:19.853 --> 00:23:29.217]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:01.597 --> 00:24:09.345]  Look at your young men fighting.
[00:24:09.385 --> 00:24:11.608]  Look at your women crying.
[00:24:11.648 --> 00:24:13.930]  Look at your young men dying.
[00:24:18.604 --> 00:24:21.370]  Really, they've always done before.
[00:24:30.862 --> 00:24:31.883]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:24:31.923 --> 00:24:33.223]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:33.243 --> 00:24:38.106]  You're called for coming up the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:03.283 --> 00:25:06.466]  Coming up, I'm also going to play the Ron Holt, the Iowa Straw Poll fundraiser.
[00:25:07.507 --> 00:25:10.769]  All right, this is Dick Cheney, and everybody remembers this policy.
[00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:13.071]  It's not like they're stupid.
[00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:23.120]  George Bush said it, Brent Scowcroft, National Security, Brent, New World Order, Scowcroft said it, General Scowcroft, Kissinger at the time said it as an advisor.
[00:25:26.282 --> 00:25:28.444]  All of them said it.
[00:25:29.255 --> 00:25:31.356]  The Secretary of State, James Baker, said it.
[00:25:31.817 --> 00:25:32.977]  Why didn't Bush Sr.
[00:25:33.017 --> 00:25:33.998]  go into Baghdad?
[00:25:34.458 --> 00:25:35.959]  Why didn't they take it over?
[00:25:36.019 --> 00:25:38.361]  Why didn't they go all the way to Baghdad and get Saddam?
[00:25:40.282 --> 00:25:55.011]  And it was because the Pentagon and the war planners said, if we go in, it will cause continual civil war, and we probably, if we even tried, wouldn't be able to maintain order, and it would break into complete oblivion.
[00:25:55.911 --> 00:26:00.592]  Well, along come the neocons, and they say, yeah, we know about that policy, and guess what?
[00:26:00.632 --> 00:26:01.252]  We want that.
[00:26:01.412 --> 00:26:05.493]  And then, I told you before the war, we said it's going to break into three or four parts.
[00:26:05.913 --> 00:26:07.814]  They're going to have massive sectarian violence.
[00:26:07.914 --> 00:26:09.394]  I didn't think it'd be a million dead.
[00:26:10.014 --> 00:26:10.815]  That's the new numbers out.
[00:26:10.875 --> 00:26:12.275]  I didn't think it'd be that bad that fast.
[00:26:12.715 --> 00:26:17.916]  We knew they'd already killed two and a half mil before that, but that, you know, took them 14 years during the genocide op.
[00:26:18.876 --> 00:26:25.318]  And it was a slow genocide op of containment, but the decision was made because of destabilization in Saudi Arabia and other places,
[00:26:26.381 --> 00:26:40.151]  by Israel and other war planners that influence the Pentagon to go in, break it up in three parts, and create sectarian violence, and then export revolution into Iran and Syria with terror-backed groups controlled by the State Department and the CIA.
[00:26:41.151 --> 00:26:41.632]  Pentagon.
[00:26:42.552 --> 00:26:44.153]  And that's all public, by the way.
[00:26:44.974 --> 00:26:52.539]  They have the big announcements on the nightly news for the general public, then they have actual policy reports and statements and CFR reports that are public.
[00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:53.540]  And they said all this!
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:01.902]  That's what's so amazing, is they said, we're going to go in Iraq, break it in three parts, and then export civil war into Iran.
[00:27:01.922 --> 00:27:11.105]  And we're going to build permanent bases, and then not hold the rest of the country, and just let them kill each other, and totally debase the nation, and bring them down.
[00:27:11.505 --> 00:27:12.326]  That's the 1983 Israeli plan.
[00:27:14.694 --> 00:27:24.819]  All that's happened is the more old line conservative New World Order plan, the European type model of slow control and slow extermination has been replaced.
[00:27:25.159 --> 00:27:31.683]  One older eugenics policy, and that governs everything with these people, has been replaced with a hot war system.
[00:27:32.143 --> 00:27:35.124]  But here's Dick Cheney on C-SPAN.
[00:27:36.265 --> 00:27:42.508]  This is Dick Cheney in 1994 warning that an invasion of Iraq would lead to quagmire.
[00:27:43.982 --> 00:27:46.303]  Okay, and again, they knew exactly what it would do.
[00:27:46.343 --> 00:27:46.743]  Here it is.
[00:27:47.403 --> 00:27:48.523]  Do you think the U.S.
[00:27:48.963 --> 00:27:49.443]  or U.N.
[00:27:49.603 --> 00:27:51.304]  forces should have moved into Baghdad?
[00:27:51.604 --> 00:27:51.784]  No.
[00:27:52.224 --> 00:27:52.544]  Why not?
[00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:55.185]  Because if we'd gone to Baghdad, we would have been all alone.
[00:27:55.225 --> 00:27:56.405]  There wouldn't have been anybody else with us.
[00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:57.385]  It would have been a U.S.
[00:27:57.445 --> 00:27:58.385]  occupation of Iraq.
[00:27:58.445 --> 00:28:02.346]  None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq.
[00:28:03.627 --> 00:28:09.348]  Once you got to Iraq and took it over, and took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you going to put in its place?
[00:28:10.191 --> 00:28:16.475]  That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government in Iraq, you can easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off.
[00:28:16.936 --> 00:28:20.338]  Part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west.
[00:28:20.758 --> 00:28:24.601]  Part of eastern Iraq, the Iranians would like to claim, fought over for eight years.
[00:28:24.861 --> 00:28:32.046]  In the north, you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you've threatened the territorial integrity of Turkey.
[00:28:32.106 --> 00:28:34.708]  It's a quagmire, if you go that far and try to take over Iraq.
[00:28:34.788 --> 00:28:36.529]  The other thing was casualties.
[00:28:37.976 --> 00:28:43.318]  Everyone was impressed with the fact that we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had.
[00:28:43.939 --> 00:28:47.700]  But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:57.224]  And the question for the President, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad and took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth?
[00:28:57.704 --> 00:29:00.385]  And our judgment was not very many, and I think we got it right.
[00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:25.787]  Okay, so their CIA protégé, hired in 58, trained for two years in Cairo, known as a CIA operative, goes in, becomes head of Ba'athist security, they stage a coup in 79, puts Saddam in, funding 30 plus billion to attack Iran, then set him up, tell him, yeah, go ahead and invade Kuwait, we support you, we love you, April Gillespie,
[00:29:26.781 --> 00:29:27.601]  We're on the march.
[00:29:27.641 --> 00:29:28.502]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.653 --> 00:29:58.344]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.085 --> 00:30:03.806]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:30:03.966 --> 00:30:05.207]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:05.447 --> 00:30:08.289]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:08.649 --> 00:30:11.391]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:11.932 --> 00:30:18.676]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:48.420]  That's 877-873-9626.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.702]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[00:30:50.722 --> 00:30:52.243]  Look, up there in the sky, it's Non-X-Man.
[00:30:52.263 --> 00:30:52.864]  He's in a dive.
[00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:55.226]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[00:30:55.266 --> 00:30:55.886]  Let's go look.
[00:31:14.722 --> 00:31:17.904]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[00:31:18.325 --> 00:31:19.645]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[00:31:19.866 --> 00:31:20.346]  Take them out.
[00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:21.627]  Let's see.
[00:31:21.647 --> 00:31:26.210]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.050]  Don't worry.
[00:31:27.491 --> 00:31:29.012]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[00:31:29.632 --> 00:31:34.055]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[00:31:34.596 --> 00:31:36.657]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[00:31:36.777 --> 00:31:39.479]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.241]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[00:31:44.721 --> 00:31:48.203]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[00:31:48.723 --> 00:31:59.848]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:06.574]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:06.994 --> 00:32:11.217]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:11.658 --> 00:32:18.503]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:18.943 --> 00:32:25.646]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:25.966 --> 00:32:27.587]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:32:27.887 --> 00:32:31.068]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:31.328 --> 00:32:33.789]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:32:34.109 --> 00:32:40.832]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:41.272 --> 00:32:42.113]  Come, you masters of war!
[00:33:09.151 --> 00:33:11.051]  It'll build the big guns.
[00:33:13.512 --> 00:33:15.832]  It'll build the death planes.
[00:33:17.813 --> 00:33:19.693]  It'll build all the bombs.
[00:33:22.194 --> 00:33:24.574]  It'll hide behind walls.
[00:33:26.514 --> 00:33:28.335]  It'll hide behind desks.
[00:33:30.655 --> 00:33:34.676]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:42.709]  I want to play this Dick Cheney one more time.
[00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:50.274]  It's only a minute and a half long.
[00:33:50.354 --> 00:33:52.055]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:34:05.939 --> 00:34:12.342]  I need to get this clip and get it out to everybody out there, because here's Dick Cheney explaining what would happen in Iraq if they went in.
[00:34:12.843 --> 00:34:16.105]  Now, they knew this, and they decided, hey, this is a good plan.
[00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:27.911]  We'll go ahead and go in there and break it up, and then export violence, and then it'll be a nice little profit center with no-bid contracts.
[00:34:29.392 --> 00:34:37.475]  You talk about the age of corruption, it is now here upon us, and they just flap American flags in front of our faces, and go, oh, we're patriotic!
[00:34:37.856 --> 00:34:47.940]  While the corporations running this, 2A Corporation, are offshore multinationals, some of which have completely left and broken all ties with the United States, where they get no-bid contracts.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.203]  So here's Dick Cheney one more time.
[00:34:50.263 --> 00:34:51.745]  You need to email this clip.
[00:34:51.785 --> 00:34:57.173]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com, the page, to all your neocon buddies that are still not understanding.
[00:34:57.653 --> 00:35:01.118]  The government knew what was going to happen.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.801]  Here's Dick Cheney.
[00:35:04.306 --> 00:35:05.427]  Do you think the U.S.
[00:35:05.887 --> 00:35:06.347]  or U.N.
[00:35:06.507 --> 00:35:08.188]  forces should have moved into Baghdad?
[00:35:08.508 --> 00:35:08.668]  No.
[00:35:09.128 --> 00:35:09.428]  Why not?
[00:35:09.909 --> 00:35:12.090]  Because if we'd gone to Baghdad, we would have been all alone.
[00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.310]  There wouldn't have been anybody else with us.
[00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.291]  It would have been a U.S.
[00:35:14.351 --> 00:35:15.291]  occupation of Iraq.
[00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:19.233]  None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq.
[00:35:20.533 --> 00:35:26.256]  Once you got to Iraq and took it over, and took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you going to put in its place?
[00:35:27.085 --> 00:35:33.390]  That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government in Iraq, you can easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off.
[00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:37.252]  Part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west.
[00:35:37.653 --> 00:35:41.495]  Part of eastern Iraq, the Iranians would like to claim and fought over for eight years.
[00:35:41.755 --> 00:35:48.160]  In the north, you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you've threatened the territorial integrity of Turkey.
[00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:49.681]  It's a quagmire.
[00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.082]  It's not that far.
[00:35:51.542 --> 00:35:52.423]  It's a quagmire.
[00:35:53.003 --> 00:35:54.725]  You can watch the whole clip up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:35:56.599 --> 00:36:04.664]  Now, my question to the neocons out there listening is, what is it about propaganda and lies you don't understand?
[00:36:05.505 --> 00:36:07.046]  We have a military government now.
[00:36:08.287 --> 00:36:17.253]  And I had this Jeffrey Adukat on, who is the head of one of the preeminent new Homeland Security terror schools.
[00:36:17.873 --> 00:36:19.935]  It's an entire new school at St.
[00:36:19.975 --> 00:36:20.375]  Mary's.
[00:36:22.862 --> 00:36:24.983]  Prestigious School in San Antonio, Texas.
[00:36:25.063 --> 00:36:27.224]  And this guy was with Special Forces for 20 years.
[00:36:27.644 --> 00:36:30.205]  He was the main advisor to Special Forces for JAG.
[00:36:30.225 --> 00:36:35.827]  He's the guy saying, change the definition of torture to where we don't say it's torture.
[00:36:37.027 --> 00:36:42.670]  He tried to defend John Yoo and his torture statements about children until I played the clip on air and then he backed off of it.
[00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:44.610]  I debated him yesterday.
[00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.231]  We might even play some clips of that later.
[00:36:47.381 --> 00:36:54.025]  And I mopped the floor with him, but it didn't matter because Special Ops was there just to maintain the friendliness with the natives.
[00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:55.186]  That's all it was.
[00:36:55.226 --> 00:36:58.628]  He still knew that he would completely lose if he didn't at least take the debate.
[00:36:59.108 --> 00:37:08.014]  I debated him yesterday morning on CBS television in San Antonio and then I challenged him to a debate on my radio show and he concurred and went ahead and did it.
[00:37:09.554 --> 00:37:15.295]  But he said, well listen Alex, since 1933 we've been under martial law, we've been under war powers, and he knew it all.
[00:37:15.355 --> 00:37:18.516]  It was like debating with myself, but he was on the other side.
[00:37:18.976 --> 00:37:20.337]  He knew everything I knew and more.
[00:37:20.737 --> 00:37:22.977]  It was incredible, but he was saying it was okay.
[00:37:23.618 --> 00:37:25.718]  Just, oh well, we've been under martial law since 1933.
[00:37:25.958 --> 00:37:30.579]  Yeah, but they didn't build up the apparatchik to use it.
[00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:33.520]  And the public still thought they were free, and we still had liberty.
[00:37:34.167 --> 00:37:38.632]  They've been replacing it very slowly and now it's all coming to a head and there's nothing left.
[00:37:38.652 --> 00:37:44.238]  It's like termites eating out of a barn and now the barn's rotten and a wind comes by and it's going to fall over.
[00:37:45.239 --> 00:37:46.500]  You ever see an old barn do that?
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:53.528]  You blow up to it after it blows over in a wind and there's termites spilling out of it, out of its main beams that were put up a hundred years ago?
[00:37:53.548 --> 00:37:56.351]  I mean, that's what's happened.
[00:37:57.671 --> 00:38:01.935]  And he was going, yeah, Special Ops is doing all this stuff around the country and all these takeover drills.
[00:38:01.955 --> 00:38:02.736]  That's Black Ops.
[00:38:02.796 --> 00:38:04.037]  It's what Delta Force does.
[00:38:04.618 --> 00:38:05.619]  It's what the Marines do.
[00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:06.419]  And I'm like, no!
[00:38:08.882 --> 00:38:11.804]  The Marines shouldn't be training openly to take our guns.
[00:38:12.986 --> 00:38:17.930]  And I said, John Warner Defense Authorization Act says for domestic resistance against the American people.
[00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.152]  And he said, yeah, well, we've had that power since 33.
[00:38:20.212 --> 00:38:20.793]  He didn't deny it!
[00:38:24.813 --> 00:38:26.474]  It's not our military, folks!
[00:38:26.534 --> 00:38:28.895]  They've trained to kill us!
[00:38:29.195 --> 00:38:31.276]  They've been trained to attack us!
[00:38:31.857 --> 00:38:34.458]  And 20% of them in the Army now are illegal aliens.
[00:38:35.038 --> 00:38:40.241]  From Mexico and Latin America and some of them are from Eastern Europe and the Pacific Islands.
[00:38:41.322 --> 00:38:41.922]  Philippines.
[00:38:44.163 --> 00:38:45.143]  I've had enough of this.
[00:38:47.245 --> 00:38:50.666]  I mean, I had him on and I said, well now they've announced they don't need warrants to spy on the American people.
[00:38:50.826 --> 00:38:52.067]  He didn't deny that's what it was for.
[00:38:52.087 --> 00:38:52.867]  He goes, yeah, that's right.
[00:38:53.068 --> 00:38:53.808]  We can do that now.
[00:38:54.708 --> 00:38:55.608]  No, you can't!
[00:38:55.668 --> 00:38:59.810]  Just because you say you can, doesn't mean the Fourth Amendment's out the window.
[00:39:02.551 --> 00:39:05.952]  And you debate these people, and they don't even debate the facts with you anymore.
[00:39:05.972 --> 00:39:08.393]  They just go, yeah, uh-huh, we're allowed to do that, uh-huh, yeah, we're allowed to do that.
[00:39:13.295 --> 00:39:15.416]  Because Al-Qaeda hit us.
[00:39:16.756 --> 00:39:19.717]  And I brought up Operation Northwoods, and I go, do you know about government-sponsored terror?
[00:39:20.138 --> 00:39:21.518]  And he goes, I don't know anything about that.
[00:39:21.538 --> 00:39:22.799]  No, no, no, you can hear it in his voice.
[00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:23.779]  You know all about it.
[00:39:24.764 --> 00:39:26.725]  You know all about it, buddy boy.
[00:39:29.606 --> 00:39:31.967]  But see, the attitude is, well, we're tougher than the tough.
[00:39:32.007 --> 00:39:34.547]  We do the hard things to protect America.
[00:39:34.988 --> 00:39:36.368]  And you can't handle the truth.
[00:39:36.668 --> 00:39:38.369]  You can't deal with what we gotta do.
[00:39:38.649 --> 00:39:41.070]  You know, special forces!
[00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:47.212]  Hundreds of bomb attacks in Europe in the 70s and 80s to be blamed on communists.
[00:39:49.142 --> 00:39:51.703]  Well, the Communists do it, we gotta do it to blame it on them.
[00:39:52.163 --> 00:39:56.025]  Collateral damage, but if we don't win, the Commies will take over and kill even more people.
[00:39:56.665 --> 00:40:07.469]  Yeah, but what you don't know, Black Ops, is that our government and the British government literally funded Lenin right through Stalin, right through Khrushchev, right through to Gorbachev.
[00:40:08.649 --> 00:40:11.030]  Right through to Vladimir Putin today.
[00:40:13.131 --> 00:40:15.231]  And I can illustrate and document that till the cows come home.
[00:40:15.271 --> 00:40:16.672]  I mean, it is a sick joke.
[00:40:17.512 --> 00:40:18.912]  Here's a quick example, and I'll go to your calls.
[00:40:18.932 --> 00:40:22.033]  If you don't understand Iraq, maybe you'll understand Vietnam.
[00:40:22.474 --> 00:40:25.194]  I have interviewed the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about this.
[00:40:25.314 --> 00:40:26.415]  God bless him, he's dead now.
[00:40:26.755 --> 00:40:29.856]  Interviewed him five or six times on Vietnam, U.S.S.
[00:40:29.896 --> 00:40:31.616]  Liberty, nerve gas, you name it.
[00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:34.897]  Admiral Thomas Moore, died in 2004.
[00:40:35.697 --> 00:40:37.018]  Sharpest attack till the day he died.
[00:40:37.038 --> 00:40:38.138]  I interviewed him a few months before he died.
[00:40:38.798 --> 00:40:39.038]  Again.
[00:40:40.639 --> 00:40:41.319]  Then he up and died.
[00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:44.260]  But I was almost 90 years old, I think.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.400]  Well, 90 plus when he died.
[00:40:46.061 --> 00:40:46.961]  Anyways, I'm getting off subject.
[00:40:48.895 --> 00:40:56.858]  And I've interviewed many others who were, you know, colonels, special forces colonels from Vietnam.
[00:40:57.358 --> 00:41:03.200]  In 65, they could have taken the North and taken over the entire country in two weeks.
[00:41:04.781 --> 00:41:07.422]  By 67, it would have taken six weeks.
[00:41:08.906 --> 00:41:12.009]  They were never allowed to bomb the north or bomb the railways.
[00:41:12.029 --> 00:41:13.751]  They were never allowed to mine the harbor.
[00:41:14.072 --> 00:41:14.953]  They were never allowed.
[00:41:15.013 --> 00:41:16.835]  It was chosen as a nation.
[00:41:17.195 --> 00:41:26.725]  Ho Chi Minh was funded 987 million dollars, even up until 1962, while US forces were already there as advisors fighting.
[00:41:26.745 --> 00:41:29.127]  That's all mainstream, declassified now.
[00:41:30.429 --> 00:41:31.450]  Completely staged.
[00:41:32.654 --> 00:41:39.538]  The Russians were given tens of billions, right up until 1972, to bring in U.S.
[00:41:39.698 --> 00:41:46.902]  paid for, and in many cases built, weapons directly into the harbor to then fight our troops.
[00:41:48.282 --> 00:41:49.983]  Billions and billions a year.
[00:41:51.684 --> 00:41:54.886]  It was a perfect sliver of a country, perfect
[00:41:55.507 --> 00:42:06.950]  To suck up the youth, perfect to kill 58,000 Americans, over a million Vietnamese, to suck out the oil, and to, again, a perfect war to go on and on and on and on.
[00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:23.915]  And good old boys get to make, you know, 3 billion bucks dredging the harbor, and oh, another 20 billion a year on weapons, and another 60 billion dollar contract over 5 years for Bell Helicopters, and another on and on and on.
[00:42:24.635 --> 00:42:38.722]  I mean, they could have gone in there in two weeks and rolled in with mechanized forces and had Korean-type landings there and taken that place in a matter of days.
[00:42:39.282 --> 00:42:43.805]  But no, our criminal government had to first build them up.
[00:42:45.442 --> 00:43:06.376]  And build them up into a huge force, and then create an anti-war, CIA-controlled, hippie, yippie, feminist, beatnik movement, now all declassified, run completely by the CIA, to then create a counterculture movement in this nation, to break this country up.
[00:43:08.487 --> 00:43:09.867]  And what do you think Iraq's about?
[00:43:10.187 --> 00:43:11.288]  Demonize America.
[00:43:11.508 --> 00:43:14.189]  Make hundreds of billions a year and no bid weapons contracts.
[00:43:14.249 --> 00:43:17.289]  Already a billion, a trillion, one hundred billion spent in Iraq.
[00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:18.110]  That's official numbers.
[00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:19.650]  A trillion, one hundred billion.
[00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.971]  That's not counting expenses going out from here.
[00:43:23.791 --> 00:43:24.371]  Four years!
[00:43:27.072 --> 00:43:27.672]  A trillion!
[00:43:28.192 --> 00:43:29.333]  One hundred billion!
[00:43:30.453 --> 00:43:31.433]  Eight trillion in oil.
[00:43:31.493 --> 00:43:34.834]  And if you listen to an old show, don't email me and say, well wait, you said four trillion in 2003.
[00:43:35.054 --> 00:43:36.435]  Yeah, it's doubled.
[00:43:36.475 --> 00:43:37.295]  It's now worth eight trillion.
[00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:51.675]  You see, you've got all these reasons, but mainly it's about projecting power into the region, while at the same time the EU, running this whole op, gets to then blame us in the end, and then bring in UN forces later as the saviors.
[00:43:52.155 --> 00:43:55.897]  As they now announced last week, they are going to start bringing in UN forces.
[00:43:56.757 --> 00:44:08.762]  And Hillary's going to come in, and it's going to be, and you'll just kind of forget about Iraq, it'll be on the back burner, the CIA will stop staging terror attacks and funding as many groups, and you will see the insurgency die down, and it'll be called a victory by Hillary.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.181]  Now, you're going to have to watch all this happen!
[00:44:12.963 --> 00:44:14.264]  And you're still not going to figure it out.
[00:44:14.304 --> 00:44:20.909]  You're going to be supporting Hillary while this war goes on because you've got stickers all over your car, American flags.
[00:44:21.769 --> 00:44:25.972]  And you don't know that that just symbolizes the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, Declaration of Independence.
[00:44:26.193 --> 00:44:27.193]  That is America.
[00:44:27.413 --> 00:44:28.514]  That is the United States.
[00:44:29.135 --> 00:44:30.596]  No, it's all about feeling good!
[00:44:32.344 --> 00:44:35.406]  And I've read some of the letters and the psychology and watched interviews with these parents.
[00:44:35.787 --> 00:44:39.409]  Some of them like it their son died in a sick way.
[00:44:39.429 --> 00:44:42.232]  They like having the flag folded up on the wall.
[00:44:42.272 --> 00:44:46.835]  They like going to the VFW and people patting them on the back and your son died.
[00:44:47.035 --> 00:44:48.236]  You're sick, okay?
[00:44:49.097 --> 00:44:49.797]  You're sick!
[00:44:50.618 --> 00:44:51.498]  You're sick!
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.561]  You're sick!
[00:44:56.036 --> 00:44:58.999]  And your son died and you're never going to say this war was wrong.
[00:44:59.219 --> 00:45:00.880]  Because your son didn't die in vain.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.882]  Or your little girl didn't die in vain.
[00:45:03.322 --> 00:45:06.645]  Or your boy who got both his legs blown off, he didn't die in vain.
[00:45:11.269 --> 00:45:14.612]  And you're going to continue to support a war so more people can be free.
[00:45:14.652 --> 00:45:16.153]  Now that's a minority of the parents.
[00:45:16.453 --> 00:45:19.396]  Most of them have woke up and it's so sad and these well-meaning
[00:45:20.129 --> 00:45:30.111]  Men and women go over there to be fed into a line of fraud that's meant to kill this country and kill our name worldwide for the shut-up for the New World Order to now come into play.
[00:45:32.652 --> 00:45:33.692]  Do I like the Communists?
[00:45:33.712 --> 00:45:34.892]  Do I like Ho Chi Minh?
[00:45:35.292 --> 00:45:46.555]  No, they'd have gone in there in two weeks, blown the daylights out of those military bases, gone in, installed a Republican left, but they don't do good things like that.
[00:45:48.795 --> 00:45:49.835]  It's not a good government.
[00:45:51.656 --> 00:45:53.497]  You know, Endgame was done a few weeks ago.
[00:45:53.537 --> 00:45:54.857]  That is the raw Endgame.
[00:45:54.997 --> 00:45:56.638]  The most powerful film I've ever made.
[00:45:57.278 --> 00:46:00.099]  I've got to say, it's the most powerful patriot truth film ever made.
[00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:02.900]  I mean, it's so good, I can't believe I made it.
[00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:05.761]  I'm actually speechless.
[00:46:06.922 --> 00:46:09.083]  That's not hype, folks.
[00:46:09.363 --> 00:46:11.504]  It's the big enchilada.
[00:46:12.244 --> 00:46:13.784]  It is the apex of my work.
[00:46:13.945 --> 00:46:15.225]  I don't think I could ever top this.
[00:46:16.364 --> 00:46:18.547]  It is off the chart, whatever terms you want to use.
[00:46:19.147 --> 00:46:21.290]  It's unbelievably powerful.
[00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:23.612]  And it covers the very heart of the matter.
[00:46:23.952 --> 00:46:32.001]  But we had to stop the presses last night because we were just sweetening, finishing music, audio mixes, adding a few last minute graphics that came in.
[00:46:33.542 --> 00:46:35.024]  I've got to be completely done with it Friday.
[00:46:35.044 --> 00:46:38.708]  And I mail it off Monday for mass production.
[00:46:40.996 --> 00:46:45.520]  Got to author the DVD and approve it and got to finish the cover and write the back cover and a lot of other work.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.341]  Got to build a website for it and all the rest of it.
[00:46:49.743 --> 00:46:55.728]  We just don't have the personnel, that's why we need your support financially and we can do things better and quicker because I can make the film, but then I never promote it right.
[00:46:55.748 --> 00:46:58.850]  I don't have the apparatus to do that, but... How did I digress?
[00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:02.513]  Oh, we're doing research and... I knew Bush Sr.
[00:47:02.533 --> 00:47:04.655]  was involved in the one-child policy in China.
[00:47:06.337 --> 00:47:34.439]  And I knew he was involved in eugenics, and their whole family was, but then I discovered, just doing a little more research and some emails I got, that they ran this whole federal project with Kissinger domestically, and that they sterilized 42% of Native American women living on reservations, and that George Bush personally oversaw that, and that he was the guy that made the deal with the Chinese over IMF and World Bank and Lend-Lease loans, where they didn't have to pay for them, if they'd kill their people.
[00:47:36.169 --> 00:47:38.531]  If they'd sterilize, and abortion.
[00:47:40.192 --> 00:47:44.114]  And again, the rabbit hole on that just gets deeper and deeper.
[00:47:44.174 --> 00:47:47.276]  And so I said, stop the presses, and we added 20 seconds on the film.
[00:47:49.858 --> 00:47:53.040]  I mean, that's how much evil is in this film, how much evil is documented and covered.
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.802]  It's 20, 21 seconds of a two hour, 25 minute film.
[00:47:55.822 --> 00:47:58.584]  Just 20 seconds to 42% of Native women sterilized.
[00:48:05.026 --> 00:48:07.527]  And folks, they would come in to get dental work.
[00:48:07.587 --> 00:48:09.948]  They'd come in to have a baby.
[00:48:09.988 --> 00:48:14.309]  They'd come in to get a broken arm fixed.
[00:48:14.409 --> 00:48:15.630]  And they would shoot them up.
[00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:17.510]  I mean, every reservation.
[00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:19.271]  They would shoot them up.
[00:48:19.291 --> 00:48:20.091]  These are poor women.
[00:48:21.692 --> 00:48:24.612]  White doctors, predominantly, would shoot them up.
[00:48:25.233 --> 00:48:26.753]  These are, quote, liberals, by the way.
[00:48:27.093 --> 00:48:28.054]  Oh, we're helping you.
[00:48:28.454 --> 00:48:32.215]  They would knock them out, and boy, they'd go in and cut the uterus right out.
[00:48:33.357 --> 00:48:35.237]  They didn't do some tube tying, folks.
[00:48:35.938 --> 00:48:44.739]  They went in there and they made sure that that red woman, that Injun, they made sure she didn't ever have no children.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.080]  Folks, you talk about wicked.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:54.161]  I mean, this is the type of people we're... What do you think they're doing today to all of us?
[00:48:55.061 --> 00:49:00.863]  By the way, in the 60s, our sperm count was just, you know, healthy, 100%.
[00:49:03.095 --> 00:49:06.096]  The sperm count is now down, the newest numbers are out, by 89%.
[00:49:07.757 --> 00:49:10.218]  Continent wide in Europe and the U.S.
[00:49:10.598 --> 00:49:20.381]  You go to some third world country folks, or you go to some third world white population living on some little island, they've done tests in those places, it's 100%.
[00:49:21.302 --> 00:49:21.422]  It's 98%.
[00:49:21.782 --> 00:49:28.885]  I was actually looking at those studies just last week, and if you don't take hot baths, you'll be at about 100%.
[00:49:28.925 --> 00:49:32.226]  That damages them, really hot baths and things.
[00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:34.511]  But not here in the U.S., boy.
[00:49:35.611 --> 00:49:37.332]  Boy, can you imagine what they've put in us?
[00:49:37.713 --> 00:49:41.094]  They're going to work overtime on everybody.
[00:49:42.195 --> 00:49:43.796]  And there's a lot of racist whites.
[00:49:43.936 --> 00:49:47.137]  Most white liberals you meet, and even, quote, conservatives.
[00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:59.484]  Aaron Dykes was at a graduation party for college for one of his family members, and his brother
[00:50:00.402 --> 00:50:03.643]  We saw some old friends from high school, and these are people with degrees, and you know.
[00:50:05.983 --> 00:50:07.784]  And they're like, oh, that's good, yeah.
[00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:11.765]  I mean, most people you talk to, I've run into a lot of people I know, they're like, well, shouldn't we do that?
[00:50:12.165 --> 00:50:13.645]  See, they don't know why they think that.
[00:50:13.665 --> 00:50:15.526]  They were just conditioned, that's what you do.
[00:50:17.406 --> 00:50:18.766]  This is the driving force.
[00:50:21.027 --> 00:50:22.747]  And they're going to work on us.
[00:50:22.967 --> 00:50:26.628]  I mean, anybody who takes any vaccines is insane.
[00:50:27.929 --> 00:50:29.669]  You are off your rocker.
[00:50:32.679 --> 00:50:36.701]  You are so crazy, I don't even know what to say to you.
[00:50:37.741 --> 00:50:47.546]  I mean, you've got a government that's been double time killing us and sterilizing us, and you're going to trust them to shoot you up.
[00:50:51.508 --> 00:50:53.529]  These people can't be trusted to wipe their own noses.
[00:50:53.549 --> 00:51:00.272]  We're going to go to your calls, Jim, Joe, David, Nelson, Kyle, and others on the other side.
[00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:10.345]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.725 --> 00:51:18.370]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.068 --> 00:51:26.111]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.511 --> 00:51:37.956]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.256 --> 00:51:41.757]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.217 --> 00:51:44.158]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.478 --> 00:51:48.320]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:09.892]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume, the water we drink, and the OTCs and prescription medications we take?
[00:53:10.173 --> 00:53:16.362]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[00:53:16.642 --> 00:53:24.349]  The fact is, the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body, from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.
[00:53:24.609 --> 00:53:34.858]  So why not give your liver the help it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula, prescribed by more than 200,000 doctors in over 76 countries.

[00:54:08.939 --> 00:54:16.381]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls, but I've got a... We have the maiden voyage here of, uh, the PrisonPlanet.com public forum.
[00:54:16.461 --> 00:54:19.181]  There's also a private forum for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:23.062 --> 00:54:25.003]  So many questions here, since I mentioned it.
[00:54:25.023 --> 00:54:28.184]  There's like a hundred questions.
[00:54:29.724 --> 00:54:32.025]  Ron Paul-Cynthia McKinney split ticket.
[00:54:32.545 --> 00:54:33.645]  Would that be a good idea?
[00:54:34.782 --> 00:54:35.643]  I don't think it would be.
[00:54:36.043 --> 00:54:42.427]  I like Cynthia McKinney on her bold stance on 9-11 being an inside job, and on the U.N.
[00:54:42.847 --> 00:54:46.650]  Dying Corps Halliburton child kidnapping rings, and Trillian's missing from the Pentagon.
[00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:47.330]  She's a great lady.
[00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.850]  I like her.
[00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:49.852]  I've met her a few times, friends with her.
[00:54:50.952 --> 00:54:54.034]  But I just think Ron Paul is in a different league.
[00:54:55.095 --> 00:54:57.757]  I mean, she is still a little anti-gun.
[00:54:58.197 --> 00:55:01.339]  She still hadn't completely figured out the New World Order, though she's coming along.
[00:55:02.484 --> 00:55:04.966]  And, uh, Ron Paul's a perfect thoroughbred candidate.
[00:55:05.226 --> 00:55:13.213]  He's a constitutionalist, libertarian, perfect voting record, and she's got a pretty bad one on a bunch of subjects, so you can't mix blood with oil.
[00:55:14.374 --> 00:55:19.618]  And, uh, as much as I like Cynthia McKinney, and I would support her in Georgia against any candidate she ran against, she's great.
[00:55:20.438 --> 00:55:22.400]  For courage, and at least she means well.
[00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:28.552]  She's silly and ignorant in some respects, but she's got guts, and guts is enough, as they say.
[00:55:28.613 --> 00:55:34.875]  But when you talk about Ron Paul, it's just a different league, different animal altogether.
[00:55:36.096 --> 00:55:40.798]  And so, no, that's an absolutely horrible idea, in my opinion.
[00:55:41.258 --> 00:55:42.619]  But you know what they say about opinions.
[00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:45.420]  I mean, you can't take something that good.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.801]  I mean, Ron Paul really is a jewel.
[00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:50.351]  Certainly McKinney's a darling.
[00:55:50.451 --> 00:55:52.833]  It's just, it's two different planets, folks.
[00:55:54.814 --> 00:55:58.837]  Also, questions about free energy.
[00:55:58.857 --> 00:55:59.617]  Can it be free?
[00:55:59.737 --> 00:56:05.902]  There are a lot of really good alternative fuel systems and new developed technologies that have been suppressed.
[00:56:05.922 --> 00:56:07.103]  There's also a lot of quackery.
[00:56:07.523 --> 00:56:10.505]  For anything real that's going on, you're going to have a lot of baloney artists.
[00:56:10.525 --> 00:56:11.786]  So you've got to be careful there.
[00:56:12.907 --> 00:56:14.948]  JFK assassination of the limo driver.
[00:56:15.248 --> 00:56:17.610]  The JFK experts I've talked to, Colonel Roberts,
[00:56:18.779 --> 00:56:32.524]  Uh, Jim Mars, many others say that no, that he's turning around, that he's not blowing his head off in the car, there were too many witnesses right around it, too many snapshots taken, uh, and you see stuff on the internet where you've got like pixelation and things, that is not the case.
[00:56:33.164 --> 00:56:35.905]  I know Bill Cooper said it was, I respectfully think he was wrong.
[00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.346]  But, again, what do I know?
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.922]  How did Americans allow themselves to be licensed to death?
[00:56:40.982 --> 00:56:41.943]  It was done incrementally.
[00:56:42.343 --> 00:56:45.386]  Like, oh, you do get your tax exemption, Church, 1951.
[00:56:45.866 --> 00:56:46.887]  We're starting this new policy.
[00:56:46.927 --> 00:56:48.108]  Just sign this form, though.
[00:56:48.128 --> 00:56:48.909]  It's a formality.
[00:56:49.209 --> 00:56:50.650]  And then, now you gotta sign it.
[00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:52.171]  Now you can't have any free speech.
[00:56:52.231 --> 00:56:53.032]  Now we control you!
[00:56:53.432 --> 00:56:59.077]  And then people said, well, what about Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof?
[00:56:59.117 --> 00:57:06.002]  It's like, oh, we want to have licenses for these trucks ruining the roads you pay for in the 1920s.
[00:57:07.702 --> 00:57:09.382]  These greedy trucks are making money!
[00:57:10.803 --> 00:57:15.844]  So they got the underclass to go after the quote middle class and start taxing the truck drivers and then the 30s come along.
[00:57:15.864 --> 00:57:17.725]  Well how about a license for people under 20?
[00:57:18.365 --> 00:57:19.985]  How about an ID car without your picture?
[00:57:20.445 --> 00:57:22.466]  Now it's a privilege to move and travel.
[00:57:22.706 --> 00:57:25.467]  It isn't, Supreme Court said it isn't, but cops have been told that.
[00:57:25.827 --> 00:57:30.568]  They think it's a privilege to have a church, they think it's a privilege to protest now, they think it's a privilege to have a gun.
[00:57:31.008 --> 00:57:32.569]  It isn't, but they've been told.
[00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:34.069]  It's incrementalism.
[00:57:37.503 --> 00:57:40.646]  It goes on, open borders when a terrorist attack is imminent.
[00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:42.647]  Let me click on this one and get more specifics.
[00:57:44.028 --> 00:57:46.510]  Will the new old order be able to have its cake and eat it too?
[00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:50.374]  They sell fear and terrorism as our borders remain open.
[00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:58.020]  Would you leave your back door open if a killer is running around in your town?
[00:58:00.157 --> 00:58:09.919]  Well, that's like if the police show up to a bank and there's no forced entry at night and they come in and the safe door's open and nobody's nitroed it or dynamited it.
[00:58:09.939 --> 00:58:11.479]  They're gonna go, this is an inside job.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:13.520]  Of course.
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:20.841]  If they nuke Chicago or something like that, there'll be a lot of squealing and yelling and the media just won't allow that to be said.
[00:58:21.501 --> 00:58:23.242]  But yet, the grassroots will all know.
[00:58:24.422 --> 00:58:25.562]  The grassroots will all know.
[00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:29.723]  But I mean, I think the neocons have really gone crazy at a certain level.
[00:58:30.063 --> 00:58:35.828]  I mean, they're on Fox News saying, yeah, you know, this calmness is right.
[00:58:35.868 --> 00:58:37.089]  We need another attack.
[00:58:37.729 --> 00:58:39.911]  I mean, it's getting real obvious who stands to gain now.
[00:58:42.052 --> 00:58:46.275]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.308 --> 00:59:02.489]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:03.129 --> 00:59:03.970]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:05.630]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:09.951]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.472 --> 00:59:14.593]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.873 --> 00:59:18.794]  We are now into our number two.
[00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:24.856]  We've got a video of Ron Paul at the Straw Poll over the weekend giving a speech.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.581]  Top seismologist.
[00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:29.283]  Southern California due for a major quake.
[00:59:29.823 --> 00:59:31.164]  We're playing some audio from that.
[00:59:31.544 --> 00:59:33.086]  Dick Cheney back in 94.
[00:59:33.126 --> 00:59:34.087]  We have a C-SPAN clip.
[00:59:34.347 --> 00:59:35.768]  We're going to talk more about it with the callers.
[00:59:36.268 --> 00:59:38.150]  Saying, hey, going into Iraq would be a quagmire.
[00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.971]  Break into three parts.
[00:59:38.991 --> 00:59:39.751]  We don't want that.
[00:59:40.732 --> 00:59:41.913]  Stocks trade higher.
[00:59:41.933 --> 00:59:43.274]  Central banks add liquidity.
[00:59:43.334 --> 00:59:46.337]  What does that mean long term, even short term?
[00:59:46.397 --> 00:59:48.599]  Bush war advisor says draft worth a look.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.981]  Over a million dead Iraqis since 2003.
[00:59:53.604 --> 00:59:57.387]  We're going to go over all of that today, but let's get through a bunch of your calls right now.
[00:59:57.547 --> 00:59:58.988]  Jim, in Illinois.
[00:59:59.008 --> 01:00:00.329]  Thanks for holding her on the air, Jim.
[01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.072]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:03.832]  Good, Jim.
[01:00:03.872 --> 01:00:04.192]  Welcome.
[01:00:05.113 --> 01:00:05.574]  Thank you.
[01:00:06.034 --> 01:00:07.355]  You've been talking policy.
[01:00:07.795 --> 01:00:09.957]  Policy is all about control.
[01:00:11.178 --> 01:00:13.080]  Gun controls and everything else.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.303]  Doctors want you to line up to take those wonderful shots that they have.
[01:00:17.663 --> 01:00:21.006]  I've got some statistics here you'd be really interested in for our listeners.
[01:00:21.644 --> 01:00:24.386]  There are approximately 700,000 physicians in the United States.
[01:00:24.426 --> 01:00:28.348]  There are approximately 120,000 accidental deaths caused by physicians each year.
[01:00:28.368 --> 01:00:29.269]  The U.S.
[01:00:29.289 --> 01:00:35.453]  Department of Health reports that accidental deaths per physician is 0.171 per doctor.
[01:00:35.993 --> 01:00:36.593]  Big numbers.
[01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:40.876]  There are approximately 80 million gun owners in the U.S.
[01:00:41.296 --> 01:00:45.459]  The number of accidental gun deaths per owner, all age groups, is 0.0000188.
[01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:54.914]  Statistically, doctors are approximately 9,000 times more dangerous than gun owners.
[01:00:55.374 --> 01:00:57.776]  Not everyone has a gun, but everyone has at least one doctor.
[01:00:58.316 --> 01:01:00.998]  We need to alert everyone to this alarming threat.
[01:01:01.419 --> 01:01:04.841]  We must ban doctors before this accidental death rate goes out of hand.
[01:01:06.803 --> 01:01:10.205]  Well, those are real numbers, and it's not just doctors.
[01:01:10.365 --> 01:01:14.769]  I mean, people are going to die, they're going to be sick, but there is a lot of malpractice that goes on.
[01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:16.270]  There's a lot of really dangerous drugs.
[01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:18.952]  They put people on far too many of these drugs.
[01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:21.299]  And those numbers that you read are accurate.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.822]  Those are the Fed's own numbers.
[01:01:22.842 --> 01:01:25.505]  They don't like to publicize those.
[01:01:25.565 --> 01:01:27.328]  In fact, I've seen numbers that are even far worse.
[01:01:28.112 --> 01:01:31.195]  I mean, more people drown each year, what is it, on average about ten times.
[01:01:31.695 --> 01:01:34.377]  More people are electrocuted, but they don't hype it up.
[01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:45.747]  It's because, and we all know this, we've got to educate the general public that that's why there's a full-tilt, boogie, demonization of guns, because they want our guns to have their way with us.
[01:01:45.787 --> 01:01:48.148]  That's the one reason they haven't bloated the economy entirely.
[01:01:48.469 --> 01:01:55.975]  It's the one reason they haven't brought in a complete tyranny, is they know that they've done their computer modeling and their tests, and they know people are going to go ahead and fight back.
[01:01:56.650 --> 01:02:03.396]  If 1% fight back of the 150 million gun owners in this country, that is 1,500,000 combatants.
[01:02:04.697 --> 01:02:08.800]  Yeah, they are so full of garbage in this town we live out here in Rockford.
[01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:17.848]  The local selected chief that was put in there for the police, he said that we don't have a problem.
[01:02:18.208 --> 01:02:19.029]  Everything's fine.
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.562]  As far as gun control, we don't need any more cops.
[01:02:23.082 --> 01:02:29.086]  Our mayor goes into Chicago and gives, I think it was to the Trib, an interview saying that there's nothing we can do.
[01:02:29.166 --> 01:02:31.268]  Children are running around on our streets with guns.
[01:02:31.688 --> 01:02:33.689]  Now, Chicago is a no-gun town.
[01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:35.391]  Well, that's because it's run by the Mafia.
[01:02:35.431 --> 01:02:37.112]  It's been run by the Mafia for a hundred years.
[01:02:37.152 --> 01:02:40.154]  Do you think the Mafia wants their slaves with guns?
[01:02:40.734 --> 01:02:43.116]  There is many, many ties between Rockford
[01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:51.754]  And Chicago, as far as Mafia, it's in one of the local newspapers, a private paper, quite often, probably a dozen articles a year at least.
[01:02:51.774 --> 01:02:53.074]  No, I mean, I'm not knocking Illinois.
[01:02:53.114 --> 01:02:54.055]  Great people, great folks.
[01:02:54.095 --> 01:02:54.875]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:55.215 --> 01:02:56.236]  But I mean, I studied the history.
[01:02:56.256 --> 01:02:57.076]  I read books on it.
[01:02:57.096 --> 01:02:58.577]  It's on mainstream television.
[01:02:59.257 --> 01:03:05.560]  Illinois is probably, as a state itself, more corrupt than even New York.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.441]  And the city of Chicago, there is no doubt, is more corrupt than New York.
[01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:10.522]  New York, of course, is number two.
[01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:12.830]  And it's openly mafia run.
[01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:15.973]  Now, I mean, do you think the mob wants the slaves?
[01:03:16.073 --> 01:03:20.176]  I mean, the cops in Chicago for 80, 90 years openly shake people down.
[01:03:20.236 --> 01:03:21.657]  I mean, I know a lot of people live in Chicago.
[01:03:22.277 --> 01:03:23.398]  And they'll just come up and say, give me money.
[01:03:24.039 --> 01:03:25.760]  That's why there's all these videos of cops in bars.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.761]  They'll just decide to beat a woman up.
[01:03:28.342 --> 01:03:29.463]  They'll just climb behind the counter.
[01:03:29.483 --> 01:03:33.586]  If they don't give her a big enough shot of tequila and beat her for a few hours, nothing happens.
[01:03:33.606 --> 01:03:35.347]  I mean, it's just how they operate.
[01:03:35.367 --> 01:03:36.368]  It's just, I'm God, man.
[01:03:36.728 --> 01:03:37.829]  I'm the mob in a uniform.
[01:03:38.712 --> 01:03:39.413]  I got a weapon?
[01:03:39.873 --> 01:03:41.115]  Get down there and lick my boots!
[01:03:42.216 --> 01:03:44.138]  The Daily Crime Family runs this city!
[01:03:44.699 --> 01:03:46.020]  Now you give me your gun right now!
[01:03:54.002 --> 01:03:54.742]  Terrorism!
[01:03:54.923 --> 01:03:55.663]  Terrorism!
[01:03:55.783 --> 01:04:01.826]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:03.707]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:04:03.947 --> 01:04:06.428]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:04:06.808 --> 01:04:21.376]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:21.416 --> 01:04:21.716]  government.
[01:04:21.896 --> 01:04:23.717]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:29.999]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.621]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:04:57.368 --> 01:05:02.114]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.495 --> 01:05:10.145]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.842 --> 01:05:17.885]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.285 --> 01:05:29.710]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:33.532]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.992 --> 01:05:35.933]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.253 --> 01:05:40.095]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:08.754]  Okay, let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:07:09.215 --> 01:07:12.717]  Joe, David, Kyle, Mike, Wes, we're going to get to all of you.
[01:07:14.538 --> 01:07:21.383]  Zed is calling in from one of the fastest growing countries and sectors in the world.
[01:07:22.644 --> 01:07:25.326]  In fact, literally hundreds of U.S.
[01:07:25.346 --> 01:07:33.011]  corporations, including Halliburton and others, are now making their main headquarters there, not Houston or New York or Chicago or Los Angeles.
[01:07:34.611 --> 01:07:36.513]  Zed joins us from Dubai.
[01:07:36.573 --> 01:07:37.494]  Welcome, Zed.
[01:07:37.514 --> 01:07:38.454]  Thanks for calling.
[01:07:39.275 --> 01:07:39.635]  Thank you.
[01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:42.097]  Yeah, I want to talk about three things.
[01:07:42.277 --> 01:07:47.562]  About the mercury, the vaccines, the sterilization, and the Palm Islands that they're building in Dubai.
[01:07:48.002 --> 01:07:51.445]  But before I start, I want to talk about William Rodriguez.
[01:07:51.965 --> 01:07:54.267]  Do you know that he converted to Islam?
[01:07:55.368 --> 01:07:55.928]  I bet you know.
[01:07:56.509 --> 01:07:57.109]  I didn't know that.
[01:07:57.129 --> 01:07:57.710]  When did that happen?
[01:07:59.013 --> 01:08:11.121]  Uh, he, uh, well, a former Christian Muslim, I asked him if he knew, he, who lives in Austin, Texas, I asked him if he knew about Loose Change, and I wanted to talk about 9-11, but we ended up talking about William Rodriguez.
[01:08:11.161 --> 01:08:13.603]  He was like, oh, he converted to Islam and everything.
[01:08:14.163 --> 01:08:16.565]  I didn't ask about all the details, but, like, you can ask him yourself.
[01:08:17.045 --> 01:08:21.568]  Anyway, uh, you know, uh, my sister, she's, like, five years old.
[01:08:21.648 --> 01:08:27.052]  We moved here, like, six years ago, and, like, she was born here, and she had all her vaccines here.
[01:08:27.552 --> 01:08:28.293]  She's autistic.
[01:08:29.576 --> 01:08:43.106]  And next, about the sterilization, my friend, her sister, she got married to this Palestinian guy who has the American passport, and then she wanted the American passport.
[01:08:43.566 --> 01:08:46.668]  Her and her husband wanted to go to, like, America.
[01:08:47.268 --> 01:08:51.892]  So the embassy told her before she can go, she has to take a couple of vaccines.
[01:08:51.932 --> 01:08:52.692]  She's like, okay.
[01:08:53.493 --> 01:08:55.474]  And then guess how many vaccines they gave her?
[01:08:56.435 --> 01:08:56.655]  Guess.
[01:08:59.545 --> 01:09:04.166]  Six vaccines, and I'm not sure if it was all in one day or in sessions.
[01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:07.767]  I was about to say that was probably about ten is what I've seen the State Department demanding.
[01:09:08.168 --> 01:09:09.948]  See a couple of those are combo shots.
[01:09:10.408 --> 01:09:18.631]  A couple of those have... And then she got sick for like a week or something, something with her back, her nerves in her back or something, then she got all better.
[01:09:19.251 --> 01:09:22.052]  And then they thought that everything was fine, everything was okay.
[01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:24.691]  So they went on with their lives.
[01:09:25.072 --> 01:09:29.356]  Of course, they just got married and they wanted to start getting, she wanted to get pregnant.
[01:09:29.376 --> 01:09:32.720]  So months passed by and she couldn't get pregnant.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.483]  They went back to that same doctor who gave her the vaccines.
[01:09:36.043 --> 01:09:39.847]  And he's like, oh, there were some complications with the vaccines.
[01:09:39.888 --> 01:09:42.951]  And if it's not reversed, you can never expect to have children.
[01:09:44.022 --> 01:09:44.743]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:51.407]  They've been caught all over the planet adding hormones to the tetanus shot alone that sterilizes women permanently.
[01:09:51.947 --> 01:09:54.569]  Now, again, women aren't going to stop.
[01:09:54.589 --> 01:09:56.851]  They're going to take the shots and wonder why they can't have kids.
[01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:15.791]  Even though she knows it's from the vaccine.
[01:10:16.131 --> 01:10:18.891]  So they sterilize her and she still thinks you're bad.
[01:10:18.952 --> 01:10:19.332]  Okay, well.
[01:10:19.732 --> 01:10:23.453]  No, because she can't imagine someone doing such a thing, you know?
[01:10:23.473 --> 01:10:24.533]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:24.573 --> 01:10:27.754]  Anyway, they're building these palm islands in Dubai.
[01:10:27.774 --> 01:10:30.215]  These huge palm islands.
[01:10:30.455 --> 01:10:31.075]  I've seen them.
[01:10:31.355 --> 01:10:31.976]  They're beautiful.
[01:10:32.956 --> 01:10:33.276]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:33.816]  You saw them?
[01:10:34.736 --> 01:10:36.257]  Yes, I've seen the photos online.
[01:10:36.377 --> 01:10:37.977]  One of them's a gigantic owl.
[01:10:38.538 --> 01:10:40.418]  Others are in the shape of huge palm trees.
[01:10:40.738 --> 01:10:42.459]  They're building the tallest building in the world.
[01:10:42.559 --> 01:10:43.099]  It's going to be like
[01:10:44.232 --> 01:10:46.333]  I mean, how many feet taller than the biggest building?
[01:10:46.353 --> 01:10:53.054]  I'm not sure, but the funny thing is that not anyone can buy houses on those islands.
[01:10:53.634 --> 01:10:54.654]  Only specific people.
[01:10:55.574 --> 01:10:57.535]  So, you do the math.
[01:10:57.575 --> 01:10:58.675]  Maybe they're running away.
[01:10:58.695 --> 01:10:59.915]  I don't know.
[01:10:59.935 --> 01:11:01.916]  Maybe they're going to go to the Palm Islands or something.
[01:11:02.976 --> 01:11:03.296]  Anyway.
[01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:05.996]  Well, you know, that would be a good way.
[01:11:06.636 --> 01:11:09.257]  When Dick Cheney, who's... I have a flat pit by the house there.
[01:11:09.761 --> 01:11:12.663]  I heard Bob Pitt, he bought a health care, but he's not there now.
[01:11:12.783 --> 01:11:14.384]  Yeah, so is Dick Cheney.
[01:11:15.164 --> 01:11:17.745]  And they're doing that so they can get away from everybody.
[01:11:18.626 --> 01:11:18.946]  Yeah.
[01:11:19.346 --> 01:11:20.047]  They're huge.
[01:11:20.087 --> 01:11:21.547]  They started building them a couple years ago.
[01:11:22.088 --> 01:11:27.891]  And the manager of the engineering, his son, we were in the same class together.
[01:11:27.911 --> 01:11:30.072]  They're filthy rich.
[01:11:30.332 --> 01:11:31.193]  Filthy rich.
[01:11:31.233 --> 01:11:32.513]  Beyond your imagination.
[01:11:33.134 --> 01:11:33.434]  Anyway.
[01:11:33.654 --> 01:11:37.876]  And they get to join the club because they go along with the eugenics.
[01:11:38.597 --> 01:11:39.217]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:41.231]  And he's from Canada, the guy.
[01:11:41.711 --> 01:11:41.991]  Anyway.
[01:11:42.471 --> 01:11:44.052]  Amazing, I appreciate your call.
[01:11:44.072 --> 01:11:44.272]  Yeah.
[01:11:44.772 --> 01:11:51.395]  Yeah, some of the most amazing, just absolutely beautiful and incredible architecture is going on in Dubai.
[01:11:52.715 --> 01:11:56.857]  We have spent a lot of time drooling looking at it here at the office.
[01:11:57.577 --> 01:11:59.018]  That's the kind of stuff I'm into, folks.
[01:11:59.098 --> 01:12:04.500]  I'm into art, I'm into architecture, and we're into interesting construction projects.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.001]  We like those type of things.
[01:12:08.095 --> 01:12:11.537]  I don't wear a big gold chain around my neck, I'm not into bling, and I don't have a grill.
[01:12:12.718 --> 01:12:14.599]  We're into things that are interesting.
[01:12:15.199 --> 01:12:16.920]  And yeah, Dubai is just unbelievable.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:25.504]  I forget, it supposedly, I don't want to say it wrong, I want to say it's like 30, 40 stories bigger than any building in the world.
[01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:28.506]  And these are true stories.
[01:12:29.006 --> 01:12:32.388]  Like, they'll count the antenna on top of the Sears Tower is how high it is.
[01:12:33.098 --> 01:12:37.562]  And you know, the towers on top, the antennas, 20 stories or something.
[01:12:38.042 --> 01:12:38.723]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:40.304]  This is true stories.
[01:12:40.745 --> 01:12:45.188]  I mean, this looks like something out of a science fiction movie.
[01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:47.010]  And it's just absolutely incredible.
[01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.212]  Let's go ahead now.
[01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:51.894]  Notice you don't see those type of construction projects here.
[01:12:52.074 --> 01:12:53.095]  We're in decline.
[01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:55.477]  It's been done by design.
[01:12:59.131 --> 01:13:02.172]  But just stick a plastic flag on your car and everything will be alright.
[01:13:03.032 --> 01:13:06.253]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Wisconsin.
[01:13:06.273 --> 01:13:07.133]  Thanks for holding, Joe.
[01:13:07.153 --> 01:13:09.153]  Hey, good to speak to you, Alex.
[01:13:09.433 --> 01:13:10.133]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:13:10.193 --> 01:13:10.493]  Go ahead.
[01:13:10.733 --> 01:13:18.055]  Well, I'd like to comment on the economy, but I'd also like to make an impassioned plea for an attorney that's fed up with evil.
[01:13:18.575 --> 01:13:22.836]  As far as the economy goes, a friend of mine said, hey, did you see it drop 10%?
[01:13:23.016 --> 01:13:26.657]  I was like, yeah, well, of course it did.
[01:13:26.677 --> 01:13:28.077]  They made it happen that way.
[01:13:28.929 --> 01:13:36.192]  And I was, I called in in January and predicted that the housing market would cause all this collapse.
[01:13:36.492 --> 01:13:42.034]  I mean, it's pretty much smoke signal, you know, half a year ago, this was going to happen.
[01:13:42.414 --> 01:13:44.715]  If they wanted to do anything about it, they should have
[01:13:45.735 --> 01:13:47.436]  Yeah, they want their gold parachute.
[01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:11.416]  But what I also want to call about is a friend of mine and I are having massive campus police harassment at the local university.
[01:14:12.577 --> 01:14:15.279]  They're back door expelling me.
[01:14:15.659 --> 01:14:23.444]  You've been calling for years about all the problems at the school with you trying to use the computers and talk to people and do stuff and I always know when you call that's what it's about.
[01:14:23.704 --> 01:14:25.305]  How can we help you on this?
[01:14:25.786 --> 01:14:27.707]  Because I'm really sad this is happening to you.
[01:14:28.127 --> 01:14:31.930]  They had the case heard by a Marquette Law Professor Judge.
[01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:34.933]  And right there, I'm not allowed an attorney.
[01:14:34.953 --> 01:14:36.975]  So they claim it went to arbitration?
[01:14:37.856 --> 01:14:38.817]  Yeah.
[01:14:38.898 --> 01:14:42.642]  Which is not the true system, which is what they're trying to convert everything over to.
[01:14:42.722 --> 01:14:44.564]  So just bottom line, how can we help you sir?
[01:14:44.964 --> 01:14:50.090]  If there is an attorney listening, I am imploring people.
[01:14:50.623 --> 01:14:53.624]  You could make so much money, it would not be silly.
[01:14:53.684 --> 01:14:55.305]  Okay, we can't have a long pitch for lawyers.
[01:14:55.685 --> 01:14:56.285]  Here's the deal.
[01:14:56.405 --> 01:15:06.370]  I know you've been calling for years about this, and so I know you're a real individual, but if I let you give out your phone number, then others are going to try to call in and give out other people's phone numbers as a prank.
[01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.430]  Okay?
[01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:14.853]  So, so, and this is an international radio show, and whereas I want to help you, sir, this is, this has become quite a saga.
[01:15:15.073 --> 01:15:19.615]  So just come right to the case, an email, or somebody in the Wisconsin area that wants to help you.
[01:15:20.348 --> 01:15:28.571]  Yeah, I have my advisor and his phone number is... Sir, we are not... Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:15:29.311 --> 01:15:33.513]  Listen, I tried to let you get out an email or something so people could call and help you.
[01:15:33.973 --> 01:15:36.214]  And believe me, I believe you're being harassed at your school.
[01:15:37.374 --> 01:15:40.295]  But it never comes to a head.
[01:15:41.324 --> 01:15:44.105]  And, uh, that's just unbelievable.
[01:15:44.305 --> 01:15:45.345]  Look, I'm not trying to be your enemy.
[01:15:45.726 --> 01:15:46.786]  Joe, you're a really nice person.
[01:15:46.846 --> 01:15:47.986]  It's just that this has gone on too long.
[01:15:48.246 --> 01:15:50.447]  And I'm always trying to actually get your help when you call in.
[01:15:51.027 --> 01:15:53.528]  And instead, I'm not going to let people just call up folks at the school.
[01:15:54.829 --> 01:15:56.409]  David in San Diego.
[01:15:56.449 --> 01:15:57.150]  David, you're on the air.
[01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:57.490]  Go ahead.
[01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:59.770]  Hi, Alex.
[01:16:00.331 --> 01:16:01.531]  You're doing a great job.
[01:16:01.571 --> 01:16:03.252]  We really appreciate everything you do.
[01:16:03.272 --> 01:16:04.092]  I want you to know that.
[01:16:04.753 --> 01:16:12.577]  I'm still handing out the business cards, which say freedom or slavery, your choice with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:16:12.617 --> 01:16:14.158]  And I get about 30 emails a month.
[01:16:14.218 --> 01:16:20.882]  I thought you should know what people, new listeners, that are awakening to the Death to the New World Order here.
[01:16:21.142 --> 01:16:23.864]  Well, that's why we're having an effect, because people like you.
[01:16:23.904 --> 01:16:24.184]  Go ahead.
[01:16:25.365 --> 01:16:25.705]  All right.
[01:16:25.765 --> 01:16:28.666]  I have two suggestions for combating the police state.
[01:16:28.746 --> 01:16:29.407]  Number one,
[01:16:31.595 --> 01:16:32.856]  Many people may be aware of this.
[01:16:32.896 --> 01:16:39.337]  You can use Title 42, Section 1983, which is the deprivation of rights under color of law.
[01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:41.117]  Now, many people know about that.
[01:16:41.157 --> 01:16:52.120]  There's another aspect that many people may not be aware of, and that is a method of retaliation against corrupt cops, and it's under common law jurisdiction.
[01:16:52.893 --> 01:17:06.844]  When you have bonafide evidence that cops are acting in a corrupt manner, you march down to the courthouse and file a complaint, a formal complaint, against that officer for violating his oath of office.
[01:17:07.744 --> 01:17:13.489]  Now, in some jurisdictions, the police do not take a legitimate oath of office to uphold and defend the Constitution.
[01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:16.251]  They've taken an oath of office to the corporate municipality.
[01:17:17.559 --> 01:17:20.201]  But in most jurisdictions, they do take an oath of office.
[01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:24.325]  Now, there is a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule under common law.
[01:17:24.625 --> 01:17:27.507]  Now, we know the courts are pretty much totally corrupt nowadays.
[01:17:27.927 --> 01:17:29.449]  They don't acknowledge common law.
[01:17:30.209 --> 01:17:43.660]  And the solution is to file the complaint, and then post in public announcements in your local newspaper, citing the officer's name, the number of the complaint, and the subject matter of the complaint.
[01:17:44.272 --> 01:17:46.734]  This is a method of rooting out bad cops.
[01:17:46.794 --> 01:17:48.395]  And believe me, Alex, it works.
[01:17:48.715 --> 01:17:51.477]  Not in all cases, but it's very helpful.
[01:17:51.497 --> 01:17:53.798]  That's why you've got to do a cocktail of things.
[01:17:53.818 --> 01:17:56.540]  You can also file a civil rights action on them yourself.
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:01.503]  You can learn how to do that pretty easy with just some very small filing fees.
[01:18:01.543 --> 01:18:03.044]  And they're going to have to deal with it.
[01:18:03.064 --> 01:18:05.386]  Again, they can beat the rap, but they can't beat the ride.
[01:18:05.406 --> 01:18:08.488]  Then you hit them with an oath of office issue.
[01:18:09.228 --> 01:18:16.170]  Uh, you also file criminal complaints on them, and you hit them with three or four cocktails, and again, one of those torpedoes is going to hit them.
[01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:19.711]  And, uh, believe me, they're going to think twice before they stomp around.
[01:18:20.012 --> 01:18:24.233]  This is the thing, I see cops all the time on video, squad car videos, I've seen it myself.
[01:18:24.913 --> 01:18:30.695]  They will arrest you, you don't fight them, and they just throw a charge of resisting on you to, you know, to sue you with a pen.
[01:18:31.434 --> 01:18:33.495]  And when cops do that, they're trying to send you down.
[01:18:33.515 --> 01:18:35.035]  You need to go ahead and hit them back hard.
[01:18:35.495 --> 01:18:37.236]  And I mean hit them and hit them and hit them again.
[01:18:37.256 --> 01:18:39.117]  And you need to let them know what it's like.
[01:18:39.157 --> 01:18:40.457]  Hey, I'm a human being.
[01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.798]  I have value, you psychopathic scum.
[01:18:44.518 --> 01:18:48.440]  And now you're going to learn what it's like to have problems to deal with yourself, buddy boy.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:49.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:55.465 --> 01:19:06.732]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:19:06.952 --> 01:19:13.396]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:19:13.656 --> 01:19:14.297]  We're good to go!
[01:19:38.271 --> 01:19:40.794]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[01:19:40.834 --> 01:19:41.515]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[01:19:41.555 --> 01:19:41.815]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:41.875 --> 01:19:43.497]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:19:43.517 --> 01:19:44.439]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:54.438 --> 01:19:58.283]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:19:58.323 --> 01:19:59.585]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:19:59.745 --> 01:20:03.310]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:20:03.610 --> 01:20:06.134]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:20:06.534 --> 01:20:08.277]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:20:08.597 --> 01:20:10.900]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:20:11.961 --> 01:20:17.523]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:20.064]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:20:20.124 --> 01:20:21.564]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:20:29.727 --> 01:20:32.189]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[01:20:39.574 --> 01:20:42.857]  Each night when you sleep, your body uses the time to restore itself.
[01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:01.176]  So that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[01:21:01.716 --> 01:21:04.098]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[01:21:04.579 --> 01:21:12.326]  Now there's NightSkin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[01:21:12.847 --> 01:21:19.413]  NightSkin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[01:21:19.873 --> 01:21:25.115]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage.
[01:21:25.775 --> 01:21:27.376]  All while you get a good night's sleep.
[01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:33.058]  Try NightSkin today and see what it's like to wake up feeling renewed both inside and out.

[01:21:46.303 --> 01:21:46.663]  Call 1-800-894-3418.
[01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:49.864]  That's 1-800-894-3418.

[01:22:53.869 --> 01:23:02.775]  Alright, I want to get into a bunch of news coming up on Ron Paul, the war, the economy.
[01:23:03.135 --> 01:23:04.957]  So let's get through a bunch of your calls right now.
[01:23:04.977 --> 01:23:10.440]  Let's talk to Kyle in Iowa.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.361]  Kyle, you're on the air.
[01:23:11.401 --> 01:23:11.781]  Go ahead.
[01:23:12.241 --> 01:23:12.982]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:23:13.142 --> 01:23:13.582]  Good, sir.
[01:23:14.303 --> 01:23:17.165]  I just wanted to say, I was actually down at the straw polls.
[01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:21.948]  I didn't actually get down there until 5 o'clock and the voting ended at 6 and it almost seemed like it was entirely
[01:23:22.702 --> 01:23:23.843]  Ron Paul supporters there.
[01:23:24.924 --> 01:23:33.931]  And they had an independent group, I think it was FairTax.org that was doing it, but they were having people just write down who they voted for and their name.
[01:23:34.952 --> 01:23:36.574]  I was curious if you knew about that.
[01:23:36.614 --> 01:23:37.494]  Yes, that's the news.
[01:23:37.534 --> 01:23:46.202]  I mean, I've got an IM here or a post in the Prison Planet Forum asking me, you know, where are the people that were doing exit polls?
[01:23:46.242 --> 01:23:48.964]  And I said, I'd spent about
[01:23:50.473 --> 01:24:03.546]  I don't know, an hour or so surfing around Saturday night and Sunday, off and on, looking at local newscasts, reading what people are saying, and it would show outside a polling place, Ron Paul signs, people saying, I voted for Ron Paul, Ron Paul!
[01:24:04.087 --> 01:24:10.133]  And it said, groups are doing exit polling, and they said they're voting for Ron Paul, and then by the time it's Mitt Romney!
[01:24:10.413 --> 01:24:13.156]  The machine's all malfunctioned, but Mitt Romney!
[01:24:13.236 --> 01:24:13.856]  Everyone wants Mitt!
[01:24:16.043 --> 01:24:17.445]  It's very suspicious.
[01:24:17.765 --> 01:24:20.487]  So you were there and what did you see?
[01:24:21.408 --> 01:24:24.870]  Well, it was pretty much died down by the time I got there.
[01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:28.974]  It was just kind of the last stragglers that were kind of coming in and voting and stuff.
[01:24:29.034 --> 01:24:31.716]  And I know I talked to at least four to six people.
[01:24:32.489 --> 01:24:37.853]  To vote for Ron Paul, I gave out a bunch of copies of Freedom to Fascism, Terror, Storm and Relief Change while I was out there.
[01:24:37.893 --> 01:24:39.013]  I had a big double bag full.
[01:24:39.033 --> 01:24:47.539]  See, that's why they had to at least have Paul at five instead of like six or seven or eight like Giuliani, McCain and Thompson because he really won.
[01:24:47.579 --> 01:24:51.682]  I mean, that's clear from the exit polls and everything else and the Diebold mysterious behavior.
[01:24:51.702 --> 01:24:53.924]  So five, it's kind of like, yeah, he showed up a little.
[01:24:54.624 --> 01:24:56.365]  But don't worry, Diebold gets to vote.
[01:24:56.405 --> 01:24:57.146]  Everything's fine.
[01:24:57.546 --> 01:25:01.749]  And so you talked to a bunch, to four or five people, and what percentage said Ron Paul?
[01:25:02.849 --> 01:25:05.651]  Well, a lot of people I talked to were voting for Ron Paul.
[01:25:05.771 --> 01:25:14.575]  The four or five people that I mentioned were kind of sitting on the fence because they had someone that was supporting Sam Brownback talking to them.
[01:25:14.595 --> 01:25:16.596]  So, how many people did you talk to, Ballpark?
[01:25:16.856 --> 01:25:17.797]  How many were for Ron Paul?
[01:25:17.817 --> 01:25:20.998]  How many for Brownback?
[01:25:21.319 --> 01:25:22.039]  Dogs are free.
[01:25:22.139 --> 01:25:22.559]  I don't care.
[01:25:22.579 --> 01:25:23.019]  Just answer.
[01:25:23.059 --> 01:25:24.440]  Just tell us.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:29.463]  Well, I would probably say 95% of the people I talked to were voting for Ron Paul.
[01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:35.670]  Out of how many people?
[01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:41.432]  Just about everyone that was there that wasn't, like, a volunteer.
[01:25:41.972 --> 01:25:42.512]  Did you talk to 20?
[01:25:42.552 --> 01:25:43.652]  Did you talk to 30?
[01:25:43.692 --> 01:25:46.633]  Yeah, probably.
[01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:47.433]  At least that.
[01:25:47.613 --> 01:25:48.114]  At least that.
[01:25:48.294 --> 01:25:48.794]  Okay, let's say 35, 40?
[01:25:48.854 --> 01:25:50.034]  I mean, you estimate here.
[01:25:50.054 --> 01:25:51.334]  Yeah, we'll just say 35.
[01:25:51.374 --> 01:25:53.115]  So you talked to about 35 people and 95% of them
[01:25:58.493 --> 01:26:00.593]  Well, you talked about 35 and you're saying four of them.
[01:26:00.633 --> 01:26:00.953]  That's about 95%.
[01:26:01.214 --> 01:26:03.314]  Four of them weren't sure.
[01:26:04.074 --> 01:26:04.734]  Right, right.
[01:26:04.934 --> 01:26:08.155]  Now, which specific straw poll polling place were you at?
[01:26:10.595 --> 01:26:11.995]  I guess I didn't know there was more than one.
[01:26:12.035 --> 01:26:15.396]  I just went to the one that was at the stadium down there in Ames.
[01:26:15.496 --> 01:26:16.216]  Yeah, the big one, yeah.
[01:26:16.696 --> 01:26:18.197]  I guess that is the main one, yeah.
[01:26:18.497 --> 01:26:19.817]  Yeah, that's the one I went to.
[01:26:19.837 --> 01:26:21.337]  I guess I didn't know there was any others.
[01:26:21.957 --> 01:26:25.518]  I just tried to get down to voting as quick as I could and then I handed out some DVDs.
[01:26:27.667 --> 01:26:30.610]  No, that is the big one with the dinner and all that.
[01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:32.291]  That's the one that they've got.
[01:26:32.471 --> 01:26:35.014]  I've got to look into more of that.
[01:26:35.254 --> 01:26:43.401]  I just saw on the newscast reporting different places, but watching 10, 15 different newscasts, I need to talk to some Iowans and find out all the specifics of that.
[01:26:43.781 --> 01:26:53.709]  I just know that it was just Ron Paul everywhere, Ron Paul at the stadium, people saying, I voted for Ron Paul, the news saying, well they say they're voting for Ron Paul, and then they made the announcement that Mitt Romney had won.
[01:26:53.969 --> 01:26:55.671]  Do you smell a big stinking rat?
[01:26:56.351 --> 01:27:03.593]  Well, I actually, because I brought down a buddy of mine, and I was like, you know what, I think Ron Paul's going to win it, but I was like, don't be shocked if there's a problem with these machines.
[01:27:04.593 --> 01:27:06.694]  And I was absolutely right.
[01:27:06.774 --> 01:27:10.215]  You know, I was like, oh, the double machines, they're not working.
[01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:17.277]  You know, it's as soon as I left before 7 o'clock when they were supposed to post the results.
[01:27:17.955 --> 01:27:21.237]  I called my wife to look on the internet and she didn't find anything until I was almost home.
[01:27:21.257 --> 01:27:22.598]  But then they couldn't release them.
[01:27:22.638 --> 01:27:25.380]  They always have to come in and fix a problem first.
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:28.442]  And then it's knit.
[01:27:29.363 --> 01:27:30.063]  Oh, of course, yeah.
[01:27:30.103 --> 01:27:40.050]  And I actually saw a Fox News article after I got home saying that they had predicted that there were going to be problems with it and that the Ron Paul supporters were right, that they should be
[01:27:41.071 --> 01:27:49.533]  Uh, but they didn't trust it because they had... Yeah, Saturday night I was driving and heard Fox News on LBJ locally, the national fog, and they admitted, they said, Ron Paul's people were right.
[01:27:49.553 --> 01:27:51.434]  They said there'd be problems in their world with Diebold.
[01:27:51.894 --> 01:27:52.034]  Yeah.
[01:27:52.054 --> 01:27:53.454]  But Ron Paul still came in fifth.
[01:27:54.774 --> 01:28:05.277]  Yeah, no, I thought it was... I thought it was ridiculous because you had, like, Sam Brownback and Mitt Romney, especially, that had, like, they had rock climbing walls and just all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:28:05.357 --> 01:28:09.038]  I was... he just meant to lure people in, like, hey, we're fun, we're fun, you know, but
[01:28:09.468 --> 01:28:14.193]  The only people that were there, I mean, there were so many people that were still there for Ron Paul, like sitting around in his tent and everything.
[01:28:15.295 --> 01:28:19.439]  You know, there was almost no one else there that was there for their candidate afterwards.
[01:28:19.479 --> 01:28:22.943]  I mean, it was almost entirely volunteers, much less Ron Paul supporters.
[01:28:23.083 --> 01:28:25.286]  Well, we're going to play a stadium clip coming up later.
[01:28:26.454 --> 01:28:28.336]  Where we had to cut out two minutes of chanting.
[01:28:28.356 --> 01:28:29.277]  They wouldn't even let him talk.
[01:28:29.777 --> 01:28:35.482]  And you watch when the video starts in the arena at the main, you know, building.
[01:28:36.022 --> 01:28:38.284]  And I have to say, 80% of people were there for Ron Paul.
[01:28:38.785 --> 01:28:40.746]  Frankly, you can't see anybody else for anybody else.
[01:28:41.927 --> 01:28:43.589]  Except for Lauren Ingram up there snaking.
[01:28:44.089 --> 01:28:45.010]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:47.072]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.992 --> 01:28:50.675]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.105 --> 01:28:58.667]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:02.008]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:29:02.328 --> 01:29:04.889]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:29:05.249 --> 01:29:10.071]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:29:10.452 --> 01:29:15.814]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:29:16.134 --> 01:29:19.095]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:29:19.275 --> 01:29:19.855]  We're good to go.
[01:29:42.686 --> 01:29:49.412]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:29:50.713 --> 01:29:51.213]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:29:51.413 --> 01:29:56.698]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:56.758 --> 01:30:03.563]  Did you know that at the 29 Palm Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[01:30:03.583 --> 01:30:07.106]  It discussed the United States military under U.N.
[01:30:07.186 --> 01:30:07.587]  command.
[01:30:08.291 --> 01:30:09.733]  Would the Marines accept this?
[01:30:09.953 --> 01:30:20.723]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[01:30:21.204 --> 01:30:22.605]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:30:22.745 --> 01:30:24.547]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[01:30:25.087 --> 01:30:32.595]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:31:03.654 --> 01:31:04.274]  Hard-hitting?
[01:31:04.635 --> 01:31:07.597]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[01:31:07.617 --> 01:31:09.119]  War in Iran?
[01:31:09.639 --> 01:31:11.281]  A coming One World Church?
[01:31:12.041 --> 01:31:17.345]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[01:31:49.435 --> 01:31:51.117]  Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.
[01:32:09.719 --> 01:32:17.481]  Yeah, I knew I'd seen Iowa Newscast, where they talk about multiple polling places, and I knew I'd seen them say, now let's go to the other polling place.
[01:32:17.841 --> 01:32:21.082]  There were three polling places, but in one county.
[01:32:22.123 --> 01:32:27.845]  In the Hilton Coliseum, the Sherman Building, and the C.Y.
[01:32:27.885 --> 01:32:35.847]  Stevens Auditorium, with the Diebold machines, and this is put out by IowaPolitics.com press release,
[01:32:37.034 --> 01:32:38.375]  Voting at the Iowa Straw Poll.
[01:32:38.495 --> 01:32:40.457]  Fraud-proof, honest, and secure.
[01:32:40.497 --> 01:32:40.677]  Yes.
[01:32:41.118 --> 01:32:43.079]  Die-bold, decertified machines.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:47.563]  Fraud-ridden with their own engineers and people going public saying they were hired for fraud.
[01:32:48.664 --> 01:32:50.566]  You've got wall-to-wall Ron Paul people.
[01:32:51.046 --> 01:33:00.855]  Everybody we talked to, the little local news clips I said that we've seen are people saying that, hey, you know, Ron Paul, Ron Paul, Ron Paul.
[01:33:01.936 --> 01:33:03.017]  We're just talking to a listener.
[01:33:03.982 --> 01:33:05.943]  Who was there and saw the vast majority.
[01:33:06.444 --> 01:33:12.327]  Being for Ron Paul, he talked to 35 people, he said, and four of them weren't sure who they were going to vote for going in.
[01:33:13.508 --> 01:33:15.869]  Yeah, we need to go check FairTax.org and a few other sites.
[01:33:15.889 --> 01:33:18.171]  And you can get a big article out on this at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:18.691 --> 01:33:20.032]  Or maybe JonesReport.com.
[01:33:20.212 --> 01:33:21.773]  We'll have that out by this evening, I guarantee it.
[01:33:22.553 --> 01:33:24.054]  If the hair lives the Admiral, as they say.
[01:33:24.634 --> 01:33:26.716]  If the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek.
[01:33:28.017 --> 01:33:28.577]  But, um...
[01:33:30.507 --> 01:33:31.188]  There you go!
[01:33:31.288 --> 01:33:40.635]  I mean, we're going to play a Ron Paul clip, about an eight minute clip, coming up here in a few minutes, then go back to your calls and get into a bunch of international news and national news, really important stuff in the next hour.
[01:33:40.975 --> 01:33:42.836]  Are they coming with the national draft?
[01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:52.904]  The ominous signs that yes, and now the head of the wars are, over the war, is saying that yeah, a draft would be a good thing, that we need one.
[01:33:54.766 --> 01:33:56.507]  So that's coming up, but to Adam Locke,
[01:33:57.777 --> 01:33:59.598]  I've known him since his WWCR days.
[01:33:59.658 --> 01:34:01.320]  I guess I've known Adam off and on for about 12 years.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.281]  He has been over at New Millennium Concepts for now more than a year.
[01:34:04.682 --> 01:34:08.164]  They are the Made in America maker of the American Berkey.
[01:34:08.184 --> 01:34:10.926]  They also distribute, the national distributor of the British Berkey.
[01:34:10.946 --> 01:34:12.187]  Get either one, they're both excellent.
[01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:15.449]  Because you get about 40% off store prices.
[01:34:15.589 --> 01:34:17.570]  Sometimes less, sometimes more depending on the item.
[01:34:18.991 --> 01:34:20.973]  I've seen people buy the same filters you can buy for $195 for $350.
[01:34:23.644 --> 01:34:24.204]  We're good to go.
[01:34:47.162 --> 01:34:49.023]  Because I love to give the gift of life.
[01:34:49.203 --> 01:34:52.965]  And folks, we say get them for hurricanes, or get them for earthquakes, or get them for disasters.
[01:34:53.706 --> 01:34:55.447]  Look, the disaster's going on right now.
[01:34:56.007 --> 01:35:00.030]  You shouldn't be drinking tap water that this criminal government puts out there.
[01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:01.370]  You cannot trust them.
[01:35:02.491 --> 01:35:04.732]  And I know they got movies making fun of it in Hollywood.
[01:35:04.752 --> 01:35:06.473]  You know, oh, they think fluoride's bad.
[01:35:06.533 --> 01:35:07.114]  Ha ha ha.
[01:35:07.534 --> 01:35:09.615]  Calcium fluoride in low levels is good for you.
[01:35:10.195 --> 01:35:14.518]  Sodium and stannous fluoride mixed in with the Grignard reagents and the heavy metals.
[01:35:15.433 --> 01:35:16.714]  Top scientists are on records.
[01:35:17.214 --> 01:35:21.955]  The head, the dentist in Canada who helped get it passed 15 years ago has now gone public and said he was conned.
[01:35:21.996 --> 01:35:22.816]  It's deadly poison.
[01:35:24.156 --> 01:35:25.517]  And fluoride is so hard to get out.
[01:35:25.577 --> 01:35:29.558]  New Millennium has their own patented filters that do knock it out.
[01:35:30.499 --> 01:35:31.899]  Normal gravity filters won't even do this.
[01:35:31.919 --> 01:35:33.740]  You've got to buy an extra post filter with it.
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:41.703]  And instead of doing, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 gallons depending on the system, when you add these to theirs it just does, I don't know, 6, 7 gallons a day.
[01:35:42.572 --> 01:35:47.673]  Because, depending on the unit, because it's just, it's two huge filters that it goes through.
[01:35:47.693 --> 01:35:49.834]  Takes about two minutes to put together, though.
[01:35:50.594 --> 01:36:01.677]  And, or you can continue to drink fluoride and love the government and trust them and take your vaccines and just, just, just give your children tap water and, uh... My parents, you know, people are smart.
[01:36:02.739 --> 01:36:08.501]  But we get in the habit, like I bought my parents a big Birkin and I use it off and on, but I still see them drinking tap water and I tell them, don't do that!
[01:36:09.041 --> 01:36:09.941]  Don't trust the government!
[01:36:10.842 --> 01:36:14.143]  Look, regardless, it makes your water taste a lot better.
[01:36:15.143 --> 01:36:25.826]  Adam Locke, I'm here diatribing, it's just that if people don't call, and it's simple, I pitched high quality, affordable food, I said people ought to get gold, they ought to get guns, we don't sell guns here, wish we did.
[01:36:25.846 --> 01:36:28.267]  I can't deal with that paperwork.
[01:36:29.486 --> 01:36:36.279]  It's just people need to get high quality water filters and you guys have got the best and make the best and distribute the second best.
[01:36:36.299 --> 01:36:38.943]  So, I don't see how people wouldn't call and get this.
[01:36:40.618 --> 01:36:41.699]  First off, Alex, thank you.
[01:36:41.719 --> 01:36:43.641]  Gee, you don't leave me a whole lot to say.
[01:36:43.661 --> 01:36:45.944]  I mean, you're on a roll here, and you're doing a great job.
[01:36:47.225 --> 01:36:48.186]  I'll just let you continue.
[01:36:48.586 --> 01:36:53.351]  It's interesting, you bring up the PF2s, which are the post-reduction filters for arsenic and fluoride reduction.
[01:36:53.371 --> 01:36:55.353]  1,000 gallons is what they're rated at.
[01:36:55.694 --> 01:36:59.498]  And that's because, again, as you said, fluoride is a volatile thing.
[01:37:00.198 --> 01:37:01.560]  And that's as far as they're going to go.
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.205]  The elements themselves, the black berkey elements, are rated at 3,000 gallons apiece.
[01:37:05.245 --> 01:37:14.596]  So typically, people are buying the PF2s in pairs or three to run the same amount of time as the black berkey elements would run.
[01:37:14.776 --> 01:37:15.437]  Now explain that.
[01:37:15.457 --> 01:37:19.222]  You can seat one in the stainless steel or Lexan canister.
[01:37:19.562 --> 01:37:33.896]  But the water goes in the barrel or you can put three or four in there to really get a faster volume and it'll last what three, six, nine, well with three filters it would be 9,000 gallons which basically folks that's a long time for drinking water.
[01:37:34.496 --> 01:37:37.699]  It really is and you're right that's exactly the way they're set up.
[01:37:37.719 --> 01:37:41.282]  3,000 gallons per element typically our systems come with at least two elements.
[01:37:41.303 --> 01:37:42.824]  You're looking at 6,000 gallons.
[01:37:43.485 --> 01:37:44.866]  Take a big Berkey for example.
[01:37:45.812 --> 01:37:47.654]  Uh, it's going to run three and a half gallons an hour.
[01:37:47.674 --> 01:37:51.057]  Of course, if you double at the four elements, now you're doing about seven gallons an hour.
[01:37:51.398 --> 01:37:52.539]  Eighty-four gallons a day.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.122]  Uh, 2,667 gallons roughly.
[01:37:56.142 --> 01:37:58.264]  Uh, or no, excuse me, number of fills.
[01:37:59.065 --> 01:38:00.827]  Uh, before you're going to have to replace those elements.
[01:38:01.287 --> 01:38:07.170]  When you sit down and do the math and start figuring this out, you're looking at about 2 cents a gallon.
[01:38:07.671 --> 01:38:10.292]  That's all it's going to cost you.
[01:38:10.472 --> 01:38:13.674]  Meanwhile, 12 ounces of Aquafina cost 95 cents.
[01:38:14.034 --> 01:38:14.515]  Exactly.
[01:38:14.615 --> 01:38:15.535]  That's what I was going to say.
[01:38:15.795 --> 01:38:19.197]  You're going to buy bottled water all day long, but you're going to pay a whole lot more money for it.
[01:38:19.457 --> 01:38:22.019]  And you're going to get the leaching of dioxins out of the plastic.
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.701]  That's very possible, yes.
[01:38:24.502 --> 01:38:30.648]  You know, Alex, we're going to bring up, and I haven't talked about it in any of the shows yet, so you're the first in the Atlantic hurricane season.
[01:38:30.668 --> 01:38:33.411]  You know, we've been talking about it in the past.
[01:38:33.791 --> 01:38:36.053]  They just came out last week and revised their predictions.
[01:38:36.373 --> 01:38:38.976]  They've downgraded the whole thing slightly.
[01:38:39.877 --> 01:38:43.180]  Now NOAA is calling for about 13 to 16 name storms this year.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:43.921]  That's good news.
[01:38:44.401 --> 01:38:47.745]  Maybe three to five major hurricanes, winds over 110 miles an hour.
[01:38:48.185 --> 01:38:56.033]  What they're saying though, and this is something people need to consider, just because we haven't seen anything yet this year doesn't mean anything, according to NOAA.
[01:38:56.474 --> 01:39:05.584]  We still have conditions for an above normal season, and typically it's between August and November that all of the activity happens.
[01:39:06.738 --> 01:39:10.723]  So, we're still at potentially the head end of a lot of stuff happening.
[01:39:11.143 --> 01:39:17.931]  Unfortunately, what has happened, and it just isn't here in the States, it's been around the world, is flooding over the past couple of months.
[01:39:18.696 --> 01:39:20.138]  I just go on and on with the list.
[01:39:20.238 --> 01:39:23.801]  We've had a bunch of communities around Austin where you couldn't drink water for weeks.
[01:39:24.201 --> 01:39:24.682]  Exactly.
[01:39:24.722 --> 01:39:25.823]  Central Texas got hit.
[01:39:25.883 --> 01:39:32.389]  Kansas, Missouri, South Asia, Ireland, Oklahoma, New York, Florida, Sudan, China, Norway.
[01:39:32.909 --> 01:39:35.231]  England records the wettest month on record.
[01:39:35.412 --> 01:39:38.254]  Northern England, yeah, wettest month on record in Texas.
[01:39:38.595 --> 01:39:39.135]  That's correct.
[01:39:39.455 --> 01:39:42.198]  Burma, New Zealand, and just, you know, in the last couple of weeks,
[01:39:42.897 --> 01:39:43.238]  Vietnam.
[01:39:43.338 --> 01:39:45.581]  Of course, parts of Britain get hit again.
[01:39:45.601 --> 01:39:46.062]  Qatar.
[01:39:46.162 --> 01:39:50.308]  And again, when it floods, sewage treatment plants overflow and go into reservoirs.
[01:39:50.748 --> 01:39:53.212]  Folks, bottom line... That's the problem, yes.
[01:39:53.692 --> 01:39:55.515]  Bottom line, you need to get a Big Berkey.
[01:39:55.535 --> 01:39:59.721]  Tell them about a few of the different elements, a few of the different packages and some of the free items you get with it.
[01:40:00.456 --> 01:40:03.679]  Well, of course, you've got the sport bottle that is available.
[01:40:03.699 --> 01:40:04.780]  It's a wonderful little thing.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:10.644]  You can dip it in a local creek if you're hiking or camping, and those typically come with a system.
[01:40:11.004 --> 01:40:12.886]  Mention, of course, that you heard it on the Power Hour.
[01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:15.208]  You can always call Debbie and tell her the same thing.
[01:40:16.108 --> 01:40:20.572]  Debbie's always happy to talk to your listeners, and she knows all of the specials going on, too.
[01:40:20.592 --> 01:40:23.754]  Yeah, you've got to say the Alex Jones Show are one of the best shows.
[01:40:24.115 --> 01:40:25.456]  Yes, yes, you really do.
[01:40:26.216 --> 01:40:27.977]  And Debbie knows you've got the sport bottle.
[01:40:28.357 --> 01:40:33.739]  I think we've got an LED flashlight, little five function flashlight, as opposed to the bottle that people like.
[01:40:34.659 --> 01:40:36.480]  Again, just ask Deb what's going on.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.941]  Of course, Alex, you've got stuff right on your website, too.
[01:40:38.961 --> 01:40:43.102]  They can go there, in order, or they can go, of course, to ours at Berkeywater.com.
[01:40:43.162 --> 01:40:47.724]  And if you go to our site again, make sure you mention that you heard it on Alex's show.
[01:40:48.724 --> 01:40:50.585]  Absolutely, and then you get those discounts.
[01:40:50.625 --> 01:40:58.369]  You can get a sports bottle that doesn't cut all the fluoride out, it reduces it, but it cuts out all the bacteria, all the pathogens, all the main things that'll make you sick.
[01:40:58.409 --> 01:41:03.491]  It'll do about 112 refills in swamp water, 600 and something refills.
[01:41:03.511 --> 01:41:05.812]  This is certified with tap water.
[01:41:05.852 --> 01:41:14.576]  You take it to the gym, you take it to work, and then it just reduces and makes the water taste a lot better and basically brings it up to above water bottle quality.
[01:41:14.596 --> 01:41:16.657]  That's all they do is run it through the classic filter.
[01:41:17.297 --> 01:41:19.380]  Uh, and you can get a free one of those, or you can get what?
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:21.081]  Can you still get five of those for $99?
[01:41:21.301 --> 01:41:22.883]  Yes, you can.
[01:41:22.903 --> 01:41:28.309]  By the way, folks, buying these at camping supply stores are like $30 a piece, so this is a big discount.
[01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:30.010]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you 1-888-803-4438.
[01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.271]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:41:38.559 --> 01:41:45.941]  And I really do believe in this, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that you will not do it for hurricanes, and not do it for earthquakes, and not do it for chupacabras.
[01:41:46.402 --> 01:41:48.442]  You know, I mean, earthquakes and stuff, that is a problem.
[01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:50.043]  But don't wait until that happens.
[01:41:50.783 --> 01:41:59.806]  The reason to do this is they're putting sterilization compounds and toxic poison compounds in your water supply by design to hurt you.
[01:41:59.866 --> 01:42:01.086]  We have thousands of studies.
[01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:02.667]  It is a scientific fact.
[01:42:03.147 --> 01:42:05.569]  They have Pulitzer Prize winning books on World War II.
[01:42:05.829 --> 01:42:11.573]  They talk about how the Nazis put it in the water in their work camps to make people docile to sodium and stannous fluoride.
[01:42:11.874 --> 01:42:14.456]  And I'm sick of it, and I don't drink tap water.
[01:42:14.856 --> 01:42:19.499]  And you've also got one of the highest quality shower filters that cuts this stuff out.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:22.221]  And that's where you breathe it in, in the gas form.
[01:42:22.482 --> 01:42:23.663]  It goes through your skin.
[01:42:24.183 --> 01:42:26.645]  My children use the filter we bought from you.
[01:42:27.565 --> 01:42:28.965]  Folks, they've got those.
[01:42:28.985 --> 01:42:30.546]  888-803-4438.
[01:42:30.566 --> 01:42:31.306]  888-803-4438.
[01:42:31.346 --> 01:42:38.547]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get those discounts.
[01:42:38.627 --> 01:42:39.608]  Adam, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:42:40.108 --> 01:42:40.588]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:40.648 --> 01:42:41.188]  Always a pleasure.
[01:42:41.428 --> 01:42:42.228]  You bet, my friend.
[01:42:42.248 --> 01:42:42.588]  888-803-4438.
[01:42:42.888 --> 01:42:49.250]  By the way, before I go back to your calls and play this Ron Paul clip, I'm just going to go ahead and say this.
[01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:50.630]  I mean, why not go ahead and talk about this?
[01:42:51.090 --> 01:42:52.110]  Let me see if I can find it.
[01:42:52.650 --> 01:42:55.611]  I'm looking at the forum.prisonplanet.com.
[01:42:56.463 --> 01:42:59.284]  And we've got live blogging during AJ's show.
[01:43:00.104 --> 01:43:03.344]  Now you can ask me live questions in here and I'm going to do a few of these.
[01:43:04.004 --> 01:43:09.825]  But there's one of these, now I'm trying to find it, there's well over a hundred just today asking me questions and now I can't find it.
[01:43:10.106 --> 01:43:12.586]  There was a guy saying, hey, stop plugging stuff!
[01:43:13.066 --> 01:43:16.987]  Stop every, you know, couple times a week for ten minutes having us sponsored on.
[01:43:17.267 --> 01:43:19.007]  We're sick of it, we don't want to hear it.
[01:43:20.927 --> 01:43:23.688]  Let me give you a little news flash about the real world, and believe me, I understand that.
[01:43:24.787 --> 01:43:30.471]  We really attempt here and succeed, if we're going to have sponsorship, that it's going to be stuff that's really good for you.
[01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:33.894]  Like, hey, you might want to filter that water.
[01:43:34.974 --> 01:43:43.521]  I mean, even if you trust the government, they admit they just chlorinate it and it kills the bacteria, so you're drinking dead bacteria, which are toxic, and which are hard on the liver.
[01:43:44.561 --> 01:43:46.763]  But if I'm going to pitch something, it's what I believe in.
[01:43:47.083 --> 01:43:48.544]  I mean, I believe in multivitamins.
[01:43:49.165 --> 01:43:50.265]  I believe in water filters.
[01:43:50.566 --> 01:43:52.867]  I don't sell guns, and I'm telling you to buy guns all the time.
[01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:55.631]  I believe in gold.
[01:43:55.711 --> 01:43:56.452]  I said get gold.
[01:43:56.492 --> 01:43:57.613]  It's more than doubled in price.
[01:43:57.833 --> 01:43:59.174]  That wasn't a very hard call.
[01:43:59.655 --> 01:44:02.738]  I mean, the dollar's being devalued, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:03.158 --> 01:44:04.700]  They've been artificially suppressing gold.
[01:44:06.121 --> 01:44:07.042]  And look, it's already doubled.
[01:44:08.603 --> 01:44:10.705]  But let me give you a little news flash here.
[01:44:10.966 --> 01:44:13.468]  I have 12 employees.
[01:44:13.548 --> 01:44:18.133]  Do you know how much it costs to pay 12 people?
[01:44:18.173 --> 01:44:19.374]  And by the way, I don't do like a lot of
[01:44:20.616 --> 01:44:25.159]  People I know, just in business, period, who don't pay their people enough to even live.
[01:44:25.219 --> 01:44:27.641]  I try to give bonuses when we have the money come in.
[01:44:28.501 --> 01:44:34.665]  I try to, whenever there's some extra money, whenever we aren't just breaking even, a couple times a year when that happens.
[01:44:37.647 --> 01:44:40.069]  I mean, my goodness, we don't pay for AM and FM stations.
[01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:42.110]  Well, that's not true.
[01:44:42.130 --> 01:44:48.134]  There's one or two that have, from years ago, that were kind of grandfathered that asked us to give them a little bit of help, and we have.
[01:44:51.181 --> 01:44:52.262]  We do pay for the shortwave.
[01:44:52.342 --> 01:44:53.683]  It's $10,000 a month.
[01:44:55.265 --> 01:44:56.385]  Let's just go ahead and talk about this.
[01:44:57.326 --> 01:45:02.911]  To have WWCR, three hours during the day, 11 to 2, and then 9 to midnight for everybody.
[01:45:03.671 --> 01:45:15.801]  And frankly, it doesn't really convert back to any type of profit for us, but we get letters from South Africa, and letters from Asia, and letters from missionaries, and letters from people in Russia, and ships at sea are listening.
[01:45:15.841 --> 01:45:17.223]  I mean, there's a lot of listeners on shortwave.
[01:45:17.783 --> 01:45:19.244]  So we do it as a world service here.
[01:45:19.264 --> 01:45:19.645]  $10,000 a month.
[01:45:20.811 --> 01:45:23.953]  And guess who the sponsor is that ends up most months paying most of it?
[01:45:23.993 --> 01:45:25.094]  You just heard who they are.
[01:45:25.494 --> 01:45:29.636]  So, number one, I'm pitching high-quality water filters, and that's what pays for it.
[01:45:30.577 --> 01:45:31.477]  You get a discount.
[01:45:31.758 --> 01:45:33.619]  They are the leader in gravity-fed filters.
[01:45:33.639 --> 01:45:36.901]  You get a good deal on top of it, and that's why we do it.
[01:45:37.221 --> 01:45:40.162]  You wouldn't hear shortwave if it wasn't for you, you just heard.
[01:45:40.403 --> 01:45:41.723]  Because I don't have that type of money.
[01:45:42.304 --> 01:45:43.344]  Now there's the Internet.
[01:45:43.664 --> 01:45:47.687]  I'm paying, bandwidth-wise now, victims of our own success,
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:50.761]  I'm about to buy more, by the way.
[01:45:50.821 --> 01:45:55.125]  I have to, or just not serve people.
[01:45:55.145 --> 01:45:56.826]  $12,000 a month right now on that.
[01:45:57.807 --> 01:45:59.929]  And that's not counting all of our IT.
[01:46:00.529 --> 01:46:01.050]  Okay.
[01:46:01.930 --> 01:46:05.653]  And then I got 12 employees!
[01:46:05.673 --> 01:46:06.494]  12 employees!
[01:46:09.356 --> 01:46:12.739]  Not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:18.344]  Okay, and you know, you don't hear General Motors on this show, or Slave Mart.
[01:46:19.011 --> 01:46:19.552]  On this show.
[01:46:20.153 --> 01:46:20.514]  Okay?
[01:46:21.635 --> 01:46:28.146]  So, uh, I'm very thankful to our Eminem affiliates, and I want you to support their local sponsors, and if you're a local, listen to those.
[01:46:28.166 --> 01:46:30.530]  If you have a business, sponsor that station, and thank them.
[01:46:31.451 --> 01:46:32.272]  Don't just support us.
[01:46:32.393 --> 01:46:33.094]  I try to have...
[01:46:34.176 --> 01:46:36.717]  I used to have other Genesis hosts on and try to promote them.
[01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:38.997]  I still have some of them on, like Butch Bono.
[01:46:39.057 --> 01:46:40.398]  Others didn't seem to appreciate it or like it.
[01:46:40.418 --> 01:46:43.338]  I seem to antagonize them more to the huge response they got on the show.
[01:46:43.358 --> 01:46:44.639]  I said, okay, go your way.
[01:46:46.259 --> 01:46:49.640]  But I carry this whole network on my back.
[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:55.841]  I've got four times the listeners, not just on AM and FM dial, but shortwave, internet, every indicator we've got.
[01:46:55.861 --> 01:46:58.482]  I've got about four times the entire Genesis network.
[01:46:59.941 --> 01:47:02.163]  And it's because I have been a decent steward.
[01:47:02.503 --> 01:47:07.467]  I didn't get a little money in my hands ten years ago and run off and buy some sparkly thing.
[01:47:08.067 --> 01:47:10.069]  I put it back in over and over.
[01:47:10.309 --> 01:47:12.911]  More websites, hiring more people, doing more.
[01:47:12.951 --> 01:47:13.572]  That's what I do.
[01:47:15.713 --> 01:47:19.016]  Doesn't mean I don't go get the big enchilada plate though with the money you send me.
[01:47:19.076 --> 01:47:21.878]  I do do that and I need to get new tires on my car.
[01:47:21.898 --> 01:47:22.639]  I got money to do it.
[01:47:22.659 --> 01:47:23.880]  I'm just so busy working.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.661]  I haven't had time to get new tires.
[01:47:25.701 --> 01:47:27.843]  But see, that's why we do this.
[01:47:28.886 --> 01:47:36.588]  And so if, and so I'll go, well let me see, video sales aren't paying for all these employees and aren't paying for all this bandwidth.
[01:47:36.768 --> 01:47:40.609]  I'm going to hustle and I'm going to go get some sponsors I believe in.
[01:47:41.090 --> 01:47:42.990]  Let me see what products I think are good out there.
[01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:45.751]  Let me call up and see if I can get these people as a sponsor.
[01:47:46.731 --> 01:47:54.353]  Because if you don't buy the videos, at the level we need to expand, I will go get the money somewhere else and then I will take that money.
[01:47:54.553 --> 01:47:56.854]  See a regular corporation would take that money and just keep it.
[01:47:57.964 --> 01:48:00.125]  Not me, because I'm not a corporation either.
[01:48:00.426 --> 01:48:01.706]  I just take it and do more.
[01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:09.772]  The show's about news, about information, but people want to hear shop.
[01:48:09.812 --> 01:48:11.413]  They want to hear what goes on.
[01:48:15.295 --> 01:48:17.296]  So that's basically what it comes down to.
[01:48:17.316 --> 01:48:19.818]  This is the real world.
[01:48:21.079 --> 01:48:22.600]  This is the real world.
[01:48:25.857 --> 01:48:33.083]  We have to have these Federal Reserve notes to be able to continue what we do.
[01:48:34.364 --> 01:48:40.908]  Somebody sent in some cash last week, and I gave my employees a little raise.
[01:48:41.369 --> 01:48:42.630]  I got a big donation.
[01:48:42.670 --> 01:48:43.210]  I said, you know what?
[01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:44.091]  Everybody's getting a raise.
[01:48:44.571 --> 01:48:46.012]  But I said, now the economy gets bad.
[01:48:46.032 --> 01:48:46.733]  I never had to do this.
[01:48:47.013 --> 01:48:48.214]  I'm going to cut how much you're paying.
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:53.806]  If we don't have enough money coming in here, that's what's going to happen.
[01:48:54.186 --> 01:48:55.167]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:48:55.207 --> 01:48:56.389]  This is about education.
[01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:57.991]  You should have storable food.
[01:48:58.011 --> 01:48:59.694]  And I brought you the best company out there we found.
[01:48:59.874 --> 01:49:00.955]  The place where I get my food.
[01:49:01.897 --> 01:49:02.898]  You should have gold.
[01:49:03.522 --> 01:49:06.164]  And I tell you, you should get it, and you better believe the people that own this network.
[01:49:06.585 --> 01:49:09.567]  Ted Anderson has a gold brokerage company, and they've got good deals.
[01:49:10.128 --> 01:49:12.530]  But regardless, gold doubled, folks.
[01:49:13.050 --> 01:49:13.571]  Gold doubled.
[01:49:13.711 --> 01:49:14.311]  It's good advice.
[01:49:14.972 --> 01:49:17.374]  I tell it like it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:17.734 --> 01:49:18.955]  I tell it like it is.
[01:49:19.976 --> 01:49:27.042]  We tell you to try to get a piece of property out in the country if you can, even if it's just a few acres, as a place to get away to if everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[01:49:28.251 --> 01:49:37.779]  But if you're listening on WBCR or KCXL or KLBJ or all these other AM and FM stations that pick us up, please support them as well.
[01:49:39.181 --> 01:49:44.906]  And go to their bookstores or go to their online shops and buy t-shirts or sponsor them.
[01:49:45.426 --> 01:49:48.649]  Because believe me, it takes a lot of money to do what we're doing.
[01:49:49.009 --> 01:49:50.931]  It takes a lot of money to run a radio station too.
[01:49:51.291 --> 01:49:52.392]  So support those affiliates.
[01:49:52.672 --> 01:49:53.253]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:57.211 --> 01:50:02.701]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:03.061 --> 01:50:10.674]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.385 --> 01:50:18.429]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.849 --> 01:50:30.295]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.575 --> 01:50:34.137]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.518 --> 01:50:36.479]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.819 --> 01:50:40.661]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.947 --> 01:51:04.034]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:04.275 --> 01:51:15.504]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.844 --> 01:51:20.668]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:51:20.868 --> 01:51:21.028]  I think?
[01:51:39.531 --> 01:51:41.534]  Elements get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:51:41.574 --> 01:51:42.415]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.

[01:51:58.081 --> 01:51:58.941]  Look no further!
[01:51:59.242 --> 01:52:01.825]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:52:02.245 --> 01:52:10.094]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the new
[01:52:10.094 --> 01:52:10.494]  I think so.
[01:52:28.424 --> 01:52:29.364]  We're good to go.
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:24.421]  Okay, let's take a call.
[01:53:24.521 --> 01:53:26.263]  Mike in New York, you're on the air.
[01:53:28.084 --> 01:53:28.424]  Alex.
[01:53:29.525 --> 01:53:30.105]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:53:30.125 --> 01:53:31.166]  Good to be back.
[01:53:31.206 --> 01:53:35.269]  I want to start squeezing two questions for you, and a solution to all the sheeple listening.
[01:53:36.570 --> 01:53:41.374]  I know you stick to the meat and potatoes of stuff, but did you ever think to step back and look at the bigger picture?
[01:53:41.634 --> 01:53:42.375]  And here's my question.
[01:53:42.395 --> 01:53:43.776]  Did you ever hear of the guy John Lear?
[01:53:45.703 --> 01:53:48.345]  Well, there's a couple questions there, but that does ring a bell.
[01:53:48.785 --> 01:53:53.749]  Oh, you're talking about the fella that is the... He flew for the CIA over 30 years.
[01:53:53.769 --> 01:53:55.250]  He won every medal you could possibly win.
[01:53:55.290 --> 01:53:56.871]  You're talking about the inventor of the Learjet.
[01:53:57.532 --> 01:54:03.476]  His father, Bill, actually invented it, but he, you know, flew for the CIA and he... Sure, I know who it is.
[01:54:03.576 --> 01:54:05.097]  I was just refreshing my memory.
[01:54:05.537 --> 01:54:06.638]  The Lear Disclosure.
[01:54:06.658 --> 01:54:08.639]  Have you ever heard of any of his work?
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.642]  About how they have two NASA programs going on, etc.
[01:54:12.859 --> 01:54:18.906]  Well, there's, of course, I mean, 80 plus percent of NASA missions are classified and secret.
[01:54:19.647 --> 01:54:21.769]  Well, we have the movie which they show us on TV.
[01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:25.033]  We've been flying, he says we've been flying to Mars since the 60s.
[01:54:28.365 --> 01:54:29.245]  Well, look, I don't know.
[01:54:29.606 --> 01:54:30.846]  I mean, I just deal with it.
[01:54:30.886 --> 01:54:33.727]  They're building FEMA camps and you can't get the general public to admit it.
[01:54:34.207 --> 01:54:35.228]  They're trashing the dollar.
[01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:41.470]  They're arrogantly running around poisoning our food and water and admitting it and snickering and giggling and about to attack Iran.
[01:54:41.490 --> 01:54:42.971]  So I'm just trying to deal with what I can prove.
[01:54:43.792 --> 01:54:45.393]  Right, right, right.
[01:54:45.693 --> 01:54:47.594]  It's real easy to step back.
[01:54:47.754 --> 01:54:50.696]  Let me just say something for a minute.
[01:54:50.756 --> 01:54:56.419]  It's real easy to step back and you're going to see chupacabras and Bigfoots and Loch Ness Monsters and everything else.
[01:54:57.079 --> 01:55:00.902]  Now I'm not saying that there isn't a lot of black ops going on, a lot of secret technologies.
[01:55:01.382 --> 01:55:02.202]  There's no doubt.
[01:55:02.582 --> 01:55:05.124]  And a lot of that is in the fields of bioweapons,
[01:55:06.036 --> 01:55:07.557]  It's in the fields of chemical weapons.
[01:55:07.577 --> 01:55:08.798]  It's in the field of nanotech.
[01:55:09.078 --> 01:55:10.719]  That's where the real revolutions are happening.
[01:55:10.979 --> 01:55:12.800]  And yes, there is a secret space program.
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:13.501]  That's admitted.
[01:55:13.541 --> 01:55:15.262]  They just said they won't tell us what it is.
[01:55:15.322 --> 01:55:15.802]  So, go ahead.
[01:55:16.883 --> 01:55:21.506]  Well, of course, you know, he's talking about the aliens and how they exist and all that, but that's a different subject.
[01:55:22.006 --> 01:55:25.788]  Now, second, have you ever heard of the indigo phenomena, how we move towards 2012?
[01:55:27.168 --> 01:55:29.710]  And there's a new Earth consciousness that everybody's waking up.
[01:55:30.110 --> 01:55:31.451]  And that's why... Yeah, I know.
[01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:32.912]  New age is old age.
[01:55:33.012 --> 01:55:34.433]  It's just more mind control.
[01:55:35.214 --> 01:55:38.876]  It's all the federal government's orchestrating engineering, much of that.
[01:55:38.896 --> 01:55:40.437]  Oh, you think so?
[01:55:40.797 --> 01:55:41.418]  No, I don't think.
[01:55:41.498 --> 01:55:42.899]  I absolutely know, yeah.
[01:55:43.439 --> 01:55:52.846]  Well, it's astrological events, you know, because the Earth is heating up, so we're moving towards a new era with the Earth and the stars and, you know... So you're tying the sun
[01:55:53.664 --> 01:55:58.127]  And it's, uh, it's actions in with astrology.
[01:55:58.927 --> 01:56:02.890]  Well, no, well, you could report, you could do the research, it's, we're moving towards a new era.
[01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:07.072]  So you're saying astrology is as real a science as biology?
[01:56:08.153 --> 01:56:10.354]  Of course it's, of course it's real, you don't believe that?
[01:56:12.235 --> 01:56:13.116]  No, I don't believe it.
[01:56:13.136 --> 01:56:14.016]  Absolutely.
[01:56:14.096 --> 01:56:14.417]  Astrology?
[01:56:14.437 --> 01:56:15.137]  You don't believe in that?
[01:56:15.697 --> 01:56:16.138]  No, I don't.
[01:56:16.158 --> 01:56:17.499]  Let me just on record tell you.
[01:56:18.119 --> 01:56:18.899]  Oh, okay.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.381]  Well, uh... Listen, I really appreciate your call, bro.
[01:56:22.808 --> 01:56:42.660]  You see, once you step into that area, once you get into the alternative plan and how they plan to exterminate us and build Mars bases, and once you get into the astrology and all the rest of it, it's over!
[01:56:44.361 --> 01:56:46.442]  I mean, there's no end to what then you're going to believe.
[01:56:46.502 --> 01:56:49.684]  Next, the Reptoids really run things, and Alex is covering that up.
[01:56:50.783 --> 01:56:55.746]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[01:56:59.508 --> 01:57:00.929]  So that's just how it works.
[01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:04.811]  And that's how it's going to continue to work.
[01:57:05.192 --> 01:57:06.813]  When we come back, we're going to play Ron Paul.
[01:57:06.833 --> 01:57:10.655]  We're going to come out of the break and play part of Ron Paul's speech and come back and play the rest of it.
[01:57:11.155 --> 01:57:15.818]  So you're going to start the third hour here and you're going to hear Ron Paul in Iowa.
[01:57:16.972 --> 01:57:18.312]  Being introduced by the snake.
[01:57:18.352 --> 01:57:19.353]  Why don't we just cut her off?
[01:57:19.673 --> 01:57:22.014]  Why even hear Laura Ingraham make fun of Ron Paul?
[01:57:23.414 --> 01:57:27.575]  Why even hear a phony conservative there to neutralize the American people's resistance to their evil?
[01:57:27.996 --> 01:57:29.996]  A piece of filth who says there's no North American Union.
[01:57:30.296 --> 01:57:32.037]  Yeah, don't even play that piece of filth.
[01:57:34.017 --> 01:57:37.919]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.259 --> 01:57:39.039]  Or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:46.614 --> 01:57:53.318]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[01:57:53.338 --> 01:57:59.062]  What a delight, and thank you for that very healthy, energetic welcoming.
[01:57:59.142 --> 01:58:00.002]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:58:05.826 --> 01:58:11.970]  Our campaign is all about freedom, prosperity, and peace!
[01:58:20.419 --> 01:58:24.804]  The one thing we have to remember is you cannot have freedom without life.
[01:58:25.384 --> 01:58:31.651]  We must preserve all life if we expect to protect the individual liberty of each and every one of us.
[01:58:31.971 --> 01:58:34.334]  And that means the unborn as well.
[01:58:40.211 --> 01:58:52.069]  Let me assure you, as an OB doctor and as one that has studied history and economic policy and politics for a long time, I can assure you that life begins at conception.
[01:58:59.258 --> 01:59:04.482]  Life begins at conception, and as an OB doctor, I have the legal responsibility of taking care of that life.
[01:59:04.883 --> 01:59:06.904]  If I did anything wrong, I could be sued.
[01:59:06.944 --> 01:59:09.827]  If anybody's in an accident and the fetus is killed, they can be sued.
[01:59:10.167 --> 01:59:14.030]  If in a violent act, the fetus is killed, you can be charged with murder.
[01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:22.197]  There is no reason in the world that this government can't protect life, rather than the destruction of life, like they do when they finance abortion.
[01:59:22.237 --> 01:59:23.338]  That has to stop.
[01:59:32.228 --> 01:59:38.890]  The most important way that can be stopped is the reversal and the elimination of that horrible ruling.
[01:59:39.211 --> 01:59:41.451]  Roe vs. Wade must be reversed.
[01:59:47.533 --> 01:59:57.337]  I am an advocate, a very strong advocate, of following very strictly the rule of law, the Constitution of the United States.
[02:00:07.682 --> 02:00:18.150]  The Constitution was written very precisely to restrain the power and force of government and to protect the liberties of each and every one of us.
[02:00:23.795 --> 02:00:28.738]  But there are a few very, very important responsibilities of the federal government.
[02:00:29.279 --> 02:00:33.282]  One is to provide for a strong national defense.
[02:00:37.288 --> 02:00:40.429]  Unfortunately, we have allowed our defense to slip.
[02:00:41.029 --> 02:00:44.330]  We are now overreached, and we have been weakened.
[02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:50.991]  We have a terrible problem to deal with, with the threat of terrorism, and we are not handling that well.
[02:00:51.191 --> 02:00:58.213]  There has to be a better understanding of the cause of terrorism, so that we can deal with this serious, serious problem.
[02:00:59.133 --> 02:01:07.458]  I think 9-11, quite frankly, could have been prevented if we had had a lot more respect for the Second Amendment.
[02:01:18.765 --> 02:01:22.107]  Freedom means self-responsibility and self-reliance.
[02:01:22.467 --> 02:01:25.269]  It also means you get to keep the fruits of your labor.
[02:01:26.164 --> 02:01:33.168]  But on 9-11, the responsibility for protecting passengers had been diverted to centralized bureaucratic government.
[02:01:33.248 --> 02:01:42.013]  The government told us that we would be safe, that we weren't allowed to resist hijackers, and there was a prevention for having guns on the airlines.
[02:01:42.053 --> 02:01:46.856]  The airlines weren't even permitted to protect their passengers and their equipment.
[02:01:47.296 --> 02:01:51.720]  So, respect for the First and Second Amendment certainly would go a long way.
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:59.506]  Matter of fact, if you look at every single problem we're facing today, it's because of the lack of respect for the rule of law and the Constitution.
[02:01:59.787 --> 02:02:05.992]  The answers can be found in the return to the rule of law and a strict interpretation of the Constitution.
[02:02:22.101 --> 02:02:24.323]  Liberty means that we have freedom of choice.
[02:02:25.464 --> 02:02:28.107]  The right to life issue is not an issue of freedom of choice.
[02:02:28.127 --> 02:02:29.968]  That is a definition of life.
[02:02:30.429 --> 02:02:34.893]  But as individuals and as families and communities, we should have freedom of choice.
[02:02:35.253 --> 02:02:43.961]  One of the most important choices that we should have, and we're allowing it to slip away, is the freedom of choice to educate our system, our children.
[02:02:47.873 --> 02:02:48.914]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:02:49.234 --> 02:02:52.037]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:02:52.297 --> 02:02:56.461]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:02:56.881 --> 02:02:57.722]  So what do you do?
[02:02:58.023 --> 02:03:02.587]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:03.087 --> 02:03:04.347]  With a little know-how difficult.
[02:03:04.827 --> 02:03:05.728]  Sheltering in place.
[02:03:06.128 --> 02:03:09.868]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[02:03:10.169 --> 02:03:19.530]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:03:48.263 --> 02:03:53.707]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.067 --> 02:04:01.712]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.412 --> 02:04:09.456]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.856 --> 02:04:21.282]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.602 --> 02:04:25.164]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.545 --> 02:04:27.506]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.826 --> 02:04:31.668]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:07.029 --> 02:05:09.731]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[02:05:09.891 --> 02:05:19.857]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[02:05:20.138 --> 02:05:23.840]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:30.384]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[02:05:30.564 --> 02:05:31.605]  Are you ready to go solar?

[02:05:44.931 --> 02:05:51.694]  What we need is a restatement to make sure that homeschoolers and private schools are never attacked by our government.
[02:06:00.307 --> 02:06:01.528]  So where are we today?
[02:06:01.608 --> 02:06:09.112]  How many years ago has it been since the Republican Party stood for getting rid of the Department of Education and getting rid of the Department of Energy?
[02:06:09.212 --> 02:06:10.273]  Where are we on that?
[02:06:17.537 --> 02:06:22.960]  We have allowed our nation to be overtaxed and overregulated and overrun by bureaucrats.
[02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:26.302]  The founders would be ashamed of us for what we're putting up with.
[02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:35.777]  We have a very unfair tax system.
[02:06:35.797 --> 02:06:37.220]  We need a fair tax system.
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:41.268]  That means getting rid of the IRS and repealing the 16th Amendment.
[02:06:50.453 --> 02:06:54.855]  A strong national defense means that we have an understanding of national sovereignty.
[02:06:55.175 --> 02:06:57.897]  That is slipping away from us today.
[02:06:58.197 --> 02:07:06.341]  The neoconservatives have taken over from the traditional conservatives, and they do not have the respect for our national borders that they should.
[02:07:07.101 --> 02:07:10.242]  We do not any longer have national sovereignty.
[02:07:10.282 --> 02:07:19.607]  We have deferred too much to the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO, the NAFTA, and the CAFTA agreements, and they should not be part of our system.
[02:07:28.971 --> 02:07:33.793]  That is one of the reasons why we've been weak on immigration, and we need to reassess that.
[02:07:34.113 --> 02:07:36.794]  We should never reward illegal immigration.
[02:07:36.834 --> 02:07:46.538]  We should revalue this idea, the misinterpretation of the Constitution, that anybody who is just born here is a natural citizen, that needs to be revisited.
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:55.721]  Well, that was Congressman Ron Paul just a day or so ago.
[02:07:56.525 --> 02:08:00.790]  We've got a big fan of Congressman Ron Paul in studio, Bob Dacey, for part two of the discussion.
[02:08:01.171 --> 02:08:02.412]  We started in the middle of last week.
[02:08:02.472 --> 02:08:03.453]  Bob, thanks for coming in.
[02:08:03.694 --> 02:08:05.255]  I appreciate the opportunity to be here, Alex.
[02:08:05.275 --> 02:08:05.896]  Thank you for having me.
[02:08:06.817 --> 02:08:10.842]  Recap what we covered, the meeting you went to last week, the basic facts there.
[02:08:10.862 --> 02:08:12.564]  Now you've been attacked for your report.
[02:08:12.644 --> 02:08:14.106]  There is no suspicion by the nation.
[02:08:15.828 --> 02:08:18.850]  There's supposedly no such thing as a Napa Superhighway.
[02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:19.810]  There's no such thing.
[02:08:19.890 --> 02:08:23.072]  Probably next is George Washington with the sun coming up in the morning.
[02:08:23.252 --> 02:08:23.873]  Go through it for us.
[02:08:24.293 --> 02:08:33.619]  Well, you know, last July, just a few weeks ago, Kelly Taylor and I attended the Texas Transportation Forum at the Hilton here in Austin.
[02:08:34.099 --> 02:08:45.263]  Which was a big how-to forum on how all the various methods to toll the people of Texas in order to build infrastructure and of course to promote the the NAFTA Superhighway.
[02:08:45.963 --> 02:08:48.924]  And it was everybody that was there was a big shot.
[02:08:48.984 --> 02:09:01.629]  You know, bankers, lawyers, architects, designers, builders, highway contractors, everybody that was standing making buck on this thing basically.
[02:09:02.279 --> 02:09:05.582]  And so we had trouble getting in as local media.
[02:09:05.923 --> 02:09:07.985]  I have the local TV show, The Simple Truth.
[02:09:08.025 --> 02:09:08.966]  I've had it for eight years.
[02:09:11.128 --> 02:09:16.353]  We have a pretty big audience here in town because Austin is the cable headquarters of America.
[02:09:16.413 --> 02:09:17.895]  So there was the free speech issue.
[02:09:17.915 --> 02:09:19.817]  The free speech issue we haven't really covered.
[02:09:19.857 --> 02:09:20.958]  I'd like to cover that today.
[02:09:23.944 --> 02:09:38.396]  But the crux of the matter was that they were instructing, they were teaching, they were showing all the different options available to toll existing interstate systems and new systems in order to pay for all this stuff.
[02:09:38.536 --> 02:09:42.598]  And then meanwhile they deny that they're ever even talking about or trying to do this while they are.
[02:09:42.938 --> 02:09:43.799]  It's just like the draft.
[02:09:43.819 --> 02:09:45.199]  They've set back up the draft boards.
[02:09:45.499 --> 02:09:46.440]  The Army's saying they need it.
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:47.680]  They've introduced legislation.
[02:09:48.081 --> 02:09:52.243]  The head of the war, the new wars are, says on NPR they want a new draft.
[02:09:52.643 --> 02:09:55.164]  And then when we complain they go, that doesn't exist, you're crazy.
[02:09:55.604 --> 02:09:58.205]  Well, you know, it's a ball-faced lie.
[02:09:58.245 --> 02:10:00.387]  Like this latest thing, it just occurred.
[02:10:00.467 --> 02:10:03.788]  I mean, you've got it up on Infowars.com as your top story.
[02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:13.253]  The Nation magazine has just released a front-page headline piece written by Christopher Hayes.
[02:10:13.913 --> 02:10:18.856]  He came to Texas several months ago and he interviewed everybody involved in the Trans-Texas Corridor fight.
[02:10:19.398 --> 02:10:19.738]  Yes, we are.
[02:10:36.841 --> 02:10:40.864]  So he puts up a piece, which hasn't even hit the newsstands yet, by the way.
[02:10:40.904 --> 02:10:41.765]  It's just on the internet.
[02:10:42.265 --> 02:10:43.206]  You can't buy it yet.
[02:10:43.246 --> 02:10:45.168]  It's not on the stand.
[02:10:45.188 --> 02:10:49.851]  So we're going to be able to counter-attack this guy before his piece ever hits the newsstands.
[02:10:50.352 --> 02:11:03.302]  So what he basically claims, and it's ludicrous, he claims that the Trans-Texas Corridor is real, but the NAFTA Superhighway is a complete fabrication that we made up.
[02:11:04.655 --> 02:11:12.360]  I'm almost speechless trying to understand how you can study this issue with allegiance of proof.
[02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:24.067]  Well, that's always the problem, is that you're drowned in the proof, and then they just know the general public doesn't even know the basic facts of how the world operates, so they'll believe anything you're told.
[02:11:24.107 --> 02:11:27.190]  Well, basically, his article in The Nation...
[02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:31.773]  I don't even know if this has been posted on InfoWars, because it must have gone up in the last few minutes.
[02:11:32.034 --> 02:11:33.475]  You show up and say, have you seen The Nation?
[02:11:33.775 --> 02:11:34.836]  I'm reading it right now.
[02:11:35.197 --> 02:11:38.279]  And he goes on to attack you, Kelly Taylor, Jerome Corsi.
[02:11:38.539 --> 02:11:39.580]  It just does not exist.
[02:11:39.721 --> 02:11:42.263]  Well, basically what the man does, he sets up the article.
[02:11:42.383 --> 02:11:44.605]  Actually, the first five paragraphs are true.
[02:11:45.045 --> 02:11:48.428]  He sets up this diabolical conspiracy to
[02:11:49.389 --> 02:11:57.195]  Just like the amnesty plan wasn't an amnesty, but they said the bill's secret, just trust us, and then a month and a half ago we got it and it was legalized for 12 years with one visit.
[02:11:57.235 --> 02:12:00.057]  Aggravated felons, that means violent felons, it was in the bill.
[02:12:00.197 --> 02:12:02.519]  It actually said violent felons are allowed to be legalized.
[02:12:19.611 --> 02:12:31.678]  It went on to say that five years of no income tax, you get tax amnesty, something citizens never get, and then they said it doesn't exist on top of it, Bob.
[02:12:31.958 --> 02:12:36.761]  Well, you know, in the modern era we have, you know, what is the definition it is?
[02:12:36.801 --> 02:12:38.362]  The English language has taken a beating.
[02:12:38.999 --> 02:13:07.838]  But for this fellow, Christopher Hayes, to have actually researched everything, and what he claims, basically, is that all the proof, all the gigantic amount of proof that we have that the NAFTA Superhighway is real, that you can go on for days on that, that we are kind of wacko paranoids, and we take all these disparate pieces of information, and lo and behold, we weave them into this NAFTA Superhighway, which doesn't exist!
[02:13:08.579 --> 02:13:15.440]  But did you bring the SPP documents gotten through the FOIA filing that say they want to do it piece by piece by stealth?
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:23.522]  He even mentions the Security and Prosperity Partnership as a low-level, functionary, mid-level, not a big deal.
[02:13:23.722 --> 02:13:29.103]  They're just having a meeting in a few days with troops guarding and armored compounds, 18-mile security perimeters.
[02:13:29.163 --> 02:13:36.304]  And last September they had a meeting up in Banff, Alberta, where they said that they need to build the NAFTA superhighway by stealth
[02:13:36.824 --> 02:13:39.925]  To have the infrastructure in place before they spring the North American Union on us.
[02:13:39.945 --> 02:13:41.805]  To then fund it and have a carbon tax.
[02:13:42.025 --> 02:13:53.147]  So, you know, I mean, obviously the man is guilty of, how should I say, selective reading of... But doesn't he know that's why the Nation Magazine is a joke now?
[02:13:53.487 --> 02:13:58.248]  Doesn't he know that's why mainstream media and fake liberals like his magazine are a complete joke?
[02:13:58.368 --> 02:14:02.049]  He claims, now again, I claim different than what he claims.
[02:14:02.089 --> 02:14:03.209]  He claims that he went
[02:14:03.849 --> 02:14:07.412]  As a freelancer, he wrote this article about the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:14:07.452 --> 02:14:08.232]  He came to Texas.
[02:14:08.392 --> 02:14:10.414]  He was just searching after the truth, Bob.
[02:14:10.574 --> 02:14:15.017]  And he went to the Nation magazine and presented it to them to see if they would take it.
[02:14:15.357 --> 02:14:20.520]  Now, you know, since the man is lying in his teeth about the non-existence of the NAFTA Superhighway, I don't believe him.
[02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:26.504]  The Nation is an online establishment, so-called liberal magazine.
[02:14:26.524 --> 02:14:27.525]  It's been around a long time.
[02:14:28.145 --> 02:14:33.469]  And the publisher, the editor, and the part owner is Katrina
[02:14:34.309 --> 02:14:35.109]  Yes, we are.
[02:14:50.586 --> 02:14:54.148]  Put the clamp on this North American Union NAFTA Superhighway thing.
[02:14:54.188 --> 02:14:55.289]  Of course she's going to publish the article.
[02:14:55.309 --> 02:14:58.150]  You know how much somebody like The Nation buys a story like this for?
[02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:59.171]  I have no idea.
[02:14:59.191 --> 02:14:59.751]  15, 20 grand.
[02:15:00.051 --> 02:15:00.691]  You've got to be kidding me.
[02:15:00.711 --> 02:15:02.852]  So there's big money in putting out a story.
[02:15:02.992 --> 02:15:05.714]  So somebody like me, I put out a truth story.
[02:15:06.114 --> 02:15:06.494]  You get nothing.
[02:15:06.574 --> 02:15:07.235]  I get nothing.
[02:15:07.555 --> 02:15:11.036]  But if I write a big fat lie, then I get a whole bunch of money.
[02:15:11.177 --> 02:15:11.597]  Big money.
[02:15:11.797 --> 02:15:13.178]  Man, you know, there's something wrong with that.
[02:15:13.658 --> 02:15:14.738]  Well, they print the money.
[02:15:14.938 --> 02:15:16.399]  The people running things issue the money.
[02:15:16.839 --> 02:15:17.860]  Bob, that's why they can do it.
[02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:22.003]  Yeah, but the truth doesn't seem to pay very well, Alex, but it makes me feel good.
[02:15:22.024 --> 02:15:24.105]  Well, the mobsters run the money machines, brother.
[02:15:24.406 --> 02:15:40.180]  Well, there's an article that I wrote last night debunking his article, and like I said, I could spend forever doing it, but I came up with two specific things that put the lie to his contention that we're a bunch of conspiracy kooks
[02:15:41.501 --> 02:15:44.804]  And that, you know, we make this stuff up, including Jerome Corsi.
[02:15:45.084 --> 02:15:46.905]  He's a right-wing nationalist wacko.
[02:15:46.965 --> 02:15:56.753]  And Kelly Taylor, she's one of the people in his article who, when you mention her name to other people, their eyes are all, oh no, she must, you know, I picture that.
[02:15:56.773 --> 02:16:00.517]  So they use emotional, like high school psychology, oh she's not cool.
[02:16:00.577 --> 02:16:06.802]  And the evil John Birch Society, they're the ones, one of the chief purveyors of this myth of the NAFTA superhighway.
[02:16:07.723 --> 02:16:12.707]  We have the official state of Texas, official New Mexico, California calling it that.
[02:16:13.487 --> 02:16:14.308]  They're doing it.
[02:16:14.388 --> 02:16:15.169]  They're building it.
[02:16:15.429 --> 02:16:19.413]  You're at the meeting with all the bankers a few weeks ago with them all setting this up, but it doesn't exist.
[02:16:19.473 --> 02:16:23.136]  Yeah, and again, you mentioned it before at the beginning of this show.
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:32.987]  We're talking about, at one of the meetings, them waving around an eventual 700 billion dollars with a B. Hey, listen, listen.
[02:16:33.107 --> 02:16:42.854]  The Chronicle, remember last year, attacked us and said that the editor wrote an article, Louis Black, saying, he said that Cintra is not Spanish shown, that we're liars.
[02:16:43.394 --> 02:16:48.858]  I mean, Cintra publicly is Spanish shown, but I mean, he knows that most of his readers are going to read that and think we're lying.
[02:16:48.918 --> 02:16:51.200]  Well, Hitler said, if you tell a lie big enough, people will believe it.
[02:16:52.264 --> 02:16:58.806]  So anyway, here I've got this guy, and there's two things in my article that I refute him with, although I could spend forever.
[02:16:59.227 --> 02:17:20.434]  One of them is, if you believe, if you expect to believe that the Trans-Texas Corridor is real, which he claims it is, he very well, he documents it pretty well, that the Trans-Texas Corridor is real, and yet the NAFTA Superhighway is total fiction, then you would have to believe that the Trans-Texas Corridor is a highway to nowhere.
[02:17:21.002 --> 02:17:22.442]  Doesn't go north of the Red River.
[02:17:22.743 --> 02:17:23.583]  Doesn't go south of the Rio Grande.
[02:17:23.603 --> 02:17:24.143]  Well, let's just stop.
[02:17:24.163 --> 02:17:25.463]  I mean, I haven't read your whole article yet.
[02:17:25.503 --> 02:17:25.984]  It's pretty short.
[02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:31.625]  Why don't you do a part two with all the official Text Dot documents and SPP documents saying it?
[02:17:31.645 --> 02:17:32.806]  Why not just show the documents?
[02:17:33.166 --> 02:17:35.186]  Well, I've got one document already up, I think.
[02:17:35.206 --> 02:17:37.027]  I don't know if it's up yet, but I got one for you.
[02:17:37.187 --> 02:17:37.627]  Okay, good.
[02:17:47.125 --> 02:17:51.628]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:51.968 --> 02:17:56.070]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.350 --> 02:17:56.911]  We listened.
[02:17:57.211 --> 02:18:02.194]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.474 --> 02:18:02.954]  We listened.
[02:18:03.335 --> 02:18:06.376]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:06.797 --> 02:18:07.317]  We listened.
[02:18:07.777 --> 02:18:11.860]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:12.721]  We listened.
[02:18:13.061 --> 02:18:18.305]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:18.725 --> 02:18:20.086]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:20.446 --> 02:18:22.028]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:18:22.208 --> 02:18:27.772]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:18:28.212 --> 02:18:30.854]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[02:18:31.054 --> 02:18:31.254]  Only $279.
[02:18:31.314 --> 02:18:31.895]  Call New Millennium 888-03-4438.
[02:18:31.935 --> 02:18:32.235]  That's 888-03-4438.

[02:18:44.238 --> 02:18:44.678]  Gold.
[02:18:45.019 --> 02:18:46.320]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:52.664]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:52.844 --> 02:18:56.667]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:57.028 --> 02:18:58.909]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:58.949 --> 02:19:01.251]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:01.391 --> 02:19:08.176]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[02:19:08.476 --> 02:19:09.376]  We're good to go.
[02:19:23.541 --> 02:19:23.761]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.415 --> 02:19:47.398]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.438 --> 02:19:52.301]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[02:19:52.462 --> 02:19:58.747]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[02:20:00.308 --> 02:20:02.550]  38% higher than Bill Clinton's highest budget.
[02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:12.238]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:45.009 --> 02:20:47.051]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[02:20:47.692 --> 02:20:56.602]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[02:20:57.043 --> 02:21:04.271]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[02:21:04.975 --> 02:21:10.461]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[02:21:10.961 --> 02:21:21.792]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[02:21:22.553 --> 02:21:24.555]  Laser technology at its best.
[02:21:25.095 --> 02:21:27.296]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the
[02:21:53.012 --> 02:21:54.873]  There's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:55.213 --> 02:21:59.415]  It's a short and sweet article up on Infowars.com.
[02:21:59.475 --> 02:22:01.636]  Bob, I appreciate you bringing us this big story.
[02:22:02.517 --> 02:22:04.898]  We were covering it last week and now the nation's attacked.
[02:22:05.458 --> 02:22:09.020]  I'm going to get Paul Watson and Steve Watson to go through all the course he's worked.
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:12.642]  But I've been doing a year of research on this, I mean intensely.
[02:22:13.522 --> 02:22:16.404]  I read repeatedly all of the four-year
[02:22:17.802 --> 02:22:24.527]  We're going to use the roads to tax, and then we're going to build roads in Mexico to bring in more goods.
[02:22:24.547 --> 02:22:24.847]  83 roads.
[02:22:24.867 --> 02:22:26.269]  They're denying there's one, I-35.
[02:22:41.956 --> 02:22:47.843]  I mean, I was here in Texas 10 years ago when it was on the news, how they're building the big NAFTA highway, when they passed NAFTA.
[02:22:48.203 --> 02:22:53.149]  I mean, Bob, this is like denying the Gulf of Mexico exists.
[02:22:53.209 --> 02:22:55.892]  I mean, this guy, what was this little rat like?
[02:22:56.372 --> 02:22:57.173]  Well, the guy was the
[02:22:57.333 --> 02:23:00.096]  Very, very nice, very young, very nice guy.
[02:23:00.116 --> 02:23:03.058]  He's a very, very attentive, very, very intelligent guy.
[02:23:03.078 --> 02:23:03.799]  They're all like that.
[02:23:04.519 --> 02:23:09.564]  But the thing is, again, he says that he was freelancing and he presented this thing to the nation.
[02:23:09.604 --> 02:23:09.844]  Sure.
[02:23:09.864 --> 02:23:19.693]  I mean, since the guy was so intelligent, there's no way that this guy, after what Kelly and I gave him, could possibly think that we would... No, no, no, no, no.
[02:23:20.833 --> 02:23:30.638]  Well, you know, but the guy was really nice and everything.
[02:23:30.858 --> 02:23:34.460]  The bottom line is, you can't believe somebody who tells a bold-faced lie like that.
[02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:40.623]  I mean, therefore, he can claim that he was freelancing and they accepted his article.
[02:23:41.244 --> 02:23:42.964]  I cannot believe that because he's a liar.
[02:23:43.085 --> 02:23:43.725]  The guy's a liar.
[02:23:44.245 --> 02:23:44.885]  He lied.
[02:23:44.905 --> 02:23:48.386]  He lies about the fact that the knife to Superhighway doesn't exist.
[02:23:48.686 --> 02:23:55.509]  I have another thing in my article, which again, I just whipped this together because I found out about this last night.
[02:23:55.529 --> 02:23:57.689]  I think it's going to be up on Infowars.
[02:23:58.269 --> 02:23:59.350]  You guys scanned it a minute ago.
[02:23:59.370 --> 02:24:00.010]  I have a letter.
[02:24:00.769 --> 02:24:16.987]  uh... that uh... from congressman michael mccall address to kelly taylor in response to a letter that she wrote him about her concerns about the nafta superhighway and the north american union and that letter that was dated november twentieth two thousand six address to kelly
[02:24:17.607 --> 02:24:27.294]  And Michael McCaul, now nobody can accuse Michael McCaul of being a tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist.
[02:24:27.494 --> 02:24:32.758]  He's not a conspiracy theorist, he's not a wacko, he's like main, mainstream Republican.
[02:24:33.759 --> 02:24:34.780]  This is his words.
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:43.606]  This is an issue of great importance to me because the Trans-Texas Corridor is intended to be the first part of the NAFTA Highway.
[02:24:45.149 --> 02:24:45.889]  There you have it again.
[02:24:46.270 --> 02:24:49.291]  Well, Bob, let's just stop here, because I tend to do this too, what you're doing right now.
[02:24:49.311 --> 02:24:51.432]  We tend to even almost give credence to their lies.
[02:24:51.812 --> 02:24:54.273]  They lie about everything incessantly.
[02:24:54.814 --> 02:24:57.735]  They're still saying the amnesty plan wasn't an amnesty.
[02:24:58.635 --> 02:25:03.978]  I mean, they said that they never planned to be in Iraq more than six months, when the official Pentagon plan said decades.
[02:25:05.045 --> 02:25:10.369]  I don't know what we even expect here, but I do think this lie should be illustrated to the public about how they are running so scared
[02:25:24.564 --> 02:25:31.610]  I mean, how many TxDOT documents, how many Federal Department of Transportation documents do we have where they call it the NAFTA Highway System?
[02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:35.673]  I mean, they don't just call it the one highway, it's 83 of them!
[02:25:35.853 --> 02:25:36.954]  Yeah, it's all over the place.
[02:25:36.994 --> 02:25:52.467]  I remember in 2004, Mike Kruse, you know, published a report to his superiors at the state legislature, a big long report, where he's sitting there saying, boy, we are shifting, the federal government is shifting all their priorities to the north-south corridors, and we need to get on the bandwagon.
[02:25:52.487 --> 02:25:53.348]  I mean, it's...
[02:25:54.722 --> 02:25:55.663]  I don't know.
[02:25:55.843 --> 02:25:56.863]  It's preposterous.
[02:25:57.263 --> 02:25:58.704]  But it's a military tactic.
[02:25:59.264 --> 02:26:00.945]  That's why tanks have camouflage on them.
[02:26:01.305 --> 02:26:03.046]  If it's in the desert, they're brown or tan.
[02:26:03.086 --> 02:26:06.168]  And if it's in the jungle, they've got camo painted on them.
[02:26:06.428 --> 02:26:08.449]  This isn't the military.
[02:26:08.709 --> 02:26:10.870]  This is why you crawl up on the enemy.
[02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:12.151]  And they just keep denying.
[02:26:12.191 --> 02:26:13.071]  No, there's no assault.
[02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:20.815]  But if you actually read the guy's article, because it is such a monstrous lie, if you actually read the article, he is actually
[02:26:21.889 --> 02:26:26.392]  He's admitting that there's a NAFTA superhighway, while he's denying it at the same time.
[02:26:26.772 --> 02:26:32.916]  He lists many of the indisputable facts, like for example, the port of Lazaro Cardenas.
[02:26:33.297 --> 02:26:50.008]  I mean, he mentions it, that yeah, that's true, they are going to be expanding this thing humongously, but he thinks that if you connect massive Chinese communist slave goods pouring into Lazaro Cardenas, with the necessity of building more infrastructure in Mexico to get it north,
[02:26:50.989 --> 02:26:52.910]  He won't put that together.
[02:26:52.930 --> 02:26:54.450]  He thinks that we're making that up.
[02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:57.451]  What do they expect the Chinese Communist slave goods to do?
[02:26:57.471 --> 02:27:01.493]  Just pile up on the southwestern coast of Mexico forever and ever and ever?
[02:27:01.713 --> 02:27:01.873]  Well, no.
[02:27:01.953 --> 02:27:02.913]  You weren't here last week.
[02:27:02.973 --> 02:27:07.115]  They expect us to have twice the traffic of the Houston port.
[02:27:07.475 --> 02:27:09.455]  It's going to be bigger than the Houston port.
[02:27:09.535 --> 02:27:11.456]  That's what the capacity is designed to be.
[02:27:12.096 --> 02:27:14.177]  2.2 TEUs, which is huge!
[02:27:14.277 --> 02:27:17.637]  And you said it in the Houston's 1.1, so that's... Houston's 1.6.
[02:27:17.857 --> 02:27:19.058]  Okay, so it's almost double.
[02:27:19.198 --> 02:27:19.378]  Yeah.
[02:27:19.558 --> 02:27:21.658]  So, come on, you know, what are they gonna do?
[02:27:21.698 --> 02:27:22.878]  The Chinese are gonna get real mad.
[02:27:24.379 --> 02:27:25.359]  No place that's in there free.
[02:27:26.239 --> 02:27:32.981]  But I mean, it's almost like when we respond to them on their level and even argue it, it's almost like a... It's just a military tactic, folks.
[02:27:35.761 --> 02:27:36.942]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.162 --> 02:27:38.642]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:42.344]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.618 --> 02:27:49.721]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[02:27:49.981 --> 02:27:55.065]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[02:27:55.345 --> 02:27:59.989]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[02:28:00.329 --> 02:28:02.311]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[02:28:02.611 --> 02:28:08.455]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:28:08.815 --> 02:28:09.536]  And it works.
[02:28:10.023 --> 02:28:11.485]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[02:28:11.865 --> 02:28:12.866]  Now it's your turn.
[02:28:13.147 --> 02:28:15.490]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:19.935]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[02:28:20.215 --> 02:28:23.319]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[02:28:23.712 --> 02:28:25.914]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[02:28:26.094 --> 02:28:28.436]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:28:28.456 --> 02:28:28.696]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:28:28.716 --> 02:28:30.338]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:28:30.358 --> 02:28:30.878]  Guaranteed!
[02:28:30.898 --> 02:28:31.138]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:28:31.158 --> 02:28:31.479]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:28:31.499 --> 02:28:32.019]  Morning, neighbor!
[02:28:32.039 --> 02:28:32.139]  Hey!
[02:28:32.159 --> 02:28:33.000]  Shouldn't you be at work?
[02:28:49.272 --> 02:28:49.592]  I am.
[02:28:49.852 --> 02:28:51.853]  As a matter of fact, I pulled another all-nighter.
[02:28:52.073 --> 02:28:52.713]  What do you mean?
[02:28:53.234 --> 02:28:55.795]  I'm working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[02:28:56.055 --> 02:28:58.196]  Well, at least I'm making money 24-7.
[02:28:58.336 --> 02:28:59.476]  But I never have to go to work.
[02:28:59.796 --> 02:29:00.717]  So, what do you do?
[02:29:01.017 --> 02:29:02.117]  Not very much at all now.
[02:29:02.398 --> 02:29:04.238]  About a month ago, I heard about this website.
[02:29:04.258 --> 02:29:05.119]  It's got a funny name.
[02:29:05.159 --> 02:29:07.480]  It's DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:09.221]  That is funny.
[02:29:09.241 --> 02:29:14.106]  Yeah, you can earn $1,200 to $12,000 a week starting the very first week.
[02:29:14.646 --> 02:29:16.708]  Oh, is that how you bought that new mower?
[02:29:16.888 --> 02:29:19.611]  Yeah, and the motorcycle I've always wanted, too.
[02:29:19.811 --> 02:29:20.472]  You should log on.
[02:29:20.632 --> 02:29:22.494]  Find out how you can become financially free.
[02:29:22.674 --> 02:29:24.135]  So what was that website?
[02:29:24.235 --> 02:29:31.202]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com Just wait, I'll go get a pen so I can write that down.
[02:29:31.562 --> 02:29:32.603]  You don't need to write it down.
[02:29:32.663 --> 02:29:33.523]  It's easy to remember.
[02:29:33.783 --> 02:29:37.145]  DidYouRobBillGates.com Yeah!
[02:29:37.485 --> 02:29:41.126]  DidYouRobBillGates.com That is easy!
[02:29:41.447 --> 02:29:44.128]  It's easy and the money is awesome!
[02:29:46.769 --> 02:29:51.211]  Babies spend up to 15 hours a day sleeping and playing on a crib mattress.
[02:29:51.792 --> 02:29:56.174]  Standard baby mattresses are suspected of containing potentially harmful chemicals.
[02:29:56.714 --> 02:30:03.238]  The primary ingredient in most mattresses is polyurethane foam, a highly flammable petroleum product.
[02:30:03.638 --> 02:30:08.020]  At Naturepedic, we believe that your baby's health and safety are not negotiable.
[02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:13.383]  An organic cotton mattress is the first step toward a healthy and natural crib environment.
[02:30:13.664 --> 02:30:24.011]  At Naturepedic, the no-compromise organic baby crib mattress features organic cotton filling and a waterproof surface so pure that it meets food contact standards.
[02:30:24.451 --> 02:30:30.595]  A Naturepedic mattress provides a healthy sleep environment for your baby and a peace of mind for you.

[02:30:39.761 --> 02:30:49.865]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade
[02:31:08.607 --> 02:31:13.371]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[02:31:14.372 --> 02:31:21.658]  The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five, but I am still alive.
[02:31:21.678 --> 02:31:29.204]  I was a sailor, I was born on the wrong side.
[02:31:29.224 --> 02:31:30.485]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:31:30.545 --> 02:31:32.247]  Glad you've joined us.
[02:31:32.487 --> 02:31:34.268]  Bob Dacey with a lot of other key information.
[02:31:35.755 --> 02:31:38.216]  Coming up in just a moment.
[02:31:41.537 --> 02:31:45.239]  I wanted to take some time out to tell you about some special deals over at Interfood.
[02:31:45.279 --> 02:31:49.440]  The highest quality green food system I found out there.
[02:31:49.980 --> 02:31:52.521]  You take a lot of vitamins and things you don't really absorb them all.
[02:31:52.581 --> 02:31:53.482]  With this you do.
[02:31:54.642 --> 02:31:55.863]  Just so many different ingredients.
[02:31:55.963 --> 02:31:58.183]  Fruits, vegetables, the extracts, herbs.
[02:31:59.384 --> 02:32:01.565]  And they're Patriots and it's inexpensive.
[02:32:01.625 --> 02:32:04.786]  But they've been telling me about this and I haven't even really plugged this for you.

[02:32:17.668 --> 02:32:19.728]  I wondered why when I clicked on that banner it was a picture of me.
[02:32:19.788 --> 02:32:22.989]  I guess I didn't take time to read it.
[02:32:24.349 --> 02:32:31.311]  But that means you get 10% off right there when you go through the PrisonPlanet.com banner.

[02:32:39.899 --> 02:32:40.540]  Another 10% if you get the 311.

[02:33:15.013 --> 02:33:18.554]  This is not junky MSG filled MREs.
[02:33:18.574 --> 02:33:21.876]  This is high quality, clean, organic food.
[02:33:22.937 --> 02:33:26.738]  This is, in his words, 99% of what they have is organic.
[02:33:26.758 --> 02:33:28.198]  Some of it they can't completely certify.
[02:33:28.258 --> 02:33:29.898]  He said, call it clean food.
[02:33:30.259 --> 02:33:32.039]  This is what I have for my family.
[02:33:32.419 --> 02:33:33.419]  It's an insurance policy.
[02:33:33.919 --> 02:33:35.220]  It's an insurance policy you can eat.
[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:35.880]  It lasts for 10 years.
[02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:39.580]  You've got a bunch of different packages from 2 month supplies to 3 year supplies.
[02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:40.761]  Give them a call.
[02:33:40.861 --> 02:33:41.321]  Learn more.

[02:33:42.241 --> 02:33:42.301]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:47.982 --> 02:33:52.945]  Or eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, there's also a banner there at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:53.545 --> 02:34:08.834]  Bob Dacey, I was, during the break I was reading this piece of, how am I going to call these names, this Creature's News, from the Nation Magazine, and he tries to make all the local Texans fighting this sound like nuts.
[02:34:09.615 --> 02:34:11.316]  Now, listen to how he writes this.
[02:34:12.862 --> 02:34:23.591]  Hall soon became part of the broader anti-TTC effort, and though she originally thought she was just fighting corrupt local government, she's come to view her battle in a much broader context.
[02:34:23.931 --> 02:34:26.073]  They're a big-time control issue, she said.
[02:34:26.453 --> 02:34:30.636]  Someone is really jockeying around to control some things here in America.
[02:34:31.657 --> 02:34:32.238]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:34:32.678 --> 02:34:36.721]  We have over a hundred million spent in the last six, seven years here lobbying in Texas alone.
[02:34:37.061 --> 02:34:38.202]  It's foreign companies doing it.
[02:34:38.222 --> 02:34:40.264]  They're grabbing existing roads and putting toll roads on them.
[02:34:40.856 --> 02:34:43.517]  But notice how he picks the quote of someone.
[02:34:43.557 --> 02:34:52.923]  Oh, like we believe that there are Loch Ness monsters or Grendel sneaking around in the bushes with chupacabra coachmen.
[02:34:54.183 --> 02:34:58.946]  It explains the open borders, it explains our migration issues, it explains the free trade issues.
[02:34:59.946 --> 02:35:01.507]  What is new in the middle class?
[02:35:02.308 --> 02:35:04.469]  It really all started with NAFTA, she continued.
[02:35:04.749 --> 02:35:10.252]  There's been people like Robert Pastor and the Council on Foreign Relations, all these secretive groups, she laughed nervously
[02:35:11.099 --> 02:35:12.299]  And apologetically.
[02:35:12.339 --> 02:35:16.180]  See, we're sorry, we don't have the initiative, we're kooks.
[02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:25.082]  See, this is meant for upper-class liberals to read and think, ooh, you're kooky and you're quaint, like a bunch of Texas hillbillies.
[02:35:25.462 --> 02:35:26.722]  This is all out of context.
[02:35:27.342 --> 02:35:32.783]  Do they tell you here that the main head, editor, and owner, and that it's all CFR at The Nation?
[02:35:33.824 --> 02:35:35.284]  Do they tell you any of this?
[02:35:35.304 --> 02:35:35.344]  No.
[02:35:37.998 --> 02:35:41.841]  And so it just goes into how we're a bunch of schizophrenic nut jobs.
[02:35:42.742 --> 02:35:51.529]  But then again, a couple weeks ago, you're at the big TTC meeting, and there they are with the foreign bank saying, we got $700 bill for you, if you just hand over the infrastructure.
[02:35:52.049 --> 02:36:01.717]  Well, you know, I will guarantee you, Alex, because I was at this interview with Mr. Christopher Hayes, I will guarantee you, I didn't spit into a spittoon even once while we were talking to that fella.
[02:36:01.957 --> 02:36:03.959]  That's good, because I wasn't there that time.
[02:36:03.979 --> 02:36:07.022]  I didn't pick my nose, I didn't scratch any place, you know.
[02:36:08.363 --> 02:36:11.304]  I have a, you know, I can be, I can be, I don't have to be a good old boy.
[02:36:11.324 --> 02:36:12.664]  You're very genteel.
[02:36:12.765 --> 02:36:25.148]  I'm very genteel, and Kelly Taylor is the epitome of genteel, and yet, you know, according to his article, you know, you mentioned her name, and oh boy, there goes the eyeballs.
[02:36:25.329 --> 02:36:26.109]  Oh, not her.
[02:36:26.529 --> 02:36:35.652]  You know, when frankly, Kelly's extremely subdued and way too conservative about all her, I mean, you want to get down to brass tacks, she's very careful about everything,
[02:36:36.453 --> 02:36:47.068]  Now, look, all of this aside, again, this is meant for wannabe, know-it-all power liberals, who are little professors and things, who sit around and not have any anxiety about what's happening.
[02:36:47.088 --> 02:36:50.673]  But here's the problem, and I would add this to the next article you do, and Paul Watson does one as well.
[02:36:52.148 --> 02:37:09.272]  Last year, we had on the radio, and then we interviewed him in person, a video when he came here to the book fair last year, Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist for the World Bank, Nobel Prize winner, saying, yes, just like the third world, how they seize infrastructure and buy the politicians off to get it, that's now happening here.
[02:37:09.672 --> 02:37:14.693]  So let me see, the Nobel Prize winner, I guess people roll their eyes about him too, Bob?
[02:37:14.973 --> 02:37:15.373]  Why not?
[02:37:15.413 --> 02:37:20.454]  I mean, you know, I guess he's a tinfoil hat wearing kook like the rest of us, I guess.
[02:37:21.118 --> 02:37:24.501]  You know, locally here, and I want to plug this before I get up.
[02:37:24.561 --> 02:37:25.862]  We've got a big meeting tonight.
[02:37:26.042 --> 02:37:30.065]  There's a big meeting tonight in the Austin area having to do with the Campo Board.
[02:37:30.105 --> 02:37:32.767]  That's the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization.
[02:37:33.147 --> 02:37:37.030]  They're the ones who keep trying to slap tolls on existing roads in the Austin area.
[02:37:37.251 --> 02:37:38.411]  And then saying it doesn't exist.
[02:37:38.792 --> 02:37:42.895]  And their official map says they're going to do it on Mopac, but then when you complain they say it doesn't exist.
[02:37:43.195 --> 02:37:45.577]  Well, actually, that does exist on Mopac.
[02:37:46.017 --> 02:37:47.418]  We can prove that big time.
[02:37:47.438 --> 02:37:48.739]  Well, they've announced it.
[02:37:48.759 --> 02:37:52.062]  We're going to have... It's not a toll road, it's a managed lane on Mopac.
[02:37:52.242 --> 02:37:55.104]  It's a variable toll, so therefore it's not a toll.
[02:37:55.385 --> 02:37:56.085]  Got that, Alex?
[02:37:56.145 --> 02:37:58.767]  But remember, they said no, no, nothing would be on it two years ago.
[02:37:58.847 --> 02:38:05.052]  We had their map saying it, but... Well, no, we keep saying no, we don't want the tolls on existing roads, and they say, yes, you do.
[02:38:05.112 --> 02:38:05.713]  We keep saying no.
[02:38:05.953 --> 02:38:08.455]  Anyway, there's a meeting tonight... Then they say, no, it doesn't exist.
[02:38:09.595 --> 02:38:10.756]  At 545 p.m.
[02:38:10.796 --> 02:38:15.218]  at the Joe C. Thompson Conference Center at the University of Texas campus.
[02:38:16.019 --> 02:38:17.420]  That's room 2.102.
[02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:21.021]  And 545 is where this CAMPO board meeting follows.
[02:38:21.582 --> 02:38:25.544]  And they suggest you wear yellow as a caution, as a sign of caution.
[02:38:25.584 --> 02:38:28.745]  If you go there, if you're in the Austin area, go down there and show them.
[02:38:28.785 --> 02:38:29.726]  We're not going away.
[02:38:29.966 --> 02:38:32.308]  You know, we're not going to... Are they saying we're yellow, or are we sure?
[02:38:32.388 --> 02:38:37.633]  No, we... our people are saying that we're yellow to show them that, you know, this is a sign of caution.
[02:38:37.713 --> 02:38:40.095]  I don't know what that means, but that's what it says here in this little release.
[02:38:40.635 --> 02:38:52.986]  But, you know, they're going to talk about it some more, and again, the bottom line is, they don't care what you think, and we need to show them that, yeah, you better care what we think, because your political hide is on the line, bucko!
[02:38:53.587 --> 02:38:55.869]  You know, we've got to keep showing them that we're not going away.
[02:38:56.912 --> 02:38:59.277]  As they continue to try to tow our roads we've already paid for.
[02:38:59.317 --> 02:39:02.644]  Bob, getting back to the psychology though, of this congenital lying.
[02:39:03.823 --> 02:39:08.385]  When they started this a few years ago, before they would lie some, but mainly spin and twist.
[02:39:08.445 --> 02:39:09.626]  Now they're just outright lying.
[02:39:09.986 --> 02:39:18.690]  And I don't know why government and even mainline media, when they got caught lying, instead of trying to at least act a little more credible, have just gotten ten times worse now.
[02:39:19.411 --> 02:39:22.172]  I mean, they'll deny just everything.
[02:39:22.813 --> 02:39:28.795]  It's like Gonzales saying, we're not spying domestically and Bush saying, and then they get caught and they say, okay, we're allowed to.
[02:39:30.096 --> 02:39:31.197]  I mean, they are just...
[02:39:32.417 --> 02:39:34.958]  I mean, do you want to comment just on the level of lying?
[02:39:35.078 --> 02:39:39.020]  I think they've been watching too much Saturday Night Live reruns with Jon Lovitz, you know?
[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:45.882]  You know, that guy, he was always talking about, yeah, so and there, everything, I'm gonna lie, everything, yeah, that's right, yeah, that's the ticket.
[02:39:46.163 --> 02:39:54.186]  I mean, they just lie all the time, and I think that they just plain flat, they lie so much that I think they forget that they're lying.
[02:39:55.226 --> 02:39:57.768]  When you do that all the time, it becomes normal.
[02:39:57.788 --> 02:40:01.390]  But it's also a psychological tactic, because it's almost like they refuse to fight with us.
[02:40:01.731 --> 02:40:02.651]  You come and say, don't do this!
[02:40:02.671 --> 02:40:04.192]  And they just go, does it exist?
[02:40:04.393 --> 02:40:06.094]  While the bulldozers are behind them, milking it.
[02:40:06.394 --> 02:40:08.876]  And you go, but it does, here's your own documents.
[02:40:09.196 --> 02:40:10.337]  No, you're insane!
[02:40:10.357 --> 02:40:13.999]  I have articles here today, mainstream news, about Putin right now.
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:22.065]  All these prominent people that are protesting him, they just, the police come pick you up, they shoot you up with drugs for six months, and they release you as a brain-dead zombie.
[02:40:24.295 --> 02:40:25.456]  They just say you're mentally ill.
[02:40:25.516 --> 02:40:28.437]  It's got the description of them strapped down on gurneys being injected.
[02:40:29.137 --> 02:40:30.138]  And the same thing in China.
[02:40:30.178 --> 02:40:34.700]  You protest, they just shoot you up with something that paralyzes you, and you're paralyzed and they let you go to die.
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:37.501]  I mean, pretty soon it's just, oh, you're just mentally ill.
[02:40:37.521 --> 02:40:38.221]  None of it exists.
[02:40:38.721 --> 02:40:41.663]  Well, you know, we are making progress against these people, Alex.
[02:40:41.723 --> 02:40:42.883]  It's not all negative at all.
[02:40:42.903 --> 02:40:43.984]  No, no, we're making a lot of progress.
[02:40:44.004 --> 02:40:45.084]  We're making tremendous progress.
[02:40:45.104 --> 02:40:46.965]  We're making a lot of progress, but my point is, is that
[02:40:48.013 --> 02:40:50.055]  Still, a lot of people are taken back by the lying.
[02:40:50.315 --> 02:40:52.476]  Here's an example.
[02:40:52.516 --> 02:40:53.897]  I've got a friend doing graphics for us.
[02:40:53.937 --> 02:40:57.460]  His mother woke up at the Trans-Texas Corridor, North American Union.
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:02.323]  She's going to go up to Canada to just watch this big meeting on the 20th and 22nd.
[02:41:03.604 --> 02:41:05.926]  She called her Sunday and said, Are you sure it's real?
[02:41:05.946 --> 02:41:07.287]  Because they're saying it isn't real.
[02:41:07.927 --> 02:41:11.030]  See, for a minute she was a mainline conservative starting to wake up.
[02:41:12.128 --> 02:41:13.130]  Maybe it's not real.
[02:41:13.290 --> 02:41:14.693]  Maybe George Bush is good, Bob.
[02:41:14.913 --> 02:41:18.460]  Well, the Easter eggs are real, but the Easter bunny is not.
[02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:19.241]  You got that?
[02:41:19.702 --> 02:41:21.145]  To use one of your comparisons.
[02:41:21.646 --> 02:41:23.449]  Easter egg's real, Easter bunny not.
[02:41:23.589 --> 02:41:23.950]  Got that?
[02:41:24.865 --> 02:41:25.626]  That's the way it works.
[02:41:25.706 --> 02:41:27.086]  Sometimes I feel like the Easter Bunny.
[02:41:27.186 --> 02:41:41.874]  You know, back to this thing I was plugging here at the Josie Thompson Conference Center tonight in Austin, you can also go to that Texas Toll Party website and you can just write an email to a whole bunch of these people that are planning on doing this and let them know what you think.
[02:41:41.894 --> 02:41:43.255]  You don't have to be from Austin to do that.
[02:41:43.275 --> 02:41:50.039]  You can be from anywhere in the world and go to TexasTollParty.com and write them a note, a nice polite note, about what you think about all this.
[02:41:50.239 --> 02:41:52.520]  Now by the way, this is the big First Amendment issue.
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:42:10.050]  You went to this big meeting with all these top bankers and people, and you and Kelly Taylor did, for the simple truth in the American Magazine, and you're there, and they're openly saying, they're wise to us, and there's a big public discussion, big big discussions about how to pitch this in front of all the mainline media who know not to go report on it.
[02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:17.834]  Well actually, you know, Alex, if the mainline media was there, one of the main ways that they lie is just to not report on anything.
[02:42:18.354 --> 02:42:42.988]  Now, the American statesman, if they were there, they must have been hiding behind a curtain somewhere, because the local Austin paper, in their own town, where the bankers are waving 700 billion dollars around, and where TxDOT is saying, hey, we want to buy back the highways from the Fed so we can slap tolls on them, that is not newsworthy to the American statesman, because they didn't print
[02:42:43.738 --> 02:42:46.199]  A word, Alex, not a word.
[02:42:46.239 --> 02:42:51.981]  Now, there's a classic example of lying by omission, and by the way, that brings me up to my other topic here.
[02:42:52.641 --> 02:42:59.584]  Here we have the mainstream media who is authorized by tech stock to come cover their event.
[02:43:00.024 --> 02:43:01.245]  They're approved.
[02:43:02.145 --> 02:43:02.985]  They don't even show up.
[02:43:03.005 --> 02:43:04.586]  But you're not approved.
[02:43:04.606 --> 02:43:12.149]  But we, Local Simple Truth TV, as local TV reporters for our cable access show, we are not approved.
[02:43:12.882 --> 02:43:21.046]  Because, well, you see, we don't get paid for what we do, and we don't have an editor who can put a thumb on us if something we say leaks out.
[02:43:21.106 --> 02:43:23.087]  Or pay a $20,000 for a Lion Hit piece.
[02:43:23.187 --> 02:43:26.389]  Yeah, so what I did was, again, we got in as New Americans.
[02:43:26.409 --> 02:43:28.830]  We kind of went up the ladder.
[02:43:29.931 --> 02:43:30.551]  I've looked into it.
[02:43:30.571 --> 02:43:32.492]  A cover story in the nation of this is a cover story.
[02:43:32.752 --> 02:43:33.352]  It's probably got $15,000, $20,000.
[02:43:34.453 --> 02:43:36.434]  Well, yeah, wow, do you?
[02:43:36.634 --> 02:43:37.254]  That's how it works.
[02:43:37.294 --> 02:43:38.075]  I wish I could get $15,000, $20,000.
[02:43:38.155 --> 02:43:40.036]  It's just tough luck, you know?
[02:43:40.556 --> 02:43:41.878]  Well, you don't own the printing presses.
[02:43:42.058 --> 02:43:49.645]  Well, anyway, what I did was, you know, we tried to apply to get into this thing as Simple Truth TV, and they said, no, you don't qualify.
[02:43:49.785 --> 02:43:51.787]  There's an article up on your website about it.
[02:43:52.007 --> 02:43:55.451]  They said we don't qualify, so we said, okay, well, we'll try as New American.
[02:43:55.651 --> 02:43:56.672]  Well, they didn't qualify either.
[02:43:57.132 --> 02:44:02.537]  I mean, this is a state agency, Alex, a state agency of the government of Texas.
[02:44:02.617 --> 02:44:03.998]  It's now saying they decide what the media is.
[02:44:04.018 --> 02:44:05.519]  It's saying they decide what the media is.
[02:44:05.599 --> 02:44:12.525]  It's like they decide if a church is authorized, they decide if a demonstration, they decide if you're allowed to have a gun, they decide if you can have a car, they decide if you can have your children.
[02:44:12.845 --> 02:44:14.626]  I mean, I want to shift gears.
[02:44:15.407 --> 02:44:19.273]  As you know, last week you didn't finish your big list of things that went on inside the meeting.
[02:44:19.533 --> 02:44:24.100]  In the time we've got left, Bob, run through what else happened at this big text.meeting with the bankers.
[02:44:24.401 --> 02:44:28.407]  Publicly, I mean, because I know you wrote notes, the descriptions of the $700 bill.
[02:44:30.564 --> 02:44:36.287]  That particular forum that was the session was Kelly Taylor's.
[02:44:37.008 --> 02:44:39.429]  And she was the one who... We need to get her in here.
[02:44:39.509 --> 02:44:40.610]  Yeah, you probably do.
[02:44:40.750 --> 02:44:47.233]  She was the one who said that you had Goldman Sachs there, and you had the Royal Bank of Scotland, and they were waving around this money.
[02:44:47.273 --> 02:44:52.776]  And a lot of this money that they were waving around was from pension fund investments.
[02:44:52.836 --> 02:44:54.077]  So like, you know... Oh, man.
[02:44:54.677 --> 02:44:56.338]  I mean, that's what she said.
[02:44:56.378 --> 02:44:57.179]  So anyway,
[02:44:58.631 --> 02:45:00.212]  Come on, 700 billion dollars.
[02:45:00.472 --> 02:45:01.112]  It's not important.
[02:45:01.152 --> 02:45:01.693]  It's not news.
[02:45:02.113 --> 02:45:04.174]  Well, Nation Magazine says it doesn't exist.
[02:45:04.614 --> 02:45:05.134]  Well, no.
[02:45:05.174 --> 02:45:08.396]  The Trans-Texas Corridor exists, but the Napa Zoo probably doesn't exist.
[02:45:08.416 --> 02:45:10.417]  Now you know how this guy can get paid at least 10 grand.
[02:45:10.877 --> 02:45:16.260]  Some of the things I didn't talk about last time, there was a fellow by the name of David Alex there.
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:17.200]  He was one of the presenters.
[02:45:17.661 --> 02:45:20.302]  He was from the Cameron County Regional Mobility Authority.
[02:45:20.542 --> 02:45:26.205]  That's one of those authorities created by that sneaky bill back in 2003 that created the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:45:27.103 --> 02:45:42.237]  And he was discussing how the, Cameron County is right there on the border with Mexico, and he said that we need to be thinking of the Rio Grande River as nothing more than a, treated as a street with water in it.
[02:45:43.298 --> 02:45:45.760]  You see, don't worry about the border.
[02:45:45.800 --> 02:45:48.342]  There is no border between South Texas and Northern Mexico.
[02:45:48.723 --> 02:45:51.285]  It's nothing but a street with water in it.
[02:45:51.798 --> 02:45:54.864]  I mean, there's no North American Union, there's just no border.
[02:45:55.024 --> 02:45:59.473]  Actually, that brings me to another thing I don't... Ah, I think I might have talked about this last time.
[02:45:59.793 --> 02:46:00.915]  The I-69 coalition...
[02:46:03.192 --> 02:46:03.492]  I think so.
[02:46:22.930 --> 02:46:24.331]  I don't think so.
[02:46:51.633 --> 02:46:54.774]  These globalists, these one-worlders, they don't exist.
[02:46:55.634 --> 02:47:04.116]  In their world, in their little fantasy world, whoever has the slaves, the most slaves to exploit, gets the business.
[02:47:04.176 --> 02:47:05.916]  I mean, that's free trade.
[02:47:06.396 --> 02:47:12.618]  Go over to China, they've got people stacked up like cordwood in these little apartments working for Walmart seven days a week.
[02:47:13.258 --> 02:47:13.579]  I think so.
[02:47:29.452 --> 02:47:42.676]  Where they acknowledge now, they didn't acknowledge it for many years, but they acknowledge now that they do this multi, multi-million dollar business in organ harvesting when they go out and kill prisoners, like fat on gong prisoners.
[02:47:42.956 --> 02:47:53.920]  Hey, if you want a new liver or something, well, you know, we'll do a tissue type and a blood type and we'll find you a nice juicy prisoner that matches up with you and we'll kill his sorry behind and you'll get a nice liver.
[02:47:54.380 --> 02:47:57.181]  This is the kind of people, this is a government
[02:47:58.288 --> 02:48:05.551]  That we are inviting to bring a tsunami of freight over into our country to enrich them even further.
[02:48:05.931 --> 02:48:12.714]  The moral considerations, the ethical considerations, the national security considerations of all of this are nothing.
[02:48:12.734 --> 02:48:16.176]  Well this is what's important and I add a point to what you just said.
[02:48:17.316 --> 02:48:19.297]  It shows the mindset of our elite.
[02:48:20.393 --> 02:48:24.555]  That they think this is normal, and that they give China awards saying they're the model.
[02:48:24.936 --> 02:48:33.120]  Because, you know, it was George Bush Senior, who was over there in 74, and he made the deal with them, Bob, when he was ambassador for the One Child Policy.
[02:48:33.260 --> 02:48:34.821]  They're morally bankrupt, Alex.
[02:48:36.302 --> 02:48:36.822]  No, they're good.
[02:48:36.862 --> 02:48:39.424]  Let's turn our guns into the government, Bob, and they'll take good care of us.
[02:48:39.804 --> 02:48:41.084]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:48:48.795 --> 02:48:51.998]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.319 --> 02:48:54.281]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.641 --> 02:49:02.289]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.975 --> 02:49:10.017]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.418 --> 02:49:21.861]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.161 --> 02:49:25.683]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.123 --> 02:49:28.083]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.384 --> 02:49:32.225]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:47.192 --> 02:49:48.232]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:48.573 --> 02:49:51.354]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.614 --> 02:49:55.776]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:56.196 --> 02:49:57.037]  So what do you do?
[02:49:57.337 --> 02:50:01.899]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:02.399 --> 02:50:04.521]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:05.001 --> 02:50:19.713]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:19.753 --> 02:50:26.819]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:50:27.159 --> 02:50:31.542]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:50:32.002 --> 02:50:33.784]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:33.804 --> 02:50:34.024]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:50:34.104 --> 02:50:35.585]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:50:45.296 --> 02:50:51.319]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home that you can use anytime that helps reduce back pain, sciatica, hip pain, and more?
[02:50:51.519 --> 02:50:54.280]  A tool that helps relieve the pain and doesn't just treat the symptoms.
[02:50:54.540 --> 02:50:56.781]  You need the Sacrowegi Sacral Stabilizer.
[02:50:57.101 --> 02:51:00.683]  One satisfied user states, I don't believe in gadgets, but this is a miracle.
[02:51:00.823 --> 02:51:01.644]  Yes, that's right.
[02:51:01.704 --> 02:51:06.706]  Just relax 20 minutes daily or when needed to help correct the muscle imbalance that creates many of these symptoms.
[02:51:06.906 --> 02:51:10.568]  Gravity does the work with the Sacrowegi under the sacrum and support under your neck.
[02:51:10.768 --> 02:51:11.208]  Help correct
[02:51:11.528 --> 02:51:11.768]  Thank you.
[02:51:41.468 --> 02:51:41.748]  737-9295 today.
[02:51:41.768 --> 02:51:43.989]  They came and took it all away.
[02:51:44.009 --> 02:51:50.751]  Yeah, they, uh, taxed out of Texas.
[02:51:50.811 --> 02:51:52.391]  It's the same all over the country.
[02:51:52.411 --> 02:51:53.052]  Same people.
[02:52:01.483 --> 02:52:06.028]  Since it'll be a hundred and sixty plus dollars to drive to Dallas and back.
[02:52:06.729 --> 02:52:15.318]  I mean, you can drive to Dallas and back on one tank of gas, forty bucks.
[02:52:15.759 --> 02:52:17.821]  And they tell lies like, well we need these...
[02:52:19.361 --> 02:52:26.706]  We need these systems and these toll roads and these transponders to tax you because there's no more money from gas taxes.
[02:52:27.427 --> 02:52:29.988]  No, that's gone way up and the use of oil's gone way up.
[02:52:30.028 --> 02:52:30.809]  Just all lies.
[02:52:31.069 --> 02:52:34.692]  You can verify it all as lies in two seconds if you had any background, any history.
[02:52:35.032 --> 02:52:41.977]  But the average American doesn't know that they use 22 million barrels of oil a day in this country and growing from 15 million just a few years ago.
[02:52:42.617 --> 02:52:44.959]  But gas tax receipts are at all-time highs.
[02:52:45.726 --> 02:52:49.187]  The tax documents came out, they had over six billion in surplus cash.
[02:52:50.068 --> 02:52:50.728]  Rolling in money.
[02:52:51.948 --> 02:52:53.729]  Bob Dacey, I mean, it's just all lies.
[02:52:53.789 --> 02:52:57.891]  It is a tsunami, a wall of lying criminals.
[02:52:58.391 --> 02:53:06.374]  Well, you need a tsunami of lies in order to get a tsunami of freight over here up to that NAFTA supercar corridor, which Mr. Christopher Hayes planned.
[02:53:06.394 --> 02:53:08.335]  Which will further destroy any middle class that was here.
[02:53:08.475 --> 02:53:09.095]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:53:09.135 --> 02:53:14.137]  I mean, you know, all it's going to do is encourage more industrial production to leave the United States.
[02:53:15.398 --> 02:53:20.541]  It's going to throw a bunch of teamsters, their kooks too by the way, because they oppose it.
[02:53:20.681 --> 02:53:24.724]  Because they know that the Mexican dock workers don't work for, they work for peanuts.
[02:53:24.784 --> 02:53:27.226]  Well I mean all that aside, just all that aside.
[02:53:27.634 --> 02:53:29.795]  I mean, forget the Teamsters, forget our jobs even.
[02:53:30.195 --> 02:53:36.338]  Folks, do you want to have the North American Union and have the tax money from the toll roads on all our major roads go to fund it?
[02:53:36.358 --> 02:53:37.358]  Because that's what they say they're doing.
[02:53:37.599 --> 02:53:39.019]  Yeah, basically they are.
[02:53:39.159 --> 02:53:47.863]  Like an article that I posted on your website last year, they want to con us into paying for our own demise.
[02:53:48.143 --> 02:53:49.004]  That's the bottom line.
[02:53:49.324 --> 02:53:51.705]  They want to con us into paying for our own demise.
[02:53:51.785 --> 02:53:54.126]  Well, in closing, Endgame.
[02:53:54.847 --> 02:53:58.688]  It's going to premiere on the 4th, 5th, and 6th at the Elmwood Raft House, South Lamar.
[02:53:58.908 --> 02:54:00.088]  We don't have links up yet to it.
[02:54:00.448 --> 02:54:04.429]  I've been so busy, I forgot to even plug that that's coming up.
[02:54:04.449 --> 02:54:05.330]  They always sell out.
[02:54:05.350 --> 02:54:09.691]  We're having three showings here, and then a showing in New York, and then that's going to be it.
[02:54:10.691 --> 02:54:18.073]  So, if you want to do that, I hope that you will go get your tickets there.
[02:54:18.533 --> 02:54:21.253]  But, the film is the best work I've ever done.
[02:54:21.753 --> 02:54:24.234]  It's not going to be available on DVD until October.
[02:54:25.371 --> 02:54:26.552]  It is the best work I've ever done.
[02:54:26.612 --> 02:54:29.454]  It goes into the history of the New World Order, how they financed the wars.
[02:54:30.174 --> 02:54:31.795]  Then we go to Bilderberg, Ottawa, Canada.
[02:54:31.875 --> 02:54:34.257]  Then we show the Trans-Atlantic Highway, North American Union.
[02:54:34.657 --> 02:54:39.740]  Then we get into, okay, now you know what their plan is, what they're up to, let's get into their ideology.
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:48.785]  And we have document after document where they say that they want to engage in euthanasia and eugenics on the population.
[02:54:49.146 --> 02:54:51.387]  And these people are completely psychopathic.
[02:54:52.285 --> 02:54:54.427]  Uh, Bob, I can't wait to show you Endgame.
[02:54:55.227 --> 02:54:56.388]  I can't wait to see it, Alex.
[02:54:56.728 --> 02:54:58.910]  Every time you put one out, it's better than the last one.
[02:54:58.930 --> 02:54:59.670]  I don't know how you do it.
[02:54:59.750 --> 02:55:01.672]  Well, Terror Storm was better than anything else we've ever made.
[02:55:01.692 --> 02:55:07.476]  Okay, this is like, let's say Terror Storm was one level above Order of Death, or one level above Martial Law.
[02:55:07.496 --> 02:55:09.217]  This is about five levels above that.
[02:55:10.131 --> 02:55:11.212]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:55:11.232 --> 02:55:14.756]  I mean, this is like, believe me, big-time filmmakers are going to see this and go, what?
[02:55:15.136 --> 02:55:15.897]  Well, I can't wait.
[02:55:16.117 --> 02:55:16.678]  I can't wait.
[02:55:16.738 --> 02:55:23.045]  You know, that just makes me want to fight the NAFTA treaty, fight the superhighway.
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:25.141]  You know, get rid of NAFTA.
[02:55:25.181 --> 02:55:26.562]  That'd be a great thing to do, you know.
[02:55:26.582 --> 02:55:33.047]  Well, I just want the rider over there at the CFR Run Nation, remember they used to say 10 years ago the CFR didn't exist?
[02:55:33.568 --> 02:55:35.149]  And now they're all over TV because we've exposed them.
[02:55:35.810 --> 02:55:37.511]  I want them to know that's why you're illegitimate.
[02:55:37.531 --> 02:55:39.112]  That's why you're losing circulation.
[02:55:39.132 --> 02:55:40.233]  That's why you're falling apart.
[02:55:40.773 --> 02:55:43.796]  And that's why they've all rallied together to start shutting down the web now, because they know that.
[02:55:44.236 --> 02:55:45.476]  We're kicking your butt with the truth.
[02:55:45.496 --> 02:55:48.757]  You just keep spewing your half-truths and your lies, and you spin.
[02:55:48.777 --> 02:55:50.818]  We're going to defend this republic.
[02:55:50.978 --> 02:55:56.359]  And then when it all comes down to it, we're going to find out who got paid what, who was on the payroll, who was paid by the White House, and you're going to go to prison.
[02:55:56.999 --> 02:55:58.139]  Because you need to go to prison.
[02:55:58.879 --> 02:56:02.720]  Not for your free speech, but for being organs of international elites engaged in treason.
[02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:03.200]  Bob Dasey?
[02:56:03.660 --> 02:56:05.281]  Thank you very much for having me, Alex.
[02:56:05.301 --> 02:56:08.141]  You agree that if they're knowingly lying about this to the public, it's treason?
[02:56:08.301 --> 02:56:09.602]  Look up the definition of treason.
[02:56:09.642 --> 02:56:10.002]  What is it?
[02:56:10.162 --> 02:56:10.722]  What else is it?
[02:56:11.591 --> 02:56:12.552]  Working against the country.
[02:56:12.612 --> 02:56:13.432]  I want them all arrested.
[02:56:13.832 --> 02:56:14.533]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:56:14.873 --> 02:56:15.634]  I mean, I'm serious.
[02:56:15.814 --> 02:56:17.595]  Listen, when we win this, a lot of you are going to prison.
[02:56:18.275 --> 02:56:18.856]  I hope you know that.
[02:56:18.956 --> 02:56:20.036]  Hey, Bob, thanks for coming in, man.
[02:56:20.056 --> 02:56:20.757]  Appreciate it, Alex.
[02:56:20.797 --> 02:56:21.177]  Great job.
[02:56:21.217 --> 02:56:23.118]  Post and read your article at infowarriors.com.
[02:56:23.278 --> 02:56:24.719]  Thank you.
