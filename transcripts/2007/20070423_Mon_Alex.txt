[00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:41.347]  Big Brother.
[00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:43.127]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:43.127 --> 00:00:44.868]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:46.448]  You want answers?
[00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:48.389]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:52.190]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.272]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.880]  We are live from Austin, Texas, deep behind enemy lines.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.881]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:09.024]  It is the 23rd day of April, 2007.
[00:01:09.024 --> 00:01:12.147]  I'm Jack Blood, filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:01:12.147 --> 00:01:18.231]  Alex will be joining us in about 30 minutes on the broadcast to give us some updates and talk about some breaking news as well.
[00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:23.836]  And we'll be back in the chair tomorrow for your listening pleasure and your edification.
[00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:25.717]  So much news to report today.
[00:01:25.717 --> 00:01:29.280]  The Sunday news cycle starting off the news week.
[00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:41.841]  Almost unwatchable, almost completely useless as they tried to do everything in their power to spin the Virginia Tech story, to spin or counterman the
[00:01:42.643 --> 00:01:50.830]  Alberto Gonzales story, and of course to further pad the war in Iraq, which is really falling to pieces right into our very noses.
[00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.651]  We'll talk about that.
[00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:54.914]  Also, Boris Yeltsin has died today.
[00:01:54.914 --> 00:02:00.359]  Of course, he will be eulogized around the world as a great leader.
[00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:09.427]  We'll talk about that, including some of the information that Boris Yeltsin tried to pass to our government regarding the JFK shooting the Russians immediately.
[00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:18.750]  Going to the conclusion that LBJ was behind the JFK assassination, as well as the Texas oil people.
[00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.272]  This would include Halliburton or Kellogg, Brown and Root, among others.
[00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:30.016]  Of course, we remember that LBJ was the KBR president, Kellogg, Brown and Root president, the Halliburton president.
[00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.017]  This was in all the newspapers back in the day.
[00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:36.079]  It was pretty much acknowledged right out in the open, so we'll talk about that.
[00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.200]  Iran and Iraq.
[00:02:38.228 --> 00:02:47.307]  Let's be very clear here, according to the phony information that we're getting, that is being put out throughout the media, Al-Syiedah in Iran?
[00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:59.193]  I think that's kind of hard to swallow, but according to this information, Iran and Iraq, the LCIA, the quadrants in Iran and Iraq, are planning a massive attack on Britain.
[00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:00.793]  We'll talk about that on the program today.
[00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:11.497]  There's also some information, according to World Net Daily, smoking gun tape that could indict Hillary Clinton, possibly exposing her to a felony.
[00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:15.358]  That would have a five-year prison sentence attached to it.
[00:03:15.358 --> 00:03:17.039]  More Virginia Tech news today.
[00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.720]  More news coming out about the DARPA connections of Virginia Tech.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.161]  We'll talk about that today.
[00:03:22.161 --> 00:03:24.742]  Also, there is something big going on in France.
[00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:25.882]  We'll touch on that.
[00:03:25.882 --> 00:03:30.704]  The left versus right is being billed on Drudge Report and in mainstream media.
[00:03:30.704 --> 00:03:37.286]  But we have a dire warning for you related to this selection process going on in France right now.
[00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:39.927]  More information about Alberto Antigonzalez.
[00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:45.930]  The Cold War, as it pertains to Russia now, with this missile shield in play over Europe.
[00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.191]  We've done the analysis.
[00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:49.393]  This is not a defensive weapon.
[00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:56.057]  This is really a mode or a method to clear the way for offensive weapons in space, creating a space war.
[00:03:56.057 --> 00:03:57.297]  That's not a conspiracy.
[00:03:57.297 --> 00:04:03.721]  This comes right from, oh, Bob Bowman, who we work with, was headed Star Wars under two presidents.
[00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:04.962]  I guess he would know about that.
[00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:29.032]  And then we're going to talk about, in fact, here in just a few minutes, we're going to play you some audio from an incident here in Austin, Texas over the weekend, where John Kerry came in to give a little speech with his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, and they were confronted by a group here in Austin known as the Austin 9-11 Truth Now group, and I thought very professionally,
[00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:34.560]  They managed to address some pretty big issues to John Kerry.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.901]  Really made him squirm.
[00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.121]  Talked about chemtrails.
[00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:39.242]  Talked about genetically modified food.
[00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:41.443]  Talked about depleted uranium.
[00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:44.364]  And, of course, talked about 9-11 and Building 7.
[00:04:44.364 --> 00:04:47.806]  We're going to play that clip for you when we come back from this next break.
[00:04:48.286 --> 00:05:08.825]  I believe also we're going to have Aaron Dooley on the program today to talk about how this got set up and really to show you that you don't need to be afraid of Skull and Bones Kerry or Skull and Bones Hines or any of these super global elitists who will come and visit your town and try to gain your support for their coming selections.
[00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:10.146]  You're going to be interested in this.
[00:05:10.146 --> 00:05:11.707]  This is a good one, folks.
[00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:14.370]  It shows that standing up to the power
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.061]  Certainly has its rewards.
[00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:19.522]  I'm Jack Blood filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:05:19.522 --> 00:05:21.683]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:21.683 --> 00:05:25.185]  We'll take a quick break, come back with more news and information you're not getting anywhere else.
[00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:27.186]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:44.774]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:44.774 --> 00:05:52.398]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:53.109 --> 00:06:00.570]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:12.292]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:16.273]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:18.513]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:18.513 --> 00:06:22.354]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:38.826]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:38.826 --> 00:06:41.867]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:46.449]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:47.610]  So what do you do?
[00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.152]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:52.652 --> 00:06:55.274]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:55.274 --> 00:07:10.003]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:07:10.003 --> 00:07:17.067]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:25.155 --> 00:07:26.696]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:38.893]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:44.415]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:44.415 --> 00:07:50.138]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:50.138 --> 00:07:51.599]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:51.599 --> 00:08:00.483]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:02.765]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[00:08:02.765 --> 00:08:06.970]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:36.078]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:38.880]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.663]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:59.174 --> 00:09:08.242]  This could be the first time that Skull & Bones' John Kerry has been confronted on 9-11 Truth, issues of depleted uranium.
[00:09:08.242 --> 00:09:13.307]  Certainly, I don't think he's gotten a lot of information or rhetoric on chemtrails.
[00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:19.576]  You almost have to watch this video, and that is up at InfoWars.com right now, or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:22.058]  We're going to play some of it for you.
[00:09:22.058 --> 00:09:28.703]  There have been multiple interpretations of what Kerry said and responded to in this.
[00:09:28.703 --> 00:09:36.449]  We'll talk about this, but this was a result of a truth squad attending a Kerry speech, a Kerry stump speech.
[00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:40.713]  He claims he's not running for president, yet he's doing stump speeches around the country with his
[00:09:41.073 --> 00:09:44.675]  Prime financial backer, his wife, Teresa Hines Carey.
[00:09:44.675 --> 00:09:48.338]  And let's remind you, her husband was killed in a plane crash.
[00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:54.721]  He was a Skull and Bones schoolmate, a Yale schoolmate at Skull and Bones with John Carey and George W. Bush.
[00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:57.043]  The guy dies in a plane crash and the next thing you know, she's
[00:09:57.643 --> 00:10:18.362]  Hooking up with John Kerry, so there's a lot of background here to go into you We're gonna have Alex Jones come up here in just about 20 minutes to Kind of get into this and break this down more information about the VT shooting as well But the video in many ways speaks for itself and this really shows that you can speak truth to power you can stand up to these super global elitist and
[00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:32.897]  And, uh, shock them, make them squirm, make them nervous, and hopefully, which you might find in the case of this particular video, again, the picture's kind of worth a thousand words, but hopefully get them to say something on the record that they're not supposed to say.
[00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:41.094]  I think we give these people a little bit too much credit sometimes for being genius, when they're really not very smart at all.
[00:10:41.094 --> 00:10:54.420]  So, it's always good to try to push these people, try to get a, as Webster Tarpley likes to call it, a macaca moment, where you can embarrass and humiliate a politician and potentially end his career flat with a video camera and a tape recorder.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.321]  That's what the people did at Austin 9-11 Truth.
[00:10:57.321 --> 00:10:58.042]  Now, good people.
[00:10:58.042 --> 00:10:58.882]  We know them down here.
[00:10:58.882 --> 00:11:00.583]  They worked very hard to get out 9-11 Truth.
[00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:02.184]  So, we're going to play this video for you.
[00:11:02.184 --> 00:11:02.644]  We'll come back.
[00:11:02.904 --> 00:11:03.806]  Give you some analysis.
[00:11:03.806 --> 00:11:04.527]  John, go ahead and roll that.
[00:11:41.713 --> 00:11:47.495]  I'm sure we have time for just a couple more questions, so we'll try to do them as quick as we can.
[00:11:47.495 --> 00:11:48.455]  We'll move as fast as we can.
[00:11:48.455 --> 00:11:49.235]  Yes ma'am?
[00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:50.175]  Hi, Senator Kerry.
[00:11:50.175 --> 00:12:02.679]  You bring up our sense of personal responsibility as citizens and to hold people responsible and accountable, and I was just wondering if you had ever heard of Dr. Stephen Jones.
[00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:06.380]  He is a professor and was a professor at Brigham Young University.
[00:12:07.156 --> 00:12:07.856]  We're good to go.
[00:12:21.843 --> 00:12:28.346]  That there were chemical compounds and the same chemical composition that made up ceramics.
[00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:31.547]  He believes that this is the result of a controlled demolition.
[00:12:31.547 --> 00:12:46.193]  And I was just wondering, since you are all for holding people accountable and being personally responsible as a citizen, if you were up to hearing witness and expert testimony as to how the World Trade Center was brought down by controlled demolition.
[00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:50.602]  Well, that's a new one to me.
[00:12:50.602 --> 00:12:58.753]  I'd have to... I mean, obviously, I'm open to anything that's based on fact and evidence, and if somebody has evidence, I'll take a look at it.
[00:12:58.753 --> 00:13:00.155]  I'd be happy to take a look at it.
[00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.598]  Also, a question I have for you.
[00:13:02.598 --> 00:13:05.262]  World Trade Center 7 was brought down
[00:13:07.476 --> 00:13:25.239]  On September 11th at 5.20 in the evening, the leaseholder of the World Trade Center complex, Larry Silverstein, gave a public interview on PBS in 2002, and he said that they pulled that building, which is a demolition term for intentionally bringing down a building.
[00:13:25.874 --> 00:13:30.556]  This man made over five billion dollars for those buildings' destruction.
[00:13:30.556 --> 00:13:41.460]  And I want to know if there was ever a formal investigation into Larry Silverstein, the leaseholder of the World Trade Center Complex, and his ties to this entire event.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.301]  I don't believe there's been a formal investigation.
[00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:44.081]  I haven't heard that.
[00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:44.882]  I don't know that.
[00:13:44.882 --> 00:13:55.386]  I do know that that wall, I remember, was in danger, and I think that they made a decision based on the danger that it had of destroying other things, that they did it in a controlled fashion.
[00:13:56.575 --> 00:14:02.122]  Uh, you know, he's part of the construction, reconstruction effort for the memorial and the use of the land, etc.
[00:14:02.122 --> 00:14:05.385]  There's been a long tug-of-war going on in New York.
[00:14:05.385 --> 00:14:10.471]  I am not following every aspect of it because it's not in my jurisdiction, so to speak.
[00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:12.513]  But I'll check on what the story is.
[00:14:12.513 --> 00:14:15.176]  I'll take a look at it, based on what you've said.
[00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:16.137]  You're the first people.
[00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:18.520]  Anywhere in the country, it boggles my attention.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:26.743]  Oh, interestingly enough, the 9-11 Commission report does not even address World Trade Center 7 and the fact that it fell the way that it did.
[00:14:26.743 --> 00:14:27.663]  Let me find out about it.
[00:14:27.663 --> 00:14:28.683]  I don't know enough about it.
[00:14:28.683 --> 00:14:30.884]  It's not in our book, etc.
[00:14:30.884 --> 00:14:32.244]  All right, there you heard it.
[00:14:32.244 --> 00:14:37.366]  These are the first people in the country, according to John Kerry, who have asked him these questions.
[00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:39.927]  He's promised to look into the first question.
[00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:42.368]  That is the research of Professor Stephen Jones.
[00:14:43.095 --> 00:14:45.377]  Which I think we should hold him to.
[00:14:45.377 --> 00:14:56.388]  Unfortunately, in that audio clip, and I'd like to find another audio clip and perhaps play this again if we can get Aaron Dooley on from Austin 9-11 Truth Now, because I like how he sets up his question.
[00:14:56.388 --> 00:14:59.011]  He starts off, you have to understand, this is a very
[00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:01.832]  Controlled situation here.
[00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:02.812]  They're in a bookstore.
[00:15:02.812 --> 00:15:03.792]  They need to be polite.
[00:15:03.792 --> 00:15:08.374]  You heard the rabid applause and clapping, so you're surrounded by the enemy.
[00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:14.115]  And I thought that the gentleman asking the second question did a great job kind of leading up to it.
[00:15:14.115 --> 00:15:22.678]  He gave a few compliments to Kerry about his book and segued right into, from environmentalism, right into genetically modified food.
[00:15:23.118 --> 00:15:28.560]  Chemtrails, depleted uranium, and then went right into the Building 7 information.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.401]  So I really loved how he kind of worked up to that question.
[00:15:32.401 --> 00:15:38.583]  I can predict for you that John Kerry will no longer be taking any unscripted questions.
[00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:51.788]  This means that if we don't have the opportunity again to speak truth to power in a uniform or a professional manner as these people have done here in Austin, Texas over the weekend at this particular engagement by John Kerry,
[00:15:52.563 --> 00:15:54.806]  Uh, then we're going to have to be rude about it.
[00:15:54.806 --> 00:15:55.186]  All right?
[00:15:55.186 --> 00:16:02.395]  But it is always preferable to try to be as professional as possible when asking these questions to these criminals.
[00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:04.016]  And let's call John Kerry what he is.
[00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:04.877]  He's a criminal.
[00:16:04.877 --> 00:16:12.206]  He covered up for the BCCI banking scandal, covered up for Iran-Contra, and has been a cover-up artist now for, well, his whole life.
[00:16:13.002 --> 00:16:40.747]  uh... and controlled opposition in the vietnam war i mean we can go on and on and on about the uh... lists of high crimes and misdemeanors by john kerry say that this is in his jurisdiction i mean he is a u s senator i would assume that anything under the headline of nine eleven is in his jurisdiction especially when one of the alleged hijackers uh... took off from boston logan airport which happens to be his home state now let's get into the uh... the controversy here because i'm probably reading this a little bit different
[00:16:41.107 --> 00:16:44.929]  Then some of the other people who have done the analysis on this story.
[00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:50.311]  The headlines I received today in my mailbox were, John Kerry admits a controlled demolition.
[00:16:50.311 --> 00:16:59.496]  But if you listen very carefully, and I think this might have been one of the problems with follow-up questions in this particular instance.
[00:16:59.496 --> 00:17:02.477]  If you listen very carefully, he's deflecting the question.
[00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:08.602]  And equating controlled demolition, again, trying to deflect the question, change the subject.
[00:17:08.602 --> 00:17:12.045]  And this is really, I think, evident of somebody who does know what's going on.
[00:17:12.045 --> 00:17:14.947]  Otherwise, he's not going to be deflecting the question.
[00:17:14.947 --> 00:17:19.009]  He's going to be listening to the question, trying to address the question, and answer that question.
[00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:24.453]  Instead, he tried to twist it into talking about the remains of Building 7, the remains actually of
[00:17:24.973 --> 00:17:25.414]  We're good to go.
[00:17:41.898 --> 00:17:46.922]  You know, I guess debate the problem of how that memorial is going to go up.
[00:17:46.922 --> 00:17:49.164]  So he changed and twisted the question.
[00:17:49.164 --> 00:17:56.110]  I think we're really jumping to conclusions here if we think that John Kerry has just admitted that there was a controlled demolition.
[00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:00.793]  But there is some reading between the lines in this and it's an interesting topic.
[00:18:00.793 --> 00:18:06.318]  I do, you know, certainly want to get into this and I know Alex is going to come up here very shortly to try to help us dissect it.
[00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:07.999]  Also, somebody from Austin 9-11 Truth
[00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:11.108]  Uh, coming aboard on the program today.
[00:18:11.108 --> 00:18:14.051]  And I just can't be prouder of the people here in Austin, Texas.
[00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.054]  And not just Austin, because I know people up in Tulsa.
[00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.836]  Uh, we were just up in Dallas.
[00:18:17.836 --> 00:18:20.599]  Uh, the people that are brave enough to go up against
[00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:32.682]  I don't know if I'll get into it on the program today on Alex's show.
[00:18:32.682 --> 00:18:36.304]  I definitely will on my program following the show today.
[00:18:36.304 --> 00:18:37.925]  We did an event up in Dallas.
[00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:51.518]  Under about six to seven hours of police harassment and surveillance and I believe it's because I said 9-11 was an inside job and there were some people in Dallas that just frankly didn't want to hear that.
[00:18:51.518 --> 00:18:53.560]  I'll tell you the whole story on my program.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:19:00.847]  I don't want to go into too much personal and private information here but it was quite an odyssey to say the least.
[00:19:00.847 --> 00:19:02.229]  Going back to this particular
[00:19:03.595 --> 00:19:13.319]  Again, I mean, it is just so important, and to raise the issue of Dr. Stephen Jones' scientific research, to put that in front of these people, to talk about accountability.
[00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:22.542]  And here is a good example of the first woman asking the question in this particular instance, using Carrie's words against him, if I may be so bold.
[00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:40.545]  And that is, he's talking about personal accountability, accountability of course of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq, and using that to say, since you're so interested in accountability, have you seen the research, have you seen the science as it pertains to the World Trade Center towers in 9-11?
[00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:51.060]  And I thought that she just did a great job in that and putting together some of the information that Steven Jones has put out and making him say on the record that he's going to be looking into this.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:58.467]  Now of course we know this is what they always say to try to sidestep the issue and I think in some ways maybe we shouldn't fall for that.
[00:19:58.467 --> 00:20:02.750]  Getting them to say that is good but following up with more questions.
[00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.491]  Staying on the ball.
[00:20:03.491 --> 00:20:07.414]  Listening closely to the answers and if they skirt the answers to
[00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:17.226]  They skirt the answers to call them on that and to force them to be accountable.
[00:20:17.226 --> 00:20:18.667]  I believe we're going to break right now.
[00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:19.808]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:19.808 --> 00:20:20.389]  I'm Jack Blood.
[00:20:20.389 --> 00:20:20.829]  Stay tuned.
[00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:42.803]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:42.803 --> 00:20:47.187]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:47.187 --> 00:20:48.048]  We listened.
[00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:53.313]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:53.313 --> 00:20:54.194]  We listened.
[00:20:54.194 --> 00:20:57.638]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:57.638 --> 00:20:58.659]  We listened.
[00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:01.922]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:21:02.042 --> 00:21:02.603]  We're good to go.
[00:21:19.065 --> 00:21:21.908]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[00:21:21.908 --> 00:21:22.168]  Only $279.
[00:21:22.168 --> 00:21:23.329]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:23.329 --> 00:21:23.649]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.311]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:36.175 --> 00:21:38.098]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:42.564]  On April 23, 2007, Gold Spot 691 one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $7.12, $3.58.53 for half, $1.79.26 for quarter ounce coins at $7.12.98, $3.58.53, and $1.79.26.
[00:21:52.876 --> 00:21:56.519]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:59.621]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:21:59.621 --> 00:22:09.027]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:14.311]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:17.114]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:22:17.114 --> 00:22:19.937]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:22:19.937 --> 00:22:23.281]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:23.281 --> 00:22:27.025]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:22:27.025 --> 00:22:27.325]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:27.325 --> 00:22:27.505]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:39.035]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:39.035 --> 00:22:48.457]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:48.457 --> 00:22:55.579]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:56.306 --> 00:23:02.288]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:20.353 --> 00:23:37.623]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:23:37.623 --> 00:23:39.084]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:42.285]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:42.285 --> 00:23:45.007]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[00:23:45.578 --> 00:23:52.866]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:24:21.776 --> 00:24:22.177]  That's 877-873-9626.
[00:24:56.139 --> 00:24:59.031]  We're fucked down again.
[00:25:02.817 --> 00:25:09.742]  Thanks for tuning in to the Genesis Communications Network, the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:09.742 --> 00:25:12.785]  I'm Jack Blood, your radio gun, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:25:12.785 --> 00:25:17.868]  He should be popping up with us here in about six minutes on the show today to help us cover some breaking news on the program.
[00:25:17.868 --> 00:25:27.395]  We'll be going to your calls shortly thereafter, and I'm told that Joseph Kilgus will be joining us from the 9-11 Truth Group that took on John Kerry here over the weekend.
[00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:28.056]  Great story.
[00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:30.677]  I love reporting these things from around the country.
[00:25:30.677 --> 00:25:32.857]  This is the difference that we really see.
[00:25:32.857 --> 00:25:40.100]  This is the difference between 2007 9-11 truth or truth in general and say 2005.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:53.664]  People are really taking it to them and of course it couldn't have been more evident on the fifth anniversary of 9-11 at Ground Zero where roughly 2,000 people in identical Investigate 9-11 t-shirts were at Ground Zero.
[00:25:53.664 --> 00:25:54.344]  Alex Jones
[00:25:55.834 --> 00:25:58.396]  A great moment in his career, I think.
[00:25:58.396 --> 00:26:00.559]  As brave as you can possibly be.
[00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:08.968]  Bullhorned round zero with 9-11 as an inside job before he went on to bullhorn the CFR and Silverstein properties.
[00:26:10.357 --> 00:26:17.563]  This is really the difference now in 2007, and this is something that I don't think we'll be rolling back on.
[00:26:17.563 --> 00:26:19.705]  I think this is something that's going to gain momentum.
[00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:34.958]  The more of you out there who see that you can get away with these truth actions and do so with a modicum of publicity and a lot of support, the more people that are going to do it and the more scared the government is going to be of the people.
[00:26:34.958 --> 00:26:37.380]  Of course, you remember the old adage, the old quote,
[00:26:38.254 --> 00:26:45.936]  A people that are afraid of their government receive tyranny, and a government afraid of the people project liberty.
[00:26:45.936 --> 00:26:49.536]  And this is something always very important to remember.
[00:26:49.536 --> 00:26:50.436]  Don't be scared.
[00:26:50.436 --> 00:26:51.917]  Never back down.
[00:26:51.917 --> 00:26:52.937]  Get in their faces.
[00:26:52.937 --> 00:26:58.618]  And the more of you that do it, the easier it's going to be, and the more and the easier it's going to be to get away with it.
[00:26:58.618 --> 00:27:00.218]  So I'm really proud of people that do that.
[00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:03.039]  We'll talk about that also in the second hour of the broadcast today.
[00:27:03.759 --> 00:27:12.829]  One of the things we mentioned in this clip was depleted uranium, and we have a story on that put out, I believe, by the Daytona Beach News Journal.
[00:27:12.829 --> 00:27:16.293]  Soldier health scare back in the news.
[00:27:16.293 --> 00:27:17.054]  It goes like this.
[00:27:17.054 --> 00:27:25.343]  Lori Brim cradled her son in her arms for three months before he died at the famous now Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.
[00:27:26.247 --> 00:27:40.334]  Dustin Brim, a 22-year-old Army specialist, had collapsed three years ago in Iraq from a very aggressive cancer that attacked his kidney and caused a mass growth over his esophagus and a collapsed lung.
[00:27:40.334 --> 00:27:51.560]  The problem she saw during her time at Walter Reed, including her son screaming in pain while doctors argued over medications, had nothing to do with the mold and the shabby conditions documented in recent news reports.
[00:27:52.429 --> 00:27:56.810]  What his mother saw was an unexplainable illness consuming her son.
[00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:01.651]  And what she has learned since her son's death is that this was not an isolated case.
[00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:18.455]  Lori Brim has joined other parents, hundreds of other sick soldiers, legislators, research scientists, and environmental activists who say the cause of their problems results from exposure to depleted uranium, a radioactive metal used in the manufacturing of US tank armor and weapons casings.
[00:28:19.309 --> 00:28:23.692]  Health and environmental effects of depleted uranium are at the heart of scientific studies.
[00:28:23.692 --> 00:28:28.515]  A lawsuit in the New York courts and legislative bills in more than a dozen states.
[00:28:28.515 --> 00:28:32.017]  Although, as they note in this article, not in Florida.
[00:28:32.017 --> 00:28:39.822]  News stories claiming negative signs of depleted uranium's impact, including death and birth defects, are surfacing from Australia to England to the Far East.
[00:28:39.822 --> 00:28:47.447]  The controversy rages within government bodies and underlines the theme of TV shows, like a recent episode of the medical series, House.
[00:28:48.826 --> 00:28:49.386]  Gotta see that.
[00:28:49.386 --> 00:28:57.292]  If anybody has that issue of House, I can't stand that show, but if they're talking about depleted uranium, I'd sure like to see it.
[00:28:57.292 --> 00:29:09.981]  While the military continues to deny the connection of depleted uranium to sickness plaguing returning servicemen and women, the newly mandated study stemming from legislation signed by President Bush in October is just getting underway.
[00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:13.964]  A too little too late will be the headline of that particular column.
[00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:20.887]  A new study which begins in March follows several that have been completed by the military into depleted uranium.
[00:29:20.887 --> 00:29:26.729]  A byproduct left when enriched uranium is separated out for use in nuclear power and atomic weapons.
[00:29:26.729 --> 00:29:35.531]  The Department of Energy gives it to arms makers where its extreme density is valuable in the manufacture of armor and casings.
[00:29:36.926 --> 00:29:48.692]  I wonder if George Bush or the legislators or anybody looking into this, this particular woman in general and their coalition, have had a chance to talk to Colonel Doug Rocky.
[00:29:48.692 --> 00:29:59.177]  Despite a 1996 UN resolution opposing its use because of the discovery of health problems after the first Gulf War, that's right, it's been acknowledged by the United Nations, it must be true,
[00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:09.129]  The military studies have concluded there was no evidence that exposure to the metal caused illness, except the evidence of the dying cancerous soldiers.
[00:30:09.129 --> 00:30:10.949]  We can talk more about it on the program today as well.
[00:30:10.949 --> 00:30:12.529]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:13.829]  We'll be right back after this.
[00:30:13.829 --> 00:30:26.111]  Infowars.com.
[00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:27.492]  We're on the march.
[00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.012]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:30.018 --> 00:30:36.422]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:23.582 --> 00:31:24.083]  We're good to go.
[00:31:36.112 --> 00:31:43.600]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program and million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.622]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[00:31:45.622 --> 00:31:51.267]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[00:31:51.267 --> 00:31:57.173]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[00:31:57.453 --> 00:32:00.074]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.
[00:32:00.074 --> 00:32:07.175]  No matter what network marketing venture you're involved in, MLM Incorporated can provide you the successful tools you need to truly succeed.

[00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:40.913]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.

[00:32:44.555 --> 00:32:53.560]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:33:00.583]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:04.285]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[00:33:04.765 --> 00:33:10.008]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[00:33:10.008 --> 00:33:17.233]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[00:33:17.233 --> 00:33:19.294]  And it's so easy to use!

[00:33:54.512 --> 00:34:05.115]  If you don't stand up for your rights, I don't know who's going to.
[00:34:05.115 --> 00:34:18.340]  And I'd like to say, get under your bed, get up in your attic, find the lockbox that has your constitutional rights in it, your God-given rights, break it open,
[00:34:19.125 --> 00:34:20.206]  And start using them.
[00:34:20.206 --> 00:34:23.989]  If you don't, they're going to go away and be replaced with privileges.
[00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:25.049]  Thanks for joining us again, folks.
[00:34:25.049 --> 00:34:28.252]  Jack Blood sitting in if you just joined us for the Alex Jones program today.
[00:34:28.252 --> 00:34:34.956]  We're expecting Alex to join us any minute on the program today, analyzing and breaking down some breaking news stories.
[00:34:34.956 --> 00:34:39.840]  So for you, again, talking to Joseph Kilgus in the second hour of the program today about their
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:43.863]  9-11 Truth Action on John Kerry here in Austin, Texas over the weekend.
[00:34:43.863 --> 00:34:44.864]  We'll be going to your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:34:44.864 --> 00:34:44.944]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:44.944 --> 00:34:45.925]  We'll get to you as soon as possible.
[00:34:45.925 --> 00:34:47.146]  Just a ton of news to report today.
[00:34:47.146 --> 00:34:49.908]  As I like to always correct myself, it's only 1,000 pounds of news to report today.
[00:34:49.908 --> 00:34:50.049]  Maybe 1,500.
[00:34:50.049 --> 00:34:50.289]  Not 2,000 pounds.
[00:34:50.289 --> 00:34:50.689]  So a ton of news.
[00:34:50.689 --> 00:34:51.790]  Possibly a misnomer.
[00:35:01.378 --> 00:35:06.100]  Going back to depleted uranium, I think this is an extremely important issue to discuss.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:11.623]  In fact, we do get distracted quite a bit in supporting the troops to forget how to support the troops.
[00:35:11.623 --> 00:35:15.925]  And one way to do that is to blow open the whole depleted uranium issue.
[00:35:15.925 --> 00:35:26.930]  Of course, our friend Dr. Doug Rocky is the one who instituted the Pentagon's study on how to use this, what would be the only appropriate way to use it.
[00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.511]  He, of course, went to Iraq and
[00:35:29.111 --> 00:35:33.973]  Oversaw the cleanup of depleted uranium, which is just beyond imagination.
[00:35:33.973 --> 00:35:48.059]  And not just in Iraq, by the way, or Afghanistan, folks, or in war zones around the world, but right here in the United States, as depleted uranium is tested in the United States at battlegrounds, testing grounds, various military bases throughout the country.
[00:35:49.351 --> 00:35:54.933]  But look, I mean, if we support our troops, and when I heard the Walter Reed story, this is the first thing I thought of.
[00:35:54.933 --> 00:36:01.034]  Man, we've got to get Doug Rocky up, we've got to have Doug Rocky talk about depleted uranium, because this is the underlying story.
[00:36:01.034 --> 00:36:08.236]  So when we talked earlier in the last segment about George W. Bush signing a Department of Defense authorization legislation in 2006, October 2006,
[00:36:10.857 --> 00:36:16.343]  Which accompanied a House Amendment, which was authored and introduced by Jim McDermott.
[00:36:16.343 --> 00:36:26.073]  He is a Democrat, or maybe was a Democrat in Washington, ordering a comprehensive study about depleted uranium, which was due in one year.
[00:36:26.073 --> 00:36:27.514]  So that would be October 2007.
[00:36:27.514 --> 00:36:28.455]  It would be potentially due.
[00:36:32.186 --> 00:36:36.729]  We have to ask, are you talking to Dr. Doug Rocky?
[00:36:36.729 --> 00:36:45.873]  In fact, I believe, and I'd like to give you a call to action, people who say, you never tell us what to do, we don't know what to do, here's something you can do.
[00:36:45.873 --> 00:36:55.358]  You can write Jim McDermott, and we'll test and see how honest he is about this subject, and make sure that he knows to talk to Dr. Rocky, if he hasn't already.
[00:36:55.358 --> 00:37:00.161]  I want to make sure he's talking to him, and I guess, why not write Joe Lieberman,
[00:37:01.044 --> 00:37:06.670]  Who put together a Senate companion bill to study the health effects on U.S.
[00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.691]  soldiers from the U.S.
[00:37:07.691 --> 00:37:10.754]  military's use of depleted uranium, DU.
[00:37:10.754 --> 00:37:14.578]  Because if we don't, this study will be operating as a cover-up.
[00:37:14.578 --> 00:37:15.939]  That's what these studies are.
[00:37:15.939 --> 00:37:17.781]  I mean, you know, I'll give you a good example.
[00:37:17.781 --> 00:37:18.762]  The 9-11 Commission.
[00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:26.951]  As we mentioned earlier, John Kerry's, the Kerry Commission, which investigated BCCI.
[00:37:26.951 --> 00:37:43.535]  Of course, they had to put Kerry in charge of that commission, because what they're going to find is that both Clinton and Bush were knee-deep in money laundering, among other crimes and scams, with the Bank of Crooks and Criminals, International, as I like to call it.
[00:37:43.535 --> 00:37:49.496]  So, when we see that there's a study, of course, the Iraq Study Group, we saw what became of that, headed by James Becker III.
[00:37:51.433 --> 00:38:00.159]  When we see study, comprehensive study, legislation put out by Congress, the Senate, and the White House, we know that this is a cover-up.
[00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:07.724]  So we've got to give them all of the ammunition, no pun intended, that they need in order to do a proper investigation.
[00:38:07.724 --> 00:38:11.267]  We've got to stay on them to make sure that that investigation is done.
[00:38:11.767 --> 00:38:15.168]  Just more news on the depleted uranium.
[00:38:15.168 --> 00:38:20.189]  February 6, 2007, the New York newspaper, the Post-Chronicle, reported that the U.S.
[00:38:20.189 --> 00:38:32.531]  government scientists at Ames Laboratory in Iowa say that they are close to developing a nanostructured material of tungsten and metallic glass to eliminate the use of depleted uranium in ammunition.
[00:38:32.531 --> 00:38:36.492]  In other words, finding a tangible substitute for DU.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:51.304]  In a recent phone call by the news journal to senior scientist Dan Sortelet, reported to be leading the research team, he said that he's no longer working on that, and he declined to give any further information.
[00:38:51.304 --> 00:38:54.365]  So again, there's a nanostructured material.
[00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:55.225]  I have to look into this.
[00:38:55.225 --> 00:38:56.726]  I don't know how safe this would be.
[00:38:56.726 --> 00:38:57.546]  I don't know what the
[00:38:58.965 --> 00:39:13.594]  The dire consequences of the tungsten and the metallic glass might be in replacement for depleted uranium, but according to the news journal, the senior scientist working on this has decided he's not working on that any longer.
[00:39:13.594 --> 00:39:15.055]  It might be too expensive.
[00:39:15.055 --> 00:39:15.675]  I don't know.
[00:39:15.675 --> 00:39:27.382]  One of the things we have to keep in mind about depleted uranium, and any of these nefarious substances, including weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons, non-lethal weapons which are being used in Iraq currently,
[00:39:28.428 --> 00:39:35.993]  As we remember in Fallujah just a year or two ago, napalm being used on citizens and children.
[00:39:35.993 --> 00:39:45.499]  Of course, this was also used in the war last summer, the genocidal war against Beirut and Lebanon by Israel, a total and abject failure.
[00:39:45.499 --> 00:39:50.122]  Again, more so empowering Hezbollah or Hamas than anything else.
[00:39:50.122 --> 00:39:56.425]  But we have to remember about this, and I know people are going to be upset when I say this, but this is really the truth.
[00:39:56.425 --> 00:39:57.126]  This is war.
[00:39:58.288 --> 00:40:14.704]  So if anybody's listening to this broadcast and maybe now you're wondering, well you're probably pretty sure at this point that you made a mistake in initially supporting the war, the war on terror, George Bush's war or domination of the Middle East, remember that this is what you're supporting.
[00:40:15.422 --> 00:40:20.443]  If there's anybody out there that still thinks, and we've got a clip from Kurt Nimmo's website.
[00:40:20.443 --> 00:40:22.763]  It's kind of a jaywalking thing.
[00:40:22.763 --> 00:40:23.443]  People don't know.
[00:40:23.443 --> 00:40:27.904]  I think one of the things is, name a country that starts with U. Nobody could think of one.
[00:40:27.904 --> 00:40:28.964]  They live in one.
[00:40:28.964 --> 00:40:31.545]  But, I mean, this is the type of people we deal with.
[00:40:31.545 --> 00:40:37.346]  If you're one of those people, you know one of these people, make sure that they understand that this is what war is.
[00:40:37.346 --> 00:40:38.846]  War isn't pretty.
[00:40:38.846 --> 00:40:42.246]  War kills people, kills little children.
[00:40:42.246 --> 00:40:44.967]  War promotes genocide and eugenics, among other things.
[00:40:45.882 --> 00:40:48.505]  And war is an ugly, ugly business.
[00:40:48.505 --> 00:40:54.111]  Now, I remember when I hosted an event with Scott Ritter, who was the former UNSCOM weapons inspector.
[00:40:54.111 --> 00:40:59.377]  He's, of course, the one that noted from the very beginning that they wouldn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[00:40:59.377 --> 00:41:01.219]  He was there looking for them.
[00:41:01.219 --> 00:41:06.165]  And this is how we knew, I guess, ahead of Tim Russert and the rest of the media shills that this would be
[00:41:07.499 --> 00:41:14.925]  A folly to go in there and of course using weapons of mass destruction as a pretext to go in would most certainly be proven wrong.
[00:41:14.925 --> 00:41:25.693]  But going back to an event I did with Scott Ritter and I asked him the question about depleted uranium and he agreed it is a deadly substance that needs to be eradicated but almost excused it saying look we're in war.
[00:41:26.405 --> 00:41:35.298]  And when I'm in war, I want to use every possible method I can to stay alive and to keep my brothers and sisters alive who are fighting next to me.
[00:41:35.298 --> 00:41:37.562]  And if it's depleted uranium, I'll think about it later.
[00:41:38.334 --> 00:41:47.384]  And that was a very telling statement, and you could be mad at me for saying it, or mad at Scott Ritter for bringing up that point, but I think that is the point that needs to be made.
[00:41:47.384 --> 00:41:50.067]  This is what war is.
[00:41:50.067 --> 00:41:51.768]  War is depleted uranium.
[00:41:51.768 --> 00:41:53.230]  War is genocide.
[00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:57.695]  War is the torturing of children in front of their parents to extract information.
[00:41:59.264 --> 00:42:27.098]  among many other things so it is so important to understand that before we go headlong into the next war and certainly that day will come let's remember exactly what war is this is the result of it not to mention the inflated profits in war profiteering by the usual suspects who continue to get more power as they play one of us against another one of us as they promote the clash of civilizations or culture clashes
[00:42:29.755 --> 00:42:32.017]  We're going to take your calls here in just a bit.
[00:42:32.017 --> 00:42:34.498]  I got a lot more information about depleted uranium.
[00:42:34.498 --> 00:42:36.740]  I'll leave it up to you to do your own research.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:42.244]  Please, if you've not heard of DU, please go out and research it and please help us try to do something about this.
[00:42:42.244 --> 00:42:45.807]  If you really and truly support the troops, you'll do that.
[00:42:45.807 --> 00:42:49.009]  In a related story, and this just happened here last week,
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.742]  The court backs the EPA chief in the 9-11 toxins case.
[00:42:54.742 --> 00:43:15.632]  A federal appellate court has decided that it was not a conscious, shocking deal for the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, to have reassured New Yorkers that their air near Ground Zero was safe following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, even if the air was toxic.
[00:43:15.632 --> 00:43:16.572]  Again, let me repeat,
[00:43:17.876 --> 00:43:23.282]  This is what the federal appellate court ruled this week, last week.
[00:43:23.282 --> 00:43:36.837]  That even if the air at Ground Zero was toxic, that it wasn't, quote-unquote, conscience-shocking for the head of the EPA to have reassured New Yorkers to go back to work and to go out and go shopping.
[00:43:38.999 --> 00:43:43.040]  That was a decision, I believe from last Friday, by the 2nd U.S.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:51.282]  Circuit Court of Appeals, throwing out lawsuits against the former leader of the EPA, Christine Todd Whitman.
[00:43:51.282 --> 00:44:02.664]  The panel of three judges reasoned that the government's interest in returning New York to normalcy following the attack should protect it from the lawsuits, alleging, no, telling
[00:44:03.655 --> 00:44:06.677]  That the government made false statements about air quality.
[00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:09.899]  Again, they're not saying that the government didn't make false statements.
[00:44:09.899 --> 00:44:13.481]  They just believe that this was perfectly in order.
[00:44:13.481 --> 00:44:24.067]  The court did not make any factual findings as to the quality of the air, or as to whether the EPA had intentionally misled the public, which they did.
[00:44:24.067 --> 00:44:27.909]  And let's not forget that Hitlery Clinton was involved in this, which Ms.
[00:44:27.909 --> 00:44:29.430]  Whitman has denied in doing.
[00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:34.633]  Of course, don't expect them to admit it anytime soon, especially when they have the U.S.
[00:44:34.633 --> 00:44:37.475]  Appellate Court of Appeals on their side.
[00:44:37.475 --> 00:44:38.495]  This is their ruling.
[00:44:38.495 --> 00:44:59.769]  Quote, when great harm is likely to befall someone no matter what the government official does, the allocation of risk may be a burden on the conscience of the one who must take such decisions, but does not shock the contemporary conscience.
[00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:03.057]  How's that for Orwellian, folks?
[00:45:03.057 --> 00:45:21.568]  The Circuit Chief's Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote, quote, These principles apply, notwithstanding the great service rendered by those who repaired New York, the heroism of those who entered the site when it was unstable and on fire, and the serious health consequences that are plausibly alleged.
[00:45:21.568 --> 00:45:23.930]  Again, this is the ruling.
[00:45:24.918 --> 00:45:40.242]  That it wouldn't have mattered because the government couldn't have cleaned up the air, they couldn't have evacuated and shut down New York, so encouraging people to go out and to breathe the air was not conscience-shocking, quote-unquote.
[00:45:40.242 --> 00:45:46.504]  Whether a government official's actions are conscience-shocking, again they use this, I guess this is a legal term, I've never heard of it,
[00:45:47.729 --> 00:45:54.413]  They say it's a legal standard that decides whether an official is liable in certain types of lawsuits.
[00:45:54.413 --> 00:46:16.267]  This could, by the way, set the stage for further information coming out, because it's very possible, with the evidence that we have, with the emotions involved in this, with the critical mass that 9-11 Truth is becoming, it is very possible that you might see an actual confession
[00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:21.200]  Like the one Kerry is alleged to have given here at Book People in Austin, Texas.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.061]  That yes, we admit we pulled the buildings to save life and property.
[00:46:25.061 --> 00:46:30.803]  But that's not conscience-shocking because we couldn't do anything else and of course we were only trying to protect the people.
[00:46:30.803 --> 00:46:34.243]  So I don't know if this sets a precedent or a standard for something like that.
[00:46:34.243 --> 00:46:35.724]  It certainly seems to.
[00:46:35.724 --> 00:46:44.026]  If nothing else, it sets a standard that the people who are dying as a result from, and as the Firefighters Union says,
[00:46:44.858 --> 00:46:57.222]  sending in rescue workers, not to rescue people, not to find the remains of the loved ones and the victims of 9-11, but to find the gold from the Nova Scotia Bank, which Rudy Giuliani ordered them to find.
[00:46:57.222 --> 00:47:05.965]  Of course, again, as the Firefighters Union has stated, as soon as they found that gold, all rescue efforts were called off immediately.
[00:47:05.965 --> 00:47:11.467]  So that's why they sent them in, and certainly I'm sure this wasn't entered into this particular trial.
[00:47:12.202 --> 00:47:23.352]  Again, whether a government official's actions are conscience-shocking, quote-unquote, is a legal standard that decides whether an official is liable in certain types of lawsuits.
[00:47:23.352 --> 00:47:33.882]  I always thought that if you accepted there were lies, lies to get these people working down there, and that those lies were inherently conscience-shocking,
[00:47:36.511 --> 00:47:37.913]  That there would be a case.
[00:47:37.913 --> 00:47:43.479]  So said the lawyer who brought the case, Steven Riegel of Whiteson Luxembourg PC.
[00:47:43.479 --> 00:47:45.381]  Hmm.
[00:47:45.381 --> 00:47:52.429]  Lawsuit was a class action suit on behalf of those who searched for the survivors and cleaned up Ground Zero following the attacks.
[00:47:52.429 --> 00:47:55.372]  The men now suffer respiratory ailments, to put it lightly.
[00:47:56.036 --> 00:47:58.738]  A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
[00:47:58.738 --> 00:48:07.083]  The court's holding in the case suggests that it will also dismiss a similar suit brought on behalf of the residents near the World Trade Center.
[00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:17.689]  The ruling yesterday is unlikely to have a result on another class action suit on behalf of the workers at Ground Zero, which was brought under a different legal theory, and good for them.
[00:48:17.689 --> 00:48:20.251]  Apparently, they might escape this ruling.
[00:48:20.251 --> 00:48:24.794]  The panel also included judges Rina Raggi and Robert Sack.
[00:48:25.835 --> 00:48:35.998]  In a related story, I guess we can head this up with, could Tom Cruise be the next 9-11 truther?
[00:48:35.998 --> 00:48:42.300]  Because this is exactly what Tom Cruise is doing right now, and maybe why he's been attacked for quite some time, among other things.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:48.582]  Of course, he's come out against the psychiatric control industry and prescription drugs, among other things.
[00:48:48.582 --> 00:48:51.523]  But will he be the next 9-11 celebrity truther?
[00:48:51.523 --> 00:48:53.164]  Tom Cruise's latest efforts
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:59.682]  Isn't for the big screen, it's for the New York Police, Firefighters and Paramedics of September 11th.
[00:48:59.682 --> 00:49:10.526]  Cruz appeared last Thursday at a private dinner in Manhattan to raise money for the New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project, a program he co-founded in 2002 with his wife Katie Holmes.
[00:49:14.358 --> 00:49:33.574]  The program based in principles developed by L. Ron Hubbard, they'll have to throw that in the news store to try to discredit it, offers free treatment to emergency workers who suffer breathing difficulties and other health problems stemming from exposure to toxins at ground zero after September 11, 2001.
[00:49:33.574 --> 00:49:39.219]  Nearly six years later, many are still paying a price for their heroic service at the World Trade Center.
[00:49:39.219 --> 00:49:41.281]  This is a profound injustice
[00:49:42.356 --> 00:49:48.954]  Said the 44 year old actor in a statement to the Associated Press, this project has demonstrated that recovery is not only possible...
[00:49:49.767 --> 00:49:51.347]  But an inconvertible fact.
[00:49:51.347 --> 00:49:58.449]  The program has treated 785 workers since its inception, said the director Jim Woodworth.
[00:49:58.449 --> 00:50:05.510]  Each worker is given vitamins and nutritional counseling and participates in the daily exercise and sauna sessions.
[00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:08.150]  The program takes about 30 days to complete, he said.
[00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:15.832]  The thing is, they're of course writing in here that this is some kooky Scientology program, when really all this is
[00:50:16.798 --> 00:50:26.605]  All this really breaks down to is a big and well-known detoxification program which was adopted by the Scientologists.
[00:50:26.605 --> 00:50:32.769]  So of course you understand we're not promoting Scientology by saying something nice about Tom Cruise.
[00:50:32.769 --> 00:50:35.091]  I suppose this particular effort makes him gay.
[00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:35.451]  I don't know.
[00:50:36.624 --> 00:50:52.758]  But I do know that there are detoxification procedures, some of them which are time-consuming and very expensive, which can be used in order to help these people better than just slapping a court ruling and saying that it wasn't shocking enough to the conscience.
[00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:55.340]  I don't know how that helps the people recover.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:00.505]  I do know that detoxification in this case, if it doesn't help, certainly isn't going to hurt.
[00:51:03.903 --> 00:51:09.905]  So I'd like to support that effort, and also I think I'm going to send Tom Cruise some enter food.
[00:51:09.905 --> 00:51:13.426]  The website for this is, I believe, NYDetox.org.
[00:51:13.426 --> 00:51:17.528]  You can find out more about the New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Program.
[00:51:17.528 --> 00:51:21.609]  We'll come right back and take your calls, cover more news and information you're not getting anywhere else.
[00:51:21.609 --> 00:51:22.850]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:26.051]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:51:39.443 --> 00:51:45.287]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:45.287 --> 00:51:52.892]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:53.624 --> 00:52:01.070]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:12.818]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:12.818 --> 00:52:16.781]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:16.781 --> 00:52:19.043]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:19.043 --> 00:52:22.866]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:14.250]  I think so.
[00:53:36.423 --> 00:53:38.365]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.

[00:53:42.409 --> 00:53:45.131]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[00:53:51.497 --> 00:53:56.382]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:56.582 --> 00:54:05.925]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:55:52.702 --> 00:56:06.490]  Thanks again for joining us today, folks.
[00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.591]  I think our ISDN line just cut out for a minute, but we are back.
[00:56:09.591 --> 00:56:11.532]  Jack Blood, again, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:56:11.532 --> 00:56:12.793]  We're going to go to your calls here.
[00:56:12.793 --> 00:56:14.394]  We've got about 10 minutes to take your calls.
[00:56:14.394 --> 00:56:17.075]  We have a guest that we'll have up for about 10-15 minutes.
[00:56:17.075 --> 00:56:18.036]  Go back to your calls.
[00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:25.926]  And cover a lot of news breaking that you're not hearing anywhere else but on the GCN radio network on the program today.
[00:56:25.926 --> 00:56:27.809]  Alex was scheduled to join us here.
[00:56:27.809 --> 00:56:29.732]  I'm sure he will be very soon.
[00:56:29.732 --> 00:56:31.334]  We'll look forward to that.
[00:56:31.334 --> 00:56:34.999]  Just real quick here, if you have not seen Terror Storm, you have not
[00:56:35.359 --> 00:56:45.126]  Purchase Terror Storm or the Alex Jones films which have really set new standards for documentary filmmaking and DIY filmmaking across this world.
[00:56:45.126 --> 00:56:46.207]  You need to do that now.
[00:56:46.207 --> 00:56:54.874]  That supports the effort in order to continue building the network, continue building on the work that Alex has done such a great job at.
[00:56:55.414 --> 00:56:57.374]  There's actually a deal right now.
[00:56:57.374 --> 00:57:01.595]  You can get both Freedom to Fascism and Terror Storm for a reduced price.
[00:57:01.595 --> 00:57:03.696]  These are two films you want everybody to see.
[00:57:03.696 --> 00:57:07.276]  Terror Storm documents the history of false flag terrorism.
[00:57:07.276 --> 00:57:09.277]  Goes into 9-11 information.
[00:57:09.277 --> 00:57:11.197]  A very, very important film.
[00:57:11.197 --> 00:57:15.078]  Breaking and smashing records for downloads all across the internet.
[00:57:15.078 --> 00:57:20.819]  If you haven't seen this or if you haven't purchased the actual edition of it, please do so.
[00:57:20.819 --> 00:57:21.579]  Make copies.
[00:57:21.579 --> 00:57:22.060]  Get them out.
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.280]  Make sure everybody receives copies of Terror Storm.
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:25.683]  And from freedom to fascism.
[00:57:25.683 --> 00:57:30.894]  You can get them now by going to InfoWars.com InfoWars.com or you can simply call toll-free 888-253-3139
[00:57:34.682 --> 00:57:35.962]  Yes, good morning.
[00:57:35.962 --> 00:57:37.623]  I wanted to tell you that last Thursday night,
[00:58:01.926 --> 00:58:07.254]  Here in Chicago, I went to a place where William Gonzales was telling his story.
[00:58:07.254 --> 00:58:08.656]  Sure.
[00:58:08.656 --> 00:58:17.590]  And he almost didn't get to the theater in time because... ...away from him.
[00:58:18.226 --> 00:58:21.088]  Now this is one of the last men out.
[00:58:21.088 --> 00:58:23.109]  One of the 9-11 heroes.
[00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:26.530]  Decorated by President Bush as a hero for 9-11.
[00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:32.794]  Recruited by the Republican Party to be a big candidate, which he turned down because he wanted to talk about what he talked about.
[00:58:32.794 --> 00:58:34.074]  Okay, so he was detained.
[00:58:34.074 --> 00:58:34.895]  I hadn't heard that.
[00:58:34.895 --> 00:58:36.956]  He's being treated like a terrorist now.
[00:58:38.543 --> 00:58:39.863]  Did he make it to the event?
[00:58:39.863 --> 00:58:43.284]  He got there in time.
[00:58:43.284 --> 00:58:52.927]  I read on thelonelantern.org that he has to go back with his lawyer and get his passport again.
[00:58:52.927 --> 00:58:56.148]  He says that he has quite often been hassled.
[00:58:56.607 --> 00:58:59.229]  At the airport, they keep questioning him.
[00:58:59.229 --> 00:59:00.090]  Where are you going?
[00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:00.930]  What are you doing?
[00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:05.374]  And he says, I've told you... But that hasn't stopped him from telling the truth around the world.
[00:59:05.374 --> 00:59:08.336]  And this is, I'm sure, precisely why this has happened.
[00:59:08.336 --> 00:59:09.397]  Thank you for that update, Rose.
[00:59:09.397 --> 00:59:10.377]  You're more than welcome to hang.
[00:59:10.377 --> 00:59:12.439]  We'll also go to Phil, Charles, Richard, and Lucas.
[00:59:12.439 --> 00:59:16.062]  Stay tuned.

[01:00:27.797 --> 01:00:37.079]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:37.079 --> 01:00:38.379]  Big Brother.
[01:00:38.379 --> 01:00:40.160]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.920]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.480]  You want answers?
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.421]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:45.421 --> 01:00:49.222]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:49.222 --> 01:00:53.283]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:55.467 --> 01:00:59.829]  You want answers, so do I. I'm Jack Blood, filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:00:59.829 --> 01:01:05.232]  Alex Jones getting to the answers by asking the right questions.
[01:01:05.232 --> 01:01:07.093]  And moving us to the right debate.
[01:01:07.093 --> 01:01:12.295]  That's extremely important, and that's the job we've been doing, though, these many years.
[01:01:12.295 --> 01:01:15.977]  I really believe 9-11 truth, truth action in general.
[01:01:17.165 --> 01:01:21.467]  A new paradigm is being built and we are heading towards critical mass.
[01:01:21.467 --> 01:01:26.649]  We are the proverbial truth snowball rolling down the hill getting bigger and bigger all the time.
[01:01:26.649 --> 01:01:31.552]  Get out of the way or you'll be run over by truth action in 9-11 truth.
[01:01:33.117 --> 01:01:34.477]  We're going to go to a few more calls here.
[01:01:34.477 --> 01:01:41.680]  I have a quick interview to do, and then we'll go back to your calls and continue to cover news today, this Monday, the 23rd of April, 2007.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.041]  Let's go to Phil in Detroit.
[01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:44.061]  Phil, thank you for holding.
[01:01:44.061 --> 01:01:45.521]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:45.521 --> 01:01:45.782]  Hi.
[01:01:45.782 --> 01:01:48.683]  What was the name that you used there?
[01:01:48.683 --> 01:01:49.703]  Conscience what?
[01:01:50.678 --> 01:01:56.523]  The judge used... Yeah, uh, conscience shock, I believe was the appropriate term.
[01:01:56.523 --> 01:01:58.685]  Conscience shocking.
[01:01:58.685 --> 01:02:00.106]  It's not conscience shocking.
[01:02:00.106 --> 01:02:04.450]  Yes, that's correct, so therefore it's not a crime if it's not conscience shocking.
[01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:05.792]  Orwellian, isn't it?
[01:02:05.792 --> 01:02:11.757]  Well, I mean, honestly, I mean, you know, when they nuke Washington because the people have come to drag these
[01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:18.611]  Criminals out in the street and hang them, is that going to be not-conscience-shocking, I guess?
[01:02:18.611 --> 01:02:22.253]  I mean, it's a semantical game, isn't it?
[01:02:22.253 --> 01:02:24.074]  What does shocking mean to the courts?
[01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.674]  What does a conscience mean to the courts?
[01:02:25.674 --> 01:02:29.016]  They don't have a conscience, so how could they even comment on this?
[01:02:29.016 --> 01:02:31.096]  This is Orwellian beyond belief.
[01:02:31.096 --> 01:02:36.699]  I mean, you can't even read a story like that without having to get out your decoder book and figure out what they're really saying.
[01:02:36.699 --> 01:02:41.741]  You know, my box of cornflakes never came with rain.
[01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:57.129]  Well, it is a total crime and it is a slap in the face to the rescue workers, the people, the residents that lived in that area that were told to go out and go shopping when the government knew that there was toxic dust floating around everywhere, okay?
[01:02:57.129 --> 01:02:58.710]  So, it is a slap in the face.
[01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:10.117]  So, not only does our government not support the troops by littering depleted uranium everywhere, but they don't support the victims of 9-11 by doing this and trying to whitewash this and cover it up.
[01:03:10.117 --> 01:03:11.518]  Again, the court doesn't have a conscience.
[01:03:11.518 --> 01:03:12.719]  They have no right to comment on it.
[01:03:12.999 --> 01:03:18.240]  Of course they didn't plant explosives in the building because of the asbestos problem.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:26.002]  I wouldn't have had anything to do with that motivation.
[01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:29.102]  We really have to get these criminals tried.
[01:03:29.102 --> 01:03:32.623]  The problem is that we're fighting against liars.
[01:03:32.623 --> 01:03:37.804]  And when you fight against liars, they use lies the way we would try to use truth.
[01:03:38.798 --> 01:03:43.361]  And, unfortunately, it looks like... The lie will set you free?
[01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:46.522]  The best way to fight lies is with lies.
[01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:51.625]  There are other lies that can be added to their lies that make their lies useless.
[01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:53.846]  I completely disagree with that, Phil.
[01:03:53.846 --> 01:03:57.568]  I don't know how you want to flesh that out, but I think the best way to fight lies is with truth.
[01:03:57.568 --> 01:03:59.710]  You know, just remember, they don't lie.
[01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:00.850]  They misspeak.
[01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:02.071]  They're not informed.
[01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:03.051]  They forget.
[01:04:03.051 --> 01:04:04.032]  Someone else did it.
[01:04:05.485 --> 01:04:09.249]  I know, but that can take forever, that process.
[01:04:09.249 --> 01:04:14.434]  In order to keep the 9-11 truth movement out there and to keep the truth... But it's working, Bill.
[01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.036]  Using the truth is working.
[01:04:16.036 --> 01:04:17.378]  Look around you.
[01:04:17.378 --> 01:04:25.947]  Of course, but sometimes you have to, I think, be a little bit creative in the way in which you go about publicizing the truth.
[01:04:26.616 --> 01:04:30.698]  And using their propaganda machines to our advantage.
[01:04:30.698 --> 01:04:32.498]  Well, here's what Rumsfeld said about that.
[01:04:32.498 --> 01:04:37.740]  Sometimes the truth is so precious, it has to be accompanied by a bodyguard of lies.
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.001]  That's a direct quote from Rummy.
[01:04:42.099 --> 01:04:43.340]  So maybe you agree with Rummy.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:43.680]  I don't know.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:56.946]  I mean, I happen to think that standing up, being bold, being personally responsible, being a good example for your friends, your neighbor, your family, your co-workers, and people on the street, and fighting the good fight on a truth level.
[01:04:56.946 --> 01:05:08.651]  Of course, as Bill Cooper used to say, there are many truths, so we can get into all that, but at the end of the day, we have to be the ones who are honest, who are truthful, who are doing our best to cut through the bodyguard of lies.
[01:05:09.432 --> 01:05:12.155]  And expose these criminals for who they really are.
[01:05:12.155 --> 01:05:15.220]  Liars, criminals, murderers, and eugenics.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.461]  We'll come right back after this, folks.
[01:05:16.461 --> 01:05:16.882]  Stay tuned.
[01:05:33.149 --> 01:05:38.414]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:05:38.414 --> 01:05:48.543]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating, our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:05:48.543 --> 01:05:51.866]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:55.309]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:05:55.629 --> 01:06:05.236]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:06:05.236 --> 01:06:08.979]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:06:08.979 --> 01:06:16.345]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:06:16.345 --> 01:06:17.766]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[01:06:17.766 --> 01:06:19.487]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:06:35.436 --> 01:06:38.958]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:41.279]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:06:41.279 --> 01:06:48.842]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:57.060]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:08.808]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:07:08.808 --> 01:07:12.771]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:07:12.771 --> 01:07:15.033]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:07:15.033 --> 01:07:18.876]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:26.903]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:37.043]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:07:37.043 --> 01:07:41.285]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:07:41.285 --> 01:07:47.828]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:07:47.828 --> 01:07:52.090]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:57.953]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.
[01:07:57.953 --> 01:08:03.635]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.
[01:08:03.635 --> 01:08:11.699]  The solar-powered generator will run your lights, fan, electric blanket, your refrigerator, and a whole slew of household items.

[01:08:32.613 --> 01:08:38.017]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:38.017 --> 01:08:42.901]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:42.901 --> 01:08:46.123]  It is a war for your mind.
[01:08:46.123 --> 01:08:47.104]  There are no days off.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:58.026]  It is a constant battle to protect your mind, to protect your pursuit of happiness, your right to freedom, your right to pursue a higher consciousness.
[01:08:58.026 --> 01:09:08.052]  And they will take that away from you and put you in a mental prison, a mental cage, if they continue to steamroll over the consciousness of the world.
[01:09:08.052 --> 01:09:08.933]  We will stop them!
[01:09:08.933 --> 01:09:17.218]  We will stop by standing up against them and by declaring that our hearts, our minds, belong to us and nobody's gonna win them!
[01:09:18.208 --> 01:09:21.813]  I don't care how much they would like to.
[01:09:21.813 --> 01:09:27.041]  Because if there's a winner in your heart and mind, there's going to be a loser, and that loser is likely to be you.
[01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:30.171]  We're going to be joined here by Joseph Kilgus.
[01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:34.492]  He is one of the people that took on John Kerry here over the weekend at Book People.
[01:09:34.492 --> 01:09:37.193]  His group is Austin 9-11 Truth Now.
[01:09:37.193 --> 01:09:41.155]  I'd just like to play the clip again, because we cut off some of it the first time we played.
[01:09:41.155 --> 01:09:48.677]  I'd like to play the whole clip of the question by Joseph to John Kerry, his answer, and then we'll come back, we'll go to Joseph, and we'll take your calls.
[01:09:48.677 --> 01:09:50.178]  Of course, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:50.178 --> 01:09:52.178]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:09:52.178 --> 01:09:55.480]  John, if you could roll that clip, we can hear how he builds up to the question.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.300]  I think he does a good job.
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:56.800]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:09:58.147 --> 01:10:00.148]  I should mention that up front every once in a while.
[01:10:00.148 --> 01:10:07.530]  I just want to commend you both for your stance on environmental issues like this that are so important.
[01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:13.132]  Chapter 2 I really got a lot out of, especially when you talked about the Environmental Working Group.
[01:10:13.132 --> 01:10:17.013]  I think we could all benefit from going to pwg.org.
[01:10:17.013 --> 01:10:18.754]  There's also a searchable database there.
[01:10:18.754 --> 01:10:24.816]  You can plug in all your personal hygiene products and see which ones are toxic to you that you're using on a daily basis.
[01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:31.799]  I think another thing that we should really focus on too is genetically modified organisms.
[01:10:31.799 --> 01:10:35.441]  Another thing, the use of depleted uranium in Iraq.
[01:10:35.441 --> 01:10:40.603]  Chemtrails being sprayed over major cities everywhere in this country daily.
[01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:43.605]  A big concern of mine because I see these things every day.
[01:10:43.605 --> 01:10:44.505]  What is it?
[01:10:44.505 --> 01:10:47.026]  The Air Force denies the fact that they exist.
[01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:48.587]  They think that they're irregular chemtrails.
[01:10:48.587 --> 01:10:50.928]  We know better than that.
[01:10:50.928 --> 01:10:53.349]  Also, a question I have for you.
[01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:54.230]  World Trade Center 7.
[01:10:55.231 --> 01:11:02.038]  ...was brought down on September 11th at 5.20 in the evening.
[01:11:02.038 --> 01:11:16.012]  The leaseholder of the World Trade Center complex, Larry Silverstein, gave a public interview on PBS in 2002, and he said that they pulled that building, which is a demolition term for intentionally breaking down a building.
[01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:21.330]  This man made over five billion dollars from those buildings' destruction.
[01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:32.076]  And I want to know if there was ever a formal investigation into Larry Silverstein, the leaseholder of the World Trade Center Complex, and his ties to this entire event.
[01:11:32.076 --> 01:11:34.058]  I don't believe there's been a formal investigation.
[01:11:34.058 --> 01:11:34.858]  I haven't heard that.
[01:11:34.858 --> 01:11:35.639]  I don't know that.
[01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:46.185]  I do know that that wall, I remember, was in danger, and I think that they made a decision based on the danger that it had of destroying everything, so they did it in a controlled fashion.
[01:11:47.353 --> 01:11:52.938]  Uh, you know, he's part of the construction, reconstruction effort for the memorial and the use of the land, etc.
[01:11:52.938 --> 01:11:56.021]  There's been a long tug-of-war going on in New York.
[01:11:56.021 --> 01:12:01.226]  I am not following every aspect of it because it's not in my jurisdiction, so to speak.
[01:12:01.226 --> 01:12:03.449]  But I'll check on what the story is.
[01:12:03.449 --> 01:12:06.111]  I'll take a look at it, based on what you've said.
[01:12:06.111 --> 01:12:06.732]  You're the first people
[01:12:09.346 --> 01:12:09.847]  Let me find out about it.
[01:12:09.847 --> 01:12:11.389]  I don't know enough about it.
[01:12:11.389 --> 01:12:13.011]  It's not in our book, etc.
[01:12:13.011 --> 01:12:14.933]  Incidentally, thank you for mentioning.
[01:12:14.933 --> 01:12:16.756]  If you go to the back of the book, folks,
[01:12:24.326 --> 01:12:26.087]  It's not in our book.
[01:12:26.087 --> 01:12:32.350]  I kind of doubt it would have been in his book, but we have Joseph Kilgus from Austin 9-11 Truth Now.
[01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:34.931]  You can get them on MySpace by entering that in.
[01:12:34.931 --> 01:12:36.712]  Joseph, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:12:36.712 --> 01:12:44.555]  Congratulations here in Austin, Texas on being the first people to ask Skull & Bonesman John Kerry these questions.
[01:12:44.555 --> 01:12:45.275]  Well, hi, Jack.
[01:12:45.275 --> 01:12:45.936]  Thank you.
[01:12:45.936 --> 01:12:50.818]  Yeah, I mean, it's pretty shocking to hear him say that, that a prominent U.S.
[01:12:51.591 --> 01:13:01.839]  Senator and someone who ran for president in 2004 saying that he hadn't heard anything about 9-11 being an inside job or that it was pulled off by a controlled demolition.
[01:13:01.839 --> 01:13:02.800]  It's just shocking.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:11.686]  What is the feeling you got when they were asked first the first part question by one of your colleagues referring to the work of Dr. Stephen Jones and then your follow-up question.
[01:13:11.686 --> 01:13:20.113]  Can you explain to the audience, I think they have to see this video, to see them squirming and then nodding and then the little look of shock on Teresa Hines' face when she realizes
[01:13:20.433 --> 01:13:20.934]  We're good to go.
[01:13:32.839 --> 01:13:33.219]  Sure.
[01:13:33.219 --> 01:13:46.783]  Well, first off, we were sitting in a whole group of at least 100 people in that small room upstairs, most of which are Democrats, so they're kind of more of a liberal bent anyway, and their minds are a little bit more open.
[01:13:46.783 --> 01:13:49.744]  We could tell by the rabid applause just where they were coming from.
[01:13:49.744 --> 01:13:51.785]  It was a hostile environment, to say the least.
[01:13:51.785 --> 01:13:53.906]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:13:53.906 --> 01:13:57.227]  But when Michelle got up and asked that first question,
[01:13:58.067 --> 01:14:05.310]  Yeah, their body gestures and the way that they presented themselves, you can't hear it on the audio, but you can see it on the video.
[01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:07.951]  They were very uncomfortable by the question.
[01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:24.797]  When Michelle was asking the first question about the dust, you could see on Theresa's face that she thought she understood where the question was going related to the EPA's admission that the air at World Trade Center was okay to breathe within a couple of days after the event.
[01:14:25.579 --> 01:14:33.383]  I thought she thought we were going in that direction, and then Michelle brought up the actual thermate question there.
[01:14:33.383 --> 01:14:36.004]  Yeah, the look on their face was astonishment.
[01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:44.408]  They couldn't believe that they were being asked this at their own book signing, but you can see that they were caught off guard in an unscripted moment, which was great.
[01:14:44.408 --> 01:14:52.972]  Well, hopefully, Joseph, it won't be the last time as well, because I really now see more and more people doing this and really confronting these people.
[01:14:54.888 --> 01:15:00.349]  I guess we found out now that the Emperor has no clothes and people are pointing at them and saying, hey, you're naked.
[01:15:00.349 --> 01:15:02.609]  And they're looking at themselves going, well, we're not naked.
[01:15:02.609 --> 01:15:04.410]  We haven't heard anything about being naked.
[01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:06.830]  That's, of course, just a metaphor to try to explain this.
[01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:13.671]  Kerry making some very bizarre hand gestures, nervous, contained hand gestures as he's hearing out these questions.
[01:15:13.671 --> 01:15:20.593]  Now, the headline I saw today accompanying your video was that John Kerry admitted that this is a controlled demolition.
[01:15:20.593 --> 01:15:23.253]  Do you believe that that was what his answer broke down to?
[01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:27.476]  I don't think that's an accurate summation of what he said.
[01:15:27.476 --> 01:15:31.083]  In fact, his exact words were brought down in a controlled fashion.
[01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:34.730]  I think he specifically avoided using that phrase.
[01:15:36.934 --> 01:15:40.098]  Come to think about it a little bit after the fact here.
[01:15:40.098 --> 01:15:49.331]  It seems like he might be talking about World Trade Center 6 and the wall there in that building and not specifically World Trade Center 7.
[01:15:49.331 --> 01:15:54.558]  I don't know if that's a saving, saves him at all because I think that any United States Senator
[01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:55.679]  We're good to go.
[01:16:15.526 --> 01:16:24.746]  You know, I don't think that he was saying it was controlled demolition, but certainly his knowledge of it is, I think, a lot more than what he let on.
[01:16:25.635 --> 01:16:29.397]  Yeah, I mean, in some ways he's guilty for obfuscation.
[01:16:29.397 --> 01:16:31.439]  He's guilty for trying to deflect the question.
[01:16:31.439 --> 01:16:49.790]  He certainly had no intention in answering directly the, I think, very succinct question that you asked, and that by deflecting it into something discussing the memorial, rather than Larry Silverstein, Pollitt, and of course the scientific evidence we had, it almost, in a way, is damning in and of itself, no?
[01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:50.810]  Yeah, oh, totally.
[01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:52.171]  I mean, I entirely agree with you.
[01:16:52.171 --> 01:16:53.412]  He did deflect the question,
[01:16:53.843 --> 01:17:11.904]  And he went on to say, well, you know, this man is involved with the Reconstruction, like that somehow is, you know, saving grace for him because he somehow is involved in the Reconstruction and that just somehow cancels out the fact that he may have been involved in an insurance scam or the loss of life of American citizens here on our own soil.
[01:17:11.904 --> 01:17:12.405]  It's just sick.
[01:17:12.884 --> 01:17:17.727]  Give me the feeling in the room with the Democrats you were surrounded with.
[01:17:17.727 --> 01:17:19.728]  Did they come up to you after the event?
[01:17:19.728 --> 01:17:22.510]  Did they say anything to you guys about asking these questions?
[01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:23.450]  Were you mocked?
[01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:26.392]  I mean, what exactly was the situation there?
[01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:26.792]  Actually, no.
[01:17:26.792 --> 01:17:27.813]  It was very tame.
[01:17:27.813 --> 01:17:30.855]  I think that you can't really hear it on the audio.
[01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:38.179]  When I asked that question, and I tell him that this man made $5 billion from these buildings' destruction, you could hear
[01:17:39.176 --> 01:17:39.976]  I don't know.
[01:17:39.976 --> 01:17:40.537]  I don't think so.
[01:18:05.028 --> 01:18:05.650]  Good for you.
[01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:06.454]  Get them going in.
[01:18:06.454 --> 01:18:07.297]  Get them coming out.
[01:18:07.297 --> 01:18:08.542]  Get them while they're sitting there.
[01:18:09.682 --> 01:18:19.068]  With their mouths agape, looking at the great John Kerry, who they probably supported as skull and bones candidate B in the 2004 selection process.
[01:18:19.068 --> 01:18:27.013]  Reporting for duty, John Kerry wanted to, he was in favor of escalating the situation over there, in favor of staying there.
[01:18:27.013 --> 01:18:33.117]  Of course, this is one of the things we know, and this is how, there's really no difference between the Republicans and the Democrats.
[01:18:33.117 --> 01:18:34.117]  Now, tell me the truth.
[01:18:34.117 --> 01:18:38.060]  Did you actually read his book, or did you just skim it in order to set up that question?
[01:18:38.937 --> 01:18:43.683]  Yeah, truthfully, I skimmed that they're sitting there for about an hour waiting to ask him that question.
[01:18:43.683 --> 01:18:53.854]  So I did skim that and found a little bit of knowledge that I already knew about and kind of used that to try to bait him in a little bit and make him feel comfortable before I launched into my real questions.
[01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:57.619]  You know, I brought up questions about chemtrails and depleted uranium.
[01:18:57.619 --> 01:18:58.400]  What you can't see
[01:18:58.982 --> 01:19:04.524]  By hearing the audio, is that he's sitting there shaking his head, nodding his head to everything that I'm saying about Chemtrails.
[01:19:04.524 --> 01:19:11.027]  It seemed like him and Teresa Hines, Kerry, were both nodding in agreement when you were talking about Chemtrails.
[01:19:11.027 --> 01:19:19.871]  And then I think you got to a point where you were talking Contrails versus Chemtrails, and she particularly looked a little bit shocked when you got to the base of your question there.
[01:19:20.618 --> 01:19:21.279]  Yeah.
[01:19:21.279 --> 01:19:25.442]  Her whole demeanor, I thought, was just kind of odd.
[01:19:25.442 --> 01:19:31.346]  When she walked up to the podium at the beginning, she seemed just very out of it and her hair was all tousled.
[01:19:31.346 --> 01:19:33.588]  She's on massive medication.
[01:19:33.588 --> 01:19:35.490]  Can you tell that by looking at her?
[01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:37.531]  She takes such a myriad of medication.
[01:19:37.531 --> 01:19:44.517]  Uppers, downers, the whole nine yards, prescription medication, and probably antidepressant as well.
[01:19:44.517 --> 01:19:45.978]  She really looks that way.
[01:19:45.978 --> 01:19:49.561]  Of course, she lost it a couple of times in the 2004 elections, which didn't help
[01:19:50.101 --> 01:19:51.002]  Not that I saw Jack, no.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:17.803]  Well, you know, he gave us the outlet to come to him and give him information and evidence regarding 9-11.
[01:20:17.803 --> 01:20:21.584]  Hold on, I want to bring you back for a little bit on the other side of the segment and tell people about your organization.

[01:21:50.623 --> 01:21:54.266]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:21:54.266 --> 01:21:57.368]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:21:57.368 --> 01:22:06.774]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:22:06.774 --> 01:22:12.058]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:22:12.538 --> 01:22:14.861]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:22:14.861 --> 01:22:17.684]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.

[01:22:33.459 --> 01:22:40.201]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:22:40.201 --> 01:22:44.481]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:22:44.481 --> 01:22:46.982]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:22:46.982 --> 01:22:54.324]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:22:54.324 --> 01:22:57.204]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[01:22:57.204 --> 01:23:00.665]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.

[01:23:33.406 --> 01:23:34.626]  How are you feeling today?

[01:25:07.418 --> 01:25:10.265]  The Alex Jones Show, Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:25:10.265 --> 01:25:12.330]  On the line with us, Joseph Kilgus.
[01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:14.897]  He's part of the group here in Austin that
[01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:20.731]  Protests in front of the Statehouse every Saturday from 1 o'clock to 5 p.m.
[01:25:20.731 --> 01:25:21.811]  here Central Time.
[01:25:21.811 --> 01:25:24.592]  Rain, shine, snow, extreme heat.
[01:25:24.592 --> 01:25:26.272]  They're out there with their signs.
[01:25:26.272 --> 01:25:31.454]  They're out there talking to people, handing out videos, and it would be great if you get out and join them.
[01:25:31.454 --> 01:25:38.976]  If you're here in Austin, Texas, or you want to drive in and see how these things work, a Truth Action Squad like this operates, come down and join us.
[01:25:38.976 --> 01:25:39.517]  Join them.
[01:25:39.517 --> 01:25:40.497]  I've gone down myself.
[01:25:41.492 --> 01:25:47.838]  for the Saturday protest every Saturday like clockwork rain or shine starts at one o'clock goes to five o'clock p.m.
[01:25:47.838 --> 01:26:03.412]  if you want to find out more about the Austin 9-11 truth now you can go to myspace.com slash 9-11 Austin 9-11 truth now you can just Google Austin 9-11 truth now take you right over there myspace they're hooked up one of my friends on my myspace
[01:26:04.379 --> 01:26:06.680]  Joseph, I really admire the work you guys are doing.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.901]  I know you were inspired somewhat by Luke Radowski over in New York and the great work that they're doing.
[01:26:11.901 --> 01:26:13.801]  We can't commend you more.
[01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:17.702]  Also, the Dallas 9-11 Truth Group is really starting to pick up some speed.
[01:26:17.702 --> 01:26:22.423]  The Tulsa 9-11 Truth Group is just doing amazing things with truth actions.
[01:26:22.423 --> 01:26:30.665]  I mean, talk about how important it is to have a presence on a regular basis for people to always find and have and what you're doing getting the word out for 9-11 Truth.
[01:26:32.546 --> 01:26:44.490]  Yeah, I think it's just entirely important that everyone do as much as they possibly can locally and to see these groups pop up across the United States and in different cities is just awesome.
[01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:46.651]  I think that everybody needs to get involved.
[01:26:46.651 --> 01:26:55.414]  Our little group each week gives people here in the Austin area, we do have people come from Dallas and other areas, an outlet to express
[01:26:56.034 --> 01:26:56.855]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:27:17.105 --> 01:27:25.531]  I went down there the weekend during South by Southwest and really got a taste for what you guys do down there.
[01:27:25.531 --> 01:27:33.957]  All the support, the people driving by honking and raising their fists and yelling in support far diminishes the people that are giving you the finger.
[01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:35.077]  I guess that happens too.
[01:27:36.338 --> 01:27:41.941]  It's really bold of you guys to do it, and I just hope people all over the country are doing this, Joseph.
[01:27:41.941 --> 01:27:43.582]  It really is very effective.
[01:27:43.582 --> 01:27:52.747]  If people can't join you out there, obviously they can contribute or donate to your cause so you can get more DVDs to hand out and even spread the word on a bigger way.
[01:27:53.832 --> 01:27:54.212]  Absolutely.
[01:27:54.212 --> 01:27:59.274]  I also want to thank Webster Tarpley last week for the inspiration for this.
[01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:06.316]  Michelle and I spoke with him after the protest there at UT, and he kind of mentioned some ways that we could do this.
[01:28:06.316 --> 01:28:11.638]  So it's kind of at his urging and certainly his inspiration to go out there and do this.
[01:28:11.638 --> 01:28:18.120]  But I think that, you know, if all of us get out there and do more things like this, it's going to raise the question, what's really important about this?
[01:28:18.519 --> 01:28:20.440]  It's that they keep on bringing up 9-11.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:29.747]  It is the pretext for so much that they're doing in our country and abroad right now that as long as they're bringing it up, you better believe that we're going to bring it up and we're going to demand it.
[01:28:29.747 --> 01:28:33.569]  Yeah, I mean that's why when John Kerry says it's not under his jurisdiction, he's a U.S.
[01:28:33.569 --> 01:28:34.590]  Senator.
[01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:35.691]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:42.264]  And a senator from Massachusetts, or TX, where a lot of this came from on 9-11.
[01:28:42.264 --> 01:28:44.766]  I mean, he was responsible for part of this.
[01:28:44.766 --> 01:28:48.029]  So to say it's not in his jurisdiction is, well, should we call it what it is?
[01:28:48.029 --> 01:28:48.629]  It's a lie?
[01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:50.991]  Or does he just not know any better?
[01:28:50.991 --> 01:28:56.715]  Well, these are the people that we charge, you know, give them responsibility to levy war against other countries.
[01:28:56.715 --> 01:29:03.280]  And if they don't have all the facts, and they're not investigating fully, you know, a crime scene as big as 9-11, Ground Zero,
[01:29:05.321 --> 01:29:08.724]  I know you don't buy that, Joseph.
[01:29:08.724 --> 01:29:09.544]  I don't buy it.
[01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:11.346]  Michelle, your partner, doesn't buy it.
[01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:13.127]  None of the listeners here buy this.
[01:29:13.127 --> 01:29:17.190]  Of course, it's an obfuscation, and this is how they deflect these questions.
[01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:22.854]  But the more they go out and the more they're confronted with this, the more they're going to understand exactly what they're up against.
[01:29:22.854 --> 01:29:25.435]  And I think 9-11 Truth is going critical mass.
[01:29:25.435 --> 01:29:27.357]  This will probably really get to a head with the
[01:29:27.837 --> 01:29:29.538]  You know what, I can't say that anyone did.
[01:29:29.538 --> 01:29:32.201]  We certainly didn't have any DVDs on us at the time, so we didn't
[01:29:49.132 --> 01:29:55.617]  But I want to thank Terry from Be Real Productions and also Aaron Dooley who filmed this entire thing.
[01:29:55.617 --> 01:29:59.140]  A couple of hardcore patriots that join us every week out there at the Capitol.
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:29:59.861]  No fear!
[01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:02.263]  You guys have absolutely no fear.
[01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:05.405]  You are bold and mighty forces have come to your aid.
[01:30:05.405 --> 01:30:07.287]  They are off to 9-11 Truth now.
[01:30:07.287 --> 01:30:08.547]  Go join them folks on Saturday.
[01:30:08.547 --> 01:30:09.989]  We'll come right back with your calls right after this.
[01:30:09.989 --> 01:30:10.369]  Stay tuned.
[01:30:23.141 --> 01:30:24.522]  We're on the march.
[01:30:24.522 --> 01:30:26.143]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:26.143 --> 01:30:33.066]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:33.066 --> 01:30:37.588]  Everyone knows we need calcium and magnesium every day for the support of strong bones.
[01:30:37.588 --> 01:30:42.451]  But most of us are only taking one source of calcium supplementation and one source of magnesium.
[01:30:42.451 --> 01:30:50.855]  That just simply isn't enough to give your body the proper nutrition it needs to help keep bones and teeth strong, prevent osteoporosis, and support muscle function.
[01:30:51.175 --> 01:30:55.977]  Now discover the most advanced calcium and magnesium supplement on the market today.
[01:30:55.977 --> 01:30:57.938]  Select-Cal 1000.
[01:30:57.938 --> 01:31:06.522]  From the folks who brought you Wachter Sea Vegetation, Select-Cal 1000 contains 7, that's 7 sources of calcium and 4 sources of magnesium.
[01:31:06.522 --> 01:31:11.004]  Wachter's Select-Cal 1000 is also packed with other important vitamins and minerals.
[01:31:11.004 --> 01:31:13.845]  And of course, Wachter's special blend of sea vegetation.
[01:31:14.105 --> 01:31:16.547]  Try finding that in your ordinary calcium supplement.

[01:31:25.095 --> 01:31:29.059]  That's W-A-C-H-T-E-R-S dot com.
[01:31:29.059 --> 01:31:29.439]  Or call 1-800-682-7100.
[01:31:32.825 --> 01:31:37.786]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:31:37.786 --> 01:31:41.047]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:31:41.047 --> 01:31:43.968]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:31:43.968 --> 01:31:49.170]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:54.851]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:31:54.851 --> 01:31:57.812]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:31:57.992 --> 01:31:58.573]  We're good to go.
[01:32:21.394 --> 01:32:26.879]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:32:26.879 --> 01:32:27.320]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:32:33.621 --> 01:32:37.744]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:32:37.744 --> 01:32:41.968]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[01:32:41.968 --> 01:32:47.272]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[01:32:47.272 --> 01:32:58.461]  Electrolyzed plus water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[01:32:58.641 --> 01:32:59.281]  We're good to go!
[01:33:18.392 --> 01:33:20.672]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio
[01:33:48.991 --> 01:33:55.373]  George Strait was singin' Seashores of Old Mexico.
[01:33:55.373 --> 01:33:59.654]  It sounded so good, I got an idea.
[01:33:59.654 --> 01:34:04.235]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[01:34:04.235 --> 01:34:11.057]  Longstar State should be renamed Texico.
[01:34:11.057 --> 01:34:13.537]  So long, Texas.
[01:34:13.537 --> 01:34:15.378]  Hello, Mexico.
[01:34:18.593 --> 01:34:26.502]  I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso.
[01:34:26.502 --> 01:34:28.144]  I'm leaving tonight.
[01:34:28.144 --> 01:34:30.306]  I ain't gonna pack.
[01:34:30.306 --> 01:34:34.151]  I'm only taking the clothes on my back.
[01:34:34.151 --> 01:34:36.133]  So long, Texas.
[01:34:36.133 --> 01:34:38.035]  Hello, Mexico.
[01:34:48.528 --> 01:34:56.172]  I'll drive a rattle-trap car with no liability.
[01:34:56.172 --> 01:35:00.675]  I'll demand equal rights, though I'm there illegally.
[01:35:02.532 --> 01:35:04.414]  Just a lot more news to report today.
[01:35:04.414 --> 01:35:05.715]  We do want to take your calls.
[01:35:05.715 --> 01:35:07.657]  Monday is always a serious news day.
[01:35:07.657 --> 01:35:12.080]  There is so much to report, including an article up on Infowars.com.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:18.066]  Police prepared to arrest 3,000 at the 2008 Republican National Convention.
[01:35:18.066 --> 01:35:20.608]  This will exceed, I believe, almost double
[01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:25.272]  What happened in New York City in 2004.
[01:35:25.272 --> 01:35:26.853]  Of course, we were on the ground for that.
[01:35:26.853 --> 01:35:31.235]  Another story, a student arrested over Virginia Tech remarks.
[01:35:31.235 --> 01:35:41.681]  Of course, the thought police already closing in on people that would even hint at any type of sympathy for the shooter or even taken out of context that that could be the case.
[01:35:41.681 --> 01:35:45.863]  So we are going to be seeing a total onslaught on potential thought crimes as
[01:35:46.423 --> 01:35:58.947]  The hate legislation moves forward, hate crimes bills move forward, and this Virginia Tech thing becomes a cyclone of psychological interpretations and interpretations of your behavior.
[01:35:58.947 --> 01:36:01.187]  Just one of the many components of the Virginia Tech shooting.
[01:36:01.187 --> 01:36:02.868]  We have more information on that on the show as well.
[01:36:02.868 --> 01:36:04.028]  But I want to go right back to your calls.
[01:36:04.028 --> 01:36:04.208]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:36:04.208 --> 01:36:05.828]  Do we still have Charles in Louisiana?
[01:36:08.712 --> 01:36:10.293]  Charles, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:36:10.293 --> 01:36:10.993]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:36:10.993 --> 01:36:11.754]  How are you doing?
[01:36:11.754 --> 01:36:12.594]  My name is Jack.
[01:36:12.594 --> 01:36:13.175]  I'm just fine.
[01:36:13.175 --> 01:36:13.495]  Thank you.
[01:36:13.495 --> 01:36:17.497]  Well, I'm not going to mention nothing about the truck rally today.
[01:36:17.497 --> 01:36:18.618]  Not many people talk about it.
[01:36:18.618 --> 01:36:23.941]  Well, we covered it on Friday, on the Friday program, and it's a big deal, but this is supposed to be happening today.
[01:36:23.941 --> 01:36:27.583]  Have you heard any... Oh, yeah, I heard a lot, but I just wanted to know.
[01:36:27.583 --> 01:36:30.645]  I've been going through all the channels, and very few people have mentioned everything.
[01:36:30.645 --> 01:36:31.786]  Some more, you know.
[01:36:31.786 --> 01:36:33.587]  I mean, people... What are you seeing, Charles?
[01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:34.728]  What are the numbers?
[01:36:34.728 --> 01:36:37.850]  Are we seeing... Well, I've got a guy with a CD down.
[01:36:39.277 --> 01:36:46.162]  About 40 minutes ago, I'm getting a few reports that they're pulling trucks from the side and kicking them.
[01:36:46.162 --> 01:36:46.583]  Sure.
[01:36:46.583 --> 01:36:51.566]  Department of Public Safety and State Police, I'm getting these reports.
[01:36:51.566 --> 01:36:56.349]  And then where the trucks are parked at, you know where they usually park, they only have four right now.
[01:36:56.349 --> 01:37:00.592]  And in Idaho, it's about a fourth of the trucks are off the road.
[01:37:00.592 --> 01:37:02.114]  So it's just starting to build up right now.
[01:37:02.114 --> 01:37:03.935]  But like I said, it just started 40 minutes ago.
[01:37:04.651 --> 01:37:16.261]  Sure, and of course we can assume, Charles, there'll be mass arrests, mass tickets, mass fines levied at these truckers standing up for their right to be paid appropriately for shipping our goods?
[01:37:16.261 --> 01:37:21.625]  No, it's because they're bringing 17,000 illegal trucks here from Mexico, that's why this is being done.
[01:37:21.625 --> 01:37:26.289]  Well, I know, but that cuts into their livelihood, and that's why they're upset about it.
[01:37:26.289 --> 01:37:32.874]  I've heard of two, one of the truck drivers, I've been passing his flyers out, George Bush is getting ready to bring 25,000 Iraqis here.
[01:37:35.069 --> 01:37:35.870]  That's going to be good.
[01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:41.133]  I think they already did that back in 1990 after the first Gulf War.
[01:37:41.133 --> 01:37:43.395]  This is another deal he's talking about.
[01:37:43.395 --> 01:37:45.317]  $25,000 more.
[01:37:45.317 --> 01:37:47.438]  Well, American people, they're going to have to get hungry.
[01:37:47.438 --> 01:37:49.540]  They're going to have to do something, Mr. Jack.
[01:37:51.187 --> 01:37:54.309]  Well, I think, you know, maybe this is what it's going to take, Charlie.
[01:37:54.309 --> 01:37:59.451]  I hope it isn't because I see people waking up without having the rug pulled completely out from underneath them.
[01:37:59.451 --> 01:38:02.512]  But that is what it's going to take for some people.
[01:38:02.512 --> 01:38:04.353]  Well, some people will never do nothing, you know.
[01:38:04.353 --> 01:38:06.014]  They'll wait for other people to do it.
[01:38:07.399 --> 01:38:20.529]  Well, until their 2.2 cars are confiscated from the bank, until they lose their house, until they have trouble feeding their family, until they have to sign up for a no-work list, or they're denied work for whatever reason.
[01:38:20.529 --> 01:38:22.451]  Well, you know, we just get what we deserve, Mr. Jack.
[01:38:22.451 --> 01:38:23.212]  I keep seeing that.
[01:38:23.212 --> 01:38:24.372]  It's true.
[01:38:24.372 --> 01:38:27.675]  Most people, they've got a coffin somewhere and they don't want to get out of it.
[01:38:27.675 --> 01:38:30.217]  But anyway, I learned so much passing these flyers out.
[01:38:30.217 --> 01:38:35.141]  There wasn't many people out there doing it, but I had about four people with me, and we went out there for three days.
[01:38:37.178 --> 01:38:51.723]  Well, I mean, we need to get news.
[01:38:51.723 --> 01:38:59.826]  The thing is, I've gone online, and just as you mentioned when you came in, there seems to be almost a news blackout, an establishment news blackout on today's truckout.
[01:39:00.838 --> 01:39:03.218]  So we need to get news from the listeners.
[01:39:03.218 --> 01:39:06.159]  If people are out there, like you said, you're monitoring CB.
[01:39:06.159 --> 01:39:16.981]  If people are able to get us news and to report, you know, because we're somewhat isolated here in the studio, report to us exactly what the numbers are and what could be going on, any potential arrests.
[01:39:16.981 --> 01:39:20.441]  We'd like to report that live as a breaking news story on the program, Charles.
[01:39:20.441 --> 01:39:23.762]  Yeah, and Mr. Jack, I want to say you're excellent.
[01:39:23.762 --> 01:39:24.742]  You're excellent with the news.
[01:39:24.742 --> 01:39:26.982]  I mean, you really put it on the line like it is.
[01:39:26.982 --> 01:39:29.923]  And I have to tell you, I don't call in much anymore.
[01:39:31.921 --> 01:39:38.165]  Well, we all remember your great reports from Hurricane Katrina, and you're a great truth warrior.
[01:39:38.165 --> 01:39:43.148]  I know you're a great supporter of Alex Jones and Infowars, and we really love having you out there, Charles.
[01:39:43.148 --> 01:39:44.389]  Keep the faith, brother.
[01:39:44.389 --> 01:39:45.710]  I love you all, too, though.
[01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:46.550]  Keep the faith, brother.
[01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:47.511]  I know you will.
[01:39:47.511 --> 01:39:49.152]  Let's go to Richard in Texas.
[01:39:49.152 --> 01:39:50.553]  Richard, are you standing by?
[01:39:50.553 --> 01:39:51.614]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:51.614 --> 01:39:54.976]  I just wanted to make a comment about the John Kerry thing.
[01:39:55.336 --> 01:40:00.680]  You know, his comment about that being a controlled situation is just outrageous.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.243]  I mean, one, where would he have gotten that information from?
[01:40:04.243 --> 01:40:09.867]  And how in the world can he expect that to be accepted as a logical comeback?
[01:40:09.867 --> 01:40:11.148]  And where does he figure
[01:40:11.775 --> 01:40:17.481]  The opportunity was to wire that building up with explosives and that sort of thing to bring it down.
[01:40:17.481 --> 01:40:19.443]  Well, and I think that's what he was referring to.
[01:40:19.443 --> 01:40:26.731]  And if you look, you know, at the coverage from this, I think it's completely fair to say that he was alluding to a controlled demolition.
[01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:27.792]  So I don't want to sound like
[01:40:28.513 --> 01:40:31.316]  I'm in any way, you know, being contradictory here.
[01:40:31.316 --> 01:40:32.837]  I mean, I don't know what it says.
[01:40:32.837 --> 01:40:34.579]  I'm only here asking questions.
[01:40:34.579 --> 01:40:43.209]  So, initially, I believe there's good merit to this story that he is alluding to a controlled demolition regarding the Building 7.
[01:40:43.209 --> 01:40:48.674]  But I just think he got caught in a completely unaware position, and this is something we have to just...
[01:40:49.315 --> 01:40:51.397]  I don't think we can have a conclusion to this story yet.
[01:40:51.397 --> 01:40:59.503]  We have to really look at every single word he said, how he said it, to try to interpret exactly, you know, how he's skirting around and moving around here.
[01:40:59.503 --> 01:41:02.866]  So, I'm not, you know, giving anyone my conclusion here.
[01:41:02.866 --> 01:41:05.568]  I'm certainly not trying to be contradictory to some early reports.
[01:41:05.568 --> 01:41:12.054]  I believe that that's what he was alluding to, but there is kind of some wiggle room in there for him, I think.
[01:41:12.054 --> 01:41:17.018]  I understand, but I sure would have loved to have been there to deliver a follow-up question with regard to that, you know?
[01:41:17.498 --> 01:41:25.980]  Well, you heard they tried to do it, and he shut it down and immediately started trying to promote his book and tried to get everybody to get his book, so he changed the subject, he skirted the issue.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:32.662]  But somewhere in that audio, I think there is some damning information that we need to continue to follow up on.
[01:41:32.662 --> 01:41:37.724]  So again, the story is breaking, and I think it is fair to say that that's what he was alluding to.
[01:41:38.584 --> 01:41:42.907]  He kind of caught himself part way there, and then tried to change the subject.
[01:41:42.907 --> 01:41:50.132]  So, it's very complex, and this just happened this morning, so I personally am trying to figure this out and decode it live on the air.
[01:41:50.132 --> 01:41:54.915]  This is never an easy thing to do, especially in front of millions of people on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:54.915 --> 01:42:01.880]  But there are a lot of different ways to look at this, and I think it is fair to say that he's saying it's a controlled demolition.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.302]  But again, very complex, don't you think, Richard?
[01:42:04.882 --> 01:42:06.583]  Absolutely.
[01:42:06.583 --> 01:42:15.687]  That's why I hope this can be followed up and we can get him to elaborate on what his meaning was.
[01:42:15.687 --> 01:42:20.690]  You may have mentioned this earlier, but apparently Rosie's back on track with having
[01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:26.613]  9-11 first responders on the view on Wednesday, which should be pretty interesting if that doesn't get knocked off.
[01:42:26.613 --> 01:42:30.796]  If there isn't another mass school shooting before now and now and then.
[01:42:30.796 --> 01:42:32.057]  Well, thank you for the call, Richard.
[01:42:32.057 --> 01:42:35.779]  And again, these people need to be commended for taking it to Kerry.
[01:42:35.779 --> 01:42:41.822]  So I hope when he goes to his next stump speech, you'll ask the follow-up questions that need to be asked.
[01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:43.043]  I think that would be important.
[01:42:43.043 --> 01:42:45.004]  Let's go to Lucas in Texas.
[01:42:45.004 --> 01:42:46.065]  Lucas, thank you for holding.
[01:42:46.065 --> 01:42:47.446]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:47.446 --> 01:42:48.386]  Hey, what's up, Jack?
[01:42:48.386 --> 01:42:49.647]  Thanks for taking my call, brother.
[01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:53.990]  I wanted to bring up two very important subjects.
[01:42:53.990 --> 01:43:02.373]  Two months ago, when you typed in 9-11 conspiracy into Google, you pulled up about 95% pro-9-11 conspiracy sites.
[01:43:02.373 --> 01:43:06.414]  Now you type it in, you pull up anti-conspiracy sites.
[01:43:06.414 --> 01:43:11.515]  Alex Jones' prison plan, it used to be on page number one, now it's on page number five.
[01:43:11.515 --> 01:43:13.836]  Google has done something to change everything.
[01:43:13.836 --> 01:43:15.737]  That's the first subject I wanted to bring up.
[01:43:15.737 --> 01:43:19.718]  The second subject I wanted to bring up was this thing about John Kerry.
[01:43:20.117 --> 01:43:23.439]  Let me give you a quote from the Battery Park City Authority.
[01:43:23.439 --> 01:43:34.985]  It says, due to the impacts from the World Trade Center collapse and subsequent emergency response activities, the perimeter seawall of said land suffered structural damage.
[01:43:34.985 --> 01:43:41.908]  The damage occurred at various locations of approximately one mile long seawall along the Hudson River.
[01:43:41.908 --> 01:43:45.130]  Now we go back to John Kerry's comment, where he says,
[01:43:45.649 --> 01:43:49.391]  But I do know that wall was in danger.
[01:43:49.391 --> 01:43:51.692]  He's saying the wall was in danger.
[01:43:51.692 --> 01:43:54.933]  Not anything else was in danger from the wall.
[01:43:54.933 --> 01:43:57.314]  He said the wall was in danger.
[01:43:57.314 --> 01:44:05.798]  That is where the... He's talking about they brought down building number seven because they were fearing that it would fall and knock the seawall down.
[01:44:06.317 --> 01:44:07.498]  That's what he was talking about.
[01:44:07.498 --> 01:44:08.498]  At least that's what I can tell.
[01:44:08.498 --> 01:44:16.804]  As I say, I mean, trying to interpret the cryptic skull and bones comments from John Kerry is quite a feat.
[01:44:16.804 --> 01:44:25.970]  So we need to continue to analyze this particular audio and the video and to try to figure out, and I guess in some ways we're going to be left to fill in some of the blanks, aren't we?
[01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:27.150]  Oh yeah, most definitely.
[01:44:27.150 --> 01:44:31.293]  But I mean, when he said, like I said here, he says, but I do know that wall was in danger.
[01:44:31.958 --> 01:44:32.659]  I think so.
[01:44:46.798 --> 01:44:47.838]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:44:47.838 --> 01:44:51.719]  I'm glad you came in with that, and I think that's something that we need to further follow up on.
[01:44:51.719 --> 01:44:55.640]  I'm sure there's going to be more and more news on this particular story.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:03.762]  I mean, it's not often that we get John Kerry on the record for 9-11, so again, these people need to be commended, and we need to really try to get in here and decode exactly what he said.
[01:45:03.762 --> 01:45:04.823]  That was a good contribution.
[01:45:04.823 --> 01:45:05.843]  Thank you for the call.
[01:45:05.843 --> 01:45:07.043]  Let's go to Ron in New York.
[01:45:07.043 --> 01:45:07.923]  Ron, are you still with us?
[01:45:07.923 --> 01:45:09.284]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:45:09.284 --> 01:45:10.004]  Hi, Jack.
[01:45:10.004 --> 01:45:11.804]  Jack, I'm going to touch on two subjects.
[01:45:11.804 --> 01:45:14.245]  The first one I've touched on before, and I'd like to
[01:45:15.063 --> 01:45:27.733]  Admonish your listeners to call, not just their representatives, but the NRA, particularly those listeners that are members of the NRA, and tell them to withdraw support of H.R.
[01:45:27.733 --> 01:45:28.454]  297.
[01:45:28.454 --> 01:45:42.405]  That's the bill that's now floating through Congress, being spearheaded by the incident at Virginia Tech, and that it is not wise for us to be on the same side of a legislative issue
[01:45:43.286 --> 01:45:48.134]  That is being spearheaded by Carolyn McCarthy and Charles Schumer.
[01:45:48.134 --> 01:45:58.190]  And I would implore your listeners, particularly those who are NRA members, to call the NRA and tell them that they should reconsider that poor judgment of error in support of that.
[01:45:59.099 --> 01:46:01.360]  That's a nice way to say it, Ron, I guess.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.041]  That's a nice way.
[01:46:02.041 --> 01:46:07.924]  Well, I think FCC regulations might forbid me from saying it the way passions may want to.
[01:46:07.924 --> 01:46:14.727]  Yes, but I mean, you know, 297 is the most draconian of all the new McCarthy gun bills, and there are plenty of them to have to fight.
[01:46:14.727 --> 01:46:22.712]  I mean, it's, I guess, somewhat smart of them to put out so many bills that we don't even know what to fight, but I'd start with 297.
[01:46:22.712 --> 01:46:23.432]  I agree with you.
[01:46:23.432 --> 01:46:24.833]  Definitely start with 297.
[01:46:24.833 --> 01:46:25.393]  That's correct.
[01:46:27.327 --> 01:46:29.868]  It's such a bad bill that I'm going to be quite honest with you.
[01:46:29.868 --> 01:46:44.996]  While I have an abiding concern for the Second Amendment rights, I am more concerned where it relates to 297 with 14th Amendment rights of due process and Fourth Amendment rights against search and seizure and privacy.
[01:46:44.996 --> 01:46:49.098]  It'll actually chew those two amendments apart even more.
[01:46:49.098 --> 01:46:56.001]  So that is a comprehensively dangerous bill to at least three of your fundamental constitutional rights.
[01:46:56.841 --> 01:46:58.962]  So I implore people to do as I say.
[01:46:58.962 --> 01:47:12.726]  And look, if you voted for Republicans or you supported the Republicans or the Conservatives because they were going to protect your right to keep and bear arms, you better put a lot of pressure on them to stand up to this or tell them they will never have your support ever again.
[01:47:12.726 --> 01:47:14.446]  And that includes the NRA.
[01:47:14.446 --> 01:47:18.107]  And that leads to the next thing that I was going to talk about.
[01:47:18.107 --> 01:47:24.909]  We now see hucksters from the so-called psychiatric professional community, the psychologists, psychologists,
[01:47:25.612 --> 01:47:34.518]  On TV, particularly Fox, and, well, I believe that the establishment media, all of it, smells like a dead fish.
[01:47:34.518 --> 01:47:40.182]  Fox is particularly pernicious, and they are particularly pernicious for this reason.
[01:47:40.182 --> 01:47:51.850]  They wrap pseudo-Trotskyism in pseudo-populism, and then project it out to a largely uninformed and ignorant public, and make you think it's conservatism.
[01:47:51.850 --> 01:47:54.032]  Well, folks, it is not conservatism.
[01:47:54.648 --> 01:47:59.991]  They are particularly pernicious in the way they go about doing things.
[01:47:59.991 --> 01:48:10.397]  In that, have you ever noticed that Fox has experts on it that nobody has ever seen before in history prior to the establishment of the Fox Network?
[01:48:10.397 --> 01:48:21.043]  Well, if you do a lot of research on a lot of these people that they bring on as experts, you will find that a great number of them are invested, and I mean materially invested,
[01:48:21.886 --> 01:48:36.212]  In promoting their agendas, i.e., they have businesses that will sell the machinery, that will sell the services, relative to the positions, the political and social positions that they're promoting.
[01:48:36.212 --> 01:48:45.036]  So, you have to be very leery at listening to their so-called experts, who I'm going to coin a new phrase today that will go down in history next to the word normalcy.
[01:48:45.856 --> 01:48:53.579]  When somebody is an expert of dubious intention, he shall now be referred to as a Foxpert.
[01:48:53.579 --> 01:48:55.280]  A Foxpert instead of an expert?
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:55.900]  That's correct.
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:59.602]  Well, these are all the think tank guys, the Council on Foreign Relations guys.
[01:48:59.602 --> 01:49:07.505]  I mean, of course, they're out there to shill and to be, I guess what you would call in many ways, a controlled opposition if you're a conservative.
[01:49:08.495 --> 01:49:10.656]  So, I think most people know not to trust them.
[01:49:10.656 --> 01:49:17.877]  In fact, I think the numbers are down so much at Fox News that they've got to be wondering, maybe they should be covering 9-11 truth.
[01:49:17.877 --> 01:49:20.758]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:49:20.758 --> 01:49:24.219]  I don't know if they're covering that, but I'm not blaming them alone.
[01:49:24.219 --> 01:49:27.980]  I'm just saying they're the worst example of a large number of bad examples.
[01:49:28.716 --> 01:49:31.817]  The New York Times is another one that also plays the game very well.
[01:49:31.817 --> 01:49:34.277]  Absolutely.
[01:49:34.277 --> 01:49:43.319]  Going back to my last statement, they are covering 9-11 truth news on Bill O'Reilly, and they know that this is how they get big ratings, going after Rosie O'Donnell, doing these things.
[01:49:43.319 --> 01:49:51.880]  And then coming out, one of the first reports after the VTech shooting, here you have one of the Foxperts, as you call them, advocating gun control.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:55.861]  So, I mean, that's got to be shocking to conservatives that have hung their hat on faux news.
[01:49:56.181 --> 01:49:59.303]  By the way, you mentioned O'Reilly and you jogged my memory.
[01:49:59.303 --> 01:50:03.204]  He always has Geraldo Rivera on as a guest, as we all well know.
[01:50:03.204 --> 01:50:13.449]  And Geraldo, since the VT shootings, the Virginia Tech shootings, has been advocating tougher policies with people and mental hygiene issues.
[01:50:13.449 --> 01:50:14.590]  Total neoliberal, yeah.
[01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:16.211]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:50:16.211 --> 01:50:22.934]  Your listeners should know, many of them are probably not old enough, but I am, and some of us have old memories, that this same man,
[01:50:23.533 --> 01:50:30.915]  Was instrumental in the movement in this country in 1971, 1972, alright?
[01:50:30.915 --> 01:50:39.698]  In the deconstruction of the mental hygiene system and in the system in which there were sanitariums in which people were in.
[01:50:39.698 --> 01:50:42.538]  So first this guy said, let them all out.
[01:50:42.538 --> 01:50:46.820]  Now today he goes, he's on, of course, on Fox, he's an employee of Fox.
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.000]  Now he says, lock them all up.
[01:50:48.413 --> 01:50:53.337]  This is a huckster that takes whatever position, like a gear shifter, you understand?
[01:50:53.337 --> 01:50:58.841]  Just to keep himself prominent and satiated, I guess, in the limelight and in a nice salary.
[01:50:58.841 --> 01:51:02.703]  This guy has no legitimacy and nobody should be taking him seriously.
[01:51:02.703 --> 01:51:08.908]  You can't say apples one day and then say oranges the next and have a legitimate point of view.
[01:51:08.908 --> 01:51:14.392]  Yeah, you have no credibility in doing that and let's not forget the staged fight that O'Leilly and
[01:51:15.425 --> 01:51:20.568]  A gentleman you mentioned had in order to take our minds off of more 9-11 information with Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:51:20.568 --> 01:51:21.348]  We'll take a quick break.
[01:51:21.348 --> 01:51:22.849]  We'll come back to take more of your calls.
[01:51:22.849 --> 01:51:23.929]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:23.929 --> 01:51:24.610]  I'm Jack Blood.
[01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:25.210]  Please stay tuned.
[01:51:36.278 --> 01:51:42.108]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:42.108 --> 01:51:49.701]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:57.896]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:57.896 --> 01:52:09.624]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:09.624 --> 01:52:13.607]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:13.607 --> 01:52:15.869]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:15.869 --> 01:52:19.692]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:34.992 --> 01:52:39.833]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:52:39.833 --> 01:52:44.215]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:52:44.215 --> 01:52:45.075]  We listened.
[01:52:45.075 --> 01:52:50.316]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:52:50.316 --> 01:52:51.197]  We listened.
[01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:54.657]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:52:54.657 --> 01:52:55.658]  We listened.
[01:52:55.658 --> 01:52:59.699]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:53:00.179 --> 01:53:00.940]  We listened.
[01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:06.586]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:53:06.586 --> 01:53:08.308]  Again, we listened.
[01:53:08.308 --> 01:53:15.636]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:53:16.096 --> 01:53:18.918]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[01:53:18.918 --> 01:53:19.159]  Only $279.

[01:53:19.819 --> 01:53:20.119]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:53:21.781 --> 01:53:22.721]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:53:32.344 --> 01:53:34.286]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:53:34.286 --> 01:53:38.311]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:41.034]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:53:41.034 --> 01:53:47.401]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:53:47.401 --> 01:53:52.286]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:53:52.346 --> 01:53:52.586]  I think?
[01:54:08.618 --> 01:54:09.078]  I think so.
[01:54:49.787 --> 01:54:53.288]  Going right back to the phones, let's go to Eric in Connecticut.
[01:54:53.288 --> 01:54:54.329]  Eric, thank you for holding.
[01:54:54.329 --> 01:54:56.009]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:56.009 --> 01:54:58.970]  Hey Jack, thanks for taking my call.
[01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:14.316]  In light of the recent events in Virginia, it's interesting how a lot of the television shows today are far more pro-establishment, pro-government than the old shows, say from the 90s,
[01:55:16.078 --> 01:55:20.009]  Early 90s, late 80s, and I'll give you a great example, the X-Files.
[01:55:22.119 --> 01:55:23.059]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:55:23.059 --> 01:55:35.663]  I mean, I always thought the X-Files put, you know, bizarre alien information next to things that were true in order to discredit it, so I'm not saying that that was the plan, but it sure kind of had that effect, didn't it?
[01:55:35.663 --> 01:55:38.483]  Much like other modes of communication.
[01:55:38.483 --> 01:55:48.366]  That's why I love this show and what Alex does is because he sticks to the facts, he reports what's documented, and he doesn't go off on tangents about lizards or whatever it's going to be.
[01:55:48.366 --> 01:55:49.186]  Oh, I understand that.
[01:55:49.206 --> 01:55:54.170]  Yeah, but there were episodes, there were certain episodes that had nothing to do with the aliens or anything like that.
[01:55:54.170 --> 01:55:56.232]  I'll give you a great example.
[01:55:56.232 --> 01:56:03.497]  There was an episode, and I believe it was the second or third season, and the title of it was called Blood.
[01:56:03.497 --> 01:56:11.403]  And it was about an ex-Navy guy who had this phobia about blood.
[01:56:11.403 --> 01:56:15.767]  And there was an experiment, and I believe it was in this small Maryland town.
[01:56:17.162 --> 01:56:19.163]  And Mulder, he was working by himself.
[01:56:19.163 --> 01:56:20.544]  Scully wasn't with him on this one.
[01:56:20.544 --> 01:56:28.927]  He was working by himself and he was examining these murders that took place in this town.
[01:56:28.927 --> 01:56:33.890]  And electronic devices were common to all of these murders.
[01:56:33.890 --> 01:56:41.233]  And he looks into it more and he realizes that these people are seeing these messages in these electronic devices.
[01:56:42.219 --> 01:56:43.901]  And there was some poisoning going on.
[01:56:43.901 --> 01:56:45.764]  Some of the local fields were being sprayed.
[01:56:45.764 --> 01:56:51.592]  Basically, to make a long story short, there was a government-sanctioned experiment on the people of this town.
[01:56:52.432 --> 01:56:56.136]  And they were, um, they were fomenting mind control.
[01:56:56.136 --> 01:56:56.476]  Right.
[01:56:56.476 --> 01:56:59.319]  And this guy ends up this... No, I mean, there was some good stuff there.
[01:56:59.319 --> 01:57:13.772]  I love the episode, by the way, of The X-Files where it's near the end of the series and they find some aliens and they go and they inspect the scene and they pull off the heads and they are CIA agents in alien uniforms posing as aliens.
[01:57:13.772 --> 01:57:14.733]  I thought that was pretty good.
[01:57:15.514 --> 01:57:16.014]  Well, yeah.
[01:57:16.014 --> 01:57:16.615]  But you made a point.
[01:57:16.615 --> 01:57:19.157]  Let me go back to the original point that you made, if I could, Eric.
[01:57:19.157 --> 01:57:21.919]  Because, you know, look at today's TV schedule.
[01:57:21.919 --> 01:57:23.280]  It's programming.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.541]  500 channels of it.
[01:57:24.541 --> 01:57:25.622]  Programming, okay?
[01:57:25.622 --> 01:57:29.165]  They don't call it that for an anomalous reason.
[01:57:29.165 --> 01:57:30.146]  It's cop shows.
[01:57:30.146 --> 01:57:31.167]  It's court shows.
[01:57:31.167 --> 01:57:32.027]  It's CSI.
[01:57:32.027 --> 01:57:34.029]  It's The Running Man, basically.
[01:57:34.029 --> 01:57:35.250]  It's medical shows.
[01:57:35.250 --> 01:57:36.491]  I mean, just littered with that.
[01:57:36.491 --> 01:57:39.333]  And if you're not getting that, it's sports and reality TV.
[01:57:39.333 --> 01:57:40.975]  So you make a good comment that
[01:57:41.135 --> 01:57:42.357]  I'll give you one more example of...
[01:57:51.821 --> 01:57:54.402]  Well, anyway, this X-File episode, he goes up to the tower.
[01:57:54.402 --> 01:57:57.564]  This guy goes up to the tower, akin to... I gotta cut you there, man.
[01:57:57.564 --> 01:57:58.344]  I gotta keep moving.
[01:57:58.344 --> 01:58:02.647]  We can't go over all the X-File episodes, but you made a good point, and let's stick with that.
[01:58:02.647 --> 01:58:06.389]  Gotta go to Torin Wolf, a friend of ours here in Texas.
[01:58:06.389 --> 01:58:10.411]  He's an ex-Iraqi vet who has been opened up to 9-11 truth.
[01:58:10.411 --> 01:58:10.971]  He's out there.
[01:58:10.971 --> 01:58:15.213]  In fact, I know you were out with the guys this Saturday in front of the Statehouse.
[01:58:15.213 --> 01:58:16.734]  Torin, thanks for joining us.
[01:58:16.734 --> 01:58:18.015]  Thanks for talking to me, Jack.
[01:58:18.015 --> 01:58:20.776]  I always appreciate talking to a fellow patriot.
[01:58:21.707 --> 01:58:25.752]  Well, you're a patriot with a lot to lose, and you've got a great background.
[01:58:25.752 --> 01:58:33.280]  You were an Army nurse, you were a combat nurse in Iraq, and you paid the price over there.
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.345]  Earlier on the show, we were talking about depleted uranium, and I guess if we really support the troops,
[01:58:38.065 --> 01:58:45.952]  We need to, you know, embody in bold the current investigations, the cover-ups that are going on right now about depleted uranium.
[01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:48.795]  I'd like to bring you back if you can hold about 70-80 seconds.
[01:58:48.795 --> 01:58:51.998]  We'll come back for the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:51.998 --> 01:58:53.079]  Appreciate everybody joining us.
[01:58:53.079 --> 01:58:53.919]  Phone lines are open.
[01:58:53.919 --> 01:58:55.461]  We've got a lot of news to report.
[01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:56.202]  Stay with us.
[01:58:56.202 --> 01:58:57.923]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:57.923 --> 01:59:00.025]  It's the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:13.348 --> 01:59:18.374]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:59:23.547 --> 01:59:26.750]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:30.913]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:59:30.913 --> 01:59:33.555]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:59:33.555 --> 01:59:36.077]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:59:36.077 --> 01:59:44.585]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:59:44.585 --> 01:59:46.026]  The Brookie light is different.
[01:59:46.026 --> 01:59:50.009]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:59:50.289 --> 01:59:51.650]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:00:21.957 --> 02:00:24.359]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:24.359 --> 02:00:33.646]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:33.646 --> 02:00:34.967]  Big Brother.
[02:00:34.967 --> 02:00:36.729]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:36.729 --> 02:00:38.470]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:40.071]  You want answers?
[02:00:40.071 --> 02:00:40.972]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:40.972 --> 02:00:45.816]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:45.816 --> 02:00:49.879]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:52.779 --> 02:00:54.141]  Thank you for joining us today, folks.
[02:00:54.141 --> 02:00:58.927]  The third hour of the Alex Jones Show coming your way on Genesis Communications Network.
[02:00:58.927 --> 02:01:02.271]  I'm Jack Blood, your radio gun sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[02:01:02.271 --> 02:01:03.573]  One more hour to go.
[02:01:04.764 --> 02:01:06.244]  We'll keep the phone lines open.
[02:01:06.244 --> 02:01:08.485]  No guests.
[02:01:08.485 --> 02:01:08.785]  800-259-9231.
[02:01:08.785 --> 02:01:09.965]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:09.965 --> 02:01:14.687]  Got a lot of news to go over.
[02:01:14.687 --> 02:01:17.988]  We'll do that, but we'll take a few more of your calls in the meantime.
[02:01:17.988 --> 02:01:21.189]  Speaking with Torin Wolfe on the line from Texas here.
[02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:27.410]  Torin, I tried to give you a little bit of an introduction here, but I know you called in for something, so you got the floor, buddy.
[02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:28.451]  Well, thanks a lot, Jack.
[02:01:28.451 --> 02:01:29.271]  I do appreciate it.
[02:01:31.005 --> 02:01:40.929]  Anybody who's been listening to the presentations that I've been doing knows that I have a background, a very significant background, specifically in hazardous materials.
[02:01:40.929 --> 02:01:47.591]  I was a hazardous materials consultant licensed as an asbestos consultant here in the state of Texas for 12 years.
[02:01:47.591 --> 02:01:59.376]  And while I was putting together my final points on a PowerPoint that I'm going to be doing this weekend, I just decided that I wanted to go ahead and get the EPA's actual
[02:02:00.305 --> 02:02:00.705]  We're good to go.
[02:02:29.904 --> 02:02:30.405]  I don't
[02:02:41.940 --> 02:02:43.582]  September 14, 2001.
[02:02:43.582 --> 02:03:03.663]  So they give the alert that you can go back into the city, and that's an important point to make, Torim, because they're not just talking about the rescue workers, they're talking about people that got out of the city, it's now safe to go back, go shopping, but they hadn't actually even begun to do any type of analysis on this, although I'm sure they were aware of what the possibilities were, until the day after they made that announcement.
[02:03:04.224 --> 02:03:10.469]  Well, yeah, that's actually the most interesting thing, is that they had absolutely no proof.
[02:03:10.469 --> 02:03:17.274]  And in a hazardous material situation, until you can prove that the area is safe, it is considered unsafe.
[02:03:17.274 --> 02:03:18.475]  That's federal law.
[02:03:18.475 --> 02:03:23.418]  So you think it's conscience-shocking for them to have told everybody to go back in and it was safe to go in?
[02:03:23.418 --> 02:03:26.821]  I mean, that's what the courts ruled, that it wasn't conscience-shocking.
[02:03:26.821 --> 02:03:28.542]  Well, if you don't have a conscience, no.
[02:03:28.542 --> 02:03:29.783]  Exactly, that was my point.
[02:03:31.614 --> 02:03:37.398]  If you're willing to sell your soul for anything, I guess not.
[02:03:37.398 --> 02:03:38.759]  I about came unglued.
[02:03:38.759 --> 02:03:45.883]  I actually called my wife from upstairs saying, you're not going to believe what I just caught these people in.
[02:03:45.883 --> 02:03:49.065]  I was kind of surprised that nobody had grabbed this.
[02:03:49.065 --> 02:03:52.908]  It's also interesting that the ruling seems to come into conjunction.
[02:03:52.908 --> 02:03:58.751]  We just had a caller call in and they announced that Rosie O'Donnell on Network TV on The View was going to tackle this subject.
[02:04:00.112 --> 02:04:00.812]  I wholeheartedly agree.
[02:04:28.985 --> 02:04:42.676]  I'll tell you, as one of the things that I've always tried to stay focused on is the human element, not just the raw emotion that is just obviously there.
[02:04:42.676 --> 02:04:48.561]  But in addition to the science, which is 2 plus 2 always equals 4, folks.
[02:04:48.561 --> 02:04:49.802]  I'm sorry.
[02:04:49.802 --> 02:04:51.963]  That's science.
[02:04:51.963 --> 02:04:53.845]  But the human element is
[02:04:55.084 --> 02:04:59.025]  Much, much more important to me than somebody's opinion.
[02:04:59.025 --> 02:05:05.548]  And what I did last night is I downloaded all of the names of the World Trade Center victims.
[02:05:05.548 --> 02:05:06.608]  Every single one of them.
[02:05:06.608 --> 02:05:08.649]  I've got a pretty high-speed computer.
[02:05:08.649 --> 02:05:14.851]  And it completely overloaded my buffers on my $3,000 computer system.
[02:05:14.851 --> 02:05:15.671]  Hold on for one second.
[02:05:15.671 --> 02:05:16.752]  I'll give you another minute on the other side.
[02:05:16.752 --> 02:05:18.152]  We've got to go to more calls and more news.
[02:05:18.152 --> 02:05:19.133]  The Alex Jones Show, folks.
[02:05:19.133 --> 02:05:19.513]  Stay tuned.
[02:05:19.513 --> 02:05:20.033]  Infowars.com.
[02:05:32.398 --> 02:05:38.204]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:38.204 --> 02:05:45.811]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:46.539 --> 02:05:54.004]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:54.004 --> 02:06:05.731]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:05.731 --> 02:06:09.694]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:09.694 --> 02:06:11.955]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:11.955 --> 02:06:15.738]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:06:16.388 --> 02:06:29.095]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:29.095 --> 02:06:34.218]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:06:34.218 --> 02:06:41.703]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:06:41.703 --> 02:06:45.605]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria.
[02:06:45.825 --> 02:06:52.514]  Cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:06:52.514 --> 02:06:57.360]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:02.326]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:07:02.526 --> 02:07:05.708]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:07:05.708 --> 02:07:15.595]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:07:15.595 --> 02:07:20.538]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:07:20.538 --> 02:07:22.579]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:07:30.484 --> 02:07:36.346]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:07:36.346 --> 02:07:41.467]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:07:41.467 --> 02:07:44.588]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:07:44.588 --> 02:07:48.770]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:07:48.770 --> 02:07:53.551]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:07:53.551 --> 02:07:57.332]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:07:57.332 --> 02:08:00.173]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:08:00.945 --> 02:08:03.106]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:08:03.106 --> 02:08:04.908]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:08:04.908 --> 02:08:05.108]  U.S.
[02:08:05.108 --> 02:08:07.349]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:08:07.349 --> 02:08:08.069]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.550]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:09.210]  Ask for George.
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:32.841]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:32.841 --> 02:08:45.843]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:45.843 --> 02:08:47.943]  Mary Bell in Texas.
[02:08:47.943 --> 02:08:48.903]  Fred in Philly.
[02:08:48.903 --> 02:08:49.904]  Don in Tennessee.
[02:08:49.904 --> 02:08:50.724]  Rick in Tennessee.
[02:08:50.724 --> 02:08:53.144]  We're going to get to everybody today, this Monday.
[02:08:53.144 --> 02:08:54.304]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:54.304 --> 02:08:56.585]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[02:08:56.585 --> 02:08:57.985]  We have Torn Wolf on the line who
[02:08:58.903 --> 02:08:59.904]  He's an amazing individual.
[02:08:59.904 --> 02:09:10.013]  We met him over here for the Rebuilding America's Census Conference by the Project for New American Citizen and we're lucky to have him here in Austin, Texas.
[02:09:10.013 --> 02:09:16.199]  A combat veteran, fought the hard fight in Iraq and he's one of the troops that we certainly support.
[02:09:16.199 --> 02:09:18.160]  He's done some great research.
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:23.165]  Torn, I just wanted to give you a minute to finish up and if you want to, if you're giving a presentation somewhere, you're more than welcome to plug it.
[02:09:23.809 --> 02:09:26.032]  Well, I do appreciate that very much.
[02:09:26.032 --> 02:09:33.701]  The presentation is actually kind of for private groups, but I'm going to be doing it here public in the next couple of weeks.
[02:09:33.701 --> 02:09:39.488]  One thing that I wanted to throw out as a point of honor is that Michelle with Austin911truthnow.org
[02:09:43.386 --> 02:09:44.807]  She actually gave me a new nickname.
[02:09:44.807 --> 02:09:47.567]  She said that I am the first sergeant of 9-11 Truth.
[02:09:47.567 --> 02:09:51.888]  I'm not going to argue with that.
[02:09:51.888 --> 02:09:57.370]  And seeing how big you are, I'm not going to argue with just about anything you say, George.
[02:09:57.370 --> 02:09:58.930]  I'm glad you're on my side, brother.
[02:09:58.930 --> 02:09:59.950]  I'll tell you that right now.
[02:09:59.950 --> 02:10:02.431]  I'm definitely on your side, as long as you're on the side of the truth.
[02:10:03.531 --> 02:10:07.235]  There's absolutely nothing that you and I are going to cross swords with.
[02:10:07.235 --> 02:10:10.938]  That's the other thing that I wanted to say real quick is that you said that I had a lot to lose.
[02:10:10.938 --> 02:10:14.041]  Well, the fact is that they can't take anything from me.
[02:10:14.821 --> 02:10:16.141]  Because I've got the truth.
[02:10:16.141 --> 02:10:16.982]  Period.
[02:10:16.982 --> 02:10:17.862]  Stone cold.
[02:10:17.862 --> 02:10:18.342]  Atta boy.
[02:10:18.342 --> 02:10:21.343]  If you want to take my freedom, you can take my freedom.
[02:10:21.343 --> 02:10:24.003]  And you can lock me up, but the truth is still there.
[02:10:24.003 --> 02:10:32.186]  That's right, and because millions of people now have that same attitude, these rats are scurrying to run to jump off the ship and figure out a way around all this.
[02:10:32.186 --> 02:10:34.846]  Well, you keep up the good fight, brother, and we got your back.
[02:10:34.846 --> 02:10:35.507]  I know you got ours.
[02:10:35.507 --> 02:10:36.927]  Thanks for the call today.
[02:10:36.927 --> 02:10:38.287]  Mary Bell in Texas.
[02:10:38.287 --> 02:10:39.608]  Mary Bell, thank you for joining us.
[02:10:39.608 --> 02:10:40.588]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:41.128 --> 02:10:42.669]  Hi, this is my first time calling.
[02:10:42.669 --> 02:10:43.630]  Thanks for taking it.
[02:10:43.630 --> 02:10:44.411]  I have a question.
[02:10:44.411 --> 02:10:48.174]  I'm a homeschool parent, and I wanted to know if you could comment on this.
[02:10:48.174 --> 02:11:03.405]  Do you remember after 9-11, a long time after that, Michelle Milkman had written an article on how a school, I do not remember the citation, but it's on her site somewhere, where a school was practicing drills, teaching little children, let's protect ourselves.
[02:11:03.405 --> 02:11:04.026]  Do you remember that?
[02:11:04.867 --> 02:11:09.516]  Yeah, and they said, uh, and they used homeschoolers as the potential terrorists.
[02:11:09.516 --> 02:11:10.497]  Of course, yes.
[02:11:10.497 --> 02:11:13.483]  Michelle Malkin, uh, well, I probably couldn't say on a...
[02:11:14.571 --> 02:11:22.275]  On a radio show such as this, what I really think of her, but she's done some hit pieces on me, and she is certainly working for the establishment order.
[02:11:22.275 --> 02:11:27.818]  In fact, she wrote a book, as you know, about putting people in camps and internment camps here in the United States.
[02:11:27.818 --> 02:11:30.160]  So she is really a vampire, isn't she?
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:32.881]  Yeah, homeschoolers are the problem, isn't that right?
[02:11:32.881 --> 02:11:43.267]  I know a lot of people who homeschool like yourself, and you can comment on this, and they are the best, the truest, the most honest people, the most educated kids, the best behaved kids you'll find anywhere, bar none.
[02:11:43.885 --> 02:11:45.106]  So Jack, do you have a comment?
[02:11:45.106 --> 02:11:48.430]  Do you think, is there a reason why we're being targeted?
[02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:50.673]  Is this going to be seen more?
[02:11:50.673 --> 02:11:55.158]  I saw a Law and Order episode about two years ago where it was the exact same thing.
[02:11:55.158 --> 02:11:59.743]  There were terrorists, there were homeschoolers, because they want
[02:12:00.103 --> 02:12:01.364]  To be your parents.
[02:12:01.364 --> 02:12:02.824]  They want the government to be your parents.
[02:12:02.824 --> 02:12:13.548]  They want to put you in these government indoctrination centers which are ruled by the United Nations and UNESCO and the Carnegie Endowment or the Carnegie Institute, the Carnegie Foundation.
[02:12:13.548 --> 02:12:15.469]  They help print the books, okay?
[02:12:15.469 --> 02:12:17.350]  And they want people in that system.
[02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:25.013]  And that is, by the way, comes right out of Russia and I really highly advise anybody who's interested in education to read Charlotte Isserby's great book
[02:12:25.353 --> 02:12:27.134]  The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.
[02:12:27.134 --> 02:12:30.975]  She also has free downloads at DeliberateDumbingDown.com.
[02:12:30.975 --> 02:12:32.436]  She has the documents.
[02:12:32.436 --> 02:12:41.500]  She was, I believe, the Deputy Secretary of Education under Ronald Reagan and she will flesh that out for you and you'll find out exactly why they're doing it.
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:42.220]  But good for you
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:43.601]  Okay, yeah, I like her.
[02:12:43.601 --> 02:12:44.162]  I have her book.
[02:12:44.162 --> 02:12:47.445]  I know her, and I just want other homeschoolers to tune into this radio.
[02:12:47.445 --> 02:13:04.182]  So if you do cover any issues revolving around that, I'm sure they would be really... Well, you know, the funny thing is, is I've tried to cover this issue again and again and again, and I usually contact the big homeschooling organizations out there who are organized to put out newsletters and give information to people like yourself, people like myself.
[02:13:04.182 --> 02:13:05.584]  I'm homeschooling my child as well.
[02:13:06.785 --> 02:13:10.888]  And I've found that they are scared to death of people like me.
[02:13:10.888 --> 02:13:27.120]  They either don't want to come on the show, they don't want to answer questions, so I think we also have to be aware of the controlled opposition within the homeschooling apparatus, and we've just got to go out on our own and do it on our own and do it without any help from the government, but we'll try to do as much on that as we can.
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:28.941]  Mary Bell, I'm glad you called in for the first time.
[02:13:28.941 --> 02:13:29.762]  I hope you call back, okay?
[02:13:29.762 --> 02:13:30.602]  Thank you.
[02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:31.163]  Keep the faith.
[02:13:31.583 --> 02:13:33.084]  Let's go to Fred in Philly.
[02:13:33.084 --> 02:13:34.204]  Fred, thank you for calling in.
[02:13:34.204 --> 02:13:35.085]  Always good to hear from you.
[02:13:35.085 --> 02:13:36.685]  Fred, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:36.685 --> 02:13:37.526]  Hi.
[02:13:37.526 --> 02:13:52.972]  I want to talk about, did you know that the Homeland Security Department wants to take over the domain name system and be able to trace any internet site that's established?
[02:13:52.972 --> 02:13:54.292]  Well, they can do that already, of course.
[02:13:54.292 --> 02:13:55.293]  They want to do it legally.
[02:13:55.293 --> 02:13:56.753]  That's what you're talking about.
[02:13:56.753 --> 02:13:58.654]  Well, no.
[02:13:58.654 --> 02:14:00.435]  Right now, there's a certain method that
[02:14:01.316 --> 02:14:05.645]  Uh, allows, uh, an enmity in starting an internet site.
[02:14:07.153 --> 02:14:18.100]  In theory, it allows anonymity, but this is like coming out a year ago and maybe Democrats or Daily Kos or something saying that the government's monitoring us and wiretapping us.
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:19.581]  They've been doing this for years.
[02:14:19.581 --> 02:14:33.130]  They're trying to find a way to legally do it, to put it out front so everybody knows it's going on, and more importantly, to condition and scare people to be afraid to go on the internet and do research and to talk to other people.
[02:14:33.130 --> 02:14:34.891]  So that's what I think you're talking about.
[02:14:34.891 --> 02:14:36.012]  I did read the story, by the way.
[02:14:36.052 --> 02:14:37.253]  Okay.
[02:14:37.253 --> 02:14:39.415]  The other thing, it's an important story.
[02:14:39.415 --> 02:14:45.299]  I think it still needs to be defined exactly what they want.
[02:14:45.299 --> 02:14:53.326]  The other thing is the National Intelligence Director wants a big boost and a change in FISA.
[02:14:53.326 --> 02:15:02.153]  It's going to involve warrants that stem from that, and it's also going to involve more.
[02:15:02.153 --> 02:15:05.676]  I didn't realize this, Jack, but
[02:15:06.181 --> 02:15:09.043]  FISA is available to the general government.
[02:15:09.043 --> 02:15:16.287]  It's not just, let's say, only the CIA can use FISA.
[02:15:16.287 --> 02:15:18.569]  No, that's true.
[02:15:18.569 --> 02:15:27.554]  And the problem is being is that they skirted FISA, even if that, this is I believe an organization that was set up by Jimmy Carter and the Trilateral Commission, but whatever.
[02:15:27.554 --> 02:15:28.395]  The problem is that
[02:15:29.073 --> 02:15:30.274]  I mean, that's bad in itself.
[02:15:30.274 --> 02:15:31.556]  That's a problem in itself.
[02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:43.487]  FISA can authorize immediate warrants without probable cause or without any testimony or evidence to prove that that warrant should be served for a specific location, specific items, okay?
[02:15:43.487 --> 02:15:49.493]  But the problem is that they've openly skirted FISA, bypassed FISA because it's like, again,
[02:15:50.434 --> 02:15:57.136]  An episode of 24, the clock's ticking, and the terrorists are gonna blow something up in two seconds, and we've got to, you know, do this.
[02:15:57.136 --> 02:16:07.579]  So we found out, and this just came out a couple of months ago, that, I think I believe something like 20,000 Americans were investigated for terrorism, and they didn't have, other than Moussaoui, they didn't have one conviction.
[02:16:08.729 --> 02:16:10.490]  And what was the source of that story?
[02:16:10.490 --> 02:16:11.790]  Do you remember?
[02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:14.131]  You can find it on mainstream media.
[02:16:14.131 --> 02:16:16.071]  I might even have it posted on one of my websites.
[02:16:16.071 --> 02:16:18.392]  It came out about two months ago.
[02:16:18.392 --> 02:16:19.072]  Big story.
[02:16:19.072 --> 02:16:25.834]  And this was basically under the auspice of FBI admits illegal wiretapping.
[02:16:25.834 --> 02:16:32.296]  Or FBI admits illegal warrants for war on terrorism.
[02:16:32.296 --> 02:16:33.197]  Look at that.
[02:16:33.197 --> 02:16:36.258]  So like the FBI is almost acting like another NSA.
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:41.001]  It has that generalized power, it can then use computers on calls.
[02:16:41.001 --> 02:17:03.668]  Well, but it's bigger than that too, Fred, because you have to remember now, everything's been centralized and consolidated, so this is what the intelligence czar has put in place to do, to be that capstone in the pyramid that oversees all of these intelligence agencies, whether they're domestic, or whether they're international, and that way they can shut down anyone like John O'Neill, or anyone like Colleen Rowley, anyone that might, you know,
[02:17:04.168 --> 02:17:04.729]  We're good to go.
[02:17:21.864 --> 02:17:49.809]  Massive umbrella to oversee all military actions again, so you don't have any dissenting opinions You don't have anybody any rogue agents that are actually trying to protect the American people and if they continue centralizing in this fashion We're not going to have anyone out there able to tell us what actually is going on in the intelligence world Well, I I use the word I came up with the word super centralized and by that I mean that it's centralization without the
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:18:00.228]  Without the followers or the people that compose a group knowing or giving consent to that.
[02:18:00.228 --> 02:18:06.233]  In other words, it used to be you could have centralization, but it was by consent.
[02:18:06.233 --> 02:18:11.037]  Now you have a secret process called super-centralization.
[02:18:11.037 --> 02:18:15.441]  There is no constitutional authority to put together these super-bureaucracies.
[02:18:15.441 --> 02:18:16.582]  That's right.
[02:18:16.582 --> 02:18:18.824]  And I don't know, maybe someday someone will challenge them on this.
[02:18:19.562 --> 02:18:23.205]  Yeah, well, I think maybe... Not while they're getting paid, they're not.
[02:18:23.205 --> 02:18:29.029]  Maybe if we got rid of the money that was flowing into them, I think that could be their Achilles heel.
[02:18:29.029 --> 02:18:45.482]  Well, and there you hit the nail on the head, because the thing is, if you want to keep getting money at the NSA, or keep getting money at the FBI, or the CIA, or for the intelligence czar, or whatever, you've got to continue to justify your department, to justify your work, and the only way to do that is to find
[02:18:45.862 --> 02:18:53.328]  You know, Fred in Philly as a terrorist, and that way they can receive adequate funding or similar funding or even more funding the next year.
[02:18:53.328 --> 02:18:54.969]  The same thing happens with advertisers.
[02:18:54.969 --> 02:19:04.436]  Every year, advertisers start calling people like me wanting to spend money as fast as possible because if they don't spend the budget from this year, they won't get the same budget for next year.
[02:19:04.436 --> 02:19:05.557]  And it does come down to this.
[02:19:06.397 --> 02:19:12.380]  This kind of segues into the Don Imus story because you've got people out there like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:17.783]  They've got to get out and make something out of nothing or they can't keep getting the donations.
[02:19:17.783 --> 02:19:32.150]  So this works on a vast landscape throughout every NGO and every departmental of bureaucracy and they're all out there trying to justify their jobs and that's why they're so easily used in a compartmentalized fashion to do the things they do.
[02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:34.050]  Okay, well I do have one question for you.
[02:19:35.410 --> 02:19:37.071]  This is slightly different.
[02:19:37.071 --> 02:19:43.375]  It has to do with the Virginia Tech story.
[02:19:43.375 --> 02:19:46.617]  What is a student visa that's called F-1?
[02:19:46.617 --> 02:19:49.059]  Is that permanent or is it temporary?
[02:19:49.059 --> 02:19:49.940]  Have you heard of it?
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:50.980]  I don't know.
[02:19:50.980 --> 02:20:00.367]  Because there was a story that was taken off of Chicago Sun-Times about the
[02:20:02.136 --> 02:20:07.098]  About the shooter and it gave a completely different nationality.
[02:20:07.098 --> 02:20:07.819]  Right, yep.
[02:20:07.819 --> 02:20:09.419]  And we're following up on that as well.
[02:20:09.419 --> 02:20:14.602]  The initial stories by Keith Olbermann and others conflicting to how the story ended up.
[02:20:14.602 --> 02:20:16.142]  But we are investigating that.
[02:20:16.142 --> 02:20:18.603]  Anybody out there have any reports on the truck out?
[02:20:18.603 --> 02:20:19.904]  I'd love to hear it if you do.
[02:20:19.904 --> 02:20:20.664]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:20:20.664 --> 02:20:23.145]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.145 --> 02:20:24.346]  We'll come right back after this.
[02:20:24.346 --> 02:20:25.326]  InfoWars.com.
[02:20:25.326 --> 02:20:26.407]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:20:29.497 --> 02:20:32.820]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:20:32.820 --> 02:20:38.025]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:20:38.025 --> 02:20:42.669]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:20:42.669 --> 02:20:51.797]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:20:51.797 --> 02:20:55.400]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:21:01.023]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:21:01.023 --> 02:21:08.227]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:21:08.227 --> 02:21:08.607]  What about you?
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:14.942]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:21:18.023 --> 02:21:20.584]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:21:36.391 --> 02:21:41.415]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:21:41.415 --> 02:21:44.197]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:21:44.197 --> 02:21:46.659]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:21:46.659 --> 02:21:52.184]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:21:52.184 --> 02:22:00.450]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:22:00.450 --> 02:22:03.513]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:22:05.643 --> 02:22:10.067]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:22:10.067 --> 02:22:11.588]  Call for your copy today.
[02:22:11.588 --> 02:22:14.871]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:14.871 --> 02:22:21.417]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:22:21.417 --> 02:22:21.737]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:21.737 --> 02:22:22.038]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:29.500 --> 02:22:36.087]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:22:36.087 --> 02:22:39.470]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire.
[02:22:41.229 --> 02:22:41.729]  We're good to go.
[02:23:08.148 --> 02:23:08.548]  I think so.
[02:23:31.181 --> 02:23:35.542]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:23:35.542 --> 02:23:37.563]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:23:37.563 --> 02:23:44.144]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:23:44.144 --> 02:23:50.506]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:23:50.506 --> 02:23:52.346]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:23:52.406 --> 02:23:52.986]  We're good to go.
[02:24:15.117 --> 02:24:16.299]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:24:16.299 --> 02:24:19.003]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[02:24:19.003 --> 02:24:19.223]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:24:19.223 --> 02:24:19.283]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:25:03.402 --> 02:25:04.625]  Thank you for tuning in today, folks.
[02:25:04.625 --> 02:25:11.039]  This is the Alex Jones Show, the biggest alternative radio show in the history of the world.
[02:25:12.797 --> 02:25:16.198]  I am very, very honored to be in front of the microphone for Alex today.
[02:25:16.198 --> 02:25:19.679]  Alex will be back tomorrow with his original news and analysis.
[02:25:19.679 --> 02:25:20.999]  You can't get anywhere else.
[02:25:20.999 --> 02:25:30.301]  Please get out and tell people about this network, the Genesis Network, the Alex Jones Show, and the great videos that Alex puts out that raises the standard.
[02:25:30.301 --> 02:25:33.182]  And the reason why you're seeing better and better videos and
[02:25:33.662 --> 02:25:42.311]  And better explanations and documentaries about the trouble that we have here in this country and around the world is because Alex paved the way.
[02:25:42.311 --> 02:25:48.038]  And I truly believe that one of his videos and his work really helped me to wake up.
[02:25:48.038 --> 02:25:52.442]  So I'm just, you know, spreading the word the best I can in honor of Alex Jones.
[02:25:52.442 --> 02:25:53.824]  And I hope you do the same thing.
[02:25:54.664 --> 02:25:57.927]  All the videos are available at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:57.927 --> 02:25:59.848]  Folks, go out and get TerrorStorm.
[02:25:59.848 --> 02:26:01.590]  Contribute to the cause.
[02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:04.352]  I know Alex, like myself, we don't ask for donations.
[02:26:04.352 --> 02:26:07.374]  We don't want you to have to pay the way for us.
[02:26:07.374 --> 02:26:18.443]  We give you a product in return for your investment, and that investment is immediately put back into the operation to continue to spread the truth, to keep the truth alive, and to set the truth free
[02:26:19.594 --> 02:26:23.677]  I highly respect the work of Alex, and I hope everybody gets a Terror Storm.
[02:26:23.677 --> 02:26:25.238]  Get several copies of Terror Storm.
[02:26:25.238 --> 02:26:26.638]  Give them away as gifts.
[02:26:26.638 --> 02:26:35.224]  This is the really predominant work that proves the history of false flag terrorism, which sets up 9-11 almost perfectly.
[02:26:35.224 --> 02:26:37.205]  So, please go out and get those films.
[02:26:37.205 --> 02:26:44.009]  Right now, there's a great deal on America from Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo and Terror Storm.
[02:26:44.009 --> 02:26:45.130]  You can get the two-pack.
[02:26:45.490 --> 02:26:51.417]  For a discount, you get Terror Storm for only $10 if you buy From Freedom to Fascism.
[02:26:51.417 --> 02:26:54.180]  Go to Infowars.com, get those films.
[02:26:54.180 --> 02:26:56.042]  And if not, you can give them a call.
[02:26:56.042 --> 02:26:57.103]  Operators are standing by.
[02:26:57.103 --> 02:26:57.143]  888-253-3139.
[02:27:00.587 --> 02:27:03.469]  888-253-3139.
[02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:06.290]  Get those videos today.
[02:27:06.290 --> 02:27:09.212]  And check out all the t-shirts and the bumper stickers and the hats.
[02:27:09.212 --> 02:27:11.673]  That really opens up conversations.
[02:27:11.673 --> 02:27:24.800]  And even if you're kind of the shy type and you don't, you know, feel like you're comfortable with just going out and yelling at people or going out and being, you know, bold, just get the t-shirt and wear the t-shirt and that will open up conversations.
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:28.802]  And you will be really surprised at how many people you never expected
[02:27:29.202 --> 02:27:39.527]  To believe what you believe, or to be open-minded enough to listen to that information that will come up to you, comment on your t-shirt, and you might have a friend you didn't know you had.
[02:27:39.527 --> 02:27:40.768]  This has certainly happened to us.
[02:27:40.768 --> 02:27:42.569]  I've got many examples of that.
[02:27:42.569 --> 02:27:46.771]  I also know Alex sells those Kato radios, and I can't tell you how much I love those folks.
[02:27:47.111 --> 02:27:48.052]  They are absolutely amazing.
[02:27:48.052 --> 02:27:48.933]  You can get shortwave.
[02:27:48.933 --> 02:27:50.935]  You can get micro FM stations on it.
[02:27:50.935 --> 02:27:53.018]  You can get things that you just can't get anywhere else.
[02:27:53.018 --> 02:27:54.379]  They're very inexpensive.
[02:27:54.379 --> 02:27:55.400]  They're durable.
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:57.222]  It's the best radio I've seen like this.
[02:27:57.222 --> 02:27:58.043]  The Kato radios.
[02:27:58.043 --> 02:28:02.889]  You can get those also by going to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:28:02.889 --> 02:28:03.630]  Call them now.
[02:28:03.630 --> 02:28:04.911]  Operators are standing by.
[02:28:07.654 --> 02:28:09.574]  Speaking of phone numbers, we have one for you.
[02:28:09.574 --> 02:28:10.315]  It is 800-259-9231.
[02:28:10.315 --> 02:28:10.595]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:28:10.595 --> 02:28:13.155]  Phone lines are open.
[02:28:13.155 --> 02:28:19.257]  We've got a lot of news to cover, but let's hear from you today.
[02:28:19.257 --> 02:28:21.037]  Monday is a good day to do that.
[02:28:21.037 --> 02:28:22.918]  Again, Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:28:22.918 --> 02:28:25.338]  Going back to the phones, we've got Don in Tennessee.
[02:28:25.338 --> 02:28:26.599]  Don, thank you for calling in.
[02:28:26.599 --> 02:28:27.939]  You're on the air.
[02:28:27.939 --> 02:28:28.699]  Hello, Jack.
[02:28:28.699 --> 02:28:29.079]  Thanks.
[02:28:29.079 --> 02:28:31.860]  You're doing an excellent job.
[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:35.981]  My wife, first off, I'd initially like to thank WBCR Maribel for
[02:28:37.202 --> 02:28:40.384]  Thank you for introducing me to Alex Jones.
[02:28:40.384 --> 02:28:44.307]  I want to thank WBCR, who has carried my show for years, allegedly.
[02:28:44.307 --> 02:28:49.151]  At least that's what I heard, but they're great people down there, and thank you for giving them that shout out.
[02:28:49.151 --> 02:29:05.543]  Well, I listen over the internet now because I'm out of their range, but my wife works at the real UT, the one in Knoxville, University of Tennessee, and she picked up a book that had been marked down about three or four times, and it marked down to a dollar.
[02:29:06.511 --> 02:29:13.738]  And the title of it is, Go Directly to Jail, subtitled, The Criminalization of Almost Everything.
[02:29:26.069 --> 02:29:33.011]  For my program and he asked the question from the audience and no one could answer this and basically the question was what does government ever do for you?
[02:29:33.011 --> 02:29:34.592]  Have they ever done anything good for you?
[02:29:34.592 --> 02:29:41.594]  And then the second question is and he went on to pontificate about you know how we all break the law every day whether we know it or not.
[02:29:41.594 --> 02:29:49.536]  There's so many laws now and that's why repeal and decentralize is the main crux of what we want to try to do here and what Ron Paul is all about.
[02:29:49.536 --> 02:29:50.957]  Repeal and decentralize
[02:29:51.657 --> 02:29:59.143]  And I just interrupted the heck out of you, and I'd like to bring you back to comment on this, but we're all lawbreakers because there's so many freaking laws.
[02:29:59.143 --> 02:30:01.766]  We can't not be lawbreakers here in Texas.
[02:30:01.766 --> 02:30:04.448]  They're trying to make you wear a helmet to ride your bicycle.
[02:30:04.448 --> 02:30:05.709]  They gotta protect their investment.
[02:30:05.709 --> 02:30:06.750]  We'll come right back after this.
[02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:07.310]  Stay with us, Don.
[02:30:19.634 --> 02:30:23.565]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:23.565 --> 02:30:26.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:30.140 --> 02:30:33.222]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[02:30:33.222 --> 02:30:36.504]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[02:30:36.504 --> 02:30:38.885]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[02:30:38.885 --> 02:30:43.528]  Now, there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[02:30:43.528 --> 02:30:49.832]  SFR Green's Protecta reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.
[02:30:49.832 --> 02:30:51.133]  So do something green.
[02:30:51.133 --> 02:30:55.516]  For a special offer with free shipping, go to GreenGasAdditive.com.
[02:30:55.516 --> 02:30:58.638]  Or to locate a retailer, go to GreenGasAdditive.com.
[02:31:00.623 --> 02:31:03.585]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:31:03.585 --> 02:31:06.206]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:31:06.206 --> 02:31:10.029]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:31:10.029 --> 02:31:17.273]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:31:17.273 --> 02:31:19.854]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:31:19.854 --> 02:31:20.115]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:31:20.115 --> 02:31:20.575]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:31:29.887 --> 02:31:30.768]  Attention gardeners!
[02:31:30.768 --> 02:31:33.372]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:31:33.372 --> 02:31:37.917]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[02:31:37.917 --> 02:31:45.787]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:31:46.107 --> 02:31:49.209]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:31:49.209 --> 02:31:56.834]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:31:56.834 --> 02:32:02.677]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:32:02.677 --> 02:32:08.521]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:32:08.521 --> 02:32:11.763]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:32:12.063 --> 02:32:15.648]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:32:15.648 --> 02:32:20.715]  GCN listeners who want to grow Derv sheep superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:32:20.715 --> 02:32:23.639]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:32:23.639 --> 02:32:23.820]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:30.518 --> 02:32:34.659]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:32:34.659 --> 02:32:41.940]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:32:41.940 --> 02:32:53.442]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network, Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:32:53.442 --> 02:32:54.242]  Central.
[02:32:54.242 --> 02:32:59.843]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:33:00.203 --> 02:33:06.588]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:33:06.588 --> 02:33:11.712]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:33:11.712 --> 02:33:16.956]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:33:16.956 --> 02:33:18.317]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:33:18.317 --> 02:33:19.338]  Central.
[02:33:19.338 --> 02:33:26.743]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetmen.org.
[02:33:53.206 --> 02:33:55.467]  If you want blood, you've got him.
[02:33:55.467 --> 02:33:58.368]  Jack Blood, your radio gun sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[02:33:58.368 --> 02:33:59.609]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[02:33:59.609 --> 02:34:01.249]  In fact, I'll do better than that.
[02:34:01.249 --> 02:34:02.710]  Don, I've got to put you back on hold.
[02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:07.292]  Everybody just hold for a caller, but we have Alex Jones with us right now.
[02:34:07.292 --> 02:34:08.892]  Alex, thank you for calling into the program.
[02:34:08.892 --> 02:34:11.173]  Everyone's looking forward to having you back tomorrow.
[02:34:11.173 --> 02:34:14.735]  I try to do a service, but there are mighty shoes to fill.
[02:34:14.735 --> 02:34:20.457]  I do the best I can to just get through the few hours, and I know everybody's anxious to have you back, but welcome back on the air.
[02:34:20.945 --> 02:34:21.627]  I don't know, Jack.
[02:34:21.627 --> 02:34:22.990]  Thank you for doing the show.
[02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:27.421]  In fact, getting to listen to it at the beach last week and now I'm out in Los Angeles on work.
[02:34:28.672 --> 02:34:29.413]  It's great to have you there.
[02:34:29.413 --> 02:34:30.053]  Thanks a lot.
[02:34:30.053 --> 02:34:34.916]  You taught me everything I know, so I'm trying to display some of it on the show today.
[02:34:34.916 --> 02:34:45.182]  You want to talk about this great truth action here over the weekend at Book People by the great group that has gathered here, and they really confronted Kerry for the first time.
[02:34:45.182 --> 02:34:45.903]  He said that.
[02:34:45.903 --> 02:34:48.064]  You wanted to play that clip and then comment on it?
[02:34:48.064 --> 02:34:48.465]  Sure, sure.
[02:34:48.465 --> 02:34:49.645]  Well, first a comment.
[02:34:49.645 --> 02:34:55.249]  A few weeks ago I saw in the local newspaper that he was going to be there, and I meant to mark that down for us to be there.
[02:34:55.869 --> 02:35:02.933]  I dropped the ball there, but so many of these guys come through Austin now that it's impossible to confront them all.
[02:35:02.933 --> 02:35:07.856]  I dropped the ball on that, but thank God the local 9-11... I was up in Dallas over the weekend, Alex.
[02:35:07.856 --> 02:35:18.563]  I've got to tell you the story, the harrowing story about how the police broke up our meeting up there in Dallas, your former hometown, over the weekend and dogged us for about six or seven hours.
[02:35:18.563 --> 02:35:21.244]  It was harrowing, I think.
[02:35:21.244 --> 02:35:22.525]  What was going on in Dallas?
[02:35:23.537 --> 02:35:31.559]  We had a truth event up there, a political art show, where we mixed rap music with radical politics, and the police didn't take very kindly to that.
[02:35:31.559 --> 02:35:37.380]  Alex brought in the helicopters and multiple police cars, and it was very hard for us.
[02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:38.560]  I'm going to talk about it on my show.
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:39.981]  We don't have enough time to get into it now.
[02:35:39.981 --> 02:35:45.082]  Let's go ahead and play that clip if we can, John, and then we'll have Alex come back and give his analysis as well.
[02:35:45.082 --> 02:35:51.183]  This is, again, the clip of John Kerry being confronted by 9-11 truthers here in Austin just over the weekend.
[02:35:51.183 --> 02:35:51.743]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:35:52.199 --> 02:35:54.280]  I have a question I have for you.
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:36:02.985]  World Trade Center 7 was brought down on September 11th at 5.20 in the evening.
[02:36:02.985 --> 02:36:16.933]  The leaseholder of the World Trade Center complex, Larry Silverstein, gave a public interview on PBS in 2002 and he said that they pulled that building, which is a demolition term for intentionally bringing down a building.
[02:36:17.572 --> 02:36:32.684]  This man made over five billion dollars for those buildings' destruction, and I want to know if there was ever a formal investigation into Larry Silverstein, the leaseholder of the World Trade Center Complex, and his ties to this entire event.
[02:36:32.684 --> 02:36:35.026]  I don't believe there's been a formal investigation.
[02:36:35.026 --> 02:36:35.787]  I haven't heard that.
[02:36:35.787 --> 02:36:36.587]  I don't know that.
[02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:47.096]  I do know that that wall, I remember, was in danger, and I think that they made a decision based on the danger that it had of destroying other things, that they did it in a controlled fashion.
[02:36:48.144 --> 02:36:53.826]  Uh, you know, he's part of the construction, reconstruction effort for the memorial and the use of the land, etc.
[02:36:53.826 --> 02:36:57.087]  There's been a long tug-of-war going on in New York.
[02:36:57.087 --> 02:37:02.248]  I am not following every aspect of it because it's not in my jurisdiction, so to speak.
[02:37:02.248 --> 02:37:04.369]  But I'll check on what the story is.
[02:37:04.369 --> 02:37:06.850]  I'll take a look at it, based on what you've said.
[02:37:06.850 --> 02:37:07.830]  You're the first people.
[02:37:08.248 --> 02:37:11.190]  Anywhere in the country, of course, is my intention.
[02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:18.514]  Well, interestingly enough, the 9-11 Commission report does not even address World Trade Center 7 and the fact that it fell the way that it did.
[02:37:18.514 --> 02:37:19.354]  Let me find out about it.
[02:37:19.354 --> 02:37:20.375]  I don't know enough about it.
[02:37:20.375 --> 02:37:22.776]  It's not in our book, et cetera.
[02:37:22.776 --> 02:37:23.616]  All right, that's basically it.
[02:37:23.616 --> 02:37:25.457]  And then he goes on to try to plug his book.
[02:37:25.457 --> 02:37:29.960]  Alex, first of all, we've got to commend these people for standing up and being bold.
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:32.381]  And a fellow with a leaf blower came by.
[02:37:32.381 --> 02:37:34.802]  When we saw that last night, we uploaded it.
[02:37:34.802 --> 02:37:36.023]  The guys came in to put that.
[02:37:36.890 --> 02:37:39.964]  Aaron and Rob put that up on the web last night.
[02:37:39.964 --> 02:37:41.250]  Is that the clip?
[02:37:41.946 --> 02:37:44.648]  The same clip that's up on PrisonPlanet.com?
[02:37:44.648 --> 02:37:45.028]  Yes.
[02:37:45.028 --> 02:37:46.969]  In fact, I think we played it right from PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:46.969 --> 02:37:56.355]  Actually, there's a prior question by Michelle, also, where she talks about Dr. Stephen Jones and his evidence, and Carrie promises he'll look into what he goes into say.
[02:37:56.355 --> 02:37:58.776]  It's not his jurisdiction, but he'll take a look at it.
[02:37:58.776 --> 02:38:03.519]  He'll do us a big favor here, but that was the prime clip that I think people are talking about.
[02:38:03.519 --> 02:38:08.742]  Yeah, well, I'm not going to take much more of your time, but going from every last night watching a few times,
[02:38:09.452 --> 02:38:13.974]  You could argue that the clip has somewhat of an ambiguous tone to it.
[02:38:13.974 --> 02:38:17.535]  I think that's... I mean, I think it's important to be careful.
[02:38:17.535 --> 02:38:24.378]  But what he's talking about, you know, they collapsed it so it wouldn't damage the wall.
[02:38:24.378 --> 02:38:25.739]  That's the legislary wall.
[02:38:25.739 --> 02:38:28.800]  That's what they call that there.
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:32.441]  And, you know, they're talking about 7 in context there.
[02:38:32.441 --> 02:38:33.362]  So I think that...
[02:38:34.454 --> 02:38:50.066]  You know, most of the evidence, of course we can all lawyer this all day, leans towards him, indeed talking about 7, because the questions were about 7, and then he goes on to say, you know, that, well, it was brought down so that it wouldn't damage the wall.
[02:38:50.066 --> 02:39:02.154]  Now, expanding out from there, the important thing to note is when we first were a listener, back in 2003, early 2003, might have been late 2002, I don't remember now, I think it was 2003,
[02:39:03.866 --> 02:39:11.611]  Email that to the video clip of Larry Silverstein saying that Building 7, you know, they made the decision to pull it and watch the building come down.
[02:39:11.611 --> 02:39:14.213]  And the first few weeks, people said, you know, what does he mean?
[02:39:14.213 --> 02:39:14.993]  Is he talking about 7?
[02:39:14.993 --> 02:39:17.435]  Or, you know, that's out of context.
[02:39:17.435 --> 02:39:19.816]  The point is, they blew up Building 7.
[02:39:19.816 --> 02:39:28.142]  And, I mean, as you know, Jack, but I will definitely, I'm definitely going to watch that clip again.
[02:39:28.795 --> 02:39:30.016]  Well, I get back to my hotel.
[02:39:47.066 --> 02:39:52.108]  I think there's enough there to analyze every word and really try to figure out what it means.
[02:39:52.108 --> 02:40:04.253]  If he is admitting that Building 7 was a controlled demolition and they had to pull it to save something, which I kind of predicted years ago, then that needs to be the biggest story out on the web right now.
[02:40:04.253 --> 02:40:05.473]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:40:05.473 --> 02:40:11.296]  They're kind of sneaking it in now, just kind of halfway out of the side of their mouth going, yeah, yeah, to save their buildings.
[02:40:11.296 --> 02:40:12.236]  Yeah, yeah, we brought it down.
[02:40:12.236 --> 02:40:14.137]  You know, I've been debating people on national radio.
[02:40:15.266 --> 02:40:16.307]  I don't know.
[02:40:35.629 --> 02:40:36.590]  I think that's the next step.
[02:40:55.902 --> 02:40:57.603]  You know, because this happens real time.
[02:40:57.603 --> 02:40:59.124]  I mean, this just happened the other day.
[02:40:59.124 --> 02:41:01.546]  We're trying to, you know, get a diagnostic on this.
[02:41:01.546 --> 02:41:07.870]  And again, you know, what we try to do on this program, and what I try to do on my program and on this network, is to give you, you know, documented facts.
[02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:11.732]  Not go crazy and run with conspiracy theories, certainly.
[02:41:11.732 --> 02:41:13.414]  We want to run with conspiracy facts.
[02:41:13.414 --> 02:41:15.335]  We want to debunk their conspiracies.
[02:41:15.735 --> 02:41:22.537]  So, this is going to take some time, I think, to analyze this, and I think that was a great suggestion that Kerry needs to be called to the carpet.
[02:41:22.537 --> 02:41:25.837]  He needs to give us an official statement of some kind.
[02:41:25.837 --> 02:41:30.878]  His campaign people, or his people, somehow need to get to him.
[02:41:30.878 --> 02:41:32.119]  We need to get to him.
[02:41:32.119 --> 02:41:35.199]  We need to get him to clarify these statements, and who knows?
[02:41:35.199 --> 02:41:37.740]  Maybe we'll get him to say something else.
[02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:38.380]  This, of course,
[02:41:39.312 --> 02:41:47.053]  underscores the real aspect of this, that the citizens have now had enough and they question these people directly.
[02:41:47.053 --> 02:41:51.454]  They're not afraid to put the hard questions to these people face-to-face.
[02:41:51.454 --> 02:42:00.656]  I mean, when you see this video, you'll see these people were literally, you know, 10-15 feet away from Skull & Bones' John Kerry, asking him the most important questions.
[02:42:00.656 --> 02:42:03.536]  And I love when he says, no one's ever asked me that before.
[02:42:03.536 --> 02:42:07.897]  I've been stumping all over the country for years and no one has had the guts
[02:42:08.669 --> 02:42:13.013]  I don't know if I mentioned this before, but this is actually copyrighted by the Cato
[02:42:37.102 --> 02:42:40.563]  You know, it's just so much right in our faces.
[02:42:40.563 --> 02:43:02.771]  Yeah, no, that's exactly it, and this is what they're trying to train our children through, through the indoctrination centers known as public schools, where, look, of course, this, because of the VTEC shootings, I don't know who's getting the contract, Carlisle Group or somebody, to provide, you know, all the security and cameras and lockdowns and automatic computerized, you know, locking doors and all of this infrastructure.
[02:43:03.532 --> 02:43:08.038]  Uh, which of course is going to make our children feel even more like criminals in the Bronx.
[02:43:08.038 --> 02:43:09.580]  We've been reporting this for years.
[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:12.525]  I mean, your children have to go through metal detectors.
[02:43:12.525 --> 02:43:14.688]  There's cameras watching their every move.
[02:43:14.688 --> 02:43:17.952]  There's drug sniffing and bomb sniffing, canine...
[02:43:18.613 --> 02:43:20.695]  Police walking through the halls.
[02:43:20.695 --> 02:43:22.677]  There's armed police walking through the halls.
[02:43:22.677 --> 02:43:37.549]  Now while that might protect them from somebody like Cho, it conditions them to feel like criminals, and then once they graduate, of course, the indoctrination continues, the self-censorship continues, and as I mentioned earlier, I mean, not wearing your seatbelt.
[02:43:37.549 --> 02:43:40.091]  I'm a guy who went to jail, L.A.
[02:43:40.091 --> 02:43:44.055]  County Jail, on a Friday night, and let me tell you folks, that's no picnic.
[02:43:44.665 --> 02:43:46.428]  Because I didn't have my seatbelt on.
[02:43:46.428 --> 02:43:48.932]  I'm a guy who's been arrested for jaywalking.
[02:43:48.932 --> 02:43:52.597]  I'm a guy who's been ticketed and arrested for skateboarding.
[02:43:52.597 --> 02:43:53.319]  Okay?
[02:43:53.319 --> 02:43:59.608]  So, I mean, look, I assume that there's a big war on terror and these guys should have something else to do.
[02:44:00.169 --> 02:44:02.011]  than to make us all into criminals.
[02:44:02.011 --> 02:44:07.676]  So I can only come to the conclusion that they're doing this because they want us to feel like terrorists and criminals.
[02:44:07.676 --> 02:44:10.338]  All of the doctrine points to this.
[02:44:10.338 --> 02:44:15.282]  All of the Patriot Act, especially Section 802 of the Patriot Act, points to this.
[02:44:15.282 --> 02:44:20.907]  They're trying to make us a nation of criminals, and that's the final word on that.
[02:44:20.907 --> 02:44:22.088]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:44:22.088 --> 02:44:23.209]  Now, what do we do?
[02:44:23.209 --> 02:44:26.372]  We have to repeal and decentralize.
[02:44:26.372 --> 02:44:27.393]  That's my mantra.
[02:44:28.353 --> 02:44:30.114]  We have Matt Kazee calling in.
[02:44:30.114 --> 02:44:35.217]  Matt is the gentleman who was giving us on-the-ground reports from the VTEC shooting.
[02:44:35.217 --> 02:44:39.300]  He's just called in, unscheduled, and I hope has some breaking news for us.
[02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:42.481]  Matt, what's new?
[02:44:42.481 --> 02:44:43.102]  Matt Kazee.
[02:44:43.102 --> 02:44:43.942]  Yeah, what's new, Matt?
[02:44:43.942 --> 02:44:45.263]  What do you got?
[02:44:45.263 --> 02:44:52.467]  Well, you know, not to overshadow the news, but the news that you're all covering today is the most amazing news I've heard in quite some time.
[02:44:52.467 --> 02:44:55.349]  It's a quite amazing video there of John Kerry, but I wanted to let you know
[02:44:56.311 --> 02:45:06.101]  That I just posted a video up on Google Video, the process in there right now, of the flag raising and lowering ceremony.
[02:45:06.101 --> 02:45:10.365]  This is the day after, or during the aftermath.
[02:45:10.365 --> 02:45:16.671]  And I was shocked to find out, I thought that I would have to fight through the media to get there just to get a glimpse of it, and nobody was there.
[02:45:16.671 --> 02:45:18.713]  It was the only person that filmed it.
[02:45:18.713 --> 02:45:19.534]  One lone student.
[02:45:21.098 --> 02:45:40.843]  I think it's important to show the healing process of the community, and I've got a small post on the front page of the truthmovement.net explaining the circumstances as I walk down to film the video, and it is on Google Video right now, and I will be posting it on my website here in a few minutes.
[02:45:40.843 --> 02:45:42.743]  I just wanted to let you know that.
[02:45:42.743 --> 02:45:44.183]  So what is the crux of the video?
[02:45:44.183 --> 02:45:45.644]  Give us the fine point.
[02:45:45.644 --> 02:45:50.685]  It is the ROTC ceremony of raising the flag and lowering it to half mast.
[02:45:51.263 --> 02:45:56.828]  Now, the problem I've had with CNN's coverage is pretty obvious to everybody.
[02:45:56.828 --> 02:46:09.801]  You know, they had somebody on there the other night saying that an expert, a psychology expert, saying that the showing of the video over and over again and the pictures over and over again are actually energizing the copycats to come.
[02:46:09.801 --> 02:46:15.286]  And as this guy was telling this, CNN is actually showing the pictures and the video and so
[02:46:15.848 --> 02:46:17.810]  It's kind of disgusting, their coverage.
[02:46:17.810 --> 02:46:24.296]  And so when I went down there to film it, I live very close to the ROTC, I figured that the media would be there to cover it.
[02:46:24.296 --> 02:46:26.958]  And there wasn't no cameras at all.
[02:46:26.958 --> 02:46:28.540]  I was the only guy there with a camera.
[02:46:29.290 --> 02:46:31.132]  And I think that's fairly important.
[02:46:31.132 --> 02:46:49.687]  Matt, do you find it odd that the mourner-in-chief, as I like to call him, and he's right on the ground for 9-11, he's right on the ground for this particular shooting incident at VTEC, but he fails somehow to go, you know, honor the bodies of the troops coming home from Iraq.
[02:46:49.687 --> 02:46:54.752]  I mean, these are all the issues that he's not mourning for, but he mourns for the big photo op, doesn't he?
[02:46:54.752 --> 02:46:56.193]  Never misses that, does he?
[02:46:56.784 --> 02:46:57.866]  Oh, he's a grandstander.
[02:46:57.866 --> 02:46:58.707]  You know what?
[02:46:58.707 --> 02:47:02.874]  It's the only time he's ever had any kind of good ratings whatsoever.
[02:47:02.874 --> 02:47:06.800]  The only time is when there's a tragedy and he can speak like that.
[02:47:07.458 --> 02:47:11.840]  And, uh, yeah, he shows up for that and he showed up to sign autographs and stuff.
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:15.942]  And here's a guy that skipped the funerals for the troops that he sent to Iraq.
[02:47:15.942 --> 02:47:17.903]  He sent to Iraq.
[02:47:17.903 --> 02:47:18.483]  Exactly.
[02:47:18.483 --> 02:47:29.508]  Here's a guy that took his sweet time to get to the Katrina-devastated New Orleans, which was directly his fault and his man's fault, yet he races to Virginia Tech with, uh, you know,
[02:47:30.288 --> 02:47:34.532]  He just hustles down there in a way that is probably not even comparable to 9-11.
[02:47:34.532 --> 02:47:39.717]  I mean, to take advantage of this situation, I think that really is very revealing, Matt.
[02:47:39.717 --> 02:47:40.478]  Absolutely.
[02:47:40.478 --> 02:47:52.809]  And I'll tell you, from being a local on the ground and watching the media circus show up and seeing how they handle themselves around the local restaurants, I know for a fact that Katie Couric got cussed out of the cellar.
[02:47:52.809 --> 02:47:53.150]  Yeah.
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:58.065]  I know for a fact that several others did, too, from the way that they were handling themselves.
[02:47:58.065 --> 02:47:59.947]  Now, here's a strange thing, Jack.
[02:47:59.947 --> 02:48:02.570]  When I watch it on TV, it almost looks believable.
[02:48:02.570 --> 02:48:07.275]  When I was actually there in front of them watching them give their reports, you can tell that they're complete actors.
[02:48:07.275 --> 02:48:07.996]  They don't even care.
[02:48:08.857 --> 02:48:13.058]  Well, I want to go back to how the people are reacting to Bush, but I'll tell you a quick anecdote.
[02:48:13.058 --> 02:48:26.203]  You know, when I was covering the 2004 Democratic National Convention, there was a big speech by Bill Clinton, and people were calling me on my cell phone going, I can't believe how great this guy is, and how wonderful he is, and how the audience just loves him.
[02:48:26.203 --> 02:48:32.385]  Well, they were running around with signs saying, applaud, and they were instructing the audience to be, you know, jubilistic.
[02:48:32.805 --> 02:48:40.630]  To receive this, which was part of the speech in which I think what really got to people around the country was all staged, it was all phony.
[02:48:40.630 --> 02:48:41.630]  Now let's go back to this.
[02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:48.094]  What do the people think about George Bush coming there and trying to exploit the deaths of their friends, their family, the students at VTech?
[02:48:49.119 --> 02:48:56.041]  Well, you know, a lot of people are completely disgusted by CNN's coverage of the whole event.
[02:48:56.041 --> 02:49:00.262]  And I'm sure that there are plenty of people who are upset that Bush was coming.
[02:49:00.262 --> 02:49:02.683]  You know, when it first happened, I was telling people, he's going to be here.
[02:49:02.683 --> 02:49:03.443]  He's going to come.
[02:49:03.443 --> 02:49:04.844]  And everybody was saying, no, he won't.
[02:49:04.844 --> 02:49:05.284]  No, he won't.
[02:49:05.666 --> 02:49:08.888]  I think Blacksburg still hasn't realized how big this thing is.
[02:49:08.888 --> 02:49:11.789]  But concerning what you just said, I have two words.
[02:49:11.789 --> 02:49:13.770]  Political subterfuge.
[02:49:13.770 --> 02:49:20.073]  That's exactly what they do, and they'll take any advantage that they can to turn it into a bigger advantage.
[02:49:20.771 --> 02:49:23.554]  Matt, your reports have gone around the world.
[02:49:23.554 --> 02:49:27.799]  Millions of people have heard the reports you've made on this very show, on this network.
[02:49:27.799 --> 02:49:28.980]  How is it going for you?
[02:49:28.980 --> 02:49:30.782]  Are you getting opposition for this?
[02:49:30.782 --> 02:49:32.904]  Are people upset with you?
[02:49:32.904 --> 02:49:34.887]  Are you getting any kind of threats at all?
[02:49:34.887 --> 02:49:37.089]  How is it going for you covering this?
[02:49:37.089 --> 02:49:40.052]  I have had a couple of strange emails.
[02:49:40.052 --> 02:49:41.234]  I did read a few blogs.
[02:49:41.234 --> 02:49:42.275]  I probably shouldn't be reading them.
[02:49:43.082 --> 02:49:47.226]  One of them said that I would be toast before I made a TV interview.
[02:49:47.226 --> 02:49:55.695]  Another one said that I work for Alex Jones and that, don't you think it's strange that he was there and this was going on?
[02:49:55.695 --> 02:49:58.257]  That sounds like a conspiracy theory, Matt.
[02:49:58.257 --> 02:49:59.218]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:49:59.218 --> 02:50:07.246]  In the very blog that he posted that he was knocking conspiracy theories, this guy doesn't have a clue that the number one crime charged in America is conspiracy.
[02:50:07.646 --> 02:50:10.487]  You say conspiracy in the courtroom, nobody even snickers.
[02:50:10.487 --> 02:50:15.888]  You say it in public, they laugh at you, they ridicule you, and you know, political subterfuge.
[02:50:15.888 --> 02:50:16.769]  Matt Kazee with us.
[02:50:16.769 --> 02:50:18.229]  Matt, I know you won't say it.
[02:50:18.229 --> 02:50:19.189]  I'll say it for you.
[02:50:19.189 --> 02:50:21.090]  You're not going to back down, are you?
[02:50:21.090 --> 02:50:23.411]  No, absolutely not.
[02:50:23.411 --> 02:50:25.591]  Our community is not going to back down.
[02:50:25.591 --> 02:50:31.033]  You know, we are a very strong community, and regardless of what anybody thinks out there, we're a peaceful community.
[02:50:31.033 --> 02:50:32.033]  We always have been.
[02:50:32.803 --> 02:50:39.487]  I'm just ashamed that forever we will be known as the Virginia Tech Master.
[02:50:39.487 --> 02:50:45.550]  Let me ask you this real quick because I'm watching some sporting events and people are kind of exploiting this.
[02:50:45.550 --> 02:50:47.251]  I don't know if they're honoring or exploiting it.
[02:50:47.251 --> 02:50:48.471]  I guess that's the question.
[02:50:48.471 --> 02:50:50.692]  Wearing the VTech hats.
[02:50:50.692 --> 02:50:53.254]  What do the people in your community think about this?
[02:50:53.254 --> 02:50:54.675]  Do they feel honored by that?
[02:50:54.675 --> 02:50:56.776]  Do they feel like they're memorialized by that?
[02:50:56.776 --> 02:50:59.317]  Or do they feel like people are maybe taking advantage of it?
[02:51:00.456 --> 02:51:02.998]  You know, it changes from minute to minute.
[02:51:02.998 --> 02:51:07.201]  I would have to say that Professor Nikki Giovanni summed it up best.
[02:51:07.201 --> 02:51:11.464]  She is one of the professors who pulled us together after the Wilmore of the killings.
[02:51:11.464 --> 02:51:15.546]  And she has done an amazing job pulling us together again.
[02:51:15.546 --> 02:51:18.148]  And we are a proud community.
[02:51:18.148 --> 02:51:21.431]  And so, you know, it's just going to take time to heal, Jack.
[02:51:21.431 --> 02:51:23.052]  Alright, well thanks for your reports, Matt.
[02:51:23.052 --> 02:51:23.752]  You keep the faith.
[02:51:23.752 --> 02:51:24.533]  We got your back, man.
[02:51:24.533 --> 02:51:26.114]  We'll come right back after this final segment.
[02:51:26.114 --> 02:51:27.395]  Big finish on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:27.395 --> 02:51:27.835]  Stay tuned.
[02:51:32.663 --> 02:51:38.492]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:38.492 --> 02:51:46.084]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:46.832 --> 02:51:54.278]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:54.278 --> 02:52:06.006]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:06.006 --> 02:52:09.989]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:09.989 --> 02:52:12.231]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:12.231 --> 02:52:16.014]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:53:29.348 --> 02:53:31.290]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:53:31.290 --> 02:53:35.313]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:53:35.313 --> 02:53:38.035]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:53:38.035 --> 02:53:42.278]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more.
[02:53:42.278 --> 02:53:44.419]  All in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:53:44.419 --> 02:53:49.303]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:53:49.503 --> 02:53:58.852]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:54:44.295 --> 02:54:46.896]  Finish off the program today with your final comments.
[02:54:46.896 --> 02:54:48.377]  Time to put something on the record.
[02:54:48.377 --> 02:54:51.099]  We're going to have to go in rapid fire succession here.
[02:54:51.099 --> 02:54:51.900]  We've got a lot of calls.
[02:54:51.900 --> 02:54:54.141]  I'm going to try to get everybody in, so we'll just let you talk.
[02:54:54.141 --> 02:54:55.022]  I won't even comment.
[02:54:55.022 --> 02:54:56.823]  We'll just go from one call to the next.
[02:54:56.823 --> 02:54:58.584]  Mike in Texas, thanks for calling.
[02:54:58.584 --> 02:55:00.625]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:00.625 --> 02:55:09.831]  Hey, I just want to comment briefly on how the media will deny and everybody will deny that something exists until a couple years later after the apparatus has been attached to our society.
[02:55:10.362 --> 02:55:13.204]  In particular, the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:55:13.204 --> 02:55:14.865]  They said it didn't exist a couple years ago.
[02:55:14.865 --> 02:55:17.267]  Now listen to this teaser during a newscast.
[02:55:17.267 --> 02:55:17.827]  Real briefly.
[02:55:17.827 --> 02:55:23.091]  To put an end to new private toll roads in Texas.
[02:55:23.091 --> 02:55:25.613]  What this means for the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:55:25.613 --> 02:55:26.173]  Tonight at 10.
[02:55:26.173 --> 02:55:28.575]  Okay, that was during a telecast of ER.
[02:55:28.575 --> 02:55:29.856]  Did you get that?
[02:55:29.856 --> 02:55:30.116]  I did.
[02:55:31.893 --> 02:55:37.998]  I saw a billboard the other day that said the Trans-Texas Corridor will help you evacuate in an orderly fashion.
[02:55:37.998 --> 02:55:40.341]  I think that's kind of the crux of the issue, or one of them.
[02:55:40.341 --> 02:55:45.926]  So everybody that gobbles up the mainstream media is gospel.
[02:55:45.926 --> 02:55:47.548]  You're preaching to the choir, brother, man.
[02:55:47.548 --> 02:55:50.530]  I think most people listening to this show know that.
[02:55:50.530 --> 02:55:52.052]  Trent in Texas, quickly.
[02:55:52.052 --> 02:55:53.173]  Trent, put something on the record.
[02:55:53.513 --> 02:56:01.539]  Yeah, I just wanted to make a very quick comment on how the, uh, it seems like the local churches these days have a lot more money, and, uh, they have the big flashy signs.
[02:56:01.539 --> 02:56:07.163]  It almost seems like they're trying to set us up for more of, like, a mental, uh, religious war.
[02:56:07.163 --> 02:56:09.045]  And, uh, on that, I have one more point.
[02:56:09.045 --> 02:56:17.571]  I just wanted to, uh, point out the new Xbox is called the Xbox Elite, and I've noticed their ads are now asking kids if, uh, if they are elitist.
[02:56:18.359 --> 02:56:19.860]  And I thought that was pretty interesting.
[02:56:19.860 --> 02:56:20.680]  Thank you for the call.
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:22.221]  Let's go to Ken in Boston.
[02:56:22.221 --> 02:56:23.321]  Ken, thank you for calling in.
[02:56:23.321 --> 02:56:25.702]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:25.702 --> 02:56:27.083]  Doing a great job, Jack.
[02:56:27.083 --> 02:56:29.524]  It's been a pleasure listening to you for the past couple days.
[02:56:29.524 --> 02:56:33.906]  I just wanted to go over a couple quick things here.
[02:56:33.906 --> 02:56:41.949]  Outrageous that Joe's roommates say they did not recognize him from the film package sent to NBC.
[02:56:41.949 --> 02:56:43.830]  That's April 18th on MSNBC, 10-13 p.m.
[02:56:46.741 --> 02:56:49.584]  Multiple reports of multiple shooters.
[02:56:49.584 --> 02:56:50.685]  What happened to that?
[02:56:50.685 --> 02:56:54.468]  I actually saw a girl say she said three or four shooters.
[02:56:54.468 --> 02:56:59.473]  Ballistics confirming that Cho was the one in less than 24 hours.
[02:56:59.473 --> 02:57:01.975]  How does that happen?
[02:57:01.975 --> 02:57:08.181]  And where and who is that guy that was arrested and shown pretty much everywhere?
[02:57:08.181 --> 02:57:10.323]  I heard... The Chinese National.
[02:57:11.974 --> 02:57:12.494]  What's that?
[02:57:12.494 --> 02:57:13.936]  The Chinese National you refer to?
[02:57:13.936 --> 02:57:14.536]  Yes.
[02:57:14.536 --> 02:57:15.117]  You know what?
[02:57:15.117 --> 02:57:28.589]  I heard myself, while I was watching this, that, and I think it was CNN, I could be mistaken, but I think CNN, reporters said, oh, that's one of our people who got too close.
[02:57:28.589 --> 02:57:29.930]  And, you know, these people,
[02:57:30.419 --> 02:57:31.239]  Isn't it amazing?
[02:57:31.239 --> 02:57:33.240]  I mean, this of course happened in 9-11.
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:45.445]  The initial reports and the evolving reports as they shape the cover story, and we're witnesses to it all, and because we're info warriors, we tape it, and we're able to investigate some of the things that they said.
[02:57:45.445 --> 02:57:50.287]  That's the best part about what we do, and we love guys like you, and I love Boston, man.
[02:57:50.287 --> 02:57:51.888]  That's one of my former hometowns.
[02:57:51.888 --> 02:57:52.748]  Thank you for the call, Ken.
[02:57:52.748 --> 02:57:53.529]  Good call.
[02:57:53.529 --> 02:57:55.209]  James in D.C.
[02:57:55.209 --> 02:57:57.050]  You'll have the final comment on the program today.
[02:57:57.050 --> 02:57:57.911]  You were our tail gunner.
[02:57:57.911 --> 02:57:58.631]  You've got about a minute.
[02:57:58.631 --> 02:57:58.851]  Go ahead.
[02:57:59.961 --> 02:58:02.403]  Yeah, I was calling to comment on this new video game.
[02:58:02.403 --> 02:58:06.847]  I think it's coming out in about a week and a half called 9-11 First Responders.
[02:58:06.847 --> 02:58:07.628]  Have you seen that?
[02:58:07.628 --> 02:58:08.508]  No, I haven't.
[02:58:08.508 --> 02:58:10.170]  Tell us about it quickly.
[02:58:10.170 --> 02:58:13.112]  Man, I just can't believe they're going to allow something like that to come out.
[02:58:13.112 --> 02:58:14.213]  I mean, what is the video game?
[02:58:14.213 --> 02:58:17.296]  Is it going to be something where these guys are fighting for their breath?
[02:58:17.296 --> 02:58:19.698]  Because that's basically what most first responders are doing.
[02:58:20.672 --> 02:58:25.456]  Well, you know, when I was a kid, we used to, you know, play Army in the Woods or whatever.
[02:58:25.456 --> 02:58:33.002]  This is the Technotronic era, as the big new Brzezinski has called it, that will be ruled by a few elites unrestrained by morals.
[02:58:33.002 --> 02:58:34.704]  I think that's the answer to the question.
[02:58:34.704 --> 02:58:35.765]  Thank you for listening, folks.
[02:58:35.765 --> 02:58:37.186]  We're going to come back here in about six minutes.
[02:58:37.186 --> 02:58:39.207]  I'm going to cover the Yeltsin death.
[02:58:39.207 --> 02:58:41.149]  That's the big news story this week.
[02:58:41.149 --> 02:58:43.871]  That association with the JFK assassination.
[02:58:43.871 --> 02:58:45.933]  We also have David Ray Griffin joining us, folks.
[02:58:45.933 --> 02:58:46.874]  Thank you for tuning in.
[02:58:46.874 --> 02:58:48.295]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[02:58:48.295 --> 02:58:49.336]  Remember, folks, get out there!
[02:59:09.397 --> 02:59:13.984]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[02:59:19.730 --> 02:59:25.234]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
