[00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:06.506]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:08.227]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:10.069]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:11.530]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:17.655]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:22.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.046 --> 00:00:33.427]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:35.309]  Welcome.
[00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:53.735]  It is already the 10th day of July 2007 and coming up we've got a engineer and architect coming on to talk about the collapse of the World Trade Center complex buildings, Tower 1, 2, and 7.
[00:00:53.775 --> 00:01:00.640]  Mike Rivera will make his once a month visit to this transmission as well.
[00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:06.805]  Here's an LA Times article, Mexican cartels outgun towns
[00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:08.137]  L.A.
[00:01:08.257 --> 00:01:25.683]  Times today, and I have an entire stack of news here where illegal aliens drunk drive and kill people, but because they never had a license, they're not even charged with felonies, because if you never had a license, then it's only a misdemeanor to drive without one.
[00:01:27.124 --> 00:01:31.565]  And the citizens get the book thrown at them, the illegals get released.
[00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:35.967]  Again, this is all done scientifically.
[00:01:36.678 --> 00:01:44.061]  They get more tuition than citizens, they get bigger tax breaks than citizens, they get blanket tax amnesty if the government has its way.
[00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:49.002]  All done because it's vital to destroy the United States.
[00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:54.244]  And let me tell you, destroying liberty and freedom is their business, the New World Order's business.
[00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:57.606]  Business is extremely brisk.
[00:01:58.406 --> 00:02:01.427]  I mean, it's a bumper crop in tyranny globally right now.
[00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:08.514]  So we'll be going over that report and it dovetails with some really serious news.
[00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:13.257]  Now we're seeing a similar story, similar headline every week now.
[00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:17.419]  Every single week now, we see this headline.
[00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:19.140]  But this is a new one today.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.802]  Euro hits new high against US dollar.
[00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:30.747]  If you type that into Google and you click the news function, you can scroll to the last few months of news with that exact headline.
[00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:38.044]  And you will see it every week, and if you graph it out, the dollar is an absolute free fall.
[00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:40.345]  In fact, it's more than free fall.
[00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:51.187]  In the scheme of economic time, this is the twinkling of an eye, it's equivalent of having your jet airplane pointed straight at the ground and putting your thrusters on full afterburner.
[00:02:53.107 --> 00:02:57.548]  The general public has absolutely no conception of what's happening.
[00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.032]  And maybe I shouldn't be gloom and doom, maybe I should just say this is good!
[00:03:02.052 --> 00:03:15.297]  I mean, mercury's good for your brain, the news says, and getting rid of the Bill of Rights and having more than half the laws that are out there not even being passed by a legislature, just bureaucrats just make it up.
[00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:20.519]  Maybe having an army with 20% illegal aliens in it is good.
[00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:22.480]  Maybe having foreign enforcers is good.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.482]  Maybe everyday seeing videos of cops beating cameramen up with pleasure is good.
[00:03:28.516 --> 00:03:31.837]  Maybe it's good to have almost four trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:38.898]  Maybe it's good that the Chicago Tribune reports the government runs giant child kidnapping rings and no one's going to stop them.
[00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.939]  Maybe all of this is good.
[00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:53.001]  Maybe I should just shut up and be a little more positive about our country that doesn't exist anymore and is being merged into the North American Union and totally blown out financially.
[00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:57.242]  Maybe I should learn to be like a yuppie and just smile about it
[00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:14.749]  Just feel real powerful and official and giggle and snicker and maybe I should go save all my money so I can buy a really big screen TV and show my neighbors and wear some little trinkets like a monkey so I can feel big and powerful.
[00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.692]  Euro hits new high against U.S.
[00:04:18.872 --> 00:04:19.372]  dollar.
[00:04:20.073 --> 00:04:21.975]  Euro soars through 1.37. $1.37.
[00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:30.234]  Now, let me bring that into perspective.
[00:04:30.274 --> 00:04:35.156]  In 2000, the euro was trading at 80 cents for the dollar.
[00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:39.017]  It is now at 137 for the dollar.
[00:04:40.158 --> 00:04:49.921]  That is a 57 cent move.
[00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:54.943]  A 57 cent drop in your dollar.
[00:04:55.844 --> 00:04:56.544]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:10.077]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:18.046]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.757 --> 00:05:25.819]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:37.643]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:41.865]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:43.845]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:48.027]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:17.018 --> 00:06:20.041]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.

[00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:33.450]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.211]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:03.400]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:05.401]  After a pedicure they look great.
[00:07:05.742 --> 00:07:09.584]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[00:07:10.024 --> 00:07:12.205]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:15.987]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:18.829]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.390]  What's that name again?
[00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.951]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:23.511]  It's CalX.
[00:07:23.932 --> 00:07:25.773]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.954]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[00:07:28.743 --> 00:07:37.366]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:07:37.786 --> 00:07:43.509]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:55.013]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:56.792]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[00:07:57.112 --> 00:07:57.793]  I'll be right back.
[00:07:57.913 --> 00:07:59.633]  I'm getting some callots for my heels.
[00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:04.014]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:07.455]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:11.596]  Robert Kennedy, Jr.
[00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:32.351]  Came out at the Live Aid concert yesterday, the ongoing propaganda fest, and said that you're guilty of treason.
[00:08:33.592 --> 00:08:43.098]  If you don't support the fact that global warming is man-made, we've got to have global taxes to the central banks immediately, or we're all dead, basically.
[00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:46.100]  Where am I going to go?
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.341]  Where are my children going to live?
[00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:49.702]  You heard Rothschild last week.
[00:08:49.742 --> 00:08:50.503]  We're all dead.
[00:08:50.583 --> 00:08:50.983]  It's over.
[00:08:51.567 --> 00:09:02.575]  Of course, it's the very eugenic societies that took over modern science who actually do want to corral us into highly controlled cities and then kill us with leisure and pleasure.
[00:09:05.297 --> 00:09:06.558]  This is why they're destined to fail.
[00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:09.280]  Most yuppies, most people aren't going to listen now.
[00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:12.623]  But as things unfold, they will listen.
[00:09:15.265 --> 00:09:17.586]  As the New World Order grows, they will listen.
[00:09:18.087 --> 00:09:20.969]  They will remember and go, where have I heard this before?
[00:09:21.701 --> 00:09:23.842]  Where have I seen this before as it's happening?
[00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:25.982]  Is this deja vu?
[00:09:27.162 --> 00:09:30.163]  And they'll go, no, it was that guy Alex Jones.
[00:09:30.983 --> 00:09:32.683]  He said he had documentation.
[00:09:32.723 --> 00:09:33.804]  He told me where to go.
[00:09:35.444 --> 00:09:38.965]  He made films about it, but I wouldn't go see it.
[00:09:39.485 --> 00:09:41.405]  I was driving down the road in Colorado.
[00:09:41.465 --> 00:09:43.006]  I was driving down the road in Kansas.
[00:09:43.506 --> 00:09:45.806]  I was driving down the road in New York or Texas.
[00:09:46.347 --> 00:09:48.147]  And I heard him and I giggled.
[00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:52.692]  I heard it and I snickered.
[00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:58.636]  Or maybe something more simple that wakes you up.
[00:09:58.696 --> 00:10:05.260]  Like, you heard the politicians in Austin say they would never put toll roads on MoPac when we exposed it three years ago.
[00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:06.801]  And we had their official documents.
[00:10:07.522 --> 00:10:09.323]  And they went on TV and said we were all liars.
[00:10:09.463 --> 00:10:10.964]  It didn't matter if we had their official documents.
[00:10:11.004 --> 00:10:12.805]  They knew you didn't know how to look them up or check them.
[00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:16.388]  Or even if you saw them on our own website, you just denied yourself they were real.
[00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:20.130]  And so you all went to sleep and now they've announced they are putting toll roads on the road.
[00:10:21.449 --> 00:10:27.912]  But you'll still deny it till you're under the foreign-owned controlled toll booths on the existing road.
[00:10:27.952 --> 00:10:30.954]  You'll have to experience it first!
[00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:34.375]  See?
[00:10:34.996 --> 00:10:47.522]  Or, you'll laugh at me about mercury being in vaccines, because, see, when you found out, when people finally figured out that autism was up many thousands of percentage points in the last five, six years,
[00:10:49.326 --> 00:11:01.289]  People started refusing to take it, so the government and the media lied and said, first they said mercury is good for you, that didn't work, so then they said, well we've taken it out, which wasn't true, they actually increased it on average by five times.
[00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:16.594]  If it was at 50 times unsafe levels, they would increase it to 250 times unsafe levels, that's AP by the way, the truth comes out occasionally, and then they would just make lots of available and very small runs of non-thimerosal
[00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:41.950]  So see then, parents who've just had a child a few years ago, the child was fine, but at 18 months gets his third round of shots and the baby's gone forever, and they email me and go, you know what, I don't appreciate you, I've got an autistic child, and you say it's vaccines, they took the mercury out four years ago, and so how does my child have it?
[00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.151]  Well they didn't take the mercury out, Mac.
[00:11:47.751 --> 00:11:49.893]  And by the way, don't blame me for what happened to your child.
[00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:51.514]  I'm trying to save these children.
[00:11:52.795 --> 00:12:01.060]  And then don't email me back and say, yeah, but my child is a boy, and why is it 10 to 1 boys that are autistic?
[00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:02.321]  What is that?
[00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:03.662]  Is Mercury doing that?
[00:12:04.202 --> 00:12:05.163]  Well, yes it is.
[00:12:05.844 --> 00:12:14.970]  There is a, well there's several gene groups that express in males predominantly, that block Mercury in the blood-brain barrier,
[00:12:15.939 --> 00:12:37.875]  That males, many times more often, tend to not have that gene being active, and so it can go across the blood-brain barrier, and it also is affected because they have similar tissues in the intestines to what the blood-brain barrier is, and so the gene is not active there as well, so there's also increased mercury absorption uptake rates.
[00:12:39.677 --> 00:13:02.388]  So you want to get down into actual facts, and this is what frustrates me, because I know when I just say, watch out, the vaccines have got mercury in them, your brains kind of spin like a roulette wheel, or spin like a, you know, the image of a, uh, comes to mind of a slot machine, kind of spins, and then it comes up that, oh wait a minute, they took the mercury out, or then if you know they didn't take that out, well how come it's boys?
[00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:03.469]  You see?
[00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:07.727]  We've researched this.
[00:13:08.247 --> 00:13:22.010]  I've had top scientists, medical doctors, toxicologists, neurologists, brain doctors on this show to talk about it.
[00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.071]  It is conclusive.
[00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:29.052]  Now can you go find some government study paid for by the federal government that says
[00:13:30.154 --> 00:13:31.335]  Well, you can find any study you want.
[00:13:31.355 --> 00:13:32.817]  You can find them saying there's no mercury.
[00:13:33.037 --> 00:13:34.699]  You can find them saying mercury's good for you.
[00:13:34.719 --> 00:13:37.401]  I mean, you can find whatever you want, but it's a load of baloney!
[00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:40.264]  Let me tell you something.
[00:13:41.345 --> 00:13:45.590]  There weren't any autistic children, but maybe one out of a couple million in this country.
[00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.992]  No one even knew what it was 25 years ago.
[00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:49.714]  Now everybody knows.
[00:13:51.523 --> 00:13:59.687]  Now, you can't go to the grocery store, or to the mall, or to church, or to the movies, or anywhere without seeing these poor children.
[00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:03.149]  Many of them being wheeled around in wheelchairs by their mamas.
[00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:06.090]  And it literally brings a tear to my eye.
[00:14:08.532 --> 00:14:13.494]  My children have seen two movies, and I guess once a year, every two years or so, I take them to one.
[00:14:13.514 --> 00:14:14.535]  I went and saw Ratatouille.
[00:14:14.835 --> 00:14:15.415]  It's pretty funny.
[00:14:17.436 --> 00:14:19.737]  And I mean, it was just autistic children.
[00:14:19.757 --> 00:14:21.038]  I probably saw ten of them.
[00:14:22.406 --> 00:14:23.366]  Just everywhere!
[00:14:23.787 --> 00:14:25.427]  I mean, how bad has the plague got to get?
[00:14:26.107 --> 00:14:31.229]  How many brains does a New World Order eugenicist got to grab and just crush in their hands?
[00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:41.033]  And I literally am sitting there, and this one autistic child is, you can tell, getting too much stimuli, yelling, turning around, smiling.
[00:14:41.053 --> 00:14:50.437]  Some of the other autistic children are having episodes in there, and I just looked at them, and you could see their faces when they would turn around and look back at the projector.
[00:14:52.594 --> 00:15:03.882]  You can see in their faces the humanity there locked up because their cerebral cortex, like somebody took a laser beam, has just literally cauterized their cerebral cortex.
[00:15:04.722 --> 00:15:18.071]  The brain's there, the subconscious is there, all the thoughts are there, all the passions are there, all the opportunities are there, but they're walled off forever because that mercury went right through the processing centers and just blew it out.
[00:15:22.293 --> 00:15:28.038]  Like thunderbolts from Zeus right into their brains as the New World Order plays God.
[00:15:30.199 --> 00:15:34.663]  And I don't even know why I just started off the show getting off into autism.
[00:15:35.263 --> 00:15:38.866]  I just... This is the message.
[00:15:39.346 --> 00:15:41.088]  Being ignorant will hurt you.
[00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:46.633]  Not being informed, not being involved will hurt you.
[00:15:46.653 --> 00:15:51.115]  I've been talking a lot this week about the case last week, and there have been more, by the way, since then.
[00:15:51.675 --> 00:16:02.419]  The woman in Kansas, in a major grocery store, in the main aisle, right off the entrance, bleeding to death, stabbed repeatedly in the stomach, in a pool of blood with
[00:16:04.182 --> 00:16:12.408]  Shopper after shopper stepping over her, taking photos on their telephones, like it was television, like it was a spectator sport.
[00:16:12.969 --> 00:16:21.075]  Totally disconnected from reality, totally disconnected from your humanity, totally disconnected from your empathy, totally disconnected from everything.
[00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:26.959]  Totally disconnected.
[00:16:31.405 --> 00:16:32.386]  And we see it more and more.
[00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:44.833]  Now, what do you think the New World Order, who, by the way, engineered this into you by design, I mean, took already our slovenliness, our weakness, our evil, but they've magnified it scientifically, and we have all their own papers on that, where they brag about it.
[00:16:45.153 --> 00:16:49.095]  We're going to make them where they're ineffectual, where they're bestial, where they're petty, where they don't help each other.
[00:16:49.115 --> 00:16:50.316]  We're going to destroy their families.
[00:16:50.616 --> 00:16:52.057]  Then we can mold them however we want.
[00:16:52.257 --> 00:16:56.379]  I mean, I've literally got thousands of documents, hundreds of books, I'm wallowing in it as they
[00:16:56.579 --> 00:16:57.839]  Talk about us as animals.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.140]  They laugh at all the things they're going to do to us.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.901]  And I'm getting mad, folks!
[00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:17.146]  I'm getting mad when I see you all self-assured at the gym, or walking down the street, and you think you got it all figured out, and, man, the world's your oyster, and you have no idea this great evil is already up on top of us, and it's getting worse by the minute, like gathering storm clouds.
[00:17:20.446 --> 00:17:25.871]  And it didn't used to bother me when some yuppie on a big, and I'm not knocking you if you're on a motorcycle, but it just seems like they're always on a motorcycle.
[00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:41.204]  They'll be on some $70,000, $80,000 Harley, ball-headed lawyer, you know, and they'll always wheel past me at a boat ramp, or on Congress, or, you know, just somewhere where you find yuppies, and they'll just go, hey, punk!
[00:17:42.064 --> 00:17:43.386]  How'd the black helicopter do?
[00:17:43.426 --> 00:17:46.148]  And then they'll laugh, and I'll see them drive off with a George Bush sticker.
[00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:51.864]  And I'm just like, man, that person's heard my show, they've seen it, and they're not going to check in on anything I'm saying.
[00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:54.404]  They're listening right now, and they are laughing, folks.
[00:17:55.104 --> 00:18:01.165]  They think that gives them power to laugh at the evil and just deny it while at the same time they accept it.
[00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:02.006]  Let me tell you something.
[00:18:02.426 --> 00:18:08.427]  The society is like that woman stabbed, bleeding, flopping around in her own pool of blood.
[00:18:08.447 --> 00:18:11.027]  The society is like that.
[00:18:11.247 --> 00:18:11.767]  Let me tell you something.
[00:18:11.787 --> 00:18:15.168]  The bankers wouldn't have devalued the dollar by more than half.
[00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:18.955]  Now, they've devalued it down 99 plus percent.
[00:18:19.815 --> 00:18:21.697]  Ron Paul keeps saying it's worth four cents.
[00:18:21.717 --> 00:18:23.338]  I actually looked it up.
[00:18:23.358 --> 00:18:24.639]  That's a seven-year-old number.
[00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:26.720]  It was down to three cents five years ago.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.761]  He's just being conservative.
[00:18:29.502 --> 00:18:32.864]  It's less than one cent now of what it was worth in 1913.
[00:18:33.725 --> 00:18:39.509]  But see, just in the last seven years, more than half of that depreciation has happened.
[00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:43.992]  See, once you jump off the cliff, you start accelerating downward.
[00:18:46.465 --> 00:18:47.766]  You understand how that works?
[00:18:49.106 --> 00:19:05.193]  And I know you're giggling and laughing and feeling real important right now because the television taught you with mammalian dynamics how to imprint and with certain key triggers with your little imaginary friends and the relationships you have with your four and a half hours of average TV watching a day.
[00:19:05.213 --> 00:19:06.414]  But those people aren't real.
[00:19:06.774 --> 00:19:08.215]  Those situations aren't real.
[00:19:08.675 --> 00:19:15.338]  You've all been trained how to basically be frozen at the level of nose-picking, booger-eating 11-year-olds.
[00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:28.555]  And you're in a real world, folks, with real people in black uniforms that want to line you up and put bullets through your little brains.
[00:19:30.076 --> 00:19:38.161]  This world is run by people that openly write policy papers how they want to release race weapons and kill most of the earth.
[00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.463]  The Vice President published that.
[00:19:42.521 --> 00:19:44.804]  This isn't a game, Yuppie!
[00:19:45.224 --> 00:19:47.046]  This is the real world!
[00:19:47.527 --> 00:19:50.410]  And you're in it, whether you like it or not!
[00:19:50.691 --> 00:20:00.882]  I'm going to come back, get into the dollar, get into the latest global push for taxation, right here in the U.S., as they try to push global warming tax.
[00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:06.572]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:08.983]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live with an urgent message regarding Ed and Elaine Brown and their brave stand against the IRS.
[00:21:09.663 --> 00:21:19.829]  Wtprn.com and gcnlive.com join together to organize and promote the Live Free or Die concert on Saturday, July 14th in Plainfield, New Hampshire.
[00:21:20.009 --> 00:21:30.654]  Aside from a day of great music from bands like Poker Face, Dave Van Clise, Blue Eyed Fools, Paperback Radio, and many more, the true purpose of this event is to come to the defense of Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:34.716]  Friends, we're also in need of donations to cover costs of staging this historic event.

[00:21:42.139 --> 00:21:51.830]  Join me, Randy Weaver, and more surprise guests on July 14th to become part of this effort to defend the Browns, as it is literally a matter of life and death.

[00:22:02.415 --> 00:22:04.897]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.438 --> 00:22:19.509]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion, and establish a world government?
[00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:29.438]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:04.903]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:05.523 --> 00:23:14.451]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.912 --> 00:23:22.098]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:28.317]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:14.273]  Hey, I'm ready to die.
[00:24:14.433 --> 00:24:16.114]  I don't want to die.
[00:24:16.234 --> 00:24:17.636]  I want to make that clear.
[00:24:17.676 --> 00:24:22.700]  But I'll count them because I know what I'm going up against.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.861]  Now let me amend that.
[00:24:24.001 --> 00:24:25.923]  I learn every day
[00:24:38.963 --> 00:24:41.805]  Just how evil these people are, and it blows me away.
[00:24:43.446 --> 00:24:56.273]  I mean, it brings me in my soul to my knees to think about the 200 million people the globalists murdered last century.
[00:24:57.373 --> 00:24:59.114]  We're talking about a lot of people.
[00:24:59.134 --> 00:25:00.335]  200 million.
[00:25:03.675 --> 00:25:07.617]  200 million.
[00:25:07.637 --> 00:25:08.858]  200 million.
[00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:16.342]  Words cannot describe how big that number is.
[00:25:16.522 --> 00:25:29.248]  Each one of those 200 million, a man, a woman, a child, a grandmother who'd given birth to children and who'd been there helping her daughter when she gave birth.
[00:25:29.608 --> 00:25:30.789]  People who'd worked long
[00:25:31.616 --> 00:25:46.288]  Hard lives, and have experiences, and who had made meals, and worked in factories, and worked in fields, and painted, and you know, made guitars, and pianos, and written poetry, who had lives just like you do.
[00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:55.355]  Little five-year-old children, two-year-old children, ten-year-old children who were full of joy.
[00:25:55.999 --> 00:26:15.616]  And had the light of God in their eyes, that sparkle of innate intelligence, snuffed out, starved to death, shot, worked to death, poisoned, burned up, bombed, gone, forever, murdered.
[00:26:16.657 --> 00:26:21.461]  You see, when Christ said, He that
[00:26:22.797 --> 00:26:27.059]  ...lays down his life for his brother will gain it, and he who tries to save his life will lose it.
[00:26:27.459 --> 00:26:29.480]  That isn't just figurative or spiritual.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.761]  Of course, everything Jesus said really had three meanings.
[00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:35.502]  Poetry, the most beautiful.
[00:26:39.663 --> 00:26:43.025]  But it was also talking about on this planet, in this world.
[00:26:43.665 --> 00:26:49.427]  If you've got a mass of people that only care about themselves,
[00:26:51.764 --> 00:26:55.545]  When everyone is only looking out for themselves, we are in a hell hole.
[00:26:55.685 --> 00:26:57.405]  Everything starts falling apart.
[00:26:57.745 --> 00:26:59.806]  You see, you think you're saving yourself.
[00:27:00.206 --> 00:27:10.488]  I've talked to so many of the quote, well-to-do, middle-class people, hippies, yuppies, trendies, punkies, black folks, it doesn't matter, Hispanics, it's all the same.
[00:27:10.768 --> 00:27:11.308]  Same spirit.
[00:27:12.708 --> 00:27:13.848]  I'm not going to worry about that.
[00:27:13.888 --> 00:27:16.449]  I'm going to go out and make me some money, so I can get me a
[00:27:17.196 --> 00:27:20.559]  More gadgets and more bling and more all of this stuff.
[00:27:20.579 --> 00:27:21.960]  It doesn't matter at the end of the day.
[00:27:26.404 --> 00:27:29.607]  So that they can feel important in front of other people that don't even care.
[00:27:31.869 --> 00:27:33.550]  I've learned that I don't like having nice things.
[00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:37.474]  I don't like being looked at and sized up and I don't like having to compare things.
[00:27:37.514 --> 00:27:42.258]  I mean I really now, I remember growing up going, what is this Jesus said, give up everything you own, it's a burden.
[00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:48.393]  Now I'm beginning to realize that money and things, for me, are only good like gas in an engine to fight the New World Order.
[00:27:49.173 --> 00:28:05.302]  It's only good so I can fly where I need to, to fight who I need to, so I can have the bandwidth to run our operations against the New World Order, so I can not have to spend all my time, I guess, grubbing around, just so I can spend my time in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:28:05.322 --> 00:28:06.343]  But other than that, it doesn't matter.
[00:28:06.923 --> 00:28:12.186]  But you've got these people that will literally, in the words of my grandfather, kill their grandma for a stick of bubblegum,
[00:28:14.733 --> 00:28:21.940]  Who could care less about anyone but themselves, literal sociopaths, now transferring, being warped into full-blown psychopaths.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.122]  A nation, a world, planet psychopath.
[00:28:25.443 --> 00:28:26.243]  Be a good name of a book.
[00:28:29.086 --> 00:28:40.096]  And... The point I'm trying to get at here is, a lot of people are into themselves and themselves only.
[00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:45.211]  And they think they get ahead by not caring about anyone but themselves.
[00:28:46.192 --> 00:28:50.914]  And in truth, you are committing yourself to a nightmare hell.
[00:28:52.755 --> 00:29:01.740]  And then when you stop caring about anybody but yourself, you stop being involved in politics, you stop wanting to know how government works, you stop even reading the newspaper, though it's propaganda.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.980]  Most of you don't even read newspapers.
[00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:05.081]  Most, the general public, not our audience.
[00:29:05.101 --> 00:29:08.663]  I know our audience voraciously does because you've gotten into reality.
[00:29:08.683 --> 00:29:10.084]  You know how addictive it is.
[00:29:11.147 --> 00:29:16.030]  You know how alive you are now that you don't watch television anymore or very limited amounts.
[00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.571]  I used to watch two hours a day.
[00:29:18.051 --> 00:29:19.993]  Just ten years ago I was still watching two hours a day.
[00:29:20.513 --> 00:29:20.893]  Not anymore.
[00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:23.455]  I might watch two hours a week and that's analyzing.
[00:29:25.136 --> 00:29:26.697]  I might go to a movie now once a month.
[00:29:27.341 --> 00:29:28.782]  And I'm cutting back more and more.
[00:29:29.062 --> 00:29:30.143]  And I'm more and more alive.
[00:29:30.203 --> 00:29:37.306]  My brain now literally has storms of activity and ideas and dynamic human spirit developing.
[00:29:37.326 --> 00:29:38.387]  And I'm just an average person.
[00:29:38.907 --> 00:29:39.968]  All of you can do that.
[00:29:40.468 --> 00:29:44.570]  All of you can be part of this wonderful life and all the mysteries of life.
[00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:49.053]  Instead, it's being stolen from you by those that traffic in men's souls.
[00:29:51.954 --> 00:29:52.955]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.975 --> 00:29:54.876]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.874 --> 00:29:58.655]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.896 --> 00:30:04.616]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:30:05.057 --> 00:30:10.718]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:30:11.218 --> 00:30:13.359]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:22.741]  These toxins enter our bodies and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:24.262]  With more than 500 vital functions,
[00:30:25.502 --> 00:30:33.768]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.

[00:30:37.191 --> 00:30:44.516]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.

[00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.653]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:31:06.973 --> 00:31:08.854]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:31:09.054 --> 00:31:12.096]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:31:12.276 --> 00:31:15.418]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:31:15.718 --> 00:31:17.559]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:31:17.839 --> 00:31:18.400]  We're good to go.
[00:31:34.293 --> 00:31:38.616]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:31:38.936 --> 00:31:43.199]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:49.403]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[00:31:49.704 --> 00:31:52.125]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[00:31:52.325 --> 00:31:52.866]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:52.906 --> 00:31:53.946]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[00:32:01.966 --> 00:32:06.010]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.633]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.813 --> 00:32:13.336]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:13.556 --> 00:32:16.759]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.779 --> 00:32:22.304]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we've seen.
[00:32:22.344 --> 00:32:27.489]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:31.951]  Well, going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:32.071 --> 00:32:33.451]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:32:33.471 --> 00:32:38.913]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:32:39.354 --> 00:32:43.835]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:45.196]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:45.416 --> 00:32:48.879]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:48.899 --> 00:32:49.800]  That toll free number again?
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:49.880]  1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:23.883 --> 00:33:25.304]  Welcome back!
[00:33:27.025 --> 00:33:37.532]  Alright, I'm going to try to blast through news instead of just ranting.
[00:33:53.567 --> 00:33:55.069]  I've got comments on 9-11 Truth.
[00:33:55.109 --> 00:33:55.909]  We're itch going.
[00:33:55.989 --> 00:33:58.612]  I've got a host of issues I want to talk about.
[00:33:58.652 --> 00:33:59.893]  I'm going to try to condense them down.
[00:34:00.694 --> 00:34:03.836]  Coming up is Richard Gage, Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[00:34:04.477 --> 00:34:12.244]  For the first 30 minutes of the next hour, then Jerome Corsi about how they're planning to introduce into the full house North American Union legislation.
[00:34:13.525 --> 00:34:14.866]  Could be as early as this fall.
[00:34:16.308 --> 00:34:19.911]  And then of course, in the third hour, Michael Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:34:20.859 --> 00:34:23.660]  Over his monthly visit with us from Hawaii.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.301]  So that is coming up.
[00:34:27.801 --> 00:34:31.222]  I did want to take some time out to tell you about a couple of our different sponsors.
[00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:32.962]  One of them is eFoods Direct.
[00:34:34.023 --> 00:34:41.065]  They are the longest running, continually running food company in the United States.
[00:34:42.025 --> 00:34:44.405]  I have bought food from them many years ago.
[00:34:44.425 --> 00:34:50.107]  I didn't even know that when I approached them about being a sponsor, when I got another year's supply of food from them.
[00:34:51.258 --> 00:34:55.602]  And they're just wonderful people, and this is what they do.
[00:34:56.502 --> 00:34:57.443]  This is the business they're in.
[00:34:57.463 --> 00:34:59.505]  They're not one of these fly-by-night groups.
[00:34:59.945 --> 00:35:02.827]  High-quality, clean food, 99% organic.
[00:35:03.448 --> 00:35:08.592]  If they had everything certified, it's basically impossible to get the real certifications, but almost all of it's organic.
[00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:13.176]  The word he uses is clean food, no fillers, high-quality ingredients.
[00:35:14.477 --> 00:35:17.099]  And it's simple.
[00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:19.721]  New Orleans, they didn't have food, they went to the FEMA camp.
[00:35:21.914 --> 00:35:26.157]  It's how they will control you, and you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:35:27.238 --> 00:35:33.922]  And I've got 8-year-old food, I've got 5-year-old food, and I've got 3-month-old food.
[00:35:33.942 --> 00:35:36.043]  It's really that simple.
[00:35:37.064 --> 00:35:38.125]  I guess 4-month-old food now.
[00:35:39.205 --> 00:35:42.387]  It lasts 10 years, 10 years conservatively.
[00:35:42.447 --> 00:35:44.349]  If you stored it in a cool place, it could last 15 years.
[00:35:45.675 --> 00:35:46.977]  And it's of the highest quality.
[00:35:47.037 --> 00:35:47.778]  Give them a call.
[00:35:47.798 --> 00:35:48.359]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:48.439]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:48.960]  Just call.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:49.680]  Talk to them.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.762]  Get one of their brochures.
[00:35:50.782 --> 00:35:51.883]  1-800-409-5633 or efooddirect.com.
[00:35:51.943 --> 00:35:52.905]  Online at efooddirect.com.
[00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:08.511]  Also, we have another great sponsor, and that's Research Herbs.
[00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:09.971]  Researchherbs.com.
[00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:14.332]  Hundreds of great, well-documented herbal formulas and products.
[00:36:14.452 --> 00:36:19.753]  These are historically well-documented and really good quality at low prices.
[00:36:20.313 --> 00:36:21.574]  Researchherbs.com.
[00:36:21.594 --> 00:36:21.714]  1-800-845-3841.
[00:36:21.734 --> 00:36:29.475]  Just check out their website, researchherbs.com, or all our sponsors' banners on prisonplanet.com on the right-hand side.
[00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:32.576]  Live52 is the world's best-selling liver support formula.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.380]  And it's an incredible detox.
[00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:37.841]  Endorsed by over 200,000 health care professionals.
[00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:39.681]  An herbal registered drug in over 45 countries.
[00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:43.682]  LIV52 has clinically proven to be very beneficial for the liver.
[00:36:43.702 --> 00:36:48.583]  1-800-845-3841 or researchherbs.com.
[00:36:49.283 --> 00:36:58.425]  And in closing here with these messages that make this broadcast possible, by the way, I have made 15 films.
[00:37:00.226 --> 00:37:01.046]  Now you could say I guess 15
[00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:23.582]  and a half, because I wouldn't say I've made a new film with Terror Storm Special Edition, but it is 17 minutes of added footage on 9-11-7-7, you know, the whole thing with BBC saying that Building 7 fell before it had, and CNN, that's all documented, that's like four minutes of the 17 new minutes.
[00:37:24.303 --> 00:37:25.744]  Ground Zero demonstration, historical,
[00:37:27.456 --> 00:37:30.058]  March 9-11 is an inside job that's like three or four minutes of it.
[00:37:30.118 --> 00:37:33.399]  It's got a bunch of other little vignettes in it that really beef the film up.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.562]  It's been remastered, more audio, more video added throughout the film.
[00:37:39.062 --> 00:37:50.669]  And you always rush to do a film and you wish you could go back and fix it up some and add some things and every one or two slight, not even errors, but things that could have been taken as errors, we change those, we fix those.
[00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:56.592]  And we're not above error here, but that's what it's all about here, trying to be better and better.
[00:37:57.543 --> 00:38:03.668]  And so this highly vetted film, vetted by you, over 7 million people watched it on Google and YouTube video.
[00:38:03.708 --> 00:38:04.609]  That's a conservative number.
[00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:05.670]  I've quit counting months ago.
[00:38:06.491 --> 00:38:08.752]  And so you all vetted it out and found a few problems in it.
[00:38:08.792 --> 00:38:09.353]  We fixed it.
[00:38:09.993 --> 00:38:10.794]  And it is released.
[00:38:10.874 --> 00:38:11.655]  Terror Storm.
[00:38:12.616 --> 00:38:13.436]  Special edition.
[00:38:14.257 --> 00:38:15.958]  It is now, let me see, 130 plus minutes.
[00:38:20.535 --> 00:38:29.244]  And with 68 minutes, I don't know, it's well over 3 hours, I don't know how, 3 hours 15 minutes or something with the extras on one DVD.
[00:38:29.304 --> 00:38:31.546]  Now available at InfoWars.com.
[00:38:31.586 --> 00:38:32.146]  Get TerrorStorm.
[00:38:32.907 --> 00:38:36.050]  By the way, it's going to be going up Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:40.855]  Wednesday or Thursday on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[00:38:42.176 --> 00:38:44.038]  You can download it there in super high quality.
[00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:53.392]  And we are trying, we are shooting, because we had this before, but we had like three or four servers and it kept causing problems, allowing folks to stream it.
[00:38:53.712 --> 00:38:54.852]  We want to give you the best we can.
[00:38:55.393 --> 00:39:02.914]  We've tried to find the best new Flash we can, the best encoding systems, thousands of dollars in software, thousands of dollars in servers.
[00:39:04.014 --> 00:39:07.135]  And so we're going to be doing kind of a test run here for presentplanet.tv members.
[00:39:07.515 --> 00:39:09.575]  You're still going to have the downloads, which work just fine.
[00:39:09.595 --> 00:39:12.536]  At peak times, decent connection rates.
[00:39:12.576 --> 00:39:15.116]  When it didn't peak times, really fast connection download rates.
[00:39:17.322 --> 00:39:26.649]  But we've got two servers now, and we're going to be trying to stream it to you in Flash, so you can get a really high quality version of it.
[00:39:27.009 --> 00:39:30.532]  So you'll be able to get it in streaming, in Flash, and in download.
[00:39:30.552 --> 00:39:31.653]  We're trying to bring that back.
[00:39:32.113 --> 00:39:35.416]  But we're testing it with the release of this, so we'll see what happens.
[00:39:36.317 --> 00:39:39.459]  But we've actually got two new servers now.
[00:39:39.799 --> 00:39:40.300]  Or is it three?
[00:39:41.744 --> 00:39:52.754]  We've got a test account with one, some ridiculous amount of terabytes, like terabyte connections and stuff, but we'll see, because what happens is all of you have shared your passcode.
[00:39:53.195 --> 00:39:57.258]  We don't have that many members, but everyone shared their passcode, which is fine with me.
[00:39:57.358 --> 00:40:06.387]  My goal is to get it out, but just maybe be judicious about who you give the passcode to, because they just keep adding servers and servers until
[00:40:07.228 --> 00:40:19.052]  The website is getting close to not paying for itself if we get many more servers, but it's actually paying for the webmasters and people right now, but it could get into a danger point if I just keep having to add server after server after server after server.
[00:40:19.692 --> 00:40:21.193]  This is not inexpensive.
[00:40:21.453 --> 00:40:30.776]  Alright, I'm already digressing and I said I have all this news to get off into, but PrisonPlanet.tv, if you haven't renewed your membership or you've never gotten a membership, go get it, because Terrorist Corp.
[00:40:30.796 --> 00:40:31.396]  Special Edition
[00:40:32.468 --> 00:40:36.052]  It's already been uploaded to the site, the download version, so we'll definitely have that up by Wednesday.
[00:40:36.412 --> 00:40:41.638]  But by the weekend, let me hedge my bet here, we'll have the streaming Flash up there for you.
[00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:49.525]  This new Flash looks really good, so we're trying to bring you a better viewing experience.
[00:40:52.248 --> 00:40:53.830]  Let me just blast through the news here.
[00:40:55.072 --> 00:40:57.214]  Euro hits new high against U.S.
[00:40:57.274 --> 00:40:57.654]  dollar.
[00:40:57.754 --> 00:41:05.080]  Euro soars to $1.37 mark, trading an all-time high on concerns about U.S.
[00:41:05.441 --> 00:41:06.321]  housing market.
[00:41:08.063 --> 00:41:09.784]  Now, that's the over-lending.
[00:41:10.985 --> 00:41:15.729]  But it's the very central banks, Chase, Manhattan, Citibank, that own the predominant Federal Reserve.
[00:41:15.749 --> 00:41:18.051]  They're owned by Bank of England.
[00:41:19.492 --> 00:41:23.215]  Notice they've made their home country currency the strongest in the world, the British pound sterling.
[00:41:26.357 --> 00:41:30.339]  You notice that then they run around as holier than thou.
[00:41:31.099 --> 00:41:43.563]  They've kept the economy going, though it was on debt for the last 15 years or so, really the last 7 or 8 at full tilt boogie, by giving loans to anybody, mainly arms, adjustable rate mortgages.
[00:41:45.344 --> 00:41:46.465]  And now they're calling them in.
[00:41:47.685 --> 00:41:52.387]  And now the big central banks, who had the callings in the 1913 and 1933 and in the 40s and 50s and 60s, 70s and 80s,
[00:41:56.283 --> 00:42:00.466]  There's basically very few independent banks that are left out there who aren't narcotics traffickers.
[00:42:00.907 --> 00:42:07.292]  Any medium-sized banks you see out there are really just CIA or big corporation drug laundering fronts.
[00:42:07.852 --> 00:42:11.375]  So really there's not many independent companies left.
[00:42:11.876 --> 00:42:17.220]  I mean there's brokers who claim their banks or claim their mortgage lenders, but they're just brokering deals.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.044]  They're just errand boys, paper stampers, paper shifters.
[00:42:23.115 --> 00:42:32.302]  So the globalists have gotten the economy to the point where more than 75% of the economy and of government investments have been made into private, optional corporations.
[00:42:32.342 --> 00:42:36.385]  So the foreign corporations own the government, own the investments of the government.
[00:42:36.946 --> 00:42:38.307]  By the way, that number is two years old.
[00:42:38.327 --> 00:42:41.189]  Where does that number come from?
[00:42:41.229 --> 00:42:47.814]  Walter Berian doing an index look at it, commodities and exchange trader, and then of course the former auditor of the Air Force.
[00:42:48.735 --> 00:42:54.841]  The head accountant for the Air Force, the manager of the accounts for the Air Force, the city manager of the Air Force.
[00:42:55.321 --> 00:42:56.182]  Very important position.
[00:42:56.542 --> 00:42:59.285]  He looked at it and found out it was true, and he's released similar numbers.
[00:42:59.305 --> 00:43:01.186]  A couple years ago they said 75.
[00:43:01.547 --> 00:43:10.495]  They haven't crunched them since then, but projections are we're at 80 plus percent, because then it starts really accelerating, of everything owned by foreign-owned corporations.
[00:43:10.795 --> 00:43:12.236]  I mean, I mean the government is!
[00:43:13.738 --> 00:43:13.978]  Okay?
[00:43:15.808 --> 00:43:17.669]  Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[00:43:17.709 --> 00:43:18.749]  That's the double set of books.
[00:43:18.789 --> 00:43:21.410]  They're totally public, but literally 1 in 100 people know about it.
[00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:22.770]  It's like an open secret.
[00:43:24.071 --> 00:43:27.272]  A cop listening, a police detective right now could verify this in 20 minutes.
[00:43:27.632 --> 00:43:28.152]  But you won't.
[00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:29.052]  You'll just deny it.
[00:43:29.272 --> 00:43:29.752]  I understand.
[00:43:29.772 --> 00:43:31.693]  It feels better to do it that way.
[00:43:31.833 --> 00:43:32.833]  So, that's fine.
[00:43:32.953 --> 00:43:33.413]  That's fine.
[00:43:34.074 --> 00:43:34.894]  You want to live like this?
[00:43:34.914 --> 00:43:35.694]  You want this to happen?
[00:43:35.934 --> 00:43:36.674]  It's your choice.
[00:43:37.395 --> 00:43:38.595]  Don't say you weren't warned.
[00:43:39.378 --> 00:43:41.220]  And so now they don't need an economy anymore.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.821]  They don't need a quote free market anymore.
[00:43:43.302 --> 00:43:51.049]  All of this issuance of credit was to get you strung out like a heroin addict as much as they could right to the edge of oblivion.
[00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:55.292]  I mean right up to the razor's edge.
[00:43:56.413 --> 00:43:57.474]  Totally extended.
[00:43:58.215 --> 00:44:02.519]  Now remember we passed in January of this year a number we've never had in the US history.
[00:44:03.553 --> 00:44:10.876]  A deeper debt versus assets ratio than late November 15th was the previous record.
[00:44:11.276 --> 00:44:17.438]  November 15th, 1933 was the absolute depths.
[00:44:17.918 --> 00:44:21.859]  Three years into the depression, total bankruptcy, everything falling apart.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.501]  We had a better debt versus assets ratio.
[00:44:28.755 --> 00:44:33.577]  In January, it passed that, and since then, has gone way past it.
[00:44:34.518 --> 00:44:36.919]  I mean, it's like a funny car on a nitrous oxide.
[00:44:37.239 --> 00:44:38.399]  It's blown past everything.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:39.500]  Boom!
[00:44:43.041 --> 00:44:44.062]  And what are the feds doing?
[00:44:44.242 --> 00:44:48.084]  They are putting billboards up everywhere with federal funds to hire more cops.
[00:44:48.104 --> 00:44:53.266]  They're federalizing local police departments under FBI command centers and CIA command centers.
[00:44:53.286 --> 00:44:56.147]  They're building FEMA camps everywhere as fast as they can.
[00:44:56.467 --> 00:44:58.128]  They're getting the police trained in riot.
[00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:00.561]  I'm telling them bad stuff's coming.
[00:45:01.983 --> 00:45:12.198]  But they won't do it unless their supercomputers and their wargamers and their tacticians have got at least a 70% chance of you going along with it and being successful.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:22.662]  They want limited riots and limited freak-outs, but they want people to at least blame whatever young CEO they're going to claim did the trade that caused the collapse.
[00:45:22.682 --> 00:45:24.222]  I mean, they always do the same trick.
[00:45:24.282 --> 00:45:32.623]  It'll be some guy in Malaysia, or some guy in London did it, or some guy in Peking did it, or somebody in Tokyo, or somebody in Johannesburg.
[00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:40.745]  I mean, this is a Brasilia that caused the trigger, or terrorists blew something up and then that caused the trigger.
[00:45:41.548 --> 00:45:43.811]  Or a storm hit some refineries and that caused a trigger.
[00:45:44.772 --> 00:45:48.336]  They usually like to have a person they can blame and trot out and give 10 years in prison.
[00:45:48.576 --> 00:45:49.778]  They'll have nothing to do with it, of course.
[00:45:50.258 --> 00:45:51.840]  Maybe they'll be doing unscrupulous things, of course.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:52.601]  That's part of the system.
[00:45:54.343 --> 00:45:56.025]  And they'll come out and they'll trigger this.
[00:45:56.733 --> 00:46:04.922]  And then you see, then they get to run around and act all official, and have the very people behind it all sit there and give you the new answers.
[00:46:05.042 --> 00:46:06.724]  Oh, now we're in this deep trouble.
[00:46:07.025 --> 00:46:08.046]  Here's what you do.
[00:46:08.126 --> 00:46:14.353]  This is who's responsible, and here's the experts that are going to save you, and here's the experts that warned of this.
[00:46:14.893 --> 00:46:36.225]  You notice Greenspan for three years has been warning, and Bernanke's been warning, and the International Bank of Settlements two weeks ago said, oh, global depression, and Joseph Stiklitz four years ago, let me see, 2002, five years ago, said it's all going to happen, and is positioning himself that, oh, it was this brand of globalism caused it, not this other brand.
[00:46:37.546 --> 00:46:39.647]  We've had him on, here on the show, a Nobel Prize winner.
[00:46:40.879 --> 00:46:43.861]  So they're all positioning and hedging right now.
[00:46:43.962 --> 00:46:55.150]  The general public has no idea what even hedging is, or just in the basic sense, or what currency valuations or devaluations mean, appreciations, depreciations.
[00:46:55.571 --> 00:46:59.194]  They have no idea what prime rates are, what Federal Reserve rates are.
[00:46:59.474 --> 00:47:02.957]  They have no idea what inflation is, or if they do, it just means things cost more.
[00:47:02.977 --> 00:47:05.639]  I mean, they claim inflation's at 5.4%.
[00:47:05.819 --> 00:47:05.939]  It's 13.6%.
[00:47:10.234 --> 00:47:12.915]  And that is being issued by the big brokerage houses.
[00:47:12.935 --> 00:47:13.855]  It's probably more like 20%.
[00:47:14.555 --> 00:47:17.236]  I mean, it's, uh, but the eggs are still the same price.
[00:47:18.437 --> 00:47:24.178]  They're very careful, and they have even got papers with the Globals right about that, about keep the milk and eggs low, keep the basics.
[00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:26.839]  But a car that was 10 grands, 40 grand.
[00:47:27.399 --> 00:47:29.360]  A house that was 200 thousands a million.
[00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:32.581]  Gas is doubled in prices.
[00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:38.463]  And as the dollars evaluate, they're now telling you, ooh, get ready for it to go up even more!
[00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.833]  See, listen to this.
[00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:44.874]  This is Frankfurt, Germany Associated Press.
[00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:57.986]  The Euro soared their 137 mark for the first time on Tuesday, trading as high as $1.37.16 amid concerns about U.S.
[00:47:58.126 --> 00:47:58.987]  housing market.
[00:47:59.587 --> 00:48:05.713]  The 13-nation currency hit the new high before falling back a bit.
[00:48:06.756 --> 00:48:08.737]  It was up from previous record of 1.3682.
[00:48:09.417 --> 00:48:14.659]  It brought on April 27th above the 1.3623.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.200]  It brought late Monday in New York.
[00:48:19.921 --> 00:48:22.102]  The dollar's drop came as U.S.
[00:48:22.462 --> 00:48:27.604]  stocks fell in early trading as Wall Street nervously awaited a speech from U.S.
[00:48:27.624 --> 00:48:34.907]  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the CEO of the private family bank that owns America.
[00:48:36.736 --> 00:48:40.339]  And has brought up our governments and has the tax money directly transferred to them.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.843]  And if you don't like it, they've trained legions of people that watch Jack Bauer and want to torture.
[00:48:44.863 --> 00:48:45.203]  Okay?
[00:48:46.624 --> 00:48:47.885]  The dollar's drop came as U.S.
[00:48:47.905 --> 00:48:53.590]  stocks fell in early trading as Wall Street nervously awaited a speech of Federal Reserve Chairman, our owner, Ben Bernanke.
[00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:58.494]  And reacting to troubled forecasts from retailers Home Depot and Sears.
[00:48:58.694 --> 00:49:00.095]  Oh, that's why this is all happening.
[00:49:00.155 --> 00:49:00.715]  Sure it is.
[00:49:01.196 --> 00:49:04.979]  Bernanke is expected to speak on inflation later Tuesday in Massachusetts.
[00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:14.155]  And any indication that he believes prices and pressures and rising could heighten worries about possible interest rate increase and give the stock market a jolt.
[00:49:15.896 --> 00:49:17.216]  Meanwhile, Home Depot, Inc.
[00:49:17.276 --> 00:49:18.557]  and Sears Holdings Corp.
[00:49:19.058 --> 00:49:28.003]  offer disappointing financial onlookers that raise concerns about whether corporate America's future performance will give stocks the boost investors have hoping for.
[00:49:28.223 --> 00:49:30.164]  This is all lies and all spin.
[00:49:30.891 --> 00:49:32.432]  I mean, let's just take this last line.
[00:49:32.532 --> 00:49:33.273]  Here's the problem.
[00:49:33.313 --> 00:49:35.674]  I see like 20, 30 lies here.
[00:49:35.714 --> 00:49:36.435]  I'm not exaggerating.
[00:49:37.295 --> 00:49:38.936]  Every word combo is a lie.
[00:49:39.056 --> 00:49:41.098]  Every way they lay it out is a lie.
[00:49:42.699 --> 00:49:45.821]  You can always tell these key financial reports are written by spooks, folks.
[00:49:46.841 --> 00:49:55.787]  By the way, declassified in the late 70s that all the top AP people are Defense Intelligence, CIA, or private liaisons funded by intelligence agencies.
[00:49:56.579 --> 00:49:58.760]  I don't mean your local field filer.
[00:49:59.161 --> 00:50:01.322]  I mean the key editors and the key financial reporters.
[00:50:01.342 --> 00:50:07.266]  Remember, it was AP that was over announcing who'd won elections all those years very quietly.
[00:50:11.168 --> 00:50:13.149]  Let me read to you this propaganda.
[00:50:13.669 --> 00:50:15.190]  What was the big lie I was saying?
[00:50:18.052 --> 00:50:19.113]  The last lie I was on.
[00:50:19.133 --> 00:50:22.915]  I have to re-read this to... Oh, let's just say they're telling the truth.
[00:50:22.935 --> 00:50:23.335]  They love us.
[00:50:23.375 --> 00:50:23.856]  Everything's fine.
[00:50:23.876 --> 00:50:24.496]  How does that sound?
[00:50:26.637 --> 00:50:36.524]  Bernanke is expected to speak on inflation later Tuesday in Massachusetts and any indication that he believes price pressures are rising could heighten worries and possible interest rates and give the stock market a jolt.
[00:50:38.545 --> 00:50:39.826]  We'll come back, talk more about it.
[00:50:40.527 --> 00:50:43.529]  There's so many lies, I started spinning around on the page there.
[00:50:43.549 --> 00:50:45.270]  I don't even know where to start.
[00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:46.831]  I'm like a dog in a butcher shop.
[00:50:47.351 --> 00:50:51.835]  Which steak to bite into next?
[00:50:52.075 --> 00:50:53.696]  It confounds
[00:50:54.904 --> 00:50:56.325]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:56.545 --> 00:50:56.965]  Stay with me.
[00:51:00.547 --> 00:51:05.529]  It's here.
[00:51:05.749 --> 00:51:10.531]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.891 --> 00:51:18.535]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.238 --> 00:51:26.280]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.681 --> 00:51:38.124]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.424 --> 00:51:41.886]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.386 --> 00:51:44.326]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.647 --> 00:51:48.488]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.698 --> 00:52:04.699]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:09.942]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:10.202 --> 00:52:14.544]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.844 --> 00:52:23.768]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.968 --> 00:52:27.590]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:32.895]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:33.196 --> 00:52:39.903]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:40.413 --> 00:52:41.074]  What about you?
[00:52:41.714 --> 00:52:47.079]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:01.644 --> 00:53:03.364]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.585 --> 00:53:07.286]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.606 --> 00:53:09.826]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:10.326 --> 00:53:16.528]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.688 --> 00:53:21.609]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:30.752]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:25.868 --> 00:54:31.551]  Some yuppie, and that's unfair to say all yuppies, you know what I mean, the trendies.
[00:54:32.372 --> 00:54:33.512]  They're on top of the world.
[00:54:33.552 --> 00:54:39.496]  They like, remember when you were like five years old or three years old, you'd play imaginary games like you were a knight or cowboys and Indians?
[00:54:40.336 --> 00:54:42.437]  I've studied the psychology of these full-grown adults.
[00:54:43.178 --> 00:54:44.719]  They are in like wonderland.
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.301]  It's like they're fooling themselves.
[00:54:48.341 --> 00:54:50.902]  You know that childlike idea or feeling?
[00:54:50.922 --> 00:54:53.944]  When I was three, I consciously, standing on the front porch,
[00:54:54.582 --> 00:55:01.106]  On a bright, sunny day, I realized that what I thought wasn't the world, that I wasn't the world, that make-believe wasn't real.
[00:55:01.126 --> 00:55:05.169]  It was a jolting experience.
[00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:09.852]  But then I realized that most adults, that's why they like to dress up.
[00:55:09.912 --> 00:55:11.493]  It's why people like to pose.
[00:55:11.553 --> 00:55:11.974]  It's for them.
[00:55:12.274 --> 00:55:12.974]  See, it's a power trip.
[00:55:16.542 --> 00:55:25.449]  And so the yuppie called up and found one of the extensions of some back line of the network and told somebody answering the phone that, oh, the yuppies are listening and we're laughing.
[00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:31.654]  No, you're calling in because deep down you're afraid, just like the little child you are.
[00:55:33.095 --> 00:55:33.556]  That's good.
[00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:38.860]  We've, we've, uh, of course with a yuppie though, it's, it's like a power trip that we talk so much about him.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.902]  It's like a feeling of satisfaction.
[00:55:40.922 --> 00:55:43.404]  Oh, look, he's, he's talking about us.
[00:55:43.424 --> 00:55:44.865]  We're powerful.
[00:55:48.065 --> 00:55:49.346]  Yeah, you're going to be real powerful.
[00:55:49.366 --> 00:55:50.927]  They bring us into a global depression.
[00:55:51.528 --> 00:55:54.029]  No, you'll go get a job working for the system.
[00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.810]  We understand.
[00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:56.171]  You think you're going to make money off of it.
[00:55:57.172 --> 00:55:57.872]  I understand that.
[00:55:58.553 --> 00:56:00.774]  But you'll have a son or a daughter who gets hurt by the system.
[00:56:01.255 --> 00:56:05.678]  You'll be too stupid to realize it was what you've done coming back on you when it does happen.
[00:56:13.604 --> 00:56:16.046]  Euro hits new high against the dollar.
[00:56:16.266 --> 00:56:18.128]  Let me just get to this, because I've got guests coming up.
[00:56:18.188 --> 00:56:20.149]  This is Robert Kennedy, Jr.
[00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:24.553]  at the Live Earth Global Push for Taxation.
[00:56:26.374 --> 00:56:34.461]  And just like the European Union officially said two weeks ago, that you are a terrorist if you deny global warming.
[00:56:34.581 --> 00:56:35.522]  That's a headline.
[00:56:36.322 --> 00:56:37.603]  Well, here it's from their own mouth.
[00:56:37.643 --> 00:56:39.105]  We're treasonous traders, too.
[00:56:39.545 --> 00:56:42.047]  See, it's the new global religion of feudalism.
[00:56:42.742 --> 00:56:49.189]  And eugenics, feudalism was repackaged as eugenics, now eugenics has been repackaged as modern environmentalism.
[00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:53.233]  Now understand, they expropriate in things that make sense.
[00:56:53.673 --> 00:56:58.778]  I'm not saying if you're an environmentalist you're bad, I'm saying those running the movements are eugenicists.
[00:56:59.539 --> 00:56:59.939]  Here it is.
[00:57:02.962 --> 00:57:03.463]  Not excited?
[00:57:06.577 --> 00:57:09.099]  Or then buying a fuel-efficient automobile.
[00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:18.347]  The most important thing you can do is to get involved in the political process and get rid of all these rotten politicians that we have in Washington, D.C.
[00:57:25.444 --> 00:57:31.846]  Who are nothing more than corporate codies for companies like Exxon and Southern Company.
[00:57:32.266 --> 00:57:42.549]  These villainous companies that consistently put their private financial interests ahead of American interests and ahead of the interests of all of humanity.
[00:57:43.569 --> 00:57:47.991]  This is treason and we need to start treating them now as traitors.
[00:57:48.891 --> 00:57:49.191]  Okay.
[00:57:50.277 --> 00:57:52.017]  Alright, notice, it sounds good.
[00:57:52.037 --> 00:57:56.718]  I mean, these evil corporations, these global corporations, Exxon, everybody knows they're very corrupt.
[00:57:58.299 --> 00:58:01.179]  But, that's just like when Rothschild was on, he started calling me an oil baron.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.041]  Just out of the blue, when his family has some of the biggest oil holdings in the world, including the British arm, owns Yukos Oil.
[00:58:09.441 --> 00:58:10.181]  Owns Russian oil.
[00:58:10.461 --> 00:58:11.962]  That's come out in the Financial Times of London.
[00:58:13.362 --> 00:58:17.183]  I mean, you got the heir to a fortune that owns the Russian oil alone.
[00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:23.304]  Huge stakes in British Petroleum, Dutch Royal Shell, Anglo-American Oil.
[00:58:26.386 --> 00:58:28.088]  I mean, folks, I'm lower middle class.
[00:58:28.928 --> 00:58:38.895]  Oh, no, I'm an oil baron because I, see, just like the Federal Reserve financed newspapers across the country to claim the bankers were against the Federal Reserve Act when they actually wrote it.
[00:58:38.995 --> 00:58:39.876]  See how they fooled you?
[00:58:42.077 --> 00:58:46.300]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7000.
[00:58:52.287 --> 00:58:58.088]  Interesting.
[00:58:58.288 --> 00:58:58.908]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.588 --> 00:59:00.689]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.369 --> 00:59:02.509]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.129 --> 00:59:03.949]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:06.610]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:10.291]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.451 --> 00:59:14.531]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.413 --> 00:59:25.355]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:59:25.375 --> 00:59:26.276]  We're scheduled.
[00:59:26.676 --> 00:59:31.639]  We have Richard Gage, Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, joining us and Jerome Corsi in 30 minutes.
[00:59:31.679 --> 00:59:34.521]  In the third hour, Mike Rivera will open the phones up, too.
[00:59:34.561 --> 00:59:36.382]  And Mike Rivera is on with us.
[00:59:36.402 --> 00:59:40.204]  Last hour, I spoke a lot about the Euro hits new high against the U.S.
[00:59:40.264 --> 00:59:40.624]  dollar.
[00:59:40.684 --> 00:59:43.987]  The Euro soars to 137 mark.
[00:59:45.307 --> 00:59:48.009]  And the Euro rose from a low of 82 U.S.
[00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.850]  cents in October 2000.
[00:59:50.695 --> 01:00:17.667]  to now $1.37 and rising, it's rising about a half cent a week and that continues well according to yuppies that's a good thing to have a devalued currency to have your money in your bank devalued by more than half in just six years is a wonderful wonderful thing okay fine your government loves you also Democrats are saying climate
[01:00:18.425 --> 01:00:24.010]  Clash heads to floor as they push for a carbon tax, which does nothing about real environmental problems we face.
[01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:28.033]  A Republican rebellion over Iraq escalates, that's good news, it's happening.
[01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:36.020]  Turkey is amassing 140,000 troops on the border with Iraq and Kurdistan, what they like to be Kurdistan.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:44.086]  Remember at Bilderberg Group, that was the big topic of would Turkey invade, and that hadn't even been in the news up until then, and now it is.
[01:00:44.566 --> 01:00:46.208]  Some more inside info we brought you here.
[01:00:47.097 --> 01:00:49.459]  Oil experts see supply crisis in five years.
[01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:52.441]  Big oil companies are telling you there's no oil left with peak oil.
[01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:54.322]  It's called artificial scarcity.
[01:00:54.342 --> 01:00:56.124]  It's like the De Beers and Diamonds.
[01:00:56.144 --> 01:00:58.565]  There's too much of it, so they're saying there's not enough of it.
[01:00:59.106 --> 01:01:00.527]  Oil companies wrote up the propaganda.
[01:01:00.547 --> 01:01:01.808]  Greg Powell's got the documents.
[01:01:02.628 --> 01:01:05.270]  Senators' numbers on escort service.
[01:01:06.671 --> 01:01:09.273]  That's Senator David Vetter, Republican, Louisiana.
[01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:13.236]  I think the Bushes and people are mad because it's not a gay escort.
[01:01:14.745 --> 01:01:21.547]  Because all the male madams and male prostitutes, that's Bush and Roe and all them like that.
[01:01:21.567 --> 01:01:22.207]  That's their business.
[01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:23.408]  I'm not attacking them for that.
[01:01:23.428 --> 01:01:27.229]  I mean, it is illegal, but, you know, I mean, that's their personal preference.
[01:01:28.129 --> 01:01:36.372]  At the White House, hundreds of male prostitutes, and of course, Bohemian Grove as well, and Nixon, of course, spoke about that, and we have the tape of him talking about it, about what they were into.
[01:01:37.592 --> 01:01:42.374]  But, I mean, are they mad at Senator David Vetter that he was a female?
[01:01:42.394 --> 01:01:43.414]  Does he like females?
[01:01:44.304 --> 01:01:45.425]  He's not in the club or something?
[01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:50.788]  Of course, it's terrible that he's doing this, and it shows how they're blackmailed and controlled.
[01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:57.813]  But compared to four trillion missing from the Pentagon, and all the other things that are going on, this kind of stuff is a distraction.
[01:01:58.334 --> 01:02:04.918]  And of course, there's supposedly a bunch of names on there, they're just doling this one out, and I guarantee you, this is being used for blackmail right now in Congress.
[01:02:05.218 --> 01:02:10.502]  They're letting this one name come out when there's supposedly hundreds, just to get everybody a little more fear.
[01:02:11.463 --> 01:02:13.284]  Okay, it's gonna come out that
[01:02:14.224 --> 01:02:17.826]  You know, you like the male porn stars to drop by.
[01:02:17.846 --> 01:02:20.607]  Now, do you want that to come out, Senator?
[01:02:21.668 --> 01:02:21.888]  No.
[01:02:22.148 --> 01:02:24.209]  And by the way, make a deal with you.
[01:02:24.229 --> 01:02:27.691]  Send over three more and I won't vote against amnesty.
[01:02:28.552 --> 01:02:30.093]  I mean, that's how it works, folks.
[01:02:30.353 --> 01:02:36.296]  And it's amazing that, and of course I'm being
[01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:44.032]  sarcastic about a lot of this, but it really is true that they ship in hundreds of male prostitutes and gay porn stars and the rest of it.
[01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:47.972]  And it's Christian and conservative and neocon talk shows attack me for talking about it.
[01:02:48.613 --> 01:02:50.473]  And they say Bush is of the Lord.
[01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:53.734]  Well, okay, then.
[01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:58.355]  I just get confused sometimes, that's all.
[01:02:59.355 --> 01:03:03.116]  But I'm, I guess, beginning to realize that I'm just wrong about all this.
[01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:09.633]  Three die in chase as SUV jammed with 21 illegal aliens.
[01:03:10.774 --> 01:03:18.619]  Man, that's terrible that they're dead, and terrible that they ran from the police and their tire blew out, but a suburban with 21 illegal aliens packed in it.
[01:03:20.721 --> 01:03:24.723]  We'll go over that with Jerome Corsi as well, and also this story out of the LA Times.
[01:03:25.664 --> 01:03:29.927]  Mexican cartels outgunned towns, several towns in
[01:03:31.056 --> 01:03:32.537]  Texas, California, other areas.
[01:03:32.817 --> 01:03:33.638]  The police have just quit.
[01:03:33.658 --> 01:03:34.898]  They're no longer even police.
[01:03:35.299 --> 01:03:36.960]  Mexican military is already running things.
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:38.821]  That's in the mainstream news, by the way.
[01:03:39.041 --> 01:03:40.122]  So we'll get into that for you.
[01:03:41.663 --> 01:03:42.223]  But don't worry.
[01:03:42.263 --> 01:03:44.264]  Cops all over the country are beating up old women.
[01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:47.306]  Every few days I see an article about some old woman talks back.
[01:03:47.326 --> 01:03:50.548]  They just punch them right in the face and slam their face in the concrete.
[01:03:57.305 --> 01:03:57.766]  It's here!
[01:03:57.986 --> 01:04:02.754]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:03.135 --> 01:04:10.788]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:11.454 --> 01:04:18.517]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.917 --> 01:04:30.342]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.642 --> 01:04:34.164]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.624 --> 01:04:36.565]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.865 --> 01:04:40.727]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.964]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:04:59.024 --> 01:05:06.350]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:17.159]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:05:17.339 --> 01:05:21.883]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:22.143 --> 01:05:27.125]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:05:27.345 --> 01:05:30.286]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:30.506 --> 01:05:40.330]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:05:55.737 --> 01:05:59.860]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.841]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:08.405]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:08.686 --> 01:06:14.810]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:21.094]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:21.374 --> 01:06:27.778]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:06:27.918 --> 01:06:31.460]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.463]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.

[01:06:38.324 --> 01:06:39.385]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:39.665 --> 01:06:40.706]  Eliminate the cause!

[01:06:53.863 --> 01:06:58.887]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:59.267 --> 01:07:01.549]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:23.413 --> 01:07:29.587]  Alright, we got Richard Gage with 18 major points to make about the collapse of the World Trade Center in a short time to get there.
[01:07:30.436 --> 01:07:36.580]  Richard Gage, AIA, is a founding member of AE911truth.org.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:44.024]  He has a practicing architect for 20 years and has worked on most types of building construction, including numerous fireproof steel-framed buildings.
[01:07:44.484 --> 01:07:55.991]  He is employed with a San Francisco Bay Area architecture firm and has most recently performed construction administration services on a new $120 million high school campus, including a $10 million steel-framed
[01:07:56.571 --> 01:08:08.941]  Building gymnasium currently is working on the design development for a very large mixed-use urban project with 1.2 million square foot of retail and 320 square feet of 320,000 square foot high-rise office space all together about 1,200 tons of steel framing.
[01:08:16.644 --> 01:08:17.365]  We're good to go.
[01:08:33.138 --> 01:08:44.167]  Well, we've got Corsi coming on with big North American Union news, but if I need to move Corsi back to 40 after or so, we will, so we can get these 18 points out and we'll have Mr. Gage back on in the near future.
[01:08:44.187 --> 01:08:48.190]  But out of the gates, you guys got a lot of engineers, a lot of architects,
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:53.204]  A lot of physicists, people in your group, and the media doesn't want to attack you guys.
[01:08:53.224 --> 01:08:54.505]  They don't want to give you any attention.
[01:08:54.866 --> 01:09:04.915]  They just want to keep claiming on Fox that small fires melt steel, and that the Easter Bunny pilots spaceships, and that tooth fairies do put money under your pillow.
[01:09:04.995 --> 01:09:08.758]  I mean, they're in a lot of trouble because the science here is going to tear them up.
[01:09:09.419 --> 01:09:10.280]  It really is, Alex.
[01:09:11.701 --> 01:09:14.704]  The truth speaks for itself, and we're talking about
[01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:38.933]  Very hard science, and I know many of your listeners are aware of many of the points I'm going to make, but for those who don't, let me share that we have an extraordinary array of physical evidence to share, and when we share this with the architects,
[01:09:39.825 --> 01:09:40.366]  They see it.
[01:09:40.686 --> 01:09:49.293]  I mean, about 70% of them, I would say, on average, will sign up on our website after seeing the... Well, let me just say this.
[01:09:49.634 --> 01:09:59.342]  I don't need to be an architect to look at buildings with classical Blast Point squibs shooting out and then have hundreds of firemen and police saying, they told us to get back, they were going to blow seven up.
[01:09:59.382 --> 01:10:07.209]  I mean, but for those that are doubters, here are the architects, here are the engineers who are saying about 70% win face with it, do not go in denial, go ahead.
[01:10:07.591 --> 01:10:17.736]  Yeah, and oddly enough, 30% do, because everything we're going to share with you challenges our deepest assumptions about the world and our government, and that is that it's safe.
[01:10:18.456 --> 01:10:21.498]  And it turns out not to be.
[01:10:21.598 --> 01:10:25.600]  It turns out that fires did not bring the Twin Towers or Building 7 down.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:34.004]  Building 7, as you know, was not hit by an airplane, and yet it exhibited all of the classic characteristics of a controlled demolition.
[01:10:34.628 --> 01:10:37.069]  And I'd like to just review those with you real quick.
[01:10:37.129 --> 01:10:41.752]  We have a rapid onset of collapse at the base of the building.
[01:10:42.312 --> 01:10:52.797]  We have sounds of explosions at the ground floor heard by a couple of different witnesses that we have recorded a full second prior to the collapse of the building.
[01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:58.420]  Including firemen and emergency workers hearing this.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.703]  We have a symmetrical collapse through the path of greatest resistance.
[01:11:02.763 --> 01:11:05.605]  That is all of the 81 columns in Building 7.
[01:11:06.705 --> 01:11:08.967]  And at free-fall speed virtually.
[01:11:08.987 --> 01:11:10.788]  We're talking six and a half seconds.
[01:11:11.028 --> 01:11:17.553]  A half a second over free-fall speed after the initial penthouse collapses.
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:22.085]  And then we have squibs that are very visible, even in Building 7.
[01:11:22.806 --> 01:11:29.995]  You can see them on our website, ae911truth.org, which stands for Architects and Engineers.
[01:11:31.807 --> 01:11:33.709]  AE911Truth.org.
[01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:38.572]  By the way, somebody spray-painted that on a huge 18-wheeler off the side of a highway.
[01:11:39.093 --> 01:11:42.255]  I've got photos up on PrisonPlanet.com of that, so the word's getting out.
[01:11:42.675 --> 01:11:44.317]  And somebody had an InfoWars.com.
[01:11:44.337 --> 01:11:46.378]  I just wanted to add this before we run out of time.
[01:11:47.059 --> 01:11:52.263]  A big old banner at the Live Earth concert that went out to all those tens of millions of people.
[01:11:52.283 --> 01:11:52.663]  Go ahead.
[01:11:53.163 --> 01:11:54.244]  Oh, yeah.
[01:11:54.344 --> 01:12:00.429]  Well, you can see the squibs in the upper right corner of the flash video on our website.
[01:12:00.788 --> 01:12:03.009]  And these are timed floor by floor.
[01:12:03.089 --> 01:12:04.389]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:07.150]  Very visible explosions.
[01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:18.334]  So we start with Building 7 with the architects because they can very readily see and have a frame of reference with which to judge that it is indeed a controlled demolition because we've all seen them on TV.
[01:12:19.314 --> 01:12:24.516]  We have a collapse into its own footprint and the steel skeleton is broken up for shipment.
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:31.923]  We have massive volumes of expanding pyroclastic dust clouds which flow out from this building.
[01:12:32.023 --> 01:12:43.087]  That's really one of the main keys is that you have just thousands of tons of glass and concrete and rubber and sheetrock and stone and metal.
[01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:47.391]  We've seen many collapses and they don't look like this at all.
[01:12:47.711 --> 01:12:50.254]  Furthermore, we have Dr. Stephen Jones who has found
[01:13:05.309 --> 01:13:13.058]  At the basement of the World Trade Center, the firemen, and FEMA even, documents beams partially evaporated.
[01:13:13.498 --> 01:13:19.505]  Sulfur and sulfidated ends of these beams virtually melted.
[01:13:19.545 --> 01:13:22.148]  The firemen were just completely aghast.
[01:13:22.528 --> 01:13:24.851]  The New York Times called it the biggest mystery of all.
[01:13:25.253 --> 01:13:38.851]  Well, Dr. Jones was sent some of this slag from a memorial at Clarkston University, and he analyzes it and he finds chemical evidence of thermate, which is a high-sulfur form of thermite.
[01:13:39.586 --> 01:13:44.588]  Uh, uh, which, which, uh, is used by the military to cut through steel like a knife through butter.
[01:13:45.068 --> 01:13:48.689]  These are very specific chemical properties in specific proportions.
[01:13:49.050 --> 01:14:03.955]  And then from repeated chain of custody documented samples from multiple people now looked at by different physicists and laboratories and, and experts, uh, we know that it was the Thermate, an exact type used in controlled demolition.
[01:14:04.455 --> 01:14:08.457]  And then please continue with the smoking gun caught red-handed information.
[01:14:09.658 --> 01:14:14.363]  Yeah, because the by-product of this thermate is molten iron.
[01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:22.212]  And even the World Trade Center structural engineer, Leslie Robertson, finds this stuff flowing.
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:44.217]  Still after 21 days, and the firemen we have on video saying it's flowing like lava under all three buildings, and we're going to get to the Twin Towers next, but that's corroborated by FEMA themselves who say that there was intergranular melting and rapid oxidation on the steel, and fire does not melt steel.
[01:14:44.317 --> 01:14:46.539]  A fire gets to be about 1200 to 1400 degrees, a very hot office fire,
[01:14:49.831 --> 01:14:53.476]  1,800 degrees maximum under ideal fuel-air mixture ratios.
[01:14:53.816 --> 01:14:58.721]  What we have to melt steel is 2,700 degrees where it begins to melt.
[01:14:59.242 --> 01:15:02.225]  So where did all this molten metal come from?
[01:15:02.345 --> 01:15:08.953]  NIST completely denies the video evidence and the direct evidence of the World Trade Center structural engineer.
[01:15:09.508 --> 01:15:11.609]  That there was any molten metal.
[01:15:11.649 --> 01:15:11.969]  Why?
[01:15:12.069 --> 01:15:15.531]  Because they have no means of explaining it.
[01:15:15.891 --> 01:15:20.974]  The kinetic energy for an... And not just molten metal that day, three, four, five weeks later.
[01:15:21.654 --> 01:15:25.236]  Oh yeah, this stuff lasted for I think a couple of months actually.
[01:15:25.256 --> 01:15:35.241]  So we have stuff lasting upwards of two months, eight weeks, at temperatures well above anything that normal fires could even burn at.
[01:15:35.874 --> 01:15:36.895]  Oh yeah.
[01:15:37.055 --> 01:15:37.855]  It's extraordinary.
[01:15:37.875 --> 01:15:46.339]  Now folks, I know we hammer this home all the time, but the point is you've got a big group with hundreds of engineers and architects looking at this and doing major tests.
[01:15:46.739 --> 01:15:49.561]  And plus we had underwriting laboratories doing internal tests before.
[01:15:49.581 --> 01:15:52.062]  They tried to keep secret saying it couldn't happen either.
[01:15:52.362 --> 01:15:54.343]  I mean, we have the folks who underwrote the buildings saying it.
[01:15:54.543 --> 01:15:55.724]  We have them red-handed.
[01:15:56.384 --> 01:15:57.725]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:58.065 --> 01:16:00.186]  In fact, the fire
[01:16:01.401 --> 01:16:11.007]  The fires that were in Building 7, because it did sustain some damage from the collapse of Building 1, were not large.
[01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.808]  There was a lot of smoke on the backside.
[01:16:13.188 --> 01:16:17.391]  But when fires bring buildings down, and by the way, they have never brought down
[01:16:18.024 --> 01:16:20.445]  A steel-framed, high-rise building.
[01:16:20.706 --> 01:16:23.867]  We have hundreds of examples of that.
[01:16:24.328 --> 01:16:26.089]  For instance, Caracas, Venezuela, 2004.
[01:16:26.129 --> 01:16:27.870]  We fire-burned 17 hours over 26 floors.
[01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:29.350]  Los Angeles, we have 3 1⁄2 hours over 5 floors.
[01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:29.631]  Madrid, 2005.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:38.480]  What?
[01:16:38.941 --> 01:16:39.601]  Madrid.
[01:16:39.681 --> 01:16:40.322]  Yeah, Madrid.
[01:16:40.682 --> 01:16:45.707]  And by the way, Madrid, the Windsor building was a concrete reinforced core building.
[01:16:46.027 --> 01:16:48.109]  So I don't know that it's a great example.
[01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:51.492]  But all these other ones are steel buildings.
[01:16:51.532 --> 01:16:54.695]  The Meridian Plaza burned for 18 hours over eight floors.
[01:16:55.095 --> 01:16:56.536]  All these buildings are in use today.
[01:16:57.117 --> 01:16:58.458]  They do not collapse.
[01:16:58.538 --> 01:17:01.421]  And by the way, the fireproofing is only good for two or three hours.
[01:17:01.829 --> 01:17:09.073]  These were very hot, very hot, very large, very long-lasting fires that exceeded the capability of the fireproofing.
[01:17:09.493 --> 01:17:17.818]  Now, we turn to Building 7, and you have a few small fires, and you have a complete collapse of the building.
[01:17:18.419 --> 01:17:32.843]  When fires bring buildings down they fall with large visible deformations and they have an asymmetrical collapse always because fire attacks one side of the building not all the columns at once uniformly all around the building.
[01:17:32.903 --> 01:17:40.765]  Only a controlled demolition can do that and that's exactly what we see in the results of a symmetrical straight down free fall speed collapse.
[01:17:41.065 --> 01:17:42.785]  It's really quite extraordinary.
[01:17:43.385 --> 01:17:46.746]  So when we turn to building, to the Twin Towers for instance,
[01:17:47.341 --> 01:17:52.783]  We have the same set of control demolition features with some very key differences.
[01:17:53.264 --> 01:18:03.848]  If you wanted to blame the collapse of a building on these airplanes that struck, of course you'd start the explosions at the point of the airplane.
[01:18:03.888 --> 01:18:09.711]  So we have a top-down control demolition never seen before in history, really.
[01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:16.674]  And furthermore, all of the debris is blown outside the footprint.
[01:18:17.399 --> 01:18:23.343]  Uh, and such that we don't have a pile of pancakes, according to the official theory.
[01:18:23.823 --> 01:18:29.546]  We have this pile driver pushing down the Twin Towers, crushing everything underneath it.
[01:18:29.586 --> 01:18:36.871]  But first of all, the pile driver itself is blown apart and outside the footprint, hurling 20-ton beams 500 feet.
[01:18:36.911 --> 01:18:44.155]  Yeah, bottom line, there isn't the pancake weight to do it, because the beams and everything are being ejected, in some cases, hundreds of yards.
[01:18:44.995 --> 01:18:46.520]  So, where is the weight?
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.085]  Where is the hammer to hit the anvil?
[01:18:48.466 --> 01:18:49.228]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:49.288 --> 01:18:49.790]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.053 --> 01:19:02.318]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:02.578 --> 01:19:06.920]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:16.145]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:16.345 --> 01:19:19.987]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:19:20.267 --> 01:19:22.809]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons
[01:19:23.729 --> 01:19:25.270]  Or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:32.314]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:19:32.794 --> 01:19:33.454]  What about you?

[01:20:02.809 --> 01:20:04.691]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels switching dollar to yen.
[01:20:04.711 --> 01:20:05.591]  Bad news for US currency.
[01:20:05.631 --> 01:20:07.152]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[01:20:22.623 --> 01:20:24.044]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[01:20:24.304 --> 01:20:26.365]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro.
[01:20:26.525 --> 01:20:27.585]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:20:27.765 --> 01:20:30.327]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of the U.S.
[01:20:30.487 --> 01:20:32.387]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[01:20:32.568 --> 01:20:35.069]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.

[01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:05.214]  Richard Gage, Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[01:23:06.035 --> 01:23:11.359]  The website needs to be spread far and wide, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:11.379 --> 01:23:16.282]  We have a link to it up on Infowars.com.
[01:23:17.723 --> 01:23:20.045]  Going back to our guest, Richard Gage.
[01:23:21.806 --> 01:23:24.148]  Richard, continuing with the points.
[01:23:25.126 --> 01:23:34.274]  Yes, well, when we get to the Twin Towers, we discussed that we have this rapid onset of destruction at the point of the airplane impacts.
[01:23:34.334 --> 01:23:48.287]  Now, this is witnessed by no less and recorded on tape by no less than 118 firefighters and emergency workers, which were recorded by the City Fire Commissioner, Thomas Van Essen.
[01:23:48.783 --> 01:23:54.147]  And finally released due to a court order from the New York State Court of Appeals.
[01:23:54.187 --> 01:23:55.788]  The city was trying to hide this stuff.
[01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:57.190]  And now we know why.
[01:23:57.230 --> 01:24:04.875]  It came out in August of 2005 and 118 of them are talking about explosions and then the building coming down.
[01:24:05.316 --> 01:24:06.357]  Flashes of light.
[01:24:09.719 --> 01:24:14.263]  Explosions like a belt all the way around the Twin Towers.
[01:24:14.463 --> 01:24:15.924]  They go on and on and on.
[01:24:16.773 --> 01:24:22.498]  A number of brief light sources being emitted from inside the building between floors... Let me stop you right there, Richard.
[01:24:22.518 --> 01:24:27.442]  Let me stop you and expand on this, just the psychology of it.
[01:24:28.082 --> 01:24:36.749]  Why do you think the military-industrial complex... I know you're a scientist, you're an engineer, you're an architect, so you're not gonna... but I mean, you're stepping outside of that hat for a minute.
[01:24:37.686 --> 01:24:37.846]  I think?
[01:25:08.026 --> 01:25:15.768]  I mean, was it just like, hey, we killed the President in front of everybody, and hundreds of people saw the shooters, and we just told them, no, you didn't see that, and killed them?
[01:25:16.849 --> 01:25:26.191]  I mean, why do they think they can just blow this up in front of everybody, including the police and firemen, and then just tell us that it happened because of jet fuel?
[01:25:27.092 --> 01:25:30.473]  When four or five corporations own 90% of the media,
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.481]  You can pretty much pull the wool over and tell any story you want.
[01:25:35.761 --> 01:25:46.605]  And if we are not given an opportunity on that mainstream media to present the truth, then you pretty much have control of the people.
[01:25:46.645 --> 01:25:52.127]  But they're not going to get away with it because our 120 architects and engineers, within one year, is going to reach 1,000.
[01:25:52.788 --> 01:25:54.148]  And we're demanding.
[01:25:54.408 --> 01:25:55.789]  And anybody can join AE911Truth.org.
[01:25:57.228 --> 01:26:08.216]  And join us in raising an incredible cry from the scientific, architectural, and building professional community for a new investigation of Congress with subpoena power.
[01:26:08.726 --> 01:26:15.769]  And we can actually have an incredible... Well, look, anybody with a brain in Washington knows it's an inside job.
[01:26:16.109 --> 01:26:17.749]  And this is all part of the climate of fear.
[01:26:17.849 --> 01:26:20.350]  I mean, they are announcing they may go to martial law.
[01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:22.851]  They are announcing that we're in a police state.
[01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.032]  Congress is being blackmailed.
[01:26:25.332 --> 01:26:26.753]  I mean, let's make no mistake, folks.
[01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:30.514]  We are in the deep stages of hardcore tyranny.
[01:26:31.278 --> 01:26:32.219]  Yes, it's true.
[01:26:32.319 --> 01:26:34.941]  You started your statement with what's in my mind and heart.
[01:26:47.628 --> 01:26:52.353]  And what's most important to me in my analysis, we're not safe, folks!
[01:26:52.493 --> 01:26:57.198]  We got people running the government that'll kill 3,000 citizens just like that.
[01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:59.560]  Now, we've always had governments that would do stuff like that.
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:00.801]  That's just history.
[01:27:00.881 --> 01:27:08.088]  But that they do it so bold, you know, with just such an ostentatious way.
[01:27:08.826 --> 01:27:16.771]  With this big theatrical event, shows that if you think that was big, they'll do stuff a hundred times bigger, and the CFR's talking about things even bigger happening.
[01:27:17.011 --> 01:27:19.213]  So, I mean, this is life and death, folks.
[01:27:19.453 --> 01:27:21.534]  We're in danger with these people in control.
[01:27:21.814 --> 01:27:22.915]  They've got to be exposed.
[01:27:22.935 --> 01:27:23.255]  Go ahead.
[01:27:24.096 --> 01:27:24.716]  They really do.
[01:27:25.096 --> 01:27:33.862]  And one of the ways they do it is by the public knowledge that there are 700 bone fragments less than a centimeter long found on top of the Deutsche Bank building.
[01:27:34.302 --> 01:27:34.563]  I think?
[01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:53.653]  Into this fine powder that's, uh, 10 to 100 microns.
[01:27:53.673 --> 01:27:55.374]  We're talking the width of a human hair.
[01:27:55.514 --> 01:27:56.475]  Now, again, let's explain.
[01:27:56.535 --> 01:28:00.538]  We have supposed pancake, but the steel beams are flying out hundreds of feet.
[01:28:00.898 --> 01:28:02.179]  Everything's being aerosolized.
[01:28:02.539 --> 01:28:07.823]  And literally, hundreds of yards away, pieces of bone are blasted across the street.
[01:28:08.103 --> 01:28:09.224]  I mean, folks, come on!
[01:28:09.724 --> 01:28:12.726]  And guess what's at the bottom of this building?
[01:28:13.107 --> 01:28:14.728]  Are there any pancaking floors?
[01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:17.630]  We're talking four-inch thick concrete floors.
[01:28:18.150 --> 01:28:25.516]  That are an acre in size and there's 110 of them and they're supported on 20-gauge steel decking over floor trusses.
[01:28:25.936 --> 01:28:29.439]  And every, every, there isn't one of them left at the bottom.
[01:28:29.459 --> 01:28:34.563]  Okay, maybe a few of them disintegrated in the kinetic energy, but there's none of them.
[01:28:34.583 --> 01:28:35.985]  There's a hole, basically.
[01:28:36.185 --> 01:28:36.945]  Absolutely.
[01:28:37.306 --> 01:28:40.508]  They were blown to kingdom come with massive high-powered explosives.
[01:28:40.929 --> 01:28:42.750]  Stay there, Richard Gage.
[01:28:44.471 --> 01:28:45.432]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.452 --> 01:28:47.374]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.363 --> 01:28:51.124]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.744 --> 01:28:55.164]  Attention!
[01:28:55.284 --> 01:28:58.085]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:28:58.385 --> 01:29:02.686]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:29:03.006 --> 01:29:03.686]  Listen closely.
[01:29:04.326 --> 01:29:11.788]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on earth.
[01:29:12.108 --> 01:29:20.858]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:29:21.178 --> 01:29:26.664]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:29:27.125 --> 01:29:36.428]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:29:36.628 --> 01:29:42.250]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:46.032]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:29:46.252 --> 01:29:49.593]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:55.319 --> 01:29:56.560]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[01:29:57.121 --> 01:29:57.781]  News alert!
[01:29:58.281 --> 01:30:02.505]  Twice a month you can now get the Divided Kingdom's brand new newsletter.
[01:30:02.945 --> 01:30:03.505]  Concise?
[01:30:03.806 --> 01:30:04.426]  Hard-hitting?
[01:30:04.786 --> 01:30:07.729]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.270]  War in Iran?
[01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:11.432]  A coming One World Church?
[01:30:12.192 --> 01:30:17.496]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.
[01:30:18.016 --> 01:30:25.440]  For a free sample copy of the Divided Kingdom dossier, write to Post Office Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.

[01:30:49.576 --> 01:30:50.877]  Box 8, Bethlehem, MD 21609.
[01:30:54.088 --> 01:30:56.589]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:56.649 --> 01:31:03.470]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:07.551]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[01:31:08.211 --> 01:31:09.772]  Would the Marines accept this?
[01:31:09.852 --> 01:31:20.414]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[01:31:21.094 --> 01:31:22.515]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:31:22.655 --> 01:31:24.396]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[01:31:24.976 --> 01:31:32.561]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:31:33.281 --> 01:31:34.722]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:31:40.605 --> 01:31:42.867]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:31:43.488 --> 01:31:46.810]  Call now.
[01:31:47.011 --> 01:31:53.436]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:31:53.456 --> 01:31:57.139]  I hurt myself
[01:32:09.844 --> 01:32:17.445]  Today, to see if I still feel.
[01:32:17.845 --> 01:32:28.167]  I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
[01:32:28.507 --> 01:32:36.909]  The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting.
[01:32:38.684 --> 01:32:47.414]  Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything.
[01:32:48.115 --> 01:32:49.156]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:32:50.117 --> 01:32:52.801]  What have I become?
[01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:56.365]  The globalist.
[01:32:56.525 --> 01:32:58.127]  The New World Order.
[01:33:00.807 --> 01:33:08.550]  I realize that many people just can't face the horror.
[01:33:08.610 --> 01:33:12.451]  Just like many Germans, Americans didn't believe it, didn't know what Hitler was doing.
[01:33:13.571 --> 01:33:20.894]  But I actually read a lot of history books on it, interviewed some of the people that were young at the time, who were teenagers or younger in Germany, and they really didn't know.
[01:33:21.934 --> 01:33:24.715]  People right down the street from concentration camps didn't know.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:36.967]  And it's just like today where people step over a woman who's been stabbed three times in the main entrance aisle of a major grocery store in Kansas.
[01:33:37.027 --> 01:33:38.888]  And she bleeds to death and people take photos of her.
[01:33:40.309 --> 01:33:42.111]  We're worse than the Germans in many respects.
[01:33:42.131 --> 01:33:45.733]  We're totally disconnected from reality now.
[01:33:46.154 --> 01:33:47.194]  The general public is.
[01:33:48.195 --> 01:33:53.759]  And so you're going to have a government that goes, let's blow the building up, kill a bunch of people, and launch our new world order.
[01:33:55.698 --> 01:33:57.540]  Or relaunch our stalling New World Order.
[01:33:58.721 --> 01:34:07.407]  And there have been a lot of people out there saying 9-11 Truth is stalled, 9-11 Truth can't, you know, will never get convictions, will never win.
[01:34:07.828 --> 01:34:09.669]  Frankly, I'm getting real sick of hearing that.
[01:34:10.450 --> 01:34:11.531]  We don't have a choice.
[01:34:11.611 --> 01:34:13.713]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[01:34:14.553 --> 01:34:22.820]  And even if we're not going to defeat the New World Order and physically convict Dick Cheney and the Rockefellers and the New World Order and the Military-Industrial Complex,
[01:34:24.497 --> 01:34:27.640]  We're going to expose false flag terrorism inside job.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:38.450]  We're going to bring it into the nomenclature, into the vernacular, and then take that tool of problem reaction solution, of state-sponsored terror, away from the new order.
[01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:40.292]  We're going to take that device.
[01:34:40.928 --> 01:34:46.573]  We're going to take that mechanism, and we are going to literally rip it to pieces in front of the New World Order.
[01:34:46.933 --> 01:34:49.996]  And we've done that now, and false flag terror is in the vernacular.
[01:34:50.336 --> 01:34:53.118]  And people are going, hey, even if terror is real, why should I give up my liberties?
[01:34:53.519 --> 01:34:56.781]  They did this to launch the war, which they mean to lead into Iran.
[01:34:56.981 --> 01:34:58.283]  They've lied to you about everything.
[01:34:59.023 --> 01:35:04.668]  Folks, they sterilized, they didn't just sterilize half a million people in this country, or close to half a million that we know of.
[01:35:04.948 --> 01:35:05.989]  They killed a lot of people.
[01:35:07.242 --> 01:35:07.843]  With eugenics.
[01:35:07.903 --> 01:35:09.083]  It started here, folks.
[01:35:09.564 --> 01:35:11.085]  See, most people don't even know what eugenics is.
[01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:14.828]  I mean, they killed more than 3,000 people in this country.
[01:35:14.868 --> 01:35:15.868]  I mean, they killed babies.
[01:35:16.088 --> 01:35:16.789]  They killed men.
[01:35:18.450 --> 01:35:19.111]  They killed women.
[01:35:19.531 --> 01:35:21.893]  So I don't want to hear, it can't happen, it won't happen.
[01:35:22.793 --> 01:35:26.836]  Our government, thousands of times, has sprayed deadly nerve gas on our cribs and killed them.
[01:35:27.337 --> 01:35:27.677]  Knowingly.
[01:35:28.497 --> 01:35:29.178]  Declassified.
[01:35:30.251 --> 01:35:31.372]  I don't want to hear it.
[01:35:31.733 --> 01:35:32.393]  They did it.
[01:35:32.734 --> 01:35:33.775]  It's not our government.
[01:35:33.995 --> 01:35:34.936]  It's a criminal elite.
[01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:39.340]  Now, when Hillary gets in or Obama gets in and Paul can't win, I think Paul can win.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:47.788]  I'm saying if Paul can't win in the future tense, if he's unable to win, which we hope he does, and he's doing better than we even thought, and I think he can win, with God's grace.
[01:35:48.969 --> 01:35:52.792]  But if he doesn't, you need to know, Hillary Clinton, they were involved in Oklahoma City.
[01:35:52.852 --> 01:35:54.034]  They vacationed with the Bushes.
[01:35:54.054 --> 01:35:55.395]  At that level, it's all staged.
[01:35:56.112 --> 01:35:59.153]  This is a Georgetown political science document show.
[01:35:59.593 --> 01:36:00.773]  It's been staged a long time.
[01:36:02.954 --> 01:36:04.154]  They're going to continue with the terror.
[01:36:04.334 --> 01:36:07.055]  And 9-11 Truth isn't going to die when they get in power.
[01:36:07.355 --> 01:36:09.876]  We have to make it non-partisan and make it non-partisan now.
[01:36:10.396 --> 01:36:16.998]  And that's what Richard Gage and American Institute of Architects
[01:36:18.382 --> 01:36:24.843]  Remember, the American Institute of Architects, representing architects and engineers for 9-11 at AE911.org is doing.
[01:36:25.044 --> 01:36:26.124]  And I'm going to get him up.
[01:36:26.144 --> 01:36:26.824]  He's really great.
[01:36:27.484 --> 01:36:29.124]  And we've got Corsi coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:36:29.144 --> 01:36:31.325]  I'm going to get him up for a full two hours next week.
[01:36:31.745 --> 01:36:34.566]  I'm going to have my producer call you right now, sir, if he can do that.
[01:36:34.586 --> 01:36:35.646]  We'll get you up for two hours.
[01:36:36.966 --> 01:36:42.708]  But I want you to go through all of your 18 points and really have time to spend a lot of time on each one and then take calls.
[01:36:43.288 --> 01:36:44.348]  But just in closing,
[01:36:46.768 --> 01:36:51.050]  Talk about your mission, what you guys and gals are doing, and where you're going from here.
[01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:54.011]  And then can you speak to what I was saying about, we don't have a choice.
[01:36:55.392 --> 01:37:03.975]  Because not just that it's a mass murder of citizens by the globalists, but that this is a major declaration that they are getting a lot more bold, folks.
[01:37:04.015 --> 01:37:06.596]  This means, as you said, we're all in grave danger.
[01:37:08.477 --> 01:37:13.119]  Yeah, well, Alex, I'll let you speak to that one, because
[01:37:14.202 --> 01:37:18.224]  It's hard enough just to stay with the physical evidence here.
[01:37:18.244 --> 01:37:21.246]  There's so much of it, and it's so much work.
[01:37:22.427 --> 01:37:27.530]  I haven't looked at what else the globalists are doing, so I'll leave that one to you.
[01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:28.470]  But in terms of AE911Truth.org,
[01:37:30.558 --> 01:37:42.386]  Our mission is to bring this truth to every architect and engineer in the Bay Area here in San Francisco and then throughout the United States and we seem to be doing that.
[01:37:42.566 --> 01:37:54.814]  I'll be in New York speaking on September 8th and with Kevin Ryan and Stephen Jones in Indiana on September 10th and back here in Oakland at the Grand Lake Theater on September 11th in the evening.
[01:37:55.478 --> 01:37:58.561]  So, well, we have a full flight, and I won't rest.
[01:37:59.042 --> 01:38:03.106]  We have members who donate on AE911Truth.org.
[01:38:03.406 --> 01:38:12.535]  I mean, anybody can donate, and we appreciate it, because what we ask you to do is buy an architect lunch, and we'll feed him the 9-11 truth.
[01:38:13.903 --> 01:38:16.344]  And we're about that right now.
[01:38:16.404 --> 01:38:20.125]  We're going to be taking this presentation to architects' offices.
[01:38:20.545 --> 01:38:26.047]  In fact, today we're at the East Bay Chapter of the American Institute of Architects giving a presentation there.
[01:38:27.368 --> 01:38:29.328]  So it's exciting.
[01:38:29.449 --> 01:38:31.409]  Oh, I hope you're videotaping that.
[01:38:31.429 --> 01:38:32.790]  You've got to get that out on YouTube.
[01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:34.050]  Oh yeah.
[01:38:34.590 --> 01:38:41.933]  In fact, people can watch our two-hour presentation right on our website on the left side there.
[01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:42.863]  I don't
[01:38:58.898 --> 01:39:00.880]  We're good to go.
[01:39:18.116 --> 01:39:37.479]  All of it, the firefighters, the police on record saying, as you said, rings, jackets of explosions, flashes, pieces of bone blasted 100 plus yard on top of buildings, aerosolized, all of this, the molten steel at 500 plus degrees above what fires can even burn at without accelerants.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.361]  Yeah, well, I'm being conservative.
[01:39:40.381 --> 01:39:41.401]  Yeah, a thousand degrees above.
[01:39:41.421 --> 01:39:50.866]  Just the laws of physics, it's absolutely incredible, and I'm going to have my producer call you right now, sir, and we will get you back up next week.
[01:39:50.886 --> 01:39:51.367]  God bless.
[01:39:51.807 --> 01:39:52.767]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:39:53.188 --> 01:39:53.968]  You bet.
[01:39:54.368 --> 01:40:04.033]  Now, shifting gears, again, we're going to stay on 9-11, and I'm going to intensify my effort on 9-11, because I've heard some people in our own movement saying, well, the movement's growing, but not fast enough.
[01:40:05.723 --> 01:40:09.066]  And, you know, Bush is going to leave office, and Hillary is going to get in, and it's going to stall.
[01:40:09.406 --> 01:40:10.407]  We're never going to stop!
[01:40:11.528 --> 01:40:18.313]  And when they blow something else up, or they carry out another terror attack, like they did in Oklahoma City, believe me, when Hillary gets in, they're going to probably nuke a major city.
[01:40:19.074 --> 01:40:19.834]  That's their M.O.
[01:40:20.194 --> 01:40:26.539]  And they'll blame it on their own creation, the Muslims, which certainly is a real terror threat, and they're financing that as well.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:29.682]  And I'm just not going to put up with it, while they leave the borders wide open.
[01:40:29.962 --> 01:40:34.646]  Alright, shifting gears, and I appreciate him coming on with us for a quick report, is Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:40:36.193 --> 01:40:52.151]  And we're here today talking about an article he did about a month ago for WorldNetDaily, also Human Events, he writes for both, about the different globalist groups, the CFR, that literally wrote the plan that was adopted by FIAT, the Security and Prosperity Partnership that is the North American Union.
[01:40:52.812 --> 01:40:55.315]  Just like they said Amnesty wasn't Amnesty, they tried that.
[01:40:56.464 --> 01:41:04.652]  Now, they're going to try to introduce this in the fall, and I also wanted to talk to him about an LA Times article, Mexican Cartels Outgun Towns Police.
[01:41:05.393 --> 01:41:07.374]  But, Dr. Corsi, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:41:07.815 --> 01:41:08.135]  Hi, Alex.
[01:41:08.215 --> 01:41:09.656]  It's always a pleasure to be with you.
[01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:10.177]  Thank you.
[01:41:10.817 --> 01:41:12.018]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:22.368]  Dr. Corsi, just in the time we've got, break down what we're facing in the whole North American Union agenda, what the game plan is right now.
[01:41:22.859 --> 01:41:26.982]  And Alex, you know, my new book is just out on this, The Late Great U.S.A.
[01:41:27.563 --> 01:41:28.404]  It just got published.
[01:41:28.444 --> 01:41:29.725]  It's in the stores this week.
[01:41:30.385 --> 01:41:32.807]  It's on the coming merger with Mexico and Canada.
[01:41:32.847 --> 01:41:34.549]  I put together a book on the subject.
[01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:43.856]  And it's starting with the Security and Prosperity Partnership in North America, which was declared on March 23rd, 2005 at a summit meeting.
[01:41:44.637 --> 01:41:52.403]  No law, no treaty, just President Bush coming out with Vincenti Fox of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada then, Paul Martin,
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.283]  Declaring we're in the Security and Prosperity Partnership in North America.
[01:41:56.863 --> 01:42:03.288]  Well, the agenda to integrate Mexico and Canada has accelerated ever since that press conference.
[01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:20.162]  And I write in the book and I'm arguing extensively that we're on the same stealth track that Europe went on over 50 years, going 50 years ago in 1957 from a Coal and Steel Agreement, advancing incrementally, step-by-step,
[01:42:20.856 --> 01:42:27.991]  With the elite that were pushing the agenda, the multinational corporations, to evolve into a common market.
[01:42:28.686 --> 01:42:37.971]  And then a European community follows by... And let's be clear, because all these liberals say, well that's the next phase is going to global... Okay, let's not argue whether global government is good or bad.
[01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:39.852]  Obviously anything too centralized is bad.
[01:42:39.872 --> 01:42:45.294]  I like the analogy of national sovereignty being like firewalls in a building or bulkheads in a ship.
[01:42:45.354 --> 01:42:50.697]  If one country gets overrun like Germany or Russia or China, the next country is harder to get overrun.
[01:42:51.197 --> 01:42:52.018]  But that aside,
[01:42:52.498 --> 01:42:54.860]  Let's just say it's neutral, whether it's good or bad.
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:59.662]  The point is, what they're setting up across the board is a racing due process.
[01:43:00.383 --> 01:43:01.944]  You're guilty until proven innocent.
[01:43:02.404 --> 01:43:03.925]  It's whole new taxation grids.
[01:43:04.005 --> 01:43:04.685]  It's hell on earth.
[01:43:04.705 --> 01:43:05.806]  Go ahead.
[01:43:06.186 --> 01:43:14.151]  Also, I think there's a strong argument to be made, Alex, that our sovereignty is critical to preserve, protect, and defend.
[01:43:14.931 --> 01:43:20.295]  Our rights under the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights are
[01:43:21.485 --> 01:43:27.107]  We're inalienable, granted by God, not by a North American Union or the United Nations or anybody else.
[01:43:27.967 --> 01:43:30.748]  Our human definitions of rights can be altered and taken away.
[01:43:30.768 --> 01:43:37.390]  And our institutions of government, as defined in the Constitution, our founders believed, derived from natural right.
[01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:46.634]  They were institutions that were necessary to put into place a constitutional, limited republic, with checks and balances between the branches of government.
[01:43:47.114 --> 01:43:50.875]  That structure was necessary to put into place in order to preserve our freedoms.
[01:43:51.584 --> 01:43:55.066]  So if we just say, well, you know, it's unimportant whether U.S.
[01:43:55.106 --> 01:43:56.507]  sovereignty is preserved.
[01:43:57.047 --> 01:44:09.795]  I think there's a lot of people buried today in Arlington, Virginia, in the cemetery who would say they died, fought and died for the United States of America, not for North American Union or any other regional or global government.
[01:44:11.476 --> 01:44:15.619]  Now, you put out a report about a month ago, but that's how stories are, sometimes they get traction later.
[01:44:16.698 --> 01:44:20.243]  Uh, we pointed it out again a few weeks ago and it seemed to start spreading from there.
[01:44:21.044 --> 01:44:28.414]  Uh, dealing with how the CFR writes up these plans and then they're adopted wholesale on a hundred plus famous issues in this nation.
[01:44:28.735 --> 01:44:29.897]  So we've got to take this serious.
[01:44:29.937 --> 01:44:32.701]  What about stealth implementation or this, I mean...
[01:44:33.431 --> 01:44:36.272]  Well, we knew a year ago they were going to introduce carbon tax in the Congress.
[01:44:36.332 --> 01:44:37.172]  It's been done today.
[01:44:37.192 --> 01:44:41.794]  It seems like they're making their move on a hundred fronts right now.
[01:44:42.494 --> 01:44:47.556]  What can we see in the fall with them trying to introduce a North American Union under some other name?
[01:44:48.036 --> 01:44:59.240]  Well, right now, I mean, it was surprising to me to see that the Security and Prosperity Partnership in North America was actually mentioned explicitly in a whole section of this Kennedy-McCain
[01:44:59.853 --> 01:45:04.075]  Chamnesty Bill, which George Bush twice just recently tried to shove through the Senate.
[01:45:05.155 --> 01:45:08.917]  And that was a very explicit presentation of the SPP.
[01:45:09.737 --> 01:45:21.882]  And there's a coming up, the Law of Energy is focusing right now on the next summit meeting, and the Security and Prosperity Partnership, which is going to be in Quebec, in Montebello, Quebec, in Canada in August.
[01:45:22.682 --> 01:45:27.383]  And the Canadian protest groups are mobilizing to strongly resist SPP.
[01:45:27.863 --> 01:45:35.425]  It'll be a meeting with George Bush together with Calderon of Mexico and Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada.
[01:45:36.025 --> 01:45:41.506]  A meeting at this hotel for a few days, setting up the next agenda for the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:45:42.346 --> 01:45:47.787]  And while Bush has suffered a setback in not getting his amnesty bill through Congress,
[01:45:48.547 --> 01:45:51.349]  You know, that was, in fact, the next plan.
[01:45:51.689 --> 01:45:54.291]  Well, Kennedy said, we'll be back within two months.
[01:45:54.591 --> 01:45:55.712]  Oh, yeah, they'll be back, though.
[01:45:56.012 --> 01:46:00.235]  What they're planning to do is to, you know, use kind of a salami approach, or a sausage approach.
[01:46:00.255 --> 01:46:02.036]  They're going to cut it up into pieces.
[01:46:02.877 --> 01:46:04.298]  They said that.
[01:46:04.338 --> 01:46:04.878]  They said that.
[01:46:04.918 --> 01:46:06.719]  They said, we're going to pass this piecemeal.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:11.443]  They'll pass the piecemeal, so you're going to see a piece of it here and this piece of legislation.
[01:46:11.483 --> 01:46:14.865]  They may try to slip some in appropriations legislation.
[01:46:14.885 --> 01:46:17.627]  And then they just kind of tinker-toy it and Lego it together later.
[01:46:18.146 --> 01:46:27.453]  Right, and no one should think that we achieved a great victory by, a permanent victory, by defeating this bill that was trying to be jammed through the Senate.
[01:46:27.473 --> 01:46:27.834]  No, I agree.
[01:46:27.854 --> 01:46:31.396]  We're basically overwhelmed, outnumbered, in our trenches.
[01:46:31.436 --> 01:46:35.019]  We fought off a huge assault, and they're getting ready to come at our trenches again.
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:35.920]  Well, that's right.
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:46.208]  You know, that's the whole point of why I wrote the book, Alex, is to point out that this is a long-term battle, and the underlying agenda is not to pass a piece of immigration legislation.
[01:46:46.829 --> 01:46:47.209]  It's to
[01:46:47.850 --> 01:46:52.711]  Pushed the three countries increasingly towards economic and then political integration.
[01:46:52.751 --> 01:47:00.992]  Well, that's what people don't get is that it's really an ID card for the American people to have jobs and then they selectively enforce and don't enforce on the illegal aliens.
[01:47:01.412 --> 01:47:04.473]  And so it was really a North American Union ID card and that was in the documents.
[01:47:05.153 --> 01:47:10.554]  And, you know, you've got increasing work of the SPP working groups going on.
[01:47:11.334 --> 01:47:15.975]  People don't know, on April 27th, in Tucson, Arizona, Mary Peters held
[01:47:16.519 --> 01:47:20.680]  The first North American transportation trilateral meeting.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:29.441]  And they announced in Tucson that SPP working groups have now built five wide area augmentation stations for Mexico and Canada.
[01:47:29.921 --> 01:47:39.323]  Those are the stations you need to read the GPS, the Global Positioning Satellite data, for our entire air transport system.
[01:47:39.343 --> 01:47:41.563]  Yeah, they're already integrating the key systems.
[01:47:42.163 --> 01:47:45.844]  Our air traffic control system is now being given to Mexico and to Canada.
[01:47:46.553 --> 01:47:50.258]  Putting the ability to tell where our military aircraft are over the United States.
[01:47:50.398 --> 01:47:57.647]  And at that meeting they announced that the Canadian and Mexican air carriers are going to begin operating out of domestic U.S.
[01:47:57.687 --> 01:47:58.148]  terminals.
[01:47:58.729 --> 01:47:59.730]  As if they were a U.S.
[01:47:59.870 --> 01:48:00.350]  airline.
[01:48:00.571 --> 01:48:06.735]  Just like they are giving the Kansas City terminal as an internal port, and Mexico runs it.
[01:48:06.795 --> 01:48:08.657]  Folks, it's all happening.
[01:48:09.097 --> 01:48:15.662]  Now, coming up this fall, by stealth, Dr. Corsi, we're talking about the late, great U.S.A., the new book just out this week.
[01:48:16.663 --> 01:48:18.084]  I mean, how do we stop this?
[01:48:18.644 --> 01:48:19.725]  How are they going to package it?
[01:48:20.166 --> 01:48:25.750]  They're going to try to slip different pieces of it into legislation and different bills, and Alex, we're going to have to
[01:48:26.385 --> 01:48:29.326]  Remain vigilant, report on each time they attempt this.
[01:48:29.926 --> 01:48:32.407]  The SPP working groups are continuing every day.
[01:48:32.427 --> 01:48:39.230]  They're meeting, they're continuing to advance the North American agenda, integrating and harmonizing our laws with Mexico and Canada.
[01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:50.554]  Now there are 12 states that have passed resolutions saying no North American Union, no NAFTA superhighways to be built in their states, and to pull out of the SPP.
[01:48:51.174 --> 01:48:54.635]  And I think the movement to pull out of the SPP is a movement
[01:48:55.154 --> 01:48:58.575]  They can begin to generate some momentum at the grassroots level.
[01:48:59.175 --> 01:49:02.715]  We've got to continue... But you don't hear any Republicans but Ron Paul calling for that?
[01:49:03.295 --> 01:49:09.357]  Only Ron Paul, even Pancredo of Colorado, and even Duncan Hunter in California.
[01:49:09.377 --> 01:49:19.558]  They're for building a fence, but they're not fully aboard yet, understanding that the real agenda here, that the borders are open on purpose by George Bush.
[01:49:19.718 --> 01:49:22.419]  Yeah, SPP is the full integration, the fait accompli.
[01:49:23.150 --> 01:49:32.714]  And the promise made of Waco, Texas by George Bush was that the SPP working groups would increasingly open our borders with Mexico and Canada, and that's what's happening.
[01:49:33.594 --> 01:49:44.518]  Mexican trucks are going to begin to roll, and they will have SPP issues, Security and Prosperity Partnership issues, RFID identification chips, that will permit them to go into fast lane.
[01:49:44.558 --> 01:49:46.719]  Which is the model for every other automobile.
[01:49:46.739 --> 01:49:47.920]  We'll all be living under this.
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:50.240]  Stay there, Dr. Courtesy.
[01:49:50.601 --> 01:49:51.381]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:57.171 --> 01:50:02.639]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:10.651]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.337 --> 01:50:18.380]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:30.205]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.525 --> 01:50:34.027]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.487 --> 01:50:36.448]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.748 --> 01:50:40.590]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:53.894 --> 01:51:55.615]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.835 --> 01:51:59.537]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.857 --> 01:52:02.079]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:02.599 --> 01:52:08.803]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.943 --> 01:52:13.866]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:14.066 --> 01:52:23.011]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:53:21.559 --> 01:53:22.279]  But just go ahead and get it.
[01:53:22.299 --> 01:53:22.699]  I don't care.
[01:53:22.739 --> 01:53:23.480]  Just save the country.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:24.520]  That's what matters.
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:26.461]  Support people that are getting the truth out here.
[01:53:27.781 --> 01:53:30.502]  Our children literally have no future if we don't stop these people.
[01:53:30.542 --> 01:53:31.503]  This is not a joke.
[01:53:31.603 --> 01:53:32.703]  The country's on the line.
[01:53:32.723 --> 01:53:38.545]  You know, when I get up here, Dr. Corsi, and I explain that the country is dying right now, I mean it.
[01:53:38.685 --> 01:53:39.645]  I've seen the documents.
[01:53:39.705 --> 01:53:46.948]  I've spent many hours reading the entire four-year releases that Judicial Watch got from the September meeting last year in Banff, Canada.
[01:53:47.532 --> 01:53:57.526]  I mean, I cannot find words to express how massive and total this is, how we're going over to administrative law, and that power is being transferred to international private boards.
[01:53:58.187 --> 01:54:00.009]  This is nothing less than total treason.
[01:54:03.326 --> 01:54:11.713]  I just wish that the average person could grasp this, but the elites know the average person isn't stupid, but they're not focused on real issues, Dr. Corsi.
[01:54:11.994 --> 01:54:15.617]  How do you get people to focus on the country is ending right now?
[01:54:15.977 --> 01:54:31.410]  Well, Alex, I've put a whole chapter on that BAMF meeting, and the book, just like the articles I've been writing in WorldNetDaily and Human Events, the book has got the footnotes, it's got the documentation, so you can go to the original government sources and read it yourself.
[01:54:32.185 --> 01:54:56.817]  And that's critical when you're in a debate with the Congressmen and the Senators, because you can say, wait a minute, here's SPP.gov, and this is what the website says, and I publish from a FOIA request, Freedom of Information Act request, the government's own organizational chart of the shadow SPP bureaucracy, of the working groups, that the government doesn't publish that chart, but I've got it on page 81 of the book.
[01:54:57.477 --> 01:54:58.978]  So I'm giving people the data
[01:54:59.659 --> 01:55:08.492]  It is irrefutable from government websites that they can point to in arguing the case that this whole regionalization, integration of Canada and Mexico is happening.
[01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.889]  It certainly is.
[01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:14.952]  Now, again, getting back to that article you put out in late May, and I went and vetted it and checked it.
[01:55:15.432 --> 01:55:21.235]  I mean, I believe you because your information's always been accurate, but I always go try to dig up even more, and I found out, indeed, you're right.
[01:55:21.255 --> 01:55:29.139]  It looks like they're going to try to package it and push through the beginning of a North American Union openly sometime this fall.
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:37.744]  Any more intel on... I mean, we know they're going to introduce it, and they're bringing that plan to the Congress and the Chairman in the past they've implemented.
[01:55:38.084 --> 01:55:39.385]  Any idea how they're going to package it?
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.724]  No, I think right now they're seeing which pieces they can break up and implement in different pieces of legislation.
[01:55:47.285 --> 01:55:53.108]  I expect it's going to be divided into pieces and debated that way in Congress below the radar screen again.
[01:55:53.128 --> 01:55:54.970]  We're going to have to be very careful.
[01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:56.751]  You know, people celebrated.
[01:55:56.791 --> 01:56:02.194]  They said, oh, we beat back the Shamnesty bill and everybody took a deep breath and said we won.
[01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:04.116]  Well, nobody won anything.
[01:56:04.696 --> 01:56:07.858]  It was just simply a blocking of an attempt
[01:56:08.376 --> 01:56:15.901]  To get, in one package, this whole grandfathering legitimacy of the illegal aliens to stay.
[01:56:16.381 --> 01:56:21.444]  But it doesn't mean that the elitists pushing this agenda, the multinational corporations, are going to give up.
[01:56:22.125 --> 01:56:30.190]  At the same time, you see Chrysler announcing they're now going to manufacture cars in China, and transport them into the United States.
[01:56:30.690 --> 01:56:36.674]  Well, that puts more impetus on opening up these ports in Mexico, like Lazaro Cardenas in Manzanilla,
[01:56:37.538 --> 01:56:39.498]  And building the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:56:39.938 --> 01:56:50.840]  At the same time, Governor Perry vetoes all of the legislation passed by the Texas Legislature overwhelmingly to put a two-year moratorium on the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:51.901]  It was vetoed.
[01:56:52.281 --> 01:56:55.241]  He vetoed much of it while the Legislature was out of session.
[01:56:55.941 --> 01:56:59.222]  The Legislature doesn't come back in session in Texas for two years.
[01:56:59.302 --> 01:57:00.882]  And they're going to keep going ahead building it.
[01:57:00.962 --> 01:57:05.423]  They're going to build the highway and San Antonio, Kansas City,
[01:57:06.076 --> 01:57:09.057]  And Denver are all calling themselves inland ports.
[01:57:09.637 --> 01:57:10.617]  Where's the water?
[01:57:10.657 --> 01:57:12.858]  Well, the water's down in Lazaro Cardenas.
[01:57:13.458 --> 01:57:14.138]  It's the Mexican port.
[01:57:14.158 --> 01:57:15.118]  Now, let's be clear, folks.
[01:57:15.319 --> 01:57:16.719]  The legislature says no.
[01:57:17.319 --> 01:57:20.320]  Ninety-seven percent in major polls say no.
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:26.101]  And the governor, who's literally owned by the New World Order, goes to Bilderberg meetings, says, I don't care what you want.
[01:57:26.922 --> 01:57:27.542]  I'm going to do it.
[01:57:27.782 --> 01:57:29.662]  Dr. Corsi, stay there with us for five more minutes.
[01:57:29.682 --> 01:57:31.723]  I want to talk about the border situation.
[01:57:34.201 --> 01:57:39.306]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.131 --> 01:57:54.334]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.975 --> 01:57:55.795]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.556 --> 01:57:57.456]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.137 --> 01:58:01.759]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:06.403]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:17.319 --> 01:58:20.321]  His new book is out in stores nationwide this week.
[01:58:20.961 --> 01:58:22.162]  The Late Great USA.
[01:58:22.282 --> 01:58:23.943]  And folks, that's not hyperbole.
[01:58:25.984 --> 01:58:28.066]  Already the country's owned by foreign corporations.
[01:58:28.086 --> 01:58:30.847]  They've already run the comprehensive annual financial reports scam.
[01:58:31.908 --> 01:58:34.309]  And now they've militarized the police against us.
[01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:40.133]  And I have, what is it, five articles here today where illegal alien drunk drivers kill people and are released.
[01:58:41.194 --> 01:58:49.404]  uh... where uh... just all sorts of things happen and i have the l a times you want to read this whole article mexican cartels outgunned towns
[01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:56.553]  And it says that the police are surrounded by foreign Mexican troops and drug dealers.
[01:58:56.573 --> 01:58:57.294]  They're shot at.
[01:58:57.754 --> 01:58:59.335]  The whole towns have no police.
[01:58:59.375 --> 01:59:00.915]  The police have all stood down.
[01:59:01.316 --> 01:59:03.056]  The towns are now completely overrun.
[01:59:03.076 --> 01:59:04.177]  I don't have time to even read all this.
[01:59:04.217 --> 01:59:05.298]  That's how bad the news is.
[01:59:05.598 --> 01:59:07.159]  I could talk for three hours about this article.
[01:59:07.179 --> 01:59:09.620]  This is the LA Times, by the way, not Jerome Corsi.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:10.840]  Dr. Corsi.
[01:59:11.541 --> 01:59:13.902]  Okay, now this article sounds worse than what he's saying.
[01:59:14.713 --> 01:59:16.094]  Because we're not embellishing here.
[01:59:16.134 --> 01:59:17.936]  I know it sounds crazy, it is crazy.
[01:59:18.296 --> 01:59:23.320]  Rocket attacks, hand grenade attacks, car bombs in Texas, mass death, criminals everywhere.
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:25.161]  And they just let them go.
[01:59:25.181 --> 01:59:30.965]  400 plus thousand aggravated felons in 2005 released out of Houston alone.
[01:59:31.926 --> 01:59:35.849]  That's because with 7 million people in the metro area, 2 million are illegal aliens.
[01:59:35.909 --> 01:59:39.392]  Folks, this country is in free fall right now.
[01:59:39.992 --> 01:59:42.154]  Dr. Corsi, I'm reading this article that just came out today.
[01:59:42.174 --> 01:59:43.375]  I don't know if you've seen it yet.
[01:59:44.411 --> 01:59:49.515]  Uh, but, uh, this is describing the total implosion of the country.
[01:59:49.976 --> 01:59:57.161]  And now, of course, we've been talking about it for years, it's finally on CNN, El Senito flying the Mexican flag, not allowed to use English in court proceedings.
[01:59:57.922 --> 02:00:01.685]  Uh, I mean, this is, is it that it's so unbelievable people just can't believe it?
[02:00:02.145 --> 02:00:11.853]  Well, I think, yes, I think it's critical, Alex, for instance, with the Trans-Texas Corridor, you know, people were saying, oh, they won't build this new four football fields wide highway.
[02:00:12.611 --> 02:00:17.314]  Now that Governor Perry has vetoed the legislation blocking it, they're going to build it.
[02:00:17.834 --> 02:00:21.616]  And what I have in the book is, you can see the artist's conception of it.
[02:00:21.717 --> 02:00:32.543]  I link to the documents from the Texas Department of Transportation, like I do in all my writings, of World Wide Daily and Human Events, so people can see the original documents themselves.
[02:00:33.163 --> 02:00:41.669]  With this highway, which is going to be built, financed by Cintra, C-I-N-T-R-A in Spain, they'll own the leasing rights on it for 50 years.
[02:00:43.347 --> 02:00:52.672]  And Giuliani's, Rudy Giuliani's law firm, Bracewell and Giuliani in Houston does all the exclusive legal work for Sintra in the United States.
[02:00:53.212 --> 02:01:04.078]  Giuliani also got Sintra to lease the Chicago Skyway and the Indiana Coal Road along with a investment consortium in Australia.
[02:01:04.938 --> 02:01:08.720]  And it puts Giuliani squarely in the globalist column.
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:12.442]  He's making millions of dollars through that law firm doing the bidding
[02:01:13.021 --> 02:01:17.443]  The Spanish Investment Consortium that wants to build the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:01:17.463 --> 02:01:26.346]  150 years ago, the great powers, the U.S., Russia, England, and France, and others, broke up China into different parts.
[02:01:27.407 --> 02:01:29.048]  Isn't that really what's happening to the U.S.?
[02:01:29.068 --> 02:01:30.228]  Isn't that what globalism is?
[02:01:30.328 --> 02:01:32.689]  Is they just walk in here and just grab everything they want?
[02:01:33.209 --> 02:01:36.931]  Well, the problem is, the globalists are doing that, Alex.
[02:01:36.971 --> 02:01:39.752]  Now that they're buying up infrastructure in the United States,
[02:01:40.450 --> 02:01:47.535]  And building these north-south highways, and I document that, you know, the Trans-Texas Corridor, Interstate 35, is not the only one.
[02:01:48.035 --> 02:01:55.900]  You've also got the Plains to Ports Corridor, going into Denver, up through Dalhark, Texas, and the Panhandle, Oklahoma.
[02:01:56.701 --> 02:02:03.745]  And it's going to use the same Trans-Texas Corridor model, four football fields, wide a highway, in the rural areas.
[02:02:04.306 --> 02:02:06.387]  And you say to Denver, where's the port?
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:09.241]  Well, the port is down in Lazaro Cardenas.
[02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:14.663]  It's the Mexican port through which these millions of Chinese containers... They're on the Pacific side.
[02:02:14.703 --> 02:02:21.286]  Dr. Corsi, I want to get you up again next week to break all this down and talk more about your book, The Late Great USA.
[02:02:21.626 --> 02:02:23.447]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:02:23.467 --> 02:02:24.688]  I want to talk to you for just one moment.
[02:02:24.988 --> 02:02:26.268]  During the break, we're going to let you go.
[02:02:26.308 --> 02:02:30.490]  We've got Michael Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com joining us on the other side.
[02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:36.413]  We're going to do a world report on a host of news issues we have here in front of us that we haven't even addressed yet.
[02:02:37.623 --> 02:02:39.665]  Dr. Corsi, again, thank you for joining us.
[02:02:40.145 --> 02:02:40.906]  Great pleasure, Alex.
[02:02:40.946 --> 02:02:44.589]  Thank you.
[02:02:45.690 --> 02:02:51.995]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.316 --> 02:02:54.257]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.638 --> 02:03:02.244]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.955 --> 02:03:10.019]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.419 --> 02:03:21.825]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.145 --> 02:03:25.627]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.108 --> 02:03:28.049]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.369 --> 02:03:32.151]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:46.448 --> 02:03:55.533]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.773 --> 02:04:07.000]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:13.043]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.283 --> 02:04:19.948]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.148 --> 02:04:26.974]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:27.234 --> 02:04:29.015]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:04:29.275 --> 02:04:31.237]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:04:31.237 --> 02:04:34.498]  Let's get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.

[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:48.521]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:04:48.701 --> 02:04:53.942]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:04:54.202 --> 02:04:59.504]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:59.924 --> 02:05:01.004]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:01.404 --> 02:05:10.487]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[02:05:46.397 --> 02:05:52.018]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:54.939]  He joins us for an hour once a month.
[02:05:54.999 --> 02:05:56.859]  It's always very informative.
[02:05:56.959 --> 02:05:57.819]  I always learn something.
[02:05:58.259 --> 02:06:04.961]  He's in there in the top ten people who knows the most about the New World Order and how the whole system operates and he really has got his details together.
[02:06:05.421 --> 02:06:11.642]  He is the head honcho over there at WhatReallyHappened.com, the founder of that, one of the first alternative websites.
[02:06:12.403 --> 02:06:13.044]  We're good to go.
[02:06:27.616 --> 02:06:37.482]  I mean, it's a positive proviso in that you know that when you purchase the great books and videos that we carry by other filmmakers and authors at Infowars.com, that you're supporting them as well as us.
[02:06:37.562 --> 02:06:43.085]  Plus, most importantly, and this is A, you're getting powerful information and becoming more informed yourself.
[02:06:43.125 --> 02:06:44.465]  And none of us know it all.
[02:06:44.745 --> 02:06:45.906]  We're always learning more.
[02:06:46.466 --> 02:06:47.547]  And knowledge is power.
[02:06:47.567 --> 02:06:54.771]  I mean, even if you're a self-righteous, fully yourself yuppie that doesn't care about the country, knowing about the New World Order is good for business.
[02:06:55.333 --> 02:06:59.034]  Just for your investments and what stocks you pick, believe me.
[02:06:59.855 --> 02:07:07.757]  I mean, the globalists have literally tens of thousands of employees who just go around collecting data and information on how the New World Order is operating.
[02:07:07.777 --> 02:07:09.338]  It's so big they have to study themselves.
[02:07:10.378 --> 02:07:12.879]  So it's important for you to be informed.
[02:07:13.439 --> 02:07:14.880]  It's cool to be informed.
[02:07:15.732 --> 02:07:19.974]  And, uh, it is, uh, literally, uh, you know, the living water of information.
[02:07:20.014 --> 02:07:22.535]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:07:23.015 --> 02:07:28.338]  Infowars.com is a secure online video and bookstore shopping cart via the Yahoo shopping cart that we have.
[02:07:29.472 --> 02:07:30.553]  Highest level security.
[02:07:31.733 --> 02:07:34.615]  Again, at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:07:35.175 --> 02:07:41.739]  It is now available, Terror Storm, Final Edition, Special Edition, 17 minutes of bombshell added info.
[02:07:42.299 --> 02:07:43.680]  This is the best film ever made.
[02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:46.922]  I think it's going to be dwarfed by Endgame, but it's the best I've made up until this time.
[02:07:48.576 --> 02:07:52.957]  The new 7-7 Info, the new 9-11 Info, the Building 7 Info with BBC.
[02:07:53.917 --> 02:07:54.977]  It's so much in there.
[02:07:55.017 --> 02:07:59.098]  Go read on InfoWars.com the write-up on the new Terror Storm.
[02:07:59.198 --> 02:08:00.018]  Available now.
[02:08:00.058 --> 02:08:00.978]  You can order it now.
[02:08:01.438 --> 02:08:03.199]  Shipping out to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:03.579 --> 02:08:07.679]  Terror Storm Final Edition, Special Edition, Final Cut, whatever you want to call it.
[02:08:07.699 --> 02:08:10.560]  It's the last time I'm, you know, it's the second version.
[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:11.620]  It's the last version, too.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:14.321]  And it is a Special Edition, so I don't know what you want to call it.
[02:08:14.361 --> 02:08:16.241]  We call it Special Edition, but it's really more than that.
[02:08:16.881 --> 02:08:18.701]  Available at Infowars.com.
[02:08:20.102 --> 02:08:31.324]  And while you're there, get America Freedom to Fascism, get Loose Chain 2nd Edition, get 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions, or Riddles in Stone, or the other books and videos we carry.
[02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:33.184]  Look at all the discounts we've got.
[02:08:33.224 --> 02:08:35.525]  You can get some of my films as low as $5.95 a piece.
[02:08:36.445 --> 02:08:38.105]  Infowars.com.
[02:08:38.585 --> 02:08:41.786]  And when you get my videos, don't forget, make copies of them aggressively.
[02:08:42.583 --> 02:08:44.685]  That way it's high quality digital copies.
[02:08:44.845 --> 02:08:47.427]  It's not just some download off the web that you burn to disk.
[02:08:47.467 --> 02:08:48.128]  Which is okay.
[02:08:48.148 --> 02:08:48.989]  That's what you got to do it.
[02:08:49.329 --> 02:08:50.350]  But this is even better!
[02:08:51.231 --> 02:08:52.892]  Because it is a DVD.
[02:08:52.972 --> 02:08:54.073]  It's high quality.
[02:08:54.593 --> 02:08:56.015]  Get my three Police State films.
[02:08:56.075 --> 02:08:58.036]  Now in a box set.
[02:08:58.056 --> 02:08:59.338]  45% off.
[02:08:59.358 --> 02:08:59.338]  $34.95.
[02:08:59.638 --> 02:09:00.258]  Three films.
[02:09:00.318 --> 02:09:01.860]  Three DVDs in one box set.
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:03.141]  The Police State Trilogy.
[02:09:03.181 --> 02:09:04.342]  Now available in a trilogy.
[02:09:05.570 --> 02:09:08.815]  Uh, Matrix of Evil, available on DVD now.
[02:09:08.835 --> 02:09:09.757]  We got it transferred over.
[02:09:09.777 --> 02:09:12.140]  Uh, Masters of Terror available.
[02:09:12.661 --> 02:09:14.564]  All at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:09:19.233 --> 02:09:25.876]  And coming up Wednesday, we're going to have the download version for PrisonPlanet.TV members of TerrorStorm Special Edition available.
[02:09:26.296 --> 02:09:31.739]  And then by the end of the week, maybe even sooner, I'm just giving myself a few extra days here, we're going to have a flash version.
[02:09:31.779 --> 02:09:35.841]  We're just testing and getting all the extra servers lined up so you can stream it.
[02:09:36.684 --> 02:09:37.144]  What's the point?
[02:09:37.164 --> 02:09:39.064]  In the past we took the streaming down because it didn't look good.
[02:09:39.425 --> 02:09:43.385]  This is high quality flash streaming so you can watch it in live time instead of downloading it.
[02:09:43.785 --> 02:09:46.886]  I like downloading it because it's three or four times better than Google Video.
[02:09:46.906 --> 02:09:50.827]  I mean, you can find all my stuff for free on Google Video and that's great, but it looks muddy.
[02:09:50.867 --> 02:09:51.507]  It isn't that good.
[02:09:52.247 --> 02:09:53.547]  Get it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:09:53.567 --> 02:09:57.028]  It downloads crisp and clear and that is good to burn to disk and get out to people.
[02:09:57.348 --> 02:10:03.649]  So it's an armory, a literal arsenal of info war at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:10:03.789 --> 02:10:04.729]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[02:10:06.019 --> 02:10:11.203]  And go to MichaelRiveroWhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:10:11.223 --> 02:10:13.645]  And Mike, again, it's always great to have you here with us.
[02:10:14.486 --> 02:10:17.389]  I never do pre-interviews with you, what you want to talk about, what I want to talk about.
[02:10:17.809 --> 02:10:32.001]  You can talk about any subject I raise, because you're a news junkie, news hound, research hound, par excellence, like myself, two birds of a feather, flapping around together, but with different perspectives and different angles, which always brings us to a higher level of understanding.
[02:10:32.561 --> 02:10:35.245]  But I keep meaning to get to this, and I haven't in the last week or two.
[02:10:35.626 --> 02:10:40.552]  London Guardian says 19.6% of the U.S.
[02:10:40.593 --> 02:10:43.116]  fines of Chinese goods are substandard or poisonous.
[02:10:43.657 --> 02:10:44.117]  That's almost 20%.
[02:10:45.019 --> 02:10:47.182]  Chinese internal reports are saying upwards of 30%.
[02:10:48.678 --> 02:10:49.099]  Yeah, I think.
[02:11:05.035 --> 02:11:05.435]  I don't know.
[02:11:25.186 --> 02:11:30.030]  I mean, this is ultra-massive, and is this just the Chinese going insane?
[02:11:30.370 --> 02:11:32.652]  I know that they've been rioting nationwide.
[02:11:32.692 --> 02:11:34.473]  The government's on the verge of collapsing.
[02:11:34.874 --> 02:11:36.195]  That's been kept very quiet.
[02:11:36.395 --> 02:11:38.497]  There's Tiananmen Squares every week there now.
[02:11:39.177 --> 02:11:49.145]  I think there's something really big going on in China, and I think this breakdown of these semi-slave-wage factories and slave factories, I think is part of a rebellion.
[02:11:49.325 --> 02:11:51.226]  Now, that's my gut from the analysis.
[02:11:51.507 --> 02:11:52.267]  We don't know.
[02:11:52.347 --> 02:11:53.168]  What's your gut tell you?
[02:11:54.309 --> 02:12:05.251]  Well, like you, when I first heard about these stories, I thought it was just China bashing an economic war, because China's prices are too difficult, really, to beat coming into the American marketplace.
[02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:14.433]  But if I can share an anecdotal story with you, I like to have little toys around my office, and a while back, I actually bought this little toy ray gun.
[02:12:14.453 --> 02:12:22.155]  It has all kinds of lights all over it, and it's stamped Made in China, and there's a company name, and amazingly enough, it's got a real laser inside it.
[02:12:22.711 --> 02:12:23.011]  Thank you!
[02:12:42.587 --> 02:12:50.894]  It's probably being encouraged because it made China profitable and they had vast amounts of money coming in from these very quickly made, not well thought out products being sent out.
[02:12:51.154 --> 02:12:52.855]  But now it's coming back to haunt them.
[02:12:53.216 --> 02:12:55.437]  And there's this huge, huge backlash.
[02:12:56.278 --> 02:13:03.564]  And yeah, we're between the pet food problem that we had, unsafe toys like the one that I've got right here, and these other issues.
[02:13:03.604 --> 02:13:05.025]  Yeah, there seems to be a real problem.
[02:13:05.065 --> 02:13:07.787]  Now, I do note that China did execute
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:14.003]  They're one of their former government ministers that was having to deal with food and drug safety.
[02:13:14.403 --> 02:13:21.126]  So China at least seems to have a really good handle on what you do with a corrupt politician who is allowing these things to happen.
[02:13:21.566 --> 02:13:32.772]  So China is clearly trying to take steps because if people become aware that Chinese products are not only just cheap but actually dangerous, obviously this is going to impact their sales around the world.
[02:13:33.685 --> 02:13:36.426]  And their entire economy could ultimately collapse.
[02:13:36.586 --> 02:13:56.253]  But obviously, I mean, something this big can't just be because this one executive, Xing Xiong, I can't pronounce it, headline AP, China executes ex-food and drug chief, China executed the former head of its food and drug watchdog today for approving untested medicine in exchange for cash.
[02:13:56.614 --> 02:14:00.155]  That was just in one case, but now they've got blood products that are fake on the wall,
[02:14:00.635 --> 02:14:05.896]  The strongest signal yet that Beijing, that it's serious about tackling its product safety crisis.
[02:14:06.336 --> 02:14:13.858]  Beijing does that when Bayer knowingly ships AIDS-laden and hepatitis-laden blood product around the world, though there's no executions there.
[02:14:14.118 --> 02:14:15.198]  That is an important point.
[02:14:15.559 --> 02:14:18.619]  Here, there is also not the liability.
[02:14:19.559 --> 02:14:21.740]  So again, it just shows an overall breakdown of society.
[02:14:23.673 --> 02:14:42.370]  Well, I think it definitely shows... Well, let me back up for here a second, and using our own country as an example, it is a reality that nations as a whole, any organized structure as a whole, whether it's a home, a business, or a nation, is going to inherit the morality of those people at the very, very top.
[02:14:42.671 --> 02:14:49.417]  So if you have this guy at the top of the food and drug pyramid of authority in China, and he's taking money to allow shoddy products out,
[02:14:50.101 --> 02:14:57.667]  That sends a clear message to everybody down below him that this is okay to do, and this kind of corruption and rot very quickly spreads throughout the system.
[02:14:58.808 --> 02:15:12.618]  And by executing the man at the top, China has sent a clear message that I think will probably have a very cooling effect on these kind of practices, not only in the direct organizational structure underneath this guy, but probably in
[02:15:13.138 --> 02:15:19.841]  In the government as a whole, people will say, okay, the times are changing and we can't get away with what we were being allowed to get away with before.
[02:15:20.221 --> 02:15:32.285]  And there's no question that for it to have gotten as bad as it did, that China was kind of turning a bit of a blind eye and a nudge nudge wink wink to some of these things that were going on because it was improving profitability.
[02:15:32.305 --> 02:15:38.708]  It was bringing money in that China desperately needed and it was establishing China as this manufacturer around the world.
[02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:45.000]  A backlash like this could really undo a tremendous amount of the progress they've made over the last few years.
[02:15:45.340 --> 02:16:04.445]  I remember a story from just a few years back where a Chinese capacitor company stole the formula for the electrolyte from another company but got the formula wrong and started putting out all these capacitors that were used in computer products and motherboards all over the place and these computers all started failing.
[02:16:04.907 --> 02:16:11.332]  So, again, these shortcuts in the name of making sales and profits, they're coming home to roost.
[02:16:11.832 --> 02:16:13.053]  And there is no royal road.
[02:16:13.073 --> 02:16:21.280]  If you're going to put out a product, you have to, at some point, make sure it's going to do what it says it will do and back that up, or customers are going to look for other products.
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:22.961]  And it doesn't matter how cheap they are.
[02:16:23.381 --> 02:16:26.143]  People will spend the extra money to get something they know they can rely on.
[02:16:26.804 --> 02:16:29.026]  And to me, this is a symptom of something wider.
[02:16:29.046 --> 02:16:32.388]  I mean, where you have almost $4 trillion now, it was 2001, folks, it was $1.9 trillion.
[02:16:35.214 --> 02:16:37.496]  You've got almost four trillion disappeared from the Pentagon.
[02:16:38.497 --> 02:16:40.498]  We've got wall-to-wall corruption everywhere.
[02:16:41.639 --> 02:16:44.281]  We've got police engaging in more and more corrupt activities.
[02:16:44.321 --> 02:16:47.303]  We've got drug cartels running wild.
[02:16:47.343 --> 02:16:56.470]  I mean, just looking at the information and the actual statistics, it seems like this is a global phenomenon of just corruption running wild.
[02:16:57.571 --> 02:17:02.675]  Do you think the top social planners are concerned that this could cause some type of chain reaction?
[02:17:03.822 --> 02:17:05.864]  I think they ought to be very, very concerned.
[02:17:05.924 --> 02:17:09.206]  Now, again, I think there's been a lot of corruption all along.
[02:17:09.306 --> 02:17:20.453]  I think it is because of the Internet driving the media now, because of alternative radio shows like yours driving the media and making these stories important, that we're more aware of it than it used to be.
[02:17:20.513 --> 02:17:25.216]  And because the people are more aware of it, they're more angry about it, they're getting ready to do something about it.
[02:17:25.763 --> 02:17:32.149]  I think the planners in our government certainly ought to be very concerned about the possibility of a violent revolution in the very near future.
[02:17:32.449 --> 02:17:33.771]  I don't like the idea of it.
[02:17:34.071 --> 02:17:37.574]  I'm, you know, trying to find reasons to discourage people from going that route.
[02:17:38.015 --> 02:17:42.679]  But ultimately, I see our nation heading along the same path that Romania did some years back.
[02:17:43.019 --> 02:17:43.560]  I agree.
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:44.000]  Stay there.
[02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:45.642]  Let's come back and talk about the dollar and a lot more.
[02:17:46.307 --> 02:17:51.533]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:17:51.673 --> 02:17:59.782]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:18:00.022 --> 02:18:07.090]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:18:07.250 --> 02:18:08.531]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:18:08.611 --> 02:18:14.515]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:18:14.695 --> 02:18:19.799]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:18:19.899 --> 02:18:28.785]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:18:29.045 --> 02:18:32.348]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.569]  I think?
[02:18:45.848 --> 02:18:50.091]  Ted Anderson for Midas July 10, 2007 Gold 660, Hans Gold Coins could be purchased for $6.8197, $3.3650 for half, $1.6825 for quarter.
[02:18:50.131 --> 02:18:50.552]  That's $6.8197, $3.3680, and $1.6825.
[02:18:50.672 --> 02:18:54.635]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in Euro.
[02:18:54.655 --> 02:18:56.696]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[02:18:56.716 --> 02:18:57.317]  Bad news for U.S.
[02:18:57.337 --> 02:18:57.557]  currency.
[02:19:12.268 --> 02:19:14.428]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[02:19:14.588 --> 02:19:16.029]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[02:19:16.269 --> 02:19:18.369]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[02:19:18.489 --> 02:19:19.569]  Erosion accelerates.
[02:19:19.749 --> 02:19:22.290]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[02:19:22.470 --> 02:19:24.350]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[02:19:24.550 --> 02:19:27.051]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[02:19:27.251 --> 02:19:28.191]  Why attack Iran?
[02:19:28.331 --> 02:19:31.332]  Jerome O'Coursey's Iran leads attack against the U.S.
[02:19:31.372 --> 02:19:32.832]  dollar document spells it out.

[02:19:35.452 --> 02:19:38.893]  The value of your hard-earned money is being destroyed in a global game of chess.

[02:19:42.675 --> 02:19:43.055]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.095 --> 02:19:49.519]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[02:20:05.868 --> 02:20:06.208]  I think so.
[02:20:27.982 --> 02:20:28.983]  Are you lacking energy on a daily basis?
[02:20:29.043 --> 02:20:30.265]  Do you feel tired all the time?
[02:20:53.271 --> 02:20:54.392]  We're good to go.

[02:21:46.589 --> 02:21:49.992]  In constant sorrow, he stays at heart.
[02:22:08.206 --> 02:22:22.177]  You know, I spend a lot of time bashing what I call yuppies, and that's oversimplification.
[02:22:22.277 --> 02:22:24.999]  I mean the trendy types.
[02:22:25.099 --> 02:22:29.843]  I don't care if you're a hippie or a cowboy type or...
[02:22:38.655 --> 02:22:40.276]  You know, a black guy.
[02:22:40.296 --> 02:22:41.598]  I mean, you're establishment.
[02:22:41.638 --> 02:22:42.919]  You're into whatever you're told.
[02:22:42.959 --> 02:22:45.541]  You're into going with whatever the media says is the coolest thing.
[02:22:45.861 --> 02:22:48.403]  You believe whatever CNN and Fox News say.
[02:22:48.423 --> 02:22:51.886]  I remember two years ago seeing the Financial Times of London.
[02:22:52.086 --> 02:22:53.627]  Much more important than Wall Street Journal.
[02:22:54.468 --> 02:22:55.789]  Because they tell it like it is there.
[02:22:55.809 --> 02:22:58.171]  You know, they'll spin it a little bit so the public doesn't get it.
[02:22:58.472 --> 02:23:00.233]  But it's also got messages to the elite.
[02:23:00.793 --> 02:23:03.055]  And they said, we're going to lower the U.S.
[02:23:03.075 --> 02:23:04.797]  economy slowly so they don't panic.
[02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:09.393]  We're going to debase it to third world status, and it's going to be done over the next five years.
[02:23:09.413 --> 02:23:15.218]  But they said, elites are worried, though, that there'll be a rush to exit the dollar that will cause a global depression.
[02:23:15.878 --> 02:23:20.222]  And they said, part of the New World Order is to bring down America, and that's good.
[02:23:20.882 --> 02:23:23.404]  England will rise as the preeminent, dominant force in Europe.
[02:23:24.165 --> 02:23:26.366]  We'll invade Iraq and do all the dirty work for them.
[02:23:26.406 --> 02:23:28.148]  And they just spelled it all out.
[02:23:28.168 --> 02:23:30.670]  It was a series of articles, and I made a big deal out of it.
[02:23:31.654 --> 02:23:35.617]  Now, the Euro was at 82 cents against the dollar in October of 2000.
[02:23:35.777 --> 02:23:36.698]  This is AP.
[02:23:37.078 --> 02:23:41.541]  It's now at 137 plus, and every week now going up about a half a cent.
[02:23:42.161 --> 02:23:47.264]  Now that's over a 50% increase in value against the dollar and a massive drop in value of the dollar.
[02:23:47.745 --> 02:23:51.667]  Mike Rivero, they said they'd do it incrementally so we wouldn't notice.
[02:23:52.408 --> 02:24:00.033]  But I mean, I can't, literally I talk to average Americans, or I'll be at the neighborhood pool, you know, middle class community pool, but you know, there's middle class people there.
[02:24:00.769 --> 02:24:01.870]  They'll say, hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:24:01.930 --> 02:24:03.110]  People that are even neighbors of mine.
[02:24:03.771 --> 02:24:05.412]  And I'll go, hey, you know, the dollar's been devalued.
[02:24:05.752 --> 02:24:07.132]  They don't know what that means.
[02:24:07.913 --> 02:24:09.934]  Or I'll bring up eugenics.
[02:24:10.414 --> 02:24:11.255]  What's your new film about?
[02:24:11.595 --> 02:24:12.075]  Eugenics.
[02:24:12.195 --> 02:24:12.755]  What's that?
[02:24:12.775 --> 02:24:15.257]  I mean, how did we get so stupid?
[02:24:15.797 --> 02:24:17.878]  My grandma knows what eugenics is.
[02:24:17.938 --> 02:24:20.039]  She knows what dollar devaluation is.
[02:24:20.419 --> 02:24:23.401]  Is it just that she's 80-something years old and has lived long enough to see it, Mike?
[02:24:25.088 --> 02:24:29.212]  Probably, and a lot of it has to do, obviously, with mainstream media's desire to keep us distracted.
[02:24:29.252 --> 02:24:40.001]  I bet if you went back to those same people at that pool and asked them about Paris Hilton or Anna Nicole Smith, they would have all the information right there at hand to carry on what they believe to be a meaningful and important conversation.
[02:24:40.682 --> 02:24:42.803]  So, there's a big part of it right there.
[02:24:43.104 --> 02:24:52.712]  But, sooner or later, what they have to notice is that the prices they are paying for just about everything are going up, because since America does not do that much manufacturing anymore,
[02:24:53.197 --> 02:24:56.421]  We are still importing most of our products from everywhere else in the world.
[02:24:56.882 --> 02:25:00.206]  And if the dollar devalues, it takes more dollars to buy those.
[02:25:01.007 --> 02:25:10.919]  Certainly anybody who is purchasing high-tech equipment notices the cost of cameras and lenses and video equipment is continuing to rise.
[02:25:11.039 --> 02:25:11.699]  Software!
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:12.440]  Software!
[02:25:13.533 --> 02:25:21.217]  Yeah, well, anything high-tech, which is now being made outside the U.S., we have to pay more to get it because the dollars are absolutely worth less.
[02:25:21.577 --> 02:25:40.907]  But even setting aside issues of New World Order, common sense has to tell you that if there is an attempt to merge Canada, the United States, and Mexico into the North American Union, that the inevitable result, indeed the inevitable precursor of that, is that the working-class Americans and working-class Canadians
[02:25:41.457 --> 02:25:49.624]  Have to be somehow tricked or coerced into lowering their standard of living to something that is approaching the working class of Mexico.
[02:25:50.185 --> 02:25:55.790]  Otherwise, you know, with the Mexican labor being able to basically walk over the borders and take jobs,
[02:25:56.563 --> 02:25:57.484]  We're all going to have to.
[02:25:57.504 --> 02:26:01.426]  The middle class is going to have to take lower salaries and lower wages.
[02:26:01.446 --> 02:26:09.750]  Now they tell the right wing that we're giving up our liberties and the economy's having problems because of Al-Qaeda and if we just attack Iran everything will be okay.
[02:26:10.151 --> 02:26:13.032]  The left's being told we've got to have global government, global tax.
[02:26:13.052 --> 02:26:16.434]  They've introduced legislation today for a carbon tax in the U.S.
[02:26:16.474 --> 02:26:17.615]  Canada just passed one.
[02:26:18.275 --> 02:26:20.717]  I mean, it's happening, folks, so can you speak to that?
[02:26:20.757 --> 02:26:24.599]  I mean, that's also going to be their excuse of why we've got to lower our standard of living.
[02:26:24.859 --> 02:26:40.449]  The oil's running out, and it's a tax for the earth, and... Yeah, the whole global warming thing is being fanned because it's just another scare tactic to get people to surrender control over their own lives, to make do with less so the government can have more,
[02:26:40.822 --> 02:26:44.364]  I mean, looking at this Live Earth concert, this was really a joke.
[02:26:44.444 --> 02:26:56.712]  I mean, you had all these rock stars flying in in their private jet aircraft, you know, belching tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, riding to the venue in their gas-guzzling huge limousines,
[02:26:57.122 --> 02:27:09.752]  Dancing around under millions of watts of lighting, with thousands of watts of sound equipment, blasting out how we, the rest of us, must live much smaller, more austere lives in order to be good to the Earth.
[02:27:09.772 --> 02:27:13.755]  Well, that's like Ted Turner said, there should be a law, you can only have one child, he's got five children.
[02:27:14.976 --> 02:27:15.456]  Exactly.
[02:27:15.516 --> 02:27:20.300]  If you look at Al Gore's own house, it is hardly what we would call energy or environmentally friendly.
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:21.981]  Well, I think it's 12,000 square feet.
[02:27:24.324 --> 02:27:25.185]  And very wasteful.
[02:27:25.245 --> 02:27:27.328]  It doesn't have much in the way of solar.
[02:27:27.368 --> 02:27:28.389]  It's not well insulated.
[02:27:28.449 --> 02:27:29.770]  It is just a very wasteful house.
[02:27:30.451 --> 02:27:30.731]  Stay there.
[02:27:30.751 --> 02:27:34.455]  I want to come back and talk more about this, because they're making their big move right now.
[02:27:34.816 --> 02:27:35.416]  Mike Rivera.
[02:27:36.337 --> 02:27:37.258]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.739 --> 02:27:39.341]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.262 --> 02:27:42.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.417 --> 02:27:58.365]  JLS Research, the makers of the all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates that those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[02:27:58.505 --> 02:28:05.250]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[02:28:05.370 --> 02:28:12.715]  By using organic and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[02:28:13.075 --> 02:28:16.138]  As it responds, body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[02:28:16.439 --> 02:28:20.082]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[02:28:20.362 --> 02:28:23.766]  Grape seed skins, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[02:28:24.026 --> 02:28:27.890]  It's so effective, you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the
[02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:29.011]  We're good to go.
[02:28:46.602 --> 02:28:49.125]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:28:49.626 --> 02:28:54.112]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[02:28:54.653 --> 02:29:00.941]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[02:29:00.961 --> 02:29:04.546]  38% higher than Bill Clinton's highest budget.
[02:29:05.126 --> 02:29:14.471]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:29:32.602 --> 02:29:33.102]  It's free!

[02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:52.896]  You may be sitting there right now wondering how you're going to make it through the day, the night, the next plane flight, job interview, or social event.
[02:29:53.296 --> 02:29:54.117]  Maybe you'll have a drink.
[02:29:54.477 --> 02:29:55.698]  Maybe you'll take another pill.
[02:29:56.199 --> 02:29:59.782]  Maybe you're so anxious and depressed that you just really can't help yourself.
[02:30:00.262 --> 02:30:03.645]  Do you worry yourself sick, beat yourself up, or put yourself down?
[02:30:04.305 --> 02:30:04.906]  I don't think so.
[02:30:26.553 --> 02:30:27.854]  I think we're good to go.
[02:31:02.571 --> 02:31:11.418]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board And let this train keep on riding, riding on through
[02:31:28.101 --> 02:31:37.885]  We're going to open the phones up for Michael Rivera if you'd like to get involved on air.
[02:31:38.045 --> 02:31:38.225]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:58.167 --> 02:32:01.989]  It is the 10th day of July, 2007, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:32:02.049 --> 02:32:07.693]  Don't forget, we have a free podcast for this show every day when the broadcast ends.
[02:32:08.293 --> 02:32:10.114]  It serves out to tens of thousands of you.
[02:32:10.554 --> 02:32:17.178]  And if you're getting the podcast, tell your friends, your neighbors, your email list, your MySpace about the free podcast at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:18.172 --> 02:32:19.152]  That's how we get the word out.
[02:32:19.192 --> 02:32:21.833]  It's how we reach more people, is thanks to you.
[02:32:21.853 --> 02:32:24.313]  I want to thank those that have spread the word, and ask you to spread the word again.
[02:32:24.333 --> 02:32:30.094]  And I want to ask the majority of you who haven't really been spreading the word, to help us spread the word, and that's how we're going to win this InfoWars.
[02:32:30.654 --> 02:32:37.856]  Also, we restream the show 21 hours a day after the live show ends, here on the network at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:37.876 --> 02:32:42.357]  You can listen how you want, when you want, to the stream of the show, or to the podcast.
[02:32:46.934 --> 02:32:48.635]  You know, we keep talking about revolution.
[02:32:48.715 --> 02:33:05.568]  I mean, there are all sorts of different revolutions of technology, of information, of culture going on, but when you talk about a violent revolution, certainly the government and some think tanks have said they, the British report of this year, and this is their Ministry of Defense,
[02:33:06.657 --> 02:33:07.257]  Projection.
[02:33:07.297 --> 02:33:10.558]  They say they believe there will be worldwide riots.
[02:33:10.598 --> 02:33:12.098]  They believe there will be flash mobs.
[02:33:12.858 --> 02:33:15.859]  They say, because of what globalism, i.e.
[02:33:15.999 --> 02:33:18.420]  New World Order, is going to do, that we are going to resist.
[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:26.441]  The question is, they don't say what is going to be so horrible that people spontaneously riot and kill the police.
[02:33:29.262 --> 02:33:30.802]  Because the report doesn't get into that.
[02:33:30.842 --> 02:33:31.563]  We, of course, know.
[02:33:31.863 --> 02:33:33.463]  I want to get your take on what that could be.
[02:33:34.824 --> 02:33:36.425]  Well, I think just in general.
[02:33:36.485 --> 02:33:44.372]  I mean, there's a segment of society, which is obviously the audience listening to us right now, who are very informed and educated as to what's going on.
[02:33:44.772 --> 02:33:49.556]  But even those people who are watching regular TV and don't understand the facts,
[02:33:50.046 --> 02:33:53.149]  At some level in their consciousness, they're feeling the pressure.
[02:33:53.449 --> 02:33:56.611]  They're feeling the loss of their standard of living.
[02:33:56.871 --> 02:33:59.073]  They're feeling the constriction of all the rules.
[02:33:59.293 --> 02:34:01.615]  They don't like being fondled going through the airports.
[02:34:01.875 --> 02:34:09.041]  There was a story the other day about how some police tried to confiscate some fireworks and apparently the parties just beat the cops up.
[02:34:09.574 --> 02:34:17.018]  Because they see more and more the police aren't there to enforce the basic laws of no stealing, no killing, but to enforce certain property rights.
[02:34:17.098 --> 02:34:21.620]  All over the country they're arresting people walking down the street handing out Ron Paul flyers.
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:23.241]  I mean, all over.
[02:34:23.281 --> 02:34:25.982]  I mean, YouTube and the video online.
[02:34:26.402 --> 02:34:29.704]  I mean, I see the cops and I can't believe they act this bad.
[02:34:30.084 --> 02:34:31.204]  I mean, it's embarrassing.
[02:34:31.264 --> 02:34:32.225]  It embarrasses me.
[02:34:32.245 --> 02:34:36.347]  I mean, you ever watch somebody do something embarrassing and you feel embarrassed?
[02:34:36.747 --> 02:34:38.568]  I mean, I can't believe they act like this.
[02:34:40.094 --> 02:34:41.516]  Well, I can certainly believe it.
[02:34:42.336 --> 02:34:46.120]  I saw the beginnings of it when I was still living in Los Angeles with the Ramstein cops.
[02:34:46.221 --> 02:34:49.684]  It really is very shameful.
[02:34:49.724 --> 02:34:52.888]  But again, it's just something that people are becoming more aware of.
[02:34:52.948 --> 02:34:54.069]  It's not a new development.
[02:34:54.349 --> 02:34:55.751]  There have always been bad cops.
[02:34:56.231 --> 02:35:00.335]  But with the Internet, with alternative radio, people are beginning to see it happening.
[02:35:00.676 --> 02:35:01.797]  And I think at some point,
[02:35:02.469 --> 02:35:10.186]  Americans are beginning to realize the total tax rate, all the aggregate taxes added up, amounts to about half of everything people are earning right now.
[02:35:10.326 --> 02:35:12.491]  Almost 60% for people in higher tax brackets.
[02:35:13.749 --> 02:35:14.129]  Almost 60%.
[02:35:14.169 --> 02:35:22.632]  And this is being taken by a government that is pointedly not listening to the will of the American people in regards to the war in Iraq.
[02:35:22.672 --> 02:35:26.254]  I mean, I pay about 40% of the little bit of money I got to these people.
[02:35:27.034 --> 02:35:31.976]  And with all the taxes, I'm kind of in a lower middle class area, but it's worse for people above me.
[02:35:32.496 --> 02:35:34.417]  And I get treated like dog meat by cops.
[02:35:34.437 --> 02:35:35.477]  I mean, what's going on here?
[02:35:36.779 --> 02:35:37.099]  It is!
[02:35:37.279 --> 02:35:41.221]  And it's taxation without representation, because the government is taking the money from you.
[02:35:41.601 --> 02:35:46.223]  They're trying to manufacture issues that you can feel good of being taken care of, like global warming.
[02:35:46.443 --> 02:35:56.027]  But when it comes to the really important things, like Iraq, and staying out of Iran, and the people who lied us into these wars, the government is absolutely not listening to the will of the people.
[02:35:56.127 --> 02:36:04.390]  And nothing demonstrates that more than the current democratically controlled Congress, which was given control of Congress in November of 2006, with a very clear
[02:36:06.295 --> 02:36:11.399]  Unmistakable mandate to end the wars and to prosecute the people who lied us into them.
[02:36:11.759 --> 02:36:15.162]  And as soon as they get in there, you've got Nancy Pelosi saying, well, impeachment's off the table.
[02:36:15.182 --> 02:36:15.782]  We don't have the time.
[02:36:15.802 --> 02:36:16.422]  We don't have the votes.
[02:36:16.743 --> 02:36:23.708]  We have to look at more important, achievable goals, like anti-littering campaigns and Sausalito and things like that.
[02:36:24.208 --> 02:36:26.650]  And it's just one distraction after another.
[02:36:26.730 --> 02:36:28.171]  The Democrats have proven themselves.
[02:36:28.693 --> 02:36:43.325]  No more willing to deal with the issue of Bush's wars than the GOP was, and I'm predicting right now that, all the posturing aside, the Democrats are going to lose Congress in 2008 because the American people have seen they went to Congress and did not do what they were told.
[02:36:43.365 --> 02:36:47.529]  But then the double team still works and then it goes back to the plan B, same people.
[02:36:48.109 --> 02:36:51.793]  The Republicans, now I want to take some calls at 1-800-259-9231 here in just a minute.
[02:36:56.710 --> 02:37:00.374]  That double team, if I can comment, I wanted to get one more thought.
[02:37:00.895 --> 02:37:05.320]  America does see it's a double team, that Republicans and Democrats are just two faces of the same
[02:37:06.245 --> 02:37:10.869]  mechanism and that is why I think at some point there's going to be some kind of an upheaval.
[02:37:11.189 --> 02:37:31.006]  Well yeah, when 91% don't want open borders and 99% don't want North American Union and 97% don't want trans-Texas superhighways and when 75% of the troops, now it was 70, and 87% of the people don't want the war and it just continues!
[02:37:31.186 --> 02:37:33.768]  That shows everybody we're not running this country!
[02:37:35.143 --> 02:37:38.227]  But they still take our money and the promise that we have something to say about it.
[02:37:39.007 --> 02:37:46.436]  But they hear us getting mad and so they militarize the police thinking that a million cops... Try to hire two million.
[02:37:46.456 --> 02:37:47.817]  They're trying to hire two million now.
[02:37:48.578 --> 02:37:50.480]  What do you think two million cops is going to do?
[02:37:50.801 --> 02:37:55.306]  Don't you understand, folks, that you can't run anything if we decide you don't run it?
[02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:57.451]  I don't think they get that, Mike.
[02:37:57.631 --> 02:38:00.232]  We're not, and I'm not knocking people from Russia, but I'm sorry.
[02:38:00.532 --> 02:38:01.812]  We don't, this is not Russia.
[02:38:01.832 --> 02:38:02.793]  We don't have that history.
[02:38:03.253 --> 02:38:18.719]  This is a Anglo-Saxon culture of grabbing the king and chopping his head off, and then you mix into that the wild cultures from all the rest of the world of people who don't put up with bull, and Americans may be fat, dumb, and happy, but I'm telling you, the old instincts to go absolutely ape are still there, Mike.
[02:38:20.518 --> 02:38:36.348]  Absolutely, I agree with that and we do have that long tradition of kicking out the government previously for getting a little out of control and more and more I get reader emails and I don't post them because I'm trying not to get people in trouble but I'm getting so many emails these days of people just saying it is time to start shooting the
[02:38:37.518 --> 02:38:39.879]  In search of a particular obscene qualifier there.
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:42.100]  No, I'm getting hundreds of them.
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:43.601]  Folks, don't start shooting people.
[02:38:43.961 --> 02:38:52.745]  But I'm telling you, I hope the government, and I know they do, there are millions of veterans literally with huge automatic rifles, oil loaded and ready.
[02:38:52.785 --> 02:38:54.946]  They want to start killing you.
[02:38:55.347 --> 02:38:57.167]  I don't think the government fully realizes that, Mike.
[02:38:58.448 --> 02:38:59.248]  Well, they never do.
[02:38:59.308 --> 02:39:04.051]  I mean, every time you look at a government that has fallen, it's because somebody got arrogant and they said, oh, the people,
[02:39:05.125 --> 02:39:15.587]  They will never rise up against us, and then you have the Bastille, or you have Ceausescu getting machine-gunned on national TV, or what happened to Mussolini, or Charles I...
[02:39:16.810 --> 02:39:21.452]  You know, I mean, regicide is a fact of history, and revolution is a fact of history.
[02:39:21.912 --> 02:39:23.392]  I don't like it like you.
[02:39:23.532 --> 02:39:41.438]  I'm encouraging people to stay peaceful and go the Gandhi route, but it is obvious that when the government is taking so much from you, and all they can think of is finding more ways to take more from you, like this Global Warming Central Command that tells you when you can turn your bedroom light on and off, at some point,
[02:39:42.077 --> 02:39:47.440]  Somebody is going to break and say, enough is enough, and that's when things will get very unpleasant.
[02:39:48.341 --> 02:40:00.448]  And then the government, if it happens, when the first people go nuts and start blasting, then the government's going to come out and try to crush it, and then go wild and overreact, and then it's just going to explode from there.
[02:40:01.228 --> 02:40:09.553]  Yeah, it'll just get worse and worse, because all the government can do is repress the general population, and as they've seen in Palestine, that ultimately doesn't work.
[02:40:10.214 --> 02:40:14.875]  Uh, the only way you really get peace in a situation like that is one side kills everybody on the other side.
[02:40:15.415 --> 02:40:20.837]  And that's obviously what Tacitus was referring to when he kept talking about the Roman idea of peace.
[02:40:22.037 --> 02:40:25.558]  Which is, uh, they made a desolation and called it peace.
[02:40:25.898 --> 02:40:28.099]  Yeah, they created a desolation and called it peace.
[02:40:29.013 --> 02:40:44.888]  And that's what we're doing in Iraq, and while I was waiting to come on the show today, I was watching this live broadcast of George Bush doing a town hall meeting in Ohio, where he's still trying to sell this idea that we have to stay in Iraq because it's Al-Qaeda that's causing all the sectarian violence.
[02:40:44.988 --> 02:40:50.052]  But the plan was to break down a first world into a third world, to create desolation, break it in three parts.
[02:40:50.273 --> 02:40:52.635]  We've been saying that for five years, and now it's mainstream news.
[02:40:53.775 --> 02:40:54.415]  Absolutely.
[02:40:54.495 --> 02:40:56.756]  And the thing is, it is a complete, utter disaster.
[02:40:56.836 --> 02:40:59.156]  It is built on the lie of weapons of mass destruction.
[02:40:59.516 --> 02:41:06.838]  And meanwhile, it is very obvious that Bush is trying to find some way to get support from the American people to go into Iran.
[02:41:07.078 --> 02:41:11.299]  And short of staging some other kind of a false flag attack, I don't see how he can get it.
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:19.781]  Well, I think, I mean, I'm sure you heard about the Senator, former Senator, coming out and saying on a radio show, don't worry, there's going to be a big event in the U.S.
[02:41:19.841 --> 02:41:21.822]  in the next year, and then you'll be for attacking Iran.
[02:41:22.873 --> 02:41:31.901]  Yeah, Santorum, it does seem like he's kind of tipped the cards there, but I'll tell you what I'm really more concerned about, instead of next year, is just in the next few weeks.
[02:41:32.742 --> 02:41:39.908]  I notice that we have seen a lot more news coverage of the Enterprise going to the Gulf than any of the other carriers.
[02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:47.255]  If you ask people what carriers we have in the Gulf, they're going to be hard-pressed to name any of them, but everybody knows the Enterprise is there.
[02:41:47.825 --> 02:41:49.286]  And this is an old ship.
[02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:52.427]  It's 46 years old, and it's already scheduled for decommissioning.
[02:41:52.467 --> 02:41:54.167]  You think that's what you've been saying for a year?
[02:41:54.187 --> 02:41:54.928]  They might blow it up?
[02:41:55.728 --> 02:42:04.812]  Yeah, they might do something like that in New Pearl Harbor to say, oh, those dastardly Iranians, they killed all of our kids on our carrier, and the war is off and running.
[02:42:05.592 --> 02:42:13.795]  So, I'm concerned that the Enterprise did seem to be getting a little more news coverage as it went over there than any of the previous carriers did.
[02:42:13.815 --> 02:42:14.415]  I did notice that.
[02:42:14.435 --> 02:42:16.356]  They're personalizing it for us.
[02:42:17.179 --> 02:42:19.581]  Here's your friend, the Enterprise!
[02:42:20.262 --> 02:42:22.163]  Look at it!
[02:42:22.544 --> 02:42:32.572]  A lot of experts are saying that's the card they think they're going to pull is having the carrier go right up into the waters and then having a sub come up and shoot a few
[02:42:34.625 --> 02:42:35.485]  Yeah, very much so.
[02:42:35.505 --> 02:42:36.585]  Well, Bush has to do something.
[02:42:36.605 --> 02:42:39.146]  I mean, just looking at the audience behind him just now on the TV,
[02:43:04.433 --> 02:43:07.524]  Even the people, their screening is acceptable for his town hall meetings.
[02:43:07.584 --> 02:43:10.435]  The looks on their faces, they don't believe him anymore.
[02:43:11.185 --> 02:43:19.329]  Bush, the wheels are coming off his war wagon, and he needs something, desperately, to get his war back on track.
[02:43:19.489 --> 02:43:21.751]  Israel has had the strongest language yet.
[02:43:23.411 --> 02:43:26.273]  They say they're going to attack Iraq in 2002, they do it in 2003.
[02:43:26.313 --> 02:43:33.957]  They love to stretch it out for that subconscious thing where, I don't want the war, Mike doesn't want it, but subconsciously our brain has heard about it so much.
[02:43:34.637 --> 02:43:40.220]  You know, it's kind of like all day the bully says he's meeting you at 3.30 after school to beat you up.
[02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:42.281]  You kind of just can't wait until 3.30.
[02:43:42.681 --> 02:43:48.844]  He may have flunked three grades and be a lot bigger than you and you're 14 years old and he's got a beard, but you just want to get out there and get it over with.
[02:43:49.384 --> 02:43:51.385]  And that's kind of like, okay, get the war over with.
[02:43:51.425 --> 02:43:53.326]  I'm sick of hearing about it all day.
[02:43:53.406 --> 02:43:55.707]  Let this, you know, let high noon come.
[02:43:56.487 --> 02:43:59.689]  But now Israel is saying that they may attack Iran anytime.
[02:44:00.209 --> 02:44:03.891]  And that they're ready for a July attack, but I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[02:44:04.111 --> 02:44:05.171]  The point is, they're saying that.
[02:44:06.252 --> 02:44:19.858]  Yeah, they are saying that, and of course what everybody understands is Israel will start the war against Iran, but Bush will say we must support our friend, and American men and American women are going to be sent in to die in yet another war by Israel's design.
[02:44:19.878 --> 02:44:24.060]  Well, Bush gave a speech two days ago saying that we've got to win in Iraq by going into Iran.
[02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:24.320]  Go ahead.
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:26.241]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:44:26.461 --> 02:44:27.201]  The push is on.
[02:44:27.521 --> 02:44:30.063]  These are wars that Israel obviously wants.
[02:44:30.403 --> 02:44:33.305]  Bush has already stated repeatedly that the U.S.
[02:44:33.345 --> 02:44:37.868]  will back Israel in any regional war, even if Israel strikes the first blow.
[02:44:38.288 --> 02:44:47.153]  And he made a point of saying that, which seemed to me to be able to preempt this idea that if Israel starts a war, we could say, well, you know, Israel started it, why are we involved?
[02:44:47.253 --> 02:44:51.296]  And then we're going to hear, if Iran fights back in any way, they've said that's terrorism.
[02:44:52.737 --> 02:44:53.398]  Absolutely.
[02:44:53.478 --> 02:45:05.066]  And one that I saw today is they're looking at this tunneling project that Iran is doing near one of the nuclear power plant sites and saying, well, Iran is obviously preparing to move their nuclear facility underground.
[02:45:05.106 --> 02:45:06.927]  Well, you've got four or five U.S.
[02:45:06.987 --> 02:45:09.749]  carriers off their shore spoiling for a war.
[02:45:10.109 --> 02:45:12.411]  Of course, Iran is going to take defensive steps.
[02:45:13.131 --> 02:45:16.814]  You know, it's not suspicious for Iran to want to defend itself.
[02:45:16.914 --> 02:45:18.135]  It's suspicious for the U.S.
[02:45:18.395 --> 02:45:20.216]  to have all those carriers off their coast.
[02:45:20.791 --> 02:45:26.633]  And you have to remember, what we're talking about is a nuclear power station, which Iran has a legal right to build.
[02:45:27.033 --> 02:45:28.674]  Well, look, they're not worried about nukes.
[02:45:28.714 --> 02:45:30.154]  They hand them out like hotcakes.
[02:45:30.595 --> 02:45:34.396]  I mean, look at Pakistan running around with the missiles to deliver them.
[02:45:35.036 --> 02:45:39.558]  But I want to take a few calls here, as I promised I would, but Mike, James Hatfield.
[02:45:40.763 --> 02:45:55.798]  Uh, the lead singer Metallica, 6 foot 5, blonde hair, blonde biker, uh, you know, viking style, uh, beard, devil tattoos all over him, uh, lands on a private jet, they arrest him and say he may be Al Qaeda.
[02:45:56.238 --> 02:46:04.623]  I mean, I think they do that on purpose just to illustrate that this is silliness, but we will, you know, do whatever we want to you whenever we want for this LiveAid thing.
[02:46:04.983 --> 02:46:11.646]  Now the Democrats are introducing the Parliamentarian move to be able to introduce full carbon tax legislation in the next session.
[02:46:11.667 --> 02:46:14.148]  I mean, this is just wall-to-wall craziness.
[02:46:15.337 --> 02:46:21.439]  It is, and it's just another excuse to take more money from the people to try and float their debts along, because both the U.S.
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:30.943]  and Great Britain, the governments are so hopelessly in debt from these losing wars, that they're just going to have to find a way to extract it out of their people to get themselves out of this mess.
[02:46:31.183 --> 02:46:33.744]  Personally, in the case of the United States, I don't think they can do it.
[02:46:34.245 --> 02:46:42.988]  I don't think there is enough money in the general population to pay off the amount of debt that they have run up to this point.
[02:46:43.784 --> 02:46:45.645]  We're already at 50% taxation.
[02:46:45.685 --> 02:46:46.165]  What can they do?
[02:46:46.205 --> 02:46:49.287]  Double the taxes to where 100% of everything we make goes to the government?
[02:46:49.307 --> 02:46:52.228]  Well, attacking Iran is just failing forward.
[02:46:52.328 --> 02:46:53.869]  It's overturning the chessboard.
[02:46:53.889 --> 02:47:04.833]  And helping people rally around the government when they totally tank the dollar, because after all, we're in a war with some people somewhere that have brown skin and the general public can't find Iran on a map.
[02:47:05.093 --> 02:47:06.874]  Let's take a quick call here or two.
[02:47:07.675 --> 02:47:09.916]  Let's go to Rob in Kansas.
[02:47:09.956 --> 02:47:10.736]  Thanks for holding, Rob.
[02:47:13.069 --> 02:47:14.409]  Okay, Rob just hung up.
[02:47:14.549 --> 02:47:15.349]  Who's up next there?
[02:47:16.350 --> 02:47:17.670]  Steven, Utah, you're on the air.
[02:47:17.690 --> 02:47:20.831]  Hey, what's up?
[02:47:20.871 --> 02:47:21.551]  Worldwide, sir.
[02:47:21.571 --> 02:47:22.971]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:47:22.991 --> 02:47:24.411]  Hey, this is Steve, Orem, Utah.
[02:47:24.732 --> 02:47:29.332]  Hey, I just had a comment on the grandma beating officer.
[02:47:30.633 --> 02:47:32.273]  I've had trouble with that guy, too.
[02:47:33.113 --> 02:47:40.555]  When I moved in my house, he called and was screaming at me, threatening to get me evicted because I'm not an illegal alien and I had
[02:47:41.564 --> 02:47:43.164]  More than three people living in my house.
[02:47:44.645 --> 02:47:52.186]  Wait a minute, so you live in the same town where this 70 plus year old woman, no criminal record, he just slammed her head in the ground with pleasure.
[02:47:52.726 --> 02:47:55.527]  He said she's in our restaurant for not having green grass.
[02:47:55.887 --> 02:47:56.847]  That's mainstream news.
[02:47:57.127 --> 02:47:57.727]  You know him.
[02:47:58.487 --> 02:48:01.188]  Yeah, this guy, he's got problems.
[02:48:01.208 --> 02:48:02.388]  He's not a very good person.
[02:48:02.408 --> 02:48:04.609]  We were in a gun store, me and my friend.
[02:48:05.389 --> 02:48:07.189]  And me and him are the only people in there.
[02:48:07.709 --> 02:48:08.790]  And then this guy comes in.
[02:48:09.350 --> 02:48:10.810]  And he's sitting over there behind us.
[02:48:11.303 --> 02:48:15.705]  We turn around and we notice he's sighting in a handgun at my friend's head, you know?
[02:48:16.746 --> 02:48:18.386]  And we're like, okay, what's up with that?
[02:48:18.406 --> 02:48:20.247]  So we just left, you know, we thought that sounded weird.
[02:48:20.627 --> 02:48:25.750]  And we go out and his police truck was parked next to my car, so I couldn't even get in my car.
[02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:27.831]  I couldn't open the door far enough to get in.
[02:48:27.891 --> 02:48:29.491]  I had to kind of... So, was it him?
[02:48:30.132 --> 02:48:31.832]  Yeah, his name's Officer Giles.
[02:48:32.233 --> 02:48:33.373]  Yeah, that's in the newspaper.
[02:48:33.393 --> 02:48:34.754]  Yeah, well he took down that woman.
[02:48:34.834 --> 02:48:35.514]  I mean, he's a man.
[02:48:35.534 --> 02:48:37.375]  How you doing, boy?
[02:48:37.395 --> 02:48:37.855]  Well, stay there.
[02:48:37.875 --> 02:48:39.416]  I want to hear more about this on the other side.
[02:48:40.336 --> 02:48:44.397]  That's what true Americans do to take down old women.
[02:48:44.537 --> 02:48:49.759]  It's here.
[02:48:49.939 --> 02:48:54.720]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.100 --> 02:49:02.722]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:10.474]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.874 --> 02:49:22.316]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.616 --> 02:49:26.537]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.577 --> 02:49:28.517]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.837 --> 02:49:32.678]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:03.035 --> 02:50:07.256]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.

[02:50:18.439 --> 02:50:23.940]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:28.782]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.

[02:51:49.051 --> 02:51:50.413]  We're talking to Steve Tiddy.
[02:51:51.775 --> 02:51:52.156]  Tiddy.
[02:51:52.597 --> 02:51:54.319]  And, uh, he lives in Ormond, Utah.
[02:51:55.060 --> 02:51:57.063]  He lives across the street from the wedding event at Word Purpose.
[02:51:57.083 --> 02:52:01.049]  This is a big armored mansion the cops protect from the local townspeople, I guess.
[02:52:01.730 --> 02:52:04.655]  He moved in next door and this guy called up telling him he was gonna evict him.
[02:52:05.799 --> 02:52:07.359]  Because he had three people living in the house.
[02:52:07.679 --> 02:52:10.060]  And this is a special neighborhood cop they have there.
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:11.660]  They have these in a lot of towns.
[02:52:12.160 --> 02:52:16.681]  Then this is the guy, uh, the officer who grabbed the old lady and slammed her down on the concrete.
[02:52:17.102 --> 02:52:20.822]  He said, I'm gonna arrest you, give you a ticket for not having green grass.
[02:52:22.423 --> 02:52:23.343]  Finish up your story.
[02:52:23.363 --> 02:52:24.603]  I'm gonna have Aaron Dykes call you.
[02:52:24.623 --> 02:52:26.024]  I want to do a report on this guy.
[02:52:26.664 --> 02:52:28.024]  And I'm gonna get that lady on as well.
[02:52:28.044 --> 02:52:31.845]  We're working on that lady that got slammed in the ground and said, you better do what he says.
[02:52:31.885 --> 02:52:32.465]  What else happened?
[02:52:33.762 --> 02:52:36.503]  Um, when he called me, he was threatening me.
[02:52:36.843 --> 02:52:39.643]  My landlord called me and said, you know, don't worry about it.
[02:52:40.063 --> 02:52:43.124]  I guess they do it all the time and I was being very polite.
[02:52:43.184 --> 02:52:44.984]  I didn't want to, you know, make him mad.
[02:52:45.364 --> 02:52:52.046]  But I, you know, I felt like I didn't do anything wrong and this guy's calling and threatening me and telling me I'm going to get evicted from my house.
[02:52:52.066 --> 02:52:57.727]  You were at a gun store one day though and you turn around and he's right behind you sighting a gun and how close did he have the gun to your friend's head?
[02:52:58.511 --> 02:53:01.355]  I'm just probably like maybe 10 yards away.
[02:53:01.495 --> 02:53:04.759]  We're just in a, you know, a decent-sized store.
[02:53:04.859 --> 02:53:05.119]  And what?
[02:53:05.139 --> 02:53:07.442]  I mean, he was taking sight down the barrel right at his head?
[02:53:07.482 --> 02:53:07.802]  Yeah!
[02:53:07.982 --> 02:53:10.065]  Yeah, he was sighting in a gun in the back of his head.
[02:53:10.085 --> 02:53:12.087]  Did he smile or have an evil celebration?
[02:53:12.127 --> 02:53:14.710]  Was there any doubt an evil gang member twitched or anything?
[02:53:15.291 --> 02:53:16.332]  No, he just was...
[02:53:18.843 --> 02:53:24.504]  He just was over there looking at guns and decided there was a Cider man at the back of my friend's head.
[02:53:24.524 --> 02:53:30.346]  And then when you went outside you saw his quote neighborhood 1991, you said what type of truck?
[02:53:30.846 --> 02:53:32.086]  It's a Ford Extended Cab 1991.
[02:53:32.186 --> 02:53:35.547]  Okay listen, I'm gonna have Aaron Dykes call you right now, okay?
[02:53:36.207 --> 02:53:39.048]  I'm gonna put you on hold, I gotta go.
[02:53:39.328 --> 02:53:42.209]  I got loaded phone lines here, Jonathan, Leon, Carl, a bunch of others.
[02:53:42.689 --> 02:53:44.089]  Mike Rivera, what do you think of that story?
[02:53:45.308 --> 02:53:53.970]  Well, it does strike me as a reminder, and I say this because I've got relatives who work in law enforcement, and frankly it scares me that they're out there with a loaded gun.
[02:53:55.070 --> 02:54:09.034]  Police forces very often attract people who just really get off on the badge and the authority and the gun, and not everybody is there for really noble motives like you see in the movies and TV.
[02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:24.760]  And as a result, you do get a lot of abusive police behavior, and you get a lot of people who basically build their self-worth on their willingness to go along with any orders that they're given, regardless of how obscene they may be, as we saw in Waco, Texas.
[02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:31.464]  And it does, unfortunately, it leads to the, it supports the creation of the police state when you have a police force.
[02:54:31.866 --> 02:54:34.107]  That is just enjoying the power and authority.
[02:54:34.407 --> 02:54:40.568]  And I think back to this movie called Blade Runner, we're right in the middle of it when... You're not cops, you're little people!
[02:54:40.948 --> 02:54:42.709]  That's exactly the quote I was going for.
[02:54:42.729 --> 02:54:55.412]  So, uh, and that's really very much seen in a lot of our inner cities, that there's the, the cops really are overlords and overseers of the population and they're, they act that way and they're, they're treated that way.
[02:54:56.333 --> 02:55:00.976]  And, uh, you know, you get... This is the United States, and we're not going to put up with it.
[02:55:00.996 --> 02:55:01.656]  We've had enough.
[02:55:03.197 --> 02:55:03.897]  Well, I like that.
[02:55:04.017 --> 02:55:06.379]  I like that sentiment, and I like to see it happen.
[02:55:06.419 --> 02:55:21.387]  And again, part of what is working against that is that alternative media, such as your radio show, is exposing this kind of behavior by the police so that the public begins to realize that the guys in that black and white patrol car aren't real angels like is shown on TV.
[02:55:21.407 --> 02:55:25.469]  That, in fact, the TV and film portrayal of police is part of the propaganda.
[02:55:25.871 --> 02:55:28.077]  To make you just go along with whatever they're saying.
[02:55:31.806 --> 02:55:35.609]  The former senator that we saw on the radio saying there's going to be a new terror attack.
[02:55:35.889 --> 02:55:50.341]  He's out in Hollywood right now trying to pitch a film project in which Iranians and Islams are the bad guys and we've got to do this horrendous big-budget movie about what evil, vile people they are and how they threaten our way of life and what we're going to do about it.
[02:55:50.361 --> 02:55:50.961]  He knows full well.
[02:55:51.001 --> 02:55:52.703]  He'll probably find a very receptive audience.
[02:55:52.883 --> 02:55:53.303]  I hear you.
[02:55:53.343 --> 02:55:56.726]  Mike Rivero, you've got a Saturday program right here on GCN.
[02:55:56.766 --> 02:55:57.667]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:55:58.402 --> 02:55:58.782]  Thank you.
[02:55:59.223 --> 02:55:59.783]  Good to have you on.
[02:55:59.823 --> 02:56:02.705]  I'm sorry to Jonathan, Leon, Carl, everybody.
[02:56:02.965 --> 02:56:04.166]  We're going to have an open phone day.

[02:56:07.208 --> 02:56:08.569]  A lot of news I didn't get to.
[02:56:08.609 --> 02:56:09.270]  A lot we did.
[02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:13.012]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.

[02:56:19.817 --> 02:56:20.678]  That's tomorrow.
[02:56:21.118 --> 02:56:21.939]  God bless you all.
