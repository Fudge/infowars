[00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.385]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:44.455]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:45.917]  You want answers?
[00:00:46.678 --> 00:00:47.578]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.963]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:56.507]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:06.626]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.047]  Welcome.
[00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:11.677]  Thank you so much for joining us for this live Tuesday, the 6th day of February 2007.
[00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:18.313]  His once-a-month visit is coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:42.408]  Fellow GCN host and the head honcho over at WhatReallyHappened.com, Michael Rivera will be joining us to give us his overview on the world, what's happening domestically and internationally, the intensifying war drums for an attack on Iran, bird flu pandemic, fear-mongering, heating up yet again and much more with Michael Rivera.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.387]  Then, in that same hour, we have Mr. Watada, who's being court-martialed.
[00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:55.372]  We have his father joining us, and those charges are going ahead right now.
[00:01:55.452 --> 00:02:02.499]  The trial is about to start, and we'll have him pop in and give us an update during the second hour on that as well.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.601]  Then, in the third hour, we've got Nancy Kornke joining us.
[00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:20.364]  It's been many years since I had Nancy on, and one of the founders and one of the heads of the Michigan Militia, well-known to everyone across the country, is Mark from Michigan.
[00:02:21.644 --> 00:02:26.125]  He's getting out of prison here very soon, on trumped-up charges.
[00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:29.766]  In fact, I even have the squad car video of it we aired years ago.
[00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:38.531]  Look around for it last night, but the point is I have the squad car video where the police run him off the road and then claim that he assaulted them.
[00:02:39.052 --> 00:02:45.276]  They just drive right up, they run him off the road, then they charge him with assaulting them with the automobile.
[00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:47.317]  I mean, clear cut.
[00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:48.631]  Yes, we are.
[00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.674]  In the meantime, we're going to have wide open phones in this first hour.
[00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:15.016]  I'm going to take a lot of your calls.
[00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:17.078]  We're going to go straight to your calls in the next segment.
[00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.900]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.980]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.003]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:34.755]  ACLU alarmed that U.S.
[00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:40.777]  government may begin collecting DNA of all suspects, even if innocent.
[00:03:42.697 --> 00:03:43.338]  That's right.
[00:03:43.538 --> 00:03:45.658]  We've been telling you they've been planning that for a long time.
[00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.400]  They've already started it in England, and now it's coming here.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.280]  We'll break it down.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.622]  Also, why are Mexican congressmen from Mexico allowed to negotiate U.S.
[00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:59.603]  immigration policy in Washington, D.C.? ?
[00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.354]  This is from V. Dare and Alan Wall.
[00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:03.317]  We'll break that down.
[00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:06.286]  Also a great report here by Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[00:04:07.071 --> 00:04:12.274]  From his website, presidential frontrunners would surrender America's borders.
[00:04:13.034 --> 00:04:19.677]  Giuliani has entered the race, clearly involved, at least in the cover-up of 9-11, the inside job.
[00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:22.939]  What a monster, what a compromised individual.
[00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.680]  We'll talk about him as well.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.443]  New Fort Detrick Biodefense Laboratory, part of Bush's overall germ warfare operations.
[00:04:32.263 --> 00:04:33.044]  We'll go through that.
[00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:37.286]  Senate Republicans have successfully blocked debate on Iraq resolution.
[00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:40.908]  The war will just go on basically forever for all intents and purposes.
[00:04:41.268 --> 00:04:46.430]  A great article written by Paul Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:51.353]  No law to mandate dangerous untested HPV vaccine.
[00:04:52.222 --> 00:04:55.284]  We'll go back over this monumental hoax that had people up in arms.
[00:04:55.344 --> 00:04:57.906]  Folks are really getting angry in Texas and nationwide.
[00:04:58.366 --> 00:05:01.549]  Armed US police could be on London streets.
[00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:02.589]  London Telegraph.
[00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:04.210]  Talk about internationalism.
[00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:09.194]  Bird flu, pandemic and profiteering, quarantine USA.
[00:05:09.774 --> 00:05:13.957]  Space shuttle astronaut arrested at OIA on kidnapping attempt.
[00:05:14.318 --> 00:05:14.498]  Ha!
[00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:16.619]  And much more.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.021]  It's all coming up today.
[00:05:20.046 --> 00:05:23.931]  Strap yourselves in as the information war intensifies.
[00:05:24.412 --> 00:05:27.756]  You don't want to miss the next two hours and 55 minutes.
[00:05:28.477 --> 00:05:29.137]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.325]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:52.392]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:53.058 --> 00:06:00.120]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:00.521 --> 00:06:11.924]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:15.786]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:18.147]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:18.487 --> 00:06:22.328]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:35.952 --> 00:06:39.514]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:06:39.554 --> 00:06:40.074]  are located?
[00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:43.676]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:48.598]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:06:56.082 --> 00:07:00.165]  The safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.

[00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:25.866]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:27.990]  To order on the web or at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:37.426 --> 00:07:41.551]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:41.771 --> 00:07:43.533]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:50.080]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:56.507]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.609]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:07:58.729 --> 00:07:59.289]  I think so.
[00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:24.598]  Alright, again, Michael Rivera with his monthly visit joins us also.
[00:08:52.242 --> 00:09:00.328]  We have the father of the military officer who's being court-martialed for refusing to go be part of a criminal war, Mr. Wanta joining us.
[00:09:01.349 --> 00:09:05.512]  And then we have Nancy Kornke popping in as well to talk about Mark Kornke's soon-to-get-out-of-prison.
[00:09:06.172 --> 00:09:08.374]  We'll tell you about that whole sordid story and more.
[00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:15.939]  We do have the Senate Republicans, quote, successfully blocked debate on the Iraq Resolution.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.242]  Now, you have a Democratic majority in the House and the Senate.
[00:09:19.782 --> 00:09:21.103]  You have a Democratic majority
[00:09:22.314 --> 00:09:50.729]  uh... that could overpower anything bush wanted to do but it doesn't matter they're all for the war too we've got hillary we've got morocco obama uh... we've got all of them out saying they want to attack iran i mean it's not enough that were in iraq they want to attack iran and you know hillary says that you know if she would have known what was going to happen in iraq she wouldn't have voted for it that is nothing but politicking to neutralize her liberal base
[00:09:51.972 --> 00:09:57.077]  This is the same lady that swore she'd never run for president in 2000, 2002, and 2003, 4, 5, 6, and now she announces for president.
[00:10:01.972 --> 00:10:02.873]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:10:03.273 --> 00:10:06.516]  You know, the media constantly stacks the players up against each other.
[00:10:06.816 --> 00:10:08.838]  The Democratic candidates versus the Republican.
[00:10:09.078 --> 00:10:10.559]  The Republicans versus each other.
[00:10:10.599 --> 00:10:12.421]  The Democrats versus each other.
[00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:13.722]  It means nothing.
[00:10:13.882 --> 00:10:24.731]  Anyone they're pushing and giving attention from Newt Gingrich and Rudolph Giuliani on the Republican side and John McCain on the bridge between the two criminal groups
[00:10:26.008 --> 00:10:29.630]  Part of the Keating Five, Mr. Anti-Corruption as he's billed.
[00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:45.356]  Then you've got Hillary and Barack Obama and Edwards and the rest of them swirling around, all pushing socialized health care, open borders, gun control, the exact same stealth agenda that George W. Bush has been pushing.
[00:10:45.496 --> 00:10:46.837]  It doesn't matter.
[00:10:47.177 --> 00:10:50.598]  Notice they don't give any attention to somebody like Alan Keyes when he runs.
[00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:54.680]  Notice they don't give any attention
[00:10:55.387 --> 00:11:00.369]  To somebody like Ron Paul when he runs.
[00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:08.893]  I mean, even if they're still somewhat establishment, it doesn't matter.
[00:11:08.933 --> 00:11:14.656]  They still completely ignore them if they're not thoroughbred, global controlled.
[00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:16.617]  And I know the listeners understand this.
[00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:22.290]  It's just time to start focusing more in on local elections where we can still have an effect.
[00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:30.255]  It's important to continue to discredit the electronic government-controlled touchscreen and electronic voting machine systems which is now happening.
[00:11:30.695 --> 00:11:34.817]  States coast-to-coast are moving to pull them out or to block federal funding.
[00:11:34.857 --> 00:11:38.759]  The feds quote we're going to give everybody free funding with the Help America Vote Act.
[00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:50.542]  What, of 2002, which spent over six billion dollars giving these machines from three major companies to counties and cities and states all across the land.
[00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:55.628]  We've now got, what, nine states pulling out of the National ID Card.
[00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:58.871]  We've got a lot of good things happening.
[00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:21.307]  We've got Governor Perry in retreat now with members of his own party, prominent Republicans in the state of Texas, saying this is insane, it's a live, unproven virus, cancer virus, they want to give girls when it's one of the rarest forms of STDs, but it doesn't stop them from getting on the news, Perry and all his minions saying it's the most common.
[00:12:23.167 --> 00:12:25.848]  I went and looked it up, it's way down the list!
[00:12:26.928 --> 00:12:27.929]  They're liars!
[00:12:28.089 --> 00:12:29.109]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:32.322]  So we'll go over that.
[00:12:32.662 --> 00:12:34.244]  There's just so much news here today.
[00:12:34.264 --> 00:12:35.965]  ACLU alarms that U.S.
[00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:39.448]  government may begin collecting DNA of all suspects, even if innocent.
[00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:44.292]  Why are Mexican congressmen allowed to negotiate U.S.
[00:12:44.312 --> 00:12:46.774]  immigration policy in Washington, D.C.?
[00:12:47.234 --> 00:13:00.125]  I'll tell you what, let's get into this news first, then we'll go to Johnny, Ken, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:13:01.983 --> 00:13:03.844]  ACLU alarmed that U.S.
[00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:07.025]  government may begin collecting DNA of all suspects, even of innocent.
[00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:16.408]  And the ACLU's got a lot of good members, but the leadership is there to lose cases, create bad precedents, pose as our saviors, and really their loyal opposition.
[00:13:16.888 --> 00:13:17.788]  There's no doubting it.
[00:13:18.888 --> 00:13:23.270]  They also go out and defend rights that don't even exist, while not even defending basic rights.
[00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.571]  So they always put them out there as our savior.
[00:13:28.248 --> 00:13:32.150]  But when Democrats are in there butchering the Bill of Rights wholesale, they just love it.
[00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.111]  The American Civil Liberties Union is expressing its alarm that the U.S.
[00:13:36.152 --> 00:13:40.233]  government may begin collecting the DNA of all suspects, even if innocent.
[00:13:40.734 --> 00:13:50.858]  In a press release, the ACLU criticized the Justice Department's move to collect DNA samples of individuals who are arrested or detained by federal authorities, even if they are not convicted or charged with a crime.
[00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:57.781]  See, they've tried to pass federal laws to do this, but it's so draconian and so corrupt, they've failed.
[00:13:58.422 --> 00:13:59.904]  Clinton tried it, Bush has tried it.
[00:14:00.244 --> 00:14:01.946]  They've been trying it now for about nine years.
[00:14:02.666 --> 00:14:04.368]  Three years of Clinton, six years of Bush.
[00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:06.730]  And so what does Alberto Gonzales do?
[00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.771]  He just says, you know what?
[00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:10.274]  It's not even an executive order.
[00:14:10.334 --> 00:14:20.664]  He'll just, as the Justice Department's chief, as the Attorney General, he'll just say that this is, he'll just order federal agents and federal bureaucrats to do this.
[00:14:22.472 --> 00:14:23.373]  The same thing with Perry.
[00:14:23.853 --> 00:14:30.056]  They admit on the news and in press conferences, in fact he's live at a press conference right now at the Statehouse, down at the Capitol.
[00:14:32.483 --> 00:14:38.886]  Well, we couldn't get it passed as a law to put it on the list of mandatory vaccines, which is a lie itself.
[00:14:38.906 --> 00:14:42.488]  It's lies within lies within lies, like Russian dolls.
[00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:49.412]  You ever seen those, where there's a little bitty doll, and a bigger one goes over it, and a larger one, and an even larger one, and you've got like 20 of them inside each other?
[00:14:49.752 --> 00:14:57.055]  It's lies within lies within lies within lies, with propaganda and semantical deceptions and twisting.
[00:14:57.075 --> 00:15:00.637]  I mean, it's almost unnavigable.
[00:15:00.837 --> 00:15:02.138]  You just know the whole thing's a lie.
[00:15:04.648 --> 00:15:08.091]  And it's the same thing with the cancer vaccine, which is live cancer.
[00:15:09.813 --> 00:15:14.057]  He says, well, we can't get it passed, so I'm just signing an executive order, and it's the law, you gotta take it.
[00:15:14.537 --> 00:15:27.650]  And you go read the executive order, and it says, oh, I'm just telling the State Department that this is on the list of recommended, but then the Health Department, the schools, go out and lie, like they do with the 40-something other vaccines, and say, it's the law, you gotta take it!
[00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:31.300]  So we're seeing the hoax here.
[00:15:31.661 --> 00:15:33.142]  And everybody's real mad now.
[00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.584]  The liberal shows, the conservative shows, all the local shows.
[00:15:35.824 --> 00:15:36.805]  I hear national shows.
[00:15:36.865 --> 00:15:38.486]  I monitor them and scan through the dial.
[00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:40.428]  They're going, he's gone too far.
[00:15:40.488 --> 00:15:43.070]  Yeah, this is crazy to make somebody do something.
[00:15:43.591 --> 00:15:46.193]  To have a law, you've got to take this thing.
[00:15:46.573 --> 00:15:48.855]  Why there's medical problems associated with it.
[00:15:51.558 --> 00:15:55.861]  Again, even those that are quote, fighting it, are effectively still putting out the hoax.
[00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:57.883]  That there is a law, you've got to take it.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:25.076]  And they're not effectively attacking the fact, this used to be added by the way to our article we wrote for Prison Planet, that they say in a Fox News piece and in the Associated Press and other places, that this is the second most common, and then in another newscast, the spokespersons for Merck, the paid politicians, including Perry's former Chief of Staff,
[00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:34.504]  State Senators and State Legislators who were openly on the payroll of Merck, some of them openly on boards of Merck, they say it's the most common STD.
[00:16:34.925 --> 00:16:40.346]  So we've got to give it to all of the girls.
[00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:45.667]  Folks, I went and looked at the local Austin Health Department.
[00:16:45.708 --> 00:16:48.068]  I went and looked at the federal health sheet.
[00:16:48.128 --> 00:16:49.188]  I went to the CDC.
[00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:54.470]  Cervical transmitted cancer
[00:16:56.196 --> 00:16:58.999]  Is way down the list.
[00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:01.701]  On some lists it's like 15, on others it's 21.
[00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:04.703]  I even printed off one of those lists.
[00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:12.390]  So when you see a headline like, Perry requires HPV vaccine for girls, it's a complete lie.
[00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.792]  And it's a lie that it's the most common, or the second most common.
[00:17:16.993 --> 00:17:20.076]  I hate to go over gross things like this on air, but you can go look at the list.
[00:17:20.516 --> 00:17:24.860]  It's herpes, it's general warts, and then it just moves down from there.
[00:17:25.876 --> 00:17:31.397]  And there are a bunch of names of stuff I've never heard of, and I'm pretty well-read on things like this.
[00:17:31.797 --> 00:17:33.978]  There's a bunch of stuff I don't even know what it is.
[00:17:34.858 --> 00:17:37.578]  All this wonderful new third world stuff spreading everywhere.
[00:17:38.439 --> 00:17:46.520]  And, uh, I mean, there's things people get that I don't even want to... Ugh, I mean, like bugs, actual insects.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.681]  I'm not talking about... Oh, this is too gross.
[00:17:49.721 --> 00:17:51.441]  I'm not just talking about mites, folks.
[00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:53.342]  I'm not just talking about crabs.
[00:17:53.422 --> 00:17:55.082]  I mean stuff that lives in you.
[00:17:56.315 --> 00:18:00.238]  Okay, worms, and it's all above this thing.
[00:18:01.338 --> 00:18:04.820]  Do they say a word about totally drug-resistant and drug-immune?
[00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:08.783]  TB spreading and killing tens of thousands a year in the U.S.?
[00:18:09.003 --> 00:18:11.865]  Do they talk about having three cases of leprosy before 2004?
[00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.987]  And then in 2005, they had 7,000-plus cases and opened a huge leper colony in East Texas?
[00:18:21.128 --> 00:18:21.689]  Oh, no!
[00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:23.170]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:31.737]  It's all... There's 9,710 cases of this last year, and of course a fraction of the people died.
[00:18:31.797 --> 00:18:32.917]  It's heavily treatable.
[00:18:33.358 --> 00:18:41.724]  Let's just give every girl in America a 360-something dollar shot, and then lie and tell her it's the law, tell their parents it's the law.
[00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:49.851]  And then one of the bigger lies is they keep implying it's only these backwards religious kooks that don't want to protect our girls.
[00:18:51.483 --> 00:18:54.744]  So the left all hears that and thinks, oh, I'm not a kooky religious nut!
[00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:58.546]  Of course, I believe those parents are sensible and smart.
[00:18:59.186 --> 00:19:00.647]  They know something other people don't know.
[00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:06.049]  But they're all making it a promiscuity issue of, well, 10 and 11 year olds don't need this.
[00:19:07.129 --> 00:19:10.171]  And the average age to contract it is 46.
[00:19:13.092 --> 00:19:20.995]  So they're making it all a debate about these backwards people don't want to protect girls when it's non-partisan.
[00:19:21.716 --> 00:19:25.297]  I mean, I heard two liberal talk shows this morning decrying it.
[00:19:26.178 --> 00:19:28.679]  I heard conservative shows decrying it yesterday.
[00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:36.201]  And they're saying it's because it's their bodies, it's the parents have control over their children, it's not the state.
[00:19:37.002 --> 00:19:39.643]  So there's so many facets to this.
[00:19:40.003 --> 00:19:45.225]  When we get back, we'll go directly to your calls, as promised, and later I'll get into all the other news.
[00:19:45.745 --> 00:19:50.607]  Johnny, Ken, Lucas, John, many others.

[00:19:54.139 --> 00:19:58.803]  It is Tuesday, the 6th day of February 2007.
[00:19:59.523 --> 00:20:01.925]  Already well into the second month of 2007.
[00:20:02.145 --> 00:20:02.765]  Hard to believe.
[00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:04.547]  Where did 05 go?
[00:20:04.847 --> 00:20:05.748]  Where did 06 go?
[00:20:05.768 --> 00:20:09.150]  Some days I wake up and think I'm in 2002 again.
[00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.872]  No, it's just life is speeding past us.
[00:20:12.332 --> 00:20:18.397]  And we have Orwellian Brave New World announcements of, you must take the live cancer virus!
[00:20:18.957 --> 00:20:24.602]  And the CDC and others come out and say, we're getting incredible bad reactions to this.
[00:20:25.282 --> 00:20:25.983]  Don't take it.
[00:20:26.203 --> 00:20:28.725]  The American Medical Association is saying don't take it.
[00:20:29.385 --> 00:20:31.007]  Does that stop Dr. Perry?
[00:20:31.047 --> 00:20:31.247]  No.
[00:20:37.623 --> 00:20:38.664]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:38.985 --> 00:20:41.768]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:42.028 --> 00:20:46.192]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:46.613 --> 00:20:47.454]  So what do you do?
[00:20:47.774 --> 00:20:52.339]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:54.940]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:21:35.652 --> 00:21:40.258]  Ted Anderson reminds us February 6 2007 gold 65640 ounce gold coins are 677.69 341.39 for half 168.37 for quarter ounce that's 677.69 341.39 168.37

[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.002]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[00:22:08.022 --> 00:22:11.004]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[00:22:11.224 --> 00:22:16.367]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[00:22:16.507 --> 00:22:17.768]  Could government let this happen?
[00:22:17.928 --> 00:22:19.869]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?

[00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:43.554]  Did you know that the United Nations Charter outlines a path to world tyranny?
[00:22:44.135 --> 00:22:49.822]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[00:22:50.362 --> 00:22:56.469]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?

[00:23:36.835 --> 00:23:38.877]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:48.446]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:56.094]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:56.804 --> 00:24:02.287]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:24:45.098 --> 00:24:50.562]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:24:50.602 --> 00:24:55.626]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[00:24:56.026 --> 00:24:58.508]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:24:58.728 --> 00:25:01.169]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:06.433]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:25:09.369 --> 00:25:30.898]  We looked down a river and we see'd the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drum They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring We stood beside our cotton fields and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[00:25:33.872 --> 00:25:36.473]  Old Hick Cree said we could take them by surprise.
[00:25:36.573 --> 00:25:39.215]  If we didn't fire muskies till we looked them in the eye.
[00:25:39.435 --> 00:25:41.916]  We held our fire till we see their faces well.
[00:25:41.956 --> 00:25:44.957]  Then we opened up our swirl guns and really gave them well.
[00:25:45.077 --> 00:25:48.359]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:25:48.379 --> 00:25:50.820]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.741]  We fired once more and they began to run it.
[00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:55.822]  From down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:25:58.864 --> 00:26:04.310]  Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles and they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
[00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.413]  They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them.
[00:26:07.433 --> 00:26:09.355]  Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:26:15.237 --> 00:26:16.457]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:26:16.477 --> 00:26:18.138]  Let's start going to your crawls now.
[00:26:18.158 --> 00:26:21.039]  Let's go ahead and talk to Johnny in Hawaii.
[00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.239]  Johnny, thank you for holding.
[00:26:22.339 --> 00:26:23.379]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:26.660]  I want to give you some information on this human papillomavirus.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.001]  First of all, I work for a hospital in Hawaii.
[00:26:43.445 --> 00:26:46.007]  And I'm in the department of OBGYN.
[00:26:47.087 --> 00:26:59.974]  What we have here with this vaccine is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have gotten together with the pharmaceutical companies to create this whole condition with this vaccine.
[00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:05.418]  And I have a report on their opinion about the virus itself.
[00:27:05.438 --> 00:27:06.598]  A few little facts.
[00:27:06.638 --> 00:27:10.460]  First of all, they want to immunize females between 9 and 26 years old.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.820]  Yeah, that's why I've been saying 9.
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:14.801]  Perry says 11 and 12.
[00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:16.921]  The actual recommendation is 9.
[00:27:18.062 --> 00:27:21.302]  And they're also doing research to have this given to males.
[00:27:22.163 --> 00:27:22.243]  Yes.
[00:27:22.263 --> 00:27:23.563]  In addition to the females.
[00:27:24.884 --> 00:27:27.304]  The Pediatric Association is totally against this.
[00:27:28.284 --> 00:27:33.386]  Well, I know the American Medical Association is saying you shouldn't take it, but I know that subgroups that have been paid off are.
[00:27:34.166 --> 00:27:38.347]  Yeah, well, pediatrics committees say that it's not good.
[00:27:38.427 --> 00:27:39.608]  It's not going to be good for the children.
[00:27:39.628 --> 00:27:40.448]  It hasn't been proven.
[00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:42.392]  You know, just a whole number of things.
[00:27:42.613 --> 00:27:46.754]  And they've already given it to tens of thousands and it's causing massive health problems.
[00:27:47.074 --> 00:27:47.334]  Yes.
[00:27:48.155 --> 00:28:01.199]  And the problem with this virus is that in the report it says that the majority of the people that have this are girls in the low-income families that are underprivileged.
[00:28:01.219 --> 00:28:02.760]  So what does that mean?
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.980]  Illegally aliens, mostly.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.121]  That's exactly what it boils down to.
[00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:08.542]  Plus a couple other things.
[00:28:09.474 --> 00:28:12.936]  The whole pharmaceutical industry is a rip-off.
[00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:17.138]  They create diseases and provide drugs for them.
[00:28:17.318 --> 00:28:25.822]  These 2005 figures is the money they spend on consumers, advertising their drugs to consumers.
[00:28:26.282 --> 00:28:26.822]  $4.2 billion.
[00:28:27.083 --> 00:28:29.124]  And they do the same thing with doctors.
[00:28:29.224 --> 00:28:33.446]  They paid $7.2 billion to 2005 to promote their drugs.
[00:28:33.746 --> 00:28:34.346]  Oh, I know!
[00:28:34.426 --> 00:28:37.708]  Listen, my dad doesn't do it, but they offer him cruises, trips,
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.220]  Money.
[00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:41.763]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[00:28:41.943 --> 00:28:49.371]  Yeah, it's just an old boy network, and it's like a big country club between the drug companies and the doctors.
[00:28:49.391 --> 00:28:51.813]  Well, my numbers are a lot higher than 4 billion.
[00:28:52.013 --> 00:28:53.675]  That's probably just TV advertising.
[00:28:53.735 --> 00:28:56.318]  Well, this was 2005 figures, too.
[00:28:56.358 --> 00:28:59.141]  My gosh, the nightly news, half the ads are drug ads.
[00:28:59.321 --> 00:28:59.982]  Exactly, yeah.
[00:29:00.822 --> 00:29:02.365]  That's all this is with Perry is a huge PR stunt.
[00:29:02.385 --> 00:29:03.066]  That's all he's doing.
[00:29:15.385 --> 00:29:18.808]  You know, the slogan of these vaccines is one less.
[00:29:18.908 --> 00:29:21.950]  And yeah, one less person that isn't infected.
[00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:24.592]  I mean, this is a live virus, folks.
[00:29:25.353 --> 00:29:27.755]  And they've got all these other vaccines they want to make us take.
[00:29:27.815 --> 00:29:30.517]  Have you read about the vaccines that, quote, cure you of cigarette smoking?
[00:29:30.937 --> 00:29:37.703]  And also narcotics, because it attacks the brain and creates plaques, destroying those receptors?
[00:29:38.306 --> 00:29:39.286]  Yeah, you're destroying your brain.
[00:29:39.346 --> 00:29:40.807]  Doesn't that sound wonderful?
[00:29:40.967 --> 00:29:42.608]  A live virus that attacks your brain.
[00:29:42.648 --> 00:29:43.488]  Boy, give me some!
[00:29:43.888 --> 00:29:52.052]  But Merck is in the position to profit billions and billions of dollars, so they want to take this worldwide, not just in the United States.
[00:29:52.072 --> 00:29:56.914]  But domestically it'll be tens of billions if a majority of the girls and women take this.
[00:29:57.234 --> 00:29:57.694]  Exactly.
[00:29:57.774 --> 00:30:00.615]  It's $300 plus dollars per shot.
[00:30:02.456 --> 00:30:03.177]  Thanks again, Alex.
[00:30:03.677 --> 00:30:06.398]  Anything else you want to add working in and around this?
[00:30:07.771 --> 00:30:12.052]  Well, just, uh, you should try some sort of alternative, uh, medicine.
[00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:15.032]  Uh, anyways, some holistic approach.
[00:30:15.232 --> 00:30:20.293]  But a pap smear is all a woman needs yearly to see if there's any beginning of cancer anyway.
[00:30:20.473 --> 00:30:21.894]  And they can be treated very easily.
[00:30:22.394 --> 00:30:22.894]  Absolutely.
[00:30:22.914 --> 00:30:24.034]  In fact, I'll just... Well, stay there.
[00:30:24.054 --> 00:30:25.254]  I want to hear what they medically do.
[00:30:26.235 --> 00:30:27.175]  We're on the march.
[00:30:27.635 --> 00:30:29.255]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:30.155 --> 00:30:32.836]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:36.425 --> 00:30:40.387]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:30:40.607 --> 00:30:44.149]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:30:44.429 --> 00:30:48.511]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:30:48.811 --> 00:30:49.751]  I was so amazed.
[00:30:49.972 --> 00:30:52.833]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[00:30:53.013 --> 00:30:54.834]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:30:55.254 --> 00:31:00.519]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:31:00.939 --> 00:31:06.864]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[00:31:07.125 --> 00:31:08.846]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:31:09.106 --> 00:31:12.289]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:31:12.489 --> 00:31:16.393]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:31:16.673 --> 00:31:18.094]  Plus, the service was great.

[00:32:36.957 --> 00:32:38.117]  Hey Jane, how's it going?
[00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:40.418]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[00:32:40.618 --> 00:32:44.579]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.800]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.121]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again.
[00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:54.482]  If there was only something natural I could take that would help control my blood sugar that really works.
[00:32:54.763 --> 00:32:56.123]  Have you tried sucroblast?

[00:33:25.214 --> 00:33:26.395]  So Jane, what do you think?
[00:33:26.655 --> 00:33:30.478]  I'm going to call Sucroblast to set up a free consultation right now!
[00:33:30.839 --> 00:33:31.619]  Excellent, Jane.
[00:33:31.699 --> 00:33:32.860]  He'll be glad you did.
[00:33:48.422 --> 00:33:58.927]  From what I've read about this cancer-causing virus and the infection it causes is that if it doesn't get into late stages and spread into other tissues, that basically it's just scraped off.
[00:34:00.508 --> 00:34:02.909]  And that it's very easy to deal with.
[00:34:03.809 --> 00:34:09.112]  But we're talking to Johnny in Hawaii who works at a hospital in this field.
[00:34:09.572 --> 00:34:15.815]  Fill us in, Johnny, on how common this cancer is and how it's dealt with.
[00:34:17.335 --> 00:34:33.140]  Well if a woman gets a pap smear and it shows any cancer they can go through various treatments from just very minor surgery to depending on if it has a mysticized or being spread through the body or go through our oncology department
[00:34:33.857 --> 00:34:37.800]  And go through the chemotherapy and whatever else you want to use.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:51.630]  But Texas is the second most populous state with 27 plus million people and only what 412 people died last year from this and most of them I was reading were drug addicts, prostitutes, had compromised immune systems.
[00:34:52.451 --> 00:34:54.232]  On average again we're in their late 40s.
[00:34:55.093 --> 00:35:01.357]  And so 400 in a state of 27 million that is literally just microscopic.
[00:35:01.718 --> 00:35:02.138]  That's right.
[00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:07.353]  Well, the immune system, if it's weak, you're more susceptible to cancer.
[00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:17.300]  So if you keep your immune system strong with a high dose of vitamin C, the right kinds of food, you're not drinking, you're not smoking, you're not doing drugs, you'll be pretty much okay.
[00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:26.026]  But people that don't do that, they have a chance of getting it, but it's certainly not one of the top cancers.
[00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:28.549]  It's very prevalent.
[00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:37.715]  Breast cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer is what's killing women and they get on the news and say, nope, this is the number one cancer and the number one STD for women.
[00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.016]  Total lie!
[00:35:39.316 --> 00:35:40.277]  Oh, I forgot that lie.
[00:35:40.797 --> 00:35:42.479]  It's not just that it's the number one STD.
[00:35:42.539 --> 00:35:43.159]  Total lie.
[00:35:43.199 --> 00:35:43.880]  Way down the list.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.681]  They also say it's the number one cancer.
[00:35:46.661 --> 00:35:52.926]  Well, this opinion I'm looking at from the ACOG, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists,
[00:35:53.752 --> 00:36:09.599]  It says there's a hundred types of HPV virus, and there's 15 associated with cervical cancer, and out of that 15, there's only like four that have like a 9% possibility of even causing cancer.
[00:36:10.679 --> 00:36:21.464]  But there again, if a woman gets her yearly checkup, you know, and you mentioned that scraping process, so that's a common procedure to remove the inner liner of the uterus
[00:36:22.359 --> 00:36:23.240]  I don't know.
[00:36:41.269 --> 00:36:47.434]  No, let's give them a live cancer virus that's causing them to bleed out and have seizures and fall over dead.
[00:36:47.654 --> 00:36:49.695]  Let's give nine-year-old girls this.
[00:36:50.316 --> 00:36:58.922]  Also with this vaccine is cortisol, that they don't know how long it's going to last, and they're talking about updating the dosage periodically.
[00:36:59.242 --> 00:37:04.686]  And of course, you said really over a hundred of these viruses, so there's got to be lots more different variants, yes.
[00:37:06.407 --> 00:37:08.989]  And just like any other virus, this can
[00:37:09.984 --> 00:37:13.765]  I'm not sure how many it is, but they have a requirement
[00:37:40.197 --> 00:37:43.880]  If people don't know any better, let your kids get this MMR shot, you know?
[00:37:44.561 --> 00:37:45.662]  Measles, mumps, rubella.
[00:37:46.603 --> 00:37:52.468]  And they have to be... Now there's five or six triple and quad injections that they're giving.
[00:37:52.508 --> 00:37:54.970]  If you add them all up, it's over 40 in the average state.
[00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.631]  Thank you so much for your time, sir.
[00:37:56.651 --> 00:37:57.372]  I appreciate that.
[00:37:57.592 --> 00:37:58.072]  Oh, thanks Alex.
[00:37:58.113 --> 00:38:04.598]  Let me just finally ask you, the other health care providers where you work at that hospital, what's their view on this controversy?
[00:38:05.679 --> 00:38:07.401]  Well, they just found out about
[00:38:08.806 --> 00:38:13.248]  The ruling there in Texas, and I'm not sure what their opinion is yet.
[00:38:13.288 --> 00:38:17.191]  I'm sure some of them aren't going to like it very much.
[00:38:17.471 --> 00:38:21.133]  You mean the imperial pontification of the governor?
[00:38:21.973 --> 00:38:22.273]  Yeah.
[00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:23.294]  It's no ruling.
[00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:23.994]  It's no law.
[00:38:24.014 --> 00:38:28.176]  It's just an executive order recommending this be part of the recommended vaccines, and they hoax.
[00:38:28.196 --> 00:38:30.958]  I'm going to keep making this clear and lie and say it's the law.
[00:38:31.218 --> 00:38:31.999]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:33.139]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:38:33.299 --> 00:38:33.940]  Thank you, Johnny.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.060]  Ken in New York.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.041]  We're going to have to hurry up now.
[00:38:36.301 --> 00:38:36.861]  Go ahead, Ken.
[00:38:37.221 --> 00:38:37.802]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:38:39.446 --> 00:39:04.200]  I don't know if you saw it or if you were told about it, but last week, I think it was Tuesday night, on the O'Reilly factor, Congressman Charles Rangel was interviewed and O'Reilly was all hot and bothered over the anti-war demonstrations a couple of weeks ago and that some of the people were calling for Bush's impeachment and he was all foaming at the mouth almost at Rangel saying that
[00:39:05.595 --> 00:39:09.559]  How can you guys consider impeaching Mr. Bush when he has all these things on his mind?
[00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:11.241]  He's fighting terrorism and all this.
[00:39:12.182 --> 00:39:16.788]  And it's no surprise I guess, but Rangel said something like, well don't worry because it's not going to happen.
[00:39:16.808 --> 00:39:19.171]  And I was kind of surprised that he
[00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:23.491]  We're so blatant, you know, that we have no intentions of impeaching Bush.
[00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:30.576]  Well, Rupert Murdoch last week was at the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland with all the globalists, and I've got the transcript here.
[00:39:30.636 --> 00:39:43.885]  He openly said in front of international TV and print publications, he just openly said that they do try to influence public opinion and they are pro-war, but that they've, quote, failed to convince the public.
[00:39:44.965 --> 00:39:55.211]  I mean, you've got Fox News watchers and CNN is just as bad, it's a different flavor of propaganda, who will argue with you and say it's fair and balanced, it's not propaganda, when the owner of it says it's propaganda.
[00:39:56.512 --> 00:39:57.692]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:39:58.373 --> 00:40:03.195]  But it's like Perry lying and saying that this is the number one cancer for women.
[00:40:04.596 --> 00:40:09.379]  And also, a couple of things, this guy I know told me that around Christmas time, last Christmas,
[00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:18.954]  He went to a large mall north of New York City about an hour north, well-known mall, and he went into a Suncoast video store to get TerraStorm.
[00:40:20.114 --> 00:40:26.677]  So the manager was behind the counter, he asked him for it, he says, uh, we don't have that, um, maybe I can order it for you.
[00:40:27.097 --> 00:40:34.980]  So he went to the computer and he punched it in, and this guy told me that a strange look came across his face.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.141]  He couldn't really describe it, but
[00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:42.460]  It was a reaction to whatever came up on the computer screen when he punched Terror Storm in the search.
[00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:51.603]  And yes, this guy, I could get that for you if you give me your contact information, your name and address and phone number, I'll get back to you.
[00:40:52.743 --> 00:41:04.006]  Now, I don't know whether some kind of red flag came up on the computer screen when he punched Terror Storm in, or have you heard anything from other people who have requested that in any kind of major video chain?
[00:41:05.606 --> 00:41:08.007]  Something negative has come up on the computer screen?
[00:41:08.727 --> 00:41:09.007]  Sure.
[00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:13.228]  Let me just, and I appreciate your call, let me comment on that.
[00:41:13.988 --> 00:41:17.088]  I happen to know exactly how the supply chain works.
[00:41:18.089 --> 00:41:27.731]  I happen to have, most people are fans of the broadcast at Barnes & Noble and other bookstores around Austin, so I've been able to get around and look at the computer screen.
[00:41:28.251 --> 00:41:33.012]  And a lot of these bookstores, they have the computer screen right up in front of you at kiosks, and they'll punch it in and say,
[00:41:34.483 --> 00:41:50.213]  And a lot of times, you know, they'll do that type of quizzling look when it shows that they have it, but then it's not available, or they show that they do have some in the store, but then he doesn't have it in his main list.
[00:41:50.333 --> 00:41:59.259]  So, just because somebody gives you a look, I mean, when I go into the store to get some naval history book, or to get some book on
[00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:09.356]  petrochemical industry, or I go in to get some fiction book for my wife she wants, you know, they'll give you a look and then ask for your info and they call you when it comes in.
[00:42:09.916 --> 00:42:10.957]  That's how they do it.
[00:42:11.017 --> 00:42:14.039]  They say, give me your name and number and we'll call you when it comes.
[00:42:14.119 --> 00:42:16.601]  That is standard operating procedure.
[00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:24.406]  And we have to be careful to not let the intimidation in America and the chilling effect get us to, you know, run at shadows.
[00:42:25.527 --> 00:42:27.248]  Now, has there been
[00:42:28.226 --> 00:42:30.387]  Blocking of terror storm in stores.
[00:42:30.527 --> 00:42:32.427]  Yes, that's way up the corporate chain.
[00:42:32.848 --> 00:42:38.509]  That's not some local thing, and they don't, you know, from my knowledge, have some notes saying, get this person.
[00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:42.951]  No, that's people superimposing fear on their own minds.
[00:42:43.531 --> 00:42:47.752]  What happens is, say Barnes and Nobles, or Borders, buys thousands of them.
[00:42:48.692 --> 00:42:56.635]  And then people all over the country go into stores, and they say, well, we're supposed to have it, but it never was shipped to us from the distribution center.
[00:42:57.407 --> 00:42:58.748]  Or, yeah, we had three copies.
[00:42:58.788 --> 00:42:59.748]  They all sold out.
[00:43:00.708 --> 00:43:03.129]  Or, yeah, we've got two copies, but they're in the back.
[00:43:03.169 --> 00:43:03.889]  Let me go get them.
[00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:14.533]  And it's strange, because my distributor, which is a large national distributor, they put out Outfoxed and a lot of Robert Greenwald big films.
[00:43:14.613 --> 00:43:19.615]  And, you know, they published the book that got turned into the movie Siriana with the CIA agent Robert Baer.
[00:43:20.036 --> 00:43:21.576]  So, I mean, they're big time.
[00:43:22.256 --> 00:43:26.538]  And he said he's... Well, you've heard Gary Badley here on air, the owner of the company.
[00:43:27.725 --> 00:43:34.828]  He said he's never seen such a blockage out there, because it was taken off in the stores.
[00:43:35.308 --> 00:43:37.950]  Now, a lot of the independents, and there's thousands of those, they sold them.
[00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.150]  They carried them.
[00:43:41.131 --> 00:43:42.231]  There wasn't a problem.
[00:43:43.192 --> 00:43:51.235]  But the big chains, Gary Bagley basically gave TerraStorm for free to Barnes and Nobles, and that's how you do it.
[00:43:51.255 --> 00:43:54.997]  You give them a bunch of your product free, and then you get an end cap.
[00:43:55.848 --> 00:44:01.152]  And in the documentary film section, we were supposed to get an end cap, and no end caps went in.
[00:44:01.172 --> 00:44:07.857]  No one was... So basically, they gave it to Barnes & Nobles, and then Barnes & Nobles didn't honor the deal and didn't end cap it.
[00:44:08.238 --> 00:44:10.559]  And some Barnes & Nobles did indeed have it on shelves.
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.962]  Others couldn't get it delivered from their warehouse.
[00:44:15.163 --> 00:44:20.627]  Another thing that Amazon.com, they do have them in stock now, did, is they sold out in like a week.
[00:44:21.187 --> 00:44:24.530]  It went to number eight on their charts, which is amazing.
[00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:41.106]  And then, even for a week and a half, they had it in their warehouse, and Gary Badley knew their procedure, and once it shows in their warehouse, they have like five different ones in the country for, you know, to ship quickly, it was supposed to show that it was there.
[00:44:41.326 --> 00:44:47.788]  And this time they just, for like almost two weeks, didn't put it up on the website saying that it was available.
[00:44:49.029 --> 00:44:52.190]  Though people were still ordering it, and they were getting it like in two, three days.
[00:44:55.871 --> 00:45:00.335]  There is a effort, no doubt, but that's at the top.
[00:45:01.075 --> 00:45:02.036]  It's not at the bottom.
[00:45:03.697 --> 00:45:06.519]  There is an effort to block people getting TerrorStorm.
[00:45:06.559 --> 00:45:08.241]  You can always get it at Infowars.com.
[00:45:08.481 --> 00:45:09.402]  We'll ship it out to UPS.
[00:45:09.422 --> 00:45:11.163]  You can get America Freedom to Fascism.
[00:45:11.503 --> 00:45:12.864]  It's not available on Amazon.
[00:45:12.884 --> 00:45:13.725]  You can get it from us.
[00:45:14.926 --> 00:45:17.048]  We've got a bunch of other suppressed books and videos.
[00:45:17.108 --> 00:45:18.389]  That's why these are important.
[00:45:19.089 --> 00:45:21.731]  I mean, Big Brother wouldn't be trying to block these if it wasn't hurting them.
[00:45:21.991 --> 00:45:23.793]  You want pure censorship
[00:45:24.515 --> 00:45:24.955]  Google!
[00:45:25.295 --> 00:45:32.278]  Twice that we caught them, that we got screenshots, that we wrote articles about it, that we totally proved it.
[00:45:34.399 --> 00:45:43.223]  Now, it had clearly happened a couple times before that, because then we had to get phone calls and emails, and then we started watching and then we caught it.
[00:45:44.363 --> 00:45:52.867]  But we know a couple times at least before, TerrorStorm, when it first went on Google Video for free, went into the top 100 and was surging towards number one.
[00:45:53.713 --> 00:45:58.757]  And it would suddenly, you know, say have 600,000 views in two days, and boom!
[00:45:59.337 --> 00:45:59.897]  It'd be gone.
[00:46:00.198 --> 00:46:12.105]  It'd be zero views, the very same upload, same tag, and uploads we'd put up there, and it would be still there, but knocked down to like number 5,000 and totally off the list.
[00:46:12.186 --> 00:46:13.967]  And then it would build back up to 500,000.
[00:46:14.007 --> 00:46:14.207]  Boom!
[00:46:14.227 --> 00:46:14.867]  Erased it again.
[00:46:17.774 --> 00:46:24.438]  That happened several times when we were told, before we went and looked at it, and we started looking, and indeed it happened twice in front of us.
[00:46:25.219 --> 00:46:28.661]  Hundreds, if not thousands, I know a lot of you sent emails and called them.
[00:46:28.961 --> 00:46:33.404]  They put out a little press release, and we posted it saying, yes, it's an accident.
[00:46:33.804 --> 00:46:36.246]  We accidentally erased it's rank.
[00:46:36.746 --> 00:46:37.587]  And why is that important?
[00:46:37.607 --> 00:46:41.589]  We don't care about having something of, oh, we've been number one on Google Video.
[00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.352]  Which we briefly once were, before they knocked it out.
[00:46:46.204 --> 00:46:47.704]  It's not, oh, we got the trophy.
[00:46:48.565 --> 00:46:51.126]  You know, we got the Piston Cup, or we got the Heisman.
[00:46:51.806 --> 00:46:57.227]  It's that when you're in the top 100, that's where tens of millions a day go to do their TV watching.
[00:46:57.587 --> 00:47:00.168]  There's now more people watching video online than television.
[00:47:00.948 --> 00:47:04.489]  So they're trying to merge the two right now, the old line people in a desperate bid to keep control.
[00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.711]  And so by being up there in the top 100, you get seen.
[00:47:08.771 --> 00:47:12.052]  It's like being on tens of thousands of billboards in the country.
[00:47:12.432 --> 00:47:12.852]  Literally.
[00:47:13.838 --> 00:47:23.741]  And so once you get up there, they found out with Loose Change Second Edition, once you start getting to number one, you can stay there for months, and then tens and tens and tens of millions get to see it.
[00:47:24.381 --> 00:47:29.623]  But they haven't stopped us with the 50-something versions that are up there and watching their erasers and everything they've done.
[00:47:30.563 --> 00:47:35.685]  Conservatively, about 10 million people have now watched Terror Storm.
[00:47:35.785 --> 00:47:38.466]  Conservatively, just on Google Video.
[00:47:39.167 --> 00:47:43.630]  Then there's all the BitTorrents and the torrents and the downloads and the file sharing sites.
[00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:45.791]  But 10 million!
[00:47:45.831 --> 00:47:48.653]  We released that in late June.
[00:47:48.673 --> 00:47:51.274]  The last few days of June.
[00:47:52.655 --> 00:47:53.876]  And so how many months is that?
[00:47:54.076 --> 00:47:54.756]  6, 7, 8 months?
[00:47:55.857 --> 00:47:58.638]  10 million people in 8 months.
[00:48:00.579 --> 00:48:06.683]  I mean that is over a million people a month in one venue being able to see TerrorStorm.
[00:48:07.355 --> 00:48:12.139]  And I want to thank you, the listeners, for pushing it, telling people about it, blogging it, emailing it out.
[00:48:12.239 --> 00:48:12.960]  Just keep it going.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.221]  Keep it going.
[00:48:14.861 --> 00:48:16.262]  So, I feel good.
[00:48:16.422 --> 00:48:18.444]  You know, I made a film, put it out on DVD.
[00:48:18.524 --> 00:48:21.306]  If you want the high quality with the extras and the supporters, please get it.
[00:48:21.847 --> 00:48:24.749]  But, I mean, we day one said, here, boom, free.
[00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:27.431]  Because the goal here is to save this country.
[00:48:27.451 --> 00:48:29.353]  We're not going to have a future if we don't.
[00:48:30.353 --> 00:48:32.235]  Let's go ahead and talk to, who's up next year?
[00:48:34.148 --> 00:48:35.169]  Lucas in Texas.
[00:48:35.249 --> 00:48:35.949]  Thanks for holding.
[00:48:35.989 --> 00:48:36.409]  Go ahead.
[00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:37.429]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[00:48:37.449 --> 00:48:38.250]  This is Lucas.
[00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.851]  I ended up moving to Austin so I could be closer to the action here.
[00:48:43.252 --> 00:48:43.812]  Great town.
[00:48:43.872 --> 00:48:44.532]  I love Austin.
[00:48:44.913 --> 00:48:54.276]  Hey, what I wanted to mention is somebody had made a pretty smart announcement on the 9-11 blogger site about having a boycott.
[00:48:54.797 --> 00:48:59.679]  You had mentioned before about having the celebrities come out and, you know, actually come out to the open about 9-11.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:10.808]  Well, if everybody would pledge, say, for instance, Don Henley would come out, you know, he knows what's going on, would come out and speak his mind, all the 9-11 truthers would pledge to go buy his new album, you know?
[00:49:11.008 --> 00:49:12.490]  Well, let me take the Dixie Chicks.
[00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.611]  We know they know about 9-11.
[00:49:13.971 --> 00:49:14.772]  They live here in Austin.
[00:49:14.792 --> 00:49:15.652]  I'm going to leave it there.
[00:49:15.993 --> 00:49:18.314]  They've known about 9-11 for four years.
[00:49:18.735 --> 00:49:19.976]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[00:49:21.034 --> 00:49:27.461]  And they got throttled for just saying they were embarrassed of Bush because he's not really a Texan, but they took it out of context.
[00:49:28.021 --> 00:49:30.064]  Because Texans get the blame for all this.
[00:49:30.084 --> 00:49:33.047]  The guys from Kennedy Buckport, Maine, not knocking Maine folks.
[00:49:33.087 --> 00:49:34.728]  They're great, hearty, wonderful people.
[00:49:34.788 --> 00:49:35.409]  I know some of them.
[00:49:35.669 --> 00:49:39.133]  The point is, you wouldn't like it if I came to Maine and gave Maine a bad name.
[00:49:40.194 --> 00:49:41.035]  Or, you know, Connecticut.
[00:49:41.055 --> 00:49:41.936]  They're from both places.
[00:49:42.814 --> 00:49:47.836]  And so when they got attacked, they made triple the money.
[00:49:48.256 --> 00:49:54.019]  When they got boycotted and shut down, it's been in the news, the Dixie Chicks made triple their all-time profits.
[00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:56.920]  So I've been talking to one of the Dixie... I'm not going to get into it.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:01.082]  The point is they're scared to go public, and they need to just go ahead and go public.
[00:50:01.282 --> 00:50:03.323]  They'll tell the truth and make a boatload of money.
[00:50:03.983 --> 00:50:05.504]  You know what else I wanted to mention was
[00:50:06.457 --> 00:50:11.720]  I have been a regular, and I have a bunch of friends that are regulars, on the MSNBC message boards.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:18.623]  And recently, about a month ago, they started banning and deleting 9-11 posts and the users.
[00:50:18.683 --> 00:50:20.984]  They started banning their screen names.
[00:50:21.545 --> 00:50:25.947]  So I'd advise everybody just to go to Google and type in MSNBC message boards.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.601]  And go there to the U.S.
[00:50:27.641 --> 00:50:30.842]  message board and to the Keith Olbermann message board.
[00:50:30.882 --> 00:50:32.723]  And put links to Terror Storm everywhere.
[00:50:32.903 --> 00:50:39.687]  Oh yeah, and tear it up because I have like 15 different screen names I have to use just so I can get on their stupid site because they keep banning...
[00:50:40.362 --> 00:50:42.004]  Everybody's screaming him off there.
[00:50:44.347 --> 00:50:48.552]  There's been a second hit piece in a month, the London Guardian against Luce Change 2nd edition.
[00:50:48.933 --> 00:50:49.654]  Big one today.
[00:50:49.674 --> 00:50:55.561]  The article came out yesterday and there were something like 200 and something pages of posts.
[00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:56.783]  There were thousands of them.
[00:50:57.521 --> 00:51:02.565]  I mean, just within a day, and almost all of them are attacking the hit piece.
[00:51:03.125 --> 00:51:04.286]  So they're panicking!
[00:51:04.326 --> 00:51:11.711]  They can't have their illusion that everybody buys the official story, and everyone loves Bush, and everyone loves Blair, and everyone buys the fraud.
[00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:16.294]  They know 84% think they're being lied to in scientific polls on 9-11.
[00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:17.175]  They're panicking!
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:28.312]  Every time Keith Olbermann has a special comment, you'll notice all his posts get erased and they put up a bunch of troll threads to spark interest on the fight between the right and the left.
[00:51:28.773 --> 00:51:30.455]  Yeah, that Olbermann's got a big problem.
[00:51:30.495 --> 00:51:32.437]  He's totally keeping in the left-right paradigm.
[00:51:32.838 --> 00:51:33.519]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:33.599 --> 00:51:34.680]  Thanks for the call.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.061]  Stay with us.
[00:51:39.008 --> 00:51:44.432]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:44.792 --> 00:51:52.437]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:53.126 --> 00:52:00.188]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:00.568 --> 00:52:12.011]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:12.311 --> 00:52:15.852]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:16.292 --> 00:52:18.193]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:18.533 --> 00:52:22.394]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:29.879 --> 00:54:31.420]  HerbalHealer.com.
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:34.362]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:54:49.941 --> 00:54:58.027]  Alright, let's go to Ron in Thailand and John a little closer to home in Texas, Glenn in New Jersey, Sean in Mass, Chris in Florida and others.
[00:54:58.467 --> 00:55:00.669]  Ron in Thailand, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:02.550]  Well, hi Alex.
[00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:06.033]  You know, the times sure are interesting, aren't they?
[00:55:06.813 --> 00:55:08.154]  May you live in interesting times.
[00:55:08.194 --> 00:55:09.175]  A blessing and a curse.
[00:55:10.115 --> 00:55:10.376]  Yes.
[00:55:11.857 --> 00:55:13.178]  You know, I've got two things.
[00:55:13.198 --> 00:55:17.601]  I wonder, have you, and I'm serious, have you ever considered running for Governor of Texas?
[00:55:19.586 --> 00:55:22.568]  No, I really am not going to run for political office.
[00:55:22.909 --> 00:55:24.891]  And unlike Hillary Clinton, I mean that.
[00:55:26.232 --> 00:55:38.164]  In the sense that you've got your... I mean, for example, you know, in this war protest they had the other week, I saw one brilliant sign that said, Impeach Cheney first!
[00:55:39.565 --> 00:55:42.388]  You know, I wonder, would you or any of your listeners be
[00:55:43.098 --> 00:55:46.721]  Supporting that, an impeachment of Cheney, even Pelosi said she didn't want to impeach Bush.
[00:55:46.781 --> 00:55:54.467]  We supported an impeachment of them all, but Pelosi's on the same payroll of British and AIPAC and everybody else.
[00:55:54.848 --> 00:56:02.554]  I know that, but see, celebrities won't say that 9-11 was staged by our government, but... A lot of celebrities actually have.
[00:56:03.395 --> 00:56:05.196]  Okay, but our own representatives won't say it.
[00:56:05.456 --> 00:56:08.719]  I mean, everybody was scared by that anthrax thing.
[00:56:08.799 --> 00:56:09.780]  Everybody's normal.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.541]  Which was clearly the government.
[00:56:12.262 --> 00:56:12.442]  What?
[00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:15.051]  Which was clearly the government again, the anthrax.
[00:56:15.451 --> 00:56:16.031]  Right, right.
[00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:18.192]  So they're in Washington, D.C.
[00:56:18.232 --> 00:56:19.533]  They're there.
[00:56:19.553 --> 00:56:21.534]  I mean, you know, Ron Paul hasn't said it.
[00:56:21.574 --> 00:56:23.014]  Even Kucinich hasn't said it.
[00:56:23.575 --> 00:56:24.115]  Chuck Hagel.
[00:56:24.495 --> 00:56:26.636]  Nobody in Congress even has said.
[00:56:27.016 --> 00:56:30.558]  But I mean, if you just theoretically listen, fantasy, fantasy politics.
[00:56:30.618 --> 00:56:37.761]  If you ran for governor, you could say, I'm hereby running because I don't like that they're building a superhighway into my state.
[00:56:37.821 --> 00:56:40.742]  I don't like that they're running a prison camp north of Austin.
[00:56:41.198 --> 00:56:47.623]  I don't like that our current governor is trying to inoculate our children.
[00:56:48.484 --> 00:56:50.486]  I'm from California originally.
[00:56:50.826 --> 00:56:55.390]  Do you have a recall process in Texas to recall the governor at all?
[00:56:55.590 --> 00:57:02.836]  Yes, you can start recall on the governor, and the governor is the weakest of the 50 states here in Texas.
[00:57:02.916 --> 00:57:03.997]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:05.078 --> 00:57:09.081]  Number one, a large portion of the state
[00:57:10.828 --> 00:57:18.715]  I know it's 30 plus percent, has the government controlled, highly manipulatable, no record of how you vote in electronic voting machines.
[00:57:18.755 --> 00:57:20.136]  So first we have to remove those.
[00:57:21.817 --> 00:57:28.323]  Number two, I would have to raise about 30 million dollars to effectively run for governor.
[00:57:28.363 --> 00:57:31.105]  And then all they would do is have three or four more candidates run.
[00:57:31.926 --> 00:57:37.776]  So that Rick Perry would lose, but he would still win because they would break the vote up so much.
[00:57:38.217 --> 00:57:42.585]  And mindless neocon Republicans who all they care about
[00:57:45.035 --> 00:57:46.276]  Is having a Republican in.
[00:57:46.316 --> 00:57:47.637]  They don't care about conservatism.
[00:57:47.877 --> 00:57:48.998]  They don't care about America.
[00:57:49.038 --> 00:57:53.462]  They just got American flags made in China flapping in their yard, all over their cars.
[00:57:53.802 --> 00:57:54.823]  They just feel good.
[00:57:54.883 --> 00:57:56.084]  Everything's alright.
[00:57:56.524 --> 00:57:57.805]  Everything's going well.
[00:57:58.145 --> 00:57:59.206]  We're doing good.
[00:57:59.226 --> 00:58:00.587]  I like Perry.
[00:58:01.808 --> 00:58:03.169]  Sportsman for Perry.
[00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:06.191]  We need to go ahead and let the illegals in.
[00:58:06.231 --> 00:58:07.192]  They work hard.
[00:58:07.212 --> 00:58:09.794]  And that's their attitude.
[00:58:09.894 --> 00:58:13.697]  They can't face up what's happened to this society.
[00:58:14.514 --> 00:58:21.318]  They can't deal with it psychologically, so they just tell themselves everything's fine as long as we kill Arabs, everything will be alright.
[00:58:21.358 --> 00:58:23.479]  It's some brown people over there, need to kill them.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.120]  I'm an American.
[00:58:27.441 --> 00:58:28.321]  And that's the end of it.
[00:58:29.462 --> 00:58:37.806]  So, we need people to run for city council, to run for water commissioners, or to be on the water board.
[00:58:38.727 --> 00:58:40.528]  We need good people to infest
[00:58:41.238 --> 00:58:43.059]  The entire structure of local government.
[00:58:43.579 --> 00:58:44.879]  That's where you can get in.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:49.121]  That's where you can even keep your views quiet and slip in.
[00:58:49.821 --> 00:58:54.063]  That's where you can, you know, they were always quiet and sneaky about being globalist and getting in.
[00:58:54.443 --> 00:59:00.405]  Now patriots are being sneaky and just towing the middle of the road and getting in and causing all sorts of havoc.
[00:59:00.945 --> 00:59:03.086]  Oh yeah, people are really getting smart out there.
[00:59:04.186 --> 00:59:05.727]  So it's a process, it's a fight.
[00:59:06.047 --> 00:59:07.568]  Alright, more of your calls straight ahead.
[00:59:07.608 --> 00:59:10.169]  We've also got Michael Rivero joining us later.

[01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:14.126]  He'll be coming up in the next segment to break down his analysis on world events and current news and information.
[01:01:14.166 --> 01:01:17.409]  It is always informative and it should be today.
[01:01:18.729 --> 01:01:20.290]  Continuing with phone calls right now.
[01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:22.372]  Open phones on this Tuesday edition.
[01:01:23.252 --> 01:01:29.877]  Let's go ahead and talk to... I guess it would be Glenn in New Jersey is up next.
[01:01:30.626 --> 01:01:31.567]  Glenn, you're on the air.
[01:01:31.627 --> 01:01:31.987]  Welcome.
[01:01:32.828 --> 01:01:33.108]  Hi.
[01:01:33.188 --> 01:01:33.749]  How's it going?
[01:01:33.869 --> 01:01:34.610]  Good, sir.
[01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:36.071]  Just reporting back to you.
[01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:46.540]  I called in last week to let you know that right after I witnessed 9-11 from my high school, I went back to talk to some students to basically warn them.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.763]  It was totally impromptu, but I made it happen.
[01:01:50.343 --> 01:01:57.850]  After seeing such individuals as John Connor, yourself, first of all, I want to really appreciate what you do.
[01:01:58.717 --> 01:02:07.023]  You know, for many years, you know, I thought I was crazy and I finally found the 9-11 Truth Movement and I'm proud of what we've been able to accomplish.
[01:02:07.063 --> 01:02:08.404]  We're pushing them back.
[01:02:08.444 --> 01:02:11.807]  Well, 84% of us are crazy and believe we're being lied to on 9-11.
[01:02:11.827 --> 01:02:14.869]  90-plus percent believe we're being lied to about Kennedy.
[01:02:15.089 --> 01:02:16.130]  We're all insane.
[01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.872]  The government's good and loving and we should totally trust them.
[01:02:19.332 --> 01:02:23.815]  Yeah, like I approach people, commoners on the street and I talk to them about 9-11 and
[01:02:24.932 --> 01:02:30.255]  You know, some really skeptical people will look at you and say, what kind of physics brought those towers down?
[01:02:30.295 --> 01:02:31.135]  Left-wing physics?
[01:02:31.175 --> 01:02:34.117]  And I'm like, no sir, I'm not a liberal left-wing conservative.
[01:02:34.157 --> 01:02:35.578]  See, this is a left-right paradigm.
[01:02:35.638 --> 01:02:36.938]  It shifts off thinking.
[01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:39.880]  Oh, you're pro-gun, you're liberal!
[01:02:40.721 --> 01:02:43.622]  You're one of those right-wing Republicans one time I got told.
[01:02:43.642 --> 01:02:45.803]  You know, we got a compromise on the Second Amendment.
[01:02:45.943 --> 01:02:47.104]  Everything is left-right.
[01:02:48.033 --> 01:02:50.375]  People don't like to talk about the issues anymore.
[01:02:50.656 --> 01:02:52.377]  They just attack ad hominem.
[01:02:52.397 --> 01:02:53.438]  They attack the character.
[01:02:53.739 --> 01:03:07.592]  One fella I talked to last night made the point that he works in retail and he says that two generations of adults and their children, because the retail store is across the street from a high school, can't even count change.
[01:03:07.912 --> 01:03:09.694]  They just push a pile of change
[01:03:10.643 --> 01:03:10.923]  I don't
[01:03:26.545 --> 01:03:41.613]  You've got that general group who's completely dumbed down, doesn't know how anything works, has no idea, doesn't care, they're thinking about their next thrill, you know, satiating their bestial level, and then you've got a huge group of people that are waking up and getting smarter and more informed every day.
[01:03:41.953 --> 01:03:44.134]  So it's a clash of civilizations.
[01:03:45.852 --> 01:03:47.652]  I was well received at the high school.
[01:03:47.852 --> 01:03:55.054]  I just wanted to let you know that a lot of the kids were thankful, they were grateful that they had someone actually come in and talk to them about this.
[01:03:55.094 --> 01:03:58.395]  Let me get this straight, you're a graduate who then came back and spoke to school?
[01:03:58.855 --> 01:03:59.735]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:04:00.415 --> 01:04:09.877]  In my sophomore year of high school, and of course everyone remembers where they were that particular day, I was in a room on the fourth floor of the top level of my high school and
[01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:18.233]  Uh, I had witnessed, you know, basically, I heard the rumbling of the Twin Towers, and I was like, what, did they just blow them up, like they just demolished the towers?
[01:04:18.494 --> 01:04:24.983]  I mean, people are so dumbed down that, on TV, you've got comments... You just said that you were well-received, though.
[01:04:25.763 --> 01:04:26.823]  Oh yes, most definitely.
[01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:31.665]  But I mean, the initial reaction, the nation's initial reaction to 9-11 was so embarrassing.
[01:04:31.685 --> 01:04:38.008]  You've got commentators on TV saying, oh look, the building collapsed, when it's still not fully demolished.
[01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:42.890]  It's still coming down, you know, symmetrically, peeling away like a banana, which only explosives can do.
[01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:46.811]  And then, you know, people don't recognize the coup d'etat when it happens.
[01:04:46.851 --> 01:04:47.912]  I mean, I hear you.
[01:04:48.292 --> 01:04:48.712]  I hear you.
[01:04:48.732 --> 01:04:49.352]  We've got a break.
[01:04:49.372 --> 01:04:50.353]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[01:04:50.373 --> 01:04:51.633]  I appreciate it.
[01:04:51.673 --> 01:04:53.074]  We'll get to Sean and
[01:04:53.983 --> 01:05:02.909]  Scott and others, Chris, that are patiently holding with our guest who's coming up, Michael Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:05:03.409 --> 01:05:07.711]  My websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:20.764]  And of course, we have other sites like jonesreport.com, marshalllaw911.info, arnoldexposed.com, and a really big one we're going to be launching in the next few months.
[01:05:21.804 --> 01:05:23.405]  Wait until we launch this, you're going to love it.
[01:05:23.865 --> 01:05:26.086]  It'll be a major salvo against the globalists.
[01:05:26.106 --> 01:05:27.067]  Stay with us.
[01:05:35.552 --> 01:05:38.735]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:05:39.055 --> 01:05:40.997]  Mighty Film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:41.378 --> 01:05:48.985]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:56.739]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:57.159 --> 01:06:08.564]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:08.884 --> 01:06:12.386]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:12.846 --> 01:06:14.767]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:15.127 --> 01:06:18.889]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:32.498 --> 01:06:37.462]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:06:37.762 --> 01:06:40.004]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[01:06:40.084 --> 01:06:47.549]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:50.912]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:06:51.212 --> 01:06:54.635]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:06:54.975 --> 01:07:04.317]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:07:04.577 --> 01:07:08.078]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:38.823]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:56.790 --> 01:08:59.752]  Michael Rivero is our guest in this hour.
[01:08:59.812 --> 01:09:02.634]  We have also a lot of folks holding online.
[01:09:02.934 --> 01:09:19.086]  Talk about any issue you wish, Mike can chime in on it because like InfoWars.com, WhatReallyHappened.com gives you wide spectrum news analysis and original investigations as well as linking to important stories on the economy, the war, the police state, the IRS, you name it.
[01:09:19.915 --> 01:09:22.717]  Mike, so much has happened since we talked to you last month.
[01:09:23.518 --> 01:09:27.821]  Tell the listeners some of the things you think that are most important right now that you'd like to go over.
[01:09:29.102 --> 01:09:34.186]  Well, I think it is very obvious at this point that we're headed into an invasion of Iran.
[01:09:35.353 --> 01:09:51.836]  And it is, I think, a little bit of a shock to a lot of Americans how very much it is clear that President Bush is simply not paying attention to his own experts and his own advisors about the potential negative consequences of such an invasion.
[01:09:52.197 --> 01:09:59.058]  And more to the point, especially after the change of Congress last November, I think a lot of Americans were
[01:09:59.522 --> 01:10:00.042]  I don't know.
[01:10:18.363 --> 01:10:28.590]  We're seeing a lot of tough talk about Iraq coming from the presidential candidates, and it does appear to be nothing more than talk, because it's an important point to keep in mind.
[01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:35.335]  Congress has all the legal authority it needs to stop these wars dead in their tracks, and yet Congress
[01:10:36.414 --> 01:10:38.775]  is doing symbolic gestures.
[01:10:38.795 --> 01:10:39.976]  They're not even doing that.
[01:10:40.296 --> 01:10:49.761]  Yesterday, the Republicans were able to even block discussion of a non-binding symbolic anti-Iraq war resolution and keep that from the floor.
[01:10:50.181 --> 01:11:04.968]  All of the candidates, including Clinton and Obama and Edwards, while they are very critical about our current situation in Iraq, they are not showing any indication that they are opposed to the coming invasion of Iran.
[01:11:05.666 --> 01:11:08.668]  We're continuing to see such a huge military buildup in there.
[01:11:09.608 --> 01:11:16.231]  Just a few days ago, destroyers from right here in Hawaii at Pearl Harbor were deployed to support the USS Reagan.
[01:11:17.432 --> 01:11:29.198]  So, nobody sends this amount of hardware into a part of the globe without intending to use it, and this does mimic the military buildup we saw in the region prior to the invasion of Iraq.
[01:11:29.638 --> 01:11:33.580]  So, the war in Iran is on, they're just looking for an excuse.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.962]  That could be a false flag, government-sponsored terror event.
[01:11:38.222 --> 01:11:41.244]  It could be, quote, a engineered accident.
[01:11:42.305 --> 01:11:45.387]  You have the majority of the troops, 70 plus percent, wanting to come home.
[01:11:46.508 --> 01:11:52.472]  You've got 78 percent of Americans in major polls, repeatedly, not wanting this war.
[01:11:53.172 --> 01:11:54.933]  And instead, Bush just boosts troops.
[01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:57.655]  It's like Rick Perry in Texas with a live cancer virus.
[01:11:58.256 --> 01:11:59.116]  There is no law.
[01:11:59.156 --> 01:12:00.937]  He just lies and says there's a law.
[01:12:02.638 --> 01:12:04.660]  And says you've got to take a live cancer virus.
[01:12:05.413 --> 01:12:17.073]  I mean, why are we seeing just wanton abandon where the government says, we don't care what you want, we don't care what's constitutional, we're just going to be lawless, basically.
[01:12:18.988 --> 01:12:26.432]  Well, what we're seeing here is a government that is clearly more concerned with the agenda of a foreign government than with the American people.
[01:12:26.472 --> 01:12:31.835]  And I think it is very telling as we watch the candidates for the 2008 presidential race line up.
[01:12:32.215 --> 01:12:38.199]  The very first thing they do is go over to Israel and stand up there and say, we will back Israel and we will do this and we will do that.
[01:12:39.099 --> 01:12:43.982]  And we're not even seeing that kind of electioneering here among the American voters.
[01:12:44.062 --> 01:12:45.483]  So it's very alarming.
[01:12:46.999 --> 01:12:53.763]  Despite the spy scandal, AIPAC is continuing to shake the American government for the benefit of Israel.
[01:12:54.744 --> 01:13:01.629]  Well, it can't be denied that the first place they go is to AIPAC meetings at the Marriott there in Times Square.
[01:13:01.689 --> 01:13:03.170]  The first place they go is Israel.
[01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:06.893]  And they just openly say, you're our bosses, tell us what to do.
[01:13:06.913 --> 01:13:08.614]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[01:13:10.431 --> 01:13:10.691]  It is.
[01:13:10.851 --> 01:13:11.552]  It is pathetic.
[01:13:11.652 --> 01:13:12.332]  It's dangerous.
[01:13:12.492 --> 01:13:15.593]  It's what got Charles I in trouble with his people.
[01:13:16.133 --> 01:13:22.156]  And I think, ultimately, we're going to be headed for the same kind of an upset here, which I don't like.
[01:13:22.296 --> 01:13:24.357]  I don't condone or encourage violence.
[01:13:24.537 --> 01:13:34.380]  But at this particular point, I keep thinking about that quote that John and Robert Kennedy always used to say, which is, when peaceful revolution becomes impossible, violent revolution becomes inevitable.
[01:13:34.981 --> 01:13:38.302]  And I don't see any way to avoid it at this point.
[01:13:39.585 --> 01:13:42.946]  Now, nothing happens that the oil companies and the big banks don't want.
[01:13:43.427 --> 01:13:44.887]  And they're more than happy to have the U.S.
[01:13:44.947 --> 01:13:54.571]  military and the Israeli military nuke Iran, attack their entire military infrastructure, and that's the admitted plan, not strategic surgical strikes.
[01:13:55.532 --> 01:14:03.115]  But John Edwards was on Meet the Press this weekend, and he did say, now the European bankers are upset.
[01:14:03.155 --> 01:14:05.176]  I mean, I don't think that was a slip-up.
[01:14:05.576 --> 01:14:08.637]  Do you really think that there is a split now between the New World Order
[01:14:10.828 --> 01:14:26.340]  Well, I think what we're seeing in all of these events is there are multiple overlapping factions with multiple overlapping agendas, and certainly anytime you're talking about one country invading another, not all of the financial interests in the world are going to be that pleased with it.
[01:14:27.942 --> 01:14:38.210]  The other possible reason behind the comment is that most expert analysts are saying that an invasion of Iran, when Iraq is already such a disaster,
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.480]  It's likely to fail.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:43.041]  It is likely to have a very negative backlash.
[01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:49.403]  The European bankers may be seeing this invasion of Iran as effectively raising on a busted flush.
[01:14:49.803 --> 01:14:53.724]  It doesn't matter how hard they play, it's not going to come out the way that they want it to.
[01:14:54.144 --> 01:14:56.965]  And that's probably going to generate a lot of criticism right now.
[01:14:57.865 --> 01:14:58.705]  So let's be clear.
[01:14:59.045 --> 01:15:08.748]  The European branch wants war, wants globalization, wants domination, wants to seize those oil supplies to then artificially jack up the price of the peak oil scam.
[01:15:09.787 --> 01:15:13.030]  We know that they have the same goals.
[01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:19.074]  There's just arguments about how to carry out the program, how to implement the overall agenda.
[01:15:19.094 --> 01:15:23.097]  But here we are, Michael Rivera, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[01:15:23.598 --> 01:15:24.639]  The people don't want it.
[01:15:24.999 --> 01:15:28.041]  It's going to cause a worldwide recession at the bare minimum.
[01:15:29.062 --> 01:15:33.165]  It's going to shut down many of those central waterways in the Middle East.
[01:15:33.806 --> 01:15:37.829]  It's going to cause gas prices, conservative reports are saying, to triple.
[01:15:39.329 --> 01:15:41.930]  I mean, this for the average person is going to be bad.
[01:15:42.831 --> 01:15:46.393]  We really have a $97 trillion debt obligation.
[01:15:46.993 --> 01:15:58.599]  It's $4.9 trillion per year right now, but if you count everything that we actually owe, it's close to $100 trillion, that $97 trillion number from last year.
[01:15:58.619 --> 01:16:03.642]  And of course, so it's grown now to actually over $100 trillion, but that's been an official
[01:16:04.759 --> 01:16:05.420]  We're good to go.
[01:16:17.967 --> 01:16:18.948]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:19.849]  The U.S.
[01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:22.170]  is over-leveraged and over-extended.
[01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:28.895]  But before I get back to that, I want to go back to something that you were just saying before about how the European bankers and the New World Order want certain things.
[01:16:29.215 --> 01:16:31.277]  But you also need to remember what they don't want.
[01:16:31.377 --> 01:16:40.804]  And what they don't want is a massive failure that is going to basically rip the cover off the whole mechanism of what's going on.
[01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:44.106]  You know, we're looking at Tony Blair.
[01:16:44.226 --> 01:16:51.788]  We take a major fall over the Cash for Honor scandal, and I've written many times that Tony Blair is George Bush's mining canary.
[01:16:51.868 --> 01:16:56.269]  In other words, when Blair goes down, Bush will know that he himself is in immediate danger.
[01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:59.170]  If Bush goes down and the U.S.
[01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:03.672]  government suffers a major constitutional crisis, a lot of hidden agendas and
[01:17:04.865 --> 01:17:06.486]  Influence is going to be exposed.
[01:17:06.526 --> 01:17:12.588]  We're already seeing it with AIPAC's influence on our government being exposed and becoming very common knowledge.
[01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.869]  That's the last thing that they really want.
[01:17:15.269 --> 01:17:28.434]  So I think a lot of this hesitation to go into Iran are a lot of people saying, you know, we probably ought to like just stand at where we are right now rather than risk losing everything if it all comes unraveled in a botched invasion of Iran.
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:42.444]  Getting away from that, back to this financial leverage situation, yes, there is no question that the United States government is in serious financial trouble, and has been for a great many years, going back to the Reagan presidency.
[01:17:42.464 --> 01:17:52.667]  But that's by design, so that the globalists can create a financial situation where everyone's in debt, they then control the currency, and they get to come in and buy it all up for pennies on the dollar, or even cheaper.
[01:17:53.815 --> 01:17:59.586]  Yeah, and this game has been played with a lot of other countries and now they're playing it with ours.
[01:17:59.866 --> 01:18:05.517]  And if you go back again to the Reagan presidency and the elder Bush presidency that followed it,
[01:18:06.401 --> 01:18:09.284]  Those years saw two phenomena.
[01:18:09.465 --> 01:18:16.132]  One was the greatest transfer of wealth from the middle to the upper classes in our nation's history, and second, the U.S.
[01:18:16.172 --> 01:18:23.580]  went from being the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest decker nation, and most of that money that was borrowed was borrowed
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.341]  I think so.
[01:18:41.039 --> 01:18:52.915]  And I think we're at a point right now where most Americans are starting to wonder why should we go on slaving away, literally giving half of everything we ever make to the government, when it's a hopeless case anyway?
[01:18:53.596 --> 01:18:58.102]  And, you know, that maybe the US government should go the same way as the USSR did.
[01:18:58.342 --> 01:19:00.502]  Michael Rivero, I think in the final analysis it comes down to this.
[01:19:00.662 --> 01:19:03.023]  The elites and their management cultures, their management guilds,
[01:19:28.593 --> 01:19:30.634]  Know everything's spiraling out of control.
[01:19:31.194 --> 01:19:34.776]  Know that everything is driving towards crises and implosion.
[01:19:35.136 --> 01:19:41.220]  And they'd rather set off the implosion themselves to at least have some semblance of control.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:48.803]  And so that's why you have the FEMA camps, and that's why you have the open borders, and that's why you have just the out-of-control spending.
[01:19:49.564 --> 01:19:52.746]  It's like when you spray cockroaches with poison, they start fornicating.
[01:19:53.926 --> 01:19:56.968]  I mean, really, I think that all of this so-called arrogance and
[01:19:58.212 --> 01:19:58.873]  I would agree.
[01:19:58.893 --> 01:20:01.776]  We're seeing a lot of thrashing.
[01:20:01.796 --> 01:20:03.838]  We're seeing a very high economic fever.
[01:20:11.813 --> 01:20:14.395]  The longer it continues, the worse the crash will be.
[01:20:14.415 --> 01:20:15.556]  Michael Rivero, stay there.
[01:20:15.576 --> 01:20:19.299]  More key issues straight ahead in your calls, right here on Genesis.
[01:20:32.765 --> 01:20:37.366]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:20:37.567 --> 01:20:42.008]  It provides you with purified water, light, power and communications ability.

[01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:56.233]  The Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[01:21:13.739 --> 01:21:14.239]  We're good to go.
[01:21:32.313 --> 01:21:33.334]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:21:33.374 --> 01:21:33.715]  February 6, 2007.
[01:21:33.895 --> 01:21:34.135]  Gold 656.40.
[01:21:34.255 --> 01:21:37.218]  Ounce gold coins are 677.69, 341.39 for half, 168.37 for quarter ounce.
[01:21:37.238 --> 01:21:37.358]  That's 677.69, 341.39, 168.37.
[01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:49.730]  1971, Nissan closes the gold window.
[01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:50.630]  Fiat currency.
[01:21:51.391 --> 01:21:55.212]  1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[01:21:55.532 --> 01:21:57.373]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:01.655]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[01:22:01.935 --> 01:22:04.056]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:22:04.076 --> 01:22:07.637]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:22:07.877 --> 01:22:13.000]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.440]  Could government let this happen?
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.521]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:22:16.761 --> 01:22:23.746]  Midas has Nick Bereshoff's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:22:23.786 --> 01:22:25.507]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:22:25.567 --> 01:22:26.708]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:22:26.728 --> 01:22:27.068]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:32.941 --> 01:22:35.602]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:36.002 --> 01:22:48.306]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C., and therefore bypass the state governments?
[01:22:49.186 --> 01:22:52.887]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington D.C.
[01:22:53.728 --> 01:22:59.869]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?
[01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:08.132]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:23:10.514 --> 01:23:11.915]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:12.735]  Call now.
[01:23:12.755 --> 01:23:16.178]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:23:29.344 --> 01:23:33.908]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:23:34.328 --> 01:23:37.271]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:23:37.571 --> 01:23:40.133]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:23:40.513 --> 01:23:45.317]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:23:45.718 --> 01:23:51.082]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:23:51.382 --> 01:23:54.345]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:23:54.525 --> 01:23:55.685]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[01:23:57.166 --> 01:24:01.887]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[01:24:02.087 --> 01:24:06.228]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[01:24:06.528 --> 01:24:12.809]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:14.769]  It says, worship the beast.
[01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:17.650]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:23.395]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:24:23.415 --> 01:24:23.955]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:24:24.055 --> 01:24:26.918]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[01:24:44.981 --> 01:24:46.002]  Welcome back.
[01:24:46.142 --> 01:24:51.267]  Michael Rovero is our guest.
[01:24:52.868 --> 01:25:02.336]  You're called for coming up in the next segment.
[01:25:02.516 --> 01:25:06.679]  Also, for about 10 minutes,
[01:25:13.823 --> 01:25:24.085]  We're going to have Robert Wattada on, the father of Lieutenant Wattada, who had already been in the military, already been overseas, and he said, look, I'm not going to be part of this criminal war.
[01:25:25.146 --> 01:25:28.586]  And they said, that's it, we're court-martialing you, so that's coming up.
[01:25:29.387 --> 01:25:34.268]  Michael Rivera, also, you've got a new show here on Genesis that's doing quite well, a lot of folks are tuning into it.
[01:25:34.668 --> 01:25:35.668]  Tell the listeners about that.
[01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:39.659]  Well, it's the What Really Happened radio show.
[01:25:39.819 --> 01:25:42.180]  It is on Saturday mornings at 11 a.m.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:42.920]  Central Time.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.942]  You can listen to it over the GCN Live website, or you can visit the archive and pick up some of the shows.
[01:25:48.682 --> 01:26:00.726]  And we're going to be covering the looming war in Iran on this Saturday's show, and certainly we'll be paying a great deal of attention to the influence that AIPAC seems to have over the decision to go to wars in the United States.
[01:26:01.066 --> 01:26:05.448]  Now, this is a conditioning process, and I've been saying this since before the Iraq War.
[01:26:06.477 --> 01:26:08.465]  Because P-Nack told us so!
[01:26:09.272 --> 01:26:23.160]  That they were just going to get into Iraq and use that as a beachhead to go into Iran and Syria, and then sew up the entire region, and then balkanize, and turn people along sectarian and religious lines, Sunni-Shia-Kurd against each other, and now all that's happened.
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:23.560]  Wow!
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:24.481]  They told us they'd do it?
[01:26:24.981 --> 01:26:26.102]  Man, I've got a crystal ball.
[01:26:26.142 --> 01:26:28.963]  I know how to read everything they've said they'll do.
[01:26:29.023 --> 01:26:29.824]  They actually do.
[01:26:29.844 --> 01:26:32.746]  Then they have their public pronouncements that are total lies.
[01:26:32.766 --> 01:26:33.946]  You want to know what they're really doing?
[01:26:33.986 --> 01:26:37.648]  Just turn it around backwards, and more often than not, that's the answer.
[01:26:37.688 --> 01:26:38.509]  But Mike,
[01:26:39.049 --> 01:26:40.150]  It's a conditioning process.
[01:26:40.311 --> 01:26:42.332]  I almost just expect, okay, when's the war?
[01:26:42.373 --> 01:26:43.534]  When's the attack going to happen?
[01:26:43.854 --> 01:26:53.623]  Because for two years they've been beating the drums to attack Iran or longer, and at a certain point it conditions us that it's almost a foregone conclusion.
[01:26:54.364 --> 01:26:58.008]  And they did that with Iraq for stringing it out for, what, two and a half years?
[01:26:58.428 --> 01:27:00.390]  And of course even before Bush got in office with Clinton.
[01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:02.192]  Can you comment on that process?
[01:27:03.925 --> 01:27:15.075]  Well, I think it's a propagandistic ploy to basically just get everybody so used to the idea that it's coming that when it finally happens that the anger and outrage is kept to an absolute minimum.
[01:27:16.256 --> 01:27:28.426]  It is entirely possible that in their arrogance and hubris that Israel and or the United States may simply attack Iran without needing or feeling that they need any kind of a justifying cause.
[01:27:29.019 --> 01:27:29.780]  Certainly the U.S.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:35.006]  is continuing to wave around February 21st and the end of the U.N.
[01:27:35.046 --> 01:27:39.411]  deadline as a major flag for a reason to invade Iran.
[01:27:39.612 --> 01:27:43.096]  But if Israel couldn't even take southern Lebanon...
[01:27:44.526 --> 01:27:47.627]  What are they going to do with Iran?
[01:27:47.707 --> 01:27:49.408]  I mean, you've been studying this.
[01:27:49.608 --> 01:27:53.509]  Give us your take on the mindset of those currently in control.
[01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:54.830]  I mean, what are you going to say?
[01:27:54.910 --> 01:28:00.332]  That, well, they know they can't win a ground war, so they're just going to start heavy bombardments with conventional and nukes?
[01:28:01.849 --> 01:28:03.189]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[01:28:03.289 --> 01:28:10.671]  If Israel wants to start this war, all they have to do is fly over Iran and start dropping bombs, and then fly back to Israel.
[01:28:10.711 --> 01:28:17.553]  Now, if you look at the map of the region, you know, where does Iran have to march through to counter-attack, retaliate against Israel?
[01:28:17.613 --> 01:28:23.595]  They have to go right through Iraq, and all of our American men and women in uniform sitting there in the region.
[01:28:23.755 --> 01:28:32.683]  And then they're going to get overwhelmed and overrun, and oh my gosh, we're getting beat, and so now we've got to have a draft in 500,000, and Americans can't get whooped, and it's World War III.
[01:28:33.724 --> 01:28:34.684]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:28:34.825 --> 01:28:40.710]  The potential for this situation to spiral out of control into a major global war... It's designed to!
[01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:45.674]  It's designed to spiral out of control, as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, yourself, and many other analysts have said.
[01:28:46.812 --> 01:28:47.853]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:28:48.093 --> 01:28:58.664]  And the idea is that, you know, we're all, the whole world right now is held hostage to whichever world leader is the least mentally stable.
[01:28:58.744 --> 01:28:59.925]  And that's not a pleasant thought.
[01:28:59.945 --> 01:29:01.086]  It's going to keep you up late at night.
[01:29:01.106 --> 01:29:07.092]  Because they're so confident with all these yes-men and mistresses and living in ivory towers that they think they can manage this crisis.
[01:29:08.303 --> 01:29:09.023]  Absolutely.
[01:29:09.183 --> 01:29:16.266]  One of the problems that we have is there are so many levels of mid-management surrounding these key decision makers.
[01:29:16.706 --> 01:29:18.727]  They're really cut off from what's going on.
[01:29:19.067 --> 01:29:24.989]  Some of the statements that we have seen come out of Washington, D.C., and especially the White House, seem almost absurd.
[01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:36.594]  But they make a lot more sense if you realize that the people making them don't understand how much the American people have come to understand about what's going on, about how much they were lied to.
[01:29:37.572 --> 01:29:50.309]  I mean, it's almost insulting that Bush and his people are continuing to use nuclear threat, nuclear threat as a reason to go to war with Iran as if they don't understand that the Americans know they were lying.
[01:29:50.349 --> 01:29:55.016]  Well, they just replaced a K with an N with the propaganda.
[01:29:55.922 --> 01:29:57.724]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:29:58.424 --> 01:30:02.147]  And it's, like I said, it's an insult.
[01:30:02.167 --> 01:30:07.312]  They think that the same lines are going to work twice in a row, and they don't understand it's not working.
[01:30:07.392 --> 01:30:18.181]  And to me, it signals that we have a government that really is, as much as they are in bed with AIPAC and the Israeli government, they're totally cut off from what the Americans are thinking.
[01:30:18.381 --> 01:30:18.802]  Stay with us.
[01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:24.011]  We're on the march.
[01:30:24.311 --> 01:30:25.931]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:26.812 --> 01:30:29.633]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:35.115 --> 01:30:35.876]  Pinch me, Bill.
[01:30:36.136 --> 01:30:37.096]  I can't believe it.
[01:30:37.536 --> 01:30:40.278]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[01:30:40.698 --> 01:30:43.199]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[01:30:44.332 --> 01:30:45.413]  I know what you mean, John.
[01:30:45.433 --> 01:30:49.657]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[01:30:50.157 --> 01:30:53.960]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:55.622]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[01:30:56.102 --> 01:31:00.946]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[01:31:01.287 --> 01:31:02.348]  And I owe it all to you.
[01:31:02.928 --> 01:31:06.231]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:06.311 --> 01:31:09.354]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[01:31:09.374 --> 01:31:10.715]  I want to tell everybody.
[01:31:10.935 --> 01:31:14.298]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:16.320]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.282]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[01:31:19.382 --> 01:31:25.588]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[01:31:25.868 --> 01:31:26.689]  What a concept!
[01:31:32.890 --> 01:31:34.651]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:31:34.752 --> 01:31:36.013]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:31:36.253 --> 01:31:39.075]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:31:39.435 --> 01:31:42.197]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[01:31:42.738 --> 01:31:49.483]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:33:41.238 --> 01:34:06.868]  They railed against the crown Another act like that Declaring independence They laid their bodies down On a bloody wall A liberty for their descendants Thanks to the renegades
[01:34:07.384 --> 01:34:08.005]  Welcome back.
[01:34:08.085 --> 01:34:08.845]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:34:08.865 --> 01:34:09.766]  We're not going to keep him long.
[01:34:09.826 --> 01:34:10.707]  He's very, very busy.
[01:34:11.147 --> 01:34:17.272]  Mike Romero of WhatReallyHappened.com, Saturday morning talk show right here on Genesis is riding shotgun with us.
[01:34:17.472 --> 01:34:24.538]  Your calls, John, Sean, Chris, Steve, Ted, your calls are all coming up as well in this hour.
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:32.405]  But the court-martial is now coming up for Aaron Watata and his father joins us, Robert Watata.
[01:34:34.094 --> 01:34:37.617]  And now we have the Iran war looming.
[01:34:37.637 --> 01:34:40.359]  These are completely illegal wars.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.801]  They lied us into war.
[01:34:41.861 --> 01:34:43.662]  That's now on the record premeditatedly.
[01:34:43.722 --> 01:34:46.244]  Not just the yellow cake, but the White House memo.
[01:34:46.845 --> 01:34:49.467]  Robert Matata, tell us what's happening right now with your son.
[01:34:50.828 --> 01:34:51.869]  Okay, Alex.
[01:34:51.909 --> 01:35:00.817]  The court martial started yesterday and this morning it was mostly arguments that Eric Seitz, the attorney, put forth in terms of trying to
[01:35:02.335 --> 01:35:20.428]  Different witnesses on the stand, but he was denied at every single person because that person was going to talk about the Constitution, they were going to talk about international law, they were going to talk about what was going on in Iraq, the atrocities, and they were all denied.
[01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:29.555]  In other words, the government here, the army, doesn't want to have any information that even hints to the fact that there might be
[01:35:30.377 --> 01:35:35.480]  Uh, an illegal invasion or an immoral occupation going on in Iraq.
[01:35:36.921 --> 01:35:42.764]  So, after that, uh... They're going after your son saying that he basically bad-mouthed El Presidente?
[01:35:44.025 --> 01:35:48.548]  Well, he said that the President was deceptive and the military found those words to be offensive.
[01:35:50.369 --> 01:35:55.432]  And he said that there are atrocities going on in Iraq and the military said that's offensive.
[01:35:56.394 --> 01:35:58.256]  Well, people have gone to prison.
[01:35:58.277 --> 01:36:03.123]  I mean, let me just add, people have gone to prison for raping and killing innocent people, Abu Ghraib.
[01:36:03.483 --> 01:36:04.504]  All of that is public.
[01:36:04.584 --> 01:36:06.687]  It's public that the President lied to us to war.
[01:36:07.168 --> 01:36:11.273]  Michael Rivero, you got some questions or comments for Robert Rotata joining us?
[01:36:12.364 --> 01:36:15.605]  Well, Bob and I have already talked about this a lot of times.
[01:36:17.226 --> 01:36:22.488]  Bob's been interviewed on my show, and I did a very nice YouTube video of him that is up there right now.
[01:36:22.948 --> 01:36:36.114]  But I wanted to respond to a comment that was in the news coverage of the court-martial just today, where one of the presiding judges said, there needs to be a limit on dissent in the military
[01:36:36.716 --> 01:36:52.542]  And my response to that would be, where in the Constitution of the United States of America, which we all acknowledge is the supreme law of the land, does it say that people serving in the military may not avail themselves of the same rights and freedoms as ordinary citizens?
[01:36:53.038 --> 01:36:56.040]  Because if you look through the Constitution, it is not there.
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:00.823]  So Aaron Watada does have a right to speak his mind and voice his opinion.
[01:37:01.764 --> 01:37:10.610]  You know, when he's not in formation, when he's just out there socializing with other people, he has as much right to voice his opinion as any other citizen in the United States.
[01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:16.814]  Now, with regard to the illegal war, the reason that the U.S.
[01:37:16.854 --> 01:37:21.717]  government is trying very hard to keep issues of the legality out of the courtroom is they can't
[01:37:22.541 --> 01:37:26.370]  Defeat that argument because the US has signed the Geneva Accords
[01:37:27.166 --> 01:37:31.627]  And under the Constitution, treaty obligations are the supreme law of the land.
[01:37:31.707 --> 01:37:44.289]  And by the way, under a soldier's or an officer's, even at a higher standard's, oath, when they're sworn in to serve in the armed forces, they have to say no to unlawful or illegal orders.
[01:37:44.329 --> 01:37:48.870]  They have to say no to serve under a dictator.
[01:37:49.591 --> 01:37:56.532]  And I think this judge has prejudiced himself by coming out and saying they basically need to
[01:37:57.572 --> 01:38:05.676]  Well, no, they make up their own rules.
[01:38:06.856 --> 01:38:13.679]  They make up their rules to say that actually the military can do anything they want to, and you have to follow their orders.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.180]  That's flat out wrong.
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:17.081]  That's flat out wrong.
[01:38:17.541 --> 01:38:23.504]  You know, we have, in our democracy, we have to be, we have to have people say that things are going wrong.
[01:38:23.784 --> 01:38:26.185]  We have to have soldiers say something has gone wrong.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:32.786]  Um, if you don't, you're going to have, you know, a total military dictatorship.
[01:38:33.066 --> 01:38:34.687]  And that's something we cannot have.
[01:38:34.948 --> 01:38:39.812]  How long until this court-martial plays itself out, Robert Watada?
[01:38:41.133 --> 01:38:44.877]  It's expected to end in about Thursday or Friday of this week.
[01:38:45.477 --> 01:38:52.684]  I think what's going to happen today is that the prosecution is going to put on its case, and then Wednesday the defense will put on its case, and then
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:39:00.602]  Either Thursday or Friday they'll go into sentencing and that's where we'll be able to put in some arguments about why Aaron took the stand that he did.
[01:39:00.622 --> 01:39:06.884]  Well, I'll tell you, they're going to make a martyr out of him if they send him to the brig, but he's ready to go, isn't he?
[01:39:08.184 --> 01:39:09.005]  He's ready to go.
[01:39:09.405 --> 01:39:13.346]  He said that if that's what it takes to stop the killing, then he'll do that.
[01:39:15.406 --> 01:39:19.628]  Because what is going on, as you said in Iraq, is just so wrong.
[01:39:19.808 --> 01:39:20.708]  So terribly wrong.
[01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:23.201]  Uh, killing innocent men, women, and children.
[01:39:23.221 --> 01:39:25.273]  The plundering, the torture, the rape.
[01:39:26.295 --> 01:39:30.236]  It's just wrong, and we as a country cannot allow that to continue.
[01:39:30.336 --> 01:39:40.899]  You know, it just came out in major British papers that what we already knew, Ray McGovern and others are on record saying clearly our government, the British and the Israelis, are staging terror attacks in Iraq.
[01:39:41.239 --> 01:39:47.221]  Well, now they've caught a special forces group of British that are actually recruiting insurgents to carry out attacks.
[01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:51.843]  I mean, they want that place to be a civil war as a pretext to stay there.
[01:39:51.903 --> 01:39:53.003]  Gentlemen, you want to comment on that?
[01:39:54.266 --> 01:39:55.786]  Well, of course.
[01:39:55.806 --> 01:39:57.867]  They shoot the Sunnis and bring the Shiites.
[01:39:58.007 --> 01:40:02.308]  They now have the Kurds going in there to fight the Sunnis.
[01:40:02.428 --> 01:40:04.329]  They want this civil war to go on.
[01:40:04.349 --> 01:40:05.929]  Absolutely.
[01:40:05.949 --> 01:40:08.610]  Because they need that as a pretext for getting a hold of the oil.
[01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:09.670]  Exactly.
[01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:14.633]  Well, I think that the strategy is the U.S.
[01:40:14.673 --> 01:40:17.756]  realized they couldn't deal with a united Iraq.
[01:40:17.796 --> 01:40:19.217]  They couldn't defeat a united Iraq.
[01:40:19.658 --> 01:40:25.303]  So they're just tricking the Iraqis into killing each other off just to prevent them from uniting against the invader.
[01:40:25.664 --> 01:40:27.766]  And it's divide and conquer all over again.
[01:40:27.866 --> 01:40:29.688]  And yes, it's a pretext to conquer the oil.
[01:40:30.068 --> 01:40:32.991]  It's a pretext to establish the beachhead for a wider war.
[01:40:33.271 --> 01:40:34.471]  Yeah, the permanent bases.
[01:40:34.792 --> 01:40:38.173]  And it's in the PNAG documents, it's in the P20G documents.
[01:40:38.593 --> 01:40:46.976]  We know that Brzezinski calls it the Global Balkans, and so feeding our troops in is just a pretext to stay there and keep the war going.
[01:40:47.296 --> 01:40:49.637]  It's needless killing of Iraqis and our troops.
[01:40:50.257 --> 01:40:51.357]  Mr. Wattata comments?
[01:40:52.778 --> 01:40:59.500]  That's exactly what I've been saying, is that there is really no need for us to be there, other than for the
[01:41:00.382 --> 01:41:06.188]  You know, the corporate greed of the oil barons, wanting to get all the oil.
[01:41:06.608 --> 01:41:10.532]  Not for us, but so they can increase the prices and make larger profits.
[01:41:10.672 --> 01:41:13.135]  And Michael Rivera, what does Israel get out of this?
[01:41:13.675 --> 01:41:17.980]  I mean, they don't want to deal with these nations, they want to obliterate them.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.042]  I mean, is that all Israel gets out of it?
[01:41:21.090 --> 01:41:39.182]  No, Israel also gets access to oil, because for the longest time, when the Shah of Iran was still in control there, there was a huge pipeline that went all the way across the Mideast and wound up at Haifa, which was used as a shipping terminal, and Israel was basically able to take out all of its oil needs from that pipeline.
[01:41:39.563 --> 01:41:41.224]  They've been rebuilding that in Iraq.
[01:41:41.949 --> 01:41:48.475]  Yeah, they have been rebuilding it, and Israel is securing their access to oil in the region as well.
[01:41:48.855 --> 01:41:57.723]  The other part of it, of course, is Israel is seeking to expand its territory and to basically render its neighboring nations incapable of resisting.
[01:41:58.163 --> 01:42:04.929]  Although, as you point out, last summer's war in Lebanon was definitely an eye-opener for the reality of Israel's warfighting machine.
[01:42:07.285 --> 01:42:12.188]  Robert, what are your son Aaron's spirits like right now?
[01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:15.529]  You know, he's very strong.
[01:42:16.050 --> 01:42:21.232]  He continues to get a lot of support from soldiers right here at Fort Lewis.
[01:42:21.893 --> 01:42:25.655]  They're all telling him that, you know, thank you very much for doing this for us.
[01:42:26.695 --> 01:42:35.520]  Because it's the same thing that they want to do, but you know, they've got families and other things to be concerned about, but they're really thankful that Aaron is taking this stand.
[01:42:36.139 --> 01:42:41.802]  And they're hoping that his taking of the stand publicly will bring the war to a close much sooner.
[01:42:43.963 --> 01:42:45.063]  Amazing!
[01:42:45.144 --> 01:42:46.664]  They threatened him, didn't they?
[01:42:46.684 --> 01:42:51.146]  That if he didn't shut his mouth before the trial, they would just keep putting more charges on him?
[01:42:52.387 --> 01:42:54.288]  Tell us about that.
[01:42:54.308 --> 01:42:55.669]  They want him to shut up.
[01:42:56.009 --> 01:42:58.870]  They don't want him to say anything about what is going on in Iraq.
[01:42:59.831 --> 01:43:02.232]  But of course we all know what's going on in Iraq now.
[01:43:04.975 --> 01:43:07.175]  So we should know by Thursday or Friday?
[01:43:07.876 --> 01:43:09.436]  Yes, we should know by Thursday or Friday.
[01:43:10.036 --> 01:43:13.537]  So, hopefully, maybe next week we can get back and talk to you again.
[01:43:14.437 --> 01:43:24.539]  And again, just to be clear, and we're going to let you go because we know you're very busy, this whole process, why did your son decide to say, no, I'm not going to Iraq?
[01:43:24.639 --> 01:43:29.640]  I mean, you told us last time it was just talking to those that had come back about how evil it was.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:30.660]  Is that accurate to say?
[01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:33.771]  Well, that's part of it.
[01:43:33.991 --> 01:43:40.334]  Of course, he did his own research and he found out that there was not only deception, but clearly lying by the commander.
[01:43:40.394 --> 01:43:45.477]  Now, if your boss lied to you and put you out on the line so that you can get killed, what would you do?
[01:43:46.137 --> 01:43:48.098]  You know, you're not going to walk out there.
[01:43:48.578 --> 01:43:49.739]  And this is what Aaron is saying.
[01:43:49.779 --> 01:43:53.121]  Hey, look, our commander lied and he's lying to the people.
[01:43:53.721 --> 01:44:01.325]  And, you know, we, the soldiers, cannot go out there and put our lives at risk for the oil burns.
[01:44:03.610 --> 01:44:05.071]  Well, we should all pray for your son.
[01:44:05.091 --> 01:44:06.772]  We'll pray for you and your family as well.
[01:44:06.872 --> 01:44:08.993]  It's ThankYouLT.org.
[01:44:09.053 --> 01:44:10.894]  ThankYouLieutenant.org.
[01:44:10.914 --> 01:44:13.055]  We've got links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:44:13.075 --> 01:44:19.078]  I know you're very busy, but I'd like to be able to get you up for a five, ten minute report in the aftermath Thursday or Friday, sir.
[01:44:19.918 --> 01:44:21.099]  Okay, thank you very much.
[01:44:21.379 --> 01:44:23.300]  And thanks to Michael also.
[01:44:24.041 --> 01:44:24.561]  Thank you.
[01:44:24.601 --> 01:44:24.921]  Bye now.
[01:44:25.241 --> 01:44:25.681]  Take care.
[01:44:25.781 --> 01:44:26.422]  Thank you, Bob.
[01:44:26.502 --> 01:44:26.902]  Good luck.
[01:44:27.282 --> 01:44:28.783]  I wanted to get that update from him.
[01:44:29.543 --> 01:44:32.405]  Any other closing comments on that subject before we go to some calls, Mike?
[01:44:33.837 --> 01:44:40.865]  Yeah, basically one of the points that the court-martial is trying to make is that it is up to the president to determine if a war is legal or not.
[01:44:41.325 --> 01:44:51.638]  But that absolutely flies in the face of common sense, because when Hitler was ordering his troops to do all that they did, he never stopped and said, by the way, what you're about to do is illegal and a crime, but I want you to do it anyway.
[01:44:52.178 --> 01:44:52.939]  So the oath
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:56.382]  I just thought of another key facet to all of this.
[01:44:56.402 --> 01:45:00.145]  Remember two years ago, a private interrogator hired and ordered to torture people?
[01:45:00.165 --> 01:45:03.328]  Tortured some people at Bagram Air Base to death?
[01:45:16.062 --> 01:45:24.873]  And there were cases in Afghanistan, similar cases in Iraq, and when he brought forward the documents that he was ordered to do it, they used the Patriot Act to gag him.
[01:45:25.254 --> 01:45:29.899]  We know that they ordered the individuals at Abu Ghraib and the Camp X-Ray and other places to torture people.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:34.345]  That's now come out in the White House, Gonzalez and John Yoo and presidential memos.
[01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:45.466]  But then the presidency basically ordered the Pentagon to send people who followed criminal orders, and I agree they're culpable, but not as culpable as the Mafia Don that sent them out to do the crimes.
[01:45:45.806 --> 01:45:50.409]  So another thing, and these troops need to know, if you get caught doing this illegal stuff, you're going to go to prison!
[01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:55.872]  Yeah, there is no loyalty coming back down that chain of command.
[01:45:56.012 --> 01:45:56.732]  Absolutely not.
[01:45:58.313 --> 01:45:58.853]  It's unbelievable.
[01:45:58.893 --> 01:46:03.376]  I mean, they were ordered to do that torture, and then they send the people to prison that did it when they get caught.
[01:46:04.875 --> 01:46:10.217]  I mean that is, and then the President says we don't torture when there's a hundred speeches with him and his minions saying we torture.
[01:46:11.277 --> 01:46:14.538]  Well you need to look back about two years before all this started when the U.S.
[01:46:14.578 --> 01:46:19.600]  was going to all these other countries and saying we want to be exempted from war crimes prosecution at the Hague.
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:27.622]  They were pushing real hard for that and at the time my theory was if they're trying to get immunity from war crimes it's because they're planning to commit some.
[01:46:28.690 --> 01:46:29.391]  No kidding.
[01:46:30.252 --> 01:46:53.511]  I remember just months after 9-11, there was a CIA section chief from the Middle East in the Washington Post, I put it in my film Road to Tyranny, screenshot of it, saying, we aren't just torturing, quote, insurgents, we're torturing their family members in front of them in third-party countries like Jordan and Egypt.
[01:46:53.772 --> 01:46:55.213]  And then now, of course, all that came out.
[01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.509]  Yeah.
[01:46:56.770 --> 01:46:58.631]  So, this is just off the charts evil.
[01:46:59.451 --> 01:47:00.812]  Let's take calls here.
[01:47:00.913 --> 01:47:02.894]  John in Texas, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[01:47:02.914 --> 01:47:07.357]  Okay, he's not there.
[01:47:08.498 --> 01:47:11.140]  Sean in Mass, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:12.461]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:13.682]  Thanks for holding, what's on your mind?
[01:47:13.982 --> 01:47:23.469]  Well, I'm talking about Berkshire 9-11 truth up here in Great Barrington, Mass, and Governor Kaine came to the local high school last night to speak, and we kind of embarrassed him.
[01:47:24.846 --> 01:47:35.228]  I got thrown out immediately for coming in with a sign that said whitewash on it by the police because they wouldn't stand a free speech zone and they didn't appreciate the sign.
[01:47:36.148 --> 01:47:46.670]  Then some people from our group waited for him to start speaking and then got up and started yelling, cover up, cover up, cover up, and then they were escorted out.
[01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:52.091]  By the way, everywhere Keene goes, the head of the Whitewash Commission, that happens.
[01:47:54.344 --> 01:48:11.957]  Yeah, it's important for people to continue to do this because yes, you will get escorted out, you'll be told you have to stay in the free speech zone, but it does wreck that illusion that the government is trying to maintain that only a few people doubt the official story about 9-11 and how we got into the wars in Iraq.
[01:48:12.378 --> 01:48:16.301]  So when everybody is standing up at every speech and yelling
[01:48:17.435 --> 01:48:28.948]  Well by an excrement or something similar at the people who are speaking, it's getting to be a public embarrassment and pretty soon they're going to realize they have utterly failed to control the flow of information.
[01:48:28.968 --> 01:48:37.477]  Well, Sandy Sheehan with that one demonstration right after the Democrats got in and didn't bring the war up or getting the troops out, they shut that
[01:48:38.958 --> 01:48:49.322]  I mean, I think that's one of the biggest stories is the fact that how utterly the Democrats sold out.
[01:48:49.362 --> 01:48:53.404]  They were already bought and paid for, so I guess they didn't sell out.
[01:48:53.444 --> 01:48:55.705]  They were already on the payroll.
[01:48:56.645 --> 01:48:59.487]  But, you know, some of the Democrats I know have now gone back to sleep.
[01:48:59.767 --> 01:49:00.867]  They think everything's fine.
[01:49:01.047 --> 01:49:02.508]  World War III is about to start!
[01:49:04.113 --> 01:49:12.316]  Yeah, I sometimes wonder about those congressional staffers that work in their office, if these people are really doing their job to keep the congressman informed about what's going on.
[01:49:12.916 --> 01:49:25.080]  In fact, those staffers are part of the problem, and their real goal is to keep the congressman just sort of happy and contented and taken care of and pampered so that they're not likely to get in the way of what's really going to happen.
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:26.920]  Well, congressmen have written books about that.
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:32.482]  A lot of the chief staffers are more powerful than the congresspeople, and they're there being paid off by the lobbyists to write the legislation.
[01:49:33.354 --> 01:49:34.294]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:34.314 --> 01:49:49.240]  And of course, getting back to the lobbies, it gets all the way back to that AIPAC situation, which donates millions of dollars to congressional candidates and carries with it that threat that if you don't toe the Israeli line, we will fund your opponent next election and you will be out of a job.
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.901]  And that is why we have lost control of our country.
[01:49:52.001 --> 01:49:56.563]  And if we don't get it back, we're going to spend the rest of our lives fighting wars against
[01:49:57.143 --> 01:49:58.205]  Uh, Israel's enemies.
[01:49:58.545 --> 01:50:02.851]  Sean, you've got the last minute and a half here before we go to break, and come back and take more calls.
[01:50:02.891 --> 01:50:03.352]  Anything else?
[01:50:03.372 --> 01:50:04.633]  No, that was all, Alex.
[01:50:04.673 --> 01:50:05.554]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:50:05.795 --> 01:50:06.215]  Thank you.
[01:50:06.295 --> 01:50:07.136]  Chris in Florida.
[01:50:07.156 --> 01:50:07.757]  You're on the air.
[01:50:07.817 --> 01:50:08.258]  Go ahead.
[01:50:08.278 --> 01:50:10.381]  Hi, Alex.
[01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:10.841]  How are you?
[01:50:11.001 --> 01:50:11.322]  Good, sir.
[01:50:12.436 --> 01:50:14.297]  Uh, just wanted to briefly comment.
[01:50:14.337 --> 01:50:15.257]  Love your show today.
[01:50:15.277 --> 01:50:17.138]  Wanted to briefly comment on Terror Storm.
[01:50:17.598 --> 01:50:18.479]  You got my order.
[01:50:18.559 --> 01:50:20.299]  I got my DVDs fast.
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:31.384]  Uh, the DVD Terror Storm, uh, if I didn't know any better, I would think that CNN had been freed from control and it made a documentary.
[01:50:31.484 --> 01:50:32.764]  It's so outstanding.
[01:50:32.924 --> 01:50:33.885]  Very professional.
[01:50:33.925 --> 01:50:35.565]  I can't say enough good things about it.
[01:50:36.086 --> 01:50:39.447]  It's going out to all my local radio show hosts who've been dumbed down.
[01:50:40.206 --> 01:50:46.670]  And that's an important thing, to slowly work on these radio stations, folks, and get these copies out to different people.
[01:50:47.710 --> 01:50:53.553]  Well, I mean, the power of you, the listeners, taking action is what's going to save this country and this world.
[01:50:53.953 --> 01:50:58.996]  And Mike, you hear this recurring theme with my listeners, the best in the world, they're out there taking action.
[01:51:00.637 --> 01:51:06.080]  Yeah, I think it's time to get active and it's time to let yourself become angry.
[01:51:08.665 --> 01:51:09.226]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:51:09.986 --> 01:51:24.192]  When you get back on this subject again, about the Praetorian Guard, or excuse me, the Blackwater group, I saw the author Jeremy Scahill on Free Speech TV, and I was wondering if you'd ever had him on any of your shows.
[01:51:24.212 --> 01:51:24.952]  Well, stay there.
[01:51:25.112 --> 01:51:28.814]  Let me let you finish, Chris, after the quick break, talk about Blackwater.
[01:51:29.134 --> 01:51:29.794]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:35.626 --> 01:51:36.087]  It's here.
[01:51:36.307 --> 01:51:41.053]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:41.434 --> 01:51:49.104]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:49.784 --> 01:51:56.827]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:57.227 --> 01:52:08.631]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:08.951 --> 01:52:12.492]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:12.933 --> 01:52:14.853]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:15.173 --> 01:52:19.015]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:32.418 --> 01:52:33.179]  Terrorism!
[01:52:33.339 --> 01:52:34.099]  Terrorism!
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:40.244]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:52:40.505 --> 01:52:42.086]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:52:42.346 --> 01:52:44.828]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:52:45.208 --> 01:52:59.780]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:00.120]  government.
[01:53:00.321 --> 01:53:02.042]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:53:02.482 --> 01:53:08.386]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:53:08.526 --> 01:53:13.008]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:54:49.893 --> 01:54:55.894]  Michael Rivero is our guest.
[01:54:55.955 --> 01:55:01.676]  He's going to have about five minutes to the next hour with us.
[01:55:02.116 --> 01:55:04.057]  Then Nancy Kornke joins us.
[01:55:14.085 --> 01:55:18.928]  The wife of Mark from Michigan will tell you about his upcoming release from prison on false charges.
[01:55:28.274 --> 01:55:32.558]  Forced inoculation with a live cancer virus, but it's not really a forced inoculation.
[01:55:32.578 --> 01:55:35.701]  The media, the governor, and the whole country's media are just lying.
[01:55:36.702 --> 01:55:38.203]  Let's go back to Chris in Florida.
[01:55:38.303 --> 01:55:41.666]  Finish up your point, sir, about Blackwater and private mercs.
[01:55:42.286 --> 01:55:43.848]  Yes, this is C.H.
[01:55:43.908 --> 01:55:44.749]  in Florida, Alex.
[01:55:46.150 --> 01:55:55.358]  I had seen author Jeremy Scahill on a free speech TV, and he was talking about his new book, Blackwater, The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army.
[01:55:56.181 --> 01:55:59.442]  And he used that term, that Bush is private praetorian guard.
[01:55:59.562 --> 01:56:01.263]  I mean, this is such pure evil.
[01:56:01.763 --> 01:56:07.705]  And I was just calling to suggest him as a guest in the future, and wondering if you'd had him on as a guest in the past.
[01:56:07.805 --> 01:56:08.145]  That's all.
[01:56:08.405 --> 01:56:09.145]  Yeah, I might do that.
[01:56:09.185 --> 01:56:09.746]  I've heard of him.
[01:56:09.786 --> 01:56:10.526]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:10.566 --> 01:56:13.767]  Michael Rivero comments on the rise of mercs.
[01:56:15.247 --> 01:56:22.830]  Well, the danger there for Americans is that private security is not held to the same standards of conduct
[01:56:23.254 --> 01:56:30.180]  as civil police or or even the military and it also gives the controlling authority a certain amount of deniability.
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:34.363]  Oh, we didn't order those people to go in and burn down that church for the women and children.
[01:56:34.383 --> 01:56:38.346]  They just got carried away and we're going to terminate their contract just to teach them a lesson.
[01:56:39.047 --> 01:56:46.052]  And so it basically allows these kind of impressions or rather repressions to continue with impunity.
[01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:49.715]  And I see these as a real threat to the civil liberties of America.
[01:56:50.231 --> 01:57:04.201]  Well, not only do we see a shift to Mercs and a shift to private police now, we also see 20% of the ground force in Iraq not even being American citizens, a major announcement to increase the recruitment from the Philippines to Mexico.
[01:57:04.221 --> 01:57:10.505]  I mean, this is all the classical signs of a very degenerate empire.
[01:57:11.881 --> 01:57:19.891]  Very much so, and of course all of these non-citizens who are being recruited does two things.
[01:57:20.091 --> 01:57:21.493]  First of all, I think
[01:57:22.176 --> 01:57:32.078]  That it allows the government to more easily conceal the true numbers of combat deaths in Iraq, which, again, we saw this during Vietnam.
[01:57:32.118 --> 01:57:36.059]  We didn't really find out how many Americans had died in the war until after it was already over.
[01:57:36.179 --> 01:57:43.461]  Well, there were troops dying from 59 to 64 before they made it more official, and that was what, like 7,000 troops died?
[01:57:43.481 --> 01:57:44.641]  They kept that many secret?
[01:57:45.421 --> 01:57:47.041]  Yeah, they absolutely did.
[01:57:47.161 --> 01:57:49.322]  The real numbers did not become known until enough
[01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:58.394]  People have been killed that the family started networking and knew each other and said, well, if we all have lost somebody, then obviously the numbers can't be right.
[01:57:58.475 --> 01:57:59.755]  I mean, is that a free country?
[01:57:59.815 --> 01:58:02.577]  Is that a good government where they've been lying to us this long?
[01:58:02.797 --> 01:58:06.919]  And I mean, how do we just accept lying by both parties like it's okay?
[01:58:08.246 --> 01:58:09.647]  Well, I certainly don't accept it.
[01:58:09.688 --> 01:58:12.991]  That's the whole reason for my website and for radio shows like yours.
[01:58:13.752 --> 01:58:20.899]  My opinion is that since the Constitution does not allow the government to lie to us, that a government that lies is illegal and unconstitutional.
[01:58:21.379 --> 01:58:26.965]  And that we are obligated as citizens to refuse to obey its dictates or even to pay its bills.
[01:58:29.065 --> 01:58:29.725]  Absolutely.
[01:58:29.745 --> 01:58:45.134]  We're going to break here and have a final segment with you, Michael Rivero, and we'll go to Steve in Texas, Todd in Ohio, Chris in Texas, I've got John in California, and many others, but we do have Nancy Kornke joining us, but we will get to those calls after she's with us for about 20-30 minutes.
[01:58:45.934 --> 01:58:57.360]  There's so many other things happening, it's just, it makes the head spin, and to witness this level of corruption, and both parties colluding, something's got to give sometime, doesn't it Mike?
[01:58:58.402 --> 01:59:00.765]  Yeah, there's a crisis coming somewhere.
[01:59:00.805 --> 01:59:08.413]  I don't know exactly where or when, but it's nonsense to think that things are going to continue as they are for any great amount of time.
[01:59:08.714 --> 01:59:10.355]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:59:12.278 --> 01:59:17.183]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:59:22.529 --> 01:59:27.612]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:59:27.672 --> 01:59:34.995]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:59:35.135 --> 01:59:45.761]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:59:45.981 --> 01:59:50.503]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:59:50.803 --> 01:59:56.045]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-parts of nutritional matter that your body needs.
[01:59:56.265 --> 02:00:06.150]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:00:06.170 --> 02:00:10.932]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:00:22.279 --> 02:00:24.179]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:27.540]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:33.982 --> 02:00:34.642]  Big Brother.
[02:00:35.282 --> 02:00:36.362]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:38.203]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:38.823 --> 02:00:39.643]  You want answers?
[02:00:40.403 --> 02:00:42.324]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:42.344 --> 02:00:45.625]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:46.145 --> 02:00:50.246]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:51.969 --> 02:01:00.841]  Lieutenant Aaron Wachada may become a political prisoner on Thursday or Friday with his court marshalling for not going to an illegal war and calling the President dishonest.
[02:01:01.883 --> 02:01:03.946]  He's a dishonest puppet is what he is.
[02:01:05.331 --> 02:01:08.472]  And Mark Harkey has been a political prisoner for almost seven years.
[02:01:08.532 --> 02:01:09.572]  His wife will be joining us.
[02:01:09.952 --> 02:01:12.092]  He should be getting out of prison soon, in March.
[02:01:12.512 --> 02:01:15.293]  We'll be talking to her and getting her take on a lot of important issues.
[02:01:16.473 --> 02:01:20.014]  The man from WhatReallyHappened.com joins us, Michael Rivero.
[02:01:20.114 --> 02:01:21.494]  Great analysis, great reports.
[02:01:21.974 --> 02:01:24.035]  New one-hour news program.
[02:01:24.375 --> 02:01:25.555]  Been out for about a month now.
[02:01:25.895 --> 02:01:29.476]  Right here on Genesis, Saturday mornings at 11 a.m.
[02:01:29.536 --> 02:01:29.896]  Central.
[02:01:30.476 --> 02:01:32.398]  Right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:32.418 --> 02:01:35.320]  We'll be focusing on APEC and its undue influence this Saturday.
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:37.802]  Quickly, three final calls for our guest.
[02:01:38.202 --> 02:01:39.824]  Steve in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:01:40.724 --> 02:01:41.345]  Well, hi Alex.
[02:01:42.206 --> 02:01:43.106]  Come on sir.
[02:01:43.807 --> 02:01:48.691]  I was over at the talk that you gave over at the University of Texas the other night.
[02:01:49.251 --> 02:01:51.273]  You had 900 people and 100 turned away.
[02:01:52.336 --> 02:01:59.859]  It was totally awesome, and thanks for dispersing that DVD that had extra stuff on it.
[02:02:00.639 --> 02:02:01.219]  We watched it.
[02:02:01.459 --> 02:02:05.621]  That was listeners there giving out free films, everybody, but that was a nice thing, but I can't take credit.
[02:02:06.261 --> 02:02:06.661]  Oh, okay.
[02:02:06.881 --> 02:02:07.161]  All right.
[02:02:07.921 --> 02:02:08.602]  I stand corrected.
[02:02:08.822 --> 02:02:11.703]  Well, we did give them permission to do it, but I'm not going to take credit for their good work.
[02:02:12.403 --> 02:02:14.223]  Yeah, well, they're awesome.
[02:02:14.243 --> 02:02:17.224]  You come to a free speech and you get free films.
[02:02:18.025 --> 02:02:21.626]  Yeah, well, hey, I love that free speech area there.
[02:02:22.290 --> 02:02:23.451]  That was really cool.
[02:02:24.533 --> 02:02:29.278]  Regarding Iran and these, what, three battle groups are going over there now?
[02:02:29.799 --> 02:02:39.290]  Well, there's four different naval task forces, two mainline carriers, and then two Coronado-class mini-aircraft carriers.
[02:02:39.370 --> 02:02:40.211]  Mike, is that accurate?
[02:02:40.231 --> 02:02:40.912]  I'm going from memory.
[02:02:41.676 --> 02:02:44.338]  No, that's pretty much accurate.
[02:02:44.518 --> 02:02:45.939]  They're considered assault craft.
[02:02:45.999 --> 02:02:53.485]  They're short aircraft carrier decks, but they also have deployment facilities for things like hovercraft and landing craft.
[02:02:54.085 --> 02:02:54.866]  I've got a question.
[02:02:56.107 --> 02:02:57.067]  Well, a comment and a question.
[02:02:58.589 --> 02:03:04.513]  I'm thinking about, you know, back to Pearl Harbor when they pulled all the aircraft carriers out of there and left those old ships to get bombed.
[02:03:06.314 --> 02:03:09.877]  I'm thinking with, you know, all this information about the sunburn,
[02:03:10.569 --> 02:03:10.689]  Yes.
[02:03:27.006 --> 02:03:36.570]  Yeah, what happens if an aircraft carrier and a couple of support ships get hit by a bunch of sunburns or silkworms and all these different arsenals?
[02:03:37.290 --> 02:03:42.873]  Then we're off to the races, the USS Maine, the Lusitania, the Gulf of Tonkin, the USS Liberty, Mike?
[02:03:43.973 --> 02:03:44.914]  Yeah, very much.
[02:03:45.294 --> 02:03:53.357]  A lot of people are saying that the sinking of an American warship would be the justification to declare war and go into Iran.
[02:03:53.617 --> 02:03:55.498]  That's another one of the scenarios that's been discussed.
[02:03:56.039 --> 02:04:15.110]  And along with the various missiles, of course, Iran is reported to have a Russian development called the Underwater Rocket, and this is a rocket-powered torpedo that puts a sheath of bubbles in the water around itself to cut friction, and it's amazingly fast.
[02:04:16.037 --> 02:04:19.519]  And our current defenses can't really work against it.
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:23.342]  So if a submarine were to get close to the U.S.
[02:04:23.382 --> 02:04:27.344]  fleet and sink a ship, that could very easily be blamed on Iran as well.
[02:04:27.424 --> 02:04:32.067]  Can you imagine the news images of an aircraft carrier on fire with its magazine exploding?
[02:04:34.048 --> 02:04:37.671]  It would be a very spectacular news footage and it would be waved all over.
[02:04:37.831 --> 02:04:41.895]  So I'm very worried about all of our people we have in the region on those ships.
[02:04:42.355 --> 02:04:49.161]  I actually have family on one of the destroyers that just departed Hawaii to support the Reagan.
[02:04:49.221 --> 02:04:50.482]  So, you know, we're concerned.
[02:04:51.142 --> 02:04:52.363]  Yeah, thank you for the call.
[02:04:52.544 --> 02:04:53.825]  I will give the other callers later.
[02:04:53.865 --> 02:04:57.428]  Michael Rivero, thank you for coming on once a month and giving us your insights.
[02:04:58.408 --> 02:05:00.230]  My pleasure and look forward to doing it again.
[02:05:00.862 --> 02:05:01.342]  Take care.
[02:05:01.362 --> 02:05:02.543]  All right, folks.
[02:05:02.563 --> 02:05:09.265]  The websites are WhatReallyHappened.com, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com.
[02:05:09.585 --> 02:05:15.047]  It's up to you to email those out, to post them on message boards, to put them on MySpace, and to reach even more people.
[02:05:15.207 --> 02:05:19.328]  Help us end this fight in our desperate attempt to stop World War III.
[02:05:19.748 --> 02:05:23.510]  And even if they launch it, we didn't need to let everybody know who was behind it and what really happened.
[02:05:23.630 --> 02:05:24.190]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:33.152]  It's here!
[02:05:33.372 --> 02:05:38.116]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:38.496 --> 02:05:46.143]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:46.829 --> 02:05:53.892]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:54.293 --> 02:06:05.678]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police fortune, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:06.018 --> 02:06:09.540]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:11.921]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:12.241 --> 02:06:16.083]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:29.295 --> 02:06:32.316]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:06:32.616 --> 02:06:37.538]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:06:37.798 --> 02:06:42.159]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:51.363]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:06:51.583 --> 02:06:55.184]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:06:55.484 --> 02:07:00.509]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:07:00.809 --> 02:07:07.555]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:07:08.015 --> 02:07:08.556]  What about you?
[02:07:09.318 --> 02:07:14.661]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:07:15.901 --> 02:07:17.782]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:07:29.119 --> 02:07:30.039]  Shelly, you look exhausted!
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:30.820]  Oh, wait!
[02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:32.060]  Why did you turn that down?
[02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:34.681]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[02:07:35.161 --> 02:07:39.643]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[02:07:39.823 --> 02:07:42.264]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[02:07:42.524 --> 02:07:43.705]  I could use something like that.
[02:07:43.725 --> 02:07:46.146]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[02:07:46.286 --> 02:07:49.187]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[02:07:49.227 --> 02:07:51.047]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[02:07:51.147 --> 02:07:53.408]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[02:07:53.788 --> 02:07:54.409]  I guess you're right.
[02:07:54.789 --> 02:07:55.489]  Why don't we try it?
[02:07:55.649 --> 02:07:57.610]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[02:07:58.030 --> 02:08:02.431]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[02:08:02.751 --> 02:08:04.091]  I know where we can get some more information.
[02:08:04.471 --> 02:08:08.852]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[02:08:09.092 --> 02:08:12.373]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[02:08:12.613 --> 02:08:15.754]  With our 30-day, 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[02:08:16.134 --> 02:08:16.994]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[02:08:17.234 --> 02:08:18.494]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[02:08:18.694 --> 02:08:19.974]  The BedFan is the answer.
[02:08:20.234 --> 02:08:23.595]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[02:08:23.875 --> 02:08:26.596]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[02:08:26.736 --> 02:08:27.476]  That's bed.
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:34.841]  Big Brother.
[02:08:35.501 --> 02:08:36.582]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:37.282 --> 02:08:38.403]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:39.043 --> 02:08:39.864]  You want answers?
[02:08:40.604 --> 02:08:42.526]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:42.546 --> 02:08:45.808]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:46.368 --> 02:08:50.431]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:52.791 --> 02:08:59.340]  We are now 8 minutes and 25 seconds into the third and final hour of this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[02:08:59.761 --> 02:09:08.193]  The bottom of the hour will continue blitzing through your phone calls and covering some international and national news that we have not gotten to yet.
[02:09:09.585 --> 02:09:11.526]  But it's important to look at political prisoners.
[02:09:11.606 --> 02:09:24.592]  We talked to Robert Wattada of Hawaii, whose son Aaron Wattada has been court-martialed for saying he won't go to Iraq after he's already served several years as an officer because it's an illegal war and the president's dishonest.
[02:09:25.092 --> 02:09:26.773]  Probably about to become a political prisoner.
[02:09:27.233 --> 02:09:38.539]  Mark Gregory Kornke served in the Army, honorably discharged, and he worked at a major university as their chief of maintenance.
[02:09:39.159 --> 02:09:45.489]  He, of course, was Mark from Michigan calling it a talk radio in the early 90s, getting his own show in the early 1990s.
[02:09:45.969 --> 02:09:54.222]  He and others were involved in founding some of the first Patriot Radio programs and networks, and I learned a lot from Mark Kornke.
[02:09:55.186 --> 02:10:12.684]  I was doing a local show here weeknights and had Mark and others on as guests and then I got hooked up with a little network that they were on and reached a lot of people and that really over time grew into what you hear and see today with our work and Mark got set up
[02:10:14.075 --> 02:10:20.139]  With a little minion of the ADL coming to his house, threatening people.
[02:10:20.159 --> 02:10:24.721]  They basically just, from the story, pushed him off the steps of the house and said, get out of here.
[02:10:25.382 --> 02:10:26.963]  Then the police came after Mark.
[02:10:27.043 --> 02:10:29.184]  Someone told Mark where his location was.
[02:10:30.424 --> 02:10:31.725]  And they later bragged about it.
[02:10:32.586 --> 02:10:34.707]  And we still deal with that problem today.
[02:10:35.587 --> 02:10:40.070]  And Mark then, a year or so later, and I have the squad car video.
[02:10:40.735 --> 02:10:42.516]  And I just thought to get Nancy on yesterday.
[02:10:42.556 --> 02:10:43.436]  I called Nancy.
[02:10:43.576 --> 02:10:44.696]  I looked around last night.
[02:10:44.736 --> 02:10:45.456]  I can't find it.
[02:10:45.797 --> 02:10:49.038]  I know Mike Hanson, who's out in Gonzales right now, has it.
[02:10:49.358 --> 02:10:50.858]  But in the future, we're going to dig it out.
[02:10:51.038 --> 02:10:53.079]  If we can't find it, Nancy will send it to me again.
[02:10:53.459 --> 02:10:54.779]  That needs to be put on YouTube.
[02:10:54.799 --> 02:10:55.820]  But what am I talking about?
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:00.501]  There is a little bank that Mark Banks said.
[02:11:00.661 --> 02:11:01.181]  He goes.
[02:11:01.381 --> 02:11:03.862]  He's on the surveillance camera, dropping in their deposit.
[02:11:05.774 --> 02:11:07.335]  He'd been moving furniture around.
[02:11:07.355 --> 02:11:11.878]  He dropped off the rental truck, got his car, had one of his sons in the car with him.
[02:11:11.898 --> 02:11:12.599]  This has been years.
[02:11:12.639 --> 02:11:14.400]  Nancy can fill me in if my memory's failing.
[02:11:16.041 --> 02:11:17.482]  And fill in any other details.
[02:11:18.462 --> 02:11:32.852]  And then we have over an hour of squad car audio as the sheriff's deputy is told to, uh, that Mark Kornke's driving down a certain road and to get behind Mark Kornke.
[02:11:33.948 --> 02:11:39.695]  Then it came out that it was someone who looked nothing like Mark on the tape, who did come in and supposedly rob the bank.
[02:11:40.276 --> 02:11:41.317]  A massive setup.
[02:11:41.417 --> 02:11:44.000]  Same thing that happened to Fritz Springmeier.
[02:11:45.022 --> 02:11:48.406]  They admitted later that Mark had nothing to do with the bank robbery, that he banked there.
[02:11:49.449 --> 02:12:09.765]  Isn't that interesting that right after he drops something off, somebody goes in and robs the bank, and the police are saying, Mark Kornke, Mark Kornke, when he just put it in the side drop box, this individual went in and robbed the bank, and the sheriff's deputy, and this would have been better today if I would have had this, it would have been powerful to play it, is going, well, you don't think it's Mark Kornke, then why am I following him?
[02:12:10.246 --> 02:12:12.187]  And they say, go to cell phone!
[02:12:13.288 --> 02:12:14.109]  You hear the sheriff.
[02:12:15.197 --> 02:12:18.200]  And Mark had his son with him and thought that it was some kind of set up.
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:23.224]  So he basically, uh, sped away down the highway, down some side roads.
[02:12:23.304 --> 02:12:26.546]  All that could have got him all was speeding or maybe reckless driving, but it wasn't reckless.
[02:12:27.147 --> 02:12:30.890]  He dropped his son off, uh, got him out of there.
[02:12:30.930 --> 02:12:34.072]  Then the police cars come up and start ramming his car.
[02:12:34.112 --> 02:12:35.093]  This is all on tape.
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.161]  Mark is not ramming them.
[02:12:37.261 --> 02:12:38.682]  They are ramming him.
[02:12:39.182 --> 02:12:45.706]  He gets out of the car and runs out into a river trying to get away from them.
[02:12:45.726 --> 02:12:47.287]  They drop beads down on him and they get him.
[02:12:48.348 --> 02:12:56.954]  And with the squad car video that I played many times on local access television while Mark's trial was going on, they ram him.
[02:12:57.034 --> 02:12:59.995]  And it's the same thing you see with Abby Newman that happened in 2000.
[02:13:01.616 --> 02:13:08.141]  And it's in Road to Tyranny, where she goes to a checkpoint, state police are searching everybody, they say, we want your license, we want a search, she says no.
[02:13:08.901 --> 02:13:13.805]  They jerk her out, she doesn't even resist, she has her hands at her sides, and they charge her with resisting arrest.
[02:13:15.014 --> 02:13:18.636]  Of course, she got a jury trial and defeated it because we had the squad car video.
[02:13:18.916 --> 02:13:22.557]  Then they get in the back of her car and find Patriot Games, the movie.
[02:13:22.657 --> 02:13:24.738]  I mean, Harrison Ford, and they think that's terrorist.
[02:13:25.038 --> 02:13:27.759]  They find the Pac Constitution, they think that's terrorist.
[02:13:28.019 --> 02:13:29.320]  They say it may be illegal.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:32.841]  They find a Police State 2000 and say, this must be illegal.
[02:13:33.782 --> 02:13:35.082]  I mean, this is their mindset.
[02:13:35.603 --> 02:13:39.924]  So, just like she didn't do anything, didn't even touch him, they still charge her with that.
[02:13:40.265 --> 02:13:41.205]  They ram Mark.
[02:13:41.875 --> 02:14:03.905]  He gets, and he already had the other absconding conviction before, not for pushing the guy off the porch, who was menacing them and his family, but for then absconding, they said he ran from police, and so he already had that, then they get him again, a guy with no record until that time, and they ram him off the road, and then they say he assaulted them with a car.
[02:14:04.286 --> 02:14:05.546]  Nancy, is that accurate?
[02:14:06.567 --> 02:14:07.027]  Pretty much.
[02:14:07.608 --> 02:14:08.068]  Pretty much.
[02:14:08.608 --> 02:14:09.589]  Well, I mean, pretty much.
[02:14:09.609 --> 02:14:10.169]  Fill us in.
[02:14:10.209 --> 02:14:12.109]  I mean, I mean, recap what happened to Mark.
[02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:15.190]  Well, how far back do you want to go here?
[02:14:15.650 --> 02:14:20.992]  But no, he's a name that he will not give to himself as a whistleblower.
[02:14:21.412 --> 02:14:23.592]  And that's something everybody needs to understand.
[02:14:23.632 --> 02:14:33.615]  When he left the military, he had information that was given to him not through, through regular channels that he wanted to investigate and to expose.
[02:14:34.275 --> 02:14:40.958]  Had he been briefed or debriefed properly, he would not have been able to come forward about the concentration camps in the United States.
[02:14:41.798 --> 02:14:44.379]  And that is the root of everything here.
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:53.764]  That the individual you're talking about came forward at that time to quote-unquote help him was something else.
[02:14:54.524 --> 02:15:03.368]  As far as this latest go-round, well, with the first incident with Mr. Gaynor, Gaynor was working with Tom Wayne.
[02:15:04.831 --> 02:15:17.537]  Another talk show host, but a man working with the ADL, and came with a dead subpoena, meaning it was no longer any good, the guy had confessed, and punched Mark with it.
[02:15:18.678 --> 02:15:19.178]  Literally.
[02:15:20.899 --> 02:15:26.381]  By the grace of God, you know, we had people come forward that were there, that were witness to it.
[02:15:26.642 --> 02:15:30.623]  So they had you drop that, but they still got him on the absconding?
[02:15:30.824 --> 02:15:33.745]  They still got him on the absconding, but I had to be able to prove that.
[02:15:34.136 --> 02:15:37.719]  And had he gone to court when it was scheduled, we would not have been able to prove it.
[02:15:38.659 --> 02:15:40.581]  And that was the bottom line.
[02:15:41.381 --> 02:15:42.582]  It wasn't even an acquittal.
[02:15:42.682 --> 02:15:45.645]  They brought the case.
[02:15:45.925 --> 02:15:47.806]  The prosecutor did.
[02:15:47.906 --> 02:15:53.290]  And they wanted him to go to a misdemeanor on that.
[02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:54.471]  And he said, I'm not going to do that.
[02:15:56.292 --> 02:15:57.713]  There was no underlying charge.
[02:15:57.834 --> 02:16:02.417]  His was the first case in the United States where an absconding charge was upheld
[02:16:02.833 --> 02:16:04.794]  When the underlying case was dropped.
[02:16:05.614 --> 02:16:06.375]  First one ever.
[02:16:06.595 --> 02:16:11.877]  And now that's more and more commonplace where the underlying charge is dropped, but then they get you with the stack.
[02:16:12.477 --> 02:16:12.857]  Right.
[02:16:12.937 --> 02:16:19.200]  It's like the Davidians found not guilty of murder when the judge says, I find you guilty of using firearms in the commission of murder.
[02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:23.762]  How were you found guilty of using firearms in the commission of murder when you were found not guilty of murder?
[02:16:24.082 --> 02:16:24.442]  Exactly.
[02:16:24.462 --> 02:16:25.743]  And that's Judge Walter E. Smith.
[02:16:25.763 --> 02:16:30.485]  Now without going into too much detail, of course there's going to be some exposition written about this in the near future,
[02:16:32.148 --> 02:16:41.915]  When Mark and others get out, certain individuals inside the organization there, later it was able to be confirmed, had even blown the whistle on where Mark was at.
[02:16:42.335 --> 02:16:44.016]  That's my understanding of it.
[02:16:44.136 --> 02:16:54.624]  And I believe that because I had had a bug planted in my car when I was over in Battle Creek that I was followed back across the state.
[02:16:55.345 --> 02:16:57.226]  And I've talked about that before on air.
[02:16:57.965 --> 02:17:02.007]  Um, got in my car and got on the expressway and I was, I wasn't going slow.
[02:17:02.767 --> 02:17:08.069]  Um, a good 90 miles drive back here and I was followed all the way across the state.
[02:17:09.169 --> 02:17:12.571]  Um, six or seven miles behind me was the state police officer.
[02:17:13.371 --> 02:17:18.113]  And the reason I know that is I had my CV on and I was listening to what the truckers were saying.
[02:17:18.173 --> 02:17:22.715]  I was expecting to get pulled over anytime, but, uh, that never happened.
[02:17:22.915 --> 02:17:26.456]  They were just busy following me to see if I would lead them to wherever Marcus at.
[02:17:27.945 --> 02:17:32.447]  And then, from the evidence you have, well, we're going to get into that later.
[02:17:32.507 --> 02:17:33.827]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:17:33.867 --> 02:17:38.969]  Let's fast forward to running Mark off the road and then charging him with running into them.
[02:17:39.609 --> 02:17:43.070]  Well, that was, again, this was total setup.
[02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:51.893]  The man that actually robbed the bank only served two years in a minimum security facility with a list of priors as long as your arm.
[02:17:52.971 --> 02:17:53.912]  This gentleman too.
[02:17:54.252 --> 02:17:58.615]  By the way, he was tall, bald, white haired, looked nothing like Mark.
[02:17:59.076 --> 02:18:00.377]  He was really scruffy.
[02:18:01.037 --> 02:18:02.218]  How did the police know though?
[02:18:02.238 --> 02:18:03.159]  Let's be clear about this.
[02:18:03.459 --> 02:18:05.040]  Mark drops money in the drop box, leaves.
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:06.781]  This guy, what, 20 minutes later, robs it.
[02:18:07.162 --> 02:18:14.027]  And even the sheriff's deputy on tape's going, well if it isn't Mark Kornke, why are you saying it's Mark if people are saying it's somebody else?
[02:18:14.307 --> 02:18:15.788]  And they just said, go to cell phone.
[02:18:16.528 --> 02:18:19.991]  Well, what happened here is that the robbery took place.
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:22.922]  Twenty minutes later, Mark shows up, drops it in.
[02:18:22.982 --> 02:18:24.102]  Okay, I got it backwards.
[02:18:24.583 --> 02:18:33.429]  And an officer that didn't like him, okay, has, I think, watched the, uh, oh goodness.
[02:18:35.290 --> 02:18:42.295]  And by the way, Mark had been on the phone and telling people, I'm going to make a deposit.
[02:18:43.035 --> 02:18:43.856]  No, uh-uh.
[02:18:44.236 --> 02:18:46.037]  But we had been under surveillance.
[02:18:46.097 --> 02:18:46.617]  We know that.
[02:18:46.698 --> 02:18:47.518]  I have the FBI
[02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:53.112]  Report as well as the book.
[02:18:53.132 --> 02:18:55.914]  Almost 700 pages.
[02:18:56.174 --> 02:18:59.176]  I just remember that Mark thought there had been surveillance and it was a setup.
[02:18:59.776 --> 02:19:00.197]  It was.
[02:19:00.397 --> 02:19:14.605]  It was absolutely, with the evidence that I have now from the different reports from the police officers, from the FBI, and the other information that we have, that he was under surveillance.
[02:19:15.086 --> 02:19:18.728]  They were watching the house because we had rented a truck to move some furniture.
[02:19:19.563 --> 02:19:21.204]  And that's all we need now.
[02:19:21.784 --> 02:19:23.044]  You know, that's it.
[02:19:23.084 --> 02:19:43.050]  You know, after the Oklahoma City bombing, which we all know is a farce, and in the story that they raise with that, but that's automatically, as soon as I rent a vehicle, they red flag the name and immediately are contacted by the rental company as to
[02:19:43.835 --> 02:19:45.616]  We're running a drug, or whatever.
[02:19:45.636 --> 02:19:49.659]  And to make a long story short, when we get back, what then happened to Mark?
[02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:57.705]  Um, well, this officer that fingered Mark did not even wait for the dispatcher to give a description.
[02:19:59.206 --> 02:20:08.413]  I had hired Richard Mack, he went through the tape, and I go, well that's a tone, that tone is there to tell everybody to shut up and listen because the dispatcher is giving out the description.
[02:20:08.826 --> 02:20:09.387]  Well, stay there.
[02:20:09.427 --> 02:20:11.168]  Let's go over it slowly here.
[02:20:11.188 --> 02:20:11.809]  It's important.
[02:20:12.349 --> 02:20:12.970]  But imagine.
[02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:16.052]  I got it backwards from seven years going back in memory.
[02:20:16.793 --> 02:20:20.376]  Twenty minutes after it's robbed, Mark just walks up and drops money in the drop box.
[02:20:20.416 --> 02:20:21.077]  The cops are there.
[02:20:21.117 --> 02:20:22.638]  He sees them, gets his car, drives off.
[02:20:22.999 --> 02:20:25.321]  Oh, there's our bank robber making a night deposit!
[02:20:26.161 --> 02:20:28.543]  I mean, it's just... It's off the charts.
[02:20:30.618 --> 02:20:31.578]  Good morning, honey.
[02:20:31.958 --> 02:20:37.941]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[02:20:38.221 --> 02:20:38.841]  Yeah.
[02:20:39.201 --> 02:20:40.621]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:20:40.982 --> 02:20:44.383]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[02:20:44.863 --> 02:20:46.343]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:20:46.804 --> 02:20:48.504]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:20:48.904 --> 02:20:50.645]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:20:50.865 --> 02:20:51.806]  Honey, cheer up!
[02:20:52.126 --> 02:20:54.407]  I brought our Spark Berkey Purifiers!
[02:20:54.647 --> 02:20:54.987]  What?
[02:20:55.407 --> 02:21:05.912]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Spark Berkey Purifiers!
[02:21:06.173 --> 02:21:08.434]  You know, this is a terrific cabin!
[02:21:08.594 --> 02:21:11.015]  And wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:21:11.355 --> 02:21:12.536]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:19.520]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:19.540 --> 02:21:20.461]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:21:36.425 --> 02:21:41.246]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:21:41.446 --> 02:21:44.187]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:21:44.227 --> 02:21:45.327]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:21:46.687 --> 02:21:51.288]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:21:52.208 --> 02:21:59.470]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:22:00.470 --> 02:22:03.511]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:22:05.675 --> 02:22:09.118]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:22:10.119 --> 02:22:11.381]  Call for your copy today.
[02:22:11.641 --> 02:22:13.843]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:14.904 --> 02:22:20.750]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:22:21.451 --> 02:22:21.851]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:21.871 --> 02:22:22.091]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:29.893 --> 02:22:32.334]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:22:33.134 --> 02:22:38.755]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:22:38.775 --> 02:22:39.535]  Supreme Court.
[02:22:40.315 --> 02:22:44.616]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[02:22:44.636 --> 02:22:48.297]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:22:49.237 --> 02:22:54.458]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[02:22:55.282 --> 02:23:03.585]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:23:05.146 --> 02:23:06.906]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:23:06.926 --> 02:23:07.306]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:23:15.424 --> 02:23:15.725]  516-8736.
[02:23:19.207 --> 02:23:19.787]  Call now.
[02:23:19.947 --> 02:23:26.512]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:23:29.181 --> 02:23:30.281]  How are you feeling today?
[02:23:30.301 --> 02:23:37.603]  I ask because if you have health challenges, then reading our free booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[02:23:37.723 --> 02:23:42.184]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.
[02:23:42.464 --> 02:23:48.566]  It's a centuries-old medicinal fruit whose time has come and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[02:23:48.766 --> 02:23:49.026]  I think so.
[02:24:09.045 --> 02:24:11.187]  Could this fruit help you in your quest for total health?
[02:24:11.507 --> 02:24:19.234]  Find out why magosteen is known as the queen of all fruits and why it is fast becoming the best-selling wellness product ever brought to the market.
[02:24:19.514 --> 02:24:20.855]  Your health is in your hands.
[02:24:21.135 --> 02:24:22.256]  Do something about it today.
[02:24:22.276 --> 02:24:22.657]  Call 800-681-1909.
[02:24:22.677 --> 02:24:23.137]  Again, that's 800-681-1909.
[02:24:53.925 --> 02:25:09.658]  Imagine the Michigan Militia being demonized on Nightline, Laird News Hour, Frontline, ADL Reports, Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report, being put out demonizing Mark Gregory Kornke as just the ultimate evil.
[02:25:10.078 --> 02:25:11.159]  And why were they so scared of him?
[02:25:11.219 --> 02:25:14.362]  He was articulate, he was laying out the master plan, America in Peril,
[02:25:15.846 --> 02:25:18.547]  And he made a documentary about it.
[02:25:18.607 --> 02:25:20.348]  Everything he said has come true.
[02:25:21.128 --> 02:25:23.189]  But it's slow motion, Red Dawn.
[02:25:23.449 --> 02:25:26.710]  Our troops are foreign, mercenaries, admitted FEMA camps.
[02:25:27.370 --> 02:25:30.631]  Everything he learned about when he was in the Army that he tried to warn people about.
[02:25:30.651 --> 02:25:32.072]  And what did he get for it?
[02:25:32.132 --> 02:25:34.732]  Run off the road by cops and sent to jail for seven years.
[02:25:36.553 --> 02:25:38.994]  And it's totally infiltrated.
[02:25:39.134 --> 02:25:40.054]  Feds everywhere.
[02:25:40.895 --> 02:25:42.795]  Michigan's famous for what happened up there.
[02:25:42.815 --> 02:25:45.056]  Can you please continue, Nancy, with the story?
[02:25:46.762 --> 02:25:49.904]  Well, the biggest thing he's there for is because he named names.
[02:25:50.964 --> 02:25:57.968]  And exposing the bigwigs out there that were involved in all that nonsense.
[02:25:58.168 --> 02:26:00.269]  And it really is nonsense when you look at it.
[02:26:00.409 --> 02:26:14.075]  Where we're at today, because of greed, where he was going with that, this officer, I think he, honestly, two days prior there had been the, oh goodness,
[02:26:15.546 --> 02:26:19.187]  Texas Walker Ranger Program where they had the militia was robbing banks.
[02:26:19.327 --> 02:26:20.707]  I think that was going through his head.
[02:26:20.787 --> 02:26:21.507]  I really do.
[02:26:22.707 --> 02:26:24.068]  Saw Mark, fingered him.
[02:26:24.108 --> 02:26:25.268]  He was nowhere near the bank.
[02:26:25.328 --> 02:26:28.928]  He was ordered to go to the bank and check on the people and secure it.
[02:26:29.508 --> 02:26:30.269]  Did not do that.
[02:26:31.789 --> 02:26:43.831]  Went downtown next door, basically like three doors down from the bank and stopped at the Dairy Queen instead and asked the passerby if they saw anything strange.
[02:26:44.699 --> 02:26:50.242]  And went from there to chasing Mark and whipping everybody up into just a horrendous frenzy.
[02:26:51.262 --> 02:27:09.331]  There were officers from the county, all across the county, that raced here with lights off at 120 miles an hour, guesstimation by other officers who saw and complained were being run off the road by them, to get here to get a piece of him.
[02:27:10.623 --> 02:27:11.724]  It was just unbelievable.
[02:27:12.424 --> 02:27:13.585]  And I guess they feel good.
[02:27:13.605 --> 02:27:15.206]  The guy that robbed the bank went to prison.
[02:27:15.246 --> 02:27:16.307]  No connection to Mark.
[02:27:17.407 --> 02:27:19.909]  Mark goes to prison for being run off the road by him.
[02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:21.970]  And that's the curious thing.
[02:27:22.010 --> 02:27:35.719]  Like I told you, two years minimum security prison this man went to with a list of priors and the minimum sentence in Michigan for first time bank robbery is 15 years.
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:39.101]  That sent up a red flag to me right away.
[02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:56.195]  I sent a gentleman that was a real estate agent in the area where the man was from, a good 200 miles north of us, up in the Grayling area, to check this guy out.
[02:27:56.575 --> 02:27:59.256]  Check the property out.
[02:27:59.316 --> 02:28:00.796]  Eminent domain information.
[02:28:02.356 --> 02:28:05.437]  Find out who financed the house and all that.
[02:28:05.497 --> 02:28:06.418]  Well, he got there.
[02:28:06.438 --> 02:28:07.818]  Well, I can check that online.
[02:28:08.411 --> 02:28:09.872]  Went in and it was blocked.
[02:28:10.192 --> 02:28:11.313]  The information was blocked.
[02:28:11.513 --> 02:28:14.094]  So he went in person down to the township office.
[02:28:15.155 --> 02:28:16.555]  Got there, gave them the address.
[02:28:16.735 --> 02:28:17.936]  That information's blocked.
[02:28:18.476 --> 02:28:28.982]  Now, anywhere else in the country, you can go and you can get the name of the owner, the mortgage company, how much taxes they owe, and how much is left on the mortgage.
[02:28:29.782 --> 02:28:33.004]  That's all information that anybody can get at any time.
[02:28:33.404 --> 02:28:34.184]  And they blocked it.
[02:28:34.605 --> 02:28:37.366]  Well, this man also happened to have been a former senator.
[02:28:38.010 --> 02:28:42.594]  He pulled out his credentials and said, do you want to tell me why you are telling me I can't have this?
[02:28:43.174 --> 02:28:44.676]  And they just looked at him and said it's blocked.
[02:28:45.156 --> 02:28:46.317]  Now that tells me one thing.
[02:28:46.337 --> 02:28:59.388]  This is government owned property, probably either an informant, witness protection program, or this man is working directly with the FBI, CIA, someone within the federal government.
[02:29:00.449 --> 02:29:05.153]  And Nancy, the exact same type of problems that you had up in Michigan,
[02:29:06.592 --> 02:29:10.154]  You've heard about and know about the things we're dealing with down here at Austin.
[02:29:10.734 --> 02:29:14.097]  And I told you about it and you said it's exactly what you've seen before.
[02:29:14.737 --> 02:29:15.878]  It is.
[02:29:16.198 --> 02:29:23.203]  With the email that I received, there is nothing in that email that I have not seen in person before.
[02:29:23.703 --> 02:29:25.805]  From the person in question.
[02:29:27.025 --> 02:29:27.446]  All of it.
[02:29:28.627 --> 02:29:32.569]  Even down to the pulling of a weapon and pointing at somebody who was in the office.
[02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:34.991]  That has happened here.
[02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:40.301]  And it was one of the reasons he was asked to leave.
[02:29:41.082 --> 02:29:45.043]  You know, he went kicking and screaming, but did leave.
[02:29:46.744 --> 02:29:55.648]  Unfortunately, you know, other people did not believe us that these things were going on, but he continues on in the same vein.
[02:29:55.948 --> 02:29:57.569]  So he hasn't changed one iota.
[02:29:58.149 --> 02:30:03.392]  And I just, you know, pray that everybody wakes up and gets on board and understands
[02:30:04.019 --> 02:30:05.800]  Who this person is and what he's doing.
[02:30:07.101 --> 02:30:08.541]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[02:30:08.782 --> 02:30:09.982]  It's just off the charts.
[02:30:10.142 --> 02:30:13.484]  It's what Mark would call standard operational procedure for this individual.
[02:30:13.884 --> 02:30:15.965]  Yeah, the latest thing is going to people's houses.
[02:30:15.985 --> 02:30:16.686]  We'll be right back.
[02:30:19.927 --> 02:30:20.868]  We're on the march.
[02:30:21.328 --> 02:30:22.989]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:23.009 --> 02:30:26.531]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:29.841 --> 02:30:32.524]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:30:32.824 --> 02:30:34.886]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:30:35.126 --> 02:30:37.648]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[02:30:38.089 --> 02:30:42.453]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[02:30:42.573 --> 02:30:43.174]  Here's why.
[02:30:43.574 --> 02:30:49.780]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:56.563]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[02:30:56.704 --> 02:31:00.446]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[02:31:00.666 --> 02:31:04.868]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[02:31:05.348 --> 02:31:09.450]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game.
[02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:12.551]  And above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[02:31:12.991 --> 02:31:13.671]  Get control.
[02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:14.432]  Get relief.
[02:31:14.632 --> 02:31:15.372]  Get some sleep.
[02:31:15.672 --> 02:31:16.672]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[02:31:16.712 --> 02:31:17.613]  That's www.outand90.com.
[02:31:17.733 --> 02:31:18.233]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:31:18.453 --> 02:31:18.673]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:29.602 --> 02:31:35.632]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:31:35.652 --> 02:31:38.677]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the
[02:31:41.493 --> 02:31:41.873]  We're good.
[02:32:00.162 --> 02:32:00.562]  I think so.
[02:32:29.699 --> 02:32:31.460]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:32:31.561 --> 02:32:32.822]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:32:33.062 --> 02:32:35.884]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:32:36.244 --> 02:32:39.006]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:32:39.547 --> 02:32:46.292]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:33:32.541 --> 02:33:38.566]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:33:39.167 --> 02:33:42.169]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:46.293]  I'm going to get more into the Perry vaccine situation with the live cancer virus.
[02:33:47.053 --> 02:33:52.678]  We're going to take calls from Todd, John, John, and Paul, and a few others, Shirley.
[02:33:52.698 --> 02:33:54.780]  And then we're going to wrap up this transmission.
[02:33:55.879 --> 02:34:00.340]  Nancy Kornke, Mark is getting out of jail unless they try to set him up.
[02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:04.181]  He's had a lot of attempted set-ups in prison, has he not, in the last seven years?
[02:34:04.681 --> 02:34:06.361]  He has had one major one.
[02:34:06.381 --> 02:34:07.942]  They were really, really trying.
[02:34:08.822 --> 02:34:14.183]  After 9-11, as you know, both you and Mark predicted 9-11 would happen.
[02:34:14.263 --> 02:34:20.345]  Something big was there and it was going to happen pretty quick on the East Coast, and sure enough, there we go.
[02:34:22.984 --> 02:34:25.426]  After that, of course, were the anthrax scares.
[02:34:25.667 --> 02:34:27.448]  And, as we all know, the U.S.
[02:34:27.508 --> 02:34:34.535]  government certainly didn't give any information on how, if you got something like that in the mail, and personally at your home, what to do.
[02:34:34.555 --> 02:34:37.257]  Neither did the Red Cross.
[02:34:37.838 --> 02:34:45.384]  However, there's volumes and volumes of information available through the military, if you've been prior military.
[02:34:45.504 --> 02:34:49.348]  Well, with Mark, as, you know, being in the military, part of
[02:34:49.955 --> 02:34:56.457]  His training, he was a trainer for NBC, the Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare.
[02:34:56.477 --> 02:34:57.157]  And so what happened?
[02:34:57.537 --> 02:35:00.998]  Well, people started writing him in prison, asking him, what do we do?
[02:35:01.098 --> 02:35:03.338]  How do we decontaminate?
[02:35:03.539 --> 02:35:04.299]  What procedures?
[02:35:04.379 --> 02:35:05.119]  What do we need?
[02:35:05.339 --> 02:35:17.082]  So he made a list of different things necessary to decontaminate yourself, decontaminate your home, vehicle, whatever, from nuclear, biological, or chemical attacks.
[02:35:18.232 --> 02:35:25.397]  And that included bleach, antibacterial soap, and laundry detergent.
[02:35:25.457 --> 02:35:27.979]  To make a long story short, what did they claim he was trying to build?
[02:35:28.359 --> 02:35:28.739]  A bomb.
[02:35:28.759 --> 02:35:30.760]  A bomb.
[02:35:31.081 --> 02:35:33.042]  They claimed he was trying to build a bomb.
[02:35:35.706 --> 02:35:37.127]  I didn't know what it was initially.
[02:35:37.567 --> 02:35:45.373]  I've seen SWAT teams pull people over off the news chopper, and after they SWAT team them for no reason, they hold up jumper cables and say, look, pipe bombs.
[02:35:46.193 --> 02:35:50.076]  I mean, they'd probably take a can of spaghetti sauce and say it was a nuclear weapon.
[02:35:50.617 --> 02:35:52.918]  Well, it was a ridiculous thing to claim.
[02:35:53.078 --> 02:36:00.864]  Actually, in what they had taken from him, they had cut off the top of it, which described exactly what it was.
[02:36:01.908 --> 02:36:03.889]  Okay, so what happened, long story short?
[02:36:03.989 --> 02:36:12.954]  Long story short, I got a hold of Ben Pardon, General Ben Pardon, as one of the top people in the nation dealing with bombs.
[02:36:12.974 --> 02:36:15.395]  Former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[02:36:15.495 --> 02:36:16.255]  Exactly.
[02:36:16.275 --> 02:36:20.257]  Well, he's still one of the six people today that chooses our armament.
[02:36:21.818 --> 02:36:30.202]  So, using him as a reference point, and gathering the information, getting a determination from him that this was for
[02:36:32.116 --> 02:36:32.556]  That's right.
[02:36:53.208 --> 02:37:01.072]  They moved him to a level 3 and with Ben Pardon's information and his determination, we were able to overturn that.
[02:37:01.492 --> 02:37:01.732]  Good.
[02:37:01.752 --> 02:37:05.974]  So Nancy, we don't have much time and I appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:37:06.054 --> 02:37:09.395]  Mark is scheduled to get out the 15th of March.
[02:37:09.455 --> 02:37:11.016]  He's serving all 7 years.
[02:37:11.356 --> 02:37:12.057]  All 7 years.
[02:37:12.097 --> 02:37:13.077]  That's March.
[02:37:13.117 --> 02:37:17.099]  I don't think that's any mistake there that they chose that date.
[02:37:17.139 --> 02:37:17.999]  But he will be out.
[02:37:18.219 --> 02:37:19.860]  If you want to drop him a line real quick.
[02:37:20.496 --> 02:37:21.817]  It's Mark Gregory Kornke.
[02:37:21.837 --> 02:37:26.242]  His prison number is 295-350.
[02:37:27.122 --> 02:37:36.571]  He is at the Mid-Michigan Correctional Facility, a little closer to home, at 8201 North Croswell Road in St.
[02:37:36.631 --> 02:37:37.692]  Louis, Michigan, 48880.
[02:37:40.936 --> 02:37:45.038]  Well, he's going to be getting out here in about 41 days.
[02:37:45.318 --> 02:37:46.459]  About 41 days.
[02:37:46.899 --> 02:37:54.503]  I immediately, because they're going to try to set him up immediately when he gets out, I want to immediately get Mark on air as soon as he gets out.
[02:37:55.864 --> 02:37:57.104]  Well, he's looking forward to that.
[02:37:57.124 --> 02:37:59.886]  He's been writing books, as a matter of fact, Alex.
[02:38:02.607 --> 02:38:06.209]  One done, one in rewrite, and another one that's almost finished.
[02:38:07.376 --> 02:38:11.258]  I'm getting them off to the publisher and get everything squared away, all the artwork done.
[02:38:11.418 --> 02:38:13.358]  And the spirit out here hasn't been broken?
[02:38:13.538 --> 02:38:14.419]  Oh, not even.
[02:38:14.599 --> 02:38:14.799]  No.
[02:38:15.099 --> 02:38:15.499]  No, no, no.
[02:38:15.559 --> 02:38:16.960]  He plans on hitting the ground running.
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:25.543]  Has two tours planned already through the South and through the West and goodness, lots of things on the horizon.
[02:38:26.863 --> 02:38:27.944]  Well, that's just fabulous.
[02:38:27.964 --> 02:38:30.965]  Give out your address or your phone number for anybody that wants to support you.
[02:38:31.185 --> 02:38:34.366]  The easiest one here is to use our post office box.
[02:38:34.446 --> 02:38:35.387]  That's PO Box 194.
[02:38:36.994 --> 02:38:37.876]  Dexter, Michigan, 48130.
[02:38:37.916 --> 02:38:39.860]  Again, that's PO Box 194, Dexter, Michigan, 48130.
[02:38:46.073 --> 02:38:48.054]  And you can write to me Nancy Kornke.
[02:39:16.596 --> 02:39:18.004]  We see expanding today.
[02:39:18.957 --> 02:39:22.318]  And so Nancy, we'll have you up real soon before Mark gets out.
[02:39:22.658 --> 02:39:23.178]  Alright.
[02:39:23.258 --> 02:39:29.580]  And we'll also, you know, get into some more exposés as we document all of our information.
[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:30.600]  Really powerful.
[02:39:31.020 --> 02:39:38.782]  And I know that Mark's considering going completely public about who some of these people are too, even though he never likes to, you know, have that type of stuff go on.
[02:39:38.822 --> 02:39:41.342]  Sometimes it has to be done when he gets out of prison.
[02:39:41.642 --> 02:39:45.023]  So I do look forward to talking to you and Mark on the air very, very soon.
[02:39:45.063 --> 02:39:45.543]  Give your P.O.
[02:39:45.563 --> 02:39:46.424]  Box out one more time.
[02:39:46.664 --> 02:39:47.204]  That's P.O.
[02:39:47.224 --> 02:39:47.424]  Box 194.
[02:39:48.784 --> 02:39:50.244]  Dexter, Michigan, 48130.
[02:39:50.284 --> 02:39:51.805]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:39:52.145 --> 02:39:55.346]  Thank you, Nancy, and I'm going to try to give you a call tonight.
[02:39:55.366 --> 02:39:56.446]  Alright, good.
[02:39:57.026 --> 02:39:58.186]  Thanks a lot and God bless.
[02:39:59.827 --> 02:40:01.687]  Alright, there goes Nancy Kornke.
[02:40:01.707 --> 02:40:04.268]  They have been through so much and set up twice.
[02:40:04.928 --> 02:40:08.769]  Just unbelievable to see this type of thing happen.
[02:40:09.009 --> 02:40:13.290]  Seven years in prison for the police running you off the road.
[02:40:14.591 --> 02:40:16.151]  And the fellow who really robbed the bank,
[02:40:17.333 --> 02:40:19.314]  Two years in minimum security.
[02:40:22.075 --> 02:40:26.358]  Very, very interesting, to say the least.
[02:40:28.979 --> 02:40:36.463]  I tell ya, I tell ya, it's just horrible to see what happens to good people.
[02:40:36.503 --> 02:40:37.663]  We need to pray for all of them.
[02:40:39.124 --> 02:40:40.705]  Let's talk to Todd in Ohio.
[02:40:40.765 --> 02:40:41.625]  Todd, you're on the air.
[02:40:41.665 --> 02:40:42.106]  Go ahead.
[02:40:42.126 --> 02:40:44.227]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:40:45.671 --> 02:40:51.476]  First, I wanted to say as a 16-year military veteran, I strongly support Lieutenant Watada, and I wish him well.
[02:40:52.837 --> 02:40:53.178]  Are you there?
[02:40:54.179 --> 02:40:54.839]  Yes, I am, sir.
[02:40:55.340 --> 02:40:55.520]  Okay.
[02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:58.722]  I have two questions on monetary reform.
[02:40:58.802 --> 02:41:06.329]  I agree with you, as well as Aaron Russo and Ron Paul, that our privately controlled, debt-based money system is horribly corrupt.
[02:41:06.349 --> 02:41:07.630]  And we don't really owe that money.
[02:41:08.430 --> 02:41:08.591]  Right.
[02:41:08.711 --> 02:41:10.092]  It's a very corrupt system.
[02:41:10.172 --> 02:41:11.293]  It needs to be eliminated.
[02:41:11.333 --> 02:41:12.414]  However, I disagree.
[02:41:13.209 --> 02:41:17.993]  I know at the end of the documentary they go through a plan to basically monetize it, and that goes through a whole sophisticated program.
[02:41:18.013 --> 02:41:22.015]  I'm not even saying particularly go back to the gold standard.
[02:41:22.035 --> 02:41:23.897]  We can have the government issue the currency.
[02:41:23.917 --> 02:41:25.118]  It just isn't debt-based.
[02:41:42.957 --> 02:41:45.539]  Uh, but there's also arguments for a gold standard.
[02:41:46.179 --> 02:41:47.840]  And so, you know, that's open for debate.
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:50.262]  The bottom line is this current system is a fraud.
[02:41:50.882 --> 02:41:54.304]  Right, yeah, because it's monetized debt.
[02:41:54.544 --> 02:41:56.926]  It's not what currency is composed of.
[02:41:56.946 --> 02:41:58.147]  It's how it comes into circulation.
[02:41:58.167 --> 02:42:01.269]  Well, it's been about eight, nine years since I saw the Money Masters.
[02:42:01.289 --> 02:42:03.190]  Why don't you tell them about their plans at the end of the film?
[02:42:04.242 --> 02:42:11.607]  Well, long story short, it basically advocates, instead of a debt-based fiat money system, it advocates a debt-free fiat money system.
[02:42:11.647 --> 02:42:15.010]  Yeah, the government just issues it, and then the money is used as a mode of exchange.
[02:42:15.410 --> 02:42:26.538]  The key point is that it has to, and this is something similar to something Milton Friedman advocated, which is it has to be tagged by law to objective criteria, which would take it out of the hands of both bankers and politicians.
[02:42:26.978 --> 02:42:27.499]  I think so.
[02:42:40.293 --> 02:42:41.813]  Well, yeah, we know what happened.
[02:42:41.853 --> 02:42:42.694]  I appreciate your call.
[02:43:04.369 --> 02:43:05.730]  Marshall Law was declared.
[02:43:06.290 --> 02:43:08.971]  They ordered everyone to turn their gold in for paper notes.
[02:43:09.071 --> 02:43:11.253]  So you can bring an ounce of gold in and you get $20.
[02:43:11.873 --> 02:43:12.173]  Paper.
[02:43:12.693 --> 02:43:13.414]  It's really cotton.
[02:43:14.554 --> 02:43:16.575]  You get a greenback.
[02:43:16.755 --> 02:43:31.263]  Then the globalists took that and sold it to Europe at cost, and then overnight, once they had the gold supply, they then doubled its value by manipulating the price of it.
[02:43:31.283 --> 02:43:32.964]  So what the caller brings up is true.
[02:43:34.728 --> 02:43:39.709]  Just because Europe owns most of our gold, that's where most of it you end up buying out of gold sellers here in the U.S.
[02:43:39.729 --> 02:43:40.509]  is where it comes from.
[02:43:41.429 --> 02:43:43.670]  So you can still physically buy gold.
[02:43:44.030 --> 02:43:44.910]  I want to make that clear.
[02:43:45.470 --> 02:43:47.010]  I'm saying don't even trust in government.
[02:43:47.551 --> 02:43:53.712]  Things are so far gone, once it all crashes we can try to rebuild it and get a better system and I totally support what the caller was saying.
[02:43:54.592 --> 02:43:59.633]  I just, I don't want to confuse people that gold is not a good investment, it's a wonderful investment.
[02:44:00.599 --> 02:44:02.321]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:44:02.401 --> 02:44:05.604]  John in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:44:05.624 --> 02:44:07.986]  Hi Alex, I have three real quick things.
[02:44:08.086 --> 02:44:18.476]  The first one is a few days ago I called up and you told me to take the line of code for the MySpace page and make the code and send it to you.
[02:44:19.156 --> 02:44:21.879]  I sent it to Ryan at InfoWars today.
[02:44:22.977 --> 02:44:26.780]  And the second thing is... Well, let's fill people in and then we'll know what you were talking about.
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:42.851]  I called out and... Sure, well, yeah, you said that there's a piece of code that can be done where we can post the link to my radio show on the website, and I believe on my MySpace account there is a link just to click and listen, but you're saying some type of player, and so, great!
[02:44:43.512 --> 02:44:51.557]  Yeah, I made that code, and it's a little box that you can put in your listen page or whatever, and people can just copy the code from it and paste it right to their MySpace page.
[02:44:51.798 --> 02:44:51.998]  Great.
[02:44:52.506 --> 02:45:04.056]  The second thing is that I was just looking at Netflix and I found Aaron Russo's film, Freedom to Fascism, and your film, 9-11 Rise of the Police State, both on there.
[02:45:04.076 --> 02:45:06.197]  You mean Terror Storm?
[02:45:06.498 --> 02:45:07.939]  Yeah, Terror Storm, that's what I meant.
[02:45:08.119 --> 02:45:18.047]  Anyway, and the third thing is, a couple days ago a caller called up that you falsely accused of being a CIA.
[02:45:19.088 --> 02:45:21.450]  This guy named Roman from my hometown.
[02:45:22.139 --> 02:45:24.280]  He, uh... I don't believe that's the case.
[02:45:24.820 --> 02:45:25.021]  Huh?
[02:45:25.341 --> 02:45:26.401]  I don't believe that's the case.
[02:45:26.481 --> 02:45:27.622]  You think he is CIA?
[02:45:27.782 --> 02:45:33.225]  No, I don't even know who this caller is or this person is, but I don't remember in the last week accusing a caller of being CIA.
[02:45:33.265 --> 02:45:35.006]  Uh, not last week, I mean yesterday.
[02:45:36.447 --> 02:45:38.488]  He called up talking about the Freemasons.
[02:45:39.388 --> 02:45:40.309]  No, I did not.
[02:45:40.409 --> 02:45:44.391]  In fact, in fact, and that's who I thought you were talking about, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:45:45.191 --> 02:45:45.531]  Okay.
[02:45:46.792 --> 02:45:50.374]  Uh, if you listened to that call, in fact, I should ask him when it was.
[02:45:51.604 --> 02:45:53.045]  Was that in the third hour yesterday?
[02:45:53.065 --> 02:45:55.087]  No, it was in the second hour.
[02:45:56.688 --> 02:46:00.211]  In fact, I think he came on about thirty-five after the second hour.
[02:46:00.231 --> 02:46:01.912]  In fact, I like doing this sometimes.
[02:46:01.952 --> 02:46:04.434]  Go in there and listen to a caller named Roman.
[02:46:04.454 --> 02:46:06.956]  I think it's like the middle of the second hour.
[02:46:06.976 --> 02:46:12.400]  And I want to play that, because I'm tired of people calling in here with false accusations of this show.
[02:46:13.861 --> 02:46:14.202]  Alright?
[02:46:14.442 --> 02:46:15.483]  And I'm not mad at you, sir.
[02:46:15.523 --> 02:46:17.724]  Thanks for writing a code to get the show out and all that.
[02:46:18.005 --> 02:46:19.045]  But people don't listen.
[02:46:20.346 --> 02:46:20.947]  They don't listen.
[02:46:21.579 --> 02:46:29.402]  Every time I say, you can download Terror Storm for free on Google Video, I get a bunch of calls and emails going, you said your film's free!
[02:46:29.483 --> 02:46:30.163]  Send it to me!
[02:46:30.643 --> 02:46:35.965]  I can't ship it to you for six, seven bucks free, and ship you the DVD for free.
[02:46:36.005 --> 02:46:38.867]  I'm saying it's on Google Video for free.
[02:46:40.647 --> 02:46:41.688]  And it's the same thing.
[02:46:43.189 --> 02:46:46.810]  The caller called in and said, why don't you say Freemasons run everything?
[02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:48.711]  And that 9-11 was a Freemason job.
[02:46:49.429 --> 02:47:02.015]  And then I went through people that attack me who are in the government, or involved in the government, and I said, not you, sir, but other people, not the caller, but others that say, he won't say it's just the Catholics, he's an agent.
[02:47:02.295 --> 02:47:04.156]  He won't say it's just the Jews, he's an agent.
[02:47:04.496 --> 02:47:09.858]  He won't say it's just the blah blah blah, and I said, no, it's evil people in every major group are part of this New World Order.
[02:47:11.599 --> 02:47:17.402]  And then I went on, and then I even took time out, knowing how people's brains work,
[02:47:18.012 --> 02:47:20.552]  To go, and I'm not saying you're bad.
[02:47:21.593 --> 02:47:23.313]  I'm not saying you're the agent.
[02:47:24.613 --> 02:47:28.674]  And then the next day, you falsely accuse someone of being an agent.
[02:47:29.394 --> 02:47:30.394]  John, can you find that?
[02:47:32.735 --> 02:47:43.816]  I'm going from memory here, but I think... I think it was in the fourth segment of hour two.
[02:47:45.877 --> 02:47:46.637]  And, uh...
[02:47:48.030 --> 02:47:53.193]  Man, I ended up doing like a five, six minute rant off of it into that 50 after break.
[02:47:55.114 --> 02:47:57.516]  But again, folks, it's not about me.
[02:47:57.736 --> 02:48:02.839]  I'm just, I mean, frankly, I'm sitting here with an incredible headache, with a sinus headache right now, with allergies.
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:04.260]  I'm tired.
[02:48:04.300 --> 02:48:08.643]  I'm just trying to cover the news and get the info out to you and expose how the system works.
[02:48:10.004 --> 02:48:16.708]  And I know everybody's looking for me to have all the answers and know how to get everything done, and I don't, folks.
[02:48:17.603 --> 02:48:18.203]  I really don't.
[02:48:19.263 --> 02:48:21.444]  Let's go ahead and take another call while he tries to find that.
[02:48:21.464 --> 02:48:22.404]  I'm almost out of time.
[02:48:22.424 --> 02:48:23.785]  I don't have enough time to play it.
[02:48:24.725 --> 02:48:25.805]  It's there in the archives.
[02:48:25.825 --> 02:48:26.685]  Just go listen to it.
[02:48:27.686 --> 02:48:30.726]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio.
[02:48:30.766 --> 02:48:31.567]  John, go ahead.
[02:48:32.387 --> 02:48:44.650]  Yes, I'm really concerned about this catastrophic move towards third world war and this attempt to drag us in using the same lies and the same wires that dragged us into this catastrophe in Iraq.
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:56.844]  And using the same lies and liars which the Democrats, Republicans, and especially the media are complicit in, into an even more catastrophic war with Iran.
[02:48:56.924 --> 02:49:05.767]  Yeah, we're sitting here on the edge of World War III, it could mean millions dead, and after the history books are written, it's just we're in trouble.
[02:49:05.827 --> 02:49:06.467]  Man, it's bad.
[02:49:06.727 --> 02:49:12.209]  Well, you know, there's a lot of people that are on the inside, and I've been checking some of the websites.
[02:49:12.882 --> 02:49:25.330]  And people even in the military and intelligence circles in the Pentagon that are leaking stuff to Seymour Hersh, Scott Ritter, and others who are absolutely considered these people in the White House mad and crazy.
[02:49:25.830 --> 02:49:32.334]  And a particularly stunning one I saw on WSWS.org, Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[02:49:32.927 --> 02:49:39.952]  This man is a very sinister character himself, who's been involved in provocations when he started the war in Afghanistan.
[02:49:39.972 --> 02:49:42.173]  He's co-founder of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:49:42.313 --> 02:49:42.914]  Right.
[02:49:43.414 --> 02:49:45.275]  And now he's declassified.
[02:49:45.295 --> 02:49:57.283]  Well, he admitted it, then it was declassified, that in 79, when Carter had actually started a war against the Soviets, the Soviets were provocateured into coming into Afghanistan, and that was all meant to just bleed them.
[02:49:57.584 --> 02:50:02.787]  But many historians now say it was actually to create the radical Muslim Mujahideen to spread it and export it.
[02:50:03.187 --> 02:50:11.750]  Yes, and coming from this man, a man like that, really kind of a terrifying testimony last Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
[02:50:12.251 --> 02:50:18.553]  The media was totally silent about this plans for war by the Bush administration.
[02:50:18.613 --> 02:50:20.214]  He was absolutely appalled by it.
[02:50:20.674 --> 02:50:27.977]  He says that it was a scathing denunciation of both the war in Iraq and this planned war catastrophe against Iran.
[02:50:28.377 --> 02:50:31.538]  And he says that the United States government is actually
[02:50:31.969 --> 02:50:40.751]  He strongly suggested, I should say, that they're capable of a provocation for provoking a terrorist attack in the United States.
[02:50:40.771 --> 02:50:41.912]  Was Zinske said that?
[02:50:42.552 --> 02:50:45.612]  He came very close and strongly hinted.
[02:50:46.113 --> 02:50:49.413]  WSWS.org What's the headline on the story?
[02:50:49.453 --> 02:50:51.834]  And I'll get one of my people to do an article on it.
[02:50:52.968 --> 02:51:02.214]  Well, their headline is a political bombshell from Zbigniew Brzezinski, that's National Security Advisors, warns that the Bush administration is seeking a pretext to attack Iran.
[02:51:02.714 --> 02:51:08.257]  And he brings out that there's actually, he cites other examples prior to the war with
[02:51:10.203 --> 02:51:17.471]  The administration, as you mentioned, was planning to provoke Iraq into shooting at an American plane.
[02:51:18.692 --> 02:51:20.734]  We're out of time.
[02:51:21.035 --> 02:51:21.395]  Thank you.
[02:51:21.455 --> 02:51:22.156]  Final segment.
[02:51:32.882 --> 02:51:36.064]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:51:36.404 --> 02:51:38.306]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:38.706 --> 02:51:46.351]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:47.034 --> 02:51:54.077]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:54.477 --> 02:52:05.902]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:06.222 --> 02:52:09.724]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:10.184 --> 02:52:12.105]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:12.445 --> 02:52:16.287]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:29.762 --> 02:52:34.986]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:52:35.126 --> 02:52:43.232]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:52:43.492 --> 02:52:50.537]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:52:51.478 --> 02:52:57.963]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:52:58.163 --> 02:53:03.248]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:53:03.368 --> 02:53:12.235]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:53:12.515 --> 02:53:17.279]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium
[02:53:21.369 --> 02:53:22.150]  We're good to go.
[02:53:46.588 --> 02:53:48.170]  Your health is priceless.

[02:54:25.463 --> 02:54:28.085]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[02:54:34.975 --> 02:54:38.016]  Well, the call from Roman was exactly where I thought it was.
[02:54:38.076 --> 02:54:39.657]  It was about an 8-minute call.
[02:54:39.717 --> 02:54:41.118]  He was on about 2-3 minutes.
[02:54:41.138 --> 02:54:43.839]  I don't have time to play it all here in a final 5-minute segment.
[02:54:44.799 --> 02:54:49.381]  But here I am explaining that I cover all the different evil groups and how they all nexus together.
[02:54:50.102 --> 02:54:54.744]  And then I say that the people that are attacking me out there with these websites are operatives.
[02:54:55.364 --> 02:54:57.885]  And then I say, but I'm not saying you're an operative caller.
[02:54:58.886 --> 02:55:00.606]  And then I'm accused of saying he's an operative.
[02:55:00.926 --> 02:55:04.308]  So, here it is for you what I said.
[02:55:06.059 --> 02:55:10.463]  I cover what I think are the most important facets, and I bring guests on who cover all the others.
[02:55:11.363 --> 02:55:16.227]  And we've talked about the Israeli connections, and they're clearly there.
[02:55:16.307 --> 02:55:18.869]  We talk about them every couple days.
[02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:29.918]  And I'll get the calls, and the big exposés are written that I've never once talked about it, and I... and I... and I... I didn't talk about 9-11 for years after it!
[02:55:30.399 --> 02:55:31.399]  Which is totally untrue.
[02:55:31.419 --> 02:55:33.421]  I talked about it before it happened, the day it happened.
[02:55:34.406 --> 02:55:36.408]  Those are just operatives and disinfo people.
[02:55:36.448 --> 02:55:43.713]  Instead of us just knowing it's an inside job, they want to get us all fighting with each other instead of moving forward to educate the public that it was an inside job.
[02:55:46.215 --> 02:55:47.876]  And I'm not saying you're an operative, sir.
[02:55:47.916 --> 02:55:49.858]  You sound genuine and you sound serious.
[02:55:54.241 --> 02:55:58.304]  But quite frankly, I don't believe that 9-11 was a
[02:56:01.445 --> 02:56:02.686]  Free Masonic Job.
[02:56:02.726 --> 02:56:10.512]  I mean, you've got 9-1-1, the Masonic numbers, you've got the two towers, used in Masonic rituals where they, you know, have the ritual of knocking down the two pillars.
[02:56:11.393 --> 02:56:13.155]  Who's the next caller?
[02:56:13.175 --> 02:56:13.975]  Because I've got a bunch here.
[02:56:16.057 --> 02:56:19.380]  Okay, I just played that clip for you, and there you go.
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:21.642]  I did not say you were a CIA operative.
[02:56:21.942 --> 02:56:25.365]  I said people attacking me in big exposés clearly are.
[02:56:25.905 --> 02:56:27.606]  Then I said, no, I'm not saying you are.
[02:56:27.646 --> 02:56:29.408]  You brought up serious info.
[02:56:30.561 --> 02:56:34.924]  I didn't disagree with you, I didn't call you an operative, and you just said I did.
[02:56:36.765 --> 02:56:39.467]  You'll probably hate me for proving you wrong, it's okay.
[02:56:39.527 --> 02:56:39.767]  Fine.
[02:56:41.188 --> 02:56:43.470]  Uh, let's, uh, I just am tired of it, frankly.
[02:56:44.450 --> 02:56:48.933]  Uh, let's, uh, go ahead and talk to, uh, you say Dick?
[02:56:49.694 --> 02:56:51.375]  Paul in Arizona, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:56:51.795 --> 02:56:54.697]  Yeah, Alex, uh, Paul in Arizona, just a quick question.
[02:56:55.238 --> 02:56:58.640]  What can you tell me about the organization that's called We The People?
[02:57:00.394 --> 02:57:06.817]  That's a great organization, effectively exposing the fact that the IRS is a collection agency for the private Federal Reserve.
[02:57:07.437 --> 02:57:09.878]  And I've interviewed the head of the group and been very supportive of them.
[02:57:09.918 --> 02:57:14.179]  And they run full-page ads in major magazines and newspapers like USA Today.
[02:57:14.199 --> 02:57:15.860]  Yeah, they've got a good website.
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:18.621]  Yeah, and we support them fully.
[02:57:18.681 --> 02:57:20.242]  It's all part of exposing the fraud.
[02:57:20.502 --> 02:57:25.103]  Just like there is no law you've got to take this live cancer virus, there's no law you've got to pay the income tax.
[02:57:25.143 --> 02:57:26.104]  It's not a real tax.
[02:57:26.364 --> 02:57:28.004]  It goes directly to the private bankers.
[02:57:28.104 --> 02:57:29.225]  Even Ronald Reagan said that.
[02:57:30.546 --> 02:57:31.106]  All right, thank you.
[02:57:32.067 --> 02:57:33.528]  Thank you, I appreciate your call.
[02:57:33.568 --> 02:57:39.753]  No, I think they're a good mainline patriot organization that does good work and exposes a lot of corruption.
[02:57:41.194 --> 02:57:45.798]  I need to get him on, the head of that group, as soon as possible.
[02:57:46.599 --> 02:57:50.662]  There's a lot of guests I've interviewed many times over the years, and I haven't had them back in years.
[02:57:52.503 --> 02:57:56.026]  And the We The People folks are some of the ones that I need to have on the broadcast.
[02:57:56.987 --> 02:57:57.827]  All right, I'm out of time.
[02:57:58.568 --> 02:57:59.669]  I haven't plugged it all day!
