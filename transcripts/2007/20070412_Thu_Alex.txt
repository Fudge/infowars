[00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:06.037]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.698 --> 00:00:07.779]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:09.600]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:11.082]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:12.783]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:17.327]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.568 --> 00:00:21.671]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:33.958]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.978 --> 00:00:34.479]  Welcome.
[00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:35.880]  It is already the twelfth day of April 2007.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.425]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, wide open, telephones.
[00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:57.484]  Kurt Vonnegut died yesterday.
[00:00:57.504 --> 00:01:02.948]  I was shocked when I... I was a fan of several of his books and short stories.
[00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:16.218]  When I turned the computer on last night when I got home about one o'clock from work, and there it was, Kurt Vonnegut dead, I was very close to getting Kurt Vonnegut on the show.
[00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.802]  I was contacted by Kurt Vonnegut's people
[00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:39.269]  About a year ago, a little over a year ago, on my wall I have a little lithograph artwork that Kurt Vonnegut did that he hand-signed and mailed to me of a birdcage open with the bird gone, I guess the sign of freedom.
[00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:51.179]  And I don't know, I don't know if I should tell you what I know about Kurt Vonnegut, but I figure going to the grave
[00:01:52.521 --> 00:02:01.029]  This iconoclast, one of the last living literary icons of the 20th century.
[00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:03.972]  Very interesting person.
[00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:08.136]  He, of course, was captured in the Battle of the Bulge against the Nazis.
[00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:12.580]  He was in a POW camp when Dresden was bombed by the Allies.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.125]  And then, of course, wrote Slaughterhouse-Five, because that's where they literally stayed.
[00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:24.312]  We put it into science fiction terms where he's teleported back in time.
[00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:26.752]  Kurt Vonnegut is dead.
[00:02:26.773 --> 00:02:29.073]  And I'm going to think about it.
[00:02:29.373 --> 00:02:35.754]  You know, this morning I'm going to take that picture off the wall, take it up here, because I wasn't going to scan it and put it on the web, you know, while he was still alive.
[00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:38.155]  But I figure he's dead now and it's interesting.
[00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:43.116]  I forgot to bring it from the house here to the office to scan it in.
[00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:48.597]  I might send somebody over to my house to get it and put a story together about it.
[00:02:51.468 --> 00:03:00.655]  Well I'll tell you about Kurt Vonnegut, I'll tell you what, when we start the next hour because I need to think about what I want to say and how I want to say it.
[00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.040]  Who knows, in an hour I may say nothing at all.
[00:03:08.782 --> 00:03:20.631]  I may not even put that piece of art that Kurt did that he mailed me just out of the clear blue sky and then I had a chance to
[00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:23.876]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:03:23.896 --> 00:03:28.500]  All right, we've got all this serious news today.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.102]  They want a new war czar.
[00:03:31.142 --> 00:03:34.364]  They want to completely abolish what's left of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:03:34.544 --> 00:03:36.966]  Really, there's nothing left, but they want to publicly announce it.
[00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:42.671]  Meanwhile, you've got the big Don Imus distraction diversion.
[00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:48.155]  Rosie O'Donnell is right when she said that what he said is distasteful, but here come the thought police.
[00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:48.776]  Who's next?
[00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:53.852]  And one of the Neocon websites was crowing for her firing.
[00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:57.256]  And I was kind of agnostic on the subject until last night.
[00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:01.720]  Fox News was on in the background monitoring the CIA channel.
[00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:10.169]  And there was Bill O'Reilly talking with Al Sharpton, so I thought here are two equally distasteful individuals.
[00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:12.411]  I will just turn
[00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:15.828]  The television set up and see what they're saying.
[00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:17.629]  O'Reilly thinks it's wonderful.
[00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:18.710]  Let's fire everyone.
[00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:33.981]  He's calling for a national jihad, a witch hunt, a new Red Scare to fire anyone and everyone who says anything that is even slightly controversial.
[00:04:36.414 --> 00:04:46.016]  And I'll say it again, CPS in New York can take black kids and feed them pesticides until they die, in test, and the black community isn't going to say a word because the media isn't going to pick up on it.
[00:04:47.797 --> 00:04:51.677]  But people are going to... I mean, I've gotten hundreds of emails about this and a bunch of phone calls.
[00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:53.378]  Why aren't you talking about I.M.I.S.?
[00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:57.099]  Well, I looked into I.M.I.S., and I'll tell you what I think about that when we get back.
[00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:58.139]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:07.353]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:09.594]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:17.619]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:25.361]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:37.207]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.507 --> 00:05:41.409]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.370]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.572]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.773 --> 00:06:10.842]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.082 --> 00:06:22.312]  Black quirky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.652 --> 00:06:27.477]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[00:06:27.697 --> 00:06:27.897]  I think?
[00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:47.830]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.450]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.750]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.751]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:03.822]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:07:04.442 --> 00:07:13.364]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:07:13.804 --> 00:07:21.006]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:07:21.736 --> 00:07:27.218]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:07:27.718 --> 00:07:38.541]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:41.361]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.262]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:55.307]  Or, visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:59.009]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:08:02.371 --> 00:08:08.394]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.014 --> 00:08:11.976]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:14.649]  Yeah.
[00:08:31.124 --> 00:08:33.105]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[00:08:33.265 --> 00:08:35.545]  Again, Kurt Vonnegut died yesterday.
[00:08:35.566 --> 00:08:47.910]  I'm going to comment on my tenuous communications with Kurt Vonnegut and the nice note that he sent me and the piece of art he sent me.
[00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.811]  And I want to read a little bit from Slaughterhouse-Five.
[00:08:54.632 --> 00:08:58.313]  Coming up, and I'll do that in the next hour, we're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:09:02.332 --> 00:09:10.921]  We don't have any people scheduled for the show, which I like doing from time to time, just take phone calls and cover news.
[00:09:15.386 --> 00:09:18.570]  Let me just read you some of the headlines we've got here in front of us today.
[00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.415]  Three generals spurn the position of war czar.
[00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:29.615]  Bush announces he wants a war czar yesterday and within hours three generals have already said they don't want the job.
[00:09:30.215 --> 00:09:33.276]  Bush seeks overseer for Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:09:33.936 --> 00:09:40.338]  So we'll get into Bush wants a war czar and leading into this report as well.
[00:09:43.239 --> 00:09:53.722]  Also we will get into some new big eminent domain laws as they try to expand eminent domain that is land grabbing your property
[00:09:54.813 --> 00:10:12.656]  Also, last week I saw two separate articles pointing out that the Tillman family believes that there is more, could be more, than just friendly fire in the death of Pat Tillman.
[00:10:13.116 --> 00:10:17.677]  And we did talk to Kevin Tillman about six, seven months ago repeatedly.
[00:10:18.837 --> 00:10:22.078]  We did talk to Kevin Tillman's best friend, who was also friends with Pat,
[00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.912]  They said that, oh, well, we'll probably come on later.
[00:10:27.012 --> 00:10:28.012]  Right now is not the time.
[00:10:28.032 --> 00:10:36.439]  And then next time we tried the number, it was disconnected and we were unable to get back in touch with Kevin Tillman, Pat Tillman's brother, and others.
[00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:41.762]  And they told us some things over the phone that I didn't really want to repeat on air.
[00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:51.790]  But I did just say that there are people out there in the community who were not buying the story that
[00:10:53.891 --> 00:11:15.129]  Pat was killed in Friendly Fire and now it's emerged that he did write letters, he did make statements that he abhorred, he told family he abhorred the Iraq War, that Iraq was not involved, that he'd been to Iraq and of course he'd also been to Afghanistan and that it was wrong what was happening and we know that he was making noises about going public.
[00:11:15.689 --> 00:11:19.953]  Now if you think they're going to let their poster boy, Mr. NFL
[00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:31.468]  A football star, who they'd already made into a big hero, go shoot his mouth off about what he'd seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, you've got another thing coming.
[00:11:33.409 --> 00:11:35.471]  And we held back on writing an article on this.
[00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:40.534]  I ammed a few of these to Paul Watson last week, and I guess he didn't do a story on it.
[00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:41.495]  We need to do one on it.
[00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:45.557]  I need to go do more research and kind of recodify all the research I've already done.
[00:11:45.577 --> 00:11:47.419]  That's kind of how my research goes.
[00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:49.220]  I pick up a piece here, a piece there, and then
[00:11:50.402 --> 00:11:54.826]  A year later, I've got all the pieces and I'm like, but I gotta go pick them up again and put them back together.
[00:11:55.987 --> 00:12:00.371]  I've come across all the pieces, but I need to kind of reconfigure it all.
[00:12:03.533 --> 00:12:04.374]  Because that's the problem.
[00:12:04.394 --> 00:12:05.615]  There's just too much news here.
[00:12:05.695 --> 00:12:10.940]  And in tying into the whole Pat Tillman thing, there's new developments on that today.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.102]  Remember Private Lynch?
[00:12:14.446 --> 00:12:34.274]  The convoy lost in the dust storm during the takeover of Iraq in 2003 in late March and they get caught by an Iraqi patrol and they claim that the Iraqis killed almost everybody in her group but a few survivors and that she went like Audie Murphy
[00:12:35.683 --> 00:12:37.784]  I mean, you're a liberal and you're not for it.
[00:12:37.864 --> 00:12:38.925]  And I ain't no liberal.
[00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:10.617]  And then it started coming out that Jerry Bruckheimer had been contacted when they knew what hospital she was in.
[00:13:10.637 --> 00:13:18.958]  And for three days, the two and a half days, the Iraqi doctors were pointing out, no one's here, the troops have pulled out, you're in control, you're just a mile away.
[00:13:19.678 --> 00:13:23.839]  We've got several of your soldiers, including Private Lynch, we've got some dead bodies we collected as well.
[00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:27.960]  You know, we're pro-America, as most Iraqis were at the time.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.600]  They believed all the propaganda.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.380]  Please come get her.
[00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:33.701]  And so they contacted Bruckheimer by SAT.
[00:13:34.693 --> 00:13:35.394]  We're good to go.
[00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:04.795]  Then it turned out that, I forget his name, it was a Hispanic fellow, a bunch of the drivers cowered, or got shot, or ran for cover, as she did.
[00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:15.320]  One particular Hispanic gentleman did actually kill a bunch of Iraqis, and did actually fight them hand-to-hand, and did actually get killed, and shot a bunch, and stabbed at point-blank range.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.861]  So they just kind of shelved him to the side, gave her all the credit.
[00:14:19.142 --> 00:14:20.242]  As usual, that's how it works.
[00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:26.285]  And then suddenly, members of the group that had survived were going, no, that's not how it happened.
[00:14:27.381 --> 00:14:30.884]  And then members of the rescue team started saying that's not how it happened in the raid.
[00:14:31.665 --> 00:14:33.266]  And was it four or five of them?
[00:14:34.227 --> 00:14:49.860]  One was in Arizona in a middle-class neighborhood with a security fence around the house cooking a welcome back deal in a barbecue and somebody in a black uniform popped over the fence with a black mask on and double tapped, fired twice and hit twice in the head.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.305]  I mean even if you're a good shot actually going over a fence line and killing somebody takes nerve and putting two shots at
[00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:59.310]  I think it was only 15 yards, but still, that's a good shot.
[00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.111]  Two shots, double tap to the head, splatter his brains everywhere.
[00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:04.892]  Then others would get pulled over.
[00:15:04.932 --> 00:15:08.313]  It looked like by police, you know, the person had been pulled over, no evidence of a wreck.
[00:15:08.573 --> 00:15:11.054]  They'd be ground in two inches of water in a puddle.
[00:15:11.714 --> 00:15:16.175]  Other people would jump off bridges to their deaths, their heads knocked in.
[00:15:17.096 --> 00:15:24.618]  And so, I mean, they definitely, the government definitely killed people to try to keep that myth going and to keep that propaganda bonanza working.
[00:15:27.142 --> 00:15:29.924]  So we should kind of rehash that and bring that into the Pat Tillman thing.
[00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:37.050]  And then I even forget, it was in several mainstream blogs last week, going, hey, was he killed?
[00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:38.612]  The family thinks they're more.
[00:15:38.932 --> 00:15:40.353]  He'd been criticizing the war.
[00:15:40.413 --> 00:15:41.194]  He told the family.
[00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:42.695]  Now that's come out mainstream news.
[00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:47.850]  But now others are questioning, and we like to do that.
[00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:58.394]  I mean, we generally know exactly what's going on from the pieces of the puzzle we've gotten from past MO of the New World Order's actions, because the way they behave is habitual.
[00:15:58.414 --> 00:16:06.277]  They just do it by rote, kind of obsessive compulsively over and over again, just with different dressing, basically, different frosting on it.
[00:16:06.297 --> 00:16:09.038]  It's the same cake, the same innards.
[00:16:10.305 --> 00:16:18.629]  And so now others have written it, Paul, so we can go and, oh, we mentioned on air, I mean, I mentioned on air six months ago that there could be foul play.
[00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:33.515]  Well, hell, the Army colonel that did the first review that didn't do a whitewash said that it was more than negligence and I think the word was a murder, homicide.
[00:16:34.796 --> 00:16:36.336]  Now, were guys jealous of him?
[00:16:36.356 --> 00:16:39.017]  All the gang member types that were in the Rangers nowadays?
[00:16:39.037 --> 00:16:40.737]  I mean, have you seen our military lately, folks?
[00:16:41.457 --> 00:16:43.998]  There's still some good people in there, but a lot of them, I mean, it's scary.
[00:16:46.038 --> 00:17:00.741]  I doubt it was probably some, you know, jealous gangbanger, because still, the esprit de corps of that, they tend to reform themselves, unless they're on base doing a, you know, hit for their commander, who may be lower in rank than them, but was a commander in the gang they're a member of.
[00:17:00.781 --> 00:17:03.222]  That takes precedence over the racial gangs.
[00:17:04.548 --> 00:17:06.149]  No, that is a slight chance.
[00:17:06.809 --> 00:17:10.391]  I don't know, 10-15% chance that if it's foul play, that was what it was.
[00:17:12.352 --> 00:17:20.497]  But no, it's about an 85% chance that if it's foul play, which the evidence pretty much shows it is, that it is government-op.
[00:17:21.698 --> 00:17:27.201]  He got multiple taps, and boy, Pat did really learn who he was working for, didn't he?
[00:17:28.942 --> 00:17:29.422]  You bet!
[00:17:30.022 --> 00:17:32.624]  You think you're going to go back and badmouth our war boy?
[00:17:36.624 --> 00:17:45.751]  And I've seen mainstream editorials where they have come out and said, well, yeah, the government lied about how he really died, but it was friendly fire.
[00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:47.032]  Look, we just made him a hero.
[00:17:47.112 --> 00:17:52.836]  We need this myth, this comfortable myth.
[00:17:53.456 --> 00:17:53.837]  So what?
[00:17:53.857 --> 00:17:55.458]  The government needs to lie it's a war.
[00:17:56.178 --> 00:18:01.942]  Well, the extension is just one more step to, well, the boy just doesn't know and doesn't see the bigger picture.
[00:18:02.443 --> 00:18:03.784]  We can't let this get out.
[00:18:05.114 --> 00:18:06.294]  Send in black ops.
[00:18:06.534 --> 00:18:07.675]  Take out Pat Tillman.
[00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:11.976]  So we've alluded to it quite a bit, but now others are saying it.
[00:18:12.496 --> 00:18:18.017]  And the family has come out, even with the official report now saying that it was friendly fire, they're saying that's a lie.
[00:18:18.417 --> 00:18:19.898]  Well, what are they saying there?
[00:18:20.518 --> 00:18:22.738]  The family needs to stop waiting around.
[00:18:22.758 --> 00:18:26.899]  You know, I got on there, and I doubt she heard about it through the show, but we do have a lot of listeners.
[00:18:27.759 --> 00:18:28.980]  She might have.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.700]  15, 20% chance.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.060]  Who knows?
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.561]  But I got on there the week before Private Lynch, Jessica Lynch, did go public.
[00:18:35.228 --> 00:18:46.534]  And I said, if you don't go public now, because all these members of your team and the people that went to rescue you were getting killed.
[00:18:46.594 --> 00:18:48.495]  I mean, in a one week period, a bunch of them got killed.
[00:18:50.135 --> 00:19:03.762]  I said, Lynch, if you keep playing along with this and the book deal they've got for you, like the Britain just got caught trying to do with their sailors that admittedly would stage book deals that the Ministry of Defense was using for propaganda and instant TV deals and the rest of it.
[00:19:05.246 --> 00:19:07.487]  And tell them they can profit from it as a way to pay them off.
[00:19:09.407 --> 00:19:10.348]  That blew up in their face.
[00:19:10.408 --> 00:19:16.850]  Well, with Lynch, I mean, she had a multi-million dollar book deal, and she came out and said, it's a fraud, it's a lie, it's a fable.
[00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.591]  And that saves your life, little girl.
[00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:24.792]  Because they would have probably let the book start coming out, and then you were going to die in a car wreck or something.
[00:19:24.812 --> 00:19:29.234]  And oh, look, the hero died in a car wreck, or the hero died of food poisoning.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.861]  Oh man, let's just even sell more of the books.
[00:19:33.421 --> 00:19:36.962]  And remember our hero, our new blonde haired girl.
[00:19:38.782 --> 00:19:39.802]  Alright, we got that.
[00:19:39.922 --> 00:19:41.363]  And big news on 9-11.
[00:19:42.703 --> 00:19:43.743]  We'll cover when we get back.
[00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:44.523]  Stay with me.
[00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:51.445]  Baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you.
[00:19:57.913 --> 00:20:03.139]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:11.369]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:20:11.629 --> 00:20:18.697]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:20:18.857 --> 00:20:20.138]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:26.121]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:20:26.301 --> 00:20:31.404]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:20:31.504 --> 00:20:40.390]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.952]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:46.374]  We're good.
[00:20:57.797 --> 00:20:59.718]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:00.158]  It's April 12, 2007.
[00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:01.059]  Gold is at $676.60.
[00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:04.240]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $699.31, $352.71 for half ounce, and $176.36 for quarter ounce coins.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:04.480]  That's $699.31, $352.71, $176.36.
[00:21:17.086 --> 00:21:20.668]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:21:20.728 --> 00:21:23.749]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:21:23.829 --> 00:21:32.913]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:21:33.233 --> 00:21:38.515]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:21:38.995 --> 00:21:41.298]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:21:41.338 --> 00:21:43.761]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:21:44.182 --> 00:21:47.426]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:51.210]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.530]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:51.731]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.681]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:01.062]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:22:01.302 --> 00:22:04.122]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:22:04.483 --> 00:22:07.243]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:22:07.783 --> 00:22:14.525]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:22:44.275 --> 00:22:44.675]  Call 877-873-9626.
[00:22:44.715 --> 00:22:44.895]  That's 877-873-9626.
[00:22:57.512 --> 00:22:57.913]  Attention!
[00:22:58.033 --> 00:23:00.856]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:23:01.156 --> 00:23:05.441]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:23:05.762 --> 00:23:06.463]  Listen closely.
[00:23:07.103 --> 00:23:12.910]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product considered to be the single most powerful
[00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:13.110]  I think so.
[00:23:29.725 --> 00:23:39.190]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:45.013]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:23:45.213 --> 00:23:48.775]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:23:49.015 --> 00:23:52.336]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[00:24:11.858 --> 00:24:15.301]  Was Kurt Vonnegut the 9-11 trooper?
[00:24:18.203 --> 00:24:19.483]  I'll tell you the next hour.
[00:24:23.886 --> 00:24:25.187]  Yeah, he died yesterday.
[00:24:26.328 --> 00:24:27.709]  He went on over the mountain.
[00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:33.093]  Into the wild blue yonder.
[00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:36.075]  Over the rainbow, as they say.
[00:24:36.835 --> 00:24:37.496]  Shuttle on.
[00:24:38.616 --> 00:24:39.297]  Have a good trip.
[00:24:40.609 --> 00:24:42.369]  Let's play a little bit of this song for Kurt.
[00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.730]  And then the man steps right up to the microphone.
[00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:53.111]  And says at last, just as the time bell rings.
[00:24:56.192 --> 00:24:57.592]  Good night.
[00:24:57.632 --> 00:25:00.893]  Now it's time to go home.
[00:25:00.913 --> 00:25:05.654]  Then he makes it fast with one more thing.
[00:25:09.936 --> 00:25:13.106]  We are the south ends.
[00:25:13.146 --> 00:25:15.856]  We are the south ends of Sweden.
[00:26:08.743 --> 00:26:10.843]  Kurt Vonnegut, dead at 84.
[00:26:10.883 --> 00:26:16.864]  Alright, I will comment on Kurt coming up later, but this is out of George Washington blog.
[00:26:16.884 --> 00:26:22.125]  We've got it up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now.
[00:26:22.145 --> 00:26:26.286]  911 family members filed petition with NIST.
[00:26:26.866 --> 00:26:36.788]  Bill Doyle and Bob McIlvaney today filed a petition with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST,
[00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:45.437]  Seeking correction of inaccurate factual statements and analysis in this report on the destruction of the Twin Towers.
[00:26:45.577 --> 00:26:48.359]  You see, you're going to have to answer for your scientific lies.
[00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:50.441]  Of course, they won't even say what made them fall now.
[00:26:50.481 --> 00:26:51.862]  They've been made to back off five times.
[00:26:52.503 --> 00:27:01.851]  Mr. Doyle is a representative of the largest group of 9-11 families, the Coalition of 9-11 Families, and lost his own son, Joey, in the collapse of the Twin Towers.
[00:27:02.992 --> 00:27:04.754]  Mr. McIlwain
[00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:10.812]  An outspoken 9-11 truth activist lost his son Bobby when the World Trade Centers were destroyed.
[00:27:11.532 --> 00:27:18.216]  Another prominent 9-11 family member supports the petition, but declined for personal reasons to sign it.
[00:27:18.697 --> 00:27:18.937]  Fear.
[00:27:19.577 --> 00:27:29.703]  Also signing the petition are physicist Dr. Stephen Jones, scientist and former site manager, Environmental Health Laboratories and Division of Underwriting Laboratories Kevin Ryan,
[00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:50.619]  Architect Richard Gage, a member of the American Institute of Architects, who has been a practicing architect for 20 years, has been responsible for the production and construction of documents from numerous steel-framed and fire-protected buildings for use in many different areas, including education, civic, rapid transit, and industrial use, and the group Scholars for 9-11 Truth and Justice.
[00:27:50.979 --> 00:27:52.300]  The petition can be read here.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.663]  It is also very strong and solid and very well
[00:27:57.589 --> 00:28:04.575]  It should be noted that this work on the petition commenced many months before NIST petitions prepared by others were put together.
[00:28:05.275 --> 00:28:07.057]  And it goes on here.
[00:28:09.099 --> 00:28:22.770]  The important point is that we last, what was it, Friday we had Steven Jones, Professor Jones, who's going to be here speaking Saturday night at the University of Texas, I think at like seven o'clock at night, right after I speak.
[00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.472]  And it's always great to see him and his really wonderful wife.
[00:28:28.072 --> 00:28:46.842]  But Professor Jones has now gotten samples from the World Trade Center Complex that have the aerosolized, congealed, alloy, perfectly spherical or close to perfectly spherical globulins.
[00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:53.801]  And then he was able to do the different microprobe and analysis of the electron microscopes of that.
[00:28:53.841 --> 00:29:00.044]  And again, just more confirmation of the explosive residue captured in that metal.
[00:29:01.004 --> 00:29:04.746]  We are going to get a report out in the next few days on that.
[00:29:06.987 --> 00:29:08.027]  So we have this report here.
[00:29:08.368 --> 00:29:10.629]  The toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:16.864 --> 00:29:17.144]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:17.284 --> 00:29:18.945]  The U.N.
[00:29:18.965 --> 00:29:25.930]  wants New York City cops to work for the United Nations.
[00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.650]  I'm not tending.
[00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.851]  It's the Associated Press.
[00:29:28.411 --> 00:29:30.733]  We'll tell you what's really behind all this when we get back.
[00:29:31.413 --> 00:29:36.836]  And then we'll get into the Texas Legislature takes on NAFTA and the North American Union Superhighways.
[00:29:37.037 --> 00:29:38.177]  Good news on that front.
[00:29:39.098 --> 00:29:42.260]  And your calls coming up throughout the broadcast today.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.764]  We also will play that James Bamford audio clip and several others.
[00:29:48.306 --> 00:29:49.307]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.327 --> 00:29:51.309]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.893]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.408 --> 00:30:04.889]  I love the new sandal style, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:09.170]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.551]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:18.933]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:30:19.253 --> 00:30:21.853]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:30:22.133 --> 00:30:25.614]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:30:25.914 --> 00:30:28.836]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:30:29.056 --> 00:30:33.798]  This podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:30:34.179 --> 00:30:35.679]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:30:35.939 --> 00:30:47.846]  You'll find Non-X gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Lane-Reed and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[00:30:51.669 --> 00:31:01.656]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:31:01.896 --> 00:31:02.757]  Look no further!
[00:31:03.057 --> 00:31:05.639]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:14.485]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:31:14.745 --> 00:31:15.026]  I think so.
[00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:32.567]  I'm good.
[00:31:58.587 --> 00:32:02.429]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[00:32:02.689 --> 00:32:06.551]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[00:32:06.932 --> 00:32:11.935]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[00:32:12.215 --> 00:32:23.401]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalinize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:28.083]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.

[00:34:01.312 --> 00:34:03.277]  It is Thursday, the 12th day of April, 2007.
[00:34:03.357 --> 00:34:03.517]  Now...
[00:34:10.299 --> 00:34:12.380]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.702]  Melissa, Habib, Chris, Richard, DW, and many others.
[00:34:15.742 --> 00:34:20.845]  The toll-free number to join us on air, of course, is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:20.966 --> 00:34:34.754]  I have a great online video and bookstore, and we have all the most important films, the hottest, latest, most informative documentaries, like Iraq for Sale by the award-winning documentary filmmaker Robert Greenwald.
[00:34:35.592 --> 00:34:40.135]  Iraq for sale, the war profiteers, who's getting killed and who's making a killing.
[00:34:40.656 --> 00:34:47.661]  We have the great new documentary by Dr. Nick Begich, Mind Control, A Brave New World or Enhancing Human Performance.
[00:34:49.583 --> 00:34:52.405]  Also 9-11 Press for Truth with the Jersey Girls.
[00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:57.749]  This is for anybody that says the victims all love George Bush and believe the Al-Qaeda carried out the attacks.
[00:34:57.769 --> 00:34:58.849]  Well, you need to get in this video.
[00:34:58.869 --> 00:35:02.192]  9-11 Press for Truth.
[00:35:03.052 --> 00:35:06.817]  Of course, my new film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:35:07.918 --> 00:35:10.041]  What did Dylan Avery, director of Loose Change, say about it?
[00:35:10.401 --> 00:35:12.764]  Terror Storm is a new standard in documentary filmmaking.
[00:35:13.245 --> 00:35:15.428]  Alex Jones knocks it out of the park yet again.
[00:35:16.241 --> 00:35:19.862]  And as the headline, the terrorists aren't who you think they are.
[00:35:20.402 --> 00:35:28.385]  Throughout history, criminal elites inside governments have carried out terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:35:28.785 --> 00:35:38.407]  TerrorStorm reveals how, in the last hundred years, Western leaders have repeatedly murdered their own citizens while posing as their saviors.
[00:35:38.828 --> 00:35:43.329]  In TerrorStorm, you will discover that the September 11th terrorist attacks in London
[00:35:44.179 --> 00:35:46.842]  And many other terrorist events were self-inflicted wounds.
[00:35:47.182 --> 00:35:53.348]  You will witness British Special Forces troops caught in the act of staging terror attacks in Iraq, and see official U.S.
[00:35:53.368 --> 00:35:57.552]  government documents laying out plans to hijack passenger planes by remote control.
[00:35:57.873 --> 00:36:05.280]  You will learn how the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the U.S.-backed Iranian coup of 53 are all interconnected false flag terror events.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:22.289]  This powerful documentary explores the mindset of the average brainwashed westerner and delves deeply into the systems of control which have been significantly and scientifically crafted to imprison their minds and keep their eyes closed to the realities of the world around them.
[00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.831]  I start babbling when I try to hurry, but this is important.
[00:36:25.852 --> 00:36:26.572]  I'm going to take my time.
[00:36:27.529 --> 00:36:29.470]  Extras and special features.
[00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:34.834]  Speeches and commentary from the historic 9-11 and the Neoconagentist Symposium in Los Angeles, California.
[00:36:35.154 --> 00:36:54.045]  Featuring BYU physics professor Stephen E. Jones, actor and activist Charlie Sheen, Star Wars program presenter Lieutenant Colonel Bob Bowman, filmmaker Alex Jones, 9-11 Scholars for Truth founder James Fetzer, terrorism expert and historian Webster G. Tarpley, and then there's Martial Law and Dark Secrets of the South Bohemian Grove film trailers.
[00:36:54.305 --> 00:36:57.047]  So it's over three hours on the film with the extras.
[00:36:58.912 --> 00:36:59.834]  And it's a must-have.
[00:36:59.914 --> 00:37:02.838]  And then last but not least of just some of the things I'm plugging here.
[00:37:02.918 --> 00:37:04.300]  Well, actually two things I want to tell you about.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.862]  Riddles in Stone.
[00:37:06.242 --> 00:37:07.604]  This just came out a few weeks ago.
[00:37:08.065 --> 00:37:10.127]  The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:13.372]  Part 2 and Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings.
[00:37:14.173 --> 00:37:16.656]  Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[00:37:17.156 --> 00:37:19.379]  The second volume in the Secret Mysteries series.
[00:37:19.719 --> 00:37:23.022]  Part two explores the highly controversial subject of American's capital.
[00:37:23.543 --> 00:37:29.089]  Was the city built to reflect the majesty of American freedom or the hidden agenda of secret societies?
[00:37:29.509 --> 00:37:34.515]  With every major cornerstone laid by Freemasons, was the city built as a Masonic pattern?
[00:37:35.195 --> 00:37:57.849]  Embark upon an incredible journey as Riddles interviews experts on both sides of the heated debate, watches Freemasons apologists defend some of the most direct and hard-hitting questions concerning the influence of masonry in America and its symbolism in Washington, D.C., along with them are leading researchers who maintain that the occult architecture permeates the city and conceals a secret agenda.
[00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.990]  And it goes on, folks.
[00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.611]  You need to get Riddles and Stone at infowars.com.
[00:38:02.652 --> 00:38:07.555]  Or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:38:09.395 --> 00:38:11.837]  Again that number is 888-253-3139.
[00:38:12.257 --> 00:38:18.600]  Or you can simply get another powerful film or get them all together.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:24.623]  You can get this with Riddles in Stone and get a big discount or get it with America Freedom to Fascism.
[00:38:24.943 --> 00:38:27.785]  You can get America Freedom to Fascism with Terror Storm and get a big discount.
[00:38:28.285 --> 00:38:30.386]  Aaron Russo's America Freedom to Fascism
[00:38:31.115 --> 00:38:32.716]  This is the movie that you must see.
[00:38:32.756 --> 00:38:35.697]  This is the movie the government must keep you from seeing.
[00:38:35.717 --> 00:38:37.517]  That's what Mike Rivero said.
[00:38:38.658 --> 00:38:45.380]  Also from Black Star News, the thought-provoking clarion call for the masses to wake up before it's too late.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.621]  And the 60-second preview said, see the cinematic call to arms.
[00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:51.942]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:38:52.002 --> 00:38:57.744]  The greatest and scariest film you'll see this year makes Fahrenheit 9-11 look like Bambi.
[00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.993]  And it really is an important film.
[00:39:01.093 --> 00:39:02.434]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:39:02.855 --> 00:39:06.659]  This is updated from what you saw in the theaters when it was in theaters last year.
[00:39:07.059 --> 00:39:07.640]  And we have it.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.281]  Not a duplicate.
[00:39:09.321 --> 00:39:10.002]  Not a copy.
[00:39:10.282 --> 00:39:11.203]  Not the old version.
[00:39:11.924 --> 00:39:13.426]  When you get this, you actually support.
[00:39:15.368 --> 00:39:16.269]  And we need your support.
[00:39:16.649 --> 00:39:19.132]  Eric Russo, the filmmaker who's fighting
[00:39:20.327 --> 00:39:22.529]  through his life against cancer right now.
[00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:24.230]  We pray for him every day in my family.
[00:39:24.771 --> 00:39:33.398]  So all those films available and more at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or simply call toll free 888-253-3139 or just write to me.
[00:39:33.418 --> 00:39:36.820]  I'm Alex Jones and it's 3001 South Lamar Suite 100 Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:53.926]  And then, of course, there's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:39:53.966 --> 00:40:02.573]  You can see all 15 of my films, hundreds of weekly TV reports, my best audio interviews, literally thousands of pieces of media, three-plus years up and running.
[00:40:02.913 --> 00:40:10.519]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, takes about 60 seconds to sign up and get your passcode at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:40:12.981 --> 00:40:21.048]  Okay, let me cover this, and I'm just going to start taking calls through this hour, into the next hour, and then continue with some audio clips and other key news.
[00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.711]  You and Once New York City Cops for Peacekeeping
[00:40:40.324 --> 00:40:41.566]  This is all very interesting.
[00:40:41.786 --> 00:40:43.087]  Oh, no big deal.
[00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.408]  Oh, it's just a request.
[00:40:44.448 --> 00:40:47.531]  Oh, the Mexican troops just helped with Katrina.
[00:40:47.831 --> 00:40:50.333]  Oh, the Norwegian AWACS just helped on 9-11.
[00:40:50.894 --> 00:40:53.736]  Oh, the German Air Force is here just helping with our airspace.
[00:40:54.597 --> 00:40:57.960]  Oh, by the way, we signed deals with the Mexican and Canadian government.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.101]  We're good to go.
[00:41:10.402 --> 00:41:16.787]  You know, two dozen Austin cops in a special program are being internationally deputized by the U.N.
[00:41:16.827 --> 00:41:27.055]  and their counterpart, 24 cops from Tokyo, are coming here and it's all part of an international program where they can go arrest people in Japan and they can come here and arrest people in the U.S.
[00:41:27.355 --> 00:41:30.137]  You know, I'm just watching, didn't tape it.
[00:41:30.518 --> 00:41:32.139]  I literally rarely watch TV.
[00:41:32.279 --> 00:41:33.180]  Imagine what I'm missing.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:38.404]  I turn on News 8, local, they only have like five of them in the country, it's CNN local.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.803]  And I turn on News 8, and there's a five-minute report about how great it is.
[00:41:45.083 --> 00:41:46.904]  And I'm scrambling to tape it, and by then it's over.
[00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:50.266]  That was like five years ago.
[00:41:50.286 --> 00:41:53.167]  That was back in the day before I even had a DVR on my TV in my house.
[00:41:53.207 --> 00:41:54.708]  But then I watch a little TV.
[00:41:54.768 --> 00:41:57.590]  I don't have trouble getting recorded.
[00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:01.352]  Then I'm too busy to haul the DVR down to the office and get the stuff I do record.
[00:42:04.533 --> 00:42:06.494]  Again, we're being hit by a thousand punches.
[00:42:06.534 --> 00:42:07.595]  I don't even know how to cover this.
[00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:09.476]  But let me get to the article.
[00:42:11.204 --> 00:42:11.444]  U.N.
[00:42:11.505 --> 00:42:13.887]  wants New York City cops for peacekeeping.
[00:42:15.148 --> 00:42:17.871]  Associated Press, April 12th.
[00:42:18.091 --> 00:42:23.796]  I was about to say yesterday because I read this last night, but I guess it was like 1.30 at my house.
[00:42:23.816 --> 00:42:24.637]  So yeah, this is today.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:27.740]  U.N.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.802]  wants New York City cops for peacekeeping.
[00:42:31.043 --> 00:42:34.046]  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon
[00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:42.336]  Asked New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Wednesday whether some of the city's police officers could be deployed with UN peacekeeping missions.
[00:42:43.057 --> 00:42:48.642]  Recruiting police for the UN's 16 peacekeeping missions around the globe has been historically challenging.
[00:42:49.362 --> 00:42:52.705]  Oh, see, they've got a challenge and they need help.
[00:42:52.765 --> 00:42:53.686]  That's all it is.
[00:42:53.726 --> 00:42:54.767]  They just need some help.
[00:42:55.227 --> 00:42:56.108]  We need some help.
[00:42:56.128 --> 00:42:57.950]  The Germans and Mexicans are here.
[00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.771]  There are other troops.
[00:43:02.356 --> 00:43:10.038]  New York City has one of the most diversified police forces around and I think the Secretary General would like to explore possibilities.
[00:43:10.518 --> 00:43:10.678]  U.N.
[00:43:10.698 --> 00:43:20.580]  Deputy Spokesman Marie Okabe said before the meeting, getting police to join peacekeeping operations is one of the high priorities for the U.N.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.921]  It goes on, Bloomberg left the meeting without speaking to reporters
[00:43:26.753 --> 00:43:31.638]  It says Stu Loeser, the mayor's spokesman, said that his office had no comment.
[00:43:32.098 --> 00:43:40.266]  New York City has recently fallen short on its police recruiting goals, so it's unclear if it would have any officers to spare for international peacekeeping.
[00:43:40.666 --> 00:43:46.752]  The UN Peacekeeping Department said 321 American police officers are currently involved in missions abroad.
[00:43:46.772 --> 00:43:47.833]  That's a lot more than that.
[00:43:48.574 --> 00:43:51.417]  I guess that means they stay in the force somehow.
[00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:54.802]  Thousands of cops go and become mercs for him.
[00:43:55.663 --> 00:44:06.108]  I've been in the YMCA, coming out of the showers and seeing the bulletin board with ads for cops for the UN and cops standing around looking at it, going, I'm going to join!
[00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:14.532]  The UN Peacekeeping Department said 321 American police officers are currently involved in the mission abroad, primarily training local police.
[00:44:14.992 --> 00:44:20.875]  Of those, 225 are in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia, and others are in Haiti, Liberia, and Sudan.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:32.065]  Now, this is all part of the slow process of marinating us in this.
[00:44:34.366 --> 00:44:35.707]  Every major city in the U.S.
[00:44:35.747 --> 00:44:36.588]  has sister cities.
[00:44:36.648 --> 00:44:37.328]  It's called U.N.
[00:44:37.368 --> 00:44:42.251]  munialization, where the cities sign agreements and treaties and contracts with foreign cities.
[00:44:44.553 --> 00:44:45.193]  It's all U.N.
[00:44:45.253 --> 00:44:45.854]  controlled.
[00:44:45.974 --> 00:44:52.718]  UNESCO, that Bush had his wife signed back onto three years ago, and a treaty signing in Paris, in Paris, with Jacques Chirac.
[00:44:54.759 --> 00:45:09.686]  They came right out and that puts our universities, our public lands, the regulations under treaty agreement so that federal agencies have to adopt via treaty the guidelines of the UN just like the WTO, the IMF, the World Bank, the EXIM.
[00:45:10.686 --> 00:45:15.228]  The World Health Organization, they all set the standards and I got a call yesterday and I did Google and I did confirm.
[00:45:15.568 --> 00:45:21.971]  Chertoff just gave a speech two weeks ago, he's been giving several, saying we're soon going to be under total international law and that's what we follow.
[00:45:22.451 --> 00:45:26.412]  Member of the Supreme Court Justices, in fact I wrote notes on this, I've got to put that in the film.
[00:45:27.733 --> 00:45:30.474]  Supreme Court Justices.
[00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:32.195]  I'm making a film right now about all this.
[00:45:32.295 --> 00:45:35.256]  There's so much evidence I can't like grasp it all in my head.
[00:45:36.156 --> 00:45:40.038]  Supreme Court Justices say we are
[00:45:41.267 --> 00:45:48.449]  Under international law, and I remember to put that in the pile, I forgot to put that in the big folder, except for putting it in the film.
[00:45:48.489 --> 00:45:56.011]  Remember all those announcements a few years ago, and continually, oh yeah, well the Supreme Court then has the World Court above it, and other international agreements.
[00:45:56.931 --> 00:46:00.472]  See, oh, and they're now bringing it into court cases as precedent!
[00:46:00.972 --> 00:46:02.392]  Other people's laws!
[00:46:02.952 --> 00:46:06.373]  Places that don't have due process, or innocent until proven guilty.
[00:46:09.924 --> 00:46:12.946]  And sure enough, I got articles today where... Oh, by the way!
[00:46:14.748 --> 00:46:15.048]  You know what?
[00:46:15.088 --> 00:46:18.210]  I'll cover it later, but remind me if I don't get into it.
[00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:25.435]  The New York Times is reporting... the Justice Department report says, don't worry, there's really no election fraud.
[00:46:26.956 --> 00:46:28.778]  I mean, what a joke, folks!
[00:46:30.339 --> 00:46:34.482]  And then they put a spin on it, like, well, the Justice Department didn't want to release it, but it leaked.
[00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:38.191]  To add to it, like that adds, I mean, all these tricks they play.
[00:46:38.692 --> 00:46:39.752]  Oh, it's leaked!
[00:46:40.072 --> 00:46:45.935]  Oh, that, that really adds credibility that this wasn't for us to see, but it's in the New York Times.
[00:46:47.795 --> 00:46:53.738]  If you believe it, I got some, you know, Florida swampland I'm ready to sell you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:54.418 --> 00:46:59.300]  I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you on the surface of the moon.
[00:46:59.561 --> 00:47:02.042]  I mean, it's just, when does it end?
[00:47:02.842 --> 00:47:04.823]  The tricks they play and the stuff they do.
[00:47:05.683 --> 00:47:15.887]  Oh, the Justice Department, complete criminals, butchering the entire Bill of Rights, lying to everyone, writing up memos saying they can torture children with pliers.
[00:47:16.968 --> 00:47:19.149]  I'm sorry, with vice grips.
[00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:31.034]  They say, the President's Enron lawyer, Alberto Gonzalez, and John Yoo and the rest of this gaggle of crooks, they say
[00:47:32.631 --> 00:47:36.973]  That'd be like if you had Al Capone up on the stand and, oh, Al Capone says he's not a gangster.
[00:47:37.673 --> 00:47:43.956]  Al Capone says he doesn't own any whore houses or gambling houses or liquor houses.
[00:47:44.877 --> 00:47:46.998]  Al Capone says he doesn't own a Tommy Gun.
[00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:49.739]  Al Capone says he doesn't wear trench coats.
[00:47:50.519 --> 00:47:51.460]  Al Capone says.
[00:47:57.427 --> 00:48:01.951]  Oh look, everybody, there's no problem now with the voting.
[00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:04.473]  The Justice Department says so.
[00:48:04.493 --> 00:48:07.535]  Alright, I said remind me later.
[00:48:07.555 --> 00:48:08.416]  I want to go over the article.
[00:48:10.617 --> 00:48:13.159]  Let's go ahead and go to Melissa in Florida.
[00:48:13.179 --> 00:48:14.180]  Thanks for holding, Melissa.
[00:48:16.282 --> 00:48:22.987]  Yes, I don't know if you remember after 9-11, the FBI gets on the television and wants information.
[00:48:23.027 --> 00:48:23.747]  That'll help them.
[00:48:25.126 --> 00:48:26.707]  But I found a website.
[00:48:26.747 --> 00:48:28.868]  I believe it was binladen.com.
[00:48:29.328 --> 00:48:32.030]  I believe the organization was the Bin Laden Group.
[00:48:32.971 --> 00:48:38.434]  And I looked on their contact list and there was a lot of American citizens that worked for them.
[00:48:39.654 --> 00:48:42.596]  So being naive, I sent that in to the FBI.
[00:48:43.857 --> 00:48:47.559]  For the past five years, our surveillance has been harassed.
[00:48:52.034 --> 00:48:52.575]  Anything else?
[00:48:52.615 --> 00:48:53.555]  What else is going on?
[00:48:53.575 --> 00:48:54.036]  That's it.
[00:48:54.356 --> 00:48:57.579]  Well, there's a lot more going on, but I'm not going to get into it today.
[00:48:58.639 --> 00:49:06.266]  Well, you know, that's really important, the point you raise, and I appreciate your call, Melissa, and I'm sorry that's happening to you, but, you know, we can't give in to fear.
[00:49:07.507 --> 00:49:18.256]  The truth is, is that there's surveillance going on all the time, and it's a panoptagon psychological tactic to then surveil a few times, and you think you're constantly being surveilled.
[00:49:18.276 --> 00:49:19.897]  They don't have the forces to do it.
[00:49:20.718 --> 00:49:26.821]  All they can do is try to encourage massive spying, massive tattletaling by the society.
[00:49:26.841 --> 00:49:33.725]  That's why you see constant national ad council, you know, radio, TV, print ads about spying on your neighbor.
[00:49:33.765 --> 00:49:37.147]  First it's look for terrorists, and a year later, oh, and pot smokers.
[00:49:37.947 --> 00:49:41.409]  Because there's no real terrorists, but then they make pot smoking terrorism, which they actually have.
[00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:45.191]  Or a fist fight at a school, something most of us did.
[00:49:45.871 --> 00:49:47.672]  I've got articles where they charge them as terrorists.
[00:49:47.712 --> 00:49:49.513]  Now they say, well, hitting somebody was terrorism.
[00:49:51.152 --> 00:49:52.332]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[00:49:52.352 --> 00:49:55.393]  They're arresting five-year-olds, six-year-olds, they're arresting people for no reason.
[00:49:55.933 --> 00:49:57.293]  It's about getting you into the system.
[00:49:59.234 --> 00:50:05.715]  But yeah, Saddam had no connections to Al-Qaeda, but the government said he did, and said he was behind the attacks.
[00:50:05.875 --> 00:50:06.795]  Now they've admitted he wasn't.
[00:50:08.335 --> 00:50:13.796]  But the Carlisle group, the Bushes, have just more connections than anybody else.
[00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:15.797]  The Wall Street Journal wrote about it two months before 9-11.
[00:50:18.184 --> 00:50:22.987]  And then they try to spin and say, it's not really true, we didn't fly the Bin Laden's out.
[00:50:23.527 --> 00:50:28.830]  Miami Herald Associated Press, in the two and three days after, they flew out 160 plus.
[00:50:30.691 --> 00:50:32.251]  There were at least five flights.
[00:50:33.412 --> 00:50:39.295]  Now, the media did spin though, and talked about people that flew out two weeks later, when the airband was lifted, there were more waves.
[00:50:39.935 --> 00:50:43.437]  So they all play dog and pony shows, but those tricks work on most people.
[00:50:43.918 --> 00:50:44.598]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.463 --> 00:51:01.564]  It's here!
[00:51:01.764 --> 00:51:06.546]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:06.926 --> 00:51:14.528]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:15.262 --> 00:51:22.306]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:22.706 --> 00:51:34.152]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:34.432 --> 00:51:38.134]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:38.375 --> 00:51:40.356]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:40.676 --> 00:51:44.518]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:03.812 --> 00:52:07.975]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:08.396 --> 00:52:09.236]  So what do you do?
[00:52:09.536 --> 00:52:14.100]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.722]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:52:17.203 --> 00:52:18.084]  Sheltering in Place!

[00:53:12.845 --> 00:53:17.745]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:17.945 --> 00:53:26.887]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:07.311 --> 00:54:09.753]  Alright, final segment of this hour.
[00:54:09.793 --> 00:54:13.897]  Let's go ahead and keep going to your calls here.
[00:54:13.957 --> 00:54:19.702]  Habib in New York, then Chris Richard, B.W., Michael and others.
[00:54:19.742 --> 00:54:22.204]  Go ahead Habib, you're on the air.
[00:54:33.607 --> 00:54:34.768]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[00:54:34.808 --> 00:54:37.050]  Been a long listener for almost a year now.
[00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.070]  Well, thanks for tuning in.
[00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:38.931]  What's on your mind today?
[00:54:39.411 --> 00:54:41.433]  Yes, I had two questions.
[00:54:41.593 --> 00:54:44.195]  One about, both of them related to 9-11.
[00:54:44.675 --> 00:54:52.761]  My first question was, how do you respond to those who say that even though fire didn't melt the steel in the building, it weakened it, so it crushed on itself?
[00:54:54.315 --> 00:54:56.057]  Well, that had never happened before.
[00:54:56.237 --> 00:54:58.019]  Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane.
[00:54:58.099 --> 00:55:04.225]  NIST now says they don't know why 7 fell, but the debunkers still keep using their disproven reasons.
[00:55:05.426 --> 00:55:09.008]  Also, you have a woman standing in the hole, and other people.
[00:55:09.308 --> 00:55:13.109]  You have black smoke, meaning it was 400 to 550 degrees maximum.
[00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:15.970]  You have giant steel columns, four foot around.
[00:55:16.291 --> 00:55:23.473]  You have NIST and FEMA saying there were no central columns in the building when there were 47 four foot around ones with fireproofing all around it.
[00:55:24.194 --> 00:55:31.056]  I mean, your iron stove, your steel stove, even your aluminum stove doesn't melt when you're cooking something at 550 degrees for a hundred years.
[00:55:33.375 --> 00:55:36.677]  And it doesn't weaken to any great degree.
[00:55:36.837 --> 00:55:39.899]  And stuff would have sloughed off if something did weaken.
[00:55:40.199 --> 00:55:48.203]  We've seen buildings burn for days with white hot flames and then small supports will kind of melt and bend down and hang, but none of the big ones even move.
[00:55:48.924 --> 00:55:52.085]  And so it's a total and complete fraud and the blueprints are now public.
[00:55:52.385 --> 00:55:55.607]  They even tried to lie about the blueprints, but the blueprints are now public for the towers.
[00:55:56.448 --> 00:55:59.049]  And it's just absolutely amazing the type of spin we're seeing.
[00:55:59.778 --> 00:56:02.821]  Yeah, so I guess Building 7 is sort of a big key over here.
[00:56:04.663 --> 00:56:09.408]  My second question was, what is your personal opinion on Osama Bin Laden?
[00:56:09.448 --> 00:56:13.592]  Obviously he has his own agenda, whether or not he's related to the U.S., but...
[00:56:14.128 --> 00:56:17.230]  As of your best knowledge, do you think he's in bed with the U.S.
[00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:18.491]  or what's up with him?
[00:56:18.531 --> 00:56:19.171]  Do you think?
[00:56:19.571 --> 00:56:20.732]  Absolutely in bed.
[00:56:21.152 --> 00:56:24.714]  The elite Saudis are in bed with the New World Order.
[00:56:24.755 --> 00:56:25.855]  I wouldn't even say the U.S.
[00:56:26.896 --> 00:56:27.996]  I wouldn't call it the Iraqis.
[00:56:28.037 --> 00:56:29.177]  I wouldn't call it the Jews.
[00:56:29.217 --> 00:56:30.398]  I wouldn't call it the U.S.
[00:56:30.418 --> 00:56:31.459]  I wouldn't call it any group.
[00:56:32.339 --> 00:56:37.081]  You know, evil people that are in control who combine forces together and invest together.
[00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:39.042]  I mean, look at who owns Carlisle.
[00:56:39.342 --> 00:56:43.203]  The Bin Ladens, the Queen of England, the Bushes, James Baker, George Shultz.
[00:56:43.223 --> 00:56:44.344]  I mean, a handful of people.
[00:56:44.764 --> 00:56:46.145]  And they literally vacation together.
[00:56:46.165 --> 00:56:46.985]  They hang out together.
[00:56:47.285 --> 00:56:48.786]  Bin Laden was trained in the U.S.
[00:56:48.946 --> 00:56:57.009]  Osama Bin Laden was known to be the main conduit commander for the CIA in the Mujahideen in the war from 1979 until what?
[00:56:57.289 --> 00:56:57.389]  Until 87, 88.
[00:57:02.151 --> 00:57:05.555]  Yeah, yeah, around 89, but... Yeah, but I mean, let me just go back here, though.
[00:57:06.395 --> 00:57:12.041]  So, you know, again, people can't have their cake and eat it, too, you know, because some Arabs are like, no, no, the U.S.
[00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:18.147]  didn't do it, or Israel didn't do it, our beloved, look how tough us, you know, Muslims are, you know, you don't think we're swearing up to do this?
[00:57:18.648 --> 00:57:21.330]  You know, bin Laden couldn't make NORAD stand down.
[00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:23.653]  Bin Laden couldn't do all these things.
[00:57:24.013 --> 00:57:25.895]  Now, I know in one statement, bin Laden said,
[00:57:26.954 --> 00:57:55.907]  That he didn't do it, and then another, he supposedly said he did, and then Bandar Bush, you know, Sheikh Bandar, the Prince Bandar, who was on Larry King a few years ago said, oh, he was on, I'm going to let you talk a minute, I'm trying to answer your question properly, he was on Larry King Live, and Larry King Live was calling Bin Laden names, I've got to get a tape of this, the kind of things I see, this is just what I caught, folks, this is what I catch, I'm sure you saw it, he was calling Bin Laden bad names, and Bandar Bush said,
[00:57:57.291 --> 00:57:58.368]  Don't talk bad about me, Juan!
[00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:01.361]  I mean, that's how sick this is.
[00:58:01.421 --> 00:58:06.042]  At those higher levels, I guarantee you they sit around and Bush talks about how great a job he did.
[00:58:06.402 --> 00:58:13.464]  The info we have is that Bin Laden died in and around 9-11, or shortly after, of kidney failure.
[00:58:13.964 --> 00:58:14.604]  That was one reason.
[00:58:14.664 --> 00:58:16.764]  And then he becomes a hero in the Middle East.
[00:58:17.065 --> 00:58:21.585]  His family makes an additional $3 billion that year alone on Karloff Group stock increases.
[00:58:22.886 --> 00:58:23.746]  Stay there, Habib.
[00:58:23.786 --> 00:58:25.246]  We'll come back and we'll get your take on it.
[00:58:25.446 --> 00:58:26.466]  If you disagree, that's fine.
[00:58:26.827 --> 00:58:27.967]  I'm just giving you the facts here.
[00:58:28.587 --> 00:58:28.847]  Okay?
[00:58:29.511 --> 00:58:32.072]  I mean, their families have been working for British Intel since 1918.
[00:58:33.373 --> 00:58:35.714]  They are the British arm in Saudi Arabia.
[00:58:37.815 --> 00:58:42.657]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:42.697 --> 00:58:42.977]  Big Brother.
[00:58:42.997 --> 00:58:43.477]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:57.265 --> 00:58:58.385]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:59.045 --> 00:58:59.846]  You want answers?
[00:59:00.606 --> 00:59:01.586]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:02.146 --> 00:59:06.127]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:06.347 --> 00:59:10.448]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:28.386 --> 00:59:31.668]  Alright, we're back, ladies and gentlemen, into the second hour.
[00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:48.700]  I'm going to get more into New York police having meetings, the mayor, Bloomberg, having meetings with the UN about supplying the UN with its peacekeeping enforcers, its world government keeping enforcers, as the merger of our police and the UN intensifies.
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:51.341]  Also more on, was Pat Tillman killed?
[00:59:51.882 --> 00:59:54.103]  Kurt Vonnegut did die at 84 yesterday.
[00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:55.244]  I've got some comments about
[00:59:56.076 --> 01:00:03.194]  My interesting interactions through, well we'll just talk about Kurt Vonnegut and was he a 9-11 truther?
[01:00:04.967 --> 01:00:09.269]  And I've got a bunch of other news, some good news about North American Union in trouble right here in Texas.
[01:00:09.789 --> 01:00:10.630]  Some good news there.
[01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:12.791]  Right now, let's go back to Habib in New York.
[01:00:12.811 --> 01:00:14.772]  We'll go to Chris, Richard, DW, Michael, and others.
[01:00:15.192 --> 01:00:18.153]  Habib is saying, you know, is Bin Laden CIA, isn't he?
[01:00:18.574 --> 01:00:23.396]  What's his real relationship to the New World Order, to the 9-11 attacks?
[01:00:23.436 --> 01:00:26.557]  I mean, what are you getting at, or what are you asking, or what are you saying?
[01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:31.680]  No, I mean, like, I totally, I mean, I don't say that I'm against you.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.961]  I'm just trying to figure out what he really is.
[01:00:34.694 --> 01:00:39.276]  I mean, like, are you saying that he's sort of like Saddam, you know, that they used him and then they betrayed him?
[01:00:39.776 --> 01:00:51.281]  Because the perspective I get from many people, and I know some pretty people that are out there, they're like, you know, he's a good guy, I mean, from an extremist point of view, perhaps.
[01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:54.222]  You know, he's just totally against the U.S.
[01:00:54.803 --> 01:00:57.524]  But the thing is, like, when you said he supported, I mean, the U.S.
[01:00:57.564 --> 01:01:03.006]  supported him during the Afghan-Soviet war, one could argue that, you know, well,
[01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:07.379]  You know, they were supporting him for that time because they had to fight the Soviets.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.761]  Yeah, but you're not listening to me.
[01:01:10.961 --> 01:01:29.154]  See, they've had Poles in the Middle East, and half of them, and of course you can go find the Pole, it might be 35 ones and 61, but generally around half believe that the government, you know, our government carried out the attacks, that half's right, and the other half are idiots and, you know, can't get over the emotion
[01:01:29.972 --> 01:01:31.573]  You know, just like the average American.
[01:01:31.593 --> 01:01:41.601]  And no, no, you know, we have a right to strike back after all the bombings and death and carnage and puppet dictators and torture.
[01:01:41.661 --> 01:01:43.262]  No, we're striking back.
[01:01:43.722 --> 01:01:45.844]  That is just not the case from the evidence.
[01:01:46.044 --> 01:01:54.531]  And so, those groups out there that believe that and play along with that help the New World Order come in and blow the Middle East and Central Asia into dust.
[01:01:56.745 --> 01:02:01.229]  Bin Laden, sir, again, people aren't looking at the facts.
[01:02:03.532 --> 01:02:04.512]  I mean, let me go over this for you.
[01:02:05.173 --> 01:02:09.457]  Osama Bin Laden, his supposed hijackers were trained at U.S.
[01:02:09.497 --> 01:02:10.418]  military bases.
[01:02:11.018 --> 01:02:15.563]  When they go out to an Al-Qaeda summit in Malaysia, and U.S.
[01:02:15.623 --> 01:02:19.987]  embassies would block them coming back in, they would be told by the State Department they're CIA officers.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.621]  They're in anti-terror ops.
[01:02:22.922 --> 01:02:23.982]  Those are cover identities.
[01:02:24.022 --> 01:02:24.703]  Let them back in.
[01:02:25.063 --> 01:02:26.824]  These are colonels and embassy heads.
[01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:28.105]  I mean, this is on record.
[01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:35.610]  This is AP, San Jose Mercury News, Newsweek, Pensacola News Journal.
[01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:37.551]  I mean, this is confirmed.
[01:02:38.111 --> 01:02:38.511]  Okay?
[01:02:38.992 --> 01:02:41.874]  And again, the New World Order gives you propaganda.
[01:02:42.034 --> 01:02:45.596]  I mean, they have these fake bin Laden statements that come out.
[01:02:46.787 --> 01:02:48.728]  They have him say stuff that makes sense.
[01:02:48.768 --> 01:02:54.692]  They have him put out propaganda that actually has real grievances and a lot of it makes sense.
[01:02:55.412 --> 01:02:57.753]  Because you wouldn't take the bait if it didn't make sense.
[01:02:58.113 --> 01:03:01.595]  It's meant to get you all hyped up as a Muslim at the same time.
[01:03:02.316 --> 01:03:05.498]  And then it's meant to get Christians all hyped up.
[01:03:05.858 --> 01:03:07.119]  I agree with you completely.
[01:03:07.139 --> 01:03:14.343]  Thank you for listening to my call and I just want to share a funny story with you about how I discovered your show and you.
[01:03:15.222 --> 01:03:23.726]  It was a few years back, I was trying to download Fahrenheit 9-11, then all of a sudden somebody put that under the search engine, but it was actually your movie, and I was like, huh?
[01:03:25.106 --> 01:03:30.929]  Well, that's how a lot of people found us, is people listed Fahrenheit 9-11 online as Road to Tyranny, correct?
[01:03:31.529 --> 01:03:32.490]  That was exactly it.
[01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:36.051]  Absolutely, yeah, Road to Tyranny caused a chain reaction.
[01:03:36.651 --> 01:03:38.152]  The first 9-11 film.
[01:03:38.612 --> 01:03:40.453]  And it led to much of what you see today.
[01:03:40.473 --> 01:03:42.174]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:03:50.054 --> 01:03:50.815]  Terrorism!
[01:03:50.975 --> 01:03:51.735]  Terrorism!
[01:03:51.835 --> 01:03:57.920]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.761]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:02.463]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:04:02.863 --> 01:04:17.433]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:17.473 --> 01:04:17.774]  government.
[01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.755]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:04:20.135 --> 01:04:26.057]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:26.177 --> 01:04:30.678]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:04:52.572 --> 01:04:58.041]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:58.402 --> 01:05:06.015]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:13.792]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:14.173 --> 01:05:25.616]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:25.916 --> 01:05:29.838]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:29.878 --> 01:05:31.798]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:32.139 --> 01:05:35.980]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:50.979 --> 01:05:56.420]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:01.581]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:06:01.961 --> 01:06:04.602]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:05.082 --> 01:06:08.503]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:09.263 --> 01:06:13.584]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:14.024 --> 01:06:17.204]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:17.804 --> 01:06:20.645]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:21.443 --> 01:06:23.584]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:23.624 --> 01:06:25.704]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:06:25.724 --> 01:06:26.084]  U.S.
[01:06:26.145 --> 01:06:27.785]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:06:27.805 --> 01:06:28.125]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:06:28.145 --> 01:06:29.005]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:06:29.025 --> 01:06:29.706]  Ask for George.
[01:06:49.928 --> 01:06:55.470]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:17.054 --> 01:07:22.395]  American fighter planes came in under the smoke to see if anything was moving.
[01:07:23.035 --> 01:07:25.315]  They saw Billy and the rest moving down there.
[01:07:25.515 --> 01:07:29.696]  The planes sprayed them with machine gun fire, but the bullets missed.
[01:07:31.596 --> 01:07:36.677]  Then they saw some of the other people moving down by the riverside, and they shot at them.
[01:07:37.177 --> 01:07:38.098]  They hit some of them.
[01:07:38.598 --> 01:07:39.418]  So it goes.
[01:07:40.138 --> 01:07:42.378]  The idea was to hasten the end of the war.
[01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:46.139]  That's from Slaughterhouse Five, which
[01:07:47.739 --> 01:07:59.949]  Uh, is his actual account of being a prisoner of war, being shot at and bombed in Dresden by his, day and night, by his own country, which he never blamed the nation for doing.
[01:07:59.969 --> 01:08:00.950]  It's just an interesting story.
[01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:09.477]  He got captured during the frozen Battle of the Bulge while the drunken Zeb Dietrich commanded the German forces.
[01:08:11.479 --> 01:08:16.703]  But, uh, at the bottom of the hour I'm going to talk about, uh, Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:08:17.506 --> 01:08:18.227]  Dead at 84.
[01:08:18.927 --> 01:08:20.389]  Right now, let's keep going to your calls.
[01:08:20.489 --> 01:08:22.371]  Chris, in Michigan.
[01:08:22.411 --> 01:08:23.011]  You're on the air.
[01:08:23.051 --> 01:08:23.392]  Welcome.
[01:08:24.012 --> 01:08:24.873]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:25.354]  Good.
[01:08:26.515 --> 01:08:27.956]  I've been listening to you.
[01:08:28.557 --> 01:08:33.381]  I really woke up in around 2005 when I saw the Road to Tyranny.
[01:08:33.461 --> 01:08:38.926]  I had read Tex Marr's book about six years before that, about the Illuminati.
[01:08:40.248 --> 01:08:42.189]  And I've just been
[01:08:43.092 --> 01:08:52.256]  I'm right now kind of bummed out because my computer's down and I don't have a DVD burner to burn any CDs, but I'm trying to get that fixed right now.
[01:08:56.017 --> 01:08:56.758]  What's on your mind?
[01:08:59.158 --> 01:09:12.684]  No, I just wanted to call in and I guess I just should warn all the listeners not to get that microchip, you know, because that's something that just probably won't be forgiven, you know?
[01:09:14.591 --> 01:09:15.111]  Are you kidding?
[01:09:15.131 --> 01:09:19.053]  When it gets to that, most of the churches will say it's the mark of the Lord.
[01:09:19.993 --> 01:09:20.533]  You watch.
[01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:23.134]  I mean, that's how devilish these churches already are right now.
[01:09:23.975 --> 01:09:24.315]  Yeah.
[01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:30.837]  Well, they're mostly controlled by beast prophets now anyway, so... I know.
[01:09:30.897 --> 01:09:34.999]  I mean, sometimes I watch TV preachers and I can't believe the stuff coming out of their mouths.
[01:09:35.879 --> 01:09:37.240]  And they just look like demons.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.081]  I mean, just the way they act is like a bunch of freaks.
[01:09:41.488 --> 01:09:45.070]  Yeah, I sent him $7.95 for a prayer rag.
[01:09:46.811 --> 01:09:47.652]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:09:48.272 --> 01:09:49.093]  See that one?
[01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:51.174]  I'm familiar with that type of stuff.
[01:09:51.194 --> 01:09:53.155]  Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?
[01:09:53.175 --> 01:10:00.000]  No, I just wanted to say keep up the good work and hopefully I'll be able to get these DVDs out soon.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.701]  Good job my friend.
[01:10:01.721 --> 01:10:03.822]  You keep it up and get that computer back up and going.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:09.902]  Yeah, I mean, you the listeners out there making copies of the films, it just keeps having a huge effect.
[01:10:09.942 --> 01:10:10.622]  Do not stop.
[01:10:11.122 --> 01:10:11.682]  Intensify.
[01:10:11.702 --> 01:10:15.703]  That's two callers in a row that were woken up by 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[01:10:18.184 --> 01:10:33.609]  Two weeks after 9-11, I went in to the studio and I shot a two-hour discussion that I called 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.402]  And then for about three months, I sold that.
[01:10:39.123 --> 01:10:45.326]  By the way, you can see it on PrisonPlanet.tv, that original Road to Tyranny, and we called it the Emergency Release.
[01:10:46.627 --> 01:10:57.494]  And then I worked my hind end off, and in February, released 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, which is basically what you see today.
[01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:11.318]  And that film was one of the first, if not the first, well, I know 9-11 film to come out, but also the first to really go big on the internet, on the file-sharing networks, and on some of the sites that offered it.
[01:11:11.698 --> 01:11:13.579]  We have no way of gauging how many saw it.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.841]  But I know that Road to Tyranny was one of the things that woke up Jason Bermas.
[01:11:19.221 --> 01:11:27.485]  And again, that is just so exciting to know that the work I've done, and that you did by getting the word out on the film, you're just as much, you know,
[01:11:28.829 --> 01:11:29.649]  Here to get the credit.
[01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:33.690]  It's just all of us together having a huge effect.
[01:11:35.431 --> 01:11:38.311]  Now you may see the DVD of Red Journey today and go, what do you mean?
[01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:41.152]  I see articles in there from mid-2002.
[01:11:41.692 --> 01:11:44.433]  You say this came out in February.
[01:11:45.653 --> 01:11:46.874]  Well it did on VHS.
[01:11:46.914 --> 01:11:52.675]  Back then I just put stuff out on VHS still and then I did an updated version, did an extra
[01:11:54.508 --> 01:12:01.110]  You know, 30 minutes of extras, and put that on the DVD, which is over three hours long, of 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny.
[01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:11.152]  So the DVD came out in, I think, late 2002, and we do a whole thing on what was going to happen in Iraq, and how they'd break it into three parts, and how they didn't want to go into Iran.
[01:12:11.432 --> 01:12:12.233]  Yeah, you can go see the film, 2002.
[01:12:12.533 --> 01:12:21.655]  So the edition you get today, frankly on VHS I put out three editions, but never told anybody.
[01:12:23.055 --> 01:12:26.897]  Add a little more, add a little more, and then keep duplicating them and putting them out.
[01:12:28.037 --> 01:12:30.298]  But, yeah, there's three additions.
[01:12:30.598 --> 01:12:31.539]  No, four additions.
[01:12:31.559 --> 01:12:37.422]  There's the emergency release, and then there's three additions of the road to tyranny.
[01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:43.484]  Three additions of that, of, you know, the official one.
[01:12:43.724 --> 01:12:46.305]  And it hasn't been changed, though, since late 2002.
[01:12:48.234 --> 01:12:50.215]  And that's the edition we still offer today.
[01:12:50.275 --> 01:12:53.155]  Not really a plug for the film, but it is a classic.
[01:12:55.476 --> 01:12:59.437]  And boy, I did it with no compression, basically with a Mr. Microphone plugged into the computer.
[01:13:00.257 --> 01:13:05.678]  And just put the video and edited it together with my wife, who was my girlfriend.
[01:13:05.698 --> 01:13:06.899]  We were just about to get married.
[01:13:07.239 --> 01:13:10.580]  And my cousin, Buckley Hammond, who now lives in Chicago.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.060]  Never see the rascal anymore.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.901]  And I say rascal affectionately.
[01:13:17.618 --> 01:13:19.560]  I liked it back when most of the family lived in Austin.
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:20.841]  A lot of them have moved off and stuff.
[01:13:20.861 --> 01:13:21.641]  But hey, c'est la vie.
[01:13:21.661 --> 01:13:22.282]  That's what happens.
[01:13:23.322 --> 01:13:24.403]  I am digressing.
[01:13:26.625 --> 01:13:29.327]  Let's go ahead here and go back to the calls.
[01:13:29.807 --> 01:13:31.728]  Richard, where are you calling us from today?
[01:13:32.489 --> 01:13:33.610]  Meridian, Mississippi.
[01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:34.210]  Welcome.
[01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:37.152]  Well, it's great to talk to you again, Alex.
[01:13:38.693 --> 01:13:39.534]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:13:39.574 --> 01:13:40.174]  What's on your mind?
[01:13:40.655 --> 01:13:42.776]  Well, about our beef dying.
[01:13:43.337 --> 01:13:43.617]  Yes.
[01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:46.339]  I kind of find it very alarming.
[01:13:47.583 --> 01:13:50.705]  Well, I do too, but instead we've got to talk about Don Imus.
[01:13:51.686 --> 01:13:54.107]  We can't talk about, you know, how they're running U.N.
[01:13:54.167 --> 01:13:59.211]  extermination operations against blacks in Africa, or how they're giving him deadly inoculations.
[01:13:59.571 --> 01:14:04.374]  We've got to talk about Don Imus and all feel real good, and then set the precedent for massive censorship.
[01:14:04.634 --> 01:14:15.882]  Well, I'm going to plan to do something in his legacy by distributing posters I have made myself that says 9-11 inside that has on the top it says 9-11.
[01:14:16.741 --> 01:14:19.803]  Troop.org and on the bottom says Infowars.com.
[01:14:25.146 --> 01:14:25.406]  Sure.
[01:14:26.487 --> 01:14:28.728]  Well, I mean, listen, I'm trying to let the caller talk, so go ahead, sir.
[01:14:29.488 --> 01:14:29.769]  Enough.
[01:14:30.809 --> 01:14:39.094]  So, Alex, I have made several DVDs of your film I downloaded from the Internet.
[01:14:41.255 --> 01:14:41.535]  Good.
[01:14:42.956 --> 01:14:44.197]  Including Terror Storm,
[01:14:44.767 --> 01:14:47.448]  I'm able to download 4 DVDs with torrents.
[01:14:49.408 --> 01:14:51.269]  You should try those sometime, Alex.
[01:14:52.309 --> 01:14:54.270]  We promote them.
[01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:59.692]  That's how a lot of people got Road to Tyranny 5 years ago, was off of file sharing.
[01:15:00.352 --> 01:15:00.672]  Yeah.
[01:15:02.773 --> 01:15:13.316]  And just think, when my city, everyone in my city wakes up, they're going to say the whole
[01:15:13.951 --> 01:15:16.733]  He said he was saying 9-11 is an inside job!
[01:15:17.093 --> 01:15:17.653]  Yes sir!
[01:15:17.733 --> 01:15:18.234]  Alright!
[01:15:18.254 --> 01:15:19.735]  Thanks for the call my friend.
[01:15:21.196 --> 01:15:23.857]  Let's go ahead now and talk to D.W.
[01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:24.578]  in Texas.
[01:15:25.305 --> 01:15:26.626]  D.W., go ahead.
[01:15:27.046 --> 01:15:27.807]  Greetings, Alex.
[01:15:28.247 --> 01:15:28.467]  Hi.
[01:15:29.008 --> 01:15:31.750]  Listen, I'd like to make a forecast of what I think is going to happen.
[01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.771]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:15:32.931 --> 01:15:37.274]  I've been listening to you, and I've been listening to some other talk show hosts, and I've just put the pieces together.
[01:15:37.394 --> 01:15:44.419]  I think, now this is my personal opinion, I think we're going to see a terrorist event, most likely in this country, within a year and a half.
[01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:47.381]  I think it's going to be a whole lot sooner that's going to dwarf 9-11.
[01:15:47.441 --> 01:15:48.682]  They're going to have to.
[01:15:48.702 --> 01:15:53.906]  The New World Order has to pull a rabbit out of their hat, don't you think, in order to keep up the facade since
[01:15:54.466 --> 01:15:57.708]  Well, I agree with you and I think that what you said is really astute because
[01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:26.991]  If you notice, they give themselves away.
[01:16:27.331 --> 01:16:41.858]  If you watch Robert Pasture and others on Lou Dobbs defending the North American Union, or you read their CFR recommendations and what the government is saying, they're now saying the SPP and the NAU is about keeping us safe from terrorists.
[01:16:41.878 --> 01:16:44.939]  We have to get rid of the borders and have a continental security zone.
[01:16:45.379 --> 01:16:50.682]  And again, the former head of UN Peacekeeping, one week after 9-11, it was actually eight days after,
[01:16:51.534 --> 01:17:00.339]  On Nightline, I saw him say, we're going to have a continental security perimeter, there'll be UN troops in America to keep you safe, and they call for getting rid of Posse Comitatus, so yes.
[01:17:01.119 --> 01:17:13.025]  Yes, that is their plan, to carry out another attack, and then claim that North American Union is the solution for our safety, and then rush it through, and I've always said it's a catch-22.
[01:17:13.085 --> 01:17:18.107]  Either we lay down, and they carry out terror sooner, and they win for sure.
[01:17:18.127 --> 01:17:18.167]  Or,
[01:17:20.405 --> 01:17:34.548]  We expose 9-11 as an inside job, we really discredit the New World Order, we take the power of government-sponsored terror away from them, and then they will still do it out of desperation, probably, unless cooler heads prevail.
[01:17:34.948 --> 01:17:36.068]  So which path is better?
[01:17:36.108 --> 01:17:41.550]  Is it better to have it on our ground, on the high ground, or is it better to just let them have their way with us?
[01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:42.750]  Oh no, I agree.
[01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:48.111]  We need to expose them and confront them on all points as often as possible, even at the local level.
[01:17:48.659 --> 01:17:49.360]  Well, that's right.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:50.761]  Why don't you fill folks in on that?
[01:18:11.827 --> 01:18:19.211]  Okay, the House voted it down, I think, just by a huge margin, voted this toll road system down.
[01:18:19.231 --> 01:18:33.039]  Now, not only is that a smack in the face of Governor Perry, but, you know, the entire bunch behind it, I mean, I guess, probably, like you say, you can trace that all the way back to Juan Carlos, to Spain, all these huge international corporations that are behind all of this.
[01:18:33.339 --> 01:18:39.803]  You know, so, they're going to have to pull a rabbit out of their head, like I said earlier, in order to keep this facade up.
[01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:42.985]  And I think this is going to be the pivotal move.
[01:18:43.025 --> 01:18:43.285]  No, no, no.
[01:18:43.345 --> 01:18:44.686]  Listen, I totally agree with you.
[01:18:44.726 --> 01:18:46.568]  They did vote for a moratorium in the House.
[01:18:46.608 --> 01:18:48.769]  The problem is, last time I checked, it didn't pass the Senate.
[01:18:51.651 --> 01:19:02.899]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:19:02.919 --> 01:19:09.584]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:19:09.804 --> 01:19:11.085]  To below detectable levels.
[01:19:11.366 --> 01:19:15.309]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:19:15.529 --> 01:19:22.055]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:19:22.275 --> 01:19:27.781]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:19:28.021 --> 01:19:32.605]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[01:19:32.825 --> 01:19:34.928]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:19:34.988 --> 01:19:36.971]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[01:19:37.011 --> 01:19:37.592]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[01:19:37.612 --> 01:19:37.973]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:38.033 --> 01:19:39.615]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:40.617]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:49.693 --> 01:19:50.673]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:50.753 --> 01:19:55.535]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:55.695 --> 01:20:03.498]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:03.758 --> 01:20:09.140]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:16.322]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:16.622 --> 01:20:21.966]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:22.226 --> 01:20:26.929]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:34.874]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:35.214 --> 01:20:35.835]  We're good to go!
[01:20:49.594 --> 01:20:52.295]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[01:20:52.675 --> 01:20:55.675]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[01:20:55.955 --> 01:20:58.036]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[01:20:58.336 --> 01:21:02.697]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[01:21:02.977 --> 01:21:08.738]  SFR Green's Protector reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.
[01:21:09.058 --> 01:21:10.358]  So do something green.

[01:21:20.071 --> 01:21:22.553]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:21:23.033 --> 01:21:24.935]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:21:25.636 --> 01:21:28.838]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:21:29.479 --> 01:21:35.924]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:21:49.254 --> 01:21:55.009]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:22:04.718 --> 01:22:04.918]  We're good.

[01:23:17.245 --> 01:23:19.026]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:23:19.246 --> 01:23:27.570]  Then I'm going to gather Kurt Vonnegut's death and my tenuous contact with him and the nice gift he gave me and some comments about 9-11 Truth.
[01:23:28.591 --> 01:23:30.091]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:23:30.131 --> 01:23:31.892]  Let's talk to Michael in Kentucky.
[01:23:31.932 --> 01:23:32.573]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:23:32.593 --> 01:23:33.093]  You're on the air.
[01:23:34.634 --> 01:23:35.194]  Alex, hi.
[01:23:35.974 --> 01:23:37.195]  I'm glad I finally got in touch with you.
[01:23:39.068 --> 01:23:42.070]  I'm not real good at public speaking, so I ask you to bear with me.
[01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:43.251]  Oh, don't be nervous.
[01:23:43.491 --> 01:23:43.711]  Come on.
[01:23:43.731 --> 01:23:44.712]  It's just you and me talking.
[01:23:44.732 --> 01:23:45.132]  Go ahead.
[01:23:45.592 --> 01:23:45.933]  Okay.
[01:23:45.973 --> 01:23:49.255]  Well, sir, my name is Michael Johnson.
[01:23:49.695 --> 01:23:51.657]  I'm 38 years old, and I live in Kentucky.
[01:23:51.677 --> 01:24:03.606]  I was a locksmith for 20 years, and my father, who's 59 years old, or soon to be 59, is currently serving a nine-year sentence in Eastern Kentucky Correctional Center.
[01:24:04.266 --> 01:24:04.807]  His number is 197158.
[01:24:07.739 --> 01:24:08.980]  In West Liberty, Kentucky.
[01:24:10.561 --> 01:24:15.764]  My father, for the last 15 years, I've heard some of your listeners talk about how their eyes were opened.
[01:24:15.804 --> 01:24:17.945]  My father's eyes were opened about 15 years ago.
[01:24:19.786 --> 01:24:26.630]  We lived in Michigan for a little while, and he did some research around the different state constitutions, and he decided to move down to Kentucky.
[01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:28.411]  Yeah, bottom line, what happened to your dad?
[01:24:28.992 --> 01:24:32.454]  Well, he's been a peaceful protester for the last 15 years.
[01:24:34.847 --> 01:24:37.988]  He was jail-robed through the court system in a little town that he had moved to.
[01:24:38.428 --> 01:24:46.191]  He has a long history, well-documented history of peaceful protests around the courthouse squares and stuff like that.
[01:24:48.592 --> 01:24:53.694]  In the fall of 2005, he was carrying out a 22-day peaceful protest with 65 signs that he made up.
[01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:57.075]  17 of those signs pertained about the local prosecuting attorney.
[01:24:58.016 --> 01:25:01.717]  His whole protest was about local government officials or county officials who weren't
[01:25:02.296 --> 01:25:15.523]  I've heard from people, they've said that he was lucky he wasn't hung from the nearest tree, and it's a real small town.
[01:25:15.603 --> 01:25:16.784]  Yeah, they think it's real funny.
[01:25:17.264 --> 01:25:19.685]  Did you ever hear about Kelly Rushing in Lyon County?
[01:25:20.126 --> 01:25:26.049]  One of our listeners, Upstanding Family, he gave the state police a Ron Paul video, it also had Road to Tyranny on it.
[01:25:26.801 --> 01:25:43.748]  And they arrested him, it was in the newspaper, and the newspaper said that the judge and the prosecutor said, these videos are illegal, they're anti-government and anti-police, and I called the judge at his house and he said, yep, he's going to be in my courtroom, and they tried to put Kelly in jail for two counts of
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:55.528]  Terroristic threats, saying the video was a threat, congressman speaking, was evil, and it was in the newspaper, the jury found him not guilty, and the harassment just intensified.
[01:25:55.548 --> 01:25:58.290]  Now let me tell you something, Kentucky is bad news.
[01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:13.122]  From what I know, they, I mean, it's some kind of freak show in there, with all these good people that live there, but just crooks running government, a bunch of boss hogs, and they do it, I mean, they get that, listen, a lot of times they just walk right up to your house and gun you down right there.
[01:26:13.897 --> 01:26:18.901]  So, I mean, you talk about, you know, deliverance or something, this is what we're talking about.
[01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:29.068]  They charged my dad with four counts of first degree stalking, and three days before trial, they eliminate 80% of his evidence.
[01:26:29.088 --> 01:26:33.231]  You know what, I think it was Kentucky, or was it Virginia, two weeks ago, I'll Google it.
[01:26:33.691 --> 01:26:41.737]  Remember the people that put a camera on their house to stop speeders, and they kept talking to the cop at 20 miles over, and then they indicted them for stalking?
[01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:48.498]  Well, I heard something about that down in Tennessee, too, something about they were doing that to speeders and stuff on cameras and stuff like that.
[01:26:48.698 --> 01:26:49.579]  Well, no, no, no.
[01:26:49.599 --> 01:26:53.520]  I mean, if you tape a god from your own home, they charge you.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:27:04.082]  In fact, I see articles every week where they arrest people because people have cameras on their house and it shows the cops beating them up and then you bring that to prosecutors, they indict you for surveillance.
[01:27:05.162 --> 01:27:05.542]  Yeah.
[01:27:05.582 --> 01:27:08.063]  I mean, we're talking about criminals running the government.
[01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:10.151]  Yeah, well that's what's happened.
[01:27:10.211 --> 01:27:15.255]  And my dad is a good man, he's raised four good kids, and he's serving, he's 59, and he's serving eight or nine years.
[01:27:15.635 --> 01:27:16.356]  What's his name?
[01:27:16.876 --> 01:27:18.137]  His name is Winston Johnson.
[01:27:18.197 --> 01:27:22.000]  His prison number is 197158 in West Liberty, Kentucky.
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:26.203]  It's at EKCC, Eastern Kentucky Correctional Center.
[01:27:26.764 --> 01:27:30.086]  And he's been sentenced to nine years for no possibility of parole.
[01:27:30.466 --> 01:27:33.909]  Like I said, three days before trial, they completely gutted his evidence to show his intent.
[01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:35.190]  Stalking is an intent crime.
[01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.832]  My dad has a long history of peaceful protest.
[01:27:38.426 --> 01:27:40.028]  While he was down there, he had two death threats.
[01:27:40.428 --> 01:27:45.513]  He had one guy come up on the sidewalk, and this has all been testified to in court, but nobody did anything about it.
[01:27:46.114 --> 01:27:50.398]  He had one guy come up on the sidewalk with an 87 Chevy Camaro and hit my dad while my dad was holding his sign.
[01:27:50.988 --> 01:28:13.653]  Well, listen, I mean, number one, do you know how scummy, I mean, usually country folks are great, but when you got a bad town, I mean, guaranteed they were up in the courthouse, inbred, white trash, IQ's barely above retarded, we're guaranteed going, look at Billy run a car into a pool!
[01:28:14.294 --> 01:28:17.414]  I love Bush, oh God, I love the war!
[01:28:17.434 --> 01:28:20.235]  I mean, I guarantee you that that's what's going on.
[01:28:21.292 --> 01:28:36.365]  And, uh, it's... Look, let me get... I'm gonna get... Email Aaron at Infowars.com, and I'll give the information over to my producer, uh, and, uh, we will, uh, see about getting you on, okay?
[01:28:36.385 --> 01:28:37.206]  What was the email?
[01:28:37.826 --> 01:28:39.488]  It's Aaron at Infowars.com.
[01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:40.949]  We're on the march.
[01:28:41.429 --> 01:28:43.051]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:46.654]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.068 --> 01:28:56.190]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:58.191]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:28:58.452 --> 01:29:04.735]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:05.035 --> 01:29:11.158]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:11.399 --> 01:29:17.422]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:29:17.722 --> 01:29:24.125]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:29:24.265 --> 01:29:27.807]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:29:28.107 --> 01:29:31.809]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:29:32.009 --> 01:29:34.530]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:35.731]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:36.011 --> 01:29:37.032]  Eliminate the cause!
[01:29:37.192 --> 01:29:39.974]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:39.994 --> 01:29:40.434]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:40.454 --> 01:29:40.514]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:54.470]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[01:29:54.850 --> 01:30:02.173]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:30:02.613 --> 01:30:13.577]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:30:13.637 --> 01:30:14.037]  Central.
[01:30:14.437 --> 01:30:20.059]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:30:20.379 --> 01:30:26.280]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:31.522]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:30:31.902 --> 01:30:36.703]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:30:37.143 --> 01:30:38.424]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:30:38.504 --> 01:30:38.864]  Central.
[01:30:39.504 --> 01:30:47.772]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[01:30:49.673 --> 01:30:52.936]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:30:53.177 --> 01:30:57.501]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[01:30:57.701 --> 01:31:05.568]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:31:05.888 --> 01:31:08.709]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:31:08.989 --> 01:31:16.533]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:31:16.633 --> 01:31:22.215]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:31:22.455 --> 01:31:27.997]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:31:28.277 --> 01:31:31.597]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:31:31.838 --> 01:31:35.198]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:31:35.418 --> 01:31:40.460]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dervsheave superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:43.361]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:31:43.381 --> 01:31:43.581]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:52.777 --> 01:31:54.317]  We're good to go.
[01:32:40.151 --> 01:32:42.614]  This world is ruled by violence.
[01:32:42.714 --> 01:32:46.958]  If you don't rule the world, you better get that in your head.
[01:32:47.018 --> 01:32:53.044]  This world is ruled by violence, but I guess that's in a different way.
[01:32:53.164 --> 01:33:00.931]  From Broadway to DisneyWay, that's a lot of territory indeed.
[01:33:11.974 --> 01:33:13.235]  Thank you, Bob Diller.
[01:33:13.915 --> 01:33:16.877]  We are back live here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:17.397 --> 01:33:20.158]  I've been getting emails, you know, man, your voice has even gotten deeper.
[01:33:20.258 --> 01:33:22.660]  I am not here trying to talk deeply.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:28.083]  I am not here trying to... I have oak pollen allergies.
[01:33:28.223 --> 01:33:31.404]  Now, again, which don't make me feel that bad, which I don't... I love it.
[01:33:31.524 --> 01:33:32.045]  It's fine.
[01:33:32.225 --> 01:33:32.685]  It's great.
[01:33:33.625 --> 01:33:36.067]  Cedar, they call it cedar, it's really...
[01:33:38.164 --> 01:33:43.489]  Mountain something makes me feel horrible like I'm sick for a month when the stuff comes out twice a year.
[01:33:44.270 --> 01:34:03.827]  Oak right now is literally green stuff covering everything so my nose is stopped up my throat's all you know coated in it so that's why you'll hear me pause and hit the cough button that's why you'll hear me talk slowly or my brain isn't working as well and Lord knows what's going on I just know nobody I ever knew really had allergies
[01:34:04.568 --> 01:34:22.271]  And then everybody I know has got them, even people that have lived in Austin their whole lives, and they're getting worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and all the major studies, in fact I have news on that today, show that it's the GMO pollen.
[01:34:22.811 --> 01:34:31.093]  I mean you've got huge GMO cotton fields, canola, soybean, maize,
[01:34:32.953 --> 01:34:41.299]  All over these growth belts and what happens is that gets your allergies going and then it's an irritant and everything else just compiles on top of it.
[01:34:41.319 --> 01:34:43.501]  And we know that's what's doing it.
[01:34:43.921 --> 01:34:47.724]  So I mean I let her and Austin's really bad because there's so much growing around here.
[01:34:47.744 --> 01:34:54.188]  We've got another report today about all the serious health problems.
[01:34:54.368 --> 01:35:00.573]  It's in studies what GMO is doing with liver failure and all sorts of organ problems.
[01:35:01.013 --> 01:35:02.414]  So I want to go over that in the third hour.
[01:35:03.965 --> 01:35:17.775]  I wasn't going to have any guests on today, but I told my producer, my wife, she used to do that job, she's in today doing that, that I wanted to get Bill Doyle back on.
[01:35:17.795 --> 01:35:27.562]  I just told her this morning, and she'd already called all these people and couldn't get ahold of Bill Doyle, the head of the Biggest Victims Families group on 9-11, who of course said it's an inside job on the show a few months ago.
[01:35:33.701 --> 01:35:39.904]  Is part of this petition to NIST about the fake evidence and the lies they've put out about the collapse.
[01:35:39.964 --> 01:35:42.765]  He'll be joining us 20 for 20 minutes in the next hour.
[01:35:43.826 --> 01:35:53.890]  But I am going to have open phones after that and I will get into the GMO and I've got to play that little six or seven minute clip, two different clips of James Bamford talking about government sponsored terror.
[01:36:00.974 --> 01:36:01.334]  So that's
[01:36:02.998 --> 01:36:03.638]  That's coming up.
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:13.525]  Let me right now talk briefly about tyranny, then I'm going to get into Kurt Vonnegut briefly and his death yesterday.
[01:36:13.545 --> 01:36:21.930]  When you talk about these small towns, well you can get either big city corruption or small town corruption, and they're both bad.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:28.842]  And it's where, generationally generally, it can happen quicker than that, but the really bad stuff is generational.
[01:36:28.862 --> 01:36:40.046]  It just gets accepted that the police are corrupt, accepted that the mayor is always a mob boss, accepted that it's all about patronage and peerage and who knows who.
[01:36:40.906 --> 01:36:42.646]  That's not supposed to be the U.S.
[01:36:42.686 --> 01:36:43.047]  system.
[01:36:44.867 --> 01:36:53.190]  But I have experienced small towns, ladies and gentlemen, off and on, I guess if you stacked it all together, over a year I lived in the country.
[01:36:54.426 --> 01:37:01.669]  You know, every time I was getting a little too rowdy or whatever was going on, they'd send me down to, in between Dallas and Houston.
[01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:06.451]  I guess my family's really closer to my dad's family, closer to Buffalo there.
[01:37:06.471 --> 01:37:08.632]  I always say Fairfield, but that's 10 miles north.
[01:37:10.033 --> 01:37:15.015]  But the county seat, and the county over next to it is, I guess, Teague, Texas.
[01:37:15.535 --> 01:37:18.396]  And I had family from there, and that was actually the school closer.
[01:37:18.937 --> 01:37:20.877]  So for part of a semester, I went to school there.
[01:37:20.897 --> 01:37:22.038]  It was a big, nice school.
[01:37:23.407 --> 01:37:28.269]  It was like 2 or 3A, but it was a gigantic school, a nice school.
[01:37:29.869 --> 01:37:36.291]  And the people point blank just said, they'd walk up and go, Are you a Yankee?
[01:37:39.052 --> 01:37:52.477]  And then I went to a football bonfire and they, right in the middle of it, hauled a burning cross up in the middle of the bonfire.
[01:37:53.712 --> 01:37:54.212]  And that was it.
[01:38:25.239 --> 01:38:30.804]  And so I'm there, you know, I'm there looking for girlfriends, dates, stuff like that.
[01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:35.247]  And, you know, I've had black kids I've talked to in class.
[01:38:36.168 --> 01:38:38.550]  And so I'm kind of hanging around with them and they're like, I'm getting out of here.
[01:38:38.590 --> 01:38:38.971]  That's it.
[01:38:38.991 --> 01:38:39.631]  See, they're doing it.
[01:38:39.831 --> 01:38:40.752]  I can't believe this.
[01:38:40.772 --> 01:38:42.313]  And the blacks all suddenly leave.
[01:38:43.594 --> 01:38:49.619]  There wasn't that many in the school, but, you know, and it was all done in plain view, but hidden.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:52.462]  You see, oh, it was a group of students.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.506]  That we're going to do it.
[01:38:58.658 --> 01:39:17.548]  And I didn't even know what it was, you know, because there's like white kids there and there's black kids there, and I'm sitting there, and truckloads of stuff are coming in for the bonfire, and, you know, I'd been there the day before with some other kids throwing stuff on the bonfire, and then they put this cross laying down up at the top, and black kids are going, I don't like this because I guess they've lived around there, and I don't know what they're talking about.
[01:39:17.928 --> 01:39:25.652]  I didn't figure it out until they hauled it up with a rope when the thing was already burning, and there's this burning cross up on top, and the
[01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:32.023]  The principal of school walks out and gets this crazy look on his eye with it burning.
[01:39:32.343 --> 01:39:34.805]  I mean, that's how secret societies work, folks.
[01:39:35.205 --> 01:39:36.025]  They're everywhere.
[01:39:36.065 --> 01:39:36.705]  They're all around.
[01:39:36.726 --> 01:39:40.007]  And when I came home, my dad goes, yeah, I didn't think it'd be like that anymore.
[01:39:40.047 --> 01:39:49.212]  He said in the summer when my mother was teaching summer school, you know, she was a teacher and she taught for both school districts, both Teague and Fairfield.
[01:39:50.553 --> 01:39:51.353]  She was an English teacher.
[01:39:53.843 --> 01:39:58.665]  He would go while she was there for half a day and he'd go to the pool, you know, that was in Teague.
[01:39:58.685 --> 01:39:59.626]  Teague had the big pool.
[01:39:59.986 --> 01:40:02.887]  They lived out in the middle of nowhere, like 15 miles from there.
[01:40:03.668 --> 01:40:08.790]  And, uh, you know, he'd go to the Five and Dime and get a root beer shake or whatever, root beer float.
[01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:13.932]  That's how he, and he said he'd be at the pool and have a walk up and go, are you a Yankee?
[01:40:13.952 --> 01:40:16.874]  And it's just those types and they'll let you know.
[01:40:17.094 --> 01:40:19.555]  We run things around here.
[01:40:20.603 --> 01:40:23.965]  And of course, most people in the town are just working jobs and living and ignoring it.
[01:40:24.425 --> 01:40:29.007]  But it's like that with the cops, and they all look like they got either too many or too few chromosomes.
[01:40:29.347 --> 01:40:30.608]  They all stumble around.
[01:40:30.628 --> 01:40:43.333]  It's all about, I'm the police chief, and I'm the sheriff, and I'm the principal, and it's all like that, and we run things around here.
[01:40:43.353 --> 01:40:48.876]  And man, let me tell you, in places in Texas, and Alabama, and Kentucky, but Kentucky seems to be the worst.
[01:40:49.742 --> 01:40:51.563]  I mean, you do anything.
[01:40:52.683 --> 01:40:54.623]  I mean, they're trying to take your house, and that's what they do.
[01:40:54.643 --> 01:41:06.587]  They take people's houses, and they take land, and they arrest people, and they harass, you know, drifters that come through, and they feed on people, and they harass the blacks and Mexicans, and then what do you expect?
[01:41:06.607 --> 01:41:10.508]  When the Mexicans take over town, they start acting like that to the whites and the blacks.
[01:41:11.068 --> 01:41:15.129]  It's just animal-level base garbage.
[01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:20.310]  Animal level base garbage.
[01:41:21.091 --> 01:41:27.274]  And so I hear about some guy who's out protesting about corrupt local... I mean, remember the guy in Tennessee a few years ago?
[01:41:27.294 --> 01:41:29.075]  I mean, there's been lots of these cases, but we got them on.
[01:41:30.573 --> 01:41:31.273]  I want them back on.
[01:41:31.293 --> 01:41:42.416]  We ought to do a whole show with people arrested for dropping bubble gum, or arrested for writing OK on a desk, or arrested for drawing a picture of their Marine Corps Captain Dad in art class and being arrested.
[01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:47.697]  Or the guy in Tennessee who owned one of the biggest companies in town, by the way.
[01:41:47.717 --> 01:41:49.438]  We know that for big guys, too.
[01:41:49.458 --> 01:41:51.738]  Owned the biggest construction company in town.
[01:41:53.078 --> 01:41:54.939]  He had an ex-wife who was on drugs.
[01:41:54.959 --> 01:41:55.879]  That had been in the newspaper.
[01:41:57.219 --> 01:41:58.520]  She got in custody of the kids.
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:41:59.160]  He didn't like it.
[01:41:59.873 --> 01:42:02.837]  So he stuck a sign in his yard saying, our judicial system's a joke.
[01:42:04.859 --> 01:42:08.163]  Now he lived outside the county where the court case happened.
[01:42:08.924 --> 01:42:13.289]  They sent police out to arrest him at his house and they said, the judge says you're not allowed to do that.
[01:42:13.729 --> 01:42:16.993]  And the judge thought that people were living in such a police state.
[01:42:18.288 --> 01:42:19.649]  They thought this was normal.
[01:42:19.689 --> 01:42:26.111]  The judge gave an interview to the paper and said, you're not allowed to criticize the judicial system and show disrespect.
[01:42:26.431 --> 01:42:27.252]  That was in the paper.
[01:42:27.552 --> 01:42:31.173]  Now, he later got a judicial review and got sanctioned, and last time I heard, lost the bench.
[01:42:31.733 --> 01:42:34.094]  But the point is, they think it's normal.
[01:42:34.695 --> 01:42:38.096]  They think in America, we're supposed to sit here and take it.
[01:42:38.796 --> 01:42:42.218]  They think we're supposed to sit here and lay down and take their bull.
[01:42:43.818 --> 01:42:45.759]  And I, for one, am not going to do it.
[01:42:47.455 --> 01:42:49.757]  I don't like being bullied, and I don't like being pushed around.
[01:42:50.858 --> 01:42:54.621]  And again, a lot of small towns are great people, nice people, it depends.
[01:42:55.241 --> 01:43:03.708]  What happened also, as you know if you've studied migration of human populations into more urbanized settings in the last hundred years, that we were 90% rural and only 10% in the city.
[01:43:03.728 --> 01:43:10.013]  But that has flipped to 80% in the city and 20% outside.
[01:43:16.218 --> 01:43:21.643]  You know, generally the brightest son, a lot of the families that have a lot of money, he got the college money.
[01:43:22.484 --> 01:43:27.849]  Or the brightest daughter went into town, or they wanted to go to the big city and seek their fortune.
[01:43:28.309 --> 01:43:29.010]  You can't blame them.
[01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:31.793]  So also that's why it's so bad in many rural areas.
[01:43:31.833 --> 01:43:32.673]  Now you see the reverse.
[01:43:32.954 --> 01:43:41.882]  You see a flight of people to the country of higher incomes and higher education, and so you're seeing kind of a reversal of that.
[01:43:44.159 --> 01:43:50.843]  But I mean, it's creepy, folks, to have literal power-tripping, you know, pervert-type cops ruling over you.
[01:43:50.943 --> 01:44:01.649]  And by pervert-type, you know what I mean, just real seedy and gross and on little power trips and in these weird little, sick little microcosms, these little bitty fishbowls they're in.
[01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:07.893]  But you know, everything in my life has taught me there's things behind the scenes you don't know about.
[01:44:07.933 --> 01:44:13.676]  I mean, growing up in Rockwell, Texas, smallest county in Texas, most wealthy county in Texas, I mean,
[01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:17.571]  Occultism was the norm, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:17.791 --> 01:44:20.072]  Everyone was into it.
[01:44:20.192 --> 01:44:23.433]  And the wealthy people, the billionaires, and there were billionaires that lived.
[01:44:23.973 --> 01:44:30.796]  And a few times, like I said, I had a girlfriend whose parents are well known to this day, multi-billionaires.
[01:44:31.156 --> 01:44:33.697]  And I mean, devil worshippers, man, right out in the open.
[01:44:33.737 --> 01:44:34.517]  I was like, what?
[01:44:35.837 --> 01:44:37.838]  Honey, you're good looking, but you're not that good looking.
[01:44:39.728 --> 01:44:41.829]  I mean the real deal.
[01:44:42.329 --> 01:44:45.370]  And then I get in all kinds of trouble in fights and car wrecks.
[01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:46.530]  You know, I was pretty wild, folks.
[01:44:46.930 --> 01:44:48.471]  And I wasn't bad, I was just wild.
[01:44:48.771 --> 01:44:54.473]  I get sent to the farm and I'm down there going to Teague High School and they're burning crosses, man!
[01:44:56.478 --> 01:45:01.600]  You know, that's the kind of... And the sheriff in the town I grew up in, in Rockwall, we all knew he was the drug dealer.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.461]  So we'd ask cops pulling us over, look, man, we don't use drugs.
[01:45:05.501 --> 01:45:09.022]  I mean, even back in high school, I just drank and I smoked pot occasionally.
[01:45:09.062 --> 01:45:09.642]  I didn't like it.
[01:45:10.383 --> 01:45:13.484]  And the cops would pull you over and they'd say, we know you're stealing stereo equipment.
[01:45:14.024 --> 01:45:15.584]  Admit it now or I'm taking you to jail.
[01:45:15.644 --> 01:45:17.285]  I'm like, I haven't stolen nothing.
[01:45:18.305 --> 01:45:23.047]  I wanted to tell them I did take some beer a couple times out of the backs of golf cart coolers, though, when I was 13.
[01:45:25.007 --> 01:45:28.268]  But uh, but I got a bootlegger I can get it from now, cop!
[01:45:28.948 --> 01:45:29.969]  And I didn't say that.
[01:45:30.529 --> 01:45:34.810]  Or I can drive it off Dauphin Road in downtown Dallas to the black liquor stores and they'll sell two of your ten!
[01:45:35.710 --> 01:45:36.571]  But I didn't say that.
[01:45:37.111 --> 01:45:39.572]  You know, we know you got drugs in here, we want to search it.
[01:45:40.192 --> 01:45:44.333]  And even back then, when that young, I knew to go, I'm not doing anything, no you can't search my car.
[01:45:45.293 --> 01:45:48.735]  You know, I mean that's why I didn't like the police state too, because I knew they were drug dealers.
[01:45:49.435 --> 01:45:53.136]  And then they're pulling me over, asking me about drugs?
[01:45:55.769 --> 01:46:07.976]  I mean, you know, everything in my life, I guess, was getting me ready to see what the New World Order was and understand the New World Order.
[01:46:07.996 --> 01:46:09.277]  I'm experienced so much more.
[01:46:09.297 --> 01:46:10.518]  I'm only 33 years old.
[01:46:11.558 --> 01:46:15.701]  Sometimes I wonder, if I lived to be like 80 years old, boy, I'm going to tell you, I would have done some living.
[01:46:15.741 --> 01:46:20.084]  I can't imagine the adventures and the bizarreness and the things I'm going to witness then.
[01:46:22.125 --> 01:46:24.066]  Alright, I said I'd get into Kurt Vonnegut and I'm going to do that.
[01:46:27.936 --> 01:46:32.919]  I learned he died last night, but if I say this tomorrow, it won't have the effect it will have today.
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:39.844]  I'm in contact with some of his business associates, personal friends of his.
[01:46:39.924 --> 01:46:43.807]  I know somebody who is good friends with Kurt, that's how I got in contact with him, in New York.
[01:46:44.888 --> 01:46:49.891]  I know someone else who basically manages the affairs of Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:46:51.744 --> 01:46:54.146]  I don't want to get into private stuff.
[01:46:54.166 --> 01:47:02.792]  The point is I get a letter, and then I get in contact with some people, and basically they're like, well, you know, he thinks that his life's kind of at its end, and I did see
[01:47:13.712 --> 01:47:16.233]  Like, he'd just given his last university presentation.
[01:47:16.253 --> 01:47:18.374]  I think it was up in Ohio at a university.
[01:47:18.894 --> 01:47:21.455]  He said, this will be the last time you ever hear me speak, you know, in public.
[01:47:21.495 --> 01:47:21.995]  Goodbye.
[01:47:22.815 --> 01:47:28.057]  And then I was told by his, uh, through his associates, you know, Kurt likes your work.
[01:47:28.097 --> 01:47:29.077]  He's seen some of your films.
[01:47:30.198 --> 01:47:32.298]  Uh, here's his address, you know, send some more.
[01:47:33.299 --> 01:47:42.522]  And then I got a, uh, he, you know, one of his handmade lithographs of the famous birdcage open.
[01:47:43.547 --> 01:47:47.168]  You know, with a For Alex, you know, written on it.
[01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:48.669]  You know, For You Alex.
[01:47:49.029 --> 01:47:53.311]  Well, it's now up on JonesReport.com and, you know, hand signed, Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:47:53.331 --> 01:48:00.514]  And then I got back in touch with him and it was just basically, you know, he thought it was near the end of his life and he's dead now.
[01:48:01.494 --> 01:48:07.256]  An 84 years old chain smoker, World War II vet, that he didn't want all the controversy, I guess, there at the end of his life.
[01:48:08.637 --> 01:48:10.918]  I cannot say to you that
[01:48:12.851 --> 01:48:17.394]  I know this, he was investigating 9-11 truth and he did not believe the official story.
[01:48:18.354 --> 01:48:35.824]  So, Kurt Vonnegut was a 9-11 skeptic and it's just too bad that he gave that speech and said George Bush was syphilis to the country, which means the country will go insane, is insane, and he said that we're going into dictatorship and martial law.
[01:48:35.864 --> 01:48:37.405]  We ought to go pull that last speech he gave.
[01:48:39.216 --> 01:48:46.558]  And so, it's hard to respect somebody and then not let what they really thought be known.
[01:48:46.598 --> 01:48:55.041]  But I'm just going to say, the bare minimum, because I do respect him, it's hard to, you know, it was never told to me that it was even his wishes.
[01:48:55.241 --> 01:49:01.823]  People contact me with stuff and it's just basically like, well, yeah, you know, I can't even say it without people knowing.
[01:49:01.863 --> 01:49:07.045]  The point is, Kurt Vonnegut was a real gentleman.
[01:49:09.944 --> 01:49:20.328]  And, you know, I frankly found that really high-powered people who are nice, who haven't become corrupt or evil, are so much more gracious and gentlemanly than just the common person in the street.
[01:49:20.768 --> 01:49:24.510]  Like, I can do something for some common person in my life, and they want more and more and more, and they don't appreciate it.
[01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:38.335]  And then somebody like Kurt Vonnegut, uh, well, I'm not going to tell you, because it's private, but I'm just going to tell you that Kurt Vonnegut was a real gentleman, and Kurt Vonnegut did have a lot of courage.
[01:49:39.242 --> 01:49:47.829]  And, uh, he's gone, but I wanted to just say some nice things about him and say that he was a 9-11 skeptic and was looking into 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:49:47.849 --> 01:49:58.558]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:58.938 --> 01:50:06.504]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:07.259 --> 01:50:14.321]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:14.702 --> 01:50:26.145]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:26.445 --> 01:50:29.947]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:30.407 --> 01:50:32.327]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:32.668 --> 01:50:36.509]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:49.838 --> 01:50:52.859]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.082]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:50:58.342 --> 01:51:02.704]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:03.004 --> 01:51:11.908]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:12.108 --> 01:51:15.730]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:21.054]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:21.354 --> 01:51:28.099]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:28.579 --> 01:51:29.100]  What about you?
[01:51:29.864 --> 01:51:35.226]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:51:49.904 --> 01:51:51.626]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:51.846 --> 01:51:55.550]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:55.870 --> 01:52:04.819]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:04.959 --> 01:52:09.884]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:10.084 --> 01:52:10.364]  Every time
[01:52:10.404 --> 01:52:10.604]  I think so.
[01:52:27.157 --> 01:52:27.778]  We're good to go!
[01:52:58.384 --> 01:53:02.546]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[01:53:04.367 --> 01:53:10.669]  George Strait was saying, seashores of old Mexico.
[01:53:11.329 --> 01:53:16.291]  It sounded so good, I got an idea.
[01:53:16.391 --> 01:53:20.333]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[01:53:20.593 --> 01:53:25.015]  The Lonestar State should be renamed Texaco.
[01:53:25.115 --> 01:53:25.935]  Welcome back!
[01:53:29.031 --> 01:53:30.693]  I'm glad that you joined us.
[01:53:33.175 --> 01:53:37.739]  There's been a new development on 9-11 Truth with Dana Carvey.
[01:53:39.201 --> 01:53:40.422]  And that's the great thing about a humorist.
[01:53:40.442 --> 01:53:42.424]  You can tell that he and Miller know the truth.
[01:53:42.524 --> 01:53:43.725]  Miller, a complete sellout.
[01:53:44.392 --> 01:53:48.275]  And Carvey's pretty much putting it out there, saying, what if Rosie's right?
[01:53:48.295 --> 01:53:50.697]  We're going to get a story up on this on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:53:51.338 --> 01:53:54.600]  Well, on JonesReport.com, he's going to be posting the video here in the next few minutes.
[01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:59.684]  We'll be playing it in the next hour, so stay with us on that.
[01:54:00.084 --> 01:54:01.686]  Don't forget, I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[01:54:01.766 --> 01:54:02.907]  I've made 15 films.
[01:54:03.047 --> 01:54:07.530]  All 15 are available on DVD at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:09.752]  My previous 7 were not available on DVD.
[01:54:09.812 --> 01:54:12.534]  They are now at discounted prices, many of them at 45% off.
[01:54:14.796 --> 01:54:18.278]  And get other films like American Freedom to Fascism at Infowars.com.
[01:54:20.339 --> 01:54:21.819]  The toll-free number to order is 888-253-3139.
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:34.885]  You know, I was just thinking about a letter I had concerning this whole Kurt Vonnegut thing, and I was like, about a year ago, I'd give him my house, and I'm like, here, hang this up on the wall.
[01:54:34.965 --> 01:54:38.207]  I framed his picture, and then, by the way, where's that letter?
[01:54:38.227 --> 01:54:39.367]  And we're like, I don't know.
[01:54:39.387 --> 01:54:40.648]  I mean, that's how busy I am.
[01:54:42.697 --> 01:55:10.779]  I just never thought I'd get these people are so nice Charlie Sheen gave me the Wolverine jacket that he that's on the cover of the war in the film it's on the cover of Red Dawn just oh this is in the mail one day with a now I've got that in a secure location but I was just it's just I mean I didn't get into this to have Kurt Vonnegut sending me letters and pictures he did hand-signed I didn't get into this to have Charlie Sheen giving me his Wolverine jacket
[01:55:12.526 --> 01:55:17.955]  I'm just honored to be here fighting the New World Order, and it's just humbling.
[01:55:20.379 --> 01:55:23.704]  I'm just an average person, and I'm telling you folks, we can win this fight.
[01:55:23.744 --> 01:55:26.549]  We've already captured the imagination and the hearts of minds.
[01:55:27.419 --> 01:55:28.700]  Of the majority of the people.
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:41.924]  I'm telling you, we're going to win this fight against the New World Order if you'll simply get TerrorStorm and make copies and keep making copies and put it on AXS TV and get the word out about PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and the websites and if you support us.
[01:55:43.105 --> 01:55:45.846]  And you know, I got a bunch of obnoxious advertising on all the sites.
[01:55:46.086 --> 01:55:47.966]  I mean, how am I supposed to pay the bills around here?
[01:55:48.847 --> 01:55:50.667]  A lot of it's good advertising, I shouldn't say that.
[01:55:50.727 --> 01:55:52.648]  People are like, why do you have a bunch of advertising on there?
[01:55:52.888 --> 01:55:54.149]  What am I supposed to do, you know?
[01:55:57.159 --> 01:56:00.040]  I say that because we just tried that.
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:07.262]  They have all those companies that place ads on your websites and then you have settings for it.
[01:56:07.782 --> 01:56:09.543]  And I said, put it on the conservative setting.
[01:56:09.563 --> 01:56:13.844]  I don't want a bunch of wild ads and mortgage ads and credit card ads.
[01:56:13.864 --> 01:56:18.686]  We could go in by computer and block all those out and then they'll pretty much just cancel the contract that we did.
[01:56:18.706 --> 01:56:19.766]  But c'est la vie.
[01:56:19.786 --> 01:56:21.467]  You just better buy my videos, folks.
[01:56:22.262 --> 01:56:24.743]  Because, you know, I hate to talk about money.
[01:56:24.803 --> 01:56:25.964]  I personally don't care about it.
[01:56:26.004 --> 01:56:31.507]  I don't even have time to spend a little bit of money I've got on pleasures because my pleasure is fighting the New World Order.
[01:56:31.667 --> 01:56:32.427]  I am obsessed.
[01:56:32.547 --> 01:56:39.771]  I am... That's why I hate wasting my time on the baloney of life and the baloney infighting and all of the stupidness.
[01:56:39.831 --> 01:56:41.512]  It just sends me into a rage now.
[01:56:41.532 --> 01:56:45.534]  You know, the things that are going on.
[01:56:45.554 --> 01:56:49.716]  It's like last night, you know, this local stuff going on here.
[01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:51.117]  I am just so sick of it.
[01:56:52.063 --> 01:57:16.657]  I actually was in a rage for like an hour last night and I've gotten to where I don't get in rages unless I'm on air and getting mad about something and I just I just I'm just so sick of it and then I cool off and then I'm just tired yet you know we're in crisis mode the bees are dying
[01:57:17.586 --> 01:57:19.267]  They're trying to start World War 3.
[01:57:19.347 --> 01:57:20.347]  The government carried out 9-11.
[01:57:20.948 --> 01:57:23.209]  There's GMO food that's toxic we're all eating.
[01:57:23.449 --> 01:57:24.909]  They're putting stuff in our vaccines.
[01:57:25.209 --> 01:57:26.910]  We've got to get serious, folks.
[01:57:30.252 --> 01:57:34.513]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:34.553 --> 01:57:34.854]  Big Brother.
[01:57:47.643 --> 01:57:48.684]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:49.404 --> 01:57:50.505]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:51.166 --> 01:57:51.986]  You want answers?
[01:57:52.747 --> 01:57:53.648]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.668 --> 01:57:58.251]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.491 --> 01:58:02.615]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:02.835 --> 01:58:08.639]  Now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:58:08.659 --> 01:58:09.920]  Then we've got a guest coming up.
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:14.423]  I'm gonna play this piece Dana Carey did of... with Dennis Miller.
[01:58:14.924 --> 01:58:15.785]  Is Rosie Wright?
[01:58:15.965 --> 01:58:16.065]  Is...
[01:58:17.174 --> 01:58:18.695]  Bush behind blowing up the towers.
[01:58:19.215 --> 01:58:22.017]  The answer is no, Bush is a puppet, but the people that control him did.
[01:58:22.577 --> 01:58:24.479]  Joe in Maryland and then Jim and others.
[01:58:24.519 --> 01:58:25.579]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Joe.
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:27.120]  Yes, Alex.
[01:58:27.661 --> 01:58:28.261]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:58:28.761 --> 01:58:30.342]  Yes, this is a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:58:30.442 --> 01:58:32.103]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[01:58:33.584 --> 01:58:45.812]  This is more of a, I don't know if you could classify it as a question or a statement about the World Trade Centers and the official line that we're supposed to believe that two aircraft flew into them and
[01:58:46.448 --> 01:58:49.050]  The heat from the jet fuel weakened the structure and made them fall.
[01:58:50.110 --> 01:58:51.111]  You're a student of history.
[01:58:51.571 --> 01:59:02.998]  You know that when we dropped the nuclear weapon on Hiroshima, that the only building that remained standing was the one that the bomb detonated directly over top of it.
[01:59:03.418 --> 01:59:07.761]  Here you have an unfathomable amount of heat and force.
[01:59:08.301 --> 01:59:10.562]  And as far as I know today, that building is still standing.
[01:59:11.403 --> 01:59:13.944]  And it's something that I hadn't heard anyone brought up.
[01:59:15.914 --> 01:59:21.199]  Um, here the building is 60 years later, um, still standing after a nuclear detonation right over top of it.
[01:59:21.299 --> 01:59:23.320]  Well, fill people in on that particular building.
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:24.301]  I vaguely remember it.
[01:59:24.902 --> 01:59:37.112]  Well, uh, uh, if memory serves me correctly, um, the Air Force used, it was actually, the target was supposed to be a bridge in Hiroshima, but of course, you know, not being, uh, uh, it was a free fall bomb.
[01:59:37.592 --> 01:59:42.997]  The bomb was dropped, I assume, using the bridge as the target and it must have drifted.
[01:59:43.581 --> 01:59:54.506]  The bomb detonated, I believe it was at an altitude of 1,800 feet above this building and the force, the building obviously is at its strongest point is from the top down.
[01:59:55.206 --> 02:00:11.854]  And for a building with, you know, who knows what the building standards were in Japan in 1930 or whenever the building was built, but it withstood a direct blast from the top of a nuclear weapon with unfathomable amounts of heat and force and the building is still standing.
[02:00:12.256 --> 02:00:22.741]  Yet you're expected to believe that an aircraft traveling at 400 knots flies into a building with who knows how much fuel left on it.
[02:00:23.442 --> 02:00:33.386]  The best that I could tell an aircraft when it takes off consumes about at least 25% of its full fuel capacity on takeoff and climb to altitude.
[02:00:33.847 --> 02:00:38.509]  And then the trip from that point back to the World Trade Centers
[02:00:39.347 --> 02:00:40.288]  Uh, how much fuel?
[02:00:40.308 --> 02:00:46.295]  You see that when the aircraft flies into the side of the building, you see a big puff of what's obviously fuel burning.
[02:00:46.316 --> 02:00:53.424]  That didn't burn inside the building, but yet we're supposed to believe that fuel and the impact of this aircraft brought down two buildings.
[02:00:55.117 --> 02:00:55.257]  Nope.
[02:00:56.737 --> 02:00:59.738]  And then you get into building 7, and then you get into hijackers training at U.S.
[02:00:59.798 --> 02:01:06.140]  military bases, then you get into CIA insider training, then you get into government drills of planes attacking the exact same buildings at the exact same time.
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:14.281]  Then you get into motive, then you get into the NORAD stand down, and the order two months before by Cheney to not let generals shoot down planes, changing the default position.
[02:01:14.802 --> 02:01:15.782]  And then you get into the U.S.
[02:01:15.822 --> 02:01:21.083]  troops' mass to invade Afghanistan in the months before with the launch orders on the desk of Bush two days before.
[02:01:21.716 --> 02:01:21.976]  No, I'm good.
[02:01:40.038 --> 02:01:49.242]  Even if it heated the buildings, it wouldn't aerosolize the concrete into giant pyroclastic ejections.
[02:01:49.802 --> 02:01:51.743]  Only massive explosives do that.
[02:01:51.803 --> 02:01:53.524]  It turned it into pulverized dust.
[02:01:53.984 --> 02:01:55.004]  Exactly.
[02:01:55.024 --> 02:02:07.370]  And even if it were possible, what are the odds of all, I believe there were 24 columns in each building, plus you had 4, I think you said 48 foot diameter columns in the center of the building.
[02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.610]  47, yeah.
[02:02:08.856 --> 02:02:15.502]  Even if that were possible, what are the odds of every one of them failing at the same time, which initially would have to happen?
[02:02:15.803 --> 02:02:18.004]  And not only to happen once, but to happen twice.
[02:02:19.246 --> 02:02:20.947]  Well, and then it happened on 7, too.
[02:02:21.007 --> 02:02:21.748]  It's all magical.
[02:02:21.768 --> 02:02:24.370]  In fact, we're going to be talking to an expert on this on the other side.
[02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:25.171]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:25.631 --> 02:02:27.373]  We will get to Jim and everybody else as well.
[02:02:28.554 --> 02:02:30.175]  Kurt Vonnegut, 84, he's dead.
[02:02:30.215 --> 02:02:32.998]  And Kurt Vonnegut was a 9-11 skeptic.
[02:02:33.038 --> 02:02:35.360]  He was definitely looking at inside job.
[02:02:45.154 --> 02:02:50.638]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:50.998 --> 02:02:58.623]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:59.321 --> 02:03:06.385]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:06.785 --> 02:03:18.211]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:18.511 --> 02:03:21.993]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:22.453 --> 02:03:24.434]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:24.734 --> 02:03:28.596]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:47.863 --> 02:03:52.025]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:52.445 --> 02:03:53.285]  So what do you do?
[02:03:53.585 --> 02:03:58.167]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:58.647 --> 02:04:00.769]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:02.151]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:04:02.551 --> 02:04:15.964]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:04:41.886 --> 02:04:46.147]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:04:46.407 --> 02:04:51.228]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:51.508 --> 02:04:52.869]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:53.009 --> 02:04:56.489]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?

[02:05:41.935 --> 02:05:46.977]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:47.337 --> 02:05:49.697]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:52.558 --> 02:05:54.879]  Well, Bill Doyle and
[02:05:56.673 --> 02:06:09.281]  Bob McElveen today filed a petition with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, seeking correction of inaccurate factual statements and analysis in NIST reports on the destruction of the Twin Towers.
[02:06:09.721 --> 02:06:13.323]  Mr. Doyle, who we've interviewed before, has said he believes it's an inside job.
[02:06:13.964 --> 02:06:20.528]  He's the representative of the largest group of 9-11 families in the Coalition of 9-11 Families, and lost his son Joey in the collapse of the Twin Towers.
[02:06:21.304 --> 02:06:27.527]  And Mr. McIlvain, an outspoken 9-11 truth activist, lost his son, Bobby, when the World Trade Centers were destroyed.
[02:06:28.248 --> 02:06:37.112]  Right now, I want to play, and it's only about a minute and a half long, we'll go right to our guest, Dana Carvey on that sellout, Dennis Miller, you know, the big fake liberal Dennis Miller.
[02:06:37.672 --> 02:06:38.833]  Never was a real liberal, folks.
[02:06:39.713 --> 02:06:46.476]  Making jokes about, you know, it was Bush behind the towers, and you've got to ask yourself, is Carvey being serious?
[02:06:46.857 --> 02:06:47.377]  He might be.
[02:06:48.659 --> 02:06:49.419]  Uh, but I don't know.
[02:06:49.439 --> 02:06:54.261]  The point is, is that this is exactly how things work, and this is what the facts do show.
[02:06:54.281 --> 02:06:55.821]  Uh, here is this piece.
[02:06:56.501 --> 02:07:00.823]  Like Rosie O'Donnell, and they just wanna, they wanna ape the notes.
[02:07:00.863 --> 02:07:03.603]  You know, young 13 year old boys, who do they look to?
[02:07:03.643 --> 02:07:06.324]  They look to, you know, Rosie.
[02:07:06.364 --> 02:07:11.646]  Well, my, my take on that, I don't know, I know you probably talked about it yesterday, but what if she's right?
[02:07:14.967 --> 02:07:16.427]  The bush blew up the building.
[02:07:17.335 --> 02:07:21.740]  Yeah, and that we incited the Iranians with Blair was the whole plan.
[02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:29.729]  And what if she's scared the hell out of this secret neocon conspiracy, this international cartel run by Cheney and Bush and his dad?
[02:07:30.190 --> 02:07:30.951]  Are they scared?
[02:07:30.991 --> 02:07:33.534]  Are they at night on the phone going, Daddy, she's getting close?
[02:07:34.115 --> 02:07:35.977]  I don't know what we're going to do.
[02:07:36.601 --> 02:07:38.842]  We gotta keep our heads calm, son.
[02:07:38.882 --> 02:07:43.463]  Remember when we had the trouble with Howie Mandel and he got close to our operation?
[02:07:43.583 --> 02:07:46.424]  Had to get to the game show to get him off the trail.
[02:07:46.724 --> 02:07:48.385]  But, Daddy, we can fool all the people.
[02:07:48.425 --> 02:07:49.905]  How come this comic on The View can see right through us?
[02:07:49.925 --> 02:07:50.325]  She's crafty.
[02:07:50.346 --> 02:07:50.606]  She's sneaky.
[02:07:50.626 --> 02:07:51.206]  Looks right through ya.
[02:07:51.226 --> 02:07:51.706]  Kind of a rotund oracle.
[02:07:51.726 --> 02:08:01.049]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[02:08:01.354 --> 02:08:02.775]  Daddy, what about Joey Bear?
[02:08:03.095 --> 02:08:04.076]  She's one of ours.
[02:08:06.918 --> 02:08:08.339]  Anyway, it goes on and on.
[02:08:08.359 --> 02:08:09.560]  I don't want to bore your listeners.
[02:08:11.161 --> 02:08:13.243]  Now, I'm not saying they're 9-11 truthers.
[02:08:13.343 --> 02:08:20.308]  Obviously, they're making a joke, but you can just hear it in their voice and that fake Dennis Miller laugh, and this is... I mean, these guys aren't stupid.
[02:08:20.328 --> 02:08:22.589]  They cannot know that they've been lied to about 9-11.
[02:08:22.649 --> 02:08:30.235]  I mean, they've got to know, but that clip's up on jonesreport.com, as well as a little lithograph hand sign that Kurt Vonnegut sent me last year.
[02:08:31.478 --> 02:08:34.900]  I think I mentioned it once, but since he died yesterday, I thought we'd put it up with a story.
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:38.862]  Paul Watson, it's also on PrisonPlanet.com, just put a story up about the Kurt Vonnegut thing.
[02:08:38.882 --> 02:08:39.723]  I hope you get it out to people.
[02:08:40.823 --> 02:08:42.804]  And yeah, he was questioning the official story.
[02:08:43.084 --> 02:08:52.409]  I'm not going to say he believed it was an inside job, but what I got was he was investigating, watching my films, and that he certainly thought that there was a lot of evidence towards that.
[02:08:53.190 --> 02:08:56.232]  Let's go ahead and go to Bob McElvain.
[02:08:57.292 --> 02:08:59.433]  Bob, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:09:00.054 --> 02:09:00.634]  You're welcome, Alex.
[02:09:01.431 --> 02:09:08.336]  Tell us about basically this petition that you guys have brought to NIST and who's involved and then tell us a little bit about your story if you can.
[02:09:09.316 --> 02:09:11.137]  Well I'll tell you my story real fast.
[02:09:11.177 --> 02:09:12.939]  My son Bobby of course died 9-11.
[02:09:13.059 --> 02:09:24.366]  He worked for Merrill Lynch and from the very beginning I sort of had questions but it took a real while for me to get to where I am.
[02:09:24.386 --> 02:09:25.927]  It's sort of an evolution.
[02:09:25.967 --> 02:09:27.588]  I did make all the commission hearings and
[02:09:28.288 --> 02:09:33.071]  Yeah, there was a time during the commission hearing that I just sort of gave up and I said, you know, this just stinks.
[02:09:33.851 --> 02:09:34.572]  It was a whitewash.
[02:09:34.652 --> 02:09:35.272]  It's a scam.
[02:09:36.212 --> 02:09:41.255]  And since that time, I just devote all my time to 9-11 before I was very involved in the peace community.
[02:09:41.275 --> 02:09:51.221]  And I sort of just thought of, you know, the blowback theory of Charlie Johnson about, you know, the foreign policy and making people understand what our foreign policy has done.
[02:09:51.241 --> 02:09:54.523]  And this is the blowback and why we had 9-11.
[02:09:54.563 --> 02:09:56.504]  But again, it evolved into
[02:09:57.230 --> 02:09:59.110]  I personally feel it was an inside job.
[02:10:02.451 --> 02:10:05.971]  In my travels, I've met so many people who are involved in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:10:05.992 --> 02:10:15.673]  Of course, I've met Steve Jones, and they had called me and asked me, and trust me, I don't know if you said it, but I am an expert on this, on the physics.
[02:10:15.713 --> 02:10:17.974]  Well, I mean, by expert, you lost family.
[02:10:18.014 --> 02:10:20.414]  You lost skin.
[02:10:20.494 --> 02:10:26.575]  As far as this petition, it's so important that I put myself out there as a family member.
[02:10:27.364 --> 02:10:50.396]  And to any listeners, to those jokesters that were just on the air, just any time they want to make a joke about this, just put them in my position, or as a father, or I mean, sorry, as a husband or a wife, and your relative or your son or your daughter has been murdered, and you supposedly have an investigation.
[02:10:51.236 --> 02:10:55.778]  Well, this is what the 9-11 Commission hearing was all about, and I'm not going to sit here and talk about that.
[02:10:55.818 --> 02:10:57.019]  I could talk about that for another
[02:10:57.483 --> 02:10:58.083]  Six hours.
[02:10:59.444 --> 02:11:01.365]  But, it was a whitewash.
[02:11:01.985 --> 02:11:04.146]  It was never meant to be an investigation.
[02:11:04.667 --> 02:11:09.829]  Benveniste actually said, this is not an investigation, it is merely an exposition.
[02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:11.470]  What is an exposition?
[02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:16.213]  You just lay things on the, you know, facts on the table, and then you make the decision what happened.
[02:11:16.353 --> 02:11:25.497]  Well, they said that we're not trying to assess blame here, we're just going to basically come up with recommendations of what to do, and that was in the Republic Total Police State.
[02:11:26.138 --> 02:11:26.438]  Correct.
[02:11:28.038 --> 02:11:40.925]  And just as far as this petition, it's a petition by, well, Steve Jones is involved, and a couple other people, and of course Bill Doyle, and it's a request for a correction of the information disseminated.
[02:11:40.985 --> 02:11:43.686]  Disseminated, of course, information they threw out.
[02:11:44.707 --> 02:11:47.208]  And the main crux, and now you're talking about 10,000 page report.
[02:11:51.767 --> 02:11:55.009]  NIST being the National Institute of Standards Technology.
[02:11:55.469 --> 02:12:02.672]  It was their job to investigate the reasons for the failure of the World Trade Center's 1, 2, and 7 falling down.
[02:12:03.472 --> 02:12:03.813]  Okay?
[02:12:04.253 --> 02:12:06.674]  Now, go back quickly to the Commission.
[02:12:06.934 --> 02:12:19.700]  Their only response to what happened that day, that the core, I heard you talking about the core a couple minutes ago, the core of the building was hollow, only filled with stairways and elevators.
[02:12:21.046 --> 02:12:23.467]  That's the only information we got from the Commission.
[02:12:24.187 --> 02:12:38.972]  Obviously, I think the whole crux of the story is how in the world could 47 steel columns in the corner of the building possibly fall from this attack?
[02:12:39.732 --> 02:12:44.894]  So the whole report, and this is very important, the National Institute of Standard Technology
[02:12:46.058 --> 02:12:46.338]  I don't
[02:13:04.514 --> 02:13:08.175]  It's not an objective report, and this is what this is all about.
[02:13:08.235 --> 02:13:14.216]  We are requesting that we get objective information disseminated to the public, period.
[02:13:14.756 --> 02:13:18.377]  Absolutely, and then they never even mentioned Building 7 in the report.
[02:13:18.477 --> 02:13:19.737]  Of course they didn't mention Building 7.
[02:13:19.797 --> 02:13:33.720]  So this report is basically one and two, just to show people, so they can get it out in layman's terms, that's their duty, to disseminate this information in an objective and unbiased
[02:13:34.153 --> 02:13:34.493]  Matter.
[02:13:35.034 --> 02:13:40.777]  The same kind of what the Commission was supposed to do and this NSIT is supposed to do.
[02:13:41.077 --> 02:13:42.478]  And certainly it's not unbiased.
[02:13:43.459 --> 02:13:51.424]  And so this is what it's a 28 page petition and explaining what hasn't been done in 28 pages.
[02:13:51.464 --> 02:13:54.906]  But it's very important it comes out in layman's terms so people understand it.
[02:13:55.507 --> 02:13:57.608]  No one's going to read a 10,000 page report.
[02:13:58.088 --> 02:14:18.793]  Now I want to go back, because there is architect Richard Gage, a member of the American Institute of Architects, and there's a scientist and former site manager of Environmental Health, Underwriting Laboratories, Kevin Ryan has signed on, and then of course there's Dr. Steven Jones, a physicist, and a lot of others.
[02:14:19.114 --> 02:14:20.614]  But before we get into that,
[02:14:21.625 --> 02:14:30.950]  First off, I'd like to specifically talk about your son and personalize this for people because I've talked to literally hundreds of victims, family members here on the show.
[02:14:31.370 --> 02:14:33.852]  I've listened to hundreds of other interviews on other shows.
[02:14:34.212 --> 02:14:38.754]  I've talked to the heads of the family groups like Bill Doyle saying more than half believe inside job.
[02:14:38.834 --> 02:14:39.835]  I believe inside job.
[02:14:40.235 --> 02:14:42.256]  He said the same thing you said about how it was a process.
[02:14:42.616 --> 02:14:49.100]  What is it like when you see Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and people like
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:15:03.292]  Glenn Beck say all the families believe that Bin Laden and all the families love George Bush and all the families want the war and use your name and your son's name for their police state and their wars.
[02:15:03.372 --> 02:15:04.232]  What is that like?
[02:15:04.473 --> 02:15:08.996]  When the truth is most people hate them, hate Giuliani, the firefighters hate him.
[02:15:09.056 --> 02:15:10.618]  I've been to Ground Zero many times.
[02:15:11.698 --> 02:15:12.819]  Well, how do I feel?
[02:15:12.859 --> 02:15:14.160]  It's like I'm shaking right now.
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:20.424]  I get extremely upset and that's why I really have to pace myself on this because I just can't let my emotions take control of what I'm doing.
[02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:42.447]  You know, it's almost like I gotta believe that I gotta keep playing in the sea.
[02:15:43.247 --> 02:15:45.329]  And the fact that I'm out here really helps me.
[02:15:45.849 --> 02:15:51.834]  I either have to turn the TV off, stop reading, and just walk away from it, or I have to be totally immersed in it.
[02:15:52.354 --> 02:15:53.595]  And, of course, I watch a rally.
[02:15:53.635 --> 02:15:54.636]  I've been on a rally show.
[02:15:54.676 --> 02:15:58.539]  I've been involved in Hannity and Columns, and it's very, very difficult.
[02:15:58.959 --> 02:16:03.223]  I have a bad temper, and I don't know what I would do if I met them individually.
[02:16:03.243 --> 02:16:06.425]  I've been, you know, like I would when I was on the Bill O'Reilly Show.
[02:16:06.445 --> 02:16:07.366]  I was down in Philadelphia.
[02:16:07.898 --> 02:16:08.539]  Because I said that.
[02:16:08.579 --> 02:16:13.863]  I said I cannot possibly be on the show in person because I'm afraid what would happen.
[02:16:14.924 --> 02:16:16.505]  And it gets me extremely upset.
[02:16:16.865 --> 02:16:19.187]  But I truly have to believe that.
[02:16:19.247 --> 02:16:24.071]  I've just got to stay out there and believe that planting seeds is the best thing I can possibly do.
[02:16:24.271 --> 02:16:25.612]  And stay totally active.
[02:16:25.913 --> 02:16:27.714]  And it's extremely difficult to do.
[02:16:27.754 --> 02:16:28.855]  I get very depressed.
[02:16:29.395 --> 02:16:31.537]  And the fact that they can make jokes of it.
[02:16:32.598 --> 02:16:34.800]  And again, anyone that's listening
[02:16:35.365 --> 02:16:45.236]  It's just, it's simple information, it's objective information, and one of the grandest pieces of propaganda that goes back to the turn of the century is, you call people's names.
[02:16:46.277 --> 02:16:49.340]  And this is very important, you call names, make a joke of it.
[02:16:50.081 --> 02:16:52.423]  Because this gets to the lowest level of people.
[02:16:53.064 --> 02:16:54.866]  And this is all part of propaganda.
[02:16:55.552 --> 02:17:03.416]  So, and I don't understand why they do that, but it's just that, you know, I don't know what book I read, but it's like they're desk murderers.
[02:17:03.836 --> 02:17:11.460]  Are you offended by what Dennis Miller and Dana Carvey were, you know, joking?
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:12.901]  I mean, you lost your son.
[02:17:12.961 --> 02:17:14.221]  I'm offended by everything.
[02:17:15.162 --> 02:17:21.505]  I truly, truly, I just wish I could get them in a room and just one-on-one and not on TV.
[02:17:21.545 --> 02:17:25.207]  You know, I just have to tell myself, hey, they're all in it for the money.
[02:17:25.734 --> 02:17:29.920]  And if they haven't investigated this, I truly believe they believe what they're saying.
[02:17:30.882 --> 02:17:31.823]  But they're not reading it.
[02:17:31.863 --> 02:17:34.006]  So it's just, you know, ignorance is blissful.
[02:17:34.267 --> 02:17:35.068]  Please stay with us.
[02:17:35.128 --> 02:17:35.749]  Please stay with us.
[02:17:35.769 --> 02:17:36.730]  I want to talk about the report.
[02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:37.151]  Please, sir.
[02:17:37.571 --> 02:17:38.953]  This is very painful for all of us.
[02:17:38.994 --> 02:17:40.095]  I know most of all for you.
[02:17:40.115 --> 02:17:41.097]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.125 --> 02:17:48.589]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:48.949 --> 02:17:53.033]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:53.333 --> 02:17:53.893]  We listened.
[02:17:54.193 --> 02:17:59.178]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:17:59.438 --> 02:17:59.938]  We listened.
[02:18:00.319 --> 02:18:03.361]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:03.781 --> 02:18:04.302]  We listened.
[02:18:04.762 --> 02:18:08.824]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:09.225 --> 02:18:09.705]  We listened.
[02:18:10.045 --> 02:18:15.288]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:15.688 --> 02:18:17.069]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:19.650]  Introducing the Murky Light, the gravity
[02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:20.530]  We're good to go.
[02:18:41.323 --> 02:18:41.763]  Gold.
[02:18:42.103 --> 02:18:43.384]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:43.644 --> 02:18:49.727]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:49.927 --> 02:18:53.748]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:54.088 --> 02:18:55.969]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:56.029 --> 02:18:58.330]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:58.470 --> 02:19:05.233]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[02:19:05.393 --> 02:19:06.474]  We're good to go.
[02:19:20.350 --> 02:19:20.550]  I think so.
[02:19:40.888 --> 02:19:47.990]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program, a million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[02:19:48.370 --> 02:19:50.151]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[02:19:50.391 --> 02:19:55.833]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[02:19:56.033 --> 02:20:02.014]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[02:20:02.214 --> 02:20:04.655]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.
[02:20:04.855 --> 02:20:07.176]  No matter what network marketing venture you're involved in,
[02:20:07.556 --> 02:20:07.936]  I think so.
[02:20:25.282 --> 02:20:27.303]  Weekly training calls, no additional charge.
[02:20:27.463 --> 02:20:29.744]  Plus so much more can't be mentioned in 60 seconds.
[02:20:29.964 --> 02:20:36.107]  Visit MLMincorporated.com to hear how you can become one of the elite income earners in the network marketing field.

[02:20:40.692 --> 02:20:43.294]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[02:20:43.454 --> 02:20:49.598]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[02:20:49.738 --> 02:20:58.885]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[02:20:59.105 --> 02:20:59.866]  It's called Slender FX.
[02:21:00.566 --> 02:21:09.798]  SlenderFX opens the door for a healthy metabolism, permanent weight loss, reduction of low thyroid symptoms, and considerably increased energy by helping to balance your leptin levels.
[02:21:10.118 --> 02:21:12.161]  Finally, a weight loss breakthrough you can trust.

[02:21:26.373 --> 02:21:26.674]  That's 800-972-8211.

[02:22:09.603 --> 02:22:20.506]  Bob McIlvain has got to leave us soon, but I want to get him up for a full hour in the near future to really tell his story and what happened to him and his family.
[02:22:21.407 --> 02:22:30.729]  So you're one of the victims, family members, a victim of all this yourself, though I can't imagine losing my son, that signed on to this.
[02:22:30.769 --> 02:22:38.952]  But I mean, again, describe what this petition to NIST says and why it's important and why people should go check it out for themselves.
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:40.921]  Well, it's very simple.
[02:22:41.861 --> 02:22:50.226]  The people who signed on, Stephen Jones, Ryan Gage, myself, Phil Doyle, we're called the requesters of the petition.
[02:22:50.246 --> 02:22:58.331]  We're requesting for correction of information disseminated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
[02:22:58.731 --> 02:22:59.391]  That's NIST.
[02:22:59.812 --> 02:23:04.655]  These are the people who wrote this paper on the WTC, the World Trade Center 1 and 2.
[02:23:05.055 --> 02:23:08.697]  And that's stuff like there were no 47 steel columns and the Easter Bunny did it?
[02:23:09.505 --> 02:23:10.085]  You're correct.
[02:23:10.846 --> 02:23:18.130]  And again, their job is just to disseminate information in an objective, utilitarian manner.
[02:23:18.491 --> 02:23:22.853]  In other words, it's intended to be used by the public to understand what happened.
[02:23:23.374 --> 02:23:28.597]  And quickly, one half page was devoted to why the towers fell.
[02:23:28.877 --> 02:23:32.399]  And this is why Steve Jones, physicist, engineers have gotten involved in it.
[02:23:33.019 --> 02:23:34.040]  They haven't explained.
[02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:37.542]  And you know, people call me a conspiracy theorist,
[02:23:39.389 --> 02:23:42.430]  And I'll say, well, no one's explained anything to me.
[02:23:43.050 --> 02:23:47.591]  And specifically, I'm just using the towers now, but I could go on and on and on about other subjects.
[02:23:48.552 --> 02:23:50.352]  I want to know why my son was murdered.
[02:23:51.052 --> 02:23:54.013]  And probably he died when the towers came down.
[02:23:54.593 --> 02:23:57.354]  And there's a good possibility he died from an explosion.
[02:23:57.694 --> 02:24:00.075]  Well, if it's from an explosion, then who murdered my son?
[02:24:00.675 --> 02:24:02.596]  It's obviously not the planes going in there.
[02:24:03.296 --> 02:24:06.737]  Because he was on the outside when it came down, when the planes hit, supposedly.
[02:24:07.682 --> 02:24:09.023]  So that's all I want.
[02:24:09.343 --> 02:24:13.286]  I want to know who murdered my son and how anybody can possibly question that.
[02:24:13.687 --> 02:24:22.934]  And then look at the commission and look at this misreport where they don't give you any answers at all.
[02:24:22.954 --> 02:24:27.177]  For those that have studied history and know military tactics, it's called sacrifice.
[02:24:27.277 --> 02:24:32.141]  I mean, generals will sacrifice back in the big wars, you know, 10,000 troops in a maneuver
[02:24:32.581 --> 02:24:33.762]  Just to suck in an enemy.
[02:24:33.782 --> 02:24:38.304]  They'll send in our troops to get caught in a gorge and then suck in the main force of the other enemy.
[02:24:38.984 --> 02:24:46.327]  But people can't imagine they'd kill 2,800 and something Americans, including your son, to get World War III kicked off and take global control.
[02:24:46.767 --> 02:24:48.828]  They've got another thing coming as this unravels.
[02:24:48.888 --> 02:24:50.649]  Or, A, do you agree it's unraveling?
[02:24:50.989 --> 02:24:53.991]  And then the 9-11 truth is accelerating and more and more family members are going public?
[02:24:54.011 --> 02:24:54.751]  I mean, that's what's happened.
[02:24:55.491 --> 02:24:58.392]  And then what will the establishment and those guilty do?
[02:24:58.732 --> 02:24:59.532]  What can they do?
[02:24:59.632 --> 02:25:03.993]  Because I don't think they expected for people to start waking up like you and others have done.
[02:25:05.353 --> 02:25:06.053]  Well, what would they do?
[02:25:06.113 --> 02:25:06.493]  I don't know.
[02:25:06.514 --> 02:25:09.914]  To me, it's like I spent a lot of time in Iran-Contra.
[02:25:09.934 --> 02:25:14.115]  And I know Iran-Contra and then going into the Clinton years, a lot of people just start disappearing.
[02:25:14.935 --> 02:25:16.656]  I think that's going to be their only alternative.
[02:25:16.756 --> 02:25:22.457]  Hopefully, I'm very pessimistic because I get so down and I really do get depressed about all this.
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:25.241]  And I can see it.
[02:25:25.261 --> 02:25:28.484]  You know, the truth movement is moving forward.
[02:25:29.164 --> 02:25:34.948]  But I just don't know, because people I talk to, they just don't want to believe that this can possibly happen.
[02:25:35.489 --> 02:25:36.570]  And I really do have hope.
[02:25:36.610 --> 02:25:42.994]  And it does help me to talk on shows and to keep getting involved with people and to do my reading.
[02:25:43.074 --> 02:25:44.335]  But I don't know.
[02:25:44.615 --> 02:25:45.536]  I think I'm a pessimist.
[02:25:45.556 --> 02:25:49.639]  I just don't have that much hope, you know, because I just think there's going to be another false flag.
[02:25:50.119 --> 02:25:51.160]  That's our only alternative.
[02:25:51.781 --> 02:25:53.762]  Let everybody forget about it again.
[02:25:54.482 --> 02:25:57.444]  Is it painful when they do carry out false flags like 7-7?
[02:25:58.144 --> 02:26:02.226]  I mean, to see the, obviously, the killers grandstanding as the saviors?
[02:26:02.246 --> 02:26:07.089]  I mean, this isn't like a normal murder, where they murder and they disappear into the night, you never know who they are or see them.
[02:26:07.469 --> 02:26:13.012]  With this, you've got to look at the killers on TV, traipsing around as heroes.
[02:26:13.032 --> 02:26:14.072]  Well, what is that like for you?
[02:26:14.573 --> 02:26:15.653]  Well, it's really bad.
[02:26:15.673 --> 02:26:19.135]  I think you have to be a real student of history to... it just doesn't overwhelm me.
[02:26:19.699 --> 02:26:30.546]  I mean, if you understand this century, I've talked in South America, I've been to Japan, I've talked around the world, and people around the world have been dying like this forever.
[02:26:31.907 --> 02:26:33.528]  I really don't want to be looked at as a victim.
[02:26:33.668 --> 02:26:37.991]  I'm just part of this, what you call, I guess, the New World Order.
[02:26:40.192 --> 02:26:41.733]  It's a Machiavellian philosophy.
[02:26:41.773 --> 02:26:47.497]  They really feel justified in doing anything they want, as long as it's good for what they say is the national good.
[02:26:48.095 --> 02:26:51.217]  It's like Lee Hamilton constantly is involved in covering up things.
[02:26:51.597 --> 02:26:53.659]  Well, it's because it's for national security.
[02:26:54.039 --> 02:26:55.760]  So that's where the justification is.
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:01.063]  So it doesn't matter how many people die, because it's for the national good.
[02:27:01.083 --> 02:27:02.705]  And that's what people have to understand.
[02:27:02.945 --> 02:27:10.470]  We as individual citizens, it's like you said, making the comparison to a military general saying, hey, we're going to sacrifice 10,000 people.
[02:27:10.730 --> 02:27:14.092]  My son was sacrificed for the good of what they think is
[02:27:15.293 --> 02:27:16.193]  Good for the nation.
[02:27:16.474 --> 02:27:17.094]  And that's sad.
[02:27:17.154 --> 02:27:17.754]  It really is sad.
[02:27:17.794 --> 02:27:19.435]  And it's extremely upsetting.
[02:27:19.535 --> 02:27:20.535]  Extremely upsetting.
[02:27:20.575 --> 02:27:22.116]  God bless you, Bob McIlvain.
[02:27:22.156 --> 02:27:23.297]  We'll have you up again soon.
[02:27:23.357 --> 02:27:24.677]  Thank you for the time, my friend.
[02:27:24.697 --> 02:27:27.979]  And we've got links to the petition and info on InfoWars.com.
[02:27:27.999 --> 02:27:28.319]  Thank you.
[02:27:28.339 --> 02:27:28.539]  All right.
[02:27:28.579 --> 02:27:29.379]  Thanks for your help, Mark.
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:31.020]  God bless.
[02:27:32.281 --> 02:27:33.241]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.681 --> 02:27:35.302]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:36.183 --> 02:27:38.884]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.679 --> 02:27:43.680]  How are you feeling today?

[02:28:53.849 --> 02:28:57.014]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[02:28:57.254 --> 02:29:00.940]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[02:29:01.220 --> 02:29:08.791]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[02:29:43.132 --> 02:29:47.694]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:29:48.094 --> 02:29:51.036]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:29:51.356 --> 02:29:53.917]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:29:54.277 --> 02:29:59.099]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:59.479 --> 02:30:04.862]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:30:05.162 --> 02:30:08.123]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:30:08.303 --> 02:30:08.884]  We're good to go.
[02:30:31.707 --> 02:30:37.172]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:30:37.192 --> 02:30:37.633]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:30:59.870 --> 02:31:04.932]  You just heard from a father whose son was murdered by these people.
[02:31:06.793 --> 02:31:25.440]  And yeah, I played that club full well knowing that it would be offensive to that father, but I wanted to point out that that's done every day on national television, on the radio, and he hears that every day.
[02:31:25.501 --> 02:31:26.461]  I talked to him beforehand.
[02:31:29.617 --> 02:31:30.457]  That's what they do.
[02:31:32.018 --> 02:31:33.759]  And they have to hear that, and it makes them mad.
[02:31:33.779 --> 02:31:35.340]  So we're illustrating that here on air.
[02:31:36.741 --> 02:31:38.221]  It's all real funny, huh?
[02:31:38.722 --> 02:31:45.525]  You laugh about 2,800 and something dead people killed by criminal elements of this government because you're a slack-jawed yuppie.
[02:31:46.105 --> 02:31:49.507]  But slack-jawed yuppies, do you think you're safe?
[02:31:50.428 --> 02:31:52.108]  Do you think you're part of the system?
[02:31:52.128 --> 02:31:54.410]  Do you think that stuff can't happen to you?
[02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:57.931]  A government that'll do that will do all sorts of other things.
[02:31:57.971 --> 02:31:59.112]  And let me give you the newsflash.
[02:32:00.277 --> 02:32:03.658]  They are doing all of those things to you.
[02:32:05.339 --> 02:32:08.620]  They're doing that to you every day and every way.
[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:16.582]  Alright, I know we've got a lot of phone lines here with Tim and Johnny and Pat and JD and Tom.
[02:32:17.763 --> 02:32:20.243]  We're going to get to you, but I've got some other news here.
[02:32:20.444 --> 02:32:25.285]  Some genetically modified plant news and what health effects it's causing and some other things.
[02:32:25.305 --> 02:32:28.026]  But what we'll do is I'm going to play this six or so minute clip
[02:32:28.835 --> 02:32:41.247]  Six minute long clip of James Bamford, big researcher, former news exec at ABC News, getting to Northwoods, but then he's got a book out about Iraq being a pre-planned stage deal.
[02:32:41.608 --> 02:32:50.056]  He talks about, so it's three different clips, three different, one of them's national TV and the other two are local, I think one's New York, one's Boston, television.
[02:32:52.210 --> 02:32:58.835]  It's just, we've interviewed him before, but this is kind of condensed and important to hear as well, because we keep hammering on 9-11 truth a lot lately.
[02:32:58.875 --> 02:33:01.596]  You know, I might go a month sometimes without really talking a lot about it.
[02:33:01.656 --> 02:33:02.117]  I should.
[02:33:02.537 --> 02:33:07.921]  Lately I've been on it a lot, because sometimes I might go a month solid on it, because it's so central.
[02:33:07.981 --> 02:33:11.823]  The war, the police state, everything is based now on that fraud.
[02:33:11.863 --> 02:33:12.584]  It must crumble.
[02:33:13.024 --> 02:33:14.285]  We must defeat that lie.
[02:33:15.487 --> 02:33:18.911]  Then we'll go to your calls after this and then hit some other news reports.
[02:33:19.491 --> 02:33:22.034]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:22.615 --> 02:33:26.438]  Oh, and whoever put this on the web, put some music over the start of it.
[02:33:26.799 --> 02:33:31.604]  We've cut most of the intro off, but it overlaps some of Bamford, so that fades out in a moment.
[02:33:31.644 --> 02:33:32.104]  Bear with us.
[02:33:32.124 --> 02:33:32.485]  Here it is.
[02:33:34.578 --> 02:33:40.120]  To show that there was an attack by Cuba on the United States.
[02:33:40.180 --> 02:33:43.142]  And the idea was to have U.S.
[02:33:43.182 --> 02:33:50.044]  personnel from the CIA and other places secretly create terrorism in the United States.
[02:33:50.064 --> 02:33:55.246]  The documents actually said people would be shot on American streets, bombs would be blown up.
[02:33:56.747 --> 02:34:01.429]  And again, all this, the evidence would be laid to point the finger at Castro.
[02:34:03.026 --> 02:34:17.080]  One other idea was they were going to they had a very complex plan where they were going to take an aircraft and load it with CIA people who look like college students, fly it over to have it take off from an airport in Miami with a lot of publicity.
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:23.482]  And then it would quickly, after it got into the air, land at a secret CIA base.
[02:34:24.002 --> 02:34:28.544]  At that same time, an identical plane would take off from that CIA base.
[02:34:28.944 --> 02:34:30.144]  So this plane would be empty.
[02:34:30.905 --> 02:34:33.846]  And it would be remotely piloted from the ground.
[02:34:33.866 --> 02:34:38.287]  It was a drone plane that would be very similar to the passenger plane that had just taken off.
[02:34:39.127 --> 02:34:43.809]  And once the plane was over Cuba, there was going to be a tape recorder that would have played
[02:34:44.896 --> 02:35:02.609]  Distress call into a microphone saying help or being shot at and a few minutes later once the plane was over the Caribbean Sea for Passover Cuba it would have somebody would have pressed the button on the ground blowing up the plane and they would have blamed Cuba for killing a plane load of American college students.
[02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:06.092]  These were all outrageous plans.
[02:35:06.152 --> 02:35:08.594]  They made their way all the way up to Secretary of Defense
[02:35:09.675 --> 02:35:10.236]  McNamara.
[02:35:10.536 --> 02:35:20.963]  Actually the plans were all signed by all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and then they went up to McNamara and McNamara rejected the plan and that was the end of it.
[02:35:21.123 --> 02:35:31.930]  So it never got put into effect but the fact that you can get all the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the senior military officials in the U.S.
[02:35:31.950 --> 02:35:37.414]  government signing off on a plan that outrageous is extraordinary to me.
[02:35:39.426 --> 02:35:43.129]  Good evening, you're watching the Digital Age, and I'm James Goodale.
[02:35:43.509 --> 02:35:55.377]  The Digital Age talks about terrorism, because terrorism is part of the Digital Age, and tonight, we are going to talk about terrorism, and we're going to talk about a book that talks about 9-11 and Iraq.
[02:35:56.178 --> 02:36:06.224]  This book, as you can see, is called A Pretext for War, 9-11, Iraq, and the Abuse of our Intelligence Agencies.
[02:36:07.585 --> 02:36:08.366]  It was written by
[02:36:09.329 --> 02:36:10.070]  James Bamford.
[02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.870]  Jim Bamford.
[02:36:11.911 --> 02:36:13.572]  And thank you for stopping by.
[02:36:14.173 --> 02:36:16.014]  Jim, it's great to see you again.
[02:36:16.034 --> 02:36:17.155]  My pleasure, Jim.
[02:36:17.195 --> 02:36:17.535]  Thank you.
[02:36:18.176 --> 02:36:19.076]  Now, your conclusion.
[02:36:19.116 --> 02:36:24.320]  I'm going to read your conclusion of this whole book and ask you some questions about it.
[02:36:24.380 --> 02:36:25.161]  Here's what you say.
[02:36:25.861 --> 02:36:34.808]  Thus, the Bush administration's massive disinformation campaign, abetted by a lazy and timid press,
[02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:43.095]  Succeeded spectacularly in driving the public to support its long-planned war.
[02:36:43.976 --> 02:36:53.343]  So, I want to ask you, generally speaking, we get to the end and you can respond more particularly if you wish, but we'll deal with it as we go along.
[02:36:53.803 --> 02:36:57.365]  Was there really a disinformation plan?
[02:36:58.046 --> 02:36:59.667]  Well, I guess you could say yes there is.
[02:37:00.107 --> 02:37:02.109]  Okay, so what was the disinformation plan?
[02:37:03.537 --> 02:37:09.622]  The administration had been wanting to go to war for years, even before they came together in January of 2001.
[02:37:09.902 --> 02:37:11.543]  They'd been wanting this war in Iraq.
[02:37:12.524 --> 02:37:16.347]  They'd done everything that they once, in 1996, the same group of people,
[02:37:17.249 --> 02:37:28.412]  There were the architects of the war in Iraq planned it for Israel and they sent it to Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Netanyahu, when he became Prime Minister and Netanyahu didn't go along with it.
[02:37:28.852 --> 02:37:31.573]  They tried to get... Stop, stop, stop.
[02:37:31.673 --> 02:37:33.873]  That's quite a mouthful that you just said there.
[02:37:34.253 --> 02:37:34.553]  Right.
[02:37:35.194 --> 02:37:45.016]  And I don't think I've read that anywhere else and if anyone were to read your book, they ought to read the book I would say in some part because of what you just said.
[02:37:46.189 --> 02:37:53.631]  Which was there was a plan on the books that had been given effectively to Israel and it was reactivated.
[02:37:53.771 --> 02:37:55.332]  And I want to explain more about that.
[02:37:55.372 --> 02:38:05.195]  But I also want to say that I tried to get someone else to come on the program to counter
[02:38:06.232 --> 02:38:10.279]  Your view on this, because I think this is a pretty unique statement.
[02:38:10.319 --> 02:38:15.006]  So, excuse the interruption, but explain a little bit more about, there already was a plan, 1990 what?
[02:38:17.515 --> 02:38:40.934]  The plan had been there from 1996 and was mothballed, and that's what you're saying, and was brought out, and... Yeah, in 1996, three people, there were more, but three key people who later became senior officials in the George W. Bush administration, Richard Perle, who became the chairman of the Defense Policy Board, Douglas Fyfe, who became
[02:38:41.854 --> 02:38:53.439]  The number three person in the Pentagon, the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, and David Wilmser, who ran a little intelligence unit in the Pentagon and then became Vice President Cheney's Middle East Advisor.
[02:38:54.119 --> 02:38:57.740]  They were working for Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel.
[02:38:57.980 --> 02:39:01.062]  They actually signed on as consultants to Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996.
[02:39:02.382 --> 02:39:04.704]  Which sounds extraordinary as it is, but they did.
[02:39:06.105 --> 02:39:13.871]  And one of the things they did was create a foreign policy forum with regard to what they should do in the Middle East.
[02:39:14.132 --> 02:39:24.720]  And one of their key suggestions was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and replace him with a leader who was friendly to both Israel and the United States.
[02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:30.245]  The person they had in mind was Ahmed Chalabi, who later became fairly famous in
[02:39:31.065 --> 02:39:32.066]  We're good to go.
[02:39:43.866 --> 02:39:49.070]  A think tank in Israel that they were doing this for on behalf of Benjamin Netanyahu.
[02:39:49.350 --> 02:39:51.972]  They were paid by a think tank in Israel?
[02:39:52.152 --> 02:39:54.794]  Yeah, it was a think tank.
[02:39:54.814 --> 02:39:57.416]  I can't remember the name of it right now, but it's on their website.
[02:39:58.537 --> 02:40:01.639]  Somebody does a Google search of a clean break and they'll find it.
[02:40:01.799 --> 02:40:03.861]  It's well known.
[02:40:03.901 --> 02:40:05.141]  Nobody's ever denied it.
[02:40:05.202 --> 02:40:05.682]  It's out there.
[02:40:06.937 --> 02:40:13.099]  Right after September 11th, Richard Perle's Defense Policy Board had this big meeting.
[02:40:13.119 --> 02:40:14.639]  Do you know who was at that meeting?
[02:40:15.859 --> 02:40:16.659]  Achmed Chalabi.
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:18.020]  And Henry Kissinger.
[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:21.961]  The whole board was there.
[02:40:22.301 --> 02:40:23.681]  Yeah, at least Henry Kissinger.
[02:40:24.121 --> 02:40:26.062]  There's a reason for him to be there.
[02:40:26.422 --> 02:40:27.782]  What was Chalabi doing at a meeting?
[02:40:31.261 --> 02:40:32.983]  When he's not even a member of the policy?
[02:40:33.003 --> 02:40:34.364]  Of course he's not.
[02:40:34.404 --> 02:40:35.245]  He's an Iraqi.
[02:40:36.706 --> 02:40:38.348]  Oh, I see.
[02:40:38.728 --> 02:40:49.919]  The whole idea was for years and years and years and years to overthrow Iraq, get rid of Saddam Hussein, put their friend Ahmed Chalabi in office.
[02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:54.463]  This is not an original idea on my part.
[02:40:55.879 --> 02:40:57.946]  This is well known by now.
[02:40:58.086 --> 02:41:01.237]  All the reviews about your book say it's a great book because you connect the dots.
[02:41:01.778 --> 02:41:04.119]  The entire top of the building just blew up.
[02:41:04.159 --> 02:41:05.119]  The second explosion.
[02:41:05.139 --> 02:41:06.139]  Second explosion.
[02:41:06.239 --> 02:41:07.320]  And another explosion.
[02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:08.500]  And another explosion.
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:12.721]  We have a report now of a fourth explosion at the Trade Center.
[02:41:13.121 --> 02:41:16.022]  There has just been a huge explosion.
[02:41:16.202 --> 02:41:18.003]  Huge explosion.
[02:41:18.363 --> 02:41:23.184]  It almost looks like one of those implosions of buildings that you see.
[02:41:23.204 --> 02:41:26.125]  We heard a very loud blast, an explosion.
[02:41:26.894 --> 02:41:30.736]  Not clear now is why this explosion took place.
[02:41:31.416 --> 02:41:35.378]  Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse?
[02:41:35.398 --> 02:41:39.020]  To me it sounded like an explosion.
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:44.402]  All the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the senior military officials in the U.S.
[02:41:44.442 --> 02:41:49.885]  government signing off on a plan that outrageous is extraordinary to me.
[02:41:57.702 --> 02:41:59.282]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:59.322 --> 02:42:00.143]  Welcome back.
[02:42:01.283 --> 02:42:02.383]  Do any of you feel safe?
[02:42:04.184 --> 02:42:08.165]  I mean, in 63, they just killed one guy and then a couple hundred to cover it up.
[02:42:10.225 --> 02:42:16.647]  Then in 93, they tried to blow up one of the whole towers, but thank God the people they trained didn't park it right up against the column, didn't do it.
[02:42:16.947 --> 02:42:17.667]  World Trade Center.
[02:42:17.687 --> 02:42:19.147]  Then in 93, they, you know,
[02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:26.591]  Killed some people at Waco, but that was just to demonize and set the precedent to attack, quote, cults.
[02:42:26.631 --> 02:42:30.853]  Then, a few years later, in 95, they killed 160-something.
[02:42:30.993 --> 02:42:31.434]  What, 168?
[02:42:33.234 --> 02:42:37.697]  And then on 9-11, folks, they killed almost 3,000 people.
[02:42:38.637 --> 02:42:47.041]  So, if you look at how things grow each time, we're talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions next time.
[02:42:49.122 --> 02:42:50.323]  They will stop at nothing.
[02:42:51.272 --> 02:42:52.113]  They will never stop.
[02:42:52.133 --> 02:42:55.375]  Let me tell you, right now they're not invincible.
[02:42:55.495 --> 02:43:16.649]  If they get the strategic bomber forces under robotic satellite control, which they're going to have within just five, six years, laden with neutron weapons, neutron bombs and hydrogen weapons, and if they get the Air Force switched over to robotic and enough ground deployment forces,
[02:43:17.914 --> 02:43:28.099]  You're dealing where the elite can actually attack the population, claim somebody else did it, do whatever they want, and actually have the elite, a tiny group of people, in actual control.
[02:43:28.139 --> 02:43:32.641]  For the first time in history, they can literally do whatever they want, and kill whoever they want.
[02:43:33.162 --> 02:43:41.125]  And they're a bunch of eugenic freaks, who all they do is go to eugenics conferences and sit around and talk about it, and fund it, and talk about how they're super genetics.
[02:43:41.165 --> 02:43:42.326]  I mean, that's their religion.
[02:43:43.064 --> 02:43:48.669]  And they can't wait to build a control grid, using 9-11 as the pretext, to kill us in an orderly fashion.
[02:43:53.093 --> 02:43:58.618]  I'm sorry that that's the truth, and I'm sorry that the real world's a scary place, and I'm sorry that that's what we face.
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:01.241]  They could use super-plagues.
[02:44:01.261 --> 02:44:04.503]  They'll probably use genetically engineered, race-specific bioweapons.
[02:44:04.564 --> 02:44:08.227]  It probably won't be, not by fire, but by bioweapon.
[02:44:13.849 --> 02:44:16.931]  Not by fire, but by the cold shakes of bio-warfare.
[02:44:21.673 --> 02:44:22.773]  Now I'm so sick of it.
[02:44:22.833 --> 02:44:35.219]  I mean, we have a guild of the priests of power who revel in the unmitigated, unadulterated, unrestricted, absolute exercise of power.
[02:44:35.980 --> 02:44:42.303]  Every control freak, every criminal, every psychopath you've ever known, every creepy person you've ever known with
[02:44:43.168 --> 02:44:43.308]  I think?
[02:45:02.971 --> 02:45:22.369]  Scientifically built and focused and being used against us, and you've got the general public running around giggling, busting their hind ends to be able to buy baubles and trinkets and symbols of power, which are just churned out of the slave factories of the New World Order that mean nothing.
[02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:24.851]  They tell you what to care about, which isn't real.
[02:45:27.162 --> 02:45:28.523]  That's why I don't have time, folks.
[02:45:28.603 --> 02:45:34.305]  I don't have time for people that work around me, that play games, that I've been around, and who try to control me.
[02:45:34.685 --> 02:45:37.726]  I don't have time for people in the community that snipe at me and lie about me.
[02:45:37.746 --> 02:45:40.628]  I don't have time for anyone to mess with me.
[02:45:40.648 --> 02:45:42.348]  I am on a mission.
[02:45:42.708 --> 02:45:43.309]  Period.
[02:45:45.169 --> 02:45:47.690]  And that's why I get so angry when I get distracted from it.
[02:45:49.911 --> 02:45:51.032]  Help me in this mission.
[02:45:51.252 --> 02:45:51.772]  Join me.
[02:45:52.132 --> 02:45:52.833]  Not behind me.
[02:45:52.953 --> 02:45:53.553]  Beside me.
[02:45:53.653 --> 02:45:54.253]  In front of me.
[02:45:55.374 --> 02:45:56.134]  We're here together.
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:45:59.601]  This is real.
[02:46:00.662 --> 02:46:02.863]  And I don't have words to describe how serious it is.
[02:46:03.144 --> 02:46:06.166]  You know it's really, really, really bad.
[02:46:07.427 --> 02:46:08.668]  Let's jam a few calls in here.
[02:46:08.728 --> 02:46:09.549]  Who's up first here?
[02:46:11.951 --> 02:46:13.012]  Jim in Texas, go ahead.
[02:46:13.032 --> 02:46:15.253]  Hey there, Mr. Jones.
[02:46:15.294 --> 02:46:16.214]  How you doing?
[02:46:16.555 --> 02:46:17.415]  I guess I'm doing alright.
[02:46:18.516 --> 02:46:26.262]  I was just calling on behalf of... I was watching this commercial the other day, or it was actually a television
[02:46:27.523 --> 02:46:30.946]  Where do you think video games came from?
[02:46:30.966 --> 02:46:34.709]  Oh, they came from the higher intelligent people in the military.
[02:46:51.118 --> 02:46:58.741]  They were training aides to artificially install Kill Instinct, your reflex of fire.
[02:46:59.481 --> 02:47:04.043]  Yeah, yeah, and that kind of intrigued me because I play the game myself all the time, you know.
[02:47:04.603 --> 02:47:11.645]  But the thing is, is they got in-depth, detailed training on what you would actually do in the military, you know.
[02:47:11.785 --> 02:47:19.788]  What do you think simulators, you fly a simulator to learn how to fly an aircraft and to stay up on it, and see, I mean, these are killing simulators.
[02:47:20.368 --> 02:47:28.212]  Yeah, yeah, and it's really intriguing because, I mean, the thing is that I just want to kind of, you know, help you out too as well.
[02:47:28.693 --> 02:47:47.063]  I want the world to kind of open their eyes because, I mean, everything that people, even around you, that, you know, that you ain't even paying attention to the conversation that they're talking about, but some of the things that people say are pertaining to half of the stuff that, you know, is going on in this world, but, you know, it seems like they don't even care about it, you know?
[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:48.781]  Well, they're going to find out.
[02:47:48.821 --> 02:47:55.066]  Listen, you act like a bunch of sheep out there on the field and tell yourself there's not wolves in the world, you're going to get your guts torn out.
[02:47:55.686 --> 02:48:03.172]  I heard a comment, as a matter of fact, last night on the Inferno 3, the television show Inferno 3.
[02:48:04.753 --> 02:48:12.579]  A gentleman, one of them kids got on there and said, the evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
[02:48:13.532 --> 02:48:14.794]  Those are his words.
[02:48:16.515 --> 02:48:17.636]  What show is this on?
[02:48:18.377 --> 02:48:19.178]  Inferno 3.
[02:48:19.998 --> 02:48:22.080]  Listen, I've got to jump, but put all that in the story.
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:22.761]  E-mail it to us.
[02:48:22.781 --> 02:48:23.362]  We'll post it.
[02:48:23.862 --> 02:48:26.865]  I mean, put your observations together of the media.
[02:48:26.885 --> 02:48:27.746]  We'll start posting them.
[02:48:28.326 --> 02:48:30.768]  Look, they train you that torturing children is good on 24.
[02:48:31.549 --> 02:48:38.956]  They're indoctrinating you, bathing you in the wickedness, seducing you into psychopathic appetites.
[02:48:45.305 --> 02:48:50.754]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:51.134 --> 02:48:58.746]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:06.523]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:06.903 --> 02:49:18.328]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:18.648 --> 02:49:22.130]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:22.610 --> 02:49:24.531]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:24.871 --> 02:49:28.713]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:34.736 --> 02:50:44.021]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:44.241 --> 02:50:47.943]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:48.263 --> 02:50:57.188]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:50:57.348 --> 02:51:02.210]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:02.350 --> 02:51:02.851]  We're good.
[02:51:20.387 --> 02:51:20.987]  That's it!
[02:51:54.529 --> 02:51:55.770]  Alright folks, final segment.
[02:51:55.810 --> 02:51:57.291]  I've got a camera and a call or two here.
[02:51:57.532 --> 02:51:58.412]  Maybe Johnny and Pat.
[02:51:58.432 --> 02:51:59.753]  I want to go to JD, Tom, everybody.
[02:51:59.773 --> 02:52:01.395]  But we just can't do it all here.
[02:52:01.975 --> 02:52:03.176]  Try to have more open phones tomorrow.
[02:52:03.596 --> 02:52:04.717]  But we'll try to take a few in a second.
[02:52:05.058 --> 02:52:05.898]  If I don't quit babbling.
[02:52:06.519 --> 02:52:07.440]  Just talking about video games.
[02:52:07.460 --> 02:52:09.101]  There's lots of video game things I could play.
[02:52:09.121 --> 02:52:12.043]  But here's the one we've got where the UN takes over and saves us.
[02:52:12.123 --> 02:52:14.085]  And this is just total conditioning.
[02:52:14.105 --> 02:52:15.786]  And most of the games are like this.
[02:52:16.347 --> 02:52:16.747]  Here it is.
[02:52:17.788 --> 02:52:20.050]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote,
[02:52:20.740 --> 02:52:21.200]  The U.S.
[02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:24.303]  Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S.
[02:52:24.343 --> 02:52:29.567]  history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th President of the United States.
[02:52:30.167 --> 02:52:34.931]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting, and a growing number of militias
[02:52:35.339 --> 02:52:38.001]  ...have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[02:52:40.022 --> 02:52:47.147]  In response, the President invokes the Homeland Security Act, and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[02:52:47.727 --> 02:52:55.953]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[02:52:57.113 --> 02:53:04.038]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[02:53:06.232 --> 02:53:10.075]  During the 57th Inauguration Day Ceremonies, Washington D.C.
[02:53:10.195 --> 02:53:15.599]  is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon, killing David Adams and most of the U.S.
[02:53:15.619 --> 02:53:16.039]  Congress.
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:20.222]  The destruction of Washington D.C.
[02:53:20.682 --> 02:53:24.545]  effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[02:53:25.265 --> 02:53:30.389]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C.
[02:53:30.549 --> 02:53:32.971]  area to secure international interest.
[02:53:34.429 --> 02:53:41.830]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union.
[02:53:42.631 --> 02:53:49.712]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[02:53:51.672 --> 02:53:51.952]  Now.
[02:53:54.333 --> 02:53:58.793]  The once United States of America lie in ruin.
[02:53:59.714 --> 02:54:01.494]  The time for words has passed.
[02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:08.317]  And the Second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[02:54:09.859 --> 02:54:12.563]  They battle one another to reclaim a nation.
[02:54:13.825 --> 02:54:14.947]  To restore peace.
[02:54:16.288 --> 02:54:19.293]  To rebuild this shattered union.
[02:54:23.001 --> 02:54:28.643]  And the incredible thing is, that's actually a New World Order plan with the Southwest and Civil War they plan to scur up.
[02:54:28.923 --> 02:54:34.285]  It wouldn't be that big and go on that long, but they want to take us out of the game.
[02:54:35.826 --> 02:54:37.307]  And they're really setting up for that.
[02:54:37.567 --> 02:54:39.767]  I mean, here's the Associated Press.
[02:54:39.968 --> 02:54:42.008]  Oh, the New York cops will be working for the UN.
[02:54:42.108 --> 02:54:44.769]  Oh, and going, I mean, it's just... When does it end?
[02:54:44.869 --> 02:54:45.750]  When does it stop?
[02:54:45.870 --> 02:54:46.230]  You know what?
[02:54:46.270 --> 02:54:48.771]  I can't take calls, because I just remembered I've got to cover this, I promise to.
[02:54:49.051 --> 02:54:50.131]  Can't even plug my films!
[02:54:50.171 --> 02:54:51.252]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:52.159 --> 02:54:53.259]  Because I said I'd cover this.
[02:54:53.580 --> 02:55:01.362]  Monsanto's GM corn, MON863, shows kidney liver toxicity in animal studies.
[02:55:02.803 --> 02:55:04.223]  And this is from News Target.
[02:55:04.263 --> 02:55:05.404]  It goes through all the documents.
[02:55:06.984 --> 02:55:11.966]  It says the corn in question, MON863, is made by the Monsanto company.
[02:55:12.226 --> 02:55:13.146]  It's made by them.
[02:55:13.606 --> 02:55:18.268]  And approved for use in Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and the Philippines.
[02:55:18.768 --> 02:55:19.609]  And the United States.
[02:55:19.729 --> 02:55:20.929]  And by the way, they're all toxic.
[02:55:21.943 --> 02:55:23.985]  I've had scientists, Nobel Prize winners on.
[02:55:24.685 --> 02:55:26.027]  I mean, these are official studies.
[02:55:26.087 --> 02:55:26.607]  Hundreds of them.
[02:55:26.627 --> 02:55:27.868]  And they keep them quiet, most of them.
[02:55:28.289 --> 02:55:29.189]  I mean, just kill stuff.
[02:55:29.810 --> 02:55:30.711]  Just keep gobbling.
[02:55:30.731 --> 02:55:31.631]  Let the bees die.
[02:55:32.372 --> 02:55:33.973]  Let's just have a global warming tax, though.
[02:55:33.993 --> 02:55:34.614]  Totally fake.
[02:55:35.475 --> 02:55:43.902]  It has had a gene inserted from bacteria Bacillus thrunigenesis, Bt, which causes the plant cells to produce a pesticide.
[02:55:44.402 --> 02:55:45.163]  And this is the one.
[02:55:45.183 --> 02:55:46.724]  This is a separate deal.
[02:55:46.744 --> 02:55:47.545]  This was with rats.
[02:55:48.546 --> 02:55:49.347]  And this was with, uh,
[02:55:51.016 --> 02:55:51.857]  Other mammals.
[02:55:52.397 --> 02:55:54.319]  And this is a thing they link to killing the bees.
[02:55:54.799 --> 02:56:01.745]  And it goes into say researchers fed rats either modified corn or diets containing 11 or 30 percent of the engineered corn.
[02:56:01.765 --> 02:56:07.990]  The rats who ate the modified corn were found to exhibit signs of liver and kidney toxicity as well as signs of hormonal changes.
[02:56:09.271 --> 02:56:12.013]  Male rats lost an average of 3.3 percent of their body weight.
[02:56:12.033 --> 02:56:12.573]  And it goes on.
[02:56:13.094 --> 02:56:14.375]  Keep feeding your kids at all.
[02:56:14.395 --> 02:56:15.236]  We're all going to eat it.
[02:56:15.276 --> 02:56:16.757]  I guess we're all going to die.
[02:56:17.503 --> 02:56:18.684]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:18.724 --> 02:56:19.285]  Back tomorrow.
[02:56:19.305 --> 02:56:20.225]  God bless you all!
