[00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:06.156]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:07.876]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:09.676]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:11.157]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:12.817]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:17.178]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.658 --> 00:00:21.759]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.041]  Once again, deep behind enemy lines, fighting the info war...
[00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:31.732]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Program.
[00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:37.319]  I'm Jack Blood, your radio gun, sitting in for Alex Jones today for the next three hours.
[00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:40.515]  Thank you very much for joining us.
[00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:08.798]  We're good to go.
[00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:09.098]  I think?
[00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:30.881]  President Eisenhower gave his exit speech in which he warned the nation about the military industrial complex.
[00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.082]  So we will have some commentary on that.
[00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:36.725]  We'll play a clip from that speech on the program today.
[00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:41.748]  Of course, nothing more relevant today than that warning.
[00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:48.192]  And we can debate exactly why he gave us that warning, but the fact is he did give us the warning.
[00:01:48.232 --> 00:01:48.793]  He should know.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.662]  And, of course, we did not heed the warning, and thus we find ourselves in the situation we are in today.
[00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:05.385]  Also, on this day, 1991, 16 years ago today, the Gulf War, Desert Storm, kicked off in the Middle East.
[00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:09.387]  Thus began a 16-year war.
[00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:13.388]  I hope we don't have to add 16 more years to this.
[00:02:13.408 --> 00:02:14.688]  A 16-year war in Iraq.
[00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:23.551]  Also on today's program, we'll talk about auto-scanning of every license plate for crime and terror.
[00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:28.113]  That again, anticipating that you might be a terrorist, that you might be a criminal.
[00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:32.455]  Of course, many constitutional problems with this.
[00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:39.698]  We'll talk about the $400,000 awarded in a racial profiling case on an airline.
[00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:41.128]  Many pundits...
[00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.691]  We're good to go.
[00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:09.971]  I think?
[00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:57.860]  And one of the deadliest days in Baghdad, 100 killed by suicide bombs this morning, or today, as they're quite a bit ahead of us at Baghdad time, showing that the insurgents, the freedom fighters, the enemy combatants, this was talked about on the recent episode of 24, the evil terrorist reclassifies enemy combatants as freedom fighters, either way,
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.001]  They are amping up their attack.
[00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:12.965]  So even the thought of this troop surge, and only a few thousand extra troops have already arrived through Kuwait at this point, has set off even more deadly violence.
[00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:21.067]  This is exactly what the troops feared, and for that matter, what Oliver North even feared, would happen as we escalate the war.
[00:04:21.107 --> 00:04:22.548]  This happened in Vietnam, didn't it?
[00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:30.150]  Had some turmoil, some sectarian violence, some civil war going on between the Koreas.
[00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.353]  We stepped in, we started escalating, and things got worse.
[00:04:34.993 --> 00:04:40.076]  Also, the doomsday clock has moved forward two minutes.
[00:04:40.617 --> 00:04:42.578]  Tick-tock, tick-tock.
[00:04:43.138 --> 00:04:44.179]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:45.860]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.681]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:48.682]  We'll be right back after this.
[00:05:04.395 --> 00:05:07.556]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:09.857]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.217 --> 00:05:17.881]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:25.604]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:28.945]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:31.646]  The White House proven to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:32.907]  NSA spies.
[00:05:33.462 --> 00:05:36.724]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.222]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:07.443]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:13.867]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:14.247 --> 00:06:21.551]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:25.833]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:26.113 --> 00:06:31.636]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:44.942]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:06:45.162 --> 00:06:53.766]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places USA now for only $29 plus shipping and handling by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:06:54.587 --> 00:06:56.275]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:02.047]  It's no secret.
[00:07:02.307 --> 00:07:07.788]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[00:07:07.968 --> 00:07:12.749]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:15.369]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.150]  Well, there is an alternative, and it's called Novio.
[00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:26.551]  Novio eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[00:07:26.731 --> 00:07:31.032]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in Novio.
[00:07:31.032 --> 00:07:31.592]  We're good to go.
[00:07:31.672 --> 00:07:32.533]  We're good to go.
[00:07:32.573 --> 00:07:33.114]  We're good to go.
[00:08:02.737 --> 00:08:08.763]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:12.427]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:26.261]  From the Deadline Live bunker, deep behind enemy lines, far across town from the InfoWars studios, Jack Blood with you, hosting the Alex Jones Program.
[00:08:27.242 --> 00:08:30.303]  Bob Dacey will be sitting in with you for the next two days.
[00:08:30.403 --> 00:08:32.143]  And Bob just does a fantastic job.
[00:08:32.183 --> 00:08:33.564]  Has a lot of great information.
[00:08:33.624 --> 00:08:35.384]  And please make him feel at home.
[00:08:35.424 --> 00:08:37.285]  Make him feel welcome on the program as well.
[00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:40.706]  We're all really just caretakers of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:40.726 --> 00:08:46.567]  While he is away from the ice and the cold, which has shut down Austin, Texas.
[00:08:46.747 --> 00:08:49.408]  The government, the airports, just about everything here.
[00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:52.069]  Recharging his batteries.
[00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:57.281]  And he already, I know, is chomping at the bit to get back on the air with you folks.
[00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.582]  He'll be back on Monday.
[00:08:58.622 --> 00:09:01.383]  We'll all look forward to having Alex back on the program.
[00:09:01.964 --> 00:09:03.625]  We have a good show for you today.
[00:09:03.705 --> 00:09:17.654]  As I mentioned earlier, today is the 46th anniversary of President Eisenhower's exit speech, which took place January 17, 1961, warning us of the military-industrial complex.
[00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:21.216]  And yes, many people now will say, and it is a no-brainer,
[00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:42.862]  Having these military machinations, these giant companies who create the machinery and the products which go into perpetual war, was the most dangerous thing we could ever face, and we are really reaping the whirlwind now, I think it's fair to say.
[00:09:42.882 --> 00:09:47.023]  I want to play just about a two-minute clip of the Eisenhower speech.
[00:09:47.283 --> 00:09:49.083]  I think this is put together very nicely.
[00:09:49.504 --> 00:09:50.764]  It's on YouTube.com.
[00:09:58.547 --> 00:10:01.528]  Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
[00:10:02.228 --> 00:10:03.809]  Good evening, my fellow Americans.
[00:10:04.569 --> 00:10:11.691]  We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.
[00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:24.555]  Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry.
[00:10:25.895 --> 00:10:28.196]  American makers of plowshares could,
[00:10:29.099 --> 00:10:32.421]  With time, and as required, make swords as well.
[00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:38.263]  But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.
[00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:44.486]  We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.
[00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:52.590]  Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment.
[00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:58.012]  Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry
[00:10:58.746 --> 00:11:01.007]  is new in the American experience.
[00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:12.334]  The total influence, economic, political, even spiritual, is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government.
[00:11:13.275 --> 00:11:21.279]  We recognize the imperative need for this development, yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.822]  Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved.
[00:11:26.778 --> 00:11:28.859]  So is the very structure of our society.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:40.806]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[00:11:42.066 --> 00:11:47.329]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:54.013]  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
[00:11:54.993 --> 00:11:56.314]  We should take nothing for granted
[00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:01.654]  Well, of course, as we know, a man who wants liberty and security...
[00:12:22.681 --> 00:12:24.782]  So many times deserves neither.
[00:12:25.102 --> 00:12:29.144]  I believe that Eisenhower had a unique insight into all of this.
[00:12:29.204 --> 00:12:34.125]  He, of course, was behind closed doors with some of the movers and shakers.
[00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:36.927]  I call them the neo-pharaohs of the world.
[00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:45.790]  I'm sure he took a gander more than once at some of the plans that they had for us cannon fodder, us sheeple here in America.
[00:12:46.772 --> 00:12:47.413]  We're good to go.
[00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:16.185]  So many of you asked why Ike was able to get away with that speech.
[00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:25.529]  I think we can either look at it as he completely surprised the military-industrial complex, or the growing military-industrial complex, much in the same way that Kennedy had.
[00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:35.994]  And there were two presidents back-to-back that I think, in many ways, after taking office, understood the dire situation that we were heading for.
[00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:40.920]  Usually the opposite happens.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:49.587]  You could take a good man, and you can put him behind the Oval Office desk, and he will turn evil faster than you can spell E-V-I-L.
[00:13:51.048 --> 00:13:55.872]  Now, this is a concept that is not new to America.
[00:13:55.912 --> 00:13:58.714]  This is not a 46-year-old concept.
[00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:06.720]  James Madison said, If tyranny and oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy.
[00:14:08.684 --> 00:14:15.388]  John Quincy Adams said, America is the well-wisher to freedom and independence of all.
[00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:22.813]  She is the champion and the caretaker of only her own.
[00:14:31.838 --> 00:14:33.639]  It's hard for me to even quote some of these quotes.
[00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:38.322]  It is absolutely dire that we understand this concept.
[00:14:39.418 --> 00:14:55.955]  Our founding fathers knew that standing military forces and those behind the scenes who would pull the strings and use war to control the people were exactly why this country was founded and what we had vowed to stay away from.
[00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:10.688]  The term military-industrial complex, MIC, refers to a close and symbiotic relationship between a nation's armed forces and its arms industry and associated political and commercial interests, i.e.
[00:15:10.788 --> 00:15:11.950]  the Carlyle Group.
[00:15:12.748 --> 00:15:23.136]  In such a system, the military is dependent on industry to supply material and other support, while the defense industry depends on government for a steady revenue stream.
[00:15:23.176 --> 00:15:31.282]  The term is most often used in reference to the United States, where it gained popularity after its use in the farewell address of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[00:15:32.183 --> 00:15:39.649]  As a pejorative term, the military-industrial complex, or the Iron Triangle, referred to an institutionalized collusion
[00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:52.030]  Among defense contractors, industry, the Pentagon, military, and the United States government, Congress and the executive branch as a cartel that works against public interest.
[00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.912]  Whose motivation is profiteering.
[00:15:55.972 --> 00:16:22.730]  And, you know, look, this is the thing, folks, and you talk to a lot of leftists, and I guess they'll tell you it's all about profit, it's all about lining their pockets, and in many ways it is about sucking the real wealth out of this country and out of the world at large in general, putting us into debt so that we will be their slaves, so that they again can confiscate any real property or real material wealth to go along with the ones and zeros they call wealth,
[00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:24.391]  Certainly.
[00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:26.151]  All of that is true.
[00:16:26.311 --> 00:16:29.292]  And we just touched on this.
[00:16:29.472 --> 00:16:36.174]  As a control mechanism, there is nothing better than perpetual war in order to control the people.
[00:16:37.035 --> 00:16:40.096]  And, of course, this is where the United Nations comes in.
[00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:43.257]  And the big oil for food scandal broke yesterday.
[00:16:43.277 --> 00:16:49.939]  It appears that Kofi Annan, being out of the loop, he was kind of the Al Capone involved in this operation.
[00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:55.591]  I guess you can, if you had a Rico, you can charge on Kofi Annan and the United Nations.
[00:16:55.631 --> 00:17:01.454]  I'm sure you could take him down, but it appears now that many people in the United Nations were taking bribes from Saddam Hussein.
[00:17:01.494 --> 00:17:05.876]  And yes, that sounds a lot like right-wing propaganda, but no doubt it was true.
[00:17:05.896 --> 00:17:07.477]  But this is where the United Nations comes in.
[00:17:07.517 --> 00:17:13.099]  This is where the lovers of global government, regional government and consolidation come in.
[00:17:13.159 --> 00:17:14.140]  And they will tell you...
[00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:32.175]  That the only way to stop all these wars, not to cut the funding to the military-industrial complex, no, not to use preemptive strikes in order to go after imaginary weapons of mass destruction, or even fight the illusory war on terror.
[00:17:33.736 --> 00:17:43.179]  The only way to avoid these massive wars going forward is to all join together as one world government!
[00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:47.110]  Of course, there'll be no more wars at that point.
[00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:52.373]  There'll be no more need for a military-industrial complex, and that's, of course, a lot of horse hockey.
[00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:55.255]  Excuse my Irish.
[00:17:57.056 --> 00:18:01.298]  It's a lot of horse hockey, because there will be skirmishes going forward if we...
[00:18:02.348 --> 00:18:06.130]  Went through and hypothetically put the one world government through today.
[00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:17.115]  There would be constant struggles, constant revolutions, constant wars going on that will have to be monitored by the global military, which is being assembled now as we speak.
[00:18:17.815 --> 00:18:19.756]  There is no end to it.
[00:18:21.217 --> 00:18:22.057]  There is no end.
[00:18:22.097 --> 00:18:27.319]  The only end to stopping perpetual war is to stop the people that are engineering the wars.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.781]  And the only way to do that, in my humble opinion...
[00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:36.089]  Is to get people up to speed on the military-industrial complex.
[00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.893]  To get people up to speed on the false flag terrorism.
[00:18:41.274 --> 00:18:44.757]  To get people up to speed on a government that hates you.
[00:18:44.777 --> 00:18:56.128]  And to quote the immortal Bill Hicks, to understand and to help others understand that not just the United States government, not just the
[00:18:57.134 --> 00:19:03.158]  United Kingdom, not just Russia or China, but all governments are liars and murderers.
[00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:06.600]  And that's something we need to teach our children.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.563]  That's something that should be taught in schools or homeschools.
[00:19:11.523 --> 00:19:18.788]  That's something that needs to be relayed to all of our neighbors, our co-workers, our friends, our loved ones, and people in the street.
[00:19:19.288 --> 00:19:25.292]  And until we realize this, until this becomes a mass shift in consciousness...
[00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.070]  We're good to go.
[00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.951]  We're good to go.
[00:20:01.488 --> 00:20:09.334]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:20:09.574 --> 00:20:11.176]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:20:11.416 --> 00:20:13.898]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:28.869]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:29.229]  government.
[00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.191]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:37.476]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.596 --> 00:20:42.080]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[00:21:01.306 --> 00:21:03.848]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:04.369 --> 00:21:09.674]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:16.520]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[00:21:17.181 --> 00:21:20.024]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.

[00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:03.563]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.203 --> 00:22:13.127]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.607 --> 00:22:20.770]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.497 --> 00:22:25.362]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lace-Med Inc.'

[00:22:39.077 --> 00:22:41.080]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:22:44.642 --> 00:22:48.224]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[00:22:48.244 --> 00:22:51.746]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.761]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:23:13.801 --> 00:23:19.563]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[00:23:20.103 --> 00:23:29.367]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:23:30.127 --> 00:23:35.730]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.351]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:23:39.946 --> 00:23:40.947]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:20.798]  Thanks for joining us again, folks.
[00:24:20.818 --> 00:24:21.758]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:23.400]  Jack Blood filling in today.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.204]  The last day for the Alex Jones program.
[00:24:27.304 --> 00:24:30.847]  We are looking forward to having Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul, running for President 08.
[00:24:31.728 --> 00:24:37.914]  Joining us in his first, as far as I'm aware of, his first interview since announcing his presidential run.
[00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:44.653]  In 2008, Republican Congressman Ron Paul likely joining us sometime on the program today.
[00:24:44.933 --> 00:24:46.114]  Just a quick program note.
[00:24:46.134 --> 00:24:48.315]  We had a caller call in and ask a good question.
[00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:56.360]  Yesterday we had Sal Costello on the program talking about a local activist position here against the toll roads and the NAFTA highway.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.602]  We have had just the craziest ice storm here.
[00:25:01.642 --> 00:25:04.584]  We are packed under ice here in Austin, Texas.
[00:25:06.103 --> 00:25:07.184]  Climate change, anyone?
[00:25:07.704 --> 00:25:15.087]  But it's really made getting around very, very difficult, and I certainly don't want anyone risking their lives to do this.
[00:25:15.127 --> 00:25:20.188]  It is important, but not so important that I want you with your kids on the icy road.
[00:25:20.288 --> 00:25:22.669]  So be careful if you're going down.
[00:25:22.769 --> 00:25:25.931]  Right now, the meeting is on, unless we hear otherwise.
[00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:34.934]  Sal had promised to email me if he hears anything different, but until we hear that the meeting is shut down, and we may have about a dozen people on this,
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:48.329]  We will have to assume it's going forward, and at some point we might even have to assume that this is the ideal circumstance for the Campo board, who will be voting on their Phase 2 toll roads, or at least getting your opinions on that today.
[00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:54.493]  I'm sure they can guarantee a pretty low turnout because of the weather.
[00:25:54.573 --> 00:25:59.438]  So we'll see if they'll risk their lives to go in to push this measure through.
[00:25:59.478 --> 00:26:03.482]  And then maybe this will become more of a priority for us.
[00:26:03.502 --> 00:26:03.862]  Who knows?
[00:26:03.923 --> 00:26:10.969]  But we'll keep you posted during our five hours of broadcasting today on GCN and let you know if that meeting is off.
[00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:12.431]  But until we hear otherwise...
[00:26:12.851 --> 00:26:13.852]  We're good to go.
[00:26:32.842 --> 00:26:34.784]  And that's something we've really gotten away from.
[00:26:34.804 --> 00:26:42.910]  And of course, the famous Thomas Jefferson quote, the spirit of this country is totally adverse to a large military force.
[00:26:44.291 --> 00:26:46.933]  Oh, but Jack, things have changed since 9-11.
[00:26:48.855 --> 00:26:52.198]  This has been going on low these 60 years.
[00:26:53.138 --> 00:26:55.780]  And there's always a pretext for it, isn't there?
[00:26:56.021 --> 00:27:01.205]  There's always a convenient pretext, and it seems the next pretext is always better than the former.
[00:27:02.273 --> 00:27:05.415]  I mean, we could fight communism, and communism was an idea.
[00:27:05.435 --> 00:27:08.156]  It wasn't a country with a uniform.
[00:27:08.196 --> 00:27:10.158]  It was an insidious idea.
[00:27:10.178 --> 00:27:20.524]  And, of course, we had the Red Scare and the conditioning of the people, where, as a child, I was told to hide under my desk when the Russians nuked us.
[00:27:20.984 --> 00:27:22.124]  Which, of course, saved me.
[00:27:26.747 --> 00:27:29.809]  But, you know, these are the seeds we've certainly sown.
[00:27:30.469 --> 00:27:33.571]  I'm going to open up the phone lines until further notice.
[00:27:33.591 --> 00:27:33.711]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:27:33.731 --> 00:27:33.791]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:35.973]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:27:35.993 --> 00:27:39.815]  Bush cronies profit from war in Iraq while our soldiers die every day.
[00:27:39.915 --> 00:27:45.059]  And this is a bit of a flashback from a story that was published in 2004, and it's certainly become much worse.
[00:28:00.152 --> 00:28:03.633]  And it talks about not auditing the war.
[00:28:03.693 --> 00:28:06.634]  No one overseeing the money spent on the war.
[00:28:06.694 --> 00:28:13.056]  It talks about the projected $2 trillion that we're spending into Iraq alone.
[00:28:13.076 --> 00:28:27.761]  It talks about the collusion and creative bookkeeping from the United Nations International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the International Advisory and Monitoring Board, who have actually complained about some of this bookkeeping.
[00:28:29.031 --> 00:28:39.256]  Talks about Halliburton, Halliburton contracts, providing for importing and distributing fuels to keep Iraq going during the occupation and the rebuilding.
[00:28:39.997 --> 00:28:53.844]  As we know now, that they were scheming off the top of this and charging the United States, and not the taxpayers, not you anyway, maybe your grandchildren, extra kickbacks on each gallon of gas.
[00:28:53.884 --> 00:28:55.385]  Talks about KMG.
[00:28:55.405 --> 00:28:55.445]  Uh...
[00:28:58.317 --> 00:29:09.383]  Another auditing firm which has gone down, I believe, since this article was put out, talks about the Bechtel Group, the San Francisco-based company with solid connections to the Bush White House.
[00:29:10.184 --> 00:29:26.913]  President Ronald Reagan's former Secretary of State, George Shultz, is on the board, and a senior vice president is Jack Sheehan, a member of the Defense Policy Board, which advises Defense Secretary, ex-Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:34.133]  Bechtel, back two years ago, got a $680 million contract just from one agency, okay?
[00:29:36.134 --> 00:29:37.655]  So the stories are there.
[00:29:37.695 --> 00:29:42.338]  The stories add up, and the military complex, industrial or otherwise, is looming.
[00:29:42.378 --> 00:29:43.458]  We'll be right back after this, folks.
[00:29:43.478 --> 00:29:49.561]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:51.582 --> 00:29:52.523]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.983 --> 00:29:54.484]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.499 --> 00:29:58.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:07.142]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley, and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[00:30:07.502 --> 00:30:10.463]  Since that time, I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[00:30:10.863 --> 00:30:14.744]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with building blocks for good health.
[00:30:15.184 --> 00:30:19.205]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[00:30:19.838 --> 00:30:25.001]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[00:30:25.422 --> 00:30:28.203]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery.
[00:30:28.604 --> 00:30:29.384]  And Jim said no.
[00:30:29.864 --> 00:30:34.147]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others but never been surpassed.
[00:30:34.588 --> 00:30:37.089]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops 4-ounce bottle for only $79.99.
[00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:44.633]  Call the Power Hour at 877-817-9829, 877-817-9829.
[00:30:45.293 --> 00:30:48.575]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula.
[00:30:48.835 --> 00:30:51.056]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[00:30:51.076 --> 00:30:51.356]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:30:51.376 --> 00:30:54.137]  Now you can really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[00:31:01.633 --> 00:31:06.194]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:09.536]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:09.856 --> 00:31:12.416]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:12.777 --> 00:31:17.598]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:17.978 --> 00:31:23.340]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.621]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:28.522]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[00:31:29.462 --> 00:31:38.465]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included, which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13, 17.
[00:31:38.805 --> 00:31:45.087]  In Revelations 14, 9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[00:31:45.427 --> 00:31:47.048]  It says, worship the beast.
[00:31:47.328 --> 00:31:49.929]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[00:31:50.209 --> 00:31:50.450]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:32:01.647 --> 00:32:02.228]  It's a fact.
[00:32:02.428 --> 00:32:06.871]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:32:07.311 --> 00:32:12.495]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:32:12.796 --> 00:32:15.998]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[00:32:16.258 --> 00:32:23.364]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:32:23.664 --> 00:32:24.684]  It's time to turn your life around.
[00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.791]  Call Day of Jubilee.
[00:32:45.971 --> 00:32:46.891]  Open 9 a.m.
[00:32:46.931 --> 00:32:47.751]  to 5 p.m.
[00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:49.032]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[00:32:49.052 --> 00:32:49.232]  That's 920-293-8024.
[00:32:49.312 --> 00:32:50.192]  And ask for Robert.
[00:32:50.272 --> 00:32:51.793]  Don't wait any longer to get your life.
[00:32:51.853 --> 00:32:53.834]  Day after day Alone on a hill
[00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:36.683]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool And he never gives an answer But the fool under him Sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head
[00:33:37.219 --> 00:33:38.720]  Thank you for tuning in, folks.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:43.604]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network, 17th day of January 2007.
[00:33:43.864 --> 00:33:47.247]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:33:47.267 --> 00:33:47.347]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:47.367 --> 00:33:47.427]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:47.447 --> 00:33:48.668]  Ron Paul has written a great article, the...
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:11.100]  A relevance of military victory, which you can find at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and hopefully...
[00:34:12.526 --> 00:34:17.691]  Congressman Paul will be joining us on the program today, and we'll try to give you a crack at him.
[00:34:17.711 --> 00:34:20.013]  1-800-259-9231, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:20.293 --> 00:34:27.239]  Call in, talk about anything you want, or reminisce about the military-industrial complex in 1991 on this day.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.523]  Operation Desert Storm began, allegedly, early in the morning.
[00:34:31.743 --> 00:34:37.749]  Iraq fired eight Scud missiles into Israel, an unsuccessful bid to provoke Israeli retaliation.
[00:34:38.542 --> 00:34:41.223]  There were several anniversaries with the Gulf War.
[00:34:41.243 --> 00:34:45.043]  This is just one of them, and we'll try to talk about that on the program today as well.
[00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:46.684]  Let's go to the phones.
[00:34:46.824 --> 00:34:48.484]  Is it to Joe in Pennsylvania?
[00:34:49.764 --> 00:34:50.504]  Yeah, this is Joe.
[00:34:50.544 --> 00:34:51.085]  How are you doing, Jack?
[00:34:51.285 --> 00:34:51.665]  I'm good.
[00:34:51.705 --> 00:34:52.365]  Thank you for calling.
[00:34:53.945 --> 00:34:55.625]  Well, thanks for filling in for Alex.
[00:34:55.645 --> 00:34:57.066]  You're doing a great job.
[00:34:57.086 --> 00:34:57.366]  Thank you.
[00:34:58.486 --> 00:35:03.147]  I wanted to say, first of all, it's great to have Ron Paul running for president and
[00:35:04.167 --> 00:35:11.792]  I'm going to do my part up here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to help his campaign in whatever way I can, whether it's knocking on doors or whatnot.
[00:35:12.393 --> 00:35:15.595]  He's a true champion of the American people.
[00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:28.163]  And I wish I had enough time to get into this story about how I'm getting totally screwed over by the Department of Transportation and the legal system up here in Pennsylvania.
[00:35:30.365 --> 00:35:32.326]  Well, give us the cliff notes real quick.
[00:35:33.544 --> 00:35:35.025]  Cliff Notes, okay.
[00:35:35.065 --> 00:35:35.825]  Is that possible?
[00:35:35.865 --> 00:35:37.426]  I know these stories get very complicated.
[00:35:38.007 --> 00:35:42.409]  It's even complicated for me, and I know everything that's happened to me, but I could try.
[00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:47.272]  Suffice to say, then, you're between a rock and a hard place there in Pennsylvania.
[00:35:49.133 --> 00:35:50.614]  Just give us a paragraph.
[00:35:50.634 --> 00:35:51.335]  What is the problem?
[00:35:53.176 --> 00:35:54.817]  In 2000, I got a DUI.
[00:35:55.437 --> 00:35:57.418]  I fled on an ARD.
[00:35:58.159 --> 00:36:01.421]  That's an accelerated rehabilitative disposition.
[00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:07.754]  In lieu of having to face the actual trial, I basically pleaded no contest to the DUI.
[00:36:08.575 --> 00:36:09.556]  And I was thrown probation.
[00:36:09.576 --> 00:36:10.737]  Did you take a breathalyzer?
[00:36:10.757 --> 00:36:12.978]  Uh, no.
[00:36:13.038 --> 00:36:14.940]  The breathalyzer was broken that night, if I remember.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.301]  They had to do a blood test on me.
[00:36:16.601 --> 00:36:17.342]  Okay.
[00:36:17.602 --> 00:36:19.183]  You volunteer for the blood test?
[00:36:20.124 --> 00:36:20.504]  Yeah.
[00:36:20.764 --> 00:36:21.565]  And how did it come out?
[00:36:23.246 --> 00:36:24.307]  Uh, I had a .12.
[00:36:24.487 --> 00:36:25.268]  At that time, it was .10.
[00:36:25.428 --> 00:36:26.069]  Okay.
[00:36:26.429 --> 00:36:27.330]  That's the limit.
[00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.790]  And, uh,
[00:36:28.427 --> 00:36:29.267]  Well, they amended that in 2001.
[00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:36.008]  And so they gave you some type of a diversion, perhaps, in order to work with them on the DUI?
[00:36:37.029 --> 00:36:37.329]  Right.
[00:36:37.969 --> 00:36:40.489]  And, I mean, I had a DUI.
[00:36:40.509 --> 00:36:44.470]  I was guilty of sin, and I don't drink and drive anymore, as a matter of fact.
[00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:44.850]  Good for you.
[00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.150]  Because I don't have a license.
[00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.410]  Right.
[00:36:48.551 --> 00:36:50.971]  Well, I did everything that they had asked me to do.
[00:36:50.991 --> 00:36:55.932]  I went through the alcohol highway safety classes, which I had to pay for out of my own pocket.
[00:36:56.434 --> 00:36:58.795]  I paid the $1,200 and some odd dollar fine.
[00:36:58.815 --> 00:37:00.716]  I did the license suspension.
[00:37:03.377 --> 00:37:05.558]  Well, they're saying that I didn't pay off my fine in time.
[00:37:06.118 --> 00:37:09.380]  So I was technically on probation when I was pulled over again.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:09.480]  Sure.
[00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:15.963]  I had an illegal inspection stick from my vehicle.
[00:37:17.743 --> 00:37:23.486]  So the defense attorney that I had for that case told me to go ahead and plead guilty and the judge will put me on probation.
[00:37:24.184 --> 00:37:26.586]  I said, well, you know, I'm already on probation for this.
[00:37:27.546 --> 00:37:29.487]  At the time, it was a five-year-old DUI.
[00:37:29.507 --> 00:37:37.152]  He said, well, the judge knows that, and he'll just make your probation run concurrent for another year, and you'll have to pay a small fine.
[00:37:37.932 --> 00:37:47.598]  Well, my small fine was $225, plus $1,200 in court costs, and he didn't tell me that... Of course, you need a car to probably go to work so you can pay these fines.
[00:37:48.539 --> 00:37:53.062]  Exactly, and he didn't tell me that I would also lose my driver's license for two and a half years.
[00:37:54.548 --> 00:37:56.249]  He didn't tell you that when he told you to plead out.
[00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.811]  Yeah, he kind of left that part out.
[00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:01.452]  You had a public defender, I assume.
[00:38:02.152 --> 00:38:02.453]  Yes.
[00:38:02.473 --> 00:38:03.433]  Okay.
[00:38:03.953 --> 00:38:17.481]  Well, so now I had to go through the motions to file a... Because now PennDOT wants to suspend my license again for the same DUI that I had in 2000, since they're saying that I violated my probation by pleading guilty to this thing.
[00:38:18.021 --> 00:38:22.504]  So I appealed it to the Common Police Court in Allegheny County, and...
[00:38:24.834 --> 00:38:25.815]  I missed my hearing.
[00:38:27.095 --> 00:38:31.217]  I'd mismarked on the calendar the date of my hearing, and I missed it.
[00:38:31.237 --> 00:38:31.977]  They dismissed it.
[00:38:32.958 --> 00:38:37.340]  Then my only recourse was to pay more money to appeal to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.361]  I heard this story, okay, a million times.
[00:38:41.401 --> 00:38:42.862]  I've seen how this has happened.
[00:38:43.082 --> 00:38:44.342]  Where are you now with it, Joe?
[00:38:45.603 --> 00:38:49.064]  Well, where I am now is I have to file an appellate brief, which I can't find it.
[00:38:49.585 --> 00:38:50.525]  An attorney I've called...
[00:38:51.323 --> 00:38:52.724]  And I don't have money for an attorney.
[00:38:53.224 --> 00:38:55.725]  I called up these attorneys acting like I had money.
[00:38:56.305 --> 00:38:58.606]  And they're telling me, you know, I can't even take your money.
[00:38:58.626 --> 00:39:00.767]  It's going to cost you $2,000 for me to file this.
[00:39:00.847 --> 00:39:03.488]  Yeah, no, this is a racket, okay?
[00:39:03.588 --> 00:39:04.929]  And you've been caught in the middle of it.
[00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:09.691]  Now, a lot of our listeners are going to say, Joe, and you even admitted, you really kind of brought this on yourself.
[00:39:10.291 --> 00:39:14.973]  You dug your own hole, and now they're wanting you to lie in it, and it doesn't feel very good, of course.
[00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:36.963]  You know, we have seen this happen over and over and over again, and I can tell you, it is a spiraling downfall once you get caught for this DUI, and sometimes you never get out of it because you continually need to drive or need transport, and you keep getting yourself in worse and worse trouble and digging a bigger and bigger grave for yourself, and this is happening all over the country now.
[00:39:38.141 --> 00:39:53.788]  As far as advice, I don't know if you have the time to represent yourself pro se, but I would probably think that that's where you want to go at this point, and you would want to get some advice, most likely from either a constitutional lawyer or somebody who...
[00:39:55.089 --> 00:39:58.754]  Who you're going to have to pay a lot to to get you on the right track.
[00:39:58.914 --> 00:40:01.417]  And perhaps even be co-counsel with you.
[00:40:01.617 --> 00:40:13.913]  Never, folks, never use public defenders, especially young public defenders, because their whole goal in life, their ambition, is to go to the other side of the court and work for the state as a prosecutor.
[00:40:14.273 --> 00:40:31.341]  That's what they want, and of course from there they want to be expensive defense lawyers or politicians, so there is a natural chain and a ladder that these attorneys go through, and I'm not saying they all do it, but the majority of them do it, and I've got to tell you folks, never get a public defender, especially a young one.
[00:40:31.641 --> 00:40:39.064]  You have a problem with these people not wanting to offend or upset the opposition because they want to be part of the opposition.
[00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:48.886]  So I wish I could have told you that, Joe, before you started, and hopefully there's someone else out there who's listening to this, and maybe you'll think twice before you drive drunk.
[00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:54.913]  I don't know how I didn't get caught in my younger years, Joe, doing this, being stupid and young like most people.
[00:40:54.953 --> 00:41:01.060]  I think I was just lucky or a really good driver, but boy, I feel bad for you, Joe.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.281]  Hang in there, okay?
[00:41:02.918 --> 00:41:03.539]  Thanks, Jack.
[00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:04.640]  Hang in there.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:13.270]  Look into representing yourself in this, and you might just have to bite down and pay the piper on this and learn a very important lesson.
[00:41:14.673 --> 00:41:15.854]  Yeah, it appears that way.
[00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:20.075]  Anybody in any county, don't use a public defender system, just like Jack said.
[00:41:20.516 --> 00:41:22.677]  But especially not David Obera.
[00:41:22.957 --> 00:41:23.737]  That's all I'll say.
[00:41:24.097 --> 00:41:26.058]  Well, that was a good left jab.
[00:41:26.118 --> 00:41:27.399]  I appreciate that show.
[00:41:27.879 --> 00:41:29.540]  Let's go to Patrick.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.641]  And Patrick is somewhere in the United States.
[00:41:32.681 --> 00:41:33.821]  Patrick, thank you for joining us.
[00:41:33.841 --> 00:41:34.982]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:35.442 --> 00:41:36.703]  Yeah, go Ron Paul.
[00:41:36.743 --> 00:41:37.623]  Go, baby, go.
[00:41:37.703 --> 00:41:38.263]  That's right.
[00:41:39.444 --> 00:41:44.226]  I just wanted to say real quick about the Real ID Act.
[00:41:44.895 --> 00:41:45.456]  For next year?
[00:41:47.919 --> 00:41:59.455]  Something a lot of people don't realize is that everyone that has a cell phone is carrying around the same technology that the real ID will be carrying.
[00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:00.236]  Well, thanks for the warning.
[00:42:00.276 --> 00:42:01.077]  Do you have a cell phone?
[00:42:01.417 --> 00:42:01.838]  No, I don't.
[00:42:02.218 --> 00:42:02.539]  Me neither.
[00:42:03.331 --> 00:42:10.579]  And, you know, anyone out there that does, I just wanted to make them aware that, you know, they're already carrying essentially what the real ID is.
[00:42:11.039 --> 00:42:14.162]  Well, they're consolidating all of the technology as well, and it's...
[00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:22.883]  Pretty seductive to the younger generations out there who like to play video games on their phones and send pictures and take pictures.
[00:42:23.003 --> 00:42:33.127]  I don't think people are aware that the pictures you take, anything you do on a cell phone, by the way, allegedly is fair game for the authorities, okay?
[00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:37.968]  Because it's sent out on a wireless wave and they can intercept that at any time, place, or place.
[00:42:41.224 --> 00:42:45.866]  Central location, so really nothing is safe you ever say and do on the cell phone.
[00:42:46.526 --> 00:42:56.571]  People don't really, I don't think, realize, Patrick, they're taking pictures, incriminating themselves, and sending them through the cell phone, which can end up in some database somewhere.
[00:42:56.611 --> 00:43:02.473]  But I think maybe what you're alluding to is the tracker technology, the listening devices.
[00:43:02.553 --> 00:43:05.755]  In fact, we've talked to many experts about cell phones, and they said, Jack,
[00:43:06.556 --> 00:43:07.116]  Yeah, me too.
[00:43:07.136 --> 00:43:08.537]  And, you know, it's the packet technology, and...
[00:43:26.255 --> 00:43:27.496]  Seductive, isn't it, Patrick?
[00:43:27.516 --> 00:43:27.736]  Correct.
[00:43:27.816 --> 00:43:29.638]  All these kids want the technology.
[00:43:29.678 --> 00:43:39.625]  They want all this stuff, man, and the blackberries and the jackberries and the raspberries and the blueberries, and they don't realize that everything they're doing is being database.
[00:43:39.865 --> 00:43:40.746]  It's a big scam.
[00:43:41.046 --> 00:43:43.088]  It really is, and people don't realize that.
[00:43:43.628 --> 00:43:48.271]  Yeah, you got clubs, man, you can't get in, or you get the VIP treatment if you scan your microchip.
[00:43:48.332 --> 00:43:49.272]  I mean, the kids love it.
[00:43:49.632 --> 00:43:50.173]  Absolutely.
[00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:51.982]  All right, is that it, Patrick?
[00:43:52.002 --> 00:43:52.723]  That's it, brother.
[00:43:52.803 --> 00:43:53.423]  In Bama!
[00:43:53.924 --> 00:43:55.085]  All right, man, thanks for the call.
[00:43:55.105 --> 00:43:56.907]  Let's go to Dean in Canada.
[00:43:56.947 --> 00:43:58.008]  Dean, thank you for calling.
[00:43:58.028 --> 00:43:59.069]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:43:59.409 --> 00:44:00.130]  Oh, good afternoon.
[00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:01.051]  Good afternoon.
[00:44:01.711 --> 00:44:04.834]  And greetings to the world from behind enemy lines and British occupation.
[00:44:04.874 --> 00:44:07.957]  Greetings, fellow thought criminals and enemies of the state.
[00:44:08.017 --> 00:44:08.378]  Go ahead, Dean.
[00:44:10.261 --> 00:44:14.022]  Well, I just wanted to say welcome back once again to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:14.903 --> 00:44:16.683]  Jack, it's refreshing to hear you.
[00:44:16.723 --> 00:44:21.145]  I don't get the Internet, so anytime I can hear you, hey, I'm going to crank that radio.
[00:44:21.405 --> 00:44:21.685]  Okay.
[00:44:22.125 --> 00:44:26.527]  And what you mentioned about the military-industrial complex, it is no different here.
[00:44:26.547 --> 00:44:35.710]  As a matter of fact, the whole system being corporate in nature here is run directly from the Crown of England, so it's not a wonder we're going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:39.111]  And so it means I don't discourse the point.
[00:44:40.946 --> 00:45:05.232]  Now more than ever, we have to look out for each other at the grassroots level and crank up whatever efforts we've got to re-educate, motivate, and to... We could pick up our muskets and try to fight them, but I don't know in 2007 how effective that's going to be, though I guess we see the insurgents in the Middle East as being at least somewhat effective.
[00:45:05.532 --> 00:45:07.573]  But yeah, we need to educate people.
[00:45:08.195 --> 00:45:10.456]  And, well, one thing I've found are the two things.
[00:45:10.496 --> 00:45:21.060]  Well, education is the key for most people, regardless of whether you're urban or rural, because most of us here in Canada are as intelligent as we are and as great a capacity for learning as we have.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:26.622]  We are as ignorant as your average rock in a lot of ways regarding our rights and liberties.
[00:45:27.322 --> 00:45:35.926]  And I thank the good Lord for what I've been blessed with in terms of statute law, that after handing it out only a handful of times, less than a handful of times,
[00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:43.834]  I've not been pulled over once in the last three years.
[00:45:43.854 --> 00:45:47.736]  They'd rather go pick on someone easier, I guess, Dean.
[00:45:48.277 --> 00:45:48.877]  Exactly.
[00:45:50.378 --> 00:46:01.124]  To that end as well, because we have so many other things to protect against, in terms of natural disasters, man-made or what have you, man-inspired, I should say.
[00:46:02.719 --> 00:46:06.762]  I'm putting together a preparedness expo in Tilbury, my little hometown in Ontario.
[00:46:06.782 --> 00:46:07.623]  It's near Windsor.
[00:46:08.584 --> 00:46:11.386]  And I think it's going to be a wonderful thing.
[00:46:11.446 --> 00:46:14.088]  Less than a month in trying to put things together.
[00:46:15.269 --> 00:46:19.873]  I've already got a few, from what I understand, a few people who actually want to give me a hand in putting it together.
[00:46:20.373 --> 00:46:25.477]  And bit by bit, there are people coming out of the woodwork to say, hey, I'm with you on that.
[00:46:25.557 --> 00:46:27.098]  And I think it's a wonderful thing.
[00:46:27.158 --> 00:46:29.280]  And Canada, you don't have to be afraid of anything.
[00:46:29.884 --> 00:46:32.085]  Yeah, we've been couched for a very long time.
[00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:38.007]  We've been indoctrinated, psychologically neutered, I call it, to say, oh, government, please give me a handout.
[00:46:38.047 --> 00:46:38.707]  Please help me out.
[00:46:38.748 --> 00:46:39.348]  Please help me out.
[00:46:39.388 --> 00:46:39.968]  To hell with them.
[00:46:40.168 --> 00:46:41.509]  Pardon the language, but to hell with them.
[00:46:41.989 --> 00:46:44.690]  What have they done for us that they didn't ask for something later on?
[00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:45.870]  Well, let's ask that question.
[00:46:48.781 --> 00:46:50.162]  We've done this on our program.
[00:46:50.182 --> 00:46:56.284]  We've tried to open up the phone lines and get people to name one government program that's ever worked for you.
[00:46:56.984 --> 00:46:57.825]  And guess what?
[00:46:57.925 --> 00:46:58.285]  Crickets.
[00:46:58.345 --> 00:47:00.706]  No one can think of anything to call in on.
[00:47:01.126 --> 00:47:08.349]  And we've also said, have you ever been in a position where you've needed the government's help and they've come to help you?
[00:47:08.449 --> 00:47:10.430]  I've got to tell you, I never have.
[00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:15.212]  And if I ever had been in a position to need the government's help, I was punished.
[00:47:15.652 --> 00:47:16.672]  For asking for it.
[00:47:17.193 --> 00:47:23.835]  So that really taught me a few very valuable lessons that we as individuals and we as communities have to help each other.
[00:47:23.875 --> 00:47:31.157]  And this is exactly what they're drumming out of America, I assume Canada, certainly Europe and at points around the world.
[00:47:32.053 --> 00:47:34.935]  They're getting us so that we can't depend on each other.
[00:47:34.955 --> 00:47:36.355]  We're all suspicious of each other.
[00:47:37.496 --> 00:47:42.998]  Our neighbors could be terrorists or our neighbors could be criminals or drug dealers or whatever the case may be.
[00:47:43.038 --> 00:47:44.439]  We don't trust our neighbors anymore.
[00:47:45.039 --> 00:47:49.241]  We don't go to the churches because they're 501c3.
[00:47:49.281 --> 00:47:54.644]  Now we're going to Walmart centers for handouts in the event of an emergency.
[00:47:54.764 --> 00:47:56.825]  This is really the point.
[00:47:57.125 --> 00:47:57.845]  I'm going to go back.
[00:47:58.026 --> 00:47:59.826]  Let me keep you on the line if I could, Dean.
[00:47:59.886 --> 00:48:00.787]  I'm going to go back to
[00:48:01.567 --> 00:48:05.010]  What Joe was talking about relating to his DUI.
[00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:13.797]  I mean, look, there is a problem, in a sense, with setting the legal alcohol limit so low, but that is to suck you and get you into the system.
[00:48:13.817 --> 00:48:17.160]  To get you into the system any possible way they can.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:24.184]  There was a day, and I love, you want to look how your liberties have been taken away from you, just analyze driving.
[00:48:24.364 --> 00:48:39.754]  I often use this example, Dean, and I think it's a good one, because if we analyze the laws pertaining to driving an automobile, to transporting yourself from point A to point B over the many decades, we will really see just how far the government has gone.
[00:48:39.774 --> 00:48:46.859]  And there was a time when you got pulled over in your truck, you had a shotgun, probably unregistered or unlicensed, in your back window.
[00:48:47.479 --> 00:48:48.300]  And at one time, that itself...
[00:49:15.521 --> 00:49:15.681]  Right.
[00:49:15.701 --> 00:49:15.841]  Right.
[00:49:15.861 --> 00:49:15.982]  Right.
[00:49:38.658 --> 00:49:45.282]  Well, it is the proverbial frog boiling in the pot with incrementalism and Fabian Socialism.
[00:49:45.322 --> 00:49:49.324]  We just don't see it around us until it's too late and it's all added up.
[00:49:49.745 --> 00:49:54.828]  And let's look at all the laws, the police state laws, for instance, that they've repealed over the years.
[00:49:55.068 --> 00:49:56.509]  Can anybody name one of those?
[00:49:57.469 --> 00:50:04.113]  Very few, but actually there's one here, the Emergency Powers Act, which is basically the War Measures Act, I'm sorry.
[00:50:04.133 --> 00:50:04.934]  Yeah.
[00:50:06.118 --> 00:50:12.380]  Actually, it was repealed, but they just replaced it with something called the Temporary Measures Act, which is exactly the same thing as the previous one.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.961]  So, no, they just replaced it with some other stuff that they could use at a later date.
[00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:17.522]  Well, that's what we better understand.
[00:50:17.542 --> 00:50:25.885]  I'm sure, you know, a lot of people listen to the politicians say that this is our temporary measures and that we are in a time of danger and we need to protect you and keep you safe.
[00:50:26.045 --> 00:50:29.526]  And, okay, and we'll put a sunset law to this.
[00:50:29.566 --> 00:50:33.067]  Well, we saw what happened with the Patriot Act here in the United States with the sunset laws.
[00:50:33.587 --> 00:50:35.008]  And can I give out my email address?
[00:50:35.088 --> 00:50:35.448]  Quickly.
[00:50:36.269 --> 00:50:45.916]  CanadaOurCountryAtHotmail.com CanadaOurCountryAtHotmail.com Rounding up those Canadians everywhere to fight for freedom.
[00:50:45.936 --> 00:50:46.817]  Thanks for the call, Dean.
[00:50:46.837 --> 00:50:47.377]  We'll come back.
[00:50:47.417 --> 00:50:48.938]  We'll take more calls right after this break.
[00:50:49.178 --> 00:50:50.499]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:50.739 --> 00:50:52.541]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:50:52.581 --> 00:50:54.302]  This is the Genesis Communications Network.
[00:51:03.977 --> 00:51:07.140]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.442]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:09.802 --> 00:51:17.468]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.149 --> 00:51:25.214]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.594 --> 00:51:28.557]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:28.897 --> 00:51:31.239]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:31.679 --> 00:51:32.500]  NSA spies.

[00:52:01.038 --> 00:52:04.600]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.160]  are located?
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.742]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:08.962 --> 00:52:13.684]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:52:13.965 --> 00:52:18.947]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:52:19.147 --> 00:52:19.807]  We're good to go.
[00:52:37.756 --> 00:52:39.898]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.

[00:53:39.502 --> 00:53:39.942]  We're good to go.
[00:53:39.962 --> 00:53:40.643]  We're good to go.
[00:54:08.834 --> 00:54:11.115]  We're good to go.
[00:54:28.909 --> 00:54:31.632]  Oh, this is not America.
[00:54:49.543 --> 00:54:53.744]  On some of the work that Ron Paul has been putting out, including his bid for president in 2008.
[00:54:54.685 --> 00:55:02.167]  You can talk about the anniversary here today of the Eisenhower speech warning us against the military-industrial complex.
[00:55:03.127 --> 00:55:09.469]  We have, with Deadline Live and JackBlood.com, done just a ton of work on this subject.
[00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:17.012]  You can pretty much call me the tick on the Carlisle Group rear end.
[00:55:17.911 --> 00:55:30.160]  So to speak, and I know that's a glorious way to explain what I do, but I know it doesn't make a huge difference to the Carlisle Group, but maybe it will if we continue to get the word out about this ex-presidents club.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:36.605]  We've been following their acquisitions, we've been following their legal troubles, we've been following them as they've been Pac-Manning.
[00:55:38.046 --> 00:55:40.107]  The media industrial complex.
[00:55:40.227 --> 00:56:05.521]  I mean, you know, since we're talking about the list of industrial complexes out there, the security industrial complex has now become potentially as big as the military industrial complex, the entertainment industrial complex, a part of the triad here with these behemoth companies, Pac-Man-ing groups like Clear Channel, the Chicago Tribune, the San Jose Mercury Times, where...
[00:56:07.157 --> 00:56:10.138]  You know, many great news stories had been reported in the past.
[00:56:10.158 --> 00:56:12.859]  It's a way, of course, to control all public opinion.
[00:56:13.119 --> 00:56:19.002]  This certainly goes back to the CIA program Mockingbird, which was first instituted back in the early 1960s.
[00:56:20.969 --> 00:56:39.678]  In order to control all public opinion, I'm sure it has its inroads into the Tavistock Institute and the usual suspects like the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the multitude of think tanks out there working as matrix moles for the neo-pharaohs that pull the strings.
[00:56:40.188 --> 00:56:49.131]  But you're more welcome to comment on the military-industrial complex, Ron Paul, or even this token anniversary of the first Gulf War.
[00:56:49.191 --> 00:56:50.972]  And in fact, maybe you disagree.
[00:56:51.973 --> 00:57:00.816]  People I talk to, military experts, veterans who fought in these wars, say that we have been fighting there continuously, one way or another now, for over 16 years.
[00:57:01.656 --> 00:57:04.397]  And that is the longest war in history.
[00:57:04.417 --> 00:57:04.477]  1-800-259-9231
[00:57:09.945 --> 00:57:11.286]  I don't even know, do we have time?
[00:57:11.326 --> 00:57:17.531]  Let's try to go to Ansure in Indy, and if we don't have time, we'll hold you over.
[00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:19.992]  Ansure, I believe it is, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:20.333 --> 00:57:21.133]  That's correct.
[00:57:21.373 --> 00:57:25.076]  You're probably one of few that can pronounce my name correctly, but you're doing a good job, Jack.
[00:57:25.316 --> 00:57:25.956]  Thanks, I try.
[00:57:26.717 --> 00:57:34.923]  I just thought I'd call and share a previous update that I received in the mail for my DWI charge I got about a couple of years ago.
[00:57:37.299 --> 00:57:46.462]  As much as I'm trying to dig myself out of a big, huge hole, I've accepted personal responsibility and accountability for my actions.
[00:57:47.442 --> 00:58:03.048]  I received in the mail basically quotes as, as required by Indiana State Criminal Code 13-6-1, you are required to submit a DNA sample to the state of Indiana if my felony conviction was after July 1st, 2005.
[00:58:03.828 --> 00:58:05.308]  Could you give me a little heads up?
[00:58:05.449 --> 00:58:06.669]  What the hell are they talking about?
[00:58:07.048 --> 00:58:11.951]  Well, they're creating national DNA databases, not just in this country, but all around the world.
[00:58:13.052 --> 00:58:16.694]  So they want everyone's DNA, and they're using this as a pretext to get yours.
[00:58:17.135 --> 00:58:19.396]  Let me ask you, you got caught for a DUI.
[00:58:19.416 --> 00:58:20.237]  Did you get in an accident?
[00:58:20.917 --> 00:58:21.137]  No.
[00:58:21.478 --> 00:58:23.799]  Just pulled you over and caught you.
[00:58:23.999 --> 00:58:24.239]  Yes.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:27.441]  We stay on the line, and we'll talk a little bit about this on the other side.
[00:58:27.461 --> 00:58:29.383]  We're going to come back in 70 seconds, folks.
[00:58:29.743 --> 00:58:32.525]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show coming up right after this.
[00:58:32.785 --> 00:58:34.726]  Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:35.106 --> 00:58:35.847]  Please stay tuned.
[00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:44.651]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at gsanlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:44.891 --> 00:58:45.291]  Big Brother.
[00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:45.791]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:45.811 --> 00:58:46.271]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:46.291 --> 00:58:46.831]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.308 --> 00:59:04.189]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.209 --> 00:59:08.591]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.051 --> 00:59:14.974]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.875 --> 00:59:22.357]  Live from Austin, Texas, Jack Blood, your radio gun, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:59:22.758 --> 00:59:24.619]  Bob Dacey tomorrow and the next day.
[00:59:25.739 --> 00:59:27.220]  Your Alex Jones.
[00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:33.305]  Underdog will join us all this Monday in taking a well-needed rest.
[00:59:33.345 --> 00:59:34.946]  I appreciate everybody staying tuned.
[00:59:36.206 --> 00:59:44.289]  It's interesting that a lot of this DNA database, this police state action as it pertains to driving is coming up quite a bit on this show.
[00:59:45.683 --> 00:59:48.084]  It's synergy, I can say.
[00:59:48.124 --> 00:59:52.526]  We are going to run a story on scanning your license plates.
[00:59:52.586 --> 00:59:57.688]  That is, of course, offending your Fifth Amendment right to incriminate yourself.
[00:59:57.708 --> 01:00:00.689]  So they can see if they have somebody who's in a database.
[01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.870]  We're good to go.
[01:00:17.598 --> 01:00:20.440]  Getting everybody in this DNA database.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.661]  And obviously it's extremely dangerous.
[01:00:23.761 --> 01:00:39.430]  Now look, I'm sure some of you out there are saying, Jack, if I'm a law-abiding citizen, why do I have to worry about being in the system and having my DNA on file and my fingerprints on file and my photo on file for face scanning technology?
[01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:41.671]  I'm not breaking any laws, but I think that...
[01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:49.987]  That the top criminal experts out there will tell you, I believe that an American breaks a law something like every 34 minutes.
[01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:52.094]  You know?
[01:00:52.594 --> 01:00:56.456]  Because there's so many laws that you can't even keep track of them all.
[01:00:56.516 --> 01:00:59.417]  And some of them seem, you know, like minutia.
[01:00:59.457 --> 01:01:00.777]  They seem non-important.
[01:01:00.817 --> 01:01:11.321]  But once you get into the system, and once you are oppressed by the system, it continually puts you in a place where you have to break more and more laws, and then you become public enemy number one.
[01:01:11.341 --> 01:01:19.003]  And let's not forget people like Brandon Mayfield, the professor in Oregon, who was charged to be part of the Madrid bombings.
[01:01:19.063 --> 01:01:20.844]  His entire career was ruined.
[01:01:21.484 --> 01:01:24.785]  He was lambasted into the newspapers and turned into a terrorist.
[01:01:24.825 --> 01:01:35.169]  Turns out, they had absolutely no real information, hooking him to the Madrid bombings, and he ended up settling out of court a couple of months ago for a large sum of cash, but not before his life was ruined.
[01:01:35.209 --> 01:01:37.110]  He was a law-abiding citizen.
[01:01:38.971 --> 01:01:45.013]  Unlike Ansher in Indy, who was drinking and driving, I gotta tell ya,
[01:01:45.948 --> 01:01:59.212]  I don't think it's good to drink and drive, and sure, I would recommend against it on every level, but at the same time, if you're not hurting anyone, why are they even inquiring to whether you've been drinking or not?
[01:01:59.232 --> 01:02:00.592]  Were you swerving on the road?
[01:02:00.632 --> 01:02:04.974]  I mean, what indication did you give to get pulled over in order to be charged with this?
[01:02:05.274 --> 01:02:11.556]  I was crossing the double line, but since then, I gave it all up.
[01:02:11.636 --> 01:02:12.736]  I sold my truck.
[01:02:12.976 --> 01:02:14.357]  I no longer have to pay gas
[01:02:16.437 --> 01:02:18.859]  Oil, insurance, maintenance, nothing.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.240]  I'm through with it.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.703]  Trying to dig myself out of a hole, as I said, it's they want to pull you back in.
[01:02:26.544 --> 01:02:27.885]  They won't let you go for nothing.
[01:02:29.486 --> 01:02:31.427]  Well, are you going to submit your DNA?
[01:02:33.508 --> 01:02:43.855]  Well, I have another probation appointment before then, and if my questions aren't answered, it's scary to think that I wouldn't, but I
[01:02:45.558 --> 01:02:47.702]  I just don't like what's going on.
[01:02:48.684 --> 01:02:54.014]  I'm not sure what level you might have of being an offender not to do this.
[01:02:54.114 --> 01:02:57.320]  I can only say, if it were me, I would resist.
[01:02:57.898 --> 01:03:05.104]  Here it says, failure to participate and provide a DNA sample is against Indiana state law and further legal action will be taken.
[01:03:05.484 --> 01:03:09.207]  Okay, well I'm not sure if it is and that's something that you're going to need to check out.
[01:03:09.227 --> 01:03:12.590]  A lot of times they will say that it is and it really isn't.
[01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:14.311]  They're just trying to intimidate you.
[01:03:14.671 --> 01:03:23.138]  I would assume that on some level this would be more than an invasion of privacy but I mean look, you've got to decide if you're going to take a stand on this.
[01:03:23.639 --> 01:03:23.959]  Okay?
[01:03:23.999 --> 01:03:26.561]  As soon as I popped it open the first thing that came to my mind is
[01:03:27.153 --> 01:03:31.456]  Am I being investigated about a murder or a rape that I know I didn't commit?
[01:03:32.897 --> 01:03:35.078]  Well, look, like I said, you've got to decide.
[01:03:35.138 --> 01:03:39.220]  If this is your line in the sand and you want to stand up to this, personally, I would.
[01:03:39.921 --> 01:03:44.624]  But it's going to be a long haul, and you've got to be prepared for that, okay?
[01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:49.527]  I'll try to dig some information up for you on the program today, and we'll try to get it out for you, okay?
[01:03:49.547 --> 01:03:50.207]  I appreciate the call.
[01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:51.208]  We'll come right back after this.
[01:03:55.672 --> 01:03:58.834]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.175 --> 01:04:01.116]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:01.476 --> 01:04:09.141]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.822 --> 01:04:16.867]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.267 --> 01:04:20.229]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:22.911]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:23.331 --> 01:04:24.172]  NSA spies.
[01:04:24.648 --> 01:04:28.690]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:04:28.991 --> 01:04:32.493]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists.
[01:04:32.973 --> 01:04:34.854]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.214 --> 01:04:39.137]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.945 --> 01:04:54.986]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:55.306 --> 01:04:58.088]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:58.348 --> 01:05:02.511]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:02.952 --> 01:05:03.772]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.092 --> 01:05:08.656]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.136 --> 01:05:11.256]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:11.757 --> 01:05:26.460]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:33.601]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:33.921 --> 01:05:37.062]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:05:38.442 --> 01:05:40.023]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:58.202]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:58.442 --> 01:06:00.204]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:00.464 --> 01:06:06.749]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:13.174]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:13.414 --> 01:06:19.439]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:19.719 --> 01:06:26.127]  With no side effects, the 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:06:26.287 --> 01:06:29.811]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:06:30.132 --> 01:06:33.816]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:06:34.016 --> 01:06:36.559]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.741]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:38.101 --> 01:06:39.862]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:39.902 --> 01:06:41.243]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:10.871]  Okay, we are going to go to all your calls, so please stay aboard.
[01:07:11.031 --> 01:07:13.352]  Again, the phone number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:15.172 --> 01:07:24.435]  We are standing by for Congressman Ron Paul, so don't be surprised if we have to drop everything we're doing in order to get to Congressman Paul.
[01:07:24.475 --> 01:07:29.316]  But we will continue on with the program, and it's interesting how these shows kind of take on a life of their own.
[01:07:29.356 --> 01:07:31.617]  You spend hours preparing a program, and then you see...
[01:07:32.077 --> 01:07:45.383]  You know, what people want to talk about, and I think that's really important, you know, what you want to talk about, what you want to put on the record, and we've had a number of calls regarding, you know, the police state and driving, and, you know, I think it's a worthy topic to discuss.
[01:07:45.763 --> 01:07:55.067]  In fact, what we're going to do here in a second is discuss automatic scanning of every license plate for crime and for terrorism.
[01:07:55.848 --> 01:08:02.414]  You know, regarding the DNA action that Ensure called in from Indiana, I mean, here's the problem.
[01:08:02.475 --> 01:08:04.637]  And Bush announced this about three years ago.
[01:08:04.677 --> 01:08:11.384]  In fact, he said he was going to spend $1 billion in five years to create this national DNA database.
[01:08:11.464 --> 01:08:13.987]  And there, of course, are many problems with this.
[01:08:14.047 --> 01:08:15.909]  And right now, the parameter is set...
[01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:16.932]  We're good to go.
[01:08:16.952 --> 01:08:17.512]  We're good to go.
[01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:37.092]  When you've committed a crime.
[01:08:37.312 --> 01:08:45.396]  This also rides down the old slippery slope when now they're trying to get your DNA if you've even been arrested and not convicted of a crime.
[01:08:45.416 --> 01:08:53.300]  And they are merely or genuinely here trying to get your children into the database so that they have everybody in a database.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:09:01.885]  And privacy experts, including even people at the ACLU, have said that, look, this is dangerous.
[01:09:02.045 --> 01:09:03.226]  In fact, one
[01:09:03.846 --> 01:09:17.117]  I can't remember who said it from the ACLU, and how could I ever remember his name, but it's just a matter of time before the government starts playing around with your DNA and figuring out ways, of course, to continue to control you.
[01:09:17.977 --> 01:09:26.744]  Now, regarding the subject of do you have to give your DNA, obviously you don't if you're not committed of a crime, and that is convicted.
[01:09:27.305 --> 01:09:28.626]  You have to be convicted of a crime.
[01:09:29.822 --> 01:09:44.186]  Though I have to tell you, and I don't know a lot about this, just primarily because I can't remember everything, partially, and because I'm not a criminal, so I haven't had the experience, so to speak.
[01:09:44.286 --> 01:09:47.527]  But I would fight it, personally.
[01:09:47.587 --> 01:09:55.329]  I would do everything in my power to not allow my DNA in the database or the DNA of my children or my family or anybody I care about.
[01:09:55.349 --> 01:09:56.950]  I think that's where I would draw the line.
[01:09:58.081 --> 01:10:18.661]  So, you, like a couple of the callers today, have your homework cut out for you, and I assume that you can pick the brains of people at the ACLU who are already kind of way ahead of us on this, but look, do your homework, do some searching, and who knows, you could end up being the number one activist against this, and...
[01:10:19.876 --> 01:10:22.858]  And we can all tap into your work, I think.
[01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.160]  But there's a lot to talk about on this DNA thing.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.823]  I could actually read you an entire story about it, or several stories.
[01:10:28.883 --> 01:10:34.707]  It is on the fast track, of course, as usual, in the United Kingdom and Canada.
[01:10:35.488 --> 01:10:37.870]  As our caller mentioned earlier, Little Britain.
[01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:43.993]  And certainly here in the United States now, it has been a huge measure.
[01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:54.219]  And this is really, I think, the reason why we have these rinky-dink little crimes to get you sucked into the system so they can get you database, so they can get your DNA in the system.
[01:10:54.819 --> 01:10:56.781]  And I don't know what to tell you.
[01:10:56.821 --> 01:10:58.622]  I mean, you know, don't get arrested.
[01:10:59.162 --> 01:11:05.366]  You know, I'd actually like people to go out and get arrested doing civil disobedient acts, much like Cindy Sheehan does.
[01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:06.987]  I think it calls attention to the cause.
[01:11:07.665 --> 01:11:12.690]  So I admire people that do that, so I'm not going to say, don't get arrested.
[01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:18.276]  I'm going to say, stand up for what you believe in, and if I'm you, I don't go along with it.
[01:11:18.457 --> 01:11:19.358]  I refuse.
[01:11:20.038 --> 01:11:21.860]  They'll have to strap me down to take it.
[01:11:23.902 --> 01:11:25.824]  You can lock me in jail, and I just won't do it.
[01:11:25.864 --> 01:11:27.186]  I'll stay there until I have to.
[01:11:28.619 --> 01:11:32.462]  Automatic scanning of every license plate for crime and terrorism.
[01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:36.905]  I believe we have time to play this clip right now, and then we'll talk about it, and then we'll go to your calls as well.
[01:11:36.945 --> 01:11:38.947]  I think this fits in rather nicely.
[01:11:39.027 --> 01:11:40.328]  John, go ahead and roll that clip.
[01:11:40.928 --> 01:11:49.755]  The Long Beach Police Department has recently acquired new technology that allows officers to automatically read license plates and compare them to wanted vehicle databases.
[01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:53.898]  This is called ALPR, or Automated License Plate Recognition.
[01:11:54.759 --> 01:12:01.121]  Each ALPR vehicle has three cameras mounted on the light bar that can read license plates in all weather and in complete darkness.
[01:12:01.822 --> 01:12:05.123]  Each camera contains both the color overview and infrared camera.
[01:12:05.563 --> 01:12:08.484]  The system compares plates to four databases at this time.
[01:12:08.904 --> 01:12:16.267]  We are searching for wanted felony vehicles, local wanted vehicles, stolen vehicles, and vehicles with lost or stolen license plates.
[01:12:16.807 --> 01:12:21.649]  If the system finds a match in a database, the officer will be alerted both visually and audibly.
[01:12:23.911 --> 01:12:28.892]  Now we want to get all the new information, all the stolen vehicles that are out in the field.
[01:12:29.232 --> 01:12:31.332]  So what we're going to do is we're just going to hit begin shift.
[01:12:31.932 --> 01:12:33.173]  The process is wireless.
[01:12:34.933 --> 01:12:38.794]  It's now uploading all the databases, and it's done.
[01:12:39.694 --> 01:12:51.396]  What we're seeing is typically between 3,000 and 4,000 plates a shift being read and compared to the database, opposed to the old way, which is just manually inputting plates in the computer.
[01:12:52.378 --> 01:12:54.839]  The quickest guy, I think we saw 150, 200 a shift.
[01:12:54.879 --> 01:13:02.482]  So you're comparing a lot of information that you normally just would have driven right by to databases.
[01:13:04.683 --> 01:13:06.363]  So basically, you're just cruising down the lot.
[01:13:06.403 --> 01:13:11.125]  You can be going 50 miles an hour, and it will read them.
[01:13:12.246 --> 01:13:18.208]  Obviously, the slower you go, the better, but it's pretty efficient.
[01:13:20.109 --> 01:13:20.409]  I'm going 80...
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:28.403]  It's catching the cars going the opposite direction that I'm sure are going at least 80.
[01:13:31.986 --> 01:13:38.792]  And if you're driving along, and the computer actually sees the car,
[01:13:43.617 --> 01:13:44.217]  You'll get a hit.
[01:13:44.377 --> 01:13:48.998]  And it takes about one second from when the camera sees it to when it displays it on the screen.
[01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:53.859]  But it automatically pops up so you don't have to worry about fumbling with the computer and all that kind of stuff.
[01:13:54.239 --> 01:13:56.979]  And to verify it, obviously you just go back to your Tiburon screen.
[01:13:57.879 --> 01:14:06.181]  If something happens and you're on a call and say a 211 goes out, you have the ability to manually input plates into the system as well.
[01:14:07.601 --> 01:14:10.022]  To do that, what you'll do is you'll just hit manual plate
[01:14:10.675 --> 01:14:11.075]  Entry?
[01:14:12.296 --> 01:14:13.536]  Let's do this truck up here.
[01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:17.297]  Call goes out.
[01:14:20.398 --> 01:14:25.460]  It's 7 Charles 65885, right?
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.601]  Hit play.
[01:14:28.821 --> 01:14:30.102]  No match in database.
[01:14:30.122 --> 01:14:31.462]  There's no match in the system.
[01:14:31.923 --> 01:14:32.983]  We're just going to make a note.
[01:14:33.183 --> 01:14:37.044]  It's just going to be a test, but you can put whatever you wanted into there.
[01:14:37.064 --> 01:14:38.185]  Hit save.
[01:14:38.245 --> 01:14:38.545]  Saved.
[01:14:39.361 --> 01:14:49.511]  Now, the next time you see it... It's gonna turn off, but... As soon as it sees the plate, your arm will go off.
[01:14:50.132 --> 01:14:58.440]  And it gives you all the information that you inputted, gives you a picture of the car, the plate as it saw it, and then the plate as it interpreted it to be.
[01:14:59.406 --> 01:15:03.788]  The machine will keep every single read that you've collected until you end shift.
[01:15:03.888 --> 01:15:13.211]  Just hit the next button, and you can actually toggle through every single plate that you read.
[01:15:13.891 --> 01:15:23.115]  What's neat, this information is downloaded or uploaded to the server, or we can actually use it for data mining.
[01:15:23.555 --> 01:15:26.276]  So if you want to know, was this plate for...
[01:15:27.068 --> 01:15:31.931]  Robert David Nora 096 seen in the city of Long Beach by one of our license plate readers.
[01:15:31.971 --> 01:15:39.977]  You can query the plate, and every single time it's been seen that we still have in the database, it'll bring up a picture and information with a timestamp.
[01:15:40.037 --> 01:15:46.581]  It's not showing here, but we have a timestamp and a GPS coordinate, and you can map the location of the vehicle.
[01:15:46.621 --> 01:15:54.427]  So if you have a murder vehicle, a 187 vehicle with a plate that you have, you could query the system to see where in the past it's been seen.
[01:15:56.522 --> 01:15:57.183]  Alright, folks.
[01:15:57.865 --> 01:16:00.370]  Here's Amendment 5 from your Bill of Rights.
[01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:06.282]  No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a
[01:16:07.422 --> 01:16:35.013]  Presentment or indictment of a grand jury except in cases arising in land or naval forces or in the militia, whatever that is today, when the actual service in time of war or public danger, nor shall any person be subject for the same offense but to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb, that's double jeopardy, nor shall he be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,
[01:16:35.879 --> 01:16:37.880]  You are largely incriminating yourself.
[01:16:59.818 --> 01:17:00.898]  Without due cause.
[01:17:00.958 --> 01:17:02.379]  In other words, you're doing nothing.
[01:17:02.399 --> 01:17:08.442]  You're driving down the road, minding your own business, allegedly obeying the laws, and you're singled out.
[01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:12.323]  And, of course, we've seen how these databases have worked in the past.
[01:17:12.483 --> 01:17:13.684]  They make a lot of mistakes.
[01:17:14.284 --> 01:17:24.008]  A lot of people are going to be hauled in on this because they, for some reason or another, got on the record as being a child molester or, God forbid, a drunken driver in the past.
[01:17:25.212 --> 01:17:27.874]  This will be the measure in order to pull you over.
[01:17:27.934 --> 01:17:29.555]  Well, I'm sorry, sir.
[01:17:29.595 --> 01:17:30.335]  What did I do wrong?
[01:17:30.355 --> 01:17:34.297]  Oh, well, your license plate matched that of a criminal.
[01:17:34.758 --> 01:17:36.039]  And we want to search your car.
[01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:37.219]  I mean, there we go.
[01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:42.002]  Down the long spiral of police injustice.
[01:17:42.322 --> 01:17:43.643]  The Injustice Department.
[01:17:45.853 --> 01:17:54.140]  A reader actually wrote, and I have an idea who this might be, I think that really said it very succinctly, did a great job talking about this.
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.522]  Once again, a predatory police state society is being created.
[01:17:58.263 --> 01:18:00.124]  Police policing everyone now?
[01:18:01.005 --> 01:18:02.927]  Searching everyone will be the norm?
[01:18:03.307 --> 01:18:04.548]  What's the purpose for this?
[01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:09.612]  Mega income generation from catching everyone who has expired tags or plates?
[01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:15.350]  Of course they will be highlighting the car involved in the robbery, etc.
[01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:18.551]  to get the public to support their own enslavement.
[01:18:19.012 --> 01:18:25.716]  As the officer says in the short video, ALPR is going to revolutionize the way we police in North America.
[01:18:26.276 --> 01:18:28.737]  Notice he didn't say the United States, but North America.
[01:18:28.757 --> 01:18:36.182]  Yes, my friends, the North American Union where the Constitution will be shredded for a treaty which is illegal and the American people don't have a clue.
[01:18:36.722 --> 01:18:37.643]  And he goes on to list...
[01:18:38.593 --> 01:18:41.717]  A number of things that have happened in the land of the free, the home of the slave.
[01:18:41.837 --> 01:18:42.337]  We'll come back.
[01:18:42.357 --> 01:18:43.539]  We'll go right to your calls after this.
[01:18:43.559 --> 01:18:44.720]  You can comment on this as well.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.181]  Still standing by for Ron Paul.
[01:18:46.202 --> 01:18:47.163]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.422]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:55.943 --> 01:20:02.507]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[01:20:03.248 --> 01:20:08.492]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[01:20:09.232 --> 01:20:20.981]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.
[01:20:21.781 --> 01:20:29.726]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:30.246 --> 01:20:31.967]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:32.107 --> 01:20:32.827]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:32.908 --> 01:20:33.528]  Call now.
[01:20:33.568 --> 01:20:39.892]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:54.574 --> 01:20:58.256]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:20:59.436 --> 01:21:04.259]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:21:04.479 --> 01:21:07.200]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.381]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:21:09.702 --> 01:21:14.304]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing potential profits.
[01:21:15.224 --> 01:21:22.428]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:21:23.473 --> 01:21:26.554]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:21:27.454 --> 01:21:32.156]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:21:33.136 --> 01:21:34.396]  Call for your copy today.
[01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:36.857]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:37.917 --> 01:21:43.759]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:21:44.459 --> 01:21:44.859]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.919 --> 01:21:45.119]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.239 --> 01:21:57.020]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.221]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:22:01.481 --> 01:22:07.782]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:22:08.022 --> 01:22:12.403]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[01:22:12.603 --> 01:22:17.864]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.
[01:22:18.144 --> 01:22:20.346]  And of course, the new solar-powered generator.
[01:22:40.805 --> 01:22:41.365]  We're good to go.
[01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:12.340]  We'll go right back to the phones.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:12.580]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.744]  Feel free to call in and address what we're talking about on today's program.
[01:23:17.865 --> 01:23:20.007]  Shift the topics dramatically.
[01:23:20.047 --> 01:23:21.168]  Put something on the record.
[01:23:21.588 --> 01:23:23.670]  Appreciate everybody helping me out on the program today.
[01:23:23.690 --> 01:23:27.033]  I think between all of us, we can get through this together.
[01:23:28.112 --> 01:23:30.133]  Jack Blood sitting in for the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:30.693 --> 01:23:35.994]  Real quick, again, I need to remind you, all of the Alex Jones videos are now on DVD.
[01:23:36.274 --> 01:23:47.898]  There are tremendous specials carried over from the Christmas holiday season, New Year's, including different packages of Alex Jones videos and some of the videos carried at the InfoWars stores.
[01:23:48.258 --> 01:23:51.919]  And most importantly, this is something you definitely have to hear me on,
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.121]  We're good to go.
[01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:09.463]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:09.483 --> 01:24:12.384]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com.

[01:24:32.831 --> 01:24:34.051]  The clock is ticking.
[01:24:34.531 --> 01:24:35.912]  Any time now, they will end.
[01:24:36.332 --> 01:24:39.153]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:39.173 --> 01:24:43.596]  Again, the phone line to call into the program today, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:43.756 --> 01:24:48.678]  Rob is calling from Tennessee, who is with the Pilots for 9-11 Truth.
[01:24:48.718 --> 01:24:49.759]  Pilots for 9-11 Truth.
[01:24:50.099 --> 01:24:51.479]  Is it .org, Rob, or .com?
[01:24:51.499 --> 01:24:52.000]  I can't remember.
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:54.481]  .org, Pilots for 9-11 Truth.org.
[01:24:54.601 --> 01:25:01.364]  And you guys are a group of seasoned pilots who have flown commercial airliners who have been investigating 9-11 now for quite some time.
[01:25:02.064 --> 01:25:02.845]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:04.296 --> 01:25:05.716]  I don't want to take up too much of your time.
[01:25:05.756 --> 01:25:07.817]  I guess you've got Ron Paul calling in there.
[01:25:07.857 --> 01:25:08.837]  How about that guy, huh?
[01:25:09.057 --> 01:25:15.679]  Well, you are going to be a guest on my program today following this show in the second hour of our show, so people can find out a lot more about you.
[01:25:15.699 --> 01:25:18.560]  But just give people the simple rundown of what you guys have been working on.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:28.522]  Yeah, well, we received the flight data recorder information for American 77, the one that hit the Pentagon, through the Freedom of Information Act from the NTSB.
[01:25:29.617 --> 01:25:32.599]  And we've just released our first full documentary on it.
[01:25:32.639 --> 01:25:35.020]  You can find it on the site, pilots4911truth.org.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:50.949]  It came out pretty well, and it puts everything in perspective in a very understandable way, because the text on the site is kind of technical, but the video that we released, and you can also find it on Google Video,
[01:25:52.203 --> 01:26:01.270]  Would it be fair to say that your research tends to ask more questions than deliver answers for some of the questions we've already had, which I think is good.
[01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:05.833]  You guys are raising some new issues keeping the 9-11 truth movement alive.
[01:26:06.154 --> 01:26:07.334]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:08.115 --> 01:26:20.265]  As a matter of fact, it raises a lot of questions, and we have a recorded call to the National Transportation Safety Board in the film, and also on the DVD as an extra we have...
[01:26:21.235 --> 01:26:26.741]  A call to the FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation, which I spoke to them directly as well.
[01:26:28.103 --> 01:26:33.729]  We have a few other actors with a flight data recorder expert on the DVD.
[01:26:35.569 --> 01:26:37.151]  It really puts things into perspective.
[01:26:37.291 --> 01:26:46.704]  What we do know is that the flight data recorder information that you guys got through Freedom of Information Act does not match the official story of Flight 77 and the Pentagon.
[01:26:46.744 --> 01:26:52.152]  And furthermore, you guys had one of your members come out, I believe his name was, was it Rob Harden?
[01:26:52.792 --> 01:26:57.134]  Robin Horden, former Boston Air Traffic Control.
[01:26:57.174 --> 01:27:10.218]  That's right, and he had quite a bit to say about the story that we heard regarding NORAD and what happened all day long on 9-11, and that was a gripping story, which I know you guys have at pilots4911truth.org.
[01:27:10.238 --> 01:27:12.478]  Yeah, that's covered in the film as well.
[01:27:12.959 --> 01:27:20.261]  We cover Hani Hanjour and what he supposedly had, what he reportedly had for training in the background.
[01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:24.372]  And what he had to go through, if he really did go through it, to get that.
[01:27:25.113 --> 01:27:29.836]  It doesn't look like he could have, based on testimony from flight school managers.
[01:27:29.876 --> 01:27:31.877]  We go over the NORAD response.
[01:27:32.537 --> 01:27:34.679]  The Robin Horton interview is in the film as well.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:45.546]  We really put it together nicely for people that do not fly airplanes, that are not pilots, that can really understand.
[01:27:45.606 --> 01:27:50.449]  And considering everything that we're going through today with the license plates and everything you were talking about before...
[01:27:51.235 --> 01:27:54.096]  All stemming from September 11th, so we really have to look into this stuff.
[01:27:54.156 --> 01:27:56.837]  I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but... Well, maybe not.
[01:27:56.877 --> 01:28:07.701]  I mean, we have a lot of new listeners always tuning into this program who are really passionate about this, want to learn as much as they can, and I think your organization is a great contribution to the cause.
[01:28:07.742 --> 01:28:08.142]  Thank you.
[01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:08.582]  Yours too.
[01:28:09.862 --> 01:28:10.683]  Well, I do what I can.
[01:28:10.743 --> 01:28:14.465]  I'm kind of a conduit to get your information out to the public.
[01:28:14.505 --> 01:28:20.807]  But you will be my guest in the second hour of Deadline Live today, also on this very network following the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:21.708 --> 01:28:22.788]  Appreciate you calling in, Rob.
[01:28:22.808 --> 01:28:23.749]  Look forward to speaking to you today.
[01:28:23.769 --> 01:28:25.290]  I hope everybody tunes into that and supports.
[01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:26.950]  Pilots for 911truth.org.
[01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.711]  Get that video.
[01:28:27.751 --> 01:28:28.611]  Thanks for the call, Rob.
[01:28:28.871 --> 01:28:31.152]  We'll come back with a coyote, Charles, Larry, and Tony.
[01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:32.233]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:32.253 --> 01:28:32.653]  Stay tuned.
[01:28:42.921 --> 01:28:43.841]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.322 --> 01:28:45.923]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.943 --> 01:28:49.645]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.887 --> 01:28:55.288]  Attention, attention everyone!
[01:28:55.388 --> 01:28:57.830]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:28:57.910 --> 01:29:02.613]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:29:03.254 --> 01:29:10.075]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse, or adding machine.
[01:29:10.616 --> 01:29:23.478]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:29:23.938 --> 01:29:27.919]  Wrist Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[01:29:28.379 --> 01:29:32.360]  Wrist Ease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and...
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:38.464]  Wrist Ease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[01:29:38.845 --> 01:29:41.847]  You can order Wrist Ease now at wristease.com.
[01:29:42.247 --> 01:29:48.852]  That's Wrist Ease, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, wristease.com.
[01:29:49.012 --> 01:29:51.734]  Once again, wristease.com.
[01:29:52.675 --> 01:29:54.416]  Shelly, you look awake.
[01:29:54.536 --> 01:29:55.637]  Why did you turn that down?
[01:29:55.657 --> 01:29:58.199]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[01:29:58.624 --> 01:30:01.545]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice.
[01:30:01.946 --> 01:30:03.186]  Well, what's the bed fan?
[01:30:03.366 --> 01:30:05.807]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[01:30:06.068 --> 01:30:07.288]  I think it's something like that.
[01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:12.711]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night, and you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[01:30:12.771 --> 01:30:14.592]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[01:30:14.692 --> 01:30:16.953]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[01:30:17.333 --> 01:30:17.953]  I guess you're right.
[01:30:18.333 --> 01:30:19.034]  Why don't we try it?
[01:30:19.194 --> 01:30:21.195]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[01:30:21.615 --> 01:30:25.997]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer, and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[01:30:26.277 --> 01:30:27.618]  I know where we can get some more information.
[01:30:28.086 --> 01:30:32.389]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[01:30:32.649 --> 01:30:35.931]  The bed fan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[01:30:36.171 --> 01:30:39.333]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[01:30:39.694 --> 01:30:40.554]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[01:30:40.794 --> 01:30:42.055]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[01:30:42.255 --> 01:30:43.536]  The bed fan is the answer.
[01:30:43.796 --> 01:30:47.138]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.

[01:30:53.735 --> 01:30:56.098]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:56.338 --> 01:30:58.380]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:05.648]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:31:05.848 --> 01:31:14.417]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:31:14.737 --> 01:31:19.419]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:31:19.559 --> 01:31:23.601]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[01:31:23.801 --> 01:31:26.242]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.

[01:31:40.367 --> 01:31:41.308]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at calbinpuresoap.com.
[01:31:41.348 --> 01:31:44.109]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:31:58.752 --> 01:32:01.293]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:32:01.333 --> 01:32:03.674]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[01:32:03.754 --> 01:32:06.995]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:32:07.015 --> 01:32:10.476]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John.
[01:32:12.157 --> 01:32:13.978]  Big John.
[01:32:14.918 --> 01:32:17.219]  Big John.
[01:32:17.759 --> 01:32:19.380]  Big bad John.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:21.701]  Big John.
[01:32:21.881 --> 01:32:22.801]  Note to self.
[01:32:24.393 --> 01:32:29.520]  Researching DNA databasing and license plate scanning will freeze my computer.
[01:32:30.241 --> 01:32:30.701]  Okay.
[01:32:31.803 --> 01:32:32.804]  That's what happened, folks.
[01:32:32.884 --> 01:32:34.146]  I am now unfrozen.
[01:32:34.847 --> 01:32:39.830]  Just took me about three or four minutes to do it and not lose all the information that we had for the program today.
[01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:43.712]  Phone lines are open, 800-259-9231.
[01:32:43.812 --> 01:32:46.033]  Hoping to have Ron Paul join us today.
[01:32:46.053 --> 01:32:50.715]  He's very, very busy, so whenever we arrange these interviews, it's kind of a hit or miss.
[01:32:50.735 --> 01:32:55.898]  We don't know how much time he'll have when he does come, but we're hoping to have about 30 minutes with Ron Paul today.
[01:32:56.538 --> 01:33:00.799]  Though if we don't, you can be sure he'll be up with us in the very, very near future.
[01:33:01.319 --> 01:33:02.499]  We're all crossing our fingers.
[01:33:02.679 --> 01:33:03.699]  Let's go back to the phones.
[01:33:03.819 --> 01:33:07.200]  Coyote in Colorado, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.520]  How you doing, Jack?
[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:09.620]  I'm doing okay.
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:10.280]  Good.
[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:19.242]  Well, you know, to kind of segue in, I have a couple of comments and then something I want to talk about.
[01:33:19.782 --> 01:33:20.282]  Fire away.
[01:33:20.662 --> 01:33:24.403]  The farewell address that I gave 46 years ago today
[01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:52.991]  He not only warned about the military-industrial complex, but he also warned about a second complex, about four paragraphs down, and he connects them with the intervening paragraphs, and that's the scientific-technological elite, and that segues into what you are talking about now with the database and DNA and that whole deal.
[01:33:53.638 --> 01:33:57.220]  And how the military industrial complex, these guys come together.
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:06.925]  So what we have really is a media-driven governmental military structure that is heading for
[01:34:08.025 --> 01:34:12.148]  You know, some kind of scientific technological wonderland for the elite.
[01:34:12.428 --> 01:34:15.309]  Well, I mean, good for you for bringing that up, and that's exactly right.
[01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:18.591]  We often talk about Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.
[01:34:18.631 --> 01:34:27.376]  I like to call it a Brave New World order, where he predicts a scientific dictatorship, one in which the citizens won't even know they're enslaved by.
[01:34:27.396 --> 01:34:33.119]  Of course, as we know, his brother Julian Huxley, first head of UNESCO, tied right to the Club of Rome.
[01:34:33.179 --> 01:34:35.560]  And actually, really great reading is...
[01:34:37.021 --> 01:34:51.546]  Brave New World Revisited, where Huxley compares his book to 1984 and gives you more of a Pavlovian scientific dictatorship future than one where you're punished and locked into your homes and tortured continuously.
[01:34:51.566 --> 01:34:57.288]  This is certainly something that you can't really do to everybody, and maybe in a way is a little bit of a fantasy.
[01:34:57.308 --> 01:34:59.709]  But the scientific dictatorship is not a fantasy.
[01:34:59.989 --> 01:35:00.869]  It's a reality.
[01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:17.582]  Certainly, and then I'm reminded also, Coyote, of Zbigniew Brzezinski's passage in his book Between Two Ages, where he predicts that the future will be run, it will be called a technotronic era, run by a few elites, unrestrained by morals.
[01:35:18.122 --> 01:35:18.663]  Exactly.
[01:35:19.183 --> 01:35:26.509]  Those are the guys that, you know, they have the special card that basically lets them go by.
[01:35:28.234 --> 01:35:41.142]  The thing that's interesting about this whole thing is that Eisenhower warned against it, too, and we are not that... You know, we get the military-industrial complex part, and then people cut it off at the end of that paragraph.
[01:35:41.182 --> 01:35:47.766]  You go down two, three paragraphs, and he's tied it all together, and he put the whole thing together, including the media.
[01:35:48.667 --> 01:35:54.811]  And I remember a quote that when he gave that speech...
[01:35:55.701 --> 01:35:59.604]  Nelson Rockefeller just had a hissy fit.
[01:36:00.264 --> 01:36:02.746]  There's a quote, and I can't remember exactly who it was.
[01:36:03.206 --> 01:36:04.527]  I don't know if it was Buchanan.
[01:36:05.788 --> 01:36:11.332]  But Rockefeller had a hissy fit that Eisenhower put all that stuff in there.
[01:36:11.992 --> 01:36:15.615]  And, I mean, it was expletives deleted running everywhere.
[01:36:16.075 --> 01:36:16.775]  Yeah, I heard about that.
[01:36:17.136 --> 01:36:18.176]  Because they didn't want that.
[01:36:18.617 --> 01:36:23.200]  But anyway, the reason why I called is to let everybody know that the...
[01:36:24.373 --> 01:36:32.800]  The Border Patrol agents, Jose Campeon and Ignacio Ramos... Had to turn themselves in today?
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:40.486]  Yeah, and they are... The interesting thing is most people don't know anything about it because there was no media play with it.
[01:36:42.467 --> 01:36:43.828]  Well, there was here in Texas.
[01:36:43.908 --> 01:36:49.853]  It was debated ad nauseum on all of the media channels here and, of course, on Lou Dobbs as well.
[01:36:49.873 --> 01:36:50.133]  Go ahead.
[01:36:50.441 --> 01:37:01.531]  Well, the unfortunate thing is that very few people know, outside of Texas, or maybe southern Colorado, what actually went on that day.
[01:37:01.931 --> 01:37:03.572]  And there's a website.
[01:37:03.813 --> 01:37:07.256]  It's called AmericanFreedomWriters.com.
[01:37:08.296 --> 01:37:18.205]  And there is a letter that was written by Ramos' father-in-law to his congressman, Walter Jones, in North Carolina.
[01:37:18.905 --> 01:37:22.333]  That describes everything that went on that day.
[01:37:23.015 --> 01:37:26.103]  And these guys were railroaded, and this is part of the game.
[01:37:26.664 --> 01:37:27.787]  They are actually...
[01:37:28.979 --> 01:37:29.740]  They are innocent.
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:30.640]  They did nothing.
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:36.584]  As a matter of fact, they didn't even take the drug dealer into custody that day.
[01:37:36.964 --> 01:37:38.004]  He was running away.
[01:37:38.405 --> 01:37:39.765]  Well, he ran across the border.
[01:37:40.045 --> 01:37:40.786]  Ran across the border.
[01:37:40.806 --> 01:37:42.507]  And this became an international incident.
[01:37:42.767 --> 01:37:45.729]  And, of course, this is where the pressure was laid to bear.
[01:37:45.769 --> 01:37:51.612]  And these people were made to be examples of the policies which are integrating into the North American Union.
[01:37:51.912 --> 01:38:00.643]  I mean, they shot a guy trying to smuggle drugs or God knows what over the border doing their job that we employ them to do and going to jail for it.
[01:38:00.663 --> 01:38:02.145]  It wouldn't be the first time this has happened.
[01:38:02.285 --> 01:38:04.107]  Jack, have you ever been shot in the butt cheek?
[01:38:05.028 --> 01:38:06.029]  Yes, I have many times.
[01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:07.071]  It's extremely painful.
[01:38:08.192 --> 01:38:10.275]  Extremely painful and very hard to run.
[01:38:12.285 --> 01:38:27.076]  Well, if your life, look, now I'm reminded of Zakaoui, the terrorist who ran away from a score of Humvees on his artificial leg through the desert and got away in Iraq before they caught him for the umpteenth time.
[01:38:27.116 --> 01:38:29.357]  So I guess anything's possible, Coyote.
[01:38:31.159 --> 01:38:32.420]  So what are you alluding to here?
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:38.444]  Basically, what I think people need to do is they need to get on the horn.
[01:38:39.405 --> 01:38:41.046]  There's plenty of phone numbers out there.
[01:38:42.182 --> 01:38:47.766]  You can call, especially the United States Attorney General's office.
[01:38:49.088 --> 01:38:50.229]  And that phone number is 210-384-7400.
[01:38:50.249 --> 01:38:53.131]  And that's the San Antonio office.
[01:38:53.191 --> 01:38:55.373]  And the Department of Justice...
[01:39:03.042 --> 01:39:04.882]  Those guys you can only email.
[01:39:04.922 --> 01:39:05.823]  I can't remember.
[01:39:05.903 --> 01:39:08.103]  Is there anybody really sticking up for these guys?
[01:39:08.143 --> 01:39:09.183]  Any organizations?
[01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.643]  Anybody on this case at all?
[01:39:11.584 --> 01:39:17.005]  Yeah, the folks over at the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps.
[01:39:17.465 --> 01:39:18.425]  I would figure that.
[01:39:18.545 --> 01:39:20.145]  The boots on the ground guys.
[01:39:20.405 --> 01:39:24.986]  Everybody knows about the Minuteman Project, but very few people know about the boots on the ground guys.
[01:39:25.606 --> 01:39:27.326]  And we are the boots on the ground guys.
[01:39:28.367 --> 01:39:30.767]  And if you want to go there,
[01:39:31.657 --> 01:39:38.086]  Just go to MinutemanHQ.com and everything's in there.
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:44.121]  We are really trying to get these... We have, as I said, a number of cases like this.
[01:39:44.461 --> 01:39:58.504]  I'm reminded of Dog the Bounty Hunter, who went in and arrested somebody on bond in Mexico, and now there's a big war within Congress whether they're going to send him to jail, to be in jail in Mexico, for hauling in this killer.
[01:39:58.964 --> 01:40:00.625]  And what was his name?
[01:40:03.338 --> 01:40:04.880]  Oh, he was a Max Factor heir.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:08.624]  Yeah, Andrew Factor or something like that.
[01:40:08.684 --> 01:40:13.530]  Yeah, he's a convicted rapist and murderer.
[01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:15.212]  But he defended Mexico.
[01:40:15.885 --> 01:40:16.845]  Yeah, well, you know.
[01:40:16.885 --> 01:40:18.086]  We can't offend Mexico.
[01:40:18.346 --> 01:40:21.747]  No, we can't have bounty hunters or anyone crossing the Mexican border.
[01:40:21.767 --> 01:40:23.567]  Or we can't have people defending our borders.
[01:40:23.968 --> 01:40:24.388]  That's it.
[01:40:24.628 --> 01:40:26.108]  We can't cross into their borders.
[01:40:26.128 --> 01:40:26.688]  Try that one.
[01:40:26.909 --> 01:40:27.429]  Good point.
[01:40:28.209 --> 01:40:29.669]  And that was a great call, Coyote.
[01:40:29.709 --> 01:40:31.570]  If I had the prize, I'd give you that.
[01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:33.191]  That was a great call all the way around.
[01:40:33.251 --> 01:40:34.591]  I appreciate you calling in today.
[01:40:35.111 --> 01:40:36.672]  Let's go to Charles in Chicago.
[01:40:36.732 --> 01:40:37.812]  Charles, thank you for calling in.
[01:40:37.832 --> 01:40:38.872]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:40.333]  How are you today, Jack?
[01:40:40.353 --> 01:40:40.733]  I'm okay.
[01:40:41.277 --> 01:40:43.339]  On your show, I just wanted to give you some information.
[01:40:43.379 --> 01:40:54.049]  Some people can get out of the problems associated with having a state driver's license by getting an international driver's permit, or sometimes it's called international driver's license.
[01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:56.711]  It's about $1,500, I believe.
[01:40:56.771 --> 01:41:01.495]  There are websites you can go to and get information on obtaining them.
[01:41:01.595 --> 01:41:04.458]  I've got to tell you, I'm not a big believer in this working.
[01:41:04.778 --> 01:41:06.480]  I guess people can try anything they want.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:07.741]  You want to give out a website for it?
[01:41:08.539 --> 01:41:08.799]  Sure.
[01:41:09.439 --> 01:41:11.340]  I use ToolsForFreedom.com.
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:19.642]  They have a lot of different products available that patriots would enjoy and help keep them out of the system.
[01:41:19.762 --> 01:41:29.085]  Another thing that a person can do, quite frankly, is to place their cars into a trust and then that can help eliminate a lot of state involvement with registration.
[01:41:29.105 --> 01:41:29.325]  Sure.
[01:41:29.865 --> 01:41:31.645]  Then a couple of cases I wanted to give you.
[01:41:31.925 --> 01:41:37.767]  First of all, a driver's license is not required and here are the Supreme Court cases people can review.
[01:41:38.422 --> 01:41:43.504]  Thompson v. Smith, and the second case is Hendrick v. Maryland.
[01:41:44.204 --> 01:41:51.147]  Originally, the driver's license would be used by people who were engaged in interstate commerce, like a chauffeur.
[01:41:51.568 --> 01:41:52.388]  In these cases,
[01:41:55.174 --> 01:41:58.997]  I understand.
[01:41:59.037 --> 01:42:01.139]  Charles, there's a lot of information on about this.
[01:42:01.179 --> 01:42:05.022]  We have interviewed people over and over and over again on these topics.
[01:42:05.883 --> 01:42:09.846]  Folks, personally, I think non-participation is the best way.
[01:42:10.767 --> 01:42:12.789]  You don't participate in the process at all.
[01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.830]  We're good to go.
[01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:14.230]  We're good to go.
[01:42:14.250 --> 01:42:14.810]  We're good to go.
[01:42:37.869 --> 01:42:41.190]  I got to tell you, I admire people that do these things.
[01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:43.010]  I just don't like recommending them.
[01:42:43.671 --> 01:42:46.951]  That's going to be a long-winded conversation to explain to you why.
[01:42:46.971 --> 01:42:48.832]  You'll have to trust me on that.
[01:42:48.952 --> 01:42:49.612]  We'll leave it there.
[01:42:49.972 --> 01:42:51.292]  Let's go to Larry in Indiana.
[01:42:51.432 --> 01:42:52.613]  Larry, thank you for holding.
[01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:54.393]  A lot of calls from Indiana on the program.
[01:42:54.433 --> 01:42:55.313]  Good to have you on the show, Larry.
[01:42:56.214 --> 01:43:04.216]  Jack, I want you to take a cold look at who the globalists go after with the kangaroo trials, ambushes, murder, etc.
[01:43:04.236 --> 01:43:05.676]  The ones they really fear are
[01:43:06.263 --> 01:43:10.704]  are the ones advocating, preparing for physical resistance.
[01:43:11.384 --> 01:43:24.507]  So before you cast that musket down, take a look at what they've done to Bob Stewart and Fritz Springweier, Scott Woodring, Dick Traficant, and Mark Kernke, who they may or may not let out here on March 15th.
[01:43:24.567 --> 01:43:28.348]  I mean, he's the one that started the kernel of what became GCN.
[01:43:29.668 --> 01:43:33.989]  They're out there practicing drills to murder most of us
[01:43:34.628 --> 01:43:43.009]  We need to be practicing so that we know how to shoot a target if the time comes, which they're going to try and do everything they can.
[01:43:43.069 --> 01:43:45.310]  When did I say not to do something like that?
[01:43:45.690 --> 01:43:48.050]  You said we could pick up our muskets here.
[01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:51.611]  I don't know how much good that would do in 2007.
[01:43:51.851 --> 01:43:55.772]  I'm talking about an offensive, and you're talking about a defensive.
[01:43:55.992 --> 01:43:58.112]  There's a big world of difference here.
[01:43:58.372 --> 01:44:03.673]  We can't go on the offensive, but we are granted, biblically, the right to defense, and that's what they fear.
[01:44:04.383 --> 01:44:10.788]  They fear us organizing and practicing and being able to counter what they're preparing for.
[01:44:10.908 --> 01:44:12.910]  Again, I don't disagree with you.
[01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:15.312]  We need to be ready for a defense.
[01:44:15.812 --> 01:44:19.435]  Otherwise, it's going to be cherry picking, shooting fish in a barrel.
[01:44:19.816 --> 01:44:27.462]  Obviously, again, if we look at the Middle East right now, we see a pretty good example of what can happen if you are ready for a defense.
[01:44:28.334 --> 01:44:31.618]  Which, the best defense is a good offense.
[01:44:31.638 --> 01:44:41.368]  So, I mean, once you're in the position to have to defend yourself from foreign enemies or foreign militaries or unlawful or illegal measures by the government, well, all bets are off.
[01:44:41.428 --> 01:44:47.875]  But all I was saying is not firing the first shot because you're just outgunned.
[01:44:49.284 --> 01:44:53.692]  Well, and they'll actually stage events making it look like you'll fire the first shot.
[01:44:54.113 --> 01:44:55.896]  Like you say, false flag terrorism.
[01:44:55.916 --> 01:44:58.541]  They use it on individuals as well as groups.
[01:44:58.642 --> 01:44:58.782]  Yeah.
[01:44:59.871 --> 01:45:01.192]  But I just want to make that point.
[01:45:01.232 --> 01:45:03.554]  People need to be getting out and practicing.
[01:45:03.874 --> 01:45:06.496]  I was glad to clear that up, and I agree with you wholeheartedly.
[01:45:06.556 --> 01:45:12.820]  Being prepared, knowing how to use firearms, having firearms, having ammunition, this is just part of the American way.
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:19.444]  And yes, they are trying to outlaw, they're trying to make it illegal, and they're certainly making examples out of people who are doing this.
[01:45:19.464 --> 01:45:27.029]  We've been covering the Wayne Fincher story in Arkansas as well, and certainly that was a witch hunt in a kangaroo court.
[01:45:27.129 --> 01:45:29.131]  And here's a guy who's a constitutionalist.
[01:45:29.971 --> 01:45:31.512]  Just an amazing individual.
[01:45:31.773 --> 01:45:33.234]  Helps people in his community.
[01:45:33.714 --> 01:45:40.039]  And we're going to frame him and use him as an example of what a terrorist might be.
[01:45:40.079 --> 01:45:41.940]  It's absolutely ludicrous and outrageous.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.501]  Sixty-some years old, wasn't he?
[01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:43.801]  Yeah.
[01:45:43.921 --> 01:45:45.863]  And I agree with you on what you're saying, Larry.
[01:45:45.883 --> 01:45:47.424]  So I think you just misunderstood me here.
[01:45:47.444 --> 01:45:52.367]  I just want to make the point, because it seems like a lot of talk shows put that down.
[01:45:52.407 --> 01:45:54.329]  But that's the one thing they fear.
[01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:58.572]  That's the one thing I want to see people... You know, they've tried to demonize militias.
[01:45:58.973 --> 01:46:03.795]  The ATF was practicing blowing up rider trucks a year before Oklahoma City.
[01:46:04.215 --> 01:46:05.275]  That's been confirmed.
[01:46:06.656 --> 01:46:08.836]  They did that to demonize militias.
[01:46:08.856 --> 01:46:11.157]  McVeigh had nothing to do with militias.
[01:46:11.697 --> 01:46:12.498]  On and on and on.
[01:46:12.898 --> 01:46:14.378]  That's what they want people to fear.
[01:46:15.139 --> 01:46:18.120]  We need to practice and we need to have something to counter them when the time comes.
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:18.900]  Good point.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:19.700]  Point taken.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.381]  Good call.
[01:46:20.441 --> 01:46:21.761]  Thank you, Larry in Indiana.
[01:46:21.781 --> 01:46:23.542]  Let's go to Tony in Pennsylvania.
[01:46:23.622 --> 01:46:24.802]  Tony, thank you for calling.
[01:46:24.842 --> 01:46:25.882]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:26.743 --> 01:46:27.223]  Hey, Jack.
[01:46:27.363 --> 01:46:27.423]  I'm
[01:46:27.967 --> 01:46:29.148]  Nice to hear you're on.
[01:46:29.568 --> 01:46:33.712]  I like the way you conduct yourself on the radio.
[01:46:34.173 --> 01:46:36.194]  It's really, your voice just comes across.
[01:46:36.955 --> 01:46:38.036]  You can't miss anything you say.
[01:46:38.096 --> 01:46:38.476]  It's great.
[01:46:38.617 --> 01:46:39.397]  Well, I appreciate it.
[01:46:39.417 --> 01:46:39.618]  Thank you.
[01:46:39.638 --> 01:46:40.278]  Glad to have you back.
[01:46:40.338 --> 01:46:42.480]  Hey, I just wanted to bring something up.
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:51.188]  I couldn't get on your radio show yesterday, and I was kind of upset, but I couldn't get on, and finally I called in and said, well, just listen via the 800 number, and that was nice that they did that.
[01:46:51.857 --> 01:47:02.106]  But you were talking to the gentleman who was having, who is now, it wasn't the gentleman who was in that militia, but one of his people that are working with him, and now he's being locked up for that.
[01:47:02.146 --> 01:47:06.851]  Yeah, Joe McCutcheon has been following that Fincher case and has been working with us, yeah, doing a great job.
[01:47:07.251 --> 01:47:09.393]  That's really sad, sad, you know.
[01:47:10.188 --> 01:47:15.732]  You know, when you think about Columbine, you think about Waco, you think about all this stuff that's going on.
[01:47:15.752 --> 01:47:26.659]  Hey, I lost my cool yesterday, if you heard, because, I mean, here I am reporting this story, and then I have to go to the story of Ed and Elaine Brown in New Hampshire who are waiting for the feds to come take them off their land.
[01:47:26.719 --> 01:47:32.422]  I mean, it's just one thing after the other, and we get stories like this here at our headquarters almost every day.
[01:47:32.783 --> 01:47:39.607]  Right, and it's sad because the average American, a very large majority of the population is
[01:47:40.029 --> 01:47:41.249]  They're not skilled at arms.
[01:47:42.029 --> 01:47:52.052]  And we as Americans, and I hear stories like this all the time, there's people from Australia that I know, and now they're going after their swords in Australia.
[01:47:52.072 --> 01:47:57.593]  And they outlawed butter knives, so people are trying to outlaw butter knives or knives in general in England.
[01:47:57.733 --> 01:48:07.376]  Yeah, so from one American... Meanwhile, sorry, meanwhile, the cops are now actively carrying M16s and machine guns in full militarized riot gear on the streets of England, okay?
[01:48:07.416 --> 01:48:08.036]  Isn't that something?
[01:48:08.196 --> 01:48:08.816]  Isn't that something?
[01:48:09.352 --> 01:48:30.216]  You know, the American people need to wake up, and I hope that, and I pray to Yahweh Father that everybody that's listening to my voice over this, that if people begin to get skilled at arms, really, I'm not saying go out there and get ready and get into militias or anything like that, not that there's anything wrong with that, but, you know, I'm not saying that, but I'm saying so that you can protect your family.
[01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:32.879]  That when the time comes, you have to protect your home.
[01:48:32.959 --> 01:48:36.662]  Look, I mean, I use this example perpetually.
[01:48:37.342 --> 01:48:39.944]  And we look at what happened in New Orleans, okay?
[01:48:40.505 --> 01:48:47.851]  And the people there that were able to protect themselves, that were able to take care of themselves, rode that whole disaster out without a hitch.
[01:48:48.331 --> 01:48:48.551]  Right.
[01:48:48.771 --> 01:48:50.212]  And that was just a matter of the fact.
[01:48:50.272 --> 01:49:04.196]  And, you know, we lived in New Orleans, so I knew a lot of people down there, and we heard stories of roving mobs, okay, and there was some severe poverty in ghettos there, and this is what these people do, running around listening for...
[01:49:05.476 --> 01:49:06.437]  We're good to go.
[01:49:28.237 --> 01:49:30.198]  Because I want to give you a great website people can go to.
[01:49:30.218 --> 01:49:32.499]  Yeah, I'm going to hold you over for just a second on the other side, Tony.
[01:49:32.519 --> 01:49:36.061]  We're going to go to Andrew and Fred and others patiently holding at 800-259-9231.
[01:49:36.501 --> 01:49:38.762]  I think we have a line open.
[01:49:39.062 --> 01:49:41.283]  We're also hoping Ron Paul will join us today on the program.
[01:49:41.303 --> 01:49:44.365]  This is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:55.965 --> 01:49:59.107]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.467 --> 01:50:01.388]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:01.788 --> 01:50:09.452]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.132 --> 01:50:17.176]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.576 --> 01:50:20.518]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:20.898 --> 01:50:23.219]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:24.480]  NSA spies.
[01:50:25.876 --> 01:50:28.978]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:50:29.298 --> 01:50:32.821]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.261 --> 01:50:35.162]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.522 --> 01:50:39.445]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.269 --> 01:50:55.310]  The war on terrorism.
[01:50:55.630 --> 01:50:58.433]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:50:58.693 --> 01:51:02.836]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:51:03.277 --> 01:51:04.097]  So what do you do?
[01:51:04.418 --> 01:51:09.001]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:51:09.482 --> 01:51:11.604]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:51:12.104 --> 01:51:13.005]  Sheltering in Place.
[01:51:13.405 --> 01:51:17.128]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:51:17.429 --> 01:51:22.673]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health

[01:52:55.657 --> 01:52:58.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:01.818 --> 01:53:04.899]  I am the raptor of political talk radio.
[01:53:04.959 --> 01:53:07.600]  I'm Jack Blood, your radio gun, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:09.300]  Alex will be back on Monday.
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:12.561]  Appreciate everybody calling in today.
[01:53:12.601 --> 01:53:13.742]  You've been a great help.
[01:53:13.782 --> 01:53:15.422]  You've made this a great show so far.
[01:53:15.462 --> 01:53:16.262]  You can call in.
[01:53:16.282 --> 01:53:17.303]  You can pick my brain.
[01:53:17.383 --> 01:53:30.147]  And the good news is, if I can't give you an answer, there's a good chance someone in this great listening audience, I think the greatest listening audience on all of radio, even greater than my audience, now my listeners will be tuning out, but...
[01:53:31.704 --> 01:53:35.888]  We'll find a way to answer your questions so you can bring up anything you want.
[01:53:36.148 --> 01:53:38.670]  If I can't get you, I think someone else will be able to call in.
[01:53:38.690 --> 01:53:41.032]  Also, I want to cover more news in the program.
[01:53:41.052 --> 01:53:44.956]  Still expecting Ron Paul to join us in the third hour of the broadcast today.
[01:53:45.296 --> 01:53:50.360]  God willing, hopefully we'll all be able to enjoy Ron on the program today.
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:51.541]  I want to go back to the phones.
[01:53:51.681 --> 01:53:53.563]  We had Troy in Pennsylvania holding over.
[01:53:53.623 --> 01:53:55.565]  Troy, I didn't want to cut you off in the commercial, so go ahead.
[01:53:55.605 --> 01:53:56.045]  It's all yours.
[01:53:56.326 --> 01:53:56.546]  Okay.
[01:53:57.907 --> 01:54:04.690]  There's two things I want to address, and that's the constitutional issues with these gentlemen that are having these problems with their driver's license and stuff like that.
[01:54:04.710 --> 01:54:05.931]  There's an awesome website.
[01:54:06.491 --> 01:54:11.894]  It's called citizensoftheamericanconstitution.org.
[01:54:12.354 --> 01:54:12.874]  All one word.
[01:54:13.354 --> 01:54:16.956]  Citizensoftheamericanconstitution.org.
[01:54:17.036 --> 01:54:17.477]  Go there.
[01:54:17.577 --> 01:54:18.497]  Those guys are awesome.
[01:54:18.737 --> 01:54:19.898]  You're going to enjoy that website.
[01:54:20.238 --> 01:54:25.961]  And as far as the firearms issue, Dr. Ignatius Piazza is one heck of an American man.
[01:54:26.641 --> 01:54:28.243]  His website is Front Sight.
[01:54:28.683 --> 01:54:30.365]  You know, like the sight, you look out sight?
[01:54:30.866 --> 01:54:36.051]  Front Sight, that's F-R-O-N-T S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:54:36.732 --> 01:54:37.853]  Front Sight dot com.
[01:54:38.054 --> 01:54:40.056]  I am also a member of his organization.
[01:54:40.612 --> 01:54:46.133]  They're doing some awesome bang-up jobs training the people to be proficient at arms.
[01:54:46.453 --> 01:54:49.194]  Well, thank you, Tony, for sharing all that information with us.
[01:54:49.234 --> 01:54:50.054]  I really appreciate it.
[01:54:50.074 --> 01:54:50.754]  Thanks for calling.
[01:54:51.174 --> 01:55:08.778]  That's the thing about the Alex Jones Show, about this network, is try calling in with multiple websites about constitutional ideas or constitutional law to the Sean Vanity Show or the Lush Limp Baugh Show or the Neil Boring Show or the Laura Ingrate Show.
[01:55:08.898 --> 01:55:10.138]  See how far you'll get with that.
[01:55:10.898 --> 01:55:13.999]  But we allow that here to a point, okay?
[01:55:14.019 --> 01:55:15.100]  Don't abuse the privilege.
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:17.700]  Andrew in Missouri, thank you for calling in.
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:19.101]  You're on the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:55:19.641 --> 01:55:24.483]  Yeah, I was wondering, I've heard some things about Ruby Ridge.
[01:55:24.863 --> 01:55:26.643]  I'm not familiar with that.
[01:55:26.863 --> 01:55:28.444]  Can you clarify that for me?
[01:55:29.584 --> 01:55:31.065]  Can I clarify it for you?
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:34.262]  There's a great book on it.
[01:55:34.582 --> 01:55:38.549]  There's several books on it, but the one I like is by Randy Weaver himself.
[01:55:39.110 --> 01:55:41.434]  It's his account on what happened on Ruby Ridge.
[01:55:41.474 --> 01:55:47.064]  Of course, this happened under the wonderful script reader weatherman Bill Clinton.
[01:55:48.446 --> 01:55:50.828]  And how do I give you the short version of this story?
[01:55:50.908 --> 01:55:59.454]  Randy Weaver was working in militias, and he was, like a lot of listeners to this show, a lover of freedom, a lover of the Constitution.
[01:56:00.115 --> 01:56:10.243]  He had been set up by one of his alleged acquaintances who had turned state's evidence for the FBI in order to avoid being wrapped up himself.
[01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:11.183]  This is what a lot of people do.
[01:56:11.223 --> 01:56:12.104]  They turn into rats.
[01:56:12.651 --> 01:56:15.754]  They set up Randy Weaver for selling a sawed-off shotgun.
[01:56:15.874 --> 01:56:18.416]  One sawed-off shotgun to a guy who was his friend.
[01:56:18.636 --> 01:56:20.638]  And the guy asked him, set him up and asked him to do it.
[01:56:20.918 --> 01:56:25.602]  Well, again, this led to a number of warrants for his arrest.
[01:56:25.642 --> 01:56:28.564]  He refused to turn himself in.
[01:56:28.624 --> 01:56:33.168]  They had relocated up into Ruby Ridge, which is a fairly desolate area.
[01:56:33.208 --> 01:56:34.729]  A compound, you can call it.
[01:56:35.650 --> 01:56:41.495]  Things escalated rather quickly when the FBI and the BTAF set up and were...
[01:56:42.222 --> 01:56:42.923]  We're good to go.
[01:56:58.948 --> 01:57:02.491]  They then proceeded to shoot his wife while she was holding her baby.
[01:57:03.251 --> 01:57:06.314]  Shot one of the guests at the compound.
[01:57:06.654 --> 01:57:13.859]  Nearly killed the entire family until Jack McClam and Bo Greitz went up and mediated their release.
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:16.882]  Heads eventually rolled on this.
[01:57:16.982 --> 01:57:19.063]  But just a horrible, horrible story.
[01:57:19.083 --> 01:57:23.106]  If you're on the internet, look up Ruby Ridge or get the book by Randy Weaver.
[01:57:23.146 --> 01:57:25.308]  I know it helps support him and his family.
[01:57:25.668 --> 01:57:26.409]  He's a great guy.
[01:57:26.449 --> 01:57:27.550]  We've talked to him many times.
[01:57:28.328 --> 01:57:29.248]  That's about all I can say on that.
[01:57:29.268 --> 01:57:29.769]  We'll come right back.
[01:57:29.789 --> 01:57:30.849]  More of your calls right after this.
[01:57:32.770 --> 01:57:36.671]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:36.991 --> 01:57:39.372]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.095 --> 01:57:49.756]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.416 --> 01:57:51.496]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.176 --> 01:57:53.297]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.937 --> 01:57:54.737]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.498 --> 01:57:56.278]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.066 --> 01:58:01.049]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.249 --> 01:58:05.373]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.697 --> 01:58:16.481]  Third hour of the Alex Jones Show coming your way on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:17.582 --> 01:58:19.603]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:58:20.684 --> 01:58:22.265]  My website's our jackblood.com.
[01:58:22.486 --> 01:58:24.607]  Uncoverthenews.com.
[01:58:25.168 --> 01:58:26.188]  That's our dial-up site.
[01:58:27.208 --> 01:58:29.129]  I had to at least throw out one plug for myself today.
[01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:29.689]  Okay.
[01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:32.351]  Phone lines are doing well today.
[01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:32.991]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:33.091 --> 01:58:43.977]  We're really jumping around to a lot of topics, but I think it's a good way to kind of get your pulse, get you on the record, and give this show a life of its own here this Wednesday.
[01:58:44.017 --> 01:58:45.358]  And I appreciate everybody calling in.
[01:58:45.398 --> 01:58:47.119]  We'll take calls as long as we can.
[01:58:47.159 --> 01:58:50.701]  We are just told that Ron Paul will join us in 30 minutes on the broadcast today.
[01:58:51.764 --> 01:58:54.506]  And we'll try to take a few calls for Ron Paul as well.
[01:58:54.526 --> 01:58:56.247]  I know people are going to be wanting to talk to him.
[01:58:56.267 --> 01:59:00.169]  And what we'll probably do is go rapid fire and let you say something to him.
[01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:05.753]  We'll go and everybody can make a quick statement or pat him on the back or tell him to give up or whatever you want to do.
[01:59:06.473 --> 01:59:10.195]  We do have a lot of news here to report, but I think it's important that we go to these phone calls.
[01:59:10.215 --> 01:59:11.036]  And we're going to go to them now.
[01:59:11.156 --> 01:59:16.119]  Just real quick, the book by Randy and Sarah Weaver is The Federal Siege at Ruby Ridge.
[01:59:16.719 --> 01:59:23.565]  And if you haven't read this book, this personal account by Randy Weaver, I think you really missed the boat as far as Ruby Ridge goes.
[01:59:23.585 --> 01:59:26.168]  But it really proves who is the enemy here.
[01:59:26.788 --> 01:59:31.993]  It also proves, when you put it in the context of what happened at Waco, what happened...
[01:59:32.625 --> 01:59:33.186]  We're good to go.
[01:59:33.206 --> 01:59:33.667]  We're good to go.
[01:59:33.687 --> 01:59:34.147]  We're good to go.
[01:59:48.519 --> 01:59:54.081]  Put down into this country during the Clinton years, and I know it's hard for a lot of people to see it.
[01:59:54.101 --> 01:59:55.262]  It was never portrayed that way.
[01:59:55.282 --> 02:00:01.324]  These people are always portrayed as nutcases, militia types, gun nuts, crazies.
[02:00:01.405 --> 02:00:04.046]  Well, now we see who the real crazies were.
[02:00:05.126 --> 02:00:06.147]  It wasn't you and me.
[02:00:06.187 --> 02:00:11.629]  It wasn't those of us trying to defend our families and protect ourselves and trying to get out of the system.
[02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:21.454]  It wasn't those of us who were fighting the Infowar and trying to get out of information even before there was a cooperative and cohesive Internet.
[02:00:21.734 --> 02:00:26.838]  No, it was the people lying in wait to form the Project for a New American Century.
[02:00:27.138 --> 02:00:41.066]  It was the people, Bill Clinton, Janet Reno, Wesley Clark, and others, who perpetuated these crimes against the American people and then used that to draft the Crime Bill, which was the precursor for the Patriot Act.
[02:00:41.821 --> 02:00:52.825]  And it was the people that soon followed that killed 3,000 of our own people on 9-11-2001 and then worked to enslave them and feed them into the meat grinder thereafter.
[02:00:53.445 --> 02:00:56.066]  So we know who the real terrorists are.
[02:00:56.086 --> 02:00:58.147]  According to our government, it's us.
[02:00:58.767 --> 02:01:01.008]  We are all potential criminals and terrorists.
[02:01:01.208 --> 02:01:04.950]  And for our safety, they will take any measure possible.
[02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:06.951]  A minute ago, a few calls ago...
[02:01:09.497 --> 02:01:11.218]  It was a coyote in California called in.
[02:01:11.238 --> 02:01:13.919]  It had a great call talking about the scientific dictatorship.
[02:01:13.959 --> 02:01:21.923]  And I often say this, and I think it's important to try to say this as much as possible and to remind you that we live in one of the most important... No, not one of the most.
[02:01:22.223 --> 02:01:25.085]  The most important generation in human history.
[02:01:25.968 --> 02:01:28.730]  And it is precisely because of the technology.
[02:01:28.750 --> 02:01:42.422]  It is precisely because we have become an enemy of our own government with the assistance of this scientific dictatorship and this one world order that we have to fight more and clearer
[02:01:43.644 --> 02:01:44.484]  Than ever before.
[02:01:44.904 --> 02:01:50.646]  Lest we have to explain to our children, our grandchildren, and their grandchildren why we dropped the ball.
[02:01:51.126 --> 02:02:00.249]  Because we are being locked into a scientific dictatorship, a scientific police state prison, of which we will never escape if we don't nip it in the bud.
[02:02:00.289 --> 02:02:03.270]  And I think we are way behind in doing that.
[02:02:05.633 --> 02:02:12.135]  This is why it is so important that people fight the Real ID Act and people fight these technological advances.
[02:02:12.695 --> 02:02:25.718]  We have to report stories on our program that the military dictatorship, the scientific dictatorship, that find a way to turn you into a battery using the carbon and heat from your body, much like the movie The Matrix.
[02:02:26.138 --> 02:02:29.179]  Or how they can manipulate the fear gene to control you.
[02:02:29.459 --> 02:02:32.340]  And how every child will be implanted with a microchip.
[02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:35.630]  That's why we live in the most important time in human history.
[02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:36.690]  I think you get that.
[02:02:36.850 --> 02:02:38.331]  We'll come right back with your calls after this.
[02:02:38.351 --> 02:02:38.851]  Stay tuned.
[02:02:47.815 --> 02:02:51.016]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:51.376 --> 02:02:53.337]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:53.697 --> 02:03:01.320]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:09.083]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.463 --> 02:03:20.888]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House probing to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.208 --> 02:03:24.730]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.170 --> 02:03:27.111]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.431 --> 02:03:31.273]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:49.467 --> 02:03:53.911]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:03:54.092 --> 02:04:08.106]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.

[02:04:37.011 --> 02:04:40.754]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:41.355 --> 02:04:43.196]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:44.317 --> 02:04:46.679]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:04:46.699 --> 02:04:49.282]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:04:49.342 --> 02:04:54.026]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:04:54.708 --> 02:05:01.510]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse, or adding machine.
[02:05:02.050 --> 02:05:14.914]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:05:15.374 --> 02:05:19.355]  Wrist Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[02:05:19.835 --> 02:05:23.796]  Wrist Ease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and...
[02:05:24.376 --> 02:05:29.898]  WristEase provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[02:05:30.278 --> 02:05:33.279]  You can order WristEase now at WristEase.com.
[02:05:33.679 --> 02:05:40.281]  That's WristEase, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, WristEase.com.
[02:05:40.441 --> 02:05:42.282]  Once again, WristEase.com.
[02:05:44.582 --> 02:05:49.604]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:49.984 --> 02:05:52.325]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:56.427 --> 02:05:58.568]  It is a war for your hearts and your mind.
[02:05:58.588 --> 02:06:01.730]  Isn't this what they always tell us?
[02:06:02.250 --> 02:06:04.371]  We need to get their hearts and their minds.
[02:06:06.512 --> 02:06:09.613]  As I often say, if there's a winner, there's a loser.
[02:06:09.813 --> 02:06:13.975]  So if someone's winning your heart and your mind, then potentially you are the loser.
[02:06:15.627 --> 02:06:16.369]  Real quick here.
[02:06:16.409 --> 02:06:22.759]  A passenger was awarded $400,000 in a racial profiling case regarding airlines.
[02:06:22.859 --> 02:06:28.848]  A jury in Massachusetts ruled on Friday that American Airlines should pay a South Florida man $400,000 in a discrimination case.
[02:06:31.011 --> 02:06:38.259]  John Sequeira and his attorneys accused American Airlines of racial profiling after he was removed from a plane in Boston in December of 2003.
[02:06:38.499 --> 02:06:49.010]  Sequeira said he had visited family in the Boston area and was trying to fly back to the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport when American Airlines officials ordered him and two other men off the plane.
[02:06:49.571 --> 02:06:49.851]  Quote,
[02:06:50.794 --> 02:06:56.559]  I have a feeling these kinds of incidents of racial profiling happen to people more than we're aware of, said Sekira.
[02:06:56.599 --> 02:07:01.563]  Sekira said three Massachusetts state police officers escorted him and two Israeli men off the plane.
[02:07:01.963 --> 02:07:03.545]  They were all questioned and later released.
[02:07:03.605 --> 02:07:05.867]  And they went to the American Airlines ticket counter.
[02:07:06.147 --> 02:07:08.489]  They were refunded their fares, all three of them.
[02:07:08.549 --> 02:07:11.651]  And they were told they were being denied service at that time.
[02:07:11.691 --> 02:07:12.472]  Not charged.
[02:07:12.972 --> 02:07:15.855]  They were let go, but they were going to be denied service.
[02:07:16.355 --> 02:07:16.816]  We're good to go.
[02:07:16.836 --> 02:07:17.616]  We're good to go.
[02:07:35.377 --> 02:07:36.618]  That's wonderful for him.
[02:07:36.638 --> 02:07:46.224]  I don't know what case you might have if you're a Caucasian and this happens to you, because it has happened to many people who are Caucasians.
[02:07:47.005 --> 02:07:58.192]  And of course we know, and we covered a story a while back, that the air marshals were told and given quotas of people that they had to put on terrorist watch lists, people that they had to report and rat on.
[02:07:59.768 --> 02:08:01.930]  And many of them quit in lieu of this.
[02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:04.752]  So again, just picking people out randomly.
[02:08:04.852 --> 02:08:15.679]  I don't know if it has as much to do with race as it has to do with overall conditioning of Americans or people flying in airplanes trying to travel from point A to point B in general.
[02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:19.722]  You're welcome to comment on this as well.
[02:08:19.742 --> 02:08:20.323]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:08:20.583 --> 02:08:21.904]  Let's go to Fred in Philly.
[02:08:21.964 --> 02:08:23.505]  Fred, always good to have you on the show, bud.
[02:08:24.406 --> 02:08:25.006]  Hi, Jack.
[02:08:25.947 --> 02:08:28.529]  I want to lay something out on the issue of...
[02:08:29.878 --> 02:08:30.999]  Well, we're good to go.
[02:08:57.274 --> 02:09:05.217]  Like the car driver's license scanning, calls you make and mail.
[02:09:05.897 --> 02:09:19.721]  Number three would be your premise, like the premise ID data, your family data like census and stuff like that, and associations like who you may be meeting either at home or at a public meeting.
[02:09:19.801 --> 02:09:23.162]  And number four would be your identity like your DNA,
[02:09:23.837 --> 02:09:32.165]  Well, you pretty much wrapped it up in a nutshell, and I have to say they pretty much achieved most or all of those.
[02:09:33.126 --> 02:09:36.268]  Yeah, and with computers, I mean, we don't lack...
[02:09:37.719 --> 02:09:43.724]  The modern memory in computers is just increasing at an incredible rate.
[02:09:43.845 --> 02:09:53.813]  I love the days when to go find out who you were and maybe what you've been up to, they've got to go look in a large room of files and try to locate a file on you.
[02:09:53.853 --> 02:09:57.436]  Eventually they'd have to purge these files because they just wouldn't have room for them, so...
[02:09:57.916 --> 02:09:58.797]  Yeah, you better believe it.
[02:09:58.837 --> 02:10:00.598]  Computers make this much easier.
[02:10:01.019 --> 02:10:11.167]  I guess this goes into the column of technology being a double-edged sword because we certainly are able to communicate better and we're able to fight this info war, get information a lot easier.
[02:10:11.487 --> 02:10:14.370]  But again, be careful what you wish for.
[02:10:14.490 --> 02:10:22.957]  And I wanted to ask you, when you had that arrest, did they say why they were taking your blood?
[02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:24.290]  They didn't take my blood.
[02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.931]  I wouldn't allow it.
[02:10:25.131 --> 02:10:25.591]  Oh, good.
[02:10:25.611 --> 02:10:28.012]  They did, however, confiscate my urine.
[02:10:30.013 --> 02:10:32.795]  Which I fought for, and I was punished.
[02:10:33.235 --> 02:10:42.920]  I think that guy who called in about the DNA, the DWI, I think that's bogus because I think if they don't do it at the time of an arrest...
[02:10:44.961 --> 02:10:47.223]  They can't do it until you're convicted, Fred.
[02:10:47.283 --> 02:10:48.023]  That's the thing.
[02:10:48.064 --> 02:10:54.309]  So he's been convicted of a crime, and this is now the national... Every state's going to be different.
[02:10:54.329 --> 02:11:03.957]  This is the national edict and the national call, and as I mentioned earlier, they're being funded to the tunes of billions of dollars to create these national databases, and this is the pretext they're going to use.
[02:11:05.258 --> 02:11:07.860]  So he can't go to another state and avoid that?
[02:11:08.436 --> 02:11:12.218]  Well, if you're on probation, you know, I don't know about going to another state.
[02:11:12.258 --> 02:11:14.179]  Again, it depends on what kind of probation you're on.
[02:11:14.239 --> 02:11:25.403]  But I believe, and again, I'm not an expert on this, but I believe every state has different laws enforcing the, again, national call for database, just about everybody.
[02:11:25.443 --> 02:11:27.004]  But, I mean, this is something that has to be fought.
[02:11:27.364 --> 02:11:31.066]  Again, don't wait until you get into trouble and you have to give your DNA, Fred.
[02:11:31.306 --> 02:11:35.488]  Start fighting it now so if the day comes when you're arrested at a protest or...
[02:11:36.088 --> 02:11:38.190]  Or something to that nature.
[02:11:38.230 --> 02:11:39.191]  You don't have to do it.
[02:11:39.471 --> 02:11:41.093]  But I'd stand up against it no matter what.
[02:11:41.113 --> 02:11:42.854]  Like I said, you can lock me up and throw away the key.
[02:11:42.874 --> 02:11:43.815]  You're not getting my DNA.
[02:11:44.195 --> 02:11:45.416]  Well, I think you did the right thing.
[02:11:45.456 --> 02:11:48.919]  I mean, did they ask you for a blood thing at that time?
[02:11:48.939 --> 02:11:49.660]  I denied it, yes.
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:51.221]  Okay, I think you did the right thing.
[02:11:51.261 --> 02:11:52.482]  That's all I had to say.
[02:11:52.783 --> 02:11:53.403]  Okay, thanks, Fred.
[02:11:53.483 --> 02:11:53.683]  Thanks.
[02:11:53.804 --> 02:11:54.584]  Always good to hear from you.
[02:11:54.844 --> 02:11:56.666]  Robert in California, thank you for joining us.
[02:11:56.686 --> 02:11:58.848]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, GCN Radio Network.
[02:11:59.874 --> 02:12:00.294]  Good morning.
[02:12:00.834 --> 02:12:02.895]  Good afternoon, sir, actually, for you.
[02:12:02.915 --> 02:12:10.756]  Yeah, just calling in just to let you know that I'm still trying to get some more information on Ron Paul's campaign.
[02:12:10.796 --> 02:12:13.297]  I've been working myself, talking to all my friends.
[02:12:14.277 --> 02:12:18.378]  I wish you'd ask him if he's got a website or something that we can use.
[02:12:19.078 --> 02:12:25.699]  Also on that note, too, as well, sorry to hear about your altercation with the police.
[02:12:25.979 --> 02:12:26.979]  How did that ever come out?
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:27.900]  Anyway, I didn't hear it.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:29.320]  I had a jury trial in May.
[02:12:30.126 --> 02:12:30.806]  Oh, great.
[02:12:30.986 --> 02:12:31.467]  How fun.
[02:12:31.507 --> 02:12:36.228]  I'll be representing myself, doing my opening statements, grilling the witnesses.
[02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:37.869]  We have a ton of witnesses on our side.
[02:12:37.929 --> 02:12:47.732]  We will be putting the police on trial for falsifying a police report and not properly identifying themselves, putting us all in danger at the scene of the alleged crime.
[02:12:48.502 --> 02:12:49.983]  Yeah, it seems that they do it a lot.
[02:12:50.263 --> 02:12:59.246]  I'm sorry for that man with the problem with his driver's license because they also do falsify those reports as well to overblow them.
[02:12:59.306 --> 02:13:00.567]  Just another day in the empire.
[02:13:01.047 --> 02:13:05.209]  Well, I had a problem with a DUI.
[02:13:05.289 --> 02:13:12.332]  I stopped for an accident and I pulled over and I was just coming from a party and I tried to help the man out who...
[02:13:13.896 --> 02:13:18.280]  Unfortunately, he was on a motorcycle and ran in back of a truck.
[02:13:18.541 --> 02:13:19.181]  Didn't survive.
[02:13:19.241 --> 02:13:22.664]  You stopped to help a guy and you maybe had a few drinks?
[02:13:23.425 --> 02:13:26.167]  And I was waiting there, waiting for somebody to come.
[02:13:27.985 --> 02:13:44.557]  One of the guys who showed up was an off-duty police officer, so I went and sat near my car, you know, and pretty soon they blocked the whole freeway off, and then pretty soon they're arresting me, threw me in jail, and in the police report they said they pulled me over, and, you know, I was kind of like... So what happened?
[02:13:44.577 --> 02:13:45.138]  Did you fight it?
[02:13:46.659 --> 02:13:51.983]  I fought it, but, you know, they actually, like you, they gave me a breathalyzer and...
[02:13:52.992 --> 02:13:57.856]  At the time I was, you know... Well, no, folks, don't take the breathalyzer, okay?
[02:13:57.896 --> 02:13:58.176]  Yeah.
[02:13:58.416 --> 02:14:10.966]  You might end up in Gitmo, but that is your right to refuse the breathalyzer, the blood test, or anything else until they have the legal warrants in order to take that from you, and you need to talk to your lawyer before you do anything.
[02:14:11.026 --> 02:14:12.767]  But now I guess you've learned that the hard way.
[02:14:13.211 --> 02:14:18.639]  I learned that the hard way, but I just stay away from drinking, period.
[02:14:19.099 --> 02:14:22.504]  And what happens the next time you see somebody stranded by the side of the road?
[02:14:22.524 --> 02:14:23.686]  Are you going to pull over and help them?
[02:14:24.086 --> 02:14:25.188]  I'll still help them.
[02:14:25.288 --> 02:14:25.949]  I bet you would.
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:34.467]  I can't, you know, it's like with Ron Pauls, you know, I wouldn't mind being, I've worked in security, so I wouldn't mind taking a bullet for that man either, so.
[02:14:34.787 --> 02:14:36.888]  Well, I think we can all agree with you on that.
[02:14:36.908 --> 02:14:41.292]  Well, he'll be joining us here in just about 15 minutes, and we'll lay it all out for you.
[02:14:41.332 --> 02:14:43.194]  Robert, thanks for the call, and thanks for hanging in there.
[02:14:43.214 --> 02:14:46.576]  Keep the faith, okay, in the police state of California.
[02:14:46.937 --> 02:14:48.778]  Let's go to Paul in Pennsylvania.
[02:14:48.818 --> 02:14:49.759]  Paul, thank you for calling.
[02:14:49.779 --> 02:14:50.760]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:52.481]  We're taking a record amount of calls today.
[02:14:52.701 --> 02:14:53.542]  I'm really enjoying it.
[02:14:53.582 --> 02:14:54.483]  Paul, thank you for joining us.
[02:14:54.503 --> 02:14:54.883]  You're on the air.
[02:14:55.362 --> 02:14:59.045]  All right, thank you for letting me on, and thank you for providing the info or with us.
[02:15:00.146 --> 02:15:01.647]  My honor.
[02:15:01.727 --> 02:15:03.328]  Yeah, I'm 16 years old.
[02:15:03.488 --> 02:15:23.363]  I'm a sophomore in high school, and I'm really sick of the BS from the teachers trying to literally brainwash us in this sort of Orwellian state, police state, with seriously processes of doublethink, with...
[02:15:25.612 --> 02:15:29.854]  And the kids, they're seriously neocon Bushites.
[02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:38.179]  I was sitting in my study hall, and some kids are like, oh, no, this 9-11 stuff's all BS.
[02:15:38.239 --> 02:15:40.200]  And I'm like, no, it's not.
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:41.901]  And I started asking them questions, you know.
[02:15:42.482 --> 02:15:48.045]  What about the 10 explosions between 930 and 950 that are unaccounted for?
[02:15:49.165 --> 02:15:52.107]  Dust clouds coming from the base.
[02:15:52.207 --> 02:15:53.728]  Marble panels falling off.
[02:15:54.547 --> 02:16:07.752]  I don't know if your teachers would even have answers to any of those things, but you dared to ask the questions.
[02:16:08.132 --> 02:16:10.933]  Well, I was asking these kids, and you know what they did?
[02:16:11.313 --> 02:16:11.893]  They sat there.
[02:16:12.253 --> 02:16:14.194]  I piled about ten questions on them.
[02:16:14.714 --> 02:16:16.555]  They sat there, and they're like, uh, well...
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:18.560]  Skeptics.
[02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:20.541]  They completely changed the subject.
[02:16:20.821 --> 02:16:25.082]  They just said there, they said, oh, well... Can you put it in the form of a video game, Paul?
[02:16:26.042 --> 02:16:26.662]  What do you mean?
[02:16:27.703 --> 02:16:35.465]  I'm saying you'd probably reach these people much more efficiently if you can put your information into the form of a video game.
[02:16:36.405 --> 02:16:37.805]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:16:38.626 --> 02:16:39.426]  Yeah, they're all...
[02:16:41.496 --> 02:16:42.137]  They sicken me.
[02:16:42.417 --> 02:16:43.678]  I can't stand it.
[02:16:43.698 --> 02:16:45.719]  Don't get discouraged, Paul.
[02:16:45.999 --> 02:16:49.582]  We had a young lady call into the program just a couple of days ago.
[02:16:50.382 --> 02:16:55.005]  The same advice I'm giving you is, look, you're going to be the cool one.
[02:16:55.226 --> 02:16:58.208]  Let's remember that life isn't high school, okay, folks?
[02:16:58.248 --> 02:17:06.213]  I don't know how many people your age we have listening, but nothing you do in high school really matters when you move on to everyday life.
[02:17:06.273 --> 02:17:08.054]  So protecting your...
[02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:12.431]  Popularity or whatever is not important.
[02:17:12.471 --> 02:17:19.532]  What is important is doing what's right, and your fellow classmates will admire you for it and respect you for it.
[02:17:19.572 --> 02:17:20.453]  Believe me, Paul.
[02:17:20.513 --> 02:17:23.233]  Put together an organization at your school.
[02:17:23.273 --> 02:17:24.854]  Get one or two people.
[02:17:25.174 --> 02:17:26.674]  It will catch on like fire.
[02:17:26.734 --> 02:17:31.535]  People will see how fun it is, and you'll be the one that can pull that off.
[02:17:31.735 --> 02:17:32.856]  Only you, probably, Paul.
[02:17:32.996 --> 02:17:33.856]  I hope you'll do that, man.
[02:17:34.778 --> 02:17:39.048]  Any of you kids out there, you want to know how to do that, write me, and I'll do the best I can to help you.
[02:17:39.069 --> 02:17:40.231]  We'll be right back after this, folks.
[02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:41.895]  More phone calls on the Alex Jones Show.

[02:17:44.764 --> 02:17:49.845]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:17:49.905 --> 02:17:57.207]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:17:57.367 --> 02:18:07.969]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:18:08.189 --> 02:18:12.730]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:18:13.010 --> 02:18:17.996]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:18:18.217 --> 02:18:21.161]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:21.381 --> 02:18:30.913]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:18:30.913 --> 02:18:32.694]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:32.734 --> 02:18:37.777]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[02:18:55.982 --> 02:19:03.344]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, V.I.
[02:19:03.424 --> 02:19:04.065]  Lenin, on them.
[02:19:04.945 --> 02:19:09.626]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[02:19:10.227 --> 02:19:14.188]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.
[02:19:14.648 --> 02:19:15.068]  We're good to go.
[02:19:15.108 --> 02:19:15.589]  We're good to go.
[02:19:46.038 --> 02:19:49.720]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[02:19:53.002 --> 02:19:56.424]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:19:56.484 --> 02:19:58.346]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[02:19:58.946 --> 02:20:04.569]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:20:14.264 --> 02:20:19.888]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[02:20:20.509 --> 02:20:23.531]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:20:24.091 --> 02:20:29.235]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:30.536 --> 02:20:34.479]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:38.082]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[02:20:38.542 --> 02:20:39.943]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.992 --> 02:20:48.955]  I found this company online, and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[02:20:49.176 --> 02:20:52.698]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:20:52.999 --> 02:20:57.082]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[02:20:57.362 --> 02:20:58.303]  I was so amazed.
[02:20:58.543 --> 02:21:01.366]  I put it in the baby's room, and it made a perfect nightlight.
[02:21:01.586 --> 02:21:03.467]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:21:03.848 --> 02:21:09.032]  SoliWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:21:09.512 --> 02:21:15.415]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[02:21:15.695 --> 02:21:17.416]  I figured it would clean really well.
[02:21:17.676 --> 02:21:20.858]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[02:21:21.038 --> 02:21:24.940]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:26.561]  Plus, the service was great.
[02:21:27.001 --> 02:21:32.143]  If you're interested in natural, homeopathic, time-tested remedies, visit SolayWellness.com.
[02:21:32.183 --> 02:21:35.344]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness.com.

[02:21:35.984 --> 02:21:36.024]  312-224-2710.
[02:22:13.603 --> 02:22:14.884]  Hope you're enjoying the show.
[02:22:15.605 --> 02:22:17.528]  Well, not the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:17.828 --> 02:22:24.977]  I hope that the elite are enjoying the movie that has become life in this matrix as they are watching our every move.
[02:22:25.057 --> 02:22:28.642]  And as we often suggest, turn the cameras around.
[02:22:29.537 --> 02:22:36.704]  Expose the elite for what they've done to us lo these last hundred years, let alone the millennia.
[02:22:37.125 --> 02:22:39.207]  They don't have a divine right to rule.
[02:22:39.227 --> 02:22:43.011]  They don't have a divine right to lord over us, though they may think it.
[02:22:43.624 --> 02:22:45.305]  Time to turn those cameras around.
[02:22:45.525 --> 02:22:47.886]  Ron Paul allegedly joining us here in just about five minutes.
[02:22:48.226 --> 02:22:49.947]  We're going to take a few calls, rapid fire.
[02:22:50.027 --> 02:22:53.468]  We're going to do about ten minutes with Ron Paul, and we're going to take ten minutes of your phone calls.
[02:22:53.768 --> 02:22:57.029]  Everything will have to go rapid fire to get as many people as possible.
[02:22:57.049 --> 02:22:57.910]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:57.970 --> 02:23:03.072]  Johnny in Vancouver quickly put something on the record.
[02:23:03.612 --> 02:23:09.354]  Hey there, I'd like to invite people in the Vancouver, Canada area to a couple screenings we're going to be doing.
[02:23:09.958 --> 02:23:13.501]  Out here for America, Freedom to Fascism and Terror Storm.
[02:23:14.722 --> 02:23:21.668]  Freedom to Fascism will be Sunday, January 28th and January 30th, and Terror Storm will be screened on February 4th.
[02:23:23.037 --> 02:23:30.642]  If there's any info you want on this, you can go to my blog at info-warriors.com.
[02:23:31.102 --> 02:23:32.683]  Info-warriors.com.
[02:23:32.723 --> 02:23:37.106]  If you happen to be in Vancouver, the Pacific Northwest, I know you guys show a lot of films and you do a lot of good work up there.
[02:23:37.146 --> 02:23:38.667]  Johnny, I wish I had more time to talk to you.
[02:23:39.027 --> 02:23:40.468]  Keep up the good work, okay?
[02:23:40.728 --> 02:23:41.488]  Thank you for calling.
[02:23:41.568 --> 02:23:42.649]  Rita in Illinois.
[02:23:42.729 --> 02:23:43.870]  Put something on the record, Rita.
[02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.711]  Hi, Jack.
[02:23:45.791 --> 02:23:47.792]  Yeah, a lot of sensitive men calling in today.
[02:23:47.812 --> 02:23:49.013]  They're very sorry about things.
[02:23:49.073 --> 02:23:49.533]  But you know what?
[02:23:49.884 --> 02:23:53.727]  I'm calling about a show Gary Brownfield had the other day about the importance of your sheriff.
[02:23:53.747 --> 02:23:55.489]  Did you know he has more power than your governor?
[02:23:55.529 --> 02:23:58.111]  Could you imagine Deputy Alex Jones?
[02:23:58.151 --> 02:24:00.373]  Could you imagine Deputy Davon Clyde?
[02:24:01.514 --> 02:24:04.876]  Joe Arpaio deputized the whole frickin' county out there.
[02:24:04.896 --> 02:24:05.337]  Yeah.
[02:24:05.677 --> 02:24:06.758]  And you could do that, too.
[02:24:07.178 --> 02:24:15.385]  The sheriff is really... They're trying to eradicate the sheriff and the deputy and take their power away here, which, as you say correctly, they have the power.
[02:24:15.585 --> 02:24:17.166]  Well, move for the sheriff.
[02:24:17.527 --> 02:24:17.707]  Yeah.
[02:24:18.328 --> 02:24:19.168]  Thank you, Rita.
[02:24:19.268 --> 02:24:19.869]  Thank you, Rita.
[02:24:19.909 --> 02:24:20.589]  Good comment.
[02:24:20.629 --> 02:24:20.909]  Thank you.
[02:24:20.929 --> 02:24:21.429]  Appreciate it.
[02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:23.150]  Peggy in Pennsylvania.
[02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:24.411]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:24.431 --> 02:24:25.291]  Put something on the record.
[02:24:25.571 --> 02:24:25.832]  Hi.
[02:24:26.272 --> 02:24:33.295]  I heard Alex say once that after a certain date, you're going to have to have a driver's license and the federal ID in order to board an airplane.
[02:24:33.435 --> 02:24:33.815]  Of course.
[02:24:34.175 --> 02:24:35.096]  Do you know when that will be?
[02:24:36.127 --> 02:24:39.149]  Well, I assume it will be in coordination with the Real ID Act.
[02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:43.813]  I would probably look for that to become mandatory sometime in 2008 if we don't stop it.
[02:24:43.833 --> 02:24:48.997]  The illusion is that you need to have a driver's license or identification to get on a plane now.
[02:24:49.317 --> 02:24:55.282]  That's not true, but you will have to go through some extensive searching and frisking and...
[02:24:55.902 --> 02:24:57.243]  Well, first of all, you have to get a new passport.
[02:24:57.263 --> 02:24:58.945]  Everybody will have to have a new biometric passport.
[02:24:59.005 --> 02:25:01.367]  So if you don't want any of this, you're going to be inconvenienced.
[02:25:01.387 --> 02:25:02.107]  That's for sure.
[02:25:24.512 --> 02:25:25.252]  Okay, thank you.
[02:25:25.312 --> 02:25:25.673]  Thank you.
[02:25:25.733 --> 02:25:29.094]  I mean, but look, if enough of us do it, they'll have to change the laws.
[02:25:29.634 --> 02:25:31.015]  Real quick, I've got to get this in.
[02:25:31.035 --> 02:25:33.136]  I just got a letter from Sal Costello.
[02:25:33.176 --> 02:25:40.719]  The Campo meeting tonight here in Austin, Texas, that was very, very important about Phase 2 toll roads, has been postponed.
[02:25:40.839 --> 02:25:41.159]  All right?
[02:25:41.619 --> 02:25:43.220]  So don't risk your life going down there.
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:44.500]  It's not going to happen.
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:48.081]  It has been postponed until Monday, January 22nd.
[02:25:48.201 --> 02:25:49.962]  Same place, same time.
[02:25:49.982 --> 02:25:51.682]  So again, the Campo meeting is off.
[02:25:51.702 --> 02:25:52.502]  Thanks, Sal, for that.
[02:25:52.742 --> 02:25:54.163]  Same place, same time this Monday.
[02:25:54.183 --> 02:25:56.023]  We'll give you more information on that as it goes.
[02:25:56.063 --> 02:26:00.205]  But tonight, the Campo meeting for Phase 2, the Phase 2 vote is off.
[02:26:00.545 --> 02:26:00.865]  Okay?
[02:26:00.885 --> 02:26:01.505]  And that's official.
[02:26:01.525 --> 02:26:02.265]  We'll announce that again.
[02:26:02.625 --> 02:26:05.986]  Laura in Colorado, you'll be our tail gunner here in this segment.
[02:26:06.006 --> 02:26:06.847]  Put something on the record.
[02:26:07.967 --> 02:26:11.268]  Well, I'm already starting to campaign for Ron Paul up here.
[02:26:11.997 --> 02:26:25.927]  And I'm going to make some very nice professional signs for the top of my vehicles and so forth because I want his name to become well-known as I drive about and do my job and go to the store and do the things like that.
[02:26:26.307 --> 02:26:31.290]  I tell every construction contractor that I see in every laborer exactly what's going on.
[02:26:31.931 --> 02:26:37.755]  I'm not really in fear for my job as far as getting back to my boss because somebody's got to be out here telling the story.
[02:26:39.135 --> 02:26:39.936]  Laura, I'll tell you what.
[02:26:39.976 --> 02:26:45.184]  If you want to hang on the line, you can talk to Ron Paul himself when he comes up here in the next segment.
[02:26:45.264 --> 02:26:46.306]  You're more than welcome to do so.
[02:26:47.047 --> 02:26:47.627]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:26:47.748 --> 02:26:47.988]  Okay.
[02:26:48.248 --> 02:26:49.650]  Okay, I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:26:49.851 --> 02:26:52.635]  And let everybody else know, you can go ahead and pile in now.
[02:26:53.790 --> 02:26:55.451]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:26:55.591 --> 02:26:59.652]  Ron Paul's office has told us he will be on the air with us here in just a few minutes.
[02:26:59.712 --> 02:27:09.076]  So we'll be talking to him briefly about his campaign, about some of the notices he has given Congress, the media, the country, and the world at large.
[02:27:09.116 --> 02:27:13.258]  His new story, The Irrelevance of Military Victory.
[02:27:13.438 --> 02:27:18.160]  Dr. Ron Paul, cross your fingers, folks, should be with us in the next segment.
[02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:18.520]  Stay tuned.
[02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:19.460]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:21.341]  I'm Jack Blood, InfoWars.com.
[02:27:35.214 --> 02:27:36.094]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.595 --> 02:27:38.215]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.235 --> 02:27:41.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.699 --> 02:27:50.701]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley, and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[02:27:51.061 --> 02:27:54.022]  Since that time, I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[02:27:54.422 --> 02:27:58.304]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with building blocks for good health.
[02:27:58.724 --> 02:28:02.746]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[02:28:03.391 --> 02:28:07.873]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[02:28:08.953 --> 02:28:11.735]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery.
[02:28:12.155 --> 02:28:12.915]  And Jim said no.
[02:28:13.395 --> 02:28:17.697]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others but never been surpassed.
[02:28:18.137 --> 02:28:20.638]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops 4-ounce bottle for only $79.99.
[02:28:22.239 --> 02:28:28.183]  Call the Power Hour at 877-817-9829, 877-817-9829.
[02:28:28.824 --> 02:28:32.126]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula.
[02:28:32.386 --> 02:28:34.608]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[02:28:34.628 --> 02:28:34.908]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:28:34.928 --> 02:28:37.690]  Now you can really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:49.000]  Pinch me, Bill.
[02:28:49.281 --> 02:28:50.221]  I can't believe it.
[02:28:50.661 --> 02:28:53.483]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[02:28:53.843 --> 02:28:56.404]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[02:28:56.424 --> 02:28:58.565]  I know what you mean, John.
[02:28:58.585 --> 02:29:02.727]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[02:29:03.308 --> 02:29:07.110]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:08.790]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[02:29:09.231 --> 02:29:14.153]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[02:29:14.433 --> 02:29:15.494]  And I owe it all to you.
[02:29:16.074 --> 02:29:19.375]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:29:19.455 --> 02:29:22.496]  Hey, John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[02:29:22.516 --> 02:29:27.437]  I want to tell everybody, because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[02:29:27.797 --> 02:29:29.477]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[02:29:29.757 --> 02:29:32.398]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[02:29:32.518 --> 02:29:38.740]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:39.820]  What a concept!
[02:29:45.455 --> 02:29:46.216]  Thanks for watching!
[02:30:01.567 --> 02:30:02.328]  We're good to go.
[02:30:17.790 --> 02:30:18.010]  That's 888-216-2461.
[02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:18.330]  Do it today.
[02:31:08.411 --> 02:31:11.894]  We are still waiting for Congressman Paul to join us, hopefully here any minute.
[02:31:11.914 --> 02:31:18.140]  I want to cover this editorial that he published yesterday.
[02:31:20.142 --> 02:31:23.505]  The irrelevance of military victory.
[02:31:23.525 --> 02:31:31.773]  In other words, it's not even relevant if we have a military victory, depending on how you define victory.
[02:31:33.291 --> 02:31:38.735]  He goes on to say, a military victory in Iraq is unattainable, just as it was in the Vietnam War.
[02:31:39.856 --> 02:31:48.382]  At the close of the Vietnam War in 1975, a telling conversation took place between an NVA colonel named Tu and an American colonel named Harry Summers.
[02:31:48.422 --> 02:31:53.226]  Colonel Summers reportedly said, quote, You never beat us on the battlefield.
[02:31:53.286 --> 02:31:56.208]  Tu replied, That may be so, but it's also irrelevant.
[02:31:57.289 --> 02:32:00.752]  It is likewise irrelevant to seek a military victory in Iraq.
[02:32:01.957 --> 02:32:13.183]  As conditions deteriorate in Iraq, the American people are told more blood must be spilled to achieve just such a military victory.
[02:32:13.203 --> 02:32:21.308]  20,000 additional troops and another $100 billion are needed for a quote-unquote surge, yet the people remain rightfully skeptical.
[02:32:22.529 --> 02:32:28.412]  Though we've been in Iraq nearly four years, the meager goal today simply is to secure Baghdad.
[02:32:29.187 --> 02:32:33.370]  This hardly shows that the mission is even partly accomplished.
[02:32:34.210 --> 02:32:54.402]  Astonishingly, American taxpayers now will be forced to finance a multi-billion dollar jobs program in Iraq, which, I've got to say, is probably the best idea yet, maybe the only good idea, though I'm sure it is insult to injury, folks, when we've been paying all this money so far and getting nothing in the way of results.
[02:32:55.393 --> 02:32:58.018]  He goes on to say, Suddenly the war is about jobs.
[02:32:58.138 --> 02:33:03.527]  We export our manufacturing jobs to Asia, and now we plan to export our welfare jobs to Iraq.
[02:33:03.768 --> 02:33:04.249]  Good point.
[02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:08.276]  All at the expense of the poor and the middle class here at home.
[02:33:09.178 --> 02:33:09.698]  We're good to go.
[02:33:09.718 --> 02:33:10.319]  We're good to go.
[02:33:33.388 --> 02:33:43.473]  Yet no one complains that Mahdi or Kurdish militias or the Badr Brigade, the real Iraqi government, not our appointed government, are not well trained.
[02:33:45.214 --> 02:33:52.178]  Our problem obviously has nothing to do with training Iraqis to fight, but instead with loyalties and motivations.
[02:33:53.438 --> 02:34:02.163]  We claim to be spreading democracy in Iraq, but Sadr has far more democratic support with the majority of Shiites than our troops enjoy.
[02:34:03.303 --> 02:34:06.766]  The problem is not lack of democratic consensus.
[02:34:07.706 --> 02:34:17.013]  It's the antipathy towards our presence among the most, I would consider this almost all Iraqis.
[02:34:18.277 --> 02:34:22.218]  In real estate, the three important considerations are location, location, location.
[02:34:22.758 --> 02:34:26.679]  In Iraq, the three conditions are occupation, occupation, occupation.
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:33.841]  Nothing can improve in Iraq until we understand that our occupation is the primary source of the chaos and the killing.
[02:34:35.002 --> 02:34:39.923]  We are a foreign occupying force strongly resented by the majority.
[02:34:40.803 --> 02:34:41.804]  It's a democracy.
[02:34:43.204 --> 02:34:46.025]  By the majority of Iraq citizens.
[02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:53.615]  Our inability to adapt to the tactics of the fourth generation warfare compounds our military failure.
[02:34:53.976 --> 02:35:02.502]  Unless we understand this, even doubting or doubling our true strength will not solve the problems created by our occupation.
[02:35:02.823 --> 02:35:10.369]  The talk of a troop surge and jobs program in Iraq only distracts Americans from the real possibility of an attack on Iran.
[02:35:11.829 --> 02:35:12.510]  We're good to go.
[02:35:34.344 --> 02:35:38.767]  Iran will be bombed by either Israel or the United States, possibly with nuclear weapons.
[02:35:39.408 --> 02:35:51.236]  Our CIA says Iran is 10 years away from producing a nuclear bomb and has no delivery system, but this does not impede our plans to keep everything on the table, quote unquote, when dealing with Iran.
[02:35:51.836 --> 02:35:57.798]  We should remember that Iran, like Iraq, is a third world nation without significant military.
[02:35:57.878 --> 02:36:05.261]  Nothing in history hints that she is likely to invade a neighboring country, let alone do anything to America or Israel.
[02:36:06.481 --> 02:36:13.884]  I am concerned, however, that a contrived Gulf of Tonkin-type incident might occur to gain popular support for an attack on Iran.
[02:36:14.915 --> 02:36:18.239]  Even if such an attack is carried out by Israel over U.S.
[02:36:18.319 --> 02:36:25.807]  objections, we will be politically and morally culpable, since we provided the weapons and dollars to make it possible.
[02:36:27.068 --> 02:36:28.570]  Let's hope I'm wrong about this.
[02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:35.778]  And I think it would be safe to say, we all hope you're wrong about this, Congressman Paul.
[02:36:37.305 --> 02:36:50.954]  I would also like to say that I hope I'm wrong about the majority of my research over the many, many years we've been out researching and fighting the Infowar regarding 9-11, domestic spying, and all of the rest.
[02:36:50.994 --> 02:37:04.182]  The coming North American Union, which is now being taught to professors at ASU and to students at ASU, they're being conditioned that we're North Americans, we're not Americans, we're international citizens and not citizens of the United States.
[02:37:04.981 --> 02:37:18.229]  That we don't have rights, we have privileges, and we do have to have some kind of blessing by the government in order to even enjoy the God-given inalienable rights that we should have.
[02:37:19.330 --> 02:37:20.751]  Say that word three times fast.
[02:37:20.811 --> 02:37:24.794]  It's hard, folks, especially in the middle of a sentence when you're ad-libbing on a talk radio program.
[02:37:26.094 --> 02:37:29.276]  So yes, I hope you're wrong about an attack on Iran.
[02:37:29.296 --> 02:37:33.219]  I think that will be, if we're not already there already, it will be the beginning of the end.
[02:37:35.255 --> 02:37:36.516]  And I hope we're wrong about all this.
[02:37:36.876 --> 02:37:42.040]  Unfortunately, the record shows we've been right the majority of the time.
[02:37:42.540 --> 02:37:44.482]  We do have Congressman Paul with us.
[02:37:44.942 --> 02:37:46.243]  Needs no introduction.
[02:37:46.883 --> 02:37:49.625]  Ron Paul, Dr. Paul, thank you for joining us on the program today.
[02:37:49.685 --> 02:37:55.709]  I know we're limited on time, but a lot of people really wanting to pat you on the back for throwing your hat in the ring for the 08 elections.
[02:37:55.769 --> 02:37:56.450]  Welcome to the program.
[02:37:56.470 --> 02:37:57.150]  Well, thank you.
[02:37:57.170 --> 02:37:57.911]  It's nice to be with you.
[02:37:58.863 --> 02:38:00.244]  And is that official?
[02:38:00.304 --> 02:38:06.890]  I know you're doing an exploratory committee, but we assume that this is going out in a full-fledged presidential campaign.
[02:38:07.571 --> 02:38:10.614]  It's official that the exploratory committee has been filed.
[02:38:11.635 --> 02:38:15.538]  The information was put into the public a little sooner than we thought.
[02:38:15.618 --> 02:38:21.464]  We thought that we would have a little time to prepare and make a formal announcement, but it got out there last week and...
[02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:30.343]  Are you surprised at the overwhelming support you already have and how excited people are to have you in these debates and have you part of this process?
[02:38:30.363 --> 02:38:31.844]  To tell you the truth, I am.
[02:38:32.484 --> 02:38:50.531]  There are others who are more optimistic than myself and therefore it's very encouraging because running a campaign like ours will be, you don't get the tens of millions of dollars that the establishment politicians will get, but in this day and age with the internet and radio programs and
[02:38:51.268 --> 02:38:56.101]  And shortwave, you know, there's a lot of people out there that we don't know about.
[02:38:56.789 --> 02:38:58.930]  Hopefully the surprises will keep coming.
[02:38:59.410 --> 02:39:12.933]  Dr. Paul, I think that your Internet campaign, your grassroots efforts, which we've already had just tons and tons of people write in and call in to say that they're going to support, will eclipse what Howard Dean did in the last election.
[02:39:12.973 --> 02:39:16.794]  And obviously you're coming from the position of being an honest broker.
[02:39:16.854 --> 02:39:19.334]  And I think this is something that can really be contagious to America.
[02:39:19.614 --> 02:39:22.255]  Why did you decide ultimately to jump in the ring here?
[02:39:23.430 --> 02:39:34.743]  I think it was the... I think the election had something to do with it, because it to me looked like the Republicans have awakened to a degree and said, enough is enough.
[02:39:35.399 --> 02:39:39.620]  Doesn't mean they've had a conversion yet, but at least they're getting pretty annoyed.
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:49.403]  Of course, I've been annoyed all along with our foreign policy, as well as the Republican acceptance of increasing entitlement programs and not caring about the deficit.
[02:39:49.423 --> 02:39:51.564]  So the Republicans have lost their way.
[02:39:51.664 --> 02:39:54.705]  So I think there are people waking up in this country.
[02:39:54.765 --> 02:40:03.748]  I don't know how much we can do to save the Republican Party, but at least that's the vehicle that I'm using right now, and hopefully enough people will consider the Republican...
[02:40:04.855 --> 02:40:16.683]  Yeah, I think there are obviously going to be people out there that automatically see the word or the title Republican and they're going to run with their pants on fire as far away as they can get.
[02:40:16.903 --> 02:40:18.765]  And obviously we're not going to be targeting those people.
[02:40:18.805 --> 02:40:34.155]  But I think as your campaign unfolds and people start hearing this, we're going to start tapping in, Dr. Paul, to the 100 million or so people who don't vote in this country, who have no interest in the political process, and who have potentially given up altogether.
[02:40:35.155 --> 02:40:38.756]  And there's a ton of them, and a lot of people just call them apathetic.
[02:40:38.816 --> 02:40:52.079]  But, you know, if it's in the calculated person who has analyzed the situation, came to the conclusion that, you know, there is no difference, and they make a deliberate choice not to vote, I would say it is a vote.
[02:40:52.279 --> 02:40:56.580]  It's a vote of non-acceptance of what they've been offered.
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:40:59.921]  So there are some people who are apathetic, and they don't know what's going on.
[02:40:59.961 --> 02:41:01.781]  But I think there's a lot of people like you described –
[02:41:02.489 --> 02:41:07.192]  They're just sick of the mess, and they don't participate, and maybe if we can energize them, they will.
[02:41:07.532 --> 02:41:09.694]  Now, Dr. Paul, are you a member of Skull and Bones?
[02:41:10.414 --> 02:41:12.876]  No, I've been waiting on my invitation.
[02:41:13.517 --> 02:41:15.238]  Are you a member of the Bilderberg Group?
[02:41:15.818 --> 02:41:19.040]  No, maybe now that I've announced, I'll get an invitation.
[02:41:20.141 --> 02:41:20.401]  Right.
[02:41:20.541 --> 02:41:24.084]  Or a bilateral agreement, or CRP, CRS, and all that.
[02:41:24.164 --> 02:41:25.365]  I haven't joined any of those yet.
[02:41:25.945 --> 02:41:39.756]  We just covered your story, the irrelevance of military victory, which also segues into the speech you gave, I believe, in front of Congress, which was aired on C-SPAN, talking about the fact that Iran can bring about the next Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[02:41:40.197 --> 02:41:42.198]  I'd like you just to comment on that briefly, if you could.
[02:41:42.479 --> 02:41:51.566]  Well, this is what I fear, is that although the American people have spoken out in the election, they're tired of Iraq, and they certainly wouldn't endorse spreading the war.
[02:41:52.090 --> 02:41:52.511]  We're good to go.
[02:41:52.531 --> 02:41:52.731]  I think?
[02:42:06.482 --> 02:42:13.166]  Which means that they would like to spread the word, and yet the people won't accept this unless there's justification.
[02:42:13.286 --> 02:42:14.807]  You know, there has to be a reason.
[02:42:15.248 --> 02:42:26.735]  And that's why we should be leery of any kind of an incident that pops up and some Americans get killed and say, see, we told you it was all due to the Iranians, and therefore we have to, you know, go and attack.
[02:42:26.795 --> 02:42:30.718]  And they're probably not planning because they've run out of troops and run out of
[02:42:31.178 --> 02:42:31.679]  We're good to go.
[02:42:46.543 --> 02:42:54.906]  And they're liable to use that, but that's going to just infuriate another group of people, you know, and just make us more vulnerable than ever.
[02:42:55.226 --> 02:42:59.227]  Yeah, as General Tony McPeak once told me, he ran the air campaign from the Gulf War.
[02:42:59.267 --> 02:43:01.327]  We're creating terrorists faster than we can kill them.
[02:43:01.367 --> 02:43:04.748]  That was two years ago, and I don't think we've done anything to alleviate that.
[02:43:04.968 --> 02:43:06.669]  How was that speech received in Congress?
[02:43:07.558 --> 02:43:08.758]  It was pretty well ignored.
[02:43:10.799 --> 02:43:13.119]  But, you know, my friends listen and they pay attention.
[02:43:13.139 --> 02:43:16.060]  And we have a small little group on our side.
[02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:19.180]  And there's a small group of Democrats who are honest with this issue.
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:20.840]  And I get encouragement.
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:27.221]  But the biggest response comes from, you know, outside of Washington, the people who happen to catch it on the Internet or on C-SPAN.
[02:43:27.862 --> 02:43:30.722]  And that, of course, is what we need.
[02:43:30.942 --> 02:43:32.142]  We need encouragement.
[02:43:32.162 --> 02:43:35.783]  I don't think there's much chance of us really converting Washington, D.C.,
[02:43:36.536 --> 02:43:46.342]  We just need to get the American people activated and willing to send a message up here so that either the members start changing their ways or they'll have new members up here.
[02:43:46.582 --> 02:43:50.564]  Well, I mean, you told us what to look for, and I'm glad you said that, and I'm glad it was on C-SPAN.
[02:43:50.604 --> 02:43:52.525]  I'm glad it's circulating heavily around the Internet.
[02:43:53.766 --> 02:44:09.838]  Gulf of Tonkin comparison speech regarding Iran, and I hope people are waking up to the possibility that this could happen, and if it does happen, and we're told that this, again, is the pretext to go into war and move into the next theater, that people remember what you said and question the information that we're given.
[02:44:10.098 --> 02:44:17.783]  Dr. Paul, I wanted to take a few calls, because I know a lot of people are anxious to talk to you and give you the warm and fuzzy, so to speak, and you were a little late.
[02:44:17.803 --> 02:44:20.085]  I don't know if you'll be able to stay a little bit longer than the end of this segment.
[02:44:20.105 --> 02:44:21.706]  I think I can handle five more minutes.
[02:44:21.906 --> 02:44:22.226]  Okay.
[02:44:22.246 --> 02:44:22.986]  Well, let's do it now.
[02:44:23.026 --> 02:44:25.387]  Let's at least give a couple of callers a chance to talk to you.
[02:44:25.407 --> 02:44:26.267]  I know they've all been waiting.
[02:44:26.787 --> 02:44:27.247]  Let's see.
[02:44:27.267 --> 02:44:28.547]  Do we have John in Texas?
[02:44:28.587 --> 02:44:29.268]  John, are you with us?
[02:44:30.748 --> 02:44:30.988]  Yeah.
[02:44:31.008 --> 02:44:31.508]  Hi, Jack.
[02:44:31.548 --> 02:44:32.308]  Hi, Dr. Paul.
[02:44:32.368 --> 02:44:32.708]  Hello.
[02:44:33.868 --> 02:44:34.949]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[02:44:35.769 --> 02:44:39.670]  I would like to plug a website that I know Alex and Jack knows about.
[02:44:39.890 --> 02:44:43.990]  It's called voter-smart.org.
[02:44:44.871 --> 02:44:51.592]  And I'm using this website to contact all of the members of the 110th Congress, including all the 50 senators.
[02:44:52.222 --> 02:44:54.765]  And Dr. Paul, I sent you a letter today.
[02:44:54.785 --> 02:44:57.007]  I'm going to read you one sentence from it.
[02:44:57.868 --> 02:45:06.676]  And it says that, I want a complete, impartial, and totally independent investigation on the events of September 11, 2001.
[02:45:06.816 --> 02:45:10.780]  I'm tired of this bogus garbage about terrorism.
[02:45:11.421 --> 02:45:15.745]  Ask Michael Meacher about how he feels about this bogus war on terrorism.
[02:45:16.226 --> 02:45:17.467]  Can you comment on that, please?
[02:45:17.828 --> 02:45:20.170]  Well, that would be nice to have.
[02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:23.913]  Unfortunately, we don't have that in place.
[02:45:23.973 --> 02:45:28.037]  It'll be a little bit better with the Democrats now in charge of oversight.
[02:45:28.644 --> 02:45:33.886]  But, you know, for top-level policy, there's not a whole lot of difference between the two policies.
[02:45:33.926 --> 02:45:37.887]  So a real investigation isn't going to happen.
[02:45:37.907 --> 02:45:39.728]  But I think we have to keep pushing for it.
[02:45:40.328 --> 02:45:47.511]  And like you and others, we see the investigations that have been done so far is just more or less cover-up.
[02:45:48.084 --> 02:45:49.645]  How are you doing there Mr. Paul?
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:11.761]  Thank God for you.
[02:46:11.841 --> 02:46:13.362]  Now I have somebody I can vote for.
[02:46:14.262 --> 02:46:17.064]  You ought to stay in touch with Lou Dobbs in a way, too.
[02:46:17.144 --> 02:46:19.526]  He could put some good words out about you, I think.
[02:46:19.706 --> 02:46:20.246]  Yeah.
[02:46:20.266 --> 02:46:21.507]  I've been on his show a couple times.
[02:46:22.368 --> 02:46:23.308]  Yes, I know that.
[02:46:23.408 --> 02:46:25.550]  But you need to stay in contact with him.
[02:46:25.650 --> 02:46:32.094]  Something else, too, this black box voting and stuff, I mean, I don't trust the votes at all anymore.
[02:46:32.114 --> 02:46:32.655]  Yeah.
[02:46:32.915 --> 02:46:35.977]  And something else I want to get in real quick, and then I'll let somebody else get on, is that
[02:46:36.909 --> 02:46:42.653]  I'm going to be coming in this few million dollars here pretty quick, and as soon as I do, I'm going to get in contact with you and help you out.
[02:46:43.073 --> 02:46:44.374]  Sounds good.
[02:46:44.434 --> 02:46:45.395]  Thank you for the call, Cliff.
[02:46:45.415 --> 02:46:54.922]  I think people will give you their last dime to try to push your campaign forward and rub their hands to the bone to work for you, and that's what's so exciting that we finally...
[02:46:55.522 --> 02:47:04.907]  Dr. Paul, and I know this is embarrassing for you here, but we really finally have someone we believe in jumping into the process here, and I speak for millions and millions of people around the country.
[02:47:05.547 --> 02:47:08.448]  I'm going to go to Mark in Florida, but real quick, let's get in a website.
[02:47:08.508 --> 02:47:11.870]  Is there a website where people can track the progress of your campaign?
[02:47:12.690 --> 02:47:16.774]  Yes, go to ronpaul.org and it will immediately refer you to another website.
[02:47:16.854 --> 02:47:19.216]  ronpaul.org is the easiest thing to remember.
[02:47:19.336 --> 02:47:20.317]  ronpaul.org.
[02:47:20.417 --> 02:47:22.719]  Mark in Florida, final word for Ron Paul.
[02:47:22.739 --> 02:47:23.679]  Go ahead, make it quick, please.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:30.265]  Yeah, Dr. Paul, I was just calling and so many people, you know, they run on a campaign, they say they're going to change this and they're going to change that.
[02:47:30.765 --> 02:47:32.807]  What's going to take you and set you aside?
[02:47:33.271 --> 02:47:37.535]  From these guys, after they get in, they're like Bush and all these people, and they don't do what they say.
[02:47:37.775 --> 02:47:39.576]  What can you tell the American people?
[02:47:40.137 --> 02:47:49.585]  Well, I guess all you can do is look at my record and see if I do what I said that I would do, and I think pretty much I've stuck to that, and get credit for it.
[02:47:49.645 --> 02:47:55.110]  But to tell you the truth, I, as an individual, can't change the country.
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:48:00.641]  We can lead, we can suggest, we can get it, but only the people can accept it.
[02:48:00.701 --> 02:48:09.242]  So if the people still want to go to war and they still want big government socialism, one individual can't do it.
[02:48:09.322 --> 02:48:10.423]  So we have two jobs.
[02:48:10.803 --> 02:48:12.783]  One, getting the political leadership that we need.
[02:48:13.323 --> 02:48:23.125]  Then, of course, doing what this radio station does so well, is get the information out and get our supporters animated and get involved in bringing about these changes.
[02:48:23.465 --> 02:48:24.046]  Well said.
[02:48:24.306 --> 02:48:26.129]  Dr. Paul, I appreciate you making time.
[02:48:26.149 --> 02:48:29.112]  I believe that this is the first interview you've done since you've announced.
[02:48:29.232 --> 02:48:32.877]  We're going to be tracking and working with you throughout this process.
[02:48:32.917 --> 02:48:35.440]  And, of course, you know, if you need anything, just give us a call.
[02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:38.184]  Dr. Ron Paul, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:48:38.204 --> 02:48:41.968]  We'll come back, wrap this up, big finish on the Alex Jones Show coming up right after this, folks.
[02:48:41.988 --> 02:48:42.329]  Stay tuned.
[02:48:48.104 --> 02:48:51.305]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:51.645 --> 02:48:53.565]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:53.945 --> 02:49:01.607]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.267 --> 02:49:09.328]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.729 --> 02:49:12.689]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:13.009 --> 02:49:15.390]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:15.790 --> 02:49:16.630]  NSA spies.

[02:49:44.719 --> 02:49:52.962]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking a hot shower than when you drink the water?
[02:49:53.222 --> 02:49:57.583]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:57.884 --> 02:50:06.787]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[02:50:16.237 --> 02:50:22.989]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[02:51:46.066 --> 02:51:51.228]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:51.888 --> 02:51:54.250]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:54.270 --> 02:52:01.273]  This just in, Ronald McDonald is Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:01.293 --> 02:52:07.376]  We're tracking, our government is tracking Ronald McDonald around the country trying to find him.
[02:52:07.456 --> 02:52:09.917]  It's now been revealed it's a dual identity.
[02:52:10.778 --> 02:52:13.699]  Very sneaky of Osama Bin Goldstein.
[02:52:14.571 --> 02:52:16.071]  McVeigh.
[02:52:16.612 --> 02:52:17.852]  Okay, we're obviously joking.
[02:52:18.912 --> 02:52:24.434]  Final segment of the show, I will be back with Deadline Live for two more hours after this program.
[02:52:24.454 --> 02:52:27.214]  Of course, we're on Monday through Friday, 2 to 4 p.m.
[02:52:27.254 --> 02:52:28.815]  Central Time with Deadline Live.
[02:52:28.855 --> 02:52:33.276]  And it's more of a rock and roll version of this program.
[02:52:33.536 --> 02:52:36.197]  We work heavily with the people in the arts to...
[02:52:37.117 --> 02:52:38.018]  We're good to go.
[02:52:55.018 --> 02:52:56.299]  We're good to go.
[02:52:56.319 --> 02:52:57.400]  We're good to go.
[02:53:10.533 --> 02:53:15.917]  Everyone is working together on this show for years and years and years to make it the success that it is.
[02:53:15.957 --> 02:53:19.699]  And I believe it is one of the most important radio broadcasts in the world today.
[02:53:19.759 --> 02:53:22.621]  So, of course, I'm very honored to be sitting in on the program.
[02:53:22.641 --> 02:53:24.322]  Bob Dacey will join you.
[02:53:24.503 --> 02:53:25.623]  Bob is a great guy.
[02:53:25.683 --> 02:53:27.945]  Really, just like Ron Paul, walks the walk.
[02:53:28.365 --> 02:53:29.546]  He doesn't just talk the talk.
[02:53:29.586 --> 02:53:30.427]  He walks the walk.
[02:53:30.467 --> 02:53:32.228]  He lives what he preaches.
[02:53:33.028 --> 02:53:39.712]  He will be handling the program for the next two days, and then Alex Jones will be back on Monday on fire.
[02:53:39.932 --> 02:53:42.413]  I'm sure nobody will want to miss that Monday broadcast.
[02:53:42.633 --> 02:53:44.655]  Let's just round this out with two more quick calls.
[02:53:44.915 --> 02:53:46.796]  Rick in Reno, you can put something on the record.
[02:53:46.816 --> 02:53:47.516]  Thank you for calling in.
[02:53:48.377 --> 02:53:52.038]  With all due respect to Dr. Paul, I'm not going to vote for him.
[02:53:52.459 --> 02:53:59.543]  I'm going to watch the Democrats very carefully, and if they get the war ended, get all of the troops out of Iraq, I'll vote Democratic.
[02:54:00.103 --> 02:54:00.603]  And if they don't...
[02:54:02.679 --> 02:54:03.600]  Barack Obama.
[02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:06.822]  Okay, well that's your mistake, I have to say, Rick.
[02:54:06.842 --> 02:54:07.502]  Thank you for calling in.
[02:54:07.542 --> 02:54:08.443]  Call back into my show.
[02:54:08.463 --> 02:54:09.784]  I'll debate that with you if you like.
[02:54:10.164 --> 02:54:12.225]  Ken in Ohio, thank you for joining us.
[02:54:12.305 --> 02:54:13.366]  You are on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:14.006 --> 02:54:14.427]  Excellent.
[02:54:14.487 --> 02:54:15.467]  I can't believe I made it.
[02:54:16.588 --> 02:54:17.168]  Two things.
[02:54:17.589 --> 02:54:18.309]  We'll do the latter.
[02:54:22.212 --> 02:54:23.973]  Congressman Paul is still on the air, correct?
[02:54:24.333 --> 02:54:24.773]  No, he's not.
[02:54:25.113 --> 02:54:25.834]  Oh, he's not on the air.
[02:54:26.054 --> 02:54:27.235]  Okay, so we're just going to do one.
[02:54:27.275 --> 02:54:30.357]  Nor will I be speaking for Dr. Paul, but I'll do my best.
[02:54:30.737 --> 02:54:31.538]  No, no, it's okay.
[02:54:31.578 --> 02:54:31.998]  It's okay.
[02:54:32.705 --> 02:54:42.749]  I have this brainstorm to deliver 88 copies of Freedom to Fascism as well as Terror Storm to each and every one of our sheriffs in the state of Ohio.
[02:54:44.449 --> 02:54:59.095]  And I'm curious to know, now I know a half a dozen of the sheriffs myself currently, some in the southern tip of Ohio and the rest in the northern section of Ohio, and I'm curious to know
[02:54:59.747 --> 02:55:02.351]  How effective do you think that attempt will be?
[02:55:02.371 --> 02:55:05.636]  Because it will be a monumental expenditure.
[02:55:05.836 --> 02:55:06.797]  People have been doing it.
[02:55:07.038 --> 02:55:09.441]  I'm probably going to have to cut you off there just because we're out of time.
[02:55:09.481 --> 02:55:11.584]  But people have been doing this.
[02:55:11.644 --> 02:55:14.488]  In fact, some have been arrested for doing so.
[02:55:14.569 --> 02:55:16.111]  And I have to think of Rick Salata.
[02:55:17.194 --> 02:55:31.126]  In Montana with KT Ordinance who went out and gave Alex Jones videos and copies of the Constitution to his sheriffs and the people and the authorities in his county and he was arrested and put under siege for doing so.
[02:55:31.166 --> 02:55:34.348]  So there are risks involved in this, but I don't think there's anything more important.
[02:55:34.649 --> 02:55:38.392]  We have to take away the excuse that they just don't know about this stuff.
[02:55:38.892 --> 02:55:39.872]  That's what we have to do.
[02:55:40.152 --> 02:55:42.613]  And while you're at it, tell them about the Federal Reserve.
[02:55:42.633 --> 02:55:48.235]  In fact, I think Aaron Russo does that pretty well in his movie from Freedom of Fascism, a great, great film.
[02:55:48.255 --> 02:55:49.155]  But keep it up.
[02:55:49.315 --> 02:55:49.955]  Yeah, do that.
[02:55:50.235 --> 02:55:50.495]  Do it.
[02:55:50.555 --> 02:55:51.615]  How effective will it be?
[02:55:51.855 --> 02:55:55.316]  If you get one person on board with you, then it has been effective.
[02:55:55.476 --> 02:55:55.837]  Okay?
[02:55:56.537 --> 02:55:58.137]  We don't have to change the world today.
[02:55:58.177 --> 02:56:00.858]  We'll be back here in about six minutes with Deadline Live.
[02:56:01.058 --> 02:56:03.479]  Thank you so much for joining us on the Alex Jones Show, folks.
