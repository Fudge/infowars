[00:00:01.545 --> 00:00:17.651]  That's how it works a lot of times, is you're doing one investigation on the prosecutor Johnny Sutton, going after innocent Border Patrol agents, and you find yourself in a whole other galaxy of evil.
[00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:26.154]  And systematic, with the CPS and young children right up to teenagers, running the info I have, prostitution, out of these facilities.
[00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:37.689]  He's written a detailed report, embattled AG, now accused in sex scandal cover-up, Attorney General Gonzalez among officials who allegedly ignored abuse of minor boys.
[00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:41.731]  And this is big news in Texas, but they're doing their best job they can to whitewash it.
[00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.612]  Dr. Corsi writing for Roland Daily and Human Events.
[00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:48.414]  Again, we have links up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to this story.
[00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:49.495]  Breakdown for us.
[00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:54.497]  Exactly how, you know, in your research, exactly how bad this is.
[00:00:54.497 --> 00:01:00.818]  You said a pedophile club, you know, have to be a felon, basically, to even join the club.
[00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:04.279]  And it's the same thing in Florida, by the way, folks.
[00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:05.679]  Break this down for us.
[00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:10.220]  Well, Alex, let's make sure everybody listening understands exactly what we're talking about.
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:19.322]  We're talking about, first started in a Texas youth commission correctional facility in Paiote,
[00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:20.776]  West Texas.
[00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:23.999]  It's way out in West Texas by Odessa.
[00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:35.431]  And this facility, the two top people at it were both known felons or criminals or had sexual misconduct in their backgrounds.
[00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:42.479]  One of the two of them even used to like to look at nude pictures of men and women on his state computer at the facility.
[00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:43.742]  I don't know.
[00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.593]  Either to punish them for not participating or maybe because they liked them and wanted to keep them around.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.182]  They have judges who have huge facilities with their name on it when they're still in office.
[00:02:22.182 --> 00:02:23.943]  They're like gods around here.
[00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:28.804]  Literal demigods ruling and worshipped by the people that feed this system.
[00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:35.527]  And what they do is, you get sent to juvie now in this state for the most petty of offenses.
[00:02:35.527 --> 00:02:36.767]  Please continue.
[00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:45.691]  Well, and so these two people, these two administrators were running this facility and running basically a sex club out of it to their own benefit.
[00:02:46.682 --> 00:02:55.249]  And anyone they would hire, anyone throughout the system it turns out, because this is just not located at one facility in Pio, Texas.
[00:02:55.249 --> 00:03:07.878]  But I'm being told by the governor's office today and by the spokesperson brought into the Texas Youth Commission in order to help communicate how they're trying to solve this problem, which is going to be horrendous.
[00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:11.497]  That's called Special Master.
[00:03:11.497 --> 00:03:13.097]  Special Master.
[00:03:13.097 --> 00:03:14.818]  Oh, the Special Master.
[00:03:14.818 --> 00:03:15.178]  It is.
[00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:16.978]  It's a good odd term, isn't it, Alex?
[00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:20.639]  Well, at any rate, this is an entire system-wide problem.
[00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:29.401]  There's over, right now, after they started investigating, and they really only started investigating this at the end of February, so they're less than a month into the investigation.
[00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:31.022]  Thousands of cases.
[00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:31.922]  Thousands of cases.
[00:03:31.922 --> 00:03:35.023]  They've got 1,200 files that have been opened.
[00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:36.683]  They've already made three arrests.
[00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:44.599]  There are dozens statewide of the correctional facility administrators, guards, and other personnel.
[00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.842]  I'm going to tell you right now, folks, as bad as this sounds, it's far worse with the CPFs and those holding facilities.
[00:03:50.842 --> 00:03:55.804]  Well, and they're saying that the staff involved is at the highest to the lowest levels.
[00:03:55.804 --> 00:03:59.225]  Basically sounds like you wouldn't get hired in one of these facilities unless
[00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:01.126]  You were a pedophile.
[00:04:01.126 --> 00:04:03.706]  Jerome, Dr. Corsi... Keep quiet about it.
[00:04:03.706 --> 00:04:05.447]  Dr. Corsi, sorry to interrupt, but I have to add this.
[00:04:05.447 --> 00:04:10.008]  Remember the scandal three or four years ago in Florida with the 3,000 missing kids grabbed by CPS?
[00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:11.049]  Yes, I do remember that.
[00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.789]  And the top three guys were child rapists running it?
[00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.550]  Yes, I remember that very well.
[00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.730]  Now I'm going to shut up and go back.
[00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.951]  Please restate what you said.
[00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:25.793]  Well, what I'm saying here is that you've got a culture of pedophilia that is at the core of the Texas Youth Commission.
[00:04:26.477 --> 00:04:40.400]  And what that means is you won't get hired or you won't stay as an employee of the Texas Youth Commission unless you're willing to participate in the boy rape that's going on or keep quiet about it.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.580]  And that's the whole deal.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:54.143]  It becomes a culture in which all the inmates know, all the employees know, that the whole purpose of these facilities functioning is for sodomy and other sexual abuse
[00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.431]  Of the minor boys who are the inmates.
[00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:59.311]  Now, have you come across the intel?
[00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:07.153]  Because I have somebody working in this office who knows a guard who quit, and this was years ago, because they were prostituting the children out.
[00:05:07.153 --> 00:05:13.354]  Well, you know, Alex, if you could get to me any concrete information on that, I'm now in touch as of today.
[00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:15.094]  Yeah, but these people are all scared, Kev.
[00:05:15.094 --> 00:05:17.275]  Well, just get me anything they can go on.
[00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:23.096]  Okay, well, I'll... You point me in the right direction, I'll get the investigators pointed at it.
[00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:27.278]  Because I've been talking to them all day long since I wrote this article yesterday.
[00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:33.503]  I've been interviewing all the spokesmen for the Texas Youth Commission and the governor's office.
[00:05:33.503 --> 00:05:44.593]  I've got, you know, now several hours... I mean, it's just well known in Texas that a large portion of your state workers that work at these places and the CPS are a giant pedophile ring.
[00:05:44.593 --> 00:05:46.214]  I mean, that's always been known.
[00:05:46.214 --> 00:05:50.998]  And Alex, when you think about it, here you get a boy who's put into one of these facilities
[00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:53.122]  Also, they're incarcerated.
[00:05:53.122 --> 00:05:55.184]  They call it a school, but you're in prison.
[00:05:55.184 --> 00:05:59.567]  And they learn that a bunch of buckets of maggot pus run things.
[00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:16.981]  And you're either going to participate, you know, if you talk about it, if one of these kids, 10 years old, that's the first age they're put in these facilities, up to 19, if you talk about it, if you tell your parents or you tell authorities, you're not going to be believed, you're going to be punished.
[00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:19.903]  It's the kind of thing you can't speak about, and you can't escape.
[00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:31.736]  Now, remember two years ago, tens of thousands of names of pedophiles the police got, but then it turned out that the large portion of them was police and judges, so it got shut down.
[00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:32.416]  Remember that?
[00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:34.077]  Yes, I do.
[00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:35.317]  Folks, we're dead meat.
[00:06:35.317 --> 00:06:36.378]  The country's gone.
[00:06:36.378 --> 00:06:38.459]  Jerome, I don't even know why we're even talking about it now.
[00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:40.200]  I mean, Satan runs things.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.501]  We're now living in fruitcake land.
[00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:47.203]  Well, Alex, you've got a Texas Ranger in this thing, a guy named Brian Brzezinski.
[00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:56.219]  He is out there in West Texas and somebody comes into his office or calls him and complains about the sexual abuse going on.
[00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:57.820]  And he investigates it.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.941]  He creates a file.
[00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:02.963]  He opens his file on February 23rd, I think it is, 2005.
[00:07:02.963 --> 00:07:10.548]  And he then undertakes a campaign to get anybody to listen to him to try to prosecute this.
[00:07:10.548 --> 00:07:15.190]  He goes to the Ward County DA, a guy named Randall Reynolds.
[00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:17.693]  He doesn't want to do it.
[00:07:17.693 --> 00:07:20.415]  He says there's nothing involved here.
[00:07:20.415 --> 00:07:29.783]  Over a two-year period of time, Brzezinski, this Texas Ranger, takes the case to Greg Abbott, the Attorney General of the state of Texas.
[00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.865]  Greg Abbott doesn't do anything.
[00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:34.107]  He takes it to Johnny Sutton, the U.S.
[00:07:34.107 --> 00:07:36.929]  Attorney in El Paso.
[00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:39.211]  Johnny Sutton doesn't do anything.
[00:07:39.211 --> 00:07:45.136]  Johnny Sutton's office writes a stupid letter that says that there's no civil rights violation unless the
[00:07:45.635 --> 00:07:48.657]  The boy feels pain, basically.
[00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:51.119]  Oh, so does it even deny the raping's going on?
[00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:52.641]  No, it does not deny that it's going on.
[00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:54.702]  Hell, they might as well just institutionalize it.
[00:07:54.702 --> 00:07:56.724]  He just says, I don't have enough here.
[00:07:56.724 --> 00:07:58.605]  It says not enough evidence to do anything.
[00:07:58.605 --> 00:08:01.228]  I can't prove that these boys felt pain.
[00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:04.891]  So I will just have maybe a one-year sentence that I can go after.
[00:08:04.891 --> 00:08:06.532]  I decline.
[00:08:06.532 --> 00:08:08.674]  And then it goes to Attorney General Gonzalez.
[00:08:08.674 --> 00:08:10.315]  It goes to the Civil Rights Division.
[00:08:11.118 --> 00:08:11.699]  of the U.S.
[00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:14.301]  Justice Department, and they declined prosecution.
[00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:17.803]  And notice, this is a guy that writes memos saying children can be tortured.
[00:08:17.803 --> 00:08:19.465]  That's right.
[00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:37.039]  Well, this is... Now, here you've got this Texas Ranger Brzezinski running this campaign, and finally, I'm convinced he finally just leaked the report to the Dallas newspapers, and a few of the newspapers in Texas covered this in February, and it started blowing up.
[00:08:37.902 --> 00:08:38.783]  I got a hold of it.
[00:08:38.783 --> 00:08:41.806]  I got a hold of it last Thursday and Friday.
[00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:45.829]  And, of course, we have it up now as the lead article on WorldNetDaily.
[00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:47.671]  So it's up nationwide.
[00:08:47.671 --> 00:08:51.414]  And this lid has been blown on this case totally as a result.
[00:08:51.414 --> 00:09:01.984]  I watched the videotape of a Texas Senate hearing in which Brzezinski detailed how for two years no prosecutor in Texas would listen to him.
[00:09:01.984 --> 00:09:03.145]  They didn't want to touch the case.
[00:09:03.783 --> 00:09:03.883]  U.S.
[00:09:03.883 --> 00:09:04.784]  Attorney did not want to touch it.
[00:09:04.784 --> 00:09:08.046]  And that shows that they know it's systemic throughout the system.
[00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:15.491]  Yes, and also, even if you look at Sutton's letter, or the criminal justice letter, they all acknowledge it's going on.
[00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:16.651]  They all say it's going on.
[00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:18.593]  They say, we don't want to prosecute.
[00:09:18.593 --> 00:09:20.314]  But they do not say that they know everything that's going on.
[00:09:20.314 --> 00:09:20.754]  Well, you know what?
[00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:21.755]  I don't even want to cover it.
[00:09:21.755 --> 00:09:22.555]  It's disgusting.
[00:09:22.555 --> 00:09:23.696]  It makes your stomach turn.
[00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:25.817]  But you've got to, or this is going to continue.
[00:09:25.817 --> 00:09:27.038]  You've got to cover it.
[00:09:27.038 --> 00:09:27.879]  You've got to cover it.
[00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:28.859]  We've got to cover it.
[00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:33.122]  And then, what this says is, you put this to Johnny Sutton's office, an attorney,
[00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:42.287]  General Gonzalez, and it puts a new light and dimension on the fact that political prosecutions are what are coming out of the Justice Department right now.
[00:09:42.287 --> 00:09:50.639]  Because Johnny Sutton is the same guy who, when the Mexican consulate writes a letter, goes and prosecutes Ramos and Campion,
[00:09:51.109 --> 00:09:55.952]  Two border patrol agents are violating the civil rights of a fleeing drug smuggler.
[00:09:55.952 --> 00:10:04.598]  Well, don't forget, Gonzales is a former Enron lawyer and on one of the big state courts, so he's a big boy here in Texas.
[00:10:04.598 --> 00:10:06.099]  He knows all about it.
[00:10:06.099 --> 00:10:13.364]  Well, and also then they go prosecute, you know, Joe Hernandez at Rock Springs, Texas, the deputy sheriff.
[00:10:13.364 --> 00:10:18.247]  He fired after a van of fleeing illegal aliens that were trying to run him over.
[00:10:19.438 --> 00:10:37.968]  And now Gonzalez is in federal prison, and of course, the illegal alien who was in that van, one of the women who got shot in the cheek from a ricocheting bullet or a fragment, she now has an attorney and she's going to sue Gil Hernandez, Sheriff Letzinger, and the town of Rock Springs.
[00:10:37.968 --> 00:10:44.452]  You know, when a citizen runs and the police shoot at them, it's no big deal, but then when it's a precious illegal alien, it's like a three-alarm fire.
[00:10:44.452 --> 00:10:48.134]  Or, put in this context, Johnny Sutton, at the behest of the Mexican government,
[00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:55.374]  He can and does take on himself to file a civil rights violation case against law enforcement authorities.
[00:10:55.374 --> 00:11:02.039]  Well, we've got 10-year-old boys getting raped by demons, and they just say, well, maybe they like it, you know.
[00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:10.666]  In fact, Johnny Sutton's letter basically said, maybe the kids here have consented, and we can't prove that they were really hurt.
[00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:13.868]  Oh, yeah, when you're a prisoner, maybe they're consenting.
[00:11:13.868 --> 00:11:15.569]  Maybe it'll just be the new thing.
[00:11:15.569 --> 00:11:17.371]  When you go to prison... Listen, folks.
[00:11:18.516 --> 00:11:21.016]  I've been in juvenile, okay?
[00:11:21.016 --> 00:11:30.318]  One time I was sent to Terrell when I got in a fist fight and the guy went to the hospital and I had to go to court because when somebody goes to the hospital in a coma, you go to jail.
[00:11:30.318 --> 00:11:37.719]  And I was in juvenile one time and had the jail guards tell me he wanted to have sex with me.
[00:11:37.719 --> 00:11:40.560]  And I told him, I said, my dad will kill you.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.900]  You are dead.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.981]  And he just closed the door and went on down the hall to rape somebody else.
[00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:46.041]  And he knew it too.
[00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:47.101]  I told him, you will die.
[00:11:47.968 --> 00:11:50.078]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:50.078 --> 00:11:50.540]  Stay with us.
[00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:56.167]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:11:56.167 --> 00:12:01.350]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.992]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:15.117]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:18.719]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:24.343]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:31.049]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:12:31.556 --> 00:12:32.857]  What about you?

[00:12:43.982 --> 00:12:44.923]  The real money folks.
[00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:03.589]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:13:03.589 --> 00:13:04.650]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.091]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:07.112]  A 5% increase.
[00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:09.914]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro.
[00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:13.256]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:13:13.256 --> 00:13:14.758]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:15.758]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:32.261]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:38.707]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:38.707 --> 00:13:43.331]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.

[00:13:46.694 --> 00:13:48.115]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:55.649]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:13:55.649 --> 00:14:05.242]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[00:14:05.242 --> 00:14:10.048]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:16.231]  A call for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:24.773]  This is the same New World Order call for by President, former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War 1990-1991.
[00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:35.821]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:14:35.821 --> 00:14:37.303]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:14:37.303 --> 00:14:37.683]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:14:37.683 --> 00:14:38.003]  Call now.
[00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:40.805]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:14:52.715 --> 00:14:59.281]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:01.763]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the economy.
[00:15:04.977 --> 00:15:05.698]  We're good to go.
[00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:29.541]  I think so.
[00:16:12.384 --> 00:16:13.764]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:18.966]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is our guest.
[00:16:18.966 --> 00:16:19.486]  Look at this!
[00:16:22.498 --> 00:16:23.739]  This is a letter here.
[00:16:23.739 --> 00:16:30.322]  I would speculate that the political powers in Texas and Washington and the Republican Party were not interested in the sex scandal coming to light.
[00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:40.186]  Sutton and Gonzales let their political responsibilities outstrip their legal responsibilities and as a result you had children who were in danger of sexual abuse and were left in that danger.
[00:16:40.186 --> 00:16:41.987]  Well, it's like DynCorp and Halliburton.
[00:16:41.987 --> 00:16:44.248]  It was in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:16:44.248 --> 00:16:51.412]  Two different reports running giant child and female kidnapping rings and slave camps.
[00:16:52.054 --> 00:16:59.831]  Where they also use them just, it was from sex slavery right down to sweatshops, I mean actual slaves folks, out of Europe and the Middle East.
[00:17:00.689 --> 00:17:02.750]  And nothing's going to be done.
[00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:09.915]  This really is the ruling elite's modus operandi, the tie that binds.
[00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:13.677]  Dr. Corsi burrowing into this nest of these people.
[00:17:13.677 --> 00:17:15.879]  Do you think it's just going to keep unraveling and coming out?
[00:17:15.879 --> 00:17:19.641]  Because frankly, I don't see Rick Perry from his past activities.
[00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:21.022]  I see him whitewashing this.
[00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:24.344]  I mean, they're already going after these jail guards and people
[00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:30.130]  For things like criminally extending sentences and hiring felons.
[00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.253]  They're not going after him for the really hardcore stuff.
[00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:39.799]  Well, I think with us bringing national attention to it, Alex, it's going to be a lot harder to bury this in Texas.
[00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:44.424]  And with the whole scandal over the firing of eight U.S.
[00:17:44.424 --> 00:17:48.068]  attorneys by Gonzalez and the congressional investigation that's ongoing.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.562]  And also the investigation that's ongoing into Johnny Sutton's role, the U.S.
[00:17:52.562 --> 00:18:01.448]  prosecutor in El Paso, in prosecuting the Border Patrol agents, Ramos and Campion, for shooting after a fleeing Mexican drug smuggler.
[00:18:01.448 --> 00:18:05.751]  There's plenty of investigations into which this story fits as context.
[00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.272]  And I think it'll have to be pursued.
[00:18:07.272 --> 00:18:17.178]  I mean, if you've got guards and, you know, every level of staff involved in a pedophile scheme within the Texas
[00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:25.298]  Youth Commission facilities throughout the state, and it's going to involve dozens of criminal complaints and cases.
[00:18:25.298 --> 00:18:33.164]  They should all be released right now, whatever crimes they're... I mean, if they're non-violent, these kids should be out of there now, because we know the crime's ongoing.
[00:18:33.164 --> 00:18:42.712]  Well, and the cases that ought to come out of this, you know, you've got two years of time in which Brzezinski, this Texas Ranger, was pressing.
[00:18:42.712 --> 00:18:45.875]  He had the investigation, pressing somebody to get prosecuted.
[00:18:46.345 --> 00:18:52.309]  Now that's two years of abuse in these facilities throughout the state of Texas.
[00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:54.610]  The children suffered that they didn't have to suffer.
[00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:57.906]  And I would think that that would lead to some excellent lawsuits.
[00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:10.933]  That makes, criminally not just civilly, I mean that clearly meets the standard of being complicit after the fact and really fostering all this happening.
[00:19:10.933 --> 00:19:15.775]  Alberto Gonzalez and Johnny Sutton, they need to be indicted for covering this up.
[00:19:15.775 --> 00:19:19.197]  Well that's right because you see it's not just the instance now where we can prove
[00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:32.350]  That there was instances of child abuse going on at these facilities, but there was a conspiracy to commit sodomy and other sexual acts with minor children in these facilities.
[00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:46.873]  Now, that information came to Johnny Sutton and to Alberto Gonzalez, and we know it did, because we have the letters in which both the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and Johnny Sutton's office, Bill Ballman, the same
[00:19:47.777 --> 00:19:48.897]  Assistant U.S.
[00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:57.419]  Attorney who prosecuted the Gil Hernandez case, they wrote a declined prosecution, which made it clear they knew that there was an investigation that was conducted.
[00:19:57.419 --> 00:20:15.542]  Now, if that investigation turns out to have been that they should have known, it was a conspiracy to commit these acts, and yet they didn't prosecute or investigate, I think the burden of proof on Sutton and Gonzales is going to increase dramatically as to why they were negligent in their
[00:20:16.427 --> 00:20:29.351]  Well, they're also criminally negligent with all these Mexican troop incursions and shooting and killing border patrol and sheriff's deputies.
[00:20:29.351 --> 00:20:32.552]  I mean, these guys are just absolute crooks.
[00:20:32.552 --> 00:20:44.055]  Right, well, and the way I think that they're going to take a fall on this, Alex, is, you know, the kind of ways I've been taught and I've always done investigations, I remember back in the McClellan Committee days,
[00:20:44.747 --> 00:21:00.605]  When the proof that the Teamsters were being penetrated by gangsters got down to their hotel bills, and you know, looking to see their laundry was being paid for through the rooms they were holding in the hotels, not by the union, but by the mobsters.
[00:21:01.388 --> 00:21:05.610]  You could say to this guy, if you're a union official, why does this mobster over here pay your hotel bill?
[00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.650]  Well, here's another example.
[00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:10.512]  I talked to somebody who I know very well, a very truthful person.
[00:21:10.512 --> 00:21:22.758]  They mentioned to me, back in the late 80s, being at a huge Mexican Mafia meeting, where La Raza met you, and Gonzalez was one of the key people there, in his suit the whole nine yards.
[00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:26.402]  I mean, you know, this guy is just something else.
[00:21:26.402 --> 00:21:30.524]  Well, here's the hard evidence you've got here that's like the hotel bill.
[00:21:30.524 --> 00:21:31.445]  Well, stay there.
[00:21:31.445 --> 00:21:31.965]  We're going to break.
[00:21:31.965 --> 00:21:38.168]  Let's do five more minutes on the other side, sir, and I'll let you get back to your important work, and I'm going to cover international news and take more calls.
[00:21:38.168 --> 00:21:39.629]  Doctors in the Room, of course, he's our guest.
[00:21:39.629 --> 00:21:43.111]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:43.111 --> 00:21:44.511]  We're on the march.
[00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:47.033]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:47.033 --> 00:21:49.714]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:53.809 --> 00:21:56.411]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:58.593]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:21:58.593 --> 00:22:05.898]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.

[00:22:55.532 --> 00:22:58.074]  Does this sound bring on a sudden onset of fear?
[00:22:58.074 --> 00:23:00.296]  A fear of not knowing who's on the other end?
[00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:04.920]  Do you avoid picking up the phone knowing it's just going to be another harassing phone call from a debt collector?
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.685]  Do you resent your daily trips to the mailbox knowing it will be flooded with notices from creditors?
[00:23:09.685 --> 00:23:12.867]  Over 1 million credit card holders will declare bankruptcy this year.

[00:23:24.275 --> 00:23:27.217]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:23:27.217 --> 00:23:29.838]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:23:29.838 --> 00:23:33.661]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:23:33.661 --> 00:23:40.905]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:23:54.392 --> 00:23:58.534]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[00:23:58.534 --> 00:24:06.297]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[00:24:06.297 --> 00:24:17.322]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network, Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:18.122]  Central.
[00:24:18.122 --> 00:24:23.725]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[00:24:24.065 --> 00:24:30.447]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[00:24:30.447 --> 00:24:35.568]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[00:24:35.568 --> 00:24:40.809]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[00:24:40.809 --> 00:24:42.169]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:43.190]  Central.
[00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:50.592]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[00:25:02.054 --> 00:25:04.876]  It's scary to admit that criminals are running the government.
[00:25:04.876 --> 00:25:06.136]  Both parties.
[00:25:06.136 --> 00:25:07.977]  Most states are completely criminal run.
[00:25:07.977 --> 00:25:13.661]  They're involved in weapons dealing, drug dealing, child porn.
[00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:14.561]  Because they're evil.
[00:25:14.561 --> 00:25:15.602]  They don't have a conscience.
[00:25:15.602 --> 00:25:17.543]  They enjoy all the things they do.
[00:25:17.543 --> 00:25:18.843]  And they hire their own people.
[00:25:18.843 --> 00:25:20.364]  And that's what tyranny is.
[00:25:20.364 --> 00:25:23.646]  Once you get corrupt people in government, it just accelerates.
[00:25:23.646 --> 00:25:25.267]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is our guest.
[00:25:25.267 --> 00:25:26.288]  I know we have loaded phone lines.
[00:25:26.288 --> 00:25:26.968]  I'm going to get to you.
[00:25:27.871 --> 00:25:30.532]  Doctor, boiling it down, you were talking about smoking gun evidence.
[00:25:30.532 --> 00:25:34.512]  Yeah, your seven-page report of the World End Daily is absolutely amazing.
[00:25:34.512 --> 00:25:40.134]  We'll link to it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for folks who want to go link through there.
[00:25:40.134 --> 00:25:51.916]  Please, just any other key areas in your investigation that need to be hit on and give us any other kind of a heads up on what new revelations may be coming out next.
[00:25:51.916 --> 00:25:56.637]  I think, Alex, the next things are going to be to track this report that the Texas Ranger did.
[00:25:57.613 --> 00:26:14.200]  He developed this report in February 2005 to track the timeline through which he was rejected prosecution by the district attorney in the county where it occurred, by the state, Greg Abbott, by the federal U.S.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:26.786]  attorney, Johnny Sutton, and by Alberto Gonzalez in the Criminal Civil Rights Investigation Division within the Department of Justice.
[00:26:27.352 --> 00:26:32.713]  For two years, he tried to get these specific allegations investigated and prosecuted.
[00:26:32.713 --> 00:26:34.314]  No one would touch it.
[00:26:34.314 --> 00:26:36.254]  Now it's blown up as a huge scandal.
[00:26:36.254 --> 00:26:41.496]  We see it's a sex scandal throughout the Texas Youth Commission.
[00:26:41.496 --> 00:26:42.656]  And let's be clear.
[00:26:42.656 --> 00:26:43.656]  Let's be clear.
[00:26:43.656 --> 00:26:51.998]  The federal prosecutor, the state prosecutors, the locals admit in letters that this is going on, but they say maybe they like it.
[00:26:51.998 --> 00:26:54.439]  They said outrageous things in the letters.
[00:26:54.439 --> 00:26:54.659]  U.S.
[00:26:54.659 --> 00:26:55.039]  attorneys
[00:26:56.182 --> 00:27:00.303]  Office letter, Johnny Sutton's letter, written by Bill Bauman, the assistant U.S.
[00:27:00.303 --> 00:27:08.925]  attorney who prosecuted Gil Hernandez, says outrageous things, like maybe there was no physical pain suffered by these children.
[00:27:08.925 --> 00:27:10.866]  Maybe it was consensual.
[00:27:10.866 --> 00:27:11.806]  Now let's be clear here.
[00:27:11.806 --> 00:27:12.886]  Maybe it was consensual.
[00:27:12.886 --> 00:27:21.368]  I mean, first of all, we're talking about criminal sodomy against minors, and the issue of consent is irrelevant.
[00:27:21.368 --> 00:27:22.328]  There's no consent.
[00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:24.689]  Well, exactly, but I mean, let's flesh that out.
[00:27:25.265 --> 00:27:25.545]  Yes, sir.
[00:27:37.757 --> 00:27:43.123]  For the most, you know, petty of stuff where somebody goes to the wrong site and it's 16-year-old girls.
[00:27:43.123 --> 00:27:54.677]  Now, you get into this case, this is people who are at a prison, in control, and they're doing this in an organized fashion, and they're hiring felons who have the same sick taste for this.
[00:27:54.677 --> 00:27:56.178]  This is a conspiracy.
[00:27:56.178 --> 00:27:57.360]  This is racketeering.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.741]  And then you've got the U.S.
[00:27:58.741 --> 00:28:02.624]  Attorney and others saying, well, you know, maybe they like it.
[00:28:02.624 --> 00:28:03.926]  Maybe it didn't hurt.
[00:28:03.926 --> 00:28:05.587]  Maybe it's consensual.
[00:28:05.587 --> 00:28:06.528]  It's illegal.
[00:28:06.528 --> 00:28:07.989]  It's statutory rape.
[00:28:07.989 --> 00:28:11.112]  And anytime someone is under your control, it's rape.
[00:28:11.112 --> 00:28:12.133]  This is incredible!
[00:28:12.133 --> 00:28:14.935]  Because this is the key here, Dr. Corsi, and obviously you know this.
[00:28:14.935 --> 00:28:15.516]  You've written about it.
[00:28:16.116 --> 00:28:18.777]  It shows the mind warp that these U.S.
[00:28:18.777 --> 00:28:28.160]  attorneys and prosecutors and state prosecutors have gotten so into this culture of denial and evil that they would write letters legitimizing it!
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.401]  I mean, do they have any idea how incriminating that is for themselves?
[00:28:31.401 --> 00:28:41.284]  That letter is incredibly incriminating, and so is the one from the Criminal Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, because, Alex, it's not only that there are instances
[00:28:42.117 --> 00:28:49.779]  of sodomy and other sexual abuse with minors going on these institutions, but it's a conspiracy to commit these acts.
[00:28:49.779 --> 00:29:05.642]  Because to be hired, the people who were hired into the Texas Youth Commission system, they knew they had felony records, they knew they had sexual misconduct records, they knew they were looking at pornography on state computers on work time, and that was all okay.
[00:29:05.642 --> 00:29:08.003]  In fact, it was probably a prerequisite to get a job.
[00:29:10.127 --> 00:29:14.391]  And again, this also keeps good men and women from having jobs.
[00:29:14.391 --> 00:29:21.056]  Right, but a conspiracy to commit a crime is far more serious an offense than just the commission of the crime.
[00:29:21.056 --> 00:29:26.280]  And it also, again, these criminal networks can't have good cops, good jail guards in their system.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:26.701]  That's right.
[00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:30.444]  Everybody has to be part of the deal, otherwise it can't go on.
[00:29:30.444 --> 00:29:33.486]  And this evidently went on in the Texas Youth Commission for years.
[00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:39.251]  It was at least, you know, Brzezinski has been trying to blow the whistle on it.
[00:29:39.251 --> 00:29:51.217]  Well, I know parents for a long time have tried to go public, too, but usually they just send a SWAT team by the house and claim they're drug dealers or, you know, go raid their house and claim they're doing stuff, and that's how these these rings work.
[00:29:51.217 --> 00:29:57.781]  Well, I'm publishing it, you know, chapter and verse on World Net Daily right now and interviewing the people involved, and we're going to get
[00:29:58.328 --> 00:30:00.669]  I think they're going to have to do something with the light of day shown on it.
[00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:02.729]  The entire board of this Texas Youth Commission has resigned.
[00:30:20.239 --> 00:30:23.440]  They don't have anybody left there running it who was running it before the scandal broke.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.521]  Yeah, but they all, I mean, listen, these people, these prosecutors, all of them, need to be arrested now.
[00:30:28.521 --> 00:30:35.583]  I mean, there's a lot of people who need to be arrested right now, and this thing, I think, is going to take a huge, crashing fall.
[00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:37.963]  And I think some of them need to be executed, too.
[00:30:37.963 --> 00:30:41.344]  Because I think a conspiracy against children is one of the worst crimes there are.
[00:30:41.344 --> 00:30:43.785]  We need to teach these people a lesson.
[00:30:43.785 --> 00:30:49.886]  Clearly, you know, the seriousness of these offenses, and people are saying, well, why isn't it just handled on a state level?
[00:30:50.305 --> 00:30:59.589]  When you get this kind of a criminal conspiracy operating within a statewide system, you know, you've got an offense here that's a federal level of violation.
[00:30:59.589 --> 00:31:01.870]  And it's being carried out by the bureaucracy.
[00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:08.653]  Being carried out by the bureaucracy of the state, and the state attorney general evidently also declined to take this up and prosecute it.
[00:31:08.653 --> 00:31:11.774]  Now, you've got to know as bad as Texas is, Florida's worse.
[00:31:11.774 --> 00:31:12.314]  Well, I'm sure.
[00:31:12.314 --> 00:31:13.995]  And there's going to be a lot of finger-pointing.
[00:31:13.995 --> 00:31:16.316]  They're going to be saying, no, no, it's all, you know,
[00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:26.784]  Randall Raymond over here in Ward County, because he wouldn't ask Abbott to come and do it, who is the Attorney General in Texas.
[00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:30.065]  We have to wait until he's asked before Abbott can get involved.
[00:31:30.065 --> 00:31:46.288]  Well, that's just not the case, because you've got the Texas Ranger showing that report to everybody at every level of government and saying, at your level, at the level of the Attorney General, you don't need the permission of the county to go into this, because it's a statewide offense.
[00:31:46.974 --> 00:31:48.936]  Committed across counties.
[00:31:48.936 --> 00:31:52.018]  So you don't need to wait until some county asks you to come in.
[00:31:52.018 --> 00:31:53.259]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:55.101]  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[00:31:55.101 --> 00:31:56.782]  I mean, just the excuses.
[00:31:56.782 --> 00:32:03.007]  Why do you think that these different high-level officials would write letters trying to legitimize this back to investigators?
[00:32:03.007 --> 00:32:05.409]  I mean, that is just off the charts.
[00:32:05.409 --> 00:32:09.272]  Yeah, I think they just lost all contacts with reality.
[00:32:09.272 --> 00:32:13.756]  They forget they're writing about sodomy and saying that they have to have physical pain
[00:32:14.258 --> 00:32:17.704]  Or the consent makes a difference when you're talking about children.
[00:32:17.704 --> 00:32:21.571]  These are innocent children, most of them in there for no reason.
[00:32:21.571 --> 00:32:27.462]  Right, or, you know, they're in there, supposedly, wards of the state, not in there to be made into a sex camp.
[00:32:29.042 --> 00:32:38.826]  Now, I don't want to go into too many of the details, but closing, because all I have is what's in the papers, what we've heard from law enforcement sources, about the, I mean, any other details about the full nature?
[00:32:38.826 --> 00:32:40.167]  Because you said sex parties.
[00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:47.770]  Some of the more egregious statements that are coming out is evidently the boys were, you know, they were roused from their sleep at night.
[00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:53.853]  They were made to participate in group sex parties with the guards and other supervisors at these institutions.
[00:32:54.488 --> 00:32:57.149]  I mean, I'm sure there was a whole range of offenses going on.
[00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:59.350]  Sounds like just a nightmare.
[00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:10.435]  It was a nightmare, and I'm sure any boy who was in that knew within the first hour they were in the facility what the whole game of the whole joint was, and either you played or you got badly abused in other ways.
[00:33:10.435 --> 00:33:11.856]  But it looks like if 93% of their
[00:33:15.274 --> 00:33:23.860]  It's an institutionalized form of pedophilia aimed at sexual abuse of boys who were underage by people who were hired by the state of Texas to be their supervisors and administrators.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.761]  Is the state of Texas putting
[00:33:41.098 --> 00:33:49.963]  In a position of authority, pedophiles to prey on a captive group of minor youth who have no alternative but to stay locked up at the facility if they're abused.
[00:33:49.963 --> 00:34:03.592]  You know, when some dirtbag pedophile grabs a 10-year-old off the street and rapes him, people call it the death penalty, and this is being whitewashed in our media, and then you read a letter from a state official saying, well, maybe it didn't hurt, maybe they wanted it.
[00:34:03.592 --> 00:34:08.475]  I mean, this is, I just, what is going on here?
[00:34:08.475 --> 00:34:10.656]  And if you have Attorney General Gonzalez,
[00:34:11.252 --> 00:34:11.752]  And U.S.
[00:34:11.752 --> 00:34:14.774]  Attorney Johnny Sutton saying, no, but you know, it's okay.
[00:34:14.774 --> 00:34:32.707]  When Mexico asks, we'll go prosecute a law enforcement officer who violated the civil rights of an illegal alien who was in here smuggling drugs or participating in a conspiracy to smuggle human beings in here and driving in a van or riding in a van that's trying to run over the police officer.
[00:34:32.707 --> 00:34:36.709]  I mean, their civil rights have to be protected by Johnny Sutton.
[00:34:36.709 --> 00:34:38.731]  What about the civil rights of these incriminated
[00:34:39.104 --> 00:34:47.230]  You know, these boys are incarcerated here and are being pounded on by the guards who are hired to be their supervisors.
[00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:51.173]  Well, it's just going to get... It's ugly and it's going to get uglier.
[00:34:51.173 --> 00:34:57.318]  Well, I'm just mad that they're arresting people for knowingly hiring thousands of felons.
[00:34:57.318 --> 00:34:58.098]  Thousands.
[00:34:58.098 --> 00:34:59.319]  You had to be a felon.
[00:34:59.319 --> 00:35:01.241]  I'm asking the questions, Alex.
[00:35:01.241 --> 00:35:02.782]  Why did it take two years?
[00:35:02.782 --> 00:35:05.864]  What were you guys doing when you had this information?
[00:35:05.864 --> 00:35:06.905]  Why did you sit on it?
[00:35:07.461 --> 00:35:08.462]  What were you thinking?
[00:35:08.462 --> 00:35:10.203]  Maybe they should ask Jeff Gannon.
[00:35:10.203 --> 00:35:11.243]  Do they participate?
[00:35:11.243 --> 00:35:12.244]  Maybe they should.
[00:35:12.244 --> 00:35:16.526]  Are you participating in allowing this culture to exist?
[00:35:16.526 --> 00:35:17.867]  Are you going to be culpable?
[00:35:17.867 --> 00:35:20.789]  Well, look, this isn't your first rodeo, Dr. Corsi.
[00:35:20.789 --> 00:35:23.530]  I mean, Dr. Corsi, you've done research, you've been around.
[00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.952]  This just keeps popping up with the Republicans.
[00:35:26.952 --> 00:35:27.813]  It does.
[00:35:27.813 --> 00:35:31.114]  And I think the American people are going to get sick and tired of it.
[00:35:31.114 --> 00:35:36.858]  And the problem is, you know, a lot of these issues are bipartisan issues.
[00:35:37.698 --> 00:35:39.717]  The reason the Democrats won't look into it...
[00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.050]  If the Democrats don't want to offend... Oh, I agree.
[00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.313]  I mean, Barney Frank got caught running an underage brothel.
[00:35:46.313 --> 00:35:50.277]  Barney Frank got caught running an underage brothel out of his Maryland townhouse.
[00:35:50.277 --> 00:35:55.601]  I mean, we know they're involved too, but I mean, it's just nine times out of ten, it's Republicans popping up with this.
[00:35:55.601 --> 00:35:57.102]  Maybe the Democrats just hide it better.
[00:35:57.102 --> 00:35:57.763]  I mean, what?
[00:35:57.763 --> 00:35:59.284]  This is scary.
[00:35:59.284 --> 00:36:00.865]  Dr. Corsi, I'm scared.
[00:36:00.865 --> 00:36:05.690]  I mean, if we've got people running the government like this, we're in deep, deep, deep, deep.
[00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:07.251]  And it's got to be exposed.
[00:36:07.251 --> 00:36:08.532]  The people have got to be aware of it.
[00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:13.550]  And Republican or Democrat, this behavior is absolutely unacceptable.
[00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.771]  It's not only criminal, it's shocking and horrifying.
[00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:22.233]  To think that we would allow this to go on in the United States of America is horrifying.
[00:36:22.233 --> 00:36:24.014]  Any inkling on what's coming out next?
[00:36:24.014 --> 00:36:27.976]  You just started talking to the governor's office and they're... I'm digging into it.
[00:36:27.976 --> 00:36:31.917]  These cases take a while to dig into.
[00:36:31.917 --> 00:36:33.658]  More facts will come to light.
[00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:36.299]  But tomorrow I'll have another major article on WorldNetDaily.
[00:36:36.934 --> 00:36:43.579]  And I'll report tomorrow that the sexual abuse scandal is now known to be widespread.
[00:36:43.579 --> 00:36:51.084]  All the offices of the Texas Youth Commission throughout the state involved, and employees from the top to the bottom, all involved.
[00:36:51.084 --> 00:36:58.709]  Thousands of cases are likely to be, should be, hundreds of investigations and arrests and prosecutions.
[00:36:58.709 --> 00:37:01.611]  And if there aren't, we'll want to know why there aren't.
[00:37:01.611 --> 00:37:06.435]  Well, because they'll tell the judge, you bring me in here, I'm going to burn you.
[00:37:07.202 --> 00:37:10.743]  Well, I'll tell them the boys didn't suffer any pain and they consented to it.
[00:37:10.743 --> 00:37:12.344]  That's what the letters from the U.S.
[00:37:12.344 --> 00:37:18.346]  Attorney and the Criminal Division of the Justice Department say, the Civil Rights Division.
[00:37:18.346 --> 00:37:22.247]  Look, I linked to the letters today in the article I wrote in WorldNetDaily.
[00:37:22.247 --> 00:37:23.447]  Read the actual letters.
[00:37:23.447 --> 00:37:27.228]  Now, you were telling my producer that some of the government sites are now down?
[00:37:27.228 --> 00:37:30.610]  I told, SPP.gov has been down all day.
[00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:34.851]  They say the path worked, the path name to it is not valid.
[00:37:35.396 --> 00:37:45.533]  I've been trying to get into the SPP, the Security and Prosperity Partnership, the North America primary website of the Department of Commerce all day long, and it no longer exists.
[00:37:45.533 --> 00:37:45.954]  Uh-oh.
[00:37:45.954 --> 00:37:48.298]  They may have decided to pull that.
[00:37:48.298 --> 00:37:48.759]  I don't know.
[00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:52.182]  First assumption is going to be it's a technical glitch.
[00:37:52.182 --> 00:37:53.923]  Let's see how long it stays down.
[00:37:53.923 --> 00:37:56.884]  Well, I hope that's not the case, because we need that for research purposes.
[00:37:56.884 --> 00:37:58.925]  Dr. Corsi, thanks for all the time.
[00:37:58.925 --> 00:37:59.765]  Alex, anytime.
[00:37:59.765 --> 00:38:00.926]  Always a pleasure to be with you.
[00:38:00.926 --> 00:38:01.546]  Thank you.
[00:38:01.546 --> 00:38:03.347]  And I know it's tough to cover these stories.
[00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:08.089]  It takes bravery, too, because this is a national, international network, but good job.
[00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:09.049]  It's got to be covered.
[00:38:09.049 --> 00:38:09.569]  Thank you, Alex.
