[00:00:05.663 --> 00:00:06.323]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.963 --> 00:00:08.024]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:09.864]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:11.324]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:13.025]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:17.486]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:21.907]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:54.274]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, you don't need me to tell you that stocks plunged nearly 400 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday and has plunged several hundred points again today in trading.
[00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.035]  It is now gyrating up and down.
[00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:01.296]  We will be going over that today with continual coverage of what's happening
[00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:09.203]  In the markets, remember, that's 400 points plus now in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:13.807]  That's only the top 30 stocks, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:28.520]  Simple things like going and looking at the Nikkei and in Japan, looking at the Chinese indexes and looking at the British index and the German and the DAX and the rest of it, it's all red.
[00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:36.033]  In fact, before I even look at the numbers, I can turn television on when they're flipping back and forth the different stock exchanges.
[00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:41.418]  I can go online and just look at the pictures and see all red boards.
[00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.320]  That is not a good sign.
[00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.422]  Red means the arrows are pointing down.
[00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:49.285]  Green means the arrows are going up.
[00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.691]  So, we will cover all of this.
[00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:56.454]  The Dow plunged 387 points on subprime concerns.
[00:01:56.514 --> 00:01:59.016]  Folks, it's not subprimes, it's the jumbo loan markets.
[00:01:59.477 --> 00:02:01.318]  That's over 400,000 dollar loan houses.
[00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.662]  It's also on just many mainline standard mortgages.
[00:02:05.702 --> 00:02:07.063]  People are walking away from them.
[00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:10.025]  That is going on right now.
[00:02:13.328 --> 00:02:18.532]  The European Central Bank put in a 95 billion pound.
[00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:19.893]  Okay, that is
[00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.392]  That is massive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:39.457]  We're talking about more than $200 billion European Plunge Protection Team going in and buying $200 billion of debt from these mortgage companies, and it didn't do anything.
[00:02:39.737 --> 00:02:41.118]  The numbers kept going down.
[00:02:41.698 --> 00:02:47.040]  Now, what did our Federal Reserve do that should have put in something like $500 billion U.S.?
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.081]  Should have done that if they really wanted to reverse this?
[00:02:51.897 --> 00:02:52.558]  Guess what they did?
[00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:55.081]  They put $12 billion in.
[00:02:55.601 --> 00:03:00.206]  That's like putting a band-aid on a hatchet wound on your wrist.
[00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:09.316]  That'd be like if your hand was dangling from a piece of cartilage, blood was spraying across the room out of the arteries in your wrist, and they walk up and stick a band-aid on it.
[00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.481]  I just want to make it clear that the government
[00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:17.615]  The criminals that run it, the private banks that own us, are doing this by design.
[00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:22.398]  Now, they may jack it back up on Monday, and it may hit $15,000 in two weeks.
[00:03:22.458 --> 00:03:36.346]  It may go to, who knows what they'll do, but the point is, this is giving you an illustration, and I don't think that's going to happen, but the point is, this is an illustration of how out of whack these markets are, and how much credit they've pumped out there by design.
[00:03:38.387 --> 00:03:41.409]  So we got the European markets putting 95 billion pounds,
[00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.860]  By the way, they're in there pumping today, and it isn't working.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.962]  I mean, they're trying to get the arteries clamped, and they're still spraying.
[00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:53.923]  Over here, it's Band-Aid time.
[00:03:54.503 --> 00:04:03.146]  So they're actually over there, at least on the surface, $95 billion, and it was a real move to try to block it, and it isn't doing a darn thing.
[00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:11.549]  Well, it was plunging straight downwards yesterday, and they did it, and so it stopped the plunge, and now it's plunging again today.
[00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:13.186]  U.S.
[00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:14.747]  stocks tumble on credit concerns.
[00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:16.368]  Banks, brokers retreat.
[00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.130]  Some of the main lenders have shut down.
[00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.353]  The largest bank in France basically has had an attempted run on it and has shut down funds.
[00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:25.614]  You know about that.
[00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:33.998]  And I'm just saying, thank goodness Friday's here because this may create some type of respite in all of this.
[00:04:34.038 --> 00:04:35.059]  We're going to open the phones up.
[00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:40.130]  Jerome Corsi with an update on North American unions popping in for about 10 minutes at the bottom of this hour.
[00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.771]  Then Kent Schneider from the Ron Paul campaign.
[00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:44.191]  Their head honcho over there.
[00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.752]  Paul Craig Roberts again on the economy.
[00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:48.832]  Top economist for Reagan.
[00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:50.553]  And then Luke Radalsky.
[00:04:50.673 --> 00:04:52.493]  Four guests today and your calls.
[00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:56.054]  But I specifically want to hear from you on the economy when we get back.
[00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:57.995]  Got a bunch of other important news as well.
[00:04:58.055 --> 00:04:58.595]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:04.452 --> 00:05:09.917]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:17.924]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:25.667]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:37.492]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:41.334]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.715]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:47.877]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:04.127 --> 00:06:06.909]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:11.352]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:12.613]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.913 --> 00:06:17.476]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:20.077]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.577 --> 00:06:35.280]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.362]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:06:58.546 --> 00:07:03.707]  Do you know that you can go solar for under $1200 bucks now?
[00:07:04.228 --> 00:07:05.368]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:07:05.568 --> 00:07:09.689]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:15.200]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:22.126]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[00:07:22.882 --> 00:07:25.564]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:07:25.744 --> 00:07:35.711]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:39.694]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:07:39.754 --> 00:07:46.238]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:07:46.418 --> 00:07:47.459]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:48.600]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:06.231]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:08.832]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:32.468]  In just a few minutes, I'm going to take a few fast calls from listeners specifically on what's happening in the market right now.
[00:08:32.569 --> 00:08:40.897]  Stocks, of course, went down this morning, then recovered a little bit from earlier losses when the Fed injected more funds.
[00:08:42.094 --> 00:08:49.958]  Stocks moved off session lows after the Federal Reserve added more money to the banking system to stem the growing credit crunch.
[00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:58.323]  The Fed said it injected another $16 billion into the system, adding to the $19 billion the Fed put in earlier Friday.
[00:08:58.363 --> 00:08:59.964]  So those numbers are growing as we speak.
[00:09:00.004 --> 00:09:04.046]  In fact, I just refreshed and they'd already gone up again.
[00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:06.848]  But still, that is a paltry sum.
[00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:16.976]  Fundamentals have taken a back seat to fear and the panic of the day, said Brett Gallagher, Chief Investment Officer of Julius Baer Investment Management.
[00:09:18.037 --> 00:09:19.297]  Let's get real here.
[00:09:19.638 --> 00:09:20.838]  That's from CNBC.
[00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:25.782]  There's also criticism of the Federal Reserve, the private owners of the American people.
[00:09:25.822 --> 00:09:29.244]  And they openly, in documents, we're collateral.
[00:09:29.424 --> 00:09:33.567]  They literally do own us if you allow them to take receivership of you.
[00:09:33.627 --> 00:09:34.527]  It's a false debt.
[00:09:34.547 --> 00:09:35.528]  They don't actually own you.
[00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:37.985]  Possession of nine-tenths of a law.
[00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:39.666]  That's why they militarized the police, folks.
[00:09:39.706 --> 00:09:41.708]  That is the ownership taking place.
[00:09:41.808 --> 00:09:43.210]  And again, they openly say that.
[00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:44.531]  That's not hyperbole.
[00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:49.196]  The Fed is facing growing pressure to cut interest rates.
[00:09:50.597 --> 00:09:54.601]  If they cut interest rates, the dollar will plunge further.
[00:09:56.858 --> 00:10:03.964]  Okay, so you've got the stock market minions, the general public who wouldn't listen a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, five years ago.
[00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:07.347]  I've told people to get out of the stock market in 1999 when it was at its all-time high.
[00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:12.431]  At that point, back when $11,000-something really was $11,000 before they devalued the dollar.
[00:10:13.592 --> 00:10:15.814]  And these delionaires and the rest of them would laugh at me.
[00:10:16.495 --> 00:10:19.377]  They weren't laughing after that devaluation and after the correction.
[00:10:19.397 --> 00:10:22.119]  I mean, this is just basic fundamentals.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.862]  They want interest rates cut so that it will spur more credit.
[00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:32.903]  They think, at a certain point, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:34.744]  It's like putting perfume on a pig.
[00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:41.267]  So that the real estate boom will continue and cheap credit boom will continue.
[00:10:42.048 --> 00:10:44.829]  The bubble will continue to expand and then drive their prices.
[00:10:44.869 --> 00:10:45.449]  Stock market.
[00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.731]  A, your stock market is devalued in worth because of the dollar.
[00:10:50.552 --> 00:10:53.273]  B, the housing market is overvalued.
[00:10:54.159 --> 00:10:58.503]  And see, they've printed so much money, at a certain point, the bubble is going to pop.
[00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:00.284]  And everybody knows that.
[00:11:00.364 --> 00:11:01.445]  The question is, when?
[00:11:01.485 --> 00:11:02.606]  And is that happening now?
[00:11:03.267 --> 00:11:19.820]  Now, Europe is trying to prop up their markets, which were in danger of completely crashing yesterday, because of weakness in the dollar, weakness in the housing market in the United States, weakness in private securities.
[00:11:21.184 --> 00:11:30.408]  And we see now a rush back into the other equally leaky ship, Beached Hulk, the shipwreck of U.S.
[00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:31.649]  government securities.
[00:11:32.349 --> 00:11:37.912]  So running from bad to worse, there's really not a safe haven in all of this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:38.872 --> 00:11:40.213]  And I'm sorry to have to say that.
[00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:48.157]  Now, they may be able to pump it up for a few more months, maybe even a few more years, but it only makes the crash that much worse down the line.
[00:11:48.598 --> 00:12:00.748]  Now, I'm somebody who, I remember being in trouble in middle school and being called in the principal's office to get a couple licks with that big paddle, and I sure didn't want to get it over with, even though it was better to get it over with.
[00:12:01.169 --> 00:12:03.070]  So, I mean, I kind of feel like that.
[00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:08.415]  I don't want to get it over with any more than you do, but still, the facts are there.
[00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:14.703]  The bigger this bubble gets, the worse the crash landing is going to be when it goes in to the ground.
[00:12:15.423 --> 00:12:18.264]  And I get these emails going, well, I'm not invested in the stocks.
[00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:19.264]  I'm sitting pretty.
[00:12:19.324 --> 00:12:20.084]  Ha ha ha.
[00:12:20.164 --> 00:12:21.204]  It's going to affect you.
[00:12:22.645 --> 00:12:27.766]  It's like people who don't care about the plan to shut down the web and censor it and tax what's left of it.
[00:12:28.486 --> 00:12:32.246]  And I get these phone calls and letters going, well, I'm not on the Internet, so I don't care.
[00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:35.087]  It's holding up even small town economies.
[00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:40.061]  It's one of the few good things we have in the U.S.
[00:12:40.101 --> 00:12:43.242]  economy left, and it will devastate that sector.
[00:12:43.622 --> 00:12:55.566]  But again, the monopoly men want that, and they do plan to, in one fell swoop, take more of our liberties during a crash, shut down much of the web during a crash, because I've seen them brag about it, is how we know.
[00:12:56.146 --> 00:13:02.268]  And they're going to move on a lot of fronts during this period, and probably couple that with a terror attack on top of it.
[00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:03.949]  Speaking of the devil,
[00:13:05.735 --> 00:13:11.758]  I saw this last night on Drudge, and I saw it everywhere else except on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:24.443]  Pitching for more dead Americans a neocon fetish, the Ward Churchill of the Demented Right Wing has a death wish for terror in order to unite the country.
[00:13:26.624 --> 00:13:32.707]  And this is a major, major news article written for the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:13:33.698 --> 00:13:37.900]  And he says, we need another massive terror attack, it'll be good for America, and he calls for it.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:55.226]  Now, remember two years ago, when Capitol Hill blew, which is pretty conservative, I mean, they're pretty neurotic, I would say, about proving and documenting things, and they've given good scoops in the past, so I believed it, came out with a Republican memo, Republican-wide at the highest levels.
[00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:57.647]  Several thousand Republicans got this.
[00:13:58.363 --> 00:14:02.387]  Later, about six months after it came out, that it was an accurate memo, by the way.
[00:14:02.907 --> 00:14:17.701]  We got told we were liars, too, even though Capitol Hill Blues even attacked us, but I was saying, no, this is accurate, Capitol Hill Blues are right, that it said we need more terror attacks, or to catch bin Laden, or to start another war, or we're cooked.
[00:14:18.803 --> 00:14:19.303]  Remember that.
[00:14:19.643 --> 00:14:20.244]  Two years ago.
[00:14:21.175 --> 00:14:28.020]  Since then, it's come out that the memo was accurate and that it was also recirculated at the state level in Michigan, Oklahoma, California.
[00:14:28.581 --> 00:14:31.663]  And we have a big list of these, but now it's in the newspaper.
[00:14:31.723 --> 00:14:32.984]  I mean, it's just out in the open.
[00:14:33.744 --> 00:14:35.926]  We have a big list of the individuals.
[00:14:36.186 --> 00:14:39.429]  Senator, former Senator Santorum, top neocon, saying it.
[00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:41.430]  Top military strategist in the U.S.
[00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.392]  and Canada saying it.
[00:14:43.732 --> 00:14:47.655]  Again, Republican Party heads of different political action committees
[00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:50.552]  Saying, we have a big list of them later.
[00:14:50.572 --> 00:14:53.393]  By the time I'm going to read this article, it's very, very important.
[00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.095]  And you need to go to PrisonPlanet.com and dig this story.
[00:14:57.115 --> 00:14:58.135]  You need to help it get out.
[00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:01.097]  I mean, this is one of those key articles that comes out each week here.
[00:15:02.557 --> 00:15:08.160]  This is as important as the one a few days ago about the timeline to tyranny that Paul Watson put out.
[00:15:10.501 --> 00:15:11.941]  But I guess it got a little bit of attention.
[00:15:11.981 --> 00:15:13.362]  But this stuff needs to be seen.
[00:15:13.402 --> 00:15:15.323]  I mean, I'm desperately trying to get this out.
[00:15:16.343 --> 00:15:17.624]  But you can go into this article
[00:15:19.091 --> 00:15:25.873]  And you can read over it for yourself how the neocons are feverishly saying they need a terror attack.
[00:15:25.893 --> 00:15:26.753]  I mean, they say it.
[00:15:27.253 --> 00:15:29.854]  They say it's good, 9-11 was a good sacrifice.
[00:15:29.934 --> 00:15:34.515]  I mean, they're almost at the point of going, OK, we did it and it's good.
[00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:46.538]  I told the story about a... It's actually happened twice, but one big lobbyist who I've seen around a few times and who I know came up to me when I was about to go fishing with friends at the lake.
[00:15:47.794 --> 00:16:11.853]  And there's a little restaurant there by the lake, this is about three years ago, and I'm getting something out of the car, and he walks over, out by Lake Travis, and he says, Alright Alex, yeah, we know it's an inside job, but you know, the economy would collapse without that, and sometimes it's just what has to be done, nobody likes it, but you know, you ought to grow up, and just realize how things really work.
[00:16:13.527 --> 00:16:16.670]  I talked to this guy a few other times at the Capitol, and I was just like, man, that's really sick.
[00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:22.876]  And he goes, look, I don't like it, but you need to join it to be able to be inside and then try to stop these type things.
[00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:27.541]  It's sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:27.661 --> 00:16:28.342]  It's sick.
[00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:31.625]  And now they're basically in the newspaper going, yeah, it's good.
[00:16:35.715 --> 00:16:46.058]  So, you can go through and read where the GOP 2005 memo, which yearned for new attacks that would, quote, validate the President's war on terror and restore his image as a leader of the American people.
[00:16:46.458 --> 00:16:56.080]  Last month, former Republican Senator Rick Santorum suggested a series of unfortunate events, namely terror attacks, will occur within the next year, and will occur, and change America's citizens' perception of the war.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.520]  See, they don't care, folks.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.821]  They're going to brag right out in the open, and they're going to nuke a city.
[00:17:00.241 --> 00:17:03.202]  You're probably going to see hundreds of thousands dead, and they're going to be worshipped for it.
[00:17:04.767 --> 00:17:09.650]  They're gonna tell you what they're gonna do, and then you're gonna love them!
[00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:11.351]  It's sick!
[00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.292]  I'm so sick of these people!
[00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:18.915]  They didn't have to plunge the dollar!
[00:17:19.355 --> 00:17:19.875]  They've done it!
[00:17:20.596 --> 00:17:23.557]  They didn't have to do any of this, or overrun us with illegal aliens!
[00:17:24.118 --> 00:17:24.938]  Alright, I'm not gonna rant.
[00:17:25.058 --> 00:17:25.959]  I'm gonna settle down.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.221]  I get exhausted when I get mad now, and I just can't do it anymore.
[00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:32.600]  It's not an act, folks.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.463]  I really want you to start breaking things and smashing tables, okay?
[00:17:37.145 --> 00:17:39.067]  They're ruining our way of life by design.
[00:17:39.087 --> 00:17:40.208]  They're killing our country.
[00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:44.673]  And dumb cops are out arresting people who have Ron Paul signs and upside-down flags in their yards.
[00:17:44.693 --> 00:17:48.236]  Because they're too stupid to know what real patriotism is, you dumb twits!
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.701]  It goes on here.
[00:17:54.804 --> 00:18:04.126]  And the month before that, the new chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party, Dennis Milligan, said that there needed to be more attacks on American soil with the President to regain popular approval.
[00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:08.927]  An army of neocons, and it just goes on to all the military people saying, and the rest of it.
[00:18:12.007 --> 00:18:13.227]  So, there you go, folks.
[00:18:13.287 --> 00:18:14.448]  Let's talk about the economy.
[00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.268]  I'm just going to pop in with the callers, folks.
[00:18:16.308 --> 00:18:17.748]  Have your point about the economy ready.
[00:18:17.768 --> 00:18:20.949]  I'm going to take one call now, about four during the next segment.
[00:18:20.969 --> 00:18:21.709]  We've got a guest coming on.
[00:18:23.032 --> 00:18:24.233]  Oh, then I'll lose my call list.
[00:18:24.313 --> 00:18:25.114]  Who's up first here?
[00:18:26.595 --> 00:18:27.576]  Jim and Matt, you're on the air.
[00:18:27.596 --> 00:18:27.936]  Go ahead.
[00:18:27.956 --> 00:18:29.117]  Hi, Alex.
[00:18:29.157 --> 00:18:29.977]  First time caller.
[00:18:30.017 --> 00:18:31.238]  I want to just thank you for your show.
[00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:32.079]  You're a great patriot.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.762]  And I wanted to know what your spin is on this.
[00:18:35.802 --> 00:18:37.883]  I have two theories on what's happening in this market.
[00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:45.890]  The first is, do you think maybe they're using this as a springboard to do this summer finale that they're talking about, saying we were too
[00:18:46.846 --> 00:18:50.669]  Concerned with what was happening in the stock market, so we let our guard down.
[00:18:50.689 --> 00:18:55.153]  You notice the stock market was gyrating and going down right before 9-11.
[00:18:55.213 --> 00:18:56.935]  Yes, it all fits together.
[00:18:57.395 --> 00:18:59.237]  It's October, attack on Iran.
[00:18:59.477 --> 00:19:00.858]  They're saying we need 9-11.
[00:19:00.898 --> 00:19:02.719]  Cheney did call, that's the next article.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.602]  Mainstream news, he wants an attack on Iran now.
[00:19:06.122 --> 00:19:09.465]  Folks, we are, it's never been more perilous.
[00:19:10.126 --> 00:19:10.346]  Right.
[00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:25.130]  Or do you think maybe, since you're getting the information out to the masses now, that they're saying it's too risky to pull an attack right now, so what we'll do is we'll pull the attack in the economy first, plunge the dollar, and then we'll go on from there.
[00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.311]  Well, let me be clear.
[00:19:26.831 --> 00:19:30.212]  I am a guy with a Daisy Beebe gun up against an elephant.
[00:19:30.512 --> 00:19:32.413]  So, by myself, I'm nobody.
[00:19:32.473 --> 00:19:33.433]  Let's get that straight.
[00:19:33.854 --> 00:19:37.515]  You, though, are a
[00:19:38.982 --> 00:19:40.763]  Rhodesian with an elephant gun.
[00:19:40.783 --> 00:19:44.345]  60 caliber out there.
[00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:47.767]  So, it's really up to you.
[00:19:47.807 --> 00:19:48.708]  I appreciate your call.
[00:19:49.508 --> 00:19:51.129]  Well, let me try to comment on what you said when we get back.
[00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:04.692]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:14.214]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.674 --> 00:20:21.876]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.606 --> 00:20:28.108]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.588 --> 00:20:39.411]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.151 --> 00:20:42.172]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.732 --> 00:20:45.513]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:45.554 --> 00:20:45.714]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:45.754 --> 00:20:48.755]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:13.194]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.395 --> 00:21:16.136]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:16.177 --> 00:21:17.297]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.638 --> 00:21:23.241]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.162 --> 00:21:31.427]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.428 --> 00:21:35.490]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Buck and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.083]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:42.064 --> 00:21:43.345]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:43.585 --> 00:21:45.787]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:52.713]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:53.394 --> 00:21:53.814]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:54.055]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:03.268 --> 00:22:07.751]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:08.112 --> 00:22:12.215]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:12.495 --> 00:22:13.055]  We listened.
[00:22:13.355 --> 00:22:18.339]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:18.619 --> 00:22:19.100]  We listened.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.522]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:22.942 --> 00:22:23.463]  We listened.
[00:22:23.923 --> 00:22:27.987]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:22:28.387 --> 00:22:28.868]  We listened.
[00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:34.453]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:22:34.873 --> 00:22:36.214]  Again, we listened.
[00:22:36.594 --> 00:22:38.176]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:43.921]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:22:44.361 --> 00:22:47.002]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[00:22:47.202 --> 00:22:47.402]  Only $279.
[00:22:47.462 --> 00:22:50.364]  Call New Millennium.
[00:22:50.384 --> 00:22:51.924]  888-803-4438.
[00:22:51.984 --> 00:22:54.865]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:22:58.167 --> 00:22:59.407]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:00.888 --> 00:23:02.669]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:23:02.749 --> 00:23:04.009]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:07.051]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:07.431 --> 00:23:10.152]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:10.738 --> 00:23:17.462]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:26.167]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.

[00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:45.317]  That's 877-873-9626.
[00:24:13.001 --> 00:24:16.784]  You know, I had Jerome Corsi come on and talk about the North American Union, but I just cancelled him.
[00:24:16.804 --> 00:24:27.971]  I don't want to be able to take your calls coming up in this hour before Kent Schneider from the Ron Paul campaign joins us.
[00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:30.232]  Then, of course, Luke Rodowski later.
[00:24:30.252 --> 00:24:31.993]  We're going to get Jerome back on next week.
[00:24:32.013 --> 00:24:34.555]  There's too much that's happening with the global markets right now.
[00:24:34.635 --> 00:24:36.016]  A big stack of news on that.
[00:24:36.096 --> 00:24:37.938]  European Central Bank to inject more cash.
[00:24:38.598 --> 00:24:39.239]  Asia acts.
[00:24:39.319 --> 00:24:41.860]  European Bank to add another $83 billion in liquidity.
[00:24:42.701 --> 00:24:46.444]  Bank of Japan, Reserve Bank of Australia also to act to calm credit markets.
[00:24:47.424 --> 00:24:49.786]  SEC scrutinizes Wall Street's big banks.
[00:24:51.187 --> 00:24:52.828]  Stormy weather on Wall Street.
[00:24:54.209 --> 00:24:56.331]  Bush markets can remain resilient.
[00:24:56.471 --> 00:24:57.692]  Oh, we feel so confident now.
[00:24:58.675 --> 00:25:08.023]  Fed acts to stem credit turmoil, worries about spending credit crunch, spreading credit crunch, plummet market.
[00:25:08.043 --> 00:25:10.305]  This is just some of what we're going to be going over.
[00:25:12.246 --> 00:25:15.849]  The big news here, I'll cover when we get back from break, Cheney urging strikes on Iran.
[00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.392]  That's McClatchy Newspapers.
[00:25:19.452 --> 00:25:21.294]  Frank in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:25:21.314 --> 00:25:24.316]  Alex, good afternoon Alex.
[00:25:24.476 --> 00:25:27.559]  I just wanted to say that I've been following, you know, the economy
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:40.375]  Very closely and it's estimated as of Tuesday that last week some 6 trillion US dollars or about 3 trillion euros were lost worldwide in the various markets.
[00:25:41.463 --> 00:25:49.266]  And also, we've heard this week, too, that the Bank of England is going to raise its borrowing rate to member banks to 6%.
[00:25:49.607 --> 00:25:53.428]  And that will cause a slide in the dollar further.
[00:25:53.448 --> 00:25:54.088]  That's correct.
[00:25:54.249 --> 00:26:02.292]  And the strategy that the United States has been following since Greenspan has been sort of borrowing money from the Bank of Japan at no interest.
[00:26:02.512 --> 00:26:04.573]  And right now, Japan is going to raise their
[00:26:05.416 --> 00:26:22.519]  uh... rate to about two percent which will mean that opportunity to uh... make and meet in the short time for the federal reserve won't be there so we're going to see a nasty mess but once again you know this is nothing that's really unexpected anyone that studied money in banking or economics
[00:26:23.495 --> 00:26:32.523]  You know, he's been aware of this for years, but ultimately we're going to see the errors of Greenspan's low-interest, you know, free borrowing.
[00:26:32.703 --> 00:26:34.045]  It's going to be disastrous for Greenspan.
[00:26:34.185 --> 00:26:35.326]  It isn't an error.
[00:26:35.346 --> 00:26:38.168]  This is the same thing they did in the run-up to the 2009 crash.
[00:26:38.629 --> 00:26:39.649]  Well, I'm being polite, Alex.
[00:26:40.948 --> 00:26:43.630]  I'm using a bit of irony there.
[00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:44.391]  Sure, sure.
[00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:48.994]  Should they do this globally to get everybody overextended and then consolidate wealth?
[00:26:49.454 --> 00:27:02.664]  And also, some of the news coming out of Turkey after the Bilderberg conference mentioned that the members participating had no problems with seeing a North American decline.
[00:27:03.704 --> 00:27:04.925]  You know, with the value of the dollar.
[00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:05.745]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:27:05.825 --> 00:27:12.847]  They intend to have a slow, gradual destruction of the country, so the yuppies will scream with pleasure as it happens.
[00:27:13.207 --> 00:27:19.928]  The problem is that once you start sneaking towards the door, everybody starts rushing, and it looks like that's happening right now.
[00:27:19.948 --> 00:27:25.330]  Yeah, and the sad thing is that the way the emero may be forced upon the U.S.
[00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:29.291]  is the fact that we know that the euro is about 30% backed by bullion.
[00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:39.993]  So, with the Amero, by having a very small percent backed by gold, it will be more desirable, they believe, for the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada in Mexico to go that route.
[00:27:40.313 --> 00:27:52.736]  But I don't know if really that's practical at this point, because we have so many problems right now, and I don't know what to say, Alex, but it's nothing that... What do you think is going to happen?
[00:27:52.756 --> 00:27:54.176]  Let's hear your prediction.
[00:27:54.476 --> 00:27:56.396]  I think what's going to happen is it's going to collapse.
[00:27:56.416 --> 00:27:57.457]  We're going to have two things.
[00:27:57.497 --> 00:27:59.137]  We're going to have the creation of
[00:28:00.041 --> 00:28:13.386]  For balance of payments, a partially-backed gold currency that the banks and corporations will use, and the dollars that the American people have in the pension funds, mutual funds, the stocks and bonds, that will not be backed.
[00:28:13.486 --> 00:28:15.687]  And we'll have a mixture of hyperinflation and depletion.
[00:28:15.707 --> 00:28:16.687]  That's right, that's right.
[00:28:16.707 --> 00:28:17.388]  You'll have security.
[00:28:17.408 --> 00:28:19.268]  How about Germany and the Weimar Republic?
[00:28:19.368 --> 00:28:19.969]  Gotta let you go.
[00:28:20.229 --> 00:28:28.492]  You're gonna have secured currencies for the elites, and unsecured for the public who won't even know what devalued securities are, because they know nothing.
[00:28:29.128 --> 00:28:30.708]  They think Sunnis are Shiites.
[00:28:31.129 --> 00:28:32.429]  They think Iraq's a good war.
[00:28:32.849 --> 00:28:35.450]  Well, you dish it out, you're going to get to eat it.
[00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.670]  You like being delusional weakling cowards.
[00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.931]  Well, you're going to get to live like them.
[00:28:40.971 --> 00:28:42.551]  All right along with the rest of us.
[00:28:43.031 --> 00:28:43.732]  Thanks a lot.
[00:28:44.272 --> 00:28:47.933]  They wouldn't do this to you if they didn't know you were made to be raped.
[00:28:48.253 --> 00:28:49.593]  You were made to be fleeced.
[00:28:49.633 --> 00:28:50.713]  You beg for it.
[00:28:51.393 --> 00:28:53.554]  And the saddest part about all this is going to be
[00:28:54.679 --> 00:28:57.781]  We're going to have to watch yuppies in the next year, maybe even sooner.
[00:28:57.881 --> 00:29:04.225]  They'll walk around and advise, and you'll hear them repeat whatever Chris Matthews said, whatever Bill O'Reilly said.
[00:29:04.785 --> 00:29:10.869]  Oh, the newest solution, they'll say, is to dollarize the currencies of Mexico and Canada.
[00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:16.373]  We'll still have our dollar, but it'll be pegged in some new bailout system.
[00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:23.634]  And then that gets us into the Amaro, and they've already said the SPP will be pushed through with terror and with economic collapse.
[00:29:23.954 --> 00:29:36.021]  See, they engineer the terror, they engineer the economic problems, even put memos out on it, and then pose as savers on the other side to then offer a new solution that gets you deeper down the rat hole.
[00:29:37.682 --> 00:29:38.943]  Are you seeing how big that is?
[00:29:41.966 --> 00:29:44.429]  And again, the yuppies, you're gonna have to listen to them, folks.
[00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:49.997]  Pair it at you and tell you and shake their finger at you as they sell more cyanide.
[00:29:51.879 --> 00:29:52.780]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:54.883]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.804 --> 00:29:58.488]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.338 --> 00:30:05.420]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:08.910]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.

[00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:52.281]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:55.962]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:18.833]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation Chapter 13?
[00:32:19.734 --> 00:32:24.435]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[00:32:24.955 --> 00:32:30.377]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?
[00:32:31.457 --> 00:32:39.560]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:33:22.012 --> 00:33:27.817]  The end of our elaborate plans.
[00:33:28.057 --> 00:33:33.942]  The end of everything that stands.
[00:33:34.042 --> 00:33:34.622]  The end
[00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:49.870]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:50.831]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:50.851 --> 00:33:55.192]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us today.
[00:33:55.212 --> 00:34:00.474]  We're going to go back to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:12.603 --> 00:34:16.466]  I want to get into what Dick Cheney is up to and a lot of other issues.
[00:34:18.827 --> 00:34:19.948]  Notice how it's all coming to a head.
[00:34:19.968 --> 00:34:22.309]  They're telling us the terrorists are about to attack us any minute.
[00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:24.611]  There's all these bin Laden tapes right on cue.
[00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:28.633]  Turns out they're fake or old or re-edited or photoshopped by those releasing them.
[00:34:28.673 --> 00:34:29.314]  Doesn't matter.
[00:34:30.377 --> 00:34:32.339]  You notice now that they're in a chorus.
[00:34:32.379 --> 00:34:33.880]  The government's saying we're about to be hit.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.721]  Feel it in their gut.
[00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:35.722]  Give up all your rights.
[00:34:36.122 --> 00:34:37.223]  Domestic spies.
[00:34:37.283 --> 00:34:38.684]  Got to federalize everything.
[00:34:39.104 --> 00:34:40.506]  Got to have an amnesty program.
[00:34:40.546 --> 00:34:41.927]  Got to have more troops for the war.
[00:34:42.307 --> 00:34:43.608]  Got to attack Iran.
[00:34:44.168 --> 00:34:48.512]  And right on cue, I said, if they're really going to run a terror attack, folks, look for the economy.
[00:34:48.552 --> 00:34:49.673]  Start tanking into the toilet.
[00:34:52.415 --> 00:34:57.224]  And for all the snickering Europeans and others, you're going to be financially hurt by all this, too.
[00:34:57.244 --> 00:34:59.469]  We're going to be hurt the worst here in the U.S.
[00:34:59.489 --> 00:35:02.675]  You see, the globalists hate Americans, and they write about this and talk about this.
[00:35:03.619 --> 00:35:17.247]  Even though Americans today are bred and trained to be servants and minions and cattle and to take anything and everything with a self-assured, arrogant smile on their face and their own little fruitcake delusion, they're literally mesmerized just walking around feeling important.
[00:35:17.528 --> 00:35:18.228]  It's mind control.
[00:35:18.548 --> 00:35:20.109]  Just, oh, I'm so powerful.
[00:35:20.529 --> 00:35:21.330]  Stumbling around.
[00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.871]  It's literal conditioning.
[00:35:23.151 --> 00:35:29.115]  That's one of the best forms of, you know, to mesmerize and brainwash is that makes somebody feel special and powerful and in a good mood.
[00:35:31.876 --> 00:35:32.957]  And they've done that with them.
[00:35:34.159 --> 00:35:41.566]  As they run around playing dress-up in their little costumes, the average American with their baubles and trinkets and signets and standards.
[00:35:43.948 --> 00:35:50.795]  But if you really listen to NPR and you read globalist manuals and you see what they say, they say, these spoiled pig-like Americans.
[00:35:51.463 --> 00:35:55.586]  They've had it too good, too long, and they've held up the global order too long.
[00:35:55.606 --> 00:36:06.272]  We're going to run them up in debt, get them completely dependent, get them on welfare, brainwash them, brainwash their kids, break up their families, and then we're going to totally enslave them.
[00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:10.635]  And then we're going to run what we ran in Russia and Germany and China on them.
[00:36:10.795 --> 00:36:11.696]  Yeah!
[00:36:12.677 --> 00:36:13.637]  Yeah!
[00:36:13.777 --> 00:36:16.439]  I mean, that's literally the whole attitude of it.
[00:36:16.899 --> 00:36:19.441]  Meanwhile, the yuppies are just giggling and laughing and
[00:36:20.017 --> 00:36:24.659]  Stumbling around everywhere, loving it while these predators just circle them.
[00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:28.820]  Just getting everything lined up, everything ready.
[00:36:29.301 --> 00:36:33.442]  Sharp, keen, eyes filled with demoniac genius.
[00:36:33.962 --> 00:36:39.444]  While the yuppies just stumble around with goblets of wine going, ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:36:39.784 --> 00:36:41.305]  I mean, that's basically what it is.
[00:36:45.186 --> 00:36:46.207]  That's what we face.
[00:36:47.879 --> 00:36:50.621]  And here is Dick Cheney speaking of the lizard stare.
[00:36:51.161 --> 00:36:54.523]  Cheney urging strikes on Iran.
[00:36:54.543 --> 00:36:57.285]  McClatchy Newspapers up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:36:57.746 --> 00:37:03.429]  President Bush charged Thursday that Iran continues to arm and train insurgents who are killing U.S.
[00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:06.912]  soldiers in Iraq and he threatened action if that continues.
[00:37:07.932 --> 00:37:14.857]  At a news conference, Bush said Iran had been warned of unspecified consequences
[00:37:15.603 --> 00:37:17.784]  They've already told them three years ago, nuke attack.
[00:37:18.344 --> 00:37:21.446]  We will preemptively nuke you if you dare to defend yourself.
[00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:24.527]  It will be called terrorism and you will be nuked more.
[00:37:25.068 --> 00:37:26.688]  And Americans go, yeah!
[00:37:27.509 --> 00:37:28.389]  Yeah!
[00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.550]  Kill em!
[00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:32.271]  But they can't find it on the map.
[00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:35.933]  It's just, they know how to go parking lot!
[00:37:36.973 --> 00:37:42.556]  Yeah, you think that same global system that'll parking lot an innocent country won't parking lot you?
[00:37:42.796 --> 00:37:44.077]  You think they care one
[00:37:45.243 --> 00:37:47.484]  Read, sent about your hide?
[00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:51.867]  You will soon learn, won't you?
[00:37:53.048 --> 00:38:04.634]  At a news conference Thursday, Bush said Iran had been warned of unspecified consequences if it continued its alleged support for anti-American forces in Iraq.
[00:38:05.255 --> 00:38:05.555]  U.S.
[00:38:05.635 --> 00:38:09.137]  Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Croker,
[00:38:10.197 --> 00:38:14.380]  ...had conveyed the warning in meetings with the Iranian counterpart in Baghdad.
[00:38:14.721 --> 00:38:21.486]  The President said Bush wasn't specific, and the State Department official refused to elaborate on it in writing.
[00:38:23.948 --> 00:38:37.078]  Behind the scenes, however, the President's top aides have been engaged in an intensive internal debate over how to respond to Iran's support for Shiite Muslim groups in Iraq and its nuclear program.
[00:38:37.518 --> 00:38:39.400]  I mean, at least McClatchy said it was Shiite.
[00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:48.918]  Fox, CNN, others, Limbaugh, it'll be their support of Al-Qaeda, which is the opposite of Shiite.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:58.605]  Vice President Dick Cheney several weeks ago proposed launching airstrikes at suspected training camps in Iraq run by
[00:38:59.739 --> 00:39:05.003]  Quad Force, a special unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, according to two U.S.
[00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:08.025]  officials who were involved in Iran policy.
[00:39:08.286 --> 00:39:11.568]  Yeah, kind of like they had Ahmed Dinejad here earlier this week.
[00:39:12.709 --> 00:39:13.970]  Not Ahmed Dinejad.
[00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:16.512]  Dinejad, how do you pronounce it?
[00:39:17.032 --> 00:39:17.512]  I'm all mixed up.
[00:39:17.553 --> 00:39:19.114]  That's the Iranian puppet president.
[00:39:20.154 --> 00:39:22.016]  Mohammad Karzai, the UNICOR executive.
[00:39:24.073 --> 00:39:24.773]  Afghanistan.
[00:39:24.973 --> 00:39:53.466]  And then he said about Mohammed Karzai, they're at a press conference, and Bush is like, they're helping Al Qaeda, they're attacking our forces, and... You know, this is the guy, even though he's a puppet, he lives there, he knows how ridiculous it is when this is going to be on TV, uh, and because they do have some TV satellite at the end, in Afghanistan, the major cities, and how ridiculous it's going to be in Iran, and Pakistan, and surrounding areas, and he goes, well, um, respectfully, um, actually, Iran's got some problems, but they're actually helping us against the Wahhabist, uh,
[00:39:54.649 --> 00:40:01.931]  He even said, they're Shiite, and it's the Sunnis that are backing it out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:40:02.871 --> 00:40:05.831]  And Bush went, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're with Al Qaeda!
[00:40:07.192 --> 00:40:23.935]  And Karzai just shut up and looked embarrassed, because again, from over there, even though he's a globalist, former executive, a unicorn, a puppet, he knows in the Arab and Muslim and Central Asian world, it'd be like coming here and saying,
[00:40:25.752 --> 00:40:27.213]  Strom Thurmond is president.
[00:40:27.513 --> 00:40:31.296]  You know, he's been dead for years, but it'd be like saying the 99-year-old Strom Thurmond is president.
[00:40:32.077 --> 00:40:35.559]  And Cargis got to say, actually, he's not president.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.861]  I mean, over there, they're going, what?
[00:40:38.401 --> 00:40:42.484]  Iran is with the Wahhabist and the Pashtuns?
[00:40:44.406 --> 00:40:44.686]  What?
[00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:52.606]  So, see, I mean, it's just the lies are so incredible that even Mohammed Karzai is going, what?
[00:40:52.686 --> 00:40:57.407]  What does he... You're not from yuppie land, bro!
[00:40:57.727 --> 00:41:03.748]  The great-great-great-grandchildren are the real men that beat the biggest empire in the world.
[00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:06.529]  And so they had incredible wealth and incredible power.
[00:41:06.849 --> 00:41:08.949]  These are the chicken-neck scum!
[00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:12.090]  They'll buy and be told anything!
[00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:17.331]  They'll put their children in brainwashing camps and let them shoot them up full of mercury.
[00:41:19.196 --> 00:41:31.487]  Until we get tens of thousands of percentile increases, and I forget the number, it's official government numbers, 1 in 125,000, 20-something years ago, to now 1 in 74, the new numbers came out by the way, it was 168, 1 in 168, and below 168 now it's 1 in 70-something.
[00:41:42.552 --> 00:41:47.075]  Warehouses of them where you go to see a children's movie and there's a whole front row filled with autistic children.
[00:41:47.376 --> 00:41:48.737]  The injectors just continue.
[00:41:50.017 --> 00:41:52.960]  The public continues to dance around feeling important and smart.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:58.944]  Dumb cops continue to run around radaring and sucking off people right next to letting illegal aliens go.
[00:41:59.773 --> 00:42:02.354]  Again, that's just such a sign of a country gone.
[00:42:02.594 --> 00:42:06.115]  Bridges collapsing all over the place in Arizona and Minnesota.
[00:42:06.135 --> 00:42:08.615]  Just scum running around in the streets.
[00:42:08.955 --> 00:42:10.596]  Filth stealing everywhere.
[00:42:11.256 --> 00:42:12.336]  Bid rigging.
[00:42:12.776 --> 00:42:15.717]  Pension funds being grabbed and snatched everywhere.
[00:42:15.977 --> 00:42:19.858]  Just gibbering idiot populations running around mindlessly.
[00:42:19.878 --> 00:42:23.579]  I mean, that's really what it is, folks.
[00:42:26.059 --> 00:42:29.060]  A bunch of self-important, know-it-all idiots.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.482]  You know absolutely zero about how the real world works.
[00:42:34.842 --> 00:42:36.483]  You know less than zero!
[00:42:38.724 --> 00:42:44.107]  Your information is backwards, so backwards that it's actually less than zero.
[00:42:45.628 --> 00:42:47.609]  Somebody who knows zero, you can at least teach.
[00:42:48.909 --> 00:42:51.611]  You're a bunch of arrogant jackasses.
[00:42:52.471 --> 00:42:58.154]  I'm talking to yuppies and know-it-alls and liberals and la reconquistas and all of you, just all of you.
[00:42:58.667 --> 00:43:01.028]  You think you know it all, you don't know nothing!
[00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:07.472]  And you are the biggest reason you're gonna live in a hell pit.
[00:43:07.873 --> 00:43:09.153]  I just want you to know that.
[00:43:09.493 --> 00:43:17.658]  The one time you're driving along listening to us on the AM dial, out in the middle of nowhere in some city, you just go ahead and laugh, you slack-jawed scum.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.001]  You just go ahead and laugh.
[00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:26.443]  Because you've helped kill this country!
[00:43:26.923 --> 00:43:28.805]  And you love it!
[00:43:29.305 --> 00:43:32.508]  You love evil, and you love chicken neck weakness!
[00:43:36.311 --> 00:43:37.451]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:39.873]  Jonathan in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:43:41.455 --> 00:43:41.995]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:42.435 --> 00:43:43.796]  Hi, go ahead, yeah.
[00:43:43.836 --> 00:43:50.982]  Yes, I've been studying the Wall Street for the last couple of weeks, and noticed it went down this last week.
[00:43:51.643 --> 00:43:53.304]  I read, I think, an article
[00:43:54.415 --> 00:43:55.696]  I don't know.
[00:44:16.801 --> 00:44:19.364]  Actually help pump it up even more with inflation.
[00:44:19.784 --> 00:44:21.206]  Okay, I appreciate your call.
[00:44:21.947 --> 00:44:26.451]  It's kind of like this when they tell you, you have the choice of how you're going to be executed.
[00:44:26.932 --> 00:44:28.734]  Would you like to be drawn and quartered?
[00:44:30.015 --> 00:44:32.178]  Or would you like to be boiled in oil?
[00:44:32.578 --> 00:44:34.380]  Or would you like to be crucified upside down?
[00:44:35.459 --> 00:44:37.640]  Go ahead and choose.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.420]  Yes, this is the problem.
[00:44:39.921 --> 00:45:03.489]  The elite and the dominant media a year ago, a year and a half ago now, man, time flies, started going, real estate's overvalued, real estate's overvalued, it really should go down, and I went, uh-oh, that means they're pulling the plug, oh my gosh, and sure enough, Financial Times of London, which is the key place to read, not the Wall Street Journal, especially now with Murdoch owning it,
[00:45:04.469 --> 00:45:07.450]  I started saying that they were going to slowly bring down the U.S.
[00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.830]  forever.
[00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:09.490]  And that was the public plan.
[00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.291]  I mean, it was right there.
[00:45:11.331 --> 00:45:16.572]  Of course, the yuppies watch Cavuto and feel very smart and important, so they don't know.
[00:45:17.552 --> 00:45:20.773]  And why were they trying to do that?
[00:45:20.813 --> 00:45:22.814]  Because, yes, real estate was overvalued.
[00:45:22.914 --> 00:45:24.414]  Many times, double, triple what it was worth.
[00:45:25.314 --> 00:45:27.835]  But at least there was some tangible value.
[00:45:29.515 --> 00:45:30.096]  I don't know.
[00:45:41.084 --> 00:45:46.309]  One of the last major currency sinks, because they were overprinting currency like it was coming.
[00:45:46.890 --> 00:46:02.366]  In the last six years of his tenure, Greenspan doubled the money supply, then Bernanke, helicopter Bernanke, Ben Bernanke, the new Fed Chief, announced he was going to double it in the next two years, and then made the M3 money supply, global supply, secret for the first time since the Bretton Woods Agreement.
[00:46:03.855 --> 00:46:05.316]  And that gets into currency history.
[00:46:05.356 --> 00:46:07.117]  You can do research and learn more if you want, folks.
[00:46:07.517 --> 00:46:20.384]  And so when I saw that, and then about four months ago, the Fed put out feelers and made the announcement that, OK, we're going to now stop the massive issuance of credit and massively slow down the printing presses.
[00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:32.471]  And I went, oh, they're trying to pop the real estate bubble, which has got some or at least real value and was keeping inflation under control because that was the main driver of inflation, that and energy.
[00:46:33.044 --> 00:46:35.586]  You know, oil doubles, real estate doubles on average.
[00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:37.887]  You know, okay, but that isn't everything doubling.
[00:46:38.688 --> 00:46:42.631]  So they tried to control it, and then they just pulled the plug and said, okay, let it all go up.
[00:46:42.691 --> 00:46:46.754]  Let the inflationary spike happen, and we're going to restrict credit.
[00:46:47.214 --> 00:46:49.756]  So they're doing it by policy.
[00:46:50.836 --> 00:46:53.338]  They first decided to weaken the dollar six years ago.
[00:46:53.979 --> 00:46:55.920]  At least they announced the decision five years ago.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.241]  The decision was made before that.
[00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:04.553]  Then they start bringing the dollar down gradually, but at least they allowed you to get into real estate and have some tangible, you know, something left.
[00:47:04.794 --> 00:47:13.678]  Then they're trying to pop that to create some mass run, which will cause an even deeper default and then an even bigger consolidation.
[00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:17.540]  It's pretty cold-blooded, isn't it?
[00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:26.865]  And then the very people openly behind all of it will now pose as saviors, and, I mean, it's the sickest part of my life.
[00:47:27.754 --> 00:47:35.457]  We'll have to watch those accountable, those who did it, pose as savers and be loved, and sell best-selling books about how it all happened.
[00:47:35.497 --> 00:47:36.497]  It'll all be lies, of course.
[00:47:37.458 --> 00:47:52.623]  And then we'll have to see all the know-it-all class at the gym or at church, you know who I'm talking about, babbling in the good old boy round circle, all repeating what they read in the Wall Street Journal to each other like they're real smart.
[00:47:53.843 --> 00:47:55.164]  Oh, it's so sick.
[00:47:56.343 --> 00:47:58.844]  And I literally just want to walk up and start knocking their teeth out.
[00:47:58.904 --> 00:48:00.845]  Oh, you think you're a tough guy and real smart.
[00:48:01.145 --> 00:48:05.687]  Got the clean cut haircut and the fancy suit and you drive around, you like the war.
[00:48:05.827 --> 00:48:06.788]  Here, you like this?
[00:48:07.068 --> 00:48:08.728]  Well, here goes your teeth in your throat!
[00:48:09.149 --> 00:48:13.310]  Because you people wouldn't wake up when we could have averted this!
[00:48:14.871 --> 00:48:17.352]  You people had to let them bring this country down!
[00:48:17.472 --> 00:48:18.993]  You pieces of filth!
[00:48:19.773 --> 00:48:22.034]  Oh, I'd like to get my hands around your necks!
[00:48:23.815 --> 00:48:24.035]  Huh.
[00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:26.204]  Hold on, I'm not going to get mad.
[00:48:28.548 --> 00:48:30.912]  They're killing the country right in front of us!
[00:48:31.533 --> 00:48:32.595]  And they think it's funny!
[00:48:36.264 --> 00:48:40.846]  And these sitcom punks running around on the internet deleting all of our information and lying about us.
[00:48:41.667 --> 00:48:46.629]  It's always the same mantra as about tinfoil hats and how we support the Muslim extremists.
[00:48:47.269 --> 00:48:54.233]  I'm not the one that brought the lawsuit against the Saudis for the 9-11 victims, you scumbag sitcom traitors!
[00:48:54.493 --> 00:48:55.493]  Listen right now!
[00:48:56.134 --> 00:48:58.955]  I hate you, you un-American scum of hell!
[00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:04.291]  Let me tell you, when we take this country back, you're all gonna be arrested.
[00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:09.474]  You think you're gonna take our guns and push us around, you maggot-eating scum?
[00:49:10.174 --> 00:49:12.956]  We're gonna rise up and get our hands around your throat!
[00:49:14.357 --> 00:49:16.738]  I'm tired of the New World Order running roughshod over us!
[00:49:17.098 --> 00:49:21.401]  And I'm tired of an army of waddling fake Christians that back them up!
[00:49:22.081 --> 00:49:22.922]  I'm sick of it!
[00:49:28.445 --> 00:49:28.785]  Alright.
[00:49:31.863 --> 00:49:33.404]  All right, I'm getting particularly angry today.
[00:49:33.564 --> 00:49:40.189]  It's just, it's just, you know, they'll jack the market back up and there'll be a bunch of moneying for a few weeks or months and then it'll go back down again.
[00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:44.992]  And they'll just continue to suck off everybody and you'll just continue to love it and thank them.
[00:49:45.112 --> 00:49:47.513]  Oh, thank you for all the horrible things you do.
[00:49:47.593 --> 00:49:52.194]  Dimecore and Halliburton will continue to run their abominable operations in front of everyone.
[00:49:52.754 --> 00:50:10.258]  The war will continue to drag on forever and millions of abortions and fat preachers up there on TV openly spouting all sorts of occult garbage on people and they'll just be supping it up and all the mindless little weak-kneed church ladies who love evil and don't even know it when they see it.
[00:50:19.033 --> 00:50:21.054]  You're gonna have to lose everything you've got.
[00:50:21.074 --> 00:50:24.235]  You're gonna have to be in work camps until you remember.
[00:50:25.116 --> 00:50:26.156]  And then most of you won't even then.
[00:50:26.176 --> 00:50:29.698]  You'll tattle on each other and scrimp and do whatever they tell you just to get by.
[00:50:29.718 --> 00:50:31.779]  A lot of you are gonna love camp life.
[00:50:32.359 --> 00:50:35.641]  It's the exact type of place scum like you wanna be.
[00:50:38.322 --> 00:50:41.023]  Because your parents were cowards and scum.
[00:50:41.484 --> 00:50:43.745]  And their parents were cowards and scum.
[00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:46.426]  You're the scum of the scum!
[00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:49.101]  We'll be right back, stay with me!
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:10.142]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.523 --> 00:51:18.146]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.843 --> 00:51:25.906]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.306 --> 00:51:37.731]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.031 --> 00:51:41.533]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.013 --> 00:51:43.934]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.274 --> 00:51:48.036]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:04.761]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.801 --> 00:52:08.843]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.963 --> 00:52:11.525]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.605 --> 00:52:13.926]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:14.126 --> 00:52:22.571]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.631 --> 00:52:23.952]  The brookie light is different.
[00:52:24.072 --> 00:52:28.114]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:28.174 --> 00:52:28.814]  We're good to go!

[00:52:53.211 --> 00:52:54.151]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.815 --> 00:53:02.435]  Morning, neighbor!
[00:53:02.455 --> 00:53:04.497]  Hey, shouldn't you be at work?
[00:53:04.917 --> 00:53:05.237]  I am.
[00:53:05.497 --> 00:53:07.499]  As a matter of fact, I pulled another all-nighter.
[00:53:07.699 --> 00:53:08.339]  What do you mean?
[00:53:08.359 --> 00:53:11.441]  Well, I'm working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:53:11.701 --> 00:53:13.823]  Well, at least I'm making money 24-7.
[00:53:13.983 --> 00:53:15.124]  But I never have to go to work.
[00:53:15.424 --> 00:53:16.344]  So, what do you do?
[00:53:16.644 --> 00:53:17.765]  Not very much at all now.
[00:53:18.045 --> 00:53:19.827]  About a month ago, I heard about this website.
[00:53:19.847 --> 00:53:20.747]  It's got a funny name.
[00:53:20.807 --> 00:53:23.529]  It's DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:53:23.869 --> 00:53:24.710]  That is funny.
[00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:29.734]  Yeah, you can earn $1,200 to $12,000 a week starting the very first week.
[00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:32.356]  Oh, is that how you bought that new mower?
[00:53:32.536 --> 00:53:35.258]  Yeah, and the motorcycle I've always wanted, too.
[00:53:35.439 --> 00:53:36.119]  You should log on.
[00:53:36.259 --> 00:53:38.141]  Find out how you can become financially free.
[00:53:38.321 --> 00:53:39.782]  So, what was that website?
[00:53:39.862 --> 00:53:46.868]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com Just wait, I'll go get a pen so I can write that down.
[00:53:47.208 --> 00:53:48.249]  You don't need to write it down.
[00:53:48.289 --> 00:53:49.189]  It's easy to remember.
[00:53:49.409 --> 00:53:52.791]  DidYouRobBillGates.com Yeah!
[00:53:53.111 --> 00:53:56.773]  DidYouRobBillGates.com That is easy!
[00:53:57.093 --> 00:53:59.814]  It's easy, and the money is awesome!
[00:54:01.595 --> 00:54:05.397]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:10.140]  No matter how hard...
[00:54:37.469 --> 00:54:38.270]  Welcome back!
[00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:58.852]  Alright, I'm going to go to your calls, and I really am mad.
[00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:00.373]  They're killing our country.
[00:55:00.573 --> 00:55:01.614]  They're killing our borders.
[00:55:01.915 --> 00:55:04.977]  They have 30 million illegal aliens running all over the place in Mexican flags.
[00:55:05.398 --> 00:55:08.861]  Forcing people out of houses that don't speak English, out of businesses, out of communities.
[00:55:09.081 --> 00:55:10.802]  There's like five articles a day on it.
[00:55:11.183 --> 00:55:12.444]  The whole country's falling apart.
[00:55:12.484 --> 00:55:14.005]  The dollar's been plunged by design.
[00:55:14.265 --> 00:55:15.386]  Criminals run the government.
[00:55:15.626 --> 00:55:18.389]  They're talking about staging more terror attacks, going into Iran.
[00:55:19.671 --> 00:55:23.494]  The neocons write headlines about how we need more 9-11's and how 9-11's wonderful.
[00:55:23.514 --> 00:55:25.535]  I mean, these people are sick, man!
[00:55:26.015 --> 00:55:26.896]  We're in danger!
[00:55:27.616 --> 00:55:31.979]  And I just get in an angry mode because my primitive side knows this is fighting time.
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.622]  But I've got to remember it's the info war that we're all about here.
[00:55:37.023 --> 00:55:37.583]  Oh, man.
[00:55:37.603 --> 00:55:40.065]  I just, I just, we can't let them get away with it.
[00:55:41.346 --> 00:55:45.789]  We've got to get more aggressive in our fight against the globalists than we've ever gotten.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:52.361]  And we've got to send them a strong message that we're not going along with them and let them know we're not going along with it.
[00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:59.703]  There's a reason they haven't done their mass killing here, ladies and gentlemen, and that's because we've got guns and we don't put up with that type of bull.
[00:56:00.543 --> 00:56:03.223]  They believe me, that's why they want to do it here so bad they can taste it.
[00:56:03.843 --> 00:56:05.744]  You look at the map of the world, they've done it everywhere else.
[00:56:06.144 --> 00:56:07.564]  They're not going to get away with it here.
[00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:11.725]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Tampa, Florida.
[00:56:11.745 --> 00:56:12.445]  You're on the air, Chris.
[00:56:13.524 --> 00:56:25.504]  First question, since the dollar is being killed, do you think that we would have more time to distract the blame from whatever the, of course,
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.061]  Arabs would be blamed.
[00:56:28.081 --> 00:56:38.669]  But do we have time to shift the blame or to demonstrate the fact that the economy has taken such a severe hit right now rather than after a huge terrorist attack?
[00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:42.191]  Well, people act like the economy is magical and can't be figured out.
[00:56:42.211 --> 00:56:44.073]  We need articles on prisonatlanta.com.
[00:56:44.493 --> 00:56:46.314]  I'm so busy I haven't had time to write them last week.
[00:56:46.334 --> 00:56:49.637]  I've been out of my own little small way of putting out the facts of how this works.
[00:56:49.957 --> 00:56:51.278]  I've laid it out over and over again.
[00:56:52.213 --> 00:56:54.354]  Waddy and Steve need to get one out on them.
[00:56:54.374 --> 00:56:55.374]  They've been working great.
[00:56:55.895 --> 00:56:57.135]  Somebody else wants to write it up.
[00:56:57.755 --> 00:56:59.636]  I mean, George Humphrey needs to write one up or someone.
[00:56:59.656 --> 00:57:03.017]  We've got Joseph Stickel explaining a year ago on the show what they were doing by design.
[00:57:03.037 --> 00:57:04.718]  I don't know how else to explain it.
[00:57:04.758 --> 00:57:06.239]  I mean, they set the policies.
[00:57:06.279 --> 00:57:06.759]  They did it.
[00:57:07.259 --> 00:57:08.280]  They're doing it right now.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.881]  And we helped by going along with it.
[00:57:11.901 --> 00:57:12.801]  The American people did.
[00:57:14.955 --> 00:57:22.026]  Maybe they're accelerating the process because of Ron Paul running and, of course, he's just one factor of many.
[00:57:22.107 --> 00:57:24.350]  Well, he is educating people about the inflation tax.
[00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:25.532]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:25.592 --> 00:57:29.098]  So, I mean, using him as a vehicle to explain to people.
[00:57:30.082 --> 00:57:35.487]  Another question I had was a caller to your weekend show brought up the international driver's license.
[00:57:35.527 --> 00:57:40.130]  I'd like to know what kind of websites or companies are good and reputable for who offer that?
[00:57:40.411 --> 00:57:42.232]  Well, I mean, I'm not going to sit here and recommend.
[00:57:42.753 --> 00:57:43.693]  It's very dangerous.
[00:57:45.114 --> 00:57:52.981]  By dangerous, I mean you can get ripped off getting an international driver's license and there's a process and I'm not going to sit here and tell everybody exactly how to do it or why to do it.
[00:57:53.081 --> 00:57:54.362]  I've only read about it a few times.
[00:57:54.722 --> 00:57:56.443]  Had a few guests on about it years ago.
[00:57:56.843 --> 00:57:59.704]  I know more than most about it, but just because most know nothing about it.
[00:58:00.064 --> 00:58:01.545]  So I'm not really an expert on that.
[00:58:01.605 --> 00:58:02.806]  I know I've read the U.S.
[00:58:02.866 --> 00:58:04.026]  law, the U.N.
[00:58:04.086 --> 00:58:12.250]  treaty we have, about how they've got to accept the, uh, I know you used to get a good one from Belize, but the federal government put pressure on them not to issue those.
[00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:14.571]  Now you can still get them from a few other countries.
[00:58:15.011 --> 00:58:16.271]  It's all selectively enforced.
[00:58:16.291 --> 00:58:20.153]  If you're an illegal alien, uh, you can have a fake driver's license that's accepted.
[00:58:20.675 --> 00:58:24.458]  If you're a citizen, they're gonna slam your head in the concrete and say, YOU'RE MY SLAVE!
[00:58:24.718 --> 00:58:25.759]  YOU'RE MY SLAVE!
[00:58:26.019 --> 00:58:27.120]  YOU'RE MY COW!
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.461]  YOU'RE MY SCUM!
[00:58:28.721 --> 00:58:30.402]  Yes, I mean, that's basically the attitude.
[00:58:30.703 --> 00:58:31.623]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:58:32.184 --> 00:58:33.605]  We are the fat hogs!
[00:58:33.725 --> 00:58:34.646]  We are the scum!
[00:58:34.866 --> 00:58:36.067]  That's what they've trained us to be!
[00:58:41.611 --> 00:58:45.514]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.834 --> 00:58:46.635]  Or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.001 --> 00:59:02.202]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:59:02.842 --> 00:59:03.663]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.423 --> 00:59:05.343]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.983 --> 00:59:09.664]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.164 --> 00:59:14.306]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.328 --> 00:59:26.549]  Coming up in a few minutes, we're scheduled to have
[00:59:28.055 --> 00:59:39.019]  Kent Snyder, the campaign director for Ron Paul 2008 presidential run and we're going to talk about the straw poll coming up, how important that is, what's going on right now.
[00:59:39.039 --> 00:59:41.820]  We're going to also be talking about
[00:59:43.425 --> 00:59:50.967]  Ron Paul gaining momentum now, even the mainstream media is having to admit that he is becoming a first-tier candidate, even though they've tried to censor him.
[00:59:51.447 --> 00:59:53.827]  And joining us is Ken Schneider for this segment and the next.
[00:59:54.408 --> 00:59:56.588]  Ken, thanks for spending time with us out of your busy schedule.
[00:59:56.808 --> 00:59:58.168]  Sure, happy to be with you, thank you.
[01:00:01.189 --> 01:00:09.251]  There's so much to discuss, but first off, the straw poll, how important is that, and can you explain to people out there that don't understand how this works, why this is so important?
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:17.628]  Well, it is important because it really is a first test for the political candidate to kind of gauge popularity or how the campaigns are going.
[01:00:17.668 --> 01:00:20.330]  It's not absolutely critical, but it is important.
[01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:26.897]  Dr. Paul and his wife and campaign staffers and volunteers are working very hard this week to have a good showing.
[01:00:27.838 --> 01:00:29.760]  It will happen tomorrow in Ames from 10 to 6.
[01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:40.931]  And an Iowa resident can come to the poll and take advantage of the speeches and the food and all that sort of thing, and then before they leave, cast a ballot.
[01:00:41.412 --> 01:00:50.161]  The ballots will be counted after that, and the results will be announced at 7 o'clock Saturday evening.
[01:00:51.162 --> 01:00:58.306]  Now, I agree with you that it's not absolutely essential, but the media acts like it's the most important thing since the second coming or whatever.
[01:00:59.067 --> 01:01:09.754]  But there's also been discussions now, and I wanted to find out this headline about, there's also talk of extortion in the upcoming vote of the Ron Paul campaign.
[01:01:10.054 --> 01:01:17.239]  That's what one news site had, that if people wanted a recount of some of the votes that are coming up, that you guys had to pay $180-something thousand dollars.
[01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:18.380]  Can you fill us in on that?
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.004]  Yeah, well, we inquired about that.
[01:01:21.024 --> 01:01:27.376]  I mean, we're mindful that the so-called Diebold machines that they're going to be using are in question.
[01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:31.123]  I mean, Florida and California just recently decertified them.
[01:01:31.947 --> 01:01:33.327]  So that is an open question.
[01:01:33.787 --> 01:01:35.728]  It's not even an open question, respectfully, sir.
[01:01:35.768 --> 01:01:37.528]  They've decertified them.
[01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:38.468]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:01:38.488 --> 01:01:39.549]  I should be more accurate.
[01:01:39.609 --> 01:01:44.530]  But then Professor Jones from the University of Iowa talked on the Jan Michelson Show the other day.
[01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:48.951]  So we have made it clear to the party that we're concerned about it.
[01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.451]  We've expressed concern.
[01:01:51.091 --> 01:01:57.432]  We do have people on the ground to try to make sure that things are handled properly.
[01:01:57.972 --> 01:01:59.213]  We certainly hope they will be.
[01:02:01.113 --> 01:02:13.597]  You know, until it actually happens, we're a little bit limited on what we can do, but we are mindful of it, and we have our attorney on the ground there to supervise it, to represent Dr. Paul and all the supporters.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:25.349]  We're going to break here in about a minute and come right back, Kent, with another segment and then whatever you think is most important because the listeners are always asking what is the most important thing we can do for the campaign.
[01:02:25.369 --> 01:02:28.752]  But just going into the break, really, how can we help?
[01:02:29.052 --> 01:02:31.694]  Because I get calls every day, emails, you know, how do we help?
[01:02:31.754 --> 01:02:38.740]  And I say get a yard sign, get a t-shirt, go to the campaign website, contribute, but also email your friends, send them YouTube videos.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.723]  I mean, is that the most important thing to do or is there something else?
[01:02:44.182 --> 01:02:52.808]  There's so many different things people can do that they should simply think about it and do what they think is the most exciting, the most fun, the most productive or what they enjoy doing.
[01:02:53.248 --> 01:03:09.679]  I will say that be it anyone, any of your listeners who know people in Iowa, the most important thing they could do within the next 12 hours is to encourage friends or family who live in Iowa to attend the Straw Poll because we're doing quite a bit of that and that will have an effect.
[01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:16.669]  Everything that you've mentioned is great, but if people know people in Iowa, call them up and ask them and encourage them to get to the straw poll.
[01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:19.012]  Absolutely.
[01:03:19.372 --> 01:03:29.455]  I mean, folks, if you've never been involved in politics, and you know, just vote every few years, if you live in Iowa, you need to get down and vote in this straw poll for Ron Paul.
[01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:35.117]  And for those that live, you live in Florida, and you've got a second cousin who you see every five years at family reunions.
[01:03:35.557 --> 01:03:37.757]  Get on the phone, call him up, get the Rolodex out.
[01:03:38.057 --> 01:03:41.518]  Call Grandma if you don't have that phone number, and call Billy in Iowa.
[01:03:41.578 --> 01:03:42.719]  Call Carol in Iowa.
[01:03:42.759 --> 01:03:43.679]  Call Jim in Iowa.
[01:03:44.039 --> 01:03:46.140]  And say, get into that straw poll and vote for Ron Paul.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.260]  Stay there.
[01:03:48.506 --> 01:04:02.057]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.437 --> 01:04:10.043]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.754 --> 01:04:17.798]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.218 --> 01:04:29.664]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.944 --> 01:04:33.626]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.907 --> 01:04:35.868]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.168 --> 01:04:40.030]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.143]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:05:53.189 --> 01:05:54.871]  Hey Emily, wow you look great!
[01:05:55.555 --> 01:05:56.356]  I feel great!
[01:05:56.596 --> 01:05:58.497]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:05:58.897 --> 01:05:59.217]  Really?
[01:05:59.317 --> 01:05:59.878]  What is it?
[01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:00.438]  How does it work?
[01:06:00.578 --> 01:06:07.543]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[01:06:07.843 --> 01:06:10.124]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:06:10.485 --> 01:06:15.608]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:06:16.128 --> 01:06:16.589]  That's it?
[01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:18.430]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:19.431]  It is easy.
[01:06:19.732 --> 01:06:26.378]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:06:26.658 --> 01:06:27.999]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:06:28.199 --> 01:06:28.980]  That's amazing!
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:34.665]  And, the bendonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:06:34.925 --> 01:06:35.226]  Wow!
[01:06:35.406 --> 01:06:36.487]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:06:36.907 --> 01:06:39.929]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:43.912]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[01:06:44.112 --> 01:06:44.492]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[01:06:44.512 --> 01:06:44.732]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:06:54.381 --> 01:06:56.586]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.606 --> 01:06:59.932]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.854 --> 01:07:09.295]  Kent Schneider is our guest.
[01:07:09.355 --> 01:07:18.218]  I want to talk about the campaign, the strategy, Ron Paul's message of we shouldn't have this inflation tax, which is now becoming more evident than ever.
[01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:30.782]  Ron Paul was on with us about a month ago and talked about if there's a major financial collapse, which he doesn't want to happen, but he said could happen sooner rather than later, that that could really become a boon for the campaign as reality and the chickens come home.
[01:07:31.683 --> 01:07:35.164]  Kent Schneider, though, you know, the big ABC debate Sunday,
[01:07:36.115 --> 01:07:38.799]  They didn't play it up like they played up Democratic debates.
[01:07:38.839 --> 01:07:39.740]  It was early in the morning.
[01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:44.794]  I would say it was the least viewed in the number show that debate so far.
[01:07:45.715 --> 01:07:48.997]  But Ron Paul, again, I was watching it real time as it happened.
[01:07:49.377 --> 01:07:50.498]  He had a few thousand votes.
[01:07:50.538 --> 01:07:51.379]  They erased his votes.
[01:07:51.399 --> 01:07:52.259]  He got a few thousand more.
[01:07:52.279 --> 01:07:52.940]  They erased them again.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.140]  People threw fits.
[01:07:54.561 --> 01:07:58.484]  Suddenly the numbers exploded and he got, what, 90 plus percent of the vote.
[01:07:59.004 --> 01:08:01.386]  You know, twenty-something thousand, dwarfing everyone else.
[01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:04.568]  And that's an IP vote where you only get to vote once per computer.
[01:08:04.928 --> 01:08:07.070]  Believe me, folks, I tested it out and tried to vote twice.
[01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:07.570]  It didn't let me.
[01:08:08.391 --> 01:08:09.331]  But I did that as a test.
[01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:10.192]  I don't cheat.
[01:08:11.272 --> 01:08:20.716]  And he's won the Tex Polls, he's won all the other major polls until that Fox thing after, you know, suddenly they closed the poll and then he lost by three points second place.
[01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:33.462]  And then we saw ABC News framing one lone Ron Paul supporter outside and then we had video of Ron Paul supporters at least two to one, probably three to one against everybody else.
[01:08:33.782 --> 01:08:38.204]  So we have massive misrepresentation blocking him out of a lot of the polls.
[01:08:39.947 --> 01:08:41.230]  We were just talking about that during the break.
[01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:45.961]  You told one story and you told another about some of the things you guys have been doing behind the scenes.
[01:08:45.981 --> 01:08:47.344]  Can you share that with the listeners?
[01:08:47.893 --> 01:09:02.258]  Well, yeah, I mean, just this morning, the NPR station out of Boston had a report on the upcoming straw poll, and they had everybody's campaign website listed on the report except for Ron Paul's.
[01:09:02.458 --> 01:09:05.299]  And about 45 minutes later, they added it.
[01:09:05.339 --> 01:09:09.660]  So some people have been calling that station in Boston to say, well, why are you admitting Dr. Paul?
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:15.702]  Admitting Dr. Paul, you're correct in terms of the characterization about these polls that Dr. Paul wins time and time again.
[01:09:16.292 --> 01:09:17.713]  I was there, obviously, at the debate.
[01:09:17.833 --> 01:09:21.615]  It was raining cats and dogs before the debate started.
[01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:23.176]  We drove up.
[01:09:23.236 --> 01:09:25.137]  The Ron Paul supporters were out there.
[01:09:25.177 --> 01:09:31.680]  They were getting absolutely drenched, completely soaked, waving signs, very enthusiastic, happy to be there, waving at Dr. Paul.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.282]  And they stood there all the way through the debate, 90 minutes in rain.
[01:09:35.302 --> 01:09:37.203]  I mean, it was raining unbelievably hard.
[01:09:37.783 --> 01:09:38.424]  And they were there.
[01:09:38.464 --> 01:09:39.485]  No one else was there.
[01:09:39.585 --> 01:09:41.446]  So it really is sad.
[01:09:41.486 --> 01:09:48.392]  It's not justice for the supporters who stood there in the rain for a couple of hours and then the networks just omitted.
[01:09:48.513 --> 01:09:54.538]  And like you say, they are setting aside the results of their own polls, which is, you can't be more obvious than that.
[01:09:55.808 --> 01:10:02.994]  Well, there's also this claim that there's literally three hackers eating Hot Pockets in their underwear who are twelve years old in a basement.
[01:10:03.034 --> 01:10:03.455]  No, no, no.
[01:10:03.855 --> 01:10:07.398]  I know mainline Republicans here in Austin who've got Ron Paul signs.
[01:10:07.438 --> 01:10:08.779]  I know mainline Democrats.
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.662]  I know Ron Paul isn't endorsing this either.
[01:10:12.002 --> 01:10:15.285]  Ron Paul Revolution stencils are spray-painted all over everything.
[01:10:15.325 --> 01:10:18.868]  Not people's property, but roads and government signs and things.
[01:10:18.888 --> 01:10:22.251]  There's Ron Paul signs popping up everywhere.
[01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:29.338]  I know that he's got three or four times the MySpace friends that other people have.
[01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:31.441]  Can you speak to the real grassroots?
[01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:32.762]  Because I'm experiencing it.
[01:10:33.423 --> 01:10:35.986]  Frankly, I'm being hounded by the Ron Paul people that I need to do more.
[01:10:36.006 --> 01:10:36.806]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:10:36.826 --> 01:10:38.028]  They're like piranhas.
[01:10:38.548 --> 01:10:39.708]  And which is good.
[01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.309]  This is a revolution.
[01:10:41.749 --> 01:10:47.311]  I'm seeing sparkle-eyed, crazed behavior out of family over Ron Paul.
[01:10:47.991 --> 01:10:51.552]  And I've never seen anything like it because everything is coming to a head right now.
[01:10:51.592 --> 01:10:54.734]  It's a perfect time to have this Founding Father material.
[01:10:55.234 --> 01:10:56.834]  This is epic what's happening.
[01:10:57.134 --> 01:10:58.195]  You get what I'm saying, Kent.
[01:10:58.235 --> 01:10:58.995]  Where is this going?
[01:10:59.475 --> 01:11:02.919]  Well Alex, I tell you what, almost every day I go through the same process.
[01:11:02.999 --> 01:11:12.410]  So when I get up early in the morning, and of course I scan the news, and by listening and reading the news reports, I have basically, there's one story.
[01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:15.693]  You know, the Ron Paul campaign is very minimal.
[01:11:15.933 --> 01:11:17.115]  We know what the storyline is.
[01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:27.162]  And then I come to the office and there are emails and telephone calls from people and then all of a sudden I realize, hey, this is different than what the news media.
[01:11:27.523 --> 01:11:28.945]  I go through this every single day.
[01:11:29.005 --> 01:11:30.207]  People here and the staff do.
[01:11:30.267 --> 01:11:31.970]  It's like we live in two different worlds.
[01:11:32.886 --> 01:11:35.089]  I know what the reality is.
[01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:36.530]  It is as you've described.
[01:11:36.891 --> 01:11:43.017]  My sister calls from Kansas City and says, you know, I was just down one particular street and I saw a Rock Paul sign.
[01:11:43.377 --> 01:11:46.160]  A friend of mine called from all over the country and said the same thing.
[01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:50.745]  A friend of mine in New York was going down an elevator at the Time Warner building and
[01:11:51.105 --> 01:11:54.306]  I overheard two people in the elevator talking about Ron Paul.
[01:11:54.346 --> 01:11:56.447]  He didn't say a word, but just listen to their conversation.
[01:11:56.467 --> 01:11:57.487]  Well, the proof's in the pudding.
[01:11:57.547 --> 01:11:59.268]  It's the number one search term now.
[01:11:59.388 --> 01:12:02.709]  It has finally replaced Paris Hilton and Lacey Peterson.
[01:12:02.969 --> 01:12:04.149]  Right, right.
[01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:06.610]  So we know what's going on.
[01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:13.952]  It's obviously a grassroots campaign, and people are just doing things on their own initiative, which is just absolutely amazing.
[01:12:14.412 --> 01:12:20.494]  But, you know, again, as you said, the mainstream media are trying to ignore it, they're trying to squelch it.
[01:12:25.857 --> 01:12:37.363]  Well, there is no stopping it, and bottom line, Ron Paul, and I encouraged him years ago to run for president and then governor, and I know everybody else encouraged him to do it, and I know it's been thousands of times when he thought it would be, he thought it would just be a way to inject
[01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:43.396]  Uh... you know, real issues into the debate with both parties and really show them as one congealed mass.
[01:12:43.436 --> 01:12:47.560]  But we've got lightning in a bottle because it is the right person at the right place at the right time.
[01:12:48.081 --> 01:12:48.902]  That perfect storm.
[01:12:49.002 --> 01:12:52.185]  Everybody's calling these things security, security, security.
[01:12:52.205 --> 01:12:54.168]  A few months ago we had the Congressman on for a full hour.
[01:12:55.088 --> 01:13:01.253]  He brought it up and said, yeah, I mean, we've seen what's happened to many others, Kennedy, and he said he didn't agree with them, but McGovern and others.
[01:13:03.155 --> 01:13:08.879]  I don't want to get into details on this, obviously, but are you guys, I hope, spending some of that war chest on really serious security?
[01:13:09.099 --> 01:13:11.481]  Because I see video of him out there on the street and it doesn't look like it.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.162]  Yeah, we're getting into that.
[01:13:15.303 --> 01:13:26.853]  We have some people that are now traveling with him and we've been in the works with this for the last several weeks and so we're very mindful of it as a top concern of everybody at the campaign.
[01:13:27.694 --> 01:13:28.975]  So the answer to your question is yes.
[01:13:29.582 --> 01:13:37.790]  Now, you guys are smart, smarter than I am in many respects, so I don't want to sit here and tell your own business, Ken, but I wouldn't take any security firms that come to you.
[01:13:38.311 --> 01:13:45.238]  I would go out and pick them, you know, randomly almost, because you don't want to get in and that's where they'll come at you is from inside.
[01:13:45.638 --> 01:13:53.586]  Yes, now, we understand the world we live in and all that sort of thing, so I'll just say we're very mindful of that.
[01:13:54.478 --> 01:13:58.300]  Well, that's good, because the audience is beating the daylights out of me over it.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.240]  You need to call them.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.141]  You need to... I'm like, they're big boys.
[01:14:01.161 --> 01:14:01.921]  They're big girls.
[01:14:02.201 --> 01:14:04.702]  They didn't just fall off a turnip truck last week.
[01:14:04.762 --> 01:14:07.123]  It was a few years ago, like all of us did.
[01:14:09.284 --> 01:14:09.965]  RonPaul2008.com.
[01:14:10.005 --> 01:14:10.345]  RonPaul2008.com.
[01:14:10.365 --> 01:14:10.385]  1-800.
[01:14:10.425 --> 01:14:11.485]  Give out that 1-800 number.
[01:14:16.367 --> 01:14:25.556]  1-800-RON-PAUL, or the best thing to do again, like you said, go to the website ronpaul2008.com and encourage people to get to Iowa.
[01:14:26.177 --> 01:14:27.518]  How big a donation can people give?
[01:14:27.538 --> 01:14:27.518]  $5.
[01:14:27.558 --> 01:14:31.181]  $5 on a credit card is fine, or maximum is $2,300 per person.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:38.963]  Yeah, but you guys are just asking for the smallest donations.
[01:14:39.163 --> 01:14:42.105]  We ask for it and we appreciate whatever donations people can make.
[01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:42.845]  We honestly do.
[01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:44.406]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:14:44.506 --> 01:14:46.007]  I don't ever have political candidates up.
[01:14:46.067 --> 01:14:47.048]  I mean, very rarely.
[01:14:47.088 --> 01:14:51.050]  I don't have a local candidate up who's fighting ID cards or illegal aliens or something like that.
[01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:53.131]  But, I mean, folks, I've given money.
[01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:53.952]  My dad's given money.
[01:14:55.291 --> 01:15:03.154]  And you need to give money, and this is some of the best spent money you can ever put into something, and you're insane if you don't.
[01:15:03.274 --> 01:15:04.134]  I mean, it's just true.
[01:15:04.174 --> 01:15:07.756]  You're insane if you don't call up and donate to this campaign.
[01:15:07.876 --> 01:15:09.476]  And if you've got $10, if you've got $2,300, let's say you're wealthy.
[01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:18.535]  And your dollars being devalued anyways, Ron Paul's fighting against that, you and your wife, or you and your husband should give.
[01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:21.898]  And then that would be, what, $4,600 between a husband and a wife?
[01:15:22.279 --> 01:15:22.839]  Yes, correct.
[01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:33.189]  And I will say, to give you some good news, I won't give the number, but two days ago, in a 24-hour period, we had the largest online donation in a 24-hour period.
[01:15:33.209 --> 01:15:35.732]  So we set a record for the campaign two days ago.
[01:15:36.232 --> 01:15:37.554]  And I'm thrilled to report that.
[01:15:38.276 --> 01:15:42.823]  So people are doing it and we can continue to break records.
[01:15:42.863 --> 01:15:45.908]  But the good news is we did break an online donation record two days ago.
[01:15:50.404 --> 01:15:55.985]  Well, you know, I think people are beginning to wake up, and the more, you know, the countries are big, and we've got to get out there, we've got a lot more work to do.
[01:16:17.129 --> 01:16:20.212]  It's just really amazing, Alex, the more that I travel with Dr. Paul.
[01:16:20.232 --> 01:16:21.693]  We go from different parts of the country.
[01:16:21.713 --> 01:16:26.317]  I get so many people that say, I've never heard of this guy.
[01:16:26.758 --> 01:16:30.141]  I mean, you and I and your listeners, obviously, we've followed Dr. Paul for years.
[01:16:30.501 --> 01:16:35.045]  But what we have to do is we have to step out of our box and remember and realize
[01:16:35.737 --> 01:16:42.084]  And this is the exciting part, that there are so many people that are coming to the campaign that literally have never heard of Ron Paul.
[01:16:42.124 --> 01:16:46.028]  Now that's hard for us to believe because we've followed him and have supported him for years.
[01:16:46.489 --> 01:16:48.030]  But the country's a big place.
[01:16:48.051 --> 01:16:49.072]  There's what, 300 million people?
[01:16:49.092 --> 01:16:50.033]  It's a big place.
[01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:53.833]  But time and time again, I get that every single day.
[01:16:54.094 --> 01:16:55.195]  I've never heard of this guy.
[01:16:55.295 --> 01:16:56.195]  I like what he's saying.
[01:16:56.215 --> 01:16:57.296]  I like his personality.
[01:16:57.316 --> 01:16:58.297]  I like his background.
[01:16:58.697 --> 01:16:59.798]  I like what he stands for.
[01:17:00.238 --> 01:17:01.159]  He seems reasonable.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.280]  I agree with him.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.101]  Well, let's face it.
[01:17:03.141 --> 01:17:04.302]  There are two different worlds.
[01:17:04.742 --> 01:17:10.847]  There are the general dumbed-down public that just get their news from Fox and CNN, who don't know the difference between a Shiite and a Sunni.
[01:17:10.887 --> 01:17:12.888]  They don't know what a currency devaluation is.
[01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:17.592]  And then you do have, frankly, black, white, old, young, you know, the informed.
[01:17:17.632 --> 01:17:19.794]  And that's why with the intelligentsia, with
[01:17:20.134 --> 01:17:20.354]  Absolutely.
[01:17:20.374 --> 01:17:22.715]  He's got the people who are thinkers.
[01:17:22.875 --> 01:17:24.096]  They are honest.
[01:17:40.342 --> 01:17:52.235]  They understand history, they understand economics, they understand the Constitution, they are pro-family, they understand the importance of family, they understand the importance of freedom.
[01:17:52.315 --> 01:17:54.357]  So I would say that's the grain of the crop.
[01:17:55.385 --> 01:17:59.126]  Well, he's a major lightning rod, whatever you want to call it, for the movement.
[01:17:59.146 --> 01:18:04.368]  And we're praying for you, Ken Schneider, not just Congressman Ron Paul, but the entire staff.
[01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:08.549]  And we just pray that Divine Providence, just like with the Founding Fathers, be involved here.
[01:18:08.589 --> 01:18:10.690]  And all the arrows they shoot at him are bouncing right off.
[01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:14.071]  In the last 30 seconds we've got left, you know, this made-up thing about shrimp.
[01:18:15.372 --> 01:18:19.116]  And of course, as Ron Paul said, that money's allotted.
[01:18:19.136 --> 01:18:20.818]  It'll go to bureaucrats if he doesn't spend it.
[01:18:20.958 --> 01:18:25.784]  Notice, it's for free market restocking the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:18:26.505 --> 01:18:27.066]  Right, right.
[01:18:27.126 --> 01:18:33.771]  Well, you know, Dr. Paul's about freedom and making sure that people keep their tax dollars and all that sort of thing, so his record is pretty clear.
[01:18:34.391 --> 01:18:38.034]  It is, and that's my point, is this stuff's just gonna bounce right off.
[01:18:38.354 --> 01:18:41.596]  RonPaul2008.com, Kent Schneider, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:42.497]  Thanks a bunch, thank you.
[01:18:42.757 --> 01:18:43.098]  You bet.
[01:18:43.438 --> 01:18:48.321]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side with more ear calls and a lot more.
[01:18:48.342 --> 01:18:48.842]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:56.282]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:18:56.802 --> 01:18:58.283]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:18:58.624 --> 01:19:02.467]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:19:02.907 --> 01:19:05.089]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:19:05.529 --> 01:19:08.852]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:19:09.272 --> 01:19:11.734]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:19:12.234 --> 01:19:13.275]  What's that name again?
[01:19:13.675 --> 01:19:14.836]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:19:15.237 --> 01:19:16.397]  It's CalX.
[01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.659]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:19:18.999 --> 01:19:20.841]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:19:21.627 --> 01:19:30.250]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:19:30.670 --> 01:19:36.393]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:19:36.773 --> 01:19:47.897]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, HEB grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:19:48.556 --> 01:19:49.657]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[01:19:49.997 --> 01:19:50.678]  I'll be right back.
[01:19:50.798 --> 01:19:52.540]  I'm getting some callous for my heels.
[01:19:55.303 --> 01:19:56.464]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:56.884 --> 01:20:02.349]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:03.430]  That's right.
[01:20:03.751 --> 01:20:06.413]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:07.434 --> 01:20:13.520]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:14.071 --> 01:20:21.758]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.198 --> 01:20:27.003]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.703]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.484 --> 01:20:37.626]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:38.007 --> 01:20:38.247]  Call 800-686-2237.

[01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:41.149]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:21:50.304 --> 01:21:51.785]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:53.367 --> 01:22:01.855]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume, the water we drink, and the OTCs and prescription medications we take?
[01:22:02.136 --> 01:22:08.322]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[01:22:08.602 --> 01:22:16.285]  The fact is, the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body, from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.
[01:22:16.546 --> 01:22:26.790]  So why not give your liver the help it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula, prescribed by more than 200,000 doctors in over 76 countries.

[01:23:01.181 --> 01:23:22.741]  Your own personal Jesus Someone to hear your prayers Someone who cares Welcome back!
[01:23:23.996 --> 01:23:26.137]  We had him on just a few days ago.
[01:23:26.197 --> 01:23:27.098]  We ran out of time.
[01:23:27.158 --> 01:23:30.480]  There's another guest that's coming on with Dr. Roberts.
[01:23:30.981 --> 01:23:32.542]  He's going to be joining us to talk about the economy.
[01:23:32.562 --> 01:23:33.302]  Perfect timing.
[01:23:33.322 --> 01:23:35.844]  Then we've got Lou Brudowski in the last 30 minutes.
[01:23:35.884 --> 01:23:38.505]  I'm going to try to go to some of your phone calls right now if I want to do that.
[01:23:39.146 --> 01:23:42.928]  Then I'm going to get back into this neocon saying, yeah, I hope we have another 9-11.
[01:23:42.968 --> 01:23:43.989]  It's good for America.
[01:23:44.702 --> 01:23:50.788]  We're going to get into that also with what's happening with the economy, Chaney wanting to go into Iran, openly saying it.
[01:23:51.308 --> 01:23:54.411]  Omar in Toronto, then Rob, Alex, Steve and others.
[01:23:54.451 --> 01:23:55.412]  You're on the air, Omar.
[01:23:55.432 --> 01:23:56.253]  Hi, Alex.
[01:23:56.273 --> 01:24:04.260]  This is a report, I guess, here on the economy in Toronto, which is really the industrial, commercial heartland of Canada.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.140]  I've had about a 30 to 40 percent drop in my business.
[01:24:09.361 --> 01:24:10.601]  I've talked to a lot of other people.
[01:24:10.621 --> 01:24:11.241]  They're all slow.
[01:24:11.261 --> 01:24:12.001]  They're laying off.
[01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:18.862]  We've got streets up here, industrial areas, where literally every other building says, for sale, for lease, for sale, for lease.
[01:24:20.322 --> 01:24:29.024]  And similar sort of stuff you see on signposts, you know, desperation sort of for debt relief, really a lot of bad indicators.
[01:24:29.824 --> 01:24:35.705]  And I think this economy really is starting to do a downturn, especially here.
[01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:40.366]  I think it was a few weeks ago.
[01:24:40.386 --> 01:24:47.629]  The head of the Bank of Canada was in Chicago at a luncheon calling to merge both our currencies.
[01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:53.151]  So there seems to be a lot of bad indicators out there.
[01:24:54.151 --> 01:24:56.832]  That's right, and that was in the news when he did that.
[01:24:56.852 --> 01:25:00.274]  I forget which publication, but I remember covering that.
[01:25:02.034 --> 01:25:04.155]  And at the same time, they say it doesn't exist.
[01:25:04.215 --> 01:25:07.216]  I mean, it's on MSNBC, it's on television, they're proposing this.
[01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:08.576]  Where did I read that?
[01:25:08.677 --> 01:25:14.699]  I saw it on TV, but also, what newspaper was that in?
[01:25:16.639 --> 01:25:18.680]  I tried to search it on the net, I couldn't find it again.
[01:25:19.661 --> 01:25:22.762]  I remember that, and they've also said a bunch on TV the last couple months.
[01:25:23.342 --> 01:25:28.924]  But yeah, they just announced, oh, we need to merge the currencies, and then you say, well, I'm not for that, and they go, we never said that, it doesn't exist.
[01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:45.814]  It was right in the paper, and I called my local MP here about this meeting coming up in Quebec, and he was pretty much on my side, but of course, I said to him, Bob, surely you don't think, because we were talking about the security perimeter, I said, our parliamentarians aren't, because you said, it's all security for Bush.
[01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:50.056]  I said, you're not saying our parliamentarians are a threat to Bush's security.
[01:25:50.957 --> 01:25:58.601]  We've got the police and the foreign power telling our parliamentarians basically where they can meet, where they can't meet.
[01:26:00.393 --> 01:26:03.355]  I guess they can pretty much do anything they want.
[01:26:03.395 --> 01:26:04.556]  I mean, it's right out in the open.
[01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:06.657]  The emperor lands his troops at this gorge.
[01:26:06.717 --> 01:26:19.244]  I remember a BBC article about Bush landing, I'm forgetting which African nation, and they had literally arrested everyone on the main road from the airport out of all their shacks and just bulldozed it so he wouldn't even have to look at them.
[01:26:19.705 --> 01:26:20.845]  I mean, you talk about emperors.
[01:26:21.166 --> 01:26:25.728]  Bulldozing whole neighborhoods just so the emperor won't have to see it.
[01:26:25.768 --> 01:26:28.350]  I mean, that is arrogant evil, my friend.
[01:26:29.411 --> 01:26:30.192]  Pretty disgusting.
[01:26:30.712 --> 01:26:32.273]  Well, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
[01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:34.475]  I'm kind of anxious as a Canadian.
[01:26:34.535 --> 01:26:36.177]  I'm sitting on the sidelines here.
[01:26:36.297 --> 01:26:38.659]  I'm doing what I can to make people aware.
[01:26:38.719 --> 01:26:44.504]  I've got extended family in Indiana, friends with people in Texas and so on.
[01:26:44.544 --> 01:26:50.229]  I'm trying to make them aware of Ron Paul and what he stands for.
[01:26:50.309 --> 01:26:54.233]  It really is pretty large what he's doing because it's almost the equivalent of
[01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:58.516]  I just wanted to comment on a few things regarding the economy.
[01:26:58.596 --> 01:27:01.058]  I was just appalled when Jim Cramer got on his soapbox.
[01:27:21.221 --> 01:27:25.625]  And was crying about all his cronies on Wall Street that are losing their jobs.
[01:27:26.807 --> 01:27:36.076]  And then he was crying about the $14 million teaser loans, $7 million of which could default.
[01:27:36.756 --> 01:27:40.700]  Well, hey, they all loved the offshoring of our industry.
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:41.381]  They loved that part.
[01:27:42.037 --> 01:27:54.404]  Well, the onshoring of the drug trade, the Afghani opium trade, which is another record crop this year that they're going to launder through Wall Street, through Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke.
[01:27:54.424 --> 01:27:56.786]  It's just amazing to me.
[01:27:58.307 --> 01:28:08.373]  Going back last year, Alex, with President Bush appointing the former czar, John Negroponte, to allow the SEC
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:15.545]  Do not file any reports as to their financial dealings on Wall Street.
[01:28:15.605 --> 01:28:22.572]  I mean, where were the regulators when all these banks were lending out no-doc loans to immigrants?
[01:28:22.592 --> 01:28:24.673]  I mean, they just looked the other way.
[01:28:24.734 --> 01:28:27.656]  They created this mess.
[01:28:27.696 --> 01:28:29.178]  Now, this caller knows what he's talking about.
[01:28:29.218 --> 01:28:29.858]  Stay there, sir.
[01:28:30.459 --> 01:28:30.979]  Stay there, Rob.
[01:28:31.019 --> 01:28:32.701]  I'm going to give you the forum and get back.
[01:28:33.488 --> 01:28:34.449]  Absolutely, folks.
[01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:39.714]  Millions of illegal aliens in the last two years were given loans with no documentation.
[01:28:39.734 --> 01:28:40.655]  That was in the AP.
[01:28:40.895 --> 01:28:42.937]  The bank said, because you're so special.
[01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:45.019]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.499 --> 01:28:47.100]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.021 --> 01:28:50.704]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.483 --> 01:28:56.726]  Oh, those summer nights and those summer electric bills.
[01:28:56.926 --> 01:29:00.250]  How would you like to save money this summer on your electric bill and sleep better than ever?
[01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:03.073]  Well, now you can with the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:29:03.193 --> 01:29:06.777]  The BedFan will allow you to raise your thermostat several degrees and still sleep cool.
[01:29:07.037 --> 01:29:11.622]  This works by delivering a gentle breeze between your sheets, thus keeping your body cool and comfortable.
[01:29:11.922 --> 01:29:13.244]  Doug from Austin, Texas writes,
[01:29:13.624 --> 01:29:15.365]  I like it to be very cold while sleeping.
[01:29:15.445 --> 01:29:21.407]  Since purchasing the BedFan I've been able to turn the thermostat up from 68 to 78 degrees and I've never been more comfortable.
[01:29:21.587 --> 01:29:25.529]  My electric bill this month compared to the same month last year is over 27% lower.
[01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:27.170]  I couldn't be happier with your product.
[01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:30.711]  Maybe it is time you started thinking about trying the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:29:30.931 --> 01:29:32.311]  If you're a hot sleeper, you will love it.
[01:29:32.451 --> 01:29:34.632]  If you want to lower your electric bill, you will love it too.
[01:29:34.812 --> 01:29:37.793]  Go to BedFan.com and try the remarkable BedFan yourself.
[01:29:37.933 --> 01:29:40.013]  That's BedFan.com or call 210-632-8280.
[01:29:40.173 --> 01:29:40.433]  That's 210-632-8280.
[01:29:40.453 --> 01:29:42.654]  The BedFan is on sale for a limited time, so don't delay.
[01:29:42.674 --> 01:29:43.534]  Remember, BedFan.com or 210-632-8280.
[01:29:43.634 --> 01:29:46.655]  Each night when you sleep, your body uses the time to restore itself.
[01:29:59.591 --> 01:30:01.332]  So that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[01:30:01.852 --> 01:30:04.234]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?

[01:30:54.301 --> 01:30:56.823]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:57.183 --> 01:31:01.666]  Did you know that Russia sponsored a terrorist training camp in Havana, Cuba in 1966?
[01:31:02.246 --> 01:31:07.910]  In this camp, they planned terrorist activity on every continent, including the United States.
[01:31:08.570 --> 01:31:12.433]  Have we seen terrorist activities on every continent just as they planned?

[01:32:09.493 --> 01:32:12.235]  It's going down.
[01:32:12.255 --> 01:32:15.219]  It's going down now.
[01:32:15.639 --> 01:32:17.401]  Down to Chicago!
[01:32:22.706 --> 01:32:23.287]  Welcome back.
[01:32:32.253 --> 01:32:36.096]  We're about to go back to Rob and Alex and Steve and Tim.
[01:32:38.778 --> 01:32:39.238]  Many others.
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:42.001]  Yep.
[01:32:42.681 --> 01:32:43.982]  Crying won't help you.
[01:32:44.062 --> 01:32:45.063]  Praying won't do.
[01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:45.944]  You're no good.
[01:32:45.964 --> 01:32:47.145]  That's for the New World Order.
[01:32:47.925 --> 01:32:55.451]  Because their hearts are as black as the pits of hell and they've been completely turned over to their wicked ways to the point that they're not even human anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:55.891 --> 01:32:57.032]  And they don't see us as human either.
[01:32:57.052 --> 01:33:00.275]  That's why they feed on us with wanton abandon and extreme pleasure.
[01:33:00.555 --> 01:33:01.896]  We're about to go back to your calls, but
[01:33:03.738 --> 01:33:08.560]  There were half a dozen, there weren't that many, but half a dozen that I saw.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.241]  One was AP.
[01:33:11.501 --> 01:33:13.782]  It was about eight, nine months ago.
[01:33:13.802 --> 01:33:15.243]  I remember I made a big deal about it on air.
[01:33:15.263 --> 01:33:16.623]  I read it over and over again on air.
[01:33:17.604 --> 01:33:20.445]  My first heard Jack McClam here on Genesis one night reading it in whole.
[01:33:21.025 --> 01:33:22.966]  I almost ran off the road and I went home and pulled it up.
[01:33:23.006 --> 01:33:28.668]  I already knew it was happening, but to see it, and it was something like, banks help immigrants with home loans.
[01:33:29.248 --> 01:33:33.190]  And then it had like the head of the US Banking Association in there and it said,
[01:33:33.911 --> 01:33:37.314]  Another headline was, 800 lenders help immigrants.
[01:33:38.374 --> 01:33:39.535]  That's almost exact headlines.
[01:33:39.555 --> 01:33:40.756]  If you Google that, it should come up.
[01:33:41.717 --> 01:33:42.337]  Maybe exact.
[01:33:42.357 --> 01:33:48.462]  I mean, they said in there, I'm paraphrasing, but this is almost word for word from memory.
[01:33:49.463 --> 01:33:55.007]  Well, there's a lot of mean people who are trying to keep them from having the American way, and they just want to work hard and love this country.
[01:33:55.627 --> 01:33:57.128]  They're so vital to this country.
[01:33:57.148 --> 01:33:59.590]  We're going to give them loans, housing loans.
[01:34:00.450 --> 01:34:04.331]  And it went on to say, without social security cards, or without any ID.
[01:34:05.091 --> 01:34:12.973]  And then later it was in USA Today about it, and the bank accounts, and it was all over the news, months after it was finally in the print, then it was on Lou Dobbs and the rest of it.
[01:34:13.654 --> 01:34:18.935]  And again folks, I don't personally dislike the third world population, but there's billions of them folks,
[01:34:19.821 --> 01:34:31.570]  And all they do is drive down wages and make the turn to a third world country, and then they give them loans, and they've got federal numbers that the average illegal alien gets triple in welfare and government services, what they pay in tax.
[01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:34.051]  And folks, they're not just here to pick strawberries.
[01:34:34.552 --> 01:34:37.194]  They're here to take over the main industries, and they've done it.
[01:34:37.894 --> 01:34:39.415]  And to bring us into third world serfdom.
[01:34:39.455 --> 01:34:40.776]  It doesn't end up helping Mexico.
[01:34:41.297 --> 01:34:48.762]  And on top of it, their government is encouraged to make them nationalistic, and we've had two wars with these people, and they're taught it in school, and they do not like us, folks.
[01:34:49.474 --> 01:34:52.475]  I mean, after 9-11, they cheered and said, Usama, Usama.
[01:34:53.036 --> 01:34:56.917]  I mean, just a few weeks after, it was all over the news in Mexico City.
[01:34:57.678 --> 01:35:02.720]  I mean, believing that 9-11 was a real attack from Al-Qaeda, and they like it.
[01:35:04.321 --> 01:35:09.963]  Now, folks, I'm just tired of the media acting like they're a bunch of sweetie pies that just want to kiss us and love on us.
[01:35:12.344 --> 01:35:15.025]  My wife speaks Spanish, and believe me, folks, they're not saying that.
[01:35:16.026 --> 01:35:19.027]  And I'm not saying all the illegal aliens, but I'd say about half of them.
[01:35:20.703 --> 01:35:23.825]  And, you know, I'm already digressing here.
[01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:26.447]  It's just that, yes, they're getting a lot of these loans.
[01:35:28.248 --> 01:35:30.249]  By the way, those loans to illegal aliens aren't stopping.
[01:35:30.689 --> 01:35:31.530]  None of it's going to stop.
[01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:34.171]  It's not going to stop.
[01:35:34.211 --> 01:35:38.894]  I mean, whatever red carpet has to be rolled out to the third world to bring this country down, they're doing it.
[01:35:40.015 --> 01:35:45.578]  Before we go back to Rob that I really want to hear from, I'm getting to the point where I'm covering so much news, I'm not even plugging my videos anymore.
[01:35:46.119 --> 01:35:49.641]  And that's not a good thing, because these are really the best tool we've got in the info war.
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:53.861]  And your purchase of these films funds what we do here.
[01:35:54.781 --> 01:35:56.901]  Terror Storm Special Edition, the final cut.
[01:35:57.862 --> 01:35:58.802]  17 minutes of added footage.
[01:35:59.062 --> 01:36:02.323]  3 hours and 20 plus minutes on the DVD.
[01:36:02.503 --> 01:36:06.243]  Over a 2 hour film with over an hour and 7 minutes of extras.
[01:36:06.704 --> 01:36:10.784]  The 9-11 Neoconagentist Symposium with all the experts on 9-11 doing an inside job.
[01:36:10.804 --> 01:36:11.605]  That's just the extra.
[01:36:11.845 --> 01:36:13.105]  And that's a film in and of itself.
[01:36:13.712 --> 01:36:14.992]  The highlights of that two-day conference.
[01:36:15.213 --> 01:36:19.454]  But the film is a masterpiece that I put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into.
[01:36:20.114 --> 01:36:26.076]  And I hope you'll get Terror Storm, because we put all this energy into making these films that don't even really promote them.
[01:36:26.136 --> 01:36:27.057]  It's up to you to do that.
[01:36:27.117 --> 01:36:28.097]  Please get the DVD.
[01:36:28.157 --> 01:36:29.778]  Please make high-quality digital copies.
[01:36:29.818 --> 01:36:34.199]  Burn copies until your heart's desire, and then some, of Terror Storm.
[01:36:34.239 --> 01:36:34.899]  Please get it from us.
[01:36:35.199 --> 01:36:36.660]  Also, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.340]  You know, we actually bought these at full price.
[01:36:41.675 --> 01:36:45.457]  At 50%, that's full retail for bulk sales from Aaron to actually support him.
[01:36:46.297 --> 01:36:50.799]  There's hundreds of sites that sell knock-offs and burn copies and say lobby, whatever.
[01:36:51.219 --> 01:36:52.900]  It's just that we actually bought these from Aaron.
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:58.202]  And it's the original from Aaron Russo.
[01:36:59.482 --> 01:37:02.884]  And you can get them at Infowars.com right now and get it for $9.95.
[01:37:03.024 --> 01:37:05.685]  By the way, I bought them for $9 apiece.
[01:37:10.123 --> 01:37:10.943]  Call me a schmuck.
[01:37:10.963 --> 01:37:12.764]  Everybody else just gets them and burns them and sells them.
[01:37:15.184 --> 01:37:19.725]  But, um, I just hope that you will get America Freedom to Fascism from us.
[01:37:19.985 --> 01:37:21.906]  When you get it with Terror Storm, you can get it as low as $9.95.
[01:37:22.306 --> 01:37:24.766]  The Police State Trilogy is $34.95.
[01:37:24.806 --> 01:37:28.067]  That's 45% off my three Police State films.
[01:37:28.567 --> 01:37:33.028]  Three different DVDs in one case.
[01:37:33.928 --> 01:37:36.309]  And, look, I'm done plugging in InfoWars.com or 888.
[01:37:38.643 --> 01:37:38.703]  253-3139.
[01:37:38.723 --> 01:37:39.384]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:37:39.404 --> 01:37:40.645]  Or you can write to me.
[01:37:40.665 --> 01:37:43.668]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704 or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:43.708 --> 01:37:44.889]  15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[01:37:44.969 --> 01:37:47.872]  The cost of two and a half cups of Starbucks coffee.
[01:38:00.064 --> 01:38:06.948]  That allows us to have the better servers and to have the webmasters and make the videos and put them up there for you in really high quality.
[01:38:06.968 --> 01:38:08.609]  You can just burn them to disk all day long.
[01:38:09.029 --> 01:38:18.635]  My book, Paul Watson's book, hundreds of my TV shows, hundreds of in-studio interviews, all my best audio interviews, thousands of pieces of media, three-plus years up and running, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:18.675 --> 01:38:20.336]  And if you have a membership, I want to thank you for the support.
[01:38:20.356 --> 01:38:22.037]  If you haven't gotten one, get one today.
[01:38:22.497 --> 01:38:24.258]  Okay, let's go back to Rob.
[01:38:24.278 --> 01:38:25.639]  I appreciate you holding through that babble.
[01:38:26.239 --> 01:38:27.640]  Rob, you're making points about the economy.
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:27.940]  Go ahead.
[01:38:29.184 --> 01:38:31.686]  Yeah, Alex, just a comment on your body of work, too.
[01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:43.973]  It's just amazing to see your earlier work and how, in your infancy, you were really naive as to what's going on in comparison to now.
[01:38:45.074 --> 01:38:58.142]  Through the progressive nature of your work and the accumulation of research, you've really... For me, personally, it's good to be at this point in your career where you're really hitting on all cylinders.
[01:38:59.011 --> 01:39:18.045]  But anyway, getting back to the Jim Cramer incident, it's just amazing to me that these guys on Wall Street can stand on their bully pulpit and actually beg and plead Helicopter Ben to open the credit window.
[01:39:18.145 --> 01:39:22.928]  It was just such hubris to see how connected these guys really are.
[01:39:23.469 --> 01:39:27.772]  And most of these guys have made their billions of dollars and taken it offshore.
[01:39:28.581 --> 01:39:44.736]  They've taken it to Euros and Swiss Francs and Yen, and they're getting ready to really pull the plug on the whole deal, because there's hundreds of trillions of dollars in derivatives and collateralized debt obligation and other scams.
[01:39:46.357 --> 01:39:54.164]  There's no hard assets backing these leveraged deals, and that's why we're having these runs on these banks in Europe.
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:40:06.409]  When businesses go to borrow money and there's no money there, the Bank of France closed their bank and there's no money on those lines of credit to borrow against.
[01:40:06.429 --> 01:40:08.771]  The banks don't have the money.
[01:40:08.911 --> 01:40:11.353]  That's why the Fed had to come in today.
[01:40:12.467 --> 01:40:17.814]  And the European Central Banks had to come in today and provide billions of dollars.
[01:40:27.827 --> 01:40:49.919]  You know, for those guys out there, why don't you explain to them in layman's terms that they lended out and leveraged so far, not just not having money, they are in the negative, and so now the central banks are having to inject hundreds of billions of dollars, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, but if you look at it, the Federal Reserve isn't even injecting
[01:40:50.399 --> 01:40:57.505]  A fraction of what would really be needed to stop the plunge is just enough to stop a complete overnight plunge.
[01:40:57.845 --> 01:40:58.526]  Exactly.
[01:40:58.926 --> 01:41:00.968]  It's just a day's supply, Alex.
[01:41:01.148 --> 01:41:02.549]  That's all they injected today.
[01:41:02.729 --> 01:41:11.957]  Europe injected well over $100 billion because they had a bigger crunch because they have more countries involved in that union.
[01:41:12.717 --> 01:41:13.878]  But the U.S.
[01:41:13.898 --> 01:41:17.841]  just gave a modest amount just to stop the bleeding.
[01:41:18.222 --> 01:41:19.783]  And as you mentioned, Friday,
[01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:25.445]  Will stop this hemorrhaging because of the weekend.
[01:41:26.766 --> 01:41:33.371]  You're right, if this happened on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, this could be a prolonged decline.
[01:41:33.632 --> 01:41:34.352]  Cascade.
[01:41:35.153 --> 01:41:36.314]  Yeah, it could be.
[01:41:36.614 --> 01:41:42.038]  You know, it's like the driver sitting on the bridge in Minneapolis and seeing the bridge not there anymore.
[01:41:43.299 --> 01:41:47.903]  You can imagine the fear in their hearts and minds.
[01:41:48.867 --> 01:41:51.109]  It's not there.
[01:41:51.389 --> 01:41:54.171]  The overpass is falling into the river.
[01:41:54.251 --> 01:41:55.692]  And I think that's symbolic.
[01:41:55.712 --> 01:42:02.157]  I've been noticing bridges falling down really every couple weeks and it's kept real quiet in the last few years.
[01:42:02.197 --> 01:42:03.137]  And that's symbolic.
[01:42:03.157 --> 01:42:06.560]  And even the new one they were building in Arizona collapsed.
[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:09.002]  And it's because it's all become delusional.
[01:42:09.102 --> 01:42:11.103]  They think, hey, we won't really build this to standard.
[01:42:11.364 --> 01:42:12.845]  We won't really build this with quality.
[01:42:13.145 --> 01:42:14.686]  We really won't fix things anymore.
[01:42:15.007 --> 01:42:16.708]  We'll just run around and be delusional.
[01:42:16.808 --> 01:42:20.991]  I mean, it's like we are a delusional pig people.
[01:42:21.472 --> 01:42:22.953]  Myself included, in many respects.
[01:42:23.013 --> 01:42:31.620]  I mean, we really... Look, you know, the Bible says in one passage, I forget where, but, you know, that they're destroyed by plenty, by decadence, and we're falling apart.
[01:42:32.261 --> 01:42:36.364]  Well, the SEC has looked the other way for the last six, seven years.
[01:42:36.983 --> 01:42:45.373]  They have not regularly, the banking industry, since when do you fill out an application and not have to document your income?
[01:42:47.035 --> 01:42:47.356]  When?
[01:42:47.376 --> 01:42:56.287]  I mean, that's just, you're asking for, and then you bundle those mortgages and sell them as collateralized debt obligations.
[01:42:57.114 --> 01:43:02.076]  The banks and the regulators were given carte blanche to do whatever they want.
[01:43:02.136 --> 01:43:06.939]  Negroponte was told by Bush, hey, don't regulate these guys.
[01:43:07.019 --> 01:43:07.959]  Let them do what they want.
[01:43:07.979 --> 01:43:08.879]  But he's good.
[01:43:08.919 --> 01:43:09.920]  He fights Al Qaeda.
[01:43:11.843 --> 01:43:13.324]  These guys are all crooks.
[01:43:13.404 --> 01:43:14.485]  It's just amazing.
[01:43:14.525 --> 01:43:15.606]  We look the other way.
[01:43:16.226 --> 01:43:22.610]  Alex, you and I both know no one was prosecuted in the 9-1-1 investigation for incompetency.
[01:43:23.071 --> 01:43:26.513]  No one was, FEMA, Katrina, no one was prosecuted.
[01:43:26.913 --> 01:43:29.735]  No one is being prosecuted on Wall Street for allowing this.
[01:43:29.775 --> 01:43:36.120]  Taxpayers are going to have to bail this whole thing out, just like the SML, or it's going to go totally south.
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:37.641]  We're going to get the Omero.
[01:43:38.523 --> 01:43:41.644]  Well, the biggest thing I can tell the people out there who love the system
[01:43:59.491 --> 01:44:02.112]  This is, I mean, the Troy from West Virginia.
[01:44:02.152 --> 01:44:03.733]  By the way, folks, he does still work there.
[01:44:03.753 --> 01:44:05.014]  Of course, they lied to us and said he didn't.
[01:44:05.034 --> 01:44:05.674]  We called and checked.
[01:44:05.994 --> 01:44:08.055]  Who calls up threatening and all the rest of the things they do.
[01:44:09.516 --> 01:44:11.136]  He just said the milk and honey is going to go forever.
[01:44:11.176 --> 01:44:12.957]  And I'd say, don't you care about the currency?
[01:44:12.977 --> 01:44:14.718]  He'd be like, screw Ron Paul.
[01:44:14.738 --> 01:44:15.939]  You know, it's all made up.
[01:44:15.979 --> 01:44:17.059]  You guys are all liars.
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:24.203]  The thing is, if things get bad, those types will do whatever the government tells them for the promise of they'll make it all better.
[01:44:24.463 --> 01:44:26.944]  They'll make it go away or they'll tell them Bin Laden did it.
[01:44:27.544 --> 01:44:33.969]  And I just want all that scum out there to know that if you don't grow up now and realize what we're facing, they'll go all the way to the wall with this.
[01:44:34.329 --> 01:44:35.370]  These are ruthless people.
[01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:37.912]  And if they can get away with something, they will do it.
[01:44:38.552 --> 01:44:44.556]  And so now is the time to not trust the government, to realize it's illegitimate, to get the word out and to let the establishment know.
[01:44:44.596 --> 01:44:45.497]  I mean, call the White House.
[01:44:45.857 --> 01:44:46.677]  It is a whole big plan, Alex.
[01:44:46.737 --> 01:44:48.478]  I think this could be the August Surprise.
[01:44:48.498 --> 01:44:50.379]  If this thing unravels, they don't need a dirty bomb.
[01:44:50.399 --> 01:44:52.279]  This could really set the whole wheels in motion.
[01:45:12.409 --> 01:45:13.549]  What do you think the yuppies will do?
[01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:15.790]  They'll run right into the lap of those that did it, right?
[01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:17.291]  Just lick their boots and worship them?
[01:45:18.551 --> 01:45:19.532]  They won't have a choice.
[01:45:20.132 --> 01:45:24.573]  They're so brainwashed to realize that... They'll think it's good.
[01:45:24.593 --> 01:45:25.654]  Like you said, it's good.
[01:45:25.674 --> 01:45:26.934]  It's all good.
[01:45:27.014 --> 01:45:27.554]  Come with us.
[01:45:27.654 --> 01:45:28.135]  It's good.
[01:45:28.775 --> 01:45:28.995]  You know?
[01:45:31.568 --> 01:45:46.700]  You know, but I mean, I've used examples of so-called friends I've had, and as you get older you learn to just cut people off faster and faster, but I used to let people put me through the wringer, do things to me, put up with it, and I've learned, just know, it's best to just put your foot down and not put up with it.
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:56.127]  I mean, you know, the analogy is if I had a neighbor who I let house-sit, and every time they house-sitted, once or twice, and I got robbed while they were house-sitting, I'd figure out they were behind it, or somebody they knew was.
[01:45:56.487 --> 01:46:01.251]  Instead, it's like the government's robbed us a thousand times, lied to us a million times, and these people just love
[01:46:01.511 --> 01:46:02.112]  They just love it!
[01:46:02.132 --> 01:46:02.712]  They just love it!
[01:46:02.732 --> 01:46:04.514]  Alex, the government now employs over 50%.
[01:46:05.374 --> 01:46:06.435]  Their numbers are 50%.
[01:46:06.575 --> 01:46:09.217]  It's a new milestone in history.
[01:46:09.618 --> 01:46:12.200]  50% of GDP is government services.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:22.608]  But don't the cops understand that the system's bankrupt when they're... They're not going to go where they're... Hey, their bread is... They're getting their $35K a year to keep their trailer, you know?
[01:46:22.688 --> 01:46:23.429]  I mean, come on!
[01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:25.411]  They're not going to turn against
[01:46:26.812 --> 01:46:28.753]  You know, paycheck is being signed.
[01:46:29.214 --> 01:46:34.558]  You know, I think a lot of them would actually, I think they'd wind people up if they were told to.
[01:46:34.578 --> 01:46:36.699]  That's what I'm saying there.
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:42.884]  You know how many senior citizens now get checks from the government, the social security?
[01:46:42.904 --> 01:46:46.146]  They're not going to stand up in righteous indignation and say enough.
[01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:49.829]  They're afraid they're not going to get their prescription drugs paid for.
[01:46:50.689 --> 01:46:53.690]  I mean, we're all slaves to the government.
[01:46:53.770 --> 01:46:59.792]  You know, Ron Paul is right with the inflation tax and the Federal Reserve and the IRS.
[01:46:59.872 --> 01:47:02.092]  I mean, Alex, look at it.
[01:47:02.192 --> 01:47:04.453]  There's 32 taxes on a loaf of bread.
[01:47:05.793 --> 01:47:11.635]  From the seed planted in the ground by that machine to the time it gets to the shelves in the grocery store.
[01:47:12.435 --> 01:47:15.776]  We are being sucked dry by our government.
[01:47:16.266 --> 01:47:18.828]  Well, the incredible thing is the new level of lying.
[01:47:18.848 --> 01:47:22.390]  I mean, I said 10 years ago the media would just lie, lie a lot, or spin.
[01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:28.814]  And then they got to where they were being caught in lies in the late 90s, early 2000s.
[01:47:28.834 --> 01:47:34.898]  So they mainly, they were still lying some, but a lot of it was just basic spinning that they would engage in.
[01:47:35.899 --> 01:47:41.503]  And now it's as if the brakes were taken off and they're just lying.
[01:47:41.563 --> 01:47:44.705]  I mean, they'll have a Canada meeting and say it's not even happening.
[01:47:46.923 --> 01:47:48.824]  Alex, everyone feels powerless.
[01:47:49.384 --> 01:47:54.286]  They're so brainwashed by the television that they don't think they can do anything.
[01:47:54.306 --> 01:47:57.367]  They vote and it doesn't count because the machines are rigged.
[01:47:57.927 --> 01:47:59.988]  The whole thing, we're in a matrix.
[01:48:00.748 --> 01:48:01.709]  And we can't get out.
[01:48:02.669 --> 01:48:04.190]  It's that deep.
[01:48:04.690 --> 01:48:05.770]  And you know it as well as I do.
[01:48:06.271 --> 01:48:07.111]  We're powerless.
[01:48:08.371 --> 01:48:14.734]  That's the feeling that most Americans... You know when you're working 60 hours a week, and your wife's working 60 hours a week,
[01:48:22.476 --> 01:48:22.996]  Well, you're right.
[01:48:23.056 --> 01:48:25.857]  I scream and yell about snot-nosed yuppies all day because I see them.
[01:48:25.877 --> 01:48:26.537]  They don't have kids.
[01:48:26.557 --> 01:48:27.697]  They're not married yet.
[01:48:27.717 --> 01:48:29.398]  They're not busting their butt with a mortgage yet.
[01:48:29.418 --> 01:48:31.138]  They're trendy, Wendy-ing around.
[01:48:31.498 --> 01:48:33.459]  But for the general public, they're getting home at 6-7.
[01:48:33.599 --> 01:48:35.659]  They don't even have time to go to the gym anymore.
[01:48:35.979 --> 01:48:37.960]  They cook the MSG food.
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:38.840]  They give it to the kids.
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:40.841]  They're playing the Exterminator video games.
[01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:44.382]  Actually, with Pentagon Design training to be Extermination Squads.
[01:48:44.402 --> 01:48:45.062]  They don't even know it.
[01:48:45.402 --> 01:48:46.142]  I want to be like you, Alex.
[01:48:46.162 --> 01:48:49.825]  I want to sit by a lake on the canoe and fish and enjoy nature and the wonderment of the universe.
[01:49:10.689 --> 01:49:15.215]  What we're in now is just a huge maze of lies and deception.
[01:49:15.255 --> 01:49:19.621]  I mean, the truth is so far gone that people just don't realize it.
[01:49:20.102 --> 01:49:27.312]  And every time the truth gets this far gone, in fact, I don't think it's ever been this far gone, billions suffer, millions die.
[01:49:28.232 --> 01:49:30.294]  And I don't know how to explain this to you folks.
[01:49:30.394 --> 01:49:35.278]  We are in deep, deep, deep, deep crap.
[01:49:35.718 --> 01:49:37.380]  And that's the only word I have to describe it.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:38.601]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[01:49:38.641 --> 01:49:40.002]  You're a great caller, Rob.
[01:49:40.402 --> 01:49:41.023]  I appreciate it.
[01:49:41.123 --> 01:49:42.964]  Alex, Steve, Tim, Steve, others.
[01:49:44.445 --> 01:49:45.346]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:49:45.366 --> 01:49:47.048]  We're going to have Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:49:47.168 --> 01:49:48.949]  Dr. Roberts is scheduled to be on.
[01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:52.072]  Top economist, one of the top economists on the planet.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.464]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.824 --> 01:50:10.449]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.147 --> 01:50:18.211]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:30.017]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.337 --> 01:50:33.839]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.299 --> 01:50:36.260]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:40.402]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.522 --> 01:50:58.623]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.683 --> 01:51:06.006]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:06.146 --> 01:51:16.809]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.969 --> 01:51:21.510]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:26.796]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.997 --> 01:51:29.940]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:39.872]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:51:53.382 --> 01:51:57.424]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:51:57.644 --> 01:52:01.046]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:52:01.226 --> 01:52:04.707]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:52:04.967 --> 01:52:08.229]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:52:08.249 --> 01:52:13.691]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[01:52:13.731 --> 01:52:18.954]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:52:19.394 --> 01:52:20.055]  We're good to go!
[01:52:36.815 --> 01:52:41.197]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll free number again?
[01:52:41.217 --> 01:52:42.538]  1-877-928-8822 Day after day, alone on a hill
[01:53:04.019 --> 01:53:09.649]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[01:53:10.109 --> 01:53:13.295]  But nobody wants to know him.
[01:53:13.716 --> 01:53:16.060]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[01:53:23.531 --> 01:53:26.313]  This is about Bernanke.
[01:53:26.353 --> 01:53:27.354]  This is about Bernanke.
[01:53:27.454 --> 01:53:28.715]  He has to be on that call.
[01:53:28.955 --> 01:53:30.036]  Forget the investors.
[01:53:30.376 --> 01:53:34.499]  The investors are going to do... Bernanke needs to open the discount window.
[01:53:34.539 --> 01:53:36.160]  That's how bad things are out there.
[01:53:36.481 --> 01:53:38.202]  Bernanke needs to focus on this.
[01:53:38.742 --> 01:53:43.607]  Alan Greenspan told everyone to take a teaser rate and then raised the rate 17 times!
[01:53:43.947 --> 01:53:45.929]  And Bernanke is being an academic!
[01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:48.131]  It is no time to be an academic!
[01:53:48.451 --> 01:53:50.393]  It is time to get on the Bear Stearns call!
[01:53:50.813 --> 01:53:51.213]  Listen!
[01:53:51.554 --> 01:53:53.335]  Open the darn Fed window!
[01:53:53.395 --> 01:53:55.577]  He has no idea how bad it is out there!
[01:53:55.597 --> 01:53:56.738]  He has no idea!
[01:53:57.199 --> 01:53:58.440]  He has no idea!
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:53:59.660]  Kramer.
[01:53:59.901 --> 01:54:06.247]  I have talked to the heads of almost every single one of these firms in the last 72 hours, and he has no idea what it's like out there!
[01:54:06.467 --> 01:54:06.927]  None!
[01:54:07.368 --> 01:54:10.751]  And Bill Poole has no idea what it's like out there!
[01:54:11.111 --> 01:54:18.559]  My people have been in this game for 25 years, and they are losing their jobs, and these firms are gonna go out of business, and he's nuts!
[01:54:18.619 --> 01:54:19.279]  They're nuts!
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:20.601]  They know nothing!
[01:54:21.542 --> 01:54:21.822]  Kramer.
[01:54:23.519 --> 01:54:29.468]  I have not seen it like this since I went five bid for half a million shares of Citigroup and I got hit in 1990!
[01:54:29.788 --> 01:54:31.310]  This is a different kind of market!
[01:54:31.591 --> 01:54:33.033]  And the Fed is asleep!
[01:54:33.832 --> 01:54:34.753]  Okay, but here's the thing.
[01:54:34.813 --> 01:54:36.334]  No, Bill Poole is a shame!
[01:54:36.354 --> 01:54:37.455]  He's shameful!
[01:54:37.915 --> 01:54:38.916]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:54:39.096 --> 01:54:41.458]  He doesn't go and read the credit at home document.
[01:54:41.518 --> 01:54:42.820]  At least I read the darn thing.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:50.646]  Hold on, I know you're passionate and I hear you, but at the same time, a lot of people are saying this is, yes, there's certain types of mortgages that aren't available.
[01:54:51.026 --> 01:54:52.468]  There are all sorts of issues.
[01:54:52.488 --> 01:54:54.529]  I can't get a loan that's as rich as me.
[01:54:55.470 --> 01:55:01.532]  Well, Kramer, if you did what you said, which seems to me from the way you just explained yourself... Open the discount window!
[01:55:01.552 --> 01:55:01.713]  Cut it!
[01:55:01.733 --> 01:55:02.333]  Cut the rate!
[01:55:02.393 --> 01:55:03.213]  Open the discount window!
[01:55:03.233 --> 01:55:03.673]  Cut the rate!
[01:55:03.693 --> 01:55:04.294]  We'll leave the pressure!
[01:55:04.394 --> 01:55:06.915]  You're going to have... That's going to cause Armageddon.
[01:55:07.135 --> 01:55:07.915]  No, we have Armageddon.
[01:55:08.255 --> 01:55:09.456]  I wouldn't try to cause it.
[01:55:09.496 --> 01:55:10.196]  We have Armageddon.
[01:55:10.476 --> 01:55:12.317]  In the fixed income markets, we have Armageddon.
[01:55:12.377 --> 01:55:16.198]  Look, all that's happening is Armageddon's being delayed one way or the other.
[01:55:17.479 --> 01:55:24.922]  If they raise the rates, the dollar goes down even further, and then that starts publicly accelerating the incredible 13 per annum percent
[01:55:25.996 --> 01:55:30.400]  Yearly, that we're already facing with the inflation.
[01:55:31.061 --> 01:55:32.182]  And then it starts compounding.
[01:55:33.483 --> 01:55:41.530]  And if you go the other direction, then it allows these guys to continue to pump up the stock and fool everybody and then reposition themselves.
[01:55:42.031 --> 01:55:43.832]  I mean, it's not hard to figure out, folks.
[01:55:43.892 --> 01:55:46.595]  We've got an economist coming on about that here in just a few minutes.
[01:55:47.415 --> 01:55:49.938]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in New York.
[01:55:49.978 --> 01:55:50.818]  Thanks for holding, Alex.
[01:55:50.838 --> 01:55:51.259]  You're on the air.
[01:55:52.529 --> 01:55:53.089]  How are you doing?
[01:55:53.549 --> 01:55:59.052]  Alright, I am a Prison Planet, first of all, I'm a Prison Planet TV subscriber.
[01:55:59.072 --> 01:56:00.812]  Thank you.
[01:56:01.173 --> 01:56:06.655]  Firstly, I want to address me and a couple other people on the forums at Prison Planet TV.
[01:56:06.675 --> 01:56:19.800]  I've been having a problem where the day that we send payment, we get locked out for a day and then when we get back, our real information is put up instead of our username for everyone to see.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:21.581]  And I don't care because I've already committed.
[01:56:22.428 --> 01:56:22.829]  No, no, no.
[01:56:23.789 --> 01:56:24.370]  First, let me do this.
[01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:25.451]  Number one, the phone's echoing.
[01:56:25.471 --> 01:56:26.371]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:56:26.491 --> 01:56:28.613]  I can't do customer service on air.
[01:56:29.414 --> 01:56:30.815]  And I will find out what's happening.
[01:56:30.835 --> 01:56:32.676]  I'll get Paul Watson on the phone.
[01:56:32.696 --> 01:56:33.977]  You realize it's one guy running that.
[01:56:33.997 --> 01:56:35.078]  It's Paul Watson and his brother.
[01:56:35.138 --> 01:56:37.720]  Really, one and a half guys, because he's running another website.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:40.062]  We don't have the money for the staff.
[01:56:40.102 --> 01:56:41.463]  I'm trying to hire more people.
[01:56:41.523 --> 01:56:42.664]  I'm trying to get money in here.
[01:56:43.132 --> 01:56:46.574]  What I do is I sell advertising, then just to hire people to try to do customer service.
[01:56:46.915 --> 01:56:48.656]  And we've gotten really good about customer service.
[01:56:48.676 --> 01:56:50.557]  We used to be horrible on the video shipments.
[01:56:50.617 --> 01:56:51.138]  Now we're good.
[01:56:51.478 --> 01:56:54.880]  We're trying to get... I mean, we had the problems with servers.
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:55.801]  A bunch of stuff happened.
[01:56:56.577 --> 01:56:58.118]  So we'll try to figure out what's happening, sir.
[01:56:58.438 --> 01:57:01.139]  But on air, I don't even know how this stuff works.
[01:57:01.159 --> 01:57:02.359]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[01:57:02.719 --> 01:57:03.660]  So I can't really help you.
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:05.080]  And again, it's a Catch-22.
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:06.160]  We don't screen your calls.
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:08.081]  So you can call in here and talk about whatever you want.
[01:57:08.761 --> 01:57:09.462]  I don't even really care.
[01:57:09.842 --> 01:57:12.202]  The point is, is that I do care about you specifically.
[01:57:12.222 --> 01:57:17.204]  I want to try to help you so I can find out what on this green earth is going on.
[01:57:17.224 --> 01:57:19.265]  I mean, I got one of my IT guys I can't even get a hold of.
[01:57:20.281 --> 01:57:22.342]  Uh, and uh, there's gonna be some changes on that.
[01:57:23.023 --> 01:57:24.183]  Uh, so uh, you know.
[01:57:24.504 --> 01:57:26.405]  Basically, sir, it's like everybody else in this economy.
[01:57:26.805 --> 01:57:28.286]  Everything is falling apart, okay?
[01:57:30.287 --> 01:57:31.588]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:33.629 --> 01:57:38.292]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.322 --> 01:57:50.962]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.623 --> 01:57:52.683]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.383 --> 01:57:54.504]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.164 --> 01:57:55.964]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.725 --> 01:57:57.645]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.285 --> 01:58:01.967]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.487 --> 01:58:06.569]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:17.973 --> 01:58:20.034]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[01:58:21.335 --> 01:58:24.297]  We are now into this third and final hour on this Friday edition.
[01:58:24.777 --> 01:58:34.622]  Luke Rudowsky will be joining us coming up in 30 minutes with all the big developments, confronting the mayor repeatedly on 9-11, confronting him on the ban on cameras in New York and free speech, basically.
[01:58:35.663 --> 01:58:39.084]  The upcoming 9-11 truth events in New York on September 11th.
[01:58:39.104 --> 01:58:40.045]  That's all coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:58:40.305 --> 01:58:45.428]  For the next 30 minutes, we're joined by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, one of the former editors of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:58:45.948 --> 01:58:53.030]  Of course, the father of Reaganomics, number two in the Chief Economist, of course, the Treasury for Ronald Reagan, and a syndicative columnist.
[01:58:53.090 --> 01:58:58.892]  And he's got the floor because I want to get from him what's really happening with the economy, where he sees all this going.
[01:58:58.932 --> 01:59:03.693]  Does he agree with Joseph Stiglitz, former Chief Economist of the World Bank, who said eight months ago here,
[01:59:04.373 --> 01:59:06.575]  Well, you were speaking about the current
[01:59:30.798 --> 01:59:33.600]  Stock market troubles and housing market troubles?
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:36.621]  And or are you speaking more generally?
[01:59:36.981 --> 01:59:38.902]  Whatever you think is most important, you're the expert.
[01:59:39.163 --> 01:59:48.467]  Okay, well let's start with what's going on right now and then get on to what's been going on for some time.
[01:59:48.548 --> 01:59:49.568]  They're all dangerous.
[01:59:52.570 --> 01:59:58.313]  The world changed two days ago when early in the morning
[01:59:59.591 --> 02:00:20.442]  Two important spokespersons for the Chinese government announced, in their own way of course, that China controls the US interest rate, not the Federal Reserve.
[02:00:24.484 --> 02:00:25.925]  It took the people
[02:00:26.872 --> 02:00:39.482]  On Wall Street, you know, about 24 hours to comprehend because they're so full of hubris and self-importance and we're a superpower and rah-rah and all that.
[02:00:42.004 --> 02:00:50.070]  It was initially dismissed, as the Treasury Secretary Paulson said, utter nonsense.
[02:00:51.727 --> 02:01:21.048]  I invited Donald on Wall Street that, you know, maybe it isn't nonsense, because as the two Chinese folks pointed out, the status of the United States dollar as reserve currency depends more than anything on the goodwill of China, because they're holding about a trillion dollars in
[02:01:21.698 --> 02:01:24.540]  Dollar denominated assets heavily weighted with U.S.
[02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:44.176]  Treasury bonds and their willingness to hold those financial instruments even as the dollar depreciates and their willingness to continue buying them is the only reason the market for Treasury bonds clears.
[02:01:45.817 --> 02:01:46.318]  Otherwise
[02:01:47.423 --> 02:01:53.006]  The huge oversupply would drive down the price of the bonds, which means the interest rate rises.
[02:01:55.308 --> 02:02:00.991]  And if they were also to sell their great holdings of U.S.
[02:02:01.051 --> 02:02:09.376]  dollars in the currency markets, the value of the dollar would also head down.
[02:02:09.536 --> 02:02:15.159]  So a situation in the United States where the dollar was collapsing and interest rates were rising would be catastrophic.
[02:02:16.972 --> 02:02:29.918]  And instantly we would not be able to finance the operations of federal government because it is financed, it's huge deficits are financed by foreign lending of which China is the biggest lender.
[02:02:31.339 --> 02:02:42.764]  So, their announcement two days ago that actually they control our interest rates was a way of telling... Stay there, we gotta break, gotta break for the clock, this is incredibly important, stay with us folks.
[02:02:48.946 --> 02:02:54.408]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.769 --> 02:03:02.412]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.092 --> 02:03:10.156]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.556 --> 02:03:21.962]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.302 --> 02:03:25.824]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:28.206]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.526 --> 02:03:32.288]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.484 --> 02:03:50.568]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:50.628 --> 02:03:57.954]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:58.094 --> 02:04:08.743]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:08.923 --> 02:04:13.467]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:13.507 --> 02:04:13.847]  I think?

[02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:20.150]  I don't know.
[02:05:50.305 --> 02:05:50.965]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.606 --> 02:05:52.666]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.387 --> 02:05:54.507]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.148 --> 02:05:55.968]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.729 --> 02:05:57.609]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.629 --> 02:06:02.151]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.472 --> 02:06:06.554]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:13.935 --> 02:06:16.296]  You know, a lot of times you miss the forest for the trees.
[02:06:16.316 --> 02:06:26.217]  I've been covering all the financial news, the 400 point drop in the stock market, the housing market, the loans to illegal aliens without even ID cards.
[02:06:28.218 --> 02:06:35.579]  And of course, a lot of this, the market going down, and even in Europe, in the 96 billion dollar bailout,
[02:06:36.923 --> 02:06:38.283]  That's 96 billion pound.
[02:06:39.244 --> 02:06:43.605]  That's like 200 billion dollars in Europe or the European Central Bank.
[02:06:44.786 --> 02:06:45.766]  What's happening here?
[02:06:47.486 --> 02:06:50.487]  China comes out who holds 1.3 trillion in these treasuries.
[02:06:52.766 --> 02:06:53.367]  Yes, we are.
[02:07:11.987 --> 02:07:17.510]  Okay, as I was saying briefly, the Chinese two days ago changed the world because it let the world know that the United States interest rates are really up to them if they wish it to be so.
[02:07:17.530 --> 02:07:18.291]  If they can trump any action
[02:07:41.710 --> 02:08:04.125]  That the Federal Reserve could possibly take, or any other central bank, because of their vast holdings of Treasury securities and American dollars, both of which are looked at askance, because they are in excess supplies all over the world, due to American budget and trade deficits for so many years.
[02:08:05.046 --> 02:08:08.008]  So, when they said that, it took a while for it to soak in.
[02:08:09.279 --> 02:08:16.043]  And at first people denied it and said, oh well, it's not a credible threat because they can't dump the bonds without hurting themselves.
[02:08:17.284 --> 02:08:28.791]  But this was a mindless statement because I've done the calculations and it's actually cheaper for China to dump the bonds than to yield to our pressures.
[02:08:29.972 --> 02:08:38.037]  And you may know that Treasury Secretary Paulson is just back from Beijing where he ordered the Chinese to revalue their currency
[02:08:39.735 --> 02:08:40.315]  Immediately.
[02:08:41.816 --> 02:08:47.760]  Well, that was about the stupidest thing anybody could have done, because that's what provoked the Chinese to make their announcement.
[02:08:48.701 --> 02:08:52.344]  And their announcement is to let everybody know they're not going to be bullied.
[02:08:53.425 --> 02:08:54.245]  And if the U.S.
[02:08:54.485 --> 02:08:58.969]  persists in thinking it has hedged enemy over Chinese economic policy, the U.S.
[02:08:59.049 --> 02:09:07.755]  is going to find itself in a financial crisis much larger than the kind people are worried about now, the housing subprime derivatives and so on.
[02:09:08.399 --> 02:09:14.742]  So that is a big change in the world and it may be affecting the market.
[02:09:14.802 --> 02:09:19.124]  On the other hand, the market may not be smart enough to figure that out.
[02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:26.088]  And it may be that the market is only being affected by fears over subprime mortgages and derivatives.
[02:09:27.549 --> 02:09:36.233]  In which case, if the Chinese bombshell is still to be figured out by the market, it's going to get much worse.
[02:09:37.532 --> 02:10:00.768]  On the other hand, the Chinese announcement, if there is any sense in Washington and Wall Street, which you sometimes wonder, will result in the United States government quietly telling China, very quietly, that, oh, say, we've rethought this business about you revaluing your currency, and we're very glad of your support of the U.S.
[02:10:00.828 --> 02:10:02.449]  dollar, and that then would end the crisis.
[02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:05.531]  So it's a crisis that could be ended.
[02:10:06.488 --> 02:10:09.109]  By some common sense in Washington, which is rare.
[02:10:09.909 --> 02:10:24.153]  Or, if it's this neoconservative, hedge-enemy, superpower attitude, and we're going to teach those Chinese, they're going to get their asses kicked, and you're going to see a fantastic economic catastrophe.
[02:10:24.193 --> 02:10:27.193]  So it depends on the intelligence in Washington.
[02:10:27.233 --> 02:10:33.375]  Just to sum this up, I have this to say that the Americans have been
[02:10:34.218 --> 02:10:38.539]  Too full of superpower hubris for too long.
[02:10:39.799 --> 02:10:48.641]  And now Americans are going to have to learn how to live and think in the real world, not in the delusional world in which they've been living.
[02:10:49.742 --> 02:10:51.262]  That time is over.
[02:10:52.302 --> 02:11:00.124]  If they can't wise up and behave intelligently, they're going to come to a very fast end.
[02:11:00.764 --> 02:11:03.865]  Now, let me add one other thing before you go on another break.
[02:11:04.915 --> 02:11:11.297]  Now quickly, strategic thinkers looking at China's actions are reading more into it.
[02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:23.641]  They're saying that China could care less about American pressures to revalue their currency, and that what this warning is really about is, don't you dare attack Iran!
[02:11:24.682 --> 02:11:33.885]  Don't you dare start any more wars, especially when we have energy interests in Iran, and when our growing economy
[02:11:35.014 --> 02:11:41.296]  Benefits from our trade with Iran and the pipelines that we are investing in.
[02:11:41.356 --> 02:11:43.076]  Don't you dare!
[02:11:43.897 --> 02:11:45.797]  If you do, we're going to pull the plug.
[02:11:46.017 --> 02:11:56.000]  And Dr. Roberts, if they've read the PNAC documents, which we know the Chinese have, it says that this strategy ends at China's doorstep in encirclement.
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:58.060]  So they know that's part of the strategy.
[02:11:58.501 --> 02:12:03.782]  Well, the neocons have made it clear that they think that we're going to impose hedge enemy on China.
[02:12:04.301 --> 02:12:11.189]  So China and Russia this week formed a military alliance, and now they're holding joint military maneuvers just as we speak.
[02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:20.459]  And if the United States military can't occupy Baghdad in Iraq, it damn sure can't occupy China and Russia.
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:25.545]  So the kind of war that the neocons are pushing for would be a nuclear war.
[02:12:26.463 --> 02:12:27.283]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:12:27.343 --> 02:12:29.904]  We've seen this throughout history, and you've been around a lot of these powerful people.
[02:12:30.504 --> 02:12:35.446]  But people in the past who really weren't powerful understood soft power and that it's like a big engine.
[02:12:35.486 --> 02:12:37.446]  You overdrive it, it's going to throw a rod.
[02:12:37.926 --> 02:12:40.607]  The neocons are a bunch of chicken-neck cowards.
[02:12:40.627 --> 02:12:44.728]  I mean, you look at their MO, a lot of them aren't even that smart.
[02:12:44.768 --> 02:12:46.649]  They've always gotten away with whatever they're doing.
[02:12:47.782 --> 02:12:49.383]  What do you think is wrong with Israel?
[02:12:49.423 --> 02:12:52.564]  What do you think at the base is wrong with the neocons?
[02:12:52.604 --> 02:12:53.984]  What is wrong even with England?
[02:12:54.384 --> 02:12:55.905]  Now they're starting to back off a little bit.
[02:12:56.885 --> 02:12:59.746]  Do they just think they can start World War III and that they're going to win it?
[02:12:59.986 --> 02:13:05.127]  I mean, why are they so confident when they don't have anything to be confident about?
[02:13:06.168 --> 02:13:07.768]  Yeah, it's exactly what you said.
[02:13:08.128 --> 02:13:08.989]  They're not smart.
[02:13:10.538 --> 02:13:11.739]  Our bosses used to be.
[02:13:11.799 --> 02:13:13.520]  They're numb.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:15.361]  They have the mentality of Brownshirts.
[02:13:15.381 --> 02:13:17.222]  You know, why did Hitler march off into Russia?
[02:13:17.262 --> 02:13:18.363]  I mean, it didn't make any sense.
[02:13:19.423 --> 02:13:21.805]  So, that's the problem.
[02:13:22.565 --> 02:13:23.346]  They aren't smart.
[02:13:24.286 --> 02:13:32.491]  The trouble with Israel is the Zionists there, which are a minority, and they bully the rest of the Israeli population and scare them to death.
[02:13:33.075 --> 02:13:49.809]  by provoking terrorist incidents and control the population in that way and they're paranoid and they think that they have to rely on coercion and violence because the Arabs hate them and that they can't make peace with people who hate us, we can only fight them.
[02:13:49.849 --> 02:13:53.472]  So that's the huge mistake that Israel has made for half of a century.
[02:13:54.573 --> 02:13:59.817]  Here, they've been very effective in controlling the explanation of the Israeli
[02:14:00.522 --> 02:14:16.407]  uh... arab conflict israeli palestinian conflict they've been very effective as fundraisers and uh... being able to elect or defeat whoever they want whatever president whatever senator whatever uh... congressman and so they have enormous
[02:14:17.789 --> 02:14:20.591]  But that's only here.
[02:14:20.651 --> 02:14:23.493]  The baloney, the BS only goes so far.
[02:14:24.534 --> 02:14:27.696]  Well, why does Britain do it?
[02:14:27.776 --> 02:14:29.558]  Because, well, we pay them.
[02:14:30.178 --> 02:14:31.399]  They're dependent on us.
[02:14:35.242 --> 02:14:40.746]  Tony Blair, probably, is being paid in many ways.
[02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.407]  He'll be put on many boards.
[02:14:43.345 --> 02:14:52.868]  He'll be protected from the International Criminal Court for his war crimes because, you know, he did sign that war crime agreement, so he would be vulnerable.
[02:14:53.468 --> 02:14:56.789]  We offer all kinds of protections and monies to people.
[02:14:57.489 --> 02:15:03.851]  We control Pakistan because we pay their president over there, and the same in Egypt.
[02:15:03.891 --> 02:15:05.192]  We pay them.
[02:15:05.252 --> 02:15:06.012]  We give them money.
[02:15:06.972 --> 02:15:13.074]  I don't mean for their country, but we do do that, but they personally
[02:15:13.601 --> 02:15:14.901]  Well, Dr. Roberts,
[02:15:40.743 --> 02:15:47.566]  They moved to a basket, as you know, a year and a half ago, globally starting to creep away from the dollar, but now we're seeing an acceleration away from it.
[02:15:48.166 --> 02:15:50.767]  I mean, if you had to project forward, what do you think is likely?
[02:15:52.948 --> 02:15:57.549]  Well, it depends so much on whether there's any intelligence in Washington.
[02:15:59.410 --> 02:16:06.773]  And, you know, you have to wonder how many times they stepped on the King Cobra before they decide not to step on him again.
[02:16:10.035 --> 02:16:14.839]  And so it could all just end without any more trouble.
[02:16:14.859 --> 02:16:17.140]  I mean, they could wise up and say, hey, you know what?
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:19.562]  We've overestimated our cloud.
[02:16:20.182 --> 02:16:21.904]  We didn't realize how vulnerable we are.
[02:16:21.924 --> 02:16:24.105]  We're going to have to get along with people.
[02:16:24.205 --> 02:16:29.529]  We can't any longer say that we are superpower or unchecked by anything.
[02:16:29.569 --> 02:16:32.711]  We don't have to pay attention to public opinion here or anywhere else in the world.
[02:16:33.512 --> 02:16:37.715]  If they give all that up, then all this
[02:16:38.615 --> 02:16:43.439]  It can be stabilized and nothing really much happens other than those bad subprime mortgages.
[02:16:43.459 --> 02:16:45.981]  A lot of them are going to fail.
[02:16:46.101 --> 02:16:56.670]  But if they don't, they're going to provoke the destruction of the United States government's credit.
[02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:57.770]  They won't be able to borrow.
[02:16:57.791 --> 02:17:00.112]  They won't be able to fund the government.
[02:17:00.733 --> 02:17:03.415]  They're going to destroy the dollar as a reserve currency.
[02:17:03.815 --> 02:17:05.617]  It will be like any other country.
[02:17:05.657 --> 02:17:08.139]  We won't have the ability to
[02:17:09.054 --> 02:17:12.736]  uh... run red ink indefinitely and trade deficits and budget deficits.
[02:17:12.776 --> 02:17:14.337]  That will all end immediately.
[02:17:14.357 --> 02:17:22.222]  uh... We will probably provoke a war that could develop into the use of nuclear weapons.
[02:17:22.402 --> 02:17:28.305]  So it is a very dangerous situation given the current stupidity of our government in Washington.
[02:17:29.386 --> 02:17:32.528]  Is it stupidity or is it just arrogant nihilistic
[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:35.021]  Wanton bloodlust.
[02:17:35.421 --> 02:17:36.361]  It's all of those things.
[02:17:36.621 --> 02:17:39.663]  Another segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the other side.
[02:17:39.683 --> 02:17:40.263]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.226 --> 02:17:49.167]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:17:49.327 --> 02:17:54.569]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:17:54.849 --> 02:18:00.151]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:18:00.552 --> 02:18:01.612]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:18:02.032 --> 02:18:11.120]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[02:18:45.606 --> 02:18:46.547]  Ted Andrews for Midas.
[02:18:46.728 --> 02:18:47.008]  August 10, 2007.
[02:18:47.288 --> 02:18:47.809]  Gold is at $6.65.
[02:18:47.849 --> 02:18:49.932]  Ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.86, $4.66, $3.38, $7.80 per half, $1.69, $3.35 per quarter.
[02:18:49.952 --> 02:18:50.352]  That's $6.86, $4.66, $3.38, $7.80, and $1.69, $3.35.
[02:19:00.486 --> 02:19:09.989]  The US has begun a campaign of economic threats against the US, hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of US treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yom revolution.
[02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:21.612]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the US housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:19:21.932 --> 02:19:25.875]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:19:26.096 --> 02:19:32.681]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[02:19:32.981 --> 02:19:36.585]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.625 --> 02:19:39.867]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:19:39.947 --> 02:19:40.228]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:40.248 --> 02:19:40.448]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.712 --> 02:19:48.734]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:19:49.054 --> 02:19:53.977]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:19:54.237 --> 02:19:58.579]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:19:58.879 --> 02:20:07.804]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[02:20:11.906 --> 02:20:16.930]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:20:17.230 --> 02:20:23.936]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:25.081]  What about you?

[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:44.020]  Do it today!
[02:21:48.141 --> 02:21:52.883]  Talking to Dr. Roberts during the break, he just said, look, China isn't threatening anything.
[02:21:52.903 --> 02:21:54.183]  They're just saying, we're not going to be bullied.
[02:21:57.398 --> 02:22:06.726]  Dr. Roberts, and we're going to hold you over to the next segment of Libertouts who's coming on, but you were pointing out that I don't think five minutes is going to be enough, so five minutes on the other side.
[02:22:09.248 --> 02:22:12.471]  You know, there's a method to the madness.
[02:22:12.771 --> 02:22:19.416]  They want to bring order out of chaos, and I agree they're nuts, but it's just like Karl Rove said, we control reality.
[02:22:19.436 --> 02:22:22.559]  Now obviously they don't control reality after a certain point,
[02:22:23.533 --> 02:22:27.336]  No, I agree with you that they want war and I also think that they think everybody will roll over and it will be easy.
[02:22:54.817 --> 02:22:57.739]  The question is whether other people will let them.
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:08.027]  So far, they've gotten away with things because no one's really opposed them because of 9-11 and, oh, we're vulnerable to terror and all that.
[02:23:08.807 --> 02:23:18.475]  But as this thing has now escalated to a new level of realization, there are a lot of moneyed, powerful interests that don't want to be destroyed because of these fools.
[02:23:19.468 --> 02:23:20.528]  There are other countries.
[02:23:21.209 --> 02:23:23.990]  There are even the American people who might wake up.
[02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:29.172]  I mean, who knows what realization might prevail.
[02:23:29.232 --> 02:23:33.294]  So they could be stopped regardless of their plans.
[02:23:33.414 --> 02:23:37.736]  Now, let's get on to your observation.
[02:23:38.116 --> 02:23:38.456]  You're right.
[02:23:38.476 --> 02:23:40.817]  The Chinese did not make a threat.
[02:23:40.877 --> 02:23:48.400]  They simply said they're not going to be bullied and that it wasn't appropriate for the United States to be giving orders
[02:23:49.625 --> 02:23:57.610]  To China, who goes out of its way to support the dollar, even though it has depreciated substantially.
[02:23:57.651 --> 02:24:06.837]  They've had huge losses by continuing to hold the dollar, which has declined dramatically against the British Pound, the Euro, and everything else that's tradable.
[02:24:08.138 --> 02:24:15.443]  And they said, here we are, the mainstay of your special borrowing privileges as a reserve currency, and you come over here and give us orders?
[02:24:17.184 --> 02:24:18.705]  So, they're just simply
[02:24:19.318 --> 02:24:21.600]  Telling us that they're not going to be bullied.
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:25.262]  So it's really, the threat is not from China.
[02:24:25.283 --> 02:24:26.323]  The threat's in Washington.
[02:24:27.484 --> 02:24:34.329]  And if the people in Washington persist, they're going to find out that they have more than met their match.
[02:24:34.609 --> 02:24:39.974]  And don't the Chinese, as I've studied their history somewhat, they have a history of not starting stuff, but they will stand up.
[02:24:40.554 --> 02:24:41.455]  Yeah, no, that's right.
[02:24:41.515 --> 02:24:42.876]  You see, they're a rising power.
[02:24:42.896 --> 02:24:44.757]  They're not going to be bullied by declining ones.
[02:24:45.658 --> 02:24:48.520]  And they also said they have no intention of
[02:24:49.099 --> 02:24:50.680]  Causing a financial crisis.
[02:24:51.501 --> 02:24:56.225]  But if the United States persists, they can't guarantee the United States won't cause one.
[02:24:56.985 --> 02:25:00.568]  So, let's don't get everybody mad at the Chinese.
[02:25:00.628 --> 02:25:03.690]  That's not the source of the... That's not my intent.
[02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:06.092]  That's not... The problem is in Washington.
[02:25:06.913 --> 02:25:15.400]  And so, now, let's get on from the immediate crisis, which we've talked about, to the long-term crisis.
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:17.061]  First of all, the long-term crisis
[02:25:17.563 --> 02:25:26.010]  Yes, indeed, and it's the long-term crisis that produced China's power to grab us by the short hairs.
[02:25:27.151 --> 02:25:44.184]  The long-term crisis is because of the greed of American corporations who wanted to move, who have moved so much of their production of goods and services for the American market offshore to China.
[02:25:44.304 --> 02:25:45.866]  They liquidated their power base!
[02:25:47.147 --> 02:25:47.368]  No.
[02:25:47.708 --> 02:25:48.328]  No, they didn't.
[02:25:48.529 --> 02:25:53.893]  They liquidated the career opportunities for the American population.
[02:25:53.973 --> 02:25:56.015]  But I see that as a power base for this, you know.
[02:25:56.495 --> 02:26:04.221]  No, what they did, they moved their power base to China, where labor was cheaper, regulatory costs were cheaper, harassment costs were cheaper.
[02:26:04.662 --> 02:26:15.050]  They moved there, and so what happened was, what used to be American gross domestic product was transformed into imports, because the goods
[02:26:16.639 --> 02:26:25.643]  The American brand name goods that are sold to us in Walmart and everywhere else are made by American firms who have located the production in China.
[02:26:26.563 --> 02:26:34.626]  So this meant China's exports went way up because offshore production that comes back into the country is considered an export.
[02:26:35.266 --> 02:26:44.590]  And it meant that they accumulated tremendous reserves as the creditor because they had the trade surplus, we were the debtor.
[02:26:45.293 --> 02:26:46.915]  So that's where the reserves came from.
[02:26:46.975 --> 02:27:03.433]  The reserves that China has now, that gives them control over American interest rates, were created by the greedy American corporations and all the free trade, free market economists who encouraged the movement of American production offshore to China.
[02:27:03.814 --> 02:27:05.676]  So that's where their power came from.
[02:27:06.937 --> 02:27:12.178]  And this move also destroyed the ladders of upward mobility in the United States.
[02:27:12.918 --> 02:27:14.058]  And we've talked many times.
[02:27:14.118 --> 02:27:18.299]  The jobs that are created here are waitresses, bartenders, hospital orderlies, that type of thing.
[02:27:18.319 --> 02:27:18.799]  Stay there.
[02:27:19.119 --> 02:27:20.119]  One more final segment.
[02:27:20.139 --> 02:27:30.661]  I want you to be able to get into where this is going from your expertise, your expert opinion, and then how we can hopefully have a softer crash landing or if there's any hope at all financially.
[02:27:30.821 --> 02:27:31.441]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.811 --> 02:27:37.032]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.212 --> 02:27:38.833]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.853 --> 02:27:42.496]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.798 --> 02:27:51.302]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:51.722 --> 02:27:55.965]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:56.385 --> 02:28:03.250]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:10.377]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:10.698 --> 02:28:12.320]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:15.803]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:16.084 --> 02:28:18.526]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:28:18.847 --> 02:28:25.574]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:28:32.781 --> 02:28:34.542]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:28:46.713 --> 02:28:53.516]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:28:53.876 --> 02:29:00.278]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:29:00.759 --> 02:29:10.662]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:29:11.143 --> 02:29:14.604]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:29:14.904 --> 02:29:17.605]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:29:18.206 --> 02:29:20.907]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[02:29:21.467 --> 02:29:23.388]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.

[02:29:51.705 --> 02:29:56.866]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:29:57.827 --> 02:30:01.928]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[02:30:02.368 --> 02:30:11.050]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:30:11.850 --> 02:30:17.132]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[02:30:18.044 --> 02:30:25.327]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:30:26.087 --> 02:30:26.607]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:30:26.627 --> 02:30:26.947]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:30:26.987 --> 02:30:28.728]  It's absolutely free.
[02:30:28.948 --> 02:30:32.729]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[02:30:32.769 --> 02:30:33.350]  Just call right now.
[02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:54.518]  The creature man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[02:30:59.444 --> 02:31:05.251]  The interest is up and the stocks market down and you only get mugged if you go downtown.
[02:31:11.258 --> 02:31:11.978]  Welcome back!
[02:31:35.481 --> 02:31:37.762]  We got Luke Wadowski waiting in the wings.
[02:31:38.322 --> 02:31:40.663]  We're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts right now.
[02:31:41.423 --> 02:31:44.005]  And he's very concerned, obviously I'm very concerned.
[02:31:44.025 --> 02:31:49.847]  You don't have to be an economist or an award-winning economist or a global top economist to see that this country's in trouble.
[02:31:50.807 --> 02:31:58.550]  I mean, I remember back when I was in college, they sent me credit cards four or five times a week, and now that I've got a little bit of money in the bank, I'm not in debt, I don't really get sent credit cards.
[02:31:58.570 --> 02:32:02.272]  I mean, this has been a deliberate policy to get control of people and get them in debt.
[02:32:03.967 --> 02:32:13.091]  And now we've had our economy debased, our industry offshored, Halliburton's moved to Dubai, there's a mass exodus.
[02:32:13.111 --> 02:32:16.553]  If it wasn't already huge enough, it's gotten even more pronounced.
[02:32:17.513 --> 02:32:21.975]  Dr. Roberts, during the break we were talking, you talked about Cheney urging another strike on Iran.
[02:32:22.916 --> 02:32:24.276]  He looks like death warmed over.
[02:32:24.296 --> 02:32:26.137]  I don't think he should be running anything.
[02:32:26.697 --> 02:32:28.098]  He looks completely mentally ill.
[02:32:28.118 --> 02:32:30.159]  When you look at somebody, he looks like a complete lunatic.
[02:32:30.822 --> 02:32:31.782]  Looks like a big lizard.
[02:32:32.422 --> 02:32:33.723]  His actions are insane.
[02:32:34.943 --> 02:32:51.067]  Just in closing, where do you see all this going if you had to make a guesstimation, and how do we avert what you were talking about with the debasing of the economy and two generations of college graduates or more with master's degrees now bartending?
[02:32:52.734 --> 02:32:59.918]  Okay, I think it's certain that the subprime mortgages, a number of those are going to unwind.
[02:32:59.938 --> 02:33:04.640]  There's going to be a lot of people losing their houses, several million.
[02:33:05.601 --> 02:33:13.885]  This will cause, you know, various financial pains in the system, but it shouldn't really be affecting stock equities.
[02:33:15.146 --> 02:33:17.587]  Subprime loans shouldn't be affecting the stock market.
[02:33:17.607 --> 02:33:19.448]  That's why I think it could be this China thing.
[02:33:21.441 --> 02:33:23.463]  Where is it going to go other than that?
[02:33:24.103 --> 02:33:27.146]  That depends, as we said, on the intelligence in Washington.
[02:33:30.109 --> 02:33:42.440]  There's a chance, I think, that even the neoconservatives and even Cheney don't have enough hubris and arrogance to think they can take on China in a financial dispute at the same time that they attack Iran.
[02:33:44.222 --> 02:33:45.963]  That's beyond them, I think.
[02:33:47.516 --> 02:33:55.740]  So, it's entirely possible Cheney will tell Paulson to cool it with China because Cheney wants to attack Iran.
[02:33:56.760 --> 02:34:05.004]  And so, we'll have to see whether other players in the system can block the insanity of attacking Iran.
[02:34:05.144 --> 02:34:06.184]  Now, you know Cheney.
[02:34:06.204 --> 02:34:06.785]  You've met Cheney.
[02:34:06.805 --> 02:34:07.765]  You were in the Reagan administration.
[02:34:07.785 --> 02:34:08.385]  You've been around him.
[02:34:08.746 --> 02:34:09.986]  Why do they just love war?
[02:34:15.589 --> 02:34:17.430]  There may be different explanations.
[02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:18.430]  I can offer a couple.
[02:34:18.610 --> 02:34:27.334]  One, the Republicans, when he was a young man, for example, in the Ford White House, Cheney was very much frustrated
[02:34:28.078 --> 02:34:37.020]  That the President couldn't do anything because the Democratic Congress was blocking them all the time, and in foreign affairs, the Soviets were blocking them.
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:40.141]  And he's just tired of being blocked all his life and frustrated.
[02:34:40.161 --> 02:34:43.721]  He wants to strike out and assert American power.
[02:34:43.781 --> 02:34:45.202]  So that could be one explanation.
[02:34:46.162 --> 02:34:49.203]  The long, you know, long-brewing resentment.
[02:34:49.243 --> 02:34:52.923]  That inability to let somebody feel the power.
[02:34:53.123 --> 02:34:55.944]  And another one can be that he's
[02:34:56.916 --> 02:35:04.502]  Since he's been older and more mature, he's been associated with the defense industry, and this is a chance for them to get stinking rich.
[02:35:06.183 --> 02:35:08.325]  And therefore, he has a material interest.
[02:35:08.685 --> 02:35:10.466]  It's a cocktail of those together, isn't it?
[02:35:10.546 --> 02:35:13.208]  Yeah, and a cocktail of those together can explain it.
[02:35:13.268 --> 02:35:19.193]  And then, of course, there's all this neocon ideology, and you get people marching around thinking they're Napoleon.
[02:35:20.313 --> 02:35:23.476]  So that could be that explanation of Cheney.
[02:35:24.835 --> 02:35:45.960]  The big problem, however, remains, and the big problem is that so much of American production of goods and services for American markets is moved offshore, or is filled with foreigners here on work visas, so that the opportunities for college-educated Americans are declining dramatically.
[02:35:46.361 --> 02:35:47.821]  As I've told you before in this program,
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:54.984]  So far in the 21st century, not a single net new job has been created in tradable goods and services.
[02:35:55.725 --> 02:36:07.072]  The jobs for professionals that have to do with engineers, computer engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, all those jobs are disappearing because all that stuff has moved offshore.
[02:36:08.633 --> 02:36:13.216]  And so what we are doing is graduating all these people who've got no careers.
[02:36:14.936 --> 02:36:16.857]  And they've got huge student debts piled up.
[02:36:37.944 --> 02:36:38.404]  Liberty.
[02:36:38.564 --> 02:36:42.007]  It's a very politically unstable... But it's perfect for elites.
[02:36:42.107 --> 02:36:44.228]  In closing, how do we reverse that?
[02:36:44.829 --> 02:36:46.970]  Is there any levers left?
[02:36:49.231 --> 02:36:51.653]  We can't do anything until we get realization.
[02:36:52.754 --> 02:37:05.482]  And I think people may be more aware now that China has a certain amount of power to exercise than they are aware of what offshoring has done to the United States and to
[02:37:06.147 --> 02:37:09.449]  The careers of future generations of Americans.
[02:37:09.509 --> 02:37:11.050]  I think there's less awareness there.
[02:37:11.070 --> 02:37:19.776]  So people have to get educated first, and get mad, and really learn about the system before we're going to turn anything around.
[02:37:20.036 --> 02:37:26.240]  Yeah, and even then, it's going to be hard because, look, to run for President, you've got to raise $100 million.
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:28.981]  To run for Congress, you've got to raise at least $20 million.
[02:37:29.582 --> 02:37:33.104]  There are only about four or five big, powerful-moneyed interest groups
[02:37:33.777 --> 02:37:36.699]  But finance these campaigns so they end up controlling the government.
[02:37:37.139 --> 02:37:40.601]  So, that in one sense may be our salvation now.
[02:37:40.681 --> 02:37:44.903]  I'm not sure those big groups want to march into Armageddon.
[02:37:45.709 --> 02:37:49.770]  In the Middle East, and they don't want to march into the destruction of the dollar.
[02:37:50.011 --> 02:37:58.674]  Well, we know from different globalist meetings, even public ones like Davos and Bilderberg, that now about 65% of the elite do not like what's happening.
[02:37:59.054 --> 02:38:04.856]  And for the first time since Bretton Woods, there are real fishers now where they're actually screaming at each other.
[02:38:05.076 --> 02:38:05.276]  Yeah.
[02:38:05.376 --> 02:38:12.698]  Well, they're threatened now by these idiot neocons and by this moron in the White House and by this sicko vice president.
[02:38:12.738 --> 02:38:14.459]  They're threatened by it and they now realize it.
[02:38:15.203 --> 02:38:18.684]  And who knows whether they can do anything about it.
[02:38:18.805 --> 02:38:28.829]  I don't know if they can or not, but I do know that they realize that it's a threat to their... Why did the elite then ever let this neocon bunch in control?
[02:38:30.889 --> 02:38:39.413]  Because I think they saw it as a way of increasing power in the presidency, which they expect to control.
[02:38:41.079 --> 02:38:47.461]  And through increasing power in the American Presidency, increasing their power and hegemony over the rest of the world.
[02:38:47.541 --> 02:38:53.902]  I think they saw the neocons as dupes and tools of their own strategies.
[02:38:56.222 --> 02:39:04.984]  But it turned out that the neocons were an independent force, and they're backed by Israel, which has its own purposes in the world.
[02:39:05.024 --> 02:39:06.685]  They're independent of the Bilderbergs.
[02:39:09.610 --> 02:39:12.352]  It got to be a confusing situation.
[02:39:24.036 --> 02:39:27.637]  Aware that the situation developed differently than they hoped.
[02:39:27.958 --> 02:39:37.741]  In closing, and I want to beg you to come on in the next few weeks as this develops for a full hour, because it's obvious you've got a lot more to talk about, and it really fits with the research I've done, and we're really honored to have this much of your time, sir.
[02:39:38.582 --> 02:39:48.946]  In closing, pitching for more dead Americans, a neocon fetish, that's our headline at PrisonPlanet.com, but there was a big story in the Philadelphia News yesterday
[02:39:49.984 --> 02:39:52.446]  With the headline, you know, wishing for another 9-11.
[02:39:52.786 --> 02:39:55.168]  How 9-11 could, another 9-11 could save America.
[02:39:55.809 --> 02:40:02.534]  And we've got all these former senators and members of Congress, Republican memos saying they need another 9-11.
[02:40:02.935 --> 02:40:09.380]  And now they've got actual front page, big editorials, an editorial page, saying another 9-11 would be good?
[02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:12.843]  I mean, are they just going to come right out and start, just start admitting it or something?
[02:40:12.863 --> 02:40:13.884]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:40:15.404 --> 02:40:22.648]  Well, as we've talked the other day, the Republican Party desperately needs a 9-11 so that it's not wiped out in the 2008 election.
[02:40:23.508 --> 02:40:29.231]  And I think there is a good chance that if the terrorists don't do one, they'll be inclined to do one themselves.
[02:40:31.323 --> 02:40:38.269]  Well, we're all going to, I guess, be here to see it happen, at least most of us will be living the next few months, the next few years to see this unfold.
[02:40:39.069 --> 02:40:45.235]  How far, how long until you think this shakes out one way or the other on whether they're going to go into Iran?
[02:40:45.255 --> 02:40:47.236]  We know they've got the biggest group of carriers massed.
[02:40:47.256 --> 02:40:49.698]  We know they're talking about going in even this month.
[02:40:49.738 --> 02:40:51.840]  They're keen to, you know, keep the pressure up.
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:53.521]  Okay, I understand.
[02:40:53.721 --> 02:40:59.086]  It depends, I think, in part on what Russia and China tell us.
[02:40:59.762 --> 02:41:20.533]  And if these strategic thinkers are correct, then what I noted and pointed out really means that China is telling us to rethink Iran and hands off if they don't give a flying crap about the currency pressures, because they're not going to pay attention to that anyhow, and that this is really a message to control our foreign policy.
[02:41:20.753 --> 02:41:27.697]  That this was really an act by China to control our foreign policy and otherwise destroy us.
[02:41:28.431 --> 02:41:30.012]  Financially, without firing a shot.
[02:41:30.072 --> 02:41:34.733]  Now, if that is true, then we won't be able to attack Iran.
[02:41:35.793 --> 02:41:38.694]  Unless we're just so dense that we don't get the message.
[02:41:39.174 --> 02:41:41.715]  Now, I don't know if that's what China meant or not.
[02:41:41.795 --> 02:41:45.756]  If it is what it meant, it'll become increasingly clear.
[02:41:46.256 --> 02:41:54.099]  And also, I think the fact that Chinese and Russians quickly formed a military alliance and a whole and joint military maneuvers and both have announced
[02:41:55.299 --> 02:41:58.980]  Crash programs to upgrade the nuclear strike force.
[02:41:59.321 --> 02:42:01.982]  They've also had their airplanes coming into our airspace again.
[02:42:02.562 --> 02:42:13.366]  Well, that's just to remind us that we are vulnerable and that all this super... See, the Bush administration has fallen into the delusion that Hitler fell into.
[02:42:14.106 --> 02:42:15.106]  That he's invulnerable.
[02:42:16.187 --> 02:42:19.308]  That a tiny country like Germany can occupy Russia.
[02:42:20.128 --> 02:42:21.349]  I mean, it's madness.
[02:42:22.009 --> 02:42:23.069]  Everybody knew it was madness.
[02:42:23.089 --> 02:42:24.670]  His generals knew it was madness.
[02:42:25.146 --> 02:42:26.567]  Nobody believed in that.
[02:42:28.688 --> 02:42:31.609]  Stalin thought it was so mad he didn't even defend against it.
[02:42:34.111 --> 02:42:38.393]  And they had initially had great success because it was so audacious.
[02:42:38.413 --> 02:42:39.213]  Until the winter.
[02:42:39.674 --> 02:42:39.934]  Yeah.
[02:42:40.174 --> 02:42:44.116]  Until the Russians said, okay, now you've had it.
[02:42:44.176 --> 02:42:46.877]  You're in far enough that you can't get out alive.
[02:42:48.258 --> 02:42:53.961]  And World War II was lost at Stalingrad long before we ever got involved in Normandy or
[02:42:55.075 --> 02:42:55.616]  It didn't matter.
[02:42:55.716 --> 02:42:56.776]  After that, it didn't matter.
[02:42:56.796 --> 02:43:00.379]  Well, that's what the Asian mind does, and Russia has a lot of that Asian mind.
[02:43:00.399 --> 02:43:01.499]  They always suck you in.
[02:43:01.519 --> 02:43:04.161]  That's what Rutger Kipling wrote about.
[02:43:05.982 --> 02:43:07.063]  You can look at it this way.
[02:43:07.103 --> 02:43:10.765]  China has sucked us in now for a decade in offshoring.
[02:43:11.305 --> 02:43:13.887]  That's where their $1.3 trillion in U.S.
[02:43:14.227 --> 02:43:15.528]  assets came from.
[02:43:15.588 --> 02:43:17.990]  That's where their power over our interest rates came from.
[02:43:19.511 --> 02:43:23.253]  And you had all the American governments egging on
[02:43:24.284 --> 02:43:27.957]  The offshore into China because it would mean cheap goods in Walmart.
[02:43:28.238 --> 02:43:30.425]  And now we're gonna pay the price for those cheap goods.
[02:43:31.847 --> 02:43:32.447]  Absolutely.
[02:43:32.488 --> 02:43:39.912]  Let's do a part two on this in the near future, Dr. Roberts, so folks can read your powerful columns all over the web and at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:39.932 --> 02:43:40.853]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[02:43:41.253 --> 02:43:41.653]  Certainly.
[02:43:41.673 --> 02:43:42.073]  Be glad.
[02:43:42.113 --> 02:43:42.914]  Talk to you anytime.
[02:43:43.254 --> 02:43:43.574]  You bet.
[02:43:44.415 --> 02:43:47.296]  I apologize to Luke Rodowski for holding for 12 minutes.
[02:43:47.497 --> 02:43:49.318]  It's just that Dr. Roberts wanted to stay on.
[02:43:49.338 --> 02:43:50.218]  He doesn't normally.
[02:43:50.238 --> 02:43:52.920]  It's just stuff so bad, folks, right now.
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:59.564]  And I want to get Luke back up on the Sunday show from 4 to 6, maybe for a full hour.
[02:44:00.663 --> 02:44:03.725]  Because 9-11, government-sponsored terror, is the key.
[02:44:03.765 --> 02:44:08.488]  I wanted to have him on today to talk about neocons, writing front-page stories about how they need more terror attacks.
[02:44:08.508 --> 02:44:09.669]  I mean, it's getting obvious now.
[02:44:10.869 --> 02:44:12.470]  There's a big 9-11 event in New York.
[02:44:12.491 --> 02:44:14.932]  This is going to be the 6th anniversary, going into the election.
[02:44:14.952 --> 02:44:17.474]  This is one of the most important, if not the most important anniversary ever.
[02:44:17.914 --> 02:44:21.236]  And Luke, frankly, doesn't have a pot to you-know-what in.
[02:44:21.676 --> 02:44:23.597]  And they've organized some great things in the past.
[02:44:23.698 --> 02:44:28.160]  They need financial support to be able to rent a few of these venues.
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:29.061]  It's a paltry sum.
[02:44:29.833 --> 02:44:30.413]  I don't think so.
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:00.542]  It just gets better and better.
[02:45:01.243 --> 02:45:02.545]  But it's going to be a huge event.
[02:45:03.798 --> 02:45:04.959]  And I'm just flying up there.
[02:45:04.979 --> 02:45:05.780]  I'm just paying for it.
[02:45:05.820 --> 02:45:07.881]  I'm losing money doing it like everybody else is.
[02:45:08.162 --> 02:45:10.023]  We're doing this to tell the truth and take action.
[02:45:10.444 --> 02:45:12.285]  So I hope you'll go to WeAreChange.org.
[02:45:12.805 --> 02:45:14.787]  And I hope that you'll RSVP that you're coming.
[02:45:14.807 --> 02:45:18.070]  I think the event's going to be like $10-$11 a piece if you get them at the door.
[02:45:18.430 --> 02:45:21.012]  Or you can get some pass for a discount and get into all the events.
[02:45:21.032 --> 02:45:25.596]  And they've already scheduled some of them, put a little bit of money they had towards getting those venues, a couple of them secured.
[02:45:25.896 --> 02:45:27.497]  They need money to get a few others secured.
[02:45:27.557 --> 02:45:28.538]  There's plenty of places.
[02:45:28.658 --> 02:45:30.340]  So it's going to be wonderful.
[02:45:30.380 --> 02:45:32.241]  But again, Luke's a 20-year-old.
[02:45:32.281 --> 02:45:32.581]  Is he 21 yet?
[02:45:33.542 --> 02:45:34.163]  We're good to go.
[02:45:48.451 --> 02:45:50.594]  We need some, at least, RSVP.
[02:45:50.774 --> 02:45:51.995]  Or they're going to have it out this weekend.
[02:45:52.055 --> 02:45:53.076]  Go buy one of the passes.
[02:45:53.597 --> 02:45:54.458]  I'm not running it.
[02:45:54.518 --> 02:45:55.579]  I'm not even advising it.
[02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:56.780]  I'm just supporting it.
[02:45:57.201 --> 02:45:58.602]  And so Luke can give you more details.
[02:45:59.263 --> 02:46:02.667]  We end up just talking and strategizing here on air because we don't really talk in private because we're too busy.
[02:46:03.447 --> 02:46:04.769]  Luke, how do folks help you?
[02:46:05.692 --> 02:46:09.614]  I mean, they can help us by our repayment, they can help us by coming down, they can help us by donating.
[02:46:09.714 --> 02:46:10.594]  Anything can be done.
[02:46:10.634 --> 02:46:12.395]  We can virtually do anything.
[02:46:12.735 --> 02:46:14.236]  I mean, do a street action tomorrow.
[02:46:14.296 --> 02:46:14.896]  It's the 11th.
[02:46:14.956 --> 02:46:16.236]  Every 11th, do a street action.
[02:46:16.577 --> 02:46:18.017]  And we can really do anything we want.
[02:46:18.397 --> 02:46:22.119]  And this conference is really going to be the biggest NotElevenTube conference ever.
[02:46:22.399 --> 02:46:23.599]  Last year, we made history.
[02:46:23.639 --> 02:46:25.060]  This year, we're going to make history again.
[02:46:25.500 --> 02:46:27.281]  And be ready to hear emotional stuff.
[02:46:27.321 --> 02:46:34.544]  Be ready to see Don Froder, our new FDNY firefighter representative over rear change, which is going to tell you the truth of what happened that day.
[02:46:35.513 --> 02:46:38.799]  And that video is up on PrisonPlanet.com and WeAreChange.org right now.
[02:46:38.839 --> 02:46:40.462]  You shot that, you're the only one with a loose change crew.
[02:46:43.158 --> 02:46:44.438]  Just just just lay it out there.
[02:46:44.458 --> 02:46:46.539]  Now how many venues have you secured?
[02:46:46.639 --> 02:46:54.380]  Give us a rundown of what's going to be happening and then tell us when the passes will be out so people can buy their pass and then know what they're going to be getting for that.
[02:46:54.721 --> 02:46:58.401]  I mean people could buy tickets right now on wearechange.org slash 9-11-07.
[02:46:58.421 --> 02:47:00.942]  So go to wearechange.org, click on our top banner.
[02:47:01.182 --> 02:47:02.302]  We have a lot of great speakers.
[02:47:02.342 --> 02:47:05.723]  We're going to be mostly hearing from family members who lost loved ones on 9-11.
[02:47:06.463 --> 02:47:07.084]  We're good to go.
[02:47:22.337 --> 02:47:34.451]  I mean, literally, folks, I'm going to show Endgame there, and I'm donating all the proceeds to the firefighters and victims of the police, all of it, you know, after whatever's needed for Luke to pay for the venue and the projectors, and it's expensive.
[02:47:35.472 --> 02:47:37.875]  And so basically, I'm fitting the bill to go up there.
[02:47:37.915 --> 02:47:38.997]  I mean, there was a bunch extra.
[02:47:39.017 --> 02:47:40.879]  Maybe I get my plane tickets paid for, but that never happens.
[02:47:40.899 --> 02:47:41.580]  I don't expect it.
[02:47:42.408 --> 02:47:51.791]  The point is, I made the recommendation, and I'm glad Luke really had the idea and agrees with what I think, that this shouldn't be just a bunch of us jumping around over the 9-11 trade boom.
[02:47:52.091 --> 02:47:57.912]  It needs to be for the media, and also just for these individuals, the firefighters, the policemen, the survivors, the widows.
[02:47:59.573 --> 02:48:04.774]  Luke said, hey, I want you to speak every day, and I said, Luke, I think I'm going to show endgame, maybe give one or two speeches, but that's it.
[02:48:05.374 --> 02:48:11.836]  I really want to be in the audience on this and I want to make this not about, you know, the personalities, the non-love and truth movement.
[02:48:12.056 --> 02:48:14.397]  We need to make this about the survivors and Luca Grace.
[02:48:14.817 --> 02:48:15.577]  And that's what it's about.
[02:48:15.657 --> 02:48:21.219]  We're also going to have Richard Gage and we're probably going to have Immortals Technique and other great artists there as well.
[02:48:21.539 --> 02:48:31.062]  And people need to come and it's really a great way to get out there to make a difference, to do street action, to help out the first responders, to get educated and to see two great films, Endgame and Luke's Change Final Cut.
[02:48:31.082 --> 02:48:32.243]  People can buy tickets right now.
[02:48:32.323 --> 02:48:33.003]  They're limited.
[02:48:33.463 --> 02:48:34.904]  WeAreChange.org.
[02:48:34.924 --> 02:48:36.585]  Snyder, you can finish up on the other side, look.
[02:48:37.185 --> 02:48:38.706]  And it's going to be historical.
[02:48:38.806 --> 02:48:39.967]  I want to see you there.
[02:48:39.987 --> 02:48:49.192]  It's here.
[02:48:49.392 --> 02:48:54.175]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.535 --> 02:49:02.159]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:09.913]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.313 --> 02:49:21.738]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.058 --> 02:49:25.580]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:27.961]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.281 --> 02:49:32.123]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:01.058 --> 02:50:04.061]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:50:04.381 --> 02:50:07.804]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:50:08.144 --> 02:50:17.488]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:17.748 --> 02:50:21.250]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:50:21.490 --> 02:50:28.613]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:50:44.901 --> 02:50:49.004]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[02:50:49.244 --> 02:50:54.327]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[02:50:54.627 --> 02:50:59.270]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[02:50:59.610 --> 02:51:01.571]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[02:51:01.872 --> 02:51:07.735]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:51:08.095 --> 02:51:08.876]  And it works.
[02:51:09.316 --> 02:51:10.757]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[02:51:11.137 --> 02:51:12.158]  Now it's your turn.
[02:51:12.418 --> 02:51:14.779]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:19.202]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[02:51:19.482 --> 02:51:22.604]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[02:51:22.984 --> 02:51:25.186]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[02:51:25.366 --> 02:51:27.727]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:51:27.767 --> 02:51:27.987]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:51:28.008 --> 02:51:29.889]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:51:37.213 --> 02:51:41.978]  I'm going to get Luke on for about 30 minutes, or maybe even an hour, to talk about 9-11 Truth itself.
[02:51:42.078 --> 02:51:47.364]  Coming up this Sunday, live, 4-6 p.m., with a new syndicated Sunday show.
[02:51:47.424 --> 02:51:49.667]  It's not too new now, it's been about 8 months syndicated, about a year total.
[02:52:01.019 --> 02:52:02.621]  I gotta tell you about BedFan, though, folks.
[02:52:02.681 --> 02:52:07.144]  It's a great new sponsor we've got, and I'm one of these people that hates to sleep hot.
[02:52:07.625 --> 02:52:09.547]  And it's a great little bitty fan that, like, slides in.
[02:52:09.567 --> 02:52:10.888]  You gotta check it out at their website.
[02:52:11.749 --> 02:52:12.569]  Very inexpensive.
[02:52:12.910 --> 02:52:13.490]  They designed it.
[02:52:13.530 --> 02:52:14.271]  They patented it.
[02:52:15.031 --> 02:52:16.413]  Uh, and it's just fantastic.
[02:52:16.893 --> 02:52:18.074]  And a lot of people I know use it.
[02:52:18.174 --> 02:52:18.955]  I've got one.
[02:52:19.575 --> 02:52:21.197]  And, uh, it just works fabulously.
[02:52:21.237 --> 02:52:22.098]  I've now tried it out.
[02:52:22.558 --> 02:52:23.979]  It's BedFan.com.
[02:52:24.019 --> 02:52:25.541]  B-E-D Fan.com.
[02:52:25.581 --> 02:52:25.981]  BedFan.com.
[02:52:27.541 --> 02:52:28.702]  Ladies and gentlemen, or 1-800-738-0477.
[02:52:28.763 --> 02:52:34.789]  Give them a call and tell them you want to order a bed fan, 1-800-738-0477.
[02:52:34.969 --> 02:52:43.198]  And you can turn down your air conditioner, not have it as low, and save a lot of money, and then just have this directly on your bed.
[02:52:44.259 --> 02:52:50.405]  Again, 1-800-738-0477 or BedFan.com.
[02:52:51.566 --> 02:52:53.929]  In closing, Luke Rodowski joined us again.
[02:52:53.949 --> 02:52:58.113]  A few days ago I talked to Luke, or about a week ago, and he really needed support then.
[02:52:58.153 --> 02:53:00.976]  He secured four of the five venues.
[02:53:01.016 --> 02:53:05.200]  He needs a little bit of money to secure the fifth venue, so now that's why he's able to sell tickets.
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:18.824]  Uh, to then get, you know, a bunch of flyers, uh, to get other materials, uh, to help, uh, you know, a few of the people they have to bring in, uh, like the architect, uh, Richard Gage, who's now got this huge organization of architects and engineers exposing it.
[02:53:18.904 --> 02:53:19.364]  That's key.
[02:53:19.384 --> 02:53:23.846]  We need new people, we need to show the science, and we need to show the, the victims.
[02:53:24.446 --> 02:53:26.086]  And, uh, so this is gonna be huge.
[02:53:26.426 --> 02:53:34.709]  We are Change.org, and, uh, like I said, Luke, I'll be glad to participate in whatever, uh, venues you want me and everything, but I, I really
[02:53:35.749 --> 02:53:45.912]  I just don't even want this whole thing to be about Alex Jones, the crazy Texan, because this is just so historical what's happening.
[02:53:45.932 --> 02:53:47.253]  WeAreChange.org.
[02:53:47.513 --> 02:53:51.754]  What about just volunteers in the New York area to physically help you in the build-up?
[02:53:51.774 --> 02:53:54.935]  We're only a month away now, folks, from 9-11.
[02:53:54.975 --> 02:53:57.216]  We are a month away right now from 9-11.
[02:53:58.208 --> 02:54:00.269]  Yeah, we need people to email us.
[02:54:00.369 --> 02:54:01.290]  They want to volunteer.
[02:54:01.350 --> 02:54:04.952]  The email is not1107volunteer at gmail.com.
[02:54:05.512 --> 02:54:06.193]  Spread the word.
[02:54:06.233 --> 02:54:06.913]  Tell everybody.
[02:54:06.953 --> 02:54:08.574]  Tell everybody to come to New York City.
[02:54:08.594 --> 02:54:09.955]  We're going to reach critical mass.
[02:54:09.975 --> 02:54:10.935]  We're going to make history.
[02:54:11.215 --> 02:54:19.980]  We're going to show the world that Not 11 Truth is going to stand up for what's right, is going to stand up for the family members and rescue workers, with them both, and stand up for truth and justice.
[02:54:20.221 --> 02:54:22.462]  And we have to do it this year, because if we don't do it this year,
[02:54:23.062 --> 02:54:27.023]  It's going to be really hard for us in the next coming years, especially after the Democrats come in.
[02:54:27.183 --> 02:54:27.504]  That's right.
[02:54:27.524 --> 02:54:29.944]  Now run over some of the events that have already been set.
[02:54:30.144 --> 02:54:31.825]  So now four of the five have been set.
[02:54:32.345 --> 02:54:35.526]  And then explain, though, that's only one-third, I'd say, of everything that's going on.
[02:54:35.586 --> 02:54:38.647]  Most of it is street actions, demonstrations every day.
[02:54:39.267 --> 02:54:41.328]  Folks come for one day, come for all four days.
[02:54:41.388 --> 02:54:42.868]  This is going to be historic.
[02:54:42.908 --> 02:54:45.089]  We had about 2,000 at a march last year.
[02:54:45.389 --> 02:54:48.050]  I'd say about 3,000 total over the two days.
[02:54:48.550 --> 02:54:50.451]  We need to have 10,000 out there, folks.
[02:54:51.047 --> 02:54:51.207]  Yeah.
[02:54:51.448 --> 02:54:56.535]  I mean, for now, Friday, Saturday are street actions until we can get more donations so we can book more venues.
[02:54:56.876 --> 02:54:59.700]  Sunday is going to be Richard Gage, family members, first responders.
[02:54:59.740 --> 02:55:01.142]  We're going to be premiering Endgame.
[02:55:01.323 --> 02:55:02.865]  We're going to be hearing from you, Alex Jones.
[02:55:03.165 --> 02:55:06.791]  And then we're also probably most likely going to have Immortal Technique also do a concert.
[02:55:07.191 --> 02:55:10.956]  Monday we're doing a whole bunch of events, the whole day we're doing the whole event.
[02:55:11.297 --> 02:55:23.472]  There's going to be Not 11 Globalization, Loose Change Final Cut, a Truth Concert, Truth Talk, and of course Tuesday we're going to be out there at Ground Zero early in the morning with the family members, with the rescue workers, standing up for Not 11 Truth.
[02:55:24.073 --> 02:55:30.718]  And afterwards, we're going to have a roundtable discussion between everybody about what we did, how we did it, and how could we do it better at Judson Church.
[02:55:30.998 --> 02:55:32.979]  So again, please donate, please buy tickets right now.
[02:55:32.999 --> 02:55:36.022]  We're going to make history, and this is something people are not going to forget about.
[02:55:36.062 --> 02:55:40.525]  If you come to New York City on 9-11-07, you're bound not to forget it, because this is going to be historic.
[02:55:40.845 --> 02:55:43.567]  And everybody, like you, like me, we're doing it for free.
[02:55:43.607 --> 02:55:46.248]  We're doing it for the rescue workers, which the government is ignoring.
[02:55:46.449 --> 02:55:47.769]  The government is ignoring these guys.
[02:55:47.809 --> 02:55:49.030]  We will not forget these guys.
[02:55:49.050 --> 02:55:50.951]  We will help these guys because they need the help.
[02:55:51.212 --> 02:55:54.133]  The first responders, the police department, the fire department have been ignored.
[02:55:54.173 --> 02:55:58.896]  Yeah, the key is RSVP as he sets up a few of these final venues so he knows what size to get.
[02:55:58.916 --> 02:56:01.278]  He's got a size in the next week here of his final venues.
[02:56:01.758 --> 02:56:04.320]  Luke, I'm going to call you after the show in about 10 minutes.
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:05.821]  I need to discuss a few things with you.
[02:56:06.441 --> 02:56:09.982]  And I'm going to have you pop in on the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:56:10.342 --> 02:56:15.664]  It's out of the studios of NewsRadio 590K LBJ and syndicated via MSN GCN Radio Network.
[02:56:16.004 --> 02:56:17.124]  So thank you so much, Luke.
[02:56:17.404 --> 02:56:18.265]  Thank you so much, brother.
[02:56:18.285 --> 02:56:19.105]  We've got to make history.
[02:56:19.245 --> 02:56:19.585]  You bet.
[02:56:19.605 --> 02:56:22.946]  I want to thank Dr. Roberts for joining us, Luke Rudowsky, and everybody else.
[02:56:22.986 --> 02:56:23.386]  Take care.
