[00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:09.765]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:11.226]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:12.888]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.192]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:21.836]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.012]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, hello and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:36.353]  It is Wednesday, already the 10th day of October 2007.
[00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:38.175]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:39.956]  Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America
[00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:08.166]  We'll be with us for an entire hour, coming up in the second hour, because I want to spend a lot of time on the subject he's going to be covering.
[00:01:11.628 --> 00:01:14.370]  How to actually defend the Second Amendment.
[00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:21.894]  How to save the Second Amendment, which is being ripped limb from limb as we speak.
[00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:27.857]  We're also going to talk about the history of the NRA.
[00:01:29.682 --> 00:01:32.965]  Now they wouldn't talk about the NRA and go after the NRA in the past.
[00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:53.101]  The NRA was not involved in quote defending gun rights until Gun Owners of America was founded and started lobbying in the early 1970s and then suddenly the NRA then had been a shooting club and a gun control group.
[00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:56.544]  That's right, a gun control group!
[00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.372]  Suddenly became our guardian, and it has 4 million members.
[00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:06.813]  Gun Owners of America has 150,000 members.
[00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:09.734]  Gun Owners is big.
[00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:21.179]  And if we can mobilize the 150,000 members of Gun Owners, and if we can increase the numbers of Gun Owners of America, this is a major chink in the armor of the New World Order that I see.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.203]  Now, people can take my advice for what it's worth, but I think if you research the data on this, you will find that I am correct.
[00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:34.929]  This is a major attack point that we need to use.
[00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.751]  That we need to exploit against the enemy.
[00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:41.614]  We can defeat the NRA.
[00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:44.675]  We can use their own documents, their own admissions.
[00:02:46.757 --> 00:02:49.899]  I have Larry up every few months and I had him on a week or so ago.
[00:02:51.795 --> 00:03:00.203]  But week before last, and I started attacking the NRA, and finally he went ahead and said what he knew, and of course knew more than I did about it, and started totally destroying them.
[00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:07.950]  And I talked to him, and their board has decided to go ahead and allow the truth to come out, because it's too desperate, the situation the Second Amendment's in.
[00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.893]  So gun owners are taking the gloves off, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:14.736]  They're taking the gloves off.
[00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:17.539]  The truth is absolutely horrible.
[00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:23.128]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:26.049]  We're not saying NRA members are bad.
[00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.350]  I'm a NRA member.
[00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:30.732]  Most of my family are members or lifetime members.
[00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:36.256]  I get the Rifleman Magazine.
[00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:41.959]  Driving around in high school, you know, I had the NRA sticker on my truck.
[00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.741]  The point is, if you can decide, what do you love more?
[00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:49.504]  The NRA and the Republican Party or the Second Amendment?
[00:03:49.544 --> 00:03:51.125]  You have to make a choice.
[00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.160]  You have to decide.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.641]  Do I want to save the Second Amendment?
[00:03:55.921 --> 00:03:58.023]  Do I want to stop losing ground every year?
[00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.366]  Or do I want to turn this around?
[00:04:02.427 --> 00:04:09.734]  The NRA authored the late 1960s Gun Control Act.
[00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:11.916]  1968 Gun Control Act.
[00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:13.698]  They authored the Brady Bill.
[00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.222]  They've authored this new bill that they're supporting
[00:04:18.897 --> 00:04:32.869]  That will ban many veterans from owning guns and even police officers if you have any type of psychological designation from ADHD when you were 12 years old to post-traumatic stress disorder from one of the Iraq wars, Vietnam, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:41.537]  And it's time to call a spade a spade, a club a club, a diamond a diamond, a heart a heart.
[00:04:42.057 --> 00:04:43.238]  It's time to be honest.
[00:04:43.258 --> 00:04:43.919]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:48.419]  Then we got Professor Francis Boyle, top bioweapons expert.
[00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:50.240]  Wrote some of the international treaties on it.
[00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:55.103]  To come into the show and talk about the New World Order, the war on Iran, the rest of it.
[00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:58.345]  Big broadcast lined up today.
[00:04:58.365 --> 00:04:58.966]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.061]  Terrorism!
[00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:02.961]  Terrorism!
[00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:09.126]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallouts, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:05:09.387 --> 00:05:10.988]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:13.710]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:28.662]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist with the U.S.
[00:05:28.702 --> 00:05:29.022]  government.
[00:05:29.202 --> 00:05:30.944]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:37.270]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.914]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:47.659]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:48.880]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.521]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:50.202]  Or order on the web
[00:06:03.758 --> 00:06:09.223]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:17.210]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:24.985]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:36.791]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.111 --> 00:06:40.673]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.054 --> 00:06:43.015]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.055 --> 00:06:47.197]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:07.909]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry and I'm a plastic surgeon and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.571]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:15.594]  It's called Night Skin and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels,
[00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:20.136]  In 12 hours, it will make your skin seem smoother.
[00:07:20.336 --> 00:07:22.797]  In 12 hours, it will stimulate collagen production.
[00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:26.398]  And in 12 hours, it will promote elastin growth in your skin.
[00:07:26.598 --> 00:07:27.378]  What does this all mean?
[00:07:27.618 --> 00:07:32.000]  Well, this is the stuff that makes your skin firm and healthy, and helps you look younger.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:41.423]  Night Skin is real, and the results are real, and it contains only proven ingredients that work to lighten age spots, smooth the skin, and help diminish the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:44.365]  It's easy, and in 12 hours, you'll see it works.
[00:07:44.585 --> 00:07:45.725]  Try it risk-free today.
[00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:46.366]  We're good to go.
[00:08:05.592 --> 00:08:09.793]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:11.254]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.014 --> 00:08:12.854]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:17.196]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.756 --> 00:08:21.877]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:28.280]  Well, it was a two-hour long debate on MSNBC.
[00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:32.169]  with ten candidates.
[00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:38.435]  Ron Paul was given the least amount of time, four and a half minutes.
[00:08:38.475 --> 00:08:43.380]  We have his entire talk time and we'll be playing that later in the third hour.
[00:08:45.262 --> 00:08:51.207]  Larry Pratt will be joining us in the second hour to discuss the history of gun control in this country.
[00:08:52.849 --> 00:08:54.891]  All verifiable for those that actually
[00:08:55.535 --> 00:09:00.976]  We want to save the Second Amendment and admit the Judas Code behavior of the NRA.
[00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:04.217]  Let's make it clear.
[00:09:04.257 --> 00:09:05.417]  It's not that they compromise.
[00:09:05.457 --> 00:09:07.097]  They are the authors of the gun control.
[00:09:07.157 --> 00:09:08.977]  They are where it flows from.
[00:09:10.558 --> 00:09:14.518]  And it'll take some deprogramming to wake conservatives up out there.
[00:09:14.558 --> 00:09:15.218]  This is the case.
[00:09:15.258 --> 00:09:18.439]  But that's coming up with Larry Pratt.
[00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:24.220]  And for the last 30 minutes of the transmission today, Professor Francis Boyle, who authored our Biological Weapons
[00:09:24.966 --> 00:09:27.688]  We're good to go.
[00:09:47.245 --> 00:09:50.726]  The torture and the war crimes, and exactly what it means.
[00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:59.789]  Remember, a week and a half ago, the New York Times reported, and the White House says that it's accurate, that Bush signed a secret executive order ordering the torture.
[00:10:00.849 --> 00:10:06.471]  But then they sent people to prison who followed the orders to engage in that torture.
[00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:08.071]  Just absolutely amazing.
[00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:11.552]  So we'll talk to that international law scholar about that today.
[00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:26.607]  In the meantime, I have this nice little stack of news here in front of me.
[00:10:28.547 --> 00:10:31.808]  Man cited for burning Mexican flag.
[00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:37.389]  Policeman threatened to arrest boy for toy gun.
[00:10:40.469 --> 00:10:43.470]  Another headline, police arrest boy for toy gun.
[00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:44.790]  U.S.
[00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.911]  and Afghan officials meet on aerial
[00:10:48.758 --> 00:11:01.146]  Opium spraying and Navy veteran questions why six nuclear missiles were flown on combat aircraft, the staging area for Middle East.
[00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:05.368]  This story's been big the last few months, but there's been some new wrinkles.
[00:11:05.408 --> 00:11:06.209]  We'll go over that.
[00:11:06.729 --> 00:11:09.391]  Court nixes suit claiming CIA torture.
[00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:13.753]  Justices throw out German's challenge to allege abduction by U.S.
[00:11:13.913 --> 00:11:14.634]  agents, AP.
[00:11:18.951 --> 00:11:27.655]  Police launch drug sweeps in schools and are forcing samples from the children.
[00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:31.476]  I mean, they're doing that now outside Denver on the side of the highway at random checkpoints.
[00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:31.937]  Why not?
[00:11:33.637 --> 00:11:37.319]  Police chiefs across the country are calling for putting cameras inside our homes.
[00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:39.600]  I mean, you couldn't make this stuff up.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.081]  I keep saying that because it's just, it's all insane.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.801]  Prosecutor caught in sexting died by hanging himself in the shower.
[00:11:48.821 --> 00:11:55.864]  Here's an interesting one out of the Minority Report or something.
[00:11:56.264 --> 00:12:01.905]  Dragonfly or insect spy, scientist at work on robo-bugs.
[00:12:02.606 --> 00:12:03.486]  Washington Post.
[00:12:04.238 --> 00:12:09.763]  Vanessa Alacron saw them while working at the anti-war rally in Lafayette Square last month.
[00:12:10.244 --> 00:12:12.926]  I heard someone say, oh my gosh, look at those.
[00:12:13.386 --> 00:12:18.311]  The college senior from New York recalled, I looked up and I'm like, what is that?
[00:12:18.691 --> 00:12:20.913]  They looked kind of like dragonflies.
[00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:23.776]  They're little helicopters, but I mean, those are not insects.
[00:12:24.528 --> 00:12:28.771]  Then it goes into the military with their little hover insect spies.
[00:12:29.372 --> 00:12:41.802]  It says they're growing real dragonflies with the bioengineered that then grow in and around the sensors that are bioengineered into them.
[00:12:42.903 --> 00:12:45.284]  Yeah, it's 2007, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:45.304 --> 00:12:47.286]  There's a lot of suppressed technology.
[00:12:47.386 --> 00:12:48.287]  They're now going to be having
[00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:54.452]  Externalization of the hierarchy or what I call thrilling it in your face.
[00:12:56.293 --> 00:12:59.514]  This is the Washington Post, Dragonfly, Spy Insects.
[00:13:00.435 --> 00:13:02.896]  They've got a picture of one there.
[00:13:03.056 --> 00:13:06.799]  You go to PrisonPlanet.com you can link over to the Washington Post and they have the photo there.
[00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:12.362]  Oh man, all over the country I see
[00:13:14.554 --> 00:13:21.742]  Sometimes 20-30 articles a day where they are announcing, oh, you know those traffic cameras or those pedestrian cameras?
[00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:23.224]  Oh, the feds put those in.
[00:13:23.244 --> 00:13:24.806]  We're going to use those to spy on you.
[00:13:24.866 --> 00:13:31.133]  And by the way, they're going to read your lips and listen to your audio and track everything with AI keyword computers.
[00:13:31.954 --> 00:13:32.334]  Here's one.
[00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:34.657]  Council locates surveillance cameras around city.
[00:13:36.804 --> 00:13:38.787]  Why prison stocks look tempting.
[00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:42.432]  That's the only real growth area in the economy is war and prisons.
[00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.275]  And it goes into all of it.
[00:13:44.715 --> 00:13:45.837]  Yeah, that's the new America.
[00:13:49.322 --> 00:13:52.166]  Got a bunch of other interesting stories here.
[00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:57.088]  I mentioned this Sunday, but now there have been new developments.
[00:13:57.468 --> 00:14:09.773]  Nigerian polio outbreak from vaccine, AP, a polio outbreak in Nigeria was caused by the vaccine designed to stop it, international health officials say, leaving at least 69 children paralyzed.
[00:14:10.734 --> 00:14:21.418]  And if you read World Health Organization and British psychological warfare documents that are public, they will generally give out a small number, when the number could be a thousand times that,
[00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:33.749]  And knowing that you will then psychologically have a internalized debate about the number instead of humanizing the children, and that you'll tend to average the number between the two numbers.
[00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.073]  I would guess it's much higher, but 69 paralyzed.
[00:14:38.024 --> 00:14:45.488]  It is a frightening paradox in a part of the world that already distrust Western vaccines, making it even tougher to stamp out the age-old disease.
[00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:55.294]  The outbreak was caused by the live poliovirus that was used in vaccines given orally, the preferred method in developed countries because it's cheaper and doesn't require medical training or to dispense.
[00:14:55.634 --> 00:14:58.816]  Now see, somebody reading that
[00:15:00.493 --> 00:15:12.104]  Wouldn't know that it has been illegal in the United States to give the oral vaccine since the 1970s, but it's still, quote, legal outside the U.S.
[00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:12.844]  Why is that?
[00:15:14.966 --> 00:15:17.669]  Most people have heard about SV40.
[00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.252]  Simian virus 40.
[00:15:22.013 --> 00:15:26.637]  There's actually hundreds of deadly cancer viruses, very virulent forms of cancer.
[00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:31.970]  In the different vaccines they've tested, not just polio or not just the live virus.
[00:15:34.793 --> 00:15:51.948]  And generally they of course bond into the DNA strands, they get into the tissues, and don't activate until your body has divided enough times, until your cells have replicated enough times, until your immune system gets broken down enough to where it stops fighting.
[00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:58.516]  So when you're exposed to this stuff, your immune system boosts.
[00:15:58.896 --> 00:16:01.298]  That's why allergies are so much worse globally.
[00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:11.087]  People a hundred years ago were around coal furnaces and sewage all over the streets and mercury and lead and arsenic and they got toxic from it.
[00:16:12.848 --> 00:16:21.276]  But they didn't get all of these allergies that we now see exploding and there's literally hundreds of studies and top scientists and medical doctors
[00:16:22.376 --> 00:16:40.005]  University showing that the genetically engineered food, the DNA fragments and toxins and poisons in the vaccines are stimulating a greater allergic response.
[00:16:40.325 --> 00:16:49.069]  We know that's why the first time you get bit by a bee, stung by a bee, you don't get sick.
[00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.132]  Or you don't swell up, but you get stung enough times you'll develop an allergy.
[00:16:53.592 --> 00:16:56.214]  See, that's why it's exploding and growing all over the world.
[00:16:57.655 --> 00:17:01.197]  It's a cocktail of reasons, but a big one is the vaccines.
[00:17:01.277 --> 00:17:08.041]  Your body is at a heightened level and is trying to fight everything off, so it starts just attacking everything.
[00:17:08.482 --> 00:17:11.243]  And then finally it just kind of wears out and gives up.
[00:17:11.283 --> 00:17:18.708]  It accelerates the aging process of your T lymphocytes and other warrior blood cells and
[00:17:21.638 --> 00:17:22.778]  Well, we're going to die, folks.
[00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:23.819]  A lot faster.
[00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:24.759]  I'll put it to you that way.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.601]  And I don't want to hear the false information that we live on longer.
[00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:29.621]  That is a complete lie.
[00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:36.684]  The statistics are true, but they are presented in a lie.
[00:17:38.405 --> 00:17:44.667]  Depending on which decade, and they did keep statistics in Europe, the U.S., Japan, you name it, going back 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000 years ago,
[00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:57.173]  Around 30%, some years it was worse, some years it was better, 30% of babies died within the first year.
[00:17:59.734 --> 00:18:02.055]  It went over 40% by the age of 10.
[00:18:05.616 --> 00:18:12.599]  Everybody knows children get sick a lot more, they haven't developed their immune systems yet, they get compromised, they die.
[00:18:15.424 --> 00:18:17.546]  And they also haven't developed wills to live.
[00:18:18.007 --> 00:18:18.948]  That's another big part of it.
[00:18:19.468 --> 00:18:20.289]  The studies show.
[00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:32.821]  And so, yes, if you've got 40% of people dying by the time they're 10 years old, 30% of that, or the lion's share of that, by the time they're 1, you ever gone to an old cemetery?
[00:18:33.182 --> 00:18:37.947]  We had an old family cemetery out in East Texas, and there's half of them in there were below the age of 2.
[00:18:44.577 --> 00:18:46.478]  A lot of them are a month old, six months old.
[00:18:46.498 --> 00:18:47.579]  You ever been to an old cemetery?
[00:18:47.879 --> 00:18:48.500]  Don't believe me?
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.501]  Just pull off the road at an old cemetery.
[00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:54.104]  A cemetery that's got 150, 160, 170 year old graves in it.
[00:18:54.124 --> 00:18:57.867]  There's gonna be babies everywhere.
[00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:59.348]  Okay?
[00:19:00.028 --> 00:19:07.533]  They average that number in, and then say, oh, people only lived an average of 57 in the Revolutionary War times.
[00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:10.335]  That's right.
[00:19:10.756 --> 00:19:11.817]  But if you live past 10,
[00:19:13.217 --> 00:19:18.079]  People routinely lived until they were 85, 90, 105 years old.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.860]  There were old people all over the place.
[00:19:21.941 --> 00:19:23.622]  If you lived, you lived.
[00:19:25.202 --> 00:19:29.384]  Russia's got a life expectancy right now of what, 55 for men?
[00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:30.965]  It's like 60 for women.
[00:19:32.745 --> 00:19:35.227]  Ours is 74 for men.
[00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:36.307]  What's 78 for women?
[00:19:38.768 --> 00:19:40.909]  You see, but the babies don't die now.
[00:19:46.744 --> 00:19:52.269]  Alright, I'm gonna get into a bunch of other news when we get back.
[00:19:52.309 --> 00:19:56.332]  It's just, you look at the statistics, we're not living as longer.
[00:19:57.073 --> 00:19:57.773]  They're killing us!
[00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:14.159]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:20.847]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:21.588]  I think so.
[00:20:42.537 --> 00:20:43.058]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:03.260]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:13.624]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[00:21:14.104 --> 00:21:19.646]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:22.567]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July.
[00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:28.890]  With falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone, could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:36.959]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:43.104]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle-class citizens and discouraging savings.
[00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:48.168]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[00:21:48.188 --> 00:21:51.151]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:53.133]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[00:21:53.193 --> 00:21:53.493]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[00:22:01.986 --> 00:22:04.428]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.068 --> 00:22:13.154]  Did you know that Senate committee investigations in the 1960s called the international communist movement the greatest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed?
[00:22:14.035 --> 00:22:21.240]  They said the communists had infiltrated into high government offices in the State Department and also advisors to presidents.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:29.884]  Did you know that the Communist infiltration successfully stopped all FBI investigations into their secret activities?
[00:22:30.444 --> 00:22:39.129]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:01.522 --> 00:23:03.604]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.225 --> 00:23:13.155]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:13.596 --> 00:23:20.804]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:21.514 --> 00:23:27.000]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:38.331]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:39.092 --> 00:23:41.094]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:41.634 --> 00:23:44.415]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:19.409]  By the way, we're only 16 days away from Endgame being released at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:30.877]  In 16 days, it will be posted in high quality Flash, Windows Media Player, and QuickTime.
[00:24:31.677 --> 00:24:33.619]  I mean, it looks almost as good as DVD.
[00:24:36.986 --> 00:24:41.068]  And then the info war can start.
[00:24:41.168 --> 00:24:45.871]  Because you can burn copies in high res.
[00:24:46.772 --> 00:24:57.958]  And every one you give to somebody is another nail in the coffin of the New World Order.
[00:24:58.398 --> 00:25:02.701]  Every one is a bullet fired right into the heart of the globalists.
[00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:12.906]  Endgame October 26 hits the web!
[00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:19.610]  And within a day or two of that, I've got them right now.
[00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:24.592]  We're gonna start shipping it out to you en masse.
[00:25:26.013 --> 00:25:29.375]  With super high quality digital DVDs.
[00:25:30.475 --> 00:25:31.096]  Weapons!
[00:25:38.386 --> 00:25:41.089]  This film will hurt the New World Order grievously.
[00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.613]  And that's exactly what I intend to do!
[00:25:46.815 --> 00:25:56.185]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play... Vicente Fox.
[00:25:56.225 --> 00:26:00.129]  You know, a lot of times, a blind hog like myself...
[00:26:01.195 --> 00:26:12.288]  We'll find a little acorn and think I found quite a meal in the Info War when a big old juicy granddaddy acorn was right beneath my snout as I rooted about on the forest floor.
[00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.312]  We, of course, broke here with Dr. Corsi.
[00:26:15.332 --> 00:26:16.614]  We appreciate him breaking in here.
[00:26:17.307 --> 00:26:18.908]  And by breaking it, he pointed it out.
[00:26:19.368 --> 00:26:25.130]  Vicente Fox on Larry King Live two nights ago saying we're going to create an Amero dollar, a European Union.
[00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:29.432]  Now we have that in the documents, in the books, in the secret treaties that are now declassified.
[00:26:29.812 --> 00:26:31.132]  The public will not believe us.
[00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:32.013]  They will not read it.
[00:26:32.513 --> 00:26:33.473]  They will not look at it.
[00:26:33.513 --> 00:26:34.373]  They will not read.
[00:26:34.914 --> 00:26:41.496]  They willfully will thump their chest and neocon about and hop around and giggle and snicker, as they've been trained to do as slaves.
[00:26:43.197 --> 00:26:46.378]  But they cannot debate Vicente Fox saying
[00:26:47.159 --> 00:26:51.783]  And we can circulate the video clip that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:26:52.123 --> 00:26:53.625]  We can force people to look at it.
[00:26:53.665 --> 00:26:55.206]  You can pull it up at lunch at work.
[00:26:55.827 --> 00:26:57.108]  Don't do it on The Boss this time.
[00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:59.650]  At lunch, say, hey, Walter or hey, Bill.
[00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.612]  You know, you're saying there's no NAU, there's no North American Union.
[00:27:02.833 --> 00:27:04.734]  Here's Vicente Fox on Larry King Live.
[00:27:06.175 --> 00:27:12.000]  But he says it quick and they'll probably just giggle and snicker and bring up their favorite sports team.
[00:27:12.341 --> 00:27:14.663]  But you can go watch this.
[00:27:15.658 --> 00:27:26.247]  He said a lot more the same day, two days ago, Monday, on The Daily Show with Stewart.
[00:27:28.249 --> 00:27:34.274]  And so, we're going to be playing that coming up in the next segment.
[00:27:34.754 --> 00:27:36.216]  And Paul Watson's in another article.
[00:27:36.236 --> 00:27:38.778]  You know, Paul, actually Aaron found it and sent it to Paul.
[00:27:38.798 --> 00:27:40.099]  I never watched it until this morning.
[00:27:40.965 --> 00:27:45.848]  And Paul, just as a footnote, in the article we wrote, Roland Ailey didn't even learn about it, said, uh, oh!
[00:27:48.589 --> 00:27:50.550]  Look, he said the same thing on the Daily Show!
[00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.191]  No, he didn't.
[00:27:51.231 --> 00:27:52.091]  He said a lot more.
[00:27:52.131 --> 00:27:53.372]  He said North American Union.
[00:27:54.472 --> 00:27:55.693]  He came right out with it.
[00:27:58.134 --> 00:27:59.135]  So, this is big.
[00:27:59.415 --> 00:28:02.257]  This is a lot bigger than the Larry King Live statement.
[00:28:03.117 --> 00:28:04.518]  And it's up to us to
[00:28:05.914 --> 00:28:12.758]  Get this out to people, because there is, I mean really, yesterday I was so angry and so mad, plus I've got horrible ragweed allergies right now.
[00:28:13.698 --> 00:28:24.464]  And I'm not whining about it, I don't want you to, oh Alex, we're sorry, you're sick, it's just if you hear me pausing, or hear me stumbling around, or I start getting angry on air, it's because I literally feel like I had the flu since last Thursday, and I don't like this.
[00:28:27.246 --> 00:28:32.849]  I may even leave town this weekend, just to get, literally just drive away from here, and get into some other allergy zone.
[00:28:33.886 --> 00:28:37.289]  Because I can literally leave town when I have allergies and feel good a day later.
[00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.872]  I don't know how much better East Texas will be though.
[00:28:41.892 --> 00:28:44.194]  See allergies come on with just sneezing and runny nose.
[00:28:44.574 --> 00:28:47.656]  So I'll go to East Texas and just have that with whatever horrible stuff they've got there.
[00:28:48.237 --> 00:28:50.398]  And a week later I get the flu symptoms.
[00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:55.302]  So I guess I can run from place to place to try to
[00:28:57.426 --> 00:29:02.690]  What happens is I put out a lot of energy on three hours of the show, and then I'm just a basket case after the show.
[00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:07.033]  I'm literally just sitting there in my chair like I've been... And I don't like the medicines.
[00:29:07.754 --> 00:29:08.294]  They don't do anything.
[00:29:08.314 --> 00:29:10.536]  They just make you more wide awake when you feel like trash.
[00:29:11.177 --> 00:29:12.097]  I'm already digressing.
[00:29:12.237 --> 00:29:14.219]  And I've read all the studies and the medical reports.
[00:29:14.259 --> 00:29:14.920]  I know what it is.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.601]  It's the toxins in the air.
[00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.182]  It's the genetically modified foods.
[00:29:18.242 --> 00:29:19.803]  It's the vaccines we took as children.
[00:29:20.564 --> 00:29:23.426]  They all screw up our immune system, so it starts alerting.
[00:29:23.446 --> 00:29:24.467]  That's what poison ivy is.
[00:29:25.228 --> 00:29:28.530]  Poison ivy doesn't make you have the... make you have the whelps.
[00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.892]  Your body reacts in an autoimmune response.
[00:29:32.373 --> 00:29:34.094]  And I've just got inflammation of the brain.
[00:29:34.774 --> 00:29:35.955]  And inflammation of the sinus.
[00:29:37.836 --> 00:29:45.261]  My head all swells up like a... I'll come back with the Vicente Fox and a lot more.
[00:29:45.301 --> 00:29:45.781]  Stay with me.
[00:29:51.445 --> 00:29:52.486]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.846 --> 00:29:54.347]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.346 --> 00:29:58.036]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.577 --> 00:30:03.398]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:30:03.539 --> 00:30:08.722]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:30:08.902 --> 00:30:10.243]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:30:10.524 --> 00:30:18.690]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:24.694]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:30:24.814 --> 00:30:26.575]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:30:26.675 --> 00:30:28.757]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:30:28.937 --> 00:30:33.203]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:30:33.343 --> 00:30:35.506]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:30:35.586 --> 00:30:43.376]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:30:43.817 --> 00:30:44.358]  We're good to go.
[00:31:01.249 --> 00:31:04.190]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:09.571]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:31:09.871 --> 00:31:15.172]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:31:15.572 --> 00:31:16.713]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:17.053 --> 00:31:25.975]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:31:26.275 --> 00:31:26.355]  Yes!
[00:31:26.375 --> 00:31:27.976]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.

[00:32:01.761 --> 00:32:03.702]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[00:32:04.142 --> 00:32:04.403]  Look!
[00:32:04.823 --> 00:32:05.884]  Up there in the sky!
[00:32:06.284 --> 00:32:07.584]  It's Non-X-Man!
[00:32:07.604 --> 00:32:09.185]  He's in a dive!
[00:32:09.446 --> 00:32:11.447]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[00:32:11.747 --> 00:32:12.507]  Let's go look!
[00:32:14.749 --> 00:32:17.930]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel!
[00:32:18.331 --> 00:32:19.691]  Stop hiding them in the sand!
[00:32:19.892 --> 00:32:20.312]  Take them out!
[00:32:20.965 --> 00:32:21.646]  Let's see.
[00:32:21.666 --> 00:32:26.171]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:32:26.191 --> 00:32:27.072]  Don't worry.
[00:32:27.513 --> 00:32:29.034]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:32:29.655 --> 00:32:34.080]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.683]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[00:32:36.803 --> 00:32:39.506]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[00:32:41.608 --> 00:32:44.270]  Don't let Nonnox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.252]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonnox Nail Gel.
[00:32:48.732 --> 00:32:59.938]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[00:32:59.958 --> 00:33:03.319]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.940]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.341]  It's a depression.
[00:33:07.501 --> 00:33:10.383]  Everybody's out of work, or scared of losing their job.
[00:33:11.792 --> 00:33:13.333]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[00:33:13.793 --> 00:33:14.813]  Banks are going bust.
[00:33:14.873 --> 00:33:16.814]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[00:33:17.434 --> 00:33:19.035]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[00:33:19.075 --> 00:33:21.656]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[00:33:23.256 --> 00:33:23.677]  We know.
[00:33:24.117 --> 00:33:25.657]  The air is unfit to breathe.
[00:33:25.797 --> 00:33:27.178]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[00:33:28.018 --> 00:33:36.504]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[00:33:36.784 --> 00:33:38.845]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[00:33:39.446 --> 00:33:40.186]  They're crazy.
[00:33:40.386 --> 00:33:43.408]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:50.713]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[00:33:50.753 --> 00:33:55.116]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[00:33:55.316 --> 00:33:56.137]  Just leave us alone.
[00:33:56.377 --> 00:33:57.718]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[00:33:58.599 --> 00:33:59.739]  I want you to get mad!
[00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:01.861]  I don't want you to protest.
[00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:03.002]  I don't want you to riot.
[00:34:03.022 --> 00:34:05.964]  I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[00:34:06.345 --> 00:34:10.648]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[00:34:10.968 --> 00:34:13.490]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:15.852]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[00:34:16.092 --> 00:34:17.293]  My life has value!
[00:34:18.894 --> 00:34:19.315]  I want you...
[00:34:20.245 --> 00:34:21.565]  To get up now.
[00:34:22.346 --> 00:34:24.366]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[00:34:24.386 --> 00:34:36.130]  I want you to get up right now, and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:38.750]  I want you to get up right now.
[00:34:39.471 --> 00:34:43.832]  Get up, go to your windows, open them, and stick your head out and yell,
[00:34:46.358 --> 00:34:49.942]  I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:02.173]  I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:35:04.575 --> 00:35:09.520]  Welcome back to the front lines of the Infowar!
[00:35:16.994 --> 00:35:18.735]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:18.995 --> 00:35:21.057]  We're committed to defending the Republic.
[00:35:22.298 --> 00:35:33.205]  We are committed to resisting the tyrannical overlord of this global crime syndicate that is waging war on free humanity.
[00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:43.932]  I salute every man, woman, and child of you out there who loves liberty, who has passion for freedom,
[00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:52.596]  Who hates bullies and despotism and fraud and lies.
[00:35:54.158 --> 00:36:02.265]  I salute all of you that are standing in the gaps with me against the threat to our species.
[00:36:03.906 --> 00:36:12.054]  I salute all of you who love God and love righteousness and who have faith that evil
[00:36:13.217 --> 00:36:18.041]  In the end, we'll be bound, we'll be cast down!
[00:36:21.284 --> 00:36:23.605]  Alright, coming up, Vicente Fox.
[00:36:25.107 --> 00:36:30.811]  Unbelievable revelation to the general public on The Daily Show.
[00:36:30.951 --> 00:36:35.535]  Far more powerful than Larry King Live, but I want to start out with that Larry King Live clip first.
[00:36:35.615 --> 00:36:36.416]  Before we do that,
[00:36:37.105 --> 00:36:38.906]  We haven't had her or Adam on in about a month.
[00:36:38.966 --> 00:36:43.589]  Everybody's been so busy, and they've been so busy, they have never had more orders coming in.
[00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:48.573]  They're the big national manufacturer, the American Berkey, the national distributor, the British Birkfeld.
[00:36:48.593 --> 00:36:52.475]  That means you get distributor prices when you just buy one.
[00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:53.796]  Literally.
[00:36:54.016 --> 00:36:56.218]  You buy one, and a $209 unit is, you know, would be $320.
[00:37:00.669 --> 00:37:05.494]  And they've got sports bottles that just make the water safe to drink, where you get five for $100.
[00:37:06.294 --> 00:37:10.618]  One of these is like $35, $40 in a camping store, so you're talking about half off.
[00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:15.843]  They have got so many deals, and the American Berkey is the highest standard.
[00:37:15.863 --> 00:37:16.724]  We use it in the office.
[00:37:17.044 --> 00:37:17.865]  We use it at home.
[00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:21.629]  I give it to family as gifts every holiday season.
[00:37:22.149 --> 00:37:23.731]  Now is the time.
[00:37:24.668 --> 00:37:25.789]  To take control of your life.
[00:37:25.929 --> 00:37:27.250]  Stop using cell phones.
[00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.450]  At least have a hands-free.
[00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.531]  And I'm talking to myself, too.
[00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:31.332]  I constantly lose the hands-free.
[00:37:31.732 --> 00:37:33.854]  I got trained years ago to not use a hands-free.
[00:37:34.714 --> 00:37:35.475]  Brain tumors.
[00:37:36.055 --> 00:37:36.796]  Huge news.
[00:37:36.936 --> 00:37:37.596]  Documented.
[00:37:37.776 --> 00:37:38.196]  No doubt.
[00:37:39.497 --> 00:37:43.860]  Any denial of it is like the cigarette companies claiming it doesn't give you lung cancer.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.541]  I mean, they just testified last year it doesn't.
[00:37:45.741 --> 00:37:46.261]  Total lie.
[00:37:47.442 --> 00:37:48.083]  The water.
[00:37:48.223 --> 00:37:50.024]  We are being poisoned by design.
[00:37:50.124 --> 00:37:51.845]  And then there's all the runoff on top of it.
[00:37:53.303 --> 00:38:01.747]  I mean, if you live up near the Arctic Circle, or up where the rivers start, or you live on the Great Divide, the water's probably safe to drink if you're getting it right off a mountaintop.
[00:38:03.809 --> 00:38:05.069]  But still, there's stuff in the rain.
[00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.131]  But you're drinking something down on the coast.
[00:38:08.151 --> 00:38:12.733]  You're drinking something that's been coming off rivers that have gone through 10, 15 cities, 100 towns.
[00:38:12.833 --> 00:38:15.254]  I mean, you're drinking thousands of things.
[00:38:15.274 --> 00:38:19.977]  You ought to go to the EPA website, and you ought to read the thousands of things they allow in the water.
[00:38:21.144 --> 00:38:31.012]  Every major city has high levels of Prozac, Ritalin, Mercury, Arsenic, Sodium and Stannous Fluoride in there by design.
[00:38:31.292 --> 00:38:37.176]  A Nazi chemical weapon in Pulitzer Prize winning books on World War II using it in the camps.
[00:38:37.216 --> 00:38:39.798]  You can't... I didn't believe that ten years ago when I first heard that.
[00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:42.120]  I went and looked the books up and it was there.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.501]  I literally almost fell down.
[00:38:44.122 --> 00:38:48.745]  I mean, we're under massive attack and we're going to have to admit it.
[00:38:48.805 --> 00:38:49.706]  And let me tell you something.
[00:38:51.181 --> 00:38:55.985]  Look, you can't go buy a $20 or $50 charcoal filter at the store.
[00:38:56.185 --> 00:38:57.927]  That's going to cut out some dead bacteria.
[00:38:57.947 --> 00:39:01.289]  Because remember, the chlorine just kills the bacteria and you're still drinking the dead ones.
[00:39:01.329 --> 00:39:02.891]  So it's the equivalent of drinking rotten meat.
[00:39:03.771 --> 00:39:05.913]  And there's a lot of studies on all the toxins that build up in there.
[00:39:05.933 --> 00:39:06.834]  That's really bad for you.
[00:39:07.354 --> 00:39:08.655]  That's one of the thousands of things.
[00:39:09.316 --> 00:39:10.717]  But at least that's better than nothing.
[00:39:11.618 --> 00:39:14.260]  But if you get a high quality filtration system,
[00:39:15.214 --> 00:39:18.575]  I mean, one that's comparable to these systems would cost thousands of dollars.
[00:39:18.975 --> 00:39:20.035]  And then you gotta upkeep it.
[00:39:20.115 --> 00:39:21.935]  This is what the missionaries go with.
[00:39:22.276 --> 00:39:23.856]  This is what the military goes with.
[00:39:25.656 --> 00:39:27.757]  But regardless, just get water filtration.
[00:39:28.177 --> 00:39:29.357]  Stop using cell phones.
[00:39:29.417 --> 00:39:30.677]  Stop taking vaccines.
[00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:33.098]  I'm telling you, there's no doubt, it's bad.
[00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:36.339]  I got mainstream scientific studies.
[00:39:36.879 --> 00:39:39.519]  One of them was between, what, it said 14 universities?
[00:39:40.439 --> 00:39:42.800]  Another study just came out off of four other studies?
[00:39:43.974 --> 00:39:48.796]  Showing that it's causing massive increases in brain tumors right where you use the cell phone.
[00:39:48.856 --> 00:39:51.338]  I mean, folks, this is not debatable.
[00:39:51.678 --> 00:39:52.478]  This is a fact.
[00:39:53.279 --> 00:40:03.283]  If you don't filter your water and put a shower filter on, because that's where a lot of this stuff comes in, you breathe it and it goes through your skin, you're nuts.
[00:40:04.104 --> 00:40:04.724]  You're nuts.
[00:40:06.229 --> 00:40:08.210]  Alright, Debbie, I know you're holding and I've got a lot of stuff to get to.
[00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.091]  I appreciate you coming on.
[00:40:09.471 --> 00:40:11.692]  But really, this stuff should sell itself.
[00:40:12.533 --> 00:40:15.454]  And if they don't get it from you, they ought to get it somewhere else.
[00:40:15.494 --> 00:40:17.235]  But all I know is I've vetted you guys.
[00:40:17.535 --> 00:40:21.297]  You guys became sponsors because I bought filters from you in like 1998.
[00:40:21.718 --> 00:40:24.739]  I mean, I get the sponsors that I use.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.981]  And I don't know what else to say.
[00:40:28.021 --> 00:40:29.322]  They're insane if they don't call you.
[00:40:30.675 --> 00:40:34.486]  Alex, I couldn't agree with you more and it's very nice to talk to you.
[00:40:34.586 --> 00:40:36.190]  Thank you very much for having me.
[00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:36.952]  Thanks for coming on.
[00:40:37.906 --> 00:40:42.308]  Our lines are open and we're expecting lots of calls from your listeners.
[00:40:42.708 --> 00:40:52.132]  Not only do they get really good deals on Berkey water filter systems and free gifts, but it also helps support your international shortwave airtime.
[00:40:52.893 --> 00:40:59.756]  And so I just wanted to come on and just thank you for allowing us to help support your programming.
[00:41:00.826 --> 00:41:01.307]  That's about it.
[00:41:01.327 --> 00:41:03.129]  I'll look forward to hearing from your customers.
[00:41:03.509 --> 00:41:06.452]  Well, now, also, my free gift.
[00:41:06.492 --> 00:41:15.181]  I mean, you get a really nice sports bottle that makes water safe to drink 116 times out of swamp water, 630-something times out of tap water.
[00:41:15.801 --> 00:41:16.962]  That just makes it safe.
[00:41:17.022 --> 00:41:17.723]  It reduces.
[00:41:17.803 --> 00:41:20.946]  It's great to give your children at school or to go to work or to the gym.
[00:41:20.986 --> 00:41:21.907]  That's what we use them for.
[00:41:22.227 --> 00:41:24.550]  That's different from the big purification systems.
[00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:26.570]  Absolutely, it sure is.
[00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:31.652]  It has the same type of filter in it, does just about the same kind of cleaning.
[00:41:32.092 --> 00:41:35.633]  A lot of customers ask me if they take out fluoride, and no they do not.
[00:41:36.073 --> 00:41:38.993]  The Berkey Sport bottles do not take out fluoride.
[00:41:39.474 --> 00:41:45.195]  And also, for those listeners in California, they have started putting that fluoride in their water now.
[00:41:45.994 --> 00:41:53.980]  And so we need to get those customers who have burkeys to call us and get the fluoride reduction filters to add to their systems.
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.843]  Or if they don't have a system, they need to give us a call so we can get those systems into their homes.
[00:41:59.023 --> 00:42:01.005]  Yeah, fluoride is such a tiny particle.
[00:42:01.025 --> 00:42:03.867]  It just goes through everything.
[00:42:07.137 --> 00:42:07.577]  888-803-4438.
[00:42:08.017 --> 00:42:08.877]  Debbie, God bless you.
[00:42:09.097 --> 00:42:10.018]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:42:10.118 --> 00:42:12.058]  It was very nice talking to you yesterday.
[00:42:12.478 --> 00:42:13.439]  Hey, it was great talking to you.
[00:42:13.479 --> 00:42:14.639]  Say hi to your husband and family.
[00:42:14.839 --> 00:42:15.339]  Thank you.
[00:42:15.379 --> 00:42:15.759]  Bye-bye.
[00:42:16.239 --> 00:42:17.560]  There goes Debbie up in Dallas.
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.780]  888-803-4438.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:25.482]  Or you can order all the exact same systems and we just fax in the orders every day at InfoWars.com.
[00:42:25.502 --> 00:42:28.963]  You can order them at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-803-4438.
[00:42:32.524 --> 00:42:38.206]  You can get a free sports bottle when you buy the larger unit, a free sheltering in place DVD, whatever.
[00:42:38.226 --> 00:42:44.768]  888-803-4438 in the comment section of InfoWars.com, you know, on the order form.
[00:42:44.868 --> 00:42:46.908]  Tell us what free gift you want, we have them listed there.
[00:42:47.849 --> 00:42:54.590]  And again, you're getting like a $320 unit at a store, at a camping supply place that they bought from these guys for $210.
[00:42:56.849 --> 00:42:58.830]  You're getting a $270 unit for $270 that would be $400.
[00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:02.252]  You're getting a $20 sports bottle that would be $35-$40 at a store.
[00:43:02.272 --> 00:43:02.312]  888-803-4438.
[00:43:02.332 --> 00:43:02.372]  888-803-4438.
[00:43:02.392 --> 00:43:06.215]  And again, I can't believe Monday we put a story out about Congressman Ron Paul here on the show.
[00:43:26.531 --> 00:43:26.891]  Friday.
[00:43:26.911 --> 00:43:29.754]  I said, how far could the dollar go down?
[00:43:30.434 --> 00:43:31.735]  And I thought he'd say, well, another 30%.
[00:43:31.795 --> 00:43:35.418]  He said, well, it could, in the next couple of years, it could go down 100%.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:50.390]  But if you look at Germany, and if you look at Argentina, and you look at other countries, about half the time when there's a currency crash, it will go down 100%, 99%, and then they scrap it.
[00:43:52.151 --> 00:43:54.453]  So actually, the doctor's right.
[00:43:55.248 --> 00:43:56.969]  We've got a good chance.
[00:43:56.989 --> 00:43:59.070]  50-50, really.
[00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.351]  If it continues to plunge, it'll go down to zero.
[00:44:04.793 --> 00:44:11.996]  And I saw people on our message board and on the dig board with the story Monday, and then I looked at it again last night, going, I'm a liar.
[00:44:12.296 --> 00:44:13.357]  The economy's great.
[00:44:13.377 --> 00:44:14.757]  The dollar's doing good.
[00:44:14.777 --> 00:44:16.818]  Ron Paul's a scaremonger.
[00:44:16.878 --> 00:44:18.319]  I mean, what's wrong with you people?
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.561]  It's lost 62% of its value.
[00:44:22.261 --> 00:44:23.542]  It's unbelievable.
[00:44:24.142 --> 00:44:24.362]  I mean,
[00:44:25.465 --> 00:44:27.327]  Every time I think about it, I get upset!
[00:44:29.969 --> 00:44:32.872]  And they'll just say, hey, the stock market's at $14,000, pal.
[00:44:34.854 --> 00:44:43.462]  Yeah, with a 60-plus percent devalued dollar versus the euro in seven years, you're going to have it at $14,000.
[00:44:43.502 --> 00:44:43.923]  What is 62%
[00:44:50.299 --> 00:44:51.399]  Minus out of 14,000.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.200]  I don't have a calculator in front of me.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.260]  My computer broke a few days ago in my office.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.160]  I've got to get another one in here.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:57.981]  It's getting repaired.
[00:44:59.281 --> 00:45:00.221]  Do a calculator.
[00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:00.441]  Divide out.
[00:45:00.461 --> 00:45:00.921]  What is 62% out of 14,000?
[00:45:01.461 --> 00:45:02.882]  John, you got a calculator there at the studios?
[00:45:02.922 --> 00:45:03.482]  Yeah, what's 62% minus?
[00:45:03.502 --> 00:45:06.282]  Divide it out of 14,000.
[00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:28.244]  I guess that would be the stock market at like $6,800?
[00:45:28.284 --> 00:45:28.244]  $7,000?
[00:45:30.765 --> 00:45:34.766]  No, that's not right.
[00:45:35.887 --> 00:45:38.908]  Yeah, because you're taking 62% out.
[00:45:38.948 --> 00:45:39.808]  I don't know.
[00:45:41.128 --> 00:45:42.809]  I could pause and hand write it out here.
[00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:44.510]  It doesn't matter.
[00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:45.830]  We're all public school educated.
[00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.111]  Pretty soon we won't even be able to talk.
[00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:48.491]  I can't do it either, John.
[00:45:52.754 --> 00:45:55.015]  We're talking about 6,000 plus percent.
[00:45:55.876 --> 00:45:59.877]  I mean, that's what your stock market is at right now.
[00:46:02.799 --> 00:46:05.400]  And so, we're in deep trouble.
[00:46:07.081 --> 00:46:15.605]  And again, the deflating dollar, it's buying power being deflated, it's being inflated,
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:22.003]  And they go on the news and they say everywhere it's because the precious illegal aliens have been deported.
[00:46:22.223 --> 00:46:23.944]  A. The illegal aliens have not been deported.
[00:46:23.964 --> 00:46:27.547]  33,000 out of 30 million.
[00:46:28.347 --> 00:46:30.028]  3 million illegals a year piling up.
[00:46:30.389 --> 00:46:32.630]  That 30,000 isn't even a drop in the bucket.
[00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:34.592]  It's a lie.
[00:46:35.452 --> 00:46:36.133]  They don't care.
[00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:38.134]  They never care.
[00:46:38.817 --> 00:46:44.899]  And sure enough, on talk radio yesterday, I heard them all parroting, we gotta keep the illegals here, see the prices are going up.
[00:46:45.259 --> 00:46:51.440]  I mean, the bankers do this to us, and as usual, they spin it, and the dumb public just buys it!
[00:46:53.601 --> 00:47:00.383]  Alright, here's Fox on CNN, two nights ago, talking about the North American Union, talking about the Amero currency, here it is.
[00:47:01.954 --> 00:47:06.057]  Do you fear that part of the legal immigration problem is terrorism?
[00:47:07.238 --> 00:47:07.598]  Uh, no.
[00:47:08.259 --> 00:47:08.719]  Not at all.
[00:47:08.779 --> 00:47:10.280]  It's a totally different business.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.621]  Absolutely different.
[00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:13.722]  You don't equate it to?
[00:47:13.942 --> 00:47:14.643]  Absolutely not.
[00:47:15.203 --> 00:47:18.085]  Email from Mrs. Gonzalez in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
[00:47:18.225 --> 00:47:24.390]  Mr. Fox, I'd like to know how you feel about the possibility of having a Latin America united with one currency.
[00:47:25.845 --> 00:47:27.426]  Long term, very long term.
[00:47:27.506 --> 00:47:35.069]  What we proposed together, President Bush and myself, is ALCA, which is a trade union for all of the Americas.
[00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.872]  And everything was running fluently until Hugo Chavez came.
[00:47:40.052 --> 00:47:42.593]  And he decided to isolate himself.
[00:47:43.133 --> 00:47:47.175]  He decided to combat the idea and destroy the idea.
[00:47:47.295 --> 00:47:49.476]  And very unfortunately... You mean like the Eurodollar, you mean?
[00:47:50.156 --> 00:47:51.677]  Well, that would be long, long term.
[00:47:52.478 --> 00:48:02.024]  I think the process is to go first step into a trading agreement and then further on a new vision like we're trying to do with NAFTA.
[00:48:03.885 --> 00:48:05.286]  Now let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[00:48:05.306 --> 00:48:06.827]  We'll go into break and come back and finish it up.
[00:48:06.847 --> 00:48:08.568]  This is the Daily Show the same day Monday.
[00:48:08.608 --> 00:48:08.948]  Here it is.
[00:48:09.489 --> 00:48:15.773]  Ride all the way down to Guanajuato and looking for his American dream without a penny in his pocket.
[00:48:16.013 --> 00:48:17.854]  He made his dream in Mexico.
[00:48:18.494 --> 00:48:20.756]  So migration is a two-way street.
[00:48:21.437 --> 00:48:22.697]  Can I tell you this?
[00:48:23.217 --> 00:48:26.938]  Cincinnati has gone hugely downhill since then.
[00:48:27.018 --> 00:48:30.079]  I can't even... I don't even want to talk about it.
[00:48:30.199 --> 00:48:32.479]  If I were you, I'd saddle up and come back.
[00:48:32.839 --> 00:48:33.239]  Help us!
[00:48:33.259 --> 00:48:33.859]  Help us!
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:42.841]  Do you feel that because of September 11th, we're overreacting to the border situation there?
[00:48:43.301 --> 00:48:48.242]  Yeah, it's my impression that fear is guiding public opinion here.
[00:48:48.942 --> 00:48:49.862]  And xenophobic...
[00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:53.261]  What if we build
[00:49:18.524 --> 00:49:21.309]  The fence, and have the nice part facing Mexico.
[00:49:21.469 --> 00:49:21.970]  The pretty part.
[00:49:23.622 --> 00:49:29.406]  Why did we build a fence and not let in products that come from the States to Mexico?
[00:49:30.026 --> 00:49:33.028]  Worth over 200 billion US dollars.
[00:49:33.409 --> 00:49:36.471]  Worth many, many jobs to this nation right here.
[00:49:36.711 --> 00:49:38.472]  So you're saying it's your way to treat the globalization.
[00:49:38.752 --> 00:49:39.693]  You're for NAFTA then.
[00:49:40.093 --> 00:49:41.894]  Has NAFTA helped Mexico?
[00:49:41.914 --> 00:49:42.755]  Absolutely, yes.
[00:49:42.835 --> 00:49:44.496]  Seven largest trade balance.
[00:49:44.736 --> 00:49:47.138]  Larger than all of Latin America together.
[00:49:47.838 --> 00:49:50.180]  And yes, NAFTA has been good.
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.421]  As a matter of fact, we should have a new vision.
[00:49:52.461 --> 00:49:53.102]  Go further.
[00:49:53.775 --> 00:49:57.117]  Integrating and working together to build a better future for both.
[00:49:57.197 --> 00:50:03.641]  How high, if the standard of living in Mexico, because people still come over because they can get better jobs and things.
[00:50:04.002 --> 00:50:04.842]  How long would it take?
[00:50:04.882 --> 00:50:11.746]  How high would the standard have to go before you think the tide starts to settle and shifts?
[00:50:11.847 --> 00:50:15.489]  We're at 8,000 right now, 8,000 US dollars per capita a year.
[00:50:15.509 --> 00:50:18.691]  I think it should go all the way up to over 20.
[00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:21.933]  And that happened with Spain, with the European Union.
[00:50:22.603 --> 00:50:25.625]  This is total bull, all of it is total propaganda.
[00:50:25.665 --> 00:50:27.607]  Ireland refused to join the EU.
[00:50:51.784 --> 00:50:53.665]  And slash their taxes from 70% to 10%.
[00:50:55.546 --> 00:50:57.827]  You are a congenital liar, Fox!
[00:51:04.451 --> 00:51:07.633]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.953 --> 00:51:09.894]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.274 --> 00:51:17.858]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.587 --> 00:51:25.671]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.051 --> 00:51:37.457]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.777 --> 00:51:41.459]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.701]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.021 --> 00:51:47.863]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.374 --> 00:52:02.155]  Terrorism!
[00:52:02.295 --> 00:52:03.035]  Terrorism!
[00:52:03.135 --> 00:52:09.219]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:11.040]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.782]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:14.162 --> 00:52:28.731]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:28.771 --> 00:52:29.111]  government.
[00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:31.012]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:52:31.432 --> 00:52:37.354]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:37.494 --> 00:52:41.975]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:54:01.283 --> 00:54:03.704]  I don't know what to say about all the lies of Vicente Fox.
[00:54:03.724 --> 00:54:05.044]  My guesstimation was correct.
[00:54:05.064 --> 00:54:05.504]  I said, what, 6,700?
[00:54:05.544 --> 00:54:08.586]  That's what I calculated in my brain, and we did calculate it.
[00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:28.511]  The stock market averaging down was at $14,000 right now.
[00:54:29.672 --> 00:54:30.792]  It's that and some change.
[00:54:33.014 --> 00:54:39.719]  Then we're talking about the stock market at 2,000 levels being at $6,720.
[00:54:39.759 --> 00:54:41.600]  So with dollar value, the stock market is at $6,720.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:45.463]  They talk about Google stock getting close to $700.
[00:54:54.698 --> 00:54:55.098]  A share.
[00:54:55.939 --> 00:55:03.502]  Okay, well that's really 300 and something dollars a share.
[00:55:05.002 --> 00:55:05.843]  See, when I hit 700, 350.
[00:55:05.983 --> 00:55:11.725]  I don't know how, I mean this is basic, basic, basic stuff.
[00:55:13.246 --> 00:55:17.287]  And people are just now starting to, I'm starting to hear a little bit of talk about currency.
[00:55:24.068 --> 00:55:24.668]  It's amazing.
[00:55:25.169 --> 00:55:26.229]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:55:26.529 --> 00:55:33.693]  They'll probably pass some tariff on China of a half a percentage point that does nothing, and then totally plunge the economy, and then claim that did it.
[00:55:33.713 --> 00:55:34.634]  I mean, that's how they do it.
[00:55:34.674 --> 00:55:37.255]  Or, oh, it's the subprime mortgages they're causing it all.
[00:55:37.535 --> 00:55:44.699]  Just as we predicted, they used some financial creation of their own that's a very small piece of this to blame it on it, and that's what they're blaming everything on right now.
[00:55:45.219 --> 00:55:47.241]  No, the international banks issued all this credit.
[00:55:47.801 --> 00:55:51.643]  They pumped the bubble up to unbelievable size, and then they cut off credit.
[00:55:54.016 --> 00:55:55.637]  They're not buying the mortgages.
[00:55:58.319 --> 00:56:01.541]  I mean, in a fiat system, you really could pump the economy up and help people.
[00:56:01.862 --> 00:56:03.122]  But they're choosing not to do that.
[00:56:03.142 --> 00:56:04.724]  It's all part of a consolidation phase.
[00:56:05.064 --> 00:56:07.145]  I'm already getting off into other subjects.
[00:56:07.185 --> 00:56:11.628]  It's just, Fox says that Mexico gives the U.S.
[00:56:11.648 --> 00:56:12.189]  $200 billion.
[00:56:12.409 --> 00:56:18.373]  Last time I saw our trade deficit with Mexico, it was $25 billion a year.
[00:56:18.894 --> 00:56:20.054]  There's a deficit of $25 billion.
[00:56:21.866 --> 00:56:22.587]  You can look that up.
[00:56:22.647 --> 00:56:23.327]  It may have changed.
[00:56:23.387 --> 00:56:25.368]  But we've always had a trade deficit with Mexico.
[00:56:25.408 --> 00:56:27.270]  We've never had a trade surplus with Mexico.
[00:56:28.591 --> 00:56:30.452]  We have a trade deficit with Mexico.
[00:56:32.413 --> 00:56:33.974]  But he knows the public doesn't know that.
[00:56:34.014 --> 00:56:36.496]  He just says, oh, we made $200 billion for America.
[00:56:37.176 --> 00:56:38.057]  What are you talking about?
[00:56:38.637 --> 00:56:41.399]  Over $200 billion a year of U.S.
[00:56:41.539 --> 00:56:46.683]  money is sent to Mexico each year.
[00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:52.607]  By Western Union and others, I think Western Union was $40 billion of it alone, the biggest piece of that.
[00:56:53.188 --> 00:56:54.268]  I know it was over $200 billion.
[00:56:54.849 --> 00:56:57.990]  I mean, we're talking about amounts of money that are just mind-blowing.
[00:57:00.912 --> 00:57:08.696]  And all the drug dealing and the rest of it, and our government gave a billion dollars to help Mexico fight the drug trade.
[00:57:09.036 --> 00:57:14.239]  Folks, I can take you to Mexico right now, to anywhere, and show you Mexican groups guarding marijuana fields.
[00:57:14.299 --> 00:57:16.080]  I mean, I haven't even been looking for it.
[00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:24.813]  And every time I'm in the interior, every time I've been down there, I've been down there probably in the interior probably 8, 9, 10 times, I don't know.
[00:57:26.053 --> 00:57:26.753]  I think about 8, 9 times.
[00:57:26.893 --> 00:57:32.495]  I've been over the border, just up here by Texas, more than that, but I like Mexico.
[00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:36.637]  But I mean, you see them in their Jeeps with machine guns guarding the marijuana.
[00:57:38.117 --> 00:57:41.398]  And then if you're on a tour bus, they pull you over and demand money from the bus driver.
[00:57:41.418 --> 00:57:42.339]  I mean, it's a cesspit.
[00:57:44.619 --> 00:57:46.060]  It's a cesspit of government evil.
[00:57:47.432 --> 00:57:52.176]  And he just gets up there to the dumb American public and says, oh, we made you 200 billion dollars.
[00:57:52.236 --> 00:57:54.117]  I mean, that is a complete lie.
[00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:59.322]  Mexico is a giant parasite on the U.S.
[00:57:59.382 --> 00:58:01.443]  Oh, no, we give you workers that power your economy.
[00:58:01.683 --> 00:58:05.827]  Your workers, on average, take double in services what they pay in taxes.
[00:58:08.509 --> 00:58:10.190]  More than half the people in the L.A.
[00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:12.072]  jails are illegal aliens.
[00:58:16.821 --> 00:58:24.629]  I mean, a giant third world country of 100 million people second off of us, run by narco-terrorists, is not a plus.
[00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:29.974]  We're gonna come back, finish up with the Fox clip, where he admits, oh, what we need is a North American Union.
[00:58:30.534 --> 00:58:37.161]  And yeah, we need our own... I mean, you know, here it is, and you can't get stupid Americans to listen!
[00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:45.634]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:45.654 --> 00:58:46.134]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.901]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.601 --> 00:59:01.722]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.363 --> 00:59:03.183]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.944 --> 00:59:04.844]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.505 --> 00:59:09.428]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.688 --> 00:59:13.791]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.471 --> 00:59:20.636]  The New World Order is imploding the dollar by design, their own policy reports going back over 30 years.
[00:59:22.217 --> 00:59:23.758]  They said before they brought down
[00:59:28.084 --> 00:59:28.684]  The dollar.
[00:59:29.024 --> 00:59:30.625]  They had to have their EU in place.
[00:59:30.725 --> 00:59:32.445]  Once they did that, they could bring down the dollars.
[00:59:32.485 --> 00:59:33.966]  We would accept the Amaro.
[00:59:34.386 --> 00:59:35.526]  It's in all their documents.
[00:59:35.846 --> 00:59:38.567]  Vicente Fox talked about it on Larry King Live Monday night.
[00:59:39.027 --> 00:59:44.349]  But he said even more on John Stewart's show how he needed a European Union style North America.
[00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:49.810]  He went on to say it's horrible that we have a fence and xenophobia.
[00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:51.791]  Mexico has a fence with Guatemala.
[00:59:52.702 --> 00:59:57.343]  They put you in a literal camp for six months and suck the money out of your family in Guatemala.
[00:59:57.583 --> 00:59:58.484]  It's been on the news.
[00:59:58.984 --> 00:59:59.584]  They catch you.
[01:00:02.185 --> 01:00:10.267]  The truth is Mexico is one of the most xenophobic, one of the most nationalistic countries in the world.
[01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:16.369]  And that's in basic textbooks on geopolitical makeup.
[01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.850]  That's not my opinion.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.522]  And so to have Fox, I mean, it's just all lies.
[01:00:26.842 --> 01:00:27.562]  It's all lies.
[01:00:29.003 --> 01:00:29.704]  Let's go back to it.
[01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:34.006]  People still come over because they can get better jobs and things.
[01:00:34.347 --> 01:00:35.187]  How long would it take?
[01:00:35.227 --> 01:00:42.112]  How high would the standard have to go before you think the tide starts to settle and shifts?
[01:00:42.192 --> 01:00:44.593]  We're at 8,000 right now, 8,000 U.S.
[01:00:44.633 --> 01:00:45.854]  dollars per capita a year.
[01:00:46.334 --> 01:00:49.016]  I think it should go all the way up to over 20.
[01:00:49.256 --> 01:00:52.278]  And that happened with Spain, with the European Union.
[01:00:52.964 --> 01:01:02.015]  Where they, joining the Union and having access to those huge cohesive funds, they were able to overcome poverty.
[01:01:02.356 --> 01:01:09.425]  And today, Spain or Ireland or Greece or Portugal are very successful nations.
[01:01:09.745 --> 01:01:11.788]  What you need is a little bit of solidarity.
[01:01:12.328 --> 01:01:19.058]  A little bit of a human attitude of working together as a team.
[01:01:19.118 --> 01:01:20.760]  What would you like to see in North America?
[01:01:21.541 --> 01:01:22.182]  So what's your team?
[01:01:22.262 --> 01:01:23.844]  You'd go with Mexico?
[01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:24.245]  Yes.
[01:01:24.505 --> 01:01:25.206]  US?
[01:01:25.566 --> 01:01:25.967]  Canada?
[01:01:25.987 --> 01:01:26.728]  You want Canada in there?
[01:01:30.113 --> 01:01:31.414]  Why doesn't South America do that?
[01:01:31.494 --> 01:01:36.496]  Why doesn't South America have some sort of South American Union, like the EU, to consolidate their power?
[01:01:36.516 --> 01:01:37.377]  There's different blocks.
[01:01:37.417 --> 01:01:40.899]  There's one in Central America, all nations there join together.
[01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:45.181]  There's one in the South, in Mercosur.
[01:01:45.341 --> 01:01:49.283]  Are you a fan of, like, Evo Morales and Hugo Chavez and those guys?
[01:01:49.443 --> 01:01:50.364]  We had Evo on the show.
[01:01:50.424 --> 01:01:51.384]  Oh, they give you a headache.
[01:01:51.745 --> 01:01:52.725]  He seemed very nice.
[01:01:53.225 --> 01:01:55.707]  He just talked a little bit about redistributing.
[01:01:55.767 --> 01:01:56.247]  Terrible.
[01:01:56.467 --> 01:01:56.807]  Terrible.
[01:01:58.883 --> 01:02:02.444]  Populism, demagoguery... Even Morales.
[01:02:02.484 --> 01:02:04.005]  I know Chavez, but Morales as well.
[01:02:04.525 --> 01:02:06.646]  Yeah, both of them in Correa and Ecuador.
[01:02:07.006 --> 01:02:07.787]  He's a fair guy.
[01:02:08.007 --> 01:02:09.067]  Now, he had an interpreter.
[01:02:09.087 --> 01:02:10.668]  Do you think he speaks English?
[01:02:10.748 --> 01:02:14.129]  No, he speaks his dialect.
[01:02:14.289 --> 01:02:14.729]  Oh, it is?
[01:02:14.849 --> 01:02:15.109]  Okay.
[01:02:15.129 --> 01:02:16.210]  Because he's indigenous.
[01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:26.814]  But it's a pity for Bolivians, for Venezuelans, not being taught to fish, but just giving the fish out.
[01:02:27.672 --> 01:02:32.435]  They're not constructing a solid economy, or industry, or jobs.
[01:02:32.635 --> 01:02:34.396]  It's just giving away the money.
[01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:35.156]  And it goes on and on.
[01:02:35.196 --> 01:02:36.317]  Later we have trouble with the rest.
[01:02:36.997 --> 01:02:39.118]  It's not like you're a capitalist, Mr. Fox.
[01:02:39.138 --> 01:02:40.319]  You're a monopoly man.
[01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.120]  I mean, look at our government.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.081]  Crippled in size.
[01:02:44.141 --> 01:02:45.081]  Total socialism.
[01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:45.762]  Shut up!
[01:02:47.943 --> 01:02:49.083]  I mean, I'm just sick of it!
[01:02:49.143 --> 01:02:50.084]  It's all lies!
[01:02:54.255 --> 01:02:56.496]  He claims that Ireland did good.
[01:02:56.856 --> 01:03:00.397]  Ireland refused to join the European Union.
[01:03:02.097 --> 01:03:04.558]  They refused to sign the Constitution.
[01:03:05.178 --> 01:03:10.380]  They have a member in its parliament, and the EU said raise taxes and don't be a tax shelter.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:17.182]  A tax avoidance nation in Ireland said, no, we're going to cut our tax to 10% flat rate.
[01:03:17.562 --> 01:03:19.563]  You bet all the investment went there.
[01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:20.743]  You bet Ireland's doing good.
[01:03:21.243 --> 01:03:23.264]  Nothing to do with the European Union.
[01:03:24.526 --> 01:03:24.926]  Nothing.
[01:03:26.307 --> 01:03:26.907]  Portugal?
[01:03:27.767 --> 01:03:30.289]  Portugal is the poorest country in the Western world.
[01:03:30.389 --> 01:03:32.169]  It's still as poor as it ever was.
[01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:34.130]  Completely run by the New World Order.
[01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:37.131]  I have never heard such baloney in my life.
[01:03:37.952 --> 01:03:39.993]  And he says, Naftan Gatzman real good for the U.S.
[01:03:40.033 --> 01:03:40.253]  too.
[01:03:40.633 --> 01:03:42.474]  Oh yeah, look how great it's been.
[01:03:42.954 --> 01:03:45.795]  But there he is admitting the North American Union.
[01:03:46.195 --> 01:03:48.096]  There he is admitting the Amaro.
[01:03:54.682 --> 01:03:55.722]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:03:56.042 --> 01:03:58.823]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:03.245]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:03.665 --> 01:04:04.505]  So what do you do?
[01:04:04.825 --> 01:04:09.387]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:04:09.867 --> 01:04:12.008]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:04:12.488 --> 01:04:13.368]  Sheltering in Place.
[01:04:13.788 --> 01:04:17.509]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:27.192]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:27.232 --> 01:04:27.632]  government.
[01:04:27.852 --> 01:04:34.274]  Gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:34.634 --> 01:04:39.036]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:04:39.496 --> 01:04:41.257]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:41.557]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:43.038]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:04:55.979 --> 01:05:01.425]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.786 --> 01:05:09.394]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:17.187]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.567 --> 01:05:28.973]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.313 --> 01:05:33.215]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.275 --> 01:05:34.936]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.536 --> 01:05:39.378]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.622]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[01:05:55.642 --> 01:05:57.283]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:05:57.483 --> 01:06:01.646]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:06:02.226 --> 01:06:07.130]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:14.055]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[01:06:14.793 --> 01:06:17.495]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:06:17.655 --> 01:06:27.621]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:31.603]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:06:31.663 --> 01:06:38.147]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:39.367]  Are you ready to go solar?
[01:06:39.567 --> 01:06:40.528]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[01:06:54.293 --> 01:07:00.335]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.955 --> 01:07:03.936]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:18.678 --> 01:07:24.122]  Larry Pratt, the head honcho over at Gun Owners of America, is our guest.
[01:07:24.162 --> 01:07:32.089]  It was founded back in the mid-1970s, 1975, to preserve and defend the Second Amendment rights of gun owners.
[01:07:32.169 --> 01:07:35.631]  Now, I have read the federal court filings.
[01:07:35.932 --> 01:07:47.701]  I have studied and even have the video of our beloved Charlton Heston on television in TV ads pushing for the 68 Gun Control Act.
[01:07:48.408 --> 01:07:55.270]  I've interviewed Charlton Heston, it was very painful for me, and I don't think he meant bad at all, but this is just an example of what we're facing.
[01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:56.831]  Pushing gun control.
[01:07:58.671 --> 01:08:14.776]  And I've always urged the second largest gun organization, second amendment rights organization in the country, in the world for that matter, and the only real gun group of any real size, to go ahead and take on the NRA.
[01:08:14.816 --> 01:08:16.797]  Because the NRA is our biggest problem.
[01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:20.221]  Uh, they were a shooting club group.
[01:08:21.282 --> 01:08:23.285]  And then when Gun Owners was formed, they started lobbying.
[01:08:23.425 --> 01:08:26.829]  Suddenly, the NRA came in and started lobbying.
[01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:30.174]  Before that, they had been a shooting club and a gun control group.
[01:08:31.155 --> 01:08:35.781]  And quite frankly, if you look at the roots of gun control, it was, let's not have those blacks owning guns.
[01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:39.734]  You study gun control history, and professors have written books about this.
[01:08:40.795 --> 01:08:43.358]  Let the poor own guns.
[01:08:43.418 --> 01:08:44.640]  Let's put a tax on them.
[01:08:45.281 --> 01:08:49.566]  And that's how the first gun control came in, was to suppress blacks and sharecroppers and others.
[01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:55.673]  Just like the first licenses, marriage licenses, were to keep blacks from marrying whites.
[01:08:56.866 --> 01:09:10.707]  The government has no business in any of this and so instead of always quote compromising and we never a compromise is if they gave up some ground and we gave up some now we always get pushed another foot towards the cliff and now we're at the cliff leaning back we can't be pushed anymore the NRA
[01:09:12.372 --> 01:09:12.993]  We're good to go!
[01:09:34.516 --> 01:09:43.281]  Hundreds of thousands of veterans and police who have any ADHD when they were 12 or collapsed in Baghdad or got any type of post-traumatic stress.
[01:09:43.361 --> 01:09:44.522]  Hundreds of designations.
[01:09:45.803 --> 01:09:48.164]  Tens of millions of Americans no more owning guns.
[01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:57.190]  And after I had Larry on last week I talked to him about 20 minutes after the show and I didn't realize how close they were to passing this and still are.
[01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.291]  We are on the very verge
[01:10:00.117 --> 01:10:01.718]  I'm step-by-step really losing it.
[01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:07.883]  And if they do this, and they can just say you've got a psychological designation, it's over, folks.
[01:10:08.264 --> 01:10:09.605]  And the NRA is supporting it.
[01:10:09.685 --> 01:10:13.528]  So, we have to get NRA board members to turn around.
[01:10:14.289 --> 01:10:20.354]  And we have to get the members of the NRA, who are good people, to really assess the information we're about to cover.
[01:10:21.054 --> 01:10:22.655]  And I'm saying stay with the NRA.
[01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:25.858]  That way good people are in it and can try to keep it on the straight and narrow.
[01:10:26.058 --> 01:10:28.040]  It's better than it has been in the past, I'll say that.
[01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:31.754]  But we need to join Governors of America.
[01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:34.096]  And all of you need to join.
[01:10:34.216 --> 01:10:34.816]  It's $20 a year.
[01:10:35.177 --> 01:10:36.938]  It's $500 for a lifetime membership.
[01:10:37.618 --> 01:10:39.559]  They need to get a YouTube channel up.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.981]  They need to do these basic things.
[01:10:42.001 --> 01:10:44.703]  They got 130, 150,000 members, I'm not sure.
[01:10:44.723 --> 01:10:51.087]  We need to get you, the members, to get back to the source, get back to a real group, and unify.
[01:10:51.687 --> 01:10:57.191]  And 150,000 of us, and hopefully get some more members in there, and get them back up to 300,000 level, like they used to be under Clinton.
[01:10:57.491 --> 01:10:58.532]  People went to sleep in the
[01:10:59.724 --> 01:11:03.105]  And the globalists made their move, like they did on everything else.
[01:11:03.145 --> 01:11:05.846]  The government's crippled in size, BATF's crippled in size.
[01:11:05.866 --> 01:11:08.827]  I mean, it's a reign of terror against the Second Amendment.
[01:11:08.987 --> 01:11:15.009]  In defense of the NRA, Bob Barr, board member last year, did say Bush has been more anti-gun than Clinton, just not in rhetoric.
[01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:17.230]  Bush was for the assault weapons ban.
[01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:19.791]  I was in a gun shop last year and they told me I was a liar.
[01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:22.332]  Until the manager said, no, he's right.
[01:11:23.959 --> 01:11:28.262]  Conservatives just can't admit that we have Judas Goats in our own midst.
[01:11:28.362 --> 01:11:29.202]  So I'm going to shut up.
[01:11:29.643 --> 01:11:34.766]  Larry Pratt is here, and I'm putting links up all over my websites.
[01:11:35.107 --> 01:11:50.758]  I have really calculated and really studied that if we got a real Second Amendment group and gave it the support it needed, and that's gun owners, the group is there, that we could effectively lobby at the state level, being coordinated by gun owners,
[01:11:51.628 --> 01:11:55.852]  That if they had the funds and the support, that we could start reversing.
[01:11:57.253 --> 01:12:02.778]  Because we've gone from what, 60% of people being against gun control to over 70% in major polls now.
[01:12:03.379 --> 01:12:04.880]  Gun control is very unpopular.
[01:12:06.463 --> 01:12:09.244]  Congress knows it's suicide, so they're doing it by stealth now.
[01:12:09.664 --> 01:12:17.607]  So we're now going to Larry Pratt to go over the history of gun control and the NRA being really the backbone of gun control in the last century.
[01:12:17.647 --> 01:12:18.767]  Larry, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:23.849]  Alex, it's always a pleasure to be with you and I really appreciate your very strong support.
[01:12:24.469 --> 01:12:39.318]  And I think it's suitable since I'm going to have a lot to say about what the NRA staff has been doing over the decades that I emphasize something that you've already said that really that the beef is with the staff and it's not with the membership.
[01:12:39.698 --> 01:12:48.343]  The membership in many cases just doesn't know what the staff has been doing because the staff has a very excellent public relations program
[01:12:49.304 --> 01:12:58.846]  I wish I could give a speech as good as a lot of their guys can give, but when you get down to what actually happens and has been happening from the very get-go,
[01:12:59.768 --> 01:13:08.551]  There's where the staff has been on their own track and forget about what the rank-and-file thought they were getting when they became a member of NRA.
[01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:18.055]  The key to understanding this comes from an American rifleman quote of their own president, Franklin Orth, in March of 1968.
[01:13:19.739 --> 01:13:24.002]  And he said something which I think is a true statement, and this is the true statement here.
[01:13:24.422 --> 01:13:32.927]  The National Rifle Association has been in support of workable, enforceable gun control legislation since its very inception in 1871.
[01:13:33.327 --> 01:13:39.271]  That is key to understanding what's been going on.
[01:13:39.831 --> 01:13:47.756]  They have not had an adversarial relationship ever that we can determine, certainly not for very long, with the government.
[01:13:48.761 --> 01:13:49.962]  Because they've been a handmaiden.
[01:13:50.724 --> 01:13:53.688]  When our chairman, Senator H.L.
[01:13:53.728 --> 01:14:00.297]  Richardson, founded Gun Owners of America, he'd already written confrontational politics.
[01:14:01.338 --> 01:14:04.403]  And that was a large reason for founding Gun Owners of America.
[01:14:04.623 --> 01:14:05.144]  Because we
[01:14:06.004 --> 01:14:15.690]  I saw that, whether you like it or not, politics is confrontational, especially when you're dealing with Marxists, which is really what most of the Democrats are.
[01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:21.373]  And you notice that for mainline media, they tell the public, be nice, be limpid, be shabby, that's how you're effective.
[01:14:21.553 --> 01:14:23.415]  That's the actual opposite.
[01:14:23.435 --> 01:14:28.598]  When you're aggressive, when you're forceful, in law, in court, in business, that's when you win.
[01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:35.502]  In fact, I'll jump ahead of a chronological history lesson that you and I would like to get to today and just
[01:14:36.042 --> 01:14:38.563]  Emphasize that point.
[01:14:39.564 --> 01:14:41.725]  In 1993, I think it was?
[01:14:41.745 --> 01:14:43.145]  No, no, no.
[01:14:43.326 --> 01:14:43.966]  It was later than that.
[01:14:44.426 --> 01:14:46.007]  I think it was in 2002.
[01:14:47.327 --> 01:14:59.193]  There was an effort that Bob Smith, Senator from New Hampshire, made at the time to improve the situation vis-a-vis the FBI.
[01:14:59.533 --> 01:15:01.114]  And the idea was that
[01:15:01.878 --> 01:15:13.893]  If a gun owner catches you, FBI, registering gun owners because they've got access to the Brady Instant Check information, which of course they have, but if you can prove it, you can take them to court.
[01:15:14.657 --> 01:15:23.062]  Normally, you can't sue the government because we have this very, very dangerous and mistaken notion that we've let our employees get away with.
[01:15:23.503 --> 01:15:35.410]  We, the people, are the sovereign, but they've ended up calling themselves the sovereign, and you can't sue them unless they, through their own condescension, give you a little window where you can sue.
[01:15:35.911 --> 01:15:39.773]  And that's what Bob Smith was attempting to do in this gun registration deal.
[01:15:40.433 --> 01:15:41.154]  At that time,
[01:15:41.852 --> 01:15:58.607]  The NRA, Larry Craig, who's on the board of the NRA, Senator from Idaho, came to Senator Smith as he was on the floor getting ready to make his motion for the amendment to allow these lawsuits, and they said, please, Senator Smith, don't do this.
[01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:00.929]  NRA's got a headcount.
[01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:02.250]  We only got 40 votes.
[01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:03.912]  We're going to lose, and if we lose,
[01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:21.726]  Oh the thought it'll be so terrible will it'll set us back who knows how far and Smith called me from the floor and he said this is what's going on what do you think and I said senator I tell you the truth we don't have a headcount actually sir we don't
[01:16:22.261 --> 01:16:28.645]  I don't terribly much believe in them because I know this is a newsflash to you, Senator, but a lot of your colleagues lie.
[01:16:30.146 --> 01:16:34.489]  And I said, look, I don't know whether you're going to win or lose this thing.
[01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:42.654]  I rather suspect you're going to win it because when these rascals are forced to go on the record, as you're fixing to do, they often vote a lot differently from what they say.
[01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:51.239]  They're giving you this 40 nonsense that we only got 40 votes because they're hoping that that'll discourage you from putting them on the record.
[01:16:52.059 --> 01:16:59.144]  And I said, if you do this win, lose, or draw, you're our hero, and we're going to tell the world that you're our hero, which we did, by the way.
[01:16:59.744 --> 01:17:02.326]  And he went, and he said, that's all I needed to know.
[01:17:02.726 --> 01:17:12.272]  And he made the motion, and he carried it with 67 votes, which would be a veto-proof majority if ever that had been at issue.
[01:17:12.853 --> 01:17:17.676]  In other words, on that one day alone, we found out on the record that there were 27 liars in the U.S.
[01:17:17.776 --> 01:17:18.076]  Senate.
[01:17:20.317 --> 01:17:20.918]  Exactly.
[01:17:21.038 --> 01:17:24.599]  Well, we found the NRA was advising and lying.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:27.841]  And I want to go through the history of this, but this is when I really woke up.
[01:17:27.921 --> 01:17:29.582]  I'd heard the NRA was trojan horse.
[01:17:29.942 --> 01:17:35.505]  I'd heard it from all these, Bernadine Smith and others that have been tracking this for 50 years.
[01:17:36.586 --> 01:17:41.589]  But in 1999, the legislative session was starting up in Texas, going into 2000.
[01:17:43.073 --> 01:17:51.979]  And they were going to ban people under 18, Junior Olympics, the 4-H clubs, any type of shooting clubs, the YMCA shooting clubs.
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:56.843]  It was also going to ban private sales at gun shows, a safe law.
[01:17:57.823 --> 01:18:03.627]  And so I went down to the legislature, and I caught bribery on tape, and that made big news.
[01:18:04.268 --> 01:18:08.110]  I mean, I just walked out, and there they were paying people off to go testify and lie.
[01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:08.631]  Subtle.
[01:18:09.031 --> 01:18:10.372]  And all this stuff was going on.
[01:18:11.278 --> 01:18:16.349]  Made the papers and we were about to beat the bill and we had hundreds of people down there to testify.
[01:18:17.168 --> 01:18:25.174]  And then the NRA came out in the Dallas Morning News and called us extremists and said they were neutral on the bill, but they were then attacking us and basically saying the bill was good.
[01:18:25.454 --> 01:18:27.816]  I mean, this was hardcore gun control.
[01:18:28.156 --> 01:18:28.597]  Absolutely.
[01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:31.058]  And the NRA was attacking us, Larry!
[01:18:31.539 --> 01:18:32.099]  Absolutely.
[01:18:32.139 --> 01:18:35.942]  Well, we've been there and done that, so I know exactly what you were going through.
[01:18:35.962 --> 01:18:41.486]  Yeah, so, I mean, folks, you know when you're in a fight and somebody walks right up to you and stabs you in the back, you know they're the enemy.
[01:18:42.327 --> 01:18:46.450]  And I'm telling you, folks, the NRA would have had their way, those bills were going to pass.
[01:18:47.268 --> 01:18:50.529]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt on the other side to get into the history of this.
[01:18:50.549 --> 01:18:50.949]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.949 --> 01:18:59.430]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:03.871]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:04.171 --> 01:19:04.711]  We listened.
[01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:09.992]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:10.272 --> 01:19:10.772]  We listened.
[01:19:11.152 --> 01:19:14.193]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:14.613 --> 01:19:15.133]  We listened.
[01:19:15.613 --> 01:19:19.678]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:19:20.058 --> 01:19:20.539]  We listened.
[01:19:20.879 --> 01:19:26.124]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:19:26.545 --> 01:19:27.906]  Again, we listened.
[01:19:28.267 --> 01:19:30.469]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity
[01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:31.209]  We're good to go.
[01:19:52.108 --> 01:19:54.369]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[01:19:54.749 --> 01:20:04.732]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[01:20:05.232 --> 01:20:10.773]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[01:20:10.813 --> 01:20:17.495]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July, with falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[01:20:17.995 --> 01:20:20.016]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[01:20:20.962 --> 01:20:28.067]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[01:20:28.467 --> 01:20:34.231]  Renting money out of thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle class citizens and discouraging savings.
[01:20:34.792 --> 01:20:39.275]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[01:20:39.295 --> 01:20:42.257]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[01:20:42.717 --> 01:20:44.339]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:44.419 --> 01:20:44.640]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:52.285 --> 01:20:56.548]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:20:56.809 --> 01:21:01.692]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:21:01.892 --> 01:21:03.233]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:21:03.414 --> 01:21:06.756]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:21:27.187 --> 01:21:28.108]  No animal testing.

[01:21:29.708 --> 01:21:31.309]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[01:22:28.517 --> 01:22:28.717]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:36.681]  Alright, Larry Pratt!
[01:23:03.141 --> 01:23:04.222]  of Gunners of America.
[01:23:04.282 --> 01:23:05.882]  Larry, let's get into it.
[01:23:05.902 --> 01:23:12.925]  Let's get into the history of how it started up, how the gun control began, and then where the NRA comes in, so people know the truth.
[01:23:13.786 --> 01:23:25.111]  Well, let's repeat again, I think the kind of keystone to this whole thing was a statement by Franklin Orth at the time of the gun control debate in 1968.
[01:23:25.191 --> 01:23:28.352]  In the American Rifleman, the March issue,
[01:23:29.053 --> 01:23:29.313]  I think?
[01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:56.412]  You can confiscate guns and you can prepare people for genocide, so I guess in that sense, there have been workable and enforceable gun control laws.
[01:23:56.473 --> 01:24:04.836]  But the idea of keeping guns out of criminals' hands, well, even the government has admitted that there's not a gun control law in the books.
[01:24:05.396 --> 01:24:10.698]  All of them have studied, and that was the Center for Disease Control that I'm talking about.
[01:24:10.758 --> 01:24:15.340]  Also, the National Academy of Sciences, which is a non-governmental organization, both have said
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:21.322]  There's not a gun control law in the world that's kept guns... All you can do is disarm victims.
[01:24:21.643 --> 01:24:24.064]  That's all you can do because they're the only ones that will participate.
[01:24:24.424 --> 01:24:28.886]  The criminal, by definition, is not going to keep that law either.
[01:24:29.006 --> 01:24:36.569]  Golly, if he's going to murder somebody, do we really think that telling him that he can't have a gun is going to keep him from having one and getting one?
[01:24:37.269 --> 01:24:40.371]  So, anyway, that's the mindset.
[01:24:40.411 --> 01:24:42.072]  Now, why would they have such a mindset?
[01:24:42.112 --> 01:24:56.199]  Well, after the war between the states, there were a bunch of union officers who had come to the conclusion that the draftees, many of whom were, by the way, very reluctantly drafted, and there were draft riots where the
[01:24:56.739 --> 01:24:59.380]  Government shot people in New York City and other places.
[01:25:00.341 --> 01:25:03.202]  But we don't have to fight that war all over again at the moment.
[01:25:03.282 --> 01:25:05.824]  But they didn't shoot very well.
[01:25:05.844 --> 01:25:10.846]  They were recent immigrants, many of them, Irish especially, coming in right off the boat.
[01:25:10.946 --> 01:25:13.407]  Way to get your citizenship, fight in the Union Army.
[01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:15.088]  Well, they didn't shoot very well.
[01:25:15.148 --> 01:25:16.709]  They didn't have much experience.
[01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:20.651]  And the Southern boys were largely rural and they were quite good shots.
[01:25:21.151 --> 01:25:22.652]  And so Union officers
[01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:24.673]  We're good to go.
[01:25:38.659 --> 01:25:51.031]  And I think to the extent that the NRA has kept to the business of teaching people safety and shooting skills and things like that, they've actually accomplished that mission.
[01:25:51.051 --> 01:25:55.496]  They've done very well, but the pity is... But from the beginning it was an auxiliary of government
[01:25:56.276 --> 01:25:57.377]  For the federal government.
[01:25:57.417 --> 01:26:00.699]  It was a minion, as you said, a handmaiden of the feds.
[01:26:00.799 --> 01:26:01.239]  Bingo.
[01:26:01.679 --> 01:26:05.481]  And that was the mindset that spread over into politics.
[01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:24.032]  And so, when there was a reaction against blacks having guns, even in the early part of the 20th century, Michigan, for instance, had a very famous case where a black doctor had moved into a white neighborhood in, I believe it was Detroit,
[01:26:24.814 --> 01:26:33.763]  And he met such resistance that there were mobs outside of his house and it was getting pretty nasty one day and a shot was fired.
[01:26:33.783 --> 01:26:36.626]  We've never figured out who fired the shot from inside the house.
[01:26:37.146 --> 01:26:40.550]  He had a number of relatives with him to help defend the place.
[01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:43.533]  But one of the punks outside was killed.
[01:26:44.253 --> 01:26:49.795]  And to the credit of the white jury, they acquitted the doctor, but the legislature fixed the problem, quote unquote.
[01:26:50.456 --> 01:27:00.760]  They passed the concealed carry law for the state of Michigan as a direct response to the doctors having been able to defend himself.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:01.901]  And in the 20s and in the 30s,
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:09.246]  Concealed Carry Laws went on the books of every single state in the nation bar none.
[01:27:09.587 --> 01:27:19.217]  Now interestingly, and the NRA at a minimum didn't oppose those, there's no record, I really haven't been able to research that well, but
[01:27:20.117 --> 01:27:33.620]  I do know that Vermont was the only state that ultimately escaped these laws because, believe it or not, their Supreme Court at the time found that it was unconstitutional and tossed the law off the books and it never has come back.
[01:27:34.261 --> 01:27:43.383]  Vermont has been one of the now almost three states, most of Montana, all of Alaska, and all of Vermont are states where you can carry a gun without anybody's permission.
[01:27:44.523 --> 01:27:48.245]  Vermont has remained that way, and it also remained a very low crime state.
[01:27:48.666 --> 01:27:51.167]  But that was the history of the 20s and the 30s.
[01:27:51.847 --> 01:27:57.170]  Gun control was clearly people control, and certain targeted people.
[01:27:57.610 --> 01:28:07.496]  There was a judge in a Florida case that was quite candid, said, we know who these laws were intended to target, and went on to say exactly who it was.
[01:28:07.536 --> 01:28:09.677]  It was the black population of the country.
[01:28:09.697 --> 01:28:10.457]  Then, in 1934,
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:16.661]  There was the National Firearms Act before the Congress.
[01:28:16.681 --> 01:28:17.101]  Stay there!
[01:28:17.141 --> 01:28:20.501]  That's the key when our little friends the NRA show up on the scene.
[01:28:21.422 --> 01:28:23.242]  The defenders of the Second Amendment.
[01:28:24.322 --> 01:28:26.523]  The authors of all the gun control.
[01:28:26.543 --> 01:28:35.485]  And we're going to write an article up out of the analysis of Larry Pratt today and the next few days for PrisonPlanet.com and TruthNews.us.
[01:28:35.925 --> 01:28:41.586]  And then it's up to you to get it out to all your gun-owning friends to deprogram them or we will lose.
[01:28:43.667 --> 01:28:46.689]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:50.352]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.514 --> 01:28:58.998]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:28:59.418 --> 01:29:03.661]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:04.081 --> 01:29:10.946]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:11.366 --> 01:29:18.075]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:18.416 --> 01:29:20.018]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:29:20.318 --> 01:29:23.502]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:23.783 --> 01:29:26.246]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:29:26.546 --> 01:29:27.668]  BioSolutions has over 550
[01:29:28.749 --> 01:29:29.249]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.317 --> 01:29:58.243]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:29:58.583 --> 01:30:00.465]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:03.689]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:30:03.869 --> 01:30:07.013]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:30:07.313 --> 01:30:09.135]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:30:09.435 --> 01:30:09.795]  We're good to go.
[01:30:38.021 --> 01:30:40.984]  Tyrants and Wars, The New World Order, and much more!
[01:30:41.284 --> 01:30:43.727]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[01:30:43.927 --> 01:30:44.748]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:30:44.768 --> 01:30:45.108]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:30:45.128 --> 01:30:46.109]  And ask for Packet B.
[01:30:53.414 --> 01:30:55.537]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:30:55.897 --> 01:30:58.981]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:03.786]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.770]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:31:07.290 --> 01:31:13.998]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:31:14.238 --> 01:31:14.438]  Yeah!
[01:31:14.458 --> 01:31:19.680]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.781]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:31:22.261 --> 01:31:25.582]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:31:26.102 --> 01:31:29.504]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:31:29.544 --> 01:31:36.526]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:31:36.886 --> 01:31:42.268]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:31:42.609 --> 01:31:43.569]  Share the oil company
[01:31:43.749 --> 01:31:44.329]  We're good to go.
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.101]  Larry Pratt is our guest.
[01:32:22.302 --> 01:32:23.563]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:32:25.724 --> 01:32:27.566]  I'm here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[01:32:27.626 --> 01:32:28.367]  until 2 p.m.
[01:32:28.407 --> 01:32:39.456]  Central Standard Time blasting out on a growing list of wonderful AM and FM stations like 1330 just north of Austin and Cameron covering Austin and of course Waco.
[01:32:40.237 --> 01:32:44.120]  KLBJ 590 right here in Austin with their stations all over the country.
[01:32:45.361 --> 01:32:48.264]  Like the folks out in Needles, California going into three states
[01:32:49.079 --> 01:32:55.004]  Upstate New York, Kansas City, Knoxville, Tennessee, areas in Florida, all over.
[01:32:55.044 --> 01:32:56.225]  We're very thankful to all of you.
[01:32:56.485 --> 01:33:03.371]  We're also on WWCR, Global Shortwave, 6 hours a day, the 3 hours live, and then back from 9 to midnight Central Time.
[01:33:03.571 --> 01:33:12.579]  24 hours a day we restream the show, so technically 3 hours live and 21 hours of retransmission back-to-back at infowars.com and truthnews.us.
[01:33:12.599 --> 01:33:14.421]  Everybody loves that site.
[01:33:15.602 --> 01:33:17.183]  Just launched it two weeks ago with Curt Nemo.
[01:33:18.098 --> 01:33:22.663]  And so, again, we're able to reach more people and get the word out when you spread the word.
[01:33:22.683 --> 01:33:25.486]  So tell folks about the free podcast at Infowars.com.
[01:33:26.027 --> 01:33:27.028]  Tell them about the screams.
[01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:28.950]  Tell them about the fight for liberty.
[01:33:29.571 --> 01:33:31.032]  And tell them about the NRA.
[01:33:31.052 --> 01:33:32.934]  I mean, we have them absolute dead to rights.
[01:33:32.954 --> 01:33:34.316]  We have them caught red-handed.
[01:33:35.076 --> 01:33:36.017]  They're not even hiding it.
[01:33:36.057 --> 01:33:36.778]  It's their history.
[01:33:37.379 --> 01:33:39.962]  And they are, I've got to say it myself, a barrel of snakes.
[01:33:40.812 --> 01:33:41.292]  At the top.
[01:33:41.372 --> 01:33:42.993]  And I'm just so sick of good ol' boys.
[01:33:43.553 --> 01:33:44.373]  I go in gun shops.
[01:33:44.393 --> 01:33:46.054]  They're like, yeah, they're gonna ban guns.
[01:33:46.074 --> 01:33:46.814]  Don't wing do.
[01:33:47.214 --> 01:33:48.515]  Yeah, it's all over.
[01:33:48.655 --> 01:33:50.155]  Eddie Eagle can't save us.
[01:33:50.195 --> 01:33:50.715]  Yeah.
[01:33:51.396 --> 01:33:52.316]  We keep losing.
[01:33:52.536 --> 01:33:55.457]  You keep losing because you got enemies inside the gates.
[01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:58.118]  You got traitors inside the gates.
[01:33:58.198 --> 01:33:58.798]  I'm sorry.
[01:33:59.618 --> 01:34:04.220]  Now, I studied and looked at other gun groups, and I'm telling you, Gunners of America, they're the people.
[01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:08.493]  And I have seen this as a major chink in the New World Order's armor.
[01:34:08.513 --> 01:34:13.195]  We can get Gun Owners of America members mobilized to be activists federally and at the state level.
[01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:22.419]  We can get our listeners to become members of Gun Owners of America and tell other NRA members that they're the folks that need to be supported.
[01:34:22.999 --> 01:34:25.340]  Then we can have a stronger, no-compromise lobby.
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:32.042]  Listen, the NRA is up there pushing right now for gun control, and we're going to tell you about these horrible bills in a few minutes if we talk more about the history.
[01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:35.288]  It's simple.
[01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:45.855]  If you don't go to the breach in the wall, and if you don't admit that we've got wolves in sheep's clothing, enemies dressed up in our own uniforms, it's over.
[01:34:47.336 --> 01:34:47.736]  It's over.
[01:34:48.097 --> 01:34:52.439]  They've tripled the size of the BATF, they're not playing tiddlywinks, this is not a joke.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.742]  And they're brainwashing the children in the schools, they're trying to pass gun laws right now.
[01:34:56.822 --> 01:34:59.684]  We're in a crisis, and Hillary is coming.
[01:35:00.718 --> 01:35:01.859]  I hope Ron Paul gets in there.
[01:35:01.919 --> 01:35:04.102]  We've got to hope for the best, plan for the worst.
[01:35:04.142 --> 01:35:08.686]  Before we get into the history, let's just do it right now because I really want people to join Gun Owners.
[01:35:09.047 --> 01:35:10.628]  You're the second largest group in the country.
[01:35:10.668 --> 01:35:12.030]  You don't get the support you need.
[01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:20.518]  If we could only reach every NRA member, we can only reach a fraction, but you the listeners can reach all of them if you try over time, then we could turn this around and win.
[01:35:20.618 --> 01:35:22.220]  This is a place where we can win.
[01:35:23.275 --> 01:35:24.636]  We're already having a lot of victories.
[01:35:24.756 --> 01:35:27.337]  You guys are the ones that keep beating the gun bills.
[01:35:27.357 --> 01:35:32.720]  The NRA is supporting them coast-to-coast while putting out lip service about how they're for the Second Amendment.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:33.980]  How do people call?
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:34.841]  How do they join?
[01:35:35.141 --> 01:35:36.261]  How do they get the newsletter?
[01:35:36.301 --> 01:35:37.622]  How do they get the email alerts?
[01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:42.064]  How do they help defend the Second Amendment in its darkest hour?
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.882]  Well, we have a website they can go to and a toll-free number.
[01:35:46.162 --> 01:35:54.907]  The website, pretty simple, gunowners.org, and we'll talk some more about what they can do on that website in a minute.
[01:35:55.607 --> 01:35:59.009]  But the membership information is on that site.
[01:35:59.049 --> 01:36:00.810]  Just scroll down and you'll see how to join.
[01:36:01.230 --> 01:36:01.550]  Simple.
[01:36:02.271 --> 01:36:08.074]  If you can't get to the computer, don't want to do that, you can call our toll-free number, which is 888-6-GUNS.
[01:36:08.094 --> 01:36:08.974]  That's 888-6-GUNS.
[01:36:13.639 --> 01:36:15.520]  886 and then G-U-N-S.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:28.202]  And either way, we would very much welcome the increased support because it means we're going to have more people able to and actually communicating with members of Congress.
[01:36:28.402 --> 01:36:29.602]  Man, does that make the difference.
[01:36:29.682 --> 01:36:32.603]  Well, Larry, I mean, I'm not fighting the New World Order to lose.
[01:36:32.623 --> 01:36:33.803]  You're not fighting to lose.
[01:36:34.423 --> 01:36:39.384]  I have been the last, really, decades studying the gun votes, looking at the politics,
[01:36:40.203 --> 01:36:50.487]  And I've known since 2000 the NRA were treacherous enemies of the Second Amendment, but I've talked to gun owner groups and they just can't believe it.
[01:36:50.847 --> 01:36:53.308]  We now have to prove this to them or we're going to lose it.
[01:36:54.068 --> 01:36:59.130]  And folks, we have a chance here to defend the absolute bedrock of this republic.
[01:36:59.690 --> 01:37:03.232]  The Second Amendment, again that's 8886GUNS, 8886GUNS, or gunowners.org, there's links
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:16.623]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, this is a major place that we can defend the Republic.
[01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:22.526]  You know, I'm here every day fighting for our borders, fighting for our sovereignty, trying to get you to take action, listeners, and you do.
[01:37:23.287 --> 01:37:25.768]  I'm here every day trying to get you to defend the Second Amendment.
[01:37:25.848 --> 01:37:29.910]  I'm here every day trying to defend our borders and our sovereignty and our dollar.
[01:37:30.370 --> 01:37:34.512]  I mean, it's all imploding right now, and the key is the Second Amendment.
[01:37:34.712 --> 01:37:36.313]  We're here trying to support Ron Paul.
[01:37:36.957 --> 01:37:40.418]  I mean, we have a loser attitude that we can't win.
[01:37:40.799 --> 01:37:42.099]  We have been winning.
[01:37:42.359 --> 01:37:45.741]  The majority of Americans are now waking up, but they're not involved.
[01:37:46.321 --> 01:37:47.681]  Larry, I mean, I've seen the polls.
[01:37:48.182 --> 01:37:54.284]  What, 87% of anti-gun candidates have lost the last three rounds.
[01:37:55.845 --> 01:38:02.888]  Polls show more Americans now get it, and that the anti-gunners are running out of steam, but they've got the politicians.
[01:38:03.268 --> 01:38:03.948]  Can you speak to that?
[01:38:04.268 --> 01:38:20.534]  Well, the poll that was most significant was conducted in November of 1994, and no less than Bill Clinton himself confessed that he had made a mistake to push the gun ban, that that had cost his party control of the Congress.
[01:38:21.354 --> 01:38:33.358]  And Al Gore apparently didn't get that memo, and when he was in the presidential primary with Senator Bill Bradley, he and Bradley had this, uh, I'm more anti-gun than you are,
[01:38:34.005 --> 01:38:40.168]  Apparently, Gore won that contest in the primary, but that's what kept him from winning the general election.
[01:38:40.608 --> 01:38:45.431]  And so, at that point, I think the Democrats, all of them, just about got the memo.
[01:38:45.771 --> 01:38:51.594]  They're not doing anything that is advertised as gun control.
[01:38:52.075 --> 01:38:56.657]  And so, yeah, the polls, especially the ones that politicians really know about,
[01:38:57.752 --> 01:38:59.333]  Those are, the results are in.
[01:38:59.874 --> 01:39:02.515]  You stand for gun control, you're looking for a new job.
[01:39:02.735 --> 01:39:08.619]  So instead they're doing it by stealth now and actually being more successful than the old frontal assault.
[01:39:08.699 --> 01:39:13.342]  Give them a call, $20 a year, $500 for a lifetime membership.
[01:39:13.863 --> 01:39:20.507]  I mean if you won't support Ron Paul now, if you won't support Governors of America now, if you won't support American Patrol,
[01:39:20.947 --> 01:39:27.516]  If you won't support the Minutemen, if you won't support the real groups that are out there actually fighting, then you deserve what you get.
[01:39:28.217 --> 01:39:34.105]  And I'm telling all the good old boys right now who don't believe me, hey, you better look into the NRA.
[01:39:34.125 --> 01:39:35.567]  You better find out this is true.
[01:39:36.127 --> 01:39:37.329]  Because we're telling you the truth.
[01:39:37.369 --> 01:39:38.731]  Believe me, I wish it wasn't the truth.
[01:39:39.648 --> 01:39:45.311]  Well, let's take a look at what the NRA staff was doing, actually the president of the organization.
[01:39:45.331 --> 01:39:47.312]  Yeah, let's go back to the 30s and the 60s and right up to now.
[01:39:48.012 --> 01:39:59.798]  In a letter to the Congress in 1934, and we just happened to run across this the other day doing some legal research at the, well I don't know if it was at the archives or on some website, but got it anyway.
[01:40:01.198 --> 01:40:08.562]  President of the NRA at that time was Carl T. Frederick, and Mr. Frederick wrote a letter, and in part I quote,
[01:40:09.422 --> 01:40:13.744]  It was about the machine gun, technically a tax.
[01:40:13.764 --> 01:40:17.446]  $200 in that day would be probably, what, $20,000 today?
[01:40:17.466 --> 01:40:17.966]  Yeah.
[01:40:18.286 --> 01:40:19.087]  Something like that.
[01:40:19.127 --> 01:40:24.870]  In other words, it was a prohibition for all but the richest of boys, or the ones, of course, who were exempt.
[01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:29.772]  In the 30s, you could buy a three-bedroom house for $2,000 or $3,000.
[01:40:30.192 --> 01:40:32.173]  I think so, and probably a pretty nice one at that.
[01:40:32.713 --> 01:40:34.234]  I believe that's absolutely correct.
[01:40:34.976 --> 01:40:37.778]  And also you would have had to put half down to get it, minimum.
[01:40:37.818 --> 01:40:39.239]  You couldn't get more credit than that.
[01:40:39.859 --> 01:40:40.699]  How times have changed.
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:47.183]  Anyway, he's writing about the proposed machine gun ban, tax, whatever you want to call it.
[01:40:48.082 --> 01:40:55.908]  And what I'm about to read is a description, actually, of a selective fire weapon, but he doesn't use that term.
[01:40:56.348 --> 01:41:01.252]  The first criticism that I have, Mr. Frederick said, to make is on page 1, lines 8 to 10.
[01:41:01.592 --> 01:41:05.915]  The definition of the term machine gun, I think, is wholly inadequate.
[01:41:07.016 --> 01:41:08.158]  And unsatisfactory.
[01:41:08.598 --> 01:41:16.589]  A gun which fires automatically or semi-automatically, less than 12 shots, is not under this definition a machine gun.
[01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:20.955]  And yet in my opinion, it is in fact a machine gun and should be so classified.
[01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:21.316]  Meaning,
[01:41:22.116 --> 01:41:25.318]  It's not enough to ban a machine gun with a magazine that holds more than 12.
[01:41:26.779 --> 01:41:29.241]  He wants to have it banned all the way down.
[01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:32.343]  So this is more hardcore than Hillary and Bill Clinton in 1993.
[01:41:32.383 --> 01:41:33.163]  And this is back in 1934.
[01:41:33.223 --> 01:41:34.964]  This has banned most types of rifles and handguns.
[01:41:39.447 --> 01:41:42.190]  I honestly, well certainly if they were select or fire.
[01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:47.434]  Now I think this was probably even to the left of the Roosevelt administration.
[01:41:47.555 --> 01:41:54.321]  I mean liberals in those days weren't always, well they certainly weren't the hard hate America crowd that we got today.
[01:41:55.281 --> 01:42:04.129]  I don't know where Roosevelt was on this, frankly, but the fact of the matter is that apparently he was being taken to task by the head of the NRA!
[01:42:04.349 --> 01:42:05.891]  I mean, it just blows your mind!
[01:42:06.191 --> 01:42:06.611]  It hurts!
[01:42:08.172 --> 01:42:13.817]  Anyway, they got the bill through, bless their heart, and I haven't studied it.
[01:42:13.897 --> 01:42:20.343]  I don't know what their role was in 1938 when dealers were forced to get a federal license in order to sell firearms.
[01:42:21.191 --> 01:42:22.492]  I looked at it, they were behind that.
[01:42:23.092 --> 01:42:27.253]  Well, you know, that would be so in keeping.
[01:42:27.753 --> 01:42:48.300]  Now, in 68, actually prior to 68 gun control law passing, they had been working with Senator Dodd, and they had been supporting measures such as no handgun sales in a store to a customer if the customer is out of his home state, ending of direct mail sales of guns,
[01:42:50.321 --> 01:43:00.891]  And I think they insisted before, in 68, they were kind of opposing or supporting the bill, but they sort of dropped off at one point.
[01:43:01.271 --> 01:43:16.785]  They were happy with, I know one of the things they had supported was to get the sporting provision into the law so that the federal government would determine what kind of gun could be imported, namely only one that passed a sporting use test.
[01:43:17.765 --> 01:43:25.468]  And they wanted to make it not about a right to keep bear arms for the defense of your home and hearth against criminals and government.
[01:43:25.768 --> 01:43:27.408]  They wanted to make it all about hunting.
[01:43:28.048 --> 01:43:29.529]  That is absolutely correct.
[01:43:29.549 --> 01:43:33.410]  So we have them now destroying a criminal assault on the Second Amendment.
[01:43:34.356 --> 01:43:43.326]  That is, well, certainly it was, I think, too, in 1934, but this is even more obvious in 1968.
[01:43:43.506 --> 01:43:48.291]  And then it gets more and more obvious as time goes by.
[01:43:48.331 --> 01:43:48.992]  The D.C.
[01:43:49.432 --> 01:43:50.914]  Council passed a gun ban.
[01:43:51.514 --> 01:44:05.319]  And I was on the scene at this time, and I remember going to the NRA and saying, look, you only need to have one house at that time, that's all it needed, either the Senate or the House, to veto what was just done by the D.C.
[01:44:05.359 --> 01:44:07.500]  Council, because constitutionally the D.C.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:10.141]  City Council is under the United States Congress.
[01:44:10.881 --> 01:44:20.624]  And the NRA's response, the new ILA director at that time, because they had just been formed, said, we're not going to waste any of our political capital on doing something like that.
[01:44:20.664 --> 01:44:21.764]  We'll take care of it in court.
[01:44:22.444 --> 01:44:38.949]  Well, it took them 30 years to get to court, and when they finally did, it was only in an effort to head off the very clever suit that now is on its way to the Supreme Court, formulated by Bob Levy and litigated by Alan Gura.
[01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:40.931]  So let's recap this.
[01:44:41.391 --> 01:44:51.601]  They're formed as an auxiliary of the federal government to create better marksmanship for a pool of people that could become soldiers under a draft at the end of the Civil War.
[01:44:52.082 --> 01:44:52.322]  Correct.
[01:44:52.442 --> 01:44:53.343]  Okay, so we're talking like 1869, 1870.
[01:44:55.385 --> 01:45:07.894]  Then from that point on, they want to list even more guns, semi-automatic rifles and handguns, in the $200 tax and regulatory control of the BATF.
[01:45:07.914 --> 01:45:11.096]  Then in 1968, they control the Gun Control Act.
[01:45:11.137 --> 01:45:17.161]  Senator Dodd, who had been involved in the Nuremberg trials, got the Nazi gun control laws, the Nuremberg
[01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:19.231]  Well, Ben, let's see.
[01:45:19.371 --> 01:45:20.212]  We're running short of time.
[01:45:40.847 --> 01:45:42.869]  We'll just go through it all.
[01:45:42.889 --> 01:45:46.010]  I know there's so much, but just keep telling people.
[01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:52.694]  In 1991, they testified in favor of gun-free zones at schools.
[01:45:52.714 --> 01:46:01.640]  And after Columbine, Wayne LaPierre repeated that position, and these are his words, he at the time was the executive director of their
[01:46:02.515 --> 01:46:14.322]  political lobbying army institute for legislative action he said this we believe in absolutely gun-free zero tolerance totally safe schools that means no guns in america schools period
[01:46:15.163 --> 01:46:27.233]  And so that means the police have trouble having guns, it means that the principal can't have a gun, versus the day when my dad would walk in with a shotgun and put it in his locker and go hunting after school with his friends and no one even looked at him and there was never any school shootings.
[01:46:28.013 --> 01:46:36.420]  We've got members that grew up in New York City and took their guns to school on the subway, their rifles, because they had target practice at their schools.
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.962]  Typically it was junior ROTC.
[01:46:39.102 --> 01:46:43.606]  And back then if somebody came into the school to shoot people, it did happen a couple times, they were blasted within seconds.
[01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:44.612]  Absolutely.
[01:46:44.692 --> 01:46:59.889]  Now, you know, this is a little off subject, but just the other day I saw an article from a Norwegian newspaper that up at the Arctic Circle, there's a little town, and the first day of school, the thing that is taught to the kids is how to use the rifles that they must bring to school.
[01:47:00.429 --> 01:47:00.710]  Why?
[01:47:01.010 --> 01:47:03.653]  Well, they might get jumped by a polar bear, and the kids are on their own!
[01:47:05.054 --> 01:47:05.655]  Absolutely!
[01:47:07.315 --> 01:47:10.317]  It's just a rather different point of view.
[01:47:10.337 --> 01:47:13.738]  By the way, up in Alaskan places they've tried to make people not hunt polar bears.
[01:47:13.778 --> 01:47:14.959]  Their numbers are exploding.
[01:47:15.879 --> 01:47:17.660]  And so now they're attacking people again.
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:19.981]  You have to shoot a few of them so they know not to do that.
[01:47:20.241 --> 01:47:21.242]  That's a big animal.
[01:47:21.662 --> 01:47:24.523]  One swat from his paw and you're finished.
[01:47:24.603 --> 01:47:27.084]  Yeah, it's a lot bigger than a grizzly, a lot bigger than a kodiak.
[01:47:27.485 --> 01:47:29.926]  And that's the point is those bears are smart folks.
[01:47:29.986 --> 01:47:32.747]  You have to kill a couple or they will start coming and killing you.
[01:47:33.522 --> 01:47:45.546]  Now, in the Brady Law, the bill was put forth... By the way, this is a good lesson in confrontational politics, that the other side understands so much better than, quote, our side.
[01:47:45.986 --> 01:47:53.229]  The Brady Law had been promoted for 12 years before it was finally enacted on its 13th year.
[01:47:54.409 --> 01:47:55.790]  Bad luck number for us, I guess.
[01:47:56.891 --> 01:48:09.719]  And they just kept coming, and they weren't embarrassed that they kept losing because they kept using each defeat to generate more and more support because they were directing debate on their terms to it, and they weren't being effectively answered.
[01:48:09.839 --> 01:48:15.062]  Instead of other counterattacks, if we launched counterattacks, we would build support and be able to reverse gun control.
[01:48:15.282 --> 01:48:15.783]  Bingo.
[01:48:16.024 --> 01:48:17.447]  Absolutely correct.
[01:48:17.547 --> 01:48:19.511]  We have seen that from our own experience.
[01:48:19.531 --> 01:48:20.813]  And that's what I'm doing here, folks!
[01:48:20.853 --> 01:48:25.904]  I'm begging you to attack with Ron Paul, to attack with gun owners, to attack for our freedom back!
[01:48:27.017 --> 01:48:27.357]  Go ahead.
[01:48:27.617 --> 01:48:46.167]  Okay, well, the measure could have been stopped in 93, but the NRA, like they're doing right now, told the Congress, no, we support this because now we've got the instant background check in it, and after five years it becomes totally our bill.
[01:48:47.147 --> 01:48:48.408]  Well, that's correct.
[01:48:48.568 --> 01:48:48.948]  It did.
[01:48:48.968 --> 01:48:53.631]  The waiting period went away, and bad as the waiting period was, that's nothing,
[01:48:54.111 --> 01:49:00.875]  Compared to the intervention in our privacy and in our exercise of a constitutional liberty that is represented.
[01:49:01.075 --> 01:49:02.196]  But see how they rig this?
[01:49:02.236 --> 01:49:05.378]  They go, oh don't worry, the NRA sponsored it.
[01:49:05.858 --> 01:49:07.899]  The Brady Bill, oh we're getting a treat!
[01:49:08.199 --> 01:49:12.502]  So instead of a five day waiting period, you get instant federal registration!
[01:49:13.042 --> 01:49:31.350]  And you have to prove your innocence, and so if some cop shop somewhere put in a bunch of parking tickets the way they did in Texas, you've got to prove to the government that you're innocent of that, that you're not facing a disqualifying... And now they're going to add not just a restraining order because you're in a divorce, which is standard.
[01:49:31.751 --> 01:49:34.532]  Now they're going to add ADHD, post-traumatic stress.
[01:49:35.372 --> 01:49:37.573]  Remember all the cops lost their jobs last time in 2000.
[01:49:37.753 --> 01:49:39.154]  Folks, it's going to happen again.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.843]  And the NRA, our little friend, is the one doing it.
[01:49:44.424 --> 01:49:46.665]  Our dear, sweet Judas Iscariot.
[01:49:46.685 --> 01:49:50.188]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt, GunOwners.org.
[01:49:50.208 --> 01:49:59.556]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.896 --> 01:50:01.838]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.198 --> 01:50:09.804]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.515 --> 01:50:17.579]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.979 --> 01:50:29.385]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.705 --> 01:50:33.347]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.688 --> 01:50:35.629]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.929 --> 01:50:39.711]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.243 --> 01:50:58.486]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.626 --> 01:51:06.711]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.971 --> 01:51:14.015]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.215 --> 01:51:15.496]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.576 --> 01:51:21.460]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:26.744]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.864 --> 01:51:35.730]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:39.513]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:41.394 --> 01:51:41.655]  We're good.
[01:51:52.777 --> 01:51:53.458]  It's a fact.
[01:51:53.638 --> 01:52:01.183]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:52:01.283 --> 01:52:09.809]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, all debt has become mathematically impossible to repay, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:20.716]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:52:20.956 --> 01:52:27.079]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:52:27.299 --> 01:52:32.342]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:52:32.542 --> 01:52:37.045]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:52:37.225 --> 01:52:39.046]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:52:39.066 --> 01:52:39.286]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:52:39.326 --> 01:52:39.786]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:52:39.906 --> 01:52:41.787]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:52:49.111 --> 01:52:51.553]  Is it getting better?
[01:52:51.733 --> 01:52:56.475]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:52:56.535 --> 01:53:01.138]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:53:21.556 --> 01:53:27.761]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:53:29.162 --> 01:53:34.968]  Gonna be shipping on November 1st, EPS.
[01:53:35.048 --> 01:53:40.292]  Pre-orders are pouring in at InfoWars.com.
[01:53:40.873 --> 01:53:45.477]  We've traveled to two different Goldenberg meetings in Turkey and of course in Canada.
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.442]  That's just part of the two-hour, twenty-minute film.
[01:53:48.762 --> 01:53:53.946]  We show you how Eugenics controls the New World Order, why they want to set up world government, what their plan is.
[01:53:56.628 --> 01:53:58.569]  It blows away every film I've ever made, folks.
[01:53:58.590 --> 01:54:02.733]  You can pre-order Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement right now so you get the DVD first.
[01:54:04.214 --> 01:54:06.396]  And we're pre-packaging them all.
[01:54:06.716 --> 01:54:09.738]  I have an agreement with the distributor I can't ship these out until November 1st.
[01:54:10.519 --> 01:54:12.901]  And so again, they will be shipping out to you November 1st.
[01:54:14.119 --> 01:54:16.301]  Packaging them, piling them up, ship them out to you.
[01:54:16.781 --> 01:54:18.022]  Infowars.com.
[01:54:18.102 --> 01:54:20.324]  You can order there or call 888-253-3139.
[01:54:20.344 --> 01:54:20.424]  888-253-3139.
[01:54:20.464 --> 01:54:21.885]  But don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:21.905 --> 01:54:23.306]  It will be posted there October 26th.
[01:54:23.346 --> 01:54:26.929]  At midnight, when that day starts, you will be able to download it in super high quality
[01:54:38.672 --> 01:54:41.633]  You'll be able to see it first for our members at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:41.653 --> 01:54:44.534]  So go ahead and get your 15 cent a day, $5.95 a month membership.
[01:54:45.034 --> 01:54:47.255]  Back to GunOwners.org.
[01:54:48.416 --> 01:54:50.216]  Again, it's all about getting the info out.
[01:54:50.276 --> 01:54:51.817]  Larry, we've got a few minutes in this segment.
[01:54:51.837 --> 01:54:53.017]  I'm going to hold you over to the next.
[01:54:53.057 --> 01:54:53.878]  I appreciate that.
[01:54:54.358 --> 01:54:55.738]  Again, the Director of Gun Owners of America.
[01:54:56.099 --> 01:55:02.221]  Run through the Brady Bill and what the Judas Iscariot, Judas Goat NRA did there.
[01:55:03.024 --> 01:55:05.748]  Well, primarily it all happened in 93.
[01:55:05.788 --> 01:55:19.968]  They succeeded in attaching the instant background check to what had been the traditional, for the 12 years of its previous history, the traditional waiting period that would be required at the national level.
[01:55:20.786 --> 01:55:30.850]  And they, well, Tonya Metaxas, who had been their director of the Institute for Legislative Action at that time, said, I think this agreement was a victory for those who see flaws in the current bill.
[01:55:31.150 --> 01:55:32.730]  This is a much different Brady Bill.
[01:55:32.770 --> 01:55:36.912]  This bill sunsets into what we've been supporting for several years, the instant check.
[01:55:37.372 --> 01:55:40.653]  If you look at it in the long range, it's our bill in five years!
[01:55:43.090 --> 01:55:52.735]  And so they didn't try to block, which then federalized everything and brought federal control and databases into police departments that they're now using for other police state reasons.
[01:55:53.035 --> 01:55:55.116]  Now they're saying they're going to bar you with misdemeanors.
[01:55:55.436 --> 01:55:58.497]  Now they're talking about barring you if you have any type of quote, mental illness.
[01:55:58.717 --> 01:56:01.679]  They're handing those out like dum-dums after you get your hair cut.
[01:56:02.039 --> 01:56:02.839]  I mean, this is bad.
[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:06.161]  It is a very, very serious situation.
[01:56:06.721 --> 01:56:10.223]  All it will take in the proposed Schumer-McCarthy bill
[01:56:11.085 --> 01:56:21.592]  is for a psychiatrist to render a diagnosis that says that there's any chance, really any chance, that you might be a danger to self or others.
[01:56:22.153 --> 01:56:29.578]  So if they want to, they've apparently got the opinion that everybody with PTSD is such a danger.
[01:56:29.618 --> 01:56:35.662]  Well that's a crock because we have the statistics on that population now ever since Vietnam.
[01:56:36.303 --> 01:56:42.949]  A whole bunch of those folks, and in fact they have the same, they don't have any worse crime record than anybody else.
[01:56:43.049 --> 01:56:44.591]  And Larry, am I disagreeing with you?
[01:56:44.611 --> 01:56:50.596]  That's a good point, but a lot of doctors say that's all quackery, it doesn't even exist to begin with.
[01:56:51.036 --> 01:56:59.544]  I mean, that's why we've been saying if somebody should be barred from guns, take them to court and prove they've committed a crime.
[01:57:00.114 --> 01:57:00.814]  Take him to court.
[01:57:01.135 --> 01:57:02.916]  Don't just let somebody give an opinion.
[01:57:02.976 --> 01:57:04.036]  It's unrebutted.
[01:57:04.697 --> 01:57:06.098]  No challenge to it.
[01:57:06.238 --> 01:57:12.681]  And don't use the excuse of this shooter up in Virginia Tech in Blacksburg because that was a gun ban zone.
[01:57:12.721 --> 01:57:21.447]  I mean, let me tell you, when I was in college, I didn't live on a college and I wouldn't have had because I couldn't have a gun, but somebody shooting somebody in my apartment complex, I'm going to kill them.
[01:57:22.487 --> 01:57:24.148]  And that's how it works down here in Texas.
[01:57:24.168 --> 01:57:25.269]  We don't have too much of this stuff.
[01:57:26.349 --> 01:57:27.631]  Uh, it's unbelievable.
[01:57:27.651 --> 01:57:28.633]  Stay there, Larry Pratt.
[01:57:28.653 --> 01:57:29.193]  We'll come back.
[01:57:29.514 --> 01:57:31.336]  Talk about the new gun control bills they're launching.
[01:57:32.959 --> 01:57:37.845]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.056 --> 01:57:49.696]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.357 --> 01:57:51.417]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.138 --> 01:57:53.258]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.878 --> 01:57:54.719]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.459 --> 01:57:56.340]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:00.702]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.222 --> 01:58:05.264]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:18.045]  Live from deep in the heart of Texas, literally in the geographical dead center of the great state, blasting out across this wonderful land, formerly land of the free and home of the brave.
[01:58:18.065 --> 01:58:20.626]  We're trying to resurrect that and across the wonderful planet.
[01:58:20.646 --> 01:58:24.027]  I want to say hi to everybody listening across the globe and all the ships at sea.
[01:58:25.368 --> 01:58:28.389]  Donald's segment with Larry Pratt and it has blasted past us.
[01:58:29.070 --> 01:58:32.311]  The NRA again is supporting draconian legislation.
[01:58:33.098 --> 01:58:40.321]  The average gun owner is neutralized, thinking that they are their friends when they are the fathers of gun control, victim disarmament in this country.
[01:58:40.962 --> 01:58:43.603]  Again, which people believe is the exact opposite of reality.
[01:58:43.883 --> 01:58:51.927]  Larry Pratt, Head of Gunners of America, who we're begging people to join and help, or at least get their free email alerts and lobby and call yourself and help.
[01:58:52.727 --> 01:58:56.689]  Tell folks about these horrible new attacks on the Second Amendment we face.
[01:58:57.481 --> 01:59:07.856]  Well, the Veterans Disarmament Bill is our rename of the improvement on the National Criminal Information Center system.
[01:59:09.058 --> 01:59:13.645]  And it does a lot more than just hit veterans, but the reason we picked on that was
[01:59:14.205 --> 01:59:17.786]  Because they are already being abused in the system.
[01:59:17.826 --> 01:59:22.408]  They don't await passage of this law to be further included.
[01:59:22.628 --> 01:59:24.468]  Although more veterans will get thrown into it.
[01:59:24.488 --> 01:59:25.729]  That's right.
[01:59:25.769 --> 01:59:28.649]  Clinton dumped tens of thousands of vets' names.
[01:59:28.689 --> 01:59:30.690]  You had crooked toenails into it.
[01:59:31.010 --> 01:59:31.590]  Exactly right.
[01:59:32.651 --> 01:59:39.973]  From everything we can tell, it was enough to have a PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, and you were toast.
[01:59:40.413 --> 01:59:47.737]  And these are people that have had careers, raised families, have concealed carry permits, which means the government couldn't find anything on them.
[01:59:48.718 --> 01:59:51.379]  They were able to prove themselves not guilty, if you will.
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:59.224]  And now we're going to reward them for having put their lives on the line and say, well, you can't have a gun anymore.
[02:00:00.004 --> 02:00:00.625]  It's just crazy.
[02:00:00.665 --> 02:00:04.667]  But there's more cops who've got ADHD or anything or it's over for them.
[02:00:04.828 --> 02:00:07.429]  Well, cops get PTSD many times.
[02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:17.997]  Usually people that have been in a combat situation, be it in the military or a police, frequently experience flashbacks and different kinds of
[02:00:18.657 --> 02:00:20.279]  Well, they deal with it and they get over it.
[02:00:20.339 --> 02:00:30.748]  I know people in my church that have suffered from PTSD and they're just great people and they've never hurt anybody that didn't need hurting anyone.
[02:00:31.489 --> 02:00:32.390]  They were in the military.
[02:00:32.670 --> 02:00:40.377]  But, you know, it's not the kind of thing that warrants even talking about them being put into jeopardy.
[02:00:40.437 --> 02:00:42.299]  Instead of talking about more gun control,
[02:00:42.779 --> 02:00:49.541]  We ought to be talking about getting rid of the victim zones that have been created by the gun-free school zones.
[02:00:50.201 --> 02:00:51.321]  That's the non-specific problem.
[02:00:51.341 --> 02:00:53.082]  Larry, where is this evil bill?
[02:00:53.142 --> 02:00:55.042]  You were telling me last week it was very close to passage.
[02:00:55.322 --> 02:01:06.005]  It whipped through the House, it almost whipped through the Senate, and happily, Senator Tom Coburn jumped into the gap, and he has set up a series of parliamentary stratagems
[02:01:07.985 --> 02:01:15.487]  Well, Larry, I appreciate all your time.
[02:01:15.507 --> 02:01:19.648]  I want to get you back up to do more of the history of the treacherous, treasonous NRA.
[02:01:20.008 --> 02:01:28.050]  I want to get you back up to educate, but also talk about strategies to craft bills that will reverse gun control and put them on the defensive.
[02:01:28.110 --> 02:01:29.050]  Gunowners.org.
[02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:33.872]  Go there, sign up for the free email legislative alerts.
[02:01:33.892 --> 02:01:35.292]  The NRA will not warn you.
[02:01:35.553 --> 02:01:37.153]  They will tell you gun control is good.
[02:01:37.193 --> 02:01:41.576]  They'll tell you they're fighting gun control as they support victim disarmament and enslavement.
[02:01:41.876 --> 02:01:43.757]  If the Second Amendment falls, it all falls.
[02:01:43.837 --> 02:01:45.017]  GunOwners.org.
[02:01:45.397 --> 02:01:50.360]  And for heaven's sakes, they need money to start a YouTube channel and a weekly TV report and some other things.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:51.921]  Become a member.
[02:01:52.281 --> 02:01:58.164]  I mean, go get a $20 a year membership or get a lifetime membership and get in that number again, Larry.
[02:01:58.484 --> 02:02:01.986]  The phone number is 888-886-GUNS or just go to GunOwners.org.
[02:02:07.737 --> 02:02:08.718]  Absolutely so.
[02:02:10.258 --> 02:02:13.120]  8886guns.org.
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:17.102]  And we've all got this beaten down attitude like we can't win.
[02:02:17.502 --> 02:02:20.104]  That's because we have a Trojan horse, the NRA.
[02:02:20.244 --> 02:02:27.948]  And I'm going to be writing an article up with Paul Watson and Steve Watson in the next week or so, detailing this whole interview with documents and quotes and links.
[02:02:28.468 --> 02:02:32.331]  And I hope everybody gets it out to folks, because it's time to admit the problem.
[02:02:32.391 --> 02:02:34.652]  It's the NRA, not the members, the leadership.
[02:02:34.873 --> 02:02:37.454]  Larry Pratt, we salute you for your defense of this country.
[02:02:37.795 --> 02:02:39.716]  Oh, thank you very much for having me on, Alex.
[02:02:40.016 --> 02:02:41.817]  God bless you, sir, for your great research.
[02:02:42.197 --> 02:02:42.818]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.089 --> 02:02:50.050]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:55.792]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:02:55.832 --> 02:03:00.133]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:03:00.473 --> 02:03:03.474]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:03:03.794 --> 02:03:07.215]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:03:07.555 --> 02:03:16.902]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:03:17.163 --> 02:03:20.665]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:03:20.905 --> 02:03:28.011]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:03:28.271 --> 02:03:29.632]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.
[02:03:30.712 --> 02:03:35.974]  Get two for $70.00 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:03:47.393 --> 02:03:52.858]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.218 --> 02:04:00.845]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:01.559 --> 02:04:08.602]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.002 --> 02:04:20.407]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:20.727 --> 02:04:24.329]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:24.689 --> 02:04:26.630]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:26.970 --> 02:04:30.812]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.013 --> 02:04:44.553]  Hey Emily!
[02:04:44.834 --> 02:04:45.694]  Wow, you look great!
[02:04:45.914 --> 02:04:46.735]  I feel great!
[02:04:46.975 --> 02:04:48.757]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[02:04:49.037 --> 02:04:49.357]  Really?
[02:04:49.577 --> 02:04:49.977]  What is it?
[02:04:50.198 --> 02:04:50.678]  How does it work?
[02:04:50.858 --> 02:04:57.463]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[02:04:57.603 --> 02:04:59.885]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[02:05:00.105 --> 02:05:05.409]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you!
[02:05:05.749 --> 02:05:06.230]  That's it?
[02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:08.032]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[02:05:08.292 --> 02:05:08.993]  It is easy.
[02:05:09.213 --> 02:05:15.920]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[02:05:16.201 --> 02:05:17.722]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:18.723]  That's amazing!
[02:05:19.144 --> 02:05:24.510]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:25.130]  Wow!
[02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:26.450]  Where can I buy a MediCleanse?
[02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:29.571]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[02:05:29.671 --> 02:05:32.852]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[02:05:32.992 --> 02:05:36.413]  For only $22.95 plus shipping, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[02:05:36.593 --> 02:05:37.193]  Or call them at 1-800-317-9547.
[02:05:37.213 --> 02:05:37.433]  That's 1-800-317-9547.
[02:05:37.453 --> 02:05:37.733]  Call today.
[02:05:37.853 --> 02:05:40.234]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.851 --> 02:05:58.513]  Alright, I promised to play some excerpts of Ron Paul in the debate last night.
[02:05:59.494 --> 02:06:03.535]  He was given, when we've done this repeatedly, he was given the shortest amount of time of any of the candidates.
[02:06:03.575 --> 02:06:07.957]  They let Mitt Romney and others go on for, they let Fred Thompson go on for 15 minutes.
[02:06:08.477 --> 02:06:10.037]  Ron Paul got four and a half minutes.
[02:06:11.398 --> 02:06:15.840]  So, here it is, ladies and gentlemen, Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:21.842]  Then we're going to get into some of the economic news that has been
[02:06:23.648 --> 02:06:25.189]  Coming out in the last few days.
[02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:31.933]  The dollar continues its slide, and there's discussion by central bank heads of it going down another 15% by next year.
[02:06:32.013 --> 02:06:37.676]  I mean, this is pulling your hair out crazy, and we still can't get the general public to understand what this means.
[02:06:38.316 --> 02:06:48.221]  So, I'm going to get into that, and then we've got a top-level expert on international law and torture coming on the broadcast as well, Francis Boyle.
[02:06:48.741 --> 02:06:49.882]  So, stay with us.
[02:06:50.042 --> 02:06:51.763]  Here he is, Ron Paul, last night.
[02:06:52.606 --> 02:06:53.427]  On Middle East oil?
[02:06:55.708 --> 02:06:58.530]  Probably not, but that should not be a reason.
[02:06:58.590 --> 02:07:00.311]  That's an old theory.
[02:07:00.411 --> 02:07:01.532]  It's mercantilistic.
[02:07:01.592 --> 02:07:07.195]  It's neo-colonialism that you have to maintain your supply routes and your natural resources.
[02:07:07.676 --> 02:07:17.942]  But I think there's still a lot of those kind of people around, and they believe, you know, we were told it was about oil and jobs when it first started in 1990, and this is just a continuation of that war.
[02:07:18.362 --> 02:07:20.764]  Indeed, this war is a mistake.
[02:07:21.044 --> 02:07:21.504]  We're good to go.
[02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:40.451]  We're good to go.
[02:08:00.194 --> 02:08:03.876]  We create money out of thin air, and they still accept it as if it was backed by gold.
[02:08:04.296 --> 02:08:13.359]  And that is the reason all this money goes overseas, and at the same time we finance all this military activity overseas, it's bankrupting this country.
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:20.642]  And not only that, it's a threat to our personal liberties here, and it's going to be a threat to our economy, because we are beginning to live beneath our means.
[02:08:20.942 --> 02:08:25.324]  And that is a natural consequence of what happens when you live beyond your means.
[02:08:25.644 --> 02:08:26.685]  So we must
[02:08:27.125 --> 02:08:27.405]  Absolutely.
[02:08:27.565 --> 02:08:31.049]  This idea of going and talking to attorneys totally baffles me.
[02:08:42.142 --> 02:08:45.264]  Why don't we just open up the Constitution and read it?
[02:08:45.504 --> 02:08:48.186]  You're not allowed to go to war without a declaration of war.
[02:08:48.547 --> 02:08:55.572]  Now, as far as fleeting enemies go, yes, if there's an imminent attack on us, we've never had that happen in 220 years.
[02:08:55.932 --> 02:09:01.996]  The thought that the Iranians could pose an imminent attack on the United States is preposterous.
[02:09:02.016 --> 02:09:02.577]  There's no way.
[02:09:05.098 --> 02:09:07.639]  This is just war propaganda.
[02:09:07.679 --> 02:09:09.140]  Continuing war propaganda.
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:12.201]  Preparing this nation to go to war and spread this war.
[02:09:12.461 --> 02:09:14.041]  Not only in Iraq, but in Tehran.
[02:09:14.461 --> 02:09:15.602]  Unconstitutionally.
[02:09:16.082 --> 02:09:19.403]  It is a road to disaster for us as a nation.
[02:09:19.463 --> 02:09:23.404]  It's a road to our financial disaster if we don't read the Constitution once in a while.
[02:09:23.424 --> 02:09:24.465]  Around the horn, Congressman.
[02:09:24.545 --> 02:09:25.625]  And moral values.
[02:09:25.705 --> 02:09:30.527]  But polls also show that voters look, now at least, to the Democrats to handle the economy.
[02:09:30.867 --> 02:09:33.128]  How are you going to win back their confidence in order?
[02:09:33.188 --> 02:09:33.788]  Congressman Paul.
[02:09:34.631 --> 02:09:36.852]  Well, first we have to have a sound economy and we don't.
[02:09:36.872 --> 02:09:37.912]  We're overtaxed.
[02:09:38.393 --> 02:09:39.533]  We're overregulated.
[02:09:39.573 --> 02:09:41.694]  We work with a currency that is non-functional.
[02:09:42.454 --> 02:09:45.635]  And our prosperity is slipping.
[02:09:46.416 --> 02:09:48.456]  And we are overextended overseas.
[02:09:48.496 --> 02:09:52.178]  You can't have a prosperous economy at home when you're spending all the money overseas.
[02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:57.582]  You can't even have a strong national defense if you're spending all this money overseas in wars that we're not winning.
[02:09:57.662 --> 02:10:07.330]  So if we want a prosperous economy here, we have to change these policies and we can't be bailing out farmers and subsidizing ethanol.
[02:10:07.530 --> 02:10:09.691]  This is just the wrong way to go.
[02:10:09.751 --> 02:10:15.356]  The taxpayers pay for the subsidies and then they pay for higher prices when they buy the gasoline or buy the food.
[02:10:15.456 --> 02:10:16.156]  It never works.
[02:10:16.437 --> 02:10:16.717]  Governor?
[02:10:18.255 --> 02:10:22.857]  The right to unionize should be a basic right of any person.
[02:10:22.877 --> 02:10:23.938]  You should be able to organize.
[02:10:23.978 --> 02:10:37.503]  You should have no privileges, no special benefits legislated to benefit the unions, but you should never deny any working group to organize and negotiate for the best set of standards of working conditions.
[02:10:37.643 --> 02:10:37.943]  Governor?
[02:10:38.844 --> 02:10:41.925]  I'm asked to support the nominee of the Republican Party next year.
[02:10:43.178 --> 02:10:44.220]  Not right now, I don't.
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:47.945]  Not unless they're willing to end the war and bring our troops home.
[02:10:48.345 --> 02:10:51.209]  And not unless they're willing to look at the excessive spending.
[02:10:51.229 --> 02:10:58.179]  No, I'm not going to support them if they continue down the path which has taken our party down the tubes.
[02:10:58.579 --> 02:11:08.506]  I mean, we've lost credibility because of all our spending, because we have violated the civil liberties of all the American people, and we have adopted the Democrats' foreign policy.
[02:11:08.806 --> 02:11:15.891]  Why don't we run on George Bush's foreign policy of a humble foreign policy and no nation building, and don't police the world?
[02:11:15.991 --> 02:11:17.112]  Then I'll support that.
[02:11:17.252 --> 02:11:25.818]  You can watch the full clip up on presentplanet.com, we've got links to it, of the excerpts, but the bigger issue here
[02:11:27.572 --> 02:11:34.596]  Is that USA Today did a national poll of who Republicans hate the most, and guess who it is?
[02:11:35.257 --> 02:11:36.237]  It's Ron Paul.
[02:11:38.399 --> 02:11:38.939]  Ron Paul.
[02:11:38.959 --> 02:11:39.900]  They hate Ron Paul.
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:41.801]  You see, party hacks.
[02:11:41.841 --> 02:11:42.921]  Republican Party members.
[02:11:45.083 --> 02:11:46.424]  They love gun control.
[02:11:46.484 --> 02:11:47.684]  They love open borders.
[02:11:47.784 --> 02:11:51.206]  They love tripling the size of the government and the BATF.
[02:11:51.246 --> 02:11:52.567]  They love the New World Order.
[02:11:53.188 --> 02:11:55.189]  I mean, you go to local Republican meetings,
[02:11:56.261 --> 02:12:04.667]  It's these fake party hacks with the big hair and the makeup and strutting around in suits and they'll snicker and giggle and you'll find out they're all Democratic Party operatives.
[02:12:06.047 --> 02:12:08.509]  It's a big joke how they've destroyed this country.
[02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:15.353]  And they snicker and they laugh and they grovel whenever Republicans show up.
[02:12:15.373 --> 02:12:17.135]  I've been to Ron Paul meetings too.
[02:12:17.155 --> 02:12:18.455]  They're even trying to infiltrate that.
[02:12:19.476 --> 02:12:21.938]  And they're just these fake little pathetic posers.
[02:12:23.339 --> 02:12:23.919]  And they're everywhere.
[02:12:25.336 --> 02:12:27.938]  All right, shifted gears, I want to spend a few minutes on the economy.
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:35.084]  And Ted Anderson has been watching this for 20 plus years.
[02:12:35.125 --> 02:12:38.107]  He's been a gold and metals trader for 20 plus years.
[02:12:40.129 --> 02:12:42.811]  He's had, what, minus resources for more than 10 years.
[02:12:44.232 --> 02:12:46.815]  And I thought I'd get Ted on here to give his view on this.
[02:12:46.835 --> 02:12:48.996]  But it's not, the whole world's talking like Ted now.
[02:12:49.056 --> 02:12:51.278]  I mean, it's not just Ron Paul and Ted and others.
[02:12:53.777 --> 02:12:57.939]  They're talking about next year, the dollar even going down more, and it's still sliding right now, Ted.
[02:12:57.979 --> 02:12:59.059]  Where is all this going?
[02:12:59.439 --> 02:13:07.542]  Well, you know, Alex, when you asked me to come up, I just thought I'd go into Google and type in the following dollar.
[02:13:07.583 --> 02:13:11.944]  And story after story, I mean, BBC has a big one out here that's talking about the year 2006.
[02:13:14.145 --> 02:13:22.549]  The trade deficit expanded past 800 billion dollars, 7% higher than it was before, faster than the U.S.
[02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:23.489]  economy has grown.
[02:13:24.510 --> 02:13:28.491]  The deficit is going out of handle because of this war that we're in in Iraq.
[02:13:28.851 --> 02:13:30.012]  It's just killing the dollar.
[02:13:30.032 --> 02:13:31.112]  I mean literally killing it.
[02:13:31.132 --> 02:13:32.633]  Everybody's seeing that happening right now.
[02:13:33.053 --> 02:13:35.874]  Alan Greenspan is out there spouting off again.
[02:13:35.894 --> 02:13:39.236]  Reuters has a story on him, the credit crunch.
[02:13:40.156 --> 02:13:42.457]  Is going to take a toll on the economy, is the headline.
[02:13:42.477 --> 02:13:50.400]  I mean, this is about... Now notice, notice, they're all piling on saying bad things about the economy, trying to drive it down so they can consolidate.
[02:13:50.721 --> 02:13:52.421]  Well, that's exactly what's going on.
[02:13:52.461 --> 02:13:54.542]  It's a push for the for the Amaro.
[02:13:55.443 --> 02:14:00.965]  If we've now lost the purchasing power, our dollar became less valuable than the Canadian.
[02:14:01.485 --> 02:14:09.349]  I mean, if it drops below the Mexican peso, then we're going to think it's a good idea to join forces with these guys.
[02:14:09.389 --> 02:14:11.289]  Yeah, yuppies don't even know what that means, though.
[02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:12.310]  They just know how to act cool.
[02:14:12.690 --> 02:14:17.932]  Ted, I mean, we are in a red-level crisis here, and there are ways.
[02:14:18.012 --> 02:14:19.773]  People could have listened in 2000 and got gold at 320 an ounce.
[02:14:21.874 --> 02:14:24.937]  You've got gold again at the price a couple weeks ago.
[02:14:25.277 --> 02:14:29.201]  You've got precious coins with collector value.
[02:14:29.561 --> 02:14:32.464]  At the price I'm hearing other people sell bullion.
[02:14:33.124 --> 02:14:34.526]  These are gorgeous coins.
[02:14:34.686 --> 02:14:36.928]  You've got British quarter-ounce sovereigns.
[02:14:37.668 --> 02:14:38.969]  And you've got something special.
[02:14:38.989 --> 02:14:41.631]  You did get a bunch of silver dollars in.
[02:14:42.092 --> 02:14:43.953]  I just got some from you Friday.
[02:14:44.814 --> 02:14:49.237]  Folks, silver has not made the big move versus the drop of the dollar yet.
[02:14:49.538 --> 02:14:50.198]  It will.
[02:14:50.258 --> 02:14:51.459]  You can be assured of that.
[02:14:51.479 --> 02:14:53.561]  So you can still get a steal on silver.
[02:14:54.141 --> 02:14:55.462]  Ted, tell them about those deals.
[02:14:55.602 --> 02:14:56.002]  Oh, yeah.
[02:14:56.022 --> 02:14:57.784]  Well, let's talk about the silver dollars first.
[02:14:57.824 --> 02:15:00.326]  First of all, the above ground silver supply is just about
[02:15:01.066 --> 02:15:05.829]  Exempt or gone because the silver mines had to close down when silver prices were low.
[02:15:06.189 --> 02:15:12.372]  They don't have them all up and operational yet to replenish the supply and it's an industrial metal and an economic metal.
[02:15:12.412 --> 02:15:18.695]  So obviously, I mean here in the United States people have been using silver dollars as money going all the way back to the 1700s.
[02:15:18.735 --> 02:15:23.378]  It's a very good thing to have in your portfolio and people recognize them.
[02:15:23.418 --> 02:15:26.219]  They are trading for $360 per roll of 20.
[02:15:26.279 --> 02:15:29.401]  The good reason for those two Alex's is that
[02:15:30.461 --> 02:15:32.582]  You don't have to be a rich man to own these things.
[02:15:32.602 --> 02:15:34.022]  They're about 18 bucks a piece.
[02:15:34.442 --> 02:15:37.603]  People are paying that down at Baker Square for a dinner.
[02:15:39.184 --> 02:15:41.785]  You simply better start preparing yourself.
[02:15:41.965 --> 02:15:43.125]  One of the ways to do it is that.
[02:15:43.165 --> 02:15:46.006]  That's a good way to get involved with a small amount of money.
[02:15:46.046 --> 02:15:48.287]  Even if you want to do a whole bunch of them, that's a good idea.
[02:15:48.787 --> 02:15:51.047]  The other thing we're talking about is the British Sovereign coin.
[02:15:51.067 --> 02:15:52.268]  It's a quarter ounce gold coin.
[02:15:52.288 --> 02:15:53.988]  You just can't go wrong with it.
[02:15:54.088 --> 02:15:54.669]  It's $206.
[02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:57.049]  It's a nationally recognized coin.
[02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:59.410]  It's recognized around the entire planet.
[02:15:59.930 --> 02:16:08.291]  If you have this coin in your hand, and I can drop you anywhere in the world, that coin will buy you the things that you need to have any time in the future.
[02:16:08.311 --> 02:16:08.892]  You need to have it.
[02:16:08.952 --> 02:16:11.352]  Yeah, folks, gold isn't going up.
[02:16:11.432 --> 02:16:12.752]  The dollar's going down.
[02:16:13.292 --> 02:16:14.333]  Oil isn't going up.
[02:16:14.433 --> 02:16:15.873]  The dollar is going down.
[02:16:16.653 --> 02:16:18.573]  It isn't that they're deporting the illegals.
[02:16:18.613 --> 02:16:19.173]  They haven't.
[02:16:19.573 --> 02:16:23.174]  I mean, can you believe they're on the news saying food is up because the illegals aren't here?
[02:16:23.674 --> 02:16:24.754]  I mean, that is ridiculous.
[02:16:24.794 --> 02:16:28.495]  Folks, the actual government numbers admit it is the plunging dollar.
[02:16:28.975 --> 02:16:30.756]  But that's how they spin everything.
[02:16:31.136 --> 02:16:33.537]  They create the crisis and offer a fake solution.
[02:16:33.557 --> 02:16:36.378]  30 million illegals isn't enough to pick the strawberries.
[02:16:36.979 --> 02:16:42.221]  You can call Ted, call his brokers, and you can get a great deal on gold.
[02:16:42.241 --> 02:16:43.321]  They have this in hand.
[02:16:43.341 --> 02:16:45.022]  A lot of places are sold out right now.
[02:16:45.322 --> 02:16:47.463]  Give them the number, Ted.
[02:16:47.703 --> 02:16:49.704]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:16:49.724 --> 02:16:50.945]  What you're saying is right, Alex.
[02:16:51.025 --> 02:16:53.326]  It's getting very difficult to hold supply right now.
[02:16:54.206 --> 02:16:56.526]  1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-22
[02:17:23.132 --> 02:17:29.518]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.com and we've got links to Ted's website right there where you can find similar deals.
[02:17:29.538 --> 02:17:32.861]  Just tell them Alex Jones sent you 800-686-2237.
[02:17:32.901 --> 02:17:34.923]  Thank you for coming on, Ted.
[02:17:34.943 --> 02:17:38.506]  We're going to come back and talk about some other really important issues on the other side.
[02:17:38.547 --> 02:17:39.968]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:45.003 --> 02:17:49.608]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[02:18:37.532 --> 02:18:47.501]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:47.901 --> 02:18:53.385]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:53.946 --> 02:18:54.446]  That's right.
[02:18:54.767 --> 02:18:57.409]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:57.609 --> 02:19:04.535]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:05.077 --> 02:19:12.782]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:13.222 --> 02:19:18.085]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:18.706 --> 02:19:21.727]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:28.632]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:29.012 --> 02:19:29.253]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:29.273 --> 02:19:31.214]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:31.274 --> 02:19:31.594]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:31.875 --> 02:19:32.155]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:47.823]  Yes, there is an In-Dash AM-FM shortwave radio.

[02:20:28.377 --> 02:20:31.339]  These radios are not available anywhere else and for a limited time.

[02:20:32.439 --> 02:20:32.679]  Call 877-817-9829.

[02:20:44.622 --> 02:20:46.444]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:46.604 --> 02:20:51.789]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:20:51.949 --> 02:20:53.290]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:53.571 --> 02:21:01.738]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:21:01.958 --> 02:21:07.684]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:21:07.844 --> 02:21:09.625]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:21:09.706 --> 02:21:11.867]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:21:12.007 --> 02:21:16.271]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:21:16.411 --> 02:21:18.573]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:21:18.633 --> 02:21:26.399]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:21:26.459 --> 02:21:27.320]  We're good to go.
[02:21:47.896 --> 02:21:48.396]  Don't worry.
[02:21:48.856 --> 02:21:50.437]  This show is documented.
[02:21:50.877 --> 02:21:53.739]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.059 --> 02:21:57.560]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:05.944]  I still hear establishment worshippers snickering and snorting about gold.
[02:22:06.024 --> 02:22:07.145]  So funny to them.
[02:22:07.725 --> 02:22:09.666]  And they just are enamored with the stock market.
[02:22:09.746 --> 02:22:09.966]  It's at 14,000!
[02:22:10.166 --> 02:22:14.288]  Oh my gosh, it's heaven!
[02:22:14.968 --> 02:22:16.369]  And the stock market at
[02:22:18.875 --> 02:22:20.976]  2,000 levels, is it really 6,720?
[02:22:21.016 --> 02:22:30.562]  That dollar value versus the year 2000, versus the Euro, it is at 6,720.
[02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:32.644]  Let me explain that.
[02:22:33.104 --> 02:22:38.788]  If you took the amount of inflation of our currency,
[02:22:39.913 --> 02:22:57.342]  And then you removed that, and the dollar was worth what it was in early 2000, the stock market with that dollar that you had in 2000, you would be able to buy up the whole stock market at 6,720 points.
[02:22:59.623 --> 02:23:00.244]  It's real simple.
[02:23:00.704 --> 02:23:04.806]  But I mean, I talked to the mainline folks, like they've been pre-programmed to not be able to understand it.
[02:23:05.766 --> 02:23:08.628]  The dollar isn't worth as much oil
[02:23:10.072 --> 02:23:20.401]  Food, housing, gold, stocks are going to cost more.
[02:23:21.382 --> 02:23:26.226]  So the reason the stock market is at $14,000 is because the dollar has lost 62% of its value.
[02:23:32.415 --> 02:23:37.316]  The stock market then is really at 6720 points.
[02:23:37.756 --> 02:23:54.180]  Now I know most of my audience literally, and I mean this is smarter than I am, I call you, I get emails from you, I know you're intelligent, I'm sorry if you hear me talk like that like I'm talking to a baby, but there are people driving around right now in Lexuses, or they're driving around in police cars, and they just don't, they just
[02:23:54.930 --> 02:23:56.951]  All they know how to say is, we must kill Al-Qaeda.
[02:23:56.971 --> 02:23:58.832]  They just literally repeat it over and over again.
[02:23:59.092 --> 02:24:01.413]  They don't know Al-Qaeda's admitted CIA created.
[02:24:01.433 --> 02:24:07.597]  I got stacks of news today where the Turkish government, our ally, they let us put nukes in Turkey before.
[02:24:07.897 --> 02:24:08.777]  Well, you know, with the Russians.
[02:24:10.958 --> 02:24:16.461]  Our saying, our government's funding terror groups inside Turkey to try to overthrow the government.
[02:24:16.521 --> 02:24:20.203]  I mean, and of course it's Wahhabi terrorist as usual.
[02:24:21.104 --> 02:24:21.324]  I mean,
[02:24:23.098 --> 02:24:24.799]  That's the Saudi Arabian variety.
[02:24:24.979 --> 02:24:26.119]  They work for the globalists.
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:28.480]  The British set them up, of course they do.
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:31.581]  This is history, and I just can't even communicate with you.
[02:24:31.841 --> 02:24:33.482]  I don't understand why you're so dumb.
[02:24:34.242 --> 02:24:35.103]  I know you're not dumb.
[02:24:35.123 --> 02:24:44.086]  You know how to, you know, go at the country club, make money as a broker, whatever you do, but you don't know about basic... You willfully don't want to know.
[02:24:45.326 --> 02:24:49.068]  And if you just wake up, the globalists would get scared off and back off what they're doing.
[02:24:49.808 --> 02:24:52.209]  But instead, you're taking the bait.
[02:24:53.391 --> 02:24:54.092]  Yeah!
[02:24:54.552 --> 02:24:56.694]  All you people wanted the illegals out!
[02:24:56.734 --> 02:24:58.496]  That's why food prices are up!
[02:25:00.758 --> 02:25:03.660]  And they swagger around with a very official look in their eyes.
[02:25:06.523 --> 02:25:08.164]  Or they talk about, look at the stock market!
[02:25:08.184 --> 02:25:09.065]  Look at that beauty!
[02:25:09.125 --> 02:25:09.605]  Yeah!
[02:25:09.645 --> 02:25:10.786]  But the market's up!
[02:25:12.128 --> 02:25:13.669]  What can't you understand?
[02:25:14.890 --> 02:25:16.631]  What is your major malfunction?
[02:25:16.752 --> 02:25:19.414]  What is your problem?
[02:25:22.193 --> 02:25:23.994]  What is wrong with you?
[02:25:27.596 --> 02:25:28.657]  I mean, seriously!
[02:25:29.578 --> 02:25:36.302]  I've been on airplanes, I've been at gun shops, I've been at the gym, and had arguments with good ol' boys.
[02:25:36.362 --> 02:25:38.703]  I'll say, oh, I see you walking in, you got an NRA sticker.
[02:25:39.304 --> 02:25:42.766]  Did you know the NRA actually helped push the gun control in this country?
[02:25:43.186 --> 02:25:44.507]  Whatever, you're nuts.
[02:25:44.607 --> 02:25:45.748]  What are you, are you joking, man?
[02:25:46.128 --> 02:25:47.889]  What are you, some kind of liberal, making a joke?
[02:25:48.484 --> 02:25:52.985]  And I'm like, no, really, uh, I know I'm not saying you're bad, they fooled you.
[02:25:53.005 --> 02:25:56.585]  Now I have a duty, I talk to people with NRA stickers.
[02:25:57.866 --> 02:26:04.747]  My wife gets mad that I don't do it anymore with her in the car, but I'll roll the window down and go, hey buddy, did you know you ought to join gun owners or JPFO?
[02:26:05.947 --> 02:26:11.828]  That's not a real, and they'll just, whatever, man.
[02:26:12.188 --> 02:26:13.248]  I mean, why?
[02:26:13.268 --> 02:26:16.649]  I mean, why don't you want to save our precious Second Amendment?
[02:26:16.969 --> 02:26:17.849]  Prove me a liar!
[02:26:19.068 --> 02:26:21.469]  Go research what Larry Pratt just told you in the last hour.
[02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:31.632]  I mean, if we could wake you up, we could blame the Federal Reserve for what's happening, they would have to back off, as Ron Paul has said.
[02:26:31.812 --> 02:26:32.852]  We're not going to, though.
[02:26:32.872 --> 02:26:37.054]  And let me tell you, when we're in a hardcore depression, you'll realize why I've been so upset.
[02:26:37.754 --> 02:26:39.014]  Just remember that.
[02:26:39.714 --> 02:26:44.876]  You may figure it out, but you'll hear what the talking heads say is causing it then, and you'll just parrot that at me.
[02:26:45.666 --> 02:26:49.267]  Because you think if you pair it with somebody set off television, you're real smart!
[02:26:49.868 --> 02:26:51.328]  And I'm telling you, you're not!
[02:26:52.169 --> 02:26:54.890]  You're smart at fooling yourself, and that's about it.
[02:26:56.090 --> 02:26:57.911]  You're smart at not living in the real world.
[02:26:58.251 --> 02:27:01.372]  I just don't understand why you like being played, like being conned.
[02:27:01.452 --> 02:27:02.612]  I just can't get over it!
[02:27:02.993 --> 02:27:04.053]  I hate being played!
[02:27:04.353 --> 02:27:05.934]  I hate not knowing how stuff works!
[02:27:06.274 --> 02:27:07.354]  I hate being conned!
[02:27:08.155 --> 02:27:08.955]  I hate losing!
[02:27:09.915 --> 02:27:15.417]  I hate having a bunch of foreign bankers ruin my country and overrun us with a bunch of America-hating foreigners.
[02:27:16.157 --> 02:27:17.677]  You think it's cute.
[02:27:18.318 --> 02:27:24.440]  Or even if you know about it, you'll tell me, yeah, but I like George W. George W. doesn't run anything.
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:28.021]  He doesn't run anything but his gay whores.
[02:27:28.961 --> 02:27:29.761]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.283 --> 02:27:36.243]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.663 --> 02:27:38.184]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.185 --> 02:27:41.987]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:27:47.211 --> 02:27:50.573]  If it happens, you want to be ready to give your loved ones a fighting chance.
[02:27:50.853 --> 02:27:55.297]  Do not rely on someone else to come through for you at a time when it could be about life and death.
[02:27:55.697 --> 02:28:00.660]  Your best chance is Safe Castle Royal, the premier crisis preparedness buyer's club out there.

[02:28:57.083 --> 02:28:57.764]  Here's why.
[02:28:58.164 --> 02:29:04.107]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:29:04.347 --> 02:29:10.349]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[02:29:10.570 --> 02:29:11.490]  But they're not cheating.
[02:29:11.730 --> 02:29:15.714]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[02:29:15.914 --> 02:29:20.259]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[02:29:20.359 --> 02:29:27.866]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.

[02:29:28.727 --> 02:29:29.288]  Get relief.

[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:50.364]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[02:29:50.825 --> 02:29:54.250]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[02:29:54.610 --> 02:30:01.700]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[02:30:02.040 --> 02:30:05.304]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[02:30:05.564 --> 02:30:09.428]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[02:30:09.769 --> 02:30:20.861]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[02:30:21.161 --> 02:30:25.463]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[02:30:25.683 --> 02:30:27.543]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[02:30:53.474 --> 02:31:00.516]  Well, Professor Boyle is a PhD in political science from Harvard University.
[02:31:01.176 --> 02:31:08.697]  He's literally written international weapons treaties, head lawyer for major governments, Amnesty International, on and on and on.
[02:31:08.717 --> 02:31:11.898]  And he's written a book.
[02:31:11.918 --> 02:31:12.718]  It's excellent.
[02:31:14.366 --> 02:31:15.687]  About bringing down the New World Order.
[02:31:15.727 --> 02:31:17.208]  We're going to talk to him in just a moment.
[02:31:17.468 --> 02:31:25.174]  I wanted to get him on about the war with Iran, what's happening in Israel, the news coming out that Bush signed a secret order ordering the torture.
[02:31:25.895 --> 02:31:28.697]  That really completes the circuit now, total proof.
[02:31:28.737 --> 02:31:32.440]  We already had his White House counsels writing up the famous torture memos.
[02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:35.202]  So I want to get his take on that here in just a moment.
[02:31:39.085 --> 02:31:41.867]  Before we go to our guest, I want to tell you about eFoods Direct.
[02:31:41.907 --> 02:31:50.654]  In these uncertain times, with talk of massive recession, depression, with talks of World War III, whatever, I've got scorable food.
[02:31:50.694 --> 02:31:51.955]  And this isn't because I live in fear.
[02:31:51.995 --> 02:31:53.517]  It's because I don't want to live in fear.
[02:31:54.177 --> 02:32:03.004]  I want to be confident that if there is some massive breakdown, or a hurricane, or earthquake, or whatever, I've got a couple-year supply of food, and I bought it from the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[02:32:03.405 --> 02:32:04.846]  About eight years ago, I got some.
[02:32:05.552 --> 02:32:09.254]  And then I got some again earlier this year, and they are a sponsor of this broadcast.
[02:32:09.634 --> 02:32:15.677]  The website is efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:15.737 --> 02:32:22.020]  The UN, our own government, talk about using food as a weapon.
[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:23.420]  Bush has talked about using it.
[02:32:23.440 --> 02:32:26.522]  The John Warren Defense Authorization Act talks about martial law.
[02:32:28.323 --> 02:32:30.884]  I don't know if they're going to pull it, but the point is you need to be prepared.
[02:32:31.824 --> 02:32:36.067]  Regardless, you can take the dollar being radically devalued, and if it totally plunges, you'll have food.
[02:32:36.087 --> 02:32:40.949]  And he would have cashed in some of those dollars to get very inexpensive, high-quality, affordable foods.
[02:32:41.370 --> 02:32:47.333]  Again, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:32:47.613 --> 02:32:52.116]  You can't miss their big banners on the top of PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:32:52.156 --> 02:32:56.339]  Now, his bio is so lengthy, his accomplishments so amazing, his courage so...
[02:32:58.183 --> 02:33:03.966]  You know, the gravitas of it is amazing, and we really appreciate him coming on the show.
[02:33:04.026 --> 02:33:09.629]  Last interview he did here got picked up by some magazines and newspapers, some of the largest, one of the largest in the country.
[02:33:10.329 --> 02:33:12.270]  But Francis Boyle joins us again.
[02:33:12.310 --> 02:33:16.292]  He's busy with classes today, so we won't have him long, but I appreciate you coming on with us, sir.
[02:33:16.913 --> 02:33:19.434]  Well, thank you very much for having me on, Alex.
[02:33:19.574 --> 02:33:21.015]  My best to your listening audience.
[02:33:21.575 --> 02:33:23.176]  So much is happening in the world, sir.
[02:33:23.236 --> 02:33:25.457]  With your expertise in international law and
[02:33:26.224 --> 02:33:35.911]  And in torture and tyranny and studying that and fighting it your whole life, can you give us the big view of where the world stands right now and then where the U.S.
[02:33:35.931 --> 02:33:36.992]  stands in that world?
[02:33:37.332 --> 02:33:46.799]  And then your response on this amazing revelation in the New York Times last week that what we already knew from the White House memos, but here it is confirmed, that Bush ordered all this.
[02:33:48.593 --> 02:33:57.495]  Well, in answer to your first question, I think the major problem now is what seems to be some type of military attack on Iran.
[02:33:58.796 --> 02:34:12.539]  It looks... ABC News reported that Bush has signed one of these covert action findings against Iran, and the reports seem to indicate that they're going to attack Iran.
[02:34:13.159 --> 02:34:15.160]  I still think we have some time to
[02:34:16.412 --> 02:34:17.213]  head that off.
[02:34:17.333 --> 02:34:20.475]  I think we have to do everything humanly possible to stop it.
[02:34:21.716 --> 02:34:28.741]  One, it could get completely out of control and that whole area over there in the Persian Gulf could simply blow up.
[02:34:29.381 --> 02:34:38.527]  And two, undoubtedly Bush will then use that as an excuse to further his police state tactics here in the United States.
[02:34:38.667 --> 02:34:39.288]  Exactly!
[02:34:39.308 --> 02:34:39.788]  That's the plan.
[02:34:39.808 --> 02:34:40.769]  Culminating in martial law.
[02:34:41.189 --> 02:34:42.290]  I'm sorry, go ahead, say that again.
[02:34:42.430 --> 02:34:44.992]  If not, at some point culminating in martial law.
[02:34:45.812 --> 02:34:58.725]  For example, if there is hostilities between the United States and Iran initiated by the Bush administration, let's suppose Iran responds with one of those silkworm missiles against a U.S.
[02:34:58.785 --> 02:35:06.993]  aircraft carrier in the Gulf and takes it out or a destroyer, Bush would ask for a formal declaration of war from Congress, which he would probably get.
[02:35:07.748 --> 02:35:12.390]  And at that point he would be, quote, a constitutional dictator, unquote.
[02:35:12.530 --> 02:35:22.913]  There's an entire title of the United States Code that gives the President dictatorial powers in time of a formally declared war.
[02:35:22.933 --> 02:35:31.096]  And he has methodically been exercising and preparing and funding the implementation of that, has he not, Doctor?
[02:35:31.116 --> 02:35:32.256]  That's correct.
[02:35:32.316 --> 02:35:35.117]  As a matter of fact, it's already been reported after
[02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:47.181]  September 11, 2001, he tried to get a formal declaration of war, and Congress refused to give it to him, and so they gave him a limited authorization to use military force under the War Powers Resolution.
[02:35:48.101 --> 02:35:55.548]  It's also clear in the first draft of the USA Patriot Act, that it was sitting on Ashcroft's desk before September 11,
[02:35:56.633 --> 02:36:05.975]  They had already had a provision in there to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, which is all that separates us from a police state.
[02:36:06.055 --> 02:36:18.658]  Namely, if you're detained, your lawyer can appear in court and demand that you be produced live in court to justify the detention and the conditions of detention, for example, such that
[02:36:19.298 --> 02:36:21.100]  You're being tortured or something like that.
[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:33.990]  So it's very clear that even before September 11, with that draft of the Patriot Act ready to go, they were contemplating setting up a police state, sure.
[02:36:34.871 --> 02:36:37.553]  And if there is a formal declaration of war,
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:48.408]  I mean, being in and out of the government at the highest level, watching all of us being an expert.
[02:36:48.428 --> 02:36:51.734]  I mean, I'm no expert, but as a layman I've studied this in great detail.
[02:36:52.466 --> 02:36:55.387]  And I've never seen such preparation for martial law.
[02:36:55.407 --> 02:36:57.548]  I've never seen such public PR.
[02:36:57.588 --> 02:37:02.250]  We later learned that, illegally, Tommy Franks had been on secret payroll, part of the fake reporters.
[02:37:03.871 --> 02:37:05.031]  I called out when I saw it.
[02:37:05.091 --> 02:37:08.252]  He would give the same speech on Fox, CNN, and magazines.
[02:37:08.652 --> 02:37:15.055]  Now, I'm not partisan, and I'm not a Republican or Democrat, but it's gonna be real sad, but it's what people want, and it will keep us safe.
[02:37:15.795 --> 02:37:19.977]  After the next attack, we're gonna set aside the Constitution for a military form of government.
[02:37:20.723 --> 02:37:40.752]  So, I mean, we see, and now the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says the President against insurrection and the American people, I mean, and even if Iran doesn't blow up some aircraft carriers with some cruise missiles, the globalists, the neocons, I mean, did you see that letter a week and a half ago by
[02:37:42.330 --> 02:37:50.632]  Former Senator Gary Hart, the big CFR muckety-muck, where he told Iran, hey, we staged, in no uncertain terms, he said, look, we've staged events before.
[02:37:51.112 --> 02:37:57.373]  Don't think the American people won't support an attack on you, because the historical question is, does the U.S.
[02:37:57.413 --> 02:37:59.033]  government engage in provocations?
[02:37:59.053 --> 02:37:59.773]  Did you see that letter?
[02:38:00.373 --> 02:38:03.434]  I'm sorry, I didn't, but it's true they have all along, of course.
[02:38:03.994 --> 02:38:07.334]  Why would Hart come out and say that?
[02:38:08.074 --> 02:38:10.075]  You know, Brzezinski said the same thing.
[02:38:11.757 --> 02:38:17.661]  You know, where you have these insiders like Brzezinski and Hart saying it's coming, and I think it clearly is, right?
[02:38:17.901 --> 02:38:28.967]  And the neocons could not care less about democracy, as I said before, I was trained to be a neocon with all these people up there at the University of Chicago.
[02:38:29.107 --> 02:38:34.891]  Wolfowitz was there, Kalajdad, Chalabi, Shulsky, all of them.
[02:38:35.571 --> 02:38:37.833]  And we have to understand that the
[02:38:38.894 --> 02:39:05.003]  Founder of the neocons, Leo Strauss, his mentor in Germany and his teacher and his sponsor was Carl Schmitt, Professor Carl Schmitt, who went on to become the most notorious Nazi law professor of that benighted era, and justified in legal terms every hideous atrocity Hitler and the Nazis inflicted on everyone, including the Jews, preventive warfare, etc.
[02:39:05.543 --> 02:39:07.144]  So all these neocons
[02:39:07.614 --> 02:39:18.484]  I have been schooled there at the University of Chicago, as I was, in Schmidt and Machiavelli and Nietzsche and Hobbes.
[02:39:18.524 --> 02:39:23.349]  This is thoroughly anti-democratic training.
[02:39:23.729 --> 02:39:25.330]  This is the beast man!
[02:39:25.591 --> 02:39:28.814]  That's exactly the way all the neocons have been trained.
[02:39:29.334 --> 02:39:31.216]  I went through the exact same program.
[02:39:31.236 --> 02:39:32.337]  They were there with me.
[02:39:34.665 --> 02:39:45.110]  Strauss had just retired when I started there in 1968, but I was trained to be a neocon by a formal student protégé, co-author and literary executor, Joseph Cropsey.
[02:39:45.551 --> 02:39:50.173]  And it still is a source for producing all these neocons.
[02:39:50.213 --> 02:39:51.934]  Dr. Ball, here's my question to you.
[02:39:52.654 --> 02:39:58.537]  I do want to say, though, these people, having gone to school with them and been trained to be one of them,
[02:39:59.139 --> 02:40:04.866]  They are very smart, very well-trained, and they are completely ruthless and unprincipled.
[02:40:05.467 --> 02:40:13.036]  And they are motivated by an ideology that is anti-American, and it's basically neo-Nazi.
[02:40:13.337 --> 02:40:14.138]  That's what we're dealing with.
[02:40:14.855 --> 02:40:16.376]  Well, that Nazi theme keeps coming up.
[02:40:16.436 --> 02:40:27.280]  I mean, the main bag man for the person that bankrolled Hitler, Fritz Thiessen, was Prescott Bush, and then he got left as the executor of those banks and monies after World War II.
[02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:30.001]  So, this Nazi theme keeps popping up.
[02:40:33.397 --> 02:40:58.685]  You know, historical matter, and I have that cited in one of my books, but I'm just telling you, being a product of the neocon system, that they are neo-Nazis, they've been trained to think like neo-Nazis, and you don't have to take my word for it, there is a Canadian professor of political philosophy, Shadia Drury, D-R-U-R-Y, and she's written two books on these people.
[02:40:59.945 --> 02:41:01.966]  The Political Ideas of Leo Strauss,
[02:41:02.706 --> 02:41:05.527]  And Leo Strauss in the American Right.
[02:41:06.187 --> 02:41:11.429]  And to the best of my knowledge, Professor Drury had no contact with the University of Chicago.
[02:41:11.850 --> 02:41:13.690]  Well, I was trained to be one of these people.
[02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:15.311]  I was at the top of my class there.
[02:41:15.911 --> 02:41:18.952]  And I agree fully with everything Professor Drury says.
[02:41:19.012 --> 02:41:20.293]  All right, let me just stop you there.
[02:41:20.353 --> 02:41:21.213]  What does it mean?
[02:41:21.453 --> 02:41:23.894]  What does it mean to you, Doctor, working with these people at the highest levels?
[02:41:24.214 --> 02:41:28.776]  What does it mean studying this, to have Zbigniew Brzezinski telling the Senate committee
[02:41:29.576 --> 02:41:34.140]  Hey, the government may stage a provocation, a terror attack to blame it on Iran.
[02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:38.323]  What does it mean when Gary Hart writes a letter saying, we stage events, Iran.
[02:41:38.663 --> 02:41:40.964]  Don't think they won't stage one to attack you.
[02:41:41.005 --> 02:41:42.005]  I mean, he just said it!
[02:41:42.646 --> 02:41:46.649]  Are they doing that to terrorize Iran?
[02:41:46.669 --> 02:41:55.315]  Or is Zbigniew Brzezinski, who we know is a very corrupt cookie, and Gary Hart, who's been pushing the whole, you know, he supported the whole Homeland Security plan, wrote it up.
[02:41:55.715 --> 02:41:57.036]  Are they now jumping ship?
[02:41:58.419 --> 02:42:05.563]  Well, I think, you know, now Brzezinski, I went to the same PhD program at Harvard that produced both Brzezinski and Kissinger.
[02:42:05.623 --> 02:42:09.025]  They gave me Kissinger's old office there at the Center for International Affairs.
[02:42:09.746 --> 02:42:14.228]  I do not believe Brzezinski would qualify as a neocon.
[02:42:14.268 --> 02:42:17.490]  He is a traditional realpolitiker.
[02:42:18.011 --> 02:42:25.215]  But I think Brzezinski is certainly sending a warning to anyone who will listen to him
[02:42:25.797 --> 02:42:34.680]  That based upon his knowledge of these people and the way they operate, that some type of provocation is on the pike.
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:35.340]  It's coming.
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:43.242]  So I interpreted the statement he made as a warning by an insider that this is coming.
[02:42:44.002 --> 02:42:48.023]  I don't know him personally, but again, as you know, he ran for the president.
[02:42:48.063 --> 02:42:50.164]  He was a senator tied into CFR.
[02:42:50.922 --> 02:42:52.963]  And that's the way he sees it, too.
[02:42:53.044 --> 02:42:55.265]  So I think we have to pay attention.
[02:42:55.345 --> 02:43:01.409]  And as you pointed out, Tommy Frank said, yeah, one more terrorist attack and we're going to shut the Constitution down.
[02:43:01.949 --> 02:43:07.433]  It's already been reported that if there is another terrorist attack, Cheney's going to blame it on Iran.
[02:43:07.493 --> 02:43:14.438]  And I'm sure they will institute martial law, if not the whole country, certainly selectively, as you, again, correctly pointed out.
[02:43:15.038 --> 02:43:18.100]  They've amended the Posse Comitatus Act out of existence.
[02:43:18.970 --> 02:43:25.895]  They've amended the Insurrection Act, permitting the President to call out the National Guard for any reason at all.
[02:43:26.935 --> 02:43:35.881]  The Protect America Act in August, where basically amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act out of existence.
[02:43:36.381 --> 02:43:47.008]  The leading guidelines in the Department of Justice to prevent the Watergate abuses, those were all ended by Ashcroft.
[02:43:47.552 --> 02:43:56.776]  So, even the Department of Justice, we're now back in the days of COINTELPRO, and this new Attorney General nominee, Mukasey, he's a neocon.
[02:43:57.496 --> 02:44:01.798]  And he also covered up government involvement in the First World Trade Center bombing.
[02:44:02.758 --> 02:44:14.123]  I'm not familiar with that role, but I do know he was the judge who accepted President Bush's unilateral and unconstitutional determination
[02:44:14.753 --> 02:44:21.638]  That a United States citizen named Jose Padilla was an enemy combatant and transferred a U.S.
[02:44:21.698 --> 02:44:23.539]  citizen to a U.S.
[02:44:23.659 --> 02:44:26.702]  military break where he was held for three years and tortured.
[02:44:27.162 --> 02:44:34.147]  That's the type of nominee we have for the Attorney General, and we also have one at Homeland Security.
[02:44:34.247 --> 02:44:36.289]  Chertoff is a neocon as well.
[02:44:36.789 --> 02:44:38.210]  That brings me up to my next point.
[02:44:40.030 --> 02:44:54.178]  A, obviously you know about the secret order for the torture by Bush, that completes the circuit, and you know, they're putting people in prison for following the orders, but then Bush claimed he wasn't involved in torture after they had first advertised it and said it was good, so what does that mean in all of this?
[02:44:54.378 --> 02:45:03.523]  And then, is there any way to stop them from starting World War III and going around and arresting everybody and setting up the Third Reich, uh, the Fourth Reich?
[02:45:04.375 --> 02:45:07.757]  Well, clearly President Bush is the top of the chain of command.
[02:45:07.797 --> 02:45:20.202]  He gave the orders, and he's fully accountable for all these criminal practices, including torture, which violates the Convention Against Torture, a federal statute making torture a crime.
[02:45:20.242 --> 02:45:21.943]  But now he can't say that he didn't know.
[02:45:21.963 --> 02:45:24.064]  Well, of course he knew all along.
[02:45:24.104 --> 02:45:26.085]  I mean, he was... Yeah, we knew that!
[02:45:26.665 --> 02:45:29.186]  We knew that from the memos, obviously, but now we have him.
[02:45:29.867 --> 02:45:30.107]  Right.
[02:45:31.427 --> 02:45:33.768]  But the point is, what can we do now?
[02:45:33.968 --> 02:45:38.129]  Well, you know, we still have our First Amendment rights.
[02:45:38.269 --> 02:45:43.431]  These neocons have basically shredded the rest of the Bill of Rights.
[02:45:44.491 --> 02:45:50.473]  We can protest, demonstrate, sit in peaceful nonviolent sit-ins.
[02:45:50.893 --> 02:45:55.735]  Cindy Sheehan and others sat in there, Congressman Conyers, demanding impeachment.
[02:45:56.155 --> 02:45:57.015]  We have to do that.
[02:45:57.655 --> 02:46:08.343]  Also, we have to run candidates against incumbents that will not support impeachment of Bush and Cheney immediately to stop this.
[02:46:08.583 --> 02:46:15.749]  Well, that was my next point, is that the Democrats are more neoconnish in many cases than the Republicans, so how do we deal with that in your opinion?
[02:46:15.849 --> 02:46:21.313]  And B, what do we do if they go ahead and stage a new attack or launch a new war and try to have martial law?
[02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:27.173]  I'm singing that myself, as I think I told you.
[02:46:27.934 --> 02:46:29.356]  I'm on the U.S.
[02:46:29.416 --> 02:46:31.098]  government's terrorist watch list.
[02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:42.073]  Back in the summer of 2004, an agent from the FBI and an agent from the CIA-FBI Joint Terrorist Task Force showed up at my office.
[02:46:42.614 --> 02:47:08.793]  proceeded to interrogate me for one hour and uh... repeatedly asked me to become an informant on my uh... arab and muslim clients which would have violated their constitutional rights and my ethical obligations as an attorney i refuse to do it so they put me on all the government's terrorist watch list and as far as my lawyer can figure out there are five or six of them and i'm on all of them so i take it uh... i will be one of the first taken out when uh...
[02:47:10.875 --> 02:47:15.961]  Have you heard about the ambassador who went to an anti-war deal so now she can't fly out of Canada?
[02:47:16.906 --> 02:47:17.987]  Right, I'm on those lists.
[02:47:18.467 --> 02:47:20.168]  I mean, this is Nazi Germany!
[02:47:20.188 --> 02:47:21.249]  That's what they do now!
[02:47:21.789 --> 02:47:31.316]  Well, I'm just telling your listening audience, look, whether you like us lawyers or not, but the bottom line is there are a lot of lawyers trying to fight to stop this.
[02:47:32.196 --> 02:47:37.760]  And, you know, we lawyers are sort of the canary birds in the mine shafts of democracy.
[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:44.104]  When the air goes foul, the canary birds die, warning the miners that it's time to get out of the mine.
[02:47:44.611 --> 02:47:45.994]  Well, they're going after lawyers.
[02:47:46.094 --> 02:47:49.700]  They went after Mr. Mayfield there in Oregon.
[02:47:50.502 --> 02:47:52.926]  They went after Lynn Stewart out in New York.
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:58.283]  They tried to go after Ramsey Clark, the former Attorney General.
[02:47:58.743 --> 02:47:59.684]  They've come after me.
[02:48:01.206 --> 02:48:09.713]  So, you know, under these circumstances, I think, you know, people have to decide in accordance with their own conscience what they're going to do.
[02:48:10.053 --> 02:48:13.196]  But, I mean, even with Hitler, his own people started fighting him.
[02:48:13.656 --> 02:48:15.077]  I mean, it's got a skull.
[02:48:15.538 --> 02:48:17.299]  Eighty percent of people disagree with him now.
[02:48:17.319 --> 02:48:19.361]  Do you think they're going too far?
[02:48:19.381 --> 02:48:20.562]  I mean, do you think they're going to fail?
[02:48:21.758 --> 02:48:22.319]  I don't know.
[02:48:22.339 --> 02:48:25.822]  Isn't that really up to you and me and your listening audience, Alex?
[02:48:26.022 --> 02:48:28.324]  Yeah, I'm trying as hard as I can, Dr. Boyle.
[02:48:28.344 --> 02:48:28.685]  Stay there.
[02:48:28.745 --> 02:48:30.106]  Final second with you on the other side.
[02:48:30.867 --> 02:48:31.948]  I mean, this is it, folks.
[02:48:31.988 --> 02:48:32.909]  This is the real deal.
[02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:39.675]  This is the... This is... This is the flashpoint.
[02:48:40.676 --> 02:48:41.697]  This is the whole nine yards.
[02:48:48.004 --> 02:48:53.490]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.851 --> 02:49:01.459]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.170 --> 02:49:09.214]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.634 --> 02:49:21.020]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:24.922]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.323 --> 02:49:27.264]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.584 --> 02:49:31.426]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:37.005 --> 02:51:39.107]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:51:49.328 --> 02:51:51.729]  Final segment with Dr. Francis Boyle, Ph.D.
[02:52:12.654 --> 02:52:13.195]  Right.
[02:52:13.235 --> 02:52:18.980]  Top-level policy advisor, written international laws, advised governments, our government.
[02:52:19.460 --> 02:52:20.481]  The bio's too long.
[02:52:20.501 --> 02:52:22.062]  You can read it at Infowars.com.
[02:52:22.363 --> 02:52:25.986]  We'll go back to him and talk about some more solutions in the final equation here, but first...
[02:52:27.651 --> 02:52:32.293]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com and go down to the right-hand side to Sponsors and click on the InnerFood banner.

[02:53:04.101 --> 02:53:05.602]  866-762-9238 or Innerfood.com.
[02:53:15.996 --> 02:53:26.506]  Going back to Francis Boyle, you were just telling me during the break about you flew back into the country to Chicago and there were armed guys waiting for you and they take you into custody and, you know, you get to get interrogated.
[02:53:26.526 --> 02:53:28.768]  And I said, well, do you speak up and tell them, hey, this is America?
[02:53:29.148 --> 02:53:30.650]  You just said, no, I've been all over the world.
[02:53:30.710 --> 02:53:32.912]  It's like a communist or fascist country.
[02:53:32.952 --> 02:53:34.554]  You just keep your mouth shut.
[02:53:35.014 --> 02:53:36.836]  I mean, to see us turn into this.
[02:53:38.275 --> 02:53:41.357]  These people are bullies, and if we don't speak up, they're going to win.
[02:53:41.377 --> 02:53:45.721]  There's no doubt things are going to be worse in the final equation if we don't speak up.
[02:53:45.781 --> 02:53:48.983]  And I hope everybody out there isn't intimidated by this.
[02:53:49.023 --> 02:53:50.384]  I hope you get outraged by it.
[02:53:50.644 --> 02:53:56.088]  Dr. Boyle, I mean, you've had to deal with this with courage, speaking out against them and having this happen.
[02:53:56.528 --> 02:53:58.450]  What do you say to folks about fighting tyranny?
[02:54:00.071 --> 02:54:01.632]  Well, we're Americans, aren't we?
[02:54:02.192 --> 02:54:07.116]  We came from a background of launching a revolution against tyrants.
[02:54:07.637 --> 02:54:09.979]  I mean it's in our blood, it's in our history.
[02:54:10.139 --> 02:54:14.302]  I don't think I have to give people a lecture here about what they have to do.
[02:54:15.463 --> 02:54:18.366]  I think the purpose of my appearing on the
[02:54:19.130 --> 02:54:24.737]  Program today is agreeing with you and saying the hour is close at hand.
[02:54:25.037 --> 02:54:33.346]  If they attack Iran, they could set off World War III and then institute martial law.
[02:54:33.887 --> 02:54:38.973]  And understand, as the neocons see it,
[02:54:39.523 --> 02:54:48.908]  They've been at war with the Arab and Muslim world, 58 states and 1.5 billion people for quite some time.
[02:54:49.328 --> 02:54:55.391]  They would be happy to have a war with Iran that could degenerate all over the Middle East.
[02:54:55.471 --> 02:55:01.054]  The neocons, the clean break for Netanyahu by Perl and the rest of them.
[02:55:01.614 --> 02:55:04.936]  They want to redraw the Middle East
[02:55:05.696 --> 02:55:06.197]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:55:25.409 --> 02:55:26.409]  That's what you're pointing out.
[02:55:26.429 --> 02:55:27.630]  This is part of a chain.
[02:55:28.010 --> 02:55:29.190]  They're not failing in Iraq.
[02:55:29.210 --> 02:55:31.911]  They wanted to break it in three parts and sow sectarian violence.
[02:55:31.951 --> 02:55:33.331]  They want to spread it, don't they, sir?
[02:55:33.731 --> 02:55:34.391]  That's correct.
[02:55:34.851 --> 02:55:38.572]  From the neocon perspective, Iraq is a great success.
[02:55:38.732 --> 02:55:40.952]  They've destroyed Iraq as a state.
[02:55:41.372 --> 02:55:43.053]  They've set off a civil war.
[02:55:43.613 --> 02:55:44.993]  And now there's ethnic cleansing.
[02:55:45.193 --> 02:55:48.914]  So it doesn't bother them that they have murdered 3,816 Americans.
[02:55:49.134 --> 02:55:50.434]  Our mothers and our fathers
[02:55:54.435 --> 02:55:57.357]  Our brothers and our sisters and our sons and our daughters.
[02:55:57.958 --> 02:56:00.980]  And I use the word murder as a law professor.
[02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:02.561]  I taught criminal law.
[02:56:03.161 --> 02:56:08.645]  Murder means the intentional killing of a human being with malice or forethought.
[02:56:08.685 --> 02:56:09.605]  Sir, we're out of time.
[02:56:09.665 --> 02:56:11.787]  I want to get you up in the next few weeks for a full hour.
[02:56:12.147 --> 02:56:13.148]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[02:56:13.168 --> 02:56:16.430]  You're the author of Three Bugs, one of them destroying world order.
[02:56:16.730 --> 02:56:17.651]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:56:18.431 --> 02:56:19.112]  Thank you very much.
[02:56:19.312 --> 02:56:19.792]  God bless.
[02:56:19.832 --> 02:56:20.853]  We'll see you back tomorrow.
