[00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:06.120]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.862]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:09.663]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.324 --> 00:00:11.145]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:12.786]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:17.231]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:21.775]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:23.477]  A year ago...
[00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:39.926]  We had several long conversations here in my office, mainly my producer did, with Kevin Tillman, brother of Pat Tillman.
[00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:46.075]  And he didn't want us to talk about some of the things he said and believed at that time.
[00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:52.777]  And then, of course, because of people hammering him and calling him so much, he said, look, just call me back in a few months and I may be ready to go public.
[00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:54.618]  And we called back in a few months.
[00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.839]  We had gotten his phone number through somebody that we knew that knew him.
[00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.480]  The number had changed.
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.880]  And then we didn't even try to track it down again.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.942]  We said, look, we're just going to leave him alone and see if this all comes out.
[00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:10.686]  It has come out, okay?
[00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:15.750]  Now, about three months ago, we went on air and said it's clear that he was murdered.
[00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:20.954]  The Army colonel that did the investigation said there was evidence of foul play.
[00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:25.698]  That was even in the San Francisco Chronicle and several other major newspapers.
[00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.859]  So this was not a secret at that point.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.522]  Now we have the Army Medical Report.
[00:01:32.062 --> 00:01:34.864]  They triple-tapped him up close in the head.
[00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:38.087]  They murdered him.
[00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:58.878]  And they were coming after his brother as well, because they cannot have a brother go join the military to help his other brother, Kevin, get in there, be the big propaganda boon, leaving the NFL millions a year, to go join the Army Rangers, and to go to Afghanistan and Iraq, and to find out it was all a fraud.
[00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:06.680]  He saw the same things that Cory Rowe saw in Afghanistan, where they would stage events and claim they were fighting Al-Qaeda,
[00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:10.288]  Where they would capture Taliban and they'd be ordered to release them.
[00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:11.868]  It is a staged event.
[00:02:13.448 --> 00:02:21.290]  And he and his brother began writing about this right before he was killed.
[00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.571]  Well, now it is mainstream news.
[00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:27.951]  It came out on Keith Uberman last night briefly.
[00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:31.352]  The Associated Press hid the facts in plain view.
[00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.194]  With a nondescript headline that went on to admit that the army doctors believed he had been murdered.
[00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:49.644]  Now, even if you're the best rifle shot out there, with an M16, it's very hard to triple tap someone with close bullets together in the head.
[00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:53.488]  Because when the first one hits, the head's gonna pop back and move violently.
[00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:57.651]  When the next one hits, I mean, even though they're just a few feet behind each other,
[00:02:58.385 --> 00:02:59.246]  This is what happens.
[00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.728]  And he had three bullet holes very close to each other.
[00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:05.229]  Now, they'd already shot him in the chest and legs.
[00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.871]  He'd gotten behind a rock.
[00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:08.552]  He was saying, stop, you know it's me.
[00:03:08.852 --> 00:03:11.213]  They walked right up and executed Pat Tillman.
[00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:13.595]  And this is the reports we've gotten.
[00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:17.818]  Special forces, some type of black operators, were inserted into their unit.
[00:03:18.838 --> 00:03:21.580]  And they just tapped him right in front of everybody.
[00:03:22.741 --> 00:03:25.462]  Now, this is also what happened with Private Lynch.
[00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.684]  As soon as it came out that she cowered in fear.
[00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.351]  As soon as it came out that the army used her for propaganda to get women in the military.
[00:03:33.031 --> 00:03:34.032]  They used her as a boon.
[00:03:34.072 --> 00:03:35.112]  She cowered in fear.
[00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:46.995]  It was a black guy, a white guy, and it was mainly, I forget his name, I've got to pull the articles, a Hispanic fella that actually fought off a bunch of the Iraqis and did kill a bunch of them until they did shoot him at close range.
[00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:50.776]  She cowered in fear the whole time in the back of the truck.
[00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:52.436]  She cowered at the hospital.
[00:03:52.997 --> 00:03:54.197]  They staged that whole deal.
[00:03:55.197 --> 00:04:08.840]  And when it came out that she had staged this, or that the military had staged this, and that the whole event was a fable, within one week they killed four people that were part of the rescue and one person who had been saved.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.501]  And I mean, they would come to middle-class neighborhoods and double-tap in the head.
[00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:23.603]  They reported a man in a black mask and uniform popped up over the back fence, fired two rounds into my son's head as he stood at the barbecue pit from 20 yards away.
[00:04:24.123 --> 00:04:24.903]  Total precision.
[00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:27.100]  Other people would be pulled over.
[00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:29.924]  They would be drowned in a puddle of water.
[00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:33.168]  Others would have their head bashed in, thrown off bridges.
[00:04:33.188 --> 00:04:37.534]  I mean, they were killing people just to keep that story going.
[00:04:38.553 --> 00:04:39.273]  Now it's out.
[00:04:39.293 --> 00:04:41.815]  We'll cover it when we get back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:46.517]  New evidence clearly indicates Pat Tillman was executed.
[00:04:47.117 --> 00:04:54.840]  PrisonPlanet.com InfoWars.com Right now, we gotta make sure this story gets through the gatekeepers.
[00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:56.601]  That's what they do.
[00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.302]  They murdered Pat Tillman.
[00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:09.700]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:17.671]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:25.464]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.864 --> 00:05:37.271]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:41.114]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:43.495]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:47.658]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:18.718 --> 00:07:25.420]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.361]  There are no reported side effects.

[00:08:02.424 --> 00:08:08.446]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:12.087]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.988 --> 00:08:25.092]  Alright, you need to not just read the new article itself on prisonplanet.com right now that needs to be sent out to the four winds, every hill and mountain, get out there and
[00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:28.517]  Scream this out because they're desperately trying to censor it.
[00:08:28.537 --> 00:08:32.679]  They murdered him to stop his free speech and to shut him down.
[00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:33.979]  He was going to come back.
[00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.180]  This has been on the record.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.060]  This has even come out in mainstream news.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.002]  And he was going to speak out against the war, calling it illegal and a fraud.
[00:08:41.902 --> 00:08:43.963]  Saying there were no WMDs.
[00:08:44.103 --> 00:08:44.903]  He was in Iraq.
[00:08:44.943 --> 00:08:46.024]  He was in Afghanistan.
[00:08:46.444 --> 00:08:48.104]  Sent back to Afghanistan and killed.
[00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:52.406]  Pat Tillman learned the truth that it was all a fraud.
[00:08:52.946 --> 00:08:54.487]  And just like they tried to use
[00:08:56.062 --> 00:08:58.784]  Jessica Lynch, and they killed a bunch of people to cover that up.
[00:08:59.184 --> 00:09:00.906]  She went public and said, okay, it's a hoax.
[00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:01.566]  It's a hoax.
[00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:02.647]  That was her words.
[00:09:02.707 --> 00:09:03.327]  It's a hoax.
[00:09:03.828 --> 00:09:04.968]  It is a fable.
[00:09:05.409 --> 00:09:06.930]  It is a construct.
[00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.271]  She said all three of those things.
[00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:09.532]  It is a hoax.
[00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:10.472]  It is a fable.
[00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:11.973]  It is a construct.
[00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.534]  It isn't real.
[00:09:14.835 --> 00:09:16.917]  I didn't fight anybody.
[00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.118]  I was afraid.
[00:09:19.118 --> 00:09:20.019]  I cowered.
[00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:22.801]  The government tried to take
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:32.202]  The heroism of the other people involved, the men, and they tried to use it as a poster girl for the military.
[00:09:34.362 --> 00:09:39.964]  And when people started shooting their mouths off, the government sent hitmen out to murder them.
[00:09:40.304 --> 00:09:44.305]  Do you understand the cold-blooded individuals we're dealing with?
[00:09:44.365 --> 00:09:45.725]  Understand military psychology.
[00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:56.416]  Going back a thousand plus years where they would put hundreds if not thousands of their troops out in the open or in a gorge where they knew they'd be ambushed to draw an enemy out.
[00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:59.018]  It was simply a sacrifice of troops.
[00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:11.944]  That is routinely done now, where you send a whole unit, or it could be an even larger group, up a hill or into an area where you know they're going to be wiped out, to draw out and to just learn enemy troop strength levels.
[00:10:12.344 --> 00:10:17.505]  That is in 101 West Point Military Manuals, by the way.
[00:10:17.565 --> 00:10:19.846]  That's in Current Strategia.
[00:10:21.189 --> 00:10:24.030]  Now the general public doesn't even know what the word strategia means.
[00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.371]  I'm not being mean to you.
[00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:27.312]  I'm saying you better start learning.
[00:10:27.332 --> 00:10:30.873]  They don't do things like that.
[00:10:31.533 --> 00:10:35.235]  So see, once you have that attitude, it's yeah, let's kill 3,000 people.
[00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:36.375]  It'll get our war launched.
[00:10:36.735 --> 00:10:37.856]  It's for the greater good.
[00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:40.397]  Or yeah, too bad for Pat.
[00:10:40.437 --> 00:10:41.297]  He's misguided.
[00:10:41.737 --> 00:10:44.018]  Go ahead and send in the men to get rid of him.
[00:10:45.859 --> 00:10:47.500]  And this is how the whole thing works.
[00:10:49.542 --> 00:11:06.307]  That's why a couple years ago I was at a TV studio and they had a radio studio and they right before I went on they had this guy who'd written a propaganda book that I knew was put out by the Pentagon because I'd already read about it and he was this young individual
[00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:10.929]  And he was in there propagandizing for the Afghanistan war.
[00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:18.432]  And I walk in there in the break and I go, because they were getting ready for me to come in, and I said, you know, what about the airlift of evil flying people out?
[00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:24.376]  And he gave me this knowing look for just a second, kind of like a window opening, like, he knows, and I could just tell the guy was a spook.
[00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:28.258]  And I said, so, you're running domestic operations, you're still in the military?
[00:11:28.278 --> 00:11:31.699]  And he went, well, we're fighting for America, I'll just say that.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:32.800]  Who are you?
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.341]  And I went, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:35.421]  He went, oh.
[00:11:35.981 --> 00:11:36.682]  And I went, yeah.
[00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:43.164]  Were you involved in any of that stuff with Gruckheimer, where they were exterminating whole groups?
[00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:44.664]  He goes, yeah, I know Gruckheimer.
[00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:49.305]  And they all said he kind of bowed up, and he went, and I went, let me tell you something, you little spook.
[00:11:50.746 --> 00:11:53.366]  I said, we're going to expose what you're doing, and you will be defeated.
[00:11:54.567 --> 00:11:56.347]  Operative, running around domestically.
[00:11:57.287 --> 00:11:59.427]  I am not putting up with this stuff anymore.
[00:12:01.048 --> 00:12:04.128]  And you better stop being naive, okay?
[00:12:05.169 --> 00:12:06.629]  I just want you to realize that.
[00:12:07.487 --> 00:12:12.070]  That we are in serious, serious trouble right now.
[00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:19.174]  Now, I am going to... We have Corey Rowe and Tom Rowe coming up in 20 minutes.
[00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:24.297]  Talked to Corey at length yesterday.
[00:12:24.317 --> 00:12:26.958]  We'll give you just a short and sweet skinny of what happened.
[00:12:27.338 --> 00:12:31.621]  Also, Tom Rowe, great guy, is going to be popping in with his son.
[00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:35.403]  Then, in the middle of the show, we have Dr. Jerome Corcion.
[00:12:37.216 --> 00:12:38.517]  They'll also be in studio soon.
[00:12:38.537 --> 00:12:41.259]  That's another issue.
[00:12:41.459 --> 00:12:50.745]  And we've got Jessica Wilson, who literally had two cops, huge cops, sandwich themselves on the intelligent and lovely young lady.
[00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:52.847]  I've now seen video of it.
[00:12:52.907 --> 00:12:57.610]  It's not just of her being grabbed from her camera view, but the cops sandwiching her.
[00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:03.574]  And we'll talk about that whole spin and how Fox News yesterday had her on.
[00:13:05.277 --> 00:13:16.345]  And said, yeah, North American Union is a good idea, Amaro is a good idea, but she's bad because she's a conspiracy theory and says it exists, but that it's still a good thing.
[00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:18.567]  See, that's the psychological warfare.
[00:13:18.587 --> 00:13:25.952]  And if we have time, we'll air some of her interview from Fox, because they tried every trick in the book on this poor young lady.
[00:13:26.632 --> 00:13:28.854]  So she's going to be popping in as well today.
[00:13:29.134 --> 00:13:30.615]  Let me get into Pat Tillman right now.
[00:13:30.655 --> 00:13:32.997]  Folks, this news could bring the neocons down.
[00:13:34.494 --> 00:13:36.595]  This news could bring them down right now.
[00:13:39.956 --> 00:13:43.438]  New evidence clearly indicates Pat Tillman was executed.
[00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:46.279]  As we told you over a year ago.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:53.622]  Army medical examiners concluded Pat Tillman was shot three times in the head from just 10 yards away.
[00:13:53.742 --> 00:13:56.604]  Actually it says from 10 yards or closer.
[00:13:56.644 --> 00:13:59.385]  They said there's no way it could be any further than 10 yards.
[00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:04.867]  And it's hard, even in this situation, to triple-tap somebody from ten yards perfectly in the head.
[00:14:05.647 --> 00:14:08.628]  It says, no evidence of friendly fire damage at scene.
[00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:11.069]  That's the Army report that they squashed.
[00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:14.510]  Army attorneys congratulated each other over the cover-up.
[00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.491]  That's now been released.
[00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:16.891]  They admit they covered it up.
[00:14:17.492 --> 00:14:26.555]  Wesley Clark concludes, orders came from the very top to murder pro football star because he was about to become an anti-war political icon.
[00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.111]  They could not deal with this.
[00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:32.631]  They could not deal with him.
[00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:41.014]  I saw an editorial a few months ago in a major paper by a former military individual going, alright, he was killed by friendly fire and we knew.
[00:14:41.034 --> 00:14:42.814]  And we lied about it.
[00:14:43.394 --> 00:14:48.796]  You don't want this good man to die and not let his death be used for the great fight against Al Qaeda.
[00:14:49.476 --> 00:14:51.356]  Yeah, we lie, but that's good.
[00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:54.577]  See, yeah, Jack Bauer tortures kids on TV.
[00:14:54.637 --> 00:14:55.858]  That's what good guys do.
[00:14:56.238 --> 00:14:57.118]  Yeah, we lie.
[00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.190]  You see, folks, they just accept this.
[00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:01.810]  But see, there's another lie.
[00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.071]  They went in there and they murdered him.
[00:15:04.931 --> 00:15:08.492]  And they shot him, reportedly, from about 50 yards away.
[00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:09.432]  Didn't kill him.
[00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:10.952]  Body armor deflected most of it.
[00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:15.494]  But, depending on the two reports, but they're basically the same.
[00:15:15.694 --> 00:15:16.674]  He got shot a bunch.
[00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:19.443]  Got a bunch of burst into him.
[00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.105]  Of course, it didn't deflect all of it.
[00:15:22.145 --> 00:15:23.826]  Some of the rounds he went through the body armor.
[00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:27.289]  He had, you know, shoulders were shattered.
[00:15:27.369 --> 00:15:28.189]  Shot in the legs.
[00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.530]  He gets behind some rocks.
[00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.232]  He starts screaming, I'm Pat Tillman.
[00:15:31.652 --> 00:15:32.292]  I'm Pat Tillman.
[00:15:32.312 --> 00:15:33.433]  Looks like he put his hand up.
[00:15:33.473 --> 00:15:34.534]  They shot that.
[00:15:36.676 --> 00:15:43.961]  And then he got mad and forced himself up on one leg and stood up and they just ran right up and went boom, boom, boom.
[00:15:44.242 --> 00:15:44.922]  Triple burst.
[00:15:45.823 --> 00:15:46.864]  Right in the head.
[00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.206]  And had a big celebration.
[00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:49.926]  Yeah!
[00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:51.727]  Yeah, that little traitor!
[00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:53.608]  That little liberal!
[00:15:53.808 --> 00:15:57.590]  Of course they were all, of course the hitmen they sent were jealous, of course, of a real man.
[00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.691]  Turning out, what, three million dollars a year.
[00:16:00.332 --> 00:16:03.353]  All the power, all the women, all the prestige, everything.
[00:16:04.694 --> 00:16:07.996]  Somebody who actually went and signed up, because at first he believed the propaganda.
[00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:09.817]  And because he wanted to be there with his brother.
[00:16:12.034 --> 00:16:13.675]  So, that's what they did.
[00:16:14.376 --> 00:16:16.117]  And we've got detailed reports out on it.
[00:16:16.137 --> 00:16:18.739]  We're going to be talking more about it as the show progresses here.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.002]  This will be a test of the alternative media.
[00:16:22.702 --> 00:16:25.284]  Are we going to let them suppress this story?
[00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:39.495]  Astounding new details surrounding the death of Pat Tillman clearly indicate that Top Brass decided to execute the former pro football star in cold blood to prevent him from returning home and becoming an anti-war icon.
[00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:41.336]  He would have ended the war single-handedly.
[00:16:41.883 --> 00:16:43.804]  They'd try to dig up dirt on him, it wouldn't work.
[00:16:44.405 --> 00:16:50.128]  These same criminals then engage in a sophisticated conspiracy to create a phony, quote, friendly fire cover story.
[00:16:50.168 --> 00:16:51.089]  This is all admitted now.
[00:16:52.149 --> 00:17:03.496]  Shocking new facts emerged about the case last night, but were brazenly and bizarrely underplayed by the Associated Press under nondescript headlines like, new details of Tillman's death.
[00:17:04.677 --> 00:17:11.321]  A complete disservice to the horrific implications of the new evidence carries.
[00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:13.012]  This is from the AP.
[00:17:13.412 --> 00:17:29.806]  Army medical examiners were suspicious about the close proximity of the three bullet holes in Pat Tillman's forehead and tried without success to get authorities to investigate whether the former NFL player's death amounted to a crime according to documents obtained by the Associated Press.
[00:17:30.286 --> 00:17:31.127]  But let's go further.
[00:17:31.407 --> 00:17:32.428]  We have the Army Colonel.
[00:17:33.923 --> 00:17:38.084]  Saying that they believed it was a homicide and were told to shut up and falsify reports.
[00:17:38.705 --> 00:17:39.245]  They wouldn't.
[00:17:39.365 --> 00:17:42.306]  They called in other higher-level brass to do it.
[00:17:44.527 --> 00:17:45.827]  We're also looking into deaths.
[00:17:45.907 --> 00:17:50.969]  It appears we're on this trail that there have been a bunch of deaths in the unit now, non-military related.
[00:17:51.469 --> 00:17:58.491]  Oh yeah, and the hitmen that did this, you can bet they're not going to be alive long if they're not already pushing up daisies.
[00:17:59.272 --> 00:17:59.912]  You fools!
[00:18:01.989 --> 00:18:05.532]  The medical evidence did not match up with the scenarios described.
[00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:10.636]  A doctor examined Hillman's body after he was killed on a battlefield in Afghanistan in 2004, told investigators.
[00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:20.545]  The doctors, whose names were blacked out, said that the bullet holes were so close together that it appeared that Army Ranger was cut down by an M-16 fired from a mere 10 yards
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.441]  Or so away.
[00:18:22.881 --> 00:18:27.723]  The report also stated that no evidence at all of enemy fire was found at the scene.
[00:18:28.504 --> 00:18:32.046]  No one was hit by enemy fire nor was any government equipment struck.
[00:18:33.406 --> 00:18:34.647]  The article also reveals that
[00:18:35.493 --> 00:18:45.877]  Army attorneys sent each other congratulatory emails for keeping criminal investigators at bay as the Army conducted an internal friendly fire investigation that resulted in administrative or non-criminal punishments.
[00:18:46.477 --> 00:19:01.902]  So there was no evidence whatsoever of friendly fire, but the ballistics data clearly indicated that the three headshots had been fired from just 10 yards or closer, and that the Army tried to concoct a hoax friendly fire story that sent gloating
[00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:10.553]  Back-slapping emails congratulating each other over their success while preventing the doctors from exploring the possibility of murder.
[00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:19.477]  How can any sane or rational individual weigh this evidence and not come to the conclusion that Tillman was deliberately gunned down in cold blood?
[00:19:20.838 --> 00:19:24.200]  The evidence points directly to it and the motivation is clear.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:31.524]  Tillman abandoned a lucrative career in pro football immediately after 9-11 because he felt a rampaging patriotic urge to defend his country.
[00:19:32.159 --> 00:19:36.700]  And because it became a poster child for the war and recruiting on terror as a result.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:48.342]  But when he discovered that the invasion of Iraq was based on a mountain of lies and deceit and had nothing to do with defending America, he became infuriated and was ready to return home to become an anti-war hero.
[00:19:49.483 --> 00:19:52.283]  And we've got his quotes, stuff, letters he wrote, his diary.
[00:19:52.963 --> 00:19:54.284]  The government took that by the way.
[00:19:54.824 --> 00:19:55.724]  Oh yeah, they took it all.
[00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:57.024]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:07.652]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:07.992 --> 00:20:12.074]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.374 --> 00:20:12.935]  We listened.
[00:20:13.215 --> 00:20:18.217]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.478 --> 00:20:18.958]  We listened.
[00:20:19.338 --> 00:20:22.379]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:23.339]  We listened.
[00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:27.880]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:28.741]  We listened.
[00:20:29.081 --> 00:20:34.322]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:34.742 --> 00:20:36.083]  Again, we listened.
[00:20:36.463 --> 00:20:43.785]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:20:44.245 --> 00:20:46.889]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[00:20:47.069 --> 00:20:47.269]  Only $279.
[00:20:47.309 --> 00:20:47.930]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:48.210]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.271 --> 00:20:49.893]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:20:49.933 --> 00:20:50.874]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.281 --> 00:21:05.126]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:06.408]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:21:06.588 --> 00:21:10.153]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:21:10.453 --> 00:21:12.977]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:21:13.377 --> 00:21:15.120]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.743]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:21:18.804 --> 00:21:33.210]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.372]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.541]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.162 --> 00:22:13.108]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.528 --> 00:22:20.733]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.463 --> 00:22:26.948]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:00.675 --> 00:23:03.178]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.738 --> 00:23:09.044]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[00:23:09.725 --> 00:23:15.911]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[00:23:16.572 --> 00:23:19.395]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:23:19.995 --> 00:23:31.219]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:04.121 --> 00:24:04.661]  We're good.
[00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:20.562]  Ain't constant sorrow his thing?
[00:24:20.682 --> 00:24:28.847]  I am the man of constant sorrow.
[00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:34.369]  I've seen trouble of all my days.
[00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:38.272]  I'm a bit fairway.
[00:24:41.474 --> 00:25:07.536]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, you're about to hear Wesley Clark, Keith Oberman, this video clip is going up on PrisonPlanet.com in the next few minutes, also at JonesReport.com and they get into, well the mother thinks he may have been murdered, well no, that's the army colonel who was there investigating, that is now the transcripts, that is the evidence
[00:25:08.616 --> 00:25:11.278]  Okay, I mean, there was no enemy within hundreds of miles.
[00:25:11.298 --> 00:25:12.819]  They were out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:25:13.159 --> 00:25:14.880]  They take him out there and they execute him.
[00:25:15.521 --> 00:25:18.202]  He's begging for his life and they come right up and shoot him.
[00:25:18.743 --> 00:25:20.084]  He's saying, you idiots, it's me.
[00:25:20.124 --> 00:25:22.906]  They walk right up and shoot him and then cover the whole thing up.
[00:25:23.326 --> 00:25:27.669]  Right when he's writing his diary and writing letters home and saying, I'm going to go public when I get back.
[00:25:28.829 --> 00:25:30.050]  They murdered him.
[00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.891]  Period.
[00:25:31.691 --> 00:25:37.255]  It's, it's, it's, and regardless, if you kill somebody by accident and then cover it up, that now becomes manslaughter.
[00:25:37.805 --> 00:25:39.727]  And it has a bunch of conspiracy charges on it.
[00:25:41.428 --> 00:25:42.429]  That's what these people do!
[00:25:43.529 --> 00:25:44.530]  Now let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:44.910]  Here it is.
[00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:47.372]  General Clark, let me turn from this story.
[00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:52.396]  We expected to spend all of our time with you tonight talking about this, but there have been two developments in the Pat Tillman story.
[00:25:52.436 --> 00:25:53.077]  A fiasco.
[00:25:53.097 --> 00:25:55.579]  There's no other word for it now in this awful report tonight.
[00:25:56.859 --> 00:26:05.226]  Parsing through these documents obtained by the Associated Press that indicate that army investigators were denied permission to see whether or not Pat Tillman's death in Afghanistan
[00:26:05.766 --> 00:26:18.457]  as an army ranger was a deliberate fragging, was a case of murder even though the shots were seemingly so close together in his head that they looked to the doctors on the scene that they might have been fired from only ten yards away.
[00:26:18.758 --> 00:26:26.865]  Not only was their access denied here but the army lawyers were congratulating themselves in email traffic from keeping this from becoming a criminal investigation.
[00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:29.467]  Do you think this case is still wide open?
[00:26:29.907 --> 00:26:31.309]  Absolutely, and it should be.
[00:26:32.109 --> 00:26:36.633]  The evidence of some problems is very, very clear.
[00:26:38.014 --> 00:26:45.921]  Mary Tillman and the Tillman family have been incredibly courageous in pursuing the truth in this, and the truth is not yet out.
[00:26:46.662 --> 00:26:57.531]  If there's even a hint that there was something like a homicide or a murder in this case, it should have been fully investigated and proved or disproved, and we don't really know how far up
[00:26:58.546 --> 00:27:00.008]  Was it the Secretary of Defense's office?
[00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:01.310]  Was it the White House?
[00:27:01.751 --> 00:27:13.426]  Where did the idea that you shouldn't give any indication of what happened to Tillman, just go ahead and go through with the burial ceremony, give him the silver star, where did that, where was that idea blessed?
[00:27:13.826 --> 00:27:20.653]  You can be sure that that idea did not originate or stop at the two or three star level.
[00:27:20.873 --> 00:27:28.921]  Someone approved that all the way to the top because Pat Tillman was a political symbol used by the administration when it suited their purposes.
[00:27:29.873 --> 00:27:45.801]  Well, we have assumed from the beginning that that was exactly the scenario, that this possibility that his death from friendly fire would somehow affect, in some way that neither of us has ever been able to understand, somehow affect people's appreciation for his patriotism and sacrifice.
[00:27:46.141 --> 00:27:50.504]  Does it not begin to look more and more like that we're going the wrong direction in this?
[00:27:50.804 --> 00:28:03.652]  That they were not trying to protect something slightly negative from coming out, but in fact protecting the accusation that his mother has made and has not gotten a lot of attention to, that perhaps he was indeed murdered.
[00:28:03.692 --> 00:28:06.654]  Were we actually underestimating what was being covered up here?
[00:28:06.674 --> 00:28:07.935]  It's very possible.
[00:28:08.015 --> 00:28:09.336]  We just don't know, Keith.
[00:28:09.736 --> 00:28:12.018]  I think the responsible thing for the Pentagon to do
[00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:21.502]  And for the Congress to do is to demand that the investigation be reopened and people all the way up the chain of command, to the very top, discuss what happened, when, why.
[00:28:21.902 --> 00:28:26.184]  We get to the facts about why the murder charge wasn't fully investigated.
[00:28:26.365 --> 00:28:28.606]  I looked at some of the investigations.
[00:28:28.626 --> 00:28:29.406]  I looked at the tape.
[00:28:29.486 --> 00:28:30.827]  I looked at the rerun of the scene.
[00:28:31.247 --> 00:28:32.607]  I met with the Tillman family.
[00:28:32.828 --> 00:28:39.691]  And honestly, the distance, even the investigators said that the shots were fired at less than 100 meters.
[00:28:40.131 --> 00:28:41.592]  And okay, the light was failing.
[00:28:42.652 --> 00:28:44.573]  He had a clearly recognizable silhouette.
[00:28:44.613 --> 00:28:46.474]  His weapon was clearly visible.
[00:28:46.854 --> 00:28:47.755]  The type of weapon.
[00:28:49.435 --> 00:28:51.716]  It's really hard for people to understand this.
[00:28:52.137 --> 00:28:54.058]  The investigation needs to be real.
[00:28:54.178 --> 00:28:55.838]  Alright, yeah, he was triple tapped.
[00:28:56.559 --> 00:29:01.901]  Now it's come out that, first they were saying he wasn't even shot in the head, that the bullet holes are like two inches apart.
[00:29:02.301 --> 00:29:03.622]  All three in a two inch spread.
[00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:08.404]  I mean, that is super shooting if it was fifty yards away.
[00:29:09.145 --> 00:29:11.746]  I mean, that is just incredible shooting at a hundred yards away.
[00:29:12.945 --> 00:29:16.929]  Uh, and uh, I mean this is, he had, they shot him all over.
[00:29:16.969 --> 00:29:18.891]  They shot him first and he fell down, folks.
[00:29:18.911 --> 00:29:21.073]  And he's screaming and yelling on Pat Tillman.
[00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:23.135]  And they marched right up and killed him.
[00:29:24.196 --> 00:29:24.516]  Okay?
[00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:30.922]  And... It's the same thing with Jessica Lynch.
[00:29:30.942 --> 00:29:32.383]  But see how this blows up in their face?
[00:29:33.244 --> 00:29:35.005]  If they wouldn't have killed him, he'd have come back.
[00:29:35.046 --> 00:29:36.387]  They could have tried to discredit him.
[00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:41.746]  It wouldn't have gone well for him, but by them murdering him, it's gonna end up being ten times worse for him.
[00:29:41.986 --> 00:29:45.589]  Just like making the whole Private Lynch thing up got worse for him.
[00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:47.470]  Didn't matter who they killed, it still came out.
[00:29:51.533 --> 00:29:52.494]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.514 --> 00:29:54.575]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.436 --> 00:29:58.218]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:17.185 --> 00:31:20.889]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:23.832]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:31:24.453 --> 00:31:28.737]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:31:28.957 --> 00:31:33.202]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:37.965]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.

[00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:07.416]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home that you can use anytime that helps reduce back pain, sciatica, hip pain, and more?
[00:32:07.536 --> 00:32:10.238]  A tool that helps relieve the pain and doesn't just treat the symptoms?
[00:32:10.458 --> 00:32:12.580]  You need the Sacrowegi Sacral Stabilizer.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.442]  One satisfied user states, I don't believe in gadgets, but this is a miracle!
[00:32:16.622 --> 00:32:17.503]  Yes, that's right.
[00:32:17.603 --> 00:32:22.907]  Just relax 20 minutes daily or when needed to help correct the muscle imbalance that creates many of these symptoms.
[00:32:23.167 --> 00:32:27.209]  Gravity does the work with the Sacrowegi under the sacrum and support under your neck.

[00:33:17.831 --> 00:33:21.992]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board?
[00:33:22.272 --> 00:33:26.513]  And let this train keep on riding, riding on.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.423]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:44.763 --> 00:33:50.147]  We got Cory Rowe on the line with us.
[00:34:09.776 --> 00:34:13.042]  Your phone calls did get him to release you from Fort Drum.
[00:34:13.082 --> 00:34:15.667]  They gave him his papers and said, we don't know why we have you.
[00:34:17.009 --> 00:34:18.672]  You have an honorable discharge.
[00:34:19.493 --> 00:34:20.495]  And they said, who are you?
[00:34:20.555 --> 00:34:21.236]  What is going on?
[00:34:21.256 --> 00:34:22.058]  We've never seen this.
[00:34:23.118 --> 00:34:25.800]  And then he said, look, this already happened 18 months ago.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.463]  I'm going down to Fort Campbell there on the Kentucky-Tennessee line.
[00:34:30.503 --> 00:34:35.226]  He is there now trying to straighten all this out and joining us.
[00:34:35.246 --> 00:34:41.350]  The buildings are all basically bunkers, so he's outside right now via cell phone because his cell won't work inside.
[00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:45.673]  Corey, it's glad to see you getting clear of all this baloney.
[00:34:46.314 --> 00:34:47.814]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on, man.
[00:34:49.053 --> 00:34:54.018]  It's been crazy so far, and I'm sure it's going to continue to be crazy for another week or so.
[00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:57.721]  I'm down here, you know, going through paperwork, talking with people, trying to figure out what's going on.
[00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:03.467]  But, you know, at the same time, I just really want to, first off and foremost, thank everyone for their support.
[00:35:03.567 --> 00:35:06.910]  I mean, the support coming from everyone has just been completely overwhelming.
[00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:13.677]  The phone calls that these institutions received, I mean, they've had to have actual press secretaries respond.
[00:35:14.173 --> 00:35:29.842]  I mean, the amount of support has just been increasingly overwhelming, and I just really want to say thank you to everyone out there who made a phone call, or sent a letter, or even just kept me in their prayers, because it's really important, and this is not just a single case.
[00:35:29.902 --> 00:35:42.310]  I mean, they're doing this all across the military, to all kinds of different soldiers, trying to get them back here, trying to get them to go back over to Iraq, because they don't have the retention and the re-enlistment and the actual enlistment that they're trying to achieve.
[00:35:43.197 --> 00:35:45.720]  You know, they're doing this across every branch of the military.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:56.950]  There's soldiers down here, I'm on Fort Campbell right now, sitting outside 2nd 187, and there's soldiers that have been stopped, lost, and involuntary, extended now for over two years of their detracted date.
[00:35:57.331 --> 00:36:00.534]  They are getting sent back again now, this is for their fourth tour in Iraq.
[00:36:01.014 --> 00:36:02.696]  And they're not getting sent anywhere nice, people.
[00:36:02.716 --> 00:36:05.620]  They're getting sent to the Triangle of Death, south of Baghdad.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:12.389]  I don't remember the exact name of the town, but the battalion that is there now has an average of losing one soldier a week.
[00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:16.922]  Yeah, it's a town around Tikrit.
[00:36:16.942 --> 00:36:22.123]  It's not actually Tikrit, but it's in that area just south of Baghdad, where they're going to be headed.
[00:36:22.383 --> 00:36:25.724]  And they're just putting more soldiers in harm's way.
[00:36:26.904 --> 00:36:33.966]  And by the way, all these armchair quarterbacks say, oh, who cares if they make these boys stay there four or five tours.
[00:36:34.366 --> 00:36:36.927]  Hey, my grandfather only had to do 22 missions.
[00:36:38.187 --> 00:36:39.068]  Uh, over Europe.
[00:36:39.648 --> 00:36:42.029]  Uh, I mean, in World War II, you had one year.
[00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:43.430]  Vietnam, you had one year.
[00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:55.917]  Since when do you have to, you, uh, Corey, let's go through, A, how you actually got picked up, the facts, what really happened, and then let's walk through, uh, what, we just lost him.
[00:36:56.137 --> 00:36:57.098]  Uh, get him back on.
[00:36:58.439 --> 00:37:00.200]  That's what I thought I heard, a drop there.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.240]  Let's, uh, get him back on.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.221]  Really bad cell reception out there.
[00:37:03.281 --> 00:37:04.282]  Just, uh, get him back on.
[00:37:05.538 --> 00:37:06.719]  But I just talked to him again.
[00:37:06.899 --> 00:37:09.320]  Yes, he has his papers.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.200]  He was honorably discharged.
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.662]  And there was some talk of an automatic re-upping, a stop-loss.
[00:37:14.722 --> 00:37:30.908]  And by the way, here in my office, Weldon Henson, honorably discharged from the Air Force, he said when he went to sign out of his papers, what, like a year ago, they tricked him and put slip, because you're signing like when you're buying a house, like 20 papers.
[00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:35.110]  And he's flipping through, reading, and he goes, wait, this is a re-sign-up.
[00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.270]  And they just were giggling.
[00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.611]  I mean, folks, that's how criminal it is.
[00:37:40.011 --> 00:37:47.934]  Weldon Henson that works in my office, you know, high and tight haircut right now, conservative, you know, sings country music in the bars here in town.
[00:37:48.594 --> 00:37:49.634]  I mean, gung-ho.
[00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:50.835]  It woke him up.
[00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:56.456]  They tried to trick him in his paperwork, slipping a paper in that would sign him up for a couple more years.
[00:37:56.677 --> 00:37:58.217]  In fact, I was talking about having him on air today.
[00:37:58.237 --> 00:37:58.917]  He's in there right now.
[00:37:58.937 --> 00:37:59.998]  I might drag him in here.
[00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:01.818]  Your phone cut out, Corey.
[00:38:01.858 --> 00:38:04.319]  I was telling the story about even in my office,
[00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:15.480]  That Weldon Henson, they tried to slip a paper in to his sign-out papers after he served his three years in the Air Force, and they tried to slip a paper in with him re-signing back up.
[00:38:16.001 --> 00:38:19.285]  Also, they're trying to force people whose contracts say they're out to go back.
[00:38:19.565 --> 00:38:24.070]  They're calling high school kids up and saying, you'll go to jail if you don't come sign up in the military.
[00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:25.371]  That's been on the news.
[00:38:25.591 --> 00:38:26.913]  I mean, how bad is this, Corey?
[00:38:28.087 --> 00:38:28.868]  It's terrible.
[00:38:29.008 --> 00:38:31.169]  It's just not ending.
[00:38:31.469 --> 00:38:33.991]  Like I said, they can't meet the requirements that they need.
[00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:40.436]  They have more re-enlistment NCOs out there, more enlistment, more guys out there on the streets trying to recruit people.
[00:38:40.976 --> 00:38:44.118]  It's just not working for them because the American people see
[00:38:45.479 --> 00:38:53.223]  How the Iraq War is progressing, how it's not going anywhere, how our soldiers continue to keep dying, and you know, no one's signing up, and who could blame them?
[00:38:53.283 --> 00:38:56.424]  I mean, who would voluntarily want to sign up to fight in this war?
[00:38:56.524 --> 00:39:06.509]  I mean, it's unjust, it was built on lies, and we're losing more American lives and Iraqi lives, everything, human lives are being lost every minute over there, and it's criminal.
[00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:17.133]  Now, you've never really talked publicly on air, but if you could just briefly about, tell me, tell the Lizards the same thing, just in a nutshell, of what you witnessed in your time guarding the hospital.
[00:39:18.734 --> 00:39:20.715]  Oh man, guarding the hospital in Baghdad?
[00:39:21.715 --> 00:39:23.456]  Yeah, that was a rough time.
[00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:30.470]  I sat right there at the entry doors in Baghdad, in the medical city of Baghdad, because all their hospitals are centralized in one location.
[00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:38.073]  And my job was to sit at the emergency room doors and guard the emergency room from anybody who was trying to get in who might cause a problem.
[00:39:38.613 --> 00:39:40.974]  And that was probably one of the hardest things I ever had to do.
[00:39:41.434 --> 00:39:50.522]  Because, I mean, they would just wheel in, you know, body after body after body of Iraqi civilians, Iraqi children, families who were just blown to smithereens.
[00:39:50.702 --> 00:39:58.709]  There were houses collapsed on top of them because the military accidentally bombed their house or bombed a nearby building and that building fell onto their building.
[00:39:59.149 --> 00:40:02.732]  And, I mean, just seeing families just screaming at the top of their lungs.
[00:40:03.092 --> 00:40:06.533]  Just asking why and asking, you know, why this is happening to them.
[00:40:06.613 --> 00:40:11.174]  I mean, that was probably the roughest, roughest thing, you know, I've really ever had to sit through.
[00:40:11.194 --> 00:40:20.436]  And at the same time, these fathers of our evacuee children who would come in and they would say, their children would pass me without an arm or without a leg or without half of their head.
[00:40:20.936 --> 00:40:27.218]  And then their father would sit next to me, who spoke English, and ask me, Soldier, why are you doing this to my family?
[00:40:27.722 --> 00:40:31.584]  And it's, you know, it's not the soldiers, it's just we're there doing our job.
[00:40:31.845 --> 00:40:37.368]  And see, if I was an Iraqi, I'm sorry, even though you were a good guy, Corey, I would have just started attacking people.
[00:40:38.249 --> 00:40:39.790]  And I guess that's what the Iraqis are doing.
[00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:41.190]  Well, absolutely.
[00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:46.794]  I mean, and Alex, I don't, I just want to say, if anybody ever invaded this country, it would
[00:40:47.682 --> 00:40:49.063]  It would turn out very much the same.
[00:40:49.284 --> 00:40:54.028]  You know, everyone is trying to defend their homeland and protect their little piece of life and livelihood.
[00:40:54.509 --> 00:40:56.811]  And what's going on over there is unjust.
[00:40:56.911 --> 00:40:57.472]  It's criminal.
[00:40:57.812 --> 00:40:58.793]  It was built on lies.
[00:40:58.973 --> 00:41:01.175]  I mean, we need to withdraw immediately.
[00:41:01.495 --> 00:41:07.061]  And real quick, just off on a subject, I'm down here and I read the Army Times newspaper.
[00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:13.183]  And it is just so full of propaganda, just feeding these soldiers the information that they want to hear.
[00:41:13.403 --> 00:41:17.945]  They're telling them that they're going to start withdrawing in January of the coming year.
[00:41:17.965 --> 00:41:18.945]  They say that every year!
[00:41:19.165 --> 00:41:20.105]  They say that every year!
[00:41:20.666 --> 00:41:25.227]  They keep telling them that they're going to get raises, and that their benefits are going to get increased, and da-da-da-da-da.
[00:41:25.587 --> 00:41:30.969]  And so many of these soldiers down here are really starting to wake up to it, and I mean, just really getting absolutely fed up.
[00:41:31.385 --> 00:41:32.546]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:41:32.566 --> 00:41:34.267]  Like I said, there's people that have been voluntarily extended
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:42:09.817]  You know, for years now, like I said, up to two years, and there's so many people that I know from when I was here years ago that are still here, still doing, still in some, in the same position, still hoping that they can get out, still hoping that the military will release them, and you know, some people, they just don't let go, and they just try to keep and fight and claw and hold everyone there.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:26.347]  Okay, I want to let you go, because I know you're very busy, but first, just nutshell, go through what actually happened, when the police came, how they were called, how they were given the warrant, you know, how they turned the lines off, all the things that happened, and then what you witnessed once you got to Fort Drum.
[00:42:27.347 --> 00:42:29.388]  I mean, just give us a play-by-play nutshell.
[00:42:29.588 --> 00:42:30.229]  Sure, sure, sure.
[00:42:30.369 --> 00:42:36.672]  I mean, sitting there Monday night, 1045 at night, me and the guys are sitting around just watching TV, hanging out.
[00:42:37.072 --> 00:42:39.433]  I hear, doom, doom, doom, you know, a cop knock on the door.
[00:42:40.129 --> 00:42:41.509]  I went immediately to the door.
[00:42:41.529 --> 00:42:44.470]  I saw numerous sheriffs, at least four.
[00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:46.650]  I'm pretty sure there was five outside my door.
[00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:48.790]  Went outside to talk to them, see what was up.
[00:42:49.051 --> 00:42:50.271]  They said they had a warrant for my arrest.
[00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:55.572]  At that time, I started seeing an officer coming from the rear wood line of my house, towards my house.
[00:42:55.592 --> 00:42:59.452]  He was in my backyard, and in the wood line, and coming towards me.
[00:42:59.512 --> 00:43:00.472]  And they all surrounded me.
[00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:03.813]  And they're asking me, you know, if I was AWOL, and dah, dah, dah, dah.
[00:43:03.853 --> 00:43:05.153]  And I said, no, I have my paperwork.
[00:43:05.473 --> 00:43:06.393]  I took them into my house.
[00:43:06.453 --> 00:43:07.414]  I invited them into my house.
[00:43:07.874 --> 00:43:09.234]  I gave them the paperwork.
[00:43:09.614 --> 00:43:11.915]  They called and they tried.
[00:43:11.935 --> 00:43:15.956]  They went through the paperwork and they said, you know, that you still have an active warrant.
[00:43:16.636 --> 00:43:17.397]  We have to take you.
[00:43:17.437 --> 00:43:18.057]  So they took me.
[00:43:18.577 --> 00:43:23.238]  An hour later, I was in a jail cell in Otsego County Correctional Facility in a jumpsuit and everything.
[00:43:23.659 --> 00:43:26.259]  I sat there for a day and a half and then Ford Drum came to pick me up.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.861]  On my way up to Ford Drum, I pulled out my paperwork and I started to talk to him about it.
[00:43:31.235 --> 00:43:38.082]  And these guys, the Department of the Army officer and the MP that came to escort me up to Fort Drum, were just simply blown away.
[00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:39.404]  I mean, just simply blown away.
[00:43:39.424 --> 00:43:40.965]  I mean, it's right there.
[00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:43.068]  I was given my DD-214 18 months ago.
[00:43:43.488 --> 00:43:44.770]  It's right there in black and white.
[00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.092]  I mean, so we got to Fort Drum.
[00:43:47.112 --> 00:43:48.594]  They immediately took the cuffs off me.
[00:43:48.994 --> 00:43:50.796]  They actually offered to buy me lunch.
[00:43:52.458 --> 00:43:56.022]  So I'm sitting there, I'm talking to everybody, and all of a sudden the phone just starts ringing.
[00:43:56.042 --> 00:43:56.863]  The phone starts ringing.
[00:43:56.883 --> 00:44:07.775]  I mean, I'm sitting there, and the phone's ringing, and the answering machine all of a sudden goes, Hello, this is so-and-so from .com, and I'm sorry, I'm trying to get in touch with Corey Rowe to see if I can verify, and I picked up the phone, and I was like, This is Corey Rowe.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.941]  I mean, just the amount of phone calls I got.
[00:44:10.242 --> 00:44:12.443]  The captain in charge came in and he's like, who are you?
[00:44:12.463 --> 00:44:14.205]  He's like, who are these people calling for you?
[00:44:14.225 --> 00:44:23.272]  And I was like, you know, I kind of helped make a little movie a little while ago, and there are people that are concerned with my well-being and other people's well-being, like myself.
[00:44:23.332 --> 00:44:27.675]  But either way, I went and I got a plane ticket immediately to fly out that afternoon.
[00:44:28.175 --> 00:44:30.918]  Flew from there to Boston, and then from Boston down here to Kentucky.
[00:44:31.498 --> 00:44:37.923]  Came down to the base, and you know, I'm down here just trying to take care of this, make sure it goes through the paperwork, make sure that everything's clear.
[00:44:38.536 --> 00:44:40.817]  And hopefully get back home before Laugh-Fest.
[00:44:42.598 --> 00:44:58.924]  Now, just looking at this, the probability is, and you've got different branches of the government, is that that little investigative trip up to the Northeastern Air Defense System with your car, with somebody else driving it from the crew, triggered calls made and then somehow they
[00:44:59.444 --> 00:45:12.235]  Trump this up because the police say yeah, we never have these warrants just appear Then the military called us and they won't say who that was But then the arm that's military police and the deals with people that are AWOL or deserters.
[00:45:12.255 --> 00:45:25.326]  They're like you're not a deserter This is this is just absolutely amazing and then Fox News admits they check at the base and It is showing that you'd been honorably discharged.
[00:45:25.386 --> 00:45:27.428]  So was this just an attempt to
[00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:44.960]  I mean, I know you're trying to play it down and just end it, and you just, you know, I mean, you always do that, Corey, whenever I see you and other bad stuff's happening, you go, everything's fine, but I mean, getting past that tendency, and I've seen that with so many other people I know, which is generally a good trait, but, you know, not to be a whiner, but this is pretty suspicious, Corey.
[00:45:45.761 --> 00:45:48.162]  It is, it is suspicious, but at the same time,
[00:45:48.738 --> 00:45:51.641]  I really don't feel that there was any nefarious purposes behind this.
[00:45:51.802 --> 00:46:01.032]  I believe that, you know, whatever happened with my car up at Neabs and them running my license plate and however that came back, but at the same time I can't say that either because
[00:46:02.608 --> 00:46:05.390]  It's so crazy, but again, this is not an isolated incident.
[00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.371]  I am not the only person that they are doing this to.
[00:46:07.771 --> 00:46:11.254]  I mean, they're doing this to soldiers across the country who have been out of the service for years.
[00:46:11.274 --> 00:46:13.415]  They're doing everything... Well, stay there right there for a minute.
[00:46:13.455 --> 00:46:16.477]  Weldon Henson could have just come in the studio, but he's in the next room calling in.
[00:46:17.858 --> 00:46:21.301]  Weldon, obviously listening in the next room, wanted to comment on this, and I'm glad he did.
[00:46:21.481 --> 00:46:22.742]  Weldon, you're on the air with Cory Rowe.
[00:46:23.302 --> 00:46:24.203]  Hey, how's it going, man?
[00:46:24.623 --> 00:46:24.823]  Good.
[00:46:24.843 --> 00:46:26.084]  You wanted to comment.
[00:46:26.104 --> 00:46:30.107]  I mean, tell folks about how they tried to slip that into your sheet to re-up you.
[00:46:30.911 --> 00:46:35.093]  Oh, well, no, it was more, you know, I did my six years, and of course, you know, you always... Six years, yeah.
[00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:39.815]  And you go, and then they make it, well, you have to do your last two years of inactive reserve.
[00:46:40.375 --> 00:46:52.640]  Well, you know, I went to sign out the last day of my active status, and they tried to flick a, you know, slide another year on that inactive reserve on me, and then when I pointed it out, at first, they just were like, well, you know, what's the big deal?
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:57.742]  And I said, no, you need to change it, and then they act like it was, you know, letting me see why I wanted to change.
[00:46:57.802 --> 00:46:58.542]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:46:58.602 --> 00:47:00.483]  They falsified the contract.
[00:47:01.181 --> 00:47:02.241]  Yeah, basically.
[00:47:02.281 --> 00:47:04.642]  And I caught it though, because I've heard about it.
[00:47:04.662 --> 00:47:08.102]  You really have to pay attention to what you're signing, especially when you're getting out.
[00:47:08.182 --> 00:47:13.983]  Even when you're getting in, anybody that's thinking about going in, you really have to pay attention because they will rake you over the coals.
[00:47:14.584 --> 00:47:17.624]  That's the attitude, that's the mindset that they have.
[00:47:17.644 --> 00:47:20.865]  They're like, what does it matter if you have an extra year in the NAC reserve?
[00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:22.245]  They're probably not going to call you anyway.
[00:47:22.485 --> 00:47:26.146]  They just like to have that attitude, like, oh it's no big deal, we're just trying to
[00:47:27.364 --> 00:47:29.665]  Screw you over right here, and that's no big deal.
[00:47:29.685 --> 00:47:30.406]  Don't worry about it.
[00:47:30.506 --> 00:47:32.327]  That's the mindset of some of these attention-watchers.
[00:47:32.347 --> 00:47:37.309]  That's the mindset, and I caught him on it, and then they just were looking at it like I was crazy.
[00:47:37.369 --> 00:47:38.069]  Like, what?
[00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:38.870]  What's the big deal?
[00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:40.351]  I mean, I don't see why you wouldn't want to.
[00:47:40.371 --> 00:47:45.173]  Well, Weldon, I want to get you on at least for ten minutes later today before Jerome Corsi comes on.
[00:47:45.273 --> 00:47:53.837]  Side issue about everybody you know saying that they're gearing up with the aircraft carriers to attack Iran because you've got a lot of sources in the Air Force just getting out.
[00:47:54.098 --> 00:47:54.678]  Thank you, Weldon.
[00:47:55.545 --> 00:47:55.885]  Thank you.
[00:47:56.105 --> 00:47:56.466]  You bet.
[00:47:56.626 --> 00:47:57.546]  There's Weldon Henson.
[00:47:57.966 --> 00:48:01.108]  Now, I'm going to have him in studio later today.
[00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:12.473]  I want to just spend five minutes on what everybody in the Air Force is telling him because they're actually deploying for full tours now with the Air Force in countries triangulating on Iran saying they're going in.
[00:48:13.194 --> 00:48:23.779]  But in closing, Corey, again I want to thank you for your courage and I want to thank you for the great job on Loose Change Final Cut that is really getting polished up and some incredible interviews that
[00:48:24.399 --> 00:48:26.941]  We'll have you on later to talk about when we break all that.
[00:48:27.602 --> 00:48:29.283]  But what are they saying?
[00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:32.566]  How long it'll take for them to recheck your paperwork and finally get you out of there?
[00:48:33.307 --> 00:48:40.152]  Well, there's a possibility I might even have to go to a different base to take care of this because right now they can't locate me in their system.
[00:48:40.612 --> 00:48:48.299]  So there's a possibility that I'm going to have to drive up to Fort Knox and go into their actual... that's where they house a lot of their files in their system and stuff.
[00:48:48.319 --> 00:48:50.941]  So there's a possibility I might have to drive up there next week.
[00:48:51.321 --> 00:48:53.802]  But hopefully this isn't going to take more than another week or two.
[00:48:53.822 --> 00:49:04.128]  By the way, I've had a friend, an employee, arrested for expired driver's license, and when he goes to court to fix it twice, they say it doesn't exist in the system here in Austin.
[00:49:04.328 --> 00:49:08.450]  So this is happening more and more, where it just doesn't even matter.
[00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.311]  I mean, this is la-la land.
[00:49:11.331 --> 00:49:11.912]  It is.
[00:49:12.172 --> 00:49:13.352]  It's crazy and criminal, Alex.
[00:49:13.412 --> 00:49:15.714]  And again, thank you everybody out there for all your support.
[00:49:16.134 --> 00:49:20.176]  I really got a chuckle out of the free Cory Rowe icons that I've seen all over the internet.
[00:49:20.752 --> 00:49:23.754]  And I appreciate everyone's support, and I love you all.
[00:49:23.774 --> 00:49:25.094]  God bless, and you're all my prayers.
[00:49:25.134 --> 00:49:27.315]  Do you think the phone calls got you out of Fort Drum quicker?
[00:49:27.335 --> 00:49:28.656]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:49:28.696 --> 00:49:29.376]  No question about it.
[00:49:29.676 --> 00:49:30.517]  All right, my friend.
[00:49:30.677 --> 00:49:33.558]  We'll check in with you next week as this develops.
[00:49:33.658 --> 00:49:34.919]  Are you back in uniform now?
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.481]  I was in uniform this morning, but I've been released for the day.
[00:49:38.581 --> 00:49:41.142]  My company is already off, so I'm going to go jump in a pool somewhere.
[00:49:41.522 --> 00:49:41.802]  All right.
[00:49:41.842 --> 00:49:42.603]  Take care, my friend.
[00:49:42.623 --> 00:49:43.583]  All right.
[00:49:43.603 --> 00:49:43.963]  You too.
[00:49:43.983 --> 00:49:44.604]  You too, Commander.
[00:49:44.624 --> 00:49:45.324]  I'll talk to you soon.
[00:49:45.464 --> 00:49:47.385]  All right.
[00:49:47.445 --> 00:49:48.406]  There goes Corey Rowe.
[00:49:48.426 --> 00:49:49.166]  What a great guy.
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.401]  Oh man, he is something else.
[00:49:52.961 --> 00:49:55.243]  All right, we're going to break and come back.
[00:49:55.283 --> 00:49:58.424]  He's going directly to the swimming pool where the young ladies are at.
[00:49:59.165 --> 00:50:02.987]  You can be absolutely sure he's something else, man.
[00:50:03.807 --> 00:50:11.811]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we get back into the really serious, sad issue of Pat Tillman murdered by the government, murdered by the military.
[00:50:12.431 --> 00:50:15.893]  It's now Keith Overman saying it, just saying it looks like this is what happened.
[00:50:16.353 --> 00:50:17.534]  Looks like we've gone in the wrong direction.
[00:50:17.554 --> 00:50:19.695]  This is cold-blooded murder, then it goes all the way to the top.
[00:50:21.289 --> 00:50:24.212]  And next, you'll see neocons say that Pat Tillman's a coward.
[00:50:24.472 --> 00:50:33.319]  You'll probably see, I'm not knocking fat people, I'm a little overweight myself, but you'll see the obese drug addict Rush Limbaugh probably calling him a coward and saying he didn't fight hard enough.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.582]  You'll probably see that chicken-haunt Karl Rove doing it, or George Bush.
[00:50:38.283 --> 00:50:41.646]  They're cowardly, degenerate, chicken-necked scum.
[00:50:42.432 --> 00:50:48.219]  And they're using our military and our police and our government to dismantle our republic, dismantle our borders.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:57.331]  The same people running these illegal wars are doing it to kill our name worldwide, while grabbing the oil, and to set up a domestic police state here and get rid of our borders.
[00:50:57.792 --> 00:50:58.392]  You see that?
[00:50:58.693 --> 00:50:59.454]  They're the enemy!
[00:50:59.474 --> 00:51:00.255]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.452 --> 00:51:04.912]  It's here.
[00:51:05.133 --> 00:51:09.916]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.276 --> 00:51:17.921]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.624 --> 00:51:25.647]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.067 --> 00:51:37.492]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.792 --> 00:51:41.314]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.774 --> 00:51:43.695]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.035 --> 00:51:47.877]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.377 --> 00:52:04.539]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.579 --> 00:52:08.621]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.761 --> 00:52:11.303]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.383 --> 00:52:13.704]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:13.904 --> 00:52:22.329]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:23.710]  The Brookie Light is different.
[00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:27.892]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:27.912 --> 00:52:28.372]  We're good to go!
[00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:48.986]  Hey Emily!
[00:52:49.066 --> 00:52:49.546]  Wow, you look great!
[00:53:03.627 --> 00:53:04.427]  I feel great.
[00:53:04.688 --> 00:53:06.608]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:53:06.989 --> 00:53:07.309]  Really?
[00:53:07.489 --> 00:53:07.949]  What is it?
[00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.529]  How does it work?
[00:53:08.669 --> 00:53:15.612]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[00:53:15.932 --> 00:53:18.193]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:53:18.574 --> 00:53:23.696]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:53:24.196 --> 00:53:24.677]  That's it?
[00:53:24.917 --> 00:53:26.499]  Well it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:53:26.819 --> 00:53:27.520]  It is easy.
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:34.467]  Plus the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:53:34.747 --> 00:53:36.089]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:53:36.289 --> 00:53:37.070]  That's amazing!
[00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:42.756]  And the bendenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:53:43.016 --> 00:53:43.317]  Wow!
[00:53:43.497 --> 00:53:44.578]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:53:44.998 --> 00:53:48.021]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:53:48.101 --> 00:53:51.984]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:53:52.204 --> 00:53:52.684]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[00:53:52.704 --> 00:53:52.945]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:54:16.788 --> 00:54:18.990]  Oh yeah, Pat Tillman sure did.
[00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:23.532]  One of the only survivors from Jessica Lynch Unit.
[00:54:23.672 --> 00:54:28.055]  Who said, wait a minute.
[00:54:28.175 --> 00:54:31.898]  And some of the rescue team.
[00:54:46.385 --> 00:54:46.985]  Wait a minute.
[00:54:47.045 --> 00:54:48.086]  She cowered in fear.
[00:54:48.126 --> 00:54:50.907]  It was these guys that fought the Iraqis 10-1.
[00:54:51.647 --> 00:54:53.588]  Well, that's not how the story goes.
[00:54:54.148 --> 00:54:57.049]  And if you speak out, you get double-tapped to the head.
[00:54:57.729 --> 00:55:03.491]  Someone in a black uniform and black mask pops up with precision and double-taps you.
[00:55:03.511 --> 00:55:08.813]  It's just one thing to be able to double-tap a target at 20 yards away with a rifle when you're not nervous.
[00:55:08.833 --> 00:55:09.333]  That's easy.
[00:55:09.393 --> 00:55:13.975]  But to murder someone, you see, to isolate double-tap,
[00:55:15.803 --> 00:55:21.045]  To isolate from less than 10 yards away, shoot Pat Tillman three times in the forehead.
[00:55:22.105 --> 00:55:24.566]  See, getting around his helmet, his Kevlar helmet.
[00:55:27.047 --> 00:55:30.349]  To see, first shooting at about 30 yards away.
[00:55:30.889 --> 00:55:34.150]  When he falls down behind a rock, begins screaming, I'm Pat Tillman, cease fire.
[00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:36.571]  Holds the hand up, they shoot that off.
[00:55:37.711 --> 00:55:39.352]  Behave yourself, Pat, we're coming.
[00:55:39.972 --> 00:55:44.014]  And then, oh, you're going to pop up now, as they continue to fire on his
[00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:47.911]  Position, and then shoot him in the head.
[00:55:49.171 --> 00:55:50.511]  And then make him the big hero.
[00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:55.612]  Our fallen hero, Pat Tillman, who loved George Bush.
[00:55:57.212 --> 00:55:59.653]  Oh yes, he is a fallen hero.
[00:55:59.673 --> 00:56:03.793]  There they are, Whitman, Price, and Adad, basking in the Maui sun.
[00:56:04.193 --> 00:56:07.414]  Their debt to society, paid in full.
[00:56:07.474 --> 00:56:13.435]  And now, tonight, on The Running Man, who loves you, and who do you love?
[00:56:14.085 --> 00:56:15.087]  Going for broke.
[00:56:15.147 --> 00:56:17.550]  It's the mad dog, Ben Richards.
[00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:21.675]  The brutal slayer of 50 men, women, and children.
[00:56:21.955 --> 00:56:24.919]  And he'll be facing Sub-Zero!
[00:56:24.939 --> 00:56:29.024]  I mean, that's literally what all this is.
[00:56:29.144 --> 00:56:32.428]  It is complete, total propaganda.
[00:56:34.998 --> 00:56:38.280]  I mean, if they'll kill the President right in front of everybody, they'll kill Pat Tillman.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:43.123]  And he did write in his diary, because he had written to his mother that he had written this in his diary.
[00:56:43.504 --> 00:56:44.764]  We have copies of it here.
[00:56:44.824 --> 00:56:47.326]  His brother had written how they were going to come back and be anti-war.
[00:56:48.247 --> 00:56:49.728]  They had told his unit.
[00:56:50.268 --> 00:56:52.129]  That's even mainstream news!
[00:56:52.149 --> 00:56:54.270]  That, man, we need to get out of here as soon as possible.
[00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.531]  This is a complete baloney.
[00:56:56.852 --> 00:56:58.213]  Because he wasn't stupid.
[00:56:58.273 --> 00:57:00.074]  He was there in Iraq and then Afghanistan.
[00:57:00.094 --> 00:57:01.955]  He was like, this is a complete joke!
[00:57:03.036 --> 00:57:04.297]  We're not here for these people!
[00:57:05.433 --> 00:57:32.943]  guarding opium fields and they murdered him now I know it's old news here and it's been hidden in plain view but the point is now new army reports from the doctors who had first complained of publications that they believe he was murdered now they've released that in the in the in the in the lawyers bragging about the cover-up and how they kept army investigators out but didn't stop that colonel from first saying we believe this was a homicide
[00:57:33.812 --> 00:57:35.113]  The Army isn't all bad people.
[00:57:35.453 --> 00:57:36.394]  Not yet, see.
[00:57:36.634 --> 00:57:38.696]  That's why they can't have total martial law yet.
[00:57:38.936 --> 00:57:41.358]  They've got to shell you on being evil first.
[00:57:41.698 --> 00:57:49.185]  That's why law enforcement magazines and TV shows and all these role modeling programs teach you that evil and cheating and torture is good.
[00:57:49.585 --> 00:57:52.087]  And lying and... Oh, because we're doing it for a greater good.
[00:57:53.445 --> 00:58:04.793]  In Delta Force, it doesn't matter if you pass all the physical and mental stuff, at the end you've got to read Machiavelli's The Prince in eight hours, and you've got to write then in another eight hours a lengthy essay.
[00:58:05.233 --> 00:58:06.073]  This is now admitted.
[00:58:06.093 --> 00:58:13.398]  I remember first hearing Limbaugh brag about it ten years ago and how they understood In Justifies the Means and how much he loved Delta Force.
[00:58:13.758 --> 00:58:16.440]  Then I talked to some Delta Force people about it, and then I saw it in the news.
[00:58:17.221 --> 00:58:21.984]  And if they answer, In Justifies the Means, being evil is good for a greater good,
[00:58:22.802 --> 00:58:24.222]  Then they graduate.
[00:58:25.143 --> 00:58:28.444]  If they don't, sorry, you didn't make Delta.
[00:58:29.344 --> 00:58:34.865]  But if you go to Waco and murder children, you've made Delta Force, my boy.
[00:58:34.885 --> 00:58:38.346]  And of course, later they flush the Delta Force people down the toilet, too.
[00:58:38.726 --> 00:58:39.447]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.127 --> 00:58:46.008]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.609 --> 00:58:58.269]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.930 --> 00:58:59.990]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.691 --> 00:59:01.831]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.452 --> 00:59:03.292]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.032 --> 00:59:04.913]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.933 --> 00:59:09.575]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.775 --> 00:59:13.898]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.938 --> 00:59:21.982]  Well, now Keith Olbermann and Wesley Clark on national television are talking about the White House ordering the murder of Pat Tillman.
[00:59:24.648 --> 00:59:28.009]  I don't think we've ever been closer to the government staging a terror attack.
[00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:30.029]  Criminals have run it to smoke screen everything.
[00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:32.309]  We'll talk more about this in the next 30 minutes.
[00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:51.853]  Then we've got Jerome Corsi joining us for a full hour with huge new developments in the North American Union that have been coming out in the last few days as they prepare for the big meeting in Canada where any one period for 18 miles, 25 kilometers, isn't even allowed into a major city, large town of hundreds of thousands.
[00:59:52.558 --> 01:00:00.364]  You just, everyone's checked, checkpoints, no one's allowed in, if you can't show your business, no demonstration, no protest allowed.
[01:00:01.285 --> 01:00:12.913]  And then meanwhile, Fox News yesterday attacks this young lady, Jessica Wilson, from Houston 9-11 Truth, great lady, and says, okay, what's wrong with the North American Union and Amero?
[01:00:12.973 --> 01:00:13.834]  We need it!
[01:00:13.854 --> 01:00:15.275]  I actually have it on tape!
[01:00:15.956 --> 01:00:19.038]  But then they go on to say she's still a conspiracy theorist, it doesn't exist.
[01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:29.273]  They literally say it's good, and we need it, but that she is evil, and that it doesn't exist.
[01:00:30.234 --> 01:00:33.176]  Man, that is psych warfare right out of the gates of hell.
[01:00:33.376 --> 01:00:37.619]  And I mean, I'm getting to the point now... In fact, I think I forgot to upload that to the network.
[01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:39.060]  Did, uh... I didn't tell Aaron to.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.582]  Did Aaron... Can you... I don't know if he's in the report.
[01:00:42.582 --> 01:00:43.623]  Can you go to Jon's report?
[01:00:45.012 --> 01:00:48.515]  It's a clip of John Gibson's Fox Radio Show.
[01:00:48.975 --> 01:01:02.344]  When they had her on, they had some other trollop doing the show, and some other little pansy, and some other little sellout, soulless piece of garbage, and they get her on there.
[01:01:02.364 --> 01:01:08.748]  We might as well play that now, because she's joining us the last 30 minutes, last 20 minutes or so, and we can have her on to comment, but they edit the video.
[01:01:09.929 --> 01:01:13.131]  Because she comes up, well, you know what, I'll talk about it when we get back from the break.
[01:01:14.503 --> 01:01:17.524]  Again, it isn't just about her or Fox.
[01:01:17.584 --> 01:01:20.844]  It's a case example of their lying and twisting.
[01:01:22.685 --> 01:01:31.846]  Because they take her, politely asking the question about the CFR, and then call her a crazy conspiracy theorist and play the noise of black helicopters and say it doesn't exist, basically.
[01:01:32.926 --> 01:01:34.267]  But then say it does and it's good.
[01:01:35.127 --> 01:01:36.227]  And then they add it together.
[01:01:36.267 --> 01:01:37.807]  They go, but she wasn't done!
[01:01:39.067 --> 01:01:40.548]  After he politely answered her question.
[01:01:40.888 --> 01:01:41.788]  Then she did this.
[01:01:43.141 --> 01:01:45.983]  They cut to her yelling and screaming.
[01:01:46.343 --> 01:01:59.932]  That's after two cops grab her, sandwich her, pressing their chest into hers, and with looks of enjoyment on their faces, by the way, we have this up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, and drag her out and then ask, what's wrong?
[01:02:00.172 --> 01:02:02.294]  We're just dragging you and sandwiching you between us.
[01:02:02.494 --> 01:02:03.515]  What's wrong?
[01:02:03.735 --> 01:02:04.996]  What's wrong?
[01:02:05.476 --> 01:02:06.617]  What's wrong?
[01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:08.358]  Don't get excited.
[01:02:09.678 --> 01:02:14.681]  And then she gets outside and Thompson's leaving and they don't even let her go over and ask more questions with reporters chasing after her.
[01:02:14.701 --> 01:02:16.522]  Reporters chase after her and ask questions!
[01:02:16.722 --> 01:02:17.582]  That's the way it used to be!
[01:02:18.082 --> 01:02:20.324]  But see, now they don't even need cops in the Rose Garden.
[01:02:20.864 --> 01:02:24.886]  A Chinese doctor, member of the press, during the press conference brings up organ harvesting.
[01:02:26.408 --> 01:02:32.673]  And they begin just grabbing her face, just like the Night of the Living Dead, just hands, just reach up and envelop her.
[01:02:32.753 --> 01:02:33.294]  No!
[01:02:33.674 --> 01:02:34.915]  No, we're slaves!
[01:02:34.955 --> 01:02:36.016]  Don't ask them that!
[01:02:36.296 --> 01:02:37.557]  We don't wanna hear!
[01:02:37.998 --> 01:02:39.619]  We wanna be scum!
[01:02:40.159 --> 01:02:45.184]  We wanna be slaves in the land of the cowardly, decadent idiot!
[01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:55.212]  Again, you've ruined our country, a land peopled with pot-bellied, slack-jawed, beaver-eyed scum!
[01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:59.350]  Just rats everywhere!
[01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:04.952]  Little, greedy, backstabbing, wicked, self-centered scum everywhere!
[01:03:04.972 --> 01:03:13.015]  And then you see good people like shining lights on a mountain, and you just run at us like a pack of drooling zombies!
[01:03:14.935 --> 01:03:16.216]  Alright, I'm being a little mean there.
[01:03:16.316 --> 01:03:17.976]  I'm just... I've had it!
[01:03:19.277 --> 01:03:20.157]  Everywhere I go, man!
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.622]  You can have a video camera out in Austin and a cop will walk over and go, turn that off!
[01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:27.083]  Well, no, I'm here videotaping, uh... No!
[01:03:27.223 --> 01:03:28.344]  I said it!
[01:03:28.364 --> 01:03:28.724]  I said it!
[01:03:29.885 --> 01:03:32.626]  Unless they know who I am, or they're nice cops.
[01:03:32.786 --> 01:03:34.067]  But the point is, there's always a bad one.
[01:03:34.988 --> 01:03:36.168]  And it's even worse in New York.
[01:03:36.188 --> 01:03:37.349]  They'll be humiliated!
[01:03:37.369 --> 01:03:39.050]  They'll be treated like scum!
[01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:44.533]  And the illegal aliens don't even have to have a driver's license and they let them go on DWIs.
[01:03:45.233 --> 01:03:47.975]  But I don't even have my basic Bill of Rights.
[01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:50.036]  And you do this to a young woman?
[01:03:56.172 --> 01:04:01.662]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.023 --> 01:04:09.616]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.345 --> 01:04:17.388]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:29.213]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:33.474]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:35.455]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.755 --> 01:04:39.597]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:25.218 --> 01:05:28.719]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:05:52.806 --> 01:05:55.307]  Do you know that you can go solar for under $1,200 bucks now?
[01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:56.947]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:05:57.147 --> 01:06:01.309]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:06:01.889 --> 01:06:06.791]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:06:07.291 --> 01:06:13.713]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[01:06:14.469 --> 01:06:17.170]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:27.292]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:06:27.552 --> 01:06:31.272]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:06:31.312 --> 01:06:37.814]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.034]  Are you ready to go solar?
[01:06:39.234 --> 01:06:40.174]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[01:06:44.095 --> 01:06:48.138]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[01:06:48.399 --> 01:06:50.760]  That's KenSolar.com.
[01:06:53.362 --> 01:06:58.967]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:58.987 --> 01:07:02.229]  We got Jerome Corsi in 20 minutes.
[01:07:08.428 --> 01:07:13.632]  Dr. Korsi in about 22-23 minutes for another report of all these new North American Union developments.
[01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:29.904]  Then, in the last 30 minutes of the show, I'm going to play that Fox News clip where they're savagely attacking Jessica Wilson, who founded Houston 9-11 Truth, for going out and just asking serious questions to the fake conservative Fred Thompson, and then the whole media spin that surrounded that.
[01:07:30.484 --> 01:07:34.407]  We're going to be documenting that with her coming up later.
[01:07:34.768 --> 01:07:37.550]  There is a big report up on JonesReport.com
[01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:39.451]  Before I do that, we have a new sponsor.
[01:07:39.511 --> 01:07:41.951]  You've heard them on the network.
[01:07:41.971 --> 01:07:44.672]  I've got friends and neighbors that have gotten it.
[01:07:44.692 --> 01:07:49.734]  I'm one of these people that likes to turn the AC down to about 65, but my wife doesn't like it.
[01:08:08.426 --> 01:08:13.650]  And, uh, so what I tend to do is just sleep on top of the sheets and she sleeps under them.
[01:08:14.871 --> 01:08:18.014]  Well, I tell you what everybody I know is doing and I just got it and I'm going to try it.
[01:08:18.034 --> 01:08:20.416]  Uh, but everybody I know says it works really great.
[01:08:20.436 --> 01:08:24.959]  I've been so busy I've had it for about a month and haven't tried it yet, but I'm told they're just amazing.
[01:08:25.259 --> 01:08:31.944]  It just hooks into your bed and it shoots air underneath the covers and, uh, it's, it's just sweeping the country.
[01:08:31.984 --> 01:08:32.945]  It's very, very popular.
[01:08:32.965 --> 01:08:34.466]  A lot of folks in Austin have it.
[01:08:34.506 --> 01:08:35.107]  It's the bed fan.
[01:08:36.221 --> 01:08:41.943]  And you really need to visit their website, ladies and gentlemen, at BedFan.com.
[01:08:43.023 --> 01:08:44.304]  It's from Tompkins Research.
[01:08:44.864 --> 01:08:46.324]  It's really inexpensive, by the way.
[01:08:46.424 --> 01:08:48.565]  B-E-D-F-A-N.com.
[01:08:48.925 --> 01:08:54.507]  And it's just designed a little fan that just sets into the side of your bed.
[01:08:54.527 --> 01:08:55.227]  You don't even see it.
[01:08:55.994 --> 01:08:56.835]  And it's amazing.
[01:08:57.215 --> 01:09:04.441]  BedFan.com or give them a call at 210-632-8280.
[01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:07.904]  Go check it out at BedFan.com 210-632-8280.
[01:09:07.924 --> 01:09:14.789]  Night sweats due to menopause, medical conditions, or medications.
[01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:18.852]  Actually, for any reason, the BedFan will stop all night sweats, guaranteed.
[01:09:18.872 --> 01:09:22.535]  And it's just very, very interesting.
[01:09:23.536 --> 01:09:23.836]  You can
[01:09:24.913 --> 01:09:33.136]  Get as much as 25 monthly savings by lowering how high you turn the thermostat up at night, how cold you have the AC.
[01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:38.478]  Like I said, you can also set it for one side of the bed if your spouse likes to swelter in heat.
[01:09:38.918 --> 01:09:43.140]  This is something I absolutely hate and I intend to use it.
[01:09:44.355 --> 01:09:50.002]  And it goes on to say, pays for itself by saving on your electric bill, works instantly, no tools or assembly required.
[01:09:50.263 --> 01:09:55.329]  The BedFan 210-632-8280 or BedFan.com.
[01:09:56.150 --> 01:10:00.776]  And remember, our sponsors not only have great products, they also make this broadcast possible.
[01:10:02.233 --> 01:10:21.587]  Speaking of sponsors, no one is a bigger sponsor than our own books and videos, and not just the films I've made, or the book I wrote, or the book we carry, but all the other videos that people have produced, like America, Freedom to Fascism, you get the high-quality original actually from Aaron Russo, so that goes to support him when you buy from us, not all the bootlegs that are out there.
[01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:28.972]  Also, you know, Loose Change 2nd Edition, you actually support the boys, the young men that made this film,
[01:10:29.822 --> 01:10:31.463]  I've heard it sold by other talk shows
[01:10:44.398 --> 01:10:46.699]  For $28, it's $26 in stores.
[01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:50.500]  Big, beautiful, you know, with diagrams and documents.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:51.840]  Hardcover book.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.541]  Very handsome gift for those that still read.
[01:10:55.161 --> 01:10:59.422]  Buy one for yourself, buy one for a friend or neighbor, or buy one and read it and give it away.
[01:10:59.782 --> 01:11:01.382]  But this is a great reference book to have.
[01:11:01.702 --> 01:11:03.063]  That's available for $19.95 at InfoWars.com.
[01:11:03.083 --> 01:11:04.023]  $6 off the retail price.
[01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:11.671]  And by the way, it's sold out a lot of places.
[01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.592]  We have it available for you.
[01:11:14.612 --> 01:11:19.554]  You need to get it today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:20.255 --> 01:11:20.955]  Get your copy.
[01:11:22.523 --> 01:11:23.803]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:24.344 --> 01:11:32.686]  And, uh, get Terror Storm, final edition, special edition, 17 minutes of powerful new footage on the BBC reporting Building 7 had fallen before it fell.
[01:11:32.946 --> 01:11:35.287]  Uh, media scripting caught red-handed.
[01:11:36.147 --> 01:11:41.509]  The legendary, it was just great, historic, thousands of people out protesting at Ground Zero on 9-11.
[01:11:41.849 --> 01:11:43.830]  That's another three or four minutes of the 17 minutes.
[01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:44.590]  I mean, it is just
[01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:47.151]  And we re-edited and remastered the whole film.
[01:11:47.711 --> 01:11:49.232]  17 minutes is entirely brand new.
[01:11:49.632 --> 01:11:53.213]  The rest of it's had new audio added, new video added, mixed better.
[01:11:53.233 --> 01:11:54.914]  It was mixed good before, but we were in a rush.
[01:11:54.934 --> 01:11:58.775]  It's just, it's a totally different film in many ways.
[01:11:59.235 --> 01:12:00.976]  And there were two little mistakes in the film.
[01:12:01.036 --> 01:12:01.896]  We're not perfect.
[01:12:02.236 --> 01:12:04.477]  The last person I heard of that was perfect was Jesus Christ.
[01:12:05.278 --> 01:12:08.539]  And he really wasn't a man, but he was a man at the same time.
[01:12:08.559 --> 01:12:11.700]  The point is that there were two mistakes and the film hasn't been fixed.
[01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:15.212]  And so it is really a powerful film.
[01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:18.214]  It got critiqued by millions, so we did find a few little mistakes.
[01:12:19.175 --> 01:12:22.938]  One was a mistake, one could be interpreted wrong, could be lawyerly.
[01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:28.242]  So the point is, you need the new Terror Storm at Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:12:28.262 --> 01:12:28.302]  888-253-3139.
[01:12:28.342 --> 01:12:28.402]  Now,
[01:12:40.296 --> 01:12:41.837]  Let me go ahead and get into the Colbert Report.
[01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:44.039]  Everything he does is with extreme satire.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:51.764]  And so, whatever he's saying, he means the opposite of what he's saying, and he's admitted to this.
[01:12:52.324 --> 01:13:00.670]  He loves Secret Arrest, he loves FEMA camps, he thinks the war isn't going down like the Titanic, it's going up like the Hindenburg.
[01:13:03.452 --> 01:13:05.434]  And overall, I think this is a positive piece.
[01:13:05.534 --> 01:13:08.736]  I know some of the people that work for Colbert, that have contacted me many times,
[01:13:10.111 --> 01:13:11.292]  Not many, three or four times.
[01:13:11.312 --> 01:13:12.533]  I know people that work for Stewart.
[01:13:14.075 --> 01:13:16.437]  I know that they follow a lot of our work, because I've talked to them.
[01:13:17.358 --> 01:13:18.979]  I've had them also, I never approached them.
[01:13:18.999 --> 01:13:23.403]  A few times, I was approached twice about going on Colbert, and then it got shot down by higher-ups.
[01:13:23.804 --> 01:13:25.385]  And I was approached three times about going.
[01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:27.347]  In fact, once they said, you live in New York, don't you?
[01:13:27.387 --> 01:13:28.788]  Come by today to the Daily Show.
[01:13:28.808 --> 01:13:30.330]  And I said, no, I'm in Texas.
[01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:32.111]  And they said, you can't get on a plane.
[01:13:32.292 --> 01:13:34.213]  No, it's in four hours.
[01:13:34.233 --> 01:13:34.814]  Oh, sorry.
[01:13:36.664 --> 01:13:40.928]  I'm a big fan, and I'm such a producer, but I could sneak you on right now.
[01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:43.510]  I don't want to get off into all the back stuff.
[01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:45.771]  The point is, I know that they're pretty good guys over there.
[01:13:46.892 --> 01:13:50.495]  Even though I've criticized that they make a joke out of serious things, well, what are they supposed to do?
[01:13:50.535 --> 01:13:51.356]  It's a comedy channel.
[01:13:51.796 --> 01:13:53.718]  That's why the elite allows it, though.
[01:13:54.879 --> 01:14:01.624]  And Colbert started talking about the Forbes writer who quit over the fact Benjamin Fulford.
[01:14:01.644 --> 01:14:03.486]  You've all been calling in for weeks asking what I think of it.
[01:14:03.786 --> 01:14:06.228]  I've had time now to listen to most of both the interviews.
[01:14:08.753 --> 01:14:11.694]  And I have to say this, he sounds like he believes what he's saying.
[01:14:13.174 --> 01:14:19.655]  That there's this global secret society of Asians, well we know there's that, based out of really Japan from my intel.
[01:14:19.695 --> 01:14:21.716]  He says China, but we know the two are connected.
[01:14:22.456 --> 01:14:26.497]  And that they're aware of the Illuminati plan to depopulate Asia and that operations have already been ongoing.
[01:14:26.637 --> 01:14:27.797]  Well that's been mainstream news too.
[01:14:28.037 --> 01:14:30.398]  I mean I can confirm all that outside of Benjamin Fulford.
[01:14:31.058 --> 01:14:32.198]  So that adds to credibility.
[01:14:32.822 --> 01:14:36.284]  But the point is, the Chinese leadership and the Japanese leadership review World Order all the way.
[01:14:36.524 --> 01:14:38.085]  They've signed on to UN eugenics.
[01:14:38.105 --> 01:14:39.546]  They've gotten the awards for it.
[01:14:40.166 --> 01:14:44.369]  And so, is there a mid-level society that's infiltrated the higher levels that is against it?
[01:14:44.529 --> 01:14:44.749]  Sure!
[01:14:44.809 --> 01:14:46.270]  There's always camps.
[01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:47.330]  Does this go to the top?
[01:14:48.211 --> 01:14:49.431]  Not from what I've got.
[01:14:49.612 --> 01:14:50.832]  It's just that isn't the action.
[01:14:50.852 --> 01:14:54.554]  That isn't what we've seen from Japan and China.
[01:14:54.875 --> 01:14:57.616]  Japan is some of the biggest pushers of eugenics ever.
[01:14:58.176 --> 01:15:00.878]  I mean, you talk about being, you know, into their group.
[01:15:01.502 --> 01:15:02.203]  Am I knocking that?
[01:15:02.223 --> 01:15:03.864]  You know, be into your tribe, whatever, cool.
[01:15:04.244 --> 01:15:05.645]  That's normal and natural.
[01:15:06.086 --> 01:15:11.390]  But the point is, when it goes to the extreme of eugenics, it's bad.
[01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:12.912]  A lot of what he says checks out.
[01:15:13.432 --> 01:15:15.894]  Is he being set up to try to discredit the whole thing?
[01:15:17.675 --> 01:15:18.396]  I've seen this before.
[01:15:18.456 --> 01:15:19.297]  We're con artists.
[01:15:20.876 --> 01:15:33.040]  We'll approach people and claim, I got 20 million in a bank and I'm the such and such ambassador and just do this but send me money and then we'll be able to get it out and you know I've seen those things before and it fools reporters and folks that get taken for a ride.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:43.664]  I've seen just a lot of cases of stuff like this and you know where people calling up, no it is true, I sent them 5,000 and the Nigerians are about to give me 14 mil.
[01:15:44.024 --> 01:15:48.725]  I talked to them in Nigeria, it's real, no no, I've won the lottery, I'm getting the 14 mil.
[01:15:48.765 --> 01:15:50.466]  You know they won't listen.
[01:15:51.109 --> 01:15:57.916]  So con artists are out there too, and you see a lot of examples of this.
[01:15:58.817 --> 01:16:10.488]  We should cover it, we should look at it, because he is a respected writer from Forbes who did quit over this, he wasn't fired, and he's written expert articles I've read on globalism and the new world order for Forbes that they let him publish.
[01:16:11.972 --> 01:16:14.273]  That's a little suspicious there, too.
[01:16:14.353 --> 01:16:15.934]  So I'm kind of trying to gauge all this.
[01:16:15.974 --> 01:16:16.755]  Frankly, I don't know.
[01:16:17.195 --> 01:16:18.916]  People always want me to say, I know everything.
[01:16:18.996 --> 01:16:19.296]  I don't.
[01:16:19.656 --> 01:16:21.937]  As time comes out, we tend to learn everything.
[01:16:22.418 --> 01:16:23.518]  But that's in hindsight.
[01:16:23.939 --> 01:16:25.099]  Things have to flesh out.
[01:16:25.139 --> 01:16:26.960]  They have to... Let's say this.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.221]  I got alarm bells ringing.
[01:16:29.321 --> 01:16:34.464]  But... There's so many alarms going off, I really can't differentiate.
[01:16:34.784 --> 01:16:36.165]  I think the guy thinks he's credible.
[01:16:36.545 --> 01:16:37.706]  I think he has been approached.
[01:16:37.846 --> 01:16:39.347]  I think... The question is, by who?
[01:16:41.123 --> 01:16:44.785]  But now to have Colbert talking about it is a big deal.
[01:16:44.805 --> 01:16:54.051]  When we get back from break, we're going to play this, because this means it has hit supernova status in the media, when they only talk about iconic things.
[01:16:55.051 --> 01:17:00.354]  And I believe that he rarely does obscure things on his show, that Colbert is trying to give this attention.
[01:17:01.535 --> 01:17:03.196]  Because the elite do want to go.
[01:17:03.256 --> 01:17:08.439]  They've got a green light right now to go, go, go, with global bio-plagues to wipe out certain
[01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:36.794]  derivation certain varieties of homo sapien sapien and if you've got any Native American in you this stuff will attack you as well and I never run around bragging about it and like I'm the holy messiah but you know my my dad's got Native American quite a bit of Native American on both sides of his family it uh... is not visible in me because my mom was a German on both sides uh... Alsatian in German is a French German in German
[01:17:37.735 --> 01:17:39.177]  I don't think so.
[01:17:53.775 --> 01:17:58.797]  I don't want to say the ladies liked him, but I wish I got those looks.
[01:17:58.817 --> 01:18:01.318]  I mean, I got good looks, but not people like that's looks.
[01:18:01.338 --> 01:18:06.620]  The point is, I don't run around that I'm the holier-than-thou, but bio-weapons get released.
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:15.483]  A lot of us that have any Native American, and then this has come out in reports from Israel and South Africa and also the Japanese looking at it.
[01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:23.005]  If you target Arabs, they are a hybrid between Anglo and Asian.
[01:18:23.285 --> 01:18:27.210]  In a lot of areas like Egypt, there's also a lot of Negro mixed in.
[01:18:28.331 --> 01:18:30.233]  Don't email me saying that's a racist term, folks.
[01:18:30.253 --> 01:18:31.394]  That's the scientific name.
[01:18:32.075 --> 01:18:33.376]  Anglo, Negro, Asian.
[01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:42.773]  And so, if they attack the Arabs with it, it's gonna kill a bunch of Asians, and it'll kill what's left of Native Americans and Mexicans.
[01:18:43.073 --> 01:18:44.954]  Latin Americans, you're really Asian.
[01:18:45.294 --> 01:18:47.015]  No one ever told you, but that's what you are.
[01:18:47.655 --> 01:18:48.676]  We'll be right back, stay with us.

[01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:56.629]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:57.009 --> 01:19:59.030]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:20:00.211 --> 01:20:05.034]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:05.234 --> 01:20:07.976]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:08.016 --> 01:20:09.136]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:10.457 --> 01:20:15.040]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:15.976 --> 01:20:23.239]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:24.239 --> 01:20:27.300]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:32.903]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:20:33.903 --> 01:20:35.163]  Call for your copy today.
[01:20:35.403 --> 01:20:37.284]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.685 --> 01:20:44.527]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:20:45.217 --> 01:20:47.659]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:47.739 --> 01:20:51.281]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.362 --> 01:20:55.744]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.765]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:20:58.105 --> 01:21:01.928]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:21:02.368 --> 01:21:04.570]  Haven't you heard about Cal-X ointment?
[01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:08.332]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:21:08.732 --> 01:21:11.134]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:21:11.693 --> 01:21:12.735]  What's that name again?
[01:21:13.136 --> 01:21:14.298]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:21:14.699 --> 01:21:15.861]  It's Calex.
[01:21:16.281 --> 01:21:18.105]  C-A-L-E-X.
[01:21:18.465 --> 01:21:20.309]  What makes Calex Leutmann so different?
[01:21:21.081 --> 01:21:29.703]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:21:30.143 --> 01:21:35.865]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:21:36.245 --> 01:21:47.388]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:21:48.027 --> 01:21:49.148]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[01:21:49.468 --> 01:21:50.148]  I'll be right back.
[01:21:50.268 --> 01:21:52.009]  I'm getting some callots for my heels.
[01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:55.871]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:56.431 --> 01:22:03.015]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[01:22:03.675 --> 01:22:08.918]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[01:22:09.714 --> 01:22:21.449]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that thirst was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.

[01:22:55.941 --> 01:22:58.164]  What would you do if you knew?
[01:22:58.584 --> 01:23:00.407]  Who on earth can bring you?
[01:23:00.447 --> 01:23:02.449]  Won't you stand up?
[01:23:02.509 --> 01:23:03.690]  What should we do?
[01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:06.233]  What would you turn away to?
[01:23:06.534 --> 01:23:08.456]  And what if you saw?
[01:23:08.556 --> 01:23:11.039]  All of the things that's wrong?
[01:23:11.299 --> 01:23:13.602]  Won't you stand tall and strong?
[01:23:19.405 --> 01:23:20.427]  We're good to go.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:47.564]  I see a message from the government like every day I watch it and listen and call them all suckers They're warning me about Osama or whatever picture me buying this scam I said never!
[01:23:47.984 --> 01:24:06.131]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting I say commit it, give it up, if I lose commission It's all a part of fighting devil's state mind control And all about the battle for your body, mind and soul And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape ya Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us slaves and rapists Another push season mean another war for profit
[01:24:06.351 --> 01:24:06.871]  Welcome back.
[01:24:06.891 --> 01:24:09.894]  Just like Ferris told you, don't forget they gave us AIDS and raped us.
[01:24:09.954 --> 01:24:14.197]  That goes for all the black cops and FBI agents that sit there and serve this new world order.
[01:24:14.217 --> 01:24:15.999]  Those are the white cops too, they're targeting you.
[01:24:33.633 --> 01:24:37.894]  I can't imagine how you can be black and just totally believe this government and go along with it.
[01:24:37.914 --> 01:24:39.854]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:24:40.714 --> 01:24:42.535]  So this report is up on JonesReport.com.
[01:24:42.575 --> 01:24:45.535]  Colbert hopes to join Illuminati's Worldly Population Plan.
[01:24:45.575 --> 01:24:51.837]  References warning by former Forbes writer Benjamin Fulford, the whole genocide by race-specific bioweapons.
[01:24:52.237 --> 01:24:56.538]  And then he makes jokes about it, but then we go through South Africa deployed race-specific bioweapons.
[01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:57.598]  We link to that.
[01:24:58.378 --> 01:24:59.378]  Then Israel got them.
[01:24:59.438 --> 01:25:02.419]  Dick Cheney mentions the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[01:25:03.039 --> 01:25:07.161]  In the Project for an American Century, page 60 document, we put a link to that.
[01:25:07.641 --> 01:25:12.384]  Henry Kissinger endorsed the planks of the 1944 Royal Commission on Population, link to that.
[01:25:12.664 --> 01:25:19.587]  Then a link to the 1974 National Security Memorandum 200.
[01:25:19.968 --> 01:25:23.870]  Then we have links to Ted Turner, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Prince Philip, Bertrand Russell.
[01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:24.930]  We have links to all of it.
[01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:29.552]  So what happens is folks go read this because it's about Colbert, and they find out, hey, this isn't a joke.
[01:25:29.973 --> 01:25:32.434]  See, we take his joke, which is meant to get you to look,
[01:25:33.343 --> 01:25:34.804]  And then you get to go see the facts.
[01:25:34.844 --> 01:25:35.665]  Go ahead and play Colbert.
[01:25:35.685 --> 01:25:37.466]  This is Colbert from a couple nights ago.
[01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:52.296]  Benjamin Fulford, who quit his job at Forbes after they refused to run a piece, he wrote, Now Fulford is accusing the Illuminati, the secret society that controls the world, of planning to depopulate the Earth.
[01:25:52.316 --> 01:25:59.521]  Now normally I would ignore this kind of raving from an obscure hack, but there is one reason I want to talk about it.
[01:26:00.211 --> 01:26:04.454]  The possibility that the Illuminati might let me join.
[01:26:06.035 --> 01:26:08.277]  Masters of the Temple, please let me in!
[01:26:09.177 --> 01:26:13.220]  I tried every crazy handshake I can think of when I met President Bush.
[01:26:14.421 --> 01:26:17.183]  You would not believe what I'm doing with my fingers here.
[01:26:18.864 --> 01:26:21.766]  And I've got some great ideas about depopulating the Earth.
[01:26:22.509 --> 01:26:26.891]  There has never been a better time to put me in charge of the destiny of mankind.
[01:26:27.571 --> 01:26:40.315]  I will await your answer every night for the next month in the exact center of the Brooklyn Bridge, whose tables, by the way, are in the same geometric ratio as the size of the Pyramid of Giza.
[01:26:42.356 --> 01:26:44.176]  I see patterns where none exist.
[01:26:46.177 --> 01:26:48.918]  Until then... Is this it?
[01:26:50.398 --> 01:26:51.779]  En vige Blumenkraft!
[01:26:55.723 --> 01:26:56.904]  So there you have it.
[01:27:00.327 --> 01:27:08.613]  And of course you didn't know that the guy that built the Brooklyn Bridge was a big mason, a big globalist, and actually did have a lot of designs that went into it.
[01:27:08.633 --> 01:27:11.456]  So see there's the big, another big joke about it.
[01:27:12.597 --> 01:27:14.718]  We had that big professor on from Canada a few years ago.
[01:27:14.758 --> 01:27:24.046]  Now his book is out about all the occultic stuff, how Aleister Crowley's designs were used after the turn of the last century to build the new parliament in Canada.
[01:27:24.813 --> 01:27:25.554]  I've been to it, man.
[01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:29.276]  The whole thing's got devils and demons and pentagrams all over it.
[01:27:29.316 --> 01:27:29.897]  We've seen that.
[01:27:29.937 --> 01:27:37.682]  I've put it out on the web on PrisonPlanet.tv and our occult piece we put out on occult symbolism and architecture.
[01:27:38.142 --> 01:27:39.203]  We show it in Austin.
[01:27:39.603 --> 01:27:40.544]  We show it in England.
[01:27:40.924 --> 01:27:41.965]  We show it in D.C.
[01:27:42.005 --> 01:27:42.885]  We show it in Canada.
[01:27:42.905 --> 01:27:46.888]  The kind of stuff we post for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.902]  By the way, get your PrisonPlanet.tv membership, folks.
[01:27:50.302 --> 01:27:50.742]  Use it!
[01:27:51.123 --> 01:27:52.644]  Burn those reports on the disc.
[01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:55.566]  They're getting higher and higher res, and they just look great.
[01:27:56.166 --> 01:28:01.811]  You ought to see the flash formats, super high res, medium res, we put up for you to download and burn the disc.
[01:28:02.711 --> 01:28:05.073]  It's even easier with the windows and the real player.

[01:28:12.289 --> 01:28:13.529]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:17.971]  I'm just plugging that because it is such a point of resistance.
[01:28:18.071 --> 01:28:19.332]  It is an armory.
[01:28:19.952 --> 01:28:22.294]  It is a command base of the InfoWar.

[01:28:28.737 --> 01:28:31.578]  Don't forget, big report on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:28:32.058 --> 01:28:33.159]  Pat Tillman murdered.
[01:28:33.889 --> 01:28:39.052]  The facts are in, and you know who he was murdered by in the words of Keith Overman and Wesley Clark.
[01:28:39.533 --> 01:28:41.134]  This stuff goes all the way to the top.
[01:28:43.575 --> 01:28:44.476]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.976 --> 01:28:46.597]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.518 --> 01:28:50.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:47.122]  Do it today!
[01:29:54.030 --> 01:30:00.834]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[01:30:01.194 --> 01:30:07.597]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[01:30:08.078 --> 01:30:17.983]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[01:30:18.463 --> 01:30:21.925]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[01:30:22.225 --> 01:30:24.906]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[01:30:25.527 --> 01:30:28.228]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[01:30:28.788 --> 01:30:30.709]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[01:30:30.729 --> 01:30:31.449]  Box 969 Soquel, S-O-Q-U-E-L, California, 95073.
[01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:34.311]  $32 to Radio Liberty Box 969 Soquel, California, 95073.
[01:30:34.691 --> 01:30:35.491]  Or call 1-800-544-8927.
[01:30:35.511 --> 01:30:35.571]  1-800-544-8927.
[01:30:52.799 --> 01:30:56.903]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[01:30:57.163 --> 01:31:02.248]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[01:31:02.529 --> 01:31:07.173]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[01:31:07.534 --> 01:31:09.496]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[01:31:09.796 --> 01:31:15.662]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:31:16.002 --> 01:31:16.783]  And it works.
[01:31:17.223 --> 01:31:18.663]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[01:31:19.043 --> 01:31:20.064]  Now it's your turn.
[01:31:20.324 --> 01:31:22.684]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[01:31:22.824 --> 01:31:27.105]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[01:31:27.405 --> 01:31:30.506]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[01:31:30.886 --> 01:31:33.086]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[01:31:33.266 --> 01:31:35.627]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[01:31:35.687 --> 01:31:35.887]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:37.787]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:31:45.129 --> 01:31:45.750]  Guaranteed.
[01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:46.271]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:46.551]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:20.951]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:32:20.971 --> 01:32:22.592]  until 2 p.m.
[01:32:23.312 --> 01:32:24.772]  Central Standard Time.
[01:32:24.792 --> 01:32:27.473]  We're here live, folks.
[01:32:27.533 --> 01:32:28.774]  This is the real deal.
[01:32:28.814 --> 01:32:30.534]  This is the real Fight Club.
[01:32:32.695 --> 01:32:38.637]  This is a fight for humanity, a fight for sovereignty, a fight against the globalists and the internationalists.
[01:32:39.937 --> 01:32:41.358]  A fight until the end.
[01:32:41.918 --> 01:32:42.838]  Mortal Kombat.
[01:32:44.628 --> 01:32:49.013]  Well, I tell you folks, it is on the New York Times Best Seller list and rising towards number one.
[01:32:49.033 --> 01:32:53.239]  It is the Late Great USA, the coming merger with Mexico and Canada.
[01:32:53.659 --> 01:32:57.804]  We've got it here, ladies and gentlemen, for you, discounted for $19.95.
[01:32:58.405 --> 01:32:59.466]  And I want you to buy 3, 4, 5, 10 copies.
[01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:18.110]  Because then you will have a treatise with the documents in a hardcover, beautifully bound, well-written book by Dr. Jerome, courtesy PhD, that you can say, hey, you listen to all these neocons, Limbaugh saying it doesn't exist, all these people, you go ahead and you take this,
[01:33:19.557 --> 01:33:23.179]  By the way, this is put out by Joseph Farah, the guy that really wrote Limbaugh's books.
[01:33:23.219 --> 01:33:23.980]  He's the ghostwriter.
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:24.980]  It says that in the book.
[01:33:25.021 --> 01:33:30.864]  So, oh, here's Limbaugh's writer's publisher with Jerome Corsi, a real conservative.
[01:33:31.044 --> 01:33:33.446]  This is the guy that went after Kerry and shot him down.
[01:33:33.926 --> 01:33:35.447]  Oh, here, here he is saying they're traitors.
[01:33:35.487 --> 01:33:38.049]  Here, here, you take this from Dr. Corsi.
[01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:46.114]  Because there is, I have Fox News again yesterday saying, there's no such thing as a North American Union, but it's a good idea.
[01:33:46.784 --> 01:33:49.626]  And see, that's what the liberals and conservatives and the establishment do.
[01:33:49.646 --> 01:33:58.072]  So I just hope you get this book at InfoWars.com, ladies and gentlemen, or in bookstores around the country if you so wish, but you get a discount on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:59.386 --> 01:34:01.627]  Dr. Corsi, thank you for joining us again.
[01:34:01.647 --> 01:34:07.470]  I know I'm having you on every week right now because so much is happening with the SPP, both against and for.
[01:34:07.911 --> 01:34:16.755]  You have helped with the listeners of this show and many others across America, but you're really at the center of this, taking the leadership position and stepping up to the plate here, and that's what we need.
[01:34:17.396 --> 01:34:20.337]  We've got legislation in Congress that's starting to block some of this.
[01:34:20.677 --> 01:34:23.019]  They're not listening to the hoax that it doesn't exist.
[01:34:24.419 --> 01:34:27.121]  So much is happening, so we are just really honored to have you.
[01:34:27.918 --> 01:34:31.025]  Well, Alex, it's a great honor for me to be on your show, so thank you.
[01:34:31.887 --> 01:34:35.295]  You're fighting the fight, and I'm thrilled to be with you.
[01:34:36.258 --> 01:34:37.719]  What are the neocons doing?
[01:34:37.779 --> 01:34:46.465]  It seems like they're now starting to panic that mainline, traditional, respected conservatives like yourself actually have researched them and are now exposing them.
[01:34:47.125 --> 01:34:49.067]  I don't think they can stand much longer.
[01:34:49.087 --> 01:34:57.132]  I mean, it's one thing to have some mindless liberal attacking them on mindless non-issues, but to be attacked by real conservatives, what are they going to do?
[01:34:57.152 --> 01:35:03.496]  Well, I think it's putting a great deal of stress on the administration and on the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:35:04.877 --> 01:35:19.350]  I'm finding with the level of documentation that's in this book, and I think one of the reasons it is rising in the charts, is that when people see it's a 235 page book, I wrote it to be easy to read, but 30 pages of it fully are footnotes.
[01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:27.297]  And you can see, you can go look at the footnotes yourself, they are all right there, mostly government documents.
[01:35:28.258 --> 01:35:32.221]  I wanted people to be able to, with their own eyes, see the evidence.
[01:35:32.805 --> 01:35:37.867]  It's just like the articles I've been writing in WorldNetDaily and Human Events Online especially.
[01:35:37.907 --> 01:35:42.650]  I've gone back to being a staff writer at WorldNetDaily and we've archived all my articles.
[01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:44.590]  So, Alex, they're free up there.
[01:35:44.610 --> 01:35:46.491]  The book has them in one place.
[01:35:47.332 --> 01:35:49.033]  You can click on the links in the articles.
[01:35:49.093 --> 01:35:51.514]  I'm continuing to write articles almost every day now.
[01:35:52.374 --> 01:35:55.676]  And I'm planning to go up to Canada on August 20th and 21st
[01:35:57.471 --> 01:35:58.552]  To be in Ottawa.
[01:35:58.612 --> 01:36:00.593]  And you're going to be reporting for us there?
[01:36:00.633 --> 01:36:02.855]  Yes, I'm going to recall on your show every day I'm up there.
[01:36:03.595 --> 01:36:09.159]  And I'm even going to try to get into Austin and be with you in studio before that.
[01:36:09.619 --> 01:36:11.260]  Absolutely, please come down, yes.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.482]  Because I have to be in Texas.
[01:36:13.542 --> 01:36:14.682]  I've got to arrange that trip.
[01:36:15.183 --> 01:36:21.227]  But I'd love to be in studio with you and actually sit down and talk through some of these issues before I go up to Ottawa.
[01:36:21.687 --> 01:36:22.968]  Because this is going to be a huge meeting.
[01:36:23.008 --> 01:36:26.490]  This is the third summit meeting of the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:36:27.505 --> 01:36:38.827]  And they've declared a 25 kilometer security perimeter around Montebello, Quebec, near Ottawa, where the meeting is going to be held.
[01:36:39.767 --> 01:36:45.928]  And the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are going to be actively involved, the Sureté, the Quebec, the state police.
[01:36:46.828 --> 01:36:49.469]  And I've been getting research reports from people saying the U.S.
[01:36:49.569 --> 01:36:53.169]  Army is going to be out there, and I'm going to look for that to see if I can document it.
[01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.810]  Dr. Corsi,
[01:36:58.107 --> 01:37:01.348]  It's not that they're just having a secret meeting that's now been exposed.
[01:37:01.768 --> 01:37:03.329]  It's not just the security perimeter.
[01:37:04.749 --> 01:37:13.492]  It's all of that combined, that here they are engaging in treason, while denying they're doing it, when we have the foyer documents that you and others helped get at Judicial Watch.
[01:37:14.252 --> 01:37:18.493]  When you add it all together, it is a perfect picture of rogue government.
[01:37:19.153 --> 01:37:19.673]  Well, it is.
[01:37:19.753 --> 01:37:25.255]  I mean, Alex, look, I've published on page 81 of the book, I've got the organizational chart of these working groups.
[01:37:25.993 --> 01:37:32.316]  And you can see them described on SPP, Security and Prosperity Partnership, you know, sampeterpaul.gov.
[01:37:32.916 --> 01:37:35.817]  It's a .gov, it's a Department of Commerce website.
[01:37:36.558 --> 01:37:49.223]  And the little boxes, you know, the North American Transportation Working Group, the North American Energy Working Group, the North American Environment Working Group, they report to cabinet-level officers.
[01:37:49.921 --> 01:37:52.542]  In the U.S., they come up to Secretary of State Rice.
[01:37:52.602 --> 01:37:53.482]  She's at the center.
[01:37:53.642 --> 01:38:01.443]  Well, I want to go over that makeup of the power structure and how they're already merging the bureaucracies, but let's get into the latest articles you've done here.
[01:38:01.483 --> 01:38:04.564]  Can you break that down for people, because you're right on top of this issue.
[01:38:04.864 --> 01:38:09.425]  We now see Congress moving to try to pass laws blocking NAFTA highways.
[01:38:09.805 --> 01:38:13.146]  We see talk of blocking any SPP funding.
[01:38:13.686 --> 01:38:15.286]  Can you tell us about those developments?
[01:38:15.606 --> 01:38:23.610]  Yes, this was the, just yesterday I reported, in fact I think it's still the top article, one of the top articles in World Net Daily.
[01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:43.620]  There are motions now being submitted, Duncan Hunter submitted a motion yesterday to the transportation bill that would effectively block the expenditure of any money that would effectively let the working groups engage in NAFTA superhighway work.
[01:38:44.261 --> 01:38:56.847]  It was one of the first times I'd ever seen a memo, really an amendment, submitted and structured to the Transportation Appropriations Bill, H.R.
[01:38:56.867 --> 01:38:58.267]  3074, Duncan Hunter.
[01:38:58.827 --> 01:39:03.009]  And the language that Hunter used in proposing this amendment, it passed.
[01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:04.930]  It passed 362 to 63.
[01:39:05.490 --> 01:39:10.553]  Then the House approved the Transportation Act, which is H.R. 3074.
[01:39:14.181 --> 01:39:16.541]  The Hunter's Amendment passed 362 to 63.
[01:39:16.601 --> 01:39:17.522]  Wow!
[01:39:18.502 --> 01:39:21.122]  And the Appropriations Bill passed 268 to 153.
[01:39:21.162 --> 01:39:24.703]  Now, you've read the legislation.
[01:39:24.783 --> 01:39:25.843]  Is this a major victory?
[01:39:26.123 --> 01:39:30.944]  It's a major victory because if this goes through the Senate, and the Senate's going to have to keep this in.
[01:39:31.044 --> 01:39:37.105]  I'm sure there'll be an attempt to strike it out, but then they could be fought over in conference.
[01:39:37.245 --> 01:39:39.806]  It's the first time that anyone
[01:39:40.256 --> 01:39:43.657]  You know, and Congressman Hunter is running for President of the Republican side.
[01:39:43.697 --> 01:39:52.460]  This, again, has to tremendously upset the Republican National Committee to get this level of determination to fight the NAFTA superhighway.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:54.260]  Now that's certainly a feather in his cap.
[01:39:54.641 --> 01:40:01.263]  It sure is, and you know, especially when you still have Tony Snow and Fox News and everybody else denying that these things exist.
[01:40:02.903 --> 01:40:08.825]  I think that the Hunter amendment is going to... and at the same time, Hunter also joined
[01:40:09.457 --> 01:40:22.662]  With Ted Poe, a congressman from Texas, and Tom Tancredo from Colorado, they put an amendment into the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act, another appropriations bill, going through the House.
[01:40:22.722 --> 01:40:32.886]  And this one would block the Bureau of Prisons from spending any more money to imprison Ramos and Campion, the two Border Patrol agents that are serving 11- and 12-year prison sentences.
[01:40:32.986 --> 01:40:34.347]  And being murderly attacked.
[01:40:35.137 --> 01:40:35.898]  Brutally attacked.
[01:40:35.938 --> 01:40:37.359]  Ramos has been brutally beaten up.
[01:40:37.399 --> 01:40:40.160]  Kept for now seven months in solitary confinement.
[01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:47.365]  And what they did was shoot after a drug smuggler who was smuggling more than 750 pounds across the border with Mexico.
[01:40:47.525 --> 01:40:51.248]  And who had already physically been in a fight with him and what it looked like was pulling a gun.
[01:40:51.768 --> 01:40:52.549]  Yes, exactly.
[01:40:52.569 --> 01:41:04.237]  And, you know, I've also been able now, we've gotten, and I wrote about it as well, that there is Congressman Rohrabacher's office released and there's going to be hearings on Tuesday
[01:41:04.815 --> 01:41:16.939]  I'm going to be in Washington for Congressman Rohrabacher's hearings on Robinson Compion, because it's clear now that Davila, the drug smuggler, had been given border pass cards.
[01:41:16.979 --> 01:41:27.703]  He'd been given a total of six of them, including border pass cards for like five or six months after he brought a second load of drugs into the United States while on immunity.
[01:41:28.203 --> 01:41:30.344]  They kept issuing him border pass cards.
[01:41:31.004 --> 01:41:33.685]  He had one for nearly a month after the trial ended.
[01:41:34.574 --> 01:41:38.015]  You know, these kinds of favors to a drug smuggler to get his testimony.
[01:41:38.035 --> 01:41:47.879]  Well, that's one of the scariest things about these confidential federal informants, and now they're going to hire, it's not 1,500, it's 10,000 domestic spies to fight terror and crime.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.061]  Can you imagine Stasi that we're now going to have domestically, and it'll be people like this?
[01:41:52.361 --> 01:41:58.344]  And literally, once you're a Stasi, folks, you're always above the law because you're an informant, so they protect you.
[01:41:59.144 --> 01:42:04.106]  Just digressing into that for a moment, did you see ABC News yesterday announcing they're going to have domestic Stasi?
[01:42:04.606 --> 01:42:05.547]  No, I didn't see that.
[01:42:05.567 --> 01:42:08.509]  I'll have to go hunt that up on the internet.
[01:42:09.209 --> 01:42:11.691]  But you know, this is coming so fast and furious.
[01:42:12.171 --> 01:42:17.555]  I also got a hold of another Freedom of Information Act request in Canada.
[01:42:18.716 --> 01:42:21.738]  Another document that had been kept secret by the three governments.
[01:42:22.258 --> 01:42:29.883]  It was a summary of this February 23rd meeting where Secretary of State Rice met with her counterparts, the Canadian
[01:42:30.413 --> 01:42:34.974]  Foreign Minister Peter McKay and Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
[01:42:35.194 --> 01:42:42.617]  They had a secret meeting and then they had a public news conference, but even in the news conference she said, we are one country, we are one group.
[01:42:42.637 --> 01:42:43.677]  She couldn't keep her mouth shut.
[01:42:44.057 --> 01:42:59.462]  Exactly, and what this shows is, what this government document unearthed in Canada shows is that this North American Competitiveness Council, which is an official group put together by the Department of Commerce under the Security and Prosperity Partnership,
[01:43:00.526 --> 01:43:08.711]  ...is basically ruling the agenda for the upcoming SPP Third Summit in Ottawa, scheduled for August 20th and 21st.
[01:43:09.371 --> 01:43:11.912]  And what that means is, they're setting a business agenda.
[01:43:11.952 --> 01:43:19.516]  The multinational corporations, ten from each of the three countries that are on this council, are saying, here's what we want done.
[01:43:19.556 --> 01:43:26.020]  They're giving orders to the government, basically, to create a North American market now,
[01:43:26.912 --> 01:43:34.155]  With the rules and regulations set in place... You know, Mussolini said that fascism would grow into corporatism, and that's what this is.
[01:43:34.196 --> 01:43:35.876]  This is even worse than fascism.
[01:43:36.357 --> 01:43:41.619]  Actual monopoly capitalism, controlled through a fascist apparatchik.
[01:43:41.939 --> 01:43:46.201]  Yes, and these businesses act to the government to say, look, we're profitable.
[01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:47.602]  You governments are all broke.
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:52.803]  So we're going to set the agenda and you, the government, are going to make the rules what we want them to be.
[01:43:53.343 --> 01:43:58.986]  That's what this North American... But they use government to force hand over the roads so they can put taxes on it.
[01:43:59.006 --> 01:43:59.887]  They're not free market.
[01:44:00.127 --> 01:44:15.376]  They're not free market at all, Alex, because they don't, you know, today I'm watching Secretary Paulson and Gutierrez in this little kind of private meeting with CNBC trying to calm market fears.
[01:44:15.936 --> 01:44:17.417]  It's clear again that Paulson
[01:44:17.898 --> 01:44:23.081]  China is happy to set the scale in an uneven fashion with China benefiting.
[01:44:23.901 --> 01:44:25.722]  This is not free trade.
[01:44:26.663 --> 01:44:31.165]  China is happy to use these NAFTA superhighways to bring its containers into the United States.
[01:44:31.185 --> 01:44:33.406]  That's my question for you.
[01:44:34.387 --> 01:44:41.190]  The economy is literally like sitting on a pile of dynamite with a torch in your hand with sparks dripping down.
[01:44:42.951 --> 01:44:46.614]  The housing market's down 22% now in the last six months.
[01:44:47.294 --> 01:44:49.175]  Half of that dropped just in the month of June.
[01:44:49.195 --> 01:44:51.156]  They're always a month behind on these numbers.
[01:44:51.897 --> 01:44:58.201]  They're saying the month of July, when it comes out, it may be another 5% drop.
[01:44:58.661 --> 01:44:59.942]  As markets go, folks, that is
[01:45:00.598 --> 01:45:01.940]  We're good to go!
[01:45:13.613 --> 01:45:21.475]  And it looks like the Federal Reserve is going to cut back on money printing now, and if they kept printing, it would devalue things, but at least it would go on for a while.
[01:45:21.716 --> 01:45:24.016]  It looks like now they're starting to get ready to put the brakes on.
[01:45:24.316 --> 01:45:28.518]  Dr. Corsi, you know, you study international politics, that's what your degree is in.
[01:45:28.538 --> 01:45:30.498]  I mean, what do you see happening here?
[01:45:30.838 --> 01:45:42.402]  Well, I just have an article today on World News Daily about the market plunge, the 311 points yesterday, and I've been predicting for a year that the stock market bubble is going to burst.
[01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:50.394]  I've even gotten, I published a Carlyle Group letter that I got a hold of, a January 31st Carlyle Group.
[01:45:50.874 --> 01:45:57.358]  And of course they're the defense department, very secretive group that invests to the advantage of the Bush family.
[01:45:57.378 --> 01:45:58.859]  It's a good ol' boy network, yeah.
[01:45:58.899 --> 01:46:07.044]  It's a good ol' boy network, and I reported on this letter, because what this letter says is that basically the cheap debt worldwide
[01:46:07.623 --> 01:46:08.623]  It's going to collapse.
[01:46:08.663 --> 01:46:10.044]  It's not just real estate.
[01:46:10.104 --> 01:46:15.005]  It's all this collateralized debt obligation structures and derivatives.
[01:46:15.085 --> 01:46:16.385]  And it's not just the arms.
[01:46:16.465 --> 01:46:18.586]  It's not just the adjustable rate mortgages now.
[01:46:18.646 --> 01:46:20.086]  It's mainline mortgages.
[01:46:20.486 --> 01:46:22.347]  And it's also beyond mortgages.
[01:46:22.427 --> 01:46:24.027]  It's the entire debt structure.
[01:46:24.527 --> 01:46:28.268]  Half of the volume on Wall Street today is done by hedge funds.
[01:46:28.728 --> 01:46:31.769]  The hedge funds get a little bit of assets and they leverage them.
[01:46:31.809 --> 01:46:33.749]  They borrow up to 50 to 1.
[01:46:34.690 --> 01:46:36.350]  So they're using credit money.
[01:46:37.397 --> 01:46:39.257]  Borrowed money to make their bed.
[01:46:39.277 --> 01:46:44.659]  And we have a higher debt ratio than we had in the depth of the depression in the previous record, November of 1933.
[01:46:45.359 --> 01:46:53.020]  How bad do you think it's going to be, or will it be, what the CFR and others have called for publicly, a slow decline of the United States?
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:59.102]  I've been telling people to get out of the stock market as fast as they can, because the bubble's going to burst.
[01:46:59.642 --> 01:47:05.323]  Buried on page C5 of the Wall Street Journal today, you have to dig to find it.
[01:47:05.782 --> 01:47:12.387]  There are these two Bear Stearns hedge funds that have been dealing with collateralized mortgage obligations.
[01:47:13.048 --> 01:47:16.210]  Bear Stearns just took over the assets of one of them.
[01:47:16.810 --> 01:47:19.713]  It's virtually worthless.
[01:47:20.253 --> 01:47:26.558]  It doesn't have the collateral to pay a $1.6 billion line of credit that Bear Stearns gave to it to keep it afloat.
[01:47:27.376 --> 01:47:28.677]  There's two of these funds.
[01:47:28.857 --> 01:47:30.798]  They're both worthless right now.
[01:47:30.978 --> 01:47:33.019]  And the problem is they start chain reactions.
[01:47:33.299 --> 01:47:36.361]  Because if the government bails it out, that shows there's an underlying crisis.
[01:47:36.961 --> 01:47:38.162]  Then confidence is lost.
[01:47:38.462 --> 01:47:40.403]  And the government won't bail this out.
[01:47:40.423 --> 01:47:43.905]  You're going to see the massive failure of hedge funds.
[01:47:43.985 --> 01:47:50.469]  Because what happens is, when the market goes down, or when interest rates rise, and worldwide interest rates are increasing,
[01:47:51.209 --> 01:47:54.630]  These hedge funds, who are so heavily leveraged, get like margin calls.
[01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:56.351]  They have to put up more capital.
[01:47:56.391 --> 01:47:58.611]  And if you're 500 to 1, there's nothing you can do.
[01:47:58.651 --> 01:47:59.732]  There's nothing they can do.
[01:47:59.772 --> 01:48:00.572]  And so they don't have it.
[01:48:00.672 --> 01:48:04.653]  So eventually, like these two Bear Stearns funds, they go belly up.
[01:48:05.273 --> 01:48:10.415]  Funds that are billions and billions of dollars, supposedly, in value are worthless.
[01:48:10.795 --> 01:48:11.215]  Exactly.
[01:48:11.255 --> 01:48:12.555]  Put it in layman's terms.
[01:48:12.575 --> 01:48:18.037]  I'm not pooh-poohing the audience's intelligence, but we literally have hundreds of thousands of new listeners every few days.
[01:48:18.417 --> 01:48:22.238]  They're tuned in, and they don't know the difference between a Shiite and a Sunni.
[01:48:22.558 --> 01:48:23.158]  They don't know.
[01:48:23.178 --> 01:48:26.199]  I mean, they believe Fox News and everything's fine and CNN.
[01:48:26.479 --> 01:48:29.580]  I mean, they believe that, you know, they've heard Dr. Corsi's evil.
[01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:37.321]  They heard, I mean, the government came out today and said the economy's growing the fastest ever, literally putting perfume not on a pig, but on a latrine.
[01:48:37.341 --> 01:48:39.242]  I mean, put it in layman's terms.
[01:48:39.522 --> 01:48:49.753]  Well, in layman's terms, what's happening is that, you know, a few of these multinational corporations are benefiting because they're getting their earnings over in China.
[01:48:50.173 --> 01:48:54.798]  And they don't mind stacking the deck against the United States because they're multinational.
[01:48:55.399 --> 01:48:56.760]  They get their earnings in China.
[01:48:57.301 --> 01:49:01.805]  Then the whole stock market has been buoyed up by cheap credit.
[01:49:02.694 --> 01:49:04.497]  You know, just like the housing market.
[01:49:04.597 --> 01:49:06.900]  Leveraging, leveraging mortgages.
[01:49:07.601 --> 01:49:14.831]  Leveraging mortgages, like subprime, people who are not really qualified got mortgages that when rates went up they were going to lose.
[01:49:15.853 --> 01:49:19.638]  The same here, investment firms in Wall Street.
[01:49:20.214 --> 01:49:21.977]  Half of the volume by hedge funds.
[01:49:22.037 --> 01:49:25.482]  And a hedge fund is strictly an artificial investment group.
[01:49:25.963 --> 01:49:28.927]  It has no equity, no value, except for the investments it makes.
[01:49:29.488 --> 01:49:30.369]  Highly leveraged.
[01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:34.856]  When that house of debt collapses, the stock market implodes.
[01:49:35.016 --> 01:49:35.918]  And that's what's happening.
[01:49:36.558 --> 01:49:44.145]  And the globalists that are pre-positioned in Europe and China and the Arabs and everybody else get to come in at an even bigger fire sale.
[01:49:44.625 --> 01:49:45.325]  Stay there, Dr. Corsi.
[01:49:45.345 --> 01:49:47.747]  We'll get back into how this will affect the North American Union.
[01:49:48.128 --> 01:49:49.789]  And we're going to take calls for the next 30 minutes.
[01:49:50.109 --> 01:49:50.570]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.602 --> 01:50:02.088]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.449 --> 01:50:10.077]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.771 --> 01:50:17.833]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.234 --> 01:50:29.657]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.977 --> 01:50:33.899]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.919 --> 01:50:35.899]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:40.041]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.334 --> 01:50:58.418]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.478 --> 01:51:05.804]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.944 --> 01:51:16.613]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.773 --> 01:51:21.337]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.597 --> 01:51:26.579]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.799 --> 01:51:29.740]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:39.764]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:52:53.217 --> 01:53:06.701]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[01:53:06.882 --> 01:53:16.825]  Another flashing chance at bliss.
[01:53:17.125 --> 01:53:19.066]  Another kiss.
[01:53:21.801 --> 01:53:25.042]  The days are bright and filled with pain.
[01:53:25.162 --> 01:53:28.243]  Enclose me in your gentle rain.
[01:53:28.283 --> 01:53:32.765]  The days are bright and filled with pain.
[01:53:32.785 --> 01:53:36.586]  Enclose me in your gentle rain.
[01:53:46.314 --> 01:53:51.475]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the torture of me singing along.
[01:53:53.495 --> 01:53:54.896]  I'm about to go back to Dr. Corsi.
[01:53:56.216 --> 01:54:05.498]  Listen, if we can show people who's behind this and how the globalists are engineering this, they will probably try to bail it out or put the brakes on it.
[01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:08.078]  Right now, though, and Dr. Corsi, as usual, is right on target.
[01:54:08.458 --> 01:54:09.119]  I wish he wasn't.
[01:54:09.139 --> 01:54:09.779]  I wish we weren't.
[01:54:10.359 --> 01:54:11.199]  I mean, I've done the study.
[01:54:11.219 --> 01:54:12.839]  I've interviewed Nobel Prize winners on this.
[01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:14.020]  Joseph Stiglitz last year.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:14.640]  No, it was this year.
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.040]  I've interviewed him twice now.
[01:54:16.852 --> 01:54:17.573]  Three times, actually.
[01:54:17.633 --> 01:54:18.193]  Once in person.
[01:54:18.954 --> 01:54:24.739]  But the point is, they are engineering a collapse by design to consolidate.
[01:54:24.759 --> 01:54:26.240]  We'll get Dr. Corsi's take on that.
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:29.203]  I mean, when I say he is correct, I haven't asked that question yet.
[01:54:29.243 --> 01:54:33.486]  He's correct about, from my research, that they're letting it implode.
[01:54:33.546 --> 01:54:35.048]  Well, letting it is doing it.
[01:54:35.348 --> 01:54:36.749]  Because they could stop this, folks.
[01:54:36.789 --> 01:54:37.650]  It's all confidence.
[01:54:38.477 --> 01:54:45.762]  And it's just, I'm very upset because I'm not in the stock market, but everybody I know is, and we're all connected to this.
[01:54:46.262 --> 01:54:51.085]  If you don't think the economy going belly up in the stock market is not going to affect you, you've got another thing coming, folks.
[01:54:51.105 --> 01:54:52.306]  This is going to hurt all of us.
[01:54:53.007 --> 01:54:54.047]  And I'm really upset about it.
[01:54:54.067 --> 01:54:56.489]  I mean, me and my wife are talking about it constantly.
[01:54:56.549 --> 01:54:58.530]  I'm stomping around angry about it.
[01:54:58.610 --> 01:55:02.593]  I just, they've taken this country and just basically destroyed it.
[01:55:02.613 --> 01:55:07.056]  I'm going to tell you about a sponsor, then we'll go back to Dr. Corsi and then start the next hour and take your calls.
[01:55:07.799 --> 01:55:09.040]  We've got a great sponsor.
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:09.961]  It's Research Herbs.
[01:55:10.081 --> 01:55:14.105]  Hundreds of well-documented mainline herbs for nutritive and health effects.
[01:55:15.146 --> 01:55:20.770]  One of them is LIV52 and it is the world's best-selling liver support detox formula.
[01:55:21.071 --> 01:55:30.559]  It was introduced in 1955 and since then has been sold worldwide and is recognized by hundreds of thousands of health professionals as one of the most effective liver formulas in the world.
[01:55:30.599 --> 01:55:32.080]  They have the original LIV52.
[01:55:33.121 --> 01:55:33.782]  We're good to go!
[01:55:53.136 --> 01:55:56.277]  Going back to Dr. Corsi and a few minutes we've got left before this hour ends.
[01:55:57.198 --> 01:56:07.061]  Dr. Corsi, my statements and Joseph Tickle's statements and others about the global elite really engineering this as a consolidating, and he didn't just say it, he released the documents in 2002 where they plot this.
[01:56:09.528 --> 01:56:12.929]  But then I'm seeing mixed signals where the White House is trying to sure this up.
[01:56:13.289 --> 01:56:15.590]  Is the global elite hanging Bush out to dry?
[01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:20.471]  I now see them basically, and I don't like Bush, let's get this clear, but they're piling everything on him.
[01:56:20.931 --> 01:56:24.932]  Even the BBC is reporting now on his Nazi ties, which we've talked about for years.
[01:56:25.253 --> 01:56:27.173]  It seems like now it's open season.
[01:56:27.553 --> 01:56:29.274]  That's an even more dangerous sign, I think.
[01:56:29.734 --> 01:56:30.194]  Well, it is.
[01:56:30.274 --> 01:56:33.515]  I mean, first of all, there is an engineering going on of
[01:56:34.167 --> 01:56:34.628]  I think so.
[01:56:48.869 --> 01:56:51.010]  Marrow is going to be the collapse of the dollar.
[01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.590]  And they said it!
[01:56:51.610 --> 01:56:54.311]  They said, through a crisis, we're going to get this, little bastards.
[01:56:54.671 --> 01:56:58.033]  Rob, Robert passed during an interview, a Spanish interview, and I questioned him.
[01:56:58.073 --> 01:56:59.033]  He said it to me, too.
[01:56:59.553 --> 01:57:07.476]  He said that the next 9-11 is going to be the kind of crisis we may, it may end up advancing North American integration.
[01:57:07.917 --> 01:57:11.518]  If he's thinking that and already anticipating that, it scares me.
[01:57:12.228 --> 01:57:23.035]  We're going to be back in 70 seconds, Doctor, to finish up your statement on that, and then take phone calls for another 30 minutes, and then I'm going to try to twist his arm and be back on again next week, because everything is fast and furious.
[01:57:23.075 --> 01:57:28.278]  I mean, just since he was on last week, he's written a bunch of articles, huge new developments, good, bad, and ugly.
[01:57:28.618 --> 01:57:30.500]  We'll be right back, 1-800-259-9931.
[01:57:33.722 --> 01:57:37.964]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.742 --> 01:57:53.947]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.587 --> 01:57:55.408]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:57.070]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.731 --> 01:58:01.415]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.915 --> 01:58:05.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.946 --> 01:58:12.227]  The powers that be are in full damage control mode.
[01:58:12.247 --> 01:58:15.049]  They're up to their necks and the water is rising.
[01:58:15.729 --> 01:58:18.670]  They don't have enough fingers to fill all the cracks in the dam of lies.
[01:58:18.710 --> 01:58:23.452]  That's a comment on the dig page to an article we've got up about the murder of Pat Tillman.
[01:58:24.526 --> 01:58:25.646]  Please continue, Dr. Corsi.
[01:58:25.666 --> 01:58:31.308]  We're going to go to phone calls on what you're pointing out about the globalist engineering, this collapse.
[01:58:31.508 --> 01:58:39.550]  If we're able to get the light on them now, do you see them lessening the blow, or it does seem they're just going for broke?
[01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:44.551]  Well, they're going to start going for broke, but they're going to try to cover it up as much as they can.
[01:58:44.571 --> 01:58:47.751]  I think what I'm going to refer to is your question about George Bush.
[01:58:48.191 --> 01:58:50.312]  They're trying to tell everybody the economy is fine.
[01:58:50.799 --> 01:59:02.749]  There's an article in the current issue of the Council on Foreign Relations magazine, which I thought was a remarkable article, because it was written by two... According to Fox News, CFR doesn't exist.
[01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:03.429]  Sorry.
[01:59:03.469 --> 01:59:19.362]  Well, the Council on Foreign Relations article was written by two professors, a chemist, she was a political science professor at Yale, and Matthew Slaughter, who is at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, he is on, Slaughter is on the Council on Foreign Relations,
[01:59:20.064 --> 01:59:22.566]  He's a Senior Fellow for Business and Globalization.
[01:59:22.586 --> 01:59:24.447]  He has a staff paid position.
[01:59:24.927 --> 01:59:30.911]  They finally disclosed in this article the research that shows that the real wages of U.S.
[01:59:30.951 --> 01:59:37.835]  workers between 2000 and 2005, 96.6% of all U.S.
[01:59:37.915 --> 01:59:41.117]  workers lost real wages due to globalism.
[01:59:41.577 --> 01:59:45.540]  They finally published this research and they said the only ones who are gaining
[01:59:46.067 --> 01:59:50.149]  Are the top CEOs, the lawyers and the MBAs who work with them.
[01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:52.151]  Now I had to look and say, why are they publishing this?
[01:59:52.651 --> 01:59:54.632]  Because it sounds like it's against globalism.
[01:59:54.652 --> 02:00:04.638]  And their argument was that if the globalists don't do something quickly, there's going to be a backlash and the rate of globalism is going to slow down.
[02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:07.791]  So they're trying to get out in front of this?
[02:00:24.179 --> 02:00:26.360]  That, you know, 96.6% of U.S.
[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:28.100]  workers have lost real wages.
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:28.761]  It's apparent.
[02:00:29.181 --> 02:00:31.782]  I don't care what George Bush says about how great the economy is.
[02:00:31.802 --> 02:00:37.483]  Well, Dr. Corsi, being informed on this, do you ever just get physically mad that they've done this to America?
[02:00:37.944 --> 02:00:38.644]  Absolutely.
[02:00:38.664 --> 02:00:41.485]  I channel it through all the writing I'm doing.
[02:00:41.525 --> 02:00:46.006]  I'm writing three or four articles a day, and the book has done extremely well.
[02:00:46.046 --> 02:00:48.927]  I'm trying to be on four or five hours of radio a day with the book.
[02:00:49.587 --> 02:00:51.248]  The book is now in its third printing.
[02:00:51.826 --> 02:00:56.267]  I mean, Alex, you've done a huge job of getting this book out to your audience.
[02:00:57.028 --> 02:00:58.248]  We can't keep them in stock.
[02:00:58.748 --> 02:01:00.369]  We just rushed into a third printing.
[02:01:00.409 --> 02:01:01.569]  We're scheduling a fourth.
[02:01:02.309 --> 02:01:04.350]  I'm doing everything I can to get it out there in this book.
[02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:06.290]  We can't keep it stocked even in the stores.
[02:01:06.951 --> 02:01:07.951]  It's just flying out.
[02:01:07.971 --> 02:01:11.512]  I think it's because people, it's easy to read.
[02:01:12.450 --> 02:01:13.651]  It's fully documented.
[02:01:34.781 --> 02:01:35.721]  Go ahead, Dr. Corsi, sorry.
[02:01:35.761 --> 02:01:41.024]  Well, it's just, you know, and now we've got congressmen like Duncan Hunter introducing resolutions.
[02:01:41.064 --> 02:01:48.246]  There's 14 states now that have passed resolutions saying no North American Union, no NAFTA superhighways.
[02:01:48.747 --> 02:01:52.268]  I even caught, this week, the mayor of Oklahoma City.
[02:01:52.308 --> 02:01:53.669]  I publish it in WorldNetDaily.
[02:01:54.189 --> 02:01:59.951]  In 2004, at a conference, he signed a declaration of North American integration.
[02:02:00.952 --> 02:02:02.672]  And it had been hidden since 2004.
[02:02:02.772 --> 02:02:03.352]  We uncovered it.
[02:02:05.188 --> 02:02:10.573]  The mayor, Mick Cornett, called me up and retracted his signing that document.
[02:02:11.154 --> 02:02:13.396]  Oh, have you written this up yet?
[02:02:13.416 --> 02:02:14.017]  This is huge!
[02:02:14.357 --> 02:02:16.619]  Oh my God, I can't even keep track of it.
[02:02:16.639 --> 02:02:17.240]  You know, stay there.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:21.785]  Rattle through any other key points you haven't made before we go to calls, because I want to hear all these.
[02:02:22.525 --> 02:02:27.971]  Dr. Corsi, folks, he's in there burrowed in, literally just tracking everything he can.
[02:02:28.872 --> 02:02:30.595]  And that's why we have him here each week.
[02:02:30.615 --> 02:02:31.776]  We are so honored to have him.
[02:02:32.036 --> 02:02:34.640]  The Late Great USA available at InfoWars.com right now or 888-253-3139.
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:36.142]  I got a plan when we get back.
[02:02:36.162 --> 02:02:37.704]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.434 --> 02:02:53.902]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.283 --> 02:03:01.914]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:09.643]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.043 --> 02:03:21.468]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.788 --> 02:03:25.290]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:27.711]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.011 --> 02:03:31.793]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:50.241]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:50.301 --> 02:03:57.623]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:57.763 --> 02:04:08.425]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:08.605 --> 02:04:13.146]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:13.426 --> 02:04:18.430]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:04:18.630 --> 02:04:21.572]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.792 --> 02:04:31.598]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:04:45.307 --> 02:04:49.570]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:04:49.831 --> 02:04:54.654]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:54.934 --> 02:04:56.255]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:56.435 --> 02:04:59.777]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:05:11.545 --> 02:05:13.987]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[02:05:20.212 --> 02:05:21.153]  No animal testing.
[02:05:21.413 --> 02:05:22.734]  I use them and love them.
[02:05:22.754 --> 02:05:24.356]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:05:24.636 --> 02:05:25.777]  And I say big time.

[02:05:44.991 --> 02:05:50.055]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.415 --> 02:05:52.737]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.177 --> 02:06:00.102]  Alright, I'm going to go through your calls quickly for Dr. Courtsing here in just a moment.
[02:06:02.265 --> 02:06:06.367]  But it comes down to this, and my plan is what I've been saying for the last year, but I mean it more than ever.
[02:06:06.387 --> 02:06:07.367]  We've got to codify it.
[02:06:08.268 --> 02:06:09.668]  Blame the perpetrators.
[02:06:10.349 --> 02:06:13.770]  The globalists do sampling, focus groups, testing.
[02:06:14.050 --> 02:06:14.810]  They admit they do.
[02:06:15.491 --> 02:06:17.472]  And they're not going to completely hammer the economy.
[02:06:17.492 --> 02:06:19.512]  They're not going to completely blow out our currency.
[02:06:20.173 --> 02:06:21.173]  They're doing it right now.
[02:06:22.734 --> 02:06:25.235]  Unless they think they can position themselves and survive it.
[02:06:25.255 --> 02:06:27.236]  And that's what the Financial Times of London said a year ago.
[02:06:27.496 --> 02:06:29.737]  They said, we've got to bring America down slowly so they don't know.
[02:06:30.481 --> 02:06:32.602]  So there's not a global panic that this could spark.
[02:06:32.922 --> 02:06:39.126]  I've heard NPR brag, oh, Americans live too well, we're being brought into the global community through napkin gad and globalization.
[02:06:39.166 --> 02:06:40.847]  I mean, they openly brag, folks, okay?
[02:06:41.127 --> 02:06:42.928]  When I was in college, they were teaching this stuff.
[02:06:43.408 --> 02:06:50.072]  Dr. Corsi and I went to, you know, Harvard and got his doctorate there, and I'll guarantee you, I've never asked him this, but I guarantee you that's all he heard there.
[02:06:50.593 --> 02:06:53.014]  This is, you get your education being around these people.
[02:06:53.912 --> 02:06:56.855]  And it is off the charts how much they hate this country.
[02:06:57.335 --> 02:06:58.916]  But again, it's the elite doing this.
[02:06:58.937 --> 02:07:01.499]  They sold the left that, oh, it'll help the poor.
[02:07:01.559 --> 02:07:04.541]  No, this is by design for the elite to destroy the middle class.
[02:07:05.342 --> 02:07:10.266]  If we expose who's behind the terror, either way you look at it, they'll stop carrying out the terror.
[02:07:11.307 --> 02:07:14.530]  If we expose that they're behind the terror by leaving the borders open, they'll have to shut those down.
[02:07:14.810 --> 02:07:15.591]  So that's what's happening.
[02:07:16.031 --> 02:07:21.976]  If we expose they're behind the implosion of the economy and that globalism's killed America's industry, they'll back off.
[02:07:24.128 --> 02:07:38.132]  Dr. Corsi, A, do you agree with the fact that we need to expose them, so even if they go ahead and plunge us, at least they will then have a bad name in implementing the next phase of what they're doing, and do you have ideas of how to implement that?
[02:07:38.452 --> 02:07:39.773]  Well, yes, and they do back off.
[02:07:39.813 --> 02:07:51.236]  I mean, that's why I think this story on the Oklahoma City Mayor, Mick Cornett, who did sign, and I got it and published the document, truly called a declaration of North American integration.
[02:07:51.832 --> 02:07:53.934]  It was signed by 90 top people.
[02:07:54.514 --> 02:07:58.016]  He signed it, and I pointed it out to him in World Net Daily.
[02:07:58.197 --> 02:08:01.339]  The next morning he called me up and he repudiated it.
[02:08:01.839 --> 02:08:05.101]  He said it was a stupid thing to get involved with three years ago.
[02:08:05.762 --> 02:08:07.863]  I don't remember what I was thinking at the time.
[02:08:08.003 --> 02:08:13.507]  Well, he's busy posing as a conservative over there, and you know it's more secret, two-faced behavior.
[02:08:13.547 --> 02:08:14.948]  What did you tell him?
[02:08:14.988 --> 02:08:16.249]  Well, I got him on record.
[02:08:16.269 --> 02:08:17.690]  I said, I'm going to record this.
[02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:18.451]  I recorded it all.
[02:08:19.521 --> 02:08:22.082]  He won a record that he did not favor North America.
[02:08:22.262 --> 02:08:23.463]  Oh, I wish we could air that!
[02:08:24.043 --> 02:08:28.685]  Well, it's the rules of the FCC.
[02:08:28.745 --> 02:08:31.206]  I can do it on my own notes, but I can't play it on the air.
[02:08:31.266 --> 02:08:31.987]  No, no, I understand.
[02:08:32.027 --> 02:08:33.007]  Unless he agrees to it.
[02:08:33.087 --> 02:08:34.248]  Unless he agrees to it.
[02:08:34.568 --> 02:08:39.390]  He said that he agreed that he was at the meeting, but I wanted to record it.
[02:08:39.770 --> 02:08:41.591]  So whatever came down to it, he didn't say it.
[02:08:41.651 --> 02:08:42.852]  I do have it on tape.
[02:08:43.332 --> 02:08:44.492]  He said, I was at the meeting.
[02:08:44.512 --> 02:08:45.713]  It was a long time ago.
[02:08:46.193 --> 02:08:48.074]  I've learned a lot in the last few years.
[02:08:48.655 --> 02:08:54.677]  He went on record as opposing bringing the Trans-Texas Corridor up into Oklahoma.
[02:08:54.697 --> 02:08:56.177]  Well, he better do it!
[02:08:56.337 --> 02:08:59.418]  He better not just say he opposes, he better work his butt off!
[02:08:59.699 --> 02:09:09.082]  Well, then we got, you know, then I was called, I interviewed Oklahoma Republican Senator Randy Brogdon, who got through the Oklahoma Legislature one of these motions.
[02:09:09.722 --> 02:09:13.183]  It was House Resolution 10, no, it was Concurrent Resolution 10.
[02:09:14.201 --> 02:09:25.255]  He got it through that the Oklahoma legislature said no North American Union, no NAFTA superhighways, and he said, well I'm going to call on Oklahoma City Mayor Cornett now to help me with the legislature.
[02:09:25.715 --> 02:09:32.704]  So now that he's on the record as having been exposed that he signed this declaration of North American integration,
[02:09:33.204 --> 02:09:40.848]  Alex, how much more blatant can you get than to name something a Declaration of North American Integration, and then to hide the fact the document existed?
[02:09:40.928 --> 02:09:47.390]  Well, I've got a young lady coming up who brought up the CFR and the fact that Fred Thompson's been supportive of this, and we've confirmed that.
[02:09:47.971 --> 02:09:49.411]  She asked the question politely.
[02:09:49.531 --> 02:09:51.472]  They literally grabbed her and dragged her out.
[02:09:51.832 --> 02:09:52.553]  I read about that.
[02:09:52.693 --> 02:09:58.575]  And then Fox says, oh, that's just a crazy, see, talking about imaginary stuff.
[02:09:58.636 --> 02:09:59.356]  They laugh at her.
[02:09:59.696 --> 02:10:01.657]  But then they go on and say, but it is a good idea.
[02:10:02.918 --> 02:10:08.860]  Well, there's a whole US-China Business Council, again, that, you know, Thompson's been a supporter of.
[02:10:09.381 --> 02:10:10.881]  It's a massive organization.
[02:10:11.362 --> 02:10:13.963]  It's got, you know, two, three hundred US corporations.
[02:10:14.103 --> 02:10:15.663]  It's filled with Chinese agents.
[02:10:16.123 --> 02:10:20.745]  It's filled with Chinese agents, and the whole plan is to ship US manufacturing over to China.
[02:10:21.186 --> 02:10:24.407]  And Fred Thompson's law firm, Fred Thompson in Congress,
[02:10:24.887 --> 02:10:28.251]  His whole voting record, he voted to expand migrant worker programs.
[02:10:28.511 --> 02:10:35.077]  And then Giuliani is on the board of the law firm, a partner now, here in Texas, grabbing the infrastructure.
[02:10:35.097 --> 02:10:40.223]  Dave Bracewell and Giuliani in Houston, they're the sole legal representative of CINTRA.
[02:10:41.864 --> 02:10:45.666]  Which is a Spanish investor consortium that's going to finance the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:10:45.867 --> 02:10:47.888]  Why do you think Halliburton has fled to Dubai?
[02:10:47.908 --> 02:10:50.129]  I mean, I'm seeing them all evacuate.
[02:10:50.189 --> 02:10:51.650]  Why are they evacuating the country?
[02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:58.975]  Well, certainly operating out of Dubai gives them, you know, they have a lot less requirement for information disclosure.
[02:10:59.555 --> 02:11:02.497]  And because they've now become truly multinationals, the same as
[02:11:03.064 --> 02:11:07.727]  Chrysler saying it's going to abandon Detroit and go to China to make the cars.
[02:11:08.107 --> 02:11:11.850]  And remember what happened, folks, with all of this?
[02:11:12.871 --> 02:11:14.892]  First, they were going to get six ports, Dubai.
[02:11:15.172 --> 02:11:17.214]  Then it was going to be 21, then 40-something.
[02:11:17.814 --> 02:11:29.622]  Dr. Corsi, myself, and others, also, of course, George Norrie, Coast to Coast, AM, literally led the assault, made this a national issue, and then Halliburton comes in in a management contract and then moves to Dubai.
[02:11:29.862 --> 02:11:31.003]  I mean, this is just insane.
[02:11:31.804 --> 02:11:37.751]  And these ports in Mexico that are going to be linked by the Trans-Texas Corridor, down to Manzanilla and Lazaro Cardenas.
[02:11:37.891 --> 02:11:44.779]  And by the way, when they implode the dollar, when they implode the dollar, I was going to make this point before I forget, that allows the foreigners to even buy stuff up cheaper.
[02:11:45.099 --> 02:11:46.060]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:47.622]  That's in the process of happening.
[02:11:47.662 --> 02:11:50.986]  Dollars at historic low points against the Euro right now.
[02:11:51.810 --> 02:12:02.622]  And these ports in Mexico are operated by Lazaro Cardenas, which is a... and Lazaro Cardenas are operated by Hutchinson Wampoa, which is a communist Chinese ports operating firm.
[02:12:02.802 --> 02:12:06.206]  In fact, it's admitted that every ship is captained by a naval officer.
[02:12:07.047 --> 02:12:13.034]  Yes, and in fact, they're also... Hutchinson Wampoa is in a joint venture with Lockheed Martin.
[02:12:13.775 --> 02:12:28.302]  And through NASCO, the North American Super Corridor Coalition, they're putting sensors, RFID sensors, right now all up and down Interstate 35 to track the Chinese containers, all the containers moving up our Interstate 35.
[02:12:28.342 --> 02:12:33.145]  And they're trying to put in the inspection stickers of Texans a tracker chip.
[02:12:33.777 --> 02:12:44.680]  Well, that's right, and you know, Texas has already gone over to job classifications for the Texas government on, you know, North American job classifications.
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:46.280]  The whole thing has already been shifted.
[02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:51.962]  Dr. Corsi, it's fair to say it's not just the late great USA, as your book's great cover says it, the coming merger with Mexico and Canada.
[02:12:52.748 --> 02:13:03.778]  This is literally the overthrow of the United States by the corporate elite and the full and complete looting and gutting of the currency, the military, the culture, the borders, the sovereignty.
[02:13:04.299 --> 02:13:09.103]  I mean, we are complete... This is absolute, massive... This is military-style attack.
[02:13:09.144 --> 02:13:11.005]  This is concerted takeover.
[02:13:11.486 --> 02:13:14.869]  And I call it, I call it in the book, that it's a bureaucratic coup d'etat.
[02:13:16.109 --> 02:13:18.915]  The Bush administration is advancing through the bureaucracy.
[02:13:18.975 --> 02:13:21.040]  It's foisted on millions of American citizens.
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:24.246]  And if you think Hillary's going to save you, folks, you've got another thing coming.
[02:13:24.587 --> 02:13:26.090]  It's a Bush-Clinton, Bush-Clinton.
[02:13:27.182 --> 02:13:31.025]  That dynasty is going to continue to advance the globalist agenda.
[02:13:31.666 --> 02:13:38.152]  The Bush-Clinton families are going to be far closer to going back to when Clinton was governor of Arkansas than anybody really knows.
[02:13:38.212 --> 02:13:42.756]  You know, if Rush Limbaugh would talk about this, we could stop it, but he will not warn his listeners.
[02:13:43.117 --> 02:13:44.718]  Well, they've become Bush-bots.
[02:13:44.798 --> 02:13:45.639]  They're like robots.
[02:13:45.739 --> 02:13:49.342]  They can't tolerate anything that's said.
[02:13:50.384 --> 02:13:59.668]  They've gotten so used and conditioned to just supporting Republicans as if that meant they were conservatives and just bashing Democrats as if that meant they were saving the world to defeat liberals.
[02:14:00.128 --> 02:14:05.970]  They don't realize that on issues like globalism and immigration, the Democrats and the Republicans are the same.
[02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:06.971]  They're identical.
[02:14:07.851 --> 02:14:10.953]  You've got a Kennedy-McCain immigration bill.
[02:14:10.973 --> 02:14:14.234]  You've got 12 million illegal aliens in the United States.
[02:14:14.816 --> 02:14:16.817]  Oh, we all know it's more than 30 million.
[02:14:17.157 --> 02:14:19.399]  It's like 30 million, that's what they admit to.
[02:14:19.539 --> 02:14:25.742]  Listen, doctor, in the last year, this is not an exaggeration, there's got to be triple the illegal aliens.
[02:14:25.842 --> 02:14:27.903]  I mean, sir, I mean you can go... I agree.
[02:14:28.183 --> 02:14:31.085]  I documented that in Minutemen, the book I wrote with Jim Gilchrist.
[02:14:31.225 --> 02:14:33.466]  I am literally, you can just, it's like...
[02:14:34.086 --> 02:14:34.906]  It's like a joke.
[02:14:34.987 --> 02:14:35.847]  It's like a cartoon.
[02:14:36.247 --> 02:14:45.571]  Alex, what it means is, even just with the government's lowest numbers, it means one out of every ten people born in Mexico is living in the United States today as a Mexican citizen.
[02:14:46.135 --> 02:14:48.958]  Is that why they're racing to get the amnesty?
[02:14:48.998 --> 02:14:52.861]  Because they know when the economy implodes, it'll be even harder to get it?
[02:15:05.272 --> 02:15:12.853]  Absolutely, and it was a major setback, a major defeat, and it's got the Bush administration and the globalists concerned and in a run.
[02:15:12.993 --> 02:15:13.814]  Well, that's great news!
[02:15:13.854 --> 02:15:15.934]  How about the CFR report where they're panicking?
[02:15:16.074 --> 02:15:16.774]  Let's take a call.
[02:15:16.794 --> 02:15:17.194]  Absolutely.
[02:15:17.314 --> 02:15:19.395]  Tony in Florida, you're on the air with Dr. Corsi.
[02:15:19.655 --> 02:15:20.415]  Incredible interview.
[02:15:20.435 --> 02:15:21.335]  Go ahead, Tony.
[02:15:22.295 --> 02:15:24.175]  Yes, greetings, greetings, statesmen.
[02:15:24.215 --> 02:15:27.076]  Thank God that some people are still statesmen in this country.
[02:15:27.576 --> 02:15:28.616]  I have a basic question.
[02:15:28.636 --> 02:15:32.877]  I live in Florida, and this is pretty much the east, you know,
[02:15:33.556 --> 02:15:38.318]  Epicenter, New World Order, street cameras in every corner, CBS grabs kids.
[02:15:38.838 --> 02:15:53.184]  My question is, a couple of months ago, the governor here, Governor Crist, went ahead and signed an executive order mandating all of the local utility companies to start complying with these, you know, the global warming conferences.
[02:15:53.244 --> 02:15:54.865]  Oh yeah, that's the Global Tax, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:55.365 --> 02:15:58.366]  Now, my question is, I've been researching that, trying to educate people.
[02:15:58.386 --> 02:16:00.947]  I have a question to comment real briefly, though.
[02:16:01.387 --> 02:16:02.968]  How is this going to interplay
[02:16:03.604 --> 02:16:07.145]  In the coming Global Plantation, Animal Farm, whatever you want to call it.
[02:16:07.265 --> 02:16:08.425]  It's a seamless thing.
[02:16:08.485 --> 02:16:14.846]  The National Animal ID, Premises ID, the Global Warming Taxes, that's in the SPP document.
[02:16:14.866 --> 02:16:15.826]  Judicial Watch got it.
[02:16:15.846 --> 02:16:16.146]  Doctor?
[02:16:16.166 --> 02:16:17.186]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:16:17.246 --> 02:16:24.768]  I mean, this whole idea of, first of all, there's global warming and all the scientists agree that it's man-made and man-caused.
[02:16:24.848 --> 02:16:25.708]  It's just not true.
[02:16:26.608 --> 02:16:29.508]  The Earth has been cooling and warming for millions of years.
[02:16:29.528 --> 02:16:31.669]  Yeah, during the Bronze Age for 4,000 years it was 10 degrees hotter.
[02:16:33.451 --> 02:16:37.294]  And just about 15 years ago, they had a big scare that the Earth was going to freeze.
[02:16:37.894 --> 02:16:41.677]  There was a global cooling scare that preceded the global warming scare.
[02:16:42.278 --> 02:16:53.826]  It's just another agenda, a fear agenda, to drive people into, you know, basically again giving up sovereignty, letting these international organizations set the rules and pay more taxes.
[02:16:54.707 --> 02:16:56.008]  It's a very, you know, the whole thing is a hoax.
[02:16:57.797 --> 02:17:01.659]  Well, they say under the NAFTA highways they're going to grab all this land for the earth.
[02:17:01.699 --> 02:17:04.020]  I mean, just look, just ask yourself for a minute.
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:11.563]  They're going to build these four football field wide highways, these massive new NAFTA super highways, 4,000 miles of them in Texas.
[02:17:11.923 --> 02:17:14.684]  They're not doing that because they think that we're running out of oil.
[02:17:16.205 --> 02:17:16.785]  Absolutely.
[02:17:16.845 --> 02:17:18.006]  And what was your other statement, sir?
[02:17:18.806 --> 02:17:23.148]  My statement is that I've been researching this and fighting this since I was 19 years old.
[02:17:23.168 --> 02:17:25.469]  I'm a John Birch Society member and I've had
[02:17:26.081 --> 02:17:27.482]  Different run-ins with the organization.
[02:17:27.522 --> 02:17:30.363]  My question is, ultimately, who is to blame?
[02:17:30.663 --> 02:17:35.886]  Is it really the Globeless, or is it the people who are just not paying attention to what's going on?
[02:17:36.066 --> 02:17:37.186]  Well, it's both!
[02:17:37.367 --> 02:17:40.728]  Look, you've got evil people, and then when good men do nothing, you get trouble.
[02:17:41.208 --> 02:17:42.149]  Founding Fathers said that.
[02:17:45.538 --> 02:17:48.560]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:53.804]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:54.064 --> 02:17:58.407]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:58.707 --> 02:18:07.613]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:07.833 --> 02:18:11.436]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:11.736 --> 02:18:16.786]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:17.066 --> 02:18:23.779]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:24.272 --> 02:18:24.933]  What about you?
[02:18:25.573 --> 02:18:30.938]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:20:54.138 --> 02:20:56.279]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[02:20:56.439 --> 02:20:57.839]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:02.201]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[02:21:02.541 --> 02:21:05.662]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.

[02:21:50.605 --> 02:21:51.666]  Let's rout them!
[02:21:52.026 --> 02:21:53.386]  Let's kick them in the hind end!
[02:21:53.446 --> 02:21:54.387]  Come on, America!
[02:21:54.707 --> 02:22:13.492]  In 1814 we took a little trip Along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi We took a little bacon and we took a little beans And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin'
[02:22:13.892 --> 02:22:16.034]  Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:22:16.294 --> 02:22:17.615]  Old Hickory said.
[02:22:17.635 --> 02:22:21.639]  We looked down the river and we see the British come.
[02:22:21.759 --> 02:22:24.361]  And there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drum.
[02:22:24.381 --> 02:22:27.063]  They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.
[02:22:27.103 --> 02:22:29.726]  We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.
[02:22:29.866 --> 02:22:32.768]  We fired our guns and the British kept for coming.
[02:22:32.808 --> 02:22:35.230]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:22:35.310 --> 02:22:37.993]  We fired once more and they began to run.
[02:22:38.373 --> 02:22:40.495]  Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:22:46.298 --> 02:22:48.139]  Welcome back.
[02:22:48.199 --> 02:22:54.222]  I hope you get The Late Great USA however you get it.
[02:22:54.242 --> 02:22:56.124]  You get it at Infowars.com discounted.
[02:22:56.144 --> 02:22:57.604]  You get multiple copies.
[02:22:57.744 --> 02:23:04.148]  I want you to send us the number one on the New York Times bestseller list, The Late Great USA, available at Infowars.com.
[02:23:04.168 --> 02:23:05.809]  Jamming in two more calls for Dr. Corsi.
[02:23:06.109 --> 02:23:07.450]  Paul in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:23:07.470 --> 02:23:08.271]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:23:09.171 --> 02:23:09.792]  Then we'll go to Frank.
[02:23:09.812 --> 02:23:10.952]  Hello there.
[02:23:11.112 --> 02:23:11.413]  Hi.
[02:23:11.473 --> 02:23:11.993]  Go ahead, quickly.
[02:23:12.526 --> 02:23:14.007]  Yeah, okay, just a quick comment.
[02:23:14.147 --> 02:23:22.775]  I was in Italy last year and there was all these kids dressed in EU uniforms.
[02:23:22.935 --> 02:23:24.316]  Oh yeah, total brainwashing.
[02:23:24.336 --> 02:23:25.937]  They don't even let them vote on it over there.
[02:23:25.957 --> 02:23:28.840]  England doesn't want it, 90 plus percent, and they're just doing it.
[02:23:30.061 --> 02:23:32.243]  Yeah, and it's like this propaganda.
[02:23:32.283 --> 02:23:33.283]  They had them on roller skates.
[02:23:33.303 --> 02:23:36.806]  They must have had 20 kids skating around the city with EU shirts on.
[02:23:37.107 --> 02:23:39.408]  And now here in Vancouver, Canada, I see
[02:23:40.499 --> 02:23:45.125]  Mexicans in groups, when there's like celebrations or whatever, like pushing their flags all over the place.
[02:23:45.345 --> 02:23:49.510]  Hey, when I was in Ottawa, for no reason, we'd see people running around with Mexican flags everywhere.
[02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:50.611]  We have it on video.
[02:23:50.651 --> 02:23:51.292]  Dr. Corsi?
[02:23:51.773 --> 02:23:58.321]  Well, yes, and I was in Italy, too, last year, and they were getting ready to celebrate the 50th year of the European Union.
[02:23:58.341 --> 02:23:59.342]  It was all over the place.
[02:23:59.833 --> 02:24:02.756]  I didn't see anybody caring or watching, but they were sure hyping it.
[02:24:02.976 --> 02:24:04.958]  By the way, we got video of all over Europe.
[02:24:05.299 --> 02:24:07.601]  Literally, they had huge marching bands, jugglers.
[02:24:08.002 --> 02:24:09.503]  No one, no one showed up.
[02:24:09.724 --> 02:24:12.266]  Not even little knots of people to watch in major cities.
[02:24:12.787 --> 02:24:13.888]  No, it's just a big hype.
[02:24:13.968 --> 02:24:16.411]  I mean, the European Union is touting its own horn.
[02:24:17.332 --> 02:24:22.417]  Increasingly, the Italians want to go back to being Italians, the Germans to being Germans.
[02:24:22.938 --> 02:24:25.801]  I think the EU is a fraud that's ultimately going to unwind.
[02:24:26.001 --> 02:24:27.763]  What about the Mexicans running around Canada?
[02:24:27.823 --> 02:24:28.443]  I've seen that.
[02:24:29.004 --> 02:24:30.005]  It's incredible.
[02:24:30.025 --> 02:24:31.646]  I mean, the Mexicans are all over.
[02:24:32.107 --> 02:24:36.331]  If the Mexicans want to be the Mexican flag, they ought to be in Mexico.
[02:24:36.791 --> 02:24:46.120]  But the idea is that they're demanding that all of us, you know, as I say, when you end up having one of every five Mexicans born in Mexico living in the United States,
[02:24:46.616 --> 02:24:49.859]  As a Mexican citizen, we've already become a dual country.
[02:24:49.879 --> 02:24:50.900]  And that's the point!
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:53.882]  That's the point, is it's one thing to have all these Mexicans up here.
[02:24:53.902 --> 02:24:54.863]  I don't dislike Mexicans.
[02:24:55.183 --> 02:24:59.167]  It's that they don't like America, and they're waving those Mexican flags, and I'm getting mad!
[02:24:59.307 --> 02:25:07.113]  And we've got 40 Mexican consulate offices all through the United States, protecting their rights as Mexican nationals living in the United States.
[02:25:07.133 --> 02:25:08.054]  Yeah, I've had enough of it.
[02:25:08.734 --> 02:25:12.778]  And so what I saw in Canada, out of the blue, that's some normal behavior now?
[02:25:13.502 --> 02:25:14.023]  Exactly.
[02:25:14.043 --> 02:25:15.824]  Let me ask a caller real fast out of Corsi.
[02:25:16.024 --> 02:25:17.185]  That's normal, what I saw?
[02:25:18.185 --> 02:25:19.747]  Well, I mean, it's happening more and more.
[02:25:19.807 --> 02:25:24.450]  Like, hockey's pretty big here, and they were in the playoffs and whatever, and it was almost like they were paid.
[02:25:25.129 --> 02:25:27.371]  Almost like they're paid off to flash their flag.
[02:25:27.451 --> 02:25:28.711]  That's what it looked like to me.
[02:25:28.751 --> 02:25:29.652]  Anything else real fast?
[02:25:29.672 --> 02:25:30.313]  We've got to let you go.
[02:25:30.813 --> 02:25:31.673]  Okay, really quick.
[02:25:32.374 --> 02:25:34.375]  Has this always been a plan to merge the three countries?
[02:25:34.435 --> 02:25:43.741]  I mean, Benito Juarez, John A. McDonald, George Washington were all part of the best, you know... I have New York Times articles from 1937 talking about a North American Union.
[02:25:43.761 --> 02:25:44.342]  Dr. Corsi?
[02:25:44.762 --> 02:25:48.585]  Yeah, it's gone back a long ways and it's been a thought to combine the countries.
[02:25:49.205 --> 02:25:52.027]  It's gained momentum though since Vincenti Fox.
[02:25:52.665 --> 02:25:54.847]  And the Security and Prosperity Partnership in North America.
[02:25:54.867 --> 02:25:55.747]  Yeah, it's happening now.
[02:25:56.848 --> 02:25:59.831]  This is a direct assault to make it happen now.
[02:26:00.131 --> 02:26:01.952]  Folks, we always heard about the new world order coming.
[02:26:01.972 --> 02:26:03.514]  We always heard about that fabled day.
[02:26:03.534 --> 02:26:05.375]  It's now here, isn't it, Dr. Corsi?
[02:26:05.515 --> 02:26:06.456]  Yeah, it's upon us.
[02:26:06.536 --> 02:26:13.421]  I mean, the third summit of the Security and Prosperity Partnership is going to be in Ottawa, Canada on August 20th and 21st.
[02:26:13.501 --> 02:26:14.442]  I intend to be there.
[02:26:14.462 --> 02:26:15.363]  I'm going to report on it.
[02:26:16.085 --> 02:26:17.386]  This is now out front.
[02:26:17.466 --> 02:26:19.366]  It's getting increasingly in the open.
[02:26:19.547 --> 02:26:22.868]  Well, I'm excited to hear you're coming to Texas.
[02:26:23.268 --> 02:26:25.989]  I always love bouncing back and forth here and brainstorming with you.
[02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:28.550]  So let's definitely get you in studio and videotape it.
[02:26:28.570 --> 02:26:30.291]  I'll put it on local television as well.
[02:26:30.331 --> 02:26:34.133]  Maybe get you hooked up with one of the local bookstores like Brave New Books.
[02:26:34.233 --> 02:26:35.173]  I think it'd be great.
[02:26:35.862 --> 02:26:40.585]  I'm looking forward to spending a couple of days down there in Austin and getting in the studio with you, maybe both days.
[02:26:41.246 --> 02:26:50.372]  Well, Dr. Corsi, let me hold you over the break for two minutes because I want to go to at least one more caller who's been holding the longest, Frank in Arizona, to talk to you, and then we'll let you go by about 36 after.
[02:26:50.412 --> 02:26:50.852]  Is that cool?
[02:26:53.015 --> 02:26:54.236]  Is that good, Dr. Corsi?
[02:26:54.256 --> 02:26:54.977]  Yes, that's cool.
[02:26:54.997 --> 02:26:55.437]  That's great.
[02:26:55.717 --> 02:26:56.298]  Fantastic.
[02:26:56.338 --> 02:26:58.680]  We'll be right back here in just a few minutes.
[02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:00.942]  We'll finish up with one call for Dr. Corsi.
[02:27:00.962 --> 02:27:04.005]  Then I've got this young lady coming on who was grabbed by these people.
[02:27:04.325 --> 02:27:09.970]  Don't forget that the murder of Pat Tillman is now, uh, complete.
[02:27:10.050 --> 02:27:14.634]  I mean, it is openly now being talked about by Keith Overman, by Wesley Clark.
[02:27:14.714 --> 02:27:20.759]  It is openly being talked about by the military doctors, the investigators, everybody.
[02:27:21.756 --> 02:27:27.981]  And so don't forget that stuff on PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:27:28.061 --> 02:27:29.542]  Okay, a few more minutes with Dr. Corsi.
[02:27:29.942 --> 02:27:34.165]  His book, The Late Great USA, get it at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:27:34.505 --> 02:27:35.045]  Do not wait!

[02:27:37.067 --> 02:27:39.108]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.029 --> 02:27:42.691]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:49.532 --> 02:28:56.317]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[02:28:57.037 --> 02:29:04.022]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, B.I.
[02:29:04.482 --> 02:29:05.142]  Lenin, on them.
[02:29:06.003 --> 02:29:10.706]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[02:29:11.286 --> 02:29:15.229]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.

[02:29:46.457 --> 02:29:47.518]  The Digestive Tract.
[02:29:47.938 --> 02:29:50.840]  A natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[02:29:51.221 --> 02:29:56.204]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[02:29:56.625 --> 02:29:58.506]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[02:29:59.230 --> 02:30:06.256]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[02:30:06.716 --> 02:30:11.660]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.

[02:30:24.111 --> 02:30:25.492]  Energy to use on other things.
[02:30:26.064 --> 02:30:27.726]  Besides worrying about constipation.

[02:30:59.122 --> 02:31:00.183]  Suit up, boys!
[02:31:00.583 --> 02:31:02.164]  This is a battle for the Republic.
[02:31:02.204 --> 02:31:07.987]  You're living the first days of a fight that's only going to intensify and will probably go hot.
[02:31:08.507 --> 02:31:14.130]  We don't want that, but whatever it takes to defend the Republic, we are not going to stop.
[02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:16.951]  We are winning great victories for the forces we've got.
[02:31:17.011 --> 02:31:18.592]  Why stand you idly there?
[02:31:18.612 --> 02:31:26.216]  We're going to go to this young lady who asked Lord Thompson, the open border New World Order piece of filth, a question.
[02:31:26.863 --> 02:31:34.367]  Well he was down here with his stupid cowboy hat on, posing as a good old boy, and she got snatched for it.
[02:31:34.427 --> 02:31:35.968]  Jessica Wilson coming up in a moment.
[02:31:36.768 --> 02:31:38.009]  Finishing up with Dr. Corsi.
[02:31:38.049 --> 02:31:39.850]  Frank in Arizona, we held him over just for you.
[02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:40.290]  Go ahead.
[02:31:40.310 --> 02:31:49.735]  Hey, there's a couple predictions made by this guy on Coast to Coast, and I just wanted to get your input on them.
[02:31:50.789 --> 02:31:54.310]  I was actually listening last night because I was on and then I was editing afterwards.
[02:31:54.850 --> 02:31:58.431]  Sean David Morton sounds like a really nice fellow, very intelligent.
[02:31:58.851 --> 02:32:01.612]  He says he gets his info unorthodox way.
[02:32:02.532 --> 02:32:08.233]  Maybe he's got a good brain and he's made a lot of good predictions, but you want me to comment on his predictions about the economy imploding?
[02:32:08.553 --> 02:32:11.194]  I mean, that's scientifically looking at the economics.
[02:32:11.594 --> 02:32:13.174]  Dr. Corsi, who's got a Ph.D.
[02:32:13.495 --> 02:32:17.075]  at looking at these situations, says that it's... but I mean, go ahead.
[02:32:18.136 --> 02:32:19.496]  Yeah, basically he had a
[02:32:20.014 --> 02:32:20.815]  Yeah, two of them.
[02:32:21.256 --> 02:32:24.421]  One where there'd be hyperinflation occurring in November.
[02:32:24.521 --> 02:32:25.723]  We already have hyperinflation.
[02:32:26.424 --> 02:32:26.664]  Yeah.
[02:32:27.125 --> 02:32:32.874]  And then the other one, he said there'd be a... the president would not finish his term.
[02:32:33.856 --> 02:32:35.258]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:32:36.019 --> 02:32:37.180]  He's always plugging me.
[02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:38.241]  He sounds like a really nice guy.
[02:32:38.281 --> 02:32:39.222]  I need to get him on here.
[02:32:39.502 --> 02:32:41.203]  It's just that's not quite my genre.
[02:32:41.483 --> 02:32:43.925]  I'm all about what you can prove and people can't even deal with that.
[02:32:44.386 --> 02:32:46.347]  So maybe I'll get Sean David Morton on.
[02:32:46.387 --> 02:32:47.008]  I need to do that.
[02:32:47.969 --> 02:32:49.690]  But don't think that's going to save you.
[02:32:49.730 --> 02:32:50.771]  I want Bush to be punished.
[02:32:51.151 --> 02:32:53.833]  But the Democrats are just as bad or worse.
[02:32:53.853 --> 02:32:54.654]  That's my only point.
[02:32:56.395 --> 02:32:58.656]  It's like chopping off one arm and they've still got another arm.
[02:32:58.676 --> 02:32:59.797]  You've got to go with the head.
[02:33:00.317 --> 02:33:01.198]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:33:01.238 --> 02:33:03.699]  Dr. Corsi, that's a good note to end on.
[02:33:03.719 --> 02:33:05.380]  What do you think about Bush finishing his term?
[02:33:05.420 --> 02:33:14.005]  And, I mean, if major brokerage houses are saying we're really at 13.6 per annum, that's hyperinflation right there if it's double digit.
[02:33:14.025 --> 02:33:14.425]  What do you say?
[02:33:14.765 --> 02:33:17.167]  Well, we're certainly in inflation right now.
[02:33:17.227 --> 02:33:19.468]  Inflation's much higher than the government's admitting it.
[02:33:19.488 --> 02:33:20.629]  There's no question about it.
[02:33:21.029 --> 02:33:26.172]  Just look at energy prices and look at food prices, and they mostly try to rule those out of the indexes.
[02:33:26.992 --> 02:33:31.495]  With regards to Bush, you know, living or serving out his term, I have no crystal ball.
[02:33:31.975 --> 02:33:39.640]  I would think that the Democrats would be praying that he does live out his term and serve it, because they've got the perfect... I mean, I don't think his ratings could go any lower.
[02:33:40.476 --> 02:33:47.186]  I think the sympathy that would occur should he be removed from office or leave would be something the Democrats wouldn't want.
[02:33:47.266 --> 02:33:49.229]  He'd probably get a 20% boost out of it.
[02:33:49.609 --> 02:33:54.837]  Yeah, and I think that right now with him as unpopular and unable to do anything,
[02:33:55.362 --> 02:34:03.148]  We've been pushing the Shamlisty Bill through Congress, coming back from Albania, saying, I'll see you at the signing ceremony.
[02:34:03.188 --> 02:34:11.675]  And, you know, we've had George Bush ruin his career on that, but we've had John McCain, his presidential... Well, his arrogance really helps, doesn't it?
[02:34:11.955 --> 02:34:14.277]  Absolutely, because, you know, it's right in your face.
[02:34:14.917 --> 02:34:21.122]  And I think the conservatives, even Republican conservatives, left and right, are abandoning Bush now in droves.
[02:34:21.242 --> 02:34:22.904]  That's the problem.
[02:34:22.944 --> 02:34:24.145]  And I agree that, by the way, this...
[02:34:25.177 --> 02:34:27.137]  Fred Thompson is no conservative.
[02:34:27.677 --> 02:34:31.978]  He's a dime store cowboy, if there is one.
[02:34:36.039 --> 02:34:48.401]  I haven't seen anything real about him taking his red pickup truck from campaign stop to campaign stop in Tennessee is about as good as it gets.
[02:34:48.941 --> 02:34:51.542]  He's a globalist, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:34:51.582 --> 02:34:54.302]  He supports the US-China Business Group.
[02:34:55.243 --> 02:34:56.664]  I wouldn't trust Fred Thompson.
[02:34:56.684 --> 02:35:00.145]  Rather, they could throw him from books over, but you can't throw him very far.
[02:35:00.425 --> 02:35:00.945]  Exactly.
[02:35:01.005 --> 02:35:02.706]  Dr. Corsi, thank you for the time.
[02:35:02.726 --> 02:35:08.168]  You're going to be popping in with us next week and reporting coming up in about three and a half weeks from Canada.
[02:35:08.488 --> 02:35:09.528]  God bless you and take care.
[02:35:09.829 --> 02:35:13.090]  And have people go to Amazon.com and write reviews of the book.
[02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:14.210]  They don't have to even buy it.
[02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:15.771]  Just review the book.
[02:35:15.831 --> 02:35:17.471]  It will help people get the word out.
[02:35:17.771 --> 02:35:18.412]  Absolutely.
[02:35:18.452 --> 02:35:18.992]  God bless you.
[02:35:19.372 --> 02:35:24.113]  Thank you, God bless you, and I really appreciate the opportunity to be with you again today, Alex.
[02:35:24.213 --> 02:35:24.573]  Thank you.
[02:35:24.733 --> 02:35:25.633]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[02:35:25.753 --> 02:35:28.114]  All right, there goes Dr. Corsi, soon to be in Austin in the next few weeks.
[02:35:28.254 --> 02:35:30.495]  Okay, I appreciate her holding.
[02:35:30.555 --> 02:35:37.276]  I want to go to this Fox News clip in just a moment, in the limited time we've got, but let's bring up Jessica Wilson first.
[02:35:37.296 --> 02:35:45.878]  She founded 9-11 Truth, a website there in, we've got a link to her site up on InfoWars.com, there in Houston, H-Town.
[02:35:46.701 --> 02:35:56.566]  And she's a real conservative Ron Paul supporter, and she politely goes up and asks Fred Thompson about the CFR, and then he laughs at her and says, I didn't know they were doing that.
[02:35:56.946 --> 02:35:57.607]  Real funny.
[02:35:58.107 --> 02:36:06.131]  And then on the Fox News piece, when they had her on, they edited that together with three minutes later, when they dragged her and grabbed her off to make it just sound like she's screaming and acting crazy.
[02:36:07.495 --> 02:36:08.595]  Very disingenuous.
[02:36:08.656 --> 02:36:10.676]  And the Fox News guy, well, we've got the clip.
[02:36:10.716 --> 02:36:11.737]  It's up on JonesReport.com.
[02:36:11.757 --> 02:36:12.597]  We'll play some of it in a minute.
[02:36:13.337 --> 02:36:19.600]  But, Jessica, it's another testament, though, that you took action, and now it's gotten a lot of attention to the fact that he's not a conservative.
[02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:21.540]  And there's Jerome Corsi saying the same thing.
[02:36:22.461 --> 02:36:24.061]  Yeah, but it was pretty absurd.
[02:36:24.381 --> 02:36:29.063]  I really couldn't... When it took place, I really didn't think it was going to happen.
[02:36:29.123 --> 02:36:32.545]  I mean, when the cops grabbed me back, I think that's the main reason why...
[02:36:34.318 --> 02:36:36.440]  My voice cracked and I was like, are you serious?
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:37.461]  Is this really happening?
[02:36:37.481 --> 02:36:39.503]  Well, I've seen photos and video of it now.
[02:36:39.603 --> 02:36:45.949]  The big men literally were pressed up against you, squeezing you with their bodies up against you.
[02:36:46.970 --> 02:36:50.333]  Since when do they get a woman by having one standing back and one in front?
[02:36:51.093 --> 02:36:56.358]  I mean, because at first people saw the video from your camera as they're grabbing you and you can't see that.
[02:36:56.699 --> 02:36:58.060]  Describe what they did to you.
[02:36:59.079 --> 02:37:01.500]  Well, they came up behind me and there were actually four of them.
[02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:02.320]  It wasn't just two.
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:04.701]  All four of them dragged me outside.
[02:37:06.122 --> 02:37:08.302]  But why are they pressing themselves up against you?
[02:37:08.623 --> 02:37:09.863]  That's a new procedure.
[02:37:10.663 --> 02:37:11.604]  I have no idea.
[02:37:11.624 --> 02:37:16.505]  I'm not very big and I can't do very much.
[02:37:16.545 --> 02:37:18.586]  Why did they just ask you to go?
[02:37:18.646 --> 02:37:20.667]  Why did they sandwich you and grab you?
[02:37:21.212 --> 02:37:24.334]  I think that was my main concern when I was being pulled away.
[02:37:24.354 --> 02:37:30.078]  I was asking why they're holding on to me and why they're grabbing me because I myself was walking back when they were doing it.
[02:37:30.158 --> 02:37:33.440]  So I really don't have an answer for that and that's one of the main reasons.
[02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:36.782]  Well, I've seen women grubbed at the airport and there's been big controversies about that.
[02:37:37.702 --> 02:37:38.943]  My God, this country's gone.
[02:37:39.563 --> 02:37:40.444]  Now let's be clear.
[02:37:40.484 --> 02:37:41.865]  You politely asked the question.
[02:37:42.563 --> 02:37:45.224]  And then somebody grabs you and then you say, no I'm not going.
[02:37:45.264 --> 02:37:47.005]  So they run off and make some lie up.
[02:37:47.345 --> 02:37:52.428]  The cops come and you're such a dangerous little lady that they had to grab you.
[02:37:52.448 --> 02:37:53.128]  This is incredible.
[02:37:53.928 --> 02:37:54.748]  Yeah, yep.
[02:37:55.188 --> 02:38:05.171]  But to me, the big news here is, is that in America, in a press conference, asking a question Fred Thompson's minions didn't like, got you grabbed by the police.
[02:38:05.191 --> 02:38:08.593]  And if you had touched them in any way, they would have charged you with felony assault.
[02:38:08.813 --> 02:38:09.853]  Thank God you didn't.
[02:38:10.253 --> 02:38:12.734]  And then when Thompson comes out, they wouldn't let you go either.
[02:38:13.174 --> 02:38:15.995]  But, I mean, this is kidnapping in America for asking questions.
[02:38:16.035 --> 02:38:18.736]  Are you going to file police, file reports on these cops?
[02:38:19.156 --> 02:38:23.017]  And A, were they airport police, or were they Houston's finest?
[02:38:23.775 --> 02:38:27.337]  I think they were hired by the Hanger to, um, they were HPD.
[02:38:27.397 --> 02:38:29.137]  Yeah, I saw their H-Town.
[02:38:29.357 --> 02:38:30.598]  They were TSA as well.
[02:38:31.418 --> 02:38:34.920]  And they, um, I mean, I don't know if I can press charges.
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:36.400]  I don't know, I don't know if I can.
[02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:37.961]  Yeah, well, it's not even pressing charges.
[02:38:38.001 --> 02:38:39.802]  You need to file the complaint.
[02:38:40.222 --> 02:38:44.664]  I mean, frankly, some of the worst cops in America are in New York and then Houston.
[02:38:45.064 --> 02:38:48.005]  I mean, they are just, I've asked them for directions politely and they're like, huh?
[02:38:48.386 --> 02:38:48.986]  What, you want?
[02:38:50.325 --> 02:38:52.746]  But how do we get to the point in this country where A, Fox News is misrepresented
[02:39:11.773 --> 02:39:12.514]  Oh yeah.
[02:39:13.055 --> 02:39:18.462]  I mean, John Gibson, he had a fill-in pansy doing his show, and this guy tries every trick in the book.
[02:39:18.502 --> 02:39:21.045]  Let's just play some of this and then we'll both comment on it.
[02:39:21.065 --> 02:39:25.291]  We're going to play a few minutes of this to analyze this unbelievable propaganda.
[02:39:25.311 --> 02:39:25.631]  Here it is.
[02:39:30.643 --> 02:39:31.043]  We're good to go.
[02:39:52.634 --> 02:39:56.157]  And then they cut it in, and he goes, but that wasn't enough for her.
[02:39:56.577 --> 02:40:02.161]  And then they cut in when they're dragging her away, they cut out the first part of her going, no, don't, why are you dragging me away?
[02:40:02.461 --> 02:40:05.544]  To make it, again, misrepresentation, lying.
[02:40:05.704 --> 02:40:09.567]  They probably got actual CIA, I know they're at Fox, actually running this.
[02:40:09.587 --> 02:40:09.947]  Here it is.
[02:40:10.247 --> 02:40:12.068]  I just want to share with you some of the clips of this.
[02:40:12.088 --> 02:40:13.128]  Her name is Jessica Wilson.
[02:40:13.549 --> 02:40:16.970]  Here's what she had to say in her confrontation with Fred Thompson.
[02:40:17.311 --> 02:40:25.675]  So you're a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the same group that's forming the North American Union with Mexico and Canada.
[02:40:26.035 --> 02:40:27.796]  And you call yourself a conservative.
[02:40:28.256 --> 02:40:29.617]  And we are in Texas.
[02:40:30.057 --> 02:40:34.780]  And I need to understand why you're a member of that and why you support the North American Union.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.281]  I didn't know they were up to that.
[02:40:37.441 --> 02:40:38.021]  Oh, really?
[02:40:38.381 --> 02:40:39.001]  Really?
[02:40:39.041 --> 02:40:40.242]  Now, don't fuss up in there.
[02:40:40.262 --> 02:40:41.062]  You asked me a question.
[02:40:41.082 --> 02:40:43.103]  Let me answer it.
[02:40:43.203 --> 02:40:44.343]  And how'd that go?
[02:40:44.383 --> 02:40:45.223]  Was that the end of the question?
[02:40:45.243 --> 02:40:46.244]  Or the end of the conversation?
[02:40:47.164 --> 02:40:48.564]  I figure it was.
[02:40:48.624 --> 02:40:49.785]  Sir, they're asking me to leave.
[02:40:49.805 --> 02:40:50.385]  Stop right there.
[02:40:50.405 --> 02:40:51.125]  Stop right there.
[02:40:51.185 --> 02:40:52.166]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[02:40:52.186 --> 02:40:52.646]  Now, listen.
[02:40:53.206 --> 02:40:55.347]  You can all watch the unedited video on YouTube.
[02:40:55.407 --> 02:40:55.947]  They had it.
[02:40:56.827 --> 02:40:57.448]  What did they do?
[02:40:57.728 --> 02:40:58.608]  She asked her question.
[02:40:59.736 --> 02:41:01.177]  He doesn't really answer it.
[02:41:01.737 --> 02:41:02.918]  Then three minutes goes by.
[02:41:02.958 --> 02:41:03.899]  Here's somebody grab on her.
[02:41:03.939 --> 02:41:05.200]  She says she's not asking questions.
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:06.080]  She's in the press conference.
[02:41:07.021 --> 02:41:09.503]  That's nothing for a way reporters used to be, aggressive-wise.
[02:41:09.923 --> 02:41:11.124]  Then they come over and grab her.
[02:41:11.164 --> 02:41:12.444]  She says, why are cops grabbing me?
[02:41:12.485 --> 02:41:12.665]  Help!
[02:41:12.925 --> 02:41:15.827]  Hey, Thompson, you know, CFR, New World Order, 9-11.
[02:41:15.927 --> 02:41:20.710]  Oh, he said, now don't fuss at me.
[02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:21.571]  They cut the tape.
[02:41:23.832 --> 02:41:25.013]  Was that enough for her?
[02:41:26.010 --> 02:41:28.292]  When he was trying to be... No, she attacked again.
[02:41:28.732 --> 02:41:30.413]  Misrepresentation.
[02:41:30.433 --> 02:41:32.715]  You have been slandered by Fox News.
[02:41:32.935 --> 02:41:35.077]  But again, they're losing all credibility.
[02:41:35.097 --> 02:41:37.199]  The black ops squads over there are so dumb.
[02:41:37.459 --> 02:41:38.039]  Back to the tape.
[02:41:38.479 --> 02:41:41.962]  Well, I didn't know we were up to that.
[02:41:42.122 --> 02:41:42.743]  Oh, really?
[02:41:43.083 --> 02:41:43.703]  Really?
[02:41:43.743 --> 02:41:44.944]  Now, don't press that now.
[02:41:44.964 --> 02:41:45.725]  You asked me a question.
[02:41:45.745 --> 02:41:47.787]  Let me answer it.
[02:41:47.907 --> 02:41:48.547]  And how'd that go?
[02:41:49.068 --> 02:41:49.908]  Was that the end of the question?
[02:41:49.928 --> 02:41:50.909]  Or the end of the conversation?
[02:41:51.787 --> 02:41:54.089]  They're asking me to leave.
[02:41:54.129 --> 02:41:57.191]  You were a lobbyist for 18 years!
[02:41:57.251 --> 02:41:59.954]  You are not a real conservative, sir!
[02:42:00.114 --> 02:42:03.556]  What do you think about World Trade Center 7?
[02:42:03.596 --> 02:42:05.098]  It was an inside job!
[02:42:06.419 --> 02:42:08.460]  What do you think about World... Don't grab me!
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:09.861]  Why are you touching me?
[02:42:09.941 --> 02:42:10.562]  I don't care!
[02:42:10.642 --> 02:42:13.144]  I believe in my own accord!
[02:42:13.184 --> 02:42:14.065]  Do not touch me!
[02:42:21.286 --> 02:42:23.449]  Yeah, that is right from my wedding night.
[02:42:24.090 --> 02:42:24.771]  Get off of me.
[02:42:24.831 --> 02:42:26.153]  I mean, that gives me chills.
[02:42:26.313 --> 02:42:29.338]  Classic hip-hop, classic CIA Fox formula.
[02:42:29.959 --> 02:42:34.365]  Every 30 seconds on this show before she got on, we were listening to it, was a pervert comment.
[02:42:35.126 --> 02:42:37.907]  But a lot more... I mean, again, it's a formula.
[02:42:38.247 --> 02:42:40.888]  Oh, we're conservative, we're Christian, but we're the most perverted channel.
[02:42:41.108 --> 02:42:41.809]  They also do that.
[02:42:41.849 --> 02:42:43.909]  It's all to hit base brain.
[02:42:44.129 --> 02:42:53.713]  They always hit a sex comment to fire neurons in the lower... this is actual government documents, by the way... to fire lower areas of the brain to have animal, low-level, non-critical takeover.
[02:42:54.013 --> 02:43:02.396]  So they keep adding sex comments to have animal brain takeover to keep you out of a... so he primes it with a... I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:43:02.416 --> 02:43:03.237]  This is scientific.
[02:43:03.257 --> 02:43:04.397]  This is an operative.
[02:43:05.593 --> 02:43:10.080]  They prime it with a sex comment, and you watch Fox TV, they do this every minute or two.
[02:43:10.801 --> 02:43:16.269]  It doesn't matter what show it is, with a sex comment to prime animal brain functions to keep you out of higher levels.
[02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:18.192]  I'm not kidding, this is how they do it.
[02:43:18.553 --> 02:43:19.314]  But let's go back to it.
[02:43:20.667 --> 02:43:21.228]  1992, all over again.
[02:43:21.749 --> 02:43:26.576]  Now, Jessica Wilson is with Houston911Truth.org.
[02:43:26.636 --> 02:43:32.865]  That's the woman who you heard there confronting non-presidential candidate Fred Thompson.
[02:43:32.925 --> 02:43:33.286]  Here she is.
[02:43:33.326 --> 02:43:35.329]  Jessica, thanks for joining me here on the John Gibson Show.
[02:43:36.042 --> 02:43:36.642]  Hello, how are you?
[02:43:36.882 --> 02:43:37.323]  Great, great.
[02:43:37.383 --> 02:43:41.424]  Now, okay, so your problem, I'm just trying, help me out here.
[02:43:42.005 --> 02:43:48.067]  For me, I think for most Americans, Fred Thompson is a blank slate, which probably explains mostly why he's so popular.
[02:43:48.087 --> 02:43:49.368]  That and the fact he looks like Rush Limbaugh.
[02:43:49.708 --> 02:43:51.369]  That's why people, so many people like him.
[02:43:51.709 --> 02:43:57.532]  But you, you've done your research and you found that he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations?
[02:43:58.192 --> 02:43:58.372]  Yes.
[02:43:58.392 --> 02:43:59.412]  Are you familiar with that?
[02:43:59.813 --> 02:44:00.313]  Yes.
[02:44:00.873 --> 02:44:01.173]  Okay.
[02:44:01.613 --> 02:44:02.414]  Let's not talk about it.
[02:44:02.474 --> 02:44:03.114]  Let's not talk about it.
[02:44:05.032 --> 02:44:08.313]  Do you want me to discuss the CFR?
[02:44:08.513 --> 02:44:12.155]  I'm completely confused about what... You know they're listening though, right?
[02:44:12.755 --> 02:44:13.035]  Uh-huh.
[02:44:13.375 --> 02:44:13.595]  Yeah.
[02:44:14.095 --> 02:44:18.878]  Well, okay, but what is it that you have an objection to with the Council on Foreign Relations?
[02:44:19.078 --> 02:44:22.059]  Do it in a way that doesn't get us deported to the... Stop right there!
[02:44:22.119 --> 02:44:24.180]  Limbaugh years ago would say it didn't exist, remember?
[02:44:25.163 --> 02:44:26.104]  Now he won't talk about it.
[02:44:26.144 --> 02:44:27.025]  It's a kook detector.
[02:44:27.045 --> 02:44:33.833]  So see, first, oh, you're not supposed to talk about the leadership of our country openly who write every month they want one world government.
[02:44:34.580 --> 02:44:39.484]  The head of the group, Rockefeller, says he wants to end America, but see, she's got to be made fun of.
[02:44:39.564 --> 02:44:44.227]  Then he goes into this long diatribe about how we... Well, what's wrong with an Amaro?
[02:44:44.447 --> 02:44:45.628]  What's wrong with the North American Union?
[02:44:45.648 --> 02:44:46.729]  That's going to help us!
[02:44:47.169 --> 02:44:49.972]  But then he says it doesn't exist, and calls her crazy.
[02:44:50.012 --> 02:44:52.153]  He just goes... He starts playing Black Helicopters.
[02:44:52.173 --> 02:44:53.734]  Let's play a minute or two more, and then go to our guest.
[02:44:56.589 --> 02:44:57.590]  See, that's the thing.
[02:44:57.790 --> 02:45:01.071]  I mean, are you honestly afraid that we're going to be deported by talking about this?
[02:45:01.131 --> 02:45:01.912]  I mean, that's the thing.
[02:45:02.412 --> 02:45:05.934]  We're more afraid of our own government than the quote-unquote terrorists, right?
[02:45:05.954 --> 02:45:06.554]  I'm telling you.
[02:45:06.654 --> 02:45:16.679]  Anyway, so the CFR is basically an organization in Washington that is not part of our government, but there's parts of our government that are involved with it.
[02:45:16.859 --> 02:45:20.921]  It's like a think tank behind the North American Union.
[02:45:21.001 --> 02:45:22.082]  A think tank?
[02:45:23.354 --> 02:45:25.057]  The implication, a think tank.
[02:45:25.217 --> 02:45:26.759]  Ooh, thinking is bad.
[02:45:26.779 --> 02:45:28.962]  Well, they call themselves a think tank.
[02:45:28.982 --> 02:45:29.943]  Continue with this enemy.
[02:45:31.746 --> 02:45:32.988]  Yes, a think tank.
[02:45:33.028 --> 02:45:33.689]  Yes, I got you.
[02:45:33.729 --> 02:45:33.949]  Right.
[02:45:34.349 --> 02:45:34.550]  Uh-huh.
[02:45:35.166 --> 02:45:55.101]  I gotcha, and so, and they are, the CFR is among many organizations that, and individuals and organizations, who have proposed the North American Monetary Union, which if it were implemented would give America, Canada, and maybe even Mexico the same currency, true?
[02:45:55.121 --> 02:46:03.907]  Right, it's called the Amero, and it's not being discussed, and it's not being voted on by the American people, it's just basically being introduced by
[02:46:04.505 --> 02:46:06.746]  Politicians such as Greg Thompson.
[02:46:07.947 --> 02:46:08.367]  Wow.
[02:46:09.347 --> 02:46:10.768]  Oh, that's some nice music you got there.
[02:46:10.808 --> 02:46:12.909]  Yeah, it sounds pretty sinister here.
[02:46:12.929 --> 02:46:18.011]  Not on Bald Mountain by Edouard Grieg, that's alright, thank you.
[02:46:18.712 --> 02:46:21.153]  It definitely threatens the sovereignty of our nation, right?
[02:46:21.193 --> 02:46:24.575]  So, I mean... No, no, no, let me hear that.
[02:46:24.735 --> 02:46:31.558]  How would having the Amaro, a common North American currency, how would that threaten our sovereignty?
[02:46:32.199 --> 02:46:33.599]  Okay, it's not the same error.
[02:46:33.719 --> 02:46:35.740]  It's opening borders.
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:41.101]  So, people keep saying... Look, I don't have time to play it all.
[02:46:41.141 --> 02:46:42.281]  You can listen to Jones' report.
[02:46:42.321 --> 02:46:43.841]  He goes on to say it's a good idea.
[02:46:45.181 --> 02:46:48.102]  Now, understand, there's bills in Congress to stop this right now.
[02:46:48.182 --> 02:46:49.142]  It's now admitted.
[02:46:49.202 --> 02:46:50.942]  We've broken through their hoax denying it.
[02:46:50.982 --> 02:46:52.663]  Just like they said amnesty wasn't amnesty.
[02:46:53.823 --> 02:46:54.523]  Let's bring her up.
[02:46:54.983 --> 02:46:58.163]  Jessica, I mean, it went on and on for another six, seven minutes.
[02:46:59.624 --> 02:47:00.864]  This guy is just amazing.
[02:47:01.573 --> 02:47:09.318]  Yeah, it's great that they... I mean, they basically come out and say that it exists, but then I'm a conspiracy theorist for saying that it exists.
[02:47:09.539 --> 02:47:10.980]  Well, they always do that, yeah.
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:15.203]  And it's so backwards, the thinking, it's just incredible.
[02:47:15.243 --> 02:47:23.728]  Well, helicopters blew up a building and were thrown out by a police chief, and people had heart attacks by a nursing home, and then the paper said that they attacked.
[02:47:23.748 --> 02:47:24.549]  That was the headline.
[02:47:24.829 --> 02:47:27.531]  But then it said, I was a crazy person for not liking it.
[02:47:27.971 --> 02:47:29.272]  So, welcome to the club, yeah.
[02:47:29.733 --> 02:47:30.253]  Absurd.
[02:47:31.101 --> 02:47:38.304]  I mean, and what can you do to stop that, other than just keep going out with your own camera and recording it all by yourself?
[02:47:38.324 --> 02:47:39.085]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:47:39.105 --> 02:47:40.425]  These dogs don't learn new tricks.
[02:47:40.445 --> 02:47:42.346]  They keep doing this, and it isn't working.
[02:47:42.687 --> 02:47:45.308]  And I say, great, they just keep running themselves in the ground.
[02:47:45.628 --> 02:47:47.369]  See, the king has no clothes.
[02:47:47.709 --> 02:47:52.471]  Everybody finally sees that, but they're still dancing around like they're wearing a fancy outfit.
[02:47:52.511 --> 02:47:53.672]  I mean, they're just idiots.
[02:47:54.552 --> 02:47:54.832]  Right.
[02:47:55.513 --> 02:48:00.315]  These guys follow these manuals they're given, written up by the psych warfare experts in the government, and it's not working.
[02:48:01.144 --> 02:48:12.530]  Well, Fred Thompson walks into the hangar, the building yesterday, and he had his cowboy hat in his hand, and he did the whole acting charade thing that Bush loves to do as well.
[02:48:12.971 --> 02:48:15.832]  We've got to recognize that, especially in the South.
[02:48:15.872 --> 02:48:17.433]  They're using that so often.
[02:48:17.973 --> 02:48:24.037]  It's just this thing to work on our emotions as Texans or people from the South, and we've got to stop.
[02:48:24.337 --> 02:48:24.737]  It's awful.
[02:48:26.986 --> 02:48:27.607]  They always do.
[02:48:27.667 --> 02:48:31.149]  How you doing, partner?
[02:48:31.169 --> 02:48:33.211]  I'm a good old boy.
[02:48:33.291 --> 02:48:34.272]  You can trust me.
[02:48:35.012 --> 02:48:37.174]  Well, I commend you for what you did.
[02:48:37.254 --> 02:48:39.596]  I want to come back with one or two final questions for you.
[02:48:39.936 --> 02:48:42.839]  Don't forget, I'll be back on the radio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:42.879 --> 02:48:43.199]  Central.
[02:48:48.895 --> 02:48:54.340]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.700 --> 02:49:02.346]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.044 --> 02:49:10.087]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.487 --> 02:49:21.932]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.212 --> 02:49:25.894]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.194 --> 02:49:28.155]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.455 --> 02:49:32.297]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:08.454 --> 02:50:17.798]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:18.058 --> 02:50:21.560]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:52:03.291 --> 02:52:05.775]  Before we end this transmission, we're going back to our guest here in a moment.
[02:52:05.795 --> 02:52:08.839]  I want to tell you about Solutions from Science in Thomas, Illinois.
[02:52:08.859 --> 02:52:11.223]  They've got a deal that ends in just three days.
[02:52:11.904 --> 02:52:16.430]  Three months supply of shellacene, an incredible 84 different types of minerals in ionic form.
[02:52:17.712 --> 02:52:19.475]  The best mineral supplement out there we've found.

[02:52:42.007 --> 02:52:43.927]  Depression, nuclear war, you never know.
[02:52:44.027 --> 02:52:46.008]  I don't think that stuff's... I hope it isn't going to happen.
[02:52:46.588 --> 02:52:56.413]  The nuclear war thing I hope doesn't happen, or A-bombs going off as Dick Cheney has said will happen, but I know this depression stuff's looming when the XM Bank and others are saying it, and the International Bank of Settlements.
[02:52:56.673 --> 02:52:58.314]  Regardless, I got my storable food.
[02:52:58.774 --> 02:52:59.494]  I got lots of it.
[02:52:59.995 --> 02:53:03.196]  And people say, my family, don't tell people that.
[02:53:03.696 --> 02:53:04.977]  Well, I got stuff to protect it, too.
[02:53:05.898 --> 02:53:07.578]  Firearms and stuff that unravels.
[02:53:07.898 --> 02:53:09.759]  The point is, give Eat Food's direct a call.
[02:53:09.779 --> 02:53:10.360]  Get prepared.
[02:53:10.380 --> 02:53:14.202]  They're the oldest, longest, continual operating storable food company in the nation.

[02:53:29.653 --> 02:53:32.734]  Just in closing, Jessica Wilson, anything else you'd like to add?
[02:53:33.355 --> 02:53:34.736]  How did it end with the police?
[02:53:34.856 --> 02:53:35.416]  What happened?
[02:53:35.496 --> 02:53:39.078]  And I wish you a very good weekend.
[02:53:40.097 --> 02:53:40.597]  Well, thank you.
[02:53:40.857 --> 02:53:51.660]  Yeah, we were escorted outside around the corner, and as we were turning the corner, Fred Thompson was actually going out that same door, outside the gate, and... Did you yell at his lordship again?
[02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:53.161]  Oh, yes, I did.
[02:53:54.021 --> 02:54:07.185]  It didn't stop there, but the police told me to stop, because if I went any further, I would be going back closer to him, and so he drove off, and then the police continued to hold on to me and escorted me off the property.
[02:54:08.772 --> 02:54:16.615]  All because you politely asked a question, and then were grabbed by one of his minions, and then he went and told the police something on you, and this happens everywhere.
[02:54:17.255 --> 02:54:21.957]  They're just, listen ma'am, America ain't American no more, do you understand us?
[02:54:22.177 --> 02:54:24.178]  We don't like you asking those questions.
[02:54:24.898 --> 02:54:30.340]  Yeah, it was so absurd, and all the- the whole time as I was being escorted, the press that was following me was asking me,
[02:54:30.902 --> 02:54:33.964]  questions about the CFR and who I was with, etc.
[02:54:34.044 --> 02:54:41.067]  and I can't believe that... Well, remember, in Canada next month, 18 miles around in a major town, no one is allowed in.
[02:54:41.087 --> 02:54:43.569]  I mean, is this freedom?
[02:54:43.589 --> 02:54:46.891]  And it's the CFR sponsoring it!
[02:54:47.891 --> 02:54:49.152]  But you're not supposed to ask about it!
[02:54:49.732 --> 02:54:56.976]  His aide sure knew to send you to the who's cow over at the... Yep, it's pretty ridiculous.
[02:54:57.529 --> 02:55:00.250]  Well, this is the illustration of the land of the free and home of the brave.
[02:55:00.290 --> 02:55:01.290]  Let's keep it that way.
[02:55:01.330 --> 02:55:03.390]  It's the land of the chicken-necked cowards.
[02:55:03.630 --> 02:55:08.271]  Tell us about the website and organization and how folks can team up with you to help you fight the New World Order.
[02:55:08.891 --> 02:55:12.832]  We have houston911truth.org and then there's also a meetup group.
[02:55:12.912 --> 02:55:22.214]  If you go to meetup.com and you search Houston 9-11 Truth, we have a very large group, over 100 people in Houston that are involved with this.
[02:55:22.374 --> 02:55:24.374]  So please, we need all the help we can get.
[02:55:24.781 --> 02:55:28.862]  I had one other person with me that day, and he was detained before I was pulled out of the group.
[02:55:28.962 --> 02:55:32.143]  And the more people we have, they're asking questions, the better.
[02:55:32.283 --> 02:55:33.563]  See, this is the freedom now.
[02:55:33.623 --> 02:55:37.224]  You go to a press conference, and there's people being detained.
[02:55:37.584 --> 02:55:41.406]  And now we're going to have Stasi, political police, ABC News.
[02:55:41.746 --> 02:55:42.486]  I mean, come on.
[02:55:42.506 --> 02:55:43.226]  They're crooks.
[02:55:43.566 --> 02:55:44.746]  They're going for broke.
[02:55:44.946 --> 02:55:46.327]  They're destroying the country.
[02:55:46.827 --> 02:55:48.407]  Military, police, government.
[02:55:48.467 --> 02:55:49.008]  Come on.
[02:55:49.368 --> 02:55:50.208]  Choose sides.
[02:55:50.228 --> 02:55:52.929]  Decide if you're with America or the New World Order.
[02:55:53.729 --> 02:55:54.129]  Jessica?
[02:55:54.941 --> 02:56:00.423]  If they're afraid of a little blonde-haired girl, and think you're Al-Qaeda, we're in trouble.
[02:56:00.583 --> 02:56:04.084]  But they should be afraid of it, because you're out there taking action, and I commend you.
[02:56:04.364 --> 02:56:05.425]  And good job.
[02:56:05.665 --> 02:56:06.865]  Your action's bearing fruit.
[02:56:07.606 --> 02:56:08.186]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:08.646 --> 02:56:09.046]  You bet.
[02:56:09.086 --> 02:56:09.586]  Take care.
[02:56:09.686 --> 02:56:10.107]  All right.
[02:56:10.207 --> 02:56:11.407]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:11.747 --> 02:56:15.929]  We retransmit 21 hours after each show on the Internet, restreaming.
[02:56:15.969 --> 02:56:18.690]  And you can download it for free at the podcast at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:18.990 --> 02:56:19.870]  God bless you all.
[02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:22.251]  Have a great weekend, and destroy the New World Order!
