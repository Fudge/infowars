[00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:06.170]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.832 --> 00:00:07.894]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:09.739]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.182]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:12.725]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.482]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:21.786]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:41.957]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.218 --> 00:00:42.678]  Welcome.
[00:00:42.738 --> 00:00:44.439]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.161]  It is the 12th day of February, 2007.
[00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:52.546]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.606 --> 00:01:02.494]  We have Webster Griffin Tarpley joining us in the third hour to discuss the upcoming attack that is literally imminent on Iran.
[00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:08.719]  All the preparations have been made by the Global Crime Syndicate, Russia's response, and much more.
[00:01:09.648 --> 00:01:10.388]  In the third hour.
[00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:22.371]  And for the next two hours, often on the week, we'll be covering news detailing this central subject and covering many other news topics and issues, as well as taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:25.532]  I have quite a stack of police state news here before me today.
[00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:28.272]  They've brought 500 talking urinals in the state of New Mexico.
[00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:44.345]  These little devices telling you when you go to the bathroom to not drink and drive.
[00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:49.073]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, talk about Orwell, talk about telescreens.
[00:01:49.113 --> 00:01:50.916]  They didn't have talking toilets in 1984.
[00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:51.757]  Only in America.
[00:01:55.428 --> 00:02:10.201]  And a German flying through an airport, going through the x-ray machines, didn't like what was happening, so he went ahead and just stripped down naked, or took his pants off, it's not clear, and so they arrested him and are charging him with a bunch of things.
[00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:18.007]  And all over the world, the Western world, they're putting in these x-ray machines that scan and record an image of your naked body.
[00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:23.412]  Again, talking toilets, cameras in the bathrooms, scanning your naked body,
[00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:33.419]  Putting you through high-powered x-rays that shoot through metal at the border when you're leaving, of course not when you're coming in, all part of the ultra-big-brother grid.
[00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:45.406]  They're announcing that major airlines are planning to put cameras in the back of every seat, watching and scanning your eye movement, your facial expressions, with AI computer software tracking you.
[00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:46.987]  It's just...
[00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:48.831]  It's all off the charts.
[00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:58.315]  Again, Google has announced they're going to use the cameras and microphones that are built into all the new computers, and most of the old ones to watch and listen to you and have computers log everything you say.
[00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:02.656]  It's just openly announced, just total wall-to-wall insanity.
[00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:13.480]  The governor of Texas publicly on the Merck payroll is running around saying it's the law, you've got to take a live cancer virus, and there is no law.
[00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.342]  They're openly preparing to start World War III.
[00:03:17.402 --> 00:03:21.564]  They're openly preparing to pass the blanket total amnesty as the guest worker program.
[00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:23.605]  We're openly going into the North American Union.
[00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:25.906]  It's just out of control.
[00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:29.148]  I thought I printed it last night.
[00:03:29.168 --> 00:03:35.591]  I was reading emails last night trying to go through literally thousands of them and navigate all the spam for the hundreds of good emails.
[00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:45.760]  And it wasn't in my stack when I stapled them this morning, but to paraphrase, I got an email saying, You're a liar!
[00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:52.405]  I saw a website saying you're making it up about Rick Perry being on the payroll of Merc.
[00:03:53.446 --> 00:03:55.007]  And I demand you prove it.
[00:03:55.448 --> 00:03:57.169]  Well, I demand you do some research!
[00:03:58.527 --> 00:04:06.073]  It was in four or five AP articles we covered last week, and I detail the articles, and later in the week I mentioned those articles.
[00:04:06.773 --> 00:04:24.686]  It was in every news article I saw that his former chief of staff is a Merck employee, that Perry took record contributions from Merck, that the different state reps that are pushing it are on the Merck payroll, and it was just all over the news.
[00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:28.079]  But no, I'm making it up again.
[00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.864]  It's just been all over national and international and local Texas news.
[00:04:34.344 --> 00:04:35.586]  I sit here in the Capitol.
[00:04:36.707 --> 00:04:39.829]  Oh no, there's no North American Union.
[00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.412]  There's no lobbying going on.
[00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:51.140]  There's just, it's all... I mean, when people are denying basic stuff, it's just, it's mind-boggling.
[00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:54.367]  All right, we'll come back, plunge you into just tons of news.
[00:04:54.687 --> 00:04:58.948]  PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, or just some of the websites.
[00:04:58.968 --> 00:05:07.630]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.910]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:17.892]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:25.667]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:37.512]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:41.234]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.695]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:47.877]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:07.453]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.673 --> 00:07:09.434]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.694 --> 00:07:15.976]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:16.277 --> 00:07:22.399]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.480]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.441]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:47.800]  We're good to go.
[00:08:05.646 --> 00:08:06.307]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.967 --> 00:08:08.028]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:09.849]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:11.310]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.951]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:17.574]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.814 --> 00:08:21.896]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.006 --> 00:08:39.027]  All right, eight minutes, 30 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:50.491]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, as I said earlier, is joining us in the third hour to talk about all the big build-up towards the kickoff of what could develop into World War III with Iran.
[00:08:51.891 --> 00:09:03.435]  In fact, here in just a few minutes, I'm going to be breaking down the new hype, the new propaganda claiming that Iran is trying to deliver conventional plastic explosives
[00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:32.826]  devices or materials to Iraq to quote attack coalition forces and as I mentioned earlier talking urinal telescreens that's here in the US angry German tourist got pants at airport x-ray they're going to have cameras built in as I mentioned into the airline passenger seats the seat a few inches in front of your face scanning your face looking for signs of terrorism
[00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:37.904]  I mean, this would be comical if it wasn't so serious.
[00:09:37.984 --> 00:09:41.392]  Brain scanners on the street corners from New York to London.
[00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:43.083]  It's all happening.
[00:09:43.623 --> 00:09:46.105]  It's all being put in place right now.
[00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:48.506]  Bush's uncle is in trouble.
[00:09:48.686 --> 00:10:01.435]  If you go just type in Bush crime family or Bush crime family family tree, you'll see a bunch of different websites that list all the arrests and indictments and criminal investigations on the entire family.
[00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:04.697]  I mean, there's no one who hasn't been involved in massive crime.
[00:10:05.713 --> 00:10:07.455]  It truly is a crime family.
[00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:18.585]  And I mean, just right down to robbery, to prescription drug fraud, to drug dealing, to SNL scamming, there's nothing these people aren't involved in.
[00:10:19.205 --> 00:10:21.027]  It's a family tradition.
[00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:23.048]  It's a family operation.
[00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.094]  And we'll be going over that from the LA Times a little bit later as well.
[00:10:30.319 --> 00:10:39.426]  I promise to spend more time today on all the different whistleblowers, firemen, police, EMT workers, eyewitnesses, newscasts.
[00:10:40.507 --> 00:10:42.949]  There's just so much audio, so many clips.
[00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:58.642]  I did spend a few hours this weekend trying to go through all of it, and I sent several hours of audio clips this morning to John, who's trying to record and grab up the web to play some of those in the third hour concerning...
[00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:12.609]  All the eyewitnesses that discuss hearing bombs, seeing bombs going off, being told to get back from Building 7 that the government was ordering it demolished, pulled, brought down, they're going to blow up the building, get back, we're bringing the building down.
[00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:14.250]  On and on and on.
[00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.392]  Police on video, firemen on video, emergency workers.
[00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:20.452]  We're good to go.
[00:11:31.676 --> 00:11:35.217]  And we interviewed him, and I forgot a few other cameras were in the room when I did interview him.
[00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:36.218]  They said, can we come along?
[00:11:36.258 --> 00:11:41.860]  And here came one of the videos popping up on the web where I'd interviewed him.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.422]  And we were planning to put that in another 9-11 film that we were going to make after this new film I'm making on the world government.
[00:11:50.303 --> 00:11:51.643]  And I went, oh, I remember that.
[00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:53.024]  I remember doing that interview.
[00:11:54.084 --> 00:11:55.665]  Once I saw it pop up on the web.
[00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:59.086]  It's posted in the story Paul put up on Saturday.
[00:12:00.612 --> 00:12:00.972]  We're good to go.
[00:12:00.992 --> 00:12:01.472]  We're good to go.
[00:12:28.843 --> 00:12:33.307]  And a bunch of other... Because literally, we shot over 100 hours in New York.
[00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:35.689]  I've been saying 90.
[00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:39.332]  We've now chronicled and dumped it all onto the computer.
[00:12:39.372 --> 00:12:39.793]  It's over 100.
[00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:42.015]  And there's just so many.
[00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:47.780]  I'm wallowing in video I got myself.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.663]  Not just all the other news clips and clips other people have gotten.
[00:12:53.004 --> 00:12:53.725]  And sure enough...
[00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:57.549]  Bombs going off.
[00:12:57.609 --> 00:12:59.390]  Everybody talking about how bombs are going off.
[00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.611]  Everybody talking about the police and firemen and EMTs all talking about how they were told to get back.
[00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:05.492]  They were going to bring down Building 7.
[00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:10.333]  So that's coming up in the third hour.
[00:13:13.054 --> 00:13:15.194]  Right now, let's get into what's happening with Iran.
[00:13:16.135 --> 00:13:20.576]  This is a big subject, but this is what it comes down to.
[00:13:22.045 --> 00:13:35.170]  The White House, we now have a White House memo confirmed by the White House to be authentic, where Bush is talking to Blair about staging WMD discoveries, about having informants defectors come out and claim they fraudulently saw WMDs.
[00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.471]  It's the same crowd that told you about uranium from Niger.
[00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:41.492]  It's the same people that told you about aluminum tubes.
[00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:49.118]  It's the same crowd who told us that the troops would be out of Iraq in just six months.
[00:13:49.158 --> 00:13:51.259]  They'd be back in time for Christmas.
[00:13:51.859 --> 00:13:54.541]  And now they've been there coming up on four years in March.
[00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:58.383]  It's about to be four years in just a couple months.
[00:13:58.523 --> 00:14:01.065]  Some of the troops starting their fourth tour.
[00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:05.267]  I guess they started their fourth tour six, seven months ago.
[00:14:05.287 --> 00:14:08.289]  So now they're going to be starting their fifth tour soon.
[00:14:08.729 --> 00:14:11.231]  This is just off the charts amazing.
[00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:17.211]  And of course, the White House and Pentagon and Israeli and British documents have all been made public.
[00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:24.353]  And it's been in the news that, no, they plan to build all these permanent bases and be there at least for 30 years to basically never leave for all intents and purposes.
[00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:27.214]  But they lied again and told us that that wasn't the case.
[00:14:27.574 --> 00:14:32.016]  Remember, we have a White House that's been caught buying billions of dollars of fake news.
[00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:36.237]  Billions and billions and billions of dollars in fake news.
[00:14:36.617 --> 00:14:40.138]  In fact, there's a big article in one of the big British papers today
[00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:41.951]  We're good to go.
[00:14:56.767 --> 00:14:57.748]  We're good to go.
[00:15:14.318 --> 00:15:15.799]  But it still continues.
[00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:22.364]  I mean, they admit that CENTCOM has thousands of people out there posing and blogging and putting out propaganda.
[00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:29.510]  It's illegal to have the military covertly running around engaging in psyops against the American people.
[00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:38.497]  So my point with Iran is we have certified liars, certified propagandists,
[00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:44.793]  Gearing up and preparing the ground for another invasion of Iran.
[00:15:45.113 --> 00:15:59.659]  Now, remember, Cy Hirsch, two and a half years ago, at the New Yorker magazine, reported, and it was since confirmed, that there have been special forces troops in Iran, U.S.
[00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:03.961]  forces and British forces, for upwards of three years.
[00:16:05.498 --> 00:16:07.280]  There have been dams being bombed.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.101]  There have been truck bombs going off.
[00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:11.063]  People have been getting assassinated.
[00:16:12.164 --> 00:16:14.306]  Special forces are in the mountains and the hills.
[00:16:14.346 --> 00:16:21.492]  They're lazing and marking and getting ground intelligence and directing satellite photography and preparing the targets to be hit.
[00:16:22.092 --> 00:16:26.176]  There is no doubt that the globalist military, it's no longer our military.
[00:16:26.376 --> 00:16:27.257]  Let's get that straight.
[00:16:27.317 --> 00:16:33.122]  It belongs to the private corporations that overthrew our government in the hostile takeover that is now complete.
[00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:39.354]  They are there actually attacking and running military operations against Iran.
[00:16:41.415 --> 00:16:54.160]  And then the neocons have the nerve to use the very same New York Times writer who claimed yellow cake and claimed aluminum tubes, and an editor and publisher reported on this over the weekend.
[00:16:55.911 --> 00:17:15.767]  To now claim that Iran clearly gave mortar shells, which are then converted into landmines to destroy British, U.S., and Iraqi National Guard convoys, as well as the private mercenary truckers.
[00:17:18.582 --> 00:17:23.747]  Now, frankly, I have no doubt that Iran probably is involved.
[00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:30.554]  There is a little bit of evidence that they're at least trying to guide some of the insurgency in the fight between the Shiites and the Sunnis.
[00:17:31.294 --> 00:17:32.435]  There's no doubt of that.
[00:17:35.458 --> 00:17:36.679]  There's definitely no doubt.
[00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:40.403]  And they'd be crazy if they weren't trying to project...
[00:17:41.537 --> 00:18:00.594]  ...their power into that region because the official Pentagon plan is to break Iraq into three parts and then focus military force and revolution into the west of Iran, out of the east of Iraq, which our own government admits they have hired all these spies and people to destabilize the western area.
[00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:07.621]  But British colonels and generals as well as American colonels are on record that they are patrolling and scanning the entire
[00:18:08.528 --> 00:18:09.409]  We're good to go.
[00:18:30.928 --> 00:18:38.350]  The globalists have already infiltrated and are denying the Iranians even control of many of the border regions.
[00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.910]  So let's get that straight.
[00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:44.251]  The Iranians are not shipping anything through that area.
[00:18:45.512 --> 00:18:47.432]  Did Iranians get it in some other way?
[00:18:47.492 --> 00:18:48.993]  Are Iranians smuggling in another way?
[00:18:49.353 --> 00:18:50.093]  Are Iranians...
[00:18:51.812 --> 00:18:53.713]  Did they get it in previous to the invasion?
[00:18:53.753 --> 00:18:55.094]  That certainly could be happening.
[00:18:55.414 --> 00:19:03.780]  But the point is, to hear that there's all these cross-border incursions and convoys of explosives being shipped across is a fraud.
[00:19:04.721 --> 00:19:18.350]  And the same people that are telling us this now, four years ago, told us that Iraq had WMDs and was involved in all this, and are the same ones that fraudulently claim that the WMDs were shipped into Syria.
[00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:32.342]  This is military psyops, as the chief war college expert at the Naval War College has said on C-SPAN, the military works for Madison Avenue and the big banks and Wall Street.
[00:19:34.102 --> 00:19:34.903]  Globalization.
[00:19:35.603 --> 00:19:41.945]  And so when you hear our military, now a large portion of it foreign merc troops from Latin America predominantly,
[00:19:43.363 --> 00:19:49.531]  Understand that they're waging war against us, they're waging war against the Iraqis, they're waging war against the Iranians.
[00:19:49.952 --> 00:19:55.960]  We'll break this down in some detail on the other side as they prepare to kick off World War III.
[00:19:57.615 --> 00:20:02.577]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[00:20:02.877 --> 00:20:08.319]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:12.641]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:20:12.981 --> 00:20:16.002]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:20:16.323 --> 00:20:19.744]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:20:20.084 --> 00:20:29.430]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkeys patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.192]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:40.537]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:20:40.777 --> 00:20:42.158]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[00:20:58.653 --> 00:21:00.976]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:21:01.296 --> 00:21:02.297]  The real money folks.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.521]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:08.881]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:09.542]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:09.962]  A 5% increase.
[00:21:09.982 --> 00:21:12.403]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[00:21:12.423 --> 00:21:14.304]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:21:14.324 --> 00:21:15.784]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[00:21:15.804 --> 00:21:17.285]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:33.086 --> 00:21:36.107]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:21:36.668 --> 00:21:41.810]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:43.111 --> 00:21:47.112]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:21:47.733 --> 00:21:50.654]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:21:51.114 --> 00:21:52.515]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.683]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:01.343 --> 00:22:09.431]  Did you know that Senate committee investigations in the 1960s called the international communist movement the greatest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed?
[00:22:10.312 --> 00:22:17.579]  They said the communists had infiltrated into high government offices in the State Department and also advisors to presidents.
[00:22:18.353 --> 00:22:18.733]  1-800-516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736
[00:22:45.535 --> 00:22:50.703]  516-8736 to request your subscription.
[00:22:51.324 --> 00:22:51.965]  Call now.

[00:22:58.044 --> 00:23:00.085]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:00.705 --> 00:23:09.627]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:17.269]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:18.015 --> 00:23:23.501]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lacemed Ink's patented methodology.
[00:23:23.981 --> 00:23:34.832]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:35.573 --> 00:23:37.595]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:38.135 --> 00:23:41.296]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com Call 702-953-0267
[00:24:09.446 --> 00:24:12.068]  During the break, I did get the article I mentioned earlier.
[00:24:12.108 --> 00:24:13.189]  This is the London Times.
[00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:47.015]  From December 31st, when the change becomes law in the UK, they can be named and shamed by trading standards or taken to court.
[00:24:49.176 --> 00:24:54.019]  Sounds reasonable, but again, you can't trust government to do that because government is the main body doing this.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:05.665]  When private companies, whether it's Frito-Lay or Budweiser or Ford or Toyota, and they all do it, one of the biggest forms of advertising...
[00:25:06.622 --> 00:25:12.266]  Go out into TV shows, or go out... In fact, because of the channel changers what drove this.
[00:25:13.127 --> 00:25:15.188]  The channel changer developed in the 70s.
[00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:17.069]  By the 80s, revolutionized things.
[00:25:17.089 --> 00:25:21.473]  People stopped, and now basically completely stopped, watching commercials.
[00:25:23.194 --> 00:25:24.535]  And people switch around.
[00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:27.337]  And so they started product placement.
[00:25:28.558 --> 00:25:28.878]  Where...
[00:25:30.285 --> 00:25:31.486]  I'm sure you all know about this.
[00:25:31.506 --> 00:25:35.427]  I never watched the show, but I read about it.
[00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:37.748]  The Apprentice with Donald Trump.
[00:25:38.349 --> 00:25:44.551]  They had like a $37 million contract in one season for an airline.
[00:25:45.412 --> 00:25:52.014]  And they would work into the script of what was said on the reality show three or four times a program, the press reported.
[00:25:52.034 --> 00:25:57.857]  I guess some of you must have watched it and noticed it, to talk about, what was it, Virgin Atlantic Airlines?
[00:26:00.603 --> 00:26:02.183]  So this is how they operate.
[00:26:03.244 --> 00:26:04.404]  And that's fine and dandy.
[00:26:05.204 --> 00:26:08.605]  Okay, I mean, I think it ruins a lot of TV programs and movies.
[00:26:09.306 --> 00:26:14.747]  But they have like Wayne's World 2, where the entire movie is just one product placement after the next.
[00:26:16.968 --> 00:26:18.908]  But there's something even bigger.
[00:26:19.529 --> 00:26:21.809]  And most people are still not aware of it.
[00:26:21.849 --> 00:26:27.571]  And I have coined the term, I guess about nine years ago, propaganda placement.
[00:26:29.128 --> 00:26:38.976]  And Bill Clinton really accelerated it in 1996, and that's when we first started discovering it, billions of dollars in fake news.
[00:26:40.337 --> 00:26:49.965]  ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, being paid by the Justice Department, being paid by the Labor Department, to actually include things in scripts.
[00:26:51.286 --> 00:26:55.329]  When you watch 24 and they're torturing children to get answers out of their parents,
[00:26:56.056 --> 00:27:01.398]  And then you read actual memos written a year, two years before by the White House ordering that?
[00:27:02.778 --> 00:27:05.159]  It's not a coincidence, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:07.339]  They're paying for that.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.500]  Fox is one of the most highly paid.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.242]  Fox Television and Fox News and the News Corp Corporation gets massive money from the government.
[00:27:17.522 --> 00:27:21.083]  They have Viet Dinh who wrote the Patriot Act on their board of directors.
[00:27:21.123 --> 00:27:22.544]  Go read who's on their board of directors.
[00:27:23.624 --> 00:27:27.745]  And Roger Ailes, helping basically run Hillary for Senate campaign.
[00:27:28.805 --> 00:27:30.166]  The guy behind Rush Limbaugh.
[00:27:30.606 --> 00:27:31.386]  It's a joke.
[00:27:31.446 --> 00:27:32.506]  They play golf together.
[00:27:32.546 --> 00:27:33.607]  They vacation together.
[00:27:34.127 --> 00:27:36.307]  They sit around laughing at us.
[00:27:36.787 --> 00:27:40.448]  It is totally and completely staged.
[00:27:40.548 --> 00:27:46.890]  Now, just in war propaganda, $1.6 billion was spent in two years.
[00:27:47.757 --> 00:27:55.541]  We don't know the numbers because we've got a few of the reporters here and there on other issues, like No Child Left Behind.
[00:27:55.601 --> 00:27:58.442]  We know that it was in the tens of millions.
[00:27:59.002 --> 00:28:06.606]  But again, the media, when they had to report on it, minimized it to just Armstrong, Williams, and a handful of other reporters.
[00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:07.406]  Oh, he got 244,000.
[00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:09.447]  Remember?
[00:28:10.407 --> 00:28:13.909]  The Associated Press reported about a year and a half ago.
[00:28:13.989 --> 00:28:16.250]  Remember Tommy Franks was in Baghdad for four months?
[00:28:18.809 --> 00:28:20.209]  He then announced he was retiring.
[00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.030]  And I've got this on tape.
[00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.631]  We've taped, we just don't have any way to even access it all.
[00:28:24.651 --> 00:28:26.151]  We tape it all, we don't have big enough staff.
[00:28:26.531 --> 00:28:28.272]  But it was on, remember Tommy Franks?
[00:28:29.152 --> 00:28:29.932]  We played the clips here.
[00:28:30.452 --> 00:28:31.293]  The clips are online.
[00:28:32.653 --> 00:28:40.575]  Where he'd go on Fox and go, well, gee, let me just make it clear, I'm non-partisan, I'm not a Republican or a Democrat, I'm a private person now.
[00:28:41.716 --> 00:28:43.256]  These are exact words.
[00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:47.343]  But it's just really going to be sad, but the people demand it.
[00:28:47.443 --> 00:28:50.546]  One more big attack, we go into martial law, military form of government.
[00:28:51.126 --> 00:28:52.027]  It's what the people want.
[00:28:53.388 --> 00:28:54.169]  So he's preparing.
[00:28:54.749 --> 00:28:56.991]  And I said, that guy's on the payroll, there's no doubt.
[00:28:57.411 --> 00:29:00.093]  And then it came out, $500,000 was $550-something thousand.
[00:29:05.635 --> 00:29:14.021]  Just type into Google, Tommy Frank's still on Pentagon payroll secretly to push war.
[00:29:14.361 --> 00:29:15.842]  I think there were several headlines.
[00:29:17.203 --> 00:29:18.024]  And you can pull it up.
[00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:31.694]  So, again, lying and saying, I'm just saying this because I personally believe it, and he's on the payroll of the Pentagon in a secret operation.
[00:29:32.777 --> 00:29:35.580]  Folks, thousands and thousands of them are.
[00:29:37.161 --> 00:29:41.626]  But the media tells you about hotels doing it and restaurants doing it.
[00:29:42.246 --> 00:29:44.308]  Of course they do, but so does the government.
[00:29:44.569 --> 00:29:46.390]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.251 --> 00:29:48.172]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.633 --> 00:29:50.234]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.175 --> 00:29:53.838]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:57.668 --> 00:29:59.349]  Government is best which governs least.
[00:29:59.529 --> 00:30:00.790]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.852]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:04.212 --> 00:30:06.974]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:14.258]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:30:56.644 --> 00:31:01.589]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:03.791]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:31:03.971 --> 00:31:07.034]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:31:07.214 --> 00:31:10.357]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:31:10.657 --> 00:31:12.499]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:16.464]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:31:16.745 --> 00:31:19.409]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:31:19.429 --> 00:31:24.355]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:31:24.536 --> 00:31:28.782]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:31:29.202 --> 00:31:33.545]  The Bible says we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the Unholy Alliance.
[00:31:33.866 --> 00:31:38.109]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.

[00:31:48.537 --> 00:31:49.457]  And ask for Packet B.
[00:31:57.757 --> 00:32:03.700]  Imagine, a firefly, simple and innocent, the ability to light the night sky.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:08.642]  The ozone layer, unseen by the naked eye, life-sustaining.
[00:32:09.382 --> 00:32:12.303]  Our ocean, primordial soup, breathes life.

[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.182]  Hi, I'm Isabella, founder of Soleil Wellness.
[00:32:47.282 --> 00:32:48.482]  Visit us or call 866-497-0274.
[00:32:48.502 --> 00:32:49.143]  866-497-0274.
[00:32:49.223 --> 00:32:50.823]  We don't need no education.
[00:33:06.902 --> 00:33:16.588]  Alright callers, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:16.708 --> 00:33:20.191]  Let me get back into Iran, though.
[00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:23.993]  I got sidetracked on propaganda placement, government propaganda news.
[00:33:25.954 --> 00:33:31.478]  And I really should separate propaganda placement, which the government admits they're doing...
[00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:44.204]  Which is billions and billions a year versus the billions spent on completely fake news through reporters that are really on different federal and even state agency payrolls.
[00:33:47.706 --> 00:33:52.009]  It's just off the charts amazing that this is going on.
[00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:55.931]  Now we have target Tehran, target Iran.
[00:33:56.011 --> 00:34:00.093]  Washington sets the stage for a new confrontation.
[00:34:01.582 --> 00:34:11.709]  London Independent, the United States is moving closer to war with Iran by accusing the highest levels of the Iranian government of supplying sophisticated roadside bombs that have killed 170 U.S.
[00:34:11.729 --> 00:34:12.450]  troops and wounded 620.
[00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:19.175]  The allegations against Iran are similar in tone and credibility to those made four years ago by the U.S.
[00:34:19.215 --> 00:34:24.078]  government about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction in order to justify the invasion of 2003.
[00:34:24.118 --> 00:34:24.979]  It's now 2007, almost four years.
[00:34:28.428 --> 00:34:29.129]  Senior U.S.
[00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:48.691]  defense officials in Baghdad, speaking on the condition of anonymity, of course, you can't prove it, said they believed, again, speaking secretly said they believed, they're secretly not even saying they're sure, that the bombs were manufactured in Iran and smuggled across the border to Shia militants in Iraq.
[00:34:49.309 --> 00:34:58.195]  The weapons, identified as explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs, are said to be capable of destroying an Abrams tank.
[00:34:58.235 --> 00:34:58.915]  Now, what are they?
[00:34:58.935 --> 00:35:01.197]  They've released a photo.
[00:35:01.397 --> 00:35:03.258]  It is a mortar shell.
[00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:05.379]  You know how easy it is?
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.802]  Iran sells conventional weapons all over the world.
[00:35:08.962 --> 00:35:10.082]  Every major government does.
[00:35:10.503 --> 00:35:12.884]  How easy it is to go buy some Iranian shells?
[00:35:13.264 --> 00:35:16.887]  I have no doubt that militants haven't gotten a hold of these weapons.
[00:35:18.323 --> 00:35:21.726]  I mean, our so-called government sells landmines to hundreds of countries.
[00:35:21.827 --> 00:35:22.267]  Allows it.
[00:35:22.707 --> 00:35:25.170]  And in missiles and jets and helicopters.
[00:35:26.011 --> 00:35:27.392]  But, oh, gotta go to war!
[00:35:27.532 --> 00:35:28.053]  That's it!
[00:35:28.653 --> 00:35:30.315]  They found some mortars.
[00:35:30.395 --> 00:35:35.740]  But then the mortars appear to not even be of Iranian manufacture.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.963]  And Kurt Nemo has reported on this up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:41.002 --> 00:35:42.203]  And there is the photo.
[00:35:42.243 --> 00:35:49.569]  The photo above supposedly demonstrates the Pentagon has seized a number of 81mm mortar rounds used as roadside bombs.
[00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:55.713]  These bombs, quote, are specially designed to penetrate heavy armor, military vehicles, and are capable of crippling the U.S.
[00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:58.436]  Army's main battle tank, the Abrams M1.
[00:35:58.696 --> 00:36:05.241]  The Telegraph ominously reports, or rather reads, that from a Pentagon script, they have killed 170 U.S.
[00:36:06.021 --> 00:36:06.282]  troops.
[00:36:06.302 --> 00:36:10.565]  And that's all the media is doing, is reporting this, and then you look at it,
[00:36:12.268 --> 00:36:28.716]  And it is, it says in English, 81mm, and it says 3-2006, but then you go look at real Iranian borders, and it's in Arabic, and it is on the Muslim calendar.
[00:36:30.157 --> 00:36:33.699]  Not even saying that we're in the same millennium.
[00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:38.381]  So, just shoddily done as usual.
[00:36:39.642 --> 00:36:40.342]  But let's be clear.
[00:36:40.522 --> 00:36:46.465]  I don't doubt, and we know that Iran is funding some of the Shias and is trying to dominate Iraq.
[00:36:46.485 --> 00:36:52.508]  I mean, after all, they had an eight-year war with Iraq, which was financed by the United States.
[00:36:53.148 --> 00:36:59.711]  Over a million and a half dead Iranians, over, what, 400-plus thousand dead Iraqis during that war.
[00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:04.493]  So the same people that lied to us in the past are lying to us again today.
[00:37:05.695 --> 00:37:11.279]  New York Times reporter who got Iraq WMDs wrong now highlights Iran claims.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.541]  This out of editor and publisher New York.
[00:37:13.941 --> 00:37:24.769]  Saturday's New York Times features an article posted at the top of its website late Friday that suggests very strongly that Iran is supplying the deadliest weapon aimed at American troops in Iraq.
[00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:33.416]  The author notes any assertion of an Iranian contribution to attacks on America in Iraq is both politically and diplomatically volatile.
[00:37:34.276 --> 00:37:34.857]  It goes on.
[00:37:35.749 --> 00:37:38.171]  What is the source of this volatile information?
[00:37:38.691 --> 00:37:45.315]  Nothing less than civilian and military officials from a broad range of government agencies, close quote.
[00:37:45.735 --> 00:37:46.836]  Sound pretty convincing?
[00:37:46.856 --> 00:37:49.918]  Well, almost all the sources in the story are unnamed.
[00:37:50.298 --> 00:37:57.203]  It is also maybe worth noting that the author is Michael R. Gordon, the same Times reporter who, on his own...
[00:37:58.425 --> 00:37:58.925]  We're good to go.
[00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:30.766]  Eighth 2002 aluminum tube story that proved so influential, especially since the administration trumpeted it on television talk shows.
[00:38:33.067 --> 00:38:35.227]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:38:35.247 --> 00:38:44.749]  When the Times eventually carried an editor's note that admitted some of its Iraq coverage was wrong and or overblown, it criticized
[00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:54.813]  Two people, Miller and Gordon, stories, and noted that the September 8, 2002 article on page one of the newspaper gave the first detailed account of the aluminum tubes.
[00:38:55.173 --> 00:39:06.657]  The article cited an unidentified senior administration official who insisted that the dimensions, specifications, and numbers of tubes sought showed that they were intended for a nuclear weapons program.
[00:39:06.957 --> 00:39:09.538]  This, of course, proved to be completely bogus.
[00:39:11.371 --> 00:39:14.412]  So we're going to put a detailed article together concerning this.
[00:39:14.492 --> 00:39:26.677]  But bottom line, we have two major carrier task force groups and then two sub-carrier groups, two of the smaller carrier groups, in place.
[00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:38.381]  That is the Marine Corps type amphibious floating cities that launch the hovercraft and carrier jump jets and sea cobras and the rest of it.
[00:39:39.702 --> 00:39:43.986]  Along with two other task forces that are in support of it.
[00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:48.210]  So if you put it all together, it's six naval flotillas.
[00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:54.776]  Submarines, you name it, now there in the Persian Gulf and surrounding areas.
[00:39:57.719 --> 00:40:03.545]  And the Pentagon has openly said this is to, quote, threaten Tehran and let them know that they mean business.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.741]  We know the White House wants to attack Iran.
[00:40:07.762 --> 00:40:16.788]  We know many of the Democrats on the payroll of foreign corporations, defense contractors, and foreign nations like Israel openly are saying they may go ahead and strike.
[00:40:17.268 --> 00:40:30.698]  Israel every day in their newspapers has different defense and intelligence chiefs saying they may go it alone with a massive nuclear bombardment of dozens of sites, hundreds of others to be hit by conventional munitions.
[00:40:31.198 --> 00:40:35.760]  The official Pentagon attack plan was leaked two weeks ago to hit hundreds of sites.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:55.769]  State Department officials have gone public saying they plan to hit their Navy, all their major military airports, their military infrastructures, their entire support system with a massive multi-month, continual, multi-thousand per week Saudi forays into the nation.
[00:41:00.982 --> 00:41:03.103]  These Saudis will... I'm not talking about Saudi Arabians.
[00:41:03.143 --> 00:41:05.203]  I mean attacks by aircraft.
[00:41:05.223 --> 00:41:06.484]  That's what they term it as.
[00:41:07.724 --> 00:41:10.625]  And Iran, of course, will not lay down and take it.
[00:41:11.605 --> 00:41:18.888]  Iran has already said they will mine different bodies of water that they're able to get into.
[00:41:18.928 --> 00:41:20.868]  Of course, the Persian Gulf being the main one.
[00:41:21.628 --> 00:41:29.791]  They have already reported that they will fire different types of water-skimming cruise missiles that are armor-piercing.
[00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:40.053]  That even some of the different Aegis systems and others won't be able to stop from sunburned missiles to the more primitive silkworms.
[00:41:40.113 --> 00:41:42.835]  They have literally thousands of these missiles.
[00:41:44.516 --> 00:41:49.999]  Can you imagine the image of smoking aircraft carriers, destroyers, and attack cruisers?
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:59.905]  The image of dead Navy SEALs who they're going to send into these floating oil rig platforms that the Iranians use as missile platforms.
[00:42:02.114 --> 00:42:11.860]  Of course, you'll have, in the build-up to this, a massive sneak attack on Iran, hitting nuclear sites, hitting military sites, hitting their... What was it?
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.801]  Back in the 90s, they had the case.
[00:42:14.882 --> 00:42:15.902]  What was it?
[00:42:16.042 --> 00:42:17.143]  In 1992, if memory serves.
[00:42:17.163 --> 00:42:18.023]  I've got to pull that up.
[00:42:18.964 --> 00:42:23.327]  Where they sunk a couple of big destroyers and damaged a battleship in Iran.
[00:42:23.347 --> 00:42:24.687]  Oh, yeah, the U.S.
[00:42:24.707 --> 00:42:25.448]  government attacked them.
[00:42:26.008 --> 00:42:27.209]  And the average American...
[00:42:28.013 --> 00:42:43.105]  Isn't even aware of that, though I've watched gun camera footage of those ships blowing up and sinking, and the Iranians have really built up their military counter-strike defense posture to deal with that.
[00:42:43.125 --> 00:42:47.909]  And I don't even know what to say about how bad this is going to be.
[00:42:48.389 --> 00:42:52.152]  Even if Iran lays there and takes it, which isn't going to happen,
[00:42:52.938 --> 00:42:55.220]  You're going to see the dollar further tank.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.124]  All the major Arab states are accelerating, running from the dollar.
[00:42:59.424 --> 00:43:00.725]  The Chinese are dumping it.
[00:43:00.805 --> 00:43:01.866]  The British are dumping it.
[00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:11.114]  The Germans, the French, the Swiss, the Dutch, the Japanese, they're all starting to dump dollars as fast as they can.
[00:43:13.156 --> 00:43:19.922]  And every major analyst has said that this is going to accelerate the wholesale dumping pell-mell.
[00:43:21.926 --> 00:43:23.727]  But again, this is what the New World Order wants.
[00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:25.809]  They want to get us into World War III.
[00:43:26.489 --> 00:43:38.338]  They want to get us into a fight that we start losing, and then, even though I know our government's controlled, our military's controlled, our culture's controlled, this isn't our government, we're being used for all of this.
[00:43:39.455 --> 00:43:44.257]  Even I, at a subconscious and primitive level, when I see smoking U.S.
[00:43:44.297 --> 00:43:56.062]  flotillas, and when I see the Iranians overrunning our troops, and warthogs attacking armored columns, you'll want to run out at least for a few weeks and cheer on the troops.
[00:43:56.542 --> 00:43:58.043]  This is the primitive psychology.
[00:43:58.083 --> 00:43:59.583]  We identify with the USA.
[00:43:59.903 --> 00:44:01.264]  We identify with America.
[00:44:01.704 --> 00:44:03.405]  We think that this defends America.
[00:44:03.425 --> 00:44:05.946]  But remember, those that are putting us in this position...
[00:44:07.748 --> 00:44:10.309]  Are doing it because it destabilizes the planet.
[00:44:10.369 --> 00:44:14.710]  It allows them to widen the war and to break Iran, Syria, and Iraq up into multi-parts.
[00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:20.171]  It allows them to make hundreds of billions a year off no-bid weapons and occupation contracts.
[00:44:21.672 --> 00:44:24.072]  It allows domestic dissent to be silenced.
[00:44:24.392 --> 00:44:25.353]  And hey, we're in a war.
[00:44:25.413 --> 00:44:26.353]  You've got to shut up.
[00:44:27.296 --> 00:44:32.040]  Newt Gingrich and others are saying, when we go to war, they're going to ban the First Amendment, ban free speech.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:39.746]  Michael Weiner Savage, the beatnik, says everybody should be arrested that criticizes the war, because that aids the terrorist when you're against the war.
[00:44:40.887 --> 00:44:44.249]  We have the Deputy Attorney General of a Democrat, California, saying that.
[00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.331]  I mean, this is what they plan.
[00:44:46.731 --> 00:44:47.732]  It's a Ponzi scheme.
[00:44:48.422 --> 00:45:04.788]  The very people voting for trying to push total blanket amnesty for the 30 million illegals, the very people putting us into the SPP, North American Union, the very people dismantling the sovereignty of this country, are the ones trying to push us into this war.
[00:45:05.308 --> 00:45:07.649]  Everything they do is to bring down the U.S.
[00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.170]  And this will be the last hurrah of the U.S.
[00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.292]  We will expend everything we've got on Iran.
[00:45:14.152 --> 00:45:16.913]  We will then be totally demonized worldwide even further.
[00:45:19.153 --> 00:45:32.139]  We will then be seen as the new evil empire, and the EU merging with Russia, which is now happening, will emerge as the world super state, allied with China, and we will then be known as a corrupt banana republic.
[00:45:32.459 --> 00:45:37.421]  They're probably then going to finance sectarian and racial civil war in the southwest.
[00:45:37.881 --> 00:45:42.143]  We will go into a deep depression, of course, before that happens, and the U.S.
[00:45:42.163 --> 00:45:43.924]  will just basically be out of the game forever.
[00:45:45.111 --> 00:45:45.932]  Again, the global issue.
[00:45:46.092 --> 00:45:47.214]  Use us to go dominate.
[00:45:47.574 --> 00:45:48.696]  Start World War III.
[00:45:48.956 --> 00:45:52.220]  The foreign banking families that own our Federal Reserve are predominantly foreign.
[00:45:52.501 --> 00:46:00.631]  They will use us to do their dirty work, then demonize us in the process, totally bankrupting our economy and the dollar, and totally dissolving our borders.
[00:46:01.412 --> 00:46:02.974]  And that is what will happen.
[00:46:03.996 --> 00:46:04.457]  We're good to go.
[00:46:20.257 --> 00:46:26.923]  This is all by plan, and you can't get past the primitive psychology, many of you out there listening, and so you will lose every bit of value.
[00:46:27.323 --> 00:46:29.065]  We're talking 90 plus percent in your dollar.
[00:46:29.365 --> 00:46:31.547]  You will lose your real estate value.
[00:46:31.827 --> 00:46:32.808]  You will lose everything.
[00:46:32.828 --> 00:46:34.149]  Your children will have no future.
[00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:43.538]  But darn it, you're going to get to sit there and drink whiskey and eat pizza and sit for a few weeks in your easy chair feeling powerful and good, and that's fine.
[00:46:44.358 --> 00:46:47.141]  The wages of sin are death, economic death, and degradation.
[00:46:48.835 --> 00:47:03.021]  Or we can have a massive renaissance of understanding and turn this around and point out how this government is run by treasonous traitors and how they brought us into the North American Union without Congress even knowing about it or congressional approval.
[00:47:03.401 --> 00:47:09.003]  And you can expose the amnesty program and the attempts at gun control and wake the American people up and say no to the war.
[00:47:09.223 --> 00:47:12.865]  But again, you have 78% against the war, 70-plus percent of the troops.
[00:47:13.365 --> 00:47:14.105]  They don't care.
[00:47:14.166 --> 00:47:15.166]  You're against the toll roads.
[00:47:15.206 --> 00:47:16.186]  They don't care.
[00:47:16.306 --> 00:47:17.607]  I guess you do know.
[00:47:18.527 --> 00:47:28.070]  It's just this 20-something percent, 22% or so, that sit up there and support this corruption, but I want them to know you don't even count either.
[00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:32.871]  You know, they feel like, well, I know most people don't want it, but this is what's best.
[00:47:33.491 --> 00:47:39.513]  See, notice how it's that 22% and the Democrats and the Republicans going, I know you've been right, Alex.
[00:47:39.553 --> 00:47:40.333]  I've talked to these people.
[00:47:40.913 --> 00:47:43.634]  I know you were right and said all this would happen in Iraq and...
[00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:46.595]  But darn it, I just got to support the troops.
[00:47:46.635 --> 00:47:48.997]  You support the troops by putting them through a meat grinder?
[00:47:49.817 --> 00:47:52.879]  The surge, admittedly, is meant to create more targets.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:48:00.044]  The surge is meant to have a debate about the surge instead of a troop pull-down, the mandate Democrats were sent to Congress for.
[00:48:02.485 --> 00:48:09.310]  We're going to break and come back and go to Angus, Greg, James, Ryan, and many others.
[00:48:11.252 --> 00:48:13.354]  And we'll take calls all throughout the next hour.
[00:48:13.714 --> 00:48:15.375]  And I'll get into a bunch of police state news.
[00:48:15.395 --> 00:48:16.556]  There's a lot of news today.
[00:48:17.717 --> 00:48:26.964]  I'm also going to play a bunch of different clips concerning Building 7 being blown up and firefighters, police, and others being told to get back.
[00:48:26.984 --> 00:48:28.185]  The problem is there's so many clips.
[00:48:28.225 --> 00:48:29.006]  How do you play them all?
[00:48:30.447 --> 00:48:31.868]  But before we end this segment...
[00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:43.079]  If you want to fight the New World Order, even if they launch World War III and bring us down, then at least we can recognize when we're in this third world system, it's still going to be America.
[00:48:43.439 --> 00:48:44.460]  We're still going to have to fight.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.822]  Then it's going to be a domestic police state.
[00:48:47.122 --> 00:48:53.968]  The next military operation is going to be against the American people domestically in a kind of new Cold War secret police type system.
[00:48:54.448 --> 00:48:55.489]  We've got to fight here.
[00:48:55.569 --> 00:48:56.770]  The real war is here.
[00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:58.392]  The real target is us.
[00:48:59.633 --> 00:49:01.074]  Iraq is just a part of that.
[00:49:02.961 --> 00:49:04.443]  It is the revenge of the Sith.
[00:49:05.243 --> 00:49:07.145]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[00:49:07.205 --> 00:49:08.707]  It's all against the Republic.
[00:49:08.787 --> 00:49:10.028]  And they are bringing it down.
[00:49:10.468 --> 00:49:12.250]  The country's officially gone right now.
[00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.052]  But we can still resuscitate.
[00:49:14.672 --> 00:49:18.917]  And I'm telling you, if you have a copy of Terror Storm, the history of U.S.
[00:49:19.397 --> 00:49:20.218]  sponsored terror...
[00:49:20.942 --> 00:49:26.666]  The history of government-sponsored terror, and you haven't made copies of it, or you haven't burned copies, you haven't given it to at least ten people.
[00:49:27.027 --> 00:49:28.007]  I'm begging you to do it.
[00:49:28.248 --> 00:49:44.220]  And if you haven't purchased Terror Storm from InfoWars.com and the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart, and you haven't made copies of it and gotten it out to everybody you know, I am begging you to go there and get Terror Storm and get it out to everybody.
[00:49:47.046 --> 00:49:51.628]  It is such an effective film, it is waking up so many people, and it needs to be seen by more.
[00:49:51.808 --> 00:49:58.551]  Get it from Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:49:59.111 --> 00:50:07.094]  You can get it for half price, or get American Freedom to Fascism for half price, as part of a special, as well, up on Infowars.com.
[00:50:07.115 --> 00:50:07.895]  We're talking $9.95.
[00:50:08.595 --> 00:50:14.438]  You can get American Dictators, my excellent film exposing the false left-right paradigm, for $5.95 in a special.
[00:50:16.554 --> 00:50:18.156]  Go to InfoWars.com.

[00:50:24.979 --> 00:50:26.460]  Have the actual DVDs.

[00:50:28.601 --> 00:50:30.862]  I get them from the people that made them, and that supports them.
[00:50:31.142 --> 00:50:32.743]  You get them from us, that supports us.
[00:50:33.023 --> 00:50:36.404]  But get my film Terror Storm at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:36.704 --> 00:50:38.525]  That's InfoWars.com.
[00:50:38.845 --> 00:50:40.706]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:50:40.726 --> 00:50:43.847]  It is in your hands.
[00:50:44.328 --> 00:50:47.369]  If you exert yourselves and take action, you're unstoppable.
[00:50:47.909 --> 00:50:48.690]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:49.950]  We'll go straight to your calls.
[00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:51.791]  A ton of news and a lot more.
[00:51:00.405 --> 00:51:03.609]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:05.872]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:06.252 --> 00:51:13.882]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:14.597 --> 00:51:21.661]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:33.447]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:33.787 --> 00:51:37.289]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:37.729 --> 00:51:39.690]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:43.852]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:51:44.452 --> 00:51:51.443]  Get your copy today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:51:57.347 --> 00:52:05.169]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:52:05.449 --> 00:52:07.030]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.751]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:10.151 --> 00:52:24.715]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:24.735 --> 00:52:25.055]  government.
[00:52:25.235 --> 00:52:27.056]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:52:27.416 --> 00:52:33.338]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:33.458 --> 00:52:37.959]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[00:53:05.333 --> 00:53:08.496]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:14.852]  I wonder if someday we'd hear Sting go public on 9-11.
[00:54:14.992 --> 00:54:17.573]  Hmm, I wonder.
[00:54:18.194 --> 00:54:24.276]  I know the Dixie Chicks know all about it.
[00:54:24.316 --> 00:54:26.658]  Why don't they go public?
[00:54:39.835 --> 00:54:47.239]  Let's go ahead and go to Angus in Canada and Greg, Ryan, Randy, and others.
[00:54:47.279 --> 00:54:47.919]  Go ahead, Angus.
[00:54:47.939 --> 00:54:48.520]  Thanks for holding.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.440]  Hello, Alex.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:50.221]  How are you today?
[00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:50.661]  Good, sir.
[00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:53.643]  It's wonderful up here in Canada.
[00:54:54.343 --> 00:54:56.904]  I've been up here for about 14 years now.
[00:54:56.984 --> 00:54:58.465]  Where are you in the Great North?
[00:54:59.006 --> 00:55:00.206]  I'm in Alberta in Edmonton.
[00:55:00.887 --> 00:55:01.247]  All right.
[00:55:01.287 --> 00:55:01.647]  Beautiful area.
[00:55:01.667 --> 00:55:02.628]  I actually lived in Austin.
[00:55:02.648 --> 00:55:03.768]  I went to the University of Texas.
[00:55:03.828 --> 00:55:04.909]  I'm an American up here.
[00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:06.870]  Married a Canadian gal.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.541]  Well, I've been here for some time watching from the outside.
[00:55:10.561 --> 00:55:13.163]  It was interesting what you had to say this morning.
[00:55:13.223 --> 00:55:14.384]  I think you're right on the money.
[00:55:14.404 --> 00:55:24.950]  I think what your global government's going to have to pull the world together, now that they're all fully socialist, is a world-class enemy.
[00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:27.991]  That's always been the paradigm, hasn't it?
[00:55:28.672 --> 00:55:29.572]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[00:55:30.112 --> 00:55:34.135]  I'm going off official globalist documents that we've covered, that we've detailed.
[00:55:34.355 --> 00:55:37.997]  Everything I said about shutting us up as the bad guy, that's admitted.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:43.242]  Okay, and it was even in the Sydney Morning Herald, I guess about seven, eight years ago.
[00:55:43.302 --> 00:55:44.903]  I covered it on air over and over again.
[00:55:44.923 --> 00:55:48.004]  It was a huge article, and I was already aware of the particular U.N.
[00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:57.928]  statements, but they said that, well, we've been denying there's a world government, but now the people are against it and all of its beneficent aims in their words.
[00:55:58.488 --> 00:56:01.830]  So what we'll do is we'll claim America is this evil right-wing government.
[00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:04.911]  I guess it was when Bush first got in, so it was like seven years ago.
[00:56:05.757 --> 00:56:12.659]  And then we'll claim the UN is a loving liberal world government and give people those two choices, but still you're within world government and it's a false choice.
[00:56:13.139 --> 00:56:13.979]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:56:14.019 --> 00:56:15.039]  I think you're absolutely right.
[00:56:15.339 --> 00:56:17.800]  As a matter of fact... Well, I'm not, but let's be clear, I'm not that smart, folks.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.480]  I just go off what they say.
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.461]  I mean, they're telling us what they're going to do.
[00:56:21.521 --> 00:56:22.661]  Please don't give me any credit.
[00:56:23.161 --> 00:56:26.522]  Well, I'm just saying, I agree with you.
[00:56:26.562 --> 00:56:28.182]  I've been paying attention for 30 years.
[00:56:29.102 --> 00:56:30.823]  I've been calling this since the 1970s.
[00:56:30.863 --> 00:56:32.243]  I've been watching where it's been going.
[00:56:32.878 --> 00:56:39.683]  There's a real interesting thing that's on Google Video that's a stand-up routine, and it's called The History of Oil.
[00:56:40.804 --> 00:56:46.288]  And it very blatantly shows the United States in that kind of a light.
[00:56:47.369 --> 00:56:49.831]  And I would encourage everybody to just go take a look at it.
[00:56:49.851 --> 00:56:51.332]  It's entertaining at the very least.
[00:56:52.753 --> 00:57:01.460]  But it's interesting that my father, who is now in his 70s, we had quite the blowout a few years ago regarding what was going on in Iraq.
[00:57:02.754 --> 00:57:03.955]  And it was very telling.
[00:57:03.995 --> 00:57:05.777]  He's an old Reagan conservative.
[00:57:07.178 --> 00:57:13.925]  And it was very telling to me when he admitted to me only a few days ago that the U.S.
[00:57:13.985 --> 00:57:17.408]  is in fact being run with a shadow government.
[00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:24.095]  And he quoted to me the Supreme Court statements regarding how we would have to get our laws
[00:57:24.756 --> 00:57:26.416]  In line with that of the rest of the world.
[00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:27.156]  That's what's happening.
[00:57:27.196 --> 00:57:32.497]  A lot of really smart people are finally going, okay, I better look at what these guys are claiming.
[00:57:32.517 --> 00:57:34.138]  And they're finding out we've told you the truth.
[00:57:34.518 --> 00:57:36.278]  We're sorry the truth is horrible.
[00:57:36.638 --> 00:57:38.038]  We're very upset too now.
[00:57:39.479 --> 00:57:41.499]  And so understand, we're all in this together.
[00:57:42.059 --> 00:57:47.360]  And we can admit to what's happening and try to stop it, or we can keep burying our heads in the sand.
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:52.681]  Well, I would just encourage people, we will have to take ourselves down.
[00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:55.111]  The rest of the world knows this.
[00:57:55.591 --> 00:57:56.331]  They can't do it.
[00:57:56.391 --> 00:57:57.671]  We've got to do it ourselves.
[00:57:57.731 --> 00:57:59.672]  And that's what the globalists are doing from within.
[00:58:00.232 --> 00:58:04.634]  Well, and, you know, and Christianity comes to play in that.
[00:58:04.894 --> 00:58:11.456]  You know, if we will turn our ways, even if we are not a majority...
[00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.832]  Yeah, turn back to God and seek His face and repent.
[00:58:15.352 --> 00:58:15.853]  Absolutely.
[00:58:15.873 --> 00:58:17.074]  Then God will heal our land.
[00:58:17.094 --> 00:58:17.754]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:17.774 --> 00:58:18.335]  Great call.
[00:58:18.875 --> 00:58:21.277]  Greg, Ryan, Randy, many others.
[00:58:21.897 --> 00:58:23.278]  Continuing with your phone calls.
[00:58:23.298 --> 00:58:24.339]  We'll try to speed it up a bit.
[00:58:24.959 --> 00:58:26.801]  The calls are all so great, so informative.
[00:58:27.161 --> 00:58:30.504]  And again, I'm blessed and honored and humbled to be your host.
[00:58:30.924 --> 00:58:32.765]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[00:58:33.005 --> 00:58:35.147]  We're fighting the creation of a prison planet.
[00:58:36.801 --> 00:58:37.382]  We're good to go.
[00:58:53.015 --> 00:58:53.675]  Big Brother.
[00:58:54.336 --> 00:58:55.396]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:56.096 --> 00:58:57.277]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:57.857 --> 00:58:58.677]  You want answers?
[00:58:59.438 --> 00:59:00.378]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:00.998 --> 00:59:04.700]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:09.262]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.813 --> 00:59:32.087]  We are now into hour number two on this Monday, the 12th day of February 2007 edition.
[00:59:32.167 --> 00:59:33.890]  I thank you for joining us.
[00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:35.554]  We're continuing with your calls.
[00:59:36.855 --> 00:59:40.957]  Coming up, 2006 personal savings dropped a 74-year low.
[00:59:41.297 --> 00:59:43.158]  We had preliminaries late last year on this.
[00:59:43.198 --> 00:59:46.160]  Now we have the official numbers out of the Associated Press.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:48.541]  Gulf states seem shifting away from U.S.
[00:59:48.681 --> 00:59:49.121]  assets.
[00:59:49.182 --> 00:59:52.623]  Also, they're intensifying the drive towards an attack on Iran.
[00:59:52.663 --> 00:59:55.525]  Webster Tarpley joins us in the third hour.
[00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:58.271]  Alex, everything is just like you say it is.
[00:59:58.311 --> 00:59:58.891]  I'm at an airport.
[00:59:58.931 --> 01:00:00.152]  There's a dome camera above me at the bar.
[01:00:00.172 --> 01:00:03.895]  They're asking 65-year-old women for their ID, and the women are flattered because they're asking about their age.
[01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:33.354]  Well, that's because the corporations, again, were told by the federal government to prepare them for the national ID card, swiping for national sales tax.
[01:00:33.575 --> 01:00:34.935]  It'll be a graduated sales tax.
[01:00:34.955 --> 01:00:42.479]  You'll have to ID with it to find out which one of the scales you're in, because there'll be, quote, people involved in sales tax fraud.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.741]  It's all part of preparation, all being trained like animals.
[01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:52.525]  And now I'm going to Canada over the weekend, supposedly for a nice trip to the casino, and I'm scared to death to come back.
[01:00:54.182 --> 01:01:05.465]  Last time I came back, they search your car and after they're done treating you like crap, they say, welcome home, welcome back to your country in a hostile manner.
[01:01:05.585 --> 01:01:09.186]  But the illegal aliens are allowed to do whatever they want and don't have to show ID to get bank accounts.
[01:01:09.546 --> 01:01:10.586]  That's all I have, Alex.
[01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.447]  I've just had it.
[01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:13.547]  I'm just frustrated.
[01:01:13.727 --> 01:01:15.147]  Oh, it's only the beginning, my friend.
[01:01:15.767 --> 01:01:18.008]  Wait until the military ground forces are half-foreigner.
[01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:21.468]  You'll have to salute them and learn to worship your foreign leaders.
[01:01:21.508 --> 01:01:21.828]  Thank you.
[01:01:21.848 --> 01:01:22.148]  All right.
[01:01:22.168 --> 01:01:22.608]  Thanks, Alan.
[01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:23.388]  Good to hear from you.
[01:01:23.428 --> 01:01:25.229]  Let's talk to Ryan in Illinois.
[01:01:25.269 --> 01:01:25.689]  Go ahead.
[01:01:25.709 --> 01:01:27.209]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:28.009]  Hello, sir.
[01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:35.371]  I wanted to ask you how you feel about civil disobedience, and particularly, do you think there is a time and place for rioting?
[01:01:37.512 --> 01:01:38.592]  Let me be clear about this.
[01:01:38.992 --> 01:01:42.573]  So many people listen to me, and I have a responsibility not to get people in trouble.
[01:01:43.756 --> 01:01:48.181]  I get on air and I detail how the income tax is a private payment to the Federal Reserve.
[01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:50.183]  Even Reagan's commission said that in 81.
[01:01:50.883 --> 01:01:54.667]  But I say, I don't tell you not to pay it because they're the mafia and they will come after you.
[01:01:54.707 --> 01:01:55.468]  That's your decision.
[01:01:56.429 --> 01:02:01.834]  I don't believe in offensive violence, but I do believe in defending yourself.
[01:02:03.195 --> 01:02:07.840]  And if FEMA's driving around telling you to go to emergency centers for no reason or trying to take your guns...
[01:02:09.301 --> 01:02:11.322]  It is up to you to decide what you need to do.
[01:02:11.682 --> 01:02:14.663]  And I would advise you not to go to the FEMA Center in almost all cases.
[01:02:15.503 --> 01:02:21.185]  Unless, let's say there had been some giant earthquake and it was a FEMA Center and they didn't have fences and they weren't frisking you.
[01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:22.246]  But they're going to do that.
[01:02:23.526 --> 01:02:26.207]  I don't, well let me just finish and I'll hold you over if need be.
[01:02:27.427 --> 01:02:31.589]  That's why I don't tell people to go do this patriot mythology of get out of debt quick.
[01:02:31.629 --> 01:02:34.990]  Most of that has some truth to it, but a lot of times you get burned.
[01:02:35.698 --> 01:02:36.078]  Um, well...
[01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:12.773]  How do you feel about the anarchist instigators that are in most of the protests who are starting the violence?
[01:03:14.134 --> 01:03:14.794]  They're hired.
[01:03:14.854 --> 01:03:15.754]  I'm totally against it.
[01:03:16.455 --> 01:03:19.876]  I've got to tell you, they're not hired because I'm one of them.
[01:03:20.276 --> 01:03:20.976]  Okay, stay there.
[01:03:21.177 --> 01:03:21.517]  Stay there.
[01:03:22.137 --> 01:03:23.097]  I want to break this down.
[01:03:23.157 --> 01:03:27.579]  I know there's ten plus different anarchist breeds.
[01:03:27.659 --> 01:03:29.820]  The black block, the red block, the green block.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.621]  I understand that, sir.
[01:03:32.061 --> 01:03:34.402]  But let's walk through it on the other side, okay?
[01:03:35.293 --> 01:03:37.237]  Will you stay with us, Ryan?
[01:03:37.577 --> 01:03:37.938]  Absolutely.
[01:03:38.299 --> 01:03:38.539]  Okay.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:39.661]  Stay on hold.
[01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:40.483]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:03:41.044 --> 01:03:43.728]  We're going to go back to Ryan after this break and break this down.
[01:03:43.949 --> 01:03:45.852]  Then we'll go to other callers and cover a lot more news.
[01:03:46.133 --> 01:03:47.175]  Infowars.com.
[01:03:51.852 --> 01:03:55.016]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:55.336 --> 01:03:57.278]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:57.659 --> 01:04:05.247]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:13.039]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:13.439 --> 01:04:24.864]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:25.164 --> 01:04:28.766]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:29.126 --> 01:04:31.087]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:31.387 --> 01:04:35.249]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:48.382 --> 01:04:53.483]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:04:53.543 --> 01:05:00.845]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:05:01.005 --> 01:05:11.627]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:05:11.827 --> 01:05:16.368]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:16.668 --> 01:05:21.649]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:05:21.849 --> 01:05:24.810]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:34.892]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:05:34.912 --> 01:05:39.813]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:41.613]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at Berkey
[01:05:47.034 --> 01:05:50.556]  Hi Michelle, I haven't seen you on the bus for a while.
[01:05:50.856 --> 01:05:51.897]  Did they change your shift?
[01:05:52.057 --> 01:05:54.078]  No Lori, I finally quit my job.
[01:05:54.338 --> 01:05:56.519]  I'm working at home now and I love it.
[01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:57.820]  No more commuting.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.501]  And I'm home when the kids get out of school.
[01:06:00.661 --> 01:06:01.521]  Working at home?
[01:06:01.922 --> 01:06:02.542]  Doing what?
[01:06:02.842 --> 01:06:03.763]  It's a long story.
[01:06:04.083 --> 01:06:07.024]  It all started when I discovered the website EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:06:08.985 --> 01:06:12.467]  Oh, Michelle, you didn't fall for one of those internet deals, did you?
[01:06:12.487 --> 01:06:15.690]  Well, I looked into several, and this one is for real.
[01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.910]  Are you sure?
[01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:22.194]  I didn't quit my job until I was sure, and now I'm making way more money working at home.
[01:06:22.414 --> 01:06:22.774]  Really?
[01:06:22.974 --> 01:06:26.537]  I've joined the Success Team and their major advertising co-op.
[01:06:26.797 --> 01:06:31.240]  Our business is fully automated, which gives me more money and the time to enjoy it.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.601]  I'll be earning money while we're skiing this winter.
[01:06:33.762 --> 01:06:34.922]  What was that website again?
[01:06:35.082 --> 01:06:36.503]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:37.664]  Here, write it down.
[01:06:38.885 --> 01:06:39.485]  Good idea.
[01:06:39.845 --> 01:06:42.066]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:06:42.326 --> 01:06:44.106]  Maybe we can go skiing this winter, too.
[01:06:44.346 --> 01:06:47.306]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com is a global opportunity.
[01:06:49.907 --> 01:06:55.948]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:56.548 --> 01:06:59.569]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.909 --> 01:07:06.810]  Again, Webster Tarfully to go into more depth on Target Iran, the gear up to kick off World War III.
[01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:21.255]  So many Democratic activists, liberals, who could see the tyranny of Bush, the Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act that literally made Bush a dictator during civil emergency.
[01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.478]  They're not calling for the repeal of it.
[01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:31.904]  The Democrats love the new powers, and many of them, I've looked at the traffic ratings on the big Democrat activist sites, they're dead as a doornail.
[01:07:32.544 --> 01:07:36.828]  But you, the Patriot Movement, the Truth Movement, are more awake and growing faster than ever.
[01:07:38.257 --> 01:07:41.078]  A large segment of society has gone quietly into the night.
[01:07:41.578 --> 01:07:42.619]  Kind of like Republicans.
[01:07:42.639 --> 01:07:44.840]  You can see all of Bill Clinton's corruption in the New World Order.
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.081]  Went to sleep for six plus years.
[01:07:47.121 --> 01:07:52.063]  They're now waking up whenever George Bush got into office.
[01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:52.843]  And that's how they do it.
[01:07:53.143 --> 01:07:54.324]  The Democrats take a step.
[01:07:54.544 --> 01:07:55.864]  Then everybody sees their tyranny.
[01:07:56.104 --> 01:07:57.265]  They go vote for Republicans.
[01:07:57.305 --> 01:07:58.765]  Then they move forward another step.
[01:07:59.466 --> 01:08:00.826]  And the Democrats get back in.
[01:08:01.146 --> 01:08:02.547]  And they just pass the baton.
[01:08:02.587 --> 01:08:03.567]  They tag team us.
[01:08:05.328 --> 01:08:05.928]  It's amazing.
[01:08:06.508 --> 01:08:07.249]  Going back to...
[01:08:08.619 --> 01:08:11.620]  Ryan in Illinois.
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:14.680]  For stations that just joined us, Ryan, you'd called in.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:23.582]  You'd said, do you think the anarchists are staged when they go out and start fights and try to start riots at different demonstrations and protests?
[01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:25.282]  And you said that I'm wrong.
[01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:26.463]  You've got the floor.
[01:08:26.523 --> 01:08:29.383]  Explain how I'm wrong, and then I'm going to come back and comment.
[01:08:30.483 --> 01:08:32.824]  Well, I just don't believe that...
[01:08:34.059 --> 01:08:37.842]  These people are being controlled by the government in order to do this.
[01:08:38.382 --> 01:08:41.785]  I think that we need to fight them in the streets.
[01:08:42.105 --> 01:08:45.928]  It's the absolute only way we are going to win if we don't fight them in the streets.
[01:08:46.408 --> 01:08:48.650]  They're going to be in our homes with guns pointed at our heads.
[01:08:50.651 --> 01:08:51.572]  It's as simple as that.
[01:08:51.612 --> 01:08:53.833]  I mean, there really is no way around it.
[01:08:53.933 --> 01:08:56.595]  We need to fight them in the streets with Molotov cocktails and rocks.
[01:08:56.996 --> 01:08:58.697]  Tell us how you became an anarchist.
[01:08:58.757 --> 01:09:00.578]  Tell us what group you identify with.
[01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:01.859]  Break it down for us.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:02.860]  Um...
[01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:06.931]  Actually, to tell you the truth, I am a veteran of the war in Iraq.
[01:09:09.172 --> 01:09:12.334]  And I feel extremely used.
[01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:17.878]  You know, while I was over there, I discovered that I was part of the problem, not the solution.
[01:09:18.678 --> 01:09:25.542]  And I feel like I need to do everything in order to just stop this tyrannical government.
[01:09:27.764 --> 01:09:32.567]  But at the same time, I've got to tell you, I don't feel that...
[01:09:33.223 --> 01:09:37.785]  Throwing a brick through McDonald's windows, a window, is necessarily a violent act.
[01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:39.726]  It's just a building.
[01:09:39.766 --> 01:09:40.967]  It's just property.
[01:09:41.567 --> 01:09:43.068]  I would never hurt an individual.
[01:09:43.468 --> 01:09:54.273]  And the only real violence that is occurring in the streets are by these police officers bashing in the heads of peaceful protesters sitting in the street and gassing us with mustard gas.
[01:09:57.114 --> 01:09:57.715]  He means CS gas.
[01:09:59.013 --> 01:09:59.673]  Yes, yes.
[01:10:00.034 --> 01:10:03.875]  Okay, first off, because I'm curious, what did you witness in Iraq?
[01:10:05.036 --> 01:10:06.817]  Well, I was in the infantry.
[01:10:07.617 --> 01:10:08.658]  I was in Ramadi.
[01:10:08.678 --> 01:10:09.758]  I was stationed there for a year.
[01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:12.019]  I was basically going door to door.
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.440]  I saw a lot of bad things.
[01:10:14.681 --> 01:10:19.363]  I did some pretty bad things myself, and I feel extremely bad about that.
[01:10:19.443 --> 01:10:23.645]  After I got back from Iraq, I joined this protest group called the Iraq Veterans Against the War.
[01:10:24.665 --> 01:10:25.346]  So I've been doing that.
[01:10:27.785 --> 01:10:28.785]  But you're an anarchist.
[01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:30.706]  I mean, have you thrown bricks through windows?
[01:10:31.746 --> 01:10:33.387]  No, actually, I haven't done that personally.
[01:10:37.328 --> 01:10:41.730]  Well, let's break this down calmly.
[01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:42.810]  But I do believe it helps.
[01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:46.511]  Well, let's break... I think it's a good thing.
[01:10:46.811 --> 01:10:48.252]  Well, why do you think it's a good thing?
[01:10:49.232 --> 01:10:50.833]  Because it's civil disobedience.
[01:10:51.093 --> 01:10:54.794]  It's saying to the establishment, it's saying to the state that we're not going to be obedient sheep.
[01:10:55.339 --> 01:10:56.379]  We're not going to follow along.
[01:10:56.399 --> 01:10:57.760]  We're not going to do what we're told.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.341]  We have the power and we're going to use the power.
[01:11:03.322 --> 01:11:05.703]  Isn't that what a demonstration is?
[01:11:06.343 --> 01:11:07.864]  It's a demonstration of power.
[01:11:08.284 --> 01:11:11.865]  If we're not willing to use that power, then it's not a demonstration.
[01:11:12.285 --> 01:11:16.287]  It's just a bunch of people in the street asking politely for things to change.
[01:11:17.687 --> 01:11:20.088]  Ryan, let me walk through this with you.
[01:11:20.128 --> 01:11:21.349]  Will you just listen to me for a minute?
[01:11:21.629 --> 01:11:21.789]  Okay.
[01:11:23.633 --> 01:11:26.994]  Let's play chess instead of checkers.
[01:11:28.394 --> 01:11:30.014]  I don't mean that in a condescending way.
[01:11:30.594 --> 01:11:32.815]  I'm deadly serious, and this is deadly serious.
[01:11:35.916 --> 01:11:52.559]  The globalist stage terror attacks in this country on 9-11 and Oklahoma City, to be able to blame it on their political enemies and say, look, they're violent, we need to be able to use force on them.
[01:11:53.954 --> 01:12:04.721]  Are you aware of how effective Mahatma Gandhi was in India by letting them beat them in the street in front of witnesses?
[01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:10.665]  That then totally turned public opinion against the occupiers, and that's what defeated them.
[01:12:11.025 --> 01:12:22.913]  The Indians for 300 years had been off and on fighting violently, sometimes with giant armies of hundreds of thousands against smaller armies of the British.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.841]  To no avail.
[01:12:25.603 --> 01:12:32.332]  They burned down whole areas of British settlements in and around major Indian cities.
[01:12:32.873 --> 01:12:33.534]  It didn't work.
[01:12:33.674 --> 01:12:39.302]  Now, I'm not saying there's not a time and place for violence, but if you look at Iraq, clearly
[01:12:41.108 --> 01:12:43.729]  SAS and others, British and U.S.
[01:12:43.749 --> 01:12:53.453]  special operatives and mercenaries, have been caught staging terror attacks, blowing up mosques, to get the Shia and Sunni and Kurd fighting with each other.
[01:12:53.553 --> 01:12:54.994]  They want civil war.
[01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:56.414]  They want dead U.S.
[01:12:56.434 --> 01:12:56.714]  troops.
[01:12:56.734 --> 01:12:58.175]  They want to say it's a quagmire.
[01:12:58.515 --> 01:13:02.256]  So they, quote, have to stay because it's a civil war.
[01:13:02.316 --> 01:13:04.857]  Before they went in, I said, there's going to be a civil war.
[01:13:05.398 --> 01:13:06.318]  It's by design.
[01:13:06.798 --> 01:13:11.880]  Here's the P2OG Pentagon Plan, the Strategy of Tension, the Global Balkans.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:12.860]  Now that's happened.
[01:13:15.221 --> 01:13:17.701]  But let's go back and look at the anarchists.
[01:13:18.081 --> 01:13:20.082]  You can go to Google Video and watch it for free.
[01:13:21.042 --> 01:13:26.304]  If you want to support us, go to Infowars.com and get the three CDs set.
[01:13:26.344 --> 01:13:27.344]  It's in high quality.
[01:13:27.764 --> 01:13:32.306]  Police State 2000, Police State to the Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:13:32.346 --> 01:13:34.466]  Three CDs in one package, $34.95, 45% off.
[01:13:37.242 --> 01:13:38.383]  The Police State Trilogy.
[01:13:39.023 --> 01:14:04.038]  The first 35 minutes of that two-hour film, The Takeover, my second Police State film, made in early 2000, shows the police, shows the anarchists, shows it all admitted that you had 60-plus thousand peaceful demonstrators against the World Trade Organization in Seattle against an unelected body putting us into world government, controlling our trade, which is essential to any free society.
[01:14:05.336 --> 01:14:07.438]  Or any country, for that matter, that has any sovereignty.
[01:14:07.458 --> 01:14:15.223]  50 anarchists were hired and trained and paid for by, quote, big leftist foundations.
[01:14:16.865 --> 01:14:23.329]  The black block was housed in a three-story government building by the police station and protected by police.
[01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:31.876]  On the first day of the demonstrations, they went out and burned trash cans, knocked out windows of McDonald's and Nike Town and Starbucks.
[01:14:31.916 --> 01:14:33.577]  They hit cops in the head with bottles.
[01:14:34.394 --> 01:14:35.075]  I think we're good to go.
[01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:35.956]  I think we're good to go.
[01:14:48.266 --> 01:14:48.746]  We're good.
[01:15:19.418 --> 01:15:42.482]  They set that precedent to then shut down, to have free speech zones, to crack down on peaceful protesters by hiring, this is admitted, hiring anarchists to go in and do this to then discredit the peaceful protesters that were non-violently blocking the highways and shutting down the conference and stealing all the media attention.
[01:15:42.702 --> 01:15:47.183]  So, I know there are real anarchists that go out and break out buildings and
[01:15:48.297 --> 01:15:51.760]  Punch cops when they shoot tear gas at you.
[01:15:52.521 --> 01:16:14.979]  But in Genoa, Italy, in Seattle, in Miami, in D.C., these are hired provocateurs, and in the case of Seattle, we reported it, later came out in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, in the Seattle Weekly, Seattle Times, all three papers, that Delta Force had infiltrators and was leading those groups.
[01:16:15.019 --> 01:16:15.659]  The U.S.
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:16.300]  military
[01:16:16.954 --> 01:16:18.756]  Was leading the anarchist groups.
[01:16:19.697 --> 01:16:21.318]  And I find it interesting that you're former military.
[01:16:21.558 --> 01:16:22.139]  And you're now one.
[01:16:22.159 --> 01:16:23.120]  You're being recruited, sir.
[01:16:23.941 --> 01:16:29.146]  And they went out and they did this so that they could then... And think how dumb the police were.
[01:16:29.366 --> 01:16:31.448]  The cops were on tape going, they told us not to hurt them.
[01:16:31.668 --> 01:16:33.229]  Then they housed them and protected them.
[01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:38.755]  And then the cops all got mad like a pit bull on the end of a chain you've been slapping upside the head for a month.
[01:16:39.015 --> 01:16:41.938]  They finally let them go and they attacked the peaceful people.
[01:16:42.038 --> 01:16:42.198]  So...
[01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:47.232]  Get more sophisticated in this model and realize they want it to get violent.
[01:16:47.273 --> 01:16:48.213]  They want it to get bad.
[01:16:48.673 --> 01:16:58.137]  They want every time there's a peaceful demonstration that's grabbing news headlines to be able to shut it down and segregate it because, quote, there's always violence breaking out.
[01:16:58.937 --> 01:16:59.237]  Okay?
[01:16:59.737 --> 01:17:02.338]  Now, do you grasp any of what I'm saying?
[01:17:02.358 --> 01:17:03.238]  You sound like a smart guy.
[01:17:03.739 --> 01:17:04.859]  Absolutely.
[01:17:05.399 --> 01:17:07.680]  Yeah, discrediting peaceful protesters.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.522]  But, I mean, I don't see any other way really around it.
[01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:19.236]  I mean, it wasn't the World Trade Organization was effectively shut down in Seattle.
[01:17:19.656 --> 01:17:27.123]  But not as well as it would have been in the last three days of the conference went forward because of the hired anarchists.
[01:17:27.623 --> 01:17:29.385]  You cannot, they were hired.
[01:17:30.065 --> 01:17:38.373]  We have video of them being trained in Oregon at the Socialist Ford Foundation funded compound.
[01:17:39.747 --> 01:17:39.987]  Really?
[01:17:40.528 --> 01:17:41.048]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:41.569 --> 01:17:43.290]  You need to see The Takeover.
[01:17:45.472 --> 01:17:45.632]  Okay.
[01:17:46.873 --> 01:17:48.454]  You need to engage in Infowar.
[01:17:48.595 --> 01:17:52.798]  You need to aggressively make copies of Terror Storm and other films like that.
[01:17:52.858 --> 01:17:54.760]  You need to aggressively organize other people.
[01:17:55.501 --> 01:17:58.022]  You need to keep yourself from being infiltrated.
[01:17:58.042 --> 01:18:05.623]  You need to be above board and stalwart and tell the people, if it comes to mass arrests and roundups and dictatorships, to defend yourselves.
[01:18:06.163 --> 01:18:08.344]  But you wait until they move in mass against us.
[01:18:08.384 --> 01:18:09.584]  You hope this never happens.
[01:18:09.944 --> 01:18:12.925]  And then you defend yourself, and it's not with bricks, my friend.
[01:18:14.245 --> 01:18:14.445]  Yeah.
[01:18:15.325 --> 01:18:22.087]  I mean, if you take it out of the box, if it goes there, it's all the way.
[01:18:23.058 --> 01:18:27.101]  Well, can I ask you, what do you actually, how do you feel about anarchy?
[01:18:28.682 --> 01:18:29.162]  Anarchy?
[01:18:29.242 --> 01:18:30.823]  I know you said that you're a libertarian.
[01:18:31.144 --> 01:18:32.345]  Yeah, it doesn't exist.
[01:18:32.925 --> 01:18:34.906]  Let me answer that after the break and get to more calls.
[01:18:34.946 --> 01:18:35.967]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:18:37.068 --> 01:18:42.552]  Just briefly, I'll give you my philosophy on anarchy on the real political spectrum.
[01:18:43.012 --> 01:18:46.915]  When we get back, the website's at jonesreport.com, infowars.net.
[01:18:48.934 --> 01:18:57.199]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:18:57.459 --> 01:19:01.801]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:02.102 --> 01:19:11.027]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:11.227 --> 01:19:14.829]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:15.129 --> 01:19:20.152]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:20.452 --> 01:19:27.155]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[01:19:50.604 --> 01:19:51.645]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:52.046 --> 01:19:57.532]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:19:58.113 --> 01:19:58.613]  That's right.
[01:19:58.914 --> 01:20:01.216]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:01.517 --> 01:20:08.705]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:09.245 --> 01:20:16.928]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:17.368 --> 01:20:22.230]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:25.872]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:28.653 --> 01:20:28.993]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:30.474]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:30.514 --> 01:20:30.674]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:30.754 --> 01:20:31.014]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.982 --> 01:20:51.484]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:52.025 --> 01:20:57.349]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[01:20:58.030 --> 01:21:04.195]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[01:21:04.855 --> 01:21:07.698]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:21:08.098 --> 01:21:08.939]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-
[01:21:23.234 --> 01:21:23.254]  516-8736.
[01:21:23.274 --> 01:21:23.474]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[01:21:28.076 --> 01:21:30.097]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:48.257 --> 01:21:51.860]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:21:52.121 --> 01:21:52.961]  Look no further.
[01:21:53.282 --> 01:21:55.844]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:21:56.284 --> 01:22:04.712]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:22:04.932 --> 01:22:05.373]  We're good to go.
[01:22:22.452 --> 01:22:22.892]  We're good to go.
[01:22:22.912 --> 01:22:23.313]  We're good to go.
[01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:23.733]  We're good to go.
[01:22:56.981 --> 01:23:10.729]  Yeah, when the Founding Fathers went ahead and kicked it off in 1775 at Lexington and Concord, it wasn't with bricks.
[01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:24.857]  We're doing everything we can to avert that, because the globalists actually planned for a civil war, starting in the Southwest probably, to happen to actually weaken the Constabulary to then bring in a second wave of I-4 bombs.
[01:23:26.138 --> 01:23:27.259]  International forces.
[01:23:27.979 --> 01:23:29.720]  And they're laying this out and scripting it.
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.381]  In fact, go find that clip.
[01:23:31.401 --> 01:23:33.502]  Remember the clip about shattered union?
[01:23:34.182 --> 01:23:35.102]  Remember that clip, John?
[01:23:35.943 --> 01:23:36.763]  Maybe we should play that.
[01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:38.704]  Okay, anarchy.
[01:23:38.824 --> 01:23:40.145]  Anarchy doesn't exist.
[01:23:42.326 --> 01:23:52.411]  Major studies, history shows, common sense shows that in groups of bigger than three people, two's company, three's a crowd, they say.
[01:23:52.871 --> 01:23:55.452]  Because once you get three people, arguments start.
[01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:57.170]  We're good to go.
[01:23:57.190 --> 01:23:57.331]  I think?
[01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:30.858]  Anarchy does not exist anywhere in the natural kingdom.
[01:24:31.799 --> 01:24:33.380]  It does not exist in the world.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:41.285]  Anarchy grows out of the French Revolution, which historically was kicked off by the Illuminati.
[01:24:42.045 --> 01:24:49.450]  Not to overthrow the corrupt monarchy, but to actually put in a new ruling class.
[01:24:50.504 --> 01:25:06.253]  So many times revolutions are simply another group going and speaking to the masses and trying to take the perceived or real wrongs and then trying to channel that into basically putting a new group into power.
[01:25:07.553 --> 01:25:13.557]  Or for a new group to have larger bargaining chips and then to make alliances with the older power structure.
[01:25:14.637 --> 01:25:15.618]  I mean, you go to...
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.922]  One of these anarchist meetings, and I've studied them, I've watched them for years.
[01:25:21.303 --> 01:25:28.088]  I've seen them meeting up before some protest where they're basically like a parasite attaching themselves to it.
[01:25:28.489 --> 01:25:30.370]  And there'll be a leader there giving the orders.
[01:25:31.191 --> 01:25:38.376]  And most of them wear red stars and Vladimir Lenin necklaces and rings and Soviet Union outfits.
[01:25:39.097 --> 01:25:40.158]  But they're an anarchist.
[01:25:40.378 --> 01:25:43.480]  They're supporting total government, but they're anarchists.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.721]  No, most of them are communists.
[01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:47.770]  You've got the black block, the red block, the green block.
[01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:53.312]  The green block's, quote, environmentalist, animal rights activist, but it's all the same crowd.
[01:25:55.473 --> 01:26:04.857]  Communism doesn't exist either outside of termites, honeybees, and a few other communal insects.
[01:26:05.337 --> 01:26:06.958]  And those are command and control as well.
[01:26:08.118 --> 01:26:13.981]  So communism's impossible in large groups of people because you're always going to get centralization and people are always going to abuse it.
[01:26:16.702 --> 01:26:22.944]  If a leader of a communist system wasn't, he'd be knocked off or she'd be knocked off overnight by some power-hungry person that did want the power.
[01:26:24.065 --> 01:26:27.146]  And the anarchist system is a fraud as well.
[01:26:28.706 --> 01:26:41.791]  It was anarchists that kicked off World War I. It's been anarchists that have been involved in so many things in this nation's history and so many attempted assassinations and assassinations of presidents have been, quote, carried out or blamed on anarchists.
[01:26:42.551 --> 01:26:45.312]  They're basically just a group to destabilize things.
[01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:49.632]  And they go around glomming on to would-be revolutionaries.
[01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:52.512]  It's very, very dangerous.
[01:26:54.133 --> 01:26:56.153]  And I'm not saying every anarchist group is controlled.
[01:26:56.433 --> 01:26:59.934]  I'm saying the ones that cause the most problems, the ones that get the funding.
[01:27:01.414 --> 01:27:05.175]  I am a paleo-conservative slash libertarian.
[01:27:05.235 --> 01:27:06.875]  I do believe in a tiny government.
[01:27:06.935 --> 01:27:07.955]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:27:08.275 --> 01:27:11.476]  Of all these terms, constitutionalist fits my views best.
[01:27:12.029 --> 01:27:15.572]  It's a system that's worked the best and created incredible wealth for the general public.
[01:27:16.152 --> 01:27:18.394]  It is the freest society you can possibly get.
[01:27:18.694 --> 01:27:23.658]  History hath shown with the complexities of human development.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.083]  And so people that just say no government at all, that's not going to happen.
[01:27:29.123 --> 01:27:30.864]  You're going to have an organizing force.
[01:27:31.225 --> 01:27:32.426]  You're going to have a government.
[01:27:33.326 --> 01:27:35.868]  And so it's not doable.
[01:27:36.489 --> 01:27:37.910]  It's not based in reality.
[01:27:38.811 --> 01:27:39.671]  It really takes on the...
[01:27:42.327 --> 01:27:44.647]  The tenets of a religion, of a cult.
[01:27:46.968 --> 01:27:49.388]  People think the Constitution and the Bill of Rights has gone wrong.
[01:27:49.448 --> 01:27:50.688]  No, we're not following it.
[01:27:50.769 --> 01:27:51.629]  We've reversed it.
[01:27:52.969 --> 01:28:00.930]  And so, instead of debating what type of pure anarchy we should have, we should debate how we can just get closer to a republic.
[01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:06.111]  And the real political paradigm, until about 110 years ago, wasn't left versus right.
[01:28:06.151 --> 01:28:08.052]  It was freedom versus tyranny.
[01:28:08.492 --> 01:28:10.452]  Freedom and liberty versus slavery.
[01:28:11.855 --> 01:28:17.077]  And in the middle of that spectrum is a constitutional republic.
[01:28:17.717 --> 01:28:28.141]  Almost every government in society and empire in history is very close on the spectrum to tyranny, never even approaching liberty and freedom.
[01:28:28.801 --> 01:28:31.462]  So you must have a government to guard your liberties.
[01:28:32.402 --> 01:28:34.763]  Alright, we'll be right back on the other side.
[01:28:34.803 --> 01:28:35.183]  Stay with us.
[01:28:38.951 --> 01:28:39.892]  We're on the march.
[01:28:40.332 --> 01:28:41.954]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:41.974 --> 01:28:45.617]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:48.019 --> 01:28:51.382]  Hey Jane, how's it going?
[01:28:51.742 --> 01:28:53.664]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[01:28:53.884 --> 01:28:57.867]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[01:28:58.347 --> 01:29:00.029]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:29:00.309 --> 01:29:02.331]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again.
[01:29:04.913 --> 01:29:06.514]  That would help control my blood sugar.
[01:29:06.554 --> 01:29:07.714]  That really works.
[01:29:07.994 --> 01:29:09.415]  Have you tried Sucrablast?

[01:29:38.461 --> 01:29:39.642]  So, Jane, what do you think?
[01:29:39.923 --> 01:29:43.748]  I'm going to call Sucreblast to set up a free consultation right now.
[01:29:44.088 --> 01:29:44.869]  Excellent, Jane.
[01:29:44.969 --> 01:29:46.111]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:29:48.806 --> 01:29:53.590]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:57.793]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:29:58.053 --> 01:30:04.357]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[01:30:48.678 --> 01:30:51.360]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN news bulletin.
[01:30:51.661 --> 01:30:53.723]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:30:53.943 --> 01:30:56.485]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:30:56.925 --> 01:31:01.289]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[01:31:01.409 --> 01:31:02.010]  Here's why.
[01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:08.656]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:31:08.916 --> 01:31:14.741]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:31:14.841 --> 01:31:15.402]  But they're not.
[01:31:15.542 --> 01:31:19.265]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:31:19.485 --> 01:31:23.729]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:31.356]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:33.637]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote, the U.S.
[01:31:33.657 --> 01:31:36.097]  Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S.
[01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:39.358]  history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th President of the United States.
[01:32:01.770 --> 01:32:10.773]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[01:32:11.613 --> 01:32:18.736]  In response, the President invokes the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[01:32:19.336 --> 01:32:27.519]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[01:32:28.683 --> 01:32:35.668]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:47.557]  During the 57th Inauguration Day ceremonies, Washington DC is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon killing David Adams and most of the US Congress.
[01:32:49.784 --> 01:32:51.806]  The destruction of Washington, D.C.
[01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:56.130]  effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[01:32:56.851 --> 01:33:01.975]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C.
[01:33:02.135 --> 01:33:04.658]  area to secure international interests.
[01:33:06.019 --> 01:33:13.366]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union.
[01:33:14.224 --> 01:33:21.285]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[01:33:23.286 --> 01:33:23.486]  Now.
[01:33:25.906 --> 01:33:29.587]  The once United States of America lie in ruin.
[01:33:31.307 --> 01:33:39.789]  The time for words has passed, and the Second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[01:33:41.431 --> 01:33:44.111]  They battle one another to reclaim a nation.
[01:33:45.412 --> 01:33:46.472]  To restore peace.
[01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:50.933]  To rebuild this shattered union.
[01:33:53.493 --> 01:33:54.193]  Welcome back.
[01:33:55.513 --> 01:33:55.874]  All right.
[01:33:56.214 --> 01:33:58.694]  I've got all these Building 7 clips.
[01:33:59.354 --> 01:34:01.414]  I've got Webster Tarpley scheduled.
[01:34:01.555 --> 01:34:07.275]  I've got loaded phone lines with Randy and Reno and Daryl and Jeff and Skio.
[01:34:07.295 --> 01:34:08.316]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[01:34:08.596 --> 01:34:09.976]  That call's here in just a few minutes.
[01:34:11.164 --> 01:34:14.185]  Let me just briefly finish before we go to Debbie Morrow for just a few minutes.
[01:34:14.225 --> 01:34:17.325]  Let me just finish up with anarchy.
[01:34:18.425 --> 01:34:25.827]  The point is, in about a matter of days, if you had real anarchy, government would develop, and it'd be warlords.
[01:34:25.867 --> 01:34:26.887]  That's the first stage.
[01:34:27.407 --> 01:34:29.128]  It'd be king rats, strong men.
[01:34:30.888 --> 01:34:32.468]  And so you don't want anarchy, folks.
[01:34:32.508 --> 01:34:34.349]  You don't want it to break down into that.
[01:34:35.009 --> 01:34:37.349]  The globalists want to break this country up with civil war.
[01:34:37.449 --> 01:34:40.590]  Every preparation they have made is for this.
[01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:45.051]  And that's what we face.
[01:34:47.352 --> 01:34:49.294]  This is the globalist plan to bring us down.
[01:34:50.235 --> 01:34:55.319]  And the liberals, the conservatives, the anarchists, the police, the government is all playing right into it.
[01:34:55.899 --> 01:34:58.101]  These global corporations want to be the global power.
[01:34:58.341 --> 01:34:59.662]  They're bringing down the U.S.
[01:34:59.822 --> 01:35:00.242]  right now.
[01:35:01.163 --> 01:35:02.564]  Debbie Morrow, thank you for coming on.
[01:35:02.604 --> 01:35:03.845]  It's been a few weeks since we've talked.
[01:35:03.865 --> 01:35:04.345]  How are you doing?
[01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.586]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:35:05.706 --> 01:35:06.547]  I'm doing great.
[01:35:07.007 --> 01:35:10.090]  It sounds very interesting things that are going on on your end.
[01:35:11.184 --> 01:35:12.546]  A lot of interesting things are happening.
[01:35:13.327 --> 01:35:14.308]  Water is life.
[01:35:14.328 --> 01:35:16.571]  70% of the human body plus is water.
[01:35:16.591 --> 01:35:19.414]  73% of the Earth's surface is water.
[01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:24.200]  And the normal tap water is just filled with everything you can imagine that's bad.
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:30.702]  And the chlorine only kills the bacteria, but there is Made in America, the Berkey water system.
[01:35:31.142 --> 01:35:35.223]  You also have the British Made, and you are the national manufacturer and the distributor.
[01:35:35.703 --> 01:35:42.566]  And Debbie works for the company just answering calls from a few talk radio shows where they now sell directly to the consumer in the last five, six years.
[01:35:43.406 --> 01:35:44.566]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:35:44.966 --> 01:35:46.327]  Thank you very much for having me.
[01:35:47.179 --> 01:35:50.620]  Tell folks in a nutshell about the Big Berkey water system.
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:55.361]  Well, the Berkey water filter systems are gravity fed water filters.
[01:35:55.381 --> 01:35:57.641]  You don't need to hook them up or plumb them in.
[01:35:58.281 --> 01:35:59.942]  You can take them anywhere with you.
[01:35:59.962 --> 01:36:01.662]  You use them all the time.
[01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:09.504]  They're not just an in case of emergency thing because we're in an emergency every day right this minute when it comes to our water.
[01:36:10.024 --> 01:36:14.225]  They're putting atrazine and benzene and ethylene and
[01:36:14.727 --> 01:36:22.897]  You know, chlorine residue, all this stuff that they're putting in the water and saying it's to protect you is very harmful.
[01:36:23.317 --> 01:36:29.284]  And the Berkey water filters take them out to a non-detectable level, give you healthy drinking water.
[01:36:29.344 --> 01:36:34.711]  It's one of the few things, Alex, that you can actually take control of every day in your life.
[01:36:35.455 --> 01:36:36.435]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:36:36.615 --> 01:36:48.898]  And explain, this isn't like some $30, $40 filter that goes on your sink that has a little bit of carbon in it and maybe cuts out some bad taste and reduces a few things and then builds up to be toxic in just a few months.
[01:36:49.338 --> 01:36:55.419]  This is a heavy-duty but easy-to-put-together gravity filter that cuts stuff out to non-detectable levels.
[01:36:55.739 --> 01:36:56.420]  Break that down.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.100]  Well, that's very true.
[01:36:59.245 --> 01:37:05.370]  You know those ones that you buy at the store that you just stick on your sink that start with a B?
[01:37:05.891 --> 01:37:13.597]  Well, those, they only take out chlorine, and you have to change them out every four weeks or every three weeks depending on the hardness of your water.
[01:37:14.337 --> 01:37:26.327]  Whereas our filters take out the pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, triomethanes, radiologicals, inorganic minerals, and the VOCs to a non-detoxable level.
[01:37:26.912 --> 01:37:27.273]  Thank you.
[01:37:43.812 --> 01:37:49.836]  If you did four gallons a day, that would be about four years before you have to change out the filters, depending on your water.
[01:37:50.136 --> 01:38:00.462]  I mean, you know, it's a win-win situation with a Berkey, because not only are they cost-effective, but they are taking out those poisons that you need to get out of your system.
[01:38:00.602 --> 01:38:04.224]  And in preparedness, water is number one on the list.
[01:38:04.644 --> 01:38:07.806]  They're very easy to put together, takes about two minutes, they're very portable.
[01:38:08.546 --> 01:38:10.648]  And I have given many of these as gifts.
[01:38:10.668 --> 01:38:12.269]  We use one right here in the office.
[01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:15.392]  Debbie, tell folks about some of the units and some of the specials.
[01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:21.317]  Well, we have the stainless steel Big Berkeys and Royal Berkeys and Trillium Crowns.
[01:38:21.857 --> 01:38:26.821]  They come with two black Berkey purification elements.
[01:38:26.901 --> 01:38:35.508]  And with that, you can either get two Berkey sport bottles as a free gift with your order, or you can get a base and a sport bottle for the Royal or the Big Berkey.
[01:38:35.959 --> 01:38:37.740]  We also have the little Travel Berkey.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:39.300]  It's a stainless steel model.
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.281]  It's a gallon and a half.
[01:38:41.841 --> 01:38:47.643]  It is available in California for those people that are looking for a stainless steel unit in California.
[01:38:47.663 --> 01:38:54.646]  And it's really great, and it comes with one free sport bottle or a base to put on top of.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:59.826]  Now, the sports bottles, they're kind of like a Brita, but it's handheld.
[01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:02.510]  It makes it safe to drink, cuts out all the bacteria.
[01:39:02.951 --> 01:39:07.216]  It'll do 600 and something refills a tap, 130 something out of swamp water.
[01:39:07.637 --> 01:39:10.020]  It's a survival thing or good to take to the gym or work.
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.684]  It just reduces it, makes the water safe to drink.
[01:39:13.924 --> 01:39:15.685]  You can put all sorts of things in it.
[01:39:17.026 --> 01:39:18.066]  It's a wonderful system.
[01:39:18.086 --> 01:39:18.666]  You get that free.
[01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:20.347]  You can also get five of those for $100.
[01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:31.312]  And a similar system is about $35 to $40 apiece instead of $20 apiece at your local hardware store or camping supply place or survival outfit.
[01:39:31.792 --> 01:39:32.992]  Give Debbie a call.
[01:39:33.032 --> 01:39:34.213]  She can answer all your questions.
[01:39:34.253 --> 01:39:36.254]  If she doesn't answer, if she's busy, leave her name and number.
[01:39:36.694 --> 01:39:38.995]  She or one of her helpers will call you right back.
[01:39:39.705 --> 01:39:43.631]  The toll-free number to call is 888-803-4438.
[01:39:44.251 --> 01:39:50.660]  That's 888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com.
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:54.546]  If you hear this at midnight tonight or 2 in the morning on the rebroadcast, call the number.
[01:39:54.566 --> 01:39:55.887]  She'll call you right back tomorrow.
[01:39:57.688 --> 01:40:01.192]  888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com.
[01:40:01.212 --> 01:40:12.863]  You can tell them which free gift you want there in the comments section at BerkeyWater.com or there's a big fat banner up on InfoWars.com that links over to the BerkeyWater.com website again at InfoWars.com.
[01:40:13.123 --> 01:40:14.345]  Debbie, talk to you again soon.
[01:40:14.365 --> 01:40:15.065]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:40:15.286 --> 01:40:17.648]  Thank you, Alex, and God bless everybody out there.
[01:40:17.948 --> 01:40:18.368]  You bet.
[01:40:18.408 --> 01:40:21.911]  She is a wonderful, sweet lady and very smart, and she will take your order.
[01:40:21.951 --> 01:40:22.611]  Give her a call.
[01:40:22.671 --> 01:40:23.692]  Talk to Debbie today.
[01:40:23.712 --> 01:40:23.752]  888-803-4438.
[01:40:23.772 --> 01:40:26.053]  People say I say it too fast.
[01:40:26.073 --> 01:40:27.955]  888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com or link through at InfoWars.com.
[01:40:36.936 --> 01:40:42.218]  Let's blitz through your calls, and I'm going to play The View from last Thursday with John Connor.
[01:40:42.978 --> 01:40:43.739]  Just amazing.
[01:40:44.299 --> 01:40:48.581]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Illinois.
[01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:49.781]  Thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:40:50.021 --> 01:40:50.621]  Hey, Alex.
[01:40:50.881 --> 01:40:53.923]  It's kind of interesting to hear the anarchists also from Illinois.
[01:40:53.943 --> 01:40:55.503]  We're not all quite that radical.
[01:40:55.543 --> 01:41:00.105]  It would be a shame to have a spark get about a billion killed in World War III.
[01:41:00.765 --> 01:41:02.246]  I'm a former broadcaster, and...
[01:41:03.712 --> 01:41:10.795]  Looking at the media in a different way like you do, I'm sure, it's easy to see how they feed us, what they want to feed us.
[01:41:10.975 --> 01:41:17.437]  I would like to challenge people to think about their audience they're trying to talk about, the things that are going on in the world.
[01:41:17.877 --> 01:41:20.298]  Use the different presenters, the audio and video.
[01:41:20.678 --> 01:41:22.959]  I found Aaron Russo to be very effective because...
[01:41:23.803 --> 01:41:26.684]  Freedom to Fascism, not any talk about 9-11.
[01:41:26.744 --> 01:41:29.705]  If you leave that out, they're interested to see about the taxes.
[01:41:29.745 --> 01:41:32.206]  It affects them, and then you can go right on into the chipping.
[01:41:32.726 --> 01:41:38.809]  But Lou Dobbs, Derry Brownfield, Paul Craig Roberts, my grandmother absolutely loves what he has to say.
[01:41:39.549 --> 01:41:43.110]  No offense to you, sometimes you're a little too over the top for some of them.
[01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:49.353]  You get the professional wrestling going, and I myself am craving another Global Love Cop episode.
[01:41:51.303 --> 01:41:53.806]  For those who don't know, tell folks who Global Love Cop is.
[01:41:55.147 --> 01:42:06.759]  Basically, he's a scheme-ass thug who gets his jollies from torturing, hurting, raping, beating, killing, and basically telling you how great it is to do it.
[01:42:06.779 --> 01:42:07.580]  And he gets paid.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.563]  Well, Global Love Cop only pops up every four or five years.
[01:42:10.603 --> 01:42:12.786]  I've only done Global Love Cop on the local TV show.
[01:42:13.988 --> 01:42:22.853]  I discovered you about eight years ago on CAT TV, cable access television in Fayetteville, Arkansas when I was living out there.
[01:42:23.013 --> 01:42:27.576]  It was amazing to see because I really didn't understand what was going on right then.
[01:42:27.596 --> 01:42:30.978]  It brought up questions in my mind.
[01:42:31.018 --> 01:42:34.720]  I got to investigating and it's absolutely blowing me away what's going on.
[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:37.582]  Another thing, what's going on with Ron Paul?
[01:42:37.662 --> 01:42:39.763]  I know he launched an exploratory campaign.
[01:42:40.610 --> 01:42:47.716]  Yes, they're just collecting money to start the main campaign right now.
[01:42:48.476 --> 01:42:50.418]  In fact, we're going to get the congressman on in the next few weeks.
[01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:59.485]  Will you have a way we can get some election paraphernalia from him available on the InfoWars site also?
[01:42:59.545 --> 01:43:09.493]  Because, frankly, Ron, Honorable Dr. Paul and Tom Tancredo, please, can we have those two, Ron, in one form or fashion as two?
[01:43:10.314 --> 01:43:14.116]  Well, Tom Tancredo is running, and he's running as a Republican as well.
[01:43:14.136 --> 01:43:15.177]  They're not running together.
[01:43:15.317 --> 01:43:19.920]  I think Ron Paul's head and shoulders above Tom Tancredo, no offense.
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:29.886]  Well, it's just interesting to see with the immigration things they've been pushing, because I know myself, I'm trying to immigrate someone here legally, and it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[01:43:30.406 --> 01:43:32.207]  But if you're an illegal alien, it's no problem.
[01:43:32.267 --> 01:43:32.708]  Yeah, I know.
[01:43:32.728 --> 01:43:35.469]  It's amazing the hoops you have to jump through.
[01:43:35.509 --> 01:43:37.991]  I took some of your videos over to the Philippines with me,
[01:43:38.413 --> 01:43:38.994]  Well, it's not a rumor.
[01:43:39.034 --> 01:43:39.414]  Yeah, it's...
[01:43:53.629 --> 01:44:02.172]  We've got now, no exaggeration, probably 500 hours of video we're trying to condense down to less than two hours, and it will be the crowning achievement.
[01:44:02.732 --> 01:44:06.753]  But it isn't about 9-11, and it's not about really the police state.
[01:44:06.793 --> 01:44:08.273]  It's the globalist master plan.
[01:44:08.814 --> 01:44:09.894]  It's amazing to see.
[01:44:10.734 --> 01:44:11.894]  I'm also a Freemason.
[01:44:11.934 --> 01:44:17.016]  I don't attend regularly, and I doubt if they knew how I'm thinking they would be interested.
[01:44:17.136 --> 01:44:24.763]  That's what I have to say, but I'm already in, so I'm just keeping that around just so I can kind of keep an eye on what they're doing as well.
[01:44:24.924 --> 01:44:29.648]  Well, you won't find out what's really going on until you become a 33rd degree.
[01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:39.598]  We'll organize a fish fry or something for the local thugs, and I do use that opportunity to speak about the local thuggery and make sure what goes on doesn't.
[01:44:39.958 --> 01:44:44.221]  Go on in my small area because it's a very small populated area.
[01:44:44.241 --> 01:44:45.442]  Hi, Harry, and I appreciate your call.
[01:44:45.482 --> 01:44:46.382]  Good to have you listening.
[01:44:46.863 --> 01:44:57.530]  For eight years, yeah, the power of you, the listeners, for really 12 years, taking my local TV show and putting it on access television stations all over the country.
[01:44:57.550 --> 01:45:05.175]  In the past, I had hundreds of people try to get me to basically tape my TV show and send it out to all these stations for free.
[01:45:05.335 --> 01:45:06.396]  I don't have the money now.
[01:45:06.556 --> 01:45:07.597]  Certainly didn't have it then.
[01:45:09.123 --> 01:45:12.926]  I barely had two pennies to rub together ten years ago, even eight, nine years ago.
[01:45:12.946 --> 01:45:15.408]  It was just me and one other person.
[01:45:16.329 --> 01:45:19.211]  Now I've got 12 employees and still we're overworked.
[01:45:19.371 --> 01:45:28.659]  But now with PrisonPlanet.tv, you can take all 15 of the films I've made, burn them in high quality.
[01:45:29.619 --> 01:45:31.021]  This is a lot better than Google Video.
[01:45:31.041 --> 01:45:32.101]  That's why you should be a subscriber.
[01:45:32.121 --> 01:45:35.224]  We have super high quality versions of my TV show and my films up there.
[01:45:36.581 --> 01:45:38.503]  It's near CD quality, DVD quality.
[01:45:38.523 --> 01:45:39.324]  It's not as good.
[01:45:39.404 --> 01:45:44.208]  You can just burn those right off the site and go put it on your local AXS TV station.
[01:45:45.068 --> 01:45:46.309]  Or buy the DVD from us.
[01:45:46.329 --> 01:45:46.950]  It's even better.
[01:45:47.710 --> 01:45:48.551]  And do that.
[01:45:49.092 --> 01:45:55.657]  But no, folks took my films over the years and they put them on AXS TV all over the nation.
[01:45:56.177 --> 01:46:00.100]  Folks had share groups who would tape them here locally and mail them out.
[01:46:00.521 --> 01:46:01.982]  It just happened organically.
[01:46:02.562 --> 01:46:05.245]  And my dad would be in a hotel room in New York and turn on the
[01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:22.523]  Cable at 11 at night and finishing some business deal and there I'd be or he'd be in Oklahoma and there I'd be or he'd be in California and a lot of other people say they'll be in some city and just turn the television on and there's Alex Jones.
[01:46:22.543 --> 01:46:23.924]  We really used AXS TV.
[01:46:24.264 --> 01:46:27.327]  There's still a lot of AXS TV facilities left though they're trying to shut them down.
[01:46:27.767 --> 01:46:28.828]  We should use those.
[01:46:28.888 --> 01:46:31.190]  If you've put my films on in the past, put them on again.
[01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:33.952]  If you haven't, it's easy to do.
[01:46:34.092 --> 01:46:35.233]  Get them and go out and do it.
[01:46:35.831 --> 01:46:38.073]  Or just do the old-fashioned thing that you know works.
[01:46:38.133 --> 01:46:41.295]  Make copies and pass them around person to person.
[01:46:41.575 --> 01:46:42.856]  That's how we're having an effect.
[01:46:42.916 --> 01:46:43.816]  I authorize you.
[01:46:44.257 --> 01:46:46.758]  I encourage you for non-profit, not for sale purposes.
[01:46:47.319 --> 01:46:49.180]  I hold the copyright on the films to protect them.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:52.862]  But I want you to get them and make copies of them and get them out to people.
[01:46:54.803 --> 01:47:04.590]  It's getting a little out of control when websites sell my DVDs for like four bucks a piece, make a few dollars profit, and then try to call into the show and plug them here.
[01:47:05.194 --> 01:47:06.555]  That's a little much, folks.
[01:47:06.615 --> 01:47:07.915]  I can barely pay my bills now.
[01:47:08.555 --> 01:47:11.316]  See, I don't do what normal corporate America does.
[01:47:11.336 --> 01:47:14.618]  People make profits in corporate America and they put it into their houses and their cars.
[01:47:15.238 --> 01:47:16.518]  I take almost all of it.
[01:47:16.939 --> 01:47:18.879]  Because possessions really annoy me.
[01:47:19.259 --> 01:47:20.880]  I don't even like the things I do have.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.041]  It's all a hassle.
[01:47:23.981 --> 01:47:25.382]  And Jesus was right.
[01:47:25.762 --> 01:47:28.323]  So I just take the money that comes in and it goes right back in.
[01:47:28.623 --> 01:47:29.263]  Right back in.
[01:47:29.703 --> 01:47:30.884]  And that's why we've been effective.
[01:47:31.906 --> 01:47:37.947]  Other people make profits off fighting the New World Order and they lavish themselves.
[01:47:38.327 --> 01:47:41.548]  And that doesn't mean I don't live in a comfortable house or drive a car that's reliable.
[01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:43.688]  I just don't worship those things.
[01:47:44.649 --> 01:47:48.769]  And as long as I've got enough money to live and feed my family, I'm happy.
[01:47:49.450 --> 01:47:52.490]  So you're not going to find really many people in the movement like that.
[01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:55.331]  But we do it here and that's why we're numero uno.
[01:47:55.851 --> 01:47:57.231]  Because it's a mission here.
[01:47:57.291 --> 01:47:58.411]  We're on a mission.
[01:47:59.171 --> 01:48:00.512]  And it's to fight the New World Order.
[01:48:00.552 --> 01:48:01.512]  It's to effect change.
[01:48:02.276 --> 01:48:07.739]  And I'm taking some of the capital I've developed and putting into this new film, upping the quality to a new level.
[01:48:07.799 --> 01:48:18.183]  In fact, I've just signed a lease on a bigger office at another location, and we're going to bring in some more folks to increase what we do on the web and increase the quality.
[01:48:18.804 --> 01:48:21.985]  Just a lot of things we're doing thanks to your help.
[01:48:23.559 --> 01:48:24.719]  And that's what thrills me.
[01:48:25.119 --> 01:48:26.660]  Hearing about folks that are waking up.
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:28.380]  Learning about people that have learned the truth.
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:30.561]  Seeing defeats for the New World Order.
[01:48:31.181 --> 01:48:32.261]  Seeing people awaken.
[01:48:33.302 --> 01:48:34.682]  I mean, that to me is wealth.
[01:48:34.802 --> 01:48:35.922]  That is what I hoard.
[01:48:36.002 --> 01:48:37.043]  That is what I crave.
[01:48:37.483 --> 01:48:38.843]  That is the apple of my eye.
[01:48:38.883 --> 01:48:40.264]  That is my deepest desire.
[01:48:41.944 --> 01:48:49.046]  I mean, I don't even satiate my own animal needs most of the time, folks, because I'm busy fighting the New World Order.
[01:48:50.359 --> 01:49:00.903]  I am so committed to this that many of the hungers of the flesh don't even affect me anymore.
[01:49:01.643 --> 01:49:02.844]  I am one-minded.
[01:49:03.044 --> 01:49:05.645]  I am committed.
[01:49:06.745 --> 01:49:09.206]  Far beyond driven would be the term.
[01:49:10.667 --> 01:49:12.167]  Not to say I do the best job.
[01:49:12.187 --> 01:49:13.788]  I'm very frustrated that I don't do it.
[01:49:15.069 --> 01:49:16.970]  The type of job I'd like to, but you know what?
[01:49:17.331 --> 01:49:26.037]  I'm in the arena, and that's enough, and I'm putting my full weight against the New World Order and all forms of criminal behavior and oppression that I see.
[01:49:27.057 --> 01:49:29.519]  And it is bringing in mighty harvest.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:36.804]  We drop our nets, and those nets literally threaten to swamp the boat because we're catching so many fish.
[01:49:38.005 --> 01:49:43.609]  The fight continues with your calls, tons of news, Webster Tarpley on the other side.
[01:49:44.301 --> 01:49:45.221]  Everybody stay with us.
[01:49:45.561 --> 01:49:47.042]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[01:49:49.242 --> 01:49:55.083]  Hey ladies, if you love to shop, then visit HerbalHealer.com to browse through their online catalog.

[01:50:27.025 --> 01:50:28.406]  We're good to go.
[01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:55.232]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:55.573 --> 01:50:57.495]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:57.895 --> 01:51:05.503]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:06.215 --> 01:51:13.278]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:13.678 --> 01:51:25.123]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:51:25.403 --> 01:51:28.965]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:51:29.365 --> 01:51:31.306]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:51:31.646 --> 01:51:35.488]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:49.133 --> 01:51:54.355]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:51:54.515 --> 01:52:02.598]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:52:02.858 --> 01:52:09.900]  Medical Corps potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:22.622]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:52:22.722 --> 01:52:31.604]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:52:31.864 --> 01:52:35.385]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:52:37.265 --> 01:52:37.765]  We're good to go.
[01:52:54.261 --> 01:52:55.982]  Tarpley's coming up in about 10 minutes.
[01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:57.623]  Those blaster calls right now.
[01:52:57.643 --> 01:53:04.448]  We'll be getting into Building 7, 9-11, Target, Iran, a lot of new developments, vital info coming up.
[01:53:04.968 --> 01:53:07.410]  Lino in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding patiently.
[01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:08.070]  You're on the air.
[01:53:09.111 --> 01:53:10.012]  Hello, how are you doing?
[01:53:10.172 --> 01:53:10.512]  Good, sir.
[01:53:11.533 --> 01:53:17.677]  First of all, I want to thank you for opening up the doors for people to make a change and stuff like that.
[01:53:17.797 --> 01:53:20.519]  And for the callers, don't call in with the...
[01:53:21.167 --> 01:53:22.008]  We're good to go.
[01:53:50.242 --> 01:53:53.804]  Because I have an entertainment website and stuff like that.
[01:53:53.964 --> 01:53:54.204]  Good.
[01:53:54.224 --> 01:53:54.985]  What's your website?
[01:53:55.585 --> 01:53:57.846]  puffedoutent.com All right.
[01:53:58.146 --> 01:54:17.117]  Yeah, and I'm also making it, taking it to another level, and I'm coming out with a hip-hop group called the Warrior Union, and also I have a little page on MySpace of the Warrior Union, you know, some information that I have researched myself, and, you know, from listening to your show and watching your DVDs and stuff like that.
[01:54:18.283 --> 01:54:27.527]  But the thing is, to what extent, I mean, that I can do this in a public way to where it's not being harmful?
[01:54:28.908 --> 01:54:36.772]  Well, I mean, as long as you don't let them use you as a provocateur to be able to shut down protests, it's not a problem.
[01:54:36.812 --> 01:54:37.892]  Everything you do is good.
[01:54:38.152 --> 01:54:40.533]  And don't expect to save the world on your own.
[01:54:40.573 --> 01:54:45.356]  It's all of us working together that is having the big effect here.
[01:54:46.196 --> 01:54:46.376]  Yeah.
[01:54:47.577 --> 01:54:47.797]  Okay.
[01:54:48.579 --> 01:54:57.584]  That's basically what I wanted to know, and that gives me a little bit more better insight that I can... Look, you may not have an AXS TV station in your area.
[01:54:57.804 --> 01:54:59.485]  Look at four or five towns around you.
[01:54:59.605 --> 01:55:00.225]  One of them will.
[01:55:00.545 --> 01:55:01.586]  Go do a show there.
[01:55:02.066 --> 01:55:04.507]  Start a news section on your website.
[01:55:04.867 --> 01:55:06.288]  Start calling in to talk radio.
[01:55:06.328 --> 01:55:08.009]  It's a liberty culture.
[01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:09.210]  Make copies of films.
[01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:10.650]  Have showings at the library.
[01:55:11.231 --> 01:55:14.612]  Millions of us doing this will take this nation back, and it is happening.
[01:55:14.892 --> 01:55:15.593]  Thank you for the call.
[01:55:16.413 --> 01:55:19.435]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Darrell in Virginia.
[01:55:19.455 --> 01:55:20.616]  Thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:55:20.636 --> 01:55:21.676]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:21.696 --> 01:55:22.277]  How are you doing?
[01:55:22.297 --> 01:55:22.637]  Good, sir.
[01:55:22.657 --> 01:55:24.358]  It's good to talk to you today.
[01:55:24.458 --> 01:55:26.439]  I've got four points I wanted to bring up to you.
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:37.686]  One is I have a contact at the SPP office, and I made contact with the CFR office, and I've got a couple billboards going up in the D.C.
[01:55:37.786 --> 01:55:41.108]  area, and I became a member of the local Republicans group.
[01:55:41.988 --> 01:55:45.230]  And one of the contacts I have at the SPP is,
[01:55:45.988 --> 01:55:51.150]  You're talking about the Security and Prosperity Partnership of the North American Union Consortium?
[01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:52.190]  Absolutely.
[01:55:52.210 --> 01:56:03.594]  I made contact with this individual who's pretty much a low-level individual, but she put me in contact with someone who certainly said, oh, we'll be glad to answer your questions.
[01:56:03.654 --> 01:56:04.935]  This is not going to happen.
[01:56:05.942 --> 01:56:09.044]  We're just integrating governance.
[01:56:09.084 --> 01:56:11.166]  We're not setting up a North American government.
[01:56:11.506 --> 01:56:12.927]  Governance is government.
[01:56:13.327 --> 01:56:13.868]  Absolutely.
[01:56:14.408 --> 01:56:15.529]  They play word games.
[01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.670]  Absolutely.
[01:56:16.930 --> 01:56:20.312]  They're basic spin doctors on every possible level.
[01:56:20.352 --> 01:56:32.601]  But the point I'm trying to make is she asserted her viewpoint that Lou Dobbs, she believed in Lou Dobbs until he stated vehemently that he actually...
[01:56:33.536 --> 01:56:35.898]  It said that the SPP website was down.
[01:56:36.338 --> 01:56:39.800]  So I made contact with Lou Dobbs.
[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:44.383]  When he contacted me back, they said, no, that's never a statement that they've ever issued.
[01:56:45.023 --> 01:56:52.948]  So by her own suggestion to check the story out, she refused to take my next few phone calls.
[01:56:52.968 --> 01:56:57.531]  So when I finally did speak with her, she wouldn't even confront the issue.
[01:56:57.731 --> 01:57:03.114]  Well, sir, members of Congress say it doesn't exist while they're merging the countries and Bush signed it.
[01:57:03.763 --> 01:57:04.824]  I mean, this is what they do.
[01:57:04.844 --> 01:57:06.325]  They bald-faced lie.
[01:57:07.365 --> 01:57:23.976]  And so, look, we got the four-year request a month ago from the North American Union Summit held in September of 2006, and they opened the meeting with how to keep it secret from the American, Canadian, and Mexican people.
[01:57:24.957 --> 01:57:25.937]  Hey, stay there briefly.
[01:57:25.957 --> 01:57:27.178]  I want to hear about these billboards.
[01:57:28.863 --> 01:57:36.008]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:45.015 --> 01:57:45.695]  Big Brother.
[01:57:46.316 --> 01:57:47.416]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:48.097 --> 01:57:49.238]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:49.858 --> 01:57:50.679]  You want answers?
[01:57:51.419 --> 01:57:52.200]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:56.932]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:57.152 --> 01:58:01.234]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.042 --> 01:58:25.820]  Now into hour number three of this February 12, 2007 edition, Webster Griffin Tarpley, author of 9-11, Synthetic Terror Made in the USA with Big New Developments, From 9-11 Truth to Target Iran.
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:26.961]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:58:26.981 --> 01:58:30.165]  You know, I said Friday, I did play a lot of clips and spent about 30 minutes on it.
[01:58:31.327 --> 01:58:37.689]  That on Monday I would get into the bombs in the buildings and all the new firefighters and police and emergency workers that have gone public.
[01:58:37.749 --> 01:58:42.370]  And right now, John up at the network in Minnesota has, I don't know, 15-something clips.
[01:58:43.571 --> 01:58:47.972]  I've just got to pick a day this week to play all these.
[01:58:48.092 --> 01:58:52.634]  And I've also got a bunch of other clips we found that I didn't even have time to get to him.
[01:58:52.674 --> 01:58:57.175]  So I want to do justice to this and show you how it's a whole bunch of people saying this.
[01:58:57.235 --> 01:59:00.636]  I mean, we've already done this, but I want to do it even with more power
[01:59:01.553 --> 01:59:02.814]  And we've just got to take time out to do it.
[01:59:02.834 --> 01:59:04.835]  So I'll do it sometime later this week.
[01:59:05.155 --> 01:59:09.138]  I am going to play the John Connor clip where he got plugged on The View.
[01:59:09.218 --> 01:59:10.039]  That's really weird.
[01:59:10.679 --> 01:59:12.480]  And what seems to be happening on that show.
[01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:14.361]  We'll do that right before Tarpley joins us.
[01:59:14.842 --> 01:59:17.163]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:59:17.804 --> 01:59:19.525]  Jeff in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:59:19.925 --> 01:59:20.966]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:59:21.186 --> 01:59:21.826]  Thanks for calling.
[01:59:22.567 --> 01:59:23.347]  How's it going out there?
[01:59:24.488 --> 01:59:26.790]  Well, doing a worldwide broadcast, sir.
[01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:29.511]  My comment is about Obama.
[01:59:29.531 --> 01:59:30.052]  Did you get my...
[01:59:31.164 --> 01:59:32.545]  You take MySpace messages?
[01:59:33.105 --> 01:59:33.426]  I did.
[01:59:33.726 --> 01:59:37.128]  I scan that about once a day, but I don't think I saw your comment.
[01:59:37.168 --> 01:59:37.769]  I mean, who cares?
[01:59:37.809 --> 01:59:39.390]  He's a total New World Order minion.
[01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:44.253]  Anybody they're pushing, from Hillary to Newt Gingrich to Obama, is a total globalist.
[01:59:44.373 --> 01:59:48.075]  And the guys for gun control, open borders, he's horrible.
[01:59:48.456 --> 01:59:52.659]  Yeah, and I just thought maybe that he was a plant by...
[01:59:54.979 --> 01:59:57.820]  I don't think so.
[01:59:58.361 --> 02:00:02.002]  I mean, he's got some grandparent or something, or great-grandparent that was a Muslim.
[02:00:02.442 --> 02:00:04.202]  No, he's a New World Order minion, sir.
[02:00:04.582 --> 02:00:04.983]  Which group?
[02:00:05.003 --> 02:00:06.883]  There's about ten different Minutemen.
[02:00:14.131 --> 02:00:15.712]  I think they're doing a great job.
[02:00:16.172 --> 02:00:23.014]  They're just out there with their binoculars calling police by cell phone when they see people committing felonies.
[02:00:23.214 --> 02:00:34.817]  Yeah, I think one of the reasons the government don't like them and they're trying to get them passed as domestic terrorists is that when they do try to get this North American Union passed, there'll be a threat to them.
[02:00:35.322 --> 02:00:35.842]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:00:35.862 --> 02:00:42.266]  They're a threat now, exposing that nothing's being done on the border, but the police want to treat citizens like inmates.
[02:00:42.306 --> 02:00:43.046]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:43.287 --> 02:00:43.787]  And we're not.
[02:00:43.827 --> 02:00:45.048]  The government doesn't own us.
[02:00:45.068 --> 02:00:45.828]  You're not God.
[02:00:46.688 --> 02:00:48.189]  Skio in Pennsylvania.
[02:00:48.249 --> 02:00:48.830]  You're on the air.
[02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:49.850]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:49.890 --> 02:00:50.571]  How's it going?
[02:00:50.591 --> 02:00:50.851]  Good.
[02:00:51.551 --> 02:00:51.711]  Good.
[02:00:52.892 --> 02:00:56.414]  I started to call in with a question to you, but then I heard the anarchist.
[02:00:56.974 --> 02:01:01.717]  And for a split second, I thought he sounded pretty good until you said it all straight.
[02:01:02.119 --> 02:01:04.242]  And I want to tell you thank you.
[02:01:04.262 --> 02:01:05.084]  I appreciate that.
[02:01:05.224 --> 02:01:06.786]  Well, don't believe my opinion on it.
[02:01:06.806 --> 02:01:07.768]  Just research it yourself.
[02:01:08.489 --> 02:01:10.572]  I've seen all your videos, and they're all great.
[02:01:10.592 --> 02:01:11.393]  They're all number one.
[02:01:12.375 --> 02:01:15.680]  The reason why I called you is because I had a little question for you.
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:16.040]  Are you a U.S.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:16.401]  citizen?
[02:01:17.922 --> 02:01:25.065]  I was born in the United States, and I have an allegiance to the Bill of Rights and Constitution and the original United States.
[02:01:25.245 --> 02:01:26.525]  I am a Texas citizen.
[02:01:26.785 --> 02:01:31.067]  It's a very complex issue, but I am not a citizen of the District of Columbia.
[02:01:31.687 --> 02:01:41.531]  And they claim all these powers that are not just and are not real, just like the governor of Texas claims you've got to take a live cancer virus when there is no law, but he says it's a law.
[02:01:43.312 --> 02:01:43.832]  That's right.
[02:01:44.733 --> 02:01:54.016]  And people like myself, when I first got into the understanding of what's been going on, I couldn't understand how I became a 14th Amendment citizen.
[02:01:55.137 --> 02:01:57.618]  Which makes you a slave and gives you privileges.
[02:01:58.138 --> 02:01:58.578]  Correct.
[02:01:58.598 --> 02:01:59.919]  They never gave blacks freedom.
[02:01:59.939 --> 02:02:01.199]  They just made us all slaves.
[02:02:01.559 --> 02:02:02.039]  That's right.
[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:02.920]  Exactly.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:07.782]  And that's why I'm starting the State Citizen Sovereignty Movement.
[02:02:09.142 --> 02:02:11.463]  And what I like to do is be able to...
[02:02:12.498 --> 02:02:17.980]  Get with a bunch of local-minded people who would like to push their state sovereignty.
[02:02:18.941 --> 02:02:25.724]  The first thing you've got to do is set up a website and put out your manifesto, and you will start getting members.
[02:02:26.424 --> 02:02:33.227]  I mean, it was just a few months ago that one state was fighting the national ID card, and now 36 of them are pulling out and growing.
[02:02:33.747 --> 02:02:34.227]  Keep it up.
[02:02:34.267 --> 02:02:35.628]  Let me see your website when you get one.
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:47.081]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:47.422 --> 02:02:49.362]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:49.723 --> 02:02:57.346]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:58.058 --> 02:03:05.122]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:05.502 --> 02:03:16.928]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.248 --> 02:03:20.750]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:21.211 --> 02:03:23.152]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:23.472 --> 02:03:27.314]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:45.711]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:03:45.931 --> 02:03:47.992]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:03:48.252 --> 02:03:55.353]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:03:55.493 --> 02:04:07.016]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[02:04:07.336 --> 02:04:08.137]  We're good to go.
[02:04:38.257 --> 02:04:44.401]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:44.541 --> 02:04:46.703]  When was the last time you used Pure Soap?
[02:04:46.983 --> 02:04:57.071]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:04:57.391 --> 02:04:59.773]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[02:04:59.913 --> 02:05:03.976]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[02:05:04.196 --> 02:05:05.237]  We're good to go.
[02:05:05.357 --> 02:05:06.038]  We're good to go.
[02:05:23.832 --> 02:05:24.352]  We're good to go.
[02:05:55.178 --> 02:05:57.680]  We're good to go.
[02:06:18.288 --> 02:06:28.013]  Synthetic Terror Made in the USA is the preeminent book on the wide-ranging, big view of how false flag terror events are carried out, how 9-11 was carried out.
[02:06:28.053 --> 02:06:29.334]  His third edition is now here.
[02:06:29.714 --> 02:06:32.876]  We have it in stock, available at Infowars.com.
[02:06:32.916 --> 02:06:34.037]  But before we get into...
[02:06:34.918 --> 02:06:35.739]  We're good to go.
[02:06:56.861 --> 02:07:01.682]  And it's clearly scripted that they know who John Connor is in the Resistance Manifesto.
[02:07:01.702 --> 02:07:10.384]  And I think they're more talking about a composite of not just John Connor, but everybody who runs out and says 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:07:11.024 --> 02:07:20.286]  Of course, they had another pretty big Hollywood star and TV star on a few months ago who went on there.
[02:07:21.244 --> 02:07:21.604]  We're good to go.
[02:07:33.075 --> 02:07:38.076]  Just said, listen, everybody needs to go visit, you know, what was the website?
[02:07:38.116 --> 02:07:42.758]  WeKnow911.com, which basically exposes it as an inside job.
[02:07:42.798 --> 02:07:49.640]  And they all, including Barbara Walters, look at him very knowingly, like, oh, my gosh, he just let the cat out of the bag.
[02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:54.741]  So basically what Rosie O'Donnell was doing there was just an icon of the left.
[02:07:55.421 --> 02:07:57.922]  She was using John Connor as an excuse to,
[02:07:58.582 --> 02:08:01.805]  To say 9-11's an inside job, 9-11's an inside job.
[02:08:01.845 --> 02:08:12.232]  She pretends to be bullhorning, and even though they kind of giggle and make fun of him, and one woman on there is swooning over him, it's a way of getting it out there.
[02:08:12.272 --> 02:08:17.776]  And this is seen on an average day by around 15 to 17 million people.
[02:08:17.817 --> 02:08:24.942]  It's one of the most highly viewed TV shows left on broadcast TV as the other television shows are continually losing their numbers.
[02:08:25.609 --> 02:08:33.611]  Of course, the other individual with the number one TV show period right now, not just number one comedy, now number one in the last few weeks is Charlie Sheen.
[02:08:34.231 --> 02:08:40.612]  Notice his show went from being the number one comedy, number four overall, to being total number one after he went public on 9-11.
[02:08:40.712 --> 02:08:41.872]  He's also very talented.
[02:08:42.713 --> 02:08:51.014]  But the point is, more and more people going public, David Lynch, others, and it shows people courage that they're doing this.
[02:08:51.575 --> 02:08:53.455]  And Webster Tarpley has said early on,
[02:08:54.648 --> 02:09:05.736]  And I didn't like to toot my own horn, but in retrospect, C-SPAN has admitted on their own website that it was the most viewed and the most requested, their most viewed and most requested stays up as a top link.
[02:09:06.116 --> 02:09:10.079]  Normally stuff, even a speech by Ahmed Dinejad or Bush is only up there a day or two.
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:12.001]  It was up there for two months.
[02:09:12.421 --> 02:09:12.861]  We're good to go.
[02:09:41.778 --> 02:09:51.885]  John Connor, who does a radio show Sunday nights here on Genesis, and will be moving to weekdays very, very soon with Webster Tarpley.
[02:09:51.905 --> 02:09:57.648]  They're going to share kind of a variety show Monday through Friday with Daniel Abramson and others.
[02:09:57.888 --> 02:09:58.429]  But here it is.
[02:09:59.111 --> 02:10:02.393]  YouTube is like the final frontier of my addiction, you know?
[02:10:02.433 --> 02:10:05.075]  So at 4.30 in the morning, you can find me on YouTube.
[02:10:05.375 --> 02:10:12.299]  So the political one, there's a couple of political ones, but the latest one I found, oh my God, I am like so crazy about this guy.
[02:10:12.419 --> 02:10:14.520]  It's called TheResistanceManifesto.com.
[02:10:15.681 --> 02:10:15.962]  Yes.
[02:10:16.022 --> 02:10:17.303]  John Connor.
[02:10:17.343 --> 02:10:18.184]  John Connor.
[02:10:18.264 --> 02:10:19.486]  I'm going to write it down.
[02:10:19.646 --> 02:10:21.748]  It's so amazing.
[02:10:22.349 --> 02:10:27.835]  And the thing that's so great about him, because now people will look at him and say he's a nutcase.
[02:10:27.895 --> 02:10:29.597]  But see, I don't think so.
[02:10:30.518 --> 02:10:31.399]  I don't think so.
[02:10:31.439 --> 02:10:32.780]  He's a nonconformist.
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:33.521]  He's a nonconformist.
[02:10:33.541 --> 02:10:39.426]  He goes around the country with a bullhorn, like to UCLA or wherever he wants, and he says, 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:10:39.446 --> 02:10:41.287]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:10:41.548 --> 02:10:49.054]  And within five or ten minutes, the police show up, and his friends videotape him getting arrested by the police, and boy, does it annoy people, I can tell you that much.
[02:10:49.094 --> 02:10:51.496]  That would probably annoy just a handful of people.
[02:10:51.576 --> 02:10:53.818]  Well, you've got to look and then make your own decision.
[02:10:53.878 --> 02:10:54.339]  Exactly.
[02:10:54.399 --> 02:10:55.460]  I'm going to check it out for sure.
[02:10:56.630 --> 02:10:58.972]  So she says, you go look and then make your own decision.
[02:10:59.553 --> 02:11:05.098]  On a show with conservatively, sometimes it's 20 million, but normally it's about 15, 16 mil a morning.
[02:11:05.959 --> 02:11:07.461]  Millions watching at one time.
[02:11:09.122 --> 02:11:12.345]  Repeatedly now, more and more guests are going, hey, go to this 9-11 truth site.
[02:11:12.365 --> 02:11:12.706]  Hey!
[02:11:13.366 --> 02:11:19.993]  So they can't come out themselves, but they're plugging others that are doing this.
[02:11:21.457 --> 02:11:26.159]  And I got a bunch of stupid, I don't know, about two or three stupid emails going, What are you doing promoting John Connor?
[02:11:26.759 --> 02:11:28.319]  Don't you see he's going to take over?
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:30.560]  He's going to be the big guy and not you.
[02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:32.181]  I certainly hope so.
[02:11:32.221 --> 02:11:34.562]  I've got some fishing trips I want to go on.
[02:11:35.262 --> 02:11:36.882]  Folks, you understand, I'm trying to survive here.
[02:11:36.902 --> 02:11:38.703]  I'm trying to save the country and the world.
[02:11:39.643 --> 02:11:41.884]  And that's what hurts people in the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:11:41.904 --> 02:11:43.925]  That's why so many of them are not effective.
[02:11:44.005 --> 02:11:46.666]  They don't understand rising tides raise all ships.
[02:11:47.586 --> 02:11:59.250]  Yeah, when I try to bring more shows over to this network, or when I tell Ted Anderson, hey, you ought to get John Connor or other people, my show is streamed 24 hours a day over at Infowars.com.
[02:11:59.270 --> 02:12:01.111]  Why would I want more competition to myself?
[02:12:01.471 --> 02:12:03.332]  It isn't competition to Alex Jones.
[02:12:03.672 --> 02:12:05.973]  It isn't about my ego.
[02:12:06.453 --> 02:12:09.894]  Every day I put clips of other people fighting the globalists on my websites.
[02:12:10.375 --> 02:12:12.275]  I'm not Rush Limbaugh or somebody, folks.
[02:12:12.575 --> 02:12:13.556]  I want to win!
[02:12:14.542 --> 02:12:16.882]  And I work with people who I've watched for years.
[02:12:16.922 --> 02:12:19.563]  I've been watching Connor, I guess, for about two years.
[02:12:20.363 --> 02:12:22.123]  I've been watching Tarpley for about ten.
[02:12:22.804 --> 02:12:24.764]  I've been watching a lot of these other people.
[02:12:25.664 --> 02:12:35.826]  And if somebody has the same goals as Defeat Tyranny, wants to promote other people, wants to get synergy going, wants to combine our forces, then I get behind them.
[02:12:36.266 --> 02:12:40.047]  And I am just so glad that John, every week now, is making national headlines.
[02:12:40.487 --> 02:12:41.147]  He's got a degree.
[02:12:42.092 --> 02:12:43.033]  We're good to go.
[02:13:05.050 --> 02:13:23.119]  I would say, first of all, we should all congratulate ourselves, and above all you, that it was those C-SPAN broadcasts, the four broadcasts at the end of July and the beginning of August, that essentially set the stage for the defeat of the war party and the pro-Bush candidates in the November election.
[02:13:23.499 --> 02:13:29.322]  The Democratic Party did everything they could to lose that election, and since they won it, they've done everything they could to throw it away.
[02:13:30.083 --> 02:13:33.264]  So I think that is simply a historical fact.
[02:13:33.785 --> 02:13:36.606]  Bush had played the terror card successfully in 2002, 2004.
[02:13:38.086 --> 02:13:51.372]  He and Rove thought they could play it again in 2006, but this time the emperor had no clothes because simply the demagogy of terror, this nightmare vision that he's been trying to sell and had sold successfully in the past, this simply didn't work anymore.
[02:13:51.732 --> 02:13:58.755]  And I think that Rove and company were sincerely surprised that the usual 9-11 scare routine did not work.
[02:13:58.855 --> 02:13:58.995]  Now,
[02:13:59.545 --> 02:14:08.311]  As you point out, the Hollywood community, celebrities, television people, are a very important means of breaking through in mass consciousness.
[02:14:08.351 --> 02:14:10.293]  We have about 80% of the U.S.
[02:14:10.893 --> 02:14:26.424]  population that don't believe in the official story, but on the other hand, the institutions, be they academia, the media, the networks, and the political parties above all, they are all still wedded to this lunatic myth of 9-11, right?
[02:14:26.444 --> 02:14:28.145]  The story with Atta and Al-Qaeda.
[02:14:28.837 --> 02:14:43.489]  And most importantly, this is now being used to prepare a regional war in the Middle East, a much wider war with a nuclear attack on Iran, which would break the nuclear taboo that we've had since Hiroshima and Nagasaki worldwide.
[02:14:44.049 --> 02:14:48.453]  And then on top of that, it's going to go towards a third world war, and that would be the Putin speech.
[02:14:48.993 --> 02:14:51.896]  Let me just try to situate us right now where we are.
[02:14:52.676 --> 02:14:58.001]  I'm looking at Zbigniew Brzezinski's testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 1st
[02:14:59.093 --> 02:15:07.140]  Where he warns that we are now on a downhill track for a head-on conflict with Iran and much of the world of Islam at large.
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:12.825]  It would be a war embracing Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, in his view.
[02:15:13.025 --> 02:15:19.271]  And we've got the carriers there, we've got them claiming that Iran's supplying weapons, clearly getting ready for the kick-off.
[02:15:19.291 --> 02:15:21.152]  We've got the entire media build-up.
[02:15:21.232 --> 02:15:23.815]  Now, he goes through what he calls a plausible scenario.
[02:15:24.491 --> 02:15:25.892]  This is Bignor Brzezinski.
[02:15:26.393 --> 02:15:28.254]  This is a criminal in his own right.
[02:15:28.334 --> 02:15:30.736]  He's just a criminal of a slightly different branch.
[02:15:30.876 --> 02:15:33.058]  And he wrote Between Two Ages.
[02:15:33.138 --> 02:15:39.522]  He's a founder of the Trilateral Commission, National Security Advisor Jimmy Carter, and he's now saying they may stage terror.
[02:15:39.783 --> 02:15:40.583]  What does that mean?
[02:15:40.663 --> 02:15:41.644]  Is that a major split?
[02:15:41.684 --> 02:15:48.389]  Let me go through it just so people get the exact quote, so they can see exactly what he says, because I think this is absolutely critical also for people to be able to intervene with.
[02:15:48.850 --> 02:15:50.711]  The plausible scenario is, first of all,
[02:15:51.559 --> 02:15:53.941]  Iraq will fail to meet the benchmark.
[02:15:53.961 --> 02:15:55.782]  So Iraq failure is there every day.
[02:15:55.842 --> 02:15:56.522]  That's number one.
[02:15:56.903 --> 02:16:02.346]  The second is accusations from Bush of Iranian responsibility for the failure.
[02:16:02.406 --> 02:16:05.268]  We had that now yesterday morning in Baghdad.
[02:16:05.328 --> 02:16:10.052]  A bunch of nonsense was brought forward by people who would not even identify themselves, right?
[02:16:11.188 --> 02:16:18.029]  RPGs found in a hollow tree or something like this, which they said prove that Iran is actively intervening.
[02:16:18.329 --> 02:16:24.290]  The story is completely filled with contradictions and nonsense, but let's just disregard that for the moment.
[02:16:24.710 --> 02:16:37.573]  The third one, and this is the one we're at now, culminating in a provocation in Iraq or a terrorist act in the United States blamed on Iran.
[02:16:37.593 --> 02:16:38.913]  Now that's the one to focus on.
[02:16:39.372 --> 02:16:47.877]  He says, the scenario involves, and then he goes through these things, a terrorist act in the United States blamed on Iran.
[02:16:48.377 --> 02:16:50.059]  That is the point we have now reached.
[02:16:50.119 --> 02:16:52.160]  And then it culminates in a defensive U.S.
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:57.263]  military action against Iran that starts this war with Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan.
[02:16:58.076 --> 02:17:03.601]  Why is a heavy hitter insider like him going public and openly warning a false flag?
[02:17:04.001 --> 02:17:08.025]  I think Brzezinski is always associated with the hatred of Russia.
[02:17:08.925 --> 02:17:11.067]  His ruling passion is the hatred of Russia.
[02:17:11.548 --> 02:17:16.772]  And he, along with Richard Holbrooke and others on the Democratic side, rather than the neocons,
[02:17:17.287 --> 02:17:21.209]  They have a kind of factional division against the neocons.
[02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:27.573]  And they see the Iran strike strengthening Russia and China in their agreements.
[02:17:28.414 --> 02:17:31.336]  They see that it's going to weaken the U.S., that the U.S.
[02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:32.877]  will be defeated in this, right?
[02:17:32.957 --> 02:17:33.457]  Stay there.
[02:17:33.517 --> 02:17:34.578]  Let's talk about it.
[02:17:34.878 --> 02:17:36.379]  Yeah, this happened last week.
[02:17:36.459 --> 02:17:37.460]  It's gotten little notice.
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:39.601]  Brzezinski talking about false flags.
[02:17:41.261 --> 02:17:41.902]  We're good to go.
[02:18:04.997 --> 02:18:14.738]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:18:14.858 --> 02:18:23.720]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.281]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:18:29.562 --> 02:18:31.305]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:18:31.426 --> 02:18:31.666]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:42.646 --> 02:18:43.687]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:44.087 --> 02:18:49.589]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.650]  That's right.
[02:18:50.970 --> 02:18:53.251]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:54.652 --> 02:19:00.735]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:01.295 --> 02:19:08.997]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:09.437 --> 02:19:14.278]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:14.918 --> 02:19:19.919]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:20.719 --> 02:19:24.840]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:27.424]  Call 800-686-2237 Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:27.504 --> 02:19:28.366]  Call 800-686-2237 That's 1-800-686-2237
[02:19:40.903 --> 02:19:43.424]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:43.444 --> 02:19:50.507]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[02:19:51.248 --> 02:19:56.870]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[02:19:57.210 --> 02:20:08.955]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.

[02:22:11.664 --> 02:22:22.673]  There is no way in words and vocabulary in my semantical lexicon that I have to describe to you the perilous times we're in.
[02:22:23.494 --> 02:22:25.655]  We're on the razor's edge right now.
[02:22:26.256 --> 02:22:37.325]  The globalists, the neocon, Anglo-American faction is openly wanting to go from one Ponzi scheme, Iraq, and escalate it into the mother of scams,
[02:22:38.311 --> 02:22:49.494]  A huge military combined bombardment of the entire infrastructure, and that's now official from the State Department, attack on Iran, that will cause all sorts of economic problems, military problems.
[02:22:49.734 --> 02:22:54.235]  I want Webster to walk through some of the things that may cause, but let's get back to this.
[02:22:54.635 --> 02:22:58.236]  We've got all these carrier task force groups and other attack groups ready.
[02:22:58.796 --> 02:23:03.217]  We've got them claiming that they're supplying the weapons, the same New York Times spook,
[02:23:03.877 --> 02:23:04.918]  Break this down for us.
[02:23:27.293 --> 02:23:34.379]  Well, I think we have to take a look at Brzezinski's testimony to the Center for Foreign Relations Committee on February 1st and just take a step back.
[02:23:34.419 --> 02:23:39.743]  He says there's going to be a terrorist act in the United States and it's going to be blamed on Iran.
[02:23:40.443 --> 02:23:51.052]  Now, the whole purpose of the 9-11 Truth Movement, we have to understand what happened on September 11, 2001, because this is a technique that is always in danger of being repeated.
[02:23:51.492 --> 02:23:53.734]  And we now have the possible repetition of
[02:23:54.181 --> 02:23:54.882]  We're good to go.
[02:23:54.902 --> 02:23:55.742]  We're good to go.
[02:24:23.556 --> 02:24:25.457]  And Israel's security needs.
[02:24:25.738 --> 02:24:27.119]  He has a lot of contempt for Ms.
[02:24:27.199 --> 02:24:32.703]  Rice at the State Department because she, of course, is an incompetent, and he can see that well enough.
[02:24:33.023 --> 02:24:38.587]  But the important thing for us is a terrorist act in the United States blamed on Iran, says Brzezinski.
[02:24:39.287 --> 02:24:41.429]  Now, this, I think, is the critical thing.
[02:24:41.729 --> 02:24:43.130]  And he says blamed.
[02:24:43.210 --> 02:24:45.012]  I mean, he's saying it's going to be staged.
[02:24:45.132 --> 02:24:46.312]  Now, he has been asked.
[02:24:46.352 --> 02:24:52.497]  Journalists have tried to pin him down a little bit more on this, and he's slithered away because he's not going to go any much further than this.
[02:24:52.898 --> 02:24:57.780]  But the idea now is, 9-11 truth squads are in action on the campaign trail.
[02:24:58.361 --> 02:25:02.523]  Mrs. Clinton, Obama, Edwards, McCain, Giuliani, Romney.
[02:25:02.943 --> 02:25:07.825]  The big question is not, will you repudiate the Iraq war?
[02:25:07.865 --> 02:25:08.926]  That's, of course, important.
[02:25:09.386 --> 02:25:11.747]  The question is, will you repudiate the Iran war?
[02:25:11.827 --> 02:25:20.531]  And above all, now that Brzezinski has said that a new 9-11 is in preparation with the design of blaming it on Iran...
[02:25:21.187 --> 02:25:22.968]  Will you repudiate that project?
[02:25:23.128 --> 02:25:30.091]  Will you say that you will not believe the story told by the administration, that you will not call for an attack on Iran?
[02:25:30.451 --> 02:25:34.053]  It's clear that Mrs. Clinton is a cheerleader for the attack on Iran.
[02:25:34.073 --> 02:25:40.435]  She talks out of all five sides of her mouth, but she is a warmonger attempting to convince us that she's something else.
[02:25:40.855 --> 02:25:44.377]  The big question is, what is the attitude of these candidates saying?
[02:25:44.679 --> 02:25:50.481]  Towards Brzezinski's warning that a new 9-11 is in the works, and of course it's coming from the U.S.
[02:25:50.541 --> 02:25:54.943]  military security bureaucracy in exactly the same way that the original one did.
[02:25:56.563 --> 02:25:59.064]  And I think that's the thing to go on the campaign trail.
[02:25:59.164 --> 02:26:12.229]  If you're in New Hampshire, if you're in Iowa, if you're in Nevada, if you're in South Carolina, if you're anywhere near any of those places... And let's be clear, we have a chance to stop World War III, the kickoff of something that no doubt will be bigger...
[02:26:13.055 --> 02:26:16.217]  Well, I think the timing is something like February, March, and perhaps at the limit April.
[02:26:41.678 --> 02:26:49.185]  And given the well-known preferences of the U.S., the British, and the Israelis, get out your old Farmer's Almanac.
[02:26:49.225 --> 02:26:50.266]  I've got mine right here.
[02:26:50.826 --> 02:26:53.929]  The new moon is now on the 17th of February.
[02:26:53.949 --> 02:26:55.470]  That's one of them.
[02:26:56.291 --> 02:26:58.733]  And then we've got, and that's just a couple of days away now,
[02:26:59.190 --> 02:27:03.012]  And then we've got the next new moon is on the 18th of March.
[02:27:03.072 --> 02:27:04.333]  Now be clear what that means.
[02:27:04.573 --> 02:27:13.178]  It means that if you're going to attack using stealth bombers and cruise missiles and things like this, you want to do it on a night when there's no moon, when nothing can be seen.
[02:27:13.599 --> 02:27:27.567]  Now this is not an ironclad rule, but one good rule of thumb might be, beware the Ides of March, beware the 15th of March, because that's the immediate day or two before that new moon in March, when it looks like all the assets will be assembled on the scene.
[02:27:28.510 --> 02:27:29.671]  They're lining up for war.
[02:27:29.711 --> 02:27:30.471]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:30.531 --> 02:27:32.012]  Talk about the aftermath if it does happen.
[02:27:34.273 --> 02:27:35.193]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.673 --> 02:27:37.294]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.194 --> 02:27:40.896]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:56.584 --> 02:27:57.284]  We're good.
[02:28:17.193 --> 02:28:18.633]  The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.
[02:28:18.734 --> 02:28:20.994]  That's The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.

[02:28:44.202 --> 02:28:45.923]  Shelly, you look exactly... Oh, wait.
[02:28:46.043 --> 02:28:47.123]  Why did you turn that down?
[02:28:47.143 --> 02:28:49.744]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[02:28:50.224 --> 02:28:54.726]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[02:28:54.886 --> 02:28:57.347]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[02:28:57.607 --> 02:28:58.767]  I think it's something like that.
[02:28:58.887 --> 02:29:01.228]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[02:29:01.348 --> 02:29:04.249]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:06.110]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:08.470]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[02:29:08.851 --> 02:29:09.491]  I guess you're right.
[02:29:09.871 --> 02:29:10.551]  Why don't we try it?
[02:29:10.731 --> 02:29:12.692]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[02:29:13.112 --> 02:29:17.514]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[02:29:17.815 --> 02:29:19.175]  I know where we can get some more information.
[02:29:19.556 --> 02:29:23.938]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[02:29:24.178 --> 02:29:27.460]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[02:29:32.323 --> 02:29:33.583]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[02:29:33.783 --> 02:29:35.064]  The BedFan is the answer.

[02:29:45.293 --> 02:29:47.095]  Government is best which governs least.
[02:29:47.175 --> 02:29:48.457]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:29:48.657 --> 02:29:51.480]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:29:51.861 --> 02:29:54.584]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:29:55.091 --> 02:29:55.812]  We're good to go.

[02:30:41.855 --> 02:30:46.985]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:47.686 --> 02:30:49.990]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:57.248 --> 02:31:00.430]  We'll be taking some calls for Webster Tarpley coming up in about 10 minutes.
[02:31:00.531 --> 02:31:02.792]  Fred George and others that are holding just for him will get to you.

[02:31:08.897 --> 02:31:10.538]  Don't forget, I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[02:31:10.558 --> 02:31:11.619]  I've made 15 films.
[02:31:11.659 --> 02:31:15.602]  The latest is Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:31:15.942 --> 02:31:18.224]  The first 30 minutes of the roughly two-hour film...
[02:31:18.744 --> 02:31:26.237]  It's just admissions by this government of terror attacks they've staged to blame on foreign governments or bring down governments.
[02:31:26.357 --> 02:31:27.619]  It's declassified.
[02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:29.350]  We're good to go.
[02:31:29.370 --> 02:31:29.630]  I think?
[02:31:51.127 --> 02:31:51.788]  We're good to go.
[02:31:51.848 --> 02:31:52.589]  We're good to go.
[02:32:11.844 --> 02:32:12.765]  We're called till free.
[02:32:13.085 --> 02:32:15.887]  And ask about the discounts and specials and combos.

[02:32:16.367 --> 02:32:17.708]  And don't forget prisonplanet.tv.
[02:32:17.748 --> 02:32:19.990]  All my films, my weekly TV reports, special reports.
[02:32:29.651 --> 02:32:30.972]  Thousands of pieces of media.
[02:32:31.072 --> 02:32:33.535]  Third year anniversary coming up on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:32:33.555 --> 02:32:39.300]  And I do want to thank all the members out there that are members who are busy, by the way, right now, even upgrading it and beefing it up even more.
[02:32:40.201 --> 02:32:42.143]  Going back to Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[02:32:43.217 --> 02:32:45.038]  Webster, I mean, this is surreal.
[02:32:45.078 --> 02:32:45.979]  We're sitting here.
[02:32:46.099 --> 02:32:54.485]  We've been put into a war based on frauds and lies, designed to fall apart, designed to widen into a larger conflict.
[02:32:54.965 --> 02:32:56.946]  They're openly talking about attacking Iran.
[02:32:57.286 --> 02:33:02.970]  Special Forces troops have been in Iran for two and a half years, staging events and preparing targets.
[02:33:03.371 --> 02:33:06.813]  They've got the huge military buildup basically complete.
[02:33:07.133 --> 02:33:08.954]  They're openly saying they've got to be hit.
[02:33:09.355 --> 02:33:13.017]  They've pulled out the stops with the Propaganda Bureau saying prepare for the attack.
[02:33:14.737 --> 02:33:18.639]  And then you've got 78% of Americans in major polls against it.
[02:33:19.199 --> 02:33:20.539]  The troops are falling apart.
[02:33:20.879 --> 02:33:22.940]  The surge is a joke.
[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:25.000]  And it looks like they're just going to do it.
[02:33:25.321 --> 02:33:29.362]  What do you see happening in the aftermath if we can't stop it and they do do it?
[02:33:29.802 --> 02:33:40.485]  And then I add the caveat, having people like Brzezinski and others come out against it, clearly insiders, does that signify the split in the New World Order is big enough to where they may not allow them to go forward?
[02:33:41.032 --> 02:33:42.493]  I think there is a split in the U.S.
[02:33:42.533 --> 02:33:52.522]  ruling class between a moderate imperialist group around Baker and the Democratic Party, including Brzezinski, Holbrooke, and some others, and an extreme imperialist group.
[02:33:52.542 --> 02:34:03.592]  These are the neocon fascist madmen, the all-out warmongers, the ones who see the U.S., Britain, and Israel as at endless war with the entire rest of the planet.
[02:34:04.156 --> 02:34:10.262]  In the short term, the Iranian retaliation has obviously blocked the Gulf, blocked the Straits of Hormuz.
[02:34:10.302 --> 02:34:12.744]  That means no supplies reach the U.S.
[02:34:12.804 --> 02:34:13.705]  forces in Iraq.
[02:34:13.865 --> 02:34:15.447]  They are threatened with being wiped out.
[02:34:15.927 --> 02:34:17.809]  No oil gets to the world market.
[02:34:18.229 --> 02:34:26.777]  Minus 30 to 40% of the world oil supply, world economic depression, medium-range missiles rain down on Saudi Arabia, U.S.
[02:34:26.858 --> 02:34:28.919]  bases, Israel, you name it.
[02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:29.240]  But then...
[02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:30.788]  There's something even worse.
[02:34:31.028 --> 02:34:32.088]  That's just for starters.
[02:34:32.349 --> 02:34:33.549]  And this gets us to Putin.
[02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:37.832]  If you're going to bomb Iran, you're going to kill Russians in the Boucher reactor.
[02:34:37.892 --> 02:34:41.895]  You're going to kill Chinese in the oil industry because of their interest there.
[02:34:42.195 --> 02:34:44.296]  You're going to be on the slide to World War III.
[02:34:44.736 --> 02:34:46.177]  And here's where Putin comes in.
[02:34:46.197 --> 02:34:48.098]  And Putin gave a speech saying that.
[02:34:48.439 --> 02:34:51.981]  Putin's speech at the Wehrkunde Gesellschaft in Munich.
[02:34:52.041 --> 02:34:55.283]  It's the yearly gathering of all the strategic experts.
[02:34:55.323 --> 02:34:58.785]  This was where, for example, Rumsfeld shot his mouth off about old Europe.
[02:34:59.266 --> 02:34:59.926]  Some years ago.
[02:34:59.987 --> 02:35:00.827]  They all go to it.
[02:35:00.867 --> 02:35:01.728]  Gates was there.
[02:35:02.648 --> 02:35:08.532]  We had the Lieberman there, McCain there, Larry Johnny of Iran, the whole European crew, the Japanese.
[02:35:08.952 --> 02:35:12.735]  So this is now Putin, and I think this is a public service by Putin.
[02:35:12.775 --> 02:35:14.896]  He is essentially delivering a war warning.
[02:35:15.397 --> 02:35:17.118]  He is essentially saying to the U.S.
[02:35:17.278 --> 02:35:22.381]  and the British and the Israelis, stop, pull back, or you will be on the slide to World War III.
[02:35:22.421 --> 02:35:28.145]  Now, how he says it, he says, we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper-use of force
[02:35:28.715 --> 02:35:30.576]  In all of international relations.
[02:35:31.217 --> 02:35:36.381]  One state, the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way.
[02:35:36.921 --> 02:35:43.466]  This is nourishing an arms race with the desire of countries to get nuclear weapons.
[02:35:43.866 --> 02:35:52.112]  He essentially says that the world is now more dangerous, that world peace is more threatened than it ever was at the height of the Cold War.
[02:35:52.512 --> 02:35:56.615]  He says, among other things, that Star Wars anti-missile technology is
[02:35:57.610 --> 02:35:57.991]  Is here.
[02:35:58.331 --> 02:35:59.553]  It's being used everywhere.
[02:35:59.573 --> 02:36:07.583]  And of course, this seems to be the key to the Chinese shooting down of a satellite one day after Bush's escalation speech back on the 11th of...
[02:36:09.196 --> 02:36:10.116]  Of January.
[02:36:10.476 --> 02:36:16.958]  Putin is very concerned about the fact that NATO is trying to spread itself into Ukraine and similar places.
[02:36:17.318 --> 02:36:21.399]  This violates assurances that were given back at the end of the Cold War.
[02:36:21.799 --> 02:36:29.101]  He's concerned about subversion through NGOs, through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
[02:36:29.561 --> 02:36:33.142]  And then he talks about essentially the neocon worldview.
[02:36:33.462 --> 02:36:36.043]  He says their view is the unipolar world.
[02:36:36.739 --> 02:36:46.407]  One single center of power, one single center of force, one single center of decision-making, a world of one master, one sovereign.
[02:36:46.647 --> 02:36:52.132]  But then he hurries to point out, saying, this does not benefit the master and the sovereign, as we well know here.
[02:36:52.512 --> 02:36:54.814]  We're inside the master and the sovereign.
[02:36:55.274 --> 02:36:59.158]  And he says, this destroys the master from the inside.
[02:36:59.238 --> 02:37:01.199]  So it's no good for anybody.
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:02.000]  The U.S.
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:04.422]  actions are unilateral, illegitimate.
[02:37:04.873 --> 02:37:05.914]  I agree with that, says Putin.
[02:37:05.974 --> 02:37:06.154]  So...
[02:37:34.658 --> 02:37:35.742]  And if you listen to what his
[02:37:40.359 --> 02:37:46.562]  To the leaders of the Western military establishments above all the United States, to stop and think.
[02:37:48.563 --> 02:37:49.823]  That's what their foreign minister said.
[02:37:50.164 --> 02:37:51.744]  Now, let's expand on this.
[02:37:52.285 --> 02:37:56.787]  You've got Brzezinski, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who hates the Russians, saying, don't go to war.
[02:37:57.307 --> 02:38:05.691]  And the guy who created the Mujahideen to first attack the Russians, and he's now written a book about it last year, to sucker them into invading.
[02:38:06.131 --> 02:38:07.371]  Now he's saying, don't do it.
[02:38:07.431 --> 02:38:08.272]  On the other side...
[02:38:09.292 --> 02:38:10.994]  Putin is saying don't do it.
[02:38:11.014 --> 02:38:14.876]  We've got a lot of the European banking side saying don't do it.
[02:38:14.996 --> 02:38:19.839]  Clearly the old line thinks this is a crisis so big they can't control it.
[02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:22.701]  Yes, and I think that's where we come in, of course.
[02:38:22.761 --> 02:38:30.667]  Again, I've suggested 9-11 truth squads have to intervene in all the early primary action, wherever these candidates show their faces.
[02:38:31.167 --> 02:38:38.452]  And the question is, what do you say to Zbigniew Brzezinski's warning that there's going to be a new fake 9-11 and that's going to be the basis,
[02:38:38.891 --> 02:38:43.735]  For a nuclear sneak attack on Iran, and that's going to be essentially the end of the world as we've known it.
[02:38:44.236 --> 02:38:49.760]  The other thing I would suggest is people have got to get into the streets.
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:52.443]  We had a peace demonstration here on January 27th.
[02:38:53.303 --> 02:38:57.687]  United for Peace and Justice banned all 9-11 truth speakers from being there.
[02:38:58.168 --> 02:39:00.930]  They persecuted 9-11 truth people at their homes.
[02:39:01.195 --> 02:39:03.036]  Noam Chomsky and all of them.
[02:39:03.136 --> 02:39:05.478]  I want to talk about Noam for a minute.
[02:39:05.518 --> 02:39:08.719]  I spoke to about 900 people at UT, turned away 100.
[02:39:08.839 --> 02:39:10.280]  The hall only held 900.
[02:39:27.350 --> 02:39:32.012]  A few weeks ago, and at the end of it, a guy walked up and said, How dare you say that Noam Chomsky's controlled?
[02:39:32.032 --> 02:39:33.733]  How dare you say he's not wonderful?
[02:39:34.173 --> 02:39:36.595]  And I explained he was MIT Defense Department funded.
[02:39:36.615 --> 02:39:39.376]  I explained that he only tells people half the story.
[02:39:39.416 --> 02:39:42.978]  I explained that he said in a clip, Who cares if 9-11 was the government?
[02:39:42.998 --> 02:39:43.638]  It doesn't matter.
[02:39:43.698 --> 02:39:44.739]  By the way, we have that clip.
[02:39:44.759 --> 02:39:46.279]  We've played it about five times.
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:48.100]  And the guy just said, No, you're a liar.
[02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:53.203]  Can you speak to the people that think that Noam Chomsky is the end-all, be-all, and tell people what he really is?
[02:39:53.883 --> 02:40:05.713]  I think Noam Chomsky embodies the absolute impotence and absolute lack of effectiveness of a fake, kept left-wing opposition that has been able to accomplish nothing.
[02:40:06.340 --> 02:40:07.200]  In 30 years.
[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:11.302]  It's essentially a figure of disorientation, demoralization.
[02:40:11.422 --> 02:40:16.984]  And now they're upset that conservatives, liberals, libertarians are coming together under 9-11 truth.
[02:40:17.044 --> 02:40:19.445]  As we said, it is the make it or break it issue.
[02:40:19.725 --> 02:40:22.186]  It is the foundation of globalist hegemon.
[02:40:22.486 --> 02:40:24.507]  And we're actually having an effect.
[02:40:24.967 --> 02:40:27.408]  And they have speeches at UT every week.
[02:40:27.768 --> 02:40:29.829]  They have speeches around the country, and guess who they attack?
[02:40:29.849 --> 02:40:30.730]  9-11 Truth.
[02:40:30.970 --> 02:40:33.471]  They say, we're bad, and we're a threat.
[02:40:33.731 --> 02:40:35.652]  And they basically say there's no ruling class.
[02:40:35.672 --> 02:40:37.493]  I mean, how ridiculous.
[02:40:37.533 --> 02:40:45.396]  The tragedy of liberalism is precisely that liberalism means that you think that financiers and bankers should run the world.
[02:40:45.897 --> 02:40:56.922]  And they've never been able to break with this, and it extends to Amy Goodman of Democracy Now!, The Nation magazine, and a whole stable of left liberal, radical liberal pseudo-intellectuals
[02:40:57.458 --> 02:41:00.360]  Who have all struck out, and they have nothing useful to say right now.
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:04.683]  All they ever call for is a centralization of power, and those centralized levers have been used.
[02:41:06.285 --> 02:41:08.526]  I mean, they are in the dustbin of history right now.
[02:41:09.027 --> 02:41:14.751]  What has to happen, though, is that the left liberal mentality is extremely suggestible.
[02:41:14.791 --> 02:41:21.396]  In other words, the fact that these are so-called respected and well-established people seems to mean something to the left liberal mind.
[02:41:21.476 --> 02:41:23.237]  I urge people, turn away from these people.
[02:41:23.918 --> 02:41:26.740]  They are not calling for mobilization right now in any sense.
[02:41:27.082 --> 02:41:28.603]  What you've got to do is get out and mobilize.
[02:41:28.643 --> 02:41:33.947]  For example, some of us here want to start going to Lafayette Park at the White House every Saturday.
[02:41:33.987 --> 02:41:39.191]  I hope we'll be there Saturday at noon, this coming Saturday at noon at Lafayette Park, right across from the White House.
[02:41:39.552 --> 02:41:47.297]  And we're going to be there every Saturday during the war emergency, as long as we're on the brink of the attack on Iran and as long as we're on the brink of a new 9-11.
[02:41:48.243 --> 02:41:51.366]  We've got to get out there and essentially bring that message home to people.
[02:41:51.386 --> 02:41:52.186]  Now let's be clear.
[02:41:52.407 --> 02:42:04.877]  Brzezinski, on record, in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee February 1st, comes out and says there may be a staged attack in this country blamed on Iran as the kickoff.
[02:42:05.417 --> 02:42:16.526]  Folks, it is happening, and it shows people inside the system are scared if they're letting their mouthpieces like Rosie and others every week now shoot their mouth off about 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:42:16.867 --> 02:42:23.992]  This shows major fissures in the unification of the power structure that we need to use 110%.
[02:42:24.593 --> 02:42:28.316]  We need to put our crowbars in there and break it open.
[02:42:29.082 --> 02:42:35.368]  And it also shows that if you don't address 9-11 truth, you cannot effectively oppose the war policy.
[02:42:35.428 --> 02:42:41.133]  Why do you think Brzezinski, have you heard the clip at a university a few months ago where he says, oh, so what if it's an inside job, it doesn't matter?
[02:42:42.014 --> 02:42:45.137]  Well, of course, he's a cynical figure of the ruling class.
[02:42:45.157 --> 02:42:46.458]  But I think he slipped up there.
[02:42:47.219 --> 02:42:48.040]  Could very well be.
[02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:51.923]  He's somebody with, let's say, he's got deep mental problems of his own.
[02:42:52.224 --> 02:42:54.746]  But in this case, he has performed a public service, once again.
[02:42:55.208 --> 02:43:00.712]  In the sense that he has warned that there's a new 9-11 coming, and it's going to be used as the pretext for the attack on Iran.
[02:43:01.092 --> 02:43:01.972]  And that is the thing.
[02:43:02.133 --> 02:43:09.898]  There is the big chink in the armor, I think, of the ruling class argument right now, because they're preparing a new 9-11.
[02:43:10.298 --> 02:43:11.839]  And here it's been told in advance.
[02:43:11.859 --> 02:43:16.422]  But the idea now is to raise hell around this issue.
[02:43:16.482 --> 02:43:21.405]  In other words, to put this on the front page and the top story of every broadcaster
[02:43:21.818 --> 02:43:26.802]  And no candidate for president should be able to show his or her face without answering that question.
[02:43:27.082 --> 02:43:28.764]  What are you going to do to stop... And we're seeing that.
[02:43:28.824 --> 02:43:34.188]  More and more town halls, more and more speeches from congressmen and women up to presidential candidates.
[02:43:34.548 --> 02:43:35.989]  People are confronting them.
[02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:42.074]  When Ashcroft goes to events, back when he was Attorney General, 9-11, inside jobs being brought up.
[02:43:42.374 --> 02:43:44.416]  People should be going anywhere and everywhere.
[02:43:44.736 --> 02:43:46.978]  And picture this New World Order as a big dragon...
[02:43:48.079 --> 02:43:54.004]  Stomping forward against free societies, it's missing a lot of its armored scales on its chest and belly.
[02:43:54.464 --> 02:44:08.897]  And instead of waiting for some leader like Webster Tarpley or Alex Jones to fire black arrows into its chest, we all need to just start firing arrows and quit talking about the size of the thing and quit talking about how tough it is and just start firing!
[02:44:10.078 --> 02:44:14.462]  And I would also urge people, after you've heard this broadcast, once this broadcast is off the air,
[02:44:14.901 --> 02:44:29.326]  Tune your dial around to one of those odious pro-administration radio shows, you know the ones, and call in and bust up the sanctum sanctorum of some of these lunatics who obviously live in a complete dream world and confront them with the fact that...
[02:44:29.679 --> 02:44:38.565]  Not only is the attack on Iran in the final stages of preparation, but it's going to be launched under the cover of a new fake 9-11 or a new fake Gulf War.
[02:44:38.625 --> 02:44:43.048]  Okay, I want to take a few calls here from Fred and George, at least, because they want to talk to you specifically.
[02:44:43.068 --> 02:44:45.169]  We've only got about ten minutes left in transmission time.
[02:44:45.609 --> 02:44:46.990]  But I want to be clear on this.
[02:44:47.351 --> 02:44:50.393]  They could launch the attack tomorrow, a month from now, two months from now.
[02:44:50.433 --> 02:44:52.394]  They openly are saying they plan to do it.
[02:44:53.172 --> 02:44:54.653]  I would have a mobilization plan of our own.
[02:44:54.753 --> 02:44:55.374]  What we've done here...
[02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:21.681]  The DC 9-11 Truth Group has a plan.
[02:45:22.041 --> 02:45:28.585]  If the war starts, we all go to Lafayette Park and we mind a demonstration without anybody telling us what to do.
[02:45:28.605 --> 02:45:29.325]  A little bit like these...
[02:45:29.778 --> 02:45:32.080]  The biggest spontaneous demonstration you can have
[02:45:53.061 --> 02:45:56.282]  I also, I believe very much in... People shouldn't go to work.
[02:45:56.302 --> 02:45:57.943]  People shouldn't go to work either that week.
[02:45:58.563 --> 02:46:00.824]  Well, the goal is to have a general strike.
[02:46:01.584 --> 02:46:09.147]  Ultimately, the only adequate response to such a monstrosity as a new 9-11 and an attack on Iran is to have a general strike.
[02:46:09.547 --> 02:46:10.027]  And therefore...
[02:46:11.256 --> 02:46:13.597]  Set up something where you start going, you know, every week.
[02:46:13.677 --> 02:46:15.359]  It could be Saturday, it could be Sunday.
[02:46:15.379 --> 02:46:16.559]  Well, we do that here in Austin.
[02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:20.602]  Every week people go down for 9-11 Truth, every Saturday at the Texas Capitol.
[02:46:20.622 --> 02:46:21.683]  It gets a lot of attention.
[02:46:21.783 --> 02:46:28.068]  And every other fake anti-war march, 9-11 Truth ends up leading it, getting more news attention.
[02:46:29.028 --> 02:46:33.671]  The key here is to realize, folks, that the establishment is now getting scared.
[02:46:33.691 --> 02:46:40.076]  When 84% believe they're being lied to on 9-11, that's the new numbers, it's exponentially growing.
[02:46:41.297 --> 02:46:42.578]  This is amazing, Webster.
[02:46:42.618 --> 02:46:50.563]  I mean, we really are, because of the people taking action, changing the world, if we redouble our efforts at the organic level, it can't be stopped.
[02:46:51.244 --> 02:46:56.828]  I would also say the Putin speech is conclusive proof to anybody.
[02:46:57.128 --> 02:46:58.409]  If people are in the military...
[02:46:59.396 --> 02:47:12.303]  If people are in government, it essentially says, this is not simply a Middle East regional war, bad as that is, but Putin has now put you on notice that you're in effect courting thermonuclear World War III.
[02:47:12.323 --> 02:47:18.146]  In other words, the day after, the H-bombs on your head as a result of all this.
[02:47:18.226 --> 02:47:20.007]  It's not something over there anymore.
[02:47:20.347 --> 02:47:22.108]  It's something that's coming closer and closer.
[02:47:23.329 --> 02:47:25.690]  But the neocons have to know that's what they're doing.
[02:47:25.730 --> 02:47:28.492]  In fact, in the PNAC strategy, it is meant to widen.
[02:47:29.329 --> 02:47:30.449]  It is meant to go global.
[02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:32.730]  I mean, this is literally Hitler turning east.
[02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:34.991]  This is Hitler attacking everybody at once.
[02:47:35.051 --> 02:47:36.532]  It's just a lust for blood.
[02:47:36.692 --> 02:47:44.555]  And it's similar to the mentality of Hitler around the time of Stalingrad, the retreat into the dream world, the increasing denial of reality.
[02:47:44.775 --> 02:47:45.915]  We're good to go.
[02:47:45.935 --> 02:47:46.316]  I think?
[02:48:07.703 --> 02:48:11.285]  Not a counterattack, and this is similar to the mentality... Led by Himmler.
[02:48:11.926 --> 02:48:15.388]  Over here at the American Enterprise Institute, Frederick Kagan thinks the same thing.
[02:48:15.428 --> 02:48:17.930]  He says, well, there must be divisions to send into Iraq.
[02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.790]  There must be.
[02:48:19.090 --> 02:48:19.731]  There must be.
[02:48:20.819 --> 02:48:23.661]  Well, they plan to set off a nuker bird flu, and then there will be.
[02:48:23.681 --> 02:48:25.041]  There will be a national draft.
[02:48:25.382 --> 02:48:27.963]  Total hell will be released.
[02:48:28.063 --> 02:48:30.405]  And it looks like they're just going to go ahead and put us into it.
[02:48:30.825 --> 02:48:33.166]  We have to fight it as hard as we can and say we did the right thing.
[02:48:33.206 --> 02:48:34.887]  We may be able to stop it with God's grace.
[02:48:35.427 --> 02:48:38.709]  Final segment, we'll talk to Fred and George on the other side and wrap up with Webster.
[02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:39.550]  Griffin Tarpley.
[02:48:44.091 --> 02:48:47.256]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:47.616 --> 02:48:49.539]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:57.551]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:58.248 --> 02:49:05.293]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.693 --> 02:49:17.100]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:21.003]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:21.383 --> 02:49:23.324]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.664 --> 02:49:27.507]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:23.775 --> 02:51:24.335]  We're good to go.
[02:51:49.577 --> 02:51:50.037]  I knew too much.
[02:51:50.078 --> 02:51:50.558]  Welcome back.
[02:52:16.134 --> 02:52:18.575]  Webster, we were talking during the break, and I agree with you.
[02:52:18.615 --> 02:52:27.559]  This is the biggest crisis, I think a much bigger, since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and then the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to stage terror attacks.
[02:52:28.259 --> 02:52:41.445]  I saw a big Mail on Sunday story this weekend about 9-11, and it was basically saying it was an inside job for five pages laying out evidence, but they wrongly said that Kennedy had a plan to stage the Northwoods.
[02:52:41.505 --> 02:52:43.546]  No, Kennedy said no, and they blew his head off.
[02:52:44.266 --> 02:52:48.168]  That was the only part of the story I didn't like, and so they were planning something then.
[02:52:48.569 --> 02:52:50.290]  They're not playing games, are they, Webster?
[02:52:50.830 --> 02:53:04.299]  No, it's the worst intelligence picture that I have ever seen in my life, and that includes, well, I guess it's since the Cuban Missile Crisis of October of 1962, and it is an absolute horror.
[02:53:04.619 --> 02:53:12.764]  And again, it's not just a Middle East regional war, nightmarish as that is, you're talking the Third World War, Russia-China conflict.
[02:53:13.544 --> 02:53:14.024]  And others.
[02:53:14.124 --> 02:53:17.045]  Have you seen how the Democrats have just gone to sleep now?
[02:53:17.285 --> 02:53:20.066]  That is, the constituency is like out for lunch?
[02:53:21.726 --> 02:53:42.832]  Well, the Democratic Party is in many ways a shock absorber for this kind of stuff, and they're doing their job to somehow dissipate a very clear mass response in the election, which was end these wars, not just Iraq, but Afghanistan and Iran, and throw out the global war on terror and throw out Bush's nightmare vision
[02:53:43.425 --> 02:53:46.367]  Of 9-11 and Bin Laden and all the rest of this stuff.
[02:53:46.387 --> 02:53:48.888]  That was the full message of the election.
[02:53:49.028 --> 02:53:50.049]  Let's take two calls.
[02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:52.030]  Fred and Philly and George.
[02:53:52.470 --> 02:53:53.130]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:53:53.150 --> 02:53:56.152]  I see a stage attack first.
[02:53:56.932 --> 02:54:03.156]  And then I see a scenario where communication is said to be down or damaged.
[02:54:03.996 --> 02:54:07.718]  And that will lead to a North American information blockade.
[02:54:08.238 --> 02:54:11.000]  Allow no enemy information or news.
[02:54:11.516 --> 02:54:16.580]  So that Americans won't find out about details of the attack.
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:17.121]  I agree.
[02:54:17.141 --> 02:54:22.986]  They just had an attack on the backbone of the web last week, crippling it, definitely set up by the globalists.
[02:54:23.006 --> 02:54:24.747]  They're saying get ready for the web to go down.
[02:54:25.087 --> 02:54:28.650]  They could easily attack Iran, then stage an attack here and claim Iran did it.
[02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:29.051]  Webster?
[02:54:29.531 --> 02:54:32.614]  I think that's a good reason to have a shortwave radio if you don't have one.
[02:54:33.735 --> 02:54:38.719]  I noticed that the carrier groups, I'm looking at the Junger Welt article of a couple of days ago,
[02:54:39.386 --> 02:54:53.591]  We've got the Eisenhower is there, the Stennis is there, the Ronald Reagan left San Diego on February 3rd, the Bataan passed through the Suez Canal on February 1st, and the Boxer has arrived in Dubai as of the end of January.
[02:54:54.191 --> 02:54:58.212]  The interesting one about the Boxer is that the captain apparently quit on the way.
[02:54:58.273 --> 02:54:59.373]  He didn't want any part of it.
[02:54:59.953 --> 02:55:00.593]  Unbelievable.
[02:55:00.653 --> 02:55:02.414]  George, where are you calling us from?
[02:55:02.434 --> 02:55:03.394]  Anna.
[02:55:03.834 --> 02:55:04.275]  Go ahead.
[02:55:04.735 --> 02:55:06.555]  Yeah, there are two things I want to say.
[02:55:06.595 --> 02:55:08.236]  First of all, Mr. Tarpley, have you...
[02:55:08.737 --> 02:55:09.738]  I actually have the report.
[02:55:09.778 --> 02:55:12.861]  They did find it, but that can come from other sources.
[02:55:12.881 --> 02:55:13.922]  It's inconclusive.
[02:55:13.942 --> 02:55:15.904]  No, I haven't, but here's what I have for you.
[02:55:15.984 --> 02:55:16.164]  Yeah.
[02:55:32.808 --> 02:55:37.369]  If you're in Atlanta, what you've got to do is go to South Carolina and intervene in that primary.
[02:55:37.469 --> 02:55:38.250]  Indiana, brother.
[02:55:38.410 --> 02:55:39.070]  I'm in Indiana.
[02:55:39.210 --> 02:55:39.770]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:40.510 --> 02:55:42.031]  Well, then you've got to go to Iowa.
[02:55:43.231 --> 02:55:43.791]  Hey, Alex?
[02:55:44.131 --> 02:55:44.411]  Yes?
[02:55:44.631 --> 02:55:50.033]  Elizabeth DeLa Vega is a 20-year experience as a federal prosecutor.
[02:55:50.533 --> 02:55:52.134]  If you go to... No, no, we know who she is.
[02:55:52.154 --> 02:55:53.194]  We've got her coming on the show.
[02:55:53.454 --> 02:55:54.854]  Check that indictment she wrote.
[02:55:55.214 --> 02:55:55.595]  Thank you.
[02:55:57.035 --> 02:56:00.556]  We're going to be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central, on the Satellites.
