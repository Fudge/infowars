[00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:06.325]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:08.046]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:09.908]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:11.329]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.990]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.313]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:21.957]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:42.742]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:59.868]  Remember back on Monday, the Sunday Times of London reported that groups were saying it was bad to have babies, and that we should have a one-child policy, basically, and have a carbon tax increase on anyone who has multiple children.
[00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:03.883]  And that's basically the Chinese one-child model.
[00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:14.506]  We are scheduled to have some of the proponents, some of the supporters of this, at least some of the front individuals who support all this, on the show today.
[00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:18.607]  So that is coming up later.
[00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:22.228]  We're also going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:38.256]  Now, a lot of you have emailed and called and posted on the MySpace account and in the message boards that Ron Paul is being censored.
[00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:42.699]  That Ron Paul is being blocked out by the media.
[00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:44.640]  And that is indeed true.
[00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:52.286]  Yahoo has been caught censoring the Congressman, just not even having him in their online vote.
[00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:57.239]  ABC was caught not including him in their online vote, online poll.
[00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:07.064]  MySpace has been confirmed to be blocking most types of posts about the congressman, and videos have been made with screenshots.
[00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:17.770]  You know, while people try to do this in live time, we have tested it, and there is indeed massive, concerted blocking going on.
[00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.250]  And why?
[00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:38.622]  He got to talk a little under six minutes in that debate the other night last week and he trounced the competition and he has won every single online poll and he won the MSNBC poll that night.
[00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:42.944]  Now for the last six months
[00:02:44.443 --> 00:02:57.952]  Four or five months since he's announced, we have seen online polls on literally scores of websites pulled when they did have his name in it because he would win the poll and the corporations would decide to claim, oh, he's not really popular.
[00:02:57.992 --> 00:02:59.313]  That's staged.
[00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:11.842]  So what's happening is you see an establishment desperately trying to block a grassroots candidate who has appealed across the political spectrum for constitutionalist
[00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:19.952]  Second Amendment supporters, anti-war advocates, supporters of smaller government.
[00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:27.577]  He is really the perfect candidate when it comes to his voting record for anyone who is truly a constitutionalist.
[00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:40.147]  But the censorship battle has now been joined and they're really revealing themselves because if he continues to get the spotlight, he's probably going to win the Republican nomination
[00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:58.895]  And all of this rotten barrel of apples, this barrel of rotten apples, the Giulianis and the Mip Romneys and just the entire McCain, the entire gaggle of Keating 5 scam artists and mob bosses and the rest of them.
[00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:01.783]  They're going to lose.
[00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:08.588]  Now, I have some of the polls here in front of me, and this is up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, top story.
[00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:11.990]  I'm asking you to go get this story and get it out to everybody.
[00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.412]  Get it out to mainline, dumbbell conservatives.
[00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:18.054]  And get it out to talk show hosts.
[00:04:18.094 --> 00:04:23.938]  Get it out to everybody, because if we push now, we could really position Congressman Paul
[00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:27.369]  Uh, to force them to steal the election in front of everybody.
[00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.933]  Because they do have their electronic fraud systems in over a third of the nation.
[00:04:31.953 --> 00:04:36.157]  Uh, but still, if someone is so wildly popular, uh, they may have trouble stealing it.
[00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:40.020]  He will trounce Hillary, he will trounce Obama.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.601]  I mean, really, do you want a Hillary?
[00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:44.323]  Clench it, because any of these other Republicans are gonna lose.
[00:04:44.824 --> 00:04:46.605]  They're born to lose, they're designed to lose.
[00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:48.687]  Or do you want Ron Paul?
[00:04:48.847 --> 00:04:51.049]  It's Hillary, Obama, or Ron Paul.
[00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.526]  Okay, now it's that simple.
[00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:57.792]  We're going to get back to tail this and take your call.
[00:04:57.852 --> 00:04:58.293]  Stay with me.
[00:05:01.747 --> 00:05:04.930]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.014]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:11.696]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:05:11.756 --> 00:05:14.098]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:05:14.278 --> 00:05:22.726]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:24.107]  The brookie light is different.
[00:05:24.247 --> 00:05:28.251]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:28.971]  We're good to go!
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.182]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[00:05:54.202 --> 00:05:58.884]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:05:59.044 --> 00:06:00.324]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:06:01.324 --> 00:06:04.786]  It's here.
[00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:09.787]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.147 --> 00:06:17.790]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.487 --> 00:06:25.531]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:37.357]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.657 --> 00:06:41.600]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.581]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:47.743]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:04.367 --> 00:07:05.488]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:07:05.668 --> 00:07:09.809]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:07:10.436 --> 00:07:15.318]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:22.301]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[00:07:23.002 --> 00:07:25.723]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:07:25.863 --> 00:07:30.365]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel,
[00:07:31.005 --> 00:07:35.829]  A 3000 watt peak converter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:07:36.109 --> 00:07:39.792]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:07:39.852 --> 00:07:42.294]  You know, power companies, government, ahem.
[00:07:42.675 --> 00:07:46.358]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:07:46.538 --> 00:07:47.579]  Are you ready to go solar?

[00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:06.597]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:08.338]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:10.179]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.620]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:13.241]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:17.864]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.124 --> 00:08:22.226]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.102 --> 00:08:40.826]  We are now into the second segment of this May 9, 2007 edition.
[00:08:41.446 --> 00:08:42.587]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:42.607 --> 00:08:49.850]  The websites are JonesReport.com, InfoWars.net, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:51.671 --> 00:09:01.076]  Let's get into the big censorship of Congressman Ron Hall, then your calls, and then we have some guests coming up who think we should reduce our population numbers by
[00:09:02.245 --> 00:09:04.405]  Well, some cases over 90 percent.
[00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:12.087]  They debate whether total reduction is needed, that is, extermination of the entire species, or only 80 percent.
[00:09:12.127 --> 00:09:13.147]  It fluctuates.
[00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:17.388]  It runs the gamut there in this movement.
[00:09:17.468 --> 00:09:20.989]  I guess we have some of the moderates coming on today.
[00:09:22.669 --> 00:09:27.790]  Ron Paul, total victory, yet censorship continues.
[00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:31.552]  This is a story from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:32.032 --> 00:09:42.317]  Texas congressman trounces rivals in all polls, but is deliberately pushed to the margins by terrified corporate media.
[00:09:43.738 --> 00:09:51.242]  Another headline we should have would be, only Ron Paul, only Congressman Paul can defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:52.622 --> 00:09:56.444]  Or only Ron Paul can save the Republican Party.
[00:09:57.342 --> 00:10:25.440]  Maybe that would get to the sleeping beauties that are the fake mainline conservatives that were mesmerized and caught under George Bush's stumbling spell and who think that open borders and double the size in federal government spending and BATF giant new compound buildings and crippling their officers and shining onto every UN treaty you can imagine.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.563]  I mean, they really think that's conservative.
[00:10:29.623 --> 00:10:41.964]  They think aggressive wars of aggression against dirt poor third world nations and troops on television bragging about killing whole villages.
[00:10:43.704 --> 00:10:53.710]  And videos being released of contractors just sitting off the side of a highway, machine gunning vehicles full of families and laughing as dead bodies fall out all over the street.
[00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.811]  I mean, that's what the world's been seeing.
[00:10:55.851 --> 00:11:04.276]  And tanks running over family cars as troops laugh and bowl over, you know, grabbing their stomachs in incredible glee and pleasure.
[00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:06.417]  The whole world's just seeing it.
[00:11:07.197 --> 00:11:08.458]  They read private
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:26.029]  Gruckheimer in the Ithaca Journal about how they go in and kill every man, woman, and child and how good it is, and Fox News defending it, and they see Michelle Malkin up there with her wicked stare, talking about the case for internment, let's put everybody, all the Muslims in camps.
[00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:27.549]  Everybody sees it!
[00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:32.652]  And you've all been set up, America's set up for the fall,
[00:11:33.743 --> 00:12:01.574]  But it just feels so good to literally call in and do sutras, to do mantras, and hear them repeat, Saddam had WMDs, wants to kill us, Al-Qaeda, gotta get them here before they get us there, they've got nukes, George Bush is a conservative, commie liberals wanna kill us, hail, hail Bush, hail Bush, hail Bush once, hail Bush twice, I mean literally it's like Hail Marys or something, and it just goes on and on, and the liberals are the same way, wait till Hillary's in,
[00:12:02.316 --> 00:12:08.841]  I mean, suddenly they're not going to care about FEMA camps or Patriot Act or spying systems, and they're not going to care about any of it.
[00:12:12.243 --> 00:12:14.905]  Now, everything's telescoping now.
[00:12:15.465 --> 00:12:29.876]  Everything is kind of accelerated and more explosive, so it won't take four years for people to wake up to Hillary like it took six years for conservatives to finally wake up to Bush.
[00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:31.697]  It'll take about a year.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:40.983]  That's it, Hillary's controllers don't stage a giant terror attack in this country so she can grandstand and be our dear leader.
[00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:44.825]  Oh, look at how she brought the nation together in the time of pain.
[00:12:45.525 --> 00:12:47.846]  People were questioning, could a woman lead?
[00:12:48.346 --> 00:12:55.610]  But after she went to the site of the nuclear attack in Chicago or Dallas or New York or L.A.
[00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.511]  and she showed such courage there and she went in
[00:12:59.497 --> 00:13:05.766]  She was so concerned about the people that she went in with only a breathing mask, not even worried about herself.
[00:13:06.146 --> 00:13:13.196]  Her helicopter landed while she was there helping people at the AIDS Center on the edge of town for at least an hour.
[00:13:13.236 --> 00:13:16.341]  Of course, she'll land when the winds aren't blowing that direction.
[00:13:17.101 --> 00:13:17.822]  I think so.
[00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:42.615]  You know, to tell the people to be calm, oh the leadership, oh Hillary, oh, and by then they'll just go for broke.
[00:13:42.635 --> 00:13:48.878]  It'll be troops arresting anybody that criticizes and foreign troops being inserted and they'll go for broke.
[00:13:51.739 --> 00:13:53.420]  And Fox News is already positioned
[00:13:54.306 --> 00:13:57.088]  Hillary, they're already reporting on her as if she's good.
[00:13:57.168 --> 00:14:01.010]  They're already becoming, quote, more neutral, a little more, quote, liberal.
[00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:11.875]  Everyone in the Republican Party is turning on Bush, putting all the sins of the New World Order onto their little puppet, onto the birdcage liner they're almost done with, before they insert a new one.
[00:14:12.216 --> 00:14:20.940]  You can see all the preparatory actions going on, and you will see mainline conservatives supporting Hillary after the terror attack.
[00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:26.882]  And after the big terror attack, you may not even have access to the internet.
[00:14:26.942 --> 00:14:28.404]  All of that's going to be shut down for a while.
[00:14:28.444 --> 00:14:36.471]  So, you'll want to save what I'm saying now, so you can go back and listen to the file, and know that I was correct, if they're able to carry it off.
[00:14:38.012 --> 00:14:47.621]  Now, that's what we're... and I know, cops are laughing right now, but see, you'll be crying when it actually happens, and you're watching her at the bio-attack or the A-bomb press conference.
[00:14:48.852 --> 00:14:49.853]  Just like the police.
[00:14:49.873 --> 00:14:53.435]  You see, a lot of you didn't hear me before 9-11.
[00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:57.117]  And so, you don't know now.
[00:14:57.657 --> 00:15:04.141]  But a lot of police and military and government people did hear me before 9-11 lay out exactly what they would do.
[00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:12.045]  And I'm giving you the probable enemy scenarios from watching them and studying them 17 hours to 18 hours a day.
[00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:13.426]  I live it.
[00:15:13.906 --> 00:15:15.187]  I am submerged in it.
[00:15:15.607 --> 00:15:16.708]  I know their M.O.
[00:15:17.729 --> 00:15:24.233]  I mean, it's like being a cop who's been following a serial killer for 20 years, and he's learned his every trick and his M.O.
[00:15:24.293 --> 00:15:24.954]  in what he does.
[00:15:25.414 --> 00:15:30.718]  These people are serial killers, they do the same stuff, and we know how they operate.
[00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:31.878]  Alright?
[00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:41.905]  It could just be a total world economic collapse, but see, that'll end up getting blamed on who really did it, the globalists, and so I don't see them doing that alone.
[00:15:41.945 --> 00:15:43.626]  It'll probably be coupled with it, though.
[00:15:44.491 --> 00:15:44.991]  I don't think so.
[00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:28.582]  If we, if you, if us, all of us together hadn't gotten the word out about government-sponsored terror and inoculated psychologically the public to problem-reaction-solution operations, we have already done a great job, you've done a great job, serious pat on the back to all of you out there, in a holding pattern while we built up our forces.
[00:16:29.702 --> 00:16:34.685]  And we've done that now, and so at least now we're in a position of offense in this.
[00:16:35.226 --> 00:16:37.407]  The enemy's still got the major high ground.
[00:16:38.168 --> 00:16:39.949]  The enemy's still got more resources.
[00:16:39.989 --> 00:16:41.430]  They've still got the big guns.
[00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:57.661]  But we have, numerically, a larger force, and if we simply, what the enemy, I guess, would call us cockroaches, if we swarm them like a giant locust swarm of bees, we are impregnable.
[00:16:59.011 --> 00:17:13.998]  We are invincible if we have the Spirit of the Lord in our hearts and we're doing it for the right reasons, if we love God, if we love country, if we love our families, if we hate wickedness, if we truly face up to how evil our enemies are.
[00:17:14.458 --> 00:17:15.999]  We can move forward.
[00:17:16.639 --> 00:17:18.540]  You just set your teeth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:19.232 --> 00:17:23.275]  You just get the gleam in your eye and if you haven't ever turned it on, you need to really live.
[00:17:23.295 --> 00:17:24.156]  You need to turn it on.
[00:17:24.416 --> 00:17:25.697]  You need to turn your guts on.
[00:17:26.057 --> 00:17:30.761]  You need to grow a spine and stop being jellyfish and just decide.
[00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:32.422]  Make the decision.
[00:17:32.882 --> 00:17:42.710]  Make the commitment to engage in the info war and make the commitment if this thing gets bloody and nasty and they keep drawing first blood to defend yourself.
[00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:54.806]  And just be ready and make the conscious decision and war game out in your mind and basically lay it out in your mind what you're going to do.
[00:17:57.381 --> 00:18:01.723]  And the enemy literally, literally knows we're rising against them.
[00:18:02.124 --> 00:18:07.006]  The enemy literally knows that we're standing against them, and they are off balance.
[00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:08.327]  They are freaked out.
[00:18:08.347 --> 00:18:20.734]  These are arrogant, weak, sissy control freaks who want, you know, the black uniforms and the big weapons and all the rest of it to try to intimidate us, and they love all the trappings of petty power.
[00:18:21.914 --> 00:18:23.555]  I'm not going to talk about the Queen anymore today.
[00:18:23.575 --> 00:18:26.777]  I've got a few clips coming up, but I'm going to be very brief about it.
[00:18:27.492 --> 00:18:39.537]  All I can tell you is last night I ended up watching Selects that Aaron Dykes got over about six, seven hours of watching C-SPAN and News Video of the dinners and the introductions at the dinners and the rest of it.
[00:18:39.978 --> 00:18:42.339]  I've never seen anything this disgusting in my life.
[00:18:43.099 --> 00:18:47.961]  It literally... I was having ten minutes of hate right out of Orwell's 1984.
[00:18:48.741 --> 00:18:54.504]  I mean, I literally... Colin Powell walks up in an effeminate, pathetic manner
[00:18:55.385 --> 00:19:03.229]  And starts bragging about how he's the Order of Bath Knight Commander, and he literally pleasures himself.
[00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:06.491]  You can see him feeding at the nerve of power.
[00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:13.995]  Literally, he puts his chin up in the air, and he sets his teeth together creamily, relishing it.
[00:19:14.115 --> 00:19:18.437]  I mean, this is the most disgusting... It is the antithesis of what I am.
[00:19:18.477 --> 00:19:19.678]  I mean, I want you to know that.
[00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:22.180]  I mean, I hope it's the antithesis of what you are.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.802]  It literally was like kryptonite to me, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:25.942 --> 00:19:29.144]  I just could not... It was like anti-matter.
[00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:32.906]  It would just... I was literally staring into it.
[00:19:33.827 --> 00:19:35.768]  Into our jellyfish enemy souls.
[00:19:36.928 --> 00:19:43.832]  You know, they got these hard shells, but inside, folks, they are... We should just be able to push these people right aside.
[00:19:44.192 --> 00:19:45.093]  I mean, I'm serious.
[00:19:45.133 --> 00:19:48.495]  They love uniforms and regalia and crap.
[00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:53.278]  And I just, they just, oh my god, it's coming up later.
[00:19:53.698 --> 00:19:55.181]  We'll do that in the third hour actually.
[00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:56.483]  I have to shut up about it now.
[00:19:56.944 --> 00:19:59.709]  Huge Ron Paul news when we get back, and then your calls.
[00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:04.813]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.434 --> 00:20:14.364]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.805 --> 00:20:22.013]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.728 --> 00:20:28.233]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.713 --> 00:20:39.542]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.303 --> 00:20:42.305]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.845 --> 00:20:45.646]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:45.686 --> 00:20:46.006]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:01.463 --> 00:21:07.688]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:08.128 --> 00:21:15.914]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:16.255 --> 00:21:24.101]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:29.163]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:29.504 --> 00:21:34.226]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:38.588]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:39.088 --> 00:21:40.089]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:40.169 --> 00:21:44.191]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:44.671 --> 00:21:49.057]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:49.578 --> 00:21:52.141]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:54.224]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.344 --> 00:21:54.584]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:05.733]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:22:05.794 --> 00:22:13.116]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:22:13.256 --> 00:22:23.879]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:28.640]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.903]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:22:34.123 --> 00:22:37.065]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:37.285 --> 00:22:47.090]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:52.019]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:52.520]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.163]  Or order on the web at perkywater.com.
[00:23:00.399 --> 00:23:06.382]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:23:06.602 --> 00:23:08.923]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:23:09.204 --> 00:23:12.465]  That's why you need SFR's Protecta Synthetic Oil Treatments.
[00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:17.448]  Protecta Engine Treatment, Protecta Transmission Treatment, and Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:25.452]  Protecta meets the demands you put on your vehicle by providing more horsepower, improving gas mileage, decreasing emissions, and promotes longer engine life.
[00:23:25.752 --> 00:23:32.636]  Only Protecta contains a new technology, Nano B, which is not found in any competitive additive products at your local auto parts store.
[00:23:32.896 --> 00:23:36.838]  At Protecta, we do not compromise quality, because you expect the very best.
[00:23:36.938 --> 00:23:40.040]  We provide products that work right the first time, every time.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.381]  So get more when you treat it right with Protecta.
[00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:43.022]  I think so.
[00:24:16.921 --> 00:24:18.422]  Your enemies are weak.
[00:24:20.684 --> 00:24:22.486]  We can take them.
[00:24:22.546 --> 00:24:26.109]  You've got to first believe that you can win.
[00:24:26.649 --> 00:24:28.371]  And that our enemies are not invincible.
[00:24:28.811 --> 00:24:30.333]  We are invincible.
[00:24:31.433 --> 00:24:34.016]  We will only take victory in our hands.
[00:24:34.736 --> 00:24:35.917]  And we don't have a choice.
[00:24:36.398 --> 00:24:37.619]  Our enemies know they're weak.
[00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:39.640]  They're threatened by our strength.
[00:24:40.241 --> 00:24:43.263]  And they're trying to warp and twist all of us as a society.
[00:24:44.064 --> 00:24:44.865]  Refuse them.
[00:24:45.922 --> 00:24:47.002]  Rise against them!
[00:24:47.662 --> 00:24:49.083]  Turn your soul on!
[00:24:51.043 --> 00:24:51.523]  Alright.
[00:24:52.744 --> 00:24:54.604]  Ron Paul, total victory.
[00:24:55.844 --> 00:24:58.225]  Yet censorship continues.
[00:24:58.365 --> 00:25:07.047]  Texas congressman trounces rivals in all polls, but is deliberately pushed to margins by terrified corporate media.
[00:25:07.067 --> 00:25:12.188]  We're going to be getting the congressman back up this week or next week, very soon.
[00:25:12.268 --> 00:25:14.149]  It was a full hour last month.
[00:25:15.271 --> 00:25:18.754]  Only Congressman Ron Paul can defeat Hillary.
[00:25:19.254 --> 00:25:21.115]  The Republicans are totally shot.
[00:25:21.155 --> 00:25:22.996]  Their name is almost completely blown.
[00:25:23.016 --> 00:25:35.865]  The field is a group of weak, uncharismatic, unconstitutional weirdos and mobsters and just crooks and fake patriots.
[00:25:36.646 --> 00:25:38.387]  I mean, it's quite a disgusting gaggle.
[00:25:39.858 --> 00:25:42.459]  Tom Tancredo is nothing compared to Ron Paul.
[00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:43.959]  He's a warmonger.
[00:25:44.899 --> 00:25:47.500]  He is wrong on a bunch of issues.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.541]  The police state, everything.
[00:25:49.561 --> 00:25:51.601]  And he knows that now.
[00:25:51.641 --> 00:25:53.142]  He's trying to act like he's Ron Paul.
[00:25:53.182 --> 00:25:53.542]  He's not.
[00:25:53.882 --> 00:25:57.463]  And look, I would vote for Tom Tancredo above anybody if it wasn't for Ron Paul.
[00:25:57.983 --> 00:26:06.445]  I mean, his few problems are... He's certainly a lot better than most of them, but he's not even in the same... He's ten leagues below.
[00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:08.926]  He's not even anywhere in the same universe
[00:26:10.111 --> 00:26:31.988]  As Congressman Ron Paul, who you just cannot ask for a better candidate, founding father material, and ladies and gentlemen, we took this screenshot last night when I was collaborating with Paul Watson to write this article that I just contributed to in a small way.
[00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:35.751]  Ron Paul on ABC News poll had 15,568 votes.
[00:26:41.448 --> 00:26:42.949]  Don't know who they're going to vote for, 1,530.
[00:26:42.989 --> 00:26:44.209]  Now guess who's number two behind Paul?
[00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:44.949]  Mitt Romney at 245 votes.
[00:26:44.969 --> 00:26:45.349]  Rudy Giuliani, 211.
[00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:45.970]  John McCain, 123.
[00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.010]  Tom Tancredo, 46.
[00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:47.890]  Tommy Thompson, 27.
[00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:48.951]  Mike Huckabee, 21.
[00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:50.571]  Sam Brownback, and that's 16.
[00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:51.371]  Duncan Hunter, 15.
[00:26:51.411 --> 00:26:51.832]  James Gilmore, 11.
[00:26:51.892 --> 00:26:52.572]  Total votes, 18,000.
[00:27:11.343 --> 00:27:13.305]  And this is only a one-vote system.
[00:27:13.705 --> 00:27:15.226]  It puts a cookie on your computer.
[00:27:15.326 --> 00:27:15.907]  It knows.
[00:27:15.927 --> 00:27:28.917]  I wouldn't call it scientific, but it certainly doesn't allow bum-rushing and basically triple-counting or double-counting.
[00:27:29.377 --> 00:27:31.098]  Vote often.
[00:27:31.499 --> 00:27:32.259]  Vote repeatedly.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.964]  But as the Democrats like to do, and that was their past way of election fraud.
[00:27:38.024 --> 00:27:41.006]  The Republicans just own the companies and engage in it that way.
[00:27:41.978 --> 00:27:45.000]  But Ron Paul is winning every single poll out there.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.961]  This is just the latest.
[00:27:46.361 --> 00:27:48.262]  He's been winning scientific polls.
[00:27:49.223 --> 00:27:51.664]  He has been trouncing everybody.
[00:27:52.525 --> 00:27:59.509]  And, by the way, ABC had to start their poll over, because for two days, Ron Paul wasn't even on the poll.
[00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.671]  On Yahoo, Ron Paul wasn't on the poll.
[00:28:03.872 --> 00:28:06.654]  On CNN, Ron Paul wasn't on the poll.
[00:28:07.896 --> 00:28:10.878]  And we posted a video yesterday on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:14.021]  It's up there right now in the video section.
[00:28:15.462 --> 00:28:18.544]  And there's an, I guess you'd call it an AverKey.
[00:28:18.965 --> 00:28:20.646]  We've got the same software here.
[00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:27.271]  And what it does is it allows you to plug into your computer monitor and just record your internet surfing.
[00:28:28.112 --> 00:28:32.435]  And we didn't just believe the lister that sent us the video, and it's a great lister by the way.
[00:28:32.455 --> 00:28:35.858]  Did a great job, but we trust but verify.
[00:28:37.027 --> 00:28:39.649]  And we went and tried it ourselves and indeed it's true.
[00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:40.670]  We have a MySpace account.
[00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:44.132]  Most Ron Paul posts and bulletins are banned.
[00:28:44.833 --> 00:28:46.734]  In fact, we couldn't do bulletins with his name in it.
[00:28:47.435 --> 00:28:50.157]  But we were able to post links and things on the page.
[00:28:50.737 --> 00:28:55.861]  So, they are blocking his name as a keyword because they don't want MySpace.
[00:28:55.921 --> 00:28:57.522]  He's gone viral on MySpace.
[00:28:57.962 --> 00:28:59.603]  He's gone viral on YouTube.
[00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:01.365]  He's gone viral on Google.
[00:29:03.486 --> 00:29:04.447]  We are witnessing
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.781]  An actual revolution right now.
[00:29:07.901 --> 00:29:26.453]  A peaceful revolution with the man that has introduced legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve, get us out of the UN, abolish the BATF, abolish most federal agencies, control our borders, reaffirm the Second Amendment, get us out of Iraq, everything we need.
[00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:29.195]  And there's talk of, well, they'll kill him.
[00:29:29.635 --> 00:29:32.457]  He said on air, and he told me privately, he's ready to die.
[00:29:33.743 --> 00:29:35.764]  I mean, he's a combat veteran.
[00:29:36.004 --> 00:29:40.266]  He was in the front lines in Vietnam in those hospitals when they were getting rocketed.
[00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:43.688]  And he's delivered thousands of babies.
[00:29:43.728 --> 00:29:44.488]  I mean, he's a man.
[00:29:44.848 --> 00:29:46.109]  He knows what men are supposed to do.
[00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:47.690]  He stepped up to the plate.
[00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.271]  Let's step up there with him!
[00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:50.351]  We'll be right back!
[00:29:51.672 --> 00:29:52.612]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.052 --> 00:29:54.673]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.574 --> 00:29:58.255]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.296 --> 00:30:04.737]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:30:04.857 --> 00:30:10.119]  Did you know that the Bible forecasts signs to let us know that we're in the last days?
[00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:16.861]  The book of Revelation says that world travel, quickly and efficiently, would be one sign, and also knowledge would increase.
[00:30:17.601 --> 00:30:21.002]  Knowledge is doubling every two and a half years in the electronic industry.
[00:30:21.582 --> 00:30:29.223]  We'd like to help you understand more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:32:05.327 --> 00:32:08.728]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:08.889 --> 00:32:12.411]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:15.853]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:15.873 --> 00:32:21.376]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:32:21.416 --> 00:32:26.639]  When we do our programs, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.200]  Thank you for your time.

[00:33:01.565 --> 00:33:22.912]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska Go north for us you song North to Alaska Go north for us you song Big Sam left Seattle in the year of 92
[00:33:24.712 --> 00:33:29.697]  With George Pratt, his partner, and brother Billy, too.
[00:33:30.437 --> 00:33:35.482]  They crossed the Yukon River and found the Bonanza Gold.
[00:33:36.202 --> 00:33:46.491]  Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome, Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below.
[00:33:47.572 --> 00:34:11.321]  He talked to his team of Huskies As he mushed on through the snow With the northern lights a-runnin' wild In the land of the midnight sun Yes, Sam McCord was a mighty man In the year of 19-1 Where the river is windin' Big Nuggets they're findin' Nuggets!
[00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:14.102]  Welcome back.
[00:34:15.663 --> 00:34:20.206]  I wish that's where I was, out in the mountains somewhere, fishing in a trout stream.
[00:34:20.906 --> 00:34:27.209]  No, we're fighting the New World Order and that's frankly no other place I'd rather be as long as this threat is bearing down on us.
[00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:32.852]  John, Marco, David, Hannah, Chris, many others, your calls are coming up momentarily.
[00:34:32.872 --> 00:34:37.815]  Just on the Ron Paul situation, Ron Paul emerged from last week's GOP debate
[00:34:39.065 --> 00:34:50.432]  As completely victorious according to every available benchmark and yet there is still a deliberate ploy to push the Texas Congressman to the sidelines on behalf of a terrified corporate media.
[00:34:51.553 --> 00:34:52.733]  Well of course there is!
[00:34:54.014 --> 00:35:05.261]  They know that he'll make Ross Perot look like a look like a benchwarmer, look like a Tedley Winks player, look like a two-year-old compared to a pro football player.
[00:35:06.785 --> 00:35:08.787]  I mean, Ron Paul's got the pedigree.
[00:35:09.788 --> 00:35:13.211]  Ross Perot didn't, and it later came out there was some black ops going on there.
[00:35:14.332 --> 00:35:15.593]  Ron Paul isn't a joke.
[00:35:15.673 --> 00:35:16.794]  He isn't playing games.
[00:35:16.854 --> 00:35:17.695]  He's the real deal.
[00:35:18.015 --> 00:35:18.836]  The real McCoy.
[00:35:19.998 --> 00:35:22.579]  And we need to get behind him and get behind him now.
[00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:23.800]  I know you are behind him.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.161]  That's why they're panicking and trying to contain the fact that he is the winner.
[00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:40.826]  He would be positioned, if we had a real media, he would now be positioned as the frontrunner, going in with months and months to build up his war chest and literally push aside all of his enemies.
[00:35:40.846 --> 00:35:48.669]  And then they try to put it into high gear to demonize him and dig up dirt on him, but there's nothing to dig up.
[00:35:48.689 --> 00:35:49.149]  It's just
[00:35:51.106 --> 00:35:52.668]  This is a major test, folks.
[00:35:53.048 --> 00:35:54.570]  This is a major crossroads.
[00:35:54.930 --> 00:36:02.537]  We've got to push this over the edge and demand that he be front and center and that CNN and Fox and the rest of them admit he is the winner.
[00:36:03.818 --> 00:36:16.510]  Every single major online poll shows conclusively that Ron Paul won the debate by a mammoth margin, trouncing the bought and paid for shill neocon candidates that the establishment press are sworn to uphold.
[00:36:17.828 --> 00:36:23.411]  We mentioned out of 18,007 votes, that was just last night, he got 15,568 of them.
[00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.392]  All of his competition combined didn't get more than 800 votes.
[00:36:25.412 --> 00:36:26.532]  800 votes versus almost 16,000.
[00:36:26.572 --> 00:36:28.873]  What, I mean, that means he got like 90 plus percent?
[00:36:28.893 --> 00:36:29.213]  94 percent?
[00:36:29.233 --> 00:36:31.074]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:36:44.418 --> 00:36:56.546]  Just over 18,000 votes on ABC News poll shows Ron Paul with 15,568 compared with the nearest rival, Mitt Romney, who is, I mean, I wouldn't trust that guy as far as I could throw him.
[00:36:57.087 --> 00:37:06.073]  A paltry 245 after initially scrubbing Ron Paul from the poll all together, ABC was forced to add his name after a deluge of furious calls and emails.
[00:37:06.493 --> 00:37:07.013]  That's right.
[00:37:07.353 --> 00:37:14.198]  This isn't the old days where you can just steal elections by selection of the candidates for us and not ever letting us see a real statesman.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.024]  Or a real constitutionalist.
[00:37:16.225 --> 00:37:17.248]  He doesn't work anymore.
[00:37:18.572 --> 00:37:21.261]  Even Paul's lead MSNBC's polled.
[00:37:22.578 --> 00:37:25.621]  Right from the start before it had even been widely circulated.
[00:37:25.961 --> 00:37:33.288]  ABC News claims that the activists voting and multiple voting by individuals artificially inflated Paul's numbers, but both claims are demonstrably false.
[00:37:33.629 --> 00:37:42.117]  Keith Overman reported that Paul was ahead before the link was spread around message boards and blogs, and the vote multiple times is impossible.
[00:37:42.337 --> 00:37:45.360]  The poll only allows for one voter per IP address.
[00:37:47.125 --> 00:37:47.585]  That's right.
[00:37:47.606 --> 00:37:54.892]  Keith Olbermann, before they even closed out debate coverage, within an hour of an ending, said Ron Paul has blown them all away.
[00:37:55.312 --> 00:37:56.073]  Ron Paul.
[00:37:56.353 --> 00:37:57.454]  Ron Paul!
[00:37:59.916 --> 00:38:07.182]  It's just like when we, you know, Terror Storm, two times we know of, when they erased our millions of views because we were getting into the top 100 over and over again.
[00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:08.023]  They were just a racist.
[00:38:08.423 --> 00:38:08.964]  They cheat.
[00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.111]  Just like Digg.
[00:38:11.151 --> 00:38:12.992]  We keep taking over the main page of Digg.
[00:38:13.412 --> 00:38:18.656]  They go and censor us, and Digg, four months ago, admittedly banned us for a while, and just said, you're banned.
[00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:22.259]  They just said, your news isn't real news.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:34.928]  They have to cheat, ladies and gentlemen, because the will, and the Constitution, and what the American people want, the people, we always say people are dumb, and some still are dumb, but a lot of folks are awake.
[00:38:35.448 --> 00:38:36.509]  They're trying to block us.
[00:38:36.609 --> 00:38:37.790]  Sorry, I'll go to your calls in a minute.
[00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:46.934]  At a time of press, Paul currently has 40% approval and 25% disapproval compared with 43% disapproval and 22% approval for Giuliani.
[00:38:47.254 --> 00:38:52.176]  See Paul in another C-SPAN poll is blowing him completely away and winning.
[00:38:52.916 --> 00:38:53.857]  He has the best numbers.
[00:38:56.758 --> 00:38:57.678]  Here's another poll.
[00:38:58.239 --> 00:38:58.759]  Ron Paul at 69%.
[00:38:58.799 --> 00:38:59.339]  Mitt Romney 9%.
[00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:00.260]  Blowing him away there.
[00:39:05.535 --> 00:39:06.656]  Go to the back of the page.
[00:39:06.756 --> 00:39:09.978]  That was another MSNBC poll.
[00:39:10.799 --> 00:39:17.303]  Capital News and Arm of the C-SPAN had Paul leading his nearest rival, Mitt Romney, by 60% shortly before voting closed.
[00:39:17.924 --> 00:39:20.866]  Rudy Giuliani garnered just 6% of the vote.
[00:39:20.946 --> 00:39:21.866]  Everybody hates him.
[00:39:21.927 --> 00:39:22.767]  New York hates him.
[00:39:23.007 --> 00:39:24.728]  It's an illusion that he's some hero.
[00:39:25.269 --> 00:39:31.493]  Yahoo News is still censoring Ron Paul by not including him in a list of candidates for their 2008 presidential coverage page.
[00:39:32.034 --> 00:39:32.194]  See?
[00:39:34.131 --> 00:39:40.776]  Despite the fact that he is widely popular and has trounced every other Republican candidate in every online poll.
[00:39:41.477 --> 00:39:42.417]  He's just not there.
[00:39:42.918 --> 00:39:45.279]  And they don't care if they get 10,000 emails an hour.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.161]  They just say, are you kidding?
[00:39:48.181 --> 00:39:49.342]  We've got to destroy America.
[00:39:49.743 --> 00:39:52.645]  We can't let Ron Paul get in there and become president.
[00:39:52.665 --> 00:39:53.746]  We've got to destroy you.
[00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:57.628]  99% of you don't want North American Union?
[00:39:57.648 --> 00:39:58.229]  We're going to do it.
[00:39:58.249 --> 00:40:01.731]  97% don't want foreign companies running toll roads on existing roads?
[00:40:01.772 --> 00:40:02.312]  We're going to do it.
[00:40:03.716 --> 00:40:05.742]  Over 90% of you don't want forced inoculations.
[00:40:05.762 --> 00:40:06.525]  They're going to try to do it.
[00:40:06.545 --> 00:40:09.033]  91% in Gallup polls want to shut the borders.
[00:40:09.074 --> 00:40:09.957]  They're going to do the opposite.
[00:40:10.766 --> 00:40:18.613]  After receiving a flood of angry complaints, Yahoo promised to review the situation, but 24 hours later, the page is still absent any mention of Ron Paul.
[00:40:18.993 --> 00:40:34.146]  This whole fiasco underscores the reality that the President of the United States is not elected by the popular will of the people, but instead is selected from a highly restricted gaggle of pre-approved establishment lackeys who've got more skeletons in their closet than a New York mausoleum, I would add.
[00:40:35.319 --> 00:40:40.902]  The corporate media offer the excuse that Ron Paul is not a mainstream candidate and his little chance of winning.
[00:40:41.202 --> 00:40:44.464]  Therefore, the decision to afford him little coverage is justified.
[00:40:45.204 --> 00:40:47.685]  But this is a chicken and egg scenario.
[00:40:48.086 --> 00:40:54.949]  If the media routinely ignores the so-called marginal candidates, then they are never going to attain exposure of a Giuliani or Romney.
[00:40:55.169 --> 00:40:57.390]  Thus, the media has become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.691]  Yeah, but it's more than that.
[00:41:00.186 --> 00:41:07.431]  Ron Paul in major scientific polls has been showing, you know, number two or number three six months ago, four months ago.
[00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:10.534]  Ron Paul is wildly popular.
[00:41:11.174 --> 00:41:15.177]  He's a cult icon with libertarians and true conservatives and anti-war liberals.
[00:41:15.698 --> 00:41:17.639]  Everybody knows who Ron Paul is.
[00:41:18.259 --> 00:41:19.640]  That's a load of bull!
[00:41:20.641 --> 00:41:22.162]  And I'm so proud of our audience.
[00:41:22.182 --> 00:41:22.983]  You know, Ron Paul
[00:41:25.077 --> 00:41:32.763]  Was on this show, what, three weeks ago, and out of the blue, I didn't request this, he said, we have gotten more support from your show than any other place.
[00:41:32.803 --> 00:41:43.050]  He said the majority of people, when I'm in other states, who come to the meetings and come to support us, they say, it's from your show.
[00:41:44.891 --> 00:41:47.093]  Now, am I trying to burrow into his campaign?
[00:41:47.113 --> 00:41:49.334]  No, I'm not even going to his fundraiser this weekend.
[00:41:49.374 --> 00:41:51.436]  I'm too busy editing, making a video.
[00:41:52.153 --> 00:41:55.354]  Am I trying to burrow in to the locals that are supporting him?
[00:41:55.414 --> 00:41:55.574]  No.
[00:41:55.594 --> 00:41:56.434]  And do they call me?
[00:41:56.474 --> 00:41:57.714]  Of course not.
[00:41:58.715 --> 00:41:59.395]  Which is fine.
[00:41:59.795 --> 00:42:04.776]  Everybody's got to have their own little thing and dress up like it's a mini Queen meeting or something.
[00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:05.837]  And that's fine.
[00:42:05.877 --> 00:42:13.979]  But I think I still will dig out the details of it and plug it because that's what matters is supporting it and people going to the fundraiser.
[00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:17.060]  And I'm not even criticizing.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.600]  It's just that we all have to come together
[00:42:19.492 --> 00:42:26.280]  And I'm not here trying to throw out the gauntlet and say, see, my listeners and we're the best.
[00:42:26.701 --> 00:42:29.664]  But frankly, it's like John Wayne said, no brag, just fact.
[00:42:30.145 --> 00:42:35.912]  I want you to realize how important you are as listeners and activists of this broadcast and how we're a family.
[00:42:37.762 --> 00:42:43.986]  And how there's going to be a lot of mainline establishment types that are going to try to basically co-opt the Ron Paul message and frankly water it down.
[00:42:44.026 --> 00:42:49.489]  And we've got to ensure that this strong anti-New World Order message continues, because that is the popular message.
[00:42:49.509 --> 00:42:50.489]  Look at Lou Dobbs.
[00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:58.094]  He is about to supplant, and he is neck and neck now to supplant Bill O'Reilly, his numero uno.
[00:42:59.094 --> 00:42:59.775]  And what's he got?
[00:43:00.135 --> 00:43:03.397]  An anti-New World Order, populist, pro-America message.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:21.769]  If Ron Paul was afforded equal media coverage at every step of the way before the Republican nomination, and if America was still a free country with a democratic process that actually worked, then Ron Paul would be a shoe-in for the Oval Office.
[00:43:22.249 --> 00:43:36.037]  But the fact remains, as is painfully underscored in the media's treatment of Ron Paul, that America is a banana republic where the President is not elected by popular will, but selected by the corporate and military industrial kingpins
[00:43:37.196 --> 00:43:40.158]  That for whom, upon inauguration, he becomes the puppet.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:47.965]  So let's get in there and support and try to drive this revolution over the edge and have a literal InfoWars revolt.
[00:43:49.065 --> 00:43:59.774]  And look, I'm not trying to get up here and whine and peon, but I guess as they say, you know, somebody getting the word out never gets a lot of support in his own country or in his own town.
[00:44:00.973 --> 00:44:07.539]  It's just that I never have demanded heirs or trinkets of power or signature logo of office.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.320]  I don't want that.
[00:44:09.001 --> 00:44:17.530]  I just want the credit due to my listeners that is due to you for the incredible job you've done and an example of what we can do in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:44:23.749 --> 00:44:24.729]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:29.030]  And again, I am just so proud of you, the listeners of this show.
[00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:36.532]  You are not just the biggest in the breakdown, but you are the majority of the support the Congressman has gotten.
[00:44:36.992 --> 00:44:38.132]  He told you that on air.
[00:44:38.452 --> 00:44:43.033]  He told me that privately, and I didn't want to sound like too much to lead him into it.
[00:44:43.073 --> 00:44:43.953]  He just said it on air.
[00:44:45.234 --> 00:44:48.054]  The Congressman said, this show, the majority.
[00:44:48.594 --> 00:44:52.055]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the majority of the money they've raised is from you.
[00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:55.364]  I'm glad you know a good cause when you hear one.
[00:44:55.404 --> 00:44:56.605]  I plug for donations.
[00:44:56.665 --> 00:44:57.965]  They don't come in, really.
[00:44:59.326 --> 00:45:01.586]  But I do think the few we have gotten.
[00:45:01.646 --> 00:45:05.127]  Because, frankly, when leadership's thrown at you, I don't want it.
[00:45:05.207 --> 00:45:06.467]  I don't want the responsibility.
[00:45:06.987 --> 00:45:10.708]  But if we have to build up and expand what we're doing because others aren't, we will do it.
[00:45:11.149 --> 00:45:13.129]  And we are doing it.
[00:45:13.169 --> 00:45:14.930]  Because we know how serious things are.
[00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:16.450]  Alright, I'm going to shut up about Ron Paul.
[00:45:17.854 --> 00:45:25.716]  It is just so exciting what's happening, so go to his website that we have links to on Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:40.699]  Go to his websites and donate, call them, support them, and we're going to get the Congressman back on the show here in the very near future for you to continue to fundraise for the Congressman.
[00:45:41.979 --> 00:45:44.180]  Going right to the source, you the wonderful,
[00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:47.620]  I just love you, listeners of this transmission.
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.302]  Just to know that we're having this big of an effect thanks to God.
[00:45:51.362 --> 00:45:52.503]  God gives all the glory.
[00:45:53.724 --> 00:45:54.604]  It's just so exciting.
[00:45:55.825 --> 00:45:57.826]  Joe in Wisconsin and Marco and others.
[00:45:57.846 --> 00:45:58.467]  Go ahead, Joe.
[00:45:59.587 --> 00:46:00.068]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:00.508 --> 00:46:00.688]  Amen.
[00:46:00.788 --> 00:46:05.911]  I'd like to hear more about Ron Paul, but I've got a constitutional crisis on campus.
[00:46:07.232 --> 00:46:13.236]  Our outgoing class president sent a mass email that advanced weaponry would be used
[00:46:13.895 --> 00:46:20.478]  in a credible threat for killing our current student officers.
[00:46:21.538 --> 00:46:25.280]  And they are trying to declare domestic terrorists.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:32.322]  And my take on that... Okay, you need to send me this in email, any news articles, any documentation.
[00:46:32.903 --> 00:46:34.583]  You know, just boil it down.
[00:46:34.703 --> 00:46:35.844]  Exactly what's going on.
[00:46:35.884 --> 00:46:36.504]  What are you saying?
[00:46:37.671 --> 00:46:40.214]  I believe that they have... A class presidentship?
[00:46:40.234 --> 00:46:41.175]  We're going to kill everybody!
[00:46:41.656 --> 00:46:46.242]  No, the class president said they were getting death threats.
[00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:48.084]  The Student Association, who...
[00:46:49.258 --> 00:46:52.499]  Had a fake election maybe two weeks ago.
[00:46:52.519 --> 00:46:56.540]  It was just really so skewed it wasn't even funny.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.120]  Send me your info, sir.
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:58.760]  I appreciate it.
[00:46:58.941 --> 00:47:02.882]  You call in every few months with what's happening up in Wisconsin with your school.
[00:47:03.542 --> 00:47:04.562]  And I just need names.
[00:47:04.782 --> 00:47:06.002]  Why don't you write an article about it?
[00:47:06.442 --> 00:47:09.083]  And then proof of your claims and we'll post it.
[00:47:09.943 --> 00:47:10.423]  Okay?
[00:47:10.624 --> 00:47:11.884]  I'm not trying to cut you off short.
[00:47:11.964 --> 00:47:15.125]  It's just... They're trying to gear up for World War III.
[00:47:15.145 --> 00:47:16.225]  The dollar's plunging.
[00:47:17.472 --> 00:47:19.953]  We know the schools are nothing but prison training camps.
[00:47:20.073 --> 00:47:23.535]  Many of the colleges, the high schools, the elementary schools, they have drills at them.
[00:47:23.876 --> 00:47:25.536]  The wicked fleeth when none pursueth.
[00:47:26.077 --> 00:47:34.201]  If there is a shooting at your school, the police will stand down for hours and literally just put on gear and then run around cowering, rolling around the ground like jellyfish.
[00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:40.865]  And of course everyone's freaking out, claiming they're getting threats and all this type of bull.
[00:47:40.905 --> 00:47:44.987]  And of course the school's going to say they need to put metal detectors in and frisk everyone.
[00:47:45.247 --> 00:47:47.028]  This is your induction into enslavement.
[00:47:47.868 --> 00:47:49.529]  And so just send me some information, Joe.
[00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.891]  Marco in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:47:53.152 --> 00:47:53.412]  Hello?
[00:47:53.813 --> 00:47:54.393]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:56.275]  Hi Alex, how are you doing this morning?
[00:47:56.435 --> 00:47:56.735]  Good.
[00:47:57.556 --> 00:48:01.899]  Anyway, I just come from Houston and it's mind-boggling all the things that you have to say.
[00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:03.160]  I totally agree on everything.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:07.503]  First of all, and first hand, because we don't get this kind of information in Houston.
[00:48:08.584 --> 00:48:14.909]  And there's anything, how can this network get it on the air in Houston since it's so much needed?
[00:48:15.339 --> 00:48:17.020]  For that community, for all of us.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.061]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:48:18.081 --> 00:48:18.581]  Here's the deal.
[00:48:18.621 --> 00:48:19.822]  Houston is very controlled.
[00:48:19.882 --> 00:48:20.982]  Dallas is very controlled.
[00:48:21.002 --> 00:48:32.089]  The globalists do demographic studies, and they know that Texas in the past has been very rebellious against tyranny, and so they are very careful to keep this type of show off the air.
[00:48:32.269 --> 00:48:36.972]  I'm only on three commercial stations in Texas.
[00:48:37.052 --> 00:48:37.733]  We should be on 50.
[00:48:39.203 --> 00:48:42.566]  Uh, and, uh, it is a great victory that I'm on KLBJ 590.
[00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:46.549]  It is a great victory that I'm on a few other stations around the state that are commercial.
[00:48:46.569 --> 00:48:53.454]  Uh, we have had micros, you know, unlicensed little, little family run things down there, but they've trounced on those.
[00:48:54.234 --> 00:48:55.435]  Can I say something before I leave?
[00:48:55.455 --> 00:48:55.856]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:48:55.876 --> 00:48:59.658]  If there's anything I can do myself, because people are so thirsty for this kind of information.
[00:48:59.699 --> 00:49:00.759]  Me, myself, I'm 100% Ron Paul.
[00:49:24.792 --> 00:49:35.897]  I learned from the fact, I just don't, and I see what you're talking about, how they censor him, but not only that, they are already calling him names, and like he's not even, some guy, I don't even know his show, because I usually change the channel as soon as I can.
[00:49:36.517 --> 00:49:38.358]  He was saying that, uh, who's this guy?
[00:49:38.998 --> 00:49:41.900]  You know, he was really about mobbing him, and I was, I was outraged.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:49.063]  So if there's anything I can do, maybe I can give you my number off the air, and if there's anything I can do myself, because this is a community effort.
[00:49:49.383 --> 00:49:53.725]  I'm just listening and taking it for myself, but I want to spread the word as much as you do,
[00:49:54.289 --> 00:49:56.030]  And this is something we all should do.
[00:49:56.130 --> 00:50:00.533]  If I want to get more involved, if you want to take my number off the air, get a hold of me.
[00:50:01.813 --> 00:50:02.674]  Well, let me tell you this.
[00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:06.396]  I'm not running... I mean, I have a very small staff of employees.
[00:50:06.456 --> 00:50:09.058]  I can barely even, you know, finance everything I'm doing.
[00:50:10.238 --> 00:50:12.039]  I need to give you Ron Paul's website.
[00:50:12.059 --> 00:50:15.441]  And for some reason, I've got so much info in my head.
[00:50:15.461 --> 00:50:20.404]  I mean, I know Ron Paul Explorer is one, but I think it's Ron Paul 2000.
[00:50:21.943 --> 00:50:33.272]  You know what, uh, 2008... Let me check, let me check it on the website myself and see what I can... Especially with Ron Paul, with all the politicians that we now... I call him, you know, I heard yesterday somebody call him political prosecutor.
[00:50:33.592 --> 00:50:37.935]  So they are completed with the media and it's just... And people's not getting the information.
[00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:40.477]  It's about... Well, I'll tell you what... There's so much the internet can do.
[00:50:41.244 --> 00:50:44.988]  Is there anything we can do in Houston for the Houston community to listen to?
[00:50:45.249 --> 00:50:45.869]  God bless you.
[00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:49.333]  Listen, RonPaul2008.com.
[00:50:49.894 --> 00:50:50.374]  Call them.
[00:50:50.715 --> 00:50:52.336]  I'll give you a phone number when we get back.
[00:50:52.937 --> 00:50:55.620]  And yes, sir, it's really great to talk to you, Marco.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.862]  And yes, this is a community.
[00:50:58.243 --> 00:51:01.026]  We are all brothers and sisters in the fight for liberty.
[00:51:04.711 --> 00:51:10.157]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.538 --> 00:51:18.146]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.863 --> 00:51:25.907]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.307 --> 00:51:37.733]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.053 --> 00:51:41.715]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.996 --> 00:51:43.937]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.277 --> 00:51:48.119]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:05.314]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:05.875]  are located?
[00:52:06.075 --> 00:52:09.478]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:53:01.337 --> 00:53:03.058]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.278 --> 00:53:06.979]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.299 --> 00:53:09.520]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:16.243]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.403 --> 00:53:21.285]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.485 --> 00:53:30.514]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:58.703 --> 00:55:01.045]  Check out his MySpace account, his Meetup account.
[00:55:02.405 --> 00:55:04.187]  The Ron Paul Daily Update, press releases.
[00:55:04.207 --> 00:55:07.989]  We're going to be posting daily all the press releases on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:08.029 --> 00:55:09.790]  In fact, those are all going up for you right now.
[00:55:10.431 --> 00:55:11.812]  Thanks to Paul Watson's hard work.
[00:55:12.372 --> 00:55:16.255]  Here's the phone number, Marco, if you want to volunteer in the Houston area.
[00:55:16.735 --> 00:55:22.459]  And yeah, you're going to hear fake trader, fake conservatives, who want open borders, who want gun control,
[00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:24.747]  Who work for the establishment.
[00:55:24.767 --> 00:55:30.049]  They're there to neutralize real libertarians, real conservatives, real Americans like yourself.
[00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:35.271]  They're there to neutralize you until it's too late, until we're inside the one world government.
[00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:37.672]  As Ron Paul has said, they all know who he is.
[00:55:37.952 --> 00:55:38.772]  Who's Ron Paul?
[00:55:38.972 --> 00:55:40.893]  Who's this nobody winning everything?
[00:55:41.933 --> 00:55:43.454]  We want Nip Romney!
[00:55:43.474 --> 00:55:44.954]  We want Giuliani!
[00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:46.275]  We want McCain!
[00:55:47.498 --> 00:55:48.199]  Here's the number.
[00:55:48.219 --> 00:55:48.259]  703-248-9115.
[00:55:48.279 --> 00:55:48.519]  702-248-9115.
[00:55:48.539 --> 00:55:49.520]  You can also fax them at 703-248-9119.
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:55.606]  And again, we will be having the Congressman up very, very soon back on the broadcast here for you.
[00:56:10.018 --> 00:56:14.880]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you also need to support us, and that's InfoWars.com.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:24.543]  Just go to the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart, check out all the materials that are there at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:25.863 --> 00:56:29.726]  And there's also PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, 15 cents a day.
[00:56:30.106 --> 00:56:34.169]  Believe it or not, that goes a long way towards paying our band with everything we're doing.
[00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:36.171]  I've made a lot of films.
[00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:37.932]  Just check them out if you believe in what we're doing.
[00:56:38.212 --> 00:56:39.914]  They're also essential in waking people up.
[00:56:40.754 --> 00:56:41.995]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:56:42.495 --> 00:56:43.356]  Let's go to Hannah.
[00:56:44.477 --> 00:56:46.218]  And Hannah's calling from Michigan.
[00:56:46.578 --> 00:56:47.499]  Hannah, you're on the air.
[00:56:47.519 --> 00:56:48.600]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.200]  Hi.
[00:56:49.941 --> 00:56:53.944]  I've had some encouraging things happen here locally in Port Huron.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:57:10.753]  Um, I had someone approach me about one of your movies, Martial Law, so that was exciting for me to, you know, I've been learning about this for the last two years, and it's like I feel like I'm alone here, because, you know, I've really never had anyone here say anything about it.
[00:57:11.273 --> 00:57:22.522]  But then, the next day, I was driving down 10th Street, and right above Goldie's Pawn Shop and Computer Repair Plus on 10th Street, they had this huge banner,
[00:57:23.214 --> 00:57:25.716]  And it said, 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:57:25.976 --> 00:57:27.037]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:27.057 --> 00:57:29.559]  So I was just floored by seeing that.
[00:57:29.759 --> 00:57:30.320]  Wow!
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.781]  So see, there's people in your town.
[00:57:33.182 --> 00:57:38.406]  That's why I tell listeners to go get the 9-11 inside job t-shirts we have on the website or the ball caps.
[00:57:38.906 --> 00:57:42.109]  Because believe me, our people who love freedom are everywhere.
[00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:47.753]  True patriots, people who love liberty and hate tyranny are all over the place.
[00:57:48.153 --> 00:57:51.616]  The only illusion left that the new order has is that we're not the majority.
[00:57:51.896 --> 00:57:52.977]  We are the majority.
[00:57:55.498 --> 00:58:10.619]  Yeah, so that was just very encouraging and inspiring to me and my husband and we've been trying to get copies of Loose Change 2 out to people and we actually took them there and talked to the guys there and they're passing them out so it's just good news and I wanted to share it with everyone.
[00:58:11.044 --> 00:58:14.507]  That is absolutely fabulous, and that film, Loose Change 2nd Edition, is excellent.
[00:58:14.867 --> 00:58:18.871]  I would also encourage all the activists, because it needs to get out there, Terror Storm.
[00:58:18.931 --> 00:58:25.336]  Make copies of Terror Storm, America Freedom to Fascism, and have a wide-ranging approach.
[00:58:26.137 --> 00:58:32.522]  Because Loose Change has gotten massive exposure, and I'm going to be involved in promoting the new one in big ways that we're not going to announce yet.
[00:58:32.802 --> 00:58:33.363]  I'm involved.
[00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:34.444]  Hook, line, and sinker.
[00:58:34.464 --> 00:58:35.284]  We'll just leave it at that.
[00:58:36.085 --> 00:58:39.188]  But we need to get Terror Storm out as well.
[00:58:41.872 --> 00:58:46.078]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.087 --> 00:58:58.728]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.388 --> 00:59:00.469]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.169 --> 00:59:02.290]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:03.751]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.492 --> 00:59:05.412]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.432 --> 00:59:10.095]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.256 --> 00:59:14.378]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.179 --> 00:59:16.160]  We're on the march.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.702]  The New World Order crime syndicate is on the run.
[00:59:19.742 --> 00:59:24.946]  That's what all this blustering and black uniform, black mask, camera on the street corner.
[00:59:25.286 --> 00:59:26.487]  We're building FEMA camp.
[00:59:27.233 --> 00:59:28.093]  Bolognese for.
[00:59:28.113 --> 00:59:29.554]  It's to scare us.
[00:59:30.814 --> 00:59:32.194]  No, we're not scared.
[00:59:33.014 --> 00:59:34.995]  You've punched us in the face once too many times.
[00:59:35.035 --> 00:59:39.616]  We've decided to go ahead and just beat the living daylights out of you, New World Order.
[00:59:40.096 --> 00:59:41.116]  You've been asking for it.
[00:59:41.136 --> 00:59:42.977]  You've drawn first blood over and over again.
[00:59:43.537 --> 00:59:45.617]  You've danced on the grave of too many patriots.
[00:59:46.478 --> 00:59:49.778]  And we're going to get it in our minds that you're going to be beat.
[00:59:50.458 --> 00:59:53.139]  We're going to tell our phony preachers who are telling us to lay down to evil.
[00:59:53.159 --> 00:59:56.700]  We're going to tell them to just go back to where their father came from.
[00:59:57.723 --> 01:00:03.505]  And to get behind us, get out of our way, and we're going to move forward.
[01:00:04.646 --> 01:00:08.548]  We're going to move forward in our prosecution of the war against the New World Order.
[01:00:08.588 --> 01:00:14.190]  We've got a big population reduction group that's calling for one-child policy joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:18.952]  Right now, let's go to David in Minnesota, then Chris, you're in the Netherlands, Bill, we'll get to everybody.
[01:00:19.372 --> 01:00:20.612]  David in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:00:20.633 --> 01:00:22.593]  Alex, what's up?
[01:00:23.434 --> 01:00:26.475]  We are doing a worldwide transmission against global tyranny right now.
[01:00:27.338 --> 01:00:28.579]  That's awesome.
[01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:31.501]  Like I said last time I called, you need to get a show up here in Minnesota.
[01:00:31.621 --> 01:00:37.524]  Fox News has got a show now on like 100FM, and it's disgusting to hear what they have to say on a daily basis.
[01:00:38.585 --> 01:00:44.028]  But the reason I'm calling in is I want to make sure that you know, too, that Democrats and Liberals aren't your enemies either.
[01:00:44.548 --> 01:00:55.395]  We have a candidate up there as well, Mike Rabelle, who's also a Truther, who's also trying to expose the 9-11 movement, and I hope that if Ron Paul for some reason gets a ticket, maybe we can get Mike Rabelle in there.
[01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:59.323]  Look, I'm not saying liberals as the people are bad.
[01:00:59.864 --> 01:01:09.832]  I'm saying just like conservatives are good people, I mean, they're good people on the street, they're good to go eat a hamburger with or go to a ball game, but they're cult members when it comes to still defending Bush when he's a criminal.
[01:01:10.472 --> 01:01:12.494]  And I watched that under Bill Clinton with liberals.
[01:01:13.194 --> 01:01:19.179]  And I'm just saying that Hillary's going to get into office if Ron Paul doesn't, because there's no... because Republicans are totally shot.
[01:01:19.539 --> 01:01:21.100]  Everybody hates them, even their own party.
[01:01:21.461 --> 01:01:23.182]  Republicans are all going to support Obama.
[01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:29.372]  I mean, that's my point, is that our only hope is Ron Paul, or we're going to get Hillary, brother, and she's a warmonger.
[01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:30.613]  Oh, man.
[01:01:30.813 --> 01:01:33.595]  I mean, everyone that I know, she's a candidate no one wants.
[01:01:33.895 --> 01:01:34.855]  No one wants Hillary.
[01:01:35.135 --> 01:01:35.456]  No one.
[01:01:35.476 --> 01:01:41.439]  The other thing I want to say really quick, too, is I know we get attacked a lot by the law and legal fronts.
[01:01:41.959 --> 01:01:44.721]  I'm not sure if you guys have heard about this or not, either, but something called prepaid legal.
[01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:51.054]  I think it's like 17 bucks a month and what it does is it gives you like trial defense and all this lawyers at hand for a pretty good cost.
[01:01:51.194 --> 01:01:53.356]  Have you ever gotten in trouble and used them?
[01:01:53.396 --> 01:01:54.057]  Did it work for you?
[01:01:54.597 --> 01:01:55.458]  Yeah, it actually does.
[01:01:55.478 --> 01:02:04.424]  They even give you like this 24-axis 7-card where if you get pulled over by the cops you can call them with a phone number and you can have a lawyer talk you through exactly what to say and what not to say.
[01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:09.128]  So maybe if you're getting attacked on a legal front you can call them up and it's a really good deal.
[01:02:09.909 --> 01:02:12.991]  So are you doing that multi-level thing with them?
[01:02:13.979 --> 01:02:17.000]  Yeah, it's just kind of off the level, but I mean, I didn't pick it up because of that.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:17.980]  I didn't pick it up to make money.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.620]  I just pick it up because every time I hear someone... I understand.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.421]  No, I hear you.
[01:02:21.461 --> 01:02:23.321]  I was just curious if you were involved in that.
[01:02:23.361 --> 01:02:23.861]  Thank you, David.
[01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:24.721]  Appreciate it.
[01:02:24.761 --> 01:02:25.442]  Keep it up there.
[01:02:26.122 --> 01:02:27.302]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[01:02:27.322 --> 01:02:27.942]  You're on the air.
[01:02:27.982 --> 01:02:28.262]  Welcome.
[01:02:28.302 --> 01:02:29.242]  You've got about a minute and a half.
[01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:32.103]  Ron Paul is such a great example.
[01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:37.084]  I remember he brought my attention to the Federal Reserve issue back in the early 90s.
[01:02:37.584 --> 01:02:40.105]  He's just a great example of what you can do when you're a leader.
[01:02:41.874 --> 01:02:50.879]  You know, I want people to understand the spiritual principle that you attract what you fear, because you fear the unknown, so you attract the unknown.
[01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:54.081]  And that's what Ron Paul doesn't fear, is death.
[01:02:54.701 --> 01:02:56.723]  And that's why he's been able to get so far.
[01:02:56.743 --> 01:02:57.963]  I have two questions.
[01:02:58.063 --> 01:03:01.205]  What were the names of the officers who arrested Lew Brudowski?
[01:03:03.194 --> 01:03:04.535]  We cannot find their names.
[01:03:04.595 --> 01:03:08.137]  We posted their video that they detained him for an hour, claimed he was under arrest.
[01:03:08.157 --> 01:03:10.199]  So I guess in a way that is an arrest.
[01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:13.461]  And for those that don't know, they walk up and say, we know you've got a bomb.
[01:03:13.481 --> 01:03:16.543]  And then they say, we know you don't have one, but we're just going to say you have a bomb.
[01:03:16.763 --> 01:03:24.709]  That'd be like a cop opening his jacket, pulling out cocaine on video and going, lookie what I found here and planting it on you.
[01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:30.054]  He could have had a wire, a hand-free cell phone, you know, that's what the wires could have been.
[01:03:30.074 --> 01:03:31.495]  I mean, that's a common household item.
[01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:41.743]  My other question was, what, you know, popular mechanics used a doctored photo, you said, of Building 7, where supposedly 20% of the foundation was hollowed out.
[01:03:42.324 --> 01:03:44.426]  I wanted to know where they got that photo.
[01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:46.808]  Was it doctored, or was it... Sure, sure.
[01:03:46.828 --> 01:03:47.388]  We got a break.
[01:03:47.408 --> 01:03:48.069]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:48.089 --> 01:03:48.649]  We'll come back.
[01:03:48.669 --> 01:03:49.450]  Everybody stay with us.
[01:03:56.906 --> 01:04:02.352]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.733 --> 01:04:10.381]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:18.128]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.508 --> 01:04:29.934]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.254 --> 01:04:34.177]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.217 --> 01:04:36.138]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.478 --> 01:04:40.320]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:56.744 --> 01:06:01.969]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:07.614]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:07.974 --> 01:06:09.075]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:09.435 --> 01:06:18.501]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[01:07:22.522 --> 01:07:24.864]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:07:27.006 --> 01:07:41.796]  Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[01:07:46.887 --> 01:08:12.284]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news My head's been wet with the midnight dew I've been down on bended knee Talking to the man from Galilee He spoke to me in a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels He called my name and my heart stood still When he said, John, go do my will Go tell that long-tongued liar
[01:08:13.144 --> 01:08:41.534]  Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down You can run on for a long time Run on for a long time Run on for a long time Sooner or later, God'll cut you down Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
[01:08:43.664 --> 01:08:58.136]  Well, he may throw you a rock and hide your hand Working in the dark against your fellow man But he's sure as God, made black and white What's done in the dark will be brought to the light You can run on for a long time
[01:08:58.796 --> 01:09:11.144]  Run on for a long time, run on for a long time, sooner or later it's gonna cut you down, sooner or later it's gonna cut you down.
[01:09:12.225 --> 01:09:17.348]  Go tell that long-tongued liar, go and tell that midnight rider,
[01:09:17.968 --> 01:09:20.590]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:26.995]  We're working on getting the folks from a population reduction group on.
[01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:28.516]  We talked to them this morning.
[01:09:28.536 --> 01:09:29.917]  They were scheduled.
[01:09:47.353 --> 01:09:59.059]  They're not on the show with us right now because we're unable to connect with the phone number we have to England, but they'll probably be popping in later in the show, if not today, tomorrow, because there's lots of these organizations and groups.
[01:09:59.359 --> 01:10:07.604]  John Gillibond is the co-chairman of OPT and Emeritus Professor of Family Planning at University College London.
[01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:16.387]  And he said, the effect on the planet of having one less child is an order of magnitude greater than all the other things we might do, such as switching off lights.
[01:10:16.507 --> 01:10:19.970]  An extra child is equivalent of a lot of flights across the planet.
[01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:23.292]  So see, they want to make it an eco-crime to have children.
[01:10:23.633 --> 01:10:28.176]  Having large families is an eco-crime, is the headline.
[01:10:28.236 --> 01:10:35.682]  And we were going to have Valerie Stevens on, who is with the group.
[01:10:37.472 --> 01:10:42.576]  And then we will have her or others on from across the pond.
[01:10:43.136 --> 01:11:03.472]  There's a lot of groups pushing this and saying this, and the media likes to report on them and act like it's some minority view, but Dr. Pionka, right here at the University of Texas, goes around and gives speeches, and he gets standing ovations, not at the end of the speech, but when he says, get rid of 90%, with the image of skulls behind him saying, we need it to start, we just need the dying to start now.
[01:11:04.531 --> 01:11:07.793]  And then his students and graduate students say that everyone must die.
[01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:12.715]  So see, the carbon tax is a big, big deal.
[01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:16.657]  It isn't just going to stop with a tax on carbon.
[01:11:18.038 --> 01:11:19.818]  It's going to be on your carbon footprint.
[01:11:19.858 --> 01:11:23.160]  Of course, it's all based on a lie and a fraud.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.021]  Did that number work for you that time?
[01:11:28.483 --> 01:11:28.703]  Yeah.
[01:11:29.463 --> 01:11:30.924]  Yeah, from here I'm able to dial it.
[01:11:30.944 --> 01:11:31.424]  It's busy.
[01:11:32.842 --> 01:11:44.488]  Well, what we need to do is, so this doesn't go on, we need to call the organization, the progenitor, the main group again, and ask for backup numbers, is the move that needs to be made now.
[01:11:44.508 --> 01:11:49.110]  I'm not trying to do this stuff on air, but it's the only way we can do it here, time-wise.
[01:11:50.271 --> 01:12:00.716]  So, that's the move that needs to be made on that, because I really want to get this group on, and they'll end up getting their heads up on the show over time if we don't get them on today.
[01:12:02.219 --> 01:12:09.121]  Getting these type of people on is always a hassle, even without technical schisms and things that go on.
[01:12:10.041 --> 01:12:14.022]  I'm told that we have a caller who disagrees with us, though.
[01:12:14.922 --> 01:12:16.123]  Is that Bill in Illinois?
[01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.163]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:12:19.204 --> 01:12:19.904]  Go ahead, Bill.
[01:12:19.924 --> 01:12:20.824]  Hi, Alex.
[01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:28.426]  First, I want to say that I am a Ron Paul supporter, and I want to thank you for teaching me to become conscientious and aware.
[01:12:29.406 --> 01:12:37.591]  The question I have for you is, I believe the other day you said that they know how to play us like a fiddle, is what you said.
[01:12:38.571 --> 01:12:40.372]  Please don't jump on me if that's incorrect.
[01:12:40.732 --> 01:12:42.173]  Look man, stop prefacing.
[01:12:42.213 --> 01:12:43.814]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[01:12:44.895 --> 01:12:47.956]  Listen, this isn't Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or Neil Bortzer.
[01:12:47.976 --> 01:12:53.659]  You don't have to call in prefacing and saying you like me first and saying please don't jump on me.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:55.060]  Just say whatever you want, man.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.002]  Okay, Ron Paul looks too good to be true.
[01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:02.351]  If something looks too good to be true, it's a little catchy.
[01:13:02.731 --> 01:13:05.571]  I love Ron Paul, but I'm being very cautious.
[01:13:05.591 --> 01:13:07.132]  Can you please clear this up for me?
[01:13:09.512 --> 01:13:09.752]  No.
[01:13:10.212 --> 01:13:10.953]  I'm not going to.
[01:13:10.973 --> 01:13:11.913]  There's nothing to clear up.
[01:13:13.493 --> 01:13:17.514]  I mean, this is what... You're going to play us like a fiddle like the rest of the government.
[01:13:17.534 --> 01:13:18.414]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:13:18.734 --> 01:13:19.094]  Thank you.
[01:13:19.114 --> 01:13:20.255]  That's what I thought you wanted to hear.
[01:13:20.815 --> 01:13:22.375]  So I told you.
[01:13:22.595 --> 01:13:22.795]  See?
[01:13:23.495 --> 01:13:25.876]  I'm just so sick of it, man.
[01:13:25.996 --> 01:13:27.056]  I'm just so sick.
[01:13:28.193 --> 01:13:32.637]  Of the attitude that is out there.
[01:13:34.298 --> 01:13:35.919]  I mean, there's just nothing to say.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.501]  People don't have any gauge.
[01:13:40.202 --> 01:13:41.804]  Of course I can say something.
[01:13:42.304 --> 01:13:49.269]  You see, the main statement from the listener is, see, I'm playing him like a fiddle now.
[01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:52.252]  I'm playing everyone like a fiddle.
[01:13:52.272 --> 01:13:53.272]  See, I'm bad, too.
[01:13:55.425 --> 01:14:00.346]  And I sensed that in the whole way the question was asked, so I just gave them what they want.
[01:14:00.366 --> 01:14:03.547]  A lot of times you've just got to give people what they want.
[01:14:04.227 --> 01:14:07.688]  And if that's what they want, then they can have that.
[01:14:08.928 --> 01:14:20.491]  All I hear out of a large segment of this movement, and it's the anchor holding us back in so many ways, is instant and total and complete denial of any hope
[01:14:21.434 --> 01:14:31.818]  Of any idea that we can beat City Hall, of any idea that we can have a victory, of any idea that we can ever effect change, of any idea that we could ever get anything done.
[01:14:34.038 --> 01:14:37.920]  And that's the first thing that's always put out.
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:42.081]  That's the first thing that we always hear.
[01:14:43.301 --> 01:14:44.902]  That's the first thing
[01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:48.397]  Okay, come on in.
[01:14:48.458 --> 01:14:48.858]  I don't know.
[01:14:48.878 --> 01:14:50.300]  I don't know about the guest.
[01:14:50.781 --> 01:14:51.962]  You say you were able to get a hold of her?
[01:14:53.304 --> 01:14:54.506]  It rings and you just talked to her.
[01:14:54.526 --> 01:14:56.468]  Okay, well give the network that number.
[01:14:56.488 --> 01:14:56.829]  You know what?
[01:14:59.052 --> 01:15:00.093]  You told them how you dialed it.
[01:15:00.193 --> 01:15:01.034]  Let's just do this.
[01:15:01.555 --> 01:15:02.837]  It's probably the network phone system.
[01:15:04.554 --> 01:15:06.295]  It's busy, so now he can call back.
[01:15:06.315 --> 01:15:07.636]  We'll just do producing on air, it's fine.
[01:15:08.496 --> 01:15:08.956]  That's fine.
[01:15:09.477 --> 01:15:11.918]  He says it doesn't work again, have her call into the network.
[01:15:12.438 --> 01:15:15.260]  Okay, in the back extension, or John will try to call again.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.520]  It's probably the network phone system.
[01:15:18.561 --> 01:15:19.622]  Classic stuff.
[01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:29.647]  Look folks, how this works is, you got people who do the work in the world, and then you got the people who look at the size of the problem and decide to never fix it.
[01:15:31.503 --> 01:15:38.449]  And I'm not saying that we shouldn't go out and try to support Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:40.730]  Okay?
[01:15:40.971 --> 01:15:45.294]  And I'm not saying that we shouldn't go out and investigate Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:15:46.315 --> 01:15:48.576]  But you have to judge a tree by its roots.
[01:15:49.477 --> 01:15:59.425]  And we've got our guest now, so later I will try to walk through the caller's question.
[01:16:00.402 --> 01:16:07.044]  It's just the whole spirit of the thing made me nauseous and I'm just taken back by this stuff sometimes.
[01:16:09.305 --> 01:16:10.445]  Just by the attitude.
[01:16:11.426 --> 01:16:14.027]  And so later I'll go over it.
[01:16:15.127 --> 01:16:18.228]  Just in the middle of all of the normal things that go on around here.
[01:16:18.268 --> 01:16:20.189]  It just makes my head spin sometimes.
[01:16:21.509 --> 01:16:23.330]  We do have her on with us.
[01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:27.556]  We appreciate her coming on the show.
[01:16:27.596 --> 01:16:28.697]  She's Valerie Stevens.
[01:16:29.077 --> 01:16:34.621]  She's the co-chair of OPT and that's the Optimum Population Group.
[01:16:34.802 --> 01:16:36.843]  Optimum Population dot O-R-G.
[01:16:37.564 --> 01:16:40.626]  And I'm sorry we had so much trouble connecting with you.
[01:16:40.686 --> 01:16:42.327]  It's good to have you on with us, Valerie.
[01:16:42.347 --> 01:16:43.608]  Thank you, that's okay.
[01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:48.172]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, about the organization that you co-chair.
[01:16:49.073 --> 01:16:52.876]  Well, it's basically an environmental think tank, if you like.
[01:16:52.936 --> 01:16:53.256]  We're all
[01:16:54.085 --> 01:17:01.288]  We're deeply concerned about the global environment and of course the environment in our very overcrowded island of the United Kingdom.
[01:17:01.308 --> 01:17:14.535]  And like the rest of the world, we're tremendously concerned about global climate change, global warming, based on the huge amounts of fossil fuels that we burn.
[01:17:16.104 --> 01:17:32.648]  And so I guess it's the same in some parts of the United States, but here in Britain and Europe we've been talking a great deal about what every citizen can do to try to cut down on each person's emissions of carbon dioxide.
[01:17:33.268 --> 01:17:37.549]  Changing the light bulbs, taking the bus instead of your car, this kind of thing.
[01:17:38.289 --> 01:17:44.271]  But because we're concerned about population impacts, our message is have one less child.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.861]  I do find that shocking.
[01:17:48.482 --> 01:17:49.123]  Well, don't worry.
[01:17:49.163 --> 01:17:50.884]  The West is already dead.
[01:17:51.264 --> 01:17:53.246]  And that will accelerate it.
[01:17:53.266 --> 01:18:00.451]  In fact, you guys are saying the Westerners are the ones that really don't need to have children because our carbon footprint is so big.
[01:18:01.151 --> 01:18:03.873]  And there's talk about it being fines or fees.
[01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:06.315]  That really is the one-child policy of China.
[01:18:06.355 --> 01:18:08.276]  But I know I would say victory is complete.
[01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:11.139]  I mean, the West already pretty much can't reverse its decline.
[01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:19.286]  Nowhere in anything that we say on our website have we talked about fines or anything like that.
[01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:23.809]  It must all be voluntary based on people's awareness of what's happening.
[01:18:23.929 --> 01:18:25.330]  It's talking about taxes.
[01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:26.671]  It's talking about penalties.
[01:18:26.711 --> 01:18:27.952]  I mean, I have the Times of London.
[01:18:27.972 --> 01:18:30.454]  I have Australian News.
[01:18:31.094 --> 01:18:33.816]  I mean, explain it to us, because I'm really honored that...
[01:18:34.296 --> 01:18:35.177]  Well, man, we've got a break.
[01:18:35.638 --> 01:18:41.264]  Quick break, and I really appreciate your stalwart stoicism while we didn't get connected to you for 17 minutes.
[01:18:41.764 --> 01:18:42.265]  Stay there.
[01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:48.912]  We appreciate you gracing us with your time, and we'll be right back to let you elaborate on this.
[01:18:49.032 --> 01:18:50.314]  Stay with us.
[01:18:56.061 --> 01:19:00.186]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:19:00.426 --> 01:19:02.188]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:19:02.448 --> 01:19:08.735]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:19:09.015 --> 01:19:15.162]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:19:15.402 --> 01:19:17.244]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:19:17.504 --> 01:19:17.925]  I think so.
[01:19:41.188 --> 01:19:44.509]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625 That's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[01:19:54.574 --> 01:19:58.419]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us up the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:19:58.459 --> 01:19:59.701]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:19:59.881 --> 01:20:03.446]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:20:03.746 --> 01:20:06.270]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:08.413]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:20:08.733 --> 01:20:10.896]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:20:12.097 --> 01:20:22.521]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:20:24.222 --> 01:20:26.503]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:20:26.583 --> 01:20:29.644]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:20:29.864 --> 01:20:32.326]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:20:32.406 --> 01:20:35.369]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[01:20:35.389 --> 01:20:36.090]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:20:36.190 --> 01:20:38.813]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:39.473]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:20:54.694 --> 01:21:03.762]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:21:04.022 --> 01:21:15.232]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:21:15.572 --> 01:21:21.297]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:21:21.617 --> 01:21:21.997]  I think?
[01:21:39.667 --> 01:21:41.268]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:21:41.308 --> 01:21:42.169]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.549]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:42.569 --> 01:21:43.971]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:21:54.299 --> 01:21:55.459]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[01:21:55.599 --> 01:21:57.880]  of the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.981]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:01.721]  is a real thing.
[01:22:01.801 --> 01:22:08.663]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[01:22:08.803 --> 01:22:14.064]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[01:22:14.244 --> 01:22:15.005]  We're good to go!
[01:22:41.064 --> 01:22:44.787]  Secure online ordering is available at NutraMedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[01:22:44.967 --> 01:22:49.852]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[01:22:49.992 --> 01:22:52.794]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:22:54.396 --> 01:22:59.540]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.221 --> 01:23:02.563]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:03.203 --> 01:23:04.685]  We have the co-chair,
[01:23:05.923 --> 01:23:07.984]  ...of the Optimum Population Trust.
[01:23:10.706 --> 01:23:13.047]  And she joins us, Valerie Stephens.
[01:23:13.747 --> 01:23:22.772]  Valerie, you say nowhere on your website should you say that it's an eco-crime, but the headline in the Sunday Times of London is, having large families is an eco-crime.
[01:23:23.452 --> 01:23:26.634]  How do you think that they came up with that headline?
[01:23:27.134 --> 01:23:28.014]  I've no idea.
[01:23:28.234 --> 01:23:31.216]  It's rather embarrassed us, because we wouldn't say
[01:23:31.886 --> 01:23:34.371]  Words like a crime at all.
[01:23:34.512 --> 01:23:37.157]  We're saying we want people to think about this issue.
[01:23:37.658 --> 01:23:38.981]  We do wonder about...
[01:23:39.811 --> 01:23:51.099]  The advisability of, you know, some governments in Europe and also in Australia are so concerned about low birth rates that they actually offer big bonuses and handouts if you have a say.
[01:23:51.139 --> 01:23:52.280]  But see, that won't work.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.861]  You guys are actually helping us.
[01:23:54.521 --> 01:23:55.662]  And I appreciate you.
[01:23:55.982 --> 01:23:56.943]  Put your billboards up.
[01:23:56.983 --> 01:23:58.364]  Start taxing having kids.
[01:23:59.605 --> 01:24:00.726]  People like to rebel.
[01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:06.089]  And so, as soon as you make it stylish to have more children, you're actually going to save the beloved West.
[01:24:06.210 --> 01:24:07.991]  So, I just want to thank you.
[01:24:08.491 --> 01:24:10.313]  We're going to win.
[01:24:10.353 --> 01:24:11.093]  We can't be stopped.
[01:24:11.113 --> 01:24:11.814]  You seem to know that.
[01:24:12.874 --> 01:24:20.640]  Well, when you say the West, are you including Europe with the USA?
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:21.361]  Yes.
[01:24:21.381 --> 01:24:22.201]  Yeah.
[01:24:22.461 --> 01:24:25.163]  I mean, we have quite different... And Japan, too.
[01:24:25.223 --> 01:24:27.085]  I don't want the Japanese to become extinct.
[01:24:28.206 --> 01:24:30.167]  We don't want anybody to become extinct.
[01:24:30.227 --> 01:24:33.910]  I'll tell you what our bottom line is.
[01:24:34.483 --> 01:24:50.011]  That we think that the number of births each year should be roughly equal to the number of deaths so that we're not having 80 million more people on the planet every year all of them using energy all of them emitting or
[01:24:51.951 --> 01:25:04.708]  But you cannot deny that China has now surpassed the United States in carbon footprint emissions, and they're not putting in any of these controls.
[01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:07.691]  Well, I was going to stop you.
[01:25:07.831 --> 01:25:13.614]  Except for the beloved one-child policy, which is the law and there are fines associated.
[01:25:13.834 --> 01:25:15.855]  Do you think that's a sensible thing we're doing in China?
[01:25:15.915 --> 01:25:16.336]  I do.
[01:25:16.536 --> 01:25:22.799]  Actually, I think the world would be in a really terrible mess now if the Chinese had not instituted that one-child policy.
[01:25:22.839 --> 01:25:23.679]  Okay, so there you go.
[01:25:23.699 --> 01:25:24.660]  There you go right there.
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:30.203]  Is that you say you don't want it to be the law and don't want fines, but you really do in the end of the day.
[01:25:30.863 --> 01:25:32.864]  Not in the Western democracies.
[01:25:32.944 --> 01:25:34.984]  No, that has to be the choice of the people.
[01:25:35.025 --> 01:25:38.126]  We have free votes and we can choose that kind of thing.
[01:25:38.146 --> 01:25:40.866]  But you support China doing it in the barrel of a gun?
[01:25:41.047 --> 01:25:42.087]  I think China has to do it.
[01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:50.970]  The number of people in China who would have starved by now, died of starvation, even with their one-child policy for the past 15 years,
[01:25:52.094 --> 01:25:52.575]  Yes.
[01:25:52.955 --> 01:25:55.458]  They are totally running out of water.
[01:25:55.498 --> 01:25:57.581]  Part of their country is becoming an absolute disaster.
[01:25:57.601 --> 01:25:58.222]  No, that's not true.
[01:25:58.302 --> 01:25:59.163]  I've seen all the numbers.
[01:25:59.363 --> 01:25:59.584]  No.
[01:25:59.624 --> 01:26:06.993]  Well, you know, if they'd not have the one-child policy before now, millions and millions of them would have starved.
[01:26:07.193 --> 01:26:12.834]  Well, you know, Mao admits he killed 60 mil in the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.
[01:26:13.154 --> 01:26:14.595]  That's an official government publication.
[01:26:14.615 --> 01:26:15.235]  They're very proud of it.
[01:26:15.555 --> 01:26:18.355]  An official government publication is the mass culling.
[01:26:18.415 --> 01:26:20.196]  They're the apple of the UN's eye.
[01:26:20.516 --> 01:26:26.397]  They get all the big awards, and it's the government planning that has caused the problems.
[01:26:26.437 --> 01:26:30.098]  They can easily increase their yield and feed their population.
[01:26:30.858 --> 01:26:40.821]  I think you have not looked at the way their water table they're receiving because they've been over pumped and I know that parts of the USA... They have the ocean.
[01:26:40.841 --> 01:26:43.162]  They could build desalination.
[01:26:43.402 --> 01:26:44.802]  Humans can do whatever's needed.
[01:26:45.302 --> 01:26:47.623]  And desalination plant uses...
[01:26:48.263 --> 01:26:48.743]  I think so.
[01:27:07.169 --> 01:27:10.611]  After warming begins, carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.
[01:27:10.811 --> 01:27:12.031]  It is a life accelerant.
[01:27:12.251 --> 01:27:14.552]  Plants grow even faster and more healthy.
[01:27:14.872 --> 01:27:23.536]  In our ancient past, we had a higher carbon dioxide level in photosynthesis, boosting total oxygen levels for all of the different types of animal life.
[01:27:23.716 --> 01:27:26.077]  That is a scientific hoax and a fraud!
[01:27:26.944 --> 01:27:37.807]  No, I think you will see that the bulk of scientists around the world are aggrieved that global climate change is happening and it is probably due to... Probably.
[01:27:37.827 --> 01:27:44.109]  You guys were saying all scientists just six months ago till they all started going public about the lies!
[01:27:44.809 --> 01:27:47.110]  Now you gotta say bulk of scientists.
[01:27:47.130 --> 01:27:55.272]  It's a very small number of scientists who are saying that Al Gore's wrong or all these other
[01:27:56.224 --> 01:27:58.085]  Uh, scientists around the world are wrong.
[01:27:58.145 --> 01:28:01.367]  It is a very small number who are countering this.
[01:28:01.507 --> 01:28:02.007]  Oh, really?
[01:28:02.628 --> 01:28:03.008]  Oh, yeah.
[01:28:03.248 --> 01:28:05.530]  Oh, what's your study or a major index on that?
[01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:08.871]  Um... I mean, what's your proof?
[01:28:09.012 --> 01:28:09.752]  Let me see your proof.
[01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:16.054]  In science, in New Scientist, these magazines that reflect the scientific community.
[01:28:16.074 --> 01:28:19.576]  That are owned by the oil companies that want to have a global carbon tax.
[01:28:19.616 --> 01:28:21.998]  We have the Bilderberg Group and SPT Documents.
[01:28:22.018 --> 01:28:23.399]  This is a giant hoax.
[01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:24.640]  Peak Oil is a hoax.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.121]  And we have the documents and we're going to get it out to the people.
[01:28:27.361 --> 01:28:29.303]  Tell you what, I'm going to shut up and I'm going to be polite.
[01:28:29.323 --> 01:28:30.043]  I've got a little angry.
[01:28:30.063 --> 01:28:31.564]  I'm not being gentlemanly.
[01:28:31.624 --> 01:28:32.585]  I apologize to you.
[01:28:32.925 --> 01:28:34.326]  One more little segment with us please.
[01:28:34.546 --> 01:28:37.368]  I'd like to hear then what we should do if you're right.
[01:28:37.648 --> 01:28:38.429]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.004 --> 01:28:47.013]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.935 --> 01:28:50.623]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.821 --> 01:29:05.831]  JLS Research, the makers of all natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:12.537]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[01:29:12.717 --> 01:29:20.364]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[01:29:20.604 --> 01:29:21.305]  As it responds,
[01:29:21.565 --> 01:29:23.567]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[01:29:23.867 --> 01:29:27.370]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[01:29:27.670 --> 01:29:30.952]  Grape seed skim, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[01:29:31.313 --> 01:29:35.796]  It's so effective, you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[01:29:36.096 --> 01:29:38.638]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[01:29:38.918 --> 01:29:41.020]  Go online and order First Responder at No-BO.com.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:42.902]  Visit No-BO.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[01:29:48.846 --> 01:29:49.046]  That's 850-723-8599.
[01:29:54.702 --> 01:29:58.485]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[01:29:58.865 --> 01:30:06.131]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:17.581]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:30:17.661 --> 01:30:18.121]  Central.
[01:30:18.461 --> 01:30:24.066]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:30:24.386 --> 01:30:30.288]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:30:30.789 --> 01:30:35.530]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:30:35.911 --> 01:30:40.692]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:30:41.133 --> 01:30:42.453]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:30:42.513 --> 01:30:42.933]  Central.
[01:30:43.513 --> 01:30:50.916]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[01:30:54.332 --> 01:30:58.176]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:30:58.436 --> 01:31:02.299]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:07.684]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[01:31:07.965 --> 01:31:19.175]  Electrolyzed plus water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[01:31:19.475 --> 01:31:23.816]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[01:31:24.076 --> 01:31:33.398]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water, but not tap water, microstructured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[01:31:33.558 --> 01:31:43.180]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Miracle Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel Sport Performance Drink at 888-212-8871
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:49.761]  That's 888-212-8871 or go to Nutramedical.com.
[01:31:49.941 --> 01:31:52.762]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I, medical.com.
[01:31:53.702 --> 01:31:57.883]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:25.679]  We are graced and honored to have Valerie Stevens of the Optimum Population Trust joining us.
[01:32:27.296 --> 01:32:29.597]  Optimumpopulation.org.
[01:32:29.997 --> 01:32:44.042]  Okay, without me, then, sitting here running over you, you say you support what China's doing, but that we're democracies, so we can't do that here, but you don't support a tax, or it being the law to reduce children, or the number of births, and I'm...
[01:32:44.462 --> 01:32:46.303]  We're going to have more children just because of this, by the way.
[01:32:47.523 --> 01:32:48.584]  Because we will survive.
[01:32:48.604 --> 01:32:49.384]  We will continue.
[01:32:50.004 --> 01:32:52.626]  And we are not a cancer on the Earth, as Prince Philip has called us.
[01:32:52.906 --> 01:33:04.691]  But, I mean, explain to us, then, that paradox between what China's doing is good, but we're not going to do that here, but you're just introducing us to it, and how evil our carbon footprint is.
[01:33:06.283 --> 01:33:09.925]  I think perhaps we confront to it from a slightly different point of view.
[01:33:09.965 --> 01:33:15.208]  Remember that in the United Kingdom we're even more densely populated than China.
[01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:21.672]  We are struggling with a population of 60 million on this tiny island and
[01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:27.946]  Our numbers are still growing by about a quarter of a million every year.
[01:33:28.046 --> 01:33:28.907]  Illegal aliens?
[01:33:29.307 --> 01:33:32.809]  Your actual birth rate is 1.5, you're dying.
[01:33:32.829 --> 01:33:34.449]  1.78 actually.
[01:33:34.509 --> 01:33:37.431]  Well then I guess the BBC's lying.
[01:33:38.331 --> 01:33:41.413]  I think they're integrating second generation foreigners.
[01:33:42.213 --> 01:33:49.417]  If you actually look at real populations there, the Germanic Mongol tribes,
[01:33:51.798 --> 01:34:02.242]  And by Mongol tribes, you know, an amalgamation of the Germanic and Norse populations, Romantic invasions, that it's actually at about 1.3, but go ahead.
[01:34:03.402 --> 01:34:04.643]  Right.
[01:34:05.203 --> 01:34:12.785]  We are still concerned about the way in which our cities are encroaching on Greenbelt in this country.
[01:34:16.106 --> 01:34:18.667]  And we see that happening all over Europe.
[01:34:18.867 --> 01:34:20.568]  The spread of a dense
[01:34:21.164 --> 01:34:24.945]  Populations in industrialized countries.
[01:34:25.805 --> 01:34:34.368]  We're desperately worried about the kind of future that our children and grandchildren are going to face.
[01:34:35.188 --> 01:34:47.452]  I can't imagine, Mr. Jones, that you think it's a welcome thing in the world today that is running out of resources to have 80 million more people on the planet every year.
[01:34:47.652 --> 01:34:49.032]  I really cannot
[01:34:49.787 --> 01:34:51.848]  I don't understand how anybody can say that.
[01:34:51.928 --> 01:35:08.797]  Well the problem is that I have literally decades of research on this subject and I know that once third world nations industrialize that their population growth will go down to zero immediately.
[01:35:08.817 --> 01:35:15.221]  Well no, it can't go immediately because the people, even if all the couples in third world countries
[01:35:15.871 --> 01:35:17.932]  Only have one child per couple.
[01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:20.992]  By immediately, I mean as soon as they industrialize.
[01:35:21.892 --> 01:35:27.174]  Even if they did it tomorrow, the number of... Let me just finish.
[01:35:27.194 --> 01:35:32.495]  The UN's own studies say that population will grow to nine and a half billion and then start declining.
[01:35:32.835 --> 01:35:36.656]  That's two and a half billion more than we have now.
[01:35:36.696 --> 01:35:41.597]  That cannot be good for a planet that already overshoots its renewable
[01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:44.518]  Here's the problem, ma'am.
[01:35:44.678 --> 01:35:45.898]  Ma'am, here's the problem.
[01:35:46.298 --> 01:35:47.939]  I have the oil company documents.
[01:35:48.079 --> 01:35:50.179]  They're behind the whole fake environmental movement.
[01:35:50.579 --> 01:35:53.680]  The environmental movement is nothing more than neo-feudalism and serfdom.
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:36:09.404]  Actually, there's few countries in the world that have more green space and more held lands and palaces for your royalty, and that basically you're still in a feudal model with very few landowners, with massive pressure to steal the land of the farmers,
[01:36:10.084 --> 01:36:29.248]  uh... that are still there and all the harassment they go under uh... and uh... that and that we haven't this is nothing but malthusian social darwinism are you familiar with prince philip is a big supporter i know your foundation and other groups saying he wants to come back as a virus to kill eighty percent of us?
[01:36:31.289 --> 01:36:38.050]  I'm absolutely flabbergasted Mr. Jones, he couldn't even be bothered to talk to me since my
[01:36:38.877 --> 01:36:47.199]  Background, it is obviously so obnoxious to you, perhaps I should just put the phone down and say, maybe we'll talk another time.
[01:36:47.279 --> 01:36:48.699]  Well, what do you know about Prince Philip?
[01:36:50.159 --> 01:36:51.240]  Goodbye, Mr. Jones.
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.860]  Oh man, that really got to her right there.
[01:36:56.161 --> 01:36:58.001]  Goodbye, Mr. Jones.
[01:36:58.721 --> 01:37:01.722]  We'll be dealing with you soon enough.
[01:37:08.801 --> 01:37:09.722]  Oh my God.
[01:37:09.742 --> 01:37:11.284]  Oh my God.
[01:37:13.446 --> 01:37:15.328]  And of course he showed us his true colors.
[01:37:16.309 --> 01:37:21.395]  He showed us his true colors.
[01:37:21.415 --> 01:37:21.775]  What was it?
[01:37:21.875 --> 01:37:22.896]  Six years ago now?
[01:37:23.817 --> 01:37:30.004]  Whenever the head of the 700 Club, Pat Robertson, said on CNN, China's doing what it has to do
[01:37:31.162 --> 01:37:34.705]  with abortion and even forced abortion in China.
[01:37:34.725 --> 01:37:35.906]  He goes, what are they going to do?
[01:37:36.787 --> 01:37:37.947]  They have to.
[01:37:38.808 --> 01:37:40.529]  Yes, and he gave a clarification.
[01:37:40.549 --> 01:37:42.671]  He said, they've got to have it, Morse.
[01:37:45.253 --> 01:37:51.718]  Once you give in to that view, once you let the government be the arbiter of human life and decide who can live and who can't.
[01:37:51.978 --> 01:37:53.639]  We already have eugenics of our old.
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:58.603]  We already have all this rapid family planning with the goal of destroying the family.
[01:37:59.841 --> 01:38:02.083]  We actually have, and that's U.N.
[01:38:02.143 --> 01:38:03.984]  extreme numbers show 9.5 billion.
[01:38:04.304 --> 01:38:07.006]  The numbers are really showing it will probably plane off at about 8 billion.
[01:38:07.686 --> 01:38:12.509]  We go up in an airplane over many areas of the world, it's completely unpopulated.
[01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:17.252]  England is barely populated.
[01:38:18.553 --> 01:38:27.559]  You bring up Prince Philip to these people, who's a big supporter of the views espoused by the group you just heard, and bringing up the Prince is a no-no.
[01:38:29.042 --> 01:38:33.105]  And he did write the foreword to If I Was an Animal, published 1988.
[01:38:33.145 --> 01:38:36.828]  Reuters also carried, they asked him about it and he repeated it.
[01:38:38.009 --> 01:38:40.711]  Autobahn Society questioned him, he repeated it and said more.
[01:38:41.171 --> 01:38:41.972]  These are on record.
[01:38:42.012 --> 01:38:44.134]  I actually own the book and the publications.
[01:38:45.675 --> 01:38:50.318]  And he says that he wants to see 80% of us die.
[01:38:51.119 --> 01:38:55.983]  And man, I brought that up and it was like producing a silver
[01:38:57.299 --> 01:39:00.081]  crucifix to Beelzebub himself.
[01:39:01.182 --> 01:39:25.761]  I mean it was as if you talk about specters vanishing and you see we know their game and it was all about everyone agrees the earth is overpopulated needs to be reduced everyone agrees the carbon emission is destroying everything and I go no actually it's the very ether in which we swim
[01:39:27.142 --> 01:39:33.206]  Carbon dioxide and oxygen are minority gases in the atmosphere.
[01:39:34.226 --> 01:39:45.693]  And all the major studies show that life, animal and plant, lives longer, accelerates, has better cell structures in a more oxygen and carbon dioxide rich environment.
[01:39:45.753 --> 01:39:47.875]  It is literally delicious!
[01:39:50.356 --> 01:39:56.600]  It is the life forms on this planet that are generating the atmosphere that perpetuates the life forms.
[01:39:59.004 --> 01:40:18.677]  Our atmosphere is actually also, some of it is lost into space while it's being bombarded by the ions and different particles coming in out of the galaxy and from the sun itself and that we're actually being stripped and losing oxygen despite the gravitational pull that holds in much of the gases.
[01:40:19.097 --> 01:40:28.380]  If we want to be like Mars and lose our atmosphere and die, then for heaven's sakes we want to try to manipulate and stop the normal processes.
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:41.865]  The UN's own report, which is inflated and proven to be a fraud, but again using their numbers, 6% of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by human activity.
[01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:54.398]  6% and that's including around half of that they claim methane gas emissions from the animal feeds and in the stomach.
[01:40:54.478 --> 01:40:55.299]  It's flatulence.
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:59.383]  That's why they want to start reducing and banning and taxing the cows.
[01:40:59.403 --> 01:41:03.947]  There's always been bovine ranging in even greater numbers than there are now in North America.
[01:41:04.847 --> 01:41:06.609]  They called them the buffalo.
[01:41:08.211 --> 01:41:10.473]  There were many species of deer extincted.
[01:41:10.753 --> 01:41:15.838]  There were many more types of the cloven-hooved animals running about as well.
[01:41:16.318 --> 01:41:17.919]  And they were knocked out.
[01:41:17.939 --> 01:41:19.341]  There was over-hunting.
[01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:21.503]  There is over-fishing and over-hunting.
[01:41:21.823 --> 01:41:24.385]  And I don't like a lot of old-growth forests being cut down.
[01:41:24.525 --> 01:41:26.387]  I believe in preserving our Earth.
[01:41:26.907 --> 01:41:33.411]  But let me tell you, every time they take some farmer's ranch with this stuff, it's to build a hotel or golf course five years later.
[01:41:33.792 --> 01:41:38.775]  Every time they take a community's marina, they build a five-star marina there.
[01:41:39.335 --> 01:41:40.296]  And condos.
[01:41:40.916 --> 01:41:42.437]  It is about stealing property.
[01:41:42.517 --> 01:41:43.818]  It is neo-feudalism.
[01:41:47.049 --> 01:41:49.511]  Goodbye, Mr. Jones.
[01:41:50.152 --> 01:41:58.459]  I will now exercise the power and the authority to terminate this interview because you have brought up His Royal Highness!
[01:42:00.561 --> 01:42:02.803]  How dare you bring him up!
[01:42:03.423 --> 01:42:04.784]  How dare you!
[01:42:05.885 --> 01:42:10.129]  How dare you bring up His Royal Highness!
[01:42:11.997 --> 01:42:17.221]  He is such a wonderful individual, who has such a great vision, and you do!
[01:42:17.501 --> 01:42:22.044]  You pathetic, backwards, country bumpkin Yankee!
[01:42:23.305 --> 01:42:25.587]  We've got real intellect!
[01:42:26.007 --> 01:42:29.050]  We've got real understanding over here!
[01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:31.952]  We've had all of society!
[01:42:38.553 --> 01:42:42.597]  She couldn't stand it when I told her we're gonna win, and we are, we're gonna ace them.
[01:42:43.938 --> 01:42:48.882]  You're not gonna stop the human spirit, and you're not gonna stop its dynamic agility.
[01:42:50.203 --> 01:42:51.424]  We're gonna unlock it!
[01:42:52.225 --> 01:42:55.828]  And we're gonna run over the top of you and all of your elk!
[01:42:56.549 --> 01:42:59.552]  And we're gonna spread into the heavens!
[01:43:00.783 --> 01:43:19.259]  Our offspring are going to inherit, and they're going to inherit God's incredible promises and the wonders we've been promised, and we're not going to be blocked by the likes of you that have tried to cull our population, and who have tried to reduce our numbers, and who have tried to control us forever.
[01:43:20.419 --> 01:43:21.921]  They're the feudal managers.
[01:43:23.701 --> 01:43:30.504]  And all their simpering sales jobs have failed, and they're going to fail miserably!
[01:43:30.744 --> 01:43:33.226]  You will never stop the true renaissance!
[01:43:33.586 --> 01:43:39.008]  You will never stop our ever moving forward as a species!
[01:43:40.489 --> 01:43:41.169]  I say they won't.
[01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:42.890]  They may release some super weapon.
[01:43:43.170 --> 01:43:44.251]  I don't mean their pathetic group.
[01:43:44.271 --> 01:43:45.752]  They're useful idiots, I'm sure mean well.
[01:43:45.952 --> 01:43:50.594]  But I mean the military industrial complex, PNAC, the New World Order crowd, the Prince Philip type crowd.
[01:43:53.277 --> 01:43:57.079]  So I say, they won't stop us, and I know in my gut they're not going to.
[01:43:57.819 --> 01:44:00.601]  But I just, I just, it absolutely blows me away.
[01:44:00.621 --> 01:44:09.285]  You know, Dr. Pianca, let's kill everybody, let's use the Chinese model, uh, or kill 90%.
[01:44:10.265 --> 01:44:18.149]  And then, oh yes, China, I agree with them, but here we need to have a more, that's not the phase we're at yet.
[01:44:20.447 --> 01:44:23.350]  That was real high to support getting rid of the mass of the population.
[01:44:24.752 --> 01:44:28.296]  I think we're going to end this right now.
[01:44:28.316 --> 01:44:35.785]  I think we're going to stop this right here and right now, Mr. Jones!
[01:44:43.274 --> 01:44:49.857]  Again, I am not for setting up these death mills, like Margaret Singer, who gave awards to Hitler, got awards from him.
[01:44:50.237 --> 01:44:51.177]  That's where they learned it all.
[01:44:52.137 --> 01:44:54.778]  The Rockefeller Foundation funded the major Nazi eugenics.
[01:44:54.798 --> 01:44:56.699]  That's mainstream history, New York Times cover.
[01:44:56.979 --> 01:44:59.260]  We have all the articles, back in the 30s and 40s.
[01:45:00.901 --> 01:45:02.221]  You're not going to stop us.
[01:45:02.241 --> 01:45:08.243]  These death mills in the Hispanic and black areas, I don't want all their children to die.
[01:45:08.263 --> 01:45:09.444]  I don't want them killing their babies.
[01:45:11.475 --> 01:45:23.958]  You know, once they get a good socioeconomic level, they will go into actual negative population, because people are selfish and want to watch TV and want to go party and look at the pathetic white population.
[01:45:24.838 --> 01:45:30.340]  They've bought into all the lies and all the evil of the New World Order, and look at our communities falling apart en masse.
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:34.801]  And they say, oh yes, we must accelerate it in Europe.
[01:45:37.862 --> 01:45:39.242]  I mean, that's just disgusting!
[01:45:41.525 --> 01:45:42.765]  So I'm not a hypocrite about this.
[01:45:42.825 --> 01:45:46.086]  I don't want the blacks and the Mexicans to not have their children, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:46.346 --> 01:45:51.968]  But I gotta tell ya, I mean, just to watch the death of Europe, it's happening.
[01:45:52.088 --> 01:45:52.808]  Look at the numbers.
[01:45:53.868 --> 01:45:58.469]  And I hear the illegals celebrate it, and, hey, you're dying, go back to Europe, ha ha ha.
[01:45:58.849 --> 01:46:01.190]  Hey man, I don't want you to die, we're all human beings here.
[01:46:01.890 --> 01:46:09.732]  And see, you've bought into that whole attitude, and I just... It's just absolutely disgusting, and I've had enough of it.
[01:46:11.116 --> 01:46:12.696]  And we're going to expose these people.
[01:46:12.736 --> 01:46:14.517]  My new film is going to expose these people.
[01:46:16.397 --> 01:46:23.198]  And, you know, the caller earlier, I was actually sitting here mad that we hadn't got our guest on yet, that there was a problem.
[01:46:23.258 --> 01:46:28.960]  And so when the caller called in and said, Alex, and the caller might have meant well, but Alex, you know, it's just too good to be true.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.580]  And you say they can play us like a fiddle.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:34.621]  And, and, you know, Ron Paul is just too good to be true.
[01:46:34.681 --> 01:46:35.761]  And I just don't know what to,
[01:46:37.961 --> 01:46:39.501]  Okay, let's say Ron Paul's bad.
[01:46:39.541 --> 01:46:41.222]  He's some type of sleeper, which he isn't.
[01:46:41.662 --> 01:46:43.662]  But look at the fruit this tree has borne.
[01:46:44.282 --> 01:46:45.222]  That's the test.
[01:46:45.262 --> 01:46:46.303]  That's how you know.
[01:46:47.443 --> 01:46:49.383]  An evil tree cannot bear good fruit.
[01:46:49.443 --> 01:46:50.904]  They never do.
[01:46:51.484 --> 01:46:52.504]  It's the fruit!
[01:46:52.964 --> 01:46:53.924]  The fruit!
[01:46:55.084 --> 01:46:56.645]  He's defeated legislation.
[01:46:56.885 --> 01:46:58.325]  He's put in good legislation.
[01:46:58.365 --> 01:46:59.325]  He's never stopped.
[01:46:59.345 --> 01:47:00.485]  He's never deviated.
[01:47:01.006 --> 01:47:02.886]  He's always been true and trustworthy.
[01:47:03.524 --> 01:47:05.065]  He's given no indicators.
[01:47:05.506 --> 01:47:06.626]  It's like, how do you trust me?
[01:47:07.027 --> 01:47:07.667]  The fruit!
[01:47:07.987 --> 01:47:08.988]  Look at the fruit!
[01:47:09.389 --> 01:47:10.670]  How much we've defeated together.
[01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:12.031]  How much good we've done.
[01:47:13.031 --> 01:47:14.112]  The victories we've had.
[01:47:15.853 --> 01:47:16.774]  It's the fruit!
[01:47:17.695 --> 01:47:18.756]  The fruit!
[01:47:19.076 --> 01:47:19.676]  I'm gonna say it again.
[01:47:20.037 --> 01:47:21.037]  The fruit!
[01:47:21.338 --> 01:47:22.158]  The fruit!
[01:47:22.459 --> 01:47:23.219]  The fruit!
[01:47:23.519 --> 01:47:24.120]  The fruit!
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:25.461]  How do you judge a tree?
[01:47:25.501 --> 01:47:26.562]  How do you judge a vine?
[01:47:27.422 --> 01:47:29.564]  How do you judge a grapevine?
[01:47:31.258 --> 01:47:32.059]  Is it healthy?
[01:47:32.159 --> 01:47:33.480]  Is it bearing good fruit?
[01:47:35.682 --> 01:47:41.268]  It can have big leaves and big, you know, long tendrils into the ground as vines.
[01:47:42.929 --> 01:47:46.553]  But they'll tell you some of the best grapes come off the old vines.
[01:47:46.573 --> 01:47:48.595]  They've got the little, little leaves.
[01:47:48.615 --> 01:47:50.937]  They don't even look that healthy, but it's got the fruit.
[01:47:51.637 --> 01:47:54.040]  I don't know how I'm supposed to explain this to you.
[01:47:55.117 --> 01:48:02.701]  And I hear people say bad stuff about Ron Paul, and they never give any facts.
[01:48:03.522 --> 01:48:05.043]  I mean, you come in with an accusation.
[01:48:05.083 --> 01:48:05.903]  It was an accusation.
[01:48:06.223 --> 01:48:07.764]  You know, they play us like a fiddle.
[01:48:07.924 --> 01:48:09.305]  I just don't know about Ron Paul.
[01:48:09.745 --> 01:48:10.886]  Give your evidence.
[01:48:11.406 --> 01:48:12.567]  Give your examples.
[01:48:12.627 --> 01:48:14.328]  You do not have them.
[01:48:14.908 --> 01:48:15.488]  Believe me.
[01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:16.449]  I know this man.
[01:48:16.769 --> 01:48:17.470]  I've looked at him.
[01:48:17.530 --> 01:48:18.110]  I've studied him.
[01:48:18.190 --> 01:48:18.890]  I've watched him.
[01:48:20.251 --> 01:48:21.692]  And I trust Ron Paul.
[01:48:23.101 --> 01:48:32.241]  And then there's also, in any fight, you've got to be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove, but at the same time, you've got to have a little trust.
[01:48:33.664 --> 01:48:35.285]  You know what, I could sit here and be paranoid.
[01:48:35.305 --> 01:48:37.347]  People always ask me, well, you must be paranoid about what you do.
[01:48:37.407 --> 01:48:38.247]  No, I'm not paranoid.
[01:48:38.267 --> 01:48:39.588]  I don't worry about my life.
[01:48:39.708 --> 01:48:41.069]  I don't worry about things.
[01:48:41.569 --> 01:48:44.872]  I just put it in God's hands, and I try to have some discernment.
[01:48:44.912 --> 01:48:50.215]  And if people bear bad fruit and do weird things, I give them a lot of rope, and then I get them out of my life.
[01:48:50.575 --> 01:48:51.436]  I get away from them.
[01:48:52.757 --> 01:48:55.699]  But it's all the fruit.
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.342]  And look at how the media is attacking.
[01:48:59.362 --> 01:49:01.665]  Now, the media was going, Ron Paul's great.
[01:49:01.705 --> 01:49:02.646]  Ron Paul's going to win.
[01:49:02.926 --> 01:49:05.248]  Ron Paul's the man to fight the New World Order.
[01:49:05.449 --> 01:49:07.511]  If they suddenly did that, I'd go, whoa.
[01:49:08.472 --> 01:49:15.739]  I still wouldn't distrust Ron Paul because of his fruit, what he's done, his works, his life, who he is, and then my determinant on top of that.
[01:49:16.633 --> 01:49:21.716]  But I would go, they're going to set him up, or they're going to try to discredit the movement through him, or something's coming up.
[01:49:21.736 --> 01:49:22.076]  No, no, no.
[01:49:22.236 --> 01:49:28.840]  The fact that they're censoring him, and attacking him, and doing all this, that's only more of a confirmation.
[01:49:30.381 --> 01:49:30.782]  You see?
[01:49:31.662 --> 01:49:34.564]  And so, I guess I'm just, you're probably a good person, I'm sorry if I was mean to you.
[01:49:34.924 --> 01:49:41.008]  It's just, that lack of discernment, and just the whole tone of it, I recoiled from it.
[01:49:41.888 --> 01:49:44.250]  Plus, I was busy throwing a fit about a guest not being on the show.
[01:49:46.983 --> 01:49:49.346]  We'll be right back to talk more about it and take calls in the third hour.
[01:49:49.366 --> 01:49:59.236]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:59.616 --> 01:50:07.244]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:07.941 --> 01:50:14.984]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:15.404 --> 01:50:26.809]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:27.129 --> 01:50:30.651]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:31.071 --> 01:50:33.032]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:33.352 --> 01:50:37.134]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:51.465 --> 01:51:00.534]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:00.794 --> 01:51:12.024]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:12.364 --> 01:51:17.189]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:51:17.389 --> 01:51:17.549]  I think?
[01:51:36.425 --> 01:51:38.046]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.

[01:51:50.549 --> 01:51:52.269]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:52.489 --> 01:51:56.190]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:56.530 --> 01:51:58.730]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:51:59.250 --> 01:52:05.452]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:05.612 --> 01:52:10.512]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:10.712 --> 01:52:19.654]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:52:20.054 --> 01:52:26.075]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[01:52:44.479 --> 01:52:49.540]  That's Net, the number 7, Tech.com, and start protecting yourself today.
[01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:59.022]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:52:59.642 --> 01:53:02.642]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:12.504 --> 01:53:17.425]  Got the emails pouring in about this, that woman that was on with us from the population control group.
[01:53:18.268 --> 01:53:21.510]  Please tell that dumb woman that we're not overpopulated in the UK.
[01:53:24.032 --> 01:53:27.214]  97% of this country's population live on 3% of the land.
[01:53:27.674 --> 01:53:33.058]  We live in dense populated areas because it suits the knobs to have it that way.
[01:53:33.158 --> 01:53:33.598]  Cheers.
[01:53:37.421 --> 01:53:43.745]  And it, uh, then I got one that, um, that agrees with her.
[01:53:45.988 --> 01:53:55.595]  Boy, you want to go over there when they go grab a second or third baby, especially from the poor, and drown it right in front of the mother in China, and then just stand over it and go, Good!
[01:53:55.995 --> 01:53:57.076]  Good, there you go!
[01:53:57.096 --> 01:53:59.318]  You just saved the Earth!
[01:54:01.079 --> 01:54:04.482]  I'm not saying humans don't cause problems, but we come first.
[01:54:04.862 --> 01:54:09.745]  As soon as you let a government start saying humans are the problem, you're going to get enslaved real fast.
[01:54:10.046 --> 01:54:13.088]  And by the way, governments that do enslaving, like Nazi Germany and
[01:54:13.826 --> 01:54:19.888]  Russia would throw nuclear reactors in their lakes when they were done with them.
[01:54:21.749 --> 01:54:23.070]  Government's the biggest polluter.
[01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:24.730]  You just don't understand.
[01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:30.672]  What we're saying here is, help the third world, don't exterminate them.
[01:54:31.033 --> 01:54:37.055]  I mean, they have been caught putting pathogens to sterilize people and things in the inoculations.
[01:54:37.555 --> 01:54:39.196]  It's wrong to sterilize people.
[01:54:39.696 --> 01:54:40.156]  It's evil.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:46.702]  But once you get that elitist attitude of, you know, it's for the turtles, I like the turtles and the whales, we're going to do it.
[01:54:47.482 --> 01:54:49.683]  Once you do that, that's down the path to hell.
[01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:51.624]  You've got to fix it other ways.
[01:54:52.104 --> 01:54:52.984]  Don't you get me?
[01:54:53.984 --> 01:54:54.465]  Listen to this.
[01:54:54.725 --> 01:54:58.886]  You're making a total fool of yourself on global overpopulation.
[01:54:59.386 --> 01:55:01.587]  Notice the last guy gave statistics, this person doesn't.
[01:55:01.947 --> 01:55:02.907]  It's just all emotional.
[01:55:03.367 --> 01:55:06.188]  You're making a total fool of yourself on global overpopulation.
[01:55:06.649 --> 01:55:07.829]  You are wrong on this one.
[01:55:08.994 --> 01:55:12.800]  The air and water of the planet is being totally destroyed by overpopulation.
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:17.286]  The outdoors you love so much is being destroyed by the toxic effect of overpopulation.
[01:55:17.346 --> 01:55:19.029]  Wake up, Alex, and back off on this one.
[01:55:22.023 --> 01:55:22.904]  I'm not sure.
[01:55:23.504 --> 01:55:24.905]  It's the toxic waste.
[01:55:25.305 --> 01:55:26.586]  It's the genetic engineering.
[01:55:26.926 --> 01:55:31.569]  You notice all she talked about was carbon footprints, carbon dioxide.
[01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:41.716]  They've picked something that doesn't hurt anything as a way to take all your energies away from real environmental action and put it into setting up a global government.
[01:55:41.996 --> 01:55:43.978]  Don't you get anything I tell you?
[01:55:44.762 --> 01:55:46.523]  It's a fact the sun is heating up.
[01:55:46.784 --> 01:55:50.827]  It's a fact the whole solar system and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are melting.
[01:55:51.067 --> 01:55:52.108]  The ice-covered moons.
[01:55:52.428 --> 01:55:56.011]  It is a fact that the ice caps are melting on Mars.
[01:55:57.732 --> 01:55:58.513]  It is a fact.
[01:56:00.834 --> 01:56:04.137]  Can't I... I mean, does any of that ever get across to you?
[01:56:04.157 --> 01:56:11.683]  Alright, when we get back we're going to go to your and the Netherlands and others immediately when we start the next hour.
[01:56:13.234 --> 01:56:14.515]  Back to the Ron Paul thing.
[01:56:14.535 --> 01:56:18.156]  You've got to judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:56:18.536 --> 01:56:20.857]  You've got to look at his past actions.
[01:56:20.877 --> 01:56:26.219]  Then you've got to look at how the media is attacking him, sparingly, and more often just ignoring him.
[01:56:26.259 --> 01:56:30.660]  That's the sure sign that they're really afraid of you.
[01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:32.141]  Ron Paul is the real deal.
[01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:38.952]  And when it presents itself, you've got to throw in with him and give him the support instead of, I don't know, it's too good to be true.
[01:56:38.993 --> 01:56:39.833]  They're invincible.
[01:56:40.373 --> 01:56:41.153]  They're unstoppable.
[01:56:41.173 --> 01:56:42.234]  They are not invincible.
[01:56:42.514 --> 01:56:48.717]  They're slick, they're sophisticated, but once you're aware of their scams, it's pretty easy to beat them if we just take action.
[01:56:48.737 --> 01:56:56.000]  I mean, look, all I do is get emails about how we're going to lose and how they're invincible and how we can't do it and nobody's awake and nobody cares.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.781]  The polls show the opposite.
[01:56:58.081 --> 01:57:00.182]  People I talk to on the street show the opposite.
[01:57:00.885 --> 01:57:05.048]  I couldn't walk down the street in Ottawa, Canada without being stopped every 15th person.
[01:57:05.488 --> 01:57:07.549]  That's a lot of people that know just little me.
[01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:09.370]  I'm just one guy in this fight.
[01:57:11.231 --> 01:57:13.973]  Every three or four people in Austin stop me and say, good job.
[01:57:13.993 --> 01:57:16.515]  And that's where we've really been concentrating our firepower.
[01:57:17.315 --> 01:57:18.476]  But I'm just one indicator.
[01:57:19.617 --> 01:57:20.797]  I'm like an acid test.
[01:57:21.558 --> 01:57:23.559]  And I'm telling you folks, we're winning this fight.
[01:57:23.879 --> 01:57:26.461]  But we gotta first realize we're winning to come in for the big win.
[01:57:26.881 --> 01:57:28.082]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:57:30.618 --> 01:57:35.653]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:46.704 --> 01:57:50.927]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:51.547 --> 01:57:52.348]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:54.069]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:58.312]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.852 --> 01:58:02.995]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:03.936 --> 01:58:12.542]  I'm gonna get more into Ron Paul and why we should believe in him, why should we trust him.
[01:58:14.193 --> 01:58:21.338]  But in a way, that's a destructive process right there because it enters the idea into people's minds and it creates hesitation.
[01:58:22.239 --> 01:58:23.299]  But I guess we have to do that.
[01:58:23.319 --> 01:58:24.520]  I guess it's a good exercise.
[01:58:25.101 --> 01:58:29.864]  I just can't believe there's hesitation, but I can't believe people don't know that mercury's bad for their brains.
[01:58:29.964 --> 01:58:36.609]  I mean, you're, Sullivan, Dawes in the UK, many others, we're going to go to your calls right now.
[01:58:37.378 --> 01:58:38.979]  And there is a lot of other news I'm going to get into.
[01:58:38.999 --> 01:58:40.680]  I also want to talk about population reduction.
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:42.741]  We have some audio clips we're going to play of that.
[01:58:43.482 --> 01:58:44.902]  And really talk about the real numbers.
[01:58:45.823 --> 01:58:48.945]  But right now, let's go to Jaes in the Netherlands.
[01:58:48.985 --> 01:58:49.985]  Been holding patiently.
[01:58:50.386 --> 01:58:51.426]  Jaes, thanks for holding.
[01:58:51.466 --> 01:58:51.807]  Go ahead.
[01:58:52.407 --> 01:58:54.208]  Yes, thanks very much for taking my call.
[01:58:55.108 --> 01:58:58.370]  It was really the arrogance of the woman you just had on.
[01:58:58.811 --> 01:58:59.991]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:59:00.572 --> 01:59:01.292]  Pushing the lie.
[01:59:01.552 --> 01:59:02.493]  Still pushing the lie.
[01:59:03.532 --> 01:59:12.000]  In case anyone still has any doubts about his European royalty and what monsters they actually are, I just want to mention the example of Leopold II of Belgium.
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:13.622]  I don't know if you ever heard of him.
[01:59:15.203 --> 01:59:15.783]  Yes, I have.
[01:59:16.764 --> 01:59:17.665]  Yes, right.
[01:59:18.626 --> 01:59:22.209]  He had a private enterprise, the Congo Free State, he called it.
[01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:28.395]  It was a private project undertaken by the king to extract rubber and ivory in the Congo region of Central Africa.
[01:59:29.099 --> 01:59:35.041]  And which relied on forced labor and resulted in the deaths of between 8 and 30 million Congolese.
[01:59:35.541 --> 01:59:37.562]  I mean, talk about population reduction.
[01:59:38.362 --> 01:59:39.883]  This is what Leopold II did.
[01:59:40.703 --> 01:59:43.864]  Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family.
[01:59:44.805 --> 01:59:52.227]  And I also want to mention another thing about the Royal Dutch Airlines transporting Nazis just after the war to Argentina.
[01:59:53.568 --> 01:59:57.209]  It was posted on Infowars.com just today.
[01:59:58.654 --> 02:00:00.195]  Have you had a chance to read it?
[02:00:01.655 --> 02:00:01.875]  No.
[02:00:01.935 --> 02:00:07.316]  In fact, you have written some great articles for us that we've checked out and have been proven to be very accurate.
[02:00:07.757 --> 02:00:09.777]  In the past, I haven't seen the latest article.
[02:00:10.777 --> 02:00:13.118]  Tell folks your full name and tell us about yourself.
[02:00:13.698 --> 02:00:13.878]  Right.
[02:00:14.238 --> 02:00:15.979]  My name is Jurien Maassen.
[02:00:16.759 --> 02:00:18.099]  It's a little bit difficult.
[02:00:18.139 --> 02:00:18.840]  It's a Dutch name.
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:21.920]  My background is in audiovisual productions.
[02:00:22.701 --> 02:00:27.522]  I've made several low-budget documentaries.
[02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:42.675]  And right now I'm in the process of writing a book with a good friend of mine about Queen Beatrix and her yoke, and especially the people that are now pushing all this new world order.
[02:00:42.715 --> 02:00:44.416]  You know what, I want to give you some more time.
[02:00:44.736 --> 02:00:50.738]  First off right now, spend a few minutes on the new Nazi information, which I'd read about before, but I guess you've got more info.
[02:00:51.058 --> 02:00:53.759]  And then let's get into King Leopold and some of the things he did.
[02:00:54.511 --> 02:00:54.691]  Right.
[02:00:55.351 --> 02:01:09.058]  Well, first of all, the Nazi flights which Royal Dutch Airlines was making, the Dutch Liberal Party and some institutes in the Netherlands have pushed for an investigation of this actually.
[02:01:09.659 --> 02:01:19.584]  There was a television program aired a couple of days ago on Dutch national television exposing that the airlines were fully conscious of the unusual cargo and even put pressure on Swiss Air
[02:01:20.086 --> 02:01:24.369]  The booking agent to transport the Nazis as quickly and quietly as possible.
[02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:32.315]  Now, the interesting thing is that the late Prince Bernard of Orange Nassau was, in fact, behind it.
[02:01:33.356 --> 02:01:37.239]  He was the prominent commissionary at the time the illegal flights took place.
[02:01:38.139 --> 02:01:40.941]  So that warrants a thorough investigation, I think.
[02:01:42.242 --> 02:01:44.224]  So that's the news about that.
[02:01:44.784 --> 02:01:48.387]  So it's still the question if they're going to actually go ahead with the investigation.
[02:01:49.198 --> 02:01:52.201]  So we're going to have to push this within the Netherlands.
[02:01:54.284 --> 02:01:58.568]  And folks, having against Germans, you know, my mom's German on her side of the family.
[02:01:59.129 --> 02:02:00.591]  It's the leadership of Germany.
[02:02:01.051 --> 02:02:04.094]  The Dutch royal family, of course, is German, just like the British.
[02:02:04.775 --> 02:02:04.975]  Right.
[02:02:05.136 --> 02:02:07.158]  It's just, it's just, it's German.
[02:02:07.757 --> 02:02:09.118]  And they've always been German.
[02:02:09.158 --> 02:02:12.900]  They spoke German until like a century ago in The Hague.
[02:02:13.361 --> 02:02:15.082]  They just spoke German amongst each other.
[02:02:15.122 --> 02:02:16.663]  So they are just German.
[02:02:17.063 --> 02:02:19.665]  And so are their relatives in Belgium.
[02:02:19.985 --> 02:02:22.007]  Well, that's where Prince Philip is German.
[02:02:22.047 --> 02:02:26.490]  He was an SS officer in the Fuhrer's personal corps.
[02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:34.455]  And then when he decided the Fuhrer would probably lose, he scurried over to England and then did some stage stuff in a
[02:02:35.956 --> 02:02:37.817]  Spitfire, he's so disgusting.
[02:02:38.597 --> 02:02:41.778]  Stay there, stay there you're... I'll come right back to you.
[02:02:42.999 --> 02:02:50.922]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:51.282 --> 02:02:58.865]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:59.631 --> 02:03:06.674]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:07.074 --> 02:03:18.499]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:18.819 --> 02:03:22.301]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:22.761 --> 02:03:24.702]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:25.042 --> 02:03:28.884]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:36.329 --> 02:04:45.851]  803-4438 or order on the web at Berkeywater.com I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[02:04:46.311 --> 02:04:48.992]  But every time I get a pedicure my feet look great.
[02:04:49.752 --> 02:04:50.892]  For a while anyway.
[02:04:51.392 --> 02:04:54.573]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[02:04:55.173 --> 02:04:57.494]  Listen, haven't you heard about Cal-X ointment?
[02:04:57.814 --> 02:05:01.314]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:05:01.674 --> 02:05:03.835]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:05:04.492 --> 02:05:05.193]  What's the name again?
[02:05:05.213 --> 02:05:06.574]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:05:06.974 --> 02:05:07.795]  It's Calex.
[02:05:08.195 --> 02:05:09.837]  C-A-L-E-X.
[02:05:10.658 --> 02:05:12.339]  What makes Calex ointment so different?
[02:05:12.539 --> 02:05:20.827]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:05:21.886 --> 02:05:26.448]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[02:05:26.668 --> 02:05:35.773]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, HEB Grocery Stores, Medicine Shop Pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:05:36.493 --> 02:05:37.594]  Hey, there's a drug store.
[02:05:37.634 --> 02:05:38.294]  I'll be right back.
[02:05:38.554 --> 02:05:39.555]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[02:05:42.516 --> 02:05:44.717]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:45.278 --> 02:05:48.059]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.206 --> 02:06:04.867]  Juror has written a lot of great articles for us and a few of them he sent us we somehow missed.
[02:06:04.887 --> 02:06:09.188]  We're going to post those today at JonesReport.com in the next hour.
[02:06:10.169 --> 02:06:12.089]  And Juror just does amazing research.
[02:06:12.129 --> 02:06:14.770]  He, of course, is Dutch.
[02:06:16.630 --> 02:06:22.052]  I get criticized for talking about how a German weird death cult runs things.
[02:06:22.794 --> 02:06:24.315]  And they are intermarried with the Rothschilds.
[02:06:24.355 --> 02:06:26.177]  That's certainly real and true as well.
[02:06:26.777 --> 02:06:30.300]  But from real history that I've studied, they've been very careful to keep quiet.
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.381]  The Czars were German.
[02:06:33.242 --> 02:06:34.903]  The royalty of Germany was German.
[02:06:34.943 --> 02:06:36.164]  The Dutch royalty is German.
[02:06:36.584 --> 02:06:39.106]  The French royalty was Austrian and German.
[02:06:40.305 --> 02:06:45.389]  The British Royalty is German, and the Greek Royalty is German.
[02:06:45.770 --> 02:06:47.611]  I mean, they're all German.
[02:06:47.732 --> 02:06:55.819]  And then, the Bushes are related to them, Blair's related to them, just everybody!
[02:06:55.919 --> 02:06:57.441]  It's one group!
[02:06:58.041 --> 02:07:01.865]  And yes, they've intermarried with some Jewish folks.
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:19.028]  And people say, no, it's the Catholics, it's the Jews, it's the... I'm telling you folks, I know who owns the banks, and I know who owns the armament companies, and I know who owns... I mean, folks, literally, Rothschilds fall down on their knees before the Queen of England, and it's not because she's got a crown on.
[02:07:19.128 --> 02:07:21.990]  That lady, that's why I called her so many names yesterday.
[02:07:22.530 --> 02:07:24.331]  I never call women uncouth names.
[02:07:24.831 --> 02:07:26.232]  You know, the name for a female dog.
[02:07:26.872 --> 02:07:30.554]  I never call... I never talk... I don't use language.
[02:07:31.761 --> 02:07:34.765]  I do that because it's all about worshipping her.
[02:07:35.165 --> 02:07:36.627]  It's all about how she's God.
[02:07:36.667 --> 02:07:38.929]  It's all about how our presidents bow to her.
[02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:42.894]  And our secretaries of state become knights of the garter.
[02:07:44.275 --> 02:07:48.580]  It's important that we basically defile them.
[02:07:49.181 --> 02:07:51.163]  And by that I mean that we defy them.
[02:07:51.858 --> 02:07:53.458]  It is important that we let them know.
[02:07:53.498 --> 02:07:55.159]  I mean, I don't want to be uncouth here.
[02:07:55.279 --> 02:07:56.839]  I have never been into potty humor.
[02:07:57.259 --> 02:07:58.359]  I've never been gross.
[02:07:58.419 --> 02:08:00.820]  I've never been into saying, you know, juvenile.
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:04.861]  But, I mean, maybe we should call, going number two, a Queen Elizabeth.
[02:08:05.441 --> 02:08:11.202]  You know, I mean, and introduce that to the culture and to everyone because she's evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:11.502 --> 02:08:12.162]  She's bad.
[02:08:12.202 --> 02:08:12.902]  She's killed.
[02:08:13.282 --> 02:08:16.663]  The people that represent her have killed millions and millions of people.
[02:08:17.523 --> 02:08:20.664]  And so, you know, maybe we should call Port-A-Potties Queen Elizabeths.
[02:08:21.471 --> 02:08:25.313]  And if your dog vomits on the carpet, oh, he went Queen Elizabeth.
[02:08:25.993 --> 02:08:27.094]  Because it's important.
[02:08:27.414 --> 02:08:35.418]  These have killed millions of people, and they got everyone trained about how to respond to them and do dog tricks for them when they're so evil.
[02:08:36.338 --> 02:08:37.339]  And so there, I've done it.
[02:08:37.399 --> 02:08:44.242]  I made a joke around the office last night at about 1am when I was sitting there watching video of her, just so disgusted by everyone cowering.
[02:08:44.642 --> 02:08:48.164]  I watched hours of everyone coming in and groveling and kneeling before her.
[02:08:49.508 --> 02:08:51.989]  And folks, I just can't handle it.
[02:08:52.830 --> 02:09:00.594]  And how they went into the Dutch people, incredibly intelligent, filled with ingenuity and just sciences, and it just sucked off of them.
[02:09:00.934 --> 02:09:03.055]  They didn't get control until 1845.
[02:09:03.895 --> 02:09:05.196]  It was just a private family.
[02:09:05.236 --> 02:09:15.161]  They just moved in, got so wealthy, they just called themselves kings, and then brought over a royal princeling to marry it to their daughter, and that's where you got the House of Orange.
[02:09:16.468 --> 02:09:22.530]  And yes, I knew about Leopold, and history books say over 10 million, but a lot of the numbers could be over 30 million.
[02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:31.912]  And I mean, they literally, folks, killing tens of millions of Africans, using them as slave labor until they died, that's evil!
[02:09:32.593 --> 02:09:36.114]  And so the least we can do is call anything foul a Queen Elizabeth.
[02:09:37.074 --> 02:09:38.654]  I mean, you sneezed all over yourself?
[02:09:38.774 --> 02:09:40.735]  Oh, I Queen Elizabeth'd.
[02:09:40.855 --> 02:09:43.256]  You accidentally passed gas in a room?
[02:09:43.296 --> 02:09:44.536]  I'm sorry, I Queen Elizabeth'd.
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:47.921]  In fact, I'm not going to be mean to the French anymore.
[02:09:47.981 --> 02:09:54.162]  That's an Anglo, Boorish thing that we've been taught.
[02:09:54.562 --> 02:09:59.503]  That's an Imperial thing to call, you know, oh excuse my French when you use profanity.
[02:09:59.884 --> 02:10:02.364]  You see, that's another thing out of this same crowd.
[02:10:02.644 --> 02:10:03.785]  We're not going to do that anymore.
[02:10:04.125 --> 02:10:05.365]  I'm going to stop using that term.
[02:10:05.985 --> 02:10:13.592]  When I use a mild profanity, which I will not do on air, I'm sorry, but the point is, I will now call it a Queen Elizabeth.
[02:10:14.032 --> 02:10:15.814]  Anything vile is a Queen Elizabeth.
[02:10:16.234 --> 02:10:19.517]  And if Prince Charles becomes king, anything vile will be a King Charles.
[02:10:19.937 --> 02:10:23.140]  I'm asking you to use this and coin this now.
[02:10:24.141 --> 02:10:24.522]  Okay?
[02:10:26.443 --> 02:10:32.909]  I know it takes being crude around the office, but just say, I've got to go, my stomach's been hurting, I've had a serious Queen Elizabeth.
[02:10:33.496 --> 02:10:34.597]  Okay, I've done it.
[02:10:34.877 --> 02:10:35.637]  I said I'd do it.
[02:10:35.737 --> 02:10:36.177]  I've done it.
[02:10:36.938 --> 02:10:38.698]  And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:38.979 --> 02:10:39.919]  Because it's important.
[02:10:40.579 --> 02:10:47.022]  I mean, you've got some criminal in a suit made of diamonds with a crown with our president and others bowing down to her.
[02:10:48.623 --> 02:10:48.843]  Why?
[02:10:48.883 --> 02:10:52.865]  Because she's a long line of hereditary murderers and scum.
[02:10:52.885 --> 02:10:59.128]  You know, I said I wouldn't get into this, but let's go back to your... Please tell us about the murder of the Africans.
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:01.821]  Right, and it's a sad history.
[02:11:02.001 --> 02:11:08.084]  I mean, indeed, it was about 30 million people actually, you should say killed.
[02:11:08.224 --> 02:11:11.126]  I mean, they were killed actually by the Belgian king.
[02:11:11.886 --> 02:11:20.951]  Also, he ordered, he himself ordered people's hands cut off if they didn't provide enough rubber or ivory, the clothing they should make every day.
[02:11:20.971 --> 02:11:21.972]  That's what they did?
[02:11:22.012 --> 02:11:24.993]  Well, I mean, now they show the Africans and go, look at these animals.
[02:11:25.354 --> 02:11:26.454]  They cut the hands off.
[02:11:26.474 --> 02:11:27.635]  They learned that from him.
[02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:29.214]  Right, right.
[02:11:29.535 --> 02:11:30.877]  I mean, he's been there for centuries.
[02:11:30.977 --> 02:11:34.804]  I mean, where else should they pick that up, you know?
[02:11:36.347 --> 02:11:42.337]  For a large part, it's European royalty actually initiating all of that, all of the trouble they're in now.
[02:11:43.231 --> 02:11:44.712]  And the trouble we're in now.
[02:11:44.932 --> 02:11:47.074]  I mean, it's just killing everybody.
[02:11:47.274 --> 02:11:48.215]  I know, I know.
[02:11:48.315 --> 02:11:50.176]  And of course, they're all related.
[02:11:50.216 --> 02:11:52.058]  Queen Elizabeth's closely related to him.
[02:11:52.598 --> 02:11:53.459]  It's the same people.
[02:11:53.519 --> 02:11:56.781]  That's why I detest her.
[02:11:56.842 --> 02:12:06.849]  I mean, what is it like to see that royalty walk around, everybody bow down and worship them, and their finances are secret, and Leopold's a Nazi.
[02:12:06.909 --> 02:12:08.651]  I mean, Prince Bernard was a Nazi.
[02:12:09.351 --> 02:12:10.332]  I'm so sick of them.
[02:12:11.044 --> 02:12:11.605]  It's too much.
[02:12:11.705 --> 02:12:20.552]  I mean, if you see it on television, especially that attitude that, you know, completely dumbed down, which, you know, really gets my blood going.
[02:12:20.652 --> 02:12:25.456]  And that's why I'm writing the articles and especially the book, which we're writing now.
[02:12:25.556 --> 02:12:28.778]  So, I mean, it is motivating to see all that.
[02:12:29.319 --> 02:12:33.062]  Are you going to name the bathrooms in the Netherlands Queen Beatrix's?
[02:12:34.243 --> 02:12:34.423]  Right.
[02:12:34.563 --> 02:12:36.845]  The bathrooms are Queen Beatrix's right now.
[02:12:37.733 --> 02:12:46.227]  Um, so, and everything that's vile and bad about the Earth, about people, and wanting to reduce population, especially.
[02:12:46.247 --> 02:12:49.934]  I mean, Queen Elizabeth, you know, just like you said.
[02:12:51.235 --> 02:12:53.237]  Well, and again, I never talk like that.
[02:12:53.257 --> 02:12:54.498]  I'm doing it for a reason.
[02:12:54.538 --> 02:13:08.568]  They claim, on the back of the movie DVD about the Queen that we've got for research purposes, it says, unfathomable dignity, uncredible grace, she's almost not human.
[02:13:08.588 --> 02:13:11.411]  I mean, give me a break, man!
[02:13:11.431 --> 02:13:14.293]  I mean, these are mass murdering scum!
[02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:21.235]  These are hereditary serial killer families, and the least we can do is associate them with anything vile.
[02:13:21.515 --> 02:13:24.137]  You see a dead dog with maggots all over the side of the road?
[02:13:24.678 --> 02:13:25.859]  Oh, look at that Queen Elizabeth!
[02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:28.481]  I mean, do you see the point I'm trying to make here?
[02:13:28.501 --> 02:13:30.143]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:30.163 --> 02:13:31.184]  That fits the description.
[02:13:31.244 --> 02:13:36.149]  I mean, you know, a carcass alive with maggots.
[02:13:36.649 --> 02:13:37.770]  I mean, that's about it.
[02:13:40.296 --> 02:13:41.117]  Yeah, it's a symbol.
[02:13:41.537 --> 02:13:47.222]  Yeah, I mean, I want the world to know, because, you know, these black groups and others think that we're all evil because of these leaders.
[02:13:47.823 --> 02:13:50.405]  No, if your leaders would have gotten control, they would act like this, too.
[02:13:50.425 --> 02:13:52.827]  This is what evil people in power do.
[02:13:53.668 --> 02:13:55.490]  And we, not in our name.
[02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:57.972]  I mean, look, that Queen of England is not in my name.
[02:13:58.272 --> 02:13:59.934]  George Bush is not done in my name.
[02:14:01.575 --> 02:14:03.817]  What Queen Beatrice does is not in yours name.
[02:14:03.837 --> 02:14:05.579]  And that's why you're doing what he's doing.
[02:14:05.639 --> 02:14:06.620]  It's not in our name.
[02:14:07.426 --> 02:14:07.626]  Right.
[02:14:07.886 --> 02:14:15.070]  It's not in our name, and it's never in our name, because they have had this power already for centuries, so how could it be in our name?
[02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:20.552]  And by the way, they want to do the same stuff they've done to Africa and Asia to us.
[02:14:21.112 --> 02:14:22.733]  That's why we've got to beat them, folks.
[02:14:23.273 --> 02:14:23.493]  Right.
[02:14:23.533 --> 02:14:25.094]  But they're more subtle with us, you know?
[02:14:25.134 --> 02:14:26.455]  They're more subtle.
[02:14:26.755 --> 02:14:28.035]  In Africa, they just go wild.
[02:14:28.816 --> 02:14:32.157]  And with us, they know we have an educated population.
[02:14:32.357 --> 02:14:33.098]  It's the guns.
[02:14:33.258 --> 02:14:34.658]  It's the guns, yeah.
[02:14:35.319 --> 02:14:35.459]  Yeah.
[02:14:36.877 --> 02:14:41.398]  I mean, take the Dutch, where everybody was armed.
[02:14:41.898 --> 02:14:49.420]  In fact, the Swiss really got that from the Dutch, where every neighborhood had its own little private army to protect from invasion, to protect the dykes.
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:53.481]  And then that's why you guys never really have had any military problems.
[02:14:53.761 --> 02:14:55.201]  And you were a free society.
[02:14:55.441 --> 02:15:00.042]  That's why the Pilgrims tried to go there first, and to Holland and other areas.
[02:15:00.502 --> 02:15:08.167]  And so, and you've had a great history, so you've had great developments, and now you've got parasites ruling over you, and all of that's being reversed!
[02:15:08.547 --> 02:15:09.668]  This is not in our name!
[02:15:10.489 --> 02:15:18.234]  Right, and the period you talk about, when we were actually free, that was the only time where we didn't have one of the family Orans sitting in power.
[02:15:19.275 --> 02:15:19.895]  The only time.
[02:15:20.095 --> 02:15:24.438]  All the other times they were, you know, in key places of power.
[02:15:25.238 --> 02:15:28.020]  And every man, every household had guns.
[02:15:29.928 --> 02:15:31.510]  And boy, now that isn't the case, is it?
[02:15:31.530 --> 02:15:34.453]  Oh, it's not the case at all.
[02:15:34.854 --> 02:15:38.337]  I mean, it's actually illegal in the Netherlands to have guns.
[02:15:38.718 --> 02:15:39.218]  It's illegal.
[02:15:40.099 --> 02:15:46.106]  But they can have all their trained monkey troops bowing to the Queen, stomping around, staring at the crowd.
[02:15:46.826 --> 02:15:48.328]  I mean, how do we put up with this?
[02:15:49.009 --> 02:15:50.090]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[02:15:51.485 --> 02:15:59.710]  I mean, they give you false choices like Europe, you know, we can carry guns if we join the NATO forces and go fighting somewhere, some bogus war, you know?
[02:15:59.950 --> 02:16:02.212]  That's the only place we can carry guns.
[02:16:03.479 --> 02:16:10.001]  Well, you need to bring back Dutch history and Dutch culture and show the people how they've been... And, of course, what do these people do?
[02:16:10.041 --> 02:16:22.164]  They also flood the European nations, the indigenous lands of the Europeans, with the foreigners, and then try to liberalize and accentuate their hate of the country to further undermine the nation.
[02:16:23.225 --> 02:16:23.425]  Right.
[02:16:23.505 --> 02:16:24.385]  It's all games, you know?
[02:16:24.485 --> 02:16:27.006]  They import them, and then they, you know...
[02:16:27.788 --> 02:16:31.190]  Enforce the elements that want to get rid of them.
[02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:35.032]  I think the problem is only the illegals and not the people setting that up, yeah.
[02:16:35.492 --> 02:16:39.534]  And then they pose as the saviors over the illegals, or the people they brought in.
[02:16:40.154 --> 02:16:40.354]  Right.
[02:16:41.315 --> 02:16:45.457]  Oh, it's absolutely... Very divide and conquer, exactly.
[02:16:45.697 --> 02:16:48.418]  Godblood, anything else you want to add?
[02:16:48.458 --> 02:16:49.059]  No, that's about it.
[02:16:49.299 --> 02:16:49.779]  Thanks very much.
[02:16:49.919 --> 02:16:57.223]  Is there any website or anything where your stuff is set that we can, or like, any way for anybody in Dutch to see the films you've made?
[02:16:58.071 --> 02:17:03.274]  Not yet, and we wait until the book is finished, then we put up a website.
[02:17:03.454 --> 02:17:12.339]  Well, I tell you, if the book's in English, I'll probably want to carry it, and I'm sorry that my office has had trouble getting back in contact with you, but send that stuff to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:17:12.619 --> 02:17:14.900]  It'll be up on Jones Report within an hour, okay?
[02:17:15.180 --> 02:17:16.081]  Most definitely, I will.
[02:17:16.181 --> 02:17:16.461]  Thank you.
[02:17:16.681 --> 02:17:17.301]  God bless you.
[02:17:17.321 --> 02:17:20.283]  You're an absolutely fabulous individual.
[02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:28.215]  I just found out that somebody in his office earlier told him not to send this stuff a few months ago.
[02:17:28.255 --> 02:17:30.619]  That let my blood pressure go up a little bit.
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:37.169]  But great articles and a translation he's done for us is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:17:38.091 --> 02:17:39.373]  We'll be back with more of your calls.
[02:17:42.634 --> 02:17:43.395]  Terrorism!
[02:17:43.555 --> 02:17:44.295]  Terrorism!

[02:17:50.719 --> 02:17:52.320]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:55.042]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:17:55.422 --> 02:18:09.991]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:20:39.533 --> 02:20:47.038]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:20:47.358 --> 02:20:49.240]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:52.482]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:20:52.662 --> 02:20:55.804]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:20:56.105 --> 02:20:57.946]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:20:58.206 --> 02:21:01.907]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:21:02.187 --> 02:21:04.847]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[02:21:05.468 --> 02:21:09.728]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:21:09.968 --> 02:21:14.269]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:21:14.669 --> 02:21:18.990]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the unholy alliance.

[02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:34.321]  And ask for Packet B.
[02:21:59.095 --> 02:22:04.197]  Oh yeah!
[02:22:04.577 --> 02:22:07.898]  My good friend Jimmy Vaughn.
[02:22:10.319 --> 02:22:10.959]  Welcome back.
[02:22:11.799 --> 02:22:14.560]  Alright, I know we got a bunch of callers here.
[02:22:16.801 --> 02:22:20.802]  Let's go to a call in England first, then we'll go to the one in British Columbia.
[02:22:23.703 --> 02:22:25.463]  Is it Dawes in England?
[02:22:27.805 --> 02:22:28.465]  Go ahead, you're on air.
[02:22:28.565 --> 02:22:29.106]  Thanks for holding.
[02:22:30.126 --> 02:22:31.387]  Well, Alex, this is Daz.
[02:22:32.027 --> 02:22:32.387]  Welcome.
[02:22:33.448 --> 02:22:39.171]  I just want to tell you that you really took it to that lady earlier on with the Prince Philip comment.
[02:22:40.432 --> 02:22:42.072]  Did you hear her freak out and hang up?
[02:22:43.033 --> 02:22:52.618]  Yeah, I mean, if she's going to make a statement such as cutting down the world's population, she needs to put forward her case without hanging up.
[02:22:52.658 --> 02:22:53.418]  I mean, it's cowardice.
[02:22:55.559 --> 02:22:56.660]  Why do you think she hung up?
[02:22:59.327 --> 02:23:09.570]  I mean, I don't think she really knew how much you actually know about the global agenda.
[02:23:12.890 --> 02:23:18.872]  Well, I think it shows that she's pretty sneaky, because when I said that, did you hear her gasp?
[02:23:19.172 --> 02:23:23.893]  Because I don't think they like the fact, I guarantee you Phillip's probably involved with that group.
[02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:32.766]  I mean, I know he gives heavily to a bunch of different population control groups, and I've seen his name associated with it, and I guess they just usually want to discuss his lordship.
[02:23:33.146 --> 02:23:38.890]  Oh, how dare me, a common scum, even mention the name of his grace, hmm?
[02:23:41.973 --> 02:23:42.793]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:23:42.813 --> 02:23:44.074]  What do you think of the Queen over there?
[02:23:48.818 --> 02:23:50.339]  He was on Skype Internet phone, wasn't he?
[02:23:50.359 --> 02:23:51.360]  It sounds like it was breaking up.
[02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:52.761]  He's gone, right?
[02:23:55.285 --> 02:23:56.787]  Yeah, yeah, I think his phone broke up there.
[02:23:56.807 --> 02:23:58.849]  Uh, who's up next here?
[02:24:03.054 --> 02:24:04.535]  Sullivan or Sullivan in B.C.?
[02:24:04.555 --> 02:24:05.496]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:24:07.458 --> 02:24:08.259]  Yeah, yeah, hi there.
[02:24:08.660 --> 02:24:09.320]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:24:10.001 --> 02:24:10.922]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:24:11.202 --> 02:24:12.844]  Thanks for taking my phone call.
[02:24:12.864 --> 02:24:15.107]  The reason I'm calling is I just recently
[02:24:17.091 --> 02:24:24.004]  Showing the light through your documentaries and watched your Terror Storm, America Destroyed by Design, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:24:24.024 --> 02:24:27.551]  I could go on but I just want to make it short because I know we're running out of time.
[02:24:28.628 --> 02:24:53.733]  Two days ago I witnessed with my own eyes two huge chemtrails right over the Eskimo Lagoon just upwind from Victoria, BC and a war veteran pulled up beside me with obviously the war vet plane which is how I knew he was a war vet so I went over to talk to him and he pointed out to me that yes that was a military plane because of how it made the loop and I would estimate the loop was about a mile wide by five miles long.
[02:24:54.253 --> 02:24:57.554]  He went all the way to the other end of it and started again and doubled it up.
[02:24:58.151 --> 02:24:59.972]  And then you could see where the spray stopped.
[02:24:59.992 --> 02:25:02.154]  There was a dash, like a blank.
[02:25:02.615 --> 02:25:05.197]  And it started again, and it stopped, and then the jet was gone.
[02:25:05.957 --> 02:25:07.979]  What was his altitude?
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:13.183]  He must have been about 3,000 to 5,000 feet.
[02:25:14.744 --> 02:25:23.051]  And then there was another one, a huge jet with like four engines that came across in a straight line from the USA coming north.
[02:25:24.012 --> 02:25:26.814]  People were telling me they were leaving from Whitby Island.
[02:25:27.592 --> 02:25:34.355]  And this other jet came past below these two loops that moved, of course, above Victoria after a matter of about two or three hours.
[02:25:34.375 --> 02:25:36.136]  So I stayed there and watched the whole thing.
[02:25:36.156 --> 02:25:44.901]  And then this other huge jet that came under the loop in a straight line, you can see the loop was broken up by the jet stream of the jet passing below it.
[02:25:44.981 --> 02:25:46.101]  It left a dark line.
[02:25:46.561 --> 02:25:47.402]  It broke it open.
[02:25:53.663 --> 02:26:08.230]  Well, I mean, listen, there are tens of thousands of declassified cases of our government, the British government, the Canadian government, other governments, releasing chemical, biological, and radiological materials over cities and towns and rural areas.
[02:26:09.292 --> 02:26:11.153]  I mean, it's just mountains of it.
[02:26:11.193 --> 02:26:17.216]  The general public is still unaware of that, though there have been some PBS whitewashes and a few Discovery Channel and History Channel programs.
[02:26:17.956 --> 02:26:23.679]  And so, and we know that condensation trails didn't stay up for more than a few minutes until 1996.
[02:26:24.599 --> 02:26:26.260]  Now high trails stay up longer.
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:30.302]  Now there's trails forming at a thousand feet where they never formed in hot weather.
[02:26:30.342 --> 02:26:31.762]  I mean, I'm seeing craziness.
[02:26:32.363 --> 02:26:35.184]  There are so many different programs, weather modification.
[02:26:35.984 --> 02:26:37.405]  There was a barren waste odor.
[02:26:38.084 --> 02:26:39.546]  Yeah, so I've been really researching this.
[02:26:39.566 --> 02:26:42.929]  Actually it all started with me looking on Google Earth.
[02:26:53.837 --> 02:26:55.818]  I came across this, the pentagram.
[02:26:55.858 --> 02:26:58.199]  I decided to zoom in on the White House for something to do.
[02:26:58.239 --> 02:26:59.839]  I had no idea what I was going to see.
[02:27:00.299 --> 02:27:03.521]  And I seen the pentagram with my own eyes, and I was like, wow, my God.
[02:27:04.201 --> 02:27:09.083]  Then I looked into it, and there's a Jewish Kabbalah to the west, where the Statue of Lincoln is.
[02:27:09.463 --> 02:27:11.324]  To the right, there's the Freemason's logo.
[02:27:11.844 --> 02:27:17.986]  Then I got into the Freemasonry looking, and then Google is actually Freemasonic, all colors, you know.
[02:27:18.026 --> 02:27:19.967]  And the red is on the right, for the rising sun.
[02:27:21.098 --> 02:27:22.320]  Same as Windows XP.
[02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:23.841]  The XP is red and on the right.
[02:27:24.102 --> 02:27:24.943]  We're out of time.
[02:27:24.983 --> 02:27:25.604]  We're out of time.
[02:27:25.624 --> 02:27:26.485]  We're going to be right back.
[02:27:26.525 --> 02:27:27.566]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:27:27.586 --> 02:27:29.428]  I'm going to cover a bunch of news and take more calls.
[02:27:29.448 --> 02:27:29.849]  Stay with us.
[02:27:32.933 --> 02:27:33.834]  We're on the march.
[02:27:34.314 --> 02:27:35.936]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:36.857 --> 02:27:39.541]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.731 --> 02:27:43.552]  Attention gardeners!
[02:27:43.632 --> 02:27:45.995]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:27:46.216 --> 02:27:50.561]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[02:27:50.762 --> 02:27:58.632]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:27:58.952 --> 02:28:01.773]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:09.595]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:28:09.695 --> 02:28:15.296]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:28:15.516 --> 02:28:21.077]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:28:21.357 --> 02:28:24.678]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:28:24.918 --> 02:28:28.239]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:28:28.499 --> 02:28:33.546]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dervsheave Superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:28:33.566 --> 02:28:36.370]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:28:36.390 --> 02:28:36.650]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:28:42.455 --> 02:28:46.937]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[02:28:47.398 --> 02:28:50.539]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:58.744]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[02:29:00.024 --> 02:29:06.610]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[02:29:07.051 --> 02:29:10.794]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[02:29:11.254 --> 02:29:16.079]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[02:29:16.499 --> 02:29:23.045]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[02:29:23.686 --> 02:29:25.268]  And it's so easy to use.
[02:29:25.768 --> 02:29:31.716]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill up and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.
[02:29:32.136 --> 02:29:38.525]  So, do yourself and the environment a favor and visit ctsavegas.com to get your bottle today.
[02:29:38.825 --> 02:29:41.348]  That's ctsavegas.com.
[02:29:42.089 --> 02:29:45.231]  Do you know the secret to reading 1000% faster?
[02:29:45.652 --> 02:29:46.232]  That's right!
[02:29:46.452 --> 02:29:50.935]  The secret that could allow you to read 10 books in the time it takes others to read one.

[02:30:31.886 --> 02:30:31.946]  1-800-771-8424.
[02:30:32.066 --> 02:30:33.287]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:30:33.307 --> 02:30:34.449]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:57.907 --> 02:31:22.695]  I'm going to go to Mike in England who I'm told disagrees with me about something so he goes ahead of the line and then Michael, Richard and many others that are patiently holding but we're going to just talk to Roger and Mike first because they disagree and then I'm going to
[02:31:23.559 --> 02:31:27.042]  Play some clips of Queen worship off of the news.
[02:31:28.384 --> 02:31:32.007]  Well, this is off of C-SPAN where you hear Colin Powell.
[02:31:32.027 --> 02:31:33.088]  You've got to see the video.
[02:31:33.128 --> 02:31:35.250]  We're going to post it up on JonesReport.com.
[02:31:36.011 --> 02:31:37.873]  Literally in a worship fest.
[02:31:38.414 --> 02:31:39.775]  Just, I mean, all of them.
[02:31:39.795 --> 02:31:41.456]  You'd think they'd died and gone to heaven.
[02:31:42.297 --> 02:31:43.879]  It sounds like complete torture to me.
[02:31:43.919 --> 02:31:45.821]  Going in a room with some mass murderer.
[02:31:46.933 --> 02:31:54.359]  Uh, with some serial killer who wears a, a, a dress of diamonds, uh, with a crown on, bugging her eyes out at everyone.
[02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.941]  I mean, that sounds like hell to me.
[02:31:58.803 --> 02:32:00.044]  Makes my stomach hurt.
[02:32:00.064 --> 02:32:03.006]  Never mind, I'm not gonna do it.
[02:32:03.567 --> 02:32:05.188]  It's just so out of control, folks.
[02:32:05.328 --> 02:32:08.511]  Uh, let's go ahead and go to Mike in England.
[02:32:08.571 --> 02:32:09.431]  Mike, go ahead, sir.
[02:32:09.452 --> 02:32:11.073]  Uh, hi, Alex.
[02:32:11.273 --> 02:32:15.516]  I, uh, I just finished watching Terror Storm, and I was wondering if I could quote something back to you.
[02:32:15.917 --> 02:32:16.057]  Sure.
[02:32:16.721 --> 02:32:17.462]  I disagree.
[02:32:17.782 --> 02:32:20.083]  You said about 7-7 in London.
[02:32:20.504 --> 02:32:25.287]  In the weeks leading up to 7-7, Tony Burr's poll numbers have performed to their lowest point in the seven-year administration.
[02:32:25.647 --> 02:32:28.049]  His Labour Party was sure to lose at parliamentary elections.
[02:32:28.069 --> 02:32:30.711]  Support for the war is difficult despite the bombing.
[02:32:31.251 --> 02:32:33.813]  We should approve his pool ratings and put support for the war.
[02:32:34.133 --> 02:32:38.196]  He was still only fairly able to maintain control over the British House of Commons.
[02:32:39.137 --> 02:32:41.899]  Yes, a big government think tank wrote a
[02:32:43.377 --> 02:32:48.943]  Uh, wrote an attack on that six months ago, and uh, let me put you on hold and comment on that.
[02:32:48.983 --> 02:32:53.207]  In fact, I meant to plug that today, and I haven't even plugged it because of this.
[02:32:54.588 --> 02:32:57.491]  There are two things you could call a mistake in TerrorStorm.
[02:32:58.732 --> 02:33:02.616]  One, because the paper said that he bought a paper.
[02:33:04.108 --> 02:33:10.531]  And then I just said he bought a Metro paper, because that's the paper, and that's a free paper.
[02:33:10.911 --> 02:33:15.152]  The point is the paper says that one of the supposed bombers went and bought a paper.
[02:33:15.893 --> 02:33:17.433]  Well, I said bought a Metro paper.
[02:33:17.493 --> 02:33:18.994]  That's a mistake, that's been changed.
[02:33:19.314 --> 02:33:20.995]  I got a second edition Terrastorm coming out.
[02:33:21.535 --> 02:33:26.237]  Now, in the past, I would write notes and then voice live.
[02:33:26.677 --> 02:33:29.538]  This time, with the in-game, I wrote the whole thing.
[02:33:30.510 --> 02:33:33.974]  And I'm not a big writer, it took me months and I vetted each line and everything.
[02:33:34.495 --> 02:33:37.479]  Tony Blair was in danger of losing the Parliament.
[02:33:38.577 --> 02:33:46.879]  And then they had the election, the bombing happened, they were talking about him stepping down then, and that did boost him and did boost support of the war.
[02:33:47.179 --> 02:33:59.062]  You know how your parliament works, sir, that even if there hasn't been an election, if there's a no-confidence vote, he can be forced to step down, which supposedly he announced today he's going to be doing that.
[02:33:59.442 --> 02:34:02.883]  John Badmountain, the Queen and everything, people might take that personally about England,
[02:34:03.673 --> 02:34:15.137]  And then, you know, the government, through one of its universities, put out a thing attacking TerrorStorm, and they found that, and the other thing, which I'd already found, but not even clearly.
[02:34:15.177 --> 02:34:25.380]  Now, I could play semantical games with you, and say that it's not clear there, because I say, despite the bombings, he still was able to maintain control.
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:26.800]  Okay?
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:30.021]  And literally, when I read that, that's what I meant.
[02:34:30.201 --> 02:34:32.582]  I knew the elections were a couple months before.
[02:34:33.547 --> 02:34:41.518]  Okay, and I'm saying, with the Parliament, he still, you know, they had the election, he was barely able to maintain control, he was still able to stay in position.
[02:34:41.778 --> 02:34:46.785]  That's what Michael Meacher talked about in our interview with him, he'd been in the Blair Cabinet as the Environment Minister.
[02:34:48.138 --> 02:34:51.501]  Is he had talked about how the bombings had helped Blair stay in power.
[02:34:51.601 --> 02:34:52.421]  That was my point.
[02:34:53.382 --> 02:34:55.223]  But let's just say I'm wrong about that.
[02:34:55.664 --> 02:34:59.326]  I mean, let's just say I meant and got the election wrong by a month and a half.
[02:34:59.526 --> 02:35:02.749]  Which I didn't, but people tried to twist it and say it's all just conceited.
[02:35:03.209 --> 02:35:05.310]  The point is 98% of the film is accurate.
[02:35:05.931 --> 02:35:09.774]  And now I am here, in fact I was going to do this all day and I didn't announce it.
[02:35:12.215 --> 02:35:15.618]  There are a little over a thousand terror storms left at Amazon.com.
[02:35:16.812 --> 02:35:22.373]  There are a few left on store shelves around the country, and I've got 900 left here at my office.
[02:35:22.874 --> 02:35:32.516]  When those are sold, of the first edition, there will be no more Terror Storm, original Terror Storm, minted and printed by us, ever sold.
[02:35:33.676 --> 02:35:34.536]  That will be it.
[02:35:35.157 --> 02:35:36.017]  That will be that.
[02:35:36.477 --> 02:35:39.598]  We have a link to Amazon.com where you can get them for $12 a piece.
[02:35:39.998 --> 02:35:43.359]  You can get them as low as $9.95 in package deals at Infowars.com.
[02:35:43.899 --> 02:35:45.019]  This is how you support us.
[02:35:46.085 --> 02:35:47.847]  And just see it really as a contribution.
[02:35:47.867 --> 02:35:50.108]  But the point is, we want to sell those.
[02:35:50.789 --> 02:35:59.156]  Now, I had to make a decision not to make more and sell more to other stores in the last few months, because quietly for the last six months, I re-edited.
[02:35:59.596 --> 02:36:00.917]  This is what always happens with a film.
[02:36:02.979 --> 02:36:05.381]  We rush to make it, to get it out by a deadline.
[02:36:06.001 --> 02:36:07.903]  We did a good audio mix, good video mix.
[02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:09.670]  I think so.
[02:36:26.674 --> 02:36:31.596]  And we encoded it off the original computer in an even higher res, so it looks even crisper.
[02:36:31.837 --> 02:36:32.737]  It looked great before.
[02:36:33.377 --> 02:36:41.641]  We spent over a month remixing the audio and bringing in other music that got delivered after a deadline, so we weren't able to incorporate it.
[02:36:42.001 --> 02:36:47.164]  It has new music, it has stuff on, all this stuff, I'll tell you about it in a few months when it comes out.
[02:36:47.184 --> 02:36:48.745]  It'll be out in late July.
[02:36:49.385 --> 02:36:55.788]  But in the meantime, when these are sold, in fact we'll probably sell out of these, and then for a while there won't be any Terraforms available.
[02:36:57.443 --> 02:37:05.588]  Get the original Terror Storm, support us, and enshrine in it the fact that the Metro paper is free.
[02:37:05.628 --> 02:37:08.129]  I mean, he bought a paper, I got the paper wrong that he bought.
[02:37:08.149 --> 02:37:10.351]  It doesn't matter, it's inconsequential.
[02:37:10.691 --> 02:37:17.175]  Everyone knows Blair's approval ratings did go up, and he was able to stay the Prime Minister at a time when there were demands for him to step down.
[02:37:17.896 --> 02:37:23.779]  And so there's really no, but you know what, just for history, have the original one for yourself, for your archives.
[02:37:24.679 --> 02:37:28.921]  It is very, very important to have Terror Storm.
[02:37:29.821 --> 02:37:30.942]  And please get it.
[02:37:30.982 --> 02:37:32.422]  It's at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:33.883 --> 02:37:35.864]  Let's drive it back up the Amazon charts.
[02:37:35.904 --> 02:37:42.747]  It went to number one in documentary films for a week, beating Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth propaganda film.
[02:37:43.579 --> 02:37:44.240]  For just a week.
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:47.543]  And it hit number 8 on the total Amazon charts.
[02:37:47.743 --> 02:37:48.865]  Frankly, not that hard to do it.
[02:37:49.305 --> 02:37:51.427]  You sell a thousand of them in a couple days, that happens.
[02:37:52.148 --> 02:37:54.631]  And I get a huge princely sum of like 50 cents a piece.
[02:37:54.691 --> 02:37:58.374]  But the point is, Amazon demands 60-something percent off.
[02:37:58.955 --> 02:38:02.198]  So I think the distributor sells them to them for like $4 or something.
[02:38:02.899 --> 02:38:04.601]  But the point is, it's about getting the word out.
[02:38:05.615 --> 02:38:07.276]  I actually lose money having a distributor.
[02:38:07.616 --> 02:38:10.517]  If I'm just the only source to sell these, we end up making more.
[02:38:10.817 --> 02:38:14.738]  I've made decisions not according to business, but according to getting the word out.
[02:38:15.058 --> 02:38:17.719]  That's our currency here, is fighting these people.
[02:38:18.199 --> 02:38:19.300]  So please support us.
[02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:23.001]  Go drive it up the charts one more time at Amazon.com.
[02:38:23.021 --> 02:38:24.362]  Let's sell out what they've got.
[02:38:25.202 --> 02:38:28.123]  We've got 900, or a little less than 900, here in the office.
[02:38:28.143 --> 02:38:29.764]  You can also buy them from us.
[02:38:29.824 --> 02:38:30.804]  In the second edition,
[02:38:32.359 --> 02:38:36.302]  Uh, which is, let me see, the other one was 113 minutes and we've added almost 17.
[02:38:36.902 --> 02:38:40.605]  Uh, so we're talking well over two hours long.
[02:38:40.625 --> 02:38:45.548]  Uh, we're talking about, uh, you know, 130 minutes long.
[02:38:46.709 --> 02:38:50.212]  And, uh, we're, and it's just, it's so much more powerful.
[02:38:50.272 --> 02:38:52.033]  The music, the video, the editing.
[02:38:52.637 --> 02:38:54.839]  I mean, it really is a much stronger film now.
[02:38:55.841 --> 02:38:57.462]  But it's not going to be out for a couple months.
[02:38:58.063 --> 02:39:00.205]  And let's get the old Terror Storm out there.
[02:39:01.006 --> 02:39:02.007]  Now, I said put him on hold.
[02:39:02.067 --> 02:39:03.489]  Mike, anything else from England?
[02:39:03.949 --> 02:39:05.651]  Are you mad about me talking bad about the Queen?
[02:39:06.957 --> 02:39:07.797]  Uh, not really.
[02:39:07.957 --> 02:39:12.619]  Well, I think our head of state could deserve a little bit more respect, but that's... Yeah, you're mad about it.
[02:39:12.879 --> 02:39:24.424]  Your head of state, a criminal family that has kept people in serfdom, and enslaved, and has done great evil, but you associate yourself with her, don't you?
[02:39:26.945 --> 02:39:30.827]  Well, I'm British, but my point is... Oh my God.
[02:39:33.105 --> 02:39:41.669]  You said that there was a link between the 5th of May elections and the July 7th terrorist attacks, when there wasn't, because the May elections happened before.
[02:39:41.689 --> 02:39:45.051]  So that is a complete mistake.
[02:39:45.071 --> 02:39:49.213]  No, you twisted what I said, and we actually went back to the audio files.
[02:39:49.233 --> 02:39:52.695]  What would happen is I would come in and talk about something, okay?
[02:39:52.715 --> 02:39:53.935]  I literally wouldn't even write it.
[02:39:53.975 --> 02:39:57.377]  I would look at all the documents in front of me, and I would talk into the microphone, okay?
[02:39:57.757 --> 02:40:01.219]  And then, literally, it was two people, me and Rob Jacobson, making that movie.
[02:40:01.779 --> 02:40:03.100]  And so it's not clear.
[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:05.601]  And that's what we were saying.
[02:40:05.641 --> 02:40:07.561]  You can twist that all day long.
[02:40:07.621 --> 02:40:10.963]  Everyone knows Tony Blair's approval rating went up due to the bombings.
[02:40:10.983 --> 02:40:16.845]  Everyone knows that he could be removed or voted out even without an election, with a no-confidence vote in the Parliament.
[02:40:17.125 --> 02:40:20.707]  And that's the point.
[02:40:20.727 --> 02:40:24.428]  Hey brother, we've been public about that semi-mistake there.
[02:40:25.149 --> 02:40:26.629]  And in the metro paper thing, I know.
[02:40:26.789 --> 02:40:29.510]  But your queen is still a piece of trash.
[02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:30.270]  Okay?
[02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:33.151]  She's still a murdering piece of garbage.
[02:40:34.291 --> 02:40:34.751]  Okay?
[02:40:35.231 --> 02:40:36.531]  I know why you called.
[02:40:36.791 --> 02:40:42.673]  You called because she's a piece of garbage and you think your head of state deserves a little more respect.
[02:40:43.233 --> 02:40:49.234]  Sir, her ancestor waged war in this country and killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:40:50.066 --> 02:40:53.988]  Okay, you know about Edward VIII, that little Nazi punk.
[02:40:54.408 --> 02:40:57.490]  Do you understand you have Germanic rulers?
[02:40:58.030 --> 02:41:04.793]  And the Anglo-American establishment has wreaked hell on Earth, all over the world, and she is not your queen!
[02:41:05.634 --> 02:41:07.114]  Can't you get that through your head?
[02:41:07.354 --> 02:41:11.416]  Can't you get that Prince Charles told Diana he was going to kill her in an auto accident?
[02:41:13.778 --> 02:41:18.600]  I'm not a big fan of royalty, but anyway, my second point I wanted to make was,
[02:41:19.116 --> 02:41:22.279]  You said that the bombers did not know that they had bombs in their backpacks.
[02:41:22.379 --> 02:41:24.141]  That was another big point of your movie.
[02:41:24.562 --> 02:41:27.164]  Yeah, Mohammed Sadiq Khan recorded a martyrdom video.
[02:41:28.465 --> 02:41:30.047]  So that blows that one out the window.
[02:41:30.107 --> 02:41:30.728]  No, no.
[02:41:30.888 --> 02:41:32.489]  Now see, that's not a mistake right there.
[02:41:32.610 --> 02:41:38.656]  It's the Scotland Yard said that it appeared that some of the bombers did not know they had bombs in their backpacks.
[02:41:41.779 --> 02:41:41.899]  Hello?
[02:41:42.597 --> 02:41:43.678]  You're on the air, buddy!
[02:41:44.899 --> 02:41:49.964]  Well, are you saying that Mohammad Sadiq Khan knew that he was a suicide bomber and the other three didn't know that?
[02:41:51.286 --> 02:41:56.050]  What they did is they had them go through drills, sir, and we know they were being protected.
[02:41:56.431 --> 02:42:02.717]  We know that the head of their organization was known, MI6, the SWAT guy.
[02:42:03.077 --> 02:42:03.958]  That's on record.
[02:42:03.998 --> 02:42:04.999]  It's all in the film.
[02:42:06.730 --> 02:42:10.451]  Okay, but you still... You're not listening to me.
[02:42:10.471 --> 02:42:11.052]  Sir, sir, sir.
[02:42:11.532 --> 02:42:18.495]  Is it admitted that the government with visor consultants was running a drill of the exact same trains being bombed at the exact same time?
[02:42:20.075 --> 02:42:21.576]  That seems to be pretty clear, yes.
[02:42:22.016 --> 02:42:22.356]  Okay.
[02:42:23.276 --> 02:42:28.618]  Has the British government been caught provocateuring and outright staging terror attacks before?
[02:42:30.519 --> 02:42:32.620]  That's true, but you've made... No, no, let's go further.
[02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:33.620]  Let's go further.
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:34.381]  Let's go further.
[02:42:34.521 --> 02:42:35.221]  Did Blair...
[02:42:36.258 --> 02:42:39.019]  Did Blair get a boost in his approval ratings after the bombing?
[02:42:40.539 --> 02:42:41.339]  Uh, I'm not sure.
[02:42:41.699 --> 02:42:41.999]  He did.
[02:42:42.019 --> 02:42:43.260]  Look, I'm done talking to you, man.
[02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:43.940]  Okay?
[02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:46.441]  The film is accurate.
[02:42:46.901 --> 02:42:52.762]  I can watch an hour-long Nightline special and find every other thing being a lie on purpose by design.
[02:42:53.302 --> 02:42:55.323]  Now, what you're doing is twisting things.
[02:42:55.743 --> 02:42:59.104]  And you're reading right off that government-commissioned university attack on me.
[02:42:59.944 --> 02:43:00.224]  Okay?
[02:43:01.332 --> 02:43:01.953]  I know this.
[02:43:02.173 --> 02:43:06.397]  There's no doubt that they arrest people for videotaping on the streets of London now.
[02:43:06.437 --> 02:43:08.699]  There's no doubt they're banning protests and demonstrations.
[02:43:08.979 --> 02:43:10.721]  There's no doubt your country's in deep trouble.
[02:43:11.581 --> 02:43:11.942]  Okay?
[02:43:12.983 --> 02:43:15.124]  Look, I have a great respect for the British people.
[02:43:16.105 --> 02:43:16.446]  Okay?
[02:43:16.746 --> 02:43:20.790]  America was founded out of the Magna Carta in 1215.
[02:43:21.270 --> 02:43:25.574]  It was founded out of support in Parliament and ideas of liberty.
[02:43:27.288 --> 02:43:47.427]  And your parliament barely voted for the war when your first German king, no, his father was brought over, when King George III, when he wasn't literally running around thinking he was God, insanely, dancing around, and having visions and everything else, he was there in your parliament.
[02:43:48.748 --> 02:43:50.730]  And so, my name is Jones.
[02:43:51.411 --> 02:43:56.795]  So, you know, my father's family had a lot of Welsh in it, and Scotch, and Irish, and I'm a Heinz 57.
[02:43:57.956 --> 02:43:58.697]  Get it through your head.
[02:43:58.717 --> 02:44:06.083]  You know, people think when I attack George Bush, I get emails going, How dare you talk about the leader of our country and attack America!
[02:44:06.943 --> 02:44:08.344]  That's not America!
[02:44:09.185 --> 02:44:11.387]  George Bush is not the United States!
[02:44:12.196 --> 02:44:19.320]  And when Hillary Clinton gets elected, because I'm sure patriots won't support Ron Paul like they should, he could win, though, folks, if you took action.
[02:44:20.321 --> 02:44:25.264]  It'll all be, you know, talk about her, you're just against women, and you're just against the people from Illinois.
[02:44:25.844 --> 02:44:26.885]  I've had enough of it!
[02:44:26.905 --> 02:44:31.007]  Do you understand, you know what the royalty did to you guys?
[02:44:31.707 --> 02:44:34.589]  You know how they've treated you and the things they've done?
[02:44:37.711 --> 02:44:38.871]  They're disgusting!
[02:44:39.912 --> 02:44:41.453]  They're disgusting filth!
[02:44:42.725 --> 02:44:44.286]  She is not the head of your country!
[02:44:45.066 --> 02:44:46.146]  She's an imposter!
[02:44:46.726 --> 02:45:09.213]  Do you know what the royalty, really starting with the Norse rulers that came in out of northern France, I mean the things they did, the untold millions they killed with the sword, enslaving the once free tribes, talk about the slaughter in Africa, the process of domination there,
[02:45:10.535 --> 02:45:21.620]  You know, they took the average genotype in England, the average skeleton was right at six feet from 4,000 years ago, and literally brought it down to about five foot one.
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:28.923]  I'm not saying height means anything, but for the royalty, they actually wrote things about how to get people starving, how to control them.
[02:45:29.243 --> 02:45:30.043]  It was a royal thing.
[02:45:30.103 --> 02:45:32.344]  If they ate more food, so they were bigger than you.
[02:45:32.864 --> 02:45:37.306]  They like turned this into little bonsai trees for them, just because it makes them feel more powerful.
[02:45:38.081 --> 02:45:40.322]  I mean, these are ultimate scum.
[02:45:40.662 --> 02:45:42.802]  These are ultimate enemies of humanity.
[02:45:43.563 --> 02:45:46.184]  These are the people, sir, running the eugenics.
[02:45:46.544 --> 02:45:49.084]  These are the people that are going to give you the big carbon tax.
[02:45:49.545 --> 02:45:52.245]  These are the people that are going to do all these things to you.
[02:45:54.906 --> 02:45:56.247]  Don't you understand that?
[02:45:58.927 --> 02:46:00.328]  I mean, my gosh!
[02:46:00.888 --> 02:46:01.788]  Someone else disagrees.
[02:46:01.848 --> 02:46:04.329]  Let's go to Roger in Florida.
[02:46:04.349 --> 02:46:04.989]  Go ahead, Roger.
[02:46:05.770 --> 02:46:06.050]  Hello.
[02:46:06.430 --> 02:46:06.930]  Hi, go ahead.
[02:46:07.785 --> 02:46:33.612]  Hey Alex, the only thing I do agree with you is that she is a female dog, but as far as her having a lot of influence in Canada and Canada being royal followers, it's a phenomenon to us that when we watch the United States, how Americans just eat this stuff up.
[02:46:34.869 --> 02:46:38.592]  You know, when she dies, I hope she's the last piece of crap that's on our money.
[02:46:41.593 --> 02:46:44.355]  The majority of Canadians are not big, loyal fans.
[02:46:44.995 --> 02:46:45.636]  I understand that.
[02:46:45.836 --> 02:46:48.037]  I'm not saying the British people... I'm not knocking Brits.
[02:46:48.197 --> 02:46:49.158]  Brits are Canadians.
[02:46:49.178 --> 02:46:49.878]  No, no, no.
[02:46:49.998 --> 02:46:52.160]  I'm not knocking Brits.
[02:46:52.220 --> 02:46:54.601]  So, are you in Florida or are you in Canada?
[02:46:55.041 --> 02:46:56.302]  I'm in Florida, but I'm a Canadian.
[02:46:56.322 --> 02:46:56.702]  Okay, good.
[02:46:56.722 --> 02:46:57.383]  Now I'm not confused.
[02:46:57.423 --> 02:46:57.683]  All right.
[02:47:00.936 --> 02:47:12.844]  I'm not talking about influence as in a bunch of dumb Americans who I routinely say are the dumbest of the dumb, once the greatest of the great.
[02:47:12.904 --> 02:47:14.505]  I'm not saying all Americans.
[02:47:14.866 --> 02:47:16.507]  I mean, on average, it's pathetic.
[02:47:17.145 --> 02:47:22.086]  And I've said that Canadians and Brits and people are actually more informed on many subjects.
[02:47:22.406 --> 02:47:26.627]  I'm not bashing... When I say influence, I mean wealth.
[02:47:27.087 --> 02:47:30.088]  That lady in Forbes is worth like 10 billion bucks.
[02:47:30.468 --> 02:47:32.048]  They're all about hiding their wealth.
[02:47:32.388 --> 02:47:34.709]  I mean, literally, sir, she owns most of England.
[02:47:35.049 --> 02:47:37.349]  She owns most... I mean, she owns diamond mines.
[02:47:40.030 --> 02:47:42.530]  She does not get any monies from Canada.
[02:47:42.670 --> 02:47:44.431]  That was taken out...
[02:47:46.812 --> 02:47:47.732]  It's not money from the Treasury.
[02:47:47.792 --> 02:47:48.453]  Are you kidding?
[02:47:48.473 --> 02:47:49.053]  No, it's in private hands.
[02:47:49.073 --> 02:47:49.713]  She privately owns the stuff.
[02:47:49.733 --> 02:47:51.094]  Sir, she was a shareholder in the Bank of England.
[02:48:08.706 --> 02:48:09.186]  Oh, I'm sure.
[02:48:09.727 --> 02:48:12.188]  The Bank of England controls... England's not Canada.
[02:48:12.788 --> 02:48:19.072]  You know, the Bank of England was involved in chartering and made the investments in your Bank of Canada.
[02:48:19.472 --> 02:48:20.432]  You're mistaken.
[02:48:20.492 --> 02:48:22.654]  They've made investments in all banks in the world.
[02:48:22.994 --> 02:48:25.595]  Sure, but the Queen of England literally owns your currency.
[02:48:25.995 --> 02:48:27.136]  She's on your currency.
[02:48:27.436 --> 02:48:31.258]  Yeah, and as soon as she dies, that bitch will be the last one to be on her currency.
[02:48:31.898 --> 02:48:36.801]  I hear ya, I hear ya, and just remember what a Queen Elizabeth is.
[02:48:36.881 --> 02:48:38.282]  I'm sorry, I just have to coin it.
[02:48:39.324 --> 02:48:40.285]  Uh, she's a Queen Elizabeth.
[02:48:41.346 --> 02:48:45.910]  It's here.
[02:48:46.130 --> 02:48:50.915]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:51.275 --> 02:48:58.882]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:59.614 --> 02:49:06.658]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:07.058 --> 02:49:18.504]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:18.804 --> 02:49:22.306]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:22.766 --> 02:49:24.707]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:25.027 --> 02:49:28.869]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.092 --> 02:49:47.873]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:48.153 --> 02:49:52.294]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:52.714 --> 02:49:53.554]  So what do you do?
[02:49:53.874 --> 02:49:58.435]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:49:58.915 --> 02:50:01.037]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:01.537 --> 02:50:16.249]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:16.289 --> 02:50:23.355]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:43.701]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:43.921 --> 02:50:47.622]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:47.942 --> 02:50:50.162]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:50.683 --> 02:50:56.884]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:50:57.045 --> 02:51:01.886]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:02.146 --> 02:51:11.154]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[02:51:11.494 --> 02:51:17.019]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[02:51:19.249 --> 02:51:19.849]  I think so.
[02:51:43.371 --> 02:51:46.112]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:46.132 --> 02:51:50.033]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:50.574 --> 02:51:56.056]  Alright, I'm going to at least get to Michael, Richard, and who's calling from Vermont?
[02:51:57.276 --> 02:51:58.877]  James, I'll try to jam those three in.
[02:51:59.877 --> 02:52:02.998]  But I promised, I had all these clips today, I didn't get to them, on the Queen.
[02:52:03.658 --> 02:52:07.820]  This is people walking in the reception hall in the White House, about to go in to the Queen.
[02:52:08.903 --> 02:52:12.906]  And, uh, this is Colin Powell walking up, and you can just see his face, he's so proud.
[02:52:13.487 --> 02:52:16.950]  I am the Order of the Goddard, Knight Commander!
[02:52:16.970 --> 02:52:19.452]  Everyone's like, ooooh, ooooh!
[02:52:19.472 --> 02:52:21.753]  I mean, you know, that's, it's just pathetic!
[02:52:21.774 --> 02:52:25.056]  I mean, this is, this is, they're nobodies!
[02:52:26.197 --> 02:52:27.038]  These are killers!
[02:52:27.742 --> 02:52:29.222]  It just shows how far we've slipped.
[02:52:29.282 --> 02:52:31.403]  They would never do this 20 years ago, 30 years ago.
[02:52:31.423 --> 02:52:33.384]  I mean, this is just pathetic.
[02:52:33.424 --> 02:52:33.844]  Here it is.
[02:52:34.504 --> 02:52:38.225]  Anne Armstrong, the Knight Commander of the Order of the Bat.
[02:52:38.645 --> 02:52:41.926]  I can't even hear it, guys.
[02:52:42.126 --> 02:52:46.387]  Her Majesty gave it to Al and to me about 12 years ago.
[02:52:46.827 --> 02:52:48.028]  Knight Commander.
[02:52:48.128 --> 02:52:49.228]  Listen carefully.
[02:52:49.408 --> 02:52:51.229]  Knight Commander of the Order of the Bat.
[02:52:51.329 --> 02:52:52.009]  Same thing.
[02:52:57.265 --> 02:52:59.128]  Did all that go over air or should we play it again?
[02:52:59.148 --> 02:53:01.552]  Oh, we'll just play it one more time at the intro.
[02:53:01.592 --> 02:53:02.033]  I want to hear it.
[02:53:02.982 --> 02:53:07.025]  And Armstrong, the Knight Commander of the Order of the Battles.
[02:53:07.065 --> 02:53:09.467]  Knight Commander of the Order of the Battles.
[02:53:09.487 --> 02:53:15.732]  Her Majesty gave it to Almon and to me about 12 years ago.
[02:53:15.752 --> 02:53:16.573]  Knight Commander.
[02:53:17.233 --> 02:53:18.014]  Listen here.
[02:53:18.034 --> 02:53:20.736]  Knight Commander of the Order of the Battles.
[02:53:20.976 --> 02:53:21.656]  Oh gosh.
[02:53:21.817 --> 02:53:24.759]  And there's stuff a lot worse.
[02:53:24.799 --> 02:53:27.241]  It's hard to hear it without the video with it.
[02:53:27.841 --> 02:53:31.084]  But we're going to post some of the most disgusting stuff up on JonesReport.com.
[02:53:32.094 --> 02:53:34.495]  Please do support us in our fight against these creatures.
[02:53:34.996 --> 02:53:39.398]  We don't own the oil companies or the banks that issue the currency.
[02:53:40.138 --> 02:53:45.021]  It's just up to you to support us and to support Ron Paul and others in this fight against the New World Order.
[02:53:45.061 --> 02:53:48.783]  So please go to Infowars.com and remember the original Terror Storm.
[02:53:48.863 --> 02:53:49.884]  Very few of them left.
[02:53:50.004 --> 02:53:52.905]  You know, up to late July when the second edition comes out.
[02:53:53.045 --> 02:53:56.287]  Get the first edition and it makes what we do here possible as well.
[02:53:56.327 --> 02:53:59.129]  Get America, Freedom, and Fascism, all of them, from Infowars.com.
[02:54:00.649 --> 02:54:02.509]  Let's go to Jane in Vermont.
[02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:04.670]  Jane, go ahead.
[02:54:04.990 --> 02:54:05.550]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:06.510 --> 02:54:24.874]  I was listening on C-SPAN to the acceptance speech of Sarkozy in France, and I wanted to know if anybody else, if you'd been discussing this, during the speech he announced the Mediterranean Union, and he was welcoming everyone in Europe to the Mediterranean Union, and as part of that, he welcomed the North
[02:54:26.013 --> 02:54:31.095]  North African, peoples of North Africa to join the Mediterranean Union.
[02:54:31.915 --> 02:54:46.820]  You know, I didn't see his speech, but yeah, no, no, they have ten sub-regions, three major mega-states, they're already functioning, the North American Union, EU, Asian Union, the African Union's already deploying troops all over the place.
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:50.641]  I mean, it's all in place, and you tell the general public, and they go, no, it doesn't exist!
[02:54:51.961 --> 02:54:54.242]  Was it emerging into France of the North Africans?
[02:54:55.772 --> 02:54:58.973]  That's pretty much what they're all basically doing.
[02:54:59.013 --> 02:55:01.094]  I didn't see his speech, but I know that that's what's happening.
[02:55:02.195 --> 02:55:03.555]  Well, I'll tell you, Francis is in trouble.
[02:55:04.295 --> 02:55:06.576]  Oh, yeah, and of course he's another fake conservative.
[02:55:06.616 --> 02:55:08.137]  He'll fool them, just like the Socialists.
[02:55:08.497 --> 02:55:09.517]  They own both the horses.
[02:55:09.537 --> 02:55:10.077]  We're out of time.
[02:55:10.137 --> 02:55:10.738]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:11.058 --> 02:55:12.018]  Michael in Ohio.
[02:55:12.038 --> 02:55:12.658]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:55:14.379 --> 02:55:15.159]  Yes, Alex?
[02:55:15.379 --> 02:55:15.640]  Yes.
[02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:19.661]  Yeah, I'm calling about a big New World Order company.
[02:55:19.941 --> 02:55:21.001]  They're the biggest I know.
[02:55:21.662 --> 02:55:23.562]  Maybe you don't know of them, or maybe you do.
[02:55:23.582 --> 02:55:24.323]  It's called the USIS.
[02:55:26.297 --> 02:55:38.123]  And they're in charge of just about everything that has to do with applications for jobs, like they do drug testing, they're behind all the secret security clearances for the government.
[02:55:39.463 --> 02:55:44.586]  I don't know if he was aware of them or not, but they have a weird thing on their website about James Garfield.
[02:55:44.606 --> 02:55:46.947]  They're like laughing that he was assassinated.
[02:55:48.428 --> 02:55:50.089]  And I can read it for you if you want.
[02:55:50.289 --> 02:55:50.929]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:55:51.389 --> 02:55:54.011]  It says, when President James A. Garfield decided in 1881
[02:55:55.658 --> 02:56:00.421]  Federal positions should be awarded by merit and not according to political patronage.
[02:56:01.002 --> 02:56:02.062]  He sealed his fate.
[02:56:02.263 --> 02:56:07.126]  He was assassinated by Charles Guto and an act of vengeance... Wow!
[02:56:07.206 --> 02:56:07.906]  You know what?
[02:56:08.066 --> 02:56:09.347]  Email me that subpage.
[02:56:09.928 --> 02:56:11.629]  I want to do a piece on that.
[02:56:11.689 --> 02:56:11.969]  Thank you.
[02:56:12.009 --> 02:56:12.549]  We're out of time.
[02:56:12.589 --> 02:56:13.590]  Sorry to all the other callers.
[02:56:14.070 --> 02:56:16.432]  More calls, more big guests coming up tomorrow.
[02:56:16.972 --> 02:56:18.133]  Help us get the word out.
[02:56:18.173 --> 02:56:19.394]  Help us fight the globalists.
