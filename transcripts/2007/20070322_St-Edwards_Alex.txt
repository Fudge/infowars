[00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:32.411]  This is our guest speaker today, Alex Jones, and many of you will probably know Alex Jones from any number of sources of media, including his nationally syndicated radio talk show, which is then also broadcast on Austin Cable Access on television.
[00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:43.133]  Alex Jones is also a documentary filmmaker, and to this date he's made 15 films, including his latest, Terror Storm, which is a history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:51.837]  He also has two websites, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, that some of you may have visited.
[00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:58.683]  And you might have seen him also on television in any number of newsmaker interviews as well.
[00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:06.890]  I don't know how many of you saw Richard Linklater's recent film called Scanner Darkly, but Alex Jones is also featured in that particular film.
[00:01:12.403 --> 00:01:19.609]  We'll see that he has over 27,000 friends on that, which I think is quite an accomplishment.
[00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.732]  I heard of Alex back in 1993, when I first came to St.
[00:01:23.732 --> 00:01:29.857]  Edward's to teach here, and that was just a few months after the incident in Waco.
[00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:41.827]  As we all know, that just so briefly, it was, you know, the Branch Davidians had stolen POW weapons, and when they were confronted, they, you know, set themselves on fire, and that was the official line.
[00:01:42.965 --> 00:02:01.890]  But there was a show in Austin called the Jeff Davis Show, there was a filmmaker by the name of Linda Thompson, and also Alex Jones who questioned that official line, and who said that the US government had really infringed quite seriously on the constitutional rights of US citizens, undermining civil liberties.
[00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:10.252]  And in fact, Alex Jones became, after that incident, quite a standard-bearer for those who, again, were suspicious of
[00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:17.010]  The official line, and we're looking for alternative explanations for these particular events.
[00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.793]  And so he's quite a high profile in Austin in terms of his radio show.
[00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:27.399]  You also see him out in public with his signature bullhorn speaking truth to power.
[00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:37.688]  So when 9-11 happened, I think it was fairly natural and understandable that a lot of people would seek out Alex's sources of information in his radio show and his websites.
[00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:45.268]  To answer questions that a lot of people were dissatisfied with the official answers.
[00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:51.391]  And things didn't seem to fit together really after 9-11.
[00:02:51.391 --> 00:03:02.617]  So there was a lot of people, it wasn't just college students, it was university professors, it was scientists, it was people from all walks of life who were interested in what Alex had to say.
[00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:05.178]  And this group, very diverse and numerous,
[00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:11.015]  So coalesce into what is now the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:18.781]  The corporate media will label Alex Jones a conspiracy theorist as a way of discrediting him.
[00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:26.647]  But I'm very glad that Alex Jones is here today with us in person to talk about the 9-11 Truth Movement and to answer your questions.
[00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:28.609]  So please join me in welcoming Alex Jones.
[00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:40.094]  It's great to be visiting all you fellow Austinites.
[00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:44.115]  My sister's 15 years younger than me and she actually goes to school here.
[00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:54.497]  And Trey back there is a senior about to graduate and he runs my Sunday syndicated show at KLBJ 590 from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:57.658]  So I have a lot of connections to your fine institution here.
[00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:01.142]  This is a rhetoric class.
[00:04:01.142 --> 00:04:10.524]  There's also some people here from some of the other classes that your professor teaches concerning the media.
[00:04:10.524 --> 00:04:18.286]  And so a lot of you are involved in media or you're interested in having a career in journalism or somewhere in communications.
[00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:22.406]  How many of you plan to be in communications?
[00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:23.286]  So most of you.
[00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:25.767]  Well good then because that's what I'm going to be talking about.
[00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:46.732]  You're going to get the more sedate Alex Jones because I am not a morning person.
[00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:47.653]  It takes me some time.
[00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:51.155]  I've been up about three hours and I'm just starting to wake up here.
[00:04:51.155 --> 00:05:02.621]  But number one, since 9-11 was raised, let me just start at the end and talk about September 11th and then get into media and alternative media and what's happening in the world.
[00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:03.882]  When popular mechanics
[00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:05.714]  It's all lies.
[00:05:30.936 --> 00:05:34.520]  The 9-11 Commission comes out, appointed by Bush, and calls itself independent.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.001]  Appointed by Bush, independent.
[00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:39.364]  They first don't have Henry Kissinger as the head of it.
[00:05:39.364 --> 00:05:42.427]  Mr. Whitewash, Mr. Kingmaker, Mr. Corruption.
[00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:44.489]  All the way back to Nixon.
[00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:45.891]  You name it, he's involved in it.
[00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:47.074]  We're good to go.
[00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:36.362]  Justice Department are told by Tony Snow, Fox News, now being more honest about his position than intelligence operative basically, to just sit up there and lie to the public and twist and spin.
[00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:45.047]  So when you investigate 9-11, actually go check out the debunkers first and then I want you to go research their debunking and find out they're lying to you.
[00:06:46.232 --> 00:06:54.895]  Now, just because the mainstream media is bought and paid for, predominantly by foreign banking interests, doesn't mean that everybody in the media is bad or corrupt.
[00:06:54.895 --> 00:07:00.437]  Most of them, again, are highly controlled by their editors, they're told what they can write about, and you're going to experience that.
[00:07:00.437 --> 00:07:09.661]  I would challenge you, in your life, to have your own alternative media ventures that you're involved in, whether it reaches 10 people or 100, it doesn't matter, it's very valid, and then go experience
[00:07:37.008 --> 00:07:39.049]  Again, I'm already digressing.
[00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:51.296]  At the same time, much of the mainstream media is controlled, bought, and paid for by gatekeepers, by intelligence operatives, by idea men, by PR firms, by think tanks.
[00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:59.861]  But just because the mainstream media is riddled with propaganda, spin lies, and some truth, doesn't mean the alternative media is completely trustworthy.
[00:07:59.861 --> 00:08:04.083]  And that's why I say verify the information you hear.
[00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:04.884]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:08:07.609 --> 00:08:08.329]  We're good to go.
[00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:44.133]  I'm attacked for what somebody else has said.
[00:08:44.133 --> 00:09:03.143]  And doing this for the many years I've been doing it, I've learned more and more that in many cases it later comes out that people that were putting out ridiculous theories and kooky ideas that couldn't be verified and were almost tailor-made to look ridiculous were indeed on the payroll of large corporations that were being
[00:09:12.688 --> 00:09:13.649]  We're good to go.
[00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:34.052]  We're good to go.
[00:10:05.336 --> 00:10:19.821]  So if you look at the different Google numbers and different media think tanks that have done studies on it and different institutions that have looked at it, that alternative media about two years ago surpassed all what you call dominant mainstream or old line dinosaur media.
[00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:32.906]  So dinosaur media was up here, I remember 10 years ago you talked to reporters, they'd be on incredible power trips, TV reporters thought they were God, it was all about their own personal power and you know towing the line, being
[00:10:36.792 --> 00:10:39.513]  Eddie Movie Star, I guess you could say.
[00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:48.277]  They would do almost anything and say anything to kiss up to the defense contractor corporations, the military industrial complex that own them.
[00:10:48.277 --> 00:10:53.079]  Now you don't see that arrogance because the mainline media is laying people off.
[00:10:53.079 --> 00:10:59.481]  Depending on which set of numbers you look at, in the last 10 years, newspaper circulation is down around 60%.
[00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:06.464]  Now they like to every year say, oh we were down 6%, we were down 9%, we were down 4% and different institutions put out different numbers.
[00:11:11.823 --> 00:11:12.563]  We're good to go.
[00:11:49.577 --> 00:11:52.859]  So I would encourage all of you to go out now.
[00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:54.859]  Don't wait.
[00:11:54.859 --> 00:11:56.320]  Start your own website.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.181]  Start your own webpage.
[00:12:16.581 --> 00:12:35.655]  Then fine, go have some MySpace account if you want, but it's more important to have your own webpage, your own name, your own information, and it doesn't matter if your story's about, you know, go adopt a dog, or if your story's about prison corruption, and the things that people are going through in these institutions.
[00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:43.460]  As long as you're doing something that you think's important, and that is important to you, and as long as you're trying to tell the story as best you can, and
[00:12:45.313 --> 00:12:52.796]  As long as you are attempting to represent the truth to the people, if you build it, they will come.
[00:12:52.796 --> 00:13:02.620]  And regardless, it's a good exercise in your own life to just take those first steps and start creating your own media because it helps you look at your own self.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.802]  And it helps you to basically become a bigger person, in my opinion.
[00:13:07.802 --> 00:13:13.605]  It's a focusing tool to more closely, consciously look at the world.
[00:13:15.478 --> 00:13:20.319]  Many, many years ago, I started doing an AXS TV show.
[00:13:20.319 --> 00:13:23.540]  In fact, at first I just volunteered and was a guest on a few of the shows.
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.501]  And then by 1995, I was doing my own TV show.
[00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:30.421]  And I still do that AXS TV show.
[00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:33.762]  I mean, I go down there, there's no commercials, nobody tells me what I can say.
[00:13:33.762 --> 00:13:36.562]  I don't have to worry about dealing with sponsors.
[00:13:36.562 --> 00:13:39.223]  I don't have to worry about anything.
[00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:45.908]  And I just go down there, turn on the lights, and got my one-man crew, sometimes a two-person crew down there.
[00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:51.591]  And we just do the show, and we just cover the news and analyze the news, and I give mainly my opinion on it.
[00:13:51.591 --> 00:13:56.814]  And then we do a lot of original research, and we'll also present those reports from time to time.
[00:13:56.814 --> 00:14:03.738]  And frankly, I do it so much, the main problem I face is that I have to keep myself from falling asleep while I'm doing it.
[00:14:03.738 --> 00:14:04.559]  I talk so much.
[00:14:10.464 --> 00:14:14.545]  That's another challenge of the alternative media.
[00:14:14.545 --> 00:14:16.386]  You can reach tens of millions of people.
[00:14:16.386 --> 00:14:20.006]  And my website has reached about 4 million people, all 9 of them together.
[00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:23.947]  That's individual visitors, not hits as you hear.
[00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:27.048]  And my radio show reaches about 2 million people a day.
[00:14:27.048 --> 00:14:36.230]  And just on web streams, we're number one on the internet, the most listened to radio show on the internet by every major index and system like Shoutcast that are out there.
[00:14:40.782 --> 00:14:45.684]  To do that, you know, I never set about with some plan.
[00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:48.125]  I was hearing mainstream media.
[00:14:48.125 --> 00:14:49.665]  I had read a lot of history books.
[00:14:49.665 --> 00:14:52.386]  I had read autobiographies by world leaders.
[00:14:52.386 --> 00:14:54.287]  They said they were setting up a world government.
[00:14:54.287 --> 00:14:59.369]  They said that it was in the best interest that we all be dumbed down and controlled and turned into serfs.
[00:14:59.369 --> 00:15:02.050]  And then I would turn on the news and they'd say there's no world government.
[00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.331]  There's no plan for a world government.
[00:15:03.331 --> 00:15:05.051]  There's no plan for the North American Union.
[00:15:05.051 --> 00:15:08.192]  This is insane code for hurting the children.
[00:15:17.366 --> 00:15:20.489]  They're saying I can go to the UN's own website.
[00:15:20.489 --> 00:15:22.210]  You know, I can see this.
[00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.732]  I can read UN publications.
[00:15:24.732 --> 00:15:33.219]  And it was really just a process, and I'm constantly growing, I'm nobody special, of just learning and researching.
[00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:38.203]  And so I started the Access TV Show, I got a local radio show, I got a syndicated radio show.
[00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:42.286]  Simultaneously, in 1996 I started making my first documentary.
[00:15:42.286 --> 00:15:45.409]  I finished it in 1997, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:15:46.207 --> 00:15:46.928]  We're good to go.
[00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:15.814]  We're good to go.
[00:16:44.684 --> 00:16:45.845]  We're good to go.
[00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:19.239]  We're good to go.
[00:17:47.034 --> 00:17:50.357]  In 2011, I don't see it being there anymore.
[00:17:50.357 --> 00:17:56.622]  But, because I can certainly fight some local bureaucrats, but by myself, I have a lot of trouble fighting Congress.
[00:17:56.622 --> 00:18:11.213]  And that's the power of alternative media, is that information spreads virally, though, and if an idea is good enough and captures enough people's imaginations, then you get whole storms of people who are now awake, doing their own research, and getting involved in an issue.
[00:18:11.213 --> 00:18:15.417]  And that's what we could affect change in Congress, and keep it from shutting down access television.
[00:18:16.229 --> 00:18:23.020]  So I challenge you to go down to Access Television here in Austin, Texas, or wherever you live around the country.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:30.912]  They've shut down about 35% of the access facilities around the country in just the last few years, trying to shut down that venue.
[00:18:43.803 --> 00:18:44.225]  We're good.
[00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:07.546]  Never intended.
[00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:12.048]  Many people that listened to me and came out and got shows because it was that first foot in the door.
[00:19:12.048 --> 00:19:22.614]  Never knew that they'd end up writing columns for magazines that reach millions of people, like Bob Dacey, or filling in on national radio shows.
[00:19:22.614 --> 00:19:24.915]  Many of them now made award-winning films.
[00:19:24.915 --> 00:19:29.478]  Because again, I went down to AXIS TV because I wanted to go, hey, there's a plan to take your rights and set up a world government.
[00:19:35.635 --> 00:19:40.076]  Well, other talk show hosts have newsletters.
[00:19:40.076 --> 00:19:42.116]  Why don't I just make a film?
[00:19:42.116 --> 00:19:51.298]  Because the United Nations has been handed regulatory control over UNESCO of many of our national parks and monuments.
[00:19:51.298 --> 00:19:57.319]  They're grabbing land in surrounding areas and people are saying this isn't real.
[00:19:57.319 --> 00:19:59.860]  But I have federal documents.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.300]  I have a law passed in Kentucky.
[00:20:07.096 --> 00:20:20.190]  The UN signs, and I'll show people the UN plaques, and I'll show the law, and then I show up and the park rangers run up and threaten to arrest us, freaking out, telling us the UN's good.
[00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.771]  And telling us to turn our cameras off.
[00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:23.533]  See, we didn't know that would happen.
[00:20:23.533 --> 00:20:27.678]  I didn't know back in 96, 97 how bad things were.
[00:20:27.678 --> 00:20:28.859]  I mean, it was shocking.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.180]  They always show us the tyranny.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.461]  And sometimes they show us that they're good people.
[00:20:36.461 --> 00:20:38.922]  So we started the Access TV Show.
[00:20:38.922 --> 00:20:42.682]  And, you know, back then there really weren't a lot of ways to break into the media.
[00:20:42.682 --> 00:20:44.523]  Now there are even more ways.
[00:20:44.523 --> 00:20:51.165]  But the key is that you need to be part of this revolution now.
[00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:53.365]  And now is the time to get in on it.
[00:20:53.365 --> 00:21:00.707]  And now is the time to take whatever your passion is, whatever your beliefs are, whatever you think is important, and put it into
[00:21:06.586 --> 00:21:11.449]  Don't have the goal of making it big time and being on national television.
[00:21:11.449 --> 00:21:13.970]  Which does nothing by the way.
[00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:26.055]  Frankly, I'll go on some mom and pop radio station in some middle sized city and I'll get a bigger response off a two hour interview there than I will get being on Good Morning America or CNN.
[00:21:26.055 --> 00:21:30.257]  Because the people that really watch that are dead folks.
[00:21:30.257 --> 00:21:31.257]  Okay?
[00:21:31.257 --> 00:21:32.878]  When you drive down your street at night
[00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:33.750]  I think so.
[00:21:53.783 --> 00:21:54.543]  We're good to go.
[00:21:54.543 --> 00:21:55.304]  We're good to go.
[00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:23.350]  We're good to go.
[00:22:40.287 --> 00:22:40.907]  We're good to go.
[00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:11.991]  We're good to go.
[00:23:42.489 --> 00:23:51.775]  People say technology is neutral, and that's the case with most things like a firearm, or a computer, or a machete.
[00:23:51.775 --> 00:24:01.060]  But with televisions, because of the whole way it's designed, and because of the flicker rate, and the scan rate that has been adopted that just so happens in the U.S.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.002]  standard to be the perfect one for mesmerizing someone,
[00:24:08.983 --> 00:24:11.124]  And you can also look at numbers in the 50s.
[00:24:11.124 --> 00:24:17.608]  You can argue about statistics, but certainly we know people seeing violence desensitizes it to them, gives them an appetite for it.
[00:24:17.608 --> 00:24:26.053]  In the 50s, you have a very low violence rate in this country, and then television becomes widely accepted and violence begins increasing, and we see violence in the real world increasing.
[00:24:26.053 --> 00:24:36.999]  That's why they've had shows on C-SPAN where the Republicans have a celebration for the show 24 with Keither Settle and
[00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.391]  We're good to go.
[00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:42.371]  We're good to go.
[00:25:06.724 --> 00:25:08.405]  One of the highest rated shows.
[00:25:08.405 --> 00:25:13.946]  Sitting there watching it, fantasizing with Jack Bauer, the good guy, torturing.
[00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:26.570]  And men and women all across America, from old ladies down to young black men, are sitting there in their chairs.
[00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.271]  And I've actually been in restaurants when 24's on in Blackfriars, Illinois.
[00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.203]  I mean, we're being mingled.
[00:25:32.203 --> 00:25:33.883]  We're being brought into evil.
[00:25:33.883 --> 00:25:36.464]  And then the neocons write articles about it.
[00:25:36.464 --> 00:25:41.166]  You know, the neocons go, hey, this is really conditioning the public to accept torture.
[00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:46.488]  We're being taken from being somewhat of a moral society right down into total degradation.
[00:25:46.488 --> 00:25:48.369]  And this is all think tank propaganda.
[00:25:48.369 --> 00:25:51.990]  It's been admitted in many of the scripts for major TV shows.
[00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.591]  It's not... I coined the term propaganda placement.
[00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:56.472]  I'm sure you know about product placement.
[00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:58.832]  Where, you know, the movie... Wayne's World.
[00:25:58.832 --> 00:25:59.993]  Gee, Doritos are good!
[00:26:01.063 --> 00:26:09.806]  But instead, this is billboards for the Marine Corps in the background, and statements about how torture's good, and how the Second Amendment's bad.
[00:26:09.806 --> 00:26:14.167]  I mean, there are just so many different stratas, and this is being paid.
[00:26:14.167 --> 00:26:18.648]  And since I mentioned that, perhaps I should go over some evidence of this.
[00:26:18.648 --> 00:26:23.409]  From 2003 into 2004, in those two years, there were billions of dollars spent
[00:26:30.933 --> 00:26:39.155]  If you watch Terror Storm, I say $1.6 billion was spent just on one group of purchases of fake news by the Bush administration.
[00:26:39.155 --> 00:26:42.896]  But now, if you go look it up, you'll also find articles that say $1.8 billion.
[00:26:42.896 --> 00:26:44.117]  That's another thing to see about media.
[00:26:44.117 --> 00:26:47.458]  They can also strawman, because there's always different pieces of data.
[00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:53.399]  And if someone were to pick apart what I said, they'll go find an Armstrong-Williams story and say, no, Bush bought $244,000 of fake news.
[00:26:57.005 --> 00:26:58.505]  You see how that deception works?
[00:26:58.505 --> 00:27:00.666]  But that was only one buy.
[00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:02.526]  You know about the Armstrong Williams case?
[00:27:02.526 --> 00:27:11.649]  The nationally syndicated columnist who was being secretly paid by the White House to go out and push Head Start on the public?
[00:27:11.649 --> 00:27:12.249]  Okay?
[00:27:12.249 --> 00:27:19.591]  That was only one buy of $1.8 billion and those are only a couple programs we know about.
[00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:20.671]  Alright?
[00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:23.432]  And the General Accounting Office
[00:27:27.918 --> 00:27:28.839]  We're good to go.
[00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:58.070]  We're good to go.
[00:28:28.075 --> 00:28:28.715]  We're good to go.
[00:28:54.332 --> 00:28:57.633]  What the people are going to want is what's going to happen to keep us safe.
[00:28:57.633 --> 00:29:03.496]  I'm sad it's got to happen, but we're going to be attacked again, and we're going to have a military form of government in America.
[00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:04.596]  They have these other generals saying it.
[00:29:04.596 --> 00:29:07.617]  I went, that's it!
[00:29:07.617 --> 00:29:09.638]  Automatically, he's on payroll.
[00:29:09.638 --> 00:29:12.119]  He's on payroll, out of the government.
[00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:14.780]  But I didn't go in there with that, but you do this long enough, you just know.
[00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:19.049]  Most of them are on payroll anyways, it's not hard, it's not like shooting fish in a barrel.
[00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:30.434]  And then it came out in several mainstream publications, back of the paper, oh he's getting 500 and something thou a year, funded by the Defense Department for public relations.
[00:29:30.434 --> 00:29:31.495]  It's criminal.
[00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:32.695]  It's illegal.
[00:29:32.695 --> 00:29:34.997]  Tommy Franks is a criminal.
[00:29:34.997 --> 00:29:43.301]  And he's up there on television, on the Defense Department payroll, running around, lying to the public, telling us how great martial law is going to be.
[00:29:44.969 --> 00:29:46.490]  Introducing it to us.
[00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.371]  He didn't come out and say, Martial law is great.
[00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:49.531]  No, no, no.
[00:29:49.531 --> 00:29:54.194]  He did like, you know, Caesar did or any other Roman military man.
[00:29:54.194 --> 00:29:56.695]  Sorry I have to do this before the Republic.
[00:29:56.695 --> 00:29:59.156]  I must become the Supreme Leader.
[00:29:59.156 --> 00:30:03.718]  I mean, you know, I'm sorry, but the military has to take over and run things.
[00:30:03.718 --> 00:30:11.242]  Then you find out there's Rand Corporation documents and it goes back to Nixon and before him and Eisenhower warns you of the
[00:30:11.903 --> 00:30:12.504]  We're good to go.
[00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:51.436]  We're good to go.
[00:31:19.716 --> 00:31:20.756]  Anytime.
[00:31:20.756 --> 00:31:24.497]  You see, they know that you're sophisticated, and to a certain level.
[00:31:24.497 --> 00:31:28.778]  And so they want to trick you with only one level, or two levels, or three levels of the onion.
[00:31:28.778 --> 00:31:32.738]  They want to tell you, oh yeah, there's some bias in the media, it's liberal.
[00:31:32.738 --> 00:31:35.439]  Or it's, there's a conservative media.
[00:31:35.439 --> 00:31:38.439]  But in reality, you've got repeaters.
[00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:42.700]  Almost every major editor of the top 50 newspapers in this country.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.881]  This came out in the hearings in 77, Operation Mockingbird.
[00:31:49.295 --> 00:31:50.216]  We're good.
[00:32:08.524 --> 00:32:12.747]  They head up the media division, and then it's all secret, covert payments.
[00:32:12.747 --> 00:32:13.548]  Okay?
[00:32:13.548 --> 00:32:15.109]  I mean, this goes on everywhere.
[00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:18.291]  You'll have a lot of your big city riders who ride with the police.
[00:32:18.291 --> 00:32:19.872]  They'll actually be a federal man.
[00:32:19.872 --> 00:32:25.957]  They'll be a former DEA, or former CIA, or formerly associated with special forces.
[00:32:25.957 --> 00:32:30.460]  You see, and these people are everywhere, and it's a good old-boy network.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.502]  And so most of your big editors are government.
[00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:36.699]  And it's a good old boy.
[00:32:36.699 --> 00:32:38.300]  They're fellow travelers.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.641]  And so this is how this system works.
[00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:41.822]  And then you've got the pundits.
[00:32:41.822 --> 00:32:44.083]  You've got the people that put out the disinfo.
[00:32:44.083 --> 00:32:53.467]  You've got the, again, you've got the fellow travelers who've already made their bones, shown they have this pro-elite imperial command and control view.
[00:32:53.467 --> 00:32:55.087]  They're put in power positions.
[00:32:55.087 --> 00:33:03.731]  And then under that, you've got all these different CIA operatives and other individuals who are there paying the contracts or hiring the people
[00:33:06.288 --> 00:33:10.930]  Or they'll do things like a major magazine and you look in the magazine and it's mainly defense contractor ads.
[00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:15.752]  Have you ever wondered why Lockheed Martin would be advertising stealth bombers on CNN?
[00:33:15.752 --> 00:33:17.233]  Who are they selling that to?
[00:33:17.233 --> 00:33:23.415]  Or why Archer Daniels Midland for 20 years has had ads all over PBS, CNN, you name it.
[00:33:23.415 --> 00:33:27.097]  Every night where Archer Daniels bringing you, you know, great things.
[00:33:27.097 --> 00:33:34.800]  Well Archer Daniels is involved in all sorts of shady things and it's well known in media circles that is their payment.
[00:33:35.384 --> 00:33:36.044]  To the media.
[00:33:36.044 --> 00:33:40.707]  Their protection money not to get bad reports.
[00:33:40.707 --> 00:33:41.308]  Okay?
[00:33:41.308 --> 00:33:42.329]  All the ads you saw.
[00:33:42.329 --> 00:33:44.470]  Remember that ad you'd see 10, 12 years ago?
[00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:53.536]  Where the space shuttle takes off and the birds take off and you're feeling proud for America and the person points and the camera wheels around and zooms in on the finger and it's biometrically scanned?
[00:33:53.536 --> 00:33:55.877]  Remember seeing that over and over again?
[00:33:55.877 --> 00:33:57.599]  All those ads where it's super bold.
[00:33:57.599 --> 00:34:02.322]  Before the players can come out they do a retina scan right for 9-11 to show they're safe.
[00:34:02.322 --> 00:34:03.522]  Oh look, they're stars.
[00:34:03.522 --> 00:34:04.183]  They get scanned.
[00:34:07.654 --> 00:34:08.354]  We're good to go.
[00:34:37.637 --> 00:34:37.977]  We're good to go.
[00:35:02.065 --> 00:35:02.725]  We're good to go.
[00:35:23.237 --> 00:35:23.857]  The same thing.
[00:35:23.857 --> 00:35:35.159]  Rush Limbaugh comes out and puts out a world view and all the little wannabe neocon talk show hosts regurgitate and copy because their program director tells them that's how you win.
[00:35:35.159 --> 00:35:37.180]  You model yourself after the leader.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.901]  Corporations throw a bunch of money at professors that spew the propaganda they want.
[00:35:40.901 --> 00:35:41.881]  They write textbooks.
[00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:42.901]  They get funded.
[00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:44.501]  They get the chairs.
[00:35:44.501 --> 00:35:47.002]  They get the money they need.
[00:35:47.002 --> 00:35:48.082]  They get the endowments.
[00:35:48.612 --> 00:35:53.056]  They get the research money, and then all the other professors see this theory getting all this funding.
[00:35:53.056 --> 00:35:55.217]  They all start quacking like a bunch of ducks.
[00:35:55.217 --> 00:35:59.881]  They go out and repeat that over and over, and now it's become the dominant nomenclature.
[00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:03.183]  These are all pyramidal structures of control.
[00:36:03.183 --> 00:36:06.906]  That's why the New World Order system symbol is a pyramid.
[00:36:06.906 --> 00:36:15.073]  Up here, they've got all the information, the integrated management systems below them, and then the management systems below that, down to the workers and the general public.
[00:36:16.206 --> 00:36:18.547]  Yes, Orwell wrote, as Eric Blair wrote in 1984, in 1948.
[00:36:18.547 --> 00:36:21.889]  You ought to read that book.
[00:36:21.889 --> 00:36:22.490]  How many of you read it?
[00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.251]  I bet you read it in high school.
[00:36:25.251 --> 00:36:28.733]  The joke is, it's a form of conditioning.
[00:36:28.733 --> 00:36:37.579]  But he wrote, well it's just like in 1984, when O'Brien gets the book delivered to Winston through the Rebels.
[00:36:37.579 --> 00:36:42.942]  And they want him to, and of course that's Orwell, who I believe was a good guy, but he's giving you a full view of it.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:51.504]  So powerful because he worked for the BBC, he worked for the Imperial Police in India, he fought for the Communists and got shot in the neck in Spain.
[00:36:51.504 --> 00:36:52.525]  This guy really lived.
[00:36:52.525 --> 00:36:59.709]  In that book he was saying, in that book the government's bombing itself to keep the control going.
[00:36:59.709 --> 00:37:00.729]  It's all so complex.
[00:37:00.729 --> 00:37:04.111]  The reason I got off into George Orwell was
[00:37:06.837 --> 00:37:10.678]  You know, he basically goes through examples of how the language is being destroyed.
[00:37:10.678 --> 00:37:12.199]  Have you ever tried to read a newspaper from like 1795?
[00:37:12.199 --> 00:37:15.100]  You ever tried to read one?
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.501]  I mean, I got a pretty good vocabulary.
[00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:19.182]  I can't read it.
[00:37:19.182 --> 00:37:23.023]  And they weren't trying to show off that this is how they spoke, that they were intelligent.
[00:37:23.023 --> 00:37:24.604]  Have you tried to read a newspaper from 1850?
[00:37:24.604 --> 00:37:24.764]  Go do it.
[00:37:35.776 --> 00:37:37.898]  I'm oversimplifying, but you know it.
[00:37:37.898 --> 00:37:43.922]  Literally grunting and stooping and totally conditioned, you can't even communicate.
[00:37:43.922 --> 00:37:46.904]  And words mean new things.
[00:37:46.904 --> 00:37:54.530]  You see, they're tearing words apart, shortening them, changing their meanings, where we can't even communicate with each other.
[00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:56.512]  Where you won't be able to communicate with your children.
[00:37:56.512 --> 00:37:58.693]  They go into the education system.
[00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:03.257]  You're so tired when you get home from work that you plop down in front of the TV to go make dinner.
[00:38:03.257 --> 00:38:04.718]  Maybe you read them a book, tell them you love them,
[00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:10.552]  You should go read slave manuals.
[00:38:10.552 --> 00:38:13.573]  Go read slave manuals written in the Caribbean in the 1750s.
[00:38:42.588 --> 00:38:43.329]  We're good to go.
[00:39:09.227 --> 00:39:16.991]  And just in closing, I would really tell you that if you just take action and you have passion and you get involved, you can't be stopped.
[00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:26.477]  And also, one of the biggest tools Madison Avenue uses to control you is making you think you're inadequate and making you think that you don't
[00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:33.031]  We're good to go.
[00:40:07.847 --> 00:40:17.312]  I would just encourage all of you to realize that almost everything you see on television is to make you feel weak and pathetic, man.
[00:40:17.312 --> 00:40:21.453]  And everything you see on television is meant to make women feel inadequate.
[00:40:21.453 --> 00:40:22.854]  Again, it's very simple.
[00:40:22.854 --> 00:40:28.177]  So they can say, but you'll be adequate if you buy this from me.
[00:40:28.177 --> 00:40:30.938]  And to me, that's not a good sales tactic.
[00:40:34.175 --> 00:40:35.296]  It's very, very sick.
[00:40:35.296 --> 00:40:48.265]  And then we get so focused in on the plastic, and the phony, and the Botox, and the collagen injections, and the sports cars, and keeping our cars so clean, that we don't end up spending time with our families.
[00:40:48.265 --> 00:40:53.649]  We don't end up going out playing frisbee, or touch football, or swimming, or hiking, or mountain biking.
[00:40:53.649 --> 00:40:55.850]  We end up not even living.
[00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:59.693]  And we just end up thinking, well, I just had more crap.
[00:40:59.693 --> 00:41:02.215]  If I had more baubles, I would be happy.
[00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:03.892]  And that is such a lie.
[00:41:03.892 --> 00:41:05.112]  That is such a fraud.
[00:41:05.112 --> 00:41:09.975]  And so they've got us chasing after, you know, this carrot and stick.
[00:41:09.975 --> 00:41:11.255]  And it's just not real.
[00:41:11.255 --> 00:41:14.597]  And so number one, feel empowered.
[00:41:14.597 --> 00:41:16.298]  Get involved in the mission.
[00:41:16.298 --> 00:41:17.719]  Have a life calling.
[00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:20.060]  Have a focus.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.762]  And know that every single human being has amazing value.
[00:41:23.762 --> 00:41:26.804]  And know that your life is just going to get better and better as you get older.
[00:41:26.804 --> 00:41:27.564]  That's what I found.
[00:41:27.564 --> 00:41:29.165]  Many of the people I've talked to have found that.
[00:41:29.839 --> 00:41:30.340]  We're good to go.
[00:41:57.794 --> 00:42:01.416]  I'm not really a morning person, but anybody got any questions?
[00:42:01.416 --> 00:42:02.237]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:42:20.756 --> 00:42:30.260]  With this generation, it seems like we've lost the ability to interact with each other and stay in touch with each other without those mechanisms.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:36.323]  And so I was wondering if you might have any suggestion as to how to re-collectivize people.
[00:42:36.323 --> 00:42:43.346]  Because it's creating, kind of like how you were talking about the advertising and the marketing, and it makes you feel inadequate.
[00:42:43.346 --> 00:42:49.669]  This makes you so individualistic that you don't see the potential of collectivism and community.
[00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:54.724]  We're good to go.
[00:43:19.045 --> 00:43:19.905]  You know, self.
[00:43:19.905 --> 00:43:20.746]  Only care about yourself.
[00:43:20.746 --> 00:43:22.727]  Make the world better yourself.
[00:43:22.727 --> 00:43:23.667]  Well, that's delusional.
[00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:24.367]  That's the opposite.
[00:43:24.367 --> 00:43:27.589]  When you get that self-centered, then nobody else cares about you either.
[00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:32.431]  And then you're totally out in the open and can't be defended.
[00:43:32.431 --> 00:43:36.393]  So, I mean, no one is balanced like we should be.
[00:43:36.393 --> 00:43:38.133]  But you need to strive for balance.
[00:43:38.133 --> 00:43:40.635]  And that's why I said spend time on the computer.
[00:43:40.635 --> 00:43:42.435]  Spend time reaching out to people around you.
[00:43:42.435 --> 00:43:43.776]  Spend time in your activism.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.361]  We're good to go.
[00:44:09.124 --> 00:44:10.524]  And I'm just throwing this out there as an idea.
[00:44:10.524 --> 00:44:11.745]  Come up with your own idea.
[00:44:11.745 --> 00:44:15.085]  And 40% of our time when we're socializing on the internet.
[00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:16.986]  And we need to have a MySpace account.
[00:44:16.986 --> 00:44:18.066]  I just started that a few months ago.
[00:44:18.066 --> 00:44:19.366]  I never really promoted it.
[00:44:19.366 --> 00:44:23.107]  I was doing it as a test.
[00:44:23.107 --> 00:44:24.988]  Just a test for MySpace censorship.
[00:44:24.988 --> 00:44:28.008]  There is quite a bit of stuff, our stuff, that gets blocked out on there.
[00:44:28.008 --> 00:44:30.109]  They won't let us post.
[00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:33.190]  It's our original material.
[00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.490]  And I did that as a test.
[00:44:37.315 --> 00:44:37.655]  We're good to go.
[00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:09.809]  There's nothing I love more than seeing the arrogance of those angers of people evaporating as they realize.
[00:45:09.809 --> 00:45:15.332]  I mean, Bill O'Reilly brags about his show, his best show has 3 million viewers.
[00:45:15.332 --> 00:45:17.213]  I mean, folks, that is nothing.
[00:45:17.213 --> 00:45:18.954]  That is absolutely nothing.
[00:45:18.954 --> 00:45:27.718]  I mean, there are websites I know started by 18-year-old young women and men, 18, 20 years old, that are getting a million readers a week.
[00:45:28.652 --> 00:45:29.612]  And it's just growing.
[00:45:29.612 --> 00:45:31.133]  I mean, those guys are dinosaurs.
[00:45:31.133 --> 00:45:32.553]  And I'm not knocking old people.
[00:45:32.553 --> 00:45:34.874]  I got a grandmother, great-grandmother, and my children.
[00:45:34.874 --> 00:45:38.735]  But I mean, literally, folks, he's talking to people who've already lived their lives.
[00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:48.479]  He's talking to people who are just sitting there scared, want to go fishing, and want to go on their vacation, and just want to believe America's still America, and wasn't took by a bunch of foreign criminals.
[00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:49.259]  OK?
[00:45:49.259 --> 00:45:50.959]  And they're just there scared.
[00:45:50.959 --> 00:45:53.340]  And they're just, oh, God, I want my Social Security.
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.501]  They're not going to get it.
[00:45:54.501 --> 00:45:56.661]  That's all being phased out and being shut down.
[00:45:56.661 --> 00:45:57.322]  And it's sad.
[00:45:57.322 --> 00:45:58.302]  We need to be, all of us,
[00:46:03.368 --> 00:46:03.829]  We're good to go.
[00:46:18.865 --> 00:46:19.325]  I think so.
[00:46:45.993 --> 00:46:46.473]  I have a question.
[00:46:46.473 --> 00:46:54.399]  Regarding your criticism of mainstream media, I mean, what would you say about figures like David Icke, who is a famous icon in alternative media?
[00:46:54.399 --> 00:46:56.660]  His idea is that, you know, reptiles, reptile people did 9-11.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.641]  Scientologists blame psychiatrists.
[00:47:16.192 --> 00:47:20.595]  Well, I'm not a follower of David, I'm not a follower of Scientology.
[00:47:20.595 --> 00:47:27.720]  And what David does, that's why I said earlier about alternative media, don't just believe it's alright either.
[00:47:45.592 --> 00:47:46.012]  Don't believe?
[00:47:46.012 --> 00:47:46.833]  I'm telling you the truth.
[00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:47.874]  I want you to go.
[00:47:47.874 --> 00:47:54.439]  As Ronald Reagan would say, one of the few things he said was good, was, uh, was a trust but verify.
[00:47:54.439 --> 00:47:56.361]  And, you know, I've interviewed David many times.
[00:47:56.361 --> 00:47:57.842]  I know David.
[00:47:57.842 --> 00:48:12.334]  And, uh, he, you know, was a big champion goalie and then BBC reporter, uh, announcer, and then he, in the early 90s, got the Christ consciousness thing and said he was the Christ and dressed up in turquoise and went on television.
[00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:14.230]  We're good to go.
[00:48:37.831 --> 00:48:38.652]  We're good to go.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:08.443]  We're good to go.
[00:49:16.359 --> 00:49:24.306]  You said that the editors, the majority of the top 50 newspapers were ex-CIA associated.
[00:49:24.306 --> 00:49:29.070]  According to the 1977 declassified... And that was during the 1970s?
[00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:34.355]  Yeah, and now it's gotten more sophisticated and broken up into other federal agencies.
[00:49:34.355 --> 00:49:43.343]  My question is, how would that benefit the government to expose Watergate when that took away executive power as opposed to increasing executive power?
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:50:00.591]  Well, you see, you bring up the question, in case the mic didn't pick it up, of if the CIA ran, and that's a rough number, it was more than that, but I actually scaled it down because I want you to go look, you're going to find out it's more.
[00:50:00.591 --> 00:50:04.714]  The top 50 editors were on government payroll, many of them CIA.
[00:50:04.714 --> 00:50:07.956]  They came out again in the late 70s, they were on the payroll.
[00:50:07.956 --> 00:50:08.837]  Operation Mockingbird.
[00:50:10.575 --> 00:50:16.620]  And then you said, well, if that's the case, why did they then go after Nixon, which weakened executive power?
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:30.532]  The case is, it was declassified and admitted that the CIA, and I've got stuff going back to the 50s where they're, Kermit Roosevelt's writing to Eisenhower, writing about the CIA's control of the media and their people in the media to plant stories.
[00:50:41.111 --> 00:50:43.373]  We're good to go.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.961]  And he also wasn't playing bald.
[00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:22.543]  Well, he gave interviews to Harper's Magazines and said he didn't like the occultic orgies at Bohemian Grove.
[00:51:22.543 --> 00:51:26.184]  That made him real mad because he wouldn't take part in that.
[00:51:26.184 --> 00:51:26.984]  Go look it up.
[00:51:26.984 --> 00:51:30.064]  There's also an audio file of him talking about it.
[00:51:30.064 --> 00:51:33.885]  The most goddamn faggy thing you've ever seen.
[00:51:33.885 --> 00:51:36.726]  That's a quote from the President.
[00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:39.387]  So he wouldn't do the rituals.
[00:51:39.387 --> 00:51:40.667]  He wouldn't bow to Israel.
[00:51:41.830 --> 00:52:04.691]  He was upset about the transfers of the bomb out of this country and at that point they already had control over the committees in the House and the Senate and so they removed Nixon that way and there's no doubt that Woodward and Bernstein are sophisticated shills.
[00:52:04.691 --> 00:52:08.174]  Certainly Woodward, I don't know about Bernstein, but they're chosen
[00:52:14.206 --> 00:52:25.153]  Have been involved in the Council on Foreign Relations, the Anglo-American ruling British government that was set up here when they failed the League of Nations, since 1922 when it was set up.
[00:52:25.153 --> 00:52:28.175]  Officially in 1922, but it was set up in 1921.
[00:52:28.175 --> 00:52:35.500]  And the Grahams attended every Bilderberg Group meeting since then.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:41.704]  And again, that's where they set the policy, they decided what the policy was going to be every year with the European and U.S.
[00:52:41.704 --> 00:52:42.044]  elites.
[00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:49.596]  And then it's distributed down to their roundtable groups that are the real imperial management governments, or viceroys.
[00:52:49.596 --> 00:52:52.278]  Like the British East India Company managed India.
[00:52:52.278 --> 00:52:53.339]  It's the same system.
[00:52:53.339 --> 00:53:06.792]  The empire learned to take its flag down, okay, and then run up the local flag, and then stick a figurehead out there, and they found that the people, depending on which they even bragged about it, would take four times the abuse on average.
[00:53:06.792 --> 00:53:07.212]  Four times.
[00:53:08.182 --> 00:53:11.863]  Do you think that the government is efficient enough to control us?
[00:53:11.863 --> 00:53:17.904]  It seems like one of the big problems with any government agency is that it's just so inefficient.
[00:53:17.904 --> 00:53:25.506]  How are they able to get their act together enough to... That is one of the most common questions I get.
[00:53:25.506 --> 00:53:29.807]  If the government is so inefficient, how could they carry out 9-11?
[00:53:29.807 --> 00:53:33.108]  Well, how could 19 hijackers command from a cave do it?
[00:53:33.108 --> 00:53:34.128]  But let me expand on that.
[00:53:44.445 --> 00:53:45.947]  We're good to go.
[00:53:59.855 --> 00:54:00.896]  Go look up Tuskegee.
[00:54:00.896 --> 00:54:02.237]  Atomic soldiers.
[00:54:02.237 --> 00:54:03.697]  They took over 10,000 children.
[00:54:03.697 --> 00:54:04.858]  This is even in Newsweek.
[00:54:04.858 --> 00:54:06.079]  They tell you later about it.
[00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:11.182]  And they'd take women and give them bases and they'd say, we're going to give you pills for your baby and vitamins.
[00:54:11.182 --> 00:54:12.663]  They'd be uranium plutonium.
[00:54:12.663 --> 00:54:14.444]  They'd be ready for her to come in and have the miscarriage.
[00:54:14.444 --> 00:54:15.605]  It was for the good of America.
[00:54:15.605 --> 00:54:17.046]  To see what radiation did.
[00:54:17.046 --> 00:54:25.752]  Our government paid equivalent of $3 billion to Israel to radiate 110,000 of their Sephardic children in a race hygiene program.
[00:54:26.532 --> 00:54:29.233]  That went on from the 50s until about 1962.
[00:54:29.233 --> 00:54:32.434]  Many of them died on the spot.
[00:54:32.434 --> 00:54:33.575]  It was called a ringworm show.
[00:54:33.575 --> 00:54:35.395]  They tell them your children want to have the dental work.
[00:54:35.395 --> 00:54:42.698]  You check for ringworms, a common fungus that grows in a circular ring.
[00:54:42.698 --> 00:54:43.378]  So that's what goes on.
[00:54:43.378 --> 00:54:46.099]  They keep all that secret and then later they come out with it.
[00:54:46.099 --> 00:54:50.020]  I can list hundreds of other admitted cases of similar things.
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.881]  They can shoot a cruise missile down your chimney.
[00:54:52.881 --> 00:54:54.462]  They tell you they're inept and they'll be
[00:54:58.786 --> 00:54:59.146]  Bob, you
[00:55:30.692 --> 00:55:31.072]  I have.
[00:55:31.072 --> 00:55:31.513]  Read it.
[00:55:31.513 --> 00:55:32.773]  You need to read him.
[00:55:32.773 --> 00:55:35.275]  Talk about, I went into the elite's files for two years.
[00:55:35.275 --> 00:55:36.015]  We run everything.
[00:55:36.015 --> 00:55:36.716]  We run the commies.
[00:55:36.716 --> 00:55:37.816]  We run the fascists.
[00:55:37.816 --> 00:55:38.657]  We're taking over.
[00:55:38.657 --> 00:55:40.758]  It's British roundtable groups.
[00:55:40.758 --> 00:55:42.519]  Okay, this is how it works.
[00:55:42.519 --> 00:55:44.020]  This is how it operates.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:44.861]  And it's real.
[00:55:44.861 --> 00:55:46.382]  Folks, they brag about it.
[00:55:46.382 --> 00:55:56.988]  Helmut Schmidt, Men in Powers, political retrospective, German Chancellor says, we do rituals in Germany at Groves, but I like the Druidic rituals we do in Northern California at the Bohemian Grove, the thing Nixon didn't like.
[00:55:59.087 --> 00:56:00.568]  We're the Bilderberg Group.
[00:56:00.568 --> 00:56:02.008]  We set the policy for the world.
[00:56:02.008 --> 00:56:04.570]  He wrote it, German Chancellor.
[00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:12.493]  But they know 99.99999999 do not read books like that.
[00:56:12.493 --> 00:56:13.874]  Okay?
[00:56:13.874 --> 00:56:16.515]  They're in control because they are control freaks.
[00:56:16.515 --> 00:56:18.736]  They're sophisticated and they're ruthless.
[00:56:18.736 --> 00:56:21.217]  And they do make mistakes.
[00:56:21.217 --> 00:56:23.558]  Block 93 got shot down, so they didn't make it to its tardy.
[00:56:23.558 --> 00:56:26.840]  You could argue the Capitol, but a lot of people believe Building 7, so they blow it up.
[00:56:27.944 --> 00:56:29.045]  A lot of people go public.
[00:56:29.045 --> 00:56:33.188]  The head of the Defense Language School went public.
[00:56:33.188 --> 00:56:35.249]  And said, those hijackers were trained at our base.
[00:56:35.249 --> 00:56:36.570]  Those are government agents.
[00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:37.951]  Mr. Sprayman, the head of the U.S.
[00:56:37.951 --> 00:56:40.153]  Embassy in Canada, I interviewed him.
[00:56:40.153 --> 00:56:41.954]  Went public and said they had U.S.
[00:56:41.954 --> 00:56:46.117]  security clearance and they were government agents.
[00:56:46.117 --> 00:56:48.879]  It's been in the Canadian papers I've interviewed.
[00:56:48.879 --> 00:56:51.141]  I go on for 600 plus slip-ups they made.
[00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.342]  They're not perfect.
[00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:53.483]  They just know you're simple.
[00:56:53.891 --> 00:56:58.753]  Not because you're stupid, but because you've been taught how to be simple and keep your focus in a limited area with blinders.
[00:56:58.753 --> 00:57:00.894]  Very focused.
[00:57:00.894 --> 00:57:03.616]  And they know it's scary to face the truth.
[00:57:03.616 --> 00:57:05.676]  And the most common other question is, why am I still alive?
[00:57:05.676 --> 00:57:17.582]  That's because there's millions of us speaking out, and millions of us involved, and because we're resisting tyranny on a hundred fronts, and I also believe in God, and I believe that we're doing the right thing, and I know that we're having an effect.
[00:57:18.612 --> 00:57:20.734]  If they kill me, it'll just make me a martyr.
[00:57:20.734 --> 00:57:29.540]  They'll probably, if they ever do something, God forbid, just set me up or do something to me or, you know, I'm found with a heroin needle hanging out of my arm in a hotel room with a whore.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:31.481]  That's the kind of stuff they do, folks.
[00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:32.242]  Okay?
[00:57:32.242 --> 00:57:32.822]  God bless you.
[00:57:32.822 --> 00:57:40.908]  I want to thank your great professor for having me.
[00:57:40.908 --> 00:57:41.648]  Now I'm off.
[00:57:41.648 --> 00:57:42.509]  In 30 minutes I'm on the radio.
