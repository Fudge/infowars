[00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.531]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:08.252]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:10.093]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:11.554]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:13.195]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:17.518]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.181]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:32.829]  I tell ya, with the kick-starting of the whole Charlie Sheen 9-11 controversy and on the heels of that,
[00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:40.452]  The international explosion as Rosie O'Donnell went public with her questions about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:00:41.993 --> 00:00:44.315]  A lot of other news has been coming out surrounding this.
[00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:49.559]  There's been a big hoax out of the Russian newspaper Pravda.
[00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.862]  Now, growing up we were all taught that Pravda put out a lot of disinformation.
[00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:57.345]  And sometimes they put out real info, but sometimes it's total disinfo.
[00:00:58.047 --> 00:01:00.488]  A lot of research has been done over the weekend.
[00:01:00.568 --> 00:01:02.269]  We've known about it for two days.
[00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:11.433]  It's been up for just about three days on Pravda's website saying that Don Imus was going to go public on 9-11 and so that's why he was burned.
[00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:23.719]  Now as soon as I heard that on Saturday and as soon as I went and read the article, my gut level was it was a fraud, number one, because it was Pravda.
[00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.460]  Number two, Don Imus
[00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:37.472]  The last time I saw him a few months ago was saying, just basically kill all the Arabs and nuke them, bomb them, hail Israel, and hail the New World Order.
[00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:44.035]  So I really didn't see him going public on 9-11, so that didn't fit.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:02:02.114]  And then 9-11 blogger and others, a whole horde of investigators descended on the supposed audio files of his show when he supposedly said it, and they're reporting, and they're good at ferreting things out, group team effort, that it is indeed a hoax, which is not surprising.
[00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:09.940]  Drudge has fallen for the hoax, but it is being carried by a major paper, so did he fall for a hoax?
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.801]  In a way, he did.
[00:02:12.184 --> 00:02:15.326]  Because we didn't fall for it, but you know, we've fallen for a couple of hoaxes.
[00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:17.507]  We normally find out about it in a few hours, though.
[00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:19.028]  Drudge has had this up since yesterday.
[00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:24.931]  So, we will go over that article out of Paravda.
[00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:29.173]  Interesting to analyze the anatomy of a hoax.
[00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:35.816]  And then, we'll get into the new Rosie O'Donnell developments.
[00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:41.239]  I was told, well, I've got to take my time on this and be careful about what I say.
[00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.572]  But we can tell you she has obviously been under massive pressure from ABC to shut up.
[00:02:51.552 --> 00:03:03.155]  There is a, quote, neocon producer managing things and trying to rule over with an iron fist, so all the neocons calling for censorship have been having a victory.
[00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:09.157]  And Hot Air, the Michelle Malkin Pentagon operation,
[00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:15.549]  I had a huge celebration yesterday saying, good, she's agreeing to shut up.
[00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.630]  We celebrate this in America now.
[00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:19.751]  Oh, good, she's being stifled.
[00:03:20.392 --> 00:03:21.692]  Oh, we'll sleep better at night.
[00:03:21.892 --> 00:03:23.593]  Oh, our Pentagon Office is working well.
[00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:30.556]  This is from a person who writes books in defense of camps and says everybody needs to be put in concentration camps.
[00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:37.179]  She just fits in nicely with John Yoo, who writes memos up saying they can torture children.
[00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.182]  Or Alberto Gonzales saying Bush is the king.
[00:03:40.582 --> 00:03:41.523]  Literally, it says that.
[00:03:42.023 --> 00:03:51.171]  And then a top Princeton law expert, Marine Corps colonel, and a conservative gives a speech saying the President is not above the Congress and the people.
[00:03:52.112 --> 00:03:53.435]  Uh, and he's on a no-fly list.
[00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:56.260]  I mean, that's who we're dealing with here.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.143]  Do you understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:03:58.403 --> 00:04:02.410]  America is the Bill of Rights and Constitution, the Spirit of Liberty, the Declaration of Independence.
[00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:04.374]  If we don't have that, we're just more dirt.
[00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:24.849]  And it is despicable, and I've had enough of Michelle Malkin, and Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity, and Rush Limbaugh, and Neil Bortz, and all of this un-American filth, wrapping themselves in the flag, and in the dead troops' names, and the dead firemen's names, and the dead policemen's names, when their bosses blew those buildings to kingdom come!
[00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:34.617]  And you call for camps, and my arrest, and Fetcher's arrest, and Mark Cuban's arrest, and Charlie Sheen's
[00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:37.599]  He needs to be run out and he better watch it.
[00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.640]  Listen to me, you traitorous trash.
[00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:42.261]  We're not going to stop.
[00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:43.182]  Do you understand that?
[00:04:43.502 --> 00:04:44.622]  Defending this republic.
[00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:46.603]  We actually love this country.
[00:04:47.063 --> 00:04:47.964]  And we're going to beat you.
[00:04:47.984 --> 00:04:50.625]  Alright, we're going to come back and get into all of it.
[00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:51.646]  The Pravda hoax.
[00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:55.207]  Rosie O'Donnell, is she really being cowed?
[00:04:55.227 --> 00:04:56.588]  We told you there would be news on Monday.
[00:04:57.428 --> 00:04:58.609]  That's not the info we're getting.
[00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:10.191]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:18.183]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.877 --> 00:05:25.942]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.343 --> 00:05:37.751]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.534]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:42.034 --> 00:05:43.976]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.316 --> 00:05:48.159]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:11.594]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.014 --> 00:06:12.855]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.175 --> 00:06:17.718]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:20.340]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.721]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:25.843]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.

[00:07:01.323 --> 00:07:05.584]  Are you fed up with all the side effects and chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:10.725]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:10.945 --> 00:07:12.286]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:15.946]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:07:36.237 --> 00:07:37.178]  No animal testing.

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.361]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.

[00:08:01.777 --> 00:08:07.340]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:39.539]  For those of you just joining us, I've had to basically gag myself, you know, tie myself up for the last two weeks knowing what's going on behind the scenes with Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:53.964]  And I still don't want to talk about too much and endanger her position at The View and give any fodder to those that want to have her removed, but we will be walking through that.
[00:08:55.015 --> 00:09:00.018]  There is a story up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:09:00.819 --> 00:09:04.981]  Rosie prepares to strike back for 9-1-1 truth.
[00:09:05.121 --> 00:09:06.042]  Insider scoop.
[00:09:06.502 --> 00:09:13.587]  Ground Zero heroes impacted by toxic dust cover up to appear on The View Tuesday.
[00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:15.608]  Now I learned this over the weekend.
[00:09:16.303 --> 00:09:19.425]  And that's what she was trying to schedule, either today or tomorrow.
[00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:22.948]  So if they were there live today, it'll be on tomorrow.
[00:09:23.448 --> 00:09:25.469]  If it's done on Tuesday, it'll be on Wednesday.
[00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.251]  And that's if she's able to do it.
[00:09:27.311 --> 00:09:38.699]  But that's what she's shooting for, and I have... I mean, I have Rosie O'Donnell's email, I have her comments, I have very incendiary things she's said about Tom DeLay.
[00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:43.342]  We can't get into that because we don't want to endanger Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:44.603]  I've also talked to
[00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:49.208]  Two people deep inside her camp, good friends of hers.
[00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:54.774]  One friend who just went on vacation with her last week to Florida, to Miami.
[00:09:57.276 --> 00:10:01.501]  And we also, of course, have a prominent 9-11 truther.
[00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:08.888]  An extremely prominent 9-11 truther who has been advising her and talking with her since before she went public.
[00:10:09.765 --> 00:10:11.866]  And I know this person very, very well.
[00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:14.566]  You know him very, very well.
[00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.787]  I'm not going to say who it is until later.
[00:10:20.768 --> 00:10:22.129]  I don't know, maybe you can make a guess.
[00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:27.610]  But we will have that individual on very soon, don't worry.
[00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.891]  And he will be able to tell you, hopefully, fully what's going on.
[00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:34.172]  But I will walk through it.
[00:10:40.262 --> 00:10:48.868]  Now, I think I should just go ahead and get into the rosy thing now.
[00:10:53.892 --> 00:10:59.216]  Or perhaps I should get into the Pravda story first.
[00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:06.401]  The big hoax that so many people have bitten into and taken hold of.
[00:11:08.954 --> 00:11:23.853]  Now, for those that haven't heard about it, the report is that Don Imush was going to go public on 9-11 truth.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:44.668]  And that because he was going to go public on 9-11 Truth and had threatened them to go public on 9-11 Truth, that they basically took a statement, the type of statement, that he routinely made and blew it way out of proportion.
[00:11:45.248 --> 00:11:47.689]  I'm not going to debate the whole Don Imus firing here.
[00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:49.029]  That's all anybody's talking about.
[00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.451]  They're trying to stage World War III with Iran right now.
[00:11:53.403 --> 00:11:55.905]  The globalists are plunging the dollar as we speak.
[00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:58.346]  I'm freaking out financially.
[00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:08.792]  I mean, just watching my meager savings evaporate into nothing, into dust, and the general public out there in America has no idea even what that means to have a currency devaluation.
[00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:10.133]  You're going to find out, America, by the way.
[00:12:12.114 --> 00:12:13.816]  All these serious things are happening.
[00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:17.258]  More and more evidence of exactly what's killing the honeybees is coming out.
[00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:22.581]  More and more evidence that GMO pollen is what's causing massive record allergy
[00:12:23.566 --> 00:12:24.867]  Spikes across the nation.
[00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:29.110]  I've got all this incredibly important news.
[00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.353]  They're trying to force live cancer virus inoculations on our girls.
[00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:35.275]  Now they want to give it to our boys.
[00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:42.380]  I've got wall-to-wall news about bombings in the Green Zone and the occupation.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.102]  It could fall, things are getting so bad.
[00:12:45.122 --> 00:12:47.524]  The Guard is now about to be called up to 100%
[00:12:51.067 --> 00:12:57.953]  It's an orgy of important news, but I think we'll just get into 9-11 first here today.
[00:12:59.754 --> 00:13:02.096]  And by the way, we're going to have wide open phones as well.
[00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:03.397]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:03.457]  800-259-9231.
[00:13:03.477 --> 00:13:05.279]  Paul's doing a little blurb about this hoax.
[00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:13.045]  No one seems to really report it on the fact that it's a hoax, other than a few little 9-11 sites that are doing a great job.
[00:13:21.118 --> 00:13:22.099]  They've done some research.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:31.350]  In a clear sign, but let's go ahead first and get into this Pravda article, because it's important.
[00:13:32.391 --> 00:13:38.478]  American radio icon Don Imus disgraced, fired after threat to reveal 9-11 secrets.
[00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:49.923]  In a clear sign of its intent to rein in dissident American media personalities and their growing influence in American culture, U.S.
[00:13:50.003 --> 00:14:05.011]  war leaders this past week launched an unprecedented attack upon one of their most politically connected and legendary radio hosts named Don Imus after his threats to release information relating to the September 11, 2001 attacks upon that country.
[00:14:07.912 --> 00:14:14.527]  According to European reports of the events surrounding Don Imus that have gripped the United States this past week.
[00:14:15.209 --> 00:14:17.855]  And when they say according to European reports, they give no link to that.
[00:14:18.562 --> 00:14:20.263]  That's a good sign of a hoax right there.
[00:14:20.843 --> 00:14:28.206]  It was during an interview with another American media personality, Tim Russert, who is the host of a television program frequently used by U.S.
[00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:36.790]  war leaders, wherein, while decrying the state of care being given to American war wounded, stated, so those bastards want to keep the boys, in reference to U.S.
[00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:41.272]  soldiers, secret with their medical treatment.
[00:14:41.813 --> 00:14:44.914]  Let's see how they like it if I start talking about
[00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:46.089]  We're good to go.
[00:15:04.142 --> 00:15:08.505]  A pack of 9-11 researchers literally descended on it, and it's just not there.
[00:15:08.766 --> 00:15:10.567]  Of course, again, it's Pravda.
[00:15:10.627 --> 00:15:14.671]  It's the joke from the 60s and 70s and 80s of, oh, where'd you read that?
[00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:15.932]  In Pravda?
[00:15:17.413 --> 00:15:19.415]  Now, they've shaked up a lot in the last 10 years.
[00:15:19.455 --> 00:15:20.976]  I mean, I've read a lot of stuff in there that's true.
[00:15:21.056 --> 00:15:27.002]  But I'm always, every few months, there's some total piece of not even yellow journalism.
[00:15:27.042 --> 00:15:30.505]  I mean, this is just completely pulled out of their
[00:15:32.736 --> 00:15:34.338]  Well, it's completely just pulled out of a hat.
[00:15:34.358 --> 00:15:35.619]  Okay, I'll say it that way.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.202]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:15:39.785 --> 00:15:45.012]  Unable to attack such a powerful media figure as Don Imus directly, the U.S.
[00:15:45.072 --> 00:15:48.477]  war leaders, and as we have seen many times before, reported
[00:15:49.221 --> 00:16:04.186]  And resorted to a massive media attack against him using a racial slur against a woman's basketball team, but which has been pointed out by other media outlets was not by any means a rare occurrence for the legendary radio icon to make.
[00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.611]  But, to the U.S.
[00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:25.777]  war leaders, Don Imus represented the most serious threat to date of the growing assault against them by American media personalities threatening to expose the truths behind the events of September 11, 2001, and the Iraq-Afghanistan wars, and to such an extent that another American media personality, Rosie O'Donnell, has expressed concerns that the U.S.
[00:16:25.797 --> 00:16:29.698]  military leaders could actually imprison Mr. Imus.
[00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:37.498]  Well, what she said was, is the thought police are coming and that she doesn't like what he said, but she supports his free speech.
[00:16:37.918 --> 00:16:39.661]  And she's always had that free speech position.
[00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:44.107]  She's been talking about 1984, she's been talking about Big Brother and Winston Smith.
[00:16:44.127 --> 00:16:46.230]  I mean, she's really had her paradigm shifted.
[00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:48.293]  We'll get into that a little bit later.
[00:16:50.498 --> 00:17:05.603]  For our past research of the tactics used against those threatening America's war leaders, the likelihood of imprisonment for Don Imus would only occur should he persist in his threats to undermine their authority, and which appears at this time unlikely after the public disgrace he has had to endure.
[00:17:06.223 --> 00:17:07.724]  It is expected also that U.S.
[00:17:07.764 --> 00:17:16.386]  war leaders' actions against Don Imus will have a further chilling effect upon other American media personalities questioning their authority, such as the popular U.S.
[00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:18.227]  movie actor Charlie Sheen,
[00:17:19.771 --> 00:17:23.114]  And it was one of the first to question the events of September 11th.
[00:17:23.874 --> 00:17:25.035]  And then it just goes on.
[00:17:28.097 --> 00:17:35.263]  So they mix in a lot of truth with what I can only call complete and total lies.
[00:17:36.384 --> 00:17:45.991]  And this was put together by a Sorka Fall, as reported to the Western subscribers.
[00:17:48.715 --> 00:17:49.836]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:17:49.896 --> 00:17:51.296]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.237]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:53.617 --> 00:17:55.218]  It's up on JonesReport.com.
[00:17:55.898 --> 00:17:58.139]  It's up on InfoWars.net if you want to go read the hoax.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:06.563]  And there'll be, again, an article coming out in the next 20 minutes or so up on PrisonPlanet.com dealing with this hoax.
[00:18:06.783 --> 00:18:12.786]  And I'm sure Paul will make the same points, but the three key points are it's probed
[00:18:14.742 --> 00:18:19.966]  Number two, they don't give a link to what European sources said that Imus was saying this or doing this.
[00:18:20.787 --> 00:18:39.260]  When we've done exhaustive searches off and on for two plus days, this came out on Friday by the way, we've been doing exhaustive research and there is no European press saying this, there is no European press doing this, and it's just completely made up.
[00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:43.904]  And then of course thirdly, Don Imus was a neocon warmonger
[00:18:44.978 --> 00:18:53.961]  Uh, who had been, you know, lots of parking lot, glass parking lot comments about the Middle East and Central Asia and lots of just kill all the Palestinian, uh, comments.
[00:18:55.581 --> 00:19:00.323]  So, and then they tried to claim that he was going to meet with that New Jersey governor.
[00:19:00.343 --> 00:19:12.747]  I haven't been able to find proof of that and then on his way to meeting the New Jersey governor got run over in about a hit and run out of millions of people in that, uh, city and that
[00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.991]  That was a message, I mean, give me a break.
[00:19:18.351 --> 00:19:19.792]  And it just spins out of control.
[00:19:20.172 --> 00:19:25.674]  And now, guaranteed, I'll get an email in a week or a month, or it'll be in some of the message boards right now, I saw it.
[00:19:26.994 --> 00:19:28.095]  Hey, look at these kooks.
[00:19:28.975 --> 00:19:31.456]  Oh yeah, and I bet Charlie, she never really said it either.
[00:19:31.476 --> 00:19:43.480]  Or I bet, you know, they're gonna get him, it's just, they mix in all this bull with real stuff that's going on, and it just discredits the whole.
[00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.830]  Their favorite tactic.
[00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:50.872]  And for months I'll have people calling in and emailing me, did you hear about Don Imus?
[00:19:51.272 --> 00:19:52.833]  He was going to go public on 9-11.
[00:19:53.353 --> 00:19:55.734]  There's about a 1% chance this is accurate.
[00:19:56.394 --> 00:19:58.755]  There's about a 1% chance, maybe 1% chance this is accurate.
[00:20:03.542 --> 00:20:08.086]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:08.406 --> 00:20:12.490]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:13.331]  We listened.
[00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:18.616]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.896 --> 00:20:19.396]  We listened.
[00:20:19.777 --> 00:20:22.799]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.780]  We listened.
[00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:27.804]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:27.944 --> 00:20:28.745]  We're good to go.
[00:20:44.648 --> 00:20:47.290]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.

[00:20:50.752 --> 00:20:52.653]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:07.671 --> 00:21:12.514]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:12.714 --> 00:21:15.456]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:15.496 --> 00:21:16.596]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:17.957 --> 00:21:22.560]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:30.745]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:31.745 --> 00:21:34.787]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.404]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:41.365 --> 00:21:42.646]  Call for your copy today.

[00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:52.016]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:52.716 --> 00:21:52.997]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.017 --> 00:21:53.337]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.716 --> 00:22:03.758]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.379 --> 00:22:13.309]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:20.958]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:27.172]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:22:47.782 --> 00:22:48.963]  We're good to go.
[00:23:10.948 --> 00:23:14.111]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:18.035]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[00:23:18.315 --> 00:23:26.263]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.
[00:23:26.643 --> 00:23:32.949]  Get two Witness Ministries' next shocking revelation, The Rider of the White Horse, George W. Bush in Prophecy.
[00:23:33.249 --> 00:23:34.070]  Visit the website.
[00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:34.951]  We're good to go.
[00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:21.503]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:21.624 --> 00:24:22.944]  until 2 p.m.
[00:24:23.005 --> 00:24:34.773]  Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight on the birds here at the Genesis Network and then of course you can listen 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com as the show ends every day at 2 p.m.
[00:24:34.813 --> 00:24:37.255]  Central it just re-streams on the internet
[00:24:38.067 --> 00:24:44.471]  And we have a free daily podcast you can go subscribe to at InfoWars.com and help us get the word out about this.
[00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:46.252]  Tens of thousands of people are using it.
[00:24:47.113 --> 00:24:50.895]  But frankly, we want a lot more to become aware of the fact you just subscribe to it.
[00:24:50.955 --> 00:24:58.320]  You click subscribe, it automatically downloads every day into your MP3 or iPod or video pod.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.382]  You still listen to audio on most of those systems.
[00:25:01.262 --> 00:25:04.084]  And as you know, I don't know why I'm explaining that to people, but
[00:25:05.535 --> 00:25:10.038]  It's just a great system and it's free and you just subscribe to it.
[00:25:10.579 --> 00:25:16.403]  If you don't have an iPod or you don't have a system like that, you're not a big computer person.
[00:25:16.743 --> 00:25:20.326]  They are very easy to use and I just love my iPods.
[00:25:20.366 --> 00:25:23.428]  It's one of the few things, one of the few possessions I actually like.
[00:25:23.448 --> 00:25:25.489]  I think I've got like four of them, five of them.
[00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.991]  Going back a few years, different models of them.
[00:25:30.052 --> 00:25:34.455]  But you do want to keep your, what's it called?
[00:25:35.845 --> 00:25:42.907]  Policy on it because they want one iPod might last two years another might break in a month They're delicate.
[00:25:43.407 --> 00:25:44.628]  Well, I wouldn't call them delicate.
[00:25:44.648 --> 00:25:53.910]  I guess you do beat them up and use them and drop them and but My point is now this is not a computer show and I'm not even a tech savvy person.
[00:25:53.930 --> 00:26:01.072]  I'm already digressing off and picturing little iPods With music and audio and books on tape.
[00:26:01.132 --> 00:26:02.993]  I just love them free
[00:26:04.136 --> 00:26:14.379]  Podcasts of the three-hour show every day listen how you want when you want where you want at Infowars.com Okay, I'm done talking about Pravda
[00:26:15.414 --> 00:26:17.336]  And I'm going to start getting into this now.
[00:26:17.416 --> 00:26:19.277]  When I get back from the break, I will detail it.
[00:26:19.317 --> 00:26:26.742]  And I guess reading over this article, I was thinking this morning, there's a little bit more I can reveal as well that's not just in this article, that we can have it added to the article.
[00:26:27.162 --> 00:26:29.224]  And it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:30.825]  It is a very important story.
[00:26:31.225 --> 00:26:34.688]  Rosie has been silent on 9-11 for about two and a half weeks.
[00:26:35.448 --> 00:26:41.673]  National Firestorms still have all the big national talk show hosts, neocons, beating the drum from CNN to Fox.
[00:26:42.515 --> 00:26:46.137]  To Bill O'Reilly on radio that she should be fired.
[00:26:46.197 --> 00:26:47.758]  Everybody should be arrested basically.
[00:26:48.578 --> 00:26:59.104]  And we can now reveal what Rosie is at least telling her confidants in email and in person and what she's relaying to friends and family that she is planning to do.
[00:26:59.164 --> 00:27:00.985]  I mean, I have this confirmed in triplicate.
[00:27:01.945 --> 00:27:05.607]  Rosie prepares to strike back for 9-11 truth.
[00:27:06.007 --> 00:27:08.949]  That is the headline on InfoWars.com and PrisonPundit.com right now.
[00:27:10.302 --> 00:27:12.663]  Rosie prepares to strike back for 9-11 Truth.
[00:27:12.863 --> 00:27:13.963]  Insider scoop.
[00:27:14.923 --> 00:27:24.667]  Ground Zero heroes impacted by toxic dust cover up to appear on The View Tuesday.
[00:27:25.387 --> 00:27:26.927]  That's what I was told over the weekend.
[00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:30.808]  That directly from Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:27:31.189 --> 00:27:33.269]  But we'll see if that indeed happens.
[00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:35.030]  That is directly from Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:35.910]  I have it in writing.
[00:27:39.105 --> 00:27:39.746]  It continues.
[00:27:39.826 --> 00:28:02.988]  Contradicting reports that Rosie O'Donnell is set to cease her vocal stance against the Bush administration and the 9-11 cover-up, we can exclusively reveal that Rosie is preparing to strike back by featuring interviews of 9-11 heroes and first responders themselves, victims of a government cover-up that allowed them to breathe deadly toxic dust at ground zero.
[00:28:04.404 --> 00:28:11.206]  A headline on the Drudge Report today reads, Rosie No More Impeach Bush Talk On The View Over.
[00:28:12.146 --> 00:28:27.571]  And it's a big Drudge headline, along with the other hoax that he's got up there, that Donna got fired over 9-11, which suggests O'Donnell is backing down from her controversial comments that led top neocon free speech haters to call for her dismissal.
[00:28:28.131 --> 00:28:31.852]  The story links to Rosie's blog, in which she, quote, promises to
[00:28:33.388 --> 00:28:37.631]  Talk about other things, and she just has a rambling face.
[00:28:37.651 --> 00:28:41.875]  She goes, well, I'll be talking about other things this week than what I was, and I'll just be screaming inside.
[00:28:43.476 --> 00:28:47.139]  And I guess that does, you could interpret that, that she's going to be backing off.
[00:28:47.839 --> 00:28:57.127]  We know now that other things include the government's criminal cover-up of the Ground Zero toxic dust scandal that is now killing 9-11 heroes in large numbers.
[00:28:57.387 --> 00:28:59.649]  And we should add, she's got to get it passed
[00:29:00.325 --> 00:29:03.368]  A neocon producer who is a gatekeeper.
[00:29:03.748 --> 00:29:05.089]  So, again, that's key.
[00:29:05.129 --> 00:29:06.410]  She has gone through pressure.
[00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.131]  Rosie has been pressured.
[00:29:09.392 --> 00:29:20.081]  There is a neocon gatekeeper and she did reveal to us that there has been a lot of freaking out at the show and a lot of, quote, steel dealing with what she said in the past weeks.
[00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:23.023]  And she makes millions of dollars a year off this show, folks.
[00:29:23.043 --> 00:29:24.224]  She's putting all that in danger.
[00:29:25.125 --> 00:29:29.448]  Again, she does some things that are silly and ignorant in the past, but she's got guts and guts is enough.
[00:29:30.231 --> 00:29:33.953]  We'll come back, continue with this article, and cover a little bit more as well.
[00:29:33.973 --> 00:29:36.574]  And we'll take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:36.614 --> 00:29:46.079]  And I do know that we have a lot of callers that are already patiently holding, like Richard, John, Richard, Chris, Zach, and many others.
[00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.399]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:33:36.735 --> 00:33:40.537]  That's right, and he's at Virginia Tech.
[00:33:40.637 --> 00:33:45.640]  They're reporting at least 20 people dead.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.581]  They were saying 21.
[00:33:48.021 --> 00:33:49.602]  This just broke in the last 10 minutes.
[00:33:50.623 --> 00:33:56.446]  First they said that 9 people had been shot and wounded.
[00:33:56.486 --> 00:33:58.087]  Now then they said 21 dead.
[00:33:58.507 --> 00:33:59.227]  Fatalities.
[00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:00.768]  Now they're saying 20 dead.
[00:34:00.828 --> 00:34:02.109]  Who knows what the real numbers are.
[00:34:03.366 --> 00:34:09.929]  In every case, the guy in the 80s going to the McDonald's and killing 30-something people turned out definite government op.
[00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:12.771]  We know that Columbine was a government op.
[00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:16.512]  We know that the kid up in Minnesota was a government op.
[00:34:16.873 --> 00:34:18.333]  It's always the same MO.
[00:34:18.753 --> 00:34:20.995]  They're always with weird government psychiatrists.
[00:34:21.315 --> 00:34:22.695]  They're always on Prozac.
[00:34:23.556 --> 00:34:26.137]  Let's get a report out on this right now at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:26.157 --> 00:34:30.119]  They're always on some serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:34:33.035 --> 00:34:39.101]  In Tasmania, the famous shooting that got guns basically pretty much banned over there, where he killed 20-something people.
[00:34:39.481 --> 00:34:44.286]  He'd been in a government mine control facility connected to the Tavistock Institute.
[00:34:44.326 --> 00:34:45.187]  I mean, it was incredible.
[00:34:46.088 --> 00:34:57.419]  Now, the guy that shot John Lennon, of course, had been involved with World Vision, the big Christian CIA front group that has these brainwashing camps overseas and refugee centers.
[00:34:58.512 --> 00:35:02.595]  The guy that shot Reagan's dad headed that up, and he'd also been at one of those camps.
[00:35:02.955 --> 00:35:04.556]  I mean, over and over, the shooters come from there.
[00:35:05.357 --> 00:35:08.799]  In every case, so look for him to be on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:26.490]  Now, if he isn't a government mind control operative, and this is real, folks, this is documented in congressional testimony, that these people exist, like Sirhan, Sirhan, all of it, with Bobby Kennedy and the rest of it, woman in the polka dot dress, all of it,
[00:35:27.737 --> 00:35:31.901]  If it isn't that, it's video games.
[00:35:32.442 --> 00:35:40.130]  Because it creates instinctive shooting, that's why it was created for the military, and how to continually shoot, and how to continually move on and shoot more targets.
[00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.372]  And I've been looking for a hundred to get killed.
[00:35:42.792 --> 00:35:48.779]  They're going to have the right kind of mind control operative, who they've already been training since childhood,
[00:35:50.021 --> 00:35:51.842]  Also, I'll be a big video game fan.
[00:35:51.862 --> 00:35:53.644]  That'll keep them kind of in the program.
[00:35:54.064 --> 00:35:55.965]  It's actually a Pentagon programming tool.
[00:35:56.005 --> 00:35:56.626]  They developed it.
[00:35:57.326 --> 00:35:58.327]  Doom and such games.
[00:35:58.887 --> 00:36:00.789]  And they'll probably kill a hundred.
[00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:01.489]  It could be two hundred.
[00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:03.290]  What they'll do is they'll lock a school down.
[00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.712]  Because when the guy goes in now, they lock them down.
[00:36:05.772 --> 00:36:06.933]  So you can't get out.
[00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:07.994]  You're just like, ahhhhhh!
[00:36:08.274 --> 00:36:10.415]  And they're just, you know, like a Terminator.
[00:36:10.455 --> 00:36:16.199]  You know, you can hear the music in the background.
[00:36:18.542 --> 00:36:20.223]  This is absolutely disgusting, but look.
[00:36:21.745 --> 00:36:24.647]  Hundreds of thousands get killed every year in car accidents.
[00:36:25.267 --> 00:36:26.648]  Thousands get struck by lightning.
[00:36:27.609 --> 00:36:37.317]  I haven't checked in the World Almanac in years, but shooting deaths themselves is like 14th, sometimes it's 12th, sometimes it's 15th, but it's been, you know, those different numbers every year.
[00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:41.980]  Children have a much better chance of drowning in mop buckets.
[00:36:42.561 --> 00:36:45.063]  Children have a better chance of dying in high school sports.
[00:36:45.243 --> 00:36:46.304]  You know, that's official numbers.
[00:36:46.912 --> 00:36:48.173]  Now some years guns are more.
[00:36:48.213 --> 00:36:49.153]  There's some big shooting.
[00:36:49.413 --> 00:36:50.334]  That year it'll be more.
[00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:59.658]  But on average, high school sports, rugby, football, even baseball kills more people.
[00:36:59.698 --> 00:36:59.938]  I don't know.
[00:36:59.978 --> 00:37:03.679]  One time I hit a baseball and it went right into a kid's head and just like basically knocked his eye out.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.201]  It was like almost blinded him.
[00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:07.621]  He was able to see.
[00:37:07.661 --> 00:37:09.742]  They were able to fix the eye but didn't mean it.
[00:37:09.782 --> 00:37:11.643]  I mean I hit the ball and right into his face.
[00:37:13.756 --> 00:37:16.937]  And I guess they didn't, you know, I was more like 10 years old, but I slugged it.
[00:37:18.938 --> 00:37:26.740]  That's the kind of stuff that, and it was a softball actually, it's not very soft, but that's the type of thing that goes on.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:36.724]  Doesn't matter, there's going to be hysteria endlessly, the Democrats now are going to launch, even Rush Limbaugh years ago would say, why is it every time they introduce legislation this happens?
[00:37:37.064 --> 00:37:40.645]  They got their assault weapons ban shot down, Bush was very angry about that,
[00:37:41.645 --> 00:37:58.298]  And there'll be a new reign of terror against the Second Amendment, despite the fact that these things are always suspicious, they're always on government, push drugs, and all these other statistics show that you have a better chance of, again, grounding that you do, than dying from a gun.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.701]  Dying from a shooter.
[00:38:02.601 --> 00:38:08.626]  If you average in suicides, and people are going to do that regardless, then it would be higher than grounding.
[00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:15.634]  But your chances of being shot, and by the way, they average in people getting shot, gangbangers killing each other.
[00:38:15.694 --> 00:38:16.615]  That's averaged in.
[00:38:17.436 --> 00:38:25.563]  And the lion's share of that is gangbanger fights from Detroit to Dallas to Houston to Los Angeles to New York to Chicago.
[00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:28.166]  Here's the report right now.
[00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:31.529]  At least one dead, others injured in Virginia Tech shooting.
[00:38:31.569 --> 00:38:34.752]  Now again, the AP and others are going to be behind.
[00:38:35.902 --> 00:38:37.763]  Okay, this is twenty minutes old.
[00:38:38.483 --> 00:38:52.250]  Ten minutes ago, less than ten minutes ago, about five minutes ago when I was watching CNN, they were reporting that, and they're just going to keep reporting it, that first it was twenty-one dead, now they're saying twenty dead.
[00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.532]  I wonder if the SWAT team sat outside forever.
[00:38:55.552 --> 00:38:56.653]  Doesn't sound like it.
[00:38:56.673 --> 00:38:58.053]  We've already heard about this on the news.
[00:38:58.914 --> 00:39:01.615]  The chief is saying at least twenty dead in campus shootings.
[00:39:02.076 --> 00:39:04.617]  The Virginia Tech police chief said at least twenty dead.
[00:39:05.313 --> 00:39:10.256]  20 people were killed in twin shootings on the Blacksburg campus Monday morning.
[00:39:10.977 --> 00:39:12.098]  Twin shootings!
[00:39:12.858 --> 00:39:13.278]  Twin!
[00:39:13.298 --> 00:39:15.840]  This is getting... This is... Oh my God.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.141]  Some victims were shot in the classroom.
[00:39:18.582 --> 00:39:24.205]  Chief Wendell Fincham said... Remember the Beltway snipers?
[00:39:25.026 --> 00:39:25.887]  Remember all those other ops?
[00:39:25.927 --> 00:39:29.789]  Remember the Maryland snipers?
[00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:30.149]  The D.C.
[00:39:30.209 --> 00:39:30.650]  snipers?
[00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.231]  Remember all that?
[00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:33.892]  Total black ops, folks.
[00:39:34.625 --> 00:39:36.146]  Total government operation.
[00:39:37.067 --> 00:39:39.249]  I mean, that thing, I could talk for hours about that.
[00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:41.231]  I mean, that was just a classic M.O.
[00:39:42.071 --> 00:39:44.573]  He really had other shooters that witnesses kept seeing.
[00:39:44.633 --> 00:39:47.916]  White guys in white vans, and you grab your mental patient patsies.
[00:39:49.357 --> 00:39:51.579]  Some victims were shot in the classroom.
[00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:59.706]  Chief Wendell Fincham said, adding that the gunman was dead, President Charles Steiger called the shootings a tragedy of monumental proportions.
[00:40:00.678 --> 00:40:06.620]  A hospital spokesman told the Associated Press that 17 Virginia Tech students were being treated for gunshot wounds and other injuries.
[00:40:06.861 --> 00:40:13.083]  And now they're just going to turn that campus into a total police state with metal detectors and guards everywhere and you'll pay more tuition for it.
[00:40:13.503 --> 00:40:16.204]  And then when there is another shooting, the guards will run off and hide.
[00:40:16.464 --> 00:40:18.065]  They've got armed guards up in Minnesota.
[00:40:18.225 --> 00:40:19.826]  They've got armed guards in a bunch of these shootings.
[00:40:20.366 --> 00:40:21.406]  And they run and cower.
[00:40:21.426 --> 00:40:22.647]  Usually they're not even armed.
[00:40:24.728 --> 00:40:27.009]  SWAT teams, four hours, fifteen minutes at Columbine.
[00:40:27.029 --> 00:40:29.070]  Everybody bled to death because they needed a higher death toll.
[00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:30.950]  All those big bombs didn't go off.
[00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.911]  The hundred plus bombs, those two guys supposedly brought in.
[00:40:34.411 --> 00:40:36.832]  The armed security all pulled back and went to have lunch.
[00:40:37.973 --> 00:40:39.093]  Totally staged, folks.
[00:40:39.593 --> 00:40:40.433]  Totally staged.
[00:40:41.094 --> 00:40:47.236]  So there was a little bit of upset there with the commanders that they hadn't gotten their full death toll that was supposedly going to be in the hundreds.
[00:40:47.656 --> 00:40:49.316]  Over half the school didn't show up that day.
[00:40:49.336 --> 00:40:50.777]  It was so known what was going to happen.
[00:40:51.157 --> 00:40:53.938]  You know, black ops don't always go like you want them to, do they?
[00:40:54.827 --> 00:40:59.188]  And so you had to wait four hours and 15 minutes to make sure everybody bled to death.
[00:40:59.588 --> 00:41:03.109]  It's admitted that the SWAT team shot at least two of the students trying to exit.
[00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:08.250]  And the other students reported other men in black masks actually doing the shootings.
[00:41:09.931 --> 00:41:16.692]  One person, back to this, a hospital spokeswoman told the Associated Press that 17 Virginia Tech students were being treated for gunshot wounds and other injuries.
[00:41:17.113 --> 00:41:18.533]  Sharon Honaker at a
[00:41:20.143 --> 00:41:27.050]  Carrollton New River Valley Medical Center told CNN that four parents had been transported there, one in critical conditions.
[00:41:27.871 --> 00:41:32.055]  Since one person was killed, the others were wounded in multiple locations inside the dormitory.
[00:41:32.435 --> 00:41:41.264]  About 7.15 a.m., Flynchem said, two hours later, another shooting at Norris Hall, an engineering building, two hours later.
[00:41:41.284 --> 00:41:41.324]  Oh!
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.242]  Somebody's running around shooting everybody, but you can't stop it, and we didn't hear about it on the news.
[00:41:48.363 --> 00:41:49.123]  I was on Drudge.
[00:41:49.203 --> 00:41:50.344]  I was on the news this morning.
[00:41:50.664 --> 00:41:51.884]  What is going on here?
[00:41:52.245 --> 00:41:59.909]  I mean, the fact that this wasn't, that place wasn't already had troops, you know, that's what the police are, swarming it, is insane.
[00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.711]  And let me just give everybody a news flash.
[00:42:03.731 --> 00:42:06.552]  If somebody's around my neighborhood shooting people, I'm gonna get my gun.
[00:42:06.572 --> 00:42:07.413]  It's right here beside me.
[00:42:07.453 --> 00:42:08.833]  I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna start shooting them.
[00:42:09.714 --> 00:42:11.475]  Of course, the cops are so dumb, they'll probably shoot me.
[00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:14.839]  But, uh, I mean, I don't know how people just sit around.
[00:42:14.879 --> 00:42:18.261]  Is some guy shooting and then hours later he's shooting somewhere else on the campus?
[00:42:19.142 --> 00:42:20.503]  Somebody's going around shooting people.
[00:42:20.543 --> 00:42:21.744]  Man, I'm gonna go gun them down.
[00:42:22.004 --> 00:42:23.406]  Let me just give everybody a newsflash.
[00:42:23.646 --> 00:42:27.909]  And that's what they did back when the tower shooter in the 60's was up there blasting people.
[00:42:27.929 --> 00:42:35.335]  Everybody just pulled up, pulled their rifles out and pinned them down so the police could, and we've had the police on here that did that, could go up there and kill that piece of garbage.
[00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:37.451]  Not anymore, man.
[00:42:37.471 --> 00:42:42.794]  You start pulling your guns out of citizens trying to help the cops, I guarantee you they'll just blow your guts off right up against the wall.
[00:42:43.415 --> 00:42:44.676]  Because they've been trained, we're the enemy.
[00:42:46.437 --> 00:42:48.899]  They'll just, they'll splatter you all over the seamen.
[00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:52.861]  It goes on here.
[00:42:53.542 --> 00:42:59.166]  One person was killed and others were wounded at multiple locations inside a dormitory about 7.15 a.m., Fletcher said.
[00:42:59.706 --> 00:43:05.190]  Two hours later, another shooting at Norris Hall, an engineering building, resulted in multiple casualties, the University reported.
[00:43:06.229 --> 00:43:07.709]  By the way, go to CNN.
[00:43:07.749 --> 00:43:08.310]  Get that audio.
[00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:09.630]  We're going to play that, John.
[00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.711]  Go to CNN and go to that story.
[00:43:13.811 --> 00:43:15.411]  Chief, at least 20 dead in campus shootings.
[00:43:15.671 --> 00:43:16.892]  Third paragraph's got a video.
[00:43:16.912 --> 00:43:17.532]  I want to play that.
[00:43:18.512 --> 00:43:26.614]  The first reported shooting occurred at West Ambler-Johnson Hall, a co-ed dormitory that houses 895 students.
[00:43:26.634 --> 00:43:29.255]  The dormitory, one of the largest residents of the hall.
[00:43:29.275 --> 00:43:30.855]  2,600 acre campus is located near the
[00:43:34.918 --> 00:43:36.400]  Drill field and stadium.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:41.805]  Now, again, this could just be some disgruntled nut who hates the girls.
[00:43:42.266 --> 00:43:43.147]  It could be that, too.
[00:43:43.607 --> 00:43:44.588]  Very low probability.
[00:43:45.229 --> 00:43:48.172]  Every time we give them the benefit of the doubt and think it's just some nut, I hope it's a nut.
[00:43:48.532 --> 00:43:56.400]  But generally, special psychiatric care, usually with a former top government colonel in psych warfare, that'll be totally ignored in the media.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.062]  They'll be hopped up on drugs.
[00:43:58.642 --> 00:44:02.065]  And they would have been gone for a couple months at strange facilities.
[00:44:02.085 --> 00:44:05.128]  They'll have a Pentagon email.
[00:44:05.208 --> 00:44:06.769]  I mean, this is what always happens.
[00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.272]  Buford Furrow, the Jewish Center in L.A.
[00:44:13.215 --> 00:44:20.201]  It goes on to say, Amy Steele, editor-in-chief of the campus newspaper, said one of her reporters at the dormitory reported mass chaos.
[00:44:21.871 --> 00:44:27.053]  I mean, back in the day when my dad was going to U2, they just all had their guns right there with them because they'd go out shooting.
[00:44:27.354 --> 00:44:28.614]  That guy wouldn't have been around long.
[00:44:29.214 --> 00:44:35.097]  The reporters said there were lots of students running around going crazy, and the police officers were trying to settle everyone down and keep everything under control.
[00:44:35.417 --> 00:44:36.537]  Yeah, that's the modern world.
[00:44:36.818 --> 00:44:38.298]  Keep everybody under control.
[00:44:38.358 --> 00:44:44.741]  The cops should have ignored the people running around, and they should have gone seeking and destroying for who had the weapon.
[00:44:45.981 --> 00:44:47.342]  And cops used to do that in the past.
[00:44:47.382 --> 00:44:48.102]  They were fearless.
[00:44:48.943 --> 00:44:49.823]  And I've studied it.
[00:44:50.459 --> 00:44:51.080]  Not now, man.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:57.064]  They all wait for orders and put their body armor on and wet themselves like a bunch of pieces of filth.
[00:44:59.066 --> 00:45:00.647]  I mean, I just don't understand it.
[00:45:00.767 --> 00:45:01.688]  I just don't understand it.
[00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:07.693]  I mean, you instinctively just spring into action to kill somebody that's going around blasting innocent people.
[00:45:09.775 --> 00:45:15.539]  The reporter said there were lots of students running around going crazy, so I guess this is like Columbine, where this just went on for hours.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:16.820]  Oh my God.
[00:45:17.001 --> 00:45:19.803]  See, I didn't even know what was going on, and I said, this went on for hours, Black Op.
[00:45:20.706 --> 00:45:21.427]  Hours and hours.
[00:45:22.147 --> 00:45:23.468]  And then it's just now on CNN.
[00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:25.170]  This is, oh, oh my gosh.
[00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.071]  It's just the same MO every time, see?
[00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:31.695]  The report is that there were lots of students running around going crazy.
[00:45:32.015 --> 00:45:37.079]  The police officers were trying to slow everybody down and keep everything under control, according to the, uh, to Steele.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:43.804]  And it says, uh, Kristen Heiser said she was in a class at about 9.30 a.m.
[00:45:43.924 --> 00:45:45.945]  Now, understand, these are the shooting people.
[00:45:46.526 --> 00:45:47.767]  This is probably a group of people.
[00:45:49.315 --> 00:45:52.516]  That'll probably get reported, but then it'll just be one patsy.
[00:45:55.497 --> 00:46:00.438]  So this was going on at 7 in the morning, and now at 9.30 it's still going on.
[00:46:00.978 --> 00:46:10.241]  Kristen Heiser said she was in class by 9.30am when she and her classmates saw about six gun-wielding police officers run by a window.
[00:46:11.391 --> 00:46:12.772]  We were like, what's going on?
[00:46:12.832 --> 00:46:18.097]  Because there definitely is a quaint town where stuff doesn't really happen.
[00:46:18.457 --> 00:46:26.443]  It's pretty boring here, said Heizer, and that's where the feds always strike, during a phone interview as she sat at her classroom floor.
[00:46:26.964 --> 00:46:30.947]  I've been telling you, we're going to have like a bees-lawn massacre, which we told you was an inside job.
[00:46:31.207 --> 00:46:36.532]  The reporter that tried to cover it got drugged and poisoned, and then when she wouldn't shut up, they gunned her down at her house.
[00:46:36.972 --> 00:46:37.612]  And this is simple.
[00:46:37.652 --> 00:46:39.094]  Guys put on masks, they go in,
[00:46:39.734 --> 00:46:46.223]  Then they have, they evacuate out the back, the military blows the front of the building off, and machine guns people as they try to run to safety.
[00:46:46.823 --> 00:46:47.765]  Same thing with the theater.
[00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:57.397]  You got government operatives that are kidnapping, they put on masks, and the people that survived saw this, they put masks on, then the gas comes in, then they escape out the back.
[00:46:58.212 --> 00:47:04.638]  In Saudi Arabia, with some of the bombings, the Saudi media reported that the U.S.
[00:47:04.678 --> 00:47:05.579]  was there in the U.S.
[00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:07.740]  controlled compounds helping them get to safety.
[00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:09.062]  It's the same M.O.
[00:47:09.442 --> 00:47:10.163]  over and over.
[00:47:10.203 --> 00:47:10.523]  It's easy.
[00:47:13.826 --> 00:47:15.007]  We were like, what's going on?
[00:47:15.027 --> 00:47:16.268]  This is definitely a quaint town.
[00:47:16.628 --> 00:47:25.596]  Student Matt Waldron said he did not hear the gunshots because he was listening to music, but he heard police sirens and saw officers hiding behind trees with their guns drawn.
[00:47:26.056 --> 00:47:27.898]  Hiding behind trees.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.081]  Hiding behind trees.
[00:47:32.722 --> 00:47:37.706]  You find out where the shots are coming from, and it's your job.
[00:47:37.786 --> 00:47:38.507]  You signed up.
[00:47:38.927 --> 00:47:41.049]  You've got the Billy Bob, you're tough attitude.
[00:47:41.795 --> 00:47:43.036]  This is what you're supposed to do.
[00:47:43.216 --> 00:47:45.817]  You're supposed to charge the tower, or charge the building.
[00:47:46.037 --> 00:47:47.038]  I don't want to hear it from you.
[00:47:47.238 --> 00:47:48.699]  Cops in the past did it!
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.380]  That's what you're supposed to do!
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.741]  That's what you signed on for!
[00:47:53.101 --> 00:47:55.823]  And you go in there, and you kill that son of a bitch!
[00:47:58.204 --> 00:47:59.165]  Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[00:48:01.066 --> 00:48:02.827]  That's what you do, and I don't want to hear it.
[00:48:03.147 --> 00:48:08.110]  Over and over again, you sit there for hours, wetting yourselves nowadays, because you're a cowardly scum.
[00:48:08.832 --> 00:48:17.482]  You stopped becoming defenders of the people and you became revenue generators, and all the training was about how to keep yourself safe, and how it's you against the people, and all your bull.
[00:48:17.782 --> 00:48:20.505]  And I know there's real cops out there that would have gone in there and taken this person out.
[00:48:20.725 --> 00:48:24.369]  But they're so trained to go under orders, they had to wait until the boss got there.
[00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:29.996]  The boss is always some lily-livered coward who licks boots to move up the chain.
[00:48:30.496 --> 00:48:35.657]  You know, who plays Pinochle with the limp-wristed Dean, you know what I mean?
[00:48:36.137 --> 00:48:44.799]  And you gotta wait until your little wobbly, nelly, police boss shows up, and then you're all sitting there, or you're fired.
[00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:46.780]  They train you how to be cowards.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:57.562]  Student Matt Waldron said he did not hear the gunshots because he was listening to music, but he heard police officers hiding behind trees with their guns drawn.
[00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:02.753]  They told us to get out of there, so we ran across the drill field as quick as we could, he said.
[00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:09.297]  Walden described the scenes of the campus mayhem, watching students recording them police, and it goes on.
[00:49:09.317 --> 00:49:10.578]  There's several clips here.
[00:49:10.618 --> 00:49:14.421]  Get the cops shooting, and get the... Do you have those clips ready yet, John?
[00:49:18.864 --> 00:49:19.444]  No, no, it's okay.
[00:49:19.464 --> 00:49:20.245]  We'll get it after the break.
[00:49:20.265 --> 00:49:20.785]  Start playing it.
[00:49:21.346 --> 00:49:23.247]  But, but, but, but, but get the gunshot one.
[00:49:26.111 --> 00:49:28.132]  It was kind of scary, he said.
[00:49:28.152 --> 00:49:32.293]  These two kids, I guess, had panicked and jumped out of the top story window.
[00:49:32.973 --> 00:49:37.974]  And the one kid broke his ankle and the other girl was not in good shape, just lying on the ground.
[00:49:39.074 --> 00:49:40.814]  It's better than getting shot up there in the dorm.
[00:49:41.495 --> 00:49:41.715]  See?
[00:49:41.955 --> 00:49:43.335]  Oh, it's a gun-free zone.
[00:49:44.295 --> 00:49:47.696]  I mean, if I would have lived in a dorm in college, folks, I guarantee you I'd have had a gun.
[00:49:48.116 --> 00:49:49.836]  And somebody would have started going around shooting.
[00:49:49.876 --> 00:49:52.917]  I'd have gone and just... I mean, that's just the way it is.
[00:49:54.629 --> 00:49:59.191]  I mean, I remember talking to my dad growing up.
[00:49:59.231 --> 00:50:02.392]  I said, what did you do when he came in your office and was up here robbing?
[00:50:02.412 --> 00:50:09.596]  He goes, well, just like I was hunting a deer, I'd real quietly come up to the edge here with my pistol and I'd shoot him a couple times in the back.
[00:50:10.596 --> 00:50:11.756]  That's how you handle it.
[00:50:13.037 --> 00:50:15.318]  You just sneak up on him like you're hunting quail and you kill him.
[00:50:16.895 --> 00:50:21.018]  And if you got people inside a building that are being shot, you charge in there and you take them out.
[00:50:21.659 --> 00:50:24.040]  I mean, this is what real men live for.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.321]  I don't know.
[00:50:25.341 --> 00:50:27.042]  I mean, I just can imagine.
[00:50:27.343 --> 00:50:30.105]  I know right now I'd charge in there and kill that SOB.
[00:50:31.426 --> 00:50:32.386]  And I'd probably get shot.
[00:50:32.426 --> 00:50:33.087]  It just doesn't matter.
[00:50:33.107 --> 00:50:35.128]  I don't understand how we became such cowards.
[00:50:35.328 --> 00:50:37.470]  Men used to like to defend innocents.
[00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:39.611]  Men used to like to go after bullies.
[00:50:39.652 --> 00:50:41.093]  Men used to like to go after scum.
[00:50:43.694 --> 00:50:44.815]  I mean, that's what you're here for.
[00:50:44.835 --> 00:50:45.676]  That's why you're a man.
[00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:49.215]  You, uh, metro-sexual cowards.
[00:50:49.816 --> 00:50:50.498]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.907 --> 00:51:05.387]  It's here!
[00:51:05.607 --> 00:51:10.369]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:18.353]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.085 --> 00:51:26.131]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.531 --> 00:51:38.040]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.281 --> 00:51:41.884]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.204 --> 00:51:44.185]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.506 --> 00:51:48.349]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:03.533]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.773 --> 00:53:07.455]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.795 --> 00:53:09.997]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:10.517 --> 00:53:16.720]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:21.763]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.

[00:53:40.761 --> 00:53:41.442]  We're good to go!
[00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:07.333]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:54:07.793 --> 00:54:11.077]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.657 --> 00:54:18.164]  Alright, CNN and Fox are both reporting that the guy's been killed, but they're telling everybody to stay indoors.
[00:54:19.185 --> 00:54:25.792]  I guess while the guys in gunny suits evacuate, because there might be a gunman on the loose.
[00:54:26.798 --> 00:54:33.522]  Now, again, this could be some nut, but that's a low probability because we've seen this so much, and the fact that this is drug on for hours is very suspicious.
[00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:38.406]  I'm told we've got a caller one mile from this in Virginia named Matt.
[00:54:38.806 --> 00:54:40.127]  Matt, thank you for joining us.
[00:54:40.167 --> 00:54:40.847]  What's going on?
[00:54:41.928 --> 00:54:44.309]  Well, I'm about a block away from where the whole thing happened.
[00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:45.150]  I woke up in the corner.
[00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.590]  Oh, a block.
[00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:46.191]  Okay, you're a block.
[00:54:46.251 --> 00:54:47.532]  I'm going to start over.
[00:54:47.732 --> 00:54:49.613]  Tell us the town you're in, what you're witnessing.
[00:54:50.488 --> 00:54:51.588]  Blacksburg, Virginia.
[00:54:51.869 --> 00:55:00.251]  I'm on the campus of Virginia Tech and woke up this morning to loudspeakers going off saying that there's a shooter on campus.
[00:55:00.311 --> 00:55:01.451]  Please stay inside.
[00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:06.613]  And they just put up this big loudspeaker system because we had another school shooting a while back.
[00:55:07.493 --> 00:55:11.874]  At the first day of the school year, a guy went nuts and shot a couple of cops.
[00:55:12.615 --> 00:55:14.875]  This is the real deal.
[00:55:15.435 --> 00:55:17.456]  The first report was that there were two shooters
[00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:21.413]  Always the same, it's oh my god.
[00:55:21.433 --> 00:55:23.135]  Two shooters total.
[00:55:23.696 --> 00:55:24.277]  Oh my god.
[00:55:24.958 --> 00:55:39.214]  So then basically then what it's shaped into so far is that there was a guy who shot three people at AJ dorm which is just oh it's about a half mile from here and then fled across campus went into a classroom and killed everybody.
[00:55:40.962 --> 00:55:42.383]  And then killed himself is the word.
[00:55:42.584 --> 00:55:47.368]  And I bet money if the cops would have scrambled immediately, they could have seen this guy running around with a gun.
[00:55:47.388 --> 00:55:48.569]  They should have just attacked him.
[00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:50.511]  I just cannot believe it.
[00:55:50.551 --> 00:55:52.213]  I mean, I'm sorry folks, I've studied this stuff.
[00:55:52.473 --> 00:55:54.575]  When people tried this in the past, the cops just killed them.
[00:55:55.036 --> 00:55:56.797]  I mean, the cops didn't used to be like this.
[00:55:57.038 --> 00:55:57.798]  I just can't believe it.
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:04.405]  Well, this is crazy because we've had four bomb threats this week on the same street.
[00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:10.532]  There was another bomb threat today, and they had to evacuate all these rescue vehicles because of another bomb threat.
[00:56:10.572 --> 00:56:16.594]  I mean, they pulled out the whole... There was every cop in three counties out here just the other day, right on this very street.
[00:56:16.794 --> 00:56:19.756]  Well, that shows... Listen, this has got Black Op written all over it.
[00:56:19.816 --> 00:56:20.236]  That's right.
[00:56:20.256 --> 00:56:21.957]  I remember hearing about the last shooting.
[00:56:22.157 --> 00:56:25.278]  You got a shooting there in this little rural area, then another one.
[00:56:25.618 --> 00:56:26.719]  Weird bomb threats.
[00:56:27.359 --> 00:56:28.440]  Oh my God.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:32.042]  Somebody's got to get to the school surveillance camera tapes and data banks.
[00:56:32.062 --> 00:56:34.283]  I bet you're going to see a lot of suspicious people in there.
[00:56:34.563 --> 00:56:36.244]  Now they're saying they've killed the shooter now.
[00:56:36.284 --> 00:56:37.285]  Is that what they're saying?
[00:56:37.305 --> 00:56:37.485]  No.
[00:56:38.105 --> 00:56:42.928]  What I heard last was that he had killed himself and they've kind of dropped the two-shooter thing.
[00:56:42.948 --> 00:56:44.669]  I haven't heard anything else about that.
[00:56:44.749 --> 00:56:48.291]  And it looks, from the activities of the police, it looks like it's over.
[00:56:49.992 --> 00:56:52.454]  There was a big shift a few hours back.
[00:56:52.694 --> 00:56:53.314]  Let me ask you.
[00:56:53.374 --> 00:56:54.655]  What's your gut on this, Matt?
[00:56:56.256 --> 00:56:57.597]  You know, I don't know yet, Alex.
[00:56:57.637 --> 00:56:59.798]  I'm going to have to wait and hear how it all rolls out.
[00:57:00.418 --> 00:57:04.761]  All I can tell you is what I've heard so far, and I've never seen anything like this in this town.
[00:57:04.861 --> 00:57:17.647]  And I will say this, it's been a very strange week living where I'm living because, like I said just a couple of days ago, every cop in three counties, I mean all of them, they were all in their SWAT gear and everything.
[00:57:18.208 --> 00:57:20.869]  Somebody's been calling in bomb threats all week.
[00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:24.831]  And I don't know, it's kind of, isn't that kind of strange?
[00:57:25.797 --> 00:57:31.699]  Well, that could be the crazy person, or it could be somebody inside intelligence that didn't want this black op to go forward.
[00:57:32.279 --> 00:57:36.361]  Bottom line, maybe up to 35 people.
[00:57:36.381 --> 00:57:37.601]  35 now, dead.
[00:57:38.341 --> 00:57:40.582]  I just saw that during the break, they were saying over 30.
[00:57:41.022 --> 00:57:43.003]  This is absolutely disgusting.
[00:57:43.443 --> 00:57:46.384]  Look, immediately, it's time to rearm the pilots.
[00:57:47.242 --> 00:57:51.446]  It is time, because they were armed, they could be armed before 9-11, two months before they change the law.
[00:57:51.867 --> 00:57:52.588]  Very suspicious.
[00:57:52.968 --> 00:57:58.553]  It's time that if a professor wants to have a gun, that there be a secured lockbox.
[00:57:59.454 --> 00:58:01.156]  They go take some certification course.
[00:58:01.536 --> 00:58:07.983]  There be a secured lockbox underneath their table or desk.
[00:58:08.892 --> 00:58:20.257]  And, uh, it's time to trust the citizenry again, and this piece of garbage might have been able to kill four or five people, but I guarantee you every other professor would want to run, and they'd have killed this son of a bitch.
[00:58:20.477 --> 00:58:25.439]  I'm sorry to talk like that, but people have been killed, and I'm tired of it, and stay there, Matt, because...
[00:58:26.119 --> 00:58:26.679]  Stay there, Matt.
[00:58:26.759 --> 00:58:32.161]  I want to get you on the other side, and I want to debrief you on everything you've seen as somebody that lives on campus.
[00:58:32.221 --> 00:58:32.701]  Okay, Matt?
[00:58:33.082 --> 00:58:33.682]  Sure, thank you.
[00:58:33.702 --> 00:58:34.562]  Alright, stay there.
[00:58:34.602 --> 00:58:40.684]  We'll be right back with Matt, who joins us from Virginia on the campus, where there has been massive killing.
[00:58:41.765 --> 00:58:46.806]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.826 --> 00:58:48.027]  Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:59.273 --> 00:58:59.934]  Big Brother.
[00:59:00.594 --> 00:59:01.635]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:02.355 --> 00:59:03.456]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:04.116 --> 00:59:04.957]  You want answers?
[00:59:05.697 --> 00:59:06.578]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.598 --> 00:59:10.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:11.441 --> 00:59:15.603]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.024 --> 00:59:20.806]  Matt Kazee is a Genesis listener.
[00:59:21.827 --> 00:59:23.648]  He's also involved in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:59:23.668 --> 00:59:24.749]  I was just talking to him during the break.
[00:59:25.624 --> 00:59:29.446]  And he's agreed to go on the record with his full name, Matt Kazee.
[00:59:30.186 --> 00:59:31.247]  K-A-Z-E-E.
[00:59:32.147 --> 00:59:35.009]  And he's gonna get the floor now with this Virginia shooting.
[00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:36.629]  They're now saying it could be as many as 34 dead.
[00:59:38.317 --> 00:59:41.218]  And we have some audio clips that are going to be coming up as well here.
[00:59:41.258 --> 00:59:42.339]  We'll continue to take your phone calls.
[00:59:42.359 --> 00:59:45.340]  I'm about to get into the big 9-11 developments on Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.901]  We've got to keep pushing and exposing that.
[00:59:46.941 --> 00:59:50.543]  Can't let this shooting become the total distraction, but it is important.
[00:59:51.243 --> 00:59:55.025]  And it's either a complete nut or it has a lot of tell-tale earmarks that will black off.
[00:59:55.485 --> 00:59:59.107]  Now you're there living on campus a block away from where a lot of this happened.
[00:59:59.367 --> 01:00:00.328]  You're right in the middle of it.
[01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:05.310]  Start with what you heard, what you saw, what the first media reports were.
[01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:06.271]  Walk us through it.
[01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:06.811]  Take your time.
[01:00:07.552 --> 01:00:11.577]  Alright, this morning I woke up to a loudspeaker going off.
[01:00:11.657 --> 01:00:14.340]  I thought it was somebody driving by with a bullhorn, actually.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:22.749]  But I found out that they had just installed these loudspeakers across campus because of the last school shooting that we had, which was the first day of the school year.
[01:00:24.691 --> 01:00:26.093]  Stop right there.
[01:00:26.133 --> 01:00:27.875]  Let's go back and detail that one.
[01:00:28.582 --> 01:00:30.143]  Okay, actually, I knew this guy.
[01:00:30.163 --> 01:00:33.986]  He was a kid who went to high school around here.
[01:00:34.127 --> 01:00:35.207]  Everybody knew this kid.
[01:00:36.068 --> 01:00:39.451]  His brother fought in the Afghanistan War.
[01:00:40.452 --> 01:00:41.713]  They got in a little bit of trouble.
[01:00:42.713 --> 01:00:49.259]  His brother tried to rob an ATM machine, and he was involved in some other type of robbery.
[01:00:49.739 --> 01:00:53.682]  He broke out of jail, killed maybe three people.
[01:00:53.702 --> 01:00:54.683]  Two of them were cops.
[01:00:55.655 --> 01:01:04.002]  And the brother, like I said, because he was his brother and was apparently involved in this, they just gave him 35 years.
[01:01:05.783 --> 01:01:09.606]  But the whole community has been shook up by this terrible tragedy that we just had.
[01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:19.487]  And today... So it all starts with an Afghan operator, an American troop who'd been in combat.
[01:01:20.308 --> 01:01:22.229]  He was just... That was the brother of the shooter.
[01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:26.132]  I understand, but it's all tied into that, just like with the tower.
[01:01:26.192 --> 01:01:26.933]  Please continue.
[01:01:28.134 --> 01:01:31.417]  Anyway, so they had installed these loudspeakers.
[01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:37.802]  That's what I heard this morning was basically an alert, a warning that there's a shooter on campus.
[01:01:37.842 --> 01:01:38.802]  Please stay indoors.
[01:01:38.842 --> 01:01:39.663]  Stay off the streets.
[01:01:39.703 --> 01:01:40.744]  Stay away from windows.
[01:01:42.451 --> 01:01:57.023]  I heard that for maybe 20 minutes before it actually hit the news, and when the news came on, it was that there was a shooter on campus, that maybe two people or three people had been shot, but no confirmation of any of that.
[01:01:57.603 --> 01:02:02.886]  And as it developed, we were just flooded with ambulances and rescue.
[01:02:02.906 --> 01:02:06.508]  The whole SWAT team showing up right out and very close by here.
[01:02:06.668 --> 01:02:09.709]  And we went out and started talking to people on the street to find out what was going on.
[01:02:09.769 --> 01:02:16.913]  Well, this is also a victim disarmament zone because under federal law, none of the citizens can have guns that live on campus.
[01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:20.735]  So it's a perfect place for a black op because nobody's got guns.
[01:02:20.795 --> 01:02:21.375]  Please continue.
[01:02:22.456 --> 01:02:26.338]  Yes, and it was basically pretty well known
[01:02:27.023 --> 01:02:36.449]  Early on, the first word was that there were multiple shooters and I think that had to do with how many people it was being reported that were killed.
[01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:46.615]  He killed three people, or at least shot three people, killed at least one of those three, I think maybe all three, a few blocks away from here.
[01:02:46.835 --> 01:02:49.557]  I'm making a prediction, a guesstimation.
[01:02:49.697 --> 01:02:52.479]  I bet he's going to be an Iraq or Afghan vet.
[01:02:54.614 --> 01:02:56.735]  Yeah, well, we'll see if that comes true.
[01:02:56.755 --> 01:02:57.356]  You never know.
[01:02:57.376 --> 01:03:00.658]  Because if they're not going to be our cops... It's about the ROTC, by the way.
[01:03:01.158 --> 01:03:02.459]  Oh, it happened by the ROTC?
[01:03:02.519 --> 01:03:08.262]  Oh, no, it's... Literally half a block away from the ROTC buildings and all the ROTC dorms.
[01:03:08.462 --> 01:03:09.623]  Yeah, it's the military.
[01:03:09.763 --> 01:03:18.348]  And watch, he's going to be disappeared for the last few months, and then we'll dig out that he was at a special installation being given psychiatric care.
[01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:21.410]  I'll tell you what... No, this happens over and over again.
[01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.911]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:22.451]  Please continue.
[01:03:23.107 --> 01:03:23.627]  No, no, no.
[01:03:24.108 --> 01:03:30.311]  I'll tell you what I did hear about that was that it was a kid who was going to a specific classroom.
[01:03:30.351 --> 01:03:31.952]  Now this is not confirmed.
[01:03:31.992 --> 01:03:33.613]  This was one of the last things that I heard.
[01:03:33.653 --> 01:03:37.215]  It was a kid going to a specific classroom because of whatever.
[01:03:37.275 --> 01:03:39.576]  Some people were making fun of him or whatever.
[01:03:40.977 --> 01:03:43.318]  So they're now saying it's a trench coat mafia type deal?
[01:03:44.162 --> 01:03:50.389]  Uh, that's what, the media's not saying anything locally as far as whether they've actually got the guy or not.
[01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:54.274]  Stay there, stay there, tell us more on the other side, eyewitness.
[01:03:58.078 --> 01:03:59.880]  It's here, after a year in production.

[01:05:59.533 --> 01:06:01.454]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:06:01.534 --> 01:06:05.756]  On April 13, 2007, Gold Spot 68141 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 704.21, 353.94 for half ounce, and 170.707 for quarter ounce coins.
[01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:06.196]  That's 704.21, 353.94, and 170.707.
[01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:22.144]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:06:22.204 --> 01:06:25.165]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:06:25.285 --> 01:06:34.369]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is virally out of control.
[01:06:34.669 --> 01:06:39.971]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:06:40.451 --> 01:06:42.732]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:06:42.772 --> 01:06:45.232]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:06:45.612 --> 01:06:47.233]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:52.654]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:06:52.694 --> 01:06:53.375]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:06:54.675 --> 01:06:59.736]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:02.357]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:05.186 --> 01:07:08.967]  Alright, huge new 9-11 truth developments with Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:07:09.027 --> 01:07:17.330]  I haven't even had a chance to get to yet because this mass shooting, it could be as many as 34 dead.
[01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:18.570]  The number continues to go up.
[01:07:19.991 --> 01:07:23.032]  I kept saying on air, folks, you're going to have some university or high school shooting.
[01:07:23.092 --> 01:07:24.152]  It could be as many as 100 dead.
[01:07:24.192 --> 01:07:30.234]  That's what I've been saying in the past because these black ops are just bad news.
[01:07:30.314 --> 01:07:33.355]  Not to mention all the brainwashed drug addict youth that is just
[01:07:34.228 --> 01:07:39.331]  Snorting methamphetamine and playing 15 hours of video games a day where all they do is mass shoot people.
[01:07:39.692 --> 01:07:47.997]  Those were developed by the Pentagon to instinctively block the inhibition towards splattering innocent people.
[01:07:49.356 --> 01:07:51.158]  And it's just instinctive firing.
[01:07:51.538 --> 01:08:01.868]  Because in the past, going back 30, 40, 50 years, you had a few mass shooters, but they start shooting little kids or women and children in a McDonald's and they start getting, you know, throwing up, getting sick.
[01:08:02.368 --> 01:08:03.810]  Because you're built not to do that.
[01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:09.575]  You're built to feel good when somebody attacks you and they're big and bad and, you know, you strike back and they hit the ground.
[01:08:10.565 --> 01:08:11.646]  I mean, that's instinctive.
[01:08:12.086 --> 01:08:14.848]  I mean, your design, really, you have almost morals built into you.
[01:08:14.868 --> 01:08:20.212]  And then when you break that code, I guess, and then sin against, you know, your very nature, I don't know how to explain it.
[01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:24.716]  The point is, I'm getting off into just how people operate.
[01:08:25.877 --> 01:08:31.881]  It's just absolutely amazing that they had victim disarmament, total gun ban on all the campuses in America.
[01:08:31.901 --> 01:08:39.407]  I had a friend one time who was, UT campus is just giant, and he was walking across just a corner of campus.
[01:08:40.596 --> 01:08:44.540]  And the cop saw that he had a fanny pack and he had a concealed carry.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.802]  And he walked over and said, what is that?
[01:08:47.142 --> 01:08:48.324]  He said, oh, that's my concealed carry.
[01:08:48.344 --> 01:08:51.026]  And they said, boom, up against the wall, put him up against the bus stop.
[01:08:51.066 --> 01:08:52.948]  And he was literally about 10 feet on the campus.
[01:08:53.288 --> 01:08:58.894]  They just wait, lurking to get our best and brightest and most upright citizens.
[01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:01.316]  By the way, all the gun grabbers, we're about to go back to our guest.
[01:09:01.336 --> 01:09:02.677]  I'm going to go back to Mark.
[01:09:04.564 --> 01:09:07.891]  We're going to be talking to him in just a moment.
[01:09:15.302 --> 01:09:28.554]  I had another friend who had forgotten about the federal law and I was walking across campus and going to a Patriot meeting and some cops showed up because he was giving people silver, $8 at the time, little silver pieces.
[01:09:28.574 --> 01:09:30.656]  $10 pieces were really worth about $8.
[01:09:31.016 --> 01:09:34.680]  He was showing them to people, you know, liberty money and going, oh look at this great.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:40.185]  And the cops thought that was illegal and then came to arrest him for just, they thought it was counterfeit.
[01:09:40.205 --> 01:09:41.426]  They thought you're not allowed to have
[01:09:42.126 --> 01:09:44.568]  Silver struck, you know, other than the government.
[01:09:44.588 --> 01:09:55.454]  Remember the guy who went and bought like a $50 item at Best Buy with $2 bills, and the clerks thought it was illegal, the manager thought it was illegal.
[01:09:55.474 --> 01:09:58.676]  They were all so dumb that they thought that was counterfeit.
[01:09:58.976 --> 01:10:00.477]  You see, that's one reason they want to dumb us down.
[01:10:00.517 --> 01:10:03.319]  And a lot of the public folks is literally retarded now.
[01:10:03.559 --> 01:10:08.862]  They've been conditioned to do nothing but entertainment, so they never have any of their own thoughts, and they're totally dumb.
[01:10:09.862 --> 01:10:10.922]  And remember that case?
[01:10:10.942 --> 01:10:11.563]  He went to jail.
[01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:12.603]  They went ahead and arrested him.
[01:10:12.643 --> 01:10:14.563]  The cops thought it was fake, too.
[01:10:14.883 --> 01:10:16.024]  None of the cops that showed up.
[01:10:16.284 --> 01:10:18.424]  And then, of course, the higher-ups went, You idiots!
[01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:19.085]  Let him go!
[01:10:19.105 --> 01:10:20.265]  $2 bills!
[01:10:20.285 --> 01:10:21.245]  What are you talking about?
[01:10:21.265 --> 01:10:24.806]  You know, they got him signing a Declaration of Independence on the back.
[01:10:24.826 --> 01:10:25.466]  They're really neat.
[01:10:25.506 --> 01:10:26.727]  I've got a couple of them.
[01:10:28.867 --> 01:10:34.529]  It's just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, that I've had to go speak at UT.
[01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:41.022]  While I was getting death threats, and while really scary people were coming around, I mean, you talk about...
[01:10:43.141 --> 01:10:58.509]  And I had a police officer bodyguard there and he couldn't even, well one of my listeners, now I never had bodyguards in the past, but there was a guy in a black trench coat going around, he went to another meeting I was at and was pulling his hand out and pointing it at me like it was a gun, the back of the, I mean, really scaring everybody.
[01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:01.391]  So I, and everybody's like, no, you gotta have a bodyguard, you gotta have a bodyguard.
[01:11:01.411 --> 01:11:02.752]  So I said, okay, I'll get one.
[01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:03.852]  Couldn't have a gun.
[01:11:03.872 --> 01:11:10.556]  I mean, even a cop couldn't have a gun on their off-duty on federal property, on God property, on state property under federal law.
[01:11:11.799 --> 01:11:13.660]  Uh, so, that's how it works, folks.
[01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:16.922]  And, uh, that's how America operates.
[01:11:17.422 --> 01:11:18.703]  Everybody's like, wear a bulletproof vest.
[01:11:18.763 --> 01:11:20.204]  I'm like, no, I'm not going to wear a bulletproof vest.
[01:11:20.244 --> 01:11:21.344]  I'm frankly not worried about it.
[01:11:21.564 --> 01:11:23.966]  I don't want to die, but, you know, just, I'm not worried about it.
[01:11:23.986 --> 01:11:24.886]  I'm not going to live in fear.
[01:11:25.887 --> 01:11:28.128]  And, uh, you know, that's just the way it is.
[01:11:29.269 --> 01:11:31.510]  Uh, but, uh, the cop was wearing a bulletproof vest.
[01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:32.530]  He was just going to tackle.
[01:11:33.191 --> 01:11:36.593]  He actually had two cops there, but I'm already digressing and some other people.
[01:11:36.633 --> 01:11:40.895]  But, um, then that's a real cop, you know, ready to tackle somebody.
[01:11:41.981 --> 01:11:45.402]  Um, but, uh, and of course you have the UT Police there, totally worthless.
[01:11:46.523 --> 01:11:48.644]  I mean, literally, folks, when there's a shooter, they run and hide.
[01:11:48.924 --> 01:11:50.805]  And that basically happened here, but I'm gonna shut up.
[01:11:51.105 --> 01:11:56.467]  Let's play about a minute and a half clip of somebody on a cell phone with the gunshots going off, and we'll go back to our eyewitness guest.
[01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:56.967]  Here it is.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.643]  Okay, Jamal Alberguti is, I believe, on the phone with us now.
[01:12:08.804 --> 01:12:12.867]  Jamal, pretty unbelievable pictures that you have there.
[01:12:13.107 --> 01:12:13.848]  I'm hoping.
[01:12:13.868 --> 01:12:17.430]  It was a little frightening watching because it seemed like you were pretty darn close.
[01:12:17.871 --> 01:12:19.892]  We first heard a series of shots.
[01:12:20.353 --> 01:12:21.634]  We see the officers.
[01:12:22.374 --> 01:12:29.821]  Can't tell if those shots are coming from their guns or from possibly the person inside the building or outside of the building.
[01:12:30.801 --> 01:12:33.864]  Tell us what you were able to see with your own naked eye.
[01:12:35.223 --> 01:12:43.070]  Well, the first thing I saw is when the policemen started taking their guns out, and then I knew that this was serious.
[01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:47.693]  I really didn't hear anything about the shooting that happened in A.J.
[01:12:48.594 --> 01:12:53.178]  But when I saw the guns, I knew that this isn't another bomb threat.
[01:12:53.518 --> 01:12:57.241]  Then I started hearing some gunshots far away.
[01:12:58.162 --> 01:13:03.086]  It seemed to me that they were not at Norris Hall, the building where the cops were just
[01:13:03.835 --> 01:13:05.116]  We're good to go.
[01:13:23.887 --> 01:13:34.072]  There was a person in the building trying, on the second floor, at Norris, trying to tell the cops that he's in there, and probably trying to guide them in.
[01:13:34.592 --> 01:13:37.013]  Now, Jamal, were you able to hear that person?
[01:13:37.033 --> 01:13:44.757]  And again, just to be clear for our viewers, this is apparently Norris Hall, the site of the second shooting that took place at Virginia Tech this morning.
[01:13:45.397 --> 01:13:51.040]  Jamal, you were able to hear some type of conversation between somebody on the second floor and the police officers outside?
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.105]  Well, I wasn't, but I saw his hand from the window.
[01:13:55.185 --> 01:13:59.010]  He was trying to reach outside the window to talk to the cops.
[01:14:00.472 --> 01:14:02.094]  So, this is what I saw.
[01:14:02.674 --> 01:14:08.522]  I didn't actually hear him talking to them, but he was, well, he was, he was talking to them.
[01:14:08.662 --> 01:14:10.224]  I did not hear what he said.
[01:14:11.022 --> 01:14:12.603]  I was a little bit far away from there.
[01:14:13.083 --> 01:14:13.303]  All right.
[01:14:13.363 --> 01:14:23.107]  Now, after we see the pictures here that you were able to capture with your cell phone, we see that you actually moved quite a bit closer as the police went on down, I assume, inside the building.
[01:14:23.847 --> 01:14:25.087]  What happened after all of that?
[01:14:27.408 --> 01:14:33.050]  Well, I wasn't able to see anything because a cop came from behind me and he asked me to leave the area.
[01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.530]  Right.
[01:14:34.311 --> 01:14:36.471]  I imagine so, for your safety, obviously.
[01:14:38.331 --> 01:14:41.012]  We're going to our eyewitness who lives on campus.
[01:14:41.032 --> 01:14:45.134]  He is a 9-11 truther and he reminded me that he has called in for the show before.
[01:14:45.154 --> 01:14:57.640]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is happening at the Virginia Tech College there in the West Ambler Johnston Hall.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.641]  This is absolutely horrible.
[01:15:01.261 --> 01:15:02.522]  They're saying it could be well over
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.441]  34 people dead now.
[01:15:04.481 --> 01:15:06.402]  The number is just climbing.
[01:15:07.142 --> 01:15:13.465]  Going back to our guest, Matt Kazee.
[01:15:14.186 --> 01:15:15.486]  Matt, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:15:15.686 --> 01:15:17.427]  Please continue, and again, go back to the start.
[01:15:17.688 --> 01:15:23.511]  Go through all the facets, what you heard, the other bomb threats, and then detail what happened today.
[01:15:23.691 --> 01:15:24.291]  You've got the floor.
[01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:30.921]  I would have to say that the whole town has been on a little bit of tension because for the past week we've had multiple bomb threats.
[01:15:30.962 --> 01:15:31.982]  This happened a week ago.
[01:15:32.042 --> 01:15:36.605]  We had cleared out campus right over here where the second shooting was.
[01:15:36.625 --> 01:15:48.932]  Then they had at the end of the week, I guess this was probably Friday, I'm not sure, but at the end of the week they had three multiple bomb threats in one day.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.725]  And they brought in every vehicle that they could.
[01:15:53.627 --> 01:15:54.989]  They had the whole place covered.
[01:15:55.149 --> 01:16:01.720]  So in some ways, SWAT has been over and has covered this little area where all of this happened for the past week.
[01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:07.753]  They stayed until about 9.30, 10 o'clock that night, and nothing ever came from it.
[01:16:07.833 --> 01:16:10.815]  The campus put out a $5,000 reward for any information.
[01:16:11.336 --> 01:16:12.196]  Hadn't heard anything.
[01:16:12.717 --> 01:16:16.000]  Today, we all know what happened.
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:18.622]  It hit the fan, that's for sure.
[01:16:19.162 --> 01:16:26.469]  I just heard that report on the phone there, and it sounded like they were saying that he was trying to holler to the police from the window or something like that.
[01:16:27.329 --> 01:16:32.632]  Well, basically the individual is going around taking his time killing all the people that were told to stay indoors.
[01:16:32.752 --> 01:16:34.073]  They do the exact opposite.
[01:16:34.493 --> 01:16:38.395]  And so it looks like that there were people jumping out and other things.
[01:16:38.415 --> 01:16:39.696]  People saying, hey, he's in here.
[01:16:40.056 --> 01:16:42.758]  Help us while he's going around, you know, killing people.
[01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:50.363]  Who knows by then what really happened and we'll probably never know, you know, for a year or so, then we found out what happened to Columbine.
[01:16:50.383 --> 01:16:53.746]  I mean, do you really believe Harrison Clybull were able to get over 100?
[01:16:54.246 --> 01:16:56.447]  It was 124 bombs.
[01:16:56.808 --> 01:17:04.453]  Some of them, you know, huge 60-something gallon tanks of propane that two people could hardly carry.
[01:17:04.993 --> 01:17:05.834]  We're good to go.
[01:17:30.308 --> 01:17:32.354]  Harrison Kleibold made a video for the school.
[01:17:32.594 --> 01:17:35.140]  They were in the school's internet of how they were going to kill everyone.
[01:17:35.161 --> 01:17:38.028]  I mean, what do you think about that, my friend?
[01:17:38.861 --> 01:17:43.105]  Uh, well, yeah, that's impossible that they could get all those bombs in there that day.
[01:17:43.145 --> 01:17:43.585]  We know that.
[01:17:43.605 --> 01:17:47.388]  We also know how many kids got killed by men in black that day.
[01:17:48.249 --> 01:17:50.350]  I don't know if there were any shots fired.
[01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:52.792]  By the way, I know Paul Watson's doing an article on this.
[01:17:53.152 --> 01:17:54.013]  Paul, type in it.
[01:17:54.113 --> 01:17:55.234]  CBS News is the one.
[01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:57.656]  I pulled it up when I was at a friend's house a few months ago.
[01:17:57.676 --> 01:17:59.657]  I was telling him about it and he didn't believe it, so I pulled it up.
[01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:00.238]  It's something like,
[01:18:01.345 --> 01:18:03.286]  Hundreds of bombs at Columbine.
[01:18:03.766 --> 01:18:07.367]  And then it's 124 or 126 CBS News headlines.
[01:18:07.787 --> 01:18:09.188]  I think it's 124, memory serves.
[01:18:09.208 --> 01:18:09.748]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:18:10.809 --> 01:18:15.430]  Well, I'm wondering now if we're going to find something like that with this because of the whole bomb thrift.
[01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:16.671]  It's a giant.
[01:18:16.711 --> 01:18:20.432]  Bottom line, it's either a giant provocateur op or it's a pure government op.
[01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:22.221]  Or it's a mental patient.
[01:18:22.241 --> 01:18:33.986]  But do you know, before I even knew about this, last hour when I just had seen the article that it was a mass shooting, I said, if we hear there's multiple shooters, if there's a whole bunch of people shot, if there's any kind of drills involved, or anything before, it's a black op.
[01:18:35.326 --> 01:18:36.907]  And this thing has black op.
[01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:38.728]  Oh my God.
[01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:39.668]  Oh my God.
[01:18:39.688 --> 01:18:41.489]  All of the above, sounds like to me.
[01:18:41.609 --> 01:18:42.249]  Oh my God.
[01:18:42.269 --> 01:18:43.770]  Well, I hope it's not a black op.
[01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:45.350]  It's a lot more scary if it's the government.
[01:18:46.031 --> 01:18:48.812]  But, I mean, we know the DC sniper, that was total black op.
[01:18:49.272 --> 01:18:49.652]  The Jewish
[01:18:51.599 --> 01:18:55.723]  Did you know you have been cheated?
[01:18:55.883 --> 01:18:58.265]  You owe no debt on your bank issued credit cards.
[01:18:58.405 --> 01:18:59.166]  You heard that right.
[01:18:59.266 --> 01:19:01.568]  You owe no debt on your bank issued credit cards.
[01:19:01.748 --> 01:19:02.989]  You don't have to pay them off.
[01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.691]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:19:04.851 --> 01:19:06.292]  Now is the time to fight back.

[01:19:54.225 --> 01:19:56.087]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:56.187 --> 01:20:00.391]  On April 13, 2007, gold spot 68141 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 704.21, 353.94 for half ounce and 170.707 for quarter ounce coins.
[01:20:00.431 --> 01:20:00.831]  That's 704.21, 353.94 and 170.707.
[01:20:13.183 --> 01:20:16.785]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:20:16.825 --> 01:20:19.826]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:20:19.926 --> 01:20:28.990]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:20:29.331 --> 01:20:34.613]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:20:35.093 --> 01:20:37.376]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:39.879]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:43.524]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:43.584 --> 01:20:47.308]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:20:47.348 --> 01:20:47.629]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:47.649 --> 01:20:47.829]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.684 --> 01:20:56.866]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:20:56.886 --> 01:21:00.929]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:21:01.069 --> 01:21:03.631]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:06.032]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:21:06.213 --> 01:21:14.658]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:21:14.718 --> 01:21:16.019]  The Berkeley light is different.
[01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:20.162]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:21:20.162 --> 01:21:20.662]  We're good to go!
[01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:46.115]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.

[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.221]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:53.493 --> 01:21:55.214]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:21:55.374 --> 01:21:56.634]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:56.854 --> 01:21:59.695]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:00.055 --> 01:22:02.836]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:03.357 --> 01:22:10.099]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:22:39.322 --> 01:22:39.522]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:22:39.542 --> 01:22:39.842]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:22:39.862 --> 01:22:40.943]  We all need no education.
[01:23:06.559 --> 01:23:20.483]  Alright, we got Larry Pratt popping in to break down victim disarmament and what should have been done at this school.
[01:23:20.503 --> 01:23:29.886]  I'm going to tell you right now, my children are not going to any of these colleges until they change the gun laws where at least the faculty can be armed.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:31.081]  Period.
[01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:32.782]  And they're not going to any public school either.
[01:23:33.683 --> 01:23:34.684]  So somebody can just go.
[01:23:34.744 --> 01:23:40.189]  I mean, the schools lock it down so your children scrabble like gerbils up against a cage wall.
[01:23:40.569 --> 01:23:41.891]  The windows are all barred.
[01:23:41.911 --> 01:23:43.072]  They got fences around them.
[01:23:43.572 --> 01:23:45.574]  And they've already had cases where people are like, let me out!
[01:23:46.415 --> 01:23:48.917]  And they just walk up and dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[01:23:49.718 --> 01:23:50.639]  You know, the Terminator.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.282]  I mean, this is just absolutely incredible.
[01:23:54.322 --> 01:23:54.863]  By the way,
[01:23:56.053 --> 01:23:56.733]  I mean, it's not.
[01:23:56.893 --> 01:23:57.994]  You just hide.
[01:23:58.014 --> 01:23:59.054]  You run and you hide.
[01:23:59.395 --> 01:24:02.396]  You wait until the person comes around the corner and you at least go after them.
[01:24:02.416 --> 01:24:07.558]  Now, they've had a lot of school shooting cases where the principal has to run out to their car, get the gun out of the car.
[01:24:07.578 --> 01:24:12.821]  Remember, in one case, the principal got fired, went in and took him out.
[01:24:14.001 --> 01:24:16.643]  In another case, went in and just ran the shooter off.
[01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:18.684]  And he didn't get in trouble.
[01:24:19.364 --> 01:24:23.506]  I mean, thank God the principal went and got their gun and took this person out.
[01:24:26.241 --> 01:24:27.802]  Look, it's fine for the police to have guns.
[01:24:27.842 --> 01:24:28.622]  What about us?
[01:24:29.423 --> 01:24:30.424]  We're the good people!
[01:24:34.306 --> 01:24:40.369]  We need to be protected from the postman, and the crazy cops, and the criminals, and everybody going postal.
[01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:45.772]  I mean, every office needs an instant access pistol safe.
[01:24:46.353 --> 01:24:48.034]  A couple of them with trusted employees.
[01:24:48.934 --> 01:24:53.577]  And, uh, you know, if somebody ever busts in here, I mean, folks, I mean, let me tell you this fast.
[01:24:57.348 --> 01:24:59.630]  And I got a 7-shot .357 Magnum.
[01:24:59.670 --> 01:25:01.632]  I go with a revolver because it's simple.
[01:25:01.672 --> 01:25:02.512]  It's not going to jam.
[01:25:02.833 --> 01:25:05.214]  And when I've got adrenaline going through me, it's going to get the job done.
[01:25:05.234 --> 01:25:08.297]  Take the rounds out of it.
[01:25:08.317 --> 01:25:11.019]  And again, folks, I never talk about guns a lot on the air.
[01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:11.960]  I'm just for the Second Amendment.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:13.141]  I've got quite a few.
[01:25:13.161 --> 01:25:14.982]  And I know how to use them.
[01:25:16.323 --> 01:25:17.905]  And you just need to be ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:18.665 --> 01:25:19.866]  See, I'm spinning the cylinder.
[01:25:22.748 --> 01:25:24.650]  You need to be ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:28.330]  And I'm so busy I never get to go to the range three or four times a year.
[01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:29.510]  Everybody needs to do it more than that.
[01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:32.311]  And you need to protect yourself.
[01:25:33.151 --> 01:25:35.371]  I got a .357 Magnum Smith & Wesson.
[01:25:36.091 --> 01:25:37.752]  I bought this after they quit being gun banners.
[01:25:40.112 --> 01:25:52.155]  And again, I don't know how to use the fanciest of guns, but for something for quick defense, this is something I can, at 50 yards, I can shoot somebody in the chest with this.
[01:25:52.913 --> 01:25:57.614]  At 50 yards, I can shoot about a 4 or 5 inch pattern with this handgun.
[01:25:59.614 --> 01:26:00.415]  That's when I'm calm.
[01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:08.876]  But people will tell you in the office, other places you can use a shotgun, but that's something again that's too big, too hard to store.
[01:26:09.776 --> 01:26:14.657]  And the point is, somebody comes around here wanting trouble, I'm not going down without a fight.
[01:26:15.538 --> 01:26:15.838]  Okay?
[01:26:16.498 --> 01:26:22.519]  And I'm not going to live in a filth-bagged state or city where they tell me I can't have this protection I've got in my hand right now.
[01:26:25.505 --> 01:26:30.810]  But again, in those dormitories with your sons and daughters, they're not able to have an incident access pistol safe.
[01:26:31.351 --> 01:26:33.533]  They're not able to protect themselves.
[01:26:33.873 --> 01:26:41.421]  They've got to sit there while some piece of trash, mental patient, drug addict, or government operative, or some mind control victim, and we know that goes on.
[01:26:42.808 --> 01:26:44.890]  They gotta sit there while they have their way with them.
[01:26:45.150 --> 01:26:47.231]  Going back to our guest, Matt Kazee.
[01:26:47.752 --> 01:26:49.673]  Matt, again, you live there on campus.
[01:26:49.693 --> 01:26:50.994]  What area of campus do you live on?
[01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:53.455]  I'm pretty much right in the heart of campus.
[01:26:53.496 --> 01:26:59.640]  I'm about less than a block away from the ROTC dorms and the armory, which is...
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:03.061]  Pretty much less than a block away from this second shooting.
[01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:07.143]  And again, the armory can have weapons, the troops can have weapons, but you, the evil citizen, can't.
[01:27:07.183 --> 01:27:11.325]  Because I know under federal law, any university, you can't have guns.
[01:27:11.345 --> 01:27:17.208]  I guess you've got to live there where you can't have guns while there's multiple shooters running around thumbing at the mouth on a routine basis?
[01:27:17.648 --> 01:27:18.408]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:27:18.808 --> 01:27:19.348]  That's crazy.
[01:27:19.388 --> 01:27:22.790]  Have they announced anything that they have caught him or that he killed himself on the news yet?
[01:27:23.647 --> 01:27:25.148]  Uh, yeah, I think that Bob was just out there.
[01:27:25.168 --> 01:27:27.189]  I think they're saying they killed himself, but they're not sure.
[01:27:27.249 --> 01:27:29.129]  They're could, you know, stay in your homes.
[01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:35.172]  Okay, I just ran up there just while, in between break, and you can tell that it's over.
[01:27:35.212 --> 01:27:37.253]  I mean, it's just a completely different tone.
[01:27:37.313 --> 01:27:39.314]  All the vehicles are still there, but it's over.
[01:27:39.334 --> 01:27:46.257]  You know that they had to, they had so many people there, they had to bring in the local Blacksburg Transit buses to carry them out.
[01:27:47.497 --> 01:27:49.558]  They didn't have enough ambulances.
[01:27:50.948 --> 01:27:54.410]  And I sent you guys a bunch of pictures, actually, that's getting sent right now.
[01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:56.450]  And there are a couple of pictures of that.
[01:27:56.490 --> 01:28:00.052]  And when I get off the phone, I'm going to go back out there and try and photograph it.
[01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:04.914]  And I will find out the story on this guy from local students.
[01:28:05.294 --> 01:28:08.575]  I think, I'm pretty sure he is a student, is what I've heard so far.
[01:28:08.655 --> 01:28:11.617]  But it's still, you know... Do you have a cell phone?
[01:28:11.657 --> 01:28:13.397]  Can you go out on the ground for us out there?
[01:28:13.618 --> 01:28:14.538]  Oh yeah, I sure can.
[01:28:14.718 --> 01:28:19.140]  Tell you what, during the break, give him the hotline, John.
[01:28:21.548 --> 01:28:22.809]  John Harmon, will you give him the hotline?
[01:28:23.269 --> 01:28:24.590]  John's the best doing five jobs.
[01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.750]  Give him the hotline.
[01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:26.531]  Have him call right now.
[01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:27.371]  Let's get him on the horn.
[01:28:27.591 --> 01:28:28.111]  Let's come back.
[01:28:28.131 --> 01:28:28.992]  Talk to our eyewitness.
[01:28:29.212 --> 01:28:30.292]  Then we'll jam some calls in.
[01:28:30.312 --> 01:28:31.413]  Try to get into the rosy news.
[01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:33.594]  Big 9-11 news at prisonplanet.com.
[01:28:33.794 --> 01:28:37.616]  You cannot let what's happening overshadow that important news.
[01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:38.516]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:38.536 --> 01:28:38.957]  Stay with us.
[01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:48.172]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:49.072 --> 01:28:51.833]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.075 --> 01:29:01.718]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:29:01.738 --> 01:29:06.660]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.721]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:29:10.181 --> 01:29:13.523]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:29:14.352 --> 01:29:18.675]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:29:19.115 --> 01:29:22.297]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:29:22.918 --> 01:29:25.800]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:28.681]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:29:28.721 --> 01:29:30.242]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:29:39.288 --> 01:29:39.589]  U.S.
[01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:42.873]  debt bubble red alert and real estate crash.
[01:29:43.214 --> 01:29:46.177]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:29:46.318 --> 01:29:50.743]  That's 1-888-8X-A-N-A-D-U.
[01:29:51.104 --> 01:29:51.845]  Ask for George.
[01:29:55.296 --> 01:29:57.077]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:29:57.378 --> 01:30:00.200]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.942]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[01:30:03.542 --> 01:30:11.848]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[01:30:12.329 --> 01:30:12.869]  An example?
[01:30:13.409 --> 01:30:16.251]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[01:30:17.132 --> 01:30:19.894]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[01:30:20.274 --> 01:30:23.537]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[01:30:24.298 --> 01:30:29.502]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[01:30:30.123 --> 01:30:31.604]  Money is not the problem.
[01:30:31.824 --> 01:30:32.825]  Availability is.
[01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:35.226]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[01:30:35.447 --> 01:30:39.129]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:41.831]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:41.871 --> 01:30:42.972]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:54.701]  Attention gardeners!
[01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:57.103]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:30:57.363 --> 01:31:01.687]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:31:01.888 --> 01:31:09.755]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:31:10.075 --> 01:31:12.916]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:31:13.196 --> 01:31:20.718]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:31:20.818 --> 01:31:26.419]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:31:26.639 --> 01:31:32.200]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.801]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:31:36.041 --> 01:31:39.382]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:31:39.622 --> 01:31:44.668]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Sheet Superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:31:44.688 --> 01:31:47.551]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:31:47.611 --> 01:31:47.792]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:01.264 --> 01:32:03.845]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:06.205]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[01:32:06.285 --> 01:32:09.246]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:32:09.306 --> 01:32:12.987]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[01:32:14.688 --> 01:32:16.989]  Big John.
[01:32:17.469 --> 01:32:19.769]  Big John.
[01:32:20.289 --> 01:32:21.870]  Big Bad John.
[01:32:23.190 --> 01:32:24.091]  Big John.
[01:32:26.363 --> 01:32:28.964]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[01:32:29.024 --> 01:32:31.686]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[01:32:32.186 --> 01:32:35.987]  Didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy, but he spoke it all.
[01:32:36.068 --> 01:32:38.148]  He just said hi to Big John.
[01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:51.955]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans, where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John.
[01:32:53.798 --> 01:33:03.290]  Big John, Big John, Big Bad John, Big John
[01:33:10.506 --> 01:33:13.148]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:13.448 --> 01:33:16.331]  John, Richard, Chris, Paul, everybody's been holding it forever.
[01:33:17.852 --> 01:33:20.654]  And I meant to get to the Rosie O'Donnell news.
[01:33:20.694 --> 01:33:21.655]  Big developments there.
[01:33:21.675 --> 01:33:22.575]  Never really got to.
[01:33:22.595 --> 01:33:24.957]  Getting ready to prison planet because of this shooting.
[01:33:24.997 --> 01:33:28.700]  We're working on getting a report out asking, is this a black op like the others?
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.123]  I mean, if the government's done black ops before, then we know they have.
[01:33:32.723 --> 01:33:35.504]  We got them dead to rights on the Beltway Sniper.
[01:33:36.265 --> 01:33:41.487]  We got them dead to rights on the Buford Furrow and the Jewish School.
[01:33:42.308 --> 01:33:45.569]  We got them dead to rights on Columbine.
[01:33:45.589 --> 01:33:49.951]  I mean, it's just John Lennon, Ronald Reagan.
[01:33:49.971 --> 01:33:51.612]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:33:53.033 --> 01:33:54.554]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:33:54.594 --> 01:33:55.174]  McVeigh?
[01:33:55.674 --> 01:33:57.235]  Definite mind control there.
[01:33:58.619 --> 01:34:02.824]  I mean, his doctor, appointed by the government, was the father of modern mind control.
[01:34:03.145 --> 01:34:07.710]  Jolly and Wes, who just died a few years ago, and was there from the time he got arrested to the time he was executed.
[01:34:08.351 --> 01:34:12.997]  The top head mind control doctor, 1977 MKUltra hearings.
[01:34:13.838 --> 01:34:15.520]  I mean, just unbelievable!
[01:34:18.836 --> 01:34:24.319]  It's just, they think we're so stupid, the public doesn't know there's such a thing as mind control.
[01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:32.384]  Let me tell you, the stuff you saw in Manchurian Candidate, the new one that came out, is exactly, exactly how things bounce.
[01:34:33.384 --> 01:34:35.565]  That's how the ball bounces.
[01:34:36.546 --> 01:34:38.867]  And that's exactly what they can do.
[01:34:40.368 --> 01:34:42.249]  That is so accurate, it is chilling.
[01:34:42.978 --> 01:34:46.961]  But they don't get you in facilities and hop you up on drugs for a week and torture you.
[01:34:47.001 --> 01:34:48.763]  They do it for months or years.
[01:34:48.923 --> 01:34:51.345]  And it works real well.
[01:34:53.907 --> 01:34:54.687]  Oh, man.
[01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.770]  Unbelievable.
[01:34:59.871 --> 01:35:01.653]  I mean, this didn't happen in the past in America.
[01:35:01.773 --> 01:35:03.614]  And you do have some nuts that go kill people.
[01:35:03.654 --> 01:35:05.396]  And you got people that go to their work and kill people.
[01:35:05.436 --> 01:35:07.638]  But you got postal stuff.
[01:35:07.678 --> 01:35:08.398]  Most of that's real.
[01:35:08.418 --> 01:35:10.440]  They go shoot their boss and co-workers.
[01:35:12.316 --> 01:35:17.981]  But this business of going around shooting 50-something people, killing 30-something of them, that's not normal.
[01:35:18.541 --> 01:35:24.106]  And by normal, I mean even in the sick world of mass shootings, that's not what you see in the criminology.
[01:35:25.647 --> 01:35:34.595]  Now, he lives on campus, and he's Matt Kazee, a listener of this show, there in Blacksburg, Virginia.
[01:35:35.365 --> 01:35:36.246]  It is Monday, April 16, 2007.
[01:35:36.787 --> 01:35:42.592]  We are going to be talking about 9-11 and tax time and a bunch of war news, but we're talking about a mass shooting.
[01:35:43.774 --> 01:35:46.676]  Now the real test is, you know they already had a bunch of gun bills prepared.
[01:35:46.716 --> 01:35:49.719]  They've just been introducing last week and will be introducing this next week.
[01:35:49.739 --> 01:35:59.169]  And when they get back in session in the next few weeks, excuse me, they've been preparing bills and having press conferences about bills in the last month, to be more exact.
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:09.825]  And now you're going to see them all introduced to the endless drum beating, so that next time there's a mass shooting, we'll all be totally disarmed and whoever's got the gun can kill 200, 300.
[01:36:11.086 --> 01:36:21.031]  And, uh, during breaks I have been watching CNN and Fox, flipping back and forth, and it's exactly what I thought it was.
[01:36:21.091 --> 01:36:29.735]  It's video and photos of cops, hours into the shooting, while shooting's still going on, standing behind the doors of their patrol cars cowering.
[01:36:30.791 --> 01:36:37.993]  When they knew the basic building, they should have immediately had police charged from all four sides in heavy body armor.
[01:36:39.373 --> 01:36:41.694]  They should have had SWAT teams lowered onto the roof.
[01:36:41.794 --> 01:36:43.074]  They got SWAT teams all over the place.
[01:36:43.094 --> 01:36:43.914]  They all got helicopters.
[01:36:44.154 --> 01:36:46.235]  But these guys got to sit around and plan for hours.
[01:36:47.015 --> 01:36:49.436]  I mean, if you want to do some planning, they've all got armored vehicles.
[01:36:49.636 --> 01:36:55.397]  They should have rammed an armored vehicle right through the front door and gone right in there and killed this person.
[01:36:55.577 --> 01:36:59.138]  But no, they had to wait hours while he walked around shooting everybody.
[01:37:00.516 --> 01:37:03.857]  Four hours and fifteen minutes of Columbine they shot there.
[01:37:03.917 --> 01:37:04.558]  I'm tired of it!
[01:37:06.798 --> 01:37:07.219]  I know this.
[01:37:07.239 --> 01:37:14.661]  If there's ever a mass shooting around here, I mean, back, I mean, back when it happened at the Tower, the citizens just pulled their rifles out and kept them pinned down and stopped them from killing.
[01:37:15.182 --> 01:37:22.924]  He killed most of the people in the first ten minutes and then folks started shooting back and then he only killed about one or two more and wounded a couple because people, the police and the citizens were shooting at him.
[01:37:23.225 --> 01:37:24.465]  Hundreds of people were shooting at him.
[01:37:26.932 --> 01:37:33.733]  Mike Hanson's daddy drove the ambulance right up there and was loading police that had been shot and citizens in.
[01:37:33.793 --> 01:37:39.955]  Literally, it was in the newspaper with flecks of concrete cutting him, hitting him in the face with bullets from that Marine shooting at him.
[01:37:42.075 --> 01:37:49.657]  For those who don't know Mike, he's done work for me for years, runs the TV show, but his daddy, uh, what was his dad's name?
[01:37:49.877 --> 01:37:51.497]  Everybody knows him around town, all the old timers.
[01:37:51.557 --> 01:37:54.298]  It was, uh, it's a German name.
[01:37:54.378 --> 01:37:55.298]  It's, uh, ah,
[01:37:56.384 --> 01:37:57.284]  I can't remember his name.
[01:37:58.405 --> 01:37:59.105]  Otto Hanson.
[01:37:59.125 --> 01:37:59.485]  There you go.
[01:38:02.526 --> 01:38:03.146]  Ah, it doesn't matter.
[01:38:03.646 --> 01:38:05.047]  Otto liked to drive race cars.
[01:38:05.087 --> 01:38:08.508]  He had, you know, they did the drag racing back when the cops wouldn't come after you for that.
[01:38:10.068 --> 01:38:11.949]  And that was back when ambulances drove fast, too.
[01:38:11.969 --> 01:38:13.549]  He liked the ambulances because you had to drive fast.
[01:38:14.230 --> 01:38:14.750]  Otto Hanson.
[01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:18.831]  That's what made America great was the people that were daredevils and liked risk.
[01:38:19.171 --> 01:38:21.592]  Not a bunch of cowards following procedure.
[01:38:22.805 --> 01:38:28.809]  But I guarantee you, folks, if there was some mass shooting and I tried to go down there and go in or go help the police, they'd gun me down and say I was a shooter.
[01:38:28.989 --> 01:38:34.752]  That's how America's changed, ladies and gentlemen, and it's been done by design so the people and the government are at each other's throats.
[01:38:34.812 --> 01:38:35.392]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:38:35.773 --> 01:38:38.054]  Matt Kazee is on the ground.
[01:38:38.074 --> 01:38:42.136]  He's gone down to the area with the police near the shooting where they've got it cordoned off.
[01:38:42.677 --> 01:38:45.698]  Matt, you're there in Blacksburg, Virginia at the campus.
[01:38:45.718 --> 01:38:46.399]  Tell us what's happening.
[01:38:47.139 --> 01:38:50.041]  Yes, I'm standing in the middle of about 200 police cars.
[01:38:50.721 --> 01:38:56.945]  I'm right in front of the building where this happened, and you can tell it's all over, folks.
[01:38:58.926 --> 01:38:59.967]  They've got it under control.
[01:38:59.987 --> 01:39:06.230]  There's still some folks in the SWAT uniforms, a lot of sheriffs and a lot of state police, and not a kid to be seen.
[01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:12.914]  A few folks down here videotaping, some folks wandering around the drill field, but that's about it.
[01:39:13.274 --> 01:39:13.995]  It is pretty much
[01:39:16.292 --> 01:39:20.374]  That school is a giant black op, and it's at a 50% chance or higher.
[01:39:20.674 --> 01:39:22.815]  Everybody's got to get their children out of there now.
[01:39:22.875 --> 01:39:24.375]  Go ahead.
[01:39:24.735 --> 01:39:35.120]  Well, it looks like they still may be treating some people over at the local rescue squad, which just happened to be a half a block away.
[01:39:37.821 --> 01:39:43.023]  But as far as I can tell, they're allowing people... I'm going to try and get up as close as I can here.
[01:39:43.063 --> 01:39:44.024]  What is a half block away?
[01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:46.111]  Uh, the rescue squad.
[01:39:47.051 --> 01:39:50.614]  No, they just hollered at me and said, get out of here.
[01:39:50.634 --> 01:39:52.375]  Well, you know what?
[01:39:52.395 --> 01:39:53.395]  You're a reporter.
[01:39:53.415 --> 01:39:55.076]  Tell them you're a reporter with GCN Radio.
[01:39:56.297 --> 01:39:57.338]  It's far enough away.
[01:39:57.358 --> 01:39:58.398]  They're leaving me alone.
[01:39:58.698 --> 01:39:59.519]  I'm close enough.
[01:40:00.006 --> 01:40:02.709]  I was a little bit, getting a little bit too close there.
[01:40:02.729 --> 01:40:04.751]  Can you go over by the triage center?
[01:40:05.091 --> 01:40:07.233]  Now, now, now, are they bivouacked in an area?
[01:40:07.793 --> 01:40:09.495]  Uh, bringing in the dead and wounded?
[01:40:09.595 --> 01:40:12.538]  Or, or, or, uh, you say, uh, the rescue?
[01:40:13.078 --> 01:40:14.219]  They've gotten most of them out of there.
[01:40:14.259 --> 01:40:19.044]  We, I've got, uh, some pictures of them bringing some dead in where they were covered them, covered them up with sheets.
[01:40:19.644 --> 01:40:22.507]  Uh, they loaded a bunch of people up on a bus, a city transit bus.
[01:40:22.568 --> 01:40:24.810]  You've got pictures, can you email those to Aaron?
[01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:26.992]  I did, I did email some of the pictures that I have.
[01:40:27.032 --> 01:40:32.718]  I believe that some of those are included and anything that I don't, as soon as I get done with this, I will email you guys.
[01:40:32.838 --> 01:40:34.200]  What address did you email them to?
[01:40:35.266 --> 01:40:37.127]  Aaron and Kevin.
[01:40:37.287 --> 01:40:37.767]  That's fine.
[01:40:38.287 --> 01:40:39.468]  Aaron's the place to send it.
[01:40:39.528 --> 01:40:40.908]  Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:40:42.389 --> 01:40:43.469]  Kevin doesn't work here anymore.
[01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:49.612]  So, that is very, very important and I really do appreciate what you're doing, my friend.
[01:40:49.632 --> 01:40:50.892]  You're just doing a fabulous job.
[01:40:51.553 --> 01:40:52.473]  No problem at all.
[01:40:52.533 --> 01:40:54.314]  I can't believe this happened in my backyard.
[01:40:54.954 --> 01:41:01.497]  Well, now, again, it's kind of a rectangle-shaped building.
[01:41:01.537 --> 01:41:02.497]  Where are you right now?
[01:41:03.277 --> 01:41:04.598]  I'm directly in front of it.
[01:41:05.615 --> 01:41:07.076]  Okay, what do you see window-wise?
[01:41:07.096 --> 01:41:08.697]  Do you see any bullet damage?
[01:41:08.737 --> 01:41:09.918]  How many windows are shot out?
[01:41:10.698 --> 01:41:11.859]  Doesn't look like any.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:20.265]  I can see some open windows, but as far as... I do see something that looks like it's been shot out, or at least holes in it.
[01:41:21.325 --> 01:41:22.606]  Sorry, it's pretty windy out here, Alex.
[01:41:22.646 --> 01:41:24.708]  Okay, are you able to get a photo of that?
[01:41:24.768 --> 01:41:25.768]  Are you using a digital camera?
[01:41:25.808 --> 01:41:26.068]  No, I don't.
[01:41:26.429 --> 01:41:29.851]  I do not have my camera on me, but I'm going to... I'm charging my video camera right now.
[01:41:29.871 --> 01:41:30.651]  I'm coming back down here.
[01:41:31.072 --> 01:41:33.193]  Oh, I'm getting... I can't go that way either.
[01:41:34.814 --> 01:41:41.876]  I've got some friends down here who are videotaping too and I'm going to get a copy of that and post all that stuff on my website and I'll be sure and send you guys a link.
[01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:43.436]  Yeah, tell us your website.
[01:41:44.496 --> 01:41:48.097]  TheTruthMovement.net Oh, I know your site well!
[01:41:48.618 --> 01:41:49.718]  Yeah, right on.
[01:41:49.998 --> 01:41:50.818]  We've talked before.
[01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:51.958]  Wow, what a small world.
[01:41:52.518 --> 01:41:54.339]  I know, it's crazy how it all works, isn't it?
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:57.301]  Uh, yes, I'm directly in front of the chapel.
[01:41:57.341 --> 01:41:59.483]  I'm standing here in front of a sheriff who's looking at me.
[01:41:59.943 --> 01:42:02.044]  He's got his, it looks like an assault rifle.
[01:42:02.084 --> 01:42:03.785]  He is eyeballing me big time.
[01:42:04.045 --> 01:42:05.526]  Well, tell him you're on a radio reporter.
[01:42:06.027 --> 01:42:08.548]  I'm far enough away to where I don't, I don't want to talk to him anyway.
[01:42:08.828 --> 01:42:11.510]  Uh, but, uh, I'm still close enough.
[01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:13.131]  I'm way closer than the local media.
[01:42:13.671 --> 01:42:14.832]  They're, they're way back there.
[01:42:15.132 --> 01:42:17.394]  Well, yeah, they've been trained how to cower and follow orders.
[01:42:18.908 --> 01:42:22.250]  Listen, listen, you need to get back immediately to your friends.
[01:42:22.290 --> 01:42:30.614]  You need, as a group together, to go down there and you say, we are with GCN Radio Network, and just say it confidently.
[01:42:30.634 --> 01:42:32.776]  They give you orders, follow them, but just be confident.
[01:42:33.076 --> 01:42:33.756]  Smile at them.
[01:42:34.757 --> 01:42:38.839]  And not in a smart way, but just a nice little smile.
[01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:39.999]  That's how to handle it.
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:43.141]  And I really appreciate you, man.
[01:42:43.161 --> 01:42:44.022]  We got Larry Pratt coming up.
[01:42:44.042 --> 01:42:45.002]  I want to get a few calls in.
[01:42:45.323 --> 01:42:54.809]  Anything else, any other observations you've made, and then I'd like you to go back and get your camera, even if it's got only 20 minutes, get back up there and get the video now before they're able to cover anything up.
[01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:56.109]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:58.991]  I will do that right now, and I appreciate you taking the call.
[01:42:59.151 --> 01:42:59.292]  Sure.
[01:42:59.312 --> 01:42:59.732]  Well, hold on.
[01:42:59.812 --> 01:43:04.615]  As you're walking back, though, towards your house or apartment, is it a house or an apartment?
[01:43:05.427 --> 01:43:06.107]  Uh, it is a house.
[01:43:06.447 --> 01:43:23.532]  Okay, well as you're walking back to your house, just want to be accurate, keep giving us a report on basically any other things that come to mind, any other tidbits, anything you haven't told us about what's happened there locally with the previous shooting a few months ago and the drills and the new speakers they put in right in time for this national spectacle.
[01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:27.165]  Well, they definitely did that, and this is the first time that they've used them.
[01:43:27.905 --> 01:43:32.426]  And we're coming off of the hills of at least four bomb threats in the past week.
[01:43:32.546 --> 01:43:40.068]  And actually, I take that back, it's more, five or six, because there were multiple bomb threats today in the very area where this was going on.
[01:43:40.688 --> 01:43:48.010]  And it looks like there's a bunch of SWAT coming out of one of the side of the buildings right there, and they're walking off.
[01:43:48.630 --> 01:43:50.391]  And everybody, you can tell that everybody
[01:43:51.235 --> 01:43:52.536]  It's much more relaxed now.
[01:43:53.576 --> 01:43:54.577]  I'm walking back to the house.
[01:43:54.637 --> 01:43:57.458]  I'm going to go get my video camera and grab some friends with some ditch cams.
[01:43:58.118 --> 01:43:59.999]  Now let me ask you a question.
[01:44:00.059 --> 01:44:00.919]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:44:01.179 --> 01:44:01.600]  Sure, sure.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.260]  One last question.
[01:44:04.961 --> 01:44:06.942]  Look, I'm talking to a radio show, GCN.
[01:44:07.402 --> 01:44:12.244]  I'm a reporter for GCN and I'm just covering this.
[01:44:12.324 --> 01:44:14.085]  I'm walking back to my house, which is right there.
[01:44:16.847 --> 01:44:17.328]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:18.368 --> 01:44:20.990]  He said I should get to my house and stay in my house.
[01:44:22.151 --> 01:44:24.513]  Um... Yeah, they just want to cover things up.
[01:44:24.533 --> 01:44:25.294]  Don't listen to that.
[01:44:25.614 --> 01:44:26.294]  You live there.
[01:44:26.555 --> 01:44:27.295]  You're with the press.
[01:44:27.836 --> 01:44:29.177]  They haven't cordoned anything yet.
[01:44:29.417 --> 01:44:31.919]  So get your cameras and get back over there and get some video.
[01:44:32.719 --> 01:44:35.782]  Alright, I will do that and I'll call you guys back if I get anything.
[01:44:36.002 --> 01:44:38.864]  Okay, the last question I had that I'd forgotten about with that cop coming over.
[01:44:39.264 --> 01:44:40.745]  Let me try to bring it back up in memory.
[01:44:41.686 --> 01:44:42.667]  Um, is um...
[01:44:43.419 --> 01:44:43.839]  The drills?
[01:44:44.219 --> 01:44:48.362]  Well, we'll talk about the drills, that's always important, how to use the drills as the cover.
[01:44:48.702 --> 01:44:50.563]  But that's why these are so dangerous, folks.
[01:44:50.583 --> 01:44:52.304]  We've always told you, drills are the cover for this.
[01:44:52.804 --> 01:44:53.704]  Let's go back.
[01:44:54.185 --> 01:44:57.506]  If you're having a lot of drills at your school or college, folks, it means you're a prime target.
[01:44:58.207 --> 01:44:59.247]  We've told you this many times.
[01:44:59.627 --> 01:45:02.569]  And again, we're not saying it's a black op, but in my gut, it's looking like that.
[01:45:02.909 --> 01:45:05.771]  And we usually call it right 95% of the time.
[01:45:06.131 --> 01:45:06.871]  I wish I was wrong.
[01:45:07.151 --> 01:45:07.772]  Now go back.
[01:45:08.332 --> 01:45:09.272]  This started at 7.15 this morning.
[01:45:11.363 --> 01:45:25.710]  And it looks like that they didn't even announce until 11 central, noon your time, that it had basically been handled, like 12-15 your time, 7-15 to noon, is 3, 4, 5, 5 hours?
[01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:26.731]  This went on 5 hours?
[01:45:26.951 --> 01:45:27.351]  They couldn't stop?
[01:45:27.371 --> 01:45:31.073]  They started the loudspeakers around 10 o'clock this morning.
[01:45:31.893 --> 01:45:33.133]  Maybe just after 10.
[01:45:33.193 --> 01:45:34.394]  That's a huge story!
[01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:35.214]  Headline!
[01:45:35.994 --> 01:45:42.236]  School didn't start warning loudspeakers for over 3 hours after shooting.
[01:45:42.996 --> 01:45:45.476]  Eyewitness didn't start the new warnings.
[01:45:45.516 --> 01:45:47.277]  This thing's a total... 3 hours?
[01:45:47.297 --> 01:45:47.577]  Be specific.
[01:45:47.617 --> 01:45:48.037]  Was it 10, 10-15, 10-30?
[01:45:54.138 --> 01:45:54.679]  We're good to go.
[01:46:08.656 --> 01:46:26.790]  So, so, Dead Reckoning, well think back, we need to be specific about this, think back to when you got up, did you look at alarm clocks, or what TV show were you watching, or whose show was on, give us a basic time, what time did you hear the big brother tell a scream?
[01:46:28.602 --> 01:46:48.901]  Approximately around 10 o'clock now it could have been 9 30 or something like that I will definitely be thinking I'm a little bit flustered from all this anyway I'm gonna go over my mind and make sure but I know it was not 7 o'clock that's for sure I'm thinking it was around approximately 10 o'clock I think that they started the alarms when the second shooting started
[01:46:50.037 --> 01:46:53.059]  So the guy got away from them.
[01:46:54.259 --> 01:47:00.243]  They detained two people too, but I heard that they let one of them go and they're still holding one for questioning.
[01:47:01.103 --> 01:47:08.447]  And I think that they may have thought that they had it this morning, or for whatever reason, they didn't sound the alarms.
[01:47:10.707 --> 01:47:12.689]  Or maybe not just on my side of the campus.
[01:47:12.749 --> 01:47:14.311]  The first shooting was all the way across campus.
[01:47:14.331 --> 01:47:16.633]  Well, they should have, the media should have been announcing this.
[01:47:17.053 --> 01:47:22.438]  I mean, if somebody drops a stick of bubblegum on the ground, they'll shut down half the schools in Virginia or Texas.
[01:47:23.099 --> 01:47:30.045]  You know, if there's a killer on the loose, or a convict on the loose, now, I mean, think about this, folks.
[01:47:30.585 --> 01:47:44.069]  At least, let's be conservative, two hours after 7-15, I mean that's only 9-15, let's be conservative, for at least two hours they didn't use their news system, they didn't warn the media, they kept this thing real quiet.
[01:47:44.289 --> 01:47:49.271]  I'm telling you this thing stinks like nothing I've ever smelled in the state of Denmark or Louisiana.
[01:47:49.851 --> 01:47:53.355]  Well now Alex, I don't know if the media warned it because I was asleep at that time.
[01:47:53.675 --> 01:47:58.300]  I'll go home and I'll find out right now from their website as to what time it got reported this morning.
[01:47:59.641 --> 01:48:01.984]  I know the way, this is a very small community here.
[01:48:02.304 --> 01:48:04.667]  This campus is exploding.
[01:48:04.787 --> 01:48:08.511]  We're just bursting at the seams with too many people in this little small town.
[01:48:09.311 --> 01:48:16.334]  And word travels fast, so I will go get the timeline down right now, I'll get my video camera charged up, and I'll head back down there.
[01:48:16.654 --> 01:48:19.636]  Alright, call us back then in the next 20 minutes or so, my friend.
[01:48:20.176 --> 01:48:21.477]  Alright, good to talk to you, Alex.
[01:48:21.537 --> 01:48:21.997]  Thank you.
[01:48:22.117 --> 01:48:37.704]  Okay, there goes Matt Kazee, and he runs Merging and Rowing, it's a 9-11 site I visit every week, so just I love all these activists and media, new media people, independent media, alternative media, whatever your term is you like to use.
[01:48:39.332 --> 01:48:42.674]  And my beautiful wife is looking through me to the broadcast window out there.
[01:48:42.894 --> 01:48:43.855]  She's got some breaking news.
[01:48:43.875 --> 01:48:44.335]  Come on in here.
[01:48:44.375 --> 01:48:44.715]  What is it?
[01:48:45.715 --> 01:48:47.436]  Oh, she's just waiting till I come off air.
[01:48:47.496 --> 01:48:48.177]  Is it something hot?
[01:48:49.137 --> 01:48:50.998]  Alright, but you can just run in here with it if you got it.
[01:48:51.879 --> 01:48:54.640]  My wife's always done production for me, but she's doing it full time now.
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:57.682]  So it's good to have her here on board with us.
[01:48:58.502 --> 01:49:00.283]  Why don't you come on in there and come on the air?
[01:49:01.684 --> 01:49:02.965]  Maybe later we'll have you on the air sometime.
[01:49:03.065 --> 01:49:03.445]  Okay, fine.
[01:49:04.486 --> 01:49:05.746]  Look at her smiling into the window.
[01:49:05.766 --> 01:49:06.987]  It's hard for me not to get distracted.
[01:49:09.982 --> 01:49:12.823]  Anyways, this is a horrible shooting.
[01:49:14.243 --> 01:49:14.803]  What do you say?
[01:49:14.843 --> 01:49:15.964]  I want to go to all your calls.
[01:49:16.004 --> 01:49:19.205]  What I'll do is I'm going to come back from break and I'm just going to give each person about a minute.
[01:49:19.245 --> 01:49:20.025]  You've been holding forever.
[01:49:20.085 --> 01:49:23.226]  Richard, John, Bill, Chris, others.
[01:49:24.107 --> 01:49:25.327]  Everybody that's holding.
[01:49:25.347 --> 01:49:29.329]  And then we got Larry Pratt popping in just for about 10-15 minutes about victim disarmament.
[01:49:29.369 --> 01:49:30.229]  This is what it leads to.
[01:49:31.924 --> 01:49:32.465]  It's so weird.
[01:49:32.485 --> 01:49:40.852]  I was on the University of Texas campus yesterday and every 100 yards or so, they got one of these poles that says, call police for help.
[01:49:41.653 --> 01:49:49.280]  And I thought, man, if somebody was running around mugging somebody, I wouldn't run over and put the button and go, help me, help me, oh God, help me.
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:50.881]  I've heard those 9-11 tapes.
[01:49:50.901 --> 01:49:52.583]  They're like, he's got to kill me.
[01:49:52.603 --> 01:49:53.604]  No, no.
[01:49:57.328 --> 01:50:02.811]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:03.172 --> 01:50:10.816]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.494 --> 01:50:18.578]  TerrorStorm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.958 --> 01:50:30.384]  TerrorStorm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.704 --> 01:50:34.226]  TerrorStorm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.

[01:51:50.124 --> 01:52:00.331]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:52:00.531 --> 01:52:05.514]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:52:05.935 --> 01:52:08.556]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:52:09.057 --> 01:52:12.379]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:52:13.206 --> 01:52:17.549]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:52:17.970 --> 01:52:21.172]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:52:21.772 --> 01:52:24.654]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:52:25.395 --> 01:52:27.537]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[01:52:38.164 --> 01:52:38.445]  U.S.

[01:52:42.069 --> 01:52:43.070]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:44.992]  That's 1-888-8X-A-N-A-D-U.
[01:52:45.012 --> 01:52:45.713]  Ask for George.
[01:52:57.622 --> 01:53:01.783]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:53:01.843 --> 01:53:05.804]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[01:53:06.685 --> 01:53:12.226]  Even your emotions haven't let go in so much space.
[01:53:12.346 --> 01:53:20.269]  And when you're out there, was out there, yeah I was out of touch.
[01:53:20.309 --> 01:53:22.749]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[01:53:31.571 --> 01:53:33.092]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:34.012 --> 01:53:37.094]  Larry Pratt joins us, coming up in about five minutes.
[01:53:37.154 --> 01:53:38.074]  Then Aaron Zellman.
[01:53:38.134 --> 01:53:38.855]  Aaron Zellman.
[01:53:39.875 --> 01:53:42.436]  I had remembered some controversy with Virginia Tech.
[01:53:43.037 --> 01:53:44.838]  Virginia has a concealed carry.
[01:53:44.898 --> 01:53:49.800]  Virginia Tech banned guns, brought in the federal law and state law.
[01:53:50.982 --> 01:53:51.282]  There.
[01:53:51.883 --> 01:54:00.588]  And they have brought on their hands, this is out of the Roanoke Times, April 13, 2005, Virginia Tech's gun ban on a made-law legal fire.
[01:54:01.409 --> 01:54:02.810]  And they're murderers, folks.
[01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:03.610]  They are murderers.
[01:54:03.650 --> 01:54:09.734]  And it's not just the government murdering them in absentia or from an indirect way.
[01:54:10.815 --> 01:54:14.397]  This thing has Black Op written all over it.
[01:54:15.091 --> 01:54:17.053]  See, it's got this fog and all this confusion.
[01:54:17.073 --> 01:54:18.454]  I don't know how to even explain it.
[01:54:18.474 --> 01:54:20.136]  It's like, it becomes like an art form.
[01:54:20.156 --> 01:54:21.077]  You just don't know how to look at it.
[01:54:21.917 --> 01:54:24.600]  And, uh, it just, it reeks of black op.
[01:54:27.082 --> 01:54:28.904]  Ugh, and then, it's just amazing.
[01:54:28.964 --> 01:54:29.765]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:54:29.825 --> 01:54:30.665]  Let's, uh, go to them.
[01:54:31.847 --> 01:54:34.129]  And I got the big Rosie O'Donnell news I will spend some time on.
[01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:38.513]  Uh, let's go to, um, Richard in Canada.
[01:54:38.533 --> 01:54:39.293]  Richard, you're on the air.
[01:54:39.333 --> 01:54:39.874]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:40.672 --> 01:54:41.873]  Hey, hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:54:41.913 --> 01:54:42.613]  This is Richard here.
[01:54:42.633 --> 01:54:44.474]  I'm so happy to finally get in touch with you.
[01:54:44.494 --> 01:54:47.656]  It's been a while and I just want to congratulate you.
[01:54:47.716 --> 01:54:49.938]  You're a leader, brave, you're courageous.
[01:54:50.078 --> 01:55:05.948]  I've watched all your documents and actually the funny thing is that when I was waiting on like this breaking news came but what I wanted to tell you was that I actually woke up last year because I am an international student here and I was pulled out of a bathroom stall
[01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:17.824]  By a police officer on campus and I was given no reason why and when I went back in to figure out why in the police station they basically told me they were doing their job and That was it.
[01:55:18.345 --> 01:55:22.190]  I felt like all my rights were taken away and after that like I kind of woke up and
[01:55:22.894 --> 01:55:35.289]  This is why they love mass shootings, because it creates the fear, and now they're gonna have metal detectors and frisk and barbed wire, and the schools will be prisons, and they're shooting at businesses, their prisons shooting at the... It's everything's a prison now!
[01:55:35.630 --> 01:55:38.032]  Terrorists attack an airport, we're prisoners there.
[01:55:38.513 --> 01:55:41.717]  They attack a bus, now we gotta have searches, I mean it's just total control.
[01:55:42.197 --> 01:55:49.660]  It is, and Alex, the funny thing is that I think it's already been done because, like, they knew where I was in that same bathroom, like, the week before.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:52.741]  Like, they told me what I was doing, and I was like, how do you know that?
[01:55:52.841 --> 01:55:55.382]  And they couldn't even, man, they pulled me out of the stall.
[01:55:55.402 --> 01:55:56.943]  They didn't even tell me who they were.
[01:55:56.963 --> 01:55:58.643]  They took all my information.
[01:55:58.683 --> 01:55:59.544]  They took my ID.
[01:55:59.984 --> 01:56:07.607]  I felt so dehumanized, and I actually, I did get some recourse, because instead of going back to the people in authority, I went to the business department, and
[01:56:08.007 --> 01:56:11.908]  I told them what happened, and they got so worried because I threatened to go to the media.
[01:56:12.268 --> 01:56:14.448]  And because they thought I would just sit down and take it, you know?
[01:56:14.508 --> 01:56:16.809]  But that woke me up, and that's what we really are.
[01:56:16.849 --> 01:56:18.989]  Well, you know why they knew what you were doing?
[01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:24.231]  They've got video cameras in most bathrooms now at colleges and high schools and middle schools.
[01:56:24.691 --> 01:56:29.712]  And a lot of times, they've got them in the showers, and the principals trade them amongst themselves.
[01:56:29.732 --> 01:56:30.332]  That's been in the news.
[01:56:30.832 --> 01:56:31.673]  Yeah, and you're totally right.
[01:56:31.713 --> 01:56:36.178]  It's so funny to know that, like, everything's so controlled, yet so many things happen.
[01:56:36.258 --> 01:56:42.385]  Look, if you're in a rest stop or a university or school, and you're on the commode, just know they're videotaping most of the time.
[01:56:42.746 --> 01:56:50.394]  Definitely, and Alex, you're so right, because if they have so much, like, surveillance, how do all these things just appear out of the blue and happen, and they can't control it?
[01:56:50.454 --> 01:56:51.936]  I mean... Well, notice England has...
[01:56:52.456 --> 01:57:00.963]  You know, 14 million cameras just in the surrounding London area, four plus million in London, and that's like 50-something million nationwide.
[01:57:00.983 --> 01:57:02.264]  You can go look the numbers up.
[01:57:02.344 --> 01:57:05.927]  I'm going from memory there, but I know it's four and a half million in London.
[01:57:05.947 --> 01:57:06.848]  That was a couple years ago.
[01:57:06.888 --> 01:57:07.409]  It gets worse.
[01:57:07.689 --> 01:57:14.454]  Now they have telescreens that shout orders at you in a child's voice, and their crime actually exploded with that.
[01:57:14.514 --> 01:57:19.999]  This is so they can carry out their terror attacks and know who saw it and know who could expose them.
[01:57:21.130 --> 01:57:33.979]  So I just want to congratulate you and one day you're going to reach a place that you know all your work is going to pay off and you're going to, people will wake up to what you're trying to say and keep up what you're doing and I'm not even from the states and I'm not from North America.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:39.503]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:44.759 --> 01:57:47.922]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:57:47.962 --> 01:57:52.005]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:57:52.145 --> 01:57:54.687]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:57:54.767 --> 01:57:57.089]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:57:57.269 --> 01:58:05.716]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:58:05.776 --> 01:58:07.097]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:58:07.237 --> 01:58:11.340]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:11.980]  We're good to go!

[01:58:47.643 --> 01:58:49.524]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:58:49.544 --> 01:58:53.705]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:54.905 --> 01:58:55.565]  Big Brother.
[01:58:56.225 --> 01:58:57.266]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:57.986 --> 01:58:59.126]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:59.766 --> 01:59:00.567]  You want answers?
[01:59:01.327 --> 01:59:02.247]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:02.887 --> 01:59:06.548]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:07.069 --> 01:59:11.150]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:32.540]  We're going to get to your other calls.
[01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:35.521]  We've got Aaron Zellman joining us, coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:59:36.382 --> 01:59:39.203]  The founder and head of Jewish Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[01:59:40.951 --> 01:59:49.633]  Larry Pratt, the man who leads Gunners of America, one of the few real Second Amendment organizations in the country, is our guest.
[01:59:50.874 --> 01:59:53.995]  Larry Pratt, we've seen a great tragedy in Out of the Gates.
[01:59:54.055 --> 02:00:02.957]  We know that Virginia Tech had a zero-gun policy and had invoked and brought in federal and state laws, even though Virginia had a concealed carry where you live.
[02:00:03.835 --> 02:00:05.377]  Alex, you're right on the money.
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:39.925]  The sickening ironies of this tragedy is the Virginia Tech president who opposed legislation in the legislature this year that would have opened an exception for concealed carry permit holders to have guns on
[02:00:41.385 --> 02:00:43.446]  And let's explain something to that scumbag.
[02:00:43.566 --> 02:00:48.007]  Criminals and psychopaths are not going to follow the law.
[02:00:48.167 --> 02:00:51.929]  All you do is endanger us, and I'm sick of it!
[02:00:52.689 --> 02:01:02.112]  It's an amazing mindset that assumes that, well, we've said that it's going to be illegal to have a gun on the campus, and so therefore, what's your problem?
[02:01:02.872 --> 02:01:06.053]  It's also illegal to kill 35 people!
[02:01:06.433 --> 02:01:06.893]  Duh!
[02:01:07.493 --> 02:01:09.274]  That one doesn't seem to connect
[02:01:09.734 --> 02:01:26.609]  to these guys and yet the president and I hope these words ring in his ears until the day he dies and preferably it'll be a long time that he spends not being the president of the university well the university is going to be much safer because today that bill died in committee
[02:01:27.592 --> 02:01:29.354]  He said that.
[02:01:29.534 --> 02:01:31.775]  This very piece of trash said that.
[02:01:31.856 --> 02:01:32.976]  Those are his very words.
[02:01:33.036 --> 02:01:36.699]  He was convinced that he was making the university safe.
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:40.883]  He hasn't learned anything from any of our history.
[02:01:41.123 --> 02:01:42.604]  This is amazing!
[02:01:42.644 --> 02:01:51.291]  We've got anti-gun activist university that's had two shooting sprees in less than a year on it, with cops and citizens getting blown away.
[02:01:52.572 --> 02:01:54.774]  Listen, Larry, and I know, we've got to seize this.
[02:01:54.994 --> 02:01:58.495]  One of the things to point out, and you're absolutely right, we must be on the offensive.
[02:01:58.555 --> 02:02:02.937]  We're preparing a media statement that says that the problem at Virginia Tech was that there weren't enough guns.
[02:02:03.097 --> 02:02:04.997]  The thing that we can remind these Jaspers of is that
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:35.464]  Approximately two hours down the road, still in Virginia, in Grundy, Virginia, there's the Appalachian School of Law, which about four years ago was the scene of something rather similar.
[02:02:35.484 --> 02:02:36.645]  We think that the shooter today is a student.
[02:02:43.787 --> 02:02:44.828]  Go on to the campus.
[02:02:45.568 --> 02:02:50.850]  First victim is a professor and obviously intentions of killing lots more.
[02:02:51.390 --> 02:03:03.055]  At the first sounds of the gunshots, two of the law students went to their cars, which of course were off the campus as the law would require because they had firearms in them.
[02:03:03.415 --> 02:03:04.956]  They got their firearms.
[02:03:05.196 --> 02:03:08.337]  They went to the scene of the crime and subdued the killer.
[02:03:09.037 --> 02:03:14.321]  Saving perhaps another mass murder of the proportions that we witnessed today.
[02:03:14.381 --> 02:03:19.844]  But there were none of those students today that were able to do that.
[02:03:20.285 --> 02:03:31.772]  Another school shooting that ended rather prematurely from the shooter's point of view was in Pearl, Mississippi, where the assistant principal was able to go, similar scenario, get his gun, stop the shooter.
[02:03:34.042 --> 02:03:42.405]  No, we've got to wait, like Columbine, four hours and fifteen minutes while the SWAT teams dress up in Darth Vader outfits and do absolutely nothing.
[02:03:42.425 --> 02:03:43.785]  Well, let me just tell everybody something.
[02:03:43.805 --> 02:03:49.607]  Anybody comes in my business, threatening people with a gun, I'm not, we don't call the police, you're gonna die.
[02:03:49.667 --> 02:03:50.187]  We'll be right back.
[02:03:53.823 --> 02:03:59.290]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:59.671 --> 02:04:07.241]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:15.033]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:15.433 --> 02:04:26.878]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:27.178 --> 02:04:31.100]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:33.081]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:33.401 --> 02:04:37.243]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:50.396 --> 02:04:55.497]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:04:55.557 --> 02:05:02.860]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:13.623]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:05:13.843 --> 02:05:18.384]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:05:18.664 --> 02:05:23.667]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:05:23.867 --> 02:05:26.809]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:05:27.049 --> 02:05:36.914]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:05:57.742 --> 02:06:02.463]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:06:02.863 --> 02:06:05.504]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:06:05.984 --> 02:06:09.345]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:06:10.166 --> 02:06:14.495]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:06:14.936 --> 02:06:18.102]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:06:18.723 --> 02:06:21.569]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:06:22.330 --> 02:06:24.471]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[02:06:54.299 --> 02:06:57.101]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:20.316 --> 02:07:21.738]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:21.778 --> 02:07:24.520]  Larry Pratt, the head of Gunners of America, joins us.
[02:07:24.841 --> 02:07:26.843]  And it's hard for him to get a word in edgewise.
[02:07:26.883 --> 02:07:29.425]  I'm so angry about all of this.
[02:07:29.526 --> 02:07:31.327]  I'm tired of these people that come in here.
[02:07:31.407 --> 02:07:33.309]  They've been running our country the last 40 years.
[02:07:33.970 --> 02:07:35.412]  The control freaks.
[02:07:36.433 --> 02:07:38.795]  You know, your children could play out on the street.
[02:07:38.835 --> 02:07:42.539]  They could go out and play on the sidewalk or at the park without fear.
[02:07:43.559 --> 02:07:48.921]  And because we have degenerated with the culture and there are a few more sickos out there, their answer is come take our guns.
[02:07:49.461 --> 02:08:04.345]  And I've been around mainline liberals, folks, and I remember one time I was over at my dad's house when I was in college and one of his friends, the editor of a major magazine, I mean, editor of a national magazine, I'm not going to say which one, he's still there,
[02:08:06.152 --> 02:08:15.477]  You know, friends since I was a little kid was there, and my, for some reason, I was, oh yeah, I was storing my guns there because I was in, you know, college, and I just didn't have a whole bunch of them.
[02:08:15.497 --> 02:08:17.598]  I was still in an apartment, but I didn't have all my guns in one spot.
[02:08:17.658 --> 02:08:31.905]  Point is, I came home, was getting a rifle and a handgun, I was going out to the ranch to go do some shooting with friends, and I'm walking out of my parents' bedroom, and then out, down the stairs to the living room,
[02:08:33.024 --> 02:08:39.049]  And I've got one in a gun case, and the other is in a little .357 Magnum pistol, you know, a little soft case.
[02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:40.550]  And he goes, what is that?
[02:08:41.171 --> 02:08:41.931]  And I said, it's a gun.
[02:08:41.951 --> 02:08:42.832]  He went, oh!
[02:08:43.052 --> 02:08:46.054]  And he was like leaning back on the couch, going, my God, my God!
[02:08:46.255 --> 02:08:48.677]  But he'll see cops all day with machine guns, and he feels safe.
[02:08:49.057 --> 02:08:50.758]  And I went, no, it's no big deal.
[02:08:50.778 --> 02:08:51.319]  They're not loaded.
[02:08:51.399 --> 02:08:52.239]  Oh, they always say that.
[02:08:52.259 --> 02:08:52.880]  I went, no, no, no, no.
[02:08:53.897 --> 02:08:57.098]  They're not loaded, the ammo's out in my car, but it's no big deal if they were.
[02:08:57.118 --> 02:08:58.579]  I've been talking to them since I was a child.
[02:08:59.019 --> 02:09:01.440]  My dad's like, it's alright, here, look, and he got it and unzipped it.
[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:10.903]  He goes, see, it's unloaded, look, and he's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[02:09:21.833 --> 02:09:30.819]  ...to a mindset that is very much a problem and is contributing to a worsening in our country of the perception of guns.
[02:09:30.899 --> 02:09:37.263]  It's the zero tolerance, which it sounds like your editor friend may have been one of the originators of.
[02:09:38.064 --> 02:09:49.171]  If you see a gun, wet your pants, suck your thumb, and just basically be immobile until the big brave man with his bulletproof vest gets there to save you.
[02:09:50.291 --> 02:09:55.812]  It's the most incredible, unhelpless, save-me-from-myself kind of way of thinking.
[02:09:56.632 --> 02:10:02.634]  And it's a very dangerous way of thinking, as we've just seen so sickeningly today at Virginia Tech.
[02:10:03.734 --> 02:10:08.795]  One of the early accounts depicted something that was right out of Columbine.
[02:10:08.875 --> 02:10:19.237]  Students were reported to have been cowering in their classrooms, under their desks, trying to do whatever they could to remain safe.
[02:10:19.992 --> 02:10:25.536]  Well, the best thing they could have done to remain safe would have been to pull out a piece and go get the bum.
[02:10:25.676 --> 02:10:34.502]  And because they were victim disarmed, they should have gone rampage to kick out the wire mesh, you know, like animals in a sinking ship clawing to get out.
[02:10:35.102 --> 02:10:37.043]  They should have been up against the edge of the door.
[02:10:37.264 --> 02:10:40.966]  The minute that person comes in, you just savagely attack them.
[02:10:41.006 --> 02:10:42.967]  I mean, if you can't escape, you might as well fight.
[02:10:43.268 --> 02:10:48.671]  If you're going to take a bullet, you might as well charge the piece of dirt because, well, you might take a bullet.
[02:10:49.432 --> 02:10:49.672]  Duh.
[02:10:50.592 --> 02:11:01.796]  And if you're not going to kneel down while they splatter your brains everywhere, you're going to probably take one in the gut of the shoulder and live, and then others are going to pile on and help you, and that son of a bitch, excuse my French, isn't going to be able to kill you.
[02:11:02.276 --> 02:11:05.297]  Well, that would be what should happen.
[02:11:05.477 --> 02:11:15.960]  It clearly didn't, and the sickening thing, the most sickening thing that I've heard so far, and I'm sure it'll be topped, but was a room full of people that this piece of dirt had gone into,
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.522]  Lined them up and they just stood there waiting to be shot from this early account.
[02:11:21.542 --> 02:11:22.902]  I hope that's not true.
[02:11:23.822 --> 02:11:25.623]  Absolute limbing behavior.
[02:11:25.703 --> 02:11:27.223]  What has happened to Americans?
[02:11:27.644 --> 02:11:34.806]  Once the most feared, upright, individualistic, aggressive people and they've turned us into literal jellyfish.
[02:11:35.535 --> 02:11:38.958]  Well, I think the battle really lies there.
[02:11:39.078 --> 02:11:48.867]  That friend that you so vividly described having his paroxysms of fear on the sofa in your parent's home.
[02:11:48.887 --> 02:11:49.988]  By the way, I wasn't joking.
[02:11:50.468 --> 02:11:53.431]  No, I'm quite sure that was quite accurate.
[02:11:54.152 --> 02:11:57.375]  He probably decided that it was the last time he was going to go to Texas.
[02:11:57.395 --> 02:11:58.516]  They're all nuts down there.
[02:12:01.678 --> 02:12:08.361]  That's the world view that really plays into the hands of the disarmament crowd.
[02:12:08.481 --> 02:12:17.246]  Well, I mean, back when I lived in an apartment, I'd go deer hunting a couple times a year and I'd, you know, and I learned to always even cover the case in a blanket because somebody will see a gun case and go,
[02:12:21.070 --> 02:12:24.935]  Now I know why hunters so typically go early in the morning.
[02:12:25.356 --> 02:12:34.569]  When the sun comes up here I thought it was because that's the best time to surprise Bambi but actually it's because you have to sneak out to the car so none of the neighbors will see you.
[02:12:36.130 --> 02:12:36.790]  I'm not kidding.
[02:12:36.910 --> 02:12:54.275]  I mean, in a free country, even at my house, when I get a rifle out of the gun safe and go to the target range, and a lot of times, you know, they're in there not in cases, I'll grab, you know, my Remington 700, and I go out the back door, I look, I hit the open on the back of my trunk, I lay it in, I'm looking both ways, because, I mean, there's just cowardly jellyfish everywhere.
[02:12:54.455 --> 02:13:03.238]  You know, I had a carpet cleaner at my house about eight, nine years ago, and I had a shotgun before I had children on an open rack up on the wall in my broadcast studio out of my house.
[02:13:03.918 --> 02:13:08.241]  And it was just a cheap defender, pump action, you know, just for defense.
[02:13:08.922 --> 02:13:11.404]  And the carpet cleaner guy goes, is that legal?
[02:13:11.484 --> 02:13:13.825]  And I said, don't call the police on me.
[02:13:14.166 --> 02:13:20.590]  And then later, I had a bad feeling and I called the carpet cleaning place and the owner got on and said, no, I know who you are Alex, don't worry.
[02:13:20.891 --> 02:13:22.111]  Yeah, he did come back.
[02:13:22.512 --> 02:13:24.093]  He did want to call the police on you.
[02:13:24.113 --> 02:13:25.454]  We explained that it was legal.
[02:13:25.994 --> 02:13:30.358]  Well, I mean, they watch cop shows that are set in New York, where they always go, we found a gun in his house.
[02:13:30.598 --> 02:13:32.920]  These people, they believe TV is the real world.
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:45.270]  We found an arsenal, and they'll show you a picture of two or three guns, and that hardly cuts it for an arsenal in my book, but then one gun is an arsenal for these people.
[02:13:45.711 --> 02:13:52.937]  As we're talking about this, the thought has crossed my mind, I am so blessed to have the luxury of an attached garage.
[02:13:53.458 --> 02:14:01.177]  So that I can sneak my guns out into the garage, into the car, without having to draw attention to myself.
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:17.791]  Pity the poor guy like you when you were that student in the apartment that had to leave an apartment and walk down who knows how many flights of stairs and how many hallways so that who knows how many people might see you and absolutely ruin their day.
[02:14:18.051 --> 02:14:28.839]  And again they think all guns are illegal and then Handgun Control Incorporated sworn to dishonor the American people in the words of Sarah Brady so we can have quote socialism that is enforce it
[02:14:29.259 --> 02:14:43.589]  They have these billboards from Galveston, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri that show a revolver, and it says, Report Illegal Guns, but then when you read in real small print, it says, you know, Those Violating Gun Laws.
[02:14:43.829 --> 02:14:49.373]  There's no law against having the revolver, but that's to brainwash the public for the perception it's illegal!
[02:14:49.834 --> 02:14:58.440]  That is the part of the battle that we're fighting, and it's probably a more serious problem that we're fighting than the laws themselves.
[02:14:59.241 --> 02:15:15.158]  If anything, we've seen modest progress at the state level where concealed carry laws have been passed and then expanded, where stand your ground legislation where you don't have to retreat not only in your house but now increasingly out on the street.
[02:15:15.758 --> 02:15:17.560]  Those kinds of laws are very positive.
[02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:20.624]  Also, you might consider that Utah and Oregon
[02:15:21.204 --> 02:15:28.690]  Are the only two states that presently have used a little bit of freedom that was allowed by the federal ban on guns at school.
[02:15:28.891 --> 02:15:43.483]  How do we get back to the point where my dad could, because you know, his mother would, when she was a school teacher, she was teaching at different schools, and when he was at, you know, they would drive him to one spot where the bus would come pick him up in the country, but they go into a pretty big, you know, country school, and they would just
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:44.920]  I don't know.
[02:16:05.789 --> 02:16:07.489]  Yours was a kind of an upscale school.
[02:16:07.849 --> 02:16:11.090]  I've talked to a number of people that didn't have the lockers.
[02:16:11.110 --> 02:16:14.931]  They just put them in the cloakroom alongside of or behind the classroom.
[02:16:15.331 --> 02:16:16.531]  So it was quite open.
[02:16:17.151 --> 02:16:19.032]  It wasn't anybody's personal locker at all.
[02:16:19.552 --> 02:16:21.452]  Anybody could have walked in there and gotten the gun.
[02:16:21.512 --> 02:16:28.174]  And somehow, not only did the gun not go off by itself, but none of the kids went in there and did anything stupid with it.
[02:16:28.414 --> 02:16:34.715]  Now the difference was, though, when you were being taught gun safety, if you did anything that wasn't the total gun safety, you'd get the hell beat out of you.
[02:16:35.035 --> 02:16:36.696]  They'd holler your head off for starters.
[02:16:37.097 --> 02:16:41.580]  You knew that you were in big trouble if you did anything stupid with the gun.
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:52.327]  You feared what the Rangemaster or your dad or whoever was going to do to you a lot more than whatever might possibly be done with that gun.
[02:16:52.768 --> 02:16:56.911]  You knew that something was going to happen right away if you were careless.
[02:16:57.491 --> 02:16:59.773]  So people obviously learned.
[02:17:00.213 --> 02:17:01.574]  It's a pretty good way to learn.
[02:17:02.274 --> 02:17:14.284]  And, golly, we've had members tell us about their trips to the shooting range at school in New York City, taking their cased rifles onto the subway in New York City.
[02:17:15.065 --> 02:17:22.371]  Now, if you think that the guy in the country is going to have trouble walking with his gun today, imagine trying to go to school.
[02:17:22.611 --> 02:17:28.056]  Well, first of all, they don't have those shooting ranges in operation anymore, but imagine what would happen.
[02:17:28.076 --> 02:17:30.338]  They'd probably close off every exit.
[02:17:30.878 --> 02:17:34.984]  Uh, of one of those, uh, subways, uh, if somebody were reported to be doing that.
[02:17:35.044 --> 02:17:38.989]  Now notice how they take the gun ranges away and the schools and suddenly all the shootings start.
[02:17:39.290 --> 02:17:40.592]  Larry, let's get down to brass tacks.
[02:17:40.632 --> 02:17:48.162]  I don't know about this case, but there's definitely been some fishy stuff at Columbine and, and other places where it looks like government's provocateuring are involved.
[02:17:49.085 --> 02:17:58.717]  Well, there was a massive cover-up of the incompetence of the Sheriff's Department in Jefferson County, which is Columbine, out in Colorado, in the Denver suburbs.
[02:18:00.079 --> 02:18:03.964]  So, in fact, it got to be so bad that the Sheriff was not re-elected.
[02:18:04.937 --> 02:18:11.239]  And we keep finding out things that he was trying to cover up just to make his incompetence look like it wasn't so bad.
[02:18:11.259 --> 02:18:15.020]  There were plenty of warnings ahead of time that were neglected.
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:19.581]  And then when the officers got there, there was confusion.
[02:18:19.601 --> 02:18:22.682]  It was kind of risk aversion.
[02:18:22.702 --> 02:18:26.683]  You know, don't have a cop put himself in any risk at all.
[02:18:26.703 --> 02:18:29.504]  So they just waited until everybody was dead and then they went in.
[02:18:31.566 --> 02:18:35.929]  30, 40 years ago, because I've studied the cases, you couldn't stop police from charging in after a gunman.
[02:18:36.489 --> 02:18:41.393]  And that was the impulse, I think, of a lot of the officers there, but they were told, stand down.
[02:18:42.214 --> 02:18:46.617]  And that's what was so terrible about it, and I think that was part of the odor that got rid of them.
[02:18:46.637 --> 02:18:48.599]  Yeah, they're trying to breathe the manhood out of us.
[02:18:48.859 --> 02:18:49.940]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt.
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:53.781]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:18:54.101 --> 02:18:59.023]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:18:59.263 --> 02:19:03.624]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:19:03.925 --> 02:19:12.828]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[02:19:13.048 --> 02:19:16.649]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[02:19:16.949 --> 02:19:21.994]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:19:22.274 --> 02:19:28.981]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:19:29.494 --> 02:19:30.154]  What about you?

[02:19:52.074 --> 02:19:55.757]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:19:56.157 --> 02:20:01.581]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:20:02.042 --> 02:20:03.123]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:20:03.163 --> 02:20:07.146]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:20:07.846 --> 02:20:21.177]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:20:21.197 --> 02:20:26.982]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:20:27.282 --> 02:20:33.167]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:20:33.908 --> 02:20:35.249]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:39.936]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:20:40.377 --> 02:20:40.978]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:41.038 --> 02:20:43.161]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:20:43.181 --> 02:20:43.241]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:51.949 --> 02:20:58.453]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:20:58.673 --> 02:21:02.696]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:21:02.956 --> 02:21:05.117]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:21:05.458 --> 02:21:12.442]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:21:12.802 --> 02:21:15.405]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:21:15.666 --> 02:21:19.190]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[02:21:19.470 --> 02:21:22.373]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[02:21:22.674 --> 02:21:27.339]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:29.221]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:21:29.522 --> 02:21:31.985]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X.
[02:21:33.306 --> 02:21:41.436]  In the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[02:21:41.897 --> 02:21:44.179]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:49.987]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:21:52.066 --> 02:21:52.486]  Attention!
[02:21:52.587 --> 02:21:55.429]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:21:55.709 --> 02:21:59.993]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:22:00.333 --> 02:22:01.013]  Listen closely.
[02:22:01.974 --> 02:22:09.140]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:18.187]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[02:22:18.508 --> 02:22:21.450]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:24.012]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[02:22:24.292 --> 02:22:33.760]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:39.585]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[02:22:39.785 --> 02:22:43.368]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[02:22:43.589 --> 02:22:46.931]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:23:02.017 --> 02:23:04.701]  We've got Matt Kazeeves with 9-11 Truth there.
[02:23:09.242 --> 02:23:11.564]  In Blacksburg, Virginia, he lives on the campus.
[02:23:11.584 --> 02:23:15.848]  He's already been down there for us with a live report with the SWAT teams and people telling him to get back.
[02:23:16.268 --> 02:23:17.249]  He went further than the media.
[02:23:17.289 --> 02:23:18.150]  He's back there now.
[02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:19.431]  We're about to go to him on cell phone.
[02:23:19.951 --> 02:23:22.293]  Larry Pratt at gunowners.org.
[02:23:22.754 --> 02:23:35.545]  Larry, how do we, in a nutshell, get on the offensive and get the truth out that it, again, is victim disarmament, inaction, and that the school needs to be held accountable instead of turning every university in the country into little prison camps?
[02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:42.456]  Well, one thing that Gun Owners of America is set up to do is of course provide a voice for grassroots activism.
[02:23:42.597 --> 02:23:50.466]  We have on our website gunowners.org an email alert system and I can assure you that shortly we're going to be renewing
[02:23:51.107 --> 02:24:01.313]  Our campaign to end this senseless, dangerous, reckless kind of legislation that's on the books right now that prohibits people from defending themselves.
[02:24:01.634 --> 02:24:09.218]  It's okay to defend yourself in most states if you have a concealed carry permit and you're in a 7-11, but God help you if you're on a school grounds.
[02:24:09.679 --> 02:24:12.820]  That's nuts to assume that somehow... Those are the targets!
[02:24:13.001 --> 02:24:14.201]  Now Larry...
[02:24:15.602 --> 02:24:20.104]  I've read the different policies and basically if a shooter is even in the school, they lock down.
[02:24:20.504 --> 02:24:24.426]  That's going to result sometime in 100 plus dead, not just 32 as they're now reporting.
[02:24:25.707 --> 02:24:30.429]  How do we reverse that insane stance of we lock the children in like it's fish in a barrel?
[02:24:32.279 --> 02:24:37.764]  The whole concept, as we were talking about earlier, is rooted in, if you do nothing, you'll be okay.
[02:24:38.185 --> 02:24:40.507]  If you have no defense, that's a good defense.
[02:24:41.348 --> 02:24:42.329]  They're brainwashing us!
[02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:45.371]  You just lay there and take it to go to the FEMA camps, basically.
[02:24:46.132 --> 02:24:53.179]  Just to lie there and take it, no matter what is happening, whether it's government abuse or whether it's a thug like the one at the
[02:24:53.619 --> 02:24:55.000]  Virginia Tech campus.
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:25:01.505]  Thank God at Appalachian School of Law that there were a couple of students who were willing and able to do something.
[02:25:01.765 --> 02:25:12.192]  By the way, one of the things that we should emphasize is the media doesn't like to report the good things that can happen such as the Appalachian School of Law where students with guns
[02:25:12.732 --> 02:25:14.453]  Actually stopped the killing.
[02:25:15.513 --> 02:25:28.457]  They were convinced in the media, we know from one Associated Press editor, oh well, if we start telling people about those young men introducing guns into an already dangerous situation, why that would just be reckless to report that.
[02:25:28.677 --> 02:25:29.817]  And so they didn't report it.
[02:25:29.837 --> 02:25:34.478]  There's a literal, I don't even want to call them effeminate men, because women will stand up and fight a lot of times.
[02:25:34.758 --> 02:25:37.419]  These aren't even, I don't know what to call them.
[02:25:37.439 --> 02:25:39.940]  These are these chicken-necked
[02:25:40.564 --> 02:25:53.114]  Cowardly little twits who never lived in the real world, who live in these little pampered high-rises, I guess, in the big cities, and they want us to all be a bunch of cowards like them, and I'm sorry, it's just not going to happen.
[02:25:53.214 --> 02:26:00.260]  Well, and we know what happens in England after they ban guns there and they have a murder rate and a violent crime rate that shoots off the charts.
[02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:06.181]  The response is, oh, well, we need to ban knives and we need to ban replica guns.
[02:26:06.301 --> 02:26:15.043]  And you can just see them adding to the list of banned items as if, well, the criminals didn't cooperate in getting rid of the guns in England.
[02:26:15.063 --> 02:26:18.464]  In fact, there's twice the number of illegal guns there now.
[02:26:18.564 --> 02:26:20.145]  And their crime rates exploded.
[02:26:20.185 --> 02:26:21.205]  That's the UN's own numbers.
[02:26:21.665 --> 02:26:22.866]  Absolutely correct.
[02:26:23.006 --> 02:26:24.807]  That is the source of that.
[02:26:24.847 --> 02:26:29.189]  The worst of all 18 industrialized countries in the U.N.
[02:26:29.209 --> 02:26:30.429]  study, England.
[02:26:30.649 --> 02:26:32.150]  The highest violent crime rate.
[02:26:32.170 --> 02:26:33.271]  Worst of the United States.
[02:26:33.331 --> 02:26:36.312]  Larry Pratt, check in with us tomorrow if you can, briefly.
[02:26:36.612 --> 02:26:37.633]  Sher, give out the website.
[02:26:37.913 --> 02:26:44.876]  Gunowners.org is the place to go for the action, folks, and hopefully you'll do that because we'll be sending out an alert on this soon enough.
[02:26:44.896 --> 02:26:46.557]  And it's clear that we've got to mobilize.
[02:26:46.577 --> 02:26:50.639]  This is going to be the starting gun, pun intended, for a new attack on the Second Amendment.
[02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:56.427]  Absolutely, and I'm glad you've triggered our defense if you'll let me continue that line of discussion.
[02:26:57.471 --> 02:26:58.752]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[02:26:58.792 --> 02:27:01.173]  We really appreciate you, and we'll talk to you tomorrow, sir.
[02:27:01.393 --> 02:27:01.794]  Godspeed.
[02:27:02.014 --> 02:27:02.414]  Thank you.
[02:27:02.434 --> 02:27:03.274]  There goes Larry Pratt.
[02:27:03.314 --> 02:27:06.696]  Okay, let's go to Matt Kazee.
[02:27:06.736 --> 02:27:09.177]  We'll have Jack Blood popping in briefly, too, if he can, in the next segment.
[02:27:09.197 --> 02:27:12.419]  Then we've got Aaron Zellman coming on, JPFO.org.
[02:27:12.739 --> 02:27:17.121]  Matt Kazee is a 9-11 Truth-er, runs a powerful 9-11 Truth website, lives on the campus.
[02:27:17.362 --> 02:27:19.423]  He's marched back down there, this time with a video camera.
[02:27:19.583 --> 02:27:22.424]  We've got some of the photos he sent us up on JonesReport.com right now.
[02:27:22.664 --> 02:27:23.605]  He's going to be sending us more.
[02:27:24.605 --> 02:27:27.387]  Matt, they're reporting 4G, CNN, radio.
[02:27:27.447 --> 02:27:29.028]  What exactly are you seeing now?
[02:27:29.548 --> 02:27:31.990]  Well, actually, I haven't gotten all the way down there.
[02:27:32.010 --> 02:27:36.752]  I had to charge my camera, but what I do have is a timeline, and that is a very important thing with this.
[02:27:37.433 --> 02:27:42.776]  By 9 o'clock this morning, people who were getting to work on campus were immediately told what was going on.
[02:27:43.276 --> 02:27:49.340]  The alert email went out at 955, I believe, is when they sounded the alarm.
[02:27:51.101 --> 02:27:53.162]  Okay, an alert email at what time?
[02:27:56.884 --> 02:27:58.184]  955.
[02:27:56.904 --> 02:27:58.184]  955, and where are you getting this timeline?
[02:27:59.225 --> 02:28:03.106]  I've got a copy of the emails that were sent out across the campus.
[02:28:03.466 --> 02:28:07.767]  Do me a favor, send that immediately to AaronInfoWars.com.
[02:28:07.807 --> 02:28:08.407]  You are the best.
[02:28:09.408 --> 02:28:10.688]  Right on, no problem at all.
[02:28:11.541 --> 02:28:15.723]  All the most important thing that I found out was the bomb threats Friday the 13th.
[02:28:15.843 --> 02:28:20.565]  The bomb threats were at Torgerson, Durham, and Whittemore Halls.
[02:28:20.765 --> 02:28:23.766]  There's always Satanism and Nazism tied into these.
[02:28:24.106 --> 02:28:28.648]  Columbine, the little ADL controlled, he fits that M.O.
[02:28:30.009 --> 02:28:32.089]  Well, that was a fellow up in Minnesota.
[02:28:32.189 --> 02:28:32.810]  We've got a break.
[02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:34.430]  Stay there, we'll come right back to you.
[02:28:34.690 --> 02:28:36.191]  Then we've got Aaron Zellman coming on.
[02:28:36.471 --> 02:28:37.872]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:28:40.882 --> 02:28:43.867]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:28:44.808 --> 02:28:47.473]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:52.972 --> 02:28:57.116]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:28:57.336 --> 02:28:59.098]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:28:59.358 --> 02:29:05.644]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:29:05.944 --> 02:29:12.070]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:14.152]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:14.852]  I think so.
[02:29:36.798 --> 02:29:37.458]  We're good to go.
[02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:10.375]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:30:10.655 --> 02:30:13.318]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:30:13.939 --> 02:30:18.224]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:30:18.425 --> 02:30:22.690]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:27.454]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:30:27.754 --> 02:30:32.018]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:30:32.338 --> 02:30:38.223]  You will receive information regarding America in Prophecy, Tyrants and Wars, The New World Order, and much more.
[02:30:38.523 --> 02:30:40.966]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:30:41.166 --> 02:30:41.986]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:30:42.006 --> 02:30:43.348]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:30:50.678 --> 02:30:54.959]  Everyone knows we need calcium and magnesium every day for the support of strong bones.
[02:30:55.179 --> 02:30:59.900]  But most of us are only taking one source of calcium supplementation and one source of magnesium.
[02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:08.542]  That just simply isn't enough to give your body the proper nutrition it needs to help keep bones and teeth strong, prevent osteoporosis, and support muscle function.
[02:31:08.762 --> 02:31:13.103]  Now discover the most advanced calcium and magnesium supplement on the market today.
[02:31:13.584 --> 02:31:14.444]  Select Cal 1000.
[02:31:15.524 --> 02:31:23.769]  From the folks who brought you Wachter's Sea Vegetation, Select-Cal 1000 contains 7, that's 7 sources of calcium and 4 sources of magnesium.
[02:31:24.129 --> 02:31:31.493]  Wachter's Select-Cal 1000 is also packed with other important vitamins and minerals, and of course, Wachter's special blend of sea vegetation.
[02:31:31.713 --> 02:31:34.034]  Try finding that in your ordinary calcium supplement.
[02:31:34.154 --> 02:31:41.038]  Order Select-Cal 1000 today and receive 10% off just by mentioning you heard it on the radio in the comments portion of the order page.
[02:31:41.278 --> 02:31:42.599]  Visit wachters.com.
[02:31:42.679 --> 02:31:44.200]  That's W-A-C-H
[02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:47.181]  Strange days have called us Strange days have brought us down
[02:32:19.761 --> 02:32:37.695]  Strange days have found us.
[02:32:37.715 --> 02:32:38.956]  Strange days.
[02:32:44.037 --> 02:32:50.682]  We're going to finish up with our man on the ground who I want to give us a report at the very end of the show again if he can.
[02:32:50.942 --> 02:32:51.603]  He's about to march.
[02:32:51.723 --> 02:32:52.644]  He's right on campus.
[02:32:52.664 --> 02:32:54.905]  He went up there and he heard the police told him to get back.
[02:32:54.945 --> 02:32:58.788]  He went hundreds of yards past the media right up to the place where the shootings happened.
[02:32:59.088 --> 02:33:02.731]  He was trying to get more video and photos of the bullet holes and the damage.
[02:33:03.151 --> 02:33:06.514]  The cops are trying obviously to control their crime scene and not have that be seen.
[02:33:07.475 --> 02:33:08.676]  But he's not in the crime scene.
[02:33:08.696 --> 02:33:10.417]  He's up there trying to get documentation of it.
[02:33:10.717 --> 02:33:11.778]  He's going up there with another team.
[02:33:11.798 --> 02:33:12.418]  He's a known 9-11 truther.
[02:33:13.940 --> 02:33:17.503]  Uh, does a great job, and uh, he's Matt Kazee.
[02:33:17.903 --> 02:33:21.226]  Then we've got Larry, well we just had Larry Pratt on the Gun Owners of America.
[02:33:21.246 --> 02:33:27.172]  Uh, Aaron Zellman of Fugitive Preservation of Firearms Ownership, who's already been all over this victim disarmament school.
[02:33:27.853 --> 02:33:30.875]  Um, is here to let everybody know who is the real, uh,
[02:33:32.103 --> 02:33:37.886]  accomplices to this, and it's the school, it's the system, it's the victim disarmament crowd who must be defeated, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:38.267 --> 02:33:48.753]  And we have the majority of Americans, we have the Constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we've been winning the fight, at least for the hearts and minds, but the government's been kind of going underground with its attack on the Second Amendment, and doing it covertly now, but more than ever.
[02:33:48.993 --> 02:33:50.574]  So to give us an update, here's Aaron Zellman.
[02:33:51.094 --> 02:33:52.837]  Of course, Jack Blythe's got some new developments.
[02:33:52.857 --> 02:33:54.238]  The talk show comes on right after me.
[02:33:54.278 --> 02:33:56.521]  He's going to be popping in here in just a second.
[02:33:57.122 --> 02:34:05.512]  But going back to Matt on the ground right now in Blacksburg, Virginia, as this unfolds.
[02:34:06.013 --> 02:34:07.975]  Matt, you've got the timeline.
[02:34:07.995 --> 02:34:09.337]  You have the internal school emails.
[02:34:09.637 --> 02:34:11.558]  Because you're part of the school there.
[02:34:11.578 --> 02:34:11.999]  You've got these.
[02:34:12.019 --> 02:34:14.220]  You're sending them right now to AaronInfoWars.com.
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:21.305]  We'll get those into the article that Paul Watson, Steve Watson, and Aaron Dykes that works here are all working together as a team on.
[02:34:21.585 --> 02:34:25.908]  Right now they'll be out on PrisonPlanet.com, the definitive analysis of this within the next hour.
[02:34:26.629 --> 02:34:28.010]  But please continue.
[02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:29.251]  You said you have the timeline.
[02:34:29.271 --> 02:34:35.415]  Can you read us that email and then can you go through what you now know about some of the things you're trying to say?
[02:34:36.407 --> 02:34:40.290]  Well, Alex, to end the break, I've got my camera, what was charged up on, and I'm heading down there.
[02:34:40.310 --> 02:34:41.351]  I'm almost there right now.
[02:34:42.312 --> 02:34:43.753]  Were you able to send us the email first?
[02:34:44.673 --> 02:34:49.137]  I was not able to send the email, but I'm going to send that as soon as I walk through the door.
[02:34:49.217 --> 02:34:49.997]  Excellent job.
[02:34:50.017 --> 02:34:50.257]  Okay.
[02:34:52.359 --> 02:34:53.760]  I'm right down here at the scene right now.
[02:34:53.940 --> 02:35:05.829]  What I did find out was that the bomb threats that had the second of the two last week that happened on Friday the 13th, it happened at the buildings that were surrounding the building where the shooting was.
[02:35:06.850 --> 02:35:12.714]  Which I thought that was before, early during the week too.
[02:35:15.896 --> 02:35:19.819]  I'm actually walking to, it has cleaned out a lot since the last time I was down here.
[02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:27.384]  So just in roughly 40 minutes, you were down there and SWAT teams were coming out and they were still milling around.
[02:35:27.404 --> 02:35:28.665]  There were officers everywhere.
[02:35:28.945 --> 02:35:31.467]  What do you see there now at the main shooting area?
[02:35:32.228 --> 02:35:34.591]  Not half as many people standing outside.
[02:35:34.871 --> 02:35:35.952]  The vehicles are still here.
[02:35:36.633 --> 02:35:38.615]  I'm walking through with my video camera right now.
[02:35:39.536 --> 02:35:45.643]  Now, have they hauled out the 32 dead bodies, or are they... Yes, they did.
[02:35:45.743 --> 02:35:47.565]  So they just started that crime scene, alright.
[02:35:47.585 --> 02:35:53.131]  Well, I mean, they obviously tried to resuscitate some of them, but that's still... Some of the dead people are obviously dead, shouldn't have been moved.
[02:35:53.757 --> 02:35:58.043]  Well, I'm sure I'm not sure about all of the dead people, but I saw them removing a lot of people.
[02:35:58.704 --> 02:36:01.708]  There were some people getting pointed at because I got a camera here.
[02:36:01.748 --> 02:36:03.430]  He's telling me to get to the other side.
[02:36:05.533 --> 02:36:09.538]  But making famous right here anyway.
[02:36:11.217 --> 02:36:13.058]  It looks like they did pull out some dead.
[02:36:13.098 --> 02:36:16.919]  I saw some people with sheets over top of their heads when they were coming out.
[02:36:16.959 --> 02:36:20.941]  They took them to the local rescue squad and then various ambulances took them to the hospital.
[02:36:21.401 --> 02:36:23.882]  And then they did bring in a couple of buses, some of them.
[02:36:24.302 --> 02:36:32.204]  They did fill up a bus to some degree with wounded people.
[02:36:34.562 --> 02:36:36.545]  Well, I'll tell you what, Matt.
[02:36:36.585 --> 02:36:37.526]  You're multitasking.
[02:36:37.706 --> 02:36:39.709]  Keep the phone on, but just put it in your pocket.
[02:36:40.650 --> 02:36:43.413]  And then start trying to get some footage, because you're multitasking.
[02:36:43.954 --> 02:36:45.596]  And we're going to go back to you in about 10 minutes.
[02:36:45.636 --> 02:36:47.138]  Can you stay on the line, Matt?
[02:36:49.056 --> 02:36:49.556]  No problem.
[02:36:49.916 --> 02:36:51.477]  Okay, we're going to come right back to you.
[02:36:51.777 --> 02:36:55.239]  Now, I've got to go to Aaron Zellman here quickly, but Jack Blood has been watching and tracking this.
[02:36:55.859 --> 02:37:01.802]  Within 20 minutes of this news breaking, he told me, and I hope we get tape of this, Fox News is already calling for gun control.
[02:37:02.102 --> 02:37:05.244]  The bastion of conservatism now backing Hillary.
[02:37:05.304 --> 02:37:08.565]  We broke it here first three years ago, now been public the last year.
[02:37:08.605 --> 02:37:10.126]  They're really behind the Hillary campaign.
[02:37:10.406 --> 02:37:11.787]  Pure evil neocons.
[02:37:13.127 --> 02:37:14.208]  Jack Blood, what's going on there?
[02:37:15.225 --> 02:37:25.167]  Well, right now we've just got breaking news, Alex, that this is the work of an Asian man in his 20s, heavily armed, wearing a vest, looking for his girlfriend, according to Fox News.
[02:37:25.207 --> 02:37:35.469]  By the way, Fox News, the bastion of phony conservative news, 20 minutes after this story hit the wire, was already having their pundits on, calling for gun control.
[02:37:37.009 --> 02:37:38.090]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:37:38.890 --> 02:37:43.511]  And, you know, I think one of the biggest things here is the two-hour time lapse at 8 a.m.
[02:37:44.824 --> 02:37:48.386]  Let's be clear, they know this guy is going around killing people at 7 in the morning,
[02:38:06.237 --> 02:38:10.540]  She goes on, Alex, to say they had us under lockdown, they temporarily lifted the lockdown, and the gunman shot again.
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:11.061]  They're also
[02:38:21.448 --> 02:38:28.397]  Well, we saw the last guy who was Muslim from Central Asia shooting a bunch of people in a mall and that was shut down really quick.
[02:38:37.629 --> 02:38:39.811]  Alex, I have a ton of coverage on this.
[02:38:39.851 --> 02:38:43.753]  We're going to continue the coverage live on GCN, continually following the story.
[02:38:43.773 --> 02:38:51.479]  I invite your listeners to join us, to call into the program, and to give us any analysis or any news that they have by monitoring the cable news outlets.
[02:38:51.699 --> 02:38:55.782]  We'll do that, Jack, and I'll call in as you're doing that if anything else develops that you don't catch.
[02:38:55.822 --> 02:38:56.482]  Thank you for the help.
[02:38:56.502 --> 02:38:56.943]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:38:56.963 --> 02:38:57.263]  Great job.
[02:38:57.483 --> 02:38:57.944]  You bet.
[02:38:58.024 --> 02:38:59.526]  I think we've got a big story coming out on this.
[02:38:59.826 --> 02:39:10.920]  Aaron Zellman, I meant to get into a bunch of big 9-11 developments today, and we'll do that before the show ends, but I appreciate you coming on on such short notice and holding during our eyewitness account, and then Jack has been covering things.
[02:39:11.761 --> 02:39:13.924]  It's JPFO.org.
[02:39:13.964 --> 02:39:14.705]  God bless you, sir.
[02:39:14.725 --> 02:39:15.366]  Thanks for being here.
[02:39:15.386 --> 02:39:16.347]  My pleasure.
[02:39:17.482 --> 02:39:19.624]  I notice, as usual, you're on top of things years before.
[02:39:19.724 --> 02:39:23.567]  You have attacked the head of this university for victim disarmament.
[02:39:23.807 --> 02:39:25.709]  You have said it's a disaster waiting to happen.
[02:39:26.049 --> 02:39:26.910]  You have written about it.
[02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:27.610]  You have covered it.
[02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:32.814]  You emailed us with a lot of documents and news articles back from 2005 when you were exposing this.
[02:39:33.415 --> 02:39:35.677]  So I guess here you tried to save some people.
[02:39:36.117 --> 02:39:43.603]  And would you say that the people that disarmed the victims there are at least accessories to manslaughter?
[02:39:44.947 --> 02:39:50.988]  The blood is definitely on their hands, and they really don't seem to care very much.
[02:39:51.028 --> 02:39:55.129]  They're going to find a way to whitewash it.
[02:39:55.189 --> 02:39:57.729]  That would not surprise me at all, if that happens.
[02:39:58.650 --> 02:40:03.851]  In the state of Virginia, you are allowed to get a concealed carry permit.
[02:40:04.851 --> 02:40:10.892]  So I'm assuming that the Virginia University said, well, students can't have guns on campus.
[02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:16.391]  Yes, I have a news article right here out of the Roanoke newspaper.
[02:40:16.771 --> 02:40:19.432]  Virginia Tech's ban on guns may draw legal fire.
[02:40:19.452 --> 02:40:25.453]  Some people question whether the university has the authority to ban the carrying of firearms.
[02:40:26.053 --> 02:40:26.933]  Well, there you go.
[02:40:26.974 --> 02:40:34.455]  So the blood is on the hands of everybody in the administration of that university, and I hope they get sued into oblivion.
[02:40:36.016 --> 02:40:41.657]  I hope their lives are destroyed for allowing someone to come in there and murder American students.
[02:40:43.476 --> 02:40:56.341]  I have no sympathy for anybody who works at a university administration level who thinks that they're an elitist, or who believes they are, who doesn't think that the little peons, the students, have a right to defend their life.
[02:40:57.502 --> 02:40:59.783]  These people should be put against a wall and executed.
[02:41:01.103 --> 02:41:04.545]  Well, that's what they certainly did by fiat to these students.
[02:41:06.105 --> 02:41:06.686]  Absolutely.
[02:41:06.766 --> 02:41:11.067]  And I think that this is a... I think that there's some other strange things about this.
[02:41:11.127 --> 02:41:12.508]  As you know, the Parker decision
[02:41:13.231 --> 02:41:14.131]  In Washington, D.C.
[02:41:14.171 --> 02:41:18.373]  had to do with people being able to have a gun in their home to defend their life.
[02:41:19.553 --> 02:41:23.474]  Notice how this is... Notice how this... I think we're on the same wavelength.
[02:41:23.814 --> 02:41:28.856]  But you see, there's also been calls in Congress for more gun control schemes.
[02:41:29.396 --> 02:41:29.616]  H.R.
[02:41:30.236 --> 02:41:33.617]  1022, oddly enough, is the name of the bill, number of the bill.
[02:41:34.117 --> 02:41:42.160]  So all of a sudden you have people pushing gun control, you have people reacting to something favorable about gun ownership, and then you have this tragedy.
[02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:43.921]  It really smells to me.
[02:42:01.974 --> 02:42:03.555]  Well, I think that's my point.
[02:42:03.635 --> 02:42:08.018]  If you think about it, there was a situation similar to this in Canada not too long ago, and a couple years ago in Australia.
[02:42:26.365 --> 02:42:28.828]  Which started a big push for gun control in Australia.
[02:42:28.848 --> 02:42:29.629]  Yeah, Tasmania.
[02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:34.516]  And so, I uh, this thing just smells for me.
[02:42:34.556 --> 02:42:38.501]  I'm urging every gun owner to just dig their heels in and say, hell no.
[02:42:38.762 --> 02:42:40.584]  Hey listen, we gotta get on the offensive.
[02:42:41.405 --> 02:42:41.545]  I agree.
[02:42:41.565 --> 02:42:42.506]  We've got to get on the offensive.
[02:42:42.626 --> 02:42:47.750]  Everyone, call every talk show today, and let's get the United Front Out headline.
[02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:51.133]  Everybody write your own emails, your own blogs, your own MySpaces.
[02:42:51.573 --> 02:43:06.085]  The people that had this be a zero-gun school, even after they'd had another big public shooting a few months ago there, and they just put in loudspeakers and all this weird stuff, and they had drills at the very building that got attacked earlier this week.
[02:43:06.525 --> 02:43:10.407]  I mean, Aaron, this thing stinks to high heaven like a beasel on deal.
[02:43:10.427 --> 02:43:12.428]  You know, we know now Putin pulled that off.
[02:43:12.768 --> 02:43:16.991]  I think that every one of your listeners has to make a commitment to themselves.
[02:43:17.071 --> 02:43:22.794]  Any politician who supports gun control schemes must have their career aborted.
[02:43:24.035 --> 02:43:25.335]  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[02:43:26.376 --> 02:43:29.538]  Aaron Zelman, continue with your analysis on what's happened here.
[02:43:30.698 --> 02:43:35.861]  Well, I think, again, as we've been talking about from what little I know based on some of the information on the Internet,
[02:43:36.676 --> 02:44:03.983]  that you have a situation where uh... apparently an Asian student that they claim he's Asian uh... went in there looking for his girlfriend uh... had some kind of personal issue going on according to the article I read he lined students up and systematically murdered them one at a time uh... so we have a situation here where again students were left defenseless because of the dictates of the people who run the school and uh...
[02:44:05.624 --> 02:44:11.205]  If justice is ever going to be done, the president of this university has to go to prison.
[02:44:11.806 --> 02:44:13.466]  Nothing less than that.
[02:44:13.546 --> 02:44:24.269]  Would you put your son or daughter, and this isn't just a question for Aaron, but I wanted to answer it, in a place where you know it's a target of nutballs or government ops or anything else, where you knew they couldn't defend themselves?
[02:44:25.349 --> 02:44:26.069]  No, I would not.
[02:44:26.909 --> 02:44:28.229]  There is a problem here, though.
[02:44:28.350 --> 02:44:32.491]  There's a lot of university campuses that don't allow students to carry weapons.
[02:44:32.551 --> 02:44:32.991]  No, I know.
[02:44:35.202 --> 02:44:37.123]  You know, we're rockin' a hard place.
[02:44:37.503 --> 02:44:40.425]  If you want your kid to go to college, what do you do?
[02:44:40.465 --> 02:44:42.006]  You can't homeschool them at that point.
[02:44:43.007 --> 02:44:53.053]  So this is a situation where everybody listening has got to decide that if they have kids in school, can't defend themselves, it's time to do something about the administration of that school.
[02:44:54.794 --> 02:44:55.435]  Absolutely.
[02:44:55.535 --> 02:44:58.917]  And for these people to retire on a fat pension, they have to go.
[02:44:59.277 --> 02:45:00.558]  Bottom line here,
[02:45:02.925 --> 02:45:04.626]  You smell a giant stinking rat.
[02:45:04.666 --> 02:45:06.886]  You think this is suspicious?
[02:45:06.906 --> 02:45:12.308]  Even Rush Limbaugh said years ago, I heard him, you know, it's always perfect timing right when they get ready for a new gun push.
[02:45:12.508 --> 02:45:13.568]  There'll be a screen.
[02:45:13.828 --> 02:45:15.348]  There'll probably be a bunch of copycats now.
[02:45:16.229 --> 02:45:17.349]  Oh, I have no doubt about it.
[02:45:17.689 --> 02:45:19.049]  I think this thing really stinks.
[02:45:19.129 --> 02:45:31.873]  I think the Parker decision really got them going because if you listen to what the gun haters have been saying, they're in shock that somehow the government's going to recognize
[02:45:32.689 --> 02:45:35.610]  That gun ownership is an individual right, not a collective right.
[02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:45.472]  Well, Aaron, we've real conservative, I don't mean the fake George Bush conservative listeners, but real conservative issues of Second Amendment, border control, anti-abortion, pro-life.
[02:45:46.073 --> 02:45:49.594]  We're in polls gaining feet every day.
[02:45:50.774 --> 02:45:54.915]  Now that doesn't mean the government's moving, but they see us moving, and yeah, they're panicking, Aaron.
[02:45:55.275 --> 02:45:55.895]  Absolutely.
[02:45:56.015 --> 02:45:58.816]  I think you're going to see more situations like this.
[02:45:59.705 --> 02:46:03.249]  And so I'm telling people, dig your heels in, get prepared.
[02:46:03.650 --> 02:46:04.791]  Things are going to get dicey.
[02:46:05.832 --> 02:46:15.003]  Remember Alex, a couple years ago I told you, you laughed at me, but I said, don't be surprised if there are not elections, presidential elections.
[02:46:16.624 --> 02:46:17.906]  Let's just see what happens.
[02:46:18.502 --> 02:46:20.983]  Just put it on the back burner and let it simmer.
[02:46:21.323 --> 02:46:22.063]  No, I wasn't lying.
[02:46:22.083 --> 02:46:23.183]  That might have been another host.
[02:46:23.623 --> 02:46:24.124]  All right, okay.
[02:46:24.244 --> 02:46:26.284]  Aaron, you might have... I mean, I know you were... Are you kidding?
[02:46:26.344 --> 02:46:28.965]  I write articles about... Ron Paul's on the show last week.
[02:46:29.465 --> 02:46:31.686]  Ron Paul said they're gearing up for martial law right now.
[02:46:32.186 --> 02:46:32.566]  Of course.
[02:46:33.766 --> 02:46:35.287]  So I wouldn't plan on elections.
[02:46:35.307 --> 02:46:37.787]  I think all this is just bread and circuses.
[02:46:39.408 --> 02:46:41.408]  What, you think it's just going to crescendo and build?
[02:46:42.309 --> 02:46:43.469]  Well, if they can make it happen.
[02:46:44.639 --> 02:46:47.039]  That's why I think your listeners have got to get ready.
[02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:48.780]  They've got to have their wits about them.
[02:46:49.740 --> 02:46:50.840]  Well, everybody feels it.
[02:46:50.860 --> 02:46:56.141]  I mean, all the old-timers talked about the New World Order building up, but now we see all the things they talked about happening, brother.
[02:46:57.522 --> 02:46:59.562]  Well, I think it's more than just the New World Order.
[02:46:59.602 --> 02:47:06.904]  I think it's really a matter of people have just become too comfortable with the government.
[02:47:06.924 --> 02:47:08.964]  I was reading an article this morning.
[02:47:08.984 --> 02:47:13.865]  52% of the people in the United States have money coming from the government.
[02:47:14.403 --> 02:47:15.903]  Federal government, one way or another.
[02:47:15.923 --> 02:47:19.425]  52% of the American people.
[02:47:19.725 --> 02:47:21.865]  Yeah, I don't have a red shirt coming from them.
[02:47:22.546 --> 02:47:29.048]  So, well, they're also including people on Social Security and things of that nature, but... or dependents.
[02:47:30.208 --> 02:47:34.649]  So, 52% of the American people have got a warm, fuzzy feeling about the government.
[02:47:34.929 --> 02:47:38.951]  And another 10% are in the criminal justice system, so they've got us one way or another.
[02:47:38.971 --> 02:47:40.911]  Aaron Zellman, give us the website.
[02:47:42.092 --> 02:47:43.092]  JPFO.org.
[02:47:44.119 --> 02:47:48.802]  And you'll learn more about our efforts to destroy the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
[02:47:49.343 --> 02:47:52.105]  And that's going to be important with this new push for gun control.
[02:47:52.125 --> 02:47:58.369]  Well, listen, I want to get you up for a full hour in the next few days, so let my producer call you so we can really walk through this so we can take some calls as well.
[02:47:58.709 --> 02:48:00.771]  Aaron Zellman, thank you for spending time with us.
[02:48:01.071 --> 02:48:01.852]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:48:01.912 --> 02:48:02.292]  Be well.
[02:48:02.612 --> 02:48:02.912]  You bet.
[02:48:02.932 --> 02:48:03.313]  Take care.
[02:48:03.353 --> 02:48:05.955]  Well, there's Aaron Zellman thinking it's probably an inside job.
[02:48:06.495 --> 02:48:09.137]  And Larry Pratt said there's some things that are suspicious as well.
[02:48:10.118 --> 02:48:12.079]  And drills and all these things.
[02:48:12.139 --> 02:48:12.779]  I mean, this thing...
[02:48:15.591 --> 02:48:18.313]  I think you're going to find out this guy was under psychiatric care.
[02:48:18.974 --> 02:48:19.854]  You're going to find out.
[02:48:19.995 --> 02:48:22.677]  And God, if he is a Muslim, folks, that's the kickoff.
[02:48:24.298 --> 02:48:28.361]  And there's a slight chance it could just be a nut or a real Muslim terrorist.
[02:48:28.401 --> 02:48:30.342]  There are real things that happen that aren't the government.
[02:48:30.783 --> 02:48:31.843]  There are few and far between.
[02:48:32.684 --> 02:48:39.309]  And I've said real terrorist attacks do look like this, where somebody goes in and stabs 15 people or shoots 45 people.
[02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:43.392]  And I've told you that of the four types of terrorism,
[02:48:44.062 --> 02:48:45.663]  There's really three, but there's one subset.
[02:48:46.144 --> 02:48:48.686]  There's one form that's real organic, and then this could be that.
[02:48:49.246 --> 02:48:51.428]  But it sounds like a guy throwing a fit with his girlfriend.
[02:48:52.489 --> 02:49:01.977]  But in all the other cases, they're on drugs, they're in psychiatric care, their parents are feds, they've been at weird bases, or they were military troops in weird mind control programs.
[02:49:02.278 --> 02:49:05.460]  Remember the guy, Larry Ashbrook?
[02:49:06.942 --> 02:49:08.083]  I'm going from memory on that.
[02:49:08.463 --> 02:49:08.543]  In 1998,
[02:49:11.653 --> 02:49:13.794]  I was at 99 in Fort Worth and it was 98.
[02:49:14.475 --> 02:49:17.036]  Went in and he shot a bunch of people.
[02:49:18.017 --> 02:49:19.478]  And he'd been calling the police department.
[02:49:19.498 --> 02:49:20.138]  He'd been in the Navy.
[02:49:20.158 --> 02:49:21.719]  He'd been in secret operations.
[02:49:21.759 --> 02:49:25.641]  He got out and he would like write to an editor and go, look, I'm under mind control.
[02:49:25.721 --> 02:49:26.682]  I'm not schizophrenic.
[02:49:26.922 --> 02:49:29.504]  And the neighbors saw guys dragging him and put him in a van.
[02:49:29.524 --> 02:49:32.345]  I mean, it wasn't just that he was a lot of schizophrenics out there.
[02:49:32.645 --> 02:49:35.447]  He really was under their control.
[02:49:35.487 --> 02:49:36.748]  He went to Baptist Church.
[02:49:37.632 --> 02:49:39.737]  And then he lined them up and they just groveled.
[02:49:40.358 --> 02:49:42.523]  And he said, you know, do you believe in Jesus?
[02:49:42.583 --> 02:49:42.864]  Yes.
[02:49:42.944 --> 02:49:43.285]  Boom.
[02:49:43.625 --> 02:49:44.968]  Same thing with the Columbine deal.
[02:49:45.810 --> 02:49:47.795]  The mind control involves Satanism.
[02:49:54.093 --> 02:49:59.542]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:49:59.922 --> 02:50:07.534]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:50:08.248 --> 02:50:15.291]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:50:15.691 --> 02:50:27.136]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:50:27.436 --> 02:50:31.358]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:50:31.378 --> 02:50:33.339]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:50:33.659 --> 02:50:37.501]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:51.098 --> 02:51:52.819]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:51:53.039 --> 02:51:56.741]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:51:57.061 --> 02:51:59.282]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[02:52:53.504 --> 02:53:02.227]  Well, the Rosie O'Donnell breaking inside report we put out about what she's planning to do, having first responders on with the dust, and talk about 9-11 later.
[02:53:03.408 --> 02:53:05.549]  What about a huge report today, and it's still going to be big.
[02:53:06.269 --> 02:53:10.971]  Make sure that we don't stop talking about Alberto Gonzalez and the firing gate and all the crimes he's involved in.
[02:53:11.331 --> 02:53:13.932]  Make sure we don't stop talking about how they want to go into Iran.
[02:53:14.212 --> 02:53:22.055]  Make sure we continue to push 9-11 truth, no matter how many mass shootings the feds orchestrate, no matter how many copycats that causes.
[02:53:23.692 --> 02:53:25.513]  We're going to expose this mass shooting thing as well.
[02:53:25.533 --> 02:53:38.679]  We're going to have the Defendant Report, that is the Defendant Preliminary, on mass shootings and the past staged events with all the questions surrounding this out very soon on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net.
[02:53:38.699 --> 02:53:42.921]  So watch that space, watch that channel, and help us get that out.
[02:53:43.041 --> 02:53:45.142]  You, the listeners, are the reason we're having an effect.
[02:53:45.523 --> 02:53:47.263]  You, the listeners, are the reason we're able to reach people.
[02:53:47.804 --> 02:53:49.885]  But Rosie prepares to strike back for 9-11 truth.
[02:53:51.192 --> 02:53:57.619]  Insider scoop, Ground Zero heroes impacted by toxic dust cover up to appear on The View tomorrow, their schedule.
[02:53:57.639 --> 02:53:58.440]  We'll see if that happens.
[02:53:58.820 --> 02:54:03.645]  A headline on the Drudge Report today reads, Rosie no more, impeach Bush talk on The View.
[02:54:04.406 --> 02:54:09.591]  She said on there that she'll just be screaming inside for now on her site, but that's not really what we've got.
[02:54:09.771 --> 02:54:13.335]  We've got the inside, we've talked to her, we've got the email, we've got her inside people as well.
[02:54:15.081 --> 02:54:21.745]  And it goes on to say, we know that these other things include government's criminal cover-up of the Ground Zero toxic dust scandal, killing 9-11 heroes.
[02:54:22.285 --> 02:54:33.772]  Rosie is reportedly sick and tired of the very parties who covered up the toxic dust scandal, then claiming the mantle of 9-11 victims in order to smear anyone who asked questions about the events of that day.
[02:54:33.792 --> 02:54:36.754]  McDonnell is aware of the fact that the majority
[02:54:37.489 --> 02:54:41.293]  of the victim's family members now believe there is an ongoing cover-up surrounding 9-11.
[02:54:41.973 --> 02:54:48.039]  As a result, several Ground Zero first responders are to be interviewed on The View with the first being broadcast on Tuesday morning.
[02:54:49.801 --> 02:54:58.269]  This is the beginning of a carefully planned course of attack to counter the threats and censorship being employed by neocon talking heads to stifle 9-11 truth.
[02:54:58.570 --> 02:55:00.952]  There's also somebody inside the system stifling her
[02:55:02.337 --> 02:55:03.618]  Uh, and it goes on.
[02:55:03.658 --> 02:55:09.060]  This information comes from multiple sources within O'Donnell's inner circle, as well as a prominent member of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:55:09.380 --> 02:55:21.806]  O'Donnell should be applauded once again for having the courage to stand up for the truth in the face of the orchestrated establishment witch hunt, as well as the neocon producer at ABC who is acting as a gatekeeper in trying to prevent the information from being broadcast.
[02:55:22.952 --> 02:55:25.373]  This is all inside stuff you're getting, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:25.873 --> 02:55:37.479]  This is an overwhelming slap in the face the establishment media bullies who thought that their attempts to incriminate and intimidation and chilling free speech could shut Rosie up and prevent 9-11 from, uh, cover up from enjoying maximum exposure.
[02:55:38.733 --> 02:55:52.783]  And it goes on to how she really woke up, when she woke up, what film made her wake up, how delays attacking her, and then we get into the latest 9-11 hoax out of Pravda claiming that Imus was fired because of you going public about 9-11 truth.
[02:55:52.803 --> 02:55:59.527]  The details of that, the insights given, what really happened there is up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:55:59.687 --> 02:56:04.030]  Now I've done 2 hours and 57 minutes 12 seconds and I haven't plugged videos yet.
[02:56:04.671 --> 02:56:07.593]  That's how we fund the operation here, plus they're incredibly good films.
[02:56:08.596 --> 02:56:15.701]  We carry America, freedom to fascism, loose change, second edition, 9-11 mysteries, demolitions, my film Terror Storm, a history of government sponsored terror.

[02:56:30.127 --> 02:56:39.153]  By the way, the TV star of that FX show, Daniel Sanjata, went on the big red carpet at a big premiere wearing one of our 911 Inside Job t-shirts.
[02:56:39.514 --> 02:56:40.914]  That's up on Infowars.net.
[02:56:40.934 --> 02:56:41.415]  That was great.
[02:56:42.195 --> 02:56:52.561]  So get some of those while you're at it, and get the word out, because they're going to use terrorism, they're going to use mass shootings that they create, they provocateur, that they misrepresent with victims they've disarmed.
[02:56:52.621 --> 02:56:53.702]  Either way, the government did this.
[02:56:53.742 --> 02:56:59.345]  The government disarmed the people so they couldn't defend themselves, and it looks like the government's involved in this, even if they've never been involved.
[02:56:59.901 --> 02:57:02.042]  And, uh, it's just amazing.
[02:57:02.082 --> 02:57:05.343]  So, InfoWars.com, get the films, get them out, make copies, never stop.
[02:57:05.583 --> 02:57:10.245]  Don't forget the free podcast of the three-hour show you can subscribe to at InfoWars.com.

[02:57:17.888 --> 02:57:19.709]  The alternative media must grow, and it is.
[02:57:19.989 --> 02:57:21.709]  We must surge and defeat the New World Order.
[02:57:21.969 --> 02:57:24.671]  To my crew, to everybody here at the office, great job.
[02:57:24.991 --> 02:57:27.992]  Now, we'll see you back tomorrow live and back continually here on the network.
[02:57:28.012 --> 02:57:28.392]  God bless.
