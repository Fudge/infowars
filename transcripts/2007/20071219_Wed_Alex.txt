[00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.080]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.541]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:14.201]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.462]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.043 --> 00:00:22.124]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.607 --> 00:00:37.407]  It's hard to believe, but it's true.
[00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.648]  It's already the 19th day of December, 2007.
[00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:48.810]  2007 has come and almost gone in the twinkling and the blinking of an eye.
[00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.230]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:00.752]  Coming up in the last 45 minutes of the show today, my good friend Kevin Booth, who spent three-plus years making a film called American Drug War.
[00:01:01.818 --> 00:01:09.165]  We'll be in studio with me, and who knows, we may have some clips of the film, some audio clips, we'll be playing as well.
[00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:18.273]  It gets into government narcotics trafficking, and then down on the ground police state activities, and just how this is taking control of our entire society.
[00:01:18.313 --> 00:01:23.998]  The film also covers the fact that thousands of times the number of Americans, this is official numbers,
[00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:32.820]  Die from alcohol and prescription drugs than die from heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and every other illegal drug combined.
[00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:43.865]  So we'll be breaking that down today with Kevin in studio, and of course that video interview will then be posted on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:50.588]  And later, about 45 minutes after the live show today, I'm going to be on WLR.
[00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:54.750]  Radio Ireland nationwide is for listeners there.
[00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.074]  It's kind of fun to have listeners tune in when I'm on the radio in South Africa or Ireland or Germany or Russia or Japan.
[00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:08.158]  So perhaps we'll put a link up on Jones Report after the show to that for folks that want to be able to go listen to the audio feed of that.
[00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:09.399]  I'm still a bit under the weather.
[00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.882]  My sore throat has migrated into twin earaches, but actually people like the show yesterday.
[00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:20.085]  It tends to take the edge off me and make me a bit more reflective and calm.
[00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:25.496]  To have a pulsating eustachium tube that feels like an ice pick is jammed in it.
[00:02:27.977 --> 00:02:32.520]  But I am here, ladies and gentlemen, and I am honored to be your host.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.003]  In the news, I'm not going to freak out over this, but people better pay attention to it.
[00:02:38.043 --> 00:02:39.463]  This was not done by accident.
[00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.585]  This was scrolled across the screen three separate times.
[00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:46.867]  Paul is dead.
[00:02:46.887 --> 00:02:47.147]  Paul is dead.
[00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:48.408]  Paul is dead.
[00:02:53.667 --> 00:03:00.673]  They scrolled across the screen three times, Paul is dead, Paul is dead, Paul is dead.
[00:03:02.714 --> 00:03:07.418]  While Congressman Ron Paul was on the Glenn Beck program yesterday.
[00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:18.026]  Glenn Beck, of course, attacked him, savaged him, tried to do guilt by association, tried to basically demonize the Congressman.
[00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:23.703]  Glenn Beck posed as a conservative-slash-libertarian for years, four or five years.
[00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:29.970]  Now he's got his $45 million contract and his book deal, and he's showing his true colors.
[00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:31.031]  It doesn't really matter.
[00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:32.553]  He's a sad, weak person.
[00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:33.834]  You can look in his eyes.
[00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:36.457]  There's no soul-burning there.
[00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:40.502]  Just a little grasping, manipulative, deceptive worm.
[00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:46.858]  Glenn Beck's show scrolls Paul is dead message during interview.
[00:03:46.918 --> 00:04:00.305]  Now remember Ron Paul a few months ago here said that he believes he is in real danger, could be assassinated, others have been assassinated if he continued to gain growth at the exponential level and his trajectory continued.
[00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:05.607]  Actually, the trajectory has actually intensified towards victory.
[00:04:06.728 --> 00:04:11.410]  And then Daniel Istilin, who has always been accurate in the past and never brings rumors on this show,
[00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:15.577]  It was always very serious and very conservative in his presentation.
[00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:20.521]  Very conservative in the information he brings forward, compared to what he tells me privately.
[00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:29.827]  And even that is guarded, saying that the highest levels of intelligence are in the inner circles of the elite, open discussions of, do they need to kill Ron Paul?
[00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:33.089]  And so we did a report on that over the weekend.
[00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.435]  But now they're scolding, Ron Paul is dead, Ron Paul is dead, Ron Paul is dead, across the screen.
[00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:44.438]  When he's on television.
[00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.839]  We'll be right back to cover this and a lot more.
[00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.620]  These reports are up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.080]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:03.342]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:04.402 --> 00:05:05.442]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.162 --> 00:05:07.122]  In the near future.
[00:05:07.983 --> 00:05:09.663]  Earth is dominated by a power.
[00:05:11.064 --> 00:05:12.806]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:16.129]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.132]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:27.180]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:35.180]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:39.143]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.503 --> 00:05:42.025]  Build America is making great progress for the world government.
[00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:43.226]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.246 --> 00:05:43.986]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:45.087]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.307 --> 00:05:46.048]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:47.409]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:55.634]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:07:10.537 --> 00:07:11.858]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:12.038 --> 00:07:15.419]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:08.812]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.412 --> 00:08:12.473]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:20.436]  Elites throughout history have assassinated their political enemies.
[00:08:21.713 --> 00:08:25.016]  Emperors have been killed, upstart Roman senators.
[00:08:26.258 --> 00:08:30.342]  There were countless assassinations on both sides in the Revolutionary War.
[00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:36.408]  But then the last 50, 60 years, our media told us there's no such thing as government assassinations.
[00:08:37.369 --> 00:08:45.437]  It's always a lone patsy that does it, or someone always accidentally gets poisoned, or they accidentally drown in a canoe in one inch of water.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:55.127]  Or they always accidentally shoot themselves two or three or four times in the head, or they accidentally torture themselves to death and cut their own head off and arms and legs off.
[00:08:56.408 --> 00:09:01.672]  Again, they treat us like complete and total children, and they just set the precedent to just lie.
[00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:15.944]  But Ron Paul, a few months ago on this show, this radio transmission, you can go to PrisonPlanet.com and link through to that original story, said that he knows that
[00:09:17.128 --> 00:09:30.937]  It is dangerous that he is aware of the fact that the establishment could try to assassinate him if he continues to gain ground.
[00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:42.684]  It's clear that they're using other tactics right now, like using Huckabee as a distraction, creating false buzz, creating false hype,
[00:09:43.436 --> 00:09:53.745]  Commissioning polls that lean towards Huckabee, while not including Ron Paul in most of the polls or most of the discussions on television, radio and in newsprint.
[00:09:54.786 --> 00:10:05.895]  Though the second mega-massive money bomb of the 16th of Sunday has forced a massive media event, and polls numbers are going up yet again.
[00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:13.811]  We're going to see what happens very, very soon in Iowa and New Hampshire coming up in just the next two weeks.
[00:10:15.512 --> 00:10:20.736]  We'll be tracking that, we'll be covering that here in great detail.
[00:10:22.778 --> 00:10:27.081]  But let's actually read what Ron Paul said in response to me.
[00:10:27.101 --> 00:10:37.670]  In fact, we ought to just dig that actual audio interview up and play what the Congressman said a few months ago about this subject.
[00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:56.024]  Because some of the more orthodox Paulians, kind of the mainline Republicans, they are saying that, well, you know, there's no such thing as political assassinations, and we shouldn't discuss this.
[00:10:57.205 --> 00:10:58.727]  We shouldn't talk about this.
[00:10:59.867 --> 00:11:12.431]  But Ron Paul himself has stated on previous occasions that he is aware of the dangers of being such a bold icon for freedom and understands that political assassinations have occurred in the past.
[00:11:13.752 --> 00:11:15.872]  And of course the media will say that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:11:15.892 --> 00:11:17.613]  There's never been a political assassination.
[00:11:17.973 --> 00:11:19.453]  There is no North American Union.
[00:11:19.814 --> 00:11:21.094]  There is no government corruption.
[00:11:21.394 --> 00:11:23.995]  When the government's lips move, only truth pours forth.
[00:11:24.597 --> 00:11:25.478]  Hand over your guns.
[00:11:25.538 --> 00:11:26.239]  Everything's fine.
[00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:28.020]  The dollar is keeping its value.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.101]  The economy is wonderful.
[00:11:29.482 --> 00:11:30.503]  Open borders are good.
[00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:47.058]  In a June appearance on the Alex Jones Show, Congressman Ron Paul acknowledged that such a threat is real, agreeing with a number of historical examples where leaders were killed or attacked for successfully standing up to the system.
[00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:48.186]  That's right!
[00:11:48.306 --> 00:11:51.028]  They'll do it, Paul said, making reference with Alex Jones.
[00:11:51.548 --> 00:11:58.432]  The upstarts like Andrew Jackson, the Kingfish Huey Long, Bobby Kennedy, George Washington, and even George Wallace.
[00:11:59.691 --> 00:12:09.799]  Estlin pointed out that his past predictions about global events were very accurate because of the solid information provided to him from within Bilderberg and the elite.
[00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:22.249]  Over 18 months ago, Estlin correctly made the call that the Iran war had been delayed and was probably off the table, which is looking to be exactly the case after the release of recent national intelligence estimates.
[00:12:22.702 --> 00:12:29.606]  Festelman is featured at length in my new film, Endgame, in which he also is filmed making the prediction based on his sources.
[00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:50.296]  He's made countless other comments along those lines and other predictions that have come through from inside the councils of power, from inside elite circles, people inside elite circles, their servants, their minions, who do not like what they're seeing happening.
[00:12:53.726 --> 00:13:06.979]  I have some similar sources, but we have to be very careful because sometimes the establishment will plant things on them when they're under suspicion so that they can then test and see who's leaking.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:17.810]  But again, if I went through all the things that Estlin has been right about, all the things he's predicted from his 15 plus years of covering Bilderberg, it would make your head spin.
[00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:37.973]  But on top of all of that now, we have Glenn Beck, definite establishment hack, saying that we should use the military against domestic threats, and that Ron Paul's supporters are domestic threats, like Timothy McVeigh's supporters, and that's what he said a few months ago.
[00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:41.474]  He said on the radio that I'm, quote, very, very dangerous.
[00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:46.336]  He gets Ron Paul on yesterday.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.623]  And he brings up the point again about, are your supporters terrorists?
[00:13:51.723 --> 00:13:56.286]  Just out of the blue, no evidence of that, no indicators of that, they're just setting the table.
[00:13:56.987 --> 00:13:58.428]  Are your supporters terrorists?
[00:13:58.488 --> 00:14:08.696]  See how they build the big apparatus of anti-terror and fighting the magic men, the super men that can control all these huge events from caves, hooked up to dialysis.
[00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.219]  You know, around their campfires.
[00:14:17.002 --> 00:14:17.803]  Well, now,
[00:14:19.835 --> 00:14:30.700]  They're just shifting that over to, oh, you the American people that don't like NAFTA and GATT and the Napa Superhighways and the North American Union and the Security Prosperity Partnership.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.200]  You are the terrorists.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.981]  You're in bed with Islamofascists.
[00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:34.922]  That's an exact quote.
[00:14:35.662 --> 00:14:36.943]  They bring that up to Ron Paul.
[00:14:38.943 --> 00:14:45.486]  And then as they bring that up, scrolling across the screen three times, Paul is dead.
[00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:47.007]  Paul is dead.
[00:14:48.652 --> 00:14:49.973]  Paul is dead.
[00:14:51.854 --> 00:14:53.775]  You can't accidentally do that.
[00:14:53.895 --> 00:15:11.566]  In fact, they did it three times so that the message would be clear to anyone with half a brain that you could say, oh, we accidentally said Paul is dead, or we meant to say Paul is in the lead, or Paul is Fred, Paul is something else.
[00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:12.507]  No, it's clear.
[00:15:12.807 --> 00:15:13.647]  Paul is dead.
[00:15:14.088 --> 00:15:14.948]  Paul is dead.
[00:15:15.288 --> 00:15:16.029]  Paul is dead.
[00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:18.294]  You don't have typos like that.
[00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:19.155]  Paul is dead.
[00:15:19.596 --> 00:15:20.396]  Paul is dead.
[00:15:20.777 --> 00:15:21.477]  Paul is dead.
[00:15:21.517 --> 00:15:23.239]  Just nothing connected to it.
[00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:24.560]  No reason why it's up there.
[00:15:25.681 --> 00:15:26.361]  In your face.
[00:15:27.422 --> 00:15:30.105]  They have him on for an hour and they scroll across the screen.
[00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:30.685]  You're dead.
[00:15:31.506 --> 00:15:32.086]  You're dead.
[00:15:32.186 --> 00:15:32.587]  You're dead.
[00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:35.970]  And to make sure everybody knew who they were talking about.
[00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.691]  Paul is dead.
[00:15:40.093 --> 00:15:41.154]  Paul is dead.
[00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.316]  Paul is dead.
[00:15:45.715 --> 00:16:03.827]  We need to get an article out on PrisonPlanet.com or TruthNews pointing out that Ron Paul has said there's a danger of assassination, pointing out that Daniel Estelin has pointed out that this is coming from higher levels of inner core within the inner core, that it's being considered and weighed, and that now this is pretty much confirmation.
[00:16:04.247 --> 00:16:09.870]  You have an establishment, what appears to be an intelligence hack, most of them aren't intelligence hacks.
[00:16:10.351 --> 00:16:12.012]  Most of them aren't actually government operatives.
[00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:13.833]  Beck appears to be one.
[00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:21.972]  In his demeanor, in his work ethic, in his habits, in his stance.
[00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.253]  A very, very dangerous individual.
[00:16:26.794 --> 00:16:30.535]  And this only confirms, this is very serious.
[00:16:31.676 --> 00:16:32.396]  Very serious.
[00:16:32.816 --> 00:16:34.376]  This is a mafia message.
[00:16:35.577 --> 00:16:38.878]  Like sending somebody a newspaper with three mackerel in it.
[00:16:39.838 --> 00:16:41.819]  You're going to be sleeping with the fishes, buddy boy.
[00:16:43.183 --> 00:16:46.685]  Or sending you a doll with its head cut off, that's another thing they do.
[00:16:49.126 --> 00:16:54.089]  Or sending you a letter that just says, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead.
[00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.032]  And so they become so arrogant, so out in the open with their mafioso tactics.
[00:17:00.673 --> 00:17:06.156]  I mean, Giuliani, all these guys, it's just mafioso strutting.
[00:17:06.176 --> 00:17:10.218]  You've got this mafioso class that work for the larger big central banks.
[00:17:11.443 --> 00:17:18.146]  And they just kind of mopping it down around, carrying out the black ops, killing us, doing whatever they want, sucking off of us.
[00:17:21.967 --> 00:17:34.652]  But I'll never forget, I was in Los Angeles in 2002 to tape some episodes of The Conspiracy Zone with Kevin Nealon, the guy from Saturday Night Live.
[00:17:36.073 --> 00:17:40.875]  And you had your own dressing room where they put makeup and stuff on you, but I went down, I was about to go on stage, I had to go to the bathroom.
[00:17:42.034 --> 00:17:45.255]  So I go in there and I'm standing there at the urinal.
[00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:53.937]  And over walks the head of the President's Media Council, Lionel Chetwin.
[00:17:55.157 --> 00:18:02.219]  He's the guy that produced the TV shows, two different ones, but one big Maverick TV movie where Bush is a hero on 9-11 and they dramatize it all.
[00:18:02.239 --> 00:18:09.520]  And he walks right over and I'm zipping my pants up as he gets in my face like a Mafia Don.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.541]  I mean, he looked like somebody out of one of those movies.
[00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:15.384]  And started going, you're Alex Jones, aren't you?
[00:18:15.504 --> 00:18:15.864]  Aren't you?
[00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:20.989]  And in my face, poking his finger in my shoulder.
[00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.033]  And I turn around and I look at him and I go, yeah, you're Lionel Chetwin.
[00:18:26.134 --> 00:18:29.257]  And he goes, we're going to get you!
[00:18:29.277 --> 00:18:31.659]  And I did something he didn't expect.
[00:18:31.699 --> 00:18:32.480]  I started laughing at him.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.821]  I said, good, good.
[00:18:34.362 --> 00:18:36.344]  And I didn't even stop to wash my hands.
[00:18:37.296 --> 00:18:40.977]  Because I wanted to set him up while he was in his emotional state, jazzed up.
[00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:43.839]  That's when I perform, is when I'm under pressure.
[00:18:43.879 --> 00:18:45.459]  I generally go the opposite direction.
[00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:51.001]  I either go berserk, if it's physical, or if it's somebody trying to manipulate me, I suddenly get the brain boost.
[00:18:51.821 --> 00:18:55.643]  And I said, come on, let's go out here and talk about it.
[00:18:55.963 --> 00:19:02.125]  Because I knew that the assistant producers were waiting for me outside of the door.
[00:19:02.846 --> 00:19:06.407]  And so as he's got his, he's kind of turned to me, walking out the door.
[00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.491]  And he's going, yeah, I'm going to get you.
[00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:10.172]  And I said, oh, they just heard that.
[00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:10.972]  You're going to get me.
[00:19:11.993 --> 00:19:13.914]  I said, oh, and he goes, I'm just joking.
[00:19:14.975 --> 00:19:19.538]  Then I went on air and I talked about him threatening me and his lawyer called up, sent me a letter, called up.
[00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:22.540]  And I called the lawyer up and I said, hey, brother, I got three witnesses.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.501]  I said, don't you ever threaten me again.
[00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:26.262]  Do you understand?
[00:19:26.282 --> 00:19:28.843]  And he said, yeah, I understand.
[00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:29.684]  And I said, that's right.
[00:19:30.384 --> 00:19:34.827]  Your client threatened me in a bathroom and he did it in front of witnesses.
[00:19:35.247 --> 00:19:36.108]  So shut your mouth.
[00:19:37.136 --> 00:19:38.417]  I don't appreciate your threats.
[00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:41.960]  They're mafia, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:42.541]  They're mafia.
[00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:47.945]  And that punk Chetland thinks that he's gonna threaten me in the bathroom.
[00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:48.766]  He's got nothing coming.
[00:19:49.106 --> 00:19:52.149]  Hey, brother, I'm not afraid to die.
[00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.610]  I'm already committed.
[00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.532]  I already jumped out of the airplane, okay?
[00:19:55.992 --> 00:19:57.514]  I don't know if I got a parachute or not.
[00:19:57.954 --> 00:19:59.916]  There's nothing you can do to me, slimebag.
[00:20:01.778 --> 00:20:03.039]  Ted Anders for Midas December 19, 2007.
[00:20:03.099 --> 00:20:05.220]  Gold 830 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $824.47, $406.35 for half, $203.18 for quarter.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:05.840]  That's $824.47, $406.35 and $203.18.
[00:20:15.686 --> 00:20:18.969]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[00:20:19.289 --> 00:20:23.473]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[00:20:23.853 --> 00:20:27.837]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[00:20:28.217 --> 00:20:30.039]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:32.241]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:38.505]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[00:20:38.765 --> 00:20:45.549]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[00:20:45.889 --> 00:20:49.231]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:52.753]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.233 --> 00:20:56.335]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[00:20:56.475 --> 00:20:56.735]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:56.835 --> 00:20:58.256]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[00:21:02.955 --> 00:21:05.016]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:05.637 --> 00:21:14.542]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:15.022 --> 00:21:22.206]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:21:22.924 --> 00:21:28.406]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:21:28.907 --> 00:21:39.731]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:21:40.492 --> 00:21:42.552]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:44.473]  For more information, call 702-954-7000.
[00:21:53.166 --> 00:22:03.229]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:09.090]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:22:09.571 --> 00:22:17.493]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:22:18.013 --> 00:22:18.233]  Thank you.
[00:22:33.468 --> 00:22:37.351]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:38.152]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:22:38.172 --> 00:22:38.372]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[00:22:38.392 --> 00:22:41.154]  Or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[00:22:41.554 --> 00:22:45.257]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:22:45.577 --> 00:22:46.778]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:06.245]  As the old saying goes, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
[00:23:06.425 --> 00:23:11.930]  But if you give him a Berkey system, you give him the ability to obtain purified water for a lifetime.
[00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:17.335]  This year, when giving Christmas gifts, instead of unwanted trinkets, give a meaningful and substantial gift.
[00:23:17.655 --> 00:23:22.638]  Berkey systems are ideal for every member of your family, especially the young ones in college.
[00:23:22.878 --> 00:23:30.802]  Unlike other water filtration systems, Berkey purifiers are portable, they require no plumbing, and the elements don't have to be replaced every four to six months.
[00:23:31.222 --> 00:23:37.646]  Perfect for anyone on a tight budget, and more importantly, if there's an unexpected emergency, your loved ones will be prepared.
[00:23:37.966 --> 00:23:41.748]  That's because Berkey systems are able to purify raw, untreated water.
[00:23:42.168 --> 00:23:44.949]  Check out our Christmas specials at Berkeywater.com.
[00:23:45.089 --> 00:23:50.770]  With one of our quantity specials, you not only get a discount, but in one stop you can get gifts for the entire family.
[00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.390]  That's Berkeywater.com or call 888-03-4438.
[00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:52.610]  That's 888-03-4438.
[00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:53.970]  Anyone who doesn't think that this planet
[00:24:12.438 --> 00:24:15.200]  has always been ruled by violence is ignorant.
[00:24:18.482 --> 00:24:36.013]  And what happens in the few free societies we've had is groups of commoners and middle class have gotten together and said, we want to be left alone by the power brokers, by the king rats.
[00:24:36.953 --> 00:24:39.615]  We want to be able to build our own
[00:24:40.561 --> 00:25:08.066]  Businesses and societies, and the few times that we've seen that occur, less than three or four times, in modern history, business, invention, health, just virtue, everything, explodes, builds, grows very quickly.
[00:25:09.511 --> 00:25:14.052]  And then every time you have tyranny, things unravel and stagnate and just get worse and worse.
[00:25:16.252 --> 00:25:38.336]  But somehow they convinced the public that America is Disneyland, Disney World, there's no one corrupt in government, there's no one corrupt in business, nobody wants to cheat you, nobody wants to screw you, everything's fine, just don't question, go through life trusting whatever you're told by the nice men in black uniforms with the submachine guns, and cameras face scanning you are good, and checkpoints are good, and
[00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:54.681]  You know, having all of your rights taken away is good, but then having whole classes of criminals left alone by the government is wonderful, and selective enforcement is good, and endless preemptive wars are good.
[00:25:56.602 --> 00:26:00.102]  There have always been powerful people that want to eat your lunch.
[00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:06.363]  There have always been powerful individuals that want to dominate societies.
[00:26:08.484 --> 00:26:09.544]  That's the way it's always been.
[00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:22.928]  That's the way it's going to be until people at birth are taught this, are taught about liberty, are taught about human systems, are taught basic sociology on how humans in groups interact.
[00:26:23.609 --> 00:26:24.949]  That's all the elite studies.
[00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:32.753]  As long as they understand what makes us tick and how we operate and how to manipulate us and how to push our buttons and pull our strings, they're going to rule.
[00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:40.096]  But the minute the society is aware of these tricks, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:26:44.105 --> 00:26:57.909]  And so that's why they spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year in propaganda and manipulation, and in studying trends and what people think, and where we're going, so that they can cook up the most sophisticated, multi-layered propaganda.
[00:26:58.369 --> 00:27:01.831]  Tailored, niche propaganda for different subgroups.
[00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:09.533]  And at the end of the day, they have a lot of scientists and a lot of great minds running
[00:27:10.914 --> 00:27:24.519]  The basic development of the battle plan, but then the elite higher-ups from the elite families that own the system have become somewhat decadent and inbred, still cunning and very intelligent, and they're not implementing or following the scientific directives properly.
[00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:25.780]  Thank God!
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:32.842]  The genius-level stuff I've read that's public by the mind controllers is just almost invincible.
[00:27:34.243 --> 00:27:40.565]  But the elites then don't implement it exactly as they are recommended, because they're in control.
[00:27:41.517 --> 00:27:43.398]  And their technocrats are not.
[00:27:45.159 --> 00:28:07.931]  Though the system's getting so complex that instead of bloody coups by the Praetorian Guard against the Caesar, or instead of the brother of the king killing him, making himself king, instead of elite bloody overthrows at the top, the technocracy soon will be able to overthrow the elite system, the current elite system, and the elite system may not even know they've been overthrown.
[00:28:08.562 --> 00:28:23.832]  That's how advanced all of this different technological developments have gotten, and now these different fields of technological mechanisms are now merging together at an accelerated rate.
[00:28:24.793 --> 00:28:33.619]  And with as much suppressed technology as we know they've suppressed in the past, God only knows what level the elite are actually at the technological development.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.261]  And then you compare that to a public
[00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:49.364]  That really thinks the nightly news is all there is to the world and really thinks life is about cooking steaks in the backyard and watching the Minnesota Vikings.
[00:28:52.467 --> 00:29:01.833]  And they aren't even attempting to try to grasp this when people who are really alike with the fires of genius
[00:29:02.552 --> 00:29:17.041]  Have trouble even comprehending and studying all of its facets, because it's a disciplined and a technologically developed system that has taken hundreds of years to accrue and has become really institutionalized.
[00:29:17.901 --> 00:29:20.943]  People say, well, how come the global government just keeps growing generationally?
[00:29:21.504 --> 00:29:22.764]  You know, how do they pass it on?
[00:29:22.784 --> 00:29:24.625]  Well, it's like a university or a company.
[00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:27.067]  It just goes on and has new directors.
[00:29:28.268 --> 00:29:31.890]  And then it becomes a system where the system's push is to grow.
[00:29:34.218 --> 00:29:36.219]  Alright, more on Glenn Beck's show.
[00:29:36.239 --> 00:29:38.501]  Scrolls Paul as dead message during interview.
[00:29:39.161 --> 00:29:44.044]  Latest pathetic mud-swinging attempt smears Paul as Zionist shill.
[00:29:45.365 --> 00:29:46.305]  And a lot more.
[00:29:46.325 --> 00:29:48.747]  Ron Paul says he might run in a third party.
[00:29:51.969 --> 00:29:52.949]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.971]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.891 --> 00:29:58.593]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.837 --> 00:30:03.677]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:30:03.818 --> 00:30:08.999]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:30:09.159 --> 00:30:10.519]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:30:10.779 --> 00:30:18.941]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:24.903]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:30:25.063 --> 00:30:26.845]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:29.068]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:30:29.228 --> 00:30:33.473]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:30:33.633 --> 00:30:35.776]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[00:30:35.856 --> 00:30:43.265]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:45.231]  I think so.
[00:31:01.272 --> 00:31:01.932]  It's a fact.
[00:31:02.132 --> 00:31:09.614]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:18.595]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:31:18.875 --> 00:31:29.417]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:31:29.677 --> 00:31:35.740]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.983]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:31:41.163 --> 00:31:45.646]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:31:45.806 --> 00:31:47.607]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:31:47.667 --> 00:31:47.927]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:31:47.947 --> 00:31:48.527]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:31:48.567 --> 00:31:50.288]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:31:57.533 --> 00:31:59.219]  Visit FDRS.org today!
[00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:04.702]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:07.043]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:32:07.183 --> 00:32:09.644]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:32:09.905 --> 00:32:14.266]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:32:14.306 --> 00:32:14.987]  Here's why.
[00:32:15.387 --> 00:32:21.329]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:27.572]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:32:27.792 --> 00:32:28.712]  But they're not cheating.
[00:32:28.952 --> 00:32:32.955]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:32:33.135 --> 00:32:37.479]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:32:37.579 --> 00:32:45.085]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:45.745]  Get control.
[00:32:45.966 --> 00:32:46.526]  Get relief.
[00:32:46.586 --> 00:32:47.287]  Get some sleep.
[00:32:47.407 --> 00:32:50.589]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[00:32:50.729 --> 00:32:54.112]  That's www.OutIn90.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:54.132 --> 00:32:54.372]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:58.095 --> 00:33:12.647]  All right, let me run through some of the news that's coming up and I'm going to go to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:13.167]  The Glenn Beck Show.
[00:33:13.187 --> 00:33:15.009]  The Scrolls Paul is dead and that's a sharing interview.
[00:33:15.069 --> 00:33:15.569]  More on that
[00:33:24.674 --> 00:33:28.735]  Latest pathetic mud-slinging attempt smears Ron Paul a Zionist shelf.
[00:33:29.275 --> 00:33:36.416]  Ron Paul has written more than 15 books and more than 30 pamphlets and contributed to a bunch of other books.
[00:33:37.036 --> 00:33:45.518]  More than 15 years ago he wrote a book about the gold standard with an author that approached him who later became a PNAC neocon.
[00:33:46.498 --> 00:33:52.639]  And so this is the ultimate proof now on the internet that Ron Paul is in control of the neocons.
[00:33:52.699 --> 00:33:53.179]  Is that why
[00:33:55.109 --> 00:33:56.510]  He has given speeches against them.
[00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.271]  One of the first people to expose them is they're a bunch of communists.
[00:34:00.672 --> 00:34:01.693]  They're communist roots.
[00:34:01.753 --> 00:34:05.114]  Is that why he has been threatened by them?
[00:34:05.715 --> 00:34:09.477]  It's just, you have to judge a tree by its fruits, number one.
[00:34:11.658 --> 00:34:12.939]  It's about what people do.
[00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:14.620]  All the legislation he's blocked.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.341]  All the good legislation he's gotten passed.
[00:34:18.662 --> 00:34:20.703]  All of the things that Ron Paul has done.
[00:34:20.763 --> 00:34:22.664]  I mean, do you think the elite wants the public?
[00:34:24.005 --> 00:34:25.426]  Waking up to the war is bad?
[00:34:26.027 --> 00:34:27.608]  Waking up to the North American Union?
[00:34:29.309 --> 00:34:31.611]  Why do you think the elite are blocking him out of the polls?
[00:34:32.251 --> 00:34:34.052]  Why do you think they're cheating him at straw polls?
[00:34:34.753 --> 00:34:40.837]  You see, judge their actions against him, their fruits, and then look at the... you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:34:41.878 --> 00:34:42.378]  It's simple.
[00:34:42.418 --> 00:34:43.719]  Should we keep this apple tree?
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.821]  Yeah, it's still producing a lot of good fruit.
[00:34:47.782 --> 00:34:49.003]  It's still making a lot of apples.
[00:34:49.163 --> 00:34:51.745]  Or, no, it's making two or three scrawny apples a year.
[00:34:51.785 --> 00:34:53.026]  Let's cut it down and plant another one.
[00:34:53.464 --> 00:34:58.608]  For those who don't know, fruit trees, apple trees, pear trees, plum trees only last 10-15 years.
[00:35:00.149 --> 00:35:02.891]  So that's why you get, I mean, most fruit trees don't last very long.
[00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:06.213]  Don't produce a lot of fruit for very long.
[00:35:06.233 --> 00:35:09.115]  Of course, grapevines are different.
[00:35:09.155 --> 00:35:10.276]  The older the better, generally.
[00:35:11.237 --> 00:35:12.458]  They can be hundreds of years old.
[00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:17.241]  But some say they're thousands, but that hasn't been scientifically proven yet.
[00:35:18.041 --> 00:35:23.762]  But there have been people running vineyards passing down the information that some of these vines are thousands of years old back in the Roman Empire.
[00:35:24.602 --> 00:35:31.744]  But regardless of all of that, the point is you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:35:31.944 --> 00:35:37.265]  And Ron Paul has produced nothing but succulent, delicious fruit to liberty.
[00:35:38.665 --> 00:35:39.626]  And that's how you judge it.
[00:35:39.646 --> 00:35:42.106]  So I'll get a little bit into that report later.
[00:35:43.827 --> 00:35:45.787]  Also, this is really the big news today.
[00:35:48.357 --> 00:35:54.623]  I'm going to try to get Watson to do an expanded report on this and on the fact that there's more mounting evidence that they are considering killing him.
[00:35:55.643 --> 00:35:58.526]  Ron Paul doesn't rule out third-party run.
[00:35:59.467 --> 00:36:03.831]  There are a lot of things happening these days, but it isn't raw potential for chaos.
[00:36:07.454 --> 00:36:11.037]  This item in Newsweek might turn out to be the biggest story of the day.
[00:36:11.077 --> 00:36:12.218]  This is from AOL News.
[00:36:12.998 --> 00:36:14.739]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:18.240]  If you don't win, this is them asking Ron Paul questions.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:24.843]  If you don't win, will you support the GOP nominee and promise not to run on a Libertarian or any other ticket?
[00:36:26.383 --> 00:36:28.004]  I'm not promising any of those things.
[00:36:28.084 --> 00:36:34.626]  If we have a Republican nominee that has convinced me they have come around on foreign policy, I would consider it.
[00:36:35.787 --> 00:36:41.749]  As far as running on a third-party ticket or as an Independent or Libertarian, I have no plans to do that.
[00:36:42.611 --> 00:36:48.916]  Remember Hillary said over and over again she was never going to run for president and she had no plans to do it and then she did it.
[00:36:49.956 --> 00:36:51.978]  Well, no plans doesn't mean you won't.
[00:36:52.638 --> 00:37:00.864]  The best way I can state it is I have no plans, I can't conceive of it, but I guess in life there aren't that many absolutes.
[00:37:03.286 --> 00:37:08.330]  He's just raised another $5 million on top of what is probably over $10 million this quarter.
[00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:10.952]  Yeah, it's at like $19 million right now.
[00:37:11.676 --> 00:37:19.755]  Yet he is not budging much in the big polls, and Huckabee, right now, is stealing all the media attention.
[00:37:20.436 --> 00:37:26.041]  If he can't bulge the numbers, budge the numbers, in Iowa and New Hampshire, exactly what is he going to do with all that money?
[00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:29.684]  As far as I understand, it can only be used for political campaigns.
[00:37:30.184 --> 00:37:35.969]  There's going to be huge temptation to go third party, and that could alter the balance of the race, the national race.
[00:37:35.989 --> 00:37:42.014]  Consider, in a Hillary vs. Rudy race, Ron Paul's independent would have the only get-out-of-Iraq credibility.
[00:37:42.054 --> 00:37:47.638]  Traditionally, you would think he would hurt the GOP, but then the anti-war angle is a significant wild card.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.200]  Yeah.
[00:37:49.861 --> 00:37:56.183]  People have been saying, hey, he's saying if he doesn't win or come up in second place in some of the primaries, he's gonna drop out.
[00:37:56.263 --> 00:37:59.043]  Ron Paul has said, I have no plans to run as a third party.
[00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:00.604]  He has to say that.
[00:38:01.164 --> 00:38:10.586]  If he did say that, if he said, yeah, I'll run as a Libertarian, or I'll run as a Constitutional Party, or I'll run as the Ron Paul Revolution Party, as a populist, they'd say, see?
[00:38:10.986 --> 00:38:12.006]  He's not a Republican.
[00:38:12.046 --> 00:38:12.727]  Don't go for him.
[00:38:12.767 --> 00:38:13.727]  He's planning to drop out.
[00:38:13.767 --> 00:38:14.587]  He's not serious.
[00:38:15.342 --> 00:38:17.343]  They're already trying to say he's planning that.
[00:38:17.763 --> 00:38:19.063]  So he is playing politics.
[00:38:19.103 --> 00:38:20.064]  I mean, he is a man.
[00:38:20.524 --> 00:38:21.724]  He is playing politics.
[00:38:21.984 --> 00:38:22.945]  He's trying to win.
[00:38:24.465 --> 00:38:25.726]  He hasn't compromised much.
[00:38:25.766 --> 00:38:27.126]  He's compromised on 9-11.
[00:38:28.106 --> 00:38:32.428]  And he's compromised a little on The View and a few other places where he won't say, I'm against abortion.
[00:38:32.728 --> 00:38:34.729]  I mean, on this show or other shows, he'll say, it's a life.
[00:38:35.389 --> 00:38:37.930]  Mutual, you know, aggression pact.
[00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.971]  You're not allowed to initiate force.
[00:38:41.931 --> 00:38:42.831]  That's a human being.
[00:38:42.892 --> 00:38:44.192]  It's protected by the Constitution.
[00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:46.831]  I'm a obstetrician.
[00:38:46.851 --> 00:38:49.774]  I delivered 4,000-something babies, and it's wrong.
[00:38:50.334 --> 00:38:52.576]  He'll say that here on Conservative or Libertarian shows.
[00:38:53.216 --> 00:38:56.799]  But when he gets on other places, he will, you know, just kind of go, well, I'll leave that up to the states.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.123]  You know, he's trying to depoliticize that political football.
[00:39:04.446 --> 00:39:06.706]  And I can say on the surface, that sounds like it's right.
[00:39:06.726 --> 00:39:08.207]  You know, that's the thing to do.
[00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:10.487]  The problem is, is a slippery slope.
[00:39:10.627 --> 00:39:20.549]  Once you start playing politics, once you start controlling what you say, once you start holding back what you really think, it, you know, it just has to be watched.
[00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:21.609]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:39:21.649 --> 00:39:22.770]  We have to all watch ourselves.
[00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.771]  I hold back stuff, but I don't hold back information.
[00:39:27.831 --> 00:39:29.911]  I don't hold back what I really think about situations.
[00:39:30.689 --> 00:39:37.393]  But I do hold back with people I want to attack, people who lied about me, people that lead people astray.
[00:39:37.473 --> 00:39:41.856]  I do want to attack them, but it just becomes a distraction and a diversion, so I don't do it.
[00:39:42.176 --> 00:39:47.320]  So I think all of us self-govern and control what we say and do, and don't let it all completely hang out.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.223]  I mean, if I did, I'd be yelling, screaming, cussing right now, you know, calling for people's heads.
[00:39:54.845 --> 00:39:55.905]  Alright, so that's coming up.
[00:39:55.985 --> 00:39:59.948]  Also, NASCO says, Paul is confused about Napa Superhighway.
[00:40:00.802 --> 00:40:02.223]  They're really in spin overdrive.
[00:40:02.643 --> 00:40:04.004]  Another story by Paul Watson.
[00:40:04.424 --> 00:40:07.186]  Rockefellers joked about controlling the world.
[00:40:07.206 --> 00:40:10.908]  Elitist sons would carve up the planet into different fiefdoms.
[00:40:11.668 --> 00:40:13.969]  Something really behind the joke, admits biographer.
[00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:17.731]  This is the Rockefeller family biographer, saying they plan to rule the world.
[00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:19.772]  Well, I mean, have you read David Rockefeller's biography?
[00:40:21.593 --> 00:40:27.136]  Ministry of Homeland Security is now going into local malls with scanning cameras.
[00:40:27.156 --> 00:40:27.917]  We're going to get into that.
[00:40:29.457 --> 00:40:32.280]  Police brutality cases are on the rise since 9-11.
[00:40:34.202 --> 00:40:36.925]  Police accused of firing taser into head of innocent man.
[00:40:38.867 --> 00:40:39.348]  Repeatedly.
[00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:43.973]  Retired FBI agent waterboarding produced crap information from attainees.
[00:40:44.754 --> 00:40:45.875]  That's what they want to feed us.
[00:40:47.197 --> 00:40:50.981]  MPAA rejects Gibney's dark poster, more media censorship.
[00:40:53.337 --> 00:40:56.498]  That's just some of what is coming up today.
[00:40:57.358 --> 00:41:01.539]  Right now, let's just go ahead and go to Ethan in Florida.
[00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:02.419]  You're on the air.
[00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:02.840]  Go ahead.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.040]  Hey, Alex.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:04.740]  Hi.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.380]  Hey, I got two things.
[00:41:07.281 --> 00:41:13.782]  Well, the Glenn Beck thing last night, that just seemed like a big, I don't know, hit piece to me or something.
[00:41:13.842 --> 00:41:19.484]  I don't know if everyone else saw what I saw, but every time it goes from a commercial
[00:41:19.983 --> 00:41:22.805]  Well, that's a way that they can edit live on air is that CNN will do that.
[00:41:22.825 --> 00:41:27.427]  They will claim you're live
[00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:39.670]  Oh, I didn't even see that.
[00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.130]  Yeah, I didn't see that.
[00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.091]  I didn't catch the whole thing, though.
[00:41:43.231 --> 00:41:43.451]  But, uh...
[00:42:11.152 --> 00:42:14.634]  Yeah, I appreciate your call.
[00:42:14.814 --> 00:42:17.915]  You know, again, this has become a great diversion.
[00:42:20.016 --> 00:42:25.739]  Everybody keeps talking, including all the Patriot Talk Show hosts, about the Superhighway in Texas.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.442]  They are seizing 8,000 miles of roads in Texas.
[00:42:31.602 --> 00:42:32.862]  Over 1,000 miles in Indiana.
[00:42:37.066 --> 00:42:39.168]  Over 700 miles in Oklahoma.
[00:42:40.869 --> 00:42:46.814]  They're taking highways over in California, Nevada, Idaho.
[00:42:47.694 --> 00:42:58.443]  They're taking 83 federal highways over, and then designating them part of the Tanamex-Napa Superhighway
[00:42:59.497 --> 00:42:59.937]  And others.
[00:42:59.957 --> 00:43:03.378]  Just go to TxDOT, go to the Canadian Parliament, go to the Canadian states.
[00:43:03.838 --> 00:43:04.899]  They all have it out there.
[00:43:04.919 --> 00:43:08.440]  And so people keep saying, where's the big super highway?
[00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:18.483]  TxDOT said 10 years ago, the Feds reported 10 years ago, we have all the maps, the news reports, Newsweek, Time, magazine covers.
[00:43:19.415 --> 00:43:24.118]  Where they say the government, you know, three years ago was still admitting they were going to do this.
[00:43:24.178 --> 00:43:27.340]  Then opposition mounted and so they backed off and said it didn't exist.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.102]  About how they're going to expand I-35.
[00:43:32.223 --> 00:43:40.328]  And how they're going to expand arterial roads on the sides of it that feed into it as part of this entire transportation grid.
[00:43:40.908 --> 00:43:45.711]  And how they're going to use money collected from tolls in the United States off existing roads.
[00:43:50.168 --> 00:43:53.690]  To then build highways into Mexico.
[00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:56.531]  Okay, so it's about taxation.
[00:43:57.031 --> 00:43:59.553]  The big issue is about the taxation.
[00:44:00.493 --> 00:44:14.860]  The big issue is about, these are international zones, and the internal ports, the inland ports in Kansas City, San Antonio, Dallas, Texas, those are under international control.
[00:44:15.808 --> 00:44:18.229]  Remember how they internationalized the Panama Canal?
[00:44:18.369 --> 00:44:23.430]  Why did they give China the Panama Canal in 1980?
[00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.351]  Why was it completely handed over in 2000 to the Chinese military?
[00:44:28.931 --> 00:44:29.551]  To Costco?
[00:44:31.072 --> 00:44:32.632]  Chinese oceanic shipping concern?
[00:44:34.413 --> 00:44:36.653]  Because it's part of the carving up of globalization.
[00:44:36.673 --> 00:44:39.794]  They give each other different pieces of infrastructure.
[00:44:39.954 --> 00:44:41.934]  The globalists say, well, we're going to own most of China.
[00:44:42.375 --> 00:44:44.215]  You can come in here and own our infrastructure.
[00:44:45.523 --> 00:44:47.424]  They call it interdependence or globalism.
[00:44:51.547 --> 00:44:52.887]  And so, that's what's happening.
[00:44:55.449 --> 00:44:57.050]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Oregon.
[00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:57.810]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:45:01.752 --> 00:45:02.413]  Hello, Mark!
[00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:03.734]  Hey, Alex.
[00:45:04.054 --> 00:45:04.234]  Hi.
[00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:33.437]  Alex, I've got two things I'd like to just run past you real quick, and one of them is really just a thank you from me, and I think really from all constitutional, patriotic, true Americans, that I know this is not about you, this is about the job that you're doing, getting the information out to us to expose evil, but you've put your life on the line for a long time, and you've done it on behalf of all of our welfare, and I just wanted to thank you, and God bless you, because as Jesus said,
[00:45:34.634 --> 00:45:38.857]  No man has a greater love than this, that he would lay his life down for others.
[00:45:38.897 --> 00:45:41.399]  And you've laid your life down, essentially, for the whole world.
[00:45:41.719 --> 00:45:48.063]  So you really are, I know it's not about you, but you really are the shining example of what a human being should be.
[00:45:48.083 --> 00:45:51.986]  And I just thank you on behalf of all of us, really.
[00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:54.142]  Well, that's very kind of you.
[00:45:54.162 --> 00:45:56.303]  I mean, I don't want to be put on a pedestal.
[00:45:56.363 --> 00:46:00.585]  I'm still worldly, and I'm still a fallen creature, creation.
[00:46:01.566 --> 00:46:06.548]  But, I mean, I just see a threat by very wicked killers, and it's my job to stand up and fight them.
[00:46:06.909 --> 00:46:09.030]  But it's not all of us together standing up.
[00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.910]  That's right.
[00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:11.491]  I understand that.
[00:46:11.751 --> 00:46:22.097]  And it is so overwhelming as the evil increases exponentially in very short time frames as we live now and into the near future.
[00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:34.329]  I think that most of us, at least I know for myself, that I'm really basically lost as to what to do about it outside of relating it to other people, which I've been doing for more than about three decades.
[00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:41.754]  I'm right in your mindset and everything else, but you have the ability and the enthusiasm.
[00:46:41.794 --> 00:46:42.795]  You have the intellect.
[00:46:42.875 --> 00:46:44.476]  It's just who you are.
[00:46:45.477 --> 00:46:50.000]  You know how to put it all together and to infuse enthusiasm into us all.
[00:46:51.505 --> 00:46:57.424]  Very important because I don't know of anyone else that's doing that in the whole world and I really do cover a lot of media.
[00:46:58.493 --> 00:47:06.354]  Alex, beyond that, I just wanted to mention that if you haven't had any experience with the healing effects of pure oil of oregano.
[00:47:06.374 --> 00:47:07.535]  No, I have.
[00:47:07.755 --> 00:47:10.655]  In fact, I had some around the office and somebody took it home.
[00:47:11.315 --> 00:47:13.016]  And I know it's really powerful.
[00:47:13.636 --> 00:47:16.896]  In fact, I'm going to send somebody to Whole Foods to buy me another bottle of it.
[00:47:17.256 --> 00:47:20.957]  Okay, it will knock it out within 24 hours if you take it sublingually.
[00:47:20.997 --> 00:47:22.817]  I only get sick a few times a year.
[00:47:22.837 --> 00:47:26.338]  Keep your immune system up.
[00:47:26.958 --> 00:47:32.959]  Sure, and so once I get sick I kind of forget about even trying to treat it and just wish that it was gone.
[00:47:32.979 --> 00:47:37.600]  Because it's hard working when you feel like this, but thank you sir for the call.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.021]  Yeah, speak of corruption increasing.
[00:47:41.041 --> 00:47:43.041]  Speaking of backstabbing increasing.
[00:47:45.402 --> 00:47:49.543]  Do you know what's going to happen when the economy fully implodes?
[00:47:51.083 --> 00:47:54.624]  And when you got Alan Greenspan coming out saying, we're about to have stagflation.
[00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:15.297]  And when you've got the credit card subprime situation unraveling, and it's all tied together, not just the subprime and the lending crisis, I mean, they take the debt of credit cards and securitize that and leverage that out ten times, and they leverage that out ten times.
[00:48:17.878 --> 00:48:20.739]  This is the equivalent of fiscal Armageddon.
[00:48:22.951 --> 00:48:26.474]  And, you know, neighbors you thought were your friends, family you thought you could trust.
[00:48:27.234 --> 00:48:34.099]  When things get bad in the economy, things get bad in your personal life, in business.
[00:48:34.579 --> 00:48:43.745]  You know, the military will take an illegal alien, they'll take an aggravated felon for their ranks, but they will not take someone who's got bad credit because they found they will steal.
[00:48:43.765 --> 00:48:50.830]  And a lot of companies won't do that now, so it's going to kind of be a form of debtor prison where you're not going to be able to get a job if you have bad credit.
[00:48:52.729 --> 00:48:59.736]  And we've never had such a financial bubble that has expanded to anything near this.
[00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:03.079]  I mean, this is thousands of times bigger than anything ever dreamed.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.624]  And the economy's already in trouble, despite media propaganda saying it's all about roses.
[00:49:09.105 --> 00:49:11.387]  And I'm already seeing more and more cutthroat activities.
[00:49:12.228 --> 00:49:14.570]  I'm already seeing just all sorts of things happen.
[00:49:15.453 --> 00:49:28.697]  And I'm going to just advise listeners, those of you that have some money, you better watch your money, you better watch your stockbrokers, you better watch your lawyers, you better watch your family, you better watch your employees, you better watch everybody.
[00:49:30.258 --> 00:49:33.119]  Because let me tell you something, and I'm not just looking for the bad in the world.
[00:49:33.499 --> 00:49:35.720]  Society is going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:40.521]  I mean, it is unraveling fast.
[00:49:44.986 --> 00:49:48.789]  There's still a lot of good in the world, and the worst brings out the best in us.
[00:49:48.809 --> 00:49:51.491]  When things get tough, that's when people finally shine.
[00:49:53.072 --> 00:50:01.819]  I mean, we had about 80% of the population that was bankrupt in the Great Depression, but they still had little pieces of land and could grow food and were self-sufficient.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:12.988]  Do you know what these yuppies and what all these people are going to do and how they're going to behave and how they're going to act when they find out their house is worthless, when they find out their dollar has been turned into toilet paper?
[00:50:13.655 --> 00:50:16.116]  When they find out that there's no more credit to leverage out.
[00:50:18.116 --> 00:50:21.317]  I told the story about the swan delivery guy out to my uncle in the country.
[00:50:21.777 --> 00:50:28.538]  They're talking about not even being able to do their route anymore because nobody's got money to buy anything anymore.
[00:50:29.078 --> 00:50:33.919]  Because everybody's leveraged out on their credit cards and has to have the money they got for gas just to go to work.
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:38.660]  You know, a delivery truck brings you pizzas and chicken and frozen stuff.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.501]  I don't know if swans are all over the country.
[00:50:42.333 --> 00:50:44.055]  But, uh, I mean, it's, it's real.
[00:50:46.296 --> 00:50:49.099]  And, uh, it's serious.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.022]  Alright, uh, Dave and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[00:50:53.042 --> 00:50:56.745]  I do have a bunch of audio clips, news, and Kevin Booth coming up in studio.
[00:50:57.086 --> 00:51:01.069]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:03.331]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:04.392 --> 00:51:05.453]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.173 --> 00:51:10.357]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power called God.
[00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:12.811]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:51:12.831 --> 00:51:16.092]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.653 --> 00:51:19.094]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.814 --> 00:51:27.157]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.169 --> 00:51:35.152]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.632 --> 00:51:39.073]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.474 --> 00:51:41.995]  Bill of Rights makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.055 --> 00:51:43.195]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.235 --> 00:51:43.976]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.996 --> 00:51:45.056]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.276 --> 00:51:46.037]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.277 --> 00:51:47.097]  That's what they're after.

[00:52:09.086 --> 00:52:13.427]  Alarming words for our time, but how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:13.787 --> 00:52:20.469]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne

[00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:28.103]  I'm not going to belabor this, but there is still time to give the gift of truth this Christmas.

[00:54:39.517 --> 00:54:41.118]  We just put up two new reports there.
[00:54:41.558 --> 00:54:43.378]  The interview with George Humphrey on the economy.
[00:54:43.939 --> 00:54:45.339]  And then my TV show last week.
[00:54:45.879 --> 00:54:48.300]  It's all up there on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.002]  Thousands and thousands of pieces of media.
[00:54:52.642 --> 00:54:53.942]  And it's $5.95 a month.
[00:54:53.962 --> 00:54:56.123]  The cost of really two cups of Starbucks coffee.
[00:54:56.443 --> 00:54:59.204]  For the same price as we started it three and a half years ago.
[00:54:59.924 --> 00:55:01.085]  More than three and a half years ago.
[00:55:01.125 --> 00:55:04.126]  Coming up on four years for Prison Planet in April.

[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.863]  A particular TV show, a particular radio interview, my films.
[00:55:27.464 --> 00:55:29.626]  It is an armory of resistance.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.103]  It is a great way to reach out to people.
[00:55:34.183 --> 00:55:36.444]  It's a wonderful way to wake people up.

[00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:16.210]  Perfect to give a skeptic.
[00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:17.511]  Oh, there's no global elite.
[00:56:17.851 --> 00:56:18.912]  There's no establishment.
[00:56:20.193 --> 00:56:21.994]  Americans love to think they're the boss.
[00:56:22.094 --> 00:56:23.555]  Love to think that they run everything.
[00:56:24.355 --> 00:56:26.096]  Well, Americans should run things.
[00:56:26.477 --> 00:56:28.518]  We should run our country, but we don't right now.
[00:56:29.359 --> 00:56:29.459]  Okay.
[00:56:29.479 --> 00:56:31.140]  I mean, that's really what it comes down to.
[00:56:32.121 --> 00:56:40.327]  We're a bunch of arrogant, self-serving, fat, myself included, know-it-alls who don't know very much.
[00:56:41.288 --> 00:56:44.711]  And I'm here to tell you, you better get informed and realize just how much trouble we're in.
[00:56:46.032 --> 00:56:47.593]  Let's go to J.T.
[00:56:47.673 --> 00:56:48.593]  in Colorado.
[00:56:48.654 --> 00:56:49.514]  J.T., welcome.
[00:56:50.435 --> 00:56:52.116]  Well, Merry Christmas, Alex.
[00:56:52.556 --> 00:56:53.137]  How you doing, sir?
[00:56:53.598 --> 00:56:54.318]  I'm doing well.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:07.046]  On that Huckabee quote, yesterday on the Situation Room they had a little deal about that.
[00:57:07.927 --> 00:57:18.153]  It's kind of a COINTELPRO prelude to what happened on Glenn Beck last night.
[00:57:18.174 --> 00:57:20.415]  They voiced up a story that people
[00:57:21.058 --> 00:57:34.990]  We're saying that Huckabee was sending subliminal messages to Christians with the white cross-shaped bookcase in his Christmas TV ad for the people in Iowa.
[00:57:36.231 --> 00:57:39.673]  And they ran that story in the Situation Room.
[00:57:40.754 --> 00:57:48.180]  And what Huckabee did, you know, in his usual, I'm trying to be slick, Willie, and I'm really
[00:57:50.984 --> 00:57:54.125]  Yeah, that's the issue, is that he's openly threatening Ron Paul.
[00:57:54.205 --> 00:57:56.586]  Yeah, I mean, right there, 4 minutes and 55 seconds.
[00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:18.571]  Send that to Paul Watson.
[00:58:18.591 --> 00:58:19.592]  We've got to get an article out.
[00:58:19.632 --> 00:58:20.413]  That's even worse.
[00:58:20.973 --> 00:58:22.875]  I didn't know that it was Huckabee saying that.
[00:58:23.235 --> 00:58:24.516]  And so that's why they were playing it.
[00:58:24.577 --> 00:58:25.617]  That is even worse.
[00:58:26.018 --> 00:58:26.859]  Stay there, JT.
[00:58:26.899 --> 00:58:27.859]  I want to hear more about this.
[00:58:29.581 --> 00:58:31.002]  This is absolutely amazing.
[00:58:31.663 --> 00:58:35.466]  And again, the media is creating false hype around Huckabee and how he's the big winner.
[00:58:36.087 --> 00:58:39.029]  Because they know he's got all these skeletons that can be brought down very quickly.
[00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:42.733]  Thank you for listening to GPN.
[00:58:47.137 --> 00:58:49.358]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.698 --> 00:58:51.898]  What?
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:58.640]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.261 --> 00:59:00.361]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.021 --> 00:59:02.141]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.782 --> 00:59:03.562]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.366 --> 00:59:06.267]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.287 --> 00:59:09.587]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.108 --> 00:59:14.209]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.831 --> 00:59:32.994]  Yeah, if you go to prisonplanet.com, into the story we have posted, because we're getting a bunch of calls from the network about this,
[00:59:34.409 --> 00:59:41.593]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com and you click on Glenn Beck Show Scrolls Paul is Dead message during interview.
[00:59:41.773 --> 00:59:43.374]  People are having trouble believing this.
[00:59:44.175 --> 00:59:49.938]  Well, all you have to do is go to the website and watch the YouTube video clip and John timed it out.
[00:59:49.998 --> 00:59:50.879]  John, it's what?
[00:59:50.919 --> 00:59:51.499]  Two minutes in?
[00:59:51.519 --> 00:59:56.262]  Yeah, it's about two minutes in and they scrolled.
[00:59:57.324 --> 00:59:59.085]  Paul is dead, Paul is dead, Paul is dead.
[00:59:59.566 --> 01:00:11.335]  And then since then I've Googled it and it did confirm that Huckabee did indeed say that earlier in the day, that yeah, if you play my campaign ad backwards, it says Paul is dead, Paul is dead, Paul is dead.
[01:00:12.416 --> 01:00:16.939]  I mean, the point is, is that why do we suddenly have all this discussion about Ron Paul dying?
[01:00:16.959 --> 01:00:22.724]  You know, Daniel Esselstyn comes out and says he has intelligence sources that says the elite are considering killing him.
[01:00:24.238 --> 01:00:28.982]  Then Huckabee, who's definitely an insider, comes out and says, Paul is dead, Paul is dead, Paul is dead.
[01:00:30.363 --> 01:00:43.233]  Ron Paul admits that he knows that he is in danger, that things like this are a real threat, and then some of his own supporters run around on the web saying, no, it's not kosher to discuss even what Ron Paul says.
[01:00:43.614 --> 01:00:45.815]  We have to censor ourselves more than he does.
[01:00:47.016 --> 01:00:48.978]  We have to basically become George Bushes.
[01:00:51.132 --> 01:00:53.213]  They're scared of Ron Paul, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.254]  He's trending to win.
[01:00:54.314 --> 01:00:58.016]  He's trending higher than Jimmy Carter, who ended up getting the nomination at this time.
[01:00:58.056 --> 01:01:02.499]  He's trending higher than Dukakis, who was getting 1% going into New Hampshire.
[01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:06.301]  Bill Clinton lost some of the first primaries.
[01:01:08.922 --> 01:01:11.424]  But see, the establishment has gotten behind Huckabee.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.122]  And of course that's behind there to beat a cross as they scroll.
[01:01:16.643 --> 01:01:18.384]  But again, it's not about being a real Christian.
[01:01:18.404 --> 01:01:19.465]  It's about the symbols.
[01:01:20.025 --> 01:01:21.526]  Symbols above substance.
[01:01:23.787 --> 01:01:27.790]  And then the media gets to cover it and go, oh look, is it okay for him to show his Christian values?
[01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:30.151]  And then Christians think, oh, he's good!
[01:01:31.172 --> 01:01:36.936]  And then Huckabee Doe talks about, you know, all the mind control conspiracies dealing with the Beatles and, you know,
[01:01:37.665 --> 01:01:42.926]  Paul is dead, Paul is dead, Paul is dead, which goes back to comments about Paul McCartney.
[01:01:43.627 --> 01:01:45.387]  Paul Watts is going to do a story about this.
[01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:48.088]  The point is, this is all bizarre.
[01:01:48.128 --> 01:01:53.289]  Going back to JT, JT, I found a mention of Huckabee saying it.
[01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:55.490]  Where is the particular YouTube clip?
[01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:59.331]  I didn't see it on a YouTube clip.
[01:01:59.451 --> 01:02:01.372]  I did tape it last night.
[01:02:01.412 --> 01:02:06.333]  It was on the Situation Room in the second hour, and John King was subbing
[01:02:07.031 --> 01:02:32.326]  For Wolf Blitzer and they ran this little, oh it was probably six or seven minutes long on Huckabee and at the end of it he makes that witty little comment about you play it backwards and there will be those people out there that will say, oh it says Paul is dead, Paul is dead, Paul is dead and everybody chuckles and they have this and then they broke to a commercial.
[01:02:33.849 --> 01:02:36.091]  I haven't seen it on YouTube.
[01:02:36.651 --> 01:02:48.779]  Some of the guys that are real savvy with that stuff could probably go out there and find it real quick by Googling Situation Room second hour or something.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.681]  Somebody might have put it up.
[01:02:52.421 --> 01:02:54.322]  Or Huckabee Situation Room.
[01:02:54.823 --> 01:02:55.603]  Yeah, that would work.
[01:02:55.963 --> 01:02:56.464]  That would work.
[01:02:57.724 --> 01:03:02.608]  The thing with the people, especially over on RonPaulForums.com,
[01:03:03.567 --> 01:03:17.775]  They are clamping down so tightly on people talking about the possibility of the elite going after Ron Paul or assassinating him that they don't realize that they're playing right into their hands.
[01:03:18.535 --> 01:03:26.320]  The more this is out there, the more people will realize that it's happening and the less likely the buggers are to do it.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.522]  Can you cue that up on your television to the part where he says it and play it over the speaker?
[01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:32.810]  Um, oh gosh.
[01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.491]  I'm not even where I could do that right now, Alex.
[01:03:35.531 --> 01:03:35.952]  I understand.
[01:03:35.972 --> 01:03:39.133]  Well, somebody needs to get it to us and post it in the Prison Planet forums.
[01:03:39.654 --> 01:03:40.814]  Thanks for the call, uh, T.J.
[01:03:40.914 --> 01:03:45.297]  And I got somebody emailing me saying, it's talking about Paul McCartney.
[01:03:46.457 --> 01:03:48.518]  I didn't say Ron Paul is dead, I said Paul is dead.
[01:03:48.538 --> 01:03:50.099]  They're clearly talking about Ron Paul.
[01:03:50.419 --> 01:03:51.240]  It's a pun!
[01:03:53.821 --> 01:03:55.242]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:56.322 --> 01:03:57.303]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:02.154]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:02.194 --> 01:04:04.797]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:04:04.917 --> 01:04:08.020]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.002]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.763 --> 01:04:19.090]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.105 --> 01:04:27.088]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:31.011]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.411 --> 01:04:33.913]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:33.973 --> 01:04:34.954]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:34.974 --> 01:04:35.894]  They're not after money.
[01:04:35.934 --> 01:04:36.995]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.195 --> 01:04:37.956]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.196 --> 01:04:39.457]  That's what they're after usually.

[01:06:41.727 --> 01:06:45.390]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.195 --> 01:07:16.858]  All right, let's try to move quicker here.
[01:07:16.898 --> 01:07:18.178]  Dave in New York.
[01:07:19.019 --> 01:07:21.640]  Have we already talked to Dave in New York?
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.460]  Who are we talking to right now?
[01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:24.781]  Pardon me?
[01:07:25.421 --> 01:07:25.721]  Pardon me?
[01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:28.562]  All right, Steve in New York.
[01:07:28.602 --> 01:07:29.203]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:07:29.223 --> 01:07:31.644]  It's actually Stewart.
[01:07:31.764 --> 01:07:35.125]  Alex, I watched the Lundbeck Show last night, actually.
[01:07:35.942 --> 01:07:42.246]  At first, I was very surprised to see how polite and nice he seemed to be, agreeing with Dr. Paul on almost everything.
[01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:45.348]  And then, a little siren went off in the back of my head.
[01:07:45.368 --> 01:07:46.808]  You know, something isn't right.
[01:07:46.848 --> 01:07:48.489]  He's setting Ron Paul up for something.
[01:07:48.509 --> 01:07:51.311]  And sure enough, it was the 9-11 issue.
[01:07:51.811 --> 01:07:57.355]  And it seems like he drove the 9-11 spike right through the heart of the movement.
[01:07:57.595 --> 01:08:03.178]  And by appearances, anyway, Ron Paul used a hammer on it.
[01:08:05.225 --> 01:08:22.969]  I'm just wondering, in your opinion, do you feel that the reason why he didn't even suggest that at least we should consider a reassembly of an impartial commission to investigate the 9-11 disaster was because of this life-threatening issue?
[01:08:24.489 --> 01:08:32.471]  I don't know, but I have to say this, Stuart, that Ron Paul, in other times he's been questioned about it, says, well, there should be a new investigation,
[01:08:33.174 --> 01:08:35.616]  You know, the government does lie to us and cover things up.
[01:08:36.137 --> 01:08:40.240]  And then he'll add, but no, I think the evidence shows we were attacked by the cave dwellers.
[01:08:41.482 --> 01:08:42.843]  And then he tries to use it against them.
[01:08:43.263 --> 01:08:48.548]  And yeah, watching this, he just kind of said, no, you know, I don't believe in what they're saying.
[01:08:48.628 --> 01:08:50.249]  I'm, you know, I'm not part of that.
[01:08:50.650 --> 01:08:55.534]  And then a lot of people in our movement are now saying, well, we know it's an inside job, but we're just not going to talk about it anymore ourselves.
[01:08:56.055 --> 01:08:58.437]  And that plays right into the New World Order's hands.
[01:08:59.598 --> 01:09:04.302]  I mean, if you know it's an inside job, you can't self-censor yourself and not talk about it.
[01:09:04.743 --> 01:09:08.706]  Ron Paul is playing politics, just like he did on The View, backtracking on abortion.
[01:09:09.427 --> 01:09:14.050]  And I don't like seeing this, and I don't like you even asking me about it, but it's your right to do it.
[01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:16.172]  I don't like having to answer you honestly.
[01:09:18.034 --> 01:09:20.776]  And I understand why you're asking the question, too.
[01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:25.320]  It's not good, and if this stuff continues,
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.741]  For much longer, I'm not going to be too happy with it.
[01:09:30.521 --> 01:09:33.681]  To be honest with you, Alex, I was livid over the situation.
[01:09:33.721 --> 01:09:50.285]  All we had to do was say, well, in light of the fact that the people on the commission themselves have flat-out stated that they were lied to and obfuscated, you could have turned it around to a question and said, oh, Mr. Glenn, in light of that, don't you think we should at least reassemble an impartial investigation?
[01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:52.445]  And Glenn Peck would have been put on the spot.
[01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:57.560]  Because when the people on the commission are saying that they were lied to and obfuscated, I mean...
[01:09:58.328 --> 01:10:00.690]  That's cause for at least a reinvestigation.
[01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:02.191]  He doesn't have to say it's an inside job.
[01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:06.775]  Well, what's happening is it's been six years since a new administration is going to come in.
[01:10:06.815 --> 01:10:08.476]  The system wants to put it to bed.
[01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:11.258]  They've even said they want to stop using it in the media.
[01:10:11.278 --> 01:10:14.320]  You know, the mainstream media said, is it time to stop reporting?
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.822]  Is it the time to stop using it?
[01:10:16.242 --> 01:10:18.283]  Is it the time to stop making such a big deal out of it?
[01:10:18.524 --> 01:10:19.805]  They've gotten their police state.
[01:10:19.825 --> 01:10:25.349]  They've gotten their face scanning cameras in the shopping malls and license plate scanners on the streets, except on the border.
[01:10:25.985 --> 01:10:36.384]  And they've gotten what they need now and now we're supposed to just shut up and just let them get away with killing 2,800 of us so Hillary or whoever else can stage another big attack once she gets in.
[01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:46.722]  And yeah, we're supposed to say we're all bad for being bold and intelligent and informed and putting ourselves on the line and demonstrating and exposing it as an inside job.
[01:10:47.082 --> 01:10:48.363]  All of our courage is bad.
[01:10:48.423 --> 01:10:49.784]  Everything we've done is dirty.
[01:10:50.685 --> 01:10:51.605]  We're not good.
[01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:53.466]  And it's really sick.
[01:10:53.787 --> 01:10:57.369]  I mean, we have the Italian president.
[01:10:58.371 --> 01:11:05.796]  One of the longest-serving, most respected, the former head of their intelligence agency, going public saying, our government staged 9-11.
[01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:09.219]  And that all the major intelligence agencies know it.
[01:11:09.559 --> 01:11:11.941]  We have the head of the German Parliament coming out and saying it.
[01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:15.623]  We have Robert Baer saying the evidence points towards it being an inside job.
[01:11:15.923 --> 01:11:20.647]  Bill Christensen, CIA Section Chief of Europe, saying he believes it's a total inside job.
[01:11:20.987 --> 01:11:23.929]  Ray McGovern, the CIA briefer, for
[01:11:26.613 --> 01:11:28.093]  Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[01:11:28.113 --> 01:11:30.374]  saying the evidence points towards inside job.
[01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:34.715]  And it is very hurtful, but again, the media keeps bringing it up, bringing it up.
[01:11:35.555 --> 01:11:40.956]  And, you know, Ron Paul also has looked very exhausted on these last few programs.
[01:11:40.976 --> 01:11:42.316]  A little bit out of it, he's been working so much.
[01:11:42.636 --> 01:11:43.557]  Looks like he has a cold.
[01:11:44.697 --> 01:11:46.297]  And, you know, he's gotten a bit dingy.
[01:11:46.797 --> 01:11:49.558]  I mean, he didn't even hardly know he was on Fox News the other day when they went to him.
[01:11:50.516 --> 01:11:52.977]  I'll make the call right now, Ron Paul, at least call for a new investigation.
[01:11:52.998 --> 01:12:00.021]  You don't have to say that it was an inside job, but dammit, call for a new investigation and you'll even have more supporters.
[01:12:19.443 --> 01:12:25.025]  Well, I mean, 84% of the American people in Angus and Reed National Poll believe that they've been lied to about 9-11.
[01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:25.685]  Exactly!
[01:12:25.725 --> 01:12:29.327]  So it's no longer a liability to come out and say something like that.
[01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:36.609]  Well, but see, even if the public isn't trusting, still the media would make a big deal out of it and say he was, you know, crazy.
[01:12:37.349 --> 01:12:41.071]  And he's got so much positive news right now that he's playing politics.
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:51.182]  You know, I mean, when Ron Paul comes on this show, he says, you know, they could stage an event, without me prompting, and he said it like five times, they could stage something like the Gulf of Tonkin!
[01:12:51.682 --> 01:12:53.503]  I'm really worried about staging a provocation!
[01:12:54.463 --> 01:13:06.166]  I mean, Bush, admittedly, in the White House Memo, just Google White House Memo, mainstream news said that he wanted to... said that he wanted to get a U.S.
[01:13:06.206 --> 01:13:08.107]  aircraft flying low, like a U.N.
[01:13:08.127 --> 01:13:13.068]  plane shot down, you know, to get the war going, and Ron Paul's talked about that.
[01:13:13.832 --> 01:13:23.881]  And I think he could say, oh no, I don't know about 9-11, but I do know we staged the situation to get into Iran in 53, I know about the talk of the start of the Vietnam War in 64.
[01:13:23.981 --> 01:13:25.342]  He's done that in the past.
[01:13:26.123 --> 01:13:28.525]  Now he's just going, nope, nothing to it.
[01:13:29.586 --> 01:13:32.948]  And so, when we get Ron Paul back on, I'll bring that up to him.
[01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:34.390]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:35.551]  Thank you for everything.
[01:13:35.571 --> 01:13:36.532]  Yeah, thank you, my friend.
[01:13:36.572 --> 01:13:38.713]  No, it's irritating me, too.
[01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:43.825]  You know, we're good to give our money.
[01:13:44.465 --> 01:13:45.725]  We're good to get out on the street.
[01:13:45.765 --> 01:13:46.566]  We go to these events.
[01:13:46.686 --> 01:13:52.948]  Ted goes to events up in Minnesota, and it's mainly my listeners, 9-11 truthers, that are the Ron Paul core up there.
[01:13:53.248 --> 01:13:53.908]  We are the core.
[01:13:54.248 --> 01:13:54.869]  We started it.
[01:13:54.909 --> 01:13:55.429]  We pushed it.
[01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:57.270]  We're still the largest subsection.
[01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:01.711]  And it's kind of like mainline Republicans are saying, all right, you snot-nosed punks.
[01:14:02.151 --> 01:14:02.972]  Now step aside.
[01:14:03.032 --> 01:14:03.852]  We're running the show.
[01:14:06.053 --> 01:14:07.093]  Well, that's not going to happen.
[01:14:08.395 --> 01:14:11.899]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Texas.
[01:14:11.919 --> 01:14:12.440]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:14:13.121 --> 01:14:20.409]  Yeah, Alex, I think it's good that you're like a primer for Dr. Paul and getting him to
[01:14:21.403 --> 01:14:24.864]  I mean, it's nice that you have him on your show from time to time, and he can be like a primer for that.
[01:14:24.904 --> 01:14:25.444]  He needs that.
[01:14:25.764 --> 01:14:27.224]  Every candidate that ever runs needs somebody else.
[01:14:27.244 --> 01:14:31.786]  Well, he doesn't need us anymore, but I mean, the point is, is that I like Ron Paul.
[01:14:31.806 --> 01:14:32.986]  He has a great voting record.
[01:14:33.006 --> 01:14:39.688]  I mean, he's a once-in-a-lifetime candidate, but at the same time, the abortion thing freaked me out, and this is freaking me out.
[01:14:40.808 --> 01:14:46.689]  Yeah, I want to get to the reason I called was last night on Tavis Smiley's show on PBS.
[01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:47.730]  Rob Reiner was on.
[01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:48.510]  Have you heard about this?
[01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:49.310]  No.
[01:14:49.989 --> 01:14:56.513]  And he goes, and he's talking about, he's stumping for his candidate, Hillary Clinton, because he's a lifelong Hollywood liberal.
[01:14:57.093 --> 01:15:08.780]  So he goes, well, she really knows the three things you need to know to move an agenda forward in politics, and understanding public policy and the things you've got to do, and he's really just singing her praises.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:15.504]  Then Thomas Smiley says, well, a lot of people are scrambled with politics these days, and how do you keep so upbeat about being in politics?
[01:15:15.524 --> 01:15:17.545]  And he goes, well, because this
[01:15:18.575 --> 01:15:20.557]  Because, you know, this is all we have.
[01:15:20.677 --> 01:15:23.939]  This political system we have, and it's good or bad or different.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.563]  We have the Constitution, and it's, you know, it's talking about how great the Constitution is.
[01:15:29.904 --> 01:15:34.187]  We've strayed from, you know, the basics of the Constitution the last seven years.
[01:15:34.207 --> 01:15:41.673]  We've been throwing out habeas corpus and our civil liberties by the highest levels of government.
[01:15:42.734 --> 01:15:45.276]  But that bedrock document of the Constitution is still there.
[01:15:45.296 --> 01:15:45.776]  I'm quoting him.
[01:15:46.704 --> 01:15:50.787]  Well, if he just went and talked about what a great person Hillary Clinton is, is she the one that voted?
[01:15:50.867 --> 01:15:53.969]  Didn't she vote along with everybody else, the rest of the cattle in Congress?
[01:15:53.989 --> 01:15:54.809]  Absolutely.
[01:15:54.989 --> 01:15:57.711]  Whatever powers Reagan accrued were passed to Bush.
[01:15:57.751 --> 01:16:00.513]  Whatever powers Bush accrued were passed to Clinton.
[01:16:00.893 --> 01:16:03.615]  Whatever Clinton had was passed to Bush, too.
[01:16:04.355 --> 01:16:05.296]  And it's the same thing.
[01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:16.043]  How this guy can go on there and talk about how we've had our civil liberties plundered when the very tool they used to plunder was with the Military Commissions Act and Patriot Act and this lady voted for
[01:16:17.051 --> 01:16:18.052]  If not one, both of them.
[01:16:18.132 --> 01:16:24.397]  I don't even know if she was a senator during the Patriot Act years, but she definitely voted for the Military Commissions Act.
[01:16:24.417 --> 01:16:27.500]  No, she voted for the Patriot Act.
[01:16:28.441 --> 01:16:31.603]  I mean, right there, he needs to be called out for that.
[01:16:31.643 --> 01:16:45.415]  They only call our candidates out on the stupidest little things that mean nothing, and this guy goes out there and just talks about what a great candidate she is, and right there, there's a glaring, I mean,
[01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:47.671]  Anyway, that's the point I wanted to make.
[01:16:47.691 --> 01:16:49.412]  Also, I've written an article on this.
[01:16:49.632 --> 01:16:52.053]  You've always encouraged your listeners to write articles.
[01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:58.977]  I tried to last night, but is there an email address I can send it to?
[01:16:59.638 --> 01:17:02.719]  Yes, send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com with two As.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.901]  Right, that's what the answerer said.
[01:17:06.161 --> 01:17:08.443]  Okay, thank you very much.
[01:17:08.823 --> 01:17:09.403]  Thank you, sir.
[01:17:09.443 --> 01:17:10.464]  I appreciate your call.
[01:17:11.464 --> 01:17:12.765]  Let's jam one more in here.
[01:17:12.785 --> 01:17:15.407]  Let's talk to Robert in North Carolina.
[01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:15.867]  You're on the air.
[01:17:16.485 --> 01:17:20.789]  Yeah, I was going to talk to you about the Glenn Beck thing as well.
[01:17:20.809 --> 01:17:35.703]  I liked what the other caller was saying about how he was disappointed in what Ron Paul's answers were and I kind of agree that he was probably under a lot of pressure from doing a lot of interviews and hopefully that was why he wasn't real sharp with a more clear answer.
[01:17:35.743 --> 01:17:40.668]  But I think that Glenn Beck had kind of a snickering look on his face after he got into
[01:17:41.277 --> 01:17:42.938]  Sort of go against the 9-11 movement.
[01:17:43.139 --> 01:17:46.161]  Oh yeah, they know, because they know what their real threat is.
[01:17:46.201 --> 01:17:48.943]  They're scared of it, and they're hoping this will blunt it.
[01:17:49.764 --> 01:17:52.786]  And then all these know-it-all Republican hacks and Libertarian hacks.
[01:17:52.806 --> 01:17:57.130]  I hope you enjoy the next attack, because if we don't expose this, it's over.
[01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:06.217]  Yeah, and I think it was, you know, Glenn Beck was happy to kind of divide the movement into, you know, Kool-Aid drinkers and twofers, you know.
[01:18:07.029 --> 01:18:17.712]  And he kind of wants us to sort of go at each other in a respect to divide us up, but we've got to stay strong and put him in, because he's the one that's going to allow us to have the debates that we need to have to straighten things up.
[01:18:18.392 --> 01:18:19.792]  Ron Paul's a wonderful candidate.
[01:18:19.832 --> 01:18:20.793]  I'm firmly behind him.
[01:18:21.133 --> 01:18:23.053]  And he's injecting real issues into the debate.
[01:18:24.013 --> 01:18:27.714]  But this was not a good response from him.
[01:18:28.195 --> 01:18:31.675]  Because I can use his past things about how well they do stage provocations.
[01:18:32.596 --> 01:18:33.296]  Well, they do.
[01:18:35.129 --> 01:18:36.970]  You know, use these things to take our rights.
[01:18:37.631 --> 01:18:40.593]  Well, they have lied to us in the past, so we need a new investigation.
[01:18:41.234 --> 01:18:41.794]  None of that!
[01:18:41.894 --> 01:18:45.156]  Just... 180 degrees from that.
[01:18:47.358 --> 01:18:49.079]  But I think Ron Paul is infallible.
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:50.721]  So we shouldn't question.
[01:18:50.821 --> 01:18:51.381]  I'm joking.
[01:18:51.781 --> 01:18:52.382]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.502 --> 01:18:56.925]  Ted Anders from Midas December 19, 2007 Gold 830 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $824.47, $406.35 per half, $203.18 per quarter.
[01:18:56.985 --> 01:18:57.585]  That's $824.47, $406.35 and $203.18.
[01:19:07.426 --> 01:19:10.710]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[01:19:11.010 --> 01:19:15.214]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[01:19:15.595 --> 01:19:19.579]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.782]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[01:19:22.282 --> 01:19:23.964]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[01:19:24.244 --> 01:19:30.248]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[01:19:30.508 --> 01:19:37.292]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[01:19:37.632 --> 01:19:38.493]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[01:19:38.513 --> 01:19:38.813]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:41.814]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[01:19:42.015 --> 01:19:42.315]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:43.776]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:55.270]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:57.231]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[01:19:57.431 --> 01:20:01.452]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[01:20:01.652 --> 01:20:04.693]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[01:20:04.873 --> 01:20:08.694]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[01:20:08.854 --> 01:20:11.234]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[01:20:11.354 --> 01:20:14.615]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[01:20:14.755 --> 01:20:15.135]  We're good to go.
[01:20:30.532 --> 01:20:31.192]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.377 --> 01:20:56.399]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:20:56.719 --> 01:21:01.642]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:21:01.902 --> 01:21:06.244]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:21:06.544 --> 01:21:15.469]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:19.271]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:21:19.571 --> 01:21:24.594]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:21:24.894 --> 01:21:31.637]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:21:32.118 --> 01:21:32.658]  What about you?
[01:21:33.411 --> 01:21:38.773]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:21:53.024 --> 01:21:57.266]  The holidays are here, and that means extra food and extra weight gain.
[01:21:57.426 --> 01:21:59.946]  Why not make your New Year's resolution to eat healthier?

[01:23:02.129 --> 01:23:06.200]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio
[01:23:09.293 --> 01:23:14.376]  George Strait was singin' the seashores of old Mexico.
[01:23:15.697 --> 01:23:19.820]  It sounded so good, I got an idea.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.002]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[01:23:24.363 --> 01:23:29.166]  The long star state should be renamed Texico.
[01:23:29.186 --> 01:23:35.730]  So long Texas, hello Mexico.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:43.605]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in New York.
[01:23:44.125 --> 01:23:44.846]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:23:44.866 --> 01:23:45.146]  Welcome.
[01:23:59.870 --> 01:24:00.731]  Yes, hello Alex.
[01:24:00.751 --> 01:24:01.291]  How are you doing?
[01:24:01.331 --> 01:24:01.991]  Your show is great.
[01:24:02.011 --> 01:24:10.717]  Listen, I hear all these... We're talking about threats a lot today, and I've been threatened a lot, and it's very important that you know how to handle threats when they happen.
[01:24:10.737 --> 01:24:13.178]  So, I'd like to give you some basics for you and your audience.
[01:24:13.198 --> 01:24:17.141]  I'm sure the bad guys are listening, but they know they're punks anyway, otherwise they wouldn't be doing what they're doing.
[01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:21.563]  In the Patriot Movement, you should always have a tape recorder on you, okay?
[01:24:22.084 --> 01:24:24.085]  Because you never know where you're going to be threatened.
[01:24:24.745 --> 01:24:27.007]  Move fast, because your phone sounds like an electric razor.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:33.021]  Well, I know, it's a buzzing idea, and like I said, if they're listening, they know they're punks anyway, and that's okay.
[01:24:33.042 --> 01:24:33.762]  Just go ahead, sir.
[01:24:33.962 --> 01:24:35.902]  So you always carry your tape recorder with you.
[01:24:36.122 --> 01:24:42.424]  Now, when you have your tape recorder going, if someone is suggesting that they're threatening you, you could ask them specifically, what does that mean, sir?
[01:24:42.764 --> 01:24:43.724]  What do you plan to do to me?
[01:24:43.964 --> 01:24:44.945]  Are you going to come after me?
[01:24:45.225 --> 01:24:46.185]  Are you planning to kill me?
[01:24:46.345 --> 01:24:48.206]  When are you planning on coming after me, sir?
[01:24:48.246 --> 01:24:55.868]  You could go in that direction and try to get that for evidence, and you get what you get that, you play that everywhere, on the news, on the web, everywhere.
[01:24:57.321 --> 01:25:02.904]  You could stop it immediately by just politely informing him, Sir, I do not accept threats.
[01:25:03.444 --> 01:25:04.345]  I do not accept threats.
[01:25:04.365 --> 01:25:06.266]  So if you're threatening me, I don't accept threats.
[01:25:06.466 --> 01:25:16.231]  Now, if you want to go a little further with it, depending on your personality type, you could say, OK, and if you don't do this to me by, like it's 1.30 in New York, so if you don't do this to me by 6 p.m.
[01:25:16.991 --> 01:25:22.534]  and I'm still here tomorrow, I'm going to be out there telling the whole world that you don't have the spheres to do what you said you're going to do.
[01:25:22.714 --> 01:25:25.716]  There's many ways you can handle threats, but what I want to point out to everybody is
[01:25:26.047 --> 01:25:27.088]  It shouldn't be a negative thing.
[01:25:27.128 --> 01:25:27.948]  It's an opportunity.
[01:25:28.508 --> 01:25:34.271]  It's an opportunity either to expose them, or it's an opportunity to let them know that we are not going to accept their threats.
[01:25:34.471 --> 01:25:36.452]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call, Dave.
[01:25:36.852 --> 01:25:40.995]  Let's talk to... I keep getting these calls mixed up.
[01:25:41.015 --> 01:25:41.595]  Who's up next?
[01:25:43.296 --> 01:25:44.456]  Ray in Denver, Colorado.
[01:25:44.476 --> 01:25:44.977]  Go ahead.
[01:25:45.497 --> 01:25:46.217]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:46.297 --> 01:25:48.258]  Good to talk to you.
[01:25:48.718 --> 01:25:49.179]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:25:49.199 --> 01:25:55.502]  I'm calling from one of the headquarters of the New World Order, maybe in the future.
[01:25:57.298 --> 01:25:57.798]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:25:58.718 --> 01:26:02.780]  Well, basically, Alex, I have a couple questions for you.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:14.943]  In the next couple months, I'm going to be fortunate enough to take on my own radio show on the radio station in Denver.
[01:26:14.963 --> 01:26:16.884]  I hope it isn't on this telephone.
[01:26:16.904 --> 01:26:19.404]  Because I can't understand a word you're saying.
[01:26:19.965 --> 01:26:20.905]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:26:21.225 --> 01:26:24.306]  Basically, I just wanted to see from you what
[01:26:25.825 --> 01:26:42.180]  Well, if there are any precautions I might want to take, as far as not using my real name or anything, any advice you might have to give to me, because I'm going to be talking about some things that are not necessarily the most popular with some people here.
[01:26:42.641 --> 01:26:44.162]  Hi, Harry, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:45.063 --> 01:26:49.427]  If somebody got the idea from me on this show today, because it seems like it's a theme,
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:56.145]  About being afraid and hiding and hiding where you're at and using fake names and they're going to get us.
[01:26:56.946 --> 01:27:09.856]  We've been talking about Ron Paul and Huckabee saying Paul is dead, Paul is dead, Paul is dead when they were discussing subliminal messages in a Huckabee TV ad.
[01:27:11.557 --> 01:27:13.459]  And it's clearly directed at Ron Paul.
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:18.503]  Evidence by Glenn Beck playing that on the screen, scrolling,
[01:27:19.602 --> 01:27:20.402]  Under Ron Paul.
[01:27:22.363 --> 01:27:23.204]  But it's a pun.
[01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:25.324]  Perfect lawyer-politician pun.
[01:27:25.725 --> 01:27:28.085]  Because they can say, I'm talking about Paul McCartney.
[01:27:28.846 --> 01:27:29.126]  Really?
[01:27:29.186 --> 01:27:31.107]  Why'd you play it under Ron Paul, then?
[01:27:32.587 --> 01:27:35.368]  When that's the two guys that are, you know, running head-to-head right now.
[01:27:36.989 --> 01:27:41.091]  So, um... Let me explain something.
[01:27:41.111 --> 01:27:44.092]  Just because I get death threats, just because the New World Order
[01:27:45.658 --> 01:27:55.382]  Have national talk show hosts saying, I'm a Tim McVeigh, I'm a Charlie Manson, I need to be arrested, I need to be investigated, we need to have troops used on us.
[01:27:56.763 --> 01:27:59.924]  Just because they're doing that, that doesn't mean you.
[01:28:02.565 --> 01:28:08.668]  It's prominent people like myself, Ron Paul, and a few others that have got the biggest problems.
[01:28:08.748 --> 01:28:13.390]  This is the establishment's attempt to intimidate everybody.
[01:28:14.011 --> 01:28:15.031]  This is an attempt
[01:28:15.638 --> 01:28:16.979]  To have a chilling effect.
[01:28:17.559 --> 01:28:25.766]  And then if they win, off the fear they put out, then they get to continue their takeover, and then they get to have their way with all of us.
[01:28:26.706 --> 01:28:34.072]  The safest thing you can do, if you're going public and being prominent, is use your real name and be out front and trust in God.
[01:28:35.773 --> 01:28:37.474]  Not creep around.
[01:28:38.035 --> 01:28:41.017]  I've found when you do that, that brings the wolves fast.
[01:28:43.596 --> 01:28:46.579]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.519 --> 01:28:50.202]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:57.159]  Hey, Dad, we need your help finishing the Christmas tree.
[01:28:57.339 --> 01:28:57.980]  Okay, boys.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.341]  I just got a few more Uncivil Liberties DVDs to ship out today.
[01:29:01.501 --> 01:29:03.282]  Why do you guys make Uncivil Liberties?
[01:29:03.362 --> 01:29:06.484]  You know how we like to look at those cool illustrations on Rents.com?
[01:29:06.524 --> 01:29:07.965]  Yeah, David Dees rocks.
[01:29:08.145 --> 01:29:09.325]  I like the chips one.
[01:29:09.465 --> 01:29:11.006]  Well, those aren't chocolate chips.
[01:29:11.306 --> 01:29:15.969]  Those are little tracking devices the government wants to put under our skin someday to track us.
[01:29:16.129 --> 01:29:18.290]  You mean the government's not the good guys?
[01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:19.791]  Well, they should be the good guys.
[01:29:19.871 --> 01:29:22.474]  They're supposed to do what we the people say they should do.
[01:29:22.654 --> 01:29:27.159]  But these days, the people are too busy watching their favorite TV shows to keep an eye on the government.
[01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:28.660]  You mean like SpongeBob?
[01:29:28.961 --> 01:29:29.781]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:29:30.142 --> 01:29:35.587]  So we made on civil liberties to help remind everyone to keep an eye on what's happening, not to fall asleep.
[01:29:35.807 --> 01:29:36.308]  Asleep?
[01:29:36.708 --> 01:29:38.170]  It's not even bedtime yet.
[01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:39.311]  Exactly.
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.944]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[01:30:23.234 --> 01:30:23.514]  I think so.
[01:30:53.596 --> 01:30:54.076]  Hi, Ken.
[01:30:54.136 --> 01:30:54.896]  It's Judy again.
[01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:59.437]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:30:59.597 --> 01:31:02.738]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:04.838]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:31:05.118 --> 01:31:07.199]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:13.480]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:18.981]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:31:19.241 --> 01:31:22.102]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:31:22.222 --> 01:31:23.142]  Go KenSolar!
[01:31:24.443 --> 01:31:25.964]  Get the best of both worlds.

[01:32:14.034 --> 01:32:15.455]  Central Standard Time.
[01:32:15.515 --> 01:32:16.516]  We're here live.

[01:32:57.135 --> 01:32:59.237]  I'm going to blast through five of your calls right now.
[01:33:01.398 --> 01:33:04.781]  By blast, you know, I'm talking tortoise speed.
[01:33:05.481 --> 01:33:06.242]  One inch per hour.
[01:33:06.262 --> 01:33:06.963]  I'm joking.
[01:33:06.983 --> 01:33:14.769]  We're going to try to go through your calls quick right now because I've got some clips I want to play and a bunch of news that I have not yet gotten into in full.
[01:33:15.904 --> 01:33:18.386]  Right now, let's talk to Dave in New York.
[01:33:18.446 --> 01:33:19.366]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:33:19.386 --> 01:33:21.087]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:33:21.427 --> 01:33:25.730]  The quip to get on the Mike Huckabee thing is from Morning Joe this morning.
[01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:34.534]  I woke up this morning to them, and it was complete coordination, and it's like all three of them had bad poker faces.
[01:33:34.795 --> 01:33:39.257]  Morning Joe is that pornographic morning program they have on Fox.
[01:33:39.877 --> 01:33:42.479]  No, no, Morning Joe is Joe Scarborough on MSNBC.
[01:33:42.859 --> 01:33:43.399]  Oh, that's right.
[01:33:43.439 --> 01:33:44.060]  And Mika Brzezinski.
[01:33:45.498 --> 01:33:48.682]  So, you know, she can see what they're doing.
[01:33:49.243 --> 01:33:50.144]  Remember, I'm out of it.
[01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:51.425]  I've got a cold right now.
[01:33:51.586 --> 01:33:51.966]  Me too.
[01:33:52.807 --> 01:33:53.988]  Okay, morning Joe.
[01:33:54.169 --> 01:33:55.090]  And what was he saying?
[01:33:55.854 --> 01:34:04.015]  So basically, this is a day after Ron Paul was on Fox & Friends, and he warned about fascism in America with the cross and the flag, the Sinclair Lewis quote?
[01:34:04.175 --> 01:34:05.256]  Yes, we have that clip.
[01:34:05.496 --> 01:34:11.977]  Yeah, so they're all saying, they're all saying that this is in response to Mitt Romney attacking them, which is garbage.
[01:34:12.497 --> 01:34:16.338]  Because it's definitely because of what Ron Paul said on Fox & Friends.
[01:34:16.978 --> 01:34:20.378]  So basically, how they set it up, this is like right when the show started.
[01:34:20.438 --> 01:34:24.399]  Huckabee's coming on, they're all excited, or at least Joe is excited, and Willie Geist said,
[01:34:25.123 --> 01:34:27.965]  Whatever he is, is pretending to be excited too.
[01:34:29.005 --> 01:34:39.452]  And so, they said that Mike Huckabee was praying that somebody would attack him over his ad.
[01:34:40.152 --> 01:34:42.954]  And he was having like a press conference doing this.
[01:34:43.374 --> 01:34:46.696]  And then he said that the cross behind him was not planned, it was a bookshelf.
[01:34:47.176 --> 01:34:52.659]  And anybody who thinks otherwise, that it was planned, is a conspiracy nut or whatever.
[01:34:54.384 --> 01:35:07.653]  That if you play the ad backwards, it says, Paul is dead, Paul is dead, and you're a filmmaker, you know, obviously, any ad you would do, anything in the background with a one shot of somebody's head, you obviously know it's in the background.
[01:35:07.693 --> 01:35:08.634]  That's not even really it.
[01:35:08.954 --> 01:35:16.039]  Yeah, A, Huckabee's a liar, B, it's just a big distraction to bring attention on Huckabee as a controversy, it's all staged.
[01:35:16.439 --> 01:35:17.480]  Yeah, yeah, it's all staged.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.942]  But pretty much that's all I wanted to say.
[01:35:19.962 --> 01:35:23.344]  I was trying to call earlier, but you guys pretty much covered it all, but that's the clip to get.
[01:35:23.795 --> 01:35:24.316]  Thank you, Dave.
[01:35:24.416 --> 01:35:25.056]  I appreciate it.
[01:35:25.937 --> 01:35:27.778]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chuck in Texas.
[01:35:27.859 --> 01:35:28.679]  Chuck, you're on the air.
[01:35:28.699 --> 01:35:30.040]  Hi, Alex.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.201]  Hadn't talked to you in a while.
[01:35:32.062 --> 01:35:40.429]  The reason for my call today is I had heard that Huckabee's going to be down here in San Antonio at Hagee's church.
[01:35:40.469 --> 01:35:41.410]  You know John Hagee?
[01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:48.056]  Oh, John Hagee, that says Jesus is not the Messiah and that killing Palestinian children is of the Lord.
[01:35:48.076 --> 01:35:51.378]  The little portly, little demon creature.
[01:35:51.418 --> 01:35:51.819]  You mean him?
[01:35:52.443 --> 01:35:53.704]  Yeah, that's the one.
[01:35:53.984 --> 01:35:57.406]  And he's going to be there this Sunday at 8.30 and 11.
[01:35:58.227 --> 01:36:10.395]  I hope nobody would have any outbursts or anything in his services because it would be playing right into the hands of these people.
[01:36:11.056 --> 01:36:14.858]  But over there at Crossroads, I just heard that.
[01:36:16.283 --> 01:36:22.248]  You know, basically, you know, with Hagee's new book, he's taking pages out of the Bible and just shredding them.
[01:36:22.668 --> 01:36:26.731]  In defense of Israel, Jesus did not come as the Messiah.
[01:36:26.992 --> 01:36:30.675]  He came as a rebel force that had to be dealt with.
[01:36:31.667 --> 01:36:35.830]  I mean, that guy is just, and then they go, oh yes, Jesus is the devil!
[01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:37.571]  Hail Satan!
[01:36:38.012 --> 01:36:52.362]  I mean, these people are literally, and then those church goers are just, New come, new come of the Lord, oh great nuclear missile, we praise thee, oh great power, incinerate the dirty Arab!
[01:36:52.382 --> 01:36:58.446]  Well, you know, he's also had people there like Oliver North, and such.
[01:36:58.726 --> 01:37:00.027]  Oh, it's a total blackout.
[01:37:00.552 --> 01:37:11.642]  Anyways, you have a good Christmas holidays and I'm still for Ron Paul and I understand sometimes he makes mistakes.
[01:37:12.342 --> 01:37:16.326]  It's especially hard because only your mistakes are going to make it on the air.
[01:37:16.346 --> 01:37:18.768]  Chuck, it's good to hear from you.
[01:37:18.868 --> 01:37:19.408]  Anything else?
[01:37:25.077 --> 01:37:30.739]  Oh, if you want a good laugh, go check out Red State Update with Jackie Rose and Dunlap.
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:32.620]  These guys crack me up.
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:34.741]  Good to hear from you, Chuck.
[01:37:35.341 --> 01:37:36.501]  Chuck hasn't called in years.
[01:37:36.542 --> 01:37:37.182]  Good to hear from him.
[01:37:37.202 --> 01:37:38.142]  I recognize his voice.
[01:37:39.123 --> 01:37:43.304]  Let's talk to Dan in Georgia.
[01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:44.184]  You're on the air, Dan.
[01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:45.665]  Hey, Alex.
[01:37:45.705 --> 01:37:46.725]  Good to talk to you again.
[01:37:46.745 --> 01:37:50.667]  I did want to ask you about the live polls at the Pentagon.
[01:37:50.687 --> 01:37:52.988]  I totally believe, you know,
[01:37:53.581 --> 01:37:56.462]  I'll tell you what, and thanks for the call, let me answer both those questions.
[01:37:56.482 --> 01:37:57.783]  Why don't we take the second question first.
[01:37:57.803 --> 01:37:59.023]  Will you queue up Hager's defense of Israel?
[01:38:22.521 --> 01:38:26.745]  Jesus did not come to be the Messiah, and he was not that Messiah.
[01:38:28.927 --> 01:38:32.550]  Therefore, the Jews should not reject him as the Messiah.
[01:38:32.871 --> 01:38:39.136]  This Calgary conspiracy was meant to demonize the wonderful people.
[01:38:40.437 --> 01:38:41.298]  Can you find that, John?
[01:38:43.901 --> 01:38:46.283]  I know you're scrolling through thousands of clips you have.
[01:38:46.303 --> 01:38:47.163]  It was a couple months ago.
[01:38:47.844 --> 01:38:48.625]  Pastor Hagee.
[01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:52.472]  Just chime in my ear if you're even looking.
[01:38:52.492 --> 01:38:52.872]  Do you hear me?
[01:38:53.833 --> 01:38:54.533]  Okay, you're looking good.
[01:38:55.254 --> 01:38:57.356]  Okay, then I'll answer the first question while he's finding that.
[01:38:57.376 --> 01:39:01.779]  Let me just try to answer this as best I can.
[01:39:03.561 --> 01:39:05.582]  None of my films cover the Pentagon.
[01:39:06.243 --> 01:39:08.505]  Now, I did executive produce because they asked for the help.
[01:39:10.206 --> 01:39:13.789]  Loose change final cut, and it does have some questions about the Pentagon.
[01:39:14.269 --> 01:39:17.552]  And that's gotten the most media attention, so if you cover it, it gets a lot of attention.
[01:39:18.233 --> 01:39:19.834]  The media is more than happy to cover that.
[01:39:21.426 --> 01:39:23.327]  And the 16 foot hole is weird.
[01:39:23.847 --> 01:39:25.408]  Little or no wreckage is weird.
[01:39:27.449 --> 01:39:32.151]  The stand down is bizarre of Chaney as the plane came in or whatever came in.
[01:39:33.372 --> 01:39:34.633]  All of it is very suspicious.
[01:39:34.653 --> 01:39:43.757]  How they grabbed all the surveillance camera tapes from the gas stations and the shopping centers and the hotel.
[01:39:44.458 --> 01:39:45.278]  All the things they did.
[01:39:45.938 --> 01:39:46.899]  Very suspicious.
[01:39:47.519 --> 01:39:49.260]  And they released these videos that show nothing.
[01:39:50.365 --> 01:39:53.566]  But someday they could bring out either a manufactured or a real video of the plane.
[01:39:54.246 --> 01:40:03.169]  Now that Honey Honjure could, you know, do this with a plane, we've interviewed a bunch of fighter pilots and commercial pilots and they've said it's impossible here on air.
[01:40:04.349 --> 01:40:05.630]  So there's something wrong with that.
[01:40:06.170 --> 01:40:19.274]  But notice the media, when Popular Mechanics is here, History Channel's here, or any of this national media that comes through every month or so, every time they're here, they always want to talk about the Pentagon.
[01:40:20.313 --> 01:40:22.995]  They never want to talk about the hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:40:23.035 --> 01:40:25.516]  military bases, or the heads of the U.S.
[01:40:25.576 --> 01:40:28.258]  embassies saying they were ordered to let them back in and were told they were U.S.
[01:40:28.298 --> 01:40:35.182]  government agents, or the CIA drills of hijacking jets and flying them to the World Trade Center and Pentagon at the exact same time it was happening.
[01:40:35.702 --> 01:40:37.123]  All of that is mainstream news.
[01:40:39.088 --> 01:40:42.211]  The fact that 18,000 British, 44,000 U.S.
[01:40:42.611 --> 01:40:51.919]  troops were massed in the countries in and around Afghanistan, that the aircraft carriers were lined up, that Bush had the launch order to attack Afghanistan on his desk two days before and signed it.
[01:40:51.939 --> 01:40:54.521]  I mean, this was all finely tuned.
[01:40:54.821 --> 01:40:58.444]  Didn't any of you ask if they were already bombing and invading Afghanistan two weeks after?
[01:40:58.464 --> 01:41:02.447]  It took them six months to build up.
[01:41:04.649 --> 01:41:06.290]  And see, you look at those areas of 9-11,
[01:41:07.751 --> 01:41:14.576]  And you bring those up to a Bill Christian Center or a Robert Baer or the President of Italy, and they'll tell you, yeah, that's an inside job.
[01:41:15.096 --> 01:41:16.277]  And there's hundreds of those.
[01:41:17.758 --> 01:41:21.561]  And so, yeah, some light poles got knocked down and some other things happened.
[01:41:24.223 --> 01:41:25.543]  They can say, well, an airplane did that.
[01:41:25.804 --> 01:41:26.464]  Look, I don't know.
[01:41:26.944 --> 01:41:28.926]  I don't know anything about that.
[01:41:29.646 --> 01:41:30.767]  It's just a big honeypot.
[01:41:30.807 --> 01:41:31.968]  People love a mystery.
[01:41:31.988 --> 01:41:36.131]  You can debate it all day in different angles and different witnesses and the rest of it.
[01:41:36.778 --> 01:41:40.319]  I just know there are thousands of points that show me this is a black op.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:50.162]  And with any black op, you've got all these smokescreens, and double patsies, and drills, and all these rabbit trails to follow.
[01:41:50.603 --> 01:41:58.165]  That's what they do in one of these ops, so you can never get to the exact truth, because even most of the people involved in the operation don't have the full picture.
[01:42:00.737 --> 01:42:01.618]  That's why it was Kennedy.
[01:42:01.658 --> 01:42:09.006]  They had Cuban right-wingers, they had mobster hitmen, they had Texas hired-out hitmen, they had old CIA guys running them.
[01:42:12.130 --> 01:42:22.041]  And we had always broken down exactly how they did it and how they created all these different layers and how the military was involved at support level, how the phone lines went dead at the Pentagon, how
[01:42:23.673 --> 01:42:33.042]  Within 30 minutes of Kennedy being shot, the foreign news in New Zealand and everywhere else already had, in Japan, already had it was Lee Harvey Oswald, hours before he was even captured.
[01:42:35.444 --> 01:42:42.750]  Just like BBC reporting Building 7 fell 25 minutes before it did, and giving the exact official story of how it fell and how it eventually did fall.
[01:42:43.931 --> 01:42:44.792]  Red-handed, folks.
[01:42:45.913 --> 01:42:46.454]  Red-handed.
[01:42:47.355 --> 01:42:48.315]  They do make mistakes.
[01:42:48.916 --> 01:42:49.717]  And now we have the
[01:42:51.463 --> 01:42:52.263]  Guy who we always knew.
[01:42:52.283 --> 01:42:53.804]  We always said E. Howard Hunt ran the op.
[01:42:54.224 --> 01:42:54.904]  He was photographed.
[01:42:54.924 --> 01:42:55.464]  He was arrested.
[01:42:55.484 --> 01:42:56.284]  He was ordered released.
[01:42:56.984 --> 01:42:58.805]  George Herbert Walker Bush was in the background.
[01:42:59.325 --> 01:43:00.405]  Photographed repeatedly.
[01:43:00.485 --> 01:43:00.865]  It's him.
[01:43:00.905 --> 01:43:01.925]  It's George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:43:03.426 --> 01:43:04.026]  They're all there.
[01:43:05.006 --> 01:43:06.186]  LBJ's on the radio.
[01:43:07.006 --> 01:43:07.886]  Running the whole op.
[01:43:08.107 --> 01:43:09.907]  He was a control freak from behind the cars.
[01:43:10.907 --> 01:43:15.328]  Secret Service was ordered to stand down and get out of the way and get off the cars and through fits.
[01:43:18.049 --> 01:43:19.789]  But now we have the head guy saying he did it.
[01:43:20.498 --> 01:43:20.658]  Yeah.
[01:43:20.958 --> 01:43:21.339]  End of story.
[01:43:21.379 --> 01:43:24.401]  But you're not going to hear that on the news.
[01:43:24.421 --> 01:43:27.003]  I mean, you might see it on Rolling Stone or something, but that's about it.
[01:43:27.043 --> 01:43:29.165]  It should have been massive global news.
[01:43:31.346 --> 01:43:32.167]  Holy mackerel.
[01:43:32.207 --> 01:43:35.109]  Let's go ahead and... Holy mackerel, I feel like.
[01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:38.351]  Roadkill or something.
[01:43:38.792 --> 01:43:41.073]  I should have taken off today, but I'm taking off part of next week.
[01:43:41.794 --> 01:43:43.175]  So I thought, you know, I'm not going to do this.
[01:43:43.195 --> 01:43:45.176]  I hope people are bearing with me here on the show.
[01:43:45.216 --> 01:43:46.297]  I'm a little bit dingy.
[01:43:46.598 --> 01:43:48.279]  Oh yeah, his other question about Hagee.
[01:43:48.759 --> 01:43:49.780]  Here is Hagee right here.
[01:43:51.428 --> 01:43:54.511]  I'm delighted to present my latest book, In Defense of Israel.
[01:43:55.031 --> 01:43:59.295]  This book will expose the sins of the fathers and the vicious abuse of the Jewish people.
[01:43:59.895 --> 01:44:02.698]  In Defense of Israel will shape Christian theology.
[01:44:03.438 --> 01:44:08.202]  It scripturally proves that the Jewish people as a whole did not reject Jesus as Messiah.
[01:44:08.763 --> 01:44:12.306]  It will also prove that Jesus did not come to earth to be the Messiah.
[01:44:13.035 --> 01:44:21.797]  It will prove that there was a Calvary conspiracy between Rome, the high priest, and Herod to execute Jesus as an insurrectionist too dangerous to live.
[01:44:22.418 --> 01:44:29.900]  Since Jesus refused by word and deed to claim to be the Messiah, how can the Jews be blamed for rejecting what was never offered?
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:33.781]  Read it in this shocking expose in defense of Israel.
[01:44:34.341 --> 01:44:38.962]  This latest book by Pastor John Hagee is destined to generate lively discussion among Christians.
[01:44:39.708 --> 01:44:47.771]  And since then, I've found other clips of him saying he praises God every time a Palestinian child is killed, and how nuking them is of the Lord.
[01:44:47.791 --> 01:44:57.954]  And then he went to AIPAC, the biggest American-Israeli lobbying arm, and you ought to go watch his speech from that.
[01:44:58.674 --> 01:45:01.595]  He says basically, America's evil, Christians are evil.
[01:45:02.855 --> 01:45:04.676]  He openly begins worshipping Israel.
[01:45:05.956 --> 01:45:07.937]  It's the most bizarre stuff I've ever seen in my life.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:11.781]  And it's just frothing around.
[01:45:13.782 --> 01:45:14.342]  It's crazy.
[01:45:15.523 --> 01:45:16.083]  It's crazy.
[01:45:17.004 --> 01:45:19.965]  But I mean, you've got Pat Robertson endorsing Giuliani now.
[01:45:20.725 --> 01:45:23.026]  Pro-open border, anti-gun, pro-abortion.
[01:45:24.687 --> 01:45:25.367]  They don't care.
[01:45:26.228 --> 01:45:28.249]  They know Christians today will do anything.
[01:45:28.269 --> 01:45:30.530]  They don't care about babies, that is the mainline ones.
[01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:32.270]  They don't care about borders.
[01:45:33.111 --> 01:45:38.213]  As long as you say you want to kill Islamo-fascists, that the mainline Christians can't find on a map,
[01:45:40.114 --> 01:45:40.514]  It's over.
[01:45:40.775 --> 01:45:45.058]  Thinking goes out the window and they're ready to accept abortion, anything.
[01:45:45.098 --> 01:45:45.939]  They just don't care.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.281]  Now let me tell you, who's killed more?
[01:45:48.581 --> 01:45:52.784]  Al-Qaeda, if you believe the official Al-Qaeda story, or abortion?
[01:45:54.326 --> 01:45:57.828]  Just a thought, but I know it's not as scary as a guy in a turban.
[01:45:58.529 --> 01:45:59.610]  It's not as much fun.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:10.346]  Sit around and whisper in many about the Islamo boogeymen with big fangs and green glowing eyes, ghouls that sneak around in the pumpkin patch at night.
[01:46:12.427 --> 01:46:13.507]  I'm so sick of it.
[01:46:14.328 --> 01:46:21.972]  That doe-eyed, chicken-necked, fake Huckabee who knows he's running an operation right now to get Hillary into office.
[01:46:22.192 --> 01:46:22.873]  They're shilling.
[01:46:22.913 --> 01:46:23.673]  It makes me sick.
[01:46:26.054 --> 01:46:27.115]  Who's up next here?
[01:46:28.234 --> 01:46:30.675]  Todd in North Carolina, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:46:33.256 --> 01:46:34.016]  Are you there, Alex?
[01:46:34.357 --> 01:46:35.057]  I sure am!
[01:46:35.077 --> 01:46:36.738]  Okay, sorry about that.
[01:46:36.838 --> 01:46:38.398]  That's okay, go ahead, sir.
[01:46:38.858 --> 01:46:41.399]  Okay, I've got a couple of questions for you.
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:46.642]  The way I found out about you, I'm in North Carolina.
[01:46:47.162 --> 01:46:49.783]  I heard you on the Alan Handelman Show recently.
[01:46:50.507 --> 01:46:52.848]  And that was a really good interview.
[01:46:53.128 --> 01:46:57.970]  Yeah, did you know when the White House guy called in and said that they weren't helping Hillary and then I pulled up the articles?
[01:46:58.830 --> 01:46:59.171]  Oh, yeah.
[01:46:59.471 --> 01:46:59.731]  Yeah.
[01:46:59.831 --> 01:47:05.113]  I mean, that's the thing I appreciate about you is you've got your sources.
[01:47:05.393 --> 01:47:09.535]  I mean, every time somebody has a question about something, everything's documented.
[01:47:09.615 --> 01:47:14.477]  So, you know, I mean, all your arguments hold water.
[01:47:14.577 --> 01:47:16.598]  So, anyhow,
[01:47:17.608 --> 01:47:23.252]  Probably about six months ago is when I initially started listening to you, but I listen to Alan Handelman here locally.
[01:47:24.413 --> 01:47:29.797]  But the way I found out about you is I was doing some research on a fellow by the name of John Todd.
[01:47:30.037 --> 01:47:31.038]  Are you familiar with him?
[01:47:32.419 --> 01:47:34.600]  It rings some vague bell.
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:35.061]  Who is it?
[01:47:36.081 --> 01:47:44.547]  Okay, this guy, he was, I guess, kind of infamous back in the 70s, talking about the Illuminati.
[01:47:45.268 --> 01:47:46.669]  He said that he was a former
[01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:54.554]  I guess, upper tier, Mason, involved in the occult and everything, and somehow he got out of that.
[01:47:55.414 --> 01:47:59.536]  I guess, when he got in the upper levels, he... You know, there's a lot of the guys that claim that.
[01:47:59.556 --> 01:48:06.620]  I got some are real, some aren't, from my experience, but no, I don't... I think I've heard that name, but just bring it up, your question.
[01:48:07.341 --> 01:48:15.585]  Well, anyhow, my question was if you knew if this guy was legitimate or not, because back in the 70s, he was talking about a lot of the same stuff that you talked about.
[01:48:16.269 --> 01:48:20.870]  And, you know, that was back before the Internet and mass communication like we have it today.
[01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:25.511]  And, you know, then he ended up in insane asylum.
[01:48:25.651 --> 01:48:29.692]  And, you know, the possibility is there was some smear campaigned on.
[01:48:29.992 --> 01:48:37.733]  Oh, well, there have been tens of thousands of Americans, you know, Pulitzer Prize winners, people like Ezra Pound, who you don't have to agree with.
[01:48:38.213 --> 01:48:39.854]  But the point is, he wasn't crazy.
[01:48:40.394 --> 01:48:45.855]  And because he was against the Federal Reserve and said it was private, they locked him up, I think, for 10 years in the loony bin.
[01:48:46.618 --> 01:49:03.151]  Yeah, well this guy, John Todd, he talked about the Illuminati, the Bilderbergers, and he talked about how the Illuminati wanted to bankrupt all of our corporations across the country and everything, and basically, you know, be able to buy them up cheaply because of that.
[01:49:03.531 --> 01:49:13.118]  And he did mention Ayn Rand's book, Atlas Shrugged, and said that that was kind of a game plan for the Illuminati.
[01:49:13.198 --> 01:49:13.799]  I mean, do you have
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:17.501]  I hear you mention Ayn Rand every now and again.
[01:49:17.521 --> 01:49:22.264]  Do you know of any kind of inside message to that book?
[01:49:23.604 --> 01:49:28.927]  I don't particularly believe in her total philosophy, but no, I'm not aware of that.
[01:49:29.227 --> 01:49:30.187]  I'll have to look into it.
[01:49:32.369 --> 01:49:33.249]  Anything else, my friend?
[01:49:33.269 --> 01:49:34.430]  That's it.
[01:49:34.450 --> 01:49:35.810]  God bless you and I hope you feel better.
[01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:36.410]  Thank you.
[01:49:36.731 --> 01:49:37.171]  Thank you.
[01:49:37.191 --> 01:49:43.634]  The only reason I'm mentioning that I'm sick is so people tune in and understand that that's why I sound different right now.
[01:49:44.395 --> 01:49:45.355]  I'm a little bit dull.
[01:49:45.375 --> 01:49:48.316]  All right, we'll be back with more calls, more news.
[01:49:48.376 --> 01:49:53.157]  Stay with me.
[01:49:54.098 --> 01:49:55.498]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:55.518 --> 01:49:57.618]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.339 --> 01:50:02.760]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:06.021]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:06.041 --> 01:50:08.321]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:50:08.841 --> 01:50:11.242]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.017 --> 01:50:19.350]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.367 --> 01:50:27.350]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:31.273]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.673 --> 01:50:34.195]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:34.255 --> 01:50:35.215]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.235 --> 01:50:36.196]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.216 --> 01:50:37.276]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.477 --> 01:50:38.217]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.437 --> 01:50:39.578]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[01:50:39.598 --> 01:50:44.161]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:50:44.361 --> 01:50:47.803]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:48.303 --> 01:50:50.685]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:51.125 --> 01:50:52.305]  You have been warned.
[01:50:53.286 --> 01:50:58.507]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.647 --> 01:51:06.750]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:14.032]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.232 --> 01:51:15.153]  We're good to go!
[01:51:41.411 --> 01:51:41.671]  We're good.
[01:51:53.055 --> 01:51:56.376]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:51:56.716 --> 01:52:03.617]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:52:03.997 --> 01:52:16.479]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:52:16.719 --> 01:52:19.360]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:25.904]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:52:26.144 --> 01:52:31.288]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:52:31.528 --> 01:52:39.793]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:52:39.993 --> 01:52:40.633]  And the best part?
[01:52:40.874 --> 01:52:42.875]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:52:43.115 --> 01:52:45.698]  Simply go to 321release.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:53:28.938 --> 01:53:30.239]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:30.259 --> 01:53:33.540]  We found the actual Huckabee clip where he's talking about Paul is dead.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:34.680]  Paul is dead.
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:35.521]  Paul is dead.
[01:53:35.561 --> 01:53:35.941]  Here it is.
[01:53:38.314 --> 01:53:43.562]  This idea that there was a subliminal message, the floating cross, it is a bookshelf, people.
[01:53:43.582 --> 01:53:45.044]  I don't know about that, Governor.
[01:53:45.304 --> 01:53:46.486]  I'm at the property.
[01:53:46.526 --> 01:53:47.728]  Wait, hold on a second.
[01:53:47.788 --> 01:53:49.670]  Okay, Governor, I'm with you.
[01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:53.436]  I'm with you, Governor, but our remarks is Mika Brzezinski disagrees.
[01:53:53.456 --> 01:53:54.016]  Go ahead, Governor.
[01:53:54.677 --> 01:54:04.146]  Mika, I gotta tell you, actually what you didn't catch was with my eyes, I was signaling in Morse code a very secret message to all the evangelicals out there.
[01:54:04.166 --> 01:54:07.168]  And you have to watch very carefully to catch that.
[01:54:07.208 --> 01:54:11.612]  I told some reporters yesterday that if you play the spot backwards, it says, Paul is dead.
[01:54:11.753 --> 01:54:12.593]  Paul is dead.
[01:54:12.633 --> 01:54:13.334]  Paul is dead.
[01:54:13.394 --> 01:54:15.696]  Well, I have to tell you, Governor, I felt blessed.
[01:54:17.698 --> 01:54:19.099]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:20.899 --> 01:54:24.681]  That individual is just a real piece of work, isn't he?
[01:54:26.663 --> 01:54:29.184]  And he knew exactly what he meant by that.
[01:54:29.204 --> 01:54:30.605]  That was all scripted out.
[01:54:30.645 --> 01:54:31.866]  That's pointed right at Ron Paul.
[01:54:31.926 --> 01:54:37.830]  CNN knows that, because hours later, they play it underneath Ron Paul.
[01:54:39.070 --> 01:54:45.635]  Hours later, they come out, and they run that underneath Ron Paul.
[01:54:46.175 --> 01:54:49.377]  Huckabee says, Paul is dead, Paul is dead, Paul is dead.
[01:54:51.573 --> 01:54:52.674]  And they love subliminals.
[01:54:52.694 --> 01:54:54.155]  We were just talking about subliminals yesterday.
[01:54:54.535 --> 01:54:58.398]  By the way, that bookshelf, and again, this is meant for Christians to go, well, what's wrong with the cross?
[01:54:58.538 --> 01:54:58.838]  Nothing!
[01:54:59.619 --> 01:55:02.681]  Bush goes and poses behind crosses all the time for photographs.
[01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:06.323]  They also do shots of him with big circular lights behind him where it looks like a halo.
[01:55:06.803 --> 01:55:07.804]  You've seen those everywhere.
[01:55:09.365 --> 01:55:10.646]  All these politicians do that.
[01:55:12.427 --> 01:55:14.849]  They think about what they're doing, and they think about what they put behind them.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:19.861]  So they know what they're up to.
[01:55:19.921 --> 01:55:31.330]  But the big news of the day is that Ron Paul was questioned by AOL so that he's not completely ruling out running on another party's ticket if he loses the Republican nomination.
[01:55:34.893 --> 01:55:35.874]  And that is huge news.
[01:55:36.675 --> 01:55:42.319]  And so when we start the next hour, I will continue with some of your calls and to get your take on that particular.
[01:55:42.339 --> 01:55:44.281]  I mean, should he run as a Libertarian?
[01:55:44.301 --> 01:55:45.702]  Should he run as a Constitutional Party?
[01:55:46.578 --> 01:55:46.678]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:46.698 --> 01:55:46.758]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:46.778 --> 01:55:48.018]  Another big report out today.
[01:55:48.038 --> 01:55:50.619]  Rockefeller's joked about controlling the world.
[01:55:50.639 --> 01:55:54.240]  Elitist sons would carve up the planet into different fiefdoms.
[01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:57.441]  Something really behind the joke, admits the biographer.
[01:56:10.737 --> 01:56:19.722]  The elitist Rockefeller sons sometimes joked about which parts of the world they would each control according to the biographer Peter Collier, carving up the world into different fiefdoms.
[01:56:20.262 --> 01:56:28.527]  Collier's admission that there was something really behind the joke is an understatement considering the revelations of the late Aaron Russo about what Nicholas Rockefeller told him.
[01:56:29.107 --> 01:56:35.431]  The admission is taken from a segment of the History Channel documentary about the Rockefeller family, which hit YouTube yesterday.
[01:56:36.131 --> 01:56:37.692]  John, I forgot to give this to you.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:43.885]  So you just go to Prism Planet and hit CTRL-F and hit Rockefeller's, you'll find the link.
[01:56:44.645 --> 01:56:45.826]  I want to play that next hour.
[01:56:46.987 --> 01:56:52.612]  Sometimes they would joke, this is the text, this is me reading a quote of the video you're going to hear later.
[01:56:53.173 --> 01:56:54.534]  Sometimes they would joke about it.
[01:56:55.014 --> 01:57:04.062]  They would say, well, David gets Europe, Nelson gets to have Latin America, and you know, John Dee III gets Asia, and they would make some joke about what Winthrop got.
[01:57:04.603 --> 01:57:05.824]  You know which one
[01:57:06.576 --> 01:57:07.197]  We're good to go.
[01:57:35.205 --> 01:57:38.166]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:38.526 --> 01:57:49.071]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.051 --> 01:57:50.751]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.351 --> 01:57:52.472]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:54.293]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.893 --> 01:57:55.753]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.474 --> 01:57:57.394]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.034 --> 01:58:01.816]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.196 --> 01:58:04.577]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:06.271]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.351 --> 01:58:09.333]  We are now into the third and final hour.
[01:58:09.734 --> 01:58:15.838]  Hard to believe we're already into the third and final hour here today.
[01:58:15.919 --> 01:58:20.542]  Coming up, Rockefeller's joked about controlling the world
[01:58:34.225 --> 01:58:38.726]  And this from a History Channel piece by their authorized biographer.
[01:58:39.566 --> 01:58:40.506]  There's no joke about it.
[01:58:40.646 --> 01:58:52.829]  Every globalist organization, every eugenics organization, every time you get to the end of it, about 80% of the time it's a Rockefeller family, another 20% it's the Ford or Carnegie endowment.
[01:58:52.909 --> 01:58:56.710]  I mean, it's... And generally the Rockefellers are involved too.
[01:58:57.570 --> 01:59:01.751]  I mean, they literally have charted the course of our planet for the last hundred years.
[01:59:03.596 --> 01:59:10.419]  And David, in his biography, his autobiography, written by him, three years ago, says they're trying to set up a world government.
[01:59:11.399 --> 01:59:29.046]  But then we talk about it and tell the general public, who literally don't know their head from the hole in the ground, and they just say, none of that exists, there's no elites, there's no power, I run everything, there's nobody over me either, there's nobody trying to guide my life, I run everything.
[01:59:30.097 --> 01:59:42.089]  Of course, the so-called joke was a thin veil over the fact that they, by the end of the 1950s, had become a preeminent elitist family and controlled huge swaths of economies, infrastructure, media, and businesses worldwide.
[01:59:43.090 --> 01:59:53.060]  Revelations, on behalf of the late Aaron Russo, concerning that Nicholas Rockefeller told him about the family's predatory control of the planet, were explicit in their honesty and scale.
[01:59:53.797 --> 01:59:59.803]  Nick Rockefeller told Russo in advance that an event would precipitate the invasion of Afghanistan so that the U.S.
[01:59:59.823 --> 02:00:05.088]  could run oil pipelines through the country before invading Iraq and establishing military bases throughout the Middle East.
[02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:13.437]  He also stated that we would see soldiers looking into caves in Afghanistan and Pakistan for Osama Bin Laden, and that there would be endless war on terror
[02:00:14.682 --> 02:00:17.303]  When there's no real enemy and the whole thing is a giant hoax.
[02:00:17.823 --> 02:00:28.585]  So that the government could take over the American people, according to Rousseau, who said that Rockefeller was cynically laughing and joking as he made these astounding predictions 11 months before 9-11.
[02:00:29.546 --> 02:00:32.887]  Again, nearly a year before 9-11 took place.
[02:00:32.907 --> 02:00:42.849]  It goes on, Rockefeller also related how members of the elite were obsessed by creating a world identification society where people had to carry ID cards and prove who they were at all times.
[02:00:44.426 --> 02:00:50.871]  During one conversation, Rockefeller asked Rousseau if he was interested in joining the Council on Foreign Relations, CFR.
[02:00:51.232 --> 02:00:58.938]  But Rousseau rejected the invitation, saying he had no interest in enslaving the people, to which Rockefeller coldly questioned why he cared about the service.
[02:00:59.671 --> 02:01:03.153]  I used to say to him that, where's the point of all this, Senator?
[02:01:03.193 --> 02:01:07.035]  You have all the money in the world you need, you have all the power you need, what's the point?
[02:01:07.595 --> 02:01:08.556]  What's the end goal?
[02:01:08.576 --> 02:01:16.200]  To which Rockefeller replied, paraphrasing, the end goal is to get everybody chipped, to control the whole society, to have the bankers and the elite people control the world.
[02:01:16.937 --> 02:01:30.064]  Rockefeller also told Rousseau that his family foundation created and bankrolled, by the way this is mainstream news, the woman's liberation movement in order to destroy the family and the population reduction was the fundamental aim of the global elite.
[02:01:30.925 --> 02:01:36.388]  Below there you can watch a clip of Rousseau's interview with Alex Jones which he details the missions of Rockefeller.
[02:01:36.408 --> 02:01:41.531]  You can also watch a clip of the History Channel and that is coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:45.313 --> 02:01:48.194]  My good friend Kevin Booth here in studio.
[02:01:48.214 --> 02:02:10.022]  I also want to get into a story from yesterday I said I was going to cover, but that I never got to, and that's the little girl who brought a serrated butter knife, but they call that a butcher knife, a serrated devil weapon, to cut her steak with that her dad had cooked the night before.
[02:02:10.622 --> 02:02:12.143]  She's facing felony charges
[02:02:13.377 --> 02:02:24.422]  And I just wanted to dovetail this into a lot of other issues that we face and just go over the larger picture there.
[02:02:25.822 --> 02:02:28.823]  We'll also jam some of your phone calls in and take calls with Kevin's here.
[02:02:29.324 --> 02:02:37.007]  Kevin's having a screening of his American Drug War film tomorrow night and there's going to be a bunch of free tickets given out here on air.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:39.581]  So you'll want to take advantage of that.
[02:02:39.621 --> 02:02:43.164]  I'm told about 200 people from this LA screening showed up from this show.
[02:02:44.245 --> 02:02:45.326]  We'll see what happens in Austin.
[02:02:46.067 --> 02:02:47.468]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:47.488 --> 02:02:49.610]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.311 --> 02:02:54.554]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:55.195 --> 02:02:57.977]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[02:02:58.037 --> 02:03:00.299]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:03.222]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:11.332]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.332 --> 02:03:19.315]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:19.796 --> 02:03:23.258]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:23.658 --> 02:03:26.180]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:27.381]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.401 --> 02:03:28.121]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.141 --> 02:03:29.222]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.442 --> 02:03:30.183]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.443 --> 02:03:31.784]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:47.141]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:47.688 --> 02:04:50.990]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:04:51.390 --> 02:04:54.311]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:04:54.611 --> 02:05:00.975]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:05:01.055 --> 02:05:05.477]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:05:05.697 --> 02:05:10.059]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:05:10.219 --> 02:05:12.821]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:05:12.841 --> 02:05:15.582]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:05:16.082 --> 02:05:18.605]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:05:18.645 --> 02:05:22.908]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:05:22.968 --> 02:05:23.829]  Treasury bonds.
[02:05:24.089 --> 02:05:28.714]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:05:28.894 --> 02:05:30.535]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:30.555 --> 02:05:32.137]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:05:44.685 --> 02:05:49.706]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.086 --> 02:05:52.406]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.647 --> 02:06:05.789]  We see these type of reports all the time.
[02:06:05.809 --> 02:06:13.090]  Knife at lunch, it's ten year old girl arrested at school.
[02:06:14.978 --> 02:06:22.463]  The police, even though the school is saying, teachers saw her pull out the serrated butter knife, but they call that a steak knife.
[02:06:22.923 --> 02:06:24.864]  Most butter knives, as you know, have a serrated edge.
[02:06:26.145 --> 02:06:27.646]  And they saw her with it.
[02:06:29.227 --> 02:06:30.288]  And she was cutting the meat.
[02:06:30.468 --> 02:06:31.788]  They say she's a good student.
[02:06:32.449 --> 02:06:37.772]  And they came over and the school teachers, like good Nazi pigs, went and called the police.
[02:06:38.753 --> 02:06:40.574]  And she went to jail and is in jail.
[02:06:41.753 --> 02:06:45.015]  And when the police arrived, she was eating the steak her dad had cooked the night before.
[02:06:46.076 --> 02:06:47.537]  She did not use it inappropriately.
[02:06:47.557 --> 02:06:48.698]  She did not threaten anyone with it.
[02:06:48.758 --> 02:06:50.860]  She didn't pull it out and brandish it.
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:54.923]  Nothing of that nature, explained Marion County School spokesman Kevin Christian.
[02:06:55.383 --> 02:07:02.328]  So at least this school has normal people running it at the higher levels, but moron idiots at the lower levels.
[02:07:02.368 --> 02:07:03.529]  Now, let me just say something.
[02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:07.532]  My dad, by the time I was five, was a dentist.
[02:07:07.572 --> 02:07:08.733]  He'd gotten out of dental school.
[02:07:10.347 --> 02:07:17.713]  And when I was in kindergarten, I remember sticking in my pocket a scraper, a tartar scraper.
[02:07:17.733 --> 02:07:19.234]  But you could call it a weapon.
[02:07:19.314 --> 02:07:20.415]  It's got a little curved end on it.
[02:07:20.955 --> 02:07:23.337]  I remember sticking it in my pocket because I wanted to show my friends.
[02:07:23.377 --> 02:07:24.118]  I didn't even hide it.
[02:07:24.818 --> 02:07:27.420]  I just stuck it in my pocket, kind of like when I was four years old.
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:33.805]  I picked up some candy, and my mother didn't notice that I had it until we were in the car, and she told me that was stealing, and I brought it back.
[02:07:34.566 --> 02:07:36.948]  But I had that in my pocket.
[02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:42.003]  And the teachers saw me out, show it to friends, and said, that's dangerous, and gave it back to my parents.
[02:07:42.663 --> 02:07:45.225]  Nowadays, they charge five-year-olds with felonies.
[02:07:46.286 --> 02:07:48.447]  And they call anything and everything a weapon.
[02:07:49.488 --> 02:07:51.049]  And that's what they're doing here.
[02:07:51.149 --> 02:07:58.754]  And so, your child wrestles on a playground in the third grade, and they knock somebody over, and a teacher sees it, felony charges.
[02:07:59.475 --> 02:08:01.856]  I mean, I want all these cops to think about all the things they did.
[02:08:01.896 --> 02:08:03.077]  What did you do in school?
[02:08:03.938 --> 02:08:05.579]  Did you ever take a pocket knife to class?
[02:08:06.246 --> 02:08:25.071]  In fact, when we went to school, and this was only, I don't know, I guess I was in high school 10, 13, 16 years ago, we pretty much, all of us, carried pocketknives and we'd pull them out and pick our fingernails at the desk and we'd have coaches chewing tobacco at the front.
[02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:31.832]  These were 5A schools too, but it wasn't yet the total Nazi Germany situation.
[02:08:35.228 --> 02:08:39.151]  I mean, they wanted gangbangers who were bringing knives to stab people to get in trouble.
[02:08:39.171 --> 02:08:41.712]  And if you did something like that, you'd get in trouble with some little pocketknife.
[02:08:42.293 --> 02:08:43.654]  Now, folks, they'll arrest you.
[02:08:44.734 --> 02:08:49.077]  You know, if you're in a mall store with a pocketknife, calling it an Al-Qaeda devil weapon.
[02:08:50.118 --> 02:08:53.220]  But this is the zero-tolerance culture.
[02:08:53.260 --> 02:09:01.666]  And in tyrannical cultures, we see systems where the entire apparatus of the police mechanism is focused in on the commoner.
[02:09:02.176 --> 02:09:10.902]  On the average person, the laws and the enforcement of them are ratcheted up to a point where things that weren't illegal are now illegal.
[02:09:13.064 --> 02:09:20.009]  There's a lot of you listening out there that send your children to government training camps, and I gotta tell you, I mean, kids do things they're not supposed to.
[02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:23.811]  But I remember the cases, there have been a couple of them.
[02:09:24.512 --> 02:09:27.294]  One girl was valedictorian, it was the last day of school.
[02:09:28.174 --> 02:09:29.595]  She brought a box of
[02:09:31.898 --> 02:09:33.879]  Dixie Knives, Forks, and Spoons.
[02:09:33.919 --> 02:09:34.679]  They are serrated.
[02:09:34.699 --> 02:09:36.740]  You can actually cut somebody with one of those.
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:41.961]  And, uh, she was going in to have a party for her favorite teacher with a few of her friends.
[02:09:41.981 --> 02:09:43.082]  This is the teacher's pet.
[02:09:43.842 --> 02:09:46.283]  Security guard stops her in the hall and says, what is that?
[02:09:46.323 --> 02:09:47.003]  She says, a cake.
[02:09:47.043 --> 02:09:47.723]  What's in the bag?
[02:09:48.263 --> 02:09:49.424]  You know, you're trained not to be a prisoner.
[02:09:49.464 --> 02:09:50.144]  He starts searching it.
[02:09:50.964 --> 02:09:51.604]  This is in the news.
[02:09:51.624 --> 02:09:52.124]  We interviewed her.
[02:09:53.145 --> 02:09:54.365]  And, uh, he goes, uh-uh.
[02:09:54.485 --> 02:09:55.406]  Put her in handcuffs.
[02:09:55.466 --> 02:09:56.126]  Called the police.
[02:09:56.166 --> 02:09:56.746]  She went to jail.
[02:09:57.461 --> 02:10:02.845]  And then they said, OK, we're taking your last semester, you've got to go to summer school now to get your high school diploma.
[02:10:02.925 --> 02:10:03.965]  Now the Victorian's gone.
[02:10:04.826 --> 02:10:09.369]  Because there were plastic knives and they are serrated and they can be used as a weapon.
[02:10:10.710 --> 02:10:21.897]  There are other cases of where it's always prominent students it seems to be, because that's what gets the attention that they're being persecuted too, is they'll bring Tylenol or Ibuprofen or Midol.
[02:10:21.937 --> 02:10:24.439]  I've seen that with women, with these young ladies.
[02:10:25.467 --> 02:10:28.968]  And you gotta have a doctor's prescription for Tylenol in school.
[02:10:29.928 --> 02:10:31.008]  And they throw the book at you.
[02:10:31.208 --> 02:10:39.430]  The school simultaneously pushes Ritalin and Prozac, you know, deadly chemicals on you, but then if you have just some over-the-counter nothing, they throw the book at you.
[02:10:41.091 --> 02:10:50.173]  I mean, the cops think it's normal now in places like Goose Creek, North Carolina, to just come in, have everybody line up, have police dogs grab their bags and rip them open and search everyone and then no drugs are found.
[02:10:51.952 --> 02:10:53.073]  They think it's normal to do that.
[02:10:53.093 --> 02:10:55.215]  I mean, this is mass warping of the mind.
[02:10:55.976 --> 02:10:59.158]  Meanwhile, the narcotics are brought in by the government, and they're pushing them on the kids.
[02:10:59.859 --> 02:11:00.520]  The illegal ones.
[02:11:02.401 --> 02:11:06.285]  So, this has a good chance of happening to your children.
[02:11:06.345 --> 02:11:07.426]  And let me explain something.
[02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:09.107]  I don't just hear about this in the news.
[02:11:09.207 --> 02:11:10.548]  I don't just read about this in the press.
[02:11:10.989 --> 02:11:12.350]  I don't just hear about this on the radio.
[02:11:13.211 --> 02:11:16.253]  Every few months, I hear about middle class people.
[02:11:17.254 --> 02:11:17.915]  Rich people.
[02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:20.532]  In circles that I'm in.
[02:11:21.092 --> 02:11:22.172]  Working class people.
[02:11:24.413 --> 02:11:29.755]  Where their child, their three-year-old, is jumping around the bed and jumps off and breaks their ankle.
[02:11:30.915 --> 02:11:34.697]  Or jumps off and gets their leg hung in the side of the bed and breaks the toe.
[02:11:36.117 --> 02:11:42.079]  Or where a child in front of witnesses is four years old going across the monkey bars and falls and breaks a leg.
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:44.900]  My mother broke her arm climbing a tree.
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:47.081]  She'd have been CPS'd and gone forever, folks.
[02:11:47.995 --> 02:11:50.696]  And you can go in and the first thing they do is snatch your children.
[02:11:51.176 --> 02:11:51.916]  You need to know that.
[02:11:52.437 --> 02:11:59.379]  And all you cops out there and CPS workers, I bet bottom dollar, 95% of you broke a finger, broke a foot, broke an arm.
[02:12:00.539 --> 02:12:03.721]  And you went home and said, oh my gosh, Mama, oh my gosh, Daddy, it hurts.
[02:12:04.201 --> 02:12:06.502]  And they said, that's okay, Junior, that's okay, Missy.
[02:12:07.162 --> 02:12:10.343]  And they loaded you up in the car and they drove you to the hospital and they set your arm.
[02:12:12.293 --> 02:12:13.674]  That's not how it is now, folks.
[02:12:13.734 --> 02:12:15.256]  I dislocated my shoulder one time.
[02:12:15.316 --> 02:12:19.279]  The doctor came right into that Mesquite Hospital, and he said, did your family do this to you?
[02:12:19.299 --> 02:12:26.225]  And I said, no, I was at the pool, and we were wrestling, and I didn't know it was dislocated until I got home.
[02:12:26.265 --> 02:12:28.487]  I couldn't really move it, but it hurts bad, Doc.
[02:12:28.547 --> 02:12:28.887]  Fix it.
[02:12:29.848 --> 02:12:31.990]  Are you sure no one in your family did this?
[02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:34.192]  There's secret police everywhere.
[02:12:35.297 --> 02:12:39.699]  Oh, but let's not stop 30 million illegal aliens with fake ID cards on welfare.
[02:12:39.739 --> 02:12:41.680]  And my point is, I'm not even attacking those people.
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:47.162]  The point is... The point is, you think you're safe out there.
[02:12:47.342 --> 02:12:48.783]  The point is, you think you're okay.
[02:12:49.863 --> 02:12:51.904]  You're gonna find out when one of these things happens.
[02:12:54.205 --> 02:12:57.306]  And there was another case of where she was the salutatorian.
[02:12:59.567 --> 02:13:02.208]  Favorite of the school, you know, was the Southern school.
[02:13:02.228 --> 02:13:03.069]  I think it was Tennessee.
[02:13:03.089 --> 02:13:03.929]  I remember interviewing her.
[02:13:05.342 --> 02:13:05.723]  I don't know.
[02:13:25.581 --> 02:13:34.123]  Knives, forks, and they were in the plastic case with the open front, where you can see the knives, and there were steak knives sitting right there.
[02:13:34.664 --> 02:13:54.009]  Now imagine if a normal, zero tolerance security guard walks by, sees plates, sees stuff, sees a thing with a bunch of spoons, forks, and knives, didn't matter, went into school, called her up, put her in handcuffs, took her to jail, that too was at the end of the school year, she forfeited her semester, had to go to summer school, didn't get to enter college.
[02:13:56.707 --> 02:13:59.368]  They took, they'd already had graduation, but they didn't care.
[02:13:59.388 --> 02:14:03.850]  They just went ahead and took what she had, because she had her car full of shopping goods.
[02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:07.751]  Now, this is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:08.911 --> 02:14:10.232]  And, uh, this is what they do.
[02:14:12.133 --> 02:14:13.193]  And it's gonna get worse.
[02:14:14.874 --> 02:14:21.336]  They're now passing new environmental laws where they find a AA battery in your backyard, five years in prison.
[02:14:22.865 --> 02:14:24.186]  States are passing these laws.
[02:14:24.746 --> 02:14:27.988]  Environmental laws with new environmental cadres and bureaucracies.
[02:14:28.348 --> 02:14:29.828]  You ever read the Declaration of Independence?
[02:14:29.868 --> 02:14:33.050]  How the king sent four swarms of agents to eat out our substance?
[02:14:35.411 --> 02:14:40.514]  I mean, they're going to control how big your house is, any remodeling, home inspections by environmental guilds.
[02:14:40.534 --> 02:14:42.915]  You'll have to buy carbon credits from them.
[02:14:43.355 --> 02:14:44.555]  Hundreds of new taxes.
[02:14:44.656 --> 02:14:46.136]  A reign of terror.
[02:14:46.696 --> 02:14:49.638]  You think it's bad them taking farm property and land from people.
[02:14:50.623 --> 02:14:54.085]  Under the guise of environmentalism, it's about to begin.
[02:14:54.846 --> 02:14:57.267]  The fun is about to start.
[02:15:00.769 --> 02:15:04.751]  We have only hit the tip of the proverbial iceberg.
[02:15:05.852 --> 02:15:13.336]  And I'm begging each and every one of you to educate yourself about Agenda 21, about UNESCO, about the UN Treaties, about the system we're going under right now.
[02:15:15.318 --> 02:15:17.539]  Because it's all spelled out in black and white.
[02:15:19.081 --> 02:15:25.145]  Look, they can't just come take your house or your farm or inspect your house or take over your life without excuses.
[02:15:25.325 --> 02:15:26.966]  Oh, it's the carbon footprint.
[02:15:27.146 --> 02:15:31.128]  Oh, it's the... And guess who started modern environmentalism over a hundred years ago?
[02:15:32.269 --> 02:15:35.390]  This is in mainline books on environmentalism that are pro-environmentalism.
[02:15:35.691 --> 02:15:36.551]  The Rockefellers.
[02:15:37.432 --> 02:15:43.075]  They created eugenics, or they codified it and pushed it and created its modern version.
[02:15:44.255 --> 02:15:45.016]  They created it all.
[02:15:46.730 --> 02:15:51.934]  I mean, we don't just make them like supermen, like four or five Lex Luthors.
[02:15:52.294 --> 02:15:54.335]  They literally are a bunch of Lex Luthors.
[02:15:54.416 --> 02:15:55.516]  You understand that?
[02:15:58.498 --> 02:16:03.962]  And they created the vaccine movement, and they own most of the private hospitals in the nation today.
[02:16:04.002 --> 02:16:05.744]  They control them through foundations, tax-free.
[02:16:06.544 --> 02:16:07.785]  They're the ones doing it to you.
[02:16:08.986 --> 02:16:12.148]  Nine times out of ten or more, you've got cancer, you can thank them.
[02:16:13.609 --> 02:16:16.111]  Nine times out of ten, you've got Crohn's disease, you can thank them.
[02:16:17.498 --> 02:16:23.024]  You got some environmental group taking your property and five years later they build condos on it and they set up what's going to be a wildlife reserve?
[02:16:23.344 --> 02:16:24.005]  You can thank them.
[02:16:25.126 --> 02:16:25.887]  They're behind it all.
[02:16:27.869 --> 02:16:29.631]  They are literally behind almost everything.
[02:16:30.372 --> 02:16:31.974]  They are a curse on this land.
[02:16:32.014 --> 02:16:33.636]  They are pure evil.
[02:16:35.117 --> 02:16:39.342]  And a clip of them is coming up joking about controlling the world on the History Channel.
[02:16:40.729 --> 02:16:47.151]  So, we'll be discussing that, and Kevin Booth will be in here as well with his new American Drug War film, three-plus years in the making.
[02:16:47.211 --> 02:16:48.512]  I know we also have loaded phones.
[02:16:49.272 --> 02:16:56.234]  Holland, Joe, John, Jack, Charles, and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[02:16:57.435 --> 02:16:59.395]  Again, I'm very honored that you listen to the show.
[02:16:59.415 --> 02:17:04.777]  I'm very honored that so many AM and FM stations have picked up the show over the years, and so many new stations are turning us on.
[02:17:05.839 --> 02:17:06.820]  I'm very humbled by that.
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:13.323]  I'm very thankful for you spreading the word about TruthNews.us and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:13.383 --> 02:17:21.787]  I would just briefly add that for the month of December, you can get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:21.887 --> 02:17:22.287]  That's right.
[02:17:22.788 --> 02:17:29.491]  When you go sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv for a yearly membership, close to half that year, price is lopped off.
[02:17:29.511 --> 02:17:33.213]  It comes out to you pay for 6.7 months and you get 5.3 months free.
[02:17:35.905 --> 02:17:39.847]  And that's for the month of December at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:17:40.488 --> 02:17:43.209]  So go get a membership, or it's not too late to give it as a Christmas gift.
[02:17:44.970 --> 02:17:48.412]  Ted Anderson, remind us, December 19, 2007, gold, 830 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $824.47, $406.35 per half, $203.18 per quarter.
[02:17:48.452 --> 02:17:49.072]  That's $824.47, $406.35, and $203.18.
[02:17:58.894 --> 02:18:02.176]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[02:18:02.477 --> 02:18:06.680]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:11.023]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[02:18:11.423 --> 02:18:13.244]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[02:18:13.745 --> 02:18:15.426]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[02:18:15.706 --> 02:18:21.711]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[02:18:21.971 --> 02:18:28.757]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[02:18:29.097 --> 02:18:29.978]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[02:18:29.998 --> 02:18:30.298]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:30.318 --> 02:18:33.300]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:33.881]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:33.901 --> 02:18:35.242]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:45.951]  Attention!
[02:18:46.071 --> 02:18:48.895]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:18:49.195 --> 02:18:53.481]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:18:53.801 --> 02:18:54.482]  Listen closely.
[02:18:55.443 --> 02:19:00.350]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product considered to be the single
[02:19:00.350 --> 02:19:00.790]  I think so.
[02:19:17.757 --> 02:19:27.224]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[02:19:27.424 --> 02:19:33.048]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.

[02:19:37.051 --> 02:19:40.394]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[02:19:46.263 --> 02:19:50.044]  As the old saying goes, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
[02:19:50.224 --> 02:19:55.746]  But if you give him a Berkey system, you give him the ability to obtain purified water for a lifetime.
[02:19:56.046 --> 02:20:01.128]  This year, when giving Christmas gifts, instead of unwanted trinkets, give a meaningful and substantial gift.
[02:20:01.468 --> 02:20:01.888]  We're good to go!
[02:20:25.974 --> 02:20:28.756]  Check out our Christmas specials at Berkeywater.com.

[02:20:34.759 --> 02:20:36.560]  That's Berkeywater.com or call 888-03-4438.
[02:20:36.580 --> 02:20:36.940]  That's 888-03-4438.
[02:20:44.002 --> 02:20:47.183]  Yes, there is an In-Dash AM-FM shortwave radio.
[02:20:47.463 --> 02:20:55.565]  For limited time and in limited numbers, the Sony GT-160S AM-FM shortwave radio and CD player is available only at the Power Hour.
[02:20:55.825 --> 02:21:03.907]  This radio is designed to eliminate interference from ignition systems and the result is clear, clean reception, so you can hear your favorite broadcasts both domestically and internationally.
[02:21:04.207 --> 02:21:08.028]  Get your Sony AM-FM shortwave radio and CD player from the Power Hour today.
[02:21:08.428 --> 02:21:10.130]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:14.654]  That's 877-817-9829 to order.
[02:21:15.014 --> 02:21:18.757]  Only $249 plus shipping and handling, and we'll ship it right to you.
[02:21:19.057 --> 02:21:21.299]  There's even an input to plug in an external source.
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:27.445]  Your MP3 player, your iPod, your DVD player, or any other source will sound great through your new Sony receiver.
[02:21:27.745 --> 02:21:30.707]  These radios are not available anywhere else and for a limited time.
[02:21:30.927 --> 02:21:31.587]  So call now.
[02:21:31.827 --> 02:21:33.548]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:21:34.049 --> 02:21:43.214]  That's 877-817-9829 and get your Sony GT-160S AM FM shortwave radio and CD player from the Power Hour.
[02:21:43.234 --> 02:21:46.876]  This call is from a federal crew desk.
[02:21:47.216 --> 02:21:49.937]  Don't touch that or you'll... If it's electric, you'll die.
[02:21:50.137 --> 02:21:54.520]  We don't screw around here.
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:56.341]  This isn't Texas.
[02:22:06.065 --> 02:22:14.389]  We must wage what I have called total war against public enemy number one in the United States, the problem of dangerous drugs.
[02:22:14.409 --> 02:22:19.352]  80% of the cops shot in this area were shot because people are high on drugs.
[02:22:19.912 --> 02:22:21.693]  So we want to give drugs to everybody.
[02:22:21.733 --> 02:22:23.073]  Let them all shoot the cops.
[02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:47.588]  I had lost two family members and a best friend in a very short span of time to alcohol, cigarettes, and illegal prescription drugs.
[02:22:48.328 --> 02:22:55.513]  So fearing that I could be next due to my own struggle with addiction, I wanted to find out why the drug war seemed to be such a huge failure.
[02:22:56.451 --> 02:22:59.555]  General Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex.
[02:22:59.595 --> 02:23:02.939]  Well, he might as well have warned us about the drug complex.
[02:23:17.265 --> 02:23:21.690]  Alright folks, that is the audio from the video trailer, American Drug War.
[02:23:21.790 --> 02:23:22.630]  AmericanDrugWar.com.
[02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:24.112]  Three plus years in the making.
[02:23:37.416 --> 02:23:40.018]  And Kevin's going to be premiering it here tomorrow night.
[02:23:40.058 --> 02:23:44.962]  It cost money to get in, but his Lordship is going to offer you again free tickets.
[02:23:44.982 --> 02:23:50.366]  I'm told about 200 of our listeners showed up and helped fill the place up at a huge event Kevin had in LA.
[02:23:50.406 --> 02:23:51.707]  He offered free tickets to our audience.
[02:23:51.727 --> 02:23:53.529]  So here's more free goodies for you.
[02:23:53.549 --> 02:23:58.212]  We don't normally do free goodies things on the show, but we're doing that now.
[02:23:58.272 --> 02:24:02.496]  And so with us for the rest of the transmission, we'll also get to some of your calls in this Rockefeller News.
[02:24:03.436 --> 02:24:08.758]  Is Kevin Booth, my good friend, formerly of Texas, now a wicked Californian.
[02:24:10.218 --> 02:24:11.118]  Buddy, it's good to see you.
[02:24:11.418 --> 02:24:12.358]  Good to see you, Alex.
[02:24:12.558 --> 02:24:13.899]  I feel like I'm shaking hands here.
[02:24:14.419 --> 02:24:15.739]  You can hardly reach across there.
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:18.560]  It's good to see you.
[02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:21.321]  I mean, American Drug War, it's really powerful.
[02:24:21.521 --> 02:24:22.701]  You spent a lot of years on this.
[02:24:22.721 --> 02:24:24.081]  We had you on a few months ago about this.
[02:24:24.602 --> 02:24:25.742]  But, I mean, just break down.
[02:24:27.422 --> 02:24:28.903]  The film's going to be on Showtime, too.
[02:24:29.443 --> 02:24:30.363]  I mean, tell us about this film.
[02:24:31.506 --> 02:24:34.349]  It's actually been four plus years now, believe it.
[02:24:34.369 --> 02:24:34.989]  Started in 2003.
[02:24:35.250 --> 02:24:40.314]  It's just been a long labor of love.
[02:24:40.794 --> 02:24:52.364]  Recently, one of the most exciting things, we just got back from New Orleans where we screened this thing for a bunch of former narcotics officers, former DEA agents at this big drug policy event that they have every year.
[02:24:52.384 --> 02:24:55.267]  This year it was in New Orleans because the drug war is so bad in New Orleans.
[02:24:55.891 --> 02:25:02.975]  And it was incredible being able to show a film about the drug war to all these people and not one person in the audience who disagreed.
[02:25:03.015 --> 02:25:05.096]  And these are like narcotics officers watching this.
[02:25:05.116 --> 02:25:06.357]  Well, they all know it's a joke.
[02:25:06.397 --> 02:25:11.019]  All it does is get cops killed and then it gets the criminals involved in the drug trade because there's a lot of money.
[02:25:11.439 --> 02:25:12.680]  Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:14.481]  And so, you know, now there's groups out there.
[02:25:14.501 --> 02:25:17.943]  I don't know if you've heard of this group called LEAP, which is Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[02:25:18.786 --> 02:25:29.193]  And, you know, this is thousands of basically former narcotics officers, guys that spent their entire lives putting young kids in jail for what they now know are ridiculous reasons.
[02:25:29.233 --> 02:25:33.516]  They now know what they did was wrong, and they're going to try to spend the rest of their lives trying to undo it.
[02:25:33.536 --> 02:25:38.060]  And we've got three lead speakers in the film, Celorito Castillo, who is in New Orleans with us.
[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:44.264]  We've got Judge Jim Gray and Governor Gary Johnson in the film.
[02:25:45.084 --> 02:25:46.325]  Now, it's an amazing film.
[02:25:46.425 --> 02:25:47.166]  Now, I'm sick.
[02:25:47.975 --> 02:25:51.336]  And I'm trying to get better, but I'm going to try to come out to the event tomorrow night.
[02:25:51.376 --> 02:25:55.518]  Before we go any further into the film, which is just amazing, tell folks about where it's showing tomorrow night.
[02:25:55.738 --> 02:26:00.640]  Okay, tomorrow night at Antone's Nightclub, I believe it's on 5th Street, the famous Antone's.
[02:26:01.061 --> 02:26:02.341]  The Chronicle got the time wrong.
[02:26:02.581 --> 02:26:05.702]  The doors open at 6, and the film starts at 7.
[02:26:05.823 --> 02:26:08.163]  So the Chronicle got the time wrong in the list.
[02:26:08.204 --> 02:26:09.104]  What did the Chronicle say?
[02:26:09.124 --> 02:26:10.404]  I think they said 10 o'clock.
[02:26:10.745 --> 02:26:13.626]  Well, the Chronicle says that Centro of Spain isn't Spanish-owned.
[02:26:14.286 --> 02:26:16.227]  Taken over the road, so it's probably on purpose.
[02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:19.669]  Very deceptive crew of ne'er-do-wells over there.
[02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:22.392]  But not all of them, but the leadership.
[02:26:23.432 --> 02:26:25.214]  So that's 6 o'clock tomorrow at Antons.
[02:26:25.334 --> 02:26:26.395]  Yeah, 6 o'clock.
[02:26:26.455 --> 02:26:34.021]  And I'm not sure how we should do this other than we'd say the first 50 people to get in line before the doors open can get in for free.
[02:26:34.361 --> 02:26:35.602]  I don't know how else we can do this.
[02:26:35.622 --> 02:26:36.683]  So that's all they're letting you.
[02:26:36.743 --> 02:26:38.364]  Now you gave away hundreds of tickets last time.
[02:26:38.764 --> 02:26:42.966]  Yeah, that was like a thousand seat venue.
[02:26:43.006 --> 02:26:44.567]  And I heard it was filled up, too.
[02:26:44.767 --> 02:26:46.387]  Yeah, it was great, and I appreciate that.
[02:26:46.407 --> 02:26:48.508]  You got a lot of listeners there in Southern California.
[02:26:48.548 --> 02:26:49.769]  What, you said about 200 showed up?
[02:26:49.789 --> 02:26:50.449]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:53.290]  And a lot of Ron Paul supporters out there.
[02:26:53.310 --> 02:27:00.814]  Everywhere we go, in fact, we just got back from touring England with the film, and at every single British event, people were asking me about Ron Paul.
[02:27:00.834 --> 02:27:01.574]  I thought that was great.
[02:27:02.748 --> 02:27:04.709]  According to Glenn Beck, he's with El Canino.
[02:27:07.189 --> 02:27:08.290]  It's getting more and more insane.
[02:27:08.330 --> 02:27:11.551]  Kevin, let's talk about your film and some of the things we didn't get into last time.
[02:27:11.571 --> 02:27:15.392]  I mean, you went and hung out in crack ditches, you know, in L.A.
[02:27:15.412 --> 02:27:17.292]  I mean, people shooting up.
[02:27:17.373 --> 02:27:18.753]  I mean, you did a lot of dangerous stuff.
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:21.961]  Black guys running around out of their mind on PCP.
[02:27:22.001 --> 02:27:23.961]  Cops waving machine guns around.
[02:27:23.981 --> 02:27:27.042]  I mean, I've seen some of the raw footage too.
[02:27:27.723 --> 02:27:29.583]  There's been several incarnations of this film.
[02:27:30.143 --> 02:27:32.084]  We'll be right back with Kevin Booth on the other side.
[02:27:32.104 --> 02:27:33.784]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.105 --> 02:27:36.085]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.505 --> 02:27:38.126]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.026 --> 02:27:41.727]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.935 --> 02:27:50.578]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[02:27:50.778 --> 02:27:55.920]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:01.283]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease.
[02:28:01.583 --> 02:28:03.344]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[02:28:03.604 --> 02:28:07.166]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:28:07.486 --> 02:28:13.470]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:17.232]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:28:17.492 --> 02:28:22.035]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:28:22.315 --> 02:28:23.096]  Do your part.
[02:28:23.356 --> 02:28:25.617]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[02:28:44.497 --> 02:28:49.059]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:28:49.459 --> 02:28:52.401]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:28:52.721 --> 02:28:55.282]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:55.642 --> 02:29:00.464]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:00.844 --> 02:29:06.207]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:06.527 --> 02:29:09.488]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:29:09.668 --> 02:29:10.229]  We're good to go.
[02:29:33.072 --> 02:29:33.313]  We're good.
[02:29:44.631 --> 02:29:47.553]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:29:47.713 --> 02:29:52.917]  How about fluorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:29:53.237 --> 02:29:58.521]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:29:58.941 --> 02:30:00.082]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:00.442 --> 02:30:09.308]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[02:30:09.748 --> 02:30:11.350]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[02:30:56.678 --> 02:30:59.060]  It'll build the death planes.
[02:31:01.001 --> 02:31:02.922]  It'll build all the bombs.
[02:31:05.403 --> 02:31:07.804]  It'll hide behind walls.
[02:31:09.705 --> 02:31:11.566]  It'll hide behind desks.
[02:31:13.888 --> 02:31:18.110]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[02:31:20.884 --> 02:31:36.792]  Kevin Booth, director and producer of American Drug War, what do you think the establishment is going to do now that in every major poll upwards of 70% of Americans know that drug prohibition is a joke?
[02:31:36.812 --> 02:31:44.956]  I mean, you have the big pharma and half the TV ads during the nightly news and magazine ads for psychotropic drugs, Ritalin-type drugs,
[02:31:45.575 --> 02:31:55.999]  Who's molecular makeup is much more toxic and much more addictive and much more powerful than even these illegal narcotics that absolutely are bad news.
[02:31:56.719 --> 02:31:59.621]  I mean, you know, you say drugs pretty much killed your brother.
[02:31:59.641 --> 02:32:02.842]  You know, you say alcohol pretty much killed your parents.
[02:32:03.842 --> 02:32:05.003]  You talk about that in the film.
[02:32:05.103 --> 02:32:08.024]  I knew your parents, really liked your parents, knew them for many years, great people.
[02:32:08.844 --> 02:32:11.545]  It just seems like yesterday we were at the ranch hanging out with them and they're gone.
[02:32:13.835 --> 02:32:17.881]  The statistics where you're hundreds of times more likely to die of alcohol or prescription drugs.
[02:32:18.141 --> 02:32:18.962]  They don't care, though.
[02:32:19.343 --> 02:32:22.187]  And then, yeah, they do grab young kids the first time they're caught with cocaine.
[02:32:22.447 --> 02:32:23.509]  It's five years in prison.
[02:32:24.070 --> 02:32:27.815]  And I'll talk, now, a lot of cops are waking up and some of them are just like, no, drugs are evil, I gotta get them.
[02:32:28.075 --> 02:32:29.257]  Look at all the crime they create.
[02:32:30.097 --> 02:32:31.179]  They've got it backwards.
[02:32:31.379 --> 02:32:36.146]  It's that they make it illegal, then that grows the crime, as alcohol prohibition did.
[02:32:36.166 --> 02:32:37.027]  I mean, that's a no-brainer.
[02:32:37.067 --> 02:32:38.248]  So what is the establishment?
[02:32:38.589 --> 02:32:40.131]  Your film really covers this in a great way.
[02:32:40.652 --> 02:32:41.433]  It's a masterpiece.
[02:32:41.453 --> 02:32:43.516]  I mean, I saw it two years ago and didn't think what you'd done.
[02:32:43.536 --> 02:32:44.177]  I thought it was good.
[02:32:44.898 --> 02:32:45.238]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:32:45.258 --> 02:32:47.079]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[02:33:10.508 --> 02:33:18.654]  You know, all I know is that even when, what's so weird about it is that when you talk to any of these people, it's like a group think thing.
[02:33:18.674 --> 02:33:24.698]  When you get a cop or anybody alone by themselves and you ask them, do you really think marijuana should be illegal?
[02:33:24.818 --> 02:33:27.040]  They'll never ever say, yes, I do.
[02:33:28.181 --> 02:33:32.684]  It's only when they're all packed together, these drug warriors, that they can say that.
[02:33:32.724 --> 02:33:35.506]  And the marijuana equation is very important to this because
[02:33:36.158 --> 02:33:46.787]  Because, you know, and this is an important statistic in the film, that 85% of all American drug users are all Americans that use illegal drugs.
[02:33:46.927 --> 02:33:47.468]  Okay?
[02:33:47.668 --> 02:33:52.011]  85% of all Americans that use illegal drugs only use marijuana.
[02:33:52.572 --> 02:33:52.852]  Okay?
[02:33:53.292 --> 02:33:54.874]  So if you remove marijuana,
[02:33:55.461 --> 02:33:58.864]  From the equation, the entire drug war is going to crumble.
[02:33:58.884 --> 02:34:00.065]  85% of the drug war is gone.
[02:34:00.265 --> 02:34:00.786]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:00.806 --> 02:34:01.787]  They're going to lose everything.
[02:34:01.847 --> 02:34:03.908]  So they have to keep marijuana.
[02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:13.357]  And that's why they have to keep pushing that marijuana belongs in Schedule 1 alongside things like PCP and crystal meth and crack cocaine, which is absolute insanity.
[02:34:13.857 --> 02:34:14.778]  And everybody knows it.
[02:34:15.178 --> 02:34:17.340]  You know, you've got this herb that grows out of the ground.
[02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:18.321]  People have been using it for
[02:34:18.982 --> 02:34:19.882]  Thousands of years.
[02:34:19.902 --> 02:34:22.163]  All it does is make you show on your butt and eat pizza.
[02:34:22.524 --> 02:34:32.588]  And it's also proven that they've yet to ever come up with anything that deals with the side effects of chemotherapy or AIDS treatments or any of these type of things as good as marijuana does.
[02:34:32.628 --> 02:34:37.730]  I mean, basically, when people get sick, like when my dad got cancer, when Bill got cancer, it's the same thing.
[02:34:37.770 --> 02:34:38.371]  People can't eat.
[02:34:38.411 --> 02:34:39.591]  They lose their appetite.
[02:34:39.731 --> 02:34:43.273]  Did your dad have to smoke bud when he was... No, he couldn't because he was in Texas.
[02:34:44.114 --> 02:34:45.234]  He thought it was the devil.
[02:34:45.254 --> 02:34:46.135]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:34:46.175 --> 02:34:47.996]  He didn't want anything to do with it.
[02:34:48.036 --> 02:34:52.839]  If he had been in California and grown up in a different era, maybe it would have been different.
[02:34:52.879 --> 02:34:53.260]  I don't know.
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:35:00.064]  It was sad to watch him go through that thing and knowing that there is a better medicine form out there, he wouldn't even try it.
[02:35:00.665 --> 02:35:09.751]  But they have yet to come up with anything that would work as good as cannabis for people that need help with their appetite.
[02:35:10.905 --> 02:35:12.468]  I mean, it's just, you know, it's sad.
[02:35:12.888 --> 02:35:19.399]  Well, a whole bunch of states passed laws saying that you could have her from medical reasons and the feds said no, no, no.
[02:35:20.089 --> 02:35:29.754]  Well, you know, I live in Southern California right now, and it's a very crazy thing, because it's a perfect example of the federal government being out of step with the state government.
[02:35:29.774 --> 02:35:34.316]  I mean, even the local law enforcement, even the LAPD, is not against medical marijuana.
[02:35:34.336 --> 02:35:43.061]  And the DEA will keep pushing these same myths down your throat, such as, well, wherever these medical marijuana dispensaries go in, it's going to be like a crime-riddled neighborhood.
[02:35:43.101 --> 02:35:44.301]  No, that's the liquor store.
[02:35:44.381 --> 02:35:45.862]  The liquor store is where that happens.
[02:35:45.902 --> 02:35:47.763]  Wherever these medical marijuana clinics go in,
[02:35:48.283 --> 02:35:50.603]  It's like having a high-class Starbucks.
[02:35:50.623 --> 02:35:54.364]  These are rich, clean, nice, safe places.
[02:35:55.204 --> 02:35:56.564]  It's just crazy.
[02:35:56.604 --> 02:35:58.765]  It brings a lot of money into the community.
[02:36:00.005 --> 02:36:03.066]  There's no crime related to medical marijuana.
[02:36:03.146 --> 02:36:05.106]  It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[02:36:06.106 --> 02:36:16.128]  And the other fantasy that the DEA keeps talking about lately is that marijuana these days is 30 times stronger than it was back in the 60s and 70s.
[02:36:16.148 --> 02:36:16.828]  Well, first of all,
[02:36:17.606 --> 02:36:35.351]  It's funny because the people that I know that use medical marijuana back in California, a lot of them are actors, lawyers, doctors, you know, these people live good lives and they use this very, you know, clean grown stuff and it's people that smoke the crummier stuff that are like the
[02:36:37.046 --> 02:36:38.887]  Yeah, that's because it has a different type of THC effect.
[02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:51.491]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:36:51.511 --> 02:36:53.793]  It's actually different and people don't know that.
[02:36:54.273 --> 02:36:56.035]  The real weed heads do know that.
[02:36:56.075 --> 02:36:58.597]  Yeah, but it's prohibition that causes everybody.
[02:36:58.617 --> 02:37:05.063]  I mean, basically one of the points in the film, I mean, I make the point in the film that crystal meth is the modern day moonshine.
[02:37:05.103 --> 02:37:11.589]  Because what did you have during the years of prohibition, people started, people are going to do whatever they can to get high or to get a buzz.
[02:37:11.610 --> 02:37:14.072]  You're not going to stop people from wanting to change the reality.
[02:37:14.092 --> 02:37:16.114]  They've done it since the beginning of time, they always will.
[02:37:16.634 --> 02:37:22.437]  If you just take things away, people will just start eating dirt, or just whatever they can to make themselves feel different.
[02:37:23.017 --> 02:37:30.960]  So, when you take away everybody's, like, you know, the natural things that God left growing naturally on the earth... So they go to the thing that's made out of a bunch of chemicals.
[02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:31.481]  Exactly!
[02:37:31.521 --> 02:37:42.325]  So you've got kids making crystal meth, which is a... it's a possible... there's nothing else that could be any worse than having kids mixing up dangerous chemicals and smoking it and injecting it.
[02:37:42.405 --> 02:37:43.506]  I can't think of anything worse.
[02:37:46.198 --> 02:37:48.400]  Now, that's only one facet of your film.
[02:37:49.361 --> 02:37:52.644]  You break down the numbers, and you have conservative numbers, but they're still amazing.
[02:37:52.864 --> 02:37:54.105]  The numbers I've got are even worse.
[02:37:54.606 --> 02:37:56.747]  But you went with conservative numbers, and that's because it's all getting better.
[02:37:56.767 --> 02:37:57.648]  It's going to be on Showtime.
[02:37:58.529 --> 02:38:03.353]  About how many people die from alcohol versus all of the so-called illegal drugs.
[02:38:03.874 --> 02:38:04.394]  Right, right.
[02:38:04.414 --> 02:38:09.539]  Well, I mean, in the film we say that, you know, about 450,000 die every year from tobacco.
[02:38:11.747 --> 02:38:15.610]  About 150,000 die from alcohol-related illnesses.
[02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:20.093]  Now, that does not include, you know, car fatalities, accidents.
[02:38:20.273 --> 02:38:24.597]  That's just, you know, illnesses, cirrhosis of the liver and so forth.
[02:38:24.617 --> 02:38:25.798]  100,000 from prescription.
[02:38:25.858 --> 02:38:27.619]  And my brother actually died from
[02:38:28.092 --> 02:38:32.933]  Complications of taking legal doses of legal prescription drugs that caused him to have a seizure.
[02:38:32.953 --> 02:38:40.176]  I mean, he was taking the amount of legally prescribed pharmaceutical drugs to control schizophrenia for a third year.
[02:38:40.196 --> 02:38:41.056]  But that's what happens.
[02:38:41.096 --> 02:38:44.797]  They start with a kid saying, you're mentally ill with one drug, then they actually go crazy from the drug.
[02:38:45.077 --> 02:38:47.778]  By the time they're done, like the average Texas foster kid's on seven,
[02:38:48.338 --> 02:38:49.518]  And then they start having seizures.
[02:38:49.558 --> 02:38:53.699]  That's what WAI-TV found, is they put them on so many drugs they start having seizures.
[02:38:53.759 --> 02:39:01.121]  Yeah, I mean, by the time you're 35 years old, you've got to have a medicine box because you've got like 10, 15 different prescriptions going.
[02:39:01.161 --> 02:39:03.981]  And, you know, these people are just rattling because they take so many pills.
[02:39:04.621 --> 02:39:05.562]  You know, and it's sad.
[02:39:05.602 --> 02:39:08.162]  And they cause you to, you know, I mean, the chemicals.
[02:39:08.242 --> 02:39:17.744]  And they don't, you know, it's just like, do you want to trust a guy in a lab coat who's out there trying to make a buck, just like these other people trying to push this nonsense about
[02:39:18.805 --> 02:39:27.011]  Well, by the way, you know, they start these random drug tests on kids in school.
[02:39:27.711 --> 02:39:38.740]  If they get your child in the system, and I've seen this over and over again, nine times out of ten, kids that... I know young people who would like to smoke a joint every once in a while, people on the football team with me.
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:42.423]  And one of my friends, Doug, just started smoking pot.
[02:39:42.443 --> 02:39:43.924]  His parents grabbed him in Dallas.
[02:39:44.602 --> 02:39:48.485]  And put him in this facility where they chained him down for months and tortured him.
[02:39:48.545 --> 02:39:53.349]  And when he came out, he was rebellious from then on out and did every drug you could imagine.
[02:39:53.369 --> 02:39:53.810]  Of course.
[02:39:53.910 --> 02:39:55.351]  And I knew a bunch of kids like that.
[02:39:55.711 --> 02:39:57.873]  And I saw that and I thought, man, I'm not going to do this stuff.
[02:39:58.173 --> 02:39:59.554]  Yeah.
[02:39:59.574 --> 02:40:01.616]  Because I saw immediately, I said, this is a business.
[02:40:01.636 --> 02:40:04.238]  Because, you know, all of a sudden the sheriff was the drug dealer in town.
[02:40:04.258 --> 02:40:07.481]  So I was like, I'm not going to use something.
[02:40:07.521 --> 02:40:09.963]  I remember kids thought it was so cool to use drugs.
[02:40:10.183 --> 02:40:10.984]  I never thought it was.
[02:40:13.385 --> 02:40:14.546]  It's just amazing, Kevin.
[02:40:14.786 --> 02:40:16.046]  So your film covers it.
[02:40:16.066 --> 02:40:19.048]  You also have some of the craziest footage I've ever seen of Jack Arpaio.
[02:40:19.928 --> 02:40:23.129]  Oh, yeah, Joe Arpaio.
[02:40:23.189 --> 02:40:25.710]  Yeah, Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[02:40:26.091 --> 02:40:33.074]  I've learned with dealing with some of these drug warrior egomaniacs that the trick to dealing with these people is to laugh at their jokes.
[02:40:33.534 --> 02:40:35.355]  You know, when you're around these egomaniacs.
[02:40:35.395 --> 02:40:36.955]  So I laughed at all of his jokes.
[02:40:37.035 --> 02:40:39.737]  I think I got him to open up a little bit to me.
[02:40:39.797 --> 02:40:40.457]  I caught him
[02:40:41.084 --> 02:40:43.565]  Off guard a little bit, you know, but it was it was tricky.
[02:40:43.585 --> 02:40:49.808]  This is a guy who routinely runs around literally slamming his car through people's businesses, stumbling around with machine guns.
[02:40:50.329 --> 02:40:51.569]  I mean, he's completely nuts.
[02:40:51.629 --> 02:40:53.110]  They have helicopters flying around.
[02:40:53.410 --> 02:40:55.651]  If they see a green pool, they come arrest you.
[02:40:56.232 --> 02:40:58.853]  I mean, it's just always new police state checkpoints.
[02:40:59.333 --> 02:41:02.034]  They have knock and talk where they come and ask about your guns at your house.
[02:41:02.695 --> 02:41:04.556]  I mean, it's just completely out of control.
[02:41:04.636 --> 02:41:05.196]  Yeah, crazy.
[02:41:05.216 --> 02:41:05.456]  Yeah.
[02:41:05.476 --> 02:41:08.978]  The day that I went there, I mean, I was like kind of on this standby where I had to
[02:41:09.518 --> 02:41:13.439]  I had to get there at like 6 in the morning and then with like 15 minutes notice.
[02:41:13.499 --> 02:41:16.660]  And all these gymnasts are worshipping him going, he's the boss, he's the man.
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:17.740]  They're all in pink.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:19.240]  And they all ask for his autograph.
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:22.101]  And he's stumbling around going, I'm the commander.
[02:41:22.121 --> 02:41:23.661]  He's like the big rock star.
[02:41:23.681 --> 02:41:28.742]  He like fumbles and he like wanders through the prison yard and he brags about how he's got the biggest tent city.
[02:41:28.782 --> 02:41:33.443]  I've got to tell you, I mean looking at him, he's either got serious brain problems or he was high out of his gourd.
[02:41:33.803 --> 02:41:34.063]  Yeah.
[02:41:34.483 --> 02:41:37.164]  I think a lot of these drug warriors are drunk most of the time.
[02:41:37.204 --> 02:41:41.486]  Like, when I spent the day with Barry McCaffrey, I guarantee he was, like, drinking martinis the whole day.
[02:41:44.607 --> 02:41:49.949]  No, I mean, every time I've seen him, like, when I couldn't find him, he's just, like, going, uh-huh.
[02:41:50.009 --> 02:41:53.490]  Miffy is a wonderful lad.
[02:41:53.550 --> 02:41:54.350]  Wonderful lad.
[02:41:54.390 --> 02:41:58.592]  The drugs, and we had to walk him away for the rest of his life, and it was good for him.
[02:42:00.085 --> 02:42:08.052]  That's another thing, too, that they have it now where if a kid gets arrested with, say, a joint in high school, they can make it so he can't go to college.
[02:42:08.452 --> 02:42:09.433]  That's a great idea.
[02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:11.255]  Yeah, that's going to help society.
[02:42:11.495 --> 02:42:13.497]  That's going to be a huge help for society.
[02:42:13.537 --> 02:42:14.938]  Keep kids out of college, I say.
[02:42:14.978 --> 02:42:15.278]  Yeah.
[02:42:15.318 --> 02:42:16.159]  A drug war, good.
[02:42:18.441 --> 02:42:22.664]  Now they're telling kids, hey, if you protest, you could get arrested and then not be able to go to college.
[02:42:22.864 --> 02:42:23.124]  Yeah.
[02:42:23.325 --> 02:42:24.606]  It's like, you just better shut up.
[02:42:24.726 --> 02:42:27.488]  And then meanwhile, they just had that CIA plane crash with 3.3 tons of coke.
[02:42:29.295 --> 02:42:29.895]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:29.975 --> 02:42:30.936]  Uncut cocaine.
[02:42:30.976 --> 02:42:44.084]  Yeah, and that's another big story in the film we haven't talked to yet, is that I've actually, to get into these people's world, I've actually become friends with the guy that co-founded the Bloods in Los Angeles, and he's the one that connected me up with Freeway Ricky Ross.
[02:42:44.164 --> 02:42:48.186]  And that was the world exclusive on the show, playing on audio, I appreciate that.
[02:42:48.246 --> 02:42:55.911]  Yeah, and Freeway Ricky Ross is the guy from the whole Gary Webb story, and we talk about Gary Webb's death and all that, but Ricky Ross was known as the Walmart of crack,
[02:42:56.431 --> 02:42:56.791]  I think so.
[02:43:13.944 --> 02:43:19.669]  And you talk about some crazy stories, and we actually become close friends with a guy.
[02:43:19.709 --> 02:43:25.073]  He calls my house from jail, and I swear to God, every time he calls my house, I've got people up on my telephone pole.
[02:43:25.113 --> 02:43:26.134]  I'm not exaggerating.
[02:43:26.174 --> 02:43:27.936]  I take pictures of it every time it happens.
[02:43:28.676 --> 02:43:31.859]  I have a whole stack of pictures of people up on my telephone pole.
[02:43:32.319 --> 02:43:33.180]  And you're up on that mountain.
[02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:36.903]  You live in Lawrence Fishburne's old... Yeah, yeah, I live by Lawrence Fishburne's house.
[02:43:37.143 --> 02:43:38.244]  He thought I was stalking him.
[02:43:38.264 --> 02:43:39.044]  That's another story.
[02:43:39.064 --> 02:43:40.265]  I'll save that one, but yeah.
[02:43:40.446 --> 02:43:40.766]  Oh, really?
[02:43:40.786 --> 02:43:41.366]  What happened there?
[02:43:42.547 --> 02:43:44.409]  Oh, you want me to tell the story about Lawrence Fishburne?
[02:43:44.509 --> 02:43:44.990]  I don't know it.
[02:43:45.531 --> 02:43:46.552]  I think you've told me.
[02:43:46.732 --> 02:43:47.933]  Well, I ran into him somewhere.
[02:43:47.973 --> 02:43:48.634]  He has dogs.
[02:43:48.694 --> 02:43:51.177]  I have dogs who are, you know, out walking our dogs everywhere.
[02:43:51.197 --> 02:43:53.379]  And I ran into him and I said, Hey, I bought that house you lived in.
[02:43:53.399 --> 02:43:55.782]  We talked for a while and I asked him, you know who Bill Hicks was?
[02:43:55.802 --> 02:43:57.083]  Yeah, we talked about Bill Hicks.
[02:43:57.443 --> 02:44:00.206]  So a guy that was working for me actually had his home address from this thing.
[02:44:00.226 --> 02:44:04.211]  So I sent him a book that I wrote about Bill to his home address.
[02:44:04.767 --> 02:44:06.708]  Couple days later, I was out in the middle of the woods.
[02:44:06.728 --> 02:44:09.310]  I'm talking about like five miles away from where you park your cars.
[02:44:09.370 --> 02:44:11.832]  I run into him, out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:44:11.852 --> 02:44:13.833]  And I'm like, did you get that book I sent you?
[02:44:14.854 --> 02:44:16.254]  And he's like, who are you?
[02:44:16.294 --> 02:44:17.475]  Why are you following me?
[02:44:17.495 --> 02:44:24.320]  And then I actually ran into him again in another place.
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:26.581]  And by that time, I had to just pretend like I didn't see him.
[02:44:26.601 --> 02:44:29.223]  It was like he thought I was stalking him.
[02:44:30.023 --> 02:44:31.624]  You know, synchronicity works like that.
[02:44:31.844 --> 02:44:32.105]  Yeah.
[02:44:32.245 --> 02:44:33.185]  There's a serendipity.
[02:44:34.651 --> 02:44:34.951]  Yeah.
[02:44:35.372 --> 02:44:37.513]  Okay, tomorrow night, American Drug War.
[02:44:37.533 --> 02:44:42.016]  It's going to be shown at... Antone's at, doors open at 6.
[02:44:42.716 --> 02:44:43.737]  Show starts at 7.
[02:44:43.857 --> 02:44:44.818]  Alex is going to be there.
[02:44:44.838 --> 02:44:45.658]  Right?
[02:44:45.718 --> 02:44:46.499]  Come on, Alex.
[02:44:46.519 --> 02:44:47.520]  Come on, Alex.
[02:44:47.540 --> 02:44:49.581]  He's going to take a bunch of vitamins after the show.
[02:44:49.621 --> 02:44:50.481]  He's going to feel good.
[02:44:50.501 --> 02:44:51.142]  He's going to be there.
[02:44:51.162 --> 02:44:52.983]  No, it's just all these other Patriot people.
[02:44:53.023 --> 02:44:54.164]  They love to get up in front of crowds.
[02:44:54.264 --> 02:44:55.405]  I've kind of been there, done that.
[02:44:56.285 --> 02:44:59.226]  Besides, I'm afraid I'll get around all that beer and start drinking again.
[02:44:59.246 --> 02:45:00.246]  I've not been drinking lately.
[02:45:00.266 --> 02:45:00.666]  That's good.
[02:45:00.706 --> 02:45:02.267]  But they're telling everybody you're going to be there.
[02:45:02.287 --> 02:45:06.308]  No, I know, but you notice the Idiot Chronicle said it's at ten instead of at six.
[02:45:06.328 --> 02:45:07.108]  That's just one thing.
[02:45:07.168 --> 02:45:07.848]  And then I guess.
[02:45:07.868 --> 02:45:08.949]  I said, you know, the Chronicle hates me.
[02:45:08.969 --> 02:45:10.389]  And they go, oh no, they're all real mad.
[02:45:11.089 --> 02:45:12.730]  We're going to do the report because you're in it.
[02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:15.871]  Like I care, Chronicle, about being in your rag.
[02:45:16.471 --> 02:45:18.251]  Like I need to be in your toilet paper.
[02:45:19.892 --> 02:45:21.032]  I'm staying out of that one.
[02:45:21.452 --> 02:45:22.893]  I'm just sick of the Chronicle, man.
[02:45:22.953 --> 02:45:24.133]  I'm sick and tired of them.
[02:45:25.094 --> 02:45:27.476]  I'm sick and tired of their hit pieces that are all lies about me.
[02:45:27.496 --> 02:45:29.498]  I just want them to leave me alone.
[02:45:30.319 --> 02:45:31.660]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:45:31.980 --> 02:45:32.801]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:45:32.841 --> 02:45:35.223]  But you guys, so you're going to come though, right?
[02:45:35.483 --> 02:45:36.524]  Unless I'm even sicker.
[02:45:37.005 --> 02:45:37.785]  Oh, you're going to be fine.
[02:45:37.805 --> 02:45:38.106]  Here's the deal.
[02:45:38.126 --> 02:45:39.467]  I had a really bad sore throat yesterday.
[02:45:39.527 --> 02:45:40.688]  I coughed up blood, strep throat.
[02:45:40.708 --> 02:45:41.849]  You're probably going to have it.
[02:45:41.869 --> 02:45:42.029]  I know.
[02:45:42.049 --> 02:45:42.530]  I'm sweating.
[02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:43.611]  You're in the studio.
[02:45:43.631 --> 02:45:45.372]  It's about 100 degrees in here right now, everybody.
[02:45:45.392 --> 02:45:47.274]  It's like a humidity factor of 1,000.
[02:45:48.895 --> 02:45:49.536]  You know why that is?
[02:45:52.964 --> 02:45:53.425]  We're good to go.
[02:46:14.076 --> 02:46:15.016]  Can I tell you a funny story?
[02:46:15.056 --> 02:46:23.560]  We actually, this is terrible, we actually at the movie theater in England, like the picture was real stretched out and it was real out of focus and I kept going, what's wrong with the projectionist?
[02:46:23.620 --> 02:46:25.101]  He turned around and he was cross-eyed.
[02:46:25.121 --> 02:46:26.141]  Kevin, I miss you, man.
[02:46:26.261 --> 02:46:28.882]  We used to take the dogs for long walks.
[02:46:35.836 --> 02:46:36.236]  I don't know.
[02:46:53.138 --> 02:46:53.659]  I don't think so.
[02:47:12.350 --> 02:47:21.763]  They will film it, and then they'll be standing up there at the trailhead, right where, you know, by your car, when you come back up to your car and you go, no, my dog's on the leash, and they go, no he wasn't, you let him off back there, we got a picture of it.
[02:47:21.823 --> 02:47:26.709]  But these illegal aliens that have got seven different IDs, they're allowed to be here, and we give them a pass.
[02:47:26.789 --> 02:47:27.110]  Yeah.
[02:47:27.350 --> 02:47:28.852]  No kids in the car seats, no nothing.
[02:47:28.872 --> 02:47:29.533]  That's you, buddy.
[02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:30.641]  That's crazy.
[02:47:30.681 --> 02:47:31.001]  None of that.
[02:47:31.041 --> 02:47:32.683]  We just drove through the border thing.
[02:47:32.743 --> 02:47:34.745]  I drove in from El Paso yesterday.
[02:47:35.466 --> 02:47:38.109]  And they have this thing where it's like they pull you over.
[02:47:38.149 --> 02:47:39.811]  I guess they're searching for illegal aliens.
[02:47:40.252 --> 02:47:41.413]  And they just flag you through.
[02:47:41.473 --> 02:47:42.374]  It's like the big check.
[02:47:42.434 --> 02:47:44.697]  It's like, here, we're going to stop you for the big search.
[02:47:44.737 --> 02:47:45.858]  And then they just wave you through.
[02:47:45.898 --> 02:47:47.760]  And the whole thing is like, what's the point of that?
[02:47:47.940 --> 02:47:49.142]  And I've been through that one.
[02:47:50.191 --> 02:47:51.672]  I mean, understand, this isn't when you're in Mexico.
[02:47:51.692 --> 02:47:53.052]  This is like 20 miles off the border.
[02:47:53.072 --> 02:47:53.512]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:47:53.812 --> 02:47:59.395]  And we've been, in college, I've been down there with some friends and they go, got some Rohypnol?
[02:47:59.455 --> 02:48:00.775]  Got some cheap whiskey?
[02:48:00.875 --> 02:48:02.116]  Having fun with the girls?
[02:48:02.836 --> 02:48:07.678]  These guys look like total degenerates out of Clockwork Orange hanging in our car.
[02:48:07.698 --> 02:48:09.499]  They go, go have fun with your Robies!
[02:48:10.399 --> 02:48:11.479]  And we weren't into drugs.
[02:48:11.499 --> 02:48:15.401]  You know, we were down there, you know, getting totally plastered in the old days.
[02:48:15.901 --> 02:48:18.282]  But the point is, it was just like a complete joke.
[02:48:19.002 --> 02:48:19.743]  Kevin, final segment.
[02:48:19.763 --> 02:48:21.484]  I want to play this Rockefeller clip when we get back.
[02:48:21.524 --> 02:48:23.365]  And I'm sorry to all the callers.
[02:48:23.405 --> 02:48:24.165]  We're just out of time.
[02:48:24.205 --> 02:48:25.366]  But I'll be back live tomorrow.
[02:48:25.706 --> 02:48:27.307]  Final segment is straight ahead.
[02:48:27.327 --> 02:48:30.669]  And tomorrow, here in Austin, Texas, first 50 people.
[02:48:31.289 --> 02:48:33.291]  You won't give my people more free tickets than that, Kevin?
[02:48:35.432 --> 02:48:36.313]  Frontgate, yeah.
[02:48:36.333 --> 02:48:36.973]  Frontgate.
[02:48:37.013 --> 02:48:38.514]  And also frontgate.com.
[02:48:38.534 --> 02:48:39.855]  Just show up and see what happens.
[02:48:39.895 --> 02:48:41.035]  Frontgate.com?
[02:48:41.075 --> 02:48:42.196]  Yeah, frontgate.com.
[02:48:42.276 --> 02:48:42.997]  That's the website?
[02:48:43.277 --> 02:48:43.517]  Well, no.
[02:48:43.537 --> 02:48:44.718]  That's the ticket website.
[02:48:45.418 --> 02:48:46.719]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.882 --> 02:48:48.923]  A New World Order!
[02:48:49.644 --> 02:48:53.827]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:54.548 --> 02:48:56.330]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:57.370 --> 02:48:59.612]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:00.153 --> 02:49:02.595]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:03.336 --> 02:49:10.682]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:13.661 --> 02:49:18.664]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.124 --> 02:49:22.626]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:22.986 --> 02:49:25.487]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:25.547 --> 02:49:26.688]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:26.708 --> 02:49:27.488]  They're not after money.
[02:49:27.508 --> 02:49:28.569]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:28.769 --> 02:49:29.549]  They're after power.
[02:49:29.770 --> 02:49:30.790]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[02:50:50.282 --> 02:50:54.523]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:50:54.943 --> 02:51:01.785]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:51:02.245 --> 02:51:08.952]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:51:09.272 --> 02:51:10.873]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:51:11.174 --> 02:51:14.357]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:51:14.637 --> 02:51:17.099]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:51:17.399 --> 02:51:24.146]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:51:24.566 --> 02:51:26.287]  Here's the Rockefeller clip from the History Channel.
[02:51:26.307 --> 02:51:26.507]  It was 1956.
[02:51:52.609 --> 02:52:00.212]  America stood at the pinnacle of its prestige, and the Rockefellers were the nation's first family, not only of wealth, but also of power.
[02:52:01.933 --> 02:52:05.535]  If there was an establishment in America in the 50s, it was these Rockefeller brothers.
[02:52:06.475 --> 02:52:13.378]  These young men have taken their place as these absolutely unique members of a unique family.
[02:52:14.085 --> 02:52:24.694]  They're in some sense the very tip of this kind of the American century, the American experience, this optimism that buoys America in the post-war era.
[02:52:25.835 --> 02:52:33.722]  They were in many ways at the center of business life, conservation life, environmental life, political life.
[02:52:34.282 --> 02:52:35.163]  They were in the middle of it.
[02:52:35.203 --> 02:52:37.445]  That's exactly where they wanted to be and they loved it.
[02:52:39.742 --> 02:52:44.123]  Fifty years after Ida Tarbell's scathing attack on John D. Rockefeller Sr.
[02:52:44.343 --> 02:52:49.504]  in McClure's Magazine, Fortune Magazine published a glowing profile of his grandchildren.
[02:52:51.324 --> 02:52:54.465]  Each brother was said to be worth upwards of $100 million.
[02:52:55.725 --> 02:53:01.566]  But more important than their wealth, Fortune argued, was the vast social empire which the brothers commanded.
[02:53:03.506 --> 02:53:08.087]  From their headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, their influence reached into every sphere.
[02:53:09.822 --> 02:53:29.209]  Over the years, through the Rockefeller philanthropic enterprises, charities, support of science, their business enterprises, a web had developed which spread out and was interconnected with practically every center of power in our country and abroad as well.
[02:53:29.489 --> 02:53:34.071]  So this was the real strength and power of the family, going well beyond money alone.
[02:53:34.731 --> 02:53:35.811]  Sometimes they would joke about it.
[02:53:35.851 --> 02:53:37.792]  They'd say, well, David gets Europe,
[02:53:38.507 --> 02:53:49.357]  Nelson is going to have Latin America, and you know, John Dee III gets Asia, and then they make some joke about what Winthrop got, you know, which would be something like Arkansas.
[02:53:50.738 --> 02:53:53.160]  But nonetheless, there was something really behind the joke.
[02:53:54.862 --> 02:53:56.103]  Now that's the History Channel.
[02:53:56.283 --> 02:53:56.743]  You hear that?
[02:53:56.763 --> 02:53:58.965]  The environmental movement, eugenics, everything.
[02:53:59.906 --> 02:54:02.869]  And they're the ones that pioneered giving the public cancer.
[02:54:03.769 --> 02:54:05.130]  Engineering, putting in the vaccines.
[02:54:05.170 --> 02:54:06.091]  And I've got the documents.
[02:54:06.151 --> 02:54:07.512]  Endgame 2 is going to cover all that.
[02:54:08.092 --> 02:54:09.033]  They let me live that long.
[02:54:11.995 --> 02:54:13.937]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:54:14.257 --> 02:54:15.958]  These people are complete psychopaths, Kevin.
[02:54:16.519 --> 02:54:18.220]  Oh, by the way, they engineered the drug war, too.
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:19.261]  You'll find out in the 30s.
[02:54:19.601 --> 02:54:24.185]  They're the ones, we know this, that financed the big movements to quote criminalize drugs.
[02:54:24.225 --> 02:54:26.867]  And then, meanwhile, they control chipping them in.
[02:54:27.507 --> 02:54:30.750]  They were worth billions apiece back then when billions were trillions.
[02:54:31.477 --> 02:54:32.800]  Man, it's amazing.
[02:54:32.881 --> 02:54:33.462]  Nice people.
[02:54:34.725 --> 02:54:35.988]  Well, it's gotta be someone.
[02:54:36.028 --> 02:54:38.032]  I guess if it wasn't them, it'd just be someone else, right?
[02:54:38.714 --> 02:54:39.756]  We gotta find them, Kevin.
[02:54:39.796 --> 02:54:41.160]  No, I don't think we've ever had people this evil.
[02:54:42.051 --> 02:54:43.072]  But hey, you're fighting them!
[02:54:43.452 --> 02:54:45.274]  Yeah, we're definitely fighting them.
[02:54:45.294 --> 02:54:55.823]  It was cool going to England, because before I went to England, I had a bunch of people telling me, like, well, the British are real different, they don't really care that much about all this, but they do.
[02:54:55.883 --> 02:55:01.768]  All the kids in England right now are really, really worried about what's happening with America, because they know they're next, and they know they're part of it.
[02:55:01.908 --> 02:55:03.849]  Same stuff's happening over there.
[02:55:03.909 --> 02:55:08.073]  AmericanDrugWar.com, links up on InfoWars.com, you can watch the trailer.
[02:55:08.413 --> 02:55:08.933]  Sure, I'm going to be.
[02:55:08.953 --> 02:55:10.234]  I hope I'm going to be better tomorrow.
[02:55:32.404 --> 02:55:34.304]  I got so much stuff to do, Kevin.
[02:55:35.445 --> 02:55:37.085]  All right.
[02:55:37.605 --> 02:55:39.106]  Pelican, fly little pelican.
[02:55:39.326 --> 02:55:43.747]  Little pelican, fly pelican.
[02:55:43.787 --> 02:55:44.647]  You're funny, man.
[02:55:46.027 --> 02:55:47.427]  Okay, okay.
[02:55:47.967 --> 02:55:48.828]  We're out of time here.
[02:55:48.848 --> 02:55:50.308]  We need electrolytes, Alex.
[02:55:52.028 --> 02:55:54.709]  What I need is not to work, but I have to work.
[02:55:55.808 --> 02:55:57.169]  I'm not going to be alive forever, Kevin.
[02:55:57.189 --> 02:55:58.229]  I have to fight the New World Order.
[02:55:58.569 --> 02:55:59.510]  Folks, get in game.
