[00:00:05.637 --> 00:00:06.277]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.937 --> 00:00:07.997]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:09.898]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:11.318]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:12.939]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.612]  It is I, the Loose Cannon, careening around on the deck of this Man of War.
[00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:42.398]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.991]  It is Monday, the 12th day of March 2007.
[00:00:48.031 --> 00:01:02.377]  We're coming up on the two-year anniversary of Bush signing the Security and Prosperity Partnership up in Waco, Tejas with Vicente Fox and Paul Martin, the leaders of Canada at the time.
[00:01:03.818 --> 00:01:08.400]  We're also coming up on the four-year anniversary of the kickoff of the war.
[00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:22.361]  And you better believe, though the heavens may fall, the war is going to go on and on and on and on through administration after administration.
[00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:28.266]  Because what's constitutional and what the people want doesn't matter a hill of beans.
[00:01:28.747 --> 00:01:34.632]  The bankers have got us in another Vietnam, and they plan to milk this one as long as they can.
[00:01:35.487 --> 00:01:38.073]  But who knows, we may be able to get the troops taken home.
[00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:43.184]  The globalist arrogance and hubris may implode on them, as they say.
[00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:50.172]  We do have one of the big firefighting organizations coming on scheduled at the end of the second hour.
[00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:53.855]  Talk about the big controversy with Rudolph Giuliani.
[00:01:54.395 --> 00:02:11.730]  How many people know that the police lost a fraction of what the firemen did and the police came in with their firearms and said we're going to bulldoze out all the dead bodies and we're not going to properly get any survivors and the firemen went ahead and just beat the living daylights out of the police.
[00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.832]  The media tried to keep this real quiet.
[00:02:15.212 --> 00:02:17.893]  Giuliani called them evil and sinful and the rest of it.
[00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:21.575]  And now I've been down at Ground Zero.
[00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:31.080]  Again, I'd say about 99% of the firefighters we talked to say it's an inside job or that there's a cover-up and literally my back began to ache from getting slapped on it.
[00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:35.943]  Just absolutely amazing are the things that we witnessed there.
[00:02:35.963 --> 00:02:40.366]  And I'd say about 70% of the cops know it's an inside job, but still 30% are
[00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:45.837]  Turn your camera off, you know, trying to trip you, cussing at you, doing what they do.
[00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:47.638]  Because they're thugs, you know, that 30%.
[00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.300]  But the firemen, I mean, they're all awake.
[00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:55.503]  There was one fireman from New Jersey who gave us an obscene gesture.
[00:02:56.603 --> 00:02:57.284]  But that was it.
[00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:05.809]  I mean, literally, I could hardly do my business, you know, get the interviews and videotape the scene, because the firemen wanted to tell us all about how it was an inside job.
[00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.470]  In uniform, by the way.
[00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:15.076]  It was ground zero in and around 9-11 and it was pretty wild.
[00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:21.177]  So they're coming out against Giuliani saying he's no hero, he's not America's mayor.
[00:03:22.898 --> 00:03:25.638]  Well of course he's not a hero, he was involved in the attacks.
[00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:30.099]  And how long until the firefighters go public on that?
[00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.320]  I'm going to go through an analysis of that on the other side of this break.
[00:03:36.172 --> 00:03:46.854]  Some of the other news, Casual Society by 2012 says Visa Chief, Iranian Defector May Hold Catalyst for War.
[00:03:47.574 --> 00:03:49.555]  This out of the Jerusalem Newswire.
[00:03:49.575 --> 00:03:55.516]  So that's two very important articles we'll be going over.
[00:03:55.956 --> 00:03:58.136]  Next in the stack is the Giuliani Saga.
[00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:02.377]  And then a great article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:12.708]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now, newly unearthed footage exposes 9-11 media scripting.
[00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:17.731]  And this is as big as the Building 7 news.
[00:04:17.872 --> 00:04:19.213]  Will you pick up on it?
[00:04:19.573 --> 00:04:21.074]  Will you make it a big story?
[00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:22.275]  That's up to you.
[00:04:22.335 --> 00:04:25.877]  And it dovetails with all the new Building 7 revelations that have come out.
[00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:29.420]  Bizarre foreknowledge and explanation of towers collapse.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.642]  More cryptic clairvoyance?
[00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:34.883]  On the part of the controlled media.
[00:04:34.943 --> 00:04:35.704]  That's coming up.
[00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:39.005]  Another report here.
[00:04:39.105 --> 00:04:42.207]  Article highlights Churchill's mixed views on Jews.
[00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:48.630]  Scientists threatened for climate change denial.
[00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.911]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:52.792]  Big broadcast.
[00:04:53.252 --> 00:04:54.053]  Straight ahead.
[00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:56.134]  It's Genesis Communications.
[00:04:56.214 --> 00:04:56.754]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.463 --> 00:05:09.907]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:17.892]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.607 --> 00:05:25.671]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:37.477]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.797 --> 00:05:41.259]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.701]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:47.863]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:06.718 --> 00:06:12.161]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:16.484]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:06:16.824 --> 00:06:19.846]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:23.589]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:33.275]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:06:33.535 --> 00:06:37.038]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:06:37.278 --> 00:06:44.383]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:06.872]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:08.853]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.113 --> 00:07:15.415]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:15.695 --> 00:07:21.836]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.077 --> 00:07:23.797]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:07:23.837 --> 00:07:24.197]  I think so.
[00:07:46.676 --> 00:07:48.117]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.577 --> 00:08:16.606]  To say that Mondays are big news days is an understatement, and today is a particularly full news day.
[00:08:17.387 --> 00:08:18.709]  We've only got one guest coming up.
[00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:20.912]  We're about ten minutes in the next hour.
[00:08:20.932 --> 00:08:22.714]  That's one of the big firefighting associations.
[00:08:23.275 --> 00:08:24.176]  Talk about Giuliani.
[00:08:24.196 --> 00:08:27.701]  We're going to have open phones for the balance of this transmission.
[00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:32.220]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.620]  800-259-9231.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:50.946]  Also, if you're just joining us, before I jump into the news, if you wish to support this operation, if you wish to support the work we do, if you think that we're effective against the New World Order, which we are, folks.
[00:08:51.346 --> 00:08:56.728]  We bring in the biggest harvest of awakening minds and souls out there per operation.
[00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:03.849]  I mean, for the size of our organization and what we do, we're having the biggest effect, bar none.
[00:09:03.869 --> 00:09:04.730]  There's no debating it.
[00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.714]  And that's universally accepted out there by people in the know.
[00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:11.958]  Both in and out of government.
[00:09:12.058 --> 00:09:13.679]  Both on the enemy side and our side.
[00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:15.641]  So I hope that you will support us.
[00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:20.064]  And how I ask that you support us is by spreading the word about the radio show.
[00:09:20.524 --> 00:09:24.427]  Telling folks about the free podcast that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:09:24.848 --> 00:09:26.789]  Telling folks about the 24 hour a day streaming.
[00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:29.751]  When the show ends at 2 o'clock, it just restreams continually.
[00:09:30.192 --> 00:09:31.913]  Support our AM and FM affiliates.
[00:09:32.453 --> 00:09:35.235]  If you're a local sponsor in the area, be sure and sponsor them.
[00:09:36.196 --> 00:09:39.959]  And if you're listening on shortwave or satellite, spread the word about those frequencies.
[00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:46.056]  And yes, buy the books and videos that we carry and the 15 films that I've made.
[00:09:46.496 --> 00:09:52.781]  Go to InfoWars.com and peruse the safe, secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[00:09:53.946 --> 00:09:59.991]  And be sure and order those books and videos there, because that's what makes our operation possible.
[00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:05.756]  There's a lot of big things I want to do, but we cannot do those things unless you support us.
[00:10:06.196 --> 00:10:18.807]  And I have several important projects going right now that are extremely resource consuming, and I wish to continue a new project we've launched and expand another project we've been building.
[00:10:19.407 --> 00:10:21.188]  And your support is absolutely vital.
[00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:29.551]  But you get high-quality DVDs, high-quality films, t-shirts, baseball caps, books on tape, shortwave radios.
[00:10:29.771 --> 00:10:31.291]  Everything is about getting the word out.
[00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:34.132]  Everything is about information on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:34.152 --> 00:10:35.373]  So be sure and go peruse the site.
[00:10:35.413 --> 00:10:36.813]  Get America Freedom to Fascism.
[00:10:37.193 --> 00:10:40.554]  At least support my work and Aaron Russo's and get a powerful film to wake others up.
[00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:43.675]  Get Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.256]  Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[00:10:45.276 --> 00:10:46.416]  9-11 Mysteries.
[00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:47.957]  I'm carrying four new videos.
[00:10:49.534 --> 00:10:59.464]  Iraq for sale, and of course we're also carrying 9-11 Press for Truth, 9-11 Unanswered Questions, and American Blackout on the voting machines.
[00:11:00.005 --> 00:11:08.253]  You need to have these films all available again at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139, that number again if you missed it.
[00:11:11.897 --> 00:11:13.858]  888-253-3139.
[00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:16.659]  You can also write to me.
[00:11:16.739 --> 00:11:23.462]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.725]  Okay, let me get into the Giuliani news.
[00:11:29.965 --> 00:11:31.926]  Let's start with this little piece first.
[00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:37.288]  Here's a national news piece, which kind of spins
[00:11:38.443 --> 00:11:40.584]  In a fashion, what's really going on with Giuliani.
[00:11:40.604 --> 00:11:44.206]  So let's go ahead and roll this that broke over the weekend.
[00:11:44.226 --> 00:11:46.466]  Again, we were covering it last Friday.
[00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:49.448]  And then we'll decipher the propaganda here on the other side.
[00:11:49.468 --> 00:11:50.208]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[00:11:50.748 --> 00:11:54.650]  An old dispute is coming back to haunt a leading presidential campaign.
[00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:01.493]  It is a grudge by firefighters dating back to the 9-11 terror attack against former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
[00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:07.055]  CNN's Mary Snow joins us live from New York with a story, obviously a lot of controversy here.
[00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:08.596]  There is, Suzanne.
[00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:12.440]  And that old wound is being exposed by a new rift at issue.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:21.930]  The nation's largest firefighters union is angry that Rudy Giuliani has declined an invitation to attend a forum with presidential candidates from both parties next Wednesday.
[00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:27.135]  Union members vowed to tell what they describe as the real story of Giuliani and 9-11.
[00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:34.014]  Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani sprints as a first responder.
[00:12:34.414 --> 00:12:36.576]  It's a familiar image on the campaign trail.
[00:12:36.936 --> 00:12:41.199]  Giuliani's candidacy has been largely defined by 9-11.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:53.087]  But the International Association of Firefighters is vowing to expose what it describes as Giuliani's offensive and personal attack on firefighters following the September 11th attacks.
[00:12:53.448 --> 00:12:55.349]  For this union,
[00:12:55.979 --> 00:13:02.143]  But more importantly, so many of our members, it's an act that will not be forgiven or forgotten.
[00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:03.564]  It was November of 2001.
[00:13:03.624 --> 00:13:12.570]  Then Mayor Giuliani reduced the number of firefighters allowed to enter the pile at Ground Zero to recover remains, citing safety concerns.
[00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:19.114]  We were given very, very strong advice several weeks ago that this site was a disaster waiting to happen.
[00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:24.738]  Firefighters protested, saying they wanted to continue searching for the remains of their brethren.
[00:13:27.586 --> 00:13:31.388]  When firefighters tried to enter the pile, raw emotions spilled over.
[00:13:32.869 --> 00:13:34.650]  Fifteen firefighters were arrested.
[00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:44.035]  The mayor, I believe, showed disrespect in understanding the importance of allowing us to continue with that recovery.
[00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:52.960]  The IAFF is angry again, this time that Giuliani won't attend the union's upcoming forum, where presidential candidates make their case to members.
[00:13:53.698 --> 00:13:58.685]  Giuliani supporters like retired New York City firefighter Lee Ielpe are coming to his defense.
[00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:02.302]  I hope he lost his son, also a firefighter, on 9-11.
[00:14:02.702 --> 00:14:05.643]  He's now part of the campaign group Firefighters for Rudy.
[00:14:05.903 --> 00:14:13.726]  He accuses the union of partisan politics and points out that the IAFF endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Senator John Kerry in 2004.
[00:14:13.846 --> 00:14:24.789]  It's turned into nothing more than another one of those political venues where they figure they could use their power to sway an election and I think it's really tasteless that they're doing it this way.
[00:14:26.278 --> 00:14:31.005]  Giuliani 8 says Giuliani's schedule prevented him from attending next week's forum.
[00:14:31.366 --> 00:14:38.296]  The head of the group, Firefighters Rudy, responded for the campaign, saying it was honored by the support of so many first responders.
[00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:38.697]  Suzanne?
[00:14:38.717 --> 00:14:41.882]  Do you have a sense of who else is going to be at that forum?
[00:14:42.893 --> 00:14:52.217]  Checking with candidates today, the major Democratic candidates, Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator Barack Obama, former Senator John Edwards, all planning to be there.
[00:14:52.257 --> 00:15:01.682]  On the Republican side, former Governor Mitt Romney is not scheduled to attend, and Senator John McCain's office says that they are trying to work it out.
[00:15:01.702 --> 00:15:01.822]  Okay.
[00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.552]  So, none of this even really matters in the final equation.
[00:15:06.912 --> 00:15:08.613]  These are all bad candidates.
[00:15:09.213 --> 00:15:13.575]  John McCain, Giuliani, Edwards, Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:14.076 --> 00:15:14.776]  It doesn't matter.
[00:15:14.816 --> 00:15:16.037]  They're all New World Order.
[00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:17.638]  It's all fake choices.
[00:15:17.698 --> 00:15:23.161]  It'd be like if somebody spread out in front of you five different colors of cyanide pills.
[00:15:23.321 --> 00:15:28.644]  One was pink, one was blue, one was green, and one was yellow, one was red, one was black.
[00:15:29.724 --> 00:15:30.965]  It's all cyanide pills.
[00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:35.050]  It's all cyanide pills to this country.
[00:15:36.211 --> 00:15:49.058]  Now, what's interesting here is, last Friday, it was reported that the firefighter union did not want Rudolph Giuliani to come, and that he was not invited.
[00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:55.942]  Now, I was digging around for that article, and I did find it this morning, and when I went back to print another copy, it had changed.
[00:15:56.462 --> 00:16:01.985]  The headline had changed, and different publications were reporting that they never actually sent him the letter.
[00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:14.239]  So there's a lot of politics going on here, but basically, Giuliani got word he wasn't invited, and so he's saying he isn't going to come, and now the firefighters, I guess, are changing the tune and saying, okay, well, we just don't want you here.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.101]  Or, now you won't come to our meeting.
[00:16:18.982 --> 00:16:21.344]  Firefighters initially moved to snub Giuliani.
[00:16:22.239 --> 00:16:35.424]  And it says, citing a disgraceful lack of respect for firefighters killed in 9-11 attacks, an influential union initially decided that former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would be the only presidential candidate not invited to the union's upcoming presidential forum.
[00:16:37.225 --> 00:16:39.706]  Now why is this story important?
[00:16:42.027 --> 00:16:43.507]  Why is this report important?
[00:16:45.228 --> 00:16:45.748]  It's simple.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:55.124]  When are the firefighters going to start going public about the fact that they know that 9-11 is an inside job?
[00:16:57.225 --> 00:17:02.608]  Firefighters all over the country have called me, written me letters, sent me pictures of them at their firehouse.
[00:17:02.808 --> 00:17:06.010]  Austin firefighters, I've seen them out on the street at the gun show.
[00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.491]  They're big fans of the truth.
[00:17:08.551 --> 00:17:09.672]  They know what's going on.
[00:17:09.732 --> 00:17:12.393]  They know modern steel buildings don't collapse from jet fuel.
[00:17:12.913 --> 00:17:15.635]  They understand the basic science.
[00:17:16.445 --> 00:17:18.486]  A lot more than the public does, they're firefighters.
[00:17:20.768 --> 00:17:32.876]  And the firefighters were lied to and told the dust wasn't going to hurt them, and then after it came out that it was killing them, we've now learned that the EPA blocked the firefighters and the police getting the aid they needed.
[00:17:34.998 --> 00:17:36.759]  And their lungs are filled with asbestos.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:57.515]  And concrete and mercury and lead and so many other toxic chemicals and compounds and lime that were in those structures because they were pulverized, all three of those buildings, by the explosives with a literal pyroclastic flow like you see from a gaseous explosion when a volcano goes off.
[00:17:58.656 --> 00:18:05.801]  So many tightly packed explosives pulverizing entire floors of those buildings as they fell at free fall speed.
[00:18:07.992 --> 00:18:11.534]  So the question is, will firefighters go public on 9-11?
[00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:22.320]  And the real discussion here, and the real fact is here, I've got about seven or eight articles with different quotes by firefighters and others about why they don't like Giuliani.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:31.185]  And they bring up the dust, they bring up the not being able to get the remains of the other dead firefighters and police.
[00:18:34.438 --> 00:18:38.340]  But frankly, when I talk to firefighters on the ground, they were talking about the dust.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.101]  They were discussing the bombs in the buildings.
[00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:45.283]  They were discussing how there was a countdown for Building 7 to be destroyed.
[00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:49.284]  They were discussing how they were told to get back from the building that it was going to be brought down.
[00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:51.425]  And they're also discussing that on record.
[00:18:53.026 --> 00:18:54.287]  So that's why they're mad.
[00:18:54.667 --> 00:19:01.850]  And so now the media and the union and the leadership is making it about something that happened five and a half years ago concerning
[00:19:03.999 --> 00:19:20.512]  The remains at Ground Zero, which, a few months after 9-11, frankly, nobody was alive, and that place was incredibly dangerous, and there was no way to go in and properly get those remains out.
[00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:27.598]  Now, that said, they did take the remains and dump them at the local landfill, the ashes, the bones.
[00:19:28.499 --> 00:19:29.720]  That should have been gone through.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.745]  And that said, they did haul away the waste under guard to China and South Korea to be melted down.
[00:19:38.847 --> 00:19:42.250]  Under guard, of course, because it showed all the evidence of thermite and explosives.
[00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:47.455]  Alright, when we get back, we'll continue with the Giuliani story.
[00:19:48.015 --> 00:19:54.481]  Then we'll get into the really serious news concerning Iran, the economy, and so much more.
[00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:57.023]  Infowars.net is just one of the websites.
[00:19:57.043 --> 00:19:57.784]  Be sure and check it out.

[00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.070]  Gold.
[00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.691]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.951 --> 00:21:10.034]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:10.234 --> 00:21:14.036]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:14.396 --> 00:21:16.277]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:16.337 --> 00:21:18.618]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:25.842]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:21:25.882 --> 00:21:26.763]  We're good to go.

[00:22:01.767 --> 00:22:04.309]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.809 --> 00:22:09.473]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[00:22:09.813 --> 00:22:16.097]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[00:22:16.117 --> 00:22:19.700]  38% higher than Bill Clinton's highest budget.

[00:23:02.495 --> 00:23:04.557]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:05.178 --> 00:23:14.108]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:21.757]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.472 --> 00:23:27.956]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:51.692]  Alright, so I'm looking at a press release put out March 8th.
[00:24:17.265 --> 00:24:21.387]  That was back on Thursday.
[00:24:25.808 --> 00:24:35.371]  And they say right here that they made the decision to exclude Rudolph Giuliani from the debate, from the discussion.
[00:24:35.411 --> 00:24:45.235]  It says, early on, the IAFF, International Association of Firefighters, made a decision to invite all serious candidates from both political parties except one,
[00:24:45.939 --> 00:24:47.880]  Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:25:11.828]  We made the decision after considerable soul-searching and close consultation with our two New York affiliates, the Uniformed Firefighters Association Local 94 and the Uniformed Fire Officers Association Local 854, as well as our local 94 President and current IAFF First District Vice President covering New York.
[00:25:13.484 --> 00:25:21.886]  And it goes on, the IAFF recognizes that Rudy Giuliani enjoys a favorable reputation as a result of his actions immediately after the tragedy of 9-11.
[00:25:22.306 --> 00:25:28.927]  As such, we want our affiliates and every one of our members to clearly understand the reason and rationale behind this very serious and sober decision.
[00:25:29.788 --> 00:25:35.949]  And they go on to say that he is not America's mayor, and it gets into all of it, folks!
[00:25:37.043 --> 00:25:39.724]  Many people consider Rudy Giuliani America's Mayor.
[00:25:39.965 --> 00:25:41.265]  He just looks like a criminal.
[00:25:41.305 --> 00:25:42.706]  I don't know how anybody could like him.
[00:25:43.366 --> 00:25:48.889]  And many of our members who don't yet know the real story may also have a positive view of him.
[00:25:49.229 --> 00:26:00.375]  This letter is intended to make all of our members aware of the egregious acts Mayor Giuliani committed against our members, our fallen on 9-11, and our New York City Union officers following that horrific day.
[00:26:01.892 --> 00:26:16.216]  So, I've got three separate press releases put out by the main firefighting union saying that they did deliver the letter, they did tell him he wasn't welcome, and by the time it hits national television, Giuliani's snubbing them.
[00:26:16.556 --> 00:26:17.697]  Boy, isn't he powerful.
[00:26:18.017 --> 00:26:19.557]  They're begging him to come.
[00:26:21.338 --> 00:26:22.218]  Just amazing.
[00:26:23.866 --> 00:26:39.834]  Lest assured, our exclusion of Mayor Giuliani is not about any particular contractual or policy issue or disagreement, nor is it based on the unfriendly relationship with our New York City affiliates prior to 9-11, which we will document and explain in an additional correspondence letter during the campaign.
[00:26:40.194 --> 00:26:52.701]  In fact, we invited several candidates with whom we had had substantial disagreement on policy issues because we feel very strongly that our members have a right to hear from all candidates, not just those who toe the IAFF line.
[00:26:55.163 --> 00:26:59.664]  By the way, you hear neocons going, we're for Giuliani, I'm a firefighter.
[00:27:00.505 --> 00:27:01.525]  This is partisan.
[00:27:02.085 --> 00:27:05.006]  Giuliani was pro-abortion, total anti-gun.
[00:27:05.686 --> 00:27:09.527]  He made public jokes about how he wasn't, how he was really a Democrat.
[00:27:10.767 --> 00:27:12.728]  In fact, do you have that abortion clip of him?
[00:27:14.748 --> 00:27:18.710]  Of course, he'll actually probably get 700 Club endorsement with this one.
[00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.611]  If he adds a few gay porn stars into his entourage, it's over, folks.
[00:27:22.971 --> 00:27:23.451]  He will be
[00:27:24.478 --> 00:27:27.420]  Our new leader with the neocon followers out there.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.941]  But here he is.
[00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:33.184]  There must be public funding for abortions for poor women.
[00:27:33.944 --> 00:27:41.709]  We cannot deny any woman the right to make her own decision about abortion because she lacks resources.
[00:27:50.154 --> 00:27:55.922]  I have also stated that I disagree with President Bush's veto last week of public funding for abortion.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:10.422]  There are a lot of good Christian Americans who are anti-abortion who don't like me being sarcastic about that.
[00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.143]  I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:28:12.603 --> 00:28:22.667]  You and I both know, we all know, there are going to be big segments, there already are, of mainstream Christian evangelists and others that are going to say that Giuliani is basically the second coming.
[00:28:23.267 --> 00:28:28.489]  They're already doing it, I've heard it, and they're going to ignore all that because it's a political football.
[00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:30.470]  They don't really care about abortion.
[00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.991]  They want to keep it going as a political football.
[00:28:35.163 --> 00:28:38.067]  But anyways, the firefighters get into all the different reasons.
[00:28:38.207 --> 00:28:49.542]  The dust, the 343 fallen New York firefighting brothers, the disrespect they showed towards them wanting to just bulldoze their bodies, and then dumping them.
[00:28:49.862 --> 00:28:51.404]  Dumping them out there on the landfill.
[00:28:51.665 --> 00:28:53.367]  The bones, there's video of the bones out there.
[00:28:54.329 --> 00:29:07.055]  In November 2001, our members were continuing the painful but necessary task of searching Ground Zero for the remains of our fallen brothers, the thousands of innocent citizens that were killed, because precious few of those who died in the terrorist attacks had been recovered at that point.
[00:29:08.535 --> 00:29:09.856]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:29:10.296 --> 00:29:23.202]  You know, this is really a distraction though, because notice again, they're focusing in on the remains of the firefighters
[00:29:24.298 --> 00:29:30.520]  That's a way to kind of keep control of firefighters, so when you talk to them, they're mad about the dust, and they're mad about the bombs in the buildings.
[00:29:33.041 --> 00:29:37.662]  And they do get into some of that in the health care and the rest of it, and how they have the cops attack them.
[00:29:41.303 --> 00:29:45.105]  And you should go read what this union had to say.
[00:29:45.745 --> 00:29:48.506]  Okay, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:48.566 --> 00:29:48.966]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.656]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:58.263]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.616 --> 00:30:04.297]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:30:04.598 --> 00:30:06.659]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:09.420]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.243]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[00:30:14.343 --> 00:30:14.923]  Here's why.
[00:30:14.943 --> 00:30:21.586]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:30:21.867 --> 00:30:28.330]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.214]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:30:32.434 --> 00:30:36.679]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:44.308]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:30:44.748 --> 00:30:47.149]  Get control, get relief, get some sleep!
[00:30:47.449 --> 00:30:48.450]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.390]  That's www.outand90.com.
[00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.990]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:50.471]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:01.252 --> 00:31:05.833]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:06.234 --> 00:31:09.175]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:09.475 --> 00:31:12.055]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:17.237]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:17.617 --> 00:31:22.979]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:26.240]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.601]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[00:31:29.102 --> 00:31:33.804]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[00:31:34.004 --> 00:31:38.147]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[00:31:38.447 --> 00:31:44.730]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.671]  It says, worship the beast.
[00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:49.573]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:55.302]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:55.322 --> 00:31:55.763]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:32:01.798 --> 00:32:08.282]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:32:08.522 --> 00:32:12.564]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:32:12.804 --> 00:32:14.945]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:32:15.325 --> 00:32:22.289]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:25.251]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:29.034]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:32.236]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:32:32.516 --> 00:32:37.179]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.081]  It's also money back guarantee.
[00:32:39.341 --> 00:32:45.125]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid.
[00:32:45.485 --> 00:32:51.267]  Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[00:32:51.747 --> 00:32:54.028]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[00:32:54.448 --> 00:32:59.830]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:33:15.717 --> 00:33:20.861]  That's not what I wrote on the moon.
[00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:22.582]  It's getting raw.
[00:33:22.622 --> 00:33:31.309]  I can see the day coming when you and your home guys are gonna be in it a lot.
[00:33:31.529 --> 00:33:32.830]  Well, listen now.
[00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:36.233]  The union was made in the USA.
[00:33:36.313 --> 00:33:38.335]  Sure was a good idea.
[00:33:38.875 --> 00:33:42.818]  The country's got in the way.
[00:33:47.632 --> 00:33:49.213]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:49.273 --> 00:33:50.014]  Welcome back.
[00:33:54.556 --> 00:33:55.857]  Oh, here's the best part.
[00:33:56.237 --> 00:34:00.060]  This world is ruled by violence.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.340]  That's right.
[00:34:17.705 --> 00:34:21.987]  Listen to this.
[00:34:22.167 --> 00:34:35.894]  The Council on Foreign Relations came out Friday with a huge white paper called the New New World Order, and they said, oh, globalism's having some problems, but that's because it wasn't implemented right.
[00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:40.636]  Here's the New New World Order of George Bush's glorious plan.
[00:34:42.097 --> 00:34:43.918]  And then here's another one today,
[00:34:45.094 --> 00:34:47.657]  This out of the agency French Press.
[00:34:48.117 --> 00:34:51.160]  Brown wants new world order to fight global warming.
[00:34:52.601 --> 00:34:56.665]  And sure enough it says world government is needed to save the earth.
[00:34:58.227 --> 00:34:59.448]  Does it get any simpler?
[00:35:00.149 --> 00:35:06.235]  But you tell the average good old boy, the average yuppie, the average liberal know-it-all, hey there's a world government run by corporations.
[00:35:06.275 --> 00:35:08.417]  He'll go, that's a lie.
[00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.611]  No.
[00:35:09.951 --> 00:35:11.753]  First off, they'll say it doesn't exist.
[00:35:12.113 --> 00:35:15.016]  Or they'll say, oh, it's loving and good.
[00:35:15.076 --> 00:35:16.037]  We need it.
[00:35:17.459 --> 00:35:18.420]  I went downtown Friday.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:24.286]  The last footage I'm shooting for the film I'm making, kind of as we make the film, we go out and shoot footage as we need it.
[00:35:25.047 --> 00:35:28.150]  And about half the people we talked to didn't even know about the North American Union.
[00:35:29.176 --> 00:35:34.979]  And then the other half, half of them said, yeah, it's horrible world government, nobody cares, you can't stop it.
[00:35:35.499 --> 00:35:40.322]  And the other quarter said, oh yes, I'm all for world government, oh it's so wonderful.
[00:35:40.842 --> 00:35:45.704]  And I said, but it's not elected, it's not free, it's not, it usurps your sovereignty.
[00:35:45.724 --> 00:35:46.745]  And no it doesn't.
[00:35:48.086 --> 00:35:50.307]  And they would all start talking about religion.
[00:35:51.227 --> 00:35:51.968]  It was really weird.
[00:35:52.228 --> 00:35:56.390]  The people who were for world government would say, soon he will be among us in the sky.
[00:35:57.353 --> 00:36:21.416]  And I'm walking around downtown Austin, it was like five people, of the five, I think I discovered some phenomenon yesterday, of like the five who were for world government, they would just suddenly, when you tell them, yeah, but there's no due process, Article 29 and 30 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights says you don't have any rights, and they would just get glazed looks and go, one guy was on a Segway,
[00:36:22.245 --> 00:36:26.210]  With his girlfriend, they give tours and he just goes, It matters not!
[00:36:26.571 --> 00:36:28.113]  Soon Christ will be in the sky!
[00:36:28.373 --> 00:36:29.435]  Our leader will be here!
[00:36:30.111 --> 00:36:32.173]  And I was going, whoa, man!
[00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:36.316]  Not the Jesus of the Bible, though, I don't think.
[00:36:36.776 --> 00:36:37.497]  Somebody else.
[00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:43.601]  The world government's going to be here soon, and He will be in the sky.
[00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:46.583]  I was talking to some other guy, and he goes, it doesn't matter.
[00:36:46.884 --> 00:36:48.465]  Soon the Lord will be with us.
[00:36:48.945 --> 00:36:54.670]  Then I was talking to somebody else, and they go, but have you heard of the such-and-such stones rising of the dead?
[00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:57.191]  I mean, folks, I'm not kidding!
[00:36:57.752 --> 00:37:00.313]  My life is a Twilight Zone episode.
[00:37:02.795 --> 00:37:09.339]  It's just getting weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.601]  But don't worry, the global government will save you.
[00:37:14.662 --> 00:37:17.444]  Brown wants New World Order to fight global warming.
[00:37:17.844 --> 00:37:24.348]  Gordon Brown, likely to be the next Prime Minister, just like the last Bilderberg Group member, Tony Blair, they said likely to be the next Prime Minister.
[00:37:25.037 --> 00:37:34.561]  Gordon Brown likely, because they're all appointed, likely to be the next Prime Minister, will deliver a speech calling for a New World Order to combat global warming on Monday.
[00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:35.282]  Okay.
[00:37:36.302 --> 00:37:43.485]  You have a job, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, I know you're listening, to get that tape for me.
[00:37:43.605 --> 00:37:44.686]  I need that for the new film.
[00:37:45.286 --> 00:37:47.387]  And I know it's going to be on British television.
[00:37:48.447 --> 00:37:48.787]  Okay?
[00:37:48.847 --> 00:37:50.048]  I need somebody to do it.
[00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.691]  One of my crew is on vacation.
[00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:57.392]  That kind of leaves us shorthanded around here.
[00:37:58.273 --> 00:38:07.259]  But, uh, I need this because just showing the article, people that watch my film as I make it will say it's not real.
[00:38:07.319 --> 00:38:09.340]  They say news articles are fake.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:13.102]  And even if I show Brown saying it, a lot of folks will say he didn't say it.
[00:38:13.142 --> 00:38:20.007]  Again, I can have troops, ships landing, thousands of troops disgorging, foreign troops, Americans screaming, don't put me in a camp, and drills.
[00:38:20.347 --> 00:38:21.608]  People see it and they say it's fake.
[00:38:23.988 --> 00:38:25.169]  This is how they operate.
[00:38:26.429 --> 00:38:30.891]  When they take your pension funds and your bank accounts, they've already basically done it with an evaluation.
[00:38:30.911 --> 00:38:33.672]  You're going to tell me that's fake too?
[00:38:33.772 --> 00:38:34.292]  Probably.
[00:38:34.473 --> 00:38:35.333]  I understand.
[00:38:35.973 --> 00:38:40.255]  When a SWAT team busts down your door and drags you off because your kid had a little bit of marijuana.
[00:38:42.756 --> 00:38:45.877]  You're young and basically descends into the criminal justice system forever.
[00:38:45.897 --> 00:38:47.158]  I guess that's made up too, right?
[00:38:47.833 --> 00:38:58.695]  Well, when you give that 18-month-old toddler of yours that's running around talking, having got the sparkle of life in their eyes, you give them that third round of shots and they go into those convulsions and never come back.
[00:38:59.215 --> 00:39:05.397]  Then CPS tries to take your kid on top of it, claiming you shook them when it was the mercury to begin with.
[00:39:05.417 --> 00:39:12.238]  They even see, the Globalists are so smart, they know that you're going to have some of the kids that overcook on the mercury.
[00:39:13.166 --> 00:39:16.889]  And so when they go into their convulsions, you take them back to the hospital.
[00:39:16.929 --> 00:39:18.590]  Sometimes the kids don't even get out of the hospital.
[00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:24.374]  They don't like that because then they can't claim that you shook them because, you know, they've got surveillance cameras.
[00:39:24.654 --> 00:39:27.937]  They like it better when the kid at least gets home and has the convulsion.
[00:39:28.257 --> 00:39:31.359]  And then once you get back, maybe you've got some other kids too.
[00:39:31.379 --> 00:39:32.320]  They'll take those too.
[00:39:33.741 --> 00:39:38.084]  Then the cops will stick lots of little stickers on their cars saying, don't shake a baby.
[00:39:38.857 --> 00:39:40.458]  Yeah, don't shake a baby.
[00:39:41.219 --> 00:39:44.661]  Just shoot them up with mercury and then we're going to say you shook them when you did.
[00:39:45.081 --> 00:39:54.467]  But see, it's the perfect cover story because the dumb cop there with CPS grabbing your kids from you after you did what they said and took the injections, he really believes you shook the baby.
[00:39:54.688 --> 00:39:58.930]  He really believes that sudden infant death syndrome just started overnight out of the blue.
[00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:07.156]  He really believes that shaking babies while all these kids are going into seizures, within hours they're getting their third round of inoculations at 18 months.
[00:40:07.396 --> 00:40:08.797]  And the doctors really believe that.
[00:40:09.998 --> 00:40:16.482]  As long as you give them their cover story, as long as you give them their script that's the official reason, they're busy.
[00:40:17.383 --> 00:40:18.864]  They got a golf game coming up.
[00:40:19.585 --> 00:40:22.046]  They got a girlfriend they're going to pick up and take to the bar.
[00:40:24.408 --> 00:40:26.169]  They got a mistress they're going to go visit.
[00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:30.692]  They got some drugs and whiskey they want to snort up their nose and drink.
[00:40:31.933 --> 00:40:32.914]  So they're not going to care.
[00:40:33.695 --> 00:40:39.378]  And if you tune into somebody like Alex Jones that gets all upset about this stuff, well you know that's just that nut Alex Jones.
[00:40:39.618 --> 00:40:46.062]  He's one of those weirdos that gets upset by millions of autistic children and growing.
[00:40:48.103 --> 00:40:50.184]  He's just one of those weirdos that reads the
[00:40:51.457 --> 00:41:02.999]  He's one of those weirdos that already knew about it in the foreign press, then reads the Chicago Tribune with the Governor of Illinois saying the government in conjunction with DynCorp and Halliburton are running giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.380]  Man, he's a weirdo!
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.520]  Almost every show he mentions that!
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.720]  What's the big deal?
[00:41:08.301 --> 00:41:09.661]  He even gets upset about it!
[00:41:10.341 --> 00:41:14.262]  Who would get upset about big corporations kidnapping children?
[00:41:14.302 --> 00:41:15.062]  It's no big deal.
[00:41:18.835 --> 00:41:20.035]  Alright, back to Giuliani.
[00:41:20.075 --> 00:41:24.117]  That penguin... I like penguinos.
[00:41:24.177 --> 00:41:32.139]  I really shouldn't talk bad about penguins and compare him to penguins, but he just looks like the penguin from Batman.
[00:41:33.879 --> 00:41:34.760]  He acts like it.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.160]  He radiates darkness.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.141]  And then we know all about Giuliani.
[00:41:41.522 --> 00:41:45.943]  Yeah, constantly cheating on his wife and having floozies is the
[00:41:47.265 --> 00:41:51.328]  Doesn't even vector in into what Mr. Giuliani's into.
[00:41:52.389 --> 00:41:58.374]  And all the things he's done, he's anti-gun, he's pro-abortion, he's got Republican Party backing 100%.
[00:41:59.254 --> 00:42:03.518]  And if you say abortion's bad, you're a liberal, huh?
[00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:06.240]  What kind of liberal are you, boy?
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.121]  I like Giuliano.
[00:42:09.282 --> 00:42:11.344]  He's a hero.
[00:42:11.364 --> 00:42:16.988]  Is there a cheesy Pat Benatar song or somebody sung it?
[00:42:17.757 --> 00:42:18.958]  He's a hero!
[00:42:18.998 --> 00:42:20.338]  We need to play that for Juliana.
[00:42:20.378 --> 00:42:21.519]  He's just such a hero.
[00:42:21.959 --> 00:42:25.821]  He couldn't get that smile off his face down there in the pile.
[00:42:26.041 --> 00:42:31.964]  You notice, just by that afternoon, he was out there on the pile.
[00:42:32.024 --> 00:42:33.045]  He'd have his mask on.
[00:42:33.445 --> 00:42:35.306]  You'd see him looking around with all the firefighters.
[00:42:35.326 --> 00:42:36.427]  People didn't have masks on.
[00:42:36.707 --> 00:42:41.469]  And then he'd raise it up and talk on the mic real fast and put it back on real quick.
[00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:43.430]  Because he knew.
[00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.712]  He knew about the asbestos and the mercury and the concrete.
[00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:52.411]  Some of these guys have ounces of that garbage in their lungs.
[00:42:52.712 --> 00:42:53.032]  And what?
[00:42:53.252 --> 00:43:04.775]  About four years ago, major medical institutions had done scans, major universities had done scans of their lungs and they were just fogs.
[00:43:05.195 --> 00:43:07.576]  They were just filled with particulate.
[00:43:08.576 --> 00:43:09.536]  And did they get treatment?
[00:43:09.556 --> 00:43:09.596]  No.
[00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:12.137]  And then we learned the FDA
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:18.021]  Excuse me, EPA, Christina Todd Whitman, knew all about it.
[00:43:19.202 --> 00:43:27.144]  And were ordered by Bush, within a month of the event, to classify the report and to then restate that it was safe.
[00:43:28.245 --> 00:43:31.866]  I've got the newscast, where they're on the news going, it's completely safe.
[00:43:33.946 --> 00:43:35.807]  The air is good for you to breathe.
[00:43:38.764 --> 00:43:41.205]  And, again, you're with Al-Qaeda if you don't agree with it.
[00:43:41.505 --> 00:43:43.705]  Questioning your government is Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:46.826]  I have gotten a bunch of emails.
[00:43:46.866 --> 00:43:48.027]  I've heard Michael Savage say it.
[00:43:48.047 --> 00:43:49.687]  I've heard Sean Hannity say it.
[00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:56.189]  I've heard O'Reilly say that patriots, 9-11 truthers, myself, others need to be put in FEMA camps, be arrested.
[00:43:56.869 --> 00:44:02.871]  It's a mantra now, but I did confirm that Neil Bortz was saying last week that I needed to be put in a FEMA camp.
[00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:04.191]  A concentration camp was his words.
[00:44:05.074 --> 00:44:06.955]  They're not doing that by accident, folks.
[00:44:06.975 --> 00:44:09.996]  They're doing that because they know we're exposing them.
[00:44:10.736 --> 00:44:15.918]  And they're now on air saying, don't you question your government, don't you question the war.
[00:44:15.998 --> 00:44:20.779]  If they say DU is good for you, if they say asbestos is good for you, then you breathe deeply.
[00:44:21.399 --> 00:44:22.440]  And you say, yes, boss.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.481]  Because that's the way this stuff works.
[00:44:30.459 --> 00:44:33.100]  Brown wants a New World Order to fight global warming.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:48.825]  You know, with all our politicians calling for a New World Order, and all these British politicians calling for it, why does the latest in Virginia and Texas and other states, FBI written anti-terror manuals for local police say, believe in New World Order conspiracy theories?
[00:44:50.305 --> 00:44:56.307]  Why did that 2002 issue of Law Enforcement and Technology magazine
[00:44:57.854 --> 00:45:07.496]  Why did it say, if somebody's got an anti-UN sticker, go ahead and arrest them officers, bring them in, they're probably involved in something illegal, and police chiefs support them.
[00:45:07.796 --> 00:45:09.577]  Hell, they're teaching the cops out there!
[00:45:10.017 --> 00:45:12.498]  If you talk about a new world order, you're a terrorist!
[00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:22.320]  And then we don't just have the training, we got cops pulling people over out of their own squad car video going.
[00:45:24.573 --> 00:45:26.314]  They got a pocket constitution here.
[00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:28.596]  Is this illegal?
[00:45:29.177 --> 00:45:29.938]  I don't know.
[00:45:30.018 --> 00:45:33.100]  That may be illegal or he may be allowed to have that.
[00:45:36.003 --> 00:45:40.547]  That may be why she's talking like that.
[00:45:41.228 --> 00:45:42.949]  Maybe she's allowed to have it.
[00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:50.496]  Folks, if I was going to make a Monty Python skit about a police state, I'd have cops pull somebody over
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.023]  And pull out a constitution and start asking if it's legal.
[00:45:55.723 --> 00:46:01.749]  Do you realize that's the mind warp level that we've entered?
[00:46:05.372 --> 00:46:17.323]  Where the people that kidnap women and children and send them to slave camps and make snuff films out of them and send them if they're lucky to sweat shops where they spend out the rest of their life in 12 to 14 hours a day of no air conditioning.
[00:46:19.927 --> 00:46:21.227]  Those are the good guys.
[00:46:21.787 --> 00:46:27.229]  And the bad guys don't want private corporations fully owning our government and looting everything.
[00:46:29.249 --> 00:46:31.710]  The good guy is Jack Bauer who tortures children.
[00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:36.631]  And in the real world, the White House writes memos up saying they can torture children.
[00:46:36.871 --> 00:46:42.692]  And then the White House has little parties on C-SPAN thanking Jack Bauer for changing everybody's mind.
[00:46:43.253 --> 00:46:45.173]  And quote, giving them moral authority.
[00:46:46.337 --> 00:46:47.517]  That's the sick world.
[00:46:47.798 --> 00:47:05.804]  Why, our own propaganda TV show, some washed-up loser actor who couldn't make it in movies, so he goes and plays a Nazi pig on television, that little chicken-neck piece of trash, Kiefer Sutherland.
[00:47:13.641 --> 00:47:19.283]  Because, see, for the average American, that television's real, and they're there fantasizing with him.
[00:47:19.823 --> 00:47:22.904]  You've just become a Jack Bauer.
[00:47:23.624 --> 00:47:34.408]  When Jack Bauer tortures those children, and those women, and those innocent people, you sit there and you bite your lip, and you bare your teeth, and you sit there in your easy chair, and you've now become a psychopath.
[00:47:34.648 --> 00:47:36.929]  You've now been inducted into Satanism.
[00:47:38.009 --> 00:47:39.090]  And you like it.
[00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:40.610]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:43.011]  You're now gonna get to have
[00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:45.515]  The reaping.
[00:47:46.776 --> 00:47:49.297]  You're gonna get to have all the cows come home.
[00:47:50.698 --> 00:47:53.500]  You think it's cutesy-tootsy to be evil?
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.081]  You're attracted by the darkness?
[00:47:56.121 --> 00:47:59.763]  You feel the ice cold and you think it's power?
[00:48:00.704 --> 00:48:03.265]  The weak are attracted to darkness.
[00:48:04.265 --> 00:48:12.690]  The allure of the black uniform, the black mask, the black helmet, the ringwraith, the archetypal Lord Vader.
[00:48:13.729 --> 00:48:15.571]  You want to be one of those?
[00:48:16.031 --> 00:48:24.158]  Well, then you're going to get to be one of those, and you're going to lose large parts of your humanity in the process.
[00:48:25.399 --> 00:48:27.641]  And you're going to lose your vision.
[00:48:28.141 --> 00:48:31.024]  You're going to lose truly being alive.
[00:48:31.584 --> 00:48:33.245]  You're going to be narrowed.
[00:48:33.265 --> 00:48:40.732]  And then all you're going to be able to feel is evil, and so you're going to want to feast on evil so you can just feel again.
[00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:44.931]  That's who you are!
[00:48:46.931 --> 00:48:49.653]  You feed on the weak because you are weak!
[00:48:51.253 --> 00:48:52.814]  You're weak trash!
[00:48:55.895 --> 00:48:57.196]  Alright, Linda, Mike, Victor.
[00:48:57.396 --> 00:48:58.776]  I'm told Victor disagrees.
[00:49:01.417 --> 00:49:02.298]  Many others are holding.
[00:49:02.318 --> 00:49:03.838]  We're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:49:04.839 --> 00:49:06.639]  They're just about to start World War III.
[00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:07.600]  Everything's coming down.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.041]  Halliburton plans to move to Dubai.
[00:49:12.652 --> 00:49:13.793]  All these good ol' boys.
[00:49:14.233 --> 00:49:17.976]  Well at least they're making money for America!
[00:49:19.598 --> 00:49:21.179]  Halliburton to move to Dubai.
[00:49:21.539 --> 00:49:25.622]  That's the Arabs for you good ol' boys that are racist and hate all Arabs.
[00:49:28.144 --> 00:49:30.446]  Cashless Society by 2012 says Visa Chief.
[00:49:30.947 --> 00:49:33.589]  Iranian defector may hold catalyst for war.
[00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:36.851]  Oh yes, catalyst for war.
[00:49:37.752 --> 00:49:39.914]  We're going to go over all that later after I take calls.
[00:49:41.767 --> 00:49:56.958]  I'm going to get to Newly Unearthed Footage Exposes 9-1-1 Media Scripting Bizarre Foreknowledge and Explanation of Towers Collapse More Cryptic Clairvoyance By the way, did I send you this article, John, to download the video clips?
[00:49:59.359 --> 00:50:01.040]  Alright, I'll buzz that up to you in Minnesota.
[00:50:02.401 --> 00:50:03.502]  So you can play that later.
[00:50:03.522 --> 00:50:04.703]  I know we've got a bunch of other clips, too.
[00:50:04.723 --> 00:50:09.066]  I've got some fawning, sickening piece about how we all need implantable chips to keep us safe.
[00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.132]  There's got to be like 15 of these news reports a day, folks.
[00:50:12.213 --> 00:50:12.933]  It's just everywhere.
[00:50:13.414 --> 00:50:14.715]  I mean 15 video reports.
[00:50:15.135 --> 00:50:16.377]  Hundreds of text reports.
[00:50:17.578 --> 00:50:20.481]  See, first they just keep announcing how the chips are there and how good they are.
[00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:30.571]  And then finally, once you get conditioned to just sick of hearing about it, once you start tuning it out, that's when they start going, and you all need it, and we're going to make you take it, and it's going to be great, and you really need it.
[00:50:32.737 --> 00:50:34.458]  All scientifically crafted.
[00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:37.559]  The best psychiatrist and sociologist in the world.

[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.501]  People with 180 IQs to dumb you down.
[00:50:43.861 --> 00:50:46.402]  And they've done a good job of it!
[00:50:48.183 --> 00:50:52.604]  I'm like a fat little chihuahua on the back porch barking at the thunder and the lightning.
[00:50:53.945 --> 00:50:56.505]  Yes, you may get mad at me because I'm a little bit angry.
[00:50:57.246 --> 00:51:00.587]  But I'm doing what I was born to do and that's to raise the alarm!
[00:51:04.503 --> 00:51:09.968]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.328 --> 00:51:17.975]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.658 --> 00:51:25.723]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.104 --> 00:51:37.572]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.852 --> 00:51:41.335]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.795 --> 00:51:43.737]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.077 --> 00:51:47.940]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:08.117 --> 00:54:10.458]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:20.643 --> 00:54:21.784]  Nick, you're in Florida.
[00:54:21.824 --> 00:54:22.244]  Go ahead.
[00:54:22.264 --> 00:54:22.905]  You're on the air.
[00:54:23.945 --> 00:54:24.365]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:24.425 --> 00:54:26.186]  I want to say hi to you.
[00:54:26.246 --> 00:54:27.487]  First of all, I want you to know
[00:54:28.224 --> 00:54:31.605]  Uh, I want to thank you for the education you gave me about government response to terror.
[00:54:32.325 --> 00:54:36.006]  And I want you to know I support you, and I bought many DVDs and other objects from the website.
[00:54:37.026 --> 00:54:39.807]  Also, I made copies of 9-11, Terrorist Storm, and Martial Law.
[00:54:40.447 --> 00:54:45.668]  I sent them to pastors throughout the country, because I believe... You don't have to preface... Hey, listen, you're great, man.
[00:54:46.048 --> 00:54:48.769]  You don't have to preface, you know, that you like me, but you disagree.
[00:54:48.809 --> 00:54:50.329]  Go ahead and tell me what you disagree with.
[00:54:51.002 --> 00:54:55.425]  Okay, well the problem I have is some statements you said on Friday when you mentioned the age of the Earth.
[00:54:55.445 --> 00:55:10.316]  You were talking about global warming, and I know this is not a religious show, and you said in the past that you're not a pastor, but religious statements are made on your show, and I believe some things you said on Friday need a rebuttal.
[00:55:11.677 --> 00:55:14.339]  Well, you said, you know, scientists suggest a younger Earth.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.581]  You called the debate
[00:55:16.963 --> 00:55:18.924]  You know, this is a complex issue.
[00:55:19.044 --> 00:55:21.184]  It's a very complex issue, sir.
[00:55:21.204 --> 00:55:27.846]  There are preachers that say that we're all going to be raptured out before anything bad happens, and so most Christians lay down and do nothing.
[00:55:48.124 --> 00:56:02.295]  And there are preachers who spend all their time debating and arguing with the scientific community, which is exactly what the world wants, instead of saying, look, science proves that there is creation.
[00:56:03.096 --> 00:56:07.880]  And I was saying that science is showing the earth is much younger
[00:56:09.093 --> 00:56:28.616]  Then what scientists were saying just 20-30 years ago, but I was saying that it's a stupid debate between certain branches of Christianity and the scientists that they want Christians to look unscientific, so they want them to have these debates.
[00:56:29.278 --> 00:56:31.560]  But, if you don't understand, I don't expect you to.
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:31.960]  It's fine.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:38.825]  No, I understand what you're saying, but... Look, Christians aren't fighting the slave rings, the open borders, the evil.
[00:56:39.025 --> 00:56:42.608]  They just run around arguing about how old the Earth is all day.
[00:56:43.668 --> 00:56:45.089]  No, I agree with you there.
[00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:50.833]  But, you know, what I'm saying is, you know, there are only two worldviews in the origin of the universe.
[00:56:50.873 --> 00:56:54.536]  It's evolution and creation, and they both can't be right because they're two opposite beliefs.
[00:56:55.817 --> 00:56:56.377]  And when you say,
[00:56:57.506 --> 00:57:04.148]  Christianity versus science, just in that statement right there, you know, you're suggesting that evolution is science and Christianity is not.
[00:57:04.669 --> 00:57:10.011]  When evolution has no facts and it cannot be proven, it's only a belief established by religion.
[00:57:10.051 --> 00:57:15.472]  Well, if you've got me saying the theory of evolution is accurate, please play a tape of that.
[00:57:18.714 --> 00:57:20.214]  No, I don't think I've ever heard you say that.
[00:57:20.674 --> 00:57:22.295]  Yeah, you just said I suggested it.
[00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:27.088]  Well, just by saying Christianity vs. Science, just in that statement right there... Nope!
[00:57:27.228 --> 00:57:30.891]  You see, you just let yourself play into what they're doing.
[00:57:31.431 --> 00:57:33.272]  I'm saying that's how they set it up.
[00:57:34.273 --> 00:57:34.813]  Okay.
[00:57:34.873 --> 00:57:37.274]  Is that they make it like it's two separate things.
[00:57:38.535 --> 00:57:38.775]  Alright.
[00:57:41.737 --> 00:57:44.058]  Okay, well... Look, sir.
[00:57:45.679 --> 00:57:47.360]  They set all this up on purpose.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.201]  I'm saying don't play the game with them.
[00:57:50.462 --> 00:57:51.623]  I do think the debate is
[00:57:52.503 --> 00:58:01.050]  Uh, important, because a lot of people, if they believe, uh, that in evolution, that the Earth is billions of years old and we came from monkeys, well, obviously it's opposite of the Bible.
[00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:04.012]  Why would they want to believe the Bible if that's not proven to them?
[00:58:04.032 --> 00:58:04.753]  That's why I think it's important.
[00:58:04.773 --> 00:58:06.754]  Well, they're not saying we came from monkeys.
[00:58:07.195 --> 00:58:09.096]  They're saying we are simian.
[00:58:10.917 --> 00:58:11.218]  Okay.
[00:58:13.219 --> 00:58:20.625]  And now they just did more DNA sequencing and found out that we are not even close to the chimpanzee.
[00:58:20.665 --> 00:58:21.606]  That was all false.
[00:58:23.605 --> 00:58:26.608]  Our DNA has been altered.
[00:58:26.628 --> 00:58:28.869]  It's been manipulated.
[00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:31.912]  Listen, sir, I appreciate your call.
[00:58:35.114 --> 00:58:38.797]  I don't think you got exactly what I was saying, but maybe I should have rephrased it.
[00:58:39.157 --> 00:58:39.898]  It's my fault.
[00:58:41.319 --> 00:58:45.882]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.875 --> 00:58:58.515]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.175 --> 00:59:00.235]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.955 --> 00:59:02.096]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.716 --> 00:59:03.556]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.276 --> 00:59:05.196]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.856 --> 00:59:09.797]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.037 --> 00:59:14.178]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:19.939]  I've got to do a proper layout on the global warming fraud.
[00:59:22.512 --> 00:59:25.353]  Now they're calling for a one world government to save us from it.
[00:59:25.653 --> 00:59:26.833]  That was the plan all along.
[00:59:26.893 --> 00:59:28.153]  Here it is publicly admitted.
[00:59:28.173 --> 00:59:34.095]  Global tax, global police, environmental laws, total oppression.
[00:59:36.595 --> 00:59:41.396]  So that's coming up and we'll also get into the new Iran developments.
[00:59:41.436 --> 00:59:42.517]  These are very important.
[00:59:42.977 --> 00:59:44.277]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[00:59:44.397 --> 00:59:46.077]  Linda in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[00:59:46.557 --> 00:59:48.918]  Hi, I wanted to talk about Blackwater.
[00:59:49.907 --> 00:59:51.368]  Yes, the mercenary group, sure.
[00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:59.936]  It's kind of funny because I've been listening and I kind of heard you mention it a couple times and I know someone who's been there.
[01:00:01.437 --> 01:00:16.870]  I just woke up and I thought maybe, you know, we could elaborate on some of this stuff because there are people that probably have been there that you might know or somebody like a friend of yours and you might not know that they have been there
[01:00:18.058 --> 01:00:30.989]  And the person I know that has been there knows all about Waco, knows all about the 16th Amendment, knows about Oklahoma City, and not that they have any inside, but you know, they just have a gut feeling, like the rest of us, that something's wrong.
[01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:34.912]  And you know, these people, these people are armed.
[01:00:35.853 --> 01:00:46.742]  You know, they have big guns, they have, they can see you in the woods, through trees, you know, heat signatures, they can see you at night, they can hear you far away.
[01:00:47.506 --> 01:00:53.127]  You know, they have gear that they wear and they can hear you whisper, you know, a quarter of a mile away.
[01:00:54.127 --> 01:00:56.508]  And, you know, we've got to do something.
[01:00:57.408 --> 01:00:58.708]  We really need to do something.
[01:01:00.769 --> 01:01:01.989]  But it sounds like good news.
[01:01:02.009 --> 01:01:04.890]  You're talking to this blackwater operator and they know what's going on.
[01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:10.531]  Well, you know, but changing them is another thing.
[01:01:13.354 --> 01:01:17.195]  I just don't think people realize, you know... Oh wait, so it's even worse.
[01:01:17.235 --> 01:01:20.435]  You're saying this individual knows all about it but doesn't care?
[01:01:21.155 --> 01:01:21.355]  No.
[01:01:21.876 --> 01:01:22.076]  No.
[01:01:22.816 --> 01:01:25.136]  No, you can't change things.
[01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:30.217]  Everybody I talk to and I tell them, they say, well we can't change things, you know, this is the way things are.
[01:01:30.237 --> 01:01:39.539]  Yeah, in fact now that's, instead of most people denying now, most people admit but they say that's the way it is and I might as well have a job and serve it.
[01:01:40.139 --> 01:01:41.959]  And serve the destruction of America.
[01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:56.980]  Well, you know, the thing is that today, you know, like I'm out, it's a beautiful day, and I'm out in the sun shining, it's gorgeous, and you know, short sleeve weather, and I'm not a cloud in the sky, and I'm looking up and I'm thinking, you know, how many satellites are watching me?
[01:01:58.642 --> 01:02:01.284]  And I just don't think people realize how close this is.
[01:02:01.524 --> 01:02:05.667]  You know, you might know somebody who's further involved than what you would like to admit.
[01:02:07.174 --> 01:02:15.660]  And, you know, you gotta think, well, you know, this is my country, and there's a lot of children out there, and there's people, and, you know, we've got to do something.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:22.065]  We've really got to, and, you know, spread the word and stuff, because, you know, it's ugly, and these people are armed.
[01:02:22.225 --> 01:02:23.546]  These people are well-trained.
[01:02:25.287 --> 01:02:27.409]  No, I understand that, and I appreciate your call.
[01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:33.133]  They're gonna shift most of the police into armed security guards with law enforcement powers.
[01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:37.631]  They're going to have Blackwater and other domestic groups running our lives.
[01:02:38.651 --> 01:02:39.572]  And that's the future.
[01:02:40.292 --> 01:02:42.613]  In fact, you read the UN documents from the 60s.
[01:02:44.474 --> 01:02:52.618]  Heavily armed paramilitary police oppressing the population, totally open borders, political crimes.
[01:02:52.658 --> 01:02:55.860]  They're now talking about arresting anyone that criticizes global warming.
[01:02:57.521 --> 01:03:00.042]  We're talking Boston Globe and a bunch of other newspapers.
[01:03:02.144 --> 01:03:04.285]  are saying it's like saying the n-word.
[01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:08.927]  You see, first it's, oh, we'll arrest you in Europe if you say the n-word.
[01:03:08.987 --> 01:03:11.408]  And now, oh, we'll arrest you in the city if you say it.
[01:03:11.448 --> 01:03:14.989]  And, oh, now if you say global warming isn't happening.
[01:03:15.529 --> 01:03:19.350]  And they stigmatize it and they tell you, you're not allowed to talk like that.
[01:03:20.471 --> 01:03:27.553]  And it's because they're a pack of liars and they can't deal with the reality.
[01:03:29.034 --> 01:03:29.834]  They cannot deal
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.220]  With the facts.
[01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:35.522]  And so they can't debate you, so they say, shut up!
[01:03:39.063 --> 01:03:42.204]  We'll be right back on the other side with more of your calls, a ton of news.
[01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:43.864]  We got two hours left here.
[01:03:43.884 --> 01:03:46.125]  We're gonna cover a lot of ground.
[01:03:56.636 --> 01:04:02.123]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.484 --> 01:04:10.094]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.808 --> 01:04:17.871]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:29.696]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:33.938]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:35.899]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.219 --> 01:04:40.081]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.248 --> 01:05:01.511]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:06.113]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:05:06.413 --> 01:05:15.316]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:19.118]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:05:19.438 --> 01:05:24.483]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:05:24.783 --> 01:05:31.470]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:05:31.986 --> 01:05:32.647]  What about you?
[01:05:33.287 --> 01:05:38.632]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:05:53.027 --> 01:05:57.788]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:05:58.028 --> 01:06:02.009]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:08.551]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:06:08.811 --> 01:06:13.172]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[01:06:53.461 --> 01:06:58.524]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.864 --> 01:07:01.186]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.206 --> 01:07:08.931]  Alright, I want to get into
[01:07:10.231 --> 01:07:12.992]  This Iranian general they got to defect.
[01:07:13.693 --> 01:07:23.737]  Shades of the White House memo, they're now hyping it as the pretext for a huge aerial bombardment consisting of thousands of Saudis into Iran.
[01:07:26.518 --> 01:07:38.644]  Also, Mr. Brown, who's going to be the new Prime Minister, according to the Globalist, and I'm sure that'll be the case, they run things, is saying, one world government will stop the death of Earth!
[01:07:39.898 --> 01:07:47.301]  And there's all these other reports, the scientists are saying, billions are going to die, one world government will save us, only one world government will save us.
[01:07:49.462 --> 01:07:52.323]  So we'll go through all that, but let's quickly go through some of your calls right now.
[01:07:52.683 --> 01:07:54.704]  Mike in Texas, you're on the air, thank you for holding.
[01:07:55.404 --> 01:08:09.590]  Yeah, hello Alex, speaking of water, one of my favorite subjects is the water thing, and I was watching a local show here, well not a local, but on Saturday afternoon they show a lot of cooking shows on PBS, and one of them is called Real Simple, it's kind of a Martha Stewart kind of show,
[01:08:10.327 --> 01:08:14.990]  One of the segments was about water, and there were two women talking about it, and the woman was a water expert.
[01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:19.713]  And she was saying, the other interviewer was saying, well, tell us about bottled water.
[01:08:19.733 --> 01:08:23.975]  And she goes, well, one of the problems with bottled water is there's no fluoride in it.
[01:08:23.995 --> 01:08:29.959]  And, you know, if you have children, fluoride is so important for everyone's teeth.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:37.824]  And then she goes on to say, well, you know, tap water is fine, but drink bottled water is okay if you drink bottled water.
[01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:46.733]  I feel like, I feel like I'm underneath the rancid water that comes out of the tap here in Austin.
[01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:52.175]  Well, have you noticed, when you go to the grocery store, it's fluoridated for children!
[01:08:52.816 --> 01:08:55.037]  And they say give it to newborn babies.
[01:08:55.617 --> 01:09:01.600]  Give babies a few months old, because it's just fortified with fluoride and nutrients.
[01:09:03.036 --> 01:09:19.862]  Other nutrients, it's so important for their hypothalamus, their little glands, so important to retired brain development, which all the studies, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, from China and Germany and the University of Texas, I read some study from like 33.
[01:09:21.622 --> 01:09:30.589]  I read the whole study where they said, well, this is an incredible sedative and it causes all these problems and fractures and bones and, you know, we've done a big ten-year study.
[01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:42.438]  And in the Nazis' mainstream history books, the Nazis were using fluoride in the camps at a higher level to sedate the people at the work camps.
[01:09:43.158 --> 01:09:46.200]  And then they're telling us, it's for the children.
[01:09:46.321 --> 01:09:48.762]  Give them the fluoride they need.
[01:09:48.782 --> 01:09:50.844]  And now they know we're trying to dodge it.
[01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:56.011]  And so, they're now going to spray it on the crops as a nutrient.
[01:09:57.072 --> 01:10:06.117]  Oh, yes, and they're going to put it on the foods and they're going to fortify your bread with it because, Mike, the government loves you, okay?
[01:10:08.178 --> 01:10:13.481]  Well, it's one of the major topics, one of my favorite topics, because water is the most important thing on earth, I think, right now.
[01:10:13.701 --> 01:10:16.303]  I mean, it always is, and what's wrong with H2O?
[01:10:16.323 --> 01:10:18.704]  They have to build a better mouse trap.
[01:10:18.744 --> 01:10:21.006]  What's wrong with this dihydrogen monoxide?
[01:10:22.836 --> 01:10:24.057]  Makes me mad, basically.
[01:10:24.077 --> 01:10:29.562]  When I saw this show, I taped it, and maybe I can get you this copy of it.
[01:10:29.602 --> 01:10:29.943]  I hear you.
[01:10:29.963 --> 01:10:30.864]  Your phone's cutting out.
[01:10:30.884 --> 01:10:32.145]  I'm going to let you go, my friend.
[01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.948]  Sounds like an IP phone or a cell phone or something.
[01:10:35.288 --> 01:10:43.716]  Okay, we do have our guest popping in, International Association of Firefighters, Jeff Zack, Press Secretary and Spokesman.
[01:10:44.711 --> 01:10:53.596]  We covered this a lot in the last hour, that the firefighters are mad at Giuliani, and Giuliani called the firefighters evil.
[01:10:54.156 --> 01:10:58.318]  In fact, I have those quotes here in my stack.
[01:10:58.338 --> 01:11:00.259]  Let me just grab it out here before we go to our guest.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:05.402]  Mayor Giuliani launched a savage attack on the firemen, saying their actions were sinful.
[01:11:05.983 --> 01:11:08.784]  They have absolutely no monopoly in caring about the people there.
[01:11:09.544 --> 01:11:12.126]  And it goes on to report, this was the Associated Press,
[01:11:13.041 --> 01:11:14.603]  Uh, first off, I have the press release put out
[01:11:34.384 --> 01:11:41.271]  Well, that part was a complicated story where we had a pretty intense internal discussion between our New York City firefighters and our national office.
[01:11:59.286 --> 01:12:04.969]  to decide whether we should invite Rudy Giuliani to a presidential forum we're holding in Washington D.C.
[01:12:04.989 --> 01:12:09.932]  where we have the major candidates from both parties coming to speak to firefighters from around the country.
[01:12:10.513 --> 01:12:19.538]  And the initial decision among those talking about the issue from New York City and from the national office was we shouldn't invite Rudy Giuliani because of
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:30.463]  The egregious way that he treated our fallen and those attempting to pursue a dignified recovery of the citizens and firefighters who lost their lives that horrific day.
[01:12:31.244 --> 01:12:40.366]  And in making that decision, a discussion ensued about, well, how are we going to communicate to our membership that we're not inviting Rudy?
[01:12:40.406 --> 01:12:43.647]  Because he would be the only person who wasn't invited.
[01:12:43.807 --> 01:12:48.589]  Every other major candidate was invited from the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.
[01:12:49.413 --> 01:12:59.039]  So we drafted a letter to let people know of exactly the circumstances that were discussed and why Rudy didn't deserve an invitation.
[01:13:00.699 --> 01:13:17.889]  Before that was a final decision, another discussion ensued where we thought, you know, we're holding this forum for all candidates, all the major candidates, and we don't have any limitation on who we're inviting in terms of whether we agree with them on all their policy issues or we don't.
[01:13:18.713 --> 01:13:20.755]  There are other candidates who are appearing.
[01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:22.617]  And so he did get invited?
[01:13:22.637 --> 01:13:23.878]  He did get invited.
[01:13:23.898 --> 01:13:25.419]  Long story short, he did get invited.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:33.186]  Confirmed his appearance last Monday, then had his representative call us back on Wednesday and cancel.
[01:13:34.147 --> 01:13:41.734]  Okay, now since I've got you on here, I've been to Ground Zero for several memorials, been in New York quite a few times, separate from those visits.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:50.263]  And every firefighter I talked to just cannot stand Giuliani, but not over the cops, you know, trying to kick you guys off and that.
[01:13:50.283 --> 01:13:51.963]  I mean, that was kind of how it started.
[01:13:52.483 --> 01:14:01.607]  But saying the dust wasn't a problem, which we now know it was, and also taking the remains and dumping them in the landfill unceremoniously.
[01:14:01.627 --> 01:14:05.168]  I mean, aren't those some of the issues firefighters are also mad about?
[01:14:05.788 --> 01:14:06.608]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:07.128 --> 01:14:08.349]  There were a number of issues.
[01:14:08.846 --> 01:14:09.526]  We're good to go.
[01:14:27.353 --> 01:14:36.963]  And he went to a full, what we call, scoop and dump, where he was just taking all what he determined was trash, putting it on a barge, and sending it to Fresh Kills Landfill.
[01:14:37.244 --> 01:14:46.674]  Well that, what he called trash, contained the remains of thousands of citizens, hundreds of firefighters, and we felt that all of those people deserved some sort of
[01:14:47.322 --> 01:14:55.730]  The families of those people deserve some sort of closure and some sort of dignified recovery process because they were innocent victims.
[01:14:56.111 --> 01:15:07.702]  Well to me, I mean I agree, to me, and again we're talking to Jeff Zack, Press Secretary for the biggest association of firefighters in the U.S., International Association of Firefighters, with what, 230-something thousand members?
[01:15:07.722 --> 01:15:08.162]  280 in the U.S.
[01:15:08.222 --> 01:15:08.622]  and Canada.
[01:15:08.843 --> 01:15:09.023]  Oh, 280, okay.
[01:15:13.268 --> 01:15:15.230]  Well, then I guess that's 230 in the U.S.
[01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:16.071]  That's how I got that number?
[01:15:16.091 --> 01:15:16.611]  Approximately, yes.
[01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:18.532]  Okay, that's because the AP said 230.
[01:15:18.853 --> 01:15:21.975]  So I guess you have another 50,000 members in Canada, then?
[01:15:22.175 --> 01:15:23.136]  That'd be about right, yeah.
[01:15:23.376 --> 01:15:23.676]  Okay.
[01:15:24.817 --> 01:15:28.600]  I mean, to me, I could see Giuliani saying, look, this is really dangerous.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:32.103]  We've got to get some of the rescue workers out of here.
[01:15:32.483 --> 01:15:41.470]  But what really can't be debated is they took, and I've seen the video of the bones and body parts, and dump it out in a landfill.
[01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:42.010]  Right.
[01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:57.734]  Well, you know, for him to determine that it was unsafe, you know, okay, this actually was probably the most unstable, unsafe destruction area in the history of the United States.
[01:15:58.675 --> 01:16:07.497]  But for Rudy Giuliani to all of a sudden become concerned six weeks after the initial accident, where hundreds and thousands of people had been
[01:16:07.984 --> 01:16:08.244]  I think so.
[01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:24.532]  The bank in Nova Scotia's assets were buried in that rubble.
[01:16:24.892 --> 01:16:34.696]  The day they got those assets out of that pile, Rudy shut the pile down, said everybody off, we're going to full scoop and dump, we're going to put the building back up.
[01:16:34.716 --> 01:16:36.417]  Now how much gold was really in there?
[01:16:36.457 --> 01:16:37.537]  Because we've seen different numbers.
[01:16:38.638 --> 01:16:42.079]  You know, it was gold, it was silver, it was other assets.
[01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:44.174]  I've seen a lot of numbers too.
[01:16:44.254 --> 01:16:46.616]  I don't have an exact one so I don't want to give it to you.
[01:16:46.776 --> 01:16:49.439]  Well how much gold did you or did your comrades see?
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.484]  Our firefighters were on the pile helping excavate the gold as well.
[01:16:55.556 --> 01:17:07.041]  Our problem is that all Rudy cared about, though, at the end of the day, what he proved is all he cared about was the gold bricks, not the lives and the memory of those who were there.
[01:17:07.141 --> 01:17:10.443]  So as soon as that bank said, we've got the gold, he said, that's it?
[01:17:10.803 --> 01:17:16.025]  He pulled off the security guards, the army trucks pulled out, the armored trucks pulled out, and he said, everybody off the pile.
[01:17:16.485 --> 01:17:23.188]  We're going to start bringing in the heavy mining equipment, and we're going to start scooping up piles of this, putting it on barges, and taking it to the trash heap.
[01:17:23.288 --> 01:17:23.829]  Unbelievable!
[01:17:23.869 --> 01:17:25.149]  Now, what about the dust?
[01:17:25.209 --> 01:17:39.136]  I mean, as bad as that is, not letting you get your fallen heroes, but knowing the dust was deadly, asbestos, concrete, mercury, and then not giving proper treatment, and then, I mean, that's incredible.
[01:17:39.376 --> 01:17:44.939]  Well, that's a whole other issue, the extreme denial in which not only
[01:17:45.701 --> 01:17:51.619]  Uh, the federal government was, but the city of New York in cooperation with the federal government about whether, how
[01:17:52.566 --> 01:18:01.189]  How dangerous it really was to be on that pile, not just working on the unsettled situation, but breathing that air full of the toxic particles that we now know it was full of.
[01:18:01.249 --> 01:18:02.209]  And then the cover-up!
[01:18:02.249 --> 01:18:08.951]  I mean, and then he's got the nerve to say he's a hero, because he went out there day one with a mask and got on a bullhorn!
[01:18:09.332 --> 01:18:11.312]  I mean, is really Giuliani a hero?
[01:18:11.552 --> 01:18:19.735]  You should really be skeptical about someone who calls themselves a hero, who spends millions and millions of dollars after the fact
[01:18:20.548 --> 01:18:33.993]  Building up an image as an American hero, America's mayor, when in fact if you go back and look at what really happened that day and what the real heroes of that day, the firefighters and the innocent victims and the families of them, really think of Rudy Giuliani.
[01:18:34.253 --> 01:18:35.814]  That's the true measure of who Rudy is.
[01:18:35.834 --> 01:18:40.276]  Jeff, I know you're really busy, but can you stay through one break and do five more minutes with us on the other side?
[01:18:40.456 --> 01:18:40.596]  Yes.
[01:18:40.896 --> 01:18:52.282]  Right, because I want to hear specifically, you know, because you're the spokesman, you know all these people, what really happened so we can understand how he built this image of himself up and how that's starting to collapse.
[01:18:54.662 --> 01:18:55.643]  Good morning, honey!
[01:18:56.003 --> 01:18:56.543]  Wow!
[01:18:56.724 --> 01:19:02.008]  The weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[01:19:02.288 --> 01:19:04.690]  Yeah... Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:08.452]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[01:19:08.913 --> 01:19:10.414]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:19:10.854 --> 01:19:12.575]  And what am I gonna do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:19:12.956 --> 01:19:14.737]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:19:14.937 --> 01:19:15.778]  Honey, cheer up!
[01:19:16.198 --> 01:19:18.461]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:19.041]  What?
[01:19:19.462 --> 01:19:29.953]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:19:30.234 --> 01:19:35.079]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?

[01:19:42.564 --> 01:19:43.424]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:43.444 --> 01:19:44.285]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:20:00.623 --> 01:20:05.447]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:08.409]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:08.449 --> 01:20:09.530]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:15.494]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:16.415 --> 01:20:23.700]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:24.681 --> 01:20:27.743]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:29.873 --> 01:20:33.336]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:20:45.548 --> 01:20:45.729]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.749 --> 01:20:46.049]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.143 --> 01:20:56.606]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.427 --> 01:21:06.436]  Did you know that the Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[01:21:07.176 --> 01:21:12.662]  From the rubbles of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation chapter 13.
[01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:24.113]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[01:21:24.894 --> 01:21:32.041]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:56.386]  Does this sound bring on a sudden onset of fear?
[01:21:56.846 --> 01:21:58.768]  A fear of not knowing who's on the other end?
[01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:03.512]  Do you avoid picking up the phone knowing it's just going to be another harassing phone call from a debt collector?
[01:22:03.672 --> 01:22:08.136]  Do you resent your daily trips to the mailbox knowing it will be flooded with notices from creditors?
[01:22:08.436 --> 01:22:11.398]  Over 1 million credit card holders will declare bankruptcy this year.

[01:22:15.342 --> 01:22:15.642]  That's 920-293-8024.
[01:22:23.032 --> 01:22:25.494]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:22:25.975 --> 01:22:27.876]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:22:28.597 --> 01:22:31.779]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:38.905]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:22:39.666 --> 01:22:41.867]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:22:42.248 --> 01:22:42.688]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:42.748 --> 01:22:44.169]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:56.323 --> 01:22:58.945]  Whatever you say about 9-11, there's one thing everybody agrees on.
[01:22:58.965 --> 01:23:00.666]  Those firefighters were heroes.
[01:23:00.807 --> 01:23:03.389]  And what happened to the police was terrible too, but a fraction
[01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:27.890]  A fraction as many police were lost as firefighters.
[01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:29.930]  And Giuliani's always been after the firefighters.
[01:23:31.050 --> 01:23:33.251]  And he's always had problems with them.
[01:23:33.411 --> 01:23:43.493]  And the bizarre statements calling them evil and sinful for wanting to, you know, get their dead friends out of there and to search for any survivors.
[01:23:45.173 --> 01:23:48.674]  And then to dump their remains in a landfill in a garbage pit.
[01:23:49.534 --> 01:23:50.715]  Folks, we've got the video of it.
[01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:51.595]  Bones and stuff.
[01:23:51.655 --> 01:23:52.795]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:23:54.381 --> 01:23:56.802]  And send the cops in and start beating the firemen up.
[01:23:56.862 --> 01:24:03.023]  And I'm not trying to cause a fighter between New York firefighters and police, but everybody knows there's a rivalry going back a long time.
[01:24:04.644 --> 01:24:07.925]  Giuliani, you know, for the average American, they really believe he's this hero.
[01:24:09.665 --> 01:24:11.566]  How did he build this image up of himself?
[01:24:11.606 --> 01:24:13.186]  We're talking to Jeff Zaks.
[01:24:14.086 --> 01:24:19.388]  Jeff Zaks is the Press Secretary and Spokesperson for the International Association of Firefighters with 280 plus thousand members.
[01:24:25.246 --> 01:24:28.049]  Jeff, tell us how Giuliani built this image of himself up.
[01:24:28.509 --> 01:24:45.986]  Well, ever since 9-11 and he was no longer mayor at the end of the year, he started Rudy Giuliani LLC, which is essentially a holding corporation where he started generating hundreds of thousands, tens of thousands of speech.
[01:24:46.699 --> 01:25:02.300]  uh... in in speakers fees going around the country building himself as america's mayor talking about nine eleven rudy giuliani has made millions and millions of dollars off of nine eleven and the story he likes to tell about nine eleven and he's used to those millions of dollars
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:13.747]  And those speeches around the country to build up this image that he was a hero that day and in the days following and as far as the firefighters from New York are concerned, he's anything but a hero.
[01:25:33.181 --> 01:25:44.332]  Well, there was a whole lot of discussion, including the Environmental Protection Administration, which said, hey, the air there is not a problem.
[01:25:44.392 --> 01:25:50.438]  New York City and Rudy Giuliani's administration agreed with that assessment and continued to
[01:25:51.835 --> 01:25:52.335]  I don't
[01:26:13.072 --> 01:26:19.437]  That story, his onion, will continue to be peeled and America will really learn the true character of who Rudy Giuliani really is.
[01:26:19.697 --> 01:26:23.721]  In closing, he's trying to say that you guys just hate him because he's a Republican.
[01:26:24.181 --> 01:26:25.482]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:28.705]  We are a union and unions traditionally are known for giving the Democrats
[01:26:29.045 --> 01:26:30.345]  But firefighters are different.
[01:26:30.665 --> 01:26:35.347]  We give 30% of our political PAC money to Republicans.
[01:26:35.387 --> 01:26:40.868]  We supported your own governor in Texas, Rick Perry, in the last election, Charlie Crist in Florida.
[01:26:41.909 --> 01:26:50.471]  When George Bush was running for president and his brother was running for governor of Florida, we were against George Bush for president but for his brother as governor of Florida.
[01:26:51.191 --> 01:26:57.475]  We've been with John McCain, we've been with Duncan Hunter, so it's disingenuous to say this is a partisan politic.
[01:26:57.495 --> 01:27:09.221]  In fact, you're inviting all the big Republicans, and some of them are coming, so it's not like... We have all the major candidates from both sides, minus Rudy Giuliani, at a presidential forum where the main people will be here.
[01:27:09.262 --> 01:27:11.663]  We'll have Barack Obama, but we'll have John McCain.
[01:27:12.103 --> 01:27:14.664]  We're going to have Chuck Hagel, and we're going to have Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:14.924 --> 01:27:18.086]  We're going to have Duncan Hunter, and we're going to have John Edwards.
[01:27:18.126 --> 01:27:24.048]  So we have all the major candidates here, except for Rudy from both sides of the political aisle, and that's the nature of politics.
[01:27:24.068 --> 01:27:32.271]  Well, I think when the word gets out that he's not a hero, and that he actually covered up the truth of what happened there with the dust and the rest of it, that people are going to turn and run from him.
[01:27:32.492 --> 01:27:33.952]  Well, there's a lot more story to tell.
[01:27:34.212 --> 01:27:35.773]  There are a lot of weeks until the vote.
[01:27:36.273 --> 01:27:39.674]  And we rest assured that we will continue to tell Rudy's story.
[01:27:40.055 --> 01:27:42.756]  In 60 seconds, tell us more about the story.
[01:27:43.516 --> 01:27:55.421]  Well, for us in this initial decision, which is why it really became a story recently, this was all surrounding our presidential forum and why we may or may not want to have him.
[01:27:55.461 --> 01:27:56.581]  We ultimately invited him.
[01:27:59.549 --> 01:28:19.169]  The initial discussion internally, the real visceral reaction of the firefighters in New York to Rudy Giuliani is centered around his treatment of the fallen after the devastating attack on New York City and the way he went from allowing us to recover our own to flipping that decision because the gold had been recovered.
[01:28:19.410 --> 01:28:21.552]  Did they do that within one day of recovering the gold?
[01:28:22.853 --> 01:28:25.454]  Literally, he took people off the pile the next day.
[01:28:25.994 --> 01:28:26.254]  Wow.
[01:28:26.655 --> 01:28:30.417]  Listen, as this develops, I'd like to be able to have you back up for a quick report.
[01:28:30.757 --> 01:28:32.298]  Jeff Zack, thank you for joining us.
[01:28:32.558 --> 01:28:33.438]  No problem, thank you.
[01:28:33.699 --> 01:28:33.999]  You bet.
[01:28:34.039 --> 01:28:36.180]  Jeff Zack, International Association of Firefighters.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.481]  We'll be right back, straight to your calls and the other news.
[01:28:38.801 --> 01:28:39.342]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.964 --> 01:28:44.885]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.345 --> 01:28:46.946]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.866 --> 01:28:50.548]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:54.275]  Hey, Emily.
[01:28:54.615 --> 01:28:55.395]  Wow, you look great!
[01:28:55.695 --> 01:28:56.436]  I feel great.
[01:28:56.896 --> 01:28:58.516]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:28:59.076 --> 01:28:59.356]  Really?
[01:28:59.616 --> 01:29:00.056]  What is it?
[01:29:00.236 --> 01:29:00.657]  How does it work?
[01:29:00.937 --> 01:29:07.218]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and fentanyl clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[01:29:07.538 --> 01:29:09.599]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:29:09.999 --> 01:29:15.460]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:16.080]  That's it?
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.981]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:29:18.321 --> 01:29:18.981]  It is easy.
[01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:25.744]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:29:25.984 --> 01:29:27.345]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:29:27.765 --> 01:29:28.406]  That's amazing!
[01:29:28.766 --> 01:29:33.608]  And, the bentonite clay and medicalins eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:29:34.048 --> 01:29:34.348]  Wow!
[01:29:34.628 --> 01:29:35.629]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:29:35.869 --> 01:29:38.630]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:29:38.690 --> 01:29:42.352]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[01:29:42.592 --> 01:29:44.293]  For only $26.90, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[01:29:44.533 --> 01:29:44.893]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[01:29:44.913 --> 01:29:45.113]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:29:45.153 --> 01:29:48.975]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:29:48.995 --> 01:29:50.035]  Globalists are concerned
[01:30:07.346 --> 01:30:07.586]  We're good.
[01:30:25.458 --> 01:30:25.958]  I think so.
[01:30:53.466 --> 01:31:00.136]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror!
[01:31:04.005 --> 01:31:07.168]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[01:31:07.408 --> 01:31:11.071]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[01:31:11.351 --> 01:31:19.298]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.
[01:31:19.699 --> 01:31:25.984]  Get two Witness Ministries' next shocking revelation, The Rider of the White Horse, George W. Bush in Prophecy.
[01:31:26.284 --> 01:31:27.005]  Visit the website
[01:31:27.005 --> 01:31:27.745]  We're good to go.
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:10.502]  We're good to go.
[01:32:33.015 --> 01:32:34.696]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:34.717 --> 01:32:38.319]  I'm glad that you joined us today.
[01:32:38.339 --> 01:32:45.425]  You look at the earth, you look at the old buildings, you look at historical items, and you get this feeling of nostalgia.
[01:32:46.126 --> 01:32:49.148]  Even though you never lived then, it's nostalgia for those you never met.
[01:32:49.168 --> 01:32:59.177]  And it's nostalgia for your own life that will, soon enough, evaporate like dew on the petals of a flower in the morning.
[01:32:59.717 --> 01:33:01.819]  Like dust blown away from a doorway.
[01:33:02.998 --> 01:33:05.859]  That's why you feel nostalgic when you see old things.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:07.960]  Because don't lie to yourselves.
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:10.462]  Your life will go by very, very quickly.
[01:33:10.842 --> 01:33:12.403]  So live it to the fullest.
[01:33:12.883 --> 01:33:13.583]  Live it well.
[01:33:13.663 --> 01:33:14.504]  Be a good person.
[01:33:14.564 --> 01:33:15.184]  Help others.
[01:33:15.824 --> 01:33:19.166]  And leave good things behind and you will be remembered.
[01:33:20.166 --> 01:33:26.149]  Or you'll be one of these greedy, arrogant, self-centered nobodies who no one will remember and who no one will care about.
[01:33:27.049 --> 01:33:28.930]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Tennessee.
[01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:29.811]  You're on the air, Mark.
[01:33:29.851 --> 01:33:30.231]  Go ahead.
[01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:31.652]  Hello?
[01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:34.091]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:33:34.912 --> 01:33:35.752]  I'm doing pretty good.
[01:33:37.053 --> 01:33:40.254]  I just wanted to share a few verses from Scripture if I could.
[01:33:40.314 --> 01:33:40.574]  Sure.
[01:33:42.014 --> 01:33:46.476]  I think it's very relevant to what you've been talking about as of late in terms of the eugenics.
[01:33:47.877 --> 01:33:50.058]  It's in Luke's Gospel, Chapter 23.
[01:33:50.098 --> 01:33:54.059]  It's where basically Jesus is being led to the cross.
[01:33:54.399 --> 01:33:54.879]  Luke 23, okay.
[01:33:56.977 --> 01:34:05.300]  And starting in verse 28, Jesus turned unto them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:14.303]  For behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bear, and the paps which never gave suck.
[01:34:15.123 --> 01:34:18.804]  Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, cover us.
[01:34:19.624 --> 01:34:22.866]  For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
[01:34:24.815 --> 01:34:37.583]  Here, basically, I think what Jesus is saying is there's going to come a time in the future where, you know, the likes of the Piancas and the Ted Turners, they're going to be given audience.
[01:34:37.603 --> 01:34:46.028]  And even in some cases, standing ovations for, you know, calling out for the death of people.
[01:34:46.369 --> 01:34:48.830]  Well, they're already getting standing ovations.
[01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:49.911]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:51.023 --> 01:34:53.284]  Well, you're talking about children of men here.
[01:34:53.324 --> 01:34:58.127]  You're talking about their plan for total sterilization, and they're carrying it out right now.
[01:34:58.687 --> 01:35:01.449]  Sperm counts dropped over 80 plus percent in the western world.
[01:35:01.869 --> 01:35:03.390]  Every other indicator shows them.
[01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:07.191]  I mean, we are being engineered downward right now.
[01:35:08.072 --> 01:35:09.573]  Right, right, exactly.
[01:35:09.593 --> 01:35:16.456]  In that last verse, verse 31, where he says, for if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
[01:35:16.496 --> 01:35:18.077]  Well, I just think that he's saying that
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:28.003]  You know, there's going to come a time where if they don't honor God and honor life, which is what God is about, they'll do the complete opposite, which is to honor death.
[01:35:28.704 --> 01:35:29.584]  Well, they love death!
[01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:34.406]  Yeah, that's why they're called the Order of Death, the Skull and Bones, the symbolism.
[01:35:35.366 --> 01:35:37.107]  And anyways, I just wanted to share that with you.
[01:35:37.127 --> 01:35:38.808]  Alex, I don't know if you had read that before.
[01:35:38.828 --> 01:35:45.050]  I was listening to you last week talking about the eugenics and how you're going to make, and your new film is about that.
[01:35:45.951 --> 01:35:50.474]  And I was just reading from Luke's Gospel last week and it just jumped out of the pages literally.
[01:35:50.494 --> 01:35:52.596]  Well it's funny, we're actually going to have a quote in the film.
[01:35:52.656 --> 01:35:55.078]  I forget the passage where it says they loved death.
[01:35:55.898 --> 01:35:57.920]  You know, they loved all the things of their father.
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:01.662]  Yeah, even if you don't believe in Jesus, you don't believe in God.
[01:36:01.883 --> 01:36:06.306]  Even if you're a moral person, you know, it's just moral.
[01:36:06.806 --> 01:36:08.768]  It's good morals and just good common sense.
[01:36:10.185 --> 01:36:11.405]  To promote life, that would be better.
[01:36:11.425 --> 01:36:13.026]  But we have new morals.
[01:36:13.366 --> 01:36:16.007]  We must kill humans for the Earth.
[01:36:16.507 --> 01:36:21.489]  No, that's an excuse the elite are creating to push their worldwide police state.
[01:36:21.889 --> 01:36:22.850]  I appreciate your call.
[01:36:22.890 --> 01:36:23.830]  Good points, Mark.
[01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:26.451]  Eric in Australia, welcome.
[01:36:27.392 --> 01:36:27.992]  Alex Hager.
[01:36:28.192 --> 01:36:28.432]  Good.
[01:36:29.246 --> 01:36:29.947]  Good, excellent.
[01:36:29.967 --> 01:36:32.749]  Look, I've got one comment and two questions for you.
[01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:40.794]  Did you see the other day, I was chatting to someone on the internet, someone from China, and I got called a Tiananmen Square conspiracy theorist.
[01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:45.898]  And it was amazing, this girl, I showed her pictures of the massacre.
[01:36:45.918 --> 01:36:48.800]  Yeah, she was saying it didn't happen, just like 9-1-1 didn't have him.
[01:36:49.301 --> 01:36:50.381]  That's right, it didn't happen.
[01:36:50.742 --> 01:36:52.363]  I made up the pictures, it's all fake.
[01:36:52.816 --> 01:36:57.038]  And I was thinking, how relevant is it to today's society and our 9-11?
[01:36:57.118 --> 01:37:00.339]  There'll be people like this in the future sometime, probably.
[01:37:00.359 --> 01:37:01.460]  It's going to be disgraceful.
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.421]  Oh, they'll do whatever they're told!
[01:37:03.561 --> 01:37:14.586]  I mean, I have heard of movements in China where they claim none of that really happened, and so you were chatting with someone that said there isn't video of tanks running over people, there isn't video of police shooting people.
[01:37:15.426 --> 01:37:18.287]  I mean, look, our media doesn't show the really hardcore stuff.
[01:37:18.387 --> 01:37:20.608]  I've seen the raw Tiananmen Square footage.
[01:37:21.309 --> 01:37:22.309]  I mean, it is grisly.
[01:37:23.533 --> 01:37:24.434]  Yeah, I know.
[01:37:24.474 --> 01:37:25.654]  I've seen pictures.
[01:37:25.714 --> 01:37:29.437]  I saw pictures of about 15 people run over on their bicycles by a tank.
[01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:31.338]  And just the aftermath of that.
[01:37:31.618 --> 01:37:33.339]  I didn't see the actual tank running them over.
[01:37:34.059 --> 01:37:38.202]  And I've seen... Do you see them in square footage of them shooting them?
[01:37:39.262 --> 01:37:39.543]  I didn't.
[01:37:39.563 --> 01:37:40.363]  I haven't seen that yet.
[01:37:40.483 --> 01:37:41.183]  No, I haven't.
[01:37:41.884 --> 01:37:45.026]  Because I mentioned... I started to talk... She was from China.
[01:37:45.106 --> 01:37:45.386]  In China.
[01:37:45.406 --> 01:37:47.307]  I was on an internet messaging program.
[01:37:47.967 --> 01:37:49.869]  And I said, you know, she said, what do you want to talk about?
[01:37:49.889 --> 01:37:51.970]  I said, how about we talk about the police state in China?
[01:37:52.389 --> 01:37:53.529]  And she's like, what do you mean?
[01:37:53.589 --> 01:37:54.850]  And I'm like, Cannabis Square.
[01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:56.270]  And she's like, that didn't happen.
[01:37:56.290 --> 01:37:56.730]  What do you mean?
[01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:57.450]  That didn't happen?
[01:37:57.490 --> 01:37:58.430]  I've never heard of it.
[01:37:58.850 --> 01:37:59.891]  The government wouldn't do that.
[01:37:59.911 --> 01:38:00.671]  The government's good.
[01:38:00.711 --> 01:38:01.771]  It only kills bad people.
[01:38:01.791 --> 01:38:04.472]  I was like, Jesus Christ.
[01:38:05.852 --> 01:38:11.013]  Yeah, they only kill bad people until they've blood-typed her and some upper party member needs her liver.
[01:38:11.413 --> 01:38:13.193]  And then she's going to get grabbed and taken off.
[01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:17.714]  Look, China can give you any organ you want in two weeks, period, anybody who wants them.
[01:38:18.215 --> 01:38:20.175]  And that's because they've got tissue-type prisoners.
[01:38:20.999 --> 01:38:25.000]  And right here in Texas, they've introduced legislation to let you out of prison early if you give organs.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.961]  Yeah, I saw the Sky News report on that one, in China.
[01:38:31.601 --> 01:38:36.702]  Now, my next question is this one, because I know you've got a busy show next month.
[01:38:36.742 --> 01:38:47.804]  I noticed on your website there was this UK Terror Report call-in number, and I was thinking I might ring it up and report advisor consulting for running drills on 7-7.
[01:38:49.173 --> 01:38:53.517]  And I tried to voice my concerns with them, but they hung up on me when I called.
[01:38:53.837 --> 01:39:01.544]  Oh, when you tried to call up and said the government was running drills with a private firm of the exact same targets, the exact same time being attacked, according to their director?
[01:39:01.585 --> 01:39:02.505]  They didn't want to talk about that?
[01:39:03.066 --> 01:39:06.289]  Yeah, well, maybe it was a lie, probably.
[01:39:06.869 --> 01:39:08.551]  I said, look, do you know anything about that?
[01:39:08.591 --> 01:39:09.292]  He goes, no, I don't know.
[01:39:09.332 --> 01:39:10.653]  And he just hung up on me, and I called again.
[01:39:10.913 --> 01:39:13.916]  And I was thinking, it would be interesting if we could get a recording of that.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.461]  And maybe if they could come in and say something.
[01:39:16.581 --> 01:39:18.361]  Do you think we'd get in trouble if we did that though?
[01:39:18.381 --> 01:39:18.821]  What do you think?
[01:39:19.042 --> 01:39:26.864]  No, as long as you really think you're reporting who the terrorists are, then that's who we know the terrorists are, so why not report them?
[01:39:28.125 --> 01:39:29.545]  Call up and say, yeah, it's the government.
[01:39:29.785 --> 01:39:30.505]  I'm here to tell you.
[01:39:32.146 --> 01:39:36.067]  Well, I might have to do that, put it on the website somewhere and give that a go.
[01:39:36.087 --> 01:39:39.248]  So I think maybe some of your listeners should give that one a go.
[01:39:39.788 --> 01:39:40.589]  How's the weather there?
[01:39:40.609 --> 01:39:41.569]  Where are you at in Australia?
[01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:43.391]  I'm in Sydney at the moment.
[01:39:43.411 --> 01:39:44.271]  It's about 5 a.m.
[01:39:44.331 --> 01:39:46.012]  I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd give you a call.
[01:39:46.872 --> 01:39:49.313]  Well, good to hear from you, and I appreciate you holding to talk to us.
[01:39:49.513 --> 01:39:53.555]  I forgot we had a call from Australia, or I would have skipped ahead to you're on your own dime.
[01:39:54.095 --> 01:39:55.616]  Then I kind of forgot about it.
[01:39:55.636 --> 01:39:56.976]  I'm like, oh, Eric from Australia.
[01:39:56.996 --> 01:39:57.437]  That's good.
[01:39:59.317 --> 01:39:59.778]  5 a.m.
[01:39:59.878 --> 01:40:00.278]  over there.
[01:40:00.318 --> 01:40:00.978]  What a trooper.
[01:40:01.058 --> 01:40:02.199]  Staying up close to the show.
[01:40:03.479 --> 01:40:06.560]  I was going to comment on these tattletale lines since you brought it up.
[01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:10.082]  What they do is, there's no real terrorists.
[01:40:10.544 --> 01:40:11.264]  Other than government.
[01:40:11.745 --> 01:40:13.045]  And SWAT teams and the stuff they do.
[01:40:13.065 --> 01:40:13.785]  That's terrorism.
[01:40:13.825 --> 01:40:14.546]  Terrorizing people.
[01:40:15.046 --> 01:40:16.066]  It's all about intimidation.
[01:40:16.086 --> 01:40:16.707]  That's the whole point.
[01:40:17.667 --> 01:40:20.148]  You know, the state puts up the cameras to terrorize you.
[01:40:20.188 --> 01:40:21.149]  Hey, we're watching you.
[01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:22.069]  You're being watched.
[01:40:22.609 --> 01:40:24.450]  They make the NSA a spy on you.
[01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:25.690]  Announcements to let you know.
[01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:27.671]  Hey, we're... It's to create a chilling effect.
[01:40:27.951 --> 01:40:29.172]  I say, good criminals!
[01:40:29.572 --> 01:40:36.355]  We're going to use this system so that all your people that have to listen to this and have to listen to our conversations get to hear what they're working for.
[01:40:36.375 --> 01:40:38.776]  I think it's going to backfire against them.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:55.829]  But they have these called terrorism hotlines, and then within a year of them putting them up in the US and Canada and England, then they start going, oh, and report crime, because there's not going to be any real terrorism.
[01:40:56.129 --> 01:41:06.415]  But they know that called tattletale numbers doesn't sound good, so they say it's for terror, and then they, oh, it's for crime, or did you see your neighbor yell at a child?
[01:41:06.475 --> 01:41:07.515]  That's abuse, too.
[01:41:07.575 --> 01:41:08.876]  They're now saying that.
[01:41:11.097 --> 01:41:15.500]  Look, the government literally is devouring the society.
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.864]  It's eating out our substance, as the founders said in the Declaration of Independence.
[01:41:21.845 --> 01:41:25.908]  It's feeding and feeding and feeding on us, and it's not going to stop growing.
[01:41:25.948 --> 01:41:29.231]  It's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger until we kill it.
[01:41:30.832 --> 01:41:34.394]  Once you go past the tipping point in tyranny, it doesn't know how to stop.
[01:41:34.575 --> 01:41:35.595]  It isn't going to stop.
[01:41:35.695 --> 01:41:39.058]  It's not going to stop until we completely destroy it.
[01:41:40.524 --> 01:41:41.384]  It's that simple.
[01:41:42.365 --> 01:41:45.106]  And the good news is that it's not that bad right now.
[01:41:45.146 --> 01:41:55.071]  There's still a lot of milk and honey, a lot of bobbles, a lot of trinkets, a lot of cheeseburgers, big pitchers of Budweiser, and so a lot of people know things are bad.
[01:41:55.131 --> 01:41:57.593]  They know things are going the wrong direction, but what can I do?
[01:41:58.373 --> 01:42:08.418]  But as things get a lot worse, people are going to remember the videos you gave them, the links you sent them, the stories they read, the things they heard, the things they laughed at.
[01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:14.527]  You see, a lot of times seeds don't sprout overnight.
[01:42:14.667 --> 01:42:16.128]  They don't sprout the first year.
[01:42:17.728 --> 01:42:30.133]  They have taken seeds of papyrus that were in the Great Pyramid from 3,000 plus years ago and they've sprouted anew.
[01:42:30.965 --> 01:42:33.807]  Well, we don't have to wait 3,000 years for these seeds to sprout.
[01:42:34.308 --> 01:42:37.030]  Just plant the seeds, move on.
[01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:47.519]  As the person under mind control giggles and sneers at you and snickers and chortles, you just say, thank you, I understand you're damaged, move on.
[01:42:47.559 --> 01:42:49.501]  Yes, I understand you're damaged, move on.
[01:42:49.601 --> 01:42:51.302]  Someday you may be able to repair yourself.
[01:42:52.864 --> 01:42:57.988]  Maybe you shouldn't even waste your time with somebody that laughs at you, but somebody that's like, oh, I don't believe it, say, well, just check it out for yourself.
[01:42:59.955 --> 01:43:01.056]  Or tell them it's Britney Spears.
[01:43:01.756 --> 01:43:02.156]  I don't know.
[01:43:04.297 --> 01:43:07.199]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Texas.
[01:43:07.219 --> 01:43:07.799]  You're on the air.
[01:43:07.839 --> 01:43:08.259]  Go ahead.
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:09.540]  Hello, Alex.
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:14.663]  My fellow loose cannon roaming around on the battleship Freedom here.
[01:43:14.943 --> 01:43:18.805]  I've got some information to add about Giuliani here that you've been talking about Giuliani today.
[01:43:19.425 --> 01:43:19.705]  Sure.
[01:43:20.385 --> 01:43:27.369]  On March 5th, Monday, March 5th, New York Times, there's a story about Giuliani has sold one of his investment banking firms.
[01:43:28.047 --> 01:43:30.008]  It's called Giuliani Capital Advisors.
[01:43:30.648 --> 01:43:36.129]  He purchased this from Ernst & Young back in 2004 for $9.8 million.
[01:43:36.429 --> 01:43:48.733]  And the reported value now that he's selling it, they haven't disclosed the actual amount that he sold it for, but reportedly it could be going from $80 million to $100 million.
[01:43:49.033 --> 01:43:53.174]  And he's selling to Macri of Australia, the Toll Road Consortium.
[01:43:55.715 --> 01:43:57.536]  Richard, that is really important news.
[01:43:57.576 --> 01:43:58.597]  Will you email me that?
[01:43:59.858 --> 01:44:01.199]  Absolutely.
[01:44:01.619 --> 01:44:02.179]  Which address?
[01:44:02.319 --> 01:44:04.801]  Well, I'll just call and get a good address.
[01:44:05.041 --> 01:44:05.521]  How's that?
[01:44:06.042 --> 01:44:07.163]  Is this Richard Reeves?
[01:44:07.503 --> 01:44:07.883]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:08.063 --> 01:44:09.084]  Hey man, how you doing?
[01:44:09.104 --> 01:44:10.144]  Oh, I'm doing great.
[01:44:10.885 --> 01:44:12.866]  Gotta get the story out about Giuliani.
[01:44:12.926 --> 01:44:17.409]  Tell you what, he's the front runner here and he's got all this dirt on him that we just need to keep exposed.
[01:44:17.429 --> 01:44:20.151]  Don't you have a website that's about toll roads?
[01:44:22.358 --> 01:44:25.039]  Yes, I do, but I don't have a good URL.
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:44.610]  I'll tell you what, if you go to a website called whatwillyoudowithoutfreedom.com, whatwillyoudowithoutfreedom.com, and that goes to a Real ID blog, and then if you go to my personal info, then you'll see all my other little blogs connected to that, and you can find that.
[01:44:45.422 --> 01:44:46.383]  Well, that's good, Richard.
[01:44:47.544 --> 01:44:50.868]  Now, I knew that this is how these delayed payoffs happen.
[01:44:50.888 --> 01:44:55.933]  They sell them investments, and then their buddies buy it for many, many times what it's actually worth.
[01:44:56.574 --> 01:45:07.445]  And isn't it interesting that that same Macri-Cintra just bought up all the major newspapers along the toll roads in Oklahoma and Texas, all the newspapers that have been criticizing
[01:45:07.845 --> 01:45:15.313]  Right, and it's so convenient that just right in time for this big presidential bid, he's getting a windfall of somewhere between $70, $80, $90 million for this big presidential bid.
[01:45:29.293 --> 01:45:33.436]  And, uh, you know, some people are saying, oh, well, that just buys McAree access to Giuliani.
[01:45:33.476 --> 01:45:36.398]  I'm sorry, but that just should almost damn near own him.
[01:45:36.438 --> 01:45:40.400]  You know, it's just hilarious that, uh, it's going on like that.
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:44.703]  But evidently, he's definitely, uh, absolutely one of the favorite candidates.
[01:45:44.743 --> 01:45:45.623]  I mean, we do know that.
[01:45:45.744 --> 01:45:47.925]  Well, I tell you, McAree plays for keeps.
[01:45:48.005 --> 01:45:49.606]  I mean, they're involved in everything.
[01:45:50.366 --> 01:45:50.667]  Right.
[01:45:50.847 --> 01:45:57.391]  And another deal that Giuliani was involved in is, uh, part of the investment, another investment arm that Giuliani has.
[01:45:58.166 --> 01:46:02.487]  Was involved in that Highway 121 up in Dallas, SH-121.
[01:46:03.588 --> 01:46:13.011]  Fintra got the contract for SH-121 up in North Dallas, and Giuliani partners were involved in that deal up there in North Dallas.
[01:46:13.031 --> 01:46:17.312]  So that was a real big situation with the toll roads going on there.
[01:46:17.352 --> 01:46:19.273]  They've got, I think it was $2.1 billion.
[01:46:19.293 --> 01:46:24.414]  Wait a minute, you mean that cockroach is involved in the Texas land grabbing?
[01:46:25.735 --> 01:46:26.515]  Yes, yes.
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:28.841]  Oh man, I'm so sick of him.
[01:46:29.902 --> 01:46:37.386]  Well, if you go to TexasTollParty.com and get into Sal's blog, you can find all the details on it.
[01:46:37.406 --> 01:46:43.029]  Sal Costello, I just, you know, this web that these spiders weave is so intricate.
[01:46:43.469 --> 01:46:45.110]  Okay, Richard, well, thanks for calling.
[01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:47.151]  Well, we'll keep digging the dirt.
[01:46:47.751 --> 01:46:49.112]  Yeah, that's good information.
[01:46:50.197 --> 01:46:51.798]  Richard hosts his own radio talk show.
[01:46:51.838 --> 01:46:52.499]  He's a nice fellow.
[01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:52.979]  I like him.
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:56.242]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:46:56.282 --> 01:46:58.444]  Let's talk to David in Northern California.
[01:46:58.484 --> 01:46:58.984]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:46:59.245 --> 01:46:59.725]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:00.005 --> 01:47:00.286]  Hi.
[01:47:00.546 --> 01:47:08.793]  I was a fireman for 30 years before 9-11, and 9-11 was the purposeful murder of 343 of my brothers, and I want justice now.
[01:47:09.233 --> 01:47:11.155]  I got six quick questions for Rudy.
[01:47:11.175 --> 01:47:12.135]  It's okay if I just blast them?
[01:47:12.155 --> 01:47:12.796]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:47:13.236 --> 01:47:13.497]  Okay.
[01:47:13.517 --> 01:47:14.137]  Hey, Rudy.
[01:47:14.517 --> 01:47:16.339]  Who told you the towers were going to collapse?
[01:47:16.843 --> 01:47:21.747]  Hey Rudy, why'd you send people back into the towers if you knew the towers were going to collapse?
[01:47:22.347 --> 01:47:26.670]  Hey Rudy, how many of our brothers did you help murder on 9-11?
[01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:29.552]  And how many did you murder with the dust?
[01:47:30.553 --> 01:47:31.313]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:47:31.914 --> 01:47:32.874]  I'm trying not to bully you out here.
[01:47:32.894 --> 01:47:34.215]  You know you're coming through loud and clear.
[01:47:34.315 --> 01:47:39.299]  Okay, hey Rudy, why'd you abandon your bomb shelter in World Trade Center number 7?
[01:47:39.399 --> 01:47:44.743]  Hey Rudy, why'd you destroy the crime scene?
[01:47:45.595 --> 01:47:50.976]  And last but not least, hey Rudy, who paid you for 9-11 and how much did you make?
[01:47:53.097 --> 01:47:53.697]  You know something?
[01:47:53.717 --> 01:47:58.658]  There's so many points that I haven't ever put together consciously.
[01:47:58.678 --> 01:47:59.818]  You just made one of them.
[01:48:00.438 --> 01:48:11.961]  We now know that there was a press release being put out by the World Trade Center Complex homepage on the computer saying that the North Tower was going to collapse
[01:48:13.702 --> 01:48:25.047]  After the South Tower had collapsed, and that they were telling everybody, but at the same time to stay in the building, and then they sent the firefighters up.
[01:48:26.207 --> 01:48:28.388]  Man, that is really bizarre.
[01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:32.430]  I mean, they just wanted, they just wanted dead firefighters.
[01:48:34.671 --> 01:48:35.251]  I agree with you.
[01:48:35.291 --> 01:48:42.994]  What do you think about the firefighter group coming to the public about how there was all that gold, and how as soon as they got that gold out, the rescue effort stopped?
[01:48:43.413 --> 01:48:44.514]  Yeah, I don't know about that one.
[01:48:44.534 --> 01:48:49.738]  I don't know, that kind of seems like one of those... might be a layer of disinformation, or it might be, you know, for real.
[01:48:49.758 --> 01:48:51.039]  Well, we know there was gold in there.
[01:48:51.359 --> 01:48:56.583]  I think they just wanted to get them off the pile so they'd stop noticing things like thermite leavings and such.
[01:48:57.483 --> 01:49:00.766]  Also, and just to make any kind of excuse to get stuff out of there.
[01:49:01.466 --> 01:49:03.508]  And by the way, they were starting to notice that.
[01:49:04.108 --> 01:49:04.389]  Yes.
[01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:07.191]  And there are pictures out there, of course, you know.
[01:49:07.731 --> 01:49:10.213]  It's getting hard for them to control people with their cameras, I think.
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:13.682]  I have another friend, a firefighter here, who wanted me to ask you one question.
[01:49:13.742 --> 01:49:13.983]  Sure.
[01:49:14.403 --> 01:49:20.968]  He said, according to the Bible, when someone says, war is peace, watch out.
[01:49:21.008 --> 01:49:21.608]  Have you heard that?
[01:49:22.169 --> 01:49:24.751]  Yeah, that's in Daniel and a couple other places.
[01:49:24.771 --> 01:49:27.293]  Daniel and a couple other places.
[01:49:27.333 --> 01:49:29.875]  Well, apparently George Bush said it about the Iraq War.
[01:49:29.915 --> 01:49:31.956]  The thing about the Iraq War is peace.
[01:49:33.497 --> 01:49:35.559]  I know, it's pretty scary when they start calling
[01:49:36.471 --> 01:49:37.773]  War, peace, look out.
[01:49:37.813 --> 01:49:38.895]  Tell your friend I said hi.
[01:49:39.496 --> 01:49:44.504]  Alright, we'll come back, take a few more calls that I'm going to get into the news and that we haven't covered.
[01:49:44.524 --> 01:49:45.786]  There is a lot of it.
[01:49:46.247 --> 01:49:47.589]  There is masses of it.
[01:49:47.949 --> 01:49:48.951]  We'll break it all down.
[01:49:49.011 --> 01:49:50.053]  PrisonPlanet.com
[01:49:57.142 --> 01:50:02.605]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.965 --> 01:50:10.589]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.303 --> 01:50:18.346]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.746 --> 01:50:30.171]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.491 --> 01:50:33.973]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.433 --> 01:50:36.374]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.714 --> 01:50:40.556]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.099 --> 01:50:59.303]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.463 --> 01:51:07.549]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.809 --> 01:51:14.854]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:15.034 --> 01:51:16.315]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:51:16.395 --> 01:51:22.299]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.499 --> 01:51:27.583]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.703 --> 01:51:36.569]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:36.829 --> 01:51:40.132]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:42.233 --> 01:51:42.553]  We're good.

[01:52:49.826 --> 01:52:52.448]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:53:25.715 --> 01:53:27.156]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:27.196 --> 01:53:27.897]  Welcome back.
[01:53:27.917 --> 01:53:29.197]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:53:29.217 --> 01:53:32.079]  I have made 12 films.
[01:53:36.323 --> 01:53:37.683]  That are now on DVD.
[01:53:37.723 --> 01:53:38.544]  Well, a total of 15.
[01:53:38.684 --> 01:53:43.305]  I keep forgetting that I got the last three that I hadn't put on DVD on DVD.
[01:53:43.385 --> 01:53:45.705]  So now we have all 15 on DVD.
[01:53:45.725 --> 01:53:50.726]  15 films that are on DVD now, including all three of my Police State films.
[01:53:51.146 --> 01:53:55.847]  Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:53:57.028 --> 01:54:01.609]  They are $34.95 for all three films.
[01:54:01.649 --> 01:54:01.909]  That's 45% off.
[01:54:04.295 --> 01:54:06.477]  Normally it'd be $60, it's $34.95.
[01:54:07.097 --> 01:54:10.100]  3 DVD, box set, $34.95.
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:11.421]  The Police State Classics.
[01:54:12.181 --> 01:54:31.057]  There, of course, there are all the other books and films we carry, like America, Freedom to Fascism, that will show your friends and family that the IRS is a private collection agency for the fellow reserve, that private bankers own us, and that we can set about changing that by becoming aware of this Matrix-like control.
[01:54:32.708 --> 01:54:37.030]  Other great films like Loose Change, Second Edition, 9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions.
[01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:41.652]  There's just so many great books and videos we carry at Infowars.com.
[01:54:42.152 --> 01:54:44.594]  So please call toll-free to get them at 888-253-3139.
[01:54:44.674 --> 01:54:45.194]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[01:54:45.294 --> 01:54:46.815]  Or you can just write to me.
[01:54:46.835 --> 01:54:48.715]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:55:02.597 --> 01:55:02.957]  We're good to go!
[01:55:19.264 --> 01:55:26.868]  Hundreds of weekly TV reports, hundreds of my best audio interviews, a bunch of other films we've been authorized to post, 15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:27.469 --> 01:55:33.832]  And your support of PrisonPlanet.TV funds the internet side of what we do, your purchase of the books and DVDs funds what we do.
[01:55:33.872 --> 01:55:37.855]  If you believe in what we do here, then you need to support us by getting the books and films.
[01:55:38.235 --> 01:55:45.719]  Plus, they'll educate you to a higher level and you can make copies of my films and get them out to others to spread the word about the criminal system that runs our society.
[01:55:47.139 --> 01:55:49.140]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:51.661]  Let us now talk... Who's up next here?
[01:55:52.782 --> 01:55:53.843]  Another Richard in Texas.
[01:55:53.883 --> 01:55:54.583]  Go ahead, Richard.
[01:55:55.083 --> 01:55:55.704]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:56.044 --> 01:55:57.204]  Just a couple of things.
[01:55:57.244 --> 01:56:03.148]  Wanted to put a plug in for the Musicians' March that's going on this weekend in Austin.
[01:56:03.968 --> 01:56:10.432]  That's going to be, you know, at downtown and gathering at the Capitol.
[01:56:10.612 --> 01:56:14.974]  It seems like yesterday they had that, but that was already a year ago, wasn't it?
[01:56:16.129 --> 01:56:18.112]  No, no, this is this coming Saturday, March 17th.
[01:56:18.152 --> 01:56:19.173]  You're not understanding.
[01:56:19.614 --> 01:56:20.916]  You're not understanding what I'm saying.
[01:56:21.757 --> 01:56:22.478]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[01:56:22.819 --> 01:56:26.484]  I'm saying it seems like yesterday that we had last year's March.
[01:56:26.764 --> 01:56:27.505]  I apologize.
[01:56:27.545 --> 01:56:27.705]  No, no.
[01:56:27.725 --> 01:56:28.967]  There's nothing to apologize about.
[01:56:29.027 --> 01:56:32.232]  I just... I don't think I communicate very well, but go ahead.
[01:56:32.879 --> 01:56:37.980]  Okay, it's instrumentsforpeace.org if you want to check out their website.
[01:56:38.401 --> 01:56:42.962]  I'd like to also put in a plug for G. Gordon School of Law.
[01:56:43.642 --> 01:56:57.726]  I think that guy is an awesome folksy guy that gets points across very well everything from pharmaceuticals to 9-11 and he's got a lot of information including free CDs that you can send out to people that I think make a pretty good introduction
[01:56:58.287 --> 01:56:58.768]  I think so.
[01:57:08.084 --> 01:57:09.926]  You need to move on, and I know it's painful.
[01:57:10.006 --> 01:57:11.467]  Let me comment on that when we get back.
[01:57:11.487 --> 01:57:12.088]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:12.108 --> 01:57:13.009]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:13.029 --> 01:57:13.389]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.590 --> 01:57:38.414]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.434 --> 01:57:38.555]  Help!
[01:57:49.776 --> 01:57:50.416]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.076 --> 01:57:52.157]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.857 --> 01:57:53.957]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.637 --> 01:57:55.438]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.178 --> 01:57:58.098]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.118 --> 01:58:01.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:06.021]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:33.001]  I remember years ago having a salesman explain it to me that statistically it's harder to sell, many times harder, several times harder to sell to friends and family, particularly family.
[01:58:34.722 --> 01:58:45.790]  Because family, when you try to tell them, hey, the dollar's been devalued, there's a world government, 9-11 is an inside job, they think you're showing off.
[01:58:47.891 --> 01:59:04.543]  So many times when I go out and do mail-in-the-street interviews, and I just did one Friday for the film I'm making, I'm talking to people and they get insulted by the fact that they don't know.
[01:59:05.323 --> 01:59:07.405]  I'm like, are you aware of the North American Union?
[01:59:07.425 --> 01:59:08.225]  Do you know what it is?
[01:59:09.466 --> 01:59:09.766]  No.
[01:59:10.107 --> 01:59:11.208]  And they turn red.
[01:59:11.268 --> 01:59:12.048]  They get upset.
[01:59:12.588 --> 01:59:14.390]  And some will say, do you know about this?
[01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:18.577]  Do you know about a 57 Chevy Carburetor?
[01:59:18.717 --> 01:59:19.758]  Oh, you don't, do you?
[01:59:20.239 --> 01:59:23.382]  Hey, man, I'm not trying to show off that I know something, okay?
[01:59:23.702 --> 01:59:26.084]  I'm very upset that you don't know.
[01:59:27.766 --> 01:59:29.627]  I need you to wake up so I can be free.
[01:59:30.488 --> 01:59:41.578]  But it's easier to sell, say, a vacuum cleaner or Gensu knives to somebody you don't know, whether you're knocking on their door or talking to them over your television set.
[01:59:42.228 --> 01:59:47.272]  It's the old parable of a king's not known in his country, a prophet's not known in his own country.
[01:59:49.074 --> 01:59:51.235]  Because, oh, that's just that local.
[01:59:51.436 --> 01:59:54.598]  Oh, he's not better than us, or she's not better than us.
[01:59:55.619 --> 02:00:01.284]  And so you're there trying to warn your family, and they're taking it like you're trying to act uppity with them.
[02:00:01.304 --> 02:00:02.905]  You're trying to act smart to them.
[02:00:03.505 --> 02:00:06.067]  And you're probably doing it real lovingly, real nice.
[02:00:06.688 --> 02:00:08.609]  You know, real, hey, you might want to check into this.
[02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:10.311]  Everybody says do it that way.
[02:00:10.371 --> 02:00:11.612]  I found that to be ineffective.
[02:00:12.378 --> 02:00:21.904]  You need to go listen, you're stupid and you don't know anything and you're ignorant and you need to wake up because you're in danger and these people mean business and they're bad news.
[02:00:23.205 --> 02:00:23.565]  Okay?
[02:00:24.486 --> 02:00:25.706]  Now that does work with family.
[02:00:26.967 --> 02:00:28.148]  And I'll just tell you point blank.
[02:00:31.072 --> 02:00:33.635]  I mean, it's almost like a mental connection.
[02:00:33.815 --> 02:00:41.402]  I mean, if you get mad at them, but like mad because you're frustrated or mad because you're like in an argument with them, it won't work.
[02:00:41.462 --> 02:00:44.705]  It's got to be like, hey, listen, we're in trouble.
[02:00:45.907 --> 02:00:46.567]  It's like this.
[02:00:47.228 --> 02:00:54.675]  If you ran into somebody's house and said, the dam just broke and the river's going to be 20 feet deep here in five minutes, we got to get in the car and get to high ground.
[02:00:55.387 --> 02:00:57.188]  And somebody said, no, you're a liar.
[02:00:57.268 --> 02:00:58.368]  You'd go, listen to me!
[02:00:58.648 --> 02:00:59.449]  It did break!
[02:00:59.649 --> 02:01:00.989]  Come on right now!
[02:01:03.150 --> 02:01:03.490]  Okay?
[02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:05.851]  I mean, you've got to let them know it's serious.
[02:01:05.871 --> 02:01:12.634]  So if you're going to waste your time with family, you're going to get a bigger conversion rate if you go and you stick a video in their hand.
[02:01:12.654 --> 02:01:15.595]  You go, now listen, you sit around making jokes about this stuff.
[02:01:16.115 --> 02:01:18.896]  If what I'm saying is true, we're all in grave danger.
[02:01:19.536 --> 02:01:21.657]  Now, you either watch this video,
[02:01:22.634 --> 02:01:25.415]  Or I'm going to stop hanging around you and I'm going to stop coming around you.
[02:01:25.435 --> 02:01:28.316]  I mean, you're worried about your family.
[02:01:28.336 --> 02:01:29.356]  You get serious with them.
[02:01:29.976 --> 02:01:30.556]  And you know what?
[02:01:30.576 --> 02:01:31.757]  Don't go see them for a year.
[02:01:33.457 --> 02:01:35.798]  And when they call you up going, hey, why aren't you coming over?
[02:01:36.018 --> 02:01:42.259]  Say, listen, you think it's funny that our country's being overthrown and foreign governments have totally paid off our government.
[02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:43.640]  You think it's funny.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.760]  So I don't want to associate with you.
[02:01:47.401 --> 02:01:48.801]  And most of the time they'll come around.
[02:01:49.721 --> 02:01:51.842]  Now, I'm not saying do that with your family.
[02:01:52.409 --> 02:01:56.075]  I mean, if I've got family that wants to suck their thumbs, I really don't have any family that isn't awake.
[02:01:56.777 --> 02:01:59.441]  But if I did have family that wanted to suck their thumbs and be mindless...
[02:02:02.429 --> 02:02:11.833]  I mean, you know, I just put up with it and don't bring it up, but if they, but then they'll try to bring up politics and I'll go, listen, you don't want to hear what's really going on, don't give me your, your fairy tale stuff, okay?
[02:02:12.394 --> 02:02:14.435]  Don't regurgitate your propaganda on me.
[02:02:14.735 --> 02:02:18.136]  You don't want to hear what I have to say, DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING!
[02:02:18.156 --> 02:02:19.517]  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
[02:02:19.797 --> 02:02:20.458]  SHUT UP!
[02:02:21.038 --> 02:02:22.118]  SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.681]  You want to know how I really feel, folks, that's how I feel.
[02:02:29.554 --> 02:02:35.040]  I mean, we got the facts, we got the evidence, we know what's going on, and we don't have time to play games!
[02:02:35.621 --> 02:02:36.582]  This isn't a game!
[02:02:36.802 --> 02:02:38.784]  A lot of us are gonna get killed fighting this!
[02:02:39.065 --> 02:02:40.426]  A lot of us aren't gonna live!
[02:02:40.626 --> 02:02:41.928]  A lot of us aren't gonna make it!
[02:02:48.729 --> 02:02:54.153]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.553 --> 02:03:02.159]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.873 --> 02:03:09.936]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.336 --> 02:03:21.761]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.061 --> 02:03:25.563]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.003 --> 02:03:27.964]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.304 --> 02:03:32.146]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:06.601 --> 02:04:07.882]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:04:07.962 --> 02:04:13.867]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:04:14.047 --> 02:04:19.131]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.

[02:04:33.643 --> 02:04:33.903]  I think?
[02:04:45.839 --> 02:04:48.180]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:50.462]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:50.602 --> 02:04:57.685]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:04:57.926 --> 02:05:06.550]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:05:06.850 --> 02:05:11.493]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:05:11.653 --> 02:05:18.341]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[02:05:18.521 --> 02:05:22.866]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:05:26.590 --> 02:05:26.770]  Call 1-800-340-7091
[02:05:47.696 --> 02:06:03.209]  Look, when you act serious, you're going to be taken seriously.
[02:06:03.309 --> 02:06:05.010]  And I don't even claim that I act that serious.
[02:06:05.311 --> 02:06:09.114]  Look, I think a lot of leadership is just not caring anymore.
[02:06:11.936 --> 02:06:12.877]  And just being committed.
[02:06:14.918 --> 02:06:16.559]  You're not caring what people think about you.
[02:06:16.859 --> 02:06:28.748]  I mean, a lot of people are so insecure, so afraid, they'll be sitting around a table when politics are being discussed, and they'll just listen to see what other folks are saying to try to imitate that so they can just be in.
[02:06:29.569 --> 02:06:32.291]  Can you imagine going through your life trying to be in?
[02:06:32.311 --> 02:06:35.373]  I mean, I think I got over that when I was about 11 years old.
[02:06:35.393 --> 02:06:36.714]  I think it was about a two-year phase.
[02:06:37.509 --> 02:06:51.535]  Can you imagine trying to... I remember being about 11 or 12 years old and trying to act like other people were acting, and in the middle of it, about 30 seconds into acting like they were acting, it was like I was above myself mentally.
[02:06:52.549 --> 02:06:57.232]  You know what I'm talking about, where you can, like, retrospectively look at what you're doing real time?
[02:06:57.932 --> 02:06:59.593]  And I remember thinking, this is stupid!
[02:07:00.093 --> 02:07:00.754]  It's dumb!
[02:07:00.854 --> 02:07:02.895]  It's fake to act like somebody else!
[02:07:03.255 --> 02:07:07.697]  It's dumb to behave a certain way, uh, to be around certain people.
[02:07:10.319 --> 02:07:13.601]  I mean, I was conscious of that when I was a little kid.
[02:07:15.062 --> 02:07:21.005]  And you've got these adults, all they do is primp and pose like a bunch of peacocks.
[02:07:22.505 --> 02:07:29.190]  And that's their life, is acting like they're something, and then if they look like they're something, they'll be accepted into the next level.
[02:07:29.490 --> 02:07:31.751]  And I know the world works like that, believe me!
[02:07:31.971 --> 02:07:33.452]  But I think it's disgusting!
[02:07:34.753 --> 02:07:35.754]  It makes me sick!
[02:07:38.315 --> 02:07:40.737]  And so, on purpose, I let it hang out.
[02:07:41.017 --> 02:07:42.598]  All of it hang out, as they say.
[02:07:42.898 --> 02:07:49.863]  I just am who I am, and that's just the way it is, and if you don't like it, you can, as they say, go fly a kite.
[02:07:51.681 --> 02:07:53.643]  I mean, life's too short to put on an act.
[02:07:54.023 --> 02:07:56.285]  Life is too short to play games with people.
[02:07:58.026 --> 02:08:09.656]  And if folks are laughing at you, and folks are making jokes about you, and snickering when you're warning them about incredible evil... I mean, we're talking about heavyweight subjects here.
[02:08:10.537 --> 02:08:12.238]  This is serious business.
[02:08:12.699 --> 02:08:14.580]  This is white-knuckle type stuff.
[02:08:16.262 --> 02:08:19.044]  And you've got people out there that think it's a joke.
[02:08:19.104 --> 02:08:19.965]  It's not a joke!
[02:08:22.452 --> 02:08:27.213]  And so the giggling, snickering type are lucky they don't get backhanded and get their teeth knocked out.
[02:08:28.614 --> 02:08:29.834]  Because that's what they deserve.
[02:08:33.635 --> 02:08:34.195]  I mean, really!
[02:08:34.835 --> 02:08:36.476]  We've got to realize we're on a mission.
[02:08:36.496 --> 02:08:37.716]  We're not playing games.
[02:08:38.036 --> 02:08:39.177]  This isn't a joke.
[02:08:39.997 --> 02:08:41.357]  This isn't dress rehearsal.
[02:08:41.637 --> 02:08:51.100]  This is real life against high-tech tyranny, running sophisticated mind control programs against the general public, openly setting up world government, and
[02:08:52.032 --> 02:09:12.843]  Every part of their plan they're implementing, you understand they do it step by step, like 1 through 100, or A through Z, they go right down the line and they say they're going to have one child policies worldwide, they say they're going to forcibly sterilize most of us, they say they're going to increase the number of kids grabbed by CPS,
[02:09:14.076 --> 02:09:19.299]  They're going to make us take hundreds of vaccines that actually attack our brain by design, publicly.
[02:09:19.539 --> 02:09:22.341]  These new vaccines, they admit attack your brain, but they just say it's good.
[02:09:22.981 --> 02:09:24.722]  They're going to militarize the police.
[02:09:24.742 --> 02:09:26.383]  They're going to have national drafts.
[02:09:26.703 --> 02:09:28.344]  They're going to have World War III.
[02:09:28.644 --> 02:09:30.745]  They're saying they're going to do all this.
[02:09:30.985 --> 02:09:33.567]  And let me tell you something, they've kept their promises in the past.
[02:09:33.907 --> 02:09:34.767]  And now, we're not in 1990.
[02:09:34.887 --> 02:09:35.548]  We're not in 1995.
[02:09:35.768 --> 02:09:37.048]  We're not in 1998 when we were saying, it's coming!
[02:09:37.208 --> 02:09:37.489]  It's coming!
[02:09:37.509 --> 02:09:37.909]  No man, it's here!
[02:09:42.171 --> 02:09:42.571]  Okay?
[02:09:42.771 --> 02:09:44.291]  We're in the North American Union.
[02:09:44.872 --> 02:09:45.252]  Okay?
[02:09:45.832 --> 02:09:48.552]  I mean, we're at the edge of the cliff now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:48.932 --> 02:09:50.033]  This is plunge time.
[02:09:50.593 --> 02:09:52.333]  Every day we get deeper into this.
[02:09:54.994 --> 02:09:57.074]  Every day we get further down the rat hole.
[02:09:58.695 --> 02:10:04.656]  By the way, John, did you get those clips from the newly unearthed footage exposing 9-11 media scripting?
[02:10:04.676 --> 02:10:07.616]  I'm going to do those at the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:07.636 --> 02:10:09.157]  Let me get into some other news right now, then.
[02:10:09.677 --> 02:10:09.897]  Thanks.
[02:10:11.846 --> 02:10:12.627]  I mean, look at this.
[02:10:15.349 --> 02:10:15.809]  Look at this.
[02:10:17.570 --> 02:10:35.303]  Now, two weeks ago, the UN came out and said, publicly, in a UN press release, that a world carbon tax, energy use tax, on any energy derived from carbon, where carbon is involved in any chain of its production,
[02:10:36.283 --> 02:10:44.526]  But there will be an energy tax that you will pay in to your respective nations who will then serve up a large portion of it to the United Nations.
[02:10:46.467 --> 02:10:47.867]  Now Bush isn't blocking that.
[02:10:47.907 --> 02:10:49.428]  He's just blocking the UN running it.
[02:10:49.888 --> 02:10:58.191]  He wants it to go directly to the private corporations of the IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization without it even going to the UN.
[02:10:59.691 --> 02:11:03.933]  So there is some struggling over the levers going on, but that's it.
[02:11:04.662 --> 02:11:11.105]  They've decided to stick our heads in the guillotine, they're just fighting over who gets to pull the lever, who gets to kick the trigger.
[02:11:12.986 --> 02:11:14.967]  That's the only debate going on here, okay?
[02:11:16.748 --> 02:11:32.877]  And we talk about this, and we talk about it, and we go, okay, global warming isn't real, and by that it's not man-made, here's all the ice core samples, they're lying to you, the sun's heating up, the ice caps are melting on Mars, and on Titan, and this is happening,
[02:11:34.734 --> 02:11:38.576]  And you need to be aware of this, and here's all the scientific reports.
[02:11:40.376 --> 02:11:47.419]  Again, you've got a general public, ladies and gentlemen, who literally are mindless children.
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:51.961]  I mean, my God, are they self-centered.
[02:11:51.981 --> 02:11:52.681]  You just look at them.
[02:11:52.701 --> 02:11:53.782]  You can tell they're all play acting.
[02:11:53.802 --> 02:11:55.142]  They're all living in their own mind.
[02:11:55.442 --> 02:11:56.923]  They've all got this act going on.
[02:11:57.003 --> 02:11:58.403]  Adults, women, men.
[02:11:58.423 --> 02:12:02.585]  And you're trying, and so they can't even get outside their own heads.
[02:12:03.459 --> 02:12:11.725]  How they're going to strut in and act cool when they walk into the office, or how they're going to print properly, or who they're going to have sex with tomorrow.
[02:12:12.806 --> 02:12:15.148]  And they can't even plan out a month.
[02:12:15.288 --> 02:12:20.472]  They're strung out on credit cards, but by God, they're driving a fancy car, so at least they look cool.
[02:12:21.253 --> 02:12:25.356]  And again, most adults cannot tell you how many continents there are.
[02:12:25.376 --> 02:12:28.438]  I use that example because I just can't believe people don't know how many continents there are.
[02:12:29.477 --> 02:12:31.440]  Hell, some adults don't know what a continent is.
[02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:33.743]  The President doesn't know what continents are.
[02:12:34.224 --> 02:12:35.586]  He's shown it over and over again.
[02:12:36.086 --> 02:12:37.628]  He thinks countries are continents.
[02:12:39.892 --> 02:12:42.315]  He thinks Nigeria is a continent.
[02:12:44.918 --> 02:12:48.059]  Most high school graduates don't know who the Vice President is.
[02:12:48.199 --> 02:12:50.119]  Most don't know what the First Amendment is.
[02:12:50.199 --> 02:12:52.580]  Most of them, I mean, folks, they have all these studies.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:54.080]  You know, they come out four or five times a year.
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:00.141]  And we get dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber!
[02:13:01.721 --> 02:13:04.862]  And then we get up here and try to explain to them ice cores.
[02:13:05.742 --> 02:13:09.223]  And the fact that carbon dioxide increases follow heating.
[02:13:10.678 --> 02:13:15.520]  And that plants then reabsorb that at an accelerated rate and actually greens the planet.
[02:13:15.741 --> 02:13:19.843]  And that increases overall oxygen level that's good for animal life, including us.
[02:13:20.363 --> 02:13:21.563]  Homo sapiens sapiens.
[02:13:22.484 --> 02:13:25.185]  They don't know what Homo sapiens sapiens is.
[02:13:25.665 --> 02:13:27.806]  They don't know what ice cores are.
[02:13:28.227 --> 02:13:31.028]  They don't know the life cycle of plants and animals.
[02:13:31.528 --> 02:13:35.070]  And so it's like we're literally talking Chinese to them!
[02:13:37.695 --> 02:13:38.857]  It's like we're talking gibberish.
[02:13:38.877 --> 02:13:40.919]  You're trying to talk to the average adult out there.
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:57.957]  All he knows about is how to make money in his business and how to keep his wife off his back and you're sitting there trying to tell him this stuff and you might as well be going... He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
[02:14:03.081 --> 02:14:08.343]  It's just like some cop and you try to explain to him that a warrantless checkpoint is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:14:08.703 --> 02:14:12.965]  All they know is they were told to do that by their commanding officer and so it must be true.
[02:14:13.065 --> 02:14:13.985]  It must be okay.
[02:14:16.966 --> 02:14:20.388]  Brown wants new world order to fight global warming.
[02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:30.051]  Now I've got about ten articles here in the stack from yesterday and today where they're all announcing this simultaneously.
[02:14:30.431 --> 02:14:31.732]  All off the same sheet of music.
[02:14:33.493 --> 02:14:39.798]  Gordon Brown, likely to be the next Prime Minister, will deliver a speech calling for a new world order to combat global warming on Monday.
[02:14:41.359 --> 02:14:43.180]  That's today, and I'm told he's about to give it.
[02:14:44.041 --> 02:14:59.672]  According to excerpts released by the Finance Ministry, Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown, he runs the money purse for the Bank of England, will also say the United Nations should make the fight against global warming a core pillar of its international mission
[02:15:00.370 --> 02:15:13.762]  Brown will praise the European Union's progress in combating climate change after EU leaders on Friday agreed to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 20% by 2020 with a tax compared to 1990 levels.
[02:15:17.545 --> 02:15:24.251]  He is set to announce domestic policy proposals that are targeted at helping Britain save energy thereby cutting their individual carbon emissions
[02:15:25.114 --> 02:15:25.874]  It's a tax, folks.
[02:15:26.235 --> 02:15:29.976]  Ahead of the government's publication of the Climate Change Bill on Tuesday.
[02:15:30.276 --> 02:15:34.538]  People want to make the right choices, and they want to make the right decisions.
[02:15:34.578 --> 02:15:40.861]  Brown will say government must provide practical help with whatever possible incentives and preference penalties.
[02:15:42.822 --> 02:15:43.502]  Which is the tax.
[02:15:43.983 --> 02:15:50.005]  Brown is the favorite to be Britain's next Prime Minister, as Tony Blair has pledged to step down in September.
[02:15:50.025 --> 02:15:53.267]  And of course, he's a conservative calling for a global tax.
[02:15:55.459 --> 02:16:00.665]  And what's the UN going to do with all the trillions they're going to make off this, taxing every industrialized nation?
[02:16:00.705 --> 02:16:04.489]  They're going to pass more laws and more regulations and more control.
[02:16:06.051 --> 02:16:14.380]  And then you live on the British sea coast and you shovel some sand out of your garden that blew up in your yard, a one-wheelbarrow, six months in jail, $100,000 fine, 50,000 pound fine.
[02:16:18.678 --> 02:16:20.681]  You drip motor oil, prison time.
[02:16:20.701 --> 02:16:26.288]  They're passing the laws here, Europe, and England, Australia, to where it just gets you into the system.
[02:16:27.348 --> 02:16:53.653]  Nothing to do with the environment, while they splice human genes into corn, and soybeans, and rice, and pig genes into the food, and all sorts of chimera problems, all sorts of amino acid toxicity problems, massive cancer increases, they're releasing genetically engineered plankton into the ocean, it's causing all, it's like they're trying to kill the earth, while running around saying that they're going to have a global tax
[02:16:54.986 --> 02:16:58.808]  To reduce emissions when it doesn't even affect climate change.
[02:17:02.730 --> 02:17:03.751]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:17:04.531 --> 02:17:05.392]  And they're going to do it.
[02:17:06.792 --> 02:17:08.293]  They know transportation is the key.
[02:17:08.393 --> 02:17:09.894]  Everything is built on transportation.
[02:17:10.294 --> 02:17:15.277]  So they're going to tax you 160-something bucks to drive to Dallas from Austin and back.
[02:17:15.317 --> 02:17:16.318]  That's the official numbers.
[02:17:16.698 --> 02:17:18.219]  Foreign companies are going to run it all.
[02:17:18.419 --> 02:17:20.460]  They're going to tax every piece of plastic you've got.
[02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:22.181]  Anything that's got petrochemicals.
[02:17:22.970 --> 02:17:26.772]  It's just, it's going to be, it's unbelievable.
[02:17:27.912 --> 02:17:29.353]  And they're going to just do it.
[02:17:29.673 --> 02:17:43.159]  And they've got CNN, Fox pushing it, they've got Sports Illustrated, the National Football League, just every stinking Fortune 500 company is pushing this hoax because they're going to suck out of the tax trough.
[02:17:43.559 --> 02:17:44.760]  They're going to get the corporate welfare.
[02:17:45.797 --> 02:17:48.678]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:49.038 --> 02:17:51.900]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:52.140 --> 02:17:58.342]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:17:58.702 --> 02:18:06.025]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:18:06.205 --> 02:18:10.287]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[02:18:48.752 --> 02:18:49.153]  It's March 12, 2007.
[02:18:49.213 --> 02:18:53.296]  Gold is at $646.90 and 1 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $670.04, $337.57 for half, and $168.79 for quarter ounce coins at $670.04, $337.57, and $168.79.
[02:19:04.924 --> 02:19:08.547]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[02:19:08.607 --> 02:19:11.629]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[02:19:11.729 --> 02:19:20.897]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[02:19:21.197 --> 02:19:26.501]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[02:19:26.981 --> 02:19:29.322]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[02:19:29.342 --> 02:19:31.783]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[02:19:32.183 --> 02:19:35.485]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:19:35.565 --> 02:19:39.266]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[02:19:39.327 --> 02:19:39.587]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:39.607 --> 02:19:39.787]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.147 --> 02:19:48.610]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.090 --> 02:19:54.636]  Did you know that communism has stated that America would not jump from capitalism to communism?
[02:19:54.656 --> 02:20:03.226]  That our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America and one day we would wake up and have socialism communism and not even know how it happened?
[02:20:04.026 --> 02:20:08.468]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[02:20:09.449 --> 02:20:14.051]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism-communism and don't even know it.
[02:20:14.671 --> 02:20:16.452]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said.
[02:20:17.092 --> 02:20:24.796]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:25.596 --> 02:20:27.078]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.178 --> 02:20:28.259]  That's 1-800-516-8736 for your subscription.
[02:20:28.319 --> 02:20:28.879]  Call now.

[02:20:45.911 --> 02:20:48.333]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:20:48.833 --> 02:20:52.155]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:20:52.515 --> 02:20:55.477]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:20:55.737 --> 02:21:02.121]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:21:02.181 --> 02:21:06.604]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:21:06.824 --> 02:21:11.186]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:21:11.346 --> 02:21:13.947]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:21:13.967 --> 02:21:16.748]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:21:17.208 --> 02:21:19.749]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:21:19.789 --> 02:21:24.031]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:21:24.091 --> 02:21:24.951]  Treasury bonds.
[02:21:25.211 --> 02:21:29.854]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:21:30.034 --> 02:21:31.675]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:21:31.695 --> 02:21:34.076]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:22:10.751 --> 02:22:11.892]  All right, welcome back here.
[02:22:11.912 --> 02:22:15.314]  They're openly setting up world government.
[02:22:15.374 --> 02:22:17.255]  They've got a huge PR campaign.
[02:22:17.275 --> 02:22:18.816]  The sky is falling.
[02:22:18.836 --> 02:22:19.396]  Global warming!
[02:22:19.416 --> 02:22:20.277]  What are we going to do?
[02:22:20.517 --> 02:22:22.899]  We've got to stop climate change!
[02:22:23.499 --> 02:22:25.320]  No discussion of what the solution is.
[02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:27.221]  And then finally, oh, it's a tax.
[02:22:27.621 --> 02:22:28.902]  It's a global tax.
[02:22:29.923 --> 02:22:30.703]  Oh, surprise.
[02:22:30.963 --> 02:22:32.324]  It's called the New World Order.
[02:22:32.724 --> 02:22:33.685]  It will save you.
[02:22:36.053 --> 02:22:39.737]  Meanwhile, I remember, this is the type of tricks they play to manipulate you, okay?
[02:22:39.777 --> 02:22:41.559]  The Iraq War starts four years ago.
[02:22:41.579 --> 02:22:43.961]  In a couple days, it'll be four years.
[02:22:45.002 --> 02:22:45.863]  They'll be talking about this in 20.
[02:22:46.023 --> 02:22:47.325]  It's still there.
[02:22:47.385 --> 02:22:50.248]  It's for America, though.
[02:22:50.268 --> 02:22:50.748]  It's good.
[02:22:50.788 --> 02:22:51.869]  They didn't lie to us.
[02:22:52.530 --> 02:22:53.691]  The government don't lie.
[02:22:53.871 --> 02:22:54.532]  I gotta stop it.
[02:22:54.552 --> 02:22:56.194]  I'm just so cynical and angry right now.
[02:22:57.875 --> 02:22:59.157]  But this is the type of tricks they play.
[02:23:01.096 --> 02:23:01.376]  U.S.
[02:23:01.416 --> 02:23:02.696]  companies start complaining.
[02:23:02.736 --> 02:23:04.977]  They start going, you know, these are no-bid contracts.
[02:23:05.357 --> 02:23:07.017]  We're not allowed to even bid.
[02:23:07.517 --> 02:23:14.579]  Only a handful, Halliburton, Bechtel, and others are allowed to get these hundreds of billions in contracts in Iraq and surrounding areas.
[02:23:15.099 --> 02:23:18.059]  And so Fox News, CNN, all of them went off the script.
[02:23:18.499 --> 02:23:19.159]  Just big money.
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.420]  And they got to work for their bosses.
[02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:23.200]  One, CNN is to fool the liberals.
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:24.660]  Fox is to fool the conservatives.
[02:23:25.441 --> 02:23:27.141]  Same info, just different presentation.
[02:23:28.385 --> 02:23:33.729]  And I heard the neocons simultaneously on talk radio go, Can you believe them evil French?
[02:23:33.889 --> 02:23:35.791]  They want contracts in Iraq.
[02:23:37.452 --> 02:23:38.773]  Of course there's no bid.
[02:23:38.813 --> 02:23:40.975]  Of course we don't let foreigners bid.
[02:23:42.056 --> 02:23:44.177]  Folks, the foreigners were never allowed to bid.
[02:23:44.237 --> 02:23:46.179]  The foreigners weren't even complaining about it.
[02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:49.101]  It had been in the news that U.S.
[02:23:49.582 --> 02:23:51.103]  companies wanted to bid.
[02:23:52.094 --> 02:23:59.976]  And other British companies wanted to bid, and they weren't allowed to, so they knew they could come out to the American people and go, the French want to bid!
[02:24:00.236 --> 02:24:01.577]  Should they be able to?
[02:24:02.037 --> 02:24:09.899]  And I heard the callers call on top of the radio, they're not putting no blood on the ground, and we need to not give them Frenchies none of the contracts.
[02:24:12.873 --> 02:24:15.794]  I mean, they play you like you're stupid.
[02:24:16.054 --> 02:24:16.614]  And you know what?
[02:24:16.714 --> 02:24:18.334]  I guess you are, some of you out there.
[02:24:18.654 --> 02:24:20.435]  I mean, you think it's funny to be played?
[02:24:20.915 --> 02:24:22.756]  You think it's funny to have them laughing at you?
[02:24:22.776 --> 02:24:24.716]  No bid!
[02:24:24.756 --> 02:24:26.516]  That means nobody gets to bid!
[02:24:26.857 --> 02:24:31.058]  Do you understand what they superimpose the word no bid with foreign contracts?
[02:24:32.498 --> 02:24:34.218]  And it worked like a charm on you, didn't it?
[02:24:34.438 --> 02:24:34.879]  Mm-hmm.
[02:24:35.599 --> 02:24:40.380]  As long as you get to feel good and feel like you're in charge, it's okay even if you aren't, right?
[02:24:41.681 --> 02:24:48.864]  Just stick some more American flag stickers on your car while the country burns, while the Bill of Rights is destroyed, while the sovereignty is annihilated.
[02:24:49.264 --> 02:24:53.746]  Two-year anniversary next week of the signing of the SPP, North American Union.
[02:24:54.026 --> 02:24:56.327]  But why not just deny it's been set up?
[02:24:56.467 --> 02:24:58.547]  Yeah, just say I'm a liar.
[02:24:58.587 --> 02:24:59.788]  Here, let's say it together.
[02:24:59.988 --> 02:25:01.208]  Right, Bush didn't sign it.
[02:25:01.248 --> 02:25:02.049]  Everything's fine.
[02:25:02.309 --> 02:25:03.609]  That Alex is bad.
[02:25:03.669 --> 02:25:05.210]  Okay, everything's fine.
[02:25:06.751 --> 02:25:10.312]  You can walk up to me on the street and tell me Bush isn't for the assault of his band, too, right?
[02:25:11.477 --> 02:25:12.118]  Right?
[02:25:12.818 --> 02:25:13.419]  It's okay.
[02:25:13.439 --> 02:25:14.600]  Just believe what you want.
[02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:16.642]  Believe the moon is made of cheese.
[02:25:19.244 --> 02:25:20.806]  Why did I get back to the contractors?
[02:25:21.226 --> 02:25:24.889]  Halliburton plans move to Dubai, BBC.
[02:25:26.551 --> 02:25:29.353]  Halliburton, the oil services company, formerly headed by U.S.
[02:25:29.393 --> 02:25:32.936]  Vice President Dick Cheney, is moving its headquarters from Texas to Dubai.
[02:25:33.477 --> 02:25:37.821]  The company said it hoped to move the United Arab Emirates would help it expand its business in the Middle East.
[02:25:38.985 --> 02:25:47.331]  Halliburton won valuable contracts in Iraq following the U.S.-led invasion of 2003, some of which were awarded without competitive bidding.
[02:25:47.831 --> 02:25:51.073]  The company also has extensive operations in Saudi Arabia.
[02:25:51.793 --> 02:25:55.256]  Well, yeah, they've got a lot of kidnapped children who go to Saudi Arabia.
[02:25:55.456 --> 02:25:57.577]  Most of them get taken to them, and that's where the funds are.
[02:25:58.498 --> 02:26:01.500]  For the people that run Halliburton, everybody knows what Dick Cheney likes.
[02:26:02.455 --> 02:26:04.476]  He gets a little too excited though and has those heart attacks.
[02:26:04.656 --> 02:26:07.278]  He doesn't like children and women, but he likes to get brittle.
[02:26:07.718 --> 02:26:09.159]  Heard all the reports we've got.
[02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:12.521]  Oh, I know, he's a good Christian.
[02:26:12.581 --> 02:26:13.422]  I'm sorry.
[02:26:13.922 --> 02:26:15.463]  That's just me lying to you.
[02:26:15.483 --> 02:26:16.283]  You know how it is.
[02:26:16.343 --> 02:26:18.324]  He's a good man of America.
[02:26:19.385 --> 02:26:25.048]  And he really shot Whittington at 90 feet away and it went into his heart with those pellets.
[02:26:26.109 --> 02:26:27.610]  And you believe that too, don't you?
[02:26:28.791 --> 02:26:30.772]  Halliburton plans to move to Dubai.
[02:26:33.386 --> 02:26:44.568]  As the CEO, I'm responsible for the global business of Halliburton in both hemispheres, and I will continue to spend quite a bit of time in an airplane as I remain attentive to our customers, shareholders, and employees around the world," he said.
[02:26:45.088 --> 02:26:46.849]  Chief Executive Dave Lesser.
[02:26:47.549 --> 02:26:48.689]  Alright, let me just stop right there.
[02:26:53.450 --> 02:26:54.130]  That's how it works.
[02:26:54.170 --> 02:27:02.092]  They get no-bid contracts from our government in the hundreds of billions, and they leave to go over there to Dubai, where they're not going to pay hardly any taxes, and that's why.
[02:27:04.782 --> 02:27:08.763]  And most of our companies aren't even American now.
[02:27:08.823 --> 02:27:10.484]  They're totally outside the U.S.
[02:27:10.604 --> 02:27:12.004]  We're to be raped, okay?
[02:27:12.264 --> 02:27:15.605]  We're the land of the... We're like the right whale.
[02:27:15.625 --> 02:27:17.766]  You know why the right whale was called the right whale?
[02:27:18.566 --> 02:27:24.008]  I'll tell you about the right whale, which should be what the American people are called.
[02:27:24.268 --> 02:27:25.108]  The right people.
[02:27:26.268 --> 02:27:29.990]  I'll tell you about the right whale when we get back, because we're the right whale of humanity.
[02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:31.390]  Oh, yes we are.
[02:27:35.955 --> 02:27:38.965]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.888 --> 02:27:42.557]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.266 --> 02:27:47.967]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:27:48.127 --> 02:27:49.388]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:27:49.628 --> 02:27:52.450]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:27:52.810 --> 02:27:55.572]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:27:56.113 --> 02:28:02.857]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:29:50.330 --> 02:29:57.655]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:29:58.096 --> 02:30:09.063]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:30:09.123 --> 02:30:09.584]  Central.
[02:30:09.944 --> 02:30:15.528]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:30:15.888 --> 02:30:21.773]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:30:22.253 --> 02:30:26.997]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:30:27.398 --> 02:30:32.181]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.

[02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:49.767]  We are armed!
[02:30:49.807 --> 02:30:51.608]  What would you really do?
[02:30:51.668 --> 02:30:53.829]  Do all the things we knew?
[02:30:54.009 --> 02:30:56.010]  Would you stand up or shoot?
[02:30:56.130 --> 02:30:59.011]  Or would you turn away too?
[02:30:59.411 --> 02:31:04.393]  And then what if you saw All of the things that's wrong?
[02:31:04.473 --> 02:31:06.574]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[02:31:06.594 --> 02:31:09.696]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[02:31:09.736 --> 02:31:11.577]  What would you really do?
[02:31:11.617 --> 02:31:14.098]  Do all the things we knew?
[02:31:14.901 --> 02:31:16.602]  Would you stand up for truth?
[02:31:16.642 --> 02:31:19.725]  Or would you turn away too?
[02:31:20.225 --> 02:31:21.806]  And then what if you don't?
[02:31:21.866 --> 02:31:24.629]  All of the things that's wrong?
[02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:27.351]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[02:31:28.051 --> 02:31:29.512]  Or would you turn away?
[02:31:29.773 --> 02:31:32.515]  I see a message from the government, like every day.
[02:31:32.775 --> 02:31:35.337]  I watch it and listen, and call them all suckers.
[02:31:35.617 --> 02:31:37.699]  They warning me about Osama or whatever.
[02:31:37.939 --> 02:31:39.600]  Picture me behind this scam.
[02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:40.461]  I said, never.
[02:31:40.861 --> 02:31:43.303]  You in tune to a hard truth, so just spit it.
[02:31:43.523 --> 02:31:44.544]  I say, commit it, give it.
[02:31:45.124 --> 02:31:45.945]  I lose commission.
[02:31:46.125 --> 02:31:48.666]  It's all a part of fightin' devil's state mind control.
[02:31:48.766 --> 02:31:51.128]  And all about the battle for your body, mind, and soul.
[02:31:51.208 --> 02:31:53.929]  And now I'm hopin' you don't close your mind so they shape ya.
[02:31:54.089 --> 02:31:56.470]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS, and raped us.
[02:31:56.611 --> 02:31:59.052]  Another push season mean another war for profit.
[02:31:59.292 --> 02:32:01.813]  All a secret so the public never stick to shoppin'.
[02:32:01.853 --> 02:32:04.095]  The Illuminati, triple six, all connected.
[02:32:04.195 --> 02:32:07.076]  So the folks they control the race and take elections.
[02:32:07.136 --> 02:32:09.698]  It's the skull and bones, remakes, and kill committee.
[02:32:09.718 --> 02:32:11.999]  See the dragon get eaten up in every city.
[02:32:12.339 --> 02:32:17.462]  What would you do if you knew all of the things we do?
[02:32:17.542 --> 02:32:19.184]  Would you stand up for truth?
[02:32:19.204 --> 02:32:22.666]  Or would you turn away truth?
[02:32:22.846 --> 02:32:30.050]  And when you're hitting stone, all of the things that's wrong, would you stand tall and strong?
[02:32:30.691 --> 02:32:32.292]  Or would you turn them off?
[02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:35.491]  Now ask yourself, who's the one with the most to gain?
[02:32:35.631 --> 02:32:38.091]  Well, round 11 must be me, cause he stand his name.
[02:32:38.212 --> 02:32:40.852]  Now even now, he's waving flags like they lost their mind.
[02:32:41.072 --> 02:32:43.333]  Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time.
[02:32:43.613 --> 02:32:46.034]  Cause America's been took, it's plain to see.
[02:32:46.074 --> 02:32:48.374]  The oldest trick in the book is make an enemy.
[02:32:48.714 --> 02:32:51.135]  A phony evil so the government can do its dirt.
[02:32:51.335 --> 02:32:53.636]  And take over your freedom, lock and load, beat and search.
[02:32:53.936 --> 02:32:56.397]  And nothing's changed, but more colored people locked in prison.
[02:32:56.417 --> 02:32:58.977]  These pigs still beat us, but it seems we forgetting.
[02:32:59.137 --> 02:33:01.498]  But I remember 4-6-10 by how these devils do it.
[02:33:02.138 --> 02:33:04.240]  Giuliani at Diallo, how he doin'?
[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:06.321]  We in the streets, holla, jail to the feet!
[02:33:06.401 --> 02:33:09.102]  Follow fuckin' waving flag, bring these dragons to they knees!
[02:33:09.283 --> 02:33:11.644]  Oil, blood, money, make these killers ride cold!
[02:33:11.744 --> 02:33:14.326]  Suspicious suicide, people dyin' never told!
[02:33:14.346 --> 02:33:17.227]  It's all a part of playin' God, so you think we need him?
[02:33:17.247 --> 02:33:20.109]  Swap in Ashcroft, take away your rights to freedom!
[02:33:20.149 --> 02:33:22.451]  Bare witness to the sickness of these dictators!
[02:33:22.751 --> 02:33:25.612]  Hope you understand the time, brother, cause it's major!
[02:33:25.672 --> 02:33:26.893]  Why don't you do it?
[02:33:26.973 --> 02:33:27.914]  What you do?
[02:33:28.034 --> 02:33:29.695]  It's one of the things we do!
[02:33:41.563 --> 02:33:48.666]  So now you askin' why my records always come the same?
[02:33:48.886 --> 02:34:04.132]  Keep it real, ain't no fillers, nothing but a blingin' Mine eyes seen the gory of the comin' of the beast So every story, every word, I'm sayin' peace See, you can witness the Illuminati's body count Don't be surprised, these is devils that I'm talkin' bout You think a couple thousand lives mean shit to killers?
[02:34:04.372 --> 02:34:09.434]  Nigga, I swear to God, we the ones, ain't no villains Or any other word they think to demonize the country
[02:34:09.674 --> 02:34:09.874]  Let's go!
[02:34:25.573 --> 02:34:48.515]  I'm talkin' loud but ain't nobody sayin' it And with the vocal mimic on, I got on the first That's why I'm spittin' cyanide each and every verse I see the Carlisle group in Harris Bank accounts I see them feed the fifth each and every session now And while white stag burns, see the public buy it I see the profile and see the media's compliance War is good for business, see the vicious make a savior Hope you understand the time, brothers, cause it's major
[02:34:49.535 --> 02:34:52.296]  Hope you understand the time, brother, because it's major.
[02:34:52.556 --> 02:34:53.056]  Oh, man.
[02:34:53.796 --> 02:34:55.616]  That song just randomly plays in rotation.
[02:34:55.636 --> 02:34:57.117]  It's just hard to not let it play through.
[02:34:57.137 --> 02:35:00.237]  I think that's the best hip-hop song.
[02:35:00.277 --> 02:35:02.918]  Best song, period, about the New World Order I've ever heard.
[02:35:02.958 --> 02:35:04.398]  He does it all there in one place.
[02:35:06.458 --> 02:35:07.759]  So, good job to Paris there.
[02:35:07.779 --> 02:35:10.099]  You know, I could have spent all day on this.
[02:35:10.159 --> 02:35:11.359]  I should have spent all day on this.
[02:35:11.379 --> 02:35:13.240]  I could have spent all day on this one.
[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:14.320]  Look at this story.
[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:19.144]  Before I get to that one, Iranian defector may hold catalysts for war.
[02:35:19.384 --> 02:35:29.393]  Jerusalem Newswire, an Iranian defense official who reportedly defected to the West late last week, may be in possession of evidence that could be used to justify military action against Iran.
[02:35:31.095 --> 02:35:39.723]  Now, if you go back to the White House memo, he's sitting there with Tony Blair, Bush's, concocting how to get a defector to come out of a payoff to claim he saw WMDs.
[02:35:41.741 --> 02:35:46.205]  And see, even if you buy into that, who's to say who can have WMDs or who can't?
[02:35:48.407 --> 02:35:49.307]  That's a side issue.
[02:35:49.327 --> 02:35:53.811]  They set the precedent here that if you have WMDs, you can be invaded, if you're not a good globalist.
[02:35:54.692 --> 02:36:04.140]  But then on top of it, we know this administration lies and cooks stuff up all the time, so now we're hearing, oh my gosh, they got the evidence of WMDs, ooh, the war is on.
[02:36:05.675 --> 02:36:22.484]  Former Iranian Deputy Defense Minister Ali Rez Azgari was secreted away from Turkey to be an undisclosed location in Europe by Western officials, this after he informed American officials several weeks earlier that he wished to defect and provide assistance in bringing down those running his country.
[02:36:24.745 --> 02:36:26.466]  All right on time, of course.
[02:36:27.146 --> 02:36:29.127]  But here's another one that I could spend all day on.
[02:36:29.588 --> 02:36:32.269]  Cashless Society by 2012 says Visa Chief
[02:36:33.146 --> 02:36:37.697]  Paying for goods with notes and coins could be consigned to history within five years.
[02:36:38.499 --> 02:36:41.346]  According to the Chief Executive of Visa Europe, Peter
[02:36:43.075 --> 02:36:49.099]  Aliff says that by 2012, using credit and debit cards should be cheaper and more convenient than cash.
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:57.125]  Some retailers could soon start surcharging customers if they choose to buy products with cash because of the great cost of processing these payments, he warned.
[02:36:57.565 --> 02:37:06.211]  Visa Europe briefed the British Retail Consortium last month on new contactless cards that can be waived in front of a scanner to make small payments.
[02:37:06.711 --> 02:37:12.875]  However, the consortium dismissed the vision and claimed that the card processing fees, as regulators are investigating, are still too high.
[02:37:13.256 --> 02:37:14.937]  Okay, so that's the move.
[02:37:14.977 --> 02:37:18.759]  I mean, I see TV ads, print ads going, cash is dirty, don't do it.
[02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:20.801]  Brought to you by the Department of Treasury.
[02:37:21.161 --> 02:37:22.942]  Brought to you by the Banking Association.
[02:37:22.982 --> 02:37:26.885]  Brought to you by the... Once they do this, they've got total control.
[02:37:26.925 --> 02:37:28.066]  They can shut off your cards.
[02:37:28.146 --> 02:37:29.567]  It kills the underground economy.
[02:37:30.254 --> 02:37:31.795]  Now you watch, they're still going to keep cash.
[02:37:31.855 --> 02:37:33.415]  It's just going to have RFID in it.
[02:37:33.475 --> 02:37:35.216]  It's going to be cashless, basically.
[02:37:35.696 --> 02:37:39.297]  But then they'll own the scanners so they can still keep shipping in their heroin and cocaine.
[02:37:39.317 --> 02:37:43.419]  The only thing holding it back is the government dealing the smack and the flake.
[02:37:44.539 --> 02:37:46.100]  Because they're a loving government.
[02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:47.240]  It's so good.
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:49.101]  Oh, they care about us.
[02:37:49.201 --> 02:37:50.221]  Oh, I love the government.
[02:37:50.301 --> 02:37:51.482]  Oh, I've been wrong.
[02:37:51.622 --> 02:37:53.002]  I'm just, oh, it's so good.
[02:37:54.663 --> 02:37:56.343]  Folks, I'm just getting really sick of things.
[02:37:56.403 --> 02:37:57.804]  I'd hope you understand that right now.
[02:38:01.147 --> 02:38:02.429]  I'm just getting really aggressive.
[02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:06.974]  Newly unearthed footage exposes 9-1-1 media scripting.
[02:38:10.063 --> 02:38:14.867]  Now, this story is important, this story is big, and I should have spent the whole first hour on this.
[02:38:14.927 --> 02:38:39.285]  I'm begging you to go to PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com, Infowars.com, and to get this report, and to get it now, and to get it out to everybody you know, because this is as big as the Building 7 BBC report, where they reported it had fallen long before it did fall, and they tried to cover up of claiming that, oh, we've lost all the videotapes, and take that down, and you're not allowed to show that.
[02:38:40.493 --> 02:38:45.858]  Well, other videos have been dug up that we don't even have time to play today.
[02:38:46.038 --> 02:38:47.019]  We'll try to play some of it.
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:56.969]  Newly unearthed footage exposes 9-11 media scripting, bizarre foreknowledge, an explanation of towers collapse, more cryptic clairvoyance.
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:00.821]  by Paul Joseph Waddlewott.
[02:39:01.362 --> 02:39:21.193]  It says, yet more archived news footage unearthed from broadcast on 9-1-1 offers further evidence that the media were being fed a script in which a cover story was quickly groomed to offset questions about the highly suspicious collapse of the Twin Towers.
[02:39:21.855 --> 02:39:31.802]  Two weeks ago we highlighted the BBC World footage from September 11th in which a correspondent reports the collapse of Building 7 as it remains standing and the live shot behind her.
[02:39:32.262 --> 02:39:39.447]  New footage unearthed by Britain's Channel 5 News coverage provides more questions about 9-11 scripting in a similar vein.
[02:39:40.985 --> 02:39:43.846]  Sections of the other tower are also crumbling.
[02:39:44.226 --> 02:39:59.452]  Now, the reason this is happening, according to the website from the World Trade Center, is they're actually telling us that the structure, the outside cladding of the building, is integral to the safety and security of it, states the news anchor, following the collapse of the South Tower.
[02:40:00.172 --> 02:40:07.595]  Once you penetrate, apparently, the very structure of the building is under threat, and that's why one of the towers has already collapsed.
[02:40:08.743 --> 02:40:15.768]  Here they are with the official pancake outer lattice cladding story that's been totally disproven, by the way.
[02:40:15.808 --> 02:40:17.129]  Even the government's backed off that now.
[02:40:18.129 --> 02:40:19.090]  They're giving other reasons.
[02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:23.593]  I mean, they're putting this out before it even happens, like everything else.
[02:40:25.475 --> 02:40:36.282]  The suspicious rapidity of the instant press release aside, why did the World Trade Center website carry such a blatantly fallacious explanation for the collapse of the first tower?
[02:40:38.823 --> 02:40:44.905]  Even the layman knows that any modern building is anchored by core columns, not outside cladding, and that the Twin Towers were no different.
[02:40:45.625 --> 02:40:52.468]  To rest a building's integrity on its outside cladding is a reversal of all commonly accepted architectural knowledge.
[02:40:52.628 --> 02:40:59.490]  Why was the World Trade Center website peddling this nonsense in contradiction with the words of the Twin Towers' own designers?
[02:40:59.930 --> 02:41:01.891]  Then the Port Authority, based in Building 7,
[02:41:03.078 --> 02:41:06.925]  From the end of the pier, they'd moved out because of doing a drill of a terror attack the night before.
[02:41:06.945 --> 02:41:09.130]  We're telling everybody it was okay to stay at their desk.
[02:41:09.190 --> 02:41:09.971]  That's now been confirmed.
[02:41:09.991 --> 02:41:11.314]  We should add that little tidbit.
[02:41:12.356 --> 02:41:12.816]  Including...
[02:41:13.951 --> 02:41:16.513]  Included is over a dozen examples compiled here.
[02:41:16.593 --> 02:41:25.121]  Frank A. Demartini, one site construction manager at the World Trade Center, said the towers could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners without collapsing.
[02:41:25.441 --> 02:41:37.192]  In addition, Leslie Robertson, one of the two original structural engineers at the World Trade Center, said that the Twin Towers were, in fact, the first structures outside the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airplane.
[02:41:37.941 --> 02:41:43.065]  The Twin Towers were designed to absorb airliner impacts by means of their 47 huge core columns.
[02:41:43.405 --> 02:41:47.448]  The Twin Towers could not be compromised simply by damaging their outside cladding.
[02:41:48.449 --> 02:41:55.374]  Such a claim is patently absurd and why it wasn't immediately peddled as an explanation for the collapse is highly suspect.
[02:41:55.935 --> 02:42:02.400]  And now folks are finding all these guys that are clearly government operatives and Harley Davidson shirts and baseball caps going, it's incredible!
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:03.861]  I saw both planes hit!
[02:42:04.281 --> 02:42:07.704]  And now the structures are very damaged and they're going to be collapsing!
[02:42:10.154 --> 02:42:13.880]  I mean, you just see them there setting it up, man, and they think we're so stupid.
[02:42:15.522 --> 02:42:16.203]  It goes on and on.
[02:42:16.243 --> 02:42:18.466]  It's a long article, and it gives a bunch of examples.
[02:42:20.709 --> 02:42:21.991]  Let's play part of the first clip.
[02:42:22.011 --> 02:42:24.875]  I got like five clips here, but let's just play the first clip.
[02:42:24.895 --> 02:42:25.156]  Here it is.
[02:42:26.129 --> 02:42:29.591]  Programming in Russia, in Germany, in Japan has all been stopped.
[02:42:29.631 --> 02:42:31.693]  They're taking these live pictures.
[02:42:32.333 --> 02:42:36.275]  The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has said we can only imagine the terror.
[02:42:36.315 --> 02:42:39.077]  He broke into his TUC.
[02:42:39.097 --> 02:42:41.679]  He was due to address the TUC conference today.
[02:42:42.359 --> 02:42:49.682]  He broke off from what was to have been his address to give his deepest condolences to President George Bush and the American people.
[02:42:49.702 --> 02:42:56.265]  The Prime Minister said the attacks were acts of fanatics who are utterly indifferent to the sanctity of life.
[02:42:56.445 --> 02:42:59.786]  Such terrorism is the new evil in our world today.
[02:43:00.626 --> 02:43:05.768]  And it's the duty of democracies to come together and fight it together to eradicate this evil completely from our world.
[02:43:05.808 --> 02:43:07.869]  Those are the words of Mr Blair today.
[02:43:07.909 --> 02:43:11.670]  We're seeing now the live picture of the World Trade Center.
[02:43:11.770 --> 02:43:17.052]  We understand that one of the Twin Towers has collapsed entirely.
[02:43:17.512 --> 02:43:20.153]  We have eyewitness accounts of the incident.
[02:43:21.076 --> 02:43:32.700]  Then, like, 20 minutes after, I just saw another plane coming on the backside, making a huge turn, and then hitting the other tower.
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:35.381]  Where was the first plane coming from?
[02:43:35.501 --> 02:43:36.041]  From north.
[02:43:37.101 --> 02:43:39.342]  What did the plane look like?
[02:43:40.082 --> 02:43:42.083]  Like a 737, like a jet plane.
[02:43:43.764 --> 02:43:47.765]  Like a jet plane, I mean, like a normal plane, commercial plane.
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:58.244]  We've got a problem with the pictures there, but what we can see is that sections of the other tower are also crumbling.
[02:43:58.544 --> 02:44:07.770]  Now the reason this is happening, according to the website for the World Trade Centre, they're actually telling us that the structure, the outside cladding of this building is integral to the safety and security of it.
[02:44:07.870 --> 02:44:13.114]  Once you penetrate that apparently the very structure of the building is under threat and that's why one tower has already collapsed.
[02:44:13.574 --> 02:44:17.697]  What we can see is that sections of the other tower are also crumbling.
[02:44:17.997 --> 02:44:27.243]  Now the reason this is happening, according to the website of the World Trade Center, they're actually telling us that the structure, the outside cladding of this building is integral to the safety and security of it.
[02:44:27.323 --> 02:44:32.227]  Once you penetrate that apparently, the very structure of the building... Okay, she goes on to repeat it more.
[02:44:32.947 --> 02:44:35.249]  Uh, nothing had collapsed on the other tower.
[02:44:36.570 --> 02:44:41.193]  And they're just, they're just, oh, the World Trade Center website is telling us
[02:44:43.811 --> 02:44:46.372]  The firemen all ran in because they knew these buildings didn't fall.
[02:44:47.473 --> 02:44:48.654]  They knew it never happened before.
[02:44:50.235 --> 02:44:51.716]  Let's play some of the next clip.
[02:44:52.456 --> 02:44:53.577]  Here's part of the next clip.
[02:44:53.597 --> 02:44:56.639]  And then I witnessed both towers collapse.
[02:44:56.799 --> 02:44:57.980]  One first and then the second.
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:01.122]  Mostly due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense.
[02:45:02.427 --> 02:45:14.338]  It just won the velocity of the plane and the fact that they would have a plane filled with fuel hitting that building that burned and you had that intense heat probably weaken the structure as well.
[02:45:15.219 --> 02:45:20.864]  And I think it was simply the planes hitting the buildings.
[02:45:22.191 --> 02:45:23.792]  Poised to strike again.
[02:45:23.872 --> 02:45:27.134]  Immensely wealthy man and a very private man.
[02:45:27.214 --> 02:45:31.956]  He has been granted a safe haven by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
[02:45:32.796 --> 02:45:42.081]  And during his time in hiding, he has called for a holy war against the United States and specifically for the killing of Americans and Jews.
[02:45:42.873 --> 02:45:51.000]  Based on what you know, and I recognize we're dealing with so few facts, is it possible that just a plane crash could have collapsed these buildings, or would it have required the sort of
[02:46:07.615 --> 02:46:10.296]  Prior positioning of other explosives in the building, what do you think?
[02:46:10.357 --> 02:46:22.863]  No, my sense is that it just won the velocity of the plane and the fact that they have a plane filled with fuel hitting that building that burned the velocity of the plane.
[02:46:24.144 --> 02:46:36.490]  The reason these clips are important is it shows within 33 minutes they're saying Bin Laden did it, when we show the time on the screen, Bin Laden did it, oh we know why they fell, and these people, it's so staged.
[02:46:37.290 --> 02:46:41.993]  And then the second guy talking to Dan Rather, it turns out, is intimately involved in the whole operation.
[02:46:44.615 --> 02:46:47.177]  And so folks are just combing through all this scripting.
[02:46:47.217 --> 02:46:48.478]  There's a bunch of other examples.
[02:46:48.518 --> 02:46:50.320]  The article goes on for page after page.
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:59.006]  I'm telling everybody out there, you've absolutely got to go to PrisonPlanet.com and get the story concerning the scripting and send this out to folks.
[02:47:00.521 --> 02:47:03.043]  Because this is just one more nail in the coffin of these people.
[02:47:03.104 --> 02:47:09.910]  There's a bunch of clips, not just clips where they're saying bombs are going off, but there's bombs, but the clips where they're explaining.
[02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:15.355]  In fact, we've got clips where they're saying they're going to collapse before even the first tower fell.
[02:47:17.177 --> 02:47:20.380]  And we've got them saying after the first tower fell, why the second was going to fall.
[02:47:22.225 --> 02:47:26.507]  And putting out the scientifically false cover story for Minute One.
[02:47:26.548 --> 02:47:33.531]  This is just one more ingredient to all the evidence we have to this potluck stew that we put together here.
[02:47:36.013 --> 02:47:39.615]  Now, we're going to come back in the final segment and take your calls.
[02:47:39.635 --> 02:47:40.815]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[02:47:40.835 --> 02:47:45.218]  I'm going to rampage through Joe, John, Greg, and Paul's calls.
[02:47:47.245 --> 02:47:51.587]  But before I end this segment, do not procrastinate, do not wait.
[02:47:51.708 --> 02:48:03.174]  Go to Infowars.com today and get America Freedom to Fascism, get Lou Shane's second edition, get my new film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:48:03.594 --> 02:48:04.374]  Do not wait.
[02:48:04.475 --> 02:48:08.897]  Get a history of government-sponsored terrorism today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:09.297 --> 02:48:10.098]  Take action.
[02:48:10.758 --> 02:48:11.118]  Get it.
[02:48:11.178 --> 02:48:11.959]  Make copies.
[02:48:12.039 --> 02:48:13.099]  It's so effective.
[02:48:13.139 --> 02:48:13.820]  Put it on AXS TV.
[02:48:14.941 --> 02:48:19.265]  The film starts with all the admitted examples where our government admits they've staged terror attacks.
[02:48:19.765 --> 02:48:22.247]  Then it gets into 9-11, 7-7, and a lot more.
[02:48:23.328 --> 02:48:26.550]  Toll-free number to order, 888-253-3139.
[02:48:26.570 --> 02:48:26.951]  888-253-3139.

[02:48:36.078 --> 02:48:39.861]  Great activist tool to download them and share them at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:40.161 --> 02:48:41.622]  We'll be back with the final segment.
[02:48:41.642 --> 02:48:42.123]  Stay with us.
[02:48:48.937 --> 02:48:52.081]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.442 --> 02:48:54.404]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.765 --> 02:49:02.415]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.095 --> 02:49:10.157]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.538 --> 02:49:21.941]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.281 --> 02:49:26.183]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.243 --> 02:49:28.163]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.504 --> 02:49:32.365]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:29.637 --> 02:52:31.598]  Alright, let's quickly go to the calls.
[02:52:31.678 --> 02:52:33.879]  Joe in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:52:34.479 --> 02:52:35.440]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:36.080]  Good sir.
[02:52:36.200 --> 02:52:37.141]  I wanted to thank you.
[02:52:37.161 --> 02:52:41.383]  I was the one that sent you that unearthed footage of the
[02:52:42.518 --> 02:52:43.478]  I don't know.
[02:53:01.778 --> 02:53:04.118]  It was awesome that you put it on, and I'm so happy about that.
[02:53:04.319 --> 02:53:06.959]  Well, you get the credit, and others like you, my friend.
[02:53:07.279 --> 02:53:08.299]  I wanted to read something.
[02:53:08.339 --> 02:53:13.360]  I know you're working on a new film, and you talk about, you know, convincing people of this North American Union.
[02:53:13.780 --> 02:53:22.362]  I'm going to just read something really quick from a book called The Fundamental Laws, a report of the 68th Convocation of the Rose Cross Order.
[02:53:22.662 --> 02:53:23.782]  You know who the Rosicrucians are?
[02:53:23.822 --> 02:53:24.043]  Yes.
[02:53:24.243 --> 02:53:26.143]  It's written by R. Swinburne Clymer.
[02:53:26.696 --> 02:53:28.317]  And it was written in July 6th of 1916.
[02:53:28.797 --> 02:53:28.317]  1916.
[02:53:28.937 --> 02:53:32.280]  Read it fast, we gotta go.
[02:53:32.700 --> 02:53:40.725]  America is not complete and will not be complete until Mexico is again part of America as she was in the long ago and when Mexico is once again a part of the United States.
[02:53:41.245 --> 02:53:46.789]  Then, then will the capstone have been set on the pyramid and the reverse side of the United States seal will be cut out.
[02:53:48.030 --> 02:53:49.971]  It will be done without the shedding of blood.
[02:53:50.651 --> 02:53:53.333]  Now I know you were raised in Taunton, Texas.
[02:53:53.855 --> 02:53:54.215]  Yeah, Alex?
[02:54:23.214 --> 02:54:29.520]  Quickly, what I want to tell you, you know, you can't argue about the free fall of the building, yet these people can't see it.
[02:54:30.961 --> 02:54:33.743]  You've got these people calling in, talking about how old the Earth is.
[02:54:34.384 --> 02:54:45.854]  They're put plutonium halos in granite all over the world that only had a half-life of three and a half minutes, and they can't explain how that could possibly be in granite that had to cool for thousands of millions of years.
[02:54:46.154 --> 02:54:50.858]  God created this thing just the way it says in the Bible, and they're finding that out in science now.
[02:54:51.318 --> 02:54:58.324]  But I don't know how in the world you'll ever convince these idiots out here that those buildings came down naturally.
[02:54:59.905 --> 02:55:02.608]  And my own son, I have trouble selling the idea on.
[02:55:02.648 --> 02:55:05.450]  He understands the one world order, but we can't get him to see the other.
[02:55:06.411 --> 02:55:09.093]  Well, it's scary to admit that, George, and I appreciate your call.
[02:55:09.173 --> 02:55:10.214]  Paul in Ohio.
[02:55:10.234 --> 02:55:10.654]  Go ahead.
[02:55:11.975 --> 02:55:12.296]  Hello.
[02:55:12.556 --> 02:55:12.876]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:13.156 --> 02:55:13.517]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:13.837 --> 02:55:14.057]  Hi.
[02:55:14.217 --> 02:55:16.739]  Yeah, you know, with all this stuff coming out about Building 7,
[02:55:18.208 --> 02:55:22.151]  The family members and the truthers should be going to that Manhattan D.A.
[02:55:22.211 --> 02:55:27.295]  and say, look, we demand that you indict Silverstein for insurance fraud.
[02:55:27.335 --> 02:55:29.696]  Listen, they've sued the D.A.'
[02:55:29.656 --> 02:55:30.137]  's office.
[02:55:30.177 --> 02:55:32.558]  They've had petitions.
[02:55:32.598 --> 02:55:33.119]  They've tried.
[02:55:33.959 --> 02:55:36.901]  Yeah, I mean, it's a slam-dunk case of insurance fraud.
[02:55:36.921 --> 02:55:39.504]  Forget the thousand or so other laws he's violated.
[02:55:39.524 --> 02:55:44.167]  I mean, I guarantee you, if you get that weasel on the stand, he's gonna spill his guts.
[02:55:44.548 --> 02:55:47.550]  Well, if he actually got indicted for something like that, he'd have a heart attack.
[02:55:47.610 --> 02:55:51.273]  I mean, you know, just like whenever the head of Enron was about to go to prison.
[02:55:51.433 --> 02:55:52.254]  Oh, he died.
[02:55:52.714 --> 02:55:53.435]  Thank you for the call.
[02:55:53.475 --> 02:55:54.976]  George in Florida, you're our tail gunner.
[02:55:55.016 --> 02:55:55.817]  Take us out of here.
[02:55:55.837 --> 02:56:00.580]  Uh, yes, Alex, um, my, um, I'd like to know, you don't have a quip on this.
[02:56:00.701 --> 02:56:03.663]  When they had these two French document, documentaires, uh,
[02:56:04.699 --> 02:56:12.941]  Yeah, well, anyway, uh, when one of they first entered the tower, uh, there was a person engulfed in flames.
[02:56:12.961 --> 02:56:20.003]  They wouldn't put the camera on it, and they said, jet fuel went down the elevator shaft, so... But they can't because the elevators are staggered.
[02:56:20.023 --> 02:56:20.984]  They don't go straight down.
[02:56:21.364 --> 02:56:22.504]  Call me back tomorrow about it.
[02:56:22.544 --> 02:56:23.724]  God bless you all!
