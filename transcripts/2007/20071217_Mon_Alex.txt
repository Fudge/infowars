[00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:06.614]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:08.335]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:10.136]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:11.597]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:13.238]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.578 --> 00:00:17.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:22.243]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:32.289]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.829]  Welcome.
[00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:34.430]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:37.528]  We are live.
[00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:39.229]  It is the 17th day of December 2007.
[00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.213]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:46.294]  It is 11 a.m.
[00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:47.836]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:47.916]  11 a.m.
[00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:49.317]  and 52 seconds.
[00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:52.599]  12 noon and 56 seconds Eastern Standard Time.
[00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:02.860]  We're going to have wide-open phones throughout the three-hour broadcast today.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:13.383]  We're going to have different individuals from the Ron Paul 2008 presidential campaign popping in to give their analysis of what happened yesterday.
[00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:26.968]  Well over, the way I count it, well over $6.3 million raised, shattering John Kerry's previous record, and then even more money
[00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:40.405]  Even more money came in after that in the early morning hours, but I guess the only amount that counts in the big drive for the money bomb is what came in in that 24-hour period.
[00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:44.927]  There I was doing a radio interview at 11 p.m.
[00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:47.789]  Central, which was midnight Eastern when the money bomb started.
[00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:52.245]  Saturday evening, and I watched it in the first hour, it raised more than $500,000.
[00:01:53.726 --> 00:02:01.351]  And, of course, it slowed in the early morning hours, picking back up at about 8 a.m., and just absolute history made.
[00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:12.579]  But I have noticed there's been a lot less media coverage, it's still substantive, on Congressman Ron Paul and his second success with the population of this country.
[00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.052]  But this is a victory anyway.
[00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:16.473]  You cut it.
[00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:19.855]  Ron Paul has won either way by taking action.
[00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:25.258]  The people have won by getting in the arena and showing what the Graffridge can do.
[00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:31.521]  Not only does this break any previous fundraising record, he stands at $18,212,183 right now.
[00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:36.893]  $18,212,183 and change.
[00:02:36.993 --> 00:02:41.596]  And then I can hit refresh and it'll just continue to climb up from there every time I reload the page.
[00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:58.458]  So we're going to be discussing this today, and the media spin, the attack pieces that are coming out.
[00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:10.266]  But more than just attack pieces, they're just censoring him in polls, not adding him to the polls, and then saying he doesn't show up in polls, knowing that a large portion of the public is very simple and weak-minded.
[00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:13.389]  But they're starting to pick up on the deception.
[00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:22.215]  And they do other things, like cheat at the straw polls, publicly, even under the watchful eye of alternative and mainstream
[00:03:23.184 --> 00:03:24.149]  News Cameras!
[00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:28.656]  This is the type of thing they're doing, and we've talked about that ad nauseum.
[00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:32.238]  You know, we had Rand Paul, Dr. Rand Paul, Ron Paul's son, last week.
[00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:47.347]  Steve Watson's doing a report today about that interview, pointing out that, yes, Rand Paul said that election fraud is a big problem, and now Liberty supporters need to watch the polls and need to learn about the different techniques of fraud to try to frustrate and block that.
[00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:53.691]  Or, if it starts taking place in Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan, and other places, being able to report on it
[00:03:54.891 --> 00:03:57.694]  So that we can dampen it happening in other states.
[00:03:58.815 --> 00:04:03.139]  All part of a larger strategy to expose this.
[00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:09.404]  But regardless, we're winning in that more people are waking up to the message of liberty than ever before.
[00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:12.186]  I am going to talk about a fact, though.
[00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:20.634]  There are a lot of mainline Republicans in the Ron Paul Revolution who are attempting to create an orthodoxy and push an orthodoxy of mainline, kind of,
[00:04:21.693 --> 00:04:31.622]  Semi-neoconism and trying to herd people to where supposedly Ron Paul supporters aren't even supposed to talk about issues that Ron Paul talks about.
[00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:38.608]  Like the North American Union or Ron Paul talking about how there is a danger of them trying to assassinate him.
[00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.571]  They say that's unorthodox, you're not supposed to discuss it.
[00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:47.056]  So we'll discuss strategies too to not compromise ourselves as a movement
[00:04:47.894 --> 00:04:55.777]  And, uh, get watered down in some quest, uh, to earn political brownie points with the mainline zombie America.
[00:04:56.477 --> 00:05:00.499]  Being hardcore is what's gonna wake people up.
[00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:03.360]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.481]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:10.243]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[00:05:10.323 --> 00:05:12.864]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:05:13.064 --> 00:05:16.085]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.713 --> 00:05:19.157]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:27.209]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:35.197]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.698 --> 00:05:39.160]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.062]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.102 --> 00:05:43.083]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:44.043]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.063 --> 00:05:45.124]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:45.764]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.784 --> 00:05:47.025]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:02.549]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.394]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.

[00:07:17.323 --> 00:07:20.927]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:21.567]  I think so.
[00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:54.854]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:07:54.894 --> 00:07:56.537]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:08:06.138 --> 00:08:10.341]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.982 --> 00:08:11.802]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.563 --> 00:08:13.624]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:18.107]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.307 --> 00:08:22.430]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.573 --> 00:08:36.754]  Again, it is December 17, 2007.
[00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:43.860]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours and 53 minutes.
[00:08:46.542 --> 00:08:51.385]  Let me just run through some of the news I have here in front of me today in the stack.
[00:08:52.046 --> 00:08:53.227]  Greenspan sees
[00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:55.663]  Early signs of U.S.
[00:08:55.863 --> 00:08:57.184]  stagflation.
[00:08:57.284 --> 00:08:57.824]  That's right.
[00:08:58.164 --> 00:09:00.445]  We haven't seen that since the late 1970s.
[00:09:01.046 --> 00:09:02.126]  Very, very painful.
[00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:04.347]  We have been in a recession for a year.
[00:09:04.407 --> 00:09:07.929]  They're finally getting around to saying a recession is starting.
[00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.953]  Also, Ron Paul smashes record with over 6 million plus hauled.
[00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:18.966]  Bookmakers hit mark with Ron Paul money bomb bet.
[00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:23.348]  Yeah, Vegas said that he would raise a little over six million.
[00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:24.709]  Vegas was right.
[00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:27.870]  Because Vegas will be out of business if they're not right.
[00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:30.752]  The house has always got to be right, I guess.
[00:09:31.192 --> 00:09:35.474]  Ron Paul surpasses fundraising record held by John Kerry.
[00:09:36.235 --> 00:09:38.215]  Another story here by Nolan Chart.
[00:09:38.315 --> 00:09:41.776]  How Ron Paul has already won, and I agree with their analysis.
[00:09:42.336 --> 00:09:44.217]  Here's some of the other news we're going to cover today.
[00:09:44.257 --> 00:09:45.817]  It can't all just be Ron Paul.
[00:09:46.717 --> 00:09:50.098]  Iraq sees need for foreign troops for 10 years.
[00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:52.698]  The globalists put a puppet government in.
[00:09:52.738 --> 00:09:56.499]  The public government then says, oh, we need you here for another 10 years.
[00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:58.399]  They'll never leave, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:00.040]  That was the plan before it started.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.001]  Washington Post reports synthetic DNA on the brink of yielding new life forms.
[00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:14.594]  I want to talk a little bit about synthetic viruses and a lot more today on this subject, because this is really the big issue.
[00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:18.996]  Also, another story from George Washington Block, spot up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:19.316 --> 00:10:22.758]  Government's evasiveness about 9-11 is proof of guilt.
[00:10:23.578 --> 00:10:27.940]  Getting back to the election, Ohio election officials calls machines flawed.
[00:10:28.693 --> 00:10:31.355]  Well, flawed means that they have a problem.
[00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:33.456]  Flawed means they're not working properly.
[00:10:33.536 --> 00:10:34.917]  No, they're not flawed.
[00:10:34.937 --> 00:10:36.498]  They're designed to steal elections.
[00:10:36.778 --> 00:10:37.919]  They're working quite nicely.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.142]  Wider spying fuels aid plan for telecom industry.
[00:10:43.183 --> 00:10:44.824]  Now this is the New York Times today.
[00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:57.672]  Remember how in 1996 and since then I told you it was public that nine billion dollars was paid to the big five telecoms.
[00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:12.863]  Just to them, another billion or so was paid out to some of the smaller ones to make entire floors or entire sections of buildings actual NSA offices manned by National Security Agency employees.
[00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:20.231]  Because they had to get funding, and it was all in the legislation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
[00:11:20.991 --> 00:11:30.938]  So I'd go on air for years, and people would say, oh, it's a conspiracy, the government's not spying on us, and I'd say, they don't tap your phones, they are the phone company.
[00:11:31.938 --> 00:11:43.626]  Well, now they want all the internet and everything else completely controlled, and they just need more funds in there to fully spy on everything continually, not just store it, but have actual people watching it in real time and scanning it.
[00:11:44.435 --> 00:11:53.982]  And so here it is in public view again, New York Times, saying, yeah, they want to fund the infrastructure expansion, and the telecoms want a bigger payoff.
[00:11:56.504 --> 00:11:59.166]  And we're still having a debate about whether they spy on you?
[00:11:59.206 --> 00:12:00.527]  Of course they spy on you.
[00:12:01.067 --> 00:12:13.136]  I mean, listeners, the average Joe Schmo, mainline Republicans, mainline Democrats, if you own a small factory, if you're a telecommunications person yourself, or you're an inventor,
[00:12:14.182 --> 00:12:17.866]  You don't just have computers listening and recording when they hear a key word.
[00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:24.412]  By the way, 80 plus percent of it isn't bombs, al-Qaeda, talk like that, that gets the computers to turn on.
[00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:30.538]  They're already listening, but they only record limited stuff because they don't want to have to collate and go through all the data.
[00:12:30.638 --> 00:12:33.521]  If you own a business, a Fortune 5000 company,
[00:12:35.405 --> 00:12:37.286]  You've got a company worth a couple hundred million dollars.
[00:12:37.306 --> 00:12:38.767]  You've got a company worth ten million dollars.
[00:12:39.088 --> 00:12:41.749]  But it's in key areas of infrastructure.
[00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:45.732]  You have actionable analysts listening, not just computers.
[00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:55.358]  You have people assigned to you in the 16-plus agencies and the 20-plus other secretive agencies that we know are there as sub-directorates and the private corporate systems.
[00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:58.060]  And it's all being watched, okay?
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.582]  You know, these idiots always say, well, I have nothing to hide.
[00:13:01.622 --> 00:13:02.523]  I'm not a terrorist.
[00:13:02.963 --> 00:13:04.064]  I don't care if they're listening.
[00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:09.443]  There have been lawsuits in the international courts, hundreds of them that I know of, that means there must be thousands.
[00:13:09.903 --> 00:13:14.246]  There have been court cases and debates in the European Parliament, in the British Parliament.
[00:13:14.606 --> 00:13:31.814]  There have been think tank discussions at Nauseam, where companies, in fact most companies that are not in the inner circle of the globalist system, but that are prominent, there are a few that are still privately owned, that are leaders, but they get moles in them and the rest of it.
[00:13:33.024 --> 00:13:42.834]  They send their data through tubes, you know, when you go to the bank and you put your driver's license and your deposit slip or checks in the tube and it sucks it by air.
[00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:50.042]  There's a lot of offices across the planet, in fact the entire French government does this with anything classified, and it goes by tube!
[00:13:50.983 --> 00:13:56.108]  You see, because anyone who has half a brain or owns a real company
[00:13:56.918 --> 00:13:57.439]  No, it's not.
[00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:23.041]  They are listening for terror chatter, but only to block police and other sub-directorates in the agencies that are compartmentalized and aren't part of the rogue government, only to keep them from stopping the cocaine shipments.
[00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:37.991]  You see, they know when the DEA, they know when the FBI, they know when the local police are about to bust a huge coke dealer, and when the establishment that doesn't want them busted because they're paying their cut and laundering their money through big banks,
[00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:40.053]  I mean, there's been thousands of cases of this.
[00:14:40.093 --> 00:14:41.215]  Police have written books about it.
[00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:43.477]  Every time they go to bust them, they've been tipped off.
[00:14:44.138 --> 00:14:45.960]  Not just moles in the police department.
[00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:47.242]  Not just... No!
[00:14:47.642 --> 00:14:57.735]  NSA, whole divisions, the NSA delivers and pipelines this to hundreds of mainline companies that have their own private divisions, and it all goes directly to them.
[00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:08.234]  The only time you catch a CIA aircraft with cocaine is when it runs out of gas in a storm and crashes with 3.3 tons of coke, as it did a few weeks ago.
[00:15:08.254 --> 00:15:11.015]  When it came out last week, it happened in September.
[00:15:11.555 --> 00:15:12.135]  Late September.
[00:15:12.873 --> 00:15:13.754]  That's the only time.
[00:15:13.854 --> 00:15:19.419]  Or when DEA agents, who are good, are smart enough not to tell their higher-ups.
[00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:26.506]  They get the local police in Tampa, Florida, or in South Texas, or Rockwall, Texas, to go ahead and raid it.
[00:15:26.646 --> 00:15:29.188]  And they raid it, and the CIA flashes badges.
[00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.370]  If the cops get up on you, they'll just pull guns.
[00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:36.074]  They'll have a couple special ops guys jump out of the back with their MP5s.
[00:15:37.632 --> 00:15:42.475]  And the cops are told to get down on the ground, there's been cases of this, and it's all swept under the rug.
[00:15:42.595 --> 00:15:42.875]  Okay?
[00:15:42.895 --> 00:15:45.377]  They bring their coke in, they bring their heroin in.
[00:15:45.397 --> 00:15:47.518]  And they're going to continue doing it.
[00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:48.779]  Alright?
[00:15:48.819 --> 00:15:49.779]  That's how this works.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.300]  Period.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.661]  End of story.
[00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:52.661]  End of debate.
[00:15:54.042 --> 00:15:54.963]  Alright, I already digressed.
[00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:56.423]  I said I was going to go through the news coming up.
[00:15:56.784 --> 00:16:02.307]  Cindy Sheehan says impeach Pelosi for collaboration with Bush administration on torture.
[00:16:04.288 --> 00:16:06.810]  San Francisco considers attacks on caffeine.
[00:16:08.424 --> 00:16:12.927]  They came out and said caffeine was bad, and the studies are six one way, half a dozen the other.
[00:16:12.947 --> 00:16:20.911]  It looks like moderate caffeine use via coffee is good for you, or tea, but heavy use is bad.
[00:16:20.971 --> 00:16:22.052]  Wow, that's most things.
[00:16:22.112 --> 00:16:24.894]  Moderation, as Benjamin Franklin said, is the key.
[00:16:26.054 --> 00:16:27.895]  But see, it's not about saving you from it.
[00:16:28.816 --> 00:16:32.738]  The government's trying to push Ritalin, Prozac, and a hundred other deadly drugs plush down your throat.
[00:16:33.278 --> 00:16:34.199]  They just want to tax it.
[00:16:34.219 --> 00:16:35.960]  So last week when I saw that they wanted to
[00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:39.281]  Uh, quote, have an investigation of the wickedness of caffeine.
[00:16:39.301 --> 00:16:40.462]  I said, here comes the tax.
[00:16:41.282 --> 00:16:43.864]  Anything you want, they'll probably legalize it.
[00:16:44.284 --> 00:16:45.365]  And then they'll ship it in.
[00:16:45.665 --> 00:16:49.348]  I mean, that's how they operate.
[00:16:50.048 --> 00:16:57.053]  The big cocaine and heroin dealers, uh, the big companies that had a monopoly in the 1920s lost their monopoly when it was over the counter.
[00:16:57.334 --> 00:17:00.536]  So they just criminalized it and the price went up several thousand percent.
[00:17:02.477 --> 00:17:04.979]  Texas Ready's police state tech
[00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.833]  For possible hurricane evacuees, and when you really read this, this is for any emergency.
[00:17:10.313 --> 00:17:21.420]  This is what we had the Marines in 1999 on video from Operation Urban Warrior, one of literally hundreds of drills they've had just that year alone, and since each year they've done the same thing.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.823]  And they're there retina scanning you, putting you into databases.
[00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:27.745]  It's the exact same video they released of what they did in Fallujah.
[00:17:28.145 --> 00:17:29.706]  But they admit it's for America, too.
[00:17:30.686 --> 00:17:32.107]  And this is putting you into the camps.
[00:17:32.207 --> 00:17:39.932]  Well, they now have admitted that it's a martial law grid, and they're going to do this, just like the preachers almost two years ago on this show told you.
[00:17:40.112 --> 00:17:50.238]  We got the FEMA documents where they're training them that when there's a disaster to tell their flock to turn their guns in, go to FEMA camps, let their families be broken up, hand their children over.
[00:17:50.879 --> 00:17:52.279]  And now it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.000]  Now it's in the Dallas Morning News.
[00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.862]  Now it's in the Times-Picayune.
[00:17:56.402 --> 00:17:58.023]  And now Curt Nemo's written a story about it.
[00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:09.066]  But see, they just introduce it as, oh yeah, we're gonna frisk you and retina scan you and check you for criminal records and when we put you on the evacuation buses or when you go to the emergency centers.
[00:18:09.487 --> 00:18:14.549]  This was always planned, sounds reasonable, but it's been set up over a decade ago.
[00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.252]  Russia makes a first nuke shipment to Iran.
[00:18:20.312 --> 00:18:25.135]  The AP spins that headline, that's peaceful nuclear fissile material for their reactor.
[00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:27.056]  Cannot be used in weapons development.
[00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.594]  So that is just some of what is coming up today.
[00:18:32.614 --> 00:18:33.796]  I've got a big old stack of
[00:18:34.528 --> 00:18:35.669]  I do want to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:35.689 --> 00:18:37.390]  You know, I do a Sunday show at 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:44.735]  Central, and yesterday when I did go to calls, I was giving each caller about a minute and was actually behaving myself and moving quickly to the next person, and I liked the feel of it.
[00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:10.349]  So, just have your comments, your questions, your points ready on Ron Paul, on the economy, on the money bomb, on how you think the media is going to attack him and what the spin machine and the tech machine is going to do.
[00:19:10.729 --> 00:19:11.929]  I just think start ignoring him.
[00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:15.910]  They weren't really ready and didn't have the talking points out a few months ago to ignore Paul.
[00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.071]  They were trying, but now they're clearly doing it.
[00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:26.052]  This money bomb is probably getting about, from what I've scanned on Google and on television, about one-tenth the coverage his last money bomb did.
[00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:27.693]  He has a second money bomb.
[00:19:30.649 --> 00:19:37.135]  Over six billion dollars breaks all records, any record, shatters them all, and it's not getting as much attention.
[00:19:37.155 --> 00:19:37.355]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:37.475 --> 00:19:53.850]  The websites are TruthNews.us, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.com, WhatIsTheEndGame.com, MartialLaw901.info.com, ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.372]  Oh, we're launching more websites this week, by the way.
[00:19:56.652 --> 00:19:57.533]  The fight continues.
[00:20:02.518 --> 00:20:04.499]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:07.361]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:20:07.661 --> 00:20:15.985]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:19.107]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:20:19.948 --> 00:20:23.169]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.031]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:27.372]  Take action now!
[00:20:27.512 --> 00:20:31.414]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:20:31.854 --> 00:20:36.097]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:20:36.317 --> 00:20:39.519]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:20:39.639 --> 00:20:46.083]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:20:46.363 --> 00:20:48.604]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:20:48.644 --> 00:20:50.125]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:20:50.145 --> 00:20:51.365]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:06.173]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:11.257]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:12.859]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:16.382]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:21.807]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[00:21:22.067 --> 00:21:27.832]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Subcompany in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[00:21:28.152 --> 00:21:30.574]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[00:21:30.674 --> 00:21:32.976]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[00:21:33.196 --> 00:21:35.337]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[00:21:35.618 --> 00:21:36.598]  No harsh chemicals.
[00:21:36.819 --> 00:21:37.759]  No animal testing.
[00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:39.320]  I use them and love them.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.962]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:21:41.242 --> 00:21:42.383]  And I save big time.
[00:21:42.643 --> 00:21:44.244]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:44.504]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[00:21:44.544 --> 00:21:47.226]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[00:21:54.091 --> 00:22:00.653]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:06.635]  As the old saying goes, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
[00:22:06.815 --> 00:22:12.316]  But if you give him a Berkey system, you give him the ability to obtain purified water for a lifetime.
[00:22:12.616 --> 00:22:17.758]  This year, when giving Christmas gifts, instead of unwanted trinkets, give a meaningful and substantial gift.
[00:22:18.018 --> 00:22:23.020]  Berkey systems are ideal for every member of your family, especially the young ones in college.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:31.182]  Unlike other water filtration systems, Berkey purifiers are portable, they require no plumbing, and the elements don't have to be replaced every four to six months.
[00:22:31.582 --> 00:22:38.025]  Perfect for anyone on a tight budget, and more importantly, if there's an unexpected emergency, your loved ones will be prepared.
[00:22:38.345 --> 00:22:42.126]  That's because Berkey systems are able to purify raw, untreated water.
[00:22:42.546 --> 00:22:45.329]  Check out our Christmas specials at Berkeywater.com.
[00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:51.154]  With one of our quantity specials, you not only get a discount, but in one stop you can get gifts for the entire family.
[00:22:51.174 --> 00:22:53.136]  There's Berkeywater.com or call 888-03-4438.
[00:22:53.156 --> 00:22:53.517]  That's 888-03-4438.
[00:23:01.536 --> 00:23:03.597]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.217 --> 00:23:13.141]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:20.804]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:21.514 --> 00:23:27.017]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:27.498 --> 00:23:38.324]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:41.185]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:43.086]  For more information, call 702-953-0111.
[00:23:50.527 --> 00:23:52.488]  Strange days have come
[00:24:15.988 --> 00:24:16.888]  It's real simple.
[00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:28.313]  The globalists are making their move right now against free humanity.
[00:24:30.254 --> 00:24:32.255]  And so, of course, there's going to be a reaction to that.
[00:24:33.775 --> 00:24:35.136]  And they planned for that.
[00:24:35.196 --> 00:24:36.236]  They knew this was going to happen.
[00:24:36.256 --> 00:24:37.837]  They wrote about this decades ago.
[00:24:39.157 --> 00:24:45.200]  Look at the British Ministry of Defense 10-year projection and analysis
[00:24:46.274 --> 00:24:47.575]  That they just put out.
[00:24:48.955 --> 00:24:52.337]  Look at what they just reported on, what, four months ago.
[00:24:53.297 --> 00:24:57.919]  They talked about the people are going to hate the centralization of power, they're going to hate the loss of their liberty.
[00:24:58.419 --> 00:25:02.701]  As the global government forms, they're going to start resisting more and more.
[00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:10.124]  They basically said the governments of the world face Ceausescu, Romanian-type flash mob overthrows.
[00:25:11.172 --> 00:25:17.195]  And so, they then lay out a list of plans to deal with the population, including neutron bombs.
[00:25:18.076 --> 00:25:30.683]  Yeah, they just calmly talk about dropping neutron bombs on cities that don't damage any of the buildings or infrastructures, but kill all the life, and then don't really leave any radiation in the plants, and everything come back in just a matter of years.
[00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.264]  That's right!
[00:25:34.136 --> 00:25:35.697]  We ought to write more articles about that.
[00:25:36.137 --> 00:25:45.041]  You know, not just a 10-plus page London Guardian report about it, but did any of you actually go read the British Ministry of Defence 10-year projection?
[00:25:45.061 --> 00:25:47.242]  I mean, they're official, what they believe is going to happen.
[00:25:48.283 --> 00:25:52.205]  Ah, race-specific bio-weapons, neutron bombs to control populations.
[00:25:52.765 --> 00:25:54.986]  What a nice word, control populations.
[00:25:55.566 --> 00:25:59.848]  You're sitting there and a radiation blast comes through your house.
[00:26:00.589 --> 00:26:03.290]  You literally fall over dead.
[00:26:03.883 --> 00:26:05.444]  You literally fry.
[00:26:06.104 --> 00:26:08.785]  You literally fall over dead.
[00:26:09.265 --> 00:26:10.765]  You instantly die.
[00:26:12.166 --> 00:26:17.947]  Doesn't matter if you're in a bunker 200 feet beneath the ground, then you're just gonna get zapped and die in a couple days.
[00:26:19.468 --> 00:26:20.368]  Oh, that's real nice.
[00:26:21.949 --> 00:26:22.509]  That's real nice.
[00:26:22.729 --> 00:26:25.730]  And see, a lot of you out there listening are gonna go, that's wild, man.
[00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.691]  That's crazy sounding.
[00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:29.471]  That's not gonna happen.
[00:26:31.372 --> 00:26:32.092]  Oh, yes it is.
[00:26:34.944 --> 00:26:38.825]  And by, oh yes it is, they have it in place, they're discussing the use of it.
[00:26:38.865 --> 00:26:46.267]  I'm not saying they're going to do it, but some of you are saying that doesn't exist, or that isn't real, or those discussions aren't going on.
[00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:50.508]  Well, that's because you can't go read an official British government report.
[00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:53.909]  That's because you don't know about the eugenicists.
[00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:57.050]  That's because you don't understand who the global elite are.
[00:26:58.931 --> 00:27:04.935]  The situation we face makes movies like I Am Legend look tame in comparison.
[00:27:05.915 --> 00:27:10.998]  But it isn't going to be a pack of 500 million zombies running around.
[00:27:11.018 --> 00:27:13.580]  It'll just be people dropping dead.
[00:27:15.581 --> 00:27:18.003]  So I'm going to talk about this in the second hour.
[00:27:18.083 --> 00:27:21.605]  I mean, I really had incredible brainstorms last night.
[00:27:21.645 --> 00:27:27.268]  I got home at about 12.15 and I laid in bed until about 2.30 a.m.
[00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:31.496]  I'm not tired.
[00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:32.757]  I got up early.
[00:27:32.797 --> 00:27:33.757]  I'm really energized.
[00:27:34.878 --> 00:27:37.979]  And I just had what I call a quickening.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.942]  And I have these routinely, but this was the most intense I've ever had.
[00:27:43.002 --> 00:27:54.627]  Just massive brainstorm, increased understanding, just thousands of thoughts running through my mind every minute, complex combinations of how things interlock.
[00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.871]  Seeing the Globalist Plan clearer than I've ever seen it.
[00:27:58.211 --> 00:28:00.552]  Seeing the general population clearer than I've ever seen it.
[00:28:00.872 --> 00:28:04.073]  Seeing myself clearer than I've ever seen myself.
[00:28:04.793 --> 00:28:06.014]  Believe me, I don't like what I see.
[00:28:07.914 --> 00:28:11.135]  Just absolute brainstorm.
[00:28:11.996 --> 00:28:17.617]  Nothing magical, not a vision, not a... But I can see how people thousands of years ago would think these were visions.
[00:28:17.637 --> 00:28:18.978]  I mean, if you want to call it
[00:28:21.727 --> 00:28:22.468]  What's that song?
[00:28:22.548 --> 00:28:24.870]  I keep my... Oh, here it comes again.
[00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:25.791]  The Crystal Vision.
[00:28:26.131 --> 00:28:28.053]  I keep my visions to myself.
[00:28:29.134 --> 00:28:31.196]  Well, I don't keep my visions to myself.
[00:28:31.256 --> 00:28:46.231]  I mean, I had thousands of points, thousands of analysis datums integrated in to be able to go on air and say, I think they're going to attack the World Trade Center again, just like they attacked
[00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.872]  The World Trade Center in 1993, they'll probably blame it on one of their assets like Osama Bin Laden.
[00:28:55.514 --> 00:29:01.617]  And I need to dig up the original radio show, where I really did hour after hour, day after day, started on July 25th.
[00:29:02.237 --> 00:29:03.258]  Can somebody dig that up?
[00:29:03.278 --> 00:29:08.020]  You know, I had that in my garage the other day, but it looks like it's all messed up.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.703]  Before I could play it, I can't find it again because I took stuff to storage.
[00:29:13.783 --> 00:29:15.804]  I can't find a letter from Mark Kornke.
[00:29:15.844 --> 00:29:16.945]  He sent me from prison.
[00:29:17.987 --> 00:29:24.211]  We were busy digging through the garage and I was sticking stuff in boxes and then I went back and tried to find it and I can't find it.
[00:29:24.231 --> 00:29:32.235]  Alright, all that aside, we'll take your calls when we get back about the Ron Paul Money Bomb Revolution.
[00:29:32.255 --> 00:29:33.696]  Super good news.
[00:29:34.256 --> 00:29:36.358]  But then I'm going to get into the dark side of things.
[00:29:37.078 --> 00:29:40.320]  And if people can't face the dark side, it's going to win.
[00:29:41.169 --> 00:29:43.552]  If you can't face the enemy, we're gonna lose.
[00:29:44.113 --> 00:29:45.094]  It's really that simple.
[00:29:45.335 --> 00:29:47.878]  This is not the time to water down our approach.
[00:29:47.898 --> 00:29:48.539]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:52.684]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.145 --> 00:29:54.747]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:58.372]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.923 --> 00:30:07.410]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:07.851 --> 00:30:12.076]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:30:12.496 --> 00:30:19.365]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:26.512]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:26.832 --> 00:30:28.433]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:30:28.734 --> 00:30:31.917]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:34.659]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:30:34.959 --> 00:30:41.686]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:42.126 --> 00:30:44.807]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:30:45.067 --> 00:30:48.449]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[00:30:48.489 --> 00:30:48.849]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:48.869 --> 00:30:50.670]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[00:31:01.684 --> 00:31:02.325]  It's a fact.
[00:31:02.545 --> 00:31:10.031]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:31:10.151 --> 00:31:19.018]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:31:19.298 --> 00:31:29.826]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:31:30.086 --> 00:31:36.147]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:31:36.367 --> 00:31:41.388]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:46.049]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:31:46.209 --> 00:31:48.010]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.330]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.770]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.730]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:31:57.952 --> 00:32:00.954]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:32:03.295 --> 00:32:08.718]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:32:09.158 --> 00:32:13.880]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:32:14.281 --> 00:32:16.902]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:20.744]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:32:21.562 --> 00:32:25.884]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:29.506]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:32:30.126 --> 00:32:32.948]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:32:33.729 --> 00:32:35.890]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.010]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:38.070]  U.S.
[00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.091]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:32:40.111 --> 00:32:40.491]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:41.331]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:32:41.391 --> 00:32:41.871]  Ask for George.
[00:33:11.979 --> 00:33:26.111]  So to be clear, early in the next hour, I'm going to do about 20-30 minutes
[00:33:28.667 --> 00:33:37.809]  In the simplest way I can, I tend to digress off into proof and, you know, subsections of a larger picture I try to articulate.
[00:33:37.829 --> 00:33:48.572]  I'm going to try to just boil it down as simply as possible and talk about the nature of the New World Order, the nature of the general population, where we're going, some of the big threats that we face that are very real.
[00:33:51.533 --> 00:33:56.234]  And I'm also going to talk about the attack on free speech that's happening in this country.
[00:33:59.754 --> 00:34:04.478]  And where I see that going, because, you know, I don't talk a lot about it.
[00:34:04.518 --> 00:34:09.021]  Callers call in and they say, did you hear Michael Medved say you should be investigated or arrested again?
[00:34:10.042 --> 00:34:11.043]  Most of the time I say no.
[00:34:11.063 --> 00:34:12.344]  And they say, do you want an audio clip of it?
[00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:13.385]  And I go, not really.
[00:34:13.405 --> 00:34:18.209]  I mean, I probably heard one tenth of the threats and the calls for my arrest.
[00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:19.550]  I have heard him say it.
[00:34:22.792 --> 00:34:25.555]  I have dealt with him personally at the RNC.
[00:34:29.053 --> 00:34:31.834]  And he started screaming, are you saying the President is a terrorist?
[00:34:31.874 --> 00:34:33.935]  Are you saying he killed all those people?
[00:34:35.956 --> 00:34:37.696]  And yelling and trying to get me thrown out of there.
[00:34:39.897 --> 00:34:44.339]  Inside the RNC, an armed camp at Madison Square Garden with guys with machine guns everywhere.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:54.382]  What it's like to have Neil Bortz saying, I am like Timothy McVeigh and Charlie Manson.
[00:34:55.603 --> 00:34:58.224]  Oh yeah, I was driving to the store Saturday night
[00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:01.290]  And they have a best of, they play here locally.
[00:35:03.191 --> 00:35:08.974]  This is what Neal Bortz has decided is his best of, and it was attacking two people, Ron Paul and myself.
[00:35:09.954 --> 00:35:10.415]  Repeatedly.
[00:35:10.435 --> 00:35:11.895]  A lot of you may have heard it.
[00:35:12.716 --> 00:35:13.336]  Around the country.
[00:35:13.756 --> 00:35:15.457]  Either live when he did it, or this best of.
[00:35:16.618 --> 00:35:24.622]  And when you realize that they publicly are getting White House talking points, I mean, we always knew that, but now it's admitted since last year in the New York Times.
[00:35:24.642 --> 00:35:26.723]  I mean, they went there and admitted it and hit it in plain view.
[00:35:29.637 --> 00:35:30.497]  I mean, think about that.
[00:35:30.517 --> 00:35:33.138]  Think about having the White House telling people to go after you.
[00:35:33.378 --> 00:35:34.539]  You think that's a good feeling?
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.060]  I'm not whining here.
[00:35:39.881 --> 00:35:52.425]  Actually, I'm mad at myself for not even fully realizing the threat and how serious this is, and how wonderful this is at the same time, because it means that we are really having an effect on these people.
[00:35:53.025 --> 00:35:57.647]  It means that in my saga, in my quest, in my march,
[00:35:58.533 --> 00:36:02.494]  Against the New World Order, that I have done great, grievous harm to them.
[00:36:03.615 --> 00:36:04.655]  All because of you, though.
[00:36:05.155 --> 00:36:06.396]  Only because you took action.
[00:36:16.419 --> 00:36:16.759]  All right.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.400]  So, I'm going to do that coming up.
[00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:23.601]  Right now, we're opening the phones up about the Ron Paul Revolution.
[00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:24.982]  For those that don't know,
[00:36:26.503 --> 00:36:30.705]  It looks to me that Paul Watson reports 6.5 million raised.
[00:36:32.626 --> 00:36:32.986]  I don't know.
[00:36:33.087 --> 00:36:51.416]  It was 11,440,000 because I went to the store Saturday night, heard Neil Bortz threatening me, threatening people that support me.
[00:36:52.317 --> 00:36:52.917]  That's coming up.
[00:36:54.699 --> 00:37:09.431]  And then I got back to my computer at about 10.58 and I went to PrisonPlanet.com where Paul Watson had the live link showing, you know, the embed from the Ron Paul Presidential site showing the numbers going up, the live ticker.
[00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:18.958]  And I went and I checked that out right at midnight Eastern.
[00:37:18.978 --> 00:37:20.039]  11 here was midnight Eastern.
[00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:23.121]  And in one hour I watched it go up over 500,000.
[00:37:25.274 --> 00:37:32.640]  It went from $11,400,000 and something thou to over $12,000,000 in one hour.
[00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:34.121]  So that's over $500,000.
[00:37:37.003 --> 00:37:37.804]  Very exciting.
[00:37:38.885 --> 00:37:39.866]  $500,000 in one hour.
[00:37:41.227 --> 00:37:45.570]  And then I was working last night and quit paying attention when midnight rolled around.
[00:37:46.131 --> 00:37:49.153]  And so it was about an hour after midnight Easter when I finally looked.
[00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.315]  And, you know, right now it's
[00:37:53.385 --> 00:37:55.246]  Approaching 18 and a half million.
[00:37:57.428 --> 00:38:06.355]  But a lot of that was raised in the last 12 hours or so since the 16th ended.
[00:38:07.275 --> 00:38:15.681]  But Paul Watson was watching it, and the campaign is reporting that after the phone call donations as well went in, that it was over 6 mil.
[00:38:18.231 --> 00:38:22.292]  But it appears to be about 6.5 million raised in one day.
[00:38:22.692 --> 00:38:25.213]  The media keeps saying he raised over 2 million.
[00:38:25.233 --> 00:38:27.553]  I'm hearing that this morning, seeing it on TV.
[00:38:27.893 --> 00:38:30.454]  And some reports are honest and say, well, over 5 million.
[00:38:31.714 --> 00:38:33.055]  But see, that's another way they spin.
[00:38:33.555 --> 00:38:34.875]  Oh yeah, he broke records.
[00:38:34.915 --> 00:38:35.955]  He raised over 2 million.
[00:38:37.376 --> 00:38:39.836]  No, he raised over 6 million.
[00:38:40.576 --> 00:38:42.977]  And even the mainstream media admits he broke all previous records.
[00:38:43.237 --> 00:38:47.098]  See, before, with 4.3 million on the November 9th, November 5th money bomb,
[00:38:47.811 --> 00:38:50.174]  He only broke pre-primary records.
[00:38:51.656 --> 00:38:56.843]  Okay, now he's broken primary records and post-primary records.
[00:38:58.364 --> 00:38:59.165]  Shattered it.
[00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:02.470]  And I know you know that, but that's not even the issue here.
[00:39:03.351 --> 00:39:04.993]  If he raised a million dollars
[00:39:06.076 --> 00:39:10.099]  On average, these went down from $95 donations to about $45 donations.
[00:39:10.519 --> 00:39:11.580]  This is even more powerful.
[00:39:11.901 --> 00:39:14.663]  These are smaller donations of about $45 apiece, raising over $6 million in one day.
[00:39:14.683 --> 00:39:17.765]  People giving, on average, $40, $45, raising over $6 million in one day.
[00:39:17.805 --> 00:39:18.385]  That is the news.
[00:39:18.425 --> 00:39:20.607]  That is the issue.
[00:39:33.032 --> 00:39:34.093]  All right, I said I'd take your calls.
[00:39:34.113 --> 00:39:35.094]  We're going to go quickly to them.
[00:39:35.214 --> 00:39:36.855]  Eric in California, you're on the air.
[00:39:36.895 --> 00:39:37.295]  Go ahead.
[00:39:37.315 --> 00:39:40.638]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:39:40.758 --> 00:39:41.438]  Hello, go ahead.
[00:39:42.039 --> 00:39:43.660]  Yes, it's 6 o'clock yesterday.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.942]  I got an email back from Betsy Fisher.
[00:39:47.062 --> 00:40:01.313]  She's apparently the executive producer at NBC, and she wrote me in response to my calling out Tim Russert to have Ron Paul on Meet the Press, and she said that he would be on Meet the Press this coming Sunday.
[00:40:02.654 --> 00:40:07.377]  Yeah, that's what this money bomb is going to do, is it's going to force a whole new wave.
[00:40:07.678 --> 00:40:21.728]  See, the reason they're trying to water things down, we're not seeing as big a media response as we did at the last money bomb, even though this dwarfs it, is because they know his poll numbers doubled last time when they actually let him be in a poll.
[00:40:22.528 --> 00:40:23.409]  That's the big issue here.
[00:40:23.429 --> 00:40:24.850]  They're not including him in most of these polls.
[00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.271]  So that's a fraud.
[00:40:27.231 --> 00:40:36.457]  And they know that if he gets on Jay Leno and CNN and everywhere else again, that his numbers will double again going into the primary.
[00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:38.538]  Absolutely.
[00:40:40.379 --> 00:40:41.140]  Anything else, Eric?
[00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:43.021]  Just a couple of things.
[00:40:43.722 --> 00:40:51.667]  This is a serious fight and people that listen to your show need to take precautionary steps.
[00:40:51.847 --> 00:40:55.309]  I'm personally having a UPS delivery from eFoods.
[00:40:56.258 --> 00:40:58.019]  Um, a sizable delivery today.
[00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:58.799]  It's actually coming.
[00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:05.422]  And, uh, people also need to get involved with VoteRescue.org and do some exit polling on the primaries.
[00:41:06.442 --> 00:41:12.805]  And, uh, you know, they're really, they're really getting, the establishment is getting freaked out if you go to WeAreChanged.
[00:41:13.365 --> 00:41:18.187]  There was a guy that confronted Bill Clinton and then he got a visit from Secret Service.
[00:41:18.954 --> 00:41:22.955]  Asking him if he would use violence to defend the Constitution?
[00:41:23.095 --> 00:41:23.955]  Is this brand new?
[00:41:24.015 --> 00:41:24.655]  Hey, Aaron!
[00:41:24.916 --> 00:41:25.096]  Yes?
[00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:27.356]  I'm calling Aaron in.
[00:41:27.656 --> 00:41:28.857]  Which WeAreChange is this?
[00:41:28.897 --> 00:41:29.977]  Which WeAreChange chapter?
[00:41:31.037 --> 00:41:34.398]  I think it was Philly, but it's one of the top stories on WeAreChange.
[00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:35.638]  Yeah, I mean, here's the problem.
[00:41:35.958 --> 00:41:37.499]  There's just no way for me to keep track of everything.
[00:41:37.779 --> 00:41:41.960]  Hey Aaron, one of the WeAreChange people, he believes it's Philly, but it's on WeAreChange.org.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.521]  Oh, he's already set.
[00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:45.462]  Was it Simon Moore this happened to?
[00:41:45.482 --> 00:41:46.823]  Oh no, that's We Are Change UK, right?
[00:42:04.497 --> 00:42:06.158]  Yeah, no, we are changed, Philly.
[00:42:06.698 --> 00:42:08.359]  The listener's telling us, Trey.
[00:42:08.739 --> 00:42:12.441]  I got a Secret Service visit, presumably, asking Bill Clinton questions.
[00:42:13.721 --> 00:42:15.582]  Yeah, but it'll be on .org, okay?
[00:42:15.862 --> 00:42:16.543]  Move, let's go.
[00:42:16.623 --> 00:42:17.303]  Good, good job.
[00:42:17.683 --> 00:42:18.144]  All right.
[00:42:18.664 --> 00:42:20.585]  I get real excited, folks.
[00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:21.605]  It's all wild in here.
[00:42:21.845 --> 00:42:22.386]  Thank you, guys.
[00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:22.946]  Good job, Aaron.
[00:42:22.966 --> 00:42:23.586]  Good job, Trey.
[00:42:26.928 --> 00:42:27.948]  Okay, sir, thank you for the call.
[00:42:27.968 --> 00:42:28.689]  I appreciate that.
[00:42:28.729 --> 00:42:29.909]  See, that's why the caller's calling.
[00:42:29.929 --> 00:42:31.430]  We just can't keep track of all the tyranny here.
[00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:32.790]  Kyle in Florida.
[00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:33.311]  You're on the air.
[00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:33.711]  Go ahead.
[00:42:34.335 --> 00:42:35.235]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:42:36.295 --> 00:42:44.277]  I'm on InfoWars right now, and I'm reading the story about Bilderberg leaders considering assassinating Ron Paul.
[00:42:45.558 --> 00:42:49.359]  I just want to say that if this happens, my wife and I are prepared to leave the country.
[00:42:49.679 --> 00:42:54.440]  And the question I have for you is, have you found any place through your worldly travels that is
[00:42:56.044 --> 00:42:58.925]  Trying to fight the New World Order more than any other place in the world.
[00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:01.446]  Switzerland was free, completely armed.
[00:43:01.466 --> 00:43:02.906]  They've now been absorbed by the New World Order.
[00:43:02.926 --> 00:43:04.427]  They're even passing gun laws there.
[00:43:05.527 --> 00:43:06.988]  Costa Rica was free.
[00:43:07.048 --> 00:43:08.108]  It's now been taken over.
[00:43:08.648 --> 00:43:10.209]  There is nowhere to go.
[00:43:11.129 --> 00:43:11.509]  Nowhere.
[00:43:11.529 --> 00:43:13.750]  So we're best off fighting it from right here.
[00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:19.432]  And even the third world countries that the globalists are trying to take over, most of them are run by dirtbag dictators.
[00:43:19.452 --> 00:43:21.353]  It's just they're not run by the New World Order.
[00:43:22.327 --> 00:43:28.597]  Oh, my other question for you is, have you seen this, all the buzz about the Morgan Spurlock documentary about where in the world is Osama Bin Laden?
[00:43:29.099 --> 00:43:41.267]  Yes, and we need to do a report on that as well because the Weinsteins have bought that film and reportedly they got video or an interview with Bin Laden.
[00:43:41.647 --> 00:43:43.269]  Sounds like a giant psy-op to me.
[00:43:43.329 --> 00:43:44.249]  Who knows what's going on?
[00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:47.792]  All our intel is is he died shortly after 9-11 of kidney failure.
[00:43:48.652 --> 00:43:51.274]  But yes, he's the guy that of course made Super Size Me.
[00:43:51.294 --> 00:43:51.914]  Thanks for the call.
[00:43:52.395 --> 00:43:53.475]  Carlos in New York.
[00:43:53.515 --> 00:43:54.116]  You're on the air.
[00:43:54.136 --> 00:43:56.637]  Go ahead, Carlos.
[00:43:57.878 --> 00:43:58.018]  Hello?
[00:43:58.399 --> 00:43:58.719]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:59.383 --> 00:43:59.903]  Yes, Alex.
[00:44:00.443 --> 00:44:00.724]  Yes.
[00:44:01.164 --> 00:44:01.844]  How are you, sir?
[00:44:02.104 --> 00:44:02.384]  Good.
[00:44:03.305 --> 00:44:04.125]  I'm good myself.
[00:44:04.685 --> 00:44:12.228]  Basically, what I'd like to say is basically, you know, I've seen how the media has basically ignored Ron Paul.
[00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:16.350]  And it's very ridiculous, especially here in New York City.
[00:44:18.111 --> 00:44:24.853]  Basically, you know, I'd like to say that everybody should contribute to the Ron Paul revolution.
[00:44:25.894 --> 00:44:28.535]  And myself, a father of six children,
[00:44:29.181 --> 00:44:32.684]  You know, here in New York, taxes are high, rents are high, things like that.
[00:44:33.345 --> 00:44:35.226]  Basically, I've done my part.
[00:44:35.466 --> 00:44:40.010]  I'm going to contribute as much as I can to Ron Paul, which is $60.
[00:44:40.631 --> 00:44:44.034]  I have purchased a thousand bumper stickers.
[00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:48.958]  I was about to say, even if you don't have money, and a lot of people don't, you can tell people about Ron Paul.
[00:44:49.718 --> 00:44:52.160]  Yes, that's what I'm doing with the bumper stickers as well.
[00:44:52.841 --> 00:44:56.384]  I've been listening to you for about eight years.
[00:44:57.388 --> 00:45:04.010]  And what I've done basically is I had 32 blank CDs for you.
[00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:11.292]  Basically what I did was I downloaded your end game and I distributed those.
[00:45:12.052 --> 00:45:18.674]  And I recently purchased 100 copies, you know, blank CDs and I distributed those as well.
[00:45:20.538 --> 00:45:21.899]  I'm getting a banner done.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:36.232]  If every listener we've got just would get in game and make copies of it or download it from PrisonPlanet.tv so it's higher quality and put it on disk and gave a hundred copies it would send seismic shockwaves through the system.
[00:45:37.773 --> 00:45:42.177]  I mean that's what we have to do because we have to spread the message.
[00:45:42.937 --> 00:45:44.018]  You know it's very urgent.
[00:45:44.439 --> 00:45:48.082]  Most people don't know about what's going on you know with SPP.
[00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:49.610]  And all these things.
[00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.992]  I mean, people are just sleeping out here.
[00:45:52.152 --> 00:45:55.815]  And it's your job to wake them up, and God bless you and your children, Carlos.
[00:45:55.855 --> 00:45:56.616]  Thank you for the call.
[00:45:57.416 --> 00:45:58.537]  Zolt in Florida.
[00:45:58.597 --> 00:45:59.498]  Zolt, you're on the air.
[00:46:00.219 --> 00:46:01.020]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.301]  Love all that you do.
[00:46:02.361 --> 00:46:02.801]  Thank you.
[00:46:03.081 --> 00:46:09.467]  The action I've been taking is I'm changing my affiliation to Republican so I can vote for him in a closed primary here.
[00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:12.409]  I sent the money bomb in, $100 the first one.
[00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:13.931]  Yesterday, I couldn't get in.
[00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:14.551]  I pledged $100.
[00:46:15.956 --> 00:46:21.180]  The screen just wouldn't accept my information, which I triple-checked my information.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.481]  Yeah, we did get reports of some server overload, yeah.
[00:46:23.982 --> 00:46:27.124]  Okay, that's what it was, so I'm going to be doing that.
[00:46:28.064 --> 00:46:36.210]  I was out late, it was dark, and there was Ron Paul supporters on a street corner, I would say about 30.
[00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:43.455]  They had to have been all young people in their 20s or something, and they even had a Ron Paul sign lit up.
[00:46:44.269 --> 00:46:50.735]  Yeah, I got reports from Chicago of Ron Paul supporters being told they couldn't stand on street corners with signs.
[00:46:50.795 --> 00:46:51.996]  I mean, I thought this was America.
[00:46:52.236 --> 00:46:53.818]  We're becoming the Soviet Union.
[00:46:53.878 --> 00:46:54.338]  Anything else?
[00:46:55.039 --> 00:47:02.545]  Well, we're doing it down here, and I got signs on all the street corners around my house here in St.
[00:47:02.585 --> 00:47:03.486]  Petersburg, Florida.
[00:47:03.867 --> 00:47:06.889]  I was at the CNN YouTube debate.
[00:47:06.929 --> 00:47:08.150]  I wasn't in the main venue.
[00:47:08.251 --> 00:47:09.632]  I was in the overflow venue.
[00:47:10.689 --> 00:47:13.250]  And I wanted to get in earlier and tell you about that.
[00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:20.051]  There was over 500 total Ron Paul supporters at that YouTube debate down here.
[00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:22.671]  And it was just fabulous.
[00:47:22.752 --> 00:47:26.552]  And there was about 100 in the main venue and 400 in the overflow venue.
[00:47:26.592 --> 00:47:27.572]  I was in the overflow.
[00:47:27.592 --> 00:47:31.113]  And I would say, Alex, 60% of the people there were under 40.
[00:47:35.882 --> 00:47:36.882]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:47:36.902 --> 00:47:43.184]  And revolutions are generally driven by the young people and folks that are below 40.
[00:47:44.164 --> 00:47:50.105]  And we're seeing that happen here, and that's why the establishment has analyzed the trend and is very upset and very concerned.
[00:47:50.646 --> 00:47:56.427]  Speaking of how they're spinning Ron Paul, one of many different tactics they're using
[00:47:58.096 --> 00:48:02.638]  Is, they'll literally have news reports going, John McCain burped this morning.
[00:48:02.698 --> 00:48:04.639]  You know, John McCain wiped his nose.
[00:48:05.399 --> 00:48:08.741]  I mean, to be serious, it'll be, John McCain, what's he gonna say?
[00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:14.383]  I mean, the guy's polling lower than Ron Paul and can't even raise a tenth of the money.
[00:48:15.003 --> 00:48:16.344]  But we gotta talk about him all day.
[00:48:18.005 --> 00:48:23.207]  Or they'll say, John McCain picked up key endorsements by the Boston Globe and the Seattle
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.081]  Post-Intelligence-er!
[00:48:25.201 --> 00:48:26.001]  Whoop-dee-doo!
[00:48:26.342 --> 00:48:27.823]  The system's endorsing!
[00:48:28.103 --> 00:48:28.803]  Who cares-er?
[00:48:29.044 --> 00:48:31.125]  Fred Thompson picked up key endorsements!
[00:48:31.145 --> 00:48:33.486]  See, it's all about the system endorsing people.
[00:48:34.047 --> 00:48:42.893]  The public, the internet, the meet-up groups, the rallies, the money proves the people have chosen Ron Paul.
[00:48:43.893 --> 00:48:45.995]  So, that's another thing they're doing.
[00:48:46.355 --> 00:48:48.416]  Let's talk to Tony in Texas.
[00:48:48.437 --> 00:48:49.577]  Tony, you're on the air.
[00:48:50.518 --> 00:48:51.479]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:51.999 --> 00:48:53.340]  I just feel sick today.
[00:48:54.501 --> 00:49:12.981]  I went to the Ron Paul rally yesterday, my voice is gone from screaming Go Ron Paul, so please excuse me, but I saw a report today on Headline News that said this gentleman, Larry Bourbonnaise is his name, he was the guy, the hero, Vietnam veteran in that church shooting Larry Pratt and you were talking about last week.
[00:49:13.001 --> 00:49:13.782]  Yeah, what's his name again?
[00:49:14.435 --> 00:49:21.680]  Larry Bourbonnais, Bourbon with an N-A-I-S on the end of it, was kicked out of his church yesterday.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.541]  Was booted from his church.
[00:49:25.522 --> 00:49:34.087]  The officials told him, it was on Headline News this morning, they told him he was being kicked out for disparaging security.
[00:49:34.928 --> 00:49:36.689]  When church officials were asked,
[00:49:37.219 --> 00:49:43.164]  They said, oh, well, he was becoming volatile and we didn't want him to disrupt the service.
[00:49:43.404 --> 00:49:45.286]  They showed him leaving the church with his wife.
[00:49:45.326 --> 00:49:51.591]  He's in this nice gray suit with a red tie, his wife there in a nice red dress.
[00:49:52.271 --> 00:49:53.813]  You know this man cried.
[00:49:53.853 --> 00:49:55.114]  You know he shed tears.
[00:49:55.154 --> 00:49:56.635]  He was saying, I took a bullet.
[00:49:57.233 --> 00:50:08.496]  Well, they're mad because he was trying to rally the other armed volunteer security guards before the heroin got there and took them out.
[00:50:09.317 --> 00:50:13.638]  And this has all been reported on, and Larry Pratt covered it here last week on GunOwners.org.
[00:50:14.916 --> 00:50:18.557]  And so he tried to shove them to the front and demanded they fight.
[00:50:18.617 --> 00:50:19.157]  They wouldn't.
[00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:21.377]  So he ran up and yelled at the guy.
[00:50:21.477 --> 00:50:22.838]  And yeah, I got shot in the arm.
[00:50:23.278 --> 00:50:29.719]  And so they're mad at him for being angry at the other cowardly guard.
[00:50:29.739 --> 00:50:31.379]  I mean, that's what you're supposed to do.
[00:50:31.439 --> 00:50:38.241]  He tried to make the guard give him his gun because the guard didn't do the right thing like the woman did.
[00:50:38.261 --> 00:50:40.501]  And you're telling me that he was kicked out of the church.
[00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:42.422]  That is outrageous.
[00:50:42.942 --> 00:50:43.682]  Thank you for the call.
[00:50:44.557 --> 00:50:51.583]  More calls at 1-800-259-9231 on the Ron Paul Money Bomb Revolution.
[00:50:51.903 --> 00:50:53.565]  Where do you think this is going in the future?
[00:50:53.845 --> 00:50:55.666]  What attack pieces do you think they're going to launch?
[00:50:55.947 --> 00:50:57.007]  How we should counter it?
[00:50:57.388 --> 00:50:59.990]  And then I'm going to get into a whole other section of key news.
[00:51:02.232 --> 00:51:03.633]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.653 --> 00:51:05.755]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.475 --> 00:51:10.759]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power called God.
[00:51:11.974 --> 00:51:19.398]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:20.138 --> 00:51:27.481]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.493 --> 00:51:35.476]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.937 --> 00:51:39.399]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.799 --> 00:51:42.301]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.361 --> 00:51:43.361]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.381 --> 00:51:44.262]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.282 --> 00:51:45.382]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.583 --> 00:51:46.343]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:47.604]  That's what they're after.

[00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.791]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:00.452]  You have been warned.
[00:52:01.574 --> 00:52:05.137]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.177 --> 00:52:05.698]  are located?
[00:52:05.898 --> 00:52:09.281]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:09.521 --> 00:52:14.226]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:52:14.506 --> 00:52:21.453]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes,
[00:52:21.573 --> 00:52:21.954]  I think so.
[00:52:39.056 --> 00:52:39.336]  I think so.
[00:53:00.891 --> 00:53:05.837]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:53:06.157 --> 00:53:08.039]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:53:08.239 --> 00:53:11.283]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:53:11.463 --> 00:53:14.606]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:53:14.907 --> 00:53:16.769]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:53:17.029 --> 00:53:20.733]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:53:21.014 --> 00:53:23.677]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:53:24.298 --> 00:53:28.583]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:53:28.803 --> 00:53:33.048]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:53:33.468 --> 00:53:37.812]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:53:38.112 --> 00:53:42.375]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[00:53:42.715 --> 00:53:48.580]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.322]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[00:53:51.522 --> 00:53:52.023]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:53:52.043 --> 00:53:53.144]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[00:54:09.597 --> 00:54:11.018]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:54:11.098 --> 00:54:12.179]  until 2 p.m.
[00:54:12.639 --> 00:54:13.380]  Central Time.
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.360]  We're here live.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:20.444]  We restream the show out the 21 hours of the next live transmission at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:20.484 --> 00:54:26.529]  You can also subscribe to the free podcast at InfoWars.com, your MP3, iPod, computer.
[00:54:27.129 --> 00:54:30.351]  By the way, if you want this message to grow, we are the tip of the spear.
[00:54:30.891 --> 00:54:31.472]  It's up to you.
[00:54:32.342 --> 00:54:45.252]  And the balls in your court to tell your friends, your neighbors, your family, your email list, your MySpace account, your meetup groups about PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and our newest site, PrisonNews.us.
[00:54:45.313 --> 00:54:52.178]  And, you know, I'm asking you listeners to help me get this message out because there's very few people talking about race-specific bioweapons.
[00:54:52.198 --> 00:54:53.899]  There's very few people talking about eugenics.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:57.022]  There's very few people talking about the full scope of the New World Order.
[00:54:57.935 --> 00:55:11.406]  There's a lot of watered-down versions of it, and I try to get other people to cover it, and try to get other people to get into these issues, and we have everybody on who is discussing it, but this key info needs to go viral, and that is up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:12.587 --> 00:55:22.114]  All right, I'm going to just blast through your calls now, because we're going to get We Are Change Philly on, who did get a visit from the Secret Service for asking Bill Clinton questions, all about intimidation, secret police.
[00:55:23.555 --> 00:55:27.058]  That's coming up in about 45 minutes, a lot more.
[00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:33.148]  So, we're going to be discussing all of that coming up in the next hour.
[00:55:33.629 --> 00:55:36.111]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Zach in Canada.
[00:55:36.131 --> 00:55:36.971]  Zach, you're on the air.
[00:55:36.991 --> 00:55:38.833]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[00:55:39.373 --> 00:55:44.277]  Yeah, that Ron Paul with the media, it's pretty pathetic how they're avoiding him, it seems.
[00:55:45.959 --> 00:55:50.663]  Well, I mean, this money bomb isn't getting as much attention as the last one, and it's much bigger.
[00:55:51.523 --> 00:55:53.745]  And can we support him?
[00:55:53.825 --> 00:55:54.726]  I'm up in Canada here.
[00:55:55.498 --> 00:55:57.799]  Is it, like, can we, like, buy t-shirts and that?
[00:55:57.839 --> 00:55:58.579]  Is that just as good?
[00:55:58.599 --> 00:56:12.682]  Because I know we can't give, you know, donations and stuff, but is that... No, I don't believe the campaign will sell you t-shirts because that's considered a campaign purchase, a campaign contribution, but you can find other people.
[00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:17.643]  There's a bunch of folks on the bandwagon selling t-shirts and everything else out there on the web.
[00:56:17.683 --> 00:56:19.004]  We've chosen not to do it here, but
[00:56:22.106 --> 00:56:29.630]  I mean, you can get on email lists, you can go on message boards, you can spread the word, but I wouldn't even go to the Ron Paul boards, the Ron Paul sites.
[00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:30.811]  That's the choir.
[00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:33.372]  I'd go on the ABC and CNN message boards.
[00:56:33.432 --> 00:56:35.953]  I'd go on the MSNBC message boards.
[00:56:35.993 --> 00:56:39.395]  I'd go on the Sean Hannity message boards.
[00:56:39.895 --> 00:56:43.177]  I would just go, I would go on the Dig stories just randomly.
[00:56:43.897 --> 00:56:48.039]  And just, I mean, they're a bunch of censors anyway, so just, so just mop the floor with them.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.781]  And with the media up here, you've heard it at CBC, eh?
[00:56:51.425 --> 00:56:53.167]  At Canada National Station?
[00:56:53.307 --> 00:56:54.728]  Yeah.
[00:56:54.748 --> 00:57:00.332]  Last Wednesday, they were doing a story out on the street, and then some police action broke out across the street.
[00:57:00.773 --> 00:57:04.436]  They had to go pick up some three suspects for theft or something.
[00:57:04.916 --> 00:57:08.819]  And so the guy thought, oh, here's some breaking news, so the CBC cameramen started filming it.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:12.943]  And next thing you know, he's getting arrested by the police for obstruction of justice.
[00:57:13.123 --> 00:57:14.684]  Yeah, I saw that in the report.
[00:57:14.944 --> 00:57:20.309]  And I saw that report in Mainline, AP reporters, national video people.
[00:57:21.147 --> 00:57:23.688]  Now the cops will even beat you up if you have a big camera.
[00:57:23.708 --> 00:57:24.788]  They've gone crazy.
[00:57:25.628 --> 00:57:35.010]  And they just think it's their right to do it because the system and the higher-ups are telling them to do it because they want to send a message that we're in a police state.
[00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:36.011]  Thanks for the call, Zach.
[00:57:36.391 --> 00:57:37.851]  I did see that report out of Canada.
[00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:39.532]  You know, the reporter's polite.
[00:57:39.572 --> 00:57:40.472]  He's videotaping it.
[00:57:40.492 --> 00:57:41.532]  They're out there doing a report.
[00:57:43.112 --> 00:57:47.774]  And then stuff breaks out, and so they beat the daylights out of them and arrest them.
[00:57:48.134 --> 00:57:49.234]  I mean, that's crazy.
[00:57:50.217 --> 00:57:52.498]  I've been here in Austin and been videotaping checkpoints.
[00:57:52.558 --> 00:57:57.439]  I'll be, you know, 150 yards away up on a highway, you know, at a parking lot.
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:00.761]  I know not to get involved in police actions or police activity.
[00:58:01.081 --> 00:58:02.161]  I'm not going to get in the middle of it.
[00:58:02.181 --> 00:58:03.642]  I'm not going to walk up to the cops.
[00:58:03.942 --> 00:58:06.543]  And the cops will walk over, drive over, say, turn your camera off.
[00:58:07.003 --> 00:58:08.783]  And I'll say, no, officer, it's First Amendment.
[00:58:08.803 --> 00:58:11.484]  And they'll say, okay, give me your license.
[00:58:11.504 --> 00:58:12.385]  You're about to get arrested.
[00:58:12.465 --> 00:58:13.585]  And I'll just say, please.
[00:58:14.813 --> 00:58:15.233]  Please.
[00:58:15.554 --> 00:58:18.156]  You've seen this on video many times on the web.
[00:58:18.556 --> 00:58:19.036]  Please.
[00:58:19.817 --> 00:58:20.878]  Don't make me sue you.
[00:58:21.058 --> 00:58:21.498]  Please.
[00:58:21.978 --> 00:58:24.140]  You can beat the Rep, but you're not going to beat the right.
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:26.162]  Don't violate my First Amendment, officer.
[00:58:26.222 --> 00:58:27.443]  I just want to videotape this.
[00:58:27.723 --> 00:58:28.343]  It's my right.
[00:58:28.723 --> 00:58:30.425]  Don't break the law.
[00:58:31.045 --> 00:58:33.407]  Don't make me hurt you financially.
[00:58:33.447 --> 00:58:34.107]  And they back off.
[00:58:34.808 --> 00:58:36.409]  But they're getting to the point where they may not.
[00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:38.651]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:43.834 --> 00:58:45.455]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.798]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.145 --> 00:58:58.826]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.446 --> 00:59:00.567]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.208 --> 00:59:02.329]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.969 --> 00:59:03.770]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.537 --> 00:59:05.397]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.417 --> 00:59:09.699]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.279 --> 00:59:14.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:22.503]  Alright, I'm going to take three or four more calls in this short segment.
[00:59:23.263 --> 00:59:29.525]  Then I'm going to analyze kind of a wider field of what we face as a society and what we face individually.
[00:59:30.565 --> 00:59:32.086]  Comments on the Ron Paul revolution,
[00:59:33.783 --> 00:59:42.387]  Just a whole spectrum of thoughts and ideas and things I've already discussed before but in even greater clarity.
[00:59:43.567 --> 00:59:48.870]  As well as how I'm being threatened and my arrest is being called for on national radio on almost a daily basis now.
[00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:51.471]  I do need your prayers.
[00:59:51.511 --> 00:59:52.371]  I need your support.
[00:59:53.372 --> 00:59:54.472]  Sometimes it's trying.
[00:59:55.773 --> 01:00:00.355]  And it's always in the middle of the night when I really get reflective and kind of slow down for the day.
[01:00:00.735 --> 01:00:02.476]  And I kind of get off of just being like a
[01:00:03.778 --> 01:00:04.058]  Yes, I do.
[01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:04.318]  I do.
[01:00:30.792 --> 01:00:35.415]  Uh, get, uh, just to see immoral things happening all around me.
[01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:38.877]  Uh, just see... It's just depressing.
[01:00:38.897 --> 01:00:42.159]  The whole state of society and everything that's happening.
[01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:45.541]  So I've just got a lot of, you know, reflective, important points I'm going to be making.
[01:00:46.402 --> 01:00:50.244]  Uh, let's go to, uh... Who's up next here?
[01:00:51.685 --> 01:00:52.705]  Howard in Ohio.
[01:00:52.745 --> 01:00:53.346]  You're on the air.
[01:00:53.406 --> 01:00:53.826]  Go ahead.
[01:00:56.988 --> 01:00:58.049]  Yeah, Howard, you're on air.
[01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.509]  Mm-hmm.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:00.600]  Let him go.
[01:01:01.321 --> 01:01:02.201]  Leo and Matt.
[01:01:02.301 --> 01:01:03.282]  Leo, you're on the air.
[01:01:03.302 --> 01:01:03.702]  Go ahead.
[01:01:04.102 --> 01:01:04.563]  Yeah, hi.
[01:01:05.323 --> 01:01:23.214]  I was at the Faneuil Hall 9-11 in Boston on Saturday, and I happened to corner Ray McGovern in the men's room and asked him, since Amy Goodman and Noam Chomsky are considered gatekeepers of the left, what's your opinion on this?
[01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:25.295]  And Ray was most non-committal.
[01:01:25.931 --> 01:01:30.073]  non-committal about these serious allegations, basically refusing to take on the issue.
[01:01:30.513 --> 01:01:32.193]  So what conclusion should I draw from this?
[01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:40.817]  One, he's a typical wishy-washy politician evading questions, or two, he's an actual operative of the system pretending to speak the truth to power.
[01:01:41.817 --> 01:01:47.999]  So you're saying Ray McGovern, the former CIA briefer for Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr., was at the Ron Paul event?
[01:01:48.019 --> 01:01:48.940]  Yeah.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.781]  And it was a non-committal?
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.081]  Well, that's what he said in the bathroom.
[01:01:55.101 --> 01:01:56.181]  I didn't ask him in public.
[01:01:56.221 --> 01:01:57.742]  I figured he'd be more candid there.
[01:01:58.082 --> 01:02:04.164]  Well, look, it's real simple, and I'm the same way, and I'm not defending saying Ray McGovern's a period of driven stub, but he seems pretty good to me.
[01:02:05.564 --> 01:02:11.667]  A lot of times you get in a crowd, you've already talked to a hundred people, it's not that you don't like the people individually, you're kind of burnt out.
[01:02:12.147 --> 01:02:15.468]  I have people question me in the bathroom every time I'm at events, it's very irritating.
[01:02:15.868 --> 01:02:20.110]  I mean, every event I'm at, I will be at the urinal and someone walks over and starts talking to me.
[01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:21.590]  Well, we were washing your hands.
[01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:23.031]  No, no, I'm not saying you did that.
[01:02:23.411 --> 01:02:26.572]  But my point is, is that I don't like being talked to in the bathroom.
[01:02:26.972 --> 01:02:28.193]  And I'm not saying you're bad.
[01:02:28.733 --> 01:02:32.654]  It's just that a lot of times I'll be non-committal to somebody because I don't want to start a conversation up.
[01:02:32.995 --> 01:02:34.575]  Let's say I want to get back to where I met her.
[01:02:34.595 --> 01:02:36.276]  I got to go call my wife on my phone.
[01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:42.638]  Or, you know, I got 20 things on my mind and I'll tell somebody, you know, they'll walk up to me and say,
[01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:43.750]  No, no, no.
[01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:44.130]  I understand.
[01:03:04.955 --> 01:03:06.336]  I was trying to get your assessment of it.
[01:03:06.676 --> 01:03:08.858]  Also, another little piece of tit-bit information.
[01:03:09.258 --> 01:03:13.341]  You know the guy, Horan, who's the air traffic controller guy who's with the 9-11 people?
[01:03:14.381 --> 01:03:14.641]  Yes.
[01:03:15.322 --> 01:03:16.303]  Okay.
[01:03:17.423 --> 01:03:21.866]  I spoke to him outside the hall, and he was saying, oh, Ron Paul's a one-trick pony.
[01:03:22.587 --> 01:03:22.927]  Quote.
[01:03:23.627 --> 01:03:23.888]  Quote.
[01:03:24.948 --> 01:03:25.229]  Okay?
[01:03:25.749 --> 01:03:28.471]  And also, he's pushing PDA.
[01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:31.988]  And that's his, that's his big, his big stand.
[01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:37.491]  And he's more for the quiet type of dissemination of information.
[01:03:37.531 --> 01:03:43.475]  Because you gotta realize, as much as we love your, your, your emphatic style... Listen, I gotta go, bro.
[01:03:43.655 --> 01:03:45.176]  Gotta go, okay?
[01:03:45.216 --> 01:03:48.018]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:48.518]  Stay with me.
[01:03:49.919 --> 01:03:51.500]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.521]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:03.555]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:03.596 --> 01:04:05.177]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:04:06.238 --> 01:04:08.481]  So, their objective being world domination?
[01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:11.484]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:19.572]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.569 --> 01:04:27.552]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:28.013 --> 01:04:31.475]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:34.377]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world government.
[01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.598]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.618 --> 01:04:36.358]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.378 --> 01:04:37.439]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.679 --> 01:04:38.440]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.781]  That's what they're after.
[01:04:39.801 --> 01:04:48.006]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:05:53.341 --> 01:05:55.182]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:05:55.342 --> 01:06:00.503]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:02.024]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:06:02.284 --> 01:06:10.466]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:06:10.686 --> 01:06:16.468]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:06:16.588 --> 01:06:18.328]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:06:18.428 --> 01:06:20.529]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:06:20.729 --> 01:06:24.974]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:06:25.134 --> 01:06:27.297]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:06:27.377 --> 01:06:35.125]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:06:35.606 --> 01:06:35.946]  We're good.
[01:06:55.075 --> 01:07:01.097]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:04.758]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.779 --> 01:07:08.220]  Alright, more on the Ron Paul revolution.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.361]  Coming up, more on the economy.
[01:07:12.081 --> 01:07:13.802]  Alan Greenspan, former Fed Chief.
[01:07:15.223 --> 01:07:17.363]  When he speaks, the central bankers are talking.
[01:07:17.383 --> 01:07:19.444]  That's what the establishment's saying.
[01:07:19.484 --> 01:07:20.205]  He's a mouthpiece.
[01:07:20.725 --> 01:07:21.205]  Figurehead.
[01:07:23.357 --> 01:07:28.902]  He's saying we're clearly going into stagflation, so really serious news on that, and I will cover it all today.
[01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:30.603]  And more of your phone calls.
[01:07:30.783 --> 01:07:42.633]  We've also got We Are Change UK coming on at the same time as We Are Change Philly to give you a quick 15-minute report with both sides concerning the Secret Service visiting We Are Change Philly as a chilling effect.
[01:07:42.673 --> 01:07:43.994]  How dare you ask Bill Clinton questions?
[01:07:44.014 --> 01:07:45.015]  You're not a threat, are you?
[01:07:45.476 --> 01:07:46.657]  All part of the intimidation.
[01:07:47.557 --> 01:07:48.638]  And We Are Change Philly can
[01:07:50.393 --> 01:07:52.935]  You know, taking action, basically just being demonized for it.
[01:07:52.955 --> 01:08:05.203]  And we've got We Are Change UK coming on about how they confronted the head of visor consultancy, the former head of Scotland Yard Anti-Terror, who was running exact drills at the exact same trains, being attacked at the exact same time, exact same place.
[01:08:05.243 --> 01:08:05.964]  That's impossible.
[01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:09.647]  So, and he had mentioned his own words, they did that.
[01:08:09.667 --> 01:08:18.253]  So we're going to have a discussion about 9-11 coming up, a government-sponsored terror, period, at the bottom of the hour for just about 10-15 minutes.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:24.421]  We need to get reflective from time to time.
[01:08:24.621 --> 01:08:36.246]  All of us tend to get caught in the rat race and running around the treadmill, busy working, paying bills, doing laundry, cooking dinner, working, trying to squeeze in some leisure time.
[01:08:36.266 --> 01:08:42.288]  I took my children for like an hour and a half to the park and we rode the Zilker Park train around.
[01:08:42.308 --> 01:08:45.410]  That was great, but that's about the time I got off yesterday.
[01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:47.951]  I got about two hours off for the weekend.
[01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:48.731]  That was my time.
[01:08:50.655 --> 01:08:57.461]  And then sometimes I say, man, I just can't work this hard, but then I realize what the stakes are, and that I've got to do it.
[01:08:58.382 --> 01:09:09.751]  And sometimes I get tired, I get exhausted, but then I realize just how serious things are, or I hear Michael Medwood call for my arrest, or I hear Neil Bortz say I'm Timothy McVeigh, and I realize, you know what, buddy?
[01:09:10.152 --> 01:09:14.495]  You're in this really deep now, and your instincts to literally work 18-20 hours a day are healthy.
[01:09:20.794 --> 01:09:30.899]  And I'm not whining here, this is a great weight on me, and I'm just going to talk about this first briefly, and then I'm going to get into all the other big issues that this dovetails into.
[01:09:34.781 --> 01:09:43.705]  Laying there in bed for two hours last night, though my body was exhausted I couldn't go to sleep, I thought about literally thousands of issues.
[01:09:45.928 --> 01:09:57.633]  I don't know why, late at night, after a long day of work, that laying there in the cool darkness, with the moonlight shining through the window, that my brain works so much better in that quiet place.
[01:09:58.793 --> 01:10:01.214]  And then I try to come here and articulate it to you.
[01:10:01.754 --> 01:10:08.957]  It's hard to do, you know, to articulate the mind's eye and just thousands of thoughts at once.
[01:10:10.038 --> 01:10:15.420]  But, you know, I reflect on who I am.
[01:10:16.377 --> 01:10:31.358]  I'm just somebody from the suburb of Dallas who's a gun-toting, in the past, beer-drinking, arm-wrestling, brawling, tobacco-chewing Texan.
[01:10:36.551 --> 01:10:39.234]  And all, but at the same time I read a lot of history books.
[01:10:39.294 --> 01:10:40.575]  I discovered how the world worked.
[01:10:41.095 --> 01:10:42.637]  I read the Globalist on documents.
[01:10:42.757 --> 01:10:44.278]  I decided I didn't like what they were doing.
[01:10:44.839 --> 01:10:48.282]  I didn't know 1-100 when I started out 14 years ago.
[01:10:48.802 --> 01:10:53.807]  I was involved in the community for a few years before I got on air, but I've been on air about 13 years now.
[01:10:56.890 --> 01:11:02.235]  But I knew more then than most people, than most intellectuals today.
[01:11:05.569 --> 01:11:11.154]  And I'd also been schooled in the ways of the world pretty young by, I guess, being at the wrong place at the wrong time.
[01:11:11.174 --> 01:11:13.095]  You could say right place at the right time.
[01:11:13.475 --> 01:11:20.641]  To see a lot of corruption, to see a lot of evil, to be around fast women, fast cars.
[01:11:26.626 --> 01:11:33.051]  And so, I got into this and I really didn't have any idea of what I was getting involved in.
[01:11:34.278 --> 01:11:45.888]  I never had any goal of being a leader of the rebellion against tyranny.
[01:11:48.631 --> 01:11:56.017]  And early on I had more of an ego to drive me and I did enjoy the trappings of prominence.
[01:11:57.879 --> 01:12:01.022]  But I will tell you it is a painful trap as you get deeper into it.
[01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:03.203]  I don't know.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.441]  It's not just about me.
[01:12:22.841 --> 01:12:24.081]  It's about all of us.
[01:12:24.141 --> 01:12:31.945]  I'm just a microcosm or a tiny window into this world and I'm deeper into this than really anybody further along the line than really anybody out there.
[01:12:31.985 --> 01:12:39.469]  I'm more in the spotlight and I'm uncompromising in what I cover and what I discuss.
[01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:45.251]  And I've never compromised what I discuss or what I say.
[01:12:45.271 --> 01:12:45.331]  But
[01:12:52.713 --> 01:13:13.506]  People call in, you hear them all the time, and they say, hey, Neil Bortz attacked you again, Rush Limbaugh attacked you again, Michael Medved attacked you again, Michael Reagan attacked you, Michael Savage attacked you, and they send me audio files and video files, and a lot of times I'll be there in kind of a serious mode, a very focused mode, and I won't watch it.
[01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:20.110]  Other times I'm in a giggly, aggressive, ha-ha-ha mode, and I'll watch it and laugh about it, but I realize it's not a laughing matter.
[01:13:24.182 --> 01:13:26.283]  I watched a video clip that has the audio embedded.
[01:13:29.444 --> 01:13:38.708]  But I mean, I've been listening to this for a year, and I get many more reports of it than I even have time to go check out, and it's the same line.
[01:13:39.508 --> 01:13:42.130]  I'm a Tim McVeigh, and I mean, this is by name.
[01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:47.592]  You notice that, and he said on his show I was dangerous a few weeks ago.
[01:13:49.435 --> 01:13:50.696]  Glenn Beck, by name.
[01:13:51.096 --> 01:13:51.877]  Ron Paul supporter.
[01:13:52.117 --> 01:13:53.398]  People like Alex Jones are dangerous.
[01:13:53.778 --> 01:13:56.120]  Then on the show, he said, these are the McVeigh types.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:57.661]  These are the terrorist types.
[01:13:57.681 --> 01:13:59.302]  We need the Army to do something about them.
[01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:01.564]  Domestically, but he didn't say my name on CNN.
[01:14:02.825 --> 01:14:03.586]  Neil Bortz did.
[01:14:03.926 --> 01:14:05.227]  Again, it's the same talking point.
[01:14:05.267 --> 01:14:06.528]  This is directly from the White House.
[01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:14.313]  Now, can you imagine what it's like knowing that the eye of Sauron is literally looking directly at you?
[01:14:14.353 --> 01:14:15.414]  That'll make you grow up.
[01:14:15.955 --> 01:14:17.676]  That'll make you get your you-know-what together.
[01:14:18.399 --> 01:14:21.040]  That'll burn away any chaff that's left in me.
[01:14:24.101 --> 01:14:27.603]  At least for those brief moments where I'm, you know, at that moment of quickening.
[01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:29.683]  And that much closer to God.
[01:14:30.324 --> 01:14:31.984]  I always fall back into worldliness.
[01:14:33.945 --> 01:14:35.345]  But that'll get your head screwed on.
[01:14:36.206 --> 01:14:36.786]  Real straight.
[01:14:37.226 --> 01:14:42.028]  I mean, I don't take it as fun or enjoyable.
[01:14:42.938 --> 01:14:46.180]  But it's not some bravado, or some daredevil stunt I'm doing.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:52.043]  And I get sick of callers on all the other talk shows I do, the interviews, where, why haven't they killed you yet then?
[01:14:52.103 --> 01:14:53.064]  You're gonna get killed!
[01:14:53.404 --> 01:14:57.126]  Or the discussions all over the web about when I'll get killed, and people making bets about it.
[01:14:57.146 --> 01:15:00.328]  I mean, this is my life we're talking about, and it's not cute, it's not funny.
[01:15:02.349 --> 01:15:05.271]  And I'm willing to die, I'm willing to be killed, but at least don't joke about it.
[01:15:05.511 --> 01:15:07.332]  Have a little bit of respect for it.
[01:15:08.982 --> 01:15:15.706]  And so in my life, I'm going to start demanding respect from people I work with, people I'm around, and people in the media, people everywhere else.
[01:15:16.126 --> 01:15:21.289]  Because, and all of you and the sacrifices you're making out there too, you need to demand respect.
[01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:25.831]  But it's no trifle I'm involved in.
[01:15:25.871 --> 01:15:27.932]  It's not a game, it's not a joke, it's not a drill.
[01:15:29.473 --> 01:15:30.674]  And I have to realize that.
[01:15:31.454 --> 01:15:39.860]  You know, I tend to fall back into the world and fall back into watching movies and, you know, going out with friends and eating enchiladas and joking around and telling jokes.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.343]  And really, things are so serious that that's even starting to burn away.
[01:15:45.204 --> 01:15:48.406]  I'm even starting to lose that, because I'm changing.
[01:15:49.027 --> 01:15:55.892]  Because I realize that, number one, I have a responsibility in the position I'm in, and this mission is so big.
[01:15:57.222 --> 01:16:12.466]  And if I'm going to get killed doing this, which I pray isn't the case, that God will give me more time, or if I'm going to get set up, or imprisoned, or demonized, or whatever dirty tricks they pull out of that black bag, that I want to make what I'm doing now count more than ever.
[01:16:13.146 --> 01:16:14.066]  I want to change.
[01:16:15.006 --> 01:16:16.627]  You know, not do things I've done in the past.
[01:16:17.107 --> 01:16:23.369]  That means if I didn't used to, when I took calls, not move to them quickly or go to them fast, you notice I've been doing that the last few days because I'm changing.
[01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:24.729]  I'm changing a lot of things.
[01:16:27.391 --> 01:16:34.914]  But again, I don't talk a lot about myself here, but we have to, just again as a microcosm of the larger picture.
[01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:51.819]  I mean, driving down the road and hearing Neil Bortz first attack Ron Paul with the standard talking points, and then attack me, and this is the best of they chose, this was all these vignettes.
[01:16:54.065 --> 01:17:02.229]  And then to hear him attack me repeatedly from different clips in his show, Ron Paul repeatedly, and it was the same thing that we hear out of all the other fake neocons.
[01:17:02.269 --> 01:17:07.692]  I mean, now Michael Reagan is saying that Hillary's better than Ron Paul.
[01:17:09.213 --> 01:17:11.234]  And so we're hearing those same talking points.
[01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:16.297]  And we're hearing, I'm McVeigh, I'm Charlie Manson, that's what Bort said.
[01:17:17.278 --> 01:17:23.341]  And then a caller called in and said, I like Alex Jones, and Bort followed another talking point I'm hearing from Michael Medved and others.
[01:17:24.005 --> 01:17:25.866]  I mean, it's chilling.
[01:17:26.346 --> 01:17:28.426]  It's, uh, bracing.
[01:17:28.566 --> 01:17:30.007]  I don't want to say it's scary.
[01:17:30.047 --> 01:17:31.647]  It doesn't scare me, really.
[01:17:32.067 --> 01:17:33.868]  It's bracing, like jumping into cold water.
[01:17:33.888 --> 01:17:38.009]  It wakes me up to know that the White House actually wrote memos about me.
[01:17:38.449 --> 01:17:40.069]  Actually said how to attack me.
[01:17:44.511 --> 01:17:45.691]  And how to attack the public.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.783]  And to tell the caller, you better not talk about how you support Alex Jones.
[01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:51.145]  You better not talk about him.
[01:17:51.165 --> 01:17:52.887]  If I was your boss, I'd fire you.
[01:17:53.067 --> 01:17:57.611]  And any employees out there that have any of these 9-11 truthers or Alex Jones supporters, you need to fire them.
[01:17:57.992 --> 01:17:59.033]  That's what the Soviets did.
[01:17:59.053 --> 01:18:00.214]  That's how the Nazis started.
[01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:03.237]  The first big thing they do is start saying, fire people.
[01:18:03.517 --> 01:18:04.598]  Kick them out of their jobs.
[01:18:04.678 --> 01:18:05.199]  Arrest them.
[01:18:05.519 --> 01:18:06.200]  Question them.
[01:18:08.504 --> 01:18:09.125]  Borch knows.
[01:18:09.165 --> 01:18:09.665]  He's a lawyer.
[01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:10.386]  He's very smart.
[01:18:10.826 --> 01:18:11.727]  I've met him personally.
[01:18:12.047 --> 01:18:12.847]  He's very wicked.
[01:18:12.867 --> 01:18:14.729]  And I don't even hate him anymore.
[01:18:15.009 --> 01:18:17.231]  You know, used to I had the warmness or the hate against these people.
[01:18:17.451 --> 01:18:18.512]  Now I'm sad for them.
[01:18:19.132 --> 01:18:20.693]  I see how they're these wraiths.
[01:18:20.713 --> 01:18:23.235]  These sell-out shells of people.
[01:18:23.596 --> 01:18:25.437]  All they have is their ego and their power trip.
[01:18:26.037 --> 01:18:27.238]  I actually mourn for them.
[01:18:34.224 --> 01:18:34.384]  So...
[01:18:37.483 --> 01:18:40.286]  We need to understand that this is happening.
[01:18:41.688 --> 01:18:43.270]  And I need your prayers.
[01:18:43.931 --> 01:18:45.713]  When we get back, I'm going to get into some other key issues.
[01:18:45.733 --> 01:18:48.776]  I'm going to talk about the Ron Paul campaign very candidly, and a lot more.
[01:18:48.796 --> 01:18:49.157]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.988 --> 01:18:57.889]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:10.374]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:19:10.794 --> 01:19:11.214]  The U.S.
[01:19:11.254 --> 01:19:16.836]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:17.237 --> 01:19:19.437]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:22.359]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:22.399 --> 01:19:25.260]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:31.382]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:19:31.802 --> 01:19:35.163]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:19:35.243 --> 01:19:41.566]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:19:42.146 --> 01:19:46.149]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.

[01:19:46.629 --> 01:19:46.869]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:20:16.118 --> 01:20:16.619]  I think so.

[01:20:53.866 --> 01:20:59.088]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:20:59.248 --> 01:21:07.331]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:21:07.591 --> 01:21:14.633]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:21:14.833 --> 01:21:16.114]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:21:16.174 --> 01:21:22.076]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:21:22.276 --> 01:21:27.378]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:21:27.478 --> 01:21:36.342]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.440]  Don't worry.
[01:22:57.901 --> 01:22:59.422]  This show is documented.
[01:22:59.942 --> 01:23:02.624]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.005]  Yeah, the truth burns.
[01:23:04.105 --> 01:23:05.746]  Alright, let me try to condense this.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:36.226]  The evidence of my information being accurate and effective and timely and well thought out and well balanced is that I am being attacked.
[01:23:37.307 --> 01:23:42.650]  And that what I do is effective and what you do as the listeners of this radio show is effective.
[01:23:44.612 --> 01:23:50.095]  I have to continue to be more prominent, to be more bold, to be more serious, more focused.
[01:23:53.858 --> 01:23:55.599]  Or the statistics show I'm a dead man.
[01:23:56.403 --> 01:23:59.065]  Or a man rotting in a cell.
[01:24:02.248 --> 01:24:03.689]  Sometimes I think death would be better than that.
[01:24:07.252 --> 01:24:10.315]  But I also need to expand on that and say I will never commit suicide.
[01:24:11.456 --> 01:24:12.556]  I don't use drugs.
[01:24:14.558 --> 01:24:19.862]  They'll grab you and stick a heroin needle in your arm, pump you full of pure stuff, and then, you know, oh, Alex died of heroin.
[01:24:19.882 --> 01:24:21.984]  You know, they'll do anything, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:23.786 --> 01:24:25.247]  They think nothing of human life.
[01:24:26.264 --> 01:24:46.290]  And shifting gears out of myself and everybody else, the key to all of this is realizing tens of thousands of declassified admissions of chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals, from the 20s through to today, being sprayed on cities, schools, soldiers, foster children.
[01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:47.810]  I mean murdering them.
[01:24:48.596 --> 01:24:54.640]  Taking children, putting them in a radiation chamber, and putting so much radiation into them, they die on the spot.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:58.322]  Everything from that, to lower doses of radiation to test it.
[01:24:59.222 --> 01:25:05.806]  They think nothing of taking an innocent child who has done nothing to anyone who just wants to play with their toys.
[01:25:05.866 --> 01:25:09.108]  I mean, one and two and three and four year olds by the thousands.
[01:25:09.408 --> 01:25:15.812]  And you know what, neocons and liberals and establishment people, I understand why you go, that guy's a nut, he talks about crazy stuff.
[01:25:16.543 --> 01:25:17.323]  I understand why.
[01:25:17.724 --> 01:25:20.805]  It's scary to admit to yourself that's true.
[01:25:22.145 --> 01:25:24.586]  You've heard about the chemical, biological, radiological testing.
[01:25:24.606 --> 01:25:25.467]  You know that's true.
[01:25:25.507 --> 01:25:26.287]  That's why I mention it.
[01:25:26.607 --> 01:25:27.527]  Everybody's heard about it.
[01:25:27.727 --> 01:25:28.928]  Do you know the full scope?
[01:25:29.008 --> 01:25:29.608]  None of us do.
[01:25:29.828 --> 01:25:33.890]  It's so big, but what is declassified is thousands of times what you even know.
[01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:39.952]  And it takes dark, aggressive, focused force to murder children.
[01:25:42.773 --> 01:25:44.674]  Most humans have an innate, built-in
[01:25:45.533 --> 01:25:46.433]  We're good to go.
[01:26:11.221 --> 01:26:18.209]  It's very upsetting to me that I know they're engaged in all forms of bio-warfare, chemical, radiological, frequency warfare against us.
[01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:23.555]  To know they're hurting us all, to know they're hurting innocents across the world.
[01:26:25.016 --> 01:26:30.102]  To know they have swallowed the lives of billions of people, hundreds of millions on record by gun.
[01:26:33.277 --> 01:26:42.902]  And then I see the posing individuals at the shopping malls or on the streets, everyone, you know, looking at how everybody's dressed and trying to strut like peacocks.
[01:26:42.942 --> 01:26:45.864]  But you look in their eyes, you see the extreme insecurity.
[01:26:48.525 --> 01:26:53.288]  They look at you, especially if you're not insecure, and they look at you like there's something wrong with you.
[01:26:53.969 --> 01:26:56.450]  Because you're conscious, you're outwardly focused.
[01:27:00.396 --> 01:27:02.817]  You know, I get to where I can just see through people more and more.
[01:27:02.857 --> 01:27:03.978]  I can just see right into them.
[01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.338]  And it's very disquieting.
[01:27:05.398 --> 01:27:06.299]  It's very upsetting.
[01:27:07.239 --> 01:27:08.600]  Because I love everybody.
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:11.041]  You see, if you don't love other people, you don't love yourself.
[01:27:11.061 --> 01:27:11.902]  We're all a community.
[01:27:11.922 --> 01:27:12.882]  We're all intertwined.
[01:27:13.202 --> 01:27:14.483]  We're all connected to each other.
[01:27:19.305 --> 01:27:21.646]  You know, people joke around about glowing cats.
[01:27:21.706 --> 01:27:23.447]  I told you about glowing monkeys years ago.
[01:27:23.467 --> 01:27:24.287]  They're selling these.
[01:27:25.428 --> 01:27:26.588]  They're selling these in stores.
[01:27:27.289 --> 01:27:29.570]  They're extracting viral compounds from them.
[01:27:30.163 --> 01:27:35.145]  They can give you a shot that will go in and make you do whatever they want.
[01:27:35.185 --> 01:27:42.809]  They have viral preparations that will go in and make you never laugh again.
[01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:48.792]  They know the exact area of the brain and the virus will just target that and give you a limited micro-lobotomy.
[01:27:49.092 --> 01:27:51.473]  I've been telling you this for 10 years, so I was reading scientific reports.
[01:27:51.853 --> 01:27:53.054]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:27:53.817 --> 01:27:58.159]  And folks, I'm telling you, we're seeing evidence that they're already doing this to the population.
[01:27:58.179 --> 01:28:07.103]  In fact, we know they're doing it with the, quote, anti-drug use vaccines that are live viruses that literally eat the brain, eat sections of the brain.
[01:28:07.123 --> 01:28:16.388]  And then I see something like this out of the Washington Post today, scientific report, uh, synthetic DNA on the brink of yielding new life forms.
[01:28:18.409 --> 01:28:21.490]  And then I interview Nobel Prize winners and top scientists and they say that
[01:28:22.779 --> 01:28:24.800]  It's already given rise to super viruses.
[01:28:25.901 --> 01:28:27.842]  It's already given rise to super bacteria.
[01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:30.524]  It's already given rise to new life forms.
[01:28:32.445 --> 01:28:38.009]  And the way things are going right now, it may already be irreversible.
[01:28:39.329 --> 01:28:40.090]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.393 --> 01:28:45.333]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:47.395]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.315 --> 01:28:51.017]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.753 --> 01:29:04.416]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism, comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[01:29:04.536 --> 01:29:07.817]  Her face was the every face I've ever known.
[01:29:08.257 --> 01:29:09.957]  Her face was my own face.
[01:29:10.237 --> 01:29:14.778]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a movie the government does not want you to see.
[01:29:14.878 --> 01:29:17.399]  A political thriller ripped from today's headlines.
[01:29:17.479 --> 01:29:20.440]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government chipping and more.

[01:32:02.618 --> 01:32:12.264]  They railed against the crown, another ragtag band, declaring independence.
[01:32:15.476 --> 01:32:20.597]  They laid their bodies down on a bloody war.
[01:32:21.997 --> 01:32:24.418]  Liberty for their descendants.

[01:32:29.479 --> 01:32:32.299]  Thanks to the renegades, we're free today.
[01:32:47.272 --> 01:32:48.033]  Their time.
[01:32:49.434 --> 01:32:50.014]  Welcome back.
[01:32:52.095 --> 01:33:01.361]  Nick Harangi from Lee Archange, Philly, reportedly got a visit from the Secret Service.
[01:33:01.641 --> 01:33:12.027]  Temple University student Nick Harangi, founder of Philly 9-11 Truth, confronted Bill Clinton on Tuesday at a Hillary fundraiser and received a visit from the Secret Service agents at his parents' house.
[01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:30.480]  We're talking to him and We Are Change UK about what happened with Visor Consultancy's owner and former head of Scotland Yard, Andy Terrer, who was running drills of the exact same buses at the exact same places at the exact same time, trains, that were bombed on 7-7 two years ago in London.
[01:33:32.181 --> 01:33:33.722]  So we're going to talk to these gentlemen here in a moment.
[01:33:34.042 --> 01:33:37.064]  I don't want to break train of thought and not finish up what I was saying earlier.
[01:33:38.135 --> 01:33:43.417]  I'm going to give you my honest take on the Ron Paul campaign and where I think it's going, and where I think the movement's going.
[01:33:44.077 --> 01:33:59.703]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour, because I want to talk to these guests coming up, then go to a bunch more of your calls again for a big phone blitz, and then have time to give them some economic news, and then of course finish up with my take on what's happening to Ron Paul and the Freedom Movement, and put it into different categories for you, from my perspective.
[01:34:03.364 --> 01:34:06.085]  But finishing up the points that I was making
[01:34:07.745 --> 01:34:09.967]  Glow-in-the-dark cats that glow red and green.
[01:34:12.749 --> 01:34:16.792]  Glow-in-the-dark monkeys you can buy at the store.
[01:34:18.033 --> 01:34:19.755]  Cloned cats, dogs, cloned humans.
[01:34:19.775 --> 01:34:20.976]  It's all already going on.
[01:34:21.316 --> 01:34:26.100]  Half-human, half-chimpanzee, half-human, half, uh, grade-A.
[01:34:28.982 --> 01:34:29.663]  It's all going on.
[01:34:29.703 --> 01:34:30.924]  It's all inside of It Reports.
[01:34:31.564 --> 01:34:33.766]  But it's not been mainstream news until now.
[01:34:33.806 --> 01:34:35.127]  It's been going on since I woke up.
[01:34:37.572 --> 01:34:47.961]  And, you know, I'll be on a radio show and I'll talk about open-air testing of live AIDS virus they plan to, quote, turn into vaccine and then the people can't believe me and I even give them the footnotes of the mainstream articles and they can't believe it.
[01:34:50.464 --> 01:34:56.189]  I've told the story about I was picking up a pizza one time and this guy taps me on the back and says, I used to like you but you're a liar.
[01:34:56.249 --> 01:35:03.395]  I had biology at UT in the 70s and there's no such thing as cross-species genetic organisms and I just said,
[01:35:04.218 --> 01:35:05.879]  Hey man, I'm not lying to you.
[01:35:07.399 --> 01:35:08.680]  Just type in spider goats.
[01:35:10.921 --> 01:35:11.981]  All I do is tell the truth.
[01:35:12.521 --> 01:35:13.442]  All I do is research.
[01:35:13.782 --> 01:35:14.902]  All I do is warn you.
[01:35:17.103 --> 01:35:20.725]  And I can't because people can't handle it not talk about cross-species.
[01:35:21.265 --> 01:35:26.487]  By cross-species, you know, plant and animal, insect and animal, insect and plant, mixed together.
[01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:30.969]  I can't not talk about it just because you can't deal with it.
[01:35:31.684 --> 01:35:35.365]  I can't not talk about 9-11 just because people can't deal with it.
[01:35:36.025 --> 01:35:39.325]  Things are so bad we need to be as intense as possible.
[01:35:39.625 --> 01:35:41.946]  We need to fully face, myself included.
[01:35:42.226 --> 01:35:43.386]  I just go about my business.
[01:35:43.426 --> 01:35:46.667]  Most of the time I live my life like everything's fine and I'm ho-hum.
[01:35:46.687 --> 01:35:55.728]  We need to really consciously have it hit us that words can't put how bad and serious and out of control things already are.
[01:35:55.948 --> 01:35:58.609]  And that's just with our limited knowledge of what we know.
[01:35:58.849 --> 01:36:00.909]  In every case it's always worse than even I thought.
[01:36:04.281 --> 01:36:10.604]  And you need to know that I come to you on this radio show and I tell you the absolute truth as close to it as I can get.
[01:36:10.724 --> 01:36:12.285]  I'm attempting to tell you the absolute truth.
[01:36:12.485 --> 01:36:16.587]  That doesn't mean I'm not flawed, or that things aren't distorted, or that I'm not perfect.
[01:36:18.268 --> 01:36:18.889]  I'm not perfect.
[01:36:19.869 --> 01:36:22.911]  But I tell you, I get it closer and straighter than anybody else out there.
[01:36:23.091 --> 01:36:23.951]  And that scares me.
[01:36:24.832 --> 01:36:27.853]  Because I don't have some high and mighty view of myself.
[01:36:28.053 --> 01:36:31.435]  We need to get this data spread to everybody as quickly as possible.
[01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:33.316]  This is life and death.
[01:36:41.494 --> 01:36:46.276]  And so I see news reports like this one, scientific DNA on the brink of yielding new life forms.
[01:36:46.296 --> 01:36:47.076]  They've actually already done it.
[01:36:47.896 --> 01:36:56.320]  It's been 50 years since scientists first created DNA in a test tube, stretching ordinary chemical ingredients together to make life's most extraordinary molecule.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:06.604]  Until recently, however, even the most sophisticated laboratories could make only small snippets of DNA, an extra gene or two to be inserted into corn plants, for example, to help the plants ward off insects and tolerate drought.
[01:37:07.224 --> 01:37:10.085]  No, what they do is they insert other animal or
[01:37:11.147 --> 01:37:14.290]  plant or insect, insectoid genes into it.
[01:37:14.711 --> 01:37:21.597]  Now researchers are poised to cross a dramatic barrier to the creation of life forms driven by completely artificial DNA.
[01:37:22.758 --> 01:37:34.490]  Scientists in Maryland have already built the world's first entirely handcrafted chromosome, a large looping strand of DNA from scratch in a laboratory containing all the instructions a microbe needs to live and reproduce.
[01:37:36.503 --> 01:37:39.005]  Now, I'm just introducing this today.
[01:37:39.025 --> 01:37:43.790]  Again, it would take hours to even break it down and to give you any idea what's happening.
[01:37:43.810 --> 01:37:54.579]  There are already thousands of admitted cases of genetically crossed species.
[01:37:54.599 --> 01:37:55.420]  That's the most dangerous.
[01:37:56.639 --> 01:37:59.180]  Engineered plants, where they put viruses in the plants.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.661]  They put bacteria in the plants.
[01:38:00.681 --> 01:38:02.662]  They put bacteria genes in the plants.
[01:38:02.702 --> 01:38:04.823]  They put all these different things into it.
[01:38:04.843 --> 01:38:10.106]  Sometimes 50, 60, 70, 100 different animals and plants and bacteria and DNA pieces.
[01:38:10.486 --> 01:38:13.068]  And you make one change!
[01:38:14.128 --> 01:38:21.032]  You can change the one thing, the one expression you want, but then in each replication, thousands of new combinations are created.
[01:38:22.603 --> 01:38:38.696]  And it's already causing all these new illnesses and problems and allergies and diseases, and it's been linked to that, and it's absolute fact that Crohn's disease didn't exist 40 years ago, and that the vaccines, they're not contaminated, because that would mean it happened on accident.
[01:38:38.976 --> 01:38:41.418]  By design, are attacking people's guts.
[01:38:41.498 --> 01:38:42.459]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:44.481]  You're eating this stuff.
[01:38:48.107 --> 01:38:57.273]  And either the elite are completely insane and nuts and the system is out of control and the biotech companies don't care, or they're doing it by design.
[01:38:57.293 --> 01:39:02.596]  And then you go read Monsanto's public statements about, we're going to infect everything so we can take over everything.
[01:39:02.956 --> 01:39:05.418]  And then you realize they're saying they're doing it on purpose.
[01:39:05.738 --> 01:39:07.439]  These people are literally
[01:39:10.242 --> 01:39:20.011]  You know, you have this image of a demon or a devil as a child, or something with horns and a tail, or the Hollywood image of it likes to party and, you know, sex is tied to it and fun things.
[01:39:20.291 --> 01:39:22.293]  That's not even it, folks.
[01:39:23.794 --> 01:39:29.840]  It's like something out of The Fifth Element, where you've just got this dark force that approaches the planet and just wants to kill everybody.
[01:39:32.128 --> 01:39:38.092]  Or the analogy of Independence Day when they got the alien in the jail cell, you know, contained in the containment unit.
[01:39:38.352 --> 01:39:39.533]  The president says, what can we do?
[01:39:39.593 --> 01:39:40.393]  How can we work with you?
[01:39:40.633 --> 01:39:41.734]  How can you stop attacking us?
[01:39:41.774 --> 01:39:42.595]  What do you want from us?
[01:39:43.135 --> 01:39:44.016]  And he says, die.
[01:39:44.096 --> 01:39:44.976]  I want you to die.
[01:39:52.241 --> 01:39:53.782]  Like the James Bond movie, Doctor No.
[01:39:54.082 --> 01:39:57.164]  He's got him strapped into a torture chair and he says, do you expect me to talk?
[01:39:57.184 --> 01:39:58.265]  And he says, no, Mr. Bond.
[01:39:58.545 --> 01:39:59.385]  I expect you to die.
[01:39:59.405 --> 01:40:00.526]  And he dumps him in the shark pit.
[01:40:02.483 --> 01:40:15.875]  I mean, what do all these biotech owners and leaders and people think when their own scientists leave them and quit them and say, my God, we didn't think mutations after the first trimester were possible.
[01:40:16.836 --> 01:40:23.202]  Mutations happened in the genetic replication and the basic blueprint being replicated during development of even the zygote.
[01:40:26.590 --> 01:40:34.674]  The most base levels of cellular replication and that beautiful, magical thing that happens.
[01:40:41.838 --> 01:40:45.780]  Now, the rats and guinea pigs, they're giving all these GMO foods.
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:46.920]  They knew this 30 years ago.
[01:40:49.182 --> 01:40:55.445]  They give them the GMO food we're now eating, and they have mutations while they're adults!
[01:40:57.699 --> 01:41:03.464]  You know, kind of the old Hollywood image of somebody growing, you know, tentacles and tumors or whatever, or an eyeball on the side of their head.
[01:41:03.764 --> 01:41:06.466]  I mean, that type of stuff is happening!
[01:41:11.811 --> 01:41:13.012]  And it's so huge!
[01:41:13.832 --> 01:41:14.833]  It's so massive!
[01:41:15.354 --> 01:41:19.757]  And then people can't deal with the government killing 2,800 and something people on 9-11?
[01:41:19.857 --> 01:41:21.899]  When all the evidence proves it?
[01:41:23.228 --> 01:41:28.312]  When they would take 4,000 plus American children and put them in radiation chambers and kill them and that's declassified?
[01:41:28.812 --> 01:41:31.954]  I mean, some schmuck tells you... Excuse me, I'm trying not to be like that.
[01:41:32.294 --> 01:41:44.883]  Some poor person in denial who's ignorant tells you that they couldn't do that when they had the motive and the means and the history and wrote memos about how they needed terror attacks to get their agenda through.
[01:41:45.364 --> 01:41:48.946]  They'd kill little babies, but they wouldn't kill people on 9-11.
[01:41:49.347 --> 01:41:51.088]  Stop being fools!
[01:41:52.657 --> 01:41:57.121]  And to all the police officers, and all the military, and all the people, I've made a lot of mistakes.
[01:41:57.161 --> 01:41:57.962]  I've attacked you.
[01:41:58.322 --> 01:42:01.505]  I've, at an animal level, been threatened by the tyranny you're bringing forward.
[01:42:01.925 --> 01:42:03.766]  And, of course, they mix a lot of good stuff you do in with it.
[01:42:03.947 --> 01:42:04.827]  That's how tyranny works.
[01:42:05.128 --> 01:42:06.148]  It looks reasonable at first.
[01:42:07.069 --> 01:42:08.310]  I care about you.
[01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:10.512]  Your children are being hurt by this stuff.
[01:42:10.592 --> 01:42:11.873]  You're being hurt by this stuff.
[01:42:12.314 --> 01:42:14.936]  These people are very evil that are running things.
[01:42:18.951 --> 01:42:21.052]  And I tell you, it makes me believe the Bible more than ever.
[01:42:21.092 --> 01:42:37.578]  And I don't mean the fake preachers or the religious system, but the things the Bible talks about, about abominations, you know, the elite creating talking machines, and how they would mix all the, you know, the blood, the genetics, the seed together and make all these horrible creatures.
[01:42:37.878 --> 01:42:38.818]  That's all in Revelation.
[01:42:38.838 --> 01:42:39.798]  That's all in Ezekiel.
[01:42:40.919 --> 01:42:41.539]  That's all in there.
[01:42:41.559 --> 01:42:44.120]  I mean, you can debate where it came from,
[01:42:45.006 --> 01:42:46.046]  This stuff happened before?
[01:42:46.146 --> 01:42:47.206]  Was Atlantis real?
[01:42:47.346 --> 01:42:47.927]  I don't know!
[01:42:48.287 --> 01:42:49.587]  How did they put it in this book?
[01:42:50.407 --> 01:42:53.788]  Just secularly, I'm saying, the stuff in there is incredible.
[01:42:54.328 --> 01:43:00.249]  Giant iron birds dropping huge, huge black eggs that explode into fire.
[01:43:00.809 --> 01:43:08.790]  I mean, you know, how are the Aztecs making thousands of little figurines of 747s with perfect windows down the side?
[01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:09.950]  And those are real!
[01:43:11.491 --> 01:43:13.431]  Those were hauled back to Spain 400 years ago!
[01:43:15.817 --> 01:43:17.462]  I don't know what's going on, folks.
[01:43:17.924 --> 01:43:18.365]  I don't know.
[01:43:18.385 --> 01:43:20.411]  I cover what I can prove, what I can document.
[01:43:21.313 --> 01:43:21.955]  All I know is...
[01:43:23.123 --> 01:43:28.204]  But the Bible talks about people who love to kill, steal, and destroy, and inventing new wickedness.
[01:43:28.224 --> 01:43:33.406]  That's what they do, and running around trying to be God, and hating the creation.
[01:43:33.426 --> 01:43:34.526]  Let's say you don't believe in God.
[01:43:34.786 --> 01:43:36.407]  This elite hates the creation.
[01:43:36.687 --> 01:43:42.968]  They run around saying they're guardians of the Earth, and want to help the planet, and let's ban CO2 and tax it, when that's good for the Earth.
[01:43:43.188 --> 01:43:52.531]  Meanwhile, they're engaged in millions of absolute abominations against the very genetic code of the planet.
[01:43:53.695 --> 01:43:58.057]  I mean, they're just in a frothing, berserking orgy.
[01:43:59.698 --> 01:44:07.682]  I mean, picture the Elite as a Viking berserker with a huge double-edged battle axe, running around in a China shop.
[01:44:09.441 --> 01:44:35.329]  Just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,
[01:44:36.730 --> 01:44:38.191]  Covering it all up in the media.
[01:44:38.371 --> 01:44:40.073]  The average person in the media can't even grasp this.
[01:44:40.093 --> 01:44:41.254]  They don't even have to cover it up.
[01:44:46.858 --> 01:44:47.919]  I've got to get serious.
[01:44:48.079 --> 01:44:48.960]  You've got to get serious.
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:50.982]  You've got to recommit to realize how serious this is.
[01:44:51.002 --> 01:44:51.182]  Alright.
[01:44:51.422 --> 01:44:52.883]  They've been holding for 10 minutes and I apologize.
[01:44:52.943 --> 01:44:53.944]  I'll keep them in the next segment.
[01:44:54.285 --> 01:44:55.606]  I just want quick reports from them.
[01:44:56.346 --> 01:44:59.309]  Let's bring them both up together right now.
[01:44:59.329 --> 01:45:02.952]  I really appreciate all of their work.
[01:45:03.152 --> 01:45:04.493]  Temple University student Nick
[01:45:05.692 --> 01:45:09.453]  Karanji and of course Simon Moore from We Are Change UK.
[01:45:10.013 --> 01:45:14.314]  Nick Karanji is from Temple University and he's the founder of 9-11 Truth Philly.
[01:45:14.834 --> 01:45:17.335]  Earlier I said We Are Change because I was just told that by a caller.
[01:45:17.455 --> 01:45:18.475]  It's 9-11 Truth Philly.
[01:45:20.776 --> 01:45:21.776]  Let's bring you both up.
[01:45:21.836 --> 01:45:23.036]  Gentlemen, you can say hi to each other.
[01:45:23.056 --> 01:45:24.977]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:45:25.197 --> 01:45:25.557]  How are you?
[01:45:26.017 --> 01:45:26.297]  Hi, Nick.
[01:45:26.857 --> 01:45:27.037]  Good.
[01:45:27.097 --> 01:45:28.217]  I apologize for grabbing you whole.
[01:45:28.257 --> 01:45:29.498]  I just had to finish that thought.
[01:45:29.538 --> 01:45:30.318]  I didn't even finish it.
[01:45:30.758 --> 01:45:34.679]  But just, this Secret Service thing is real serious right now.
[01:45:35.679 --> 01:45:39.321]  Uh, Mr. Moore, so let's real fast from, um, Nick Karangi.
[01:45:39.361 --> 01:45:41.162]  Nick, tell us exactly what happened in a nutshell.
[01:45:41.763 --> 01:45:41.983]  Sure.
[01:45:42.263 --> 01:45:51.108]  Um, Tuesday of this past week, I attended a Hillary Clinton rally, uh, wherein Bill Clinton was the guest of honor speaking on her behalf.
[01:45:51.448 --> 01:45:53.950]  And after the event, he was shaking hands.
[01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:57.492]  And I do have video footage of this, which will be released.
[01:45:58.393 --> 01:46:10.260]  I was able to shake his hand, and I simply made an allusion to what another group he had done to another 9-11 truth group, which was, he had said, you know, an inside job, how dare you?
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:16.183]  So, I sort of flipped that on him, and I said, Bilderberg, New World Order, how dare you?
[01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:17.724]  How dare you?
[01:46:18.284 --> 01:46:20.685]  And I repeated that maybe one or two times.
[01:46:20.705 --> 01:46:23.367]  And then I left, and on my way out,
[01:46:24.212 --> 01:46:28.456]  I was immediately stonewalled right in front of me by a Secret Service agent.
[01:46:28.737 --> 01:46:32.560]  I didn't realize he was at the time, but it turns out to be the same one who visited me.
[01:46:32.781 --> 01:46:37.765]  And I said to him, sir, you need to learn about the Bilderberg and about these affiliations that are destroying America.
[01:46:38.466 --> 01:46:39.607]  And I proceeded to leave.
[01:46:39.988 --> 01:46:42.490]  And I got in my car with a group of guys who were there.
[01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:45.093]  Some were filming and some were just in solidarity.
[01:46:45.573 --> 01:46:47.295]  And we went around to the
[01:46:47.870 --> 01:47:12.808]  the back of the building or another street near it and uh... we saw that you know they usually have a caravan from which they exit so we waited on the edge of the street i'm not within the secured zone which would be they would later alleged that i had and uh... we greeted him on his way out you know thanks so much thanks and then this past friday uh... i was in my home in the afternoon and i was uh... i guess abruptly
[01:47:13.757 --> 01:47:13.877]  Yeah.
[01:47:28.758 --> 01:47:29.098]  Uh, yeah.
[01:47:29.478 --> 01:47:29.798]  We're here.
[01:47:29.938 --> 01:47:31.379]  I said, what is the nature of your visit?
[01:47:31.399 --> 01:47:34.880]  And they said, we're here about the incident with Bill Clinton, um, the other day.
[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:35.981]  So I said, okay.
[01:47:36.341 --> 01:47:46.024]  And, uh, they asked to have a seat and, you know, I agreed and we sat down and then the nearby living room, we started to talk about, they said, basically, um, you know, we're, we're concerned about your activities.
[01:47:46.284 --> 01:47:55.387]  Um, we've looked into your, your most recent things with the presidential debates and now this Bill Clinton incident, and, uh, we're concerned for, you know, the safety of, of the president.
[01:47:55.407 --> 01:47:56.908]  And we want to make sure that you're not violent.
[01:47:57.532 --> 01:47:58.212]  I said violent.
[01:47:58.592 --> 01:48:01.333]  I mean, I never... I was within my First Amendment.
[01:48:01.353 --> 01:48:02.953]  I was just simply expressing myself.
[01:48:03.373 --> 01:48:12.335]  Look, look, if you go back to Bill Clinton and Hillary, they wrote the book on somebody would say something to Hillary and she would say arrest them for just saying something she thought was rude.
[01:48:12.975 --> 01:48:14.316]  This is what these people do.
[01:48:14.996 --> 01:48:16.356]  They're thugs, but go ahead.
[01:48:16.376 --> 01:48:18.317]  Yeah, it was pure intimidation.
[01:48:18.357 --> 01:48:22.838]  So, you know, they started asking... I mean, the things that they asked me were so appalling.
[01:48:23.458 --> 01:48:24.098]  They said first,
[01:48:24.778 --> 01:48:26.720]  You know, we're concerned for the safety of the president.
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:30.845]  And my mom said, you know, we don't even, we don't own any guns in this house.
[01:48:30.865 --> 01:48:31.646]  He's not violent.
[01:48:32.086 --> 01:48:35.450]  And they said, well, you know, we just want to make sure that he's not a threat.
[01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:37.893]  And they said, well, would you ever consider buying a gun?
[01:48:38.173 --> 01:48:41.797]  And I said, not necessarily, but it's within my amendment rights.
[01:48:42.741 --> 01:48:44.922]  You shouldn't even have talked to him, sir.
[01:48:44.942 --> 01:48:54.287]  I mean, I would have just said, listen, First Amendment guys, you need to go, because they were all recording you in there, and they'll even edit it together and stuff, just to have you saying, gun.
[01:48:54.307 --> 01:48:56.088]  You know, you never know what they'll do.
[01:48:56.568 --> 01:49:09.274]  Nixon tried to stage terror attacks on his own RNC meeting back in the 70s, and then that got exposed, and he had to stop, because see, they're always looking for patsies, too, so they can stage something and then later blame it on you.
[01:49:10.245 --> 01:49:10.365]  Right.
[01:49:10.445 --> 01:49:13.787]  And they said, they said, well, would you ever use violence against an official if you couldn't?
[01:49:13.807 --> 01:49:19.831]  You know, I explained what I was doing there, confronting him about, you know, his politics and the things I disagree with his career.
[01:49:19.851 --> 01:49:24.835]  I said, well, if you couldn't, you know, I guess, resolve it there, would you ever, you know, consider using violence?
[01:49:24.855 --> 01:49:26.716]  Assassinating him, essentially, is what they said.
[01:49:26.736 --> 01:49:28.057]  And I said, of course not.
[01:49:28.077 --> 01:49:29.458]  I would never use violence.
[01:49:29.898 --> 01:49:33.521]  And then they proceeded to say, well, would you use violence against one of his security agents?
[01:49:33.621 --> 01:49:34.922]  And I said, of course not.
[01:49:40.865 --> 01:49:43.126]  From We Are Change UK.
[01:49:43.146 --> 01:49:44.486]  Then I'm going to get into your calls.
[01:49:44.546 --> 01:49:47.767]  More on Ron Paul, more on the economy in the next hour.
[01:49:48.667 --> 01:49:50.027]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:50.047 --> 01:49:52.348]  Vital News and Information straight ahead.
[01:49:54.368 --> 01:49:55.769]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:55.789 --> 01:49:57.869]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.610 --> 01:50:03.091]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:03.511 --> 01:50:05.251]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:50:05.451 --> 01:50:08.492]  Both their objectives being world domination.
[01:50:09.119 --> 01:50:11.541]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.281 --> 01:50:19.707]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:19.727 --> 01:50:27.612]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:28.092 --> 01:50:31.395]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.955 --> 01:50:34.016]  Build a very good space to make progress for the world.
[01:50:34.516 --> 01:50:35.657]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.677 --> 01:50:36.437]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.457 --> 01:50:37.537]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.738 --> 01:50:38.478]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.718 --> 01:50:39.538]  That's what I have to do.
[01:50:39.878 --> 01:50:44.420]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:50:51.383 --> 01:50:52.544]  You have been warned.
[01:50:54.298 --> 01:51:03.383]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:03.623 --> 01:51:14.849]  Black murky elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:20.892]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:51:21.132 --> 01:51:27.797]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:28.017 --> 01:51:34.823]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:35.103 --> 01:51:36.864]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:51:37.124 --> 01:51:39.326]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements Kit.
[01:51:39.386 --> 01:51:40.888]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.

[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.521]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:51:55.661 --> 01:52:00.842]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:52:01.022 --> 01:52:02.362]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:52:02.622 --> 01:52:10.784]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:52:11.025 --> 01:52:16.746]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:52:16.926 --> 01:52:18.707]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:52:18.767 --> 01:52:20.929]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:52:20.949 --> 01:52:25.312]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:27.654]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:52:27.714 --> 01:52:35.480]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:36.381]  We're good to go.
[01:52:57.642 --> 01:52:59.902]  Look, it's real simple.
[01:52:59.982 --> 01:53:03.763]  Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have Ron Paul signs torn down.
[01:53:03.803 --> 01:53:09.545]  They tell people at universities they can't have them at public rallies.
[01:53:21.582 --> 01:53:26.003]  They're getting sick of people going and confronting them at public events or during question and answers.
[01:53:26.683 --> 01:53:31.804]  So they're just trying to use you as a chilling effect, knowing you would then talk about it to scare everybody.
[01:53:32.324 --> 01:53:40.966]  So the answer is, people just need to continue to engage in their First Amendment rights, to go out and confront Bill Clinton.
[01:53:41.026 --> 01:53:45.847]  I mean, I got arrested when I asked George Bush about counsel on foreign relations and Federal Reserve.
[01:53:45.887 --> 01:53:46.508]  I was very polite.
[01:53:46.548 --> 01:53:48.008]  I said, Sir, at the end of his speech,
[01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:49.489]  Videos on the web.
[01:53:49.549 --> 01:53:51.790]  I said, sir, don't you care about this country?
[01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:56.771]  Isn't it the CFR and Federal Reserve that's destroying this nation and taking us over for European interest?
[01:53:57.412 --> 01:53:58.312]  And they just arrested me.
[01:53:58.712 --> 01:53:59.532]  Actually, kidnapped me.
[01:53:59.692 --> 01:54:01.713]  They just drove me around for an hour and threw me on the side of the road.
[01:54:02.433 --> 01:54:03.333]  Almost broke my shoulder.
[01:54:04.113 --> 01:54:06.394]  But we're going to go to We Are Change UK here in a moment.
[01:54:06.434 --> 01:54:08.175]  We'll hold you over, both of you.
[01:54:08.695 --> 01:54:14.356]  But we're talking to a Temple University student and founder of Philly 9-11 Truth, Nick Karangi.
[01:54:14.416 --> 01:54:15.457]  Nick, how did this end?
[01:54:15.517 --> 01:54:16.217]  What else did they say?
[01:54:17.008 --> 01:54:31.754]  Okay, more so, this man in a black overcoat and the other in a brown jacket were talking to me about, they said, would you ever, I referenced the Constitution maybe three or more times, and they said, well, would you ever kill for the Constitution?
[01:54:31.774 --> 01:54:39.597]  And I said, my God, and I just replied, that's what I said, I said, you gentlemen are going to need to speak to my lawyer if you're going to continue with this sort of rhetoric.
[01:54:41.610 --> 01:54:43.252]  They're like, you know, I just answered the question.
[01:54:43.272 --> 01:54:49.218]  I said, once again, I will never use violence or, you know, or hurt somebody, you know, for my beliefs.
[01:54:49.438 --> 01:54:50.599]  And I emphasize that.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.181]  And they still proceeded.
[01:54:52.281 --> 01:54:55.404]  Well, they said, OK, well, we just want to make sure you're not going to hurt anybody.
[01:54:55.785 --> 01:55:03.833]  They said, well, you should be aware if you're going to go out to these political events, that if you create a disturbance and if you were to be arrested in the process,
[01:55:04.659 --> 01:55:05.119]  That's good to hear.
[01:55:19.517 --> 01:55:20.638]  What does Limbaugh say?
[01:55:21.038 --> 01:55:22.158]  What does Savage say?
[01:55:22.278 --> 01:55:23.679]  What does Michael Reagan say?
[01:55:23.959 --> 01:55:25.120]  What does Michael Medved say?
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:32.043]  They all say, fire 9-11 truthers, fire Ron Paul supporters, arrest them, they're terrorists.
[01:55:32.083 --> 01:55:35.225]  You see, they're now entering the mode.
[01:55:36.225 --> 01:55:38.666]  They trained third world countries how to do this, so they know.
[01:55:40.727 --> 01:55:42.008]  Look, just don't talk to these people.
[01:55:42.751 --> 01:55:51.858]  You know, they predict a drug-dealing person who's presided over the murder of hundreds, Bill Clinton, who's just literally a maggot-infested soul.
[01:55:52.658 --> 01:55:56.981]  I would never want anything to happen to Bill Clinton, because I would not want to turn that horrible creature into a martyr.
[01:55:58.102 --> 01:55:59.103]  They're nothing but puppets.
[01:55:59.743 --> 01:56:01.125]  We will continue to expose them.
[01:56:01.285 --> 01:56:02.245]  They're desperate, sir.
[01:56:02.546 --> 01:56:03.046]  We're winning.
[01:56:04.141 --> 01:56:05.523]  Absolutely.
[01:56:05.783 --> 01:56:10.789]  The only thing is the reason why I really didn't expel them immediately was because I had my mother in the house with me.
[01:56:10.849 --> 01:56:20.420]  She suffers from cognitive dissonance at times and she knows these things are happening, but she fails to recognize them in their true form, I believe.
[01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:27.071]  I went through it simply to resolve the issue.
[01:56:27.111 --> 01:56:28.852]  Here's an example.
[01:56:29.372 --> 01:56:35.875]  They blocked off about three miles before Bush's Ranch, a major farm-to-market road that literally thousands of people go down a day.
[01:56:35.895 --> 01:56:41.318]  I mean, it was cars every minute, every 30 seconds, sometimes four or five of them behind each other.
[01:56:42.139 --> 01:56:50.503]  And we drove up to the checkpoint, and literally, if you didn't live down that farm-to-market road, you had to drive about 30 miles around to be able to get to your house.
[01:56:50.923 --> 01:56:52.044]  They just don't let anybody through.
[01:56:52.702 --> 01:56:58.184]  And so we pulled up to get it on tape, and they're real rude.
[01:56:58.204 --> 01:56:59.084]  Just, who are you?
[01:56:59.105 --> 01:56:59.885]  Get out of here!
[01:57:00.265 --> 01:57:01.625]  See, usually they were at least polite.
[01:57:01.665 --> 01:57:05.767]  It's all about, we're the scum slaves, they're there to guard the mafiadons.
[01:57:06.847 --> 01:57:07.648]  Okay?
[01:57:07.688 --> 01:57:09.488]  But, so I mean, did they finally get out of your house?
[01:57:10.049 --> 01:57:17.632]  Yes, they did leave, and before they left, I made it known that their duty is to protect the people and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:57:17.652 --> 01:57:18.352]  Did they agree with you?
[01:57:19.262 --> 01:57:21.784]  Um, they nodded complicitly and they laughed.
[01:57:21.844 --> 01:57:23.104]  Did they give you their cards?
[01:57:23.745 --> 01:57:24.605]  I did get a card, yeah.
[01:57:24.685 --> 01:57:26.967]  I want their names on air when we get back.
[01:57:28.768 --> 01:57:31.169]  Alright, we're going to be right back and we'll go to We Are Change UK as well.
[01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:32.690]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:34.872]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.393 --> 01:57:54.556]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:55.216 --> 01:57:56.037]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.797 --> 01:57:57.718]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.378 --> 01:58:02.281]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.541 --> 01:58:06.663]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.705 --> 01:58:09.885]  Alright, we're back live.
[01:58:10.666 --> 01:58:16.530]  Talking to Nick Perangi, Temple University student, Philadelphia, founder of Philly 9-11 Troop.
[01:58:17.788 --> 01:58:21.349]  Links are going up on JonesReport.com right now for the story and the information.
[01:58:22.429 --> 01:58:24.410]  We've also got We Are Change UK taking action.
[01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:25.910]  I appreciate him holding patiently.
[01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:29.071]  Finishing up, so they left your house.
[01:58:29.891 --> 01:58:33.572]  I mean, do you want to give this guy's name to people, know on record who this was?
[01:58:33.592 --> 01:58:37.193]  I mean, because I think when they crossed the line, was just kept saying, will you be violent?
[01:58:37.213 --> 01:58:37.813]  Will you be violent?
[01:58:37.833 --> 01:58:38.813]  When you said no, no, no.
[01:58:39.333 --> 01:58:41.214]  Claiming you were in a security zone when you weren't.
[01:58:41.883 --> 01:58:43.804]  Now they make whole city security zones, by the way.
[01:58:44.364 --> 01:58:48.346]  And then also saying, well, you don't want this to hurt your record, getting arrested if you make a disturbance.
[01:58:49.326 --> 01:58:54.048]  You know, now Fox News calls for tasering and beating people who ask questions.
[01:58:54.068 --> 01:58:55.869]  I mean, that's what America's about.
[01:58:55.909 --> 01:58:56.549]  It's about that.
[01:58:57.210 --> 01:59:00.431]  I mean, they have Dick Cheney's Secret Service, quote, have town hall meetings.
[01:59:00.911 --> 01:59:06.874]  And anybody, they run plates in the thing and find out if you're a Democrat and arrest you if you're in there just for being there.
[01:59:07.532 --> 01:59:09.073]  They've been losing lawsuits over this.
[01:59:09.574 --> 01:59:15.778]  So just to make sure, do you want to give the guys a name and info out?
[01:59:16.278 --> 01:59:16.899]  Preferably not.
[01:59:16.939 --> 01:59:17.619]  I'll give a name.
[01:59:17.659 --> 01:59:19.040]  I don't think we need to give out a number.
[01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:20.962]  Oh no, I'm not saying give the number out.
[01:59:20.982 --> 01:59:21.802]  Yeah, what's his name?
[01:59:22.623 --> 01:59:23.784]  There were two agents there.
[01:59:24.444 --> 01:59:30.629]  One was Charles Holliday and the other... What's interesting is Charles, when I asked him for his card, he said he didn't have one.
[01:59:31.329 --> 01:59:32.050]  And I said, well...
[01:59:32.595 --> 01:59:33.996]  At least give me your name.
[01:59:34.016 --> 01:59:38.199]  Yeah, by the way, they're supposed to give identification, but see, they go back to the quote, secret service.
[01:59:39.079 --> 01:59:41.701]  And so it's all part of this situation.
[01:59:42.041 --> 01:59:47.945]  Charles... Yeah, he gave his other partner's card, which I identified him as Timothy.
[01:59:48.966 --> 01:59:53.368]  He crossed out the name on the card pretty viciously and wrote his name above it.
[01:59:53.889 --> 01:59:58.552]  But I identified them both as, one was Charles Holliday, the one who did the crossing out,
[01:59:59.548 --> 02:00:06.211]  I mean I had some nuts send me a threat to George Bush and I thought it was a setup and I wasn't about to have people sending me stuff and so I sent it to the Secret Service
[02:00:19.244 --> 02:00:21.085]  And man, I'd not enjoy talking to them on the telephone.
[02:00:21.105 --> 02:00:23.146]  That was about seven years ago, eight years ago.
[02:00:23.526 --> 02:00:24.907]  And they went and arrested the guy.
[02:00:25.467 --> 02:00:30.389]  Turned out he'd done a bunch of other threats in Tennessee, and he went to prison, and it was in the newspaper.
[02:00:32.350 --> 02:00:34.531]  So... Because I thought it was a setup.
[02:00:34.551 --> 02:00:42.134]  I mean, I'm not about to... I mean, I would never, never... They don't run anything.
[02:00:42.154 --> 02:00:43.535]  These presidents are nobodies.
[02:00:44.695 --> 02:00:45.756]  They're just little front men.
[02:00:46.829 --> 02:00:49.490]  You know, we're not the ones that are the feds that stage terror attacks.
[02:00:50.111 --> 02:00:54.913]  And the troops out, so... Listen, let's go ahead and bring up We Are Change UK.
[02:00:57.314 --> 02:00:59.195]  Simon Moore, what do you think of what you just heard?
[02:01:00.456 --> 02:01:02.097]  Well, it sounds pretty disturbing, really.
[02:01:03.677 --> 02:01:04.698]  But not surprising.
[02:01:05.792 --> 02:01:11.097]  Um, given what seems to be happening in both the United States and the UK at the moment.
[02:01:11.538 --> 02:01:12.018]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:12.038 --> 02:01:17.043]  In the UK, if you just go out and talk to people on the street or videotape anything, they come up and put you in a database.
[02:01:17.704 --> 02:01:18.365]  They sure do.
[02:01:18.385 --> 02:01:26.513]  Um, in fact, I was picked out of a crowd, um, not so long ago and, uh, detained under the Terrorism Act.
[02:01:27.053 --> 02:01:28.435]  Yeah, let's be clear about this.
[02:01:29.379 --> 02:01:32.441]  Uh, it isn't just like the Secret Service now for the President anywhere.
[02:01:33.021 --> 02:01:34.703]  It's like the Soviet Union, how they started out.
[02:01:34.723 --> 02:01:38.245]  They just come up if you're talking to people, going, oh, there's five of you on the street talking.
[02:01:39.085 --> 02:01:40.466]  Uh, are you involved in terrorism?
[02:01:40.506 --> 02:01:41.747]  And then they put you in a database.
[02:01:41.987 --> 02:01:42.908]  That happened to me.
[02:01:42.928 --> 02:01:46.670]  I mean, I would be politely interviewing somebody out front at the Hard Rock Cafe.
[02:01:46.690 --> 02:01:49.772]  And they'd have confidence, walk over and go, all right, turn the camera off.
[02:01:49.992 --> 02:01:50.793]  Up against the wall.
[02:01:51.373 --> 02:01:52.774]  Gonna have a discussion with you now, mate.
[02:01:54.179 --> 02:01:56.320]  Why are you having a camera on the street?
[02:01:56.641 --> 02:01:59.342]  And I'm like, well, there's millions of cameras in your city, I'm media.
[02:01:59.842 --> 02:02:02.484]  You're not allowed to do that, not allowed to tape without permission.
[02:02:03.084 --> 02:02:05.206]  I mean, how did the UK just overnight turn into that?
[02:02:06.166 --> 02:02:09.648]  Well, there's a lot of misuse of legislation here.
[02:02:09.688 --> 02:02:15.972]  We have an act called the Antisocial Behaviour Order, or the Antisocial Dispersal Order.
[02:02:17.231 --> 02:02:25.377]  And it's designed for if you offend, supposedly offend anybody in a group setting, then they can plead to leave.
[02:02:25.397 --> 02:02:29.480]  Now you see, we've always talked about terror databases, all of this.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:30.281]  It's now happening.
[02:02:31.021 --> 02:02:32.042]  See, it's now happening.
[02:02:32.722 --> 02:02:35.364]  There's almost a million Americans on the terror watch list.
[02:02:36.165 --> 02:02:41.028]  Checking your watch on an aircraft, taking a photograph, or ordering a special meal.
[02:02:41.048 --> 02:02:43.230]  For the rest of your life, you're listed as a terrorist.
[02:02:46.539 --> 02:02:47.961]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:47.981 --> 02:02:50.084]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.785 --> 02:02:55.010]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:55.691 --> 02:02:57.814]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:02:58.515 --> 02:03:00.778]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:03:01.298 --> 02:03:03.722]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.481 --> 02:03:11.988]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.831 --> 02:03:19.695]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:19.715 --> 02:03:23.599]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:24.139 --> 02:03:26.221]  Bill Burgess is making great progress in the world.
[02:03:26.701 --> 02:03:27.862]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.882 --> 02:03:28.623]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.643 --> 02:03:29.724]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.924 --> 02:03:30.685]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.905 --> 02:03:31.946]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:04:45.467 --> 02:04:46.228]  Terrorism!
[02:04:46.388 --> 02:04:47.128]  Terrorism!
[02:04:47.228 --> 02:04:53.292]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:55.133]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:04:55.393 --> 02:04:57.875]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:04:58.255 --> 02:05:12.824]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:05:12.864 --> 02:05:13.204]  government.
[02:05:13.364 --> 02:05:15.145]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:05:15.545 --> 02:05:21.446]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:05:21.566 --> 02:05:26.067]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:05:33.708 --> 02:05:35.369]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:05:46.279 --> 02:05:48.461]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.021 --> 02:05:51.903]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.565 --> 02:06:10.436]  It had just started in the last few months in 2005 and I would literally be politely, nicely on a street corner interviewing people about a week after the DeMendez shooting had happened and they shot the innocent Brazilian man.
[02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.277]  It was a hit for some reason.
[02:06:12.857 --> 02:06:15.099]  They shot on him and shot him 12 times in the head.
[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:19.601]  I'd be interviewing the fruit stand lady and cops would just say, you're not allowed to videotape.
[02:06:19.621 --> 02:06:20.401]  And I'd say, what's the law?
[02:06:20.421 --> 02:06:21.621]  And they just said, do what I say.
[02:06:22.881 --> 02:06:24.521]  See, that's what tyranny is.
[02:06:24.601 --> 02:06:30.822]  It's just when the system is all focused on the average individual and there's really not any law, it's just their own discretion.
[02:06:31.303 --> 02:06:33.263]  Then I'd be outside the Hard Rock Cafe.
[02:06:33.303 --> 02:06:35.383]  I'd be outside, you know, at a square.
[02:06:37.084 --> 02:06:37.924]  Not just bullhorning.
[02:06:37.944 --> 02:06:40.644]  They came over there too and kept saying, well, you're allowed to bullhorn.
[02:06:41.104 --> 02:06:42.905]  The law doesn't go into effect for a week.
[02:06:42.985 --> 02:06:43.845]  They just passed a law.
[02:06:43.905 --> 02:06:45.545]  No more demonstrations basically in London.
[02:06:46.354 --> 02:06:47.395]  Yeah, no more free speech.
[02:06:48.136 --> 02:06:54.423]  But they said, yeah, we know that goes into effect in a week, but we're just going to stand in front of you and don't have that bullhorn on while we stand in front of you.
[02:06:54.703 --> 02:06:57.145]  Then I'd move the bullhorn and they'd stand back in front of it again.
[02:06:58.267 --> 02:07:08.397]  See, thinking that protecting the state, thinking going along with the system, minding us like we're a bunch of children, going back to We Are Change UK dovetailing with what happened to Philly 9-11 Truth,
[02:07:10.042 --> 02:07:13.724]  Yeah, you got detained under the New Terror Act, didn't you?
[02:07:13.784 --> 02:07:14.825]  And now they want to expand it.
[02:07:14.865 --> 02:07:16.946]  First it's a month, then 56 days.
[02:07:16.966 --> 02:07:18.326]  Now they say they want unlimited.
[02:07:18.587 --> 02:07:20.628]  Just disappear, not even tell anyone they grabbed you.
[02:07:21.348 --> 02:07:22.108]  Tell us about that.
[02:07:22.168 --> 02:07:25.910]  And tell us about yourself, too, Simon Moore.
[02:07:26.691 --> 02:07:27.011]  Sure.
[02:07:27.091 --> 02:07:29.532]  Well, I'm part of We Are Change UK.
[02:07:30.152 --> 02:07:33.634]  And we're a sort of small group of quite determined activists.
[02:07:34.655 --> 02:07:36.556]  And we campaign and
[02:07:37.501 --> 02:07:42.265]  Demonstrate on a whole range of subjects, including civil liberties.
[02:07:42.505 --> 02:07:45.468]  And you go and you upset the sheep.
[02:07:45.548 --> 02:07:48.971]  You go to events or on the street and you ask people questions.
[02:07:49.391 --> 02:07:50.552]  Oh, you must be arrested.
[02:07:50.572 --> 02:07:51.173]  Tell us about it.
[02:07:51.653 --> 02:08:00.220]  Well, I was actually also, we're also detained in Leicester Square, which is the place where a lot of the movie premieres take place in London.
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:03.043]  You have an Odeon cinema there.
[02:08:03.892 --> 02:08:06.893]  And we were there with a bunch of banners and signs and whatnot.
[02:08:07.233 --> 02:08:10.995]  And there was a movie premiere going on starring Tom Cruise.
[02:08:12.155 --> 02:08:15.817]  And we'd just come out of a pub next to Leicester Square.
[02:08:16.617 --> 02:08:19.838]  And we were just kind of standing watching the crowds.
[02:08:19.898 --> 02:08:22.619]  Didn't intend to do anything at that precise moment.
[02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:28.381]  But suddenly a policeman looks and sees that I've got a sign under my arm.
[02:08:29.082 --> 02:08:30.942]  And says to me, what is that sign?
[02:08:30.982 --> 02:08:32.383]  You know, what have you got on your arm there?
[02:08:33.217 --> 02:08:35.698]  And I said to him, uh, well, don't you worry about it.
[02:08:35.738 --> 02:08:37.059]  It's not really any of your business.
[02:08:37.219 --> 02:08:43.141]  Yeah, in the birthplace of supposed modern liberty, the Magna Carta 1215, it's now been turned into Russia.
[02:08:43.161 --> 02:08:44.362]  That's, yeah.
[02:08:44.762 --> 02:08:50.084]  I mean, there's a, a misuse of legislation here is, um, is happening all the time.
[02:08:50.944 --> 02:08:54.926]  Well, you call it the misuse, uh, you know, that's like calling vaccines contaminated.
[02:08:55.506 --> 02:08:57.007]  Contaminated means it was an accident.
[02:08:57.227 --> 02:08:58.147]  It's not the misuse.
[02:08:58.708 --> 02:09:00.649]  No, yeah, I mean, well, yeah, I agree.
[02:09:00.729 --> 02:09:01.389]  I mean, there is, uh,
[02:09:02.099 --> 02:09:16.613]  We have the Serious Organized Crime Prevention Act, known as SOCPR, and that has been brought in the last two years, which basically designates a mile around Parliament as a press-free zone.
[02:09:16.873 --> 02:09:18.054]  There's also a bunch of other zones.
[02:09:18.354 --> 02:09:21.297]  Tell folks, though, about what the officer said.
[02:09:21.497 --> 02:09:22.198]  Tell the rest of the story.
[02:09:22.791 --> 02:09:32.194]  Well, basically, the officer said, you know, he took one look at the sign, it said something like Investigate 9-11 on it, and he totally flipped out and said to me, no, you can't do that, you can't do that.
[02:09:32.855 --> 02:09:41.318]  So he's wrestled me out of there, quite physical, and I've said to him, what section of the law gives you the right to do this?
[02:09:42.158 --> 02:09:44.339]  And he couldn't find one.
[02:09:45.939 --> 02:09:48.080]  But see, they're encouraged to do that now, so they do it.
[02:09:48.743 --> 02:10:00.429]  Yeah, they encouraged it, and so we got wrestled all the way to the side of Leicester Square, it's me and two friends of mine, and then the, you know, they're all debating how they can actually legally remove us.
[02:10:00.989 --> 02:10:13.196]  So eventually they serve us with what's called an anti-social dispersal order, or an ASDO, and effectively they banned us from central London for 24 hours, and told us that if we were seen again as a group,
[02:10:13.809 --> 02:10:14.730]  That we would all be arrested.
[02:10:14.970 --> 02:10:40.073]  Now let's be clear, that's to stop rioting drunk teenagers, burning cars, literally the cops, I talked to Paul and Steve, they say they let them do it and leave them alone, and then it's used on World War II top fighter aces who complain to police, so that's not allowed, and then the top, he's like one of the top, the highest veterans over there, he had like the highest, it was a Congressional Medal of Honor, so he was so disgraced he hung himself.
[02:10:40.726 --> 02:10:40.946]  Yeah.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:54.261]  Yeah, let's get into Peter Powers.
[02:10:54.281 --> 02:10:55.341]  Let's play that clip first.
[02:10:55.641 --> 02:11:02.063]  Then I want to get a comment from Philly911Truth, Nick Karangi, on this and then about some of the other things you've gone through.
[02:11:02.083 --> 02:11:03.443]  I'm going to shift gears into Ron Paul.
[02:11:03.883 --> 02:11:09.325]  All Ron Paul and economy coming up and some key statements about where I think this should move forward in the movement, in my own opinion.
[02:11:10.025 --> 02:11:15.066]  But let's go ahead and play the Peter Power clip from last week, John.
[02:11:15.086 --> 02:11:15.527]  Do you have that?
[02:11:16.667 --> 02:11:16.987]  Here it is.
[02:11:18.123 --> 02:11:28.265]  Because at half-past nine this morning, we were actually running an exercise for a company of a thousand people in London, based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations that happened this morning.
[02:11:28.685 --> 02:11:30.966]  So I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing upright.
[02:11:31.166 --> 02:11:37.567]  To get this quite straight, you were running an exercise to see how you would cope with this, and it happened while you were running the exercise?
[02:11:37.868 --> 02:11:38.348]  Precisely.
[02:11:38.548 --> 02:11:40.448]  And it was about half-past nine this morning.
[02:11:40.488 --> 02:11:44.029]  We planned this for a company, and for obvious reasons I don't want to reveal their name, but if they're listening they'll know it.
[02:11:45.269 --> 02:11:50.911]  The only thing I have, we're a little bit under budget.
[02:11:51.091 --> 02:11:54.593]  We're provided by the Arts Council.
[02:11:54.613 --> 02:11:56.654]  It's a very low budget.
[02:11:56.674 --> 02:11:58.074]  We don't get paid for this at all.
[02:11:58.714 --> 02:12:01.396]  We get sent out on these missions to interview celebrities.
[02:12:01.476 --> 02:12:04.077]  One thing I won't tolerate is you filming me now, aren't you?
[02:12:07.298 --> 02:12:15.522]  We'd like to know who are running mock terror drills for 7-7.
[02:12:15.562 --> 02:12:16.923]  Which company were you working for?
[02:12:17.463 --> 02:12:21.025]  You say there's a precise station, precise times at the precise three stations.
[02:12:21.065 --> 02:12:22.006]  Have you any comment on that?
[02:12:22.406 --> 02:12:24.747]  Why have you not been investigated or the company investigated?
[02:12:24.767 --> 02:12:26.348]  Why have you not investigated Mr Power?
[02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:30.051]  Fifty-two people died in those bombings, Mr. Power.
[02:12:30.211 --> 02:12:35.355]  Fifty-two people died in those power... Your duty to a federal case of burglary has done nothing.
[02:12:35.835 --> 02:12:37.916]  Fifty-two people died, Mr. Power.
[02:12:37.957 --> 02:12:39.818]  How do you know which three stations?
[02:12:39.858 --> 02:12:41.519]  Who helped you choose those three stations?
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:44.001]  How many people knew before the attack?
[02:12:44.061 --> 02:12:45.502]  How many people knew, Mr. Power?
[02:12:45.943 --> 02:12:47.364]  I'm sorry, I've got to go in here now.
[02:12:48.525 --> 02:12:49.405]  Would you choose ones?
[02:12:49.805 --> 02:12:52.508]  How many of your clients knew that those were simulated targets?
[02:12:54.205 --> 02:13:01.188]  Now, Simon Moir, one of the gentlemen doing that, he ran and hid, basically, in a small room until you guys were forced to leave.
[02:13:01.228 --> 02:13:02.608]  First, somebody's telling you you can't film.
[02:13:03.269 --> 02:13:10.051]  That's describing the video that you can't see, Lester, but it's up on PrisonPlanet.com as well as WeAreChangeUK.
[02:13:10.752 --> 02:13:11.872]  Just Google that and you'll find them.
[02:13:12.372 --> 02:13:13.453]  We'll give their site out in a minute.
[02:13:13.533 --> 02:13:17.594]  I mean, describe, though, because obviously video can't catch it all, what happened there in a nutshell.
[02:13:18.294 --> 02:13:21.996]  Well, basically, we sort of went in to kind of
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:38.953]  Do a bit of a recon on the conference and we were approached by a member of the event staff who asked us what we were up to and we said that we'd like to do an interview with Mr. Power and kind of write down on a piece of paper a few things that we wanted to talk to him about.
[02:13:40.094 --> 02:13:49.302]  To our astonishment about five minutes later Peter Power came out to talk to us and my friend Rob was filming with his camera
[02:13:49.798 --> 02:13:58.165]  He didn't like that very much, as you can hear, but what Mr. Power didn't see was Andy, our change member, who was actually at the back.
[02:13:58.445 --> 02:14:02.068]  Yeah, double cameras, double or triple cameras is always the way to go.
[02:14:02.809 --> 02:14:15.699]  He was totally unaware of this, and so when he began to walk away, Andy took the initiative and went straight up to him and began to film him up front, asking him very pertinent questions about his role in 7-7.
[02:14:17.478 --> 02:14:18.782]  Now let's be clear here.
[02:14:18.822 --> 02:14:20.205]  They're trying to intimidate speech.
[02:14:20.245 --> 02:14:21.989]  They're trying to say no demonstrations allowed.
[02:14:22.330 --> 02:14:23.353]  No free speech allowed.
[02:14:23.714 --> 02:14:25.759]  They're losing court cases in the UK and here.
[02:14:25.819 --> 02:14:26.160]  People are...
[02:14:26.901 --> 02:14:31.484]  Virally, supernova, taking action everywhere, that's why they're scared.
[02:14:31.944 --> 02:14:41.529]  If we give in to the terror watch list, if we give in to the intimidation, if we give in to the chilling effect, they then win and can go on to the next phase, literally.
[02:14:41.949 --> 02:14:48.593]  We are trying to save Western civilization from the depths of tyranny right now, and this all dovetails together perfectly.
[02:14:48.913 --> 02:14:56.077]  Nick Karangi, getting a Secret Service visit, for politely making some points to Bill Clinton, comments on what you just heard.
[02:14:58.939 --> 02:15:06.723]  Once again, this just shows the fear within this power structure to even acknowledge what they've done.
[02:15:06.963 --> 02:15:20.831]  But moreover, I think it shows that the power of We Are Change and groups of the like are able to, I guess, repel this advancing evil in that regard.
[02:15:20.931 --> 02:15:25.033]  But I wanted to make the point that we are hitting the barbed wire, as you say, right now.
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:36.166]  Um, for everybody else, and the things that have happened as a result of us getting Secret Service visitors, you know, put under these terror designations, um, we really need the support from the people out there.
[02:15:36.206 --> 02:15:37.647]  You have to get right behind us.
[02:15:37.687 --> 02:15:49.774]  Well, see, that's why I'm going to make some statements about the Ron Paul campaign coming up in the next segment, because listeners keep demanding this of me, so I'll just tell you flat out what I think about it, uh, because here we are hitting the barbed wire, and it's almost like we're bad.
[02:15:50.274 --> 02:15:54.598]  It's almost like, oh, you know, let's water down our message.
[02:15:54.658 --> 02:15:55.658]  No, it's the opposite.
[02:15:56.059 --> 02:15:56.999]  This is life and death.
[02:15:57.019 --> 02:15:58.561]  We're putting our lives on the line.
[02:15:59.021 --> 02:16:02.403]  Our futures, like the Secret Service told you, oh, you might not do too good with college.
[02:16:02.424 --> 02:16:03.284]  You might get in some trouble.
[02:16:03.684 --> 02:16:05.626]  I mean, we are here doing this.
[02:16:06.106 --> 02:16:10.830]  We know it's an inside job, and anybody who knows it's an inside job can't hold their tongue about that.
[02:16:11.505 --> 02:16:16.707]  You know, it's one thing if you want to say it's not an inside job, but then you agree with other libertarian principles, or freedom principles.
[02:16:16.727 --> 02:16:20.769]  But it's another thing to say, yeah, I know it's an inside job, but I choose not to discuss it or push it.
[02:16:20.929 --> 02:16:23.491]  They murdered 2,800 and something people.
[02:16:23.651 --> 02:16:24.671]  They're going to do it again.
[02:16:24.831 --> 02:16:27.733]  They're going to have a total martial law after the next attack.
[02:16:27.753 --> 02:16:30.354]  And then you can forget about all the Ron Paul stuff at that point.
[02:16:30.874 --> 02:16:32.095]  Again, I'm going to explain this later.
[02:16:32.175 --> 02:16:34.556]  Gentlemen, both of you, give out your numbers.
[02:16:34.636 --> 02:16:37.357]  Both of you, give out your contact websites repeatedly.
[02:16:37.837 --> 02:16:39.078]  Go ahead, Nick, you first.
[02:16:40.171 --> 02:16:49.262]  Yeah, our homepage is philly911truth.org and you can contact me through nick at philly911truth.org is the email.
[02:16:50.244 --> 02:16:55.190]  And we also have a new site up, it's nwoblogger and a lot of this information will be on there.
[02:16:55.817 --> 02:17:01.122]  Um, you know, as I went out today, it wasn't necessarily as Philly 9-11 Truth for that Bill Clinton confrontation.
[02:17:01.162 --> 02:17:02.583]  It was just as, you know, a concern.
[02:17:02.843 --> 02:17:06.446]  So let's go now, but you are the founder of Philly 9-11 Truth.
[02:17:06.486 --> 02:17:09.469]  Let's now go back to Simon Moore.
[02:17:09.809 --> 02:17:10.870]  Simon, you're in London.
[02:17:11.130 --> 02:17:12.892]  Give us the websites for people to join you.
[02:17:12.912 --> 02:17:13.893]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:17:13.973 --> 02:17:16.375]  Our website is wearechange.org.uk.
[02:17:16.395 --> 02:17:17.836]  That's O-R-G dot U-K.
[02:17:20.290 --> 02:17:27.817]  We do a weekly radio show on London radio station 104.4 which goes out on Sundays 6 to 7 p.m.
[02:17:27.857 --> 02:17:28.438]  local time.
[02:17:28.778 --> 02:17:30.980]  But you can also download that on the website.
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:31.881]  All right.
[02:17:32.041 --> 02:17:33.502]  Gentlemen, I salute you both.
[02:17:33.883 --> 02:17:35.825]  Continue operating in defense of humanity.
[02:17:36.145 --> 02:17:36.806]  I salute you.
[02:17:36.846 --> 02:17:37.486]  Go with God.
[02:17:37.506 --> 02:17:38.467]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:17:38.707 --> 02:17:38.928]  Thanks.
[02:17:46.501 --> 02:17:48.882]  Ted Anders from Midas, December 14, 2007.
[02:17:49.322 --> 02:17:56.245]  Gold 789.91 ounce gold coins to be purchased for 813.86, 401.15 for half, 258 for quarter.
[02:17:56.745 --> 02:17:59.206]  That's 813.86, 401.15, and 258.
[02:17:59.366 --> 02:18:03.568]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[02:18:03.848 --> 02:18:08.069]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[02:18:08.449 --> 02:18:12.391]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[02:18:12.691 --> 02:18:14.533]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[02:18:14.913 --> 02:18:16.635]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[02:18:16.875 --> 02:18:22.881]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[02:18:23.301 --> 02:18:30.088]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[02:18:30.428 --> 02:18:31.309]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:32.230]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:37.636 --> 02:18:40.762]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[02:18:40.862 --> 02:18:41.183]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:41.243 --> 02:18:42.646]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[02:18:46.189 --> 02:18:49.530]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:56.773]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:18:57.153 --> 02:19:09.638]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[02:19:09.878 --> 02:19:12.519]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[02:19:12.859 --> 02:19:19.042]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[02:19:19.282 --> 02:19:24.424]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[02:19:24.684 --> 02:19:32.928]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[02:19:33.148 --> 02:19:33.788]  And the best part?
[02:19:34.008 --> 02:19:36.009]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.

[02:22:30.658 --> 02:22:36.944]  In this segment, a little bit in the next, I'm going to get into where I think the Ron Paul campaign is going, the good things, the few bad things.
[02:22:37.645 --> 02:22:41.688]  We need to openly have discussions about all this, so we don't ever turn into a cult.
[02:22:45.606 --> 02:22:46.626]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[02:22:46.706 --> 02:22:49.107]  Bob, Stan, John, Ivan, Jason, many others.
[02:22:49.508 --> 02:22:51.208]  Total free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:51.228 --> 02:22:58.271]  Okay, Ron Paul, as you know, raised about six and a half million dollars in one day.
[02:22:58.291 --> 02:23:00.492]  Another half a million came in since then.
[02:23:00.932 --> 02:23:12.977]  They're clearly only about a million dollars or a little bit less away right now from winning, getting enough money to really
[02:23:14.540 --> 02:23:15.220]  We're good to go.
[02:23:35.279 --> 02:23:43.827]  Become poll watchers, get involved in different vote rescue and black box voting groups that are out there engaging the New World Order across the United States.
[02:23:44.408 --> 02:23:46.170]  So it's another big issue we've got to discuss.
[02:23:47.051 --> 02:23:48.952]  And that brings me into Orthodox people.
[02:23:50.414 --> 02:23:58.562]  You've got a lot of mainline Republicans, and that's good, that have joined the Ron Paul revolution, but it seems that from their mighty perches,
[02:24:00.052 --> 02:24:05.876]  That they are supposed to dictate to us that you're not even supposed to talk about election fraud.
[02:24:07.276 --> 02:24:09.277]  No, no, that sounds like we're sore losers.
[02:24:10.118 --> 02:24:15.881]  Or we're not even supposed to talk about the government staging provocations or events.
[02:24:16.542 --> 02:24:22.845]  But Ron Paul, about ten times in the last year and a half on this show, has talked about it every time, about how they can stage a provocation.
[02:24:25.046 --> 02:24:26.467]  He brings that up without prompting.
[02:24:27.603 --> 02:24:28.943]  That's a nod to 9-11 truth.
[02:24:28.963 --> 02:24:30.004]  He's just not going all the way.
[02:24:30.404 --> 02:24:36.985]  He said he wants to do an investigation and ask questions and doesn't trust exactly what happened, but then he kind of on the other end plays politics and he does some of that.
[02:24:37.005 --> 02:24:39.586]  He's still, you know, running for president.
[02:24:40.326 --> 02:24:44.627]  Anybody who saw Ron Paul on The View last week, just go find it and watch it for yourself, folks.
[02:24:46.688 --> 02:24:49.648]  He's being pretty slippery there on the abortion issue, saying it's up to the states.
[02:24:49.668 --> 02:24:52.169]  Of course, the states would then ban it, and he's for that.
[02:24:53.142 --> 02:24:57.727]  But, you know, on that point especially, I just can't compromise.
[02:24:57.967 --> 02:24:58.968]  I just can't do it.
[02:24:58.988 --> 02:25:03.412]  I'm against abortion, and I'm for a ban of it at the states.
[02:25:03.472 --> 02:25:09.297]  And, you know, the feds have laws against capital murder, so the feds have jurisdiction over murder as well.
[02:25:09.497 --> 02:25:11.719]  So I differ there.
[02:25:11.759 --> 02:25:13.561]  I differ on net neutrality.
[02:25:13.581 --> 02:25:16.344]  I differ on just a few issues.
[02:25:17.453 --> 02:25:21.414]  And I don't think we need to get sidetracked and angry at Ron Paul about that.
[02:25:21.434 --> 02:25:27.015]  You know, I'm only addressing something here that people keep calling in about, keep bringing up, that people are upset about.
[02:25:28.075 --> 02:25:33.837]  And I really think that you need to look at the bigger picture.
[02:25:33.917 --> 02:25:41.238]  Now, with that said, the bigger picture of what Ron Paul's doing, but still questioning, that's always important.
[02:25:42.278 --> 02:25:44.419]  But there's others in the Ron Paul camp
[02:25:45.177 --> 02:25:47.278]  Who are trying to take us even in the opposite direction.
[02:25:48.378 --> 02:25:56.142]  And, you know, evidence of this, Daniel Esselstyn has predicted a lot of things as good sources, impeccable, in the past on my show, and in video interviews.
[02:25:56.242 --> 02:26:04.926]  I mean, I wish he wasn't right, but, you know, he said that there's open discussions of what would happen if the establishment assassinated Ron Paul, that the establishment is discussing that.
[02:26:05.586 --> 02:26:12.129]  And I got emails and saw my story pulled off some big Ron Paul supporter sites saying, oh, that's a conspiracy theory, we shouldn't discuss it.
[02:26:12.149 --> 02:26:31.899]  It didn't matter that my article had Ron Paul's audio from a few months ago, what, three or four months ago, and the text of him saying, oh, yeah, he knows they kill people and have killed a lot of, you know, leaders and people challenging the system from what Martin Luther King to the Kingfish Huey Long to, he went on and on.
[02:26:33.343 --> 02:26:38.324]  So see, now you've got people saying, we're not even supposed to talk about what Ron Paul talks about.
[02:26:39.204 --> 02:26:54.126]  And the minute you do that, see there's such a background noise of propaganda and media and a thousand channels, times a thousand, that you've got to come out with the bold truth to even break through people's cognitive dissonance and their defenses.
[02:26:55.127 --> 02:27:02.948]  And so I've ignored this and tried not to bring it up for a while, except when callers call in, I've got to tell you my true assessment of it.
[02:27:03.756 --> 02:27:08.860]  And we just need to continue to do what we think is right individually.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:10.361]  Okay?
[02:27:10.781 --> 02:27:13.763]  You have a right to know 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:27:14.343 --> 02:27:18.546]  You have a right to know Ron Paul has talked about assassination being a threat and a danger.
[02:27:19.487 --> 02:27:25.391]  You have a right to say there's a new world order.
[02:27:26.792 --> 02:27:28.193]  To say there's a North American Union.
[02:27:28.253 --> 02:27:28.773]  Because there is.
[02:27:30.146 --> 02:27:34.612]  And I'm going to finish up with this when we get back, and I'm going to give you some economic news in your calls.
[02:27:36.355 --> 02:27:39.359]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:43.003]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.164 --> 02:27:51.828]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:27:52.008 --> 02:27:57.152]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:27:57.432 --> 02:28:02.516]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:28:02.816 --> 02:28:06.379]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[02:28:06.599 --> 02:28:06.999]  I'm good to go!
[02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:36.055]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[02:28:36.415 --> 02:28:42.607]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now, by going directly to alkavision.com.
[02:28:42.887 --> 02:28:44.310]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[02:28:45.592 --> 02:28:49.054]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:28:49.274 --> 02:28:51.395]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:28:51.535 --> 02:28:53.996]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[02:28:54.256 --> 02:28:58.619]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[02:28:58.659 --> 02:28:59.339]  Here's why.
[02:28:59.739 --> 02:29:05.682]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:29:05.902 --> 02:29:13.046]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not cheating.
[02:29:13.306 --> 02:29:14.087]  We're good to go.
[02:29:44.147 --> 02:29:48.732]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:29:48.912 --> 02:29:54.097]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:29:54.438 --> 02:29:59.743]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:00.144 --> 02:30:01.225]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:01.605 --> 02:30:10.672]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:30:10.932 --> 02:30:12.533]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[02:30:55.881 --> 02:30:57.583]  Let me put it to you real simple.
[02:30:58.343 --> 02:31:00.745]  I'm proud of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:31:01.546 --> 02:31:05.769]  I'm proud of the Anti-Government Sponsored Terror Movement.
[02:31:07.131 --> 02:31:10.513]  I am proud of all of you out there.
[02:31:11.434 --> 02:31:15.858]  And so whereas I'm not attacking people in the Ron Paul Movement who are mainline Republicans,
[02:31:16.798 --> 02:31:22.702]  Uh, for a lot of their uneducated, silly, uninformed, uh, you know, milquetoast, pap-level stuff.
[02:31:22.843 --> 02:31:23.723]  I mean, they're beginners.
[02:31:24.624 --> 02:31:28.567]  But I'm not going to sit here and tell you, because I know you're getting mad about it.
[02:31:28.587 --> 02:31:30.168]  I've been getting lots of emails the last few weeks.
[02:31:31.469 --> 02:31:33.170]  Uh, and it's kind of, it's intensifying.
[02:31:33.791 --> 02:31:41.356]  I mean, we can't allow ourselves to feel like we're bad and just shut up about the incredible service we've been providing and the incredible danger we've been in.
[02:31:42.117 --> 02:31:43.478]  Plus, you go to Ron Paul events.
[02:31:43.518 --> 02:31:45.199]  Ted Anderson is a Republican delegate.
[02:31:45.993 --> 02:31:47.093]  He's in the Republican Party.
[02:31:48.574 --> 02:31:51.375]  He's been a Ron Paul supporter ever since I knew him 12 years ago.
[02:31:51.395 --> 02:31:53.215]  I guess I met Ted 11 years ago.
[02:31:53.235 --> 02:31:57.817]  You know, you always hear him plugging Ron Paul and putting out Ron Paul reports and the rest of it.
[02:31:58.497 --> 02:32:03.638]  And he goes to Republican meetings, not just Ron Paul meetings, but he goes to these big Republican $500, $300 a plate dinners.
[02:32:04.258 --> 02:32:07.639]  And he says, A, pretty much all of them are Ron Paul supporters.
[02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:12.601]  And then most of them are listeners of this show and found out about Ron Paul through the network and through my show.
[02:32:13.385 --> 02:32:14.365]  Bob Paul said that on air.
[02:32:14.405 --> 02:32:15.906]  Half the people that come up to him are from the show.
[02:32:17.166 --> 02:32:28.648]  And then snot-nosed, you know, Johnny Come Lately, mainline Republicans join and they say, hey, we need to stop talking about the North American Union.
[02:32:28.688 --> 02:32:29.328]  I've heard them do that.
[02:32:30.088 --> 02:32:32.969]  You know, okay, it's real, but that's kind of kooky still.
[02:32:34.609 --> 02:32:36.230]  And then, you know, let's not talk about 9-11.
[02:32:36.350 --> 02:32:37.770]  Let's shut up about that.
[02:32:38.627 --> 02:32:44.968]  And let's not talk about, and then see, fine, you don't have to talk about that, but don't tell us what to talk about.
[02:32:45.488 --> 02:32:47.669]  And another thing is, these groups will all take our support.
[02:32:48.809 --> 02:32:55.050]  You know, the biggest supporters, money-wise, are the Patriot Movement.
[02:32:55.991 --> 02:33:04.472]  And that's why Ron Paul comes on this show, that's why he, despite national attacks on Fox News and CNN, they can front him on these shows about me, he still comes here.
[02:33:04.833 --> 02:33:06.893]  He's loyal and knows where his base is, and he's a good guy.
[02:33:08.777 --> 02:33:13.039]  And every time he comes on there, he says he's worried about the government staging a provocation, staging an attack.
[02:33:13.399 --> 02:33:13.999]  He said that.
[02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:16.200]  He's talked about Tonkin.
[02:33:16.721 --> 02:33:18.662]  He's talked about Mozadek in 53.
[02:33:19.022 --> 02:33:22.363]  So, so... I'm not going to say any more than that, okay?
[02:33:23.284 --> 02:33:26.865]  I know a lot of things that aren't for public consumption because of the behind-the-scenes things.
[02:33:27.486 --> 02:33:32.828]  It's just, um... 9-11 Truth is good and of the best people in this country.
[02:33:33.989 --> 02:33:36.950]  And, uh... So we need to just not...
[02:33:37.875 --> 02:33:46.117]  9-11 Truth doesn't need to squabble and get mad at Ron Paul because, you know, he's playing the part of, well, they attack us over here because we're over there.
[02:33:46.397 --> 02:33:48.358]  Kind of the reverse of what the establishment says.
[02:33:49.878 --> 02:33:53.019]  And going along with the, you know, CIA assessment and spam.
[02:33:53.619 --> 02:33:54.640]  Fine and dandy, folks.
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:56.340]  I mean, okay, let's just say that's what he believes.
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:56.900]  That's just right.
[02:33:57.460 --> 02:34:03.342]  But what I won't stand for is people who know 9-11 is an inside job who then say, well, we shouldn't talk about it.
[02:34:04.809 --> 02:34:05.930]  You have to talk about 9-11.
[02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:08.592]  And I really dwelt on this.
[02:34:09.053 --> 02:34:23.606]  If you know 9-11, that is, I've been thinking about it a lot, if you know it's an inside job, or you know there's evidence that they're lying about what really happened, everybody admits that, 84% of Americans believe that, then you have to talk about it.
[02:34:23.946 --> 02:34:26.609]  Do you understand government-sponsored terror is the key?
[02:34:27.489 --> 02:34:33.152]  If they do a couple more, even one more big one, folks, it's going to go to a very serious point.
[02:34:33.192 --> 02:34:34.513]  This is the calm before the storm.
[02:34:35.033 --> 02:34:39.996]  This is all fun and dandy and wave our signs and talk about freedom and all this other stuff.
[02:34:40.636 --> 02:34:42.137]  But there's a much more serious side.
[02:34:42.538 --> 02:34:52.223]  They're releasing all these chemical and biological systems and all these genetically engineered cross-species organisms to cause crises and they'll offer a bigger solution.
[02:34:53.826 --> 02:35:00.992]  They're engineering super flus, everything else, and I'm thinking about some super plague coming through and my children dying.
[02:35:01.032 --> 02:35:03.313]  I'm thinking about serious stuff.
[02:35:05.535 --> 02:35:07.817]  And I'll say more about that.
[02:35:08.017 --> 02:35:15.223]  We as a patriot movement, we don't want to go to the extreme of the ninnying Cointelpro mockingbirds.
[02:35:15.543 --> 02:35:17.344]  Most of them aren't actually Cointelpro.
[02:35:17.564 --> 02:35:20.907]  They repeat and regurgitate what a few mockingbirds put out.
[02:35:22.327 --> 02:35:27.789]  You know, about is this guy a reptoid, a Scientologist, a Vatican assassin, a Zionist, whatever.
[02:35:27.809 --> 02:35:28.709]  You know, they do it to everybody.
[02:35:29.029 --> 02:35:33.411]  And then we spend about half our energy doing that instead of taking action.
[02:35:33.431 --> 02:35:45.995]  But at the same time, we have to know that just because the mainstream media lies, and just because the mainstream media spins, and just because they engage in things, doesn't mean everybody who's in the alternative media is good either.
[02:35:48.542 --> 02:35:49.442]  I mean, I'll just say it.
[02:35:49.882 --> 02:35:57.445]  I will not take sponsors that claim they have magic beams you pay $4,000 for, and it heals you of anything that ails you.
[02:35:58.745 --> 02:35:59.405]  I won't be part of it.
[02:36:01.446 --> 02:36:03.927]  I also... I just want to get the stuff off my chest.
[02:36:04.507 --> 02:36:15.850]  I also will not be part of... If I find out there's some kind of debt elimination thing, and I go research it, and then later I find out it's not good, I won't promote it.
[02:36:18.152 --> 02:36:20.902]  I mean, I attempt to be moral.
[02:36:21.946 --> 02:36:23.993]  And a lot of times, revolutionaries are the most immoral.
[02:36:24.713 --> 02:36:28.636]  You know, they claim they have this big cause, but they say, well, because of the cause, we'll do immoral things.
[02:36:29.017 --> 02:36:32.059]  Because we've got to have money to operate, we'll do things that are bad.
[02:36:32.439 --> 02:36:33.100]  I won't do that.
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:38.884]  In fact, I've been so focused today that I'm not even plugging my sponsors that are good sponsors, and I'm not even plugging my videos.
[02:36:39.385 --> 02:36:40.226]  Have you noticed that today?
[02:36:40.246 --> 02:36:45.470]  I mean, I'm getting to the point, and I'm not just saying this, I almost think I ought to just go off the radio.
[02:36:45.570 --> 02:36:54.177]  I'm strongly considering it, just to show everyone how serious I am about how much, because it's almost like even talk, this stuff's so bad, that
[02:36:55.402 --> 02:36:56.723]  That I want to get people's attention.
[02:36:56.763 --> 02:37:06.670]  I mean, I want to get people... I mean, it's almost like it's so bad that if I'm not totally hardcore and totally pure and totally focused, that it doesn't even do justice to it.
[02:37:06.711 --> 02:37:11.694]  This information is so holy that I don't even feel adequate to do it.
[02:37:14.216 --> 02:37:16.838]  I mean, I'm one inch away from moving to Montana or Wyoming.
[02:37:16.898 --> 02:37:18.239]  I'm one inch.
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.922]  But then I know... I mean, because of
[02:37:23.044 --> 02:37:31.028]  The fact that when people ask, there'll just be big messages up on the website, you know, just saying that this is a symbol of how serious everything is.
[02:37:32.928 --> 02:37:33.789]  But that's just a thought.
[02:37:35.189 --> 02:37:52.277]  The point is, I've just been really thinking a lot lately, and people within the movement at higher levels are jealous of me, they hate me, they're always trying to suck off of me, and I'd like to just go away
[02:37:53.456 --> 02:37:56.899]  And just show everybody how everything dissipates by about 50%.
[02:37:56.959 --> 02:37:59.180]  See, I don't feel appreciated.
[02:37:59.501 --> 02:38:02.183]  And it's not that I want to be appreciated and have you appreciate me.
[02:38:02.463 --> 02:38:11.369]  I want you to get your heads out of your... out of the ground and focus on the fact that we are in serious trouble.
[02:38:14.652 --> 02:38:21.657]  And that... And then if I came back, maybe then, other networks I'm affiliated with, you name it,
[02:38:22.603 --> 02:38:29.288]  Other hosts who are involved in every form of quackery and an embarrassing bull.
[02:38:30.376 --> 02:38:44.222]  You know, I mean, here I am trying to be this upright, moral person, and do the right thing always, and not screw people, and pay people what they're owed, and be a good person, and I just see a sea of people that think that it's okay to run over whoever you want, do whatever, and again, it's not just the Patriot Movement.
[02:38:44.262 --> 02:38:45.402]  We're better than the mainstream.
[02:38:45.803 --> 02:38:48.744]  The whole society, everybody I know says they're being cheated in business.
[02:38:49.144 --> 02:38:52.125]  Everybody I know says that there's scams everywhere.
[02:38:52.446 --> 02:38:57.908]  Everybody I know says everything's getting more and more immoral, more and more cheating on husbands and wives, more and more
[02:38:58.708 --> 02:39:01.550]  Uh, just, just, just everything is unraveling, folks.
[02:39:02.470 --> 02:39:03.311]  I look at people.
[02:39:03.351 --> 02:39:07.793]  They look more and more like retarded slobs at the shopping mall or at the supermarket.
[02:39:08.193 --> 02:39:09.514]  I'm talking about the yuppies, too.
[02:39:09.814 --> 02:39:14.976]  Or they're these crazed, aggressive, hyper-dominant people running around trying to eat everybody's lunch.
[02:39:23.341 --> 02:39:24.661]  Alright, I said I'd take your calls.
[02:39:24.841 --> 02:39:25.642]  It's just, um...
[02:39:26.707 --> 02:39:31.809]  You know, I've just gotten to a point in my life where I know that I know more than 99% of people.
[02:39:32.529 --> 02:39:33.990]  And again, I don't know that much.
[02:39:34.030 --> 02:39:34.910]  That's what freaks me out.
[02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:40.352]  And I know I've done my research, and I know I understand what they're doing, and I know I understand their system.
[02:39:41.993 --> 02:39:47.555]  And I know that there are White House talking points about how I'm Tim McVeigh and Charlie Manson and how I need to be arrested.
[02:39:48.135 --> 02:39:51.837]  And I know, folks, that my shelf life is not very long.
[02:39:52.877 --> 02:39:54.698]  And so I'll be... I'm not going to say it.
[02:39:55.353 --> 02:39:58.794]  I'll be you-know-what-ed if I am going... I've got to control myself.
[02:40:00.414 --> 02:40:02.335]  Never used profanity I did on TV last week.
[02:40:05.435 --> 02:40:10.537]  If I have to sit here and wallow with a bunch of slime, I will not do it.
[02:40:12.277 --> 02:40:14.157]  I at least don't need to have it around me in my show.
[02:40:16.398 --> 02:40:20.659]  I mean, the people I have supported, the people I have done everything for,
[02:40:21.474 --> 02:40:27.376]  The people that I have built up turn around and stab me in the back with wanton, lustful abandon.
[02:40:28.697 --> 02:40:32.678]  And then they're surprised when I don't promote their shows anymore or when I don't talk about them anymore.
[02:40:34.799 --> 02:40:35.859]  And it just makes me sick.
[02:40:35.879 --> 02:40:36.879]  I don't even hate them anymore.
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:40.021]  It just makes me sick at what society's turned into.
[02:40:40.041 --> 02:40:43.502]  But I know you, the listeners, and I've met you, I've hugged you, I know you.
[02:40:43.762 --> 02:40:44.902]  You are the salt of the earth.
[02:40:44.922 --> 02:40:47.003]  You are the best thing out there in the world.
[02:40:47.803 --> 02:40:49.524]  You are the people that have to be the leaders.
[02:40:50.353 --> 02:40:54.296]  Most of the people that get involved in things like this at higher levels do it because they want power.
[02:40:55.056 --> 02:40:56.497]  And do it because they want prestige.
[02:40:56.537 --> 02:41:01.940]  And hell, probably half of me got involved with that at a subconscious level because I am a dominant, aggressive person.
[02:41:02.340 --> 02:41:07.223]  But let me tell you, I have drunk from it and I know it's something that gives you a stomachache.
[02:41:07.644 --> 02:41:08.484]  So I've grown up.
[02:41:08.724 --> 02:41:10.606]  I have gone on to another level.
[02:41:11.866 --> 02:41:14.428]  And I still shift back and forth into my old self.
[02:41:15.148 --> 02:41:16.049]  It's a daily struggle.
[02:41:17.495 --> 02:41:19.096]  But let me explain something to you.
[02:41:19.657 --> 02:41:22.659]  They're putting cancer viruses in all the major vaccines.
[02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:27.804]  Most of the food you eat has been genetically engineered and is killing you.
[02:41:29.965 --> 02:41:32.227]  Again, 1 in 33 had cancer.
[02:41:33.909 --> 02:41:35.130]  Now 1 in 3 has it.
[02:41:35.210 --> 02:41:37.732]  Official government numbers.
[02:41:37.752 --> 02:41:40.354]  1 in a couple hundred had diabetes.
[02:41:40.374 --> 02:41:41.515]  Now it's 1 in 3.
[02:41:41.855 --> 02:41:42.516]  Trending to be
[02:41:44.412 --> 02:41:45.793]  One and a half in the next few years.
[02:41:46.273 --> 02:41:47.993]  And then two out of three will have diabetes.
[02:41:48.313 --> 02:41:51.414]  We are under bio-weapon attack.
[02:41:53.455 --> 02:41:58.117]  We are under absolute end of days type hell.
[02:41:58.697 --> 02:42:01.698]  It's like slow motion, I am legend.
[02:42:03.718 --> 02:42:07.680]  But it isn't big and theatrical, a bunch of ghouls running around the streets.
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:08.660]  It's people dying.
[02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:09.640]  It's babies dying.
[02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:11.581]  It's serious stuff happening.
[02:42:15.569 --> 02:42:17.510]  And I just don't think people are serious enough.
[02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:21.873]  And I think people hear me get all fired up and all hardcore and they go, man, listen to that guy.
[02:42:22.334 --> 02:42:26.657]  Listen, when you're under attack, you get fired up.
[02:42:26.717 --> 02:42:27.597]  You get serious.
[02:42:32.701 --> 02:42:37.044]  I mean, my God, to risk my life and be nationally attacked and have White House hit pieces out on me.
[02:42:38.943 --> 02:42:49.048]  And then to see half our movement, a bunch of jealous fiends, trying to pull down what I'm doing, when I'm just praying to God every night, I can live a few months more, a few years more, so I can fight the New World Order.
[02:42:51.429 --> 02:43:08.517]  And when I have nostalgia for the way my life was before I got involved in this, and I think about all the things and places I'll never go and never get to do, or God forbid, I think about 20, 30 years in some jail cell with unhappy, soul-sucked demons having their way with me.
[02:43:10.783 --> 02:43:28.056]  So I'm telling you, the good men and women, the good people out there, the people that have the love of decency and honor, and who love to give, and who love to fight, and who love to have passion, my soulmates out there, I'm telling you, you need to move past Alex Jones.
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:36.204]  And you need to even move past supporting Ron Paul, but as he said, he's not your savior, he's just a focal point.
[02:43:36.545 --> 02:43:43.469]  You have to move in, as I've always told you, into you being leaders, you taking action, you getting involved, and affecting change.
[02:43:44.921 --> 02:43:47.022]  The good people need to take over the internet.
[02:43:47.042 --> 02:43:49.323]  The good people need to flood all the events.
[02:43:49.364 --> 02:43:51.565]  The good people need to set up their own organizations.
[02:43:52.145 --> 02:43:57.288]  They need to go out, and you need to follow your heart, and your intellect, and your soul, and what you know is the truth.
[02:43:57.588 --> 02:44:00.750]  And if you know 9-11 is an inside job, don't ever shut up about it!
[02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:04.452]  Because self-censorship is how this new world order rules.
[02:44:05.272 --> 02:44:06.253]  It's how they control.
[02:44:10.317 --> 02:44:12.298]  I said I'd take calls, and we've got a load of lines here.
[02:44:12.738 --> 02:44:13.698]  Let's quickly go to your calls.
[02:44:13.758 --> 02:44:15.039]  Bob in New York, you're on the air.
[02:44:15.639 --> 02:44:16.379]  Yeah, hi there, Alex.
[02:44:16.399 --> 02:44:31.165]  This is the first time I've called your program, and I would like to emphasize very strongly for people, especially in New York, since this is where I am, to call up the Neocon talk shows and really, you know, push Ron Paul, because Hennity actually censors the people on the air.
[02:44:31.225 --> 02:44:31.785]  In fact, last
[02:44:32.205 --> 02:44:34.126]  I think it was like last, early last week.
[02:44:34.506 --> 02:44:39.268]  You can tell when a person is about to talk about Ron Paul or else they'll mention their name.
[02:44:39.528 --> 02:44:44.510]  He'll cut them off and all of a sudden he'll do the wimpy little things that, oh I don't know what happened to that call.
[02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:46.171]  It must have got cut off somehow.
[02:44:46.711 --> 02:44:52.054]  You know, he's such a, he's like the Bart Simpson of talk radio, that kind of thing.
[02:44:52.094 --> 02:44:57.536]  Well what they are is paid prostitutes to pose as conservatives, just like a wolf can put on sheep's clothing.
[02:44:58.209 --> 02:44:58.989]  It's elementary.
[02:44:59.529 --> 02:45:01.450]  People can't admit they've been conned by him.
[02:45:01.470 --> 02:45:09.292]  I mean, for Neil Borch to say, fire anybody that supports Alex Jones, fire any 9-11 truthers, that's what the Nazis started doing.
[02:45:09.332 --> 02:45:10.332]  That's desperation.
[02:45:10.572 --> 02:45:12.613]  And then to say I'm Tim McVeigh?
[02:45:13.553 --> 02:45:18.035]  Yeah, I can't believe that Michael Reagan actually said that Hillary would be better than Ron Paul.
[02:45:18.095 --> 02:45:19.495]  Where is his mind at?
[02:45:20.737 --> 02:45:21.818]  Well, it's with his bosses.
[02:45:22.158 --> 02:45:25.822]  He knows it's even destroying a show, but they have to do it to keep power.
[02:45:26.322 --> 02:45:26.502]  Yeah.
[02:45:26.803 --> 02:45:31.407]  There's also another talk show host in New York that's getting a play.
[02:45:31.427 --> 02:45:33.229]  He's a neocon called Steve Malzberg.
[02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:38.774]  And he actually said, I actually heard him on the radio last week saying, this guy actually got through, talked about Ron Paul.
[02:45:39.074 --> 02:45:45.540]  He interrupted him and went, before he went to commercial, he said, well, listen, if Ron Paul ever becomes president, I'm going to leave the country.
[02:45:47.345 --> 02:45:51.126]  There isn't going to be a country, okay, if we don't stop the North American Union.
[02:45:51.166 --> 02:45:51.787]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:52.167 --> 02:45:52.487]  I know!
[02:45:52.547 --> 02:45:53.748]  They're showing their true colors!
[02:45:54.008 --> 02:46:06.433]  You know, I was on a big syndicated show out of North Carolina a couple weeks ago, a week ago, and for two hours, and this White House speechwriter calls in and says I'm a liar, they don't write speeches for Hillary, they're not advising her.
[02:46:06.754 --> 02:46:09.895]  I just Googled it and read three articles on air to them.
[02:46:09.995 --> 02:46:10.895]  See, look.
[02:46:13.032 --> 02:46:14.174]  Stan in Missouri.
[02:46:14.194 --> 02:46:14.894]  You're on the air, Stan.
[02:46:15.295 --> 02:46:16.016]  Hello, Alex.
[02:46:16.036 --> 02:46:16.076]  Hi.
[02:46:16.637 --> 02:46:24.226]  Do you know by the year 2009 you're going to be forced by the TV manufacturers and FCC to buy a high-definition TV?
[02:46:24.406 --> 02:46:24.666]  Yes.
[02:46:25.147 --> 02:46:26.749]  Or you will not be able to receive a signal.
[02:46:28.914 --> 02:46:29.254]  Okay.
[02:46:29.535 --> 02:46:29.775]  Yep.
[02:46:29.955 --> 02:46:32.977]  They're literally telling you now what television you have to own, Alex.
[02:46:33.397 --> 02:46:40.342]  Low-income people and some middle-class people do not have $900 in their budget to go out and buy themselves a high-definition TV.
[02:46:40.362 --> 02:46:43.705]  And that's just exactly what they want, a dumb, down-populous.
[02:46:44.686 --> 02:46:45.086]  I hear you.
[02:46:45.106 --> 02:46:47.948]  What do you think about the great Ron Paul revolution and the huge money bomb?
[02:46:49.209 --> 02:46:50.370]  I'm with Ron Paul.
[02:46:50.530 --> 02:46:54.573]  I think Ron Paul is doing just about all he can for his country.
[02:46:55.350 --> 02:47:00.233]  A friend of mine today, Alex, he received some literature from AARP.
[02:47:00.273 --> 02:47:06.937]  They're coming out now with whether or not anybody that doesn't vote in this country should it be a crime not to vote.
[02:47:07.717 --> 02:47:15.182]  They're considering, you know, taking this poll to see whether or not people... Yeah, they want to make all the idiots that don't know how to brush their teeth or wipe their noses go vote.
[02:47:16.543 --> 02:47:17.523]  Thanks for the call, Stan.
[02:47:17.543 --> 02:47:18.244]  Good to hear from you.
[02:47:18.584 --> 02:47:19.365]  John in Ohio.
[02:47:19.405 --> 02:47:20.105]  John, go ahead.
[02:47:21.146 --> 02:47:24.848]  Yes, I was really inspired to call you despite my
[02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:42.681]  Strong disagreements with about 30% in my total inspiration and being shamed by your bravery and courage on the 9-11 truth inside job issue and the police state that is galloping at us now at an increasing pace.
[02:47:43.601 --> 02:48:03.113]  But I think when you have these kinds of, just juvenile comparisons of what you're doing and exposing the only ones who benefit from 9-11, from inside job terrorism, false flag terrorism, are the very people that they support.
[02:48:03.533 --> 02:48:12.138]  The only ones who benefit from violence are those people that in this talk show networks who say that, who are like vampires,
[02:48:12.828 --> 02:48:13.348]  It's an oxymoron.
[02:48:13.368 --> 02:48:15.449]  Stay there, I'll give you a minute on the other side.
[02:48:15.469 --> 02:48:16.689]  Then Ivan and Jason.
[02:48:46.642 --> 02:48:48.043]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.063 --> 02:48:50.185]  A New World Order.
[02:48:50.885 --> 02:48:55.129]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:55.769 --> 02:48:57.530]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:48:57.730 --> 02:49:00.853]  Would their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.393 --> 02:49:03.855]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.575 --> 02:49:11.901]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.907 --> 02:49:19.890]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.370 --> 02:49:23.832]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.232 --> 02:49:26.753]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.793 --> 02:49:27.934]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.954 --> 02:49:28.674]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.694 --> 02:49:29.815]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.035 --> 02:49:30.815]  They're after power.
[02:49:31.016 --> 02:49:32.036]  They're after affluence.

[02:49:43.762 --> 02:49:44.963]  You have been warned.
[02:49:47.224 --> 02:49:48.284]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:48.604 --> 02:49:51.405]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.666 --> 02:49:55.807]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:56.227 --> 02:49:57.068]  So what do you do?
[02:49:57.388 --> 02:50:01.950]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:02.450 --> 02:50:04.571]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:05.051 --> 02:50:05.931]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:50:06.351 --> 02:50:19.754]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:50:45.851 --> 02:50:46.271]  Attention!
[02:50:46.391 --> 02:50:49.193]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:50:49.493 --> 02:50:53.795]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:50:54.115 --> 02:50:54.795]  Listen closely.
[02:50:55.455 --> 02:51:02.919]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[02:51:03.219 --> 02:51:11.963]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[02:51:12.583 --> 02:51:12.723]  Yeah.
[02:51:33.567 --> 02:51:37.132]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[02:51:37.373 --> 02:51:40.637]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:51:52.114 --> 02:51:54.695]  Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive.
[02:51:54.715 --> 02:51:59.136]  He stood six foot six, weighed 245, kind of broad at the shoulder.
[02:51:59.156 --> 02:52:01.716]  Alright, John, in Ohio, then we'll go to Ivan in Texas.
[02:52:01.756 --> 02:52:02.836]  Finish up what you were saying, my friend.
[02:52:03.477 --> 02:52:12.659]  Yes, I really think you should go on the offensive, and everybody should go on the offensive against these whores and these liars in the media that are even more responsible than Bush and Cheney pretty much.
[02:52:12.679 --> 02:52:18.560]  Well, I mean, John, can you imagine what it's like to literally turn the radio on and hear Sean Hannity attacking and not even listen to it once a month?
[02:52:18.960 --> 02:52:24.665]  To turn on Neil Bortz and hearing him say I'm Tim McVeigh and Charlie Manson and anybody who's associated with me should be fired?
[02:52:25.906 --> 02:52:44.441]  That's exactly why I never listen to him and this is what really caused me to make this urgent call because I think it's ridiculous on his face for them to accuse you of being a Timothy McVeigh when you expose the people that they support that were behind these terrorist attacks and that they only benefit from this.
[02:52:44.521 --> 02:52:45.342]  I think we ought to do what
[02:52:46.041 --> 02:52:48.322]  People like Ralph Shoneman did during the Vietnam War.
[02:52:48.362 --> 02:52:50.764]  They put an informal War Crimes Tribunal.
[02:52:50.804 --> 02:52:58.468]  They monitored and collated all of the lies, all of the implications of those who supported that war officially in the government.
[02:52:58.888 --> 02:53:07.692]  And they had prominent people accusing them of the war crimes and the treason and the violations of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[02:53:07.973 --> 02:53:09.193]  And I think this should be done.
[02:53:09.253 --> 02:53:10.534]  People should actually turn this
[02:53:11.174 --> 02:53:13.856]  I mean, literally, I'm non-violent.
[02:53:13.876 --> 02:53:15.077]  I preach non-violence.
[02:53:15.557 --> 02:53:24.464]  You know, I help little old ladies across the street, and visit my parents, and love my children, and help Meals on Wheels and Soup Kitchens, and they're calling me Tim McVeigh.
[02:53:24.784 --> 02:53:28.207]  And by the way, what do you think about it being a talking point, John?
[02:53:28.507 --> 02:53:29.408]  It's a talking point.
[02:53:29.948 --> 02:53:30.648]  Well, absolutely.
[02:53:31.549 --> 02:53:32.630]  They're nothing but shills.
[02:53:33.263 --> 02:53:35.626]  I think because you're so effective on that issue.
[02:53:35.646 --> 02:53:38.569]  I consider myself a socialist and I get a little frustrated with some of those
[02:53:50.572 --> 02:53:55.414]  On the left, who are afraid to drop out of their gatekeeper role on 9-11 Truth and the rest of it.
[02:53:55.474 --> 02:54:04.197]  And I really believe, because you've been so effective, and I think you ought to turn this around against them, and point out that they're the ones that benefit from this.
[02:54:05.138 --> 02:54:09.239]  Even people in the Republican National Committees have been saying, we need more terrorism.
[02:54:09.299 --> 02:54:12.180]  So who is the terrorist who's advocating violence?
[02:54:12.260 --> 02:54:14.901]  They even write national articles saying they need terror.
[02:54:14.921 --> 02:54:15.442]  They're sick.
[02:54:15.742 --> 02:54:16.402]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:16.942 --> 02:54:18.343]  Ivan in Texas, final call.
[02:54:18.363 --> 02:54:19.123]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:54:20.427 --> 02:54:21.748]  Hello, how are you doing Alex?
[02:54:22.729 --> 02:54:22.969]  Good, sir.
[02:54:22.989 --> 02:54:26.811]  Yes, I'm out here out of Dallas, Texas, and I have three things that I want to comment on.
[02:54:26.851 --> 02:54:29.013]  I want to see if you could also return some comment on them.
[02:54:29.413 --> 02:54:39.560]  The first one is I recently read in a newspaper out of the Dallas Morning News that Bush planned to move to Dallas, Texas to retire when he was built as president.
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:39.940]  Yes.
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:44.984]  And to start an international organization for peace that was also headquartered out of Dallas.
[02:54:45.784 --> 02:54:47.705]  And do you know any information about that?
[02:54:47.845 --> 02:54:48.466]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:49.780]  It's true.
[02:54:50.140 --> 02:54:56.404]  Do you know anything about what he plans to do out of Dallas, Texas?
[02:54:56.504 --> 02:54:59.865]  I mean, he's just going to profit off of all of his crimes and the things he's done.
[02:55:00.205 --> 02:55:01.226]  Listen, your phone's real bad.
[02:55:01.246 --> 02:55:02.186]  I appreciate your call.
[02:55:02.687 --> 02:55:04.227]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:04.267 --> 02:55:15.073]  If you missed any of the analysis or news or my Ron Paul take on everything that's happened or on the real threats we face as a society, you go to InfoWars.com.
[02:55:15.093 --> 02:55:19.075]  The three hours you just heard, if you missed any of it, restarts back-to-back at InfoWars.
[02:55:19.901 --> 02:55:23.762]  I'm not doing this for nothing and this is so incredibly dangerous what I'm doing and certainly it is.
[02:55:23.782 --> 02:55:29.244]  I just don't even like the feeling of it but I also feel good about what I've done.
[02:55:48.436 --> 02:55:53.957]  I don't like the feeling of knowing a scum wants to have their way with me, but I'm, look, I've made a sacrifice, you all know it.
[02:55:54.817 --> 02:55:58.418]  We all need to make more sacrifices and together we can overwhelm and defeat these people.
[02:55:58.978 --> 02:56:01.958]  Just get aggressive, never stop, and never compromise.
[02:56:02.438 --> 02:56:05.839]  If it's crazy sounding to say the elite want to kill 80% of us, we can't shut up about it.
[02:56:06.219 --> 02:56:07.219]  We have to talk about it.
[02:56:07.579 --> 02:56:08.319]  Because it's the truth.
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:14.661]  It sounds horrible that the government's killed tens of thousands of Americans in chemical, biological, radiological tests.
[02:56:14.821 --> 02:56:16.221]  It's the truth, we have to talk about it.
[02:56:16.541 --> 02:56:17.101]  It's admitted.
[02:56:18.484 --> 02:56:22.427]  TruthNews.us, PrisonPlanet.com for continual coverage of the Ron Paul Money Bomb.
[02:56:22.448 --> 02:56:23.929]  I want to thank all of you that contributed.
