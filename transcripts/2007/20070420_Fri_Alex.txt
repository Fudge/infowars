[00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.989]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:07.710]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.511]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:11.012]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.752 --> 00:00:12.653]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.955]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:21.617]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:25.519]  Aloha, America.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.281]  This is not Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:35.095]  I'm Mike Rivero and I'm live from Honolulu, Hawaii.
[00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:45.801]  And Alex is out doing what Alex does best all the time, finding out the corruption of the New World Order, and he's graciously shared his microphone with me today.
[00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:51.404]  I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the current developments we're seeing in the news.
[00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:57.408]  Once again, we're seeing hate crimes legislation being put into place.
[00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:02.256]  And you know sometimes hate and anger get a bad rap.
[00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:03.476]  Bad things.
[00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.917]  We're not supposed to throw by ourselves hate and anger.
[00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:12.518]  But the reality is that some institutions, they deserve to be hated.
[00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:14.578]  I hate liars.
[00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:16.219]  I hate cheats.
[00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.979]  I hate thieves.
[00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.519]  I hate murderers.
[00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.019]  I hate child molesters.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.640]  And you should too.
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.800]  If you don't, there may be something wrong with you.
[00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:27.361]  Hate can provide the drug.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.280]  We're good to go.
[00:01:58.345 --> 00:01:58.925]  Good, thanks.
[00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:26.996]  But my harshest hatred for political... Why their nation... It sets off until we break it up.
[00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.032]  Now, let's get back to the Constitution of the country.
[00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:40.478]  United States has a contract with the... It lays out government can... There are voices in the street, and the sound of running feet.
[00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.721]  And they whisper the words, Revolution.
[00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:50.644]  There are men coming down from the valley.
[00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:55.767]  There are tall ships flying off the coast.
[00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.956]  And they carry the light in the dark of the night like a whisper in the wind.
[00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:09.358]  Alex.
[00:03:09.378 --> 00:03:13.401]  Equally and unconscionably.
[00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:18.825]  By the sea we will gather for the fight.
[00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:23.568]  It's been so many years.
[00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:36.543]  So many tears we have lost once before Now we'll settle the score when our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.450]  We're good to go.
[00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:45.725]  Let us march and roll up the rocky hills tonight Under cover of the darkness We will slip behind the lines And we will take the men who have stolen our land For the years of domination hit the road
[00:05:00.732 --> 00:05:06.242]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:06.602 --> 00:05:14.255]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:14.935 --> 00:05:21.999]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:33.805]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.647]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.029]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.191]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:05:57.324 --> 00:06:02.406]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:02.466 --> 00:06:09.789]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:20.554]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:06:20.774 --> 00:06:25.296]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:30.583]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:06:30.803 --> 00:06:33.726]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:43.779]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[00:06:57.037 --> 00:07:01.798]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:06.019]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.581]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:06.096]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:08.398]  And welcome back to our show.
[00:08:08.478 --> 00:08:10.059]  This is Mike Rivero.
[00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:13.282]  I'm the webmaster of WhatReallyHappened.com, sitting in for Alex.
[00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:16.873]  Who's out and about doing what Alex Jones does best.
[00:08:17.614 --> 00:08:19.795]  We had some technical problems during that first segment.
[00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:24.238]  We've obviously cleared those up with the help of John, our technical wizard and expert.
[00:08:24.658 --> 00:08:26.820]  So we're getting back into our show right now.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.762]  The topic today is the lie of the century.
[00:08:29.802 --> 00:08:34.565]  The lies that tricked our nation into what is proving to be a disastrous war in Iraq.
[00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:41.150]  And I open to the first segment talking about the idea that it's not always a bad thing to
[00:08:41.846 --> 00:08:45.849]  Hate certain things, certain actions, certain people, if they deserve to be hated.
[00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:47.150]  It's okay to be angry.
[00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:54.456]  Sometimes it's an appropriate survival response to be angry about the things that are going on and being done in the name of your country.
[00:08:55.337 --> 00:09:03.444]  So, I'd like to kick off this segment by playing back this little soundbite from President Bush from his 2003 State of the Union speech.
[00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:10.530]  The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.
[00:09:12.043 --> 00:09:24.130]  Okay, now the hard reality is that the government, primarily George Bush, but with a lot of help, lied to us all about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
[00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:30.854]  Nobody ever found any active biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons following the invasion of Iraq.
[00:09:31.514 --> 00:09:39.859]  All that was found and waved around for the media were the rusted remains of weapons that the United States had sold to Iraq to use against Iran.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.180]  Of course,
[00:09:41.627 --> 00:09:43.868]  Bush is never going to admit to us that he lied.
[00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:51.131]  Government actually functions a lot like religion, in that it relies upon the blind faith of the people being ruled.
[00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:56.694]  And like religion, government can never admit error, lest it trigger a crisis of faith.
[00:09:57.454 --> 00:10:05.998]  It took the Vatican 500 years to admit that maybe they were a little bit wrong about Galileo, and the US government is just as protective of their illusion of infallibility.
[00:10:06.578 --> 00:10:10.360]  So, anybody who's sitting around waiting for the government to admit that they did something wrong,
[00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:14.567]  It's a waste of time and don't bother move on to other more important things.
[00:10:15.887 --> 00:10:26.352]  Now the above soundbite that I just played was from President Bush's 2003 State of the Union speech and we're going to use that as just one example to document the fact that we're dealing with lies.
[00:10:26.552 --> 00:10:34.516]  Not with mistakes of analysis, not with intelligence failures, not with we misread the tea leaves, but deliberate intentional lies.
[00:10:34.916 --> 00:10:38.998]  The idea was that since Israel had already bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor
[00:10:39.881 --> 00:10:43.043]  Because they thought it was a weapons lab and it wasn't as it turned out.
[00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:50.629]  The only reason Iraq was supposed to be buying uranium from Nigeria in Africa was in order to make bombs.
[00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:58.475]  Now the claim that Iraq was buying uranium from Nigeria was absurd to begin with because Iraq has plenty of natural uranium inside its own borders.
[00:10:58.735 --> 00:11:00.877]  It doesn't need to go to other countries.
[00:11:01.397 --> 00:11:02.058]  But the whole
[00:11:02.602 --> 00:11:16.552]  The claim that Iraq was buying this uranium that Bush used in his State of the Union speech was put forward on the basis of some very questionable documents that turned out on inspection to be very crude forgeries.
[00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:25.659]  The IAEA declared them to be forgeries when they first appeared and anybody doing a quick web search would have verified that the wrong names were on those documents
[00:11:26.612 --> 00:11:27.553]  They were outdated.
[00:11:27.933 --> 00:11:33.315]  It was very easy to prove that these were forged documents, if anybody bothered to check.
[00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:40.699]  Now, the Italian Parliament investigated the forgeries and named four suspects as the probable forgers.
[00:11:41.019 --> 00:11:49.203]  Amit Chalabi, Francis Brooks, Dewey Claridge, and Michael Ledeen, who figures quite prominently in a lot of the neocon policies put forward by this administration.
[00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:56.513]  The Italian intelligence service SISMI warned the CIA that the documents were forgeries before Bush's State of the Union speech.
[00:11:57.174 --> 00:12:05.838]  The CIA sent former ambassador Joe Wilson to investigate the claim of Iraq buying uranium and he came back saying there was no proof whatsoever of the story.
[00:12:06.499 --> 00:12:14.903]  Despite this warning, President Bush went ahead and made the claim in his State of the Union speech that Iraq was buying uranium from Africa.
[00:12:15.441 --> 00:12:26.990]  When Joe Wilson wrote an article exposing the deception, the White House launched this smear campaign to discredit him, during which Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, was outed as a CIA agent.
[00:12:27.591 --> 00:12:41.822]  Now, not only did this end Valerie Plame's CIA career, it also wrecked the cover of Brewster Jennings Associates, which was the CIA front, whose real job was tracking third-world nuclear weapons.
[00:12:41.942 --> 00:12:44.684]  So in the course of this whole attempt to cover up this lie,
[00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:55.609]  The Bush White House actually destroyed one of our best and most potent capabilities for finding out what was really going on with nuclear weapons in other parts of the world.
[00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.873]  So it was a very, very reckless thing for them to be doing.
[00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:06.400]  Now this kind of smearing by the White House, this is not the action of somebody who is saying, ooh, we may have a problem here with some of our information.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.302]  We should find out what the truth is.
[00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:16.159]  No, these are the actions of somebody who is going to, basically they know they've been caught lying and they're trying to keep the lid on that lie.
[00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:20.321]  Now, it's a funny thing about fake evidence.
[00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:31.665]  The fact that Bush relied on those forged documents and Tony Blair tried to sell us all his dodgy dossier proves that everything they were saying was a lie and here is why.
[00:13:32.285 --> 00:13:38.628]  If you have real evidence that supports a claim you're making, Iraq has weapons of mass destruction in this case,
[00:13:39.258 --> 00:13:48.962]  You don't risk contaminating the real evidence with fake evidence, because if the fake evidence gets exposed, it casts doubt on all the real evidence you have.
[00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:59.867]  Therefore, the fact that Bush and Blair were resorting to fake evidence proves they knew they had no real evidence that Iraq had the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:14:00.668 --> 00:14:06.030]  It was all fake, which means the lies about Iraq are in fact intentional.
[00:14:06.831 --> 00:14:07.491]  They lied,
[00:14:08.337 --> 00:14:09.938]  Our young American kids died.
[00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.998]  Their families cried.
[00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:14.339]  You should be angry about this.
[00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:14.799]  I am.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.881]  If you're not, if you're not angry over these lies, there's something, there's something wrong there.
[00:14:21.202 --> 00:14:27.124]  Now Mark Twain once wrote that truth is the most valuable commodity that we have, so let us economize it.
[00:14:28.004 --> 00:14:33.546]  And it certainly seems as if the government is in fact trying to economize truth wherever they find it, whether it's on
[00:14:34.713 --> 00:14:42.257]  Websites like WhatReallyHappened.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, or certainly on radio shows like here at Alex Jones.
[00:14:43.597 --> 00:14:52.382]  So we're talking here about the lie of the century, which to me is the lie that sent our American kids off to be killed and crippled in a war of conquest.
[00:14:53.722 --> 00:15:02.807]  And along the way, a lot of what the United States is supposed to stand for, the very qualities which we look to as justification for our moral leadership of the world,
[00:15:03.243 --> 00:15:04.204]  They're all gone.
[00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:06.605]  The Bill of Rights is all but gone.
[00:15:07.685 --> 00:15:09.927]  Right now, the Bill of Rights is under attack.
[00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:14.609]  The government can spy on you without warrants, without telling you.
[00:15:14.909 --> 00:15:18.791]  They can come into your home, plant bugs, look at your computer without even letting you know they've done it.
[00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:25.915]  They can read your mail, listen to your phone conversations, study what medicines you take, what books you read, who you associate with.
[00:15:26.502 --> 00:15:33.143]  They can use the GPS inside all modern cell phones to keep an eye on where you happen to go should you attract their interest.
[00:15:34.263 --> 00:15:38.544]  The United States has become a nation that tortures prisoners, sometimes to death.
[00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:45.765]  Iraqis were tortured to death to find the weapons of mass destruction which we now know never even existed.
[00:15:46.525 --> 00:15:49.166]  All you Franz Kafka fans have to be appreciating this one.
[00:15:50.706 --> 00:15:55.807]  The president can and has locked up people without charge and can hold them indefinitely
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:02.061]  Even though in many cases there's no evidence they've done anything wrong other than be an embarrassment to the US government.
[00:16:04.382 --> 00:16:15.484]  The highest duty of every American is to leave the next generation a better nation than that which was left to us and on this regard we have failed.
[00:16:16.364 --> 00:16:23.145]  The country we are preparing to leave to our children and their children is bankrupt financially and morally
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.603]  It is a nation that functions outside the rule of law, with no civil protections for the citizens.
[00:16:29.563 --> 00:16:33.845]  And you should be very, very angry about that, indeed.
[00:16:36.046 --> 00:16:38.207]  Now let's talk about complicity in lies.
[00:16:38.808 --> 00:16:42.610]  In fact, let's talk about some of the lies, because it wasn't just George Bush who was doing that.
[00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.891]  We had, let's see, here's some quotes.
[00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:49.733]  Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.
[00:16:49.813 --> 00:16:50.834]  George W. Bush.
[00:16:51.034 --> 00:16:52.855]  Statement to the UN General Assembly.
[00:16:53.999 --> 00:17:00.364]  Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons, December 2nd, 2002.
[00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:08.930]  If he declares he has none, meaning weapons of mass destruction, then we will know Saddam Hussein is once again misleading the world.
[00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.612]  Ari Fleischer Press Briefing, January 9th, 2003.
[00:17:12.632 --> 00:17:20.358]  In this case, we know that Saddam Hussein was telling the truth, and President Bush and Dick Cheney and Ari Fleischer were the ones who were lying.
[00:17:21.772 --> 00:17:24.453]  George Bush, we know for a fact there are weapons there.
[00:17:24.553 --> 00:17:32.597]  State of the Union address 2003, the same speech from which this soundbite about African uranium came from.
[00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:40.061]  We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction, is determined to make more.
[00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:42.863]  George Bush radio address February 8th, 2003.
[00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:45.684]  He didn't know that.
[00:17:46.484 --> 00:17:48.325]  He couldn't, because it didn't exist.
[00:17:48.986 --> 00:17:51.427]  In his letter of authorization starting
[00:17:52.031 --> 00:17:52.912]  The Iraq War.
[00:17:53.152 --> 00:18:00.418]  George Bush specifically mentions Iraq being in violation of UN resolutions regarding the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:09.365]  Now that we know George Bush lied in making that statement to Congress, the congressional authorization for the use of force in Iraq was not legally in effect.
[00:18:10.466 --> 00:18:20.714]  This alone, under US law, makes the war in Iraq illegal and its perpetuation a war crime by any reasonable definition of the word.
[00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:34.142]  If Iraq had disarmed itself, gotten rid of its weapons of mass destruction over the past 12 years, or over the last several months since UN Resolution 1441 was enacted, we would not be faced in the crisis we have before us now.
[00:18:35.143 --> 00:18:40.245]  But the suggestion that we are doing this because we want to go into every country in the Middle East and arrange all its pieces is not correct.
[00:18:40.465 --> 00:18:42.626]  Colin Powell remarks to the UN Security Council.
[00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:45.627]  The weapons of mass destruction weren't there.
[00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:51.990]  Therefore, the suggestion that this was being done simply to intervene in the Middle East, to the benefit of the United States and its allies,
[00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:54.699]  is the only remaining explanation.
[00:18:57.961 --> 00:18:59.461]  There are many, many more of these.
[00:18:59.481 --> 00:19:01.622]  You can look them up on the World Wide Web.
[00:19:01.803 --> 00:19:07.965]  But the bottom line is that every one of these statements about Iraq's threat to the United States was a complete lie.
[00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:15.109]  Because even if Iraq had had nuclear weapons, they would have never dared use them against the United States because the US has nuclear weapons.
[00:19:15.389 --> 00:19:19.451]  And more to the point, the missiles to carry them all the way from the United States to Iraq
[00:19:19.955 --> 00:19:24.378]  Iraq couldn't have ever reached the United States, even if it had these weapons.
[00:19:24.739 --> 00:19:26.940]  It was never a threat to the U.S.
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:32.384]  because of all those missiles that we have paid for and put in submarines and silos.
[00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:34.606]  This brings us to the end of this segment.
[00:19:34.646 --> 00:19:38.048]  We're going to be taking calls starting in our next segment.
[00:19:38.188 --> 00:19:38.769]  The phone number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:39.809]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:40.490]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:51.032 --> 00:19:51.836]  We're good to go.
[00:19:57.671 --> 00:20:05.938]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:06.198 --> 00:20:10.541]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:19.769]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:23.572]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:23.872 --> 00:20:28.897]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:29.198 --> 00:20:35.944]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:36.425 --> 00:20:36.965]  What about you?
[00:20:37.714 --> 00:20:43.056]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:20:58.141 --> 00:21:00.081]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:02.962]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:21:03.282 --> 00:21:11.584]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:21:11.884 --> 00:21:14.725]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:21:15.545 --> 00:21:18.765]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:21:20.086 --> 00:21:21.646]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:21:22.066 --> 00:21:22.987]  Take action now!
[00:21:23.127 --> 00:21:27.030]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.693]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:21:31.913 --> 00:21:35.135]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:21:35.255 --> 00:21:41.680]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.222]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:45.322]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:21:45.362 --> 00:21:46.963]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:21:58.407 --> 00:22:00.468]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:01.089 --> 00:22:10.035]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:10.476 --> 00:22:17.661]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:18.374 --> 00:22:23.880]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:35.211]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:35.952 --> 00:22:37.974]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:38.514 --> 00:22:41.298]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:22:41.338 --> 00:22:41.679]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:22:57.646 --> 00:23:04.154]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:23:04.374 --> 00:23:08.399]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:23:08.659 --> 00:23:10.801]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:23:11.162 --> 00:23:13.905]  All Natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem.
[00:23:14.205 --> 00:23:18.168]  The dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:23:18.488 --> 00:23:21.109]  Non-X nail gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:23:21.369 --> 00:23:24.892]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:23:25.152 --> 00:23:28.094]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:23:28.374 --> 00:23:33.037]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:23:33.437 --> 00:23:34.938]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:23:35.198 --> 00:23:38.640]  You'll find Non-X gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.660]  We're good to go.
[00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:15.007]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:18.988]  This is your guest host, Mike Rivero, sitting in at the microphone today.
[00:24:19.028 --> 00:24:29.410]  We're talking about the lie of the century, the lies that have sent our young American men and women into Iraq and Afghanistan to be killed, crippled.
[00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.271]  Some of them are coming home poisoned with depleted uranium.
[00:24:32.691 --> 00:24:39.413]  There is currently an epidemic of severe birth abnormalities among the children of veterans of the Iraq Wars.
[00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:46.472]  And it is a terrible, terrible price for them to have to pay for a war that is based on lies and deception.
[00:24:47.312 --> 00:24:51.333]  I have a few comments to make here, and then we're going to go to the phone lines, because they're certainly filling up.
[00:24:52.893 --> 00:25:08.438]  And I want to talk about the complicity in the lies, because we have, all the members of Congress, we have all the members of the mainstream media, we're sitting there saying, we didn't know, we were fooled to, we were victims, golly they lied to us, but
[00:25:09.153 --> 00:25:10.854]  I don't believe that and I'll tell you why.
[00:25:11.194 --> 00:25:13.655]  In fact, the comment I have for that is bull biscuits.
[00:25:14.455 --> 00:25:34.203]  The idea that the Congress and the mainstream media did not know the president was lying rests on this theory that Congress and the TV networks with budgets in the millions and staffs in the hundreds did not see the obvious signs of deception that bloggers and independent radio stations like this one
[00:25:35.316 --> 00:25:35.596]  Uh, yes.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.943]  Well, they were talking about how we are leaving our children.
[00:26:11.725 --> 00:26:22.074]  The, uh, the problem has not been addressed, dear and severe, because what we are not leaving is any children.
[00:26:24.156 --> 00:26:30.201]  We... The devils keep murdering our children to further their agenda.
[00:26:31.282 --> 00:26:32.903]  And what we don't realize is that
[00:26:33.464 --> 00:26:37.568]  The white race has been slated for total extinction.
[00:26:39.229 --> 00:26:49.819]  We're not going to be... Okay, this is getting a little off the topic that we were talking about, which is the government lying us into a war, and I'd really like to stay focused on that if you don't mind.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.162]  Well, the government is lying.
[00:26:52.302 --> 00:26:53.943]  They're lying about all of it.
[00:26:54.744 --> 00:26:58.808]  And this is the agenda that the government has got.
[00:26:59.673 --> 00:27:04.875]  They have got to take away our guns so we can protect ourselves.
[00:27:04.955 --> 00:27:09.656]  It is in their agenda because they are being forced to do it.
[00:27:09.716 --> 00:27:18.019]  They have got to take away our guns and then they have got to leave us in the hands of the other races disarmed.
[00:27:19.399 --> 00:27:24.001]  Because they have got to totally, totally exterminate the white race.
[00:27:25.046 --> 00:27:30.508]  Okay well Harold we're going to have to move along because we got a lot of phone calls and very little time so thank you for the phone call.
[00:27:30.528 --> 00:27:31.928]  We're going to move to Chris in Texas.
[00:27:32.028 --> 00:27:32.669]  Chris are you there?
[00:27:33.489 --> 00:27:34.929]  Yeah, hey how you doing?
[00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:42.452]  Look, I was looking at, I might touch off a little, get off the subject here, but this is real important.
[00:27:42.512 --> 00:27:52.215]  The NPC photographs of that shooter, Virginia Tick, you look at number seven photograph, the bullets, look on the second row,
[00:27:53.157 --> 00:28:05.405]  The third bullet from the top down, you will see reflections on the copper head of other people in that room with Cho taking the pictures of those bullets.
[00:28:06.025 --> 00:28:06.606]  Have you seen that?
[00:28:07.526 --> 00:28:08.067]  Yes, I have.
[00:28:08.107 --> 00:28:14.631]  And I've also noticed in the videotape of Cho that was sent to MSNBC, at one point the camera is being moved while he's still on it.
[00:28:15.011 --> 00:28:16.852]  And there's a cough in the background as well.
[00:28:17.172 --> 00:28:20.034]  So yes, there were other people involved in putting this all together.
[00:28:20.114 --> 00:28:20.995]  And it wasn't just Cho.
[00:28:21.987 --> 00:28:23.708]  We'd like to move along real quick.
[00:28:23.848 --> 00:28:25.129]  Chris, thank you for the phone call.
[00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:26.769]  We're going to move to Art in California.
[00:28:26.869 --> 00:28:27.570]  Art, are you there?
[00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.691]  Be quick, we're almost to the end of this segment.
[00:28:30.231 --> 00:28:31.712]  Yeah, I'm going to go a little off the subject.
[00:28:31.772 --> 00:28:35.133]  I'm live in San Bernardino, and there was a bomb threat at a place where I work.
[00:28:35.873 --> 00:28:46.858]  And I was out by the trash cans, and one of the bomb specialists was leaving, and I had asked, you know, because they had said there was nothing in the box, and I asked, well, did you fingerprint it?
[00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:48.699]  He said, no, but you can.
[00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:50.540]  And I gave him a cop's little attitude,
[00:28:51.058 --> 00:28:55.281]  Then he, uh, he got mad and said, he said, uh, boy, you have an attitude.
[00:28:55.341 --> 00:28:58.904]  And I said, well, why didn't you, uh, uh, fingerprint it?
[00:28:58.924 --> 00:29:01.887]  He said, cause it was in the, uh, there was no bomb in it.
[00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:07.171]  And I said, well, if there was no bullets in the Virginia Tech shooter's gun, then nothing would happen.
[00:29:07.331 --> 00:29:08.312]  It's a what if question.
[00:29:08.352 --> 00:29:09.613]  You guys always go with the what if.
[00:29:10.794 --> 00:29:12.095]  And they weren't even cautious.
[00:29:12.555 --> 00:29:16.619]  We were driving right by and they didn't tell nobody that there was a bomb.
[00:29:16.859 --> 00:29:20.642]  Like they didn't like send out no, no, uh, how do you say?
[00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:25.893]  Okay, Art, yeah, we're at the end of this segment here, and Art, thanks a lot.
[00:29:25.913 --> 00:29:27.735]  I'll answer this on the other side of the commercials.
[00:29:27.775 --> 00:29:28.756]  Thank you for the phone call.
[00:29:28.996 --> 00:29:30.637]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:29:30.717 --> 00:29:31.458]  I'm Mike Rivero.

[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.922]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:49.032]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:50.914]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:54.605]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.431 --> 00:30:01.153]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:04.535]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[00:30:04.815 --> 00:30:06.877]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[00:30:07.197 --> 00:30:11.560]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:17.864]  SFR Green's Protector reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.
[00:30:17.924 --> 00:30:19.225]  So do something green.

[00:30:28.928 --> 00:30:31.410]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.792]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:30:34.513 --> 00:30:37.695]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:44.801]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:30:45.582 --> 00:30:47.783]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:30:48.164 --> 00:30:48.384]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:30:48.404 --> 00:30:48.884]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:30:57.995 --> 00:31:02.576]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:02.957 --> 00:31:05.898]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:06.218 --> 00:31:08.778]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:13.960]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:19.722]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:20.022 --> 00:31:22.983]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:31:23.183 --> 00:31:23.743]  We're good to go.
[00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:47.032]  We're good to go.
[00:31:58.775 --> 00:32:02.637]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[00:32:02.897 --> 00:32:06.760]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.

[00:32:58.055 --> 00:33:01.238]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:01.358 --> 00:33:06.402]  I'm your guest host, Mike Rivero, the webmaster of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:33:28.058 --> 00:33:33.883]  I want to reply back to what Art was saying about the bomb scare and why the police did not fingerprint the box.
[00:33:34.743 --> 00:33:42.069]  There is a tremendous overreaction going on right now where everybody is very twitchy and flinchy after what happened at Virginia Tech.
[00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:51.957]  And unless the police had a reason to think the box they were fingerprinting was actually planted by the hoaxer, there wouldn't be a real reason to fingerprint it.
[00:33:52.077 --> 00:33:56.240]  If it just happened to be a box that they said, oh, that might be the bomb, so forth and so on.
[00:33:56.801 --> 00:34:05.507]  So it's not entirely inappropriate for them to not bother doing any more forensics if they can't actually connect that box with the hoaxer.
[00:34:06.207 --> 00:34:14.833]  Now before we get back to the phone calls, and yes we do have a lot of people waiting and I'll get to all of them in a little bit, I want to relate a story that happened a few years back.
[00:34:14.933 --> 00:34:26.200]  Two Fox News reporters, Steve Wilson and Jane Aker, were assigned by Fox News to write a story on synthetic bovine growth hormone and what a wonderful boon it was
[00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:31.673]  to the American farmer because it made the cattle grow bigger and fatter and produce more meat and more milk.
[00:34:32.293 --> 00:34:43.579]  And as the reporters dug into the story, they began to find there were serious medical issues connected with the consumption of the meat and the dairy products from these treated cows.
[00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:51.122]  Fox News, under pressure from advertisers, ordered the reporters to remove the health concerns.
[00:34:51.563 --> 00:34:54.444]  The reporters refused because that was the heart of the story.
[00:34:54.844 --> 00:34:56.345]  Fox News fired them.
[00:34:56.892 --> 00:35:13.501]  The reporters sued and lost, ultimately, on appeal when a judge ruled that since there is no law requiring the mainstream media to tell the truth, networks are within their legal rights to fire any reporter who refuses to distort a news story when told to do so.
[00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:23.506]  Now, if advertisers are able to get the mainstream TV news to lie, it's a sure bet the TV news is not going to stand up to the government when it lies.
[00:35:24.608 --> 00:35:27.029]  Now, everyone likes to talk about mind control.
[00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:31.691]  You know, woo, weird mind control, and tinfoil hat types of stuff.
[00:35:32.191 --> 00:35:35.412]  The reality is, mind control is not some science fiction ray gun.
[00:35:35.912 --> 00:35:37.813]  It's not a machine with blinking lights.
[00:35:37.993 --> 00:35:39.354]  It's not drugs in the water.
[00:35:39.854 --> 00:35:42.395]  All mind control is, is information control.
[00:35:42.935 --> 00:35:47.177]  Controlling what the brain thinks, by controlling what the brain knows.
[00:35:47.337 --> 00:35:48.497]  That's what propaganda is.
[00:35:48.997 --> 00:35:53.179]  Giving to people, giving to your brain, only that information.
[00:35:53.672 --> 00:36:00.116]  Which will lead you to decide for yourself, and by your own free will, you think, to do what the government wants you to do.
[00:36:00.957 --> 00:36:03.158]  The polite term is called manufacturing consent.
[00:36:03.718 --> 00:36:07.561]  There's an impolite term, but I can't say that on the radio, but you can probably guess what it is.
[00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:16.186]  But the way you break free from the propaganda, the way you prevent that kind of mind control, information control, is to develop your own sources of news.
[00:36:16.626 --> 00:36:18.207]  Away from the official versions.
[00:36:18.368 --> 00:36:19.708]  Away from the press releases.
[00:36:19.768 --> 00:36:20.749]  Go out on the internet.
[00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:22.090]  Use search engines.
[00:36:22.443 --> 00:36:28.445]  Listen to the alternative radio shows that are trying to get the information about what's really going on out to you.
[00:36:28.505 --> 00:36:35.288]  And when you do that, when you develop your own news sense, then you've struck a blow for your own personal liberty.
[00:36:37.029 --> 00:36:38.309]  All right, let's take a few phone calls.
[00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:39.890]  We've got Troy in West Virginia.
[00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.030]  Troy, you're on the air.
[00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.691]  Yeah.
[00:36:43.131 --> 00:36:45.152]  Why do you hate America so much, you freak?
[00:36:46.672 --> 00:36:47.973]  Well, thank you for the phone call.
[00:36:48.013 --> 00:36:49.233]  And actually, I love America.
[00:36:49.293 --> 00:36:51.174]  It's the government I've got an issue with right now.
[00:36:52.169 --> 00:36:55.191]  Moving right along to Cal from San Francisco.
[00:36:55.251 --> 00:36:55.872]  Cal, are you there?
[00:36:55.892 --> 00:36:56.452]  I am.
[00:36:56.492 --> 00:36:57.273]  How are you doing, Michael?
[00:36:57.973 --> 00:36:58.874]  I'm doing just fine.
[00:36:58.914 --> 00:37:00.135]  Lovely town, San Francisco.
[00:37:00.175 --> 00:37:01.536]  My wife is from San Francisco.
[00:37:01.976 --> 00:37:03.377]  It is indeed sunny today.
[00:37:04.378 --> 00:37:04.818]  Ah, good.
[00:37:05.859 --> 00:37:16.586]  You know, I just want to talk about the difference between truth and belief, and I think a lot of 9-11 truthers are kind of misguided, because it's not about getting truth out.
[00:37:17.387 --> 00:37:19.268]  There's more than enough truth available.
[00:37:19.727 --> 00:37:20.327]  It's a good question.
[00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:50.385]  A lot of people are scared to change their paradigm from one of security to one of complete and utter chaos.
[00:37:51.726 --> 00:37:53.088]  There is a lot of denial.
[00:37:53.128 --> 00:37:55.590]  There's a lot of denial out there right now and we find it.
[00:37:56.051 --> 00:38:08.683]  So generally what we urge people to do is be gentle when you're presenting these facts because a lot of people as they're growing up, they're given this indoctrination at a very young age about what a wonderful country it is.
[00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:13.029]  And they actually begin to define themselves in terms of those beliefs.
[00:38:13.369 --> 00:38:27.241]  And this is why a lot of people, like the preceding caller, they're so caught up in patriotism because it's part of their identity, and they view any criticism of the government as a personal attack, and they will respond exactly that way.
[00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:31.365]  So a certain amount of gentleness, yeah, definitely, because you're dealing with beliefs.
[00:38:32.766 --> 00:38:36.569]  I think the challenge is really, you know, for people to understand
[00:38:37.225 --> 00:38:43.290]  How information is created for their consumption and like, you know, who is creating it and why?
[00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:53.058]  And, you know, it just takes a little bit more, you know, it takes the tiniest bit of critical thinking to understand where it's coming from and why.
[00:38:53.138 --> 00:39:01.085]  But if someone were to come up to you and some disheveled man that totally stank and were to tell you information, you wouldn't trust it.
[00:39:01.846 --> 00:39:04.247]  You wouldn't trust the source because you could see it, it's right there.
[00:39:04.667 --> 00:39:09.029]  But people don't trust the news because it's polished and it's told that it's true.
[00:39:09.049 --> 00:39:11.590]  And people are told that it's true.
[00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:18.572]  And they just have to take a closer look at corporate media and realize or take a look and see who corporate media serves.
[00:39:19.813 --> 00:39:20.973]  And it's not people.
[00:39:21.874 --> 00:39:23.014]  No, it definitely isn't.
[00:39:23.054 --> 00:39:25.275]  The people have to serve the people.
[00:39:25.717 --> 00:39:27.498]  We're going to move along here right now.
[00:39:27.578 --> 00:39:31.759]  Thank you for the phone call, Cal, and we're going to go with Skip, also calling us from California.
[00:39:31.819 --> 00:39:32.659]  Skip, you're on the air.
[00:39:32.699 --> 00:39:33.420]  What can we do for you?
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.761]  I think the last caller kind of set up what I'm going to say pretty well.
[00:39:39.622 --> 00:39:50.966]  I've got a new angle to the 9-11 Truth Movement, and I work in a restaurant here that's got a lot of employees, and pretty much the kitchen staff is all Mexican.
[00:39:52.048 --> 00:39:56.011]  So, what I've done is I've started giving out the DVDs to them.
[00:39:56.932 --> 00:40:05.459]  And, uh, first I started off, I handed a deception dollar out, and they all got it without, you know, understanding English or anything.
[00:40:05.479 --> 00:40:10.664]  So, one of the guys that works there, that understands it pretty well, I'm starting to explain everything to him and break it down.
[00:40:11.544 --> 00:40:17.149]  One thing that I noticed is that Mexicans are very, very, very patriotic.
[00:40:17.609 --> 00:40:18.690]  Even more so than, uh,
[00:40:20.154 --> 00:40:22.656]  Then most Americans seem to be that I deal with.
[00:40:23.537 --> 00:40:30.823]  So when I explain to them the FPP and they want to get rid of the borders and there's not going to be a Mexico, now they're starting to get really concerned.
[00:40:31.503 --> 00:40:43.513]  So I think if we take all the Mexicans that are coming in here and we do what we can to turn them into 9-11 truthers, that's going to be a whole arsenal of people on our side.
[00:40:44.974 --> 00:40:45.795]  What do you think about that?
[00:40:46.562 --> 00:40:56.230]  Well, I think anytime you reach out to anybody, the most important thing you can do is speak out publicly, as you are doing, because it's going to give other people the courage to speak out publicly.
[00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:14.524]  And you will be surprised to find out how many people are walking around who really have serious doubts about 9-11, who have serious doubts about the war in Iraq, who know in their hearts that the President has been lying all along, but they are afraid to speak out because they don't want to get in trouble, they don't want to be seen as un-American in the eyes of their peers,
[00:41:15.629 --> 00:41:20.492]  And they don't realize that most of the people around them actually think the same way that they do.
[00:41:20.872 --> 00:41:32.198]  So anytime you speak out, whether it's to the Mexicans in the kitchen, or to the people at church, or the people at the library, or your co-workers, or your friends, or whatever, anytime you speak out, you give others the courage to speak out.
[00:41:32.278 --> 00:41:37.941]  And when everybody's speaking out, then the government's ability to lie to us convincingly is basically destroyed.
[00:41:38.261 --> 00:41:40.243]  And that is really what is important.
[00:41:41.383 --> 00:41:41.743]  Skip?
[00:41:42.184 --> 00:41:42.644]  Anything else?
[00:41:43.484 --> 00:42:00.812]  Yeah, another thing is I noticed that in this area, when I go to the store, a lot of times I'm starting to get these dollars back that have a rubber stamp that says 9-11 was an inside job and underneath that it's www.infowars.com.
[00:42:00.832 --> 00:42:02.533]  So it's getting popular up here.
[00:42:02.633 --> 00:42:05.414]  But I think if everyone
[00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:19.120]  Managed to start doing that to bills it no matter what it forced people to be constantly be addressed with the issue of It's a very viral approach to to do this.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.542]  Yeah Okay, well skip.
[00:42:21.602 --> 00:42:23.723]  Thank you very much for your phone call.
[00:42:23.743 --> 00:42:24.644]  We're going to move along here.
[00:42:24.684 --> 00:42:29.788]  We've got Tom in Philadelphia Tommy you there Hello Hi, Tom.
[00:42:30.108 --> 00:42:30.288]  Hi.
[00:42:30.788 --> 00:42:32.129]  I wanted to talk about something.
[00:42:32.189 --> 00:42:34.271]  I saw in the Bloomberg report this week.
[00:42:34.291 --> 00:42:34.311]  I
[00:42:35.609 --> 00:42:48.858]  They were talking about the nickels and the pennies being more valuable than five cents and one cent, and so people are melting them down to get the cash value that way, and the government's going to go after them, fining them $10,000 if they find that.
[00:42:49.498 --> 00:42:57.544]  I was wondering, do you think this is part of the government's idea of pushing the cashless society, that they actually want this?
[00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:08.758]  No, I think what it comes down to is that the government and the Federal Reserve have so inflated our monetary supply that the actual dollars and cents is worthless.
[00:43:09.558 --> 00:43:12.401]  You know, I'm at the risk of giving my age away here.
[00:43:12.581 --> 00:43:16.604]  I grew up in a time when our coins actually contained their worth as precious metal.
[00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:18.606]  The dimes and quarters were made out of silver.
[00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:20.808]  The nickels were made out of real nickel.
[00:43:21.229 --> 00:43:22.670]  Pennies were still made out of copper.
[00:43:23.606 --> 00:43:33.112]  And then as the inflation began to really get out of control, the copper and nickel became worth more than one cent per penny and five cents per nickel.
[00:43:33.513 --> 00:43:38.856]  So they changed the metals to try and make the cost of each coin less, but they're not able to keep up with inflation.
[00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:52.465]  I posted an article today called the Dow is crashing, which has recalculated the stock market performance away from the inflating dollars and back into constant value metals or various other
[00:43:52.876 --> 00:43:57.157]  Mediums of exchange and shows that the stock market is actually in a major decline.
[00:43:57.257 --> 00:44:04.339]  It only looks like it's soaring because of the empty dollars that are flooding into the market from the Federal Reserve.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.961]  So I don't think this is part of any design plan.
[00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:13.562]  I think it's just an after effect of some very, very bad economic policy.
[00:44:14.262 --> 00:44:18.683]  Eventually, I know they'd like us to move to a cashless society, but there's always going to be a need for cash.
[00:44:19.065 --> 00:44:24.909]  I just think we're going to see the penny and the nickel go away, and our smallest unit currency in coin is going to be the dime.
[00:44:25.369 --> 00:44:26.009]  Thank you for your call.
[00:44:26.029 --> 00:44:28.731]  We're going to move along to Scott in North Carolina.
[00:44:28.831 --> 00:44:30.032]  Scott, are you there online?
[00:44:30.752 --> 00:44:31.713]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:44:32.253 --> 00:44:38.057]  I've been actually trying to get through and ask Alex a question about September the 11th, and maybe you can answer it for me.
[00:44:38.817 --> 00:44:43.540]  I was watching, and this was probably four months ago, on the History Channel, a documentary,
[00:44:43.996 --> 00:45:00.916]  And they actually had, I think it's five people that were actually in, I think it was either one or two of the World Trade Towers, you know, either WTC1 or WTC2, that when it collapsed, they were actually inside the building, they were on their way down, and they actually survived inside the building.
[00:45:01.136 --> 00:45:02.278]  They survived the collapse.
[00:45:02.882 --> 00:45:15.469]  Um, I guess my question is, if there were bombs in the buildings, how... I mean, I know they have the clips of the firefighters saying bombs in the building, but if there were bombs in the building, how is it possible for people inside the building to survive the collapse?
[00:45:16.669 --> 00:45:25.594]  Well, I think the term bomb is perhaps a misnomer, because we're not talking about somebody intent... trying to blow the buildings up, because that would be too obvious.
[00:45:25.874 --> 00:45:28.776]  What we're talking about are controlled demolition cutter charges.
[00:45:29.395 --> 00:45:35.576]  Which are going to cut through various critical beings, but their explosive force beyond that is very limited.
[00:45:35.877 --> 00:45:38.017]  But there's no question that people survived in the building.
[00:45:38.037 --> 00:45:40.398]  There were firefighters in some of the buildings.
[00:45:40.478 --> 00:45:49.820]  If you look at the Noday Brothers documentary, 9-11, you will see video of what it was like to be in the building as it sort of piled up, as it came down and piled up all around there.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:54.461]  So I don't see the two issues as being inconsistent at all.
[00:45:55.202 --> 00:45:59.223]  So thank you for the call, Scott, and we're going to move along here to Kenny in Virginia.
[00:45:59.343 --> 00:46:00.384]  Kenny, you're on the air.
[00:46:01.664 --> 00:46:02.424]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:46:03.205 --> 00:46:03.865]  I'm doing fine.
[00:46:04.185 --> 00:46:04.425]  Good.
[00:46:04.685 --> 00:46:06.866]  I've kind of been in a daze here.
[00:46:07.126 --> 00:46:19.050]  I live five minutes from the University here at Blacksburg, and I don't know what Alex's spin is on everything yet.
[00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:24.032]  I agree with him on the 9-1-1 stuff, but I really don't think there's anything here as far as a conspiracy or
[00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:34.897]  Well, I think if anything it is germane to the topic of today's show that the American public has become so distrusting of the government and the authorities that even some very wild conspiracy theories are given a great deal of credence and credibility
[00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:56.819]  Again, we need to look at the facts.
[00:46:57.259 --> 00:47:06.085]  We know from the evidence I mentioned before that this Cho individual had other people working with him on the videotape.
[00:47:06.585 --> 00:47:22.595]  But even if we take this incident exactly at face value as it presents to be, the guy just went nuts with a gun and shot a bunch of unfortunate people, it still proves once again that the police cannot protect you, the gun ban that was in place on the Virginia campus
[00:47:23.029 --> 00:47:24.230]  I cannot protect you.
[00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.852]  When a crime is committed, there are two people.
[00:47:26.892 --> 00:47:28.253]  There's the criminal and the victim.
[00:47:28.533 --> 00:47:33.557]  And the criminal's not going to protect the victim, so the victim must be empowered to protect themselves.
[00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:37.039]  And that strikes right at the heart of what the Second Amendment is all about.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.781]  We're going to move right along here.
[00:47:38.841 --> 00:47:39.882]  Thank you, Kenny, very much.
[00:47:39.902 --> 00:47:41.203]  We're going to go to Will in Virginia.
[00:47:41.263 --> 00:47:41.903]  Will, are you there?
[00:47:44.325 --> 00:47:44.545]  Will?
[00:47:44.925 --> 00:47:45.786]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:45.806 --> 00:47:46.867]  I got a bad connection here.
[00:47:46.927 --> 00:47:49.709]  I just want to thank you for covering for Alex today.
[00:47:50.413 --> 00:47:58.300]  I want to encourage the listeners to support Alex and the show by buying his tapes and books and so forth.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:04.324]  A gentleman called and asked how somebody could survive in those buildings if a bomb went off.
[00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:10.710]  Well, I remember how Adolf Hitler survived a bomb on the other side of the table leg from where he was.
[00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.252]  And it pretty well demolished the building.
[00:48:13.512 --> 00:48:14.253]  But he survived it.
[00:48:14.393 --> 00:48:16.374]  So it's not unusual.
[00:48:16.394 --> 00:48:17.115]  Those are big buildings.
[00:48:18.779 --> 00:48:21.641]  Absolutely, they were big buildings and enough people died there.
[00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:24.302]  For everyone who survived, I'm certainly very glad they got out there.
[00:48:24.342 --> 00:48:25.443]  Thank you very much, Will.
[00:48:25.783 --> 00:48:27.704]  Let's take Bill in Baltimore.
[00:48:29.745 --> 00:48:30.386]  Hi, how's it going?
[00:48:31.226 --> 00:48:31.967]  It's fine.
[00:48:32.007 --> 00:48:32.547]  You're on the air.
[00:48:32.587 --> 00:48:33.267]  What can we do for you?
[00:48:33.428 --> 00:48:40.291]  Yes, I was listening to an affiliate station the other day that's going to carry a show and they were talking about cognitive dissonance.
[00:48:42.272 --> 00:48:46.495]  I used to think of it as apathy, but I was going to college
[00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:48.459]  I'm working at the grocery store.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.841]  In 1991, I got up and I was watching the news and Bush gave his New World Order speech.
[00:48:55.941 --> 00:48:56.381]  Remember that?
[00:48:57.121 --> 00:48:57.782]  Yes, I remember.
[00:48:58.182 --> 00:49:07.224]  And it seems like, I can put my finger on it, and it seems like since 1993, our society, you know, people have been getting more and more detached from our society.
[00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:10.445]  Like, you see people driving and talking on a cell phone.
[00:49:11.025 --> 00:49:12.025]  Alex talks about it.
[00:49:12.785 --> 00:49:15.486]  Or you just look at somebody and try to make a connection with them.
[00:49:16.283 --> 00:49:18.364]  And it's like the lights are on, but nobody's home.
[00:49:19.004 --> 00:49:20.204]  There's a lot of denial.
[00:49:20.244 --> 00:49:21.385]  There's a lot of denial.
[00:49:22.205 --> 00:49:26.586]  Again, people's identities are based on their being American and living in a good country.
[00:49:27.146 --> 00:49:32.748]  And when they see the evidence in front of them that it's not the case, they're going to reject it because it's an attack upon their persons.
[00:49:33.208 --> 00:49:34.869]  Okay, Bill, thank you very much for the call.
[00:49:34.889 --> 00:49:36.649]  We're coming to the end of this segment.
[00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:39.210]  Do we want honest government?
[00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:40.510]  Yes, of course we do.
[00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:45.872]  We the people will have honest government only when we the people have the will and the anger
[00:49:46.448 --> 00:49:52.432]  The hate of liars enough to kick the bums out of office and into the streets hard enough to bounce twice.
[00:49:53.173 --> 00:49:57.676]  Then and only then are we going to have honest government and we're not going to have it one second before then.
[00:49:57.816 --> 00:50:02.080]  It is up to we the people to enforce truth in government.
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:09.205]  It is up to we the people to remove the liars from office before they send more of our young people off to die in pointless wars.
[00:50:09.926 --> 00:50:13.208]  Now the government has no reason to stop lying because it gets them what they want.
[00:50:13.953 --> 00:50:18.954]  They have no reason to investigate the lies that got us into this war, and every reason to continue to cover them all up.
[00:50:19.454 --> 00:50:27.855]  Now, don't expect the Democrats to help, because after all the work to get them in there, they're struggling as hard as they can to find any issue except the war to run on in 2008.
[00:50:28.095 --> 00:50:29.956]  Global warming?
[00:50:30.296 --> 00:50:31.216]  That didn't get traction.
[00:50:31.336 --> 00:50:32.696]  Now they're on to gun control.
[00:50:33.937 --> 00:50:35.497]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:50:35.517 --> 00:50:39.578]  I'm your guest host, Mike Rivero, webmaster of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:50:39.978 --> 00:50:42.138]  We'll be right back after these words of our sponsor.
[00:51:01.042 --> 00:51:06.489]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:14.480]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:15.194 --> 00:51:22.256]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:22.637 --> 00:51:34.060]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:37.962]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:38.342 --> 00:51:40.262]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:40.603 --> 00:51:44.444]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:57.771 --> 00:52:59.473]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:59.713 --> 00:53:03.397]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:03.738 --> 00:53:12.667]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:12.828 --> 00:53:17.713]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:17.913 --> 00:53:26.942]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:53:27.283 --> 00:53:33.249]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[00:54:06.125 --> 00:54:08.406]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.426 --> 00:54:09.947]  I'm your guest host, Mike Rivero.
[00:54:10.887 --> 00:54:14.829]  Now, we, the people, do not need the government to admit that they're lying to us.
[00:54:14.949 --> 00:54:19.031]  And if they want to go on lying and covering up, let them, because all they're going to do is marginalize themselves.
[00:54:19.111 --> 00:54:20.211]  Nobody is listening.
[00:54:20.651 --> 00:54:28.895]  The trust and faith that people had in our system of government, built up over 200 years, is gone, shattered with a couple of reckless, careless lies.
[00:54:29.515 --> 00:54:34.277]  It is okay to hate liars, especially those who lied to send our kids off to be killed and crippled in Iraq.
[00:54:34.679 --> 00:54:41.824]  It's okay to be angry, because anger will give you the strength to do what needs to be done, and we have plenty to be angry about.
[00:54:42.044 --> 00:54:48.129]  We're going to get back to the phones here in a minute, but I want to say thanks to John for twiddling our little dials on a very problematic board we had today.
[00:54:48.189 --> 00:54:50.050]  Thanks to Alex Jones for sharing his microphone.
[00:54:50.471 --> 00:54:54.494]  And a reminder that you should all visit PrisonPlanet.com
[00:54:55.273 --> 00:55:03.019]  And the available videos on Prison Planet TV, especially the Terror Storm DVD, which is available from Infowars.shop.
[00:55:03.059 --> 00:55:07.523]  You can call it 888-253-3139, toll free.
[00:55:07.963 --> 00:55:11.326]  And visit the websites, get the DVDs, share them with your friends.
[00:55:11.927 --> 00:55:16.350]  Alex encourages people to make copies and get them out there and get the word out there.
[00:55:16.831 --> 00:55:19.933]  So with that, let's grab a couple more phone calls here.
[00:55:19.953 --> 00:55:21.314]  We've got Richard down in Texas.
[00:55:21.394 --> 00:55:22.135]  Richard, are you there?
[00:55:22.155 --> 00:55:23.176]  I am.
[00:55:24.214 --> 00:55:35.484]  I just wanted to refer to an article that was on the Rents site this morning that gave a little bit different perspective on this killing up in Virginia Tech.
[00:55:35.925 --> 00:55:42.290]  And it really referred back heavily to the Kent State shootings that occurred back in the Vietnam War time.
[00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:47.695]  That was a completely peaceful protest and the National Guard opened fire, killed four kids,
[00:55:48.063 --> 00:55:48.203]  I think?
[00:56:06.821 --> 00:56:13.206]  You know, not to mention the Waco's, Ruby Ridges, and all the rest of it, you know.
[00:56:13.246 --> 00:56:23.555]  The number one reason for gun ownership, I think, aside from your personal protection, is to save off government tyranny, and God knows we've got that coming down the pike, and have for some time.
[00:56:24.356 --> 00:56:30.922]  Yeah, well that's what Thomas Jefferson wrote about when he said the reason for giving citizens the right to military arms.
[00:56:31.142 --> 00:56:32.243]  It's not about hunting or sports.
[00:56:32.645 --> 00:56:36.486]  But the reason to give the citizens military arms was to hold off tyrannical government.
[00:56:37.046 --> 00:56:40.907]  Gun grabs are what started the whole American Revolution with the battles of Lexington and Concord.
[00:56:41.447 --> 00:56:53.811]  And part of the problem I think we're facing here in the country is we've got too many people who are watching TV shows where the hero comes in at the end at the last few minutes before commercial break and whoops the bad guys and makes everything all better.
[00:56:54.271 --> 00:56:59.152]  So we've got too many people who know the country's in trouble but they're hoping Superman or Spider-Man or Batman
[00:56:59.694 --> 00:57:03.758]  Or any of these people are going to come in and say things at the end and they won't have to get involved.
[00:57:03.838 --> 00:57:05.319]  And folks, it isn't going to happen.
[00:57:05.619 --> 00:57:09.442]  If you want a better country, you are going to have to go out there and make it happen.
[00:57:09.682 --> 00:57:10.243]  Richard, thanks.
[00:57:10.263 --> 00:57:12.365]  We're going to try and squeeze Fred in here before the end of the show.
[00:57:12.425 --> 00:57:13.085]  Fred, are you there?
[00:57:13.846 --> 00:57:15.267]  Okay.
[00:57:15.287 --> 00:57:25.796]  I just want to go through some of these points on the shooting in Virginia as proof that the identity of this gentleman seems to have been contrived.
[00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:27.244]  I don't think so.
[00:57:50.441 --> 00:57:55.684]  Well, they're saying he's South Korean, so I don't think we're going to use this as a justification to go off to war.
[00:57:55.804 --> 00:58:01.148]  In fact, it looks like the saber rattling toward North Korea has backed off noticeably in the last few weeks.
[00:58:01.768 --> 00:58:05.390]  Well, but the point is that the whole, you know, there is no real investigation.
[00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:11.914]  And the facts as they have laid them out have to be false.
[00:58:12.094 --> 00:58:14.835]  Okay, Fred, I have to cut you off.
[00:58:14.915 --> 00:58:16.737]  I'm sorry, because we're at the end of our show.
[00:58:18.079 --> 00:58:24.242]  In hindsight, I should have taken the second hour, but we've run out of time, and I can't take any more phone calls.
[00:58:24.282 --> 00:58:27.544]  My apologies to everybody who tried to call and could not get through.
[00:58:28.545 --> 00:58:33.347]  My show tomorrow on the What Really Happened Radio Show will be looking at just who helped push us into these wars.
[00:58:33.627 --> 00:58:37.810]  In the meantime, visit Alex Jones' website, and tune in again next week.
[00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:42.912]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:47.935 --> 00:58:54.761]  Hello fo- Big Brother.
[00:58:55.402 --> 00:58:56.483]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:57.184 --> 00:58:58.325]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:58.345 --> 00:58:59.786]  You want answers?
[00:59:00.507 --> 00:59:01.388]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:01.408 --> 00:59:05.732]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:06.252 --> 00:59:10.376]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.669 --> 00:59:16.811]  We're good.
[00:59:29.853 --> 00:59:34.178]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show coming your way this 20th day of April 2007.
[00:59:35.439 --> 00:59:42.005]  I am Jack Blood, your narrator, your radio gun, filling in for Alex Jones today and possibly Monday.
[00:59:42.286 --> 00:59:43.407]  No, the show didn't end.
[00:59:43.567 --> 00:59:44.228]  It isn't over.
[00:59:44.288 --> 00:59:47.431]  We have two more hours of non-stop news.
[00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:54.114]  And InfoWarrior material for you today will also be taking your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:59:54.774 --> 01:00:03.677]  We have guests lined up for the third hour of the broadcast today, and potentially Alex Jones himself will join us on the program.
[01:00:03.717 --> 01:00:06.358]  Welcome aboard this Friday, April 20th.
[01:00:06.699 --> 01:00:10.480]  Of course, today is the anniversary of the Columbine shooting.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.942]  We have a lot more news and information for you regarding the VTech shooting
[01:00:16.072 --> 01:00:19.476]  There's more news coming in constantly as we move forward.
[01:00:19.496 --> 01:00:25.101]  We just feel a great obligation and a responsibility to report as much as we know.
[01:00:25.781 --> 01:00:32.828]  Obviously, you're not going to be getting some of these minute details on MSNBC, FOX, or even PBS.
[01:00:33.328 --> 01:00:41.956]  So we'll run that down for you today, including a lot of news regarding Gonzales.
[01:00:42.668 --> 01:00:43.048]  Yes.
[01:00:43.449 --> 01:00:44.770]  Gone Gonzalez.
[01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:46.311]  He is gone, folks.
[01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:54.678]  I don't know how much longer he can last, but I believe he used the term, I don't recall, 72 times yesterday in his testimony.
[01:00:55.319 --> 01:01:00.243]  We are looking for that clip now on YouTube to play it for you, but it is something else.
[01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:05.087]  Both sides of the aisle admonishing Mr. Gonzalez.
[01:01:06.005 --> 01:01:08.667]  And he looks pretty much to be history toast.
[01:01:08.887 --> 01:01:15.452]  We'll go over that with you on today's program as well, including part of the story that hasn't been reported too much.
[01:01:16.193 --> 01:01:20.496]  And that is, who was next in California after Duke Cunningham?
[01:01:21.697 --> 01:01:30.403]  Randall Duke Cunningham, of course, involved in some pretty bad things, including getting caught with his hand in the tail and caught with his pants down, literally.
[01:01:31.541 --> 01:01:51.231]  uh... and embarrassed in front of the entire world who was next in the plan by carol and to be investigated in california and i think we'll find it is a major booster and supporter of the war on terror in the war in iraq and so that is certainly part of this uh... so we'll talk about that washington state
[01:01:52.250 --> 01:02:02.195]  Really looked like they were going to steamroll right over and right with the biometric IDs, biometric passports, you know it as the Real ID Act of 2008.
[01:02:03.856 --> 01:02:16.062]  And massive outrage in the state of Washington, my home state, where I ran around in short pants as a little boy, has now decided to repeal and ban the Real ID Act.
[01:02:16.082 --> 01:02:18.963]  This is coming straight from the governor, so that's really good news.
[01:02:19.003 --> 01:02:20.164]  We'll report that as well.
[01:02:21.299 --> 01:02:35.691]  ABC and George W. Bush telling you to be sure to question your neighbor's behavior and turn them in if they have any odd type of behavior that could indicate that they are the next VTEC shooter.
[01:02:36.432 --> 01:02:42.617]  The Vermont Senate has adopted a resolution officially now to impeach President Bush.
[01:02:43.698 --> 01:02:48.102]  And Bill Clinton has come out and said that Al Gore, looks like Al Gore is going to run.
[01:02:48.142 --> 01:02:49.143]  He of course is still
[01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:53.200]  Backing his wife, allegedly, Hitler-y Clinton.
[01:02:53.741 --> 01:02:56.182]  So we have a lot of news to report for you today.
[01:02:56.202 --> 01:03:01.586]  We'll also again be taking your calls and breaking down even more news and information for the VTech shooting.
[01:03:02.547 --> 01:03:05.409]  This is the latest off the wires, MSNBC.
[01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:09.512]  A threat spurs 36 California schools to lockdown.
[01:03:09.572 --> 01:03:16.597]  Man turns himself in after saying that he would go on a VTech-like killing spree.
[01:03:17.429 --> 01:03:19.870]  This is out of Yuba City, California.
[01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:36.060]  Teachers locked down classroom doors, lowered shades, and kept nearly 22,000 school children inside all day, away from their parents, Thursday in two Northern California cities after a man threatened to go on a killing spree, inspired by the VTech massacre and the NBC clips.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:36.700]  Stay tuned, folks.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.361]  The Alex Jones Show will be right back after this.
[01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:59.932]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:04:00.172 --> 01:04:11.396]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:04:11.736 --> 01:04:16.558]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:16.958]  I think?
[01:04:35.848 --> 01:04:36.929]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:04:36.969 --> 01:04:37.549]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:37.849]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:04:52.885 --> 01:04:58.354]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:58.715 --> 01:05:06.368]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:14.082]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:14.482 --> 01:05:25.930]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:30.153]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:32.115]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:32.455 --> 01:05:36.238]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:51.115 --> 01:05:56.557]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:05:56.977 --> 01:06:01.698]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:06:02.098 --> 01:06:04.719]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:05.219 --> 01:06:08.640]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:09.401 --> 01:06:13.722]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:14.162 --> 01:06:17.363]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:17.943 --> 01:06:20.804]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:21.582 --> 01:06:23.723]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:23.763 --> 01:06:25.823]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:06:25.843 --> 01:06:25.883]  U.S.
[01:06:26.203 --> 01:06:27.944]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:06:27.964 --> 01:06:28.324]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:29.144]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:06:29.164 --> 01:06:29.845]  Ask for George.
[01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:55.041]  Big Brother.
[01:06:55.702 --> 01:06:56.782]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:57.462 --> 01:06:58.642]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:59.222 --> 01:07:00.063]  You want answers?
[01:07:00.803 --> 01:07:01.643]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:02.363 --> 01:07:06.344]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:10.645]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:22.225 --> 01:07:23.769]  Yeah, I think.
[01:07:32.955 --> 01:07:34.195]  Thank you for joining us today, folks.
[01:07:34.255 --> 01:07:35.756]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:35.836 --> 01:07:37.996]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[01:07:38.296 --> 01:07:41.297]  You're listening to the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:07:41.637 --> 01:07:43.698]  A ton of news to report, I'll be very honest with you.
[01:07:43.958 --> 01:07:45.878]  This happens very, very rarely.
[01:07:45.898 --> 01:07:52.400]  I prepare a good chunk of our editorial for the program, and we line up all the topics we want to talk about.
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:08:01.702]  I read through probably about 20 news stories a day to be able to pass along this information, educate you, put the pieces together for you on the program,
[01:08:02.942 --> 01:08:11.804]  And literally about 10 minutes before the show, the computer seemed to be attacked and is now locked hopelessly into oblivion.
[01:08:12.224 --> 01:08:19.166]  So we'll try to get to all of these stories for you today, but we'll go phone-heavy for the meantime at 800-259-9231, and I will attempt to resurrect my computer.
[01:08:19.366 --> 01:08:20.026]  It's amazing when you
[01:08:27.012 --> 01:08:40.226]  When you depend on technology and the technology doesn't work and of course we have become so reliant on this technology that when it doesn't work we really don't have any other options or any backup plans so
[01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:43.650]  That is a lesson to all you kiddies out there.
[01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:46.333]  That is the moral to the story, so to speak.
[01:08:46.914 --> 01:08:51.098]  We will be taking your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:56.424]  We'll hope, all in all, that we're able to get the show going for you.
[01:08:56.444 --> 01:08:58.947]  In the meantime, we do have a clip.
[01:08:58.987 --> 01:09:00.289]  John, you said you had that clip ready.
[01:09:01.209 --> 01:09:04.432]  About Alberto Gonzales, as I like to call him.
[01:09:04.712 --> 01:09:06.553]  We've got a lot of names for you, Alberto.
[01:09:06.593 --> 01:09:22.224]  Maybe if you're listening to the show and you'd like to know about this, you are Alberto I Love Torture Gonzales, you are Alberto Anti-Gonzales, Alberto La Raza Gonzales, and now you are just simply Alberto Gonzales.
[01:09:22.284 --> 01:09:28.048]  And while that might be good news, let's remember that we thought Ashcroft was about the worst
[01:09:28.823 --> 01:09:38.330]  Attorney General we could ever have, and well, they managed to find somebody even worse in Garm Zalas, who appears to be toast, as I mentioned earlier.
[01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:43.654]  So why don't we go ahead and play that clip, and then we'll go right to some of your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:09:43.694 --> 01:09:45.295]  Again, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:45.575 --> 01:09:52.220]  This is an NBC News clip, just a kind of a conglomerate, an amalgamation of some of the testimony yesterday.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.402]  I think you'll get a pretty good feel to what you might have missed.
[01:09:55.422 --> 01:09:56.103]  Go ahead and roll that, John.
[01:09:56.710 --> 01:10:08.276]  And while all of this continued to play out today, a drama was playing out in a hearing room in Washington that may decide whether or not the Attorney General of the United States keeps his job.
[01:10:08.816 --> 01:10:12.337]  Alberto Gonzalez was grilled today about those fired U.S.
[01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:15.599]  attorneys in our report tonight from NBC's Chip Reid.
[01:10:17.007 --> 01:10:17.788]  Raise your right hand.
[01:10:17.868 --> 01:10:26.814]  With his job possibly on the line, Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez today vigorously defended his controversial decision to fire eight U.S.
[01:10:26.874 --> 01:10:29.896]  Attorneys, denying that politics played any role.
[01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:30.716]  U.S.
[01:10:30.756 --> 01:10:32.717]  Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President.
[01:10:33.778 --> 01:10:36.680]  There's nothing improper in making a change for poor management.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:41.063]  But Senators from both parties found his explanation hard to believe.
[01:10:41.083 --> 01:10:42.584]  Most of this is a stretch.
[01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:52.352]  I think it's clear to me that some of these people just had personality conflicts with people in your office or at the White House and, you know, we made up reasons to fire them.
[01:10:52.612 --> 01:10:56.577]  Gonzalez took responsibility for what he called a flawed process.
[01:10:57.057 --> 01:10:58.219]  I clearly made mistakes here.
[01:10:58.939 --> 01:10:59.260]  Clearly.
[01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:03.085]  And I accept responsibility for those mistakes, Senator.
[01:11:03.185 --> 01:11:09.689]  But conservative Republican Tom Coburn said responsibility should have consequences, then dropped a bombshell.
[01:11:09.889 --> 01:11:13.031]  I believe the best way to put this behind us is your resignation.
[01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:26.920]  Gonzalez admitted he initially understated his role in the firings, but despite documents suggesting he had a more significant role, he continued to insist today his involvement was quote, limited, leaving some senators dumbfounded.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.022]  Your characterization of your participation is just
[01:11:31.612 --> 01:11:34.434]  Significantly, if not totally, it varies with the facts.
[01:11:34.654 --> 01:11:36.455]  Who's telling the truth around here?
[01:11:36.475 --> 01:11:42.960]  Democrat Chuck Schumer questioned his candor and warned Gonzalez to keep, I don't recall, responses to a minimum.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.200]  Senator, I don't recall that.
[01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:46.042]  Senator, I can't recall.
[01:11:46.382 --> 01:11:47.243]  I do not recall.
[01:11:47.263 --> 01:11:53.047]  He said it more than 70 times, according to a protester keeping a tally for all to see.
[01:11:53.848 --> 01:11:57.214]  Whether Gonzalez stays or goes is up to President Bush.
[01:11:57.334 --> 01:12:01.903]  Late today, the White House said Gonzalez still has the President's full confidence.
[01:12:02.163 --> 01:12:03.887]  Chip Reid, NBC News, The Capitol.
[01:12:05.163 --> 01:12:14.733]  So there you go, 72 times, I don't recall, and he was admonished, I believe, by Orrin Hatch and others for not being prepared.
[01:12:14.753 --> 01:12:25.104]  In fact, in one of his testimony, some of his testimony a while back, he bragged about how prepared he is for these committee grillings.
[01:12:26.207 --> 01:12:47.373]  And that pretty much proves he's prepared to say, I don't recall, and let's just be very honest, there's no difference between Alberto Gonzales, Alberto anti-Gonzales, Alberto I love torture Gonzales, there is absolutely no difference between him saying, I don't recall, and Jimmy Hoffa or any of the Cosa Nostra taking the Fifth Amendment.
[01:12:47.393 --> 01:12:48.593]  That's exactly what he's doing.
[01:12:49.697 --> 01:12:51.019]  Is that his right to do?
[01:12:51.039 --> 01:12:56.085]  I mean, he is a public servant, and he does serve at the pleasure of we, the people.
[01:12:56.586 --> 01:12:58.248]  And we have a right to know.
[01:12:58.268 --> 01:13:06.979]  I mean, this isn't the same as him being a public citizen, a citizen like myself, like you might be here in this audience.
[01:13:07.479 --> 01:13:09.380]  There is a bit of a difference here.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.923]  Of course, they are protecting themselves and not putting anything on the record, and they should be very careful.
[01:13:14.963 --> 01:13:26.788]  We've just witnessed the first PNAC trial, that of Scooter Libby, who was found guilty, who will most obviously be pardoned by George W. Bush in a Mark Rich-style pardon, obvious to everybody.
[01:13:27.388 --> 01:13:34.895]  But they are deathly afraid that they will be brought up on any kind of perjury charge if they go on the record.
[01:13:34.955 --> 01:13:37.158]  So let's just all be very honest here.
[01:13:37.978 --> 01:13:47.648]  He's taking the Fifth Amendment and by saying he doesn't recall, he's protecting himself and he's protecting the White House from some extremely damning information.
[01:13:48.128 --> 01:13:48.869]  And yes,
[01:13:49.489 --> 01:13:57.931]  It is, and you've heard this on the news, and you've certainly heard this on the Lush Limbaugh program, the President has the right to fire the attorneys.
[01:13:58.011 --> 01:13:59.711]  There's absolutely no doubt about that.
[01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:09.253]  That is a legal procedure unless they are political firings, unless they are firings to cover up investigations of that very administration.
[01:14:09.313 --> 01:14:16.074]  So while you could have gotten away just a few years ago from saying, I don't recall, I don't recall, I don't recall, I'm not going to tell you,
[01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:24.465]  This is quite a different climate we live here in the year 2007, where the people have had it up to here.
[01:14:24.645 --> 01:14:27.348]  I'm making a sign up to my hairline.
[01:14:27.508 --> 01:14:30.130]  They've had it with the I don't recalls.
[01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:32.172]  They've had it with the lost emails.
[01:14:32.432 --> 01:14:39.479]  They've had it when they get caught in bald-faced lies, spinning that to a form of
[01:14:42.584 --> 01:14:45.205]  Uh, yeah, I don't recall, and I must have misspoke.
[01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:54.246]  I didn't actually lie, I just misspoke because I didn't recall, because I don't want to tell you anything, because you are just the useless eaters and cannon fodder out there.
[01:14:54.486 --> 01:15:01.148]  You have no imagination of what's going on in the New World Order, in the big world out there, in the big picture, and we're protecting you!
[01:15:01.428 --> 01:15:02.728]  Just trust us.
[01:15:04.088 --> 01:15:08.509]  Well, this didn't float too well yesterday in the Gonzales hearings, and as I mentioned earlier,
[01:15:09.409 --> 01:15:19.661]  Both Republicans and Democrats are quite upset at Mr. Gonzalez.
[01:15:19.701 --> 01:15:22.203]  There will have to be a beheading here.
[01:15:22.644 --> 01:15:23.405]  No pun intended.
[01:15:23.745 --> 01:15:25.387]  Don't come to my house, FBI.
[01:15:25.427 --> 01:15:27.109]  I'm only using a metaphor.
[01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:35.187]  There will certainly be a day very soon where I believe you'll see Alberto Gonzalez walking the plank, okay?
[01:15:35.228 --> 01:15:39.551]  They're kicking this rat off the ship and many other rats going with him.
[01:15:39.971 --> 01:15:45.075]  But of course, this is what happens when you take two big bites out of the apple and you press your luck.
[01:15:45.555 --> 01:15:47.337]  And this is absolutely why...
[01:15:48.699 --> 01:16:17.979]  uh... the philosophy of a brave new world order that is Aldous Huxley's work really giving us kind of more of the Pavlovian path to slavery rather than that would be Orwell's punishment to slavery method uh... this is why the Huxley method is the one that has to be employed because the people sooner or later will have enough and they will demand retribution they will demand public hangings and they will demand that the traitorous
[01:16:19.016 --> 01:16:24.457]  Treasonous public servants meet their justice.
[01:16:24.917 --> 01:16:25.237]  All right?
[01:16:25.357 --> 01:16:34.099]  And that's the top cop right there denying that he knows absolutely anything, and he has been proverbially outed.
[01:16:34.419 --> 01:16:35.979]  It is over for Gonzalez.
[01:16:36.019 --> 01:16:39.420]  Now we need to be thinking on who the next shill is coming in.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:43.681]  I wonder what other Bush attorneys might be looking for a job.
[01:16:43.841 --> 01:16:46.942]  Harriet Myers apparently has now gone to the private sector.
[01:16:46.982 --> 01:16:47.762]  That didn't float.
[01:16:48.542 --> 01:16:58.250]  I believe it was Greg Pallast on my program just the other day talking about how Harriet Myers was originally put into the Supreme Court justice position, which was laughable.
[01:16:58.910 --> 01:17:00.691]  Even the Republicans laughed at that one.
[01:17:01.212 --> 01:17:07.937]  That was unacceptable by everybody, including even our sometimes friend Lush Limbaugh, as I like to call him.
[01:17:08.921 --> 01:17:18.420]  uh... but it is great balance that she had something on bush okay this is really how the government works and this is how the power structure the new world order works you do not
[01:17:19.096 --> 01:17:21.517]  Ascend to public office.
[01:17:21.537 --> 01:17:40.402]  Do not ascend to captains of industry, or CEO, or do not climb the corporate ladder within the international banking system unless, number one, you have been initiated every step of the way to test your loyalty, and most importantly, that there is some dirt on you that can be used against you in case you fall out of line.
[01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:42.902]  Bill Clinton is really a perfect example of this.
[01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:47.984]  Of all the things they could have gone after Clinton on, the combinations of
[01:17:48.904 --> 01:17:56.846]  of thievery going on out of the Rose Law Firm, which of course was primarily run by Schillery Clinton or Hitlery Clinton, either way.
[01:17:57.426 --> 01:18:02.007]  The MENA drug smuggling in partnership with the Bush crime family.
[01:18:02.387 --> 01:18:08.249]  The multitude of escapades and the use of hard drugs, something he has in common with his brother.
[01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:11.950]  Then he calls on his brother, George W. Bush.
[01:18:12.450 --> 01:18:16.811]  No, they couldn't go after him on all of those things because they would have been implicated themselves.
[01:18:17.498 --> 01:18:18.299]  So what do you do?
[01:18:19.179 --> 01:18:27.585]  You take the dirt you have on Slick Willy, and you float it out for all the world to see, in order to take him down a few pegs on that ladder.
[01:18:27.605 --> 01:18:32.088]  This is how the system works, and that's why you and I aren't high up in the system.
[01:18:32.128 --> 01:18:36.552]  Because we have morals, we will not be initiated, and there is no dirt on us.
[01:18:36.572 --> 01:18:37.692]  We'll come right back after this, folks.
[01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:38.793]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:38.893 --> 01:18:39.794]  Infowars.com.
[01:18:50.169 --> 01:18:55.392]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:18:55.532 --> 01:19:03.616]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:19:03.876 --> 01:19:10.759]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:19:11.879 --> 01:19:18.361]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:19:18.562 --> 01:19:23.643]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:19:23.763 --> 01:19:32.646]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:19:32.906 --> 01:19:36.187]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:38.428]  I think?
[01:19:50.848 --> 01:19:52.870]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:53.130]  April 20, 2007.
[01:19:53.191 --> 01:19:54.091]  Gold is at $691.50 an ounce.
[01:19:54.112 --> 01:19:56.694]  Gold coins can be purchased for $714.51, $362.82 for half ounce, and $179.65 for quarter ounce coins.
[01:19:56.734 --> 01:19:57.135]  That's $714.51, $362.82, and $179.65.
[01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:11.990]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:15.053]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:20:15.153 --> 01:20:24.243]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:20:24.543 --> 01:20:29.849]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:20:30.309 --> 01:20:32.611]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:20:32.651 --> 01:20:35.092]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:20:35.472 --> 01:20:38.734]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.814 --> 01:20:42.497]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:20:42.557 --> 01:20:42.797]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.817 --> 01:20:43.017]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.624 --> 01:20:55.749]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:20:55.989 --> 01:20:57.751]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:20:58.011 --> 01:21:04.298]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:21:04.598 --> 01:21:10.725]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:21:10.965 --> 01:21:12.807]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:21:13.067 --> 01:21:13.488]  I think so.
[01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:38.851]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.080]  We're good to go.

[01:23:11.124 --> 01:23:12.927]  Thank you for joining us today, folks.
[01:23:12.947 --> 01:23:14.729]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:14.749 --> 01:23:17.052]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:23:17.112 --> 01:23:19.896]  I'm Jack Blood, filling in for Alex today.
[01:23:19.956 --> 01:23:26.185]  He should be joining us here in just about 10 minutes to give us some breaking news and some updates on the Virginia Tech shooting.
[01:23:26.225 --> 01:23:27.807]  He's been working on that non-stop.
[01:23:28.559 --> 01:23:40.889]  The third hour today we'll be talking to the Save America Fund, which are sponsoring the trucker protests, trucker rallies, and trucker strikes here, I believe, coming up next week.
[01:23:40.909 --> 01:23:42.870]  So we'll talk about that a little bit as well.
[01:23:43.331 --> 01:23:45.492]  We're also going to be taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:45.512 --> 01:23:47.314]  Anything that you want to talk about should be fine today.
[01:23:50.716 --> 01:24:00.582]  I just want to say that if you haven't gone out there and gotten Terror Storm, if you haven't gone to the InfoWars store, there are so many great things including t-shirts and bumper stickers.
[01:24:00.882 --> 01:24:03.464]  Great way to get the word out, to spread the word.
[01:24:03.904 --> 01:24:06.386]  And I'll tell you, this happens to me all the time.
[01:24:06.426 --> 01:24:07.927]  In fact, I'll give you a quick anecdote.
[01:24:07.947 --> 01:24:11.529]  When we were locking in to do the big
[01:24:12.498 --> 01:24:16.944]  Conference here, Rebuilding America's Senses at the University of Texas.
[01:24:17.044 --> 01:24:26.277]  I was looking for a parking spot and I needed some money to feed the meter, as you know, so I went into a little pizza joint and I was wearing a 9-11 shirt.
[01:24:27.678 --> 01:24:30.940]  This particular shirt said, Buildings Don't Commit Suicide.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:31.980]  Or do they?
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:32.901]  Building 7.
[01:24:33.421 --> 01:24:36.582]  And the owner came up and he said, you know, Buildings Don't Commit Suicide.
[01:24:36.602 --> 01:24:37.843]  That was a controlled demolition.
[01:24:37.863 --> 01:24:43.585]  And we started talking and turns out he's a listener of mine and of Alex's here in Austin, Texas.
[01:24:43.705 --> 01:24:45.726]  And was very, very friendly.
[01:24:45.766 --> 01:24:47.987]  We brought him a lot of business over the weekend.
[01:24:48.107 --> 01:24:51.069]  A like-minded sole proprietorship.
[01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:53.270]  You know, mom and pop, a little restaurant.
[01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:55.491]  It worked out great for everybody.
[01:24:55.531 --> 01:24:59.612]  If I hadn't been wearing that t-shirt though, none of that would have happened.
[01:24:59.672 --> 01:25:13.058]  So wearing the t-shirts that are at Infowars.com, at the Infowars store, or getting the videos, making copies, you're authorized to do that for educational purposes, and getting those out by the thousands, that's what's changed the tide.
[01:25:13.539 --> 01:25:21.182]  And I always try to congratulate Alex for really starting this new phenomenon of making high-tier, highly produced films
[01:25:21.743 --> 01:25:25.028]  And making them available to everybody to get the information.
[01:25:25.369 --> 01:25:27.833]  Also, I know Loose Change has done a great job doing that as well.
[01:25:28.094 --> 01:25:29.777]  That's what's turned the tide!
[01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:34.099]  So let's of course put some money back into the kitty.
[01:25:34.559 --> 01:25:37.200]  Order the products from Infowars.com.
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.640]  Get the film Terror Storm.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.341]  If you haven't, there's actually a great offer right now.
[01:25:41.361 --> 01:25:46.762]  A two-pack special from Freedom of Fascism by Aaron Russo and Terror Storm.
[01:25:47.263 --> 01:25:48.603]  I think for an extra $10.
[01:25:48.963 --> 01:25:50.223]  So it's a great deal.
[01:25:50.303 --> 01:25:52.644]  It's about $39 if I remember for both the films.
[01:25:53.044 --> 01:26:04.770]  Which is roughly about 5-6 hours of information that is really important, will really turn people around, give them freedom to fascism, then let them watch Terror Storm, and I think they'll pretty much have it all figured out.
[01:26:05.050 --> 01:26:17.457]  Go to Infowars.com, go to the store, give them a call right now, and order the films, order the t-shirts, get the t-shirts, get the bumper stickers, get the paraphernalia, that supports the work that we're doing here at Infowars.com.
[01:26:17.737 --> 01:26:21.000]  Helps Alex to create more films, get the message out even more.
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:24.102]  He's got a lot of things in the kitty, a lot of things in the hopper.
[01:26:24.142 --> 01:26:26.644]  It's going to take money to do it, and he's going to need your help.
[01:26:26.664 --> 01:26:27.764]  We've come this far.
[01:26:28.065 --> 01:26:29.306]  Let's not stop now.
[01:26:29.346 --> 01:26:31.727]  Go to InfoWars.com, to the InfoWars store.
[01:26:31.928 --> 01:26:34.850]  Again, Alex should be joining us here in just a few minutes on the program.
[01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:36.211]  I would like to go to the phone.
[01:26:36.251 --> 01:26:38.973]  I'm told we have Andrew from Massachusetts.
[01:26:39.133 --> 01:26:40.874]  Taxachusetts, as I like to call it.
[01:26:41.374 --> 01:26:42.435]  A place I've lived before.
[01:26:42.495 --> 01:26:44.637]  Says he disagrees with something he's heard on this program.
[01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:45.737]  You're on the air.
[01:26:45.777 --> 01:26:47.298]  Go to the front of the line if you disagree.
[01:26:47.378 --> 01:26:48.398]  Andrew, thank you for calling in.
[01:26:48.418 --> 01:26:49.399]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:49.779 --> 01:26:50.259]  Thanks, Jack.
[01:26:50.339 --> 01:26:55.281]  I disagree with the approach you're taking, or that the program's taking in defending gun ownership.
[01:26:55.641 --> 01:26:58.863]  Gun ownership is a natural right and affordable to the people and the Constitution.
[01:26:59.003 --> 01:27:13.549]  And while I agree with your reasons justifying gun ownership, that depriving people of guns only disarms the victims, the point is moot because even if crime and murder increased with gun ownership, we cannot be deprived of our natural and constitutional right to own firearms and other weapons.
[01:27:14.116 --> 01:27:20.773]  Now I was wondering if you think making all sorts of justifications to own firearms is a disservice when it's afforded to us in the Constitution?
[01:27:21.957 --> 01:27:22.597]  What are you saying?
[01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:26.019]  That we shouldn't have to justify it because it's afforded in the Constitution?
[01:27:26.059 --> 01:27:34.424]  Salon.com right now is beating the bushes, no pun intended, and starting a campaign to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:27:34.444 --> 01:27:39.467]  And we've got four gun laws which will make it almost impossible for you to own a firearm.
[01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:44.890]  I watched Red Dawn last night when the Ruskies paratrooped in here and took over America.
[01:27:45.130 --> 01:27:49.032]  The first thing they did is go to the gun store and look for the list of the people that own the guns.
[01:27:49.372 --> 01:27:51.093]  So I'm not exactly sure what you're saying.
[01:27:51.113 --> 01:27:52.414]  Maybe you can be a little more clear.
[01:27:52.654 --> 01:27:54.455]  What exactly do you disagree with?
[01:27:55.275 --> 01:28:03.339]  Do you think making all sorts of justifications weakens the point for gun ownership when it's already been afforded to us as a natural and constitutional right?
[01:28:03.359 --> 01:28:07.161]  Do you know the skinny on this and what the gun grabbers like to say?
[01:28:07.241 --> 01:28:13.784]  They lump in militia and they lump in the right to own firearms as being part of the same
[01:28:14.284 --> 01:28:15.325]  We're on the march.
[01:28:15.345 --> 01:28:16.105]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:44.267 --> 01:28:47.029]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:50.051 --> 01:28:57.155]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program, a million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[01:28:57.535 --> 01:28:59.316]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[01:28:59.556 --> 01:29:04.999]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[01:29:05.199 --> 01:29:11.083]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[01:29:11.383 --> 01:29:13.805]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.
[01:29:14.005 --> 01:29:20.830]  No matter what network marketing venture you're involved in, MLM Incorporated can provide you the successful tools you need to truly succeed.

[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.582]  Plus so much more can't be mentioned in 60 seconds.

[01:29:49.908 --> 01:29:50.748]  Attention gardeners!
[01:29:50.808 --> 01:29:53.169]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:29:53.409 --> 01:29:57.732]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:29:57.932 --> 01:30:05.816]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:30:06.116 --> 01:30:08.958]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:30:09.238 --> 01:30:16.781]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:30:16.862 --> 01:30:22.464]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:30:22.704 --> 01:30:28.247]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:30:28.527 --> 01:30:31.749]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.

[01:30:43.661 --> 01:30:43.842]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:49.887 --> 01:30:50.408]  Hey, Emily!
[01:30:50.708 --> 01:30:51.609]  Wow, you look great!
[01:30:51.949 --> 01:30:52.750]  I feel great!
[01:30:52.991 --> 01:30:54.913]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:30:55.293 --> 01:30:55.593]  Really?
[01:30:55.834 --> 01:30:56.254]  What is it?
[01:30:56.394 --> 01:30:56.855]  How does it work?
[01:30:56.975 --> 01:31:03.442]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:05.825]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:31:05.985 --> 01:31:11.131]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:31:11.411 --> 01:31:11.891]  That's it?
[01:31:12.132 --> 01:31:13.733]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:31:13.913 --> 01:31:14.633]  It is easy.
[01:31:14.834 --> 01:31:21.478]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:31:21.739 --> 01:31:23.080]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:24.080]  That's amazing!
[01:31:24.401 --> 01:31:29.765]  And, the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:31:30.005 --> 01:31:30.325]  Wow!
[01:31:30.505 --> 01:31:31.566]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:31:32.006 --> 01:31:35.030]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[01:31:51.325 --> 01:31:56.487]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:57.147 --> 01:31:59.508]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:31:59.528 --> 01:32:07.051]  Wanda Piety joining us in the third hour of the program today from SaveAmericaFun.com.
[01:32:07.091 --> 01:32:10.732]  They're involved with the truck-out rally in Washington coming next week.
[01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:12.533]  We'll be interested to speak with her.
[01:32:13.462 --> 01:32:24.444]  I have Alex Jones on the phone and also Andrew from Massachusetts who disagreed, I guess, with the way we're defending the right to own and carry firearms.
[01:32:24.464 --> 01:32:26.884]  Just real quick, Andrew, what would you suggest we do?
[01:32:26.944 --> 01:32:28.385]  Just not say anything at all.
[01:32:28.785 --> 01:32:30.425]  I'd like to know what you would like us to do.
[01:32:31.805 --> 01:32:42.047]  I'm uncertain if making all sorts of justifications is an effective way because when we already have a right, when you make all sorts of justifications, it makes it seem like, oh well,
[01:32:43.128 --> 01:32:53.952]  Well, I would consider it a debate and an argument, though you're saying we shouldn't even have the debate because these are God-given rights and inalienable rights, formatted, of course, in the Constitution.
[01:32:54.792 --> 01:32:56.933]  But just real quick, before I let you go, I've got to go to Alex.
[01:32:56.993 --> 01:32:57.814]  What would you do?
[01:32:57.914 --> 01:33:00.995]  Just not say anything and just say it's in the Constitution?
[01:33:01.015 --> 01:33:02.955]  Go read it?
[01:33:02.975 --> 01:33:07.357]  I would argue it on a constitutional basis, saying, gun grabbers, you can't take our rights away.
[01:33:07.397 --> 01:33:08.918]  It's afforded to us in the Constitution.
[01:33:11.007 --> 01:33:17.245]  And you do understand that they'll tell you that the militia, we no longer need a militia, it's the National Guard and we just need to hand over our guns.
[01:33:18.635 --> 01:33:20.556]  Well, there's the argument.
[01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:21.737]  We've got to have the argument.
[01:33:21.757 --> 01:33:23.378]  I appreciate what you're saying, Andrew.
[01:33:23.398 --> 01:33:24.499]  I'll ask Alex about it here.
[01:33:24.519 --> 01:33:25.199]  Thank you for the call.
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.800]  Alex Jones is with us, of course.
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:27.881]  I'm hosting his show.
[01:33:27.941 --> 01:33:29.782]  He's calling in from a remote location.
[01:33:30.443 --> 01:33:31.964]  More information about the VTech shooting.
[01:33:32.084 --> 01:33:33.084]  Alex, I mean, what do you think?
[01:33:33.104 --> 01:33:40.129]  Should we not justify, I mean, are we justifying that we have a God-given right to protect ourselves and to carry firearms?
[01:33:40.169 --> 01:33:41.930]  And we have to make the argument, don't we, Alex?
[01:33:42.751 --> 01:33:46.233]  Well, I was listening to him in the last segment and
[01:33:47.503 --> 01:33:53.968]  Really, I think he was just somebody who wanted to get to the head of the line by claiming he disagreed, because we have that rule here on my show.
[01:33:54.749 --> 01:33:56.570]  But first off, Jack, thanks for sitting in for me.
[01:33:56.850 --> 01:33:59.633]  Let me just talk about that.
[01:34:00.333 --> 01:34:05.677]  I hear people all the time say, we've proven 9-11's an inside job, let's move forward to something else now.
[01:34:06.378 --> 01:34:08.840]  Or I've heard, what does talking about it do?
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.201]  I want to see some action.
[01:34:10.861 --> 01:34:11.702]  Well, we are.
[01:34:11.782 --> 01:34:13.083]  That is the number one thing.
[01:34:13.123 --> 01:34:15.565]  That's how minds are changed, that's how societies
[01:34:16.115 --> 01:34:21.619]  are built or destroyed is on the opinion of the people that they didn't put into their daily practice and action.
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.180]  We may know.
[01:34:23.681 --> 01:34:25.582]  Let me just say, a poll just came out.
[01:34:25.863 --> 01:34:33.668]  I think according to Zogby, 58% of the people polled want us to give up our guns and want strict gun control.
[01:34:33.688 --> 01:34:35.350]  So obviously they're not educated, Alex.
[01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:36.851]  We've got to do something to educate them.
[01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:38.352]  Well that's a motion.
[01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:39.433]  The polls are showing
[01:34:40.444 --> 01:34:43.946]  You know, 60-70% pro-Second Amendment just a few months ago.
[01:34:44.826 --> 01:34:49.928]  And, of course, we have to find out who paid Zogby to do that poll and where they polled specifically.
[01:34:50.128 --> 01:34:51.489]  And it wasn't done at urban centers.
[01:34:52.469 --> 01:34:54.970]  Bottom line, that's the problem with all these illegal aliens.
[01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:56.171]  That's why I'm so upset with it.
[01:34:56.691 --> 01:34:59.132]  Because they're about to totally ban guns in L.A.
[01:34:59.632 --> 01:35:03.014]  Because as long as the government says, this is the liberal, this is the...
[01:35:03.689 --> 01:35:06.073]  Well, this is the La Reconquista thing to do.
[01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:11.081]  Well then, oh my gosh, we've got to pull the lever to hand our guns in so we can be slaves like we are in Mexico.
[01:35:12.103 --> 01:35:16.851]  Where there's total gun ban, by the way, and the military drives around with machine guns, shaking down families.
[01:35:17.392 --> 01:35:21.494]  I've seen it many times, and you see a cop, you bend down and start licking their boots, and they don't have freedom.
[01:35:22.014 --> 01:35:27.717]  That's my problem with all these people coming in from China and Mexico and Russia, is that they're accustomed to licking boots.
[01:35:28.517 --> 01:35:38.862]  And I'd be happy to have them here, number one, if they'd stop the boot licking and stop trying to bring down my free country that my forefathers fought and died for and bled for and paid for in blood and treasure.
[01:35:38.902 --> 01:35:40.482]  But let me just go back to this guy.
[01:35:41.523 --> 01:35:42.963]  And let me just explain something to him.
[01:35:45.484 --> 01:35:46.185]  They lie.
[01:35:46.265 --> 01:35:57.640]  They have the big Chicago University fellow who wrote a lie three years ago saying that no one owned guns, that 99% didn't own guns, that the founding fathers were anti-gun.
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:01.746]  Of course, professors went and did research and found out it was all total lies.
[01:36:02.706 --> 01:36:12.011]  Uh, Josh Sugarman of Handgun Control Incorporated said in the Austin American Statesman, uh, in October of 2000, I'll never forget it, he said, we are going to ban guns.
[01:36:12.472 --> 01:36:14.913]  It doesn't matter what you say or do or if it's a right or not.
[01:36:14.953 --> 01:36:17.114]  We've got your children and they will be banned.
[01:36:17.534 --> 01:36:19.255]  They're brainwashing the children right now.
[01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:25.639]  They put up these images, this total psyop of a guy pointing a gun at you, show it on TV to threaten and scare the public.
[01:36:26.283 --> 01:36:28.524]  And oh my God, the bad man's aiming a gun at me.
[01:36:28.565 --> 01:36:30.766]  Your brain sees that as the guy threatening you.
[01:36:31.266 --> 01:36:33.448]  They manipulate the cowardice in people.
[01:36:33.468 --> 01:36:34.809]  They terrorize the public.
[01:36:35.649 --> 01:36:40.692]  And yes, we have to keep restating our facts, keep restating our facts, keep restating our facts.
[01:36:41.093 --> 01:36:43.354]  That's the information war.
[01:36:43.854 --> 01:36:45.415]  That's what it's all about.
[01:36:45.876 --> 01:36:53.120]  And just because we have a God-given, inalienable, organic, common law, right.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.722]  I don't need the government to tell me I'm another man's slave.
[01:36:56.092 --> 01:37:02.914]  I don't need any government to tell me I have a right to be free and that somebody can't come grab me and my family and go stick us on a plantation.
[01:37:02.954 --> 01:37:11.257]  And I don't care if the government says I have to go to a plantation, I'm going to try to physically kill anybody who comes to make me their slave.
[01:37:11.537 --> 01:37:16.018]  Now, everybody knows in their gut you have a right and a duty to defend yourself.
[01:37:16.939 --> 01:37:23.140]  You know, if Russian paratroopers landed tomorrow and said, we're the rightful government, we know that's a fraud.
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.761]  Well, this is not our rightful government.
[01:37:25.525 --> 01:37:29.908]  You take the Mayor Daley, you know, mobster family that's run Chicago over 50 years.
[01:37:30.589 --> 01:37:32.170]  They want a total gun ban.
[01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:47.781]  Mobsters want disarmed peasants, disarmed slaves, and everyone's got to... So we can argue all day that it's a God-given right and it's in the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and we do do that, and we do point out... I mean, we have an article up today on PrisonPlanet.com
[01:37:48.601 --> 01:38:02.928]  Hypocrite Kucinich drafts legislation to ban guns, entertains the notion that bloodthirsty neo-fascists carried out 9-11, then says we should hand over our only protection against them, and I've actually got the article of what Kucinich has said.
[01:38:02.948 --> 01:38:11.612]  It says Kucinich is currently drafting legislation that would ban the purchase, sale, transfer, or possession of handguns by civilians.
[01:38:11.672 --> 01:38:17.735]  Now, when you talk to Kucinich's office, because they did put out that statement, Raw Story, and others picked it up,
[01:38:18.917 --> 01:38:20.858]  I'm sick of mayors calling us civilians.
[01:38:20.918 --> 01:38:22.199]  I'm sick of dumb cops.
[01:38:23.319 --> 01:38:27.061]  And again, if you're a good cop, I love you, but the dumb cops that call people civilians.
[01:38:27.701 --> 01:38:36.465]  Everyone in the government is civilian, who is on the civilian side of the government, who orders around the Pentagon, which is only in foreign actions.
[01:38:37.206 --> 01:38:38.986]  But see, we're under military law.
[01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:40.367]  We've gone under admiralty law.
[01:38:40.387 --> 01:38:42.428]  They're stripping out the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:38:42.941 --> 01:38:48.986]  And they've introduced this, we're the civilians, they're the officials, the authorities.
[01:38:49.086 --> 01:38:51.228]  No, you are the servants.
[01:38:51.408 --> 01:38:54.070]  You are the representatives that work for us.
[01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:57.233]  Yeah, just trust us, we're the officials and you are the serfs.
[01:38:58.654 --> 01:38:59.074]  That's right.
[01:38:59.114 --> 01:39:02.777]  Notice, folks, how they're changing the words, the semantics, the definitions.
[01:39:03.418 --> 01:39:05.299]  They're turning them all around here.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:11.905]  So, we do quote the Founding Fathers and the debates and the editorials that were posted.
[01:39:13.368 --> 01:39:16.209]  Let me just read a few of these, because they're in the article.
[01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:17.409]  We have a whole page of these.
[01:39:17.429 --> 01:39:28.253]  But Zachariah Johnson argued that the new Constitution could never result in religious persecution or other oppression because the people are not to be disarmed with their weapons.
[01:39:28.293 --> 01:39:30.253]  They are left in full possession of them.
[01:39:30.714 --> 01:39:34.095]  Roger Sherman, during the House consideration of the Militia Bill 1790,
[01:39:36.326 --> 01:39:54.183]  It says, uh, convinced to be the privilege of every citizen and of his most essential rights to bear arms and to resist every attack upon his liberty or property by whomsoever made the particular states like private citizens have a right to be armed and defend by force their rights when invaded.
[01:39:54.203 --> 01:39:56.805]  Uh, and let me read some of the more famous ones.
[01:39:57.245 --> 01:40:00.989]  No free man shall be debarred the use of arms.
[01:40:01.641 --> 01:40:04.163]  Thomas Jefferson, draft Virginia Constitution, 1776.
[01:40:04.724 --> 01:40:13.111]  But see, back then they had corporate fraud, so if you were a black slave, or about a third of the white population were actual slaves, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:13.131 --> 01:40:19.557]  By the way, they were selling German slaves up until about 1820, so I'm really getting sick of just hearing blacks talk about this.
[01:40:19.917 --> 01:40:23.140]  These were actual warrior slaves, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.122]  That's why Germans are the second biggest
[01:40:26.132 --> 01:40:27.553]  We're good to go.
[01:40:45.609 --> 01:40:47.330]  So, that's the bottom line there.
[01:40:47.431 --> 01:40:55.997]  It goes on to say, the advantage of being armed, which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, where the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
[01:40:56.378 --> 01:40:58.399]  James Madison, the Federalist Papers, number 46.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:01.722]  Look, I'm not going to read these all day.
[01:41:02.769 --> 01:41:21.260]  Uh, but the point is that it is our God-given right, but the general public has been taught to ninny and be scared to death of anybody who has a gun, and we need to go explain to people that it was gun control because no one was armed on this campus that allowed this to happen, and the government can't and won't protect you.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:25.942]  Folks, the average... Well, let's not let common sense get in the way of this.
[01:41:26.603 --> 01:41:27.043]  Exactly.
[01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:29.162]  People need to know this.
[01:41:29.642 --> 01:41:35.024]  Now you can go pull up the number, just type into Google, average time for 911 call response.
[01:41:35.524 --> 01:41:39.006]  In some cities it's 24 minutes, in some cities it's 13 minutes.
[01:41:39.406 --> 01:41:44.747]  You'll find different numbers, but generally it's more than 15 minutes for them to respond.
[01:41:45.328 --> 01:41:49.169]  Ladies and gentlemen, there have been so many 911 calls that have even gotten released.
[01:41:49.730 --> 01:41:54.973]  Where he's at the window, he's looking in, oh my God, come help me!
[01:41:55.393 --> 01:42:01.496]  There have been cases where the cops don't even show up, and they find the woman literally cut up in pieces after she was raped.
[01:42:01.736 --> 01:42:17.224]  There's other cases while the woman's being stabbed, while the person does it, the lock up your guns law, the 14 year old girl was a shooting champion, but they'd follow the law, have them all locked up in a safe, she didn't have the code, and the guy killed her two toddler
[01:42:18.374 --> 01:42:21.160]  Uh, siblings and the neighbor kids with the pitchfork, remember?
[01:42:21.829 --> 01:42:22.029]  Yes.
[01:42:22.409 --> 01:42:23.810]  I mean, there are thousands of these cases.
[01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:25.951]  Well, of course, and Katrina is one of the best cases.
[01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:28.613]  I mean, there were a lot of people down there running generators.
[01:42:28.813 --> 01:42:30.314]  They were able to subsist.
[01:42:30.374 --> 01:42:35.277]  They had prepared, you know, for something bad happening, and they rode through it.
[01:42:35.337 --> 01:42:36.998]  But many of them were targeted.
[01:42:37.038 --> 01:42:42.501]  If they hadn't had firearms, they would have been invaded by, you know, roving gangs who would have taken everything.
[01:42:42.761 --> 01:42:48.224]  And I know our listeners know this, but it's up to you listeners to write articles to post on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:42:48.244 --> 01:42:49.425]  We're posting those right now.
[01:42:49.985 --> 01:42:51.026]  JonesReport.com.
[01:42:52.482 --> 01:42:55.484]  I think we need to sick your listeners on Salon.com.
[01:42:55.524 --> 01:42:57.305]  This article is diabolical.
[01:42:57.425 --> 01:42:58.746]  Repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:42:58.766 --> 01:43:05.451]  The best way to reduce the odds of another bloodbath like the one in Virginia Tech is to amend the Constitution and abolish the right to bear arms.
[01:43:05.511 --> 01:43:07.312]  People actually fall for this, Alex.
[01:43:07.573 --> 01:43:09.394]  That's why we have to argue.
[01:43:09.434 --> 01:43:12.256]  That's why we have to make the point, going back to the caller.
[01:43:12.636 --> 01:43:16.679]  And see, the caller is saying that we shouldn't argue it.
[01:43:16.759 --> 01:43:18.901]  Well, they're not even arguing that it's a right.
[01:43:18.921 --> 01:43:20.162]  They're just saying, let's get rid of it.
[01:43:21.591 --> 01:43:25.572]  Salon's not even... I mean, they're not even debating now that it's a right.
[01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:27.713]  They're saying, yeah, it's a right, let's get rid of it.
[01:43:27.953 --> 01:43:40.556]  Well, I got news for you, Salon, and all you fake liberals who are about to take power with Hillary, who Limbaugh says is an 80% shoo-in, he won't tell you, Roger Ailes, his boss, the head of Fox News and Murdoch, are literally running her campaign.
[01:43:41.016 --> 01:43:43.577]  This is the sickeningness of bottom line.
[01:43:43.637 --> 01:43:46.378]  Mainline liberals, you better wake up and join the Constitutionalists.
[01:43:46.678 --> 01:43:47.838]  You better join Ron Paul.
[01:43:48.779 --> 01:43:50.040]  I've never trusted Kucinich.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.341]  He's a total slime ball.
[01:43:51.682 --> 01:43:53.003]  He's showing us what he is.
[01:43:53.643 --> 01:43:58.767]  And we've got to... He's a degenerate piece of filth, wanting to ban handguns.
[01:43:59.308 --> 01:44:03.952]  And what they'll do is they'll call for a complete ban on all guns in civilian hands.
[01:44:04.192 --> 01:44:09.556]  They'll have a bunch of GED troops, gang member troops like Katrina, ruling over us.
[01:44:09.696 --> 01:44:10.797]  No, no, no.
[01:44:10.937 --> 01:44:13.179]  So, bottom line,
[01:44:13.962 --> 01:44:17.064]  The government can't and won't protect you throughout history.
[01:44:17.164 --> 01:44:22.166]  Every time they take your guns, they slaughter you or enslave you at the bare minimum.
[01:44:22.787 --> 01:44:27.289]  And then they can't protect you when it comes time, and by the way, the feds did order
[01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:31.375]  And we confirmed this with Matt Kazee and others.
[01:44:31.415 --> 01:44:32.496]  We need to get an article up.
[01:44:32.516 --> 01:44:36.281]  I don't know what's going on, but the fact is that the Feds did order a stand down.
[01:44:36.301 --> 01:44:38.103]  We've confirmed that from three different sources.
[01:44:38.704 --> 01:44:40.286]  This is a massive news story.
[01:44:40.767 --> 01:44:44.772]  Again, they want a monopoly of power over you, so you cannot defend yourself.
[01:44:44.972 --> 01:44:46.294]  I cannot imagine.
[01:44:46.730 --> 01:45:05.309]  Living in New York where you've got to sleep with four or five locks on your door, knowing some crackhead can bust down your door at any moment, rape and kill your family, and you've got goon police that are totally rude to you everywhere, doubling the fines in the last year they give the general public, arresting people for no reason.
[01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:10.051]  We have a mafia government and their scumbag criminal followers feeding on us.
[01:45:10.111 --> 01:45:11.532]  Pressure from above and below.
[01:45:11.832 --> 01:45:17.875]  How dare the scum in government even try to take our guns when the filth couldn't protect the people of Virginia.
[01:45:17.995 --> 01:45:19.696]  Because, by the way, the evidence is they were behind it.
[01:45:19.876 --> 01:45:21.736]  They had to wait until those people got killed.
[01:45:21.937 --> 01:45:23.397]  They had to wait for people to bleed to death.
[01:45:23.977 --> 01:45:26.699]  That's what the four hours, 15 minutes at Columbine.
[01:45:27.059 --> 01:45:29.120]  This is done by design.
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:33.602]  That's why they had a pre-shooting there with this black operator from Afghanistan.
[01:45:34.322 --> 01:45:38.407]  You know, weird ROTC photos with a shooter.
[01:45:39.048 --> 01:45:40.229]  That needs to be looked at.
[01:45:40.369 --> 01:45:41.790]  We know he was involved.
[01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:45.935]  They were having drills two days ago with Marines running around putting guns to people's heads.
[01:45:46.235 --> 01:45:48.297]  This is a giant mind-control facility.
[01:45:48.598 --> 01:45:52.382]  I know I'm ranting here, Jack, but it's just off the charts.
[01:45:52.642 --> 01:45:55.705]  You've got a big story up at Infowars.com.
[01:45:56.245 --> 01:46:03.232]  This has to do with a security officer with a history of black op and action of officials unfathomable.
[01:46:03.632 --> 01:46:07.456]  Long-term university police officer alleges VA tech black op.
[01:46:07.476 --> 01:46:08.557]  You want to discuss that at all?
[01:46:09.244 --> 01:46:15.966]  Well sure, I need to call my webmaster over there because the headline he's got on the tile, on the link, is long time Virginia Tech security officer.
[01:46:16.366 --> 01:46:26.788]  He's a long time, and he's written major articles for major publications at major universities in Canada, and I interviewed him, what was it, back on Wednesday?
[01:46:26.808 --> 01:46:34.550]  And before I left town, and he just goes through how it's impossible, how standard default procedure
[01:46:35.342 --> 01:46:37.205]  Had to be next.
[01:46:37.325 --> 01:46:38.867]  Well, it's the same thing on 9-11.
[01:46:39.267 --> 01:46:40.810]  It's the same thing on 7-7.
[01:46:41.230 --> 01:46:43.113]  The feds were in control of that school.
[01:46:43.273 --> 01:46:46.297]  They ordered, they wait till the feds got there.
[01:46:46.337 --> 01:46:49.902]  They got there nearly two hours later, then stood around for another hour.
[01:46:51.269 --> 01:46:53.130]  Understand, folks, this guy shot two people.
[01:46:53.170 --> 01:46:54.010]  They found the bodies.
[01:46:54.350 --> 01:47:02.332]  He walked around everywhere, made 15 videos and all this stuff, mailed it to NBC.
[01:47:02.472 --> 01:47:04.993]  It got there, by the way, in record time, very suspiciously.
[01:47:06.134 --> 01:47:07.354]  All this stuff happened.
[01:47:08.394 --> 01:47:10.335]  I mean, just to even go through all the evidence.
[01:47:10.815 --> 01:47:17.777]  We've been doing this all week and running down all this evidence, but I was interested in the George French story, if you're familiar with that.
[01:47:17.797 --> 01:47:19.918]  Yeah, we've got it up here.
[01:47:21.336 --> 01:47:29.601]  On JonesReport.com, on Infowars.com, it says an eye-opening, spur-of-the-moment interview done on April 17th on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.681 --> 01:47:37.065]  Former long-term University Police Officer George French questioned why police did not immediately seal off the campus on the morning of the Virginia Tech shootings.
[01:47:37.445 --> 01:47:43.969]  French has written on the subject of school attacks in the past and possesses valuable experience and knowledge of University Police procedures and norms.
[01:47:44.469 --> 01:47:45.290]  We're good to go.
[01:48:06.078 --> 01:48:09.802]  Prince continued, but he went off campus and mailed his stuff and came back on.
[01:48:10.442 --> 01:48:18.750]  After a double homicide, when you're looking for a dangerous fellow at a farm, I find it unfathomable that a series of roadblocks weren't set up to prevent the felon from escaping.
[01:48:19.150 --> 01:48:24.695]  It's beyond belief, Prince stated, if you had a snowstorm, the whole education system can be shut down with a few phone calls.
[01:48:25.096 --> 01:48:30.781]  Maps of the Virginia Tech campus show that a series of 12 to 15 roadblocks and all that would have been needed
[01:48:31.181 --> 01:48:33.922]  And should be implemented immediately by local police in the event of a shooting.
[01:48:34.262 --> 01:48:37.783]  However, this basic standard response was not followed that morning.
[01:48:38.143 --> 01:48:51.486]  Referring to numerous American University policy procedures and handbooks that he has personally read, French explained, they have very serious plans in effect to use all county, state, and local law enforcement to come and aid the University.
[01:48:51.826 --> 01:48:56.287]  French cited another case, the Esso Massacre in Montreal,
[01:48:57.094 --> 01:49:00.798]  Uh, where officers were ordered not to intervene and told to wait outside.
[01:49:01.259 --> 01:49:02.881]  I think it was a black op then.
[01:49:03.221 --> 01:49:07.306]  In Blacksburg also, we saw police cowering and hiding.
[01:49:08.006 --> 01:49:12.752]  I'll coin this now, a black op in Blacksburg, cautioning that we can only, uh,
[01:49:15.868 --> 01:49:17.290]  Uh, you know, analyze at this point.
[01:49:17.370 --> 01:49:22.995]  French could find no logical conclusion other than deliberate inaction on the part of officials.
[01:49:23.416 --> 01:49:25.898]  We have another coordinated allowed event.
[01:49:26.198 --> 01:49:28.541]  This parallels are so common in each cases.
[01:49:28.941 --> 01:49:36.709]  You can write the script in advance of the former officer continued to say, and he did say in the interview that he believes it's a black up.
[01:49:37.483 --> 01:49:38.824]  Alright, we'll take a quick break.
[01:49:38.944 --> 01:49:40.305]  I hope you'll come back with us, Alex.
[01:49:40.345 --> 01:49:41.606]  I hope you'll all come back with us.
[01:49:41.626 --> 01:49:42.666]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:42.706 --> 01:49:44.508]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:44.548 --> 01:49:45.508]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in.
[01:49:45.548 --> 01:49:45.909]  Stay tuned.
[01:49:46.789 --> 01:49:53.434]  It's here.
[01:49:53.614 --> 01:49:58.397]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:49:58.757 --> 01:50:06.402]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:07.088 --> 01:50:14.131]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:14.551 --> 01:50:25.976]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:26.276 --> 01:50:29.758]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:30.238 --> 01:50:32.199]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:32.499 --> 01:50:36.361]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:49.685 --> 01:50:50.405]  Terrorism!
[01:50:50.586 --> 01:50:51.326]  Terrorism!

[01:51:02.472 --> 01:51:17.041]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:51:17.081 --> 01:51:17.381]  government.

[01:51:55.272 --> 01:52:04.201]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:04.361 --> 01:52:09.206]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:09.446 --> 01:52:18.493]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:52:53.075 --> 01:52:58.919]  We have some great footage from Willie Nelson up at Camp Casey.
[01:52:58.959 --> 01:53:03.142]  He was honored there just a few days ago.
[01:53:03.162 --> 01:53:07.245]  We'll try to fit that in sometime during the day today.
[01:53:19.433 --> 01:53:20.974]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:53:21.074 --> 01:53:21.954]  Alex is on the line.
[01:53:22.034 --> 01:53:25.955]  We've got so much information here, I don't even know if we'll have time to get it all out.
[01:53:25.995 --> 01:53:33.458]  But we do have Matt Kazee, live from the Virginia Tech area, Virginia Tech compound, who's kept us briefed on all of this information.
[01:53:33.478 --> 01:53:34.878]  We want to go to you now, Matt.
[01:53:34.918 --> 01:53:36.239]  Thank you for calling into the show.
[01:53:36.739 --> 01:53:37.579]  What do you have for us?
[01:53:37.639 --> 01:53:38.299]  Any breaking news?
[01:53:38.339 --> 01:53:39.019]  Any updates?
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:40.240]  Anything you want to run over?
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.160]  Sure.
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:42.561]  Hey Jack, it's good to talk to you.
[01:53:42.641 --> 01:53:46.882]  Yeah, actually I'm driving down the road right now, so my cell phone may be going in and out a little bit.
[01:53:47.814 --> 01:54:12.491]  I just wanted to say that the last thing that I heard was that it may not have been the president of the school, that he may have even been out of the office, and that it was the local Blacksburg City police chief who may have been going from the orders from somebody else not to alert the school because of fear of mass panic, and I quote, that they thought it was a domestic dispute and the guy had left
[01:54:12.850 --> 01:54:17.411]  The area possibly heading out of state, which is just absolutely ridiculous.
[01:54:17.451 --> 01:54:21.232]  Just to assume the best and not the worst, again, is not the procedure.
[01:54:21.632 --> 01:54:22.433]  Alex, you want to comment on that?
[01:54:23.053 --> 01:54:28.534]  Well, Matt, I've received one phone call from another EMT worker.
[01:54:28.614 --> 01:54:32.175]  You on record talked to one at the local bar and talked to other locals.
[01:54:33.116 --> 01:54:41.298]  We've also had several other calls and emails, more than several, saying the same thing, that because of the last shooting there last year,
[01:54:42.367 --> 01:54:50.378]  Concerning one of the former ROTC individuals brothers who had come back from Afghanistan and that whole manhunt
[01:54:50.976 --> 01:55:02.218]  That this school had gone under, you know, basically federal advisement or, you know, where the feds come in with a plan and that the feds had ordered them to wait until they got there.
[01:55:03.018 --> 01:55:04.539]  That is such a huge story.
[01:55:04.579 --> 01:55:06.099]  We need to get one up on that.
[01:55:06.119 --> 01:55:08.880]  Do you have anything else for us in that area?
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:20.562]  Okay, Alex, the first time I ever called your show was a while back, a year and a half, possibly two years ago, because they were role-playing drills on campus trying to
[01:55:21.075 --> 01:55:33.966]  Basically, taking people in white t-shirts and backpacks and running them down the street, hitting them with billy clubs and putting them into cars and taking them off while the students are, while the people in the white t-shirts are screaming, I'm a student, I'm an American!
[01:55:35.287 --> 01:55:38.410]  Sounds like one of your police state videos, yeah.
[01:55:38.971 --> 01:55:41.233]  I have the very same thing in my police state videos.
[01:55:41.273 --> 01:55:42.834]  Again, this is martial law training.
[01:55:43.294 --> 01:55:48.239]  What do you know about the photo, and it's clearly the shooter,
[01:55:48.797 --> 01:55:59.140]  With a Caucasian in Marine Corps Black Op uniforms with the mask on because we've gotten reports that he was somehow involved with ROTC.
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:05.681]  We know that the SWAT teams did drills the week before at that very compound dorm where the shootings happened.
[01:56:06.042 --> 01:56:07.362]  What do we know about this photo, Matt?
[01:56:08.247 --> 01:56:10.089]  You know, Alex, let me at least tell you this.
[01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:31.968]  There were drills just the other day, the same role-playing drills, three people running from campus down the middle of Turner Street, one of them in a white t-shirt and a bag, while two Marine Corps people were running behind him with earpieces, like earpiece walkie-talkies, running up and hitting him with their shoulder, running down the middle of the street.
[01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:34.000]  Multiple people saw this.
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:37.023]  I ran and alerted the authorities who didn't know anything about it.
[01:56:37.444 --> 01:56:42.149]  I ran straight to the grill field and warned every press I possibly could.
[01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:43.150]  They said they'd look into it.
[01:56:43.190 --> 01:56:45.652]  The National Press Desk gave me a call.
[01:56:45.672 --> 01:56:51.979]  They got my name, my information, and I guarantee you they Googled my name and they didn't call back after that.
[01:56:53.334 --> 01:56:55.856]  Well, we've got a huge black op going on here.
[01:56:56.236 --> 01:57:00.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've never seen more stars line up, you know, more indicators of mind control.
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:06.984]  How have we figured out who the second person is in this photo where he's wearing the marine fatigues and posing with the mask?
[01:57:07.405 --> 01:57:09.967]  Look, there's no doubt he was in some type of secret op.
[01:57:09.987 --> 01:57:12.689]  We know Langley CIA is involved heavily at the school.
[01:57:13.289 --> 01:57:13.990]  It's a black op.
[01:57:14.010 --> 01:57:15.451]  There's absolutely no debating.
[01:57:15.611 --> 01:57:19.594]  I want to carry Matt Kazee over for at least one more segment if you can do it.
[01:57:19.614 --> 01:57:20.975]  Matt, Alex, did you want to stay with us?
[01:57:21.255 --> 01:57:23.416]  Yes, and I want an article out from my writers.
[01:57:23.456 --> 01:57:24.516]  We need it out now.
[01:57:24.656 --> 01:57:27.438]  This is the key, what we're hearing right now.
[01:57:27.458 --> 01:57:29.818]  We'll come right back, third hour, on the Alex Jones Show, right after this.
[01:57:29.858 --> 01:57:34.460]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:34.921]  Big Brother.
[01:57:34.941 --> 01:57:35.321]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:49.091 --> 01:57:50.192]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:50.852 --> 01:57:51.673]  You want answers?
[01:57:52.413 --> 01:57:53.294]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.314 --> 01:57:57.637]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.177 --> 01:58:02.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.169 --> 01:58:09.250]  We are live this 20th day of April, 2007.
[01:58:09.330 --> 01:58:11.710]  Third hour of the Alex Jones Show coming your way.
[01:58:11.770 --> 01:58:13.731]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.831 --> 01:58:16.571]  Alex is on the line with us, as well as Matt Kazee.
[01:58:17.031 --> 01:58:20.872]  We'll also have a guest on talking about this truck out here in just a bit.
[01:58:20.892 --> 01:58:25.213]  And then we'll go to your call, so please hang with us at 800-259-9231.
[01:58:25.253 --> 01:58:32.294]  We still have a ton of information to go through, including some breaking news, some new revelations on what Ismail
[01:58:33.094 --> 01:58:37.755]  Might have meant and we've got a lot of information to depart for you on that as well.
[01:58:38.036 --> 01:58:43.177]  Going back to Alex Jones, Alex, it's great that you have listeners at Virginia Tech and I have listeners there.
[01:58:43.237 --> 01:58:52.080]  In fact, one sent me the emails, the series of emails that they got on the ground there, so we were able to kind of decode exactly what the timelines really were here.
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.620]  So they've been a real asset to us, Alex, over there.
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:56.001]  Absolutely.
[01:58:56.041 --> 01:59:00.482]  Day one, Matt sent me those back on Monday and we've had a lot of listeners.
[01:59:01.302 --> 01:59:02.143]  Yes, we are.
[01:59:15.535 --> 01:59:16.336]  Brief, Matt.
[01:59:16.796 --> 01:59:18.577]  Matt, Paul Watson's listening right now.
[01:59:19.117 --> 01:59:23.179]  Explain to him what you heard about the feds ordering the stand-down.
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:28.382]  Any other facets, the people running, I'm a student, I have rights, no, no, help me.
[01:59:29.103 --> 01:59:32.525]  I have videotaped this at Marine Corps concentration camp drills.
[01:59:32.985 --> 01:59:33.966]  It's in Police State 2000.
[01:59:34.746 --> 01:59:36.707]  I've also taken 35mm photos.
[01:59:36.787 --> 01:59:38.068]  It was Urban Warrior 99.
[01:59:38.688 --> 01:59:40.710]  Folks, I'm telling you, they ran the black op.
[01:59:41.170 --> 01:59:41.430]  All the
[01:59:42.259 --> 01:59:50.545]  All the indicators are out of that Marine Corps ROTC and of course the cops and of course everyone have been told let them do whatever they want.
[01:59:50.865 --> 01:59:54.688]  In fact, Matt, a few days ago you called me on Wednesday, remember?
[01:59:54.928 --> 01:59:58.450]  And you said that you walked up to the police and you said, look at this, what are they doing?
[01:59:58.470 --> 02:00:00.532]  And he just said, oh, they're just having fun.
[02:00:00.572 --> 02:00:01.953]  Or what did you say exactly?
[02:00:02.706 --> 02:00:07.610]  I've actually got video of that, Alex, and he said, oh, well, if it's the Marine Corps, they've got it under control.
[02:00:07.650 --> 02:00:09.131]  They're probably just horsing around.
[02:00:09.551 --> 02:00:11.373]  At which point I said, horsing around?
[02:00:11.393 --> 02:00:13.074]  I know they weren't horsing around!
[02:00:13.594 --> 02:00:14.976]  And, I mean, what a great day to horse around!
[02:00:14.996 --> 02:00:16.617]  Okay, Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt, you've got it.
[02:00:16.717 --> 02:00:17.658]  Is that video up yet?
[02:00:18.898 --> 02:00:21.741]  I believe it is posted at thetruthmovement.net.
[02:00:22.685 --> 02:00:23.146]  Okay, yeah.
[02:00:23.186 --> 02:00:27.010]  Paul Watson told me he's seen video of you two giving testimony.
[02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:29.933]  See, because I'm supposed to be on vacation, I'm really working the whole time.
[02:00:30.333 --> 02:00:34.658]  Supposedly, you know, you're giving your video testimony about the federal stand-down.
[02:00:34.698 --> 02:00:35.479]  That is huge.
[02:00:35.959 --> 02:00:39.263]  Bottom line, here's the headline, we've got to get it out to everybody.
[02:00:39.983 --> 02:00:42.486]  Emergency workers slash
[02:00:45.083 --> 02:00:47.204]  Feds ordered Virginia Tech stand down.
[02:00:47.504 --> 02:00:54.586]  Marines engage in bizarre black ops, bizarre activities, shooter in Marine uniform.
[02:00:54.866 --> 02:00:59.228]  They need to be in that Marine Corps facility ripping that place apart, but they won't.
[02:00:59.428 --> 02:01:02.029]  I'm telling you, it's coming out of that Marine Corps base.
[02:01:02.189 --> 02:01:02.729]  Guaranteed.
[02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:08.271]  Just like, remember Charles Whitman, the Marine, and I've done studies on him out of Austin, Texas.
[02:01:08.331 --> 02:01:09.311]  I have family that knew him.
[02:01:09.671 --> 02:01:10.732]  Total black ops.
[02:01:10.992 --> 02:01:15.194]  He gets out of the Marine Corps, goes into black ops, goes crazy and starts shooting everybody.
[02:01:15.415 --> 02:01:17.396]  They've passed national gun control laws.
[02:01:17.776 --> 02:01:22.739]  I am sick of the brainwashing and the mind control going on inside the military.
[02:01:23.099 --> 02:01:29.003]  Back in the 50s, it was the Marines with the CIA that pioneered drugging and brainwashing.
[02:01:29.323 --> 02:01:30.824]  I mean, Jack, this is looking bad, isn't it?
[02:01:31.622 --> 02:01:38.883]  I mean, I think it's undeniable, and you know, we've gotten certainly a lot of heat because, of course, you know, everything we report is a conspiracy.
[02:01:38.904 --> 02:01:39.964]  Well, that's what we do.
[02:01:40.024 --> 02:01:47.605]  We investigate the things here on this network that don't add up, and that's why we talk about these things, because there are conspiracies.
[02:01:47.665 --> 02:01:49.046]  Conspiracies do exist.
[02:01:49.246 --> 02:01:50.426]  There are black ops.
[02:01:50.466 --> 02:01:53.927]  There is psychological operations going forward throughout the world.
[02:01:53.947 --> 02:01:56.607]  There's a history of this, and we've got to point it out.
[02:01:56.687 --> 02:01:59.068]  So, yes, the things we point out are conspiracies.
[02:01:59.128 --> 02:02:01.048]  That's what we focus on, Alex.
[02:02:01.954 --> 02:02:04.395]  Folks, just support our operation and what we're doing.
[02:02:04.435 --> 02:02:08.136]  Go to the website, get the films, get the books, get the materials at InfoWars.com.
[02:02:08.176 --> 02:02:11.577]  I'm going to get out of here, Jack, but Matt, let's push that guest back ten minutes.
[02:02:11.617 --> 02:02:14.537]  I know she's very important in the trucking rally to beat the Mexican President.
[02:02:14.557 --> 02:02:16.898]  We'll try to do that, and Matt, if you can hang on as well.
[02:02:16.918 --> 02:02:17.598]  I will.
[02:02:18.078 --> 02:02:20.019]  And I guess I'll be back in for you on Monday.
[02:02:20.039 --> 02:02:21.639]  Alex, I hope you get some rest.
[02:02:21.879 --> 02:02:24.920]  This is a hard time to take a vacation.
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:26.881]  I've got to go do some business, but I'll be back on Tuesday.
[02:02:27.121 --> 02:02:27.781]  God bless you guys.
[02:02:28.121 --> 02:02:28.943]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:02:29.163 --> 02:02:33.872]  We'll come back with Matt Kazee and then we'll also be joined by our guest here very shortly talking about the truck out.
[02:02:33.912 --> 02:02:36.056]  We'll go back to more information and we'll take your calls.
[02:02:36.076 --> 02:02:37.258]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:37.278 --> 02:02:39.021]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:02:39.041 --> 02:02:39.382]  Stay tuned.
[02:02:41.849 --> 02:02:42.630]  Terrorism!
[02:02:42.770 --> 02:02:43.530]  Terrorism!
[02:02:43.630 --> 02:02:49.695]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:02:49.955 --> 02:02:51.536]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:02:51.796 --> 02:02:54.258]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:02:54.658 --> 02:03:09.228]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:03:09.268 --> 02:03:09.569]  government.
[02:03:09.749 --> 02:03:11.550]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:03:11.930 --> 02:03:17.835]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:03:17.955 --> 02:03:22.479]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:03:44.298 --> 02:03:49.785]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:50.146 --> 02:03:57.756]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:58.487 --> 02:04:05.531]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:05.931 --> 02:04:17.377]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:17.677 --> 02:04:21.339]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:23.581]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:23.901 --> 02:04:27.743]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:41.158 --> 02:04:45.441]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:04:45.681 --> 02:04:50.525]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:50.785 --> 02:04:52.146]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[02:05:42.928 --> 02:05:48.953]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:49.573 --> 02:05:52.556]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.979 --> 02:06:03.567]  We just backed up Wanda Piety, another segment, and we'll be talking about the truck-out, the big labor protests.
[02:06:04.327 --> 02:06:08.932]  That's right, to protest the coming North American Union and the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:06:10.312 --> 02:06:13.376]  As well as the North American Corridor, everything that goes with it.
[02:06:13.396 --> 02:06:15.698]  So we'll talk to Wanda here in just a few minutes.
[02:06:15.738 --> 02:06:17.680]  Right now we've got Matt Kazee on the phone.
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:19.122]  We'll also take some of your calls.
[02:06:19.903 --> 02:06:26.450]  Matt, I'd like you to put out your website because you do good work as well and I think you should get credit for that if you could tell people where to find you.
[02:06:27.145 --> 02:06:31.088]  Sure, this is the TruthMovement.net.
[02:06:31.508 --> 02:06:33.410]  The TruthMovement.net.
[02:06:33.730 --> 02:06:48.841]  And if you could repeat for us what you said off the air about ROTC being armed, potentially stopping this event from going forward and happening, and then again the logistics of the bomb threat prior, and then of course this shooting just then thereafter.
[02:06:48.881 --> 02:06:50.022]  If you could run that down for us.
[02:06:50.442 --> 02:06:50.883]  Absolutely.
[02:06:50.923 --> 02:06:53.765]  Well, Virginia Tech is a quasi-military school anyway.
[02:06:53.845 --> 02:06:55.426]  I mean, there's a large presence
[02:06:55.825 --> 02:06:59.173]  of ROTC and I happen to know a lot of these kids and I can assure you
[02:06:59.727 --> 02:07:06.531]  That if ROTC had allowed to be armed with concealed carry permits, they would have stopped this thing in a few minutes.
[02:07:06.671 --> 02:07:13.635]  I can assure you that the local police were on top of this, and they got sent on a wild goose chase from building to building.
[02:07:13.675 --> 02:07:19.118]  That's why they keep showing that cop running, that big cop running across the campus.
[02:07:19.138 --> 02:07:29.024]  It's because these people didn't know where it was until the last shot started firing, because they were getting reports of bomb threats in various buildings, and they were running from building to building.
[02:07:29.544 --> 02:07:30.165]  I don't know.
[02:07:51.066 --> 02:07:55.649]  They wanted to protect their students and themselves after the Morva killings the first day of school.
[02:07:56.090 --> 02:07:58.031]  I'm sure those professors are pretty upset too.
[02:07:58.371 --> 02:08:00.573]  I'm very glad that an EMT person called Alex.
[02:08:00.873 --> 02:08:05.956]  I don't know if it's the same one that I talked to, but I'd say that there are several who know about this and there are several who will come forward.
[02:08:06.316 --> 02:08:09.378]  The bomb threat started Monday before the Friday the 13th.
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:12.260]  There were bomb threats that day.
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:14.702]  A lot of the police showed up.
[02:08:15.142 --> 02:08:19.465]  Friday the 13th they had the biggest bomb threat and the entire SWAT showed up.
[02:08:19.726 --> 02:08:20.786]  They stayed for eight hours.
[02:08:21.087 --> 02:08:27.191]  These bomb threats happened at the three buildings surrounding where this final shoot down happened.
[02:08:27.631 --> 02:08:34.436]  And they had cleared the entire area and had gone through every one of those buildings on Friday.
[02:08:34.984 --> 02:08:56.899]  I mean common sense would tell us number one they know where the shooter might be heading again getting these early bomb threats this is an early indicator maybe a potentially even prior knowledge but I mean even after all of that and you guys had a shooting the month before I mean why and you made this point earlier why just assume the best why just assume that this is a domestic shooting and everything's handled and
[02:08:57.299 --> 02:09:03.087]  Don't take any precautionary measures when everything told you to expect the worst.
[02:09:03.267 --> 02:09:05.870]  And this, of course, again, is police procedure.
[02:09:06.030 --> 02:09:08.273]  Always plan for the worst.
[02:09:08.353 --> 02:09:09.615]  And they did not do that.
[02:09:09.635 --> 02:09:11.117]  And I think that's extremely damning, Matt.
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:18.102]  Well, I mean, the bottom line is, even if it was a domestic dispute killing, it was inside a dorm room.
[02:09:18.122 --> 02:09:19.202]  You have to understand something.
[02:09:19.502 --> 02:09:28.665]  Will Morva shot that cop the next morning on the Huckleberry Trail, miles away, and they canceled classes, they cleared buildings instantly.
[02:09:29.167 --> 02:09:30.927]  Now, it just did not happen here.
[02:09:30.967 --> 02:09:32.288]  They were trying to keep it quiet.
[02:09:32.608 --> 02:09:44.631]  Now, the last thing I heard was that the President may have been out of his office, and they couldn't get a hold of him, and it was a local police taking a federal order to maybe hold off, so that there wouldn't be mass panic.
[02:09:44.711 --> 02:09:45.611]  That's ridiculous!
[02:09:45.671 --> 02:09:49.812]  I can assure you, when the loudspeakers went off at 9.50, there was mass panic.
[02:09:49.832 --> 02:09:52.872]  Yeah, and even when the second round or third round of email went out.
[02:09:53.012 --> 02:09:54.673]  Oh, you could hear the gunshots all over town.
[02:09:54.933 --> 02:09:55.093]  Yeah.
[02:09:56.252 --> 02:09:58.514]  Well, keep us posted if you would, Matt.
[02:09:58.594 --> 02:10:05.181]  Any new information you come up with, when you come up with it, call in either to this show or to my show and we'd love to, you know, have you.
[02:10:05.241 --> 02:10:11.006]  In fact, I'm really proud of you for staying on top of this and having the information, getting the information you do, being on the ground.
[02:10:11.046 --> 02:10:12.568]  It's an important piece of the puzzle.
[02:10:13.349 --> 02:10:14.490]  Stay safe, okay buddy?
[02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:15.811]  Alright, take care, Jack.
[02:10:15.851 --> 02:10:16.731]  Appreciate the call.
[02:10:17.312 --> 02:10:18.412]  Let's just go right to the phones.
[02:10:18.432 --> 02:10:21.694]  We have a few minutes left in this segment, and we'll put our ear to the ground.
[02:10:21.714 --> 02:10:26.077]  I'll go to Irene in Minnesota, who's been holding for quite some time.
[02:10:26.117 --> 02:10:29.619]  Irene, did you want to comment on the VTEC shooting, or did you want to bring up something else?
[02:10:29.639 --> 02:10:30.079]  You're on the air.
[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:31.100]  Hi.
[02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:41.066]  Actually, somewhat related to the VTEC shooting is about an hour and a half ago, I had to go pick my daughter up from her middle school because there was a bomb threat there.
[02:10:41.446 --> 02:10:42.267]  Unbelievable!
[02:10:42.327 --> 02:10:44.388]  We just reported at the top of the show that
[02:10:45.474 --> 02:10:51.497]  Upwards to 30 schools were closed in Northern California, also due to shooting threats and bomb threats.
[02:10:51.537 --> 02:10:54.179]  We had, of course, this happen right here in Austin, Texas with St.
[02:10:54.239 --> 02:10:54.579]  Edwards.
[02:10:54.799 --> 02:10:58.461]  And you're saying that your school in Minnesota was closed under bomb threats as well?
[02:10:58.941 --> 02:11:05.444]  Yeah, well my daughter said that they had announced that all the kids needed to go to the gym.
[02:11:06.425 --> 02:11:08.206]  All students and teachers needed to go to the gym.
[02:11:08.766 --> 02:11:11.667]  And they locked down the kids in the gym.
[02:11:11.687 --> 02:11:14.729]  They pulled down all the metal shutters because they've got a lot of windows there.
[02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:19.252]  Can you tell us what the school was?
[02:11:19.752 --> 02:11:23.777]  It's a middle school.
[02:11:24.137 --> 02:11:25.239]  Pioneer Middle School.
[02:11:25.279 --> 02:11:27.942]  Were you allowed to come and pick up your child?
[02:11:27.962 --> 02:11:28.963]  Were you alerted to this?
[02:11:30.487 --> 02:11:31.287]  So you were allowed?
[02:11:31.707 --> 02:11:36.729]  Yeah, she actually called us from a friend's cell phone when she was in the gym to let us know what was going on.
[02:11:36.789 --> 02:11:45.172]  Evidently, a friend of hers actually found this note in the bathroom and took it in to let the teachers know.
[02:11:46.071 --> 02:11:52.052]  And that's when they gathered all the kids together and took them into the... Seems like it might have been a false alarm, another hoax.
[02:11:52.092 --> 02:11:55.613]  You know, we have a middle school down here in Austin, Texas.
[02:11:55.913 --> 02:11:57.713]  One of my friend's children go there.
[02:11:58.034 --> 02:12:03.935]  I believe, and they can call me and correct me on this, I believe they had something like five bomb threats in one month.
[02:12:04.635 --> 02:12:05.975]  Just something crazy like this.
[02:12:05.995 --> 02:12:08.876]  So this isn't new, but we're certainly seeing a lot more of this.
[02:12:09.116 --> 02:12:14.057]  Do you intend to put your child back into a public school when they cannot protect them?
[02:12:14.577 --> 02:12:19.021]  Well, that is a big concern, you know.
[02:12:19.201 --> 02:12:31.010]  And the thing that was really funny is my daughter and my husband and myself, we talked about it, and she said she thought it was really frightening for her because they locked them into this gym during a bomb threat.
[02:12:31.090 --> 02:12:34.812]  And what she was worried about, it was, you know, it's a bomb threat.
[02:12:35.373 --> 02:12:36.714]  The building's going to get blown up.
[02:12:37.242 --> 02:12:38.042]  She's going to be in it.
[02:12:38.182 --> 02:12:38.683]  You know how?
[02:12:38.843 --> 02:12:39.523]  Unbelievable.
[02:12:40.143 --> 02:12:41.624]  So you've got to kind of question that.
[02:12:41.684 --> 02:12:45.885]  Almost as if they knew that it was a hoax and they were just running the children through the routine.
[02:12:46.245 --> 02:12:49.827]  Yeah, either that or they got more information or something and she mentioned that...
[02:12:51.314 --> 02:12:55.778]  The day before, there was some rumor going around that some kids were talking about doing something.
[02:12:56.138 --> 02:12:58.841]  You know, I just wouldn't put my child in public school.
[02:12:58.861 --> 02:13:06.507]  That's just my own opinion, and if I did, I would make sure to have all the answers I need before I let them go back into that school.
[02:13:07.408 --> 02:13:09.249]  That's a very traumatizing event.
[02:13:09.289 --> 02:13:10.330]  I hope you guys are okay.
[02:13:10.591 --> 02:13:11.751]  Irene, thank you for the report.
[02:13:12.072 --> 02:13:12.712]  I appreciate it.
[02:13:12.732 --> 02:13:14.454]  Let's go to Rich in Pennsylvania.
[02:13:14.734 --> 02:13:15.435]  Rich, are you with us?
[02:13:15.455 --> 02:13:17.036]  You're on the Alex Jones Program.
[02:13:17.722 --> 02:13:19.464]  Oh yeah, I've been here for about an hour now.
[02:13:19.524 --> 02:13:20.444]  Well, I just wanted to check.
[02:13:20.485 --> 02:13:21.605]  Thank you very much for holding.
[02:13:22.126 --> 02:13:22.686]  No problem.
[02:13:22.867 --> 02:13:25.169]  I just wanted to talk about this gun control thing.
[02:13:25.349 --> 02:13:26.870]  It's actually preposterous, you know.
[02:13:26.890 --> 02:13:29.492]  I mean, the government's implementing all these new laws.
[02:13:29.552 --> 02:13:32.075]  I mean, the Second Amendment shall not be questioned.
[02:13:32.455 --> 02:13:33.896]  It shall not be infringed.
[02:13:33.916 --> 02:13:37.860]  You know, they really are trying to take our guns and they come up with these black operations.
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:39.321]  It's just pathetic.
[02:13:39.521 --> 02:13:42.305]  All these liberal yuppies are just like, oh no, guns are bad.
[02:13:53.217 --> 02:14:02.342]  I don't think it was ambiguous.
[02:14:02.402 --> 02:14:07.524]  I think it said just what it said, and I know why it said it, so I don't know why we have to question this.
[02:14:07.544 --> 02:14:09.045]  This is a constitutional amendment.
[02:14:09.265 --> 02:14:18.050]  I mean, let's have a con-con, and let's figure out a way to get Arnold Schwarzenegger, das Gruppenfuhrer, elected president, and then let's just ban guns while we do it.
[02:14:18.690 --> 02:14:19.391]  I don't think so.
[02:14:19.471 --> 02:14:22.613]  What we'll have then is another cold April 19th morning of 1775.
[02:14:22.693 --> 02:14:23.174]  Guaranteed.
[02:14:23.414 --> 02:14:26.897]  At least up here in Pennsylvania anyway.
[02:14:26.917 --> 02:14:31.781]  There's a lot of gun boys out here that are not... You guys are in big trouble in Pennsylvania.
[02:14:31.841 --> 02:14:32.822]  I hope you're fighting back.
[02:14:33.442 --> 02:14:34.022]  I'll tell you what.
[02:14:34.043 --> 02:14:37.525]  When government people come up here in Pennsylvania, it's going to be on.
[02:14:37.906 --> 02:14:39.207]  They're going to get our guns, sure.
[02:14:39.247 --> 02:14:40.227]  West Virginia style.
[02:14:40.287 --> 02:14:40.988]  Barrel first.
[02:14:41.408 --> 02:14:47.053]  Of course you heard that Tom Ridge is going to be sitting on the committee that's going to be investigating this entire VTEC shooting.
[02:14:47.972 --> 02:14:48.932]  Yeah, obviously.
[02:14:49.172 --> 02:14:50.032]  He knows what he's doing.
[02:14:50.573 --> 02:14:51.633]  Like all the rest of them do.
[02:14:52.433 --> 02:14:53.633]  They know what's good for us.
[02:14:53.893 --> 02:14:55.293]  Yeah, okay.
[02:14:55.373 --> 02:14:58.394]  I think he's the one that said duct tape and plastic.
[02:14:58.414 --> 02:15:00.655]  That will be helping us if the terrorists attack us.
[02:15:00.715 --> 02:15:03.975]  But he was, of course, your governor up there.
[02:15:04.255 --> 02:15:05.275]  Thanks for the call, Rich.
[02:15:05.315 --> 02:15:06.096]  I really appreciate it.
[02:15:06.136 --> 02:15:06.876]  Have a great weekend.
[02:15:06.896 --> 02:15:07.956]  Let's go to John in New York.
[02:15:07.996 --> 02:15:08.896]  John, thank you for holding.
[02:15:08.916 --> 02:15:09.996]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:10.256 --> 02:15:10.717]  Am I on?
[02:15:10.957 --> 02:15:11.597]  You are on.
[02:15:11.937 --> 02:15:13.097]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:15:13.157 --> 02:15:13.537]  You got it.
[02:15:13.817 --> 02:15:15.758]  I have two quick comments to make.
[02:15:16.178 --> 02:15:17.598]  Both of them concern firearms.
[02:15:18.337 --> 02:15:32.940]  Uh, the first thing I want to say is to all the people out there who claim that they're going to resist, uh, the tyranny with firearms, you better make sure you got lots of ammo, lots of food, lots of water, lots of web gear, good boots, camo,
[02:15:33.644 --> 02:15:36.585]  And all kinds of other stuff to go with all your chutzpah.
[02:15:36.845 --> 02:15:45.267]  Yeah, like I said, I saw Red Dawn again last night with Charlie Sheen, and, uh, that day really reminded me of kind of the circumstances that we're in.
[02:15:45.487 --> 02:15:49.028]  Unfortunately, the timing was very strange to see that, but go ahead.
[02:15:49.488 --> 02:15:55.350]  If you're not prepared, you've got a couple hundred rounds stuck away with a hunting rifle or a shotgun, you're not in the game.
[02:15:55.410 --> 02:15:56.350]  That's real simple.
[02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:59.111]  You've got to have thousands of rounds of ammunition.
[02:15:59.631 --> 02:16:02.332]  The second point I want to make is about the Second Amendment.
[02:16:02.935 --> 02:16:15.667]  The simplest way that I have found to address a dialogue with another individual about what the Second Amendment means is to just ask them if they took high school English.
[02:16:16.368 --> 02:16:23.355]  And when they very surprisingly, well of course I took high school English, well then ask them to conjugate
[02:16:24.133 --> 02:16:32.859]  The Second Amendment, because it's only one sentence, and the subject is the right prepositional phrase of the people.
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:35.080]  It's very simple.
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:44.767]  All the other stuff is just added on, explanation-type stuff in the sentence, and it's real simple to do when you do it like that.
[02:16:45.387 --> 02:16:45.647]  All right.
[02:16:45.707 --> 02:16:46.388]  Very good call.
[02:16:46.408 --> 02:16:47.128]  Thank you for the call.
[02:16:47.148 --> 02:16:47.709]  Appreciate it.
[02:16:47.749 --> 02:16:49.250]  Let's go to Fred in Maryland.
[02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:50.390]  Fred, thank you for holding.
[02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:51.691]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:52.272 --> 02:16:52.932]  Hello.
[02:16:53.479 --> 02:17:05.126]  Thank you, um, I just wanted to say that, I mean, they're going to continue to do these different things, like, like the 9-11 hoax and all of the, the hoopla of I.R.M.I.S.
[02:17:05.146 --> 02:17:13.210]  to be able to cut out freedom of speech, as well as this shooting, they're going to use that to take out the, take out our, um, Second Amendment rights.
[02:17:13.731 --> 02:17:19.214]  But also, I wanted to say, a lot of this stuff is calculated, and I expect to see a lot more if we don't
[02:17:19.901 --> 02:17:22.764]  Continue to speak up, and if we do continue to speak up, they'll let us go.
[02:17:22.824 --> 02:17:29.390]  And also, I wanted to say that 9-11, the towers were actually built on August 7, 1968.
[02:17:29.970 --> 02:17:32.733]  They went down on September 11, 2001.
[02:17:32.833 --> 02:17:36.656]  That is exactly 33 years and 33 days.
[02:17:36.677 --> 02:17:37.898]  There you go.
[02:17:37.918 --> 02:17:38.378]  There's another 33.
[02:17:38.718 --> 02:17:39.619]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:39.839 --> 02:17:41.000]  We'll come right back with our guest.

[02:17:54.827 --> 02:17:58.509]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:17:58.789 --> 02:18:02.991]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:18:03.271 --> 02:18:07.213]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:18:07.433 --> 02:18:13.957]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:18:14.197 --> 02:18:19.680]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:24.502]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[02:18:24.742 --> 02:18:26.845]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:18:26.905 --> 02:18:28.887]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[02:18:28.947 --> 02:18:29.588]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:18:41.585 --> 02:18:47.790]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:48.250 --> 02:18:56.016]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:18:56.377 --> 02:19:04.223]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:04.523 --> 02:19:09.286]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:09.626 --> 02:19:14.328]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:19:14.829 --> 02:19:18.691]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartels.
[02:19:19.031 --> 02:19:20.212]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:19:41.303 --> 02:19:43.024]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:19:43.184 --> 02:19:44.444]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:44.664 --> 02:19:47.485]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:47.865 --> 02:19:50.606]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:19:51.166 --> 02:19:57.868]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:20:40.519 --> 02:20:44.101]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:20:44.362 --> 02:20:45.222]  Look no further!
[02:20:45.522 --> 02:20:48.084]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.

[02:21:14.704 --> 02:21:15.044]  I don't know.
[02:21:42.146 --> 02:21:50.973]  While you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[02:21:59.768 --> 02:22:03.130]  The place is where you used to play.
[02:22:03.210 --> 02:22:09.694]  It was an inside job, kind of well-conditioned.
[02:22:11.175 --> 02:22:16.478]  You're a little frozen, so merrily rejected.
[02:22:17.978 --> 02:22:18.738]  Thanks for tuning in, folks.
[02:22:18.858 --> 02:22:23.640]  It is the Genesis Communications Radio Network, your first source for alternative news.
[02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:25.281]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:25.341 --> 02:22:27.521]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[02:22:28.182 --> 02:22:35.124]  Make sure to go check out the headlines at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and do what you can to fight that Infowar.
[02:22:35.424 --> 02:22:37.085]  Joining us now is Wanda Piety.
[02:22:37.145 --> 02:22:40.026]  She is with the SaveAmericaFund.com.
[02:22:40.066 --> 02:22:40.446]  They are
[02:22:40.826 --> 02:22:47.311]  One of many who are alerting people to the truckers rally, to the truck out coming up here in just a few days.
[02:22:47.391 --> 02:22:48.412]  I welcome her to the program.
[02:22:48.452 --> 02:22:49.513]  Wanda, thank you for joining us.
[02:22:50.094 --> 02:22:50.694]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:50.774 --> 02:22:52.155]  Thanks for having me on your show.
[02:22:52.335 --> 02:22:54.337]  I'm Jack and I'm sitting in for Alex today.
[02:22:54.677 --> 02:22:55.118]  Oh, okay.
[02:22:55.158 --> 02:22:56.259]  Hi, Jack.
[02:22:56.279 --> 02:22:57.439]  This is a common mistake.
[02:22:57.780 --> 02:22:58.901]  Well, thank you for joining us.
[02:22:58.941 --> 02:23:01.603]  If you could tell us a little bit about yourself and about the rally.
[02:23:02.463 --> 02:23:02.744]  Okay.
[02:23:02.984 --> 02:23:04.545]  Well, first of all, I just want to say one thing.
[02:23:04.605 --> 02:23:06.246]  It's SaveAmericaFund.org.com.
[02:23:06.407 --> 02:23:06.667]  Okay.
[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:09.321]  Okay, that's important.
[02:23:09.921 --> 02:23:11.522]  Otherwise, people won't be able to access.
[02:23:11.862 --> 02:23:12.202]  Okay.
[02:23:12.262 --> 02:23:22.388]  But, yeah, the Truckers' Rally is taking place nationwide in conjunction with FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform.
[02:23:22.748 --> 02:23:27.711]  They're holding a big event in Washington, D.C.
[02:23:28.131 --> 02:23:30.693]  on April 23rd, 24th, and 25th.
[02:23:32.013 --> 02:23:36.396]  It's called Radio Row, where a lot of talk show hosts and media personalities
[02:23:36.863 --> 02:23:54.655]  are going to be talking from, or broadcasting from Lafayette Park and the Phoenix Hotel to their listeners about the anti-illegal immigration push to stop the amnesty bill that's going through our Congress right now.
[02:23:55.455 --> 02:24:05.702]  And when I first came up with this idea, I called FAIR and asked them, you know, would they be willing to let me sort of like hop on board with what they're doing
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:22.188]  If I were, if I wanted to organize a truckers rally and they said absolutely, you know, we'll help you in any way and we'll be completely supportive, and they have been until, I mean, they're still, they're completely on board and they're very, very supportive and they've been all along.
[02:24:22.328 --> 02:24:29.851]  But, you know, our truckers rally is taking place not only in Washington, D.C., but also in every state capital across the nation.
[02:24:29.871 --> 02:24:35.574]  And what we're asking all the truckers and concerned citizens, because this is not just for truckers alone,
[02:24:36.286 --> 02:24:42.887]  I've had just as many concerned citizens, you know, email me or call me and say, you know, what can I do to support the truckers?
[02:24:42.927 --> 02:24:44.128]  What can I do to help out?
[02:24:44.188 --> 02:24:45.568]  You know, how can I participate?
[02:24:45.588 --> 02:24:47.288]  You know, can I drive with them?
[02:24:47.328 --> 02:24:48.249]  You know, and things like that.
[02:24:48.329 --> 02:24:55.670]  So we've really turned this into a national protest rally rather than just the truckers participating.
[02:24:56.270 --> 02:25:03.992]  And everybody is going to be doing what we are calling a slow rolling protest around the state capitol where they're, you know, basically just going to
[02:25:04.828 --> 02:25:08.569]  Drive as slowly as they possibly can, but, you know, to keep moving.
[02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:24.051]  And, you know, bumper to bumper around the state capitol, outside of the security perimeters, you know, because there are security perimeters around each capitol building that we have to, you know, respect.
[02:25:24.211 --> 02:25:28.352]  But, you know, anything outside of that is, you know, free game.
[02:25:28.372 --> 02:25:28.672]  Sure.
[02:25:29.492 --> 02:25:33.793]  So anyway, that's, and we ask everybody to carry American flags.
[02:25:34.289 --> 02:25:46.470]  In their windows or you know put them on their trucks or cars and everybody have posters and banners on their cars and trucks and even on the tops of the truckers trucks you know especially and on cars too
[02:25:46.943 --> 02:25:50.787]  But at least if news choppers drive by, they can at least see what's going on.
[02:25:50.867 --> 02:25:56.832]  Do you have any idea of how big the protest is going to be in DC or anywhere?
[02:25:56.912 --> 02:25:58.374]  Are there any numbers coming in?
[02:25:58.394 --> 02:26:00.275]  Have you had people pledge support?
[02:26:00.295 --> 02:26:03.679]  Do you have an idea of just how much gridlock this is going to cause?
[02:26:03.699 --> 02:26:04.780]  How successful it might be?
[02:26:06.601 --> 02:26:09.364]  I think it's going to be incredibly successful, that's number one.
[02:26:09.624 --> 02:26:10.625]  But number two, we're
[02:26:11.974 --> 02:26:22.617]  I'm guesstimating, and I know that this is a pretty broad range, but somewhere between 5 and maybe 10 percent of all the truckers in the nation show up.
[02:26:23.137 --> 02:26:32.819]  I might be a little on the high side, but from all the information, I mean, two days ago on Wednesday the 18th, we had over 200,000 hits to our website in one day.
[02:26:37.159 --> 02:26:42.062]  And it absolutely collapsed the site because the broadband just wasn't wide enough.
[02:26:42.102 --> 02:26:46.544]  We had to increase it five times to take all the traffic that's been coming through that site.
[02:26:46.844 --> 02:26:48.165]  And what time exactly?
[02:26:48.185 --> 02:26:52.247]  You say this is a three-day event, April 23rd, 24th, and 25th?
[02:26:52.647 --> 02:26:52.907]  Yes.
[02:26:53.308 --> 02:27:01.292]  Is there a time that you wanted to coordinate people around the country to get this slow rolling truck protest started?
[02:27:01.372 --> 02:27:03.273]  Is there a time that people are just do it all day?
[02:27:04.356 --> 02:27:07.858]  It's just all day from early morning until 5 p.m.
[02:27:08.098 --> 02:27:14.561]  Want to stay with me if you could for a little bit here on the other side of this break and I want to just again clarify what you guys are trying to accomplish.
[02:27:14.581 --> 02:27:20.824]  I want to ask you what reactions you've had or what trouble you've gotten in as the case may be.
[02:27:21.184 --> 02:27:21.824]  Stay tuned folks.
[02:27:21.864 --> 02:27:22.424]  Deadline Live.
[02:27:22.484 --> 02:27:23.525]  SaveAmericaFund.org
[02:27:32.162 --> 02:27:33.082]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.543 --> 02:27:35.203]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.223 --> 02:27:38.864]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.366 --> 02:27:43.366]  How are you feeling today?
[02:27:43.606 --> 02:27:44.066]  Why ask?

[02:28:35.242 --> 02:28:35.543]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[02:28:44.031 --> 02:28:50.834]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:28:51.194 --> 02:28:57.598]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:28:58.078 --> 02:29:07.983]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:29:08.463 --> 02:29:11.925]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:29:12.225 --> 02:29:14.906]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:29:15.547 --> 02:29:18.248]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[02:29:18.788 --> 02:29:22.710]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[02:29:22.770 --> 02:29:24.311]  Box 969 Soquel, S-O-Q-U-E-L, California 95073.
[02:29:24.351 --> 02:29:27.392]  $32 to Radio Liberty Box 969 Soquel, California 95073.
[02:29:27.813 --> 02:29:28.313]  Or call 1-800-544-8927.
[02:29:28.333 --> 02:29:28.393]  1-800-544-8927.
[02:29:42.859 --> 02:29:47.363]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[02:29:47.803 --> 02:29:50.986]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[02:29:51.446 --> 02:29:59.173]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[02:30:00.454 --> 02:30:07.039]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:11.183]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[02:30:11.663 --> 02:30:16.486]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[02:30:16.906 --> 02:30:23.510]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[02:30:24.130 --> 02:30:25.671]  And it's so easy to use!
[02:30:26.192 --> 02:30:32.095]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill-up and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.
[02:30:32.555 --> 02:30:38.919]  So, do yourself and the environment a favor and visit CTSaveGas.com to get your bottle today.
[02:30:39.219 --> 02:30:41.240]  That's CT Save Gas.
[02:31:06.476 --> 02:31:07.677]  We're good to go.
[02:31:28.524 --> 02:31:30.626]  Keep on rockin' in the free world, folks.
[02:31:30.846 --> 02:31:34.749]  That might be a good theme song for this truck-out rally.
[02:31:35.129 --> 02:31:39.092]  We have Wanda Piety on with us, and it is SaveAmericaFun.org.
[02:31:39.112 --> 02:31:39.853]  Is that right, Wanda?
[02:31:39.873 --> 02:31:41.054]  I want to make sure we got that right.
[02:31:41.434 --> 02:31:42.195]  That's correct, Jack.
[02:31:42.255 --> 02:31:42.495]  Thanks.
[02:31:42.515 --> 02:31:42.815]  Okay.
[02:31:43.296 --> 02:31:47.759]  I wish I had more time for you, but I'm glad we had enough time to bring you on and to let people know about this.
[02:31:47.779 --> 02:31:52.223]  I know, you know, a lot of truckers listen to this five-hour block of programming.
[02:31:52.663 --> 02:31:54.803]  here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:31:54.824 --> 02:32:02.945]  So if they're not in this, they don't know how to get involved in it, they need more information, they can go to SaveAmericaFund.org and get all of the details that they need.
[02:32:03.285 --> 02:32:08.887]  I'm interested, just be real clear to our listeners here, what exactly is the goal?
[02:32:08.947 --> 02:32:11.267]  What are you trying to accomplish with the Truck Out Rally?
[02:32:12.247 --> 02:32:13.768]  Well, it's two-fold.
[02:32:15.008 --> 02:32:19.889]  The Truckers Rally really started out because, you know, George Bush
[02:32:20.700 --> 02:32:42.477]  The end of April, he's going to be allowing 100 Mexican trucking companies to start running their trucks in America on a pilot test program to bring all of the Mexican truckers, you know, to open our borders with the North American Union and to allow all Mexican truckers and trucking companies into America.
[02:32:42.497 --> 02:32:47.261]  Now that doesn't sound like it's a very good thing to do when you're fighting an international war against terrorism.
[02:32:48.405 --> 02:32:48.886]  It's not.
[02:32:48.986 --> 02:32:52.752]  It's absolutely antithetical to that whole ideology.
[02:32:52.772 --> 02:32:57.159]  I mean, it's promoting terrorism in this country is what it's doing.
[02:33:00.749 --> 02:33:03.911]  And terrorist behavior in this country is what he's doing right now.
[02:33:04.111 --> 02:33:08.753]  And this obviously is going to bite into, you know, what a trucker can make to support his family.
[02:33:08.813 --> 02:33:10.194]  It's getting harder and harder to do.
[02:33:10.234 --> 02:33:12.775]  We've seen this happen with the construction industry here.
[02:33:13.335 --> 02:33:15.757]  These, of course, are the jobs that no one else wants.
[02:33:15.817 --> 02:33:23.360]  Well, I'm sorry to say, you know, trucking made this country great, and so did construction, and the wages are consistently going down.
[02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:24.721]  I'm sure you're aware of that, Wanda.
[02:33:24.741 --> 02:33:26.042]  So that's a good thing.
[02:33:26.062 --> 02:33:28.323]  And then you said there was a second thing that you wanted to promote as well?
[02:33:28.823 --> 02:33:53.051]  Well, it's the North American Union, and what, you know, the bigger picture is the truckers coming into America is only a symptom of the bigger problem, and the bigger problem of the two is really the fact that the Committee on Foreign Relations, the One World Order, you know, is pushing for the North American Union, and that's where Canada, America, and Mexico would become one country.
[02:33:53.689 --> 02:33:54.330]  I'm going to
[02:34:14.989 --> 02:34:17.010]  of America, of the United States of America.
[02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:18.970]  We would be citizens of nothing anymore.
[02:34:18.990 --> 02:34:24.692]  And we would exchange our rights for privileges, something I don't think anybody wants to see happen.
[02:34:24.712 --> 02:34:26.292]  What about the reactions?
[02:34:26.332 --> 02:34:30.594]  What about the opposition to this mass organization of this three-day truck rally?
[02:34:31.294 --> 02:34:36.556]  Well, you know, we've done this through a grassroots effort, so we really haven't had any opposition yet.
[02:34:37.096 --> 02:34:41.217]  In fact, quite remarkably, I sent out a press release through a national press
[02:34:42.044 --> 02:34:49.666]  PR agency to 14,000 national newsrooms across the nation.
[02:34:50.246 --> 02:34:49.666]  14,000!
[02:34:50.606 --> 02:34:52.926]  It should have been in every single newsroom in every single state.
[02:34:52.946 --> 02:34:57.447]  So the reaction has been no reaction, just to ignore the entire event.
[02:34:57.707 --> 02:34:58.668]  Yeah, just to ignore it.
[02:34:58.768 --> 02:35:09.210]  And I've only gotten two calls from mainstream radio broadcast shows, one of which I'll be on today, you know, John and Ken's show on AM 640 AM, you know, at 4 o'clock.
[02:35:10.014 --> 02:35:10.594]  But that's it!
[02:35:11.094 --> 02:35:15.616]  Just two radio shows have been brave enough to broadcast.
[02:35:15.676 --> 02:35:17.636]  All the rest have just completely ignored it.
[02:35:17.656 --> 02:35:19.337]  Which is par for the course.
[02:35:19.417 --> 02:35:20.137]  We see this happen all the time.
[02:35:20.157 --> 02:35:21.497]  Yeah, but that's not the state of our media.
[02:35:21.517 --> 02:35:23.758]  It's completely controlled by the CFR.
[02:35:24.278 --> 02:35:25.318]  That's well put.
[02:35:25.798 --> 02:35:31.140]  There are a lot of instructions, so I want everybody to go to SaveAmericaFund.org if you're going to participate in this.
[02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:35.162]  Not to say that there are rules, but you need to act respectful.
[02:35:35.182 --> 02:35:36.643]  You need to put on your best face.
[02:35:36.663 --> 02:35:39.465]  You need to let emergency vehicles go by.
[02:35:40.105 --> 02:35:42.767]  Not block the roadways in case there is an emergency.
[02:35:43.207 --> 02:35:49.971]  So there are a few suggestions in participating in the rally, but it does start the 23rd, the 24th, the 25th.
[02:35:50.011 --> 02:35:51.452]  Go to your nearest Capitol.
[02:35:52.153 --> 02:35:55.915]  And then of course the Beltway in Washington DC will probably be the biggest
[02:35:56.895 --> 02:36:07.840]  I'm hoping to get some truckers on the line live from the rally if you know anybody that wants to come on the air with us and talk from the rally and maybe call in through cell phone while they're participating in the rally.
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:09.981]  I'd like to cover that live as it happens.
[02:36:10.562 --> 02:36:12.243]  Again, I wish I had more time for you, Wanda.
[02:36:12.303 --> 02:36:13.123]  I wish you a lot of luck.
[02:36:13.143 --> 02:36:14.363]  I think this is a great idea.
[02:36:14.384 --> 02:36:17.385]  This definitely will wake people up to the problem.
[02:36:17.765 --> 02:36:20.846]  And then we can start having the debate to, you know, what the solutions are.
[02:36:21.066 --> 02:36:27.048]  Not the solutions the CFR provide for us, but of course, the solutions that empower Americans here in this country.
[02:36:27.449 --> 02:36:28.889]  Any final comments before we let you go?
[02:36:29.409 --> 02:36:41.834]  Yes, um, you know, for any of the people out there that don't, um, that don't, you know, don't find out about this in time to participate, you know, I would just say please don't fret because we've got something else planned.
[02:36:42.955 --> 02:36:49.945]  Hang in there and just keep logging on to the website SaveAmericaFund.org because there's a lot of stuff that's being planned.
[02:36:50.305 --> 02:36:51.327]  Well, I'm proud of you.
[02:36:51.347 --> 02:36:53.510]  You're fighting back and that's exactly what we need to do.
[02:36:53.570 --> 02:36:54.772]  Best of luck to you, Wanda.
[02:36:54.792 --> 02:36:58.537]  Thank you for bringing this to our attention and we'll monitor the situation as it moves forward.
[02:36:58.557 --> 02:36:59.098]  Thank you very much.
[02:37:00.474 --> 02:37:00.954]  You got it.
[02:37:01.234 --> 02:37:02.715]  SaveAmericaFund.org.
[02:37:02.795 --> 02:37:05.097]  Lots of more details on there.
[02:37:05.177 --> 02:37:07.699]  Well, we have a lot more information to impart to you.
[02:37:08.099 --> 02:37:09.480]  Unfortunately, we're running out of time.
[02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:12.642]  I'm going to just take your calls until the end of the show.
[02:37:12.682 --> 02:37:18.266]  Before I do that, I don't want to forget, if you're living in Texas, I will be appearing
[02:37:18.966 --> 02:37:29.218]  In Dallas, Texas, tomorrow night, the 21st of April, 2007, I will be hosting and speaking at a political art show at Nine Eyes Tattoo Studio.
[02:37:29.238 --> 02:37:33.804]  There's going to be a lot of music and free drink and free food, limited capacity seating.
[02:37:33.824 --> 02:37:36.407]  There's going to be some great political artwork there as well.
[02:37:37.047 --> 02:37:40.230]  This is a cultural revolution, and I'm glad to be a part of it.
[02:37:40.591 --> 02:37:48.118]  The event is called Thought Criminals, and you can go to 60secondape.com or go to jackblood.com.
[02:37:48.338 --> 02:37:52.923]  Look at my appearances page, and I'd love to see everybody up there tomorrow night up in Dallas, Texas.
[02:37:52.963 --> 02:37:53.644]  We love Dallas.
[02:37:53.664 --> 02:37:55.966]  We want to keep it moving forward in the right direction.
[02:37:55.986 --> 02:37:59.029]  Keep the info war on the front lines in Dallas, Texas.
[02:37:59.069 --> 02:38:00.550]  We'll need your help to do that tomorrow.
[02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:01.051]  This is great.
[02:38:01.751 --> 02:38:06.996]  For those of you who love culture and love parapolitics mixed together, I'll see you all up there tomorrow night.
[02:38:07.036 --> 02:38:09.257]  Going back to the phones, I've got Ron in New York.
[02:38:09.638 --> 02:38:12.040]  Ron, I've got to make all these calls quick, but you're on the air.
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:13.000]  Hello, Jack.
[02:38:13.561 --> 02:38:20.807]  Jack, one thing I would ask all listeners, all listeners, Americans who are listening to this call to do,
[02:38:21.633 --> 02:38:27.154]  Is to observe and be very vigilant at this period to reactions from this tragedy.
[02:38:27.695 --> 02:38:32.796]  Of course, I've been monitoring the news media very closely, papers, radio, television, since this occurred.
[02:38:33.356 --> 02:38:41.378]  And what's coming out of it is there's certain entities, political entities, that are opportunistically trying, I think, or would like to exploit this.
[02:38:42.239 --> 02:38:47.884]  One is, okay, Fox News first and foremost, followed closely by MSNBC.
[02:38:48.444 --> 02:38:49.665]  They put out information.
[02:38:49.685 --> 02:38:52.447]  There's no qualification where the information comes from.
[02:38:52.467 --> 02:38:53.688]  I have an idea.
[02:38:53.708 --> 02:38:59.613]  No, they speculate wildly, and when we try to fill in some of the blanks, we're called the conspiracy theorists.
[02:38:59.633 --> 02:39:02.656]  That's why I've always said I'm a conspiracy debunker, Ron.
[02:39:02.676 --> 02:39:03.016]  Go ahead.
[02:39:03.116 --> 02:39:05.218]  They purport the information to be fact.
[02:39:05.638 --> 02:39:08.801]  The thing I talked to you about the last few days with adjudication,
[02:39:09.602 --> 02:39:21.061]  That was a speculation put out by Shepard Smith of Fox News, then perpetuated by Bill O'Reilly, which last night his appearance with an esteemed and very learned law professor was disgusting.
[02:39:21.101 --> 02:39:22.584]  He told them he didn't care about the law.
[02:39:23.647 --> 02:39:27.409]  Um, we got people out there that think these men are conservatives.
[02:39:27.489 --> 02:39:29.390]  These are not truly conservatives.
[02:39:29.410 --> 02:39:38.935]  No, I mean, when Rush Limbaugh gets on the air on and says that the Constitution aids the terrorists and calls it the Terrorist Bill of Rights, I think we know right where they're coming from, don't we?
[02:39:38.955 --> 02:39:40.036]  They're out to tear it down.
[02:39:40.236 --> 02:39:41.056]  And due process.
[02:39:41.076 --> 02:39:42.557]  They're going after due process.
[02:39:42.577 --> 02:39:45.559]  I don't know if people understand that, but there's a subtle undercurrent here.
[02:39:46.139 --> 02:39:50.361]  In which they want to go after your 230 year right of due process.
[02:39:50.621 --> 02:39:51.762]  That's what they're really after.
[02:39:51.942 --> 02:39:53.243]  Ron, thanks for the call.
[02:39:53.303 --> 02:39:54.143]  I gotta keep moving.
[02:39:54.163 --> 02:39:56.604]  You're always a great call, but we've got a lot of callers that want to get in.
[02:39:56.644 --> 02:39:57.245]  Thank you very much.
[02:39:57.285 --> 02:39:58.025]  Have a great weekend.
[02:39:58.305 --> 02:40:00.806]  Let's go to Tammy in Illinois.
[02:40:00.846 --> 02:40:01.827]  Tammy, thank you for holding.
[02:40:01.847 --> 02:40:02.928]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:03.708 --> 02:40:04.088]  Hi there.
[02:40:04.528 --> 02:40:11.652]  Yes, I just wanted to call and say that Monday at 1230, police responded to a handgun in possession of a 17 year old at Rock Island High School in Illinois.
[02:40:12.132 --> 02:40:13.393]  They didn't put it in the paper until the 18th.
[02:40:14.366 --> 02:40:16.153]  They also said automated calls went out.
[02:40:16.294 --> 02:40:18.261]  A lot of parents said they didn't receive any.
[02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:26.183]  Also today at 1030 a.m., Scott Community College in Iowa closed and evacuated because the words VT here today were found on the back wall.
[02:40:26.243 --> 02:40:28.465]  Yes, and we had the same thing happen in California.
[02:40:28.485 --> 02:40:45.172]  I mean, are these coordinated attacks or is our prediction coming true that by NBC running and glorifying this shooter at Virginia Tech, we're seeing people who want to be famous all over the country, you know, using these provocateur methods to put us all in a riotous situation?
[02:40:45.192 --> 02:40:46.413]  I mean, this is unbelievable!
[02:40:46.949 --> 02:41:04.014]  Yes, I emailed MSNBC the day that they were showing all them horrible pictures, and it was really just astounding to me that there were so many of them everywhere that you couldn't help but not open up the computer or turn on the TV or listen to the radio without hearing it and seeing all this.
[02:41:04.154 --> 02:41:06.755]  And also, there's also something strange going on.
[02:41:07.195 --> 02:41:15.057]  When we go to Prison Planet and we try to email ourselves a copy of the front page, it's now coming up instead of just saying
[02:41:16.161 --> 02:41:23.549]  I don't and the guys over at the studio are going to have to check into that I would think Tammy but that is amazing so you're calling in with more threats
[02:41:36.163 --> 02:41:39.386]  More potential gun action in schools in Illinois.
[02:41:39.446 --> 02:41:41.688]  As you mentioned, there's some going on around the country.
[02:41:41.708 --> 02:41:43.389]  We had a caller earlier from Minnesota.
[02:41:43.449 --> 02:41:46.772]  Their children were locked up in a gymnasium due to bomb threats.
[02:41:47.032 --> 02:41:49.153]  32, I believe, schools in California closed today.
[02:41:49.434 --> 02:41:50.975]  Schools in Texas closing.
[02:41:51.015 --> 02:41:54.277]  I mean, this is just an unbelievable situation.
[02:41:54.838 --> 02:41:56.479]  I can't even find the words to comment on it.
[02:41:56.519 --> 02:41:58.100]  Thank you for that update, Tammy.
[02:41:58.140 --> 02:42:02.804]  That needs to be included, I would think, in any story regarding this particular incident.
[02:42:02.824 --> 02:42:04.184]  Let's go to James in Maryland.
[02:42:04.224 --> 02:42:05.264]  James, thank you for holding.
[02:42:05.285 --> 02:42:06.405]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:07.145 --> 02:42:07.645]  Hi, Jack.
[02:42:07.665 --> 02:42:07.985]  Thanks.
[02:42:08.065 --> 02:42:10.246]  I was just listening to another truth show.
[02:42:12.286 --> 02:42:15.807]  Phillip Glover on AM 840 at 10 PM.
[02:42:16.247 --> 02:42:17.407]  Everybody should check that out.
[02:42:17.847 --> 02:42:21.848]  And I was wondering if you were acquainted with these facts.
[02:42:22.488 --> 02:42:27.069]  The unit, the CBS show, The Unit, last week had a Virginia school taken over by a gunman.
[02:42:28.169 --> 02:42:28.429]  No.
[02:42:28.849 --> 02:42:29.930]  Yeah, The Unit.
[02:42:30.490 --> 02:42:31.090]  It's a show.
[02:42:31.170 --> 02:42:31.950]  I've never seen it.
[02:42:32.702 --> 02:42:36.607]  It's on CBS and last week they had a Virginia school taken over by a gunman.
[02:42:36.947 --> 02:42:44.217]  This I believe is the show with the former president from the TV show 24 starring Dennis Haspard I believe is his name.
[02:42:44.907 --> 02:43:08.477]  They had, you're telling, I mean, this reminds me, doesn't it remind you of the Lone Gunman episode in regards to 9-11, where they had, again, the towers attacked in a fictional scenario on Lone Gunman, and you're telling me that a show called The Unit, last week, I don't watch any of these shows, had a mock, a fictional account of a mass shooting at Virginia Tech.
[02:43:08.997 --> 02:43:13.759]  Mass shooting, I don't know what I was, the quote was, school taken over by gunmen.
[02:43:15.414 --> 02:43:20.658]  And the other piece of information is that Dennis Kucinich just called for a total gun ban.
[02:43:21.999 --> 02:43:29.365]  Yeah, I mean, we have other people who are, I guess, somewhat interested in reinvestigating 9-11 all out calling for gun bans.
[02:43:30.166 --> 02:43:32.988]  So I can't make any sense of Dennis Kucinich at all.
[02:43:33.721 --> 02:43:37.222]  Well, I mean, yeah, he also loves the United Nations.
[02:43:37.282 --> 02:43:39.123]  I mean, he's got a lot of problems.
[02:43:39.163 --> 02:43:40.884]  But then again, he wants the liberal vote.
[02:43:40.924 --> 02:43:45.306]  He wants the far-left, liberal, mind-control, robot, radical vote.
[02:43:45.366 --> 02:43:47.587]  And maybe he just might get it, the way he's talking.
[02:43:48.247 --> 02:43:50.208]  He's not getting any votes from this show, I don't think.
[02:43:50.688 --> 02:43:52.128]  Well, I thank you for all your work, Jack.
[02:43:52.148 --> 02:43:52.529]  Take care.
[02:43:52.569 --> 02:43:54.669]  Tim in Nebraska, thank you for calling in.
[02:43:54.709 --> 02:43:55.910]  You were on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:55.930 --> 02:43:56.370]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:43:57.090 --> 02:43:59.211]  Yeah, back to that truck-out-strike thing.
[02:43:59.691 --> 02:44:03.293]  That website that the lady mentioned, I can't remember what it is right now.
[02:44:03.976 --> 02:44:06.398]  Has some printable forms.
[02:44:07.639 --> 02:44:12.662]  And we printed a bunch of those up and took them out to a big Flying J truck stop out here.
[02:44:12.682 --> 02:44:14.723]  It's SaveAmericaFund.org.
[02:44:14.744 --> 02:44:15.244]  Good for you.
[02:44:15.264 --> 02:44:16.965]  So you're spreading the word about the truck out.
[02:44:17.465 --> 02:44:20.327]  And I couldn't believe how receptive everyone was to it.
[02:44:21.028 --> 02:44:23.750]  And about a fourth of them already knew about it.
[02:44:24.750 --> 02:44:30.915]  And I was also amazed at all the Mexican drivers that were waiting in line for gas or diesel.
[02:44:33.365 --> 02:44:49.715]  Well, we heard, I don't know if they're still doing this, a while back they were rebroadcasting our shows on CB radios for all the truckers so that they could listen to it and a couple of truckers didn't like that, but I think, you know, in light of the information we've been putting out today and promoting the truck rally, I think they might want to rethink that, but good for you.
[02:44:49.735 --> 02:44:51.316]  Yeah, it's real easy to do.
[02:44:51.396 --> 02:44:52.556]  People ought to get out and do it.
[02:44:52.977 --> 02:44:54.918]  Hey, one more thing, I want to apologize to
[02:44:55.805 --> 02:44:59.246]  Coming up to you in Los Angeles and introducing myself while you're eating dinner.
[02:44:59.366 --> 02:44:59.946]  Oh, whatever.
[02:45:00.207 --> 02:45:00.927]  I'm glad you did.
[02:45:00.967 --> 02:45:07.029]  It was great to meet all you guys out there in Los Angeles and I'll always make time to meet the people at the rallies and events we go to.
[02:45:07.049 --> 02:45:08.830]  We've got Alex Jones back on the line as well.
[02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:10.430]  Alex, thanks for checking in.
[02:45:10.450 --> 02:45:10.890]  What do you got?
[02:45:12.291 --> 02:45:13.031]  You bet, Jack.
[02:45:13.771 --> 02:45:17.472]  With the sound of seagulls in the background, I call in just for the one minute quick report.
[02:45:17.553 --> 02:45:18.333]  Paul Watson is
[02:45:19.318 --> 02:45:21.819]  Putting up a story that we've been working on for four days.
[02:45:21.859 --> 02:45:25.341]  We've talked to multiple witnesses, including Mr. Gazzini.
[02:45:25.421 --> 02:45:28.803]  I remember when he called out a year and a half ago, going, they're doing weird drills on Americans.
[02:45:29.143 --> 02:45:30.344]  Please don't put me in the camp.
[02:45:30.844 --> 02:45:31.605]  They're at the school.
[02:45:31.705 --> 02:45:34.166]  I've shot video of this on both sides of the country.
[02:45:35.356 --> 02:45:40.161]  This goes on... You guys have got to include the mass school closures and the mass hoaxes.
[02:45:40.521 --> 02:45:52.854]  Did you just hear the last caller, Alex, call in and say in the unit they had again, like the Lone Gunman series, had said something about a shooting at Virginia Tech a week ago and put that in their fictional TV program?
[02:45:53.855 --> 02:45:55.196]  They always do it.
[02:45:55.416 --> 02:45:57.256]  It's a little card, a little calling card.
[02:45:57.276 --> 02:46:00.138]  Psychopaths always leave something.
[02:46:00.558 --> 02:46:01.878]  They always take a trophy.
[02:46:02.559 --> 02:46:06.360]  And they admit that the CIA and others go and plant these stories.
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:14.463]  And I've had, you know, high-level people come from the lone gunman and ex-files like Dean Haglund saying that the CIA would plant stuff on them.
[02:46:14.563 --> 02:46:23.207]  And you've done stories on this that Freemasons in general have to tell you what they're going to do ahead of time, kind of a cremation of care ceremony.
[02:46:23.952 --> 02:46:25.152]  Yeah, they're really high-level ones.
[02:46:25.172 --> 02:46:27.913]  You know, the general run of the millmasons never become even real masons.
[02:46:27.973 --> 02:46:29.054]  They're poor commissions.
[02:46:29.074 --> 02:46:29.794]  But here's the deal.
[02:46:30.534 --> 02:46:32.194]  We need to run down that and confirm.
[02:46:33.135 --> 02:46:34.095]  There's too much happening.
[02:46:34.115 --> 02:46:35.235]  We can't keep track of it all.
[02:46:35.315 --> 02:46:36.116]  Write emails.
[02:46:36.236 --> 02:46:37.036]  Write articles.
[02:46:37.156 --> 02:46:37.996]  We're posting them.
[02:46:38.056 --> 02:46:42.758]  Send them to Aaron at InfoWars.com, to Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:46:42.878 --> 02:46:44.238]  Help us hit every angle.
[02:46:44.558 --> 02:46:47.479]  Help us write an article, listeners, about the history of gun control.
[02:46:47.979 --> 02:46:56.382]  All the carnage and what's happened, and all the disarmed victims, and then all the examples of people that have been armed and stopped these type of events.
[02:46:56.482 --> 02:46:56.903]  Help us!
[02:46:56.943 --> 02:46:58.463]  We're fighting for the Second Amendment.
[02:46:58.763 --> 02:47:00.064]  We're fighting for America.
[02:47:00.084 --> 02:47:02.965]  You know, I'm literally on my two-day vacation.
[02:47:03.125 --> 02:47:04.906]  I'm fighting it right now here with Jack.
[02:47:05.366 --> 02:47:07.367]  But Paul's going up with a big exclusive.
[02:47:07.407 --> 02:47:08.347]  We have it confirmed.
[02:47:09.187 --> 02:47:20.132]  From multiple sources, including police officers, medical workers, and others that I've talked to, that Matt Kaziz has talked to, that there was federal control, the feds ordered the stand down.
[02:47:20.572 --> 02:47:25.974]  That is absolutely huge, just like they did with Columbine.
[02:47:26.154 --> 02:47:28.475]  Regardless, they're now culpable for most of the deaths.
[02:47:28.995 --> 02:47:35.778]  When this story goes up in the next few hours, and it's nighttime over there, but Paul's working on Friday night at, you know, 8 o'clock at night right now,
[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:37.921]  Get it, get it out to everybody.
[02:47:37.961 --> 02:47:39.361]  Folks, I know I say this every day now.
[02:47:39.421 --> 02:47:45.323]  I didn't use to say this once a month and you'd respond why I said it, but things are moving faster and faster, quicker and quicker.
[02:47:45.783 --> 02:47:51.845]  You've all got to put out the maximum effort right now because the new world order, we've got them cornered.
[02:47:52.105 --> 02:47:53.286]  We're becoming more effective.
[02:47:53.306 --> 02:47:54.666]  They're becoming more aggressive.
[02:47:54.986 --> 02:47:59.428]  We're in the fight, but we're not winning right now where both sides are bloodied.
[02:47:59.848 --> 02:48:03.569]  So when this story comes out on PrisonPlanet.com in the next few hours,
[02:48:04.609 --> 02:48:10.573]  Concerning the Feds ordering the stand down and the Blacksburg Black Op.
[02:48:11.634 --> 02:48:16.497]  We also need to get that photo of him in the Marine Corps ROTC in the Black Op mask.
[02:48:17.138 --> 02:48:19.099]  Literally in a Marine Corps Black Op mask.
[02:48:19.500 --> 02:48:25.143]  We need to get this out to everybody and find out who the Caucasian is with him.
[02:48:25.424 --> 02:48:26.604]  Jack, thanks for doing the show.
[02:48:26.624 --> 02:48:27.685]  Final segment's coming up.
[02:48:28.025 --> 02:48:28.546]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:28.566 --> 02:48:29.707]  We'll be right back after this, folks.
[02:48:29.747 --> 02:48:30.107]  Stay tuned.
[02:48:45.097 --> 02:48:50.540]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:58.524]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:59.272 --> 02:49:06.335]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:06.715 --> 02:49:18.140]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:21.962]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:22.402 --> 02:49:24.363]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:24.683 --> 02:49:28.525]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:41.980 --> 02:49:47.203]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:47.363 --> 02:49:55.446]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:55.707 --> 02:50:02.750]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:02.930 --> 02:50:04.211]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:50:04.291 --> 02:50:10.193]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:10.373 --> 02:50:15.456]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:15.576 --> 02:50:24.439]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:29.322]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at
[02:50:33.143 --> 02:50:43.545]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:43.765 --> 02:50:47.466]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:47.786 --> 02:50:56.728]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:50:56.888 --> 02:51:01.729]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:01.989 --> 02:51:11.014]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[02:51:11.335 --> 02:51:17.298]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[02:51:50.922 --> 02:51:53.043]  Alright, final segment today on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:53.063 --> 02:51:55.604]  Again, I've been Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[02:51:55.664 --> 02:51:59.206]  I should be back sitting in for Alex on Monday as well.
[02:51:59.266 --> 02:52:02.968]  My show follows the Alex Jones Show Monday through Friday, 2 p.m.
[02:52:03.088 --> 02:52:04.749]  Central Time on this very network.
[02:52:05.129 --> 02:52:07.510]  Michael Parenti is scheduled to be our guest today.
[02:52:07.610 --> 02:52:12.092]  Also, Deb from Free Shoes Posse, talking about 9-11 Citizens Grand Juries.
[02:52:12.553 --> 02:52:13.673]  We've got a lot of information.
[02:52:13.693 --> 02:52:17.255]  I'll also get into, on our program, this Ismael Axe.
[02:52:17.555 --> 02:52:17.836]  Yes, we are.
[02:52:36.957 --> 02:52:38.698]  Giving me the opportunity to plug all those things.
[02:52:38.979 --> 02:52:42.121]  Going right back to the phones, we've got to do rapid fire here.
[02:52:42.141 --> 02:52:44.783]  Everybody can get something on the record, if we can get to everybody.
[02:52:45.243 --> 02:52:46.805]  I'll go to Paula in Florida first.
[02:52:46.865 --> 02:52:48.786]  Paula, quick comments, set the record straight.
[02:52:49.267 --> 02:52:50.888]  Yeah, hi hon, I just got some good news for you.
[02:52:50.908 --> 02:52:53.109]  There's something being done about all these psychotropic drugs.
[02:52:53.490 --> 02:52:55.992]  The government up there and watch their reps are doing something about it right now.
[02:52:56.832 --> 02:53:01.056]  And we told them exactly what was going on, you know, with these drugs and what they were doing to everybody.
[02:53:01.096 --> 02:53:04.158]  We've got to hold the hospitals, we've got to hold the VA, we've got to hold the pharmacies.
[02:53:04.676 --> 02:53:05.777]  Yeah, I already talked to you just a little bit ago.
[02:53:05.797 --> 02:53:06.938]  I was left on, so I'm still listening.
[02:53:31.294 --> 02:53:32.495]  All right, did you have something to add here?
[02:53:32.515 --> 02:53:33.515]  We're almost out of time, Tim.
[02:53:33.835 --> 02:53:34.595]  No, good show.
[02:53:34.696 --> 02:53:36.436]  Thank you very much for joining us today.
[02:53:36.496 --> 02:53:38.277]  Let's go to Kyle in Iowa.
[02:53:38.457 --> 02:53:39.698]  Kyle, thank you for joining us.
[02:53:39.738 --> 02:53:40.738]  Say that three times fast.
[02:53:40.758 --> 02:53:41.238]  You're on the air.
[02:53:42.199 --> 02:53:42.879]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:53:43.159 --> 02:53:45.020]  I got a quick New World Order question for you.
[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:50.622]  I'm new to the whole 9-11 truth thing, and I've been studying the New World Order intensely of late.
[02:53:50.963 --> 02:53:51.843]  I got a question for you.
[02:53:52.263 --> 02:54:00.807]  I had heard Alex on, I think it was on YouTube, I watched him say something about how we were planning on going to Iran, Syria, and then China.
[02:54:01.506 --> 02:54:04.810]  Don't forget Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
[02:54:04.830 --> 02:54:07.893]  I hate to tell them over there that they're also on the target list.
[02:54:07.933 --> 02:54:09.014]  We've seen the white papers.
[02:54:09.074 --> 02:54:09.374]  Go ahead.
[02:54:10.055 --> 02:54:16.701]  Okay, now I understand that there's a Chinese faction of the Illuminati based off the Lee family bloodline.
[02:54:16.742 --> 02:54:19.464]  I'm assuming they're in power over there in China right now.
[02:54:19.484 --> 02:54:24.489]  Now my question is, if we're planning on going over to China, is that an example of
[02:54:25.566 --> 02:54:28.789]  Illuminati infighting, if you will, or is that a smokescreen?
[02:54:28.889 --> 02:54:36.454]  Yeah, the middle managers, the Matrix Moles, as I like to call them, are constantly set upon, they're constantly made to fight themselves.
[02:54:36.534 --> 02:54:41.718]  It's a divide and rule philosophy coming from who I call the Neo-Pharaohs.
[02:54:41.758 --> 02:54:48.924]  These are the money people and the royalty, the divine right to rule group who have been in charge, in my opinion, for many, many years.
[02:54:49.264 --> 02:54:51.905]  So it's infighting, but it's also part of the program.
[02:54:51.945 --> 02:54:53.326]  I mean, order out of chaos.
[02:54:53.366 --> 02:54:54.566]  You've heard that term before.
[02:54:54.947 --> 02:55:04.871]  And Russia, China, the Pope, England, the new potential Prime Minister of England, the Bush family, Clintons, they all call for a new world order.
[02:55:04.911 --> 02:55:11.654]  In fact, we had a clip of Barack Obama on David Letterman's show the other night, also calling for world order, new world order.
[02:55:12.014 --> 02:55:13.255]  So on that,
[02:55:13.755 --> 02:55:14.616]  plan anyway.
[02:55:14.676 --> 02:55:17.237]  They agree, but they do disagree on a number of things.
[02:55:17.258 --> 02:55:21.300]  It's easy to get them to fight each other and of course who's going to pay for that?
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:22.201]  That's me and you.
[02:55:22.741 --> 02:55:28.785]  The cheerleaders are out selling us a war we can't afford, putting up our resources as collateral for these wars.
[02:55:29.066 --> 02:55:34.249]  This has been done for millennia and specifically for the last couple of hundred years.
[02:55:34.289 --> 02:55:35.710]  I hope that answered your question.
[02:55:35.810 --> 02:55:38.412]  It was a big question and we didn't have time for a long answer.
[02:55:38.812 --> 02:55:41.135]  I apologize that we didn't get to everybody else.
[02:55:41.155 --> 02:55:44.180]  You're welcome to call into my program following this show Monday through Friday.
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:45.742]  I thank you for joining us, folks.
[02:55:45.782 --> 02:55:50.849]  Get out there, fight the New World Order, and remember, be bold, and mighty forces will come to your aid.
